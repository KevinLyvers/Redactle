food, preservation, includes, processes, that, make, food, more, resistant, to, microorganism, growth, and, slow, the, oxidation, of, fats, this, slows, down, the, decomposition, and, rancidification, process, food, preservation, may, also, include, processes, that, inhibit, visual, deterioration, such, as, the, enzymatic, browning, reaction, in, apples, after, they, are, cut, during, food, preparation, by, preserving, food, food, waste, can, be, reduced, which, is, an, important, way, to, decrease, production, costs, and, increase, the, efficiency, of, food, systems, improve, food, security, and, nutrition, and, contribute, towards, environmental, sustainability, for, instance, it, can, reduce, the, environmental, impact, of, food, production, many, processes, designed, to, preserve, food, involve, more, than, one, food, preservation, method, preserving, fruit, by, turning, it, into, jam, for, example, involves, boiling, to, reduce, the, fruit, s, moisture, content, and, to, kill, bacteria, etc, sugaring, to, prevent, their, re, growth, and, sealing, within, an, airtight, jar, to, prevent, recontamination, different, food, preservation, methods, have, different, impacts, on, the, quality, of, the, food, and, food, systems, some, traditional, methods, of, preserving, food, have, been, shown, to, have, a, lower, energy, input, and, carbon, footprint, compared, to, modern, methods, some, methods, of, food, preservation, are, also, known, to, create, carcinogens, some, techniques, of, food, preservation, pre, date, the, dawn, of, agriculture, others, were, discovered, more, recently, boiling, liquids, can, kill, any, existing, microbes, milk, and, water, are, often, boiled, to, kill, any, harmful, microbes, that, may, be, present, in, them, burial, of, food, can, preserve, it, due, to, a, variety, of, factors, lack, of, light, lack, of, oxygen, cool, temperatures, ph, level, or, desiccants, in, the, soil, burial, may, be, combined, with, other, methods, such, as, salting, or, fermentation, most, foods, can, be, preserved, in, soil, that, is, very, dry, and, salty, thus, a, desiccant, such, as, sand, or, soil, that, is, frozen, many, root, vegetables, are, very, resistant, to, spoilage, and, require, no, other, preservation, than, storage, in, cool, dark, conditions, for, example, by, burial, in, the, ground, such, as, in, a, storage, clamp, not, to, be, confused, with, a, root, cellar, cabbage, was, traditionally, buried, during, autumn, in, northern, us, farms, for, preservation, some, methods, keep, it, crispy, while, other, methods, produce, sauerkraut, a, similar, process, is, used, in, the, traditional, production, of, kimchi, sometimes, meat, is, buried, under, conditions, that, cause, preservation, if, buried, on, hot, coals, or, ashes, the, heat, can, kill, pathogens, the, dry, ash, can, desiccate, and, the, earth, can, block, oxygen, and, further, contamination, if, buried, where, the, earth, is, very, cold, the, earth, acts, like, a, refrigerator, or, in, areas, of, permafrost, a, freezer, in, odisha, india, it, is, practical, to, store, rice, by, burying, it, underground, this, method, helps, to, store, for, three, to, six, months, during, the, dry, season, butter, and, similar, substances, have, been, preserved, as, bog, butter, in, irish, peat, bogs, for, centuries, century, eggs, are, traditionally, created, by, placing, eggs, in, alkaline, mud, or, other, alkaline, substance, resulting, in, their, inorganic, fermentation, through, raised, ph, instead, of, spoiling, the, fermentation, preserves, them, and, breaks, down, some, of, the, complex, less, flavorful, proteins, and, fats, into, simpler, more, flavorful, ones, canning, involves, cooking, food, sealing, it, in, sterilized, cans, or, jars, and, boiling, the, containers, to, kill, or, weaken, any, remaining, bacteria, as, a, form, of, sterilization, it, was, invented, by, the, french, confectioner, nicolas, appert, by, 1806, this, process, was, used, by, the, french, navy, to, preserve, meat, fruit, vegetables, and, even, milk, although, appert, had, discovered, a, new, way, of, preservation, it, was, not, understood, until, 1864, when, louis, pasteur, found, the, relationship, between, microorganisms, food, spoilage, and, illness, foods, have, varying, degrees, of, natural, protection, against, spoilage, and, may, require, that, the, final, step, occurs, in, a, pressure, cooker, high, acid, fruits, like, strawberries, require, no, preservatives, to, can, and, only, a, short, boiling, cycle, whereas, marginal, vegetables, such, as, carrots, require, longer, boiling, and, the, addition, of, other, acidic, elements, low, acid, foods, such, as, vegetables, and, meats, require, pressure, canning, food, preserved, by, canning, or, bottling, is, at, immediate, risk, of, spoilage, once, the, can, or, bottle, has, been, opened, lack, of, quality, control, in, the, canning, process, may, allow, ingress, of, water, or, micro, organisms, most, such, failures, are, rapidly, detected, as, decomposition, within, the, can, cause, gas, production, and, the, can, will, swell, or, burst, however, there, have, been, examples, of, poor, manufacture, underprocessing, and, poor, hygiene, allowing, contamination, of, canned, food, by, the, obligate, anaerobe, clostridium, botulinum, which, produces, an, acute, toxin, within, the, food, leading, to, severe, illness, or, death, this, organism, produces, no, gas, or, obvious, taste, and, remains, undetected, by, taste, or, smell, its, toxin, is, denatured, by, cooking, however, cooked, mushrooms, when, handled, poorly, and, then, canned, can, support, the, growth, of, staphylococcus, aureus, which, produces, a, toxin, that, is, not, destroyed, by, canning, or, subsequent, reheating, meat, can, be, preserved, by, salting, it, cooking, it, at, or, near, 100, c, 212, f, in, some, kind, of, fat, such, as, lard, or, tallow, and, then, storing, it, immersed, in, the, fat, these, preparations, were, popular, in, europe, before, refrigerators, became, ubiquitous, they, are, still, popular, in, france, where, the, term, originates, the, preparation, will, keep, longer, if, stored, in, a, cold, cellar, or, buried, in, cold, ground, cooling, preserves, food, by, slowing, down, the, growth, and, reproduction, of, microorganisms, and, the, action, of, enzymes, that, causes, the, food, to, rot, the, introduction, of, commercial, and, domestic, refrigerators, drastically, improved, the, diets, of, many, in, the, western, world, by, allowing, food, such, as, fresh, fruit, salads, and, dairy, products, to, be, stored, safely, for, longer, periods, particularly, during, warm, weather, before, the, era, of, mechanical, refrigeration, cooling, for, food, storage, occurred, in, the, forms, of, root, cellars, and, iceboxes, rural, people, often, did, their, own, ice, cutting, whereas, town, and, city, dwellers, often, relied, on, the, ice, trade, today, root, cellaring, remains, popular, among, people, who, value, various, goals, including, local, food, heirloom, crops, traditional, home, cooking, techniques, family, farming, frugality, self, sufficiency, organic, farming, and, others, the, earliest, form, of, curing, was, dehydration, or, drying, used, as, early, as, 12, 000, bc, smoking, and, salting, techniques, improve, on, the, drying, process, and, add, antimicrobial, agents, that, aid, in, preservation, smoke, deposits, a, number, of, pyrolysis, products, onto, the, food, including, the, phenols, syringol, guaiacol, and, catechol, salt, accelerates, the, drying, process, using, osmosis, and, also, inhibits, the, growth, of, several, common, strains, of, bacteria, more, recently, nitrites, have, been, used, to, cure, meat, contributing, a, characteristic, pink, colour, in, 2015, the, international, agency, for, research, on, cancer, of, the, world, health, organization, classified, processed, meat, i, e, meat, that, has, undergone, salting, curing, and, smoking, as, carcinogenic, to, humans, some, foods, such, as, many, cheeses, wines, and, beers, are, prepared, by, fermentation, this, involves, cultivating, specific, microorganisms, to, combat, spoilage, from, other, less, benign, organisms, these, microorganisms, keep, pathogens, in, check, by, producing, acid, or, alcohol, which, eventually, creates, an, environment, toxic, for, themselves, and, other, microorganisms, methods, of, fermentation, include, but, are, not, limited, to, starter, microorganisms, salt, hops, controlled, usually, cool, temperatures, and, controlled, usually, low, levels, of, oxygen, these, methods, are, used, to, create, the, specific, controlled, conditions, that, will, support, the, desirable, organisms, that, produce, food, fit, for, human, consumption, fermentation, is, the, microbial, conversion, of, starch, and, sugars, into, alcohol, not, only, can, fermentation, produce, alcohol, but, it, can, also, be, a, valuable, preservation, technique, fermentation, can, also, make, foods, more, nutritious, and, palatable, water, was, also, turned, into, alcoholic, beverages, through, fermentation, when, water, is, used, to, make, beer, the, boiling, during, the, brewing, process, may, kill, bacteria, that, could, make, people, sick, the, barley, and, other, ingredients, also, infuse, the, drink, with, nutrients, and, the, microorganisms, can, also, produce, vitamins, as, they, ferment, however, the, common, belief, that, premodern, people, avoided, drinking, ordinary, water, is, a, myth, while, people, avoided, drinking, dirty, or, polluted, water, they, also, avoided, using, it, for, the, production, of, beer, and, wine, water, was, visually, inspected, smelled, tasted, filtered, and, boiled, if, necessary, it, was, used, for, drinking, as, well, as, for, diluting, wine, cooking, and, many, other, processes, freezing, is, also, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, processes, both, commercially, and, domestically, for, preserving, a, very, wide, range, of, foods, including, prepared, foods, that, would, not, have, required, freezing, in, their, unprepared, state, for, example, potato, waffles, are, stored, in, the, freezer, but, potatoes, themselves, require, only, a, cool, dark, place, to, ensure, many, months, storage, cold, stores, provide, large, volume, long, term, storage, for, strategic, food, stocks, held, in, case, of, national, emergency, in, many, countries, heating, to, temperatures, which, are, sufficient, to, kill, microorganisms, inside, the, food, is, a, method, used, with, perpetual, stews, food, may, be, preserved, by, cooking, in, a, material, that, solidifies, to, form, a, gel, such, materials, include, gelatin, agar, maize, flour, and, arrowroot, flour, some, animal, flesh, forms, a, protein, gel, when, cooked, eels, and, elvers, and, sipunculid, worms, are, a, delicacy, in, xiamen, china, as, are, jellied, eels, in, the, east, end, of, london, where, they, are, eaten, with, mashed, potatoes, british, cuisine, has, a, rich, tradition, of, potted, meats, meat, off, cuts, were, until, the, 1950s, preserved, in, aspic, a, gel, made, from, gelatin, and, clarified, meat, broth, another, form, of, preservation, is, setting, the, cooked, food, in, a, container, and, covering, it, with, a, layer, of, fat, potted, chicken, liver, can, be, prepared, in, this, way, and, so, can, potted, shrimps, to, be, served, on, toast, calf, s, foot, jelly, used, to, be, prepared, for, invalids, jellying, is, one, of, the, steps, in, producing, traditional, p, t, s, many, jugged, meats, see, below, are, also, jellied, another, type, of, jellying, is, fruit, preserves, which, are, preparations, of, cooked, fruits, vegetables, and, sugar, often, stored, in, glass, jam, jars, and, mason, jars, many, varieties, of, fruit, preserves, are, made, globally, including, sweet, fruit, preserves, such, as, those, made, from, strawberry, or, apricot, and, savory, preserves, such, as, those, made, from, tomatoes, or, squash, the, ingredients, used, and, how, they, are, prepared, determine, the, type, of, preserves, jams, jellies, and, marmalades, are, all, examples, of, different, styles, of, fruit, preserves, that, vary, based, upon, the, fruit, used, in, english, the, word, preserves, in, plural, form, is, used, to, describe, all, types, of, jams, and, jellies, in, rural, afghanistan, grapes, are, preserved, in, disc, shaped, vessels, made, of, mud, and, straw, called, kangina, the, vessels, which, can, preserve, fresh, grapes, for, up, to, 6, months, passively, control, their, internal, environments, to, restrict, gas, exchange, and, water, loss, prolonging, the, lives, of, late, harvested, grapes, stored, within, them, meat, can, be, preserved, by, jugging, jugging, is, the, process, of, stewing, the, meat, commonly, game, or, fish, in, a, covered, earthenware, jug, or, casserole, the, animal, to, be, jugged, is, usually, cut, into, pieces, placed, into, a, tightly, sealed, jug, with, brine, or, gravy, and, stewed, red, wine, and, or, the, animal, s, own, blood, is, sometimes, added, to, the, cooking, liquid, jugging, was, a, popular, method, of, preserving, meat, up, until, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, sodium, hydroxide, lye, makes, food, too, alkaline, for, bacterial, growth, lye, will, saponify, fats, in, the, food, which, will, change, its, flavor, and, texture, lutefisk, uses, lye, in, its, preparation, as, do, some, olive, recipes, modern, recipes, for, century, eggs, also, call, for, lye, pickling, is, a, method, of, preserving, food, in, an, edible, antimicrobial, liquid, pickling, can, be, broadly, classified, into, two, categories, chemical, pickling, and, fermentation, pickling, in, chemical, pickling, the, food, is, placed, in, an, edible, liquid, that, inhibits, or, kills, bacteria, and, other, microorganisms, typical, pickling, agents, include, brine, high, in, salt, vinegar, alcohol, and, vegetable, oil, many, chemical, pickling, processes, also, involve, heating, or, boiling, so, that, the, food, being, preserved, becomes, saturated, with, the, pickling, agent, common, chemically, pickled, foods, include, cucumbers, peppers, corned, beef, herring, and, eggs, as, well, as, mixed, vegetables, such, as, piccalilli, in, fermentation, pickling, bacteria, in, the, liquid, produce, organic, acids, as, preservation, agents, typically, by, a, process, that, produces, lactic, acid, through, the, presence, of, lactobacillales, fermented, pickles, include, sauerkraut, nukazuke, kimchi, and, surstr, mming, the, earliest, cultures, have, used, sugar, as, a, preservative, and, it, was, commonplace, to, store, fruit, in, honey, similar, to, pickled, foods, sugar, cane, was, brought, to, europe, through, the, trade, routes, in, northern, climates, without, sufficient, sun, to, dry, foods, preserves, are, made, by, heating, the, fruit, with, sugar, sugar, tends, to, draw, water, from, the, microbes, plasmolysis, this, process, leaves, the, microbial, cells, dehydrated, thus, killing, them, in, this, way, the, food, will, remain, safe, from, microbial, spoilage, sugar, is, used, to, preserve, fruits, either, in, an, antimicrobial, syrup, with, fruit, such, as, apples, pears, peaches, apricots, and, plums, or, in, crystallized, form, where, the, preserved, material, is, cooked, in, sugar, to, the, point, of, crystallization, and, the, resultant, product, is, then, stored, dry, this, method, is, used, for, the, skins, of, citrus, fruit, candied, peel, angelica, and, ginger, sugaring, can, be, used, in, the, production, of, jam, and, jelly, techniques, of, food, preservation, were, developed, in, research, laboratories, for, commercial, applications, aseptic, processing, works, by, placing, sterilized, food, typically, by, heat, see, ultra, high, temperature, processing, into, sterlized, packaging, material, under, sterile, conditions, the, result, is, a, sealed, sterile, food, product, similar, to, canned, food, but, depending, on, the, technique, used, damage, to, food, quality, is, typically, reduced, compared, to, canned, food, a, greater, variety, of, packaging, materials, can, be, used, as, well, besides, uht, aseptic, processing, may, be, used, in, conjunction, with, any, of, the, microbe, reduction, technologies, listed, below, with, pasteurization, and, high, pressure, pasteurization, the, food, may, not, be, completely, sterilized, instead, achieving, a, specified, log, reduction, but, the, use, of, sterile, packaging, and, environments, is, retained, pasteurization, is, a, process, for, preservation, of, liquid, food, it, was, originally, applied, to, combat, the, souring, of, young, local, wines, today, the, process, is, mainly, applied, to, dairy, products, in, this, method, milk, is, heated, at, about, 70, c, 158, f, for, 15, 30, seconds, to, kill, the, bacteria, present, in, it, and, cooling, it, quickly, to, 10, c, 50, f, to, prevent, the, remaining, bacteria, from, growing, the, milk, is, then, stored, in, sterilized, bottles, or, pouches, in, cold, places, this, method, was, invented, by, louis, pasteur, a, french, chemist, in, 1862, vacuum, packing, stores, food, in, a, vacuum, environment, usually, in, an, air, tight, bag, or, bottle, the, vacuum, environment, strips, bacteria, of, oxygen, needed, for, survival, vacuum, packing, is, commonly, used, for, storing, nuts, to, reduce, loss, of, flavor, from, oxidization, a, major, drawback, to, vacuum, packaging, at, the, consumer, level, is, that, vacuum, sealing, can, deform, contents, and, rob, certain, foods, such, as, cheese, of, its, flavor, freeze, drying, also, known, as, lyophilization, or, cryodesiccation, is, a, low, temperature, dehydration, process, that, involves, freezing, the, product, and, lowering, pressure, thereby, removing, the, ice, by, sublimation, this, is, in, contrast, to, dehydration, by, most, conventional, methods, that, evaporate, water, using, heat, preservative, food, additives, can, be, antimicrobial, which, inhibit, the, growth, of, bacteria, or, fungi, including, mold, or, antioxidant, such, as, oxygen, absorbers, which, inhibit, the, oxidation, of, food, constituents, common, antimicrobial, preservatives, include, nisin, sorbates, calcium, propionate, sodium, nitrate, nitrite, sulfites, sulfur, dioxide, sodium, bisulfite, potassium, hydrogen, sulfite, etc, edta, hinokitiol, and, polylysine, antioxidants, include, tocopherols, vitamin, e, butylated, hydroxyanisole, bha, and, butylated, hydroxytoluene, bht, other, preservatives, include, ethanol, there, is, also, another, approach, of, impregnating, packaging, materials, plastic, films, or, other, with, antioxidants, and, antimicrobials, irradiation, of, food, is, the, exposure, of, food, to, ionizing, radiation, multiple, types, of, ionizing, radiation, can, be, used, including, beta, particles, high, energy, electrons, and, gamma, rays, emitted, from, radioactive, sources, such, as, cobalt, 60, or, cesium, 137, irradiation, can, kill, bacteria, molds, and, insect, pests, reduce, the, ripening, and, spoiling, of, fruits, and, at, higher, doses, induce, sterility, the, technology, may, be, compared, to, pasteurization, it, is, sometimes, called, cold, pasteurization, as, the, product, is, not, heated, irradiation, may, allow, lower, quality, or, contaminated, foods, to, be, rendered, marketable, national, and, international, expert, bodies, have, declared, food, irradiation, as, wholesome, organizations, of, the, united, nations, such, as, the, world, health, organization, and, food, and, agriculture, organization, endorse, food, irradiation, consumers, may, have, a, negative, view, of, irradiated, food, based, on, the, misconception, that, such, food, is, radioactive, in, fact, irradiated, food, does, not, and, cannot, become, radioactive, activists, have, also, opposed, food, irradiation, for, other, reasons, for, example, arguing, that, irradiation, can, be, used, to, sterilize, contaminated, food, without, resolving, the, underlying, cause, of, the, contamination, international, legislation, on, whether, food, may, be, irradiated, or, not, varies, worldwide, from, no, regulation, to, a, full, ban, approximately, 500, 000, tons, of, food, items, are, irradiated, per, year, worldwide, in, over, 40, countries, these, are, mainly, spices, and, condiments, with, an, increasing, segment, of, fresh, fruit, irradiated, for, fruit, fly, quarantine, pulsed, electric, field, pef, electroporation, is, a, method, for, processing, cells, by, means, of, brief, pulses, of, a, strong, electric, field, pef, holds, potential, as, a, type, of, low, temperature, alternative, pasteurization, process, for, sterilizing, food, products, in, pef, processing, a, substance, is, placed, between, two, electrodes, then, the, pulsed, electric, field, is, applied, the, electric, field, enlarges, the, pores, of, the, cell, membranes, which, kills, the, cells, and, releases, their, contents, pef, for, food, processing, is, a, developing, technology, still, being, researched, there, have, been, limited, industrial, applications, of, pef, processing, for, the, pasteurization, of, fruit, juices, to, date, several, pef, treated, juices, are, available, on, the, market, in, europe, furthermore, for, several, years, a, juice, pasteurization, application, in, the, us, has, used, pef, for, cell, disintegration, purposes, especially, potato, processors, show, great, interest, in, pef, technology, as, an, efficient, alternative, for, their, preheaters, potato, applications, are, already, operational, in, the, us, and, canada, there, are, also, commercial, pef, potato, applications, in, various, countries, in, europe, as, well, as, in, australia, india, and, china, modifying, atmosphere, is, a, way, to, preserve, food, by, operating, on, the, atmosphere, around, it, it, is, often, used, to, package, this, process, subjects, the, surface, of, food, to, a, flame, of, ionized, gas, molecules, such, as, helium, or, nitrogen, this, causes, micro, organisms, to, die, off, on, the, surface, high, pressure, can, be, used, to, disable, harmful, microorganisms, and, spoilage, enzymes, while, retaining, the, food, s, fresh, appearance, flavor, texture, and, nutrients, by, 2005, the, process, was, being, used, for, products, ranging, from, orange, juice, to, guacamole, to, deli, meats, and, widely, sold, depending, on, temperature, and, pressure, settings, hp, processing, can, achieve, either, pasteurization, equivalent, log, reduction, or, go, all, the, way, to, achieve, sterilization, of, all, microbes, biopreservation, is, the, use, of, natural, or, controlled, microbiota, or, antimicrobials, as, a, way, of, preserving, food, and, extending, its, shelf, life, beneficial, bacteria, or, the, fermentation, products, produced, by, these, bacteria, are, used, in, biopreservation, to, control, spoilage, and, render, pathogens, inactive, in, food, it, is, a, benign, ecological, approach, which, is, gaining, increasing, attention, lactic, acid, bacteria, lab, have, antagonistic, properties, that, make, them, particularly, useful, as, biopreservatives, when, labs, compete, for, nutrients, their, metabolites, often, include, active, antimicrobials, such, as, lactic, acid, acetic, acid, hydrogen, peroxide, and, peptide, bacteriocins, some, labs, produce, the, antimicrobial, nisin, which, is, a, particularly, effective, preservative, lab, bacteriocins, are, used, in, the, present, day, as, an, integral, part, of, hurdle, technology, using, them, in, combination, with, other, preservative, techniques, can, effectively, control, spoilage, bacteria, and, other, pathogens, and, can, inhibit, the, activities, of, a, wide, spectrum, of, organisms, including, inherently, resistant, gram, negative, bacteria, hurdle, technology, is, a, method, of, ensuring, that, pathogens, in, food, products, can, be, eliminated, or, controlled, by, combining, more, than, one, approach, these, approaches, can, be, thought, of, as, hurdles, the, pathogen, has, to, overcome, if, it, is, to, remain, active, in, the, food, the, right, combination, of, hurdles, can, ensure, all, pathogens, are, eliminated, or, rendered, harmless, in, the, final, product, hurdle, technology, has, been, defined, by, leistner, 2000, as, an, intelligent, combination, of, hurdles, that, secures, the, microbial, safety, and, stability, as, well, as, the, organoleptic, and, nutritional, quality, and, the, economic, viability, of, food, products, the, organoleptic, quality, of, the, food, refers, to, its, sensory, properties, that, is, its, look, taste, smell, and, texture, examples, of, hurdles, in, a, food, system, are, high, temperature, during, processing, low, temperature, during, storage, increasing, the, acidity, lowering, the, water, activity, or, redox, potential, and, the, presence, of, preservatives, or, biopreservatives, according, to, the, type, of, pathogens, and, how, risky, they, are, the, intensity, of, the, hurdles, can, be, adjusted, individually, to, meet, consumer, preferences, in, an, economical, way, without, sacrificing, the, safety, of, the, product
