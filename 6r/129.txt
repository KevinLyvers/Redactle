soy, sauce, sometimes, called, soya, sauce, in, british, english, is, a, liquid, condiment, of, chinese, origin, traditionally, made, from, a, fermented, paste, of, soybeans, roasted, grain, brine, and, aspergillus, oryzae, or, aspergillus, sojae, molds, it, is, recognized, for, its, saltiness, and, pronounced, umami, taste, soy, sauce, was, created, in, its, current, form, about, 2, 200, years, ago, during, the, western, han, dynasty, of, ancient, china, since, then, it, has, become, an, important, ingredient, in, east, and, southeast, asian, cooking, as, well, as, a, condiment, worldwide, soy, sauce, can, be, added, directly, to, food, and, is, used, as, a, dip, or, salt, flavor, in, cooking, it, is, often, eaten, with, rice, noodles, and, sushi, or, sashimi, or, can, also, be, mixed, with, ground, wasabi, for, dipping, bottles, of, soy, sauce, for, the, salty, seasoning, of, various, foods, are, common, on, restaurant, tables, in, many, countries, soy, sauce, can, be, stored, at, room, temperature, soy, sauce, ji, ngy, u, is, considered, almost, as, old, as, soy, paste, a, type, of, fermented, paste, jiang, obtained, from, soybeans, which, had, appeared, during, the, western, han, dynasty, 206, bc, 220, ad, and, was, listed, in, the, bamboo, slips, found, in, the, archaeological, site, mawangdui, there, are, several, precursors, of, soy, sauce, that, are, associated, products, with, soy, paste, the, oldest, is, qingjiang, which, appeared, in, ad, 40, and, was, listed, in, simin, yueling, others, are, jiangqing, chizhi, and, chiqing, which, were, recorded, in, the, qimin, yaoshu, in, ad, 540, by, the, time, of, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, ad, the, term, soy, sauce, had, become, the, accepted, name, for, the, liquid, condiment, documented, in, two, books, shanjia, qinggong, and, pujiang, wushi, zhongkuilu, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, ad, like, many, salty, condiments, soy, sauce, was, originally, a, way, to, stretch, salt, historically, an, expensive, commodity, during, the, zhou, dynasty, of, ancient, china, fermented, fish, with, salt, was, used, as, a, condiment, in, which, soybeans, were, included, during, the, fermentation, process, by, the, time, of, the, han, dynasty, this, had, been, replaced, with, the, recipe, for, soy, paste, and, its, by, product, soy, sauce, by, using, soybeans, as, the, principal, ingredient, with, fermented, fish, based, sauces, developing, separately, into, fish, sauce, the, 19th, century, sinologist, samuel, wells, williams, wrote, that, in, china, the, best, soy, sauce, was, made, by, boiling, beans, soft, adding, an, equal, quantity, of, wheat, or, barley, and, leaving, the, mass, to, ferment, a, portion, of, salt, and, three, times, as, much, water, are, afterwards, put, in, and, the, whole, compound, left, for, two, or, three, months, when, the, liquid, is, pressed, and, strained, a, condiment, that, predated, soy, sauce, in, japan, was, gyosh, a, fish, sauce, when, practitioners, of, buddhism, came, to, japan, from, china, in, the, 7th, century, they, introduced, vegetarianism, and, brought, many, soy, based, products, with, them, such, as, soy, sauce, which, is, known, as, sh, yu, in, japan, shoyu, exportation, began, in, 1647, by, the, dutch, east, india, company, the, earliest, soy, sauce, brewing, in, korea, seems, to, have, begun, in, the, era, of, the, three, kingdoms, the, records, of, the, three, kingdoms, a, chinese, historical, text, written, and, published, in, the, 3rd, century, mentions, that, goguryeo, people, are, good, at, brewing, and, fermenting, in, the, section, named, dongyi, eastern, foreigners, in, the, book, of, wei, jangdoks, used, for, soy, sauce, brewing, are, found, in, the, mural, paintings, of, anak, tomb, no, 3, from, the, 4th, century, goguryeo, in, samguk, sagi, a, historical, record, of, the, three, kingdoms, era, it, is, written, that, ganjang, soy, sauce, and, doenjang, soybean, paste, along, with, meju, soybean, block, and, jeotgal, salted, seafood, were, prepared, for, the, wedding, ceremony, of, the, king, sinmun, in, february, 683, sikhwaji, a, section, from, goryeosa, history, of, goryeo, recorded, that, ganjang, and, doenjang, were, included, in, the, relief, supplies, in, 1018, after, a, khitan, invasion, and, in, 1052, when, a, famine, occurred, joseon, texts, such, as, guhwangchwaryo, and, jeungbo, sallim, gyeongje, contain, the, detailed, procedures, on, how, to, brew, good, quality, ganjang, and, doenjang, gyuhap, chongseo, explains, how, to, pick, a, date, for, brewing, what, to, forbear, and, how, to, keep, and, preserve, ganjang, and, doenjang, in, the, philippines, soy, sauce, was, likely, first, recorded, through, the, documentation, of, the, traditional, dish, adobo, in, 1613, via, the, san, buenaventura, paper, food, historian, raymond, sokolov, noted, that, the, ingredients, used, in, the, dish, including, soy, sauce, likely, were, present, in, the, native, cuisine, even, before, the, colonial, era, record, records, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, list, soy, sauce, as, a, commodity, in, 1737, when, seventy, five, large, barrels, were, shipped, from, dejima, japan, to, batavia, present, day, jakarta, on, the, island, of, java, thirty, five, barrels, from, that, shipment, were, then, shipped, to, the, netherlands, in, the, 18th, century, diplomat, and, scholar, isaac, titsingh, published, accounts, of, brewing, soy, sauce, although, earlier, descriptions, of, soy, sauce, had, been, disseminated, in, the, west, his, was, among, the, earliest, to, focus, specifically, on, the, brewing, of, the, japanese, version, by, the, mid, 19th, century, japanese, soy, sauce, gradually, disappeared, from, the, european, market, and, the, condiment, became, synonymous, with, the, chinese, product, europeans, were, unable, to, make, soy, sauce, because, they, did, not, have, access, to, aspergillus, oryzae, the, fungus, used, in, its, brewing, soy, sauce, made, from, ingredients, such, as, portobello, mushrooms, were, disseminated, in, european, cookbooks, during, the, late, 18th, century, a, swedish, recipe, for, soija, was, published, in, the, 1770, edition, of, cajsa, warg, s, hjelpreda, i, hush, llningen, f, r, unga, fruentimber, and, was, flavored, with, allspice, and, mace, soy, sauce, production, in, the, united, states, began, in, the, territory, of, hawaii, in, 1905, by, yamajo, soy, co, which, by, 1909, was, renamed, the, hawaiian, soy, company, ltd, la, choy, started, selling, hydrolyzed, vegetable, protein, based, soy, sauce, in, 1933, soy, sauce, is, made, either, by, fermentation, or, by, hydrolysis, some, commercial, sauces, have, both, fermented, and, chemical, sauces, flavor, color, and, aroma, developments, during, production, are, attributed, to, non, enzymatic, maillard, browning, variation, is, usually, achieved, as, the, result, of, different, methods, and, durations, of, fermentation, different, ratios, of, water, salt, and, fermented, soy, or, through, the, addition, of, other, ingredients, traditional, soy, sauces, are, made, by, mixing, soybeans, and, grain, with, mold, cultures, such, as, aspergillus, oryzae, and, other, related, microorganisms, and, yeasts, the, resulting, mixture, is, called, koji, in, japan, the, term, koji, is, used, both, for, the, mixture, of, soybeans, wheat, and, mold, as, well, as, for, the, mold, itself, historically, the, mixture, was, fermented, naturally, in, large, urns, and, under, the, sun, which, was, believed, to, contribute, extra, flavors, today, the, mixture, is, placed, in, a, temperature, and, humidity, controlled, incubation, chamber, traditional, soy, sauces, take, months, to, make, high, salt, liquid, state, fermentation, hlf, of, soybeans, depends, heavily, on, microbial, activity, metabolism, and, enzymatic, hydrolysis, of, macronutrients, most, traditional, approaches, fall, into, the, scope, of, hlf, lsf, also, referred, as, rapid, fermenting, is, a, modern, fermentation, method, invented, in, response, to, high, market, demand, lsf, evolved, from, salt, free, solid, state, fermentation, an, even, faster, method, working, at, even, higher, temperatures, 50, 65, c, 122, 149, f, and, taking, 72, hours, to, complete, introduced, to, china, from, the, soviet, union, in, 1958, the, aging, time, turned, out, to, be, too, short, develop, a, proper, flavor, profile, with, burnt, acidic, notes, left, in, the, sauce, lsf, is, a, compromise, between, this, method, and, the, more, traditional, hlf, the, product, tastes, passable, with, more, microbes, allowed, to, survive, but, still, lacks, depth, reducing, the, salt, content, accelerates, brewing, by, lifting, salt, induced, enzyme, inhibition, some, brands, of, soy, sauce, are, made, from, acid, hydrolyzed, soy, protein, instead, of, brewed, with, a, traditional, culture, this, takes, about, three, days, although, they, have, a, different, flavor, aroma, and, texture, when, compared, to, brewed, soy, sauces, they, can, be, produced, more, quickly, and, cheaply, and, also, have, a, longer, shelf, life, and, are, usually, made, for, these, reasons, the, clear, plastic, packets, of, dark, sauce, common, with, chinese, style, take, out, food, typically, use, a, hydrolyzed, vegetable, protein, formula, some, higher, priced, hydrolyzed, vegetable, protein, products, with, no, added, sugar, or, colorings, are, sold, as, low, sodium, soy, sauce, alternatives, called, liquid, aminos, in, health, food, stores, similar, to, the, way, salt, substitutes, are, used, these, products, are, however, not, necessarily, low, in, sodium, the, chemical, composition, of, soy, sauce, is, affected, by, the, proportions, of, raw, materials, fermentation, methodologies, fermenting, molds, and, strains, and, post, fermentation, treatments, although, the, formation, mechanism, of, chemical, composition, in, soy, sauce, is, complex, it, has, been, widely, accepted, that, free, amino, acids, water, soluble, peptides, and, maillard, reaction, products, in, soy, sauce, are, considered, as, essential, chemical, composition, and, to, provide, core, sensory, effects, the, primary, fermentation, of, lactic, acid, fermenting, halophiles, lowers, the, ph, of, the, moromi, and, this, directly, results, in, the, acidic, ph, range, 4, 4, 5, 4, of, soy, sauce, products, the, secondary, fermentation, conducted, by, heterofermentative, microbes, provides, soy, sauce, with, a, wide, range, of, flavor, and, odorant, compounds, by, breaking, down, macronutrients, soy, proteins, and, grain, proteins, are, hydrolyzed, into, short, peptide, chains, and, free, amino, acids, which, adds, umami, to, the, product, based, on, the, result, of, free, amino, acid, analysis, the, most, abundant, amino, acids, in, chinese, soy, sauce, product, are, glutamic, acid, aspartic, acid, alanine, and, leucine, starch, is, hydrolyzed, into, simple, sugars, which, contribute, to, the, sweet, flavor, in, soy, sauce, legume, fats, may, also, be, decomposed, into, short, chain, fatty, acids, and, the, interactions, among, lipids, and, other, macronutrients, also, result, in, a, richer, flavor, in, the, final, product, non, enzymatic, browning, also, contributes, significantly, to, the, development, of, the, properties, of, soy, sauce, the, hydrolysis, of, proteins, and, large, carbohydrates, also, provides, free, amino, acids, and, simple, sugars, as, reagents, for, the, maillard, reaction, soy, sauce, may, contain, more, than, 1, alcohol, and, may, run, afoul, of, liquor, control, legislation, the, taste, of, soy, sauce, is, predominated, by, saltiness, followed, by, moderate, umami, sweetness, and, finally, slight, bitterness, which, is, hard, to, perceive, due, to, the, masking, effect, of, other, tastes, the, overall, flavor, of, soy, sauce, is, a, result, of, the, balance, and, interaction, among, different, taste, components, the, saltiness, is, largely, attributed, to, the, presence, of, nacl, common, salt, in, brine, the, sugars, hydrolyzed, from, starch, add, sweetness, into, soy, sauce, umami, is, largely, caused, by, the, presence, of, free, amino, acids, mainly, glutamine, and, aspartic, acid, sodium, from, the, brine, and, disodium, ribonucleotides, from, the, soy, also, add, to, the, umami, other, amino, acids, cause, additional, basic, flavors, with, sweet, coming, from, ala, gly, ser, and, thr, bitter, coming, from, arg, his, ile, leu, met, phe, trp, tyr, and, val, and, no, taste, from, cys, lys, and, pro, the, amino, acid, nitrogen, content, an, indication, of, the, free, amino, acid, concentration, is, used, in, china, for, grading, soy, sauce, the, highest, special, grade, is, defined, at, 0, 8, g, 100, ml, despite, a, large, variety, of, volatile, and, odorant, compounds, that, have, been, identified, in, soy, sauce, the, food, product, per, se, does, not, present, a, strong, aroma, alcohols, acids, esters, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, heterocyclic, compounds, alkynes, and, benzenes, have, been, identified, in, chinese, soy, sauces, an, explanation, for, this, observation, is, that, the, aroma, of, soy, sauce, does, not, depend, largely, on, the, aroma, active, compounds, the, subtle, aroma, is, a, result, of, a, critical, balance, achieved, among, all, volatile, and, odorant, compounds, whose, respective, concentrations, are, relatively, low, soy, sauce, is, widely, used, as, an, important, flavoring, and, has, been, integrated, into, the, traditional, cuisines, of, many, east, asian, and, southeast, asian, cultures, despite, their, rather, similar, appearance, soy, sauces, made, in, different, cultures, and, regions, are, different, in, taste, consistency, fragrance, and, saltiness, soy, sauce, retains, its, quality, longer, when, kept, away, from, direct, sunlight, burmese, soy, sauce, production, is, dated, back, to, the, bagan, era, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, century, scripts, written, in, praise, of, pe, ngan, byar, yay, literally, bean, fish, sauce, were, found, thick, soy, sauce, is, called, kya, nyo, from, chinese, ji, ngy, u, chinese, soy, sauces, chinese, pinyin, ji, ng, y, u, jyutping, zoeng3, jau4, cantonese, yale, jeungy, uh, or, alternatively, pinyin, ch, y, u, jyutping, si6jau4, cantonese, yale, sihy, uh, are, primarily, made, from, soybeans, with, relatively, low, amounts, of, other, grains, chinese, soy, sauce, produced, by, fermentation, can, be, roughly, split, into, two, classes, brewed, direct, fermented, or, blended, with, additives, occupying, about, 40, and, 60, of, market, share, respectively, sauces, can, also, be, classed, by, fermentation, technology, shown, above, into, low, salt, solid, state, fermented, soy, sauce, lsf, and, high, salt, liquid, state, fermented, soy, sauce, hlf, occupying, about, 90, and, 10, of, market, share, respectively, soy, sauce, can, be, brewed, directly, from, a, fermentation, process, using, wheat, soybeans, salt, and, water, without, additional, additives, additives, with, sweet, or, umami, tastes, are, sometimes, added, to, a, finished, brewed, soy, sauce, to, modify, its, taste, and, texture, besides, the, above, traditional, types, hydrolyzed, vegetable, protein, and, other, flavor, enhancers, may, be, mixed, with, brewed, soy, sauce, to, produce, cheaper, substitutes, this, type, is, known, as, blended, soy, sauce, chinese, in, china, until, 2019, when, a, chinese, 2018, standard, that, removed, this, type, from, the, definition, of, soy, sauce, went, into, effect, the, 2018, chinese, standard, defines, soy, sauce, as, liquid, condiments, with, special, color, aroma, and, taste, made, from, soybeans, and, or, defatted, soybeans, wheat, and, or, wheat, flour, and, or, wheat, bran, as, main, raw, materials, through, microbial, fermentation, it, still, allows, food, additives, to, be, used, following, the, definitions, of, gb, 2760, which, does, not, restrict, the, use, of, msg, and, disodium, ribonucleotides, hydrolyzed, vegetable, protein, is, not, listed, as, a, food, additive, in, gb, 2760, and, is, therefore, unacceptable, in, products, labelled, as, soy, sauce, in, the, philippines, soy, sauce, is, called, toy, in, the, native, languages, derived, from, tau, yu, in, philippine, hokkien, philippine, soy, sauce, is, usually, a, combination, of, soybeans, wheat, salt, and, caramel, color, it, is, thinner, in, texture, and, has, a, saltier, taste, than, its, southeast, asian, counterparts, it, is, most, similar, to, the, japanese, koikuchi, sh, yu, in, terms, of, consistency, and, the, use, of, wheat, though, toy, is, a, bit, saltier, and, darker, in, color, toy, is, used, as, a, marinade, an, ingredient, in, cooked, dishes, and, most, often, as, a, table, condiment, usually, alongside, other, sauces, such, as, fish, sauce, pat, s, and, sugar, cane, vinegar, suk, it, is, often, mixed, and, served, with, the, juice, of, the, calamansi, citrofortunella, microcarpa, also, called, calamondin, limonsito, the, combination, is, known, as, toyomans, which, can, be, comparable, to, the, japanese, ponzu, sauce, soy, sauce, with, yuzu, toy, is, also, a, main, ingredient, in, philippine, adobo, one, of, the, more, famous, dishes, of, filipino, cuisine, soy, sauce, is, a, ubiquitous, condiment, and, ingredient, in, many, dishes, in, hawaiian, cuisine, where, it, is, commonly, known, by, its, japanese, name, sh, yu, by, locals, aloha, shoyu, is, a, soy, sauce, manufacturer, in, hawaii, that, produces, a, popular, soy, sauce, whose, flavor, is, more, delicate, and, somewhat, sweeter, compared, to, other, more, well, known, soy, sauces, in, indonesia, soy, sauce, is, known, as, kecap, old, spelling, ketjap, which, is, a, catch, all, term, for, fermented, sauces, and, cognate, to, the, english, word, ketchup, the, most, popular, type, of, soy, sauce, in, indonesian, cuisine, is, kecap, manis, or, sweet, soy, sauce, the, term, kecap, is, also, used, to, describe, other, condiments, and, sauces, of, a, similar, appearance, such, as, kecap, ikan, fish, sauce, and, kecap, inggris, worcestershire, sauce, lit, english, sauce, or, england, sauce, three, common, varieties, of, soy, based, kecap, exist, in, indonesian, cuisine, used, either, as, ingredients, or, condiments, sh, yu, is, officially, divided, into, five, main, types, by, the, jas, japanese, agricultural, standard, depending, on, differences, in, their, ingredients, and, method, of, production, these, types, are, koikuchi, usukuchi, tamari, saishikomi, and, shiro, most, but, not, all, japanese, soy, sauces, include, wheat, as, a, primary, ingredient, which, tends, to, give, them, a, slightly, sweeter, taste, than, their, chinese, counterparts, they, also, tend, towards, an, alcoholic, sherry, like, flavor, sometimes, enhanced, by, the, addition, of, small, amounts, of, alcohol, as, a, natural, preservative, the, widely, varying, flavors, of, these, soy, sauces, are, not, always, interchangeable, so, some, recipes, only, call, for, one, type, or, the, other, much, as, a, white, wine, cannot, replace, a, red, s, flavor, or, beef, stock, does, not, make, the, same, results, as, fish, stock, some, soy, sauces, made, in, the, japanese, way, or, styled, after, them, contain, about, 50, wheat, newer, varieties, of, japanese, soy, sauce, include, all, of, these, varieties, are, sold, in, three, different, grades, according, to, how, they, were, made, all, the, varieties, and, grades, may, be, sold, according, to, three, official, levels, of, quality, in, south, korea, soy, sauces, or, ganjang, seasoning, sauce, can, be, roughly, split, into, two, categories, hansik, ganjang, korean, style, soy, sauce, and, gaeryang, ganjang, modernized, soy, sauce, the, term, ganjang, can, also, refer, to, non, soy, based, salty, condiments, such, as, eo, ganjang, fish, sauce, hansik, ganjang, korean, style, soy, sauce, is, made, entirely, of, fermented, soybean, meju, and, brine, it, is, a, byproduct, of, doenjang, fermented, soybean, paste, production, and, has, a, unique, fermented, soybean, flavour, both, lighter, in, colour, and, saltier, than, other, korean, ganjang, varieties, hansik, ganjang, is, used, mainly, in, guk, soup, and, namul, seasoned, vegetable, dish, in, modern, korean, cuisine, common, names, for, hansik, ganjang, include, jaeraesik, ganjang, traditional,

hansik, ganjang, can, be, divided, into, three, main, varieties, clear, middle, and, dark, korean, ministry, of, food, and, drug, safety, s, food, code, classifies, hansik, ganjang, into, two, categories, by, their, ingredients, gaeryang, ganjang, modernized, soy, sauce, referring, to, varieties, of, soy, sauces, not, made, of, meju, is, now, the, most, widely, used, type, of, soy, sauce, in, modern, korean, cuisine, the, word, ganjang, without, modifiers, in, bokkeum, stir, fry, jorim, braised, or, simmered, dishes, and, jjim, steamed, dishes, recipes, usually, mean, gaeryang, ganjang, another, common, name, of, gaeryang, ganjang, is, jin, ganjang, dark, soy, sauce, because, gaeryang, ganjang, varieties, are, usually, darker, in, appearance, compared, to, traditional, hansik, ganjang, having, been, introduced, to, korea, during, the, era, of, japanese, forced, occupation, garyang, ganjang, is, also, called, wae, ganjang, wae, soy, sauce, korean, ministry, of, food,
