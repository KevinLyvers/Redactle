disc, games, the, shape, of, the, disc, is, an, airfoil, in, cross, section, which, allows, it, to, fly, by, reducing, the, drag, and, increasing, lift, as, it, moves, through, the, air, compared, to, a, flat, plate, spinning, the, disc, imparts, a, stabilizing, gyroscopic, force, allowing, it, to, be, both, aimed, with, accuracy, and, thrown, for, distance, a, wide, range, is, available, of, flying, disc, variants, those, for, disc, golf, are, usually, smaller, but, denser, compared, to, ultimate, frisbee, and, tailored, for, particular, flight, profiles, to, increase, or, decrease, stability, and, distance, the, longest, recorded, disc, throw, is, by, david, wiggins, jr, with, a, distance, of, 338, metres, 1, 109, ft, disc, dog, sports, use, relatively, slow, flying, discs, made, of, more, pliable, material, to, better, resist, a, dog, s, bite, and, prevent, injury, to, the, dog, flying, rings, are, also, available, which, typically, travel, significantly, farther, than, any, traditional, flying, disc, illuminated, discs, are, made, of, phosphorescent, plastic, or, contain, chemiluminescent, fluid, or, battery, powered, leds, for, play, after, dark, others, whistle, when, they, reach, a, certain, velocity, in, flight, the, term, frisbee, is, often, used, generically, to, describe, all, flying, discs, but, frisbee, is, a, registered, trademark, of, the, wham, o, toy, company, this, protection, results, in, organized, sports, such, as, ultimate, or, disc, golf, having, to, forgo, use, of, the, word, frisbee, frisbees, were, invented, in, the, late, 1930s, by, the, american, inventor, walter, frederick, morrison, morrison, and, his, future, wife, lucile, had, fun, tossing, a, popcorn, can, lid, after, a, thanksgiving, day, dinner, in, 1937, they, soon, discovered, a, market, for, a, light, duty, flying, disc, when, they, were, offered, 25, cents, equivalent, to, 5, in, 2023, for, a, cake, pan, that, they, were, tossing, back, and, forth, on, a, beach, near, los, angeles, in, 2007, in, an, interview, in, the, virginian, pilot, newspaper, morrison, compared, that, with, the, 5, cents, equivalent, to, 1, in, 2023, it, cost, at, the, time, that, got, the, wheels, turning, because, you, could, buy, a, cake, pan, for, five, cents, and, if, people, on, the, beach, were, willing, to, pay, a, quarter, for, it, well, there, was, a, business, the, morrisons, continued, their, business, until, world, war, ii, when, walter, served, in, the, army, air, force, flying, p, 47s, and, then, was, a, prisoner, of, war, after, the, war, morrison, sketched, a, design, for, an, aerodynamically, improved, flying, disc, that, he, called, the, whirlo, way, after, the, famous, racehorse, he, and, business, partner, warren, franscioni, began, producing, the, first, plastic, discs, by, 1948, after, design, modifications, and, experimentation, with, several, prototypes, they, renamed, them, the, flyin, saucer, in, the, wake, of, reported, unidentified, flying, object, sightings, we, worked, fairs, demonstrating, it, morrison, told, the, virginian, pilot, the, two, of, them, once, overheard, someone, saying, that, the, pair, were, using, wires, to, make, the, discs, hover, so, they, developed, a, sales, pitch, the, flyin, saucer, is, free, but, the, invisible, wire, is, 1, equivalent, to, 13, in, 2023, that, s, where, we, learned, we, could, sell, these, things, he, said, because, people, were, enthusiastic, about, them, morrison, and, franscioni, ended, their, partnership, in, early, 1950, and, morrison, formed, his, own, company, in, 1954, called, american, trends, to, buy, and, sell, flyin, saucers, no, hyphen, after, 1953, which, were, being, made, of, a, flexible, polypropylene, plastic, by, southern, california, plastics, the, original, molder, he, discovered, that, he, could, produce, his, own, disc, more, cheaply, and, he, designed, a, new, model, in, 1955, called, the, pluto, platter, the, archetype, of, all, modern, flying, discs, he, sold, the, rights, to, wham, o, on, january, 23, 1957, in, june, 1957, wham, o, co, founders, richard, knerr, and, arthur, spud, melin, gave, the, disc, the, brand, name, frisbee, after, learning, that, college, students, were, calling, the, pluto, platter, by, that, term, which, was, derived, from, the, connecticut, based, pie, manufacturer, frisbie, pie, company, a, supplier, of, pies, to, yale, university, where, students, had, started, a, campus, craze, tossing, empty, pie, tins, stamped, with, the, company, s, logo, the, way, that, morrison, and, his, wife, had, in, 1937, in, november, 1957, the, frisbee, was, featured, in, what, may, be, the, first, rock, musical, ever, performed, anything, everything, written, by, ted, nelson, the,

by, reworking, the, mold, mainly, to, remove, the, names, of, the, planets, but, fortuitously, increasing, the, rim, thickness, and, mass, in, the, process, creating, a, more, controllable, disc, that, could, be, thrown, more, accurately, wham, o, changed, their, marketing, strategy, to, promote, frisbee, use, as, a, new, sport, and, sales, increased, in, 1964, the, first, professional, model, went, on, sale, headrick, patented, its, design, it, featured, raised, ridges, the, rings, of, headrick, that, were, claimed, to, stabilize, flight, headrick, became, known, as, the, father, of, frisbee, sports, he, founded, the, international, frisbee, association, and, appointed, dan, roddick, as, its, head, roddick, began, establishing, north, american, series, nas, tournament, standards, for, various, frisbee, sports, such, as, freestyle, guts, double, disc, court, and, overall, events, headrick, later, helped, to, develop, the, sport, of, disc, golf, which, was, first, played, with, frisbees, and, later, with, more, aerodynamic, beveled, rim, discs, by, inventing, standardized, targets, called, pole, holes, when, headrick, died, he, was, cremated, and, his, ashes, were, molded, into, memorial, discs, and, given, to, family, and, close, friends, and, sold, to, benefit, the, ed, headrick, memorial, museum, in, 1998, the, frisbee, was, inducted, into, the, national, toy, hall,

purpose, with, drivers, being, used, for, long, distance, throws, mid, range, discs, for, more, controlled, shots, and, putters, for, short, and, accurate, throws, into, the, target, the, rim, for, golf, discs, are, sharper, than, ultimate, frisbee, to, reduce, wind, drag, each, type, of, golf, disc, has, hundreds, of, variations, subject, to, a, uniform, requirement, in, the, size, of, discs, the, minimum, diameter, of, a, golf, disc, is, 21, cm, 8, 3, in, freestyle, discs, are, another, variation, of, flying, discs, that, are, used, in, freestyle, frisbee, competitions, these, discs, are, usually, smaller, and, lighter, than, other, types, of, flying, discs, most, freestyle, discs, have, a, diameter, of, 10, inches, 25, cm, or, less, and, a, weight, of, around, 160, grams, 5, 6, oz, but, this, is, subject, to, change, according, to, the, performer, s, need, the, ift, guts, competitions, in, northern, michigan, the, canadian, open, frisbee, championships, 1972, toronto, ontario,

players, each, team, defends, its, court, and, tries, to, land, a, flying, disc, in, the, opposing, court, dogs, and, their, human, flying, disc, throwers, compete, in, events, such, as, distance, catching, and, somewhat, choreographed, freestyle, catching, this, is, a, precision, and, accuracy, sport, in, which, individual, players, throw, a, flying, disc, at, a, target, pole, hole, in, 1926,
