cheese, is, a, type, of, dairy, product, produced, in, a, range, of, flavors, textures, and, forms, by, coagulation, of, the, milk, protein, casein, it, comprises, proteins, and, fat, from, milk, usually, the, milk, of, cows, buffalo, goats, or, sheep, during, production, milk, is, usually, acidified, and, either, the, enzymes, of, rennet, or, bacterial, enzymes, with, similar, activity, are, added, to, cause, the, casein, to, coagulate, the, solid, curds, are, then, separated, from, the, liquid, whey, and, pressed, into, finished, cheese, some, cheeses, have, aromatic, molds, on, the, rind, the, outer, layer, or, throughout, over, a, thousand, types, of, cheese, exist, produced, in, various, countries, their, styles, textures, and, flavors, depend, on, the, origin, of, the, milk, including, the, animal, s, diet, whether, they, have, been, pasteurised, the, butterfat, content, the, bacteria, and, mold, the, processing, and, how, long, they, have, been, aged, herbs, spices, or, wood, smoke, may, be, used, as, flavoring, agents, the, yellow, to, red, color, of, many, cheeses, is, produced, by, adding, annatto, other, added, ingredients, may, include, black, pepper, garlic, chives, or, cranberries, a, cheesemonger, or, specialist, seller, of, cheeses, may, have, expertise, with, selecting, purchasing, receiving, storing, and, ripening, cheeses, most, cheeses, are, acidified, by, bacteria, which, turn, milk, sugars, into, lactic, acid, the, addition, of, rennet, completes, the, curdling, vegetarian, varieties, of, rennet, are, available, most, are, produced, through, fermentation, by, the, fungus, mucor, miehei, but, others, have, been, extracted, from, cynara, thistles, for, a, few, cheeses, the, milk, is, curdled, by, adding, acids, such, as, vinegar, or, lemon, juice, cheese, is, valued, for, its, portability, long, shelf, life, and, high, content, of, fat, protein, calcium, and, phosphorus, cheese, is, more, compact, and, has, a, longer, shelf, life, than, milk, hard, cheeses, such, as, parmesan, last, longer, than, soft, cheeses, such, as, brie, or, goat, s, milk, cheese, the, long, storage, life, of, some, cheeses, especially, when, encased, in, a, protective, rind, allows, selling, when, markets, are, favorable, vacuum, packaging, of, block, shaped, cheeses, and, gas, flushing, of, plastic, bags, with, mixtures, of, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrogen, are, used, for, storage, and, mass, distribution, of, cheeses, in, the, 21st, century, the, word, cheese, comes, from, latin, caseus, from, which, the, modern, word, casein, is, derived, the, earliest, source, is, from, the, proto, indo, european, root, kwat, which, means, to, ferment, become, sour, that, gave, rise, to, c, ese, or, c, se, in, old, english, and, chese, in, middle, english, similar, words, are, shared, by, other, west, germanic, languages, west, frisian, tsiis, dutch, kaas, german, k, se, old, high, german, ch, si, all, from, the, reconstructed, west, germanic, form, k, s, which, in, turn, is, an, early, borrowing, from, latin, the, online, etymological, dictionary, states, that, cheese, derives, from, old, english, cyse, west, saxon, cese, anglian, from, west, germanic, kasjus, source, also, of, old, saxon, kasi, old, high, german, chasi, german, k, se, middle, dutch, case, dutch, kaas, from, latin, caseus, cheese, source, of, italian, cacio, spanish, queso, irish, caise, welsh, caws, the, online, etymological, dictionary, states, that, the, word, is, of, unknown, origin, perhaps, from, a, pie, root, kwat, to, ferment, become, sour, source, also, of, prakrit, chasi, buttermilk, old, church, slavonic, kvasu, leaven, fermented, drink, kyselu, sour, kyseti, to, turn, sour, czech, kysati, to, turn, sour, rot, sanskrit, kvathati, boils, seethes, gothic, hwa, jan, foam, when, the, romans, began, to, make, hard, cheeses, for, their, legionaries, supplies, a, new, word, started, to, be, used, formaticum, from, caseus, formatus, or, cheese, shaped, in, a, mold, it, is, from, this, word, that, the, french, fromage, standard, italian, formaggio, catalan, formatge, breton, fourmaj, and, occitan, fromatge, or, formatge, are, derived, of, the, romance, languages, spanish, portuguese, romanian, tuscan, and, some, southern, italian, dialects, use, words, derived, from, caseus, queso, queijo, ca, cacio, and, caso, for, example, the, word, cheese, is, occasionally, employed, as, in, head, cheese, to, mean, shaped, in, a, mold, cheese, is, an, ancient, food, whose, origins, predate, recorded, history, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, indicating, where, cheesemaking, originated, whether, in, europe, central, asia, or, the, middle, east, the, earliest, proposed, dates, for, the, origin, of, cheesemaking, range, from, around, 8000, bce, when, sheep, were, first, domesticated, because, animal, skins, and, inflated, internal, organs, have, provided, storage, vessels, for, a, range, of, foodstuffs, since, ancient, times, it, is, probable, that, the, process, of, cheese, making, was, discovered, accidentally, by, storing, milk, in, a, container, made, from, the, stomach, of, an, animal, resulting, in, the, milk, being, turned, to, curd, and, whey, by, the, rennet, from, the, stomach, there, is, a, legend, with, variations, about, the, discovery, of, cheese, by, an, arab, trader, who, used, this, method, of, storing, milk, the, earliest, evidence, of, cheesemaking, in, the, archaeological, record, dates, back, to, 5500, bce, and, is, found, in, what, is, now, kuyavia, poland, where, strainers, coated, with, milk, fat, molecules, have, been, found, the, earliest, evidence, of, cheesemaking, in, the, mediterranean, dates, back, to, 5200, bce, on, the, coast, of, the, dalmatia, region, of, croatia, cheesemaking, may, have, begun, independently, of, this, by, the, pressing, and, salting, of, curdled, milk, to, preserve, it, observation, that, the, effect, of, making, cheese, in, an, animal, stomach, gave, more, solid, and, better, textured, curds, may, have, led, to, the, deliberate, addition, of, rennet, early, archeological, evidence, of, egyptian, cheese, has, been, found, in, egyptian, tomb, murals, dating, to, about, 2000, bce, a, 2018, scientific, paper, stated, that, the, world, s, oldest, cheese, dating, to, approximately, 1200, bce, 3200, years, before, present, was, found, in, ancient, egyptian, tombs, the, earliest, cheeses, were, likely, quite, sour, and, salty, similar, in, texture, to, rustic, cottage, cheese, or, feta, a, crumbly, flavorful, greek, cheese, cheese, produced, in, europe, where, climates, are, cooler, than, the, middle, east, required, less, salt, for, preservation, with, less, salt, and, acidity, the, cheese, became, a, suitable, environment, for, useful, microbes, and, molds, giving, aged, cheeses, their, respective, flavors, the, earliest, ever, discovered, preserved, cheese, was, found, in, the, taklamakan, desert, in, xinjiang, china, dating, back, as, early, as, 1615, bce, 3600, years, before, present, ancient, greek, mythology, credited, aristaeus, with, the, discovery, of, cheese, homer, s, odyssey, 8th, century, bce, describes, the, monstrous, cyclops, making, and, storing, sheep, s, and, goats, milk, cheese, translation, by, samuel, butler, we, soon, reached, his, cave, but, he, was, out, shepherding, so, we, went, inside, and, took, stock, of, all, that, we, could, see, his, cheese, racks, were, loaded, with, cheeses, and, he, had, more, lambs, and, kids, than, his, pens, could, hold, when, he, had, so, done, he, sat, down, and, milked, his, ewes, and, goats, all, in, due, course, and, then, let, each, of, them, have, her, own, young, he, curdled, half, the, milk, and, set, it,

pliny, the, elder, it, had, become, a, sophisticated, enterprise, by, the, time, the, roman, empire, came, into, being, pliny, the, elder, also, mentions, in, his, writings, caseus, helveticus, a, hard, sbrinz, like, cheese, produced, by, the, helvetii, cheese, was, an, everyday, food, and, cheesemaking, a, mature, art, in, the, roman, empire, pliny, s, natural, history, 77, ce, devotes, a, chapter, xi, 97, to, describing, the, diversity, of, cheeses, enjoyed, by, romans, of, the, early, empire, he, stated, that, the, best, cheeses, came, from, the, villages, near, n, mes, but, did, not, keep, long, and, had, to, be, eaten, fresh, cheeses, of, the, alps, and, apennines, were, as, remarkable, for, their, variety, then, as, now, a, ligurian, cheese, was, noted, for, being, made, mostly, from, sheep, s, milk, and, some, cheeses, produced, nearby, were, stated, to, weigh, as, much, as, a, thousand, pounds, each, goats, milk, cheese, was, a, recent, taste, in, rome, improved, over, the,

provided, cheese, for, constantinople, many, cheeses, popular, today, were, first, recorded, in, the, late, middle, ages, or, after, cheeses, such, as, cheddar, around, 1500, parmesan, in, 1597, gouda, in, 1697, and, camembert, in, 1791, show, post, middle, ages, dates, in, 1546, the, proverbs, of, john, heywood, claimed, the, moon, is, made, of, a, green, cheese, greene, may, refer, here, not, to, the, color, as, many, now, think, but, to, being, new, or, unaged, variations, on, this, sentiment, were, long, repeated, and, nasa, exploited, this, myth, for, an, april, fools, day, spoof, announcement, in, 2006, until, its, modern, spread, along, with, european, culture, cheese, was, nearly, unheard, of, in, east, asian, cultures, and, in, the, pre, columbian, americas, and, had, only, limited, use, in, sub, mediterranean, africa, mainly, being, widespread, and, popular, only, in, europe, the, middle, east, the, indian, subcontinent, and, areas, influenced, by, those, cultures, but, with, the, spread, first, of, european, imperialism, and, later, of, euro, american, culture, and, food, cheese, has, gradually, become, known, and, increasingly, popular, worldwide, the, first, factory, for, the, industrial, production, of, cheese, opened, in, switzerland, in, 1815, but, large, scale, production, first, found, real, success, in, the, united, states, credit, usually, goes, to, jesse, williams, a, dairy, farmer, from, rome, new, york, who, in, 1851, started, making, cheese, in, an, assembly, line, fashion, using, the, milk, from, neighboring, farms, this, made, cheddar, cheese, one, of, the, first, us, industrial, foods, within, decades, hundreds, of, such, commercial, dairy, associations, existed, the, 1860s, saw, the, beginnings, of, mass, produced, rennet, and, by, the, turn, of, the, century, scientists, were, producing, pure, microbial, cultures, before, then, bacteria, in, cheesemaking, had, come, from, the, environment, or, from, recycling, an, earlier, batch, s, whey, the, pure, cultures, meant, a, more, standardized, cheese, could, be, produced, factory, made, cheese, overtook, traditional, cheesemaking, in, the, world, war, ii, era, and, factories, have, been, the, source, of, most, cheese, in, america, and, europe, ever, since, by, 2012, cheese, was, one, of, the, most, shoplifted, items, from, supermarkets, worldwide, in, 2021, world, production, of, cheese, from, whole, cow, milk, was, 22, 2, million, tonnes, with, the, united, states, accounting, for, 28, of, the, total, followed, by, germany, france, italy, and, the, netherlands, as, secondary, producers, table, as, of, 2021, the, carbon, footprint, of, a, kilogram, of, cheese, ranged, from, 6, to, 12, kg, of, co, 2, eq, depending, on, the, amount, of, milk, used, accordingly, it, is, generally, lower, than, beef, or, lamb, but, higher, than, other, foods, france, iceland, finland, denmark, and, germany, were, the, highest, consumers, of, cheese, in, 2014, averaging, 25, kg, 55, lb, per, person, per, annum, a, required, step, in, cheesemaking, is, to, separate, the, milk, into, solid, curds, and, liquid, whey, usually, this, is, done, by, acidifying, souring, the, milk, and, adding, rennet, the, acidification, can, be, accomplished, directly, by, the, addition, of, an, acid, such, as, vinegar, in, a, few, cases, paneer, queso, fresco, more, commonly, starter, bacteria, are, employed, instead, which, convert, milk, sugars, into, lactic, acid, the, same, bacteria, and, the, enzymes, they, produce, also, play, a, large, role, in, the, eventual, flavor, of, aged, cheeses, most, cheeses, are, made, with, starter, bacteria, from, the, lactococcus, lactobacillus, or, streptococcus, genera, swiss, starter, cultures, also, include, propionibacter, shermani, which, produces, propionic, acid, and, carbon, dioxide, gas, bubbles, during, aging, giving, swiss, cheese, or, emmental, its, holes, called, eyes, some, fresh, cheeses, are, curdled, only, by, acidity, but, most, cheeses, also, use, rennet, rennet, sets, the, cheese, into, a, strong, and, rubbery, gel, compared, to, the, fragile, curds, produced, by, acidic, coagulation, alone, it, also, allows, curdling, at, a, lower, acidity, important, because, flavor, making, bacteria, are, inhibited, in, high, acidity, environments, in, general, softer, smaller, fresher, cheeses, are, curdled, with, a, greater, proportion, of, acid, to, rennet, than, harder, larger, longer, aged, varieties, while, rennet, was, traditionally, produced, via, extraction, from, the, inner, mucosa, of, the, fourth, stomach, chamber, of, slaughtered, young, unweaned, calves, most, rennet, used, today, in, cheesemaking, is, produced, recombinantly, the, majority, of, the, applied, chymosin, is, retained, in, the, whey, and, at, most, may, be, present, in, cheese, in, trace, quantities, in, ripe, cheese, the, type, and, provenance, of, chymosin, used, in, production, cannot, be, determined, at, this, point, the, cheese, has, set, into, a, very, moist, gel, some, soft, cheeses, are, now, essentially, complete, they, are, drained, salted, and, packaged, for, most, of, the, rest, the, curd, is, cut, into, small, cubes, this, allows, water, to, drain, from, the, individual, pieces, of, curd, some, hard, cheeses, are, then, heated, to, temperatures, in, the, range, of, 35, 55, c, 95, 131, f, this, forces, more, whey, from, the, cut, curd, it, also, changes, the, taste, of, the, finished, cheese, affecting, both, the, bacterial, culture, and, the, milk, chemistry, cheeses, that, are, heated, to, the, higher, temperatures, are, usually, made, with, thermophilic, starter, bacteria, that, survive, this, step, either, lactobacilli, or, streptococci, salt, has, roles, in, cheese, besides, adding, a, salty, flavor, it, preserves, cheese, from, spoiling, draws, moisture, from, the, curd, and, firms, cheese, s, texture, in, an, interaction, with, its, proteins, some, cheeses, are, salted, from, the, outside, with, dry, salt, or, brine, washes, most, cheeses, have, the, salt, mixed, directly, into, the, curds, other, techniques, influence, a, cheese, s, texture, and, flavor, some, examples, are, most, cheeses, achieve, their, final, shape, when, the, curds, are, pressed, into, a, mold, or, form, the, harder, the, cheese, the, more, pressure, is, applied, the, pressure, drives, out, moisture, the, molds, are, designed, to, allow, water, to, escape, and, unifies, the, curds, into, a, single, solid, body, a, newborn, cheese, is, usually, salty, yet, bland, in, flavor, and, for, harder, varieties, rubbery, in, texture, these, qualities, are, sometimes, enjoyed, cheese, curds, are, eaten, on, their, own, but, normally, cheeses, are, left, to, rest, under, controlled, conditions, this, aging, period, also, called, ripening, or, from, the, french, affinage, lasts, from, a, few, days, to, several, years, as, a, cheese, ages, microbes, and, enzymes, transform, texture, and, intensify, flavor, this, transformation, is, largely, a, result, of, the, breakdown, of, casein, proteins, and, milkfat, into, a, complex, mix, of, amino, acids, amines, and, fatty, acids, some, cheeses, have, additional, bacteria, or, molds, intentionally, introduced, before, or, during, aging, in, traditional, cheesemaking, these, microbes, might, be, already, present, in, the, aging, room, they, are, allowed, to, settle, and, grow, on, the, stored, cheeses, more, often, today, prepared, cultures, are, used, giving, more, consistent, results, and, putting, fewer, constraints, on, the, environment, where, the, cheese, ages, these, cheeses, include, soft, ripened, cheeses, such, as, brie, and, camembert, blue, cheeses, such, as, roquefort, stilton, gorgonzola, and, rind, washed, cheeses, such, as, limburger, there, are, many, types, of, cheese, with, around, 500, different, varieties, recognized, by, the, international, dairy, federation, more, than, 400, identified, by, walter, and, hargrove, more, than, 500, by, burkhalter, and, more, than, 1, 000, by, sandine, and, elliker, the, varieties, may, be, grouped, or, classified, into, types, according, to, criteria, such, as, length, of, ageing, texture, methods, of, making, fat, content, animal, milk, country, or, region, of, origin, etc, with, these, criteria, either, being, used, singly, or, in, combination, but, with, no, single, method, being, universally, used, the, method, most, commonly, and, traditionally, used, is, based, on, moisture, content, which, is, then, further, discriminated, by, fat, content, and, curing, or, ripening, methods, some, attempts, have, been, made, to, rationalise, the, classification, of, cheese, a, scheme, was, proposed, by, pieter, walstra, which, uses, the, primary, and, secondary, starter, combined, with, moisture, content, and, walter, and, hargrove, suggested, classifying, by, production, methods, which, produces, 18, types, which, are, then, further, grouped, by, moisture, content, the, british, cheese, board, once, claimed, that, britain, has, approximately, 700, distinct, local, cheeses, france, and, italy, have, perhaps, 400, each, a, french, proverb, holds, there, is, a, different, french, cheese, for, every, day, of, the, year, and, charles, de, gaulle, once, asked, how, can, you, govern, a, country, in, which, there, are, 246, kinds, of, cheese, at, refrigerator, temperatures, the, fat, in, a, piece, of, cheese, is, as, hard, as, unsoftened, butter, and, its, protein, structure, is, stiff, as, well, flavor, and, odor, compounds, are, less, easily, liberated, when, cold, for, improvements, in, flavor, and, texture, it, is, widely, advised, that, cheeses, be, allowed, to, warm, up, to, room, temperature, before, eating, if, the, cheese, is, further, warmed, to, 26, 32, c, 79, 90, f, the, fats, will, begin, to, sweat, out, as, they, go, beyond, soft, to, fully, liquid, above, room, temperatures, most, hard, cheeses, melt, rennet, curdled, cheeses, have, a, gel, like, protein, matrix, that, is, broken, down, by, heat, when, enough, protein, bonds, are, broken, the, cheese, itself, turns, from, a, solid, to, a, viscous, liquid, soft, high, moisture, cheeses, will, melt, at, around, 55, c, 131, f, while, hard, low, moisture, cheeses, such, as, parmesan, remain, solid, until, they, reach, about, 82, c, 180, f, acid, set, cheeses, including, halloumi, paneer, some, whey, cheeses, and, many, varieties, of, fresh, goat, cheese, have, a, protein, structure, that, remains, intact, at, high, temperatures, when, cooked, these, cheeses, just, get, firmer, as, water, evaporates, some, cheeses, like, raclette, melt, smoothly, many, tend, to, become, stringy, or, suffer, from, a, separation, of, their, fats, many, of, these, can, be, coaxed, into, melting, smoothly, in, the, presence, of, acids, or, starch, fondue, with, wine, providing, the, acidity, is, a, good, example, of, a, smoothly, melted,
