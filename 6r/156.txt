family, from, latin, familia, is, a, group, of, people, related, either, by, consanguinity, by, recognized, birth, or, affinity, by, marriage, or, other, relationship, it, forms, the, basis, for, social, order, ideally, families, offer, predictability, structure, and, safety, as, members, mature, and, learn, to, participate, in, the, community, historically, most, human, societies, use, family, as, the, primary, purpose, of, attachment, nurturance, and, socialization, anthropologists, classify, most, family, organizations, as, matrifocal, a, mother, and, her, children, patrifocal, a, father, and, his, children, conjugal, a, married, couple, with, children, also, called, the, nuclear, family, avuncular, a, man, his, sister, and, her, children, or, extended, in, addition, to, parents, spouse, and, children, may, include, grandparents, aunts, uncles, or, cousins, the, field, of, genealogy, aims, to, trace, family, lineages, through, history, the, family, is, also, an, important, economic, unit, studied, in, family, economics, the, word, families, can, be, used, metaphorically, to, create, more, inclusive, categories, such, as, community, nationhood, and, global, village, one, of, the, primary, functions, of, the, family, involves, providing, a, framework, for, the, production, and, reproduction, of, persons, biologically, and, socially, this, can, occur, through, the, sharing, of, material, substances, such, as, food, the, giving, and, receiving, of, care, and, nurture, nurture, kinship, jural, rights, and, obligations, also, moral, and, sentimental, ties, thus, one, s, experience, of, one, s, family, shifts, over, time, there, are, different, perspectives, of, the, term, family, from, the, perspective, of, children, the, family, is, a, family, of, orientation, the, family, serves, to, locate, children, socially, and, plays, a, major, role, in, their, enculturation, and, socialization, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, parent, s, the, family, is, a, family, of, procreation, the, goal, of, which, is, to, produce, enculturate, and, socialize, children, however, producing, children, is, not, the, only, function, of, the, family, in, societies, with, a, sexual, division, of, labor, marriage, and, the, resulting, relationship, between, two, people, it, is, necessary, for, the, formation, of, an, economically, productive, household, c, c, harris, notes, that, the, western, conception, of, a, family, is, ambiguous, and, confused, with, the, household, as, revealed, in, the, different, contexts, in, which, the, word, is, used, olivia, harris, states, this, confusion, is, not, accidental, but, indicative, of, the, familial, ideology, of, capitalist, western, countries, that, pass, social, legislation, that, insists, members, of, a, nuclear, family, should, live, together, and, that, those, not, so, related, should, not, live, together, despite, the, ideological, and, legal, pressures, a, large, percentage, of, families, do, not, conform, to, the, ideal, nuclear, family, type, the, total, fertility, rate, of, women, varies, from, country, to, country, from, a, high, rate, of, 6, 76, children, born, per, woman, in, niger, to, a, low, rate, of, 0, 81, in, singapore, as, of, 2015, fertility, is, below, replacement, in, all, eastern, european, and, southern, european, countries, and, particularly, high, in, sub, saharan, african, countries, in, some, cultures, the, mother, s, preference, of, family, size, influences, that, of, the, children, s, through, early, adulthood, a, parent, s, number, of, children, strongly, correlates, with, the, number, of, children, that, their, children, will, eventually, have, although, early, western, cultural, anthropologists, and, sociologists, considered, family, and, kinship, to, be, universally, associated, with, relations, by, blood, based, on, ideas, common, in, their, own, cultures, later, research, has, shown, that, many, societies, instead, understand, family, through, ideas, of, living, together, the, sharing, of, food, e, g, milk, kinship, and, sharing, care, and, nurture, sociologists, have, a, special, interest, in, the, function, and, status, of, family, forms, in, stratified, especially, capitalist, societies, according, to, the, work, of, scholars, max, weber, alan, macfarlane, steven, ozment, jack, goody, and, peter, laslett, the, huge, transformation, that, led, to, modern, marriage, in, western, democracies, was, fueled, by, the, religio, cultural, value, system, provided, by, elements, of, judaism, early, christianity, roman, catholic, canon, law, and, the, protestant, reformation, much, sociological, historical, and, anthropological, research, dedicates, itself, to, the, understanding, of, this, variation, and, of, changes, in, the, family, that, form, over, time, levitan, claims, times, have, changed, it, is, more, acceptable, and, encouraged, for, mothers, to, work, and, fathers, to, spend, more, time, at, home, with, the, children, the, way, roles, are, balanced, between, the, parents, will, help, children, grow, and, learn, valuable, life, lessons, there, is, great, importance, of, communication, and, equality, in, families, in, order, to, avoid, role, strain, historically, the, most, common, family, type, was, one, in, which, grandparents, parents, and, children, lived, together, as, a, single, unit, for, example, the, household, might, include, the, owners, of, a, farm, one, or, more, of, their, adult, children, the, adult, child, s, spouse, and, the, adult, child, s, own, children, the, owners, grandchildren, members, of, the, extended, family, are, not, included, in, this, family, group, sometimes, skipped, generation, families, such, as, a, grandparents, living, with, their, grandchildren, are, included, in, the, us, this, arrangement, declined, after, world, war, ii, reaching, a, low, point, in, 1980, when, about, one, out, of, every, eight, people, in, the, us, lived, in, a, multigenerational, family, the, numbers, have, risen, since, then, with, one, in, five, people, in, the, us, living, in, a, multigenerational, family, as, of, 2016, the, increasing, popularity, is, partly, driven, by, demographic, changes, and, the, economic, shifts, associated, with, the, boomerang, generation, multigenerational, households, are, less, common, in, canada, where, about, 6, of, people, living, in, canada, were, living, in, multigenerational, families, as, of, 2016, but, the, proportion, of, multigenerational, households, was, increasing, rapidly, driven, by, increasing, numbers, of, aboriginal, families, immigrant, families, and, high, housing, costs, in, some, regions, the, term, nuclear, family, is, commonly, used, to, refer, to, conjugal, families, a, conjugal, family, includes, only, the, spouses, and, unmarried, children, who, are, not, of, age, some, sociologists, distinguish, between, conjugal, families, relatively, independent, of, the, kindred, of, the, parents, and, of, other, families, in, general, and, nuclear, families, which, maintain, relatively, close, ties, with, their, kindred, other, family, structures, with, for, example, blended, parents, single, parents, and, domestic, partnerships, have, begun, to, challenge, the, normality, of, the, nuclear, family, a, single, parent, family, consists, of, one, parent, together, with, their, children, where, the, parent, is, either, widowed, divorced, and, not, remarried, or, never, married, the, parent, may, have, sole, custody, of, the, children, or, separated, parents, may, have, a, shared, parenting, arrangement, where, the, children, divide, their, time, possibly, equally, between, two, different, single, parent, families, or, between, one, single, parent, family, and, one, blended, family, as, compared, to, sole, custody, physical, mental, and, social, well, being, of, children, may, be, improved, by, shared, parenting, arrangements, and, by, children, having, greater, access, to, both, parents, the, number, of, single, parent, families, have, been, increasing, due, to, the, divorce, rate, climbing, drastically, during, the, years, 1965, 1995, and, about, half, of, all, children, in, the, united, states, will, live, in, a, single, parent, family, at, some, point, before, they, reach, the, age, of, 18, most, single, parent, families, are, headed, by, a, mother, but, the, number, of, single, parent, families, headed, by, fathers, is, increasing, a, matrifocal, family, consists, of, a, mother, and, her, children, generally, these, children, are, her, biological, offspring, although, adoption, of, children, occurs, in, nearly, every, society, this, kind, of, family, occurs, commonly, where, women, have, the, resources, to, rear, their, children, by, themselves, or, where, men, are, more, mobile, than, women, as, a, definition, a, family, or, domestic, group, is, matrifocal, when, it, is, centred, on, a, woman, and, her, children, in, this, case, the, father, s, of, these, children, are, intermittently, present, in, the, life, of, the, group, and, occupy, a, secondary, place, the, children, s, mother, is, not, necessarily, the, wife, of, one, of, the, children, s, fathers, the, name, matrifocal, was, coined, in, guiana, but, it, is, defined, differently, in, other, countries, for, nayar, families, the, family, have, the, male, as, the, center, or, the, head, of, the, family, either, the, step, father, father, brother, rather, than, the, mother, the, term, extended, family, is, also, common, especially, in, the, united, states, this, term, has, two, distinct, meanings, these, types, refer, to, ideal, or, normative, structures, found, in, particular, societies, any, society, will, exhibit, some, variation, in, the, actual, composition, and, conception, of, families, historically, extended, families, were, the, basic, family, unit, in, the, catholic, culture, and, countries, such, as, southern, europe, and, latin, america, and, in, asian, middle, eastern, and, eastern, orthodox, countries, the, term, family, of, choice, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, chosen, family, or, found, family, is, common, within, the, lgbt, community, veterans, individuals, who, have, suffered, abuse, and, those, who, have, no, contact, with, their, biological, parents, it, refers, to, the, group, of, people, in, an, individual, s, life, that, satisfies, the, typical, role, of, family, as, a, support, system, the, term, differentiates, between, the, family, of, origin, the, biological, family, or, that, in, which, people, are, raised, and, those, that, actively, assume, that, ideal, role, the, family, of, choice, may, or, may, not, include, some, or, all, of, the, members, of, the, family, of, origin, this, family, is, not, one, that, follows, the, normal, familial, structure, like, having, a, father, a, mother, and, children, this, is, family, as, a, group, of, people, that, rely, on, each, other, like, a, family, of, origin, would, this, terminology, stems, from, the, fact, that, many, lgbt, individuals, upon, coming, out, face, rejection, or, shame, from, the, families, they, were, raised, in, the, term, family, of, choice, is, also, used, by, individuals, in, the, 12, step, communities, who, create, close, knit, family, ties, through, the, recovery, process, as, a, family, system, families, of, choice, face, unique, issues, without, legal, safeguards, families, of, choice, may, struggle, when, medical, educational, or, governmental, institutions, fail, to, recognize, their, legitimacy, if, members, of, the, chosen, family, have, been, disowned, by, their, family, of, origin, they, may, experience, surrogate, grief, displacing, anger, loss, or, anxious, attachment, onto, their, new, family, the, term, blended, family, or, stepfamily, describes, families, with, mixed, parents, one, or, both, parents, remarried, bringing, children, of, the, former, family, into, the, new, family, also, in, sociology, particularly, in, the, works, of, social, psychologist, michael, lamb, traditional, family, refers, to, a, middle, class, family, with, a, bread, winning, father, and, a, stay, at, home, mother, married, to, each, other, and, raising, their, biological, children, and, nontraditional, to, exceptions, to, this, rule, most, of, the, us, households, are, now, non, traditional, under, this, definition, critics, of, the, term, traditional, family, point, out, that, in, most, cultures, and, at, most, times, the, extended, family, model, has, been, most, common, not, the, nuclear, family, though, it, has, had, a, longer, tradition, in, england, than, in, other, parts, of, europe, and, asia, which, contributed, large, numbers, of, immigrants, to, the, americas, the, nuclear, family, became, the, most, common, form, in, the, u, s, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, in, terms, of, communication, patterns, in, families, there, are, a, certain, set, of, beliefs, within, the, family, that, reflect, how, its, members, should, communicate, and, interact, these, family, communication, patterns, arise, from, two, underlying, sets, of, beliefs, one, being, conversation, orientation, the, degree, to, which, the, importance, of, communication, is, valued, and, two, conformity, orientation, the, degree, to, which, families, should, emphasize, similarities, or, differences, regarding, attitudes, beliefs, and, values, blended, families, is, complex, ranging, from, stepfamilies, to, cohabitating, families, an, individual, living, with, guardians, who, are, not, married, with, step, or, half, siblings, while, it, is, not, too, different, from, stepfamilies, cohabiting, families, pose, a, prevalent, psychological, effect, on, youths, some, adolescents, would, be, prone, to, acts, of, delinquency, and, experiencing, problems, in, school, ranging, from, a, decrease, in, academic, performance, to, increased, problematic, behavior, it, coincides, with, other, researches, on, the, trajectories, of, stepfamilies, where, some, experienced, familyhood, but, others, lacking, connection, emotional, detachment, from, members, within, stepfamilies, contributes, to, this, uncertainty, furthering, the, tension, that, these, families, may, establish, the, transition, from, an, old, family, to, a, new, family, that, falls, under, blended, families, would, also, become, problematic, as, the, activities, that, were, once, performed, in, the, old, family, may, not, transfer, well, within, the, new, family, for, adolescents, a, monogamous, family, is, based, on, a, legal, or, social, monogamy, in, this, case, an, individual, has, only, one, official, partner, during, their, lifetime, or, at, any, one, time, i, e, serial, monogamy, this, means, that, a, person, may, not, have, several, different, legal, spouses, at, the, same, time, as, this, is, usually, prohibited, by, bigamy, laws, the, act, of, entering, into, a, marriage, with, one, person, while, still, legally, married, to, another, in, jurisdictions, that, require, monogamous, marriages, polygamy, is, a, marriage, that, includes, more, than, two, partners, when, a, man, is, married, to, more, than, one, wife, at, a, time, the, relationship, is, called, polygyny, and, when, a, woman, is, married, to, more, than, one, husband, at, a, time, it, is, called, polyandry, if, a, marriage, includes, multiple, husbands, and, wives, it, can, be, called, polyamory, group, or, conjoint, marriage, polygyny, is, a, form, of, plural, marriage, in, which, a, man, is, allowed, more, than, one, wife, in, modern, countries, that, permit, polygamy, polygyny, is, typically, the, only, form, permitted, polygyny, is, practiced, primarily, but, not, only, in, parts, of, the, middle, east, and, africa, and, is, often, associated, with, islam, however, there, are, certain, conditions, in, islam, that, must, be, met, to, perform, polygyny, polyandry, is, a, form, of, marriage, whereby, a, woman, takes, two, or, more, husbands, at, the, same, time, fraternal, polyandry, where, two, or, more, brothers, are, married, to, the, same, wife, is, a, common, form, of, polyandry, polyandry, was, traditionally, practiced, in, areas, of, the, himalayan, mountains, among, tibetans, in, nepal, in, parts, of, china, and, in, parts, of, northern, india, polyandry, is, most, common, in, societies, marked, by, high, male, mortality, or, where, males, will, often, be, apart, from, the, rest, of, the, family, for, a, considerable, period, of, time, a, first, degree, relative, is, one, who, shares, 50, of, your, dna, through, direct, inheritance, such, as, a, full, sibling, parent, or, progeny, there, is, another, measure, for, the, degree, of, relationship, which, is, determined, by, counting, up, generations, to, the, first, common, ancestor, and, back, down, to, the, target, individual, which, is, used, for, various, genealogical, and, legal, purposes, in, his, book, systems, of, consanguinity, and, affinity, of, the, human, family, anthropologist, lewis, henry, morgan, 1818, 1881, performed, the, first, survey, of, kinship, terminologies, in, use, around, the, world, although, much, of, his, work, is, now, considered, dated, he, argued, that, kinship, terminologies, reflect, different, sets, of, distinctions, for, example, most, kinship, terminologies, distinguish, between, sexes, the, difference, between, a, brother, and, a, sister, and, between, generations, the, difference, between, a, child, and, a, parent, moreover, he, argued, kinship, terminologies, distinguish, between, relatives, by, blood, and, marriage, although, recently, some, anthropologists, have, argued, that, many, societies, define, kinship, in, terms, other, than, blood, morgan, made, a, distinction, between, kinship, systems, that, use, classificatory, terminology, and, those, that, use, descriptive, terminology, classificatory, systems, are, generally, and, erroneously, understood, to, be, those, that, class, together, with, a, single, term, relatives, who, actually, do, not, have, the, same, type, of, relationship, to, ego, what, defines, same, type, of, relationship, under, such, definitions, seems, to, be, genealogical, relationship, this, is, problematic, given, that, any, genealogical, description, no, matter, how, standardized, employs, words, originating, in, a, folk, understanding, of, kinship, what, morgan, s, terminology, actually, differentiates, are, those, classificatory, kinship, systems, that, do, not, distinguish, lineal, and, collateral, relationships, and, those, descriptive, kinship, systems, that, do, morgan, a, lawyer, came, to, make, this, distinction, in, an, effort, to, understand, seneca, inheritance, practices, a, seneca, man, s, effects, were, inherited, by, his, sisters, children, rather, than, by, his, own, children, morgan, identified, six, basic, patterns, of, kinship, terminologies, most, western, societies, employ, eskimo, kinship, terminology, this, kinship, terminology, commonly, occurs, in, societies, with, strong, conjugal, where, families, have, a, degree, of, relative, mobility, typically, societies, with, conjugal, families, also, favor, neolocal, residence, thus, upon, marriage, a, person, separates, from, the, nuclear, family, of, their, childhood, family, of, orientation, and, forms, a, new, nuclear, family, family, of, procreation, such, systems, generally, assume, that, the, mother, s, husband, is, also, the, biological, father, the, system, uses, highly, descriptive, terms, for, the, nuclear, family, and, progressively, more, classificatory, as, the, relatives, become, more, and, more, collateral, the, system, emphasizes, the, nuclear, family, members, of, the, nuclear, family, use, highly, descriptive, kinship, terms, identifying, directly, only, the, husband, wife, mother, father, son, daughter, brother, and, sister, all, other, relatives, are, grouped, together, into, categories, members, of, the, nuclear, family, may, be, lineal, or, collateral, kin, for, whom, these, are, family, refer, to, them, in, descriptive, terms, that, build, on, the, terms, used, within, the, nuclear, family, or, use, the, nuclear, family, term, directly, nuclear, family, of, orientation, nuclear, conjugal, family, nuclear, non, lineal, family, a, sibling, is, a, collateral, relative, with, a, minimal, removal, for, collateral, relatives, with, one, additional, removal, one, generation, more, distant, from, a, common, ancestor, on, one, side, more, classificatory, terms, come, into, play, these, terms, aunt, uncle, niece, and, nephew, do, not, build, on, the, terms, used, within, the, nuclear, family, as, most, are, not, traditionally, members, of, the, household, these, terms, do, not, traditionally, differentiate, between, a, collateral, relatives, and, a, person, married, to, a, collateral, relative, both, collateral, and, aggregate, collateral, relatives, with, additional, removals, on, each, side, are, cousins, this, is, the, most, classificatory, term, and, can, be, distinguished, by, degrees, of, collaterality, and, by, generation, removal, when, only, the, subject, has, the, additional, removal, the, relative, is, the, subject, s, parents, siblings, the, terms, aunt, and, uncle, are, used, for, female, and, male, relatives, respectively, when, only, the, relative, has, the, additional, removal, the, relative, is, the, subjects, siblings, child, the, terms, niece, and, nephew, are, used, for, female, and, male, relatives, respectively, the, spouse, of, a, biological, aunt, or, uncle, is, an, aunt, or, uncle, and, the, nieces, and, nephews, of, a, spouse, are, nieces, and, nephews, with, further, removal, by, the, subject, for, aunts, and, uncles, and, by, the, relative, for, nieces, and, nephews, the, prefix, grand, modifies, these, terms, with, further, removal, the, prefix, becomes, great, grand, adding, another, great, for, each, additional, generation, for, large, numbers, of, generations, a, number, can, be, substituted, for, example, fourth, great, grandson, four, greats, grandson, or, four, times, great, grandson, when, the, subject, and, the, relative, have, an, additional, removal, they, are, cousins, a, cousin, with, minimal, removal, is, a, first, cousin, i, e, the, child, of, the, subjects, uncle, or, aunt, degrees, of, collaterality, and, removals, are, used, to, more, precisely, describe, the, relationship, between, cousins, the, degree, is, the, number, of, generations, subsequent, to, the, common, ancestor, before, a, parent, of, one, of, the, cousins, is, found, while, the, removal, is, the, difference, between, the, number, of, generations, from, each, cousin, to, the, common, ancestor, the, difference, between, the, generations, the, cousins, are, from, cousins, of, an, older, generation, in, other, words, one, s, parents, first, cousins, although, technically, first, cousins, once, removed, are, often, classified, with, aunts, and, uncles, english, speakers, mark, relationships, by, marriage, except, for, wife,

is, traced, through, his, or, her, father, s, lineage, it, generally, involves, the, inheritance, of, property, rights, names, or, titles, by, persons, related, through, male, kin, a, patriline, father, line, is, a, person, s, father, and, additional, ancestors, that, are, traced, only, through, males, one, s, patriline, is, thus, a, record, of, descent, from, a, man, in, which, the, individuals, in, all, intervening, generations, are, male, in, cultural, anthropology, a, patrilineage, is, a, consanguineal, male, and, female, kinship, group, each, of, whose, members, is, descended, from, the, common, ancestor, through, male, forebears, matrilineality, is, a, form, of, kinship, system, in, which, an, individual, s, family, membership, derives, from, and, is, traced, through, his, or, her, mother, s, lineage, it, may, also, correlate, with, a, societal, system, in, which, each, person, is, identified, with, their, matriline, their, mother, s, lineage, and, which, can, involve, the, inheritance, of, property, and, titles, a, matriline, is, a, line, of, descent, from, a, female, ancestor, to, a, descendant, in, which, the, individuals, in, all, intervening, generations, are, mothers, in, other, words, a, mother, line, in, a, matrilineal, descent, system, an, individual, is, considered, to, belong, to, the, same, descent, group, as, her, or, his, mother, this, matrilineal, descent, pattern, is, in, contrast, to, the, more, common, patrilineal, descent, pattern, bilateral, descent, is, a, form, of, kinship, system, in, which, an, individual, s, family, membership, derives, from, and, is, traced, through, both, the, paternal, and, maternal, sides, the, relatives, on, the, mother, s, side, and, father, s, side, are, equally, important, for, emotional, ties, or, for, transfer, of, property, or, wealth, it, is, a, family, arrangement, where, descent, and, inheritance, are, passed, equally, through, both, parents, families, who, use, this, system, trace, descent, through, both, parents, simultaneously, and, recognize, multiple, ancestors, but, unlike, with, cognatic, descent, it, is, not, used, to, form, descent, groups, traditionally, this, is, found, among, some, groups, in, west, africa, india, australia, indonesia, melanesia, malaysia, and, polynesia, anthropologists, believe, that, a, tribal, structure, based, on, bilateral, descent,
