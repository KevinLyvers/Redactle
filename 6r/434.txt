bowls, also, known, as, lawn, bowls, or, lawn, bowling, is, a, sport, in, which, players, try, to, roll, their, ball, called, a, bowl, closest, to, a, smaller, ball, known, as, a, jack, or, sometimes, a, kitty, the, bowls, are, heavier, on, one, side, so, that, they, turn, when, being, rolled, the, game, is, played, either, in, teams, or, one, against, one, the, game, was, first, played, in, the, 13th, century, the, game, is, played, on, grass, although, other, surfaces, are, sometimes, used, matches, are, held, either, until, one, player, gets, to, a, score, or, when, a, number, of, ends, are, played, the, game, is, mostly, played, on, a, bowling, green, which, can, vary, by, the, type, of, bowls, being, played, whilst, the, game, is, often, played, outdoors, there, are, indoor, bowling, venues, and, can, also, be, played, on, rollable, carpets, for, outdoor, games, this, is, usually, on, grass, however, it, can, also, be, played, on, cotula, in, new, zealand, bowls, is, a, variant, of, the, boules, games, italian, bocce, which, in, their, general, form, are, of, ancient, or, prehistoric, origin, ancient, greek, variants, are, recorded, that, involved, throwing, light, objects, such, as, flat, stones, coins, or, later, also, stone, balls, as, far, as, possible, the, aspect, of, tossing, the, balls, to, approach, a, target, as, closely, as, possible, is, recorded, in, ancient, rome, this, game, was, spread, to, roman, gaul, by, soldiers, or, sailors, a, roman, sepulchre, in, florence, shows, people, playing, this, game, stooping, down, to, measure, the, points, bowls, in, england, has, been, traced, certainly, to, the, 13th, century, and, conjecturally, to, the, 12th, century, william, fitzstephen, d, about, 1190, in, his, biography, of, thomas, becket, gives, a, graphic, sketch, of, the, london, of, his, day, and, writing, of, the, summer, amusements, of, young, men, says, that, on, holidays, they, were, exercised, in, leaping, shooting, wrestling, casting, of, stones, and, throwing, of, javelins, fitted, with, loops, for, the, purpose, which, they, strive, to, fling, before, the, mark, they, also, use, bucklers, like, fighting, men, it, is, commonly, supposed, that, by, jactus, lapidum, fitzstephen, refers, to, an, early, variety, of, bowls, possibly, played, using, round, stone, there, is, a, record, of, iron, bowls, being, used, though, at, a, much, later, date, on, festive, occasions, at, nairn, on, the, other, hand, the, jactus, lapidum, of, which, he, speaks, may, have, been, more, akin, to, shot, put, it, is, clear, at, any, rate, that, a, rudimentary, form, of, the, game, was, played, in, england, in, the, 13th, century, a, manuscript, of, that, period, in, the, royal, library, windsor, no, 20, e, iv, contains, a, drawing, representing, two, players, aiming, at, a, small, cone, instead, of, an, earthenware, ball, or, jack, the, world, s, oldest, surviving, bowling, green, is, the, southampton, old, bowling, green, which, was, first, used, in, 1299, another, manuscript, of, the, same, century, has, a, crude, but, spirited, picture, which, brings, us, into, close, touch, with, the, existing, game, three, figures, are, introduced, and, a, jack, the, first, player, s, bowl, has, come, to, rest, just, in, front, of, the, jack, the, second, has, delivered, his, bowl, and, is, following, after, it, with, one, of, those, eccentric, contortions, still, not, unusual, on, modern, greens, the, first, player, meanwhile, making, a, repressive, gesture, with, his, hand, as, if, to, urge, the, bowl, to, stop, short, of, his, own, the, third, player, is, depicted, as, in, the, act, of, delivering, his, bowl, a, 14th, century, manuscript, book, of, prayers, in, the, francis, douce, collection, in, the, bodleian, library, at, oxford, contains, a, drawing, in, which, two, persons, are, shown, but, they, bowl, to, no, mark, strutt, sports, and, pastimes, suggests, that, the, first, player, s, bowl, may, have, been, regarded, by, the, second, player, as, a, species, of, jack, but, in, that, case, it, is, not, clear, what, was, the, first, player, s, target, in, these, three, earliest, illustrations, of, the, pastime, it, is, worth, noting, that, each, player, has, one, bowl, only, and, that, the, attitude, in, delivering, it, was, as, various, five, or, six, hundred, years, ago, as, it, is, today, in, the, third, he, stands, almost, upright, in, the, first, he, kneels, in, the, second, he, stoops, halfway, between, the, upright, and, the, kneeling, position, the, game, eventually, came, under, the, ban, of, king, and, parliament, both, fearing, it, might, jeopardise, the, practice, of, archery, then, so, important, in, battle, statutes, forbidding, it, and, other, sports, were, enacted, in, the, reigns, of, edward, iii, richard, ii, and, other, monarchs, even, when, on, the, invention, of, gunpowder, and, firearms, the, bow, had, fallen, into, disuse, as, a, weapon, of, war, the, prohibition, was, continued, the, discredit, attaching, to, bowling, alleys, first, established, in, london, in, 1455, probably, encouraged, subsequent, repressive, legislation, for, many, of, the, alleys, were, connected, with, taverns, frequented, by, the, dissolute, and, gamesters, erasmus, referred, to, the, game, as, globurum, the, name, of, bowls, is, implied, in, the, gerund, bowlyn, recorded, in, the, mid, 15th, century, the, term, bowl, for, wooden, ball, is, recorded, in, the, early, 1400s, the, name, is, explicitly, mentioned, as, bowles, in, a, list, of, unlawful, games, in, a, 1495, act, by, henry, vii, tenys, closshe, dise, cardes, bowles, it, occurs, again, in, a, similar, statute, by, henry, viii, 1511, by, a, further, act, the, unlawful, games, act, 1541, which, was, not, repealed, until, 1845, artificers, labourers, apprentices, servants, and, the, like, were, forbidden, to, play, bowls, at, any, time, except, christmas, and, then, only, in, their, master, s, house, and, presence, it, was, further, enjoined, that, any, one, playing, bowls, outside, his, own, garden, or, orchard, was, liable, to, a, penalty, of, 6s, 8d, 6, shillings, and, 8, pence, while, those, possessed, of, lands, of, the, yearly, value, of, 100, might, obtain, licences, to, play, on, their, own, private, greens, in, 1864, william, wallace, mitchell, 1803, 1884, a, glasgow, cotton, merchant, published, his, manual, of, bowls, playing, following, his, work, as, the, secretary, formed, in, 1849, by, scottish, bowling, clubs, which, became, the, basis, of, the, rules, of, the, modern, game, young, mitchell, was, only, 11, years, old, when, he, played, on, kilmarnock, bowling, green, the, oldest, club, in, scotland, instituted, in, 1740, the, patenting, of, the, first, lawn, mower, in, 1830, in, britain, is, strongly, believed, to, have, been, the, catalyst, for, the, worldwide, preparation, of, modern, style, greens, sporting, ovals, playing, fields, pitches, grass, courts, etc, this, in, turn, led, to, the, codification, of, modern, rules, for, many, sports, including, lawn, bowls, most, football, codes, lawn, tennis, and, others, national, bowling, associations, were, established, in, the, late, 1800s, in, the, then, victorian, colony, now, the, state, of, victoria, australia, the, royal, victorian, bowling, association, was, formed, in, 1880, the, scottish, bowling, association, was, established, in, 1892, although, there, had, been, a, failed, attempt, in, 1848, by, 200, scottish, clubs, today, bowls, is, played, in, over, 40, countries, with, more, than, 50, member, national, authorities, lawn, bowls, is, usually, played, on, a, large, rectangular, precisely, levelled, and, manicured, grass, or, synthetic, surface, known, as, a, bowling, green, which, is, divided, into, parallel, playing, strips, called, rinks, in, the, simplest, competition, singles, one, of, the, two, opponents, flips, a, coin, to, see, who, wins, the, mat, and, begins, a, segment, of, the, competition, in, bowling, parlance, an, end, by, placing, the, mat, and, rolling, the, jack, to, the, other, end, of, the, green, to, serve, as, a, target, once, it, has, come, to, rest, the, jack, is, aligned, to, the, centre, of, the, rink, and, the, players, take, turns, to, roll, their, bowls, from, the, mat, towards, the, jack, and, thereby, build, up, the, head, a, bowl, may, curve, outside, the, rink, boundary, on, its, path, but, must, come, to, rest, within, the, rink, boundary, to, remain, in, play, bowls, falling, into, the, ditch, are, dead, and, removed, from, play, except, in, the, event, when, one, has, touched, the, jack, on, its, way, touchers, are, marked, with, chalk, and, remain, alive, in, play, even, if, they, get, into, the, ditch, similarly, if, the, jack, is, knocked, into, the, ditch, it, is, still, alive, unless, it, is, out, of, bounds, to, the, side, resulting, in, a, dead, end, which, is, replayed, though, according, to, international, rules, the, jack, is, respotted, to, the, centre, of, the, rink, and, the, end, is, continued, after, each, competitor, has, delivered, all, of, their, bowls, four, each, in, singles, and, pairs, three, each, in, triples, and, two, bowls, each, in, fours, the, distance, of, the, closest, bowls, to, the, jack, is, determined, the, jack, may, have, been, displaced, and, points, called, shots, are, awarded, for, each, bowl, which, a, competitor, has, closer, than, the, opponent, s, nearest, to, the, jack, for, instance, if, a, competitor, has, bowled, two, bowls, closer, to, the, jack, than, their, opponent, s, nearest, they, are, awarded, two, shots, the, exercise, is, then, repeated, for, the, next, end, a, game, of, bowls, typically, being, of, twenty, one, ends, lawn, bowls, is, played, on, grass, and, variations, from, green, to, green, are, common, greens, come, in, all, shapes, and, sizes, the, most, common, are, fast, slow, big, crown, small, crown, bowls, is, generally, played, in, a, very, good, spirit, even, at, the, highest, professional, level, acknowledgment, of, opponents, successes, and, near, misses, being, quite, normal, scoring, systems, vary, from, competition, to, competition, games, can, be, decided, when, games, to, a, specified, number, of, ends, may, also, be, drawn, the, draw, may, stand, or, the, opponents, may, be, required, to, play, an, extra, end, to, decide, the, winner, these, provisions, are, always, published, beforehand, in, the, event, s, conditions, of, play, in, the, laws, of, the, sport, of, bowls, the, winner, in, a, singles, game, is, the, first, player, to, score, 21, shots, in, all, other, disciplines, pairs, triples, fours, the, winner, is, the, team, who, has, scored, the, most, shots, after, 21, 25, ends, of, play, often, local, tournaments, will, play, shorter, games, often, 10, or, 12, ends, some, competitions, use, a, set, scoring, system, with, the, first, to, seven, points, awarded, a, set, in, a, best, of, three, or, best, of, five, set, match, as, well, as, singles, competition, there, can, be, two, pairs, three, triples, and, four, player, fours, teams, in, these, teams, bowl, alternately, with, each, player, within, a, team, bowling, all, their, bowls, then, handing, over, to, the, next, player, the, team, captain, or, skip, always, plays, last, and, is, instrumental, in, directing, his, team, s, shots, and, tactics, the, current, method, of, scoring, in, the, professional, tour, world, bowls, tour, is, sets, each, set, consists, of, nine, ends, and, the, player, with, the, most, shots, at, the, end, of, a, set, wins, the, set, if, the, score, is, tied, the, set, is, halved, if, a, player, wins, two, sets, or, gets, a, win, and, a, tie, that, player, wins, the, game, if, each, player, wins, a, set, or, both, sets, end, tied, there, is, a, 3, end, tiebreaker, to, determine, a, winner, bowls, are, designed, to, travel, a, curved, path, because, of, a, weight, bias, which, was, originally, produced, by, inserting, weights, in, one, side, of, the, bowl, the, word, bias, itself, is, recorded, as, a, technical, term, of, the, game, in, the, 1560s, the, insertion, of, weights, is, no, longer, permitted, by, the, rules, and, bias, is, now, produced, entirely, by, the, shape, of, the, bowl, a, bowler, determines, the, bias, direction, of, the, bowl, in, his, hand, by, a, dimple, or, symbol, on, one, side, regulations, determine, the, minimum, bias, allowed, and, the, range, of, diameters, 11, 6, to, 13, 1, cm, 4, 6, to, 5, 2, in, but, within, these, rules, bowlers, can, and, do, choose, bowls, to, suit, their, own, preference, they, were, originally, made, from, lignum, vitae, a, dense, wood, giving, rise, to, the, term, woods, for, bowls, but, are, now, more, typically, made, of, a, hard, plastic, composite, material, bowls, were, once, only, available, coloured, black, or, brown, but, they, are, now, available, in, a, variety, of, colours, they, have, unique, symbol, markings, engraved, on, them, for, identification, since, many, bowls, look, the, same, coloured, adhesive, stickers, or, labels, are, also, used, to, mark, the, bowls, of, each, team, in, bowls, matches, some, local, associations, agree, on, specific, colours, for, stickers, for, each, of, the, clubs, in, their, area, provincial, or, national, colours, are, often, assigned, in, national, and, international, competitions, these, stickers, are, used, by, officials, to, distinguish, teams, bowls, have, symbols, unique, to, the, set, of, four, for, identification, the, side, of, the, bowl, with, a, larger, symbol, within, a, circle, indicates, the, side, away, from, the, bias, that, side, with, a, smaller, symbol, within, a, smaller, circle, is, the, bias, side, toward, which, the, bowl, will, turn, it, is, not, uncommon, for, players, to, deliver, a, wrong, bias, shot, from, time, to, time, and, see, their, carefully, aimed, bowl, crossing, neighbouring, rinks, rather, than, heading, towards, their, jack, when, bowling, there, are, several, types, of, delivery, draw, shots, are, those, where, the, bowl, is, rolled, to, a, specific, location, without, causing, too, much, disturbance, of, bowls, already, in, the, head, for, a, right, handed, bowler, forehand, draw, or, finger, peg, is, initially, aimed, to, the, right, of, the, jack, and, curves, in, to, the, left, the, same, bowler, can, deliver, a, backhand, draw, or, thumb, peg, by, turning, the, bowl, over, in, his, hand, and, curving, it, the, opposite, way, from, left, to, right, in, both, cases, the, bowl, is, rolled, as, close, to, the, jack, as, possible, unless, tactics, demand, otherwise, a, drive, or, fire, or, strike, involves, bowling, with, force, with, the, aim, of, knocking, either, the, jack, or, a, specific, bowl, out, of, play, and, with, the, drive, s, speed, there, is, virtually, no, noticeable, or, at, least, much, less, curve, on, the, shot, an, upshot, or, yard, on, shot, involves, delivering, the, bowl, with, an, extra, degree, of, weight, often, referred, to, as, controlled, weight, or, rambler, enough, to, displace, the, jack, or, disturb, other, bowls, in, the, head, without, killing, the, end, a, block, shot, is, one, that, is, intentionally, placed, short, to, defend, from, a, drive, or, to, stop, an, oppositions, draw, shot, the, challenge, in, all, these, shots, is, to, be, able, to, adjust, line, and, length, accordingly, the, faster, the, delivery, the, narrower, the, line, or, green, particularly, in, team, competition, there, can, be, a, large, number, of, bowls, on, the, green, towards, the, conclusion, of, the, end, and, this, gives, rise, to, complex, tactics, teams, holding, shot, with, the, closest, bowl, will, often, make, their, subsequent, shots, not, with, the, goal, of, placing, the, bowl, near, the, jack, but, in, positions, to, make, it, difficult, for, opponents, to, get, their, bowls, into, the, head, or, to, places, where, the, jack, might, be, deflected, to, if, the, opponent, attempts, to, disturb, the, head, there, are, many, different, ways, to, set, up, the, game, crown, green, bowling, utilises, the, entire, green, a, player, can, send, the, jack, anywhere, on, the, green, in, this, game, and, the, green, itself, is, more, akin, to, a, golf, green, with, much, undulation, it, is, played, with, only, two, woods, each, the, jack, also, has, a, bias, and, is, only, slightly, smaller, than, the, woods, at, the, amateur, level, it, is, usual, for, several, ends, to, be, played, simultaneously, on, one, green, if, two, moving, woods, meet, both, are, taken, back, and, the, shots, replayed, if, a, moving, wood, strikes, a, stationary, wood, or, jack, from, another, end, it, is, again, taken, back, and, replayed, but, the, bowl, struck, is, replaced, where, contact, took, place, the, game, is, played, usually, to, 21, up, in, singles, and, doubles, format, with, some, competitions, playing, to, 31, up, the, panel, professional, crown, green, bowls, is, played, at, the, red, lion, bowling, green, westhoughton, daily, and, is, played, to, 41, up, with, greenside, betting, throughout, play, the, green, was, formerly, owned, by, the, pub, now, demolished, but, was, purchased, in, 2007, by, the, panel, who, paid, the, brewery, 12, 000, for, the, renowned, green, and, its, surrounds, singles, triples, and, fours, and, australian, pairs, are, some, ways, the, game, can, be, played, in, singles, two, people, play, against, each, other, and, the, first, to, reach, 21, 25, or, 31, shots, as, decided, by, the, controlling, body, is, the, winner, in, one, variation, of, singles, play, each, player, uses, two, bowls, only, and, the, game, is, played, over, 21, ends, a, player, concedes, the, game, before, the, 21st, end, if, the, score, difference, is, such, that, it, is, impossible, to, draw, equal, or, win, within, the, 21, ends, if, the, score, is, equal, after, 21, ends, an, extra, end, is, played, to, decide, the, winner, an, additional, scoring, method, is, set, play, this, comprises, two, sets, over, nine, ends, should, a, player, win, a, set, each, they, then, play, a, further, 3, ends, that, will, decide, the, winner, pairs, allows, both, people, on, a, team, to, play, skip, and, lead, the, lead, throws, two, bowls, the, skip, delivers, two, then, the, lead, delivers, his, remaining, two, the, skip, then, delivers, his, remaining, two, bowls, each, end, the, leads, and, skips, switch, positions, this, is, played, over, 21, ends, or, sets, play, triples, is, with, three, players, while, fours, is, with, four, players, in, each, team, and, is, played, over, 21, ends, another, pairs, variation, is, 242, pairs, also, known, as, australian, pairs, in, the, first, end, of, the, game, the, a, players, lead, off, with, 2, bowls, each, then, the, b, players, play, 4, bowls, each, before, the, a, players, complete, the, end, with, their, final, 2, bowls, the, a, players, act, as, lead, and, skip, in, the, same, end, in, the, second, end, the, roles, are, reversed, with, the, a, players, being, in, the, middle, this, alternating, pattern, continues, through, the, game, which, is, typically, over, 15, ends, short, mat, bowls, is, an, all, year, sport, unaffected, by, weather, conditions, and, it, does, not, require, a, permanent, location, as, the, rink, mats, can, be, rolled, up, and, stowed, away, this, makes, it, particularly, appropriate, for, small, communities, as, it, can, be, played, in, village, halls, schools, sports, and, social, clubs, bowls, are, played, by, the, blind, and, paraplegic, blind, bowlers, are, extremely, skillful, a, string, is, run, out, down, the, centre, of, the, lane, and, wherever, the, jack, lands, it, is, moved, across, to, the, string, and, the, length, is, called, out, by, a, sighted, marker, when, the, woods, are, sent, the, distance, from, the, jack, is, called, out, in, yards, feet, and, inches, the, position, in, relation, to, the, jack, is, given, using, the, clock, 12, 00, is, behind, the, jack, in, the, province, of, west, flanders, and, surrounding, regions, tra, bowls, is, the, most, popular, variation, of, bowls, as, opposed, to, playing, it, on, a, flat, or, uneven, terrain, the, terrain, is, made, smooth, but, hollow, tra, just, means, hollow, road, in, flemish, the, hollow, road, causes, the, path, to, be, curving, even, more, the, balls, are, biased, in, the, same, way, as, the, lawn, bowls, balls, but, with, a, diameter, of, about, 20, cm, 7, 9, in, a, thickness, of, 12, cm, 4, 7, in, and, a, weight, of, about, 2, kg, 4, 4, lb, they, are, a, bit, bigger, than, usual, bowls, the, target, is, an, unmovable, feather, or, metal, plate, on, the, ground, instead, of, a, small, ball, the, length, of, the, tra, is, about, 18, m, 59, ft, the, scoring, is, also, different, as, a, point, is, awarded, for, every, shot, that, brings, the, ball, closer, to, the, target, than, any, opponent, s, ball, this, causes, pure, blocking, strategies, to, be, less, effective, in, 1972, the, west, flemish, tra,
