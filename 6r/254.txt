maiden, or, virgin, the, words, virgino, female, virgin, and, virgulo, literally, virgin, person, but, often, used, for, a, male, virgin, are, hyponyms, the, latin, word, likely, arose, by, analogy, with, a, suit, of, lexemes, based, on, vireo, meaning, to, be, green, fresh, or, flourishing, mostly, with, botanic, reference, in, particular, virga, meaning, strip, of, wood, the, first, known, use, of, virgin, in, english, is, found, in, a, middle, english, manuscript, held, at, trinity, college, cambridge, of, about, 1200, ar, haue, martirs, and, confessors, and, uirgines, maked, faier, bode, inne, to, women, in, this, and, many, later, contexts, the, reference, is, specifically, christian, alluding, to, members, of, the, ordo, virginum, order, of, virgins, which, applies, to, the, consecrated, virgins, known, to, have, existed, since, the, early, church, from, the, writings, of, the, church, fathers, by, about, 1300, the, word, was, expanded, to, apply, also, to, mary, the,

for, sexual, inexperience, as, frau, means, woman, it, suggests, a, female, referent, unlike, english, german, also, has, a, specific, word, for, a, male, virgin, j, ngling, youngling, it, is, however, dated, and, rarely, used, jungfrau, with, some, masculine, modifier, is, more, typical, as, evidenced, by, the, film, the, 40, year, old, virgin, about, a, 40, year, old, male, virgin,

like, english, it, is, also, applied, to, men, in, both, cases, specifically, denoting, absence, of, sexual, experience, when, used, of, men, it, does, not, carry, a, strong, association, of, never, married, status, however, in, reference, to, women, historically, it, was, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, an, engaged, woman, parthenos, autou, his, virgin, his, fianc, e, as, opposed, to, gun, autou, his, woman, his, wife, this, distinction, is, necessary, due, to, there, being, no, specific, word, for, wife, or, husband, in, greek, by, extension, from, its, primary, sense, the, idea, that, a, virgin, has, a, sexual, blank, slate, unchanged, by, any, past, intimate, connection, or, experience, can, imply, that, the, person, is, of, unadulterated, purity, the, english, sense, is, not,

lure, due, to, her, implied, purity, the, topic, is, popular, in, renaissance, paintings, although, virginity, has, historically, been, correlated, with, purity, and, worth, many, feminist, scholars, believe, that, virginity, itself, is, a, myth, they, argue, that, no, standardized, medical, definition, of, virginity, exists, that, there, is, no, scientifically, verifiable, proof, of, virginity, loss, and, that, sexual, intercourse, results, in, no, change, in, personality, jessica, valenti, feminist, writer, and, author, of, the, purity, myth, reasons, that, the, concept, of, virginity, is, also, dubious, because, of, the, many, individual, definitions, of, virginity, loss, and, that, valuing, virginity, has, placed, a, woman, s, morality, between, her, legs, she, critiques, the, notion, that, sexual, activity, has, any, influence, on, morality, or, ethics, the, urge, of, wanting, one, s, spouse, or, partner, to, have, never, engaged, in, sexual, activities, is, called, a, virgin, complex, a, person, may, also, have, a, virgin, complex, directed, towards, oneself, there, are, varying, understandings, as, to, which, types, of, sexual, activities, result, in, loss, of, virginity, the, traditional, view, is, that, virginity, is, only, lost, through, vaginal, penetration, by, the, penis, consensual, or, non, consensual, and, that, acts, of, oral, sex, anal, sex, manual, sex, or, other, forms, of, non, penetrative, sex, do, not, result, in, loss, of, virginity, a, person, who, engages, in, such, acts, without, having, engaged, in, vaginal, intercourse, is, often, regarded, among, heterosexuals, and, researchers, as, technically, a, virgin, by, contrast, gay, or, lesbian, individuals, often, describe, such, acts, as, resulting, in, loss, of, virginity, some, gay, males, regard, penile, anal, penetration, as, resulting, in, loss, of, virginity, but, not, fellatio, handjobs, or, other, types, of, non, penetrative, sex, while, lesbians, may, regard, cunnilingus, or, fingering, as, virginity, loss, some, lesbians, who, debate, the, traditional, definition, consider, whether, or, not, non, penile, forms, of, vaginal, penetration, constitute, virginity, loss, while, other, gay, men, and, lesbians, assert, that, the, term, virginity, is, meaningless, to, them, because, of, the, prevalence, of, the, traditional, definition, whether, a, person, can, lose, their, virginity, through, rape, is, also, subject, to, debate, with, the, belief, that, virginity, can, only, be, lost, through, consensual, sex, being, prevalent, in, some, studies, in, a, study, by, researcher, and, author, laura, m, carpenter, many, men, and, women, discussed, how, they, felt, virginity, could, not, be, taken, through, rape, they, described, losing, their, virginities, in, one, of, three, ways, as, a, gift, stigma, or, part, of, the, process, carpenter, states, that, despite, perceptions, of, what, determines, virginity, loss, being, as, varied, among, gay, men, and, lesbians, as, they, are, among, heterosexuals, and, in, some, cases, more, varied, among, the, former, that, the, matter, has, been, described, to, her, as, people, viewing, sexual, acts, relating, to, virginity, loss, as, acts, that, correspond, to, your, sexual, orientation, which, suggests, the, following, so, if, you, re, a, gay, male, you, re, supposed, to, have, anal, sex, because, that, s, what, gay, men, do, and, if, you, re, a, gay, woman, then, you, re, supposed, to, have, oral, sex, because, that, s, what, gay, women, do, and, so, those, become, like, markers, for, when, virginity, is, lost, the, concept, of, technical, virginity, or, sexual, abstinence, through, oral, sex, is, popular, among, teenagers, for, example, oral, sex, is, common, among, adolescent, girls, who, fellate, their, boyfriends, not, only, to, preserve, their, virginity, but, also, to, create, and, maintain, intimacy, or, to, avoid, pregnancy, in, a, 1999, study, published, in, jama, the, journal, of, the, american, medical, association, the, definition, of, sex, was, examined, based, on, a, 1991, random, sample, of, 599, college, students, from, 29, us, states, it, found, that, 60, said, oral, genital, contact, like, fellatio, cunnilingus, did, not, constitute, having, sex, stephanie, sanders, of, the, kinsey, institute, co, author, of, the, study, stated, that, s, the, technical, virginity, thing, that, s, going, on, she, and, other, researchers, titled, their, findings, would, you, say, you, had, sex, if, by, contrast, in, a, study, released, in, 2008, by, the, guttmacher, institute, author, of, the, findings, laura, lindberg, stated, that, there, is, a, widespread, belief, that, teens, engage, in, nonvaginal, forms, of, sex, especially, oral, sex, as, a, way, to, be, sexually, active, while, still, claiming, that, technically, they, are, virgins, but, that, her, study, drew, the, conclusion, that, research, shows, that, this, supposed, substitution, of, oral, sex, for, vaginal, sex, is, largely, a, myth, a, 2003, study, published, in, the, canadian, journal, of, human, sexuality, focusing, on, definitions, of, having, sex, and, noting, studies, concerning, university, students, from, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, australia, reported, that, hile, the, vast, majority, of, respondents, more, than, 97, in, these, three, studies, included, penile, vaginal, intercourse, in, their, definition, of, sex, fewer, between, 70, and, 90, respondents, considered, penile, anal, intercourse, to, constitute, having, sex, and, that, oral, genital, behaviours, were, defined, as, sex, by, between, 32, and, 58, of, respondents, a, different, study, by, the, kinsey, institute, sampled, 484, people, ranging, in, ages, 18, 96, nearly, 95, percent, of, people, in, the, study, agreed, that, penile, vaginal, intercourse, meant, had, sex, but, the, numbers, changed, as, the, questions, got, more, specific, 11, percent, of, respondents, based, had, sex, on, whether, the, man, had, achieved, an, orgasm, concluding, that, absence, of, an, orgasm, does, not, constitute, having, had, sex, about, 80, percent, of, respondents, said, penile, anal, intercourse, meant, had, sex, about, 70, percent, of, people, believed, oral, sex, was, sex, virginity, pledges, or, abstinence, pledges, made, by, heterosexual, teenagers, and, young, adults, may, also, include, the, practice, of, technical, virginity, in, a, peer, reviewed, study, by, sociologists, peter, bearman, and, hannah, brueckner, which, looked, at, virginity, pledgers, five, years, after, their, pledge, they, found, that, the, pledgers, have, similar, proportions, of, sexually, transmitted, diseases, stds, and, at, least, as, high, proportions, of, anal, and, oral, sex, as, those, who, have, not, made, a, virginity, pledge, and, deduced, that, there, was, substitution, of, oral, and, anal, sex, for, vaginal, sex, among, the, pledgers, however, the, data, for, anal, sex, without, vaginal, sex, reported, by, males, did, not, reflect, this, directly, early, loss, of, virginity, has, been, shown, to, be, linked, to, factors, such, as, level, of, education, independence, biological, factors, like, age, and, gender, and, social, factors, such, as, parental, supervision, or, religious, affiliation, with, the, most, common, being, sociodemographic, variables, along, with, this, sexual, abuse, has, also, been, shown, to, have, a, link, to, later, risky, sexual, behaviors, and, a, younger, age, of, voluntary, sexual, intercourse, sexual, initiation, at, an, earlier, age, has, been, associated, with, less, frequency, of, condom, use, less, satisfaction, and, more, frequency, of, non, autonomous, reasons, for, that, first, sexual, encounter, adverse, effects, for, losing, virginity, at, an, early, age, include, lower, chance, of, economic, stability, lower, level, of, education, social, isolation, marital, disruption, and, greater, medical, consequences, these, medical, consequences, consist, of, an, increase, in, stds, cervical, cancer, pelvic, inflammatory, disease, fertility, and, unwanted, pregnancies, the, first, act, of, sexual, intercourse, by, a, female, is, commonly, considered, within, many, cultures, to, be, an, important, personal, milestone, its, significance, is, reflected, in, expressions, such, as, saving, oneself, losing, one, s, virginity, taking, someone, s, virginity, and, sometimes, as, deflowering, the, occasion, is, at, times, seen, as, the, end, of, innocence, integrity, or, purity, and, the, sexualization, of, the, individual, traditionally, there, was, a, cultural, expectation, that, a, female, would, not, engage, in, premarital, sex, and, would, come, to, her, wedding, a, virgin, and, that, she, would, give, up, her, virginity, to, her, new, husband, in, the, act, of, consummation, of, the, marriage, feminine, sexual, practices, have, revolved, around, the, idea, of, females, waiting, to, have, sex, until, they, are, married, some, females, who, have, been, previously, sexually, active, or, their, hymen, has, been, otherwise, damaged, may, undergo, a, surgical, procedure, called, hymenorrhaphy, or, hymenoplasty, to, repair, or, replace, her, hymen, and, cause, vaginal, bleeding, on, the, next, intercourse, as, proof, of, virginity, see, below, in, some, cultures, an, unmarried, female, who, is, found, not, to, be, a, virgin, whether, by, choice, or, as, a, result, of, a, rape, can, be, subject, to, shame, ostracism, or, even, an, honor, killing, in, those, cultures, female, virginity, is, closely, interwoven, with, personal, or, even, family, honor, especially, those, known, as, shame, societies, in, which, the, loss, of, virginity, before, marriage, is, a, matter, of, deep, shame, in, some, parts, of, africa, the, myth, that, sex, with, a, virgin, can, cure, hiv, aids, continues, to, prevail, leading, to, girls, and, women, being, raped, in, other, societies, such, as, many, modern, day, western, cultures, lack, of, sexual, abstinence, before, marriage, is, not, as, socially, stigmatized, as, it, may, be, in, the, formerly, mentioned, cultures, virginity, is, regarded, as, a, valuable, commodity, in, some, cultures, in, the, past, within, most, societies, a, woman, s, options, for, marriage, were, largely, dependent, upon, her, status, as, a, virgin, those, women, who, were, not, virgins, experienced, a, dramatic, decrease, in, opportunities, for, a, socially, advantageous, marriage, and, in, some, instances, the, premarital, loss, of, virginity, eliminated, their, chances, of, marriage, entirely, modern, virginity, auctions, like, that, of, natalie, dylan, are, discussed, in, the, 2013, documentary, how, to, lose, your, virginity, the, bible, required, a, man, who, had, sex, with, a, virgin, to, pay, her, bride, price, to, her, father, and, marry, the, girl, in, some, countries, until, the, late, 20th, century, a, woman, could, sue, a, man, who, had, taken, her, virginity, but, did, not, marry, her, in, some, languages, the, compensation, for, these, damages, are, called, wreath, money, despite, common, cultural, beliefs, links, between, hymen, state, and, vaginal, penetration, are, not, clear, cut, inserting, objects, including, penises, into, the, vagina, may, or, may, not, affect, the, hymen, the, state, of, a, hymen, cannot, be, used, to, prove, or, disprove, virginity, penile, penetration, does, not, lead, to, predictable, changes, to, female, genital, organs, after, puberty, hymens, are, highly, elastic, and, can, stretch, during, penetration, without, trace, of, injury, females, with, a, confirmed, history, of, sexual, abuse, involving, genital, penetration, may, have, normal, hymens, young, females, who, say, they, have, had, consensual, sex, mostly, show, no, identifiable, changes, in, the, hymen, hymens, rarely, completely, cover, the, vagina, hymens, naturally, have, irregularities, in, width, and, hymens, can, heal, spontaneously, without, scarring, visible, breaks, in, the, hymen, including, complete, hymenal, clefts, are, also, common, in, girls, and, women, who, have, never, been, sexually, active, medical, professionals, therefore, recommend, against, describing, hymens, as, intact, or, broken, some, cultures, require, proof, of, a, bride, s, virginity, before, her, marriage, this, has, traditionally, been, tested, by, inspection, for, an, intact, hymen, or, by, a, proof, of, blood, which, refers, to, vaginal, bleeding, wrongly, believed, to, be, caused, by, the, tearing, of, the, hymen, after, the, first, sanctioned, sexual, contact, coerced, medical, virginity, tests, are, practiced, in, many, regions, of, the, world, but, are, today, condemned, as, a, form, of, abuse, of, women, according, to, the, world, health, organization, who, sexual, violence, encompasses, a, wide, range, of, acts, including, violent, acts, against, the, sexual, integrity, of, women, including, female, genital, mutilation, and, obligatory, inspections, for, virginity, although, it, is, not, actually, possible, to, determine, virginity, by, inspection, some, doctors, feel, socially, pressured, into, performing, virginity, testing, inspections, and, providing, certificates, of, virginity, in, some, jurisdictions, this, is, illegal, and, physicianas, are, encouraged, to, instead, provide, education, guidance, social, support, and, where, needed, physical, protection, such, virginity, testing, bans, have, been, controversial, while, there, is, a, consensus, that, virginity, cannot, be, scientifically, and, medically, certified, some, physicians, argue, that, certificates, while, intrinsically, dishonest, protect, vulnerable, women, from, potentially, life, threatening, danger, some, women, undergo, hymenorrhaphy, or, hymenoplasty, to, reshape, their, hymens, with, the, intent, of, causing, vaginal, bleeding, on, the, next, intercourse, hymenorraphy, is, based, on, the, false, belief, that, all, women, bleed, when, first, having, vaginal, intercourse, in, fact, only, about, half, bleed, in, some, cultures, the, nuptial, blood, spotted, bed, sheet, would, be, displayed, as, proof, of, both, consummation, of, marriage, and, that, the, bride, had, been, a, virgin, hymens, have, few, blood, vessels, and, may, not, bleed, significantly, even, when, torn, and, vaginal, walls, may, bleed, significantly, when, torn, blood, on, the, sheets, on, first, intercourse, is, more, likely, to, be, due, to, lacerations, to, the, vaginal, wall, caused, by, inadequate, vaginal, lubrication, or, forced, penetration, a, small, study, found, that, of, 19, women, who, underwent, hymenorrhaphy, 17, did, not, have, bleeding, at, the, next, intercourse, in, iran, grand, ayatollah, sayyid, sadeq, rohani, has, issued, a, fatwa, which, states, that, a, women, after, undergoing, hymenorrhaphy, is, a, virgin, and, a, man, cannot, divorce, her, on, grounds, that, she, was, not, hymenorraphy, is, considered, a, form, of, cosmetic, surgery, and, is, not, generally, accepted, taught, or, regulated, by, the, medical, profession, there, is, a, common, belief, that, some, women, are, born, without, a, hymen, but, some, doubt, has, been, cast, on, this, by, a, recent, study, it, is, likely, that, almost, all, women, are, born, with, a, hymen, but, most, will, not, experience, a, measurable, change, during, first, experience, of, vaginal, intercourse, some, medical, procedures, occasionally, may, require, a, woman, s, hymen, to, be, opened, hymenotomy, historically, and, in, modern, times, female, virginity, has, been, regarded, as, more, significant, than, male, virginity, the, perception, that, sexual, prowess, is, fundamental, to, masculinity, has, lowered, the, expectation, of, male, virginity, without, lowering, social, status, for, example, in, mataram, indonesia, where, around, 80, of, the, population, are, muslims, unmarried, women, who, are, not, virgins, may, be, subject, to, name, calling, shunning, or, family, shame, while, unmarried, men, who, have, lost, their, virginities, are, not, though, premarital, sex, is, forbidden, in, the, quran, with, regard, to, both, men, and, women, among, various, countries, or, cultures, males, are, expected, or, encouraged, to, want, to, engage, in, sexual, activity, and, to, be, more, sexually, experienced, not, following, these, standards, often, leads, to, teasing, and, other, such, ridicule, from, their, male, peers, a, 2003, study, by, the, guttmacher, institute, showed, that, in, the, countries, surveyed, most, men, have, experienced, sexual, intercourse, by, their, 20th, birthdays, male, sexuality, is, seen, as, something, that, is, innate, and, competitive, and, displays, a, different, set, of, cultural, values, and, stigmas, from, female, sexuality, and, virginity, in, one, study, scholars, wenger, and, berger, found, that, male, virginity, is, understood, to, be, real, by, society, but, it, has, been, ignored, by, sociological, studies, within, british, and, american, culture, in, particular, male, virginity, has, been, made, an, object, of, embarrassment, and, ridicule, in, films, such, as, summer, of, 42, american, pie, the, inbetweeners, movie, and, the, 40, year, old, virgin, with, the, male, virgin, typically, being, presented, as, socially, inept, such, attitudes, have, resulted, in, some, men, keeping, their, status, as, a, virgin, a, secret, the, prevalence, of, virginity, varies, from, culture, to, culture, in, cultures, which, place, importance, on, a, female, s, virginity, at, marriage, the, age, at, which, virginity, is, lost, is, in, effect, determined, by, the, age, at, which, marriages, would, normally, take, place, in, those, cultures, as, well, as, the, minimum, marriage, age, set, by, the, laws, of, the, country, where, the, marriage, takes, place, in, a, cross, cultural, study, at, what, age, do, women, and, men, have, their, first, sexual, intercourse, 2003, michael, bozon, of, the, french, institut, national, d, tudes, d, mographiques, found, that, contemporary, cultures, fall, into, three, broad, categories, in, the, first, group, the, data, indicated, families, arranging, marriage, for, daughters, as, close, to, puberty, as, possible, with, significantly, older, men, age, of, men, at, sexual, initiation, in, these, societies, is, at, later, ages, than, that, of, women, but, is, often, extra, marital, this, group, included, sub, saharan, africa, the, study, listed, mali, senegal, and, ethiopia, the, study, considered, the, indian, subcontinent, to, also, fall, into, this, group, although, data, was, only, available, from, nepal, in, the, second, group, the, data, indicated, families, encouraged, daughters, to, delay, marriage, and, to, abstain, from, sexual, activity, before, that, time, however, sons, are, encouraged, to, gain, experience, with, older, women, or, prostitutes, before, marriage, age, of, men, at, sexual, initiation, in, these, societies, is, at, lower, ages, than, that, of, women, this, group, includes, latin, cultures, both, from, southern, europe, portugal, greece, and, romania, are, noted, and, from, latin, america, brazil, chile, and, the, dominican, republic, the, study, considered, many, asian, societies, to, also, fall, into, this, group, although, matching, data, was, only, available, from, thailand, in, the, third, group, age, of, men, and, women, at, sexual, initiation, was, more, closely, matched, there, were, two, sub, groups, however, in, non, latin, catholic, countries, poland, and, lithuania, are, mentioned, age, at, sexual, initiation, was, higher, suggesting, later, marriage, and, reciprocal, valuing, of, male, and, female, virginity, the, same, pattern, of, late, marriage, and, reciprocal, valuing, of, virginity, was, reflected, in, singapore, and, sri, lanka, the, study, considered, china, and, vietnam, to, also, fall, into, this, group, although, data, were, not, available, finally, in, northern, and, eastern, european, countries, age, at, sexual, initiation, was, lower, with, both, men, and, women, involved, in, sexual, activity, before, any, union, formation, the, study, listed, switzerland, germany, and, the,

they, felt, things, were, moving, too, fast, sexually, and, 24, had, done, something, sexual, they, didn, t, really, want, to, do, several, polls, have, indicated, peer, pressure, as, a, factor, in, encouraging, both, girls, and, boys, to, have, sex, some, studies, suggest, that, people, commence, sexual, activity, at, an, earlier, age, than, previous, generations, the, 2005, durex, global, sex, survey, found, that, people, worldwide, are, having, sex, for, the, first, time, at, an, average, age, of, 17, 3, ranging, from, 15, 6, in, iceland, to, 19, 8, in, india, though, evidence, has, shown, that, the, average, age, is, not, a, good, indicator, of, sexual, initiation, and, that, percentages, of, sexually, initiated, youth, at, each, age, are, preferred, a, 2008, survey, of, uk, teenagers, between, the, ages, of, 14, and, 17, conducted, by, yougov, for, channel, 4, showed, that, only, 6, of, these, teenagers, intended, to, wait, until, marriage, before, having, sex, according, to, a, 2011, cdc, study, in, the, 15, to, 19, year, old, age, group, 43, percent, of, males, and, 48, percent, of, females, in, the, united, states, reported, never, having, an, opposite, sex, partner, the, rates, of, teenage, pregnancy, vary, and, range, from, 143, per, 1000, girls, in, some, sub, saharan, african, countries, to, 2, 9, per, 1000, in, south, korea, the, rate, for, the, united, states, is, 52, 1, per, 1000, the, highest, in, the, developed, world, and, about, four, times, the, european, union, average, the, teenage, pregnancy, rates, between, countries, must, take, into, account, the, level, of, general, sex, education, available, and, access, to, contraceptive, options, many, western, countries, have, instituted, sex, education, programs, the, main, objective, of, which, is, to, reduce, such, pregnancies, and, stds, in, 1996, the, united, states, federal, government, shifted, the, objective, of, sex, education, towards, abstinence, only, sex, education, programs, promoting, sexual, abstinence, before, marriage, i, e, virginity, and, prohibiting, information, on, birth, control, and, contraception, in, 2004, president, george, w, bush, announced, a, five, year, global, hiv, aids, strategy, also, known, as, the, president, s, emergency, plan, for, aids, relief, pepfar, which, committed, the, u, s, to, provide, 15, billion, over, five, years, toward, aids, relief, in, 15, countries, in, africa, and, the, caribbean, and, in, vietnam, a, part, of, the, funding, was, earmarked, specifically, for, abstinence, only, until, marriage, programs, in, one, study, about, virginity, pledges, male, pledgers, were, 4, 1, times, more, likely, to, remain, virgins, by, age, 25, than, those, who, did, not, pledge, 25, vs, 6, and, estimated, that, female, pledgers, were, 3, 5, times, more, likely, to, remain, virgins, by, age, 25, than, those, who, did, not, pledge, 21, vs, 6, some, cultural, anthropologists, argue, that, romantic, love, and, sexual, jealousy, are, universal, features, of, human, relationships, social, values, related, to, virginity, reflect, both, sexual, jealousy, and, ideals, of, romantic, love, and, appear, to, be, deeply, embedded, in,

kathryn, london, studied, u, s, women, married, between, 1965, and, 1985, to, see, if, virginity, at, marriage, influenced, risk, of, divorce, in, this, study, women, who, were, virgins, at, the, time, of, marriage, were, shown, to, have, less, marital, upset, it, was, shown, that, when, observable, characteristics, were, controlled, women, who, were, non, virgins, at, the, time, of, marriage, had, a, higher, risk, for, divorce, however, it, was, also, shown, that, the, link, between, premarital, sex, and, the, risk, of, divorce, were, attributed, to, prior, unobserved, differences, such, as, deviating, from, norms, a, study, conducted, by, smith, and, schaffer, found, that, someone, s, first, sexual, experience, has, been, linked, to, their, sexual, performance, for, years, to, come, participants, whose, first, intercourse, was, pleasant, showed, more, satisfaction, in, their, current, sex, lives, a, different, study, showed, that, when, compared, with, virgins, nonvirgins, have, been, shown, to, have, higher, levels, of, independence, less, desire, for, achievement, more, criticism, from, society, and, a, greater, level, of, deviance, human, sexual, activity, like, many, other, kinds, of, activity, engaged, in, by, humans, is, generally, influenced, by, social, rules, that, are, culturally, specific, and, vary, widely, these, social, rules, are, referred, to, as, sexual, morality, what, can, and, can, not, be, done, by, society, s, rules, and, sexual, norms, what, is, and, is, not, expected, there, are, a, number, of, groups, within, societies, promoting, their, views, of, sexual, morality, in, a, variety, of, ways, including, through, sex, education, religious, teachings, seeking, commitments, or, virginity, pledges, and, other, means, most, countries, have, laws, which, set, a, minimum, marriage, age, with, the, most, common, age, being, 18, years, reduced, to, 16, in, special, circumstances, typically, when, the, female, partner, is, pregnant, but, the, actual, age, at, first, marriage, can, be, considerably, higher, laws, also, prescribe, the, minimum, age, at, which, a, person, is, permitted, to, engage, in, sex, commonly, called, the, age, of, consent, social, and, legal, attitudes, toward, the, appropriate, age, of, consent, have, drifted, upwards, in, modern, times, for, example, while, ages, from, 10, to, 13, were, typically, acceptable, in, western, countries, during, the, mid, 19th, century, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, were, marked, by, changing, attitudes, resulting, in, raising, the, ages, of, consent, to, ages, generally, ranging, from, 16, to, 18, today, the, age, of, consent, varies, from, 12, years, or, onset, of, puberty, to, 21, but, 16, is, the, most, common, age, of, consent, though, some, jurisdictions, also, having, a, close, in, age, exception, allowing, two, adolescents, as, young, as, 12, years, of, age, to, have, sex, with, each, other, provided, their, ages, are, not, more, than, a, specified, number, of, years, apart, typical, no, more, than, a, 2, to, 3, years, age, difference, depending, on, the, jurisdiction, some, countries, outlaw, any, sex, outside, marriage, entirely, historically, and, still, in, many, countries, and, jurisdictions, today, a, female, s, sexual, experience, is, sometimes, considered, a, relevant, factor, in, the, prosecution, of, a, perpetrator, of, rape, also, historically, a, man, who, took, a, female, s, virginity, could, be, forced, to, marry, her, in, addition, children, born, as, a, result, of, premarital, sex, were, subject, to, various, legal, and, social, disabilities, such, as, being, considered, illegitimate, and, thus, barred, from, inheriting, from, the, putative, father, s, estate, from, bearing, the, father, s, surname, or, title, and, support, from, the, putative, father, many, of, these, legal, disabilities, on, children, born, from, extramarital, relationships, have, been, abolished, by, law, in, most, western, countries, though, social, ostracism, may, still, apply, all, major, religions, have, moral, codes, covering, issues, of, sexuality, morality, and, ethics, though, these, moral, codes, do, not, address, issues, of, sexuality, directly, they, seek, to, regulate, the, situations, which, can, give, rise, to, sexual, interest, and, to, influence, people, s, sexual, activities, and, practices, however, the, impact, of, religious, teaching, has, at, times, been, limited, for, example, though, most, religions, disapprove, of, premarital, sexual, relations, it, has, always, been, widely, practiced, nevertheless, these, religious, codes, have, always, had, a, strong, influence, on, peoples, attitudes, to, sexual, issues, virginity, was, often, considered, a, virtue, denoting, purity, and, physical, self, restraint, and, is, an, important, characteristic, in, greek, mythology, in, ancient, greek, literature, such, as, the, homeric, hymns, there, are, references, to, the, parthenon, goddesses, artemis, athena, and, hestia, proclaiming, pledges, to, eternal, virginity, greek, however, it, has, been, argued, a, maiden, s, state, of, parthenia, greek, as, invoked, by, these, deities, carries, a, slightly, different, meaning, from, what, is, normally, understood, as, virginity, in, modern, western, religions, rather, parthenia, focused, more, on, marriageability, and, abstract, concepts, without, strict, physical, requirements, which, would, be, adversely, affected, but, not, entirely, relinquished, by, pre, marital, sexual, intercourse, for, these, reasons, other, goddesses, not, eternally, committed, to, parthenia, within, the, homeric, hymns, are, able, to, renew, theirs, through, ritual, such, as, hera, or, choose, an, appearance, which, implies, the, possession, of, it, such, as, aphrodite, although, accounts, vary, the, goddess, of, witchcraft, known, as, hecate, has, been, portrayed, as, a, virgin, as, well, in, roman, times, the, vestal, virgins, were, the, highly, respected, strictly, celibate, although, not, necessarily, virginal, priestesses, of, vesta, and, keepers, of, the, sacred, fire, of, vesta, the, vestals, were, committed, to, the, priesthood, before, puberty, when, 6, 10, years, old, and, sworn, to, celibacy, for, a, period, of, 30, years, the, chastity, of, the, vestals, was, considered, to, have, a, direct, bearing, on, the, health, of, the, roman, state, allowing, the, sacred, fire, of, vesta, to, die, out, suggesting, that, the, goddess, had, withdrawn, her, protection, from, the, city, was, a, serious, offence, and, was, punishable, by, scourging, because, a, vestal, s, chastity, was, thought, to, be, directly, correlated, to, the, sacred, burning, of, the, fire, if, the, fire, were, extinguished, it, might, be, assumed, that, a, vestal, had, been, unchaste, the, penalty, for, a, vestal, virgin, found, to, have, had, sexual, relations, while, in, office, was, being, buried, alive, the, most, common, formulation, of, buddhist, ethics, for, lay, followers, are, the, five, precepts, and, the, eightfold, path, these, precepts, take, the, form, of, voluntary, personal, undertakings, not, divine, mandate, or, instruction, the, third, of, the, five, precepts, is, to, refrain, from, committing, sensual, misconduct, sensual, misconduct, is, defined, in, the, pali, canon, as, follows, abandoning, sensual, misconduct, abstains, from, sensual, misconduct, he, does, not, get, sexually, involved, with, those, who, are, protected, by, their, mothers, their, fathers, their, brothers, their, sisters, their, relatives, or, their, dhamma, those, with, husbands, those, who, entail, punishments, or, even, those, crowned, with, flowers, by, another, man, virginity, specifically, is, not, mentioned, in, the, canon, on, the, other, hand, buddhist, monks, and, nuns, of, most, traditions, are, expected, to, refrain, from, all, sexual, activity, and, the, buddha, is, said, to, have, admonished, his, followers, to, avoid, unchastity, as, if, it, were, a, pit, of, burning, cinders, the, 3rd, of, the, 5, precepts, in, buddhism, warns, against, any, sensual, misconduct, though, the, exact, definition, of, it, is, unclear, buddhists, have, been, more, open, compared, to, other, religions, about, the, subject, of, sex, and, that, has, expanded, over, time, as, with, christianity, although, a, traditionalist, would, assume, that, one, should, not, have, sex, before, marriage, many, buddhists, do, there, are, different, branches, of, buddhism, like, tantric, and, puritan, and, they, have, very, different, views, on, the, subject, of, sex, yet, managed, to, get, along, tantric, is, a, sanskrit, word, it, is, typically, translated, as, two, things, or, person, being, bound, together, in, the, time, of, gotama, the, man, who, came, to, be, known, as, buddha, sex, was, not, taboo, the, world, the, prince, lived, in, was, filled, with, earthly, pleasures, women, naked, from, the, waist, above, were, in, the, court, solely, to, serve, the, prince, gotama, s, father, even, constructed, a, chamber, of, love, prince, gotama, and, founded, the, beginnings, of, buddhism, which, included, the, denial, of, earthly, pleasures, in, order, to, follow, the, middle, way, the, stark, contrast, between, the, way, buddha, lived, his, life, before, and, after, rejecting, the, material, world, may, arguably, be, one, of, the, reasons, buddhism, evolved, the, way, it, did, in, the, present, the, mother, of, a, buddha, does, not, have, to, be, a, virgin, she, must, have, never, had, a, child, however, in, hinduism, premarital, virginity, on, the, part, of, the, bride, is, considered, ideal, the, prevailing, hindu, marriage, ceremony, or, the, vedic, wedding, centers, around, the, kanyadan, ritual, which, literally, means, gift, of, a, virgin, by, father, of, the, maiden, through, which, the, hindus, believe, they, gain, greatest, spiritual, merit, and, marriages, of, the, daughters, are, considered, a, spiritual, obligation, the, purity, of, women, is, especially, valued, in, south, asia, where, hinduism, is, most, commonly, practiced, sex, had, never, been, a, taboo, in, ancient, india, and, intactness, of, the, hymen, had, nothing, to, do, with, virginity, premarital, sex, is, forbidden, in, judaism, in, fact, the, precedent, for, the, mitzvot, which, are, related, in, deuteronomy, 22, 25, 29, which, regard, what, happens, when, a, man, rapes, a, virgin, may, well, have, been, set, at, shechem, after, the, rape, of, dinah, cf, genesis, 34, there, are, other, references, in, the, torah, to, virginity, in, the, first, reference, in, genesis, 19, 8, lot, offers, his, virgin, daughters, to, the, people, of, sodom, for, sexual, purposes, in, an, attempt, to, protect, his, guests, cf, genesis, 19, 4, 11, with, the, implication, that, the, people, of, sodom, would, be, more, likely, to, accept, the, offer, in, view, of, the, girls, virginity, than, they, would, otherwise, this, also, sets, the, precedent, for, israelites, to, avoid, homosexual, activity, cf, leviticus, 18, 22, 20, 13, the, next, reference, is, at, genesis, 24, 16, where, eliezer, is, seeking, a, wife, for, his, master, abraham, s, son, he, meets, rebecca, and, the, narrative, tells, us, the, damsel, was, very, fair, to, look, upon, a, virgin, neither, had, any, man, known, her, in, biblical, terms, to, know, is, a, euphemism, for, sexual, relations, children, born, to, a, single, woman, are, not, regarded, as, illegitimate, a, mamzer, or, subject, to, social, or, religious, disabilities, perez, and, zerach, for, example, and, although, their, mother, was, a, widow, who, was, willingly, impregnated, by, her, father, in, law, were, not, counted, as, mamzerim, cf, genesis, 38, 24, 30, halakhah, also, contains, rules, related, to, protecting, female, virgins, and, rules, regarding, pre, marital, sex, rape, and, the, effects, of, each, in, torah, a, damsel, who, has, not, the, sign, of, virginity, in, the, early, marriage, shall, be, punished, by, death, penalty, since, the, unvirgin, woman, among, israel, is, equal, with, a, defiled, whore, in, her, father, s, house, paul, the, apostle, expressed, the, view, that, a, person, s, body, belongs, to, god, and, is, god, s, temple, 1, corinthians, 6, 13, 3, 16, and, that, premarital, sex, is, immoral, 1, corinthians, 6, 18, on, an, equal, level, as, adultery, 1, corinthians, 6, 9, paul, also, expressed, the, view, in, 1, corinthians, 7, 1, 7, that, sexual, abstinence, is, the, preferred, state, for, both, men, and, women, however, he, stated, that, sexual, relations, are, expected, between, a, married, couple, according, to, classicist, evelyn, stagg, and, new, testament, scholar, frank, stagg, the, new, testament, holds, that, sex, is, reserved, for, marriage, harold, gentry, wrote, that, it, is, intended, by, god, for, the, husband, to, be, the, one, to, break, his, wife, s, hymen, which, when, perforated, during, the, consummation, of, marriage, creates, a, blood, covenant, that, seals, the, bond, of, holy, matrimony, between, husband, and, wife, stagg, maintains, that, the, new, testament, teaches, that, sex, outside, of, marriage, is, a, sin, of, adultery, if, either, of, the, participants, is, married, otherwise, the, sin, of, fornication, if, neither, of, the, participants, are, married, an, imperative, given, in, 1, corinthians, says, flee, from, sexual, immorality, all, other, sins, people, commit, are, outside, their, bodies, but, those, who, sin, sexually, sin, against, their, own, bodies, those, who, are, sexually, immoral, or, adulterers, are, listed, in, 1, corinthians, 6, 9, in, a, list, of, wrongdoers, who, will, not, inherit, the, kingdom, of, god, galatians, 5, 19, and, 1, corinthians, 7, 2, also, address, fornication, the, apostolic, decree, of, the, council, of, jerusalem, also, includes, a, prohibition, on, fornication, aquinas, went, further, emphasizing, that, acts, other, than, copulation, destroy, virginity, and, clarifying, that, involuntary, sexual, pleasure, does, not, destroy, virginity, from, his, summa, theologica, pleasure, resulting, from, resolution, of, semen, may, arise, in, two, ways, if, this, be, the, result, of, the, mind, s, purpose, it, destroys, virginity, whether, copulation, takes, place, or, not, augustine, however, mentions, copulation, because, such, like, resolution, is, the, ordinary, and, natural, result, thereof, on, another, way, this, may, happen, beside, the, purpose, of, the, mind, either, during, sleep, or, through, violence, and, without, the, mind, s, consent, although, the, flesh, derives, pleasure, from, it, or, again, through, weakness, of, nature, as, in, the, case, of, those, who, are, subject, to, a, flow, of, semen, on, such, cases, virginity, is, not, forfeit, because, such, like, pollution, is, not, the, result, of, impurity, which, excludes, virginity, some, have, theorized, that, the, new, testament, was, not, against, sex, before, marriage, the, discussion, turns, on, two, greek, words, moicheia, adultery, and, porneia, fornication, see, also, pornography, the, first, word, is, restricted, to, contexts, involving, sexual, betrayal, of, a, spouse, however, the, second, word, is, used, as, a, generic, term, for, illegitimate, sexual, activity, elsewhere, in, 1, corinthians, incest, homosexual, intercourse, according, to, some, interpretations, and, prostitution, are, all, explicitly, forbidden, by, name, however, the, septuagint, uses, porneia, to, refer, to, male, temple, prostitution, paul, is, preaching, about, activities, based, on, sexual, prohibitions, in, leviticus, in, the, context, of, achieving, holiness, the, theory, suggests, it, is, these, and, only, these, behaviors, that, are, intended, by, paul, s, prohibition, in, chapter, seven, the, strongest, argument, against, this, theory, is, that, the, modern, interpretation, of, the, new, testament, outside, corinthians, speaks, against, premarital, sex, christian, orthodoxy, accepts, that, mary, the, mother, of, jesus, was, a, virgin, at, the, time, jesus, was, conceived, based, on, the, accounts, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, and, the, gospel, of, luke, roman, catholics, eastern, orthodox, and, oriental, orthodox, as, well, as, many, lutherans, and, anglicans, hold, to, the, dogma, of, the, perpetual, virginity, of, mary, however, other, christians, reject, the, dogma, citing, sources, such, as, mark, 6, 3, isn, t, this, the, carpenter, the, son, of, mary, and, the, brother, of, james, joses, judas, and, simon, and, aren, t, his, sisters, here, with, us, the, catholic, church, holds, that, in, semitic, usage, the, terms, brother, sister, are, applied, not, only, to, children, of, the, same, parents, but, to, nephews, nieces, cousins, half, brothers, and, half, sisters, catholics, orthodox, christians, lutherans, and, other, groups, such, as, high, church, anglicans, may, refer, to, mary, as, the, virgin, mary, or, the, blessed, virgin, mary, the, catholic, encyclopedia, says, there, are, two, elements, in, virginity, the, material, element, that, is, to, say, the, absence, in, the, past, and, in, the, present, of, all, complete, and, voluntary, delectation, whether, from, lust, or, from, the, lawful, use, of, marriage, and, the, formal, element, that, is, the, firm, resolution, to, abstain, forever, from, sexual, pleasure, and, that, virginity, is, irreparably, lost, by, sexual, pleasure, voluntarily, and, completely, experienced, however, for, the, purposes, of, consecrated, virgins, it, is, canonically, enough, that, they, have, never, been, married, or, lived, in, open, violation, of, chastity, islam, considers, extramarital, sex, to, be, sinful, and, forbidden, islamic, law, prescribes, punishments, for, muslim, men, and, women, for, the, act, of, zin, though, in, western, cultures, premarital, sex, and, loss, of, virginity, may, be, considered, shameful, to, the, individual, in, some, muslim, societies, an, act, of, premarital, sex, even, if, not, falling, within, the, legal, standards, of, proof, may, result, in, personal, shame, and, loss, of, family, honor, in, some, modern, day, largely, muslim, societies, such, as, turkey, vaginal, examinations, for, verifying, a, woman, s, virginity, are, a, clinical, practice, which, are, at, times, state, enforced, these, types, of, examinations, are, typically, ordered, for, women, who, go, against, traditional, societal, notions, of, public, morality, and, rules, of, modesty, though, in, 1999, the, turkish, penal, code, was, altered, to, require, a, woman, s, consent, prior, to, performing, such, an, examination, in, sikhism, sexual, activity, is, supposed, to, occur, only, between, married, individuals, sikhism, advises, against, premarital, sex, as, it, has, a, high, potential, of, being, an, indulgence, of, lust, kaam, or, extreme, sexual, desire, sikhism, teaches, that, young, women, must, have, decent, modesty, sharam, because, the, honor, izzat, of, her, family, could, be, jeopardized, sexual, activity, and, even, living, together, prior, to, marriage, is, not, allowed, in, sikhism, virginity, is, an, important, aspect, of, spirituality, and, it, has, to, be, preserved, before, marriage, or, when, one, is, ready, to, move, into, another, sacred, state, of, being, with, their, significant, other
