angling, from, old, english, angol, meaning, hook, is, a, fishing, technique, that, uses, a, fish, hook, attached, to, a, fishing, line, to, tether, individual, fish, in, the, mouth, the, fishing, line, is, usually, manipulated, via, a, fishing, rod, although, rodless, techniques, such, as, handlining, also, exist, modern, angling, rods, are, usually, fitted, with, a, fishing, reel, that, functions, as, a, cranking, device, for, storing, retrieving, and, releasing, out, the, line, although, tenkara, fishing, and, traditional, cane, pole, fishing, are, two, rod, angling, methods, that, do, not, use, any, reel, the, fish, hook, itself, can, be, additionally, weighted, with, a, denser, tackle, called, a, sinker, and, is, typically, dressed, with, an, appetizing, bait, i, e, hookbait, to, attract, and, entice, the, fish, into, swallowing, the, hook, but, sometimes, an, inedible, fake, imitation, bait, with, multiple, attached, hooks, known, as, a, lure, is, used, instead, of, a, single, hook, with, edible, bait, some, type, of, bite, indicator, such, as, a, float, a, bell, or, a, quiver, tip, is, often, used, to, relay, underwater, status, of, the, hook, to, the, surface, and, alert, the, angler, of, a, fish, s, presence, when, angling, the, fisherman, known, as, the, angler, will, first, throw, the, hook, i, e, cast, to, a, chosen, area, of, water, i, e, fishing, ground, and, then, patiently, wait, for, fish, to, approach, and, devour, the, hookbait, it, is, also, not, uncommon, for, the, angler, to, scatter, some, loose, bait, groundbait, around, the, target, area, before, even, casting, the, hook, to, better, attract, distant, fish, with, scents, if, a, fish, has, succumbed, to, its, own, feeding, instinct, and, swallowed, the, baited, hook, i, e, bite, or, strike, the, hook, point, will, likely, pierce, into, and, anchor, itself, inside, the, fish, jaw, gullet, or, gill, and, the, fish, in, turn, becomes, firmly, tethered, by, the, fishing, line, once, the, fish, is, hooked, often, colloquially, called, fish, on, any, struggles, and, attempts, to, escape, will, pull, along, the, line, causing, the, bite, indicator, to, signal, the, angler, who, jerks, the, fishing, rod, back, to, further, deepen, the, hook, anchorage, i, e, setting, the, hook, and, then, tries, to, retrieve, the, line, back, pulling, the, fish, closer, in, the, process, during, the, line, retrieval, the, angler, will, carefully, monitor, the, line, and, rod, tension, to, avoid, equipment, breaking, with, stronger, and, feistier, fish, the, angler, might, need, to, temporarily, halt, or, even, reverse, the, line, retrieval, to, prolong, the, struggle, time, and, tire, out, the, fish, i, e, walking, the, fish, before, dragging, it, near, enough, to, eventually, lift, it, out, of, the, water, known, as, landing, for, a, successful, catch, sometimes, a, hand, net, or, landing, net, or, a, long, handled, hook, is, used, to, make, fetching, the, fish, easier, angling, is, the, principal, method, of, recreational, fishing, but, commercial, fisheries, also, use, angling, methods, such, as, longlining, trotlining, or, trolling, in, many, parts, of, the, world, a, fishing, licence, is, mandated, for, angling, and, size, limits, apply, to, certain, species, meaning, by, law, fish, below, and, or, above, a, certain, size, range, must, be, released, alive, after, capture, the, popular, fish, species, pursued, by, anglers, collectively, known, as, game, fish, vary, with, geography, among, the, many, species, of, saltwater, fish, that, are, angled, for, sport, globally, are, billfish, swordfish, sailfish, and, marlin, tuna, trevally, and, grouper, while, cod, and, sea, bass, are, popular, targets, in, europe, in, north, america, the, popular, freshwater, fish, species, include, bass, northern, pike, muskellunge, walleye, trout, and, anadromous, salmon, tilapia, channel, catfish, and, panfishes, such, as, crappie, sunfish, e, g, bluegill, and, yellow, perch, in, europe, asia, and, australasia, freshwater, anglers, often, pursue, species, such, as, carp, pike, bream, tench, rudd, roach, european, perch, catfish, and, barbel, many, of, which, are, regarded, as, undesirable, rough, fish, in, north, america, in, developed, countries, catch, and, release, angling, is, increasingly, practiced, by, sport, fishermen, in, recent, years, to, conserve, the, fish, stocks, and, help, maintain, sustainability, of, the, local, fisheries, angling, is, not, to, be, confused, with, snagging, another, fishing, technique, that, also, uses, line, and, hook, to, catch, fish, the, principal, differences, between, the, two, techniques, are, that, angling, often, uses, very, small, hooks, and, relies, on, the, target, fish, itself, to, voluntarily, swallow, the, hook, to, pierce, internally, into, the, fish, s, mouth, while, snagging, uses, very, large, sharp, multi, pointed, grappling, hooks, that, actively, claw, and, pierce, externally, into, the, body, gill, of, the, fish, and, hardly, ever, involves, any, hookbait, snagging, also, inflicts, far, more, mutilating, injuries, to, the, fish, and, makes, it, very, difficult, to, heal, and, survive, even, if, the, fish, is, released, alive, or, manages, to, escape, the, snag, the, use, of, the, hook, in, angling, is, descended, historically, from, what, would, today, be, called, a, gorge, the, word, gorge, in, this, context, comes, from, the, french, word, meaning, throat, gorges, were, used, by, ancient, peoples, to, capture, fish, and, animals, like, seal, walrus, and, birds, a, gorge, was, a, long, thin, piece, of, bone, or, stone, attached, by, its, midpoint, to, a, thin, line, the, gorge, would, be, baited, so, that, it, would, rest, parallel, to, the, lay, of, the, line, when, the, game, would, swallow, the, bait, a, tug, on, the, line, would, cause, the, gorge, to, orient, itself, at, right, angles, to, the, line, thereby, sticking, in, the, fish, or, animal, s, throat, or, gullet, gorges, evolved, into, the, modern, fishing, hook, which, is, j, shaped, with, a, loop, on, one, end, and, a, sharp, point, on, the, other, most, hooks, have, a, barb, near, the, point, to, better, anchor, the, point, and, prevent, a, fish, from, unhooking, itself, while, being, reeled, in, some, laws, and, regulations, require, hooks, to, be, barbless, typically, to, facilitate, catch, and, release, this, rule, is, commonly, implemented, to, protect, populations, of, certain, species, as, a, barbed, hook, could, cause, significant, collateral, lacerations, especially, when, it, penetrates, the, gill, that, can, kill, a, fish, even, after, released, alive, fishing, lines, are, long, ultra, thin, flexible, cords, that, may, come, in, monofilament, or, braided, multifilament, forms, traditional, fishing, lines, are, made, of, silk, while, most, modern, fishing, lines, are, made, from, synthetic, polymers, such, as, nylon, polyethylene, polyvinylidene, fluoride, fluorocarbon, or, copolymer, materials, important, specifications, for, a, fishing, line, include, its, material, and, forms, test, weight, diameter, stretch, memory, abrasion, resistance, uv, resistance, and, reflective, and, or, refractive, visibility, a, fishing, rod, is, a, long, thin, stick, pole, that, acts, as, an, extended, lever, and, allows, the, angler, to, amplify, line, movements, while, luring, and, pulling, the, fish, it, also, enhances, casting, distance, by, lengthening, the, swing, radius, compared, to, that, of, a, human, arm, and, increasing, the, launch, speed, of, the, terminal, tackles, the, hook, bait, lure, and, other, co, launched, attachments, such, as, float, and, sinker, feeder, traditional, fishing, rods, are, made, from, single, piece, of, hardwood, e, g, ash, and, hickory, or, bamboo, while, contemporary, rods, are, usually, made, from, alloys, e, g, aluminium, or, more, often, high, tensile, composite, materials, such, as, fibreglass, or, carbon, fiber, and, newer, rod, designs, are, often, constructed, from, hollow, blanks, to, increase, the, specific, strength, and, reduce, the, overall, weight, modern, rods, also, may, come, in, multi, piece, or, telescoping, forms, which, are, more, portable, and, storage, friendly, fishing, reels, are, manually, cranked, reels, typically, mounted, onto, a, fishing, rod, used, to, wind, and, stow, fishing, line, when, a, long, casting, distance, or, a, prolonged, retrieval, is, expected, traditional, fishing, reels, are, essentially, compact, windlasses, with, a, direct, drive, design, while, modern, reels, since, the, industrial, revolution, typically, are, multiplier, reels, that, use, internal, gear, trains, to, gain, a, higher, rotational, speed, most, reels, made, from, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, onwards, have, smoother, line, guides, anti, reverse, designs, gear, disengagement, mechanisms, and, sophisticated, drag, and, braking, adjustments, to, help, casting, farther, more, accurately, and, reliably, and, to, provide, optimal, pulling, forces, when, retrieving, the, line, a, bite, indicator, is, any, device, that, can, help, to, notify, the, angler, that, the, hook, has, been, swallowed, by, a, fish, there, are, many, types, of, bite, indicators, the, oldest, and, most, ubiquitously, used, being, the, fishing, float, a, lightweight, marker, buoy, that, floats, at, the, water, surface, with, the, hook, and, bait, suspended, below, it, when, the, fish, swallows, the, hook, the, leader, line, between, the, hook, and, the, float, pulls, the, float, deeper, into, the, water, causing, it, to, oscillates, in, and, out, of, water, in, a, bobbing, like, fashion, hence, its, american, english, name, the, bobber, other, bite, indicators, used, in, angling, include, in, angling, two, broad, types, of, baits, are, used, groundbait, which, is, thrown, separately, into, the, water, in, large, quantities, as, an, appetizer, to, olfactorily, attract, distant, fish, nearer, to, the, angler, s, position, and, hookbait, which, is, directly, attached, to, the, fish, hook, to, entice, the, fish, into, swallowing, the, hook, along, with, the, bait, in, colloquial, usage, the, word, bait, refers, specifically, to, hookbaits, which, can, be, further, separated, into, three, main, categories, natural, baits, artificial, baits, and, lures, the, choice, of, what, bait, to, use, is, dictated, mainly, by, the, target, species, s, diet, the, habitat, and, weather, conditions, which, can, alter, the, fish, s, foraging, behavior, the, angler, s, own, personal, preferences, and, the, local, fishery, regulations, using, an, optimal, angling, bait, can, increase, the, chance, of, catching, the, intended, fish, while, conversely, using, an, inadequate, bait, will, greatly, reduce, the, success, rate, especially, when, there, are, other, bait, fishermen, nearby, natural, baits, are, food, items, that, are, present, within, the, target, fish, s, natural, diet, which, are, usually, animals, at, a, lower, trophic, level, in, the, food, web, a, natural, bait, angler, with, few, exceptions, will, use, a, common, prey, species, of, the, target, fish, as, a, bait, the, natural, bait, used, may, be, live, food, known, as, a, live, bait, or, carcass, i, e, dead, bait, and, a, bait, improvised, from, grossly, intact, portions, of, a, dead, animal, e, g, fish, head, is, known, as, a, cutbait, common, natural, baits, for, both, fresh, and, saltwater, fishing, include, earthworm, leech, insects, and, larvae, minnow, squid, prawn, crayfish, and, even, crabs, frogs, and, salamanders, natural, baits, are, effective, due, to, the, real, texture, odour, and, movements, of, the, bait, presented, the, common, earthworm, is, a, universal, live, bait, for, freshwater, angling, and, grubs, and, maggots, are, also, excellent, bait, when, trout, fishing, grasshoppers, crickets, eels, and, even, ants, are, also, used, as, bait, for, trout, in, their, season, although, many, anglers, believe, that, trout, or, salmon, roe, is, superior, to, any, other, bait, crayfish, which, are, preyed, upon, by, a, variety, of, ray, finned, fishes, are, also, commonly, used, as, bait, either, live, or, with, only, the, tail, meat, they, are, popular, for, catching, catfish, largemouth, bass, smallmouth, bass, striped, bass, perch, and, pike, however, studies, had, confirmed, that, introducing, crayfish, outside, of, their, home, range, has, led, to, various, ecological, problems, of, them, becoming, invasive, species, transporting, crayfish, as, live, bait, has, also, contributed, to, the, spread, of, zebra, mussels, which, are, known, to, attach, themselves, onto, crayfish, in, various, waterways, throughout, europe, and, north, america, the, capture, transportation, and, culture, of, bait, fish, can, spread, damaging, organisms, between, ecosystems, endangering, them, in, 2007, several, american, states, enacted, regulations, designed, to, slow, the, spread, of, fish, diseases, including, viral, hemorrhagic, septicemia, by, bait, fish, because, of, the, risk, of, transmitting, myxobolus, cerebralis, whirling, disease, trout, and, salmon, should, not, be, used, as, bait, anglers, may, increase, the, possibility, of, contamination, by, emptying, bait, buckets, into, fishing, venues, and, collecting, or, using, bait, improperly, the, transportation, of, fish, from, one, location, to, another, can, break, the, law, and, cause, the, introduction, of, fish, alien, to, the, ecosystem, artificial, baits, are, edible, baits, that, are, not, directly, acquired, via, natural, means, but, are, made, from, other, food, materials, via, some, kind, of, artificial, processing, these, can, be, fish, food, that, are, either, homemade, e, g, dried, food, paste, or, commercially, purchased, e, g, boilies, and, feed, pellets, or, prepared, processed, food, such, as, cutlets, offals, dehulled, kernels, e, g, peas, and, corns, dairy, products, cheese, and, curd, bread, or, doughballs, made, from, various, ingredient, mixtures, e, g, rice, semolina, cornmeal, bread, crumbs, and, fishmeal, etc, which, can, be, used, to, attract, omnivorous, or, even, herbivorous, fish, in, lakes, in, southern, climates, such, as, florida, panfish, such, as, sunfish, will, even, take, household, wheat, bread, or, pet, food, as, bait, these, bread, bait, is, prepared, from, a, small, amount, of, bread, often, moistened, and, softened, by, saliva, then, squeezed, into, a, ball, of, the, bite, size, of, small, fish, some, baits, are, not, actual, food, items, but, rather, just, fake, replicas, of, food, made, of, inedible, materials, e, g, wood, metal, silicone, rubber, plastics, etc, and, are, designed, to, entice, predatory, fish, to, strike, by, imitating, the, appearance, and, motions, of, real, prey, shad, worm, frog, insect, crayfish, etc, these, inedible, replica, baits, are, typically, called, lures, instead, of, baits, although, expressions, such, as, swimbaits, crankbaits, jerkbaits, spinnerbaits, and, chatterbaits, are, still, used, when, describing, specific, types, of, lures, unlike, conventional, baits, lures, typically, do, not, release, any, scents, and, rely, solely, on, looks, and, sounds, vibrations, to, attract, fish, although, occasionally, chemical, attractants, e, g, dimethyl, propiothetin, are, still, used, in, addition, either, to, impregnate, favorable, smells, or, to, mask, away, unwanted, plastic, smells, many, anglers, prefer, to, fish, solely, using, lures, as, these, rely, more, on, the, user, s, rod, and, reel, actions, to, successfully, attract, fish, and, requires, frequent, casting, and, retrieving, the, line, and, are, thus, more, interactive, and, exciting, lures, can, be, broadly, categorized, into, hard, body, and, soft, body, lures, although, hybrid, lures, with, both, hard, and, soft, components, are, also, common, soft, body, lures, tend, to, give, a, more, flexible, and, realistic, swimming, posture, when, towed, through, the, water, while, hard, body, lures, usually, rely, on, stirring, up, more, noise, and, turbulences, some, newer, hard, lure, designs, however, are, multi, jointed, and, can, resemble, soft, lures, in, dynamics, soft, lures, are, typically, coupled, with, a, single, conventional, fish, hook, or, a, jighead, while, hard, lures, commonly, have, more, than, one, hooks, which, are, often, treble, hooks, when, lures, are, used, in, combination, with, other, terminal, tackles, floats, sinkers, swivels, etc, to, produce, sophisticated, presentations, the, entire, lure, package, is, known, as, a, rig, common, rigs, with, a, soft, plastic, lure, are, the, texas, rig, or, the, carolina, rig, some, fishing, lures, e, g, spoons, and, spinnerbaits, may, not, even, resemble, any, prey, in, looks, and, may, require, skilled, rod, movements, to, impart, an, enticing, presentation, to, the, target, fish, for, example, in, jigging, and, topwater, fishing, some, lures, such, as, the, flies, used, in, fly, fishing, are, ultralight, and, even, require, specialized, gears, and, techniques, to, be, cast, properly, in, modern, times, there, are, also, lures, that, photically, attract, fish, with, led, illuminiation, as, well, as, battery, powered, bionic, lures, that, are, essentially, primitive, robot, fish, that, can, swim, around, without, needing, to, be, towed, by, a, fishing, line, almost, all, recreational, angling, activities, involve, the, use, of, fishing, rods, which, is, used, to, manipulate, the, movements, of, fishing, lines, and, to, allow, farther, casting, of, baits, lures, the, main, rod, fishing, techniques, are, float, fishing, bottom, fishing, lure, fishing, and, trolling, while, the, former, two, are, often, collectively, known, as, bait, fishing, due, to, the, exclusive, use, of, conventional, edible, baits, float, fishing, is, the, most, common, method, of, angling, defined, by, the, use, of, a, compact, light, buoy, attached, to, fishing, line, known, as, a, float, or, bobber, in, the, united, states, as, the, bite, indicator, due, to, buoyancy, the, float, remains, at, the, water, surface, and, suspends, the, baited, hook, at, a, predetermined, depth, it, can, also, drift, in, the, prevailing, current, and, carry, the, hook, to, areas, of, water, otherwise, inaccessible, by, casting, alone, when, the, fish, bites, and, swallows, the, hook, the, float, visually, signals, any, forces, exerted, on, the, leader, line, below, it, as, the, fisherman, can, then, see, it, being, pulled, underwater, and, or, sideways, bottom, fishing, also, called, legering, in, the, united, kingdom, uses, a, weighted, tackle, called, a, sinker, tied, to, the, end, of, the, fishing, line, to, keep, the, baited, hook, close, to, the, bottom, of, the, water, to, target, groundfishes, such, as, sucker, bream, catfish, and, crappie, the, sinker, can, also, be, used, to, add, momentum, to, the, hook, and, help, casting, the, line, to, a, further, distance, the, method, can, be, used, both, with, handlining, and, rod, fishing, and, can, be, done, both, from, boats, and, from, the, land, specialized, fishing, rods, called, donkas, are, also, commonly, used, for, bottom, fishing, and, a, quiver, tip, sometimes, coupled, with, a, jingle, bell, is, used, instead, as, the, bite, indicator, some, sinkers, are, replaced, by, feeders, which, is, designed, to, contain, and, release, groundbaits, to, help, attract, fish, towards, the, hook, lure, fishing, uses, a, type, of, artificial, fake, bait, known, as, lure, which, is, usually, made, from, inedible, materials, such, as, wood, metal, and, plastics, unlike, conventional, fishing, baits, lures, do, not, emit, any, scent, and, thus, cannot, attract, fish, olfactorily, but, instead, using, prey, like, appearances, movements, vibrations, bright, reflections, and, flashy, colors, to, attract, and, entice, carnivorous, predatory, fish, into, mistakenly, striking, many, lures, are, equipped, with, more, than, one, hooks, to, better, the, chance, of, anchoring, into, the, fish, s, mouth, though, some, hookless, lures, are, used, to, bait, the, fish, nearer, so, it, can, be, captured, via, other, means, such, as, spearing, netting, trapping, or, capturing, by, hand, in, addition, to, rod, angling, handlining, longlining, and, commercial, trolling, also, employ, lure, fishing, lure, fishing, is, a, popular, style, of, recreational, fishing, when, fishing, a, lure, angler, will, repeatedly, cast, out, the, lure, afar, and, then, methodically, retrieves, the, line, pulling, the, lure, through, the, water, and, creating, vibrations, turbulent, splashes, and, or, a, popping, action, in, the, process, which, imitating, a, small, aquatic, prey, such, as, a, baitfish, a, drowning, insect, or, a, frog, a, skilled, angler, can, explore, many, possible, hiding, spots, for, fish, through, lure, casting, such, as, under, logs, and, on, flats, no, bite, indicator, is, used, and, when, the, lure, catches, the, attention, of, a, game, fish, and, successfully, results, in, biting, swallowing, of, the, lure, the, angler, can, detect, it, by, watching, for, splashes, and, feeling, any, vibrations, rod, bending, and, changes, in, line, tension, lure, fishing, also, typically, uses, relatively, lightweight, fishing, rods, coupled, with, baitcasting, reels, or, spinning, reels, depending, on, the, style, of, lure, retrieval, lure, fishing, can, roughly, be, separated, into, power, fishing, which, relies, on, more, frequent, and, vigorous, lure, retrievals, to, increase, the, chance, of, luring, fish, and, finesse, fishing, which, focuses, on, the, more, lingered, and, vivid, lure, presentation, within, each, cast, retrieval, cycle, to, better, entice, fish, rod, trolling, is, basically, a, simplified, version, of, commercial, trolling, see, below, with, fishing, rods, functioning, as, improvised, outriggers, to, tow, the, baits, lures, through, the, water, usually, behind, or, beside, a, moving, boat, with, the, rod, fixated, to, the, gunwale, it, can, also, be, done, by, very, slowly, winding, the, line, in, like, finesse, type, lure, fishing, or, even, sweeping, the, line, sideways, with, the, angler, operating, the, rod, from, a, static, position, e, g, atop, a, jetty, pier, or, bridge, a, variation, of, trolling, is, drift, fishing, which, is, usually, done, from, an, unpowered, boat, in, faster, flowing, waters, the, line, is, not, actively, reeled, and, the, bait, lure, is, allowed, to, drift, and, react, freely, to, the, turbulences, in, the, water, current, much, like, how, a, tethered, kite, would, behave, in, a, wind, gust, although, all, angling, techniques, use, hook, and, line, the, term, line, fishing, specifically, refers, to, those, that, do, not, involve, using, fishing, rods, handlining, is, angling, with, a, handheld, fishing, line, baited, with, lures, or, bait, fish, just, like, normal, rod, angling, handlining, is, the, oldest, angling, technique, used, by, mankind, and, can, be, done, from, boats, or, from, the, shore, it, is, used, mainly, to, catch, groundfish, and, squid, but, smaller, pelagic, fish, can, also, be, caught, deadlining, is, the, practice, of, leaving, a, baited, handline, in, the, water, with, the, other, end, fastened, to, the, bank, and, returning, later, usually, overnight, to, check, and, capture, any, tethered, fish, similar, to, the, use, of, a, snare, trap, by, hunters, longlining, is, a, commercial, fishing, technique, that, uses, a, long, heavy, line, with, a, series, of, hundreds, or, even, thousands, of, baited, hooks, hanging, from, the, main, line, via, branch, lines, called, snoods, longlines, are, usually, operated, from, specialised, boats, called, longliners, which, use, a, special, winch, to, haul, in, the, line, and, can, operate, in, deeper, waters, targeting, pelagic, species, such, as, swordfish, tuna, halibut, and, sablefish, droplining, involves, setting, a, longline, vertically, down, into, the, water, instead, of, being, more, horizontally, deployed, like, longlining, with, a, series, of, baited, hooks, droplines, are, weighted, at, the, bottom, and, have, a, float, at, the, top, they, are, not, usually, as, long, as, longlines, and, have, fewer, hooks, and, tend, to, be, stationary, trotlining, uses, a, longline, that, instead, of, being, tethered, to, the, water, surface, only, at, one, end, are, fixed, at, near, the, surface, at, both, ends, of, the, longline, with, hooked, snood, lines, hanging, vertically, down, along, the, main, line, trotlines, are, used, for, catching, crabs, or, fish, e, g, catfish, particularly, across, rivers, they, can, be, physically, set, in, many, ways, such, as, tying, each, end, to, a, fixed, structure, and, span, the, line, across, the, water, in, between, like, a, boom, and, adjusting, rest, of, the, line, with, weights, and, floats, slabbing, is, a, bass, fishing, technique, that, resembles, jigging, and, involves, repetitively, lifting, and, dropping, a, flat, lure, usually, made, of, 1, to, 2, 5, oz, of, lead, painted, to, look, like, a, baitfish, or, heavy, slabs, of, metal, through, a, school, of, actively, feeding, fish, that, the, angler, has, located, on, a, fishfinder, it, is, used, on, white, and, striped, bass, in, the, reservoirs, of, the, southern, us, rodless, trolling, is, typically, used, in, commercial, fishing, with, one, or, more, baited, lines, drawn, through, the, water, behind, a, slow, moving, fishing, boat, that, is, usually, equipped, with, outriggers, downriggers, and, trolling, motors, trolling, is, used, to, catch, economic, pelagic, fish, such, as, mackerel, and, kingfish, pahila, literally, meaning, pulled, is, a, filipino, traditional, shoreline, trolling, uniquely, using, baited, hooks, tied, to, a, laterally, flattened, float, called, palyaw, which, is, shaped, like, a, small, outrigger, boat, a, catamaran, or, a, fish, a, longline, is, attached, to, the, float, and, set, unto, the, water, s, edge, and, dragged, by, someone, running, or, walking, along, the, beach, the, combination, of, the, water, resistance, and, the, diagonal, pull, forces, the, float, outwards, into, deeper, waters, like, a, kite, once, the, line, reaches, its, maximum, line, length, it, moves, rapidly, parallel, to, the, person, pulling, it, along, the, beach, and, is, pulled, back, to, the, shore, intermittently, to, check, for, catches, it, is, also, called, subid, subid, sibid, sibid, paguyod, pahinas, hilada, or, saliwsiw, among, other, names, in, other, philippine, languages, laws, and, regulations, managing, angling, vary, greatly, often, regionally, within, countries, these, commonly, include, permits, licences, closed, periods, seasons, where, specific, species, are, unavailable, for, harvest, restrictions, on, gear, types, and, quotas, laws, generally, prohibit, catching, fish, with, hooks, other, than, in, the, mouth, i, e, snagging, or, foul, hooking, and, jagging, or, the, use, of, nets, and, hand, hooks, other, than, as, an, aid, in, landing, a, captured, fish, some, species, such, as, bait, fish, may, be, taken, with, nets, and, a, few, for, food, sometimes, non, sport, fish, are, considered, of, lesser, value, and, it, may, be, permissible, to, take, them, by, methods, like, snagging, bow, and, arrow, or, spearing, none, of, which, fall, under, the, definition, of, angling, since, they, do, not, rely, upon, the, use, of, a, hook, and, line, fishing, seasons, are, set, by, countries, or, localities, to, indicate, what, kinds, of, fish, may, be, caught, during, sport, fishing, also, known, as, angling, for, a, certain, period, of, time, fishing, seasons, are, enforced, usually, by, water, police, to, maintain, ecological, balance, and, to, protect, species, of, fish, during, their, spawning, period, during, which, they, are, easier, to, catch, and, more, physiologically, vulnerable, slot, limits, prohibit, the, harvest, of, fish, where, the, measured, lengths, from, the, snout, to, the, end, of, the, tail, fin, fall, within, a, protected, interval, these, are, put, in, action, to, help, protect, certain, fish, usually, juvenile, in, a, given, area, they, generally, require, anglers, to, release, captured, fish, if, they, fall, within, a, given, size, range, allowing, anglers, to, keep, only, smaller, though, rare, or, larger, fish, slot, limits, vary, from, water, to, water, depending, on, what, local, officials, believe, would, produce, the, best, outcome, for, managing, fish, populations, individual, fishing, quota, ifq, also, known, as, individual, transferable, quota, itq, is, a, kind, of, catch, share, that, sets, a, species, specific, total, allowable, catch, tac, typically, by, weight, and, for, a, given, time, period, a, dedicated, portion, of, the, tac, called, quota, share, is, then, allocated, to, individual, fishermen, and, can, typically, be, transferable, i, e, bought, sold, or, leased, as, of, 2008, 148, major, fisheries, generally, a, single, species, in, a, single, fishing, ground, around, the, world, had, adopted, some, variant, of, this, approach, along, with, approximately, 100, smaller, fisheries, in, individual, countries, approximately, 10, of, the, marine, harvest, was, managed, by, itqs, as, of, 2008, 218, the, first, countries, to, adopt, individual, fishing, quotas, were, the, netherlands, iceland, and, canada, in, the, late, 1970s, and, the, most, recent, is, the, united, states, scallop, general, category, ifq, program, in, 2010, the, first, country, to, adopt, individual, transferable, quotas, as, a, national, policy, was, new, zealand, in, 1986, the, minimum, landing, size, mls, is, the, smallest, fish, measurement, at, which, it, is, legal, for, the, fisherman, to, keep, a, captured, fish, the, mls, depends, on, the, species, of, fish, and, allowed, sizes, also, vary, around, the, world, as, they, are, legal, definitions, which, are, defined, by, the, local, regulatory, authority, the, idea, behind, this, limitation, is, that, only, the, older, more, mature, adult, fish, get, taken, leaving, growing, juveniles, behind, to, continue, breeding, and, propagating, their, species, there, is, some, criticism, of, this, legal, requirement, however, as, it, applies, artificial, selection, pressure, to, the, fish, population, see, fisheries, induced, evolution, unless, the, anglers, voluntarily, practise, catch, and, release, indiscriminate, of, sizes, as, larger, fish, whose, survival, has, been, more, successful, so, far, get, taken, out, of, the, population, the, genes, for, larger, size, are, reduced, or, removed, from, the, gene, pool, while, fish, that, mature, at, a, smaller, size, survive, longer, to, continue, breeding, and, the, average, size, of, fish, stock, shrinks, over, time, this, has, led, to, a, collapse, in, the, amount, of, catchable, fish, in, some, fisheries, although, most, anglers, keep, their, catch, for, consumption, catch, and, release, fishing, is, increasingly, practiced, especially, by, fly, anglers, the, general, principle, is, that, releasing, fish, allows, them, to, survive, thus, avoiding, unintended, depletion, of, the, population, for, species, such, as, marlin, muskellunge, and, bass, there, is, a, cultural, taboo, among, anglers, against, taking, them, for, food, in, many, parts, of, the, world, size, limits, apply, to, certain, species, meaning, fish, below, a, certain, size, must, by, law, be, released, it, is, generally, believed, that, larger, fish, have, a, greater, breeding, potential, some, fisheries, have, a, slot, limit, that, allows, the, taking, of, smaller, and, larger, fish, but, requiring, that, intermediate, sized, fish, be, released, it, is, generally, accepted, that, this, management, approach, will, help, the, fishery, create, a, number, of, large, trophy, sized, fish, in, smaller, fisheries, that, are, heavily, fished, catch, and, release, is, the, only, way, to, ensure, that, catchable, fish, will, be, available, from, year, to, year, the, practice, of, catch, and, release, is, criticised, by, some, who, consider, it, unethical, to, inflict, pain, upon, a, fish, for, purposes, of, sport, some, of, those, who, object, to, releasing, fish, do, not, object, to, killing, fish, for, food, adherents, of, catch, and, release, dispute, this, charge, pointing, out, that, fish, commonly, feed, on, hard, and, spiky, prey, items, and, as, such, can, be, expected, to, have, tough, mouths, and, also, that, some, fish, will, re, take, a, lure, they, have, just, been, hooked, on, a, behaviour, that, is, unlikely, if, hooking, were, painful, opponents, of, catch, and, release, fishing, would, find, it, preferable, to, ban, or, to, severely, restrict, angling, on, the, other, hand, proponents, state, that, catch, and, release, is, necessary, for, many, fisheries, to, remain, sustainable, is, a, practice, that, generally, has, high, survival, rates, and, consider, the, banning, of, angling, as, not, reasonable, or, necessary, in, some, jurisdictions, in, the, canadian, province, of, manitoba, for, example, catch, and, release, is, mandatory, for, some, species, such, as, brook, trout, many, of, the, jurisdictions, which, mandate, the, live, release, of, sport, fish, also, require, the, use, of, artificial, lures, and, barbless, hooks, to, minimise, the, chance, of, injury, to, fish, mandatory, catch, and, release, also, exists, in, the, republic, of, ireland, where, it, was, introduced, as, a, conservation, measure, to, prevent, the, decline, of, atlantic, salmon, stocks, on, some, rivers, in, switzerland, catch, and, release, fishing, is, considered, inhumane, and, was, banned, in, september, 2008, barbless, hooks, which, can, be, created, from, a, standard, hook, by, removing, the, barb, with, pliers, or, can, be, bought, are, sometimes, resisted, by, anglers, because, they, believe, that, increased, fish, escapes, barbless, hooks, reduce, handling, time, thereby, increasing, survival, concentrating, on, keeping, the, line, taut, while, fighting, fish, using, recurved, point, or, triple, grip, style, hooks, on, lures, and, equipping, lures, that, do, not, have, them, with, split, rings, can, significantly, reduce, escapement, angling, is, also, practiced, in, fishing, tournaments, where, contestants, compete, for, prizes, based, on, the, total, length, or, weight, of, a, fish, usually, of, a, pre, determined, species, caught, within, a, specified, time, these, contests, originated, as, local, fishing, contests, and, have, evolved, to, include, large, competitive, circuits, with, professional, anglers, that, are, supported, by, commercial, endorsements, professional, anglers, may, gain, cash, prizes, for, placing, well, in, tournaments, similar, competitive, fishing, exists, at, the, amateur, level, with, fishing, derbies, in, general, derbies, can, be, distinguished, from, tournaments, derbies, normally, require, fish, to, be, killed, as, opposed, to, tournaments, where, points, are, normally, deducted, if, fish, can, not, be, released, alive, a, ten, year, long, survey, of, us, fishing, club, members, completed, in, 1997, indicated, that, motivations, for, recreational, angling, have, shifted, from, personal, leisure, outdoor, exercise, experiencing, nature, and, thrill, of, the, catch, to, the, importance, of, family, time, and, social, bonding, via, recreational, fishing, anglers, with, higher, family, incomes, went, fishing, more, frequently, and, were, less, concerned, about, obtaining, fish, as, food, a, german, study, indicated, that, satisfaction, derived, from, angling, was, not, dependent, on, the, actual, catch, but, depended, more, on, the, angler, s, expectations, of, the, experience, a, 2006, study, by, the, louisiana, department, of, wildlife, and, fisheries, tracked, the, motivations, of, anglers, on, the, red, river, among, the, most, often, stated, responses, were, the, fun, of, catching, fish, the, experience, to, catch, a, lot, of, fish, or, a, very, large, fish, for, challenge, and, adventure, use, as, food, was, not, investigated, as, a, motive
