rowing, often, called, crew, in, the, united, states, is, the, sport, of, racing, boats, using, oars, it, differs, from, paddling, sports, in, that, rowing, oars, are, attached, to, the, boat, using, rowlocks, while, paddles, are, not, connected, to, the, boat, rowing, is, divided, into, two, disciplines, sculling, and, sweep, rowing, in, sculling, each, rower, holds, two, oars, one, in, each, hand, while, in, sweep, rowing, each, rower, holds, one, oar, with, both, hands, there, are, several, boat, classes, in, which, athletes, may, compete, ranging, from, single, sculls, occupied, by, one, person, to, shells, with, eight, rowers, and, a, coxswain, called, eights, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, course, types, and, formats, of, racing, but, most, elite, and, championship, level, racing, is, conducted, on, calm, water, courses, 2, kilometres, 1, 2, mi, long, with, several, lanes, marked, using, buoys, modern, rowing, as, a, competitive, sport, can, be, traced, to, the, early, 17th, century, when, professional, watermen, held, races, regattas, on, the, river, thames, in, london, england, often, prizes, were, offered, by, the, london, guilds, and, livery, companies, amateur, competition, began, towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, with, the, arrival, of, boat, clubs, at, british, public, schools, similarly, clubs, were, formed, at, colleges, within, oxford, and, cambridge, on, the, programme, for, the, 1896, games, racing, did, not, take, place, due, to, bad, weather, male, rowers, have, competed, since, the, 1900, summer, olympics, women, s, rowing, was, added, to, the, olympic, programme, in, 1976, today, there, are, fourteen, boat, classes, which, race, at, the, olympics, in, addition, the, sport, s, governing, body, the, world, rowing, federation, holds, the, annual, world, rowing, championships, with, twenty, two, boat, classes, across, six, continents, 150, countries, now, have, rowing, federations, that, participate, in, the, sport, major, domestic, competitions, take, place, in, dominant, rowing, nations, and, include, the, boat, race, and, henley, royal, regatta, in, the, united, kingdom, the, australian, rowing, championships, in, australia, the, harvard, yale, regatta, and, head, of, the, charles, regatta, in, the, united, states, and, the, royal, canadian, henley, regatta, in, canada, many, other, competitions, often, exist, for, racing, between, clubs, schools, and, universities, in, each, nation, an, egyptian, funerary, inscription, of, 1430, bc, records, that, the, warrior, amenhotep, amenophis, ii, was, also, renowned, for, his, feats, of, oarsmanship, though, there, is, some, disagreement, among, scholars, over, whether, there, were, rowing, contests, in, ancient, egypt, in, the, aeneid, virgil, mentions, rowing, forming, part, of, the, funeral, games, arranged, by, aeneas, in, honour, of, his, father, in, the, 13th, century, venetian, festivals, called, regata, included, boat, races, among, others, the, first, known, modern, rowing, races, began, from, competition, among, the, professional, watermen, in, the, united, kingdom, that, provided, ferry, and, taxi, service, on, the, river, thames, in, london, prizes, for, wager, races, were, often, offered, by, the, london, guilds, and, livery, companies, or, wealthy, owners, of, riverside, houses, the, oldest, surviving, such, race, doggett, s, coat, and, badge, was, first, contested, in, 1715, and, is, still, held, annually, from, london, bridge, to, chelsea, during, the, 19th, century, these, races, were, to, become, numerous, and, popular, attracting, large, crowds, prize, matches, amongst, professionals, similarly, became, popular, on, other, rivers, throughout, great, britain, in, the, 19th, century, notably, on, the, tyne, in, america, the, earliest, known, race, dates, back, to, 1756, in, new, york, when, a, pettiauger, defeated, a, cape, cod, whaleboat, in, a, race, amateur, competition, in, england, began, towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, age, before, technology, documentary, evidence, from, this, period, is, sparse, but, it, is, known, that, the, monarch, boat, club, of, eton, college, and, the, isis, club, of, westminster, school, were, both, in, existence, in, the, 1790s, the, star, club, and, arrow, club, in, london, for, gentlemen, amateurs, were, also, in, existence, before, 1800, at, the, university, of, oxford, bumping, races, were, first, organised, in, 1815, when, brasenose, college, and, jesus, college, boat, clubs, had, the, first, annual, race, while, at, cambridge, the, first, recorded, races, were, in, 1827, brasenose, beat, jesus, to, win, oxford, university, s, first, head, of, the, river, the, two, clubs, claim, to, be, the, oldest, established, boat, clubs, in, the, world, the, boat, race, between, oxford, university, and, cambridge, university, first, took, place, in, 1829, and, was, the, second, intercollegiate, sporting, event, following, the, first, varsity, cricket, match, by, 2, years, the, interest, in, the, first, boat, race, and, subsequent, matches, led, the, town, of, henley, on, thames, to, begin, hosting, an, annual, regatta, in, 1839, founded, in, 1818, leander, club, is, the, world, s, oldest, public, rowing, club, the, second, oldest, club, which, still, exists, is, the, der, hamburger, und, germania, ruder, club, which, was, founded, 1836, and, marked, the, beginning, of, rowing, as, an, organized, sport, in, germany, during, the, 19th, century, as, in, england, wager, matches, in, north, america, between, professionals, became, very, popular, attracting, vast, crowds, narragansett, boat, club, was, founded, in, 1838, exclusively, for, rowing, during, an, 1837, parade, in, providence, r, i, a, group, of, boatmen, were, pulling, a, longboat, on, wheels, which, carried, the, oldest, living, survivor, of, the, 1772, gaspee, raid, they, boasted, to, the, crowd, that, they, were, the, fastest, rowing, crew, on, the, bay, a, group, of, providence, locals, took, issue, with, this, and, challenged, them, to, race, which, the, providence, group, summarily, won, the, six, man, core, of, that, group, went, on, in, 1838, to, found, nbc, detroit, boat, club, was, founded, in, 1839, and, is, the, second, oldest, continuously, operated, rowing, club, in, the, u, s, in, 1843, the, first, american, college, rowing, club, was, formed, at, yale, university, the, harvard, yale, regatta, is, the, oldest, intercollegiate, sporting, event, in, the, united, states, having, been, contested, every, year, since, 1852, excepting, interruptions, for, wars, and, the, covid, 19, pandemic, the, schuylkill, navy, is, an, association, of, amateur, rowing, clubs, of, philadelphia, founded, in, 1858, it, is, the, oldest, amateur, athletic, governing, body, in, the, united, states, the, member, clubs, are, all, on, the, schuylkill, river, where, it, flows, through, fairmount, park, in, philadelphia, mostly, on, the, historic, boathouse, row, the, success, of, the, schuylkill, navy, and, similar, organizations, contributed, heavily, to, the, extinction, of, professional, rowing, and, the, sport, s, current, status, as, an, amateur, sport, at, its, founding, it, had, nine, clubs, today, there, are, 12, at, least, 23, other, clubs, have, belonged, to, the, navy, at, various, times, many, of, the, clubs, have, a, rich, history, and, have, produced, a, large, number, of, olympians, and, world, class, competitors, the, sport, s, governing, body, f, d, ration, internationale, des, soci, t, s, d, aviron, was, founded, in, 1892, and, is, the, oldest, international, sports, federation, in, the, olympic, movement, fisa, first, organized, a, european, rowing, championships, in, 1893, an, annual, world, rowing, championships, was, introduced, in, 1962, rowing, has, also, been, conducted, at, the, olympic, games, since, 1900, cancelled, at, the, first, modern, games, in, 1896, due, to, bad, weather, women, row, in, all, boat, classes, from, single, scull, to, coxed, eights, across, the, same, age, ranges, and, standards, as, men, from, junior, amateur, through, university, level, to, elite, athlete, typically, men, and, women, compete, in, separate, crews, although, mixed, crews, and, mixed, team, events, also, take, place, coaching, for, women, is, similar, to, that, for, men, the, world, s, first, women, s, rowing, team, was, formed, in, 1896, at, the, furnivall, sculling, club, in, london, the, club, with, signature, colors, a, very, distinct, myrtle, and, gold, began, as, a, women, s, club, but, eventually, allowed, the, admittance, of, men, in, 1901, the, first, international, women, s, races, were, the, 1954, european, rowing, championships, the, introduction, of, women, s, rowing, at, the, 1976, summer, olympics, in, montreal, increased, the, growth, of, women, s, rowing, because, it, created, the, incentive, for, national, rowing, federations, to, support, women, s, events, rowing, at, the, 2012, summer, olympics, in, london, included, six, events, for, women, compared, with, eight, for, men, in, the, us, rowing, is, an, ncaa, sport, for, women, but, not, for, men, though, it, is, one, of, the, country, s, oldest, collegiate, sports, the, difference, is, in, large, part, due, to, the, requirements, of, title, ix, at, the, international, level, women, s, rowing, traditionally, has, been, dominated, by, eastern, european, countries, such, as, romania, russia, and, bulgaria, although, other, countries, such, as, germany, canada, the, netherlands, great, britain, and, new, zealand, often, field, competitive, teams, the, united, states, also, has, had, very, competitive, crews, and, in, recent, years, these, crews, have, become, even, more, competitive, given, the, surge, in, women, s, collegiate, rowing, now, there, is, usually, the, same, number, of, girls, and, boys, in, a, group, while, rowing, the, athlete, sits, in, the, boat, facing, toward, the, stern, and, uses, the, oars, also, interchangeably, referred, to, as, blades, which, are, held, in, place, by, oarlocks, also, referred, to, as, gates, to, propel, the, boat, forward, towards, the, bow, rowing, is, distinguished, from, paddling, in, that, the, oar, is, attached, to, the, boat, using, an, oarlock, where, in, paddling, there, is, no, oarlock, or, attachment, of, the, paddle, to, the, boat, the, rowing, stroke, may, be, characterized, by, two, fundamental, reference, points, the, catch, which, is, placement, of, the, oar, spoon, in, the, water, and, the, extraction, also, known, as, the, finish, or, release, when, the, rower, removes, the, oar, spoon, from, the, water, after, the, oar, is, placed, in, the, water, at, the, catch, the, rower, applies, pressure, to, the, oar, levering, the, boat, forward, which, is, called, the, drive, phase, of, the, stroke, once, the, rower, extracts, the, oar, from, the, water, the, recovery, phase, begins, setting, up, the, rower, s, body, for, the, next, stroke, at, the, catch, the, rower, places, the, oar, in, the, water, and, applies, pressure, to, the, oar, by, pushing, the, seat, toward, the, bow, of, the, boat, by, extending, the, legs, thus, pushing, the, boat, through, the, water, the, point, of, placement, of, the, spoon, in, the, water, is, a, relatively, fixed, point, about, which, the, oar, serves, as, a, lever, to, propel, the, boat, as, the, rower, s, legs, approach, full, extension, the, rower, pivots, the, torso, toward, the, bow, of, the, boat, and, then, finally, pulls, the, arms, towards, his, or, her, chest, the, hands, meet, the, chest, right, above, the, diaphragm, at, the, end, of, the, stroke, with, the, oar, spoon, still, in, the, water, the, hands, drop, slightly, to, unload, the, oar, so, that, spring, energy, stored, in, the, bend, of, the, oar, gets, transferred, to, the, boat, which, eases, removing, the, oar, from, the, water, and, minimizes, energy, wasted, on, lifting, water, above, the, surface, splashing, the, recovery, phase, follows, the, drive, the, recovery, starts, with, the, extraction, and, involves, coordinating, the, body, movements, with, the, goal, to, move, the, oar, back, to, the, catch, position, in, extraction, the, rower, pushes, down, on, the, oar, handle, to, quickly, lift, the, spoon, out, of, the, water, and, rapidly, rotates, the, oar, so, that, the, spoon, is, parallel, to, the, water, this, process, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, feathering, the, blade, simultaneously, the, rower, pushes, the, oar, handle, away, from, the, chest, the, spoon, should, emerge, from, the, water, perpendicular, or, square, and, be, feathered, immediately, once, clear, of, the, water, after, feathering, and, extending, the, arms, the, rower, pivots, the, body, forward, once, the, hands, are, past, the, knees, the, rower, compresses, the, legs, which, moves, the, seat, towards, the, stern, of, the, boat, the, leg, compression, occurs, relatively, slowly, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, stroke, which, affords, the, rower, a, moment, to, recover, and, allows, the, boat, to, glide, through, the, water, the, gliding, of, the, boat, through, the, water, during, recovery, is, often, called, run, a, controlled, slide, is, necessary, to, maintain, momentum, and, achieve, optimal, boat, run, however, various, teaching, methods, disagree, about, the, optimal, relation, in, timing, between, drive, and, recovery, near, the, end, of, the, recovery, the, rower, squares, the, oar, spoon, into, perpendicular, orientation, with, respect, to, the, water, and, begins, another, stroke, rowing, technique, drills, are, essential, components, of, a, rower, s, training, routine, focusing, on, specific, aspects, of, the, rowing, stroke, to, refine, skills, and, enhance, overall, performance, these, structured, exercises, whether, performed, individually, on, the, erg, in, groups, or, whole, boat, provide, a, targeted, approach, to, improving, coordination, body, positioning, and, teamwork, the, forward, pick, drill, often, used, as, a, standard, warm, up, for, rowing, crews, in, groups, of, 4, or, 6, focuses, on, isolating, different, components, of, the, recovery, and, drive, sequence, starting, with, arms, only, strokes, and, gradually, incorporating, the, back, slide, and, full, slide, rowers, gain, a, nuanced, understanding, of, the, interplay, between, these, elements, the, drill, aims, to, enhance, body, preparation, providing, rowers, with, a, tactile, sense, of, how, each, phase, should, seamlessly, flow, into, the, next, the, reverse, pick, drill, executed, in, groups, of, 4, or, 6, isolates, different, aspects, of, the, drive, sequence, with, the, boat, checked, down, the, boat, has, no, speed, rowers, initiate, the, drill, with, leg, only, strokes, gradually, adding, the, back, and, arms, the, emphasis, is, on, maintaining, proper, body, position, and, sitting, tall, throughout, the, exercise, this, drill, aids, in, isolating, and, understanding, the, distinct, elements, of, the, drive, sequence, and, their, interconnectedness, the, cut, the, cake, drill, typically, involves, the, entire, boat, rowers, execute, the, drill, collectively, starting, with, a, normal, stroke, and, transitioning, into, the, subsequent, recovery, during, this, process, the, entire, crew, pivots, forward, with, their, bodies, swings, back, to, the, finish, without, letting, the, oars, drop, in, the, water, then, swings, forward, again, to, reach, the, catch, position, the, swinging, motion, referred, to, as, cutting, the, cake, involves, coordinated, movements, by, all, rowers, creating, a, unified, and, synchronized, exercise, aimed, at, improving, boat, balance, swing, and, recovery, timing, designed, for, the, entire, crew, or, smaller, groups, this, drill, involves, rowing, using, only, a, quarter, or, half, of, the, slide, at, a, high, rating, with, a, full, press, it, sharpens, quick, catches, and, emphasizes, coordination, during, the, recovery, phase, the, square, wide, 6, drill, conducted, in, groups, of, 6, or, 4, requires, rowers, to, take, a, wide, grip, on, the, oar, handle, emphasizing, a, specific, body, position, during, the, recovery, this, encourages, proper, body, positioning, and, enhances, body, flexibility, feet, out, rowing, performed, either, collectively, by, all, rowers, or, in, smaller, groups, involves, the, removal, of, feet, from, the, shoes, and, placement, of, feet, on, top, of, the, shoes, this, drill, helps, rowers, maintain, continuous, pressure, on, the, footboard, especially, during, oar, release, despite, challenges, like, early, leg, finishing, or, excessive, layback, feet, out, rowing, reinforces, improved, leg, connection, and, more, reasonable, layback, translating, on, the, water, skills, to, the, erg, for, a, more, efficient, rowing, experience, in, the, eyes, closed, rowing, drill, performed, by, the, whole, boat, rowers, execute, the, rowing, motion, with, closed, eyes, and, heightened, auditory, awareness, rowers, row, with, eyes, closed, relying, solely, on, their, sense, of, touch, and, careful, listening, to, the, boat, motion, and, the, coxswain, this, drill, is, designed, to, enhance, rowers, ability, to, feel, the, subtle, movements, of, the, boat, and, synchronize, seamlessly, with, their, teammates, by, eliminating, the, visual, element, rowers, focus, on, developing, a, heightened, sense, of, touch, and, teamwork, fostering, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, rowing, experience, this, drill, enhances, the, overall, coordination, and, sensitivity, to, the, dynamics, of, the, boat, contributing, to, improved, synchronization, and, a, more, nuanced, rowing, performance, broadly, there, are, two, ways, to, row, sometimes, called, disciplines, within, each, discipline, there, are, several, boat, classes, a, single, regatta, series, of, races, will, often, feature, races, for, many, boat, classes, they, are, classified, using, although, sweep, and, sculling, boats, are, generally, identical, to, each, other, except, having, different, riggers, they, are, referred, to, using, different, names, sweep, boat, classes, sculling, boat, classes, racing, boats, often, called, shells, are, long, narrow, and, broadly, semi, circular, in, cross, section, in, order, to, reduce, drag, in, the, water, there, is, some, trade, off, between, boat, speed, and, stability, in, choice, of, hull, shape, they, usually, have, a, fin, towards, the, rear, to, help, prevent, roll, and, yaw, and, to, increase, the, effectiveness, of, the, rudder, originally, made, from, wood, shells, are, now, almost, always, made, from, a, composite, material, usually, a, double, skin, of, carbon, fiber, reinforced, plastic, with, a, sandwich, of, honeycomb, material, for, strength, and, weight, advantages, world, rowing, rules, specify, minimum, weights, for, each, class, of, boat, so, that, no, individual, team, will, gain, a, great, advantage, from, the, use, of, expensive, materials, or, technology, smaller, sculling, boats, are, usually, steered, by, the, scullers, pulling, harder, on, one, side, or, the, other, while, larger, boats, often, have, a, rudder, controlled, by, the, coxswain, if, present, or, by, one, of, the, crew, using, a, cable, attached, to, one, of, the, shoes, with, the, smaller, boats, specialist, versions, of, the, shells, for, sculling, can, be, made, lighter, the, riggers, in, sculling, apply, the, forces, symmetrically, to, each, side, of, the, boat, whereas, in, sweep, oared, racing, these, forces, are, staggered, alternately, along, the, boat, the, sweep, oared, boat, has, to, be, stiffer, to, handle, these, unmatched, forces, so, consequently, requires, more, bracing, and, is, usually, heavier, a, pair, 2, is, usually, a, more, robust, boat, than, a, double, scull, 2x, for, example, and, being, heavier, is, also, slower, when, used, as, a, double, scull, in, theory, this, could, also, apply, to, the, 4x, and, 8x, but, most, rowing, clubs, cannot, afford, to, have, a, dedicated, large, hull, which, might, be, rarely, used, and, instead, generally, opt, for, versatility, in, their, fleet, by, using, stronger, shells, which, can, be, rigged, for, either, sweep, rowing, or, sculling, the, symmetrical, forces, also, make, sculling, more, efficient, than, sweep, rowing, the, double, scull, is, faster, than, the, coxless, pair, and, the, quadruple, scull, is, faster, than, the, coxless, four, many, adjustments, can, be, made, to, the, equipment, to, accommodate, the, physiques, of, the, crew, collectively, these, adjustments, are, known, as, the, boat, s, rigging, oars, sometimes, referred, to, as, blades, are, used, to, propel, the, boat, they, are, long, sculling, 250, 300, cm, sweep, oar, 340, 360, cm, poles, with, one, flat, end, about, 50, cm, long, and, 25, cm, wide, called, the, spoon, classic, blades, were, made, out, of, wood, but, modern, blades, are, made, from, more, expensive, and, durable, synthetic, material, the, most, common, being, carbon, fiber, an, oar, is, often, referred, to, as, a, blade, in, the, case, of, sweep, oar, rowing, and, as, a, scull, in, the, case, of, sculling, a, sculling, oar, is, shorter, and, has, a, smaller, spoon, area, than, the, equivalent, sweep, oar, the, combined, spoon, area, of, a, pair, of, sculls, is, however, greater, than, that, of, a, single, sweep, oar, so, the, oarsman, when, sculling, is, working, against, more, water, than, when, rowing, sweep, oared, they, are, able, to, do, this, because, the, body, action, in, sculling, is, more, anatomically, efficient, due, to, the, symmetry, the, spoon, of, oars, is, normally, painted, with, the, colours, of, the, club, to, which, they, belong, this, greatly, simplifies, identification, of, boats, at, a, distance, as, many, sports, teams, have, logos, printed, on, their, jerseys, rowing, clubs, have, specifically, painted, blades, that, each, team, is, associated, with, indoor, rowing, on, indoor, rower, or, rowing, tank, is, a, way, to, train, technique, and, strength, by, going, through, the, same, motions, as, rowing, with, resistance, usually, a, large, tank, of, water, indoor, rowing, is, helpful, when, there, are, no, rowable, bodies, of, water, near, by, or, weather, conditions, don, t, permit, rowing, a, rowing, tank, is, an, indoor, facility, which, attempts, to, mimic, the, conditions, rowers, face, on, open, water, rowing, tanks, are, used, primarily, for, off, season, rowing, muscle, specific, conditioning, and, technique, training, or, simply, when, bad, weather, prevents, open, water, training, ergometer, rowing, machines, colloquially, ergs, or, ergo, simulate, the, rowing, action, and, provide, a, means, of, training, on, land, when, waterborne, training, is, restricted, and, of, measuring, rowing, fitness, ergometers, do, not, simulate, the, lateral, balance, challenges, the, exact, resistance, of, water, or, the, exact, motions, of, true, rowing, including, the, sweep, of, the, oar, handles, for, that, reason, ergometer, scores, are, generally, not, used, as, the, sole, selection, criterion, for, crews, colloquially, ergs, don, t, float, and, technique, training, is, limited, to, the, basic, body, position, and, movements, however, this, action, can, still, allow, a, workout, comparable, to, those, experienced, on, the, water, indoor, rowing, has, become, popular, as, a, sport, in, its, own, right, with, numerous, indoor, competitions, and, the, annual, world, championship, crash, b, sprints, in, boston, during, the, winter, off, season, there, are, several, formats, for, rowing, races, often, called, regattas, the, two, most, common, are, side, by, side, and, head, races, most, races, that, are, held, in, the, spring, and, summer, feature, side, by, side, or, sprint, racing, all, the, boats, start, at, the, same, time, from, a, stationary, position, and, the, winner, is, the, boat, that, crosses, the, finish, line, first, the, number, of, boats, in, a, race, typically, varies, between, two, which, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, dual, race, to, eight, but, any, number, of, boats, can, start, together, if, the, course, is, wide, enough, the, standard, length, races, for, the, olympics, and, the, world, rowing, championships, is, 2, kilometres, 1, 24, mi, long, in, the, united, states, some, scholastic, high, school, races, are, 1, 5, kilometres, 0, 93, mi, while, many, youth, races, are, the, standard, 2, kilometres, masters, rowers, rowers, older, than, 27, often, race, 1, 000m, however, the, race, distance, can, and, does, vary, from, dashes, or, sprints, which, may, be, 500, metres, 1, 640, ft, long, to, longer, dual, races, like, the, 6, 8, kilometres, 4, 2, mi, boat, race, two, traditional, non, standard, distance, shell, races, are, the, annual, boat, race, between, oxford, and, cambridge, and, the, harvard, yale, boat, race, which, cover, courses, of, approximately, 4, miles, 6, 44, km, the, henley, royal, regatta, is, also, raced, upon, a, non, standard, distance, at, 2, 112, meters, 1, mile, 550, yards, in, general, multi, boat, competitions, are, organized, in, a, series, of, rounds, with, the, fastest, boats, in, each, heat, qualifying, for, the, next, round, the, losing, boats, from, each, heat, may, be, given, a, second, chance, to, qualify, through, a, repechage, the, world, rowing, championships, offers, multi, lane, racing, in, heats, finals, and, repechages, at, henley, royal, regatta, two, crews, compete, side, by, side, in, each, round, in, a, straightforward, knock, out, format, with, no, repechages, head, races, are, time, trial, processional, races, that, take, place, from, autumn, fall, to, early, spring, depending, on, local, conditions, boats, begin, with, a, rolling, start, at, intervals, of, 10, 20, seconds, and, are, timed, over, a, set, distance, head, courses, usually, vary, in, length, from, 2, 000, metres, 1, 24, mi, to, 12, 000, metres, 7, 46, mi, though, there, are, longer, races, such, as, the, boston, rowing, marathon, and, shorter, such, as, pairs, head, the, oldest, and, arguably, most, famous, head, race, is, the, head, of, the, river, race, founded, by, steve, fairbairn, in, 1926, which, takes, place, each, march, on, the, river, thames, in, london, united, kingdom, head, racing, was, exported, to, the, united, states, in, the, 1950s, and, the, head, of, the, charles, regatta, held, each, october, on, the, charles, river, in, boston, massachusetts, united, states, is, now, the, largest, rowing, event, in, the, world, these, processional, races, are, known, as, head, races, because, as, with, bumps, racing, the, fastest, crew, is, awarded, the, title, head, of, the, river, as, in, head, of, the, class, it, was, not, deemed, feasible, to, run, bumps, racing, on, the, tideway, so, a, timed, format, was, adopted, and, soon, caught, on, time, trials, are, sometimes, used, to, determine, who, competes, in, an, event, where, there, is, a, limited, number, of, entries, for, example, the, qualifying, races, for, henley, royal, regatta, and, rowing, on, and, getting, on, for, the, oxford, and, cambridge, bumps, races, respectively, a, bumps, race, is, a, multi, day, race, beginning, with, crews, lined, up, along, the, river, at, set, intervals, they, start, simultaneously, and, all, pursue, the, boat, ahead, while, avoiding, being, bumped, by, a, boat, from, behind, if, a, crew, overtakes, or, makes, physical, contact, with, the, crew, ahead, a, bump, is, awarded, as, a, result, damage, to, boats, and, equipment, is, common, during, bumps, racing, to, avoid, damage, the, cox, of, the, crew, being, bumped, may, concede, the, bump, before, contact, is, actually, made, the, next, day, the, bumping, crew, will, start, ahead, of, any, crews, that, have, been, bumped, the, positions, at, the, end, of, the, last, race, are, used, to, set, the, positions, on, the, first, day, of, the, races, the, next, year, oxford, and, cambridge, universities, hold, bumps, races, for, their, respective, colleges, twice, a, year, and, there, are, also, town, bumps, races, in, both, cities, open, to, non, university, crews, oxford, s, races, are, organised, by, city, of, oxford, rowing, club, and, cambridge, s, are, organised, by, the, cambridgeshire, rowing, association, the, stake, format, was, often, used, in, early, american, races, competitors, line, up, at, the, start, race, to, a, stake, moored, boat, or, buoy, some, distance, away, and, return, the, 180, turn, requires, mastery, of, steering, these, races, are, popular, with, spectators, because, one, may, watch, both, the, start, and, finish, usually, only, two, boats, would, race, at, once, to, avoid, collision, the, green, mountain, head, regatta, continues, to, use, the, stake, format, but, it, is, run, as, a, head, race, with, an, interval, start, a, similar, type, of, racing, is, found, in, uk, and, irish, coastal, rowing, where, a, number, of, boats, race, out, to, a, given, point, from, the, coast, and, then, return, fighting, rough, water, all, the, way, in, irish, coastal, rowing, the, boats, are, in, individual, lanes, with, the, races, consisting, of, up, to, 3, turns, to, make, the, race, distance, 2, 3, km, rowers, in, multi, rower, boats, are, numbered, sequentially, from, the, bow, aft, the, number, one, rower, is, called, the, bowman, or, just, bow, whilst, the, rower, closest, to, the, stern, is, called, the, strokeman, or, just, stroke, there, are, some, exceptions, to, this, some, uk, coastal, rowers, and, in, france, spain, and, italy, rowers, number, from, stern, to, bow, in, addition, to, this, certain, crew, members, have, other, titles, and, roles, in, an, 8, the, stern, pair, are, responsible, for, setting, the, stroke, rate, and, rhythm, for, the, rest, of, the, boat, to, follow, the, middle, four, sometimes, called, the, engine, room, or, power, house, are, usually, the, less, technical, but, more, powerful, rowers, in, the, crew, whilst, the, bow, pair, are, the, more, technical, and, generally, regarded, as, the, pair, to, set, up, the, balance, of, the, boat, they, also, have, most, influence, on, the, line, the, boat, steers, the, coxswain, or, simply, the, cox, is, the, member, who, steers, the, boat, using, rudder, strings, and, coordinates, the, power, and, rhythm, of, the, rowers, by, communicating, to, the, crew, often, through, a, device, called, a, cox, box, and, speakers, the, cox, usually, sits, in, the, stern, of, the, boat, facing, the, rowers, but, in, bowloaders, usually, seen, in, the, coxed, four, and, coxed, pair, types, of, boat, the, coxswain, lies, in, the, bow, the, cox, is, usually, the, smallest, and, lightest, out, of, all, the, crew, it, is, an, advantage, for, the, coxswain, to, be, light, as, this, requires, less, effort, for, the, crew, to, propel, the, boat, in, many, competitive, events, there, is, a, minimum, weight, 55, kilograms, 121, lb, under, world, rowing, rules, set, for, the, coxswain, to, prevent, unfair, advantage, if, a, coxswain, is, under, the, minimum, weight, allowance, underweight, they, may, have, to,

generate, protective, calluses, holding, the, oars, too, tightly, or, making, adjustments, to, technique, may, cause, recurring, or, new, blisters, as, it, is, common, to, feather, the, blade, another, common, injury, is, getting, track, bites, thin, cuts, on, the, back, of, one, s, calf, or, thigh, caused, by, contact, with, the, seat, tracks, at, either, end, of, the, stroke
