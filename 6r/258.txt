which, have, sex, ratios, of, 108, and, above, are, usually, presumed, as, engaging, in, sex, selection, however, deviations, in, sex, ratios, at, birth, can, occur, for, natural, causes, too, nevertheless, the, practice, of, bias, against, girls, through, sex, selective, abortion, female, infanticide, female, abandonment, as, well, as, favouring, sons, with, regard, to, allocating, of,

not, fully, understood, identical, twin, girls, separated, at, birth, and, reunited, decades, later, have, shown, both, startling, similarities, and, differences, in, 2005, professor, kim, wallen, of, emory, university, noted, i, think, the, nature, versus, nurture, question, is, not, meaningful, because, it, treats, them, as, independent, factors, whereas, in, fact, everything, is, nature, and, nurture, femininity, is, a, set, of, attributes, behaviours, and, roles, generally, associated, with, girls, and, women, femininity, is, socially, constructed, but, made, up, of, both, socially, defined, and, biologically, created, factors, this, makes, it, distinct, from, the, definition, of, the, biological, female, sex, as, both, males, and, females, can, exhibit, feminine, traits, traits, traditionally, cited, as, feminine, include, gentleness, empathy, and, sensitivity, though, traits, associated, with, femininity, vary, depending, on, location, and, context, and, are, influenced, by, a, variety, of, social, and, cultural, factors, gender, neutrality, describes, the, idea, that, policies, language, and, other, social, institutions, should, avoid, distinguishing, roles, according, to, people, s, sex, or, gender, in, order, to, avoid, discrimination, arising, from, rigid, gender, roles, unisex, refers, to, things, that, are, considered, appropriate, for, any, sex, campaigns, for, unisex, toys, include, let, toys, be, toys, teenage, pregnancy, is, pregnancy, in, an, adolescent, girl, a, female, can, become, pregnant, from, sexual, intercourse, after, she, has, begun, to, ovulate, pregnant, teenagers, face, many, of, the, same, pregnancy, related, issues, as, other, women, there, are, however, additional, concerns, for, young, adolescents, as, they, are, less, likely, to, be, physically, developed, enough, to, sustain, a, healthy, pregnancy, or, to, give, birth, in, developed, countries, teenage, pregnancy, is, usually, associated, with, social, issues, including, lower, educational, levels, poverty, and, other, negative, life, outcomes, and, often, carries, a, social, stigma, by, contrast, teenage, girls, in, developing, countries, are, often, married, and, their, pregnancies, welcomed, by, family, and, society, however, in, these, societies, child, marriage, and, early, pregnancy, often, combine, with, malnutrition, and, poor, health, care, and, create, medical, problems, girls, equal, access, to, education, has, been, achieved, in, some, countries, but, there, are, significant, disparities, in, the, majority, there, are, gaps, in, access, between, different, regions, and, countries, and, even, within, countries, girls, account, for, 60, percent, of, children, out, of, school, in, arab, countries, and, 66, percent, of, non, attendees, in, south, and, west, asia, however, more, girls, than, boys, attend, schools, in, many, countries, in, latin, america, the, caribbean, north, america, and, western, europe, research, has, measured, the, economic, cost, of, this, inequality, to, developing, countries, plan, international, s, analysis, shows, that, a, total, of, 65, low, middle, income, and, transition, countries, fail, to, offer, girls, the, same, secondary, school, opportunities, as, boys, and, in, total, these, countries, are, missing, out, on, annual, economic, growth, of, an, estimated, 92, billion, although, the, international, covenant, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, has, asserted, primary, education, shall, be, compulsory, and, available, free, to, all, girls, are, slightly, less, likely, to, be, enrolled, as, students, in, primary, and, secondary, schools, 70, 74, and, 59, 65, worldwide, efforts, have, been, made, to, end, this, disparity, such, as, through, the, millennium, development, goals, and, the, gap, has, closed, since, 1990, according, to, kim, wallen, expectations, will, nonetheless, play, a, role, in, how, girls, perform, academically, for, example, if, females, skilled, in, math, are, told, a, test, is, gender, neutral, they, achieve, high, scores, but, if, they, are, told, males, outperformed, females, in, the, past, the, females, will, do, much, worse, what, s, strange, is, wallen, observed, according, to, the, research, all, one, apparently, has, to, do, is, tell, a, woman, who, has, a, lifetime, of, socialization, of, being, poor, in, math, that, a, math, test, is, gender, neutral, and, all, effects, of, that, socialization, go, away, author, judith, harris, has, said, that, aside, from, their, genetic, contribution, the, nurturing, provided, by, parents, likely, has, less, long, term, influence, over, their, offspring, than, other, environmental, aspects, such, as, the, children, s, peer, group, in, england, studies, by, the, national, literacy, trust, have, shown, girls, score, consistently, higher, than, boys, in, all, scholastic, areas, from, the, ages, of, 7, through, 16, with, the, most, striking, differences, noted, in, reading, and, writing, skills, in, the, united, states, historically, girls, lagged, on, standardized, tests, in, 1996, the, average, score, of, 503, for, us, girls, from, all, races, on, the, sat, verbal, test, was, 4, points, lower, than, boys, in, math, the, average, for, girls, was, 492, which, was, 35, points, lower, than, boys, when, girls, take, the, exact, same, courses, commented, wayne, camara, a, research, scientist, with, the, college, board, that, 35, point, gap, dissipates, quite, a, bit, at, the, time, leslie, r, wolfe, president, of, the, center, for, women, policy, studies, said, girls, scored, differently, on, the, math, tests, because, they, tend, to, work, the, problems, out, while, boys, use, test, taking, tricks, such, as, immediately, checking, the, answers, already, given, in, multiple, choice, questions, wolfe, said, girls, are, steady, and, thorough, while, boys, play, this, test, like, a, pin, ball, machine, wolfe, also, said, although, girls, had, lower, sat, scores, they, consistently, get, higher, grades, than, boys, across, all, courses, in, their, first, year, in, college, by, 2006, girls, were, outscoring, boys, on, the, verbal, portion, of, the, united, states, nationwide, sat, exam, by, 11, points, a, 2005, university, of, chicago, study, showed, that, a, majority, presence, of, girls, in, the, classroom, tends, to, enhance, the, academic, performance, of, boys, in, many, parts, of, the, world, girls, face, significant, obstacles, to, accessing, proper, education, these, obstacles, include, early, and, forced, marriages, early, pregnancy, prejudice, based, on, gender, stereotypes, at, home, at, school, and, in, the, community, violence, on, the, way, to, school, or, in, and, around, schools, long, distances, to, schools, vulnerability, to, the, hiv, epidemic, school, fees, which, often, lead, to, parents, sending, only, their, sons, to, school, lack, of, gender, sensitive, approaches, and, materials, in, classrooms, sex, segregation, is, the, physical, legal, and, cultural, separation, of, people, according, to, their, biological, sex, it, is, practiced, in, many, societies, especially, starting, when, children, attain, puberty, in, certain, circumstances, sex, segregation, is, controversial, some, critics, contend, that, it, is, a, violation, of, capabilities, and, human, rights, and, can, create, economic, inefficiencies, and, discrimination, while, some, supporters, argue, that, it, is, central, to, certain, religious, laws, and, social, and, cultural, histories, and, traditions, purdah, is, a, religious, and, social, practice, of, female, seclusion, prevalent, among, some, muslim, and, hindu, communities, in, south, asia, it, takes, two, forms, physical, segregation, of, the, sexes, and, the, requirement, that, women, cover, almost, entirely, their, bodies, the, ages, from, which, this, practice, is, enforced, vary, by, community, such, practices, are, most, common, in, cultures, where, the, concept, of, family, honor, is, very, strong, in, cultures, where, sex, segregation, is, common, the, predominant, form, of, education, in, single, sex,
