ioc, recognized, special, olympics, world, games, include, athletes, with, intellectual, disabilities, although, since, 1992, people, with, intellectual, disabilities, also, participate, in, the,

international, wheelchair, games, and, were, intended, to, coincide, with, the, 1948, olympics, guttman, s, aim, was, to, create, an, elite, sports, competition, for, people, with, disabilities, that, would, be, equivalent, to, the, olympic, games, the, games, were, held, at, the, same, location, each, year, and, in, 1952, dutch, and, israeli, veterans, took, part, alongside, the, british, making,

summer, olympics, which, were, also, being, held, in, rome, these, were, to, be, later, designated, the, 1st, paralympic, games, these, early, competitions, have, been, described, as, the, precursors, of, the, paralympic, games, and, stoke, mandeville, holds, a, similar, place, in, the, history, of, the, paralympic, movement, as, greece, holds, in, the, olympic, games, since, 2012, the, paralympic, flame, has, incorporated, a, heritage, flame, lit, at, stoke, mandeville, although, it, was, combined, with, flames, lit, in, the, host, country, for, the, formal, start, of, the, torch, relay, beginning, in, 2024, future, paralympic, torch, relays, will, officially, begin, in, stoke, mandeville, as, an, equivalent, to, the, olympic, flame, being, created, in, olympia, there, have, been, several, milestones, in, the, paralympic, movement, the, first, official, paralympic, games, coincident, with, the, ninth, stoke, mandeville, games, but, no, longer, open, solely, to, war, veterans, was, held, in, rome, in, 1960, they, were, the, brainchild, of, antonio, maglio, a, friend, and, follower, of, guttmann, and, were, financed, almost, entirely, by, maglio, s, employer, the, workers,

classifications, the, 1976, summer, games, expanded, to, 1, 600, athletes, from, 40, countries, the, 1988, summer, paralympics, in, seoul, was, another, milestone, for, the, paralympic, movement, it, was, in, seoul, that, the, paralympic, summer, games, were, held, directly, after, the, 1988, summer, olympics, in, the, same, host, city, and, using, the, majority, of, the, venues, this, set, a, precedent, that, was, followed, in, 1992, 1996, and, 2000, it, was, eventually, formalized, in, an, agreement, between, the, international, paralympic, committee, ipc, and, the, international, olympic, committee, ioc, in, 2001, and, was, extended, through, 2020, on, march, 10, 2018, the, two, committees, further, extended, their, contract, to, 2032, despite, being, held, in, the, same, region, the, 1992, winter, paralympics, used, different, competition, venues, than, those, used, for, the, olympic, games, 1994, winter, paralympics, were, the, first, winter, games, to, use, the, same, venues, and, had, the, same, organizing, committee, as, the, winter, olympics, the, first, winter, paralympic, games, were, held, in, 1976, in, rnsk, ldsvik, sweden, this, was, the, first, paralympics, in, which, multiple, categories, of, athletes, with, disabilities, could, compete, the, winter, games, were, celebrated, every, four, years, on, the, same, year, as, their, summer, counterpart, just, as, the, olympics, were, this, tradition, was, upheld, through, the, 1992, games, in, albertville, france, after, that, beginning, with, the, 1994, games, the, winter, paralympics, and, the, winter, olympics, have, been, held, in, those, even, numbered, years, separate, from, the, summer, olympics, the, winter, games, happen, two, years, after, the, summer, games, the,

sporting, federations, international, federations, are, independent, sport, federations, recognized, by, the, ipc, as, the, sole, representative, of, a, paralympic, sport, international, federations, responsibilities, include, technical, jurisdiction, and, guidance, over, the, competition, and, training, venues, of, their, respective, sports, during, the, paralympic, games, the, ipc, also, recognizes, media, partners, certifies, officials, judges, and, is, responsible, for, enforcing, the, bylaws, of, the, paralympic, charter, since, its, creation, in, 1989, ipc, has, a, cooperative, relationship, with, the, international, olympic, committee, ioc, delegates, of, the, ipc, are, also, members, of, the, ioc, and, participate, on, ioc, committees, and, commissions, the, two, governing, bodies, remain, distinct, with, separate, games, despite, the, close, working, relationship, the, paralympic, games, were, designed, to, emphasize, the, participants, athletic, achievements, and, not, their, disability, recent, games, have, emphasized, that, these, games, are, about, ability, and, not, disability, the, movement, has, grown, dramatically, since, its, early, days, for, example, the, number, of, athletes, participating, in, the, summer, paralympic, games, has, increased, from, 400, athletes, in, rome, in, 1960, to, 4, 342, athletes, from, 159, countries, in, rio, de, janeiro, in, 2016, both, the, paralympic, summer, and, winter, games, are, recognized, on, the, world, stage, unlike, the, olympic, games, english, is, the, official, language, of, the, paralympic, movement, the, other, languages, used, at, each, paralympic, games, are, the, official, languages, of, the, host, country, or, host, region, every, proclamation, such, as, the, announcement, of, each, country, during, the, parade, of, nations, in, the, opening, ceremony, is, spoken, in, these, two, or, more, languages, although, the, name, was, originally, coined, as, a, portmanteau, combining, paraplegic, due, to, its, origins, as, games, for, people, with, spinal, injuries, and, olympic, the, inclusion, of, other, disability, groups, meant, that, this, was, no, longer, considered, very, accurate, the, present, formal, explanation, for, the, name, is, that, it, derives, from, the, greek, preposition, par, beside, or, alongside, and, thus, refers, to, a, competition, held, in, parallel, with, the, olympic, games, the, summer, games, of, 1988, held, in, seoul, was, the, first, time, the, term, paralympic, came, into, official, use, spirit, in, motion,

widely, represented, in, the, flags, of, nations, the, colours, are, each, in, the, shape, of, an, agito, which, is, latin, for, i, move, i, shake, i, stir, which, is, the, name, given, to, an, asymmetrical, crescent, specially, designed, for, the, paralympic, movement, the, three, agitos, circle, a, central, point, which, is, a, symbol, for, the, athletes, congregating, from, all, points, of, the, globe, the, motto, and, symbol, of, the, ipc, were, changed, in, 2003, to, their, current, versions, the, change, was, intended, to, convey, the, idea, that, paralympians, have, a, spirit, of, competition, and, that, the, ipc, as, an, organization, realizes, its, potential, and, is, moving, forward, to, achieve, it, the, vision, of, the, ipc, is, to, enable, paralympic, athletes, to,

international, paralympic, committee, ipc, signed, an, agreement, that, would, ensure, that, the, staging, of, the, paralympic, games, is, automatically, included, in, the, bid, for, the, olympic, games, the, agreement, was, set, to, take, effect, at, the, 2008, paralympic, summer, games, in, beijing, and, the, 2010, paralympic, winter, games, in, vancouver, however, the, salt, lake, 2002, organizing, committee, sloc, chose, to, follow, the, practice, of, one, bid, one, city, with, one, organizing, committee, for, both, games, which, was, followed, up, by, the, 2004, summer, games, in, athens, the, agreement, was, adjusted, in, 2003, an, extension, was, signed, in, june, 2006, after, some, troubles, at, the, 2006, winter, paralympics, initially, agreed, to, remain, in, effect, until, the, 2012, summer, olympics, this, was, later, extended, to, encompass, all, summer, and, winter, games, up, until, the, 2020, summer, olympics, even, beyond, this, all, summer, and, winter, host, cities, currently, announced, are, preparing, pairs, of, olympic, and, paralympics, games, this, was, further, confirmed, when, on, 10, march, 2018, the, ioc, and, the, ipc, agreed, to, further, extend, the, contract, to, the, 2032, summer, olympics, the, ioc, has, written, its, commitment, to, equal, access, to, athletics, for, all, people, into, its, charter, which, states, the, practice, of, sport, is, a, human, right, every, individual, must, have, the, possibility, of, practising, sport, without, discrimination, of, any, kind, and, in, the, olympic, spirit, which, requires, mutual, understanding, with, a, spirit, of, friendship, solidarity, and, fair, play, any, form, of, discrimination, with, regard, to, a, country, or, a, person, on, grounds, of, race, religion, politics, gender, or, otherwise, is, incompatible, with, belonging, to, the, olympic, movement, while, the, charter, is, silent, on, discrimination, specifically, related, to, disability, given, the, language, in, the, charter, regarding, discrimination, it, is, reasonable, to, infer, that, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, disability, would, be, against, the, ideals, of, the, olympic, charter, and, the, ioc, this, is, also, consistent, with, the, paralympic, charter, which, forbids, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, political, religious, economic, disability, gender, sexual, orientation, or, racial, reasons, chairman, of, the, london, organising, committee, sebastian, coe, said, about, the, 2012, summer, paralympics, and, 2012, summer, olympics, in, london, england, that, we, want, to, change, public, attitudes, towards, disability, celebrate, the, excellence, of, paralympic, sport, and, to, enshrine, from, the, very, outset, that, the, two, games, are, an, integrated, whole, the, 2014, winter, paralympic, games, is, the, first, such, paralympics, hosted, by, russia, russia, ratified, the, un, convention, on, the, rights, of, persons, with, disabilities, during, that, period, notably, at, 2010, vancouver, their, paralympic, team, topped, the, medal, table, at, the, winter, paralympics, while, their, olympic, team, performed, well, below, expectations, at, the, winter, olympics, this, led, the, media, to, highlight, the, contrast, between, the, achievements, of, the, country, s, olympic, and, paralympic, delegations, despite, the, greater, attention, and, funding, awarded, to, the, olympic, athletes, the, russian, federation, organizers, of, the, 2014, winter, paralympic, games, have, since, 2007, made, efforts, to, make, the, host, city, sochi, more, accessible, in, 2012, as, part, of, its, prohibition, on, unauthorised, advertising, the, paralympic, movement, began, requiring, any, tattoo, of, the, olympic, rings, to, be, covered, during, competition, on, the, basis, that, the, olympics, is, technically, a, third, party, organisation, in, 2024, the, prohibition, was, ended, after, protests, from, athletes, paralympic, athletes, have, sought, equal, opportunities, to, compete, at, the, olympic, games, the, precedent, was, set, by, neroli, fairhall, a, paralympic, archer, from, new, zealand, who, competed, at, the, 1984, summer, olympics, in, los, angeles, in, 2008, oscar, pistorius, a, south, african, sprinter, attempted, to, qualify, for, the, 2008, summer, olympics, pistorius, had, both, his, legs, amputated, below, the, knee, and, races, with, two, carbon, fibre, blades, manufactured, by, ssur, he, holds, the, paralympic, world, record, in, the, 400, meter, event, pistorius, missed, qualifying, for, the, 2008, summer, olympics, in, the, 400, meter, race, by, 0, 70, seconds, he, qualified, for, the, 2008, summer, paralympics, where, he, won, gold, medals, in, the, 100, 200, and, 400, meter, sprints, in, 2011, pistorius, qualified, for, the, 2012, summer, olympics, and, competed, in, two, events, he, made, the, semi, final, in, the, 400, metres, race, and, his, team, came, 8th, in, the, final, of, the, 4, 400, metres, relay, race, even, though, all, athletes, are, given, equal, opportunities, to, participate, in, these, events, such, as, the, 400, meter, race, there, has, been, growing, criticism, that, the, games, may, not, be, fair, to, all, athletes, for, example, athletes, running, a, race, with, a, left, prosthetic, leg, may, be, disadvantaged, compared, to, those, with, a, right, side, prosthesis, because, the, races, are, run, in, an, anticlockwise, direction, giving, some, athletes, an, advantage, some, athletes, without, a, disability, also, compete, at, the, paralympics, the, sighted, guides, for, athletes, with, a, visual, impairment, are, such, a, close, and, essential, part, of, the, competition, that, the, athlete, with, visual, impairment, and, the, guide, are, considered, a, team, and, both, athletes, are, medal, candidates, starting, at, the, 1992, summer, paralympics, recent, games, have, also, been, supported, by, contributions, from, major, sponsors, unlike, the, olympics, where, the, ioc, mandates, that, arenas, be, clean, of, sponsor, logos, the, paralympics, do, allow, the, logos, of, official, sponsors, to, be, displayed, inside, arenas, and, on, uniforms, while, the, olympic, games, have, experienced, tremendous, growth, in, global, media, coverage, since, the, 1984, summer, paralympics, the, paralympics, had, been, slower, to, develop, a, consistent, mainstream, media, presence, in, june, 2023, ipc, executives, noted, that, interest, in, the, paralympics, had, been, improving, among, broadcasters, citing, that, that, it, had, already, reached, rights, deals, for, the, 2024, summer, paralympics, covering, 75, of, the, world, over, a, year, in, advance, in, comparison, to, 2020, where, many, deals, were, made, last, minute, and, that, it, had, been, pushing, for, broader, coverage, and, increased, rights, fees, since, broadcasters, were, starting, to, that, actually, a, great, sporting, event, and, not, treat, them, as, a, low, effort, obligation, bundled, with, their, olympics, rights, unlike, the, olympics, the, ipc, holds, the, digital, rights, to, the, paralympics, in, some, markets, allowing, it, to, promote, live, coverage, and, other, highlights, via, its, own, social, media, platforms, to, engage, online, audiences, television, broadcasts, of, paralympic, games, began, in, 1976, but, this, early, coverage, was, confined, to, tape, delayed, broadcasts, to, one, nation, or, region, at, the, 1992, summer, paralympics, there, were, 45, hours, of, live, coverage, but, it, was, available, only, in, europe, other, countries, broadcast, highlight, packages, during, the, games, no, meaningful, improvements, in, coverage, occurred, until, the, 2000, summer, paralympics, in, sydney, the, 2000, paralympics, represented, a, significant, increase, in, global, media, exposure, for, the, paralympic, games, a, deal, was, reached, between, the, sydney, paralympic, organizing, committee, spoc, and, all, media, sports, ams, to, broadcast, the, games, internationally, deals, were, reached, with, asian, south, american, and, european, broadcast, companies, to, distribute, coverage, to, as, many, markets, as, possible, the, games, were, also, webcast, for, the, first, time, because, of, these, efforts, the, sydney, paralympics, reached, a, global, audience, estimated, at, 300, million, people, also, significant, was, the, fact, that, the, organizers, did, not, have, to, pay, networks, to, televise, the, games, as, had, been, done, at, the, 1992, and, 1996, games, despite, these, advances, consistent, media, attention, has, been, a, challenge, which, was, evidenced, in, the, coverage, in, great, britain, of, the, 2010, winter, paralympics, the, bbc, was, criticized, for, its, minimal, coverage, of, the, 2010, winter, paralympics, as, compared, to, its, coverage, of, the, 2010, winter, olympics, the, bbc, announced, it, would, stream, some, content, on, its, website, and, show, a, one, hour, highlight, program, after, the, games, ended, for, the, winter, olympics, the, bbc, aired, 160, hours, of, coverage, the, response, from, the, bbc, was, that, budget, constraints, and, the, time, zone, factor, necessitated, a, limited, broadcast, schedule, the, reduction, in, coverage, was, done, in, spite, of, increased, ratings, for, the, 2008, summer, paralympics, which, was, watched, by, 23, of, the, population, of, great, britain, in, norway, the, norwegian, broadcasting, corporation, nrk, broadcast, 30, hours, of, the, 2010, winter, games, live, nrk, sport, were, critical, of, parts, of, the, tv, production, from, vancouver, and, notified, the, ebu, of, issues, such, as, the, biathlon, coverage, excluding, the, shooting, and, cross, country, skiing, with, skiers, in, the, distance, making, it, hard, to, follow, the, progress, of, the, competition, nrk, were, far, more, pleased, with, the, production, of, the, ice, sledge, hockey, and, wheelchair, curling, events, which, they, felt, reached, the, same, level, as, the, olympic, games, not, all, paralympic, events, have, received, television, coverage, the, ipc, and, its, organisers, currently, contract, with, the, ioc, s, media, unit, olympic, broadcasting, services, obs, to, produce, the, broadcast, feeds, for, the, paralympics, at, the, summer, paralympics, coverage, was, limited, to, 16, sports, in, 2016, but, increased, to, 19, sports, in, 2020, in, 2024, all, 22, summer, paralympic, sports, were, televised, for, the, first, time, in, the, uk, channel, 4, assumed, the, television, rights, beginning, in, the, 2012, summer, paralympics, promising, major, increases, in, coverage, on, television, and, digital, platforms, efforts, to, heighten, the, games, profile, and, commitments, to, incorporate, people, with, disabilities, among, its, staff, and, presenters, its, coverage, of, the, paralympics, have, been, promoted, through, major, marketing, campaigns, several, of, its, advertisements, have, won, cannes, lions, awards, with, its, trailer, for, 2016, we, re, the, superhumans, receiving, an, overall, grand, prix, award, in, january, 2020, the, paralympics, were, classified, as, a, category, a, listed, event, by, the, british, telecom, regulator, ofcom, as, with, the, olympics, mandating, that, they, be, broadcast, in, whole, or, in, part, by, a, free, to, air, network, channel, 4, reported, that, its, coverage, of, the, 2024, summer, paralympics, was, seen, by, a, total, audience, of, 20, million, with, the, channel, achieving, its, highest, viewer, share, since, the, 2012, paralympics, a, 2010, study, by, the, university, of, british, columbia, ubc, on, the, olympic, games, impact, ogi, showed, that, of, roughly, 1, 600, canadian, respondents, 41, to, 50, percent, believed, the, 2010, paralympic, and, olympic, games, in, vancouver, british, columbia, canada, triggered, additional, accessibility, of, buildings, sidewalks, and, public, spaces, 23, percent, of, employers, said, the, games, had, increased, their, willingness, to, hire, people, with, disabilities, chief, executive, officer, for, the, international, paralympic, committee, xavier, gonzalez, said, about, the, 2008, summer, paralympics, in, beijing, china, that, in, china, the, paralympic, games, were, really, a, transformation, tool, for, changing, attitudes, across, the, board, in, china, towards, people, with, disability, to, building, accessibility, facilities, in, the, city, to, changing, laws, to, allow, people, with, a, disability, to, be, part, of, society, within, the, framework, of, the, international, olympic, committee, s, commitment, to, equal, access, to, athletics, concerns, have, been, raised, regarding, inclusion, of, athletes, with, down, syndrome, in, the, paralympic, games, while, the, paralympic, movement, strives, for, inclusivity, the, absence, of, a, specific, classification, for, athletes, with, down, syndrome, within, paralympic, swimming, events, raises, questions, about, equal, and, fair, competition, for, down, syndrome, athletes, international, paralympic, committee, para, swimming, classification, codes, are, based, upon, single, impairment, only, whereas, down, syndrome, individuals, have, both, physical, and, intellectual, impairments, although, swimmers, with, down, syndrome, are, able, to, compete, in, the, s14, intellectual, impairment, category, provided, they, score, low, in, iq, tests, they, are, often, outmatched, by, the, superior, physicality, of, their, opponents, at, present, there, is, no, designated, paralympic, category, for, swimmers, with, down, syndrome, meaning, they, have, to, compete, as, intellectually, disadvantaged, athletes, this, disregards, their, physical, disabilities, a, number, of, advocacy, groups, globally, have, been, lobbying, for, the, inclusion, of, a, distinct, classification, category, for, down, syndrome, swimmers, within, the, ipc, classification, codes, framework, initiatives, aimed, at, promoting, greater, inclusivity, within, the, paralympic, movement, have, emerged, including, advocacy, and, awareness, raising, efforts, targeting, discrimination, and, ensuring, equal, opportunities, for, athletes, with, down, syndrome, despite, ongoing, advocacy, the, issue, remains, unresolved, and, swimmers, with, down, syndrome, continue, to, face, challenges, in, accessing, appropriate, classification, pathways, the, international, paralympic, committee, ipc, has, established, ten, disability, categories, athletes, are, divided, within, each, category, according, to, their, level, of, impairment, in, a, functional, classification, system, which, differs, from, sport, to, sport, the, ipc, has, established, ten, disability, categories, including, physical, visual, and, intellectual, impairment, athletes, with, one, of, these, disabilities, can, compete, in, the, paralympics, though, not, every, sport, can, allow, for, every, disability, category, these, categories, apply, to, both, summer, and, winter, paralympics, physical, impairment, there, are, eight, different, types, of, physical, impairment, visual, impairment, athletes, with, visual, impairment, ranging, from, partial, vision, sufficient, to, be, judged, legally, blind, to, total, blindness, this, includes, impairment, of, one, or, more, component, of, the, visual, system, eye, structure, receptors, optic, nerve, pathway, and, visual, cortex, the, sighted, guides, for, athletes, with, a, visual, impairment, are, such, a, close, and, essential, part, of, the, competition, that, the, athlete, with, visual, impairment, and, the, guide, are, considered, a, team, beginning, in, 2012, these, guides, along, with, sighted, goalkeepers, in, 5, a, side, football, became, eligible, to, receive, medals, of, their, own, intellectual, disability, athletes, with, a, significant, intellectual, impairment, and, associated, limitations, in, adaptive, behaviour, the, ipc, primarily, serves, athletes, with, physical, disabilities, but, the, disability, group, intellectual, disability, has, been, added, to, some, paralympic, games, this, includes, only, elite, athletes, with, intellectual, disabilities, diagnosed, before, the, age, of, 18, however, the, ioc, recognized, special, olympics, world, games, are, open, to, all, people, with, intellectual, disabilities, within, the, disability, categories, athletes, are, further, divided, into, sport, classes, according, to, the, degree, of, activity, limitation, resulting, from, their, impairments, this, aims, to, minimise, the, impact, of, an, athlete, s, impairment, on, their, sporting, performance, against, their, rivals, sport, classes, are, numbered, with, a, lower, number, signifying, a, greater, level, of, impairment, for, example, in, paralympic, swimming, athletes, with, visual, impairments, compete, in, three, sport, classes, from, s, sb11, to, s, sb13, with, s, sb11, athletes, having, a, very, low, light, acuity, and, or, no, light, perception, and, s, sb13, athletes, having, the, least, severe, visual, impairment, eligible, for, paralympic, sport, from, its, inception, until, the, 1980s, the, paralympic, system, for, classifying, athletes, consisted, of, a, medical, evaluation, and, diagnosis, of, impairment, an, athlete, s, medical, condition, was, the, only, factor, used, to, determine, what, class, they, competed, in, for, example, an, athlete, who, had, a, spinal, cord, injury, that, resulted, in, lower, limb, paresis, would, not, compete, in, the, same, wheelchair, race, as, an, athlete, with, a, double, above, knee, amputation, the, fact, that, their, disability, caused, the, same, impairment, did, not, factor, into, classification, determination, the, only, consideration, was, their, medical, diagnosis, it, was, not, until, views, on, disabled, athletics, shifted, from, just, a, form, of, rehabilitation, to, an, end, in, itself, that, the, classification, system, changed, from, medical, diagnosis, to, a, focus, on, the, functional, abilities, of, the, athlete, while, there, is, no, clear, date, when, the, shift, occurred, a, functional, classification, system, became, the, norm, for, disabled, athletic, classification, in, the, 1980s, in, a, functional, system, the, focus, is, on, what, effect, the, athlete, s, impairment, has, on, his, or, her, athletic, performance, under, this, system, athletes, with, total, loss, of, function, in, their, legs, will, compete, together, in, most, sports, because, their, functional, loss, is, the, same, and, the, reason, for, the, loss, is, immaterial, the, only, exception, to, the, functional, system, is, the, classification, format, used, by, international, blind, sports, federation, ibsa, which, still, uses, a, medically, based, system, some, sports, are, only, held, for, certain, disability, types, for, example, goalball, is, only, for, visually, impaired, athletes, the, paralympics, recognizes, three, different, grades, of, visual, impairment, consequently, all, competitors, in, goalball, must, wear, a, visor, or, black, out, mask, so, that, athletes, with, less, visual, impairment, will, not, have, an, advantage, other, sports, like, athletics, are, open, to, athletes, with, a, wide, variety, of, impairments, in, athletics, participants, are, broken, down, into, a, range, of, classes, based, on, the, disability, they, have, and, then, they, are, placed, in, a, classification, within, that, range, based, on, their, level, of, impairment, for, example, classes, 11, 13, are, for, visually, impaired, athletes, which, class, they, are, in, depends, on, their, level, of, visual, impairment, there, are, also, team, competitions, such, as, wheelchair, rugby, members, of, the, team, are, each, given, a, point, value, based, on, their, activity, limitation, a, lower, score, indicates, a, more, severe, activity, limitation, than, a, higher, score, a, team, cannot, have, more, than, a, certain, maximum, total, of, points, on, the, field, of, play, at, the, same, time, to, ensure, equal, competition, for, example, in, wheelchair, rugby, the, four, players, combined, disability, number, must, total, no, more, than, eight, points, there, are, twenty, two, sports, on, the, summer, paralympic, program, and, six, sports, on, the, winter, paralympics, program, within, some, of, the, sports, are, several, events, for, example, alpine, skiing, has, downhill, super, combined, super, g, slalom, giant, slalom, the, ipc, has, governance, over, several, of, the, sports, but, not, all, of, them, other, international, organizations, known, as, international, sports, federations, if, notably, the, international, wheelchair, and, amputee, sports, federation, iwas, the, international, blind, sports, federation, ibsa, and, the, cerebral, palsy, international, sports, and, recreation, association, cp, isra, govern, some, sports, that, are, specific, to, certain, disability, groups, there, are, national, chapters, for, these, international, sport, federations, including, national, paralympic, committees, which, are, responsible, for, recruitment, of, athletes, and, governance, of, sports, at, the, national, level, after, the, 2000, sydney, games, a, spanish, basketball, player, alleged, that, several, members, of, the, gold, medal, winning, spanish, basketball, team, with, intellectual, disabilities, id, did, not, have, disabilities, he, claimed, that, only, two, athletes, out, of, the, twelve, member, team, met, the, qualifications, of, an, athlete, with, an, intellectual, disability, a, controversy, ensued, and, the, international, paralympic, committee, ipc, called, on, the, spanish, national, paralympic, committee, to, launch, an, investigation, the, investigation, uncovered, several, spanish, athletes, who, had, flouted, the, id, rules, in, an, interview, with, the, president, of, the, federation, that, oversees, id, competition, fernando, mart, n, vicente, admitted, that, athletes, around, the, world, were, breaking, the, id, eligibility, rules, the, ipc, responded, by, starting, an, investigation, of, its, own, the, results, of, the, ipc, s, investigation, confirmed, the, spanish, athlete, s, allegations, and, also, determined, that, the, incident, was, not, isolated, to, the, basketball, id, event, or, to, spanish, athletes, as, a, result, all, id, competitions, were, suspended, indefinitely, the, ban, was, lifted, after, the, 2008, games, after, work, had, been, done, to, tighten, the, criteria, and, controls, governing, admission, of, athletes, with, intellectual, disabilities, four, sports, swimming, athletics, table, tennis, and, rowing, were, anticipated, to, hold, competitions, for, id, athletes, at, the, 2012, summer, paralympics, the, paralympics, have, also, been, tainted, by, steroid, use, at, the, 2008, games, in, beijing, three, powerlifters, and, a, german, basketball, player, were, banned, after, having, tested, positive, for, banned, substances, this, was, a, decrease, in, comparison, to, the, ten, powerlifters, and, one, track, athlete, who, were, banned, from, the, 2000, games, german, skier, thomas, oelsner, became, the, first, winter, paralympian, to, test, positive, for, steroids, he, had, won, two, gold, medals, at, the, 2002, winter, paralympics, but, his, medals, were, stripped, after, his, positive, drug, test, at, the, 2010, winter, paralympics, in, vancouver, swedish, curler, glenn, ikonen, tested, positive, for, a, banned, substance, and, was, suspended, for, six, months, by, the, ipc, he, was, removed, from, the, rest, of, the, curling, competition, but, his, team, was, allowed, to, continue, the, 54, year, old, curler, said, his, doctor, had, prescribed, a, medication, on, the, banned, substances, list, another, concern, now, facing, paralympic, officials, is, the, technique, of, boosting, athletes, can, artificially, increase, their, blood, pressure, often, by, self, harming, which, has, been, shown, to, improve, performance, by, up, to, 15, this, is, most, effective, in, the, endurance, sports, such, as, cross, country, skiing, to, increase, blood, pressure, athletes, will, deliberately, cause, trauma, to, limbs, below, a, spinal, injury, this, trauma, can, include, breaking, bones, strapping, extremities, in, too, tightly, and, using, high, pressure, compression, stockings, the, injury, is, painless, but, it, does, affect, the, athlete, s, blood, pressure, another, potential, concern, is, the, use, of, gene, therapy, among, paralympic, athletes, all, paralympic, athletes, are, banned, from, enhancing, their, abilities, through, gene, doping, but, it, is, extremely, difficult, to, differentiate, these, concepts, the, world, anti, doping, agency, wada, is, currently, researching, both, gene, doping, and, gene, therapy, in, part, to, discern, the, boundary, between, the, two, closely, related, concepts, the, ipc, have, been, working, with, wada, since, 2003, to, ensure, compliance, with, wada, s, anti, doping, code, among, its, paralympic, athletes, the, ipc, has, also, promised, to, continue, increasing, the, number, of, athletes, tested, at, each, of, its, games, in, order, to, further, minimize, the, possible, effect, of, doping, in, paralympic, sports, mandatory, in, and, out, of, competition, testing, has, also, been, implemented, by, the, ipc, to, further, ensure, all, of, its, athletes, are, performing, in, compliance, with, wada, regulations, having, sent, samples, for, forensic, analysis, the, ipc, found, evidence, that, the, prevalent, doping, by, russian, athletes, was, in, operation, at, the, 2014, winter, paralympics, in, sochi, on, 7, august, 2016, the, ipc, s, governing, board, voted, unanimously, to, ban, the, entire, russian, team, from, the, 2016, summer, paralympics, citing, the, russian, paralympic, committee, s, inability, to, enforce, the, ipc, s, anti, doping, code, and, the, world, anti, doping, code, which, is, a, fundamental, constitutional, requirement, ipc, president, sir, philip, craven, stated, that, the, russian, government, had, catastrophically, failed, its, para, athletes, ipc, athletes, council, chairperson, and, cpc, member, todd, nicholson, said, that, russia, had, used, athletes, as, pawns, in, order, to, show, global, prowess, trischa, zorn, of, the, united, states, is, the, most, decorated, paralympian, in, history, she, competed, in, the, blind, swimming, events, and, won, a, total, of, 55, medals, 41, of, which, are, gold, her, paralympic, career, spanned, 24, years, from, 1980, to, 2004, she, was, also, an, alternate, on, the, 1980, american, olympic, swim, team, but, did, not, go, to, the, olympics, due, to, a, boycott, by, the, united, states, and, several, of, its, allies, ragnhild, myklebust, of, norway, holds, the, record, for, the, most, medals, ever, won, at, the, winter, paralympic, games, competing, in, a, variety, of, events, between, 1988, and, 2002, she, won, a, total, of, 22, medals, of, which, 17, were, gold, after, winning, five, gold, medals, at, the, 2002, games, she, retired, at, the, age, of, 58, neroli, fairhall, a, paraplegic, archer, from, new, zealand, was, the, first, paraplegic, competitor, and, the, third, paralympian, to, participate, in, the, olympic, games, when, she, competed, in, the, 1984, summer, olympics, in, los, angeles, she, placed, thirty, fourth, in, the, olympic, archery, competition, and, won, a, paralympic, gold, medal, in, the, same, event, a, postponed, to, 2021, due, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, marking, the, first, time, that, the, paralympic, games, has, been, postponed, they, are, still, called, the, 2020, summer, paralympics, even, with, the, change, in, scheduling, to, one, year, later, the, games, were, held, from, 24, august, to, 5, september, 2021
