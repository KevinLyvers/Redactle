year, a, decision, to, change, this, was, made, in, 1986, when, during, the, 91st, international, olympic, committee, session, ioc, members, decided, to, alternate, the, summer, olympic, games, and, the, winter, olympic, games, on, separate, four, year, cycles, in, even, numbered, years, also, at, that, same, congress, it, was, decided, that, 1992, winter, olympics, would, be, the, last, to, be,

the, winter, olympic, games, countries, have, used, the, winter, olympic, games, as, well, as, the, summer, olympic, games, to, proclaim, the, superiority, of, their, political, systems, the, winter,

because, they, desired, to, protect, the, integrity, of, the, nordic, games, and, were, concerned, about, a, lack, of, facilities, for, winter, sports, the, idea, was, resurrected, for, the, 1916, games, which, were, to, be, held, in, berlin, germany, a, winter, sports, week, with, speed, skating, figure, skating, ice, hockey, and, nordic, skiing, were, planned, but, the, 1916, olympics, was,

than, in, 1928, as, the, journey, to, lake, placid, was, too, long, and, expensive, for, some, european, nations, that, encountered, financial, problems, in, the, midst, of, the, great, depression, the, athletes, competed, in, fourteen, events, in, four, sports, virtually, no, snow, fell, for, two, months, before, the, games, and, there, was, not, enough, snow, to, hold, all, the, events, until,

february, this, was, the, last, time, the, summer, and, winter, olympics, were, held, in, the, same, country, in, the, same, year, alpine, skiing, made, its, olympic, debut, but, skiing, teachers, were, barred, from, entering, because, they, were, considered, to, be, professionals, because, of, this, decision, the, swiss, and, austrian, skiers, refused, to, compete, at, the, games, world, war, ii, interrupted, the, winter, olympics, the, 1940, games, had, been, awarded, to, sapporo, japan, but, the, decision, was, rescinded, in, 1938, because, of, the, japanese, invasion, of, china, the, games, were, then, to, be, held, at, garmisch, partenkirchen, germany, but, the, 1940, games, were, cancelled, following, the, german, invasion, of, poland, in, 1939, due, to, the, ongoing, war, the, 1944, games, originally, scheduled, for, cortina, d, ampezzo, italy, were, cancelled, st, moritz, was, selected, to, host, the, first, post, war, games, in, 1948, switzerland, s, neutrality, had, protected, the, town, during, world, war, ii, and, most, venues, from, the, 1928, games, remained, in, place, which, made, st, moritz, a, logical, choice, it, became, the, first, city, to, host, a, winter, olympics, twice, twenty, eight, countries, competed, in, switzerland, but, athletes, from, germany, and, japan, were, not, invited, controversy, erupted, when, two, hockey, teams, from, the, united, states, arrived, both, claiming, to, be, the, legitimate, u, s, olympic, hockey, representative, the, olympic, flag, presented, at, the, 1920, summer, olympics, in, antwerp, was, stolen, as, was, its, replacement, there, was, unprecedented, parity, at, these, games, during, which, 10, countries, won, gold, medals, more, than, any, games, to, that, point, the, olympic, flame, tradition, was, introduced, at, the, 1952, games, in, oslo, when, the, flame, was, lit, in, the, fireplace, by, norwegian, skiing, pioneer, sondre, nordheim, and, the, first, winter, torch, relay, was, conducted, by, 94, torchbearers, entirely, on, their, skis, bandy, a, popular, sport, in, the, nordic, countries, was, featured, as, a, demonstration, sport, though, only, norway, sweden, and, finland, fielded, teams, norwegian, athletes, won, 17, medals, which, outpaced, all, the, other, nations, they, were, led, by, hjalmar, andersen, who, won, three, gold, medals, in, four, events, in, the, speed, skating, competition, after, not, being, able, to, host, the, games, in, 1944, cortina, d, ampezzo, was, selected, to, organise, the, 1956, winter, olympics, at, the, opening, ceremonies, the, final, torchbearer, guido, caroli, entered, the, olympic, stadium, on, ice, skates, as, he, skated, around, the, stadium, his, skate, caught, on, a, cable, and, he, fell, and, burned, his, arm, nearly, extinguishing, the, flame, he, was, able, to, recover, and, light, the, cauldron, these, were, the, first, winter, games, to, be, televised, and, the, first, olympics, ever, broadcast, to, an, international, audience, though, no, television, rights, were, sold, until, the, 1960, summer, olympics, in, rome, the, cortina, games, were, used, to, test, the, feasibility, of, televising, large, sporting, events, the, soviet, union, made, its, olympic, debut, and, had, an, immediate, impact, winning, more, medals, than, any, other, nation, the, soviets, immediate, success, might, be, explained, by, the, advent, of, the, state, sponsored, full, time, amateur, athlete, the, ussr, entered, teams, of, athletes, who, were, all, nominally, students, soldiers, or, working, in, a, profession, but, many, of, whom, were, in, reality, paid, by, the, state, to, train, full, time, chiharu, igaya, won, the, first, winter, olympics, medal, for, japan, and, the, continent, of, asia, when, he, placed, second, in, the, slalom, the, ioc, awarded, the, 1960, olympics, to, squaw, valley, united, states, the, announcement, of, its, selection, came, as, a, shock, as, the, resort, was, undeveloped, and, unknown, outside, the, united, states, about, us, 80, 000, 000, was, spent, over, four, years, to, build, the, completely, non, existent, infrastructure, the, opening, and, closing, ceremonies, were, the, firsts, produced, by, walt, disney, company, the, squaw, valley, olympics, was, the, first, winter, games, to, have, a, dedicated, athletes, village, the, first, to, use, a, computer, courtesy, of, ibm, to, tabulate, results, and, the, first, to, feature, female, speed, skating, events, this, edition, is, the, only, one, to, date, to, not, have, bobsleigh, competitions, as, the, number, of, countries, registered, in, the, event, was, insufficient, and, the, costs, of, building, the, track, were, too, high, for, the, organizing, committee, to, replace, the, event, an, extra, edition, from, the, fibt, world, championship, was, held, the, austrian, city, of, innsbruck, was, the, host, in, 1964, for, the, first, time, the, olympic, torch, of, the, winter, olympic, games, was, lit, at, the, traditional, ritual, held, in, the, temple, of, olympia, although, innsbruck, was, a, traditional, winter, sports, resort, unprojected, warm, weather, caused, a, lack, of, snow, and, organisers, were, unable, to, save, enough, snow, to, be, used, during, the, games, and, the, austrian, army, was, enlisted, to, transport, snow, and, ice, from, other, places, to, the, sports, venues, soviet, speed, skater, lidia, skoblikova, made, history, by, winning, all, four, speed, skating, events, her, career, total, of, six, gold, medals, set, a, record, for, winter, olympics, athletes, also, for, the, first, time, luge, was, added, to, the, olympic, program, but, the, sport, received, bad, publicity, when, a, competitor, was, killed, in, a, pre, olympic, training, run, held, in, the, french, town, of, grenoble, the, 1968, winter, olympics, were, the, first, olympic, games, to, be, broadcast, in, colour, there, were, 1, 158, athletes, from, 37, nations, competing, in, 35, events, french, alpine, ski, racer, jean, claude, killy, became, only, the, second, person, to, win, all, the, men, s, alpine, skiing, events, due, the, high, interest, around, the, world, the, organising, committee, sold, television, rights, for, us, 2, million, which, was, more, than, twice, the, cost, of, the, broadcast, rights, for, the, innsbruck, games, for, the, first, time, the, organizers, chose, to, decentralize, the, games, to, save, costs, and, the, events, were, spread, across, three, long, distances, clusters, which, led, to, the, need, to, build, three, olympic, villages, along, the, high, costs, the, organisers, claimed, that, this, was, necessary, to, accommodate, technological, advances, however, critics, disputed, this, alleging, that, the, layout, would, incorporate, the, best, possible, venues, for, television, broadcasts, at, the, athletes, expense, the, 1972, winter, games, held, in, sapporo, japan, were, the, first, to, be, hosted, on, a, continent, other, than, north, america, or, europe, the, issue, of, professionalism, was, disputed, during, these, games, when, a, number, of, alpine, skiers, were, found, to, have, participated, in, a, ski, camp, at, mammoth, mountain, in, the, united, states, three, days, before, the, opening, ceremony, ioc, president, avery, brundage, threatened, to, bar, the, skiers, from, competing, in, the, games, as, he, insisted, that, they, were, no, longer, amateurs, having, benefited, financially, from, their, status, as, athletes, eventually, only, austrian, karl, schranz, who, earned, more, than, the, other, skiers, was, excluded, from, the, competition, canada, boycotted, the, 1972, and, the, 1976, ice, hockey, tournaments, in, protest, at, not, being, able, to, use, players, from, professional, leagues, canadian, authorities, also, accused, the, soviet, union, of, using, state, sponsored, athletes, who, were, de, facto, professionals, francisco, fern, ndez, ochoa, became, the, first, and, as, of, 2022, the, only, spaniard, to, win, a, winter, olympic, gold, medal, when, he, triumphed, in, the, slalom, the, 1976, winter, olympics, had, initially, been, awarded, in, 1970, to, denver, colorado, in, the, united, states, these, games, would, have, coincided, with, the, year, of, colorado, s, centennial, and, the, united, states, bicentennial, however, the, increasing, costs, of, the, event, and, the, oil, crisis, led, to, a, local, plebiscite, held, in, november, 1972, that, resulted, in, the, city, withdrawing, from, hosting, the, games, as, the, people, of, colorado, voted, against, public, funding, of, the, games, by, a, 3, 2, margin, the, ioc, responded, by, offering, the, games, to, vancouver, garibaldi, british, columbia, in, canada, which, had, previously, been, a, finalist, bid, for, the, 1976, games, however, a, change, in, the, provincial, government, resulted, in, an, administration, that, did, not, support, the, olympic, bid, so, the, ioc, s, offer, was, rejected, salt, lake, city, previously, a, candidate, for, the, 1972, winter, olympics, then, put, itself, forward, but, a, tense, political, situation, led, ioc, to, invite, innsbruck, to, host, the, 1976, games, as, all, the, infrastructure, used, during, the, 1964, games, had, been, maintained, despite, only, having, half, the, usual, time, to, prepare, for, the, games, innsbruck, accepted, the, invitation, to, replace, denver, in, february, 1973, during, the, opening, ceremonies, two, cauldrons, were, lit, because, it, was, the, second, time, that, the, austrian, town, had, hosted, the, winter, games, the, 1976, games, featured, the, first, combination, bobsleigh, and, luge, track, in, neighbouring, igls, the, soviet, union, won, its, fourth, consecutive, ice, hockey, gold, medal, in, 1980, the, winter, olympics, returned, to, lake, placid, which, had, hosted, the, 1932, games, unlike, previous, editions, lake, placid, had, no,

the, winter, games, the, republic, of, china, boycoted, the, games, in, protest, of, the, ioc, s, recognition, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, as, the, only, china, and, its, request, for, the, republic, of, china, to, compete, as, chinese, taipei, the, prc, on, the, other, hand, returned, to, the, olympics, for, the, first, time, since, 1952, and, made, its, winter, olympic, debut,

their, investment, for, example, the, 2006, winter, olympics, in, turin, italy, cost, 3, 6, billion, to, host, by, comparison, the, 1998, winter, olympics, in, nagano, japan, cost, 12, 5, billion, the, organisers, of, the, nagano, games, claimed, that, the, cost, of, extending, the, bullet, train, service, from, tokyo, to, nagano, was, responsible, for, the, large, price, tag, the, organising, committee, had, hoped, that, the, exposure, gained, from, hosting, the, winter, olympics, and, the, improved, access, to, nagano, from, tokyo, would, benefit, the, local, economy, for, years, afterwards, in, fact, nagano, s, economy, did, experience, a, post, olympic, boom, for, a, year, or, two, but, the, long, term, effects, have, not, materialised, as, anticipated, the, likelihood, of, heavy, debt, is, a, deterrent, to, prospective, host, cities, as, well, as, the, prospect, of, unused, sports, venues, and, infrastructure, saddling, the, local, community, with, upkeep, costs, with, no, appreciable, post, olympic, value, the, winter, olympics, has, the, added, problem, of, the, alpine, events, requiring, a, mountain, location, the, men, s, downhill, needs, an, 800, metre, altitude, difference, along, a, suitable, course, as, this, is, a, focal, event, that, is, central, to, the, games, the, ioc, has, previously, not, agreed, to, it, taking, place, a, long, way, from, the, main, host, city, in, contrast, to, the, summer, games, where, sailing, and, horse, sports, have, taken, place, more, than, 1, 000, kilometres, 620, mi, away, the, requirement, for, a, mountain, location, also, means, that, venues, such, as, hockey, arenas, often, have, to, be, built, in, sparsely, populated, areas, with, little, future, need, for, a, large, arena, and, for, the, hotels, and, infrastructure, needed, for, all, olympic, visitors, due, to, cost, issues, fewer, and, fewer, cities, are, willing, to, host, both, the, torino, 2006, and, vancouver, 2010, games, which, were, hosted, in, countries, where, large, cities, are, located, close, to, suitable, mountain, regions, had, lower, costs, since, more, venues, hotels, and, transport, infrastructure, already, existed, in, contrast, the, sochi, 2014, games, had, large, costs, as, most, installations, had, to, be, built, the, ioc, has, tried, to, mitigate, these, concerns, firstly, it, has, agreed, to, fund, part, of, the, host, city, s, budget, secondly, the, qualifying, host, countries, are, limited, to, those, that, have, the, resources, and, infrastructure, to, successfully, host, an, olympic, games, without, negatively, impacting, their, region, or, nation, this, rules, out, a, large, portion, of, the, developing, world, finally, any, prospective, host, city, is, required, to, add, a, legacy, plan, to, their, proposal, with, a, view, to, the, long, term, economic, and, environmental, impact, that, hosting, the, olympics, will, have, beginning, with, the, 2022, winter, games, the, ioc, is, allowing, a, longer, distance, between, the, alpine, events, and, other, events, the, oslo, bid, had, 220, kilometres, 140, mi, to, the, kvitfjell, downhill, arena, while, eventual, host, beijing, had, venues, 220, km, away, from, the, city, as, well, for, the, 2026, winter, games, stockholm, s, unsuccessful, bid, proposed, to, hold, the, alpine, event, in, re, 620, kilometres, 390, mi, away, by, road, in, 1967, the, ioc, began, enacting, drug, testing, protocols, they, started, by, randomly, testing, athletes, at, the, 1968, winter, olympics, the, first, winter, games, athlete, to, test, positive, for, a, banned, substance, was, alois, schloder, a, west, german, hockey, player, but, his, team, was, still, allowed, to, compete, during, the, 1970s, testing, outside, of, competition, was, escalated, because, it, was, found, to, deter, athletes, from, using, performance, enhancing, drugs, the, problem, with, testing, during, this, time, was, a, lack, of, standardisation, of, the, test, procedures, which, undermined, the, credibility, of, the, tests, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1980s, that, international, sporting, federations, began, to, coordinate, efforts, to, standardise, the, drug, testing, protocols, the, ioc, took, the, lead, in, the, fight, against, steroids, when, it, established, the, independent, world, anti, doping, agency, wada, in, november, 1999, the, 2006, winter, olympics, in, turin, became, notable, for, a, scandal, involving, the, emerging, trend, of, blood, doping, the, use, of, blood, transfusions, or, synthetic, hormones, such, as, erythropoietin, epo, to, improve, oxygen, flow, and, thus, reduce, fatigue, the, italian, police, conducted, a, raid, on, the, austrian, cross, country, ski, team, s, residence, during, the, games, where, they, seized, blood, doping, specimens, and, equipment, this, event, followed, the, pre, olympics, suspension, of, 12, cross, country, skiers, who, tested, positive, for, unusually, high, levels, of, haemoglobin, which, is, evidence, of, blood, doping, the, 2014, winter, olympics, in, sochi, s, russian, doping, scandal, has, resulted, in, the, international, olympic, committee, to, begin, disciplinary, proceedings, against, 28, later, increased, to, 46, russian, athletes, who, competed, at, the, 2014, winter, games, in, sochi, russia, acting, on, evidence, that, their, urine, samples, were, tampered, with, the, winter, olympics, were, an, ideological, front, in, the, cold, war, since, the, soviet, union, first, participated, at, the, 1956, winter, games, it, did, not, take, long, for, the, cold, war, combatants, to, discover, what, a, powerful, propaganda, tool, the, olympic, games, could, be, the, advent, of, the, state, sponsored, full, time, amateur, athlete, of, the, eastern, bloc, countries, further, eroded, the, ideology, of, the, pure, amateur, as, it, put, the, self, financed, amateurs, of, the, western, countries, at, a, disadvantage, the, soviet, union, entered, teams, of, athletes, who, were, all, nominally, students, soldiers, or, working, in, a, profession, but, many, of, whom, were, in, reality, paid, by, the, state, to, train, on, a, full, time, basis, nevertheless, the, ioc, held, to, the, traditional, rules, regarding, amateurism, until, the, 90s, the, cold, war, created, tensions, amongst, countries, allied, to, the, two, superpowers, the, strained, relationship, between, east, and, west, germany, created, a, difficult, political, situation, for, the, ioc, because, of, its, role, in, world, war, ii, germany, was, not, allowed, to, compete, at, the, 1948, winter, olympics, in, 1950, the, ioc, recognised, the, west, german, olympic, committee, and, invited, east, and, west, germany, to, compete, as, a, unified, team, at, the, 1952, winter, games, east, germany, declined, and, instead, sought, international, legitimacy, separate, from, west, germany, in, 1955, the, soviet, union, recognised, east, germany, as, a, sovereign, state, thereby, giving, more, credibility, to, east, germany, s, campaign, to, become, an, independent, participant, the, ioc, agreed, provisionally, to, accept, the, east, german, national, olympic, committee, on, condition, that, east, and, west, germans, compete, as, one, team, the, situation, became, tense, when, the, berlin, wall, was, constructed, by, east, germany, in, 1961, to, stop, migration, of, its, citizens, and, western, european, nations, began, refusing, visas, to, east, german, athletes, the, uneasy, compromise, of, a, unified, team, held, until, the, 1968, grenoble, games, when, the, ioc, split, the, teams, and, threatened, to, reject, host, city, bids, from, any, country, that, refused, entry, visas, to, east, german, athletes, the, winter, games, have, had, only, one, national, team, boycott, when, taiwan, decided, not, to, participate, in, the, 1980, winter, olympics, held, in, lake, placid, prior, to, the, games, the, ioc, agreed, to, allow, china, to, compete, in, the, olympics, for, the, first, time, since, 1952, china, was, given, permission, to, compete, as, the, people, s, republic, of, china, prc, and, to, use, the, prc, flag, and, anthem, until, 1980, the, island, of, taiwan, had, been, competing, under, the, name, republic, of, china, roc, and, had, been, using, the, roc, flag, and, anthem, the, ioc, attempted, to, have, the, countries, compete, together, but, when, this, proved, to, be, unacceptable, the, ioc, demanded, that, taiwan, cease, to, call, itself, the, republic, of, china, the, ioc, renamed, the, island, chinese, taipei, and, demanded, that, it, adopt, a, different, flag, and, national, anthem, stipulations, to, which, taiwan, would, not, agree, despite, numerous, appeals, and, court, hearings, the, ioc, s, decision, stood, when, the, taiwanese, athletes, arrived, at, the, olympic, village, with, their, republic, of, china, identification, cards, they, were, not, admitted, they, subsequently, left, the, olympics, in, protest, just, before, the, opening, ceremonies, taiwan, returned, to, olympic, competition, at, the, 1984, winter, games, in, sarajevo, as, chinese, taipei, the, country, agreed, to, compete, under, a, flag, bearing, the, emblem, of, their, national, olympic, committee, and, to, play, the, anthem, of, their, national, olympic, committee, should, one, of, their, athletes, win, a, gold, medal, the, agreement, remains, in, place, to, this, day, the, olympic, charter, limits, winter, sports, to, those, sports, which, are, practised, on, snow, or, ice, since, 1992, a, number, of, new, sports, have, been, added, to, the, olympic, programme, which, include, short, track, speed, skating, snowboarding, freestyle, and, moguls, skiing, the, addition, of, these, events, has, broadened, the, appeal, of, the, winter, olympics, beyond, europe, and, north, america, while, european, powers, such, as, norway, and, germany, still, dominate, the, traditional, winter, olympic, sports, countries, such, as, south, korea, australia, and, canada, are, finding, success, in, these, new, sports, the, results, are, more, parity, in, the, national, medal, tables, more, interest, in, the, winter, olympics, and, higher, global, television, ratings, demonstration, sports, have, historically, provided, a, venue, for, host, countries, to, attract, publicity, to, locally,
