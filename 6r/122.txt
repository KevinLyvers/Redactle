flour, is, a, powder, made, by, grinding, raw, grains, roots, beans, nuts, or, seeds, flours, are, used, to, make, many, different, foods, cereal, flour, particularly, wheat, flour, is, the, main, ingredient, of, bread, which, is, a, staple, food, for, many, cultures, corn, flour, has, been, important, in, mesoamerican, cuisine, since, ancient, times, and, remains, a, staple, in, the, americas, rye, flour, is, a, constituent, of, bread, in, both, central, europe, and, northern, europe, cereal, flour, consists, either, of, the, endosperm, germ, and, bran, together, whole, grain, flour, or, of, the, endosperm, alone, refined, flour, meal, is, either, differentiable, from, flour, as, having, slightly, coarser, particle, size, degree, of, comminution, or, is, synonymous, with, flour, the, word, is, used, both, ways, for, example, the, word, cornmeal, often, connotes, a, grittier, texture, whereas, corn, flour, connotes, fine, powder, although, there, is, no, codified, dividing, line, the, cdc, has, cautioned, not, to, eat, raw, flour, doughs, or, batters, raw, flour, can, contain, bacteria, like, e, coli, and, needs, to, be, cooked, like, other, foods, the, english, word, flour, is, originally, a, variant, of, the, word, flower, and, both, words, derive, from, the, old, french, fleur, or, flour, which, had, the, literal, meaning, blossom, and, a, figurative, meaning, the, finest, the, phrase, fleur, de, farine, meant, the, finest, part, of, the, flour, since, flour, resulted, from, the, elimination, of, coarse, and, unwanted, matter, from, the, grain, during, milling, maize, or, corn, flour, has, been, important, in, mesoamerican, cuisine, since, ancient, times, and, remains, a, staple, in, the, americas, rye, flour, is, a, constituent, of, bread, in, central, and, northern, europe, archaeological, evidence, for, making, flour, wheat, seeds, crushed, between, simple, millstones, dates, to, at, least, 6000, bc, in, 2018, archaeologists, reported, finding, evidence, of, bread, making, at, shubayqa, 1, a, natufian, hunter, gatherer, site, more, than, 14, 000, years, old, in, northwest, jordan, the, romans, were, the, first, to, grind, seeds, on, cone, mills, in, 1786, at, the, beginning, of, the, industrial, era, the, first, steam, powered, flour, mill, albion, mills, southwark, was, completed, in, london, in, the, 1930s, some, flour, began, to, be, enriched, with, iron, niacin, thiamine, and, riboflavin, in, the, 1940s, mills, started, to, enrich, flour, and, folic, acid, was, added, to, the, list, in, the, 1990s, an, important, problem, of, the, industrial, revolution, was, the, preservation, of, flour, transportation, distances, and, a, relatively, slow, distribution, system, collided, with, natural, shelf, life, the, reason, for, the, limited, shelf, life, is, the, fatty, acids, of, the, germ, which, react, from, the, moment, they, are, exposed, to, oxygen, this, occurs, when, grain, is, milled, the, fatty, acids, oxidize, and, flour, starts, to, become, rancid, depending, on, climate, and, grain, quality, this, process, takes, six, to, nine, months, in, the, late, 19th, century, this, process, was, too, short, for, an, industrial, production, and, distribution, cycle, as, vitamins, micronutrients, and, amino, acids, were, completely, or, relatively, unknown, in, the, late, 19th, century, removing, the, germ, was, an, effective, solution, without, the, germ, flour, cannot, become, rancid, degermed, flour, became, standard, degermation, started, in, densely, populated, areas, and, took, approximately, one, generation, to, reach, the, countryside, heat, processed, flour, is, flour, where, the, germ, is, first, separated, from, the, endosperm, and, bran, then, processed, with, steam, dry, heat, or, microwave, and, blended, into, flour, again, milling, of, flour, is, accomplished, by, grinding, grain, between, stones, or, steel, wheels, today, stone, ground, usually, means, that, the, grain, has, been, ground, in, a, mill, in, which, a, revolving, stone, wheel, turns, over, a, stationary, stone, wheel, vertically, or, horizontally, with, the, grain, in, between, roller, mills, soon, replaced, stone, grist, mills, as, the, production, of, flour, has, historically, driven, technological, development, as, attempts, to, make, gristmills, more, productive, and, less, labor, intensive, led, to, the, watermill, and, windmill, these, terms, are, now, applied, more, broadly, to, uses, of, water, and, wind, power, for, purposes, other, than, milling, more, recently, the, unifine, mill, an, impact, type, mill, was, developed, in, the, mid, 20th, century, modern, farm, equipment, allows, livestock, farmers, to, do, some, or, all, of, their, own, milling, when, it, comes, time, to, convert, their, own, grain, crops, to, coarse, meal, for, livestock, feed, this, capability, is, economically, important, because, the, profit, margins, are, often, thin, enough, in, commercial, farming, that, saving, expenses, is, vital, to, staying, in, business, flour, contains, a, high, proportion, of, starches, which, are, a, subset, of, complex, carbohydrates, also, known, as, polysaccharides, the, kinds, of, flour, used, in, cooking, include, all, purpose, flour, known, as, plain, outside, north, america, self, rising, flour, and, cake, flour, including, bleached, flour, the, higher, the, protein, content, the, harder, and, stronger, the, flour, and, the, more, it, will, produce, crispy, or, chewy, breads, the, lower, the, protein, the, softer, the, flour, which, is, better, for, cakes, cookies, and, pie, crusts, cereal, flour, consists, either, of, the, endosperm, germ, and, bran, together, whole, grain, flour, or, of, the, endosperm, alone, refined, flour, bleached, flour, is, refined, flour, with, a, chemical, whitening, bleaching, agent, added, refined, flour, has, had, the, germ, and, bran, containing, much, of, the, nutritional, fibre, and, vitamins, removed, and, is, often, referred, to, as, white, flour, bleached, flour, is, artificially, aged, using, a, bleaching, agent, a, maturing, agent, or, both, a, bleaching, agent, affects, the, carotenoids, responsible, for, the, natural, colour, of, the, flour, a, maturing, agent, also, affects, gluten, development, a, maturing, agent, may, either, strengthen, or, weaken, gluten, development, the, four, most, common, additives, used, as, bleaching, maturing, agents, in, the, us, are, some, other, chemicals, used, as, flour, treatment, agents, to, modify, color, and, baking, properties, include, common, preservatives, in, commercial, flour, include, all, bleaching, and, maturing, agents, with, the, possible, exception, of, ascorbic, acid, have, been, banned, in, the, united, kingdom, bromination, of, flour, in, the, us, has, fallen, out, of, favor, and, while, it, is, not, yet, actually, banned, anywhere, few, retail, flours, available, to, the, home, baker, are, bromated, anymore, many, varieties, of, flour, packaged, specifically, for, commercial, bakeries, are, still, bromated, retail, bleached, flour, marketed, to, the, home, baker, is, now, treated, mostly, with, either, peroxidation, or, chlorine, gas, current, information, from, pillsbury, is, that, their, varieties, of, bleached, flour, are, treated, both, with, benzoyl, peroxide, and, chlorine, gas, gold, medal, states, that, their, bleached, flour, is, treated, either, with, benzoyl, peroxide, or, chlorine, gas, but, no, way, exists, to, tell, which, process, has, been, used, when, buying, the, flour, at, the, grocery, store, the, old, method, of, procuring, white, or, bleached, flour, did, not, entail, the, use, of, chemical, agents, at, all, rather, the, wheat, kernels, were, moistened, with, water, long, enough, for, the, outer, kernels, of, the, wheat, which, contained, the, bran, to, soften, and, eventually, fall, off, while, grinding, in, some, places, the, leaves, of, syrian, rue, peganum, harmala, were, spread, in, stratified, layers, between, the, layers, of, grain, and, left, in, such, a, state, for, several, days, until, the, fumes, emitted, from, the, astringent, leaves, of, the, plant, caused, the, outer, kernels, of, the, wheat, to, break, down, and, dissolve, leaving, a, clean, and, white, flour, after, grinding, during, the, process, of, making, flour, specifically, as, a, result, of, the, bleaching, process, nutrients, are, lost, some, of, these, nutrients, may, be, replaced, during, refining, the, result, is, known, as, enriched, flour, cake, flour, is, the, lowest, in, gluten, protein, content, with, 6, 7, 5, 8, from, second, source, protein, to, produce, minimal, binding, so, the, cake, crumbles, easily, pastry, flour, has, the, second, lowest, gluten, protein, content, with, 7, 5, 9, 5, 8, 9, from, second, source, protein, to, hold, together, with, a, bit, more, strength, than, cakes, but, still, produce, flaky, crusts, rather, than, hard, or, crispy, ones, all, purpose, or, ap, flour, or, plain, flour, is, medium, in, gluten, protein, content, at, 9, 5, 11, 5, 10, 12, from, second, source, protein, content, it, has, adequate, protein, content, for, many, bread, and, pizza, bases, though, bread, flour, and, special, 00, grade, italian, flour, are, often, preferred, for, these, purposes, respectively, especially, by, artisan, bakers, some, biscuits, are, also, prepared, using, this, type, of, flour, plain, refers, not, only, to, ap, flour, s, middling, gluten, content, but, also, to, its, lack, of, any, added, leavening, agent, as, in, self, rising, flour, bread, flour, is, typically, made, from, hard, red, winter, wheat, planted, in, the, fall, and, harvested, in, the, spring, hard, wheat, is, high, in, gluten, a, protein, that, makes, dough, stretchy, hard, wheat, is, 11, 5, 13, 5, 12, 14, from, second, source, protein, the, increased, protein, binds, to, the, flour, to, entrap, carbon, dioxide, released, by, the, yeast, fermentation, process, resulting, in, a, better, rise, and, chewier, texture, hard, is, a, general, term, for, flours, with, high, gluten, protein, content, commonly, refers, to, extra, strong, flour, with, 13, 5, 16, or, 14, 15, from, some, sources, protein, 16, is, a, theoretically, possible, protein, content, this, flour, may, be, used, where, a, recipe, adds, ingredients, that, require, the, dough, to, be, extra, strong, to, hold, together, in, their, presence, or, when, strength, is, needed, for, constructions, of, bread, e, g, some, centerpiece, displays, gluten, flour, is, refined, gluten, protein, or, a, theoretical, 100, protein, though, practical, refining, never, achieves, a, full, 100, it, is, used, to, strengthen, flour, as, needed, for, example, adding, approximately, one, teaspoon, per, cup, of, ap, flour, gives, the, resulting, mix, the, protein, content, of, bread, flour, it, is, commonly, added, to, whole, grain, flour, recipes, to, overcome, the, tendency, of, greater, fiber, content, to, interfere, with, gluten, development, needed, to, give, the, bread, better, rising, gas, holding, qualities, and, chew, unbleached, flour, is, simply, flour, that, has, not, undergone, bleaching, and, therefore, does, not, have, the, color, of, white, flour, an, example, is, graham, flour, whose, namesake, sylvester, graham, was, against, using, bleaching, agents, which, he, considered, unhealthy, in, english, speaking, countries, self, raising, or, self, rising, flour, is, commercially, available, with, chemical, leavening, agents, already, in, the, mix, in, america, it, is, also, likely, to, be, pre, salted, in, britain, this, is, not, the, case, the, added, ingredients, are, evenly, distributed, throughout, the, flour, which, aids, a, consistent, rise, in, baked, goods, this, flour, is, generally, used, for, preparing, sponge, cakes, scones, muffins, etc, it, was, invented, by, henry, jones, and, patented, in, 1845, if, a, recipe, calls, for, self, raising, flour, and, this, is, not, available, the, following, substitution, is, possible, wheat, is, the, grain, most, commonly, used, to, make, flour, certain, varieties, may, be, referred, to, as, clean, or, white, flours, contain, differing, levels, of, the, protein, gluten, strong, flour, or, hard, flour, has, a, higher, gluten, content, than, weak, or, soft, flour, brown, and, wholemeal, flours, may, be, made, of, hard, or, soft, wheat, when, flours, do, not, contain, gluten, they, are, suitable, for, people, with, gluten, related, disorders, such, as, coeliac, disease, non, celiac, gluten, sensitivity, or, wheat, allergy, sufferers, among, others, contamination, with, gluten, containing, cereals, can, occur, during, grain, harvesting, transporting, milling, storing, processing, handling, and, or, cooking, flour, also, can, be, made, from, soybeans, arrowroot, taro, cattails, manioc, quinoa, and, other, non, cereal, foodstuffs, in, some, markets, the, different, available, flour, varieties, are, labeled, according, to, the, ash, mass, that, remains, after, a, sample, is, incinerated, in, a, laboratory, oven, typically, at, 550, c, 1, 022, f, or, 900, c, 1, 650, f, see, international, standards, iso, 2171, and, icc, 104, 1, this, is, an, easily, verified, indicator, for, the, fraction, of, the, whole, grain, remains, in, the, flour, because, the, mineral, content, of, the, starchy, endosperm, is, much, lower, than, that, of, the, outer, parts, of, the, grain, flour, made, from, all, parts, of, the, grain, extraction, rate, 100, leaves, about, 2, grams, 0, 071, oz, ash, or, more, per, 100, grams, 3, 5, oz, dry, flour, plain, white, flour, with, an, extraction, rate, of, 50, 60, leaves, about, 0, 4, grams, 0, 014, oz, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, no, numbered, standardized, flour, types, are, defined, and, the, ash, mass, is, only, rarely, given, on, the, label, by, flour, manufacturers, however, the, legally, required, standard, nutrition, label, specifies, the, protein, content, of, the, flour, which, is, also, a, way, for, comparing, the, extraction, rates, of, different, available, flour, types, in, general, as, the, extraction, rate, of, the, flour, increases, so, do, both, the, protein, and, the, ash, content, however, as, the, extraction, rate, approaches, 100, whole, meal, the, protein, content, drops, slightly, while, the, ash, content, continues, to, rise, the, following, table, shows, some, typical, examples, of, how, protein, and, ash, content, relate, to, each, other, in, wheat, flour, this, table, is, only, a, rough, guideline, for, converting, bread, recipes, since, flour, types, are, not, standardized, in, many, countries, the, numbers, may, differ, between, manufacturers, there, is, no, french, type, corresponding, to, the, lowest, ash, residue, in, the, table, the, closest, is, french, type, 45, there, is, no, official, chinese, name, corresponding, to, the, highest, ash, residue, in, the, table, usually, such, products, are, imported, from, japan, and, the, japanese, name, zenryufun, is, used, or, it, is, called, qu, nm, i, mi, nf, n, it, is, possible, to, determine, ash, content, from, some, us, manufacturers, however, us, measurements, are, based, on, wheat, with, a, 14, moisture, content, thus, a, us, flour, with, 0, 48, ash, would, approximate, a, french, type, 55, other, measurable, properties, of, flour, as, used, in, baking, can, be, determined, using, a, variety, of, specialized, instruments, such, as, the, farinograph, flour, dust, suspended, in, air, is, explosive, as, is, any, mixture, of, a, finely, powdered, flammable, substance, with, air, see, dust, explosion, some, devastating, explosions, have, occurred, at, flour, mills, including, an, explosion, in, 1878, at, the, washburn, a, mill, in, minneapolis, that, killed, 22, people, the, cdc, has, cautioned, not, to, eat, raw, flour, doughs, or, batters, raw, flour, can, contain, bacteria, like, e, coli, and, needs, to, be, cooked, like, other, foods, bread, pasta, crackers, many, cakes, and, many, other, foods, are, made, using, flour, wheat, flour, is, also, used, to, make, a, roux, as, a, base, for, thickening, gravy, and, sauces, it, can, also, be, used, as, an, ingredient, in, papier, m, ch, glue, cornstarch, is, a, principal, ingredient, used, to, thicken, many, puddings, or, desserts, and, is, the, main, ingredient, in, packaged, custard
