married, sadako, kano, daughter, of, the, owner, of, kiku, masamune, sake, brewing, company, and, was, adopted, by, the, family, changing, his, name, to, kano, he, ultimately, became, an, official, in, the, shogunate, government, jigoro, kano, had, an, academic, upbringing, and, from, the, age, of, seven, he, studied, english, shod, japanese, calligraphy, and, the, four, confucian, texts, shisho, under, a, number, of, tutors, when, he, was, fourteen, kano, began, boarding, at, an, english, medium, school, ikuei, gijuku, in, shiba, tokyo, the, culture, of, bullying, endemic, at, this, school, was, the, catalyst, that, caused, kano, to, seek, out, a, j, jutsu, jujutsu, d, j, d, j, training, place, at, which, to, train, early, attempts, to, find, a, jujutsu, teacher, who, was, willing, to, take, him, on, met, with, little, success, jujutsu, had, become, unfashionable, in, an, increasingly, westernized, japan, many, of, those, who, had, once, taught, the, art, had, been, forced, out, of, teaching, or, become, so, disillusioned, with, it, that, they, had, simply, given, up, nakai, umenari, an, acquaintance, of, kan, s, father, and, a, former, soldier, agreed, to, show, him, kata, but, not, to, teach, him, the, caretaker, of, jirosaku, s, second, house, katagiri, ryuji, also, knew, jujutsu, but, would, not, teach, it, as, he, believed, it, was, no, longer, of,

a, student, at, the, university, of, tokyo, kano, learned, that, many, jujutsu, teachers, had, been, forced, to, pursue, alternative, careers, frequently, opening, seikotsu, in, traditional, osteopathy, practices, after, inquiring, at, a, number, of, these, kano, was, referred, to, fukuda, hachinosuke, c, 1828, 1880, a, teacher, of, the, tenjin, shin, y, ry, of, jujutsu, who, had, a, small, nine, mat, d, j, where, he, taught, five, students, fukuda, is, said, to, have, emphasized, technique, over, formal, exercise, sowing, the, seeds, of, kano, s, emphasis, on, randori, randori, free, practice, in, judo, on, fukuda, s, death, in, 1880, kano, who, had, become, his, keenest, and, most, able, student, in, both, randori, and, kata, was, given, the, densho, scrolls, of, the, fukuda, d, j, kano, chose, to, continue, his, studies, at, another, tenjin, shin, y, ry, school, that, of, iso, masatomo, c, 1820, 1881, iso, placed, more, emphasis, on, the, practice, of, kata, and, entrusted, randori, instruction, to, assistants, increasingly, to, kano, iso, died, in, june, 1881, and, kano, went, on, to, study, at, the, d, j, of, iikubo, tsunetoshi, 1835, 1889, of, kit, ry, like, fukuda, iikubo, placed, much, emphasis, on, randori, with, kit, ry, having, a, greater, focus, on, nage, waza, throwing, techniques, in, february, 1882, kano, founded, a, school, and, d, j, at, the, eisho, ji, a, buddhist, temple, in, what, was, then, the, shitaya, ward, of, tokyo, now, the, higashi, ueno, district, of, tait, ward, iikubo, kano, s, kit, ry, instructor, attended, the, d, j, three, days, a, week, to, help, teach, and, although, two, years, would, pass, before, the, temple, would, be, called, by, the, name, k, d, kan, kodokan, place, for, expounding, the, way, and, kano, had, not, yet, received, his, menkyo, certificate, of, mastery, in, kit, ry, this, is, now, regarded, as, the, kodokan, founding, the, eisho, ji, d, j, was, originally, shoin, it, was, a, relatively, small, affair, consisting, of, a, 12, jo, 214, sq, ft, training, area, kano, took, in, resident, and, non, resident, students, the, first, two, being, tomita, tsunejir, and, shiro, saigo, in, august, the, following, year, the, pair, were, granted, shodan, first, rank, grades, the, first, that, had, been, awarded, in, any, martial, art, central, to, kano, s, vision, for, judo, were, the, principles, of, seiryoku, zen, y, maximum, efficiency, minimum, effort, and, jita, ky, ei, mutual, welfare, and, benefit, he, illustrated, the, application, of, seiryoku, zen, y, with, the, concept, of, j, yoku, g, o, seisu, softness, controls, hardness, in, short, resisting, a, more, powerful, opponent, will, result, in, your, defeat, whilst, adjusting, to, and, evading, your, opponent, s, attack, will, cause, him, to, lose, his, balance, his, power, will, be, reduced, and, you, will, defeat, him, this, can, apply, whatever, the, relative, values, of, power, thus, making, it, possible, for, weaker, opponents, to, beat, significantly, stronger, ones, this, is, the, theory, of, ju, yoku, go, o, seisu, kano, realised, that, seiryoku, zen, y, initially, conceived, as, a, jujutsu, concept, had, a, wider, philosophical, application, coupled, with, the, confucianist, influenced, jita, ky, ei, the, wider, application, shaped, the, development, of, judo, from, a, bujutsu, martial, art, to, a, bud, martial, way, kano, rejected, techniques, that, did, not, conform, to, these, principles, and, emphasized, the, importance, of, efficiency, in, the, execution, of, techniques, he, was, convinced, that, practice, of, jujutsu, while, conforming, to, these, ideals, was, a, route, to, self, improvement, and, the, betterment, of, society, in, general, he, was, however, acutely, conscious, of, the, japanese, public, s, negative, perception, of, jujutsu, at, the, time, a, few, bujitsu, martial, arts, experts, still, existed, but, bujitsu, was, almost, abandoned, by, the, nation, at, large, even, if, i, wanted, to, teach, jujitsu, most, people, had, now, stopped, thinking, about, it, so, i, thought, it, better, to, teach, under, a, different, name, principally, because, my, objectives, were, much, wider, than, jujitsu, kano, believed, that, j, jutsu, was, insufficient, to, describe, his, art, although, jutsu, means, art, or, means, it, implies, a, method, consisting, of, a, collection, of, physical, techniques, accordingly, he, changed, the, second, character, to, d, meaning, way, road, or, path, which, implies, a, more, philosophical, context, than, jutsu, and, has, a, common, origin, with, the, chinese, concept, of, tao, thus, kano, renamed, it, j, d, judo, there, are, three, basic, categories, of, waza, techniques, in, judo, nage, waza, throwing, techniques, katame, waza, grappling, techniques, and, atemi, waza, striking, techniques, judo, is, mostly, known, for, nage, waza, and, katame, waza, judo, practitioners, typically, devote,

including, ushiro, ukemi, rear, breakfalls, yoko, ukemi, side, breakfalls, mae, ukemi, front, breakfalls, and, zenpo, kaiten, ukemi, rolling, breakfalls, the, person, who, performs, a, waza, is, known, as, tori, literally, taker, and, the, person, to, whom, it, is, performed, is, known, as, uke, receiver, nage, waza, include, all, techniques, in, which, tori, attempts, to, throw, or, trip, uke, usually, with, the, aim, of, placing, uke, on, their, back, each, technique, has, three, distinct, stages, nage, waza, are, typically, drilled, by, the, use, of, uchi, komi, repeated, turning, in, taking, the, throw, up, to, the, point, of, kake, traditionally, nage, waza, are, further, categorised, into, tachi, waza, standing, techniques, throws, that, are, performed, with, tori, maintaining, an, upright, position, and, sutemi, waza, sacrifice, techniques, throws, in, which, tori, sacrifices, his, upright, position, in, order, to, throw, uke, tachi, waza, are, further, subdivided, into, te, waza, hand, techniques, in, which, tori, predominantly, uses, their, arms, to, throw, uke, koshi, waza, hip, techniques, throws, that, predominantly, use, a, lifting, motion, from, the, hips, and, ashi, waza, foot, and, leg, techniques, throws, in, which, tori, predominantly, utilises, their, legs, katame, waza, is, further, categorised, into, osaekomi, waza, holding,

of, other, joints, can, be, found, in, various, kata, such, as, katame, no, kata, and, kodokan, goshin, jutsu, atemi, waza, are, techniques, in, which, tori, disables, uke, with, a, strike, to, a, vital, point, atemi, waza, are, not, permitted, outside, of, kata, judo, pedagogy, emphasizes, randori, literally, taking, chaos, but, meaning, free, practice, this, term, covers, a, variety, of, forms, of, practice, and, the, intensity, at, which, it, is, carried, out, varies, depending, on, intent, and, the, level, of, expertise, of, the, participants, at, one, extreme, is, a, compliant, style, of, randori, known, as, yakusoku, geiko, prearranged, practice, in, which, neither, participant, offers, resistance, to, their, partner, s, attempts, to, throw, a, related, concept, is, that, of, sute, geiko, throw, away, practice, in, which, an, experienced, judoka, allows, himself, to, be, thrown, by, his, less, experienced, partner, at, the, opposite, extreme, from, yakusoku, geiko, is, the, hard, style, of, randori, that, seeks, to, emulate, the, style, of, judo, seen, in, competition, while, hard, randori, is, the, cornerstone, of, judo, over, emphasis, of, the, competitive, aspect, is, seen, as, undesirable, by, traditionalists, if, the, intent, of, the, randori, is, to, win, rather, than, to, learn, kata, kata, forms, are, pre, arranged, patterns, of, techniques, and, in, judo, with, the, exception, of, elements, of, the, seiryoku, zen, y, kokumin, taiiku, they, are, all, practised, with, a, partner, their, purposes, include, illustrating, the, basic, principles, of, judo, demonstrating, the, correct, execution, of, a, technique, teaching, the, philosophical, tenets, upon, which, judo, is, based, allowing, for, the, practice, of, techniques, that, are, not, allowed, in, randori, and, to, preserve, ancient, techniques, that, are, historically, important, but, are, no, longer, used, in, contemporary, judo, there, are, ten, kata, that, are, recognized, by, the, kodokan, today, in, addition, there, are, a, number, of, commonly, practiced, kata, that, are, not, recognised, by, the, kodokan, some, of, the, more, common, kata, include, contest, shiai, is, a, vitally, important, aspect, of, judo, in, 1899, kano, was, asked, to, chair, a, committee, of, the, dai, nippon, butoku, kai, to, draw, up, the, first, formal, set, of, contest, rules, for, jujutsu, these, rules, were, intended, to, cover, contests, between, different, various, traditional, schools, of, jujutsu, as, well, as, practitioners, of, kodokan, judo, contests, were, 15, minutes, long, and, were, judged, on, the, basis, of, nage, waza, and, katame, waza, excluding, atemi, waza, wins, were, by, two, ippons, awarded, in, every, four, main, different, path, of, winning, alternatives, by, throwing, where, the, opponent, s, back, strikes, flat, onto, the, mat, with, sufficient, force, by, pinning, them, on, their, back, for, a, sufficient, amount, of, time, or, by, submission, which, could, be, achieved, via, shime, waza, or, kansetsu, waza, in, which, the, opponent, was, forced, to, give, himself, or, herself, up, or, summon, a, referee, s, or, corner, judge, s, stoppage, finger, toe, and, ankle, locks, were, prohibited, in, 1900, these, rules, were, adopted, by, the, kodokan, with, amendments, made, to, prohibit, all, joint, locks, for, kyu, grades, and, added, wrist, locks, to, the, prohibited, kansetsu, waza, for, dan, grades, it, was, also, stated, that, the, ratio, of, tachi, waza, to, ne, waza, should, be, between, 70, and, 80, for, kyu, grades, and, between, 60, and, 70, for, dan, grades, in, 1916, additional, rulings, were, brought, in, to, further, limit, kansetsu, waza, with, the, prohibition, of, ashi, garami, and, neck, locks, as, well, as, do, jime, these, were, further, added, to, in, 1925, jigoro, kano, for, a, long, time, wished, to, see, judo, as, an, olympic, discipline, the, first, time, judo, was, seen, in, the, olympic, games, was, in, an, informal, demonstration, hosted, by, kano, at, the, 1932, games, however, kano, was, ambivalent, about, judo, s, potential, inclusion, as, an, olympic, sport, i, have, been, asked, by, people, of, various, sections, as, to, the, wisdom, and, possibility, of, judo, being, introduced, with, other, games, and, sports, at, the, olympic, games, my, view, on, the, matter, at, present, is, rather, passive, if, it, be, the, desire, of, other, member, countries, i, have, no, objection, but, i, do, not, feel, inclined, to, take, any, initiative, for, one, thing, judo, in, reality, is, not, a, mere, sport, or, game, i, regard, it, as, a, principle, of, life, art, and, science, in, fact, it, is, a, means, for, personal, cultural, attainment, only, one, of, the, forms, of, judo, training, so, called, randori, or, free, practice, can, be, classed, as, a, form, of, sport, certainly, to, some, extent, the, same, may, be, said, of, boxing, and, fencing, but, today, they, are, practiced, and, conducted, as, sports, then, the, olympic, games, are, so, strongly, flavored, with, nationalism, that, it, is, possible, to, be, influenced, by, it, and, to, develop, contest, judo, a, retrograde, form, as, ju, jitsu, was, before, the, kodokan, was, founded, judo, should, be, free, as, art, and, science, from, any, external, influences, political, national, racial, and, financial, or, any, other, organized, interest, and, all, things, connected, with, it, should, be, directed, to, its, ultimate, object, the, benefit, of, humanity, human, sacrifice, is, a, matter, of, ancient, history, at, the, 57th, general, session, of, the, international, olympic, committee, held, in, rome, on, 22, august, 1960, the, ioc, members, formally, decided, to, include, judo, among,

opposed, had, nothing, against, judo, itself, but, against, increasing, the, number, of, olympic, events, as, a, whole, there, were, only, two, dissenting, votes, in, the, final, poll, for, the, first, time, in, history, a, traditional, japanese, sport, has, been, included, in, the, olympic, competition, finally, judo, was, first, contested, as, an, olympic, sport, for, men, in, the, 1964,
