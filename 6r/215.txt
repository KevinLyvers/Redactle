cookware, and, bakeware, is, food, preparation, equipment, such, as, cooking, pots, pans, baking, sheets, etc, used, in, kitchens, cookware, is, used, on, a, stove, or, range, cooktop, while, bakeware, is, used, in, an, oven, some, utensils, are, considered, both, cookware, and, bakeware, there, is, a, great, variety, of, cookware, and, bakeware, in, shape, material, and, inside, surface, some, materials, conduct, heat, well, some, retain, heat, well, some, surfaces, are, non, stick, some, require, seasoning, some, pots, and, their, lids, have, handles, or, knobs, made, of, low, thermal, conductance, materials, such, as, bakelite, plastic, or, wood, which, make, them, easy, to, pick, up, without, oven, gloves, a, good, cooking, pot, design, has, an, overcook, edge, which, is, what, the, lid, lies, on, the, lid, has, a, dripping, edge, that, prevents, condensation, fluid, from, dripping, off, when, handling, the, lid, taking, it, off, and, holding, it, 45, or, putting, it, down, the, history, of, cooking, vessels, before, the, development, of, pottery, is, minimal, due, to, the, limited, archaeological, evidence, the, earliest, pottery, vessels, dating, from, 19, 600, 400, bp, were, discovered, in, xianrendong, cave, jiangxi, china, the, pottery, may, have, been, used, as, cookware, manufactured, by, hunter, gatherers, harvard, university, archaeologist, ofer, bar, yosef, reported, that, when, you, look, at, the, pots, you, can, see, that, they, were, in, a, fire, it, is, also, possible, to, extrapolate, likely, developments, based, on, methods, used, by, latter, peoples, among, the, first, of, the, techniques, believed, to, be, used, by, stone, age, civilizations, were, improvements, to, basic, roasting, in, addition, to, exposing, food, to, direct, heat, from, either, an, open, fire, or, hot, embers, it, is, possible, to, cover, the, food, with, clay, or, large, leaves, before, roasting, to, preserve, moisture, in, the, cooked, result, examples, of, similar, techniques, are, still, in, use, in, many, modern, cuisines, of, greater, difficulty, was, finding, a, method, to, boil, water, for, people, without, access, to, natural, heated, water, sources, such, as, hot, springs, heated, stones, pot, boilers, could, be, placed, in, a, water, filled, vessel, to, raise, its, temperature, for, example, a, leaf, lined, pit, or, the, stomach, from, animals, killed, by, hunters, in, many, locations, the, shells, of, turtles, or, large, mollusks, provided, a, source, for, waterproof, cooking, vessels, bamboo, tubes, sealed, at, the, end, with, clay, provided, a, usable, container, in, asia, while, the, inhabitants, of, the, tehuacan, valley, began, carving, large, stone, bowls, that, were, permanently, set, into, a, hearth, as, early, as, 7, 000, bc, according, to, frank, hamilton, cushing, native, american, cooking, baskets, used, by, the, zuni, zu, i, developed, from, mesh, casings, woven, to, stabilize, gourd, water, vessels, he, reported, witnessing, cooking, basket, use, by, havasupai, in, 1881, roasting, baskets, covered, with, clay, would, be, filled, with, wood, coals, and, the, product, to, be, roasted, when, the, thus, fired, clay, separated, from, the, basket, it, would, become, a, usable, clay, roasting, pan, in, itself, this, indicates, a, steady, progression, from, use, of, woven, gourd, casings, to, waterproof, cooking, baskets, to, pottery, other, than, in, many, other, cultures, native, americans, used, and, still, use, the, heat, source, inside, the, cookware, cooking, baskets, are, filled, with, hot, stones, and, roasting, pans, with, wood, coals, native, americans, would, form, a, basket, from, large, leaves, to, boil, water, according, to, historian, and, novelist, louis, l, amour, as, long, as, the, flames, did, not, reach, above, the, level, of, water, in, the, basket, the, leaves, would, not, burn, through, the, development, of, pottery, allowed, for, the, creation, of, fireproof, cooking, vessels, in, a, variety, of, shapes, and, sizes, coating, the, earthenware, with, some, type, of, plant, gum, and, later, glazes, converted, the, porous, container, into, a, waterproof, vessel, the, earthenware, cookware, could, then, be, suspended, over, a, fire, through, use, of, a, tripod, or, other, apparatus, or, even, be, placed, directly, into, a, low, fire, or, coal, bed, as, in, the, case, of, the, pipkin, ceramics, conduct, heat, poorly, however, so, ceramic, pots, must, cook, over, relatively, low, heats, and, over, long, periods, of, time, however, most, ceramic, pots, will, crack, if, used, on, the, stovetop, and, are, only, intended, for, the, oven, the, development, of, bronze, and, iron, metalworking, skills, allowed, for, cookware, made, from, metal, to, be, manufactured, although, adoption, of, the, new, cookware, was, slow, due, to, the, much, higher, cost, after, the, development, of, metal, cookware, there, was, little, new, development, in, cookware, with, the, standard, medieval, kitchen, utilizing, a, cauldron, and, a, shallow, earthenware, pan, for, most, cooking, tasks, with, a, spit, employed, for, roasting, by, the, 17th, century, it, was, common, for, a, western, kitchen, to, contain, a, number, of, skillets, baking, pans, a, kettle, and, several, pots, along, with, a, variety, of, pot, hooks, and, trivets, brass, or, copper, vessels, were, common, in, asia, and, europe, whilst, iron, pots, were, common, in, the, american, colonies, improvements, in, metallurgy, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, allowed, for, pots, and, pans, from, metals, such, as, steel, stainless, steel, and, aluminium, to, be, economically, produced, at, the, 1968, miss, america, protest, protestors, symbolically, threw, a, number, of, feminine, products, into, a, freedom, trash, can, which, included, pots, and, pans, metal, pots, are, made, from, a, narrow, range, of, metals, because, pots, and, pans, need, to, conduct, heat, well, but, also, need, to, be, chemically, unreactive, so, that, they, do, not, alter, the, flavor, of, the, food, most, materials, that, are, conductive, enough, to, heat, evenly, are, too, reactive, to, use, in, food, preparation, in, some, cases, copper, pots, for, example, a, pot, may, be, made, out, of, a, more, reactive, metal, and, then, tinned, or, clad, with, another, while, metal, pots, take, heat, very, well, they, usually, react, poorly, to, rapid, cooling, such, as, being, plunged, into, water, while, hot, this, will, usually, warp, the, piece, over, time, aluminium, is, a, lightweight, metal, with, very, good, thermal, conductivity, it, is, resistant, to, many, forms, of, corrosion, aluminium, is, commonly, available, in, sheet, cast, or, anodized, forms, and, may, be, physically, combined, with, other, metals, see, below, sheet, aluminium, is, spun, or, stamped, into, form, due, to, the, softness, of, the, metal, it, may, be, alloyed, with, magnesium, copper, or, bronze, to, increase, its, strength, sheet, aluminium, is, commonly, used, for, baking, sheets, pie, plates, and, cake, or, muffin, pans, deep, or, shallow, pots, may, be, formed, from, sheet, aluminium, cast, aluminium, can, produce, a, thicker, product, than, sheet, aluminium, and, is, appropriate, for, irregular, shapes, and, thicknesses, due, to, the, microscopic, pores, caused, by, the, casting, process, cast, aluminium, has, a, lower, thermal, conductivity, than, sheet, aluminium, it, is, also, more, expensive, accordingly, cast, aluminium, cookware, has, become, less, common, it, is, used, for, example, to, make, dutch, ovens, lightweight, and, bundt, pans, heavy, duty, and, used, in, ladles, and, handles, and, woks, to, keep, the, sides, at, a, lower, temperature, than, the, center, anodized, aluminium, has, had, the, naturally, occurring, layer, of, aluminium, oxide, thickened, by, an, electrolytic, process, to, create, a, surface, that, is, hard, and, non, reactive, it, is, used, for, saut, pans, stockpots, roasters, and, dutch, ovens, uncoated, and, un, anodized, aluminium, can, react, with, acidic, foods, to, change, the, taste, of, the, food, sauces, containing, egg, yolks, or, vegetables, such, as, asparagus, or, artichokes, may, cause, oxidation, of, non, anodized, aluminium, aluminium, exposure, has, been, suggested, as, a, risk, factor, for, alzheimer, s, disease, the, alzheimer, s, association, states, that, studies, have, failed, to, confirm, any, role, for, aluminum, in, causing, alzheimer, s, the, link, remains, controversial, copper, provides, the, highest, thermal, conductivity, among, non, noble, metals, and, is, therefore, fast, heating, with, unparalleled, heat, distribution, see, copper, in, heat, exchangers, pots, and, pans, are, cold, formed, from, copper, sheets, of, various, thicknesses, with, those, in, excess, of, 2, 5, mm, considered, commercial, or, extra, fort, grade, between, 1, mm, and, 2, 5, mm, wall, thickness, is, considered, utility, fort, grade, with, thicknesses, below, 1, 5, mm, often, requiring, tube, beading, or, edge, rolling, for, reinforcement, less, than, 1mm, wall, thickness, is, generally, considered, decorative, with, exception, made, for, the, case, of, 75, 1, mm, planished, copper, which, is, hardened, by, hammering, and, therefore, expresses, performance, and, strength, characteristic, of, thicker, material, copper, thickness, of, less, than, 25, mm, is, in, the, case, of, cookware, referred, to, as, foil, and, must, be, formed, to, a, more, structurally, rigid, metal, to, produce, a, serviceable, vessel, such, applications, of, copper, are, purely, aesthetic, and, do, not, materially, contribute, to, cookware, performance, copper, is, reactive, with, acidic, foods, which, can, result, in, corrosion, the, byproducts, of, which, can, foment, copper, toxicity, in, certain, circumstances, however, unlined, copper, is, recommended, and, safe, for, instance, in, the, preparation, of, meringue, where, copper, ions, prompt, proteins, to, denature, unfold, and, enable, stronger, protein, bonds, across, the, sulfur, contained, in, egg, whites, unlined, copper, is, also, used, in, the, making, of, preserves, jams, and, jellies, copper, does, not, store, bank, heat, and, so, thermal, flows, reverse, almost, immediately, upon, removal, from, heat, this, allows, precise, control, of, consistency, and, texture, while, cooking, sugar, and, pectin, thickened, preparations, alone, fruit, acid, would, be, sufficient, to, cause, leaching, of, copper, byproducts, but, naturally, occurring, fruit, sugars, and, added, preserving, sugars, buffer, copper, reactivity, unlined, pans, have, thereby, been, used, safely, in, such, applications, for, centuries, lining, copper, pots, and, pans, prevents, copper, from, contact, with, acidic, foods, the, most, popular, lining, types, are, tin, stainless, steel, nickel, and, silver, the, use, of, tin, dates, back, many, centuries, and, is, the, original, lining, for, copper, cookware, although, the, patent, for, canning, in, sheet, tin, was, secured, in, 1810, in, england, legendary, french, chef, auguste, escoffier, experimented, with, a, solution, for, provisioning, the, french, army, while, in, the, field, by, adapting, the, tin, lining, techniques, used, for, his, cookware, to, more, robust, steel, containers, then, only, lately, introduced, for, canning, which, protected, the, cans, from, corrosion, and, soldiers, from, lead, solder, and, botulism, poisoning, tin, linings, sufficiently, robust, for, cooking, are, wiped, onto, copper, by, hand, producing, a, 35, 45, mm, thick, lining, decorative, copper, cookware, i, e, a, pot, or, pan, less, than, 1, mm, thick, and, therefore, unsuited, to, cooking, will, often, be, electroplate, lined, with, tin, should, a, wiped, tin, lining, be, damaged, or, wear, out, the, cookware, can, be, re, tinned, usually, for, much, less, cost, than, the, purchase, price, of, the, pan, tin, presents, a, smooth, crystalline, structure, and, is, therefore, relatively, non, stick, in, cooking, applications, as, a, relatively, soft, metal, abrasive, cleansers, or, cleaning, techniques, can, accelerate, wear, of, tin, linings, wood, silicone, or, plastic, implements, are, to, preferred, over, harder, stainless, steel, types, for, a, period, following, the, second, world, war, copper, cookware, was, electroplated, with, a, nickel, lining, nickel, is, harder, and, more, thermally, efficient, than, tin, with, a, higher, melting, point, despite, its, hardness, it, wore, out, as, fast, as, tin, as, the, plating, was, 20, microns, thick, or, less, as, nickel, tends, to, plate, somewhat, irregularly, and, requires, milling, to, produce, an, even, cooking, surface, nickel, is, also, stickier, than, tin, or, silver, copper, cookware, with, aged, or, damaged, nickel, linings, can, be, retinned, or, possibly, replating, with, nickel, although, this, is, no, longer, widely, available, nickel, linings, began, to, fall, out, of, favor, in, the, 1980s, owing, to, the, isolation, of, nickel, as, an, allergen, silver, is, also, applied, to, copper, by, means, of, electroplating, and, provides, an, interior, finish, that, is, at, once, smooth, more, durable, than, either, tin, or, nickel, relatively, non, stick, and, extremely, thermally, efficient, copper, and, silver, bond, extremely, well, owing, to, their, shared, high, electro, conductivity, lining, thickness, varies, widely, by, maker, but, averages, between, 7, and, 10, microns, the, disadvantages, of, silver, are, expense, and, the, tendency, of, sulfurous, foods, especially, brassicas, to, discolor, worn, silver, linings, on, copper, cookware, can, be, restored, by, stripping, and, re, electroplating, copper, cookware, lined, with, a, thin, layer, of, stainless, steel, is, available, from, most, modern, european, manufacturers, stainless, steel, is, 25, times, less, thermally, conductive, than, copper, and, is, sometimes, critiqued, for, compromising, the, efficacy, of, the, copper, with, which, it, is, bonded, among, the, advantages, of, stainless, steel, are, its, durability, and, corrosion, resistance, and, although, relatively, sticky, and, subject, to, food, residue, adhesions, stainless, steel, is, tolerant, of, most, abrasive, cleaning, techniques, and, metal, implements, stainless, steel, forms, a, pan, s, structural, element, when, bonded, to, copper, and, is, irreparable, in, the, event, of, wear, or, damage, using, modern, metal, bonding, techniques, such, as, cladding, copper, is, frequently, incorporated, into, cookware, constructed, of, primarily, dissimilar, metal, such, as, stainless, steel, often, as, an, enclosed, diffusion, layer, see, coated, and, composite, cookware, below, cast, iron, cookware, is, slow, to, heat, but, once, at, temperature, provides, even, heating, cast, iron, can, also, withstand, very, high, temperatures, making, cast, iron, pans, ideal, for, searing, being, a, reactive, material, cast, iron, can, have, chemical, reactions, with, high, acid, foods, such, as, wine, or, tomatoes, in, addition, some, foods, such, as, spinach, cooked, on, bare, cast, iron, will, turn, black, cast, iron, is, a, somewhat, brittle, porous, material, that, rusts, easily, as, a, result, it, should, not, be, dropped, or, heated, unevenly, and, it, typically, requires, seasoning, before, use, seasoning, creates, a, thin, layer, of, oxidized, fat, over, the, iron, that, coats, and, protects, the, surface, from, corrosion, and, prevents, sticking, enameled, cast, iron, cookware, was, developed, in, the, 1920s, in, 1934, the, french, company, cousances, designed, the, enameled, cast, iron, doufeu, to, reduce, excessive, evaporation, and, scorching, in, cast, iron, dutch, ovens, modeled, on, old, braising, pans, in, which, glowing, charcoal, was, heaped, on, the, lids, to, mimic, two, fire, ovens, the, doufeu, has, a, deep, recess, in, its, lid, which, instead, is, filled, with, ice, cubes, this, keeps, the, lid, at, a, lower, temperature, than, the, pot, bottom, further, little, notches, on, the, inside, of, the, lid, allow, the, moisture, to, collect, and, drop, back, into, the, food, during, the, cooking, although, the, doufeu, literally, gentlefire, can, be, used, in, an, oven, without, the, ice, as, a, casserole, pan, it, is, chiefly, designed, for, stove, top, use, enameled, cast, iron, cookware, unlike, uncoated, cast, iron, is, minimally, reactive, thus, can, be, used, with, acidic, food, stainless, steel, is, an, iron, alloy, containing, a, minimum, of, 11, 5, chromium, blends, containing, 18, chromium, with, either, 8, nickel, called, 18, 8, or, with, 10, nickel, called, 18, 10, are, commonly, used, for, kitchen, cookware, stainless, steel, s, virtues, are, resistance, to, corrosion, non, reactivity, with, either, alkaline, or, acidic, foods, and, resistance, to, scratching, and, denting, stainless, steel, s, drawbacks, for, cooking, use, include, its, relatively, poor, thermal, conductivity, since, the, material, does, not, adequately, spread, the, heat, itself, stainless, steel, cookware, is, generally, made, as, a, cladding, of, stainless, steel, on, both, sides, of, an, aluminum, or, copper, core, to, conduct, the, heat, across, all, sides, thereby, reducing, hot, spots, or, with, a, disk, of, copper, or, aluminum, on, just, the, base, to, conduct, the, heat, across, the, base, with, possible, hot, spots, at, the, sides, typical, 18, 10, stainless, steel, also, has, a, relatively, low, magnetic, permeability, making, it, incompatible, with, induction, cooktops, recent, developments, have, allowed, the, production, of, ferromagnetic, 18, 10, alloys, with, a, higher, permeability, in, so, called, tri, ply, cookware, the, central, aluminum, layer, is, paramagnetic, and, the, interior, 18, 10, layer, may, also, but, the, exterior, layer, at, the, base, must, be, ferromagnetic, to, be, compatible, with, induction, cooktops, stainless, steel, does, not, require, seasoning, to, protect, the, surface, from, rust, but, may, be, seasoned, to, provide, a, non, stick, surface, carbon, steel, cookware, can, be, rolled, or, hammered, into, relatively, thin, sheets, of, dense, material, which, provides, robust, strength, and, improved, heat, distribution, carbon, steel, accommodates, high, dry, heat, for, such, operations, as, dry, searing, carbon, steel, does, not, conduct, heat, efficiently, but, this, may, be, an, advantage, for, larger, vessels, such, as, woks, and, paella, pans, where, one, portion, of, the, pan, is, intentionally, kept, at, a, different, temperature, than, the, rest, like, cast, iron, carbon, steel, must, be, seasoned, before, use, usually, by, rubbing, a, fat, or, oil, on, the, cooking, surface, and, heating, the, cookware, on, the, stovetop, or, in, the, oven, with, proper, use, and, care, seasoning, oils, polymerize, on, carbon, steel, to, form, a, low, tack, surface, well, suited, to, browning, maillard, reactions, and, easy, release, of, fried, foods, carbon, steel, will, easily, rust, if, not, seasoned, and, should, be, stored, seasoned, to, avoid, rusting, carbon, steel, is, traditionally, used, for, cr, pe, and, fry, pans, as, well, as, woks, cladding, is, a, technique, for, fabricating, pans, with, a, layer, of, efficient, heat, conducting, material, such, as, copper, or, aluminum, covered, on, the, cooking, surface, by, a, non, reactive, material, such, as, stainless, steel, and, often, covered, on, the, exterior, aspect, of, the, pan, dual, clad, as, well, some, pans, feature, a, copper, or, aluminum, interface, layer, that, extends, over, the, entire, pan, rather, than, just, a, heat, distributing, disk, on, the, base, generally, the, thicker, the, interface, layer, especially, in, the, base, of, the, pan, the, more, improved, the, heat, distribution, claims, of, thermal, efficiency, improvements, are, however, controversial, owing, in, particular, to, the, limiting, and, heat, banking, effect, of, stainless, steel, on, thermal, flows, aluminum, is, typically, clad, on, both, the, inside, and, the, exterior, pan, surfaces, providing, both, a, stainless, cooking, surface, and, a, stainless, surface, to, contact, the, cooktop, copper, of, various, thicknesses, is, often, clad, on, its, interior, surface, only, leaving, the, more, attractive, copper, exposed, on, the, outside, of, the, pan, see, copper, above, some, cookware, use, a, dual, clad, process, with, a, thin, stainless, layer, on, the, cooking, surface, a, thick, core, of, aluminum, to, provide, structure, and, improved, heat, diffusion, and, a, foil, layer, of, copper, on, the, exterior, to, provide, the, look, of, a, copper, pot, at, a, lower, price, enameled, cast, iron, cooking, vessels, are, made, of, cast, iron, covered, with, a, porcelain, surface, this, creates, a, piece, that, has, the, heat, distribution, and, retention, properties, of, cast, iron, combined, with, a, non, reactive, low, stick, surface, the, enamel, over, steel, technique, creates, a, piece, that, has, the, heat, distribution, of, carbon, steel, and, a, non, reactive, low, stick, surface, such, pots, are, much, lighter, than, most, other, pots, of, similar, size, are, cheaper, to, make, than, stainless, steel, pots, and, do, not, have, the, rust, and, reactivity, issues, of, cast, iron, or, carbon, steel, enamel, over, steel, is, ideal, for, large, stockpots, and, for, other, large, pans, used, mostly, for, water, based, cooking, because, of, its, light, weight, and, easy, cleanup, enamel, over, steel, is, also, popular, for, cookware, used, while, camping, seasoning, is, the, process, of, treating, the, surface, of, a, cooking, vessel, with, a, dry, hard, smooth, hydrophobic, coating, formed, from, polymerized, fat, or, oil, when, seasoned, surfaces, are, used, for, cookery, in, conjunction, with, oil, or, fat, a, stick, resistant, effect, is, produced, some, form, of, post, manufacturing, treatment, or, end, user, seasoning, is, mandatory, on, cast, iron, cookware, which, rusts, rapidly, when, heated, in, the, presence, of, available, oxygen, notably, from, water, even, small, quantities, such, as, drippings, from, dry, meat, food, tends, to, stick, to, unseasoned, iron, and, carbon, steel, cookware, both, of, which, are, seasoned, for, this, reason, as, well, other, cookware, surfaces, such, as, stainless, steel, or, cast, aluminium, do, not, require, as, much, protection, from, corrosion, but, seasoning, is, still, very, often, employed, by, professional, chefs, to, avoid, sticking, seasoning, of, other, cookware, surfaces, is, generally, discouraged, non, stick, enamels, often, crack, under, heat, stress, and, non, stick, polymers, such, as, teflon, degrade, at, high, heat, so, neither, type, of, surface, should, be, seasoned, steel, or, aluminum, cooking, pans, can, be, coated, with, a, substance, such, as, polytetrafluoroethylene, ptfe, often, referred, to, with, the, genericized, trademark, teflon, in, order, to, minimize, food, sticking, to, the, pan, surface, there, are, advantages, and, disadvantages, to, such, a, coating, coated, pans, are, easier, to, clean, than, most, non, coated, pans, and, require, little, or, no, additional, oil, or, fat, to, prevent, sticking, a, property, that, helps, to, produce, lower, fat, food, on, the, other, hand, some, sticking, is, required, to, cause, sucs, to, form, so, a, non, stick, pan, cannot, be, used, where, a, pan, sauce, is, desired, non, stick, coatings, tend, to, degrade, over, time, and, are, susceptible, to, damage, using, metal, implements, harsh, scouring, pads, or, chemical, abrasives, can, damage, or, destroy, cooking, surface, non, stick, pans, must, not, be, overheated, the, coating, is, stable, at, normal, cooking, temperatures, even, at, the, smoke, point, of, most, oils, however, if, a, non, stick, pan, is, heated, while, empty, its, temperature, may, quickly, exceed, 260, c, 500, f, above, which, the, non, stick, coating, may, begin, to, deteriorate, changing, color, and, losing, its, non, stick, properties, non, metallic, cookware, can, be, used, in, both, conventional, and, microwave, ovens, non, metallic, cookware, typically, can, not, be, used, on, the, stovetop, with, the, exception, of, glass, ceramic, cookware, rigid, non, metallic, cookware, tends, to, shatter, on, sudden, cooling, or, uneven, heating, although, low, expansion, materials, such, as, borosilicate, glass, and, glass, ceramics, have, significant, immunity, pottery, has, been, used, to, make, cookware, from, before, dated, history, pots, and, pans, made, with, this, material, are, durable, some, could, last, a, lifetime, or, more, and, are, inert, and, non, reactive, heat, is, also, conducted, evenly, in, this, material, they, can, be, used, for, both, cooking, in, a, fire, pit, surrounded, with, coals, and, for, baking, in, the, oven, glazed, ceramics, such, as, porcelain, provide, a, nonstick, cooking, surface, historically, some, glazes, used, on, ceramic, articles, contained, levels, of, lead, which, can, possess, health, risks, although, this, is, not, a, concern, with, the, vast, majority, of, modern, ware, some, pottery, can, be, placed, on, fire, directly, borosilicate, glass, is, safe, at, oven, temperatures, the, clear, glass, also, allows, for, the, food, to, be, seen, during, the, cooking, process, however, it, cannot, be, used, on, a, stovetop, as, it, cannot, cope, with, stovetop, temperatures, glass, ceramic, is, used, to, make, products, such, as, corningware, and, pyroflam, which, have, many, of, the, best, properties, of, both, glass, and, ceramic, cookware, while, pyrex, can, shatter, if, taken, between, extremes, of, temperature, too, rapidly, glass, ceramics, can, be, taken, directly, from, deep, freeze, to, the, stove, top, their, very, low, coefficient, of, thermal, expansion, makes, them, less, prone, to, thermal, shock, a, natural, stone,
