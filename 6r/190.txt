adoption, is, a, process, whereby, a, person, assumes, the, parenting, of, another, usually, a, child, from, that, person, s, biological, or, legal, parent, or, parents, legal, adoptions, permanently, transfer, all, rights, and, responsibilities, along, with, filiation, from, the, biological, parents, to, the, adoptive, parents, unlike, guardianship, or, other, systems, designed, for, the, care, of, the, young, adoption, is, intended, to, effect, a, permanent, change, in, status, and, as, such, requires, societal, recognition, either, through, legal, or, religious, sanction, historically, some, societies, have, enacted, specific, laws, governing, adoption, while, others, used, less, formal, means, notably, contracts, that, specified, inheritance, rights, and, parental, responsibilities, without, an, accompanying, transfer, of, filiation, modern, systems, of, adoption, arising, in, the, 20th, century, tend, to, be, governed, by, comprehensive, statutes, and, regulations, while, the, modern, form, of, adoption, emerged, in, the, united, states, forms, of, the, practice, appeared, throughout, history, the, code, of, hammurabi, for, example, details, the, rights, of, adopters, and, the, responsibilities, of, adopted, individuals, at, length, the, practice, of, adoption, in, ancient, rome, is, well, documented, in, the, codex, justinianus, markedly, different, from, the, modern, period, ancient, adoption, practices, put, emphasis, on, the, political, and, economic, interests, of, the, adopter, providing, a, legal, tool, that, strengthened, political, ties, between, wealthy, families, and, created, male, heirs, to, manage, estates, the, use, of, adoption, by, the, aristocracy, is, well, documented, many, of, rome, s, emperors, were, adopted, sons, adrogation, was, a, kind, of, roman, adoption, in, which, the, person, adopted, consented, to, be, adopted, by, another, infant, adoption, during, antiquity, appears, rare, abandoned, children, were, often, picked, up, for, slavery, and, composed, a, significant, percentage, of, the, empire, s, slave, supply, roman, legal, records, indicate, that, foundlings, were, occasionally, taken, in, by, families, and, raised, as, a, son, or, daughter, although, not, normally, adopted, under, roman, law, the, children, called, alumni, were, reared, in, an, arrangement, similar, to, guardianship, being, considered, the, property, of, the, father, who, abandoned, them, other, ancient, civilizations, notably, india, and, china, used, some, form, of, adoption, as, well, evidence, suggests, the, goal, of, this, practice, was, to, ensure, the, continuity, of, cultural, and, religious, practices, in, contrast, to, the, western, idea, of, extending, family, lines, in, ancient, india, adoption, was, conducted, in, a, limited, and, highly, ritualistic, form, so, that, an, adopter, might, have, the, necessary, funerary, rites, performed, by, a, son, china, had, a, similar, idea, of, adoption, with, males, adopted, solely, to, perform, the, duties, of, ancestor, worship, the, practice, of, adopting, the, children, of, family, members, and, close, friends, was, common, among, the, cultures, of, polynesia, including, hawaii, where, the, custom, was, referred, to, as, h, nai, the, nobility, of, the, germanic, celtic, and, slavic, cultures, that, dominated, europe, after, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, denounced, the, practice, of, adoption, in, medieval, society, bloodlines, were, paramount, a, ruling, dynasty, lacking, a, natural, born, heir, apparent, was, replaced, a, stark, contrast, to, roman, traditions, the, evolution, of, european, law, reflects, this, aversion, to, adoption, english, common, law, for, instance, did, not, permit, adoption, since, it, contradicted, the, customary, rules, of, inheritance, in, the, same, vein, france, s, napoleonic, code, made, adoption, difficult, requiring, adopters, to, be, over, the, age, of, 50, sterile, older, than, the, adopted, person, by, at, least, 15, years, and, to, have, fostered, the, adoptee, for, at, least, six, years, some, adoptions, continued, to, occur, however, but, became, informal, based, on, ad, hoc, contracts, for, example, in, the, year, 737, in, a, charter, from, the, town, of, lucca, three, adoptees, were, made, heirs, to, an, estate, like, other, contemporary, arrangements, the, agreement, stressed, the, responsibility, of, the, adopted, rather, than, adopter, focusing, on, the, fact, that, under, the, contract, the, adoptive, father, was, meant, to, be, cared, for, in, his, old, age, an, idea, that, is, similar, to, the, conceptions, of, adoption, under, roman, law, europe, s, cultural, makeover, marked, a, period, of, significant, innovation, for, adoption, without, support, from, the, nobility, the, practice, gradually, shifted, toward, abandoned, children, abandonment, levels, rose, with, the, fall, of, the, empire, and, many, of, the, foundlings, were, left, on, the, doorstep, of, the, church, initially, the, clergy, reacted, by, drafting, rules, to, govern, the, exposing, selling, and, rearing, of, abandoned, children, the, church, s, innovation, however, was, the, practice, of, oblation, whereby, children, were, dedicated, to, lay, life, within, monastic, institutions, and, reared, within, a, monastery, this, created, the, first, system, in, european, history, in, which, abandoned, children, did, not, have, legal, social, or, moral, disadvantages, as, a, result, many, of, europe, s, abandoned, and, orphaned, children, became, alumni, of, the, church, which, in, turn, took, the, role, of, adopter, oblation, marks, the, beginning, of, a, shift, toward, institutionalization, eventually, bringing, about, the, establishment, of, the, foundling, hospital, and, orphanage, as, the, idea, of, institutional, care, gained, acceptance, formal, rules, appeared, about, how, to, place, children, into, families, boys, could, become, apprenticed, to, an, artisan, and, girls, might, be, married, off, under, the, institution, s, authority, institutions, informally, adopted, out, children, as, well, a, mechanism, treated, as, a, way, to, obtain, cheap, labor, demonstrated, by, the, fact, that, when, the, adopted, died, their, bodies, were, returned, by, the, family, to, the, institution, for, burial, this, system, of, apprenticeship, and, informal, adoption, extended, into, the, 19th, century, today, seen, as, a, transitional, phase, for, adoption, history, under, the, direction, of, social, welfare, activists, orphan, asylums, began, to, promote, adoptions, based, on, sentiment, rather, than, work, children, were, placed, out, under, agreements, to, provide, care, for, them, as, family, members, instead, of, under, contracts, for, apprenticeship, the, growth, of, this, model, is, believed, to, have, contributed, to, the, enactment, of, the, first, modern, adoption, law, in, 1851, by, the, commonwealth, of, massachusetts, unique, in, that, it, codified, the, ideal, of, the, best, interests, of, the, child, despite, its, intent, though, in, practice, the, system, operated, much, the, same, as, earlier, incarnations, the, experience, of, the, boston, female, asylum, bfa, is, a, good, example, which, had, up, to, 30, of, its, charges, adopted, out, by, 1888, officials, of, the, bfa, noted, that, although, the, asylum, promoted, otherwise, adoptive, parents, did, not, distinguish, between, indenture, and, adoption, we, believe, the, asylum, officials, said, that, often, when, children, of, a, younger, age, are, taken, to, be, adopted, the, adoption, is, only, another, name, for, service, the, next, stage, of, adoption, s, evolution, fell, to, the, emerging, nation, of, the, united, states, rapid, immigration, and, the, american, civil, war, resulted, in, unprecedented, overcrowding, of, orphanages, and, foundling, homes, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, charles, loring, brace, a, protestant, minister, became, appalled, by, the, legions, of, homeless, waifs, roaming, the, streets, of, new, york, city, brace, considered, the, abandoned, youth, particularly, catholics, to, be, the, most, dangerous, element, challenging, the, city, s, order, his, solution, was, outlined, in, the, best, method, of, disposing, of, our, pauper, and, vagrant, children, 1859, which, started, the, orphan, train, movement, the, orphan, trains, eventually, shipped, an, estimated, 200, 000, children, from, the, urban, centers, of, the, east, to, the, nation, s, rural, regions, the, children, were, generally, indentured, rather, than, adopted, to, families, who, took, them, in, as, in, times, past, some, children, were, raised, as, members, of, the, family, while, others, were, used, as, farm, laborers, and, household, servants, the, sheer, size, of, the, displacement, the, largest, migration, of, children, in, history, and, the, degree, of, exploitation, that, occurred, gave, rise, to, new, agencies, and, a, series, of, laws, that, promoted, adoption, arrangements, rather, than, indenture, the, hallmark, of, the, period, is, minnesota, s, adoption, law, of, 1917, which, mandated, investigation, of, all, placements, and, limited, record, access, to, those, involved, in, the, adoption, during, the, same, period, the, progressive, movement, swept, the, united, states, with, a, critical, goal, of, ending, the, prevailing, orphanage, system, the, culmination, of, such, efforts, came, with, the, first, white, house, conference, on, the, care, of, dependent, children, called, by, president, theodore, roosevelt, in, 1909, where, it, was, declared, that, the, nuclear, family, represented, the, highest, and, finest, product, of, civilization, and, was, best, able, to, serve, as, primary, caretaker, for, the, abandoned, and, orphaned, as, late, as, 1923, only, two, percent, of, children, without, parental, care, were, in, adoptive, homes, with, the, balance, in, foster, arrangements, and, orphanages, less, than, forty, years, later, nearly, one, third, were, in, adoptive, homes, nevertheless, the, popularity, of, eugenic, ideas, in, america, put, up, obstacles, to, the, growth, of, adoption, there, were, grave, concerns, about, the, genetic, quality, of, illegitimate, and, indigent, children, perhaps, best, exemplified, by, the, influential, writings, of, henry, h, goddard, who, protested, against, adopting, children, of, unknown, origin, saying, now, it, happens, that, some, people, are, interested, in, the, welfare, and, high, development, of, the, human, race, but, leaving, aside, those, exceptional, people, all, fathers, and, mothers, are, interested, in, the, welfare, of, their, own, families, the, dearest, thing, to, the, parental, heart, is, to, have, the, children, marry, well, and, rear, a, noble, family, how, short, sighted, it, is, then, for, such, a, family, to, take, into, its, midst, a, child, whose, pedigree, is, absolutely, unknown, or, where, if, it, were, partially, known, the, probabilities, are, strong, that, it, would, show, poor, and, diseased, stock, and, that, if, a, marriage, should, take, place, between, that, individual, and, any, member, of, the, family, the, offspring, would, be, degenerates, the, period, 1945, to, 1974, the, baby, scoop, era, saw, rapid, growth, and, acceptance, of, adoption, as, a, means, to, build, a, family, illegitimate, births, rose, three, fold, after, world, war, ii, as, sexual, mores, changed, simultaneously, the, scientific, community, began, to, stress, the, dominance, of, nurture, over, genetics, chipping, away, at, eugenic, stigmas, in, this, environment, adoption, became, the, obvious, solution, for, both, unwed, people, and, infertile, couples, taken, together, these, trends, resulted, in, a, new, american, model, for, adoption, following, its, roman, predecessor, americans, severed, the, rights, of, the, original, parents, while, making, adopters, the, new, parents, in, the, eyes, of, the, law, two, innovations, were, added, 1, adoption, was, meant, to, ensure, the, best, interests, of, the, child, the, seeds, of, this, idea, can, be, traced, to, the, first, american, adoption, law, in, massachusetts, and, 2, adoption, became, infused, with, secrecy, eventually, resulting, in, the, sealing, of, adoption, and, original, birth, records, by, 1945, the, origin, of, the, move, toward, secrecy, began, with, charles, loring, brace, who, introduced, it, to, prevent, children, from, the, orphan, trains, from, returning, to, or, being, reclaimed, by, their, parents, brace, feared, the, impact, of, the, parents, poverty, in, general, and, catholic, religion, in, particular, on, the, youth, this, tradition, of, secrecy, was, carried, on, by, the, later, progressive, reformers, when, drafting, of, american, laws, the, number, of, adoptions, in, the, united, states, peaked, in, 1970, it, is, uncertain, what, caused, the, subsequent, decline, likely, contributing, factors, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, include, a, decline, in, the, fertility, rate, associated, with, the, introduction, of, the, pill, the, completion, of, legalization, of, artificial, birth, control, methods, the, introduction, of, federal, funding, to, make, family, planning, services, available, to, the, young, and, low, income, and, the, legalization, of, abortion, in, addition, the, years, of, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, saw, a, dramatic, change, in, society, s, view, of, illegitimacy, and, in, the, legal, rights, of, those, born, outside, of, wedlock, in, response, family, preservation, efforts, grew, so, that, few, children, born, out, of, wedlock, today, are, adopted, ironically, adoption, is, far, more, visible, and, discussed, in, society, today, yet, it, is, less, common, the, american, model, of, adoption, eventually, proliferated, globally, england, and, wales, established, their, first, formal, adoption, law, in, 1926, the, netherlands, passed, its, law, in, 1956, sweden, made, adoptees, full, members, of, the, family, in, 1959, west, germany, enacted, its, first, laws, in, 1977, additionally, the, asian, powers, opened, their, orphanage, systems, to, adoption, influenced, as, they, were, by, western, ideas, following, colonial, rule, and, military, occupation, in, france, local, public, institutions, accredit, candidates, for, adoption, who, can, then, contact, orphanages, abroad, or, ask, for, the, support, of, ngos, the, system, does, not, involve, fees, but, gives, considerable, power, to, social, workers, whose, decisions, may, restrict, adoption, to, standard, families, middle, age, medium, to, high, income, heterosexual, caucasian, adoption, is, today, practiced, globally, the, table, below, provides, a, snapshot, of, western, adoption, rates, adoption, in, the, united, states, still, occurs, at, rates, nearly, three, times, those, of, its, peers, even, though, the, number, of, children, awaiting, adoption, has, held, steady, in, recent, years, between, 100, 000, and, 125, 000, during, the, period, 2009, to, 2018, contemporary, adoption, practices, can, be, open, or, closed, adoptions, can, occur, between, related, or, unrelated, individuals, historically, most, adoptions, occurred, within, a, family, the, most, recent, data, from, the, u, s, indicates, that, about, half, of, adoptions, are, currently, between, related, individuals, a, common, example, of, this, is, a, step, parent, adoption, where, the, new, partner, of, a, parent, legally, adopts, a, child, from, the, parent, s, previous, relationship, intra, family, adoption, can, also, occur, through, surrender, as, a, result, of, parental, death, or, when, the, child, cannot, otherwise, be, cared, for, and, a, family, member, agrees, to, take, over, adoption, is, not, always, a, voluntary, process, in, some, countries, for, example, in, the, u, k, one, of, the, main, origins, of, children, being, placed, for, adoption, is, that, they, have, been, removed, from, the, birth, home, often, by, a, government, body, such, as, the, local, authority, there, are, a, number, of, reasons, why, children, are, removed, including, abuse, and, neglect, which, can, have, a, lasting, impact, on, the, adoptee, social, workers, in, many, cases, will, be, notified, of, a, safeguarding, concern, in, relation, to, a, child, and, will, make, enquiries, into, the, child, s, well, being, social, workers, will, often, seek, means, of, keeping, a, child, together, with, the, birth, family, for, example, by, providing, additional, support, to, the, family, before, considering, removal, of, a, child, a, court, of, law, will, often, then, make, decisions, regarding, the, child, s, future, for, example, whether, they, can, return, to, the, birth, family, enter, into, foster, care, or, be, adopted, infertility, is, the, main, reason, parents, seek, to, adopt, children, they, are, not, related, to, one, study, shows, this, accounted, for, 80, of, unrelated, infant, adoptions, and, half, of, adoptions, through, foster, care, estimates, suggest, that, 11, 24, of, americans, who, cannot, conceive, or, carry, to, term, attempt, to, build, a, family, through, adoption, and, that, the, overall, rate, of, never, married, american, women, who, adopt, is, about, 1, 4, other, reasons, people, adopt, are, numerous, although, not, well, documented, these, may, include, wanting, to, cement, a, new, family, following, divorce, or, death, of, one, parent, compassion, motivated, by, religious, or, philosophical, conviction, to, avoid, contributing, to, overpopulation, out, of, the, belief, that, it, is, more, responsible, to, care, for, otherwise, parent, less, children, than, to, reproduce, to, ensure, that, inheritable, diseases, e, g, tay, sachs, disease, are, not, passed, on, and, health, concerns, relating, to, pregnancy, and, childbirth, although, there, are, a, range, of, reasons, the, most, recent, study, of, experiences, of, women, who, adopt, suggests, they, are, most, likely, to, be, 40, 44, years, of, age, to, be, currently, married, to, have, impaired, fertility, and, to, be, childless, unrelated, adoptions, may, occur, through, the, following, mechanisms, although, adoption, is, often, described, as, forming, a, forever, family, the, relationship, can, be, ended, at, any, time, the, legal, termination, of, an, adoption, is, called, disruption, in, u, s, terminology, adoptions, are, disrupted, if, they, are, ended, before, being, finalized, and, they, are, dissolved, if, the, relationship, is, ended, afterwards, it, may, also, be, called, a, failed, adoption, after, legal, finalization, the, disruption, process, is, usually, initiated, by, adoptive, parents, via, a, court, petition, and, is, analogous, to, divorce, proceedings, it, is, a, legal, avenue, unique, to, adoptive, parents, as, disruption, dissolution, does, not, apply, to, biological, kin, although, biological, family, members, are, sometimes, disowned, or, abandoned, ad, hoc, studies, performed, in, the, u, s, however, suggest, that, between, 10, and, 25, percent, of, adoptions, through, the, child, welfare, system, e, g, excluding, babies, adopted, from, other, countries, or, step, parents, adopting, their, stepchildren, disrupt, before, they, are, legally, finalized, and, from, 1, to, 10, percent, are, dissolved, after, legal, finalization, the, wide, range, of, values, reflects, the, paucity, of, information, on, the, subject, and, demographic, factors, such, as, age, it, is, known, that, teenagers, are, more, prone, to, having, their, adoptions, disrupted, than, young, children, joint, adoption, by, same, sex, couples, is, legal, in, 34, countries, as, of, march, 2022, and, additionally, in, various, sub, national, territories, adoption, may, also, be, in, the, form, of, step, child, adoption, 6, additional, countries, wherein, one, partner, in, a, same, sex, couple, adopts, the, child, of, the, other, most, countries, that, have, same, sex, marriage, allow, joint, adoption, by, those, couples, the, exceptions, being, ecuador, no, adoption, by, same, sex, couples, taiwan, step, child, adoption, only, and, mexico, in, one, third, of, states, with, same, sex, marriage, a, few, countries, with, civil, unions, or, lesser, marriage, rights, nonetheless, allow, step, or, joint, adoption, in, 2019, the, acs, enhanced, its, approach, to, measuring, same, sex, couple, households, explicitly, distinguishing, between, same, sex, and, opposite, sex, spouses, or, partners, same, sex, parents, according, to, the, acs, were, predominantly, female, notably, 22, 5, of, female, same, sex, couple, households, had, children, under, 18, in, contrast, to, 6, 6, of, male, same, sex, couple, households, in, homes, with, children, neither, male, nor, female, same, sex, couples, were, more, likely, to, have, biological, children, but, male, same, sex, couples, were, more, likely, to, adopt, children, and, less, likely, to, have, stepchildren, the, biological, relationship, between, a, parent, and, child, is, important, and, the, separation, of, the, two, has, led, to, concerns, about, adoption, the, traditional, view, of, adoptive, parenting, received, empirical, support, from, a, princeton, university, study, of, 6, 000, adoptive, step, and, foster, families, in, the, united, states, and, south, africa, from, 1968, to, 1985, the, study, indicated, that, food, expenditures, in, households, with, mothers, of, non, biological, children, when, controlled, for, income, household, size, hours, worked, age, etc, were, significantly, less, for, adoptees, step, children, and, foster, children, causing, the, researchers, to, speculate, that, people, are, less, interested, in, sustaining, the, genetic, lines, of, others, this, theory, is, supported, in, another, more, qualitative, study, wherein, adoptive, relationships, marked, by, sameness, in, likes, personality, and, appearance, were, associated, with, both, adult, adoptees, and, adoptive, parents, reporting, being, happier, with, the, adoption, other, studies, provide, evidence, that, adoptive, relationships, can, form, along, other, lines, a, study, evaluating, the, level, of, parental, investment, indicates, strength, in, adoptive, families, suggesting, that, parents, who, adopt, invest, more, time, in, their, children, than, other, parents, and, concludes, adoptive, parents, enrich, their, children, s, lives, to, compensate, for, the, lack, of, biological, ties, and, the, extra, challenges, of, adoption, another, recent, study, found, that, adoptive, families, invested, more, heavily, in, their, adopted, children, for, example, by, providing, further, education, and, financial, support, noting, that, adoptees, seemed, to, be, more, likely, to, experience, problems, such, as, drug, addiction, the, study, speculated, that, adoptive, parents, might, invest, more, in, adoptees, not, because, they, favor, them, but, because, they, are, more, likely, than, genetic, children, to, need, the, help, psychologists, findings, regarding, the, importance, of, early, mother, infant, bonding, created, some, concern, about, whether, parents, who, adopt, older, infants, or, toddlers, after, birth, have, missed, some, crucial, period, for, the, child, s, development, however, research, on, the, mental, and, social, life, of, babies, suggested, that, the, parent, infant, system, rather, than, a, bond, between, biologically, related, individuals, is, an, evolved, fit, between, innate, behavior, patterns, of, all, human, infants, and, equally, evolved, responses, of, human, adults, to, those, infant, behaviors, thus, nature, ensures, some, initial, flexibility, with, respect, to, the, particular, adults, who, take, on, the, parental, role, beyond, the, foundational, issues, the, unique, questions, posed, for, adoptive, parents, are, varied, they, include, how, to, respond, to, stereotypes, answering, questions, about, heritage, and, how, best, to, maintain, connections, with, biological, kin, when, in, an, open, adoption, one, author, suggests, a, common, question, adoptive, parents, have, is, will, we, love, the, child, even, though, he, she, is, not, our, biological, child, a, specific, concern, for, many, parents, is, accommodating, an, adoptee, in, the, classroom, familiar, lessons, like, draw, your, family, tree, or, trace, your, eye, color, back, through, your, parents, and, grandparents, to, see, where, your, genes, come, from, could, be, hurtful, to, children, who, were, adopted, and, do, not, know, this, biological, information, numerous, suggestions, have, been, made, to, substitute, new, lessons, e, g, focusing, on, family, orchards, adopting, older, children, presents, other, parenting, issues, some, children, from, foster, care, have, histories, of, maltreatment, such, as, physical, and, psychological, neglect, physical, abuse, and, sexual, abuse, and, are, at, risk, of, developing, psychiatric, problems, such, children, are, at, risk, of, developing, a, disorganized, attachment, studies, by, cicchetti, et, al, 1990, 1995, found, that, 80, of, abused, and, maltreated, infants, in, their, sample, exhibited, disorganized, attachment, styles, disorganized, attachment, is, associated, with, a, number, of, developmental, problems, including, dissociative, symptoms, as, well, as, depressive, anxious, and, acting, out, symptoms, attachment, is, an, active, process, it, can, be, secure, or, insecure, maladaptive, or, productive, in, the, u, k, some, adoptions, fail, because, the, adoptive, parents, do, not, get, sufficient, support, to, deal, with, difficult, traumatized, children, this, is, a, false, economy, as, local, authority, care, for, these, children, is, extremely, expensive, concerning, developmental, milestones, studies, from, the, colorado, adoption, project, examined, genetic, influences, on, adoptee, maturation, concluding, that, cognitive, abilities, of, adoptees, reflect, those, of, their, adoptive, parents, in, early, childhood, but, show, little, similarity, by, adolescence, resembling, instead, those, of, their, biological, parents, and, to, the, same, extent, as, peers, in, non, adoptive, families, similar, mechanisms, appear, to, be, at, work, in, the, physical, development, of, adoptees, danish, and, american, researchers, conducting, studies, on, the, genetic, contribution, to, body, mass, index, found, correlations, between, an, adoptee, s, weight, class, and, his, biological, parents, bmi, while, finding, no, relationship, with, the, adoptive, family, environment, moreover, about, one, half, of, inter, individual, differences, were, due, to, individual, non, shared, influences, these, differences, in, development, appear, to, play, out, in, the, way, young, adoptees, deal, with, major, life, events, in, the, case, of, parental, divorce, adoptees, have, been, found, to, respond, differently, from, children, who, have, not, been, adopted, while, the, general, population, experienced, more, behavioral, problems, substance, use, lower, school, achievement, and, impaired, social, competence, after, parental, divorce, the, adoptee, population, appeared, to, be, unaffected, in, terms, of, their, outside, relationships, specifically, in, their, school, or, social, abilities, recent, research, has, shown, that, adoptive, parenting, may, have, impacts, on, adoptive, children, it, has, been, shown, that, warm, adoptive, parenting, reduces, internalizing, and, externalizing, problems, of, the, adoptive, children, over, time, another, study, shows, that, warm, adoptive, parenting, at, 27, months, predicted, lower, levels, of, child, externalizing, problems, at, ages, 6, and, 7, several, factors, affect, the, decision, to, release, or, raise, the, child, white, adolescents, tend, to, give, up, their, babies, to, non, relatives, whereas, black, adolescents, are, more, likely, to, receive, support, from, their, own, community, in, raising, the, child, and, also, in, the, form, of, informal, adoption, by, relatives, studies, by, leynes, and, by, festinger, and, young, berkman, and, rehr, found, that, for, pregnant, adolescents, the, decision, to, release, the, child, for, adoption, depended, on, the, attitude, toward, adoption, held, by, the, adolescent, s, mother, another, study, found, that, pregnant, adolescents, whose, mothers, had, a, higher, level, of, education, were, more, likely, to, release, their, babies, for, adoption, research, suggests, that, women, who, choose, to, release, their, babies, for, adoption, are, more, likely, to, be, younger, enrolled, in, school, and, have, lived, in, a, two, parent, household, at, age, 10, than, those, who, kept, and, raised, their, babies, there, is, limited, research, on, the, consequences, of, adoption, for, the, original, parents, and, the, findings, have, been, mixed, one, study, found, that, those, who, released, their, babies, for, adoption, were, less, comfortable, with, their, decision, than, those, who, kept, their, babies, however, levels, of, comfort, over, both, groups, were, high, and, those, who, released, their, child, were, similar, to, those, who, kept, their, child, in, ratings, of, life, satisfaction, relationship, satisfaction, and, positive, future, outlook, for, schooling, employment, finances, and, marriage, subsequent, research, found, that, adolescent, mothers, who, chose, to, release, their, babies, for, adoption, were, more, likely, to, experience, feelings, of, sorrow, and, regret, over, their, decision, than, those, who, kept, their, babies, however, these, feelings, decreased, significantly, from, one, year, after, birth, to, the, end, of, the, second, year, more, recent, research, found, that, in, a, sample, of, mothers, who, had, released, their, children, for, adoption, four, to, 12, years, prior, every, participant, had, frequent, thoughts, of, their, lost, child, for, most, thoughts, were, both, negative, and, positive, in, that, they, produced, both, feelings, of, sadness, and, joy, those, who, experienced, the, greatest, portion, of, positive, thoughts, were, those, who, had, open, rather, than, closed, or, time, limited, mediated, adoptions, in, another, study, that, compared, mothers, who, released, their, children, to, those, who, raised, them, mothers, who, released, their, children, were, more, likely, to, delay, their, next, pregnancy, to, delay, marriage, and, to, complete, job, training, however, both, groups, reached, lower, levels, of, education, than, their, peers, who, were, never, pregnant, another, study, found, similar, consequences, for, choosing, to, release, a, child, for, adoption, adolescent, mothers, who, released, their, children, were, more, likely, to, reach, a, higher, level, of, education, and, to, be, employed, than, those, who, kept, their, children, they, also, waited, longer, before, having, their, next, child, most, of, the, research, that, exists, on, adoption, effects, on, the, birth, parents, was, conducted, with, samples, of, adolescents, or, with, women, who, were, adolescents, when, carrying, their, babies, little, data, exists, for, birth, parents, from, other, populations, furthermore, there, is, a, lack, of, longitudinal, data, that, may, elucidate, long, term, social, and, psychological, consequences, for, birth, parents, who, choose, to, place, their, children, for, adoption, previous, research, on, adoption, has, led, to, assumptions, that, indicate, that, there, is, a, heightened, risk, in, terms, of, psychological, development, and, social, relationships, for, adoptees, yet, such, assumptions, have, been, clarified, as, flawed, due, to, methodological, failures, but, more, recent, studies, have, been, supportive, in, indicating, more, accurate, information, and, results, about, the, similarities, differences, and, overall, lifestyles, of, adoptees, adoptees, are, four, times, more, likely, to, attempt, suicide, than, other, people, evidence, about, the, development, of, adoptees, can, be, supported, in, newer, studies, it, can, be, said, that, adoptees, in, some, respect, tend, to, develop, differently, from, the, general, population, this, can, be, seen, in, many, aspects, of, life, but, usually, can, be, found, as, a, greater, risk, around, the, time, of, adolescence, for, example, it, has, been, found, that, many, adoptees, experience, difficulty, in, establishing, a, sense, of, identity, there, are, many, ways, in, which, the, concept, of, identity, can, be, defined, it, is, true, in, all, cases, that, identity, construction, is, an, ongoing, process, of, development, change, and, maintenance, of, identifying, with, the, self, research, has, shown, that, adolescence, is, a, time, of, identity, progression, rather, than, regression, one, s, identity, tends, to, lack, stability, in, the, beginning, years, of, life, but, gains, a, more, stable, sense, in, later, periods, of, childhood, and, adolescence, typically, associated, with, a, time, of, experimentation, there, are, endless, factors, that, go, into, the, construction, of, one, s, identity, as, well, as, being, many, factors, there, are, many, types, of, identities, one, can, associate, with, some, categories, of, identity, include, gender, sexuality, class, racial, and, religious, etc, for, transracial, and, international, adoptees, tension, is, generally, found, in, the, categories, of, racial, ethnic, and, national, identification, because, of, this, the, strength, and, functionality, of, family, relationships, play, a, huge, role, in, its, development, and, outcome, of, identity, construction, transracial, and, transnational, adoptees, tend, to, develop, feelings, of, a, lack, of, acceptance, because, of, such, racial, ethnic, and, cultural, differences, therefore, exposing, transracial, and, transnational, adoptees, to, their, cultures, of, origin, is, important, in, order, to, better, develop, a, sense, of, identity, and, appreciation, for, cultural, diversity, identity, construction, and, reconstruction, for, transnational, adoptees, the, instant, they, are, adopted, for, example, based, upon, specific, laws, and, regulations, of, the, united, states, the, child, citizen, act, of, 2000, makes, sure, to, grant, immediate, u, s, citizenship, to, adoptees, identity, is, defined, both, by, what, one, is, and, what, one, is, not, adoptees, born, into, one, family, lose, an, identity, and, then, borrow, one, from, the, adopting, family, the, formation, of, identity, is, a, complicated, process, and, there, are, many, factors, that, affect, its, outcome, from, a, perspective, of, looking, at, issues, in, adoption, circumstances, the, people, involved, and, affected, by, adoption, the, biological, parent, the, adoptive, parent, and, the, adoptee, can, be, known, as, the, triad, members, and, state, adoption, may, threaten, triad, members, sense, of, identity, triad, members, often, express, feelings, related, to, confused, identity, and, identity, crises, because, of, differences, between, the, triad, relationships, adoption, for, some, precludes, a, complete, or, integrated, sense, of, self, triad, members, may, experience, themselves, as, incomplete, deficient, or, unfinished, they, state, that, they, lack, feelings, of, well, being, integration, or, solidity, associated, with, a, fully, developed, identity, family, plays, a, vital, role, in, identity, formation, this, is, not, only, true, in, childhood, but, also, in, adolescence, identity, gender, sexual, ethnic, religious, family, is, still, forming, during, adolescence, and, family, holds, a, vital, key, to, this, the, research, seems, to, be, unanimous, a, stable, secure, loving, honest, and, supportive, family, in, which, all, members, feel, safe, to, explore, their, identity, is, necessary, for, the, formation, of, a, sound, identity, transracial, and, international, adoptions, are, some, factors, that, play, a, significant, role, in, the, identity, construction, of, adoptees, many, tensions, arise, from, relationships, built, between, the, adoptee, s, and, their, family, these, include, being, different, from, the, parent, s, developing, a, positive, racial, identity, and, dealing, with, racial, ethnic, discrimination, it, has, been, found, that, multicultural, and, transnational, youth, tend, to, identify, with, their, parents, origin, of, culture, and, ethnicity, rather, than, their, residing, location, yet, it, is, sometimes, hard, to, balance, an, identity, between, the, two, because, school, environments, tend, to, lack, diversity, and, acknowledgment, regarding, such, topics, these, tensions, also, tend, to, create, questions, for, the, adoptee, as, well, as, the, family, to, contemplate, some, common, questions, include, what, will, happen, if, the, family, is, more, na, ve, to, the, ways, of, socially, constructed, life, will, tensions, arise, if, this, is, the, case, what, if, the, very, people, that, are, supposed, to, be, modeling, a, sound, identity, are, in, fact, riddled, with, insecurities, ginni, snodgrass, answers, these, questions, in, the, following, way, the, secrecy, in, an, adoptive, family, and, the, denial, that, the, adoptive, family, is, different, builds, dysfunction, into, it, social, workers, and, insecure, adoptive, parents, have, structured, a, family, relationship, that, is, based, on, dishonesty, evasions, and, exploitation, to, believe, that, good, relationships, will, develop, on, such, a, foundation, is, psychologically, unsound, lawrence, secrecy, erects, barriers, to, forming, a, healthy, identity, the, research, says, that, the, dysfunction, untruths, and, evasiveness, that, can, be, present, in, adoptive, families, not, only, makes, identity, formation, impossible, but, also, directly, works, against, it, what, effect, on, identity, formation, is, present, if, the, adoptee, knows, they, are, adopted, but, has, no, information, about, their, biological, parents, silverstein, and, kaplan, s, research, states, that, adoptees, lacking, medical, genetic, religious, and, historical, information, are, plagued, by, questions, such, as, who, am, i, why, was, i, born, what, is, my, purpose, this, lack, of, identity, may, lead, adoptees, particularly, in, adolescent, years, to, seek, out, ways, to, belong, in, a, more, extreme, fashion, than, many, of, their, non, adopted, peers, adolescent, adoptees, are, overrepresented, among, those, who, join, sub, cultures, run, away, become, pregnant, or, totally, reject, their, families, concerning, developmental, milestones, studies, from, the, colorado, adoption, project, examined, genetic, influences, on, adoptee, maturation, concluding, that, cognitive, abilities, of, adoptees, reflect, those, of, their, adoptive, parents, in, early, childhood, but, show, little, similarity, by, adolescence, resembling, instead, those, of, their, biological, parents, and, to, the, same, extent, as, peers, in, non, adoptive, families, similar, mechanisms, appear, to, be, at, work, in, the, physical, development, of, adoptees, danish, and, american, researchers, conducting, studies, on, the, genetic, contribution, to, body, mass, index, found, correlations, between, an, adoptee, s, weight, class, and, his, biological, parents, bmi, while, finding, no, relationship, with, the, adoptive, family, environment, moreover, about, one, half, of, inter, individual, differences, were, due, to, individual, non, shared, influences, these, differences, in, development, appear, to, play, out, in, the, way, young, adoptees, deal, with, major, life, events, in, the, case, of, parental, divorce, adoptees, have, been, found, to, respond, differently, from, children, who, have, not, been, adopted, while, the, general, population, experienced, more, behavioral, problems, substance, use, lower, school, achievement, and, impaired, social, competence, after, parental, divorce, the, adoptee, population, appeared, to, be, unaffected, in, terms, of, their, outside, relationships, specifically, in, their, school, or, social, abilities, the, adoptee, population, does, however, seem, to, be, more, at, risk, for, certain, behavioral, issues, researchers, from, the, university, of, minnesota, studied, adolescents, who, had, been, adopted, and, found, that, adoptees, were, twice, as, likely, as, non, adopted, people, to, develop, oppositional, defiant, disorder, odd, and, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, with, an, 8, rate, in, the, general, population, suicide, risks, were, also, significantly, greater, than, the, general, population, swedish, researchers, found, both, international, and, domestic, adoptees, undertook, suicide, at, much, higher, rates, than, non, adopted, peers, with, international, adoptees, and, female, international, adoptees, in, particular, at, highest, risk, nevertheless, work, on, adult, adoptees, has, found, that, the, additional, risks, faced, by, adoptees, are, largely, confined, to, adolescence, young, adult, adoptees, were, shown, to, be, alike, with, adults, from, biological, families, and, scored, better, than, adults, raised, in, alternative, family, types, including, single, parent, and, step, families, moreover, while, adult, adoptees, showed, more, variability, than, their, non, adopted, peers, on, a, range, of, psychosocial, measures, adult, adoptees, exhibited, more, similarities, than, differences, with, adults, who, had, not, been, adopted, there, have, been, many, cases, of, remediation, or, the, reversibility, of, early, trauma, for, example, in, one, of, the, earliest, studies, conducted, professor, goldfarb, in, england, concluded, that, some, children, adjust, well, socially, and, emotionally, despite, their, negative, experiences, of, institutional, deprivation, in, early, childhood, other, researchers, also, found, that, prolonged, institutionalization, does, not, necessarily, lead, to, emotional, problems, or, character, defects, in, all, children, this, suggests, that, there, will, always, be, some, children, who, fare, well, who, are, resilient, regardless, of, their, experiences, in, early, childhood, furthermore, much, of, the, research, on, psychological, outcomes, for, adoptees, draws, from, clinical, populations, this, suggests, that, conclusions, such, that, adoptees, are, more, likely, to, have, behavioral, problems, such, as, odd, and, adhd, may, be, biased, since, the, proportion, of, adoptees, that, seek, mental, health, treatment, is, small, psychological, outcomes, for, adoptees, compared, to, those, for, the, general, population, are, more, similar, than, some, researchers, propose, while, adoption, studies, have, shown, that, by, adulthood, the, personalities, of, adopted, siblings, are, little, or, no, more, similar, than, random, pairs, of, strangers, the, parenting, style, of, adoptive, parents, may, still, play, a, role, in, the, outcome, of, their, adoptive, children, research, has, suggested, that, adoptive, parents, can, have, impacts, on, adoptees, as, well, several, recent, studies, have, shown, that, warm, adoptive, parenting, can, reduce, behavioral, problems, of, adopted, children, over, time, adopted, children, are, more, likely, to, experience, psychological, and, behavioral, problems, than, non, adopted, peers, children, who, were, older, than, four, at, the, time, of, their, adoption, experience, more, psychological, problems, than, those, who, were, younger, according, to, study, in, the, uk, adopted, children, can, have, mental, health, problems, that, do, not, improve, even, four, years, after, their, adoption, children, with, multiple, adverse, childhood, experiences, are, more, likely, to, have, mental, health, problems, the, study, suggests, that, to, identify, and, treat, mental, health, problems, early, care, professionals, and, the, adopting, parents, need, detailed, biographical, information, about, the, child, s, life, another, study, in, the, uk, suggests, that, adopted, children, are, more, likely, to, suffer, from, post, traumatic, stress, pts, than, the, general, population, their, pts, symptoms, depend, on, the, type, of, adverse, experiences, they, went, through, and, knowledge, of, their, history, offers, an, option, for, tailored, support, there, is, evidence, that, shows, the, adoptees, of, lgbt, families, and, those, in, heterosexual, families, have, no, significant, differences, in, development, one, of, the, main, arguments, used, against, same, sex, adoption, is, that, a, child, needs, a, mother, and, a, father, in, the, home, to, develop, properly, however, a, 2013, study, of, predictors, for, psychological, outcomes, of, adoptees, showed, that, family, type, hetero, gay, lesbian, does, not, affect, the, child, s, adjustment, rather, the, preparedness, of, the, adoptive, parent, s, and, health, of, relationship, to, partner, and, other, contextual, factors, predicted, later, adjustment, in, early, placed, adoptees, along, with, this, a, 2009, study, showed, again, that, sexual, orientation, of, parents, does, not, affect, externalizing, and, internalized, problems, but, family, functioning, and, income, can, affect, adjustment, especially, for, older, adoptees, late, discovery, adoption, is, a, term, used, to, describe, the, situation, where, an, adopted, individual, first, discovers, that, they, are, adopted, at, a, later, age, than, is, universally, considered, to, be, appropriate, often, well, into, adulthood, adopted, individuals, who, discover, their, adoption, status, at, a, later, age, are, referred, to, as, late, discovery, adoptees, ldas, failure, of, the, adoptive, parent, s, to, disclose, adoption, status, to, a, child, is, an, outdated, adoption, practice, that, was, once, fairly, common, for, adoptees, born, in, the, 1930s, 1940s, and, 1950s, since, the, 1970s, it, has, been, socially, unacceptable, to, keep, the, truth, from, adopted, individuals, regarding, their, genetic, origins, the, discovery, of, the, deception, regarding, true, parentage, and, that, one, is, in, fact, a, late, discovery, adoptee, can, add, layers, of, trauma, loss, betrayal, identity, confusion, and, disorganization, upon, learning, the, truth, in, western, culture, many, see, that, the, common, image, of, a, family, being, that, of, a, heterosexual, couple, with, biological, children, this, idea, places, alternative, family, forms, outside, the, norm, as, a, consequence, research, indicates, disparaging, views, of, adoptive, families, exist, along, with, doubts, concerning, the, strength, of, their, family, bonds, the, most, recent, adoption, attitudes, survey, completed, by, the, evan, donaldson, institute, provides, further, evidence, of, this, stigma, nearly, one, third, of, the, surveyed, population, believed, adoptees, are, less, well, adjusted, more, prone, to, medical, issues, and, predisposed, to, drug, and, alcohol, problems, additionally, 40, 45, thought, adoptees, were, more, likely, to, have, behavior, problems, and, trouble, at, school, in, contrast, the, same, study, indicated, adoptive, parents, were, viewed, favorably, with, nearly, 90, describing, them, as, lucky, advantaged, and, unselfish, the, majority, of, people, state, that, their, primary, source, of, information, about, adoption, comes, from, friends, and, family, and, the, news, media, nevertheless, most, people, report, the, media, provides, them, a, favorable, view, of, adoption, 72, indicated, receiving, positive, impressions, there, is, however, still, substantial, criticism, of, the, media, s, adoption, coverage, some, adoption, blogs, for, example, criticized, meet, the, robinsons, for, using, outdated, orphanage, imagery, as, did, advocacy, non, profit, the, evan, b, donaldson, adoption, institute, the, stigmas, associated, with, adoption, are, amplified, for, children, in, foster, care, negative, perceptions, result, in, the, belief, that, such, children, are, so, troubled, it, would, be, impossible, to, adopt, them, and, create, normal, families, a, 2004, report, from, the, pew, commission, on, children, in, foster, care, has, shown, that, the, number, of, children, waiting, in, foster, care, doubled, since, the, 1980s, and, now, remains, steady, at, about, a, half, million, a, year, attitude, toward, adoption, questionnaire, ataq, this, questionnaire, was, first, developed, by, abdollahzadeh, chaloyi, and, mahmoudi, 2019, preliminary, edition, this, questionnaire, has, 23, items, based, on, the, likert, scale, of, 1, totally, disagree, up, to, 5, totally, agree, being, obtained, after, refining, the, items, designed, to, construct, the, present, tool, and, per, study, study, the, analysis, of, item, and, initial, psychometric, analyses, indicate, that, there, are, two, factors, in, it, items, 3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, are, reversed, and, the, rest, are, graded, positively, the, results, of, exploratory, factor, analysis, by, main, components, with, varimax, rotation, indicated, two, components, of, attitude, toward, adoption, being, named, respectively, cognitive, as, the, aspects, of, attitude, toward, adoption, and, behavioral, emotional, aspects, of, attitude, toward, adoption, these, two, components, explained, 43, 25, of, the, variance, of, the, total, sample, cronbach, s, alpha, coefficient, was, used, to, measure, the, reliability, of, the, questionnaire, cronbach, s, alpha, coefficient, was, 0, 709, for, the, whole, questionnaire, 0, 71, for, the, first, component, and, 0, 713, for, the, second, one, in, addition, there, was, a, significant, positive, relationship, between, desired, social, tendencies, and, the, cognitive, aspect, of, attitude, toward, adoption, as, well, as, the, behavioral, emotional, aspects, of, attitude, toward, adoption, p, 0, 01, family, preservation, is, the, emphasis, that, if, possible, mothers, and, children, should, be, kept, together, in, the, u, s, this, was, clearly, illustrated, by, the, shift, in, policy, of, the, new, york, foundling, home, an, adoption, institution, that, is, among, the, country, s, oldest, and, one, that, had, pioneered, sealed, records, it, established, three, new, principles, including, to, prevent, placements, of, children, reflecting, the, belief, that, children, would, be, better, served, by, staying, with, their, biological, families, a, striking, shift, in, policy, that, remains, in, force, today, in, addition, groups, such, as, origins, usa, founded, in, 1997, started, to, actively, speak, about, family, preservation, and, the, rights, of, mothers, the, intellectual, tone, of, these, reform, movements, was, influenced, by, the, publishing, of, the, primal, wound, by, nancy, verrier, primal, wound, is, described, as, the, devastation, which, the, infant, feels, because, of, separation, from, its, birth, mother, it, is, the, deep, and, consequential, feeling, of, abandonment, which, the, baby, adoptee, feels, after, the, adoption, and, which, may, continue, for, the, rest, of, his, life, forced, adoption, has, also, been, enforced, with, the, rationale, of, child, welfare, the, children, of, unwed, or, single, mothers, are, commonly, the, target, of, such, forced, adoption, this, was, prominent, during, baby, scoop, era, in, the, 1950s, through, the, 1970s, in, the, anglosphere, the, children, of, parents, in, poverty, have, also, been, targeted, for, forced, adoption, under, the, rational, of, child, welfare, this, was, often, the, case, for, verdingkinder, or, contract, children, in, switzerland, between, the, 1850s, through, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, removing, children, of, ethnic, minorities, from, their, families, to, be, adopted, by, those, of, the, dominant, ethnic, group, has, been, used, as, a, method, of, forced, assimilation, forced, adoption, based, on, ethnicity, occurred, during, world, war, ii, in, german, occupied, poland, it, is, estimated, that, 200, 000, polish, children, with, purportedly, aryan, traits, were, removed, from, their, families, and, given, to, german, or, austrian, couples, and, only, 25, 000, returned, to, their, families, after, the, war, the, stolen, generation, of, aboriginal, people, in, australia, were, affected, by, similar, policies, as, were, native, americans, in, the, united, states, and, first, nations, of, canada, these, practices, have, become, significant, social, and, political, issues, in, recent, years, and, in, many, cases, the, policies, have, changed, the, united, states, for, example, now, has, the, 1978, indian, child, welfare, act, which, allows, the, tribe, and, family, of, a, native, american, child, to, be, involved, in, adoption, decisions, with, preference, being, given, to, adoption, within, the, child, s, tribe, while, forced, assimilation, usually, revolves, around, ethnicity, assimilating, children, of, political, minorities, has, also, occurred, in, spain, under, francisco, franco, s, 1939, 1975, dictatorship, the, newborns, of, some, left, wing, opponents, of, the, regime, or, unmarried, or, poor, couples, were, removed, from, their, mothers, and, adopted, new, mothers, were, frequently, told, their, babies, had, died, suddenly, after, birth, and, the, hospital, had, taken, care, of, their, burials, when, in, fact, they, were, given, or, sold, to, another, family, it, is, believed, that, up, to, 300, 000, babies, were, involved, these, system, which, allegedly, involved, doctors, nurses, nuns, and, priests, outlived, franco, s, death, in, 1975, and, carried, on, as, an, illegal, baby, trafficking, network, until, 1987, when, a, new, law, regulating, adoption, was, introduced, adoption, is, usually, managed, by, judges, bureaucrats, and, social, workers, profiting, from, giving, or, receiving, orphans, has, incentivized, abusive, practices, baby, farming, is, the, practice, of, accepting, custody, of, a, child, in, return, for, payment, this, was, most, common, in, victorian, britain, illegitimacy, and, its, attendant, social, stigma, were, usually, the, impetus, for, a, mother, s, decision, to, give, her, child, to, a, baby, farmer, baby, farmers, would, sometimes, neglect, or, murder, the, babies, to, keep, costs, down, child, harvesting, is, the, practice, of, rearing, human, children, to, be, sold, typically, for, adoption, poor, mothers, have, used, street, clinics, known, as, baby,

turning, a, profit, for, the, government, adoption, practices, have, changed, significantly, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, with, each, new, movement, labeled, in, some, way, as, reform, beginning, in, the, 1970s, efforts, to, improve, adoption, became, associated, with, opening, records, and, encouraging, family, preservation, these, ideas, arose, from, suggestions, that, the, secrecy, inherent, in, modern, adoption, may, influence, the, process, of, forming, an, identity, create, confusion, regarding, genealogy, and, provide, little, in, the, way, of, medical, history, open, records, after, a, legal, adoption, in, the, united, states, an, adopted, person, s, original, birth, certificate, is, usually, amended, and, replaced, with, a, new, post, adoption, birth, certificate, the, names, of, any, birth, parents, listed, on, the, original, birth, certificate, are, replaced, on, an, amended, certificate, with, the, names, of, the, adoptive, parents, making, it, appear, that, the, child, was, born, to, the, adoptive, parents, beginning, in, the, late, 1930s, and, continuing, through, the, 1970s, state, laws, allowed, for, the, sealing, of, original, birth, certificates, after, an, adoption, and, except, in, some, states, made, the, original, birth, certificate, unavailable, to, the, adopted, person, even, at, the, age, of, majority, adopted, people, have, long, sought, to, undo, these, laws, so, that, they, can, obtain, their, own, original, birth, certificates, movements, to, unseal, original, birth, certificates, and, other, adoption, records, for, adopted, people, proliferated, in, the, 1970s, along, with, increased, acceptance, of, illegitimacy, in, the, united, states, jean, paton, founded, orphan, voyage, in, 1954, and, florence, fisher, founded, the, adoptees, liberty, movement, association, alma, in, 1971, calling, sealed, records, an, affront, to, human, dignity, while, in, 1975, emma, may, vilardi, created, the, first, mutual, consent, registry, the, international, soundex, reunion, registry, isrr, allowing, those, separated, by, adoption, to, locate, one, another, and, lee, campbell, and, other, birthmothers, established, cub, concerned, united, birthparents, similar, ideas, were, taking, hold, globally, with, grass, roots, organizations, like, parent, finders, in, canada, and, jigsaw, in, australia, in, 1975, england, and, wales, opened, records, on, moral, grounds, by, 1979, representatives, of, 32, organizations, from, 33, states, canada, and, mexico, gathered, in, washington, dc, to, establish, the, american, adoption, congress, aac, passing, a, unanimous, resolution, open, records, complete, with, all, identifying, information, for, all, members, of, the, adoption, triad, birthparents, adoptive, parents, and, adoptee, at, the, adoptee, s, age, of, majority, 18, or, 19, depending, on, state, or, earlier, if, all, members, of, the, triad, agree, later, years, saw, the, evolution, of, more, militant, organizations, such, as, bastard, nation, founded, in, 1996, groups, that, helped, overturn, sealed, records, in, alabama, delaware, new, hampshire, oregon, tennessee, and, maine, a, coalition, of, new, york, and, national, adoptee, rights, activists, successfully, worked, to, overturn, a, restrictive, 83, year, old, law, in, 2019, and, adult, adopted, people, born, in, new, york, as, well, as, their, descendants, today, have, the, right, to, request, and, obtain, their, own, original, birth, certificates, as, of, 2021, ten, states, in, the, united, states, recognize, the, right, of, adult, adopted, people, to, obtain, their, own, original, birth, certificates, including, alabama, alaska, colorado, connecticut, kansas, maine, new, hampshire, new, york, oregon, and, rhode, island, connecticut, in, 2021, became, the, tenth, state, to, restore, an, adopted, person, s, right, to, request, and, obtain, their, original, birth, certificates, the, language, of, adoption, is, changing, and, evolving, and, since, the, 1970s, has, been, a, controversial, issue, tied, closely, to, adoption, reform, efforts, the, controversy, arises, over, the, use, of, terms, which, while, designed, to, be, more, appealing, or, less, offensive, to, some, persons, affected, by, adoption, may, simultaneously, cause, offense, or, insult, to, others, this, controversy, illustrates, the, problems, in, adoption, as, well, as, the, fact, that, coining, new, words, and, phrases, to, describe, ancient, social, practices, will, not, necessarily, alter, the, feelings, and, experiences, of, those, affected, by, them, two, of, the, contrasting, sets, of, terms, are, commonly, referred, to, as, positive, adoption, language, pal, sometimes, called, respectful, adoption, language, ral, and, honest, adoption, language, hal, in, the, 1970s, as, adoption, search, and, support, organizations, developed, there, were, challenges, to, the, language, in, common, use, at, the, time, as, books, like, adoption, triangle, by, sorosky, pannor, and, baran, were, published, and, support, groups, formed, like, cub, concerned, united, birthparents, a, major, shift, from, natural, parent, to, birthparent, occurred, along, with, the, change, in, times, and, social, attitudes, came, additional, examination, of, the, language, used, in, adoption, social, workers, and, other, professionals, in, the, field, of, adoption, began, changing, terms, of, use, to, reflect, what, was, being, expressed, by, the, parties, involved, in, 1979, marietta, spencer, wrote, the, terminology, of, adoption, for, the, child, welfare, league, of, america, cwla, which, was, the, basis, for, her, later, work, constructive, adoption, terminology, this, influenced, pat, johnston, s, positive, adoption, language, pal, and, respectful, adoption, language, ral, the, terms, contained, in, positive, adoption, language, include, the, terms, birth, mother, to, replace, the, terms, natural, mother, and, real, mother, and, placing, to, replace, the, term, surrender, these, kinds, of, recommendations, encouraged, people, to, be, more, aware, of, their, use, of, adoption, terminology, honest, adoption, language, refers, to, a, set, of, terms, that, proponents, say, reflect, the, point, of, view, that, 1, family, relationships, social, emotional, psychological, or, physical, that, existed, prior, to, the, legal, adoption, often, continue, past, this, point, or, endure, in, some, form, despite, long, periods, of, separation, and, that, 2, mothers, who, have, voluntarily, surrendered, children, to, adoption, as, opposed, to, involuntary, terminations, through, court, authorized, child, welfare, proceedings, seldom, view, it, as, a, choice, that, was, freely, made, but, instead, describe, scenarios, of, powerlessness, lack, of, resources, and, overall, lack, of, choice, it, also, reflects, the, point, of, view, that, the, term, birth, mother, is, derogatory, in, implying, that, the, woman, has, ceased, being, a, mother, after, the, physical, act, of, giving, birth, proponents, of, hal, liken, this, to, the, mother, being, treated, as, a, breeder, or, incubator, terms, included, in, hal, include, terms, that, were, used, before, pal, including, natural, mother, first, mother, and, surrendered, for, adoption, there, are, supporters, of, various, lists, developed, over, many, decades, and, there, are, persons, who, find, them, lacking, created, to, support, an, agenda, or, furthering, division, all, terminology, can, be, used, to, demean, or, diminish, uplift, or, embrace, in, addressing, the, linguistic, problem, of, naming, edna, andrews, says, that, using, inclusive, and, neutral, language, is, based, upon, the, concept, that, language, represents, thought, and, may, even, control, thought, advocates, of, inclusive, language, defend, it, as, inoffensive, language, usage, whose, goal, is, multi, fold, a, common, problem, is, that, terms, chosen, by, an, identity, group, as, acceptable, descriptors, of, themselves, can, be, used, in, negative, ways, by, detractors, this, compromises, the, integrity, of, the, language, and, turns, what, was, intended, to, be, positive, into, negative, or, vice, versa, thus, often, devaluing, acceptability, meaning, and, use, language, at, its, best, honors, the, self, referencing, choices, of, the, persons, involved, uses, inclusive, terms, and, phrases, and, is, sensitive, to, the, feelings, of, the, primary, parties, language, evolves, with, social, attitudes, and, experiences, estimates, for, the, extent, of, search, behavior, by, adoptees, have, proven, elusive, studies, show, significant, variation, in, part, the, problem, stems, from, the, small, adoptee, population, which, makes, random, surveying, difficult, if, not, impossible, nevertheless, some, indication, of, the, level, of, search, interest, by, adoptees, can, be, gleaned, from, the, case, of, england, and, wales, which, opened, adoptees, birth, records, in, 1975, the, u, k, office, for, national, statistics, has, projected, that, 33, of, all, adoptees, would, eventually, request, a, copy, of, their, original, birth, records, exceeding, original, forecasts, made, in, 1975, when, it, was, believed, that, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, adoptee, population, would, request, their, records, the, projection, is, known, to, underestimate, the, true, search, rate, however, since, many, adoptees, of, the, era, get, their, birth, records, by, other, means, the, research, literature, states, adoptees, give, four, reasons, for, desiring, reunion, 1, they, wish, for, a, more, complete, genealogy, 2, they, are, curious, about, events, leading, to, their, conception, birth, and, relinquishment, 3, they, hope, to, pass, on, information, to, their, children, and, 4, they, have, a, need, for, a, detailed, biological, background, including, medical, information, it, is, speculated, by, adoption, researchers, however, that, the, reasons, given, are, incomplete, although, such, information, could, be, communicated, by, a, third, party, interviews, with, adoptees, who, sought, reunion, found, they, expressed, a, need, to, actually, meet, biological, relations, it, appears, the, desire, for, reunion, is, linked, to, the, adoptee, s, interaction, with, and, acceptance, within, the, community, internally, focused, theories, suggest, some, adoptees, possess, ambiguities, in, their, sense, of, self, impairing, their, ability, to, present, a, consistent, identity, reunion, helps, resolve, the, lack, of, self, knowledge, externally, focused, theories, in, contrast, suggest, that, reunion, is, a, way, for, adoptees, to, overcome, social, stigma, first, proposed, by, goffman, the, theory, has, four, parts, 1, adoptees, perceive, the, absence, of, biological, ties, as, distinguishing, their, adoptive, family, from, others, 2, this, understanding, is, strengthened, by, experiences, where, non, adoptees, suggest, adoptive, ties, are, weaker, than, blood, ties, 3, together, these, factors, engender, in, some, adoptees, a, sense, of, social, exclusion, and, 4, these, adoptees, react, by, searching, for, a, blood, tie, that, reinforces, their, membership, in, the, community, the, externally, focused, rationale, for, reunion, suggests, adoptees, may, be, well, adjusted, and, happy, within, their, adoptive, families, but, will, search, as, an, attempt, to, resolve, experiences, of, social, stigma, some, adoptees, reject, the, idea, of, reunion, it, is, unclear, though, what, differentiates, adoptees, who, search, from, those, who, do, not, one, paper, summarizes, the, research, stating, attempts, to, draw, distinctions, between, the, searcher, and, non, searcher, are, no, more, conclusive, or, generalizable, than, attempts, to, substantiate, differences, between, adoptees, and, nonadoptees, in, sum, reunions, can, bring, a, variety, of, issues, for, adoptees, and, parents, nevertheless, most, reunion, results, appear, to, be, positive, in, the, largest, study, to, date, based, on, the, responses, of, 1, 007, adoptees, and, relinquishing, parents, 90, responded, that, reunion, was, a, beneficial, experience, this, does, not, however, imply, ongoing, relationships, were, formed, between, adoptee, and, parent, nor, that, this, was, the, goal, attitudes, and, laws, regarding, adoption, vary, greatly, whereas, all, cultures, make, arrangements, whereby, children, whose, birth, parents, are, unavailable, to, rear, them, can, be, brought, up, by, others, not, all, cultures, have, the, concept, of, adoption, that, is, treating, unrelated, children, as, equivalent, to, biological, children, of, the, adoptive, parents, under, islamic, law, for, example, adopted, children, must, keep, their, original, surname, to, be, identified, with, blood, relations, and, traditionally, women, wear, a, hijab, in, the, presence, of, males, in, their, adoptive, households, in, egypt, these, cultural, distinctions, have, led, to, making, adoption, illegal, opting, instead, for, a, system, of, foster, care, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, homecoming, day, is, the, day, when, an, adoptee, is, officially, united, with, their, new, adoptive, family
