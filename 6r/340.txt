the, ancient, olympic, games, ancient, greek, ta, olympia, were, a, series, of, athletic, competitions, among, representatives, of, city, states, and, one, of, the, panhellenic, games, of, ancient, greece, they, were, held, at, the, panhellenic, religious, sanctuary, of, olympia, in, honor, of, zeus, and, the, greeks, gave, them, a, mythological, origin, the, originating, olympic, games, are, traditionally, dated, to, 776, bc, the, games, were, held, every, four, years, or, olympiad, which, became, a, unit, of, time, in, historical, chronologies, these, olympiads, were, referred, to, based, on, the, winner, of, their, stadion, sprint, e, g, the, third, year, of, the, eighteenth, olympiad, when, ladas, of, argos, won, the, stadion, they, continued, to, be, celebrated, when, greece, came, under, roman, rule, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, their, last, recorded, celebration, was, in, ad, 393, under, the, emperor, theodosius, i, but, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, some, games, were, still, held, after, this, date, the, games, likely, came, to, an, end, under, theodosius, ii, possibly, in, connection, with, a, fire, that, burned, down, the, temple, of, the, olympian, zeus, during, his, reign, during, the, celebration, of, the, games, the, olympic, truce, ekecheir, a, was, announced, so, that, athletes, and, religious, pilgrims, could, travel, from, their, cities, to, the, games, in, safety, the, prizes, for, the, victors, were, olive, leaf, wreaths, or, crowns, the, games, became, a, political, tool, used, by, city, states, to, assert, dominance, over, their, rival, city, states, politicians, would, announce, political, alliances, at, the, games, and, in, times, of, war, priests, would, offer, sacrifices, to, the, gods, for, victory, the, games, were, also, used, to, help, spread, hellenistic, culture, throughout, the, mediterranean, the, olympics, also, featured, religious, celebrations, the, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, was, counted, as, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, sculptors, and, poets, would, congregate, each, olympiad, to, display, their, works, of, art, to, would, be, patrons, the, ancient, olympics, had, fewer, events, than, the, modern, games, and, for, many, years, only, freeborn, greek, men, were, allowed, to, participate, although, there, were, victorious, women, chariot, owners, moreover, throughout, their, history, the, olympics, both, ancient, and, modern, have, occasionally, become, arenas, where, political, expressions, such, as, demonstrations, boycotts, and, embargoes, have, been, employed, by, nations, and, individuals, to, exert, influence, over, these, sporting, events, as, long, as, they, met, the, entrance, criteria, athletes, from, any, greek, city, state, and, kingdom, were, allowed, to, participate, the, games, were, always, held, at, olympia, rather, than, moving, between, different, locations, like, the, modern, olympic, games, victors, at, the, olympics, were, honored, and, their, feats, chronicled, for, future, generations, to, the, ancient, greeks, it, was, important, to, root, the, olympic, games, in, mythology, during, the, time, of, the, ancient, games, their, origins, were, attributed, to, the, gods, and, competing, legends, persisted, as, to, who, actually, was, responsible, for, the, genesis, of, the, games, the, patterns, that, emerge, from, these, legends, are, that, the, greeks, believed, the, games, had, their, roots, in, religion, that, athletic, competition, was, tied, to, worship, of, the, gods, and, the, revival, of, the, ancient, games, was, intended, to, bring, peace, harmony, and, a, return, to, the, origins, of, greek, life, these, origin, traditions, have, become, nearly, impossible, to, untangle, yet, a, chronology, and, patterns, have, arisen, that, help, people, understand, the, story, behind, the, games, greek, historian, pausanias, provides, a, story, about, the, dactyl, heracles, not, to, be, confused, with, the, hercules, who, was, the, son, of, zeus, and, joined, the, roman, pantheon, and, four, of, his, brothers, paeonaeus, epimedes, iasius, and, idas, who, raced, at, olympia, to, entertain, the, newborn, zeus, he, crowned, the, victor, with, an, olive, wreath, which, thus, became, a, peace, symbol, which, also, explains, the, four, year, interval, bringing, the, games, around, every, fifth, year, counting, inclusively, the, other, olympian, gods, so, named, because, they, lived, permanently, on, mount, olympus, would, also, engage, in, wrestling, jumping, and, running, contests, another, myth, of, the, origin, of, the, games, is, the, story, of, pelops, a, local, olympian, hero, oenomaus, the, king, of, pisa, had, a, daughter, named, hippodamia, and, according, to, an, oracle, the, king, would, be, killed, by, her, husband, therefore, he, decreed, that, any, young, man, who, wanted, to, marry, his, daughter, was, required, to, drive, away, with, her, in, his, chariot, and, oenomaus, would, follow, in, another, chariot, and, spear, the, suitor, if, he, caught, up, with, them, now, the, king, s, chariot, horses, were, a, present, from, the, god, poseidon, and, therefore, supernaturally, fast, the, king, s, daughter, fell, in, love, with, a, man, called, pelops, before, the, race, however, pelops, persuaded, oenomaus, charioteer, myrtilus, to, replace, the, bronze, axle, pins, of, the, king, s, chariot, with, wax, ones, naturally, during, the, race, the, wax, melted, and, the, king, fell, from, his, chariot, and, was, killed, after, his, victory, pelops, organized, chariot, races, as, a, thanksgiving, to, the, gods, and, as, funeral, games, in, honor, of, king, oenomaus, in, order, to, be, purified, of, his, death, it, was, from, this, funeral, race, held, at, olympia, that, the, beginnings, of, the, olympic, games, were, inspired, pelops, became, a, great, king, a, local, hero, and, he, gave, his, name, to, the, peloponnese, one, later, myth, attributed, to, pindar, states, that, the, festival, at, olympia, involved, heracles, the, son, of, zeus, according, to, pindar, heracles, established, an, athletic, festival, to, honor, his, father, zeus, after, he, had, completed, his, labors, the, olympic, games, were, held, to, be, one, of, the, two, central, rituals, in, ancient, greece, the, other, being, the, much, older, religious, festival, the, eleusinian, mysteries, areas, around, the, mediterranean, had, a, long, tradition, of, athletic, events, ancient, egyptians, and, mesopotamians, depicted, athletic, scenes, in, tombs, of, kings, and, their, nobles, they, did, not, however, hold, regular, competitions, and, those, events, that, occurred, were, probably, the, preserve, of, kings, and, upper, classes, minoan, culture, held, gymnastics, in, high, esteem, with, bull, leaping, tumbling, running, wrestling, and, boxing, shown, on, their, frescoes, the, mycenaeans, adopted, minoan, games, and, also, raced, chariots, in, religious, or, funerary, ceremonies, homer, s, heroes, participate, in, athletic, competitions, to, honor, the, dead, in, the, iliad, there, are, chariot, races, boxing, wrestling, a, foot, race, as, well, as, fencing, archery, and, spear, throwing, the, odyssey, adds, to, these, a, long, jump, and, discus, throw, aristotle, reckoned, the, date, of, the, first, olympics, to, be, 776, bc, a, date, largely, accepted, by, most, though, not, all, subsequent, ancient, historians, this, is, the, traditionally, given, date, and, archaeological, finds, confirm, approximately, the, olympics, starting, at, or, soon, after, this, time, while, this, specific, date, of, origin, cannot, be, verified, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, games, date, from, some, time, in, the, 8th, century, bc, archaeology, suggests, that, major, games, at, olympia, arose, probably, around, 700, christesen, s, important, work, on, the, olympic, victor, lists, shows, that, victors, names, and, details, were, unreliable, until, the, sixth, century, elis, s, independent, state, administered, it, and, while, the, eleans, managed, the, games, well, there, sometimes, was, bias, and, interference, also, despite, modern, illusions, the, famous, olympic, truce, only, mandated, safe, passage, for, visitors, it, did, not, stop, all, wars, in, greece, or, even, at, olympia, the, historian, ephorus, who, lived, in, the, fourth, century, bc, is, one, potential, candidate, for, establishing, the, use, of, olympiads, to, count, years, although, credit, for, codifying, this, particular, epoch, usually, falls, to, hippias, of, elis, to, eratosthenes, or, even, to, timaeus, whom, eratosthenes, may, have, imitated, the, olympic, games, were, held, at, four, year, intervals, and, later, the, ancient, historians, method, of, counting, the, years, even, referred, to, these, games, using, olympiad, for, the, period, between, two, games, previously, the, local, dating, systems, of, the, greek, states, were, used, they, continued, to, be, used, by, everyone, except, historians, which, led, to, confusion, when, trying, to, determine, dates, for, example, diodorus, states, that, there, was, a, solar, eclipse, in, the, third, year, of, the, 113th, olympiad, which, must, be, the, eclipse, of, 316, bc, this, gives, a, date, of, mid, summer, 765, bc, for, the, first, year, of, the, first, olympiad, nevertheless, there, is, disagreement, among, scholars, as, to, when, the, games, began, according, to, the, later, greek, traveler, pausanias, who, wrote, in, 175, ad, the, only, competition, held, at, first, was, the, stadion, a, race, over, about, 190, metres, 620, feet, the, word, stadium, is, derived, from, this, event, several, groups, fought, over, control, of, the, sanctuary, at, olympia, and, hence, the, games, for, prestige, and, political, advantage, pausanias, later, writes, that, in, 668, bc, pheidon, of, argos, was, commissioned, by, the, town, of, pisa, to, capture, the, sanctuary, from, the, town, of, elis, which, he, did, and, then, personally, controlled, the, games, for, that, year, the, next, year, elis, regained, control, greek, sports, also, derived, its, origins, from, the, concept, that, physical, energy, was, being, expended, in, a, ritualistic, manner, in, which, paleolithic, age, hunting, practices, were, turned, into, a, more, socially, and, glamorized, function, thus, becoming, sport, the, greeks, in, particular, were, unique, in, the, regard, that, their, competitions, were, often, held, in, grand, facilities, with, prizes, and, nudity, that, stressed, the, greek, idealisms, of, training, one, s, body, to, be, as, fit, as, their, mind, it, is, this, ideology, and, athletic, exceptionalism, that, resulted, in, theories, claiming, the, greeks, were, the, inventors, of, sport, in, the, first, 200, years, of, the, games, existence, they, only, had, regional, religious, importance, only, greeks, in, proximity, to, olympia, competed, in, these, early, games, this, is, evidenced, by, the, dominance, of, peloponnesian, athletes, in, the, victors, roles, over, time, the, olympic, games, gained, increasing, recognition, and, became, part, of, the, panhellenic, games, four, separate, games, held, at, two, or, four, year, intervals, but, arranged, so, that, there, was, at, least, one, set, of, games, every, year, the, other, panhellenic, games, were, the, pythian, nemean, and, isthmian, games, though, the, olympic, games, being, the, oldest, among, the, rest, were, considered, the, most, prestigious, participation, in, the, olympic, games, was, reserved, for, freeborn, greek, men, although, there, were, also, greek, women, who, were, victorious, as, chariot, owners, authorities, differ, as, to, whether, females, were, allowed, to, attend, the, competitions, some, say, all, females, were, excluded, from, the, sacred, precinct, where, the, games, took, place, while, others, cite, pausanias, who, indicated, that, parthenoi, maidens, could, view, the, competitions, but, not, gynaikes, married, women, who, had, to, remain, on, the, south, side, of, the, river, alpheios, the, evidence, regarding, the, attendance, of, women, in, the, olympics, is, inconclusive, nevertheless, there, is, no, specific, evidence, suggesting, that, women, were, excluded, from, attending, the, other, panhellenic, or, panathenaic, contests, after, the, roman, conquest, of, greece, the, olympics, continued, but, the, event, declined, in, popularity, throughout, the, pre, augustan, era, during, this, period, romans, largely, concentrated, on, domestic, problems, and, paid, less, attention, to, their, provinces, the, fact, that, all, equestrian, victors, were, from, the, immediate, locality, and, that, there, is, a, paucity, of, victor, statues, in, the, altis, from, this, period, suggests, the, games, were, somewhat, neglected, in, 86, bc, the, roman, general, sulla, robbed, olympia, and, other, greek, treasuries, to, finance, a, war, he, was, the, only, roman, to, commit, violence, against, olympia, sulla, hosted, the, games, in, 80, bc, the, 175th, olympiad, as, a, celebration, of, his, victories, over, mithridates, supposedly, the, only, contest, held, was, the, stadion, race, because, all, the, athletes, had, been, called, to, rome, under, the, rule, of, emperor, augustus, the, olympics, underwent, a, revival, before, he, came, to, full, power, augustus, right, hand, man, marcus, agrippa, restored, the, damaged, temple, of, zeus, and, in, 12, bc, augustus, asked, king, herod, of, judea, to, subsidize, the, games, after, augustus, was, declared, a, god, by, the, senate, after, his, death, a, statue, of, his, likeness, was, commissioned, at, olympia, subsequent, divine, emperors, also, had, statues, erected, within, the, sacred, altis, the, stadium, was, renovated, at, his, command, and, greek, athletics, in, general, were, subsidized, one, of, the, most, infamous, events, of, olympic, history, occurred, under, the, rule, of, nero, he, desired, victory, in, all, chariot, races, of, the, panhellenic, games, in, a, single, year, so, he, ordered, the, four, main, hosts, to, hold, their, games, in, ad, 67, and, therefore, the, scheduled, olympics, of, 65, in, the, 211th, olympiad, were, postponed, at, olympia, he, was, thrown, from, his, chariot, but, still, claimed, victory, nero, also, considered, himself, a, talented, musician, so, he, added, contests, in, music, and, singing, to, those, festivals, that, lacked, them, including, the, olympics, nero, won, all, of, those, contests, no, doubt, because, judges, were, afraid, to, award, victory, to, anyone, else, after, his, suicide, the, olympic, judges, had, to, repay, the, bribes, he, had, bestowed, and, declared, the, neronian, olympiad, to, be, void, in, the, first, half, of, the, second, century, the, philhellenic, emperors, hadrian, and, antoninus, pius, oversaw, a, new, and, successful, phase, in, the, history, of, the, games, the, olympics, attracted, a, great, number, of, spectators, and, competitors, and, the, victors, fame, spread, across, the, roman, empire, the, renaissance, endured, for, most, of, the, second, century, once, again, philosophers, orators, artists, religious, proselytizers, singers, and, all, kinds, of, performers, went, to, the, festival, of, zeus, the, 3rd, century, saw, a, decline, in, the, popularity, of, the, games, the, victory, list, of, africanus, ends, at, the, 249th, olympiad, 217, though, moses, of, chorene, s, history, of, armenia, lists, a, boxing, winner, from, as, late, as, 369, the, 287th, olympiad, excavated, inscriptions, also, show, the, games, continued, past, 217, until, recently, the, last, securely, datable, winner, was, publius, asclepiades, of, corinth, who, won, the, pentathlon, in, 241, the, 255th, olympiad, in, 1994, a, bronze, plaque, was, found, inscribed, with, victors, of, the, combative, events, hailing, from, the, mainland, and, asia, minor, proof, that, an, international, olympic, games, continued, until, at, least, 385, the, 291st, olympiad, the, games, continued, past, 385, by, which, time, flooding, and, earthquakes, had, damaged, the, buildings, and, invasions, by, barbarians, had, reached, olympia, the, last, recorded, games, were, held, under, theodosius, i, in, 393, at, the, start, of, the, 293rd, olympiad, but, archeological, evidence, indicates, that, some, games, were, still, held, areas, of, note, 2, prytaneion, 4, temple, of, hera, 5, pelopion, 10, stadium, 15, temple, of, zeus, 20, gymnasium, 21, palaestra, 26, greek, baths, 29, leonidaion, 31, bouleuterion, olympia, lies, in, the, valley, of, the, alfei, s, river, romanized, as, alpheus, in, the, western, part, of, the, peloponnese, today, around, 18, km, 11, mi, away, from, the, ionian, sea, but, perhaps, in, antiquity, half, that, distance, the, altis, as, the, sanctuary, as, was, originally, known, was, an, irregular, quadrangular, area, more, than, 180, meters, 590, 5, feet, on, each, side, and, walled, except, to, the, north, where, it, was, bounded, by, the, mount, kronos, it, consisted, of, a, somewhat, disordered, arrangement, of, buildings, the, most, important, of, which, are, the, temple, of, hera, the, temple, of, zeus, the, pelopion, and, the, area, of, the, great, altar, of, zeus, where, the, largest, sacrifices, were, made, the, name, altis, was, derived, from, a, corruption, of, the, elean, word, also, meaning, the, grove, because, the, area, was, wooded, olive, and, plane, trees, in, particular, uninhabited, throughout, the, year, when, the, games, were, held, the, site, became, over, congested, there, were, no, permanent, living, structures, for, spectators, who, rich, or, poor, made, do, with, tents, ancient, visitors, recall, being, plagued, by, summer, heat, and, flies, such, a, problem, that, sacrifices, were, made, to, zeus, averter, of, flies, the, site, s, water, supply, and, sanitation, were, finally, improved, after, nearly, a, thousand, years, by, the, mid, second, century, ad, but, you, may, say, there, are, some, things, disagreeable, and, troublesome, in, life, and, are, there, none, at, olympia, are, you, not, scorched, are, you, not, pressed, by, a, crowd, are, you, not, without, comfortable, means, of, bathing, are, you, not, wet, when, it, rains, have, you, not, abundance, of, noise, clamour, and, other, disagreeable, things, but, i, suppose, that, setting, all, these, things, off, against, the, magnificence, of, the, spectacle, you, bear, and, endure, the, ancient, olympics, were, as, much, a, religious, festival, as, an, athletic, event, the, games, were, held, in, honor, of, the, greek, god, zeus, and, on, the, middle, day, of, the, games, 100, oxen, would, be, sacrificed, to, him, over, time, olympia, the, site, of, the, games, became, a, central, spot, for, the, worship, of, the, head, of, the, greek, pantheon, and, a, temple, built, by, the, greek, architect, libon, was, erected, on, the, mountaintop, the, temple, was, one, of, the, largest, doric, temples, in, greece, the, sculptor, pheidias, created, a, statue, of, zeus, made, of, gold, and, ivory, it, stood, 42, feet, 13, m, tall, it, was, placed, on, a, throne, in, the, temple, the, statue, became, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, as, the, historian, strabo, put, it, the, glory, of, the, temple, persisted, on, account, both, of, the, festal, assembly, and, of, the, olympian, games, in, which, the, prize, was, a, crown, and, which, were, regarded, as, sacred, the, greatest, games, in, the, world, the, temple, was, adorned, by, its, numerous, offerings, which, were, dedicated, there, from, all, parts, of, greece, artistic, expression, was, a, major, part, of, the, games, sculptors, poets, painters, and, other, artisans, would, come, to, the, games, to, display, their, works, in, what, became, an, artistic, competition, poets, would, be, commissioned, to, write, poems, in, praise, of, the, olympic, victors, such, victory, songs, or, epinicians, were, passed, on, from, generation, to, generation, and, many, of, them, have, lasted, far, longer, than, any, other, honor, made, for, the, same, purpose, pausanias, claimed, that, the, destroyed, sicilian, polis, of, naxos, would, have, been, completely, forgotten, if, not, for, its, four, time, olympic, champion, tisandros, pierre, de, coubertin, one, of, the, founders, of, the, modern, olympic, games, wanted, to, fully, imitate, the, ancient, olympics, in, every, way, included, in, his, vision, was, an, artistic, competition, modeled, on, the, ancient, olympics, and, held, every, four, years, during, the, celebration, of, the, olympic, games, his, desire, came, to, fruition, at, the, olympics, held, in, athens, in, 1896, power, in, ancient, greece, became, centered, around, the, city, state, polis, in, the, 8th, century, bc, the, city, state, was, a, population, center, organized, into, a, self, contained, political, entity, every, city, state, worshiped, the, same, pantheon, of, gods, although, each, one, often, gave, more, emphasis, on, a, limited, group, of, deities, and, celebrated, religious, festivals, based, on, various, calendars, these, city, states, often, lived, in, close, proximity, to, each, other, which, created, competition, for, limited, resources, though, conflict, between, the, city, states, was, ubiquitous, it, was, also, in, their, self, interest, to, engage, in, trade, military, alliances, and, cultural, interaction, the, city, states, had, a, dichotomous, relationship, with, each, other, on, one, hand, they, relied, on, their, neighbors, for, political, and, military, alliances, while, on, the, other, they, competed, fiercely, with, those, same, neighbors, for, vital, resources, in, this, political, context, the, olympic, games, served, as, a, venue, for, representatives, of, the, city, states, to, peacefully, compete, against, each, other, from, the, 8th, century, bc, onwards, the, city, states, expanded, with, the, establishment, of, colonies, in, the, mediterranean, and, the, black, sea, while, their, cults, and, sanctuaries, provided, a, sense, of, identity, those, local, identities, as, well, as, the, increasing, contacts, with, non, greek, populations, presented, the, greeks, with, the, need, to, define, themselves, not, only, as, members, of, a, certain, polis, but, also, as, hellenes, that, was, made, possible, on, the, basis, of, a, common, language, and, a, body, of, shared, myths, and, legends, their, fondness, in, athletic, festivals, and, religious, observance, were, additionally, important, factors, for, the, greek, self, definition, as, such, a, small, number, of, religious, festivals, assumed, a, panhellenic, character, and, were, reserved, for, members, of, all, greek, city, states, the, oldest, of, them, being, the, olympic, games, a, body, of, officials, was, responsible, for, determining, the, city, state, of, origin, and, the, greek, identity, of, the, competitors, known, as, hellanodikai, the, spread, of, greek, colonies, in, the, 6th, and, 5th, centuries, bc, is, repeatedly, linked, to, successful, olympic, athletes, for, example, pausanias, recounts, that, cyrene, was, founded, c, 630, bc, by, settlers, from, thera, with, spartan, support, the, support, sparta, gave, was, primarily, the, loan, of, three, time, olympic, champion, chionis, the, appeal, of, settling, with, an, olympic, champion, helped, to, populate, the, colonies, and, maintain, cultural, and, political, ties, with, the, city, states, near, olympia, thus, hellenic, culture, and, the, games, spread, while, the, primacy, of, olympia, persisted, during, the, olympic, games, a, truce, or, ekecheiria, was, observed, three, runners, known, as, spondophoroi, were, sent, from, elis, to, the, participant, cities, at, each, set, of, games, to, announce, the, beginning, of, the, truce, during, this, period, armies, were, forbidden, from, entering, olympia, legal, disputes, and, the, use, of, the, death, penalty, were, forbidden, the, truce, primarily, designed, to, allow, athletes, and, visitors, to, travel, safely, to, the, games, was, for, the, most, part, observed, thucydides, wrote, of, a, situation, when, the, spartans, were, forbidden, from, attending, the, games, and, the, violators, of, the, truce, were, fined, 2, 000, minae, for, assaulting, the, city, of, lepreum, during, the, period, of, the, ekecheiria, the, spartans, disputed, the, fine, and, claimed, that, the, truce, had, not, yet, taken, hold, the, games, faced, a, serious, challenge, during, the, peloponnesian, war, which, primarily, pitted, athens, against, sparta, but, in, reality, touched, nearly, every, hellenic, city, state, the, olympics, were, used, during, this, time, to, announce, alliances, and, offer, sacrifices, to, the, gods, for, victory, while, a, martial, truce, was, observed, by, all, participating, city, states, no, such, reprieve, from, conflict, existed, in, the, political, arena, the, olympic, games, evolved, the, most, influential, athletic, and, cultural, stage, in, ancient, greece, and, arguably, in, the, ancient, world, as, such, the, games, became, a, vehicle, for, city, states, to, promote, themselves, the, result, was, political, intrigue, and, controversy, for, example, pausanias, a, greek, historian, explains, the, situation, of, the, athlete, sotades, sotades, at, the, ninety, ninth, festival, was, victorious, in, the, long, race, and, proclaimed, a, cretan, as, in, fact, he, was, but, at, the, next, festival, he, made, himself, an, ephesian, being, bribed, to, do, so, by, the, ephesian, people, for, this, act, he, was, banished, by, the, cretans, apparently, starting, with, just, a, single, foot, race, the, program, gradually, increased, to, twenty, three, contests, although, no, more, than, twenty, featured, at, any, one, olympiad, participation, in, most, events, was, limited, to, male, athletes, except, for, women, who, were, allowed, to, take, part, by, entering, horses, in, the, equestrian, events, youth, events, are, recorded, as, starting, in, 632, bc, our, knowledge, of, how, the, events, were, performed, primarily, derives, from, the, paintings, of, athletes, found, on, many, vases, particularly, those, of, the, archaic, and, classical, periods, competitors, had, access, to, two, gymnasiums, for, training, purposes, the, xystos, meaning, scraped, an, open, colonnade, or, running, track, for, the, runners, and, pentathletes, and, the, tetragono, for, wrestlers, and, boxers, a, loincloth, known, as, the, perizoma, was, initially, worn, by, athletes, at, the, ancient, olympic, games, archaeological, evidence, from, late, sixth, century, bc, reveals, athletes, sporting, this, garment, during, competitions, for, most, of, its, history, olympic, events, were, performed, in, the, nude, a, habit, which, the, greeks, felt, distinguished, them, from, non, greeks, pausanias, says, that, the, first, naked, runner, was, orsippus, winner, of, the, stadion, race, in, 720, bc, who, simply, lost, his, garment, on, purpose, because, running, without, it, was, easier, the, 5th, century, bc, historian, thucydides, credits, the, spartans, with, introducing, the, custom, of, publicly, stripping, and, anointing, themselves, with, oil, in, their, gymnastic, exercises, he, continues, saying, that, formerly, even, in, the, olympic, contests, the, athletes, who, contended, wore, belts, across, their, middles, and, it, is, but, a, few, years, since, that, the, practice, ceased, the, only, event, recorded, at, the, first, thirteen, games, was, the, stade, a, straight, line, sprint, of, just, over, 192, metres, 630, feet, the, diaulos, lit, double, pipe, or, two, stade, race, is, recorded, as, being, introduced, at, the, 14th, olympiad, in, 724, bc, it, is, thought, that, competitors, ran, in, lanes, marked, out, with, lime, or, gypsum, for, the, length, of, a, stade, then, turned, around, separate, posts, kampteres, before, returning, to, the, start, line, xenophanes, wrote, that, victory, by, speed, of, foot, is, honored, above, all, a, third, foot, race, the, dolichos, long, race, was, introduced, in, the, next, olympiad, accounts, of, the, race, s, distance, differ, it, seems, to, have, been, from, twenty, to, twenty, four, laps, of, the, track, around, 7, 5, km, to, 9, km, 4, 6, to, 5, 6, mi, although, it, may, have, been, lengths, rather, than, laps, and, thus, half, as, far, the, last, running, event, added, to, the, olympic, program, was, the, hoplitodromos, or, hoplite, race, introduced, in, 520, bc, and, traditionally, run, as, the, last, race, of, the, games, competitors, ran, either, a, single, or, double, diaulos, approximately, 400, or, 800, metres, 0, 25, or, 0, 5, miles, in, full, military, armour, the, hoplitodromos, was, based, on, a, war, tactic, of, soldiers, running, in, full, armor, to, surprise, the, enemy, wrestling, pale, is, recorded, as, being, introduced, at, the, 18th, olympiad, three, throws, were, necessary, for, a, win, a, throw, was, counted, if, the, body, hip, back, or, shoulder, and, possibly, knee, touched, the, ground, if, both, competitors, fell, nothing, was, counted, unlike, its, modern, counterpart, greco, roman, wrestling, it, is, likely, that, tripping, was, allowed, boxing, pygmachia, was, first, listed, in, 688, bc, the, boys, event, sixty, years, later, the, laws, of, boxing, were, ascribed, to, the, first, olympic, champion, onomastus, of, smyrna, it, appears, that, body, blows, were, either, not, permitted, or, not, practised, the, spartans, who, claimed, to, have, invented, boxing, quickly, abandoned, it, and, did, not, take, part, in, boxing, competitions, at, first, the, boxers, wore, himantes, sing, himas, long, leather, strips, which, were, wrapped, around, their, hands, the, pankration, was, one, of, the, most, popular, sports, in, the, ancient, olympics, games, the, pankration, was, introduced, in, the, 33rd, olympiad, 648, bc, boys, pankration, became, an, olympic, event, in, 200, bc, in, the, 145th, olympiad, as, well, as, techniques, from, boxing, and, wrestling, athletes, also, used, kicks, locks, and, chokes, on, the, ground, although, the, only, prohibitions, were, against, biting, and, gouging, the, pankration, was, regarded, as, less, dangerous, than, boxing, it, was, one, of, the, most, popular, events, pindar, wrote, eight, odes, praising, victors, of, the, pankration, a, famous, event, in, the, sport, was, the, posthumous, victory, of, arrhichion, of, phigalia, who, expired, at, the, very, moment, when, his, opponent, acknowledged, himself, beaten, the, discus, diskos, event, was, similar, to, the, modern, competition, stone, and, iron, diskoi, have, been, found, although, the, most, commonly, used, material, appears, to, be, bronze, to, what, extent, the, diskos, was, standardized, is, unclear, but, the, most, common, weight, seems, to, be, 2, kg, 4, 4, lbs, size, with, a, diameter, of, approximately, 21, cm, 8, in, roughly, equivalent, to, the, modern, discus, in, the, long, jump, halma, competitors, swung, a, pair, of, weights, called, halteres, there, was, no, set, design, jumpers, tended, to, use, either, spherical, weights, made, of, stone, carved, to, fit, the, hand, or, longer, lead, weights, it, is, debated, whether, the, jump, was, performed, from, a, standing, start, or, after, a, run, up, in, his, analysis, of, the, event, based, on, vase, paintings, hugh, lee, concluded, that, there, was, probably, a, short, run, up, the, pentathlon, was, a, competition, made, up, of, five, events, running, long, jump, discus, throw, javelin, throw, and, wrestling, the, pentathlon, is, said, to, have, first, appeared, at, the, 18th, olympiad, in, 708, bc, the, competition, was, held, on, a, single, day, but, it, is, not, known, how, the, victor, was, decided, or, in, what, order, the, events, occurred, except, that, it, finished, with, the, wrestling, horse, racing, and, chariot, racing, were, the, most, prestigious, competitions, in, the, games, due, to, only, the, wealthy, being, able, to, afford, the, maintenance, and, transportation, of, horses, these, races, consisted, of, different, events, the, four, horse, chariot, race, the, two, horse, chariot, race, and, the, horse, with, rider, race, the, rider, being, hand, picked, by, the, owner, the, four, horse, chariot, race, was, the, first, equestrian, event, to, feature, in, the, olympics, being, introduced, in, 680, bc, it, consisted, of, two, horses, that, were, harnessed, under, a, yoke, in, the, middle, and, two, outer, horses, that, were, attached, with, a, rope, the, two, horse, chariot, was, introduced, in, 408, bc, the, horse, with, rider, competition, on, the, other, hand, was, introduced, in, 648, bc, in, this, race, greeks, did, not, use, saddles, or, stirrups, the, latter, was, unknown, in, europe, until, about, the, 6th, century, ad, so, they, required, good, grip, and, balance, pausanias, reports, that, a, race, for, carts, drawn, by, a, pair, of, mules, and, a, trotting, race, were, instituted, respectively, at, the, seventieth, festival, and, the, seventy, first, but, were, both, abolished, by, proclamation, at, the, eighty, fourth, the, trotting, race, was, for,

trainer, and, spartan, princess, cynisca, to, be, the, first, female, olympic, victor, due, to, the, winner, being, the, benefactor, it, was, also, possible, for, a, particularly, wealthy, person, to,
