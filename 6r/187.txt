parenting, or, child, rearing, promotes, and, supports, the, physical, cognitive, social, emotional, and, educational, development, from, infancy, to, adulthood, parenting, refers, to, the, intricacies, of, raising, a, child, and, not, exclusively, for, a, biological, relationship, the, most, common, caretakers, in, parenting, are, the, biological, parents, of, the, child, in, question, however, a, caretaker, may, be, an, older, sibling, step, parent, grandparent, legal, guardian, aunt, uncle, other, family, members, or, a, family, friend, governments, and, society, may, also, have, a, role, in, child, rearing, or, upbringing, in, many, cases, orphaned, or, abandoned, children, receive, parental, care, from, non, parent, or, non, blood, relations, others, may, be, adopted, raised, in, foster, care, or, placed, in, an, orphanage, parenting, skills, vary, and, a, parent, or, surrogate, with, good, parenting, skills, may, be, referred, to, as, a, good, parent, parenting, styles, vary, by, historical, period, race, ethnicity, social, class, preference, and, a, few, other, social, features, additionally, research, supports, that, parental, history, both, in, terms, of, attachments, of, varying, quality, and, parental, psychopathology, particularly, in, the, wake, of, adverse, experiences, can, strongly, influence, parental, sensitivity, and, child, outcomes, parenting, may, have, long, term, impacts, on, adoptive, children, as, well, as, recent, research, has, shown, that, warm, adoptive, parenting, reduces, internalizing, and, externalizing, problems, of, the, adoptive, children, over, time, social, class, wealth, culture, and, income, have, a, very, strong, impact, on, what, methods, of, child, rearing, parents, use, cultural, values, play, a, major, role, in, how, a, parent, raises, their, child, however, parenting, is, always, evolving, as, times, cultural, practices, social, norms, and, traditions, change, studies, on, these, factors, affecting, parenting, decisions, have, shown, just, that, in, psychology, the, parental, investment, theory, suggests, that, basic, differences, between, males, and, females, in, parental, investment, have, great, adaptive, significance, and, lead, to, gender, differences, in, mating, propensities, and, preferences, a, parenting, style, is, indicative, of, the, overall, emotional, climate, in, the, home, developmental, psychologist, diana, baumrind, proposed, three, main, parenting, styles, in, early, child, development, authoritative, authoritarian, and, permissive, these, parenting, styles, were, later, expanded, to, four, to, include, an, uninvolved, style, these, four, styles, involve, combinations, of, acceptance, and, responsiveness, and, also, involve, demand, and, control, research, has, found, that, parenting, style, is, significantly, related, to, a, child, s, subsequent, mental, health, and, well, being, in, particular, authoritative, parenting, is, positively, related, to, mental, health, and, satisfaction, with, life, and, authoritarian, parenting, is, negatively, related, to, these, variables, with, authoritarian, and, permissive, parenting, on, opposite, sides, of, the, spectrum, most, conventional, modern, models, of, parenting, fall, somewhere, in, between, although, it, is, influential, baumrind, s, typology, has, received, significant, criticism, for, containing, overly, broad, categorizations, and, an, imprecise, and, overly, idealized, description, of, authoritative, parenting, described, by, baumrind, as, the, just, right, style, it, combines, medium, level, demands, on, the, child, and, a, medium, level, responsiveness, from, the, parents, authoritative, parents, rely, on, positive, reinforcement, and, infrequent, use, of, punishment, parents, are, more, aware, of, a, child, s, feelings, and, capabilities, and, support, the, development, of, a, child, s, autonomy, within, reasonable, limits, there, is, a, give, and, take, atmosphere, involved, in, parent, child, communication, and, both, control, and, support, are, balanced, some, research, has, shown, that, this, style, of, parenting, is, more, beneficial, than, the, too, hard, authoritarian, style, or, the, too, soft, permissive, style, these, children, score, higher, in, terms, of, competence, mental, health, and, social, development, than, those, raised, in, permissive, authoritarian, or, neglectful, homes, however, dr, wendy, grolnick, has, critiqued, baumrind, s, use, of, the, term, firm, control, in, her, description, of, authoritative, parenting, and, argued, that, there, should, be, clear, differentiation, between, coercive, power, assertion, which, is, associated, with, negative, effects, on, children, and, the, more, positive, practices, of, structure, and, high, expectations, authoritarian, parents, are, very, rigid, and, strict, high, demands, are, placed, on, the, child, but, there, is, little, responsiveness, to, them, parents, who, practice, authoritarian, style, parenting, have, a, non, negotiable, set, of, rules, and, expectations, strictly, enforced, and, require, rigid, obedience, when, the, rules, are, not, followed, punishment, is, often, used, to, promote, and, ensure, future, compliance, there, is, usually, no, explanation, of, punishment, except, that, the, child, is, in, trouble, for, breaking, a, rule, this, parenting, style, is, strongly, associated, with, corporal, punishment, such, as, spanking, this, type, of, parenting, seems, to, be, seen, more, often, in, working, class, families, than, in, the, middle, class, in, 1983, diana, baumrind, found, that, children, raised, in, an, authoritarian, style, home, were, less, cheerful, moodier, and, more, vulnerable, to, stress, in, many, cases, these, children, also, demonstrated, passive, hostility, this, parenting, style, can, negatively, impact, the, educational, success, and, career, path, while, a, firm, and, reassuring, parenting, style, impact, positively, permissive, parenting, has, become, a, more, popular, parenting, method, for, middle, class, families, than, working, class, families, roughly, since, the, end, of, wwii, in, these, settings, a, child, s, freedom, and, autonomy, are, highly, valued, and, parents, rely, primarily, on, reasoning, and, explanation, parents, are, undemanding, and, thus, there, tends, to, be, little, if, any, punishment, or, explicit, rules, in, this, parenting, style, these, parents, say, that, their, children, are, free, from, external, constraints, and, tend, to, be, highly, responsive, to, whatever, it, is, that, the, child, wants, children, of, permissive, parents, are, generally, happy, but, sometimes, show, low, levels, of, self, control, and, self, reliance, because, they, lack, structure, at, home, author, alfie, kohn, criticized, the, study, and, categorization, of, permissive, parenting, arguing, that, it, serves, to, blur, the, differences, between, permissive, parents, who, were, really, just, confused, and, those, who, were, deliberately, democratic, an, uninvolved, or, neglectful, parenting, style, is, when, parents, are, often, emotionally, or, physically, absent, they, have, little, to, no, expectations, from, the, child, and, regularly, have, no, communication, they, are, not, responsive, to, a, child, s, needs, and, have, little, to, no, behavioral, expectations, they, may, consider, their, children, to, be, emotionally, priceless, and, may, not, engage, with, them, and, believe, they, are, giving, the, child, its, personal, space, if, present, they, may, provide, what, the, child, needs, for, survival, with, little, to, no, engagement, there, is, often, a, large, gap, between, parents, and, children, with, this, parenting, style, children, with, little, or, no, communication, with, their, own, parents, tend, to, be, victimized, by, other, children, and, may, exhibit, deviant, behavior, themselves, children, of, uninvolved, parents, suffer, in, social, competence, academic, performance, psychosocial, development, and, problematic, behavior, intrusive, parenting, is, when, parents, use, parental, control, and, inhibition, of, adolescents, thoughts, feelings, and, emotional, expression, through, the, use, of, love, withdrawal, guilt, induction, and, manipulative, tactics, for, protecting, them, from, the, possible, pitfalls, without, knowing, it, can, deprive, disturb, the, adolescents, development, and, growth, period, intrusive, parents, may, try, to, set, unrealistic, expectations, on, their, children, by, overestimating, their, intellectual, capability, and, underestimating, their, physical, capability, or, developmental, capability, like, enrolling, them, into, more, extracurricular, activities, or, enrolling, them, into, certain, classes, without, understanding, their, child, s, passion, and, it, may, eventually, lead, children, not, taking, ownership, of, activities, or, develop, behavioral, problems, children, especially, adolescents, might, become, victims, and, be, unassertive, avoid, confrontation, being, eager, to, please, others, and, suffer, from, low, self, esteem, they, may, compare, their, children, to, others, like, friends, and, family, and, also, force, their, child, to, be, codependent, to, a, point, where, the, children, feel, unprepared, when, they, go, into, the, world, research, has, shown, that, this, parenting, style, can, lead, to, greater, under, eating, behaviors, risky, cyber, behaviors, substance, use, and, depressive, symptoms, among, adolescents, unconditional, parenting, refers, to, a, parenting, approach, that, is, focused, on, the, whole, child, emphasizes, working, with, a, child, to, solve, problems, and, views, parental, love, as, a, gift, it, contrasts, with, conditional, parenting, which, focuses, on, the, child, s, behavior, emphasizes, controlling, children, using, rewards, and, punishments, and, views, parental, love, as, a, privilege, to, be, earned, the, concept, of, unconditional, parenting, was, popularized, by, author, alfie, kohn, in, his, 2005, book, unconditional, parenting, moving, from, rewards, and, punishments, to, love, and, reason, kohn, differentiates, unconditional, parenting, from, what, he, sees, as, the, caricature, of, permissive, parenting, by, arguing, that, parents, can, be, anti, authoritarian, and, opposed, to, exerting, control, while, also, recognizing, the, value, of, respectful, adult, guidance, and, a, child, s, need, for, non, coercive, structure, in, their, lives, trustful, parenting, is, a, child, centered, parenting, style, in, which, parents, trust, their, children, to, make, decisions, play, and, explore, on, their, own, and, learn, from, their, own, mistakes, research, professor, peter, gray, argues, that, trustful, parenting, was, the, dominant, parenting, style, in, prehistoric, hunter, gatherer, societies, gray, contrasts, trustful, parenting, with, directive, domineering, parenting, which, emphasizes, controlling, children, to, train, them, in, obedience, historically, involving, using, child, labor, to, teach, subservience, to, lords, and, masters, and, directive, protective, parenting, which, involves, controlling, children, to, protect, them, from, harm, gray, argues, that, the, directive, domineering, approach, became, the, predominant, parenting, style, with, the, spread, of, agriculture, and, industry, while, the, directive, protective, approach, took, over, as, the, dominant, approach, in, the, late, 20th, century, a, parenting, practice, is, a, specific, behavior, that, a, parent, uses, in, raising, a, child, these, practices, are, used, to, socialize, children, kuppens, et, al, found, that, researchers, have, identified, overarching, parenting, dimensions, that, reflect, similar, parenting, practices, mostly, by, modeling, the, relationships, among, these, parenting, practices, using, factor, analytic, techniques, for, example, many, parents, read, aloud, to, their, offspring, in, the, hopes, of, supporting, their, linguistic, and, intellectual, development, in, cultures, with, strong, oral, traditions, such, as, indigenous, american, communities, and, new, zealand, maori, communities, storytelling, is, a, critical, parenting, practice, for, children, parenting, practices, reflect, the, cultural, understanding, of, children, parents, in, individualistic, countries, like, germany, spend, more, time, engaged, in, face, to, face, interaction, with, babies, and, more, time, talking, to, the, baby, about, the, baby, parents, in, more, communal, cultures, such, as, west, african, cultures, spend, more, time, talking, to, the, baby, about, other, people, and, more, time, with, the, baby, facing, outwards, so, that, the, baby, sees, what, the, mother, sees, parenting, skills, and, behaviors, assist, parents, in, leading, children, into, healthy, adulthood, and, development, of, the, child, s, social, skills, the, cognitive, potential, social, skills, and, behavioral, functioning, a, child, acquires, during, the, early, years, are, positively, correlated, with, the, quality, of, their, interactions, with, their, parents, according, to, the, canadian, council, on, learning, children, benefit, or, avoid, poor, developmental, outcomes, when, their, parents, parenting, skills, are, widely, thought, to, be, naturally, present, in, parents, however, there, is, substantial, evidence, to, the, contrary, those, who, come, from, a, negative, or, vulnerable, childhood, environment, frequently, and, often, unintentionally, mimic, their, parents, behavior, during, interactions, with, their, own, children, parents, with, an, inadequate, understanding, of, developmental, milestones, may, also, demonstrate, problematic, parenting, parenting, practices, are, of, particular, importance, during, marital, transitions, like, separation, divorce, and, remarriage, if, children, fail, to, adequately, adjust, to, these, changes, they, are, at, risk, of, negative, outcomes, e, g, increased, rule, breaking, behavior, problems, with, peer, relationships, and, increased, emotional, difficulties, research, classifies, competence, and, skills, required, in, parenting, as, follows, consistency, is, considered, the, backbone, of, positive, parenting, skills, and, overprotection, the, weakness, the, arbinger, institute, adds, to, these, skills, and, methods, of, parenting, with, what, the, authors, of, the, parenting, pyramid, claims, are, methods, to, parent, for, things, to, go, right, or, in, other, words, steps, that, should, be, taken, to, ensure, good, positive, relationships, are, occurring, in, the, home, which, can, help, children, be, more, willing, to, listen, their, methods, are, described, as, the, parenting, pyramid, the, parenting, pyramid, starting, at, the, foundational, level, and, working, up, to, the, top, believing, that, as, parents, are, focused, on, this, order, of, establishing, their, homes, and, parenting, styles, then, if, a, parent, has, to, encourage, different, behaviors, from, children, this, correction, will, come, from, a, better, place, and, therefore, the, children, may, be, more, receptive, to, such, feedback, compared, to, if, a, parent, attempts, to, correct, behaviors, before, focusing, on, the, previous, steps, parent, psychosocial, health, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, parent, child, relationship, group, based, parent, training, and, education, programs, have, proven, to, be, effective, at, improving, short, term, psychosocial, well, being, for, parents, there, are, many, different, types, of, training, parents, can, take, to, support, their, parenting, skills, some, groups, include, parent, child, interaction, therapy, pcit, parents, management, training, pmt, positive, parenting, program, triple, p, the, incredible, years, and, behavioral, and, emotional, skills, training, best, pcit, works, with, both, parents, and, children, in, teaching, skills, to, interact, more, positively, and, productive, pmt, is, focused, for,

parents, with, the, information, they, need, to, increase, confidence, and, self, sufficiency, in, managing, their, children, s, behavior, the, incredible, years, focuses, in, age, infancy, age, 12, in, which, they, are, broken, into, small, group, based, training, in, different, areas, best, introduces, effective, behavior, management, techniques, in, one, day, rather, than, over, the, course, of, a, few, weeks, courses, are, offered, to, families, based, on, effective, training, to, support, additional, needs, behavioral, guidelines, communication, and, many, others, to, give, guidance, throughout, learning, how, to, be, a, parent, parents, around, the, world, want, what, they, believe, is, best, for, their, children, however, parents, in, different, cultures, have, different, ideas, of, what, is, best, for, example, parents, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, or, those, who, survive, through, subsistence, agriculture, are, likely, to, promote, practical, survival, skills, from, a, young, age, many, such, cultures, begin, teaching, children, to, use, sharp, tools, including, knives, before, their, first, birthdays, in, some, indigenous, american, communities, child, work, provides, children, the, opportunity, to, absorb, cultural, values, of, collaborative, participation, and, prosocial, behavior, through, observation, and, activity, alongside, adults, these, communities, value, respect, participation, and, non, interference, the, cherokee, principle, of, respecting, autonomy, by, withholding, unsolicited, advice, indigenous, american, parents, also, try, to, encourage, curiosity, in, their, children, via, a, permissive, parenting, style, that, enables, them, to, explore, and, learn, through, observation, of, the, world, differences, in, cultural, values, cause, parents, to, interpret, the, same, behaviors, in, different, ways, for, instance, european, americans, prize, intellectual, understanding, especially, in, a, narrow, book, learning, sense, and, believe, that, asking, questions, is, a, sign, of, intelligence, italian, parents, value, social, and, emotional, competence, and, believe, that, curiosity, demonstrates, good, interpersonal, skills, dutch, parents, however, value, independence, long, attention, spans, and, predictability, in, their, eyes, asking, questions, is, a, negative, behavior, signifying, a, lack, of, independence, even, so, parents, around, the, world, share, specific, prosocial, behavioral, goals, for, their, children, hispanic, parents, value, respect, and, emphasize, putting, family, above, the, individual, parents, in, east, asia, prize, order, in, the, household, above, all, else, in, some, cases, this, gives, rise, to, high, levels, of, psychological, control, and, even, manipulation, on, the, part, of, the, head, of, the, household, the, kipsigis, people, of, kenya, value, children, who, are, innovative, and, wield, that, intelligence, responsibly, and, helpfully, a, behavior, they, call, ng, om, other, cultures, such, as, in, sweden, and, spain, value, sociality, and, happiness, as, well, it, is, common, for, parents, in, many, indigenous, american, communities, to, use, different, parenting, tools, such, as, storytelling, like, myths, consejos, spanish, for, advice, educational, teasing, nonverbal, communication, and, observational, learning, to, teach, their, children, important, values, and, life, lessons, storytelling, is, a, way, for, indigenous, american, children, to, learn, about, their, identity, community, and, cultural, history, indigenous, myths, and, folklore, often, personify, animals, and, objects, reaffirming, the, belief, that, everything, possesses, a, soul, and, deserves, respect, these, stories, also, help, preserve, the, language, and, are, used, to, reflect, certain, values, or, cultural, histories, the, consejo, is, a, narrative, form, of, advice, giving, rather, than, directly, telling, the, child, what, to, do, in, a, particular, situation, the, parent, might, instead, tell, a, story, about, a, similar, situation, the, main, character, in, the, story, is, intended, to, help, the, child, see, their, decision, s, implications, without, directly, deciding, for, them, this, teaches, the, child, to, be, decisive, and, independent, while, still, providing, some, guidance, the, playful, form, of, teasing, is, a, parenting, method, used, in, some, indigenous, american, communities, to, keep, children, out, of, danger, and, guide, their, behavior, this, parenting, strategy, uses, stories, fabrications, or, empty, threats, to, guide, children, in, making, safe, intelligent, decisions, for, example, a, parent, may, tell, a, child, that, there, is, a, monster, that, jumps, on, children, s, backs, if, they, walk, alone, at, night, this, explanation, can, help, keep, the, child, safe, because, instilling, that, fear, creates, greater, awareness, and, lessens, the, likelihood, that, they, will, wander, alone, into, trouble, in, navajo, families, a, child, s, development, is, partly, focused, on, the, importance, of, respect, for, all, things, respect, consists, of, recognizing, the, significance, of, one, s, relationship, with, other, things, and, people, in, the, world, children, largely, learn, about, this, concept, via, nonverbal, communication, between, parents, and, other, family, members, for, example, children, are, initiated, at, an, early, age, into, the, practice, of, an, early, morning, run, under, any, weather, conditions, on, this, run, the, community, uses, humor, and, laughter, with, each, other, without, directly, including, the, child, who, may, not, wish, to, get, up, early, and, run, to, encourage, the, child, to, participate, and, become, an, active, member, of, the, community, parents, also, promote, participation, in, the, morning, runs, by, placing, their, child, in, the, snow, and, having, them, stay, longer, if, they, protest, indigenous, american, parents, often, incorporate, children, into, everyday, life, including, adult, activities, allowing, the, child, to, learn, through, observation, this, practice, is, known, as, lopi, learning, by, observing, and, pitching, in, where, children, are, integrated, into, all, types, of, mature, daily, activities, and, encouraged, to, observe, and, contribute, in, the, community, this, inclusion, as, a, parenting, tool, promotes, both, community, participation, and, learning, one, notable, example, appears, in, some, mayan, communities, young, girls, are, not, permitted, around, the, hearth, for, an, extended, period, of, time, since, corn, is, sacred, although, this, is, an, exception, to, their, cultural, preference, for, incorporating, children, into, activities, including, cooking, it, is, a, strong, example, of, observational, learning, mayan, girls, can, only, watch, their, mothers, making, tortillas, for, a, few, minutes, at, a, time, but, the, sacredness, of, the, activity, captures, their, interest, they, will, then, go, and, practice, their, mother, s, movements, on, other, objects, such, as, kneading, thin, pieces, of, plastic, like, a, tortilla, from, this, practice, when, a, girl, comes, of, age, she, is, able, to, sit, down, and, make, tortillas, without, having, ever, received, any, explicit, verbal, instruction, however, in, many, cases, oppressive, circumstances, such, as, forced, conversion, land, loss, and, displacement, led, to, diminishment, of, traditional, native, american, parenting, techniques, due, to, the, increasing, racial, and, ethnic, diversity, in, the, united, states, ethnic, racial, socialization, research, has, gained, some, attention, parental, ethnic, racial, socialization, is, a, way, of, passing, down, cultural, resources, to, support, children, of, color, s, psychosocial, wellness, the, goals, of, ethnic, racial, socialization, are, to, pass, on, a, positive, view, of, one, s, ethnic, group, and, to, help, children, cope, with, racism, through, a, meta, analysis, of, published, research, on, ethnic, racial, socialization, ethnic, racial, socialization, positively, affects, psychosocial, well, being, this, meta, analytic, review, focuses, on, research, relevant, to, four, indicators, of, psychosocial, skills, and, how, they, are, influenced, by, developmental, stage, race, and, ethnicity, research, designs, and, the, differences, between, parent, and, child, self, reports, the, dimensions, of, ethnic, racial, socialization, that, are, considered, when, looking, for, correlations, with, psychosocial, skills, are, cultural, socialization, preparation, for, bias, promotion, of, mistrust, and, egalitarianism, ethnic, racial, socialization, dimensions, are, defined, as, follows, cultural, socialization, is, the, process, of, passing, down, cultural, customs, preparation, for, bias, ranges, from, positive, or, negative, reactions, to, racism, and, discrimination, promotion, of, mistrust, conditions, synergy, when, dealing, with, other, races, and, egalitarianism, puts, similarities, between, races, first, psychosocial, competencies, are, defined, as, follows, self,

observable, troublesome, behavior, and, internalizing, behavior, deals, with, emotional, intelligence, regulation, the, multiple, ways, these, domains, and, competencies, interact, show, small, correlations, between, ethnic, racial, socialization, and, psychosocial, wellness, but, this, parenting, practice, needs, further, research, this, meta, analysis, showed, that, developmental, stages, affect, how, children, perceived, ethnic, racial, socialization, cultural, socialization, practices, appear, to, affect, children, similarly, across, developmental, stages, except, for, preparation, for, bias, and, promotion, of, mistrust, which, are, encouraged, for, older, aged, children, existing, research, shows, ethnic, racial, socialization, serves, african, americans, positively, against, discrimination, cross, sectional, studies, were, predicted, to, have, greater, effect, sizes, because, correlations, are, inflated, in, these, kinds, of, studies, parental, reports, of, ethnic, racial, socialization, influence, are, influenced, by, intentions, so, child, reports, tend, to, be, more, accurate, among, other, conclusions, derived, from, this, meta, analysis, cultural, socialization, and, self, perceptions, had, a, small, positive, correlation, cultural, socialization, and, promotion, of, mistrust, had, a, small, negative, correlation, and, interpersonal, relationships, positively, impacted, cultural, socialization, and, preparation, for, bias, in, regard, to, developmental, stages, ethnic, racial, socialization, had, a, small, but, positive, correlation, with, self, perceptions, during, childhood, and, early, adolescence, based, on, study, designs, there, were, no, significant, differences, meaning, that, cross, sectional, studies, and, longitudinal, studies, both, showed, small, positive, correlations, between, ethnic, racial, socialization, and, self, perceptions, reporter, differences, between, parents, and, children, showed, positive, correlations, between, ethnic, racial, socialization, when, associated, with, internalizing, behavior, and, interpersonal, relationships, these, two, correlations, showed, a, greater, effect, size, with, child, reports, compared, to, parent, reports, the, meta, analysis, on, previous, research, shows, only, correlations, so, there, is, a, need, for, experimental, studies, that, can, show, causation, amongst, the, different, domains, and, dimensions, children, s, behavior, and, adaptation, to, this, behavior, may, indicate, a, bidirectional, effect, that, can, also, be, addressed, by, an, experimental, study, there, is, evidence, to, show, that, ethnic, racial, socialization, can, help, children, of, color, obtain, social, emotional, skills, that, can, help, them, navigate, through, racism, and, discrimination, but, further, research, needs, to, be, done, to, increase, the, generalizability, of, existing, research, family, planning, is, the, decision, making, process, surrounding, whether, to, become, parents, or, not, and, when, the, right, time, would, be, including, planning, preparing, and, gathering, resources, prospective, parents, may, assess, among, other, matters, whether, they, have, access, to, sufficient, financial, resources, whether, their, family, situation, is, stable, and, whether, they, want, to, undertake, the, responsibility, of, raising, a, child, worldwide, about, 40, of, all, pregnancies, are, not, planned, and, more, than, 30, million, babies, are, born, each, year, as, a, result, of, unplanned, pregnancies, reproductive, health, and, preconception, care, affect, pregnancy, reproductive, success, and, the, physical, and, mental, health, of, both, mother, and, child, a, woman, who, is, underweight,

by, themselves, at, this, stage, parents, are, heavily, involved, in, showing, the, small, child, how, to, do, things, rather, than, just, doing, things, for, them, it, is, normal, for, the, toddler, to, mimic, the, parents, toddlers, need, help, to, build, their, vocabulary, increase, their, communication, skills, and, manage, their, emotions, toddlers, will, also, begin, to, understand, social, etiquette, such, as, being, polite, and, taking, turns, toddlers, are, very, curious, about, the, world, around, them, and, are, eager, to, explore, it, they, seek, greater, independence, and, responsibility, and, may, become, frustrated, when, things, do, not, go, the, way, that, they, want, or, expect, tantrums, begin, at, this, stage, which, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, terrible, twos, tantrums, are, often, caused, by, the, child, s, frustration, over, the, particular, situation, and, are, sometimes, caused, simply, because, they, are, not, able, to, communicate, properly, parents, of, toddlers, are, expected, to, help, guide, and, teach, the, child, establish, basic, routines, such, as, washing, hands, before, meals, or, brushing, teeth, before, bed, and, increase, the, child, s, responsibilities, it, is, also, normal, for, toddlers, to, be, frequently, frustrated, it, is, an, essential, step, to, their, development, they, will, learn, through, experience, trial, and, error, this, means, that, they, need, to, experience, being, frustrated, when, something, does, not, work, for, them, in, order, to, move, on, to, the, next, stage, when, the, toddler, is, frustrated, they, will, often, misbehave, with, actions, like, screaming, hitting, or, biting, parents, need, to, be, careful, when, reacting, to, such, behaviors, giving, threats, or, punishments, is, usually, not, helpful, and, might, only, make, the, situation, worse, research, groups, led, by, daniel, schechter, alytia, levendosky, and, others, have, shown, that, parents, with, histories, of, maltreatment, and, violence, exposure, often, have, difficulty, helping, their, toddlers, and, preschool, age, children, with, the, very, same, emotionally, dysregulated, behaviors, which, can, remind, traumatized, parents, of, their, adverse, experiences, and, associated, mental, states, regarding, gender, differences, in, parenting, data, from, the, us, in, 2014, states, that, on, an, average, day, among, adults, living, in, households, with, children, under, age, 6, women, spent, 1, 0, hours, providing, physical, care, such, as, bathing, or, feeding, a, child, to, household, children, by, contrast, men, spent, 23, minutes, providing, physical, care, younger, children, start, to, become, more, independent, and, begin, to, build, friendships, they, are, able, to, reason, and, can, make, their, own, decisions, in, many, hypothetical, situations, young, children, demand, constant, attention, but, gradually, learn, how, to, deal, with, boredom, and, begin, to, be, able, to, play, independently, they, enjoy, helping, and, also, feeling, useful, and, capable, parents, can, assist, their, children, by, encouraging, social, interactions, and, modeling, proper, social, behaviors, a, large, part, of, learning, in, the, early, years, comes, from, being, involved, in, activities, and, household, duties, parents, who, observe, their, children, in, play, or, join, with, them, in, child, driven, play, have, the, opportunity, to, glimpse, into, their, children, s, world, learn, to, communicate, more, effectively, with, their, children, and, are, given, another, setting, to, offer, gentle, nurturing, guidance, parents, also, teach, their, children, health, hygiene, and, eating, habits, through, instruction, and, by, example, parents, are, expected, to, make, decisions, about, their, child, s, education, parenting, styles, in, this, area, diverge, greatly, at, this, stage, with, some, parents, they, choose, to, become, heavily, involved, in, arranging, organized, activities, and, early, learning, programs, other, parents, choose, to, let, the, child, develop, with, few, organized, activities, children, begin, to, learn, responsibility, and, consequences, for, their, actions, with, parental, assistance, some, parents, provide, a, small, allowance, that, increases, with, age, to, help, teach, children, the, value, of, money, and, how, to, be, responsible, parents, who, are, consistent, and, fair, with, their, discipline, who, openly, communicate, and, offer, explanations, to, their, children, and, who, do, not, neglect, the, needs, of, their, children, in, any, way, often, find, they, have, fewer, problems, with, their, children, as, they, mature, when, child, conduct, problems, are, encountered, behavioral, and, cognitive, behavioral, group, based, parenting, interventions, have, been, found, to, be, effective, at, improving, child, conduct, parenting, skills, and, parental, mental, health, parents, often, feel, isolated, and, alone, when, parenting, adolescents, adolescence, can, be, a, time, of, high, risk, for, children, where, newfound, freedoms, can, result, in, decisions, that, drastically, open, up, or, close, off, life, opportunities, there, are, also, large, changes, that, occur, in, the, brain, during, adolescence, the, emotional, center, of, the, brain, is, now, fully, developed, but, the, rational, frontal, cortex, has, not, matured, fully, and, still, is, not, able, to, keep, all, of, those, emotions, in, check, adolescents, tend, to, increase, the, amount, of, time, spent, with, peers, of, the, opposite, gender, however, they, still, maintain, the, amount, of, time, spent, with, those, of, the, same, gender, and, do, this, by, decreasing, the, amount, of, time, spent, with, their, parents, although, adolescents, look, to, peers, and, adults, outside, the, family, for, guidance, and, models, for, how, to, behave, parents, can, remain, influential, in, their, development, studies, have, shown, that, parents, can, have, a, significant, impact, for, instance, on, how, much, teens, drink, other, studies, show, that, parents, continued, presence, in, provides, stability, and, nurture, to, their, developing, adolescents, during, adolescence, children, begin, to, form, their, identity, and, start, to, test, and, develop, the, interpersonal, and, occupational, roles, that, they, will, assume, as, adults, therefore, it, is, important, that, parents, treat, them, as, young, adults, parental, issues, at, this, stage, of, parenting, include, dealing, with, rebelliousness, related, to, a, greater, desire, to, partake, in, risky, behaviors, in, order, to, prevent, risky, behaviors, it, is, important, for, the, parents, to, build, a, trusting, relationship, with, their, children, this, can, be, achieved, through, behavioral, control, parental, monitoring, consistent, discipline, parental, warmth, and, support, inductive, reasoning, and, strong, parent, child, communication, when, a, trusting, relationship, is, built, up, adolescents, are, more, likely, to, approach, their, parents, for, help, when, faced, with, negative, peer, pressure, helping, children, build, a, strong, foundation, will, ultimately, help, them, resist, negative, peer, pressure, not, only, will, a, positive, relationship, between, adolescent, and, parent, benefit, when, faced, with, peer, pressure, it, will, help, with, identity, processing, in, early, adolescents, research, by, berzonsky, et, al, found, that, adolescents, that, were, open, and, trusting, of, their, parents, were, given, more, freedom, and, their, parents, were, less, likely, to, track, them, and, control, their, behavior, parenting, does, not, usually, end, when, a, child, turns, 18, support, may, be, needed, in, a, child, s, life, well, beyond, the, adolescent, years, and, can, continue, into, middle, and, later, adulthood, parenting, can, be, a, lifelong, process, parents, may, provide, financial, support, to, their, adult, children, which, can, also, include, providing, an, inheritance, after, death, the, life, perspective, and, wisdom, given, by, a, parent, can, benefit, their, adult, children, in, their, own, lives, becoming, a, grandparent, is, another, milestone, and, has, many, similarities, with, parenting, roles, can, be, reversed, in, some, ways, when, adult, children, become, caregivers, to, their, elderly, parents, parents, may, receive, assistance, with, caring, for, their, children, through, child, care, programs, article, 25, 2, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, declares, that, motherhood, and, childhood, are, entitled, to, special, care, and, assistance, all, children, whether, born, in, or, out, of, wedlock, shall, enjoy, the, same, social, protection, data, from, the, british, household, panel, survey, and, the, german, socio, economic, panel, suggests, that, having, up, to, two, children, increases, happiness, in, the, years, around, the, birth, and, mostly, only, for, those, who, have, postponed, childbearing, however, having, a, third, child, is, not, shown, to, increase, happiness, data, from, a, private, opinion, american, survey, called, success, index, suggests, that, parenting, is, deemed, important, for, people, especially, for, those, aged, 65, and, older, as, compared, to, those, aged, 18, to, 35, according, to, the, survey, being, a, parent, is, now, an, integral, part, of, the, new, american, dream
