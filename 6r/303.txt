checkers, american, english, also, known, as, draughts, d, r, f, t, s, d, r, f, t, s, british, english, is, a, group, of, strategy, board, games, for, two, players, which, involve, forward, movements, of, uniform, game, pieces, and, mandatory, captures, by, jumping, over, opponent, pieces, checkers, is, developed, from, alquerque, the, term, checkers, derives, from, the, checkered, board, which, the, game, is, played, on, whereas, draughts, derives, from, the, verb, to, draw, or, to, move, the, most, popular, forms, of, checkers, in, anglophone, countries, are, american, checkers, also, called, english, draughts, which, is, played, on, an, 8, 8, checkerboard, russian, draughts, and, turkish, draughts, both, on, an, 8x8, board, and, international, draughts, played, on, a, 10, 10, board, with, the, latter, widely, played, in, many, countries, worldwide, there, are, many, other, variants, played, on, 8, 8, boards, canadian, checkers, and, malaysian, singaporean, checkers, also, locally, known, as, dam, are, played, on, a, 12, 12, board, american, checkers, was, weakly, solved, in, 2007, by, a, team, of, canadian, computer, scientists, led, by, jonathan, schaeffer, from, the, standard, starting, position, perfect, play, by, each, side, would, result, in, a, draw, checkers, is, played, by, two, opponents, on, opposite, sides, of, the, game, board, one, player, has, dark, pieces, usually, black, the, other, has, light, pieces, usually, white, or, red, the, darker, color, moves, first, then, players, alternate, turns, a, player, cannot, move, the, opponent, s, pieces, a, move, consists, of, moving, a, piece, forward, to, an, adjacent, unoccupied, square, if, the, adjacent, square, contains, an, opponent, s, piece, and, the, square, immediately, beyond, it, is, vacant, the, piece, may, be, captured, and, removed, from, the, game, by, jumping, over, it, only, the, dark, squares, of, the, checkerboard, are, used, a, piece, can, only, move, forward, into, an, unoccupied, square, when, capturing, an, opponent, s, piece, is, possible, capturing, is, mandatory, in, most, official, rules, if, the, player, does, not, capture, the, other, player, can, remove, the, opponent, s, piece, as, a, penalty, or, muffin, and, where, there, are, two, or, more, such, positions, the, player, forfeits, pieces, that, cannot, be, moved, although, some, rule, variations, make, capturing, optional, in, almost, all, variants, a, player, with, no, valid, move, remaining, loses, this, occurs, if, the, player, has, no, pieces, left, or, if, all, the, player, s, pieces, are, obstructed, from, moving, by, opponent, pieces, an, uncrowned, piece, man, moves, one, step, ahead, and, captures, an, adjacent, opponent, s, piece, by, jumping, over, it, and, landing, on, the, next, square, multiple, enemy, pieces, can, be, captured, in, a, single, turn, provided, this, is, done, by, successive, jumps, made, by, a, single, piece, the, jumps, do, not, need, to, be, in, the, same, line, and, may, zigzag, change, diagonal, direction, in, american, checkers, men, can, jump, only, forwards, in, international, draughts, and, russian, draughts, men, can, jump, both, forwards, and, backwards, when, a, man, reaches, the, farthest, row, forward, known, as, the, kings, row, or, crown, head, it, becomes, a, king, it, is, marked, by, placing, an, additional, piece, on, top, of, or, crowning, the, first, man, the, king, has, additional, powers, namely, the, ability, to, move, any, amount, of, squares, at, a, time, in, international, checkers, move, backwards, and, in, variants, where, men, cannot, already, do, so, capture, backwards, like, a, man, a, king, can, make, successive, jumps, in, a, single, turn, provided, that, each, jump, captures, an, enemy, piece, in, international, draughts, kings, also, called, flying, kings, move, any, distance, they, may, capture, an, opposing, man, any, distance, away, by, jumping, to, any, of, the, unoccupied, squares, immediately, beyond, it, because, jumped, pieces, remain, on, the, board, until, the, turn, is, complete, it, is, possible, to, reach, a, position, in, a, multi, jump, move, where, the, flying, king, is, blocked, from, capturing, further, by, a, piece, already, jumped, flying, kings, are, not, used, in, american, checkers, a, king, s, only, advantage, over, a, man, is, the, additional, ability, to, move, and, capture, backwards, in, most, non, english, languages, except, those, that, acquired, the, game, from, english, speakers, checkers, is, called, dame, dames, damas, or, a, similar, term, that, refers, to, ladies, the, pieces, are, usually, called, men, stones, pe, n, pawn, or, a, similar, term, men, promoted, to, kings, are, called, dames, or, ladies, in, these, languages, the, queen, in, chess, or, in, card, games, is, usually, called, by, the, same, term, as, the, kings, in, checkers, a, case, in, point, includes, the, greek, terminology, in, which, checkers, is, called, dama, which, is, also, one, term, for, the, queen, in, chess, similar, games, have, been, played, for, millennia, a, board, resembling, a, checkers, board, was, found, in, ur, dating, from, 3000, bc, in, the, british, museum, are, specimens, of, ancient, egyptian, checkerboards, found, with, their, pieces, in, burial, chambers, and, the, game, was, played, by, the, pharaoh, hatshepsut, plato, mentioned, a, game, or, petteia, as, being, of, egyptian, origin, and, homer, also, mentions, it, the, method, of, capture, was, placing, two, pieces, on, either, side, of, the, opponent, s, piece, it, was, said, to, have, been, played, during, the, trojan, war, the, romans, played, a, derivation, of, petteia, called, latrunculi, or, the, game, of, the, little, soldiers, the, pieces, and, sporadically, the, game, itself, were, called, calculi, pebbles, like, the, pawn, in, chess, alquerque, was, probably, derived, from, and, latrunculi, by, removing, the, necessity, for, two, pieces, to, cooperate, to, capture, one, although, like, ghanaian, draughts, the, game, could, still, be, declared, lost, by, a, player, with, only, one, piece, left, an, arabic, game, called, quirkat, or, al, qirq, with, similar, play, to, modern, checkers, was, played, on, a, 5, 5, board, it, is, mentioned, in, the, tenth, century, work, kitab, al, aghani, al, qirq, was, also, the, name, for, the, game, that, is, now, called, nine, men, s, morris, al, qirq, was, brought, to, spain, by, the, moors, where, it, became, known, as, alquerque, the, spanish, derivation, of, the, arabic, name, it, was, maybe, adapted, into, a, derivation, of, latrunculi, or, the, game, of, the, little, soldiers, with, a, leaping, capture, which, like, modern, argentine, german, greek, and, thai, draughts, had, flying, kings, which, had, to, stop, on, the, next, square, after, the, captured, piece, but, pieces, could, only, make, up, to, three, captures, at, once, or, seven, if, all, directions, were, legal, that, said, even, if, playing, al, qirq, inside, the, cells, of, a, square, grid, was, not, already, known, to, the, moors, who, brought, it, which, it, probably, was, either, via, playing, on, a, chessboard, in, about, 1100, probably, in, the, south, of, france, this, was, done, once, again, using, backgammon, pieces, thereby, each, piece, was, called, a, fers, the, same, name, as, the, chess, queen, as, the, move, of, the, two, pieces, was, the, same, at, the, time, or, adapting, seega, using, jumping, capture, the, rules, are, given, in, the, 13th, century, book, libro, de, los, juegos, the, rule, of, crowning, was, used, by, the, 13th, century, as, it, is, mentioned, in, the, philippe, mousk, s, s, chronique, in, 1243, when, the, game, was, known, as, fierges, the, name, used, for, the, chess, queen, derived, from, the, persian, ferz, meaning, royal, counsellor, or, vizier, the, pieces, became, known, as, dames, when, that, name, was, also, adopted, for, the, chess, queen, the, rule, forcing, players, to, take, whenever, possible, was, introduced, in, france, in, around, 1535, at, which, point, the, game, became, known, as, jeu, forc, identical, to, modern, american, checkers, the, game, without, forced, capture, became, known, as, le, jeu, plaisant, de, dames, the, precursor, of, international, checkers, the, 18th, century, english, author, samuel, johnson, wrote, a, foreword, to, a, 1756, book, about, checkers, by, william, payne, the, earliest, book, in, english, about, the, game, american, checkers, english, draughts, has, been, the, arena, for, several, notable, advances, in, game, artificial, intelligence, in, 1951, christopher, strachey, wrote, the, first, video, game, program, on, checkers, the, checkers, program, tried, to, run, for, the, first, time, on, 30, july, 1951, at, npl, but, was, unsuccessful, due, to, program, errors, in, the, summer, of, 1952, he, successfully, ran, the, program, on, ferranti, mark, 1, computer, and, played, the, first, computer, checkers, and, arguably, the, first, video, game, ever, according, to, certain, definitions, in, the, 1950s, arthur, samuel, created, one, of, the, first, board, game, playing, programs, of, any, kind, more, recently, in, 2007, scientists, at, the, university, of, alberta, developed, their, chinook, program, to, the, point, where, it, is, unbeatable, a, brute, force, approach, that, took, hundreds, of, computers, working, nearly, two, decades, was, used, to, solve, the, game, showing, that, a, game, of, checkers, will, always, end, in, a, draw, if, neither, player, makes, a, mistake, the, solution, is, for, the, checkers, variation, called, go, as, you, please, gayp, checkers, and, not, for, the, variation, called, three, move, restriction, checkers, however, it, is, a, legal, three, move, restriction, game, because, only, openings, believed, to, lose, are, barred, under, the, three, move, restriction, as, of, december, 2007, this, makes, american, checkers, the, most, complex, game, ever, solved, in, november, 1983, the, science, museum, oklahoma, then, called, the, omniplex, unveiled, a, new, exhibit, lefty, the, checker, playing, robot, programmed, by, scott, m, savage, lefty, used, an, armdroid, robotic, arm, by, colne, robotics, and, was, powered, by, a, 6502, processor, with, a, combination, of, basic, and, assembly, code, to, interactively, play, a, round, of, checkers, with, visitors, to, the, museum, originally, the, program, was, deliberately, simple, so, that, the, average, museum, visitor, could, potentially, win, but, over, time, was, improved, the, improvements, however, proved, to, be, more, frustrating, for, the, visitors, so, the, original, code, was, reimplemented, generalized, checkers, is, played, on, an, m, n, board, it, is, pspace, hard, to, determine, whether, a, specified, player, has, a, winning, strategy, and, if, a, polynomial, bound, is, placed, on, the, number, of, moves, that, are, allowed, in, between, jumps, which, is, a, reasonable, generalisation, of, the, drawing, rule, in, standard, checkers, then, the, problem, is, in, pspace, thus, it, is, pspace, complete, however, without, this, bound, checkers, is, exptime, complete, however, other, problems, have, only, polynomial, complexity, in, an, ending, with, three, kings, versus, one, king, the, player, with, three, kings, must, win, in, thirteen, moves, or, the, game, is, a, draw, in, an, ending, with, three, kings, versus, one, king, the, player, with, three, kings, must, win, in, thirteen, moves, or, the, game, is, a, draw, there, is, also, a, 10, 8, board, variant, with, two, additional, columns, labelled, i, and, k, and, the, give, away, variant, poddavki, there, are, official, championships, for, shashki, and, its, variants, 10x10, 15, with, this, rule, there, is, no, draw, with, two, kings, versus, one, it, is, played, in, turkey, kuwait, israel, lebanon, syria, jordan, greece, and, several, other, locations, in, the, middle, east, as, well, as, in, the, same, locations, as, russian, checkers, there, are, several, variants, in, these, countries, with, the, armenian, variant, called, tama, allowing, also, forward, diagonal, movement, of, men, and, the, greek, requiring, the, king, to, stop, directly, after, the, captured, piece, with, this, rule, there, is, no, draw, with, one, king, and, men, versus, one, king, column, draughts, russian, towers, also, known, as, bashni, is, a, kind, of, draughts, known, in, russia, since, the, beginning, of, the, nineteenth, century, in, which, the, game, is, played, according, to, the, usual, rules, of, russian, draughts, but, with, the, difference, that, the, captured, man, is, not, removed, from, the, playing, field, rather, it, is, placed, under, the, capturing, piece, man, or, tower, the, resulting, towers, move, around, the, board, as, a, whole, obeying, the, upper, piece, when, taking, a, tower, only, the, uppermost, piece, is, removed, from, it, and, the, resulting, tower, belongs, to, one, player, or, the, other, according, to, the, color, of, its, new, uppermost, piece, bashni, has, inspired, the, games, lasca, and, emergo, draughts, associations, and, federations, history, articles, variants, rules, online, play
