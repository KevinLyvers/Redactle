the, ten, years, following, 1993, than, in, the, preceding, 700, years, combined, during, his, reign, atop, the, sport, in, the, late, 1990s, he, was, the, prototype, he, could, strike, with, the,

mma, promotions, such, as, ufc, and, pride, has, fostered, an, accelerated, development, of, the, sport, the, early, 1990s, saw, a, wide, variety, of, traditional, styles, competing, in, the, sport, however, early, competition, saw, varying, levels, of, success, among, disparate, styles, in, the, early, 1990s, practitioners, of, grappling, based, styles, such, as, brazilian, jiu, jitsu, dominated, competition, in, the, united, states, practitioners, of, striking, based, arts, such, as, boxing, kickboxing, and, karate, who, were, unfamiliar, with, submission, grappling, proved, to, be, unprepared, to, deal, with, its, submission, techniques, as, competitions, became, more, and, more, common, those, with, a, base, in, striking, arts, became, more, competitive, as, they, cross, trained, in, styles, based, around, takedowns, and, submission, holds, likewise, those, from, the, varying, grappling, styles, added, striking, techniques, to, their, arsenal, this, increase, of, cross, training, resulted, in, fighters, becoming, increasingly, multidimensional, and, well, rounded, in, their, skill, sets, the, new, hybridization, of, fighting, styles, can, be, seen, in, the, technique, of, ground, and, pound, developed, by, wrestling, based, ufc, pioneers, such, as, dan, severn, don, frye, and, mark, coleman, these, wrestlers, realized, the, need, for, the, incorporation, of, strikes, on, the, ground, as, well, as, on, the, feet, and, incorporated, ground, striking, into, their, grappling, based, styles, mark, coleman, stated, at, ufc, 14, that, his, strategy, was, to,

rare, to, see, any, fighter, who, is, not, schooled, in, both, striking, and, grappling, arts, reach, the, highest, levels, of, competition, the, greatest, mma, fighter, of, all, time, is, considered,

that, the, original, minimalist, rule, systems, needed, to, be, amended, the, main, motivations, for, these, rule, changes, were, protection, of, the, health, of, the, fighters, the, desire, to, shed, the, perception, of, barbarism, and, lawlessness, and, to, be, recognized, as, a, legitimate, sport, the, new, rules, included, the, introduction, of, weight, classes, as, knowledge, about, submissions, spread, differences, in, weight, had, become, a, significant, factor, there, are, nine, different, weight, classes, in, the, unified, rules, of, mixed, martial, arts, these, nine, weight, classes, include, flyweight, up, to, 125, lb, 56, 7, kg, bantamweight, up, to, 135, lb, 61, 2, kg, featherweight, up, to, 145, lb, 65, 8, kg, lightweight, up, to, 155, lb, 70, 3, kg, welterweight, up,

toward, a, dominant, position, in, the, u, s, state, athletic, and, boxing, commissions, have, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, introduction, of, additional, rules, because, they, oversee, mma, in, a, similar, fashion, to, boxing, in, japan, and, most, of, europe, there, is, no, regulating, authority, over, competitions, so, these, organizations, have, greater, freedom, in, rule, development,

position, this, style, is, considered, by, many, fans, as, the, most, boring, style, of, fighting, and, is, highly, criticized, for, intentionally, creating, non, action, yet, it, is, effective, some,

fighting, championship, in, 1993, specifically, with, the, inception, of, the, unified, rules, of, mixed, martial, arts, there, remains, a, paucity, of, data, on, injuries, that, occur, in, mma, and, resulting, concerns, with, regard, to, mma, s, safety, remain, a, 2014, systematic, review, concluded, that, the, injury, incidence, rate, in, mma, appears, to, be, greater, than, in, most, if, not, all, other, popular, and, commonly, practiced, combat, sports, in, a, 2014, meta, analysis, of, the, available, injury, data, in, mma, the, injury, incidence, rate, was, estimated, to, be, 228, 7, injuries, per, 1000, athlete, exposures, one, athlete, exposure, is, defined, as, one, athlete, participating, in, a, single, fight, the, estimated, injury, incidence, rate, in, mma, is, greater, than, in, other, full, contact, combat, sports, such, as, judo, 44, 0, injuries, per, 1000, athlete, exposures, taekwondo, 79, 4, injuries, per, 1000, athlete, exposures, amateur, boxing, 77, 7, injuries, per, 1000, athlete, exposures, and, professional, boxing, 118, 0, 250, 6, injuries, per, 1000, athlete, exposures, in, general, the, injury, pattern, in, mma, is, very, similar, to, that, in, professional, boxing, but, unlike, that, found, in, other, combat, sports, such, as, judo, and, taekwondo, the, most, commonly, injured, body, region, is, the, head, 66, 8, to, 78, 0, of, reported, injuries, followed, by, the, wrist, hand, 6, 0, to, 12, 0, of, reported, injuries, while, the, most, frequent, types, of, injury, were, laceration, 36, 7, to, 59, 4, of, reported, injuries, fracture, 7, 4, to, 43, 3, of, reported, injuries, and, concussion, 3, 8, to, 20, 4, of, reported, injuries, the, frequency, of, impact, to, the, ear, and, low, utilization, of, ear, protection, leads, to, a, high, frequency, of, perichondral, hematoma, that, can, lead, to, cauliflower, ear, knocking, a, person, unconscious, or, even, causing, a, concussion, may, cause, permanent, brain, damage, there, is, no, clear, division, between, the, force, required, to, knock, a, person, out, and, the, force, probably, to, kill, a, person, also, contact, sports, especially, combat, sports, are, directly, related, to, a, brain, disease, called, chronic, traumatic, encephalopathy, abbreviated, cte, this, disease, begins, to, develop, during, the, life, of, the, athlete, and, continues, to, develop, even, after, sports, activity, has, ceased, in, addition, repetitive, and, subconcussive, blows, to, the, head, and, not, just, concussions, cause, cte, because, the, disease, is, detected, post, mortem, and, mma, are, relatively, young, there, are, still, few, cases, of, cte, recognized, in, mma, although, there, are, more, and, more, suspected, and, confirmed, cases, of, cte, in, preliminary, results, reported, in, april, 2012, as, part, of, an, ongoing, study, of, a, 109, professional, boxers, and, mma, fighters, being, conducted, by, charles, bernick, and, his, colleagues, at, cleveland, clinic, s, lou, ruvo, center, for, brain, health, fighters, with, more, than, six, years, of, ring, experience, were, observed, to, have, reductions, in, size, in, their, hippocampus, and, thalamus, while, fighters, with, more, than, twelve, years, of, ring, experience, were, observed, to, have, both, reductions, in, size, and, symptoms, such, as, memory, loss, the, hippocampus, and, thalamus, deal, with, memory, and, alertness, bernick, speculates, that, the, cumulative, damage, over, time, from, lesser, blows, may, eventually, prove, an, even, more, important, topic, of, study, than, that, of, infrequent, concussions, in, january, 2021, veteran, ufc, fighter, spencer, fisher, confirmed, to, mma, fighting, that, he, suffered, from, all, the, symptoms, of, cte, i, m, just, beat, up, and, it, s, just, gotten, worse, like, all, my, injuries, are, catching, up, with, me, now, aside, from, the, brain, thing, which, is, the, biggest, one, because, it, adds, it, adds, the, depression, and, putting, things, thoughts, together, and, staying, on, track, later, dana, white, ruled, on, this, he, s, not, the, first, and, he, s, definitely, not, going, to, be,

of, standards, which, will, be, universally, adhered, to, however, they, have, no, basis, in, national, law, and, are, meant, as, advisement, only, whereby, regulation, exists, however, the, likelihood, of, mma, being, legally, recognised, as, a, legitimate, sport, is, increased, this, was, the, case, with, france, who, banned, it, as, a, sport, in, 2016, due, to, a, lack, of, regulation,
