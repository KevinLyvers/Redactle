paris, was, the, central, hub, of, culture, and, economic, activity, and, as, such, the, most, highly, skilled, culinary, craftsmen, were, to, be, found, there, markets, in, paris, such, as, les, halles, la, m, gisserie, those, found, along, rue, mouffetard, and, similar, smaller, versions, in, other, cities, were, very, important, to, the, distribution, of, food, those, that, gave, french, produce, its, characteristic, identity, were, regulated, by, the, guild, system, which, developed, in, the, middle, ages, in, paris, the, guilds, were, regulated, by, city, government, as, well, as, by, the, french, crown, a, guild, restricted, those, in, a, given, branch, of, the, culinary, industry, to, operate, only, within, that, field, 71, 72, there, were, two, groups, of, guilds, first, those, that, supplied, the, raw, materials, butchers, fishmongers, grain, merchants, and, gardeners, the, second, group, were, those, that, supplied, prepared, foods, bakers, pastry, cooks, sauce, makers, poulterers, and, caterers, some, guilds, offered, both, raw, materials, and, prepared, food, such, as, the, charcutiers, and, r, tisseurs, purveyors, of, roasted, meat, dishes, they, would, supply, cooked, meat, pies, and, dishes, as, well, as, raw, meat, and, poultry, this, caused, issues, with, butchers, and, poulterers, who, sold, the, same, raw, materials, 72, 73, the, guilds, served, as, a, training, ground, for, those, within, the, industry, the, degrees, of, assistant, cook, full, fledged, cook, and, master, chef, were, conferred, those, who, reached, the, level, of, master, chef, were, of, considerable, rank, in, their, individual, industry, and, enjoyed, a, high, level, of, income, as, well, as, economic, and, job, security, at, times, those, in, the, royal, kitchens, did, fall, under, the, guild, hierarchy, but, it, was, necessary, to, find, them, a, parallel, appointment, based, on, their, skills, after, leaving, the, service, of, the, royal, kitchens, this, was, not, uncommon, as, the, paris, cooks, guild, regulations, allowed, for, this, movement, 73, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, french, cuisine, assimilated, many, new, food, items, from, the, new, world, although, they, were, slow, to, be, adopted, records, of, banquets, show, catherine, de, medici, 1519, 1589, serving, sixty, six, turkeys, at, one, dinner, 81, the, dish, called, cassoulet, has, its, roots, in, the, new, world, discovery, of, haricot, beans, which, are, central, to, the, dish, s, creation, but, had, not, existed, outside, of, the, americas, until, the, arrival, of, europeans, 85, haute, cuisine, pronounced, high, cuisine, has, foundations, during, the, 17th, century, with, a, chef, named, la, varenne, as, an, author, of, works, such, as, le, cuisinier, fran, ois, he, is, credited, with, publishing, the, first, true, french, cookbook, his, book, includes, the, earliest, known, reference, to, roux, using, pork, fat, the, book, contained, two, sections, one, for, meat, days, and, one, for, fasting, his, recipes, marked, a, change, from, the, style, of, cookery, known, in, the, middle, ages, to, new, techniques, aimed, at, creating, somewhat, lighter, dishes, and, more, modest, presentations, of, pies, as, individual, pastries, and, turnovers, la, varenne, also, published, a, book, on, pastry, in, 1667, entitled, le, parfait, confitvrier, republished, as, le, confiturier, fran, ois, which, similarly, updated, and, codified, the, emerging, haute, cuisine, standards, for, desserts, and, pastries, 114, 120, chef, fran, ois, massialot, wrote, le, cuisinier, ro, al, et, bourgeois, in, 1691, during, the, reign, of, louis, xiv, the, book, contains, menus, served, to, the, royal, courts, in, 1690, massialot, worked, mostly, as, a, freelance, cook, and, was, not, employed, by, any, particular, household, massialot, and, many, other, royal, cooks, received, special, privileges, by, association, with, the, french, royalty, they, were, not, subject, to, the, regulation, of, the, guilds, therefore, they, could, cater, weddings, and, banquets, without, restriction, his, book, is, the, first, to, list, recipes, alphabetically, perhaps, a, forerunner, of, the, first, culinary, dictionary, it, is, in, this, book, that, a, marinade, is, first, seen, in, print, with, one, type, for, poultry, and, feathered, game, while, a, second, is, for, fish, and, shellfish, no, quantities, are, listed, in, the, recipes, which, suggests, that, massialot, was, writing, for, trained, cooks, 149, 154, the, successive, updates, of, le, cuisinier, ro, al, et, bourgeois, include, important, refinements, such, as, adding, a, glass, of, wine, to, fish, stock, definitions, were, also, added, to, the, 1703, edition, the, 1712, edition, retitled, le, nouveau, cuisinier, royal, et, bourgeois, was, increased, to, two, volumes, and, was, written, in, a, more, elaborate, style, with, extensive, explanations, of, technique, additional, smaller, preparations, are, included, in, this, edition, as, well, leading, to, lighter, preparations, and, adding, a, third, course, to, the, meal, ragout, a, stew, still, central, to, french, cookery, makes, its, first, appearance, as, a, single, dish, in, this, edition, as, well, prior, to, that, it, was, listed, as, a, garnish, 155, shortly, before, the, french, revolution, dishes, like, bouch, es, la, reine, gained, prominence, essentially, royal, cuisine, produced, by, the, royal, household, this, is, a, chicken, based, recipe, served, on, vol, au, vent, created, under, the, influence, of, queen, marie, leszczy, ska, the, polish, born, wife, of, louis, xv, this, recipe, is, still, popular, today, as, are, other, recipes, from, queen, marie, leszczy, ska, like, consomm, la, reine, and, filet, d, aloyau, brais, la, royale, queen, marie, is, also, credited, with, introducing, polonaise, garnishing, to, the, french, diet, the, french, revolution, was, integral, to, the, expansion, of, french, cuisine, because, it, abolished, the, guild, system, this, meant, anyone, could, now, produce, and, sell, any, culinary, item, they, wished, bread, was, a, significant, food, source, among, peasants, and, the, working, class, in, the, late, 18th, century, with, many, of, the, nation, s, people, being, dependent, on, it, in, french, provinces, bread, was, often, consumed, three, times, a, day, by, the, people, of, france, according, to, brace, bread, was, referred, to, as, the, basic, dietary, item, for, the, masses, and, it, was, also, used, as, a, foundation, for, soup, in, fact, bread, was, so, important, that, harvest, interruption, of, commerce, by, wars, heavy, flour, exploration, and, prices, and, supply, were, all, watched, and, controlled, by, the, french, government, among, the, underprivileged, constant, fear, of, famine, was, always, prevalent, from, 1725, to, 1789, there, were, fourteen, years, of, bad, yields, to, blame, for, the, low, grain, supply, in, bordeaux, during, 1708, 1789, thirty, three, bad, harvests, occurred, marie, antoine, car, me, was, born, in, 1784, five, years, before, the, revolution, he, spent, his, younger, years, working, at, a, p, tisserie, until, he, was, discovered, by, charles, maurice, de, talleyrand, p, rigord, he, would, later, cook, for, napoleon, bonaparte, prior, to, his, employment, with, talleyrand, car, me, had, become, known, for, his, pi, ces, mont, es, which, were, extravagant, constructions, of, pastry, and, sugar, architecture, 144, 145, more, important, to, car, me, s, career, was, his, contribution, to, the, refinement, of, french, cuisine, the, basis, for, his, style, of, cooking, was, his, sauces, which, he, named, mother, sauces, often, referred, to, as, fonds, meaning, foundations, these, base, sauces, espagnole, velout, and, b, chamel, are, still, known, today, each, of, these, sauces, was, made, in, large, quantities, in, his, kitchen, then, formed, the, basis, of, multiple, derivatives, car, me, had, over, one, hundred, sauces, in, his, repertoire, in, his, writings, souffl, s, appear, for, the, first, time, although, many, of, his, preparations, today, seem, extravagant, he, simplified, and, codified, an, even, more, complex, cuisine, that, existed, beforehand, central, to, his, codification, of, the, cuisine, were, le, ma, tre, d, h, tel, fran, ais, 1822, le, cuisinier, parisien, 1828, and, l, art, de, la, cuisine, fran, aise, au, dix, neuvi, me, si, cle, 1833, 5, 144, 148, georges, auguste, escoffier, is, commonly, acknowledged, as, the, central, figure, to, the, modernization, of, haute, cuisine, and, organizing, what, would, become, the, national, cuisine, of, france, his, influence, began, with, the, rise, of, some, of, the, great, hotels, in, europe, and, america, during, the, 1880s, 1890s, the, savoy, hotel, managed, by, c, sar, ritz, was, an, early, hotel, in, which, escoffier, worked, but, much, of, his, influence, came, during, his, management, of, the, kitchens, in, the, carlton, from, 1898, until, 1921, he, created, a, system, of, parties, called, the, brigade, system, which, separated, the, professional, kitchen, into, five, separate, stations, these, five, stations, included, the, garde, manger, that, prepared, cold, dishes, the, entremettier, prepared, starches, and, vegetables, the, r, tisseur, prepared, roasts, grilled, and, fried, dishes, the, saucier, prepared, sauces, and, soups, and, the, p, tissier, prepared, all, pastry, and, desserts, items, this, system, meant, that, instead, of, one, person, preparing, a, dish, on, one, s, own, now, multiple, cooks, would, prepare, the, different, components, for, the, dish, an, example, used, is, oeufs, au, plat, meyerbeer, the, prior, system, would, take, up, to, fifteen, minutes, to, prepare, the, dish, while, in, the, new, system, the, eggs, would, be, prepared, by, the, entremettier, kidney, grilled, by, the, r, tisseur, truffle, sauce, made, by, the, saucier, and, thus, the, dish, could, be, prepared, in, a, shorter, time, and, served, quickly, in, the, popular, restaurants, 157, 159, escoffier, also, simplified, and, organized, the, modern, menu, and, structure, of, the, meal, he, published, a, series, of, articles, in, professional, journals, which, outlined, the, sequence, and, he, finally, published, his, livre, des, menus, in, 1912, this, type, of, service, embraced, the, service, la, russe, serving, meals, in, separate, courses, on, individual, plates, which, f, lix, urbain, dubois, had, made, popular, in, the, 1860s, escoffier, s, largest, contribution, was, the, publication, of, le, guide, culinaire, in, 1903, which, established, the, fundamentals, of, french, cookery, the, book, was, a, collaboration, with, phil, as, gilbert, e, fetu, a, suzanne, b, reboul, ch, dietrich, a, caillat, and, others, the, significance, of, this, is, to, illustrate, the, universal, acceptance, by, multiple, high, profile, chefs, to, this, new, style, of, cooking, 159, 160, le, guide, culinaire, deemphasized, the, use, of, heavy, sauces, and, leaned, toward, lighter, fumets, which, are, the, essence, of, flavor, taken, from, fish, meat, and, vegetables, this, style, of, cooking, looked, to, create, garnishes, and, sauces, whose, function, is, to, add, to, the, flavor, of, the, dish, rather, than, mask, flavors, like, the, heavy, sauces, and, ornate, garnishes, of, the, past, escoffier, took, inspiration, for, his, work, from, personal, recipes, in, addition, to, recipes, from, car, me, dubois, and, ideas, from, taillevent, s, le, viandier, which, had, a, modern, version, published, in, 1897, a, second, source, for, recipes, came, from, existing, peasant, dishes, that, were, translated, into, the, refined, techniques, of, haute, cuisine, expensive, ingredients, would, replace, the, common, ingredients, making, the, dishes, much, less, humble, the, third, source, of, recipes, was, escoffier, himself, who, invented, many, new, dishes, such, as, p, che, melba, 160, 162, escoffier, updated, le, guide, culinaire, four, times, during, his, lifetime, noting, in, the, foreword, to, the, book, s, first, edition, that, even, with, its, 5, 000, recipes, the, book, should, not, be, considered, an, exhaustive, text, and, that, even, if, it, were, at, the, point, when, he, wrote, the, book, it, would, no, longer, be, so, tomorrow, because, progress, marches, on, each, day, this, period, is, also, marked, by, the, appearance, of, the, nouvelle, cuisine, the, term, nouvelle, cuisine, has, been, used, many, times, in, the, history, of, french, cuisine, which, emphasized, the, freshness, lightness, and, clarity, of, flavor, and, inspired, by, new, movements, in, world, cuisine, in, the, 1740s, menon, first, used, the, term, but, the, cooking, of, vincent, la, chapelle, and, fran, ois, marin, was, also, considered, modern, in, the, 1960s, henri, gault, and, christian, millau, revived, it, to, describe, the, cooking, of, paul, bocuse, jean, and, pierre, troisgros, michel, gu, rard, roger, verg, and, raymond, oliver, these, chefs, were, working, toward, rebelling, against, the, orthodoxy, of, escoffier, s, cuisine, some, of, the, chefs, were, students, of, fernand, point, at, the, pyramide, in, vienne, and, had, left, to, open, their, own, restaurants, gault, and, millau, discovered, the, formula, contained, in, ten, characteristics, of, this, new, style, of, cooking, 163, 164, the, characteristics, that, emerged, during, this, period, were, 1, a, rejection, of, excessive, complication, in, cooking, 2, the, cooking, times, for, most, fish, seafood, game, birds, veal, green, vegetables, and, p, t, s, was, greatly, reduced, in, an, attempt, to, preserve, the, natural, flavors, steaming, was, an, important, trend, from, this, characteristic, 3, the, cuisine, was, made, with, the, freshest, possible, ingredients, 4, large, menus, were, abandoned, in, favor, of, shorter, menus, 5, strong, marinades, for, meat, and, game, ceased, to, be, used, 163, 164, 6, they, stopped, using, heavy, sauces, such, as, espagnole, and, b, chamel, thickened, with, flour, based, roux, in, favor, of, seasoning, their, dishes, with, fresh, herbs, quality, butter, lemon, juice, and, vinegar, 7, they, used, regional, dishes, for, inspiration, instead, of, haute, cuisine, dishes, 8, new, techniques, were, embraced, and, modern, equipment, was, often, used, bocuse, even, used, microwave, ovens, 9, the, chefs, paid, close, attention, to, the, dietary, needs, of, their, guests, through, their, dishes, 10, and, finally, the, chefs, were, extremely, inventive, and, created, new, combinations, and, pairings, 163, 164, some, have, speculated, that, a, contributor, to, nouvelle, cuisine, was, world, war, ii, when, animal, protein, was, in, short, supply, during, the, german, occupation, by, the, mid, 1980s, food, writers, stated, that, the, style, of, cuisine, had, reached, exhaustion, and, many, chefs, began, returning, to, the, haute, cuisine, style, of, cooking, although, much, of, the, lighter, presentations, and, new, techniques, remained, 163, 164, when, the, french, colonized, vietnam, one, of, the, most, famous, and, popular, dishes, pot, au, feu, was, subsequently, introduced, to, the, local, people, while, it, did, not, directly, create, the, widely, recognizable, vietnamese, dish, pho, it, served, as, a, reference, for, the, modern, day, form, of, pho, there, are, many, dishes, that, are, considered, part, of, french, national, cuisine, today, a, meal, often, consists, of, three, courses, hors, d, uvre, or, entr, e, introductory, course, sometimes, soup, plat, principal, main, course, fromage, cheese, course, or, dessert, sometimes, with, a, salad, offered, before, the, cheese, or, dessert, the, notion, of, a, french, national, cuisine, is, understood, as, a, set, of, foods, that, all, people, eat, and, have, strong, opinions, about, regardless, of, class, those, who, are, poorer, still, eat, the, same, foods, as, the, rich, albeit, less, frequently, french, regional, cuisine, is, characterized,
