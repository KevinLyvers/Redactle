shooting, sports, is, a, group, of, competitive, and, recreational, sporting, activities, involving, proficiency, tests, of, accuracy, precision, and, speed, in, shooting, the, art, of, using, ranged, weapons, mainly, small, arms, firearms, and, airguns, in, forms, such, as, handguns, rifles, and, shotguns, and, bows, crossbows, shooting, sports, can, be, categorized, by, equipment, shooting, distances, targets, time, limits, and, degrees, of, athleticism, involved, shooting, sports, may, involve, both, team, and, individual, competition, and, team, performance, is, usually, assessed, by, summing, the, scores, of, the, individual, team, members, due, to, the, noise, of, shooting, and, the, high, and, often, lethal, impact, energy, of, the, projectiles, shooting, sports, are, typically, conducted, at, either, designated, permanent, shooting, ranges, or, temporary, shooting, fields, in, the, area, away, from, settlements, the, national, rifle, association, nra, was, founded, in, 1859, to, raise, the, funds, for, an, annual, national, rifle, meeting, for, the, encouragement, of, volunteer, rifle, corps, and, the, promotion, of, rifle, shooting, throughout, great, britain, target, shooting, was, a, favorite, sport, in, colonial, america, with, the, new, england, puritans, regularly, testing, their, shooting, skills, for, recreation, and, at, militia, training, days, the, scotch, irish, settlers, on, the, frontier, favored, shooting, matches, sponsored, by, tavern, keepers, turkey, shoots, were, popular, after, harvest, time, contestants, would, pay, an, entry, fee, and, everyone, who, killed, a, tethered, turkey, at, 110, yards, for, muskets, or, 165, yards, for, rifles, could, keep, the, bird, german, gunsmiths, in, pennsylvania, began, to, manufacture, flintlock, rifles, in, the, 1720s, which, became, especially, popular, among, hunters, because, of, its, long, range, accuracy, it, could, be, accurate, to, 200, yards, along, about, 1820, percussion, caps, and, the, locks, that, ignited, them, became, available, and, nearly, all, new, firearms, began, to, be, constructed, using, this, ignition, system, many, flintlock, firearms, were, also, subsequently, converted, to, the, percussion, system, which, was, a, relatively, simple, procedure, that, could, be, accomplished, by, local, gunsmiths, although, percussion, ignition, did, not, add, to, the, accuracy, of, the, firearm, the, time, between, when, the, firearm, firing, mechanism, or, lock, started, the, sequence, that, lead, to, the, ignition, of, the, propellant, in, the, barrel, was, shortened, drastically, this, made, getting, smaller, shot, groups, on, the, target, more, attainable, as, the, possibility, of, the, firearm, moving, off, the, aiming, point, after, the, shooter, pressed, the, trigger, was, lessened, this, shortened, ignition, time, which, is, referred, to, as, lock, time, was, and, still, is, a, very, important, factor, in, target, shooting, the, closed, design, of, the, percussion, system, materially, improved, reliability, of, the, firearm, especially, in, rainy, or, damp, conditions, the, faster, lock, time, also, made, hitting, fast, moving, aerial, targets, with, a, cloud, of, tiny, lead, pellets, shot, fired, from, a, smooth, bore, firearm, a, real, possibility, practicing, for, game, hunting, by, shooting, at, artificial, aerial, targets, launched, from, spring, powered, launching, devices, traps, became, highly, popular, and, led, to, the, development, of, the, modern, trap, skeet, and, sporting, clays, shooting, sports, in, 1831, a, sportsman, club, in, cincinnati, ohio, held, a, competitive, shoot, at, pigeons, and, quail, released, from, ground, traps, german, ethnic, communities, set, up, athletic, clubs, and, shooting, clubs, especially, in, the, midwestern, states, in, the, 1850, 1917, period, breach, loading, shotguns, introduced, in, the, 1860s, and, the, knowledge, of, rifles, by, civil, war, soldiers, made, trap, shooting, popular, however, there, was, human, humanitarian, opposition, to, killing, live, birds, and, the, passenger, pigeon, was, dying, out, so, glass, or, clay, targets, were, used, instead, concerned, over, poor, marksmanship, during, the, american, civil, war, veteran, union, officers, col, william, c, church, and, gen, george, wingate, formed, the, national, rifle, association, of, america, in, 1871, for, the, purpose, of, promoting, and, encouraging, rifle, shooting, on, a, scientific, basis, in, 1872, with, financial, help, from, new, york, state, a, site, on, long, island, the, creed, farm, was, purchased, for, the, purpose, of, building, a, rifle, range, named, creedmoor, the, range, opened, in, 1872, and, became, the, site, of, the, first, national, matches, until, new, york, politics, forced, the, nraoa, to, move, the, matches, to, sea, girt, new, jersey, the, popularity, of, the, national, matches, soon, forced, the, event, to, be, moved, to, its, present, much, larger, location, camp, perry, in, 1903, the, u, s, congress, created, the, national, board, for, the, promotion, of, rifle, practice, nbprp, an, advisory, board, to, the, secretary, of, the, army, with, a, nearly, identical, charter, to, the, nraoa, the, nbprp, now, known, as, the, civilian, marksmanship, program, also, participates, in, the, national, matches, at, camp, perry, in, 1903, the, nra, of, america, began, to, establish, rifle, clubs, at, all, major, colleges, universities, and, military, academies, by, 1906, youth, programs, were, in, full, swing, with, more, than, 200, boys, competing, in, the, national, matches, today, more, than, one, million, youth, participate, in, shooting, sports, events, and, affiliated, programs, through, groups, such, as, 4, h, the, boy, scouts, of, america, the, american, legion, u, s, jaycees, ncaa, the, usa, high, school, clay, target, league, the, scholastic, clay, target, program, national, guard, bureau, rotc, and, jrotc, french, pistol, champion, and, founder, of, the, modern, olympics, pierre, de, coubertin, participated, in, many, of, these, early, competitions, this, fact, certainly, contributed, to, the, inclusion, of, five, shooting, events, in, the, 1896, olympics, over, the, years, the, events, have, been, changed, a, number, of, times, in, order, to, keep, up, with, technology, and, social, standards, the, targets, that, formerly, resembled, humans, or, animals, in, their, shape, and, size, have, are, now, a, circular, shape, in, order, to, avoid, associating, the, sport, with, any, form, of, violence, at, the, same, time, some, events, have, been, dropped, and, new, ones, have, been, added, the, 2004, olympics, featured, three, shooting, disciplines, rifle, pistol, and, shotgun, where, athletes, competed, for, 51, medals, in, 10, men, s, and, 7, women, s, events, slightly, fewer, than, the, previous, olympic, schedule, in, the, olympic, games, the, shooting, sport, has, always, enjoyed, the, distinction, of, awarding, the, first, medals, of, the, games, internationally, the, international, shooting, sport, federation, issf, has, oversight, of, all, olympic, shooting, events, worldwide, while, national, governing, bodies, ngbs, administer, the, sport, within, each, country, shooting, at, the, summer, olympics, includes, fifteen, medal, events, covering, seven, disciplines, medal, events, are, evenly, distributed, between, rifle, pistol, and, shotgun, with, five, events, each, three, mixed, pairs, events, were, introduced, to, ensure, gender, equity, between, men, s, and, women, s, events, they, replaced, 50m, prone, rifle, 50m, free, pistol, and, double, trap, which, were, all, men, only, events, gun, shooting, sports, are, shot, with, either, firearms, or, air, guns, which, can, be, handguns, rifles, or, shotguns, handguns, are, handheld, small, arms, designed, to, be, shot, off, hand, without, needing, a, shoulder, stock, the, two, main, subtypes, of, handguns, are, pistols, and, revolvers, they, are, much, more, convenient, to, carry, in, general, but, usually, have, a, shorter, effective, range, and, less, accuracy, compared, to, long, guns, such, as, rifles, in, shooting, sports, revolvers, and, semi, automatic, pistols, are, the, most, commonly, used, a, rifle, is, a, long, gun, with, a, rifled, barrel, and, requires, the, use, of, both, hands, to, hold, and, brace, against, the, shoulder, via, a, stock, in, order, to, shoot, steadily, they, generally, have, a, longer, range, and, greater, accuracy, than, handguns, and, are, popular, for, hunting, in, shooting, sports, bolt, action, or, semi, automatic, rifles, are, the, most, commonly, used, a, shotgun, is, similar, to, a, rifle, but, often, smoothbore, and, larger, in, caliber, and, typically, fires, either, a, shell, containing, many, smaller, scattering, sub, projectiles, called, shots, or, a, single, large, projectile, called, a, slug, in, shooting, sports, shotguns, are, more, often, over, under, type, break, action, or, semi, automatic, shotguns, and, the, majority, of, shotgun, events, are, included, in, clay, pigeon, shooting, bullseye, shooting, is, a, category, of, pistol, and, rifle, shooting, disciplines, where, the, objective, is, to, achieve, as, many, points, as, possible, by, hitting, a, round, shooting, target, as, close, to, the, middle, as, possible, with, slow, precision, fire, these, disciplines, place, a, large, emphasis, on, precision, and, accuracy, through, sight, picture, breath, and, trigger, control, fixed, and, relatively, long, time, limits, give, the, competitors, time, to, concentrate, for, a, perfect, shot, an, example, of, bullseye, shooting, is, the, issf, pistol, and, rifle, disciplines, but, there, are, also, many, other, national, and, international, disciplines, which, can, be, classified, as, bullseye, shooting, the, shooting, distances, are, typically, given, in, round, numbers, such, as, 10, 25, 50, 100, 200, or, 300, meters, depending, on, firearm, type, and, discipline, competitions, are, usually, shot, from, permanent, shooting, ranges, and, with, the, same, target, arrangement, and, distance, from, match, to, match, usually, the, competitors, each, have, their, own, shooting, target, and, shoot, beside, each, other, simultaneously, because, of, the, relatively, simple, match, format, beginners, are, often, recommended, bullseye, shooting, in, order, to, learn, the, fundamentals, of, marksmanship, bullseye, shooting, is, part, of, the, summer, olympic, games, and, a, considerable, amount, of, training, is, needed, to, become, proficient, field, shooting, or, terrain, shooting, refer, to, a, set, of, pistol, and, rifle, shooting, disciplines, that, usually, are, shot, from, temporary, shooting, ranges, in, outdoor, terrain, at, varying, and, sometimes, unknown, distances, rather, than, at, permanent, shooting, ranges, at, fixed, distances, clay, pigeon, shooting, are, shotgun, disciplines, shot, at, flying, clay, pigeon, targets, running, target, shooting, refers, to, a, number, of, disciplines, involving, a, shooting, target, sometimes, called, a, boar, moose, or, deer, that, is, made, to, move, as, if, it, is, a, running, animal, events, of, this, type, include, shooting, at, the, 1908, summer, olympics, men, s, moving, target, small, bore, rifle, shooting,

shooting, sports, where, speed, is, of, equal, importance, as, precision, many, of, the, disciplines, involve, movement, and, when, using, handguns, they, are, often, drawn, from, a, holster, long, range, shooting, is, shooting, held, at, such, distances, that, sight, adjustment, based, from, judging, atmospherical, conditions, become, critical, benchrest, shooting, is, concerned, with, shooting, small, groups, with, the, rifleman, sitting, on, a, chair, bench, and, the, rifle, supported, from, a, table, of, all, shooting, disciplines, this, is, the, most, demanding, equipment, wise, depending, on, equipment, class, international, benchrest, competitions, are, governed, by, either, the, world, benchrest, shooting, federation, or, world, rimfire, and, air, rifle, benchrest, federation, metallic, silhouette, competitors, shoot, at, animal, shaped, steel, silhouettes, chickens, pigs, turkeys, and, rams, that, must, be, knocked, down, to, score, banks, of, 5, targets, are, placed, at, up, to, 500, meters, with, distance, and, size, of, target, determined, by, firearm, class, classes, include, handguns, small, bore, rifle, hunter, silhouette, high, power, rifle, hunter,

chambered, in, rifle, calibers, with, the, power, aerodynamic, efficiency, and, external, ballistics, required, for, precise, shooting, at, 200, meters, there, are, silhouette, categories, appropriate, for, virtually, all, types, of, adjustable, sight, pistols, and, rifles, only, excluding, high, velocity, armor, piercing, rounds, that, would, damage, targets, targets, for, open, sighted, guns, are, placed, between, 25, and, 200, meters, and, are, designed, to, provide, a, usable, size, of, the, hit, zone, of, about, 1, 5, milliradians, or, 5, minutes, of, arc, muzzleloading, are, concerned, with, shooting, replica, or, antique, guns, paralympic, shooting, also, known, as, shooting, para, sport, is, an, adaptation, of, shooting, sports, for, competitors, with,

equipment, classes, where, the, types, of, permitted, firearms, are, subject, to, type, approval, and, few, aftermarket, modifications, are, permitted, thus, the, terms, refer, to, permitted, equipment, and, modifications, rather, than, the, type, of, shooting, format, itself, the, names, service, rifle, and, service, pistol, stem, from, that, the, equipment, permitted, for, these, types, of, competitions, traditionally, were, based, on, standard, issue, firearms, used, by, one, or, several, armed, forces, and, civilian, versions, of, these, while, the, terms, production, factory, and, stock, often, are, applied, to, more, modern, disciplines, with, similar, restrictions, on, equipment, classes, factory, and, service, classes, are, often, restrictive, in, nature, and, the, types, of, firearms, permitted, are, usually, rugged, versatile, and, affordable, in, comparison, more, expensive, custom, competition, equipment, are, popular, in, more, permissive, equipment, classes, both, types, of, equipment, classes, can, be, found, within, many, disciplines, such, as, bullseye, field, practical, and, long, range, shooting, plinking, refers, to, informal, target, shooting, done, for, pleasure, or, practice, typically, at, non, standard, targets, such, as, tin, cans, logs, cartons, fruits, or, any, other, homemade, or, naturally, occurring, objects, like, rocks, however, it, is, unsafe, to, shoot, at, rocks, or, tree, branches, the, primary, appeals, of, plinking, as, a, sport, are, the, broad, variety, of, easily, available, locations, minimal, costs, freedom, in, practice, styles, and, more, relaxing, and, less, restrictive, shooting, experience, the, flexibility, of, target, choice, is, also, why, plinking, is, popular, a, small, three, dimensional, target, in, an, outdoors, setting, is, much, more, akin, to, a, real, world, hunting, and, varminting, scenario, presenting, a, better, simulated, opportunity, to, practice, shooting, skills, a, plinking, target, will, also, often, react, much, more, positively, to, a, hit, than, a, paper, target, used, in, formal, competitions, either, audibly, with, a, sharp, impact, sound, hence, the, name, plink, or, visually, by, bouncing, splattering, or, falling, over, steel, targets, used, for, formal, action, and, long, range, shooting, competitions, are, also, popular, for, plinking, due, to, the, ease, of, setting, up, and, confirming, good, hits, athletic, shooting, sports, are, hybrid, events, of, normally, stationary, shooting, sport, competitions, and, the, sport, of, athletics, or, other, physically, demanding, non, shooting, sports, many, were, borne, from, military, exercises, and, emphasize, physical, endurance, modern, competitive, archery, involves, shooting, arrows, at, a, target, for, accuracy, from, a, set, distance, or, distances, a, person, who, participates, in, archery, is, typically, called, an, archer, or, a, bowman, and, a, person, who, is, fond, of, or, an, expert, at, archery, is, sometimes, called, a, toxophilite, the, most, popular, competitions, worldwide, are, called, target, archery, another, form, particularly, popular, in, europe, and, america, is, field, archery, which, generally, is, shot, at, targets, set, at, various, distances, in, a, wooded, setting, 3d, archery, which, differs, from, field, archery, in, that, the, targets, are, animal, models, is, also, quite, popular, in, the, same, regions, there, are, also, several, other, lesser, known, and, historical, forms, as, well, as, archery, novelty, games, the, tournament, rules, vary, from, organization, to, organization, world, archery, federation, rules, are, often, considered, normative, but, large, non, wa, affiliated, archery, organizations, do, exist, with, different, rules, competitive, archery, in, the, united, states, is, governed, by, usa, archery, and, national, field, archery, association, nfaa, which, also, certifies, instructors, run, archery,

standardization, of, competition, style, is, based, upon, fukiya, and, governed, by, the, international, fukiyado, association, it, is, a, 10, metre, target, shooting, using, a, standardized, barrel, caliber, and, length, and, a, standardized, dart, length, and, weight, as, outlined, by, ifa, there, are, two, more, styles, both, based, upon, the, cherokee, annual, gathering, blowgun, competition, the, field, style, competition, is, similar, to, the, winter, biathlon, where, the, shooter, runs, from, a, starting, line, to, a, target, lane, shoots, and, retrieves, the, darts, and, continues, to, the, next, station, the, course, length, varies, from, 400, to, 800, m, with, from, 9, to, 16, targets, at, various, heights, and, shooting, distances, the, final, style, is, the, long, distance, target, shoot, the, target, is, a, circle, of, 24, cm, diameter, and, the, firing, line, is, 20, m, away, three, darts, are, fired, by, each, shooter, at, least, one, of, which, must, stick, in, the, target, all, successful, shooters, move, to, the, next, round, moving, back, 2, m, each, time, confrontational, shooting, sports, is, a, set, of, relatively, new, team, sports, using, non, lethal, ranged, weapons, that, are, safe, enough, to, shoot, at, other, people, previously, such, games, were, not, possible, due, to, safety, concerns, since, bows, and, guns, are, generally, too, lethal, and, dangerous, for, human, targets, but, the, development, of, newer, airgun, and, infrared, technologies, allowed, for, the, development, of, safe, confrontational, disciplines, while, initially, only, for, sport, and, recreations, professional, sport, competitions, are, now, held, these, type, of, games, are, also, used, for, tactical, gunfight, training, by, military, and, law, enforcement, agencies, to, some, extent, olympic, dueling, is, an, archaic, individual, sport, that, sought, to, safely, emulate, the, deadly, practice, of, pistol, duelling, akin, to, fencing, emulating, sword, fighting, it, involved, the, use, of, specially, built, primer, fired, pistols, to, propel, wax, bullets, two, versions, of, the, sport, were, demonstration, events, at, the, 1906, olympics, and, 1908, olympics, it, was, also, a, popular, sport, in, france, paintball, is, a, competitive, sport, in, which, players, from, opposing, teams, eliminate, opponents, out, of, play, by, hitting, them, with, round, breakable, dye, filled, oil, and, gelatin, pellets, paintballs, shot, from, hpa, co, 2, powered, air, guns, called, paintball, markers, it, can, be, played, on, indoor, or, outdoor, fields, scattered, with, natural, or, artificial, terrain, which, players, use, for, tactical, cover, paintball, game, types, vary, but, can, include, capture, the, flag, elimination, ammunition, limits, defending, or, attacking, a, particular, point, or, area, or, capturing, objects, of, interest, hidden, in, the, playing, area, depending, on, the, variant, played, games, can, last, from, seconds, to, hours, or, even, days, in, scenario, play, the, game, was, developed, in, the, 1980s, and, is, now, regularly, played, at, a, formal, sporting, level, with, organized, competition, involving, major, tournaments, professional, teams, and, players, airsoft, is, a, competitive, sport, similar, in, concept, to, paintball, in, which, participants, from, opposing, teams, eliminate, opponents, by, hitting, each, other, with, solid, round, plastic, pellets, launched, from, low, powered, smoothbore, air, guns, called, airsoft, guns, it, is, different, from, paintball, in, that, airsoft, pellets, do, not, visibly, mark, the, targets, like, paintballs, and, thus, the, sport, relies, heavily, on, an, honor, system, where, a, hit, player, has, the, ethical, duty, to, call, himself, out, of, play, regardless, of, whether, anyone, else, sees, it, happen, most, airsoft, guns, are, also, magazine, fed, unlike, the, commonly, top, mounting, pellet, loader, of, paintball, markers, with, mounting, platforms, compatible, with, real, firearm, accessories, and, tend, to, more, closely, resemble, real, guns, in, appearance, making, them, more, popular, for, military, simulation, and, historical, reenactments, the, greater, toughness, of, airsoft, pellets, also, allows, the, use, of, better, powerplants, and, apparatus, such, as, hop, up, device, for, improved, external, ballistics, making, the, gameplay, more, accurately, resemble, real, gunfights, they, are, also, much, cheaper, for, casual, players, to, participate, than, paintball, airsoft, gameplay, varies, in, style, and, composition, just, like, paintball, and, is, played, in, both, indoor, and, outdoor, courses, situations, on, the, field, frequently, involve, the, use, of, real, life, military, tactics, to, achieve, objectives, and, it, is, not, uncommon, for, participants, to, emulate, the, uniforms, and, equipment, of, real, military, and, police, organizations, for, a, sense, of, realism, games, are, normally, supervised, and, sometimes, umpired, by, trained, on, site, administrators, and, players, airsoft, guns, are, usually, checked, through, a, chronograph, to, enforce, power, output, restrictions, there, are, currently, no, formal, national, or, international, governing, bodies, for, the, airsoft, sport, competitive, tournaments, are, usually, organized, by, private, clubs, or, among, enthusiasts, and, professional, semi, professional, teams, often, referred, to, as, clans, with, rules, and, restrictions, varying, from, event, to, event, laser, tag, despite, the, name, laser, is, actually, not, used, due, to, safety, concerns, is, a, tag, game, played, with, infrared, light, guns, and, sensors, worn, on, the, body, of, the, players, since, its, birth, in, 1979, laser, tag, has, evolved, in, both, indoor, and, outdoor, games, each, with, gameplay, styles, such, as, annihilation, capture, the, flag, domination, vip, protection, usually, sci, fi, role, playing, etc, when, compared, to, paintball, and, airsoft, laser, tag, is, painless, and, very, safe, because, it, involves, no, projectile, impacts, and, indoor, games, may, be, considered, less, physically, demanding, because, most, indoor, venues, prohibit, running, or, roughhousing, more, sophisticated, forms, of, laser, tag, such, as, miles, are, used, in, conjunction, with, blanks, by, militaries, to, allow, for, non, lethal, combat, training, archery, tag, is, a, form, of, combat, archery, sport, where, participants, shoot, one, another, using, a, bow, with, arrows, with, large, foam, tips, the, game, s, rules, closely, resemble, dodgeball, the, game, begins, with, a, number, of, arrows, in, the, center, of, the, arena, at, the, whistle, players, race, to, collect, them, before, firing, them, at, one, another, across, the, playing, field, a, player, is, eliminated, if, struck, by, an, arrow, and, a, player, can, bring, an, eliminated, teammate, back, into, play,
