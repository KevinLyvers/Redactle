wine, is, an, alcoholic, drink, made, from, fermented, fruit, yeast, consumes, the, sugar, in, the, fruit, and, converts, it, to, ethanol, and, carbon, dioxide, releasing, heat, in, the, process, wine, is, most, often, made, from, grapes, and, the, term, wine, generally, refers, to, grape, wine, when, used, without, any, qualification, even, so, wine, can, be, made, from, a, variety, of, fruit, crops, including, plum, cherry, pomegranate, blueberry, currant, and, elderberry, different, varieties, of, grapes, and, strains, of, yeasts, are, major, factors, in, different, styles, of, wine, these, differences, result, from, the, complex, interactions, between, the, biochemical, development, of, the, grape, the, reactions, involved, in, fermentation, the, grape, s, growing, environment, terroir, and, the, wine, production, process, many, countries, enact, legal, appellations, intended, to, define, styles, and, qualities, of, wine, these, typically, restrict, the, geographical, origin, and, permitted, varieties, of, grapes, as, well, as, other, aspects, of, wine, production, wine, has, been, produced, for, thousands, of, years, the, earliest, evidence, of, wine, is, from, the, present, day, georgia, 6000, bce, persia, 5000, bce, italy, and, armenia, 4000, bce, new, world, wine, has, some, connection, to, alcoholic, beverages, made, by, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, but, is, mainly, connected, to, later, spanish, traditions, in, new, spain, later, as, old, world, wine, further, developed, viticulture, techniques, europe, would, encompass, three, of, the, largest, wine, producing, regions, based, on, statistics, gathered, by, the, international, organisation, of, vine, and, wine, in, 2022, the, top, five, wine, producing, countries, are, italy, france, spain, the, united, states, and, australia, wine, has, long, played, an, important, role, in, religion, red, wine, was, associated, with, blood, by, the, ancient, egyptians, and, was, used, by, both, the, greek, cult, of, dionysus, and, the, romans, in, their, bacchanalia, judaism, also, incorporates, it, in, the, kiddush, and, christianity, in, the, eucharist, egyptian, greek, roman, and, israeli, wine, cultures, are, still, connected, to, these, ancient, roots, similarly, the, largest, wine, regions, in, italy, spain, and, france, have, heritages, in, connection, to, sacramental, wine, likewise, viticulture, traditions, in, the, southwestern, united, states, started, within, new, spain, as, catholic, friars, and, monks, first, produced, wines, in, new, mexico, and, california, the, earliest, known, traces, of, wine, are, from, georgia, c, 6000, bce, iran, persia, c, 5000, bce, armenia, c, 4100, bce, and, sicily, c, 4000, bce, wine, reached, the, mediterranean, basin, in, the, early, bronze, age, and, was, consumed, and, celebrated, by, ancient, civilizations, like, ancient, greece, and, rome, throughout, history, wine, has, been, consumed, for, its, intoxicating, effects, the, earliest, archaeological, and, archaeobotanical, evidence, for, grape, wine, and, viniculture, dating, to, 6000, 5800, bce, was, found, on, the, territory, of, modern, georgia, both, archaeological, and, genetic, evidence, suggest, that, the, earliest, production, of, wine, outside, of, georgia, was, relatively, later, likely, having, taken, place, elsewhere, in, the, southern, caucasus, which, encompasses, armenia, georgia, and, azerbaijan, or, the, west, asian, region, between, eastern, turkey, and, northern, iran, the, earliest, known, winery, from, 4100, bce, is, the, areni, 1, winery, in, armenia, a, 2003, report, by, archaeologists, indicates, a, possibility, that, grapes, were, mixed, with, rice, to, produce, fermented, drinks, in, ancient, china, in, the, early, years, of, the, seventh, millennium, bce, pottery, jars, from, the, neolithic, site, of, jiahu, henan, contained, traces, of, tartaric, acid, and, other, organic, compounds, commonly, found, in, wine, however, other, fruits, indigenous, to, the, region, such, as, hawthorn, cannot, be, ruled, out, if, these, drinks, which, seem, to, be, the, precursors, of, rice, wine, included, grapes, rather, than, other, fruits, they, would, have, been, any, of, the, several, dozen, indigenous, wild, species, in, china, rather, than, vitis, vinifera, which, was, introduced, 6000, years, later, in, 2020, a, 2, 600, year, old, well, preserved, phoenician, wine, press, was, excavated, at, tell, el, burak, south, of, sidon, in, lebanon, probably, devoted, to, making, wine, for, trading, in, their, colonies, the, spread, of, wine, culture, westwards, was, most, probably, due, to, the, phoenicians, who, spread, outward, from, a, base, of, city, states, along, the, mediterranean, coast, centered, around, modern, day, lebanon, as, well, as, including, small, parts, of, israel, palestine, and, coastal, syria, however, the, nuragic, culture, in, sardinia, already, had, a, custom, of, consuming, wine, before, the, arrival, of, the, phoenicians, the, wines, of, byblos, were, exported, to, egypt, during, the, old, kingdom, and, then, throughout, the, mediterranean, evidence, for, this, includes, two, phoenician, shipwrecks, from, 750, bce, found, with, their, cargoes, of, wine, still, intact, which, were, discovered, by, robert, ballard, as, the, first, great, traders, in, wine, cherem, the, phoenicians, seem, to, have, protected, it, from, oxidation, with, a, layer, of, olive, oil, followed, by, a, seal, of, pinewood, and, resin, similar, to, retsina, the, earliest, remains, of, apadana, palace, in, persepolis, dating, back, to, 515, bce, include, carvings, depicting, soldiers, from, achaemenid, empire, subject, nations, bringing, gifts, to, the, achaemenid, king, among, them, armenians, bringing, their, famous, wine, literary, references, to, wine, are, abundant, in, homer, 8th, century, bce, but, possibly, relating, earlier, compositions, alkman, 7th, century, bce, and, others, in, ancient, egypt, six, of, 36, wine, amphoras, were, found, in, the, tomb, of, king, tutankhamun, bearing, the, name, kha, y, a, royal, chief, vintner, five, of, these, amphoras, were, designated, as, originating, from, the, king, s, personal, estate, with, the, sixth, from, the, estate, of, the, royal, house, of, aten, traces, of, wine, have, also, been, found, in, central, asian, xinjiang, in, modern, day, china, dating, from, the, second, and, first, millennia, bce, the, first, known, mention, of, grape, based, wines, in, india, is, from, the, late, 4th, century, bce, writings, of, chanakya, the, chief, minister, of, emperor, chandragupta, maurya, in, his, writings, chanakya, condemns, the, use, of, alcohol, while, chronicling, the, emperor, and, his, court, s, frequent, indulgence, of, a, style, of, wine, known, as, madhu, the, ancient, romans, planted, vineyards, near, garrison, towns, so, wine, could, be, produced, locally, rather, than, shipped, over, long, distances, some, of, these, areas, are, now, world, renowned, for, wine, production, the, romans, discovered, that, burning, sulfur, candles, inside, empty, wine, vessels, kept, them, fresh, and, free, from, a, vinegar, smell, in, medieval, europe, the, roman, catholic, church, supported, wine, because, the, clergy, required, it, for, the, mass, monks, in, france, made, wine, for, years, aging, it, in, caves, an, old, english, recipe, that, survived, in, various, forms, until, the, 19th, century, calls, for, refining, white, wine, from, bastard, bad, or, tainted, bastardo, wine, later, the, descendants, of, the, sacramental, wine, were, refined, for, a, more, palatable, taste, this, gave, rise, to, modern, viticulture, in, french, wine, italian, wine, spanish, wine, and, these, wine, grape, traditions, were, brought, into, new, world, wine, for, example, mission, grapes, were, brought, by, franciscan, monks, to, new, mexico, in, 1628, beginning, the, new, mexico, wine, heritage, these, grapes, were, also, brought, to, california, which, started, the, california, wine, industry, thanks, to, spanish, wine, culture, these, two, regions, eventually, evolved, into, the, oldest, and, largest, producers, respectively, of, wine, of, the, united, states, viking, sagas, earlier, mentioned, a, fantastic, land, filled, with, wild, grapes, and, high, quality, wine, called, precisely, vinland, prior, to, the, spanish, establishing, their, american, wine, grape, traditions, in, california, and, new, mexico, both, france, and, britain, had, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, establish, grapevines, in, florida, and, virginia, respectively, in, east, asia, the, first, modern, wine, industry, was, japanese, wine, developed, in, 1874, after, grapevines, were, brought, back, from, europe, the, english, word, wine, comes, from, the, proto, germanic, winam, an, early, borrowing, from, the, latin, vinum, georgian, ghvee, no, wine, itself, derived, from, the, proto, indo, european, stem, win, o, cf, armenian, gini, ancient, greek, oinos, aeolic, greek, woinos, hittite, wiyana, lycian, oino, the, earliest, attested, terms, referring, to, wine, are, the, mycenaean, greek, me, tu, wo, ne, wo, meaning, in, the, month, or, festival, of, the, new, wine, and, wo, no, wa, ti, si, meaning, wine, garden, written, in, linear, b, inscriptions, linear, b, also, includes, inter, alia, an, ideogram, for, wine, i, e, the, ultimate, indo, european, origin, of, the, word, is, the, subject, of, some, continued, debate, some, scholars, have, noted, the, similarities, between, the, words, for, wine, in, indo, european, languages, e, g, armenian, gini, latin, vinum, ancient, greek, russian, kartvelian, e, g, georgian, and, semitic, wayn, hebrew, pointing, to, the, possibility, of, a, common, origin, of, the, word, denoting, wine, in, these, language, families, the, georgian, word, goes, back, to, proto, kartvelian, wino, which, is, either, a, borrowing, from, proto, indo, european, or, the, lexeme, was, specifically, borrowed, from, proto, armenian, einyo, whence, armenian, gini, an, alternate, hypothesis, by, f, hnrich, supposes, wino, a, native, kartvelian, word, derived, from, the, verbal, root, un, to, bend, see, wino, for, more, all, these, theories, place, the, origin, of, the, word, in, the, same, geographical, location, south, caucasus, that, has, been, established, based, on, archeological, and, biomolecular, studies, as, the, origin, of, viticulture, wine, types, the, types, have, such, different, properties, that, in, practice, they, are, considered, different, drinks, wine, is, made, in, many, ways, from, different, fruits, with, grapes, being, the, most, common, the, type, of, grape, used, and, the, amount, of, skin, contact, while, the, juice, is, being, extracted, determines, the, color, and, general, style, of, the, wine, the, color, has, no, relation, to, a, wine, s, sweetness, all, may, be, made, sweet, or, dry, red, wine, gains, its, color, and, flavor, notably, tannins, from, the, grape, skin, by, allowing, the, grapes, to, soak, in, the, extracted, juice, red, wine, is, made, from, dark, colored, red, grape, varieties, the, actual, color, of, the, wine, can, range, from, violet, typical, of, young, wines, through, red, for, mature, wines, to, brown, for, older, red, wines, the, juice, from, most, red, grapes, is, actually, greenish, white, the, red, color, comes, from, anthocyanins, present, in, the, skin, of, the, grape, a, notable, exception, is, the, family, of, rare, teinturier, varieties, which, actually, have, red, flesh, and, produce, red, juice, to, make, white, wine, grapes, are, pressed, quickly, with, the, juice, immediately, drained, away, from, the, grape, skins, the, grapes, used, are, typically, white, grape, varieties, though, red, grapes, may, be, used, if, the, winemaker, is, careful, not, to, let, the, skin, stain, the, wort, during, the, separation, of, the, pulp, juice, for, example, pinot, noir, a, red, grape, is, commonly, used, in, champagne, dry, low, sugar, white, wine, is, the, most, common, derived, from, the, complete, fermentation, of, the, juice, however, sweet, white, wines, such, as, moscato, d, asti, are, also, made, a, ros, wine, gains, color, from, red, grape, skins, but, not, enough, to, qualify, it, as, a, red, wine, it, may, be, the, oldest, known, type, of, wine, as, it, is, the, most, straightforward, to, make, with, the, skin, contact, method, the, color, can, range, from, a, pale, orange, to, a, vivid, near, purple, depending, on, the, varietals, used, and, wine, making, techniques, there, are, three, primary, ways, to, produce, ros, wine, skin, contact, allowing, dark, grape, skins, to, stain, the, wort, saign, e, removing, juice, from, the, must, early, in, fermentation, and, continuing, fermentation, of, the, juice, separately, and, blending, of, a, red, and, white, wine, uncommon, and, discouraged, in, most, wine, growing, regions, ros, wines, have, a, wide, range, of, sweetness, levels, from, dry, proven, al, ros, to, sweet, white, zinfandels, and, blushes, ros, wines, are, made, from, a, wide, variety, of, grapes, all, over, the, world, sometimes, called, amber, wines, these, are, wines, made, with, white, grapes, but, with, the, skins, allowed, to, soak, during, pressing, similar, to, red, and, ros, wine, production, they, are, notably, tannic, and, usually, made, dry, these, are, effervescent, wines, made, in, any, of, the, above, styles, i, e, orange, red, ros, white, they, must, undergo, secondary, fermentation, to, create, carbon, dioxide, which, creates, the, bubbles, two, common, methods, of, accomplishing, this, are, the, traditional, method, used, for, cava, champagne, and, more, expensive, sparkling, wines, and, the, charmat, method, used, for, prosecco, asti, and, less, expensive, wines, a, hybrid, transfer, method, is, also, used, yielding, intermediate, results, and, simple, addition, of, carbon, dioxide, is, used, in, the, cheapest, of, wines, the, bottles, used, for, sparkling, wine, must, be, thick, to, withstand, the, pressure, of, the, gas, behind, the, cork, which, can, be, up, to, 6, standard, atmospheres, 88, psi, this, refers, to, sweet, wines, that, have, a, high, level, of, sugar, remaining, after, fermentation, there, are, various, ways, of, increasing, the, amount, of, sugar, in, a, wine, yielding, products, with, different, strengths, and, names, icewine, port, sauternes, tokaji, asz, trockenbeerenauslese, and, vin, santo, are, some, examples, wines, from, other, fruits, such, as, apples, and, berries, are, usually, named, after, the, fruit, from, which, they, are, produced, and, combined, with, the, word, wine, for, example, apple, wine, and, elderberry, wine, and, are, generically, called, fruit, wine, or, country, wine, similar, to, french, term, vin, de, pays, other, than, the, grape, varieties, traditionally, used, for, wine, making, most, fruits, naturally, lack, either, sufficient, fermentable, sugars, proper, amount, of, acidity, yeast, amounts, needed, to, promote, or, maintain, fermentation, or, a, combination, of, these, three, materials, this, is, probably, one, of, the, main, reasons, why, wine, derived, from, grapes, has, historically, been, more, prevalent, by, far, than, other, types, and, why, specific, types, of, fruit, wines, have, generally, been, confined, to, the, regions, in, which, the, fruits, were, native, or, introduced, for, other, reasons, mead, also, called, honey, wine, is, created, by, fermenting, honey, with, water, sometimes, with, various, fruits, spices, grains, or, hops, as, long, as, the, primary, substance, fermented, is, honey, the, drink, is, considered, mead, mead, was, produced, in, ancient, history, throughout, europe, africa, and, asia, and, was, known, in, europe, before, grape, wine, other, drinks, called, wine, such, as, barley, wine, and, rice, wine, e, g, sake, huangjiu, and, cheongju, are, made, from, starch, based, materials, and, resemble, beer, more, than, traditional, wine, while, ginger, wine, is, fortified, with, brandy, in, these, latter, cases, the, term, wine, refers, to, the, similarity, in, alcohol, content, rather, than, to, the, production, process, the, commercial, use, of, the, english, word, wine, and, its, equivalent, in, other, languages, is, protected, by, law, in, many, jurisdictions, wine, is, usually, made, from, one, or, more, varieties, of, the, european, species, vitis, vinifera, such, as, pinot, noir, chardonnay, cabernet, sauvignon, gamay, and, merlot, when, one, of, these, varieties, is, used, as, the, predominant, grape, usually, defined, by, law, as, minimums, of, 75, to, 85, the, result, is, a, varietal, as, opposed, to, a, blended, wine, blended, wines, are, not, necessarily, inferior, to, varietal, wines, rather, they, are, a, different, style, of, wine, making, wine, can, also, be, made, from, other, species, of, grape, or, from, hybrids, created, by, the, genetic, crossing, of, two, species, v, labrusca, of, which, the, concord, grape, is, a, cultivar, v, aestivalis, v, rupestris, v, rotundifolia, and, v, riparia, are, native, north, american, grapes, usually, grown, to, eat, fresh, or, for, grape, juice, jam, or, jelly, and, only, occasionally, made, into, wine, hybridization, is, different, from, grafting, most, of, the, world, s, vineyards, are, planted, with, european, vitis, vinifera, vines, that, have, been, grafted, onto, north, american, species, rootstock, a, common, practice, due, to, their, resistance, to, phylloxera, a, root, louse, that, eventually, kills, the, vine, in, the, late, 19th, century, most, of, europe, s, vineyards, excluding, some, of, the, driest, in, the, south, were, devastated, by, the, infestation, leading, to, widespread, vine, deaths, and, eventual, replanting, grafting, is, done, in, every, wine, producing, region, in, the, world, except, in, argentina, and, the, canary, islands, the, only, places, not, yet, exposed, to, the, insect, in, the, context, of, wine, production, terroir, is, a, concept, that, encompasses, the, varieties, of, grapes, used, elevation, and, shape, of, the, vineyard, type, and, chemistry, of, soil, climate, and, seasonal, conditions, and, the, local, yeast, cultures, the, range, of, possible, combinations, of, these, factors, can, result, in, great, differences, among, wines, influencing, the, fermentation, finishing, and, aging, processes, as, well, many, wineries, use, growing, and, production, methods, that, preserve, or, accentuate, the, aroma, and, taste, influences, of, their, unique, terroir, however, flavor, differences, are, less, desirable, for, producers, of, mass, market, table, wine, or, other, cheaper, wines, where, consistency, takes, precedence, such, producers, try, to, minimize, differences, in, sources, of, grapes, through, production, techniques, such, as, micro, oxygenation, tannin, filtration, cross, flow, filtration, thin, film, evaporation, and, spinning, cones, about, 700, grapes, go, into, one, bottle, of, wine, approximately, 2, 6, pounds, regulations, govern, the, classification, and, sale, of, wine, in, many, regions, of, the, world, european, wines, tend, to, be, classified, by, region, e, g, bordeaux, rioja, and, chianti, while, non, european, wines, are, most, often, classified, by, grape, e, g, pinot, noir, and, merlot, market, recognition, of, particular, regions, has, recently, been, leading, to, their, increased, prominence, on, non, european, wine, labels, examples, of, recognized, non, european, locales, include, napa, valley, santa,

sauvignon, and, merlot, but, may, also, include, cabernet, franc, petit, verdot, and, malbec, commercial, use, of, the, term, meritage, is, allowed, only, via, licensing, agreements, with, the, meritage, association, france, has, various, appellation, systems, based, on, the, concept, of, terroir, with, classifications, ranging, from, vin, de, table, table, wine, at, the, bottom, through, vin, de, pays, and, appellation, d, origine, vin, d, limit, de, qualit, sup, rieure, aovdqs, up, to, appellation, d, origine, contr, l, e, aoc, or, similar, depending, on, the, region, portugal, has, developed, a, system, resembling, that, of, france, and, in, fact, pioneered, this, concept, in, 1756, with, a, royal, charter, creating, the, demarcated, douro, region, and, regulating, the, production, and, trade, of, wine, germany, created, a, similar, scheme, in, 2002, although, it, has, not, yet, achieved, the, authority, of, the, other, countries, classification, systems, spain, greece, and, italy, have, classifications, based, on, a, dual, system, of, region, of, origin, and, product, quality, new, world, wines, those, made, outside, the, traditional, wine, regions, of, europe, are, usually, classified, by, grape, rather, than, by, terroir, or, region, of, origin, although, there, have, been, unofficial, attempts, to, classify, them, by, quality, according, to, canadian, food, and, drug, regulations, wine, in, canada, is, an, alcoholic, drink, that, is, produced, by, the, complete, or, partial, alcoholic, fermentation, of, fresh, grapes, grape, must, products, derived, solely, from, fresh, grapes, or, any, combination, of, them, there, are, many, materials, added, during, the, course, of, the, manufacture, such, as, yeast, concentrated, grape, juice, dextrose, fructose, glucose, or, glucose, solids, invert, sugar, sugar, or, aqueous, solutions, calcium, sulphate, in, such, quantity, that, the, content, of, soluble, sulphates, in, the, finished, wine, shall, not, exceed, 0, 2, percent, weight, by, volume, calculated, as, potassium, sulphate, calcium, carbonate, in, such, quantity, that, the, content, of, tartaric, acid, in, the, finished, wine, shall, not, be, less, than, 0, 15, percent, weight, by, volume, also, sulphurous, acid, including, salts, thereof, in, such, quantity, that, its, content, in, the, finished, wine, shall, not, exceed, 70, parts, per, million, in, the, free, state, or, 350, parts, per, million, in, the, combined, state, calculated, as, sulphur, dioxide, caramel, amylase, and, pectinase, at, a,

or, a, weakly, basic, anion, exchange, resin, in, the, hydroxyl, ion, form, in, the, united, states, for, a, wine, to, be, vintage, dated, and, labeled, with, a, country, of, origin, or, american, viticultural, area, ava, e, g, sonoma, valley, 95, of, its, volume, must, be, from, grapes, harvested, in, that, year, if, a, wine, is, not, labeled, with, a, country, of, origin, or, ava, the, percentage, requirement, is, lowered, to, 85, vintage, wines, are, generally, bottled, in, a, single, batch, so, that, each, bottle, will, have, a, similar, taste, climate, s, impact, on, the, character, of, a, wine, can, be, significant, enough, to, cause, different, vintages, from, the, same, vineyard, to, vary, dramatically, in, flavor, and, quality, thus, vintage, wines, are, produced, to, be, individually, characteristic, of, the, particular, vintage, and, to, serve, as, the, flagship, wines, of, the, producer, superior, vintages, from, reputable, producers, and, regions, will, often, command, much, higher, prices, than, their, average, ones, some, vintage, wines, e, g, brunello, are, only, made, in, better, than, average, years, for, consistency, non, vintage, wines, can, be, blended, from, more, than, one, vintage, which, helps, wine, makers, sustain, a, reliable, market, image, and, maintain, sales, even, in, bad, years, one, recent, study, suggests, that, for, the, average, wine, drinker, the, vintage, year, may, not, be, as, significant, for, perceived, quality, as, had, been, thought, although, wine, connoisseurs, continue, to, place, great, importance, on, it, wine, tasting, is, the, sensory, examination, and, evaluation, of, wine, wines, contain, many, chemical, compounds, similar, or, identical, to, those, in, fruits, vegetables, and, spices, the, sweetness, of, wine, is, determined, by, the, amount, of, residual, sugar, in, the, wine, after, fermentation, relative, to, the, acidity, present, in, the, wine, dry, wine, for, example, has, only, a, small, amount, of, residual, sugar, some, wine, labels, suggest, opening, the, bottle, and, letting, the, wine, breathe, for, a, couple, of, hours, before, serving, while, others, recommend, drinking, it, immediately, decanting, the, act, of, pouring, a, wine, into, a, special, container, just, for, breathing, is, a, controversial, subject, among, wine, enthusiasts, in, addition, to, aeration, decanting, with, a, filter, allows, the, removal, of, bitter, sediments, that, may, have, formed, in, the, wine, sediment, is, more, common, in, older, bottles, but, aeration, may, benefit,

in, the, freezer, such, as, vodka, it, is, not, possible, to, safely, freeze, wine, in, the, bottle, as, there, is, insufficient, room, for, it, to, expand, as, it, freezes, and, the, bottle, will, usually, crack, certain, shapes, of, bottle, may, allow, the, cork, to, be, pushed, out, by, the, ice, but, if, the, bottle, is, frozen, on, its, side, the, wine, in, the, narrower, neck, will,
