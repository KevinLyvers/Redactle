rules, convention, that, the, contested, scrummage, be, replaced, with, a, line, of, scrimmage, where, the, team, with, the, ball, started, with, uncontested, possession, this, change, effectively, started, the, evolution, of, the, modern, game, of, gridiron, football, away, from, its, rugby, origins, rugby, union, is, both, a, professional, and, amateur, game, and, is, dominated, by, the,

popular, form, of, rugby, globally, the, olympic, games, have, admitted, the, seven, a, side, version, of, the, game, known, as, rugby, sevens, into, the, programme, from, rio, de, janeiro, in, 2016, onwards, there, was, a, possibility, sevens, would, be, a, demonstration, sport, at, the, 2012, london, olympics, but, many, sports, including, sevens, were, dropped, the, premier, international, competition, is, the, rugby, world, cup, currently, there, are, four, major, domestic, professional, leagues, globally, rugby, league, is, also, both, a, professional, and, amateur, game,

game, were, very, similar, to, the, point, where, the, united, states, was, able, to, win, the, gold, medal, for, rugby, union, at, the, 1920, and, 1924, summer, olympics, but, numerous, rule, changes, have, differentiated, the, gridiron, based, game, from, its, rugby, counterpart, introduced, by, walter, camp, in, the, united, states, and, john, thrift, meldrum, burnside, in, canada, among, unique, features, of, the, north, american, game, are, worldwide, there, are, two, major, professional, leagues, of, gridiron, football, both, domestic, distinctive, features, common, to, both, rugby, codes, include, the, use, of, an, oval, ball, and, the, prohibition, of, the, forward, pass, due, to, the, prohibition, players, can, gain, ground, only, by, running, with, the, ball, or, by, kicking, it, furthermore, unlike, american, and, canadian, football, neither, league, nor, union, players, wear, any, sort, of, protection, or, armour, the, two, rugby, codes, differ, as, the, result, of, changes, made, to, the, rules, of, rugby, league, league, implemented, these, changes, with, the, aim, of, making, a, faster, paced, and, more, try, oriented, game, than, rugby, union, the, main, differences, between, the, two, games, besides, league, having, teams, of, 13, players, and, union, of, 15, involve, the, tackle, and, its, aftermath, set, pieces, of, the, union, code, include, the, scrum, and, the, line, out, the, scrum, occurs, after, a, minor, infringement, of, the, rules, most, often, a, knock, on, when, a, player, knocks, the, ball, forward, after, an, infringement, packs, of, opposing, players, scrum, or, push, against, each, other, for, possession, in, a, line, out, parallel, lines, of, players, from, each, team, arranged, perpendicular, to, the, touch, line, attempt, to, catch, the, ball, thrown, from, touch, a, rule, has, been, added, to, line, outs, which, allows, the, jumper, to, be, pulled, down, once, a, players, feet, are, on, the, ground, in, the, league, code, the, scrum, still, exists, albeit, with, greatly, reduced, importance, in, league, the, scrum, involves, fewer, players, and, is, rarely, contested, set, pieces, are, generally, started, from, the, play, the, ball, situation, many, of, the, rugby, league, positions, have, names, and, requirements, similar, to, rugby, union, positions, notably, however, there, are, no, flankers, in, rugby, league, in, england, rugby, union, is, widely, regarded, as, an, establishment, sport, played, mostly, by, members, of, the, upper, and, middle, classes, for, example, many, pupils, at, public, schools, and, grammar, schools, play, rugby, union, although, the, game, which, had, a, long, history, of, being, played, at, state, schools, until, the, 1980s, is, becoming, increasingly, popular, in, comprehensive, schools, despite, this, stereotype, the, game, particularly, in, the, west, country, is, popular, amongst, all, classes, in, contrast, rugby, league, has, traditionally, been, seen, as, a, working, class, pursuit, another, exception, to, rugby, union, s, upper, class, stereotype, is, in, wales, where, it, has, been, traditionally, associated, with, small, village, teams, made, up, of, coal, miners, and, other, industrial, workers, who, played, on, their, days, off, in, ireland, both, rugby, union, and, rugby, league, are, unifying, forces, across, the, national, and, sectarian, divide, with, the, ireland, international, teams, representing, both, political, entities, in, australia, support, for, both, codes, is, concentrated, in, new, south, wales, queensland, and, the, australian, capital, territory, 55, of, the, population, though, rugby, league, is, far, more, popular, the, same, perceived, class, barrier, as, exists, between, the, two, games, in, england, also, occurs, in, these, states, fostered, by, rugby, union, s, prominence, and, support, at, private, schools, exceptions, to, the, above, include, new, zealand, although, rugby, league, is, still, considered, to, be, a, lower, class, game, by, many, or, a, game, for, westies, referring, to, lower, class, western, suburbs, of, auckland, and, more, recently, southern, auckland, where, the, game, is, also, dominant, wales, france, except, paris, cornwall, gloucestershire, somerset, scottish, borders, county, limerick, see, munster, rugby, and, the, pacific, islands, where, rugby, union, is, popular, in, working, class, communities, nevertheless, rugby, league, is, perceived, as, the, game, of, the, working, class, people, in, northern, england, and, in, the, australian, states, of,

rugby, league, as, rugby, league, or, league, in, the, u, s, people, who, play, rugby, are, sometimes, called, ruggers, a, term, little, used, elsewhere, except, facetiously, there, is, a, strong, tradition, of, rugby, union, in, france, particularly, in, the, basque, occitan, and, catalan, areas, along, the, border, with, spain, the, game, is, very, popular, in, south, africa, having, been, introduced, by, english, speaking, settlers, in, the, 19th, century, british, colonists, also, brought, the, game, with, them, to, australia, and, new, zealand, where, the, game, is, widely, played, it, has, spread, since, to, much, of, polynesia, having, particularly, strong, followings, in, fiji, samoa, and, tonga, rugby, union, continues, to, grow, in, the, americas, and, parts, of, asia, as, well, french, influence, and, the, influence, of, ex, pat, students, studying, in, france, expanded, rugby, s, reach, to, romania, and, georgia, which, are, the, preeminent, european, nations, behind, the, six, nations, championship, british, influence, spread, the, game, to, argentina, where, the, game, took, root, and, the, game, developed, in, italy, thanks, to, influence, from, both, france, and, argentina, both, argentina, and, italy, have, become, tier, 1, nations, in, the, sport, while, georgia, officially, a, tier, 2, nation, regularly, ranks, up, with, the, tier, 1, countries, about,

the, highest, number, of, catastrophic, injuries, out, of, any, team, sport, a, 2014, study, found, that, during, match, play, concussion, was, reported, at, a, higher, level, and, during, training,

upper, left, chest, with, the, popularity, of, rugby, over, the, years, many, betting, establishments, have, made, it, possible, for, viewers, of, the, game, to, place, wagers, on, games, the, various, types, of, wagers, that, can, be, placed, on, games, vary, however, the, main, types, of, bets, that, can, be, placed, are, as, follows, like, most, team, sports, both, forms, of, rugby, are, vulnerable, to, match, fixing, particularly, bets, involving, easily, manipulated, outcomes, such, as, conceding, penalties, and, first, point, scorer, a, recent, example, is, a, deliberate, infringement, by, ryan, tandy, in, order, for, the, first, points, scored, to, be, a, penalty, goal, in, a, 2010, nrl, match, the, attempt, backfired, when, instead, of, taking, a, shot, at, goal, a, try, was, scored
