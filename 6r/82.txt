vegetable, oils, or, vegetable, fats, are, oils, extracted, from, seeds, or, from, other, parts, of, edible, plants, like, animal, fats, vegetable, fats, are, mixtures, of, triglycerides, soybean, oil, grape, seed, oil, and, cocoa, butter, are, examples, of, seed, oils, or, fats, from, seeds, olive, oil, palm, oil, and, rice, bran, oil, are, examples, of, fats, from, other, parts, of, plants, in, common, usage, vegetable, oil, may, refer, exclusively, to, vegetable, fats, which, are, liquid, at, room, temperature, vegetable, oils, are, usually, edible, olive, oil, has, been, a, part, of, human, culture, for, millennia, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, olives, were, turned, into, olive, oil, by, 6000, bc, and, 4500, bc, in, present, day, israel, pagnol, p, 19, says, the, 6th, millennium, in, jericho, but, cites, no, source, in, ancient, egypt, plant, oils, including, cedar, oil, cypress, oil, and, olive, oil, were, used, during, the, mummification, process, vegetable, oils, have, been, used, as, lighting, fuel, for, lamps, cooking, medicine, and, lubrication, palm, oil, has, long, been, recognized, in, west, and, central, african, countries, and, european, merchants, trading, with, west, africa, occasionally, purchased, palm, oil, for, use, as, a, cooking, oil, in, europe, it, became, highly, sought, after, commodity, by, british, traders, for, use, as, an, industrial, lubricant, for, machinery, during, britain, s, industrial, revolution, palm, oil, formed, the, basis, of, soap, products, such, as, lever, brothers, now, unilever, sunlight, and, b, j, johnson, company, s, now, colgate, palmolive, palmolive, and, by, around, 1870, palm, oil, constituted, the, primary, export, of, some, west, african, countries, in, 1780, carl, wilhelm, scheele, demonstrated, that, fats, were, derived, from, glycerol, thirty, years, later, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, deduced, that, these, fats, were, esters, of, fatty, acids, and, glycerol, wilhelm, normann, a, german, chemist, introduced, the, hydrogenation, of, liquid, fats, in, 1901, creating, what, later, became, known, as, trans, fats, leading, to, the, development, of, the, global, production, of, margarine, and, vegetable, shortening, in, the, united, states, cottonseed, oil, was, developed, and, marketed, by, procter, gamble, as, a, creamed, shortening, crisco, as, early, as, 1911, ginning, mills, were, happy, to, have, someone, haul, away, the, cotton, seeds, the, extracted, oil, was, refined, and, partially, hydrogenated, to, give, a, solid, at, room, temperature, and, thus, mimic, natural, lard, and, canned, under, nitrogen, gas, compared, to, the, rendered, lard, procter, gamble, was, already, selling, to, consumers, crisco, was, cheaper, easier, to, stir, into, a, recipe, and, could, be, stored, at, room, temperature, for, two, years, without, turning, rancid, soybeans, are, protein, rich, and, the, medium, viscosity, oil, rendered, from, them, was, high, in, polyunsaturates, henry, ford, established, a, soybean, research, laboratory, developed, soybean, plastics, and, a, soy, based, synthetic, wool, and, built, a, car, almost, entirely, out, of, soybeans, roger, drackett, had, a, successful, new, product, with, windex, but, he, invested, heavily, in, soybean, research, seeing, it, as, a, smart, investment, by, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, soybean, oil, had, become, the, most, popular, vegetable, oil, in, the, us, today, it, is, second, only, to, palm, oil, in, 2018, 2019, world, production, was, at, 57, 4, mt, with, the, leading, producers, including, china, 16, 6, mt, us, 10, 9, mt, argentina, 8, 4, mt, brazil, 8, 2, mt, and, eu, 3, 2, mt, the, early, 20th, century, also, saw, the, start, of, the, use, of, vegetable, oil, as, a, fuel, in, diesel, engines, and, in, heating, oil, burners, rudolf, diesel, designed, his, engine, to, run, on, vegetable, oil, the, idea, he, hoped, would, make, his, engines, more, attractive, to, farmers, who, had, a, source, of, fuel, readily, available, diesel, s, first, engine, ran, on, its, own, power, for, the, first, time, in, augsburg, germany, on, 10, august, 1893, on, nothing, but, peanut, oil, in, remembrance, of, this, event, 10, august, has, been, declared, international, biodiesel, day, the, first, patent, on, biodiesel, was, granted, in, 1937, periodic, petroleum, shortages, spurred, research, into, vegetable, oil, as, a, diesel, substitute, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, and, again, in, the, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, when, straight, vegetable, oil, enjoyed, its, highest, level, of, scientific, interest, the, 1970s, also, saw, the, formation, of, the, first, commercial, enterprise, to, allow, consumers, to, run, straight, vegetable, oil, in, their, vehicles, however, biodiesel, produced, from, oils, or, fats, using, transesterification, is, more, widely, used, led, by, brazil, many, countries, built, biodiesel, plants, during, the, 1990s, and, it, is, now, widely, available, for, use, in, motor, vehicles, and, is, the, most, common, biofuel, in, europe, today, in, france, biodiesel, is, incorporated, at, a, rate, of, 8, in, the, fuel, used, by, all, french, diesel, vehicles, in, the, mid, 1970s, canadian, researchers, developed, a, low, erucic, acid, rapeseed, cultivar, because, the, word, rape, was, not, considered, optimal, for, marketing, they, coined, the, name, canola, from, canada, oil, low, acid, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, approved, use, of, the, canola, name, in, january, 1985, and, u, s, farmers, started, planting, large, areas, that, spring, canola, oil, is, lower, in, saturated, fats, and, higher, in, monounsaturates, canola, is, very, thin, unlike, corn, oil, and, flavorless, unlike, olive, oil, so, it, largely, succeeds, by, displacing, soy, oil, just, as, soy, oil, largely, succeeded, by, displacing, cottonseed, oil, the, production, of, vegetable, oils, went, up, 125, between, 2000, and, 2020, driven, by, a, sharp, increase, in, palm, oil, many, vegetable, oils, are, consumed, directly, or, indirectly, as, ingredients, in, food, a, role, that, they, share, with, some, animal, fats, including, butter, ghee, lard, and, schmaltz, the, oils, serve, a, number, of, purposes, in, this, role, oils, can, be, heated, to, temperatures, significantly, higher, than, the, boiling, point, of, water, 100, c, 212, f, and, used, to, fry, foods, oils, for, this, purpose, must, have, a, high, flash, point, such, oils, include, both, the, major, cooking, oils, soybean, rapeseed, canola, sunflower, safflower, peanut, cottonseed, etc, and, tropical, oils, such, as, coconut, palm, and, rice, bran, the, latter, are, particularly, valued, in, asian, cultures, for, high, temperature, cooking, because, of, their, unusually, high, flash, points, vegetable, oils, are, used, as, an, ingredient, or, component, in, many, manufactured, products, many, vegetable, oils, are, used, to, make, soaps, skin, products, candles, perfumes, and, other, personal, care, and, cosmetic, products, some, oils, are, particularly, suitable, as, drying, oils, and, are, used, in, making, paints, and, other, wood, treatment, products, they, are, used, in, alkyd, resin, production, dammar, oil, a, mixture, of, linseed, oil, and, dammar, resin, for, example, is, used, almost, exclusively, in, treating, the, hulls, of, wooden, boats, vegetable, oils, are, increasingly, being, used, in, the, electrical, industry, as, insulators, as, vegetable, oils, are, not, toxic, to, the, environment, biodegradable, if, spilled, and, have, high, flash, and, fire, points, however, vegetable, oils, are, less, stable, chemically, so, they, are, generally, used, in, systems, where, they, are, not, exposed, to, oxygen, and, they, are, more, expensive, than, crude, oil, distillate, synthetic, tetraesters, which, are, similar, to, vegetable, oils, but, with, four, fatty, acid, chains, compared, to, the, normal, three, found, in, a, natural, ester, are, manufactured, by, fischer, esterification, tetraesters, generally, have, high, stability, to, oxidation, and, have, found, use, as, engine, lubricants, vegetable, oil, is, being, used, to, produce, biodegradable, hydraulic, fluid, and, lubricant, one, limiting, factor, in, industrial, uses, of, vegetable, oils, is, that, all, such, oils, are, susceptible, to, becoming, rancid, oils, that, are, more, stable, such, as, ben, oil, or, mineral, oil, are, thus, preferred, for, industrial, uses, castor, oil, has, numerous, industrial, uses, owing, to, the, presence, of, a, hydroxyl, group, on, the, fatty, acid, castor, oil, is, a, precursor, to, nylon, 11, castor, oil, may, also, be, reacted, with, epichlorohydrin, to, make, a, glycidyl, ether, which, is, used, as, a, diluent, and, flexibilizer, with, epoxy, resins, vegetable, oil, is, used, in, the, production, of, some, pet, foods, aafco, defines, vegetable, oil, in, this, context, as, the, product, of, vegetable, origin, obtained, by, extracting, the, oil, from, seeds, or, fruits, which, are, processed, for, edible, purposes, vegetable, oils, are, also, used, to, make, biodiesel, which, can, be, used, like, conventional, diesel, some, vegetable, oil, blends, are, used, in, unmodified, vehicles, but, straight, vegetable, oil, also, known, as, pure, plant, oil, needs, specially, prepared, vehicles, which, have, a, method, of, heating, the, oil, to, reduce, its, viscosity, the, use, of, vegetable, oils, as, alternative, energy, is, growing, and, the, availability, of, biodiesel, around, the, world, is, increasing, the, nnfcc, estimates, that, the, total, net, greenhouse, gas, savings, when, using, vegetable, oils, in, place, of, fossil, fuel, based, alternatives, for, fuel, production, range, from, 18, to, 100, the, production, process, of, vegetable, oil, involves, the, removal, of, oil, from, plant, components, typically, seeds, this, can, be, done, via, mechanical, extraction, using, an, oil, mill, or, chemical, extraction, using, a, solvent, the, extracted, oil, can, then, be, purified, and, if, required, refined, or, chemically, altered, oils, can, be, removed, via, mechanical, extraction, termed, crushing, or, pressing, this, method, is, typically, used, to, produce, the, more, traditional, oils, e, g, olive, coconut, etc, and, it, is, preferred, by, most, health, food, customers, in, the, united, states, and, in, europe, there, are, several, different, types, of, mechanical, extraction, expeller, pressing, extraction, is, common, though, the, screw, press, ram, press, and, ghani, powered, mortar, and, pestle, are, also, used, oilseed, presses, are, commonly, used, in, developing, countries, among, people, for, whom, other, extraction, methods, would, be, prohibitively, expensive, the, ghani, is, primarily, used, in, india, the, amount, of, oil, extracted, using, these, methods, varies, widely, as, shown, in, the, following, table, for, extracting, mowrah, butter, in, india, the, processing, of, vegetable, oil, in, commercial, applications, is, commonly, done, by, chemical, extraction, using, solvent, extracts, which, produces, higher, yields, and, is, quicker, and, less, expensive, the, most, common, solvent, is, petroleum, derived, hexane, this, technique, is, used, for, most, of, the, newer, industrial, oils, such, as, soybean, and, corn, oils, after, extraction, the, solvent, is, evaporated, out, by, heating, the, mixture, to, about, 149, c, 300, f, supercritical, carbon, dioxide, can, be, used, as, a, non, toxic, alternative, to, other, solvents, unsaturated, vegetable, oils, can, be, transformed, through, partial, or, complete, hydrogenation, into, oils, of, higher, melting, point, some, of, which, such, as, vegetable, shortening, will, remain, solid, at, room, temperature, hydrogenating, vegetable, oil, is, done, by, raising, a, blend, of, vegetable, oil, and, a, metal, catalyst, typically, nickel, in, near, vacuum, to, very, high, temperatures, and, introducing, hydrogen, this, causes, the, carbon, atoms, of, the, oil, to, break, double, bonds, with, other, carbons, each, carbon, atom, becomes, single, bonded, to, an, individual, hydrogen, atom, and, the, double, bond, between, carbons, can, no, longer, exist, a, fully, hydrogenated, oil, also, called, a, saturated, fat, has, had, all, of, its, double, bonds, converted, into, single, bonds, if, a, polyunsaturated, oil, is, left, incompletely, hydrogenated, not, all, of, the, double, bonds, are, reduced, to, single, bonds, then, it, is, a, partially, hydrogenated, oil, pho, an, oil, may, be, hydrogenated, to, increase, resistance, to, rancidity, oxidation, or, to, change, its, physical, characteristics, as, the, degree, of, saturation, is, raised, by, full, or, partial, hydrogenation, the, oil, s, viscosity, and, melting, point, increase, while, full, hydrogenation, produces, largely, saturated, fatty, acids, partial, hydrogenation, results, in, the, transformation, of, unsaturated, cis, fatty, acids, to, unsaturated, trans, fatty, acids, in, the, oil, mixture, due, to, the, heat, used, in, hydrogenation, partially, hydrogenated, oils, and, their, trans, fats, have, been, linked, to, an, increased, risk, of, mortality, from, coronary, heart, disease, among, other, increased, health, risks, these, concerns, have, led, to, regulations, mandating, the, removal, of, partially, hydrogenated, oils, from, food, in, the, processing, of, edible, oils, the, oil, is, heated, under, vacuum, to, near, the, smoke, point, or, to, about, 232, c, 450, f, and, water, is, introduced, at, the, bottom, of, the, oil, the, water, immediately, is, converted, to, steam, which, bubbles, through, the, oil, carrying, with, it, any, chemicals, which, are, water, soluble, the, steam, sparging, removes, impurities, that, can, impart, unwanted, flavors, and, odors, to, the, oil, deodorization, is, key, to, the, manufacture, of, vegetable, oils, nearly, all, soybean, corn, and, canola, oils, found, on, supermarket, shelves, go, through, a, deodorization, stage, that, removes, trace, amounts, of, odors, and, flavors, and, lightens, the, color, of, the, oil, however, the, process, commonly, results, in, higher, levels, of, trans, fatty, acids, and, distillation, of, the, oil, s, natural, compounds, people, can, breathe, in, vegetable, oil, mist, in, the, workplace, the, u, s, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, has, set, the, legal, limit, permissible, exposure, limit, for, vegetable, oil, mist, exposure, in, the, workplace, as, 15, mg, m, 3, total, exposure, and, 5, mg, m, 3, respiratory, exposure, over, an, 8, hour, workday, the, u, s, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, rel, of, 10, mg, m, 3, total, exposure, and, 5, mg, m, 3, respiratory, exposure, over, an, 8, hour, workday, typical, productivity, of, some, oil, crops, measured, in, tons, t, of, oil, produced, per, hectare, ha, of, land, per, year, yr, oil, palm, is, by, far, the, highest, yielding, crop, capable, of, producing, about, 4, tons, of, palm, oil, per, hectare, per, year, the, following, triglyceride, vegetable, oils, account, for, almost, all, worldwide, production, by, volume, all, are, used, as, both, cooking, oils, and, as, svo, or, to, make, biodiesel, according, to, the, usda, the, total, world, consumption, of, major, vegetable, oils, in, 2007, 08, was, these, figures, include, industrial, and, animal, feed, use, the, majority, of, european, rapeseed, oil, production, is, used, to, produce, biodiesel, or, used, directly, as, fuel, in, diesel, cars, which, may, require, modification, to, heat, the, oil, to, reduce, its, higher, viscosity, other, significant, oils, include, seed, oils, are, vegetable, oils, obtained, from, the, seed, endosperm, rather, than, other, parts, of, plants, most, vegetable, oils, are, seed, oils, examples, are, sunflower, corn, and, sesame, oils, oils, are, extracted, first, by, expeller, or, cold, pressing, methods, then, solvent, expelling, the, rest, of, the, oils, from, the, leftover, matter, this, is, a, method, used, by, larger, capacity, oil, mills, as, the, energy, consumption, of, the, mechanical, press, increases, as, more, oil, is, released, it, is, more, efficient, to, extract, the, rest, of, the, oil, past, around, 60, by, solvent, extraction, a, large, quantity, of, used, vegetable, oil, is, produced, and, recycled, mainly, from, industrial, deep, fryers, in, potato, processing, plants, snack, food, factories, and, fast, food, restaurants, recycled, oil, has, numerous, uses, including, use, as, a, direct, fuel, as, well, as, in, the, production, of, biodiesel, livestock, feed, pet, food, soap, detergent, cosmetics, and, industrial, chemicals, since, 2002, an, increasing, number, of, european, union, countries, have, prohibited, the, inclusion, of, recycled, vegetable, oil, from, catering, in, animal, feed, used, cooking, oils, from, food, manufacturing, however, as, well, as, fresh, or, unused, cooking, oil, continue, to, be, used, in, their, animal, feed, due, to, their, susceptibility, to, oxidation, from, the, exposure, to, oxygen, heat, and, light, resulting, in, the, formation, of, oxidation, products, such, as, peroxides, and, hydroperoxides, plant, oils, rich, in, polyunsaturated, fatty, acids, have, a, limited, shelf, life, in, canada, palm, oil, is, one, of, five, vegetable, oils, along, with, palm, kernel, oil, coconut, oil, peanut, oil, and, cocoa, butter, which, must, be, specifically, named, in, the, list, of, ingredients, for, a, food, product, also, oils, in, canadian, food, products, which, have, been, modified, or, hydrogenated, must, contain, the, word, modified, or, hydrogenated, when, listed, as, an, ingredient, a, mix, of, oils, other, than, the, aforementioned, exceptions, may, simply, be, listed, as, vegetable, oil, in, canada, however, if, the, food, product, is, a, cooking, oil, salad, oil, or, table, oil, the, type, of, oil, must, be, specified, and, listing, vegetable, oil, as, an, ingredient, is, not, acceptable, from, december, 2014, all, food, products, produced, in, the, european, union, were, legally, required, to, indicate, the, specific, vegetable, oil, used, in, their, manufacture, following, the, introduction, of, the, food, information, to, consumers, regulation, this, article, incorporates, text, from, a, free,
