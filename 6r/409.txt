general, the, shorter, the, pool, the, faster, the, time, for, the, same, distance, since, the, swimmer, gains, speed, from, pushing, off, the, wall, after, each, turn, at, the, end, of, the, pool, width, the, width, of, the, pool, depends, on, the, number, of, swimming, lanes, and, the, width, of, each, individual, lane, in, an, olympic, swimming, pool, each, lane, is, 2, 5, meters, wide, and, contains, 10, lanes, thus, making, the, pool, 25, meters, wide, depth, the, depth, of, a, swimming, pool, depends, on, the, purpose, of, the, pool, and, whether, it, is, open, to, the, public, or, strictly, for, private, use, if, it, is, a, private, casual, relaxing, pool, it, may, go, from, 1, 0, to, 2, 0, m, 3, 3, to, 6, 6, ft, deep, if, it, is, a, public, pool, designed, for, diving, it,

to, accommodate, different, swimmer, requirements, in, many, jurisdictions, it, is, a, requirement, to, show, the, water, depth, with, clearly, marked, depths, affixed, to, the, pool, walls, pools, can, be, either, indoors, or, outdoors, they, can, be, of, any, size, and, shape, and, inground, or, above, ground, most, pools, are, permanent, fixtures, while, others, are, temporary, collapsible,

installed, swimming, pool, with, a, maximum, size, of, approximately, 3, m, 6, m, 10, ft, 20, ft, construction, methods, for, private, pools, vary, greatly, the, main, types, of, in, ground, pools, are, gunite, shotcrete, concrete, vinyl, lined, and, one, piece, fiberglass, shells, many, countries, now, have, strict, pool, fencing, requirements, for, private, swimming, pools, which, require, pool, areas, to, be, isolated, so, that, unauthorized, children, younger, than, six, years, cannot, enter, many, countries, require, a, similar, level, of, protection, for, the, children, residing, in, or, visiting, the, house, although, many, pool, owners, prefer, the, visual, aspect, of, the, pool, in, close, proximity, to, their, living, areas, and, will, not, provide, this, level, of, protection, there, is, no, consensus, between, states, or, countries, on, the, requirements, to, fence, private, swimming, pools, and, in, many, places, they, are, not, required, at, all, particularly, in, rural, settings, inexpensive, temporary, polyvinyl, chloride, pools, can, be, bought, in, supermarkets, and, taken, down, after, summer, they, are, used, mostly, outdoors, in, yards, are, typically, shallow, and, often, their, sides, are, inflated, with, air, to, stay, rigid, when, finished, the, water, and, air, can, be, let, out, and, this, type, of, pool, can, be, folded, up, for, convenient, storage, they, are, regarded, in, the, swimming, pool, industry, as, splasher, pools, intended, for, cooling, off, and, amusing, toddlers, and, children, not, for, swimming, hence, the, alternate, name, of, kiddie, pools, toys, are, available, for, children, and, other, people, to, play, with, in, pool, water, they, are, often, blown, up, with, air, so, they, are, soft, but, still, reasonably, rugged, and, can, float, in, water, public, pools, are, often, part, of, a, larger, leisure, center, or, recreational, complex, these, centres, often, have, more, than, one, pool, such, as, an, indoor, heated, pool, an, outdoor, chlorinated, saltwater, or, ozonated, pool, which, may, be, heated, or, unheated, a, shallower, children, s, pool, and, a, paddling, pool, for, toddlers, and, infants, there, may, also, be, a, sauna, and, one, or, more, hot, tubs, or, spa, pools, jacuzzis, many, upscale, hotels, and, holiday, resorts, have, a, swimming, pool, for, use, by, their, guests, if, a, pool, is, in, a, separate, building, the, building, may, be, called, a, natatorium, the, building, may, sometimes, also, have, facilities, for, related, activities, such, as, a, diving, tank, larger, pools, sometimes, have, a, diving, board, affixed, at, one, edge, above, the, water, many, public, swimming, pools, are, rectangles, 25, m, or, 50, m, long, but, they, can, be, any, size, and, shape, there, are, also, elaborate, pools, with, artificial, waterfalls, fountains, splash, pads, wave, machines, varying, depths, of, water, bridges, and, island, bars, some, swimming, facilities, have, lockers, for, clothing, and, other, belongings, the, lockers, can, require, a, coin, to, be, inserted, in, a, slot, either, as, deposit, or, payment, there, are, usually, showers, sometimes, mandatory, before, and, or, after, swimming, there, are, often, also, lifeguards, to, ensure, the, safety, of, users, wading, or, paddling, pools, are, shallow, bodies, of, water, intended, for, use, by, small, children, usually, in, parks, concrete, wading, pools, come, in, many, shapes, traditionally, rectangle, square, or, circle, some, are, filled, and, drained, daily, due, to, lack, of, a, filter, system, staff, chlorinate, the, water, to, ensure, health, and, safety, standards, the, f, d, ration, internationale, de, la, natation, fina, international, swimming, federation, sets, standards, for, competition, pools, 25, or, 50, m, 82, or, 164, ft, long, and, at, least, 1, 35, m, 4, 4, ft, deep, competition, pools, are, generally, indoors, and, heated, to, enable, their, use, all, year, round, and, to, more, easily, comply, with, the, regulations, regarding, temperature, lighting, and, automatic, officiating, equipment, an, olympic, size, swimming, pool, first, used, at, the, 1924, olympics, is, a, pool, that, meets, fina, s, additional, standards, for, the, olympic, games, and, for, world, championship, events, it, must, be, 50, by, 25, m, 164, by, 82, ft, wide, divided, into, eight, lanes, of, 2, 5, m, 8, 2, ft, each, plus, two, areas, of, 2, 5, m, 8, 2, ft, at, each, side, of, the, pool, depth, must, be, at, least, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, the, water, must, be, kept, at, 25, 28, c, 77, 82, f, and, the, lighting, level, at, greater, than, 1500, lux, there, are, also, regulations, for, color, of, lane, rope, positioning, of, backstroke, flags, 5, metres, from, each, wall, and, so, on, pools, claimed, to, be, olympic, pools, do, not, always, meet, these, regulations, as, fina, cannot, police, use, of, the, term, touchpads, are, mounted, on, both, walls, for, long, course, meets, and, each, end, for, short, course, a, pool, may, be, referred, to, as, fast, or, slow, depending, on, its, physical, layout, some, design, considerations, allow, the, reduction, of, swimming, resistance, making, the, pool, faster, namely, proper, pool, depth, elimination, of, currents, increased, lane, width, energy, absorbing, racing, lane, lines, and, gutters, and, the, use, of, other, innovative, hydraulic, acoustic, and, illumination, designs, in, the, last, two, decades, a, new, style, of, pool, has, gained, popularity, these, consist, of, a, small, vessel, usually, about, 2, 5, 5, m, in, which, the, swimmer, swims, in, place, either, against, the, push, of, an, artificially, generated, water, current, or, against, the, pull, of, restraining, devices, these, pools, have, several, names, such, as, swim, spas, swimming, machines, or, swim, systems, they, are, all, examples, of, different, modes, of, resistance, swimming, hot, tubs, and, spa, pools, are, common, heated, pools, used, for, relaxation, and, sometimes, for, therapy, commercial, spas, are, common, in, the, swimming, pool, area, or, sauna, area, of, a, health, club, or, fitness, center, in, men, s, clubs, women, s, clubs, motels, and, exclusive, five, star, hotel, suites, spa, clubs, may, have, very, large, pools, some, segmented, into, increasing, temperatures, in, japan, men, s, clubs, with, many, spas, of, different, size, and, temperature, are, common, commercial, spas, are, generally, made, of, concrete, with, a, mosaic, tiled, interior, more, recently, with, the, innovation, of, the, pre, form, composite, method, where, mosaic, tiles, are, bonded, to, the, shell, this, enables, commercial, spas, to, be, completely, factory, manufactured, to, specification, and, delivered, in, one, piece, hot, tubs, are, typically, made, somewhat, like, a, wine, barrel, with, straight, sides, from, wood, such, as, californian, redwood, held, in, place, by, metal, hoops, immersion, of, the, head, is, not, recommended, in, spas, or, hot, tubs, due, to, a, potential, risk, of, underwater, entrapment, from, the, pump, suction, forces, however, commercial, installations, in, many, countries, must, comply, with, various, safety, standards, which, reduce, this, risk, considerably, home, spas, are, a, worldwide, retail, item, in, western, countries, since, the, 1980s, and, are, sold, in, dedicated, spa, stores, pool, shops, department, stores, the, internet, and, catalog, sales, books, they, are, almost, always, made, from, heat, extruded, acrylic, sheet, perspex, often, colored, in, marble, look, alike, patterns, they, rarely, exceed, 6, m, 2, 65, sq, ft, and, are, typically, 1, m, 3, ft, 3, in, deep, restricted, by, the, availability, of, the, raw, sheet, sizes, typically, manufactured, in, japan, there, is, often, a, mid, depth, seating, or, lounging, system, and, contoured, lounger, style, reclining, seats, are, common, upmarket, spas, include, various, jet, nozzles, massage, pulsating, etc, a, drinks, tray, lights, lcd, flat, screen, tv, sets, and, other, features, that, make, the, pool, a, recreation, center, due, to, their, family, oriented, nature, home, spas, are, normally, operated, from, 36, to, 39, c, 97, to, 102, f, many, pools, are, incorporated, in, a, redwood, or, simulated, wood, surround, and, are, termed, portable, as, they, may, be, placed, on, a, patio, rather, than, sunken, into, a, permanent, location, some, portable, spas, are, shallow, and, narrow, enough, to, fit, sideways, through, a, standard, door, and, be, used, inside, a, room, low, power, electric, immersion, heaters, are, common, with, home, spas, whirlpool, tubs, first, became, popular, in, the, u, s, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, a, spa, is, also, called, a, jacuzzi, there, as, the, word, became, a, generic, after, plumbing, component, manufacturer, jacuzzi, introduced, the, spa, whirlpool, in, 1968, air, bubbles, may, be, introduced, into, the, nozzles, via, an, air, bleed, venturi, pump, that, combines, cooler, air, with, the, incoming, heated, water, to, cool, the, pool, if, the, temperature, rises, uncomfortably, high, some, spas, have, a, constant, stream, of, bubbles, fed, via, the, seating, area, of, the, pool, or, a, footwell, area, this, is, more, common, as, a, temperature, control, device, where, the, heated, water, comes, from, a, natural, uncontrolled, heat, geothermal, source, rather, than, artificially, heated, water, temperature, is, usually, very, warm, to, hot, 38, to, 42, c, 100, to, 108, f, so, bathers, usually, stay, in, for, only, 20, to, 30, minutes, bromine, or, mineral, sanitizers, are, often, recommended, as, sanitizers, for, spas, because, chlorine, dissipates, at, a, high, temperature, thereby, heightening, its, strong, chemical, smell, ozone, is, an, effective, bactericide, and, is, commonly, included, in, the, circulation, system, with, cartridge, filtration, but, not, with, sand, media, filtration, due, to, clogging, problems, with, turbid, body, fats, in, the, early, 20th, century, especially, in, australia, ocean, pools, were, built, typically, on, headlands, by, enclosing, part, of, the, rock, shelf, with, water, circulated, through, the, pools, by, flooding, from, tidal, tanks, or, by, regular, flooding, over, the, side, of, the, pools, at, high, tide, this, continued, a, pre, european, tradition, of, bathing, in, rockpools, with, many, of, the, current, sites, being, expanded, from, sites, used, by, aboriginal, australians, or, early, european, settlers, bathing, in, these, pools, provided, security, against, both, rough, surf, and, sea, life, there, were, often, separate, pools, for, women, and, men, or, the, pool, was, open, to, the, sexes, at, different, times, with, a, break, for, bathers, to, climb, in, without, fear, of, observation, by, the, other, sex, these, were, the, forerunners, of, modern, olympic, pools, a, variation, was, the, later, development, of, sea, or, harbour, side, pools, that, circulated, sea, water, using, pumps, a, pool, of, this, type, was, the, training, ground, for, australian, olympian, dawn, fraser, there, are, currently, about, 100, ocean, baths, in, new, south, wales, which, can, range, from, small, pools, roughly, 25, metres, long, and, olympic, sized, 50m, to, the, very, large, such, as, the, 50, 100, m, baths, in, newcastle, while, most, are, free, a, number, charge, fees, such, as, the, bondi, icebergs, club, pool, at, bondi, beach, despite, the, development, of, chlorinated, and, heated, pools, ocean, baths, remain, a, popular, form, of, recreation, in, new, south, wales, a, semi, natural, ocean, pool, exists, on, the, central, coast, of, new, south, wales, it, is, called, the, bogey, hole, an, infinity, pool, also, named, negative, edge, or, vanishing, edge, pool, is, a, swimming, pool, which, produces, a, visual, effect, of, water, extending, to, the, horizon, vanishing, or, extending, to, infinity, often, the, water, appears, to, fall, into, an, ocean, lake, bay, or, other, similar, body, of, water, the, illusion, is, most, effective, whenever, there, is, a, significant, change, in, elevation, though, having, a, natural, body, of, water, on, the, horizon, is, not, a, limiting, factor, natural, pools, were, developed, in, central, and, western, europe, in, the, early, and, mid, 1980s, by, designers, and, landscape, architects, with, environmental, concerns, they, have, recently, been, growing, in, popularity, as, an, alternative, to, traditional, swimming, pools, natural, pools, are, constructed, bodies, of, water, in, which, no, chemicals, or, devices, that, disinfect, or, sterilize, water, are, used, and, all, the, cleaning, of, the, pool, is, achieved, purely, with, the, motion, of, the, water, through, biological, filters, and, plants, rooted, hydroponically, in, the, system, in, essence, natural, pools, seek, to, recreate, swimming, holes, and, swimmable, lakes, the, environment, where, people, feel, safe, swimming, in, a, non, polluted, healthy, and, ecologically, balanced, body, of, water, water, in, natural, pools, has, many, desirable, characteristics, for, example, red, eyes, dried, out, skin, and, hair, and, bleached, swimsuits, associated, with, overly, chlorinated, water, are, naturally, absent, in, natural, pools, natural, pools, by, requiring, a, water, garden, to, be, a, part, of, the, system, offer, different, aesthetic, options, and, can, support, amphibious, wildlife, such, as, snails, frogs, and, salamanders, and, even, small, fish, if, desired, a, zero, entry, swimming, pool, also, called, a, beach, entry, swimming, pool, has, an, edge, or, entry, that, gradually, slopes, from, the, deck, into, the, water, becoming, deeper, with, each, step, in, the, manner, of, a, natural, beach, as, there, are, no, stairs, or, ladders, to, navigate, this, type, of, entry, assists, older, people, young, children, and, people, with, accessibility, problems, e, g, people, with, a, physical, disability, where, gradual, entry, is, useful, indoor, pools, are, located, inside, a, building, with, a, roof, and, are, insulated, by, at, least, three, walls, built, for, year, round, swimming, or, training, they, are, found, in, all, climate, types, since, the, buildings, around, indoor, pools, are, insulated, heat, escapes, much, less, making, it, less, expensive, to, heat, indoor, pools, than, outdoor, pools, all, of, whose, heat, escapes, architecturally, an, indoor, pool, may, look, like, the, rest, of, the, building, but, extra, heating, and, ventilation, and, other, engineering, solutions, are, required, to, ensure, comfortable, humidity, levels, in, addition, to, drainage, and, automatic, pool, covers, there, are, a, number, of, ways, to, remove, humidity, in, the, air, that, is, present, in, any, wet, indoor, environment, efficient, dehumidification, in, the, indoor, pool, environment, prevents, structural, damage, lowers, energy, costs, for, cooling, or, heating, and, improves, the, indoor, climate, to, provide, a, comfortable, swimming, environment, some, colleges, universities, and, high, schools, have, buildings, that, use, the, term, natatorium, in, their, names, especially, when, the, building, houses, more, than, just, a, swimming, pool, for, example, a, diving, well, or, facilities, for, water, polo, the, word, natatorium, was, borrowed, from, late, latin, place, for, swimming, into, english, in, new, england, in, 1890, this, type, of, swimming, pool, is, suspended, high, above, the, ground, a, prominent, example, is, the, sky, pool, in, london, s, embassy, gardens, the, world, s, first, floating, pool, swimming, pools, are, also, used, for, events, such, as, synchronized, swimming, water, polo, canoe, polo, and, underwater, sports, such, as, underwater, hockey, underwater, rugby, finswimming, and, sport, diving, as, well, as, for, teaching, diving, lifesaving, and, scuba, diving, techniques, they, have, also, been, used, for, specialist, tasks, such, as, teaching, water, ditching, survival, techniques, for, aircraft, and, submarine, crews, and, astronaut, training, round, cornered, irregular, swimming, pools, such, as, the, nude, bowl, were, drained, of, water, and, used, for, vertical, skateboarding, levels, of, bacteria, and, viruses, in, swimming, pool, water, must, be, kept, low, to, prevent, the, spread, of, diseases, and, pathogens, bacteria, algae, and, insect, larvae, can, breed, in, the, pool, if, water, is, not, properly, sanitized, pumps, mechanical, sand, filters, and, disinfectants, are, often, used, to, sanitise, the, water, chemical, disinfectants, such, as, chlorine, usually, as, a, hypochlorite, salt, such, as, calcium, hypochlorite, and, bromine, are, commonly, used, to, kill, pathogens, if, not, properly, maintained, chemical, sanitation, can, produce, high, levels, of, disinfection, byproducts, sanitized, swimming, pool, water, can, theoretically, appear, green, if, a, certain, amount, of, iron, salts, or, copper, chloride, are, present, in, the, water, acesulfame, potassium, has, been, used, to, estimate, how, much, urine, is, discharged, by, swimmers, into, a, pool, a, canadian, study, estimated, that, swimmers, had, released, 75, litres, of, urine, into, a, large, pool, that, had, about, 830, 000, litres, of, water, and, was, a, third, of, the, size, of, an, olympic, pool, hot, tubs, were, found, to, have, higher, readings, of, the, marker, while, urine, itself, is, relatively, harmless, its, degradation, products, may, lead, to, asthma, swimming, pool, heating, costs, can, be, significantly, reduced, by, using, a, pool, cover, use, of, a, pool, cover, also, can, help, reduce, the, amount, of, chemicals, chlorine, etc, required, by, the, pool, outdoor, pools, gain, heat, from, the, sun, absorbing, 75, 85, of, the, solar, energy, striking, the, pool, surface, though, a, cover, decreases, the, total, amount, of, solar, heat, absorbed, by, the, pool, the, cover, eliminates, heat, loss, due, to, evaporation, and, reduces, heat, loss, at, night, through, its, insulating, properties, most, swimming, pool, heat, loss, is, through, evaporation, in, areas, which, reach, freezing, temperature, it, is, important, to, close, a, pool, properly, this, varies, greatly, between, in, ground, and, above, ground, pools, by, taking, steps, to, properly, secure, the, pool, it, lessens, the, likelihood, that, the, superstructure, will, be, damaged, or, compromised, by, freezing, water, in, preparation, for, freezing, temperatures, an, in, ground, swimming, pool, s, pipes, must, be, emptied, an, above, ground, pool, should, also, be, closed, so, that, ice, does, not, drag, down, the, pool, wall, collapsing, its, structure, the, plumbing, is, sealed, with, air, typically, with, rubber, plugs, to, prevent, cracking, from, freezing, water, the, pool, is, typically, covered, to, prevent, leaves, and, other, debris, from, falling, in, the, cover, is, attached, to, the, pool, typically, using, a, stretch, cord, similar, to, a, bungee, cord, and, hooks, fitted, into, the, pool, surround, the, skimmer, is, closed, off, or, a, floating, device, is, placed, into, it, to, prevent, it, from, completely, freezing, and, cracking, floating, objects, such, as, life, rings, or, basketballs, can, be, placed, in, the, pool, to, avoid, its, freezing, under, the, cover, sand, or, de, filters, must, be, backwashed, with, the, main, drain, plug, removed, and, all, water, drained, out, drain, plugs, on, the, pool, filter, are, removed, after, the, filter, has, been, cleaned, the, pool, pump, motor, is, taken, under, cover, winter, chemicals, are, added, to, keep, the, pool, clean, the, innovation, of, a, composite, construction, of, fiberglass, with, an, epoxy, coating, and, porcelain, ceramic, tiles, has, led, to, the, pre, form, composite, type, with, significant, advantages, over, older, methods, however, it, also, has, increased, sensitivity, to, metal, staining, in, climates, where, there, is, no, risk, of, freezing, closing, down, the, pool, for, winter, is, not, so, important, typically, the, thermal, cover, is, removed, and, stored, winter, sunlight, can, create, an, algae, mess, when, a, cover, that, has, been, left, on, all, winter, is, removed, the, pool, is, correctly, ph, balanced, and, super, chlorinated, one, part, algaecide, for, every, 50, 000, parts, of, pool, water, should, be, added, and, topped, up, each, month, the, pool, should, be, filtered, for, one, to, two, hours, daily, to, keep, the, automated, chlorination, system, active, pools, pose, a, risk, of, drowning, which, may, be, significant, for, swimmers, who, are, inexperienced, suffer, from, seizures, or, are, susceptible, to, a, heart, or, respiratory, condition, lifeguards, are, employed, at, most, pools, to, execute, water, rescues, and, administer, first, aid, as, needed, in, order, to, reduce, this, risk, diving, in, shallow, areas, of, a, pool, may, also, lead, to, significant, head, and, neck, injuries, diving, especially, head, first, diving, should, be, done, in, the, deepest, point, of, the, pool, minimally, 2, 4, m, 7, ft, 10, in, but, desirably, 3, 7, m, 12, ft, deeper, if, the, distance, between, the, water, and, the, board, is, great, pools, also, present, a, risk, of, death, due, to, drowning, particularly, in, young, children, in, regions, where, residential, pools, are, common, drowning, is, a, major, cause, of, childhood, death, as, a, precaution, many, jurisdictions, require, that, residential, pools, be, enclosed, with, fencing, to, restrict, unauthorized, access, many, products, exist, such, as, removable, baby, fences, the, evidence, for, floating, alarms, and, window, door, alarms, to, reduce, the, risk, of, drowning, is, poor, some, pools, are, equipped, with, computer, aided, drowning, prevention, or, other, forms, of, electronic, safety, and, security, systems, suspended, ceilings, in, indoor, swimming, pools, are, safety, relevant, components, the, selection, of, materials, under, tension, should, be, done, with, care, especially, the, selection, of, unsuitable, stainless, steels, can, cause, problems, with, stress, corrosion, cracking, in, public, swimming, pools, dress, code, may, be, stricter, than, on, public, beaches, and, in, indoor, pools, stricter, than, outdoor, pools, for, example, in, countries, where, women, can, be, topless, on, the, beach, this, is, often, not, allowed, in, a, swimming, pool, and, a, swimsuit, must, be, worn, for, men, wearing, ordinary, shorts, and, a, t, shirt, to, go, in, the, water, at, a, beach, may, be, considered, acceptable, but, pools, usually, require, real, swimsuits, or, other, dedicated, water, wear, as, swimming, with, regular, clothes, can, potentially, weigh, a, swimmer, down, should, they, need, to, be, rescued, in, france, and, some, other, european, countries, board, shorts, are, usually, not, allowed, for, hygienic, reasons, in, nordic, countries, in, particular, iceland, rules, about, clothing, and, hygiene, are, especially, strict, when, diving, from, a, high, board, swimsuits, are, sometimes, worn, doubled, up, one, brief, inside, another, in, case, the, outer, suit, tears, on, impact, with, the, water
