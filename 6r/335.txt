action, sports, adventure, sports, or, extreme, sports, are, activities, perceived, as, involving, a, high, degree, of, risk, of, injury, or, death, these, activities, often, involve, speed, height, a, high, level, of, physical, exertion, and, highly, specialized, gear, extreme, tourism, overlaps, with, extreme, sport, the, two, share, the, same, main, attraction, adrenaline, rush, caused, by, an, element, of, risk, and, differ, mostly, in, the, degree, of, engagement, and, professionalism, there, is, no, precise, definition, of, an, extreme, sport, and, the, origin, of, the, term, is, unclear, but, it, gained, popularity, in, the, 1990s, when, it, was, picked, up, by, marketing, companies, to, promote, the, x, games, and, when, the, extreme, sports, channel, and, extreme, international, launched, more, recently, the, commonly, used, definition, from, research, is, a, competitive, comparison, or, self, evaluative, activity, within, which, the, participant, is, subjected, to, natural, or, unusual, physical, and, mental, challenges, such, as, speed, height, depth, or, natural, forces, and, where, fast, and, accurate, cognitive, perceptual, processing, may, be, required, for, a, successful, outcome, by, dr, rhonda, cohen, 2012, while, the, use, of, the, term, extreme, sport, has, spread, everywhere, to, describe, a, multitude, of, different, activities, exactly, which, sports, are, considered, extreme, is, debatable, there, are, however, several, characteristics, common, to, most, extreme, sports, while, they, are, not, the, exclusive, domain, of, youth, extreme, sports, tend, to, have, a, younger, than, average, target, demographic, extreme, sports, are, also, rarely, sanctioned, by, schools, for, their, physical, education, curriculum, extreme, sports, tend, to, be, more, solitary, than, many, of, the, popular, traditional, sports, rafting, and, paintballing, are, notable, exceptions, as, they, are, done, in, teams, activities, categorized, by, media, as, extreme, sports, differ, from, traditional, sports, due, to, the, higher, number, of, inherently, uncontrollable, variables, these, environmental, variables, are, frequently, weather, and, terrain, related, including, wind, snow, water, and, mountains, because, these, natural, phenomena, cannot, be, controlled, they, inevitably, affect, the, outcome, of, the, given, activity, or, event, in, a, traditional, sporting, event, athletes, compete, against, each, other, under, controlled, circumstances, while, it, is, possible, to, create, a, controlled, sporting, event, such, as, x, games, there, are, environmental, variables, that, cannot, be, held, constant, for, all, athletes, examples, include, changing, snow, conditions, for, snowboarders, rock, and, ice, quality, for, climbers, and, wave, height, and, shape, for, surfers, whilst, traditional, sporting, judgment, criteria, may, be, adopted, when, assessing, performance, distance, time, score, etc, extreme, sports, performers, are, often, evaluated, on, more, subjective, and, aesthetic, criteria, this, results, in, a, tendency, to, reject, unified, judging, methods, with, different, sports, employing, their, own, ideals, and, indeed, having, the, ability, to, evolve, their, assessment, standards, with, new, trends, or, developments, in, the, sports, the, origin, of, the, divergence, of, the, term, extreme, sports, from, sports, may, date, to, the, 1950s, in, the, appearance, of, a, phrase, usually, but, wrongly, attributed, to, ernest, hemingway, the, phrase, is, there, are, only, three, sports, bullfighting, motor, racing, and, mountaineering, all, the, rest, are, merely, games, the, implication, of, the, phrase, was, that, the, word, sport, defined, an, activity, in, which, one, might, be, killed, other, activities, being, termed, games, the, phrase, may, have, been, invented, by, either, writer, barnaby, conrad, or, automotive, author, ken, purdy, the, dangerous, sports, club, of, oxford, university, england, was, founded, by, david, kirke, chris, baker, ed, hulton, and, alan, weston, they, first, came, to, wide, public, attention, by, inventing, modern, day, bungee, jumping, by, making, the, first, modern, jumps, on, 1, april, 1979, from, the, clifton, suspension, bridge, bristol, england, they, followed, the, clifton, bridge, effort, with, a, jump, from, the, golden, gate, bridge, in, san, francisco, california, including, the, first, female, bungee, jump, by, jane, wilmot, and, with, a, televised, leap, from, the, royal, gorge, suspension, bridge, in, colorado, sponsored, by, and, televised, on, the, popular, american, television, program, that, s, incredible, bungee, jumping, was, treated, as, a, novelty, for, a, few, years, then, became, a, craze, for, young, people, and, is, now, an, established, industry, for, thrill, seekers, the, club, also, pioneered, a, surrealist, form, of, skiing, holding, three, events, at, st, moritz, switzerland, in, which, competitors, were, required, to, devise, a, sculpture, mounted, on, skis, and, ride, it, down, a, mountain, the, event, reached, its, limits, when, the, club, arrived, in, st, moritz, with, a, london, double, decker, bus, wanting, to, send, it, down, the, ski, slopes, and, the, swiss, resort, managers, refused, other, club, activities, included, expedition, hang, gliding, from, active, volcanoes, the, launching, of, giant, 20, m, plastic, spheres, with, pilots, suspended, in, the, centre, zorbing, microlight, flying, and, base, jumping, in, the, early, days, of, this, sport, in, recent, decades, the, term, extreme, sport, was, further, promoted, after, the, extreme, sports, channel, extremesportscompany, com, launched, and, then, the, x, games, a, multi, sport, event, was, created, and, developed, by, espn, the, first, x, games, known, as, 1995, extreme, games, were, held, in, newport, providence, mount, snow, and, vermont, in, the, united, states, certain, extreme, sports, clearly, trace, back, to, other, extreme, sports, or, combinations, thereof, for, example, windsurfing, was, conceived, as, a, result, of, efforts, to, equip, a, surfboard, with, a, sailing, boat, s, propulsion, system, mast, and, sail, kitesurfing, on, the, other, hand, was, conceived, by, combining, the, propulsion, system, of, kite, buggying, a, parafoil, with, the, bi, directional, boards, used, for, wakeboarding, wakeboarding, is, in, turn, derived, from, snowboarding, and, waterskiing, some, contend, that, the, distinction, between, an, extreme, sport, and, a, conventional, one, has, as, much, to, do, with, marketing, as, with, the, level, of, danger, involved, or, the, adrenaline, generated, for, example, rugby, union, is, both, dangerous, and, adrenaline, inducing, but, is, not, considered, an, extreme, sport, due, to, its, traditional, image, and, because, it, does, not, involve, high, speed, or, an, intention, to, perform, stunts, the, aesthetic, criteria, mentioned, above, and, also, it, does, not, have, changing, environmental, variables, for, the, athletes, a, feature, of, such, activities, in, the, view, of, some, is, their, alleged, capacity, to, induce, an, adrenaline, rush, in, participants, however, the, medical, view, is, that, the, rush, or, high, associated, with, the, activity, is, not, due, to, adrenaline, being, released, as, a, response, to, fear, but, due, to, increased, levels, of, dopamine, endorphins, and, serotonin, because, of, the, high, level, of, physical, exertion, furthermore, recent, studies, suggest, that, the, link, to, adrenaline, and, true, extreme, sports, is, tentative, brymer, and, gray, s, study, defined, true, extreme, sports, as, a, leisure, or, recreation, activity, where, the, most, likely, outcome, of, a, mismanaged, accident, or, mistake, was, death, this, definition, was, designed, to, separate, the, marketing, hype, from, the, activity, eric, brymer, also, found, that, the, potential, of, various, extraordinary, human, experiences, many, of, which, parallel, those, found, in, activities, such, as, meditation, was, an, important, part, of, the, extreme, sport, experience, those, experiences, put, the, participants, outside, their, comfort, zone, and, are, often, done, in, conjunction, with, adventure, travel, some, of, the, sports, have, existed, for, decades, and, their, proponents, span, generations, some, going, on, to, become, well, known, personalities, rock, climbing, and, ice, climbing, have, spawned, publicly, recognizable, names, such, as, edmund, hillary, chris, bonington, wolfgang, g, llich, and, more, recently, joe, simpson, another, example, is, surfing, invented, centuries, ago, by, the, inhabitants, of, polynesia, it, will, become, national, sport, of, hawaii, disabled, people, participate, in, extreme, sports, nonprofit, organizations, such, as, adaptive, action, sports, seek, to, increase, awareness, of, the, participation, in, action, sports, by, members, of, the, disabled, community, as, well, as, increase, access, to, the, adaptive, technologies, that, make, participation, possible, and, to, competitions, such, as, the, x, games, extreme, sports, may, be, perceived, as, extremely, dangerous, conducive, to, fatalities, near, fatalities, and, other, serious, injuries, the, perceived, risk, in, an, extreme, sport, has, been, considered, a, somewhat, necessary, part, of, its, appeal, which, is, partially, a, result, of, pressure, for, athletes, to, make, more, money, and, provide, maximum, entertainment, extreme, sports, is, a, sub, category, of, sports, that, are, described, as, any, kind, of, sport, of, a, character, or, kind, farthest, removed, from, the, ordinary, or, average, these, kinds, of, sports, often, carry, out, the, potential, risk, of, serious, and, permanent, physical, injury, and, even, death, however, these, sports, also, have, the, potential, to, produce, drastic, benefits, on, mental, and, physical, health, and, provide, opportunity, for, individuals, to, engage, fully, with, life, extreme, sports, trigger, the, release, of, the, hormone, adrenaline, which, can, facilitate, performance, of, stunts, it, is, believed, that, the, implementation, of, extreme, sports, on, mental, health, patients, improves, their, perspective, and, recognition, of, aspects, of, life, in, outdoor, adventure, sports, participants, get, to, experience, the, emotion, of, intense, thrill, usually, associated, with, the, extreme, sports, even, though, some, extreme, sports, present, a, higher, level, of, risk, people, still, choose, to, embark, in, the, experience, of, extreme, sports, for, the, sake, of, the, adrenaline, according, to, sigmund, freud, we, have, an, instinctual, death, wish, which, is, a, subconscious, inbuilt, desire, to, destroy, ourselves, proving, that, in, the, seek, for, the, thrill, danger, is, considered, pleasurable
