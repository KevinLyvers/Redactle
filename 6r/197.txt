a, sibling, is, a, relative, that, shares, at, least, one, parent, with, the, other, person, a, male, sibling, is, a, brother, and, a, female, sibling, is, a, sister, a, person, with, no, siblings, is, an, only, child, while, some, circumstances, can, cause, siblings, to, be, raised, separately, such, as, foster, care, most, societies, have, siblings, grow, up, together, this, causes, the, development, of, strong, emotional, bonds, with, siblinghood, considered, a, unique, type, of, relationship, the, emotional, bond, between, siblings, is, often, complicated, and, is, influenced, by, factors, such, as, parental, treatment, birth, order, personality, and, personal, experiences, outside, the, family, medically, a, full, sibling, is, a, first, degree, relative, and, a, half, sibling, is, a, second, degree, relative, as, they, are, related, by, 50, and, 25, respectively, the, word, sibling, was, reintroduced, in, 1903, in, an, article, in, biometrika, as, a, translation, for, the, german, geschwister, having, not, been, used, since, middle, english, specifically, 1425, siblings, or, full, siblings, sisters, or, brothers, share, the, same, biological, parents, full, siblings, are, also, the, most, common, type, of, siblings, twins, are, siblings, that, are, born, from, the, same, pregnancy, often, twins, with, a, close, relationship, will, develop, a, twin, language, from, infanthood, a, language, only, shared, and, understood, between, the, two, studies, corroborate, that, identical, twins, appear, to, display, more, twin, talk, than, fraternal, twins, at, about, 3, twin, talk, usually, ends, twins, generally, share, a, greater, bond, due, to, growing, up, together, and, being, the, same, age, half, siblings, half, sisters, or, half, brothers, are, people, who, share, one, parent, they, may, share, the, same, mother, but, different, fathers, in, which, case, they, are, known, as, uterine, siblings, or, maternal, half, siblings, or, they, may, have, the, same, father, but, different, mothers, in, which, case, they, are, known, as, agnate, siblings, or, paternal, half, siblings, in, law, the, term, consanguine, is, used, in, place, of, agnate, in, law, and, especially, inheritance, law, half, siblings, have, often, been, accorded, treatment, unequal, to, that, of, full, siblings, old, english, common, law, at, one, time, incorporated, inequalities, into, the, laws, of, intestate, succession, with, half, siblings, taking, only, half, as, much, property, of, their, intestate, siblings, estates, as, siblings, of, full, blood, unequal, treatment, of, this, type, has, been, wholly, abolished, in, england, but, still, exists, in, florida, three, quarter, siblings, share, one, parent, while, the, unshared, parents, are, first, degree, relatives, to, each, other, for, example, if, a, man, has, children, with, two, women, who, are, sisters, or, a, woman, has, children, with, a, man, and, his, son, in, the, first, case, the, children, are, half, siblings, as, well, as, first, cousins, in, the, second, the, children, are, half, siblings, as, well, as, an, avuncular, pair, they, are, genetically, closer, than, half, siblings, but, less, genetically, close, than, full, siblings, a, degree, of, genetic, relationship, that, is, rare, in, humans, and, little, studied, diblings, a, portmanteau, of, donor, sibling, or, donor, conceived, sibling, or, donor, sperm, sibling, are, biologically, connected, through, donated, eggs, or, sperm, diblings, are, biologically, siblings, though, not, legally, for, the, purposes, of, family, rights, and, inheritance, the, anonymity, of, donation, is, seen, to, add, complication, to, the, process, of, courtship, related, through, affinity, not, related, consanguinity, is, the, measure, of, how, closely, people, are, related, genetic, relatedness, measures, how, many, genes, a, person, shares, as, all, humans, share, over, 99, of, the, same, genes, consanguinity, only, matters, for, the, small, fraction, of, genes, which, vary, between, different, people, inheritance, of, genes, has, a, random, element, to, it, and, these, two, concepts, are, different, consanguinity, decreases, by, half, for, every, generation, of, reproductive, separation, through, their, most, recent, common, ancestor, siblings, are, 50, related, by, consanguinity, as, they, are, separated, from, each, other, by, two, generation, sibling, to, parent, to, sibling, and, they, share, two, parents, as, common, ancestors, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, displaystyle, left, tfrac, 1, 2, right, 2, left, tfrac, 1, 2, right, 2, a, fraternal, twin, is, a, sibling, and, therefore, is, related, by, 50, consanguinity, fraternal, twins, are, no, more, genetically, similar, than, regular, siblings, as, identical, twins, come, from, the, same, zygote, their, most, recent, common, ancestor, is, each, other, they, re, genetically, identical, and, 100, consanguineous, as, they, re, separated, by, zero, generations, 1, 2, 0, displaystyle, left, tfrac, 1, 2, right, 0, twin, studies, have, been, conducted, by, scientists, to, examine, the, roles, that, genetics, and, environment, play, in, the, development, of, various, traits, such, studies, examine, how, often, identical, twins, possess, the, same, behavioral, trait, and, compare, it, to, how, often, fraternal, twins, possess, the, same, trait, in, other, studies, twins, are, raised, in, separate, families, and, studies, compare, the, passing, on, of, a, behavioral, trait, by, the, family, environment, and, the, possession, of, a, common, trait, between, identical, twins, this, kind, of, study, has, revealed, that, for, personality, traits, which, are, known, to, be, heritable, genetics, play, a, substantial, role, throughout, life, and, an, even, larger, role, during, early, years, half, siblings, are, 25, related, by, consanguinity, as, they, share, one, parent, and, separated, from, each, other, by, two, generations, 1, 2, 2, displaystyle, left, tfrac, 1, 2, right, 2, a, person, may, share, more, than, the, standard, consanguinity, with, their, sibling, if, their, parents, are, related, the, coefficient, of, inbreeding, is, greater, than, zero, interestingly, half, siblings, can, be, related, by, as, three, quarters, siblings, related, by, 3, 8, if, their, unshared, parents, have, a, consanguinity, of, 50, this, means, the, unshared, parents, are, either, siblings, making, the, half, siblings, cousins, or, parent, and, child, making, them, half, aunt, uncle, and, niece, nephew, in, practice, full, siblings, do, not, share, exactly, 50, of, their, dna, as, chromosomal, crossover, only, occurs, a, limited, number, of, times, and, therefore, large, chunks, of, a, chromosome, are, shared, or, not, shared, at, one, time, in, fact, the, mean, dna, fraction, shared, is, 50, 28, with, a, standard, deviation, of, 3, 68, meaning, approximately, 1, 4, of, sibling, pairs, share, more, than, 52, 76, of, their, dna, while, 1, 4, share, less, than, 47, 8, there, is, a, very, small, chance, that, two, half, siblings, might, not, share, any, genes, if, they, didn, t, inherit, any, of, the, same, chromosomes, from, their, shared, parent, this, is, possible, for, full, siblings, as, well, though, even, more, unlikely, but, because, of, how, homologous, chromosomes, swap, genes, due, to, chromosomal, crossover, during, meiosis, during, the, development, of, an, egg, or, sperm, cell, however, the, odds, of, this, ever, actually, occurring, are, practically, non, existent, birth, order, is, a, person, s, rank, by, age, among, his, or, her, siblings, typically, researchers, classify, siblings, as, eldest, middle, child, and, youngest, or, simply, distinguish, between, first, born, and, later, born, children, birth, order, is, commonly, believed, in, pop, psychology, and, popular, culture, to, have, a, profound, and, lasting, effect, on, psychological, development, and, personality, for, example, firstborns, are, seen, as, conservative, and, high, achieving, middle, children, as, natural, mediators, and, youngest, children, as, charming, and, outgoing, despite, its, lasting, presence, in, the, public, domain, studies, have, failed, to, consistently, produce, clear, valid, compelling, findings, therefore, it, has, earned, the, title, of, a, pseudo, psychology, amongst, the, scientific, psychological, community, the, theorizing, and, study, of, birth, order, can, be, traced, back, to, francis, galton, s, 1822, 1911, theory, of, birth, order, and, eminence, and, alfred, adler, s, 1870, 1937, theory, of, birth, order, and, personality, characteristics, in, his, book, english, men, of, science, their, nature, and, nurture, 1874, galton, noted, that, prominent, composers, and, scientists, are, over, represented, as, first, borns, he, theorized, three, main, reasons, as, to, why, first, borns, are, generally, more, eminent, today, the, flaws, and, inconsistencies, in, birth, order, research, eliminate, its, validity, it, is, very, difficult, to, control, solely, for, factors, related, to, birth, order, and, therefore, most, studies, produce, ambiguous, results, embedded, into, theories, of, birth, order, is, a, debate, of, nature, versus, nurture, it, has, been, disproved, that, there, is, something, innate, in, the, position, one, is, born, into, and, therefore, creating, a, preset, role, birth, order, has, no, genetic, basis, the, social, interaction, that, occurs, as, a, result, of, birth, order, however, is, the, most, notable, older, siblings, often, become, role, models, of, behaviour, and, younger, siblings, become, learners, and, supervisees, older, siblings, are, at, a, developmental, advantage, both, cognitively, and, socially, the, role, of, birth, order, also, depends, greatly, and, varies, greatly, on, family, context, family, size, sibling, identification, age, gap, modeling, parenting, techniques, gender, class, race, and, temperament, are, all, confounding, variables, that, can, influence, behaviour, and, therefore, perceived, behaviour, of, specific, birth, categories, the, research, on, birth, order, does, have, stronger, correlations, however, in, areas, such, as, intelligence, and, physical, features, but, are, likely, caused, by, other, factors, other, than, the, actual, position, of, birth, some, research, has, found, that, firstborn, children, have, slightly, higher, iqs, on, average, than, later, born, children, however, other, research, finds, no, such, effect, it, has, been, found, that, first, borns, score, three, points, higher, compared, to, second, borns, and, that, children, born, earlier, in, a, family, are, on, average, taller, and, weigh, more, than, those, born, later, however, it, is, impossible, to, generalize, birth, order, characteristics, and, apply, them, universally, to, all, individuals, in, that, subgroup, blake, 1981, provide, three, potential, reasons, for, the, higher, scoring, of, older, siblings, on, iq, tests, robert, zajonc, proposed, that, the, intellectual, environment, within, a, family, is, ever, changing, due, to, three, factors, and, therefore, more, permissive, of, first, born, children, s, intellectual, advancement, in, 1996, interest, in, the, science, behind, birth, order, was, re, sparked, when, frank, sulloway, s, book, born, to, rebel, was, published, in, this, book, sulloway, argues, that, firstborns, are, more, conscientious, more, socially, dominant, less, agreeable, and, less, open, to, new, ideas, compared, to, later, borns, while, being, seemingly, empirical, and, academic, as, many, studies, are, cited, throughout, the, book, it, is, still, often, criticized, as, a, biased, and, incomplete, account, of, the, whole, picture, of, siblings, and, birth, order, because, it, is, a, novel, the, research, and, theories, proposed, throughout, were, not, criticized, and, peer, reviewed, by, other, academics, before, its, release, literature, reviews, that, have, examined, many, studies, and, attempted, to, control, for, confounding, variables, tend, to, find, minimal, effects, for, birth, order, on, personality, in, her, review, of, the, scientific, literature, judith, rich, harris, suggests, that, birth, order, effects, may, exist, within, the, context, of, the, family, of, origin, but, that, they, are, not, enduring, aspects, of, personality, in, practice, systematic, birth, order, research, is, a, challenge, because, it, is, difficult, to, control, for, all, of, the, variables, that, are, statistically, related, to, birth, order, for, example, large, families, are, generally, lower, in, socioeconomic, status, than, small, families, so, third, born, children, are, more, likely, than, first, born, children, to, come, from, poorer, families, spacing, of, children, parenting, style, and, gender, are, additional, variables, to, consider, regressive, behaviors, are, the, child, s, way, of, demanding, the, parents, love, and, attention, the, arrival, of, a, new, baby, is, especially, stressful, for, firstborns, and, for, siblings, between, 3, and, 5, years, old, in, such, situations, regressive, behavior, may, be, accompanied, by, aggressive, behavior, such, as, handling, the, baby, roughly, all, of, these, symptoms, are, considered, to, be, typical, and, developmentally, appropriate, for, children, between, the, ages, of, 3, and, 5, while, some, can, be, prevented, the, remainder, can, be, improved, within, a, few, months, regressive, behavior, may, include, demand, for, a, bottle, thumb, sucking, requests, to, wear, diapers, even, if, toilet, trained, or, requests, to, carry, a, security, blanket, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, suggests, that, instead, of, protesting, or, telling, children, to, act, their, age, parents, should, simply, grant, their, requests, without, becoming, upset, the, affected, children, will, soon, return, to, their, normal, routine, when, they, realize, that, they, now, have, just, as, important, a, place, in, the, family, as, the, new, sibling, most, of, the, behaviors, can, be, improved, within, a, few, months, the, university, of, michigan, health, system, advises, that, most, occurrences, of, regressive, behavior, are, mild, and, to, be, expected, however, it, recommends, parents, to, contact, a, pediatrician, or, child, psychologist, if, the, older, child, tries, to, hurt, the, baby, if, regressive, behavior, does, not, improve, within, 2, or, 3, months, or, if, the, parents, have, other, questions, or, concerns, sibling, rivalry, is, a, type, of, competition, or, animosity, among, brothers, and, sisters, it, appears, to, be, particularly, intense, when, children, are, very, close, in, age, or, of, the, same, gender, sibling, rivalry, can, involve, aggression, however, it, is, not, the, same, as, sibling, abuse, where, one, child, victimizes, another, sibling, rivalry, usually, starts, right, after, or, before, the, arrival, of, the, second, child, while, siblings, will, still, love, each, other, it, is, not, uncommon, for, them, to, bicker, and, be, malicious, to, each, other, children, are, sensitive, from, the, age, of, 1, year, to, differences, in, parental, treatment, and, by, 3, years, they, have, a, sophisticated, grasp, of, family, rules, and, can, evaluate, themselves, in, relation, to, their, siblings, sibling, rivalry, often, continues, throughout, childhood, and, can, be, very, frustrating, and, stressful, to, parents, one, study, found, that, the, age, group, 10, 15, reported, the, highest, level, of, competition, between, siblings, sibling, rivalry, can, continue, into, adulthood, and, sibling, relationships, can, change, dramatically, over, the, years, approximately, one, third, of, adults, describe, their, relationship, with, siblings, as, rivalrous, or, distant, however, rivalry, often, lessens, over, time, and, at, least, 80, of, siblings, over, age, 60, enjoy, close, ties, each, child, in, a, family, competes, to, define, who, they, are, as, persons, and, want, to, show, that, they, are, separate, from, their, siblings, sibling, rivalry, increases, when, children, feel, they, are, getting, unequal, amounts, of, their, parents, attention, where, there, is, stress, in, the, parents, and, children, s, lives, and, where, fighting, is, accepted, by, the, family, as, a, way, to, resolve, conflicts, sigmund, freud, saw, the, sibling, relationship, as, an, extension, of, the, oedipus, complex, where, brothers, were, in, competition, for, their, mother, s, attention, and, sisters, for, their, father, s, evolutionary, psychologists, explain, sibling, rivalry, in, terms, of, parental, investment, and, kin, selection, a, parent, is, inclined, to, spread, resources, equally, among, all, children, in, the, family, but, a, child, wants, most, of, the, resources, for, him, or, herself, jealousy, is, not, a, single, emotion, the, basic, emotions, expressed, in, jealous, interactions, are, fear, anger, relief, sadness, and, anxiety, jealousy, occurs, in, a, social, triangle, of, relationships, which, do, not, require, a, third, person, the, social, triangle, involves, the, relationships, between, the, jealous, individual, and, the, parent, the, relationship, between, the, parent, and, the, rival, and, the, relationship, between, jealous, individual, and, the, rival, first, borns, attachment, to, their, parents, is, directly, related, to, their, jealous, behaviour, in, a, study, by, volling, four, classes, of, children, were, identified, based, on, their, different, responses, of, jealousy, to, new, infant, siblings, and, parent, interactions, regulated, exploration, children, 60, of, children, fall, into, this, category, these, children, closely, watch, their, parents, interact, with, their, newborn, sibling, approach, them, positively, and, sometimes, join, the, interaction, they, show, fewer, behaviour, problems, in, the, months, following, the, new, birth, and, do, not, display, problematic, behaviours, during, the, parent, infant, interaction, these, children, are, considered, secure, as, they, act, how, a, child, would, be, expected, to, act, in, a, familiar, home, setting, with, their, parents, present, as, secure, bases, to, explore, the, environment, approach, avoidant, children, 30, of, children, fall, into, this, category, these, children, observe, parent, infant, interaction, closely, and, are, less, likely, to, approach, the, infant, and, the, parent, they, are, anxious, to, explore, the, new, environment, as, they, tend, to, seek, little, comfort, from, their, parents, anxious, clingy, children, 6, of, children, fell, into, this, category, these, children, have, an, intense, interest, in, parent, infant, interaction, and, a, strong, desire, to, seek, proximity, and, contact, with, the, parent, and, sometimes, intrude, on, parent, child, interaction, disruptive, children, 2, 7, of, children, fall, into, this, category, these, children, are, emotionally, reactive, and, aggressive, they, have, difficulty, regulating, their, negative, emotions, and, may, be, likely, to, externalize, it, as, negative, behaviour, around, the, newborn, children, are, more, jealous, of, the, interactions, between, newborns, and, their, mothers, than, they, are, with, newborns, and, their, fathers, this, is, logical, as, up, until, the, birth, of, the, infant, the, first, born, child, had, the, mother, as, their, primary, care, giver, all, to, themselves, some, research, has, suggested, that, children, display, less, jealous, reactions, over, father, newborn, interactions, because, fathers, tend, to, punish, negative, emotion, and, are, less, tolerant, than, mothers, of, clinginess, and, visible, distress, although, this, is, hard, to, generalize, children, that, have, parents, with, a, better, marital, relationship, are, better, at, regulating, their, jealous, emotions, children, are, more, likely, to, express, jealousy, when, their, parents, are, directing, their, attention, to, the, sibling, as, opposed, to, when, the, parents, are, solely, interacting, with, them, parents, who, are, involved, in, good, marital, communication, help, their, children, cope, adaptively, with, jealousy, they, do, this, by, modelling, problem, solving, and, conflict, resolution, for, their, children, children, are, also, less, likely, to, have, jealous, feelings, when, they, live, in, a, home, in, which, everyone, in, the, family, shares, and, expresses, love, and, happiness, implicit, theories, about, relationships, are, associated, with, the, ways, children, think, of, strategies, to, deal, with, a, new, situation, children, can, fall, into, two, categories, of, implicit, theorizing, they, may, be, malleable, theorists, and, believe, that, they, can, affect, change, on, situations, and, people, alternatively, they, may, be, fixed, theorists, believing, situations, and, people, are, not, changeable, these, implicit, beliefs, determine, both, the, intensity, of, their, jealous, feelings, and, how, long, those, jealous, feelings, last, malleable, theorists, display, engaging, behaviours, like, interacting, with, the, parent, or, sibling, in, an, attempt, to, improve, the, situation, they, tend, to, have, more, intense, and, longer, lasting, feelings, of, jealousy, because, they, spend, more, time, ruminating, on, the, situation, and, constructing, ways, to, make, it, better, fixed, theorists, display, non, engaging, behaviours, for, example, retreating, to, their, room, because, they, believe, none, of, their, actions, will, affect, or, improve, the, situation, they, tend, to, have, less, intense, and, shorter, lasting, feelings, of, jealousy, than, malleable, theorists, older, children, tend, to, be, less, jealous, than, their, younger, sibling, this, is, due, to, their, ability, to, mentally, process, the, social, situation, in, a, way, that, gives, them, more, positive, empathetic, feelings, toward, their, younger, sibling, older, children, are, better, able, to, cope, with, their, jealous, feelings, toward, their, younger, sibling, due, to, their, understanding, of, the, necessary, relationship, between, the, parent, and, younger, sibling, older, children, are, also, better, at, self, regulating, their, emotions, and, are, less, dependent, on, their, caregivers, for, external, regulation, as, opposed, to, their, younger, siblings, younger, siblings, feelings, of, jealousy, are, overpowered, by, feelings, of, anger, the, quality, of, the, relationship, between, the, younger, child, and, the, older, child, is, also, a, factor, in, jealousy, as, the, better, the, relationship, the, less, jealous, feelings, occurred, and, vice, versa, sibling, conflict, is, pervasive, and, often, shrugged, off, as, an, accepted, part, of, sibling, dynamics, in, spite, of, the, broad, variety, of, conflict, that, siblings, are, often, involved, in, sibling, conflicts, can, be, grouped, into, two, broader, categories, the, first, category, is, conflict, about, equality, or, fairness, it, is, not, uncommon, to, see, siblings, who, think, that, their, sibling, is, favored, by, their, teachers, peers, or, especially, their, parents, in, fact, it, is, not, uncommon, to, see, siblings, who, both, think, that, their, parents, favor, the, other, sibling, perceived, inequalities, in, the, division, of, resources, such, as, who, got, a, larger, dessert, also, fall, into, this, category, of, conflict, this, form, of, conflict, seems, to, be, more, prevalent, in, the, younger, sibling, the, second, category, of, conflict, involves, an, invasion, of, a, child, s, perceived, personal, domain, by, their, sibling, an, example, of, this, type, of, conflict, is, when, a, child, enters, their, sibling, s, room, when, they, are, not, welcome, or, when, a, child, crosses, over, into, their, sibling, s, side, of, the, car, in, a, long, road, trip, these, types, of, fights, seem, to, be, more, important, to, older, siblings, due, to, their, larger, desire, for, independence, sibling, warmth, is, a, term, for, the, degree, of, affection, and, companionship, shared, by, siblings, sibling, warmth, seems, to, have, an, effect, on, siblings, higher, sibling, warmth, is, related, to, better, social, skill, and, higher, perceived, social, competence, even, in, cases, where, there, is, a, high, level, of, sibling, conflict, if, there, is, also, a, high, level, of, sibling, warmth, then, social, skills, and, competence, remain, unaffected, the, saying, that, people, fight, like, siblings, shows, just, how, charged, sibling, conflict, can, be, and, how, well, recognized, sibling, squabbles, are, in, spite, of, how, widely, acknowledged, these, squabbles, can, be, sibling, conflict, can, have, several, impacts, on, the, sibling, pair, it, has, been, shown, that, increased, levels, of, sibling, conflict, are, related, to, higher, levels, of, anxiety, and, depression, in, siblings, along, with, lower, levels, of, self, worth, and, lower, levels, of, academic, competence, in, addition, sibling, warmth, is, not, a, protective, factor, for, the, negative, effects, of, anxiety, depression, lack, of, self, worth, and, lower, levels, of, academic, competence, this, means, that, sibling, warmth, does, not, counteract, these, negative, effects, sibling, conflict, is, also, linked, to, an, increase, in, more, risky, behavior, including, smoking, cigarettes, skipping, days, of, school, contact, with, the, police, and, other, behaviors, in, caucasian, sibling, pairs, with, the, exception, of, firstborns, with, younger, brothers, except, for, the, elder, brother, in, this, pair, sibling, conflict, is, positively, correlated, with, risky, behavior, thus, sibling, conflict, may, be, a, risk, factor, for, behavioral, problems, a, study, on, what, the, topic, of, the, fight, was, invasion, of, personal, domain, or, inequality, also, shows, that, the, topic, of, the, fight, may, have, a, result, on, the, effects, of, the, conflict, this, study, showed, that, sibling, conflict, over, personal, domain, were, related, to, lower, levels, of, self, esteem, and, sibling, conflict, over, perceived, inequalities, seem, to, be, more, related, to, depressive, symptoms, however, the, study, also, showed, that, greater, depressive, and, anxious, symptoms, were, also, related, to, more, frequent, sibling, conflict, and, more, intense, sibling, conflict, techniques, used, by, parents, to, manage, their, children, s, conflicts, include, parental, non, intervention, child, centered, parental, intervention, strategies, and, more, rarely, the, encouragement, of, physical, conflict, between, siblings, parental, non, intervention, included, techniques, in, which, the, parent, ignores, the, siblings, conflict, and, lets, them, work, it, out, between, themselves, without, outside, guidance, in, some, cases, this, technique, is, chosen, to, avoid, situations, in, which, the, parent, decides, which, sibling, is, in, the, right, and, may, favor, one, sibling, over, the, other, however, by, following, this, technique, the, parent, may, sacrifice, the, opportunity, to, instruct, their, children, on, how, to, deal, with, conflict, child, centered, parental, interventions, include, techniques, in, which, the, parent, mediates, the, argument, between, the, two, children, and, helps, them, come, to, an, agreement, using, this, technique, parents, may, help, model, how, the, children, can, deal, with, conflicts, in, the, future, however, parents, should, avoid, dictating, the, outcome, to, the, children, and, make, sure, that, they, are, mediating, the, argument, making, suggestions, allowing, the, children, to, decide, the, outcome, this, may, be, especially, important, when, some, of, the, children, have, autism, techniques, in, which, parents, encourage, physical, aggression, between, siblings, may, be, chosen, by, the, parents, to, help, children, deal, with, aggression, in, the, future, however, this, technique, does, not, appear, to, be, effective, as, it, is, linked, to, greater, conflict, levels, between, children, parental, non, intervention, is, also, linked, to, higher, levels, of, sibling, conflict, and, lower, levels, of, sibling, warmth, it, appears, that, child, centered, parental, interventions, have, the, best, effect, on, sibling, s, relationship, with, a, link, to, greater, levels, of, sibling, warmth, and, lower, levels, of, sibling, conflict, studies, on, social, skill, and, personality, differences, between, only, children, and, children, with, siblings, suggest, that, overall, the, presence, of, a, sibling, does, not, have, any, effect, on, the, child, as, an, adult, there, have, always, been, some, differences, between, siblings, especially, different, sex, siblings, often, different, sex, sibling, may, consider, things, to, be, unfair, because, their, brother, or, sister, is, allowed, to, do, certain, things, because, of, their, gender, while, they, get, to, do, something, less, fun, or, just, different, mchale, and, her, colleague, conducted, a, longitudinal, study, using, middle, childhood, aged, children, and, observed, the, way, in, which, the, parents, contributed, to, stereotypical, attitudes, in, their, kids, in, their, study, the, experimenters, analysed, two, different, types, of, families, one, with, the, same, sex, siblings, and, the, other, with, different, sex, siblings, as, well, as, the, children, s, birth, order, the, experiment, was, conducted, using, phone, interviews, in, which, the, experimenters, would, ask, the, children, about, the, activities, they, performed, throughout, their, day, outside, of, school, the, experimenters, found, that, in, the, homes, where, there, were, mixed, gender, kids, and, the, father, held, traditional, values, the, kids, also, held, traditional, values, and, therefore, also, played, gender, based, roles, in, the, home, in, contrast, in, homes, where, the, father, did, not, hold, traditional, values, the, house, chores, were, divided, more, equally, among, his, kids, however, if, fathers, had, two, male, children, the, younger, male, tended, to, help, more, with, household, chores, but, as, he, reached, his, teenage, years, the, younger, child, stopped, being, as, helpful, around, the, house, however, education, may, be, a, confounder, affecting, both, the, father, s, attitude, and, the, siblings, behavior, and, the, mother, s, attitudes, did, not, have, a, noticeable, impact, anthropologist, edvard, westermarck, found, that, children, who, are, brought, up, together, as, siblings, are, desensitized, to, sexual, attraction, to, one, another, later, in, life, this, is, known, as, the, westermarck, effect, it, can, be, seen, in, biological, and, adoptive, families, but, also, in, other, situations, where, children, are, brought, up, in, close, contact, such, as, the, israeli, kibbutz, system, and, the, chinese, shim, pua, marriage
