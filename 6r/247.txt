a, condom, is, a, sheath, shaped, barrier, device, used, during, sexual, intercourse, to, reduce, the, probability, of, pregnancy, or, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, sti, there, are, both, external, condoms, also, called, male, condoms, and, internal, female, condoms, the, external, condom, is, rolled, onto, an, erect, penis, before, intercourse, and, works, by, forming, a, physical, barrier, which, limits, skin, to, skin, contact, exposure, to, fluids, and, blocks, semen, from, entering, the, body, of, a, sexual, partner, external, condoms, are, typically, made, from, latex, and, less, commonly, from, polyurethane, polyisoprene, or, lamb, intestine, external, condoms, have, the, advantages, of, ease, of, use, ease, of, access, and, few, side, effects, individuals, with, latex, allergy, should, use, condoms, made, from, a, material, other, than, latex, such, as, polyurethane, internal, condoms, are, typically, made, from, polyurethane, and, may, be, used, multiple, times, with, proper, use, and, use, at, every, act, of, intercourse, women, whose, partners, use, external, condoms, experience, a, 2, per, year, pregnancy, rate, with, typical, use, the, rate, of, pregnancy, is, 18, per, year, their, use, greatly, decreases, the, risk, of, gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis, hepatitis, b, and, hiv, aids, to, a, lesser, extent, they, also, protect, against, genital, herpes, human, papillomavirus, hpv, and, syphilis, condoms, as, a, method, of, preventing, stis, have, been, used, since, at, least, 1564, rubber, condoms, became, available, in, 1855, followed, by, latex, condoms, in, the, 1920s, it, is, on, the, world, health, organization, s, list, of, essential, medicines, as, of, 2019, globally, around, 21, of, those, using, birth, control, use, the, condom, making, it, the, second, most, common, method, after, female, sterilization, 24, rates, of, condom, use, are, highest, in, east, and, southeast, asia, europe, and, north, america, about, six, to, nine, billion, are, sold, a, year, the, effectiveness, of, condoms, as, of, most, forms, of, contraception, can, be, assessed, two, ways, perfect, use, or, method, effectiveness, rates, only, include, people, who, use, condoms, properly, and, consistently, actual, use, or, typical, use, effectiveness, rates, are, of, all, condom, users, including, those, who, use, condoms, incorrectly, or, do, not, use, condoms, at, every, act, of, intercourse, rates, are, generally, presented, for, the, first, year, of, use, most, commonly, the, pearl, index, is, used, to, calculate, effectiveness, rates, but, some, studies, use, decrement, tables, 141, the, typical, use, pregnancy, rate, among, condom, users, varies, depending, on, the, population, being, studied, ranging, from, 10, to, 18, per, year, the, perfect, use, pregnancy, rate, of, condoms, is, 2, per, year, condoms, may, be, combined, with, other, forms, of, contraception, such, as, spermicide, for, greater, protection, condoms, are, widely, recommended, for, the, prevention, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, they, have, been, shown, to, be, effective, in, reducing, infection, rates, in, both, men, and, women, while, not, perfect, the, condom, is, effective, at, reducing, the, transmission, of, organisms, that, cause, aids, genital, herpes, cervical, cancer, genital, warts, syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and, other, diseases, condoms, are, often, recommended, as, an, adjunct, to, more, effective, birth, control, methods, such, as, iud, in, situations, where, sti, protection, is, also, desired, for, this, reason, condoms, are, frequently, used, by, those, in, the, swinging, community, according, to, a, 2000, report, by, the, national, institutes, of, health, nih, consistent, use, of, latex, condoms, reduces, the, risk, of, hiv, transmission, by, approximately, 85, relative, to, risk, when, unprotected, putting, the, seroconversion, rate, infection, rate, at, 0, 9, per, 100, person, years, with, condom, down, from, 6, 7, per, 100, person, years, analysis, published, in, 2007, from, the, university, of, texas, medical, branch, and, the, world, health, organization, found, similar, risk, reductions, of, 80, 95, the, 2000, nih, review, concluded, that, condom, use, significantly, reduces, the, risk, of, gonorrhea, for, men, a, 2006, study, reports, that, proper, condom, use, decreases, the, risk, of, transmission, of, human, papillomavirus, hpv, to, women, by, approximately, 70, another, study, in, the, same, year, found, consistent, condom, use, was, effective, at, reducing, transmission, of, herpes, simplex, virus, 2, also, known, as, genital, herpes, in, both, men, and, women, although, a, condom, is, effective, in, limiting, exposure, some, disease, transmission, may, occur, even, with, a, condom, infectious, areas, of, the, genitals, especially, when, symptoms, are, present, may, not, be, covered, by, a, condom, and, as, a, result, some, diseases, like, hpv, and, herpes, may, be, transmitted, by, direct, contact, the, primary, effectiveness, issue, with, using, condoms, to, prevent, stis, however, is, inconsistent, use, condoms, may, also, be, useful, in, treating, potentially, precancerous, cervical, changes, exposure, to, human, papillomavirus, even, in, individuals, already, infected, with, the, virus, appears, to, increase, the, risk, of, precancerous, changes, the, use, of, condoms, helps, promote, regression, of, these, changes, in, addition, researchers, in, the, uk, suggest, that, a, hormone, in, semen, can, aggravate, existing, cervical, cancer, condom, use, during, sex, can, prevent, exposure, to, the, hormone, condoms, may, slip, off, the, penis, after, ejaculation, break, due, to, improper, application, or, physical, damage, such, as, tears, caused, when, opening, the, package, or, break, or, slip, due, to, latex, degradation, typically, from, usage, past, the, expiration, date, improper, storage, or, exposure, to, oils, the, rate, of, breakage, is, between, 0, 4, and, 2, 3, while, the, rate, of, slippage, is, between, 0, 6, and, 1, 3, even, if, no, breakage, or, slippage, is, observed, 1, 3, of, women, will, test, positive, for, semen, residue, after, intercourse, with, a, condom, failure, rates, are, higher, for, anal, sex, and, until, 2022, condoms, were, only, approved, by, the, fda, for, vaginal, sex, the, one, male, condom, received, fda, approval, for, anal, sex, on, 23, february, 2022, different, modes, of, condom, failure, result, in, different, levels, of, semen, exposure, if, a, failure, occurs, during, application, the, damaged, condom, may, be, disposed, of, and, a, new, condom, applied, before, intercourse, begins, such, failures, generally, pose, no, risk, to, the, user, one, study, found, that, semen, exposure, from, a, broken, condom, was, about, half, that, of, unprotected, intercourse, semen, exposure, from, a, slipped, condom, was, about, one, fifth, that, of, unprotected, intercourse, standard, condoms, will, fit, almost, any, penis, with, varying, degrees, of, comfort, or, risk, of, slippage, many, condom, manufacturers, offer, snug, or, magnum, sizes, some, manufacturers, also, offer, custom, sized, to, fit, condoms, with, claims, that, they, are, more, reliable, and, offer, improved, sensation, comfort, some, studies, have, associated, larger, penises, and, smaller, condoms, with, increased, breakage, and, decreased, slippage, rates, and, vice, versa, but, other, studies, have, been, inconclusive, it, is, recommended, for, condoms, manufacturers, to, avoid, very, thick, or, very, thin, condoms, because, they, are, both, considered, less, effective, some, authors, encourage, users, to, choose, thinner, condoms, for, greater, durability, sensation, and, comfort, but, others, warn, that, the, thinner, the, condom, the, smaller, the, force, required, to, break, it, experienced, condom, users, are, significantly, less, likely, to, have, a, condom, slip, or, break, compared, to, first, time, users, although, users, who, experience, one, slippage, or, breakage, are, more, likely, to, suffer, a, second, such, failure, an, article, in, population, reports, suggests, that, education, on, condom, use, reduces, behaviors, that, increase, the, risk, of, breakage, and, slippage, a, family, health, international, publication, also, offers, the, view, that, education, can, reduce, the, risk, of, breakage, and, slippage, but, emphasizes, that, more, research, needs, to, be, done, to, determine, all, of, the, causes, of, breakage, and, slippage, among, people, who, intend, condoms, to, be, their, form, of, birth, control, pregnancy, may, occur, when, the, user, has, sex, without, a, condom, the, person, may, have, run, out, of, condoms, or, be, traveling, and, not, have, a, condom, with, them, or, dislike, the, feel, of, condoms, and, decide, to, take, a, chance, this, behavior, is, the, primary, cause, of, typical, use, failure, as, opposed, to, method, or, perfect, use, failure, another, possible, cause, of, condom, failure, is, sabotage, one, motive, is, to, have, a, child, against, a, partner, s, wishes, or, consent, some, commercial, sex, workers, from, nigeria, reported, clients, sabotaging, condoms, in, retaliation, for, being, coerced, into, condom, use, using, a, fine, needle, to, make, several, pinholes, at, the, tip, of, the, condom, is, believed, to, significantly, impact, on, their, effectiveness, 306, 307, cases, of, such, condom, sabotage, have, occurred, the, use, of, latex, condoms, by, people, with, an, allergy, to, latex, can, cause, allergic, symptoms, such, as, skin, irritation, in, people, with, severe, latex, allergies, using, a, latex, condom, can, potentially, be, life, threatening, repeated, use, of, latex, condoms, can, also, cause, the, development, of, a, latex, allergy, in, some, people, irritation, may, also, occur, due, to, spermicides, that, may, be, present, external, condoms, are, usually, packaged, inside, a, foil, or, plastic, wrapper, in, a, rolled, up, form, and, are, designed, to, be, applied, to, the, tip, of, the, penis, and, then, unrolled, over, the, erect, penis, it, is, important, that, the, closed, end, or, the, teat, of, the, condom, is, pinched, when, the, condom, is, placed, on, the, tip, of, the, penis, this, will, ensure, that, air, is, not, trapped, inside, the, condom, which, could, cause, it, to, burst, during, intercourse, in, addition, this, leaves, space, for, the, semen, to, collect, which, reduces, the, risk, of, it, being, forced, out, of, the, base, of, the, device, most, condoms, have, a, teat, end, for, this, purpose, soon, after, ejaculating, the, male, should, withdraw, from, his, partner, s, body, the, condom, should, then, be, carefully, removed, from, the, penis, away, from, the, other, partner, it, is, recommended, that, the, condom, be, wrapped, in, tissue, or, tied, in, a, knot, then, disposed, of, in, a, trash, receptacle, condoms, are, used, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, pregnancy, during, intercourse, and, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, contracting, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, condoms, are, also, used, during, fellatio, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, contracting, stis, some, couples, find, that, putting, on, a, condom, interrupts, sex, although, others, incorporate, condom, application, as, part, of, their, foreplay, some, men, and, women, find, the, physical, barrier, of, a, condom, dulls, sensation, advantages, of, dulled, sensation, can, include, prolonged, erection, and, delayed, ejaculation, disadvantages, might, include, a, loss, of, some, sexual, excitement, advocates, of, condom, use, also, cite, their, advantages, of, being, inexpensive, easy, to, use, and, having, few, side, effects, in, 2012, proponents, gathered, 372, 000, voter, signatures, through, a, citizens, initiative, in, los, angeles, county, to, put, measure, b, on, the, 2012, ballot, as, a, result, measure, b, a, law, requiring, the, use, of, condoms, in, the, production, of, pornographic, films, was, passed, this, requirement, has, received, much, criticism, and, is, said, by, some, to, be, counter, productive, merely, forcing, companies, that, make, pornographic, films, to, relocate, to, other, places, without, this, requirement, producers, claim, that, condom, use, depresses, sales, condoms, are, often, used, in, sex, education, programs, because, they, have, the, capability, to, reduce, the, chances, of, pregnancy, and, the, spread, of, some, sexually, transmitted, infections, when, used, correctly, a, recent, american, psychological, association, apa, press, release, supported, the, inclusion, of, information, about, condoms, in, sex, education, saying, comprehensive, sexuality, education, programs, discuss, the, appropriate, use, of, condoms, and, promote, condom, use, for, those, who, are, sexually, active, in, the, united, states, teaching, about, condoms, in, public, schools, is, opposed, by, some, religious, organizations, planned, parenthood, which, advocates, family, planning, and, sex, education, argues, that, no, studies, have, shown, abstinence, only, programs, to, result, in, delayed, intercourse, and, cites, surveys, showing, that, 76, of, american, parents, want, their, children, to, receive, comprehensive, sexuality, education, including, condom, use, common, procedures, in, infertility, treatment, such, as, semen, analysis, and, intrauterine, insemination, iui, require, collection, of, semen, samples, these, are, most, commonly, obtained, through, masturbation, but, an, alternative, to, masturbation, is, use, of, a, special, collection, condom, to, collect, semen, during, sexual, intercourse, collection, condoms, are, made, from, silicone, or, polyurethane, as, latex, is, somewhat, harmful, to, sperm, some, religions, prohibit, masturbation, entirely, also, compared, with, samples, obtained, from, masturbation, semen, samples, from, collection, condoms, have, higher, total, sperm, counts, sperm, motility, and, percentage, of, sperm, with, normal, morphology, for, this, reason, they, are, believed, to, give, more, accurate, results, when, used, for, semen, analysis, and, to, improve, the, chances, of, pregnancy, when, used, in, procedures, such, as, intracervical, or, intrauterine, insemination, adherents, of, religions, that, prohibit, contraception, such, as, catholicism, may, use, collection, condoms, with, holes, pricked, in, them, 306, 307, for, fertility, treatments, a, collection, condom, may, be, used, to, collect, semen, during, sexual, intercourse, where, the, semen, is, provided, by, the, woman, s, partner, private, sperm, donors, may, also, use, a, collection, condom, to, obtain, samples, through, masturbation, or, by, sexual, intercourse, with, a, partner, and, will, transfer, the, ejaculate, from, the, collection, condom, to, a, specially, designed, container, the, sperm, is, transported, in, such, containers, in, the, case, of, a, donor, to, a, recipient, woman, to, be, used, for, insemination, and, in, the, case, of, a, woman, s, partner, to, a, fertility, clinic, for, processing, and, use, however, transportation, may, reduce, the, fecundity, of, the, sperm, collection, condoms, may, also, be, used, where, semen, is, produced, at, a, sperm, bank, or, fertility, clinic, condom, therapy, is, sometimes, prescribed, to, infertile, couples, when, the, female, has, high, levels, of, antisperm, antibodies, the, theory, is, that, preventing, exposure, to, her, partner, s, semen, will, lower, her, level, of, antisperm, antibodies, and, thus, increase, her, chances, of, pregnancy, when, condom, therapy, is, discontinued, however, condom, therapy, has, not, been, shown, to, increase, subsequent, pregnancy, rates, condoms, excel, as, multipurpose, containers, and, barriers, because, they, are, waterproof, elastic, durable, and, for, military, and, espionage, uses, will, not, arouse, suspicion, if, found, ongoing, military, utilization, began, during, world, war, ii, and, includes, covering, the, muzzles, of, rifle, barrels, to, prevent, fouling, the, waterproofing, of, firing, assemblies, in, underwater, demolitions, and, storage, of, corrosive, materials, and, garrotes, by, paramilitary, agencies, condoms, have, also, been, used, to, smuggle, alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and, other, drugs, across, borders, and, into, prisons, by, filling, the, condom, with, drugs, tying, it, in, a, knot, and, then, either, swallowing, it, or, inserting, it, into, the, rectum, these, methods, are, very, dangerous, and, potentially, lethal, if, the, condom, breaks, the, drugs, inside, become, absorbed, into, the, bloodstream, and, can, cause, an, overdose, medically, condoms, can, be, used, to, cover, endovaginal, ultrasound, probes, or, in, field, chest, needle, decompressions, they, can, be, used, to, make, a, one, way, valve, condoms, have, also, been, used, to, protect, scientific, samples, from, the, environment, and, to, waterproof, microphones, for, underwater, recording, most, condoms, have, a, reservoir, tip, or, teat, end, making, it, easier, to, accommodate, the, man, s, ejaculate, condoms, come, in, different, sizes, and, shapes, they, also, come, in, a, variety, of, surfaces, intended, to, stimulate, the, user, s, partner, condoms, are, usually, supplied, with, a, lubricant, coating, to, facilitate, penetration, while, flavored, condoms, are, principally, used, for, oral, sex, as, mentioned, above, most, condoms, are, made, of, latex, but, polyurethane, and, lambskin, condoms, also, exist, external, condoms, have, a, tight, ring, to, form, a, seal, around, the, penis, while, internal, condoms, usually, have, a, large, stiff, ring, to, prevent, them, from, slipping, into, the, body, orifice, the, female, health, company, produced, an, internal, condom, that, was, initially, made, of, polyurethane, but, newer, versions, are, made, of, nitrile, rubber, medtech, products, produces, an, internal, condom, made, of, latex, latex, has, outstanding, elastic, properties, its, tensile, strength, exceeds, 30, mpa, and, latex, condoms, may, be, stretched, in, excess, of, 800, before, breaking, in, 1990, the, iso, set, standards, for, condom, production, iso, 4074, natural, latex, rubber, condoms, and, the, eu, followed, suit, with, its, cen, standard, directive, 93, 42, eec, concerning, medical, devices, every, latex, condom, is, tested, for, holes, with, an, electric, current, if, the, condom, passes, it, is, rolled, and, packaged, in, addition, a, portion, of, each, batch, of, condoms, is, subject, to, water, leak, and, air, burst, testing, while, the, advantages, of, latex, have, made, it, the, most, popular, condom, material, it, does, have, some, drawbacks, latex, condoms, are, damaged, when, used, with, oil, based, substances, as, lubricants, such, as, petroleum, jelly, cooking, oil, baby, oil, mineral, oil, skin, lotions, suntan, lotions, cold, creams, butter, or, margarine, contact, with, oil, makes, latex, condoms, more, likely, to, break, or, slip, off, due, to, loss, of, elasticity, caused, by, the, oils, additionally, latex, allergy, precludes, use, of, latex, condoms, and, is, one, of, the, principal, reasons, for, the, use, of, other, materials, in, may, 2009, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, granted, approval, for, the, production, of, condoms, composed, of, vytex, latex, that, has, been, treated, to, remove, 90, of, the, proteins, responsible, for, allergic, reactions, an, allergen, free, condom, made, of, synthetic, latex, polyisoprene, is, also, available, the, most, common, non, latex, condoms, are, made, from, polyurethane, condoms, may, also, be, made, from, other, synthetic, materials, such, as, at, 10, resin, and, most, polyisoprene, polyurethane, condoms, tend, to, be, the, same, width, and, thickness, as, latex, condoms, with, most, polyurethane, condoms, between, 0, 04, mm, and, 0, 07, mm, thick, polyurethane, can, be, considered, better, than, latex, in, several, ways, it, conducts, heat, better, than, latex, is, not, as, sensitive, to, temperature, and, ultraviolet, light, and, so, has, less, rigid, storage, requirements, and, a, longer, shelf, life, can, be, used, with, oil, based, lubricants, is, less, allergenic, than, latex, and, does, not, have, an, odor, polyurethane, condoms, have, gained, fda, approval, for, sale, in, the, united, states, as, an, effective, method, of, contraception, and, hiv, prevention, and, under, laboratory, conditions, have, been, shown, to, be, just, as, effective, as, latex, for, these, purposes, however, polyurethane, condoms, are, less, elastic, than, latex, ones, and, may, be, more, likely, to, slip, or, break, than, latex, lose, their, shape, or, bunch, up, more, than, latex, and, are, more, expensive, polyisoprene, is, a, synthetic, version, of, natural, rubber, latex, while, significantly, more, expensive, it, has, the, advantages, of, latex, such, as, being, softer, and, more, elastic, than, polyurethane, condoms, without, the, protein, which, is, responsible, for, latex, allergies, unlike, polyurethane, condoms, they, cannot, be, used, with, an, oil, based, lubricant, condoms, made, from, sheep, intestines, labeled, lambskin, are, also, available, although, they, are, generally, effective, as, a, contraceptive, by, blocking, sperm, studies, have, found, that, they, are, less, effective, than, latex, in, preventing, the, transmission, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, because, of, pores, in, the, material, this, is, because, intestines, by, their, nature, are, porous, permeable, membranes, and, while, sperm, are, too, large, to, pass, through, the, pores, viruses, such, as, hiv, herpes, and, genital, warts, are, small, enough, to, pass, as, a, result, of, laboratory, data, on, condom, porosity, in, 1989, the, fda, began, requiring, lambskin, condom, manufacturers, to, indicate, that, the, products, were, not, to, be, used, for, the, prevention, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, the, fda, cautions, that, while, lambskin, condoms, provide, good, birth, control, and, a, varying, degree, of, protection, against, some, but, not, all, sexually, transmitted, diseases, people, do, not, know, what, stis, a, partner, might, have, and, thus, cannot, assume, that, a, lambskin, condom, will, protect, them, while, lambskin, condoms, avoid, triggering, latex, allergies, polyurethane, condoms, do, as, well, while, also, protecting, more, reliably, against, stis, as, slaughter, by, products, lambskin, condoms, are, also, not, vegetarian, pharmacist, advice, prepared, by, the, canadian, pharmaceutical, journal, says, that, lambskin, condoms, are, generally, not, recommended, due, to, limited, sti, prevention, an, article, in, adolescent, medicine, advises, that, they, should, be, used, only, for, pregnancy, prevention, some, latex, condoms, are, lubricated, at, the, manufacturer, with, a, small, amount, of, a, nonoxynol, 9, a, spermicidal, chemical, according, to, consumer, reports, condoms, lubricated, with, spermicide, have, no, additional, benefit, in, preventing, pregnancy, have, a, shorter, shelf, life, and, may, cause, urinary, tract, infections, in, women, in, contrast, application, of, separately, packaged, spermicide, is, believed, to, increase, the, contraceptive, efficacy, of, condoms, nonoxynol, 9, was, once, believed, to, offer, additional, protection, against, stis, including, hiv, but, recent, studies, have, shown, that, with, frequent, use, nonoxynol, 9, may, increase, the, risk, of, hiv, transmission, the, world, health, organization, says, that, spermicidally, lubricated, condoms, should, no, longer, be, promoted, however, it, recommends, using, a, nonoxynol, 9, lubricated, condom, over, no, condom, at, all, as, of, 2005, nine, condom, manufacturers, have, stopped, manufacturing, condoms, with, nonoxynol, 9, and, planned, parenthood, has, discontinued, the, distribution, of, condoms, so, lubricated, textured, condoms, include, studded, and, ribbed, condoms, which, can, provide, extra, sensations, to, both, partners, the, studs, or, ribs, can, be, located, on, the, inside, outside, or, both, alternatively, they, are, located, in, specific, sections, to, provide, directed, stimulation, to, either, the, g, spot, or, frenulum, many, textured, condoms, which, advertise, mutual, pleasure, also, are, bulb, shaped, at, the, top, to, provide, extra, stimulation, to, the, penis, some, women, experience, irritation, during, vaginal, intercourse, with, studded, condoms, the, anti, rape, condom, is, another, variation, designed, to, be, worn, by, women, it, is, designed, to, cause, pain, to, the, attacker, hopefully, allowing, the, victim, a, chance, to, escape, a, collection, condom, is, used, to, collect, semen, for, fertility, treatments, or, sperm, analysis, these, condoms, are, designed, to, maximize, sperm, life, in, february, 2022, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, approved, the, first, condoms, specifically, indicated, to, help, reduce, transmission, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, during, anal, intercourse, the, prevalence, of, condom, use, varies, greatly, between, countries, most, surveys, of, contraceptive, use, are, among, married, women, or, women, in, informal, unions, japan, has, the, highest, rate, of, condom, usage, in, the, world, in, that, country, condoms, account, for, almost, 80, of, contraceptive, use, by, married, women, on, average, in, developed, countries, condoms, are, the, most, popular, method, of, birth, control, 28, of, married, contraceptive, users, rely, on, condoms, in, the, average, less, developed, country, condoms, are, less, common, only, 6, 8, of, married, contraceptive, users, choose, condoms, whether, condoms, were, used, in, ancient, civilizations, is, debated, by, archaeologists, and, historians, 11, in, ancient, egypt, greece, and, rome, pregnancy, prevention, was, generally, seen, as, a, woman, s, responsibility, and, the, only, well, documented, contraception, methods, were, female, controlled, devices, 17, 23, in, asia, before, the, 15th, century, some, use, of, glans, condoms, devices, covering, only, the, head, of, the, penis, is, recorded, condoms, seem, to, have, been, used, for, contraception, and, to, have, been, known, only, by, members, of, the, upper, classes, in, china, glans, condoms, may, have, been, made, of, oiled, silk, paper, or, of, lamb,

treatise, on, syphilis, 51, 54, 5, the, earliest, documented, strain, of, syphilis, first, appearing, in, europe, in, a, 1490s, outbreak, caused, severe, symptoms, and, often, death, within, a, few, months, of, contracting, the, disease, falloppio, s, treatise, is, the, earliest, uncontested, description, of, condom, use, it, describes, linen, sheaths, soaked, in, a, chemical, solution, and, allowed, to, dry, before, use, the, cloths, he, described, were, sized, to, cover, the, glans, of, the, penis, and, were, held, on, with, a, ribbon, 51, 54, 5, falloppio, claimed, that, an, experimental, trial, of, the, linen, sheath, demonstrated, protection, against, syphilis, after, this, the, use, of, penis, coverings, to, protect, from, disease, is, described, in, a, wide, variety, of, literature, throughout, europe, the, first, indication, that, these, devices, were, used, for, birth, control, rather, than, disease, prevention, is, the, 1605, theological, publication, de, iustitia, et, iure, on, justice, and, law, by, catholic, theologian, leonardus, lessius, who, condemned, them, as, immoral, 56, in, 1666, the, english, birth, rate, commission, attributed, a, recent, downward, fertility, rate, to, use, of, condons, the, first, documented, use, of, that, word, or, any, similar, spelling, 66, 8, other, early, spellings, include, condam, and, quondam, from, which, the, italian, derivation, guantone, has, been, suggested, from, guanto, a, glove, in, addition, to, linen, condoms, during, the, renaissance, were, made, out, of, intestines, and, bladder, in, the, late, 16th, century, dutch, traders, introduced, condoms, made, from, fine, leather, to, japan, unlike, the, horn, condoms, used, previously, these, leather, condoms, covered, the, entire, penis, 61, casanova, in, the, 18th, century, was, one, of, the, first, reported, using, assurance, caps, to, prevent, impregnating, his, mistresses, from, at, least, the, 18th, century, condom, use, was, opposed, in, some, legal, religious, and, medical, circles, for, essentially, the, same, reasons, that, are, given, today, condoms, reduce, the, likelihood, of, pregnancy, which, some, thought, immoral, or, undesirable, for, the, nation, they, do, not, provide, full, protection, against, sexually, transmitted, infections, while, belief, in, their, protective, powers, was, thought, to, encourage, sexual, promiscuity, and, they, are, not, used, consistently, due, to, inconvenience, expense, or, loss, of, sensation, 73, 86, 8, 92, despite, some, opposition, the, condom, market, grew, rapidly, in, the, 18th, century, condoms, were, available, in, a, variety, of, qualities, and, sizes, made, from, either, linen, treated, with, chemicals, or, skin, bladder, or, intestine, softened, by, treatment, with, sulfur, and, lye, 94, 5, they, were, sold, at, pubs, barbershops, chemist, shops, open, air, markets, and, at, the, theater, throughout, europe, and, russia, 90, 2, 97, 104, they, later, spread, to, america, although, in, every, place, there, were, generally, used, only, by, the, middle, and, upper, classes, due, to, both, expense, and, lack, of, sex, education, 116, 21, the, early, 19th, century, saw, contraceptives, promoted, to, the, poorer, classes, for, the, first, time, writers, on, contraception, tended, to, prefer, other, birth, control, methods, to, the, condom, by, the, late, 19th, century, many, feminists, expressed, distrust, of, the, condom, as, a, contraceptive, as, its, use, was, controlled, and, decided, upon, by, men, alone, they, advocated, instead, for, methods, controlled, by, women, such, as, diaphragms, and, spermicidal, douches, 152, 3, other, writers, cited, both, the, expense, of, condoms, and, their, unreliability, they, were, often, riddled, with, holes, and, often, fell, off, or, tore, still, they, discussed, condoms, as, a, good, option, for, some, and, the, only, contraceptive, that, protects, from, disease, 88, 90, 125, 129, 30, many, countries, passed, laws, impeding, the, manufacture, and, promotion, of, contraceptives, 144, 163, 4, 168, 71, 193, in, spite, of, these, restrictions, condoms, were, promoted, by, traveling, lecturers, and, in, newspaper, advertisements, using, euphemisms, in, places, where, such, ads, were, illegal, 127, 130, 2, 138, 146, 7, instructions, on, how, to, make, condoms, at, home, were, distributed, in, the, united, states, and, europe, 126, 136, despite, social, and, legal, opposition, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, condom, was, the, western, world, s, most, popular, birth, control, method, 173, 4, beginning, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, american, rates, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, skyrocketed, causes, cited, by, historians, include, the, effects, of, the, american, civil, war, and, the, ignorance, of, prevention, methods, promoted, by, the, comstock, laws, 137, 8, 159, to, fight, the, growing, epidemic, sex, education, classes, were, introduced, to, public, schools, for, the, first, time, teaching, about, venereal, diseases, and, how, they, were, transmitted, they, generally, taught, abstinence, was, the, only, way, to, avoid, sexually, transmitted, infections, 179, 80, condoms, were, not, promoted, for, disease, prevention, because, the, medical, community, and, moral, watchdogs, considered, stis, to, be, punishment, for, sexual, misbehavior, the, stigma, against, people, with, these, diseases, was, so, significant, that, many, hospitals, refused, to, treat, people, with, syphilis, 176, the, german, military, was, the, first, to, promote, condom, use, among, its, soldiers, in, the, later, 19th, century, 169, 181, early, 20th, century, experiments, by, the, american, military, concluded, that, providing, condoms, to, soldiers, significantly, lowered, rates, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, 180, 3, during, world, war, i, the, united, states, and, at, the, beginning, of, the, war, only, britain, were, the, only, countries, with, soldiers, in, europe, who, did, not, provide, condoms, and, promote, their, use, 187, 90, in, the, decades, after, world, war, i, there, remained, social, and, legal, obstacles, to, condom, use, throughout, the, u, s, and, europe, 208, 10, founder, of, psychoanalysis, sigmund, freud, opposed, all, methods, of, birth, control, because, their, failure, rates, were, too, high, freud, was, especially, opposed, to, the, condom, because, he, thought, it, cut, down, on, sexual, pleasure, some, feminists, continued, to, oppose, male, controlled, contraceptives, such, as, condoms, in, 1920, the, church, of, england, s, lambeth, conference, condemned, all, unnatural, means, of, conception, avoidance, the, bishop, of, london, arthur, winnington, ingram, complained, of, the, huge, number, of, condoms, discarded, in, alleyways, and, parks, especially, after, weekends, and, holidays, 211, 2, however, european, militaries, continued, to, provide, condoms, to, their, members, for, disease, protection, even, in, countries, where, they, were, illegal, for, the, general, population, 213, 4, through, the, 1920s, catchy, names, and, slick, packaging, became, an, increasingly, important, marketing, technique, for, many, consumer, items, including, condoms, and, cigarettes, 197, quality, testing, became, more, common, involving, filling, each, condom, with, air, followed, by, one, of, several, methods, intended, to, detect, loss, of, pressure, 204, 206, 221, 2, worldwide, condom, sales, doubled, in, the, 1920s, 210, in, 1839, charles, goodyear, discovered, a, way, of, processing, natural, rubber, which, is, too, stiff, when, cold, and, too, soft, when, warm, in, such, a, way, as, to, make, it, elastic, this, proved, to, have, advantages, for, the, manufacture, of, condoms, unlike, the, sheep, s, gut, condoms, they, could, stretch, and, did, not, tear, quickly, when, used, the, rubber, vulcanization, process, was, patented, by, goodyear, in, 1844, the, first, rubber, condom, was, produced, in, 1855, the, earliest, rubber, condoms, had, a, seam, and, were, as, thick, as, a, bicycle, inner, tube, besides, this, type, small, rubber, condoms, covering, only, the, glans, were, often, used, in, england, and, the, united, states, there, was, more, risk, of, losing, them, and, if, the, rubber, ring, was, too, tight, it, would, constrict, the, penis, this, type, of, condom, was, the, original, capote, french, for, condom, perhaps, because, of, its, resemblance, to, a, woman, s, bonnet, worn, at, that, time, also, called, a, capote, for, many, decades, rubber, condoms, were, manufactured, by, wrapping, strips, of, raw, rubber, around, penis, shaped, molds, then, dipping, the, wrapped, molds, in, a, chemical, solution, to, cure, the, rubber, 148, in, 1912, polish, born, inventor, julius, fromm, developed, a, new, improved, manufacturing, technique, for, condoms, dipping, glass, molds, into, a, raw, rubber, solution, called, cement, dipping, this, method, required, adding, gasoline, or, benzene, to, the, rubber, to, make, it, liquid, 200, around, 1920, patent, lawyer, and, vice, president, of, the, united, states, rubber, company, ernest, hopkinson, invented, a, new, technique, of, converting, latex, into, rubber, without, a, coagulant, demulsifier, which, featured, using, water, as, a, solvent, and, warm, air, to, dry, the, solution, as, well, as, optionally, preserving, liquid, latex, with, ammonia, condoms, made, this, way, commonly, called, latex, ones, required, less, labor, to, produce, than, cement, dipped, rubber, condoms, which, had, to, be, smoothed, by, rubbing, and, trimming, the, use, of, water, to, suspend, the, rubber, instead, of, gasoline, and, benzene, eliminated, the, fire, hazard, previously, associated, with, all, condom, factories, latex, condoms, also, performed, better, for, the, consumer, they, were, stronger, and, thinner, than, rubber, condoms, and, had, a, shelf, life, of, five, years, compared, to, three, months, for, rubber, 199, 200, until, the, twenties, all, condoms, were, individually, hand, dipped, by, semi, skilled, workers, throughout, the, decade, of, the, 1920s, advances, in, the, automation, of, the, condom, assembly, line, were, made, the, first, fully, automated, line, was, patented, in, 1930, major, condom, manufacturers, bought, or, leased, conveyor, systems, and, small, manufacturers, were, driven, out, of, business, 201, 3, the, skin, condom, now, significantly, more, expensive, than, the, latex, variety, became, restricted, to, a, niche, high, end, market, 220, in, 1930, the, anglican, church, s, lambeth, conference, sanctioned, the, use, of, birth, control, by, married, couples, in, 1931, the, federal, council, of, churches, in, the, u, s, issued, a, similar, statement, 227, the, roman, catholic, church, responded, by, issuing, the, encyclical, casti, connubii, affirming, its, opposition, to, all, contraceptives, a, stance, it, has, never, reversed, 228, 9, in, the, 1930s, legal, restrictions, on, condoms, began, to, be, relaxed, 216, 226, 234, however, during, this, period, fascist, italy, and, nazi, germany, increased, restrictions, on, condoms, limited, sales, as, disease, preventatives, were, still, allowed, 252, 254, 5, during, the, depression, condom, lines, by, schmid, gained, in, popularity, schmid, still, used, the, cement, dipping, method, of, manufacture, which, had, two, advantages, over, the, latex, variety, firstly, cement, dipped, condoms, could, be, safely, used, with, oil, based, lubricants, secondly, while, less, comfortable, these, older, style, rubber, condoms, could, be, reused, and, so, were, more, economical, a, valued, feature, in, hard, times, 217, 9, more, attention, was, brought, to, quality, issues, in, the, 1930s, and, the, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, began, to, regulate, the, quality, of, condoms, sold, in, the, united, states, 223, 5, throughout, world, war, ii, condoms, were, not, only, distributed, to, male, u, s, military, members, but, also, heavily, promoted, with, films, posters, and, lectures, 236, 8, 259, european, and, asian, militaries, on, both, sides, of, the, conflict, also, provided, condoms, to, their, troops, throughout, the, war, even, germany, which, outlawed, all, civilian, use, of, condoms, in, 1941, 252, 4, 257, 8, in, part, because, condoms, were, readily, available, soldiers, found, a, number, of, non, sexual, uses, for, the, devices, many, of, which, continue, to, this, day, after, the, war, condom, sales, continued, to, grow, from, 1955, to, 1965, 42, of, americans, of, reproductive, age, relied, on, condoms, for, birth, control, in, britain, from, 1950, to, 1960, 60, of, married, couples, used, condoms, the, birth, control, pill, became, the, world, s, most, popular, method, of, birth, control, in, the, years, after, its, 1960, d, but, but, condoms, remained, a, strong, second, the, u, s, agency, for, international, development, pushed, condom, use, in, developing, countries, to, help, solve, the, world, population, crises, by, 1970, hundreds, of, millions, of, condoms, were, being, used, each, year, in, india, alone, 267, 9, 272, 5, this, number, has, grown, in, recent, decades, in, 2004, the, government, of, india, purchased, 1, 9, billion, condoms, for, distribution, at, family, planning, clinics, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, quality, regulations, tightened, and, more, legal, barriers, to, condom, use, were, removed, 276, 9, in, ireland, legal, condom, sales, were, allowed, for, the, first, time, in, 1978, 329, 30, advertising, however, was, one, area, that, continued, to, have, legal, restrictions, in, the, late, 1950s, the, american, national, association, of, broadcasters, banned, condom, advertisements, from, national, television, this, policy, remained, in, place, until, 1979, 273, 4, 285, after, it, was, discovered, in, the, early, 1980s, that, aids, can, be, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, the, use, of, condoms, was, encouraged, to, prevent, transmission, of, hiv, despite, opposition, by, some, political, religious, and, other, figures, national, condom, promotion, campaigns, occurred, in, the, u, s, and, europe, 299, 301, 306, 7, 312, 8, these, campaigns, increased, condom, use, significantly, 309, 17, due, to, increased, demand, and, greater, social, acceptance, condoms, began, to, be, sold, in, a, wider, variety, of, retail, outlets, including, in, supermarkets, and, in, discount, department, stores, such, as, walmart, 305, condom, sales, increased, every, year, until, 1994, when, media, attention, to, the, aids, pandemic, began, to, decline, 303, 4, the, phenomenon, of, decreasing, use, of, condoms, as, disease, preventatives, has, been, called, prevention, fatigue, or, condom, fatigue, observers, have, cited, condom, fatigue, in, both, europe, and, north, america, as, one, response, manufacturers, have, changed, the, tone, of, their, advertisements, from, scary, to, humorous, 303, 4, new, developments, continued, to, occur, in, the, condom, market, with, the, first, polyurethane, condom, branded, avanti, and, produced, by, the, manufacturer, of, durex, introduced, in, the, 1990s, 32, 5, worldwide, condom, use, is, expected, to, continue, to, grow, one, study, predicted, that, developing, nations, would, need, 18, 6, billion, condoms, by, 2015, 342, as, of, september, 2013, condoms, are, available, inside, prisons, in, canada, most, of, the, european, union, australia, brazil, indonesia, south, africa, and, the, us, states, of, vermont, on, 17, september, 2013, the, californian, senate, approved, a, bill, for, condom, distribution, inside, the, state, s, prisons, but, the, bill, was, not, yet, law, at, the, time, of, approval, the, global, condom, market, was, estimated, at, us, 9, 2, billion, in, 2020, the, term, condom, first, appears, in, the, early, 18th, century, early, forms, include, condum, 1706, and, 1717, condon, 1708, and, cundum, 1744, the, word, s, etymology, is, unknown, in, popular, tradition, the, invention, and, naming, of, the, condom, came, to, be, attributed, to, an, associate, of, england, s, king, charles, ii, one, dr, condom, or, earl, of, condom, there, is, however, no, evidence, of, the, existence, of, such, a, person, and, condoms, had, been, used, for, over, one, hundred, years, before, king, charles, ii, acceded, to, the, throne, in, 1660, 54, 68, a, variety, of, unproven, latin, etymologies, have, been, proposed, including, condon, receptacle, condamina, house, and, cumdum, scabbard, or, case, 70, 1, it, has, also, been, speculated, to, be, from, the, italian, word, guantone, derived, from, guanto, meaning, glove, william, e, kruck, wrote, an, article, in, 1981, concluding, that, as, for, the, word, condom, i, need, state, only, that, its, origin, remains, completely, unknown, and, there, ends, this, search, for, an, etymology, modern, dictionaries, may, also, list, the, etymology, as, unknown, other, terms, are, also, commonly, used, to, describe, condoms, in, north, america, condoms, are, also, commonly, known, as, prophylactics, or, rubbers, in, britain, they, may, be, called, french, letters, or, rubber, johnnies, additionally, condoms, may, be, referred, to, using, the, manufacturer, s, name, some, moral, and, scientific, criticism, of, condoms, exists, despite, the, many, benefits, of, condoms, agreed, on, by, scientific, consensus, and, sexual, health, experts, condom, usage, is, typically, recommended, for, new, couples, who, have, yet, to, develop, full, trust, in, their, partner, with, regard, to, stis, established, couples, on, the, other, hand, have, few, concerns, about, stis, and, can, use, other, methods, of, birth, control, such, as, the, pill, which, does, not, act, as, a, barrier, to, intimate, sexual, contact, note, that, the, polar, debate, with, regard, to, condom, usage, is, attenuated, by, the, target, group, the, argument, is, directed, notably, the, age, category, and, stable, partner, question, are, factors, as, well, as, the, distinction, between, heterosexual, and, homosexuals, who, have, different, kinds, of, sex, and, have, different, risk, consequences, and, factors, among, the, prime, objections, to, condom, usage, is, the, blocking, of, erotic, sensation, or, the, intimacy, that, barrier, free, sex, provides, as, the, condom, is, held, tightly, to, the, skin, of, the, penis, it, diminishes, the, delivery, of, stimulation, through, rubbing, and, friction, condom, proponents, claim, this, has, the, benefit, of, making, sex, last, longer, by, diminishing, sensation, and, delaying, male, ejaculation, those, who, promote, condom, free, heterosexual, sex, slang, bareback, claim, that, the, condom, puts, a, barrier, between, partners, diminishing, what, is, normally, a, highly, sensual, intimate, and, spiritual, connection, between, partners, the, united, church, of, christ, ucc, a, reformed, denomination, of, the, congregationalist, tradition, promotes, the, distribution, of, condoms, in, churches, and, faith, based, educational, settings, michael, shuenemeyer, a, ucc, minister, has, stated, that, the, practice, of, safer, sex, is, a, matter, of, life, and, death, people, of, faith, make, condoms, available, because, we, have, chosen, life, so, that, we, and, our, children, may, live, on, the, other, hand, the, roman, catholic, church, opposes, all, kinds, of, sexual, acts, outside, of, marriage, as, well, as, any, sexual, act, in, which, the, chance, of, successful, conception, has, been, reduced, by, direct, and, intentional, acts, for, example, surgery, to, prevent, conception, or, foreign, objects, for, example, condoms, the, use, of, condoms, to, prevent, sti, transmission, is, not, specifically, addressed, by, catholic, doctrine, and, is, currently, a, topic, of, debate, among, theologians, and, high, ranking, catholic, authorities, a, few, such, as, belgian, cardinal, godfried, danneels, believe, the, catholic, church, should, actively, support, condoms, used, to, prevent, disease, especially, serious, diseases, such, as, aids, however, the, majority, view, including, all, statements, from, the, vatican, is, that, condom, promotion, programs, encourage, promiscuity, thereby, actually, increasing, sti, transmission, this, view, was, most, recently, reiterated, in, 2009, by, pope, benedict, xvi, the, roman, catholic, church, is, the, largest, organized, body, of, any, world, religion, the, church, has, hundreds, of, programs, dedicated, to, fighting, the, aids, epidemic, in, africa, but, its, opposition, to, condom, use, in, these, programs, has, been, highly, controversial, in, a, november, 2011, interview, pope, benedict, xvi, discussed, for, the, first, time, the, use, of, condoms, to, prevent, sti, transmission, he, said, that, the, use, of, a, condom, can, be, justified, in, a, few, individual, cases, if, the, purpose, is, to, reduce, the, risk, of, an, hiv, infection, he, gave, as, an, example, male, prostitutes, there, was, some, confusion, at, first, whether, the, statement, applied, only, to, homosexual, prostitutes, and, thus, not, to, heterosexual, intercourse, at, all, however, federico, lombardi, spokesman, for, the, vatican, clarified, that, it, applied, to, heterosexual, and, transsexual, prostitutes, whether, male, or, female, as, well, he, did, however, also, clarify, that, the, vatican, s, principles, on, sexuality, and, contraception, had, not, been, changed, more, generally, some, scientific, researchers, have, expressed, objective, concern, over, certain, ingredients, sometimes, added, to, condoms, notably, talc, and, nitrosamines, dry, dusting, powders, are, applied, to, latex, condoms, before, packaging, to, prevent, the, condom, from, sticking, to, itself, when, rolled, up, previously, talc, was, used, by, most, manufacturers, but, cornstarch, is, currently, the, most, popular, dusting, powder, although, rare, during, normal, use, talc, is, known, to, be, potentially, irritant, to, mucous, membranes, such, as, in, the, vagina, cornstarch, is, generally, believed, to, be, safe, however, some, researchers, have, raised, concerns, over, its, use, as, well, nitrosamines, which, are, potentially, carcinogenic, in, humans, are, believed, to, be, present, in, a, substance, used, to, improve, elasticity, in, latex, condoms, a, 2001, review, stated, that, humans, regularly, receive, 1, 000, to, 10, 000, times, greater, nitrosamine, exposure, from, food, and, tobacco, than, from, condom, use, and, concluded, that, the, risk, of, cancer, from, condom, use, is, very, low, however, a, 2004, study, in, germany, detected, nitrosamines, in, 29, out, of, 32, condom, brands, tested, and, concluded, that, exposure, from, condoms, might, exceed, the, exposure, from, food, by, 1, 5, to, 3, fold, in, addition, the, large, scale, use, of, disposable, condoms, has, resulted, in, concerns, over, their, environmental, impact, via, littering, and, in, landfills, where, they, can, eventually, wind, up, in, wildlife, environments, if, not, incinerated, or, otherwise, permanently, disposed, of, first, polyurethane, condoms, in, particular, given, they, are, a, form, of, plastic, are, not, biodegradable, and, latex, condoms, take, a, very, long, time, to, break, down, experts, such, as, avert, recommend, condoms, be, disposed, of, in, a, garbage, receptacle, as, flushing, them, down, the, toilet, which, some, people, do, may, cause, plumbing, blockages, and, other, problems, furthermore, the, plastic, and, foil, wrappers, condoms, are, packaged, in, are, also, not, biodegradable, however, the, benefits, condoms, offer, are, widely, considered, to, offset, their, small, landfill, mass, frequent, condom, or, wrapper, disposal, in, public, areas, such, as, a, parks, have, been, seen, as, a, persistent, litter, problem, while, biodegradable, latex, condoms, damage, the, environment, when, disposed, of, improperly, according, to, the, ocean, conservancy, condoms, along, with, certain, other, types, of, trash, cover, the, coral, reefs, and, smother, sea, grass, and, other, bottom, dwellers, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, also, has, expressed, concerns, that, many, animals, might, mistake, the, litter, for, food, in, much, of, the, western, world, the, introduction, of, the, pill, in, the, 1960s, was, associated, with, a, decline, in, condom, use, 267, 9, 272, 5, in, japan, oral, contraceptives, were, not, approved, for, use, until, september, 1999, and, even, then, access, was, more, restricted, than, in, other, industrialized, nations, perhaps, because, of, this, restricted, access, to, hormonal, contraception, japan, has, the, highest, rate, of, condom, usage, in, the, world, in, 2008, 80, of,
