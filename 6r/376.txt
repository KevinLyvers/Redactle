game, is, popular, at, all, levels, with, amateur, and, club, tournaments, generally, held, in, the, summer, months, sevens, is, one, of, the, most, well, distributed, forms, of, rugby, and, is, popular, in, parts, of, africa, asia, europe, and, the, americas, and, especially, in, the, south, pacific, rugby, sevens, originated, in, the, 1880s, in, the, scottish, town, of, melrose, the, melrose, sevens, tournament, is, still, played, annually, the, popularity, of, rugby, sevens, increased, further, with, the, development, of, the, hong, kong, sevens, in, the, 1970s, and, was, later, followed, by, the, inclusion, of, the, sport, into, the, commonwealth, games, for, the, first, time, in, 1998, and, the, establishment, of, the, annual, world, rugby, sevens, series, in, 1999, and, the, world, rugby, women, s, sevens, series, in, 2012, in, 2016, rugby, sevens, was, contested, in, the, summer, olympics, for, the, first, time, it, has, also, been, played, in, events, such, as, the, games, of, the, small, states, of, europe, pan, american, games, and, the, asian, games, and, in, 2018, a, women, s, tournament, was, played, for, the, first, time, at, the, commonwealth, games, rugby, sevens, is, sanctioned, by, world, rugby, and, is, played, under, similar, laws, with, exceptions, noted, below, and, on, a, field, of, the, same, dimensions, as, the, 15, player, game, whereas, a, regular, rugby, union, match, lasts, at, least, 80, minutes, a, normal, sevens, match, consists, of, two, halves, of, seven, minutes, with, a, two, minute, half, time, break, previously, the, final, of, a, competition, could, be, played, over, two, halves, of, ten, minutes, each, but, beginning, in, 2017, final, round, matches, were, limited, to, seven, minute, halves, excluding, ties, in, an, effort, to, reduce, injuries, sevens, scores, are, generally, comparable, to, regular, rugby, scores, but, scoring, occurs, much, more, frequently, in, sevens, since, the, defenders, are, more, spaced, out, the, scoring, system, is, the, same, as, regular, rugby, union, namely, five, points, for, a, try, three, points, for, a, penalty, or, drop, goal, and, two, points, for, a, post, try, conversion, the, shorter, match, length, allows, rugby, sevens, tournaments, to, be, completed, in, a, day, or, a, weekend, many, sevens, tournaments, have, a, competition, for, a, cup, a, plate, a, bowl, and, a, shield, allowing, many, teams, of, different, standards, to, avoid, leaving, empty, handed, sevens, tournaments, are, traditionally, known, for, having, more, of, a, relaxed, atmosphere, than, fifteen, a, side, games, and, are, often, known, as, festivals, sevens, tournaments, gained, their, popularity, as, an, end, of, season, diversion, from, the, dourer, and, sterner, stuff, that, provides, the, bulk, of, a, normal, season, s, watching, fans, frequently, attend, in, fancy, dress, and, entertainment, is, put, on, for, them, the, hong, kong, sevens, tournament, has, been, especially, important, in, popularising, the, game, in, asia, and, rugby, sevens, has, been, important, as, a, form, of, international, rugby, evangelism, hence, it, is, perhaps, the, most, widely, played, form, of, the, game, with, tournaments, in, places, as, far, apart, as, bogota, and, bangkok, kuala, lumpur, and, kenya, singapore, and, scandinavia, as, well, as, the, countries, in, which, rugby, union, is, well, known, sevens, is, played, on, a, standard, rugby, union, playing, field, the, field, measures, up, to, 100, metres, 330, ft, long, and, 70, metres, 230, ft, wide, on, each, goal, line, is, an, h, shaped, goal, there, are, several, variations, in, laws, which, apply, to, rugby, sevens, primarily, to, speed, up, the, game, and, to, account, for, the, reduced, number, of, players, the, main, changes, can, be, summarised, as, follows, teams, are, composed, of, seven, players, three, forwards, and, four, backs, scrums, are, made, up, of, three, players, from, each, team, the, chart, below, shows, a, team, s, typical, formation, at, scrum, time, with, three, forwards, bound, into, the, scrum, a, scrum, half, waiting, to, retrieve, the, ball, once, it, exits, the, scrum, and, three, backs, positioned, to, receive, a, pass, the, numbers, shown, here, are, for, illustrative, purposes, only, unlike, rugby, fifteens, where, a, player, s, number, corresponds, to, his, position, numbering, in, rugby, sevens, is, more, flexible, in, a, squad, of, twelve, players, the, players, will, be, numbered, one, through, twelve, the, starting, players, can, have, any, of, the, twelve, numbers, not, necessarily, one, through, seven, no, set, numbers, differentiate, positions, for, example, numbers, one, through, three, are, not, reserved, for, forwards, but, can, be, worn, by, any, squad, player, in, open, play, a, typical, defensive, formation, involves, a, line, of, six, defenders, with, one, sweeper, behind, the, line, with, the, attacking, team, using, all, seven, players, against, the, defending, team, s, six, in, the, line, the, attacking, team, often, attempts, to, move, the, ball, to, create, an, overload, the, defensive, line, can, be, put, under, pressure, if, the, defending, team, makes, a, tackle, and, commits, players, to, the, ruck, with, fewer, players, in, the, defending, line, it, leaves, more, space, for, the, attacking, team, to, exploit, rugby, sevens, tends, to, be, played, at, a, faster, pace, than, rugby, fifteens, because, of, the, faster, nature, of, the, game, sevens, players, are, often, backs, or, loose, forwards, in, fifteens, rugby, the, differences, are, most, notable, on, game, restarts, because, scrums, in, sevens, involve, three, players, forming, one, row, instead, of, eight, players, forming, three, rows, scrums, tend, to, assemble, more, quickly, require, fewer, restarts, and, the, ball, exits, the, scrum, more, quickly, penalties, in, sevens, are, generally, taken, with, a, quick, tap, instead, of, a, kick, for, touch, and, a, line, out, resulting, in, the, ball, being, put, back, in, play, more, quickly, when, a, player, is, tackled, and, a, ruck, is, formed, the, ball, tends, to, exit, the, ruck, more, quickly, as, the, attacking, team, generally, has, only, three, players, involved, in, the, ruck, the, tackled, player, one, support, player, and, one, scrum, half, at, loretto, school, in, musselburgh, scotland, the, then, headmaster, hely, hutchinson, almond, got, the, schoolboys, to, play, short, sided, matches, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, this, was, to, improve, the, players, passing, a, full, rugby, union, match, at, the, time, was, twenty, a, side, and, individualism, was, the, style, almond, stated, that, he, urged, on, his, boys, in, the, sixties, that, if, only, they, would, pass, constantly, and, systematically, to, each, other, they, would, baffle, any, side, unaccustomed, to, such, tactics, almond, a, pioneer, in, collectivism, in, rugby, union, struggled, to, get, his, schoolboys, to, get, used, to, the, system, the, schoolboys, stated, this, was, funking, but, by, 1872, he, was, organising, eleven, a, side, matches, with, edinburgh, academicals, in, 2007, almond, was, nominated, for, the, irb, hall, of, fame, but, was, not, inducted, collectivism, did, eventually, take, hold, with, new, clubs, and, scotland, exported, it, through, sevens, around, the, world, and, sides, like, new, zealand, and, south, africa, quickly, realised, the, benefits, of, collectivism, the, bigger, clubs, in, scotland, were, reluctant, to, change, their, ways, they, were, winning, and, could, attract, the, best, individualists, from, other, clubs, to, maintain, their, position, in, 1895, the, scottish, referee, newspaper, was, still, criticising, west, of, scotland, for, not, using, the, collective, method, in, england, the, push, for, smaller, sides, eventually, resulted, in, the, formation, of, rugby, league, and, there, was, experimentation, with, numbers, in, the, north, of, england, prior, to, the, split, there, was, a, six, a, side, tournament, in, huddersfield, in, september, 1879, played, under, regular, rules, but, with, 10, minute, halves, other, tournaments, were, played, over, the, next, few, years, across, the, north, before, being, replaced, by, a, nine, a, side, game, matches, attracted, large, crowds, and, raised, thousands, to, support, the, clubs, or, local, hospital, charities, in, august, 1890, yorkshire, suspended, 8, teams, and, in, september, lancashire, banned, games, with, less, than, 15, a, side, over, allegations, of,
