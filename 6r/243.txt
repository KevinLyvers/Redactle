promiscuity, is, the, practice, of, engaging, in, sexual, activity, frequently, with, different, partners, or, being, indiscriminate, in, the, choice, of, sexual, partners, the, term, can, carry, a, moral, judgment, a, common, example, of, behavior, viewed, as, promiscuous, by, many, cultures, is, the, one, night, stand, and, its, frequency, is, used, by, researchers, as, a, marker, for, promiscuity, what, sexual, behavior, is, considered, promiscuous, varies, between, cultures, as, does, the, prevalence, of, promiscuity, different, standards, are, often, applied, to, different, genders, and, civil, statutes, feminists, have, traditionally, argued, a, significant, double, standard, exists, between, how, men, and, women, are, judged, for, promiscuity, historically, stereotypes, of, the, promiscuous, woman, have, tended, to, be, pejorative, such, as, the, slut, or, the, harlot, while, male, stereotypes, have, been, more, varied, some, expressing, approval, such, as, the, stud, or, the, player, while, others, imply, societal, deviance, such, as, the, womanizer, or, the, philanderer, a, scientific, study, published, in, 2005, found, that, promiscuous, men, and, women, are, both, prone, to, derogatory, judgment, promiscuity, is, common, in, many, animal, species, some, species, have, promiscuous, mating, systems, ranging, from, polyandry, and, polygyny, to, mating, systems, with, no, stable, relationships, where, mating, between, two, individuals, is, a, one, time, event, many, species, form, stable, pair, bonds, but, still, mate, with, other, individuals, outside, the, pair, in, biology, incidents, of, promiscuity, in, species, that, form, pair, bonds, are, usually, called, extra, pair, copulations, accurately, assessing, people, s, sexual, behavior, is, difficult, since, strong, social, and, personal, motivations, occur, depending, on, social, sanctions, and, taboos, for, either, minimizing, or, exaggerating, reported, sexual, activity, american, experiments, in, 1978, and, 1982, found, the, great, majority, of, men, were, willing, to, have, sex, with, women, they, did, not, know, of, average, attractiveness, who, propositioned, them, no, woman, by, contrast, agreed, to, such, propositions, from, men, of, average, attractiveness, while, men, were, in, general, comfortable, with, the, requests, regardless, of, their, willingness, women, responded, with, shock, and, disgust, the, number, of, sexual, partners, people, have, had, in, their, lifetimes, varies, widely, within, a, population, we, see, a, higher, number, of, people, who, are, more, comfortable, with, their, sexuality, in, the, modern, world, a, 2007, nationwide, survey, in, the, united, states, found, the, median, number, of, female, sexual, partners, reported, by, men, was, seven, and, the, median, number, of, male, partners, reported, by, women, was, four, the, men, possibly, exaggerated, their, reported, number, of, partners, women, reported, a, number, lower, than, the, actual, number, or, a, minority, of, women, had, a, sufficiently, larger, number, than, most, other, women, to, create, a, mean, significantly, higher, than, the, median, or, all, of, the, above, about, 29, of, men, and, 9, of, women, reported, to, have, had, more, than, 15, sexual, partners, in, their, lifetimes, studies, of, the, spread, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, consistently, demonstrate, a, small, percentage, of, the, studied, population, has, more, partners, than, the, average, man, or, woman, and, a, smaller, number, of, people, have, fewer, than, the, statistical, average, an, important, question, in, the, epidemiology, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, is, whether, or, not, these, groups, copulate, mostly, at, random, with, sexual, partners, from, throughout, a, population, or, within, their, social, groups, a, 2006, systematic, review, analyzing, data, from, 59, countries, worldwide, found, no, association, between, regional, sexual, behavior, tendencies, such, as, number, of, sexual, partners, and, sexual, health, status, much, more, predictive, of, sexual, health, status, are, socioeconomic, factors, like, poverty, and, mobility, other, studies, have, suggested, that, people, with, multiple, casual, sex, partners, are, more, likely, to, be, diagnosed, with, sexually, transmitted, infections, severe, and, impulsive, promiscuity, along, with, a, compulsive, urge, to, engage, in, illicit, sex, with, attached, individuals, is, a, common, symptom, of, borderline, personality, disorder, histrionic, personality, disorder, narcissistic, personality, disorder, and, antisocial, personality, disorder, but, most, promiscuous, individuals, do, not, have, these, disorders, in, 2008, a, u, s, university, study, of, international, promiscuity, found, that, finns, have, had, the, largest, number, of, sex, partners, in, the, industrialized, world, and, british, people, have, the, largest, number, among, big, western, industrial, nations, the, study, measured, one, night, stands, attitudes, to, casual, sex, and, number, of, sexual, partners, a, 2014, nationwide, survey, in, the, united, kingdom, named, liverpool, the, country, s, most, promiscuous, city, britain, s, position, on, the, international, index, may, be, linked, to, increasing, social, acceptance, of, promiscuity, among, women, as, well, as, men, britain, s, ranking, was, ascribed, to, factors, such, as, the, decline, of, religious, scruples, about, extramarital, sex, the, growth, of, equal, pay, and, equal, rights, for, women, and, a, highly, sexualized, popular, culture, the, top, 10, ranking, oecd, nations, with, a, population, over, 10, million, on, the, study, s, promiscuity, index, in, descending, order, were, the, united, kingdom, germany, the, netherlands, czechia, australia, the, united, states, france, turkey, mexico, and, canada, a, 2017, survey, by, superdrug, found, that, the, united, kingdom, was, the, country, with, the, most, sex, partners, with, an, average, of, 7, while, austria, had, around, 6, 5, the, 2012, trojan, sex, life, survey, found, that, african, american, men, reported, an, average, of, 38, sex, partners, in, their, lifetime, a, study, funded, by, condom, maker, durex, conducted, in, 2006, and, published, in, 2009, measured, promiscuity, by, a, total, number, of, sexual, partners, the, survey, found, austrian, men, had, the, highest, number, of, sex, partners, globally, with, 29, 3, sexual, partners, on, average, new, zealand, women, had, the, highest, number, of, sex, partners, for, females, in, the, world, with, an, average, of, 20, 4, sexual, partners, in, all, of, the, countries, surveyed, except, new, zealand, men, reported, more, sexual, partners, than, women, one, review, found, the, people, from, developed, western, countries, had, more, sex, partners, than, people, from, developing, countries, in, general, while, the, rate, of, stis, was, higher, in, developing, countries, according, to, the, 2005, global, sex, survey, by, durex, people, have, had, on, average, nine, sexual, partners, the, most, in, turkey, 14, 5, and, australia, 13, 3, and, the, fewest, in, india, 3, and, china, 3, 1, in, many, cases, the, population, of, each, country, that, participates, is, approximately, 1000, people, and, can, equate, to, less, than, 0, 0003, of, the, population, e, g, the, 2017, survey, of, 42, nations, surveyed, only, 33, 000, people, in, india, data, was, collected, from, less, than, 0, 000001, of, the, total, population, at, that, time, according, to, the, 2012, general, social, survey, in, the, united, states, by, the, national, opinion, research, center, at, the, university, of, chicago, protestants, on, average, had, more, sex, partners, than, catholics, similarly, a, 2019, study, by, the, institute, for, family, studies, in, the, us, found, that, of, never, married, young, people, protestants, have, more, sexual, partners, than, catholics, a, 1994, study, in, the, united, states, which, looked, at, the, number, of, sexual, partners, in, a, lifetime, found, 20, of, heterosexual, men, had, one, partner, 55, had, two, to, 20, partners, and, 25, had, more, than, 20, sexual, partners, more, recent, studies, have, reported, similar, numbers, in, the, united, kingdom, a, nationally, representative, study, in, 2013, found, that, 33, 9, of, heterosexual, men, had, 10, or, more, lifetime, sexual, partners, among, men, between, 45, and, 54, years, old, 43, 1, reported, 10, or, more, sexual, partners, a, 2003, representative, study, in, australia, found, that, heterosexual, men, had, a, median, of, 8, female, sexual, partners, in, their, lifetime, for, lifetime, sexual, partners, 5, 8, had, 0, partners, 10, 3, had, 1, partner, 6, 1, had, 2, partners, 33, had, between, 3, and, 9, partners, 38, 3, had, between, 10, and, 49, partners, and, 6, 6, had, more, than, 50, female, sexual, partners, a, 2014, representative, study, in, australia, found, that, heterosexual, men, had, a, median, of, 7, 8, female, sexual, partners, in, their, lifetime, for, lifetime, sexual, partners, 3, 7, had, 0, partners, 12, 6, had, 1, partner, 6, 8, had, 2, partners, 32, 3, had, between, 3, and, 9, partners, 36, 9, had, between, 10, and, 49, partners, and, 7, 8, had, more, than, 50, female, sexual, partners, research, by, j, michael, bailey, found, that, heterosexual, men, had, the, same, level, of, interest, in, casual, sex, as, gay, men, however, he, found, straight, men, were, limited, in, their, ability, to, acquire, high, numbers, of, female, partners, according, to, bailey, these, facts, suggest, that, women, are, responsible, for, the, pace, of, sex, gay, and, straight, men, both, want, casual, sex, but, only, straight, men, have, the, brake, of, women, s, sexually, cautious, nature, to, slow, them, a, 1989, study, found, having, over, 100, partners, to, be, present, though, rare, among, homosexual, males, an, extensive, 1994, study, found, that, difference, in, the, mean, number, of, sexual, partners, between, gay, and, straight, men, did, not, appear, very, large, a, 2007, study, reported, that, two, large, population, surveys, found, the, majority, of, gay, men, had, similar, numbers, of, unprotected, sexual, partners, annually, as, straight, men, and, women, the, 2013, british, natsal, study, found, that, gay, men, typically, had, 19, sexual, partners, in, a, lifetime, median, in, the, previous, year, 51, 8, reported, having, either, 0, or, 1, sexual, partner, a, further, 21, 3, reported, having, between, 2, and, 4, sexual, partners, 7, 3, reported, having, between, 5, and, 9, and, 19, 6, reported, having, 10, or, more, sexual, partners, a, 2014, study, in, australia, found, gay, men, had, a, median, of, 22, sexual, partners, in, a, lifetime, sexual, partner, was, defined, as, any, sexual, contact, kissing, touching, or, intercourse, 30, of, gay, respondents, reported, 0, 9, partners, in, their, lifetime, 50, 1, of, gay, men, reported, having, either, 0, or, 1, partner, in, the, previous, year, while, 25, 6, reported, 10, or, more, partners, in, the, previous, year, research, on, gay, sexual, behavior, may, overrepresent, promiscuous, respondents, this, is, because, gay, men, are, a, small, portion, of, the, male, population, and, thus, many, researchers, have, relied, on, convenience, surveys, to, research, behavior, of, gay, men, examples, of, this, type, of, sampling, includes, surveying, men, on, dating, apps, such, as, grindr, or, finding, volunteers, at, gay, bars, clubs, and, saunas, convenience, surveys, often, exclude, gay, men, who, are, in, a, relationship, and, gay, men, who, do, not, use, dating, apps, or, attend, gay, venues, for, example, the, british, and, european, convenience, surveys, included, approximately, five, times, as, many, gay, men, who, reported, 5, or, more, sexual, partners, than, the, nationally, representative, natsal, study, did, probability, sample, surveys, are, more, useful, in, this, regard, because, they, seek, to, accurately, reflect, the, characteristics, of, the, gay, male, population, examples, include, the, natsal, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, general, social, survey, in, the, united, states, according, to, john, corvino, opponents, of, gay, rights, often, use, convenience, sample, statistics, to, support, their, belief, that, gay, men, are, promiscuous, but, that, larger, representative, samples, show, that, the, difference, is, not, so, large, and, that, extreme, promiscuity, occurs, in, a, minority, of, gay, men, psychologist, j, michael, bailey, has, stated, that, social, conservatives, use, promiscuity, among, gay, men, as, evidence, of, a, decadent, nature, of, gay, men, but, says, i, think, they, re, wrong, promiscuous, gay, men, are, expressing, an, essentially, masculine, trait, they, are, doing, what, most, heterosexual, men, would, do, if, they, could, they, are, in, this, way, just, like, heterosexual, men, except, that, they, don, t, have, women, to, constrain, them, 87, regarding, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, some, researchers, have, said, that, the, number, of, sexual, partners, had, by, gay, men, cannot, fully, explain, rates, of, hiv, infection, in, this, population, most, gay, men, report, having, similar, numbers, of, unprotected, sexual, partners, as, straight, men, on, an, annual, basis, unprotected, receptive, anal, sex, which, holds, a, much, higher, risk, of, hiv, transmission, appears, to, be, the, major, factor, in, 1994, a, study, in, the, united, states, found, almost, all, married, heterosexual, women, reported, having, sexual, contact, only, with, their, husbands, and, unmarried, women, almost, always, reported, having, no, more, than, one, sexual, partner, in, the, past, three, months, lesbians, who, had, long, term, partners, reported, having, fewer, outside, partners, than, heterosexual, women, more, recent, research, however, contradicts, the, assertion, that, heterosexual, women, are, largely, monogamous, a, 2002, study, estimated, that, 45, to, 55, of, married, heterosexual, women, engage, in, sexual, relationships, outside, of, their, marriage, while, the, estimate, for, heterosexual, men, engaging, in, the, same, conduct, was, 50, 60, in, the, same, study, one, possible, explanation, for, hyper, sexuality, is, child, sexual, abuse, csa, trauma, many, studies, have, examined, the, correlation, between, csa, and, risky, sexual, behavior, rodriguez, srednicki, and, ofelia, examined, the, correlation, of, csa, experienced, by, women, and, their, self, destructive, behavior, as, adults, using, a, questionnaire, the, diversity, and, ages, of, the, women, varied, slightly, fewer, than, half, the, women, reported, csa, while, the, remainder, reported, no, childhood, trauma, the, results, of, the, study, determined, that, self, destructive, behaviors, including, hypersexuality, correlates, with, csa, in, women, csa, can, create, sexual, schemas, that, result, in, risky, sexual, behavior, this, can, play, out, in, their, sexual, interactions, as, girls, get, older, the, sexual, behaviors, of, women, that, experienced, csa, differed, from, those, of, women, without, exposure, to, csa, studies, show, csa, survivors, tend, to, have, more, sexual, partners, and, engage, in, higher, risk, sexual, behaviors, since, at, least, 1450, the, word, slut, has, been, used, often, pejoratively, to, describe, a, sexually, promiscuous, woman, in, and, before, the, elizabethan, and, jacobean, eras, terms, like, strumpet, and, whore, were, used, to, describe, women, deemed, promiscuous, as, seen, for, example, in, john, webster, s, 1612, play, the, white, devil, thornhill, and, gangestad, found, that, women, are, much, more, likely, to, sexually, fantasize, about, and, be, attracted, to, extra, pair, men, during, the, fertile, phase, of, the, menstrual, cycle, than, the, luteal, phase, whereas, attraction, to, the, primary, partner, does, not, change, depending, on, the, menstrual, cycle, a, 2004, study, by, pillsworth, hasselton, and, buss, contradicted, this, finding, greater, in, pair, sexual, attraction, during, this, phase, and, no, increase, in, attraction, to, extra, pair, men, in, norwegian, students, kennair, et, al, 2023, found, no, signs, of, a, sexual, double, standard, in, short, term, or, long, term, mating, contexts, nor, in, choosing, a, friend, except, that, women, s, self, stimulation, was, more, acceptable, than, men, s, evolutionary, psychologists, propose, that, a, conditional, human, tendency, for, promiscuity, is, inherited, from, hunter, gatherer, ancestors, promiscuity, increases, the, likelihood, of, having, children, thus, evolutionary, fitness, according, to, them, female, promiscuity, is, advantageous, in, that, it, allows, females, to, choose, fathers, for, their, children, who, have, better, genes, than, their, mates, to, ensure, better, care, for, their, offspring, have, more, children, and, as, a, form, of, fertility, insurance, male, promiscuity, was, likely, advantageous, because, it, allowed, males, to, father, more, children, primitive, promiscuity, or, original, promiscuity, was, the, 19th, century, hypothesis, that, humans, originally, lived, in, a, state, of, promiscuity, or, hetaerism, before, the, advent, of, society, as, we, understand, it, hetaerism, is, a, theoretical, early, state, of, human, society, as, postulated, by, 19th, century, anthropologists, which, was, characterized, by, the, absence, of, the, institution, of, marriage, in, any, form, and, in, which, women, were, the, common, property, of, their, tribe, and, in, which, children, never, knew, who, their, fathers, were, the, reconstruction, of, the, original, state, of, primitive, society, or, humanity, was, based, on, the, idea, of, progress, according, to, which, all, cultures, have, degrees, of, improvement, and, becoming, more, complicated, it, seemed, logical, to, assume, that, never, before, the, types, of, families, developed, did, they, simply, exist, and, in, primitive, society, sexual, relations, were, without, any, boundaries, and, taboos, this, view, is, represented, inter, alia, by, anthropologist, lewis, h, morgan, in, ancient, society, and, friedrich, engels, work, the, origin, of, the, family, private, property, and, the, state, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, this, notion, was, rejected, by, a, number, of, authors, e, g, edvard, westermarck, a, finnish, philosopher, social, anthropologist, and, sociologist, with, in, depth, knowledge, of, the, history, of, marriage, who, provided, strong, evidence, that, at, least, in, the, first, stages, of, cultural, development, monogamy, has, been, a, perfectly, normal, and, natural, form, of, man, woman, coexistence, modern, cultural, anthropology, has, not, confirmed, the, existence, of, a, complete, promiscuity, in, any, known, society, or, culture, the, evidence, of, history, is, reduced, to, some, texts, of, herodotus, strabo, and, solinus, which, have, been, hard, to, interpret, christianity, judaism, and, islam, condemn, promiscuity, and, instead, advocate, lifelong, monogamous, marriage, although, islam, allows, polygamy, for, men, the, perspectives, on, promiscuity, vary, significantly, depending, on, the, region, every, country, has, different, values, and, morals, pertaining, to, sexual, life, promiscuity, has, been, practiced, in, hippie, communities, and, other, alternative, subcultures, since, the, 1960s, cultural, revolution, sex, and, culture, is, a, book, by, j, d, unwin, concerning, the, correlation, between, a, society, s, level, of, cultural, achievement, and, its, level, of, sexual, restraint, published, in, 1934, the, book, concluded, with, the, theory, that, as, societies, develop, they, become, more, sexually, liberal, accelerating, the, social, entropy, of, the, society, and, thereby, diminishing, its, creative, and, expansive, energy, many, animal, species, such, as, spotted, hyenas, pigs, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, are, promiscuous, as, a, rule, and, do, not, form, pair, bonds, although, social, monogamy, occurs, in, about, 90, of, avian, species, and, about, 3, of, mammalian, species, an, estimated, 90, of, socially, monogamous, species, exhibit, individual, promiscuity, in, the, form, of, copulation, outside, the, pair, bond, in, the, animal, world, some, species, including, birds, such, as, swans, and, fish, such, as, neolamprologus, pulcher, once, believed, monogamous, are, now, known, to, engage, in, extra, pair, copulations, one, example, of, extra, pair, fertilization, epf, in, birds, is, the, black, throated, blue, warblers, though, it, is, a, socially, monogamous, species, both, males, and, females, engage, in, epf, the, darwin, bateman, paradigm, which, states, that, males, are, typically, eager, to, copulate, while, females, are, more, choosy, about, whom, to, mate, with, has, been, confirmed, by, a, meta, analysis
