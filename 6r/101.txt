ham, is, pork, from, a, leg, cut, that, has, been, preserved, by, wet, or, dry, curing, with, or, without, smoking, as, a, processed, meat, the, term, ham, includes, both, whole, cuts, of, meat, and, ones, that, have, been, mechanically, formed, ham, is, made, around, the, world, including, a, number, of, regional, specialties, in, addition, numerous, ham, products, have, specific, geographical, naming, protection, the, preserving, of, pork, leg, as, ham, has, a, long, history, with, traces, of, production, of, cured, ham, among, the, etruscan, civilization, known, in, the, 6th, and, 5th, century, bc, cato, the, elder, wrote, about, the, salting, of, hams, in, his, de, agri, cultura, tome, around, 160, bc, there, are, claims, that, the, chinese, were, the, first, people, to, mention, the, production, of, cured, ham, larousse, gastronomique, claims, an, origin, from, gaul, it, was, certainly, well, established, by, the, roman, period, as, evidenced, by, an, import, trade, from, gaul, mentioned, by, marcus, terentius, varro, in, his, writings, the, modern, word, ham, is, derived, from, the, old, english, ham, or, hom, meaning, the, hollow, or, bend, of, the, knee, from, a, germanic, base, where, it, meant, crooked, it, began, to, refer, to, the, cut, of, pork, derived, from, the, hind, leg, of, a, pig, around, the, 15th, century, because, of, the, preservation, process, ham, is, a, compound, foodstuff, or, ingredient, being, made, up, of, the, original, meat, as, well, as, the, remnants, of, the, preserving, agent, s, such, as, salt, but, it, is, still, recognised, as, a, food, in, its, own, right, ham, is, produced, by, curing, raw, pork, by, salting, also, known, as, dry, curing, or, brining, also, known, as, wet, curing, additionally, smoking, may, be, employed, and, seasonings, may, be, added, traditional, dry, cure, hams, may, use, only, salt, as, the, curative, agent, although, this, is, comparatively, rare, this, process, involves, cleaning, the, raw, meat, covering, it, in, salt, while, it, is, gradually, pressed, to, squeeze, out, fluid, specific, herbs, and, spices, may, be, used, to, add, flavour, during, this, step, the, hams, are, then, washed, and, hung, in, a, dark, temperature, regulated, place, until, dry, it, is, then, hung, to, air, for, another, period, of, time, the, duration, of, the, curing, process, varies, by, the, type, of, ham, for, example, jinhua, ham, takes, approximately, 8, to, 10, months, to, complete, jam, n, serrano, cures, in, 9, 12, months, prosciutto, di, parma, takes, more, than, 12, months, and, iberian, ham, can, take, up, to, 2, years, to, reach, the, desired, flavor, characteristics, many, dry, cured, hams, such, as, prosciutto, are, eaten, without, being, cooked, most, modern, dry, cure, hams, also, use, nitrites, either, sodium, nitrite, or, potassium, nitrite, which, are, added, along, with, the, salt, nitrites, are, used, because, they, prevent, bacterial, growth, and, in, a, reaction, with, the, meat, s, myoglobin, give, the, product, a, desirable, dark, red, color, the, amount, and, mixture, of, salt, and, nitrites, used, have, an, effect, on, the, shrinkage, of, the, meat, because, of, the, toxicity, of, nitrite, some, areas, specify, a, maximum, allowable, content, of, nitrite, in, the, final, product, under, certain, conditions, especially, during, cooking, nitrites, in, meat, can, react, with, degradation, products, of, amino, acids, forming, nitrosamines, which, are, known, carcinogens, the, dry, curing, of, ham, involves, a, number, of, enzymatic, reactions, the, enzymes, involved, are, proteinases, cathepsins, b, d, h, l, and, calpains, and, exopeptidases, peptidase, and, aminopeptidase, these, enzymes, cause, proteolysis, of, muscle, tissue, which, creates, large, numbers, of, small, peptides, and, free, amino, acids, while, the, adipose, tissue, undergoes, lipolysis, to, create, free, fatty, acids, salt, and, phosphates, act, as, strong, inhibitors, of, proteolytic, activity, animal, factors, influencing, enzymatic, activity, include, age, weight, and, breed, during, the, process, itself, conditions, such, as, temperature, duration, water, content, redox, potential, and, salt, content, all, have, an, effect, on, the, meat, the, salt, content, in, dry, cured, ham, varies, throughout, a, piece, of, meat, with, gradients, determinable, through, sampling, and, testing, or, non, invasively, through, ct, scanning, wet, cured, hams, are, brined, which, involves, the, immersion, of, the, meat, in, a, brine, sometimes, with, other, ingredients, such, as, sugar, also, added, for, flavour, the, meat, is, typically, kept, in, the, brine, for, around, 3, to, 14, days, wet, curing, also, has, the, effect, of, increasing, volume, and, weight, of, the, finished, product, by, about, 4, the, wet, curing, process, can, also, be, achieved, by, pumping, the, curing, solution, into, the, meat, this, can, be, quicker, increase, the, weight, of, the, finished, product, by, more, than, immersion, and, ensure, a, more, even, distribution, of, salt, through, the, meat, this, process, is, quicker, than, traditional, brining, normally, being, completed, in, a, few, days, wet, cured, ham, is, usually, cooked, either, during, processing, or, after, ageing, it, is, first, brined, then, cooked, in, a, container, and, finally, surface, pasteurized, italian, regulations, allow, it, to, contain, salt, nitrites, sugar, dextrose, fructose, lactose, maltodextrin, milk, protein, soy, protein, natural, or, modified, starches, spices, gelatin, and, flavorings, ham, can, also, be, additionally, preserved, through, smoking, in, which, the, meat, is, placed, in, a, smokehouse, or, equivalent, to, be, cured, by, the, action, of, smoke, the, main, flavor, compounds, of, smoked, ham, are, guaiacol, and, its, 4, 5, and, 6, methyl, derivatives, as, well, as, 2, 6, dimethylphenol, these, compounds, are, produced, by, combustion, of, lignin, a, major, constituent, of, wood, used, in, the, smokehouse, in, many, countries, the, term, is, now, protected, by, statute, with, a, specific, definition, for, instance, in, the, united, states, the, code, of, federal, regulations, cfr, says, that, the, word, ham, without, any, prefix, indicating, the, species, of, animal, from, which, derived, shall, be, used, in, labeling, only, in, connection, with, the, hind, legs, of, swine, in, addition, to, the, main, categories, some, processing, choices, can, affect, legal, labeling, for, instance, in, the, united, states, a, smoked, ham, must, have, been, smoked, by, hanging, over, burning, wood, chips, in, a, smokehouse, or, an, atomized, spray, of, liquid, smoke, such, that, the, product, appearance, is, equivalent, a, hickory, smoked, ham, must, have, been, smoked, using, only, hickory, however, injecting, smoke, flavor, is, not, legal, grounds, for, claiming, the, ham, was, smoked, these, are, labeled, smoke, flavor, added, hams, can, only, be, labeled, honey, cured, if, honey, was, at, least, 50, of, the, sweetener, used, is, at, least, 3, of, the, formula, and, has, a, discernible, effect, on, flavor, so, called, lean, and, extra, lean, hams, must, adhere, to, maximum, levels, of, fat, and, cholesterol, per, 100, grams, of, product, whole, fresh, pork, leg, can, be, labeled, as, fresh, ham, in, the, united, states, a, number, of, hams, worldwide, have, some, level, of, protection, of, their, unique, characteristics, usually, relating, to, their, method, of, preservation, or, location, of, production, or, processing, dependent, on, jurisdiction, rules, may, prevent, any, other, product, being, sold, with, the, particular, appellation, such, as, through, the, european, protected, geographical, indication, ham, is, typically, used, in, its, sliced, form, often, as, a, filling, for, sandwiches, and, similar, foods, such, as, in, the, ham, sandwich, and, ham, and, cheese, sandwich, other, variations, include, toasted, sandwiches, such, as, the, croque, monsieur, and, the, cubano, it, is, also, a, popular, topping, for, pizza, in, the, united, states, in, the, united, kingdom, a, pork, leg, cut, either, whole, or, sliced, that, has, been, cured, but, requires, additional, cooking, is, known, as, gammon, gammons, were, traditionally, cured, before, being, cut, from, a, side, of, pork, along, with, bacon, when, cooked, gammon, is, ham, cooked, ham, joints, are, a, popular, dish, around, christmas, time, particularly, in, the, anglosphere, and, northern, europe, gammon, can, also, served, as, gammon, steaks, which, are, fried, or, grilled, and, served, in, a, similar, manner, to, bacon
