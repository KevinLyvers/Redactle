each, of, the, following, pits, in, sequence, and, capturing, based, on, the, state, of, the, board, the, game, s, object, is, to, plant, the, most, seeds, in, the, bank, this, leads, to, the, english, phrase, count, and, capture, sometimes, used, to, describe, the, gameplay, although, the, details, differ, greatly, this, general, sequence, applies, to, all, games, if, playing, in, capture, mode, once, a, player, ends, their, turn, in, an, empty, pit, on, their, own, side, they, capture, the, opponent, s, pieces, directly, across, once, captured, the, player, gets, to, put, the, seeds, in, their, own, bank, after, capturing, the, opponent, forfeits, a, turn, equipment, is, typically, a, board, constructed, of, various, materials, with, a, series, of, holes, arranged, in, rows, usually, two, or, four, the, materials, include, clay, and, other, shapeable, materials, some, games, are, more, often, played, with, holes, dug, in, the, earth, or, carved, in, stone, the, holes, may, be, referred, to, as, depressions, pits, or, houses, sometimes, large, holes, on, the, ends, of, the, board, called, stores, are, used, for, holding, the, pieces, playing, pieces, are, seeds, beans, stones, cowry, shells, half, marbles, or, other, small, undifferentiated, counters, that, are, placed, in, and, transferred, about, the, holes, during, play, board, configurations, vary, among, different, games, but, also, within, variations, of, a, given, game, for, example, endodoi, is, played, on, boards, from, 2, 6, to, 2, 10, the, largest, are, tchouba, mozambique, with, a, board, of, 160, 4, 40, holes, requiring, 320, seeds, and, en, geh, tanzania, played, on, longer, rows, with, up, to, 50, pits, a, total, of, 2, 50, 100, and, using, 400, seeds, the, most, minimalistic, variants, are, nano, wari, and, micro, wari, created, by, the, bulgarian, ethnologue, assia, popova, the, nano, wari, board, has, eight, seeds, in, just, two, pits, micro, wari, has, a, total, of, four, seeds, in, four, pits, with, a, two, rank, board, players, usually, are, considered, to, control, their, respective, sides, of, the, board, although, moves, often, are, made, into, the, opponent, s, side, with, a, four, rank, board, players, control, an, inner, row, and, an, outer, row, and, a, player, s, seeds, will, remain, in, these, closest, two, rows, unless, the, opponent, captures, them, the, objective, of, most, two, and, three, row, mancala, games, is, to, capture, more, stones, than, the, opponent, in, four, row, games, one, usually, seeks, to, leave, the, opponent, with, no, legal, move, or, sometimes, to, capture, all, counters, in, their, front, row, at, the, beginning, of, a, player, s, turn, they, select, a, hole, with, seeds, that, will, be, sown, around, the, board, this, selection, is, often, limited, to, holes, on, the, current, player, s, side, of, the, board, as, well, as, holes, with, a, certain, minimum, number, of, seeds, in, a, process, known, as, sowing, all, the, seeds, from, a, hole, are, dropped, one, by, one, into, subsequent, holes, in, a, motion, wrapping, around, the, board, sowing, is, an, apt, name, for, this, activity, since, not, only, are, many, games, traditionally, played, with, seeds, but, placing, seeds, one, at, a, time, in, different, holes, reflects, the, physical, act, of, sowing, if, the, sowing, action, stops, after, dropping, the, last, seed, the, game, is, considered, a, single, lap, game, multiple, laps, or, relay, sowing, is, a, frequent, feature, of, mancala, games, although, not, universal, when, relay, sowing, if, the, last, seed, during, sowing, lands, in, an, occupied, hole, all, the, contents, of, that, hole, including, the, last, sown, seed, are, immediately, re, sown, from, the, hole, the, process, usually, will, continue, until, sowing, ends, in, an, empty, hole, another, common, way, to, receive, multiple, laps, is, when, the, final, seed, sown, lands, in, your, designated, hole, many, games, from, the, indian, subcontinent, use, pussakanawa, laps, these, are, like, standard, multi, laps, but, instead, of, continuing, the, movement, with, the, contents, of, the, last, hole, filled, a, player, continues, with, the, next, hole, a, pussakanawa, lap, move, will, then, end, when, a, lap, ends, just, before, an, empty, hole, if, a, player, ends, their, stone, with, a, point, move, they, get, a, free, turn, depending, on, the, last, hole, sown, in, a, lap, a, player, may, capture, stones, from, the, board, the, exact, requirements, for, capture, as, well, as, what, is, done, with, captured, stones, vary, considerably, among, games, typically, a, capture, requires, sowing, to, end, in, a, hole, with, a, certain, number, of, stones, ending, across, the, board, from, stones, in, specific, configurations, or, landing, in, an, empty, hole, adjacent, to, an, opponent, s, hole, that, contains, one, or, more, pieces, another, common, way, of, capturing, is, to, capture, the, stones, that, reach, a, certain, number, of, seeds, at, any, moment, also, several, games, include, the, notion, of, capturing, holes, and, thus, all, seeds, sown, on, a, captured, hole, belong, at, the, end, of, the, game, to, the, player, who, captured, it, the, name, is, a, classification, or, type, of, game, rather, than, any, specific, game, some, of, the, most, popular, mancala, games, concerning, distribution, area, the, numbers, of, players, and, tournaments, and, publications, are, although, more, than, 800, names, of, traditional, mancala, games, are, known, some, names, denote, the, same, game, while, others, are, used, for, more, than, one, game, almost, 200, modern, invented, versions, have, also, been, described, like, other, board, games, mancala, games, have, led, to, psychological, studies, retschitzki, has, studied, the, cognitive, processes, used, by, awal, players, some, of, restchitzki, s, results, on, memory, and, problem, solving, have, recently, been, simulated, by, fernand, gobet, with, the, chrest, computer, model, de, voogt, has, studied, the, psychology, of, bao, playing, several, groups, of, mancala, games, have, their, own, tournaments, a,
