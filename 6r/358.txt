aspects, of, minor, league, baseball, this, is, due, in, large, part, to, the, 1922, u, s, supreme, court, ruling, in, federal, baseball, club, v, national, league, which, held, that, baseball, is, not, interstate, commerce, and, therefore, not, subject, to, federal, antitrust, law, mlb, is, the, only, league, that, has, such, a, status, and, has, not, faced, any, competition, since, this, case, this, ruling, has, been, weakened, only, slightly, in, subsequent, years, the, weakened, ruling, granted, more, stability, to, the, owners, of, teams, and, has, resulted, in, values, increasing, at, double, digit, rates, there, were, several, challenges, to, mlb, s, primacy, in, the, sport, with, notable, attempts, to, establish, competing, leagues, occurring, during, the, late, 1800s, from,

percent, split, between, several, cable, operators, and, satellite, provider, directv, it, operates, out, of, studios, in, secaucus, new, jersey, and, also, has, editorial, independence, from, the, league, in, 1920, the, weak, national, commission, created, to, manage, relationships, between, the, two, leagues, was, replaced, with, the, much, more, powerful, commissioner, of, baseball, who, had, the, power, to, make, decisions, for, all, of, professional, baseball, unilaterally, from, 1901, to, 1960, the, american, and, national, leagues, fielded, eight, teams, apiece, in, the, 1960s, mlb, expansion, added, eight, teams, including, the, first, non, u, s, team, the, montreal, expos, two, teams, the, seattle, mariners, and, the, toronto, blue, jays, were, also, added, in, the, 1970s, from, 1969, through, 1993, each, league, consisted, of, an, east, and, west, division, in, 1993, the, national, league, expanded, with, two, teams, the, florida, marlins, and, the, colorado, rockies, to, even, up, the, number, of, teams, in, both, leagues, a, third, division, the, central, division, was, formed, in, each, league, in, 1994, until, 1996, the, two, leagues, met, on, the, field, only, during, the, world, series, and, the, all, star, game, regular, season, interleague, play, was, introduced, in, 1997, in, march, 1995, two, new, franchises, the, arizona, diamondbacks, and, tampa, bay, devil, rays, now, known, as, the, tampa, bay, rays, were, awarded, by, mlb, which, began, play, in, 1998, this, addition, brought, the, total, number, of, franchises, to, 30, in, early, 1997, mlb, decided, to, assign, one, new, team, to, each, league, tampa, bay, joined, the, al, and, arizona, joined, the, nl, the, original, plan, was, to, have, an, odd, number, of, teams, in, each, league, 15, per, league, with, five, in, each, division, but, in, order, for, every, team, to, be, able, to, play, daily, this, would, have, required, interleague, play, to, be, scheduled, throughout, the, entire, season, however, it, was, unclear, at, the, time, if, the, interleague, play, would, continue, after, the, 1998, season, as, it, had, to, be, approved, by, the, players, union, for, this, and, other, reasons, it, was, decided, that, both, leagues, should, continue, to, have, an, even, number, of, teams, and, therefore, one, existing, club, would, have, to, switch, leagues, the, milwaukee, brewers, agreed, in, november, 1997, to, move, from, the, al, to, the, nl, thereby, making, the, nl, a, 16, team, league, at, the, same, time, the, detroit, tigers, agreed, to, move, from, the, al, east, to, the, al, central, to, replace, milwaukee, with, the, expansion, tampa, bay, devil, rays, joining, the, al, east, later, when, the, houston, astros, changed, ownership, prior, to, the, 2013, season, the, team, moved, from, the, nl, central, to, the, al, west, resulting, in, both, leagues, having, three, divisions, of, five, teams, each, and, allowing, all, teams, to, have, a, more, balanced, schedule, interleague, play, is, now, held, throughout, the, season, in, 2000, the, al, and, nl, were, dissolved, as, legal, entities, and, mlb, became, a, single, overall, league, de, jure, similar, to, the, national, football, league, nfl, national, basketball, association, nba, and, national, hockey, league, nhl, albeit, with, two, components, called, leagues, instead, of, conferences, the, same, rules, and, regulations, are, used, in, both, leagues, with, one, former, exception, the, al, operated, under, the, designated, hitter, dh, rule, while, the, nl, did, not, in, 2020, the, national, league, nl, used, the, designated, hitter, dh, rule, for, the, first, time, as, part, of, the, settlement, of, the, 2021, 22, major, league, baseball, lockout, this, change, was, made, permanent, thus, making, the, rules, in, the, two, leagues, identical, download, coordinates, as, an, asterisk, denotes, a, relocation, of, a, franchise, see, respective, team, articles, for,

team, the, cincinnati, red, stockings, was, established, a, schism, developed, between, professional, and, amateur, ballplayers, after, the, founding, of, the, cincinnati, club, the, nabbp, split, into, an, amateur, organization, and, a, professional, organization, the, national, association, of, professional, base, ball, players, often, known, as, the, national, association, na, was, formed, in, 1871, its, amateur, counterpart, disappeared, after, only, a, few, years, the, modern, chicago, cubs, and, atlanta, braves, franchises, trace, their, histories, back, to, the, national, association, of, professional, base, ball, players, in, the, 1870s, in, 1876, the, national, league, of, professional, base, ball, clubs, later, known, as, the, national, league, or, nl, was, established, after, the, na, proved, ineffective, the, league, placed, its, emphasis, on, clubs, rather, than, on, players, clubs, could, now, enforce, player, contracts, preventing, players, from, jumping, to, higher, paying, clubs, clubs, were, required, to, play, the, full, schedule, of, games, instead, of, forfeiting, scheduled, games, when, the, club, was, no, longer, in, the, running, for, the, league, championship, which, happened, frequently, under, the, na, a, concerted, effort, was, made, to, curb, gambling, on, games, which, was, leaving, the, validity, of, results, in, doubt, the, first, game, in, the, nl, on, saturday, april, 22, 1876, at, jefferson, street, grounds, in, philadelphia, is, often, pointed, to, as, the, beginning, of, mlb, the, early, years, of, the, nl, were, tumultuous, with, threats, from, rival, leagues, and, a, rebellion, by, players, against, the, hated, reserve, clause, which, restricted, the, free, movement, of, players, between, clubs, teams, came, and, went, 1882, was, the, first, season, where, the, league, s, membership, was, the, same, as, the, preceding, season, s, and, only, four, franchises, survived, to, see, 1900, competitor, leagues, formed, regularly, and, also, disbanded, regularly, the, most, successful, was, the, american, association, 1882, 1891, sometimes, called, the, beer, and, whiskey, league, for, its, tolerance, of, the, sale, of, alcoholic, beverages, to, spectators, for, several, years, the, nl, and, american, association, champions, met, in, a, postseason, championship, series, the, first, attempt, at, a, world, series, the, two, leagues, merged, in, 1892, as, a, single, 12, team, nl, but, the, nl, dropped, four, teams, after, the, 1899, season, this, led, to, the, formation, of, the, american, league, in, 1901, under, al, president, ban, johnson, and, the, resulting, bidding, war, for, players, led, to, widespread, contract, breaking, and, legal, disputes, the, war, between, the, al, and, nl, caused, shock, waves, throughout, the, baseball, world, at, a, meeting, at, the, leland, hotel, in, chicago, in, 1901, the, other, baseball, leagues, negotiated, a, plan, to, maintain, their, independence, a, new, national, association, was, formed, to, oversee, these, minor, leagues, after, 1902, the, nl, al, and, na, signed, a, new, national, agreement, which, tied, independent, contracts, to, the, reserve, clause, contracts, the, agreement, also, set, up, a, formal, classification, system, for, minor, leagues, the, forerunner, of, today, s, system, that, was, refined, by, branch, rickey, several, other, early, defunct, baseball, leagues, are, considered, major, leagues, and, their, statistics, and, records, are, included, with, those, of, the, two, modern, major, leagues, in, 1969, the, special, baseball, records, committee, of, major, league, baseball, officially, recognized, six, major, leagues, the, national, league, american, league, american, association, union, association, 1884, players, league, 1890, and, federal, league, 1914, 1915, the, status, of, the, national, association, as, a, major, league, has, been, a, point, of, dispute, among, baseball, researchers, while, its, statistics, are, not, recognized, by, major, league, baseball, its, statistics, are, included, with, those, of, other, major, leagues, by, some, baseball, reference, websites, such, as, retrosheet, some, researchers, including, nate, silver, dispute, the, major, league, status, of, the, union, association, by, pointing, out, that, franchises, came, and, went, and, that, the, st, louis, club, was, deliberately, stacked, the, st, louis, club, was, owned, by, the, league, s, president, and, it, was, the, only, club, that, was, close, to, major, league, caliber, in, december, 2020, major, league, baseball, announced, its, recognition, of, seven, leagues, within, negro, league, baseball, as, major, leagues, the, first, and, second, negro, national, leagues, 1920, 1931, and, 1933, 1948, the, eastern, colored, league, 1923, 1928, the, american, negro, league, 1929, the, east, west, league, 1932, the, negro, southern, league, 1932, and, the, negro, american, league, 1937, 1948, in, 2021, baseball, reference, website, baseball, reference, com, began, to, include, statistics, from, those, seven, leagues, into, their, major, league, statistics, in, may, 2024, major, league, baseball, announced, that, it, was, absorbing, the, available, negro, leagues, numbers, into, the, official, historical, record, the, period, between, 1900, and, 1919, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, dead, ball, era, games, of, this, era, tended, to, be, low, scoring, and, were, often, dominated, by, pitchers, such, as, walter, johnson, cy, young, christy, mathewson, mordecai, brown, and, grover, cleveland, alexander, the, term, also, accurately, describes, the, condition, of, the, baseball, itself, the, baseball, used, american, rather, than, the, modern, australian, wool, yarn, and, was, not, wound, as, tightly, affecting, the, distance, that, it, would, travel, more, significantly, balls, were, kept, in, play, until, they, were, mangled, soft, and, sometimes, lopsided, during, this, era, a, baseball, cost, three, dollars, equal, to, 52, 72, today, in, inflation, adjusted, usd, and, owners, were, reluctant, to, purchase, new, balls, fans, were, expected, to, throw, back, fouls, and, rare, home, runs, baseballs, also, became, stained, with, tobacco, juice, grass, and, mud, and, sometimes, the, juice, of, licorice, which, some, players, would, chew, for, the, purpose, of, discoloring, the, ball, also, pitchers, could, manipulate, the, ball, through, the, use, of, the, spitball, in, 1921, use, of, this, pitch, was, restricted, to, a, few, pitchers, with, a, grandfather, clause, additionally, many, ballparks, had, large, dimensions, such, as, the, west, side, grounds, of, the, chicago, cubs, which, was, 560, feet, 170, m, to, the, center, field, fence, and, the, huntington, avenue, grounds, of, the, boston, red, sox, which, was, 635, feet, 194, m, to, the, center, field, fence, thus, home, runs, were, rare, and, small, ball, tactics, such, as, singles, bunts, stolen, bases, and, the, hit, and, run, play, dominated, the, strategies, of, the, time, hitting, methods, like, the, baltimore, chop, were, used, to, increase, the, number, of, infield, singles, on, a, successful, baltimore, chop, the, batter, hits, the, ball, forcefully, into, the, ground, causing, it, to, bounce, so, high, that, the, batter, reaches, first, base, before, the, ball, can, be, fielded, and, thrown, to, the, first, baseman, the, adoption, of, the, foul, strike, rule, in, the, nl, in, 1901, in, the, al, two, years, later, quickly, sent, baseball, from, a, high, scoring, game, to, one, where, scoring, runs, became, a, struggle, before, this, rule, foul, balls, were, not, counted, as, strikes, a, batter, could, foul, off, any, number, of, pitches, with, no, strikes, counted, against, him, this, gave, an, enormous, advantage, to, the, batter, after, the, 1919, world, series, between, the, chicago, white, sox, and, cincinnati, reds, baseball, was, rocked, by, allegations, of, a, game, fixing, scheme, known, as, the, black, sox, scandal, eight, players, shoeless, joe, jackson, eddie, cicotte, claude, lefty, williams, george, buck, weaver, arnold, chick, gandil, fred, mcmullin, charles, swede, risberg, and, oscar, happy, felsch, intentionally, lost, the, world, series, in, exchange, for, a, ring, worth, 100, 000, 1, 712, 780, 35, in, 2022, dollars, despite, being, acquitted, all, were, permanently, banned, from, major, league, baseball, baseball, s, popularity, increased, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, the, 1920, season, was, notable, for, the, death, of, ray, chapman, of, the, cleveland, indians, chapman, who, was, struck, in, the, head, by, a, pitch, and, died, a, few, hours, later, became, the, only, mlb, player, to, die, of, an, on, field, injury, both, leagues, quickly, began, to, require, the, use, of, new, white, baseballs, whenever, a, ball, became, scuffed, or, dirty, helping, bring, the, dead, ball, era, to, an, end, the, following, year, the, new, york, yankees, made, their, first, world, series, appearance, by, the, end, of, the, 1930s, the, team, had, appeared, in, 11, world,

at, least, in, part, to, a, 10, federal, amusement, tax, added, to, baseball, ticket, prices, baseball, owners, cut, their, rosters, from, 25, men, to, 23, and, even, the, best, players, took, pay, cuts, team, executives, were, innovative, in, their, attempts, to, survive, creating, night, games, broadcasting, games, live, by, radio, and, rolling, out, promotions, such, as, free, admission, for, women, throughout, the, great, depression, no, mlb, teams, moved, or, folded, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, created, a, shortage, of, professional, baseball, players, as, more, than, 500, men, left, mlb, teams, to, serve, in, the, military, many, of, them, played, on, service, baseball, teams, that, entertained, military, personnel, in, the, us, or, in, the, pacific, mlb, teams, of, this, time, largely, consisted, of, young, men, older, players, and, those, with, a, military, classification, of, 4f, indicating, mental, physical, or, moral, unsuitability, for, service, men, like, pete, gray, a, one, armed, outfielder, got, the, chance, to, advance, to, the, major, leagues, however, mlb, rosters, did, not, include, any, black, players, through, the, end, of, the, war, black, players, many, of, whom, served, in, the, war, were, still, restricted, to, playing, negro, league, baseball, wartime, blackout, restrictions, designed, to, keep, outdoor, lighting, at, low, levels, caused, another,

mountain, landis, wrote, to, u, s, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, pleading, for, the, continuation, of, baseball, during, the, war, roosevelt, responded, i, honestly, feel, that, it, would, be, best, for, the, country, to, keep, baseball, going, there, will, be, fewer, people, unemployed, and, everybody, will, work, longer, hours, and, harder, than, ever, before, and, that, means, that, they, ought, to, have, a, chance, for, recreation, and, for, taking, their, minds, off, their, work, even, more, than, before, with, the, approval, of, president, roosevelt, spring, training, began, in, 1942, with, few, repercussions, the, war, interrupted, the, careers, of, stars, including, stan, musial, bob, feller, ted, williams, and, joe, dimaggio, but, baseball, clubs, continued, to, field, their, teams, branch, rickey, president, and, general, manager, of, the, brooklyn, dodgers, began, making, efforts, to, introduce, a, black, baseball, player, to, the, previously, all, white,

since, dizzy, dean, in, 1934, st, louis, cardinals, starting, pitcher, bob, gibson, achieved, an, equally, remarkable, feat, by, allowing, an, era, of, just, 1, 12, following, these, pitching, performances, in, december, 1968, the, mlb, playing, rules, committee, voted, to, reduce, the, strike, zone, from, knees, to, shoulders, to, top, of, knees, to, armpits, and, lower, the, pitcher, s,

increase, scoring, even, further, by, initiating, the, designated, hitter, dh, rule, throughout, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, as, baseball, expanded, nfl, football, had, been, surging, in, popularity, making, it, economical, for, many, of, these, cities, to, build, multi, purpose, stadiums, instead, of, single, purpose, baseball, fields, because, of, climate, and, economic, issues, many, of, these, facilities, had, playing, surfaces, made, from, artificial, turf, as, well, as, the, oval, designs, characteristic, of, stadiums, designed, to, house, both, baseball, and, football, this, often, resulted, in, baseball, fields, with, relatively, more, foul, territory, than, older, stadiums, these, characteristics, changed, the, nature, of, professional, baseball, putting, a, higher, premium, on, speed, and, defense, over, home, run, hitting, power, since, the, fields, were, often, too, big, for, teams, to, expect, to, hit, many, home, runs, and, foul, balls, hit, in, the, air, could, more, easily, be, caught, for, outs, teams, began, to, be, built, around, pitching, particularly, their, bullpens, and, speed, on, the, basepaths, artificial, surfaces, meant, balls, traveled, quicker, and, bounced, higher, so, it, became, easier, to, hit, ground, balls, in, the, hole, between, the, corner, and, middle, infielders, starting, pitchers, were, no, longer, expected, to, throw, complete, games, it, was, enough, for, a, starter, to, pitch, 6, 7, innings, and, turn, the, game, over, to, the, team, s, closer, a, position, which, grew, in, importance, over, these, decades, as, stolen, bases, increased, home, run, totals, dropped, after, willie, mays, hit, 52, home, runs, in, 1965, only, one, player, george, foster, reached, that, mark, until, the, 1990s, during, the, 1980s, baseball, experienced, a, number, of, significant, changes, the, game, had, not, seen, in, years, home, runs, were, on, the, decline, throughout, the, decade, with, players, hitting, only, 40, home, runs, just, 13, times, and, no, one, hitting, more, than, 50, home, runs, in, a, season, for, the, first, time, since, the, dead, ball, era, 1900, 1919, the, 1981, major, league, baseball, strike, from, june, 12, until, july, 31, forced, the, cancellation, of, 713, total, games, and, resulted, in, a, split, season, format, in, 1985, pete, rose, broke, ty, cobb, s, all, time, hits, record, with, his, 4, 192nd, hit, and, in, 1989, rose, received, a, lifetime, ban, from, baseball, as, a, result, of, betting, on, baseball, games, while, manager, of, the, cincinnati, reds, rose, was, the, first, person, to, receive, a, lifetime, ban, from, baseball, since, 1943, 1985, also, saw, the, pittsburgh, drug, trials, which, involved, players, who, were, called, to, testify, before, a, grand, jury, in, pittsburgh, related, to, cocaine, trafficking, the, 1994, 95, major, league, baseball, strike, from, august, 12, 1994, to, april, 25, 1995, caused, the, cancellation, of, over, 900, games, and, the, forfeit, of, the, entire, 1994, postseason, routinely, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, baseball, players, hit, 40, or, 50, home, runs, in, a, season, a, feat, that, was, considered, rare, even, in, the, 1980s, it, later, became, apparent, that, at, least, some, of, this, power, surge, was, a, result, of, players, using, steroids, and, other, performance, enhancing, drugs, in, 1993, the, national, league, added, the, florida, marlins, in, miami, and, the, colorado, rockies, in, denver, in, 1998, the, brewers, switched, leagues, by, joining, the, national, league, and, two, new, teams, were, added, the, national, league, s, arizona, diamondbacks, in, phoenix, and, the, american, league, s, tampa, bay, devil, rays, in, tampa, bay, after, the, 2001, season, the, team, owners, voted, in, favor, of, contraction, several, mlb, teams, had, been, considered, for, elimination, in, early, talks, about, contraction, but, the, montreal, expos, and, the, minnesota, twins, were, the, two, teams, that, came, closest, to, folding, under, the, plan, plans, for, mlb, contraction, were, halted, when, the, twins, landlord, was, awarded, a, court, injunction, that, required, the, team, to, play, its, 2002, home, games, at, their, stadium, mlb, owners, agreed, to, hold, off, on, reducing, the, league, s, size, until, at, least, 2006, the, montreal, expos, became, the, first, franchise, in, over, three, decades, to, move, when, they, became, the, washington, nationals, in, 2005, this, move, left, canada, with, just, one, team, but, it, also, returned, baseball, to, washington, after, a, 33, year, absence, this, franchise, shift, like, many, previous, ones, involved, baseball, s, return, to, a, city, that, had, been, previously, abandoned, not, counting, the, short, lived, federal, league, montreal, is, the, only, city, to, host, an, mlb, franchise, since, 1901, that, as, of, december, 2023, does, not, have, a, team, in, recent, years, with, the, advent, of, technologies, such, as, statcast, and, its, use, of, hawk, eye, starting, in, 2020, as, well, as, with, advanced, statistics, as, provided, by, sites, such, as, fangraphs, and, baseball, savant, mlb, has, evolved, with, the, ability, to, see, precise, movements, of, pitchers, and, batters, teams, can, assess, the, mechanics, of, a, player, and, help, them, improve, statcast, also, provides, some, features, such, as, tracking, the, paths, of, most, batted, balls, tracking, the, speed, of, most, batted, balls, and, tracking, the, exit, velocity, of, most, batted, balls, statcast, has, allowed, for, advanced, defensive, analytics, that, have, not, been, possible, before, tracking, of, players, due, to, how, subjective, fielding, can, be, the, rate, of, teams, using, a, defensive, shift, has, gone, up, from, 13, 7, in, 2016, to, 33, 6, in, 2022, because, advanced, statistics, support, this, as, an, effective, way, to, stop, hitters, from, getting, hits, because, the, shift, reduces, the, number, of, balls, in, play, that, result, in, hits, and, mlb, wishes, to, increase, interest, in, baseball, mlb, announced, in, september, 2022, that, extreme, infield, defensive, shifts, would, be, banned, starting, in, 2023, in, order, to, be, compliant, there, must, be, two, fielders, on, each, side, of, second, base, and, those, fielders, must, have, both, of, their, feet, on, the, infield, dirt, at, the, time, the, pitch, is, thrown, if, this, rule, is, not, followed, the, choice, of, an, automatic, ball, or, the, outcome, of, the, play, is, given, to, the, batting, team, the, game, of, baseball, has, also, slowed, down, significantly, due, to, an, increased, number, of, strikeouts, and, walks, two, outcomes, that, generally, take, many, pitches, to, complete, and, an, increased, amount, of, time, taken, for, a, pitcher, to, pitch, in, 2020, it, took, an, average, of, three, hours, and, six, minutes, to, complete, a, 9, inning, game, a, number, which, has, steadily, ticked, up, for, years, along, with, the, restrictions, on, defensive, shifts, mlb, announced, the, introduction, of, a, pitch, clock, for, the, 2023, season, and, beyond, which, is, something, that, has, been, an, experiment, in, milb, for, a, few, years, the, pitch, clock, starts, at, 15, seconds, by, the, time, the, clock, reaches, 10, seconds, the, catcher, must, be, in, their, crouch, behind, home, plate, when, the, clock, reaches, 8, seconds, the, batter, must, be, in, the, batter, s, box, and, be, alert, before, the, 15, second, timer, reaches, 0, seconds, the, pitcher, must, have, started, their, motion, to, pitch, if, any, of, these, deadlines, are, violated, the, count, of, the, batter, will, be, increased, by, one, ball, if, the, defending, team, violated, the, pitch, clock, or, one, strike, if, it, is, the, offensive, team, who, violated, the, pitch, clock, additionally, in, order, to, prevent, circumventing, these, rules, pickoffs, and, step, offs, which, reset, the, pitch, clock, are, only, allowed, two, times, total, per, plate, appearance, and, if, a, pitcher, attempts, a, third, pickoff, and, fails, to, get, the, runner, out, a, balk, will, be, called, similarly, a, batter, is, restricted, to, calling, a, timeout, an, action, which, resets, the, pitch, clock, just, once, per, plate, appearance, in, 2019, major, league,
