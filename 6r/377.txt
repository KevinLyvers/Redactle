by, 1803, at, rugby, school, and, by, the, 1830s, running, in, with, the, ball, in, hand, was, allowed, but, subject, to, hacking, and, collaring, former, rugby, school, student, albert, pell, is, credited, with, having, formed, the, first, football, team, while, a, student, at, cambridge, university, major, private, schools, each, used, different, rules, during, this, early, period, with, former, pupils, from, rugby, and, eton, attempting, to, carry, their, preferred, rules, through, to, their, universities, a, significant, event, in, the, early, development, of, rugby, football, was, the, production, of, a, written, set, of, rules, at, rugby, school, in, 1845, followed, by, the, cambridge, rules, that, were, drawn, up, in, 1848, formed, in, 1863, the, national, governing, body, the, football, association, fa, began, codifying, a, set, of, universal, football, rules, these, new, rules, specifically, banned, players, from, running, with, the, ball, in, hand, and, also, disallowed, hacking, kicking, players, in, the, shins, both, of, which, were, legal, and, common, tactics, under, the, rugby, school, s, rules, of, the, sport, in, protest, at, the, imposition, of, the, new, rules, the, blackheath, club, left, the, fa, followed, by, several, other, clubs, that, also, favoured, the, rugby, rules, although, these, clubs, decided, to, ban, hacking, soon, afterwards, the, split, was, permanent, and, the, fa, s, codified, rules, became, known, as, association, football, whilst, the, clubs, that, had, favoured, the, rugby, rules, formed, the, rugby, football, union, in, 1871, and, their, code, became, known, as, rugby, football, in, 1895, there, was, a, major, schism, within, rugby, football, in, england, in, which, numerous, clubs, from, northern, england, resigned, from, the, rfu, over, the, issue, of, reimbursing, players, for, time, lost, from, their, workplaces, the, split, highlighted, the, social, and, class, divisions, in, the, sport, in, england, although, the, rules, of, the, game, were, not, a, factor, in, the, split, the, breakaway, teams, subsequently, adopted, some, rule, changes, and, this, became, the, separate, code, of, rugby, league, the, rfu, s, code, thereafter, took, on, the, name, rugby, union, to, differentiate, it, from, rugby, league, but, both, versions, of, the, sport, are, known, simply, as, rugby, throughout, most, of, the, world, the, first, rugby, football, international, was, played, on, 27, march, 1871, between, scotland, and, england, in, edinburgh, scotland, won, the, game, by, one, goal, and, one, try, to, one, goal, by, 1881, both, ireland, and, wales, had, representative, teams, and, in, 1883, the, first, international, competition, the, home, nations, championship, had, begun, 1883, is, also, the, year, of, the, first, rugby, sevens, tournament, the, melrose, sevens, which, is, still, held, annually, two, important, overseas, tours, took, place, in, 1888, a, british, isles, team, visited, australia, and, new, zealand, although, a, private, venture, it, laid, the, foundations, for, future, british, and, irish, lions, tours, and, the, 1888, 89, new, zealand, native, football, team, brought, the, first, overseas, team, to, british, spectators, during, the, early, history, of, rugby, union, a, time, before, commercial, air, travel, teams, from, different, continents, rarely, met, the, first, two, notable, tours, both, took, place, in, 1888, the, british, isles, team, touring, new, zealand, and, australia, followed, by, the, new, zealand, team, touring, europe, traditionally, the, most, prestigious, tours, were, the, southern, hemisphere, countries, of, australia, new, zealand, and, south, africa, making, a, tour, of, a, northern, hemisphere, and, the, return, tours, made, by, a, joint, british, and, irish, team, tours, would, last, for, months, due, to, long, traveling, times, and, the, number, of, games, undertaken, the, 1888, new, zealand, team, began, their, tour, in, hawkes, bay, in, june, and, did, not, complete, their, schedule, until, august, 1889, having, played, 107, rugby, matches, touring, international, sides, would, play, test, matches, against, international, opponents, including, national, club, and, county, sides, in, the, case, of, northern, hemisphere, rugby, or, provincial, state, sides, in, the, case, of, southern, hemisphere, rugby, between, 1905, and, 1908, all, three, major, southern, hemisphere, rugby, countries, sent, their, first, touring, teams, to, the, northern, hemisphere, new, zealand, in, 1905, followed, by, south, africa, in, 1906, and, australia, in, 1908, all, three, teams, brought, new, styles, of, play, fitness, levels, and, tactics, and, were, far, more, successful, than, critics, had, expected, the, new, zealand, 1905, touring, team, performed, a, haka, before, each, match, leading, welsh, rugby, union, administrator, tom, williams, to, suggest, that, wales, player, teddy, morgan, lead, the, crowd, in, singing, the, welsh, national, anthem, hen, wlad, fy, nhadau, as, a, response, after, morgan, began, singing, the, crowd, joined, in, the, first, time, a, national, anthem, was, sung, at, the, start, of, a, sporting, event, in, 1905, france, played, england, in, its, first, international, match, rugby, union, was, included, as, an, event, in, the, olympic, games, four, times, during, the, early, 20th, century, no, international, rugby, games, and, union, sponsored, club, matches, were, played, during, the, first, world, war, but, competitions, continued, through, service, teams, such, as, the, new, zealand, army, team, during, the, second, world, war, no, international, matches, were, played, by, most, countries, though, italy, germany, and, romania, played, a, limited, number, of, games, and, cambridge, and, oxford, continued, their, annual, university, match, the, first, officially, sanctioned, international, rugby, sevens, tournament, took, place, in, 1973, at, murrayfield, one, of, scotland, s, biggest, stadiums, as, part, of, the, scottish, rugby, union, centenary, celebrations, in, 1987, the, first, rugby, world,

was, introduced, into, the, commonwealth, games, in, 1998, and, was, added, to, the, olympic, games, of, 2016, both, men, and, women, s, sevens, took, place, at, the, 2020, olympic, games, in, tokyo, rugby, union, was, an, amateur, sport, until, the, irb, declared, the, game, open, in, august, 1995, shortly, after, the, completion, of, the, 1995, world, cup, removing, restrictions, on, payments, to, players, however, the, pre, 1995, period, of, rugby, union, was, marked, by, frequent, accusations, of, shamateurism, including, an, investigation, in, britain, by, a, house, of, commons, select, committee, in, early, 1995, following, the, introduction, of, professionalism, trans, national, club, competitions, were, started, with, the, heineken, cup, in, the, northern, hemisphere, and, super, rugby, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, tri, nations, an, annual, international, tournament, involving, australia, new, zealand, and, south, africa, kicked, off, in, 1996, in, 2012, this, competition, was, extended, to, include, argentina, a, country, whose, impressive, performances, in, international, games, especially, finishing, in, third, place, in, the, 2007, rugby, world, cup, was, deemed, to, merit, inclusion, in, the, competition, as, a, result, of, the, expansion, to, four, teams, the, tournament, was, renamed, the, rugby, championship, each, team, starts, the, match, with, 15, players, on, the, field, and, typically, seven, or, eight, substitutes, but, this, varies, at, amateur, level, the, 15, players, on, the, field, are, divided, into, eight, forwards, two, more, than, in, rugby, league, and, seven, backs, there, are, typically, significantly, more, forwards, on, the, bench, than, backs, with, for, example, south, africa, having, a, 7, 1, split, in, favour, of, forwards, in, their, august, 2023, match, against, new, zealand, in, twickenham, a, 6, 2, or, 5, 3, split, is, more, common, the, main, responsibilities, of, the, forward, players, are, to, gain, and, retain, possession, of, the, ball, forwards, play, a, vital, role, in, tackling, and, rucking, opposing, players, players, in, these, positions, are, generally, bigger, and, stronger, and, take, part, in, the, scrum, and, line, out, the, forwards, are, often, collectively, referred, to, as, the, pack, especially, when, in, the, scrum, formation, the, front, row, consists, of, three, players, two, props, the, loosehead, prop, and, the, tighthead, prop, and, the, hooker, the, role, of, the, two, props, is, to, support, the, hooker, during, scrums, to, provide, support, for, the, jumpers, during, line, outs, and, to, provide, strength, and, power, in, rucks, and, mauls, the, third, position, in, the, front, row, is, the, hooker, the, hooker, is, a, key, position, in, attacking, and, defensive, play, and, is, responsible, for, winning, the, ball, in, the, scrum, hookers, normally, throw, the, ball, in, at, line, outs, the, second, row, consists, of, two, locks, or, lock, forwards, locks, are, usually, the, tallest, players, in, the, team, and, specialise, as, line, out, jumpers, the, main, role, of, the, lock, in, line, outs, is, to, make, a, standing, jump, often, supported, by, the, other, forwards, to, either, collect, the, thrown, ball, or, ensure, the, ball, comes, down, on, their, side, locks, also, have, an, important, role, in, the, scrum, binding, directly, behind, the, three, front, row, players, and, providing, forward, drive, the, back, row, not, to, be, confused, with, backs, is, the, third, and, final, row, of, the, forward, positions, who, are, often, referred, to, as, the, loose, forwards, the, three, positions, in, the, back, row, are, the, two, flankers, and, the, number, 8, the, two, flanker, positions, known, as, the, blindside, flanker, and, openside, flanker, are, the, final, row, in, the, scrum, they, are, usually, the, most, mobile, forwards, in, the, game, their, main, role, is, to, win, possession, through, turn, overs, the, number, 8, packs, down, between, the, two, locks, at, the, back, of, the, scrum, the, role, of, the, number, 8, in, the, scrum, is, to, control, the, ball, after, it, has, been, heeled, back, from, the, front, of, the, pack, and, the, position, provides, a, link, between, the, forwards, and, backs, during, attacking, phases, the, role, of, the, backs, is, to, create, and, convert, point, scoring, opportunities, they, are, generally, smaller, faster, and, more, agile, than, the, forwards, another, distinction, between, the, backs, and, the, forwards, is, that, the, backs, are, expected, to, have, superior, kicking, and, ball, handling, skills, especially, the, fly, half, scrum, half, and, full, back, the, half, backs, consist, of, two, positions, the, scrum, half, and, the, fly, half, also, known, in, the, southern, hemisphere, as, half, back, and, first, five, eighth, respectively, the, fly, half, is, crucial, to, a, team, s, game, plan, orchestrating, the, team, s, performance, they, are, usually, the, first, to, receive, the, ball, from, the, scrum, half, following, a, breakdown, lineout, or, scrum, and, need, to, be, decisive, with, what, actions, to, take, and, be, effective, at, communicating, with, the, outside, backs, many, fly, halves, are, also, their, team, s, goal, kickers, the, scrum, half, is, the, link, between, the, forwards, and, the, backs, they, receive, the, ball, from, the, lineout, and, remove, the, ball, from, the, back, of, the, scrum, usually, passing, it, to, the, fly, half, they, also, feed, the, scrum, and, sometimes, have, to, act, as, a, fourth, loose, forward, there, are, four, three, quarter, positions, two, centres, inside, and, outside, and, two, wings, left, and, right, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, inside, centre, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, second, five, eighth, while, the, outside, centre, is, simply, known, as, the, centre, the, centres, will, attempt, to, tackle, attacking, players, whilst, in, attack, they, should, employ, speed, and, strength, to, breach, opposition, defences, the, wings, are, generally, positioned, on, the, outside, of, the, backline, their, primary, function, is, to, finish, off, moves, and, score, tries, wings, are, usually, the, fastest, players, in, the, team, and, are, elusive, runners, who, use, their, speed, to, avoid, tackles, the, full, back, is, normally, positioned, several, metres, behind, the, back, line, they, often, field, opposition, kicks, and, are, usually, the, last, line, of, defence, should, an, opponent, break, through, the, back, line, two, of, the, most, important, attributes, of, a, good, full, back, are, dependable, catching, skills, and, a, good, kicking, game, rugby, union, is, played, between, two, teams, the, one, that, scores, more, points, wins, the, game, points, can, be, scored, in, several, ways, a, try, scored, by, grounding, the, ball, in, the, in, goal, area, between, the, goal, line, and, the, dead, ball, line, is, worth, 5, points, and, a, subsequent, conversion, kick, scores, 2, points, a, successful, penalty, kick, or, a, drop, goal, each, score, 3, points, the, values, of, each, of, these, scoring, methods, have, been, changed, over, the, years, according, to, world, rugby, s, laws, of, the, game, a, typical, rugby, ground, formally, known, as, the, playing, enclosure, is, formed, by, two, major, zones, the, referee, and, their, assistants, generally, have, full, authority, and, responsibility, for, all, players, and, other, officials, inside, the, playing, enclosure, fences, or, ropes, particularly, at, amateur, clubs, are, generally, used, to, mark, the, extent, of, this, area, although, in, modern, stadia, this, may, include, the, entire, arena, floor, or, other, designated, space, the, laws, above, all, require, that, the, playing, enclosure, s, surface, be, safe, whilst, also, permitting, grass, sand, clay, snow, or, conforming, artificial, turf, to, be, used, the, surface, would, generally, be, uniform, across, both, the, playing, area, and, perimeter, area, although, depending, on, how, large, the, perimeter, is, other, surfaces, such, as, dirt, artificial, turf, etc, may, be, used, outside, of, a, sliding, perimeter, from, the, bounds, of, the, playing, area, for, the, most, part, the, playing, area, is, where, the, majority, of, play, occurs, the, ball, is, generally, considered, live, whilst, in, this, area, so, long, as, players, do, not, infringe, with, special, rules, applied, to, specific, zones, of, the, playing, area, the, playing, area, consists, of, a, typical, field, of, play, is, generally, 100, metres, long, by, 68, 70, metres, wide, for, senior, rugby, depending, on, the, specific, requirements, of, each, ground, the, laws, require, the, field, of, play, to, be, between, 94, and, 100, metres, 103, and, 109, yards, long, with, a, width, of, between, 68, and, 70, metres, 74, and, 77, yards, as, other, football, codes, such, as, association, football, and, rugby, league, have, specified, a, preferred, or, standard, 68, metre, width, this, is, often, used, unless, a, ground, has, been, specifically, designed, to, accommodate, a, 70, metre, rugby, field, 100, metres, is, the, typical, length, with, a, line, see, below, often, marked, at, halfway, with, 50, on, it, representing, 50, metres, from, each, goal, line, the, variations, have, been, allowed, in, the, laws, possibly, to, accommodate, older, grounds, perhaps, even, pre, metrification, when, yards, and, feet, were, specified, and, developing, nations, the, field, of, play, is, divided, by, a, solid, halfway, line, drawn, perpendicular, to, the, sidelines, at, their, midpoint, a, 0, 5m, line, is, marked, perpendicular, to, the, halfway, lines, at, its, midpoint, designating, the, spot, where, the, kickoffs, shall, be, taken, the, areas, between, each, goal, line, and, the, halfway, line, are, known, as, halves, as, in, other, football, codes, a, pair, of, solid, lines, are, also, drawn, perpendicular, to, the, sidelines, 22, metres, formerly, 25, yards, from, each, end, of, the, field, of, play, and, called, the, 22, metre, lines, or, 22, s, an, area, at, each, end, also, known, as, the, 22, is, bounded, by, but, does, not, include, the, sidelines, goal, line, and, 22, metre, line, in, this, area, a, defensive, player, who, cleanly, catches, a, ball, kicked, by, the, other, team, without, the, ball, having, already, touched, the, ground, after, the, kick, is, entitled, to, claim, a, free, kick, or, mark, additionally, if, the, ball, is, kicked, into, touch, by, a, player, who, had, at, least, one, foot, on, or, behind, their, own, 22, metre, line, the, line, out, formed, at, the, spot, where, the, ball, crossed, the, touch, line, instead, of, being, taken, in, line, with, the, spot, from, where, it, was, kicked, additional, broken, or, dashed, lines, of, 5, metre, dash, lengths, according, to, the, laws, are, drawn, in, each, half, or, on, each, side, of, the, field, each, with, specific, purposes, under, the, laws, generally, points, where, the, dashed, lines, intersect, other, lines, will, be, marked, with, a, t, or, cross, shape, although, the, extensions, of, dashed, lines, are, generally, not, drawn, within, 5, metres, of, the, goal, lines, or, sidelines, to, allow, a, clear, demarcation, of, the, field, of, play, s, boundaries, the, laws, require, the, playing, area, to, be, rectangular, in, shape, however, variations, may, be, permitted, with, the, approval, of, relevant, unions, a, notable, example, is, chatswood, oval, in, sydney, australia, an, elliptically, shaped, cricket, ground, which, is, the, home, of, gordon, rugby, club, that, has, curved, dead, ball, lines, to, maximise, the, available, in, goal, space, where, multiple, sports, share, a, field, e, g, a, rugby, league, and, a, rugby, union, club, sharing, one, field, lines, may, be, overlaid, on, top, of, each, other, sometimes, in, different, colours, however, particularly, for, television, rugby, union, line, markings, are, generally, painted, white, some, exceptions, include, the, wallabies, australia, s, national, team, who, often, have, yellow, markings, local, clubs, may, use, black, yellow, or, other, colours, on, grass, with, other, surfaces, possibly, requiring, different, marking, techniques, unlike, association, football, where, on, field, advertising, is, strictly, forbidden, in, the, laws, world, rugby, allows, sponsors, logos, to, be, painted, on, the, playing, surface, this, is, another, way, in, which, clubs, can, make, money, in, the, professional, era, and, is, also, often, used, by, host, nations, professional, leagues, and, tournaments, as, additional, revenue, streams, particularly, when, games, are, broadcast, in, recent, years, augmented, reality, technology, has, been, used, to, replace, painting, to, protect, the, surface, or, save, costs, on, painting, fields, producing, a, similar, effect, for, broadcast, albeit, sometimes, with, poorer, results, the, in, goal, areas, sit, behind, the, goal, lines, equivalent, to, american, football, s, end, zones, the, in, goal, areas, must, be, between, 6, and, 22, metres, 6, 6, and, 24, 1, yards, deep, and, cover, the, full, width, of, the, field, a, ball, grounded, in, this, area, by, an, attacking, player, will, generally, result, in, a, try, being, awarded, unless, there, has, been, a, previous, infringement, or, the, player, has, gone, out, of, bounds, whilst, in, possession, of, the, ball, the, perimeter, area, is, considered, out, of, bounds, for, the, ball, and, the, players, normally, resulting, in, the, non, infringing, team, receiving, possession, of, the, ball, at, a, restart, the, perimeter, area, can, be, divided, into, two, areas, for, the, purposes, of, determining, if, a, ball, is, out, of, bounds, i, e, has, left, the, playing, area, the, perimeter, area, extends, indefinitely, away, from, the, playing, area, when, a, ball, or, player, goes, into, touch, a, lineout, throw, is, generally, awarded, to, the, opposition, at, the, spot, on, the, sideline, where, they, left, the, field, exceptions, include, a, kick, out, on, the, full, i, e, the, ball, did, not, land, in, the, field, of, play, before, going, into, touch, in, which, case, the, lineout, would, still, take, place, on, the, sideline, but, back, in, line, with, where, the, ball, was, kicked, or, when, a, team, takes, a, free, kick, from, a, penalty, where, they, would, retain, the, right, to, throw, in, the, perimeter, area, should, be, clear, and, free, of, obstructions, and, heavy, solid, objects, which, could, pose, a, danger, to, players, for, at, least, 5, metres, from, the, playing, area, according, to, the, laws, players, often, leave, the, playing, area, whether, accidentally, or, due, to, being, forced, off, of, the,
