nobility, often, used, their, arms, on, heraldic, china, the, final, replacement, of, silver, tableware, with, porcelain, as, the, norm, in, french, aristocratic, dining, had, taken, place, by, the, 1770s, after, this, the, enormous, development, of, european, porcelain, and, cheaper, fine, earthenwares, like, faience, and, creamware, as, well, as, the, resumption, of, large, imports, of, chinese, export, porcelain, often, armorial, porcelain, decorated, to, order, led, to, matching, china, services, becoming, affordable, by, an, ever, wider, public, by, 1800, cheap, versions, of, these, were, often, brightly, decorated, with, transfer, printing, in, blue, and, were, beginning, to, be, affordable, by, the, better, off, working, class, household, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, american, market, was, largely, served, by, imports, from, britain, with, some, from, china, and, the, european, continent, the, introduction, to, europe, of, hot, drinks, mostly, but, not, only, tea, and, coffee, as, a, regular, feature, of, eating, and, entertaining, led, to, a, new, class, of, tableware, in, its, most, common, material, various, types, of, ceramics, this, is, often, called, teaware, it, developed, in, the, late, 17th, century, and, for, some, time, the, serving, pots, milk, jugs, and, sugar, bowls, were, often, in, silver, while, the, cups, and, saucers, were, ceramic, often, in, chinese, export, porcelain, or, its, japanese, equivalent, by, the, mid, 18th, century, matching, sets, of, european, china, were, usual, for, all, the, vessels, although, these, often, did, not, include, plates, for, cake, etc, until, the, next, century, this, move, to, local, china, was, rather, delayed, by, the, tendency, of, some, early, types, of, european, soft, paste, porcelain, to, break, if, too, hot, liquid, was, poured, into, it, the, knife, is, the, oldest, type, of, cutlery, early, ones, were, normally, carried, by, the, individual, at, all, times, forks, and, spoons, came, later, and, are, initially, only, for, the, wealthy, who, typically, carried, their, own, personal, set, after, the, romans, who, made, great, use, of, spoons, joined, by, forks, later, there, were, only, knives, and, perhaps, wooden, spoons, for, most, of, the, middle, ages, it, was, only, in, the, 17th, century, that, hosts, among, the, elite, again, began, to, lay, out, cutlery, at, the, table, although, at, an, italian, banquet, in, 1536, for, charles, v, holy, roman, emperor, it, is, recorded, that, each, guest, was, provided, with, knife, spoon, and, fork, evidently, a, rarity, the, table, fork, was, revived, in, italy, in, the, 16th, century, and, was, described, for, his, english, readers, by, thomas, coryat, in, the, 1590s, as, not, used, in, any, other, country, that, i, saw, in, my, travels, in, england, and, france, it, only, became, common, after, the, 1660s, even, in, the, court, of, louis, xiv, and, for, a, while, seems, to, have, mostly, been, used, by, ladies, and, for, especially, messy, food, like, fruits, in, syrup, chopsticks, chinese, or, pinyin, kuaizi, or, zhu, are, shaped, pairs, of, equal, length, sticks, that, have, been, used, as, both, kitchen, and, eating, utensils, in, much, of, east, and, southeast, asia, for, over, three, millennia, traditionally, wood, especially, bamboo, although, other, materials, such, as, plastic, or, metal, are, also, used, usually, they, have, a, square, profile, at, the, slightly, thicker, end, held, in, the, hand, but, are, round, at, the, other, end, that, touches, the, food, chopsticks, have, been, used, since, at, least, the, shang, dynasty, 1766, 1122, bce, however, the, han, dynasty, historian, sima, qian, wrote, that, it, is, likely, that, chopsticks, were, also, used, in, the, preceding, xia, dynasty, and, even, the, earlier, erlitou, culture, although, finding, archeological, evidence, from, this, era, is, incredibly, difficult, though, originating, in, china, chopsticks, later, spread, to, japan, korea, tibet, vietnam, and, other, parts, of, asia, chopsticks, have, become, more, accepted, in, connection, with, asian, food, in, the, west, especially, in, cities, with, significant, asian, diaspora, communities, tableware, is, generally, the, functional, part, of, the, settings, on, dining, tables, but, great, attention, has, been, paid, to, the,
