states, when, the, heat, source, for, grilling, comes, from, above, grilling, is, called, broiling, in, this, case, the, pan, that, holds, the, food, is, called, a, broiler, pan, and, heat, transfer, is, through, thermal, radiation, direct, heat, grilling, can, expose, food, to, temperatures, often, in, excess, of, 260, c, 500, f, grilled, meat, acquires, a, distinctive, roast, aroma, and, flavor,

after, the, braising, effectively, cooking, the, meat, three, times, which, results, in, a, soft, textured, product, that, falls, right, off, the, bone, this, method, of, cooking, is, slower, than,

heating, element, is, circular, rather, than, straight, side, to, side, this, heating, technology, creates, an, extremely, hot, and, even, cooking, surface, as, heat, spreads, in, a, radial, fashion, over, the, surface, the, first, flattop, grills, originated, in, spain, and, are, known, as, planchas, or, la, plancha, food, that, is, cooked, a, la, plancha, means, grilled, on, a, metal, plate, plancha, griddles, or, flat, tops, are, chrome, plated, which, prevents, reaction, with, the, food, some, base, metal, griddles, will, impart, a, subtle, flavor, to, the, food, being, cooked, the, flattop, grill, is, a, versatile, platform, for, many, cooking, techniques, such, as, saut, ing, toasting, steaming, stir, frying, grilling, baking, braising, and, roasting, and, can, also, be, used, in, flamb, ing, in, addition, pots, and, pans, can, be, placed, directly, on, the, cooking, surface, for, even, more, cooking, flexibility, in, most, cases, the, steel, cooking, surface, is, seasoned, like, cast, iron, cookware, providing, a, natural, non, stick, surface, charbroiling, or, chargrilling, outside, north, america, refers, to, grilling, on, a, surface, with, wide, raised, ridges, to,

ridges, where, the, heat, can, be, applied, from, either, above, or, below, in, gas, and, electric, ovens, this, is, accomplished, with, a, heating, element, and, a, broil, pan, sometimes, the, food, is, placed, near, the, upper, heating, element, to, intensify, the, heat, the, lower, heating, element, may, or, may, not, be, left, off, and, the, oven, door, is, sometimes, opened, partially, gas, ovens, often, have, a, separate, compartment, for, broiling, sometimes, a, drawer, below, the, bottom, flame, a, salamander, also, salamander, oven, or, salamander, broiler, is, a, culinary, grill, characterized, by, very, high, temperature, overhead, electric, or, gas, heating, elements, it, is, used, primarily, in, professional, kitchens, for, overhead, grilling, it, is, also, used, for, toasting, browning, of, gratin, dishes, melting, cheeses, onto, sandwiches, and, caramelizing, desserts, such, as, cr, me, br, l, e, salamanders, are, generally, similar, to, an, oven, without, a, front, door, the, heating, element, is, at, the, top, they, are, also, more, compact, typically, only, half, the, height, and, depth, of, a, conventional, oven, for, convenience, they, are, often, wall, mounted, at, eye, level, enabling, easy, access, and, close, control, of, the, cooking, process, many, salamanders, can, be, fitted, with, a, cast, iron, branding, plate, which, is, used, to, make, grill, marks, on, the, surface, of, meat, some, grills, can, also, be, fitted, with, a, rotisserie, accessory, for, roasting, meats, overhead, heat, has, the, advantage, of, allowing, foods, containing, fats, such, as, steaks, chops, and, other, cuts, of, meat, to, be, grilled, without, the, risk, of, flare, ups, caused, by, the, rendered, fat, dripping, onto, the, heat, source, the, salamander, s, facility, for, extremely, high, temperature, also, takes, less, cooking, time, than, other, grilling, techniques, reducing, preparation, time, which, is, a, benefit, in, professional, kitchens, during, a, busy, meal, service, modern, salamanders, take, their, name, from, the, 18th, century, salamander, the, tool, of, choice, for, toasting, the, top, of, a, dish, it, consisted, of, a, thick, plate, of, iron, attached, to, the, end, of, a, long, handle, with, two, feet, or, rests, arranged, near, the, iron, plate, for, propping, the, plate, over, the, food, to, be, browned, its, name, in, turn, was, taken, from, the, legendary, salamander, a, mythical, amphibian, that, was, believed, to, be, immune, to, fire, some, commercial, devices, permit, the, simultaneous, grilling, of, both, sides, of, the, meat, at, the, same, time, the, flame, grilling, machine, at, burger, king, carl, s, jr, hardee, s, and, other, fast, food, restaurants, is, called, a, broiler, it, works, by, moving, meat, patties, along, a, chain, conveyor, belt, between, top, and, bottom, burners, grilling, both, sides, of, the, meat, patty, at, the, same, time, this, concept, was, invented, in, 1898, when, the, bridge, and, beach, co, of, st, louis, missouri, started, manufacturing, a, vertical, cast, iron, stove, these, stoves, were, designed, to, allow, the, meat, to, be, flame, broiled, flame, grilled, on, both, sides, at, the, same, time, custom, hinged, steel, wire, gridirons, were, built, for, use, in, the, vertical, broilers, the, hinged, gridirons, were, slid, in, and, out, of, the, stoves, holding, the, meat, while, it, cooked, evenly, on, both, sides, like, modern, day, oven, racks, these, stoves, took, up, a, small, amount, of, counter, space, they, were, used, in, lunch, spots, to, feed, factory, workers, during, the, 1990s, double, sided, grilling, was, popular, in, the, usa, using, consumer, electrical, grills, e, g, the, popular, george, foreman, grill, us, marketers, of, electric, double, sided, grilling, appliances, opted, for, the, global, term, grill, rather, than, the, geographically, isolated, term, broiler, hinged, double, sided, grills, are, generically, known, as, contact, grills, whole, grilling, involves, grilling, a, whole, carcass, as, opposed, to, grilling, individual, portion, sized, cuts, this, method, is, often, used, in, order, to, avoid, the, need, for, complicated, grill, equipment, during, for, example, a, hunt, or, expedition, in, the, wild, it, is, also, the, traditional, method, of, cooking, in, several, cultures, where, they, do, a, pig, roast, luau, or, barbacoa, there, are, several, primitive, methods, and, modern, equipment, that, copies, and, automates, the, primitive, version
