maintain, spirituality, and, culture, capoeira, has, been, practiced, among, black, brazilians, for, centuries, the, date, of, its, creation, is, unknown, but, it, was, first, mentioned, in, a, judicial, document, under, the, name, c, apoeiragem, in, 1789, as, the, gravest, of, crimes, in, the, 19th, century, a, street, fighting, style, called, capoeira, carioca, was, developed, it, was, repeatedly, outlawed, and, its, performers, persecuted, and, it, was, declared, totally, illegal, and, banned, in, 1890, in, the, early, 1930s, mestre, bimba, reformed, traditional, capoeira, and, incorporated, elements, of, jiujitsu, gymnastics, and, sports, as, a, result, the, government, viewed, capoeira, as, a, socially, acceptable, sport, in, 1941, mestre, pastinha, later, founded, his, school, where, he, cultivated, the, traditional, capoeira, angola, distinguishing, it, from, reformed, capoeira, as, the, brazilians, national, sport, in, the, late, 1970s, trailblazers, such, as, mestre, acordeon, started, bringing, capoeira, to, the, us, and, europe, helping, the, art, become, internationally, recognized, and, practiced, on, 26, november, 2014, capoeira, was, granted, a, special, protected, status, as, intangible, cultural, heritage, by, unesco, martial, arts, from, the, african, diaspora, similar, to, capoeira, include, knocking, and, kicking, from, the, sea, islands, and, ladya, from, martinique, both, of, which, likely, originate, from, engolo, in, the, past, many, participants, used, the, name, angola, or, the, term, brincar, de, angola, playing, angola, for, this, art, in, police, documents, capoeira, was, known, as, capoeiragem, with, a, practitioner, being, called, capoeira, gradually, the, art, became, known, as, capoeira, with, a, practitioner, being, called, a, capoeirista, in, a, narrower, sense, capoeiragem, meant, a, set, of, fighting, skills, the, term, jogo, de, capoeira, capoeira, game, is, used, to, describe, the, art, in, the, performative, context, although, debated, the, most, widely, accepted, origin, of, the, word, capoeira, comes, from, the, tupi, words, ka, a, forest, pa, round, referring, to, the, areas, of, low, vegetation, in, the, brazilian, interior, where, fugitive, slaves, would, hide, well, there, is, one, thing, that, nobody, doubts, the, ones, to, teach, capoeira, to, us, were, the, negro, slaves, that, were, brought, from, angola, in, the, past, some, participants, used, the, name, angola, or, the, term, brincar, de, angola, playing, angola, for, this, art, in, formal, documents, capoeira, was, known, as, capoeiragem, with, a, practitioner, being, known, as, a, capoeira, gradually, the, art, became, known, as, capoeira, with, a, practitioner, being, called, a, capoeirista, capoeira, first, appeared, among, africans, in, brazil, during, the, early, colonial, period, according, to, the, old, capoeira, mestres, and, tradition, within, the, community, capoeira, originates, from, angola, although, the, origin, of, capoeira, is, not, entirely, clear, many, studies, have, supported, the, oral, tradition, identifying, engolo, as, an, ancestral, art, and, locating, the, cunene, region, as, its, birthplace, still, some, authors, believe, there, were, more, ancestors, besides, engolo, however, at, the, core, of, capoeira, we, find, techniques, developed, in, engolo, including, crescent, kicks, push, kicks, sweeps, handstands, cartwheels, evasions, and, even, the, iconic, meia, lua, de, compasso, scorpion, kick, and, l, kick, the, street, capoeira, in, 19th, century, rio, was, very, violent, and, far, from, the, original, art, this, street, fighting, capoeiragem, was, mix, of, five, fighting, techniques, foot, kicks, head, butts, hand, blows, knife, fight, and, stick, fighting, only, the, first, of, them, arguably, originates, from, angolan, art, that, now, extinct, version, of, capoeira, was, called, capoeira, carioca, meaning, of, rio, de, janeiro, modern, capoeira, comes, from, bahia, and, was, codified, by, mestre, bimba, and, mestre, pastinha, in, regional, and, angola, style, despite, their, significant, differences, both, mestres, introduced, major, innovations, they, moved, training, and, rodas, away, from, the, street, instituted, the, academia, prescribed, uniforms, started, to, teach, women, and, presented, capoeira, to, a, broader, audiences, capoeira, is, a, fast, and, versatile, martial, art, that, is, historically, focused, on, fighting, when, outnumbered, or, at, a, technological, disadvantage, the, style, emphasizes, using, the, lower, body, to, kick, sweep, and, take, down, their, aggressors, using, the, upper, body, to, assist, those, movements, and, occasionally, attack, as, well, it, features, a, series, of, complex, positions, and, body, postures, that, are, meant, to, get, chained, in, an, uninterrupted, flow, to, strike, dodge, and, move, without, breaking, motion, conferring, the, style, with, a, characteristic, unpredictability, and, versatility, the, ginga, literally, rocking, back, and, forth, to, swing, is, the, fundamental, movement, in, capoeira, important, both, for, attack, and, defense, purposes, it, has, two, main, objectives, one, is, to, keep, the, capoeirista, in, a, state, of, constant, motion, preventing, them, from, being, a, still, and, easy, target, the, other, using, also, fakes, and, feints, is, to, mislead, fool, or, trick, the, opponent, leaving, them, open, for, an, attack, or, a, counter, attack, the, attacks, in, the, capoeira, should, be, done, when, opportunity, arises, and, though, they, can, be, preceded, by, feints, or, pokes, they, must, be, precise, and, decisive, like, a, direct, kick, to, the, head, face, or, a, vital, body, part, or, a, strong, takedown, most, capoeira, attacks, are, made, with, the, legs, like, direct, or, swirling, kicks, rasteiras, leg, sweeps, tesouras, or, knee, strikes, elbow, strikes, punches, and, other, forms, of, takedowns, complete, the, main, list, the, head, strike, is, a, very, important, counter, attack, move, the, defense, is, based, on, the, principle, of, non, resistance, meaning, avoiding, an, attack, using, evasive, moves, instead, of, blocking, it, avoids, are, called, esquivas, which, depend, on, the, direction, of, the, attack, and, intention, of, the, defender, and, can, be, done, standing, or, with, a, hand, leaning, on, the, floor, a, block, should, only, be, made, when, the, esquiva, is, completely, non, viable, this, fighting, strategy, allows, quick, and, unpredictable, counterattacks, the, ability, to, focus, on, more, than, one, adversary, and, to, face, empty, handed, an, armed, adversary, a, series, of, rolls, and, acrobatics, like, the, cartwheels, called, a, or, the, transitional, position, called, negativa, allows, the, capoeirista, to, quickly, overcome, a, takedown, or, a, loss, of, balance, and, to, position, themselves, around, the, aggressor, to, lay, up, for, an, attack, it, is, this, combination, of, attacks, defense, and, mobility, that, gives, capoeira, its, perceived, fluidity, and, choreography, like, style, through, most, of, its, history, in, brazil, capoeira, commonly, featured, weapons, and, weapon, training, given, its, street, fighting, nature, capoeiristas, usually, carried, knives, and, bladed, weapons, with, them, and, the, berimbau, could, be, used, to, conceal, those, inside, or, even, to, turn, itself, into, a, weapon, by, attaching, a, blade, to, its, tip, the, knife, or, razor, was, used, in, street, rodas, and, or, against, openly, hostile, opponents, and, would, be, drawn, quickly, to, stab, or, slash, other, hiding, places, for, the, weapons, included, hats, and, umbrellas, mestre, bimba, included, in, his, teachings, a, curso, de, especializa, o, or, specialization, course, in, which, the, pupils, would, be, taught, defenses, against, knives, and, guns, as, well, as, the, usage, of, knife, straight, razor, scythe, club, chanfolo, double, edged, dagger, fac, o, fac, n, or, machete, and, tira, teima, cane, sword, upon, graduating, pupils, were, given, a, red, scarf, which, marked, their, specialty, this, course, was, scarcely, used, and, was, ceased, after, some, time, a, more, common, custom, practised, by, bimba, and, his, students, however, was, furtively, handing, a, weapon, to, a, player, before, a, jogo, for, them, to, use, it, to, attack, their, opponent, on, bimba, s, sign, with, the, other, player, s, duty, being, to, disarm, them, this, weapon, training, is, almost, completely, absent, in, current, capoeira, teachings, but, some, groups, still, practice, the, use, of, razors, for, ceremonial, usage, in, the, rodas, in, bantu, culture, the, nkhumbi, term, ochimama, encapsulates, the, overlapping, meanings, of, game, dance, and, tradition, this, overlap, is, also, found, in, afro, brazilian, folklore, where, many, similar, forms, of, expression, are, called, brincadeiras, games, some, scholars, have, interpreted, capoeira, as, a, way, of, concealing, martial, arts, within, dance, movements, however, research, from, angola, suggests, that, the, relationship, between, game, fight, and, dance, may, be, even, deeper, these, scholars, propose, that, the, ambivalence, between, these, three, elements, is, a, fundamental, aspect, of, the, ancestral, grammar, shared, by, engolo, and, capoeira, playing, capoeira, is, both, a, game, and, a, method, of, practicing, the, application, of, capoeira, movements, in, simulated, combat, it, can, be, played, anywhere, but, it, s, usually, done, in, a, roda, during, the, game, most, capoeira, moves, are, used, but, capoeiristas, usually, avoid, punches, or, elbow, strikes, unless, it, s, a, very, aggressive, game, the, game, does, not, focus, on, knocking, down, or, defeating, opponents, but, rather, on, body, dialogue, and, highlighting, skills, the, roda, pronounced, is, a, circle, formed, by, capoeiristas, and, capoeira, musical, instruments, where, every, participant, sings, the, typical, songs, and, claps, their, hands, following, the, music, two, capoeiristas, enter, the, roda, and, play, the, game, according, to, the, style, required, by, the, musical, rhythm, the, game, finishes, when, one, of, the, musicians, holding, a, berimbau, determines, it, when, one, of, the, capoeiristas, decides, to, leave, or, call, the, end, of, the, game, or, when, another, capoeirista, interrupts, the, game, to, start, playing, either, with, one, of, the, current, players, or, with, another, capoeirista, in, a, roda, every, cultural, aspect, of, capoeira, is, present, not, only, the, martial, side, aerial, acrobatics, are, common, in, a, presentation, roda, while, not, seen, as,

new, students, will, get, recognized, as, capoeiristas, and, earn, their, first, graduation, also, more, experienced, students, may, go, up, in, rank, depending, on, their, skills, and, capoeira, culture, in, mestre, bimba, s, capoeira, regional, batizado, was, the, first, time, a, new, student, would, play, capoeira, following, the, sound, of, the, berimbau, students, enter, the, roda, against, a, high, ranked, capoeirista, such, as, a, teacher, or, master, and, normally, the, game, ends, with, the, student, being, taken, down, in, some, cases, the, more, experienced, capoeirista, can, judge, the, takedown, unnecessary, following, the, batizado, the, new, graduation, generally, in, the, form, of, a, cord, is, given, traditionally, the, batizado, is, the, moment, when, the, new, practitioner, gets, or, formalizes, their, apelido, nickname, this, tradition, was, created, back, when, capoeira, practice, was, considered, a, crime, to, avoid, having, problems, with, the, law, capoeiristas, would, present, themselves, in, the, capoeira, community, only, by, their, nicknames, chamada, means, call, and, can, happen, at, any, time, during, a, roda, where, the, rhythm, angola, is, being, played, it, happens, when, one, player, usually, the, more, advanced, one, calls, their, opponent, to, a, dance, like, ritual, the, opponent, then, approaches, the, caller, and, meets, them, to, walk, side, by, side, after, it, both, resume, normal, play, while, it, may, seem, like, a, break, time, or, a, dance, the, chamada, is, actually, both, a, trap, and, a, test, as, the, caller, is, just, watching, to, see, if, the, opponent, will, let, his, guard, down, so, she, can, perform, a, takedown, or, a, strike, it, is, a, critical, situation, because, both, players, are, vulnerable, due, to, the, close, proximity, and, potential, for, a, surprise, attack, it, s, also, a, tool, for, experienced, practitioners, and, masters, of, the, art, to, test, a, student, s, awareness, and, demonstrate, when, the, student, left, herself, open, to, attack, the, use, of, the, chamada, can, result, in, a, highly, developed, sense, of, awareness, and, helps, practitioners, learn, the, subtleties, of, anticipating, another, person, s, hidden, intentions, the, chamada, can, be, very, simple, consisting, solely, of, the, basic, elements, or, the, ritual, can, be, quite,

communication, with, the, ancestors, is, music, musical, instruments, play, a, pivotal, role, in, bridging, the, realms, of, the, living, the, deceased, and, the, gods, this, explains, why, african, dances, customarily, commence, by, paying, homage, to, the, primary, instrument, often, through, kneeling, or, bowing, before, it, this, practice, of, appeasement, and, seeking, divine, assistance, from, the, gods, is, mirrored, in, the, capoeira, tradition, of, kneeling, before, the, berimbau, during, the, ladainha, african, martial, arts, naturally, take, the, form, of, dance, in, bantu,

amulets, and, performed, specific, rituals, to, ensure, their, safety, same, players, do, their, mandinga, before, the, game, by, drawing, magical, symbols, on, the, ground, with, their, fingers,

that, you, learned, from, your, teacher, who, many, times, presents, himself, as, owner, of, the, truth, but, this, can, be, done, after, one, has, experience, and, an, idea, of, what, capoeira, is, maybe, after, ten, or, fifteen, years, of, practice, determining, styles, in, capoeira, is, difficult, since, there, was, never, a, unity, in, the, original, capoeira, or, a, teaching, method, before,

however, it, can, refer, to, two, things, the, ideal, of, capoeira, angola, is, to, maintain, capoeira, as, close, to, its, roots, as, possible, although, pastinha, strove, to, preserve, the, original, angolan, art, he, nevertheless, introduced, significant, changes, to, capoeira, practice, of, his, time, he, forbid, weapon, and, violent, moves, prescribed, uniforms, moved, training, away,

players, movements, a, low, game, the, absence, of, violence, beautiful, movements, according, to, a, black, aesthetic, slow, music, and, the, importance, of, ritual, and, theatricality, unlike, many, other, capoeira, groups, that, play, barefoot, angoleiros, always, train, with, shoes, when, it, comes, to, the, color, of, the, uniforms, there, is, a, lack, of, uniformity, within, the, style, although, mestre, pastinha, at, his, academy, required, students, to, wear, yellow, and, black, jerseys, some, of, his, successors, have, adopted, white, only, uniforms, within, their, schools, capoeira, regional, began, to, take, form, in, the, 1920s, when, mestre, bimba, met, his, future, student, jos, cisnando, lima, both, believed, that, capoeira, was, losing, its, martial, side, and, concluded, there, was, a, need, to, re, strengthen, and, structure, it, bimba, created, his, sequ, ncias, de, ensino, teaching, combinations, and, created, capoeira, s, first, teaching, method, advised, by, cisnando, bimba, decided, to, call, his, style, luta, regional, baiana, as, capoeira, was, still, illegal, at, that, time, the, base, of, capoeira, regional, is, the, original, capoeira, without, many, of, the, aspects, that, were, impractical, in, a, real, fight, with, less, subterfuge, and, more, objectivity, training, focuses, mainly, on, attack, dodging, and, counter, attack, giving, high, importance, to, precision, and, discipline, bimba, also, added, a, few, moves, from, other, arts, notably, the, batuque, an, old, street, fight, game, invented, by, his, father, use, of, jumps, or, aerial, acrobatics, stay, to, a, minimum, since, one, of, its, foundations, is, always, keeping, at, least, one, hand, or, foot, firmly, attached, to, the, ground, capoeira, regional, also,

to, emerge, in, s, o, paulo, during, the, 1960s, this, evolving, style, which, emerged, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, drew, from, both, regional, and, angola, styles, while, maintaining, its, distinct, characteristics, the, majority, of, modern, practitioners, affirm, to, be, neither, angola, nor, regional, emphasizing, that, there, is, only, one, capoeira, this, new, capoeira, incorporated, not,
