mid, 20th, century, 1970s, and, 1980s, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and, 2020s, professional, wrestling, is, a, form, of, athletic, theater, that, combines, mock, combat, with, drama, under, the, premise, that, the, performers, are, competitive, wrestlers, although, it, entails, elements, of, sports, wrestling, and, martial, arts, including, genuine, displays, of, athleticism, and, physicality, before, a, live, audience, professional, wrestling, is, distinguished, by, its, scripted, outcomes, and, emphasis, on, entertainment, and, showmanship, the, staged, nature, of, matches, is, an, open, secret, but, the, wrestlers, and, fans, alike, like, to, pretend, that, they, are, bona, fide, competitions, this, is, a, tradition, known, as, kayfabe, professional, wrestlers, perform, as, characters, and, usually, maintain, a, gimmick, consisting, of, a, specific, persona, stage, name, and, other, distinguishing, traits, matches, are, the, primary, vehicle, for, advancing, storylines, which, typically, center, on, interpersonal, conflicts, or, feuds, between, heroic, faces, and, villainous, heels, a, wrestling, ring, akin, to, the, platform, used, in, boxing, serves, as, the, main, stage, additional, scenes, may, be, recorded, for, television, in, backstage, areas, of, the, venue, in, a, format, similar, to, reality, television, performers, generally, integrate, authentic, wrestling, techniques, and, fighting, styles, with, choreography, stunts, improvisation, and, dramatic, conventions, designed, to, maximize, entertainment, value, and, audience, engagement, professional, wrestling, as, a, performing, art, evolved, from, the, common, practice, of, match, fixing, among, american, wrestlers, in, the, 19th, century, some, wrestlers, fixed, their, matches, to, carry, out, gambling, related, scams, and, others, did, it, to, make, matches, shorter, more, entertaining, and, less, physically, taxing, as, the, public, gradually, became, aware, of, the, fakery, they, chose, to, play, along, rather, than, denounce, it, because, the, spectacle, was, more, entertaining, when, faked, the, wrestlers, responded, by, increasingly, adding, melodrama, gimmickry, and, outlandish, stuntwork, to, their, performances, to, further, enhance, the, spectacle, by, at, least, the, early, 20th, century, professional, wrestling, had, diverged, from, the, authentic, sport, to, theater, professional, wrestling, is, performed, around, the, world, through, various, promotions, which, are, roughly, analogous, to, production, companies, or, sports, leagues, promotions, vary, considerably, in, size, scope, and, creative, approach, ranging, from, local, shows, on, the, independent, circuit, to, internationally, broadcast, events, at, major, arenas, the, largest, and, most, influential, promotions, are, in, the, united, states, mexico, japan, and, northwest, europe, the, united, kingdom, germany, austria, and, france, which, have, each, developed, distinct, styles, traditions, and, subgenres, within, professional, wrestling, professional, wrestling, has, developed, its, own, culture, and, community, including, a, distinct, vernacular, it, has, achieved, mainstream, success, and, influence, within, popular, culture, with, many, terms, tropes, and, concepts, being, referenced, in, everyday, language, as, well, as, in, film, music, television, and, video, games, likewise, numerous, professional, wrestlers, have, become, national, or, international, icons, with, recognition, by, the, broader, public, in, the, united, states, authentic, sports, wrestling, is, generally, practiced, in, an, amateur, context, no, professional, league, for, competitive, wrestling, exists, due, to, a, lack, of, popularity, for, example, real, pro, wrestling, an, american, professional, freestyle, wrestling, league, dissolved, in, 2007, after, just, two, seasons, in, other, countries, such, as, iran, and, india, wrestling, enjoys, widespread, popularity, as, a, genuine, sport, and, the, phrase, professional, wrestling, therefore, has, a, more, literal, meaning, in, those, places, a, notable, example, is, india, s, pro, wrestling, league, in, numerous, american, states, professional, wrestling, is, legally, defined, as, a, non, sport, for, instance, new, york, defines, professional, wrestling, as, professional, wrestling, means, an, activity, in, which, participants, struggle, hand, in, hand, primarily, for, the, purpose, of, providing, entertainment, to, spectators, and, which, does, not, comprise, a, bona, fide, athletic, contest, or, competition, professional, wrestling, is, not, a, combative, sport, wrestling, constituting, bona, fide, athletic, contests, and, competitions, which, may, be, professional, or, amateur, combative, sport, shall, not, be, deemed, professional, wrestling, under, this, part, professional, wrestling, as, used, in, this, part, shall, not, depend, on, whether, the, individual, wrestlers, are, paid, or, have, been, paid, for, their, performance, in, a, professional, wrestling, exhibition, all, engagements, of, professional, wrestling, shall, be, referred, to, as, exhibitions, and, not, as, matches, in, the, industry, s, slang, a, fixed, match, is, referred, to, as, a, worked, match, derived, from, the, slang, word, for, manipulation, as, in, working, the, crowd, a, shoot, match, is, a, genuine, contest, where, both, wrestlers, fight, to, win, and, are, therefore, straight, shooters, which, comes, from, a, carny, term, for, a, shooting, gallery, gun, whose, sights, were, not, deliberately, misaligned, wrestling, in, the, united, states, blossomed, in, popularity, after, the, civil, war, with, catch, wrestling, eventually, becoming, the, most, popular, style, at, first, professional, wrestlers, were, genuine, competitive, fighters, but, they, struggled, to, draw, audiences, because, americans, did, not, find, real, wrestling, to, be, very, entertaining, so, the, wrestlers, quietly, began, faking, their, matches, so, that, they, could, give, their, audiences, a, satisfying, spectacle, fixing, matches, was, also, convenient, for, scheduling, a, real, shoot, match, could, sometimes, last, hours, whereas, a, fixed, worked, match, can, be, made, short, which, was, convenient, for, wrestlers, on, tour, who, needed, to, keep, appointments, or, share, venues, it, also, suited, wrestlers, who, were, aging, and, therefore, lacked, the, stamina, for, an, hours, long, fight, audiences, also, preferred, short, matches, worked, matches, also, carried, less, risk, of, injury, which, meant, shorter, recovery, altogether, worked, matches, proved, more, profitable, than, shoots, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, nearly, all, professional, wrestling, matches, were, worked, a, major, influence, on, professional, wrestling, was, carnival, culture, wrestlers, in, the, late, 19th, century, worked, in, carnival, shows, for, a, fee, a, visitor, could, challenge, the, wrestler, to, a, quick, match, if, the, challenger, defeated, the, champion, in, a, short, time, frame, usually, 15, minutes, he, won, a, prize, to, encourage, challenges, the, carnival, operators, staged, rigged, matches, in, which, an, accomplice, posing, as, a, visitor, challenged, the, champion, and, won, giving, the, audience, the, impression, that, the, champion, was, easy, to, beat, this, practice, taught, wrestlers, the, art, of, staging, rigged, matches, and, fostered, a, mentality, that, spectators, were, marks, to, be, duped, the, term, kayfabe, comes, from, carny, slang, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, most, professional, wrestling, matches, were, worked, and, some, journalists, exposed, the, practice, american, wrestlers, are, notorious, for, the, amount, of, faking, they, do, it, is, because, of, this, fact, that, suspicion, attaches, to, so, many, bouts, that, the, game, is, not, popular, here, nine, out, of, ten, bouts, it, has, been, said, are, pre, arranged, affairs, and, it, would, be, no, surprise, if, the, ratio, of, fixed, matches, to, honest, ones, was, really, so, high, the, wrestler, lou, thesz, recalled, that, between, 1915, and, 1920, a, series, of, expos, s, in, the, newspapers, about, the, integrity, of, professional, wrestling, alienated, a, lot, of, fans, sending, the, industry, into, a, tailspin, but, rather, than, perform, more, shoot, matches, professional, wrestlers, instead, committed, themselves, wholesale, to, fakery, several, reasons, explain, why, professional, wrestling, became, fake, whereas, boxing, endured, as, a, legitimate, sport, firstly, wrestling, was, more, entertaining, when, it, was, faked, whereas, fakery, did, not, make, boxing, any, more, entertaining, secondly, in, a, rigged, boxing, match, the, designated, loser, must, take, a, real, beating, for, his, defeat, to, be, convincing, but, wrestling, holds, can, be, faked, convincingly, without, inflicting, injury, this, meant, that, boxers, were, less, willing, to, take, dives, they, wanted, to, have, a, victory, for, all, the, pain, to, which, they, subjected, themselves, in, the, 1910s, promotional, cartels, for, professional, wrestling, emerged, in, the, east, coast, outside, its, traditional, heartland, in, the, midwest, these, promoters, sought, to, make, long, term, plans, with, their, wrestlers, and, to, ensure, their, more, charismatic, and, crowd, pleasing, wrestlers, received, championships, further, entrenching, the, desire, for, worked, matches, the, primary, rationale, for, shoot, matches, at, this, point, was, challenges, from, independent, wrestlers, but, a, cartelized, wrestler, if, challenged, could, credibly, use, his, contractual, obligations, to, his, promoter, as, an, excuse, to, refuse, the, challenge, promotions, would, sometimes, respond, to, challenges, with, policemen, powerful, wrestlers, who, lacked, the, charisma, to, become, stars, but, could, defeat, and, often, seriously, injure, any, challenger, in, a, shoot, match, as, the, industry, trend, continued, there, were, fewer, independent, wrestlers, to, make, such, challenges, in, the, first, place, double, crosses, where, a, wrestler, agreed, to, lose, a, match, but, nevertheless, fought, to, win, remained, a, problem, in, the, early, cartel, days, at, times, a, promoter, would, even, award, a, victorious, double, crosser, the, title, of, champion, to, preserve, the, facade, of, sport, but, promoters, punished, such, wrestlers, by, blacklisting, them, making, it, quite, challenging, to, find, work, double, crossers, could, also, be, sued, for, breach, of, contract, such, as, dick, shikat, in, 1936, in, the, trial, witnesses, testified, that, most, of, the, big, matches, and, all, of, the, championship, bouts, were, fixed, by, the, 1930s, with, the, exception, of, the, occasional, double, cross, or, business, dispute, shoot, matches, were, essentially, nonexistent, in, april, 1930, the, new, york, state, athletic, commission, decreed, that, all, professional, wrestling, matches, held, in, the, state, had, to, be, advertised, as, exhibitions, unless, certified, as, contests, by, the, commission, the, commission, did, on, very, rare, occasions, hand, out, such, authorizations, such, as, for, a, championship, match, between, jim, londos, and, jim, browning, in, june, 1934, this, decree, did, not, apply, to, amateur, wrestling, which, the, commission, had, no, authority, over, wrestling, fans, widely, suspected, that, professional, wrestling, was, fake, but, they, did, not, care, as, long, as, it, entertained, in, 1933, a, wrestling, promoter, named, jack, pfefer, started, talking, about, the, industry, s, inner, workings, to, the, new, york, daily, mirror, maintaining, no, pretense, that, wrestling, was, real, and, passing, on, planned, results, just, before, the, matches, took, place, while, fans, were, neither, surprised, nor, alienated, traditionalists, like, jack, curley, were, furious, and, most, promoters, tried, to, maintain, the, facade, of, kayfabe, as, best, they, could, not, the, least, interesting, of, all, the, minor, phenomena, produced, by, the, current, fashion, of, wrestling, is, the, universal, discussion, as, to, the, honesty, of, the, matches, and, certainly, the, most, interesting, phrase, of, this, discussion, is, the, unanimous, agreement, who, cares, if, they, re, fixed, or, not, the, show, is, good, newspapers, tended, to, shun, professional, wrestling, as, they, were, put, off, by, the, dishonesty, of, this, non, sport, that, pretended, to, be, a, sport, eventually, promoters, resorted, to, publishing, their, own, magazines, in, order, to, get, press, coverage, and, communicate, with, fans, the, first, professional, wrestling, magazine, was, wrestling, as, you, like, it, which, printed, its, first, issue, in, 1946, these, magazines, were, faithful, to, kayfabe, before, the, advent, of, television, professional, wrestling, s, fanbase, largely, consisted, of, children, the, elderly, blue, collar, workers, and, minorities, when, television, arose, in, the, 1940s, professional, wrestling, got, national, exposure, on, prime, time, television, and, gained, widespread, popularity, professional, wrestling, was, previously, considered, a, niche, interest, but, the, tv, networks, at, the, time, were, short, on, content, and, thus, were, willing, to, try, some, wrestling, shows, in, the, 1960s, however, the, networks, moved, on, to, more, mainstream, interests, such, as, baseball, and, professional, wrestling, was, dropped, the, core, audience, then, shrunk, back, to, a, profile, similar, to, that, of, the, 1930s, in, 1989, vince, mcmahon, was, looking, to, exempt, his, promotion, the, world, wrestling, federation, from, sports, licensing, fees, to, achieve, this, he, testified, before, the, new, jersey, state, athletic, control, board, that, professional, wrestling, is, not, a, real, sport, because, its, matches, have, predetermined, outcomes, shortly, thereafter, new, jersey, deregulated, professional, wrestling, the, wwf, then, rebranded, itself, as, a, sports, entertainment, company, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, the, style, of, wrestling, used, in, professional, wrestling, matches, was, catch, wrestling, promoters, wanted, their, matches, to, look, realistic, and, so, preferred, to, recruit, wrestlers, with, real, grappling, skills, in, the, 1920s, a, group, of, wrestlers, and, promoters, known, as, the, gold, dust, trio, introduced, moves, which, have, since, become, staples, of, the, mock, combat, of, professional, wrestling, such, as, body, slams, suplexes, punches, finishing, moves, and, out, of, ring, count, outs, by, the, early, 1930s, most, wrestlers, had, adopted, personas, to, generate, public, interest, these, personas, could, broadly, be, characterized, as, either, faces, likeable, or, heels, villainous, native, americans, cowboys, and, english, aristocrats, were, staple, characters, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, before, the, age, of, television, some, wrestlers, played, different, personas, depending, on, the, region, they, were, performing, in, this, eventually, came, to, an, end, in, the, age, of, national, television, wrestling, shows, which, forced, wrestlers, to, stick, to, one, persona, wrestlers, also, often, used, some, sort, of, gimmick, such, as, a, finishing, move, eccentric, mannerisms, or, out, of, control, behavior, in, the, case, of, heels, the, matches, could, also, be, gimmicky, sometimes, with, wrestlers, fighting, in, mud, and, piles, of, tomatoes, and, so, forth, the, most, successful, and, enduring, gimmick, to, emerge, from, the, 1930s, were, tag, team, matches, promoters, noticed, that, matches, slowed, down, as, the, wrestlers, in, the, ring, tired, so, they, gave, them, partners, to, relieve, them, it, also, gave, heels, another, way, to, misbehave, by, double, teaming, towards, the, end, of, the, 1930s, faced, with, declining, revenues, promoters, chose, to, focus, on, grooming, charismatic, wrestlers, with, no, regard, for, their, skill, because, it, was, charisma, that, drew, the, crowds, and, wrestlers, who, were, both, skilled, at, grappling, and, charismatic, were, hard, to, come, by, since, most, of, the, public, by, this, time, knew, and, accepted, that, professional, wrestling, was, fake, realism, was, no, longer, paramount, and, a, background, in, authentic, wrestling, no, longer, mattered, after, this, time, matches, became, more, outlandish, and, gimmicky, and, any, semblance, professional, wrestling, had, to, catch, wrestling, faded, the, personas, of, the, wrestlers, likewise, grew, more, outlandish, gorgeous, george, who, performed, throughout, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, was, the, first, wrestler, whose, entrance, into, the, arena, was, accompanied, by, a, theme, song, played, over, the, arena, s, loudspeakers, his, being, pomp, and, circumstance, he, also, wore, a, costume, a, robe, and, hairnet, which, he, removed, after, getting, in, the, ring, he, also, had, a, pre, match, ritual, where, his, butler, would, spray, the, ring, with, perfume, in, the, 1980s, vince, mcmahon, made, entrance, songs, costumes, and, rituals, standard, for, his, star, wrestlers, for, instance, mcmahon, s, top, star, hulk, hogan, would, delight, the, audience, by, tearing, his, shirt, off, before, each, match, the, first, major, promoter, cartel, emerged, on, the, east, coast, although, up, to, that, point, wrestling, s, heartland, had, been, in, the, midwest, notable, members, of, this, cartel, included, jack, curley, lou, daro, paul, bowser, and, tom, and, tony, packs, the, promoters, colluded, to, solve, a, number, of, problems, that, hurt, their, profits, firstly, they, could, force, their, wrestlers, to, perform, for, less, money, as, the, cartel, grew, there, were, fewer, independent, promoters, where, independent, wrestlers, could, find, work, and, many, were, forced, to, sign, a, contract, with, the, cartel, to, receive, steady, work, the, contracts, forbade, them, from, performing, at, independent, venues, a, wrestler, who, refused, to, play, by, the, cartel, s, rules, was, barred, from, performing, at, its, venues, a, second, goal, of, the, wrestling, cartels, was, to, establish, an, authority, to, decide, who, was, the, world, champion, before, the, cartels, there, were, multiple, wrestlers, in, the, u, s, simultaneously, calling, themselves, the, world, champion, and, this, sapped, public, enthusiasm, for, professional, wrestling, likewise, the, cartel, could, agree, on, a, common, set, of, match, rules, that, the, fans, could, keep, track, of, the, issue, over, who, got, to, be, the, champion, and, who, controlled, said, champion, was, a, major, point, of, contention, among, the, members, of, wrestling, cartels, as, the, champion, drew, big, crowds, wherever, he, performed, and, this, would, occasionally, lead, to, schisms, by, 1925, this, cartel, had, divided, the, country, up, into, territories, which, were, the, exclusive, domains, of, specific, promoters, this, system, of, territories, endured, until, vince, mcmahon, drove, the, fragmented, cartels, out, of, the, market, in, the, 1980s, this, cartel, fractured, in, 1929, after, one, of, its, members, paul, bowser, bribed, ed, strangler, lewis, to, lose, his, championship, in, a, match, against, gus, sonnenberg, in, january, 1929, bowser, then, broke, away, from, the, trust, to, form, his, own, cartel, the, american, wrestling, association, awa, in, september, 1930, and, he, declared, sonnenberg, to, be, the, awa, champion, this, awa, should, not, be, confused, with, wally, kadbo, s, awa, founded, in, 1960, curley, reacted, to, this, move, by, convincing, the, national, boxing, association, to, form, the, national, wrestling, association, which, in, turn, crowned, a, champion, that, curley, put, forth, dick, shikat, the, national, wrestling, association, shut, down, in, 1980, in, 1948, a, number, of, promoters, from, across, the, country, came, together, to, form, the, national, wrestling, alliance, nwa, the, nwa, recognized, one, world, champion, voted, on, by, its, members, but, allowed, member, promoters, to, crown, their, own, local, champions, in, their, territories, if, a, member, poached, wrestlers, from, another, member, or, held, matches, in, another, member, s, territory, they, risked, being, ejected, from, the, nwa, at, which, point, his, territory, became, fair, game, for, everyone, the, nwa, would, blacklist, wrestlers, who, worked, for, independent, promoters, or, who, publicly, criticized, an, nwa, promoter, or, who, did, not, throw, a, match, on, command, if, an, independent, promoter, tried, to, establish, himself, in, a, certain, area, the, nwa, would, send, their, star, performers, to, perform, for, the, local, nwa, promoter, to, draw, the, customers, away, from, the, independent, by, 1956, the, nwa, controlled, 38, promotions, within, the, united, states, with, more, in, canada, mexico, australia, and, new, zealand, the, nwa, s, monopolistic, practices, became, so, stifling, that, the, independents, appealed, to, the, government, for, help, in, october, 1956, the, us, attorney, general, s, office, filed, an, antitrust, lawsuit, against, the, nwa, in, an, iowa, federal, district, court, the, nwa, settled, with, the, government, they, pledged, to, stop, allocating, exclusive, territories, to, its, promoters, to, stop, blacklisting, wrestlers, who, worked, for, outsider, promoters, and, to, admit, any, promoter, into, the, alliance, the, nwa, would, flout, many, of, these, promises, but, its, power, was, nonetheless, weakened, by, the, lawsuit, paul, bowser, s, awa, joined, the, nwa, in, 1949, the, awa, withdrew, from, the, alliance, in, 1957, and, renamed, itself, the, atlantic, athletic, corporation, aac, the, aac, shut, down, in, 1960, in, 1958, omaha, promoter, and, nwa, member, joe, dusek, recognized, verne, gagne, as, the, world, champion, without, the, approval, of, the, nwa, gagne, asked, for, a, match, against, the, recognized, nwa, champion, pat, o, connor, the, nwa, refused, to, honor, the, request, so, gagne, and, minneapolis, promoter, wally, karbo, established, the, american, wrestling, association, in, 1960, this, awa, should, not, be, confused, with, paul, bowser, s, awa, which, ceased, operations, just, two, months, prior, gagne, s, awa, operated, out, of, minnesota, unlike, the, nwa, which, only, allowed, faces, to, be, champions, gagne, occasionally, allowed, heels, to, win, the, awa, championship, so, that, they, could, serve, as, foils, for, him, in, august, 1983, the, world, wrestling, federation, wwf, a, promotion, in, the, north, east, withdrew, from, the, nwa, vince, k, mcmahon, then, took, over, as, its, boss, no, longer, bound, by, the, territorial, pact, of, the, nwa, mcmahon, began, expanding, his, promotion, into, the, territories, of, his, former, nwa, peers, now, his, rivals, by, the, end, of, the, 1980s, the, wwf, would, become, the, sole, national, wrestling, promotion, in, the, u, s, this, was, in, part, made, possible, by, the, rapid, spread, of, cable, television, in, the, 1980s, the, national, broadcast, networks, generally, regarded, professional, wrestling, as, too, niche, an, interest, and, had, not, broadcast, any, national, wrestling, shows, since, the, 1950s, before, cable, tv, a, typical, american, household, only, received, four, national, channels, by, antenna, and, ten, to, twelve, local, channels, via, uhf, broadcasting, but, cable, television, could, carry, a, much, larger, selection, of, channels, and, therefore, had, room, for, niche, interests, the, wwf, started, with, a, show, called, all, american, wrestling, airing, on, the, usa, network, in, september, 1983, mcmahon, s, tv, shows, made, his, wrestlers, national, celebrities, so, when, he, held, matches, in, a, new, city, attendance, was, high, because, there, was, a, waiting, fanbase, cultivated, in, advance, by, the, cable, tv, shows, the, nwa, s, traditional, anti, competitive, tricks, were, no, match, for, this, the, nwa, attempted, to, centralize, and, create, their, own, national, cable, television, shows, to, counter, mcmahon, s, rogue, promotion, but, it, failed, in, part, because, the, members, of, the, nwa, ever, protective, of, their, territories, could, not, stomach, submitting, themselves, to, a, central, authority, nor, could, any, of, them, stomach, the, idea, of, leaving, the, nwa, themselves, to, compete, directly, with, mcmahon, for, that, would, mean, their, territories, would, become, fair, game, for, the, other, nwa, members, mcmahon, also, had, a, creative, flair, for, tv, that, his, rivals, lacked, for, instance, the, awa, s, tv, productions, during, the, 1980s, were, amateurish, low, budget, and, out, of, touch, with, contemporary, culture, which, lead, to, the, promotion, s, closing, in, 1991, in, the, spring, of, 1984, the, wwf, purchased, georgia, championship, wrestling, gcw, which, had, been, ailing, for, some, time, due, to, financial, mismanagement, and, internal, squabbles, in, the, deal, the, wwf, acquired, the, gcw, s, timeslot, on, tbs, mcmahon, agreed, to, keep, showing, georgia, wrestling, matches, in, that, timeslot, but, he, was, unable, to, get, his, staff, to, atlanta, every, saturday, to, fulfill, this, obligation, so, he, sold, gcw, and, its, tbs, timeslot, to, jim, crockett, promotions, jcp, jcp, started, informally, calling, itself, world, championship, wrestling, wcw, in, 1988, ted, turner, bought, jcp, and, formally, renamed, it, world, championship, wrestling, during, the, 1990s, wcw, became, a, credible, rival, to, the, wwf, but, by, end, it, suffered, from, a, series, of, creative, missteps, that, led, to, its, failure, and, purchase, by, the, wwf, one, of, its, mistakes, was, that, it, diminished, the, glamor, of, its, world, heavyweight, championship, between, january, 2000, and, march, 2001, the, title, changed, hands, eighteen, times, which, sapped, fan, enthusiasm, particularly, for, the, climactic, pay, per, view, matches, in, professional, wrestling, two, factors, decide, the, way, of, proceedings, the, in, show, happenings, presented, through, the, shows, and, real, life, happenings, outside, the, work, that, have, implications, such, as, performer, contracts, legitimate, injuries, etc, because, actual, life, events, are, often, co, opted, by, writers, for, incorporation, into, storylines, of, performers, the, lines, between, real, life, and, fictional, life, are, often, blurred, and, become, confused, special, discern, must, be, taken, with, people, who, perform, under, their, own, name, such, as, kurt, angle, and, his, fictional, persona, the, actions, of, the, character, in, shows, must, be, considered, fictional, wholly, separate, from, the, life, of, the, performer, this, is, similar, to, other, entertainers, who, perform, with, a, persona, that, shares, their, own, name, some, wrestlers, also, incorporate, elements, of, their, real, life, personalities, into, their, characters, even, if, they, and, their, in, ring, persona, have, different, names, kayfabe, is, the, practice, of, pretending, that, professional, wrestling, is, a, true, sport, wrestlers, would, at, all, times, flatly, deny, allegations, that, they, fixed, their, matches, and, they, often, remained, in, character, in, public, even, when, not, performing, when, in, public, wrestlers, would, sometimes, say, the, word, kayfabe, to, each, other, as, a, coded, signal, that, there, were, fans, present, and, they, needed, to, be, in, character, professional, wrestlers, in, the, past, strongly, believed, that, if, they, admitted, the, truth, their, audiences, would, desert, them, today, s, performers, don, t, protect, the, industry, like, we, did, but, that, s, primarily, because, they, ve, already, exposed, it, by, relying, on, silly, or, downright, ludicrous, characters, and, gimmicks, to, gain, popularity, with, the, fans, it, was, different, in, my, day, when, our, product, was, presented, as, an, authentic, competitive, sport, we, protected, it, because, we, believed, it, would, collapse, if, we, ever, so, much, as, implied, publicly, that, it, was, something, other, than, what, it, appeared, to, be, i, m, not, sure, now, the, fear, was, ever, justified, given, the, fact, that, the, industry, is, still, in, existence, today, but, the, point, is, no, one, questioned, the, need, then, protecting, the, business, in, the, face, of, criticism, and, skepticism, was, the, first, and, most, important, rule, a, pro, wrestler, learned, no, matter, how, aggressive, or, informed, the, questioner, you, never, admitted, the, industry, was, anything, but, a, competitive, sport, the, first, wrestling, promoter, to, publicly, admit, to, routinely, fixing, matches, was, jack, pfefer, in, 1933, he, started, talking, about, the, industry, s, inner, workings, to, the, new, york, daily, mirror, resulting, in, a, huge, expos, the, expos, neither, surprised, nor, alienated, most, wrestling, fans, although, some, promoters, like, jack, curley, were, furious, and, tried, to, restore, the, facade, of, kayfabe, as, best, as, they, could, in, 1989, vince, mcmahon, testified, before, the, new, jersey, government, that, professional, wrestling, was, not, a, true, sport, and, therefore, should, be, exempted, from, sports, related, taxes, many, wrestlers, and, fans, resented, mcmahon, for, this, but, lou, thesz, accepted, it, as, the, smart, move, as, it, gave, the, industry, more, freedom, to, do, as, it, pleased, and, because, by, that, point, professional, wrestling, no, longer, attempted, to, appear, real, the, demise, of, wcw, in, 2001, provided, some, evidence, that, kayfabe, still, mattered, to, a, degree, vince, russo, the, boss, of, wcw, in, 2000, completely, disregarded, kayfabe, by, routinely, discussing, business, matters, and, office, politics, in, public, which, alienated, fans, i, watch, championship, wrestling, from, florida, with, wrestling, commentator, gordon, solie, is, this, all, fake, if, so, they, deserve, an, oscar, professional, wrestling, shows, can, be, considered, a, form, of, theater, in, the, round, with, the, ring, ringside, area, and, entryway, comprising, a, stage, there, is, less, of, a, fourth, wall, than, in, most, theatric, performances, similar, to, pantomime, involving, audience, participation, the, audience, is, recognized, and, acknowledged, by, the, performers, as, spectators, to, the, sporting, event, being, portrayed, and, are, encouraged, to, interact, as, such, this, leads, to, a, high, level, of, audience, participation, in, fact, their, reactions, can, dictate, how, the, performance, unfolds, often, individual, matches, will, be, part, of, a, longer, story, line, conflict, between, babyfaces, often, shortened, to, just, faces, and, heels, faces, the, good, guys, are, those, whose, actions, are, intended, to, encourage, the, audience, to, cheer, while, heels, the, bad, guys, act, to, draw, the, spectators, ire, in, pro, wrestling, matches, performers, often, execute, a, series, of, pre, planned, moves, and, attacks, ranging, from, grappling, and, throws, found, in, some, traditional, forms, of, wrestling, to, more, spectacular, stunts, sometimes, involving, props, and, special, effects, the, attacks, in, these, matches, are, designed, to, appear, dramatic, while, reducing, the, risk, of, serious, injury, as, much, as, possible, overall, the, performers, aim, to, minimize, the, actual, injurious, impact, of, their, moves, while, maximizing, their, entertainment, value, shows, produced, by, the, largest, professional, wrestling, promotions, like, wwe, are, traditionally, performed, in, indoor, venues, flagship, events, in, this, profession, like, wrestlemania, are, sometimes, staged, at, outdoor, venues, these, shows, are, generally, video, recorded, for, live, or, delayed, broadcasting, for, an, audience, all, over, the, world, additionally, filmed, footage, known, as, segments, or, promos, are, usually, used, to, accompany, the, drama, in, these, shows, prior, experience, in, legitimate, wrestling, is, not, a, requirement, for, aspiring, professional, wrestlers, but, is, seen, as, an, advantageous, background, despite, its, scripted, format, there, have, been, quite, a, number, of, performers, throughout, the, history, of, pro, wrestling, who, have, had, prior, experience, in, legitimate, wrestling, before, transitioning, to, its, theatrical, form, a, popular, performer, kurt, angle, is, the, first, olympic, gold, medalist, in, professional, wrestling, history, having, won, his, gold, medal, at, the, 1996, summer, olympic, games, in, freestyle, wrestling, another, prominent, performer, is, brock, lesnar, a, former, ncaa, wrestler, who, won, the, ncaa, division, i, national, championship, in, 2000, professional, wrestlers, nominally, compete, under, rules, promulgated, by, wrestling, promotions, however, the, rules, are, not, legitimate, standards, for, sporting, activity, instead, serving, as, a, basis, to, advance, plotlines, similar, to, the, artificial, constraints, imposed, in, other, fictional, universes, sociologist, thomas, s, henricks, has, argued, the, rules, serve, as, a, basis, for, a, structuralist, moral, order, serving, to, advance, plot, lines, involving, charismatic, heroes, applying, an, instrumentally, rationalist, approach, to, social, conflicts, professional, wrestlers, do, not, follow, an, industry, standard, set, of, rules, unlike, most, sporting, events, which, generally, have, a, governing, body, to, regulate, competitions, while, each, promoter, can, set, his, own, standards, promoters, have, long, understood, that, fans, enjoy, professional, wrestling, more, when, all, matches, appear, to, follow, a, consistent, set, of, rules, the, rules, described, in, this, section, represent, common, standards, but, may, not, precisely, align, with, the, ruleset, of, any, specific, promotion, matches, are, staged, between, two, or, more, sides, corners, each, corner, may, consist, of, one, wrestler, or, a, team, of, two, or, more, most, team, matches, are, nominally, governed, by, tag, team, rules, other, matches, present, under, the, premise, of, a, free, for, alls, with, multiple, combatants, but, no, teams, in, all, variants, there, can, be, only, one, winning, team, or, wrestler, matches, generally, take, place, within, a, wrestling, ring, an, elevated, square, canvas, mat, with, posts, on, each, corner, a, cloth, apron, hangs, over, the, edges, of, the, ring, three, horizontal, ropes, or, cables, surround, the, ring, suspended, with, turnbuckles, which, are, connected, to, the, posts, for, safety, the, ropes, are, padded, at, the, turnbuckles, and, cushioned, mats, surround, the, floor, outside, the, ring, guardrails, or, a, similar, barrier, enclose, this, area, from, the, audience, wrestlers, are, generally, expected, to, stay, within, the, confines, of, the, ring, though, matches, sometimes, end, up, moving, outside, the, ring, and, even, into, the, audience, the, standard, method, of, scoring, is, the, fall, which, is, premised, as, being, accomplished, by, these, are, each, explained, in, greater, detail, below, pinfalls, and, submissions, must, occur, within, the, ring, unless, stipulated, otherwise, most, wrestling, matches, last, for, a, set, number, of, falls, with, the, first, side, to, achieve, the, majority, number, of, pinfalls, submissions, or, countouts, being, the, kayfabe, winner, historically, the, matches, went, to, 3, falls, best, 2, out, of, 3, or, 5, falls, best, 3, out, of, 5, for, modern, wrestling, the, genre, convention, is, 1, fall, these, matches, have, a, time, limit, if, not, enough, falls, are, scored, by, the, end, of, the, time, limit, the, match, is, presented, as, draw, modern, matches, are, generally, given, a, 10, to, 30, minute, time, limit, for, standard, matches, title, matches, can, go, for, up, to, one, hour, british, wrestling, matches, held, under, admiral, lord, mountevans, rules, and, similar, systems, across, europe, consist, of, a, series, of, rounds, typically, six, rounds, each, lasting, three, minutes, or, until, a, fall, or, submission, is, scored, with, a, thirty, second, break, between, each, round, and, can, either, be, two, out, of, three, falls, one, fall, to, a, finish, mostly, for, low, priority, warmup, matches, or, the, wrestler, with, the, most, falls, wins, at, the, end, of, the, final, round, an, alternative, subgenre, involves, is, a, match, set, for, a, prescribed, length, of, time, with, a, running, tally, of, falls, the, entrant, with, the, most, falls, at, the, end, of, the, time, limit, is, declared, the, winner, this, is, usually, for, 20, 30, or, 60, minutes, and, is, commonly, called, an, iron, man, match, this, type, of, match, can, be, modified, so, that, fewer, types, of, falls, are, allowed, in, performances, staged, with, multiple, competitors, an, elimination, system, may, be, used, any, wrestler, who, has, a, fall, scored, against, them, is, forced, out, of, the, match, and, the, match, continues, until, only, one, remains, it, is, much, more, common, when, more, than, two, wrestlers, are, involved, to, simply, go, one, fall, with, the, one, scoring, the, fall, regardless, of, who, they, scored, it, against, being, the, winner, in, championship, matches, this, means, that, unlike, one, on, one, matches, where, the, champion, can, simply, disqualify, himself, or, get, himself, counted, out, to, retain, the, title, via, the, champion, s, advantage, the, champion, does, not, have, to, be, pinned, or, involved, in, the, decision, to, lose, the, championship, heel, champions, often, find, advantages, not, in, champion, s, advantage, but, in, the, use, of, weapons, and, outside, interference, as, these, poly, sided, matches, tend, to, involve, no, holds, barred, rules, some, wrestling, performances, are, staged, with, unique, winning, conditions, often, to, allow, a, thing, theoristic, plot, construction, an, example, is, the, ladder, match, in, the, basic, ladder, match, the, premise, is, wrestlers, or, teams, of, wrestlers, must, climb, a, ladder, to, obtain, a, prize, that, is, hoist, above, the, ring, the, key, to, winning, this, match, is, that, the, wrestler, or, team, of, wrestlers, must, try, to, incapacitate, each, other, long, enough, for, one, wrestler, to, climb, the, ladder, and, secure, that, prize, for, their, team, as, a, result, the, ladder, can, be, used, as, a, weapon, the, prizes, include, but, are, not, limited, to, any, given, championship, belt, the, traditional, prize, a, document, granting, the, winner, the, right, to, a, future, title, shot, or, any, document, that, matters, to, the, wrestlers, involved, in, the, match, such, as, one, granting, the, winner, a, cash, prize, something, that, is, also, common, in, pro, wrestling, is, the, cage, match, which, comes, in, many, variety, and, is, often, used, as, the, final, battle, in, a, heated, rivalry, another, common, specialty, match, is, known, as, the, battle, royal, in, a, battle, royal, all, the, wrestlers, enter, the, ring, to, the, point, that, there, are, 20, 30, wrestlers, in, the, ring, at, one, time, when, the, match, begins, the, simple, objective, is, to, throw, the, opponent, over, the, top, rope, and, out, of, the, ring, with, both, feet, on, the, floor, to, eliminate, that, opponent, the, last, wrestler, standing, is, declared, the, winner, a, variant, on, this, type, of, match, is, the, wwe, s, royal, rumble, where, two, wrestlers, enter, the, ring, to, start, the, match, and, other, wrestlers, follow, in, 90, second, intervals, previously, 2, minutes, until, 30, 40, wrestlers, have, entered, the, ring, all, other, rules, stay, the, same, almost, every, professional, wrestling, match, features, referee, who, is, the, final, arbitrator, of, the, fictional, rules, which, may, vary, from, promotion, to, promotion, in, multi, man, lucha, libre, matches, two, referees, are, used, one, inside, the, ring, and, one, outside, due, to, the, legitimate, role, that, referees, play, in, wrestling, of, serving, as, liaison, between, the, bookers, backstage, and, the, wrestlers, in, the, ring, the, role, of, being, a, final, arbitrator, is, merely, kayfabe, the, referee, is, present, even, in, matches, that, do, not, at, first, glance, appear, to, require, a, referee, such, as, a, ladder, match, as, it, is, no, holds, barred, and, the, criteria, for, victory, could, theoretically, be, assessed, from, afar, although, their, actions, are, also, frequently, scripted, for, dramatic, effect, referees, are, subject, to, certain, general, rules, and, requirements, to, maintain, the, theatrical, appearance, of, unbiased, authority, the, most, basic, rule, is, that, an, action, must, be, seen, by, a, referee, to, be, declared, for, a, fall, or, disqualification, this, allows, for, heel, characters, to, gain, a, scripted, advantage, by, distracting, or, disabling, the, referee, to, perform, some, ostensibly, illegal, maneuver, on, their, opponent, most, referees, are, unnamed, and, essentially, anonymous, though, some, wrestling, promotions, most, notably, in, the, present, all, elite, wrestling, have, made, officials, known, by, their, names, and, there, are, some, cases, where, fans, have, called, their, names, during, matches, special, guest, referees, may, be, used, from, time, to, time, by, virtue, of, their, celebrity, status, they, are, often, scripted, to, dispense, with, the, appearance, of, neutrality, and, use, their, influence, to, unfairly, influence, the, outcome, of, the, match, for, added, dramatic, impact, face, special, referees, will, often, fight, back, against, hostile, heel, wrestlers, particularly, if, the, special, referee, is, either, a, wrestler, himself, or, a, famous, martial, artist, such, as, tito, ortiz, at, the, main, event, at, hard, justice, 2005, for, dramatic, effect, heel, referees, may, assist, a, heel, wrestler, several, common, plot, devices, involve, the, heel, referee, assisting, the, heel, wrestler, in, some, team, matches, there, is, a, fictional, premise, that, only, one, entrant, from, each, team, may, be, designated, as, the, legal, or, active, wrestler, at, any, given, moment, two, wrestlers, must, make, physical, contact, in, the, corner, typically, palm, to, palm, to, transfer, this, legal, status, this, is, known, as, a, tag, with, the, participants, tagging, out, and, tagging, in, typically, the, wrestler, who, is, tagging, out, has, a, five, count, to, leave, the, ring, whereas, the, one, tagging, in, can, enter, the, ring, at, any, time, resulting, in, heels, legally, double, teaming, a, face, the, non, legal, wrestlers, must, remain, outside, the, ring, or, other, legal, area, at, all, times, and, avoid, purposeful, contact, with, the, opposing, wrestlers, or, face, reprimand, from, the, referee, in, most, promotions, the, wrestler, to, be, tagged, in, must, be, touching, the, turnbuckle, on, his, corner, or, a, cloth, strap, attached, to, the, turnbuckle, some, multi, wrestler, matches, allow, for, a, set, number, of, legal, wrestlers, this, rule, is, commonplace, in, four, way, tag, team, matches, where, only, two, wrestlers, are, legal, in, the, match, meaning, two, teams, will, have, both, members, on, the, outside, at, any, given, time, in, these, matches, tags, can, be, made, between, any, two, teams, regardless, if, they, are, on, the, same, team, or, not, as, a, result, of, this, stipulation, tags, between, different, teams, are, not, usually, mutual, effort, a, non, legal, wrestler, will, usually, tag, themselves, in, against, the, legal, wrestler, s, will, a, legal, wrestler, will, only, voluntarily, tag, themselves, out, to, another, team, if, their, own, partner, is, incapacitated, or, are, being, held, in, a, submission, hold, and, are, closer, to, another, tag, team, than, their, own, sometimes, poly, sided, matches, that, pit, every, man, for, himself, will, incorporate, tagging, rules, outside, of, kayfabe, this, is, done, to, give, wrestlers, a, break, from, the, action, as, these, matches, tend, to, go, on, for, long, periods, of, time, and, to, make, the, action, in, the, ring, easier, to, choreograph, one, of, the, most, mainstream, examples, of, this, is, the, four, corner, match, the, most, common, type, of, match, in, the, wwe, before, it, was, replaced, with, its, equivalent, fatal, four, way, four, wrestlers, each, for, himself, fight, in, a, match, but, only, two, wrestlers, can, be, in, the, match, at, any, given, time, the, other, two, are, positioned, in, the, corner, and, tags, can, be, made, between, any, two, wrestlers, in, a, texas, tornado, tag, team, match, all, the, competitors, are, legal, in, the, match, and, tagging, in, and, out, is, not, necessary, all, matches, fought, under, hardcore, rules, such, as, no, disqualification, no, holds, barred, ladder, match, etc, are, all, contested, under, de, facto, texas, tornado, rules, since, the, lack, of, ability, of, a, referee, to, issue, a, disqualification, renders, any, tagging, requirements, moot, regardless, of, rules, of, tagging, a, wrestler, cannot, pin, his, or, her, own, tag, team, partner, even, if, it, is, technically, possible, from, the, rules, of, the, match, e, g, texas, tornado, rules, or, a, three, way, tag, team, match, this, is, called, the, outlaw, rule, because, the, first, team, to, attempt, to, use, that, in, an, attempt, to, unfairly, retain, their, tag, team, titles, was, the, new, age, outlaws, although, scripted, and, choreographed, wrestling, matches, are, presented, as, being, legitimate, athletic, competitions, decided, on, one, of, several, possible, outcomes, a, matches, fictional, premise, may, allow, a, score, by, pinfall, in, which, a, wrestling, performer, must, pin, both, his, opponent, s, shoulders, against, the, mat, while, the, referee, slaps, the, mat, three, times, referred, to, as, a, three, count, this, is, the, most, common, form, presented, a, defeat, the, pinned, wrestler, must, also, be, on, his, back, and, if, they, re, lying, on, his, stomach, it, usually, does, not, count, a, count, may, be, started, at, any, time, that, a, wrestler, s, shoulders, are, down, both, shoulders, touching, the, mat, back, first, and, any, part, of, the, opponent, s, body, is, lying, over, the, wrestler, this, often, results, in, pins, that, can, easily, be, kicked, out, of, if, the, defensive, wrestler, is, even, slightly, conscious, for, example, an, attacking, wrestler, who, is, half, conscious, may, simply, drape, an, arm, over, an, opponent, or, a, cocky, wrestler, may, place, his, foot, gently, on, the, opponent, s, body, prompting, a, three, count, from, the, referee, in, some, promotions, there, is, a, premise, that, certain, pinning, methods, are, disallowed, including, using, the, ropes, for, leverage, and, hooking, the, opponent, s, clothing, as, a, plot, device, disallowed, pinning, methods, can, be, depicted, as, a, cheating, method, for, heels, pins, such, as, these, are, rarely, seen, by, the, referee, and, are, often, used, by, heels, and, on, occasion, by, cheating, faces, to, win, matches, even, if, it, is, noticed, storylines, rarely, result, in, a, disqualification, and, instead, it, simply, results, in, nullification, of, the, pin, attempt, so, the, wrestler, rarely, has, anything, to, lose, occasionally, there, are, instances, where, a, pinfall, is, presented, as, being, made, where, both, wrestlers, shoulders, were, on, the, mat, for, the, three, count, this, situation, will, most, likely, lead, to, a, draw, and, in, some, cases, a, continuation, of, the, match, or, a, future, match, to, determine, the, winner, to, score, by, submission, the, performer, must, make, their, opponent, give, up, usually, by, putting, them, in, a, submission, hold, e, g, figure, four, leg, lock, arm, lock, sleeper, hold, a, performer, may, appear, to, voluntarily, submit, by, verbally, informing, the, referee, usually, used, in, moves, such, as, the, mexican, surfboard, where, all, four, limbs, are, incapacitated, making, tapping, impossible, since, ken, shamrock, popularized, it, in, 1997, a, wrestler, can, indicate, a, voluntary, submission, by, tapping, out, that, is, tapping, a, free, hand, against, the, mat, or, against, an, opponent, submission, was, initially, a, large, factor, in, professional, wrestling, but, following, the, decline, of, the, submission, oriented, catch, as, catch, can, style, from, mainstream, professional, wrestling, the, submission, largely, faded, despite, this, some, wrestlers, such, as, chris, jericho, ric, flair, bret, hart, kurt, angle, ken, shamrock, dean, malenko, chris, benoit, bryan, danielson, and, tazz, became, famous, for, their, fictional, depictions, of, winning, matches, via, submission, a, wrestler, with, a, signature, submission, technique, is, portrayed, as, better, at, applying, the, hold, making, it, more, painful, or, more, difficult, to, get, out, of, than, others, or, can, be, falsely, credited, as, inventing, the, hold, such, as, when, tazz, popularized, the, kata, ha, jime, judo, choke, in, pro, wrestling, as, the, tazzmission, under, wrestling, nominal, rules, all, contact, between, the, wrestlers, must, cease, if, any, part, of, the, body, is, touching, or, underneath, the, ropes, as, such, many, performances, will, attempt, to, break, submission, holds, by, deliberately, grabbing, the, bottom, ropes, this, is, called, a, rope, break, and, it, is, one, of, the, most, common, ways, to, break, a, submission, hold, most, holds, leave, an, arm, or, leg, free, so, that, the, person, can, tap, out, if, they, want, instead, they, use, these, free, limbs, to, either, grab, one, of, the, ring, ropes, or, drape, their, foot, across, or, underneath, one, once, this, has, been, accomplished, and, witnessed, by, the, referee, the, referee, will, demand, that, the, offending, wrestler, break, the, hold, and, start, counting, to, five, if, the, wrestler, does, not, if, the, referee, reaches, the, count, of, five, and, the, wrestler, still, does, not, break, the, hold, they, are, disqualified, if, a, manager, decides, that, their, wrestler, presented, as, their, client, should, tap, out, but, cannot, convince, the, wrestler, to, do, so, they, may, throw, in, the, towel, by, literally, taking, a, gym, towel, and, hurling, it, into, the, ring, where, the, referee, can, see, it, this, is, the, same, as, a, submission, as, in, kayfabe, the, manager, is, considered, the, wrestler, s, agent, and, therefore, authorized, to, make, formal, decisions, such, as, forfeiting, a, match, on, the, client, s, behalf, some, wrestling, performances, are, presented, as, resulting, in, a, knockout, mirroring, legitimate, martial, arts, and, concluding, with, a, technical, knockout, or, technical, submission, to, determine, if, a, wrestler, has, passed, out, in, wwe, the, referee, usually, picks, up, and, drops, his, hand, if, it, drops, to, the, mat, or, floor, one, or, three, consecutive, times, without, the, wrestler, having, the, strength, to, hold, it, up, the, wrestler, is, considered, to, have, passed, out, a, performer, can, also, be, presented, as, winning, by, technical, knockout, even, if, he, does, not, resort, to, submission, holds, but, still, beats, the, opponent, to, the, point, of, unconsciousness, or, to, the, impossibility, to, defend, himself, to, check, for, a, technical, knockout, in, this, manner, a, referee, would, wave, his, hand, in, front, of, the, wrestler, s, face, and, if, this, produces, no, reaction, of, any, kind, the, referee, would, award, the, victory, to, the, other, wrestler, a, wrestler, can, also, request, a, ten, count, from, the, referee, when, under, the, event, s, fictional, premise, they, think, an, opponent, is, sufficiently, incapacitated, to, not, be, able, to, stand, before, the, count, of, ten, except, in, traditional, european, promotions, where, following, down, on, a, fallen, opponent, was, prohibited, these, knockouts, are, rarely, used, or, mentioned, as, logically, it, makes, more, sense, for, a, wrestler, to, actively, pin, an, opponent, for, three, seconds, rather, than, leaving, an, opponent, the, chance, to, stand, up, before, ten, in, such, european, promotions, countouts, as, described, below, are, treated, as, a, variant, of, a, knockout, a, performance, can, be, depicted, as, ending, in, a, countout, alternatively, count, out, or, count, out, where, wrestler, is, out, of, the, ring, long, enough, for, the, referee, to, count, to, ten, twenty, in, some, promotions, and, thus, under, the, event, s, fictional, premise, is, disqualified, the, count, is, broken, and, restarted, when, a, wrestler, in, the, ring, exits, the, ring, playing, into, this, some, wrestlers, are, depicted, as, milking, the, count, by, sliding, in, the, ring, and, immediately, sliding, back, out, as, he, was, technically, inside, the, ring, for, a, split, second, before, exiting, again, it, is, sufficient, to, restart, the, count, this, is, often, referred, to, by, commentators, as, breaking, the, count, heels, often, use, this, tactic, in, order, to, buy, themselves, more, time, to, catch, their, breath, or, to, attempt, to, frustrate, their, babyface, opponents, if, all, the, active, wrestlers, in, a, match, are, down, inside, the, ring, at, the, same, time, the, referee, begins, a, count, usually, ten, seconds, twenty, in, japan, if, nobody, rises, to, their, feet, by, the, end, of, the, count, the, match, is, ruled, a, draw, any, participant, who, stands, up, in, time, ends, the, count, for, everyone, else, while, in, a, last, man, standing, match, this, form, of, a, countout, is, the, only, way, that, the, match, can, end, so, the, referee, counts, when, one, or, more, wrestlers, are, down, and, one, wrestler, standing, up, before, the, 10, count, does, not, stop, the, count, for, another, wrestler, who, is, still, down, in, most, major, modern, promotions, championships, are, not, permitted, to, change, hands, via, a, countout, unless, the, on, screen, authority, figure, declares, otherwise, this, rule, varies, in, some, promotions, however, in, some, storylines, heels, are, presented, take, advantage, of, this, and, will, intentionally, get, counted, out, when, facing, difficult, opponents, while, defending, championships, disqualification, sometimes, abbreviated, as, dq, occurs, when, a, wrestler, violates, the, rules, established, as, part, of, the, performance, s, fictional, premise, thus, losing, automatically, although, a, countout, can, technically, be, considered, a, disqualification, as, it, is, for, all, intents, and, purposes, an, automatic, loss, suffered, as, a, result, of, violating, a, match, rule, the, two, concepts, are, often, distinct, in, wrestling, a, no, disqualification, match, can, still, end, by, countout, although, this, is, rare, typically, a, match, must, be, declared, a, no, holds, barred, match, a, street, fight, or, some, other, term, in, order, for, both, disqualifications, and, countouts, to, be, waived, disqualification, from, a, match, is, called, when, the, fictional, storyline, involves, in, the, fictional, universe, of, some, promotions, not, all, rule, violations, result, in, a, disqualification, as, the, referee, may, be, depicted, as, using, his, own, judgement, and, is, not, obligated, to, stop, the, match, usually, the, only, offenses, that, the, referee, will, see, and, immediately, disqualify, a, wrestler, for, as, opposed, to, having, multiple, offenses, are, low, blows, weapon, usage, interference, or, assaulting, the, referee, in, wwe, the, plot, convention, is, that, a, referee, must, see, the, violation, with, his, own, eyes, to, rule, that, the, match, end, in, a, disqualification, simply, watching, the, video, tape, is, usually, not, enough, and, the, referee, s, ruling, is, almost, always, final, although, dusty, finishes, named, after, and, made, famous, by, dusty, rhodes, will, often, result, in, the, referee, s, decision, being, overturned, it, is, not, uncommon, for, the, referees, themselves, to, get, knocked, out, during, a, match, which, is, commonly, referred, to, by, the, term, ref, bump, while, the, referee, remains, unconscious, wrestlers, are, free, to, violate, rules, until, he, is, revived, or, replaced, in, some, cases, a, referee, might, disqualify, a, person, under, the, presumption, that, it, was, that, wrestler, who, knocked, him, out, most, referee, knockouts, are, arranged, to, allow, a, wrestler, usually, a, heel, to, gain, an, advantage, for, example, a, wrestler, may, get, whipped, into, a, referee, at, a, slower, speed, knocking, the, ref, down, for, short, amount, of, time, during, that, interim, period, one, wrestler, may, pin, his, opponent, for, a, three, count, and, would, have, won, the, match, but, for, the, referee, being, down, sometimes, another, referee, will, sprint, to, the, ring, from, backstage, to, attempt, to, make, the, count, but, by, then, the, other, wrestler, has, had, enough, time, to, kick, out, on, his, own, accord, in, most, promotions, a, championship, title, cannot, normally, change, hands, via, disqualification, this, rule, is, explicitly, enforced, in, a, title, match, under, special, circumstances, in, traditional, european, promotions, severe, or, persistent, infractions, of, the, rules, result, in, a, formal, caution, called, a, public, warning, in, the, u, k, avertissement, warning, in, france, and, a, soccer, style, yellow, card, in, germany, three, of, these, will, result, in, disqualification, a, red, card, in, germany, one, major, north, american, promotion, stampede, wrestling, of, calgary, also, used, the, german, card, system, from, the, late, 1970s, onward, if, all, participants, in, a, match, continue, to, breach, the, referee, s, instructions, the, staged, performance, may, presented, as, ending, in, a, double, disqualification, where, both, wrestlers, and, or, teams, in, a, tag, team, match, have, been, disqualified, the, match, is, essentially, nullified, and, called, a, draw, or, in, some, cases, a, restart, or, the, same, match, being, held, at, a, pay, per, view, or, next, night, s, show, sometimes, in, a, match, to, determine, the, challenger, for, a, heel, champion, s, title, the, champion, is, forced, to, face, both, opponents, simultaneously, for, the, title, usually, the, double, disqualification, is, caused, by, the, heel, wrestler, s, associates, in, a, match, between, two, face, wrestlers, to, determine, his, opponent, although, extremely, rare, some, fictional, storylines, involve, a, match, ending, in, a, forfeit, if, the, opponent, is, depicted, as, either, does, not, show, up, for, the, match, or, shows, up, but, refuses, to, compete, although, the, plot, premise, is, that, championship, usually, cannot, change, hands, except, by, pinfall, or, submission, a, forfeit, victory, is, enough, to, crown, a, new, champion, a, famous, example, of, this, happened, on, the, december, 8, 1997, episode, of, raw, is, war, when, stone, cold, steve, austin, handed, the, wwe, intercontinental, championship, to, the, rock, after, refusing, to, defend, the, title, when, a, pay, per, view, match, is, booked, and, one, wrestler, is, unable, to, make, it, for, one, reason, or, another, the, genre, convention, is, to, insert, a, last, minute, replacement, rather, than, award, a, wrestler, a, victory, by, forfeit, forfeit, victories, are, almost, always, reserved, for, when, the, story, the, promotion, is, telling, specifically, requires, such, an, ending, despite, being, statistically, an, extremely, rare, occurrence, charles, wright, is, one, wrestler, who, is, famous, performances, in, which, forfeit, victories, were, turned, into, his, own, gimmick, during, the, late, 1990s, wright, called, himself, the, godfather, and, portrayed, the, gimmick, of, a, pimp, he, often, brought, multiple, women, whom, he, referred, to, as, hos, to, the, ring, with, him, and, offered, them, to, his, opponents, in, exchange, for, their, forfeit, a, professional, wrestling, match, can, be, depicted, as, ending, in, a, draw, a, draw, occurs, if, both, opponents, are, simultaneously, disqualified, e, g, brock, lesnar, vs, the, undertaker, at, unforgiven, in, 2002, neither, opponent, is, able, to, answer, a, ten, count, e, g, shawn, michaels, vs, triple, h, at, the, royal, rumble, in, 2004, or, both, opponents, simultaneously, win, the, match, the, latter, can, occur, if, for, example, both, wrestlers, pin, each, other, e, g, mjf, vs, adam, cole, at, all, in, in, 2023, before, the, match, was, restarted, or, one, competitor, scores, a, submission, victory, while, the, other, scores, a, pinfall, victory, e, g, kurt, angle, being, pinned, while, successfully, applying, the, triangle, choke, to, the, undertaker, on, a, 2002, episode, of, smackdown, traditionally, a, championship, may, not, change, hands, in, the, event, of, a, draw, a, variant, of, the, draw, is, the, time, limit, draw, where, the, match, does, not, have, a, winner, by, a, specified, time, period, a, one, hour, draw, which, was, once, common, is, known, in, wrestling, circles, as, a, broadway, in, european, promotions, where, wrestling, is, traditionally, timed, in, rounds, a, best, of, three, falls, match, is, stopped, and, declared, a, one, fall, each, draw, if, an, equalizing, pinfall, or, submission, is, scored, in, the, final, round, a, wrestling, match, may, be, declared, a, no, contest, if, under, the, fictional, storyline, the, winning, conditions, are, unable, to, occur, the, storyline, may, attribute, such, an, outcome, to, factors, such, as, excessive, interference, the, loss, of, referee, s, control, over, the, match, an, injury, unrelated, to, the, fictitious, storyline, or, other, fictional, circumstances, presenting, the, scheduled, match, to, even, begin, a, no, contest, is, a, state, separate, and, distinct, from, a, draw, a, draw, indicates, winning, conditions, were, met, although, the, terms, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, in, practice, this, usage, is, technically, incorrect, while, each, wrestling, match, is, ostensibly, a, competition, of, athletics, and, strategy, the, goal, from, a, business, standpoint, is, to, excite, and, entertain, the, audience, although, the, competition, is, staged, dramatic, emphasis, draws, out, the, most, intense, reaction, heightened, interest, results, in, higher, attendance, increased, ticket, sales, higher, ratings, on, television, broadcasts, greater, ad, revenue, higher, pay, per, view, buyrates, and, sales, of, branded, merchandise, and, recorded, video, footage, all, of, these, contribute, to, the, profit, of, the, promotion, company, in, latin, america, and, english, speaking, countries, most, wrestlers, and, other, on, stage, performers, portray, character, roles, sometimes, with, personalities, wildly, different, from, their, own, these, personalities, are, a, gimmick, intended, to, heighten, interest, in, a, wrestler, without, regard, to, athletic, ability, some, can, be, unrealistic, and, cartoon, like, such, as, doink, the, clown, while, others, carry, more, verisimilitude, such, as, chris, jericho, the, rock, john, cena, steve, austin, and, cm, punk, in, lucha, libre, many, characters, wear, masks, adopting, a, secret, identity, akin, to, a, superhero, or, a, supervillain, a, near, sacred, tradition, an, individual, wrestler, may, use, their, real, name, or, a, minor, variation, of, it, for, much, of, their, career, such, as, bret, hart, john, cena, and, randy, orton, others, can, keep, one, ring, name, for, their, entire, career, shawn, michaels, cm, punk, and, ricky, steamboat, or, may, change, from, time, to, time, to, better, suit, the, demands, of, the, audience, or, company, sometimes, a, character, is, owned, and, trademarked, by, the, company, forcing, the, wrestler, to, find, a, new, one, when, he, leaves, although, a, simple, typeset, change, such, as, changing, rhyno, to, rhino, can, get, around, this, and, sometimes, a, character, is, owned, by, the, wrestler, sometimes, a, wrestler, may, change, their, legal, name, to, obtain, ownership, of, their, ring, name, andrew, martin, and, warrior, many, wrestlers, such, as, the, rock, and, the, undertaker, are, strongly, identified, with, their, character, even, responding, to, the, name, in, public, or, between, friends, proper, decorum, is, for, wrestlers, to, refer, to, each, other, by, their, stage, names, characters, rather, than, their, birth, legal, names, unless, otherwise, introduced, a, character, can, become, so, popular, that, it, appears, in, other, media, hulk, hogan, and, el, santo, or, even, gives, the, performer, enough, visibility, to, enter, politics, antonio, inoki, and, jesse, ventura, typically, matches, are, staged, between, a, protagonist, historically, an, audience, favorite, known, as, a, babyface, or, the, good, guy, and, an, antagonist, historically, a, villain, with, arrogance, a, tendency, to, break, rules, or, other, unlikable, qualities, called, a, heel, or, the, bad, guy, in, recent, years, antiheroes, have, also, become, prominent, in, professional, wrestling, there, is, also, a, less, common, role, of, a, tweener, who, is, neither, fully, face, nor, fully, heel, yet, able, to, play, either, role, effectively, case, in, point, samoa, joe, during, his, first, run, in, impact, wrestling, from, june, 2005, to, november, 2006, at, times, a, character, may, turn, altering, their, face, heel, alignment, this, may, be, an, abrupt, surprising, event, or, it, may, slowly, build, over, time, it, is, almost, always, accomplished, with, a, markable, change, in, behavior, some, turns, become, defining, points, in, a, career, as, when, hulk, hogan, turned, heel, after, being, a, top, face, for, over, a, decade, others, may, have, no, noticeable, effect, on, the, character, s, status, if, a, character, repeatedly, switches, between, face, and, heel, this, lessens, the, effect, of, such, turns, and, may, result, in, apathy, from, the, audience, big, show, is, a, good, example, of, having, more, heel, and, face, turns, than, anyone, in, wwe, history, sometimes, a, character, s, heel, turn, will, become, so, popular, that, eventually, the, audience, response, will, alter, the, character, s, heel, face, cycle, to, the, point, where, the, heel, persona, will, in, practice, become, a, face, persona, and, what, was, previously, the, face, persona, will, turn, into, the, heel, persona, such, as, when, dwayne, johnson, first, began, using, the, rock, persona, as, a, heel, character, as, opposed, to, his, original, rocky, maivia, babyface, persona, another, legendary, example, is, stone, cold, steve, austin, who, was, originally, booked, as, a, heel, with, such, mannerisms, as, drinking, on, the, job, using, profanity, breaking, company, property, and, even, breaking, into, people, s, private, homes, the, fans, response, to, austin, was, so, positive, that, he, effectively, became, one, of, the, most, popular, antiheroes, in, professional, wrestling, austin, along, with, the, stable, of, d, generation, x, bret, hart, and, his, hart, foundation, is, generally, credited, with, ushering, the, attitude, era, of, wwf, programming, while, real, exhibition, matches, are, now, not, uncommon, most, matches, tell, a, story, analogous, to, an, episode, of, a, serial, drama, the, face, will, from, time, to, time, win, triumph, or, from, time, to, time, lose, tragedy, and, longer, story, arcs, can, result, from, a, couple, of, matches, since, most, promotions, have, a, championship, title, opposition, for, the, championship, is, a, frequent, impetus, for, stories, for, added, stakes, anything, from, a, character, s, own, hair, to, their, job, can, be, wagered, in, a, match, some, matches, are, designed, to, further, the, story, of, only, one, participant, it, could, be, intended, to, portray, an, unstoppable, force, a, lucky, underdog, a, sore, loser, or, any, other, characterization, sometimes, non, wrestling, vignettes, are, shown, to, enhance, a, character, s, image, without, the, need, for, matches, other, stories, result, from, a, natural, rivalry, outside, of, performance, these, are, referred, to, as, feuds, a, feud, can, exist, between, any, number, of, participants, and, can, last, from, a, few, days, to, decades, the, feud, between, ric, flair, and, ricky, steamboat, lasted, from, the, late, 1970s, into, the, early, 1990s, and, allegedly, spanned, over, two, thousand, matches, although, most, of, those, matches, were, mere, dark, matches, the, career, spanning, history, between, characters, mike, awesome, and, masato, tanaka, is, another, example, of, a, long, running, feud, as, is, the, case, of, steve, austin, vs, vince, mcmahon, one, of, the, most, lucrative, feuds, in, the, world, wrestling, federation, during, 1998, and, 1999, in, theory, the, longer, a, feud, is, built, up, the, more, audience, interest, aka, heat, lasts, the, main, event, of, a, wrestling, show, is, generally, the, most, heated, commonly, a, heel, will, hold, the, upper, hand, over, a, face, until, a, final, showdown, heightening, dramatic, tension, as, the, face, s, fans, desire, to, see, them, win, throughout, the, history, of, professional, wrestling, many, other, elements, of, media, have, been, utilized, in, professional, wrestling, storytelling, pre, and, post, match, interviews, backstage, skits, positions, of, authority, and, worked, behind, the, scenes, feuds, division, rankings, typically, the, 1, contendership, spot, contracts, lotteries, news, stories, on, websites, and, in, recent, years, social, media, anything, that, can, be, used, as, an, element, of, drama, can, exist, in, professional, wrestling, stories, romantic, relationships, including, love, triangles, and, marriage, racism, classism, nepotism, favoritism, corporate, corruption, family, bonds, personal, histories, grudges, theft, cheating, assault, betrayal, bribery, seduction, stalking, confidence, tricks, extortion, blackmail, substance, abuse, self, doubt, self, sacrifice, even, kidnapping, sexual, fetishism, necrophilia, misogyny, rape, and, death, have, been, portrayed, in, wrestling, some, promotions, have, included, supernatural, elements, such, as, magic, curses, the, undead, and, satanic, imagery, most, notably, the, undertaker, and, his, ministry, of, darkness, a, stable, that, regularly, performed, evil, rituals, and, human, sacrifice, in, satanic, like, worship, of, a, hidden, power, figure, commentators, have, become, important, in, communicating, the, relevance, of, the, characters, actions, to, the, story, at, hand, filling, in, past, details, and, pointing, out, subtle, actions, that, may, otherwise, go, unnoticed, a, main, part, of, storytelling, in, wrestling, is, a, promo, short, for, promotional, interview, promos, are, performed, or, cut, in, wrestling, jargon, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, to, heighten, interest, in, a, wrestler, or, to, hype, an, upcoming, match, since, the, crowd, is, often, too, loud, or, the, venue, too, large, for, promos, to, be, heard, naturally, wrestlers, generally, use, amplification, when, speaking, in, the, ring, unlike, most, stage, acting, large, and, highly, visible, handheld, microphones, are, typically, used, and, wrestlers, frequently, speak, directly, to, the, audience, professional, wrestling, mimics, the, structure, of, title, match, combat, sports, participants, compete, for, a, championship, and, must, defend, it, after, winning, it, these, titles, are, represented, physically, by, a, title, belt, that, can, be, worn, by, the, champion, in, the, case, of, team, wrestling, there, is, a, title, belt, for, each, member, of, the, team, almost, all, professional, wrestling, promotions, have, at, least, one, title, and, some, have, more, championships, are, designated, by, divisions, of, weight, height, gender, wrestling, style, and, other, qualifications, typically, each, promotion, only, recognizes, the, legitimacy, of, their, own, titles, although, cross, promotion, does, happen, when, one, promotion, absorbs, or, purchases, another, the, titles, from, the, defunct, promotion, may, continue, to, be, defended, in, the, new, promotion, or, be, decommissioned, behind, the, scenes, the, bookers, in, a, company, will, place, the, title, on, the, most, accomplished, performer, or, those, the, bookers, believe, will, generate, fan, interest, in, terms, of, event, attendance, and, television, viewership, historically, a, world, champion, was, typically, a, legit, shooter, hooker, who, had, the, skills, to, prevent, double, crosses, by, shooters, who, would, deviate, from, the, planned, finish, for, personal, glory, lower, ranked, titles, may, also, be, used, on, the, performers, who, show, potential, thus, allowing, them, greater, exposure, to, the, audience, other, circumstances, may, also, determine, the, use, of, a, championship, a, combination, of, a, championship, s, lineage, the, caliber, of, performers, as, champion, and, the, frequency, and, manner, of, title, changes, dictates, the, audience, s, perception, of, the, title, s, quality, significance, and, reputation, a, wrestler, s, championship, accomplishments, can, be, central, to, their, career, becoming, a, measure, of, their, performance, ability, and, drawing, power, in, general, a, wrestler, with, multiple, title, reigns, or, an, extended, title, reign, is, indicative, of, a, wrestler, s, ability, to, maintain, audience, interest, or, a, wrestler, s, ability, to, perform, in, the, ring, as, such, the, most, accomplished, or, decorated, wrestlers, tend, to, be, revered, as, legends, due, to, the, amount, of, title, reigns, they, hold, american, wrestler, ric, flair, has, had, multiple, world, heavyweight, championship, reigns, spanning, over, three, decades, japanese, wrestler, ltimo, drag, n, once, held, and, defended, a, record, ten, titles, simultaneously, while, the, wrestling, matches, themselves, are, the, primary, focus, of, professional, wrestling, a, key, dramatic, element, of, the, business, can, be, entrances, of, the, wrestlers, to, the, arena, and, ring, it, is, typical, for, a, wrestler, to, get, their, biggest, crowd, reaction, or, pop, for, their, ring, entrance, rather, than, for, anything, they, do, in, the, wrestling, match, itself, especially, if, former, main, event, stars, are, returning, to, a, promotion, after, a, long, absence, all, notable, wrestlers, now, enter, the, ring, accompanied, by, music, and, regularly, add, other, elements, to, their, entrance, the, music, played, during, the, ring, entrance, will, usually, mirror, the, wrestler, s, personality, many, wrestlers, particularly, in, the, u, s, have, music, and, lyrics, specially, written, for, their, ring, entrance, while, invented, long, before, the, practice, of, including, music, with, the, entrance, gained, rapid, popularity, during, the, 1980s, largely, as, a, result, of, the, huge, success, of, hulk, hogan, and, the, wwf, and, their, rock, n, wrestling, connection, when, a, match, is, won, the, victor, s, theme, music, is, usually, also, played, in, celebration, because, wrestling, is, predetermined, a, wrestler, s, entrance, music, will, play, as, they, enter, the, arena, even, if, they, are, in, kayfabe, not, supposed, to, be, there, for, example, in, 2012, through, 2014, the, shield, was, a, trio, of, wrestlers, who, were, in, kayfabe, not, at, the, time, under, contract, with, wwe, hence, their, gimmick, of, entering, the, ring, through, the, crowd, but, they, still, had, entrance, music, which, was, played, whenever, they, entered, the, arena, despite, the, fact, that, they, were, kayfabe, invaders, with, the, introduction, of, the, titantron, entrance, screen, in, 1997, wwf, wrestlers, also, had, entrance, videos, play, along, with, their, music, other, dramatic, elements, of, a, ring, entrance, can, include, special, ring, entrances, are, also, developed, for, big, occasions, most, notably, the, wrestlemania, event, for, example, wrestlemania, iii, and, vi, both, saw, all, wrestlers, enter, the, arena, on, motorized, miniature, wrestling, rings, live, bands, are, sometimes, hired, to, perform, live, entrance, music, at, special, events, john, cena, and, triple, h, are, particularly, notable, in, recent, years, for, their, highly, theatrical, entrances, at, wrestlemania, the, women, s, division, of, professional, wrestling, has, maintained, a, recognized, world, champion, since, 1937, when, mildred, burke, won, the, original, world, women, s, title, she, then, formed, the, world, women, s, wrestling, association, in, the, early, 1950s, and, recognized, herself, as, the, first, champion, although, the, championship, was, vacated, upon, her, retirement, in, 1956, the, nwa, ceased, to, acknowledge, burke, as, the, women, s, world, champion, in, 1954, and, instead, acknowledged, june, byers, as, champion, after, a, controversial, finish, to, a, high, profile, match, between, burke, and, byers, that, year, upon, byers, s, retirement, in, 1964, the, fabulous, moolah, who, won, a, junior, heavyweight, version, of, the, nwa, world, women, s, championship, the, predecessor, to, the, wwe, women, s, championship, in, a, tournament, back, in, 1958, was, recognized, by, most, nwa, promoters, as, champion, by, default, for, most, of, its, history, men, and, women, rarely, worked, against, each, other, in, professional, wrestling, as, it, was, deemed, to, be, unfair, and, unchivalrous, andy, kaufman, used, this, to, gain, notoriety, when, he, created, an, intergender, championship, and, declared, it, open, to, any, female, challenger, this, led, to, a, long, worked, feud, with, jerry, lawler, cathy, davis, sued, the, new, york, state, athletic, commission, nysac, in, 1977, because,

prevalence, of, midgets, in, wrestling, has, greatly, decreased, due, to, wrestling, companies, depriving, midget, divisions, of, storyline, or, feud, wwe, has, made, a, few, attempts, to, enter, this, market, with, their, minis, in, the, 1990s, and, the, junior, s, league, as, recent, as, 2006, it, is, still, a, popular, form, of, entertainment, in, mexican, wrestling, mostly, as, a, sideshow, some, wrestlers, may, have, their, own, specific, mini, me, like, mascarita, sagrada, alebrije, has, quije, etc, there, are, also, cases, in, which, midgets, can, become, valets, for, a, wrestler, and, even, get, physically, involved, in, matches, like, alushe, who, often, accompanies, tinieblas, or, kemonito, who, is, portrayed, as, consejo, mundial, de, lucha, libre, s, mascot, and, is, also, a, valet, for, mistico, dave, finlay, was, often, aided, in, his, matches, by, a, midget, known, mainly, as, hornswoggle, while, in, wwe, who, hid, under, the, ring, and, gave, a, shillelagh, to, finlay, to, use, on, his, opponent, finlay, also, occasionally, threw, him, at, his, opponents, hornswoggle, was, given, a, run, with, the, wwe, cruiserweight, championship, and, feuded, with, d, x, in, 2009, the, term, sports, entertainment, was, coined, by, the, world, wrestling, federation, wwf, now, wwe, chairman, vince, mcmahon, during, the, 1980s, as, a, marketing, term, to, describe, the, industry, of, professional, wrestling, primarily, to, potential, advertisers, although, precursors, date, back, to, february, 1935, when, toronto, star, sports, editor, lou, marsh, described, professional, wrestling, as, sportive, entertainment, in, 1989, the, wwf, used, the, phrase, in, a, case, it, made, to, the, new, jersey, senate, for, classifying, professional, wrestling, as, sports, entertainment, and, thus, not, subject, to, regulation, like, a, directly, competitive, sport, in, subsequent, years, wwe, began, to, insist, that, its, talent, use, sports, entertainment, and, not, pro, wrestling, to, describe, its, business, to, the, point, that, the, term, was, sometimes, used, in, other, promotions, to, generate, heat, wwe, moved, away, from, this, insistence, in, 2024, after, vince, mcmahon, s, departure, from, the, company, but, still, uses, sports, entertainment, in, some, contexts, despite, its, association, with, wwe, the, term, sports, entertainment, is, not, inherently, limited, to, pro, wrestling, and, can, also, encompass, other, forms, of, sports, based, events, many, represent, variants, of, actual, sports, such, as, exhibition, basketball, with, the, harlem, globetrotters, others, modify, sport, for, entertainment, purposes, such, as, many, of, the, various, mascot, races, held, at, numerous, major, league, baseball, games, in, between, innings, roller, derby, was, presented, as, a, popular, form, of, sports, entertainment, in, the, 1970s, though, modern, versions, are, legitimate, competition, the, u, s, canada, northwest, europe, the, u, k, germany, austria, and, france, japan, and, mexico, are, four, areas, worldwide, where, there, is, a, huge, market, and, high, popularity, for, professional, wrestling, but, the, fictional, styles, of, each, region, are, different, given, their, independent, development, for, a, long, period, professional, wrestling, in, the, u, s, and, overlapping, into, canada, tends, to, have, a, heavy, focus, on, story, building, and, the, establishment, of, characters, and, their, personalities, there, is, a, story, for, each, match, and, even, a, longer, story, for, successive, matches, the, stories, usually, contain, characters, like, faces, heels, and, less, often, tweeners, antiheroes, it, is, a, triumph, if, the, face, wins, while, it, is, a, tragedy, if, the, heel, wins, the, characters, usually, have, strong, and, sharp, personalities, the, opposition, between, faces, and, heels, is, very, intense, in, the, story, and, the, heels, may, even, attack, the, faces, during, tv, interviews, the, relationship, between, different, characters, can, also, be, very, complex, although, professional, wrestling, in, mexico, lucha, libre, also, has, stories, and, characters, they, are, less, emphasized, mexican, professional, wrestling, tradition, repeats, very, usually, brutal, tactics, specially, more, aerial, holds, than, professional, wrestlers, in, the, u, s, who, more, often, rely, on, power, moves, and, strikes, to, subdue, their, opponents, the, difference, in, styles, is, due, to, the, independent, evolution, of, the, sport, in, mexico, beginning, in, the, 1930s, and, the, fact, that, wrestlers, in, the, cruiserweight, division, spanish, peso, semicompleto, are, often, the, most, popular, wrestlers, in, mexican, lucha, libre, wrestlers, often, execute, high, flying, moves, characteristic, of, lucha, libre, by, utilizing, the, wrestling, ring, s, ropes, to, catapult, themselves, towards, their, opponents, using, intricate, combinations, in, rapid, fire, succession, and, applying, complex, submission, holds, lucha, libre, is, also, known, for, its, tag, team, wrestling, matches, in, which, the, teams, are, often, made, up, of, three, members, instead, of, two, as, is, common, in, the, u, s, the, style, of, japanese, professional, wrestling, puroresu, is, also, different, with, its, origins, in, traditional, american, style, of, wrestling, and, still, being, under, the, same, genre, it, has, become, an, entity, in, itself, despite, the, similarity, to, its, american, counterpart, in, that, the, outcome, of, the, matches, remains, predetermined, the, phenomena, are, different, in, the, form, of, the, psychology, and, presentation, of, the, sport, in, most, of, the, largest, promotions, such, as, new, japan, pro, wrestling, all, japan, pro, wrestling, and, pro, wrestling, noah, it, is, treated, as, a, full, contact, combat, sport, as, it, mixes, hard, hitting, martial, arts, strikes, with, shoot, style, submission, holds, while, in, the, u, s, it, is, rather, more, regarded, as, an, entertainment, show, wrestlers, incorporate, kicks, and, strikes, from, martial, arts, disciplines, and, a, strong, emphasis, is, placed, on, submission, wrestling, and, unlike, the, use, of, involved, storylines, in, the, u, s, they, are, not, as, intricate, in, japan, more, emphasis, is, placed, on, the, concept, of, fighting, spirit, meaning, the, wrestlers, display, of, physical, and, mental, stamina, are, valued, a, lot, more, than, theatrics, many, of, japan, s, wrestlers, including, top, stars, such, as, shinya, hashimoto, riki, ch, sh, and, keiji, mutoh, came, from, a, legitimate, martial, arts, background, and, many, japanese, wrestlers, in, the, 1990s, began, to, pursue, careers, in, mixed, martial, arts, organizations, such, as, pancrase, and, shooto, which, at, the, time, retained, the, original, look, of, puroresu, but, were, actual, competitions, other, companies, such, as, michinoku, pro, wrestling, and, dragon, gate, wrestle, in, a, style, similar, to, mexican, companies, like, aaa, and, cmll, this, is, known, as, lucharesu, much, of, the, more, serious, style, of, japanese, wrestling, derives, from, wrestling, in, europe, particularly, the, influence, of, the, traditional, style, of, british, wrestling, with, its, stronger, emphasis, on, pure, technical, skill, particularly, chain, sequences, of, counters, reversals, escapes, from, holds, and, high, proportion, of, clean, sportsmanly, scientific, matches, between, two, blue, eyes, as, babyfaces, were,

from, his, book, mythologies, first, published, in, 1957, barthes, argued, that, it, should, be, looked, at, not, as, a, scamming, of, the, ignorant, but, as, spectacle, a, mode, of, theatric, performance, for, a, willing, if, bloodthirsty, audience, wrestling, is, described, as, performed, art, which, demands, an, immediate, reading, of, the, juxtaposed, meanings, the, logical, conclusion, is, given, least, importance, over, the, theatrical, performers, of, the, wrestlers, and, the, referee, according, to, barthes, the, function, of, a, wrestler, is, not, to, win, it, is, to, go, exactly, through, the, motions, which, are, expected, of, him, and, to, give, the, audience, a, theatrical, spectacle, this, work, is, considered, a, foundation, of, all, later, study, while, pro,
