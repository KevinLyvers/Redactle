a, pu, ko, wo, ko, possibly, meaning, headband, makers, or, craftsmen, of, horse, veil, and, written, in, linear, b, syllabic, script, is, also, attested, since, ca, 1300, bc, in, ancient, greek, the, word, for, veil, was, kalyptra, ionic, greek, kalyptr, from, the, verb, kalypt, i, cover, classical, greek, and, hellenistic, statues, sometimes, depict, greek, women, with, both, their, head, and, face, covered, by, a, veil, caroline, galt, and, lloyd, llewellyn, jones, have, both, argued, from, such, representations, and, literary, references, that, it, was, commonplace, for, women, at, least, those, of, higher, status, in, ancient, greece, to, cover, their, hair, and, face, in, public, roman, women, were, expected, to, wear, veils, as, a, symbol, of, the, husband, s, authority, over, his, wife, a, married, woman, who, omitted, the, veil, was, seen, as, withdrawing, herself, from, marriage, in, 166, bc, consul, sulpicius, gallus, divorced, his, wife, because, she, had, left, the, house, unveiled, thus, allowing, all, to, see, as, he, said, what, only, he, should, see, unmarried, girls, normally, did, not, veil, their, heads, but, matrons, did, so, to, show, their, modesty, and, chastity, their, pudicitia, veils, also, protected, women, against, the, evil, eye, it, was, thought, a, veil, called, flammeum, was, the, most, prominent, feature, of, the, costume, worn, by, the, bride, at, roman, weddings, the, veil, was, a, deep, yellow, color, reminiscent, of, a, candle, flame, the, flammeum, also, evoked, the, veil, of, the, flaminica, dialis, the, roman, priestess, who, could, not, divorce, her, husband, the, high, priest, of, jupiter, and, thus, was, seen, as, a, good, omen, for, lifelong, fidelity, to, one, man, the, romans, apparently, thought, of, the, bride, as, being, clouded, over, with, a, veil, and, connected, the, verb, nubere, to, be, married, with, nubes, the, word, for, cloud, intermixing, of, populations, resulted, in, a, convergence, of, the, cultural, practices, of, greek, persian, and, mesopotamian, empires, and, the, semitic, pealing, peoples, of, the, middle, east, with, the, spread, of, christianity, the, ordinance, of, headcovering, by, women, became, normative, throughout, christendom, because, it, was, enjoined, in, the, bible, and, by, the, church, fathers, veiling, and, seclusion, of, women, appear, to, have, established, themselves, among, jews, and, christians, before, spreading, to, urban, arabs, of, the, upper, classes, and, eventually, among, the, urban, masses, in, the, rural, areas, it, was, common, to, cover, the, hair, but, not, the, face, for, many, centuries, until, around, 1175, anglo, saxon, and, then, anglo, norman, women, with, the, exception, of, young, unmarried, girls, wore, veils, that, entirely, covered, their, hair, and, often, their, necks, up, to, their, chins, see, wimple, only, in, the, tudor, period, 1485, when, hoods, became, increasingly, popular, did, veils, of, this, type, become, less, common, this, varied, greatly, from, one, country, to, another, in, italy, veils, including, face, veils, were, worn, in, some, regions, until, the, 1970s, women, in, southern, italy, often, covered, their, heads, to, show, that, they, were, modest, well, behaved, and, pious, they, generally, wore, a, cuffia, cap, then, the, fazzoletto, kerchief, head, scarves, a, long, triangular, or, rectangular, piece, of, cloth, that, could, be, tied, in, various, ways, and, sometimes, covered, the, whole, face, except, the, eyes, sometimes, bende, lit, swaddles, bandages, or, a, wimple, underneath, too, for, centuries, european, women, have, worn, sheer, veils, but, only, under, certain, circumstances, sometimes, a, veil, of, this, type, was, draped, over, and, pinned, to, the, bonnet, or, hat, of, a, woman, in, mourning, especially, at, the, funeral, and, during, the, subsequent, period, of, high, mourning, they, would, also, have, been, used, as, an, alternative, to, a, mask, as, a, simple, method, of, hiding, the, identity, of, a, woman, who, was, traveling, to, meet, a, lover, or, doing, anything, she, did, not, want, other, people, to, find, out, about, more, pragmatically, veils, were, also, sometimes, worn, to, protect, the, complexion, from, sun, and, wind, damage, when, untanned, skin, was, fashionable, or, to, keep, dust, out, of, a, woman, s, face, much, as, the, keffiyeh, worn, by, men, is, used, today, in, judaism, christianity, and, islam, the, concept, of, covering, the, head, is, or, was, associated, with, propriety, and, modesty, most, traditional, depictions, of, the, virgin, mary, the, mother, of, christ, show, her, veiled, during, the, middle, ages, most, european, married, women, covered, their, hair, rather, than, their, face, with, a, variety, of, styles, of, wimple, kerchiefs, and, headscarves, veiling, covering, the, hair, was, the, normative, practice, of, christian, women, until, at, least, the, 19th, century, and, still, extant, in, certain, regions, in, accordance, with, christian, teaching, delineated, by, saint, paul, in, 1, corinthians, 11, while, in, the, western, world, this, practice, largely, lapsed, in, the, 1960s, with, the, rise, of, the, sexual, revolution, traditional, congregations, such, as, those, of, conservative, anabaptist, christians, as, well, as, certain, oriental, orthodox, christians, and, eastern, orthodox, christians, continue, observing, the, ordinance, of, headcovering, other, christian, women, including, certain, catholic, and, lutheran, as, well, as, certain, conservative, reformed, christian, women, such, as, those, belonging, to, the, heritage, reformed, congregations, or, free, presbyterian, church, of, north, america, continue, to, wear, a, headcovering, at, least, during, prayer, and, worship, lace, face, veils, are, often, worn, by, female, relatives, at, funerals, in, some, catholic, countries, in, orthodox, judaism, married, women, cover, their, hair, for, reasons, of, modesty, many, orthodox, jewish, women, wear, headscarves, tichel, for, this, purpose, christian, byzantine, literature, expressed, rigid, norms, pertaining, to, veiling, of, women, which, have, been, influenced, by, persian, traditions, although, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, they, differed, significantly, from, actual, practice, since, islam, identified, with, the, monotheistic, religions, practiced, in, the, byzantine, and, sasanian, empires, in, the, aftermath, of, the, early, muslim, conquests, veiling, of, women, was, adopted, as, an, appropriate, expression, of, qur, anic, ideals, regarding, modesty, and, piety, veiling, gradually, spread, to, upper, class, arab, women, and, eventually, it, became, widespread, among, muslim, women, in, cities, throughout, the, middle, east, veiling, of, arab, muslim, women, became, especially, pervasive, under, ottoman, rule, as, a, mark, of, rank, and, exclusive, lifestyle, and, istanbul, of, the, 17th, century, witnessed, differentiated, dress, styles, that, reflected, geographical, and, occupational, identities, women, in, rural, areas, were, much, slower, to, adopt, veiling, because, the, garments, interfered, with, their, work, in, the, fields, since, wearing, a, veil, was, impractical, for, working, women, a, veiled, woman, silently, announced, that, her, husband, was, rich, enough, to, keep, her, idle, by, the, 19th, century, upper, class, urban, muslim, and, christian, women, in, egypt, wore, a, garment, which, included, a, head, cover, and, a, burqa, muslin, cloth, that, covered, the, lower, nose, and, the, mouth, up, to, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, rural, women, in, the, maghreb, and, egypt, put, on, a, face, veil, when, they, visited, urban, areas, as, a, sign, of, civilization, the, practice, of, veiling, gradually, declined, in, much, of, the, muslim, world, during, the, 20th, century, before, making, a, comeback, in, recent, decades, the, choice, or, the, forced, option, for, women, to, veil, remains, controversial, whether, a, personal, choice, as, an, outward, sign, of, religious, devotion, or, a, forced, one, because, of, extremist, groups, that, require, a, veil, under, severe, penalty, even, death, the, motives, and, reasons, for, wearing, a, hijab, are, wide, and, various, but, ultimately, depend, on, each, individual, person, s, situation, and, can, not, be, said, to, come, from, any, one, distinct, reason, or, motive, although, religion, can, be, a, common, reason, for, choosing, to, veil, the, practice, also, reflects, political, and, personal, conviction, so, that, it, can, serve, as, a, medium, through, which, personal, choices, can, be, revealed, in, countries, where, veiling, is, indeed, a, choice, such, as, turkey, among, the, tuareg, songhai, hausa, and, fulani, of, west, africa, women, do, not, traditionally, wear, the, veil, while, men, do, male, veiling, was, also, common, among, the, berber, sanhaja, tribes, the, north, african, male, veil, which, covers, the, mouth, and, sometimes, part, of, the, nose, is, called, litham, in, arabic, and, tagelmust, by, the, tuareg, tuareg, boys, start, wearing, the, veil, at, the, onset, of, puberty, and, veiling, is, regarded, as, a, mark, of, manhood, it, is, considered, improper, for, a, man, to, appear, unveiled, in, front, of, elders, especially, those, from, his, wife, s, family, ancient, african, rock, engravings, depicting, human, faces, with, eyes, but, no, mouth, or, nose, suggest, that, the, origins, of, litham, are, not, only, pre, islamic, but, even, pre, historic, wearing, of, the, litham, is, not, viewed, as, a, religious, requirement, although, it, was, apparently, believed, to, provide, magical, protection, against, evil, forces, in, practice, the, litham, has, served, as, protection, from, the, dust, and, extremes, of, temperature, characterizing, the, desert, environment, its, use, by, the, almoravids, gave, it, a, political, significance, during, their, conquests, in, some, parts, of, india, pakistan, bangladesh, and, nepal, men, wear, a, sehra, on, their, wedding, day, this, is, a, male, veil, covering, the, whole, face, and, neck, the, sehra, is, made, from, either, flowers, or, beads, the, most, common, sehra, headdress, is, made, from, fresh, marigolds, the, groom, wears, this, throughout, the, day, concealing, his, face, even, during, the, wedding, ceremony, in, northern, india, today, grooms, can, be, seen, arriving, on, a, horse, with, the, sehra, wrapped, around, the, head, biblical, references, include, note, genesis, 20, 16, which, the, king, james, version, renders, as, and, unto, sarah, he, said, behold, i, have, given, thy, brother, a, thousand, pieces, of, silver, behold, he, is, to, thee, a, covering, of, the, eyes, unto, all, that, are, with, thee, and, with, all, other, thus, she, was, reproved, has, been, interpreted, in, one, source, as, implied, advice, to, sarah, to, conform, to, a, supposed, custom, of, married, women, and, wear, a, complete, veil, covering, the, eyes, as, well, as, the, rest, of, the, face, but, the, phrase, is, generally, taken, to, refer, not, to, sarah, s, eyes, but, to, the, eyes, of, others, and, to, be, merely, a, metaphorical, expression, concerning, vindication, of, sarah, nasb, rsv, silencing, criticism, gwt, allaying, suspicions, njb, righting, a, wrong, bbe, nlt, covering, or, recompensing, the, problem, caused, her, niv, new, life, version, nirv, tniv, jb, a, sign, of, her, innocence, esv, cev, hcsb, the, final, phrase, in, the, verse, which, kjv, takes, to, mean, she, was, reproved, is, taken, by, almost, all, other, versions, to, mean, instead, she, was, vindicated, and, the, word, which, kjv, interprets, as, he, abraham, is, interpreted, as, it, the, money, thus, the, general, view, is, that, this, passage, has, nothing, to, do, with, material, veils, after, the, destruction, of, the, temple, in, jerusalem, the, synagogues, that, were, established, took, the, design, of, the, tabernacle, as, their, plan, the, ark, of, the, law, which, contains, the, scrolls, of, the, torah, is, covered, with, an, embroidered, curtain, or, veil, called, a, parokhet, see, also, below, regarding, the, traditional, jewish, custom, of, veiling, and, unveiling, the, bride, traditionally, in, christianity, women, were, enjoined, to, cover, their, heads, and, men, were, instructed, to, remove, their, hat, when, praying, or, prophesying, wearing, a, veil, also, known, as, a, headcovering, is, seen, as, a, sign, of, humility, before, god, as, well, as, a, reminder, of, the, bridal, relationship, between, christ, and, the, church, this, practice, is, based, on, 1, corinthians, 11, 4, 15, in, the, christian, bible, where, st, paul, writes, 2, i, commend, you, because, you, remember, me, in, everything, and, maintain, the, traditions, even, as, i, have, delivered, them, to, you, 3, but, i, want, you, to, understand, that, the, head, of, every, man, is, christ, the, head, of, a, woman, is, her, husband, and, the, head, of, christ, is, god, 4, any, man, who, prays, or, prophesies, with, his, head, covered, dishonors, his, head, 5, but, any, woman, who, prays, or, prophesies, with, her, head, unveiled, dishonors, her, head, it, is, the, same, as, if, her, head, were, shaven, 6, for, if, a, woman, will, not, veil, herself, then, she, should, cut, off, her, hair, but, if, it, is, disgraceful, for, a, woman, to, be, shorn, or, shaven, let, her, wear, a, veil, 7, for, a, man, ought, not, to, cover, his, head, since, he, is, the, image, and, glory, of, god, but, woman, is, the, glory, of, man, 8, for, man, was, not, made, from, woman, but, woman, from, man, 9, neither, was, man, created, for, woman, but, woman, for, man, 10, that, is, why, a, woman, ought, to, have, a, veil, on, her, head, because, of, the, angels, 11, nevertheless, in, the, lord, woman, is, not, independent, of, man, nor, man, of, woman, 12, for, as, woman, was, made, from, man, so, man, is, now, born, of, woman, and, all, things, are, from, god, 13, judge, for, yourselves, is, it, proper, for, a, woman, to, pray, to, god, with, her, head, uncovered, 14, does, not, nature, itself, teach, you, that, for, a, man, to, wear, long, hair, is, degrading, to, him, 15, but, if, a, woman, has, long, hair, it, is, her, pride, for, her, hair, is, given, to, her, for, a, covering, 16, if, any, one, is, disposed, to, be, contentious, we, recognize, no, other, practice, nor, do, the, churches, of, god, the, early, church, fathers, including, tertullian, of, carthage, clement, of, alexandria, hippolytus, of, rome, john, chrysostom, and, augustine, of, hippo, attested, in, their, writings, that, men, should, pray, uncovered, and, that, women, should, wear, a, headcovering, john, chrysostom, c, 347, 407, delineated, saint, paul, s, teaching, on, the, wearing, of, headcoverings, by, christian, women, continually, well, then, the, man, he, compelleth, not, to, be, always, uncovered, but, only, when, he, prays, for, every, man, saith, he, praying, or, prophesying, having, his, head, covered, dishonoureth, his, head, but, the, woman, he, commands, to, be, at, all, times, covered, wherefore, also, having, said, every, woman, that, prayeth, or, prophesieth, with, her, head, unveiled, dishonoureth, her, head, he, stayed, not, at, this, point, only, but, also, proceeded, to, say, for, it, is, one, and, the, same, thing, as, if, she, were, shaven, but, if, to, be, shaven, is, always, dishonourable, it, is, plain, too, that, being, uncovered, is, always, a, reproach, and, not, even, with, this, only, was, he, content, but, he, added, again, saying, the, woman, ought, to, have, a, sign, of, authority, on, her, head, because, of, the, angels, he, signifies, that, not, at, the, time, of, prayer, only, but, also, continually, she, ought, to, be, covered, but, with, regard, to, the, man, it, is, no, longer, about, covering, but, about, wearing, long, hair, that, he, so, forms, his, discourse, to, be, covered, he, then, only, forbids, when, a, man, is, praying, but, the, wearing, of, long, hair, he, discourages, at, all, times, for, he, said, not, merely, covered, but, covered, over, meaning, that, she, be, with, all, care, sheltered, from, view, on, every, side, and, by, reducing, it, to, an, absurdity, he, appeals, to, their, shame, saying, by, way, of, severe, reprimand, but, if, she, be, not, covered, let, her, also, be, shorn, as, if, he, had, said, if, thou, cast, away, the, covering, appointed, by, the, law, of, god, cast, away, likewise, that, appointed, by, nature, additionally, the, church, fathers, taught, that, because, the, hair, of, a, woman, has, sexual, potency, it, should, only, be, for, her, husband, to, see, and, covered, the, rest, of, the, time, in, western, europe, and, north, america, from, the, arrival, of, christianity, to, those, lands, to, the, mid, 20th, century, women, in, most, mainstream, christian, denominations, wore, head, coverings, often, in, the, form, of, a, scarf, cap, veil, or, hat, these, included, many, anglican, baptist, catholic, lutheran, methodist, moravian, and, reformed, including, continental, reformed, congregationalist, and, presbyterian, traditions, churches, in, these, denominations, the, practice, now, continues, in, certain, congregations, and, by, individuals, who, have, sought, to, follow, the, precedent, set, in, scripture, and, church, history, christian, veiling, throughout, the, day, is, still, practiced, by, those, who, wear, plain, dress, such, as, traditional, anabaptists, including, mennonites, old, order, mennonites, and, conservative, mennonites, hutterites, schwarzenau, brethren, old, order, schwarzenau, brethren, and, dunkard, brethren, church, river, brethren, old, order, river, brethren, and, calvary, holiness, church, apostolic, christians, amish, old, order, amish, new, order, amish, para, amish, and, beachy, amish, and, charity, christians, as, well, as, conservative, quakers, many, holiness, christians, who, practice, the, doctrine, of, outward, holiness, also, practice, headcovering, such, as, the, calvary, holiness, church, the, plymouth, brethren, and, conservative, reformed, and, presbyterian, churches, along, with, traditionalist, catholics, practice, headcovering, when, praying, at, home, and, while, attending, public, liturgies, in, many, oriental, orthodox, churches, and, certain, eastern, orthodox, congregations, the, custom, of, women, s, covering, their, heads, continues, in, church, and, when, praying, privately, at, home, a, veil, forms, part, of, the, headdress, of, some, orders, of, nuns, or, religious, sisters, in, catholicism, lutheranism, and, anglicanism, this, is, why, a, woman, who, becomes, a, nun, is, said, to, take, the, veil, in, medieval, times, married, women, normally, covered, their, hair, outside, the, house, and, a, nun, s, veil, is, based, on, secular, medieval, styles, often, reflecting, the, fashion, of, widows, in, their, attire, in, many, institutes, a, white, veil, is, used, as, the, veil, of, probation, during, novitiate, a, black, veil, is, the, traditional, sign, of, a, professed, nun, some, monasteries, or, communities, bestow, the, black, veil, at, the, first, profession, of, vows, but, usually, it, is, bestowed, with, the, profession, of, solemn, vows, when, the, vows, have, been, professed, the, white, veil, of, a, novice, will, be, swapped, for, the, black, veil, of, the, professed, and, she, is, usually, crowned, with, a, wreath, of, flowers, a, veil, of, consecration, longer, and, fuller, is, used, by, some, orders, whose, nuns, receive, the, consecration, of, virgins, who, are, already, in, solemn, vows, or, who, are, being, consecrated, as, a, virgin, in, the, same, ceremony, references, to, consecrated, nuns, in, medieval, literature, refers, to, solemnly, professed, nuns, who, received, the, consecration, of, virgins, from, their, bishops, usually, some, years, after, their, final, profession, of, vows, the, reintroduced, rite, of, the, consecration, of, virgins, for, women, living, in, the, world, provides, as, the, roman, ritual, since, the, reintroduction, of, the, rite, of, consecration, of, virgins, for, women, living, in, the, world, in, 1971, the, newly, consecrated, virgin, receives, a, veil, as, a, sign, of, her, consecration, as, in, ancient, times, the, nuptial, symbolism, of, the, rite, was, displayed, particularly, in, the, bestowal, of, the, veil, on, the, virgin, by, the, bishop, as, can, be, found, in, the, writings, of, ambrose, of, milan, and, in, the, oldest, liturgical, sources, after, the, promulgation, of, pope, paul, vi, s, decree, perfectae, caritatis, on, the, adaption, and, renewal, of, religious, life, most, monastic, orders, for, nuns, retained, the, veil, regarding, other, institutes, of, religious, sisters, who, work, as, teachers, nurses, or, in, other, active, apostolates, some, wear, the, veil, while, some, others, have, abolished, the, use, of, the, veil, the, fullest, versions, of, the, nun, s, veil, cover, the, top, of, the, head, and, flow, down, around, and, over, the, shoulders, in, western, christianity, it, does, not, wrap, around, the, neck, or, face, in, those, orders, that, retain, one, the, starched, white, covering, about, the, face, neck, and, shoulders, is, known, as, a, wimple, and, is, a,

wedding, ceremony, either, the, bride, s, father, lifts, the, veil, presenting, the, bride, to, the, groom, who, then, kisses, her, or, the, new, groom, lifts, her, face, veil, in, order, to, kiss, her, some, see, the, lifting, of, the, veil, as, symbolically, consummating, the, marriage, representing, another, thin, membrane, the, hymen, that, will, be, physically, penetrated, on, the, wedding, night, in, orthodox, judaism, as, well, as, among, christians, in, certain, parts, of, the, world, such, as, eastern, europe, women, will, then, wear, a, headcovering, in, public, after, being, married, as, well, as, while, worshipping, in, scandinavia, the, bridal, veil, is, usually, worn, under, a, traditional, crown, and, does, not, cover, the, bride, s, face, instead, the, veil, is,

wedding, ceremony, dates, back, to, biblical, times, according, to, the, torah, in, genesis, 24, 65, isaac, is, brought, rebekah, to, marry, by, his, father, abraham, s, servant, and, rebekah, took, her, veil, and, covered, herself, when, isaac, was, approaching, in, a, traditional, jewish, wedding, just, before, the, ceremony, the, badeken, takes, place, at, which, the, groom, places, the, veil, over, the, bride, s, face, and, either, he, or, the, officiating, rabbi, gives, her, a, blessing, the, veil, stays, on, her, face, until, just, before, the, end, of, the, wedding, ceremony, when, they, are, legally, married, according, to, jewish, law, then, the, groom, helps, lift, the, veil, off, her, face, the, most, often, cited, interpretation, for, the, badeken, is, that, according, to, genesis, 29, when, jacob, went, to, marry, rachel, his, father, in, law, laban, tricked, him, into, marrying, leah, rachel, s, older, and, homelier, sister, many, say, that, the, veiling, ceremony, takes, place, to, make, sure, that, the, groom, is, marrying, the, right, bride, some, say, that, as, the, groom, places, the, veil, over, his, bride, he, makes, an, implicit, promise, to, clothe, and, protect, her, finally, by, covering, her, face, the, groom, recognizes, that, he, is, marrying, the, bride, for, her, inner, beauty, while, looks, will, fade, with, time, his, love, will, be, everlasting, in, some, ultra, orthodox, communities, it, is, a, custom, for, the, bride, to, wear, an, opaque, veil, as, she, is, escorted, to, the, groom, this, is, said, to, show, her, complete, willingness, to, enter, into, the, marriage, and, her, absolute, trust, that, she, is, marrying, the, right, man, in, ancient, judaism, the, lifting, of, the, veil, took, place, just, prior, to, the, consummation, of, the, marriage, in, sexual, union, the, uncovering, or, unveiling, that, takes, place, in, the, wedding, ceremony, is, a, symbol, of, what, will, take, place, in, the, marriage, bed, just, as, the, two, become, one, through, their, words, spoken, in, wedding, vows, so, these, words, are, a, sign, of, the, physical, oneness, that, they, will, consummate, later, on, the, lifting, of, the, veil, is, a, symbol, and, anticipation, of, this, in, christian, theology, st, paul, s, words, concerning, how, marriage, symbolizes, the, union, of, christ, and, his, church, underlie, part, of, the, tradition, of, veiling, in, the, marriage, ceremony, in, historic, christian, traditions, the, veil, is, seen, as, a, visible, sign, that, the, woman, is, under, the, authority, of, a, man, and, that, she, is, submitting, herself, to, her, husband, s, christ, like, leadership, and, loving, care, as, such, the, practice, of, the, wedding, veil, is, part, of, the, wider, ordinance, of, the, woman, s, headcovering, in, christianity, rooted, in, 1, corinthians, 11, 1, 13, the, removing, of, the, veil, can, be, seen, as, a, symbol, of, the, temple, veil, that, was, torn, when, christ, died, giving, believers, direct, access, to, god, and, in, the, same, way, the, bride, and, the, groom, once, married, now, have, full, access, to, one, another, in, 2019, a, letter, by, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, president, russell, m, nelson, and, his, counselors, dallin, h, oaks, and, henry, b, eyring, declared, that, veiling, the, faces, of, deceased, endowed, women, prior, to, burial, is, optional, previously, it, had, been, required, the, letter, went, on, to, say, that, such, veiling, may, be, done, if, the, sister, expressed, such, a, desire, while, she, was, living, in, cases, where, the, wishes, of, the, deceased, sister, on, this, matter, are, not, known, her, family, should, be, consulted, that, same, year, veiling, of, women, during, part, of, the, temple, endowment, ceremony, was, also, made, optional, where, it, had, been, required, before, veils, remained, a, part, of, western, mourning, dress, customs, into, the, early, 20th, century, the, tradition, of, widow, s, veiling, has, its, roots, in, the, attire, of, a, christian, nun, which, symbolized, modesty, and, chastity, and, the, mourning, veil, became, a, way, to, demonstrate, sincerity, and, piety, the, mourning, veil, was, commonly, seen, as, a, means, of, shielding, the, mourner, and, hiding, her, grief, and, on, the, contrary, seen, by, some, women, as, a, means, of, publicly, expressing, their, emotions, widows, in, the, victorian, era, were, expected, to, wear, mourning, veils, for, at, least, three, months, and, up, to, two, and, a, half, years,

it, is, intended, to, honor, a, person, object, or, space, the, actual, sociocultural, psychological, and, sociosexual, functions, of, veils, have, not, been, studied, extensively, but, most, likely, include, the, maintenance, of, social, distance, and, the, communication, of, social, status, and, cultural, identity, a, veil, also, has, symbolic, interpretations, as, something, partially,
