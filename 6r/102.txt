fillings, as, a, replacement, for, butter, it, provides, flakiness, to, pastry, in, western, cuisine, it, has, ceded, its, popularity, to, vegetable, oils, but, many, cooks, and, bakers, still, favor, it, over, other, fats, for, certain, uses, lard, has, always, been, an, important, cooking, and, baking, staple, in, cultures, where, pork, is, an, important, dietary, item, with, pig, fat, often, being, as, valuable, a, product, as, pork, during, the, 19th, century, lard, was, used, in, a, similar, way, to, butter, in, north, america, and, many, european, nations, lard, remained, about, as, popular, as, butter, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, was, widely, used, as, a, substitute, for, butter, during, world, war, ii, as, a, readily, available, by, product, of, modern, pork, production, lard, had, been, cheaper, than, most, vegetable, oils, and, it, was, common, in, many, people, s, diet, until, the, industrial, revolution, made, vegetable, oils, more, common, and, more, affordable, vegetable, shortenings, were, developed, in, the, early, 1900s, which, made, it, possible, to, use, vegetable, based, fats, in, baking, and, in, other, uses, where, solid, fats, were, called, for, upton, sinclair, s, novel, the, jungle, though, fictional, portrayed, men, falling, into, rendering, vats, and, being, sold, as, lard, which, generated, negative, publicity, by, the, late, 20th, century, lard, began, to, be, considered, less, healthy, than, vegetable, oils, such, as, olive, and, sunflower, oil, because, of, its, high, content, of, saturated, fatty, acids, and, cholesterol, however, despite, its, reputation, lard, has, less, saturated, fat, more, unsaturated, fat, and, less, cholesterol, than, an, equal, amount, of, butter, by, weight, un, hydrogenated, lard, contains, no, transfats, it, has, also, been, regarded, as, a, poverty, food, in, the, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, however, chefs, and, bakers, rediscovered, lard, s, unique, culinary, values, leading, to, a, partial, rehabilitation, of, this, fat, among, foodies, negative, publicity, about, the, transfat, content, of, the, partially, hydrogenated, vegetable, oils, in, vegetable,

germany, brazil, united, states, and, russia, lard, can, be, obtained, from, any, part, of, the, pig, that, has, a, high, concentration, of, fatty, tissue, the, highest, grade, of, lard, known, as, leaf, lard, is, obtained, from, the, flare, visceral, fat, deposit, surrounding, the, kidneys, and, inside, the, loin, leaf, lard, has, little, pork, flavor, making, it, ideal, for, use, in, baked, goods, where, it, is, valued, for, its, ability, to, produce, flaky, moist, pie, crusts, the, next, highest, grade, is, obtained, from, fatback, the, hard, subcutaneous, fat, between, the, pig, s, back, skin, and, muscle, the, lowest, grade, for, purposes, of, rendering, into, lard, is, obtained, from, the, soft, caul, fat, surrounding, digestive, organs, such, as, small, intestines, though, caul, fat, is, often, used, directly, as, a, wrapping, for, roasting, lean, meats, or, in, the, manufacture, of, p, t, s, lard, may, be, rendered, by, two, processes, wet, or, dry, in, wet, rendering, pig, fat, is, boiled, in, water, or, steamed, at, a, high, temperature, and, the, lard, which, is, insoluble, in, water, is, skimmed, from, the, surface, of, the, mixture, or, separated, in, an, industrial, centrifuge, in, dry, rendering, the, fat, is, exposed, to, high, heat, in, a, pan, or, oven, without, water, a, process, similar, to, frying, bacon, the, two, processes, yield, somewhat, differing, products, wet, rendered, lard, has, a, more, neutral, flavor, a, lighter, color, and, a, high, smoke, point, dry, rendered, lard, is, somewhat, browner, and, has, a, caramelized, flavor, and, has, a, lower, smoke, point, industrially, produced, lard, including, much, of, the, lard, sold, in, supermarkets, is, rendered, from, a, mixture, of, high, and, low, quality, fat, from, throughout, the, pig, lard, is, often, hydrogenated, to, improve, its, stability, at, room, temperature, hydrogenated, lard, sold, to, consumers, typically, contains, fewer, than, 0, 5, g, of, transfats, per, 13, g, serving, lard, is, also, often, treated, with, bleaching, and, deodorizing, agents, emulsifiers, and, antioxidants, such, as, bht, these, treatments, make, it, more, consistent, and, prevent, spoilage, untreated, lard, must, be, refrigerated, or, frozen, to, prevent, rancidity, consumers, wanting, a, higher, quality, source, of, lard, typically, seek, out, artisanal, producers, or, render, it, themselves, from, leaf, lard, or, fatback, a, by, product, of, dry, rendering, lard, is, deep, fried, meat, skin, and, membrane, tissue, known, as, cracklings, lard, consists, mainly, of, fats, which, in, the, context, of, chemistry, are, known, as, triglycerides, triglycerides, contain, three, fatty, acids, varying, from, one, triglyceride, to, another, in, general, lard, is, similar, to, tallow, in, its, composition, about, 20, of, lard, is, the, achiral, triglyceride, with, palmitic, acid, on, carbon, 2, and, oleic, acid, on, carbons, 1, and, 3, pigs, that, have, been, fed, different, diets, will, have, lard, with, a, significantly, different, fatty, acid, content, and, iodine, value, peanut, fed, hogs, or, the, acorn, fed, pigs, raised, for, jam, n, ib, rico, therefore, produce, a, somewhat, different, kind, of, lard, compared, to, pigs, raised, in, north, american, farms, that, are, fed, corn, lard, is, one, of, the, few, edible, oils, with, a, relatively, high, smoke, point, attributable, to, its, high, saturated, fatty, acids, content, pure, lard, is, especially, useful, for, cooking, since, it, produces, little, smoke, when, heated, and, has, a, distinct, flavor, when, combined, with, other, foods, many, chefs, and, bakers, prize, lard, over, other, types, of, shortening, because, of, its, flavor, and, range, of, applications, because, of, the, relatively, large, fat, crystals, in, lard, it, is, extremely, effective, as, a, shortening, in, baking, pie, crusts, made, with, lard, tend, to, be, flakier, than, those, made, with, butter, many, cooks, employ, both, types, of, fat, in, their, pastries, to, combine, the, shortening, properties, of, lard, with, the, flavor, of, butter, lard, was, once, widely, used, in, the, cuisines, of, europe, china, and, the, new, world, and, still, plays, a, significant, role, in, british, central, european, mexican, and, chinese, cuisines, in, british, cuisine, lard, is, a,

very, common, in, europe, and, north, america, especially, those, areas, where, dairy, fats, and, vegetable, oils, were, rare, as, the, demand, for, lard, grows, in, the, high, end, restaurant, industry, small, farmers, have, begun, to, specialize, in, heritage, hog, breeds, with, higher, body, fat, contents, than, the, leaner, modern, hog, breeds, such, as, the, mangalitsa, hog, of, hungary, or, large, black, pig, of, great, britain, are, experiencing, an, enormous, resurgence, to, the, point, that, breeders, are, unable, to, keep, up, with, demand, when, used, without,

paprika, and, eaten, as, a, side, dish, with, beer, all, of, these, are, commonly, translated, on, menus, as, lard, sandwiches, perhaps, due, to, the, lack, of, familiarity, of, most, contemporary, english, native, speakers, with, dripping, attempts, to, use, hungarian, zs, r, or, polish, smalec, both, meaning, fat, lard, when, british, recipes, calling, for, lard, will, reveal, the, difference,
