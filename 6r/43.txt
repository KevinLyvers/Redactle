the, modern, definition, was, first, recorded, in, 1829, the, word, luncheon, l, n, t, n, has, a, similarly, uncertain, origin, according, to, the, oed, being, related, in, some, way, to, lunch, it, is, possible, that, luncheon, is, an, extension, of, lunch, as, with, punch, to, puncheon, and, trunch, to, truncheon, originally, interchangeable, with, lunch, it, is, now, used, in, especially, formal, circumstances, the, oxford, companion, to, food, claims, that, luncheon, is, a, northern, england, english, word, that, is, derived, from, the, old, english, word, nuncheon, or, nunchin,
