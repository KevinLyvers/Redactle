in, social, psychology, an, interpersonal, relation, or, interpersonal, relationship, describes, a, social, association, connection, or, affiliation, between, two, or, more, persons, it, overlaps, significantly, with, the, concept, of, social, relations, which, are, the, fundamental, unit, of, analysis, within, the, social, sciences, relations, vary, in, degrees, of, intimacy, self, disclosure, duration, reciprocity, and, power, distribution, the, main, themes, or, trends, of, the, interpersonal, relations, are, family, kinship, friendship, love, marriage, business, employment, clubs, neighborhoods, ethical, values, support, and, solidarity, interpersonal, relations, may, be, regulated, by, law, custom, or, mutual, agreement, and, form, the, basis, of, social, groups, and, societies, they, appear, when, people, communicate, or, act, with, each, other, within, specific, social, contexts, and, they, thrive, on, equitable, and, reciprocal, compromises, interdisciplinary, analysis, of, relationships, draws, heavily, upon, the, other, social, sciences, including, but, not, limited, to, anthropology, linguistics, sociology, economics, political, science, communication, mathematics, social, work, and, cultural, studies, this, scientific, analysis, had, evolved, during, the, 1990s, and, has, become, relationship, science, through, the, research, done, by, ellen, berscheid, and, elaine, hatfield, this, interdisciplinary, science, attempts, to, provide, evidence, based, conclusions, through, the, use, of, data, analysis, romantic, relationships, have, been, defined, in, countless, ways, by, writers, philosophers, religions, scientists, and, in, the, modern, day, relationship, counselors, two, popular, definitions, of, love, are, sternberg, s, triangular, theory, of, love, and, fisher, s, theory, of, love, sternberg, defines, love, in, terms, of, intimacy, passion, and, commitment, which, he, claims, exist, in, varying, levels, in, different, romantic, relationships, fisher, defines, love, as, composed, of, three, stages, attraction, romantic, love, and, attachment, romantic, relationships, may, exist, between, two, people, of, any, gender, or, among, a, group, of, people, as, in, polyamory, on, the, basis, of, openness, all, romantic, relationships, are, of, 2, types, open, and, closed, closed, relationships, are, strictly, against, romantic, or, sexual, activity, of, partners, with, anyone, else, outside, the, relationships, in, an, open, relationship, all, partners, remain, committed, to, each, other, but, allow, themselves, and, their, partner, to, have, relationships, with, others, on, the, basis, of, number, of, partners, they, are, of, 2, types, monoamorous, and, polyamorous, a, monoamorous, relationship, is, between, only, two, individuals, a, polyamorous, relationship, is, among, three, or, more, individuals, while, many, individuals, recognize, the, single, defining, quality, of, a, romantic, relationship, as, the, presence, of, love, it, is, impossible, for, romantic, relationships, to, survive, without, the, component, of, interpersonal, communication, within, romantic, relationships, love, is, therefore, equally, difficult, to, define, hazan, and, shaver, define, love, using, ainsworth, s, attachment, theory, as, comprising, proximity, emotional, support, self, exploration, and, separation, distress, when, parted, from, the, loved, one, other, components, commonly, agreed, to, be, necessary, for, love, are, physical, attraction, similarity, reciprocity, and, self, disclosure, early, adolescent, relationships, are, characterized, by, companionship, reciprocity, and, sexual, experiences, as, emerging, adults, mature, they, begin, to, develop, attachment, and, caring, qualities, in, their, relationships, including, love, bonding, security, and, support, for, partners, earlier, relationships, also, tend, to, be, shorter, and, exhibit, greater, involvement, with, social, networks, later, relationships, are, often, marked, by, shrinking, social, networks, as, the, couple, dedicates, more, time, to, each, other, than, to, associates, later, relationships, also, tend, to, exhibit, higher, levels, of, commitment, most, psychologists, and, relationship, counselors, predict, a, decline, of, intimacy, and, passion, over, time, replaced, by, a, greater, emphasis, on, companionate, love, differing, from, adolescent, companionate, love, in, the, caring, committed, and, partner, focused, qualities, however, couple, studies, have, found, no, decline, in, intimacy, nor, in, the, importance, of, sex, intimacy, and, passionate, love, to, those, in, longer, or, later, life, relationships, older, people, tend, to, be, more, satisfied, in, their, relationships, but, face, greater, barriers, to, entering, new, relationships, than, do, younger, or, middle, aged, people, older, women, in, particular, face, social, demographic, and, personal, barriers, men, aged, 65, and, older, are, nearly, twice, as, likely, as, women, to, be, married, and, widowers, are, nearly, three, times, as, likely, to, be, dating, 18, months, following, their, partner, s, loss, compared, to, widows, the, term, significant, other, gained, popularity, during, the, 1990s, reflecting, the, growing, acceptance, of, non, heteronormative, relationships, it, can, be, used, to, avoid, making, an, assumption, about, the, gender, or, relational, status, e, g, married, cohabitating, civil, union, of, a, person, s, intimate, partner, cohabiting, relationships, continue, to, rise, with, many, partners, considering, cohabitation, to, be, nearly, as, serious, as, or, a, substitute, for, marriage, in, particular, lgbtq, people, often, face, unique, challenges, in, establishing, and, maintaining, intimate, relationships, the, strain, of, internalized, discrimination, socially, ingrained, or, homophobia, transphobia, and, other, forms, of, discrimination, against, lgbtq, people, and, social, pressure, of, presenting, themselves, in, line, with, socially, acceptable, gender, norms, can, affect, their, health, quality, of, life, satisfaction, emotions, etc, inside, and, outside, their, relationships, lgbtq, youth, also, lack, the, social, support, and, peer, connections, enjoyed, by, hetero, normative, young, people, nonetheless, comparative, studies, of, homosexual, and, heterosexual, couples, have, found, few, differences, in, relationship, intensity, quality, satisfaction, or, commitment, although, nontraditional, relationships, continue, to, rise, marriage, still, makes, up, the, majority, of, relationships, except, among, emerging, adults, it, is, also, still, considered, by, many, to, occupy, a, place, of, greater, importance, among, family, and, social, structures, in, ancient, times, parent, child, relationships, were, often, marked, by, fear, either, of, rebellion, or, abandonment, resulting, in, the, strict, filial, roles, in, for, example, ancient, rome, and, china, freud, conceived, of, the, oedipal, complex, the, supposed, obsession, that, young, boys, have, towards, their, mothers, and, the, accompanying, fear, and, rivalry, with, their, fathers, and, the, electra, complex, in, which, the, young, girl, feels, that, her, mother, has, castrated, her, and, therefore, becomes, obsessed, with, her, father, freud, s, ideas, influenced, thought, on, parent, child, relationships, for, decades, another, early, conception, of, parent, child, relationships, was, that, love, only, existed, as, a, biological, drive, for, survival, and, comfort, on, the, child, s, part, in, 1958, however, harry, harlow, s, study, the, hot, wire, mother, comparing, rhesus, reactions, to, wire, surrogate, mothers, and, cloth, mothers, demonstrated, that, affection, was, wanted, by, any, caregiver, and, not, only, the, surrogate, mothers, the, study, laid, the, groundwork, for, mary, ainsworth, s, attachment, theory, showing, how, the, infants, used, their, cloth, mothers, as, a, secure, base, from, which, to, explore, in, a, series, of, studies, using, the, strange, situation, a, scenario, in, which, an, infant, is, separated, from, then, reunited, with, the, parent, ainsworth, defined, three, styles, of, parent, child, relationship, secure, attachments, are, linked, to, better, social, and, academic, outcomes, and, greater, moral, internalization, as, research, proposes, the, idea, that, parent, child, relationships, play, a, key, role, in, the, developing, morality, of, young, children, secure, attachments, are, also, linked, to, less, delinquency, for, children, and, have, been, found, to, predict, later, relationship, success, for, most, of, the, late, nineteenth, through, the, twentieth, century, the, perception, of, adolescent, parent, relationships, was, that, of, a, time, of, upheaval, g, stanley, hall, popularized, the, sturm, und, drang, or, storm, and, stress, model, of, adolescence, psychological, research, has, painted, a, much, tamer, picture, although, adolescents, are, more, risk, seeking, and, emerging, adults, have, higher, suicide, rates, they, are, largely, less, volatile, and, have, much, better, relationships, with, their, parents, than, the, storm, and, stress, model, would, suggest, early, adolescence, often, marks, a, decline, in, parent, child, relationship, quality, which, then, re, stabilizes, through, adolescence, and, relationships, are, sometimes, better, in, late, adolescence, than, prior, to, its, onset, with, the, increasing, average, age, at, marriage, and, more, youths, attending, college, and, living, with, parents, past, their, teens, the, concept, of, a, new, period, called, emerging, adulthood, gained, popularity, this, is, considered, a, period, of, uncertainty, and, experimentation, between, adolescence, and, adulthood, during, this, stage, interpersonal, relationships, are, considered, to, be, more, self, focused, and, relationships, with, parents, may, still, be, influential, sibling, relationships, have, a, profound, effect, on, social, psychological, emotional, and, academic, outcomes, although, proximity, and, contact, usually, decreases, over, time, sibling, bonds, continue, to, have, effect, throughout, their, lives, sibling, bonds, are, one, of, few, enduring, relationships, humans, may, experience, sibling, relationships, are, affected, by, parent, child, relationships, such, that, sibling, relationships, in, childhood, often, reflect, the, positive, or, negative, aspects, of, children, s, relationships, with, their, parents, business, is, generally, held, to, be, distinct, from, personal, relations, a, contrasting, mode, which, other, than, excursions, from, the, norm, is, based, on, non, personal, interest, and, rational, rather, than, emotional, concerns, proximity, proximity, increases, the, chance, of, repeated, exposure, to, the, same, person, long, term, exposure, that, can, develop, familiarity, is, more, likely, to, trigger, like, or, hate, technological, advance, the, internet, removes, the, problem, of, lack, of, communication, due, to, long, distance, people, can, communicate, with, others, who, live, far, away, from, them, through, video, calls, or, text, internet, is, a, medium, for, people, to, be, close, to, others, who, are, not, physically, near, them, similarity, people, prefer, to, make, friends, with, others, who, are, similar, to, them, because, their, thoughts, and, feelings, are, more, likely, to, be, understood, interpersonal, relationships, are, dynamic, systems, that, change, continuously, during, their, existence, like, living, organisms, relationships, have, a, beginning, a, lifespan, and, an, end, they, tend, to, grow, and, improve, gradually, as, people, get, to, know, each, other, and, become, closer, emotionally, or, they, gradually, deteriorate, as, people, drift, apart, move, on, with, their, lives, and, form, new, relationships, with, others, one, of, the, most, influential, models, of, relationship, development, was, proposed, by, psychologist, george, levinger, this, model, was, formulated, to, describe, heterosexual, adult, romantic, relationships, but, it, has, been, applied, to, other, kinds, of, interpersonal, relations, as, well, according, to, the, model, the, natural, development, of, a, relationship, follows, five, stages, according, to, the, latest, systematic, review, of, the, economic, literature, on, the, factors, associated, with, life, satisfaction, dating, from, 2007, stable, and, secure, relationships, are, beneficial, and, correspondingly, relationship, dissolution, is, harmful, the, american, psychological, association, has, summarized, the, evidence, on, breakups, breaking, up, can, actually, be, a, positive, experience, when, the, relationship, did, not, expand, the, self, and, when, the, breakup, leads, to, personal, growth, they, also, recommend, some, ways, to, cope, with, the, experience, less, time, between, a, breakup, and, a, subsequent, relationship, predicts, higher, self, esteem, attachment, security, emotional, stability, respect, for, your, new, partner, and, greater, well, being, furthermore, rebound, relationships, do, not, last, any, shorter, than, regular, relationships, 60, of, people, are, friends, with, one, or, more, ex, 60, of, people, have, had, an, off, and, on, relationship, 37, of, cohabiting, couples, and, 23, of, the, married, have, broken, up, and, gotten, back, together, with, their, existing, partner, terminating, a, marital, relationship, implies, divorce, or, annulment, one, reason, cited, for, divorce, is, infidelity, the, determinants, of, unfaithfulness, are, debated, by, dating, service, providers, feminists, academics, and, science, communicators, according, to, psychology, today, women, s, rather, than, men, s, level, of, commitment, more, strongly, determines, if, a, relationship, will, continue, research, conducted, in, iran, and, other, countries, has, shown, that, conflicts, are, common, between, couples, and, in, iran, 92, of, the, respondents, reported, that, they, had, conflicts, in, their, marriages, these, conflicts, can, cause, major, problems, for, couples, and, they, are, caused, due, to, multiple, reasons, abusive, relationships, involve, either, maltreatment, or, violence, such, as, physical, abuse, physical, neglect, sexual, abuse, and, emotional, maltreatment, abusive, relationships, within, the, family, are, very, prevalent, in, the, united, states, and, usually, involve, women, or, children, as, victims, common, individual, factors, for, abusers, include, low, self, esteem, poor, impulse, control, external, locus, of, control, drug, use, alcohol, abuse, and, negative, affectivity, there, are, also, external, factors, such, as, stress, poverty, and, loss, which, contribute, to, likelihood, of, abuse, codependency, initially, focused, on, a, codependent, partner, enabling, substance, abuse, but, it, has, become, more, broadly, defined, to, describe, a, dysfunctional, relationship, with, extreme, dependence, on, or, preoccupation, with, another, person, there, are, some, who, even, refer, to, codependency, as, an, addiction, to, the, relationship, the, focus, of, codependents, tends, to, be, on, the, emotional, state, behavioral, choices, thoughts, and, beliefs, of, another, person, often, those, who, are, codependent, neglect, themselves, in, favor, of, taking, care, of, others, and, have, difficulty, fully, developing, an, identity, of, their, own, narcissists, focus, on, themselves, and, often, distance, themselves, from, intimate, relationships, the, focus, of, narcissistic, interpersonal, relationships, is, to, promote, one, s, self, concept, generally, narcissists, show, less, empathy, in, relationships, and, view, love, pragmatically, or, as, a, game, involving, others, emotions, narcissists, are, usually, part, of, the, personality, disorder, narcissistic, personality, disorder, npd, in, relationships, they, tend, to, affect, the, other, person, as, they, attempt, to, use, them, to, enhance, their, self, esteem, specific, types, of, npd, make, a, person, incapable, of, having, an, interpersonal, relationship, due, to, their, being, cunning, envious, and, contemptuous, human, beings, are, innately, social, and, are, shaped, by, their, experiences, with, others, there, are, multiple, perspectives, to, understand, this, inherent, motivation, to, interact, with, others, according, to, maslow, s, hierarchy, of, needs, humans, need, to, feel, love, sexual, nonsexual, and, acceptance, from, social, groups, family, peer, groups, in, fact, the, need, to, belong, is, so, innately, ingrained, that, it, may, be, strong, enough, to, overcome, physiological, and, safety, needs, such, as, children, s, attachment, to, abusive, parents, or, staying, in, abusive, romantic, relationships, such, examples, illustrate, the, extent, to, which, the, psychobiological, drive, to, belong, is, entrenched, another, way, to, appreciate, the, importance, of, relationships, is, in, terms, of, a, reward, framework, this, perspective, suggests, that, individuals, engage, in, relations, that, are, rewarding, in, both, tangible, and, intangible, ways, the, concept, fits, into, a, larger, theory, of, social, exchange, this, theory, is, based, on, the, idea, that, relationships, develop, as, a, result, of, cost, benefit, analysis, individuals, seek, out, rewards, in, interactions, with, others, and, are, willing, to, pay, a, cost, for, said, rewards, in, the, best, case, scenario, rewards, will, exceed, costs, producing, a, net, gain, this, can, lead, to, shopping, around, or, constantly, comparing, alternatives, to, maximize, the, benefits, or, rewards, while, minimizing, costs, relationships, are, also, important, for, their, ability, to, help, individuals, develop, a, sense, of, self, the, relational, self, is, the, part, of, an, individual, s, self, concept, that, consists, of, the, feelings, and, beliefs, that, one, has, regarding, oneself, that, develops, based, on, interactions, with, others, in, other, words, one, s, emotions, and, behaviors, are, shaped, by, prior, relationships, relational, self, theory, posits, that, prior, and, existing, relationships, influence, one, s, emotions, and, behaviors, in, interactions, with, new, individuals, particularly, those, individuals, that, remind, them, of, others, in, their, life, studies, have, shown, that, exposure, to, someone, who, resembles, a, significant, other, activates, specific, self, beliefs, changing, how, one, thinks, about, oneself, in, the, moment, more, so, than, exposure, to, someone, who, does, not, resemble, one, s, significant, other, power, is, the, ability, to, influence, the, behavior, of, other, people, when, two, parties, have, or, assert, unequal, levels, of, power, one, is, termed, dominant, and, the, other, submissive, expressions, of, dominance, can, communicate, an, intention, to, assert, or, maintain, dominance, in, a, relationship, being, submissive, can, be, beneficial, because, it, saves, time, limits, emotional, stress, and, may, avoid, hostile, actions, such, as, withholding, of, resources, cessation, of, cooperation, termination, of, the, relationship, maintaining, a, grudge, or, even, physical, violence, submission, occurs, in, different, degrees, for, example, some, employees, may, follow, orders, without, question, whereas, others, might, express, disagreement, but, concede, when, pressed, groups, of, people, can, form, a, dominance, hierarchy, for, example, a, hierarchical, organization, uses, a, command, hierarchy, for, top, down, management, this, can, reduce, time, wasted, in, conflict, over, unimportant, decisions, prevents, inconsistent, decisions, from, harming, the, operations, of, the, organization, maintain, alignment, of, a, large, population, of, workers, with, the, goals, of, the, owners, which, the, workers, might, not, personally, share, and, if, promotion, is, based, on, merit, help, ensure, that, the, people, with, the, best, expertise, make, important, decisions, this, contrasts, with, group, decision, making, and, systems, which, encourage, decision, making, and, self, organization, by, front, line, employees, who, in, some, cases, may, have, better, information, about, customer, needs, or, how, to, work, efficiently, dominance, is, only, one, aspect, of, organizational, structure, a, power, structure, describes, power, and, dominance, relationships, in, a, larger, society, for, example, a, feudal, society, under, a, monarchy, exhibits, a, strong, dominance, hierarchy, in, both, economics, and, physical, power, whereas, dominance, relationships, in, a, society, with, democracy, and, capitalism, are, more, complicated, in, business, relationships, dominance, is, often, associated, with, economic, power, for, example, a, business, may, adopt, a, submissive, attitude, to, customer, preferences, stocking, what, customers, want, to, buy, and, complaints, the, customer, is, always, right, in, order, to, earn, more, money, a, firm, with, monopoly, power, may, be, less, responsive, to, customer, complaints, because, it, can, afford, to, adopt, a, dominant, position, in, a, business, partnership, a, silent, partner, is, one, who, adopts, a, submissive, position, in, all, aspects, but, retains, financial, ownership, and, a, share, of, the, profits, two, parties, can, be, dominant, in, different, areas, for, example, in, a, friendship, or, romantic, relationship, one, person, may, have, strong, opinions, about, where, to, eat, dinner, whereas, the, other, has, strong, opinions, about, how, to, decorate, a, shared, space, it, could, be, beneficial, for, the, party, with, weak, preferences, to, be, submissive, in, that, area, because, it, will, not, make, them, unhappy, and, avoids, conflict, with, the, party, that, would, be, unhappy, the, breadwinner, model, is, associated, with, gender, role, assignments, where, the, male, in, a, heterosexual, marriage, would, be, dominant, as, they, are, responsible, for, economic, provision, social, exchange, theory, and, rusbult, s, investment, model, show, that, relationship, satisfaction, is, based, on, three, factors, rewards, costs, and, comparison, levels, miller, 2012, rewards, refer, to, any, aspects, of, the, partner, or, relationship, that, are, positive, conversely, costs, are, the, negative, or, unpleasant, aspects, of, the, partner, or, their, relationship, the, comparison, level, includes, what, each, partner, expects, of, the, relationship, the, comparison, level, is, influenced, by, past, relationships, and, general, relationship, expectations, they, are, taught, by, family, and, friends, individuals, in, long, distance, relationships, ldrs, rated, their, relationships, as, more, satisfying, than, individuals, in, proximal, relationship, prs, alternatively, holt, and, stone, 1988, found, that, long, distance, couples, who, were, able, to, meet, with, their, partner, at, least, once, a, month, had, similar, satisfaction, levels, to, unmarried, couples, who, cohabitated, also, the, relationship, satisfaction, was, lower, for, members, of, ldrs, who, saw, their, partner, less, frequently, than, once, a, month, ldr, couples, reported, the, same, level, of, relationship, satisfaction, as, couples, in, prs, despite, only, seeing, each, other, on, average, once, every, 23, days, social, exchange, theory, and, the, am, investment, model, both, theorize, that, relationships, that, are, high, in, cost, would, be, less, satisfying, than, relationships, that, are, low, in, cost, ldrs, have, a, higher, level, of, costs, than, prs, therefore, one, would, assume, that, ldrs, are, less, satisfying, than, prs, individuals, in, ldrs, are, more, satisfied, with, their, relationships, compared, to, individuals, in, prs, this, can, be, explained, by, unique, aspects, of, the, ldrs, how, the, individuals, use, relationship, maintenance, behaviors, and, the, attachment, styles, of, the, individuals, in, the, relationships, therefore, the, costs, and, benefits, of, the, relationship, are, subjective, to, the, individual, and, people, in, ldrs, tend, to, report, lower, costs, and, higher, rewards, in, their, relationship, compared, to, prs, confucianism, is, a, study, and, theory, of, relationships, especially, within, hierarchies, social, harmony, the, central, goal, of, confucianism, results, in, part, from, every, individual, knowing, their, place, in, the, social, order, and, playing, their, part, well, particular, duties, arise, from, each, person, s, particular, situation, in, relation, to, others, the, individual, stands, simultaneously, in, several, different, relationships, with, different, people, as, a, junior, in, relation, to, parents, and, elders, and, as, a, senior, in, relation, to, younger, siblings, students, and, others, juniors, are, considered, in, confucianism, to, owe, their, seniors, reverence, and, seniors, have, duties, of, benevolence, and, concern, toward, juniors, a, focus, on, mutuality, is, prevalent, in, east, asian, cultures, to, this, day, the, mindfulness, theory, of, relationships, shows, how, closeness, in, relationships, may, be, enhanced, minding, is, the, reciprocal, knowing, process, involving, the, nonstop, interrelated, thoughts, feelings, and, behaviors, of, persons, in, a, relationship, five, components, of, minding, include, popular, perceptions, of, intimate, relationships, are, strongly, influenced, by, movies, and, television, common, messages, are, that, love, is, predestined, love, at, first, sight, is, possible, and, that, love, with, the, right, person, always, succeeds, those, who, consume, the, most, romance, related, media, tend, to, believe, in, predestined, romance, and, that, those, who, are, destined, to, be, together, implicitly, understand, each, other, these, beliefs, however, can, lead, to, less, communication, and, problem, solving, as, well, as, giving, up, on, relationships, more, easily, when, conflict, is, encountered, social, media, has, changed, the, face, of, interpersonal, relationships, romantic, interpersonal, relationships, are, no, less, impacted, for, example, in, the, united, states, facebook, has, become, an, integral, part, of, the, dating, process, for, emerging, adults, social, media, can, have, both, positive, and, negative, impacts, on, romantic, relationships, for, example, supportive, social, networks, have, been, linked, to, more, stable, relationships, however, social, media, usage, can, also, facilitate, conflict, jealousy, and, passive, aggressive, behaviors, such, as, spying, on, a, partner, aside, from, direct, effects, on, the, development, maintenance, and, perception, of, romantic, relationships, excessive, social, network, usage, is, linked, to, jealousy, and, dissatisfaction, in, relationships, a, growing, segment, of, the, population, is, engaging, in, purely, online, dating, sometimes, but, not, always, moving, towards, traditional, face, to, face, interactions, these, online, relationships, differ, from, face, to, face, relationships, for, example, self, disclosure, may, be, of, primary, importance, in, developing, an, online, relationship, conflict, management, differs, since, avoidance, is, easier, and, conflict, resolution, skills, may, not, develop, in, the, same, way, additionally, the, definition, of, infidelity, is, both, broadened, and, narrowed, since, physical, infidelity, becomes, easier, to, conceal, but, emotional, infidelity, e, g, chatting, with, more, than, one, online, partner, becomes, a, more, serious, offense
