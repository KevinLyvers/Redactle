in, the, female, s, reproductive, cycle, which, increases, the, chances, of, successful, impregnation, however, bonobos, dolphins, and, chimpanzees, are, known, to, engage, in, sexual, intercourse,

activity, that, does, not, involve, penile, vaginal, sex, or, other, sexual, penetration, might, be, used, to, retain, virginity, sometimes, called, technical, virginity, or, labeled, outercourse, one, reason, virginity, loss, is, often, based, on, penile, vaginal, intercourse, is, because, heterosexual, couples, may, engage, in, anal, or, oral, sex, as, a, way, of, being, sexually, active, while, maintaining, that, they, are, virgins, since, they, have, not, engaged, in, the, reproductive, act, of, coitus, some, gay, men, consider, frot, or, oral, sex, as, a, way, of, maintaining, their, virginities, with, penile, anal, penetration, used, as, sexual, intercourse, and, for, virginity, loss, while, other, gay, men, may, consider, frot, or, oral, sex, as, their, main, forms, of, sexual, activity, lesbians, may, categorize, oral, sex, or, fingering, as, sexual, intercourse, and, subsequently, an, act, of, virginity, loss, or, tribadism, as, a, primary, form, of, sexual, activity, researchers, commonly, use, sexual, intercourse, to, denote, penile, vaginal, intercourse, while, using, specific, words, such, as, anal, sex, or, oral, sex, for, other, sexual, behaviors, scholars, richard, m, lerner, and, laurence, steinberg, state, that, researchers, also, rarely, disclose, how, they, conceptualize, sex, or, even, whether, they, resolved, potential, discrepancies, in, conceptualizations, of, sex, lerner, and, steinberg, attribute, researchers, focus, on, penile, vaginal, sex, to, the, larger, culture, s, preoccupation, with, this, form, of, sexual, activity, and, have, expressed, concern, that, the, widespread, unquestioned, equation, of, penile, vaginal, intercourse, with, sex, reflects, a, failure, to, examine, systematically, whether, the, respondent, s, understanding, of, the, question, matches, what, the, researcher, had, in, mind, this, focus, can, also, relegate, other, forms, of, mutual, sexual, activity, to, foreplay, or, contribute, to, them, not, being, regarded, as, real, sex, and, limits, the, meaning, of, rape, it, may, also, be, that, conceptually, conflating, sexual, activity, with, vaginal, intercourse, and, sexual, function, hinders, and, limits, information, about, sexual, behavior, that, non, heterosexual, people, may, be, engaging, in, or, information, about, heterosexuals, who, may, be, engaging, in, non, vaginal, sexual, activity, studies, regarding, the, meaning, of, sexual, intercourse, sometimes, come, into, conflict, while, most, consider, penile, vaginal, intercourse, to, be, sex, whether, anal, or, oral, intercourse, are, considered, sex, is, more, debatable, with, oral, sex, ranking, lowest, the, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, stated, that, although, there, are, only, limited, national, data, about, how, often, adolescents, engage, in, oral, sex, some, data, suggest, that, many, adolescents, who, engage, in, oral, sex, do, not, consider, it, to, be, sex, therefore, they, may, use, oral, sex, as, an, option, to, experience, sex, while, still, in, their, minds, remaining, abstinent, upton, et, al, stated, it, is, possible, that, individuals, who, engage, in, oral, sex, but, do, not, consider, it, as, sex, may, not, associate, the, acts, with, the, potential, health, risks, they, can, bring, in, other, cases, condom, use, is, a, factor, with, some, men, stating, that, sexual, activity, involving, the, protection, of, a, condom, is, not, real, sex, or, the, real, thing, this, view, is, common, among, men, in, africa, where, sexual, activity, involving, the, protection, of, a, condom, is, often, associated, with, emasculation, because, condoms, prevent, direct, penile, to, skin, genital, contact, sexual, intercourse, or, other, sexual, activity, can, encompass, various, sexually, stimulating, factors, physiological, stimulation, or, psychological, stimulation, including, different, sex, positions, such, as, the, missionary, position, the, most, common, human, sex, position, or, the, use, of, sex, toys, foreplay, may, precede, some, sexual, activities, often, leading, to, sexual, arousal, of, the, partners, and, resulting, in, the, erection, of, the, penis, or, natural, lubrication, of, the, vagina, it, is, also, common, for, people, to, be, as, sexually, satisfied, by, being, kissed, touched, erotically, or, held, as, they, are, during,

copulatory, reflexes, in, various, organisms, but, in, humans, the, detection, of, pheromones, is, impaired, and, they, have, only, residual, effects, non, primate, females, put, themselves, in, the, crucial, lordosis, position, and, remain, motionless, but, these, motor, copulatory, reflexes, are, no, longer, functional, in, women, during, coitus, the, partners, orient, their, hips, to, allow, the, penis, to, move, back, and, forth, in, the, vagina, to, cause, friction, typically, without, fully, removing, the, penis, in, this, way, they, stimulate, themselves, and, each, other, often, continuing, until, orgasm, in, either, or, both, partners, is, achieved, for, human, females, stimulation, of, the, clitoris, plays, a, significant, role, in, sexual, activity, 70, 80, of, women, require, direct, clitoral, stimulation, to, achieve, orgasm, though, indirect, clitoral, stimulation, for, example, via, vaginal, intercourse, may, also, be, sufficient, see, orgasm, in, females, because, of, this, some, couples, may, engage, in, the, woman, on, top, position, or, the, coital, alignment, technique, a, technique, combining, the, riding, high, variation, of, the, missionary,

reproduction, involves, penile, vaginal, penetration, during, which, semen, containing, male, gametes, known, as, sperm, cells, or, spermatozoa, is, ejaculated, through, the, penis, into, the, vagina, the, sperm, passes, through, the, vaginal, vault, cervix, and, into, the, uterus, and, then, into, the, fallopian, tubes, millions, of, sperm, are, ejaculated, to, increase, the, chances, of, fertilization, see, sperm, competition, but, only, one, is, sufficient, to, fertilize, an, egg, or, ovum, when, a, fertile, ovum, from, the, female, is, present, in, the, fallopian, tubes, the, male, gamete, fertilizes, the, ovum, forming, a, new, embryo, pregnancy, begins, after, the, fertilized, ovum, is, implanted, in, the, lining, of, the, uterus, the, endometrium, pregnancy, rates, for, sexual, intercourse, are, highest, during, the, menstrual, cycle, time, from, some, five, days, before, until, approximately, one, day, after, ovulation, this, is, sometimes, called, the, fertile, window, for, optimal, pregnancy, chance, there, are, recommendations, of, vaginal, intercourse, every, one, or, two, days, or, every, two, or, three, days, some, people, who, are, trying, to,

are, under, 40, years, old, however, it, is, not, clear, from, medical, evidence, if, timed, intercourse, improves, the, rate, of, ultra, sound, confirmed, pregnancies, and, it, is, also, not, clear,

during, intercrural, sex, or, other, genital, genital, rubbing, and, its, sperm, is, deposited, near, the, vagina, s, entrance, and, travels, along, the, vagina, s, lubricating, fluids, the, risk, of, pregnancy, can, also, occur, without, the, penis, being, near, the, vagina, because, sperm, may, be, transported, to, the, vaginal, opening, by, the, vagina, coming, in, contact, with, fingers, or, other, non, genital, body, parts, that, have, come, in, contact, with, semen, safe, sex, is, a, relevant, harm, reduction, philosophy, and, condoms, are, used, as, a, form, of, safe, sex, and,

portugal, greece, and, romania, are, noted, and, such, from, latin, america, brazil, chile, and, the, dominican, republic, the, study, considered, many, asian, societies, to, also, fall, into, this, group, although, matching, data, was, only, available, from, thailand, in, the, third, group, age, of, men, and, women, at, sexual, initiation, was, more, closely, matched, there, were, two, sub, groups, however, in, non, latin, catholic, countries, poland, and, lithuania, are, mentioned, age, at, sexual, initiation, was, higher, suggesting, later, marriage, and, reciprocal, valuing, of, male, and, female, virginity, the, same, pattern, of, late, marriage, and, reciprocal, valuing, of, virginity, was, reflected, in, singapore, and, sri, lanka, the, study, considered, china, and, vietnam, to, also, fall, into, this, group, though, data, were, not, available, in, northern, and, eastern, european, countries, age, at, sexual, initiation, was, lower, with, both, men, and, women, involved, in, sexual, intercourse, before, any, union, formation, the, study, listed, switzerland, germany, and, the, czech, republic, as, members, of, this, group, concerning, united, states, data,

that, 45, 5, percent, of, girls, and, 45, 7, percent, of, boys, had, engaged, in, sexual, activity, by, 19, in, 2002, in, 2011, reporting, their, research, from, 2006, to, 2010, they, stated, that, 43, of, american, unmarried, teenage, girls, and, 42, of, american, unmarried, teenage, boys, have, ever, engaged, in, sexual, intercourse, the, cdc, also, reports, that, american, girls, will, most, likely, lose, their, virginity, to, a, boy, who, is, 1, to, 3, years, older, than, they, are, between, 1988, and, 2002, the, percentage, of, people, in, the, u, s, who, had, sexual, intercourse, between, the, ages, of, 15, and, 19, fell, from, 60, to, 46, percent, for, never, married, males, and, from, 51, to, 46, percent, for, never, married, females, in, humans, sexual, intercourse, and,

people, bond, and, build, trust, oxytocin, is, believed, to, have, a, more, significant, impact, on, women, than, on, men, which, may, be, why, women, associate, sexual, attraction, or, sexual, activity, with, romance, and, love, more, than, men, do, a, long, term, study, of, 3, 500, people, between, ages, 18, and, 102, by, clinical, neuropsychologist, david, weeks, indicated, that, based, on, impartial, ratings, of, the, subjects, photographs, sex, on, a, regular, basis, is, associated, with, people, looking, significantly, chronologically, younger, however, this, does, not, imply, causality, vaginal, intercourse, for, the, first, time, increases, vaginal, immune, activity, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, are, bacteria, viruses, or, parasites, that, are, spread, by, sexual, contact, especially, vaginal, anal, or, oral, intercourse, or, unprotected, sex, oral, sex, is, less, risky, than, vaginal, or, anal, intercourse, many, times, stis, initially, do, not, cause, symptoms, increasing, the, risk, of, unknowingly, passing, the, infection, on, to, a, sex, partner, or, others, there, are, 19, million, new, cases, of, sexually, transmitted, infections, every, year, in, the, u, s, and, in, 2005, the, world, health, organization, who, estimated, that, 448, million, people, aged, 15, 49, were, infected, per, year, with, curable, stis, such, as, syphilis, gonorrhea, and, chlamydia, some, stis, can, cause, a, genital, ulcer, even, if, they, do, not, they, increase, the, risk, of, both, acquiring, and, passing, on, hiv, up, to, ten, fold, hepatitis, b, can, also, be, transmitted, through, sexual, contact, globally, there, are, about, 257, million, chronic, carriers, of, hepatitis, b, hiv, is, one, of, the, world, s, leading, infectious, killers, in, 2010, approximately, 30, million, people, were, estimated, to, have, died, because, of, it, since, the, beginning, of, the, epidemic, of, the, 2, 7, million, new, hiv, infections, estimated, to, occur, worldwide, in, 2010, 1, 9, million, 70, were, in, africa, the, world, health, organization, also, stated, that, the, estimated, 1, 2, million, africans, who, died, of, hiv, related, illnesses, in, 2010, comprised, 69, of, the, global, total, of, 1, 8, million, deaths, attributable, to, the, epidemic, it, is, diagnosed, by, blood, tests, and, while, no, cure, has, been, found, it, can, be, controlled, by, management, through, antiretroviral, drugs, for, the, disease, and, patients, can, enjoy, healthy, and, productive, lives, in, cases, where, infection, is, suspected, early, medical, intervention, is, highly, beneficial, in, all, cases, the, cdc, stated, the, risk, of, hiv, transmission, from, an, infected, partner, through, oral, sex, is, much, less, than, the, risk, of, hiv, transmission, from, anal, or, vaginal, sex, but, that, measuring, the, exact, risk, of, hiv, transmission, as, a, result, of, oral, sex, is, very, difficult, and, that, this, is, because, most, sexually, active, individuals, practice, oral, sex, in, addition, to, other, forms, of, sex, such, as, vaginal, or, anal, sex, when, transmission, occurs, it, is, difficult, to, determine, whether, it, occurred, as, a, result, of, oral, sex, or, other, more, risky, sexual, activities, they, added, that, several, co, factors, may, increase, the, risk, of, hiv, transmission, through, oral, sex, this, includes, ulcers, bleeding, gums, genital, sores, and, the, presence, of, other, stis, in, 2005, the, world, health, organization, estimated, that, 123, million, women, become, pregnant, worldwide, each, year, and, around, 87, million, of, those, pregnancies, or, 70, 7, are, unintentional, approximately, 46, million, pregnancies, per, year, reportedly, end, in, induced, abortion, approximately, 6, million, u, s, women, become, pregnant, per, year, out, of, known, pregnancies, two, thirds, result, in, live, births, and, roughly, 25, in, abortions, the, remainder, end, in, miscarriage, however, many, more, women, become, pregnant, and, miscarry, without, even, realizing, it, instead, mistaking, the, miscarriage, for, an, unusually, heavy, menstruation, the, u, s, teenage, pregnancy, rate, fell, by, 27, percent, between, 1990, and, 2000, from, 116, 3, pregnancies, per, 1, 000, girls, aged, 15, 19, to, 84, 5, this, data, includes, live, births, abortions, and, fetal, losses, almost, 1, million, american, teenage, women, 10, of, all, women, aged, 15, 19, and, 19, of, those, who, report, having, had, intercourse, become, pregnant, each, year, sexual, activity, can, increase, the, expression, of, a, gene, transcription, factor, called, fosb, delta, fosb, in, the, brain, s, reward, center, consequently, excessively, frequent, engagement, in, sexual, activity, on, a, regular, daily, basis, can, lead, to, the, overexpression, of, fosb, inducing, an, addiction, to, sexual, activity, sexual, addiction, or, hypersexuality, is, often, considered, an, impulse, control, disorder, or, a, behavioral, addiction, it, has, been, linked, to, atypical, levels, of, dopamine, a, neurotransmitter, this, behavior, is, characterized, by, a, fixation, on, sexual, intercourse, and, disinhibition, it, was, proposed, that, this, addictive, behavior, be, classified, in, dsm, 5, as, an, impulsive, compulsive, behavioral, disorder, addiction, to, sexual, intercourse, is, thought, to, be, genetically, linked, those, having, an, addiction, to, sexual, intercourse, have, a, higher, response, to, visual, sexual, cues, in, the, brain, those, seeking, treatment, will, typically, see, a, physician, for, pharmacological, management, and, therapy, one, form, of, hypersexuality, is, kleine, levin, syndrome, it, is, manifested, by, hypersomnia, and, hypersexuality, and, remains, relatively, rare, sexual, activity, can, directly, cause, death, particularly, due, to, coronary, circulation, complications, which, is, sometimes, called, coital, death, coital, sudden, death, or, coital, coronary, however, coital, deaths, are, significantly, rare, people, especially, those, who, get, little, or, no, physical, exercise, have, a, slightly, increased, risk, of, triggering, a, heart, attack, or, sudden, cardiac, death, when, they, engage, in, sexual, intercourse, or, any, vigorous, physical, exercise, that, is, engaged, in, on, a, sporadic, basis, regular, exercise, reduces, but, does, not, eliminate, the, increased, risk, sexual, intercourse, when, involving, a, male, participant, often, ends, when, the, male, has, ejaculated, and, thus, the, partner, might, not, have, time, to, reach, orgasm, in, addition, premature, ejaculation, pe, is, common, and, women, often, require, a, substantially, longer, duration, of, stimulation, with, a, sexual, partner, than, men, do, before, reaching, an, orgasm, scholars, such, as, weiten, et, al, state, that, many, couples, are, locked, into, the, idea, that, orgasms, should, be, achieved, only, through, intercourse, that, the, word, foreplay, suggests, that, any, other, form, of, sexual, stimulation, is, merely, preparation, for, the, main, event, and, that, because, women, reach, orgasm, through, intercourse, less, consistently, than, men, they, are, likelier, than, men, to, fake, an, orgasm, to, satisfy, their, sexual, partners, in, 1991, scholars, from, the, kinsey, institute, stated, the, truth, is, that, the, time, between, penetration, and, ejaculation, varies, not, only, from, man, to, man, but, from, one, time, to, the, next, for, the, same, man, they, added, that, the, appropriate, length, for, sexual, intercourse, is, the, length, of, time, it, takes, for, both, partners, to, be, mutually, satisfied, emphasizing, that, kinsey, found, that, 75, percent, of, men, ejaculated, within, two, minutes, of, penetration, but, he, didn, t, ask, if, the, men, or, their, partners, considered, two, minutes, mutually, satisfying, and, more, recent, research, reports, slightly, longer, times, for, intercourse, a, 2008, survey, of, canadian, and, american, sex, therapists, stated, that, the, average, time, for, heterosexual, intercourse, coitus, was, 7, minutes, and, that, 1, to, 2, minutes, was, too, short, 3, to, 7, minutes, was, adequate, and, 7, to, 13, minutes, desirable, while, 10, to, 30, minutes, was, too, long, anorgasmia, is, regular, difficulty, reaching, orgasm, after, ample, sexual, stimulation, causing, personal, distress, this, is, significantly, more, common, in, women, than, in, men, which, has, been, attributed, to, the, lack, of, sex, education, with, regard, to, women, s, bodies, especially, in, sex, negative, cultures, such, as, clitoral, stimulation, usually, being, key, for, women, to, orgasm, the, physical, structure, of, coitus, favors, penile, stimulation, over, clitoral, stimulation, the, location, of, the, clitoris, then, usually, necessitates, manual, or, oral, stimulation, in, order, for, the, woman, to, achieve, orgasm, approximately, 25, of, women, report, difficulties, with, orgasm, 10, of, women, have, never, had, an, orgasm, and, 40, or, 40, 50, have, either, complained, about, sexual, dissatisfaction, or, experienced, difficulty, becoming, sexually, aroused, at, some, point, in, their, lives, vaginismus, is, involuntary, tensing, of, the, pelvic, floor, musculature, making, coitus, or, any, form, of, penetration, of, the, vagina, distressing, painful, and, sometimes, impossible, for, women, it, is, a, conditioned, reflex, of, the, pubococcygeus, muscle, and, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, pc, muscle, vaginismus, can, be, hard, to, overcome, because, if, a, woman, expects, to, experience, pain, during, sexual, intercourse, this, can, cause, a, muscle, spasm, which, results, in, painful, sexual, intercourse, treatment, of, vaginismus, often, includes, both, psychological, and, behavioral, techniques, including, the, use, of, vaginal, dilators, additionally, the, use, of, botox, as, a, medical, treatment, for, vaginismus, has, been, tested, and, administered, painful, or, uncomfortable, sexual, intercourse, may, also, be, categorized, as, dyspareunia, approximately, 40, of, males, reportedly, have, some, form, of, erectile, dysfunction, ed, or, impotence, at, least, occasionally, premature, ejaculation, has, been, reported, to, be, more, common, than, erectile, dysfunction, although, some, estimates, suggest, otherwise, due, to, various, meanings, of, the, disorder, estimates, for, the, prevalence, of, premature, ejaculation, vary, significantly, more, than, for, erectile, dysfunction, for, example, the, mayo, clinic, states, estimates, vary, but, as, many, as, 1, out, of, 3, men, may, be, affected, by, at, some, time, further, masters, and, johnson, speculated, that, premature, ejaculation, is, the, most, common, sexual, dysfunction, even, though, more, men, seek, therapy, for, erectile, difficulties, and, that, this, is, because, although, an, estimated, 15, percent, to, 20, percent, of, men, experience, difficulty, controlling, rapid, ejaculation, most, do, not, consider, it, a, problem, requiring, help, and, many, women, have, difficulty, expressing, their, sexual, needs, the, american, urological, association, aua, estimates, that, premature, ejaculation, could, affect, 21, percent, of, men, in, the, united, states, for, those, whose, impotence, is, caused, by, medical, conditions, prescription, drugs, such, as, viagra, cialis, and, levitra, are, available, however, doctors, caution, against, the, unnecessary, use, of, these, drugs, because, they, are, accompanied, by, serious, risks, such, as, increased, chance, of, heart, attack, the, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitor, ssri, and, antidepressant, drug, dapoxetine, has, been, used, to, treat, premature, ejaculation, in, clinical, trials, those, with, pe, who, took, dapoxetine, experienced, sexual, intercourse, three, to, four, times, longer, before, orgasm, than, without, the, drug, another, ejaculation, related, disorder, is, delayed, ejaculation, which, can, be, caused, as, an, unwanted, side, effect, of, antidepressant, medications, such, as, fluvoxamine, however, all, ssris, have, ejaculation, delaying, effects, and, fluvoxamine, has, the, least, ejaculation, delaying, effects, sexual, intercourse, remains, possible, after, major, medical, treatment, of, the, reproductive, organs, and, structures, this, is, especially, true, for, women, even, after, extensive, gynecological, surgical, procedures, such, as, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, salpingectomy, dilation, and, curettage, hymenotomy, bartholin, gland, surgery, abscess, removal, vestibulectomy, labia, minora, reduction, cervical, conization, surgical, and, radiological, cancer, treatments, and, chemotherapy, coitus, can, continue, reconstructive, surgery, remains, an, option, for, women, who, have, experienced, benign, and, malignant, conditions, obstacles, that, those, with, disabilities, face, with, regard, to, engaging, in, sexual, intercourse, include, pain, depression, fatigue, negative, body, image, stiffness, functional, impairment, anxiety, reduced, libido, hormonal, imbalance, and, drug, treatment, or, side, effects, sexual, functioning, has, been, regularly, identified, as, a, neglected, area, of, the, quality, of, life, in, patients, with, rheumatoid, arthritis, for, those, that, must, take, opioids, for, pain, control, sexual, intercourse, can, become, more, difficult, having, a, stroke, can, also, largely, impact, on, the, ability, to, engage, in, sexual, intercourse, although, disability, related, pain, including, as, a, result, of, cancer, and, mobility, impairment, can, hamper, sexual, intercourse, in, many, cases, the, most, significant, impediments, to, sexual, intercourse, for, individuals, with, a, disability, are, psychological, in, particular, people, who, have, a, disability, can, find, sexual, intercourse, daunting, due, to, issues, involving, their, self, concept, as, a, sexual, being, or, a, partner, s, discomfort, or, perceived, discomfort, temporary, difficulties, can, arise, with, alcohol, and, sex, as, alcohol, can, initially, increase, interest, through, disinhibition, but, decrease, capacity, with, greater, intake, however, disinhibition, can, vary, depending, on, the, culture, people, with, mental, disabilities, also, are, subject, to, challenges, in, participating, in, sexual, intercourse, this, can, include, the, lack, of, a, knowledgeable, healthcare, provider, trained, and, experienced, in, counseling, those, with, intellectual, disabilities, on, sexual, intercourse, those, with, intellectual, disabilities, may, have, hesitations, regarding, the, discussion, of, the, topic, of, sex, a, lack, of, sexual, knowledge, and, limited, opportunities, for, sex, education, in, addition, there, are, other, barriers, such, as, a, higher, prevalence, of, sexual, abuse, and, assault, these, crimes, often, remain, underreported, there, remains, a, lack, of, dialogue, around, this, population, s, human, right, to, consensual, sexual, expression, undertreatment, of, menstrual, disorders, and, legal, and, systemic, barriers, women, with, intellectual, disability, may, lack, sexual, health, care, and, sex, education, they, may, not, recognize, sexual, abuse, consensual, sexual, intercourse, is, not, always, an, option, for, some, those, with, intellectual, disability, may, have, limited, knowledge, and, access, to, contraception, screening, for, sexually, transmitted, infections, and, cervical, cancer, sexual, intercourse, may, be, for, reproductive, relational, or, recreational, purposes, it, often, plays, a, strong, role, in, human, bonding, in, many, societies, it, is, normal, for, couples, to, have, sexual, intercourse, while, using, some, method, of, birth, control, sharing, pleasure, and, strengthening, their, emotional, bond, through, sexual, activity, even, though, they, are, deliberately, avoiding, pregnancy, in, humans, and, bonobos, the, female, undergoes, relatively, concealed, ovulation, so, that, male, and, female, partners, commonly, do, not, know, whether, she, is, fertile, at, any, given, moment, one, possible, reason, for, this, distinct, biological, feature, may, be, formation, of, strong, emotional, bonds, between, sexual, partners, important, for, social, interactions, and, in, the, case, of, humans, long, term, partnership, rather, than, immediate, sexual, reproduction, sexual, dissatisfaction, due, to, the, lack, of, sexual, intercourse, is, associated, with, increased, risk, of, divorce, and, relationship, dissolution, especially, for, men, some, research, however, indicates, that, general, dissatisfaction, with, marriage, for, men, results, if, their, wives, flirted, with, erotically, kissed, or, became, romantically, or, sexually, involved, with, another, man, infidelity, and, that, this, is, especially, the, case, for, men, with, a, lower, emotional, and, composite, marital, satisfaction, other, studies, report, that, the, lack, of, sexual, intercourse, does, not, significantly, result, in, divorce, though, it, is, commonly, one, of, the, various, contributors, to, it, according, to, the, 2010, national, survey, of, sexual, health, and, behavior, nsshb, men, whose, most, recent, sexual, encounter, was, with, a, relationship, partner, reported, greater, arousal, greater, pleasure, fewer, problems, with, erectile, function, orgasm, and, less, pain, during, the, event, than, men, whose, last, sexual, encounter, was, with, a, non, relationship, partner, for, women, there, is, often, a, complaint, about, the, lack, of, their, spouses, sexual, spontaneity, decreased, sexual, activity, among, these, women, may, be, the, result, of, their, perceived, failure, to, maintain, ideal, physical, attractiveness, or, because, their, sexual, partners, health, issues, have, hindered, sexual, intercourse, some, women, express, that, their, most, satisfying, sexual, experiences, entail, being, connected, to, someone, rather, than, solely, basing, satisfaction, on, orgasm, with, regard, to, divorce, women, are, more, likely, to, divorce, their, spouses, for, a, one, night, stand, or, various, infidelities, if, they, are, in, less, cooperative, or, high, conflict, marriages, research, additionally, indicates, that, non, married, couples, who, are, cohabiting, engage, in, sexual, intercourse, more, often, than, married, couples, and, are, more, likely, to, participate, in, sexual, activity, outside, of, their, sexual, relationships, this, may, be, due, to, the, honeymoon, effect, the, newness, or, novelty, of, sexual, intercourse, with, the, partner, since, sexual, intercourse, is, usually, practiced, less, the, longer, a, couple, is, married, with, couples, engaging, in, sexual, intercourse, or, other, sexual, activity, once, or, twice, a, week, or, approximately, six, to, seven, times, a, month, sexuality, in, older, age, also, affects, the, frequency, of, sexual, intercourse, as, older, people, generally, engage, in, sexual, intercourse, less, frequently, than, younger, people, do, adolescents, commonly, use, sexual, intercourse, for, relational, and, recreational, purposes, which, may, negatively, or, positively, impact, their, lives, for, example, while, teenage, pregnancy, may, be, welcomed, in, some, cultures, it, is, also, commonly, disparaged, and, research, suggests, that, the, earlier, onset, of, puberty, for, children, puts, pressure, on, children, and, teenagers, to, act, like, adults, before, they, are, emotionally, or, cognitively, ready, some, studies, have, concluded, that, engaging, in, sexual, intercourse, leaves, adolescents, especially, girls, with, higher, levels, of, stress, and, depression, and, that, girls, may, be, likelier, to, engage, in, sexual, risk, such, as, sexual, intercourse, without, the, use, of, a, condom, but, it, may, be, that, further, research, is, needed, in, these, areas, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, sex, education, and, abstinence, only, sex, education, curricula, are, available, to, educate, adolescents, about, sexual, activity, these, programs, are, controversial, as, debate, exists, as, to, whether, teaching, children, and, adolescents, about, sexual, intercourse, or, other, sexual, activity, should, only, be, left, up, to, parents, or, other, caregivers, some, studies, from, the, 1970s, through, 1990s, suggested, an, association, between, self, esteem, and, sexual, intercourse, among, adolescents, while, other, studies, from, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, reported, that, the, research, generally, indicates, little, or, no, relationship, between, self, esteem, and, sexual, activity, among, adolescents, by, the, 1990s, the, evidence, mostly, supported, the, latter, and, further, research, has, supported, little, or, no, relationship, between, self, esteem, and, sexual, activity, among, adolescents, scholar, lisa, arai, stated, the, idea, that, early, sexual, activity, and, pregnancy, is, linked, to, low, self, esteem, became, fashionable, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, particularly, in, the, us, adding, that, yet, in, a, systematic, review, of, the, relationship, between, self, esteem, and, teenagers, sexual, behaviours, attitudes, and, intentions, which, analyzed, findings, from, 38, publications, 62, of, behavioral, findings, and, 72, of, the, attitudinal, findings, exhibited, no, statistically, significant, associations, goodson, et, al, 2006, studies, that, do, find, a, link, suggest, that, non, virgin, boys, have, higher, self, esteem, than, virgin, boys, and, that, girls, who, have, low, self, esteem, and, poor, self, image, are, more, prone, to, risk, taking, behaviors, such, as, unprotected, sex, and, multiple, sexual, partners, psychiatrist, lynn, ponton, wrote, all, adolescents, have, sex, lives, whether, they, are, sexually, active, with, others, with, themselves, or, seemingly, not, at, all, and, that, viewing, adolescent, sexuality, as, a, potentially, positive, experience, rather, than, as, something, inherently, dangerous, may, help, young, people, develop, healthier, patterns, and, make, more, positive, choices, regarding, sexual, activity, researchers, state, that, long, term, romantic, relationships, allow, adolescents, to, gain, the, skills, necessary, for, high, quality, relationships, later, in, life, overall, positive, romantic, relationships, among, adolescents, can, result, in, long, term, benefits, high, quality, romantic, relationships, are, associated, with, higher, commitment, in, early, adulthood, and, are, positively, associated, with, social, competence, while, sexual, intercourse, as, coitus, is, the, natural, mode, of, reproduction, for, the, human, species, humans, have, intricate, moral, and, ethical, guidelines, which, regulate, the, practice, of, sexual, intercourse, and, vary, according, to, religious, and, governmental, laws, some, governments, and, religions, also, have, strict, designations, of, what, they, consider, appropriate, and, inappropriate, sexual, behavior, which, include, restrictions, on, the, types, of, sex, acts, which, are, permissible, a, historically, prohibited, or, regulated, sex, act, is, anal, sex, sexual, intercourse, with, a, person, against, their, will, or, without, their, consent, is, rape, but, may, also, be, called, sexual, assault, it, is, considered, a, serious, crime, in, most, countries, more, than, 90, of, rape, victims, are, female, 99, of, rapists, male, and, only, about, 5, of, rapists, are, strangers, to, the, victims, most, countries, have, age, of, consent, laws, which, set, the, minimum, legal, age, with, whom, an, older, person, may, engage, in, sexual, intercourse, usually, set, at, 16, to, 18, but, ranges, from, 12, to, 20, years, of, age, in, some, societies, an, age, of, consent, is, set, by, non, statutory, custom, or, tradition, sex, with, a, person, under, the, age, of, consent, regardless, of, their, stated, consent, is, often, considered, sexual, assault, or, statutory, rape, depending, on, differences, in, ages, of, the, participants, some, countries, treat, any, sex, with, a, person, of, diminished, or, insufficient, mental, capacity, to, give, consent, regardless, of, age, as, rape, robert, francoeur, et, al, stated, that, prior, to, the, 1970s, rape, definitions, of, sex, often, included, only, penile, vaginal, sexual, intercourse, authors, pamela, j, kalbfleisch, and, michael, j, cody, stated, that, this, made, it, so, that, if, sex, means, penile, vaginal, intercourse, then, rape, means, forced, penile, vaginal, intercourse, and, other, sexual, behaviors, such, as, fondling, a, person, s, genitals, without, her, or, his, consent, forced, oral, sex, and, same, sex, coercion, are, not, considered, rape, they, stated, that, although, some, other, forms, of, forced, sexual, contact, are, included, within, the, legal, category, of, sodomy, e, g, anal, penetration, and, oral, genital, contact, many, unwanted, sexual, contacts, have, no, legal, grounding, as, rape, in, some, states, ken, plumber, argued, that, the, legal, meaning, of, rape, in, most, countries, is, unlawful, sexual, intercourse, which, means, the, penis, must, penetrate, the, vagina, and, that, other, forms, of, sexual, violence, towards, women, such, as, forced, oral, sex, or, anal, intercourse, or, the, insertion, of, other, objects, into, the, vagina, constitute, the, less, serious, crime, of, sexual, assault, over, time, the, meaning, of, rape, broadened, in, some, parts, of, the, world, to, include, many, types, of, sexual, penetration, including, anal, intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, and, penetration, of, the, genitals, or, rectum, by, an, inanimate, object, until, 2012, the, federal, bureau, of, investigation, fbi, still, considered, rape, a, crime, solely, committed, by, men, against, women, in, 2012, they, changed, the, meaning, from, the, carnal, knowledge, of, a, female, forcibly, and, against, her, will, to, the, penetration, no, matter, how, slight, of, the, vagina, or, anus, with, any, body, part, or, object, or, oral, penetration, by, a, sex, organ, of, another, person, without, the, consent, of, the, victim, the, meaning, does, not, change, federal, or, state, criminal, codes, or, impact, charging, and, prosecution, on, the, federal, state, or, local, level, but, instead, assures, that, rape, will, be, more, accurately, reported, nationwide, in, some, instances, penetration, is, not, required, for, the, act, to, be, categorized, as, rape, in, most, societies, around, the, world, the, concept, of, incest, exists, and, is, criminalized, james, roffee, a, senior, lecturer, in, criminology, at, monash, university, addressed, potential, harm, associated, with, familial, sexual, activity, such, as, resulting, children, born, with, deficiencies, however, the, law, is, more, concerned, with, protecting, the, rights, of, people, who, are, potentially, subjected, to, such, abuse, this, is, why, familial, sexual, relationships, are, criminalized, even, if, all, parties, are, consensual, there, are, laws, prohibiting, all, kinds, of, sexual, activity, between, relatives, not, necessarily, penetrative, sex, these, laws, refer, to, grandparents, parents, children, siblings, aunts, and, uncles, there, are, differences, between, states, in, terms, of, the, severity, of, punishments, and, what, they, consider, to, be, a, relative, including, biological, parents, step, parents, adoptive, parents, and, half, siblings, another, sexual, matter, concerning, consent, is, zoophilia, which, is, a, paraphilia, involving, sexual, activity, between, human, and, non, human, animals, or, a, fixation, on, such, practice, human, sexual, activity, with, non, human, animals, is, not, outlawed, in, some, jurisdictions, but, it, is, illegal, in, others, under, animal, abuse, laws, or, laws, dealing, with, crimes, against, nature, sexual, intercourse, has, traditionally, been, considered, an, essential, part, of, a, marriage, with, many, religious, customs, requiring, consummation, of, the, marriage, and, citing, marriage, as, the, most, appropriate, union, for, sexual, reproduction, procreation, in, such, cases, a, failure, for, any, reason, to, consummate, the, marriage, would, be, considered, a, ground, for, annulment, which, does, not, require, a, divorce, process, sexual, relations, between, marriage, partners, have, been, a, marital, right, in, various, societies, and, religions, both, historically, and, in, modern, times, especially, with, regard, to, a, husband, s, rights, to, his, wife, until, the, late, 20th, century, there, was, usually, a, marital, exemption, in, rape, laws, which, precluded, a, husband, from, being, prosecuted, under, the, rape, law, for, forced, sex, with, his, wife, author, oshisanya, lai, oshitokunbo, stated, as, the, legal, status, of, women, has, changed, the, concept, of, a, married, man, s, or, woman, s, marital, right, to, sexual, intercourse, has, become, less, widely, held, adultery, engaging, in, sexual, intercourse, with, someone, other, than, one, s, spouse, has,
