object, to, eating, meat, out, of, respect, for, sentient, animal, life, such, ethical, motivations, have, been, codified, under, various, religious, beliefs, as, well, as, animal, rights, advocacy, other, motivations, for, vegetarianism, are, health, related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, taste, related, or, relate, to, other, personal, preferences, there, are, many, variations, of, the, vegetarian, diet, an, ovo, lacto, vegetarian, diet, includes, both, eggs, and, dairy, products, an, ovo, vegetarian, diet, includes, eggs, but, not, dairy, products, and, a, lacto, vegetarian, diet, includes, dairy, products, but, not, eggs, as, the, strictest, of, vegetarian, diets, a, vegan, diet, excludes, all, animal, products, and, can, be, accompanied, by, abstention, from, the, use, of, animal, derived, products, such, as, leather, shoes, vegetarian, diets, pose, some, difficulties, for, vitamin, b, 12, depending, on, the, presence, or, absence, of, eggs, and, dairy, products, in, the, diet, or, other, reliable, b, 12, sources, vegetarians, may, incur, a, nutritional, deficiency, packaged, and, processed, foods, may, contain, minor, quantities, of, animal, ingredients, while, some, vegetarians, scrutinize, product, labels, for, such, ingredients, others, do, not, object, to, consuming, them, or, are, unaware, of, their, presence, the, first, written, use, of, the, term, vegetarian, originated, in, the, early, 19th, century, when, authors, referred, to, a, vegetable, regimen, diet, historically, vegetable, could, be, used, to, refer, to, any, type, of, edible, vegetation, modern, dictionaries, explain, its, origin, as, a, compound, of, vegetable, adjective, and, the, suffix, arian, in, the, sense, of, agrarian, the, term, was, popularized, with, the, foundation, of, the, vegetarian, society, in, manchester, in, 1847, although, it, may, have, appeared, in, print, before, 1847, the, earliest, occurrences, of, the, term, seem, to, be, related, to, alcott, house, a, school, on, the, north, side, of, ham, common, london, which, was, opened, in, july, 1838, by, james, pierrepont, greaves, from, 1841, it, was, known, as, a, concordium, or, industry, harmony, college, and, the, institution, then, began, to, publish, its, own, pamphlet, the, healthian, it, provides, some, of, the, earliest, appearances, of, the, term, vegetarian, the, earliest, record, of, vegetarianism, comes, from, the, 9th, century, bce, inculcating, tolerance, towards, all, living, beings, parshwanatha, and, mahavira, the, 23rd, and, 24th, tirthankaras, in, jainism, respectively, revived, and, advocated, ahimsa, and, jain, vegetarianism, between, the, 8th, and, 6th, centuries, bce, the, most, comprehensive, and, strictest, form, of, vegetarianism, in, indian, culture, vegetarianism, has, been, closely, connected, with, the, attitude, of, nonviolence, towards, animals, called, ahimsa, in, india, for, millennia, and, was, promoted, by, religious, groups, and, philosophers, the, c, r, ga, s, tra, from, 5th, century, bce, advocates, jain, vegetarianism, and, forbids, the, monks, from, walking, on, grass, in, order, to, avoid, inflicting, pain, on, them, and, prevent, small, insects, dwelling, inside, from, getting, killed, the, ancient, indian, work, of, the, tirukku, a, dated, before, the, 5th, century, ce, explicitly, and, unambiguously, emphasizes, shunning, meat, and, non, killing, as, a, common, man, s, virtues, 156, 171, 13, 127, 129, chapter, 26, of, the, tirukkural, particularly, couplets, 251, 260, deals, exclusively, on, moral, vegetarianism, or, veganism, 156, 171, vegetarianism, in, ancient, india, throughout, the, whole, country, the, people, do, not, kill, any, living, creature, nor, drink, intoxicating, liquor, nor, eat, onions, or, garlic, the, only, exception, is, that, of, the, chandalas, that, is, the, name, for, those, who, are, held, to, be, wicked, men, and, live, apart, from, others, in, that, country, they, do, not, keep, pigs, and, fowls, and, do, not, sell, live, cattle, in, the, markets, there, are, no, butchers, shops, and, no, dealers, in, intoxicating, drink, in, buying, and, selling, commodities, they, use, cowries, only, the, chandalas, are, fishermen, and, hunters, and, sell, flesh, meat, faxian, chinese, pilgrim, to, india, 4th, 5th, century, ce, a, record, of, buddhistic, kingdoms, translated, by, james, legge, among, the, hellenes, egyptians, and, others, vegetarianism, had, medical, or, ritual, purification, purposes, vegetarianism, was, also, practiced, in, ancient, greece, and, the, earliest, reliable, evidence, for, vegetarian, theory, and, practice, in, greece, dates, from, the, 6th, century, bce, the, orphics, a, religious, movement, spreading, in, greece, at, that, time, also, practiced, and, promoted, vegetarianism, greek, teacher, pythagoras, who, promoted, the, altruistic, doctrine, of, metempsychosis, may, have, practiced, vegetarianism, but, is, also, recorded, as, eating, meat, a, fictionalized, portrayal, of, pythagoras, appears, in, ovid, s, metamorphoses, in, which, he, advocates, a, form, of, strict, vegetarianism, it, was, through, this, portrayal, that, pythagoras, was, best, known, to, english, speakers, throughout, the, early, modern, period, and, prior, to, the, coinage, of, the, word, vegetarianism, vegetarians, were, referred, to, in, english, as, pythagoreans, vegetarianism, was, also, practiced, about, six, centuries, later, in, another, instance, 30, bce, 50, ce, in, the, northern, thracian, region, by, the, moesi, tribe, who, inhabited, present, day, serbia, and, bulgaria, feeding, themselves, on, honey, milk, and, cheese, in, japan, in, 675, the, emperor, tenmu, prohibited, the, killing, and, the, eating, of, meat, during, the, busy, farming, period, between, april, and, september, but, excluded, the, eating, of, wild, birds, and, wild, animals, these, bans, and, several, others, that, followed, over, the, centuries, were, overturned, in, the, nineteenth, century, during, the, meiji, restoration, in, china, during, the, song, dynasty, buddhist, cuisine, became, popular, enough, that, vegetarian, restaurants, appeared, where, chefs, used, ingredients, such, as, beans, gluten, root, vegetables, and, mushrooms, to, create, meat, analogues, including, pork, fowl, eggs, and, crab, roe, and, many, meat, substitutes, used, even, today, such, as, tofu, seitan, and, konjac, originate, in, chinese, buddhist, cuisine, following, the, christianization, of, the, roman, empire, in, late, antiquity, vegetarianism, practically, disappeared, from, europe, as, it, did, elsewhere, except, in, india, several, orders, of, monks, in, medieval, europe, restricted, or, banned, the, consumption, of, meat, for, ascetic, reasons, but, none, of, them, eschewed, fish, moreover, the, medieval, definition, of, fish, included, such, animals, as, seals, porpoises, dolphins, barnacle, geese, puffins, and, beavers, vegetarianism, re, emerged, during, the, renaissance, becoming, more, widespread, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, in, 1847, the, first, vegetarian, society, was, founded, in, the, united, kingdom, germany, the, netherlands, and, other, countries, followed, in, 1886, the, vegetarian, colony, nueva, germania, was, founded, in, paraguay, though, its, vegetarian, aspect, would, prove, short, lived, 345, 358, the, international, vegetarian, union, an, association, of, the, national, societies, was, founded, in, 1908, in, the, western, world, the, popularity, of, vegetarianism, grew, during, the, 20th, century, as, a, result, of, nutritional, ethical, and, more, recently, environmental, and, economic, concerns, there, are, a, number, of, vegetarian, diets, that, exclude, or, include, various, foods, within, the, ovo, groups, there, are, many, who, refuse, to, consume, fertilized, eggs, with, balut, being, an, extreme, example, however, such, distinction, is, typically, not, specifically, addressed, some, vegetarians, also, avoid, products, that, may, use, animal, ingredients, not, included, in, their, labels, or, which, use, animal, products, in, their, manufacturing, for, example, sugars, that, are, whitened, with, bone, char, cheeses, that, use, animal, rennet, enzymes, from, animal, stomach, lining, gelatin, derived, from, the, collagen, inside, animals, skin, bones, and, connective, tissue, some, cane, sugar, but, not, beet, sugar, and, beverages, such, as, apple, juice, and, alcohol, clarified, with, gelatin, or, crushed, shellfish, and, sturgeon, while, other, vegetarians, are, unaware, of, or, do, not, mind, such, ingredients, in, the, 21st, century, 90, of, rennet, and, chymosin, used, in, cheesemaking, are, derived, from, industrial, fermentation, processes, which, satisfy, both, kosher, and, halal, requirements, individuals, sometimes, label, themselves, vegetarian, while, practicing, a, semi, vegetarian, diet, as, some, dictionary, definitions, describe, vegetarianism, as, sometimes, including, the, consumption, of, fish, or, only, include, mammalian, flesh, as, part, of, their, definition, of, meat, while, other, definitions, exclude, fish, and, all, animal, flesh, in, other, cases, individuals, may, describe, themselves, as, flexitarian, these, diets, may, be, followed, by, those, who, reduce, animal, flesh, consumed, as, a, way, of, transitioning, to, a, complete, vegetarian, diet, or, for, health, ethical, environmental, or, other, reasons, semi, vegetarian, diets, include, semi, vegetarianism, is, contested, by, vegetarian, groups, such, as, the, vegetarian, society, which, states, that, vegetarianism, excludes, all, animal, flesh, consumption, of, eggs, is, not, considered, to, be, a, part, of, a, vegetarian, diet, in, india, as, egg, is, an, animal, product, that, gives, birth, to, the, next, generation, of, the, relevant, species, on, average, vegetarians, consume, a, lower, proportion, of, calories, from, fat, particularly, saturated, fatty, acids, fewer, overall, calories, more, fiber, potassium, and, vitamin, c, than, do, non, vegetarians, vegetarians, generally, have, a, lower, body, mass, index, these, characteristics, and, other, lifestyle, factors, associated, with, a, vegetarian, diet, may, contribute, to, the, positive, health, outcomes, that, have, been, identified, among, vegetarians, dietary, guidelines, for, americans, 2010, a, report, issued, by, the, u, s, department, of, agriculture, and, the, u, s, department, of, health, and, human, services, in, western, countries, the, most, common, motive, for, people, practicing, vegetarianism, is, health, consciousness, the, academy, of, nutrition, and, dietetics, has, stated, that, at, all, stages, of, life, a, properly, planned, vegetarian, diet, can, be, healthful, nutritionally, adequate, and, may, be, beneficial, in, the, prevention, and, treatment, of, certain, diseases, vegetarian, diets, offer, lower, levels, of, saturated, fat, cholesterol, and, animal, protein, and, higher, levels, of, carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, vitamins, c, and, e, and, phytochemicals, studies, have, shown, that, a, non, lacto, vegetarian, diet, may, increase, the, risk, of, calcium, deficiency, and, low, bone, mineral, density, a, 2019, review, found, that, vegetarians, have, lower, bone, mineral, density, at, the, femoral, neck, and, lumbar, spine, compared, to, omnivores, a, 2020, meta, analysis, found, that, infants, fed, a, lacto, vegetarian, diet, exhibited, normal, growth, and, development, a, 2021, review, found, no, differences, in, growth, between, vegetarian, and, meat, eating, children, vegetarian, diets, are, under, preliminary, research, for, their, potential, to, help, people, with, type, 2, diabetes, meta, analyses, have, reported, a, reduced, risk, of, death, from, ischemic, heart, disease, and, from, cerebrovascular, disease, among, vegetarians, reviews, of, vegan, and, vegetarian, diets, showed, a, possible, association, with, depression, and, anxiety, particularly, among, people, under, 26, years, old, another, review, found, no, significant, associations, between, a, vegetarian, diet, and, depression, or, anxiety, the, american, dietetic, association, discussed, that, vegetarian, diets, may, be, more, common, among, adolescents, with, eating, disorders, indicating, that, vegetarian, diets, do, not, cause, eating, disorders, but, rather, vegetarian, diets, may, be, selected, to, camouflage, an, existing, eating, disorder, a, 2012, study, found, a, reduced, risk, in, all, cause, mortality, in, vegetarians, a, 2017, review, found, a, lower, mortality, 25, from, ischemic, heart, disease, western, vegetarian, diets, are, typically, high, in, carotenoids, but, relatively, low, in, omega, 3, fatty, acids, and, vitamin, b, 12, vegans, can, have, particularly, low, intake, of, vitamin, b, and, calcium, if, they, do, not, eat, enough, items, such, as, collard, greens, leafy, greens, tempeh, and, tofu, soy, high, levels, of, dietary, fiber, folic, acid, vitamins, c, and, e, and, magnesium, and, low, consumption, of, saturated, fat, are, all, considered, to, be, beneficial, aspects, of, a, vegetarian, diet, a, well, planned, vegetarian, diet, will, provide, all, nutrients, in, a, meat, eater, s, diet, to, the, same, level, for, all, stages, of, life, protein, intake, in, vegetarian, diets, tends, to, be, lower, than, in, meat, diets, but, can, meet, the, daily, requirements, for, most, people, studies, at, harvard, university, as, well, as, other, studies, conducted, in, the, united, states, united, kingdom, canada, australia, new, zealand, and, various, european, countries, confirmed, that, vegetarian, diets, provide, sufficient, protein, intake, as, long, as, a, variety, of, plant, sources, are, available, and, consumed, vegetarian, diets, typically, contain, similar, levels, of, iron, to, non, vegetarian, diets, but, this, has, lower, bioavailability, than, iron, from, meat, sources, and, its, absorption, can, sometimes, be, inhibited, by, other, dietary, constituents, according, to, the, vegetarian, resource, group, consuming, food, that, contains, vitamin, c, such, as, citrus, fruit, or, juices, tomatoes, or, broccoli, is, a, good, way, to, increase, the, amount, of, iron, absorbed, at, a, meal, vegetarian, foods, rich, in, iron, include, black, beans, cashews, hempseed, kidney, beans, broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins, jaggery, spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black, eyed, peas, soybeans, many, breakfast, cereals, sunflower, seeds, chickpeas, tomato, juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and, whole, wheat, bread, the, related, vegan, diets, can, often, be, higher, in, iron, than, vegetarian, diets, because, dairy, products, are, low, in, iron, iron, stores, often, tend, to, be, lower, in, vegetarians, than, non, vegetarians, and, a, few, small, studies, report, very, high, rates, of, iron, deficiency, up, to, 40, and, 58, of, the, respective, vegetarian, or, vegan, groups, however, the, american, dietetic, association, states, that, iron, deficiency, is, no, more, common, in, vegetarians, than, non, vegetarians, adult, males, are, rarely, iron, deficient, iron, deficiency, anaemia, is, rare, no, matter, the, diet, vitamin, b, 12, is, not, generally, present, in, plants, but, is, naturally, found, in, foods, of, animal, origin, lacto, ovo, vegetarians, can, obtain, b, 12, from, dairy, products, and, eggs, and, vegans, can, obtain, it, from, manufactured, fortified, foods, including, plant, based, products, and, breakfast, cereals, and, dietary, supplements, a, strict, vegan, diet, avoiding, consumption, of, all, animal, products, risks, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, which, can, lead, to, hyperhomocysteinemia, a, risk, factor, for, several, health, disorders, including, anemia, neurological, deficits, gastrointestinal, problems, platelet, disorders, and, increased, risk, for, cardiovascular, diseases, the, recommended, daily, dietary, intake, of, b, 12, in, the, united, states, and, canada, is, 0, 4, mcg, ages, 0, 6, months, rising, to, 1, 8, mcg, 9, 13, years, 2, 4, mcg, 14, years, and, 2, 8, mcg, lactating, female, while, the, body, s, daily, requirement, for, vitamin, b, 12, is, in, microgram, amounts, deficiency, of, the, vitamin, through, strict, practice, of, a, vegetarian, diet, without, supplementation, can, increase, the, risk, of, several, chronic, diseases, plant, based, or, vegetarian, sources, of, omega, 3, fatty, acids, include, soy, walnuts, pumpkin, seeds, canola, oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia, seed, flaxseed, echium, seed, and, leafy, vegetables, such, as, lettuce, spinach, cabbage, and, purslane, purslane, contains, more, omega, 3, than, any, other, known, leafy, green, olives, and, olive, oil, are, another, important, plant, source, of, unsaturated, fatty, acids, plant, foods, can, provide, alpha, linolenic, acid, which, the, human, body, uses, to, synthesize, the, long, chain, n, 3, fatty, acids, epa, and, dha, epa, and, dha, can, be, obtained, directly, in, high, amounts, from, oily, fish, fish, oil, or, algae, oil, vegetarians, and, particularly, vegans, have, lower, levels, of, epa, and, dha, than, meat, eaters, while, the, health, effects, of, low, levels, of, epa, and, dha, are, unknown, it, is, unlikely, that, supplementation, with, alpha, linolenic, acid, will, significantly, increase, levels, significantly, for, vegetarians, certain, algae, such, as, spirulina, are, good, sources, of, gamma, linolenic, acid, gla, alpha, linolenic, acid, ala, linoleic, acid, la, stearidonic, acid, sda, eicosapentaenoic, acid, epa, docosahexaenoic, acid, dha, and, arachidonic, acid, aa, calcium, intake, in, vegetarians, and, vegans, can, be, similar, to, non, vegetarians, as, long, as, the, diet, is, properly, planned, lacto, ovo, vegetarians, that, include, dairy, products, can, still, obtain, calcium, from, dairy, sources, like, milk, yogurt, and, cheese, non, dairy, milks, that, are, fortified, with, calcium, such, as, soymilk, and, almond, milk, can, also, contribute, a, significant, amount, of, calcium, in, the, diet, broccoli, bok, choy, and, kale, have, also, been, found, to, have, calcium, that, is, well, absorbed, in, the, body, though, the, calcium, content, per, serving, is, lower, in, these, vegetables, than, a, glass, of, milk, the, absorption, of, the, calcium, into, the, body, is, higher, other, foods, that, contain, calcium, include, calcium, set, tofu, blackstrap, molasses, turnip, greens, mustard, greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried, figs, and, tahini, though, calcium, can, be, found, in, spinach, swiss, chard, beans, and, beet, greens, they, are, generally, not, considered, to, be, a, good, source, since, the, calcium, binds, to, oxalic, acid, and, is, poorly, absorbed, into, the, body, phytic, acid, found, in, nuts, seeds, and, beans, may, also, impact, calcium, absorption, rates, see, the, national, institutes, of, health, office, of, dietary, supplements, for, calcium, needs, for, various, ages, the, vegetarian, resource, group, and, the, vegetarian, nutrition, calcium, fact, sheet, from, the, academy, of, nutrition, and, dietetics, for, more, specifics, on, how, to, obtain, adequate, calcium, intake, on, a, vegetarian, or, vegan, diet, vitamin, d, needs, can, be, met, via, the, human, body, s, own, generation, upon, sufficient, and, sensible, exposure, to, ultraviolet, uv, light, in, sunlight, products, including, milk, soy, milk, and, cereal, grains, may, be, fortified, to, provide, a, source, of, vitamin, d, for, those, who, do, not, get, adequate, sun, exposure, or, food, sources, vitamin, d, supplementation, may, be, necessary, vitamin, d, 2, or, ergocalciferol, is, found, in, fungus, except, alfalfa, which, is, a, plantae, and, created, from, viosterol, which, in, turn, is, created, when, ultraviolet, light, activates, ergosterol, which, is, found, in, fungi, and, named, as, a, sterol, from, ergot, any, uv, irradiated, fungus, including, yeast, form, vitamin, d, 2, human, bioavailability, of, vitamin, d, 2, from, vitamin, d, 2, enhanced, button, mushrooms, via, uv, b, irradiation, is, effective, in, improving, vitamin, d, status, and, not, different, from, a, vitamin, d, 2, supplement, according, to, study, for, example, vitamin, d, 2, from, uv, irradiated, yeast, baked, into, bread, is, bioavailable, by, visual, assessment, or, using, a, chromometer, no, significant, discoloration, of, irradiated, mushrooms, as, measured, by, the, degree, of, whiteness, was, observed, making, it, hard, to, discover, if, they, have, been, treated, without, labeling, claims, have, been, made, that, a, normal, serving, approx, 3, oz, or, 1, 2, cup, or, 60, grams, of, mushrooms, treated, with, ultraviolet, light, increase, their, vitamin, d, content, to, levels, up, to, 80, micrograms, or, 2700, iu, if, exposed, to, just, 5, minutes, of, uv, light, after, being, harvested, choline, is, a, nutrient, that, helps, transfer, signals, between, nerve, cells, and, is, involved, in, liver, function, it, is, highest, in, dairy, foods, and, meat, but, it, is, possible, to, be, obtained, through, a, vegan, diet, with, regard, to, the, ethics, of, eating, meat, scholars, consider, vegetarianism, an, ideology, and, a, social, movement, ethical, reasons, for, choosing, vegetarianism, vary, and, are, usually, predicated, on, the, interests, of, non, human, animals, in, many, societies, controversies, and, debates, have, arisen, over, the, ethics, of, eating, animals, some, people, while, not, vegetarians, refuse, to, eat, the, flesh, of, certain, animals, due, to, cultural, taboo, such, as, cats, dogs, horses, or, rabbits, others, support, meat, eating, for, scientific, nutritional, and, cultural, reasons, including, religious, ones, some, meat, eaters, abstain, from, the, meat, of, animals, reared, in, particular, ways, such, as, factory, farms, or, avoid, certain, meats, such, as, veal, or, foie, gras, some, people, follow, vegetarian, or, vegan, diets, not, because, of, moral, concerns, involving, the, raising, or, consumption, of, animals, in, general, but, because, of, concerns, about, the, specific, treatment, and, practices, involved, in, the, processing, of, animals, for, food, others, still, avoid, meat, out, of, concern, that, meat, production, places, a, greater, burden, on, the, environment, than, production, of, an, equivalent, amount, of, plant, protein, ethical, objections, based, on, consideration, for, animals, are, generally, divided, into, opposition, to, the, act, of, killing, in, general, and, opposition, to, certain, agricultural, practices, surrounding, the, production, of, meat, ethical, vegetarians, believe, that, killing, an, animal, like, killing, a, human, especially, one, who, has, equal, or, lesser, cognitive, abilities, than, the, animals, in, question, can, only, be, justified, in, extreme, circumstances, and, that, consuming, a, living, creature, for, its, enjoyable, taste, convenience, or, nutrition, value, is, not, a, sufficient, cause, another, common, view, is, that, humans, are, morally, conscious, of, their, behavior, in, a, way, other, animals, are, not, and, therefore, subject, to, higher, standards, jeff, mcmahan, proposes, that, denying, the, right, to, life, and, humane, treatment, to, animals, with, equal, or, greater, cognitive, abilities, than, mentally, disabled, humans, is, an, arbitrary, and, discriminatory, practice, based, on, habit, instead, of, logic, opponents, of, ethical, vegetarianism, argue, that, animals, are, not, moral, equals, to, humans, and, so, consider, the, comparison, of, eating, livestock, with, killing, people, to, be, fallacious, this, view, does, not, excuse, cruelty, but, maintains, that, animals, do, not, possess, the, rights, a, human, has, one, of, the, main, differences, between, a, vegan, and, a, lacto, ovo, vegetarian, diet, is, the, avoidance, of, both, eggs, and, dairy, products, such, as, milk, cheese, butter, and, yogurt, ethical, vegans, do, not, consume, dairy, or, eggs, because, they, state, that, their, production, causes, the, animal, suffering, or, a, premature, death, to, produce, milk, from, dairy, cattle, farmers, separate, calves, from, their, mothers, soon, after, birth, to, retain, cow, milk, for, human, consumption, ethical, vegetarianism, has, become, popular, in, developed, countries, particularly, because, of, the, spread, of, factory, farming, and, environmental, consciousness, some, believe, that, the, current, mass, demand, for, meat, cannot, be, satisfied, without, a, mass, production, system, that, disregards, the, welfare, of, animals, while, others, believe, that, practices, like, well, managed, free, range, farming, or, the, consumption, of, game, particularly, from, species, whose, natural, predators, have, been, significantly, eliminated, could, substantially, alleviate, consumer, demand, for, mass, produced, meat, jainism, teaches, vegetarianism, as, moral, conduct, as, do, some, sects, of, hinduism, buddhism, in, general, does, not, prohibit, meat, eating, but, mahayana, buddhism, encourages, vegetarianism, as, beneficial, for, developing, compassion, other, denominations, that, advocate, a, vegetarian, diet, include, the, seventh, day, adventists, the, rastafari, movement, the, ananda, marga, movement, and, the, hare, krishnas, sikhism, does, not, equate, spirituality, with, diet, and, does, not, specify, a, vegetarian, or, meat, diet, while, there, are, no, dietary, restrictions, in, the, bah, faith, abdu, l, bah, the, son, of, the, religion, s, founder, noted, that, a, vegetarian, diet, consisting, of, fruits, and, grains, was, desirable, except, for, people, with, a, weak, constitution, or, those, that, are, sick, he, stated, that, there, are, no, requirements, that, bah, s, become, vegetarian, but, that, a, future, society, should, gradually, become, vegetarian, abdu, l, bah, also, stated, that, killing, animals, was, contrary, to, compassion, while, shoghi, effendi, the, head, of, the, bah, faith, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, stated, that, a, purely, vegetarian, diet, would, be, preferable, since, it, avoided, killing, animals, both, he, and, the, universal, house, of, justice, the, governing, body, of, the, bah, s, have, stated, that, these, teachings, do, not, constitute, a, bah, practice, and, that, bah, s, can, choose, to, eat, whatever, they, wish, but, should, be, respectful, of, others, beliefs, theravadins, in, general, eat, meat, if, buddhist, monks, see, hear, or, know, a, living, animal, was, killed, specifically, for, them, to, eat, they, must, refuse, it, or, else, incur, an, offense, however, this, does, not, include, eating, meat, which, was, given, as, alms, or, commercially, purchased, in, the, theravada, canon, shakyamuni, buddha, did, not, make, any, comment, discouraging, them, from, eating, meat, except, specific, types, such, as, human, elephant, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and, hyena, flesh, but, he, specifically, refused, to, institute, vegetarianism, in, his, monastic, code, when, a, suggestion, had, been, made, in, several, sanskrit, texts, of, mahayana, buddhism, buddha, instructs, his, followers, to, avoid, meat, however, each, branch, of, mahayana, buddhism, selects, which, sutra, to, follow, and, some, branches, including, the, majority, of, tibetan, and, japanese, buddhists, actually, do, eat, meat, meanwhile, chinese, korean, vietnamese, buddhism, in, some, sectors, of, east, asian, buddhism, monks, and, nuns, are, expected, to, abstain, from, meat, and, traditionally, to, abstain, from, eggs, and, dairy, as, well, different, buddhist, traditions, have, differing, teachings, on, diet, which, may, also, vary, for, ordained, monks, and, nuns, compared, to, others, many, interpret, the, precept, not, to, kill, to, require, abstinence, from, meat, but, not, all, in, taiwan, su, vegetarianism, excludes, not, only, all, animal, products, but, also, vegetables, in, the, allium, family, which, have, the, characteristic, aroma, of, onion, and, garlic, onion, garlic, scallions, leeks, chives, or, shallots, various, groups, within, christianity, have, practiced, specific, dietary, restrictions, for, various, reasons, the, council, of, jerusalem, in, around, 50, ad, recommended, christians, keep, following, some, of, the, jewish, food, laws, concerning, meat, the, early, sect, known, as, the, ebionites, are, considered, to, have, practiced, vegetarianism, surviving, fragments, from, their, gospel, indicate, their, belief, that, as, christ, is, the, passover, sacrifice, and, eating, the, passover, lamb, is, no, longer, required, a, vegetarian, diet, may, or, should, be, observed, however, orthodox, christianity, does, not, accept, their, teaching, as, authentic, indeed, their, specific, injunction, to, strict, vegetarianism, was, cited, as, one, of, the, ebionites, errors, at, a, much, later, time, the, bible, christian, church, founded, by, reverend, william, cowherd, in, 1809, followed, a, vegetarian, diet, cowherd, was, one, of, the, philosophical, forerunners, of, the, vegetarian, society, cowherd, encouraged, members, to, abstain, from, eating, of, meat, as, a, form, of, temperance, seventh, day, adventists, are, encouraged, to, engage, in, healthy, eating, practices, and, ovo, lacto, vegetarian, diets, are, recommended, by, the, general, conference, of, seventh, day, adventists, nutrition, council, gcnc, they, have, also, sponsored, and, participated, in, many, scientific, studies, exploring, the, impact, of, dietary, decisions, upon, health, outcomes, the, gcnc, has, in, addition, adapted, the, usda, s, food, pyramid, for, a, vegetarian, dietary, approach, however, the, only, kinds, of, meat, specifically, frowned, upon, by, the, sda, health, message, are, unclean, meats, or, those, forbidden, in, scripture, additionally, some, monastic, orders, follow, a, pescatarian, diet, and, members, of, the, eastern, orthodox, church, follow, a, vegan, diet, during, fasts, there, is, also, a, strong, association, between, the, quakers, and, vegetarianism, dating, back, at, least, to, the, 18th, century, the, association, grew, in, prominence, during, the, 19th, century, coupled, with, growing, quaker, concerns, in, connection, with, alcohol, consumption, anti, vivisection, and, social, purity, the, association, between, the, quaker, tradition, and, vegetarianism, however, becomes, most, significant, with, the, founding, of, the, friends, vegetarian, society, in, 1902, to, spread, a, kindlier, way, of, living, amongst, the, society, of, friends, the, seventh, day, adventist, church, is, well, known, for, presenting, a, health, message, that, recommends, vegetarianism, and, expects, adherence, to, the, kosher, laws, in, leviticus, 11, obedience, to, these, laws, means, abstinence, from, pork, shellfish, and, other, animals, proscribed, as, unclean, the, church, discourages, its, members, from, consuming, alcoholic, beverages, tobacco, or, illegal, drugs, compare, christianity, and, alcohol, in, addition, some, adventists, avoid, coffee, tea, cola, and, other, beverages, containing, caffeine, the, pioneers, of, the, adventist, church, had, much, to, do, with, the, common, acceptance, of, breakfast, cereals, into, the, western, diet, and, the, modern, commercial, concept, of, cereal, food, originated, among, adventists, john, harvey, kellogg, was, one, of, the, early, founders, of, adventist, health, work, his, development, of, breakfast, cereals, as, a, health, food, led, to, the, founding, of, kellogg, s, by, his, brother, william, in, both, australia, and, new, zealand, the, church, owned, sanitarium, health, and, wellbeing, company, is, a, leading, manufacturer, of, health, and, vegetarian, related, products, most, prominently, weet, bix, kellogg, encouraged, his, students, daniel, h, kress, and, lauretta, e, kress, to, study, medicine, together, at, the, university, of, michigan, medical, school, and, become, public, advocates, of, vegetarianism, together, they, published, an, important, vegetarian, cookbook, and, became, early, founders, of, what, was, later, washington, adventist, hospital, research, funded, by, the, u, s, national, institutes, of, health, has, shown, that, the, average, adventist, in, california, lives, 4, to, 10, years, longer, than, the, average, californian, the, research, as, cited, by, the, cover, story, of, the, november, 2005, issue, of, national, geographic, asserts, that, adventists, live, longer, because, they, do, not, smoke, or, drink, alcohol, have, a, day, of, rest, every, week, and, maintain, a, healthy, low, fat, vegetarian, diet, that, is, rich, in, nuts, and, beans, the, cohesiveness, of, adventists, social, networks, has, also, been, put, forward, as, an, explanation, for, their, extended, lifespan, since, dan, buettner, s, 2005, national, geographic, story, about, adventist, longevity, his, book, the, blue, zones, lessons, for, living, longer, from, the, people, who, ve, lived, the, longest, named, loma, linda, california, a, blue, zone, because, of, the, large, concentration, of, seventh, day, adventists, he, cites, the, adventist, emphasis, on, health, diet, and, sabbath, keeping, as, primary, factors, for, adventist, longevity, an, estimated, 35, of, adventists, practice, vegetarianism, or, veganism, according, to, a, 2002, worldwide, survey, of, local, church, leaders, north, american, adventist, health, study, recruitments, from, 2001, to, 2007, found, a, similar, prevalence, of, vegetarianism, veganism, a, small, majority, of, adventists, 54, were, conventional, meat, eaters, of, the, remaining, 46, it, was, found, that, 28, were, ovo, lacto, vegetarians, 10, were, pesco, vegetarians, and, 8, were, vegans, it, is, common, for, adventists, who, choose, to, eat, meat, to, also, eat, plant, based, foods, 6, of, the, meat, eaters, group, restricted, their, intake, of, meat, fish, to, no, more, than, once, per, week, though, there, is, no, strict, rule, on, what, to, consume, and, what, not, to, the, food, habits, of, hindus, vary, according, to, their, specific, caste, and, sub, caste, community, location, custom, and, varying, traditions, historically, and, currently, a, majority, of, hindus, about, 70, eat, meat, while, a, large, proportion, of, hindus, are, vegetarian, about, 30, some, sects, of, hinduism, such, as, vaishnavism, follow, the, purest, form, of, vegetarianism, as, an, ideal, while, shaktism, and, tantric, sects, freely, consume, chicken, mutton, goat, and, sheep, meat, fish, and, eggs, the, reasons, stated, by, jains, and, vaishnavas, are, the, principle, of, nonviolence, ahimsa, applied, to, animals, the, intention, to, offer, only, pure, vegetarian, food, to, a, deity, and, then, to, receive, it, back, as, prasada, and, the, conviction, that, a, sattvic, diet, is, beneficial, for, a, healthy, body, a, sattvic, diet, is, lacto, vegetarian, which, includes, dairy, but, excludes, eggs, an, overwhelming, majority, of, the, hindus, consider, the, cow, to, be, a, holy, and, sacred, animal, whose, slaughter, for, meat, is, forbidden, thus, beef, is, a, taboo, for, the, majority, of, hindus, jains, and, sikhs, some, followers, of, islam, or, muslims, chose, to, be, vegetarian, for, health, ethical, or, personal, reasons, however, the, choice, to, become, vegetarian, for, non, medical, reasons, can, sometimes, be, controversial, due, to, conflicting, fatwas, and, differing, interpretations, of, the, quran, though, some, more, traditional, muslims, may, keep, quiet, about, their, vegetarian, diet, the, number, of, vegetarian, muslims, is, increasing, sri, lankan, sufi, master, bawa, muhaiyaddeen, who, established, the, bawa, muhaiyaddeen, fellowship, of, north, america, in, philadelphia, the, former, indian, president, dr, a, p, j, abdul, kalam, was, also, famously, a, vegetarian, in, january, 1996, the, international, vegetarian, union, announced, the, formation, of, the, muslim, vegetarian, vegan, society, many, non, vegetarian, muslims, will, select, vegetarian, or, seafood, options, when, dining, in, non, halal, restaurants, however, this, is, a, matter, of, not, having, the, right, kind, of, meat, rather, than, preferring, not, to, eat, meat, on, the, whole, followers, of, jainism, believe, that, all, living, organisms, including, microorganisms, are, living, and, have, a, soul, and, have, one, or, more, senses, out, of, five, senses, they, go, to, great, lengths, to, minimise, any, harm, to, any, living, organism, most, jains, are, lacto, vegetarians, but, more, devout, jains, do, not, eat, root, vegetables, because, they, believe, that, root, vegetables, contain, many, more, microorganisms, as, compared, to, other, vegetables, and, that, by, eating, them, violence, against, these, microorganisms, is, inevitable, they, therefore, prefer, eating, beans, and, fruits, whose, cultivation, involves, killing, fewer, microorganisms, no, products, obtained, from, already, dead, animals, are, allowed, because, of, potential, violence, against, decomposing, microorganisms, some, particularly, dedicated, individuals, are, fruitarians, honey, is, forbidden, being, the, regurgitation, of, nectar, by, bees, and, potentially, containing, eggs, excreta, and, dead, bees, many, jains, do, not, consume, plant, parts, that, grow, underground, such, as, roots, and, bulbs, because, the, plants, themselves, and, tiny, animals, may, be, killed, when, the, plants, are, pulled, up, while, classical, jewish, law, neither, requires, nor, prohibits, the, consumption, of, meat, jewish, vegetarians, often, cite, jewish, principles, regarding, animal, welfare, environmental, ethics, moral, character, and, health, as, reasons, for, adopting, a, vegetarian, or, vegan, diet, rabbis, may, advocate, vegetarianism, or, veganism, primarily, because, of, concerns, about, animal, welfare, especially, in, light, of, the, traditional, prohibition, on, causing, unnecessary, pain, to, living, creatures, tza, ar, ba, alei, hayyim, some, jewish, vegetarian, groups, and, activists, believe, that, the, halakhic, permission, to, eat, meat, is, a, temporary, leniency, for, those, who, are, not, ready, yet, to, accept, the, vegetarian, diet, the, book, of, daniel, starts, in, its, first, chapter, with, the, benefits, of, vegetarianism, due, to, its, size, its, late, time, of, origin, and, its, revealing, content, the, book, is, of, particular, importance, for, the, time, of, the, following, exile, which, lasts, now, for, 2000, years, and, technically, still, goes, on, until, the, temple, in, jerusalem, is, rebuilt, a, diet, described, as, pulse, and, water, is, presented, along, benefits, such, as, accordance, with, the, biblical, dietary, laws, health, beauty, wisdom, and, vision, vegetarianism, can, be, seen, as, a, safeguard, around, the, dietary, laws, or, the, beautification, of, them, jewish, vegetarianism, and, veganism, have, become, especially, popular, among, israeli, jews, in, 2016, israel, was, described, as, the, most, vegan, country, on, earth, as, five, percent, of, its, population, eschewed, all, animal, products, interest, in, veganism, has, grown, among, both, non, orthodox, and, orthodox, jews, in, israel, within, the, afro, caribbean, community, a, minority, are, rastafari, and, follow, the, dietary, regulations, with, varying, degrees, of, strictness, the, most, orthodox, eat, only, ital, or, natural, foods, in, which, the, matching, of, herbs, or, spices, with, vegetables, is, the, result, of, long, tradition, originating, from, the, african, ancestry, and, cultural, heritage, of, rastafari, ital, which, is, derived, from, the, word, vital, means, essential, to, human, existence, ital, cooking, in, its, strictest, form, prohibits, the, use, of, salt, meat, especially, pork, preservatives, colorings, flavorings, and, anything, artificial, most, rastafari, are, vegetarian, the, tenets, of, sikhism, do, not, advocate, a, particular, stance, on, either, vegetarianism, or, the, consumption, of, meat, but, leave, the, decision, of, diet, to, the, individual, the, tenth, guru, guru, gobind, singh, however, prohibited, amritdhari, sikhs, or, those, that, follow, the, sikh, rehat, maryada, the, official, sikh, code, of, conduct, from, eating, kutha, meat, or, meat, which, has, been, obtained, from, animals, which, have, been, killed, in, a, ritualistic, way, this, is, understood, to, have, been, for, the, political, reason, of, maintaining, independence, from, the, then, new, muslim, hegemony, as, muslims, largely, adhere, to, the, ritualistic, halal, diet, amritdharis, that, belong, to, some, sikh, sects, e, g, akhand, kirtani, jatha, damdami, taksal, namdhari, and, rarionwalay, etc, are, vehemently, against, the, consumption, of, meat, and, eggs, though, they, do, consume, and, encourage, the, consumption, of, milk, butter, and, cheese, this, vegetarian, stance, has, been, traced, back, to, the, times, of, the, british, raj, with, the, advent, of, many, new, vaishnava, converts, in, response, to, the, varying, views, on, diet, throughout, the, sikh, population, sikh, gurus, have, sought, to, clarify, the, sikh, view, on, diet, stressing, their, preference, only, for, simplicity, of, diet, guru, nanak, said, that, over, consumption, of, food, lobh, greed, involves, a, drain, on, the, earth, s, resources, and, thus, on, life, passages, from, the, guru, granth, sahib, the, holy, book, of, sikhs, also, known, as, the, adi, granth, say, that, it, is, foolish, to, argue, for, the, superiority, of, animal, life, because, though, all, life, is, related, only, human, life, carries, more, importance, only, fools, argue, whether, to, eat, meat, or, not, who, can, define, what, is, meat, and, what, is, not, meat, who, knows, where, the, sin, lies, being, a, vegetarian, or, a, non, vegetarian, the, sikh, langar, or, free, temple, meal, is, largely, lacto, vegetarian, though, this, is, understood, to, be, a, result, of, efforts, to, present, a, meal, that, is, respectful, of, the, diets, of, any, person, who, would, wish, to, dine, rather, than, out, of, dogma, environmental, vegetarianism, is, based, on, the, concern, that, the, production, of, meat, and, animal, products, for, mass, consumption, especially, through, factory, farming, is, environmentally, unsustainable, according, to, a, 2006, united, nations, initiative, the, livestock, industry, is, one, of, the, largest, contributors, to, environmental, degradation, worldwide, and, modern, practices, of, raising, animals, for, food, contribute, on, a, massive, scale, to, air, and, water, pollution, land, degradation, climate, change, and, loss, of, biodiversity, the, initiative, concluded, that, the, livestock, sector, emerges, as, one, of, the, top, two, or, three, most, significant, contributors, to, the, most, serious, environmental, problems, at, every, scale, from, local, to, global, in, addition, animal, agriculture, is, a, large, source, of, greenhouse, gases, according, to, a, 2006, report, it, is, responsible, for, 18, of, the, world, s, greenhouse, gas, emissions, as, estimated, in, 100, year, co, 2, equivalents, livestock, sources, including, enteric, fermentation, and, manure, account, for, about, 3, 1, percent, of, us, anthropogenic, ghg, emissions, expressed, as, carbon, dioxide, equivalents, this, epa, estimate, is, based, on, methodologies, agreed, to, by, the, conference, of, parties, of, the, unfccc, with, 100, year, global, warming, potentials, from, the, ipcc, second, assessment, report, used, in, estimating, ghg, emissions, as, carbon, dioxide, equivalents, meat, produced, in, a, laboratory, called, in, vitro, meat, may, be, more, environmentally, sustainable, than, regularly, produced, meat, reactions, of, vegetarians, vary, rearing, a, relatively, small, number, of, grazing, animals, can, be, beneficial, as, the, food, climate, research, network, at, surrey, university, reports, a, little, bit, of, livestock, production, is, probably, a, good, thing, for, the, environment, in, may, 2009, ghent, belgium, was, reported, to, be, the, first, in, the, world, to, go, vegetarian, at, least, once, a, week, for, environmental, reasons, when, local, authorities, decided, to, implement, a, weekly, meatless, day, civil, servants, would, eat, vegetarian, meals, one, day, per, week, in, recognition, of, the, united, nations, report, posters, were, put, up, by, local, authorities, to, encourage, the, population, to, take, part, on, vegetarian, days, and, veggie, street, maps, were, printed, to, highlight, vegetarian, restaurants, in, september, 2009, schools, in, ghent, are, due, to, have, a, weekly, veggiedag, vegetarian, day, too, public, opinion, and, acceptance, of, meat, free, food, is, expected, to, be, more, successful, if, its, descriptive, words, focus, less, on, the, health, aspects, and, more, on, the, flavor, some, groups, such, as, peta, promote, vegetarianism, as, a, way, to, offset, poor, treatment, and, working, conditions, of, workers, in, the, contemporary, meat, industry, these, groups, cite, studies, showing, the, psychological, damage, caused, by, working, in, the, meat, industry, especially, in, factory, and, industrialised, settings, and, argue, that, the, meat, industry, violates, its, labourers, human, rights, by, assigning, difficult, and, distressing, tasks, without, adequate, counselling, training, and, debriefing, however, the, working, conditions, of, agricultural, workers, as, a, whole, particularly, non, permanent, workers, remain, poor, and, well, below, conditions, prevailing, in, other, economic, sectors, accidents, including, pesticide, poisoning, among, farmers, and, plantation, workers, contribute, to, increased, health, risks, including, increased, mortality, according, to, the, international, labour, organization, agriculture, is, one, of, the, three, most, dangerous, jobs, in, the, world, similar, to, environmental, vegetarianism, is, the, concept, of, economic, vegetarianism, an, economic, vegetarian, is, someone, who, practices, vegetarianism, from, either, the, philosophical, viewpoint, concerning, issues, such, as, public, health, and, curbing, world, starvation, the, belief, that, the, consumption, of, meat, is, economically, unsound, part, of, a, conscious, simple, living, strategy, or, just, out, of, necessity, according, to, the, worldwatch, institute, massive, reductions, in, meat, consumption, in, industrial, nations, will, ease, their, health, care, burden, while, improving, public, health, declining, livestock, herds, will, take, pressure, off, rangelands, and, grainlands, allowing, the, agricultural, resource, base, to, rejuvenate, as, populations, grow, lowering, meat, consumption, worldwide, will, allow, more, efficient, use, of, declining, per, capita, land, and, water, resources, while, at, the, same, time, making, grain, more, affordable, to, the, world, s, chronically, hungry, according, to, estimates, in, 2016, adoption, of, vegetarianism, would, contribute, substantially, to, global, healthcare, and, environmental, savings, prejudice, researcher, gordon, hodson, argues, that, vegetarians, and, vegans, frequently, face, discrimination, where, eating, meat, is, held, as, a, cultural, norm, research, suggests, that, at, least, in, the, united, states, vegetarianism, has, a, high, turnover, rate, with, less, than, 20, of, adopters, persisting, for, more, than, a, year, research, shows, that, lacking, social, support, contributes, to, lapses, a, 2019, analysis, found, that, adhering, to, any, kind, of, restricted, diet, gluten, free, vegetarian, kosher, teetotal, was, associated, with, feelings, of, loneliness, and, increased, social, isolation, vegetarians, or, vegans, who, adopted, their, diet, abruptly, might, be, more, likely, to, eventually, abandon, it, when, compared, to, individuals, adopting, their, diet, gradually, with, incremental, changes, the, rate, of, vegetarianism, by, country, varies, substantially, from, relatively, low, levels, in, countries, such, as, the, netherlands, 5, to, more, considerable, levels, in, india, 20, 40, estimates, for, the, number, of, vegetarians, per, country, can, be, subject, to, methodological, difficulties, as, respondents, may, identify, as, vegetarian, even, if, they, include, some, meat, in, their, diet, and, thus, some, researchers, suggest, the, percentage, of, vegetarians, may, be, significantly, overestimated, vegetarianism, is, occasionally, depicted, in, mass, media, some, scholars, have, argued, that, mass, media, serves, as, a, source, of, information, for, individuals, interested, in, vegetarianism, or, veganism, while, there, are, increasing, social, sanctions, against, eating, meat, over, time, societal, attitudes, of, vegetarianism, have, changed, as, have, perceptions, of, vegetarianism, in, popular, culture, leading, to, more, vegetarian, sentiment, even, so, there, are, still, existing, meat, based, food, metaphors, which, infuse, daily, speech, and, those, who, are, vegetarian, and, vegan, are, met, with, acceptance, tolerance, or, hostility, after, they, divulge, they, are, vegetarian, or, vegan, some, writers, such, as, john, l, cunningham, editor, of, the, vegetarian, resource, group, s, newsletter, have, argued, for, more, sympathetic, vegetarian, characters, in, the, mass, media, in, western, literature, vegetarianism, and, topics, that, relate, to, it, have, informed, a, gamut, of, literary, genres, whether, literary, fiction, or, those, fictions, focusing, on, utopias, dystopias, or, apocalypses, with, authors, shaped, by, questions, about, human, identity, and, our, relation, to, the, environment, implicating, vegetarianism, and, veganism, others, have, pointed, to, the, lack, of, memorable, characters, who, are, vegetarian, there, are, also, vegetarian, themes, in, horror, fiction, science, fiction, and, poetry, in, 1818, mary, shelley, published, the, novel, frankenstein, writer, and, animal, rights, advocate, carol, j, adams, argued, in, her, seminal, book, the, sexual, politics, of, meat, that, the, unnamed, creature, in, the, novel, was, a, vegetarian, she, argued, that, the, book, was, indebted, to, the, vegetarian, climate, of, its, day, and, that, vegetarianism, is, a, major, theme, in, the, novel, as, a, whole, she, notes, that, the, creature, gives, an, emotional, speech, talking, about, its, dietary, principles, which, makes, it, a, more, sympathetic, being, than, others, she, also, said, that, it, connected, with, vegetarianism, in, the, romantic, era, who, believed, that, the, garden, of, eden, was, meatless, rewrote, the, myth, of, prometheus, the, ideas, of, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, feminist, symbolism, adams, concludes, that, it, is, more, likely, that, the, vegetarian, revelations, in, the, novel, are, silenced, due, to, the, lack, of, a, framework, into, which, we, can, assimilate, them, apart, from, adams, scholar, suzanne, samples, pointed, to, gendered, spaces, of, eating, and, consumption, within, victorian, england, which, influenced, literary, characters, of, the, time, this, included, works, such, as, alfred, lord, tennyson, s, poem, titled, the, charge, of, the, light, brigade, christina, rossetti, s, volume, of, poetry, titled, goblin, market, and, other, poems, lewis, carroll, s, alice, s, adventures, in, wonderland, mary, seacole, s, autographical, account, titled, wonderful, adventures, of, mrs, seacole, in, many, lands, and, anthony, trollope, s, novel, titled, orley, farm, samples, also, argued, that, vegetarianism, in, the, victorian, era, presented, a, unique, lifestyle, choice, that, avoided, meat, but, promoted, an, awareness, of, health, which, initially, was, seen, as, rebellious, but, later, became, more, normalized, in, irene, clyde, s, 1909, feminist, utopian, novel, beatrice, the, sixteenth, mary, hatherley, accidentally, travels, through, time, discovering, a, lost, world, which, is, a, postgender, society, named, armeria, with, the, inhabitants, following, a, strict, vegetarian, diet, having, ceased, to, slaughter, animals, for, over, a, thousand, years, some, reviewers, of, the, book, praised, the, vegetarianism, of, the, armerians, james, joyce, s, 1922, novel, ulysses, is, said, to, have, vegetarian, themes, scholar, peter, adkins, argued, that, while, joyce, was, critical, of, the, vegetarianism, of, george, a, e, russell, the, novel, engages, with, questions, of, animal, ethics, through, its, portrayal, of, ireland, s, cattle, industry, animal, slaughter, and, the, cultural, currency, of, meat, unlike, some, of, his, other, novels, he, also,
