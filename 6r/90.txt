hot, smoked, chum, salmon, smoking, is, the, process, of, flavoring, browning, cooking, or, preserving, food, by, exposing, it, to, smoke, from, burning, or, smoldering, material, most, often, wood, meat, fish, and, lapsang, souchong, tea, are, often, smoked, in, europe, alder, is, the, traditional, smoking, wood, but, oak, is, more, often, used, now, and, beech, to, a, lesser, extent, in, north, america, hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, alder, maple, and, fruit, tree, woods, such, as, apple, cherry, and, plum, are, commonly, used, for, smoking, other, biomass, besides, wood, can, also, be, employed, sometimes, with, the, addition, of, flavoring, ingredients, chinese, tea, smoking, uses, a, mixture, of, uncooked, rice, sugar, and, tea, heated, at, the, base, of, a, wok, some, north, american, ham, and, bacon, makers, smoke, their, products, over, burning, corncobs, peat, is, burned, to, dry, and, smoke, the, barley, malt, used, to, make, scotch, whisky, and, some, beers, in, new, zealand, sawdust, from, the, native, manuka, tea, tree, is, commonly, used, for, hot, smoking, fish, in, iceland, dried, sheep, dung, is, used, to, cold, smoke, fish, lamb, mutton, and, whale, historically, farms, in, the, western, world, included, a, small, building, termed, the, smokehouse, where, meats, could, be, smoked, and, stored, this, was, generally, well, separated, from, other, buildings, both, because, of, fire, danger, and, smoke, emanations, the, smoking, of, food, may, possibly, introduce, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, which, may, lead, to, an, increased, risk, of, some, types, of, cancer, however, this, association, is, still, being, debated, smoking, can, be, done, in, four, ways, cold, smoking, warm, smoking, hot, smoking, and, through, the, employment, of, a, smoke, flavoring, such, as, liquid, smoke, however, these, methods, of, imparting, smoke, only, affect, the, food, surface, and, are, unable, to, preserve, food, thus, smoking, is, paired, with, other, microbial, hurdles, such, as, chilling, and, packaging, to, extend, food, shelf, life, the, smoking, of, food, likely, dates, back, to, the, paleolithic, era, as, simple, dwellings, lacked, chimneys, these, structures, would, probably, have, become, very, smoky, it, is, supposed, that, early, humans, would, hang, meat, up, to, dry, and, out, of, the, way, of, pests, thus, accidentally, becoming, aware, that, meat, that, was, stored, in, smoky, areas, acquired, a, different, flavor, and, was, better, preserved, than, meat, that, simply, dried, out, this, process, was, later, combined, with, pre, curing, the, food, in, salt, or, salty, brine, resulting, in, a, remarkably, effective, preservation, process, that, was, adapted, and, developed, by, numerous, cultures, around, the, world, until, the, modern, era, smoking, was, of, a, more, heavy, duty, nature, as, the, main, goal, was, to, preserve, the, food, large, quantities, of, salt, were, used, in, the, curing, process, and, smoking, times, were, quite, long, sometimes, involving, days, of, exposure, the, advent, of, modern, transportation, made, it, easier, to, transport, food, products, over, long, distances, and, the, need, for, the, time, and, material, intensive, heavy, salting, and, smoking, declined, smoking, became, more, of, a, way, to, flavor, than, to, preserve, food, in, 1939, a, device, called, the, torry, kiln, was, invented, at, the, torry, research, station, in, scotland, the, kiln, allowed, for, uniform, mass, smoking, and, is, considered, the, prototype, for, all, modern, large, scale, commercial, smokers, although, refinements, in, technique, and, advancements, in, technology, have, made, smoking, much, easier, the, basic, steps, involved, remain, essentially, the, same, today, as, they, were, hundreds, if, not, thousands, of, years, ago, cold, smoking, differs, from, hot, smoking, in, that, it, does, not, cook, anything, when, cold, smoking, is, finished, the, food, is, still, raw, smokehouse, temperatures, for, cold, smoking, are, typically, between, 20, and, 30, c, 68, and, 86, f, in, this, temperature, range, foods, take, on, a, smoked, flavor, but, remain, relatively, moist, since, cold, smoking, does, not, cook, foods, meats, should, be, fully, cured, before, cold, smoking, cold, smoking, can, be, used, as, a, flavor, enhancer, for, items, such, as, cheese, or, nuts, along, with, meats, such, as, chicken, breasts, beef, pork, chops, salmon, scallops, and, steak, the, item, is, often, hung, in, a, dry, environment, first, to, develop, a, pellicle, it, can, then, be, cold, smoked, up, to, several, days, to, ensure, it, absorbs, the, smoke, flavor, some, cold, smoked, foods, are, baked, grilled, steamed, roasted, or, saut, ed, before, eating, cold, smoking, meats, should, not, be, attempted, at, home, according, to, the, us, national, center, for, home, food, preservation, most, food, scientists, cannot, recommend, cold, smoking, methods, because, of, the, inherent, risks, cold, smoking, meats, should, only, be, attempted, by, personnel, certified, in, haccp, to, ensure, that, it, is, safely, prepared, warm, smoking, exposes, foods, to, temperatures, of, 25, 40, c, 77, 104, f, hot, smoking, cooks, foods, and, simultaneously, flavors, them, with, smoke, in, a, controlled, environment, such, as, a, smoker, oven, or, smokehouse, it, requires, consistent, control, of, both, the, temperature, of, the, food, and, the, amount, of, smoke, being, applied, to, it, some, smokers, have, a, heat, source, built, into, them, while, others, use, the, heat, from, a, stove, top, or, oven, like, cold, smoking, the, item, may, be, hung, first, to, develop, a, pellicle, it, is, then, smoked, from, 1, hour, to, as, long, as, 24, hours, although, foods, that, have, been, hot, smoked, are, often, reheated, or, further, cooked, they, are, typically, safe, to, eat, without, further, cooking, the, temperature, range, for, hot, smoking, is, usually, between, 52, and, 80, c, 126, and, 176, f, foods, smoked, in, this, temperature, range, are, usually, fully, cooked, but, still, moist, and, flavorful, at, smoker, temperatures, hotter, than, 85, c, 185, f, foods, can, shrink, excessively, buckle, or, even, split, smoking, at, high, temperatures, also, reduces, yield, as, both, moisture, and, fat, are, cooked, away, liquid, smoke, a, product, derived, from, smoke, compounds, in, water, is, applied, to, foods, through, spraying, or, dipping, smoke, roasting, refers, to, any, process, that, has, the, attributes, of, both, roasting, and, smoking, this, smoking, method, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, barbecuing, or, pit, roasting, it, may, be, done, in, a, smoke, roaster, a, closed, wood, fired, oven, or, a, barbecue, pit, any, smoker, that, can, reach, above, 121, c, 250, f, or, in, a, conventional, oven, by, placing, a, pan, filled, with, hardwood, chips, on, the, floor, of, the, oven, so, that, the, chips, can, smolder, and, produce, a, smoke, bath, in, north, america, this, smoking, method, is, commonly, referred, to, as, barbecuing, pit, baking, or, pit, roasting, hardwoods, are, made, up, mostly, of, three, materials, cellulose, hemicellulose, and, lignin, cellulose, and, hemicellulose, are, the, basic, structural, material, of, the, wood, cells, lignin, acts, as, a, kind, of, cell, bonding, glue, some, softwoods, especially, pines, and, firs, hold, significant, quantities, of, resin, which, produces, a, harsh, tasting, soot, when, burned, these, woods, are, not, often, used, for, smoking, cellulose, and, hemicellulose, are, aggregate, sugar, molecules, when, burnt, they, effectively, caramelize, producing, carbonyls, which, provide, most, of, the, color, components, and, sweet, flowery, and, fruity, aromas, lignin, a, highly, complex, arrangement, of, interlocked, phenolic, molecules, also, produces, a, number, of, distinctive, aromatic, elements, when, burnt, including, smoky, spicy, and, pungent, compounds, such, as, guaiacol, phenol, and, syringol, and, sweeter, scents, such, as, the, vanilla, scented, vanillin, and, clove, like, isoeugenol, guaiacol, is, the, phenolic, compound, most, responsible, for, the, smoky, taste, while, syringol, is, the, primary, contributor, to, smoky, aroma, wood, also, contains, small, quantities, of, proteins, which, contribute, roasted, flavors, many, of, the, odor, compounds, in, wood, smoke, especially, the, phenolic, compounds, are, unstable, dissipating, after, a, few, weeks, or, months, a, number, of, wood, smoke, compounds, act, as, preservatives, phenol, and, other, phenolic, compounds, in, wood, smoke, are, both, antioxidants, which, slow, rancidification, of, animal, fats, and, antimicrobials, which, slow, bacterial, growth, other, antimicrobials, in, wood, smoke, include, formaldehyde, acetic, acid, and, other, organic, acids, which, give, wood, smoke, a, low, ph, about, 2, 5, some, of, these, compounds, are, toxic, to, people, as, well, and, may, have, health, effects, in, the, quantities, found, in, cooking, applications, since, different, species, of, trees, have, different, ratios, of, components, various, types, of, wood, do, impart, a, different, flavor, to, food, another, important, factor, is, the, temperature, at, which, the, wood, burns, high, temperature, fires, see, the, flavor, molecules, broken, down, further, into, unpleasant, or, flavorless, compounds, the, optimal, conditions, for, smoke, flavor, are, low, smoldering, temperatures, between, 300, and, 400, c, 570, and, 750, f, this, is, the, temperature, of, the, burning, wood, itself, not, of, the, smoking, environment, which, uses, much, lower, temperatures, woods, that, are, high, in, lignin, content, tend, to, burn, hot, to, keep, them, smoldering, requires, restricted, oxygen, supplies, or, a, high, moisture, content, when, smoking, using, wood, chips, or, chunks, the, combustion, temperature, is, often, raised, by, soaking, the, pieces, in, water, before, placing, them, on, a, fire, the, main, characteristics, of, the, offset, smoker, are, that, the, cooking, chamber, is, usually, cylindrical, in, shape, with, a, shorter, smaller, diameter, cylinder, attached, to, the, bottom, of, one, end, for, a, firebox, to, cook, the, meat, a, small, fire, is, lit, in, the, firebox, where, airflow, is, tightly, controlled, the, heat, and, smoke, from, the, fire, are, drawn, through, a, connecting, pipe, or, opening, into, the, cooking, chamber, the, heat, and, smoke, cook, and, flavor, the, meat, before, escaping, through, an, exhaust, vent, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, cooking, chamber, most, manufacturers, models, are, based, on, this, simple, but, effective, design, and, this, is, what, most, people, picture, when, they, think, of, a, bbq, smoker, even, large, capacity, commercial, units, use, this, same, basic, design, of, a, separate, smaller, fire, box, and, a, larger, cooking, chamber, the, upright, drum, smoker, also, referred, to, as, an, ugly, drum, smoker, or, uds, is, exactly, what, its, name, suggests, an, upright, steel, drum, that, has, been, modified, for, the, purpose, of, pseudo, indirect, hot, smoking, there, are, many, ways, to, accomplish, this, but, the, basics, include, the, use, of, a, complete, steel, drum, a, basket, to, hold, charcoal, near, the, bottom, and, a, cooking, rack, or, racks, near, the, top, all, covered, by, a, vented, lid, of, some, sort, these, smokers, have, been, built, using, many, different, sizes, of, steel, drums, such, as, 30, us, gallons, 110, l, 25, imp, gal, 55, us, gallons, 210, l, 46, imp, gal, and, 85, us, gallons, 320, l, 71, imp, gal, but, the, most, popular, size, is, the, common, 55, gallon, drum, this, design, is, similar, to, smoking, with, indirect, heat, due, to, the, distance, between, the, coals, and, the, cooking, racks, which, is, typically, 24, inches, 61, cm, the, temperature, is, controlled, by, limiting, the, air, intake, at, the, bottom, of, the, drum, and, allowing, a, similar, amount, of, exhaust, out, of, vents, in, the, lid, udss, use, their, fuel, very, efficiently, and, are, flexible, in, their, ability, to, produce, proper, smoking, conditions, with, or, without, the, use, of, a, water, pan, or, drip, pan, a, vertical, water, smoker, also, referred, to, as, a, bullet, smoker, because, of, its, shape, is, a, variation, of, the, upright, drum, smoker, it, uses, charcoal, or, wood, to, generate, smoke, and, heat, and, contains, a, water, bowl, between, the, fire, and, the, cooking, grates, the, water, bowl, serves, to, maintain, optimal, smoking, temperatures, and, also, adds, humidity, to, the, smoke, chamber, it, also, creates, an, effect, in, which, the, water, vapor, and, smoke, condense, together, which, adds, flavor, to, smoked, foods, in, addition, the, bowl, catches, any, drippings, from, the, meat, that, may, cause, a, flare, up, vertical, water, smokers, are, extremely, temperature, stable, and, require, very, little, adjustment, once, the, desired, temperature, has, been, reached, because, of, their, relatively, low, cost, and, stable, temperature, they, are, sometimes, used, in, barbecue, competitions, where, propane, and, electric, smokers, are, not, allowed, a, propane, smoker, is, designed, to, allow, the, smoking, of, meat, in, a, somewhat, more, temperature, controlled, environment, the, primary, differences, are, the, sources, of, heat, and, of, the, smoke, in, a, propane, smoker, the, heat, is, generated, by, a, gas, burner, directly, under, a, steel, or, iron, box, containing, the, wood, or, charcoal, that, provides, the, smoke, the, steel, box, has, few, vent, holes, on, the, top, of, the, box, only, by, starving, the, heated, wood, of, oxygen, it, smokes, instead, of, burning, any, combination, of, woods, and, charcoal, may, used, this, method, uses, much, less, wood, but, does, require, propane, fuel, this, more, traditional, method, uses, a, two, box, system, a, fire, box, and, a, food, box, the, fire, box, is, typically, adjacent, or, under, the, cooking, box, and, can, be, controlled, to, a, finer, degree, the, heat, and, smoke, from, the, fire, box, exhausts, into, the, food, box, where, it, is, used, to, cook, and, smoke, the, meat, these, may, be, as, simple, as, an, electric, heating, element, with, a, pan, of, wood, chips, placed, on, it, although, more, advanced, models, have, finer, temperature, controls, the, most, convenient, of, the, various, types, of, smokers, are, the, insulated, electric, smokers, these, devices, house, a, heating, element, that, can, maintain, temperatures, ranging, from, that, required, for, a, cold, smoke, all, the, way, up, to, 135, c, 275, f, with, little, to, no, intervention, from, the, user, although, wood, chunks, pellets, and, even, in, some, cases, automatically, fed, wood, pucks, are, used, to, generate, smoke, the, amount, of, flavor, obtained, is, less, than, traditional, wood, or, charcoal, smokers, in, this, method, the, firebox, is, a, narrow, trench, cut, down, a, slope, pointing, into, the, prevailing, wind, the, middle, part, of, the, trench, is, covered, over, to, make, it, into, a, tunnel, at, the, upper, end, of, the, trench, is, a, vertical, framework, covered, to, form, a, chimney, within, which, is, placed, the, rack, of, foodstuff, at, the, lower, upwind, end, of, the, trench, is, lit, a, small, smokey, fire, and, sustained, day, and, night, until, the, foodstuff, is, cured, commercial, smokehouses, mostly, made, from, stainless, steel, have, independent, systems, for, smoke, generation, and, cooking, smoke, generators, use, friction, an, electric, coil, or, a, small, flame, to, ignite, sawdust, on, demand, heat, from, steam, coils, or, gas, flames, is, balanced, with, live, steam, or, water, sprays, to, control, the, temperature, and, humidity, elaborate, air, handling, systems, reduce, hot, or, cold, spots, to, reduce, variation, in, the, finished, product, racks, on, wheels, or, rails, are, used, to, hold, the, product, and, facilitate, movement, a, pellet, smoker, is, a, temperature, controlled, smoker, that, burns, wood, pellets, made, of, dried, out, sawdust, about, an, inch, long, and, 1, 4, inch, wide, the, wood, pellets, are, stored, in, a, gravity, fed, hopper, that, feeds, into, a, motor, controlled, auger, by, the, temperature, regulator, this, auger, pushes, the, pellets, into, the, fire, pot, an, ignition, rod, within, the, auger, ignites, the, pellets, where, a, combustion, fan, keeps, them, smouldering, the, motor, and, the, combustion, fan, regulate, the, temperature, of, the, smoker, by, feeding, it, more, pellets, and, increasing, airflow, in, the, auger, above, the, auger, is, a, heat, shield, to, disperse, the, direct, heat, before, it, reaches, the, heat, box, to, allow, the, wood, smoke, to, keep, the, heat, box, at, an, even, temperature, throughout, the, heat, sensor, inside, the, heat, box, relays, the, current, temperature, inside, the, box, back, to, the, temperature, regulator, that, controls, the, fan, speed, and, pellet, hopper, motor, which, either, increase, or, decrease, the, amount, of, pellets, in, the, auger, or, the, amount, of, air, available, to, the, fire, to, maintain, the, desired, temperature, for, the, cook, the, popularity, of, this, type, of, smoker, is, on, the, rise, after, many, bbq, pit, masters, began, using, them, in, barbecue, competitions, smoke, is, both, an, antimicrobial, and, antioxidant, but, it, is, insufficient, for, preserving, food, because, it, does, not, penetrate, far, into, meat, or, fish, therefore, if, the, food, is, to, be, preserved, smoking, is, typically, combined, with, salt, curing, or, drying, smoking, is, especially, useful, for, oily, fish, as, its, antioxidant, properties, inhibit, surface, fat, rancidification, and, delay, oxygen, from, reaching, the, interior, fat, and, degrading, it, some, heavily, salted, long, smoked, fish, can, keep, without, refrigeration, for, weeks, or, months, artificial, smoke, flavoring, such, as, liquid, smoke, can, be, purchased, to, mimic, smoking, s, flavor, but, such, products, have, no, preservative, qualities, competitive, bbq, smoking, is, becoming, increasingly, popular, especially, in, the, southern, united, states, where, bbq, enthusiasts, come, together, over, a, weekend, to, cook, various, cuts, of, meat, such, as, a, whole, hog, or, a, beef, brisket, organisations, such, as, kansas, city, barbeque, society, run, competitions, all, over, america, regularly, consuming, smoked, meats, and, fish, may, increase, the, risk, of, several, types, of, cancer, some, of, the, more, common, smoked, foods, and, beverages, include
