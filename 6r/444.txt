mountain, biking, abbr, mtb, is, a, sport, of, riding, bicycles, off, road, often, over, rough, terrain, usually, using, specially, designed, mountain, bikes, mountain, bikes, share, similarities, with, other, bikes, but, incorporate, features, designed, to, enhance, durability, and, performance, in, rough, terrain, such, as, air, or, coil, sprung, shocks, used, as, suspension, larger, and, wider, wheels, and, tires, stronger, frame, materials, and, mechanically, or, hydraulically, actuated, disc, brakes, mountain, biking, can, generally, be, broken, down, into, distinct, categories, cross, country, trail, all, mountain, enduro, downhill, and, freeride, the, sport, requires, endurance, core, and, back, strength, balance, bike, handling, skills, and, self, reliance, advanced, riders, pursue, both, steep, technical, descents, and, high, incline, climbs, in, the, case, of, freeride, downhill, and, dirt, jumping, aerial, maneuvers, are, performed, off, both, natural, features, and, specially, constructed, jumps, and, ramps, mountain, bikers, ride, on, off, road, trails, such, as, singletrack, back, country, roads, wider, bike, park, trails, fire, roads, and, some, advanced, trails, are, designed, with, jumps, berms, and, drop, offs, to, add, excitement, to, the, trail, riders, with, enduro, and, downhill, bikes, will, often, visit, ski, resorts, that, stay, open, in, the, summer, to, ride, downhill, specific, trails, using, the, ski, lifts, to, return, to, the, top, with, their, bikes, because, riders, are, often, far, from, civilization, there, is, a, strong, element, of, self, reliance, in, the, sport, riders, learn, to, repair, broken, bikes, and, flat, tires, to, avoid, being, stranded, many, riders, carry, a, backpack, including, water, food, tools, for, trailside, repairs, and, a, first, aid, kit, in, case, of, injury, group, rides, are, common, especially, on, longer, treks, mountain, bike, orienteering, adds, the, skill, of, map, navigation, to, mountain, biking, one, of, the, first, examples, of, bicycles, modified, specifically, for, off, road, use, is, the, expedition, of, buffalo, soldiers, from, missoula, montana, to, yellowstone, in, august, 1896, bicycles, were, ridden, off, road, by, road, racing, cyclists, who, used, cyclocross, as, a, means, of, keeping, fit, during, the, winter, cyclo, cross, eventually, became, a, sport, in, its, own, right, in, the, 1940s, with, the, first, world, championship, taking, place, in, 1950, the, rough, stuff, fellowship, was, established, in, 1955, by, off, road, cyclists, in, the, united, kingdom, in, oregon, in, 1966, one, chemeketan, club, member, d, gwynn, built, a, rough, terrain, trail, bicycle, he, named, it, a, mountain, bicycle, for, its, intended, place, of, use, this, may, be, the, first, use, of, that, name, in, england, in, 1968, geoff, apps, a, motorbike, trials, rider, began, experimenting, with, off, road, bicycle, designs, by, 1979, he, had, developed, a, custom, built, lightweight, bicycle, which, was, uniquely, suited, to, the, wet, and, muddy, off, road, conditions, found, in, the, south, east, of, england, they, were, designed, around, 2, inch, 650b, nokian, snow, tires, though, a, 700x47c, 28, in, version, was, also, produced, these, were, sold, under, the, cleland, cycles, brand, until, late, 1984, bikes, based, on, the, cleland, design, were, also, sold, by, english, cycles, and, highpath, engineering, until, the, early, 1990s, there, were, several, groups, of, riders, in, different, areas, of, the, u, s, a, who, can, make, valid, claims, to, playing, a, part, in, the, birth, of, the, sport, riders, in, marin, county, california, and, crested, butte, colorado, tinkered, with, bikes, and, adapted, them, to, the, rigors, of, off, road, riding, modified, heavy, cruiser, bicycles, old, 1930s, and, 40s, schwinn, bicycles, retrofitted, with, better, brakes, and, fat, tires, were, used, for, freewheeling, down, mountain, trails, in, marin, in, the, late, 1960s, to, late, 1970s, at, the, time, the, bikes, were, comparatively, primitive, with, single, speed, coaster, brakes, the, earliest, ancestors, of, modern, mountain, bikes, were, based, around, frames, made, by, schwinn, colson, and, others, the, schwinn, excelsior, was, the, frame, of, choice, due, to, its, geometry, these, early, bikes, were, eventually, modified, with, multi, speed, gearing, drum, or, rim, brakes, and, motocross, or, bmx, style, handlebars, creating, klunkers, the, term, would, also, be, used, as, a, verb, since, the, term, mountain, biking, was, not, yet, in, use, the, first, person, known, to, fit, multiple, speeds, and, drum, brakes, to, a, klunker, is, russ, mahon, of, cupertino, california, who, used, the, resulting, bike, in, cyclo, cross, racing, early, downhill, racing, on, mountain, fire, roads, caused, lesser, branded, coaster, brakes, to, burn, the, grease, inside, requiring, the, riders, to, repack, the, bearings, after, each, race, the, first, organized, series, of, downhill, races, in, fairfax, california, known, as, repack, races, triggered, early, innovations, in, mountain, bike, technology, as, well, as, the, initial, exposure, of, the, sport, to, a, nation, wide, audience, through, tv, media, s, evening, magazine, the, fire, road, unofficially, named, repack, still, exists, and, is, rideable, the, sport, originated, in, california, on, marin, county, s, mount, tamalpais, it, was, not, until, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, that, road, bicycle, companies, started, to, manufacture, mountain, bicycles, using, high, tech, lightweight, materials, joe, breeze, is, normally, credited, with, introducing, the, first, purpose, built, mountain, bike, in, 1978, tom, ritchey, then, went, on, to, make, frames, for, a, company, called, mountainbikes, a, partnership, between, gary, fisher, charlie, kelly, and, tom, ritchey, tom, ritchey, a, welder, with, skills, in, frame, building, also, built, the, original, bikes, the, company, s, three, partners, eventually, dissolved, their, partnership, and, the, company, became, fisher, mountain, bikes, while, tom, ritchey, started, his, own, frame, shop, the, first, mountain, bikes, were, basically, road, bicycle, frames, with, heavier, tubing, and, different, geometry, with, a, wider, frame, and, fork, to, allow, for, a, wider, tire, the, handlebars, were, also, different, in, that, they, were, a, straight, transverse, mounted, handlebar, rather, than, the, dropped, curved, handlebars, that, are, typically, installed, on, road, racing, bicycles, also, some, of, the, parts, on, early, production, mountain, bicycles, were, taken, from, the, bmx, bicycle, other, contributors, were, otis, guy, and, keith, bontrager, tom, ritchey, built, the, first, regularly, available, mountain, bike, frame, which, was, accessorized, by, gary, fisher, and, charlie, kelly, and, sold, by, their, company, called, mountainbikes, later, changed, to, fisher, mountain, bikes, then, bought, by, trek, still, under, the, name, gary, fisher, currently, sold, as, trek, s, gary, fisher, collection, the, first, two, mass, produced, mountain, bikes, were, sold, in, the, early, 1980s, the, specialized, stumpjumper, and, univega, alpina, pro, in, 1988, the, great, mountain, biking, video, was, released, soon, followed, by, others, in, 2007, klunkerz, a, film, about, mountain, bikes, was, released, documenting, mountain, bike, history, during, the, formative, period, in, northern, california, additionally, a, group, of, mountain, bikers, called, the, laguna, rads, formed, a, club, during, the, mid, eighties, and, began, a, weekly, ride, exploring, the, uncharted, coastal, hillsides, of, laguna, beach, california, industry, insiders, suggest, that, this, was, the, birth, of, the, freeride, movement, as, they, were, cycling, up, and, down, hills, and, mountains, where, no, cycling, specific, trail, network, prexisted, the, laguna, rads, have, also, held, the, longest, running, downhill, race, once, a, year, since, 1986, at, the, time, the, bicycle, industry, was, not, impressed, with, the, mountain, bike, regarding, mountain, biking, to, be, short, term, fad, in, particular, large, manufacturers, such, as, schwinn, and, fuji, failed, to, see, the, significance, of, an, all, terrain, bicycle, and, the, coming, boom, in, adventure, sports, instead, the, first, mass, produced, mountain, bikes, were, pioneered, by, new, companies, such, as, mountainbikes, later, fisher, mountain, bikes, ritchey, and, specialized, specialized, was, an, american, startup, company, that, arranged, for, production, of, mountain, bike, frames, from, factories, in, japan, and, taiwan, first, marketed, in, 1981, specialized, s, mountain, bike, largely, followed, tom, ritchey, s, frame, geometry, but, used, tig, welding, to, join, the, frame, tubes, instead, of, fillet, brazing, a, process, better, suited, to, mass, production, and, which, helped, to, reduce, labor, and, manufacturing, cost, the, bikes, were, configured, with, 15, gears, using, derailleurs, a, triple, chainring, and, a, cogset, with, five, sprockets, throughout, the, 1990s, and, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, mountain, biking, moved, from, a, little, known, sport, to, a, mainstream, activity, mountain, bikes, and, mountain, bike, gear, once, only, available, at, specialty, shops, or, via, mail, order, became, available, at, standard, bike, stores, by, the, mid, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, even, some, department, stores, began, selling, inexpensive, mountain, bikes, with, full, suspension, and, disc, brakes, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, trends, in, mountain, bikes, included, the, all, mountain, bike, the, 29er, and, the, one, by, drivetrain, though, the, first, mass, produced, 1x, drivetrain, was, sram, s, xx1, in, 2012, all, mountain, bikes, were, designed, to, descend, and, handle, well, in, rough, conditions, while, still, pedaling, efficiently, for, climbing, and, were, intended, to, bridge, the, gap, between, cross, country, bikes, and, those, built, specifically, for, downhill, riding, they, are, characterized, by, 4, 6, inches, 100, 150, millimetres, of, fork, travel, 29er, bikes, are, those, using, 700c, sized, rims, as, do, most, road, bikes, but, wider, and, suited, for, tires, of, two, inches, 50, mm, width, or, more, the, increased, diameter, wheel, is, able, to, roll, over, obstacles, better, and, offers, a, greater, tire, contact, patch, but, also, results, in, a, longer, wheelbase, making, the, bike, less, agile, and, in, less, travel, space, for, the, suspension, the, single, speed, is, considered, a, return, to, simplicity, with, no, drivetrain, components, or, shifters, but, thus, requires, a, stronger, rider, following, the, growing, trend, in, 29, inch, wheels, there, have, been, other, trends, in, the, mountain, biking, community, involving, tire, size, some, riders, prefer, to, have, a, larger, wheel, in, the, front, than, on, the, rear, such, as, on, a, motorcycle, to, increase, maneuverability, this, is, called, a, mullet, bicycle, most, common, with, a, 29, inch, wheel, in, the, front, and, a, 27, 5, inch, wheel, in, the, back, another, interesting, trend, in, mountain, bikes, is, outfitting, dirt, jump, or, urban, bikes, with, rigid, forks, these, bikes, normally, use, 4, 5, travel, suspension, forks, the, resulting, product, is, used, for, the, same, purposes, as, the, original, bike, a, commonly, cited, reason, for, making, the, change, to, a, rigid, fork, is, the, enhancement, of, the, rider, s, ability, to, transmit, force, to, the, ground, which, is, important, for, performing, tricks, in, the, mid, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, an, increasing, number, of, mountain, bike, oriented, resorts, opened, often, they, are, similar, to, or, in, the, same, complex, as, a, ski, resort, or, they, retrofit, the, concrete, steps, and, platforms, of, an, abandoned, factory, as, an, obstacle, course, as, with, ray, s, mtb, indoor, park, mountain, bike, parks, which, are, operated, as, summer, season, activities, at, ski, hills, usually, include, chairlifts, that, are, adapted, to, bikes, a, number, of, trails, of, varying, difficulty, and, bicycle, rental, facilities, in, 2020, due, to, covid, 19, mountain, bikes, saw, a, surge, in, popularity, in, the, us, with, some, vendors, reporting, that, they, were, sold, out, of, bikes, under, us, 1000, the, level, of, protection, worn, by, individual, riders, varies, greatly, and, is, affected, by, speed, trail, conditions, the, weather, and, numerous, other, factors, including, personal, choice, protection, becomes, more, important, where, these, factors, may, be, considered, to, increase, the, possibility, or, severity, of, a, crash, a, helmet, and, gloves, are, usually, regarded, as, sufficient, for, the, majority, of, non, technical, riding, full, face, helmets, goggles, and, armored, suits, or, jackets, are, frequently, used, in, downhill, mountain, biking, where, the, extra, bulk, and, weight, may, help, mitigate, the, risks, of, bigger, and, more, frequent, crashes, protective, gear, cannot, provide, immunity, against, injuries, for, example, concussions, can, still, occur, despite, the, use, of, helmets, and, spinal, injuries, can, still, occur, with, the, use, of, spinal, padding, and, neck, braces, the, use, of, high, tech, protective, gear, can, result, in, a, revenge, effect, whereupon, some, cyclists, feel, safe, taking, dangerous, risks, because, the, key, determinant, of, injury, risk, is, kinetic, energy, and, because, kinetic, energy, increases, with, the, square, of, the, speed, effectively, each, doubling, of, speed, can, quadruple, the, injury, risk, similarly, each, tripling, of, speed, can, be, expected, to, bring, a, nine, fold, increase, in, risk, and, each, quadrupling, of, speed, means, that, a, sixteen, fold, risk, increase, must, be, anticipated, higher, speeds, of, travel, also, add, danger, due, to, reaction, time, because, higher, speeds, mean, that, the, rider, travels, further, during, their, reaction, time, this, leaves, less, travel, distance, within, which, to, react, safely, this, in, turn, further, multiplies, the, risk, of, an, injurious, crash, in, general, although, protective, gear, cannot, always, prevent, the, occurrence, of, injuries, the, use, of, such, equipment, is, appropriate, as, is, maintaining, it, in, serviceable, condition, because, mountain, biking, takes, place, outdoors, ultraviolet, radiation, from, sunlight, is, present, and, uv, rays, are, known, to, degrade, plastic, components, accordingly, and, as, a, rule, of, thumb, a, bicycle, helmet, should, be, replaced, every, five, years, or, sooner, if, it, appears, damaged, additionally, if, the, helmet, has, been, involved, in, an, accident, or, has, otherwise, incurred, impact, type, damage, then, it, should, be, replaced, promptly, even, if, it, does, not, appear, to, be, visibly, damaged, cross, country, xc, generally, means, riding, point, to, point, or, in, a, loop, including, climbs, and, descents, on, a, variety, of, terrain, a, typical, xc, bike, weighs, around, 9, 13, kilos, 20, 30, lbs, and, has, 0, 125, millimeters, 0, 0, 4, 9, inches, of, suspension, travel, front, and, sometimes, rear, cross, country, mountain, biking, focuses, on, physical, strength, and, endurance, more, than, the, other, forms, which, require, greater, technical, skill, cross, country, mountain, biking, is, the, only, mountain, biking, discipline, in, the, summer, olympic, games, trail, bikes, typically, have, front, suspension, travel, of, 120, 130mm, mostly, used, for, recreation, not, formal, competitions, all, mountain, bikes, typically, have, front, suspension, travel, of, 140, 150mm, they, are, less, focused, on, speed, and, stability, when, riding, down, hills, than, enduro, bikes, thereby, increasing, efficiency, when, riding, up, hills, enduro, bikes, tend, to, have, moderate, travel, suspension, systems, and, components, which, are, stronger, than, xc, models, typically, 160, 180, mm, of, travel, on, a, full, suspension, frame, but, at, a, weight, that, is, suitable, for, both, climbing, and, descending, enduro, racing, includes, elements, of, dh, racing, but, enduro, races, are, much, longer, sometimes, taking, a, full, day, to, complete, and, incorporate, climbing, sections, to, connect, the, timed, downhill, descents, often, referred, to, as, stages, typically, there, is, a, maximum, time, limit, for, how, long, a, rider, takes, to, reach, the, top, of, each, climb, while, finishers, of, the, downhill, portions, are, ranked, by, fastest, times, historically, many, long, distance, xc, races, would, use, the, descriptor, enduro, in, their, race, names, to, indicate, their, endurance, aspect, some, long, standing, race, events, have, maintained, this, custom, sometimes, leading, to, confusion, with, the, modern, enduro, format, that, has, been, adopted, to, the, enduro, world, series, enduro, racing, was, commonly, seen, as, a, race, for, all, abilities, while, there, are, many, recreational, riders, that, do, compete, in, enduro, races, the, sport, is, increasingly, attracting, high, level, riders, such, as, sam, hill, or, isabeau, courdurier, downhill, dh, is, in, the, most, general, sense, riding, mountain, bikes, downhill, courses, include, large, jumps, up, to, and, including, 12, meters, 39, feet, drops, of, 3, meters, 10, feet, and, are, generally, rough, and, steep, from, top, to, bottom, the, rider, commonly, travels, to, the, point, of, descent, by, other, means, than, cycling, such, as, a, ski, lift, or, automobile, as, the, weight, of, the, downhill, mountain, bike, often, precludes, any, serious, climbing, because, of, the, extremely, steep, terrain, often, located, in, summer, at, ski, resorts, downhill, mountain, biking, is, one, of, the, most, extreme, and, dangerous, cycling, disciplines, minimum, body, protection, in, a, true, downhill, setting, entails, wearing, knee, pads, and, a, full, face, helmet, with, goggles, albeit, riders, and, racers, commonly, wear, various, forms, of, full, body, suits, that, include, padding, at, selected, locations, downhill, specific, bikes, are, universally, equipped, with, front, and, rear, suspension, large, disc, brakes, and, use, heavier, frame, tubing, than, other, mountain, bikes, downhill, bicycles, now, weigh, around, 16, 20, kg, 35, 44, lb, while, the, most, expensive, professional, downhill, mountain, bikes, can, weigh, as, little, as, 15, kilograms, 33, pounds, fully, equipped, with, custom, carbon, fiber, parts, air, suspension, tubeless, tires, and, more, downhill, frames, have, anywhere, from, 170, 250, millimeters, 6, 7, 9, 8, inches, of, travel, and, are, usually, equipped, with, a, 200, millimeters, 7, 9, inches, travel, dual, crown, fork, four, cross, dual, slalom, 4x, is, a, discipline, in, which, riders, compete, either, on, separate, tracks, as, in, dual, slalom, or, on, a, short, slalom, track, as, in, 4x, most, bikes, used, are, light, hard, tails, although, the, last, world, cup, was, actually, won, on, a, full, suspension, bike, the, track, is, downhill, and, has, dirt, jumps, berms, and, gaps, professionals, in, gravity, mountain, biking, tend, to, concentrate, either, on, downhill, mountain, biking, or, 4x, dual, slalom, because, they, are, very, different, however, some, riders, such, as, cedric, gracia, used, to, compete, in, both, 4x, and, dh, although, that, is, becoming, more, rare, as, 4x, takes, on, its, own, identity, freeride, big, hit, hucking, as, the, name, suggests, is, a, do, anything, discipline, that, encompasses, everything, from, downhill, racing, without, the, clock, to, jumping, riding, north, shore, style, elevated, trails, made, of, interconnecting, bridges, and, logs, and, generally, riding, trails, and, or, stunts, that, require, more, skill, and, aggressive, techniques, than, xc, slopestyle, type, riding, is, an, increasingly, popular, genre, that, combines, big, air, stunt, ridden, freeride, with, bmx, style, tricks, slopestyle, courses, are, usually, constructed, at, already, established, mountain, bike, parks, and, include, jumps, large, drops, quarter, pipes, and, other, wooden, obstacles, there, are, always, multiple, lines, through, a, course, and, riders, compete, for, judges, points, by, choosing, lines, that, highlight, their, particular, skills, a, typical, freeride, bike, is, hard, to, define, but, typical, specifications, are, 13, 18, kilos, 30, 40, lbs, with, 150, 250, millimeters, 5, 9, 9, 8, inches, of, suspension, front, and, rear, freeride, bikes, are, generally, heavier, and, more, amply, suspended, than, their, xc, counterparts, but, usually, retain, much, of, their, climbing, ability, it, is, up, to, the, rider, to, build, his, or, her, bike, to, lean, more, toward, a, preferred, level, of, aggressiveness, dirt, jumping, dj, is, the, practice, of, riding, bikes, over, shaped, mounds, of, dirt, or, soil, and, becoming, airborne, the, goal, is, that, after, riding, over, the, lip, the, rider, will, become, airborne, and, aim, to, land, on, the, knuckle, dirt, jumping, can, be, done, on, almost, any, bicycle, but, the, bikes, chosen, are, generally, smaller, and, more, maneuverable, hardtails, so, that, tricks, such, as, backflips, whips, and, tabletops, are, easier, to, complete, the, bikes, are, simpler, so, that, when, a, crash, occurs, there, are, fewer, components, to, break, or, cause, the, rider, injury, bikes, are, typically, built, from, sturdier, materials, such, as, steel, to, handle, repeated, heavy, impacts, of, crashes, and, bails, trials, riding, consists, of, hopping, and, jumping, bikes, over, obstacles, without, touching, a, foot, onto, the, ground, it, can, be, performed, either, off, road, or, in, an, urban, environment, this, requires, an, excellent, sense, of, balance, the, emphasis, is, placed, on, techniques, of, effectively, overcoming, the, obstacles, although, street, trials, as, opposed, to, competition, oriented, trials, is, much, like, street, and, dj, where, doing, tricks, with, style, is, the, essence, trials, bikes, look, almost, nothing, like, mountain, bikes, they, use, either, 20, 24, or, 26, wheels, and, have, very, small, low, frames, some, types, without, a, saddle, urban, street, is, essentially, the, same, as, urban, bmx, or, freestyle, bmx, in, which, riders, perform, tricks, by, riding, on, over, man, made, objects, the, bikes, are, the, same, as, those, used, for, dirt, jumping, having, 24, or, 26, wheels, also, they, are, very, light, many, in, the, range, of, 25, 30, lb, 11, 14, kg, and, are, typically, hardtails, with, between, 0, 100, millimeters, of, the, front, suspension, as, with, dirt, jumping, and, trials, style, and, execution, are, emphasized, trail, riding, or, trail, biking, is, a, varied, and, popular, non, competitive, form, of, mountain, biking, on, recognized, and, often, waymarked, and, graded, trails, unpaved, tracks, forest, paths, etc, trails, may, take, the, form, of, single, routes, or, part, of, a, larger, complex, known, as, trail, centers, trail, difficulty, typically, varies, from, gentle, family, trails, green, through, routes, with, increasingly, technical, features, blue, and, red, to, those, requiring, high, levels, of, fitness, and, skill, black, incorporating, demanding, ascents, with, steep, technical, descents, comparable, to, less, extreme, downhill, routes, as, difficulty, increases, trails, incorporate, more, technical, trail, features, such, as, berms, rock, gardens, uneven, surfaces, drop, offs, and, jumps, the, most, basic, of, bike, designs, can, be, used, for, less, severe, trails, but, there, are, trail, bike, designs, which, balance, climbing, ability, with, good, downhill, performance, almost, always, having, 120, 150, mm, of, travel, on, a, suspension, fork, with, either, a, hard, tail, or, a, similar, travel, rear, suspension, many, more, technical, trails, are, also, used, as, routes, for, cross, country, enduro, and, even, downhill, racing, mountain, bike, touring, or, marathon, is, long, distance, touring, on, dirt, roads, and, single, track, with, a, mountain, bike, with, the, popularity, of, the, great, divide, trail, the, colorado, trail, and, other, long, distance, off, road, biking, trails, specially, outfitted, mountain, bikes, are, increasingly, being, used, for, touring, bike, manufacturers, like, salsa, have, even, developed, mtb, touring, bikes, like, the, fargo, model, mixed, terrain, cycle, touring, or, rough, riding, is, a, form, of, mountain, bike, touring, but, involves, cycling, over, a, variety, of, surfaces, and, topography, on, a, single, route, with, a, single, bicycle, that, is, expected, to, be, satisfactory, for, all, segments, the, recent, surge, in, popularity, of, mixed, terrain, touring, is, in, part, a, reaction, against, the, increasing, specialization, of, the, bicycle, industry, mixed, terrain, bicycle, travel, has, a, storied, history, of, focusing, on, efficiency, cost, effectiveness, and, freedom, of, travel, over, varied, surfaces, bikepacking, is, a, self, supported, style, of, lightly, loaded, single, or, multiple, night, mountain, biking, bikepacking, is, similar, to, bike, touring, however, the, two, sports, generally, use, different, bikes, and, the, main, difference, is, the, method, of, carrying, gear, bikepacking, generally, involves, carrying, less, gear, and, using, smaller, frame, bags, while, bike, touring, will, use, panniers, a, typical, bikepacking, set, up, includes, a, frame, bag, handlebar, roll, seat, pack, and, backpack, and, typical, gear, includes, lightweight, and, basic, camping, gear, and, a, bike, repair, kit, mountain, bikes, are, generally, used, as, many, bike, packing, destinations, are, reached, via, forest, service, roads, or, singletrack, trails, mountain, bikes, specific, to, bike, packing, use, a, slightly, taller, frame, to, get, the, maximum, frame, bag, capacity, this, is, achieved, by, using, a, longer, headtube, a, more, horizontal, top, tube, and, a, reduced, stem, degree, generally, bikepackers, tend, to, cover, anywhere, from, 25, to, 75, miles, 40, 120, km, in, a, given, day, as, the, riding, can, be, technical, cycling, and, green, exercises, have, proven, positive, effects, on, self, esteem, and, total, mood, disturbance, mountain, biking, is, proven, to, improve, mental, health, and, well, being, relating, to, coping, abilities, and, reducing, stress, there, are, strong, links, between, outdoor, environments, and, their, therapeutic, potential, risk, of, injury, is, present, when, mountain, biking, especially, in, the, more, extreme, disciplines, like, downhill, biking, free, ride, and, dirt, jumping, injuries, range, from, minor, wounds, such, as, cuts, and, abrasions, from, falls, on, gravel, or, other, surfaces, to, major, injuries, such, as, broken, bones, head, or, spinal, injuries, resulting, from, impacts, with, rocks, trees, or, the, terrain, being, ridden, on, another, risk, factor, is, that, mountain, biking, often, takes, place, in, wilderness, or, remote, areas, so, emergency, response, can, be, delayed, in, the, event, of, sustained, injury, protective, equipment, can, protect, against, minor, injuries, and, reduce, the, extent, or, seriousness, of, major, impacts, but, may, not, protect, a, rider, from, major, impacts, or, accidents, to, reduce, the, risk, of, injury, a, rider, will, also, take, steps, to, minimize, the, risk, of, accidents, and, thus, the, potential, for, injury, by, choosing, trails, which, fall, within, the, range, of, their, experience, level, ensuring, that, they, are, fit, enough, to, deal, with, the, trail, they, have, chosen, and, keeping, their, bike, in, top, mechanical, condition, lastly, maintenance, of, the, rider, s, bike, is, carried, out, more, frequently, for, mountain, biking, than, for, utility, cycling, or, casual, commuter, biking, mountain, biking, places, higher, demands, on, every, part, of, the, bike, jumps, and, impacts, can, crack, the, frame, or, damage, components, or, the, tire, rims, and, steep, fast, descents, can, quickly, wear, out, brake, pads, since, the, widespread, adoption, of, hydraulic, and, mechanical, disk, brakes, on, most, mountain, bikes, from, the, late, 1990s, the, issues, of, brake, pad, wear, misalignment, with, or, slippage, of, rim, brake, pads, on, rims, designed, for, rim, brakes, or, v, brakes, has, become, a, non, issue, thus, whereas, a, casual, rider, may, only, check, over, and, maintain, their, bike, every, few, months, a, mountain, biker, will, check, and, properly, maintain, the, bike, before, and, after, every, ride, mountain, bikers, have, faced, land, access, issues, from, the, beginnings, of, the, sport, some, areas, where, the, first, mountain, bikers, have, ridden, have, faced, extreme, restrictions, or, elimination, of, riding, this, opposition, has, led, to, the, development, of, local, regional, and, international, mountain, bike, groups, the, different, groups, that, formed, generally, work, to, create, new, trails, maintain, existing, trails, and, help, existing, trails, that, may, have, issues, groups, work, with, private, and, public, entities, from, the, individual, landowner, to, city, parks, departments, on, up, through, the, state, level, at, the, dnr, and, into, the, federal, level, different, groups, will, work, individually, or, together, to, achieve, results, advocacy, organizations, work, through, numerous, methods, such, as, education, trail, workdays, and, trail, patrols, examples, of, the, education, an, advocacy, group, can, provide, include, educate, local, bicycle, riders, property, managers, and, other, user, groups, on, the, proper, development, of, trails, and, on, the, international, mountain, bicycling, association, s, imba, rules, of, the, trail, examples, of, trail, work, days, can, include, flagging, cutting, and, signing, a, new, trail, or, removing, downed, trees, after, a, storm, a, trail, patrol, is, a, bike, rider, who, has, had, some, training, to, help, assist, others, including, non, cyclists, trail, users, the, imba, is, a, non, profit, advocacy, group, whose, mission, is, to, create, enhance, and, preserve, trail, opportunities, for, mountain, bikers, worldwide, imba, serves, as, an, umbrella, organization, for, mountain, biking, advocacy, worldwide, and, represents, more, than, 700, affiliated, mountain, biking, groups, the, group, was, originally, formed, to, fight, widespread, trail, closures, in, 1988, five, california, mountain, bike, clubs, linked, to, form, imba, the, founding, clubs, were, concerned, off, road, bicyclists, association, bicycle, trails, council, east, bay, bicycle, trails, council, marin, sacramento, rough, riders, and, responsible, organized, mountain, according, to, a, review, published, by, the, international, mountain, bicycling, association, the, environmental, impact, of, mountain, biking, as, a, relatively, new, sport, is, poorly, understood, the, review, notes, that, as, with, all, recreational, pursuits, it, is, clear, that, mountain, biking, contributes, some, degree, of, environmental, degradation, mountain, biking, can, result, in, both, soil, and, vegetation, damage, which, can, be, caused, by, skidding, but, also, by, the, construction, of, unauthorised, features, such, as, jumps, and, bridges, and, trails, themselves, several, studies, have, reported, that, a, mountain, bike, s, impact, on, a, given, length, of, trail, surface, is, comparable, to, that, of, a, hiker, and, substantially, less, than, that, of, an, equestrian, or, motorized, off, road, vehicle, a, critical, literature, review, by, jason, lathrop, on, the, ecological, impact, of, mountain, biking, notes, that, while, recreational, trail, use, in, general, is, well, studied, few, studies, explore, the, specific, impact, of, mountain, biking, he, quotes, the, bureau, of, land, management, an, estimated, 13, 5, million, mountain, bicyclists, visit, public, lands, each, year, to, enjoy, the, variety, of, trails, what, was, once, a, low, use, activity, that, was, easy, to, manage, has, become, more, complex, the, environmental, impacts, of, mountain, biking, can, be, greatly, reduced, by, not, riding, on, wet, or, sensitive, trails, keeping, speeds, modest, so, as, to, minimize, cornering, forces, and, braking, forces, not, skidding, and, by, staying, on, the, trail, mountain, biking, has, been, demonstrated, to, act, as, a, human, mediated, form, of, seed, dispersal, due, to, advancements, in, technology, mountain, bikers, have, begun, to, move, onto, trail, networks, once, only, accessible, by, hikers, the, nature, of, their, movement, patterns, also, plays, an, important, role, as, a, vector, for, seed, dispersal, mountain, bikes, are, not, bound, to, any, specific, type, of, infrastructure, and, can, therefore, move, freely, between, ecological, environments, acting, as, a, connecting, dispersal, vector, between, habitats, combined, with, their, relatively, long, range, and, speeds, they, also, contribute, to, long, range, dispersal, in, an, effort, to, understand, and, assess, the, socio, ecological, consequences, of, mountain, bikes, as, a, vector, for, seed, dispersal, fabio, weiss, tyler, j, brummer, and, gesine, pufal, conducted, an, environmental, impact, study, on, forest, trails, in, freiburg, germany, the, results, of, the, study, found, that, although, the, majority, of, seeds, detached, from, tires, within, the, first, 5, 20, meters, small, portions, of, seeds, were, still, present, after, 200, 500, meters, contributing, to, moderate, dispersal, the, potential, for, long, distance, dispersal, was, found, through, the, transport, of, seeds, on, areas, of, the, bike, that, did, not, come, into, frequent, contact, with, the, ground, the, study, also, found, that, the, majority, of, participants, only, cleaned, their, bikes, on, average, every, 70, km, or, every, two, rides, rides, executed, in, two, different, areas, have, the, potential, to, connect, previously, unconnected, habitats, creating, the, potential, for, unwanted, plant, invasions, to, mitigate, the, accidental, dispersal, of, an, unwanted, invasive, species, the, authors, of, the, study, proposed, the, following, measures, to, support, conservation, a, clean, the, bike, between, rides, in, different, habitats, before, traveling, and, especially, before, entering, sensitive, natural, areas, and, regions, b, control, weeds, and, non, native, species, at, trailheads, and, trail, margins, c, educate, mountain, bike, riders, about, the, potential, dispersal, of, different, species, good, stewardship, begets, riding, privileges, d, encourage, cooperation, between, mountain, bikers, and, managing, authorities, avoid, condescending, regulations,
