another, enjoying, time, spent, together, and, being, able, to, engage, in, a, positive, and, supportive, role, to, one, another, sometimes, friends, are, distinguished, from, family, as, in, the, saying, friends, and, family, and, sometimes, from, lovers, e, g, lovers, and, friends, although, the, line, is, blurred, with, friends, with, benefits, similarly, being, in, the, friend, zone, describes, someone, who, is, restricted, from, rising, from, the, status, of, friend, to, that, of, lover, see, also, unrequited, love, friendship, has, been, studied, in, academic, fields, such, as, communication, sociology, social, psychology, anthropology, and, philosophy, various, academic, theories, of, friendship, have, been, proposed, including, social, exchange, theory, equity, theory, relational, dialectics, and, attachment, styles, annotations, the, understanding, of, friendship, by, children, tends, to, be, focused, on, areas, such, as, common, activities, physical, proximity, and, shared, expectations, 498, such, friendships, provide, opportunity, for, playing, and, practicing, self, regulation, 246, most, children, tend, to, describe, friendship, in, terms, of, things, like, sharing, and, children, are, more, likely, to, share, with, someone, they, consider, to, be, a, friend, 246, recent, work, on, friendship, in, young, children, investigated, the, cues, they, use, to, infer, friendship, young, children, use, cues, such, as, sharing, resources, like, snacks, and, sharing, secrets, especially, in, older, adolescents, to, determine, friendship, status, when, comparing, cues, of, similarity, in, food, preference, or, gender, propinquity, and, loyalty, in, adolescent, children, younger, children, rely, on, similarity, in, gender, food, preferences, but, more, so, propinquity, to, infer, friendship, while, older, adolescents, rely, heavily, on, propinquity, to, infer, friendship, as, children, mature, they, become, more, reliant, on, others, as, awareness, grows, they, gain, the, ability, to, empathize, with, their, friends, and, enjoy, playing, in, groups, they, also, experience, peer, rejection, as, they, move, through, the, middle, childhood, years, establishing, good, friendships, at, a, young, age, helps, a, child, to, be, better, acclimated, in, society, later, on, in, their, life, based, upon, the, reports, of, teachers, and, mothers, 75, of, preschool, children, had, at, least, one, friend, this, figure, rose, to, 78, through, the, fifth, grade, as, measured, by, co, nomination, as, friends, and, 55, had, a, mutual, best, friend, 247, about, 15, of, children, were, found, to, be, chronically, friendless, reporting, periods, of, at, least, six, months, without, mutual, friends, 250, friendships, in, childhood, can, assist, in, the, development, of, certain, skills, such, as, building, empathy, and, learning, different, problem, solving, techniques, coaching, from, parents, can, help, children, make, friends, eileen, kennedy, moore, describes, three, key, ingredients, of, children, s, friendship, formation, 1, openness, 2, similarity, and, 3, shared, fun, parents, can, also, help, children, understand, social, guidelines, they, have, not, learned, on, their, own, drawing, from, research, by, robert, selman, and, others, kennedy, moore, outlines, developmental, stages, in, children, s, friendship, reflecting, an, increasing, capacity, to, understand, others, perspectives, i, want, it, my, way, what, s, in, it, for, me, by, the, rules, caring, and, sharing, and, friends, through, thick, and, thin, in, adolescence, friendships, become, more, giving, sharing, frank, supportive, and, spontaneous, adolescents, tend, to, seek, out, peers, who, can, provide, such, qualities, in, a, reciprocal, relationship, and, to, avoid, peers, whose, problematic, behavior, suggests, they, may, not, be, able, to, satisfy, these, needs, particular, personal, characteristics, and, dispositions, are, also, features, sought, by, adolescents, when, choosing, whom, to, begin, a, friendship, with, during, adolescence, friendship, relationships, are, more, based, on, similar, morals, and, values, loyalty, and, shared, interests, than, those, of, children, whose, friendships, stem, from, being, in, the, same, vicinity, and, access, to, playthings, 246, a, large, study, of, american, adolescents, determined, how, their, engagement, in, problematic, behavior, such, as, stealing, fighting, and, truancy, was, related, to, their, friendships, findings, indicated, that, adolescents, who, were, less, likely, to, engage, in, problematic, behavior, had, friends, who, did, well, in, school, participated, in, school, activities, avoided, drinking, and, had, good, mental, health, the, opposite, was, true, of, adolescents, who, did, engage, in, problematic, behavior, whether, adolescents, were, influenced, by, their, friends, to, engage, in, problem, behavior, depended, on, how, much, they, were, exposed, to, those, friends, and, whether, they, and, their, friendship, groups, fit, in, at, school, friendships, formed, during, post, secondary, education, last, longer, than, friendships, formed, earlier, in, late, adolescence, cross, racial, friendships, tend, to, be, uncommon, likely, due, to, prejudice, and, cultural, differences, friendship, in, adulthood, provides, companionship, affection, and, emotional, support, and, contributes, positively, to, mental, well, being, and, improved, physical, health, 426, adults, may, find, it, particularly, difficult, to, maintain, meaningful, friendships, in, the, workplace, the, workplace, can, crackle, with, competition, so, people, learn, to, hide, vulnerabilities, and, quirks, from, colleagues, work, friendships, often, take, on, a, transactional, feel, it, is, difficult, to, say, where, networking, ends, and, real, friendship, begins, many, adults, value, the, financial, well, being, and, security, that, their, job, provides, more, than, developing, friendships, with, coworkers, 2, 000, american, adults, surveyed, had, an, average, of, two, close, friends, defined, as, people, they, had, discussed, important, matters, with, in, the, past, six, months, numerous, studies, with, adults, suggest, that, friendships, and, other, supportive, relationships, enhance, self, esteem, older, adults, report, high, levels, of, personal, satisfaction, in, their, friendships, as, they, age, even, as, the, overall, number, of, friends, tends, to, decline, this, satisfaction, is, associated, with, an, increased, ability, to, accomplish, activities, of, daily, living, as, well, as, a, reduced, decline, in, cognitive, abilities, decreased, instances, of, hospitalization, and, better, outcomes, related, to, rehabilitation, 427, the, overall, number, of, reported, friends, in, later, life, may, be, mediated, by, increased, lucidity, better, speech, and, vision, and, marital, status, 53, a, decline, in, the, number, of, friends, an, individual, has, as, they, become, older, has, been, explained, by, carstensen, s, socioemotional, selectivity, theory, which, describes, a, change, in, motivation, that, adults, experience, when, socializing, the, theory, states, that, an, increase, in, age, is, characterized, by, a, shift, from, information, gathering, to, emotional, regulation, in, order, to, maintain, positive, emotions, older, adults, restrict, their, social, groups, to, those, with, whom, they, share, an, emotional, bond, as, one, review, phrased, it, research, within, the, past, four, decades, has, now, consistently, found, that, older, adults, reporting, the, highest, levels, of, happiness, and, general, well, being, also, report, strong, close, ties, to, numerous, friends, as, family, responsibilities, and, vocational, pressures, lessen, friendships, become, more, important, among, the, elderly, friendships, can, provide, links, to, the, larger, community, serve, as, a, protective, factor, against, depression, and, loneliness, and, compensate, for, potential, losses, in, social, support, previously, given, by, family, members, 32, 33, especially, for, people, who, cannot, go, out, as, often, interactions, with, friends, allow, for, continued, societal, interaction, additionally, older, adults, in, declining, health, who, remain, in, contact, with, friends, show, improved, psychological, well, being, forming, and, maintaining, friendships, often, requires, time, and, effort, friendships, are, foremost, formed, by, choice, typically, on, the, basis, that, the, parties, involved, admire, each, other, on, an, intimate, level, and, enjoy, commonality, and, socializing, given, that, friendships, provide, people, with, many, mental, social, and, health, benefits, people, should, want, to, associate, with, and, form, lasting, relationships, with, people, who, can, provide, the, benefits, they, need, thus, people, have, specific, friendship, preferences, for, the, types, of, behaviors, and, traits, that, are, associated, with, these, benefits, recent, work, on, friendship, preferences, shows, that, while, there, is, much, overlap, between, men, and, women, for, the, traits, they, prefer, in, close, same, gender, friends, e, g, being, prioritized, over, other, friends, friends, with, varied, knowledge, skills, there, are, some, differences, women, compared, to, men, had, greater, preference, for, emotional, support, emotional, disclosure, and, emotional, reassurance, while, men, compared, to, women, had, greater, preference, for, friends, that, offer, opportunities, for, accruing, status, boosting, their, reputation, and, will, provide, physical, aid, most, people, underestimate, how, much, other, people, like, them, the, liking, gap, can, make, it, difficult, to, form, friendships, according, to, communications, professor, jeffery, hall, most, friendships, involve, tacitly, agreed, upon, expectations, in, six, different, areas, not, all, relationships, have, the, same, balance, of, each, area, for, example, women, may, prefer, friendships, that, emphasize, genuine, positive, regard, and, deeper, self, disclosure, and, men, may, prefer, friendships, with, a, little, more, agency, people, with, certain, types, of, developmental, disorders, may, struggle, to, make, and, maintain, friendships, this, is, especially, true, of, children, with, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, autism, spectrum, disorders, or, children, with, down, syndrome, studies, found, that, strong, social, supports, improve, a, person, s, prospects, for, good, health, and, longevity, conversely, loneliness, and, a, lack, of, social, supports, are, linked, to, an, increased, risk, of, heart, disease, viral, infections, and, cancer, as, well, as, higher, mortality, rates, overall, researchers, termed, friendship, networks, a, behavioral, vaccine, that, boosts, both, physical, and, mental, health, a, large, body, of, research, links, friendship, and, health, but, the, precise, reasons, for, the, connection, remain, unclear, most, studies, in, this, area, are, large, prospective, studies, that, follow, people, over, time, and, while, there, may, be, a, correlation, between, the, two, variables, friendship, and, health, status, researchers, still, do, not, know, if, there, is, a, cause, and, effect, relationship, such, as, good, friendships, improve, health, theories, that, attempt, to, explain, this, link, include, that, good, friends, encourage, their, friends, to, lead, more, healthy, lifestyles, that, good, friends, encourage, their, friends, to, seek, help, and, access, services, when, needed, that, good, friends, enhance, their, friends, coping, skills, in, dealing, with, illness, and, other, health, problems, and, that, good, friends, actually, affect, physiological, pathways, that, are, protective, of, health, having, few, or, no, friends, is, a, common, experience, among, those, who, are, diagnosed, with, a, range, of, mental, disorders, and, can, be, used, as, a, telling, factor, a, 2004, study, from, the, american, journal, of, public, health, observed, that, lack, of, friendship, plays, a, role, in, increasing, risk, of, suicidal, ideation, among, female, adolescents, while, also, true, for, having, more, friends, who, are, not, themselves, friends, with, one, another, however, it, is, also, suggested, that, no, similar, effect, is, observed, for, males, higher, friendship, quality, directly, contributes, to, self, esteem, self, confidence, and, social, development, a, world, happiness, database, study, found, that, people, with, close, friendships, are, happier, although, the, absolute, number, of, friends, did, not, increase, happiness, other, studies, suggested, that, children, who, have, friendships, of, a, high, quality, may, be, protected, against, the, development, of, certain, disorders, such, as, anxiety, and, depression, conversely, having, few, friends, is, associated, with, dropping, out, of, school, as, well, as, aggression, adult, crime, and, loneliness, 500, peer, rejection, is, also, associated, with, lower, later, aspiration, in, the, workforce, and, participation, in, social, activities, while, higher, levels, of, friendship, were, associated, with, higher, adult, self, esteem, 500, 01, having, more, close, friends, is, correlated, with, improved, mental, health, and, cognitive, ability, however, this, association, stops, once, around, five, friends, is, reached, after, which, having, more, friends, is, no, longer, linked, to, better, mental, health, and, is, correlated, with, lower, cognition, additionally, people, with, few, or, many, friends, had, more, symptoms, of, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, and, were, less, able, to, learn, from, their, experiences, friendships, may, end, this, is, often, the, result, of, natural, changes, over, time, as, friends, grow, more, distant, both, physically, and, emotionally, but, it, can, also, be, the, result, of, a, sudden, shock, such, as, learning, that, a, friend, holds, incompatible, values, some, social, media, influencers, provide, suggestions, using, therapy, speak, to, break, up, with, a, friend, these, have, been, criticized, for, being, impersonal, and, upsetting, partially, because, they, often, reduce, a, conversation, to, a, 30, second, soundbite, sized, announcement, social, media, posts, may, also, encourage, confrontations, akin, to, a, workplace, performance, appraisal, in, which, one, person, tells, a, friend, that, they, are, dissatisfied, and, threatens, to, break, off, the, relationship, if, the, friend, does, not, conform, to, their, expectations, the, end, of, a, friendship, is, often, due, to, inappropriate, expectations, on, the, part, of, the, dissatisfied, person, and, demanding, that, a, friend, meet, those, expectations, is, incompatible, with, friendship, s, voluntary, qualities, another, option, would, be, for, the, dissatisfied, person, to, look, for, another, friend, who, can, meet, the, unmet, need, for, example, if, someone, is, dissatisfied, because, a, friend, does, not, plan, events, then, that, person, could, find, a, second, friend, someone, who, enjoys, planning, events, instead, of, rejecting, the, first, friend, for, not, being, able, to, single, handedly, meet, all, of, their, needs, the, dissolution, of, a, friendship, may, be, taken, personally, as, a, rejection, disruptions, of, friendships, are, associated, with, increased, guilt, anger, and, depression, and, may, be, highly, stressful, events, especially, in, childhood, however, potential, negative, effects, can, be, mitigated, if, the, dissolution, of, a, friendship, is, replaced, with, another, close, relationship, 248, friends, tend, to, be, similar, to, one, another, in, terms, of, age, gender, behavior, substance, abuse, personal, disposition, and, academic, performance, 248, 426, 55, 56, in, ethnically, diverse, countries, children, and, adolescents, tend, to, form, friendships, with, others, of, the, same, race, or, ethnicity, beginning, in, preschool, and, peaking, in, middle, or, late, childhood, 264, as, a, result, of, social, separation, and, confinement, of, the, sexes, friendships, between, men, and, women, have, little, presence, in, recorded, history, having, only, become, a, widely, accepted, practice, in, the, 20th, century, in, general, girl, girl, friendship, interactions, among, children, tend, to, focus, on, interpersonal, connections, and, mutual, support, in, contrast, boy, boy, interaction, tends, to, be, more, focused, on, social, status, and, may, discourage, the, expression, of, emotional, needs, girls, report, more, anxiety, jealousy, and, relational, victimization, and, less, stability, related, to, their, friendships, boys, on, the, other, hand, report, higher, levels, of, physical, victimization, nevertheless, boys, and, girls, tend, to, report, relative, satisfaction, levels, with, their, friendships, 249, 50, women, tend, to, be, more, expressive, and, intimate, in, their, same, sex, friendships, and, have, fewer, friends, men, are, more, likely, to, define, intimacy, in, terms, of, shared, physical, experiences, in, contrast, women, are, more, likely, to, define, it, in, terms, of, shared, emotional, ones, men, are, less, likely, to, make, emotional, or, personal, disclosures, to, other, men, because, the, other, man, could, use, this, information, against, them, however, they, will, disclose, this, information, to, women, as, they, are, not, in, competition, with, them, and, men, tend, to, regard, friendships, with, women, as, more, meaningful, intimate, and, pleasant, male, male, friendships, are, generally, more, like, alliances, while, female, female, friendships, are, much, more, attachment, based, this, also, means, that, the, end, of, male, male, friendships, tends, to, be, less, emotionally, upsetting, than, that, of, female, female, friendships, women, tend, to, be, more, socially, adept, than, their, male, peers, among, older, adults, as, a, result, many, older, men, may, rely, upon, a, female, companion, such, as, a, spouse, to, compensate, for, their, comparative, lack, of, social, skills, 55, one, study, found, that, women, in, europe, and, north, america, were, slightly, more, likely, than, men, to, self, report, having, a, best, friend, which, relationships, count, as, a, true, friend, rather, than, as, an, acquaintance, or, a, co, worker, vary, by, culture, in, english, speaking, cultures, it, is, not, unusual, for, people, to, include, weaker, relationships, as, being, friends, in, other, cultures, such, as, the, russian, and, polish, cultures, only, the, most, significant, relationships, are, considered, friends, a, russian, might, have, one, or, two, friends, plus, a, large, number, of, pals, or, acquaintances, a, canadian, in, similar, circumstances, might, count, all, of, these, relationships, as, being, friends, in, western, cultures, friendships, are, often, seen, as, lesser, to, familial, or, romantic, relationships, friendships, in, ancient, greece, were, more, utilitarian, than, affectionate, being, based, upon, obligation, and, reliance, though, different, classical, communities, understood, friendship, in, different, ways, and, the, greeks, held, a, much, broader, conception, of, friendship, than, modern, english, speaking, cultures, do, aristotle, wrote, of, there, being, three, kinds, of, friendships, those, in, recognition, of, pleasure, those, in, recognition, of, advantage, and, those, in, recognition, of, virtue, when, discussing, taboos, of, friendship, it, was, found, that, chinese, respondents, found, more, than, their, british, counterparts, evolutionary, approaches, to, understanding, friendship, focus, primarily, on, its, function, in, other, words, what, does, friendship, do, for, individuals, how, does, it, work, psychologically, and, how, do, these, processes, affect, people, s, actual, behavior, within, this, field, there, are, multiple, proposed, theories, or, perspectives, about, the, function, of, forming, friendships, and, making, friends, one, is, the, theory, of, reciprocal, altruism, which, provides, an, explanation, as, to, why, individuals, make, friends, with, un, related, others, it, argues, that, friendship, allows, people, to, exchange, benefits, with, each, other, and, keep, track, of, these, exchanges, in, order, to, avoid, exchanging, benefits, with, a, poor, cooperator, or, someone, who, will, take, benefits, without, giving, any, in, return, another, perspective, likens, friendships, to, insurance, investments, and, argues, when, deciding, to, invest, into, forming, a, new, friendship, with, another, person, an, individual, should, be, able, to, discern, whether, the, potential, friend, will, be, willing, to, help, them, back, in, the, future, if, the, potential, friend, is, in, the, position, to, help, them, in, the, future, and, if, the, friendship, is, worth, continuing, or, not, especially, when, many, other, potential, friendships, can, be, made, these, factors, will, determine, whether, forming, a, friendship, with, someone, will, be, beneficial, or, injurious, another, explanation, for, the, function, of, friendships, is, called, the, alliance, hypothesis, which, argues, that, the, function, of, friendships, is, to, acquire, alliances, for, future, conflicts, or, disputes, the, alliance, hypothesis, states, that, conflicts, typically, can, be, won, if, and, only, if, one, side, is, able, to, acquire, more, allies, than, the, competing, side, all, else, equal, so, individuals, should, be, able, to, increase, their, odds, of, winning, the, conflict, if, they, are, able, to, recruit, more, alliances, to, their, side, choosing, your, allies, can, be, very, important, and, there, exists, a, variety, of, methods, in, deciding, allies, such, as, bandwagoning, or, choosing, an, ally, that, is, loyal, and, will, come, to, your, aid, in, the, future, conflicts, thus, individuals, should, form, alliances, i, e, friendships, with, people, that, ranks, themselves, higher, than, other, allies, friends, it, is, relative, rank, i, e, where, the, self, ranks, among, all, other, individuals, that, is, the, most, important, contributing, factor, when, deciding, who, is, a, loyal, ally, and, friend, jealousy, is, an, emotion, that, is, often, studied, in, the, context, of, romantic, and, sexual, relationships, however, individuals, also, feel, jealous, when, it, comes, to, potentially, losing, valued, friendships, friendship, jealousy, acts, as, an, alert, to, the, self, that, a, close, friends, other, friends, may, be, a, threat, to, the, self, s, relationship, with, that, close, friend, which, motivates, the, self, to, enact, behaviors, that, prevent, the, close, friend, from, further, developing, better, relationships, with, their, other, friends, a, recent, multi, study, paper, found, that, friendship, jealousy, is, activated, by, the, potential, loss, of, a, friend, by, another, person, is, highly, attuned, to, the, feeling, or, thoughts, of, being, replaced, and, that, the, closer, or, more, valued, that, friendship, is, the, more, friendship, jealousy, someone, will, feel, men, and, women, also, tend, to, express, different, levels, of, friendship, jealousy, depending, on, the, person, who, is, attempting, to, replace, them, in, the, friendship, such, that, women, compared, to, men, expressed, more, jealousy, over, the, potential, loss, of, a, best, friend, to, another, woman, friendship, is, found, among, animals, of, higher, intelligence, such, as, higher, mammals, and, some, birds, there, is, ample, comparative, animal, research, on, the, existence, of, friendships, or, the, existence, of, similar, forms, of, relationships, in, animals, the, function, of, these, relationships, in, non, human, animals, appears, to, primarily, be, for, forming, and, solidifying, alliances, for, a, wide, range, of, fitness, and, survival, reasons, across, a, range, of, non, human, animal, species, alliances, are, formed, for, protection, competition, over, reproductive, access, to, receptive, mates, as, means, to, seek, social, comfort, solidify, social, bonds, and, to, thwart, diseases, an, expansive, meta, analysis, examining, grooming, behaviors, in, 14, different, primate, species, found, that, grooming, behaviors, elicit, different, types, of, benefit, exchanges, such, as, support, and, aid, for, future, intra, species, conflicts, male, bottlenose, dolphins, use, synchronous, surfacing, to, determine, membership, of, other, potential, male, allies, while, female, bottlenose, dolphins, use, gentle, contact, behaviors, i, e, touching, behaviors, with, other, females, in, response, to, harassment, from, males, female, spotted, hyenas, whose, groups, follow, a, very, strict, dominance, hierarchy, form, alliances, i, e, coalitionary, bonds, to, move, up, the, dominance, hierarchy, by, usurping, a, hyena, of, higher, dominance, rank, feral, female, horses, develop, alliances, with, other, female, horses, to, avoid, harassment, from, male, horses, and, these, alliances, aid, in, increasing, their, offspring, s, chances, of, survival
