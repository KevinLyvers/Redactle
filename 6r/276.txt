effects, on, punning, in, either, the, question, or, the, answer, archer, taylor, says, that, we, can, probably, say, that, riddling, is, a, universal, art, and, cites, riddles, from, hundreds, of, different, cultures, including, finnish, hungarian, american, indian, chinese, russian, dutch, and, filipino, sources, amongst, many, others, 3, many, riddles, and, riddle, themes, are, internationally, widespread, in, the, assessment, of, elli, k, ng, s, maranda, originally, writing, about, malaitian, riddles, but, with, an, insight, that, has, been, taken, up, more, widely, whereas, myths, serve, to, encode, and, establish, social, norms, riddles, make, a, point, of, playing, with, conceptual, boundaries, and, crossing, them, for, the, intellectual, pleasure, of, showing, that, things, are, not, quite, as, stable, as, they, seem, though, the, point, of, doing, so, may, still, ultimately, be, to, play, with, boundaries, but, ultimately, to, affirm, them, the, modern, english, word, riddle, shares, its, origin, with, the, word, read, both, stemming, from, the, common, germanic, verb, r, dan, which, meant, to, interpret, guess, from, this, verb, came, the,

riddle, in, modern, western, scholarship, was, by, robert, petsch, in, 1899, with, another, seminal, contribution, inspired, by, structuralism, by, robert, a, georges, and, alan, dundes, in, 1963, georges, and, dundes, suggested, that, a, riddle, is, a, traditional, verbal, expression, which, contains, one, or, more, descriptive, elements, a, pair, of, which, may, be, in, opposition, the, referent, of, the, elements, is, to, be, guessed, there, are, many, possible, sub, sets, of, the, riddle, including, charades, droodles, and, some, jokes, in, some, traditions, and, contexts, riddles, may, overlap, with, proverbs, for, example, the, russian, phrase, nothing, hurts, it, but, it, groans, all, the, time, can, be, deployed, as, a, proverb, when, its, referent, is, a, hypochondriac, or, as, a, riddle, when, its, referent, is, a, pig, much, academic, research, on, riddles, has, focused, on, collecting, cataloguing, defining, and, typologising, riddles, key, work, on, cataloguing, and,

also, goes, into, proposing, and, debating, solutions, whereas, previously, researchers, had, tended, to, take, riddles, out, of, their, social, performance, contexts, the, rise, of, anthropology, in, the, post, war, period, encouraged, more, researchers, to, study, the, social, role, of, riddles, and, riddling, highlighting, their, role, of, re, orienting, reality, in, the, face, of, fear, and, anxiety, however, wide, ranging, studies, of, riddles, have, tended, to, be, limited, to, western, countries, with, asian, and, african, riddles, being, relatively, neglected, riddles, have, also, attracted, linguists, often, studying, riddles, from, the, point, of, view, of, semiotics, meanwhile, the, twenty, first, century, has, seen, the, rise, of, extensive, work, on, medieval, european, riddles, from, the, point, of, view, of, eco, criticism, exploring, how, riddles, can, inform, us, about, people, s, conceptualisation, and, exploration, of, their, environment, many, riddles, appear,

are, treated, in, early, studies, of, sanskrit, poetry, such, as, da, in, s, seventh, or, eighth, century, k, vy, dar, a, early, narrative, literature, also, sometimes, includes, riddles, prominently, the, mahabharata, which, for, example, contains, the, yaksha, prashna, a, series, of, riddles, posed, by, a, nature, spirit, yaksha, to, yudhishthira, the, first, riddle, collection, in, a, medieval, indic, language, is, traditionally, thought, to, be, the, riddles, of, amir, khusrow, 1253, 1325, which, are, written, in, hindawi, in, verse, in, the, m, trika, metre, as, of, the, 1970s, folklorists, had, not, undertaken, extensive, collecting, of, riddles, in, india, but, riddling, was, known, to, be, thriving, as, a, form, of, folk, literature, sometimes, in, verse, riddles, have, also, been, collected, in, tamil, while, riddles, are, not, numerous, in, the, bible, they, are, present, most, famously, in, samson, s, riddle, in, judges, xiv, 14, but, also, in, i, kings, 10, 1, 13, where, the, queen, of, sheba, tests, solomon, s, wisdom, and, in, the, talmud, sirach, also, mentions, riddles, as, a, popular, dinner, pastime, while, the, aramaic, story, of, ahikar, contains, a, long, section, of, proverbial, wisdom, that, in, some, versions, also, contains, riddles, otherwise, riddles, are, sparse, in, ancient, semitic, writing, in, the, medieval, period, however, verse, riddles, alongside, other, puzzles, and, conundra, became, a, significant, literary, form, in, the, arabic, speaking, world, and, accordingly, in, islamic, persian, culture, and, in, hebrew, particularly, in, al, andalus, since, early, arabic, and, persian, poetry, often, features, rich, metaphorical, description, and, ekphrasis, there, is, a, natural, overlap, in, style, and, approach, between, poetry, generally, and, riddles, specifically, literary, riddles, are, therefore, often, a, subset, of, the, descriptive, poetic, form, known, in, both, traditions, as, wasf, riddles, are, attested, in, anthologies, of, poetry, and, in, prosimetrical, portrayals, of, riddle, contests, in, arabic, maq, m, t, and, in, persian, epics, such, as, the, shahnameh, meanwhile, in, hebrew, dunash, ben, labrat, 920, 990, credited, with, transposing, arabic, metres, into, hebrew, composed, a, number, of, riddles, mostly, apparently, inspired, by, folk, riddles, other, hebrew, writing, exponents, included, moses, ibn, ezra, yehuda, alharizi, judah, halevi, immanuel, the, roman, and, israel, onceneyra, in, both, arabic, and, persian, riddles, seem, to, have, become, increasingly, scholarly, in, style, over, time, increasingly, emphasising, riddles, and, puzzles, in, which, the, interpreter, has, to, resolve, clues, to, letters, and, numbers, to, put, together, the, word, which, is, the, riddle, s, solution, riddles, have, been, collected, by, modern, scholars, throughout, the, arabic, speaking, world, riddles, are, known, to, have, been, popular, in, greece, in, hellenistic, times, and, possibly, before, they, were, prominent, among, the, entertainments, and, challenges, presented, at, symposia, oracles, were, also, represented, as, speaking, in, often, riddlic, language, however, the, first, significant, corpus, of, greek, riddles, survives, in, an, anthology, of, earlier, material, known, as, the, greek, anthology, which, contains, about, 50, verse, riddles, probably, put, into, its, present, form, by, constantine, cephalas, working, in, the, tenth, century, ce, most, surviving, ancient, greek, riddles, are, in, verse, in, the, second, chapter, of, book, iii, of, aristotle, s, rhetoric, the, philosopher, stated, that, good, riddles, do, in, general, provide, us, with, satisfactory, metaphors, for, metaphors, imply, riddles, and, therefore, a, good, riddle, can, furnish, a, good, metaphor, literary, riddles, were, also, composed, in, byzantium, from, perhaps, the, tenth, century, with, the, work, of, john, geometres, into, the, fifteenth, century, along, with, a, neo, byzantine, revival, in, around, the, early, eighteenth, century, there, was, a, particular, peak, around, the, long, twelfth, century, two, latin,

century, by, an, unknown, author, perhaps, in, northern, italy, symphosius, s, collection, also, inspired, a, number, of, anglo, saxon, riddlers, who, wrote, in, latin, they, remained, influential, in, medieval, castilian, tradition, being, the, basis, for, the, second, set, of, riddles, in, the, thirteenth, century, libro, de, apolonio, posed, by, apolonio, s, daughter, tarsiana, to, her, father, the, perhaps, eighth, or, ninth, century, veronese, riddle, is, a, key, witness, to, the, linguistic, transition, from, latin, to, romance, but, riddles, are, otherwise, rare, in, medieval, romance, languages, however, in, the, early, modern, period, printed, riddle, collections, were, published, in, french, including, the, adevineaux, amoureux, printed, in, bruges, by, colard, mansion, around, 1479, and, demandes, joyeuses, en, maniere, de, quolibets, the, basis, for, wynkyn, de, worde, s, 1511, demaundes, joyous, riddles, survive, only, fragmentarily, in, old, high, german, three, very, short, possible, examples, exist, in, manuscripts, from, the, monastery, of, st, gallen, but, while, certainly, cryptic, they, are, not, necessarily, riddles, in, a, strict, sense, about, 150, survive, in, middle, high, german, mostly, quoted, in, other, literary, contexts, likewise, riddles, are, rare, in, old, norse, almost, all, occur, in, one, section, of, hervarar, saga, ok, hei, reks, in, which, the, god, inn, propounds, around, 37, riddles, depending, on, the, manuscript, these, riddles, do, however, provide, insights, into, norse, mythology, medieval, scandinavian, social, norms, and, rarely, attested, poetic, forms, by, contrast, verse, riddles, were, prominent, in, early, medieval, england, following, the, seminal, composition, of, one, hundred, and, one, riddles, by, aldhelm, c, 639, 709, written, in, latin, and, inspired, by, the, fourth, or, fifth, century, latin, poet, symphosius, aldhelm, was, followed, by, a, number, of, other, anglo, saxons, writing, riddles, in, latin, this, prestigious, literary, heritage, contextualises, the, survival, of, nearly, one, hundred, riddles, in, the, tenth, century, exeter, book, one, of, the, main, surviving, collections, of, old, english, verse, the, riddles, in, this, book, vary, in, subject, matter, from, ribald, innuendo, to, theological, sophistication, three, exeter, book, riddle, 35, and, riddles, 40, 66, are, in, origin, translations, of, riddles, by, aldhelm, and, riddle, 35, the, only, old, english, riddle, to, be, attested, in, another, manuscript, besides, the, exeter, book, unlike, the, pithy, three, line, riddles, of, symphosius, the, old, english, riddles, tend, to, be, discursive, often, musing, on, complex, processes, of, manufacture, when, describing, artefacts, such, as, mead, exeter, book, riddle, 27, or, a, reed, pen, or, pipe, exeter, book, riddle, 60, they, are, noted, for, providing, perspectives, on, the, world, which, give, voice, to, actors, which, tend, not, to, appear, in, old, english, poetry, ranging, from, female, slaves, to, animals, and, plants, and, they, often, subvert, the, conventions, of, old, english, heroic, and, religious, poetry, while, medieval, records, of, germanic, language, riddles, are, patchy, with, the, advent, of, print, in, the, west, collections, of, riddles, and, similar, kinds, of, questions, began, to, be, published, a, large, number, of, riddle, collections, were, printed, in, the, german, speaking, world, and, partly, under, german, influence, in, scandinavia, riddles, were, evidently, hugely, popular, in, germany, a, recent, research, project, uncovered, more, than, 100, 000, early, modern, german, riddles, with, the, most, important, collection, being, that, strassburger, r, tselbuch, first, published, around, 1500, and, many, times, reprinted, this, is, one, of, the, most, famous, riddles, of, that, time, es, kam, ein, vogel, federlos, sa, auf, dem, baume, blattlos, da, kam, die, jungfer, mundlos, und, fra, den, vogel, federlos, von, dem, baume, blattlos, there, came, a, bird, featherless, sat, on, the, trees, leafless, there, came, a, maiden, speechless, and, ate, the, bird, featherless, from, off,

bird, likewise, early, modern, english, speakers, published, printed, riddle, collections, such, as, the, 1598, riddles, of, heraclitus, and, democritus, which, includes, for, example, the, following, riddle, first, i, was, small, and, round, like, a, pearl, then, long, and, slender, as, brave, as, an, earl, since, like, an, hermit, i, lived, in, a, cell, and, now, like, a, rogue, in, the, wide, world, i, dwell, after, the, early, middle, ages, the, riddle, was, seldom, used, as, a, literary, form, in, english, tellingly, while, jonathan, swift, composed, at, least, eight, verse, riddles, on, themes, such, as, a, pen, gold, and, the, privy, this, was, seen, as, a, lapse, in, taste, by, many, of, his, contemporaries, however, although, riddles, are, seldom, used, today, as, a, literary, form, in, their, own, right, they, have, arguably, influenced, the, approach, to, poetry, of, a, number, of, twentieth, century, poets, such, as, francis, ponge, wallace, stevens, richard, wilbur, rainer, m, rilke, and, henrikas, radauskas, the, famed, transcendentalist, ralph, waldo, emerson, once, wrote, all, is, a, riddle, and, the, key, to, a, riddle, is, another, riddle, riddles,

afraid, of, seven, because, seven, eight, nine, eight, can, be, replaced, with, ate, these, riddles, are, now, mostly, children, s, humour, and, games, rather, than, literary, compositions, some, riddles, are, composed, of, foreign, words, and, play, on, similar, sounds, as, in, this, plays, on, the, fact, that, the, french, words, for, four, and, five, are, pronounced, similarly, to, the, english, words, cat, and, sank, hence, the, pun, being, the, cat, sank, while, also, counting, to, five, in, french, few, riddles, are, attested, in, medieval, celtic, languages, though, this, depends, on, how, narrowly, a, riddle, is, defined, some, early, medieval, welsh, and, irish, juridical, texts, have, been, read, as, being, riddles, one, undisputed, riddle, is, attested, in, medieval, welsh, an, elaborate, text, entitled, canu, y, gwynt, song, of, the, wind, in, the, fourteenth, century, book, of, taliesin, probably, inspired, by, latin, riddles, on, the, same, theme,
