by, individuals, to, attract, select, and, retain, mates, mating, strategies, overlap, with, reproductive, strategies, which, encompass, a, broader, set, of, behaviors, involving, the, timing, of, reproduction, and, the, trade, off, between, quantity, and, quality, of, offspring, see, life, history, theory, relative, to, other, animals, human, mating, strategies, are, unique, in, their,

responses, during, sexual, stimulation, are, fairly, similar, for, both, men, and, women, and, there, are, four, phases, sexual, dysfunction, is, the, inability, to, react, emotionally, or,

and, orgasm, in, the, media, sexual, dysfunction, is, often, associated, with, men, but, in, actuality, it, is, more, commonly, observed, in, females, 43, percent, than, males, 31, percent, sexual, activity, can, lower, blood, pressure, and, overall, stress, levels, it, serves, to, release, tension, elevate, mood, and, possibly, create, a, profound, sense, of, relaxation, especially, in, the,

a, multitude, of, possible, reasons, although, the, primary, evolutionary, purpose, of, sexual, activity, is, reproduction, research, on, college, students, suggested, that, people, have, sex, for, four, general, reasons, physical, attraction, as, a, means, to, an, end, to, increase, emotional, connection, and, to, alleviate, insecurity, most, people, engage, in, sexual, activity, because, of, pleasure, they, derive, from, the, arousal, of, their, sexuality, especially, if, they, can, achieve, orgasm, sexual, arousal, can, also, be, experienced, from, foreplay, and, flirting, and, from, fetish, or, bdsm, activities, or, other, erotic, activities, most, commonly, people, engage, in, sexual, activity, because, of, the, sexual, desire, generated, by, a, person, to, whom, they, feel,

occurs, between, two, people, who, strongly, dislike, or, annoy, each, other, it, is, related, to, the, idea, that, opposition, between, two, people, can, heighten, sexual, tension, attraction, and, interest, research, has, found, that, people, also, engage, in, sexual, activity, for, reasons, associated, with, self, determination, theory, the, self, determination, theory, can, be, applied, to, a, sexual, relationship, when, the, participants, have, positive, feelings, associated, with, the, relationship, these, participants, do, not, feel, guilty, or, coerced, into, the, partnership, researchers, have, proposed, the, model, of, self, determined, sexual, motivation, the, purpose, of, this, model, is, to, connect, self, determination, and, sexual, motivation, this, model, has, helped, to, explain, how, people, are, sexually, motivated, when, involved, in, self, determined, dating, relationships, this, model, also, links, the, positive, outcomes, satisfying, the, need, for, autonomy, competence, and, relatedness, gained, from, sexual, motivations, according, to, the, completed, research, associated, with, this, model, it, was, found, that, people, of, both, sexes, who, engaged, in, sexual, activity, for, self, determined, motivation, had, more, positive, psychological, well, being, while, engaging, in, sexual, activity, for, self, determined, reasons, the, participants, also, had, a, higher, need, for, fulfillment, when, this, need, was, satisfied, they, felt, better, about, themselves, this, was, correlated, with, greater, closeness, to, their, partner, and, higher, overall, satisfaction, in, their, relationship, though, both, sexes, engaged, in, sexual, activity, for, self, determined, reasons, there, were, some, differences, found, between, males, and, females, it, was, concluded, that, females, had, more, motivation, than, males, to, engage, in, sexual, activity, for, self, determined, reasons, females, also, had, higher, satisfaction, and, relationship, quality, than, males, did, from, the, sexual, activity, overall, research, concluded, that, psychological, well, being, sexual, motivation, and, sexual, satisfaction, were, all, positively, correlated, when, dating, couples, partook, in, sexual, activity, for, self, determined, reasons, the, frequency, of, sexual, activity, might, range, from, zero, to, 15, or, 20, times, a, week, frequency, of, intercourse, tends, to, decline, with, age, some, post, menopausal, women, experience, decline, in, frequency, of, sexual, intercourse, while, others, do, not, according, to, the, kinsey, institute, the, average, frequency, of, sexual, intercourse, in, the, us, for, individuals, with, partners, is, 112, times, per, year, age, 18, 29, 86, times, per, year, age, 30, 39, and, 69, times, per, year, age, 40, 49, the, rate, of, sexual, activity, has, been, declining, in, the, 21st, century, a, phenomenon, that, has, been, described, as, a, sex, recession, the, age, at, which, adolescents, become, sexually, active, varies, considerably, between, different, cultures, and, times, see, prevalence, of, virginity, the, first, sexual, act, of, a, child, or, adolescent, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, sexualization, of, the, child, and, may, be, considered, a, milestone, or, a, change, of, status, as, the, loss, of, virginity, or, innocence, youth, are, legally, free, to, have, intercourse, after, they, reach, the, age, of, consent, a, 1999, survey, of, students, indicated, that, approximately, 40, of, ninth, graders, across, the, united, states, report, having, had, sexual, intercourse, this, figure, rises, with, each, grade, males, are, more, sexually, active, than, females, at, each, of, the, grade, levels, surveyed, sexual, activity, of, young, adolescents, differs, in, ethnicity, as, well, a, higher, percentage, of, african, american, and, hispanic, adolescents, are, more, sexually, active, than, white, adolescents, research, on, sexual, frequency, has, also, been, conducted, solely, on, female, adolescents, who, engage, in, sexual, activity, female, adolescents, tended, to, engage, in, more, sexual, activity, due, to, positive, mood, in, female, teenagers, engaging, in, sexual, activity, was, directly, positively, correlated, with, being, older, greater, sexual, activity, in, the, previous, week, or, prior, day, and, more, positive, mood, the, previous, day, or, the, same, day, as, the, sexual, activity, occurred, decreased, sexual, activity, was, associated, with, prior, or, same, day, negative, mood, or, menstruation, although, opinions, differ, researchers, suggest, that, sexual, activity, is, an, essential, part, of, humans, and, that, teenagers, need, to, experience, sex, according, to, a, study, sexual, experiences, help, teenagers, understand, pleasure, and, satisfaction, in, relation, to, hedonic, and, eudaimonic, well, being, it, stated, that, teenagers, can, positively, benefit, from, sexual, activity, the, cross, sectional, study, was, conducted, in, 2008, and, 2009, at, a, rural, upstate, new, york, community, teenagers, who, had, their, first, sexual, experience, at, age, 16, revealed, a, higher, well, being, than, those, who, were, sexually, inexperienced, or, who, became, sexually, active, at, age, 17, furthermore, teenagers, who, had, their, first, sexual, experience, at, age, 15, or, younger, or, who, had, many, sexual, partners, were, not, negatively, affected, and, did, not, have, associated, lower, well, being, sexual, activity, is, an, innately, physiological, function, but, like, other, physical, activity, it, comes, with, risks, there, are, four, main, types, of, risks, that, may, arise, from, sexual, activity, unwanted, pregnancy,

such, as, during, sexual, intercourse, or, contact, of, semen, with, her, vulva, may, result, in, a, pregnancy, to, reduce, the, risk, of, unintended, pregnancies, some, people, who, engage, in, penile, vaginal, sex, may, use, contraception, such, as, birth, control, pills, a, condom, diaphragms, spermicides, hormonal, contraception, or, sterilization, the, effectiveness, of, the, various, contraceptive, methods, in, avoiding, pregnancy, varies, considerably, and, depends, on, the, method, rather, than, the, user, sexual, activity, that, involves, skin, to, skin, contact, exposure, to, an, infected, person, s, bodily, fluids, or, mucous, membranes, carries, the, risk, of, contracting, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, people, may, not, be, able, to, detect, that, their, sexual, partner, has, one, or, more, stis, for, example, if, they, are, asymptomatic, show, no, symptoms, the, risk, of, stis, can, be, reduced, by, safe, sex, practices, such, as, using, condoms, both, partners, may, opt, to, be, tested, for, stis, before, engaging, in, sex, the, exchange, of, body, fluids, is, not, necessary, to, contract, an, infestation, of, crab, lice, crab, lice, typically,

development, of, the, contraceptive, pill, and, other, highly, effective, forms, of, contraception, in, the, mid, and, late, 20th, century, has, increased, people, s, ability, to, segregate, these, three, functions, which, still, overlap, a, great, deal, and, in, complex, patterns, for, example, a, fertile, couple, may, have, intercourse, while, using, contraception, to, experience, sexual, pleasure, recreational, and, also, as, a, means, of, emotional, intimacy, relational, thus, deepening, their, bonding, making, their, relationship, more, stable, and, more, capable, of, sustaining,

by, couples, activities, and, relationships, within, a, bdsm, context, are, often, characterized, by, the, participants, taking, on, complementary, but, unequal, roles, thus, the, idea, of, informed, consent, of, both, the, partners, becomes, essential, participants, who, exert, dominance, sexual, or, otherwise, over, their, partners, are, known, as, dominants, or, tops, while, participants, who,
