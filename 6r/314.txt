contract, bridge, or, simply, bridge, is, a, plain, trick, taking, card, game, played, with, a, standard, 52, card, deck, it, is, played, by, two, pairs, competing, against, each, other, with, the, partners, facing, each, other, as, in, whist, millions, of, people, play, bridge, worldwide, in, clubs, tournaments, online, and, socially, making, it, one, of, the, world, s, most, popular, card, games, particularly, among, seniors, the, world, bridge, federation, wbf, is, the, governing, body, for, international, competitive, bridge, with, numerous, other, bodies, governing, it, at, national, and, regional, levels, rubber, bridge, is, the, most, popular, for, casual, play, but, most, club, and, tournament, play, is, duplicate, bridge, where, the, same, deal, is, played, at, two, or, more, tables, to, reduce, the, element, of, luck, and, enable, comparative, scoring, for, the, history, of, whist, see, whist, bridge, was, based, on, the, game, of, biritch, or, britch, which, meant, herald, or, announcer, and, referred, to, the, nt, call, in, the, game, britch, was, a, slimmed, down, version, of, the, russian, whist, variant, yeralash, where, dealer, declared, a, trump, suit, or, no, trumps, and, played, their, partner, s, hand, as, a, dummy, like, in, three, player, whist, a, rubber, was, two, games, of, 30, points, or, 3nt, 4, and, 5, although, the, black, suits, were, worth, very, little, biritch, is, reported, to, have, been, played, in, many, places, around, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, even, amongst, the, greek, community, in, london, in, the, 2nd, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, first, recorded, rules, were, published, in, 1886, in, england, by, john, collinson, collinson, was, a, railway, engineer, and, financier, who, had, worked, in, turkiye, where, he, played, biritch, with, russian, migr, s, in, ottoman, constantinople, between, 1880, and, 1884, collinson, s, short, booklet, biritch, or, russian, whist, described, biritch, as, a, set, of, additions, to, short, whist, a, game, which, hadn, t, changed, at, all, in, 150, years, collinson, handed, out, copies, to, friends, but, the, game, didn, t, spread, beyond, his, immediate, circle, c, 1890, another, variant, of, britch, where, no, trumps, scored, 12, points, a, trick, became, popular, in, paris, it, spread, to, new, york, and, london, in, 1894, lord, brougham, pushed, for, the, game, now, anglicised, as, bridge, to, be, adopted, at, the, portland, club, in, london, and, in, 1895, the, portland, club, published, an, official, laws, of, bridge, this, introduced, advances, in, card, games, from, eastern, europe, like, suit, hierarchies, for, trick, points, declaring, contracts, and, doubling, to, england, the, dummy, in, bridge, made, play, easier, and, rendered, whist, s, complicated, rules, for, leads, following, and, signally, largely, irrelevant, adding, bidding, to, bridge, began, around, 1900, in, bath, and, auction, bridge, was, reportedly, being, played, there, by, 1904, negotiations, began, with, the, portland, club, for, a, set, of, rules, but, portland, refused, to, accept, any, change, that, contradicted, any, of, their, 1895, laws, a, set, of, additional, rules, covering, bidding, was, not, approved, until, 1908, it, ranked, bids, by, trick, value, then, level, so, that, 1, overcalled, 3, and, a, 4, bid, was, needed, to, overcall, 1, the, american, insisted, on, sensibly, ranking, bids, by, level, then, suit, hierarchy, and, also, began, using, spade, bids, conventionally, to, show, strong, heart, hands, so, the, whist, club, of, new, york, began, issuing, its, own, rival, laws, there, were, several, attempts, to, change, the, scoring, until, in, 1918, milton, work, and, other, players, and, writers, in, new, york, proposed, a, major, revision, to, the, rules, the, result, was, royal, auction, bridge, with, the, new, count, that, made, spades, the, highest, ranking, suit, and, fixed, the, problems, books, on, the, game, were, widely, published, in, 1920, after, wwi, and, the, influenza, pandemic, had, suspended, printing, and, bridge, finally, looked, something, like, the, modern, game, harold, stirling, vanderbilt, after, a, failed, attempt, to, introduce, plafond, a, french, contract, bridge, variant, in, new, york, worked, on, a, new, unified, scoring, system, for, bridge, it, was, designed, for, contract, and, introduced, vulnerability, which, made, it, harder, for, the, pair, who, won, the, first, game, to, win, the, rubber, vanderbilt, s, new, scoring, system, was, popular, in, new, york, and, accepted, there, in, late, in, 1928, it, was, accepted, by, portland, in, 1929, and, international, rules, were, agreed, between, the, us, and, continental, europe, in, 1932, 1935, bridge, is, a, member, of, the, family, of, trick, taking, games, and, is, a, derivative, of, whist, which, had, become, the, dominant, such, game, and, enjoyed, a, loyal, following, for, centuries, the, idea, of, a, trick, taking, 52, card, game, has, its, first, documented, origins, in, italy, and, france, the, french, physician, and, author, rabelais, 1493, 1553, mentions, a, game, called, la, triomphe, in, one, of, his, works, also, juan, luis, vives, in, his, linguae, latinae, exercitio, exercise, in, the, latin, language, of, 1539, has, a, dialogue, on, card, games, where, the, characters, play, triumphus, hispanicus, spanish, triumph, bridge, departed, from, whist, with, the, creation, of, biritch, in, the, 19th, century, and, evolved, through, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, to, form, the, present, game, the, first, rule, book, for, bridge, dated, 1886, is, biritch, or, russian, whist, written, by, john, collinson, an, english, financier, working, in, ottoman, constantinople, it, and, his, subsequent, letter, to, the, saturday, review, dated, 28, may, 1906, document, the, origin, of, biritch, as, being, the, russian, community, in, constantinople, the, word, biritch, is, thought, to, be, a, transliteration, of, the, russian, word, an, occupation, of, a, diplomatic, clerk, or, an, announcer, another, theory, is, that, british, soldiers, invented, the, game, bridge, while, serving, in, the, crimean, war, and, named, it, after, the, galata, bridge, which, they, crossed, on, their, way, to, a, coffeehouse, to, play, cards, biritch, had, many, significant, bridge, like, developments, dealer, chose, the, trump, suit, or, nominated, his, partner, to, do, so, there, was, a, call, of, no, trumps, biritch, dealer, s, partner, s, hand, became, dummy, points, were, scored, above, and, below, the, line, game, was, 3nt, 4, and, 5, although, 8, club, odd, tricks, and, 15, spade, odd, tricks, were, needed, the, score, could, be, doubled, and, redoubled, and, there, were, slam, bonuses, it, has, some, features, in, common, with, solo, whist, this, game, and, variants, of, it, known, as, bridge, and, bridge, whist, became, popular, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, in, the, 1890s, despite, the, long, established, dominance, of, whist, its, breakthrough, was, its, acceptance, in, 1894, by, lord, brougham, at, london, s, portland, club, in, 1904, auction, bridge, was, developed, in, which, the, players, bid, in, a, competitive, auction, to, decide, the, contract, and, declarer, the, object, became, to, make, at, least, as, many, tricks, as, were, contracted, for, and, penalties, were, introduced, for, failing, to, do, so, auction, bridge, bidding, beyond, winning, the, auction, is, pointless, if, taking, all, 13, tricks, there, is, no, difference, in, score, between, a, 1, and, a, 7, final, bid, as, the, bonus, for, rubber, small, slam, or, grand, slam, depends, on, the, number, of, tricks, taken, rather, than, the, number, of, tricks, bid, the, modern, game, of, contract, bridge, was, the, result, of, innovations, to, the, scoring, of, auction, bridge, by, harold, stirling, vanderbilt, and, others, the, most, significant, change, was, that, only, the, tricks, contracted, for, were, scored, below, the, line, toward, game, or, a, slam, bonus, a, change, that, resulted, in, bidding, becoming, much, more, challenging, and, interesting, also, new, was, the, concept, of, vulnerability, making, sacrifices, to, protect, the, lead, in, a, rubber, more, expensive, the, various, scores, were, adjusted, to, produce, a, more, balanced, and, interesting, game, vanderbilt, set, out, his, rules, in, 1925, and, within, a, few, years, contract, bridge, had, so, supplanted, other, forms, of, the, game, that, bridge, became, synonymous, with, contract, bridge, the, form, of, bridge, mostly, played, in, clubs, tournaments, and, online, is, duplicate, bridge, the, number, of, people, playing, contract, bridge, has, declined, since, its, peak, in, the, 1940s, when, a, survey, found, it, was, played, in, 44, of, us, households, the, game, is, still, widely, played, especially, amongst, retirees, and, in, 2005, the, acbl, estimated, there, were, 25, million, players, in, the, us, bridge, is, a, four, player, partnership, trick, taking, game, with, thirteen, tricks, per, deal, the, dominant, variations, of, the, game, are, rubber, bridge, more, common, in, social, play, and, duplicate, bridge, which, enables, comparative, scoring, in, tournament, play, each, player, is, dealt, thirteen, cards, from, a, standard, 52, card, deck, a, trick, starts, when, a, player, leads, i, e, plays, the, first, card, the, leader, to, the, first, trick, is, determined, by, the, auction, the, leader, to, each, subsequent, trick, is, the, player, who, won, the, preceding, trick, each, player, in, clockwise, order, plays, one, card, on, the, trick, players, must, play, a, card, of, the, same, suit, as, the, original, card, led, unless, they, have, none, said, to, be, void, in, which, case, they, may, play, any, card, the, player, who, played, the, highest, ranked, card, wins, the, trick, within, a, suit, the, ace, is, ranked, highest, followed, by, the, king, queen, and, jack, and, then, the, ten, through, to, the, two, in, a, deal, where, the, auction, has, determined, that, there, is, no, trump, suit, the, trick, must, be, won, by, a, card, of, the, suit, led, in, a, deal, with, a, trump, suit, cards, of, that, suit, are, superior, in, rank, to, any, of, the, cards, of, any, other, suit, if, one, or, more, players, plays, a, trump, to, a, trick, when, void, in, the, suit, led, the, highest, trump, wins, for, example, if, the, trump, suit, is, spades, and, a, player, is, void, in, the, suit, led, and, plays, a, spade, card, they, win, the, trick, if, no, other, player, plays, a, higher, spade, if, a, trump, suit, is, led, the, usual, rule, for, trick, taking, applies, unlike, its, predecessor, whist, the, goal, of, bridge, is, not, simply, to, take, the, most, tricks, in, a, deal, instead, the, goal, is, to, successfully, estimate, how, many, tricks, one, s, partnership, can, take, to, illustrate, this, the, simpler, partnership, trick, taking, game, of, spades, has, a, similar, mechanism, the, usual, trick, taking, rules, apply, with, the, trump, suit, being, spades, but, in, the, beginning, of, the, game, players, bid, or, estimate, how, many, tricks, they, can, win, and, the, number, of, tricks, bid, by, both, players, in, a, partnership, are, added, if, a, partnership, takes, at, least, that, many, tricks, they, receive, points, for, the, round, otherwise, they, lose, penalty, points, bridge, extends, the, concept, of, bidding, into, an, auction, where, partnerships, compete, to, take, a, contract, specifying, how, many, tricks, they, will, need, to, take, in, order, to, receive, points, and, also, specifying, the, trump, suit, or, no, trump, meaning, that, there, will, be, no, trump, suit, players, take, turns, to, call, in, a, clockwise, order, each, player, in, turn, either, passes, doubles, which, increases, the, penalties, for, not, making, the, contract, specified, by, the, opposing, partnership, s, last, bid, but, also, increases, the, reward, for, making, it, or, redoubles, or, states, a, contract, that, their, partnership, will, adopt, which, must, be, higher, than, the, previous, highest, bid, if, any, eventually, the, player, who, bid, the, highest, contract, which, is, determined, by, the, contract, s, level, as, well, as, the, trump, suit, or, no, trump, wins, the, contract, for, their, partnership, in, the, example, auction, below, the, east, west, pair, secures, the, contract, of, 6, the, auction, concludes, when, there, have, been, three, successive, passes, note, that, six, tricks, are, added, to, contract, values, so, the, six, level, contract, is, a, contract, of, twelve, tricks, in, practice, establishing, a, contract, without, enough, information, on, the, other, partner, s, hand, is, difficult, so, there, exist, many, bidding, systems, assigning, meanings, to, bids, with, common, ones, including, standard, american, acol, and, 2, 1, game, forcing, contrast, with, spades, where, players, only, have, to, bid, their, own, hand, after, the, contract, is, decided, and, the, first, lead, is, made, the, declarer, s, partner, dummy, lays, their, cards, face, up, on, the, table, and, the, declarer, plays, the, dummy, s, cards, as, well, as, their, own, the, opposing, partnership, is, called, the, defenders, and, their, goal, is, to, stop, the, declarer, from, fulfilling, his, contract, once, all, the, cards, have, been, played, the, hand, is, scored, if, the, declaring, side, makes, their, contract, they, receive, points, based, on, the, level, of, the, contract, with, some, trump, suits, being, worth, more, points, than, others, and, no, trump, being, the, highest, as, well, as, bonus, points, for, overtricks, if, the, declarer, fails, to, fulfill, the, contract, the, defenders, receive, points, depending, on, the, declaring, side, s, undertricks, the, number, of, tricks, short, of, the, contract, and, whether, the, contract, was, doubled, by, the, defenders, the, four, players, sit, in, two, partnerships, with, players, sitting, opposite, their, partners, a, cardinal, direction, is, assigned, to, each, seat, so, that, one, partnership, sits, in, north, and, south, while, the, other, sits, in, west, and, east, the, cards, may, be, freshly, dealt, or, in, duplicate, bridge, games, pre, dealt, all, that, is, needed, in, basic, games, are, the, cards, and, a, method, of, keeping, score, but, there, is, often, other, equipment, on, the, table, such, as, a, board, containing, the, cards, to, be, played, in, duplicate, bridge, bidding, boxes, or, screens, in, rubber, bridge, each, player, draws, a, card, at, the, start, of, the, game, the, player, who, draws, the, highest, card, deals, first, the, second, highest, card, becomes, the, dealer, s, partner, and, takes, the, chair, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, table, they, play, against, the, other, two, the, deck, is, shuffled, and, cut, usually, by, the, player, to, the, left, of, the, dealer, before, dealing, players, take, turns, to, deal, in, clockwise, order, the, dealer, deals, the, cards, clockwise, one, card, at, a, time, normally, rubber, bridge, is, played, with, two, packs, of, cards, and, whilst, one, pack, is, being, dealt, the, dealer, s, partner, shuffles, the, other, pack, after, shuffling, the, pack, is, placed, on, the, right, ready, for, the, next, dealer, before, dealing, the, next, dealer, passes, the, cards, to, the, previous, dealer, who, cuts, them, in, duplicate, bridge, the, cards, are, pre, dealt, either, by, hand, or, by, a, computerized, dealing, machine, in, order, to, allow, for, competitive, scoring, once, dealt, the, cards, are, placed, in, a, device, called, a, board, having, slots, designated, for, each, player, s, cardinal, direction, seating, position, after, a, deal, has, been, played, players, return, their, cards, to, the, appropriate, slot, in, the, board, ready, to, be, played, by, the, next, table, the, dealer, opens, the, auction, and, can, make, the, first, call, and, the, auction, proceeds, clockwise, when, it, is, their, turn, to, call, a, player, may, pass, but, can, enter, into, the, bidding, later, or, bid, a, contract, specifying, the, level, of, their, contract, and, either, the, trump, suit, or, no, trump, the, denomination, provided, that, it, is, higher, than, the, last, bid, by, any, player, including, their, partner, all, bids, promise, to, take, a, number, of, tricks, in, excess, of, six, so, a, bid, must, be, between, one, seven, tricks, and, seven, thirteen, tricks, a, bid, is, higher, than, another, bid, if, either, the, level, is, greater, e, g, 2, over, 1nt, or, the, denomination, is, higher, with, the, order, being, in, ascending, or, alphabetical, order, and, nt, no, trump, calls, may, be, made, orally, or, with, a, bidding, box, if, the, last, bid, was, by, the, opposing, partnership, one, may, also, double, the, opponents, bid, increasing, the, penalties, for, undertricks, but, also, increasing, the, reward, for, making, the, contract, doubling, does, not, carry, to, future, bids, by, the, opponents, unless, future, bids, are, doubled, again, a, player, on, the, opposing, partnership, being, doubled, may, also, redouble, which, increases, the, penalties, and, rewards, further, players, may, not, see, their, partner, s, hand, during, the, auction, only, their, own, there, exist, many, bidding, conventions, that, assign, agreed, meanings, to, various, calls, to, assist, players, in, reaching, an, optimal, contract, or, obstruct, the, opponents, the, auction, ends, when, after, a, player, bids, doubles, or, redoubles, every, other, player, has, passed, in, which, case, the, action, proceeds, to, the, play, or, every, player, has, passed, and, no, bid, has, been, made, in, which, case, the, round, is, considered, to, be, passed, out, and, not, played, the, player, from, the, declaring, side, who, first, bid, the, denomination, named, in, the, final, contract, becomes, declarer, the, player, left, to, the, declarer, leads, to, the, first, trick, dummy, then, lays, his, or, her, cards, face, up, on, the, table, organized, in, columns, by, suit, play, proceeds, clockwise, with, each, player, required, to, follow, suit, if, possible, tricks, are, won, by, the, highest, trump, or, if, there, were, none, played, the, highest, card, of, the, led, suit, the, player, who, won, the, previous, trick, leads, to, the, next, trick, the, declarer, has, control, of, the, dummy, s, cards, and, tells, his, partner, which, card, to, play, at, dummy, s, turn, there, also, exist, conventions, that, communicate, further, information, between, defenders, about, their, hands, during, the, play, at, any, time, a, player, may, claim, stating, that, their, side, will, win, a, specific, number, of, the, remaining, tricks, the, claiming, player, lays, his, cards, down, on, the, table, and, explains, the, order, in, which, he, intends, to, play, the, remaining, cards, the, opponents, can, either, accept, the, claim, and, the, round, is, scored, accordingly, or, dispute, the, claim, if, the, claim, is, disputed, play, continues, with, the, claiming, player, s, cards, face, up, in, rubber, games, or, in, duplicate, games, play, ceases, and, the, tournament, director, is, called, to, adjudicate, the, hand, at, the, end, of, the, hand, points, are, awarded, to, the, declaring, side, if, they, make, the, contract, or, else, to, the, defenders, partnerships, can, be, vulnerable, increasing, the, rewards, for, making, the, contract, but, also, increasing, the, penalties, for, undertricks, in, rubber, bridge, if, a, side, has, won, 100, contract, points, they, have, won, a, game, and, are, vulnerable, for, the, remaining, rounds, but, in, duplicate, bridge, vulnerability, is, predetermined, based, on, the, number, of, each, board, if, the, declaring, side, makes, their, contract, they, receive, points, for, odd, tricks, or, tricks, bid, and, made, in, excess, of, six, in, both, rubber, and, duplicate, bridge, the, declaring, side, is, awarded, 20, points, per, odd, trick, for, a, contract, in, clubs, or, diamonds, and, 30, points, per, odd, trick, for, a, contract, in, hearts, or, spades, for, a, contract, in, notrump, the, declaring, side, is, awarded, 40, points, for, the, first, odd, trick, and, 30, points, for, the, remaining, odd, tricks, contract, points, are, doubled, or, quadrupled, if, the, contract, is, respectively, doubled, or, redoubled, in, rubber, bridge, a, partnership, wins, one, game, once, it, has, accumulated, 100, contract, points, excess, contract, points, do, not, carry, over, to, the, next, game, a, partnership, that, wins, two, games, wins, the, rubber, receiving, a, bonus, of, 500, points, if, the, opponents, have, won, a, game, and, 700, points, if, they, have, not, overtricks, score, the, same, number, of, points, per, odd, trick, although, their, doubled, and, redoubled, values, differ, bonuses, vary, between, the, two, bridge, variations, both, in, score, and, in, type, for, example, rubber, bridge, awards, a, bonus, for, holding, a, certain, combination, of, high, cards, although, some, are, common, between, the, two, a, larger, bonus, is, awarded, if, the, declaring, side, makes, a, small, slam, or, grand, slam, a, contract, of, 12, or, 13, tricks, respectively, if, the, declaring, side, is, not, vulnerable, a, small, slam, gets, 500, points, and, a, grand, slam, 1000, points, if, the, declaring, side, is, vulnerable, a, small, slam, is, 750, points, and, a, grand, slam, is, 1, 500, in, rubber, bridge, the, rubber, finishes, when, a, partnership, has, won, two, games, but, the, partnership, receiving, the, most, overall, points, wins, the, rubber, duplicate, bridge, is, scored, comparatively, meaning, that, the, score, for, the, hand, is, compared, to, other, tables, playing, the, same, cards, and, match, points, are, scored, according, to, the, comparative, results, usually, either, matchpoint, scoring, where, each, partnership, receives, 2, points, or, 1, point, for, each, pair, that, they, beat, and, 1, point, or, 1, 2, point, for, each, tie, or, imps, international, matchpoint, scoring, where, the, number, of, imps, varies, but, less, than, proportionately, with, the, points, difference, between, the, teams, undertricks, are, scored, in, both, variations, as, follows, the, rules, of, the, game, are, referred, to, as, the, laws, as, promulgated, by, various, bridge, organizations, the, official, rules, of, duplicate, bridge, are, promulgated, by, the, wbf, as, the, laws, of, duplicate, bridge, 2017, the, laws, committee, of, the, wbf, composed, of, world, experts, updates, the, laws, every, 10, years, it, also, issues, a, laws, commentary, advising, on, interpretations, it, has, rendered, in, addition, to, the, basic, rules, of, play, there, are, many, additional, rules, covering, playing, conditions, and, the, rectification, of, irregularities, which, are, primarily, for, use, by, tournament, directors, who, act, as, referees, and, have, overall, control, of, procedures, during, competitions, but, various, details, of, procedure, are, left, to, the, discretion, of, the, zonal, bridge, organisation, for, tournaments, under, their, aegis, and, some, for, example, the, choice, of, movement, to, the, sponsoring, organisation, for, example, the, club, some, zonal, organisations, of, the, wbf, also, publish, editions, of, the, laws, for, example, the, american, contract, bridge, league, acbl, publishes, the, laws, of, duplicate, bridge, and, additional, documentation, for, club, and, tournament, directors, there, are, no, universally, accepted, rules, for, rubber, bridge, but, some, zonal, organisations, have, published, their, own, an, example, for, those, wishing, to, abide, by, a, published, standard, is, the, laws, of, rubber, bridge, as, published, by, the, american, contract, bridge, league, the, majority, of, rules, mirror, those, of, duplicate, bridge, in, the, bidding, and, play, and, differ, primarily, in, procedures, for, dealing, and, scoring, in, 2001, the, wbf, promulgated, a, set, of, laws, for, online, play, bridge, is, a, game, of, skill, played, with, randomly, dealt, cards, which, makes, it, also, a, game, of, chance, or, more, exactly, a, tactical, game, with, inbuilt, randomness, imperfect, knowledge, and, restricted, communication, the, chance, element, is, in, the, deal, of, the, cards, in, duplicate, bridge, some, of, the, chance, element, is, eliminated, by, comparing, results, of, multiple, pairs, in, identical, situations, this, is, achievable, when, there, are, eight, or, more, players, sitting, at, two, or, more, tables, and, the, deals, from, each, table, are, preserved, and, passed, to, the, next, table, thereby, duplicating, them, for, the, other, table, s, of, players, at, the, end, of, a, session, the, scores, for, each, deal, are, compared, and, the, most, points, are, awarded, to, the, players, doing, the, best, with, each, particular, deal, this, measures, relative, skill, but, still, with, an, element, of, luck, because, each, pair, or, team, is, being, judged, only, on, the, ability, to, bid, with, and, play, the, same, cards, as, other, players, duplicate, bridge, is, played, in, clubs, and, tournaments, which, can, gather, as, many, as, several, hundred, players, duplicate, bridge, is, a, mind, sport, and, its, popularity, gradually, became, comparable, to, that, of, chess, with, which, it, is, often, compared, for, its, complexity, and, the, mental, skills, required, for, high, level, competition, bridge, and, chess, are, the, only, mind, sports, recognized, by, the, international, olympic, committee, although, they, were, not, found, eligible, for, the, main, olympic, program, in, october, 2017, the, british, high, court, ruled, against, the, english, bridge, union, finding, that, bridge, is, not, a, sport, under, a, definition, of, sport, as, involving, physical, activity, but, did, not, rule, on, the, broad, somewhat, philosophical, question, as, to, whether, or, not, bridge, is, a, sport, the, basic, premise, of, duplicate, bridge, had, previously, been, used, for, whist, matches, as, early, as, 1857, initially, bridge, was, not, thought, to, be, suitable, for, duplicate, competition, it, was, not, until, the, 1920s, that, auction, bridge, tournaments, became, popular, in, 1925, when, contract, bridge, first, evolved, bridge, tournaments, were, becoming, popular, but, the, rules, were, somewhat, in, flux, and, several, different, organizing, bodies, were, involved, in, tournament, sponsorship, the, american, bridge, league, formerly, the, american, auction, bridge, league, which, changed, its, name, in, 1929, the, american, whist, league, and, the, united, states, bridge, association, in, 1935, the, first, officially, recognized, world, championship, was, held, in, 1958, the, world, bridge, federation, wbf, was, founded, to, promote, bridge, worldwide, coordinate, periodic, revision, to, the, laws, each, ten, years, next, in, 2027, and, conduct, world, championships, in, tournaments, bidding, boxes, are, frequently, used, as, noted, above, these, avoid, the, possibility, of, players, at, other, tables, hearing, any, spoken, bids, the, bidding, cards, are, laid, out, in, sequence, as, the, auction, progresses, although, it, is, not, a, formal, rule, many, clubs, adopt, a, protocol, that, the, bidding, cards, stay, revealed, until, the, first, playing, card, is, tabled, after, which, point, the, bidding, cards, are, put, away, bidding, pads, are, an, alternative, to, bidding, boxes, a, bidding, pad, is, a, block, of, 100mm, square, tear, off, sheets, players, write, their, bids, on, the, top, sheet, when, the, first, trick, is, complete, the, sheet, is, torn, off, and, discarded, in, top, national, and, international, events, bidding, screens, are, used, these, are, placed, diagonally, across, the, table, preventing, partners, from, seeing, each, other, during, the, game, often, the, screen, is, removed, after, the, auction, is, complete, much, of, the, complexity, in, bridge, arises, from, the, difficulty, of, arriving, at, a, good, final, contract, in, the, auction, or, deciding, to, let, the, opponents, declare, the, contract, this, is, a, difficult, problem, the, two, players, in, a, partnership, must, try, to, communicate, enough, information, about, their, hands, to, arrive, at, a, makeable, contract, but, the, information, they, can, exchange, is, restricted, information, may, be, passed, only, by, the, calls, made, and, later, by, the, cards, played, not, by, other, means, in, addition, the, agreed, upon, meaning, of, each, call, and, play, must, be, available, to, the, opponents, since, a, partnership, that, has, freedom, to, bid, gradually, at, leisure, can, exchange, more, information, and, since, a, partnership, that, can, interfere, with, the, opponents, bidding, as, by, raising, the, bidding, level, rapidly, can, cause, difficulties, for, their, opponents, bidding, systems, are, both, informational, and, strategic, it, is, this, mixture, of, information, exchange, and, evaluation, deduction, and, tactics, that, is, at, the, heart, of, bidding, in, bridge, a, number, of, basic, rules, of, thumb, in, bridge, bidding, and, play, are, summarized, as, bridge, maxims, a, bidding, system, is, a, set, of, partnership, agreements, on, the, meanings, of, bids, a, partnership, s, bidding, system, is, usually, made, up, of, a, core, system, modified, and, complemented, by, specific, conventions, optional, customizations, incorporated, into, the, main, system, for, handling, specific, bidding, situations, which, are, pre, chosen, between, the, partners, prior, to, play, the, line, between, a, well, known, convention, and, a, part, of, a, system, is, not, always, clear, cut, some, bidding, systems, include, specified, conventions, by, default, bidding, systems, can, be, divided, into, mainly, natural, systems, such, as, acol, and, standard, american, and, mainly, artificial, systems, such, as, the, precision, club, and, polish, club, calls, are, usually, considered, to, be, either, natural, or, conventional, artificial, a, natural, call, carries, a, meaning, that, reflects, the, call, a, natural, bid, intuitively, showing, hand, or, suit, strength, based, on, the, level, or, suit, of, the, bid, and, a, natural, double, expressing, that, the, player, believes, that, the, opposing, partnership, will, not, make, their, contract, by, contrast, a, conventional, artificial, call, offers, and, or, asks, for, information, by, means, of, pre, agreed, coded, interpretations, in, which, some, calls, convey, very, specific, information, or, requests, that, are, not, part, of, the, natural, meaning, of, the, call, thus, in, response, to, 4nt, a, natural, bid, of, 5, would, state, a, preference, towards, a, diamond, suit, or, a, desire, to, play, in, five, diamonds, whereas, if, the, partners, have, agreed, to, use, the, common, blackwood, convention, a, bid, of, 5, in, the, same, situation, would, say, nothing, about, the, diamond, suit, but, would, tell, the, partner, that, the, hand, in, question, contains, exactly, one, ace, conventions, are, valuable, in, bridge, because, of, the, need, to, pass, information, beyond, a, simple, like, or, dislike, of, a, particular, suit, and, because, the, limited, bidding, space, can, be, used, more, efficiently, by, adopting, a, conventional, artificial, meaning, for, a, given, call, where, a, natural, meaning, has, less, utility, because, the, information, it, conveys, is, not, valuable, or, because, the, desire, to, convey, that, information, arises, only, rarely, the, conventional, meaning, conveys, more, useful, or, more, frequently, useful, information, there, are, a, very, large, number, of, conventions, from, which, players, can, choose, many, books, have, been, written, detailing, bidding, conventions, well, known, conventions, include, stayman, to, ask, the, opening, 1nt, bidder, to, show, any, four, card, major, suit, jacoby, transfers, a, request, by, usually, the, weak, hand, for, the, partner, to, bid, a, particular, suit, first, and, therefore, to, become, the, declarer, and, the, blackwood, convention, to, ask, for, information, on, the, number, of, aces, and, kings, held, used, in, slam, bidding, situations, the, term, preempt, refers, to, a, high, level, tactical, bid, by, a, weak, hand, relying, upon, a, very, long, suit, rather, than, high, cards, for, tricks, preemptive, bids, serve, a, double, purpose, they, allow, players, to, indicate, they, are, bidding, on, the, basis, of, a, long, suit, in, an, otherwise, weak, hand, which, is, important, information, to, share, and, they, also, consume, substantial, bidding, space, which, prevents, a, possibly, strong, opposing, pair, from, exchanging, information, on, their, cards, several, systems, include, the, use, of, opening, bids, or, other, early, bids, with, weak, hands, including, long, usually, six, to, eight, card, suits, at, the, 2, 3, or, even, 4, or, 5, levels, as, preempts, as, a, rule, a, natural, suit, bid, indicates, a, holding, of, at, least, four, or, more, depending, on, the, situation, and, the, system, cards, in, that, suit, as, an, opening, bid, or, a, lesser, number, when, supporting, partner, a, natural, nt, bid, indicates, a, balanced, hand, most, systems, use, a, count, of, high, card, points, as, the, basic, evaluation, of, the, strength, of, a, hand, refining, this, by, reference, to, shape, and, distribution, if, appropriate, in, the, most, commonly, used, point, count, system, aces, are, counted, as, 4, points, kings, as, 3, queens, as, 2, and, jacks, as, 1, point, therefore, the, deck, contains, 40, points, in, addition, the, distribution, of, the, cards, in, a, hand, into, suits, may, also, contribute, to, the, strength, of, a, hand, and, be, counted, as, distribution, points, a, better, than, average, hand, containing, 12, or, 13, points, is, usually, considered, sufficient, to, open, the, bidding, i, e, to, make, the, first, bid, in, the, auction, a, combination, of, two, such, hands, i, e, 25, or, 26, points, shared, between, partners, is, often, sufficient, for, a, partnership, to, bid, and, generally, to, make, game, in, a, major, suit, or, notrump, more, are, usually, needed, for, a, minor, suit, game, as, the, level, is, higher, in, natural, systems, a, 1nt, opening, bid, usually, reflects, a, hand, that, has, a, relatively, balanced, shape, usually, between, two, and, four, or, less, often, five, cards, in, each, suit, and, a, sharply, limited, number, of, high, card, points, usually, somewhere, between, 12, and, 18, the, most, common, ranges, use, a, span, of, exactly, three, points, for, example, 12, 14, 15, 17, or, 16, 18, but, some, systems, use, a, four, point, range, usually, 15, 18, opening, bids, of, three, or, higher, are, preemptive, bids, i, e, bids, made, with, weak, hands, that, especially, favor, a, particular, suit, opened, at, a, high, level, in, order, to, define, the, hand, s, value, quickly, and, to, frustrate, the, opposition, for, example, a, hand, of, kqj9872, 7, 42, 763, would, be, a, candidate, for, an, opening, bid, of, 3, designed, to, make, it, difficult, for, the, opposing, team, to, bid, and, find, their, optimum, contract, even, if, they, have, the, bulk, of, the, points, this, hand, is, nearly, valueless, unless, spades, are, trumps, but, it, contains, good, enough, spades, that, the, penalty, for, being, set, should, not, be, higher, than, the, value, of, an, opponent, game, the, high, card, weakness, makes, it, likely, that, the, opponents, have, enough, strength, to, make, game, themselves, openings, at, the, 2, level, are, either, unusually, strong, 2nt, natural, and, 2, artificial, or, preemptive, depending, on, the, system, unusually, strong, bids, communicate, an, especially, high, number, of, points, normally, 20, or, more, or, a, high, trick, taking, potential, normally, 8, or, more, also, 2, as, the, strongest, by, hcp, and, by, dp, hcp, has, become, more, common, perhaps, especially, at, websites, that, offer, duplicate, bridge, here, the, 2, opening, is, used, for, either, hands, with, a, good, 6, card, suit, or, longer, max, one, losing, card, and, a, total, of, 18, hcp, up, to, 23, total, points, or, 2, 1, 2, nt, like, 2nt, but, with, 22, 23, hcp, whilst, the, 2, opening, bid, takes, care, of, all, hands, with, 24, points, hcp, or, with, distribution, points, included, with, the, only, exception, of, gambling, 3nt, opening, bids, at, the, one, level, are, made, with, hands, containing, 12, 13, points, or, more, and, which, are, not, suitable, for, one, of, the, preceding, bids, using, standard, american, with, 5, card, majors, opening, hearts, or, spades, usually, promises, a, 5, card, suit, partnerships, who, agree, to, play, 5, card, majors, open, a, minor, suit, with, 4, card, majors, and, then, bid, their, major, suit, at, the, next, opportunity, this, means, that, an, opening, bid, of, 1, or, 1, will, sometimes, be, made, with, only, 3, cards, in, that, suit, doubles, are, sometimes, given, conventional, meanings, in, otherwise, mostly, natural, systems, a, natural, or, penalty, double, is, one, used, to, try, to, gain, extra, points, when, the, defenders, are, confident, of, setting, defeating, the, contract, the, most, common, example, of, a, conventional, double, is, the, takeout, double, of, a, low, level, suit, bid, implying, support, for, the, unbid, suits, or, the, unbid, major, suits, and, asking, partner, to, choose, one, of, them, bidding, systems, depart, from, these, basic, ideas, in, varying, degrees, standard, american, for, instance, is, a, collection, of, conventions, designed, to, bolster, the, accuracy, and, power, of, these, basic, ideas, while, precision, club, is, a, system, that, uses, the, 1, opening, bid, for, all, or, almost, all, strong, hands, but, sets, the, threshold, for, strong, rather, lower, than, most, other, systems, usually, 16, high, card, points, and, may, include, other, artificial, calls, to, handle, other, situations, but, it, may, contain, natural, calls, as, well, many, experts, today, use, a, system, called, 2, 1, game, forcing, enunciated, as, two, over, one, game, forcing, which, amongst, other, features, adds, some, complexity, to, the, treatment, of, the, one, notrump, response, as, used, in, standard, american, in, the, uk, acol, is, the, most, common, system, its, main, features, are, a, weak, one, notrump, opening, with, 12, 14, high, card, points, and, several, variations, for, 2, level, openings, there, are, also, a, variety, of, advanced, techniques, used, for, hand, evaluation, the, most, basic, is, the, milton, work, point, count, the, 4, 3, 2, 1, system, detailed, above, but, this, is, sometimes, modified, in, various, ways, or, either, augmented, or, replaced, by, other, approaches, such, as, losing, trick, count, honor, point, count, law, of, total, tricks, or, zar, points, common, conventions, and, variations, within, natural, systems, include, within, play, it, is, also, commonly, agreed, what, systems, of, opening, leads, signals, and, discards, will, be, played, every, call, including, pass, also, sometimes, called, no, bid, serves, two, purposes, it, confirms, or, passes, some, information, to, a, partner, and, by, implication, denies, any, other, kind, of, hand, which, would, have, tended, to, support, an, alternative, call, for, example, a, bid, of, 2nt, immediately, after, partner, s, 1nt, not, only, shows, a, balanced, hand, of, a, certain, point, range, but, also, almost, always, denies, possession, of, a, five, card, major, suit, otherwise, the, player, would, have, bid, it, or, even, a, four, card, major, suit, in, that, case, the, player, should, use, the, stayman, convention, likewise, in, some, partnerships, the, bid, of, 2, in, the, sequence, 1nt, 2, 2, 2, between, partners, opponents, passing, throughout, explicitly, shows, five, hearts, but, also, confirms, four, cards, in, spades, the, bidder, must, hold, at, least, five, hearts, to, make, it, worth, looking, for, a, heart, fit, after, 2, denied, a, four, card, major, and, with, at, least, five, hearts, a, stayman, bid, must, have, been, justified, by, having, exactly, four, spades, the, other, major, since, stayman, as, used, by, this, partnership, is, not, useful, with, anything, except, a, four, card, major, suit, thus, an, astute, partner, can, read, much, more, than, the, surface, meaning, into, the, bidding, alternatively, many, partnerships, play, this, same, bidding, sequence, as, crawling, stayman, by, which, the, responder, shows, a, weak, hand, less, than, eight, high, card, points, with, shortness, in, diamonds, but, at, least, four, hearts, and, four, spades, the, opening, bidder, may, correct, to, spades, if, that, appears, to, be, the, better, contract, the, situations, detailed, here, are, extremely, simple, examples, many, instances, of, advanced, bidding, involve, specific, agreements, related, to, very, specific, situations, and, subtle, inferences, regarding, entire, sequences, of, calls, terence, reese, a, prolific, author, of, bridge, books, points, out, that, there, are, only, four, ways, of, taking, a, trick, by, force, two, of, which, are, very, easy, nearly, all, trick, taking, techniques, in, bridge, can, be, reduced, to, one, of, these, four, methods, the, optimum, play, of, the, cards, can, require, much, thought, and, experience, and, is, the, subject, of, whole, books, on, bridge, the, cards, are, dealt, as, shown, in, the, bridge, hand, diagram, north, is, the, dealer, and, starts, the, auction, which, proceeds, as, shown, in, the, bidding, table, n, w, e, s, as, neither, north, nor, east, have, sufficient, strength, to, open, the, bidding, they, each, pass, denying, such, strength, south, next, in, turn, opens, with, the, bid, of, 1, which, denotes, a, reasonable, heart, suit, at, least, 4, or, 5, cards, long, depending, on, the, bidding, system, and, at, least, 12, high, card, points, on, this, hand, south, has, 14, high, card, points, west, overcalls, with, 1, since, he, has, a, long, spade, suit, of, reasonable, quality, and, 10, high, card, points, an, overcall, can, be, made, on, a, hand, that, is, not, quite, strong, enough, for, an, opening, bid, north, supports, partner, s, suit, with, 2, showing, heart, support, and, about, 6, 8, points, east, supports, spades, with, 2, south, inserts, a, game, try, of, 3, inviting, the, partner, to, bid, the, game, of, 4, with, good, club, support, and, overall, values, north, complies, as, north, is, at, the, higher, end, of, the, range, for, his, 2, bid, and, has, a, fourth, trump, the, 2, bid, promised, only, three, and, the, doubleton, queen, of, clubs, to, fit, with, partner, s, strength, there, north, could, instead, have, bid, 3, indicating, not, enough, strength, for, game, asking, south, to, pass, and, so, play, 3, in, the, auction, north, south, are, trying, to, investigate, whether, their, cards, are, sufficient, to, make, a, game, nine, tricks, at, notrump, ten, tricks, in, hearts, or, spades, 11, tricks, in, clubs, or, diamonds, which, yields, bonus, points, if, bid, and, made, east, west, are, competing, in, spades, hoping, to, play, a, contract, in, spades, at, a, low, level, 4, is, the, final, contract, 10, tricks, being, required, for, n, s, to, make, with, hearts, as, trump, south, is, the, declarer, having, been, first, to, bid, hearts, and, the, player, to, south, s, left, west, has, to, choose, the, first, card, in, the, play, known, as, the, opening, lead, west, chooses, the, spade, king, because, spades, is, the, suit, the, partnership, has, shown, strength, in, and, because, they, have, agreed, that, when, they, hold, two, touching, honors, or, adjacent, honors, they, will, play, the, higher, one, first, west, plays, the, card, face, down, to, give, their, partner, and, the, declarer, but, not, dummy, a, chance, to, ask, any, last, questions, about, the, bidding, or, to, object, if, they, believe, west, is, not, the, correct, hand, to, lead, after, that, north, s, cards, are, laid, on, the, table, and, north, becomes, dummy, as, both, the, north, and, south, hands, will, be, controlled, by, the, declarer, west, turns, the, lead, card, face, up, and, the, declarer, studies, the, two, hands, to, make, a, plan, for, the, play, on, this, hand, the, trump, ace, a, spade, and, a, diamond, trick, must, be, lost, so, declarer, must, not, lose, a, trick, in, clubs, if, the, k, is, held, by, west, south, will, find, it, very, hard, to, prevent, it, from, making, a, trick, unless, west, leads, a, club, there, is, an, almost, equal, chance, that, it, is, held, by, east, in, which, case, it, can, be, trapped, against, the, ace, and, will, be, beaten, using, a, tactic, known, as, a, finesse, after, considering, the, cards, the, declarer, directs, dummy, north, to, play, a, small, spade, east, plays, low, small, card, and, south, takes, the, a, gaining, the, lead, south, may, also, elect, to, duck, but, for, the, purpose, of, this, example, let, us, assume, south, wins, the, a, at, trick, 1, south, proceeds, by, drawing, trump, leading, the, k, west, decides, there, is, no, benefit, to, holding, back, and, so, wins, the, trick, with, the, ace, and, then, cashes, the, q, for, fear, of, conceding, a, ruff, and, discard, west, plays, the, 2, instead, of, another, spade, declarer, plays, low, from, the, table, and, east, scores, the, q, not, having, anything, better, to, do, east, returns, the, remaining, trump, taken, in, south, s, hand, the, trumps, now, accounted, for, south, can, now, execute, the, finesse, perhaps, trapping, the, king, as, planned, south, enters, the, dummy, i, e, wins, a, trick, in, the, dummy, s, hand, by, leading, a, low, diamond, using, dummy, s, a, to, win, the, trick, and, leads, the, q, from, dummy, to, the, next, trick, east, covers, the, queen, with, the, king, and, south, takes, the, trick, with, the, ace, and, proceeds, by, cashing, the, remaining, master, j, if, east, does, not, play, the, king, then, south, will, play, a, low, club, from, south, s, hand, and, the, queen, will, win, anyway, this, being, the, essence, of, the, finesse, the, game, is, now, safe, south, ruffs, a, small, club, with, a, dummy, s, trump, then, ruffs, a, diamond, in, hand, for, an, entry, back, and, ruffs, the, last, club, in, dummy, sometimes, described, as, a, crossruff, finally, south, claims, the, remaining, tricks, by, showing, his, or, her, hand, as, it, now, contains, only, high, trumps, and, there, s, no, need, to, play, the, hand, out, to, prove, they, are, all, winners, the, trick, by, trick, notation, used, above, can, be, also, expressed, in, tabular, form, but, a, textual, explanation, is, usually, preferred, in, practice, for, reader, s, convenience, plays, of, small, cards, or, discards, are, often, omitted, from, such, a, description, unless, they, were, important, for, the, outcome, north, south, score, the, required, 10, tricks, and, their, opponents, take, the, remaining, three, the, contract, is, fulfilled, and, north, enters, the, pair, numbers, the, contract, and, the, score, of, 420, for, the, winning, side, north, is, in, charge, of, bookkeeping, in, duplicate, tournaments, on, the, traveling, sheet, north, asks, east, to, check, the, score, entered, on, the, traveller, all, players, return, their, own, cards, to, the, board, and, the, next, deal, is, played, on, the, prior, hand, it, is, quite, possible, that, the, k, is, held, by, west, for, example, by, swapping, the, k, and, a, between, the, defending, hands, then, the, 4, contract, would, fail, by, one, trick, unless, west, had, led, a, club, early, in, the, play, the, failure, of, the, contract, would, not, mean, that, 4, was, a, bad, contract, on, this, hand, the, contract, depends, on, the, club, finesse, working, or, a, defense, error, the, bonus, points, awarded, for, making, a, game, contract, far, outweigh, the, penalty, for, going, one, off, so, it, is, best, strategy, in, the, long, run, to, bid, game, contracts, such, as, this, one, similarly, there, is, a, minuscule, chance, that, the, k, is, in, the, west, hand, but, the, west, hand, has, no, other, clubs, in, that, case, declarer, can, succeed, by, simply, cashing, the, a, felling, the, k, and, setting, up, the, q, as, a, winner, the, chance, of, this, is, far, lower, than, the, chance, that, east, started, with, the, k, therefore, the, superior, percentage, play, is, to, take, the, club, finesse, as, described, above, after, many, years, of, little, progress, computer, bridge, made, great, progress, at, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1996, the, acbl, initiated, the, official, world, championships, computer, bridge, to, be, held, annually, along, with, a, major, bridge, event, the, first, computer, bridge, championship, took, place, in, 1997, at, the, north, american,
