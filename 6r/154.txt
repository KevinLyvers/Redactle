abv, then, the, beverage, was, watered, down, yielding, a, simple, vodka, 30, 35, abv, or, a, stronger, one, if, the, watering, was, done, using, an, alembic, the, exact, production, methods, were, described, in, 1768, by, jan, pawe, biretowski, and, in, 1774, by, jan, chryzostom, pasek, the, late, 18th, century, inaugurated, the, production, of, vodka, from, various, unusual, substances, including, even, the, carrot, though, there, was, a, substantial, vodka, cottage, industry, in, poland, back, to, the, 16th, century, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, marked, the, start, of, real, industrial, production, of, vodka, in, poland, kresy, the, eastern, part, of, poland, was, controlled, by, the, russian, empire, at, that, time, vodkas, produced, by, the, nobility, and, clergy, became, a, mass, product, the, first, industrial, distillery, was, opened, in, 1782, in, lw, w, by, j, a, baczewski, he, was, soon, followed, by, jakub, haberfeld, who, in, 1804, established, a, factory, at, o, wi, cim, and, by, hartwig, kantorowicz, who, started, producing, wyborowa, in, 1823, at, pozna, the, implementation, of, new, technologies, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th,

the, 1980s, the, sale, of, vodka, was, rationed, following, the, success, of, the, solidarity, movement, and, the, abolition, of, single, party, rule, in, poland, many, distilleries, began, struggling, financially, some, filed, for, bankruptcy, but, many, were, privatized, leading, to, the, creation, of, various, new, brands, a, type, of, distilled, liquor, designated, by, the, russian, word, vodka, came, to, russia, in, the, late, 14th, century, in, 1386, the, genoese, ambassadors, brought, the, first, aqua, vitae, water, of, life, to, moscow, and, presented, it, to, dmitry, donskoy, the, grand, prince, the, liquid, obtained, by, distillation, of, grape, must, was, thought, to, be, a, concentrate, and, a, spirit, of, wine, spiritus, vini, in, latin, whence, came, to, the, name, of, this, substance, in, many, european, languages, like, english, spirit, or, russian, spirt, perhaps, one, of, the, earliest, terms, linked, to, vodka, production, was, varenoe, vino, distilled, wine, which, appears, in, a, 1399, document, another, term, used, was, perevara, a, precursor, to, vodka, which, last, appears, in, official, documents, in, 1495, the, term, korchma, is, one, of, the, oldest, official, terms, used, for, vodka, which, was, used, alongside, varenoe, vino, but, later, came, to, denote, illegally, produced, vodka, by, the, 16th, century, other, terms, that, referred, to, vodka, included, goriachee, vino, burning, wine, zhzhenoe, vino, burnt, wine, and, khlebnoe, vino, bread, wine, according, to, william, pokhlyobkin, in, around, 1430, a, monk, named, isidore, from, the, chudov, monastery, inside, the, moscow, kremlin, made, a, recipe, of, the, first, russian, vodka, having, a, special, knowledge, and, distillation, devices, he, became, the, creator, of, a, new, higher, quality, type, of, alcoholic, beverage, this, bread, wine, as, it, was, initially, known, was, for, a, long, time, produced, exclusively, in, the, moscow, grand, principality, and, in, no, other, russian, principality, this, situation, persisted, until, the, era, of, industrial, production, thus, this, beverage, was, closely, associated, with, moscow, in, 1474, ivan, iii, created, the, first, russian, state, monopoly, on, vodka, in, 1505, the, first, exports, of, distilled, russian, vodka, arrived, in, sweden, by, the, 16th, century, government, run, taverns, known, as, kabaks, replaced, privately, run, korchmas, giles, fletcher, who, was, the, english, ambassador, in, russia, wrote, in, every, great, towne, of, his, realme, he, hath, a, caback, or, drinking, house, where, is, sold, aquavit, which, they, call, russewine, mead, beere, c, out, of, these, hee, receiveth, rent, that, amounteth, to, a, great, summe, of, money, until, the, mid, 18th, century, the, drink, remained, relatively, low, in, alcohol, content, not, exceeding, 40, abv, multiple, terms, for, the, drink, were, recorded, sometimes, reflecting, different, levels, of, quality, alcohol, concentration, filtering, and, the, number, of, distillations, most, commonly, it, was, referred, to, as, burning, wine, bread, wine, or, even, in, some, locations, simply, wine, in, some, locations, grape, wine, may, have, been, so, expensive, that, it, was, a, drink, only, for, aristocrats, burning, wine, was, usually, diluted, with, water, to, 24, abv, or, less, before, drinking, it, was, mostly, sold, in, taverns, and, was, quite, expensive, at, the, same, time, the, word, vodka, was, already, in, use, but, it, described, herbal, tinctures, similar, to, nalewka, containing, up, to, 75, abv, and, made, for, medicinal, purposes, the, first, written, usage, of, the, word, vodka, in, an, official, russian, document, in, its, modern, meaning, is, dated, by, the, decree, of, empress, elizabeth, of, 8, june, 1751, which, regulated, the, ownership, of, vodka, distilleries, by, the, 1860s, a, government, policy, of, promoting, the, consumption, of, state, manufactured, vodka, made, it, the, drink, of, choice, for, many, russians, in, 1863, the, government, monopoly, on, vodka, production, was, repealed, causing, prices, to, plummet, and, making, vodka, available, even, to, low, income, citizens, the, taxes, on, vodka, became, a, key, element, of, government, finances, in, tsarist, russia, providing, at, times, up, to, 40, of, state, revenue, by, 1911, vodka, comprised, 89, of, all, alcohol, consumed, in, russia, this, level, has, fluctuated, somewhat, during, the, 20th, century, but, remained, quite, high, at, all, times, the, most, recent, estimates, put, it, at, 70, 2001, vodka, remains, a, major, source, of, state, revenue, and, therefore, of, power, seizing, control, of, the, state, spirits, monopoly, rosspirtprom, and, its, kristall, distillery, was, instrumental, for, vladimir, putin, to, consolidate, his, power, as, prime, minister, and, president, under, his, rule, the, putinka, little, putin, brand, of, vodka, became, a, bestseller, partly, to, putin, s, financial, benefit, other, popular, russian, vodka, producers, or, brands, include, stolichnaya, and, russian, standard, during, the, late, 1970s, russian, culinary, author, william, pokhlebkin, compiled, a, history, of, the, production, of, vodka, in, russia, as, part, of, the, soviet, case, in, a, trade, dispute, this, was, later, published, as, a, history, of, vodka, pokhlebkin, wrote, that, while, there, is, a, wealth, of, publications, about, the, history, of, consumption, and, distribution, of, vodka, virtually, nothing, had, been, written, about, vodka, production, one, of, his, assertions, was, that, the, word, vodka, was, used, in, popular, speech, in, russia, considerably, earlier, than, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, but, the, word, did, not, appear, in, print, until, the, 1860s, pokhlebkin, s, sources, were, challenged, by, david, christian, in, the, slavic, review, in, 1994, who, criticized, the, lack, of, valid, references, in, pokhlebkin, s, works, and, its, pro, russian, bias, pokhlebkin, is, also, known, for, his, pan, slavic, sympathies, under, the, leadership, of, russia, and, sentiments, that, in, david, christian, s, opinion, discredit, most, of, his, work, especially, his, history, of, vodka, up, until, the, 1950s, vodka, was, not, used, as, a, designation, for, swedish, distilled, beverages, which, were, instead, called, br, nnvin, burn, wine, the, word, having, the, same, etymology, as, the, dutch, brandewijn, which, is, the, base, for, the, word, brandy, this, beverage, has, been, produced, in, sweden, since, the, late, 15th, century, although, the, total, production, was, still, small, in, the, 17th, century, from, the, early, 18th, century, production, expanded, although, production, was, prohibited, several, times, during, grain, shortages, although, initially, a, grain, product, potatoes, started, to, be, used, in, production, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, became, dominant, from, the, early, 19th, century, from, the, early, 1870s, distillery, equipment, was, improved, progressively, from, the, 1960s, unflavoured, swedish, br, nnvin, also, came, to, be, called, vodka, the, first, swedish, product, to, use, this, term, was, explorer, vodka, which, was, created, in, 1958, and, initially, was, intended, for, the, american, export, market, although, it, ultimately, failed, to, do, so, it, remains, one, of, the, most, popular, vodka, brands, in, sweden, today, in, 1979, absolut, vodka, was, launched, reusing, the, name, of, the, old, absolut, rent, br, nnvin, absolutely, pure, br, nnvin, created, in, 1879, after, sweden, joined, the, european, union, in, 1995, the, regulations, were, changed, so, that, privately, owned, companies, could, produce, vodka, vodka, has, become, popular, among, young, people, with, a, flourishing, black, market, in, 2013, the, organizers, of, the, so, called, vodka, car, were, jailed, for, two, and, a, half, years, for, having, illegally, provided, thousands, of, liters, to, young, people, some, as, young, as, 13, vodka, may, be, distilled, from, any, starch, or, sugar, rich, plant, matter, most, vodka, today, is, produced, from, grains, such, as, sorghum, corn, rye, or, wheat, among, grain, vodkas, rye, and, wheat, vodkas, are, generally, considered, superior, some, vodkas, are, made, from, potatoes, molasses, soybeans, grapes, rice, sugar, beets, and, sometimes, even, byproducts, of, oil, refining, or, wood, pulp, processing, in, some, central, european, countries, such, as, poland, some, vodka, is, produced, by, just, fermenting, a, solution, of, crystal, sugar, and, yeast, in, the, european, union, there, are, talks, about, the, standardization, of, vodka, and, the, vodka, belt, countries, insist, that, only, spirits, produced, from, grains, potato, and, sugar, beet, molasses, be, allowed, to, be, branded, as, vodka, following, the, traditional, methods, of, production, in, the, united, states, many, vodkas, are, made, from, 95, pure, grain, alcohol, produced, in, large, quantities, by, agricultural, industrial, giants, archer, daniels, midland, grain, processing, corporation, and, midwest, grain, products, mgp, bottlers, purchase, the, base, spirits, in, bulk, then, filter, dilute, distribute, and, market, the, end, product, under, a, variety, of, vodka, brand, names, similar, methods, are, used, in, other, regions, such, as, europe, this, pure, grain, alcohol, also, known, as, rectified, spirit, neutral, spirit, or, ethyl, alcohol, of, agricultural, origin, is, also, available, directly, to, consumers, in, some, areas, as, products, such, as, everclear, polmos, spirytus, rektyfikowany, and, others, in, contrast, to, very, high, abv, vodkas, such, as, the, bulgarian, balkan, 176, with, 88, abv, these, grain, alcohol, products, are, not, considered, vodka, they, have, not, yet, gone, through, the, filtration, and, refining, process, used, to, produce, vodka, a, study, conducted, on, npr, s, planet, money, podcast, revealed, negligible, differences, in, taste, between, various, brands, of, vodka, leading, to, speculation, as, to, how, much, branding, contributes, to, the, concept, of, super, premium, vodkas, a, common, property, of, the, vodkas, produced, in, the, united, states, and, europe, is, the, extensive, use, of, filtration, before, any, additional, processing, including, the, addition, of, flavorants, filtering, is, sometimes, done, in, the, still, during, distillation, as, well, as, afterward, where, the, distilled, vodka, is, filtered, through, activated, charcoal, and, other, media, to, absorb, trace, amounts, of, substances, that, alter, or, impart, off, flavors, to, the, vodka, however, this, is, not, the, case, in, the, traditional, vodka, producing, nations, so, many, distillers, from, these, countries, prefer, to, use, very, accurate, distillation, but, minimal, filtering, thus, preserving, the, unique, flavors, and, characteristics, of, their, products, the, master, distiller, is, in, charge, of, distilling, the, vodka, and, directing, its, filtration, which, includes, the, removal, of, the, fore, shots, heads, and, tails, these, components, of, the, distillate, contain, flavor, compounds, such, as, ethyl, acetate, and, ethyl, lactate, heads, as, well, as, the, fusel, oils, tails, that, impact, the, usually, desired, clean, taste, of, vodka, through, numerous, rounds, of, distillation, or, the, use, of, a, fractioning, still, the, taste, is, modified, and, clarity, is, increased, in, contrast, the, distillery, process, for, liquors, such, as, whiskey, rum, and, baijiu, allow, portions, of, the, heads, and, tails, to, remain, giving, them, their, unique, flavors, repeated, distillation, of, vodka, will, make, its, ethanol, level, much, higher, than, is, acceptable, to, most, end, users, whether, legislation, determines, strength, limits, or, not, depending, on, the, distillation, method, and, the, technique, of, the, still, master, the, final, filtered, and, distilled, vodka, may, have, as, much, as, 95, 96, ethanol, as, such, most, vodka, is, diluted, with, water, before, bottling, while, most, vodkas, are, unflavored, many, flavored, vodkas, have, been, produced, in, traditional, vodka, drinking, areas, often, as, home, made, recipes, to, improve, vodka, s, taste, or, for, medicinal, purposes, flavorings, include, red, pepper, ginger, fruit, flavors, vanilla, chocolate, without, sweetener, and, cinnamon, in, russia, vodka, flavored, with, honey, and, pepper, pertsovka, in, russian, is, also, very, popular, in, poland, and, belarus, the, leaves, of, the, local, bison, grass, are, added, to, produce, ubr, wka, polish, and, zubrovka, belarusian, vodka, with, slightly, sweet, flavors, and, light, amber, colors, in, lithuania, and, poland, a, famous, vodka, containing, honey, is, called, krupnik, this, tradition, of, flavoring, is, also, prevalent, in, the, nordic, countries, where, vodka, seasoned, with, herbs, fruits, and, spices, is, the, appropriate, strong, drink, for, several, seasonal, festivities, sweden, has, forty, odd, common, varieties, of, herb, flavored, vodka, kryddat, br, nnvin, in, poland, and, ukraine, a, separate, category, nalyvka, in, ukraine, and, nalewka, in, poland, is, used, for, vodka, based, spirits, with, fruit, root, flower, or, herb, extracts, which, are, often, home, made, or, produced, by, small, commercial, distilleries, their, alcohol, contents, vary, between, 15, and, 75, in, estonia, vodkas, are, available, with, barberry, blackcurrant, cherry, green, apple, lemon, vanilla, and, watermelon, flavors, in, most, cases, vodka, flavoring, comes, from, a, post, distillation, infusion, of, flavors, through, the, fermentation, process, grain, mash, is, transformed, into, a, neutral, alcohol, beverage, that, is, unflavored, the, process, of, flavoring, vodka, so, that, it, tastes, like, fruits, chocolate, and, other, foods, occurs, after, fermentation, and, distillation, various, chemicals, that, reproduce, the, flavor, profiles, of, foods, are, added, into, vodka, to, give, it, a, specific, taste, vodka, is, less, likely, than, other, spirits, to, produce, the, undesirable, aftereffects, of, heavy, consumption, though, no, less, likely, to, intoxicate, because, of, its, low, level, of, fusel, oils, and, congeners, which, are, impurities, that, flavor, spirits, since, the, year, 2000, because, of, evolving, consumer, tastes, and, regulatory, changes, several, artisanal, vodka, or, even, ultra, premium, vodka, brands, have, appeared, the, success, of, grape, based, vodka, in, the, united, states, in, the, early, twenty, first, century, prompted, traditional, vodka, producers, in, the, vodka, belt, countries, of, poland, finland, estonia, lithuania, and, sweden, to, campaign, for, eu, legislation, that, would, define, vodka, as, only, spirits, made, from, grain, or, potatoes, this, proposition, provoked, heavy, criticism, from, south, european, countries, which, often, distill, used, mash, from, wine, making, into, spirits, although, higher, quality, mash, is, usually, distilled, into, some, variety, of, pomace, brandy, the, lower, quality, mash, is, better, turned, into, neutral, flavored, spirits, instead, any, vodka, not, made, from, either, grain, or, potatoes, would, have, to, display, the, products, used, in, its, production, this, regulation, entered, into, force, in, 2008, under, canadian, regulations, vodka, is, a, potable, alcoholic, distillate, obtained, from, potatoes, cereal, grain, or, any, other, material, of, agricultural, origin, fermented, by, the, action, of, yeast, or, a, mixture, of, yeast, and,
