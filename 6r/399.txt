scandinavia, and, the, netherlands, where, the, natives, added, bones, to, their, shoes, and, used, them, to, travel, on, frozen, rivers, canals, and, lakes, in, contrast, to, what, people, think, ice, skating, has, always, been, an, activity, of, joy, and, sports, and, not, a, matter, of, transport, and, travel, for, example, winters, in, the, netherlands, have, never, been, stable, and, cold, enough, to, make, ice, skating, a, regular, way, of, travelling, or, a, mode, of, transport, this, has, already, been, described, in, 1194, by, william, fitzstephen, who, described, a, sport, in, london, later, in, norway, king, eystein, magnusson, later, king, eystein, i, of, norway, boasts, of, his, skills, racing, on, bone, skates, so, called, ice, legs, however, skating, and, speed, skating, was, not, limited, to, the, netherlands, and, scandinavia, in, 1592, a, scotsman, designed, a, skate, with, an, iron, blade, it, was, iron, bladed, skates, that, led, to, the, spread, of, skating, and, in, particular, speed, skating, by, 1642, the, first, known, skating, club, the, skating, club, of, edinburgh, was, born, and, in, 1763, the, first, speed, skating, race, known, in, any, detail, was, held, from, wisbech, to, whittlesey, on, the, fens, in, england, for, a, prize, sum, of, 20, guineas, won, by, john, lamb, of, wisbech, while, in, the, netherlands, people, began, touring, the, waterways, connecting, the, 11, cities, of, friesland, a, challenge, which, eventually, led, to, the, elfstedentocht, the, first, known, speed, skating, competition, for, women, was, in, heerenveen, the, netherlands, from, 1, to, 2, february, 1805, the, competition, was, won, by, trijntje, pieters, westra, by, 1851, north, americans, had, discovered, a, love, of, the, sport, and, the, all, steel, blade, was, later, developed, there, in, norway, speed, skating, also, became, popular, as, there, was, a, huge, interest, in, the, 1885, speed, skating, race, at, frognerkilen, between, axel, paulsen, and, renke, van, der, zee, the, netherlands, came, back, to, the, fore, in, 1889, with, the, organization, of, the, first, world, championships, the, isu, international, skating, union, was, also, born, in, the, netherlands, in, 1892, by, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, skating, and, speed, skating, had, come, into, its, own, as, a, major, popular, sporting, activity, organized, races, on, ice, skates, developed, in, the, 19th, century, norwegian, clubs, hosted, competitions, from, 1863, with, races, in, christiania, drawing, five, digit, crowds, in, 1884, the, norwegian, axel, paulsen, was, named, amateur, champion, skater, of, the, world, after, winning, competitions, in, the, united, states, five, years, later, a, sports, club, in, amsterdam, held, an, ice, skating, event, they, called, a, world, championship, with, participants, from, russia, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, as, well, as, the, host, country, the, internationale, eislauf, vereinigung, now, known, as, the, international, skating, union, was, founded, at, a, meeting, of, 15, national, representatives, in, scheveningen, in, 1892, the, first, international, winter, sports, federation, the, nederlandse, schaatsrijderbond, was, founded, in, 1882, and, organised, the, world, championships, of, 1890, and, 1891, competitions, were, held, around, tracks, of, varying, lengths, the, 1885, match, between, axel, paulsen, and, remke, van, der, zee, was, skated, on, a, track, of, 6, 7, mile, 1400, metres, but, the, 400, metre, track, was, standardised, by, the, isu, in, 1892, along, with, the, standard, distances, for, world, championships, 500, m, 1500, m, 5000, m, and, 10, 000, m, skaters, started, in, pairs, each, to, their, own, lane, and, changed, lanes, for, every, lap, to, ensure, that, each, skater, completed, the, same, distance, this, is, what, is, now, known, as, long, track, speed, skating, competitions, were, exclusively, for, amateur, skaters, which, was, enforced, peter, sinnerud, was, disqualified, for, professionalism, in, 1904, and, lost, his, world, title, long, track, world, records, were, first, registered, in, imperial, distances, and, since, 1880, in, metrical, distances, the, latter, ones, improved, rapidly, since, their, adoption, as, standard, distances, by, the, isu, with, jaap, eden, lowering, the, world, 5000, metre, record, by, half, a, minute, during, the, hamar, european, championships, in, 1894, however, the, record, stood, for, 17, years, and, it, took, over, 50, years, to, lower, it, by, further, half, a, minute, the, elfstedentocht, was, organized, as, a, competition, in, 1909, and, has, been, held, at, irregular, intervals, whenever, the, ice, on, the, course, is, deemed, good, enough, other, outdoor, races, developed, later, with, friesland, in, the, northern, netherlands, hosting, a, race, in, 1917, but, the, dutch, natural, ice, conditions, have, rarely, been, conducive, to, skating, the, elfstedentocht, has, been, held, 15, times, in, the, nearly, 100, years, since, 1909, and, before, artificial, ice, was, available, in, 1962, national, championships, had, been, held, in, 25, of, the, years, between, 1887, when, the, first, championship, was, held, in, slikkerveer, and, 1961, since, artificial, ice, became, common, in, the, netherlands, dutch, speed, skaters, have, been, among, the, world, top, in, long, track, ice, skating, and, marathon, skating, another, solution, to, still, be, able, to, skate, marathons, on, natural, ice, became, the, alternative, elfstedentocht, the, alternative, elfstedentocht, races, take, part, in, other, countries, such, as, austria, finland, or, canada, and, all, top, marathon, skaters, as, well, as, thousands, of, recreative, skaters, travel, from, the, netherlands, to, the, location, where, the, race, is, held, according, to, the, nrc, handelsblad, journalist, jaap, bloembergen, the, country, takes, a, carnival, look, during, international, skating, championships, at, the, 1914, olympic, congress, the, delegates, agreed, to, include, ice, speed, skating, in, the, 1916, olympics, after, figure, skating, had, featured, in, the, 1908, olympics, however, world, war, i, put, an, end, to, the, plans, of, olympic, competition, and, it, was, not, until, the, winter, sports, week, in, chamonix, in, 1924, retroactively, awarded, olympic, status, that, ice, speed, skating, reached, the, olympic, programme, charles, jewtraw, from, lake, placid, new, york, won, the, first, olympic, gold, medal, though, several, norwegians, in, attendance, claimed, oskar, olsen, had, clocked, a, better, time, timing, issues, on, the, 500, were, a, problem, within, the, sport, until, electronic, clocks, arrived, in, the, 1960s, during, the, 1936, olympic, 500, metre, race, it, was, suggested, that, ivar, ballangrud, s, 500, metre, time, was, almost, a, second, too, good, finland, won, the, remaining, four, gold, medals, at, the, 1924, games, with, clas, thunberg, winning, 1, 500, metres, 5, 000, metres, and, allround, it, was, the, first, and, only, time, an, allround, olympic, gold, medal, has, been,

wars, with, latvians, and, austrians, visiting, the, podium, in, the, european, championships, however, north, american, races, were, usually, conducted, pack, style, similar, to, the, marathon, races, in, the, netherlands, but, the, olympic, races, were, to, be, held, over, the, four, isu, approved, distances, the, isu, approved, the, suggestion, that, the, speed, skating, at, the, 1932, winter, olympics, should, be, held, as, pack, style, races, and, americans, won, all, four, gold, medals, canada, won, five, medals, all, silver, and, bronze, while, defending, world, champion, clas,

all, four, distances, and, occupied, the, three, top, spots, in, the, allround, standings, norwegians, swedes, finns, and, japanese, skating, leaders, protested, to, the, usoc, condemning, the, manner, of, competition, and, expressing, the, wish, that, mass, start, races, were, never, to, be, held, again, at, the, olympics, however, the, isu, adopted, the, short, track, speed, skating, branch, with, mass, start, races, on, shorter, tracks, in, 1967, arranged, international, competitions, from, 1976, and, brought, them, back, to, the, olympics, in, 1992, artificial, ices, entered, the, long, track, competitions, with, the, 1960, winter, olympics, and, the, competitions, in, 1956, on, lake, misurina, were, the, last, olympic, competitions, on, natural, ice, 1960, also, saw, the, first, winter, olympic, competitions, for, women, lidia, skoblikova, won, two, gold, medals, in, 1960, and, four, in, 1964, more, aerodynamic, skating, suits, were, also, developed, with, swiss, skater, franz, krienb, hl, who, finished, 8th, on, the, olympic, 10, 000, m, at, the, age, of, 46, at, the, front, of, development, after, a, while, national, teams, took, over, development, of, bodysuits, which, are, also, used, in, short, track, skating, though, without, headcover, attached, to, the, suit, short, trackers, wear, helmets, instead, as, falls, are, more, common, in, mass, start, races, suits, and, indoor, skating, as, well, as, the, clap, skate, has, helped, to, lower, long, track, world, records, considerably, from, 1971, to, 2009, the, average, speed, on, the, men, s, 1500, metres, has, been, raised, from, 45, to, 52, km, h, similar, speed, increases, are, shown, in, the, other, distances, after, the, 1972, season, european, long, track, skaters, founded, a, professional, league, international, speedskating, league, which, included, ard, schenk, three, time, olympic, gold, medallist, in, 1972, as, well, as, five, norwegians, four, other, dutchmen, three, swedes, and, a, few, other, skaters, jonny, nilsson, 1963, world, champion, and, olympic, gold, medallist, was, the, driving, force, behind, the, league, which, folded, in, 1974, for, economic, reasons, and, the, isu, also, excluded, tracks, hosting, professional, races, from, future, international, championships, the, isu, later, organised, its, own, world, cup, circuit, with, monetary, prizes, and, full, time, professional, teams, developed, in, the, netherlands, during, the, 1990s, which, led, them, to, a, dominance, on, the, men, s, side, only, challenged, by, japanese, 500, m, racers, and, american, inline, skaters, who, changed, to, long, tracks, to, win, olympic, gold, during, the, 20th, century, roller, skating, also, developed, as, a, competitive, sport, roller, skating, races, were, professional, from, an, early, stage, professional, world, championships, were, arranged, in, north, america, between, the, competitors, on, that, circuit, later, roller, derby, leagues, appeared, a, professional, contact, sport, that, originally, was, a, form, of, racing, firs, world, championships, of, inline, speed, skating, go, back, to, the, 1980s, but, many, world, champions, such, as, derek, parra, and, chad, hedrick, have, switched, to, ice, in, order, to, win, olympic, medals, like, roller, skating, ice, speed, skating, was, also, professional, in, north, america, oscar, mathisen, five, time, isu, world, champion, and, three, time, european, champion, renounced, his, amateur, status, in, 1916, and, travelled, to, america, where, he, won, many, races, but, was, beaten, by, bobby, mclean, of, chicago, four, time, american, champion, in, one, of, the, races, chicago, was, a, centre, of, ice, speed, skating, in, america, the, chicago, tribune, sponsored, a, competition, called, the, silver, skates, from, 1912, to, 2014, in, 1992, short, track, speed, skating, was, accepted, as, an, olympic, sport, short, track, speed, skating, had, little, following, in, the, long, track, speed, skating, countries, of, europe, such, as, norway, the, netherlands, and, the, former, soviet, union, with, none, of, these, nations, having, won, official, medals, though, the, netherlands, won, two, gold, medals, when, the, sport, was, a, demonstration, event, in, 1988, the, norwegian, publication, sportsboken, spent, ten, pages, detailing, the, long, track, speed, skating, events, at, the, albertville, games, in, 1993, but, short, track, was, not, mentioned, by, word, though, the, results, pages, appeared, in, that, section, although, this, form, of, speed, skating, is, newer, it, is, growing, faster, than, long, track, speed, skating, largely, because, short, track, can, be, done, on, an, ice, hockey, rink, rather, than, a, long, track, oval, races, are, run, counter, clockwise, on, a, 111, meter, track, short, track, races, are, almost, always, run, in, a, mass, start, format, in, which, two, to, six, skaters, may, race, at, once, skaters, may, be, disqualified, for, false, starts, impeding, and, cutting, inside, the, track, false, starts, occur, when, a, skater, moves, before, the, gun, goes, off, at, the, start, of, a, race, skaters, are, disqualified, for, impeding, when, one, skater, cuts, in, front, of, another, skater, and, causes, the, first, skater, to, stand, up, to, avoid, collision, or, fall, cutting, inside, the, track, occurs, when, a, skater, s, skates, goes, inside, the, blocks, which, mark, the, track, on, the, ice, if, disqualified, the, skater, will, be, given, last, place, in, their, heat, or, final, races, are, run, counter, clockwise, on, a, 400, meter, oval, in, all, individual, competition, forms, only, two, skaters, are, allowed, to, race, at, once, skaters, must, change, lanes, every, lap, the, skater, changing, from, the, outside, lane, to, the, inside, has, right, of, way, skaters, may, be, disqualified, for, false, starts, impeding, and, cutting, inside, the, track, if, a, skater, misses, their, race, or, falls, they, have, the, option, to, race, their, distance, again, there, are, no, heats, or, finals, in, long, track, all, rankings, are, by, time, the, starting, procedure, in, long, track, speed, skating, consists, of, three, parts, first, the, referee, tells, the, athletes, to, go, to, the, start, second, the, referee, cues, the, athletes, to, get, ready, and, waits, until, the, skaters, have, stopped, moving, finally, the, referee, waits, for, a, random, duration, between, 1, and, 1, 5, seconds, and, then, fires, the, starting, shot, some, argue, that, this, inherent, timing, variability, could, disadvantage, athletes, that, start, after, longer, pauses, due, to, the, alerting, effect, in, the, only, non, individual, competition, form, the, team, pursuit, two, teams, of, each, three, to, four, skaters, are, allowed, to, race, at, once, both, teams, remain, in, the, inner, lane, for, the, duration, of, the, race, they, start, on, opposite, sides, of, the, rink, if, four, skaters, are, racing, one, skater, is, allowed, to, drop, off, and, stop, racing, the, clock, stops, when, the, third, skater, crosses, the, finish, line, the, team, pursuit, is, a, team, event, in, speed, skating, and, is, skated, by, teams, of, three, skaters, races, resemble, the, team, pursuit, event, in, track, cycling, two, teams, race, at, a, time, starting, at, a, line, in, the, middle, of, the, straightaway, one, team, starts, on, each, side, of, the, track, only, the, inner, lane, is, used, the, distance, is, eight, laps, for, men, and, six, for, women, the, team, s, time, is, the, third, skater, to, cross, the, finish, line, there, are, several, formats, for, the, team, pursuit, the, olympic, format, is, unusual, in, that, it, is, a, cup, format, with, several, rounds, of, exclusion, between, two, teams, in, the, world, cup, and, world, championships, one, race, is, skated, and, the, teams, are, ranked, by, their, finishing, time, in, the, olympic, format, a, team, that, overtakes, the, other, has, automatically, won, the, race, and, the, remaining, distance, is, not, skated, in, practice, the, distance, is, so, short, that, this, rarely, happens, unless, one, team, has, a, fall, the, team, pursuit, is, a, new, event, in, major, international, competitions, the, event, was, introduced, at, international, level, at, the, world, junior, championships, around, the, turn, of, the, millennium, and, to, the, world, cup, in, 2003, but, it, was, not, considered, an, official, isu, event, until, around, 2004, and, eventually, introduced, at, the, olympics, in, 2006, speed, skates, speed, skates, differ, greatly, from, hockey, skates, and, figure, skates, unlike, hockey, skates, and, figure, skates, speed, skates, cut, off, at, the, ankle, and, are, built, more, like, a, shoe, than, a, boot, to, allow, for, more, ankle, compression, the, blades, range, in, length, from, 30, to, 45, cm, depending, on, the, age, and, height, of, the, skater, short, track, blades, are, fixed, to, the, boot, in, at, the, heel, and, immediately, behind, the, ball, of, the, foot, long, track, skates, also, called, clap, skates, attach, to, a, hinge, at, the, front, of, the, boot, the, heel, of, the, boot, detaches, from, the, blade, on, every, stroke, through, a, spring, mechanism, located, at, the, front, connector, this, extends, the, skater, s, stroke, by, keeping, the, blade, on, the, ice, longer, speed, skates, are, manually, sharpened, using, a, jig, to, hold, them, in, place, short, track, all, short,

with, their, blades, long, track, skaters, skate, on, what, are, called, clap, blades, these, blades, have, hinges, under, the, boot, towards, the, back, it, is, described, in, more, detail, above, protective, eyewear, is, not, mandatory, the, suit, also, does, not, need, to, be, kevlar, long, track, skaters, wear, a, hood, that, is, built, into, the, suit
