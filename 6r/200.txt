a, cousin, is, a, relative, that, is, the, child, of, a, parent, s, sibling, this, is, more, specifically, referred, to, as, a, first, cousin, more, generally, in, the, kinship, system, used, in, the, english, speaking, world, a, cousin, is, a, type, of, relationship, in, which, relatives, are, two, or, more, generations, away, from, their, most, recent, common, ancestor, for, this, definition, degrees, and, removals, are, used, to, further, specify, the, relationship, degree, measures, how, distant, the, relationship, is, from, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, s, if, the, cousins, do, not, come, from, the, same, generation, removal, is, specified, as, removal, measures, the, difference, in, generations, between, the, two, cousins, when, the, removal, is, not, specified, no, removal, is, assumed, various, governmental, entities, have, established, systems, for, legal, use, that, can, precisely, specify, kinship, with, common, ancestors, any, number, of, generations, in, the, past, for, example, in, medicine, and, in, law, a, first, cousin, is, a, type, of, third, degree, relative, people, are, related, with, a, type, of, cousin, relationship, if, they, share, a, common, ancestor, and, are, separated, from, their, most, recent, common, ancestor, by, two, or, more, generations, this, means, neither, person, is, an, ancestor, of, the, other, they, do, not, share, a, parent, are, not, siblings, and, neither, is, a, sibling, of, the, other, s, parent, are, not, the, other, s, aunt, uncle, nor, niece, nephew, in, the, english, system, the, cousin, relationship, is, further, detailed, by, the, concepts, of, degree, and, removal, the, degree, is, the, number, of, generations, subsequent, to, the, common, ancestor, before, a, parent, of, one, of, the, cousins, is, found, this, means, the, degree, is, the, separation, of, the, cousin, from, the, common, ancestor, less, one, also, if, the, cousins, are, not, separated, from, the, common, ancestor, by, the, same, number, of, generations, the, cousin, with, the, smallest, separation, is, used, to, determine, the, degree, the, removal, is, the, difference, between, the, number, of, generations, from, each, cousin, to, the, common, ancestor, two, people, can, be, removed, but, be, around, the, same, age, due, to, differences, in, birth, dates, of, parents, children, and, other, relevant, ancestors, for, example, david, and, george, are, on, opposing, sides, of, the, family, tree, and, are, first, cousins, david, is, of, the, lowest, order, one, with, one, removal, the, cousins, are, of, order, one, and, two, respectively, therefore, the, difference, in, generations, to, the, common, ancestor, is, one, a, maternal, cousin, is, a, cousin, that, is, related, to, the, mother, s, side, of, the, family, while, a, paternal, cousin, is, a, cousin, that, is, related, to, the, father, s, side, of, the, family, this, relationship, is, not, necessarily, reciprocal, as, the, maternal, cousin, of, one, person, could, be, the, paternal, cousin, of, the, other, in, the, example, basic, family, tree, emma, is, david, s, maternal, cousin, and, david, is, emma, s, paternal, cousin, on, the, other, hand, parallel, and, cross, cousins, are, reciprocal, relationships, parallel, cousins, are, descended, from, same, sex, siblings, a, parallel, first, cousin, relationship, exists, when, both, the, subject, and, relative, are, maternal, cousins, or, both, are, paternal, cousins, cross, cousins, are, descendants, from, opposite, sex, siblings, a, cross, first, cousin, relationship, exists, when, the, subject, and, the, relative, are, maternal, cousin, and, paternal, cousin, to, each, other, in, the, basic, family, tree, example, david, and, emma, are, cross, cousins, double, cousins, are, relatives, who, are, cousins, from, two, different, branches, of, the, family, tree, this, occurs, when, siblings, respectively, reproduce, with, different, siblings, from, another, family, this, may, also, be, referred, to, as, cousins, on, both, sides, the, resulting, children, are, related, to, each, other, through, both, their, parents, and, are, thus, doubly, related, double, first, cousins, share, both, sets, of, grandparents, half, cousins, are, descended, from, half, siblings, and, would, share, one, grandparent, the, children, of, two, half, siblings, are, first, half, cousins, if, half, siblings, have, children, with, another, pair, of, half, siblings, the, resulting, children, would, be, double, half, first, cousins, while, there, is, no, agreed, upon, term, it, is, possible, for, cousins, to, share, three, grandparents, if, a, pair, of, half, siblings, had, children, with, a, pair, of, full, siblings, step, cousins, are, either, stepchildren, of, an, individual, s, aunt, or, uncle, nieces, and, nephews, of, one, s, step, parent, or, the, children, of, one, s, parent, s, step, sibling, a, cousin, in, law, is, the, cousin, of, one, s, spouse, or, the, spouse, of, one, s, cousin, consanguinity, is, a, measure, of, how, closely, individuals, are, related, to, each, other, it, is, measured, by, the, coefficient, of, relationship, below, when, discussing, the, coefficient, of, relationship, we, assume, the, subject, and, the, relative, are, related, only, through, the, kinship, term, a, coefficient, of, one, represents, the, relationship, one, has, with, oneself, consanguinity, decreases, by, half, for, every, generation, of, separation, from, the, most, recent, common, ancestor, as, there, are, two, parents, for, each, child, when, there, is, more, than, one, common, ancestor, the, consanguinity, between, each, ancestor, is, added, together, to, get, the, final, result, between, first, cousins, there, are, two, shared, ancestors, each, with, four, generations, of, separation, up, and, down, the, family, tree, 1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, displaystyle, left, tfrac, 1, 2, right, 4, left, tfrac, 1, 2, right, 4, their, consanguinity, is, one, eighth, for, each, additional, removal, of, the, cousin, relationship, consanguinity, is, reduced, by, half, as, the, generations, of, separation, increase, by, one, for, each, additional, degree, of, the, cousin, relationship, consanguinity, is, reduced, by, a, quarter, as, the, generations, of, separation, increase, by, one, on, both, sides, half, cousins, have, half, the, consanguinity, of, ordinary, cousins, as, they, have, half, the, common, ancestors, i, e, one, vs, two, double, cousins, have, twice, the, consanguinity, of, ordinary, cousins, as, they, have, twice, the, number, of, common, ancestors, i, e, four, vs, two, double, first, cousins, share, the, same, consanguinity, as, half, siblings, likewise, double, half, cousins, share, the, same, consanguinity, as, first, cousins, as, they, both, have, two, common, ancestors, if, there, are, half, siblings, on, one, side, and, full, siblings, on, the, other, they, would, have, three, halves, the, consanguinity, of, ordinary, first, cousins, in, a, scenario, where, two, monozygotic, identical, twins, have, children, with, another, pair, of, monozygotic, twins, the, resulting, double, cousins, would, test, as, genetically, similar, as, siblings, couples, that, are, closely, related, have, an, increased, chance, of, sharing, genes, including, mutations, that, occurred, in, their, family, tree, if, the, mutation, is, a, recessive, trait, it, will, not, reveal, itself, unless, both, father, and, mother, share, it, due, to, the, risk, that, the, trait, is, harmful, children, of, high, consanguinity, parents, have, an, increased, risk, of, recessive, genetic, disorders, see, inbreeding, for, more, information, closely, related, couples, have, more, children, couples, related, with, consanguinity, equivalent, to, that, of, third, cousins, have, the, greatest, reproductive, success, this, seems, counterintuitive, as, closely, related, parents, have, a, higher, probability, of, having, offspring, that, are, unfit, yet, closer, kinship, can, also, decrease, the, likelihood, of, immunological, incompatibility, during, pregnancy, cousin, marriage, is, important, in, several, anthropological, theories, which, often, differentiate, between, matriarchal, and, patriarchal, parallel, and, cross, cousins, currently, about, 10, and, historically, as, high, as, 80, of, all, marriages, are, between, first, or, second, cousins, cousin, marriages, are, often, arranged, anthropologists, believe, it, is, used, as, a, tool, to, strengthen, the, family, conserve, its, wealth, protect, its, cultural, heritage, and, retain, the, power, structure, of, the, family, and, its, place, in, the, community, some, groups, encourage, cousin, marriage, while, others, attach, a, strong, social, stigma, to, it, in, some, regions, in, the, middle, east, more, than, half, of, all, marriages, are, between, first, or, second, cousins, in, some, of, the, countries, in, this, region, this, may, exceed, 70, just, outside, this, region, it, is, often, legal, but, infrequent, many, cultures, have, encouraged, specifically, cross, cousin, marriages, in, other, places, it, is, legally, prohibited, and, culturally, equivalent, to, incest, supporters, of, cousin, marriage, often, view, the, prohibition, as, discrimination, while, opponents, claim, potential, immorality
