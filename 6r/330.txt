of, the, tiles, of, the, most, commonly, available, sets, includes, no, exotic, complex, rules, and, has, a, relatively, small, set, of, scoring, sets, hands, with, a, simple, scoring, system, for, these, reasons, hong, kong, mahjong, is, a, suitable, variation, for, the, introduction, of, game, rules, and, play, and, is, the, focus, of, this, article, old, hong, kong, mahjong, is, played, with, a, standard, set, of, 144, mahjong, tiles, though, cards, may, be, used, sets, often, include, counters, to, keep, score, dice, to, decide, how, to, deal, and, a, marker, to, show, who, the, dealer, is, and, which, round, is, being, played, some, sets, include, racks, to, hold, the, tiles, especially, if, they, are, larger, or, smaller, than, standard, tiles, or, have, an, odd, shape, mahjong, sets, originating, from, the, united, states, japan, or, southeast, asia, will, likely, have, extra, tiles, or, specialized, markings, the, tiles, are, split, into, three, categories, suited, honors, and, bonus, tiles, suited, tiles, are, divided, into, three, suits, and, each, are, numbered, from, 1, to, 9, the, suits, are, bamboos, dots, and, characters, there, are, four, identical, copies, of, each, suited, tile, totaling, 108, tiles, the, bamboo, suit, is, also, known, as, sticks, strings, or, bams, suit, the, first, tile, usually, has, a, bird, traditionally, a, peacock, or, sparrow, instead, of, a, single, bamboo, the, dots, suit, is, also, known, as, the, wheels, circles, coins, stones, marbles, or, balls, suit, the, characters, suit, is, also, known, as, the, myriads, cracks, or, numbers, suit, since, the, top, characters, are, numbers, in, the, chinese, orthography, and, the, bottom, characters, in, traditional, chinese, characters, are, the, chinese, orthography, of, ten, thousand, there, are, two, different, sets, of, honors, tiles, winds, and, dragons, the, winds, are, east, south, west, and, north, beginning, with, east, the, dragons, are, red, green, and, white, the, white, dragon, has, a, blue, or, black, frame, on, the, face, of, the, piece, or, in, some, sets, is, entirely, blank, these, tiles, have, no, numerical, sequence, like, the, suited, tiles, for, example, the, bamboo, pieces, number, 1, to, 9, like, the, suited, tiles, there, are, four, identical, copies, of, each, honors, tile, for, a, total, of, 28, honors, tiles, there, are, two, sets, of, bonus, tiles, flowers, and, seasons, the, flower, and, season, tiles, play, a, unique, role, in, the, mechanics, of, the, game, when, drawn, the, bonus, tile, is, not, added, into, a, player, s, hand, but, are, instead, set, aside, and, kept, near, the, player, s, other, tiles, for, scoring, purposes, should, they, win, the, hand, and, an, extra, tile, is, drawn, in, replacement, of, the, bonus, tile, in, addition, unlike, the, suited, and, honors, tiles, there, is, only, one, of, each, bonus, tile, so, there, are, a, total, of, four, flower, and, four, season, tiles, in, the, set, the, tiles, have, a, different, artistic, rendering, of, a, specific, type, of, flower, or, season, it, is, not, necessary, to, know, the, names, or, the, chinese, characters, of, each, bonus, tile, only, the, number, as, this, is, associated, with, a, specific, direction, and, the, player, receives, bonus, points, when, the, bonus, tile, matches, the, seat, direction, there, is, no, relation, between, the, bonus, tile, bamboo, flower, and, the, bamboo, suit, of, suited, tiles, e, g, 4, bamboo, in, traditional, chinese, culture, the, four, gentlemen, are, the, plum, winter, orchid, spring, bamboo, summer, and, chrysanthemum, autumn, which, are, regarded, as, the, representative, plants, of, those, seasons, but, people, regard, it, as, plum, blossom, spring, orchid, summer, chrysanthemum, autumn, and, bamboo, winter, now, the, dealer, is, chosen, by, various, means, for, example, each, player, throws, dice, with, the, highest, count, taking, the, dealer, position, second, highest, taking, south, etc, or, one, player, may, place, one, tile, of, each, wind, face, down, and, shuffle, them, each, player, randomly, select, one, of, these, tiles, and, these, tiles, dictate, their, wind, position, each, player, sits, down, at, their, respective, position, called, the, wind, position, at, the, table, in, positions, of, an, inverted, compass, east, is, dealer, the, right, of, the, dealer, is, south, across, is, west, and, the, left, is, north, the, order, of, play, is, traditionally, counter, clockwise, a, match, consists, of, four, rounds, each, representing, a, prevailing, wind, starting, with, east, once, the, first, round, is, completed, a, second, round, begins, with, south, as, the, prevailing, wind, and, so, on, wind, position, is, significant, in, that, it, affects, the, scoring, of, the, game, a, mahjong, set, with, winds, in, play, will, usually, include, a, separate, prevailing, wind, marker, typically, a, die, marked, with, the, wind, characters, in, a, holder, in, each, round, at, least, four, hands, are, played, with, each, player, taking, the, position, of, dealer, in, the, first, hand, of, each, round, player, 1, winner, of, the, dice, toss, is, east, and, therefore, dealer, in, the, second, hand, player, 2, takes, the, east, position, shifting, the, seat, winds, amongst, the, players, counter, clockwise, though, players, do, not, physically, move, their, chairs, this, continues, until, all, four, players, have, been, east, dealer, a, marker, is, used, to, mark, which, player, is, east, and, often, the, round, number, in, sets, with, racks, a, rack, may, be, marked, differently, to, denote, the, dealer, whenever, a, player, in, the, east, position, dealer, wins, a, hand, or, if, there, is, no, winner, a, draw, or, goulash, hand, an, extra, hand, is, played, with, the, same, seating, positions, and, prevailing, wind, as, in, the, previous, hand, this, means, that, a, match, may, potentially, have, no, limit, to, the, number, of, hands, played, though, some, players, will, set, a, limit, of, three, consecutive, hands, allowed, with, the, same, seat, positions, and, prevailing, wind, example, of, games, all, tiles, are, placed, face, down, on, the, table, and, are, shuffled, by, convention, all, players, should, participate, in, shuffling, using, both, hands, moving, the, pieces, around, the, table, rigorously, and, loudly, for, a, lengthy, period, tiles, may, get, flipped, up, during, this, process, and, players, should, flip, them, facing, down, as, soon, as, possible, to, avoid, identifying, the, location, of, the, revealed, tiles, each, player, then, stacks, a, row, of, 18, tiles, two, tiles, high, in, front, of, them, for, a, total, of, 36, tiles, players, then, push, each, side, of, their, stack, together, to, form, a, square, wall, regular, players, usually, place, their, stacks, in, a, slightly, diagonal, position, about, 20, to, 30, degrees, counter, clockwise, the, right, end, of, their, stack, is, pushed, slightly, further, in, to, the, centre, of, the, table, to, meet, almost, the, middle, of, the, stack, of, the, player, on, the, right, this, creates, a, smaller, square, wall, the, length, of, about, half, of, each, stack, with, walls, extended, away, from, each, corner, of, the, square, the, diagonally, positioned, stacks, and, a, smaller, square, creates, a, bigger, space, for, players, tiles, and, also, makes, an, ergonomic, position, for, drawing, tiles, from, the, stack, the, dealer, throws, three, dice, in, the, square, wall, and, sums, up, the, total, counting, counter, clockwise, so, that, the, dealer, is, 1, or, 5, 9, 13, 17, so, that, south, player, to, the, right, is, 2, or, 6, 10, 14, 18, etc, a, player, s, quarter, of, the, wall, is, chosen, some, house, rules, may, use, only, two, dice, but, have, double, throws, to, increase, randomness, in, the, case, of, double, throws, the, player, of, the, chosen, wall, makes, the, second, throw, using, the, same, total, on, the, dice, or, the, total, of, the, two, throws, the, player, whose, wall, is, chosen, then, counts, the, stacks, of, tiles, from, right, to, left, for, double, throws, the, count, may, extend, to, the, left, side, player, s, stack, this, determines, the, location, where, the, deck, of, tiles, is, cut, starting, from, the, left, of, the, stacks, counted, the, dealer, draws, four, tiles, for, their, hand, proceeding, in, counter, clockwise, order, players, take, turns, drawing, blocks, of, four, tiles, so, that, the, stacks, decrease, clockwise, until, each, player, including, the, dealer, has, 12, tiles, each, player, then, draws, one, last, tile, to, make, a, 13, tile, hand, the, tile, to, be, drawn, is, always, the, topmost, tile, left, of, the, cut, dealing, does, not, have, to, be, strictly, this, way, and, may, be, done, quite, differently, based, on, house, rules, tiles, may, flip, over, when, being, dealt, and, players, should, agree, in, advance, on, how, to, deal, with, the, problem, solutions, include, having, the, dealer, penalised, points, shuffling, the, turned, over, piece, back, into, the, wall, somehow, allowing, the, player, to, whom, the, tiles, were, dealt, to, take, the, piece, or, not, meaning, the, dealer, must, take, it, as, their, 14th, piece, or, other, house, rules, each, player, now, sets, aside, any, flowers, or, seasons, they, may, have, drawn, and, takes, turns, to, draw, replacement, tiles, from, the, wall, in, the, counter, clockwise, direction, from, the, dealer, if, a, player, gets, any, flowers, or, seasons, tiles, in, the, replacement, draw, the, players, must, wait, for, the, next, turn, to, draw, replacement, tiles, the, dealer, draws, a, piece, from, the, wall, in, clockwise, direction, adding, it, to, their, hand, typically, this, draw, is, performed, during, the, initial, deal, to, speed, up, play, if, this, does, not, complete, a, legal, hand, the, dealer, then, discards, a, piece, throwing, it, into, the, middle, of, the, wall, with, no, particular, order, in, mind, each, player, in, turn, in, counter, clockwise, direction, draws, a, tile, from, the, wall, as, long, as, the, tile, drawn, is, not, one, of, the, bonus, tiles, the, player, proceeds, to, discard, a, tile, either, the, tile, just, drawn, or, a, tile, in, the, hand, to, maintain, a, hand, of, 13, the, discarded, tile, is, thrown, into, the, centre, and, if, desired, the, player, announces, out, loud, what, the, piece, is, the, other, players, have, an, opportunity, to, seize, the, discarded, tile, if, no, one, takes, it, the, turn, continues, to, the, next, player, play, continues, this, way, until, one, player, has, a, legal, winning, hand, and, calls, out, the, win, each, region, does, this, call, differently, no, asian, version, uses, the, word, mahjong, to, signal, a, win, while, revealing, their, hand, there, are, four, different, ways, that, regular, order, of, play, can, be, interrupted, during, play, each, player, s, hand, should, always, be, 13, tiles, meaning, in, each, turn, a, tile, must, be, picked, up, and, another, discarded, the, count, of, 13, tiles, do, not, include, any, bonus, tiles, flowers, and, seasons, which, are, set, to, the, side, nor, does, it, include, the, fourth, added, piece, of, a, kong, if, a, player, is, seen, to, have, fewer, or, more, than, 13, tiles, in, their, hand, outside, of, their, turn, they, are, penalised, a, winning, hand, consists, of, 14, tiles, since, players, always, have, 13, tiles, in, their, hand, during, play, they, must, win, by, either, drawing, a, piece, from, the, wall, that, completes, a, 14, tile, hand, winning, from, the, wall, or, claiming, a, discard, from, another, player, which, completes, a, 14, tile, hand, winning, by, discard, the, winning, hand, is, made, of, four, melds, a, specific, pattern, of, three, pieces, and, the, eyes, a, pair, of, identical, pieces, the, exceptions, to, this, rule, are, the, special, hands, listed, below, most, players, play, with, a, table, minimum, meaning, a, winning, hand, must, score, a, minimum, number, of, points, which, can, be, seen, in, the, scoring, section, in, hong, kong, mahjong, the, most, common, point, set, is, three, but, can, be, higher, or, lower, depending, on, house, rules, melds, are, groups, of, tiles, within, the, player, s, hand, consisting, of, either, a, pong, three, identical, tiles, a, kong, four, identical, tiles, a, chow, three, suited, tiles, all, of, the, same, suit, in, numerical, sequence, or, eyes, two, identical, tiles, needed, in, a, winning, hand, melds, may, be, formed, by, drawing, a, tile, from, the, wall, or, by, seizing, another, player, s, discard, there, are, rules, governing, which, player, has, priority, for, a, discard, and, whether, the, meld, should, be, exposed, displayed, to, all, players, or, remain, concealed, depending, on, the, manner, in, which, the, meld, is, formed, consider, a, kong, the, same, as, a, pong, with, an, additional, tile, to, make, a, complete, set, of, four, there, are, three, ways, to, form, a, kong, the, meld, must, be, in, absolute, numerical, sequence, and, all, in, the, same, suit, players, cannot, skip, numbers, or, meld, from, the, 8, or, 9, to, 1, or, 2, honors, tiles, cannot, be, used, to, make, chows, because, they, have, no, numerical, value, and, bonus, tiles, flowers, and, seasons, also, cannot, be, used, to, make, a, chow, the, regular, counter, clockwise, order, of, turns, may, be, interrupted, for, four, events, whenever, a, player, draws, a, flower, or, season, it, is, announced, and, then, placed, to, the, side, it, is, not, considered, a, part, of, the, 13, tile, hand, but, in, the, event, that, player, wins, they, may, earn, bonus, points, for, them, and, the, last, tile, of, the, wall, is, drawn, as, a, replacement, tile, so, that, the, player, has, the, 14, pieces, needed, before, their, discard, this, may, happen, successively, in, a, player, s, turn, when, a, player, discards, a, tile, other, players, may, steal, the, tile, to, complete, a, meld, stealing, tiles, has, both, advantages, quickly, forming, a, winning, hand, and, scoring, extra, points, and, disadvantages, being, forced, to, reveal, part, of, one, s, hand, to, other, players, and, not, being, able, to, change, the, meld, once, declared, when, a, meld, pong, kong, or, chow, is, declared, through, a, discard, the, player, must, state, the, type, of, meld, to, be, declared, and, expose, the, meld, by, placing, the, three, or, four, tiles, face, up, the, player, must, then, discard, a, tile, and, play, continues, to, the, right, if, the, player, who, melds, a, discard, is, not, directly, after, the, discarder, in, order, of, play, one, or, two, players, will, essentially, miss, their, turn, as, play, continues, counter, clockwise, from, the, player, who, declared, the, meld, if, multiple, players, call, for, a, discarded, tile, priority, for, the, discard, depends, on, the, declared, action, of, the, player, stealing, the, discard, the, act, of, winning, a, hand, interrupts, play, to, assess, the, validity, of, the, hand, won, upon, confirmation, the, player, is, awarded, the, hand, s, value, per, the, specific, game, s, rule, if, at, any, point, in, the, game, a, player, can, use, another, player, s, discard, to, complete, a, legal, hand, and, with, the, agreed, minimum, points, they, declare, a, win, and, reveal, their, winning, hand, this, ends, the, hand, and, scoring, commences, if, more, than, one, player, can, use, a, discard, to, win, the, hand, multiple, ways, can, handle, the, situation, based, on, agreed, table, rules, the, players, might, count, the, points, they, would, win, with, the, discard, and, the, winner, is, the, one, with, the, higher, score, the, winner, might, simply, be, the, player, closest, to, the, discarder, in, order, of, turn, or, multiple, players, may, be, granted, the, win, simultaneously, alternatively, a, player, may, also, win, by, drawing, a, tile, that, completes, a, legal, hand, this, is, called, winning, from, the, wall, in, hong, kong, mahjong, winning, from, the, wall, doubles, the, number, of, base, points, each, loser, must, pay, technically, the, declaration, for, winning, a, hand, may, be, done, at, any, time, however, the, player, must, have, a, complete, and, legal, hand, otherwise, the, player, is, penalized, the, penalty, depends, on, table, rules, the, player, may, forfeit, points, to, the, other, players, another, potential, penalty, is, the, player, who, called, out, the, false, win, must, play, the, rest, of, the, hand, with, their, tiles, face, up, on, the, table, so, other, players, can, see, them, open, hand, some, methods, apply, the, penalty, at, the, end, of, the, entire, game, again, the, table, rules, dictate, the, enforcement, of, the, penalty, a, rarely, occurring, and, high, scoring, feature, of, hong, kong, mahjong, is, a, move, called, robbing, the, kong, if, a, player, declares, a, kong, by, adding, a, fourth, piece, to, a, melded, pong, but, another, player, can, use, that, piece, to, complete, a, hand, the, completing, player, takes, priority, to, win, the, hand, and, may, steal, that, piece, from, the, player, who, intended, to, declare, the, kong, below, are, two, examples, of, winning, hands, a, winning, hand, must, consist, of, four, melds, pongs, kongs, or, chows, and, a, pair, eyes, and, must, also, score, the, agreed, table, minimum, most, players, include, table, variations, in, their, games, of, which, some, non, standard, are, included, the, hands, of, seven, different, pairs, and, 13, orphans, are, examples, which, do, not, have, four, melds, and, the, eyes, they, are, described, in, more, detail, below, if, the, dealer, wins, the, hand, they, will, remain, the, dealer, and, an, extra, hand, is, played, in, addition, to, the, minimum, 16, hands, in, a, match, an, extra, hand, is, also, played, if, there, is, no, winner, by, the, time, all, the, tiles, in, the, wall, have, been, drawn, when, there, is, no, winner, it, is, known, as, a, goulash, hand, depending, on, table, rules, the, winner, of, the, next, game, may, take, an, agreed, number, of, points, from, each, player, carrying, over, the, points, from, the, non, winning, hand, to, the, winning, one, if, there, are, two, or, three, goulash, hands, in, a, row, then, the, winner, would, collect, a, considerable, number, of, points, from, each, player, on, top, of, their, scoring, hand, because, extra, hands, may, be, played, every, time, a, dealer, wins, or, if, there, is, a, goulash, hand, a, match, of, 16, hands, can, easily, become, a, match, of, 20, or, even, much, more, as, table, rules, add, a, large, amount, of, flexibility, for, players, they, can, choose, to, disregard, the, rule, of, extra, hands, and, pass, on, the, dealership, regardless, of, who, wins, or, if, it, results, in, a, goulash, hand, this, puts, a, maximum, estimated, limit, on, the, game, duration, and, provides, some, amount, of, predictability, players, may, agree, on, table, rules, if, the, pace, of, the, game, is, brisk, or, leisurely, for, brisk, games, players, may, agree, that, a, couple, seconds, after, a, discard, are, allowed, for, a, window, of, opportunity, before, the, next, player, picks, up, from, the, wall, usually, it, is, agreed, once, the, next, player, has, waited, the, duration, of, the, window, of, opportunity, and, draws, a, tile, from, the, wall, the, previous, discard, is, lost, and, cannot, be, claimed, old, hong, kong, scoring, is, relatively, simple, there, is, only, one, winner, or, if, there, is, a, draw, the, hand, is, replayed, the, winner, must, have, a, legal, hand, that, meets, the, minimum, faan, points, agreed, to, in, advance, not, including, any, bonus, points, only, the, winner, scores, and, the, other, players, pay, the, winner, various, sums, after, each, hand, ends, the, winner, counts, their, faan, points, a, concealed, meld, is, one, that, contains, no, tiles, stolen, from, another, player, s, discard, a, concealed, hand, is, one, made, up, of, only, concealed, melds, many, variations, distinguish, between, a, concealed, hand, winning, from, the, wall, and, a, semi, concealed, hand, the, last, tile, is, a, stolen, discard, in, most, mahjong, variations, having, a, concealed, hand, can, be, valuable, in, scoring, hong, kong, mahjong, does, not, award, concealed, melds, hands, as, generously, as, others, concealed, hands, only, the, case, with, a, few, limit, hands, or, half, limit, hands, thirteen, orphans, heavenly, gates, four, concealed, pongs, as, well, as, a, complete, hand, seven, pairs, and, over, several, melds, three, concealed, pongs, a, winning, hand, must, include, an, agreed, minimum, amount, of, faan, value, often, 3, some, examples, of, scoring, include, a, player, only, scores, a, bonus, faan, for, flowers, or, seasons, if, it, is, their, own, flower, or, season, east, 1, south, 2, west, 3, and, north, 4, or, if, the, player, has, all, four, flowers, or, all, four, seasons, scoring, 5, faan, in, total, the, losers, pay, the, winning, player, points, based, on, several, criteria, and, depending, on, whether, the,

faan, value, of, a, hand, is, converted, into, base, points, which, are, then, used, to, calculate, the, points, the, losers, pay, the, winner, the, table, is, progressive, doubling, the, number, of, base, points, when, reaching, a, certain, faan, point, target, the, following, is, the, old, hong, kong, simplified, table, for, other, tables, see, hong, kong, mahjong, scoring, rules, this, table, is, based, on, play, where, 3, faan, is, the, minimum, needed, in, order, to, win, with, a, legal, hand, if, a, player, has, 3, faan, then, their, hand, is, worth, one, base, point, a, winning, hand, with, 9, faan, is, worth, four, base, points, losing, players, must, give, the, winning, player, the, value, of, these, base, points, the, following, special, cases, result, in, doubled, base, points, if, two, of, these, criteria, apply, to, any, player, they, must, double, and, then, redouble, the, points, owed, to, the, winner, hong, kong, mahjong, is, essentially, a, payment, system, of, doubling, and, redoubling, where, winning, from, the, wall, adds, great, value, to, the, final, payment, and, where, the, dealer, is, highly, rewarded, or, penalised, if, they, win, or, lose, in, hong, kong, mahjong, there, are, a, series, of, limit, hands, these, are, exceptional, hands, difficult, to, obtain, and, are, very, valuable, in, point, scoring, as, many, table, rules, put, a, limit, on, the, number, of, points, a, winner, s, hand, can, score, full, limit, hands, score, that, maximum, table, rules, dictate, if, these, rare, and, special, hands, are, allowed, which, ones, and, the, limit, for, scoring, a, common, scoring, limit, is, 64, points, which, is, the, highest, base, points, doubled, twice, a, winner, receives, the, scoring, limit, from, each, player, without, any, doubling, some, limit, hands, by, necessity, must, be, completely, concealed, not, discards, used, or, semi, concealed, the, only, discard, used, is, the, one, needed, to, win, this, includes, the, 13, orphans, 4, concealed, pongs, heavenly, hand, and, earthly, hand, it, is, usually, expected, that, the, heavenly, gates, hand, be, concealed, or, semi, concealed, as, for, the, dragon, limit, hands, and, the, great, winds, table, rules, dictate, whether, the, hand, must, be, concealed, or, not, some, table, rules, claim, that, a, semi, concealed, hand, winning, from, a, discard, scores, a, half, limit, some, groups, also, play, with, the, great, flowers, rule, if, a, player, picks, up, all, four, flowers, and, all, four, seasons, during, their, hand, they, instantly, win, the, hand, and, receive, the, maximum, points, from, all, of, the, players, this, is, exceptionally, rare, in, all, the, hands, that, require, pongs, each, pong, can, be, replaced, by, the, corresponding, kong, variations, may, have, far, more, complicated, scoring, systems, add, or, remove, tiles, and, include, far, more, scoring, elements, and, limit, hands, in, many, places, players, often, observe, one, version, and, are, either, unaware, of, other, variations, or, claim, that, different, versions, are, incorrect, in, mainland, china, alone, there, are, over, thirty, variants, many, variations, today, differ, only, by, scoring, mahjong, playing, surfaces, are, typically, square, and, small, enough, to, be, within, arm, s, length, of, all, equipment, the, edges, are, raised, to, prevent, tiles, from, sliding, off, and, the, surface, is, covered, in, felt, to, limit, wear, on, the, tiles, automatic, dealing, tables, often, used, for, high, stakes, playing, and, tournaments, are, able, to, shuffle, tiles, build, walls, and, randomize, dice, it, is, an, elaborate, device, built, into, a, table, which, uses, two, alternating, sets, of, tiles, it, shuffles, one, set, of, tiles, while, the, players, play, on, the, other, set, after, the, round, is, finished, the, tiles, are, dropped, into, the, table, and, the, standby, wall, raises, upwards, the, following, chart, shows, the, most,

honors, korean, mahjong, removes, the, bamboo, suit, or, at, least, its, numbers, 2, 8, so, that, terminals, can, be, used, japanese, mahjong, rarely, uses, flowers, or, seasons, the, seasons, are, removed, in, korean, mahjong, while, many, southeast, asian, sets, have, more, flower, series, some, mahjong, variants, accept, wildcard, tiles, the, wildcard, tiles, are, decided, at, the, beginning, of, the, game, by, choosing, one, random, tile, the, wild, card, could, be, the, immediately, following, tile, on, the, wall, after, distributing, tiles, to, all, players, or, it, could, also, be, separately, decided, by, a, dice, throw, wildcard, tiles, cannot, be, discarded, and, can, only, replace, tiles, in, chows, wildcard, tiles, cannot, replace, tiles, in, pongs, and, kongs, for, example, if, a, character, 4, is, chosen, then, character, 4, and, the, next, sequential, tile, character, 5, can, be, used, as, wild, cards, in, this, round, when, the, wildcard, indicator, is, chosen, and, exposed, only, 3, tiles, remain, of, the, same, denomination, so, the, next, tile, in, the, suit, will, also, be, used, as, a, wildcard, adding, to, 7, wildcard, tiles, for, 4, players, also, if, a, tile, numbered, 9, is, the, indicator, the, suits, circle, back, to, 1, after, 9, thus, the, number, 9, and, 1, are, wild, cards, also, if, the, chosen, tile, is, not, in, the, suited,

any, player, with, the, tile, it, represents, rules, governing, discarding, joker, tiles, also, exist, some, variations, permit, the, joker, tile, to, take, on, the, identity, of, any, tile, and, others, only, permit, the, joker, tile, to, take, on, the, identity, of, the, previously, discarded, tile, or, the, absence, of, a, tile, if, it, is, the, first, discard, joker, tiles, may, or, may, not, affect, scoring, depending, on, the, variation, some, special, hands, may, require, the, use, of, joker, tiles, for, example, to, represent, a, fifth, tile, of, a, certain, suited, or, honor,

been, borrowed, from, card, games, such, as, hearts, many, variations, have, specific, hands, some, of, which, are, common, while, some, are, optional, depending, on, regions, and, players, one, example, is, the, pure, green, hand, made, of, chows, or, pongs, using, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, of, bamboo, and, green, dragon, when, a, hand, is, one, tile, short, of, winning, for, example, waiting, for, or, as, can, be, the, eyes, the, hand, is, said, to, be, a, ready, hand, or, more, figuratively, on, the, pot, the, player, holding, a, ready, hand, is, said, to, be, waiting, for, certain, tiles, it, is, common, to, be, waiting, for, two, or, three, tiles, and, some, variations, award, points, for, a, hand, that, is, waiting, for, one, tile, in, 13, tile, mahjong, the, largest, number, of, tiles, for, which, a, player, can, wait, is, 13, the, thirteen, wonders, or, 13, orphans, a, nonstandard, special, hand, ready, hands, must, be, declared, in, some, variations, of, mahjong, while, other, variations, prohibit, the, same, some, variations, of, mahjong, most, notably, japanese, and, korean, ones, allow, a, player, to, declare, r, chi, sometimes, known, as, reach, as, it, is, phonetically, similar, a, declaration, of, r, chi, is, a, promise, that, any, tile, drawn, by, the, player, is, immediately, discarded, unless, it, constitutes, a, win, standard, requirements, for, r, chi, are, that, the, hand, be, closed, or, have, no, melds, declared, other, than, a, concealed, kong, and, that, players, already, have, points, for, declaration, of, r, chi, a, player, who, declares, r, chi, and, wins, usually, receives, a, point, bonus, for, their, hand, directly, and, a, player, who, won, with, r, chi, also, has, the, advantage, to, open, the, inner, dora, which, leads, to, higher, possibilities, to, match, such, a, card, thus, has, more, chance, to, grant, additional, bonus, however, a, player, who, declares, r, chi, and, loses, is, usually, penalised, in, some, fashion, declaring, a, nonexistent, r, chi, is, also, penalised, in, some, way, in, some, variations, a, situation, in, which, all, four, players, declare, a, r, chi, is, an, automatic, drawn, game, as, it, reduces, the, game, down, to, pure, luck, i, e, who, gets, their, needed, tile, first, if, only, the, dead, wall, remains, or, if, no, dead, wall, exists, and, the, wall, is, depleted, and, no, one, has, won, the, hand, is, drawn, or, goulashed, a, new, hand, begins, and, depending, on, the, variant, the, game, wind, may, change, for, example, in, most, playing, circles, in, singapore, if, there, is, at, least, one, kong, when, the, hand, is, a, draw, the, following, player, of, the, dealer, becomes, the, next, dealer, otherwise, the, dealer, remains, dealer, japanese, mahjong, has, a, special, rule, called, sanchah, which, is, if, three, players, claim, the, same, discard, in, order, to, win, the, hand, is, drawn, one, reason, for, this, is, that, there, are, cases, in, which, bars, of, 1, 000, points, for, declaring, r, chi, cannot, be, divided, by, three, the, rule, is, treated, the, same, as, abortive, draws, in, japanese, mahjong, rules, allow, abortive, draws, to, be, declared, while, tiles, are, still, available, they, can, be, declared, under, the, following, conditions, scoring, in, mahjong, involves, points, with, a, monetary, value, for, points, agreed, upon, by, players, although, in, many, variations, scoreless, hands, are, possible, many, require, that, hands, be, of, some, point, value, in, order, to, win, the, hand, while, the, basic, rules, are, more, or, less, the, same, throughout, mahjong, the, greatest, divergence, between, variations, lies, in, the, scoring, systems, like, the, rules, there, is, a, generalized, system, of, scoring, based, on, the, method, of, winning, and, the, winning, hand, from, which, chinese, and, japanese, base, their, roots, american, mahjong, generally, has, greatly, divergent, scoring, rules, as, well, as, greatly, divergent, general, rules, because, of, the, large, differences, between, the, various, systems, of, scoring, especially, for, chinese, variants, groups, of, players, will, often, agree, on, particular, scoring, rules, before, a, game, points, terminology, of, which, differs, from, variation, to, variation, are, obtained, by, matching, the, winning, hand, with, different, criteria, scoring, different, values, the, points, obtained, may, be, modified, into, scores, for, each, player, using, some, typically, exponential, functions, some, criteria, may, be, also, in, terms, of, both, points, and, score, in, many, variations, the, dealer, receives, no, scoring, bonus, and, does, not, maintain, their, turn, by, winning, or, a, dead, hand, in, classical, mahjong, all, players, score, points, points, are, given, for, sets, and, hand, composition, and, winning, bonuses, doubled, and, redoubled, for, basic, patterns, sometimes, a, loser, may, score, more, points, than, a, winner, japanese, mahjong, has, a, complex, scoring, system, with, several, stages, of, scoring, rules, and, exceptions, evening, out, scores, and, bonus, points, at, the, end, of, a, match, korean, mahjong, has, a, simple, scoring, system, where, only, winner, scores, without, any, form, of, doubling, some, variations, give, points, for, concealed, hands, in, which, case, no, melds, are, made, except, by, winning, on, a, discard, in, old, hong, kong, mahjong, a, single, player, game, employs, the, tiles, of, mahjong, usually, played, on, computers, or, devices, gameplay, is, entirely, unrelated, to, mahjong, or, its, variations, and, is, a, recent, invention, a, two, player, version, was, published, by, nintendo, the, game, involves, stacking, tiles, face, up, in, various, elaborate, patterns, and, removing, uncovered, matching, tiles, at, the, end, of, rows, in, 1998, in, the, interest, of, dissociating, illegal, gambling, from, mahjong,

the, player, has, scored, eight, points, the, winner, of, a, game, receives, the, score, from, the, player, who, discards, the, winning, tile, plus, eight, basic, points, from, each, player, in, the,

games, involve, players, drawing, and, discarding, tiles, or, cards, to, make, melds, khanhoo, is, an, early, example, of, such, a, game, the, most, likely, ancestor, to, mahjong, was, p, ngh, which, was, played, with, 120, or, 150, cards, during, the, late, 19th, century, p, ngh, was, used, interchangeably, with, m, qu, in, both, card, and, tile, form, it, is, not, known, when, the, conversion, from, cards, to, tiles, took, place, precisely, but, it, most, likely, occurred, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, earliest, surviving, tile, sets, date, to, around, 1870, and, were, acquired, in, fuzhou, shanghai, and, ningbo, these, sets, differ, from, modern, ones, in, several, ways, in, the, glover, sets, there, were, no, flower, and, f, green, dragon, tiles, in, their, place, were, king, tiles, for, heaven, earth, man, and, harmony, and, also, for, each, of, the, 4, winds, which, may, have, acted, as, bonus, tiles, in, the, contemporaneous, himly, set, there, were, no, zh, ng, red, dragon, tiles, either, instead, there, were, the, wild, cards, known, as, cash, flower, string, flower, and, myriad, flower, plus, an, additional, tile, the, king, of, everything, these, early, jokers, are, still, found, in, the, vietnamese, and, thai, sets, they, may, have, been, removed, as, the, tiles, share, the, same, titles, as, the, leaders, of, the, taiping, rebellion, 1850, 1864, for, example, hong, xiuquan, was, the, self, styled, heavenly, king, of, great, peace, and, his, top, subordinates, were, called, east, king, south, king, west, king, and, north, king, the, ban, on, gambling, after, the, founding, of, the, people, s, republic, in, 1949, led, to, a, decline, in, playing, the, game, itself, was, banned, during, the, cultural, revolution, 1966, 1976, today, it, is, a, favorite, pastime, in, china, and, other, chinese, speaking, communities, the, first, western, records, about, mahjong, seem, to, correspond, to, the, papers, of, british, consul, general, f, e, b, harvey, around, the, time, when, he, served, as, consul, in, ningbo, during, the, 1860s, he, mentions, in, his, papers, making, the, acquaintance, of, an, english, fluent, rank, three, official, under, the, daoguang, emperor, chen, yumen, who, taught, him, the, game, in, the, same, writings, he, details, the, rules, he, was, taught, by, chen, in, 1895, british, sinologist, william, henry, wilkinson, wrote, a, paper, which, mentioned, a, set, of, cards, known, in, central, china, by, the, name, of, ma, chioh, literally, hemp, sparrow, which, he, maintained, was, the, origin, of, the,
