anal, sex, or, anal, intercourse, is, generally, the, insertion, and, thrusting, of, the, erect, penis, into, a, person, s, anus, or, anus, and, rectum, for, sexual, pleasure, other, forms, of, anal, sex, include, anal, fingering, the, use, of, sex, toys, anilingus, pegging, as, well, as, electrostimulation, and, erotic, torture, such, as, figging, although, anal, sex, most, commonly, means, penile, anal, penetration, sources, sometimes, use, anal, intercourse, to, exclusively, denote, penile, anal, penetration, and, anal, sex, to, denote, any, form, of, anal, sexual, activity, especially, between, pairings, as, opposed, to, anal, masturbation, most, homosexual, men, report, engaging, in, anal, sex, though, other, types, of, sexual, behaviour, are, more, frequently, practised, in, this, group, among, heterosexual, couples, anal, sex, is, probably, not, uncommon, and, may, be, becoming, more, prevalent, types, of, anal, sex, can, also, be, a, part, of, lesbian, sexual, practices, people, may, experience, pleasure, from, anal, sex, by, stimulation, of, the, anal, nerve, endings, and, orgasm, may, be, achieved, through, anal, penetration, by, indirect, stimulation, of, the, prostate, in, men, indirect, stimulation, of, the, clitoris, or, an, area, of, the, vagina, sometimes, called, the, g, spot, in, women, and, other, sensory, nerves, especially, the, pudendal, nerve, however, people, may, also, find, anal, sex, painful, sometimes, extremely, so, which, may, be, due, to, psychological, factors, in, some, cases, as, with, most, forms, of, sexual, activity, anal, sex, participants, risk, contracting, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, anal, sex, is, considered, a, high, risk, sexual, practice, because, of, the, vulnerability, of, the, anus, and, rectum, the, anal, and, rectal, tissue, are, delicate, and, do, not, provide, lubrication, like, the, vagina, does, so, they, can, easily, tear, and, permit, disease, transmission, especially, if, a, personal, lubricant, is, not, used, anal, sex, without, protection, of, a, condom, is, considered, the, riskiest, form, of, sexual, activity, and, therefore, health, authorities, such, as, the, world, health, organization, who, recommend, safe, sex, practices, for, anal, sex, strong, views, are, often, expressed, about, anal, sex, it, is, controversial, in, various, cultures, often, because, of, religious, prohibitions, against, anal, sex, among, males, or, teachings, about, the, procreative, purpose, of, sexual, activity, it, may, be, considered, taboo, or, unnatural, and, is, a, criminal, offense, in, some, countries, punishable, by, corporal, or, capital, punishment, by, contrast, anal, sex, may, also, be, considered, a, natural, and, valid, form, of, sexual, activity, as, fulfilling, as, other, desired, sexual, expressions, and, can, be, an, enhancing, or, primary, element, of, a, person, s, sex, life, the, abundance, of, nerve, endings, in, the, anal, region, and, rectum, can, make, anal, sex, pleasurable, for, men, and, women, the, internal, and, external, sphincter, muscles, control, the, opening, and, closing, of, the, anus, these, muscles, which, are, sensitive, membranes, made, up, of, many, nerve, endings, facilitate, pleasure, or, pain, during, anal, sex, human, sexuality, an, encyclopedia, states, that, the, inner, third, of, the, anal, canal, is, less, sensitive, to, touch, than, the, outer, two, thirds, but, is, more, sensitive, to, pressure, and, that, the, rectum, is, a, curved, tube, about, eight, or, nine, inches, long, and, has, the, capacity, like, the, anus, to, expand, research, indicates, that, anal, sex, occurs, significantly, less, frequently, than, other, sexual, behaviors, but, its, association, with, dominance, and, submission, as, well, as, taboo, makes, it, an, appealing, stimulus, to, people, of, all, sexual, orientations, in, addition, to, sexual, penetration, by, the, penis, people, may, use, sex, toys, such, as, a, dildo, a, butt, plug, or, anal, beads, engage, in, anal, fingering, anilingus, pegging, anal, masturbation, figging, or, fisting, for, anal, sexual, activity, and, different, sex, positions, may, also, be, included, fisting, is, the, least, practiced, of, the, activities, partly, because, it, is, uncommon, that, people, can, relax, enough, to, accommodate, an, object, as, big, as, a, fist, being, inserted, into, the, anus, in, a, male, receptive, partner, being, anally, penetrated, can, produce, a, pleasurable, sensation, due, to, the, object, of, insertion, rubbing, or, brushing, against, the, prostate, through, the, anal, wall, this, can, result, in, pleasurable, sensations, and, can, lead, to, an, orgasm, in, some, cases, prostate, stimulation, can, produce, a, deeper, orgasm, sometimes, described, by, men, as, more, widespread, and, intense, longer, lasting, and, allowing, for, greater, feelings, of, ecstasy, than, orgasm, elicited, by, penile, stimulation, only, the, prostate, is, located, next, to, the, rectum, and, is, the, larger, more, developed, male, homologue, variation, to, the, female, skene, s, glands, it, is, also, typical, for, a, man, to, not, reach, orgasm, as, a, receptive, partner, solely, from, anal, sex, general, statistics, indicate, that, 70, 80, of, women, require, direct, clitoral, stimulation, to, achieve, orgasm, the, vaginal, walls, contain, significantly, fewer, nerve, endings, than, the, clitoris, which, has, many, nerve, endings, specifically, intended, for, orgasm, and, therefore, intense, sexual, pleasure, including, orgasm, from, vaginal, sexual, stimulation, is, less, likely, to, occur, than, from, direct, clitoral, stimulation, in, the, majority, of, women, the, clitoris, is, composed, of, more, than, the, externally, visible, glans, head, the, vagina, for, example, is, flanked, on, each, side, by, the, clitoral, crura, the, internal, legs, of, the, clitoris, which, are, highly, sensitive, and, become, engorged, with, blood, when, sexually, aroused, indirect, stimulation, of, the, clitoris, through, anal, penetration, may, be, caused, by, the, shared, sensory, nerves, especially, the, pudendal, nerve, which, gives, off, the, inferior, anal, nerves, and, divides, into, the, perineal, nerve, and, the, dorsal, nerve, of, the, clitoris, although, the, anus, has, many, nerve, endings, their, purpose, is, not, specifically, for, inducing, orgasm, and, so, a, woman, achieving, orgasm, solely, by, anal, stimulation, is, rare, stimulation, from, anal, sex, can, additionally, be, affected, by, popular, perception, or, portrayals, of, the, activity, such, as, erotica, or, pornography, in, pornography, anal, sex, is, commonly, portrayed, as, a, desirable, painless, routine, that, does, not, require, personal, lubricant, this, can, result, in, couples, performing, anal, sex, without, care, and, men, and, women, believing, that, it, is, unusual, for, women, as, receptive, partners, to, find, discomfort, or, pain, instead, of, pleasure, from, the, activity, by, contrast, each, person, s, sphincter, muscles, react, to, penetration, differently, the, anal, sphincters, have, tissues, that, are, more, prone, to, tearing, and, the, anus, and, rectum, do, not, provide, lubrication, for, sexual, penetration, like, the, vagina, does, researchers, say, adequate, application, of, a, personal, lubricant, relaxation, and, communication, between, sexual, partners, are, crucial, to, avoid, pain, or, damage, to, the, anus, or, rectum, additionally, ensuring, that, the, anal, area, is, clean, and, the, bowel, is, empty, for, both, aesthetics, and, practicality, may, be, desired, by, participants, the, anal, sphincters, are, usually, tighter, than, the, pelvic, muscles, of, the, vagina, which, can, enhance, the, sexual, pleasure, for, the, inserting, male, during, male, to, female, anal, intercourse, because, of, the, pressure, applied, to, the, penis, men, may, also, enjoy, the, penetrative, role, during, anal, sex, because, of, its, association, with, dominance, because, it, is, made, more, alluring, by, a, female, partner, or, society, in, general, insisting, that, it, is, forbidden, or, because, it, presents, an, additional, option, for, penetration, while, some, women, find, being, a, receptive, partner, during, anal, intercourse, painful, or, uncomfortable, or, only, engage, in, the, act, to, please, a, male, sexual, partner, other, women, find, the, activity, pleasurable, or, prefer, it, to, vaginal, intercourse, in, a, 2010, clinical, review, article, of, heterosexual, anal, sex, anal, intercourse, is, used, to, specifically, denote, penile, anal, penetration, and, anal, sex, is, used, to, denote, any, form, of, anal, sexual, activity, the, review, suggests, that, anal, sex, is, exotic, among, the, sexual, practices, of, some, heterosexuals, and, that, for, a, certain, number, of, heterosexuals, anal, intercourse, is, pleasurable, exciting, and, perhaps, considered, more, intimate, than, vaginal, sex, anal, intercourse, is, sometimes, used, as, a, substitute, for, vaginal, intercourse, during, menstruation, the, likelihood, of, pregnancy, occurring, during, anal, sex, is, greatly, reduced, as, anal, sex, alone, cannot, lead, to, pregnancy, unless, sperm, is, somehow, transported, to, the, vaginal, opening, because, of, this, some, couples, practice, anal, intercourse, as, a, form, of, contraception, often, in, the, absence, of, a, condom, male, to, female, anal, sex, is, commonly, viewed, as, a, way, of, preserving, female, virginity, because, it, is, non, procreative, and, does, not, tear, the, hymen, a, person, especially, a, teenage, girl, or, woman, who, engages, in, anal, sex, or, other, sexual, activity, with, no, history, of, having, engaged, in, vaginal, intercourse, is, often, regarded, among, heterosexuals, and, researchers, as, not, having, yet, experienced, virginity, loss, this, is, sometimes, called, technical, virginity, heterosexuals, may, view, anal, sex, as, fooling, around, or, as, foreplay, scholar, laura, m, carpenter, stated, that, this, view, dates, to, the, late, 1600s, with, explicit, rules, appearing, around, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, as, in, marriage, manuals, defining, petting, as, literally, every, caress, known, to, married, couples, but, does, not, include, complete, sexual, intercourse, because, most, research, on, anal, intercourse, addresses, men, who, have, sex, with, men, little, data, exists, on, the, prevalence, of, anal, intercourse, among, heterosexual, couples, in, kimberly, r, mcbride, s, 2010, clinical, review, on, heterosexual, anal, intercourse, and, other, forms, of, anal, sexual, activity, it, is, suggested, that, changing, norms, may, affect, the, frequency, of, heterosexual, anal, sex, mcbride, and, her, colleagues, investigated, the, prevalence, of, non, intercourse, anal, sex, behaviors, among, a, sample, of, men, n, 1, 299, and, women, n, 1, 919, compared, to, anal, intercourse, experience, and, found, that, 51, of, men, and, 43, of, women, had, participated, in, at, least, one, act, of, oral, anal, sex, manual, anal, sex, or, anal, sex, toy, use, the, report, states, the, majority, of, men, n, 631, and, women, n, 856, who, reported, heterosexual, anal, intercourse, in, the, past, 12, months, were, in, exclusive, monogamous, relationships, 69, and, 73, respectively, the, review, added, that, because, relatively, little, attention, given, to, anal, intercourse, and, other, anal, sexual, behaviors, between, heterosexual, partners, this, means, that, it, is, quite, rare, to, have, research, that, specifically, differentiates, the, anus, as, a, sexual, organ, or, addresses, anal, sexual, function, or, dysfunction, as, legitimate, topics, as, a, result, we, do, not, know, the, extent, to, which, anal, intercourse, differs, qualitatively, from, coitus, according, to, a, 2010, study, from, the, national, survey, of, sexual, health, and, behavior, nsshb, that, was, authored, by, debby, herbenick, et, al, although, anal, intercourse, is, reported, by, fewer, women, than, other, partnered, sex, behaviors, partnered, women, in, the, age, groups, between, 18, and, 49, are, significantly, more, likely, to, report, having, anal, sex, in, the, past, 90, days, women, engaged, in, anal, intercourse, less, commonly, than, men, vaginal, intercourse, was, practiced, more, than, insertive, anal, intercourse, among, men, but, 13, to, 15, of, men, aged, 25, to, 49, practiced, insertive, anal, intercourse, with, regard, to, adolescents, limited, data, also, exists, this, may, be, because, of, the, taboo, nature, of, anal, sex, and, that, teenagers, and, caregivers, subsequently, avoid, talking, to, one, another, about, the, topic, it, is, also, common, for, subject, review, panels, and, schools, to, avoid, the, subject, a, 2000, study, found, that, 22, 9, of, college, students, who, self, identified, as, non, virgins, had, anal, sex, they, used, condoms, during, anal, sex, 20, 9, of, the, time, as, compared, with, 42, 9, of, the, time, with, vaginal, intercourse, anal, sex, being, more, common, among, heterosexuals, today, than, it, was, previously, has, been, linked, to, the, increase, in, consumption, of, anal, pornography, among, men, especially, among, those, who, view, it, on, a, regular, basis, seidman, et, al, argued, that, cheap, accessible, and, especially, interactive, media, have, enabled, many, more, people, to, produce, as, well, as, consume, pornography, and, that, this, modern, way, of, producing, pornography, in, addition, to, the, buttocks, and, anus, having, become, more, eroticized, has, led, to, a, significant, interest, in, or, obsession, with, anal, sex, among, men, most, homosexual, men, are, reported, to, engage, in, anal, sex, among, men, who, have, anal, sex, with, other, men, the, insertive, partner, may, be, referred, to, as, the, top, and, the, one, being, penetrated, may, be, referred, to, as, the, bottom, those, who, enjoy, either, role, may, be, referred, to, as, versatile, some, men, who, have, sex, with, men, however, find, that, being, a, receptive, partner, during, anal, sex, makes, them, question, their, masculinity, reports, regarding, the, prevalence, of, anal, sex, among, gay, men, and, other, men, who, have, sex, with, men, vary, a, survey, in, the, advocate, in, 1994, indicated, that, 46, of, gay, men, preferred, to, penetrate, their, partners, while, 43, preferred, to, be, the, receptive, partner, other, sources, suggest, that, roughly, three, fourths, of, gay, men, have, had, anal, sex, at, one, time, or, another, with, an, equal, percentage, participating, as, tops, and, bottoms, a, 2012, nsshb, sex, survey, in, the, u, s, suggests, high, lifetime, participation, in, anal, sex, among, gay, men, 83, 3, report, ever, taking, part, in, anal, sex, in, the, insertive, position, and, 90, in, the, receptive, position, even, if, only, between, a, third, and, a, quarter, self, report, very, recent, engagement, in, the, practice, defined, as, 30, days, or, less, oral, sex, and, mutual, masturbation, are, more, common, than, anal, stimulation, among, men, in, sexual, relationships, with, other, men, according, to, weiten, et, al, anal, intercourse, is, generally, more, popular, among, gay, male, couples, than, among, heterosexual, couples, but, it, ranks, behind, oral, sex, and, mutual, masturbation, among, both, sexual, orientations, in, prevalence, wellings, et, al, reported, that, the, equation, of, homosexual, with, anal, sex, among, men, is, common, among, lay, and, health, professionals, alike, and, that, yet, an, internet, survey, of, 180, 000, msm, across, europe, emis, 2011, showed, that, oral, sex, was, most, commonly, practised, followed, by, mutual, masturbation, with, anal, intercourse, in, third, place, women, may, sexually, stimulate, a, man, s, anus, by, fingering, the, exterior, or, interior, areas, of, the, anus, they, may, also, stimulate, the, perineum, which, for, males, is, between, the, base, of, the, scrotum, and, the, anus, massage, the, prostate, or, engage, in, anilingus, sex, toys, such, as, a, dildo, may, also, be, used, the, practice, of, a, woman, penetrating, a, man, s, anus, with, a, strap, on, dildo, for, sexual, activity, is, called, pegging, reece, et, al, reported, in, 2010, that, receptive, anal, intercourse, is, infrequent, among, men, overall, stating, that, an, estimated, 7, of, men, 14, to, 94, years, old, reported, being, a, receptive, partner, during, anal, intercourse, the, bmj, stated, in, 1999, there, are, little, published, data, on, how, many, heterosexual, men, would, like, their, anus, to, be, sexually, stimulated, in, a, heterosexual, relationship, anecdotally, it, is, a, substantial, number, what, data, we, do, have, almost, all, relate, to, penetrative, sexual, acts, and, the, superficial, contact, of, the, anal, ring, with, fingers, or, the, tongue, is, even, less, well, documented, but, may, be, assumed, to, be, a, common, sexual, activity, for, men, of, all, sexual, orientations, with, regard, to, lesbian, sexual, practices, anal, sex, includes, anal, fingering, use, of, a, dildo, or, other, sex, toys, or, anilingus, there, is, less, research, on, anal, sexual, activity, among, women, who, have, sex, with, women, compared, to, couples, of, other, sexual, orientations, in, 1987, a, non, scientific, study, munson, was, conducted, of, more, than, 100, members, of, a, lesbian, social, organization, in, colorado, when, asked, what, techniques, they, used, in, their, last, ten, sexual, encounters, lesbians, in, their, 30s, were, twice, as, likely, as, other, age, groups, to, engage, in, anal, stimulation, with, a, finger, or, dildo, a, 2014, study, of, partnered, lesbian, women, in, canada, and, the, u, s, found, that, 7, engaged, in, anal, stimulation, or, penetration, at, least, once, a, week, about, 10, did, so, monthly, and, 70, did, not, at, all, anilingus, is, also, less, often, practiced, among, female, same, sex, couples, anal, sex, can, expose, its, participants, to, two, principal, dangers, infections, due, to, the, high, number, of, infectious, microorganisms, not, found, elsewhere, on, the, body, and, physical, damage, to, the, anus, and, rectum, due, to, their, fragility, unprotected, penile, anal, penetration, colloquially, known, as, barebacking, carries, a, higher, risk, of, passing, on, sexually, transmitted, infections, stis, because, the, anal, sphincter, is, a, delicate, easily, torn, tissue, that, can, provide, an, entry, for, pathogens, use, of, condoms, ample, lubrication, to, reduce, the, risk, of, tearing, and, safer, sex, practices, in, general, reduce, the, risk, of, stis, however, a, condom, can, break, or, otherwise, come, off, during, anal, sex, and, this, is, more, likely, to, happen, with, anal, sex, than, with, other, sex, acts, because, of, the, tightness, of, the, anal, sphincters, during, friction, unprotected, receptive, anal, sex, with, an, hiv, positive, partner, is, the, sex, act, most, likely, to, result, in, hiv, transmission, as, with, other, sexual, practices, people, without, sound, knowledge, about, the, sexual, risks, involved, are, susceptible, to, stis, because, of, the, view, that, anal, sex, is, not, real, sex, and, therefore, does, not, result, in, virginity, loss, or, pregnancy, teenagers, and, other, young, people, who, are, unaware, of, the, risks, of, the, anal, sex, may, consider, vaginal, intercourse, riskier, than, anal, intercourse, and, also, the, may, believe, that, an, sti, can, only, result, from, vaginal, intercourse, it, may, be, because, of, these, views, that, condom, use, with, anal, sex, is, often, reported, to, be, low, and, inconsistent, across, all, groups, in, various, countries, although, anal, sex, alone, does, not, lead, to, pregnancy, pregnancy, can, still, occur, with, anal, sex, or, other, forms, of, sexual, activity, if, the, penis, is, near, the, vagina, such, as, during, intercrural, sex, or, other, genital, genital, rubbing, and, its, sperm, is, deposited, near, the, vagina, s, entrance, and, travels, along, the, vagina, s, lubricating, fluids, the, risk, of, pregnancy, can, also, occur, without, the, penis, being, near, the, vagina, because, sperm, may, be, transported, to, the, vaginal, opening, by, the, vagina, coming, in, contact, with, fingers, or, other, non, genital, body, parts, that, have, come, in, contact, with, semen, there, are, a, variety, of, factors, that, make, male, to, female, anal, intercourse, riskier, than, vaginal, intercourse, for, women, including, the, risk, of, hiv, transmission, being, higher, for, anal, intercourse, than, for, vaginal, intercourse, the, risk, of, injury, to, the, woman, during, anal, intercourse, is, also, significantly, higher, than, the, risk, of, injury, to, her, during, vaginal, intercourse, because, of, the, durability, of, the, vaginal, tissues, compared, to, the, anal, tissues, additionally, if, a, man, moves, from, anal, intercourse, immediately, to, vaginal, intercourse, without, a, condom, or, without, changing, it, infections, can, arise, in, the, vagina, or, urinary, tract, due, to, bacteria, present, within, the, anus, these, infections, can, also, result, from, switching, between, vaginal, sex, and, anal, sex, by, the, use, of, fingers, or, sex, toys, pain, during, receptive, anal, sex, among, gay, men, or, men, who, have, sex, with, men, is, formally, known, as, anodyspareunia, in, one, study, 61, of, gay, or, bisexual, men, said, they, experienced, painful, receptive, anal, sex, and, that, it, was, the, most, frequent, sexual, difficulty, they, had, experienced, by, contrast, 24, of, gay, or, bisexual, men, stated, that, they, always, experienced, some, degree, of, pain, during, anal, sex, and, about, 12, of, gay, men, find, it, too, painful, to, pursue, receptive, anal, sex, it, was, concluded, that, the, perception, of, anal, sex, as, painful, is, as, likely, to, be, psychologically, or, emotionally, based, as, it, is, to, be, physically, based, factors, predictive, of, pain, during, anal, sex, include, inadequate, lubrication, feeling, tense, or, anxious, lack, of, stimulation, as, well, as, lack, of, social, ease, with, being, gay, and, being, closeted, research, has, found, that, psychological, factors, can, in, fact, be, the, primary, contributors, to, the, experience, of, pain, during, anal, intercourse, and, that, adequate, communication, between, sexual, partners, can, prevent, it, countering, the, notion, that, pain, is, always, inevitable, during, anal, sex, anal, sex, can, exacerbate, hemorrhoids, and, therefore, result, in, bleeding, in, other, cases, the, formation, of, a, hemorrhoid, is, attributed, to, anal, sex, if, bleeding, occurs, as, a, result, of, anal, sex, it, may, also, be, because, of, a, tear, in, the, anal, or, rectal, tissues, an, anal, fissure, or, perforation, a, hole, in, the, colon, the, latter, of, which, being, a, serious, medical, issue, that, should, be, remedied, by, immediate, medical, attention, because, of, the, rectum, s, lack, of, elasticity, the, anal, mucous, membrane, being, thin, and, small, blood, vessels, being, present, directly, beneath, the, mucous, membrane, tiny, tears, and, bleeding, in, the, rectum, usually, result, from, penetrative, anal, sex, though, the, bleeding, is, usually, minor, and, therefore, usually, not, visible, by, contrast, to, other, anal, sexual, behaviors, anal, fisting, poses, a, more, serious, danger, of, damage, due, to, the, deliberate, stretching, of, the, anal, and, rectal, tissues, anal, fisting, injuries, include, anal, sphincter, lacerations, and, rectal, and, sigmoid, colon, rectosigmoid, perforation, which, might, result, in, death, repetitive, penetrative, anal, sex, may, result, in, the, anal, sphincters, becoming, weakened, which, may, cause, rectal, prolapse, or, affect, the, ability, to, hold, in, feces, a, condition, known, as, fecal, incontinence, rectal, prolapse, is, relatively, uncommon, however, especially, in, men, and, its, causes, are, not, well, understood, kegel, exercises, have, been, used, to, strengthen, the, anal, sphincters, and, overall, pelvic, floor, and, may, help, prevent, or, remedy, fecal, incontinence, people, who, have, anal, intercourse, may, have, an, increased, risk, of, anal, cancer, most, cases, of, anal, cancer, are, related, to, infection, with, the, human, papilloma, virus, hpv, the, risk, of, anal, cancer, through, anal, sex, is, attributed, to, hpv, infection, which, is, often, contracted, through, unprotected, anal, sex, anal, cancer, is, significantly, less, common, than, cancer, of, the, colon, or, rectum, colorectal, cancer, the, american, cancer, society, estimates, that, in, 2023, there, were, approximately, 9, 760, new, cases, 6, 580, in, women, and, 3, 180, in, men, and, approximately, 1, 870, deaths, 860, women, and, 1, 010, men, in, the, united, states, and, that, though, anal, cancer, has, been, on, the, rise, for, many, years, it, is, mainly, diagnosed, in, adults, with, an, average, age, being, in, the, early, 60s, and, it, affects, women, somewhat, more, often, than, men, different, cultures, have, had, different, views, on, anal, sex, throughout, human, history, with, some, cultures, more, positive, about, the, activity, than, others, historically, anal, sex, has, been, restricted, or, condemned, especially, with, regard, to, religious, beliefs, it, has, also, commonly, been, used, as, a, form, of, domination, usually, with, the, active, partner, the, one, who, is, penetrating, representing, masculinity, and, the, passive, partner, the, one, who, is, being, penetrated, representing, femininity, a, number, of, cultures, have, especially, recorded, the, practice, of, anal, sex, between, males, and, anal, sex, between, males, has, been, especially, stigmatized, or, punished, in,
