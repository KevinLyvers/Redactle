the, hobby, of, collecting, includes, seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying, storing, and, maintaining, items, that, are, of, interest, to, an, individual, collector, collections, differ, in, a, wide, variety, of, respects, most, obviously, in, the, nature, and, scope, of, the, objects, contained, but, also, in, purpose, presentation, and, so, forth, the, range, of, possible, subjects, for, a, collection, is, practically, unlimited, and, collectors, have, realised, a, vast, number, of, these, possibilities, in, practice, although, some, are, much, more, popular, than, others, in, collections, of, manufactured, items, the, objects, may, be, antique, or, simply, collectable, antiques, are, collectable, items, at, least, 100, years, old, while, other, collectables, are, arbitrarily, recent, the, word, vintage, describes, relatively, old, collectables, that, are, not, yet, antiques, collecting, is, a, childhood, hobby, for, some, people, but, for, others, it, is, a, lifelong, pursuit, or, something, started, in, adulthood, collectors, who, begin, early, in, life, often, modify, their, goals, when, they, get, older, some, novice, collectors, start, by, purchasing, items, that, appeal, to, them, and, then, slowly, work, at, learning, how, to, build, a, collection, while, others, prefer, to, develop, some, background, in, the, field, before, starting, to, buy, items, the, emergence, of, the, internet, as, a, global, forum, for, different, collectors, has, resulted, in, many, isolated, enthusiasts, finding, each, other, the, most, obvious, way, to, categorize, collections, is, by, the, type, of, objects, collected, most, collections, are, of, manufactured, commercial, items, but, natural, objects, such, as, birds, eggs, butterflies, rocks, and, seashells, can, also, be, the, subject, of, a, collection, for, some, collectors, the, criterion, for, inclusion, might, not, be, the, type, of, object, but, some, incidental, property, such, as, the, identity, of, its, original, owner, some, collectors, are, generalists, with, very, broad, criteria, for, inclusion, while, others, focus, on, a, subtopic, within, their, area, of, interest, some, collectors, accumulate, arbitrarily, many, objects, that, meet, the, thematic, and, quality, requirements, of, their, collection, others, called, completists, or, completionists, aim, to, acquire, all, items, in, a, well, defined, set, that, can, in, principle, be, completed, and, others, seek, a, limited, number, of, items, per, category, e, g, one, representative, item, per, year, of, manufacture, or, place, of, purchase, collecting, items, by, country, e, g, one, collectible, per, country, is, very, common, the, monetary, value, of, objects, is, important, to, some, collectors, but, irrelevant, to, others, some, collectors, maintain, objects, in, pristine, condition, while, others, use, the, items, they, collect, after, a, collectable, has, been, purchased, its, retail, price, no, longer, applies, and, its, value, is, linked, to, what, is, called, the, secondary, market, there, is, no, secondary, market, for, an, item, unless, someone, is, willing, to, buy, it, and, an, object, s, value, is, whatever, the, buyer, is, willing, to, pay, depending, on, age, condition, supply, demand, and, other, factors, individuals, auctioneers, and, secondary, retailers, may, sell, a, collectable, for, either, more, or, less, than, what, they, originally, paid, for, it, special, or, limited, edition, collectables, are, created, with, the, goal, of, increasing, demand, and, value, of, an, item, due, to, its, rarity, a, price, guide, is, a, resource, such, as, a, book, or, website, that, lists, typical, selling, prices, products, often, become, more, valuable, with, age, the, term, antique, generally, refers, to, manufactured, items, made, over, 100, years, ago, although, in, some, fields, such, as, antique, cars, the, time, frame, is, less, stringent, for, antique, furniture, the, limit, has, traditionally, been, set, in, the, 1830s, collectors, and, dealers, may, use, the, word, vintage, to, describe, older, collectables, that, are, too, young, to, be, called, antiques, including, art, deco, and, art, nouveau, items, carnival, and, depression, glass, etc, items, which, were, once, everyday, objects, but, may, now, be, collectable, as, almost, all, examples, produced, have, been, destroyed, or, discarded, are, called, ephemera, psychological, factors, can, play, a, role, in, both, the, motivation, for, keeping, a, collection, and, the, impact, it, has, on, the, collector, s, life, these, factors, can, be, positive, or, negative, the, hobby, of, collecting, often, goes, hand, in, hand, with, an, interest, in, the, objects, collected, and, what, they, represent, for, example, collecting, postcards, may, reflect, an, interest, in, different, places, and, cultures, for, this, reason, collecting, can, have, educational, benefits, and, some, collectors, even, become, experts, in, their, field, maintaining, a, collection, can, be, a, relaxing, activity, that, counteracts, the, stress, of, life, while, providing, a, purposeful, pursuit, which, prevents, boredom, the, hobby, can, lead, to, social, connections, between, people, with, similar, interests, and, the, development, of, new, friendships, it, has, also, been, shown, to, be, particularly, common, among, academics, collecting, for, most, people, is, a, choice, but, for, some, it, can, be, a, compulsion, sharing, characteristics, with, obsessive, hoarding, when, collecting, is, passed, between, generations, it, might, sometimes, be, that, children, have, inherited, symptoms, of, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, collecting, can, sometimes, reflect, a, fear, of, scarcity, or, of, discarding, something, and, then, later, regretting, it, carl, jung, speculated, that, the, widespread, appeal, of, collecting, is, connected, to, the, hunting, and, gathering, that, was, once, necessary, for, human, survival, collecting, is, also, associated, with, memory, by, association, and, the, need, for, the, human, brain, to, catalogue, and, organise, information, and, give, meaning, to, ones, actions, collecting, is, a, practice, with, a, very, old, cultural, history, in, mesopotamia, collecting, practices, have, been, noted, among, royalty, and, elites, as, far, back, as, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, the, egyptian, ptolemaic, dynasty, collected, books, from, all, over, the, known, world, at,

time, from, the, money, given, by, the, church, and, kings, this, citizenship, tradition, continues, today, with, the, work, of, private, art, collectors, many, of, the, world, s, popular, museums, from, the, metropolitan, in, new, york, city, to, the, thyssen, in, madrid, or, the, franz, mayer, in, mexico, city, have, collections, formed, by, the, collectors, that, donated, them, to, be, seen, by, the, general, public, the, collecting, hobby, is, a, modern, descendant, of, the, cabinet, of, curiosities, which, was, common, among, scholars, with, the, means, and, opportunities, to, acquire, unusual, items, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, planned, collecting, of, ephemeral, publications, goes, back, at, least, to, george, thomason, in, the, reign, of, charles, i, and, samuel, pepys,

with, the, prosperity, and, increased, leisure, for, some, in, the, later, 19th, century, in, industrial, countries, that, was, when, collecting, such, items, as, antique, china, furniture, and,

cradle, of, collecting, in, c, rdoba, argentina, located, 40, km, away, from, the, capital, city, in, agua, de, oro, san, leonardo, s, building, was, built, in, 1930, by, the, italian, artist, and, architect, augusto, c, sar, ferrari, the, place, worked, first, as, the, residence, of, a, priest, and, then, in, the, 60, s, and, 70, s, it, was, acquired, by, a, couple, who, exploited, the, place, as, a, summer, hotel, later, on, the, building, was, sold, again, to, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, was, a, derelict, building, for, several, years, until, the, current, owners, claudia, gonzales, and, eduardo, arguello, bought, it, in, 2007, and, have, owned, it, till, nowadays, both, owners, have, been, collectors, since, their, twenties, and, seventeen, years, ago, they, decided, to, restore, the, property, and, turn, it, into, what, it, is, today, a, boutique, hotel, antique, shop, gallery, art, and, a, restaurant, that, is, replete, with, all, the, antiques, they, have, collected, through, the, years, in, 2023, the, place, was, declared, as, the, center, of, collecting, of, c, rdoba, and, the, owners, also, came, up, with, the, idea, of, the, crononauta, an, event, that, was, first, held, during, easter, in, that, year, and, that, will, take, place, the, same, week, annually, this, show, not, only, allows, a, number, of, collectors, of, different, types, of, objects, to, expose, their, collections, but, it, also, presents, an, opportunity, to, get, to, know, the, different, exhibitions, in, the, art, gallery, and, enjoy, the, local, gastronomy, at, the, restaurant, in, an, interview, claudia, and, eduardo, reflected, on, how, their, journey, into, collecting, unfolded, naturally, over, time, while, they, had, always, been, drawn, to, acquiring, various, objects, it, wasn, t, until, later, that, they, began, to, see, it, as, a, formal, passion, for, collecting, when, asked, about, the, motivation, behind, their, collection, they, made, it, clear, that, their, primary, driver, is, personal, enjoyment, with, only, a, small, percentage, being, about, business, according, to, them, collecting, is, about, 95, passion, as, most, collectors, purchase, items, without, the, intent, to, sell, unless, it, s, to, make, space, for, something, even, more, special, as, active, members, of, the, c, rculo, de, coleccionistas, de, c, rdoba, they, regularly, engage, with, fellow, collectors, to, exchange, knowledge, and, help, one, another, find, new, treasures, their, collection, is, centered, on, corporeal, advertisements, from, early, 20th, century, shops, many, of, which, are, unique, and, cannot, be, easily, replicated, they, view, their, collection, as, more, than, just, a, personal, endeavor, by, showcasing, these, pieces, at, san, leonardo, they, create, an, opportunity, for, guests, to, experience, and, appreciate, relics, from, a, different, era, claudia, and, eduardo, found, san, leonardo, s, large, historical, setting, to, be, an, ideal, space, to, house, their, collections, they, didn, t, initially, foresee, how, significant, the, project, would, become, but, step, by, step, the, hotel, evolved, into, a, cultural, hotspot, today, it, draws, visitors, from, various, backgrounds, encouraging, curiosity, in, both, younger, and, older, generations, to, explore, history, and, potentially, begin, collecting, themselves, as, they, see, it, they, are, merely, temporary, stewards, of, these, items, knowing, the, collection, will, live, on, long, after, them, preserving, its, value, for, future, generations, of, collectors
