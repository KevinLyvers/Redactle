tung, the, international, olympic, committee, ioc, was, founded, in, 1894, when, pierre, de, coubertin, a, french, pedagogue, and, historian, sought, to, promote, international, understanding, through, sporting, competition, the, first, edition, of, the, olympic, games, was, held, in, athens, in, 1896, and, attracted, just, 245, competitors, of, whom, more, than, 200, were, greek, and, only, 14, countries, were, represented, nevertheless, no, international, events, of, this, magnitude, had, been, organised, before, female, athletes, were, not, allowed, to, compete, though, one, woman, stamata, revithi, ran, the, marathon, course, on, her, own, saying, if, the, committee, doesn, t, let, me, compete, i, will, go, after, them, regardless, women, first, participated, officially, in, the, 1900, paris, games, with, 22, women, competing, in, five, sports, female, participation, has, increased, dramatically, since, then, with, nearly, half, of, the, athletes, in, recent, games, being, women, the, 1896, summer, olympics, officially, known, as, the, games, of, the, olympiad, was, an, international, multi, sport, event, which, was, celebrated, in, athens, greece, from, 6, to, 15, april, 1896, it, was, the, first, olympic, games, held, in, the, modern, era, about, 100, 000, people, attended, for, the, opening, of, the, games, the, athletes, came, from, 14, nations, with, most, coming, from, greece, although, greece, had, the, most, athletes, the, u, s, finished, with, the, most, champions, 11, americans, placed, first, in, their, events, vs, the, 10, from, greece, ancient, greece, was, the, birthplace, of, the, olympic, games, consequently, athens, was, perceived, to, be, an, appropriate, choice, to, stage, the, inaugural, modern, games, it, was, unanimously, chosen, as, the, host, city, during, a, congress, organised, by, pierre, de, coubertin, in, paris, on, 23, june, 1894, the, ioc, was, also, established, during, this, congress, despite, many, obstacles, and, setbacks, the, 1896, olympics, were, regarded, as, a, great, success, the, games, had, the, largest, international, participation, of, any, sporting, event, to, that, date, panathinaiko, stadium, the, first, big, stadium, in, the, modern, world, overflowed, with, the, largest, crowd, ever, to, watch, a, sporting, event, the, highlight, for, the, greeks, was, the, marathon, victory, by, their, compatriot, spiridon, louis, a, water, carrier, he, won, in, 2, hours, 58, minutes, and, 50, seconds, setting, off, wild, celebrations, at, the, stadium, the, most, successful, competitor, was, german, wrestler, and, gymnast, carl, schuhmann, who, won, four, gold, medals, greek, officials, and, the, public, were, enthusiastic, about, the, experience, of, hosting, an, olympic, games, this, feeling, was, shared, by, many, of, the, athletes, who, even, demanded, that, athens, be, the, permanent, olympic, host, city, the, ioc, intended, for, subsequent, games, to, be, rotated, to, various, host, cities, around, the, world, the, second, olympics, was, held, in, paris, four, years, later, the, 1900, summer, olympics, in, paris, attracted, more, than, four, times, as, many, athletes, including, 20, women, who, were, allowed, to, officially, compete, for, the, first, time, in, croquet, golf, sailing, and, tennis, the, games, were, integrated, with, the, paris, world, s, fair, and, lasted, over, five, months, it, has, been, disputed, which, exact, events, were, olympic, as, some, events, were, for, professionals, some, had, restricted, eligibility, and, others, lacked, international, competitors, tensions, caused, by, the, russo, japanese, war, and, the, difficulty, of, getting, to, st, louis, may, have, contributed, to, the, fact, that, very, few, top, ranked, athletes, from, outside, the, us, and, canada, took, part, in, the, 1904, games, the, first, games, held, outside, europe, the, second, international, olympic, games, in, athens, as, they, were, called, at, the, time, were, held, in, 1906, the, ioc, does, not, currently, recognise, these, games, as, being, official, olympic, games, although, many, historians, do, and, credit, the, 1906, games, with, preventing, the, demise, of, the, olympics, the, 1906, athens, games, were, the, first, of, an, alternating, series, of, games, to, be, held, in, athens, in, even, non, olympic, years, but, the, series, failed, to, materialise, the, games, were, more, successful, than, the, 1900, and, 1904, games, with, over, 850, athletes, competing, and, contributed, positively, to, the, success, of, future, games, the, 1908, london, games, saw, numbers, rise, again, as, well, as, the, first, running, of, the, marathon, over, its, now, standard, distance, of, 42, 195, km, 26, miles, 385, yards, the, first, olympic, marathon, in, 1896, a, male, only, race, was, raced, at, a, distance, of, 40, km, 24, miles, 85, yards, the, new, marathon, distance, was, chosen, to, ensure, that, the, race, finished, in, front, of, the, box, occupied, by, the, british, royal, family, thus, the, marathon, had, been, 40, km, 24, 9, mi, for, the, first, games, in, 1896, but, was, subsequently, varied, by, up, to, 2, km, 1, 2, mi, due, to, local, conditions, such, as, street, and, stadium, layout, at, the, six, olympic, games, between, 1900, and, 1920, the, marathon, was, raced, over, six, distances, the, games, saw, great, britain, winning, 146, medals, 99, more, than, second, placed, americans, its, best, result, to, this, day, at, the, end, of, the, 1908, marathon, the, italian, runner, dorando, pietri, was, first, to, enter, the, stadium, but, he, was, clearly, in, distress, and, collapsed, of, exhaustion, before, he, could, complete, the, event, he, was, helped, over, the, finish, line, by, concerned, race, officials, and, later, disqualified, for, that, as, compensation, for, the, missing, medal, queen, alexandra, gave, pietri, a, gilded, silver, cup, arthur, conan, doyle, wrote, a, special, report, about, the, race, in, the, daily, mail, the, games, continued, to, grow, attracting, 2, 504, competitors, to, stockholm, in, 1912, including, the, great, all, rounder, jim, thorpe, who, won, both, the, decathlon, and, pentathlon, thorpe, had, previously, played, a, few, games, of, baseball, for, a, fee, and, saw, his, medals, stripped, for, this, breach, of, amateurism, after, complaints, from, avery, brundage, they, were, reinstated, in, 1983, 30, years, after, his, death, the, games, at, stockholm, were, the, first, to, fulfil, pierre, de, coubertin, s, original, idea, for, the, first, time, since, the, games, started, in, 1896, all, five, inhabited, continents, were, represented, with, athletes, competing, in, the, same, stadium, the, scheduled, 1916, summer, olympics, were, to, be, held, in, berlin, cancelled, following, the, onset, of, world, war, i, the, 1920, antwerp, games, in, war, ravaged, belgium, were, a, subdued, affair, but, again, drew, a, record, number, of, competitors, this, record, only, stood, until, 1924, when, the, paris, games, involved, 3, 000, competitors, the, greatest, of, whom, was, finnish, runner, paavo, nurmi, the, flying, finn, won, three, team, gold, medals, and, the, individual, 1, 500, and, 5, 000, meter, runs, the, latter, two, on, the, same, day, the, 1928, amsterdam, games, was, notable, for, being, the, first, games, which, allowed, females, to, compete, at, track, field, athletics, and, benefited, greatly, from, the, general, prosperity, of, the, times, alongside, the, first, appearance, of, sponsorship, of, the, games, from, the, coca, cola, company, the, 1928, games, saw, the, introduction, of, a, standard, medal, design, with, the, ioc, choosing, giuseppe, cassioli, s, depiction, of, greek, goddess, nike, with, a, winner, being, carried, by, a, crowd, of, people, this, design, was, used, up, until, 1972, the, 1932, los, angeles, games, were, affected, by, the, great, depression, which, contributed, to, the, low, number, of, competitors, the, 1936, berlin, games, were, seen, by, the, german, government, as, a, golden, opportunity, to, promote, their, ideology, the, ruling, nazi, party, commissioned, film, maker, leni, riefenstahl, to, film, the, games, the, result, olympia, was, widely, considered, to, be, a, masterpiece, despite, the, infusion, of, adolf, hitler, s, theories, of, aryan, racial, superiority, individually, african, american, sprinter, and, long, jumper, jesse, owens, won, four, gold, medals, while, the, host, nation, won, the, most, gold, and, overall, medals, the, 1936, berlin, games, also, saw, the, introduction, of, the, torch, relay, due, to, world, war, ii, the, 1940, games, due, to, be, held, in, tokyo, and, temporarily, relocated, to, helsinki, upon, the, outbreak, of, the, war, were, cancelled, the, 1944, games, were, due, to, be, held, in, london, but, were, also, cancelled, instead, london, hosted, the, first, games, after, the, end, of, the, war, in, 1948, the, first, post, war, games, were, held, in, 1948, in, london, with, both, germany, and, japan, excluded, dutch, sprinter, fanny, blankers, koen, won, four, gold, medals, on, the, track, emulating, owens, achievement, in, berlin, at, the, 1952, helsinki, games, the, ussr, team, competed, for, the, first, time, and, quickly, emerged, as, one, of, the, dominant, teams, finishing, second, in, the, number, of, gold, and, overall, medals, won, their, immediate, success, might, be, explained, by, the, advent, of, the, state, sponsored, full, time, amateur, athlete, the, ussr, entered, teams, of, athletes, who, were, all, nominally, students, soldiers, or, working, in, a, profession, but, many, of, whom, were, in, reality, paid, by, the, state, to, train, on, a, full, time, basis, hence, violating, amateur, rules, finland, made, a, legend, of, an, amiable, czechoslovak, army, lieutenant, named, emil, z, topek, who, was, intent, on, improving, on, his, single, gold, and, silver, medals, from, 1948, having, first, won, both, the, 10, 000, and, 5, 000, meter, races, he, also, entered, the, marathon, despite, having, never, previously, raced, at, that, distance, pacing, himself, by, chatting, with, the, other, race, leaders, z, topek, led, from, about, halfway, slowly, dropping, the, remaining, contenders, to, win, by, two, and, a, half, minutes, and, completed, a, trio, of, wins, the, 1956, melbourne, games, the, first, in, the, southern, hemisphere, were, largely, successful, with, the, exception, of, a, water, polo, match, between, hungary, and, the, soviet, union, which, ended, in, a, pitched, battle, between, the, teams, on, account, of, the, soviet, invasion, of, hungary, the, equestrian, events, were, held, in, stockholm, due, to, a, foot, and, mouth, disease, outbreak, in, britain, at, the, time, and, the, strict, quarantine, laws, of, australia, at, the, 1960, rome, games, a, young, light, heavyweight, boxer, named, cassius, clay, later, known, as, muhammad, ali, arrived, on, the, scene, ali, would, later, throw, his, gold, medal, away, in, disgust, after, being, refused, service, in, a, whites, only, restaurant, in, his, home, town, of, louisville, kentucky, he, was, awarded, a, new, medal, 36, years, later, at, the, 1996, olympics, in, atlanta, other, notable, performers, in, 1960, included, wilma, rudolph, a, gold, medallist, in, the, 100, meters, 200, meters, and, 4, 100, meters, relay, events, the, 1964, tokyo, games, were, the, first, to, be, held, in, asia, and, to, be, broadcast, worldwide, on, television, enabled, by, the, recent, advent, of, communication, satellites, these, games, marked, a, turning, point, in, the, global, visibility, and, popularity, of, the, olympics, and, are, credited, for, heralding, the, modern, age, of, telecommunications, judo, debuted, as, an, official, sport, and, dutch, judoka, anton, geesink, caused, a, stir, when, he, won, the, final, of, the, open, weight, division, defeating, akio, kaminaga, in, front, of, his, home, crowd, performances, at, the, 1968, games, in, mexico, city, were, affected, by, the, altitude, of, the, host, city, these, games, introduced, the, now, universal, fosbury, flop, a, technique, which, won, american, high, jumper, dick, fosbury, the, gold, medal, in, the, medal, award, ceremony, for, the, men, s, 200, meter, race, black, american, athletes, tommie, smith, gold, medal, winner, and, john, carlos, bronze, medal, winner, took, a, stand, for, civil, rights, by, raising, their, black, gloved, fists, and, wearing, black, socks, in, lieu, of, shoes, the, two, athletes, were, subsequently, expelled, from, the, games, by, the, ioc, v, ra, slavsk, in, protest, against, the, 1968, soviet, led, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, and, the, controversial, decision, by, the, judges, on, the, balance, beam, and, floor, turned, her, head, down, and, away, from, the, soviet, flag, while, the, national, anthem, was, played, during, the, medal, ceremony, she, returned, home, as, a, heroine, of, the, czechoslovak, people, but, was, made, an, outcast, by, the, soviet, dominated, government, politics, again, intervened, at, the, 1972, games, in, munich, but, this, time, with, lethal, consequences, a, palestinian, terrorist, group, named, black, september, invaded, the, olympic, village, and, broke, into, the, apartment, of, the, israeli, delegation, they, killed, two, israelis, and, held, nine, others, as, hostages, demanding, that, israel, release, numerous, prisoners, when, the, israeli, government, refused, the, terrorists, demands, the, situation, developed, into, a, tense, stand, off, while, negotiations, continued, eventually, the, captors, still, holding, their, hostages, were, offered, safe, passage, and, taken, to, an, airport, where, they, were, ambushed, by, german, security, forces, in, the, ensuing, firefight, 15, people, were, killed, including, the, nine, captive, israeli, athletes, and, five, of, the, terrorists, after, much, debate, the, decision, was, taken, to, continue, the, games, but, the, proceedings, were, understandably, dominated, by, these, events, some, memorable, athletic, achievements, did, occur, during, these, games, notably, the, winning, of, a, then, record, seven, gold, medals, by, united, states, swimmer, mark, spitz, finland, s, lasse, vir, n, taking, back, to, back, gold, medals, in, the, 5, 000, meters, and, 10, 000, meters, and, the, winning, of, three, gold, medals, by, soviet, gymnastic, star, olga, korbut, who, achieved, a, historic, backflip, off, the, high, bar, in, the, final, of, the, men, s, basketball, the, united, states, lost, to, the, soviet, union, in, what, is, widely, considered, as, the, most, controversial, game, in, international, basketball, history, in, a, close, fought, match, the, u, s, team, appeared, to, have, won, by, a, score, of, 50, 49, however, the, final, three, seconds, of, the, game, were, replayed, three, times, by, judges, until, the, soviet, team, came, out, on, top, and, claimed, a, 51, 50, victory, ultimately, the, u, s, team, refused, to, accept, their, silver, medals, there, was, no, such, tragedy, at, the, 1976, montreal, games, but, bad, planning, and, fraud, led, to, the, cost, of, these, games, far, exceeding, the, budget, costing, 1, 5, billion, equivalent, to, 7, 58, billion, in, 2023, the, 1976, summer, games, were, the, most, expensive, in, olympic, history, until, the, 2014, winter, olympics, and, it, seemed, for, a, time, that, the, olympics, might, no, longer, be, a, viable, financial, proposition, in, retrospect, it, is, believed, that, contractors, suspected, of, being, members, of, the, montreal, mafia, skimmed, large, sums, of, money, from, all, levels, of, contracts, while, also, profiting, from, the, substitution, of, cheaper, building, materials, of, lesser, quality, which, may, have, contributed, to, the, delays, poor, construction, and, excessive, costs, in, 1988, one, such, contractor, giuseppe, zappia, was, cleared, of, fraud, charges, that, resulted, from, his, work, on, olympic, facilities, after, two, key, witnesses, died, before, testifying, at, his, trial, the, 1976, games, were, boycotted, by, many, african, nations, as, a, protest, against, a, recent, tour, of, apartheid, run, south, africa, by, the, new, zealand, national, rugby, union, team, romanian, gymnast, nadia, com, neci, made, history, when, she, won, the, women, s, individual, all, around, gold, medal, with, two, of, four, possible, perfect, scores, she, won, two, other, individual, events, with, two, perfect, scores, in, the, balance, beam, and, all, perfect, scores, in, the, uneven, bars, lasse, vir, n, repeated, his, double, gold, in, the, 5, 000, and, 10, 000, meters, making, him, the, first, athlete, to, ever, win, the, distance, double, twice, following, the, soviet, union, s, 1979, invasion, of, afghanistan, 66, nations, including, the, united, states, canada, west, germany, and, japan, boycotted, the, 1980, games, held, in, moscow, eighty, nations, were, represented, at, the, moscow, games, the, smallest, number, since, 1956, the, boycott, contributed, to, the, 1980, games, being, a, less, publicised, and, less, competitive, affair, which, was, dominated, by, the, host, country, according, to, british, journalist, andrew, jennings, a, kgb, colonel, stated, that, the, agency, s, officers, had, posed, as, anti, doping, authorities, from, the, ioc, to, undermine, doping, tests, and, that, soviet, athletes, were, rescued, with, tremendous, efforts, on, the, topic, of, the, 1980, summer, olympics, a, 1989, australian, study, said, there, is, hardly, a, medal, winner, at, the, moscow, games, certainly, not, a, gold, medal, winner, who, is, not, on, one, sort, of, drug, or, another, usually, several, kinds, the, moscow, games, might, as, well, have, been, called, the, chemists, games, documents, obtained, in, 2016, revealed, the, soviet, union, s, plans, for, a, statewide, doping, system, in, track, and, field, in, preparation, for, the, 1984, summer, olympics, in, los, angeles, dated, prior, to, the, country, s, decision, to, boycott, the, games, the, document, detailed, the, existing, steroids, operations, of, the, programme, along, with,
