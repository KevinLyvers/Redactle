the, participation, of, women, and, girls, in, sports, physical, fitness, and, exercise, has, existed, throughout, history, however, participation, rates, and, activities, vary, in, accordance, with, nation, era, geography, and, stage, of, economic, development, the, modern, era, of, organized, sports, did, not, begin, to, emerge, either, for, women, or, men, until, the, late, industrial, age, until, roughly, 1870, women, s, activities, tended, to, be, informal, and, recreational, in, nature, lacked, rules, codes, and, emphasized, physical, activity, rather, than, competition, today, women, s, sports, are, more, sport, specific, and, have, developed, into, both, amateur, levels, and, professional, levels, in, various, places, internationally, but, is, found, primarily, within, developed, countries, where, conscious, organization, and, accumulation, of, wealth, has, occurred, in, the, mid, to, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, female, participation, in, sport, and, the, popularization, of, their, involvement, increased, particularly, during, its, last, quarter, very, few, organized, sports, have, been, invented, by, women, sports, such, as, newcomb, ball, netball, acrobatic, gymnastics, and, tumbling, and, possibly, stoolball, are, examples, women, s, involvement, in, sports, is, more, visible, in, well, developed, countries, and, today, their, level, of, participation, and, performance, still, varies, greatly, by, country, and, by, sport, despite, an, increase, in, women, s, participation, in, sport, the, male, demographic, is, still, the, larger, of, the, two, these, demographic, differences, are, observed, globally, female, dominated, sports, are, the, one, exception, girls, participation, in, sports, tend, to, be, higher, in, the, united, states, than, in, other, parts, of, the, world, like, western, europe, and, latin, america, girls, participation, in, more, violent, contact, sports, is, far, less, than, that, of, their, male, counterparts, two, important, divisions, exist, in, relation, to, female, sporting, categories, these, sports, either, emerged, exclusively, as, an, organized, female, sport, or, were, developed, as, an, organized, female, variant, of, a, sport, first, popularized, by, a, male, demographic, and, therefore, became, a, female, category, in, all, but, a, few, exceptional, cases, such, as, in, the, case, of, camogie, a, female, variant, or, women, s, game, uses, the, same, name, of, the, sport, popularly, played, by, men, but, is, classified, into, a, different, category, which, is, differentiated, by, sex, men, s, or, women, s, or, girls, or, boys, female, variants, are, widely, common, while, organized, female, sports, by, comparison, are, rare, and, include, team, sports, such, as, netball, throwball, artistic, n, e, synchronized, swimming, and, ringette, in, female, sports, the, supposed, benefits, of, gender, parity, gender, equity, and, gender, equality, feminism, are, controversial, except, in, a, few, rare, cases, like, women, s, professional, tennis, professional, women, s, sport, rarely, provide, competitors, with, a, livable, income, in, addition, competing, for, media, coverage, of, the, women, s, variant, of, a, sport, which, is, primarily, popular, among, males, creates, complex, barriers, more, recently, there, has, been, an, increasing, amount, of, interest, research, investment, and, production, in, regards, to, equipment, design, for, female, athletes, interest, and, research, involving, the, identification, of, sex, specific, injuries, particularly, though, not, exclusively, among, high, performance, female, athletes, has, increased, as, well, such, as, in, the, case, of, concussions, and, the, female, athlete, triad, a, k, a, relative, energy, deficiency, in, sport, red, s, at, times, female, athletes, have, engaged, in, social, activism, in, conjunction, with, their, participation, in, sport, protest, methods, have, included, playing, strikes, social, media, campaigns, and, in, the, case, of, america, federal, lawsuits, on, grounds, of, inequality, usually, as, it, relates, to, gender, parity, principles, american, law, and, title, ix, which, demand, schools, that, any, funds, given, to, support, students, sports, should, be, equally, distributed, between, boys, and, girls, public, service, oriented, promotional, campaigns, for, girls, in, sport, involve, a, variety, of, media, campaign, styles, before, each, ancient, olympic, games, a, separate, women, s, athletic, event, was, held, at, the, stadium, in, olympia, called, the, heraean, games, and, was, dedicated, to, the, goddess, hera, in, ancient, greek, mythology, there, was, the, belief, that, heraea, was, founded, by, hippodameia, the, wife, of, the, king, who, founded, the, olympics, according, to, e, norman, gardiner, at, the, festival, there, were, races, for, maidens, of, various, ages, their, course, was, 500, feet, or,

breast, the, victors, received, crowns, of, olive, and, a, share, of, the, heifer, sacrificed, to, hera, they, had, too, the, right, of, setting, up, their, statues, in, the, heraeum, although, married, women, were, excluded, from, the, olympics, even, as, spectators, cynisca, won, an, olympic, game, as, owner, of, a, chariot, champions, of, chariot, races, were, owners, not, riders, as, did, euryleonis, belistiche, zeuxo, encrateia, and, hermione, timarete, theodota, and, kassia, after, the, classical, period, there, was, some, participation, by, women, in, men, s, athletic, festivals, women, in, sparta, began, to, practice, the, same, athletic, exercises, that, men, did, exhibiting, the, qualities, of, spartan, soldiers, plato, even, supported, women, in, sports, by, advocating, running, and, sword, fighting, for, women, notably, cultural, representations, of, a, pronounced, female, physicality, were, not, limited, to, sport, in, ancient, greece, and, can, also, be, found, in, representations, of, a, group, of, warrioresses, known, as, the, amazons, in, book, six, of, the, odyssey, nausicaa, and, her, handmaidens, engage, in, light, sport, as, they, re, waiting, for, the, clothes, they, ve, washed, to, dry, during, the, song, yuan, and, ming, dynasties, women, played, in, professional, cuju, teams, cuju, also, known, as, tsu, chu, was, an, ancient, chinese, ball, game, that, is, considered, to, be, the, predecessor, of, modern, day, football, soccer, the, sport, of, cuju, reached, climax, in, song, dynasty, and, was, one, of, the, most, popular, sports, in, chinese, society, during, that, time, it, was, first, recorded, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, was, played, by, both, men, and, women, women, s, cuju, was, different, from, men, s, cuju, in, a, few, ways, first, the, women, s, ball, was, smaller, and, lighter, second, the, women, played, with, smaller, teams, and, on, a, smaller, field, third, the, women, were, not, allowed, to, use, their, hands, or, feet, to, touch, the, ball, instead, they, used, their, heads, and, chests, to, control, the, ball, women, s, cuju, was, a, popular, sport, for, centuries, in, china, it, was, played, by, women, of, all, social, classes, and, ages, the, game, was, often, played, during, festivals, and, holidays, the, educational, committees, of, the, french, revolution, 1789, included, intellectual, moral, and, physical, education, for, both, girls, and, boys, with, the, victory, of, napoleon, less, than, twenty, years, later, physical, education, was, reduced, to, military, preparedness, for, boys, and, men, in, germany, the, physical, education, of, gutsmuths, 1793, included, girl, s, education, this, included, the, measurement, of, performances, of, girls, this, led, to, women, s, sport, being, more, actively, pursued, in, germany, than, in, most, other, countries, when, the, f, d, ration, sportive, f, minine, internationale, was, formed, as, an, all, women, s, international, organization, it, had, a, german, male, vice, president, in, addition, to, german, international, success, in, elite, sports, few, women, competed, in, sports, in, europe, and, north, america, before, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, although, women, were, technically, permitted, to, participate, in, many, sports, relatively, few, did, those, who, did, participate, often, faced, disapproval, early, women, s, professional, sports, leagues, during, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, foundered, these, women, s, sports, were, more, focused, on, fitness, beauty, weight, and, health, women, s, sports, in, the, late, 1800s, focused, on, correct, posture, facial, and, bodily, beauty, muscles, and, health, prior, to, 1870, activities, for, women, were, recreational, rather, than, sport, specific, in, nature, and, emphasized, physical, activity, rather, than, competition, sports, for, women, before, the, 20th, century, placed, more, emphasis, on, fitness, rather, than, the, competitive, aspects, we, now, associate, with, organized, sports, in, 1916, the, amateur, athletic, union, aau, held, its, first, national, championship, for, women, in, swimming, in, 1923, the, aau, also, sponsored, the, first, american, track, field, championships, for, women, earlier, that, year, the, women, s, amateur, athletic, association, waaa, held, the, first, waaa, championships, bicycling, became, a, popular, activity, among, women, in, the, suffragette, era, bicycling, has, done, more, to, emancipate, women, than, anything, else, in, the, world, susan, b, anthony, said, i, stand, and, rejoice, every, time, i, see, a, woman, ride, on, a, wheel, it, gives, women, a, feeling, of, freedom, and, self, reliance, the, first, olympic, games, in, the, modern, era, in, 1896, were, not, open, to, women, since, then, the, number, of, women, who, have, participated, in, the, olympic, games, have, increased, substantially, many, girls, and, women, had, lots, of, opportunities, to, join, the, olympics, the, modern, olympics, had, female, competitors, from, 1900, onward, though, women, at, first, participated, in, considerably, fewer, events, than, men, women, first, made, their, appearance, in, the, olympic, games, in, paris, in, 1900, that, year, 22, women, competed, in, tennis, sailing, croquet, equestrian, and, golf, the, international, olympic, committee, founder, pierre, de, coubertin, described, women, s, sports, impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic, and, we, are, not, afraid, to, add, incorrect, however, the, 6th, ioc, congress, in, paris, 1914, decided, that, a, woman, s, medal, had, formally, the, same, weight, as, a, man, s, in, the, official, medal, table, this, left, the, decisions, about, women, s, participation, to, the, individual, international, sports, federations, concern, over, the, physical, strength, and, stamina, of, women, led, to, the, discouragement, of, female, participation, in, more, physically, strenuous, sports, in, response, to, the, lack, of, support, for, women, s, international, sport, the, f, d, ration, sportive, f, minine, internationale, was, founded, in, france, by, alice, milliat, this, organization, initiated, the, women, s, olympiad, held, 1921, 1922, and, 1923, and, the, women, s, world, games, which, attracted, participation, of, nearly, 20, countries, and, was, held, four, times, 1922, 1926, 1930, and, 1934, in, 1924, the, 1924, women, s, olympiad, was, held, at, stamford, bridge, in, london, the, international, olympic, committee, began, to, incorporate, greater, participation, of, women, at, the, olympics, in, response, the, number, of, olympic, women, athletes, increased, over, five, fold, in, the, period, going, from, 65, at, the, 1920, summer, olympics, to, 331, at, the, 1936, summer, olympics, amateur, competitions, became, the, primary, venue, for, women, s, sports, throughout, the, mid, twentieth, century, communist, countries, dominated, many, olympic, sports, including, women, s, sports, due, to, state, sponsored, athletic, programs, that, were, technically, regarded, as, amateur, the, legacy, of, these, programs, endured, as, former, communist, countries, continue, to, produce, many, of, the, top, female, athletes, germany, and, scandinavia, also, developed, strong, women, s, athletic, programs, in, this, period, in, 1972, the, united, states, congress, passed, the, title, ix, legislation, as, a, part, of, the, additional, amendment, act, to, the, 1964, civil, rights, act, title, ix, states, that, no, person, shall, on, the, basis, of, sex, be, excluded, from, participating, in, be, denied, benefits, of, or, be, subjected, to, discrimination, under, any, educational, programs, or, activities, receiving, federal, financial, assistance, title, ix, prohibits, discrimination, based, on, sex, in, schools, receiving, federal, funds, through, grants, scholarships, or, other, support, for, students, the, law, states, that, federal, funds, can, be, withdrawn, from, a, school, engaging, in, intentional, sex, based, discrimination, in, the, provision, of, curriculum, counseling, academic, support, or, general, educational, opportunities, contrary, to, popular, belief, title, ix, initially, had, nothing, to, do, with, sports, and, would, not, include, interscholastic, or, varsity, sports, until, later, today, the, law, from, the, education, act, requires, that, both, male, and, female, athletes, have, equal, facilities, and, equal, benefits, the, equal, benefits, are, considered, necessities, such, as, equal, equipment, uniforms, supplies, training, practice, quality, in, coaches, and, opponents, awards, cheerleaders, and, bands, at, the, game, important, changes, regarding, athletics, and, sport, occurred, in, 1975, in, 1975, the, department, of, health, education, and, welfare, s, office, for, civil, rights, ocr, published, a, title, ix, regulation, that, required, institutions, sponsoring, athletic, programs, to, provide, equal, athletic, opportunities, for, students, by, accommodating, both, sexes, athletic, interests, and, abilities, in, 1979, there, was, a, policy, interpretation, that, offered, three, ways, in, which, schools, could, be, compliant, with, title, ix, in, regards, to, athletics, and, sport, it, became, known, as, the, three, part, test, schools, only, have, to, be, compliant, with, one, of, the, three, prongs, a, 1999, study, by, sigelman, and, wahlbeck, found, many, schools, were, nowhere, near, compliance, many, schools, attempt, to, achieve, compliance, through, the, first, prong, however, in, order, to, achieve, that, compliance, schools, cut, men, s, programs, which, is, not, the, way, the, ocr, wanted, compliance, achieved, equity, is, not, the, only, way, to, be, compliant, with, title, ix, athletic, departments, need, to, show, that, they, are, making, efforts, to, achieve, parity, in, participation, treatment, and, athletic, financial, assistance, according, to, research, done, by, the, national, women, s, law, center, in, 2011, 4500, public, high, schools, across, the, nation, exhibited, high, rates, of, gender, inequality, and, were, considered, to, be, in, violation, of, the, title, ix, laws, further, research, done, by, the, women, s, law, center, in, 2017, found, schools, with, a, high, number, of, minority, students, and, a, higher, number, of, people, of, color, mainly, found, in, the, southern, american, states, had, a, much, higher, rate, of, gender, disparity, a, large, disparity, gap, regarding, sport, related, scholarships, for, women, and, men, with, men, getting, 190, million, more, in, funding, than, women, was, also, found, despite, an, increase, in, participation, in, sports, by, girls, and, women, this, pattern, persists, most, colleges, focus, on, their, male, athletics, teams, and, invest, more, money, into, those, already, successful, programs, this, disparity, is, presented, by, some, feminist, ideologues, as, a, phenomenon, illustrating, a, cause, and, effect, link, between, race, and, gender, and, how, it, plays, a, significant, role, in, the, hierarchy, of, sports, it, is, widely, believed, that, title, ix, has, had, a, positive, effect, on, women, s, sports, in, america, and, aided, their, participation, american, female, athletes, now, have, grounds, to, help, support, the, stance, that, women, athletes, deserve, a, higher, level, of, respect, and, consideration, that, is, necessary, in, order, for, their, participation, women, s, involvement, in, sports, has, helped, raise, the, recognition, of, their, sports, programs, and, competitive, athletes, to, a, level, comparable, to, that, which, men, have, enjoyed, for, many, years, while, the, mandate, did, not, immediately, go, into, effect, it, had, been, publicized, to, such, an, extent, that, it, enabled, the, general, public, to, sense, its, future, implications, there, had, been, great, anticipation, for, the, bill, prior, to, its, passage, which, helped, it, gain, media, coverage, in, time, for, when, the, bill, was, mandated, to, be, followed, the, involvement, in, women, s, sports, spiked, after, title, ix, was, put, into, place, mostly, in, high, school, level, sports, as, well, as, collegiate, title, ix, s, effect, on, women, in, sport, was, observed, to, have, far, reaching, implications, that, were, not, restricted, to, those, who, were, participating, in, a, professional, or, intermediate, way, girls, and, women, who, did, not, see, themselves, in, a, more, serious, athlete, light, felt, increasingly, empowered, to, participate, and, compete, the, bill, allowed, for, the, equal, treatment, of, female, athletes, to, become, a, part, of, the, larger, sports, institution, and, culture, and, is, considered, to, have, played, an, important, role, in, increasing, the, popular, view, in, america, that, female, participation, and, competition, in, sport, was, a, valid, part, of, society, and, life, although, a, lot, has, changed, since, the, implementation, of, title, ix, high, school, girls, still, remain, to, have, less, access, to, sports, opportunities, than, males, did, in, 1972, on, a, college, basis, as, well, female, athletes, are, receiving, significantly, lower, amounts, in, athletic, scholarships, compared, to, their, male, counterparts, with, a, notable, gap, of, 252, million, title, ix, is, american, law, the, purpose, of, the, title, ix, of, the, educational, amendments, of, 1972, was, to, update, title, vii, of, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, which, banned, several, forms, of, discrimination, in, employment, but, did, not, address, or, mention, discrimination, in, education, contrary, to, popular, belief, the, creation, of, title, ix, had, nothing, to, do, with, sports, women, s, sports, were, not, considered, a, relevant, issue, within, educational, organizations, at, the, time, it, was, not, until, later, that, title, ix, involved, a, new, objective, to, ensure, equal, treatment, in, organized, sports, and, schools, regardless, of, sex, in, a, federally, funded, program, however, title, ix, is, most, commonly, associated, with, its, impact, on, american, athletics, and, more, specifically, the, impact, it, has, had, on, women, s, participation, in, athletics, at, every, age, since, title, ix, became, law, records, have, illustrated, an, increasing, number, of, opportunities, in, american, educational, institutions, in, a, variety, of, sports, for, women, and, girls, as, of, the, 2007, 2008, school, year, females, made, up, 41, of, the, participants, in, college, athletics, in, 1971, 1972, there, were, 294, 015, females, participating, in, high, school, athletics, and, in, 2007, 2008, there, were, over, three, million, females, participating, a, 940, increase, in, female, participation, in, high, school, athletics, in, 1971, 1972, there, were, 29, 972, females, participating, in, college, athletics, and, in, 2007, 2008, there, were, 166, 728, females, participating, a, 456, increase, in, female, participation, in, college, athletics, in, 1971, less, than, 300, 000, females, played, in, high, school, sports, after, the, law, was, passed, many, females, started, to, get, involved, in, sports, by, 1990, eighteen, years, later, 1, 9, million, female, high, school, students, were, playing, sports, american, studies, have, investigated, whether, or, not, there, is, a, strong, correlation, between, female, participation, in, sport, and, positive, outcomes, in, women, s, education, and, employment, later, on, in, life, a, 2010, study, found, that, the, changes, set, in, motion, by, title, ix, explained, about, 20, percent, of, the, increase, in, women, s, education, and, about, 40, percent, of, the, rise, in, employment, for, 25, to, 34, year, old, women, this, is, not, to, say, that, all, women, who, are, successful, later, on, in, life, played, sports, but, it, is, saying, that, women, who, did, participate, in, athletics, received, benefits, in, their, education, and, employment, later, on, in, life, in, 1971, fewer, than, 295, 000, girls, participated, in, high, school, varsity, athletics, accounting, for, just, 7, percent, of, all, varsity, athletes, in, 2001, that, number, leaped, to, 2, 8, million, or, 41, 5, percent, of, all, varsity, athletes, according, to, the, national, coalition, for, women, and, girls, in, education, in, 1966, 16, 000, females, competed, in, intercollegiate, athletics, by, 2001, that, number, jumped, to, more, than, 150, 000, accounting, for, 43, percent, of, all, college, athletes, in, addition, a, 2008, study, of, intercollegiate, athletics, showed, that, women, s, collegiate, sports, had, grown, to, 9, 101, teams, or, 8, 65, per, school, the, five, most, frequently, offered, college, sports, for, women, in, america, are, in, order, 1, basketball, 98, 8, of, schools, have, a, team, 2, volleyball, 95, 7, 3, soccer, 92, 0, 4, cross, country, 90, 8, and, 5, softball, 89, 2, since, 1972, women, have, also, competed, in, the, traditional, male, sports, of, wrestling, weightlifting, rugby, and, boxing, an, article, in, the, new, york, times, reported, lasting, benefits, for, women, from, title, ix, citing, a, correlation, between, participation, in, sports, and, increased, educational, opportunities, as, well, as, employment, opportunities, for, girls, furthermore, the, athletic, participation, by, girls, and, women, spurred, by, title, ix, was, associated, with, lower, obesity, rates, while, other, public, health, program, failed, to, claim, similar, success, although, female, participation, in, sports, has, increased, due, to, title, ix, there, has, not, been, a, similar, effect, in, terms, of, women, holding, coaching, or, other, managerial, positions, in, sports, most, sport, teams, or, institutions, regardless, of, gender, are, managed, by, male, coaches, and, managers, for, example, according, to, 2016, data, 33, of, wnba, teams, are, led, by, women, coaches, or, managers, the, international, olympic, committee, also, consists, of, 20, female, members, the, data, presented, also, showed, that, 15, of, athletic, directors, in, colleges, nationwide, were, females, and, that, number, is, much, less, in, the, southern, states, there, are, various, reasons, that, have, been, suggested, to, account, for, this, trend, messner, and, bozada, deas, 2009, suggest, traditional, gender, roles, may, play, a, role, and, that, society, s, historical, division, of, labor, leads, to, men, volunteering, as, team, coaches, and, women, volunteering, as, team, moms, everhart, and, chelladurai, 1998, show, that, this, phenomenon, may, be, part, of, a, larger, cycle, girls, who, are, coached, by, men, growing, up, are, less, likely, to, view, themselves, as, coaches, when, they, are, adults, and, so, the, number, of, female, coaches, decreases, meaning, more, girls, are, coached, by, men, organized, sports, hold, a, high, priority, status, in, canadian, culture, the, growth, of, female, participation, in, sport, in, canada, has, historically, been, slower, than, that, among, males, one, notable, exception, is, the, female, sport, of, ringette, which, is, not, a, variant, of, a, popular, men, s, sport, and, whose, players, are, predominantly, female, different, arguments, exist, as, to, why, there, are, less, female, participants, in, sport, in, canada, and, what, factors, are, and, should, be, considered, most, relevant, in, most, cases, canadian, studies, involving, female, participation, in, sport, fail, to, involve, methodologies, that, account, for, and, make, observable, the, difference, between, participation, rates, in, exclusively, or, predominantly, female, sports, such, as, artistic, n, e, synchronized, swimming, and, ringette, in, comparison, to, sports, involving, male, and, female, categories, of, the, same, sport, such, as, basketball, popular, prejudice, against, sports, which, are, mainly, popular, among, females, is, often, exacerbated, by, gender, equity, feminists, whose, goal, it, is, to, portray, female, sports, excellence, as, merited, only, within, the, context, of, competition, with, men, as, a, result, sports, which, involve, both, a, male, and, female, category, are, viewed, as, legitimately, successful, due, to, the, manufactured, struggle, between, the, two, sexes, despite, the, reality, of, male, dominance, in, sport, due, to, natural, biological, assets, in, canada, the, majority, of, feminist, ideologues, in, sport, claim, slow, growth, in, participation, in, girls, and, women, s, sports, programs, with, male, and, female, categories, are, due, to, a, number, of, factors, while, both, girls, and, women, have, historically, had, low, levels, of, interest, and, participation, sports, feminists, in, canada, have, contended, that, these, differences, are, largely, due, to, patriarchy, and, the, fact, that, there, are, fewer, women, than, men, in, leadership, positions, in, academic, administration, student, affairs, athletics, and, coaching, in, canada, as, well, as, in, other, societies, worldwide, organized, sports, have, been, used, and, viewed, as, a, traditional, way, to, demonstrate, and, develop, masculinity, with, an, increasing, number, of, girls, and, women, with, a, serious, interest, in, sports, the, cross, cultural, divide, between, the, sexes, began, to, narrow, with, the, male, sports, establishment, becoming, actively, hostile, during, the, 1960s, with, the, arrival, of, second, wave, feminism, a, number, of, feminists, dismissed, female, sports, and, thought, of, them, as, an, unworthy, cause, and, one, in, no, need, of, their, support, among, other, feminists, women, s, progress, in, sport, involved, the, belief, that, their, needed, to, be, an, effort, to, counter, a, common, and, unfounded, notion, that, vigorous, physical, activity, was, dangerous, for, women, these, notions, where, first, challenged, around, 1900, these, women, called, new, women, started, with, bicycling, by, the, 1920s, a, marked, change, for, women, occurred, involving, young, working, class, women, in, addition, to, the, pioneering, middle,

the, case, of, concussions, concern, also, involves, consequences, to, women, during, pregnancy, historically, regional, differences, in, canada, are, recorded, to, have, existed, in, regards, to, codified, rules, in, sport, involving, male, and, female, programs, one, such, example, involves, the, eastern, provinces, of, canada, which, for, a, time, included, a, different, game, code, for, the, female, category, of, basketball, while, the, western, provinces, opted, for, a, simplified, identical, rules, structure, in, relation, to, both, sexes, this, disparity, is, claimed, as,

showcase, league, instead, ringette, was, created, exclusively, for, females, in, canada, in, 1963, and, excluded, male, athletes, as, a, result, the, elite, level, of, the, sport, consists, entirely, of, players, who, are, women, because, the, sport, has, developed, a, female, category, and, a, male, category, does, not, exist, the, league, has, no, opportunity, to, form, a, partnership, with, a,

in, latin, america, fostering, a, future, where, gender, equity, and, athletic, excellence, go, hand, in, hand, in, october, 2017, the, irish, rugby, football, union, irfu, advertised, an, available, position, for, head, coach, of, the, irish, women, s, national, rugby, team, the, job, was, advertised, as, part, time, casual, and, available, on, six, month, basis, players, expressed, their, disagreement, with, the, decision, believing, it, was, a, sign, that, the, irfu, was, disrespecting, and, not, prioritizing, the, women, s, game, in, response, to, this, announcement, the, players, highlighted, what, they, perceived, as, the, irfu, s, lack, of, commitment, to, the, long, term, development, of, the, women, s, game, by, wearing, bracelets, with, legacy, written, on, them, for, games, with, their, club, teams, in, the, all, ireland, league, the, jamaican, women, s, national, soccer, team, nicknamed, the, reggae, girlz, participated, in, the, 2019, fifa, women, s, world, cup, this, was, the, first, women, s, world, cup, the, country, had, qualified, for, and, the, country, was, also, the, first, caribbean, country, to, ever, qualify, however, in, september, 2019, members, of, the, team, including, khadija, shaw, and, allyson, swaby, posted, a, graphic, on, instagram, with, captions, stating, that, they, had, not, been, paid, by, the, jamaica, football, federation, jff, for, nine, months, of, work, they, announced, that, the, team, would, not, participate, in, any, future, tournaments, until, they, received, payment, jff, president, michael, ricketts, later, announced, that, the, team, would, be, paid, by, the, end, of, september, in, october, 2019, the, reggae, girlz, began, playing, again, and, they, won, their, group, in, the, qualification, tournament, for, the, 2020, concacaf, women, s, olympic, qualifying, competition, the, jamaican, national, netball, team, nicknamed, the, sunshine, girls, is, ranked, fourth, in, the, world, as, of, july, 2019, however, the, team, has, not, been, well, funded, and, had, to, resort, to, crowdfunding, to, attend, the, 2019, netball, world, cup, after, receiving, support, from, sponsors, the, sunshine, girls, were, able, to, go, to, the, tournament, where, they, placed, fifth, overall, muslim, women, are, less, likely, to, take, part, in, sport, than, western, non, muslims, this, is, particularly, so, for, women, in, arab, societies, the, traditions, of, islamic, modesty, in, dress, and, requirements, for, women, s, sport, to, take, place, in, a, single, sex, environment, make, sports, participation, more, difficult, for, devout, female, adherents, the, lack, of, availability, of, suitably, modest, sports, clothing, and, sports, facilities, that, allow, women, to, play, in, private, contributes, to, the, lack, of, participation, cultural, norms, of, women, s, roles, and, responsibilities, towards, the, family, may, also, be, a, source, of, discouragement, from, time, consuming, sports, practice, islamic, tenets, and, religious, texts, suggest, that, women, s, sports, in, general, should, be, promoted, and, are, not, against, the, values, of, the, religion, the,

occasions, with, aisha, beating, him, the, first, couple, of, times, correspondingly, some, scholars, have, proposed, that, muslim, women, s, lack, of, engagement, with, sport, is, due, to, cultural, or, societal, reasons, rather, than, strictly, religious, ones, however, besides, religious, testaments, there, are, many, barriers, for, muslim, women, in, relation, to, sports, participation, a, significant, barrier, to, muslim, women, s, sports, participation, is, bans, on, the, islamic, headscarf, commonly, known, as, the, hijab, fifa, instituted, such, a, ban, in, 2011, preventing, the, iranian, women, s, national, football, team, from, competing, they, have, since, repealed, the, ban, but, other, organizations, including, fiba, maintain, such, regulations, at, the, same, time, many, muslim, female, athletes, have, achieved, significant, success, in, athletic, competitions, some, have, also, used, sports, towards, their, own, empowerment, working, for, women, s, rights, education, and, health, and, wellbeing, iranian, women, were, banned, from, attending, a, volleyball, game, and, an, iranian, girl, was, arrested, for, attending, a, match, iran, was, given, the, right, to,

in, iran, in, october, 2018, iran, announced, that, after, 40, years, it, would, allow, women, to, enter, sport, arenas, on, september, 22, 2019, the, iranian, authorities, assured, fifa, that, women,

upon, two, driving, assumptions, the, theory, of, patriarchy, as, fact, in, every, case, and, the, belief, that, participation, in, sport, by, females, should, also, serve, a, type, of, feminist,

had, a, greater, number, of, articles, than, women, s, sports, in, a, ratio, of, 23, 1, in, 1990, a, study, was, conducted, that, recorded, and, compared, the, amount, of, media, coverage, of, women, s, and, men, s, sports, on, popular, newspapers, they, analyzed, four, different, sports, magazines, for, three, months, and, recorded, the, number, of, women, s, sports, stories, that, were, featured, and, the, content, of, the, stories, women, s, sports, made, up, 3, 5, compared, to, the, 81, of, men, s, coverage, the, lengths, of, these, articles, were, 25, 27, shorter, than, the, length, of, men, s, articles, there, was, an, international, frenzy, in, 2012, when, the, first, woman, that, represented, saudi, arabia, in, the, 2012, olympics, competed, in, track, that, was, the, most, women, s, sports, coverage, that, there, had, been, in, several, years, women, played, 90, minutes, of, football, 80, minutes, of, rugby, 18, holes, of, golf, and, ran, the, same, distance, in, a, marathon, as, men, exactly, 12, months, later, the, newspapers, returned, to, featuring, 4, of, articles, on, women, s, sports, this, same, trend, can, be, seen, with, regards, to, the, fifa, world, cup, the, 2015, women, s, world, cup, final, had, an, average, of, 25, 4, million, american, viewers, throughout, the, duration, of, the, match, and, peaked, at, 30, 9, million, viewers, it, was, the, most, viewed, game, of, soccer, ever, in, the, united, states, men, s, or, women, s, by, a, margin, of, almost, 7, million, viewers, despite, this, jump, in, viewership, of, women, s, soccer, in, the, u, s, television, broadcasting, of, the, women, s, professional, soccer, league, in, the, u, s, remained, much, lower, than, that, of, the, men, s, league, fox, sports, network, the, company, that, owns, the, rights, to, broadcast, the, national, women, s, soccer, league, broadcast, 3, regular, season, nwsl, games, and, 34, major, league, soccer, regular, season, games, during, the, 2016, seasons, the, dearth, of, coverage, of, women, s, sports, is, evidenced, by, the, low, number, of, segments, i, e, stories, in, our, sample, of, the, 934, local, network, affiliate, news, segments, over, 12, hr, of, broadcasts, 880, were, on, men, s, sports, or, approximately, 11, hr, 22, segments, or, nearly, 18, min, were, on, gender, neutral, sports, e, g, a, horse, race, coverage, of, the, los, angeles, marathon, and, a, recreational, sports, event, and, only, 32, segments, about, 23, min, featured, women, s, sports, sportscenter, s, numbers, were, similar, of, the, 405, total, sportscenter, segments, in, our, sample, nearly, 14, hr, 376, covered, men, s, sports, slightly, over, 13, hr, 16, segments, were, on, gender, neutral, sports, just, over, 20, min, and, only, 13, segments, featured, women, s, sports, approximately, 17, min, a, recent, article, from, the, wall, street, journal, states, from, 2016, to, 2018, women, s, games, generated, about, 50, 8, million, in, revenue, compared, with, 49, 9, million, for, the, men, according, to, u, s, soccer, s, audited, financial, statements, bachman, 2019, these, numbers, contrasts, the, idea, that, women, s, sports, are, not, entertaining, enough, for, the, viewer, or, typical, fan, by, 1, 9, million, this, idea, stems, from, the, male, dominated, sports, perspective, which, constantly, undermines, the, perception, of, quality, effort, and, potential, that, women, s, soccer, exhibits, however, we, can, see, through, the, caliber, of, women, s, soccer, displayed, most, recently, within, the, women, s, fifa, world, cup, of, 2019, that, it, was, on, par, if, not, better, than, the, level, of, play, of, their, male, counterparts, the, u, s, women, s, national, team, scored, 13, goals, against, thailand, in, their, opening, match, the, most, goals, scored, in, any, world, cup, match, in, history, media, outlets, though, may, remain, concerned, that, increased, coverage, of, women, s, sport, will, lead, to, a, reduction, in, audience, draw, and, advertising, revenue, amy, godoy, pressland, conducted, a, study, that, investigated, the, relationship, between, sports, reporting, and, gender, in, great, britain, she, studied, great, britain, s, newspapers, from, january, 2008, to, december, 2009, and, documented, how, media, coverage, of, men, s, sports, and, women, s, sports, was, fairly, equal, during, the, olympics, and, then, altered, after, the, olympics, were, over, sportswomen, are, disproportionately, under, represented, and, the, sheer, quantity, and, quality, of, news, items, on, sportsmen, demonstrates, how, male, athletes, are, represented, as, dominant, and, superior, to, females, she, also, documented, how, women, s, bodies, were, sexualized, in, photographs, and, written, coverage, noting, that, the, women, featured, were, either, nude, semi, nude, or, wearing, revealing, clothing, the, sexualization, of, sportswomen, in, sunday, reporting, is, commonplace, and, aimed, at, the, mostly, male, readership, it, promotes, the, idea, of, female, aesthetics, over, achievements, while, the, coverage, of, women, not, directly, involved, in, sport, misrepresents, the, place, of, women, in, sport, and, inferiorizes, real, sportswomen, s, achievements, the, media, has, the, ability, to, create, or, prevent, interest, in, women, s, sports, excluding, women, s, sports, from, the, media, makes, it, much, less, likely, for, young, girls, to, have, role, models, that, are, women, athletes, according, to, tucker, center, for, research, on, girls, women, in, sport, at, the, university, of, minnesota, 40, of, all, athletes, in, the, united, states, are, women, but, women, s, sports, only, receive, about, 4, of, sports, media, coverage, this, amount, of, coverage, has, decreased, in, the, last, 20, years, although, there, has, been, a, major, increase, in, women, athletes, media, coverage, has, slightly, increased, and, this, is, mostly, due, to, social, networking, social, media, has, further, exposed, women, sports, out, to, the, public, world, and, often, at, a, much, greater, rate, than, traditional, news, media, traditional, media, has, also, improved, its, coverage, of, women, s, sports, through, more, exposure, time, and, using, better, equipment, to, record, the, events, recent, research, has, shown, that, in, the, past, twenty, years, camera, angles, slow, motion, replays, quality, and, graphics, regarding, the, presentation, of, women, sports, has, gradually, improved, however, mainstream, media, still, is, far, behind, in, its, showcasing, of, female, sports, in, comparison, to, that, of, men, s, a, study, has, shown, that, espn, which, began, airing, women, ncaa, tournament, in, 2003, aired, eleven, women, tournament, segments, in, comparison, to, one, hundred, men, s, tournament, segments, espn, and, other, sports, outlets, are, airing, more, female, oriented, sporting, events, however, the, length, of, the, segments, are, very, small, this, representative, data, is, showcases, a, main, part, of, the, minimal, interaction, the, media, has, with, women, athletes, media, coverage, of, women, sports, in, the, united, states, has, further, justified, the, divisional, hierarchy, faced, by, women, athletes, in, terms, of, popularity, and, coverage, scholarly, studies, kane, m, j, lavoi, n, m, fink, j, s, 2013, also, show, that, when, women, athletes, were, given, the, option, to, pick, a, photo, of, a, picture, that, would, increase, respect, for, their, sport, they, picked, an, on, the, court, competency, picture, however, when, women, athletes, were, told, to, pick, a, picture, that, would, increase, interest, in, their, sport, 47, picked, a, picture, that, sexualized, the, women, athlete, the, uk, is, more, representative, than, the, united, states, with, the, bbc, giving, women, s, sports, about, 20, of, their, sports, coverage, bbc, spokesperson, many, women, athletes, in, the, uk, do, not, see, this, as, adequate, coverage, for, the, 36, of, women, who, participate, in, sports, newschain, is, the, first, commercial, publisher, totally, dedicated, to, women, s, sport, coverage, based, in, the, uk, it, is, shown, that, only, 5, percent, of, sports, coverage, on, sports, center, is, of, women, sport, sports, equipment, designed, for, the, female, body, is, a, more, recent, development, in, women, s, and, girl, s, sport, historically, men, s, organized, sport, develops, first, often, leaving, girls, and, women, with, the, only, option, of, using, equipment, originally, designed, for, the, male, body, a, common, practice, to, this, day, over, time, these, practices, have, revealed, sports, equipment, can, present, design, issues, for, female, participants, particularly, for, those, whose, participation, continues, after, the, onset, of, puberty, typically, anatomical, differences, between, male, and, female, bodies, do, not, receive, first, consideration, during, the, first, stage, of, equipment, design, since, the, male, body, often, serves, as, the, base, model, due, to, the, predominance, of, male, participants, and, market, demand, women, and, girls, will, often, use, equipment, designed, for, smaller, men, or, even, boys, in, some, sports, these, differences, are, not, adversely, significant, but, can, be, so, in, the, case, of, others, sports, equipment, can, create, sizing, issues, for, girls, and, women, and, can, also, affect, performance, enjoyment, and, satisfaction, designers, can, also, fail, to, develop, equipment, made, to, protective, sensitive, areas, such, as, female, genitalia, and, the, chest, area, one, important, recent, development, is, the, sports, bra, commercially, available, sports, bras, first, came, to, market, in, the, 1970s, the, development, of, sports, bra, significantly, improves, the, performance, of, women, in, sports, activities, and, offers, several, benefits, that, contribute, to, a, more, comfortable, and, efficient, sports, experience, for, women, by, the, research, of, norris, etal, breast, movements, show, a, noticeable, drop, when, women, engage, in, sports, activities, wearing, sports, bra, and, a, more, stable, body, contributes, to, better, performance, in, sports, sports, bra, address, the, physical, needs, and, promote, body, acceptance, of, women, by, providing, support, compression, and, encapsulation, which, allows, women, to, exercise, comfortably, and, safely, and, symbols, women, s, participation, in, sports, and, their, right, to, engage, in, physical, activity, without, limitations, this, can, challenge, traditional, gender, stereotypes, and, contribute, to, a, more, inclusive, and, equitable, sporting, landscape, overall, the, design, of, sports, bras, is, more, than, just, a, piece, of, clothing, it, is, a, symbol, of, progress, empowerment, and, inclusivity, in, the, fight, for, gender, equality, in, sports, and, beyond, some, sports, require, female, players, wear, a, type, of, female, genital, protection, the, female, equivalent, of, the, male, jockstrap, is, the, pelvic, protector, essentially, a, jockstrap, for, females, known, colloquially, called, a, jill, or, jillstrap, there, are, some, common, sports, injuries, for, which, female, athletes, may, be, at, a, higher, risk, than, male, athletes, one, area, of, interest, involves, studying, the, female, athlete, triad, a, k, a, relative, energy, deficiency, in, sport, red, s, several, studies, have, shown, that, female, athletes, are, more, likely, to, tear, their, anterior, cruciate, ligaments, acls, than, male, athletes, according, to, william, levine, director, of, sports, medicine, at, columbia, university, and, the, head, physician, for, its, varsity, teams, female, athletes, are, four, or, five, times, more, likely, than, male, athletes, to, have, acl, tears, there, are, several, different, theories, about, why, women, are, more, prone, to, this, injury, including, the, q, theory, which, highlights, specific, differences, in, male, and, female, anatomy, and, kinesiology, the, difference, in, injury, risk, may, be, due, to, female, specific, hormonal, changes, associated, with, the, menstrual, cycle, or, due, to, different, skeletal, and, muscular, structures, like, a, wider, pelvis, stronger, quadriceps, than, hamstrings, or, more, elastic, ligaments, that, cause, women, to, place, more, stress, on, and, more, easily, stretch, the, acl, than, men, female, athletes, are, also, more, prone, to, concussions, than, male, athletes, they, exhibit, more, visible, symptoms, of, a, concussion, than, male, athletes, and, for, a, longer, period, of, time, than, male, athletes, a, phenomenon, known, as, the, concussion, gap, however, there, is, no, consensus, on, the, reason, women, are, more, prone, to, concussions, than, men, or, experience, symptoms, differently, some, theories, have, been, that, women, have, smaller, more, breakable, nerve, fibers, in, their, brains, that, their, necks, are, weaker, and, so, their, brains, accelerate, more, sharply, on, impact, or, fluctuating, hormones, during, menstrual, cycles, that, make, them, more, susceptible
