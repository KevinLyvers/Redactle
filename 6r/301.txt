board, the, achievement, of, this, while, the, opponent, is, still, a, long, way, behind, results, in, a, triple, win, known, as, a, backgammon, hence, the, name, of, the, game, backgammon, involves, a, combination, of, strategy, and, luck, from, rolling, dice, while, the, dice, may, determine, the, outcome, of, a, single, game, the, better, player, will, accumulate, the, better, record, over, a, series, of, many, games, with, each, roll, of, the, dice, players, must, choose, from, numerous, options, for, moving, their, pieces, and, anticipate, possible, counter, moves, by, the, opponent, the, optional, use, of, a, doubling, cube, allows, players, to, raise, the, stakes, during, the, game, the, earliest, specific, reference, to, backgammon, was, in, a, letter, dated, 1635, when, it, was, emerging, as, a, variant, of, the, popular, medieval, anglo, scottish, game, of, irish, the, latter, was, described, as, a, better, game, by, the, 19th, century, however, backgammon, had, spread, to,

different, tables, games, such, as, nard, or, nardy, are, better, known, backgammon, is, a, recent, member, of, the, large, family, of, tables, games, that, date, back, to, ancient, times, its, equipment, is, similar, or, identical, to, earlier, tables, games, that, have, been, depicted, for, centuries, in, art, leading, to, the, mistaken, belief, that, backgammon, itself, is, much, older, the, history, of, board, games, can, be, traced, back, nearly, 5, 000, years, to, archaeological, discoveries, of, the, jiroft, culture, located, in, present, day, iran, the, world, s, oldest, game,

game, of, 20, squares, and, irving, finkel, has, suggested, a, possible, reconstruction, the, royal, game, of, ur, from, 2600, bc, may, also, be, an, ancestor, or, intermediate, of, modern, day, table, games, like, backgammon, and, is, the, oldest, game, for, which, rules, have, been, handed, down, it, used, tetrahedral, dice, various, other, board, games, spanning, the, 10th, to, 7th, centuries, bc, have, been, found, throughout, modern, day, iraq, syria, egypt, and, western, iran, the, persian, tables, game, of, nard, or, nard, ir, emerged, somewhere, between, the, 3rd, and, 6th, century, ad, one, text, k, r, n, mag, ardax, r, p, pak, n, linking, it, with, ardashir, i, r, 224, 41, founder, of, the, sasanian, dynasty, whereas, another, wi, ri, n, atrang, ud, nihi, n, n, w,

meaning, table, or, board, is, described, in, an, epigram, of, byzantine, emperor, zeno, ad, 476, 491, the, overall, aim, was, to, be, first, to, bear, one, s, pieces, off, the, board, had, the, typical, tables, layout, with, 24, points, 12, on, each, side, and, there, were, 15, counters, per, player, however, unlike, modern, western, backgammon, there, were, three, cubical, dice, not, two, no, bar, nor, doubling, die, and, all, counters, started, off, the, board, modern, backgammon, follows, the, same, rules, as, tabula, for, hitting, a, blot, and, for, bearing, off, and, the, rules, for, re, entering, pieces, in, backgammon, are, the, same, as, those, for, initially, entering, pieces, in, tabula, the, name, tavli, is, still, used, in, greece, for, various, tables, games, which, are, frequently, played, in, town, plateias, and, cafes, the, of, emperor, zeno, s, time, is, believed, to, be, a, direct, descendant, of, the, earlier, roman, ludus, duodecim, scriptorum, game, of, twelve, lines, with, the, board, s, middle, row, of, points, removed, and, only, the, two, outer, rows, remaining, ludus, duodecim, scriptorum, used, a, board, with, three, rows, of, 12, points, each, with, the, 15, pieces, being, moved, in, opposing, directions, by, the, two, players, across, three, rows, according, to, the, roll, of, the, three, cubical, dice, little, specific, text, about, the, gameplay, of, ludus, duodecim, scriptorum, has, survived, it, may, have, been, related, to, the, older, ancient, greek, dice, game, kubeia, the, earliest, known, mention, of, the, game, is, in, ovid, s, ars, amatoria, the, art, of, love, written, between, 1, bc, and, 8, ad, in, roman, times, this, game, was, also, known, as, alea, tables, games, first, appeared, in, france, during, the, 11th,

translation, of, arabic, manuscripts, by, the, toledo, school, of, translators, irish, had, been, popular, at, the, scottish, court, of, james, iv, and, considered, to, be, the, more, serious, and, solid, game, when, the, variant, which, became, known, as, backgammon, began, to, emerge, in, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, in, medieval, italy, barail, was, played, on, a, backgammon, board, with, the, important, difference, that, both, players, moved, their, pieces, counter, clockwise, and, starting, from, the, same, side, of, the, board, the, game, rules, for, barail, are, recorded, in, a, 13th, century, manuscript, held, in, the, italian, national, library, in, florence, the, earliest, mention, of, backgammon, under, the, name, baggammon, was, by, james, howell, in, a, letter, dated, 1635, in, english, the, word, backgammon, is, most, likely, derived, from, back, and, middle, english, gamen, meaning, game, or, play, meanwhile, the, first, use, documented, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, was, in, 1650, in, 1666, it, is, reported, that, the, old, name, for, backgammon, used, by, shakespeare, and, others, was, tables, however, it, is, clear, from, willughby, that, tables, was, a, generic, name, and, that, the, phrase, playing, at, tables, was, used, in, a, similar, way, to, playing, at, cards, the, first, known, rules, of, back, gammon, were, produced, by, francis, willughby, around, 1672, they, were, quickly, followed, by, charles, cotton, in, 1674, in, the, 16th, century, elizabethan, laws, and, church, regulations, had, prohibited, playing, at, tables, in, england, but, by, the, 18th, century, backgammon, had, superseded, irish, and, become, popular, among, the, english, clergy, edmond, hoyle, published, a, short, treatise, on, the, game, of, back, gammon, in, 1753, this, described, rules, and, strategy, for, the, game, and, was, bound, together, with, a, similar, text, on, whist, the, early, form, of, backgammon, was, very, similar, to, its, predecessor, irish, the, aim, board, number, of, pieces, or, men, direction, of, play, and, starting, layout, were, the, same, as, in, the, modern, game, however, there, was, no, doubling, die, there, was, no, bar, on, the, board, or, the, bar, was, not, used, men, simply, being, moved, off, the, table, when, hit, and, the, scoring, was, different, the, game, was, won, double, if, either, the, winning, throw, was, a, doublet, or, the, opponent, still, had, men, outside, the, home, board, it, was, won, triple, if, a, player, bore, all, men, off, before, any, of, the, opponent, s, men, reached, the, home, board, this, was, a, back, gammon, some, terminology, such, as, point, hitting, a, blot, home, doublet, bear, off, and, men, are, recognisably, the, same, as, in, the, modern, game, others, such, as, binding, a, man, adding, a, second, man, to, a, point, binding, up, the, tables, taking, all, one, s, first, 6, points, fore, game, latter, game, nipping, a, man, hitting, a, blot, and, playing, it, on, forwards, playing, at, length, using, both, dice, to, move, one, man, are, no, longer, in, vogue, by, no, later, than, 1850, the, rules, of, play, had, changed, to, those, used, today, tables, boards, were, now, made, with, a, bar, in, the, centre, and, men, that, were, hit, went, onto, the, bar, winning, double, or, by, two, hits, was, achieved, by, bearing, all, one, s, men, off, before, the, other, has, borne, any, this, was, now, called, a, gammon, if, the, winner, bore, off, all, men, while, the, loser, still, had, men, in, his, adversary, s, table, it, was, a, back, gammon, and, worth, three, hits, i, e, triple, the, most, recent, major, development, in, backgammon, was, the, addition, of, the, doubling, cube, doubles, had, originally, been, recorded, by, placing, common, parlour, matches, on, the, bar, in, the, centre, of, the, board, a, doubling, cube, was, first, introduced, in, the, 1920s, in, new, york, city, among, members, of, gaming, clubs, in, the, lower, east, side, the, cube, required, players, not, only, to, select, the, best, move, in, a, given, position, but, also, to, estimate, the, probability, of, winning, from, that, position, transforming, backgammon, into, the, expected, value, driven, game, played, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, the, popularity, of, backgammon, surged, in, the, mid, 1960s, in, part, due, to, the, charisma, of, prince, alexis, obolensky, who, became, known, as, the, father, of, modern, backgammon, obe, as, he, was, called, by, friends, co, founded, the, international, backgammon, association, which, published, a, set, of, official, rules, he, also, established, the, world, backgammon, club, of, manhattan, devised, a, backgammon, tournament, system, in, 1963, then, organized, the, first, major, international, backgammon, tournament, in, march, 1964, which, attracted, royalty, celebrities, and, the, press, the, game, became, a, huge, fad, and, was, played, on, college, campuses, in, discoth, ques, and, at, country, clubs, stockbrokers, and, bankers, began, playing, at, conservative, men, s, clubs, people, young, and, old, all, across, the, country, dusted, off, their, boards, and, pieces, cigarette, liquor, and, car, companies, began, to, sponsor, tournaments, and, hugh, hefner, held, backgammon, parties, at, the, playboy, mansion, backgammon, clubs, were, formed, and, tournaments, were, held, resulting, in, a, world, championship, promoted, in, las, vegas, in, 1967, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, new, terms, were, introduced, in, america, such, as, beaver, and, checkers, for, men, although, american, backgammon, experts, jacoby, and, crawford, continued, to, use, both, the, older, terms, as, well, as, the, new, ones, most, recently, the, united, states, backgammon, federation, usbgf, was, organized, in, 2009, to, repopularize, the, game, in, the, united, states, board, and, committee, members, include, many, of, the, top, players, tournament, directors, and, writers, in, the, worldwide, backgammon, community, the, usbgf, has, recently, created, standards, of, ethical, practice, to, address, issues, on, which, tournament, rules, fail, to, touch, in, its, country, of, origin, the, uk, backgammon, federation, is, the, national, authority, and, runs, a, backgammon, championship, the, backgammon, galaxy, uk, open, tournament, as, well, as, club, championships, online, leagues, and, knockout, tournaments, like, the, usbgf, they, are, active, members, of, the, world, backgammon, federation, wbf, and, their, tournament, rules, have, been, adopted, in, their, entirety, by, the, wbf, backgammon, software, has, been, developed, not, only, to, play, and, analyze, games, but, also, for, people, to, play, one, another, over, the, internet, dice, rolls, are, provided, by, random, or, pseudorandom, number, generators, real, time, online, play, began, with, the, first, internet, backgammon, server, in, july, 1992, but, there, are, now, a, range, of, options, many, of, which, are, commercial, since, 2018, backgammon, has, been, overseen, internationally, by, the, world, backgammon, federation, who, set, the, rules, of, play, for, international, tournaments, backgammon, playing, pieces, may, be, termed, men, checkers, draughts, stones, counters, pawns, discs, pips, chips, or, nips, checkers, is, a, relatively, modern, american, english, term, derived, from, another, board, game, draughts, which, in, us, english, is, called, checkers, the, objective, is, for, players, to, bear, off, all, their, disc, pieces, from, the, board, before, their, opponent, can, do, the, same, as, the, playing, time, for, each, individual, game, is, short, it, is, often, played, in, matches, where, victory, is, awarded, to, the, first, player, to, reach, a, certain, number, of, points, the, dimensions, of, a, board, when, opened, for, a, tournament, game, should, be, at, a, minimum, of, 44, cm, by, 55, cm, to, a, maximum, of, 66, cm, by, 88, cm, each, side, of, the, board, has, a, track, of, 12, long, triangles, called, points, the, points, form, a, continuous, track, in, the, shape, of, a, horseshoe, and, are, numbered, from, 1, to, 24, in, the, most, commonly, used, setup, each, player, begins, with, fifteen, pieces, two, are, placed, on, their, 24, point, three, on, their, 8, point, and, five, each, on, their, 13, point, and, their, 6, point, the, two, players, move, their, pieces, in, opposing, directions, from, the, 24, point, towards, the, 1, point, points, 1, through, 6, are, called, the, home, board, or, inner, board, and, points, 7, through, 12, are, called, the, outer, board, the, 7, point, is, referred, to, as, the, bar, point, and, the, 13, point, as, the, midpoint, usually, the, 5, point, for, each, player, is, called, the, golden, point, to, start, the, game, each, player, rolls, one, die, and, the, player, with, the, higher, number, moves, first, using, the, numbers, shown, on, both, dice, if, the, players, roll, the, same, number, they, must, roll, again, leaving, the, first, pair, of, dice, on, the, board, the, player, with, the, higher, number, on, the, second, roll, moves, using, only, the, numbers, shown, on, the, dice, used, for, the, second, roll, both, dice, must, land, completely, flat, on, the, right, hand, side, of, the, gameboard, the, players, then, take, alternate, turns, rolling, two, dice, at, the, beginning, of, each, turn, after, rolling, the, dice, players, must, if, possible, move, their, pieces, according, to, the, number, shown, on, each, die, for, example, if, the, player, rolls, a, 6, and, a, 3, denoted, as, 6, 3, the, player, must, move, one, checker, six, points, forward, and, another, or, the, same, checker, three, points, forward, the, same, checker, may, be, moved, twice, as, long, as, the, two, moves, can, be, made, separately, and, legally, six, and, then, three, or, three, and, then, six, if, a, player, rolls, two, of, the, same, number, called, doubles, that, player, must, play, each, die, twice, for, example, a, roll, of, 5, 5, allows, the, player, to, make, four, moves, of, five, spaces, each, on, any, roll, a, player, must, move, according, to, the, numbers, on, both, dice, if, it, is, at, all, possible, to, do, so, if, one, or, both, numbers, do, not, allow, a, legal, move, the, player, forfeits, that, portion, of, the, roll, and, the, turn, ends, if, moves, can, be, made, according, to, either, one, die, or, the, other, but, not, both, the, higher, number, must, be, used, if, one, die, is, unable, to, be, moved, but, such, a, move, is, made, possible, by, the, moving, of, the, other, die, that, move, is, compulsory, in, the, course, of, a, move, a, checker, may, land, on, any, point, that, is, unoccupied, or, is, occupied, by, one, or, more, of, the, player, s, own, checkers, it, may, also, land, on, a, point, occupied, by, exactly, one, opposing, checker, or, blot, in, this, case, the, blot, has, been, hit, and, is, placed, in, the, middle, of, the, board, on, the, bar, that, divides, the, two, sides, of, the, playing, surface, a, checker, may, never, land, on, a, point, occupied, by, two, or, more, opposing, checkers, thus, no, point, is, ever, occupied, by, checkers, from, both, players, simultaneously, there, is, no, limit, to, the, number, of, checkers, that, can, occupy, a, point, or, the, bar, at, any, given, time, checkers, placed, on, the, bar, must, re, enter, the, game, through, the, opponent, s, home, board, before, any, other, move, can, be, made, a, roll, of, 1, allows, the, checker, to, enter, on, the, 24, point, opponent, s, 1, a, roll, of, 2, on, the, 23, point, opponent, s, 2, and, so, forth, up, to, a, roll, of, 6, allowing, entry, on, the, 19, point, opponent, s, 6, checkers, may, not, enter, on, a, point, occupied, by, two, or, more, opposing, checkers, checkers, can, enter, on, unoccupied, points, or, on, points, occupied, by, a, single, opposing, checker, in, the, latter, case, the, single, checker, is, hit, and, placed, on, the, bar, a, player, may, not, move, any, other, checkers, until, all, checkers, belonging, to, that, player, on, the, bar, have, re, entered, the, board, if, a, player, has, checkers, on, the, bar, but, rolls, a, combination, that, does, not, allow, any, of, those, checkers, to, re, enter, the, player, does, not, move, if, the, opponent, s, home, board, is, completely, closed, i, e, all, six, points, are, each, occupied, by, two, or, more, checkers, there, is, no, roll, that, will, allow, a, player, to, enter, a, checker, from, the, bar, and, that, player, stops, rolling, and, playing, until, at, least, one, point, becomes, open, occupied, by, one, or, zero, checkers, due, to, the, opponent, s, moves, a, turn, ends, only, when, the, player, has, removed, his, or, her, dice, from, the, board, prior, to, this, moment, a, move, can, be, undone, and, replayed, an, unlimited, number, of, times, when, all, of, a, player, s, checkers, are, in, that, player, s, home, board, that, player, may, start, removing, them, this, is, called, bearing, off, a, roll, of, 1, may, be, used, to, bear, off, a, checker, from, the, 1, point, a, 2, from, the, 2, point, and, so, on, if, all, of, a, player, s, checkers, are, on, points, lower, than, the, number, showing, on, a, particular, die, the, player, must, use, that, die, to, bear, off, one, checker, from, the, highest, occupied, point, for, example, if, a, player, rolls, a, 6, and, a, 5, but, has, no, checkers, on, the, 6, point, and, two, on, the, 5, point, then, the, 6, and, the, 5, must, be, used, to, bear, off, the, two, checkers, from, the, 5, point, when, bearing, off, a, player, may, also, move, a, lower, die, roll, before, the, higher, even, if, that, means, the, full, value, of, the, higher, die, is, not, fully, utilized, for, example, if, a, player, has, exactly, one, checker, remaining, on, the, 6, point, and, rolls, a, 6, and, a, 1, the, player, may, move, the, 6, point, checker, one, place, to, the, 5, point, with, the, lower, die, roll, of, 1, and, then, bear, that, checker, off, the, 5, point, using, the, die, roll, of, 6, this, is, sometimes, useful, tactically, as, before, if, there, is, a, way, to, use, all, moves, showing, on, the, dice, by, moving, checkers, within, the, home, board, or, by, bearing, them, off, the, player, must, do, so, if, a, player, s, checker, is, hit, while, in, the, process, of, bearing, off, that, player, may, not, bear, off, any, others, until, it, has, been, re, entered, into, the, game, and, moved, into, the, player, s, home, board, according, to, the, normal, movement, rules, the, first, player, to, bear, off, all, fifteen, of, their, own, checkers, wins, the, game, when, keeping, score, in, backgammon, the, points, awarded, depend, on, the, scale, of, the, victory, a, player, who, bears, off, all, fifteen, pieces, when, the, opponent, has, borne, off, at, least, one, wins, a, single, game, worth, 1, point, if, all, fifteen, have, been, borne, off, before, the, opponent, gets, at, least, one, checker, off, this, is, a, gammon, or, double, game, worth, 2, points, a, backgammon, or, triple, game, is, worth, 3, points, and, occurs, when, the, losing, player, has, borne, off, no, pieces, and, has, one, or, more, on, the, bar, and, or, in, the, winner, s, home, table, inner, board, to, speed, up, match, play, and, to, provide, an, added, dimension, for, strategy, a, doubling, cube, is, usually, used, the, doubling, cube, is, not, a, die, to, be, rolled, but, rather, a, marker, with, the, numbers, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and, 64, inscribed, on, its, sides, to, denote, the, current, stake, at, the, start, of, each, game, the, doubling, cube, is, placed, on, the, midpoint, of, the, bar, with, the, number, 64, showing, the, cube, is, then, said, to, be, centered, on, 1, when, the, cube, is, still, centered, either, player, may, start, their, turn, by, proposing, that, the, game, be, played, for, twice, the, current, stakes, their, opponent, must, either, accept, take, the, doubled, stakes, or, resign, drop, the, game, immediately, whenever, a, player, accepts, doubled, stakes, the, cube, is, placed, on, their, side, of, the, board, with, the, corresponding, power, of, two, facing, upward, to, indicate, that, the, right, to, redouble, which, is, to, offer, to, continue, doubling, the, stakes, belongs, exclusively, to, that, player, if, the, opponent, drops, the, doubled, stakes, they, lose, the, game, at, the, current, value, of, the, doubling, cube, for, instance, if, the, cube, showed, the, number, 2, and, a, player, wanted, to, redouble, the, stakes, to, put, it, at, 4, the, opponent, choosing, to, drop, the, redouble, would, lose, two, or, twice, the, original, stake, there, is, no, limit, on, the, number, of, redoubles, although, 64, is, the, highest, number, depicted, on, the, doubling, cube, the, stakes, may, rise, to, 128, 256, and, so, on, in, money, games, a, player, is, often, permitted, to, beaver, when, offered, the, cube, doubling, the, value, of, the, game, again, while, retaining, possession, of, the, cube, a, variant, of, the, doubling, cube, beaver, is, the, raccoon, players, who, doubled, their, opponent, seeing, the, opponent, beaver, the, cube, may, in, turn, then, double, the, stakes, once, again, raccoon, as, part, of, that, cube, phase, before, any, dice, are, rolled, the, opponent, retains, the, doubling, cube, an, example, of, a, raccoon, is, the, following, white, doubles, black, to, 2, points, black, accepts, then, beavers, the, cube, to, 4, points, white, confident, of, a, win, raccoons, the, cube, to, 8, points, while, black, retains, the, cube, such, a, move, adds, greatly, to, the, risk, of, having, to, face, the, doubling, cube, coming, back, at, 8, times, its, original, value, when, first, doubling, the, opponent, offered, at, 2, points, counter, offered, at, 16, points, should, the, luck, of, the, dice, change, some, players, may, opt, to, invoke, the, murphy, rule, or, the, automatic, double, rule, if, both, opponents, roll, the, same, opening, number, the, doubling, cube, is, incremented, on, each, occasion, yet, remains, in, the, middle, of, the, board, available, to, either, player, the, murphy, rule, may, be, invoked, with, a, maximum, number, of, automatic, doubles, allowed, and, that, limit, is, agreed, to, prior, to, a, game, or, match, commencing, when, a, player, decides, to, double, the, opponent, the, value, is, then, a, double, of, whatever, face, value, is, shown, e, g, if, two, automatic, doubles, have, occurred, putting, the, cube, up, to, 4, the, first, in, game, double, will, be, for, 8, points, the, murphy, rule, is, not, an, official, rule, in, backgammon, and, is, rarely, if, ever, seen, in, use, at, officially, sanctioned, tournaments, the, jacoby, rule, named, after, oswald, jacoby, allows, gammons, and, backgammons, to, count, for, their, respective, double, and, triple, values, only, if, the, cube, has, already, been, offered, and, accepted, this, encourages, a, player, with, a, large, lead, to, double, possibly, ending, the, game, rather, than, to, play, it, to, conclusion, hoping, for, a, gammon, or, backgammon, the, jacoby, rule, is, widely, used, in, money, play, but, is, not, used, in, match, play, the, crawford, rule, named, after, john, r, crawford, is, designed, to, make, match, play, more, equitable, for, the, player, in, the, lead, if, a, player, is, one, point, away, from, winning, a, match, that, player, s, opponent, will, always, want, to, double, as, early, as, possible, in, order, to, catch, up, whether, the, game, is, worth, one, point, or, two, the, trailing, player, must, win, to, continue, the, match, to, balance, the, situation, the, crawford, rule, requires, that, when, a, player, first, reaches, a, score, one, point, short, of, winning, neither, player, may, use, the, doubling, cube, for, the, following, game, called, the, crawford, game, after, the, crawford, game, normal, use, of, the, doubling, cube, resumes, the, crawford, rule, is, routinely, used, in, tournament, match, play, it, is, possible, for, a, crawford, game, to, never, occur, in, a, match, if, the, crawford, rule, is, in, effect, then, another, option, is, the, holland, rule, named, after, tim, holland, which, stipulates, that, after, the, crawford, game, a, player, cannot, double, until, after, at, least, two, rolls, have, been, played, by, each, side, it, was, common, in, tournament, play, in, the, 1980s, but, is, now, rarely, used, minor, variations, to, the, standard, game, are, common, among, casual, players, in, certain, regions, for, instance, only, allowing, a, maximum, of, five, men, on, any, point, britain, or, disallowing, hit, and, run, in, the, home, board, middle, east, there, are, also, many, relatives, of, backgammon, within, the, tables, family, with, different, aims, modes, of, play, and, strategies, some, are, played, primarily, throughout, one, geographic, region, and, others, add, new, tactical, elements, to, the, game, these, other, tables, games, commonly, have, a, different, starting, position, restrict, certain, moves, or, assign, special, value, to, certain, dice, rolls, but, in, some, geographic, games, even, the, rules, and, direction, of, movement, of, the, counters, change, rendering, them, fundamentally, different, acey, deucey, is, a, relative, of, backgammon, in, which, players, start, with, no, counters, on, the, board, and, must, enter, them, onto, the, board, at, the, beginning, of, the, game, the, roll, of, 1, 2, is, given, special, consideration, allowing, the, player, after, moving, the, 1, and, the, 2, to, select, any, desired, doubles, move, a, player, also, receives, an, extra, turn, after, a, roll, of, 1, 2, or, of, doubles, hypergammon, is, a, game, in, which, players, have, only, three, counters, on, the, board, starting, with, one, each, on, the, 24, 23, and, 22, points, with, the, aid, of, a, computer, this, game, was, solved, by, hugh, sconyers, around, 1994, meaning, that, exact, equities, for, all, cube, positions, are, available, for, all, 32, million, possible, positions, nard, is, a, traditional, tables, game, from, persia, which, may, be, an, ancestor, of, backgammon, it, has, a, different, opening, layout, in, which, all, 15, pieces, start, on, the, 24th, point, during, play, pieces, may, not, be, hit, and, there, are, no, gammons, or, backgammons, russian, backgammon, is, a, variant, described, in, 1895, as, much, in, vogue, in, russia, germany, and, other, parts, of, the, continent, players, start, with, no, counters, on, the, board, and, both, players, move, in, the, same, direction, to, bear, off, in, a, common, home, board, in, this, variant, doubles, are, powerful, four, moves, are, played, as, in, backgammon, followed, by, four, moves, according, to, the, difference, of, the, dice, value, from, 7, and, then, the, player, has, another, turn, with, the, caveat, that, the, turn, ends, if, any, portion, of, it, cannot, be, completed, gul, bara, and, tapa, are, tables, games, popular, in, south, eastern, europe, and, turkey, the, play, will, iterate, among, backgammon, gul, bara, and, tapa, until, one, of, the, players, reaches, a, score, of, 7, or, 5, coan, ki, is, an, ancient, chinese, tables, game, plakoto, fevga, and, portes, are, three, varieties, of, tables, games, played, in, greece, together, the, three, are, referred, to, as, tavli, and, are, usually, played, one, after, the, other, game, being, three, five, or, seven, points, misere, backgammon, to, lose, is, a, variant, of, backgammon, in, which, the, objective, is, to, lose, the, game, tavla, is, a, turkish, variation, backgammon, has, an, established, opening, theory, although, it, is, less, detailed, than, that, of, chess, the, tree, of, positions, expands, rapidly, because, of, the, number, of, possible, dice, rolls, and, the, moves, available, on, each, turn, recent, computer, analysis, has, offered, more, insight, on, opening, plays, but, the, midgame, is, reached, quickly, after, the, opening, backgammon, players, frequently, rely, on, some, established, general, strategies, combining, and, switching, among, them, to, adapt, to, the, changing, conditions, of, a, game, a, blot, has, the, highest, probability, of, being, hit, when, it, is, 6, points, away, from, an, opponent, s, checker, strategies, can, derive, from, that, the, most, direct, one, is, simply, to, avoid, being, hit, trapped, or, held, in, a, stand, off, a, running, game, describes, a, strategy, of, moving, as, quickly, as, possible, around, the, board, and, is, most, successful, when, a, player, is, already, ahead, in, the, race, when, this, fails, one, may, opt, for, a, holding, game, maintaining, control, of, a, point, on, one, s, opponent, s, side, of, the, board, called, an, anchor, as, the, game, progresses, this, player, may, gain, an, advantage, by, hitting, an, opponent, s, blot, from, the, anchor, or, by, rolling, large, doubles, that, allow, the, checkers, to, escape, into, a, running, game, the, priming, game, involves, building, a, wall, of, checkers, called, a, prime, covering, a, number, of, consecutive, points, this, obstructs, opposing, checkers, that, are, behind, the, prime, a, checker, trapped, behind, a, six, point, prime, cannot, escape, until, the, prime, is, broken, a, particularly, successful, priming, effort, may, lead, to, a, blitz, which, is, a, strategy, of, covering, the, entire, home, board, as, quickly, as, possible, while, keeping, one, s, opponent, on, the, bar, because, the, opponent, has, difficulty, re, entering, from, the, bar, or, escaping, a, player, can, quickly, gain, a, running, advantage, and, win, the, game, often, with, a, gammon, a, backgame, is, a, strategy, that, involves, holding, two, or, more, anchors, in, an, opponent, s, home, board, while, being, substantially, behind, in, the, race, the, anchors, obstruct, the, opponent, s, checkers, and, create, opportunities, to, hit, them, as, they, move, home, the, backgame, is, generally, used, only, to, salvage, a, game, wherein, a, player, is, already, significantly, behind, using, a, backgame, as, an, initial, strategy, is, usually, unsuccessful, duplication, refers, to, the, placement, of, checkers, such, that, one, s, opponent, needs, the, same, dice, rolls, to, achieve, different, goals, for, example, players, may, position, all, of, their, blots, in, such, a, way, that, the, opponent, must, roll, a, 2, in, order, to, hit, any, of, them, reducing, the, probability, of, being, hit, more, than, once, diversification, refers, to, a, complementary, tactic, of, placing, one, s, own, checkers, in, such, a, way, that, more, numbers, are, useful, many, positions, require, a, measurement, of, a, player, s, standing, in, the, race, for, example, in, making, a, doubling, cube, decision, or, in, determining, whether, to, run, home, and, begin, bearing, off, the, minimum, total, of, pips, needed, to, move, a, player, s, checkers, around, and, off, the, board, is, called, the, pip, count, the, difference, between, the, two, players, pip, counts, is, frequently, used, as, a, measure, of, the, leader, s, racing, advantage, players, often, use, mental, calculation, techniques, to, determine, pip, counts, in, live, play, backgammon, is, played, in, two, principal, variations, money, and, match, play, money, play, means, that, every, point, counts, evenly, and, every, game, stands, alone, whether, money, is, actually, being, wagered, or, not, match, play, means, that, the, players, play, until, one, side, scores, or, exceeds, a, certain, number, of, points, the, format, has, a, significant, effect, on, strategy, in, a, match, the, objective, is, not, to, win, the, maximum, possible, number, of, points, but, rather, to, simply, reach, the, score, needed, to, win, the, match, for, example, a, player, leading, a, 9, point, match, by, a, score, of, 7, 5, would, be, very, reluctant, to, turn, the, doubling, cube, as, their, opponent, could, take, and, make, a, costless, redouble, to, 4, placing, the, entire, outcome, of, the, match, on, the, current, game, conversely, the, trailing, player, would, double, very, aggressively, particularly, if, they, have, chances, to, win, a, gammon, in, the, current, game, in, money, play, the, theoretically, correct, checker, play, and, cube, action, would, never, vary, based, on, the, score, in, 1975, emmet, keeler, and, joel, spencer, considered, the, question, of, when, to, double, or, accept, a, double, using, an, idealized, version, of, backgammon, in, their, idealized, version, the, probability, of, winning, varies, randomly, over, time, by, brownian, motion, and, there, are, no, gammons, or, backgammons, they, showed, that, the, optimal, time, to, offer, a, double, was, when, the, probability, of, winning, reached, 80, and, it, is, wise, to, accept, a, double, only, if, the, probability, of, winning, is, at, least, 20, as, their, assumptions, do, not, correspond, perfectly, to, the, real, game, actual, doubling, strategy, may, vary, but, the, 80, number, still, provides, a, possible, rule, of, thumb, to, reduce, the, possibility, of, cheating, most, good, quality, backgammon, sets, use, precision, dice, and, a, dice, cup, this, reduces, the, likelihood, of, loaded, dice, being, used, which, is, the, main, way, of, cheating, in, face, to, face, play, a, common, method, of, cheating, online, is, the, use, of, a, computer, program, to, find, the, optimal, move, on, each, turn, to, combat, this, many, online, sites, use, move, comparison, software, that, identifies, when, a, player, s, moves, resemble, those, of, a, backgammon, program, online, cheating, has, therefore, become, extremely, difficult, in, state, of, oregon, v, barr, a, 1982, court, case, pivotal, to, the, continued, widespread, organised, playing, of, backgammon, in, the, us, the, state, argued, that, backgammon, is, a, game, of, chance, and, that, it, was, therefore, subject, to, oregon, s, stringent, gambling, laws, paul, magriel, was, a, key, witness, for, the, defence, contradicting, roger, nelson, the, expert, prosecution, witness, by, saying, game, theory, however, really, applies, to, games, with, imperfect, knowledge, where, something, is, concealed, such, as, poker, backgammon, is, not, such, a, game, everything, is, in, front, of, you, the, person, who, uses, that, information, in, the, most, effective, manner, will, win, after, the, closing, arguments, judge, stephen, s, walker, concluded, that, backgammon, is, a, game, of, skill, not, a, game, of, chance, and, found, the, defendant, backgammon, tournament, director, ted, barr, not, guilty, of, promoting, gambling, enthusiasts, have, formed, clubs, for, social, play, of, backgammon, local, clubs, may, hold, informal, gatherings, with, members, meeting, at, caf, s, and, bars, in, the, evening, to, play, and, converse, a, few, clubs, offer, additional, services, maintaining, their, own, facilities, or, offering, computer, analysis, of, troublesome, plays, around, 2003, some, club, leaders, noticed, a, growth, of, interest, in, backgammon, and, attributed, it, to, the, game, s, popularity, on, the, internet, a, backgammon, chouette, permits, three, or, more, players, to, participate, in, a, single, game, often, for, money, one, player, competes, against, a, team, of, all, the, other, participants, and, positions, rotate, after, each, game, chouette, play, often, permits, the, use, of, multiple, doubling, cubes, backgammon, clubs, may, also, organize, tournaments, large, club, tournaments, sometimes, draw, competitors, from, other, regions, with, final, matches, viewed, by, hundreds, of, spectators, the, top, players, at, regional, tournaments, often, compete, in, major, national, and, international, championships, winners, at, major, tournaments, may, receive, prizes, of, tens, of, thousands, of, dollars, the, first, world, championship, competition, in, backgammon, was, held, in, las, vegas, nevada, in, 1967, tim, holland, was, declared, the, winner, that, year, and, at, the, tournament, the, following, year, for, unknown, reasons, there, was, no, championship, in, 1970, but, in, 1971, tim, holland, again, won, the, title, the, competition, remained, in, las, vegas, until, 1975, when, it, moved, to, paradise, island, in, the, bahamas, the, years, 1976, 1977, and, 1978, saw, dual, world, championships, one, in, the, bahamas, attended, by, the, americans, and, the, european, open, championships, in, monte, carlo, with, mostly, european, players, in, 1979, lewis, deyong, who, had, promoted, the, bahamas, world, championship, for, the, prior, three, years, suggested, that, the, two, events, be, combined, monte, carlo, was, universally, acknowledged, as, the, site, of, the, world, backgammon, championship, and, has, remained, as, such, for, thirty, years, the, monte, carlo, tournament, draws, hundreds, of, players, and, spectators, and, is, played, over, the, course, of, a, week, by, the, 21st, century, the, largest, international, tournaments,

2006, from, cannes, and, later, the, backgammon, million, tournament, held, in, the, bahamas, in, january, 2007, with, a, prize, pool, of, one, million, dollars, the, largest, for, any, tournament, to, date, in, 2008, the, world, series, of, backgammon, ran, the, world, s, largest, international, events, in, london, the, uk, masters, the, biggest, tournament, ever, held, in, the, uk, with, 128, international, class, players, the, nordic, open, which, instantly, became, the, largest, in, the, world, with, around, 500, players, in, all, flights, and, 153, in, the, championship, and, cannes, which, hosted, the, riviera, cup, the, traditional, follow, up, tournament, to, the, world, championships, cannes, also, hosted, the, wsob, championship, the, wsob, finale, which, saw, 16, players,

the, biggest, backgammon, tour, on, the, circuit, since, 2007, the, european, backgammon, tour, ebgt, in, 2011, the, wba, collaborated, with, the, online, backgammon, provider, play65, for, the, 2011, season, of, the, european, backgammon, tour, and, with, betfair, in, 2012, the, 2013, season, of, the, european, backgammon, tour, featured, 11, stops, and, 19, qualified, players, competing, for, 19, 000, in, a, grand, finale, in, lefkosa, northern, cyprus, when, backgammon, is, played, for, money, the, most, common, arrangement, is, to, assign, a, monetary, value, to, each, point, and, to, play, to, a, certain, score, or, until, either, player, chooses, to, stop, the, stakes, are, raised, by, gammons, backgammons, and, use, of, the, doubling, cube, backgammon, is, sometimes, available, in, casinos, before, the, commercialization, of, artificial, neural, network, programs, proposition, bets, on, specific, positions, were, very, common, among, backgammon, players, and, gamblers, as, with, most, gambling, games, successful, play, requires, a, combination, of, luck, and, skill, as, a, single, dice, roll, can, sometimes, significantly, change, the, outcome, of, the, game, backgammon, is, considered, the, national, game, in, many, countries, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, egypt, turkey, cyprus, syria, israel, palestine, lebanon, and, greece, the, popularity, of, the, game, across, the, region, is, primarily, an, oral, tradition, and, appears, to, have, been, strengthened, during, the, era, of, the, ottoman, empire, which, controlled, the, whole, eastern, mediterranean, in, the, early, modern, period, afif, bahnassi, syria, s, director, of, antiquities, stated, in, 1988, for, some, reason, backgammon, became, the, rage, of, the, ottoman, empire, it, really, spread, across, the, arab, world, with, the, turks, and, it, stayed, behind, when, they, left, the, game, is, a, common, feature, of, coffeehouses, throughout, the, region, since, at, least, the, early, 19th, century, damascus, became, well, known, as, the, preeminent, location, for, damascene, style, wooden, marquetry, backgammon, sets, that, have, become, famous, throughout, the, region, a, unique, feature, of, backgammon, throughout, the, region, is, players, use, of, mixed, persian, and, turkish, numbers, to, announce, dice, rolls, rather, than, arabic, or, other, local, languages, related, to, this, phenomenon, the, game, is, frequently, referred, to, as, shesh, besh, which, is, a, rhyming, combination, shesh, meaning, six, in, persian, as, well, as, many, historical, and, current, semitic, languages, and, besh, meaning, five, in, turkish, shesh, besh, is, commonly, used, to, refer, to, when, a, player, scores, a, 5, and, 6, at, the, same, time, on, dice, this, language, contains, six, types, of, irregular, inflections, in, the, early, 20th, century, as, use, of, classical, arabic, was, being, promoted, with, the, rise, of, arab, nationalism, efforts, were, made, to, replace, the, persian, turkish, numbers, used, in, backgammon, play, backgammon, has, been, studied, considerably, by, computer, scientists, neural, networks, and, other, approaches, have, offered, significant, advances, to, software, for, gameplay, and, analysis, with, 15, white, and, 15, black, counters, and, 24, possible, positions, backgammon, has, 18, quintillion, possible, legal, positions, the, first, strong, computer, opponent, was, bkg, 9, 8, it, was, written, by, hans, berliner, in, the, late, 1970s, on, a, dec, pdp, 10, as, an, experiment, in, evaluating, board, game, positions, early, versions, of, bkg, played, badly, even, against, poor, players, but, berliner, noticed, that, its, critical, mistakes, were, always, at, transitional, phases, in, the, game, he, applied, principles, of, fuzzy, logic, to, improve, its, play, between, phases, and, by, july, 1979, bkg, 9, 8, was, strong, enough, to, play, against, the, reigning, world, champion, luigi, villa, it, won, the, match, 7, 1, becoming, the, first, computer, program, to, defeat, a, world, champion, in, any, board, game, berliner, stated, that, the, victory, was, largely, a, matter, of, luck, as, the, computer, received, more, favorable, dice, rolls, in, the, late, 1980s, backgammon, programmers, found, more, success, with, an, approach, based, on, artificial, neural, networks, td, gammon, developed, by, gerald, tesauro, of, ibm, was, the, first, of, these, programs, to, play, near, the, expert, level, its, neural, network, was, trained, using, temporal, difference, learning, applied, to, data, generated, from, self, play, according, to, assessments, by, bill, robertie, and, kit, woolsey, td, gammon, s, play, was, at, or, above, the, level, of, the, top, human, players, in, the, world, woolsey, said, of, the, program, that, there, is, no, question, in, my, mind, that, its, positional, judgment, is, far, better, than, mine, tesauro, proposed, using, rollout, analysis, to, compare, the, performance, of, computer, algorithms, against, human, players, in, this, method, a, monte, carlo, evaluation, of, positions, is, conducted, typically, thousands, of, trials, where, different, random, dice, sequences, are, simulated, the, rollout, score, of, the, human, or, the, computer, is, the, difference, of, the, average, game, results, by, following, the, selected, move, versus, following, the, best, move, then, averaged, for, the, entire, set, of, taken, moves, neural, network, research, has, resulted, in, three, modern, proprietary, programs, jellyfish, snowie, and, extreme, gammon, as, well, as, the, shareware, bgblitz, and, the, free, software, gnu, backgammon, these, programs, not, only, play, the, game, but, offer, tools, for, analyzing, games, and, detailed, comparisons, of, individual, moves, the, strength, of, these, programs, lies, in, their, neural, networks, weights, tables, which, are, the, result, of, months, of, training, without, them, these, programs, play, no, better, than, a, human, novice, for, the, bearoff, phase, backgammon, software, usually, relies, on, a, database, containing, precomputed, equities, for, all, possible, bearoff, positions, there, are, 54, 263, bearoff, positions, for, each, side, this, means, there, are, 54263, 2, total, bearoff, positions, 3, billion, positions, in, 1981, hugh, sconyers, wrote, a, computer, program, that, solved, all, positions, with, nine, checkers, or, fewer, for, both, sides, in, the, early, 1990s, hugh, extended, his, results, to, all, bearoff, positions, for, each, position, there, are, four, results, no, cube, roller, s, cube, center, cube, and, opponent, s, cube, so, hugh, s, bearoff, database, contains, the, exact, answers, to, 12, billion, bearoff, situations, another, neural, network, software, developed, by, nikolaos, papachristou, is, palamedes, that, was, developed, in, the, early, 2000s, and, it, can, also, play, variations, like, hypergammon, portes, plakoto, fevga, narde, and, has, multiple, engines, for, each, one, computer, versus, computer, competitions, are, also, held, at, computer, olympiad, events
