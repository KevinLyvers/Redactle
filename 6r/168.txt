acknowledge, and, uphold, intimate, relationships, between, people, however, intimate, relationships, are, not, necessarily, monogamous, or, sexual, and, there, is, wide, social, and, cultural, variability, in, the, norms, and, practices, of, intimacy, between, people, the, course, of, an, intimate, relationship, includes, a, formation, period, prompted, by, interpersonal, attraction, and, a, growing, sense, of, closeness, and, familiarity, intimate, relationships, evolve, over, time, as, they, are, maintained, and, members, of, the, relationship, may, become, more, invested, in, and, committed, to, the, relationship, healthy, intimate, relationships, are, beneficial, for, psychological, and, physical, well, being, and, contribute, to, overall, happiness, in, life, however, challenges, including, relationship, conflict, external, stressors, insecurity, and, jealousy, can, disrupt, the, relationship, and, lead, to, distress, and, relationship, dissolution, intimacy, is, the, feeling, of, being, in, close, personal, association, with, another, person, emotional, intimacy, is, built, through, self, disclosure, and, responsive, communication, between, people, and, is, critical, for, healthy, psychological, development, and, mental, health, emotional, intimacy, produces, feelings, of, reciprocal, trust, validation, vulnerability, and, closeness, between, individuals, physical, intimacy, including, holding, hands, hugging, kissing, and, sex, promotes, connection, between, people, and, is, often, a, key, component, of, romantic, intimate, relationships, physical, touch, is, correlated, with, relationship, satisfaction, and, feelings, of, love, while, many, intimate, relationships, include, a, physical, or, sexual, component, the, potential, to, be, sexual, is, not, a, requirement, for, the, relationship, to, be, intimate, for, example, a, queerplatonic, relationship, is, a, non, romantic, intimate, relationship, that, involves, commitment, and, closeness, beyond, that, of, a, friendship, among, scholars, the, definition, of, an, intimate, relationship, is, diverse, and, evolving, some, reserve, the, term, for, romantic, relationships, whereas, other, scholars, include, friendship, and, familial, relationships, in, general, an, intimate, relationship, is, an, interpersonal, relationship, in, which, physically, or, emotionally, intimate, experiences, occur, repeatedly, over, time, interpersonal, attraction, is, the, foundation, of, first, impressions, between, potential, intimate, partners, relationship, scientists, suggest, that, the, romantic, spark, or, chemistry, that, occurs, between, people, is, a, combination, of, physical, attraction, personal, qualities, and, a, build, up, of, positive, interactions, between, people, researchers, find, physical, attractiveness, to, be, the, largest, predictor, of, initial, attraction, from, an, evolutionary, perspective, this, may, be, because, people, search, for, a, partner, or, potential, mate, who, displays, indicators, of, good, physical, health, yet, there, is, also, evidence, that, couples, in, committed, intimate, relationships, tend, to, match, each, other, in, physical, attractiveness, and, are, rated, as, similarly, physically, attractive, by, both, the, members, of, the, couple, and, by, outside, observers, an, individual, s, perception, of, their, own, attractiveness, may, therefore, influence, who, they, see, as, a, realistic, partner, beyond, physical, appearance, people, report, desirable, qualities, they, look, for, in, a, partner, such, as, trustworthiness, warmth, and, loyalty, however, these, romantic, ideals, are, not, necessarily, good, predictors, of, actual, attraction, or, relationship, success, research, has, found, little, evidence, for, the, success, of, matching, potential, partners, based, on, personality, traits, suggesting, that, romantic, chemistry, involves, more, than, compatibility, of, traits, rather, repeated, positive, interactions, between, people, and, reciprocity, of, romantic, interest, seem, to, be, key, components, in, attraction, and, relationship, formation, reciprocal, liking, is, most, meaningful, when, it, is, displayed, by, someone, who, is, selective, about, who, they, show, liking, to, when, potential, intimate, partners, are, getting, to, know, each, other, they, employ, a, variety, of, strategies, to, increase, closeness, and, gain, information, about, whether, the, other, person, is, a, desirable, partner, self, disclosure, the, process, of, revealing, information, about, oneself, is, a, crucial, aspect, of, building, intimacy, between, people, feelings, of, intimacy, increase, when, a, conversation, partner, is, perceived, as, responsive, and, reciprocates, self, disclosure, and, people, tend, to, like, others, who, disclose, emotional, information, to, them, other, strategies, used, in, the, relationship, formation, stage, include, humor, initiating, physical, touch, and, signaling, availability, and, interest, through, eye, contact, flirtatious, body, language, or, playful, interactions, engaging, in, dating, courtship, or, hookup, culture, as, part, of, the, relationship, formation, period, allows, individuals, to, explore, different, interpersonal, connections, before, further, investing, in, an, intimate, relationship, context, timing, and, external, circumstances, influence, attraction, and, whether, an, individual, is, receptive, to, beginning, an, intimate, relationship, individuals, vary, across, the, lifespan, in, feeling, ready, for, a, relationship, and, other, external, pressures, including, family, expectations, peers, being, in, committed, relationships, and, cultural, norms, influence, when, people, decide, to, pursue, an, intimate, relationship, being, in, close, physical, proximity, is, a, powerful, facilitator, for, formation, of, relationships, because, it, allows, people, to, get, to, know, each, other, through, repeated, interactions, intimate, partners, commonly, meet, at, college, or, school, as, coworkers, as, neighbors, at, bars, or, through, religious, community, speed, dating, matchmakers, and, online, dating, services, are, more, structured, formats, used, to, begin, relationships, the, internet, in, particular, has, significantly, changed, how, intimate, relationships, begin, as, it, allows, people, to, access, potential, partners, beyond, their, immediate, proximity, in, 2023, pew, research, center, found, that, 53, of, people, under, 30, have, used, online, dating, and, one, in, ten, adults, in, a, committed, relationship, met, their, partner, online, however, there, remains, skepticism, about, the, effectiveness, and, safety, of, dating, apps, due, to, their, potential, to, facilitate, dating, violence, once, an, intimate, relationship, has, been, initiated, the, relationship, changes, and, develops, over, time, and, the, members, may, engage, in, commitment, agreements, and, maintenance, behaviors, in, an, ongoing, relationship, couples, must, navigate, protecting, their, own, self, interest, alongside, the, interest, of, maintaining, the, relationship, this, necessitates, compromise, sacrifice, and, communication, in, general, feelings, of, intimacy, and, commitment, increase, as, a, relationship, progresses, while, passion, plateaus, following, the, excitement, of, the, early, stages, of, the, relationship, engaging, in, ongoing, positive, shared, communication, and, activities, is, important, for, strengthening, the, relationship, and, increasing, commitment, and, liking, between, partners, these, maintenance, behaviors, can, include, providing, assurances, about, commitment, to, the, relationship, engaging, in, shared, activities, openly, disclosing, thoughts, and, feelings, spending, time, with, mutual, friends, and, contributing, to, shared, responsibilities, physical, intimacy, including, sexual, behavior, also, increases, feelings, of, closeness, and, satisfaction, with, the, relationship, however, sexual, desire, is, often, greatest, early, in, a, relationship, and, may, wax, and, wane, as, the, relationship, evolves, significant, life, events, such, as, the, birth, of, a, child, can, drastically, change, the, relationship, and, necessitate, adaptation, and, new, approaches, to, maintaining, intimacy, the, transition, to, parenthood, can, be, a, stressful, period, that, is, generally, associated, with, a, temporary, decrease, in, healthy, relationship, functioning, and, a, decline, in, sexual, intimacy, as, a, relationship, develops, intimate, partners, often, engage, in, commitment, agreements, ceremonies, and, behaviors, to, signal, their, intention, to, remain, in, the, relationship, this, might, include, moving, in, together, sharing, responsibilities, or, property, and, getting, married, these, commitment, markers, increase, relationship, stability, because, they, create, physical, financial, and, symbolic, barriers, and, consequences, to, dissolving, the, relationship, in, general, increases, in, relationship, satisfaction, and, investment, are, associated, with, increased, commitment, individuals, in, intimate, relationships, evaluate, the, relative, personal, benefits, and, costs, of, being, in, the, relationship, and, this, contributes, to, the, decision, to, stay, or, leave, the, investment, model, of, commitment, is, a, theoretical, framework, that, suggests, that, an, evaluation, of, relationship, satisfaction, relationship, investment, and, the, quality, of, alternatives, to, the, relationship, impact, whether, an, individual, remains, in, a, relationship, because, relationships, are, rewarding, and, evolutionarily, necessary, and, rejection, is, a, stressful, process, people, are, generally, biased, toward, making, decisions, that, uphold, and, further, facilitate, intimate, relationships, these, biases, can, lead, to, distortions, in, the, evaluation, of, a, relationship, for, instance, people, in, committed, relationships, tend, to, dismiss, and, derogate, attractive, alternative, partners, thereby, validating, the, decision, to, remain, with, their, more, attractive, partner, the, decision, to, leave, a, relationship, often, involves, an, evaluation, of, levels, of, satisfaction, and, commitment, in, the, relationship, relationship, factors, such, as, increased, commitment, and, feelings, of, love, are, associated, with, lower, chances, of, breakup, whereas, feeling, ambivalent, about, the, relationship, and, perceiving, many, alternatives, to, the, current, relationship, are, associated, with, increased, chances, of, dissolution, specific, individual, characteristics, and, traits, put, people, at, greater, risk, for, experiencing, relationship, dissolution, individuals, high, in, neuroticism, the, tendency, to, experience, negative, emotions, are, more, prone, to, relationship, dissolution,

attainment, and, cohabiting, before, marriage, are, also, associated, with, risk, of, divorce, and, relationship, dissolution, these, characteristics, are, not, necessarily, the, inherent, causes, of, dissolution, rather, they, are, traits, that, impact, the, resources, that, individuals, are, able, to, draw, upon, to, work, on, their, relationships, as, well, as, reflections, of, social, and, cultural, attitudes, toward, relationship, institutions, and, divorce, common, strategies, for, ending, a, relationship, include, justifying, the, decision, apologizing, avoiding, contact, ghosting, or, suggesting, a, break, period, before, revisiting, the, decision, the, dissolution, of, an, intimate, relationship, is, a, stressful, event, that, can, have, a, negative, impact, on, well, being,

fulfilling, intimate, relationships, impact, happiness, and, satisfaction, with, life, while, people, with, better, mental, health, are, more, likely, to, enter, intimate, relationships, the,

unhappy, couples, tend, to, use, more, frequent, negative, tone, of, voice, show, more, predictable, behavior, during, communication, and, get, stuck, in, cycles, of, negative, behavior, with, their, partner, other, unproductive, strategies, within, conflict, include, avoidance, and, withdrawal, defensiveness, and, hostility, these, responses, may, be, salient, when, an, individual, feels, threatened, by, the, conflict, which, can, be, a, reflection, of, insecure, attachment, orientation, and, previous, negative, relationship, experiences, when, conflicts, go, unresolved, relationship, satisfaction, is, negatively, impacted, constructive, conflict, resolution, strategies, include, validating, the, other, person, s, point, of, view, and, concerns, expressing, affection, using, humor, and, active, listening, however, the, effectiveness, of, these, strategies, depend, on, the, topic, and, severity, of, the, conflict, and, the, characteristics, of, the, individuals, involved, repeated, stressful, instances, of, unresolved, conflict, might, cause, intimate, partners, to, seek, couples, counseling, consult, self, help, resources, or, consider, ending, the, relationship, attachment, orientations, that, develop, from, early, interpersonal, relationships, can, influence, how, people, behave, in, intimate, relationships, and, insecure, attachment, can, lead, to, specific, issues, in, a, relationship, individuals, vary, in, attachment, anxiety, the, degree, to, which, they, worry, about, abandonment, and, avoidance, the, degree, to, which, they, avoid, emotional, closeness, research, shows, that, insecure, attachment, orientations, that, are, high, in, avoidance, or, anxiety, are, associated, with, experiencing, more, frequent, negative, emotions, in, intimate, relationships, individuals, high, in, attachment, anxiety, are, particularly, prone, to, jealousy, and, experience, heightened, distress, about, whether, their, partner, will, leave, them, highly, anxious, individuals, also, perceive, more, conflict, in, their, relationships, and, are, disproportionately, negatively, affected, by, those, conflicts, in, contrast, avoidantly,

infidelity, and, sex, outside, a, monogamous, relationship, are, behaviors, that, are, commonly, disapproved, of, a, frequent, source, of, conflict, and, a, cause, of, relationship, dissolution, low, relationship, satisfaction, may, cause, people, to, desire, physical, or, emotional, connection, outside, their, primary, relationship, however, people, with, more, sexual, opportunities, greater, interest, in, sex, and, more, permissive, attitudes, toward, sex, are, also, more, likely, to, engage, in, infidelity, in, the, united, states, research, has, found, that, between, 15, and, 25, of,

abuse, the, world, health, organization, estimates, that, 30, of, women, have, experienced, physical, or, sexual, violence, perpetrated, by, an, intimate, partner, the, strong, emotional, attachment, investment, and, interdependence, that, characterizes, close, relationships, can, make, it, difficult, to, leave, an, abusive, relationship, research, has, identified, a, variety, of, risk, factors, for, and, types, of, perpetrators, of, intimate, partner, violence, individuals, who, are, exposed, to, violence, or, experience, abuse, in, childhood, are, more, likely, to, become, perpetrators, or, victims, of, intimate, partner, violence, as, adults, as, part, of, the, intergenerational, cycle, of, violence, perpetrators, are, also, more, likely, to, be, aggressive, impulsive, prone, to, anger, and, may, show, pathological, personality, traits, such, as, antisocial, and, borderline, traits, patriarchal, cultural, scripts, that, depict, men, as, aggressive, and, dominant, may, be, an, additional, risk, factor, for, men, engaging, in, violence, toward, an, intimate, partner, although, violence, by, female, perpetrators, is, also, a, well, documented, phenomenon, and, research, finds, other, contextual, and, demographic, characteristics, to, be, more, salient, risks, factors, contextual, factors, such, as, high, levels, of, stress, can, also, contribute, to, risk, of, violence, within, the, relationship, high, levels, of, conflict, and, disagreements, are, associated, with, intimate, partner, violence, particularly, for, people, who, react, to, conflict, with, hostility, cultural, context, has, influence, in, many, domains, within, intimate, relationships, including, norms, in, communication, expression, of, affection, commitment, and, marriage, practices, and, gender, roles, for, example, cross, cultural, research, finds, that, individuals, in, china, prefer, indirect, and, implicit, communication, with, their, romantic, partner, whereas, european, americans, report, preferring, direct, communication, the, use, of, a, culturally, appropriate, communication, style, influences, anticipated, relationship, satisfaction, culture, can, also, impact, expectations, within, a, relationship, and, the, relative, importance, of, various, relationship, centered, values, such, as, emotional, closeness, equity, status, and, autonomy, while, love, has, been, identified, as, a, universal, human, emotion, the, ways, love, is, expressed, and, its, importance, in, intimate, relationships, vary, based, on, the, culture, within, which, a, relationship, takes, place, culture, is, especially, salient, in, structuring, beliefs, about, institutions, that, recognize, intimate, relationships, such, as, marriage, the, idea, that, love, is, necessary, for, marriage, is, a, strongly, held, belief, in, the, united, states, whereas, in, india, a, distinction, is, made, between, traditional, arranged, marriages, and, love, marriages, also, called, personal, choice, marriages, advances, in, legal, relationship, recognition, for, same, sex, couples, have, helped, normalize, and, legitimize, same, sex, intimacy, broadly, same, sex, and, different, sex, intimate, relationships, do, not, differ, significantly, and, couples, report, similar, levels, of, relationship, satisfaction, and, stability, however, research, supports, a, few, common, differences, between, same, sex, and, different, sex, intimacy, in, the, relationship, formation, period, the, boundaries, between, friendship, and, romantic, intimacy, may, be, more, nuanced, and, complex, among, sexual, minorities, for, instance, many, lesbian, women, report, that, their, romantic, relationships, developed, from, an, existing, friendship, certain, relationship, maintenance, practices, also, differ, while, heterosexual, relationships, might, rely, on, traditional, gender, roles, to, divide, labor, and, decision, making, power, same, sex, couples, are, more, likely, to, divide, housework, evenly, lesbian, couples, report, lower, frequency, of, sex, compared, to, heterosexual, couples, and, gay, men, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, non, monogamy, same, sex, relationships, face, unique, challenges, with, regards, to, stigma, discrimination, and, social, support, as, couples, cope, with, these, obstacles, relationship, quality, can, be, negatively, affected, unsupportive, policy, environments, such, as, same, sex, marriage, bans, have, a, negative, impact, on, well, being, while, being, out, as, a, couple, and, living, in, a, place, with, legal, same, sex, relationship, recognition, have, a, positive, impact, on, individual, and, couple, well, being, some, asexual, people, engage, in, intimate, relationships, that, are, solely, emotionally, intimate, but, other, asexual, people, s, relationships, involve, sex, as, part, of, negotiations, with, non, asexual, partners, a, 2019, study, of, sexual, minority, individuals, in, the, united, states, found, that, while, asexual, individuals, were, less, likely, to, have, recently, had, sex, they, did, not, differ, from, non, asexual, participants, in, rates, of, being, in, an, intimate, relationship, asexual, individuals, face, stigma, and, the, pathologization, of, their, sexual, orientation, and, report, difficulty, navigating, assumptions, about, sexuality, in, the, dating, scene,
