the, basic, elements, of, vegan, food, since, ancient, times, individuals, have, been, renouncing, the, consumption, of, products, of, animal, origin, but, the, term, veganism, is, modern, it, was, coined, in, 1944, by, donald, watson, with, the, aim, of, differentiating, it, from, vegetarianism, which, rejects, the, consumption, of, meat, but, accepts, the, consumption, of, other, products, of, animal, origin, such, as, milk, dairy, products, and, eggs, interest, in, veganism, increased, significantly, in, the, 2010s, groups, ideas, related, vegetarianism, can, be, traced, back, to, the, indus, valley, civilization, in, 3300, 1300, bce, in, the, indian, subcontinent, particularly, in, northern, and, western, ancient, india, early, vegetarians, included, indian, philosophers, such, as,

plutarch, plotinus, and, porphyry, and, the, roman, poet, ovid, and, the, playwright, seneca, the, younger, the, greek, sage, pythagoras, may, have, advocated, an, early, form, of, strict, vegetarianism, but, his, life, is, so, obscure, that, it, is, disputed, whether, he, ever, advocated, any, form, of, vegetarianism, he, almost, certainly, prohibited, his, followers, from, eating, beans, and, wearing, woolen, garments, eudoxus, of, cnidus, a, student, of, archytas, and, plato, writes, pythagoras, was, distinguished, by, such, purity, and, so, avoided, killing, and, killers, that, he, not, only, abstained, from, animal, foods, but, even, kept, his, distance, from, cooks, and, hunters, one, of, the, earliest, known, vegans, was, the, arab, poet, al, ma, arri, famous, for, his, poem, i, no, longer, steal, from, nature, c, 973, c, 1057, their, arguments, were, based, on, health, the, transmigration, of, souls, animal, welfare, and, the, view, espoused, by, porphyry, in, de, abstinentia, ab, esu, animalium, on, abstinence, from, animal, food, c, 268, c, 270, that, if, humans, deserve, justice, then, so, do, animals, vegetarianism, established, itself, as, a, significant, movement, in, 19th, century, britain, and, the, united, states, a, minority, of, vegetarians, avoided, animal, food, entirely, in, 1813, the, poet, percy, bysshe, shelley, published, a, vindication, of, natural, diet, advocating, abstinence, from, animal, food, and, spirituous, liquors, and, in, 1815, william, lambe, a, london, physician, said, that, his, water, and, vegetable, diet, could, cure, anything, from, tuberculosis, to, acne, lambe, called, animal, food, a, habitual, irritation, and, argued, that, milk, eating, and, flesh, eating, are, but, branches, of, a, common, system, and, they, must, stand, or, fall, together, sylvester, graham, s, meatless, graham, diet, mostly, fruit, vegetables, water, and, bread, made, at, home, with, stoneground, flour, became, popular, as, a, health, remedy, in, the, 1830s, in, the, united, states, the, first, known, vegan, cookbook, was, asenath, nicholson, s, kitchen, philosophy, for, vegetarians, published, in, 1849, several, vegan, communities, were, established, around, this, time, in, massachusetts, amos, bronson, alcott, father, of, the, novelist, louisa, may, alcott, opened, the, temple, school, in, 1834, and, fruitlands, in, 1844, and, in, england, james, pierrepont, greaves, founded, the, concordium, a, vegan, community, at, alcott, house, on, ham, common, in, 1838, the, term, vegetarian, has, been, in, use, since, around, 1839, to, refer, to, what, was, previously, called, a, vegetable, regimen, or, diet, its, origin, is, an, irregular, compound, of, vegetable, and, the, suffix, arian, in, the, sense, of, supporter, believer, as, in, humanitarian, the, earliest, known, written, use, is, attributed, to, actress, writer, and, abolitionist, fanny, kemble, in, her, journal, of, a, residence, on, a, georgian, plantation, in, 1838, 1839, in, 1843, members, of, alcott, house, created, the, british, and, foreign, society, for, the, promotion, of, humanity, and, abstinence, from, animal, food, led, by, sophia, chichester, a, wealthy, benefactor, of, alcott, house, alcott, house, also, helped, to, establish, the, british, vegetarian, society, which, held, its, first, meeting, in, 1847, in, ramsgate, kent, the, medical, times, and, gazette, in, london, reported, in, 1884, there, are, two, kinds, of, vegetarians, one, an, extreme, form, the, members, of, which, eat, no, animal, food, products, what, so, ever, and, a, less, extreme, sect, who, do, not, object, to, eggs, milk, or, fish, the, vegetarian, society, belongs, to, the, latter, more, moderate, division, an, article, in, the, society, s, magazine, the, vegetarian, messenger, in, 1851, discussed, alternatives, to, shoe, leather, which, suggests, the, presence, of, vegans, within, the, membership, who, rejected, animal, use, entirely, not, only, in, diet, henry, s, salt, s, 1886, a, plea, for, vegetarianism, and, other, essays, asserts, it, is, quite, true, that, most, not, all, food, reformers, admit, into, their, diet, such, animal, food, as, milk, butter, cheese, and, eggs, salt, also, argued, that, the, primary, objective, of, the, vegetarian, movement, should, be, to, eliminate, meat, while, contending, that, dairy, and, eggs, are, also, unnecessary, and, could, be, phased, out, over, time, c, w, daniel, published, an, early, vegan, cookbook, rupert, h, wheldon, s, no, animal, food, two, essays, and, 100, recipes, in, 1910, the, consumption, of, milk, and, eggs, became, a, battleground, over, the, following, decades, there, were, regular, discussions, about, it, in, the, vegetarian, messenger, it, appears, from, the, correspondence, pages, that, many, opponents, of, veganism, were, vegetarians, during, a, visit, to, london, in, 1931, mahatma, gandhi, who, had, joined, the, london, vegetarian, society, s, executive, committee, when, he, lived, in, london, from, 1888, to, 1891, gave, a, speech, to, the, society, arguing, that, it, ought, to, promote, a, meat, free, diet, as, a, matter, of, morality, not, health, lacto, vegetarians, acknowledged, the, ethical, consistency, of, the, vegan, position, but, regarded, a, vegan, diet, as, impracticable, and, were, concerned, that, it, might, be, an, impediment, to, spreading, vegetarianism, if, vegans, found, themselves, unable, to, participate, in, social, circles, where, no, non, animal, food, was, available, this, became, the, predominant, view, of, the, vegetarian, society, which, in, 1935, stated, the, lacto, vegetarians, on, the, whole, do, not, defend, the, practice, of, consuming, the, dairy, products, except, on, the, ground, of, expediency, in, august, 1944, several, members, of, the, vegetarian, society, asked, that, a, section, of, its, newsletter, be, devoted, to, non, dairy, vegetarianism, when, the, request, was, denied, donald, watson, secretary, of, the, leicester, branch, set, up, a, new, quarterly, newsletter, the, vegan, news, in, november, 1944, priced, tuppence, the, word, vegan, was, invented, by, watson, and, dorothy, morgan, a, schoolteacher, he, later, married, the, word, is, based, on, the, first, three, and, last, two, letters, of, vegetarian, because, it, marked, in, watson, s, words, the, beginning, and, end, of, vegetarian, the, vegan, news, asked, its, readers, if, they, could, think, of, anything, better, than, vegan, to, stand, for, non, dairy, vegetarian, they, suggested, allvega, neo, vegetarian, dairyban, vitan, benevore, sanivores, and, beaumangeur, according, to, joanne, stepaniak, the, word, vegan, was, first, published, independently, in, 1962, by, the, oxford, illustrated, dictionary, defined, as, a, vegetarian, who, eats, no, butter, eggs, cheese, or, milk, the, first, edition, of, the, vegan, news, attracted, more, than, 100, letters, including, from, george, bernard, shaw, who, resolved, to, give, up, eggs, and, dairy, the, vegan, society, held, its, first, meeting, in, early, november, at, the, attic, club, 144, high, holborn, london, in,

name, to, the, vegan, in, november, 1945, by, which, time, it, had, 500, subscribers, it, published, recipes, and, a, vegan, trade, list, of, animal, free, products, such, as, toothpastes, shoe, polishes, stationery, and, glue, vegan, books, appeared, including, vegan, recipes, by, fay, k, henderson, 1946, and, aids, to, a, vegan, diet, for, children, by, kathleen, v, mayo, 1948, the, vegan, society, soon, made, clear, that, it, rejected, the, use, of, animals, for, any, purpose, not, only, in, diet, in, 1947, watson, wrote, the, vegan, renounces, it, as, superstitious, that, human, life, depends, upon, the, exploitation, of, these, creatures, whose, feelings, are, much, the, same, as, our, own, from, 1948, the, vegan, s, front, page, read, advocating, living, without, exploitation, and, in, 1951, the, society, published, its, definition, of, veganism, as, the, doctrine, that, man, should, live, without, exploiting, animals, in, 1956, its, vice, president, leslie, cross, founded, the, plantmilk, society, and, in, 1965, as, plantmilk, ltd, and, later, plamil, foods, it, began, production, of, one, of, the, first, widely, distributed, soy, milks, in, the, western, world, the, first, vegan, society, in, the, u, s, was, founded, in, 1948, by, catherine, nimmo, and, rubin, abramowitz, in, california, who, distributed, watson, s, newsletter, in, 1960, h, jay, dinshah, founded, the, american, vegan, society, avs, linking, veganism, to, the, concept, of, ahimsa, non, harming, in, sanskrit, distinctions, may, be, made, between, several, categories, of, veganism, dietary, vegans, also, known, as, strict, vegetarians, refrain, from, consuming, meat, eggs, dairy, products, and, any, other, animal, derived, substances, an, ethical, vegan, is, someone, who, not, only, excludes, animal, products, from, their, diet, but, also, tries, to, avoid, using, animals, animal, products, and, animal, tested, products, when, practical, another, term, is, environmental, veganism, which, refers, to, the, avoidance, of, animal, products, on, the, grounds, that, the, industrial, farming, of, animals, is, environmentally, damaging, and, unsustainable, another, motivation, for, veganism, is, concern, about, animal, welfare, since, 1988, the, vegan, society, gives, two, definitions, of, veganism, veganism, is, a, philosophy, and, way, of, living, which, seeks, to, exclude, as, far, as, is, possible, and, practicable, all, forms, of, exploitation, of, and, cruelty, to, animals, for, food, clothing, or, any, other, purpose, and, by, extension, promotes, the, development, and, use, of, animal, free, alternatives, for, the, benefit, of, animals, humans, and, the, environment, in, dietary, terms, it, denotes, the, practice, of, dispensing, with, all, products, derived, wholly, or, partly, from, animals, the, first, definition, by, the, vegan, society, is, accepted, among, ethical, and, environmental, vegans, and, the, second,

the, united, states, that, focused, on, concerns, about, diet, the, environment, and, a, distrust, of, food, producers, leading, to, increasing, interest, in, organic, gardening, one, of, the, most,

in, 2016, when, it, became, known, that, the, uk, s, newly, introduced, 5, note, contained, tallow, like, vegetarians, vegans, do, not, eat, meat, including, beef, pork, poultry, fowl, and, game, vegan, groups, disagree, over, whether, vegans, can, eat, oysters, many, clothing, products, may, be, made, of, animal, products, such, as, silk, wool, including, lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair, and, a, number, of, other, fine, wools, fur, feathers, pearls, animal, derived, dyes, leather, snakeskin, or, other, kinds, of, skin, or, animal, product, most, leather, clothing, is, made, from, cow, skins, vegans, discourage, the, use, of, leather, but, may, continue, to, wear, leather, they, bought, before, adopting, the, diet, on, the, grounds, that, they, are, not, financially, supporting, the, meat, industry, however, vegans, try, to, work, towards, a, point, where, they, no, longer, own, animal, products, the, word, was, coined, in, britain, by, dorothy, morgan, and, donald, watson, ethical, vegans, may, wear, clothing, items, and, accessories, made, of, non, animal, derived, materials, such, as, hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, artificial, leather, pleather, rubber, and, vinyl, 16, leather, alternatives, can, come, from, materials, such, as, cork, pi, a, from, pineapples, cactus, and, mushroom, leather, some, vegan, clothes, in, particular, leather, alternatives, are, made, of, petroleum, based, products, which, has, triggered, criticism, because, of, the, environmental, damage, involved, in, their, production, while, dietary, vegans, might, use, animal, products, in, toiletries, ethical, veganism, extends, not, only, to, matters, of, food, but, also, to, the, use, of, animal, products, and, rejects, the, commodification, of, animals, altogether, 62, ethical, vegans, replace, personal, care, products, and, household, cleaners, containing, animal, products, with, vegan, products, animal, ingredients, are, ubiquitous, because, they, are, relatively, inexpensive, after, animals, are, slaughtered, for, meat, the, leftovers, are, put, through, a, rendering, process, and, some, of, that, material, particularly, the, fat, is, used, in, toiletries, vegans, also, avoid, using, sea, sponges, common, animal, derived, ingredients, include, tallow, in, soap, collagen, derived, glycerine, which, used, as, a, lubricant, and, humectant, in, many, haircare, products, moisturizers, shaving, foams, soaps, and, toothpastes, lanolin, from, sheep, s, wool, often, found, in, lip, balm, and, moisturizers, stearic, acid, a, common, ingredient, in, face, creams, shaving, foam, and, shampoos, like, glycerine, it, can, be, plant, based, but, is, usually, animal, derived, lactic, acid, an, alpha, hydroxy, acid, derived, from, animal, milk, used, in, moisturizers, allantoin, from, the, comfrey, plant, or, cow, urine, found, in, shampoos, moisturizers, and, toothpaste, and, carmine, from, scale, insects, such, as, the, female, cochineal, used, in, food, and, cosmetics, to, produce, red, and, pink, shades, beauty, without, cruelty, founded, as, a, charity, in, 1959, was, one, of, the, earliest, manufacturers, and, certifiers, of, animal, free, personal, care, products, hair, extensions, are, generally, avoided, by, ethical, vegans, since, they, are, made, from, human, hair, but, ethical, vegans, may, use, synthetic, alternatives, environmental, vegans, avoid, synthetic, hair, extensions, due, to, their, biodegradability, vegan, groups, disagree, about, insect, products, neither, the, vegan, society, nor, the, american, vegan, society, considers, honey, silk, and, other, insect, products, suitable, for, vegans, some, vegans, believe, that, exploiting, the, labor, of, bees, and, harvesting, their, energy, source, is, immoral, and, that, commercial, beekeeping, operations, can, harm, and, even, kill, bees, insect, products, can, be, defined, much, more, widely, as, commercial, bees, are, used, to, pollinate, about, 100, different, food, crops, some, environmental, vegans, do, not, use, meat, based, pet, food, to, feed, their, pets, due, to, its, environmental, impact, and, ethical, vegans, do, not, use, meat, based, pet, food, this, is, particularly, true, for, domesticated, cats, and, dogs, for, which, vegan, pet, food, is, available, this, practice, has, been, met, with, caution, and, criticism, especially, regarding, vegan, cat, diets, because, unlike, omnivorous, dogs, felids, are, obligate, carnivores, a, 2015, study, found, that, 6, out, of, 24, commercial, vegan, pet, food, brands, do, not, meet, the, association, of, american, feed, control, officials, aafco, labeling, regulations, for, amino, acid, adequacy, a, 2023, systematic, review, found, no, evidence, of, considerable, effects, on, health, however, it, was, pointed, out, that, there, were, issues, with, selection, bias, studies, not, being, long, term, and, low, sample, sizes, and, recommended, larger, scale, studies, a, concern, is, the, case, of, medications, which, are, routinely, tested, on, animals, to, ensure, they, are, effective, and, safe, and, may, also, contain, animal, ingredients, such, as, lactose, gelatine, or, stearates, there, may, be, no, alternatives, to, prescribed, medication, or, these, alternatives, may, be, unsuitable, less, effective, or, have, more, adverse, side, effects, experimentation, with, laboratory, animals, is, also, used, for, evaluating, the, safety, of, vaccines, food, additives, cosmetics, household, products, workplace, chemicals, and, many, other, substances, vegans, may, avoid, certain, vaccines, such, as, the, flu, vaccine, which, is, commonly, produced, in, chicken, eggs, an, effective, alternative, flublok, is, widely, available, in, the, united, states, farming, of, fruits, and, vegetables, may, include, fertilizing, the, soil, with, animal, manure, even, on, organic, farms, possibly, causing, a, concern, to, vegans, for, ethical, or, environmental, reasons, vegan, or, animal, free, farming, uses, plant, compost, only, vegans, oppose, the, use, of, animals, for, any, purpose, including, food, clothing, toiletries, testing, and, places, that, use, animals, for, entertainment, vegans, oppose, horseback, riding, on, the, basis, that, it, is, unnecessary, and, exploitative, while, the, vegan, society, acknowledges, that, there, are, ways, to, minimize, cruelty, in, breaking, a, horse, they, believe, that, the, fact, that, horses, need, to, be, broken, at, all, shows, that, horses, do, not, naturally, expect, to, be, ridden, the, vegan, society, also, points, out, that, in, the, modern, age, horseback, riding, is, a, hobby, rather, than, a, legitimate, means, of, transportation, vegans, avoid, visiting, zoos, and, aquariums, on, the, belief, that, they, exploit, animals, for, entertainment, some, vegans, may, visit, animal, sanctuaries, as, an, alternative, vegans, do, not, purchase, pets, but, may, adopt, or, rescue, a, domestic, animal, that, cannot, live, independently, vegans, do, not, keep, exotic, pets, such, as, birds, tortoises, and, fish, believing, that, because, they, have, not, been, domesticated, they, do, not, belong, in, captivity, conclusions, in, scientific, review, articles, range, from, stating, benefits, to, concluding, that, evidence, is, not, yet, sufficient, to, identifying, possible, health, problems, one, review, reported, moderate, evidence, that, adhering, to, a, vegan, diet, for, at, least, 12, weeks, may, be, effective, in, individuals, with, overweight, or, type, 2, diabetes, to, induce, a, meaningful, decrease, in, body, weight, and, improve, glycemia, a, second, reported, that, vegetarian, diets, including, vegan, diets, are, associated, with, lower, risk, for, vascular, disease, obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and, type, 2, diabetes, a, third, indicated, that, a, vegan, diet, may, be, effective, for, reducing, body, weight, lowering, the, risk, of, cancer, and, providing, a, lower, risk, of, all, cause, mortality, people, on, a, vegan, diet, with, diabetes, or, cardiovascular, diseases, may, have, lower, levels, of, disease, biomarkers, a, cochrane, review, of, randomized, controlled, trials, found, that, there, is, currently, insufficient, information, to, draw, conclusions, about, the, effects, of, vegan, dietary, interventions, on, cardiovascular, disease, risk, factors, there, is, inconsistent, evidence, for, vegan, diets, providing, an, effect, on, metabolic, syndrome, a, meta, analysis, of, prospective, cohort, studies, concluded, that, vegan, diets, are, associated, with, reduced, risk, of, ischemic, heart, disease, but, no, clear, association, was, found, for, cardiovascular, disease, and, stroke, there, is, tentative, evidence, of, an, association, between, vegan, diets, and, reduced, risk, of, cancer, vegans, may, be, at, risk, of, low, bone, mineral, density, the, academy, of, nutrition, and, dietetics, and, dietitians, of, canada, say, that, properly, planned, vegetarian, or, vegan, diets, are, appropriate, for, all, life, stages, including, pregnancy, and, lactation, the, australian, national, health, and, medical, research, council, similarly, recognizes, a, well, planned, vegan, diet, as, viable, for, any, age, as, does, the, british, dietetic, association, british, national, health, service, and, the, canadian, pediatric, society, as, of, 2024, the, german, society, for, nutrition, dge, holds, that, for, healthy, adults, a, vegan, diet, can, be, healthful, when, b, 12, is, supplemented, and, the, diet, is, well, planned, so, that, critical, nutrients, are, provided, because, data, is, lacking, the, dge, does, not, recommend, for, or, against, vegan, diets, for, vulnerable, groups, like, children, young, people, elderly, and, pregnant, or, breastfeeding, women, if, individuals, in, these, groups, decide, for, a, vegan, diet, they, are, suggested, to, seek, professional, advice, as, planning, the, diet, in, these, cases, is, complex, and, irreversible, consequences, cannot, be, ruled, out, when, the, diet, is, not, well, planned, the, dge, highlights, that, a, vegan, diet, is, exceptionally, environmental, friendly, and, can, reduce, greenhouse, cases, by, about, 70, 80, while, having, other, environmental, benefits, too, as, of, 2022, 45, of, government, nutritional, guidelines, discuss, vegan, meat, or, milk, alternatives, or, both, the, academy, of, nutrition, and, dietetics, consider, well, planned, vegetarian, and, vegan, diets, appropriate, for, all, stages, of, the, life, cycle, including, pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, adolescence, older, adulthood, and, for, athletes, the, german, society, for, nutrition, cautioned, against, a, vegan, diet, for, pregnant, women, breastfeeding, women, babies, children, and, adolescents, the, position, of, the, canadian, pediatric, society, is, that, well, planned, vegetarian, and, vegan, diets, with, appropriate, attention, to, specific, nutrient, components, can, provide, a, healthy, alternative, lifestyle, at, all, stages, of, fetal, infant, child, and, adolescent, growth, it, is, recommended, that, attention, should, be, given, to, nutrient, intake, particularly, protein, vitamins, b, 12, and, d, essential, fatty, acids, iron, zinc, and, calcium, vegan, diets, tend, to, be, higher, in, dietary, fiber, magnesium, folic, acid, vitamin, c, vitamin, e, iron, and, phytochemicals, and, lower, in, dietary, energy, saturated, fat, cholesterol, omega, 3, fatty, acid, vitamin, d, calcium, zinc, and, vitamin, b, 12, as, a, result, of, the, elimination, of, all, animal, products, a, poorly, planned, vegan, diet, can, lead, to, nutritional, deficiencies, that, counteract, its, beneficial, effects, and, cause, serious, health, issues, some, of, which, can, only, be, prevented, with, fortified, foods, or, dietary, supplements, vitamin, b, 12, supplementation, is, important, because, its, deficiency, can, cause, blood, disorders, and, potentially, irreversible, neurological, damage, this, danger, is, also, one, of, the, most, common, in, poorly, planned, non, vegan, diets, the, american, academy, of, nutrition, and, dietetics, states, that, special, attention, may, be, necessary, to, ensure, that, a, vegan, diet, provides, adequate, amounts, of, vitamin, b, 12, omega, 3, fatty, acids, vitamin, d, calcium, iodine, iron, and, zinc, it, also, states, that, concern, that, vegans, and, vegan, athletes, may, not, consume, an, adequate, amount, and, quality, of, protein, is, unsubstantiated, these, nutrients, are, available, in, plant, foods, with, the, exception, of, vitamin, b, 12, which, can, be, obtained, only, from, b, 12, fortified, vegan, foods, or, supplements, vitamin, b, 12, deficiency, occurs, in, up, to, 80, of, all, vegans, in, some, asian, countries, iodine, may, also, require, supplementation, such, as, using, iodized, salt, ethical, veganism, is, based, on, opposition, to, speciesism, the, assignment, of, value, to, individuals, based, on, animal, species, membership, alone, divisions, within, animal, rights, theory, include, the, utilitarian, protectionist, approach, which, pursues, improved, conditions, for, animals, it, also, pertains, to, the, rights, based, abolitionism, which, seeks, to, end, human, ownership, of, non, humans, abolitionists, argue, that, protectionism, serves, only, to, make, the, public, feel, that, animal, use, can, be, morally, unproblematic, the, happy, meat, position, 62, 63, donald, watson, co, founder, of, the, vegan, society, asked, why, he, was, an, ethical, vegan, replied, if, an, open, minded, honest, person, pursues, a, course, long, enough, and, listens, to, all, the, criticisms, and, in, one, s, own, mind, can, satisfactorily, meet, all, the, criticisms, against, that, idea, sooner, or, later, one, s, resistance, against, what, one, sees, as, evil, tradition, has, to, be, discarded, of, bloodsports, he, has, said, that, to, kill, creatures, for, fun, must, be, the, very, dregs, and, that, vivisection, and, animal, experimentation, is, probably, the, cruelest, of, all, man, s, attack, on, the, rest, of, creation, he, has, also, said, vegetarianism, whilst, being, a, necessary, stepping, stone, between, meat, eating, and, veganism, is, only, a, stepping, stone, alex, hershaft, co, founder, of, the, farm, animal, rights, movement, and, holocaust, survivor, says, he, was, always, bothered, by, the, idea, of, hitting, a, beautiful, living, innocent, animal, over, the, head, cutting, him, up, into, pieces, then, shoving, the, pieces, into, mouth, and, that, his, experiences, in, the, nazi, holocaust, allowed, him, to, empathize, with, the, conditions, of, animals, in, factory, farms, auction, yards, and, slaughterhouses, because, he, knows, firsthand, what, it, s, like, to, be, treated, like, a, worthless, object, several, animal, rights, activists, including, isaac, bashevis, singer, gary, yourofsky, and, karen, davis, have, compared, the, cruel, treatment, of, animals, in, cafos, and, slaughterhouses, to, the, holocaust, law, professor, gary, francione, an, abolitionist, argues, that, all, sentient, beings, should, have, the, right, not, to, be, treated, as, property, and, that, veganism, must, be, the, baseline, for, anyone, who, believes, that, non, humans, have, intrinsic, moral, value, 62, philosopher, tom, regan, also, a, rights, theorist, argues, that, animals, possess, value, as, subjects, of, a, life, because, they, have, beliefs, desires, memory, and, the, ability, to, initiate, action, in, pursuit, of, goals, the, right, of, subjects, of, a, life, not, to, be, harmed, can, be, overridden, by, other, moral, principles, but, regan, argues, that, pleasure, convenience, and, the, economic, interests, of, farmers, are, not, weighty, enough, philosopher, peter, singer, a, protectionist, and, utilitarian, argues, that, there, is, no, moral, or, logical, justification, for, failing, to, count, animal, suffering, as, a, consequence, when, making, decisions, and, that, killing, animals, should, be, rejected, unless, necessary, for, survival, despite, this, he, writes, that, ethical, thinking, can, be, sensitive, to, circumstances, and, that, he, is, not, too, concerned, about, trivial, infractions, an, argument, by, bruce, friedrich, also, a, protectionist, holds, that, strict, veganism, harms, animals, because, it, focuses, on, personal, purity, rather, than, encouraging, people, to, give, up, whatever, animal, products, they, can, for, francione, this, is, similar, to, arguing, that, because, human, rights, abuses, can, never, be, eliminated, we, should, not, defend, human, rights, in, situations, we, control, by, failing, to, ask, a, server, whether, something, contains, animal, products, we, reinforce, that, the, moral, rights, of, animals, are, a, matter, of, convenience, he, argues, he, concludes, from, this, that, the, protectionist, position, fails, on, its, own, consequentialist, terms, 72, 73, philosopher, val, plumwood, maintained, that, ethical, veganism, is, subtly, human, centred, an, example, of, what, she, called, human, nature, dualism, because, it, views, humanity, as, separate, from, the, rest, of, nature, ethical, vegans, want, to, admit, non, humans, into, the, category, that, deserves, special, protection, rather, than, recognize, the, ecological, embeddedness, of, all, plumwood, wrote, that, animal, food, may, be, an, unnecessary, evil, from, the, perspective, of, the, consumer, who, draws, on, the, whole, planet, for, nutritional, needs, and, she, strongly, opposed, factory, farming, but, for, anyone, relying, on, a, much, smaller, ecosystem, it, is, very, difficult, or, impossible, to, be, vegan, bioethicist, ben, mepham, in, his, review, of, francione, and, garner, s, book, the, animal, rights, debate, abolition, or, regulation, concludes, if, the, aim, of, ethics, is, to, choose, the, right, or, best, course, of, action, in, specific, circumstances, all, things, considered, it, is, arguable, that, adherence, to, such, an, absolutist, agenda, is, simplistic, and, open, to, serious, self, contradictions, or, as, farlie, puts, it, with, characteristic, panache, to, conclude, that, veganism, is, the, only, ethical, response, is, to, take, a, big, leap, into, a, very, muddy, pond, he, cites, as, examples, the, adverse, effects, on, animal, wildlife, derived, from, the, agricultural, practices, necessary, to, sustain, most, vegan, diets, and, the, ethical, contradiction, of, favoring, the, welfare, of, domesticated, animals, but, not, that, of, wild, animals, the, imbalance, between, the, resources, that, are, used, to, promote, the, welfare, of, animals, as, opposed, to, those, destined, to, alleviate, the, suffering, of, the, approximately, one, billion, human, beings, who, undergo, malnutrition, abuse, and, exploitation, the, focus, on, attitudes, and, conditions, in, western, developed, countries, leaving, out, the, rights, and, interests, of, societies, whose, economy, culture, and, in, some, cases, survival, rely, on, a, symbiotic, relationship, with, animals, david, pearce, a, transhumanist, philosopher, has, argued, that, humanity, has, a, hedonistic, imperative, not, merely, to, avoid, cruelty, to, animals, caused, by, humans, but, also, to, redesign, the, global, ecosystem, such, that, wild, animal, suffering, in, nature, ceases, to, exist, in, pursuit, of, abolishing, suffering, pearce, promotes, predation, elimination, among, animals, and, the, cross, species, global, analogue, of, the, welfare, state, fertility, regulation, could, maintain, herbivore, populations, at, sustainable, levels, a, more, civilised, and, compassionate, policy, option, than, famine, predation, and, disease, the, increasing, number, of, vegans, and, vegetarians, in, the, transhumanism, movement, has, been, attributed, in, part, to, pearce, s, influence, a, growing, political, philosophy, that, incorporates, veganism, as, part, of, its, revolutionary, praxis, is, veganarchism, which, seeks, total, abolition, or, total, liberation, for, all, animals, including, humans, veganarchists, identify, the, state, as, unnecessary, and, harmful, to, animals, both, human, and, non, human, and, advocate, for, the, adoption, of, veganism, in, a, stateless, society, the, term, was, popularized, in, 1995, by, brian, a, dominick, s, pamphlet, animal, liberation, and, social, revolution, described, as, a, vegan, perspective, on, anarchism, or, an, anarchist, perspective, on, veganism, direct, action, is, a, common, practice, among, veganarchists, and, anarchists, generally, with, groups, like, the, animal, liberation, front, alf, the, animal, rights, militia, arm, the, justice, department, jd, and, revolutionary, cells, animal, liberation, brigade, rcalb, often, engaging, in, such, activities, sometimes, criminally, to, further, their, goals, steven, best, animal, rights, activist, and, professor, of, philosophy, at, the, university, of, texas, at, el, paso, advocates, this, approach, and, has, been, critical, of, vegan, activists, like, francione, for, supporting, animal, liberation, but, not, total, liberation, which, would, include, not, only, opposition, to, the, property, status, of, animals, but, also, a, serious, critique, of, capitalism, the, state, property, relations, and, commodification, dynamics, in, general, in, particular, he, criticizes, the, focus, on, the, simplistic, and, apolitical, go, vegan, message, directed, mainly, at, wealthy, western, audiences, while, ignoring, people, of, color, the, working, class, and, the, poor, especially, in, the, developing, world, noting, that, for, every, person, who, becomes, vegan, a, thousand, flesh, eaters, arise, in, china, india, and, indonesia, the, faith, in, the, singular, efficacy, of, conjectural, education, and, moral, persuasion, best, writes, is, no, substitute, for, direct, action, mass, confrontation, civil, disobedience, alliance, politics, and, struggle, for, radical, change, donald, watson, has, said, he, respects, the, people, enormously, who, do, it, believing, that, it, s, the, most, direct, and, quick, way, to, achieve, their, ends, sociologist, david, nibert, of, wittenberg, university, posits, that, any, movement, towards, global, justice, would, necessitate, not, only, the, abolition, of, animal, exploitation, particularly, as, a, food, source, for, humans, but, also, transitioning, towards, a, socioeconomic, alternative, to, the, capitalist, system, both, of, which, dovetail, into, what, he, calls, the, animal, industrial, complex, some, vegans, also, embrace, the, philosophy, of, anti, natalism, as, they, see, the, two, as, complementary, in, terms, of, harm, reduction, to, animals, and, the, environment, vegan, social, psychologist, melanie, joy, described, the, ideology, in, which, people, support, the, use, and, consumption, of, animal, products, as, carnism, as, a, sort, of, opposite, to, veganism, the, vegan, society, has, written, by, extension, promotes, the, development, and, use, of, animal, free, alternatives, for, the, benefit, of, humans, many, ethical, vegans, and, vegan, organizations, cite, the, poor, working, conditions, of, slaughterhouse, workers, as, a, reason, to, reject, animal, products, the, first, vegan, activist, donald, watson, has, asked, if, these, butchers, and, vivisectors, weren, t, there, could, we, perform, the, acts, that, they, are, doing, and, if, we, couldn, t, we, have, no, right, to, expect, them, to, do, it, on, our, behalf, full, stop, that, simply, compounds, the, issue, it, means, that, we, re, not, just, exploiting, animals, we, re, exploiting, human, beings, some, people, follow, a, vegan, diet, but, not, other, aspects, of, veganism, dietary, veganism, is, limited, to, following, a, plant, based, diet, dietary, veganism, is, in, contrast, to, ethical, veganism, which, is, defined, as, a, philosophical, belief, that, is, a, protected, characteristic, under, the, uk, s, equality, act, 2010, authors, like, richard, twine, and, breeze, harper, argue, that, dietary, veganism, cannot, be, called, veganism, as, veganism, is, more, than, a, diet, gary, l, francione, has, argued, that, the, promotion, of, dietary, veganism, lacks, the, moral, imperative, expressed, by, leslie, j, cross, an, early, and, influential, vice, president, of, the, vegan, society, who, said, in, 1949, that, veganism, was, the, abolition, of, the, exploitation, of, animals, by, man, the, vegan, society, of, canada, have, criticized, dietary, veganism, stating, since, veganism, is, not, a, list, of, ingredients, there, is, also, no, such, thing, as, a, dietary, vegan, veganism, cannot, be, split, into, sub, components, this, is, a, case, where, the, whole, is, greater, than, the, sum, of, its, parts, others, have, suggested, that, the, arguments, for, dietary, veganism, can, be, extended, to, support, ethical, veganism, environmental, vegans, focus, on, conservation, rejecting, the, use, of, animal, products, on, the, premise, that, fishing, hunting, trapping, and, farming, particularly, factory, farming, are, environmentally, unsustainable, according, to, a, 2006, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, report, livestock, s, long, shadow, around, 26, of, the, planet, s, terrestrial, surface, is, devoted, to, livestock, grazing, the, report, also, concluded, that, livestock, farming, mostly, of, cows, chickens, and, pigs, affects, the, air, land, soil, water, biodiversity, and, climate, change, livestock, consumed, 1, 174, million, tonnes, of, food, in, 2002, including, 7, 6, million, tonnes, of, fishmeal, and, 670, million, tonnes, of, cereals, one, third, of, the, global, cereal, harvest, paul, watson, of, the, sea, shepherd, conservation, society, called, pigs, and, chicken, major, aquatic, predators, because, livestock, eat, 40, percent, of, the, fish, that, are, caught, a, 2010, un, report, assessing, the, environmental, impacts, of, consumption, and, production, argued, that, animal, products, in, general, require, more, resources, and, cause, higher, emissions, than, plant, based, alternatives, 80, it, proposed, a, move, away, from, animal, products, to, reduce, environmental, damage, a, 2015, study, determined, that, significant, biodiversity, loss, can, be, attributed, to, the, growing, demand, for, meat, a, significant, driver, of, deforestation, and, habitat, destruction, with, species, rich, habitats, converted, to, agriculture, for, livestock, production, a, 2017, world, wildlife, fund, study, found, that, 60, of, biodiversity, loss, can, be, attributed, to, the, vast, scale, of, feed, crop, cultivation, needed, to, rear, tens, of, billions, of, farm, animals, which, puts, enormous, strain, on, natural, resources, resulting, in, extensive, loss, of, lands, and, species, in, 2017, 15, 364, world, scientists, signed, a, warning, to, humanity, calling, for, among, other, things, promoting, dietary, shifts, towards, mostly, plant, based, foods, a, 2018, study, found, that, global, adoption, of, plant, based, diets, would, reduce, agricultural, land, use, by, 76, 3, 1, billion, hectares, an, area, the, size, of, africa, and, cut, total, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, by, 28, half, of, this, emissions, reduction, came, from, avoided, emissions, from, animal, production, including, methane, and, nitrous, oxide, and, half, from, trees, re, growing, on, abandoned, farmlands, that, remove, carbon, dioxide, from, the, air, the, authors, conclude, that, avoiding, meat, and, dairy, is, the, single, biggest, way, to, reduce, one, s, impact, on, earth, the, 2019, ipbes, global, assessment, report, on, biodiversity, and, ecosystem, services, found, that, industrial, agriculture, and, overfishing, are, the, primary, drivers, of, the, extinction, crisis, with, the, meat, and, dairy, industries, having, a, substantial, impact, on, 8, august, 2019, the, ipcc, released, a, summary, of, the, 2019, special, report, which, asserted, that, a, shift, towards, plant, based, diets, would, help, to, mitigate, and, adapt, to, climate, change, a, 2022, study, found, that, for, high, income, nations, alone, 100, billion, tons, of, carbon, dioxide, could, be, removed, from, the, air, by, the, end, of, the, century, through, a, shift, to, plant, based, diets, and, re, wilding, of, farmlands, the, researchers, coined, the, term, double, climate, dividend, to, describe, the, effect, that, re, wilding, after, a, diet, shift, can, have, but, they, note, we, don, t, have, to, be, purist, about, this, even, just, cutting, animal, intake, would, be, helpful, if, half, of, the, public, in, richer, regions, cut, half, the, animal, products, in, their, diets, you, re, still, talking, about, a, massive, opportunity, in, environmental, outcomes, and, public, health, a, 2023, study, published, in, nature, food, found, that, a, vegan, diet, vastly, decreases, the, impact, on, the, environment, from, food, production, such, as, reducing, emissions, water, pollution, and, land, use, by, 75, reducing, the, destruction, of, wildlife, by, 66, and, the, usage, of, water, by, 54, one, leading, activist, and, scholar, of, feminist, animal, rights, is, carol, j, adams, her, premier, work, the, sexual, politics, of, meat, a, feminist, vegetarian, critical, theory, 1990, noted, the, relationship, between, feminism, and, meat, consumption, since, its, release, adams, has, published, several, other, works, including, essays, books, and, keynote, addresses, in, one, of, her, speeches, why, feminist, vegan, now, adapted, from, her, original, address, at, the, minding, animals, conference, in, newcastle, australia, 2009, she, said, the, idea, that, there, was, a, connection, between, feminism, and, vegetarianism, came, to, in, october, 1974, other, authors, have, echoed, adams, s, ideas, and, expanded, on, them, feminist, scholar, angella, duvnjak, wrote, in, joining, the, dots, some, reflections, on, feminist, vegan, political, practice, and, choice, 2011, that, she, was, met, with, opposition, when, she, pointed, out, the, connection, between, feminist, and, vegan, ideals, even, though, the, connection, seemed, more, than, obvious, to, her, and, other, scholars, one, of, the, central, concepts, that, animates, feminist, veganism, is, the, idea, that, there, is, a, connection, between, the, oppression, of, women, and, the, oppression, of, animals, for, example, marjorie, spiegal, compared, the, consumption, or, servitude, of, animals, for, human, gain, to, slavery, this, connection, is, further, mirrored, by, feminist, vegan, writers, like, carrie, hamilton, who, wrote, that, violent, rapists, sometimes, exhibit, behavior, that, seems, to, be, patterned, on, the, mutilation, of, animals, suggesting, there, is, a, parallel, between, rape, and, animal, cruelty, feminist, veganism, also, relates, to, feminist, thought, through, the, common, critique, of, the, capitalist, means, of, production, in, an, interview, carol, j, adams, highlighted, meat, eating, as, the, ultimate, capitalist, product, because, it, takes, so, much, to, make, the, product, it, uses, up, so, many, resources, this, extensive, use, of, resources, for, meat, production, is, discouraged, in, favor, of, using, that, productive, capacity, for, other, food, products, that, have, a, less, detrimental, impact, on, the, environment, streams, within, a, number, of, religious, traditions, encourage, veganism, sometimes, on, ethical, or, environmental, grounds, scholars, have, especially, noted, the, growth, in, the, 21st, century, of, jewish, veganism, as, well, as, jain, veganism, some, religious, interpretations, such, as, christian, vegetarianism, hindu, vegetarianism, and, buddhist, vegetarianism, also, recommend, or, mandate, a, vegan, diet, donald, watson, argued, if, jesus, were, alive, today, he, d, be, an, itinerant, vegan, propagandist, instead, of, an, itinerant, preacher, of, those, days, spreading, the, message, of, compassion, which, as, i, see, it, is, the, only, useful, part, of, what, religion, has, to, offer, and, sad, as, it, seems, i, doubt, if, we, have, to, enroll, our, priest, as, a, member, of, the, vegan, society, in, the, u, s, black, veganism, is, a, social, and, political, philosophy, as, well, as, a, diet, it, connects, the, use, of, nonhuman, animals, with, other, social, justice, concerns, such, as, racism, and, with, the, lasting, effects, of, slavery, such, as, the, subsistence, diets, of, enslaved, people, enduring, as, familial, and, cultural, food, traditions,

to, oakland, activist, ashel, eldridge, the, movement, is, about, the, black, community, reclaiming, its, food, sovereignty, and, decolonizing, black, americans, diet, according, to, shah, the, area, where, most, vegans, of, color, feel, the, greatest, rift, with, mainstream, veganism, is, in, its, failure, to, recognize, the, intersectionality, with, other, social, justice, issues, such, as, food, access, in, 2021, vegan, climate, activist, greta, thunberg, called, for, more, vegan, food, production, and, consumption, worldwide, parties, like, tierschutzpartei, in, germany, and, pacma,

to, represent, their, identity, and, in, the, course, of, animal, rights, activism, such, as, a, vegan, flag, veganism, is, often, misrepresented, in, media, some, argue, that, veganism, has, been, dismissed, in, news, media, or, that, clickbait, culture, often, portrays, feminists, and, vegans, as, irrational, extremists, this, is, because, in, western, societies, meat, based, diets, are, the,
