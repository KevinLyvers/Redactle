in, medicine, and, the, social, sciences, a, young, adult, is, generally, a, person, in, the, years, following, adolescence, sometimes, with, some, overlap, definitions, and, opinions, on, what, qualifies, as, a, young, adult, vary, with, works, such, as, erik, erikson, s, stages, of, human, development, significantly, influencing, the, definition, of, the, term, generally, the, term, is, often, used, to, refer, to, adults, in, approximately, the, age, range, of, 18, to, 40, years, with, some, more, inclusive, definitions, extending, the, definition, into, the, early, to, mid, 40s, the, young, adult, stage, in, human, development, precedes, middle, adulthood, in, the, literary, business, the, term, young, adult, is, often, used, informally, or, in, a, marketing, sense, for, the, readers, of, young, adult, literature, books, targeted, at, children, down, to, ages, 12, or, 13, this, broad, extension, of, young, adult, to, minors, has, been, disputed, as, they, are, not, considered, adults, by, the, law, or, in, most, cultures, outside, of, religion, such, as, the, bar, or, bat, mitzvah, in, judaism, and, the, tradition, of, biological, adulthood, beginning, at, puberty, has, become, archaic, for, a, variety, of, reasons, timelines, on, young, adulthood, cannot, be, exactly, defined, producing, different, results, according, to, the, different, mix, of, overlapping, indices, legal, maturational, occupational, sexual, emotional, and, the, like, employed, or, on, whether, a, developmental, perspective, the, socialization, perspective, is, taken, sub, phases, in, this, timetable, of, psycho, social, growth, patterns, are, not, rigid, and, both, social, change, and, individual, variations, must, be, taken, into, account, not, to, mention, regional, and, cultural, differences, arguably, indeed, with, people, living, longer, and, also, reaching, puberty, earlier, age, norms, for, major, life, events, have, become, highly, elastic, by, the, twenty, first, century, due, to, generational, changes, the, pathway, for, young, adults, to, fulfill, their, adult, responsibilities, has, become, less, predictable, with, growing, changes, in, college, education, costs, living, arrangements, and, work, and, education, opportunities, young, adults, are, experiencing, various, life, transitions, in, many, stages, of, adulthood, rather, than, one, stage, itself, some, have, suggested, that, after, pre, adulthood, in, the, first, 20, years, or, so, the, second, era, early, adulthood, lasts, from, about, age, 17, to, 45, the, adult, era, of, greatest, energy, and, abundance, and, of, greatest, contradiction, and, stress, within, that, framework, the, early, adult, transition, 17, 22, is, a, developmental, bridge, between, pre, adulthood, and, early, adulthood, recognizing, that, the, transition, into, adulthood, is, not, a, clear, cut, dividing, line, one, might, alternatively, speak, of, a, provisional, adulthood, 18, 30, the, initiation, to, first, adulthood, as, following, that, alternatively, mit, has, generally, defined, young, adulthood, as, 18, to, 22, although, this, is, likely, to, align, with, the, typical, age, range, of, college, students, despite, all, such, fluidity, there, is, broad, agreement, that, it, is, essentially, the, twenties, and, thirties, which, constitute, early, adulthood, the, basis, for, what, levinson, calls, the, dream, a, vision, of, his, goals, in, life, which, provide, motivation, and, enthusiasm, for, the, future, young, prime, adulthood, can, be, considered, the, healthiest, time, of, life, and, young, adults, are, generally, in, good, health, subject, neither, to, disease, nor, the, problems, of, senescence, strength, and, physical, performance, reach, their, peak, from, 18, to, 39, years, of, age, flexibility, may, decrease, with, age, throughout, adulthood, the, female, reproductive, system, reaches, its, peak, fertility, during, the, early, 20s, of, women, who, want, to, become, pregnant, as, teens, transition, into, young, adulthood, engagement, in, risky, behavior, may, be, noticeable, which, may, result, in, health, risks, such, as, unintended, injury, unprotected, sex, violence, binge, drinking, motor, vehicle, incidents, suicide, and, poor, diet, and, nutrition, in, developed, countries, mortality, rates, for, the, 18, 40, age, group, are, typically, very, low, men, are, more, likely, to, die, at, this, age, than, women, particularly, in, the, 18, 25, group, reasons, include, car, accidents, and, suicide, mortality, statistics, among, men, and, women, level, off, during, the, late, twenties, and, thirties, due, in, part, to, good, health, and, less, risk, taking, behavior, regarding, disease, cancer, is, much, less, common, in, young, than, in, older, adults, exceptions, are, testicular, cancer, cervical, cancer, and, hodgkin, s, lymphoma, in, sub, saharan, africa, hiv, aids, has, hit, the, early, adult, population, particularly, hard, according, to, a, united, nations, report, aids, has, significantly, increased, mortality, of, between, ages, 20, to, 55, for, african, males, and, 20, to, 45, for, african, females, reducing, the, life, expectancy, in, south, africa, by, 18, years, and, in, botswana, by, 34, years, according, to, erik, erikson, in, the, wake, of, the, adolescent, emphasis, upon, identity, formation, the, young, adult, emerging, from, the, search, for, and, insistence, on, identity, is, eager, and, willing, to, fuse, their, identity, with, that, of, others, he, is, ready, for, intimacy, that, is, the, capacity, to, commit, to, concrete, affiliations, and, partnerships, to, do, so, means, the, ability, to, face, the, fear, of, ego, loss, in, situations, which, call, for, self, abandon, in, the, solidarity, of, close, affiliations, in, orgasms, and, sexual, unions, in, close, friendships, and, in, physical, combat, avoidance, of, such, experiences, because, of, a, fear, of, ego, loss, may, lead, to, a, deep, sense, of, isolation, and, consequent, self, absorption, where, isolation, is, avoided, the, young, adult, may, find, instead, that, satisfactory, sex, relations, in, some, way, take, the, edge, off, the, hostilities, and, potential, rages, caused, by, the, oppositeness, of, male, and, female, of, fact, and, fancy, of, love, and, hate, and, may, grow, into, the, ability, to, exchange, intimacy, love, and, compassion, in, modern, societies, young, adults, in, their, late, teens, and, early, 20s, encounter, a, number, of, issues, as, they, finish, school, and, begin, to, hold, full, time, jobs, and, take, on, other, responsibilities, of, adulthood, and, the, young, adult, is, usually, preoccupied, with, self, growth, in, the, context, of, society, and, relationships, with, others, the, danger, is, that, in, the, second, era, early, adulthood, we, must, make, crucially, important, choices, regarding, marriage, family, work, and, lifestyle, before, we, have, the, maturity, or, life, experience, to, choose, wisely, while, young, adulthood, is, filled, with, avid, quests, for, intimate, relationships, and, other, major, commitments, involving, career, and, life, goals, there, is, also, a, parallel, pursuit, for, the, formulation, of, a, set, of, moral, values, erikson, has, argued, that, it, is, only, now, that, what, he, calls, the, ideological, mind, of, adolescence, gives, way, to, that, ethical, sense, which, is, the, mark, of, the, adult, reaching, adulthood, in, modern, society, is, not, always, a, linear, or, clean, transition, as, generations, continue, to, adapt, new, markers, of, adulthood, are, created, that, add, different, social, expectations, of, what, it, means, to, be, an, adult, daniel, levinson, argued, that, developmental, sequences, continue, to, occur, as, we, transition, into, adulthood, levinson, s, theory, centers, around, erik, erikson, s, conception, of, life, courses, this, theory, of, erikson, includes, patterns, and, relationships, of, events, for, the, person, s, life, that, distinguishes, them, the, study, of, the, life, courses, covers, all, aspects, of, the, life, relationships, internal, and, external, feelings, bodily, changes, and, the, good, and, bad, times, that, are, experienced, preadulthood, early, adulthood, middle, adulthood, and, late, adulthood, are, the, four, eras, that, constitute, the, life, course, preadulthood, begins, with, conception, and, continues, to, roughly, the, age, of, 22, during, these, years, the, person, grows, from, being, extremely, dependent, and, undifferentiated, to, being, a, more, independent, responsible, adult, this, is, the, era, that, we, see, the, most, biopsychosocial, growth, the, early, adulthood, transition, is, part, of, this, first, stage, while, also, being, a, part, of, the, second, stage, this, is, from, the, age, of, 17, to, 22, here, is, when, the, preadulthood, era, begins, to, draw, to, a, close, and, the, transition, to, early, adulthood, begins, it, is, here, that, the, individual, begins, to, modify, their, relationship, from, the, preadult, world, so, that, they, fit, better, to, the, adult, world, they, are, creating, the, second, era, early, adulthood, begins, at, age, 17, and, goes, till, 45, it, begins, during, the, early, adulthood, transition, and, has, the, greatest, amount, of, energy, contradiction, and, stress, this, is, typically, the, time, for, forming, and, pursuing, aspirations, finding, a, place, in, society, forming, families, and, as, the, era, ends, establishing, a, solid, position, in, the, adult, world, the, third, period, middle, adulthood, begins, at, age, 45, and, goes, till, 65, here, we, begin, to, see, a, decline, in, our, biological, capacities, the, decline, is, not, enough, to, completely, deplete, us, of, the, energy, we, had, during, early, adulthood, and, it, allows, for, us, to, continue, to, have, a, socially, valuable, life, the, final, era, is, late, adulthood, this, begins, with, age, 65, and, goes, till, death, in, this, era, the, individual, has, to, find, a, new, balance, between, involvement, with, society, and, the, self, the, individual, is, experiencing, more, fully, the, process, of, dying, and, here, should, be, given, the, ability, to, freely, choose, the, mode, of, life, after, the, relative, upheaval, of, the, early, 30s, the, middle, to, late, 30s, are, often, characterized, by, settling, down, the, establishment, phase, involving, what, we, would, call, major, life, investments, work, family, friends, community, activities, and, values, after, making, major, investments, in, life, individuals, make, deeper, commitments, and, investing, more, of, themselves, to, these, commitments, what, has, been, termed, the, culminating, life, structure, for, early, adulthood, 33, 40, is, the, vehicle, for, completing, this, era, and, realizing, our, youthful, aspirations, people, in, their, thirties, may, increase, the, financial, and, emotional, investments, they, make, in, their, lives, and, may, have, been, employed, long, enough, to, gain, promotions, and, raises, they, often, become, more, focused, on, advancing, their, careers, and, gaining, stability, in, their, personal, lives, with, marriage, and, child, rearing, starting, a, family, coming, to, the, fore, as, priorities, gail, sheehy, however, signposts, the, same, twenties, thirties, division, differently, arguing, that, the, twenties, have, stretched, out, into, a, long, provisional, adulthood, and, that, in, fact, the, transition, to, the, turbulent, thirties, marks, the, initiation, to, first, adulthood, young, adulthood, then, draws, to, its, close, with, the, midlife, transition, from, roughly, age, 40, to, 45, producing, a, brand, new, passage, in, the, forties, when, first, adulthood, ends, and, second, adulthood, begins, in, the, midlife, transition, early, adulthood, often, ends, and, individuals, make, changes, in, their, lives, such, as, in, their, career, the, end, of, early, adulthood, can, be, defined, as, when, a, person, stops, seeking, adult, status, or, wanting, to, feel, like, an, adult, when, people, reach, the, midlife, transition, they, shift, from, talking, about, how, old, they, are, to, bolster, their, reputation, and, emphasize, how, young, they, are, in, the, midlife, transition, individuals, focus, more, on, the, present, than, the, future, and, the, past, in, this, transitional, period, from, early, adulthood, to, middle, adulthood, changes, individuals, make, tend, to, focus, less, on, the, self, and, more, on, relationships, in, addition, individuals, experience, physical, changes, outside, of, the, changes, that, occur, to, the, individual, s, character, and, this, may, necessitate, changes, to, their, perceived, body, image, levinson, thought, midlife, to, be, a, time, of, development, of, crisis, however, research, today, in, the, united, states, shows, that, individuals, do, not, experience, a, midlife, crisis, instead, individuals, report, midlife, to, be, a, freeing, and, satisfying, period, of, life, in, the, midlife, transition, the, issue, is, not, whether, the, individual, has, achieved, or, failed, in, accomplishing, the, goals, they, formed, in, the, previous, era, rather, the, issue, at, hand, is, what, the, individual, should, be, doing, with, the, experience, of, disparity, between, their, goals, and, outcomes
