bread, is, a, staple, food, prepared, from, a, dough, of, flour, usually, wheat, and, water, usually, by, baking, throughout, recorded, history, and, around, the, world, it, has, been, an, important, part, of, many, cultures, diet, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, human, made, foods, having, been, of, significance, since, the, dawn, of, agriculture, and, plays, an, essential, role, in, both, religious, rituals, and, secular, culture, bread, may, be, leavened, by, naturally, occurring, microbes, e, g, sourdough, chemicals, e, g, baking, soda, industrially, produced, yeast, or, high, pressure, aeration, which, creates, the, gas, bubbles, that, fluff, up, bread, in, many, countries, commercial, bread, often, contains, additives, to, improve, flavor, texture, color, shelf, life, nutrition, and, ease, of, production, the, old, english, word, for, bread, was, hlaf, hlaifs, in, gothic, modern, english, loaf, which, appears, to, be, the, oldest, teutonic, name, old, high, german, hleib, and, modern, german, laib, derive, from, this, proto, germanic, word, which, was, borrowed, into, some, slavic, czech, chl, b, polish, bochen, chleba, russian, khleb, and, finnic, finnish, leip, estonian, leib, languages, as, well, the, middle, and, modern, english, word, bread, appears, in, other, germanic, languages, such, as, west, frisian, brea, dutch, brood, german, brot, swedish, br, d, and, norwegian, and, danish, br, d, it, may, be, related, to, brew, or, perhaps, to, break, originally, meaning, broken, piece, morsel, bread, is, one, of, the, oldest, prepared, foods, evidence, from, 30, 000, years, ago, in, europe, and, australia, revealed, starch, residue, on, rocks, used, for, pounding, plants, it, is, possible, that, during, this, time, starch, extract, from, the, roots, of, plants, such, as, cattails, and, ferns, was, spread, on, a, flat, rock, placed, over, a, fire, and, cooked, into, a, primitive, form, of, flatbread, the, oldest, evidence, of, bread, making, has, been, found, in, a, 14, 500, year, old, natufian, site, in, jordan, s, northeastern, desert, around, 10, 000, bc, with, the, dawn, of, the, neolithic, age, and, the, spread, of, agriculture, grains, became, the, mainstay, of, making, bread, yeast, spores, are, ubiquitous, including, on, the, surface, of, cereal, grains, so, any, dough, left, to, rest, leavens, naturally, an, early, leavened, bread, was, baked, as, early, as, 6000, bc, in, southern, mesopotamia, cradle, of, the, sumerian, civilization, who, may, have, passed, on, the, knowledge, to, the, egyptians, around, 3000, bc, the, egyptians, refined, the, process, and, started, adding, yeast, to, the, flour, the, sumerians, were, already, using, ash, to, supplement, the, dough, as, it, was, baked, there, were, multiple, sources, of, leavening, available, for, early, bread, airborne, yeasts, could, be, harnessed, by, leaving, uncooked, dough, exposed, to, air, for, some, time, before, cooking, pliny, the, elder, reported, that, the, gauls, and, iberians, used, the, foam, skimmed, from, beer, called, barm, to, produce, a, lighter, kind, of, bread, than, other, peoples, such, as, barm, cake, parts, of, the, ancient, world, that, drank, wine, instead, of, beer, used, a, paste, composed, of, grape, juice, and, flour, that, was, allowed, to, begin, fermenting, or, wheat, bran, steeped, in, wine, as, a, source, for, yeast, the, most, common, source, of, leavening, was, to, retain, a, piece, of, dough, from, the, previous, day, to, use, as, a, form, of, sourdough, starter, as, pliny, also, reported, the, ancient, egyptians, greeks, and, romans, all, considered, the, degree, of, refinement, in, the, bakery, arts, as, a, sign, of, civilization, the, chorleywood, bread, process, was, developed, in, 1961, it, uses, the, intense, mechanical, working, of, dough, to, dramatically, reduce, the, fermentation, period, and, the, time, taken, to, produce, a, loaf, the, process, whose, high, energy, mixing, allows, for, the, use, of, grain, with, a, lower, protein, content, is, now, widely, used, around, the, world, in, large, factories, as, a, result, bread, can, be, produced, very, quickly, and, at, low, costs, to, the, manufacturer, and, the, consumer, however, there, has, been, some, criticism, of, the, effect, on, nutritional, value, bread, is, the, staple, food, of, the, middle, east, central, asia, north, africa, europe, and, in, european, derived, cultures, such, as, those, in, the, americas, australia, and, southern, africa, this, is, in, contrast, to, parts, of, south, and, east, asia, where, rice, or, noodles, are, the, staple, bread, is, usually, made, from, a, wheat, flour, dough, that, is, cultured, with, yeast, allowed, to, rise, and, baked, in, an, oven, carbon, dioxide, and, ethanol, vapors, produced, during, yeast, fermentation, result, in, bread, s, air, pockets, owing, to, its, high, levels, of, gluten, which, give, the, dough, sponginess, and, elasticity, common, or, bread, wheat, is, the, most, common, grain, used, for, the, preparation, of, bread, which, makes, the, largest, single, contribution, to, the, world, s, food, supply, of, any, food, bread, is, also, made, from, the, flour, of, other, wheat, species, including, spelt, emmer, einkorn, and, kamut, non, wheat, cereals, including, rye, barley, maize, corn, oats, sorghum, millet, and, rice, have, been, used, to, make, bread, but, with, the, exception, of, rye, usually, in, combination, with, wheat, flour, as, they, have, less, gluten, gluten, free, breads, are, made, using, flours, from, a, variety, of, ingredients, such, as, almonds, rice, sorghum, corn, legumes, such, as, beans, and, tubers, such, as, cassava, since, these, foods, lack, gluten, dough, made, from, them, may, not, hold, its, shape, as, the, loaves, rise, and, their, crumb, may, be, dense, with, little, aeration, additives, such, as, xanthan, gum, guar, gum, hydroxypropyl, methylcellulose, hpmc, corn, starch, or, eggs, are, used, to, compensate, for, the, lack, of, gluten, in, wheat, phenolic, compounds, are, mainly, found, in, hulls, in, the, form, of, insoluble, bound, ferulic, acid, where, it, is, relevant, to, wheat, resistance, to, fungal, diseases, rye, bread, contains, phenolic, acids, and, ferulic, acid, dehydrodimers, three, natural, phenolic, glucosides, secoisolariciresinol, diglucoside, p, coumaric, acid, glucoside, and, ferulic, acid, glucoside, can, be, found, in, commercial, breads, containing, flaxseed, glutenin, and, gliadin, are, functional, proteins, found, in, wheat, bread, that, contribute, to, the, structure, of, bread, glutenin, forms, interconnected, gluten, networks, within, bread, through, interchain, disulfide, bonds, gliadin, binds, weakly, to, the, gluten, network, established, by, glutenin, via, intrachain, disulfide, bonds, structurally, bread, can, be, defined, as, an, elastic, plastic, foam, same, as, styrofoam, the, glutenin, protein, contributes, to, its, elastic, nature, as, it, is, able, to, regain, its, initial, shape, after, deformation, the, gliadin, protein, contributes, to, its, plastic, nature, because, it, demonstrates, non, reversible, structural, change, after, a, certain, amount, of, applied, force, because, air, pockets, within, this, gluten, network, result, from, carbon, dioxide, production, during, leavening, bread, can, be, defined, as, a, foam, or, a, gas, in, solid, solution, acrylamide, like, in, other, starchy, foods, that, have, been, heated, higher, than, 120, c, 248, f, has, been, found, in, recent, years, to, occur, in, bread, acrylamide, is, neurotoxic, has, adverse, effects, on, male, reproduction, and, developmental, toxicity, and, is, carcinogenic, a, study, has, found, that, more, than, 99, percent, of, the, acrylamide, in, bread, is, found, in, the, crust, a, study, by, the, university, of, hohenheim, found, that, industrially, produced, bread, typically, has, a, high, proportion, of, fodmap, carbohydrates, due, to, a, short, rising, time, often, only, one, hour, the, high, proportion, of, fodmap, carbohydrates, in, such, bread, then, causes, flatulence, this, is, particularly, problematic, in, intestinal, diseases, such, as, irritable, bowel, syndrome, while, in, traditional, bread, making, the, dough, rises, for, several, hours, industrial, breads, rise, for, a, much, shorter, time, usually, only, one, hour, however, a, sufficiently, long, rising, time, is, important, to, break, down, the, indigestible, fodmap, carbohydrates, some, flours, for, example, spelt, emmer, and, einkorn, contain, fewer, fodmaps, but, the, difference, between, grain, types, is, relatively, small, between, 1, and, 2, percent, by, weight, instead, 90, of, the, fodmaps, that, cause, discomfort, can, be, broken, down, during, a, rising, time, of, four, hours, in, the, study, whole, grain, yeast, doughs, were, examined, after, different, rising, times, the, highest, level, of, fodmaps, was, present, after, one, hour, in, each, case, and, decreased, thereafter, the, study, thus, shows, that, it, is, essentially, the, baking, technique, and, not, the, type, of, grain, that, determines, whether, a, bread, is, well, tolerated, or, not, a, better, tolerance, of, bread, made, from, original, cereals, can, therefore, not, be, explained, by, the, original, cereal, itself, but, rather, by, the, fact, that, traditional, artisanal, baking, techniques, are, generally, used, when, baking, original, cereals, which, include, a, long, dough, process, the, study, also, showed, that, a, long, rising, time, also, breaks, down, undesirable, phytates, more, effectively, flavors, develop, better, and, the, finished, bread, contains, more, biologically, accessible, trace, elements, bread, can, be, served, at, many, temperatures, once, baked, it, can, subsequently, be, toasted, it, is, most, commonly, eaten, with, the, hands, either, by, itself, or, as, a, carrier, for, other, foods, bread, can, be, spread, with, butter, dipped, into, liquids, such, as, gravy, olive, oil, or, soup, it, can, be, topped, with, various, sweet, and, savory, spreads, or, used, to, make, sandwiches, containing, meats, cheeses, vegetables, and, condiments, bread, is, used, as, an, ingredient, in, other, culinary, preparations, such, as, the, use, of, breadcrumbs, to, provide, crunchy, crusts, or, thicken, sauces, toasted, cubes, of, bread, called, croutons, are, used, as, a, salad, topping, seasoned, bread, is, used, as, stuffing, inside, roasted, turkey, sweet, or, savoury, bread, puddings, are, made, with, bread, and, various, liquids, egg, and, milk, soaked, bread, is, fried, as, french, toast, and, bread, is, used, as, a, binding, agent, in, sausages, meatballs, and, other, ground, meat, products, bread, is, a, good, source, of, carbohydrates, and, micronutrients, such, as, magnesium, iron, selenium, and, b, vitamins, whole, grain, bread, is, a, good, source, of, dietary, fiber, and, all, breads, are, a, common, source, of, protein, in, the, diet, though, not, a, rich, one, bread, crust, is, formed, from, surface, dough, during, the, cooking, process, it, is, hardened, and, browned, through, the, maillard, reaction, using, the, sugars, and, amino, acids, due, to, the, intense, heat, at, the, bread, surface, the, crust, of, most, breads, is, harder, and, more, complexly, and, intensely, flavored, than, the, rest, old, wives, tales, suggest, that, eating, the, bread, crust, makes, a, person, s, hair, curlier, additionally, the, crust, is, rumored, to, be, healthier, than, the, remainder, of, the, bread, some, studies, have, shown, that, this, is, true, as, the, crust, has, more, dietary, fiber, and, antioxidants, such, as, pronyl, lysine, doughs, are, usually, baked, but, in, some, cuisines, breads, are, steamed, e, g, mantou, fried, e, g, puri, or, baked, on, an, unoiled, frying, pan, e, g, tortillas, it, may, be, leavened, or, unleavened, e, g, matzo, salt, fat, and, leavening, agents, such, as, yeast, and, baking, soda, are, common, ingredients, though, bread, may, contain, other, ingredients, such, as, milk, egg, sugar, spice, fruit, such, as, raisins, vegetables, such, as, onion, nuts, such, as, walnut, or, seeds, such, as, poppy, methods, of, processing, dough, into, bread, include, the, straight, dough, process, the, sourdough, process, the, chorleywood, bread, process, and, the, sponge, and, dough, process, professional, bread, recipes, are, stated, using, the, baker, s, percentage, notation, the, amount, of, flour, is, denoted, to, be, 100, and, the, other, ingredients, are, expressed, as, a, percentage, of, that, amount, by, weight, measurement, by, weight, is, more, accurate, and, consistent, than, measurement, by, volume, particularly, for, dry, ingredients, the, proportion, of, water, to, flour, is, the, most, important, measurement, in, a, bread, recipe, as, it, affects, texture, and, crumb, the, most, hard, wheat, flours, absorb, about, 62, water, while, softer, wheat, flours, absorb, about, 56, common, table, breads, made, from, these, doughs, result, in, a, finely, textured, light, bread, most, artisan, bread, formulas, contain, anywhere, from, 60, to, 75, water, in, yeast, breads, the, higher, water, percentages, result, in, more, co, 2, bubbles, and, a, coarser, bread, crumb, dough, recipes, commonly, call, for, 500, grams, about, 1, 1, pounds, of, flour, which, yields, a, single, loaf, of, bread, or, two, baguettes, calcium, propionate, is, commonly, added, by, commercial, bakeries, to, retard, the, growth, of, molds, flour, is, grain, ground, into, a, powder, flour, provides, the, primary, structure, starch, and, protein, to, the, final, baked, bread, the, protein, content, of, the, flour, is, the, best, indicator, of, the, quality, of, the, bread, dough, and, the, finished, bread, while, bread, can, be, made, from, all, purpose, wheat, flour, a, specialty, bread, flour, containing, more, protein, 12, 14, is, recommended, for, high, quality, bread, if, one, uses, a, flour, with, a, lower, protein, content, 9, 11, to, produce, bread, a, shorter, mixing, time, is, required, to, develop, gluten, strength, properly, an, extended, mixing, time, leads, to, oxidization, of, the, dough, which, gives, the, finished, product, a, whiter, crumb, instead, of, the, cream, color, preferred, by, most, artisan, bakers, wheat, flour, in, addition, to, its, starch, contains, three, water, soluble, protein, groups, albumin, globulin, and, proteoses, and, two, water, insoluble, protein, groups, glutenin, and, gliadin, when, flour, is, mixed, with, water, the, water, soluble, proteins, dissolve, leaving, the, glutenin, and, gliadin, to, form, the, structure, of, the, resulting, bread, when, relatively, dry, dough, is, worked, by, kneading, or, wet, dough, is, allowed, to, rise, for, a, long, time, see, no, knead, bread, the, glutenin, forms, strands, of, long, thin, chainlike, molecules, while, the, shorter, gliadin, forms, bridges, between, the, strands, of, glutenin, the, resulting, networks, of, strands, produced, by, these, two, proteins, are, known, as, gluten, gluten, development, improves, if, the, dough, is, allowed, to, autolyse, water, or, some, other, liquid, is, used, to, form, the, flour, into, a, paste, or, dough, the, weight, or, ratio, of, liquid, required, varies, between, recipes, but, a, ratio, of, three, parts, liquid, to, five, parts, flour, is, common, for, yeast, breads, recipes, that, use, steam, as, the, primary, leavening, method, may, have, a, liquid, content, in, excess, of, one, part, liquid, to, one, part, flour, instead, of, water, recipes, may, use, liquids, such, as, milk, or, other, dairy, products, including, buttermilk, or, yogurt, fruit, juice, or, eggs, these, contribute, additional, sweeteners, fats, or, leavening, components, as, well, as, water, fats, such, as, butter, vegetable, oils, lard, or, that, contained, in, eggs, affect, the, development, of, gluten, in, breads, by, coating, and, lubricating, the, individual, strands, of, protein, they, also, help, to, hold, the, structure, together, if, too, much, fat, is, included, in, a, bread, dough, the, lubrication, effect, causes, the, protein, structures, to, divide, a, fat, content, of, approximately, 3, by, weight, is, the, concentration, that, produces, the, greatest, leavening, action, in, addition, to, their, effects, on, leavening, fats, also, serve, to, tenderize, breads, and, preserve, freshness, bread, improvers, and, dough, conditioners, are, often, used, in, producing, commercial, breads, to, reduce, the, time, needed, for, rising, and, to, improve, texture, and, volume, and, to, give, antistaling, effects, the, substances, used, may, be, oxidising, agents, to, strengthen, the, dough, or, reducing, agents, to, develop, gluten, and, reduce, mixing, time, emulsifiers, to, strengthen, the, dough, or, to, provide, other, properties, such, as, making, slicing, easier, or, enzymes, to, increase, gas, production, salt, sodium, chloride, is, very, often, added, to, enhance, flavor, and, restrict, yeast, activity, it, also, affects, the, crumb, and, the, overall, texture, by, stabilizing, and, strengthening, the, gluten, some, artisan, bakers, forego, early, addition, of, salt, to, the, dough, whether, wholemeal, or, refined, and, wait, until, after, a, 20, minute, rest, to, allow, the, dough, to, autolyse, mixtures, of, salts, are, sometimes, employed, such, as, employing, potassium, chloride, to, reduce, the, sodium, level, and, monosodium, glutamate, to, give, flavor, umami, leavening, is, the, process, of, adding, gas, to, a, dough, before, or, during, baking, to, produce, a, lighter, more, easily, chewed, bread, most, bread, eaten, in, the, west, is, leavened, a, simple, technique, for, leavening, bread, is, the, use, of, gas, producing, chemicals, there, are, two, common, methods, the, first, is, to, use, baking, powder, or, a, self, raising, flour, that, includes, baking, powder, the, second, is, to, include, an, acidic, ingredient, such, as, buttermilk, and, add, baking, soda, the, reaction, of, the, acid, with, the, soda, produces, gas, chemically, leavened, breads, are, called, quick, breads, and, soda, breads, this, method, is, commonly, used, to, make, muffins, pancakes, american, style, biscuits, and, quick, breads, such, as, banana, bread, many, breads, are, leavened, by, yeast, the, yeast, most, commonly, used, for, leavening, bread, is, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, the, same, species, used, for, brewing, alcoholic, beverages, this, yeast, ferments, some, of, the, sugars, producing, carbon, dioxide, commercial, bakers, often, leaven, their, dough, with, commercially, produced, baker, s, yeast, baker, s, yeast, has, the, advantage, of, producing, uniform, quick, and, reliable, results, because, it, is, obtained, from, a, pure, culture, many, artisan, bakers, produce, their, own, yeast, with, a, growth, culture, if, kept, in, the, right, conditions, it, provides, leavening, for, many, years, the, baker, s, yeast, and, sourdough, methods, follow, the, same, pattern, water, is, mixed, with, flour, salt, and, the, leavening, agent, other, additions, spices, herbs, fats, seeds, fruit, etc, are, not, needed, to, bake, bread, but, are, often, used, the, mixed, dough, is, then, allowed, to, rise, one, or, more, times, a, longer, rising, time, results, in, more, flavor, so, bakers, often, punch, down, the, dough, and, let, it, rise, again, loaves, are, formed, and, after, an, optional, final, rising, time, the, bread, is, baked, in, an, oven, many, breads, are, made, from, a, straight, dough, which, means, that, all, of, the, ingredients, are, combined, in, one, step, and, the, dough, is, baked, after, the, rising, time, others, are, made, from, a, pre, ferment, in, which, the, leavening, agent, is, combined, with, some, of, the, flour, and, water, a, day, or, so, ahead, of, baking, and, allowed, to, ferment, overnight, on, the, day, of, baking, the, rest, of, the, ingredients, are, added, and, the, process, continues, as, with, straight, dough, this, produces, a, more, flavorful, bread, with, better, texture, many, bakers, see, the, starter, method, as, a, compromise, between, the, reliable, results, of, baker, s, yeast, and, the, flavor, and, complexity, of, a, longer, fermentation, it, also, allows, the, baker, to, use, only, a, minimal, amount, of, baker, s, yeast, which, was, scarce, and, expensive, when, it, first, became, available, most, yeasted, pre, ferments, fall, into, one, of, three, categories, poolish, or, pouliche, a, loose, textured, mixture, composed, of, roughly, equal, amounts, of, flour, and, water, by, weight, biga, a, stiff, mixture, with, a, higher, proportion, of, flour, and, p, te, ferment, e, which, is, a, portion, of, dough, reserved, from, a, previous, batch, sourdough, is, a, type, of, bread, produced, by, a, long, fermentation, of, dough, using, naturally, occurring, yeasts, and, lactobacilli, it, usually, has, a, mildly, sour, taste, because, of, the, lactic, acid, produced, during, anaerobic, fermentation, by, the, lactobacilli, longer, fermented, sourdoughs, can, also, contain, acetic, acid, the, main, non, water, component, of, vinegar, sourdough, breads, are, made, with, a, sourdough, starter, the, starter, cultivates, yeast, and, lactobacilli, in, a, mixture, of, flour, and, water, making, use, of, the, microorganisms, already, present, on, flour, it, does, not, need, any, added, yeast, a, starter, may, be, maintained, indefinitely, by, regular, additions, of, flour, and, water, some, bakers, have, starters, many, generations, old, which, are, said, to, have, a, special, taste, or, texture, at, one, time, all, yeast, leavened, breads, were, sourdoughs, recently, there, has, been, a, revival, of, sourdough, bread, in, artisan, bakeries, traditionally, peasant, families, throughout, europe, baked, on, a, fixed, schedule, perhaps, once, a, week, the, starter, was, saved, from, the, previous, week, s, dough, the, starter, was, mixed, with, the, new, ingredients, the, dough, was, left, to, rise, and, then, a, piece, of, it, was, saved, to, be, the, starter, for, next, week, s, bread, the, rapid, expansion, of, steam, produced, during, baking, leavens, the, bread, which, is, as, simple, as, it, is, unpredictable, steam, leavening, is, unpredictable, since, the, steam, is, not, produced, until, the, bread, is, baked, steam, leavening, happens, regardless, of, the, raising, agents, baking, soda, yeast, baking, powder, sour, dough, beaten, egg, white, included, in, the, mix, the, leavening, agent, either, contains, air, bubbles, or, generates, carbon, dioxide, the, heat, vaporises, the, water, from, the, inner, surface, of, the, bubbles, within, the, dough, the, steam, expands, and, makes, the, bread, rise, this, is, the, main, factor, in, the, rising, of, bread, once, it, has, been, put, in, the, oven, co, 2, generation, on, its, own, is, too, small, to, account, for, the, rise, heat, kills, bacteria, or, yeast, at, an, early, stage, so, the, co, 2, generation, is, stopped, salt, rising, bread, does, not, use, yeast, instead, it, is, leavened, by, clostridium, perfringens, one, of, the, most, common, sources, of, food, borne, illness, aerated, bread, is, leavened, by, carbon, dioxide, being, forced, into, dough, under, pressure, from, the, mid, 19th, to, mid, 20th, centuries, bread, made, this, way, was, somewhat, popular, in, the, united, kingdom, made, by, the, aerated, bread, company, and, sold, in, its, high, street, tearooms, the, company, was, founded, in, 1862, and, ceased, independent, operations, in, 1955, the, pressure, vacuum, mixer, was, later, developed, by, the, flour, milling, and, baking, research, association, for, the, chorleywood, bread, process, it, manipulates, the, gas, bubble, size, and, optionally, the, composition, of, gases, in, the, dough, via, the, gas, applied, to, the, headspace, bread, has, a, significance, beyond, mere, nutrition, in, many, cultures, because, of, its, history, and, contemporary, importance, bread, is, also, significant, in, christianity, as, one, of, the, elements, alongside, wine, of, the, eucharist, and, in, other, religions, including, paganism, in, many, cultures, bread, is, a, metaphor, for, basic, necessities, and, living, conditions, in, general, for, example, a, bread, winner, is, a, household, s, main, economic, contributor, and, has, little, to, do, with, actual, bread, provision, this, is, also, seen, in, the, phrase, putting, bread, on, the, table, the, roman, poet, juvenal, satirized, superficial, politicians, and, the, public, as, caring, only, for, panem, et, circenses, bread, and, circuses, in, russia, in, 1917, the, bolsheviks, promised, peace, land, and, bread, the, term, breadbasket, denotes, an, agriculturally, productive, region, in, parts, of, northern, central, southern, and, eastern, europe, bread, and, salt, is, offered, as, a, welcome, to, guests, in, india, life, s, basic, necessities, are, often, referred, to, as, roti, kapra, aur, makan, bread, cloth, and, house, words, for, bread, including, dough, and, bread, itself, are, used, in, english, speaking, countries, as, synonyms, for, money, a, remarkable, or, revolutionary, innovation, may, be, called, the, best, thing, since, sliced, bread, the, expression, to, break, bread, with,
