canning, is, a, method, of, food, preservation, in, which, food, is, processed, and, sealed, in, an, airtight, container, jars, like, mason, jars, and, steel, and, tin, cans, canning, provides, a, shelf, life, that, typically, ranges, from, one, to, five, years, although, under, specific, circumstances, it, can, be, much, longer, a, freeze, dried, canned, product, such, as, canned, dried, lentils, could, last, as, long, as, 30, years, in, an, edible, state, in, 1974, samples, of, canned, food, from, the, wreck, of, the, bertrand, a, steamboat, that, sank, in, the, missouri, river, in, 1865, were, tested, by, the, national, food, processors, association, although, appearance, smell, and, vitamin, content, had, deteriorated, there, was, no, trace, of, microbial, growth, and, the, 109, year, old, food, was, determined, to, be, still, safe, to, eat, shortly, before, the, napoleonic, wars, the, french, government, offered, a, hefty, cash, award, of, 12, 000, francs, to, any, inventor, who, could, devise, a, cheap, and, effective, method, of, preserving, large, amounts, of, food, to, create, well, preserved, military, rations, for, the, grande, arm, e, the, larger, armies, of, the, period, required, increased, and, regular, supplies, of, quality, food, limited, food, availability, was, among, the, factors, limiting, military, campaigns, to, the, summer, and, autumn, months, in, 1809, nicolas, appert, a, french, confectioner, and, brewer, observed, that, food, cooked, inside, a, jar, did, not, spoil, unless, the, seals, leaked, and, developed, a, method, of, sealing, food, in, glass, jars, appert, was, awarded, the, prize, in, 1810, by, count, montelivert, a, french, minister, of, the, interior, the, reason, for, lack, of, spoilage, was, unknown, at, the, time, since, it, would, be, another, 50, years, before, louis, pasteur, demonstrated, the, role, of, microbes, in, food, spoilage, and, developed, pasteurization, the, grande, arm, e, began, experimenting, with, issuing, canned, foods, to, its, soldiers, but, the, slow, process, of, canning, and, the, even, slower, development, and, transport, stages, prevented, the, army, from, shipping, large, amounts, across, the, french, empire, and, the, wars, ended, before, the, process, was, perfected, following, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, the, canning, process, was, gradually, employed, in, other, european, countries, and, the, united, states, based, on, appert, s, methods, of, food, preservation, the, tin, can, process, was, allegedly, developed, by, frenchman, philippe, de, girard, who, came, to, london, and, used, british, merchant, peter, durand, as, an, agent, to, patent, his, own, idea, in, 1810, durand, did, not, pursue, food, canning, himself, selling, his, patent, in, 1811, to, bryan, donkin, and, john, hall, who, were, in, business, as, donkin, hall, and, gamble, of, bermondsey, bryan, donkin, developed, the, process, of, packaging, food, in, sealed, airtight, cans, made, of, tinned, wrought, iron, initially, the, canning, process, was, slow, and, labour, intensive, as, each, large, can, had, to, be, hand, made, and, took, up, to, six, hours, to, cook, making, canned, food, too, expensive, for, ordinary, people, the, main, market, for, the, food, at, this, stage, was, the, british, army, and, royal, navy, by, 1817, donkin, recorded, that, he, had, sold, 3000, worth, of, canned, meat, in, six, months, in, 1824, sir, william, edward, parry, took, canned, beef, and, pea, soup, with, him, on, his, voyage, to, the, arctic, in, hms, fury, during, his, search, for, a, northwestern, passage, to, india, in, 1829, admiral, sir, james, ross, also, took, canned, food, to, the, arctic, as, did, sir, john, franklin, in, 1845, some, of, his, stores, were, found, by, the, search, expedition, led, by, captain, later, admiral, sir, leopold, mcclintock, in, 1857, one, of, these, cans, was, opened, in, 1939, and, was, edible, and, nutritious, though, it, was, not, analysed, for, contamination, by, the, lead, solder, used, in, its, manufacture, during, the, mid, 19th, century, canned, food, became, a, status, symbol, among, middle, class, households, in, europe, being, something, of, a, frivolous, novelty, early, methods, of, manufacture, employed, poisonous, lead, solder, for, sealing, the, cans, studies, in, the, 1980s, attributed, the, lead, from, the, cans, as, a, factor, in, the, disastrous, outcome, of, the, 1845, franklin, expedition, to, chart, and, navigate, the, northwest, passage, however, studies, in, 2013, and, 2016, suggested, that, lead, poisoning, was, likely, not, a, factor, and, that, the, crew, s, ill, health, may, in, fact, have, been, due, to, malnutrition, specifically, zinc, deficiency, possibly, due, to, a, lack, of, meat, in, their, diet, increasing, mechanization, of, the, canning, process, coupled, with, a, huge, increase, in, urban, populations, across, europe, resulted, in, a, rising, demand, for, canned, food, a, number, of, inventions, and, improvements, followed, and, by, the, 1860s, smaller, machine, made, steel, cans, were, possible, and, the, time, to, cook, food, in, sealed, cans, had, been, reduced, from, around, six, hours, to, thirty, minutes, canned, food, also, began, to, spread, beyond, europe, robert, ayars, established, the, first, american, canning, factory, in, new, york, city, in, 1812, using, improved, tin, plated, wrought, iron, cans, for, preserving, oysters, meats, fruits, and, vegetables, demand, for, canned, food, greatly, increased, during, wars, large, scale, wars, in, the, nineteenth, century, such, as, the, crimean, war, american, civil, war, and, franco, prussian, war, introduced, increasing, numbers, of, working, class, men, to, canned, food, and, allowed, canning, companies, to, expand, their, businesses, to, meet, military, demands, for, non, perishable, food, enabling, companies, to, manufacture, in, bulk, and, sell, to, wider, civilian, markets, after, wars, ended, urban, populations, in, victorian, britain, demanded, ever, increasing, quantities, of, cheap, varied, quality, food, that, they, could, keep, at, home, without, having, to, go, shopping, daily, in, response, companies, such, as, underwood, nestl, heinz, and, others, provided, quality, canned, food, for, sale, to, working, class, city, dwellers, the, late, 19th, century, saw, the, range, of, canned, food, available, to, urban, populations, greatly, increase, as, canners, competed, with, each, other, using, novel, foodstuffs, highly, decorated, printed, labels, and, lower, prices, demand, for, canned, food, skyrocketed, during, world, war, i, as, military, commanders, sought, vast, quantities, of, cheap, high, calorie, food, to, feed, their, millions, of, soldiers, which, could, be, transported, safely, survive, trench, conditions, and, not, spoil, in, transport, throughout, the, war, british, soldiers, generally, subsisted, on, low, quality, canned, food, such, as, the, british, bully, beef, pork, and, beans, canned, sausages, and, maconochie, s, stew, but, by, 1916, widespread, dissatisfaction, and, increasing, complaints, about, the, poor, quality, canned, food, among, soldiers, resulted, in, militaries, seeking, better, quality, food, to, improve, morale, and, complete, meals, in, a, can, began, to, appear, in, 1917, the, french, army, began, issuing, canned, french, cuisine, such, as, coq, au, vin, beef, bourguignon, french, onion, soup, and, vichyssoise, while, the, italian, army, experimented, with, canned, ravioli, spaghetti, bolognese, minestrone, and, pasta, e, fagioli, after, the, war, companies, that, had, supplied, military, canned, food, began, to, improve, the, quality, of, their, goods, for, civilian, sale, the, original, fragile, and, heavy, glass, containers, presented, challenges, for, transportation, and, glass, jars, were, largely, replaced, in, commercial, canneries, with, cylindrical, tin, can, or, wrought, iron, canisters, later, shortened, to, cans, following, the, work, of, peter, durand, 1810, cans, are, cheaper, and, quicker, to, make, and, much, less, fragile, than, glass, jars, can, openers, were, not, invented, for, another, thirty, years, at, first, soldiers, would, cut, the, cans, open, with, bayonets, or, smash, them, open, with, rocks, today, tin, coated, steel, is, the, material, most, commonly, used, aseptically, processed, retort, pouches, are, also, used, for, canning, glass, jars, have, remained, popular, for, some, high, value, products, and, in, home, canning, to, prevent, the, food, from, being, spoiled, before, and, during, containment, a, number, of, methods, are, used, pasteurisation, boiling, and, other, applications, of, high, temperature, over, a, period, of, time, refrigeration, freezing, drying, vacuum, treatment, antimicrobial, agents, that, are, natural, to, the, recipe, of, the, foods, being, preserved, a, sufficient, dose, of, ionizing, radiation, submersion, in, a, strong, saline, solution, acid, base, osmotically, extreme, for, example, very, sugary, or, other, microbially, challenging, environments, other, than, sterilization, no, method, is, perfectly, dependable, as, a, preservative, sterilization, is, done, after, the, can, is, sealed, so, that, both, the, container, and, the, food, are, secured, the, spores, of, the, microorganism, clostridium, botulinum, which, causes, botulism, can, be, eliminated, only, at, temperatures, above, the, boiling, point, of, water, as, a, result, from, a, public, safety, point, of, view, foods, with, low, acidity, a, ph, more, than, 4, 6, need, sterilization, under, high, temperature, 116, 130, c, to, achieve, temperatures, above, the, boiling, point, requires, the, use, of, a, pressure, canner, foods, that, must, be, pressure, canned, include, most, vegetables, meat, seafood, poultry, and, dairy, products, the, only, foods, that, may, be, safely, canned, in, an, ordinary, boiling, water, bath, are, highly, acidic, ones, with, a, ph, below, 4, 6, such, as, fruits, pickled, vegetables, or, other, foods, to, which, acidic, additives, have, been, added, although, an, ordinary, boiling, temperature, does, not, kill, botulism, spores, the, acidity, is, enough, to, stop, them, from, growing, invented, in, 1888, by, max, ams, modern, double, seams, provide, an, airtight, seal, to, a, can, this, airtight, nature, is, crucial, to, keeping, micro, organisms, out, of, the, can, and, keeping, the, can, s, contents, sealed, inside, thus, double, seamed, cans, are, also, known, as, sanitary, cans, developed, in, 1900, in, europe, this, sort, of, can, was, made, of, the, traditional, cylindrical, body, made, with, tin, plate, the, two, ends, lids, were, attached, using, what, is, now, called, a, double, seam, a, can, thus, sealed, is, impervious, to, contamination, by, creating, two, tight, continuous, folds, between, the, can, s, cylindrical, body, and, the, lids, this, eliminated, the, need, for, solder, and, allowed, improvements, in, manufacturing, speed, reducing, cost, double, seaming, uses, rollers, to, shape, the, can, lid, and, the, final, double, seam, to, make, a, sanitary, can, and, lid, suitable, for, double, seaming, manufacture, begins, with, a, sheet, of, coated, tin, plate, to, create, the, can, body, rectangles, are, cut, and, curled, around, a, die, and, welded, together, creating, a, cylinder, with, a, side, seam, rollers, are, then, used, to, flare, out, one, or, both, ends, of, the, cylinder, to, create, a, quarter, circle, flange, around, the, circumference, precision, is, required, to, ensure, that, the, welded, sides, are, perfectly, aligned, as, any, misalignment, will, cause, inconsistent, flange, shape, compromising, its, integrity, a, circle, is, then, cut, from, the, sheet, using, a, die, cutter, the, circle, is, shaped, in, a, stamping, press, to, create, a, downward, countersink, to, fit, snugly, into, the, can, body, the, result, can, be, compared, to, an, upside, down, and, very, flat, top, hat, the, outer, edge, is, then, curled, down, and, around, about, 140, degrees, using, rollers, to, create, the, end, curl, the, result, is, a, steel, tube, with, a, flanged, edge, and, a, countersunk, steel, disc, with, a, curled, edge, a, rubber, compound, is, put, inside, the, curl, the, body, and, end, are, brought, together, in, a, seamer, and, held, in, place, by, the, base, plate, and, chuck, respectively, the, base, plate, provides, a, sure, footing, for, the, can, body, during, the, seaming, operation, and, the, chuck, fits, snugly, into, the, end, lid, the, result, is, the, countersink, of, the, end, sits, inside, the, top, of, the, can, body, just, below, the, flange, the, end, curl, protrudes, slightly, beyond, the, flange, once, brought, together, in, the, seamer, the, seaming, head, presses, a, first, operation, roller, against, the, end, curl, the, end, curl, is, pressed, against, the, flange, curling, it, in, toward, the, body, and, under, the, flange, the, flange, is, also, bent, downward, and, the, end, and, body, are, now, loosely, joined, the, first, operation, roller, is, then, retracted, at, this, point, five, thicknesses, of, steel, exist, in, the, seam, from, the, outside, in, they, are, the, seaming, head, then, engages, the, second, operation, roller, against, the, partly, formed, seam, the, second, operation, presses, all, five, steel, components, together, tightly, to, form, the, final, seal, the, five, layers, in, the, final, seam, are, then, called, a, end, b, body, hook, c, cover, hook, d, body, e, countersink, all, sanitary, cans, require, a, filling, medium, within, the, seam, because, otherwise, the, metal, to, metal, contact, will, not, maintain, a, hermetic, seal, in, most, cases, a, rubberized, compound, is, placed, inside, the, end, curl, radius, forming, the, critical, seal, between, the, end, and, the, body, probably, the, most, important, innovation, since, the, introduction, of, double, seams, is, the, welded, side, seam, prior, to, the, welded, side, seam, the, can, body, was, folded, and, or, soldered, together, leaving, a, relatively, thick, side, seam, the, thick, side, seam, required, that, the, side, seam, end, juncture, at, the, end, curl, to, have, more, metal, to, curl, around, before, closing, in, behind, the, body, hook, or, flange, with, a, greater, opportunity, for, error, many, different, parts, during, the, seaming, process, are, critical, in, ensuring, that, a, can, is, airtight, and, vacuum, sealed, the, dangers, of, a, can, that, is, not, hermetically, sealed, are, contamination, by, foreign, objects, bacteria, or, fungicide, sprays, or, that, the, can, could, leak, or, spoil, one, important, part, is, the, seamer, setup, this, process, is, usually, performed, by, an, experienced, technician, among, the, parts, that, need, setup, are, seamer, rolls, and, chucks, which, have, to, be, set, in, their, exact, position, using, a, feeler, gauge, or, a, clearance, gauge, the, lifter, pressure, and, position, roll, and, chuck, designs, tooling, wear, and, bearing, wear, all, contribute, to, a, good, double, seam, incorrect, setups, can, be, non, intuitive, for, example, due, to, the, springback, effect, a, seam, can, appear, loose, when, in, reality, it, was, closed, too, tight, and, has, opened, up, like, a, spring, for, this, reason, experienced, operators, and, good, seamer, setup, are, critical, to, ensure, that, double, seams, are, properly, closed, quality, control, usually, involves, taking, full, cans, from, the, line, one, per, seamer, head, at, least, once, or, twice, per, shift, and, performing, a, teardown, operation, wrinkle, tightness, mechanical, tests, external, thickness, seamer, length, height, and, countersink, as, well, as, cutting, the, seam, open, with, a, twin, blade, saw, and, measuring, with, a, double, seam, inspection, system, the, combination, of, these, measurements, will, determine, the, seam, s, quality, use, of, a, statistical, process, control, spc, software, in, conjunction, with, a, manual, double, seam, monitor, computerized, double, seam, scanner, or, even, a, fully, automatic, double, seam, inspection, system, makes, the, laborious, process, of, double, seam, inspection, faster, and, much, more, accurate, statistically, tracking, the, performance, of, each, head, or, seaming, station, of, the, can, seamer, allows, for, better, prediction, of, can, seamer, issues, and, may, be, used, to, plan, maintenance, when, convenient, rather, than, to, simply, react, after, bad, or, unsafe, cans, have, been, produced, canning, is, a, way, of, processing, food, to, extend, its, shelf, life, the, idea, is, to, make, food, available, and, edible, long, after, the, processing, time, a, 1997, study, found, that, canned, fruits, and, vegetables, are, as, rich, with, dietary, fiber, and, vitamins, as, the, same, corresponding, fresh, or, frozen, foods, and, in, some, cases, the, canned, products, are, richer, than, their, fresh, or, frozen, counterparts, the, heating, process, during, canning, appears, to, make, dietary, fiber, more, soluble, and, therefore, more, readily, fermented, in, the, colon, into, gases, and, physiologically, active, byproducts, canned, tomatoes, have, a, higher, available, lycopene, content, consequently, canned, meat, and, vegetables, are, often, among, the, list, of, food, items, that, are, stocked, during, emergencies, in, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, the, process, of, canning, foods, was, mainly, done, by, small, canneries, these, canneries, were, full, of, overlooked, sanitation, problems, such, as, poor, hygiene, and, unsanitary, work, environments, since, the, refrigerator, did, not, exist, and, industrial, canning, standards, were, not, set, in, place, it, was, very, common, for, contaminated, cans, to, slip, onto, the, grocery, store, shelves, according, to, the, fruits, of, empire, art, food, and, the, politics, of, race, in, the, age, of, american, expansion, by, shana, klein, workers, also, suffered, injuries, specifically, bruised, knuckles, and, open, sores, from, trimming, and, packaging, pineapples, gloves, were, one, preventative, measure, to, protect, a, canner, s, hands, from, the, acidity, of, the, pineapple, but, gloves, did, not, always, help, in, canning, toxicology, migration, is, the, movement, of, substances, from, the, can, itself, into, the, contents, potential, toxic, substances, that, can, migrate, are, lead, causing, lead, poisoning, or, bisphenol, a, bpa, a, potential, endocrine, disruptor, that, is, an, ingredient, in, the, epoxy, commonly, used, to, coat, the, inner, surface, of, cans, some, cans, are, manufactured, with, a, bpa, free, enamel, lining, produced, from, plant, oils, and, resins, in, february, 2018, the, can, manufacturers, institute, a, trade, association, in, the, united, states, surveyed, the, industry, and, reported, that, at, least, 90, of, food, cans, no, longer, contained, bpa, salt, sodium, chloride, dissolved, in, water, is, used, in, the, canning, process, as, a, result, canned, food, can, be, a, major, source, of, dietary, salt, too, much, salt, increases, the, risk, of, health, problems, including, high, blood, pressure, therefore, health, authorities, have, recommended, limitations, of, dietary, sodium, many, canned, products, are, available, in, low, salt, and, no, salt, alternatives, rinsing, thoroughly, after, opening, may, reduce, the, amount, of, salt, in, canned, vegetables, since, much, of, the, salt, content, is, thought, to, be, in, the, liquid, rather, than, the, food, itself, foodborne, botulism, results, from, contaminated, foodstuffs, in, which, c, botulinum, spores, have, been, allowed, to, germinate, and, produce, botulism, toxin, and, this, typically, occurs, in, canned, non, acidic, food, substances, that, have, not, received, a, strong, enough, thermal, heat, treatment, c, botulinum, prefers, low, oxygen, environments, and, is, a, poor, competitor, to, other, bacteria, but, its, spores, are, resistant, to, thermal, treatments, when, a, canned, food, is, sterilized, insufficiently, most, other, bacteria, besides, the, c, botulinum, spores, are, killed, and, the, spores, can, germinate, and, produce, botulism, toxin, botulism, is, a, rare, but, serious, paralytic, illness, leading, to, paralysis, that, typically, starts, with, the, muscles, of, the, face, and, then, spreads, towards, the, limbs, the, botulinum, toxin, is, extremely, dangerous, because, it, cannot, be, detected, by, sight, or, smell, and, ingestion, of, even, a, small, amount, of, the, toxin, can, be, deadly, in, severe, forms, it, leads, to, paralysis, of, the, breathing, muscles, and, causes, respiratory, failure, in, view, of, this, life, threatening, complication, all, suspected, cases, of, botulism, are, treated, as, medical, emergencies, and, public, health, officials, are, usually, involved, to, prevent, further, cases, from, the, same, source, canned, goods, and, canning, supplies, sell, particularly, well, in, times, of, recession, due, to, the, tendency, of, financially, stressed, individuals, to, engage, in, cocooning, a, term, used, by, retail, analysts, to, describe, the, phenomenon, in, which, people, choose, to, stay, at, home, instead, of, adding, expenditures, to, their, budget, by, dining, out, and, socializing, outside, the, home, also, some, people, may, become, preppers, and, proceed, to, stockpile, canned, food, a, doomer, would, also, be, interested, in, stockpiling, canned, food, upon, learning, about, a, recession, in, february, 2009, during, a, recession, the, united, states, saw, an, 11, 5, rise, in, sales, of, canning, related, items, some, communities, in, the, us, have, county, canning, centers, which, are, available, for, teaching, canning, or, shared, community, kitchens, which, can, be, rented, for, canning, one, s, own, foods
