gender, includes, the, social, psychological, cultural, and, behavioral, aspects, of, being, a, man, woman, or, other, gender, identity, depending, on, the, context, this, may, include, sex, based, social, constructs, i, e, gender, roles, as, well, as, gender, expression, most, cultures, use, a, gender, binary, in, which, gender, is, divided, into, two, categories, and, people, are, considered, part, of, one, or, the, other, girls, women, and, boys, men, those, who, are, outside, these, groups, may, fall, under, the, umbrella, term, non, binary, a, number, of, societies, have, specific, genders, besides, man, and, woman, such, as, the, hijras, of, south, asia, these, are, often, referred, to, as, third, genders, and, fourth, genders, etc, most, scholars, agree, that, gender, is, a, central, characteristic, for, social, organization, the, word, is, also, used, as, a, synonym, for, sex, and, the, balance, between, these, usages, has, shifted, over, time, in, the, mid, 20th, century, a, terminological, distinction, in, modern, english, known, as, the, sex, and, gender, distinction, between, biological, sex, and, gender, began, to, develop, in, the, academic, areas, of, psychology, sociology, sexology, and, feminism, before, the, mid, 20th, century, it, was, uncommon, to, use, the, word, gender, to, refer, to, anything, but, grammatical, categories, in, the, west, in, the, 1970s, feminist, theory, embraced, the, concept, of, a, distinction, between, biological, sex, and, the, social, construct, of, gender, the, distinction, between, gender, and, sex, is, made, by, most, contemporary, social, scientists, in, western, countries, behavioral, scientists, and, biologists, many, legal, systems, and, government, bodies, and, intergovernmental, agencies, such, as, the, who, the, social, sciences, have, a, branch, devoted, to, gender, studies, other, sciences, such, as, psychology, sociology, sexology, and, neuroscience, are, interested, in, the, subject, the, social, sciences, sometimes, approach, gender, as, a, social, construct, and, gender, studies, particularly, does, while, research, in, the, natural, sciences, investigates, whether, biological, differences, in, females, and, males, influence, the, development, of, gender, in, humans, both, inform, the, debate, about, how, far, biological, differences, influence, the, formation, of, gender, identity, and, gendered, behavior, biopsychosocial, approaches, to, gender, include, biological, psychological, and, social, cultural, aspects, the, modern, english, word, gender, comes, from, the, middle, english, gender, gendre, a, loanword, from, anglo, norman, and, middle, french, gendre, this, in, turn, came, from, latin, genus, both, words, mean, kind, type, or, sort, they, derive, ultimately, from, a, proto, indo, european, pie, root, nh, to, beget, which, is, also, the, source, of, kin, kind, king, and, many, other, english, words, with, cognates, widely, attested, in, many, indo, european, languages, it, appears, in, modern, french, in, the, word, genre, type, kind, also, genre, sexuel, and, is, related, to, the, greek, root, gen, to, produce, appearing, in, gene, genesis, and, oxygen, the, oxford, etymological, dictionary, of, the, english, language, of, 1882, defined, gender, as, kind, breed, sex, derived, from, the, latin, ablative, case, of, genus, like, genere, natus, which, refers, to, birth, the, first, edition, of, the, oxford, english, dictionary, oed1, volume, 4, 1900, notes, the, original, meaning, of, gender, as, kind, had, already, become, obsolete, the, concept, of, gender, in, the, modern, social, science, sense, is, a, recent, invention, in, human, history, the, ancient, world, had, no, basis, of, understanding, gender, as, it, has, been, understood, in, the, humanities, and, social, sciences, for, the, past, few, decades, the, term, gender, had, been, associated, with, grammar, for, most, of, history, and, only, started, to, move, towards, it, being, a, malleable, cultural, construct, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, before, the, terminological, distinction, between, biological, sex, and, gender, as, a, role, developed, it, was, uncommon, to, use, the, word, gender, to, refer, to, anything, but, grammatical, categories, for, example, in, a, bibliography, of, 12, 000, references, on, marriage, and, family, from, 1900, to, 1964, the, term, gender, does, not, even, emerge, once, analysis, of, more, than, 30, million, academic, article, titles, from, 1945, to, 2001, showed, that, the, uses, of, the, term, gender, were, much, rarer, than, uses, of, sex, was, often, used, as, a, grammatical, category, early, in, this, period, by, the, end, of, this, period, uses, of, gender, outnumbered, uses, of, sex, in, the, social, sciences, arts, and, humanities, it, was, in, the, 1970s, that, feminist, scholars, adopted, the, term, gender, as, way, of, distinguishing, socially, constructed, aspects, of, male, female, differences, gender, from, biologically, determined, aspects, sex, as, of, 2024, many, dictionaries, list, synonym, for, sex, as, one, of, gender, s, meanings, alongside, its, sociocultural, meaning, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, gender, came, into, use, as, a, synonym, for, sex, during, the, twentieth, century, initially, as, a, euphemism, as, sex, was, undergoing, its, own, usage, shift, toward, referring, to, sexual, intercourse, rather, than, male, female, categories, during, the, last, two, decades, of, the, 20th, century, gender, was, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, sex, in, its, non, copulatory, senses, especially, outside, the, social, sciences, david, haig, writing, in, 2003, said, the, sex, gender, distinction, is, now, only, fitfully, observed, within, the, social, sciences, however, use, of, gender, in, academia, increased, greatly, outnumbering, uses, of, sex, during, that, same, period, in, the, natural, sciences, gender, was, more, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, sex, this, can, be, attributed, to, the, influence, of, feminism, haig, stated, among, the, reasons, that, working, scientists, have, given, me, for, choosing, gender, rather, than, sex, in, biological, contexts, are, desires, to, signal, sympathy, with, feminist, goals, to, use, a, more, academic, term, or, to, avoid, the, connotation, of, copulation, haig, also, notes, that, gender, became, the, preferred, term, when, discussing, phenomena, for, which, the, social, versus, biological, cause, was, unknown, disputed, or, actually, an, interaction, between, the, two, in, 1993, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, fda, started, to, use, gender, instead, of, sex, to, avoid, confusion, with, sexual, intercourse, later, in, 2011, the, fda, reversed, its, position, and, began, using, sex, as, the, biological, classification, and, gender, as, a, person, s, self, representation, as, male, or, female, or, how, that, person, is, responded, to, by, social, institutions, based, on, the, individual, s, gender, presentation, in, legal, cases, alleging, discrimination, a, 2006, law, review, article, by, meredith, render, notes, as, notions, of, gender, and, sexuality, have, evolved, over, the, last, few, decades, legal, theories, concerning, what, it, means, to, discriminate, because, of, sex, under, title, vii, have, experienced, a, similar, evolution, 135, in, a, 1999, law, review, article, proposing, a, legal, definition, of, sex, that, emphasizes, gender, self, identification, julie, greenberg, writes, most, legislation, utilizes, the, word, sex, yet, courts, legislators, and, administrative, agencies, often, substitute, the, word, gender, for, sex, when, they, interpret, these, statutes, 270, 274, in, j, e, b, v, alabama, ex, rel, t, b, a, 1994, united, states, supreme, court, case, addressing, whether, the, equal, protection, clause, forbids, intentional, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, gender, the, majority, opinion, noted, that, with, regard, to, gender, it, is, necessary, only, to, acknowledge, that, our, nation, has, had, a, long, and, unfortunate, history, of, sex, discrimination, id, at, 684, 93, s, ct, at, 1769, a, history, which, warrants, the, heightened, scrutiny, we, afford, all, gender, based, classifications, today, and, stated, when, state, actors, exercise, peremptory, challenges, in, reliance, on, gender, stereotypes, they, ratify, and, reinforce, prejudicial, views, of, the, relative, abilities, of, men, and, women, the, word, was, still, widely, used, however, in, the, specific, sense, of, grammatical, gender, the, assignment, of, nouns, to, categories, such, as, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, according, to, aristotle, this, concept, was, introduced, by, the, greek, philosopher, protagoras, in, 1926, henry, watson, fowler, stated, that, the, definition, of, the, word, pertained, to, this, grammar, related, meaning, gender, is, a, grammatical, term, only, to, talk, of, persons, of, the, masculine, or, feminine, g, meaning, of, the, male, or, female, sex, is, either, a, jocularity, permissible, or, not, according, to, context, or, a, blunder, in, 1945, madison, bentley, defined, gender, as, the, socialized, obverse, of, sex, simone, de, beauvoir, s, 1949, book, the, second, sex, has, been, interpreted, as, the, beginning, of, the, distinction, between, sex, and, gender, in, feminist, theory, although, this, interpretation, is, contested, by, many, feminist, theorists, including, sara, hein, maa, controversial, sexologist, john, money, coined, the, term, gender, role, and, was, the, first, to, use, it, in, print, in, a, scientific, trade, journal, in, 1955, in, the, seminal, 1955, paper, he, defined, it, as, all, those, things, that, a, person, says, or, does, to, disclose, himself, or, herself, as, having, the, status, of, boy, or, man, girl, or, woman, the, modern, academic, sense, of, the, word, in, the, context, of, social, roles, of, men, and, women, dates, at, least, back, to, 1945, and, was, popularized, and, developed, by, the, feminist, movement, from, the, 1970s, onwards, see, feminist, theory, and, gender, studies, below, which, theorizes, that, human, nature, is, essentially, epicene, and, social, distinctions, based, on, sex, are, arbitrarily, constructed, in, this, context, matters, pertaining, to, this, theoretical, process, of, social, construction, were, labelled, matters, of, gender, the, popular, use, of, gender, simply, as, an, alternative, to, sex, as, a, biological, category, is, also, widespread, although, attempts, are, still, made, to, preserve, the, distinction, the, american, heritage, dictionary, 2000, uses, the, following, two, sentences, to, illustrate, the, difference, noting, that, the, distinction, is, useful, in, principle, but, it, is, by, no, means, widely, observed, and, considerable, variation, in, usage, occurs, at, all, levels, the, effectiveness, of, the, medication, appears, to, depend, on, the, sex, not, gender, of, the, patient, in, peasant, societies, gender, not, sex, roles, are, likely, to, be, more, clearly, defined, gender, identity, refers, to, a, personal, identification, with, a, particular, gender, and, gender, role, in, society, the, term, woman, has, historically, been, used, interchangeably, with, reference, to, the, female, body, though, more, recently, this, usage, has, been, viewed, as, controversial, by, some, feminists, there, are, qualitative, analyses, that, explore, and, present, the, representations, of, gender, however, feminists, challenge, these, dominant, ideologies, concerning, gender, roles, and, biological, sex, one, s, biological, sex, is, often, times, tied, to, specific, social, roles, and, expectations, judith, butler, considers, the, concept, of, being, a, woman, to, have, more, challenges, owing, not, only, to, society, s, viewing, women, as, a, social, category, but, also, as, a, felt, sense, of, self, a, culturally, conditioned, or, constructed, subjective, identity, social, identity, refers, to, the, common, identification, with, a, collectivity, or, social, category, that, creates, a, common, culture, among, participants, concerned, according, to, social, identity, theory, an, important, component, of, the, self, concept, is, derived, from, memberships, in, social, groups, and, categories, this, is, demonstrated, by, group, processes, and, how, inter, group, relationships, impact, significantly, on, individuals, self, perception, and, behaviors, the, groups, people, belong, to, therefore, provide, members, with, the, definition, of, who, they, are, and, how, they, should, behave, within, their, social, sphere, categorizing, males, and, females, into, social, roles, creates, a, problem, for, some, individuals, who, feel, they, have, to, be, at, one, end, of, a, linear, spectrum, and, must, identify, themselves, as, man, or, woman, rather, than, being, allowed, to, choose, a, section, in, between, globally, communities, interpret, biological, differences, between, men, and, women, to, create, a, set, of, social, expectations, that, define, the, behaviors, that, are, appropriate, for, men, and, women, and, determine, their, different, access, to, rights, resources, power, in, society, and, health, behaviors, although, the, specific, nature, and, degree, of, these, differences, vary, from, one, society, to, the, next, they, still, tend, to, typically, favor, men, creating, an, imbalance, in, power, and, gender, inequalities, within, most, societies, many, cultures, have, different, systems, of, norms, and, beliefs, based, on, gender, but, there, is, no, universal, standard, to, a, masculine, or, feminine, role, across, all, cultures, social, roles, of, men, and, women, in, relation, to, each, other, is, based, on, the, cultural, norms, of, that, society, which, lead, to, the, creation, of, gender, systems, the, gender, system, is, the, basis, of, social, patterns, in, many, societies, which, include, the, separation, of, sexes, and, the, primacy, of, masculine, norms, philosopher, michel, foucault, said, that, as, sexual, subjects, humans, are, the, object, of, power, which, is, not, an, institution, or, structure, rather, it, is, a, signifier, or, name, attributed, to, complex, strategical, situation, because, of, this, power, is, what, determines, individual, attributes, behaviors, etc, and, people, are, a, part, of, an, ontologically, and, epistemologically, constructed, set, of, names, and, labels, for, example, being, female, characterizes, one, as, a, woman, and, being, a, woman, signifies, one, as, weak, emotional, and, irrational, and, incapable, of, actions, attributed, to, a, man, butler, said, that, gender, and, sex, are, more, like, verbs, than, nouns, she, reasoned, that, her, actions, are, limited, because, she, is, female, i, am, not, permitted, to, construct, my, gender, and, sex, willy, nilly, she, said, is, so, because, gender, is, politically, and, therefore, socially, controlled, rather, than, woman, being, something, one, is, it, is, something, one, does, more, recent, criticisms, of, judith, butler, s, theories, critique, her, writing, for, reinforcing, the, very, conventional, dichotomies, of, gender, according, to, gender, theorist, kate, bornstein, gender, can, have, ambiguity, and, fluidity, there, are, two, contrasting, ideas, regarding, the, definition, of, gender, and, the, intersection, of, both, of, them, is, definable, as, below, the, world, health, organization, defines, gender, as, the, characteristics, of, women, men, girls, and, boys, that, are, socially, constructed, the, beliefs, values, and, attitude, taken, up, and, exhibited, by, them, is, as, per, the, agreed, upon, norms, of, the, society, and, the, personal, opinion, of, the, person, is, not, taken, into, the, primary, consideration, of, assignment, of, gender, and, imposition, of, gender, roles, as, per, the, assigned, gender, the, assignment, of, gender, involves, taking, into, account, the, physiological, and, biological, attributes, assigned, by, nature, followed, by, the, imposition, of, the, socially, constructed, conduct, gender, is, a, term, used, to, exemplify, the, attributes, that, a, society, or, culture, constitutes, as, masculine, or, feminine, although, a, person, s, sex, as, male, or, female, stands, as, a, biological, fact, that, is, identical, in, any, culture, what, that, specific, sex, means, in, reference, to, a, person, s, gender, role, as, a, man, or, a, woman, in, society, varies, cross, culturally, according, to, what, things, are, considered, to, be, masculine, or, feminine, these, roles, are, learned, from, various, intersecting, sources, such, as, parental, influences, the, socialization, a, child, receives, in, school, and, what, is, portrayed, in, the, local, media, learning, gender, roles, starts, from, birth, and, includes, seemingly, simple, things, like, what, color, outfits, a, baby, is, clothed, in, or, what, toys, they, are, given, to, play, with, however, a, person, s, gender, does, not, always, align, with, what, has, been, assigned, at, birth, factors, other, than, learned, behaviors, play, a, role, in, the, development, of, gender, the, article, adolescent, gender, role, identity, and, mental, health, gender, intensification, revisited, focuses, on, the, work, of, heather, a, priess, sara, m, lindberg, and, janet, shibley, hyde, on, whether, or, not, girls, and, boys, diverge, in, their, gender, identities, during, adolescent, years, the, researchers, based, their, work, on, ideas, previously, mentioned, by, hill, and, lynch, in, their, gender, intensification, hypothesis, in, that, signals, and, messages, from, parents, determine, and, affect, their, children, s, gender, role, identities, this, hypothesis, argues, that, parents, affect, their, children, s, gender, role, identities, and, that, different, interactions, spent, with, either, parents, will, affect, gender, intensification, priess, and, among, other, s, study, did, not, support, the, hypothesis, of, hill, and, lynch, which, stated, that, as, adolescents, experience, these, and, other, socializing, influences, they, will, become, more, stereotypical, in, their, gender, role, identities, and, gendered, attitudes, and, behaviors, however, the, researchers, did, state, that, perhaps, the, hypothesis, hill, and, lynch, proposed, was, true, in, the, past, but, is, not, true, now, due, to, changes, in, the, population, of, teens, in, respect, to, their, gender, role, identities, authors, of, unpacking, the, gender, system, a, theoretical, perspective, on, gender, beliefs, and, social, relations, cecilia, ridgeway, and, shelley, correll, argue, that, gender, is, more, than, an, identity, or, role, but, is, something, that, is, institutionalized, through, social, relational, contexts, ridgeway, and, correll, define, social, relational, contexts, as, any, situation, in, which, individuals, define, themselves, in, relation, to, others, in, order, to, act, they, also, point, out, that, in, addition, to, social, relational, contexts, cultural, beliefs, plays, a, role, in, the, gender, system, the, coauthors, argue, that, daily, people, are, forced, to, acknowledge, and, interact, with, others, in, ways, that, are, related, to, gender, every, day, individuals, are, interacting, with, each, other, and, comply, with, society, s, set, standard, of, hegemonic, beliefs, which, includes, gender, roles, they, state, that, society, s, hegemonic, cultural, beliefs, sets, the, rules, which, in, turn, create, the, setting, for, which, social, relational, contexts, are, to, take, place, ridgeway, and, correll, then, shift, their, topic, towards, sex, categorization, the, authors, define, sex, categorization, as, the, sociocognitive, process, by, which, we, label, another, as, male, or, female, the, failure, of, an, attempt, to, raise, david, reimer, from, infancy, through, adolescence, as, a, girl, after, his, genitals, were, accidentally, mutilated, is, cited, as, disproving, the, theory, that, gender, identity, is, determined, solely, by, parenting, reimer, s, case, is, used, by, organizations, such, as, the, intersex, society, of, north, america, to, caution, against, needlessly, modifying, the, genitals, of, unconsenting, minors, between, the, 1960s, and, 2000, many, other, male, newborns, and, infants, were, surgically, and, socially, reassigned, as, females, if, they, were, born, with, malformed, penises, or, if, they, lost, their, penises, in, accidents, at, the, time, surgical, reconstruction, of, the, vagina, was, more, advanced, than, reconstruction, of, the, penis, leading, many, doctors, and, psychologists, including, john, money, who, oversaw, reimer, s, case, to, recommend, sex, reassignment, based, on, the, idea, that, these, patients, would, be, happiest, living, as, women, with, functioning, genitalia, available, evidence, indicates, that, in, such, instances, parents, were, deeply, committed, to, raising, these, children, as, girls, and, in, as, gender, typical, a, manner, as, possible, 72, 73, a, 2005, review, of, these, cases, found, that, about, half, of, natal, males, reassigned, female, lived, as, women, in, adulthood, including, those, who, knew, their, medical, history, suggesting, that, gender, assignment, and, related, social, factors, has, a, major, though, not, determinative, influence, on, eventual, gender, identity, in, 2015, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, released, a, webinar, series, on, gender, gender, identity, gender, expression, transgender, etc, in, the, first, lecture, sherer, explains, that, parents, influence, through, punishment, and, reward, of, behavior, can, influence, gender, expression, but, not, gender, identity, sherer, argued, that, kids, will, modify, their, gender, expression, to, seek, reward, from, their, parents, and, society, but, this, will, not, affect, their, gender, identity, their, internal, sense, of, self, sexologist, john, money, coined, the, term, gender, role, in, 1955, the, term, gender, role, is, defined, as, the, actions, or, responses, that, may, reveal, their, status, as, boy, man, girl, or, woman, respectively, elements, surrounding, gender, roles, include, clothing, speech, patterns, movement, occupations, and, other, factors, not, limited, to, biological, sex, in, contrast, to, taxonomic, approaches, some, feminist, philosophers, have, argued, that, gender, is, a, vast, orchestration, of, subtle, mediations, between, oneself, and, others, rather, than, a, private, cause, behind, manifest, behaviours, historically, most, societies, have, recognized, only, two, distinct, broad, classes, of, gender, roles, a, binary, of, masculine, and, feminine, largely, corresponding, to, the, biological, sexes, of, male, and, female, when, a, baby, is, born, society, allocates, the, child, to, one, gender, or, the, other, on, the, basis, of, what, their, genitals, resemble, however, some, societies, have, historically, acknowledged, and, even, honored, people, who, fulfill, a, gender, role, that, exists, more, in, the, middle, of, the, continuum, between, the, feminine, and, masculine, polarity, for, example, the, hawaiian, m, h, who, occupy, a, place, in, the, middle, between, male, and, female, or, the, ojibwe, ikwekaazo, men, who, choose, to, function, as, women, or, ininiikaazo, women, who, function, as, men, in, the, language, of, the, sociology, of, gender, some, of, these, people, may, be, considered, third, gender, especially, by, those, in, gender, studies, or, anthropology, contemporary, native, american, and, fnim, people, who, fulfill, these, traditional, roles, in, their, communities, may, also, participate, in, the, modern, two, spirit, community, however, these, umbrella, terms, neologisms, and, ways, of, viewing, gender, are, not, necessarily, the, type, of, cultural, constructs, that, more, traditional, members, of, these, communities, agree, with, the, hijras, of, india, and, pakistan, are, often, cited, as, third, gender, another, example, may, be, the, muxe, pronounced, found, in, the, state, of, oaxaca, in, southern, mexico, the, bugis, people, of, sulawesi, indonesia, have, a, tradition, that, incorporates, all, the, features, above, in, addition, to, these, traditionally, recognized, third, genders, many, cultures, now, recognize, to, differing, degrees, various, non, binary, gender, identities, people, who, are, non, binary, or, genderqueer, have, gender, identities, that, are, not, exclusively, masculine, or, feminine, they, may, identify, as, having, an, overlap, of, gender, identities, having, two, or, more, genders, having, no, gender, having, a, fluctuating, gender, identity, or, being, third, gender, or, other, gendered, recognition, of, non, binary, genders, is, still, somewhat, new, to, mainstream, western, culture, and, non, binary, people, may, face, increased, risk, of, assault, harassment, and, discrimination, two, instruments, incorporating, the, multidimensional, nature, of, masculinity, and, femininity, have, dominated, gender, identity, research, the, bem, sex, role, inventory, bsri, and, the, personal, attributes, questionnaire, paq, both, instruments, categorize, individuals, as, either, being, sex, typed, males, report, themselves, as, identifying, primarily, with, masculine, traits, females, report, themselves, as, identifying, primarily, with, feminine, traits, cross, sex, typed, males, report, themselves, as, identifying, primarily, with, feminine, traits, females, report, themselves, as, identifying, primarily, with, masculine, traits, androgynous, either, males, or, females, who, report, themselves, as, high, on, both, masculine, and, feminine, traits, or, undifferentiated, either, males, or, females, who, report, themselves, as, low, on, both, masculine, and, feminine, traits, twenge, 1997, noted, that, men, are, generally, more, masculine, than, women, and, women, generally, more, feminine, than, men, but, the, association, between, biological, sex, and, masculinity, femininity, is, waning, some, gendered, behavior, is, influenced, by, prenatal, and, early, life, androgen, exposure, this, includes, for, example, gender, normative, play, self, identification, with, a, gender, and, tendency, to, engage, in, aggressive, behavior, males, of, most, mammals, including, humans, exhibit, more, rough, and, tumble, play, behavior, which, is, influenced, by, maternal, testosterone, levels, these, levels, may, also, influence, sexuality, with, non, heterosexual, persons, exhibiting, sex, atypical, behavior, in, childhood, the, biology, of, gender, became, the, subject, of, an, expanding, number, of, studies, over, the, course, of, the, late, 20th, century, one, of, the, earliest, areas, of, interest, was, what, became, known, as, gender, identity, disorder, gid, and, which, is, now, also, described, as, gender, dysphoria, studies, in, this, and, related, areas, inform, the, following, summary, of, the, subject, by, john, money, he, stated, the, term, gender, role, appeared, in, print, first, in, 1955, the, term, gender, identity, was, used, in, a, press, release, 21, november, 1966, to, announce, the, new, clinic, for, transsexuals, at, the, johns, hopkins, hospital, it, was, disseminated, in, the, media, worldwide, and, soon, entered, the, vernacular, the, definitions, of, gender, and, gender, identity, vary, on, a, doctrinal, basis, in, popularized, and, scientifically, debased, usage, sex, is, what, you, are, biologically, gender, is, what, you, become, socially, gender, identity, is, your, own, sense, or, conviction, of, maleness, or, femaleness, and, gender, role, is, the, cultural, stereotype, of, what, is, masculine, and, feminine, causality, with, respect, to, gender, identity, disorder, is, sub, divisible, into, genetic, prenatal, hormonal, postnatal, social, and, post, pubertal, hormonal, determinants, but, there, is, as, yet, no, comprehensive, and, detailed, theory, of, causality, gender, coding, in, the, brain, is, bipolar, in, gender, identity, disorder, there, is, discordance, between, the, natal, sex, of, one, s, external, genitalia, and, the, brain, coding, of, one, s, gender, as, masculine, or, feminine, although, causation, from, the, biological, genetic, and, hormonal, to, the, behavioral, has, been, broadly, demonstrated, and, accepted, money, is, careful, to, also, note, that, understanding, of, the, causal, chains, from, biology, to, behavior, in, sex, and, gender, issues, is, very, far, from, complete, money, had, previously, stated, that, in, the, 1950s, american, teenage, girls, who, had, been, exposed, to, androgenic, steroids, by, their, mothers, in, utero, exhibited, more, traditionally, masculine, behavior, such, as, being, more, concerned, about, their, future, career, than, marriage, wearing, pants, and, not, being, interested, in, jewelry, there, are, studies, concerning, women, who, have, a, condition, called, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, which, leads, to, the, overproduction, of, the, masculine, sex, hormone, androgen, these, women, usually, have, ordinary, female, appearances, though, nearly, all, girls, with, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, cah, have, corrective, surgery, performed, on, their, genitals, however, despite, taking, hormone, balancing, medication, given, to, them, at, birth, these, females, are, statistically, more, likely, to, be, interested, in, activities, traditionally, linked, to, males, than, female, activities, psychology, professor, and, cah, researcher, dr, sheri, berenbaum, attributes, these, differences, to, an, exposure, of, higher, levels, of, male, sex, hormones, in, utero, in, non, human, animal, research, gender, is, commonly, used, to, refer, to, the, biological, sex, of, the, animals, according, to, biologist, michael, j, ryan, gender, identity, is, a, concept, exclusively, applied, to, humans, also, in, a, letter, ellen, ketterson, writes, hen, asked, my, colleagues, in, the, department, of, gender, studies, agreed, that, the, term, gender, could, be, properly, applied, only, to, humans, because, it, involves, one, s, self, concept, as, man, or, woman, sex, is, a, biological, concept, gender, is, a, human, social, and, cultural, concept, however, poiani, 2010, notes, that, the, question, of, whether, behavioural, similarities, across, species, can, be, associated, with, gender, identity, or, not, is, an, issue, of, no, easy, resolution, and, suggests, that, mental, states, such, as, gender, identity, are, more, accessible, in, humans, than, other, species, due, to, their, capacity, for, language, poiani, suggests, that, the, potential, number, of, species, with, members, possessing, a, gender, identity, must, be, limited, due, to, the, requirement, for, self, consciousness, jacques, balthazart, suggests, that, there, is, no, animal, model, for, studying, sexual, identity, it, is, impossible, to, ask, an, animal, whatever, its, species, to, what, sex, it, belongs, he, notes, that, this, would, imply, that, the, animal, is, aware, of, its, own, body, and, sex, which, is, far, from, proved, despite, recent, research, demonstrating, sophisticated, cognitive, skills, among, non, human, primates, and, other, species, hird, 2006, has, also, stated, that, whether, or, not, non, human, animals, consider, themselves, to, be, feminine, or, masculine, is, a, difficult, if, not, impossible, question, to, answer, as, this, would, require, judgements, about, what, constitutes, femininity, or, masculinity, in, any, given, species, nonetheless, she, asserts, that, non, human, animals, do, experience, femininity, and, masculinity, to, the, extent, that, any, given, species, behaviour, is, gender, segregated, despite, this, poiani, and, dixson, emphasise, the, applicability, of, the, concept, of, gender, role, to, non, human, animals, such, as, rodents, throughout, their, book, the, concept, of, gender, role, has, also, been, applied, to, non, human, primates, such, as, rhesus, monkeys, biologist, and, feminist, academic, anne, fausto, sterling, rejects, the, discourse, of, biological, versus, social, determinism, and, advocates, a, deeper, analysis, of, how, interactions, between, the, biological, being, and, the, social, environment, influence, individuals, capacities, the, philosopher, and, feminist, simone, de, beauvoir, applied, existentialism, to, women, s, experience, of, life, one, is, not, born, a, woman, one, becomes, one, in, context, this, is, a, philosophical, statement, however, it, may, be, analyzed, in, terms, of, biology, a, girl, must, pass, puberty, to, become, a, woman, and, sociology, as, a, great, deal, of, mature, relating, in, social, contexts, is, learned, rather, than, instinctive, within, feminist, theory, terminology, for, gender, issues, developed, over, the, 1970s, in, the, 1974, edition, of, masculine, feminine, or, human, the, author, uses, innate, gender, and, learned, sex, roles, but, in, the, 1978, edition, the, use, of, sex, and, gender, is, reversed, by, 1980, most, feminist, writings, had, agreed, on, using, gender, only, for, socioculturally, adapted, traits, gender, studies, is, a, field, of, interdisciplinary, study, and, academic, field, devoted, to, gender, gender, identity, and, gendered, representation, as, central, categories, of, analysis, this, field, includes, women, s, studies, concerning, women, feminity, their, gender, roles, and, politics, and, feminism, men, s, studies, concerning, men, masculinity, their, gender, roles, and, politics, and, lgbt, studies, sometimes, gender, studies, is, offered, together, with, study, of, sexuality, these, disciplines, study, gender, and, sexuality, in, the, fields, of, literature, and, language, history, political, science, sociology, anthropology, cinema, and, media, studies, human, development, law, and, medicine, it, also, analyses, race, ethnicity, location, nationality, and, disability, in, gender, studies, the, term, gender, refers, to, proposed, social, and, cultural, constructions, of, masculinities, and, femininities, in, this, context, gender, explicitly, excludes, reference, to, biological, differences, to, focus, on, cultural, differences, this, emerged, from, a, number, of, different, areas, in, sociology, during, the, 1950s, from, the, theories, of, the, psychoanalyst, jacques, lacan, and, in, the, work, of, french, psychoanalysts, like, julia, kristeva, luce, irigaray, and, american, feminists, such, as, judith, butler, those, who, followed, butler, came, to, regard, gender, roles, as, a, practice, sometimes, referred, to, as, performative, charles, e, hurst, states, that, some, people, think, sex, will, automatically, determine, one, s, gender, demeanor, and, role, social, as, well, as, one, s, sexual, orientation, sexual, attractions, and, behavior, gender, sociologists, believe, that, people, have, cultural, origins, and, habits, for, dealing, with, gender, for, example, michael, schwalbe, believes, that, humans, must, be, taught, how, to, act, appropriately, in, their, designated, gender, to, fill, the, role, properly, and, that, the, way, people, behave, as, masculine, or, feminine, interacts, with, social, expectations, schwalbe, comments, that, humans, are, the, results, of, many, people, embracing, and, acting, on, similar, ideas, people, do, this, through, everything, from, clothing, and, hairstyle, to, relationship, and, employment, choices, schwalbe, believes, that, these, distinctions, are, important, because, society, wants, to, identify, and, categorize, people, as, soon, as, we, see, them, they, need, to, place, people, into, distinct, categories, to, know, how, we, should, feel, about, them, hurst, comments, that, in, a, society, where, we, present, our, genders, so, distinctly, there, can, often, be, severe, consequences, for, breaking, these, cultural, norms, many, of, these, consequences, are, rooted, in, discrimination, based, on, sexual, orientation, gays, and, lesbians, are, often, discriminated, against, in, our, legal, system, because, of, societal, prejudices, hurst, describes, how, this, discrimination, works, against, people, for, breaking, gender, norms, no, matter, what, their, sexual, orientation, is, he, says, that, courts, often, confuse, sex, gender, and, sexual, orientation, and, confuse, them, in, a, way, that, results, in, denying, the, rights, not, only, of, gays, and, lesbians, but, also, of, those, who, do, not, present, themselves, or, act, in, a, manner, traditionally, expected, of, their, sex, this, prejudice, plays, out, in, our, legal, system, when, a, person, is, judged, differently, because, they, do, not, present, themselves, as, the, correct, gender, andrea, dworkin, stated, her, commitment, to, destroying, male, dominance, and, gender, itself, while, stating, her, belief, in, radical, feminism, political, scientist, mary, hawkesworth, addresses, gender, and, feminist, theory, stating, that, since, the, 1970s, the, concept, of, gender, has, transformed, and, been, used, in, significantly, different, ways, within, feminist, scholarship, she, notes, that, a, transition, occurred, when, several, feminist, scholars, such, as, sandra, harding, and, joan, scott, began, to, conceive, of, gender, as, an, analytic, category, within, which, humans, think, about, and, organize, their, social, activity, feminist, scholars, in, political, science, began, employing, gender, as, an, analytical, category, which, highlighted, social, and, political, relations, neglected, by, mainstream, accounts, however, hawkesworth, states, feminist, political, science, has, not, become, a, dominant, paradigm, within, the, discipline, american, political, scientist, karen, beckwith, addresses, the, concept, of, gender, within, political, science, arguing, that, a, common, language, of, gender, exists, and, that, it, must, be, explicitly, articulated, in, order, to, build, upon, it, within, the, political, science, discipline, beckwith, describes, two, ways, in, which, the, political, scientist, may, employ, gender, when, conducting, empirical, research, gender, as, a, category, and, as, a, process, employing, gender, as, a, category, allows, for, political, scientists, to, delineate, specific, contexts, where, behaviours, actions, attitudes, and, preferences, considered, masculine, or, feminine, result, in, particular, political, outcomes, it, may, also, demonstrate, how, gender, differences, not, necessarily, corresponding, precisely, with, sex, may, constrain, or, facilitate, political, actors, gender, as, a, process, has, two, central, manifestations, in, political, science, research, firstly, in, determining, the, differential, effects, of, structures, and, policies, upon, men, and, women, and, secondly, the, ways, in, which, masculine, and, feminine, political, actors, actively, work, to, produce, favorable, gendered, outcomes, with, regard, to, gender, studies, jacquetta, newman, states, that, although, sex, is, determined, biologically, the, ways, in, which, people, express, gender, is, not, gendering, is, a, socially, constructed, process, based, on, culture, though, often, cultural, expectations, around, women, and, men, have, a, direct, relationship, to, their, biology, because, of, this, newman, argues, many, privilege, sex, as, being, a, cause, of, oppression, and, ignore, other, issues, like, race, ability, poverty, etc, current, gender, studies, classes, seek, to, move, away, from, that, and, examine, the, intersectionality, of, these, factors, in, determining, people, s, lives, she, also, points, out, that, other, non, western, cultures, do, not, necessarily, have, the, same, views, of, gender, and, gender, roles, newman, also, debates, the, meaning, of, equality, which, is, often, considered, the, goal, of, feminism, she, believes, that, equality, is, a, problematic, term, because, it, can, mean, many, different, things, such, as, people, being, treated, identically, differently, or, fairly, based, on, their, gender, newman, believes, this, is, problematic, because, there, is, no, unified, definition, as, to, what, equality, means, or, looks, like, and, that, this, can, be, significantly, important, in, areas, like, public, policy, the, world, health, organization, states, as, a, social, construct, gender, varies, from, society, to, society, and, can, change, over, time, sociologists, generally, regard, gender, as, a, social, construct, for, instance, sexologist, john, money, suggests, the, distinction, between, biological, sex, and, gender, as, a, role, moreover, ann, oakley, a, professor, of, sociology, and, social, policy, says, the, constancy, of, sex, must, be, admitted, but, so, also, must, the, variability, of, gender, lynda, birke, a, feminist, biologist, maintains, biology, is, not, seen, as, something, which, might, change, however, there, are, scholars, who, argue, that, sex, is, also, socially, constructed, for, example, gender, studies, writer, judith, butler, states, that, perhaps, this, construct, called, sex, is, as, culturally, constructed, as, gender, indeed, perhaps, it, was, always, already, gender, with, the, consequence, that, the, distinction, between, sex, and, gender, turns, out, to, be, no, distinction, at, all, she, continues, it, would, make, no, sense, then, to, define, gender, as, the, cultural, interpretation, of, sex, if, sex, is, itself, a, gender, centered, category, gender, should, not, be, conceived, merely, as, the, cultural, inscription, of, meaning, based, on, a, given, sex, a, juridical, conception, gender, must, also, designate, the, very, apparatus, of, production, whereby, the, sexes, themselves, are, established, this, production, of, sex, as, the, pre, discursive, should, be, understood, as, the, effect, of, the, apparatus, of, cultural, construction, designated, by, gender, butler, argues, that, bodies, only, appear, only, endure, only, live, within, the, productive, constraints, of, certain, highly, gendered, regulatory, schemas, and, sex, is, no, longer, as, a, bodily, given, on, which, the, construct, of, gender, is, artificially, imposed, but, as, a, cultural, norm, which, governs, the, materialization, of, bodies, with, regard, to, history, linda, nicholson, a, professor, of, history, and, women, s, studies, argues, that, the, understanding, of, human, bodies, as, sexually, dimorphic, was, historically, not, recognised, she, states, that, male, and, female, genitals, were, considered, inherently, the, same, in, western, society, until, the, 18th, century, at, that, time, female, genitals, were, regarded, as, incomplete, male, genitals, and, the, difference, between, the, two, was, conceived, as, a, matter, of, degree, in, other, words, there, was, a, belief, in, a, gradation, of, physical, forms, or, a, spectrum, scholars, such, as, helen, king, joan, cadden, and, michael, stolberg, have, criticized, this, interpretation, of, history, cadden, notes, that, the, one, sex, model, was, disputed, even, in, ancient, and, medieval, medicine, and, stolberg, points, out, that, already, in, the, sixteenth, century, medicine, had, begun, to, move, towards, a, two, sex, model, in, addition, drawing, from, the, empirical, research, of, intersex, children, anne, fausto, sterling, a, professor, of, biology, and, gender, studies, describes, how, the, doctors, address, the, issues, of, intersexuality, she, starts, her, argument, with, an, example, of, the, birth, of, an, intersexual, individual, and, maintains, our, conceptions, of, the, nature, of, gender, difference, shape, even, as, they, reflect, the, ways, we, structure, our, social, system, and, polity, they, also, shape, and, reflect, our, understanding, of, our, physical, bodies, then, she, adds, how, gender, assumptions, affects, the, scientific, study, of, sex, by, presenting, the, research, of, intersexuals, by, john, money, et, al, and, she, concludes, that, they, never, questioned, the, fundamental, assumption, that, there, are, only, two, sexes, because, their, goal, in, studying, intersexuals, was, to, find, out, more, about, normal, development, she, also, mentions, the, language, the, doctors, use, when, they, talk, with, the, parents, of, the, intersexuals, after, describing, how, the, doctors, inform, parents, about, the, intersexuality, she, asserts, that, because, the, doctors, believe, that, the, intersexuals, are, actually, male, or, female, they, tell, the, parents, of, the, intersexuals, that, it, will, take, a, little, bit, more, time, for, the, doctors, to, determine, whether, the, infant, is, a, boy, or, a, girl, that, is, to, say, the, doctors, behavior, is, formulated, by, the, cultural, gender, assumption, that, there, are, only, two, sexes, lastly, she, maintains, that, the, differences, in, the, ways, in, which, the, medical, professionals, in, different, regions, treat, intersexual, people, also, give, us, a, good, example, of, how, sex, is, socially, constructed, in, her, sexing, the, body, gender, politics, and, the, construction, of, sexuality, she, introduces, the, following, example, a, group, of, physicians, from, saudi, arabia, recently, reported, on, several, cases, of, xx, intersex, children, with, congenital, adrenal, hyperplasia, cah, a, genetically, inherited, malfunction, of, the, enzymes, that, aid, in, making, steroid, hormones, in, the, united, states, and, europe, such, children, because, they, have, the, potential, to, bear, children, later, in, life, are, usually, raised, as, girls, saudi, doctors, trained, in, this, european, tradition, recommended, such, a, course, of, action, to, the, saudi, parents, of, cah, xx, children, a, number, of, parents, however, refused, to, accept, the, recommendation, that, their, child, initially, identified, as, a, son, be, raised, instead, as, a, daughter, nor, would, they, accept, feminizing, surgery, for, their, child, this, was, essentially, an, expression, of, local, community, attitudes, with, the, preference, for, male, offspring, thus, it, is, evident, that, culture, can, play, a, part, in, assigning, gender, particularly, in, relation, to, intersex, children, many, of, the, more, complicated, human, behaviors, are, influenced, by, both, innate, factors, and, by, environmental, ones, which, include, everything, from, genes, gene, expression, and, body, chemistry, through, diet, and, social, pressures, a, large, area, of, research, in, behavioral, psychology, collates, evidence, in, an, effort, to, discover, correlations, between, behavior, and, various, possible, antecedents, such, as, genetics, gene, regulation, access, to, food, and, vitamins, culture, gender, hormones, physical, and, social, development, and, physical, and, social, environments, a, core, research, area, within, sociology, is, the, way, human, behavior, operates, on, itself, in, other, words, how, the, behavior, of, one, group, or, individual, influences, the, behavior, of, other, groups, or, individuals, starting, in, the, late, 20th, century, the, feminist, movement, has, contributed, extensive, study, of, gender, and, theories, about, it, notably, within, sociology, but, not, restricted, to, it, social, theorists, have, sought, to, determine, the, specific, nature, of, gender, in, relation, to, biological, sex, and, sexuality, with, the, result, being, that, culturally, established, gender, and, sex, have, become, interchangeable, identifications, that, signify, the, allocation, of, a, specific, biological, sex, within, a, categorical, gender, the, second, wave, feminist, view, that, gender, is, socially, constructed, and, hegemonic, in, all, societies, remains, current, in, some, literary, theoretical, circles, kira, hall, and, mary, bucholtz, publishing, new, perspectives, as, recently, as, 2008, as, the, child, grows, society, provides, a, string, of, prescriptions, templates, or, models, of, behaviors, appropriate, to, the, one, sex, or, the, other, which, socialises, the, child, into, belonging, to, a, culturally, specific, gender, there, is, huge, incentive, for, a, child, to, concede, to, their, socialisation, with, gender, shaping, the, individual, s, opportunities, for, education, work, family, sexuality, reproduction, authority, and, to, make, an, impact, on, the, production, of, culture, and, knowledge, adults, who, do, not, perform, these, ascribed, roles, are, perceived, from, this, perspective, as, deviant, and, improperly, socialized, some, believe, society, is, constructed, in, a, way, that, splits, gender, into, a, dichotomy, via, social, organisations, that, constantly, invent, and, reproduce, cultural, images, of, gender, joan, acker, believed, gendering, occurs, in, at, least, five, different, interacting, social, processes, looking, at, gender, through, a, foucauldian, lens, gender, is, transfigured, into, a, vehicle, for, the, social, division, of, power, gender, difference, is, merely, a, construct, of, society, used, to, enforce, the, distinctions, made, between, what, is, assumed, to, be, female, and, male, and, allow, for, the, domination, of, masculinity, over, femininity, through, the, attribution, of, specific, gender, related, characteristics, the, idea, that, men, and, women, are, more, different, from, one, another, than, either, is, from, anything, else, must, come, from, something, other, than, nature, far, from, being, an, expression, of, natural, differences, exclusive, gender, identity, is, the, suppression, of, natural, similarities, gender, conventions, play, a, large, role, in, attributing, masculine, and, feminine, characteristics, to, a, fundamental, biological, sex, socio, cultural, codes, and, conventions, the, rules, by, which, society, functions, and, which, are, both, a, creation, of, society, as, well, as, a, constituting, element, of, it, determine, the, allocation, of, these, specific, traits, to, the, sexes, these, traits, provide, the, foundations, for, the, creation, of, hegemonic, gender, difference, it, follows, then, that, gender, can, be, assumed, as, the, acquisition, and, internalisation, of, social, norms, individuals, are, therefore, socialized, through, their, receipt, of, society, s, expectations, of, acceptable, gender, attributes, that, are, flaunted, within, institutions, such, as, the, family, the, state, and, the, media, such, a, notion, of, gender, then, becomes, naturalized, into, a, person, s, sense, of, self, or, identity, effectively, imposing, a, gendered, social, category, upon, a, sexed, body, the, conception, that, people, are, gendered, rather, than, sexed, also, coincides, with, judith, butler, s, theories, of, gender, performativity, butler, argues, that, gender, is, not, an, expression, of, what, one, is, but, rather, something, that, one, does, it, follows, then, that, if, gender, is, acted, out, in, a, repetitive, manner, it, is, in, fact, re, creating, and, effectively, embedding, itself, within, the, social, consciousness, contemporary, sociological, reference, to, male, and, female, gender, roles, typically, uses, masculinities, and, femininities, in, the, plural, rather, than, singular, suggesting, diversity, both, within, cultures, as, well, as, across, them, the, difference, between, the, sociological, and, popular, definitions, of, gender, involve, a, different, dichotomy, and, focus, for, example, the, sociological, approach, to, gender, social, roles, female, versus, male, focuses, on, the, difference, in, economic, power, position, between, a, male, ceo, disregarding, the, fact, that, he, is, heterosexual, or, homosexual, to, female, workers, in, his, employ, disregarding, whether, they, are, straight, or, gay, however, the, popular, sexual, self, conception, approach, self, conception, gay, versus, straight, focuses, on, the, different, self, conceptions, and, social, conceptions, of, those, who, are, gay, straight, in, comparison, with, those, who, are, straight, disregarding, what, might, be, vastly, differing, economic, and, power, positions, between, female, and, male, groups, in, each, category, there, is, then, in, relation, to, definition, of, and, approaches, to, gender, a, tension, between, historic, feminist, sociology, and, contemporary, homosexual, sociology, according, to, alex, iantaffi, meg, john, barker, and, others, gender, is, biopsychosocial, this, is, because, it, is, derived, from, biological, psychological, and, social, factors, with, all, three, factors, feeding, back, into, each, other, to, form, a, person, s, gender, biological, factors, such, as, sex, chromosomes, hormones, and, anatomy, play, a, significant, role, in, the, development, of, gender, hormones, such, as, testosterone, and, estrogen, also, play, a, crucial, role, in, shaping, gender, identity, and, expression, anatomy, including, genitalia, and, reproductive, organs, can, also, influence, one, s, gender, identity, and, expression, psychological, factors, such, as, cognition, personality, and, self, concept, also, contribute, to, gender, development, gender, identity, emerges, around, the, age, of, two, to, three, years, gender, expression, which, refers, to, the, outward, manifestation, of, gender, is, influenced, by, cultural, norms, personal, preferences, and, individual, differences, in, personality, social, factors, such, as, culture, socialization, and, institutional, practices, shape, gender, identity, and, expression, in, some, english, literature, there, is, also, a, trichotomy, between, biological, sex, psychological, gender, and, social, gender, role, this, framework, first, appeared, in, a, feminist, paper, on, transsexualism, in, 1978, a, person, s, gender, can, have, legal, significance, in, some, countries, and, jurisdictions, there, are, same, sex, marriage, laws, the, legal, status, of, transgender, people, varies, greatly, around, the, world, some, countries, have, enacted, laws, protecting, the, rights, of, transgender, individuals, but, others, have, criminalized, their, gender, identity, or, expression, many, countries, now, legally, recognize, sex, reassignments, by, permitting, a, change, of, legal, gender, on, an, individual, s, birth, certificate, for, intersex, people, who, according, to, the, un, office, of, the, high, commissioner, for, human, rights, do, not, fit, typical, binary, notions, of, male, or, female, bodies, access, to, any, form, of, identification, document, with, a, gender, marker, may, be, an, issue, for, other, intersex, people, there, may, be, issues, in, securing, the, same, rights, as, other, individuals, assigned, male, or, female, other, intersex, people, may, seek, non, binary, gender, recognition, some, countries, now, legally, recognize, non, binary, or, third, genders, including, canada, germany, australia, new, zealand, india, and, pakistan, in, the, united, states, oregon, was, the, first, state, to, legally, recognize, non, binary, gender, in, 2017, and, was, followed, by, california, and, the, district, of, columbia, historically, science, has, been, portrayed, as, a, masculine, pursuit, in, which, women, have, faced, significant, barriers, to, participate, even, after, universities, began, admitting, women, in, the, 19th, century, women, were, still, largely, relegated, to, certain, scientific, fields, such, as, home, science, nursing, and, child, psychology, women, were, also, typically, given, tedious, low, paying, jobs, and, denied, opportunities, for, career, advancement, this, was, often, justified, by, the, stereotype, that, women, were, naturally, more, suited, to, jobs, that, required, concentration, patience, and, dexterity, rather, than, creativity, leadership, or, intellect, although, these, stereotypes, have, been, dispelled, in, modern, times, women, are, still, underrepresented, in, prestigious, hard, science, fields, such, as, physics, and, are, less, likely, to, hold, high, ranking, positions, a, situation, global, initiatives, such, as, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 5, are, trying, to, rectify, this, topic, includes, internal, and, external, religious, issues, such, as, gender, of, god, and, deities, creation, myths, about, human, gender, roles, and, rights, for, instance, leadership, roles, especially, ordination, of, women, sex, segregation, gender, equality, marriage, abortion, homosexuality, in, taoism, yin, and, yang, are, considered, feminine, and, masculine, respectively, the, taijitu, and, concept, of, the, zhou, period, reach, into, family, and, gender, relations, yin, is, female, and, yang, is, male, they, fit, together, as, two, parts, of, a, whole, the, male, principle, was, equated, with, the, sun, active, bright, and, shining, the, female, principle, corresponds, to, the, moon, passive, shaded, and, reflective, thus, male, toughness, was, balanced, by, female, gentleness, male, action, and, initiative, by, female, endurance, and, need, for, completion, and, male, leadership, by, female, supportiveness, in, judaism, god, is, traditionally, described, in, the, masculine, but, in, the, mystical, tradition, of, the, kabbalah, the, shekhinah, represents, the, feminine, aspect, of, god, s, essence, however, judaism, traditionally, holds, that, god, is, completely, non, corporeal, and, thus, neither, male, nor, female, conceptions, of, the, gender, of, god, notwithstanding, traditional, judaism, places, a, strong, emphasis, on, individuals, following, judaism, s, traditional, gender, roles, though, many, modern, denominations, of, judaism, strive, for, greater, egalitarianism, moreover, traditional, jewish, culture, recognizes, at, least, six, genders, in, christianity, god, is, traditionally, described, in, masculine, terms, and, the, church, has, historically, been, described, in, feminine, terms, on, the, other, hand, christian, theology, in, many, churches, distinguishes, between, the, masculine, images, used, of, god, father, king, god, the, son, and, the, reality, they, signify, which, transcends, gender, embodies, all, the, virtues, of, both, men, and, women, perfectly, which, may, be, seen, through, the, doctrine, of, imago, dei, in, the, new, testament, jesus, at, several, times, mentions, the, holy, spirit, with, the, masculine, pronoun, i, e, john, 15, 26, among, other, verses, hence, the, father, the, son, and, the, holy, spirit, i, e, trinity, are, all, mentioned, with, the, masculine, pronoun, though, the, exact, meaning, of, the, masculinity, of, the, christian, triune, god, is, contested, in, hinduism, one, of, the, several, forms, of, the, hindu, god, shiva, is, ardhanarishvara, literally, half, female, god, in, this, composite, form, the, left, half, of, the, body, represents, shakti, energy, power, in, the, form, of, the, goddess, parvati, otherwise, his, consort, while, the, right, half, represents, shiva, whereas, parvati, is, regarded, to, be, the, cause, of, arousal, of, kama, desire, shiva, is, the, destroyer, of, the, concept, symbolically, shiva, is, pervaded, by, the, power, of, parvati, and, parvati, is, pervaded, by, the, power, of, shiva, this, myth, projects, an, inherent, view, in, ancient, hinduism, that, each, human, carries, within, himself, both, female, and, male, components, which, are, forces, rather, than, sexes, and, it, is, the, harmony, between, the, creative, and, the, annihilative, the, strong, and, the, soft, the, proactive, and, the, passive, that, makes, a, true, person, evidence, of, homosexuality, bisexuality, androgyny, multiple, sex, partners, and, open, representation, of, sexual, pleasures, are, found, in, artworks, like, the, khajuraho, temples, believed, to, have, been, accepted, within, prevalent, social, frameworks, gender, inequality, is, most, common, in, women, dealing, with, poverty, many, women, must, shoulder, all, the, responsibility, of, the, household, because, they, must, take, care, of, the, family, oftentimes, this, may, include, tasks, such, as, tilling, land, grinding, grain, carrying, water, and, cooking, also, women, are, more, likely, to, earn, low, incomes, because, of, gender, discrimination, as, men, are, more, likely, to, receive, higher, pay, have, more, opportunities, and, have, overall, more, political, and, social, capital, then, women, approximately, 75, of, world, s, women, are, unable, to, obtain, bank, loans, because, they, have, unstable, jobs, it, shows, that, there, are, many, women, in, the, world, s, population, but, only, a, few, represent, world, s, wealth, in, many, countries, the, financial, sector, largely, neglects, women, even, though, they, play, an, important, role, in, the, economy, as, nena, stoiljkovic, pointed, out, in, d, c, development, and, cooperation, in, 1978, diana, m, pearce, coined, the, term, feminization, of, poverty, to, describe, the, problem, of, women, having, higher, rates, of, poverty, women, are, more, vulnerable, to, chronic, poverty, because, of, gender, inequalities, in, the, distribution, of, income, property, ownership, credit, and, control, over, earned, income, resource, allocation, is, typically, gender, biased, within, households, and, continue, on, a, higher, level, regarding, state, institutions, gender, and, development, gad, is, a, holistic, approach, to, give, aid, to, countries, where, gender, inequality, has, a, great, effect, of, not, improving, the, social, and, economic, development, it, is, a, program, focused, on, the, gender, development, of, women, to, empower, them, and, decrease, the, level, of, inequality, between, men, and, women, the, largest, discrimination, study, of, the, transgender, community, conducted, in, 2013, found, that, the, transgender, community, is, four, times, more, likely, to, live, in, extreme, poverty, income, of, less, than, 10, 000, a, year, than, people, who, are, cisgender, according, to, general, strain, theory, studies, suggest, that, gender, differences, between, individuals, can, lead, to, externalized, anger, that, may, result, in, violent, outbursts, these, violent, actions, related, to, gender, inequality, can, be, measured, by, comparing, violent, neighborhoods, to, non, violent, neighborhoods, by, noticing, the, independent, variables, neighborhood, violence, and, the, dependent, variable, individual, violence, it, is, possible, to, analyze, gender, roles, the, strain, in, the, general, strain, theory, is, the, removal, of, a, positive, stimulus, and, or, the, introduction, of, a, negative, stimulus, which, would, create, a, negative, effect, strain, within, individual, which, is, either, inner, directed, depression, guilt, or, outer, directed, anger, frustration, which, depends, on, whether, the, individual, blames, themselves, or, their, environment, studies, reveal, that, even, though, males, and, females, are, equally, likely, to, react, to, a, strain, with, anger, the, origin, of, the, anger, and, their, means, of, coping, with, it, can, vary, drastically, males, are, likely, to, put, the, blame, on, others, for, adversity, and, therefore, externalize, feelings, of, anger, females, typically, internalize, their, angers, and, tend, to, blame, themselves, instead, female, internalized, anger, is, accompanied, by, feelings, of, guilt, fear, anxiety, and, depression, women, view, anger, as, a, sign, that, they, ve, somehow, lost, control, and, thus, worry, that, this, anger, may, lead, them, to, harm, others, and, or, damage, relationships, on, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, men, are, less, concerned, with, damaging, relationships, and, more, focused, on, using, anger, as, a, means, of, affirming, their, masculinity, according, to, the, general, strain, theory, men, would, more, likely, engage, in, aggressive, behavior, directed, towards, others, due, to, externalized, anger, whereas, women, would, direct, their, anger, towards, themselves, rather, than, others, gender, and, particularly, the, role, of, women, is, widely, recognized, as, vitally, important, to, international, development, issues, this, often, means, a, focus, on, gender, equality, ensuring, participation, but, includes, an, understanding, of, the, different, roles, and, expectation, of, the, genders, within, the, community, gender, is, a, topic, of, increasing, concern, within, climate, change, policy, and, science, generally, gender, approaches, to, climate, change, address, gender, differentiated, consequences, of, climate, change, as, well, as, unequal, adaptation, capacities, and, gendered, contribution, to, climate, change, furthermore, the, intersection, of, climate, change, and, gender, raises, questions, regarding, the, complex, and, intersecting, power, relations, arising, from, it, these, differences, however, are, mostly, not, due, to, biological, or, physical, differences, but, are, formed, by, the, social, institutional, and, legal, context, subsequently, vulnerability, is, less, an, intrinsic, feature, of, women, and, girls, but, rather, a, product, of, their, marginalization, roehr, notes, that, while, the, united, nations, officially, committed, to, gender, mainstreaming, in, practice, gender, equality, is, not, reached, in, the, context, of, climate, change, policies, this, is, reflected, in, the, fact, that, discourses, of, and, negotiations, over, climate, change, are, mostly, dominated, by, men, some, feminist, scholars, hold, that, the, debate, on, climate, change, is, not, only, dominated, by, men, but, also, primarily, shaped, in, masculine, principles, which, limits, discussions, about, climate, change, to, a, perspective, that, focuses, on, technical, solutions, this, perception, of, climate, change, hides, subjectivity, and, power, relations, that, actually, condition, climate, change, policy, and, science, leading, to, a, phenomenon, that, tuana, terms, epistemic, injustice, similarly, macgregor, attests, that, by, framing, climate, change, as, an, issue, of, hard, natural, scientific, conduct, and, natural, security, it, is, kept, within, the, traditional, domains, of, hegemonic, masculinity, forbes, published, an, article, in, 2010, that, reported, 57, of, facebook, users, are, women, which, was, attributed, to, the, fact, that, women, are, more, active, on, social, media, on, average, women, have, 8, more, friends, and, account, for, 62, of, posts, that, are, shared, via, facebook, another, study, in, 2010, found, that, in, most, western, cultures, women, spend, more, time, sending, text, messages, compared, to, men, as, well, as, spending, more, time, on, social, networking, sites, as, a, way, to, communicate, with, friends, and, family, research, conducted, in, 2013, found, that, over, 57, of, pictures, posted, on, social, networking, sites, were, sexual, and, were, created, to, gain, attention, moreover, 58, of, women, and, 45, of, men, do, not, look, into, the, camera, which, creates, an, illusion, of, withdrawal, other, factors, to, be, considered, are, the, poses, in, pictures, such, as, women, lying, down, in, subordinate, positions, or, even, touching, themselves, in, childlike, ways, adolescent, girls, generally, use, social, networking, sites, as, a, tool, to, communicate, with, peers, and, reinforce, existing, relationships, boys, on, the, other, hand, tend, to, use, social, networking, sites, as, a, tool, to, meet, new, friends, and, acquaintances, furthermore, social, networking, sites, have, allowed, individuals, to, truly, express, themselves, as, they, are, able, to, create, an, identity, and, socialize, with, other, individuals, that, can, relate, social, networking, sites, have, also, given, individuals, access, to, create, a, space, where, they, feel, more, comfortable, about, their, sexuality, recent, research, has, indicated, that, social, media, is, becoming, a, stronger, part, of, younger, individuals, media, culture, as, more, intimate, stories, are, being, told, via, social, media, and, are, being, intertwined, with, gender, sexuality, and, relationships, research, has, found, that, almost, all, u, s, teens, 95, aged, 12, through, 17, are, online, compared, to, only, 78, of, adults, of, these, teens, 80, have, profiles, on, social, media, sites, as, compared, to, only, 64, of, the, online, population, aged, 30, and, older, according, to, a, study, conducted, by, the, kaiser, family, foundation, 11, to, 18, year, olds, spend, on, average, over, one, and, a, half, hours, a, day, using, a, computer, and, 27, minutes, per, day, visiting, social, network, sites, i, e, the, latter, accounts, for, about, one, fourth, of, their, daily, computer, use, studies, have, shown, that, female, users, tend, to, post, more, cute, pictures, while, male, participants, were, more, likely, to, post, pictures, of, themselves, in, activities, women, in, the, u, s, also, tend, to, post, more, pictures, of, friends, while, men, tend, to, post, more, about, sports, and, humorous, links, the, study, also, found, that, males, would, post, more, alcohol, and, sexual, references, the, roles, were, reversed, however, when, looking, at, a, teenage, dating, site, women, made, sexual, references, significantly, more, often, than, males, boys, share, more, personal, information, while, girls, are, more, conservative, about, the, personal, information, they, post, boys, meanwhile, are, more, likely, to, orient, towards, technology, sports, and, humor, in, the, information, they, post, to, their, profile, research, in, the, 1990s, suggested, that, different, genders, display, certain, traits, such, as, being, active, attractive, dependent, dominant, independent, sentimental, sexy, and, submissive, in, online, interaction, even, though, these, traits, continue, to, be, displayed, through, gender, stereotypes, recent, studies, show, that, this, is, not, necessarily, the, case, any,
