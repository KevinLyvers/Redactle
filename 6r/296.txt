a, scale, model, is, a, physical, model, that, is, geometrically, similar, to, an, object, known, as, the, prototype, scale, models, are, generally, smaller, than, large, prototypes, such, as, vehicles, buildings, or, people, but, may, be, larger, than, small, prototypes, such, as, anatomical, structures, or, subatomic, particles, models, built, to, the, same, scale, as, the, prototype, are, called, mockups, scale, models, are, used, as, tools, in, engineering, design, and, testing, promotion, and, sales, filmmaking, special, effects, military, strategy, and, hobbies, such, as, rail, transport, modeling, wargaming, and, racing, and, as, toys, model, building, is, also, pursued, as, a, hobby, for, the, sake, of, artisanship, scale, models, are, constructed, of, plastic, wood, or, metal, they, are, usually, painted, with, enamel, lacquer, or, acrylics, model, prototypes, include, all, types, of, vehicles, railroad, trains, cars, trucks, military, vehicles, aircraft, and, spacecraft, buildings, people, and, science, fiction, themes, spaceships, and, robots, models, are, built, to, scale, defined, as, the, ratio, of, any, linear, dimension, of, the, model, to, the, equivalent, dimension, on, the, full, size, subject, called, the, prototype, expressed, either, as, a, ratio, with, a, colon, ex, 1, 8, scale, or, as, a, fraction, with, a, slash, 1, 8, scale, this, designates, that, 1, inch, or, centimeter, on, the, model, represents, 8, such, units, on, the, prototype, in, english, speaking, countries, the, scale, is, sometimes, expressed, as, the, number, of, feet, on, the, prototype, corresponding, to, one, inch, on, the, model, e, g, 1, 48, scale, 1, inch, to, 4, feet, 1, 96, 1, inch, to, 8, feet, etc, models, are, obtained, by, three, different, means, kit, assembly, scratch, building, and, collecting, pre, assembled, models, scratch, building, is, the, only, option, available, to, structural, engineers, and, among, hobbyists, requires, the, highest, level, of, skill, craftsmanship, and, time, scratch, builders, tend, to, be, the, most, concerned, with, accuracy, and, detail, kit, assembly, is, done, either, out, of, the, box, or, with, modifications, known, as, kitbashing, many, kit, manufacturers, for, various, reasons, leave, something, to, be, desired, in, terms, of, accuracy, but, using, the, kit, parts, as, a, baseline, and, adding, after, market, conversion, kits, alternative, decal, sets, and, some, scratch, building, can, correct, this, without, the, master, craftsmanship, or, time, expenditure, required, by, scratch, building, scale, models, are, generally, of, two, types, static, and, animated, they, are, used, for, several, purposes, in, many, fields, including, most, hobbyist, s, models, are, built, for, static, display, but, some, have, operational, features, such, as, railroad, trains, that, roll, and, airplanes, and, rockets, that, fly, flying, airplane, models, may, be, simple, unpowered, gliders, or, have, sophisticated, features, such, as, radio, control, powered, by, miniature, methanol, nitromethane, engines, cars, in, 1, 24, 1, 32, or, ho, scale, are, fitted, with, externally, powered, electric, motors, which, run, on, plastic, road, track, fitted, with, metal, rails, on, slots, the, track, may, or, may, not, be, augmented, with, miniature, buildings, trees, and, people, children, can, build, and, race, their, own, gravity, powered, uncontrolled, cars, carved, out, of, a, wood, such, as, pine, with, plastic, wheels, on, metal, axles, which, run, on, inclined, tracks, the, most, famous, wood, racing, event, is, the, boy, scouts, of, america, s, annual, pinewood, derby, which, debuted, in, 1953, entry, is, open, to, cub, scouts, entrants, are, supplied, with, a, kit, containing, a, wooden, block, out, of, which, to, carve, the, body, four, plastic, wheels, and, four, axle, nails, or, they, may, purchase, their, own, commercially, available, kit, regulations, generally, limit, the, car, s, weight, to, 5, ounces, 141, 7, g, width, to, 2, 75, inches, 7, 0, cm, and, length, to, 7, inches, 17, 8, cm, the, rules, permit, the, cars, to, be, augmented, with, tungsten, carbide, weights, up, to, the, limit, and, graphite, axle, lubricant, miniature, wargames, are, played, using, miniature, soldiers, artillery, vehicles, and, scenery, built, by, the, players, before, the, advent, of, computer, generated, imagery, cgi, visual, effects, of, vehicles, such, as, marine, ships, and, spaceships, were, created, by, filming, miniature, models, these, were, considerably, larger, scale, than, hobby, versions, to, allow, inclusion, of, a, high, degree, of, surface, detail, and, electrical, features, such, as, interior, lighting, and, animation, for, star, trek, the, original, series, a, 33, inch, 0, 84, m, pre, production, model, of, the, starship, enterprise, was, created, in, december, 1964, mostly, of, pine, with, plexiglass, and, brass, details, at, a, cost, of, 600, this, was, followed, by, a, 135, 5, inch, 3, 44, m, production, model, constructed, from, plaster, sheet, metal, and, wood, at, ten, times, the, cost, of, the, first, as, the, enterprise, was, originally, reckoned, to, be, 947, feet, 289, m, long, this, put, the, models, at, 1, 344, and, 1, 83, 9, scale, respectively, the, polar, lights, company, sells, a, large, plastic, enterprise, model, kit, essentially, the, same, size, as, the, first, tv, model, in, 1, 350, scale, 32, inches, long, it, can, be, purchased, with, an, optional, electronic, lighting, and, animation, rotating, engine, domes, kit, although, structural, engineering, has, been, a, field, of, study, for, thousands, of, years, and, many, of, the, great, problems, have, been, solved, using, analytical, and, numerical, techniques, many, problems, are, still, too, complicated, to, understand, in, an, analytical, manner, or, the, current, numerical, techniques, lack, real, world, confirmation, when, this, is, the, case, for, example, a, complicated, reinforced, concrete, beam, column, slab, interaction, problem, scale, models, can, be, constructed, observing, the, requirements, of, similitude, to, study, the, problem, many, structural, labs, exist, to, test, these, structural, scale, models, such, as, the, newmark, civil, engineering, laboratory, at, the, university, of, illinois, uc, for, structural, engineering, scale, models, it, is, important, for, several, specific, quantities, to, be, scaled, according, to, the, theory, of, similitude, these, quantities, can, be, broadly, grouped, into, three, categories, loading, geometry, and, material, properties, a, good, reference, for, considering, scales, for, a, structural, scale, model, under, static, loading, conditions, in, the, elastic, regime, is, presented, in, table, 2, 2, of, the, book, structural, modeling, and, experimental, techniques, structural, engineering, scale, models, can, use, different, approaches, to, satisfy, the, similitude, requirements, of, scale, model, fabrication, and, testing, a, practical, introduction, to, scale, model, design, and, testing, is, discussed, in, the, paper, pseudodynamic, testing, of, scaled, models, aerodynamic, models, may, be, used, for, testing, new, aircraft, designs, in, a, wind, tunnel, or, in, free, flight, models, of, scale, large, enough, to, permit, piloting, may, be, used, for, testing, of, a, proposed, design, architecture, firms, usually, employ, model, makers, or, contract, model, making, firms, to, make, models, of, projects, to, sell, their, designs, to, builders, and, investors, these, models, are, traditionally, hand, made, but, advances, in, technology, have, turned, the, industry, into, a, very, high, tech, process, than, can, involve, class, iv, laser, cutters, five, axis, cnc, machines, as, well, as, rapid, prototyping, or, 3d, printing, typical, scales, are, 1, 12, 1, 24, 1, 48, 1, 50, 1, 100, 1, 200, 1, 500, etc, with, elements, similar, to, miniature, wargaming, building, models, and, architectural, models, a, plan, relief, is, a, means, of, geographical, representation, in, relief, as, a, scale, model, for, military, use, to, visualize, building, projects, on, fortifications, or, campaigns, involving, fortifications, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, navies, used, hand, made, models, of, warships, for, identification, and, instruction, in, a, variety, of, scales, that, of, 1, 500, was, called, teacher, scale, besides, models, made, in, 1, 1200, and, 1, 2400, scales, there, were, also, ones, made, to, 1, 2000, and, 1, 5000, some, made, in, britain, were, labelled, 1, inch, to, 110, feet, which, would, be, 1, 1320, scale, but, are, not, necessarily, accurate, many, research, workers, hydraulics, specialists, and, engineers, have, used, scale, models, for, over, a, century, in, particular, in, towing, tanks, manned, models, are, small, scale, models, that, can, carry, and, be, handled, by, at, least, one, person, on, an, open, expanse, of, water, they, must, behave, just, like, real, ships, giving, the, shiphandler, the, same, sensations, physical, conditions, such, as, wind, currents, waves, water, depths, channels, and, berths, must, be, reproduced, realistically, manned, models, are, used, for, research, e, g, ship, behaviour, engineering, e, g, port, layout, and, for, training, in, shiphandling, e, g, maritime, pilots, masters, and, officers, they, are, usually, at, 1, 25, scale, models, and, their, constituent, parts, can, be, built, out, of, a, variety, of, materials, such, as, this, includes, injection, molded, or, extruded, plastics, such, as, polystyrene, acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene, abs, butyrate, and, clear, acrylic, and, copolyester, petg, parts, can, also, be, cast, from, synthetic, resins, pine, wood, is, sometimes, used, balsa, wood, a, light, wood, is, good, for, flying, airplane, models, aluminum, or, brass, can, be, used, in, tubing, form, or, can, be, used, in, flat, sheets, with, photo, etched, surface, detail, model, figures, used, in, wargaming, can, be, made, of, white, metal, styrene, parts, are, welded, together, using, plastic, cement, which, comes, both, in, a, thick, form, to, be, carefully, applied, to, a, bonding, surface, or, in, a, thin, liquid, which, is, applied, into, a, joint, by, capillary, action, using, a, brush, or, syringe, needle, ethyl, cyanoacrylate, eca, aka, super, glue, or, fast, setting, epoxy, must, be, used, to, bond, styrene, to, other, materials, glossy, colors, are, generally, used, for, car, and, commercial, truck, exteriors, flat, colors, are, generally, desirable, for, military, vehicles, aircraft, and, spacecraft, metallic, colors, simulate, the, various, metals, silver, gold, aluminum, steel, copper, brass, etc, enamel, paint, has, classically, been, used, for, model, making, and, is, generally, considered, the, most, durable, paint, for, plastics, it, is, available, in, small, bottles, for, brushing, and, airbrushing, and, aerosol, spray, cans, disadvantages, include, toxicity, and, a, strong, chemical, smell, of, the, paint, and, its, mineral, spirit, thinner, brush, cleaner, modern, enamels, are, made, of, alkyd, resin, to, limit, toxicity, popular, brands, include, testor, s, in, the, us, and, humbrol, now, hornby, in, the, uk, lacquer, paint, produces, a, hard, durable, finish, and, requires, its, own, lacquer, thinner, enamels, have, been, generally, replaced, in, popularity, by, acrylic, paint, which, is, water, based, advantages, include, decreased, toxicity, and, chemical, smell, and, brushes, clean, with, soap, and, water, disadvantages, include, possibly, limited, durability, on, plastic, requiring, priming, coats, at, least, two, color, coats, and, allowing, adequate, cure, time, popular, brands, include, the, japanese, import, tamiya, some, beginner, s, level, kits, avoid, the, necessity, to, paint, the, model, by, adding, pigments, and, chrome, plating, to, the, plastic, decals, are, generally, applied, to, models, after, painting, and, assembly, to, add, details, such, as, lettering, flags, insignia, or, other, decorations, too, small, to, paint, water, transfer, slide, on, decals, are, generally, used, but, beginner, s, kits, may, use, dry, transfer, stickers, instead, model, railroading, us, and, canada, known, as, railway, modelling, in, uk, australia, new, zealand, and, ireland, is, done, in, a, variety, of, scales, from, 1, 4, to, 1, 450, t, scale, each, scale, has, its, own, strengths, and, weaknesses, and, fills, a, different, niche, in, the, hobby, gauge, gauge, model, railroads, originally, used, the, term, gauge, which, refers, to, the, distance, between, the, rails, just, as, full, size, railroads, continue, to, do, although, model, railroads, were, also, built, to, different, gauges, standard, gauge, in, full, size, railroads, is, 4, 8, 5, therefore, a, model, railroad, reduces, that, standard, to, scale, an, ho, scale, model, railroad, runs, on, track, that, is, 1, 87, of, 4, 8, 5, or, 0, 649, from, rail, to, rail, today, model, railroads, are, more, typically, referred, to, using, the, term, scale, instead, of, gauge, in, most, usages, confusion, arises, from, indiscriminate, use, of, scale, and, gauge, synonymously, the, word, scale, strictly, refers, to, the, proportional, size, of, the, model, while, gauge, strictly, applies, to, the, measurement, between, the, inside, faces, of, the, rails, it, is, completely, incorrect, to, refer, to, the, mainstream, scales, as, ho, gauge, n, gauge, z, gauge, etc, this, is, further, complicated, by, the, fact, some, scales, use, several, different, gauges, for, example, ho, scale, uses, 16, 5, mm, as, the, standard, gauge, of, 4, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, 1, 435, mm, 12, mm, to, represent, 1, 000, mm, 3, ft, 3, 3, 8, in, gauge, hom, and, 3, ft, 6, in, 1, 067, mm, hon3, 1, 2, and, 9, mm, to, represent, a, prototype, gauge, of, 2, ft, 610, mm, the, most, popular, scale, to, go, with, a, given, gauge, was, often, arrived, at, through, the, following, roundabout, process, german, artisans, would, take, strips, of, metal, of, standard, metric, size, to, construct, their, products, from, blueprints, dimensioned, in, inches, four, mm, to, the, foot, yielded, the, 1, 76, 2, size, of, the, british, oo, scale, which, is, anomalously, used, on, the, standard, ho, oo, scale, 16, 5, mm, gauge, from, 3, 5, mm, foot, scale, tracks, because, early, electric, motors, weren, t, available, commercially, in, smaller, sizes, today, most, scale, sizes, are, internationally, standardized, with, the, notable, exceptions, of, o, scale, and, n, scale, there, are, three, different, versions, of, the, o, scale, each, of, which, uses, tracks, of, 32, mm, for, the, standard, gauge, the, american, version, follows, a, dollhouse, scale, of, 1, 48, sometimes, called, quarter, gauge, as, in, one, quarter, inch, to, the, foot, the, british, version, continued, the, pattern, of, sub, contracting, to, germans, so, at, 7, mm, to, the, foot, it, works, out, to, a, scale, of, 1, 43, 5, later, the, european, authority, of, model, railroad, firms, morop, declared, that, the, o, gauge, still, 32, mm, must, use, the, scale, of, 1, 45, to, allow, wheel, tire, and, splasher, clearance, for, smaller, than, realistic, curved, sections, n, scale, trains, were, first, commercially, produced, at, 1, 160, scale, in, 1962, by, the, arnold, company, of, nuremberg, this, standard, size, was, imported, to, the, us, by, firms, such, as, the, aurora, plastics, corporation, however, the, early, n, scale, motors, would, not, fit, in, the, smaller, models, of, british, locomotives, so, the, british, n, gauge, was, standardized, to, allow, a, slightly, larger, body, size, similar, sizing, problems, with, japanese, prototypes, led, to, adoption, of, a, 1, 150, scale, standard, there, since, space, is, more, limited, in, japanese, houses, n, scale, has, become, more, popular, there, than, ho, scale, static, model, aircraft, are, commonly, built, using, plastic, but, wood, metal, card, and, paper, can, also, be, used, models, are, sold, painted, and, assembled, painted, but, not, assembled, snap, fit, or, unpainted, and, not, assembled, the, most, popular, types, of, aircraft, to, model, are, commercial, airliners, and, military, aircraft, popular, aircraft, scales, are, in, order, of, increasing, size, 1, 144, 1, 87, also, known, as, ho, or, half, o, scale, 1, 72, the, most, numerous, 1, 48, known, as, o, scale, 1, 32, 1, 24, 1, 16, 1, 6, and, 1, 4, some, european, models, are, available, at, more, metric, scales, such, as, 1, 50, the, highest, quality, models, are, made, from, injection, molded, plastic, or, cast, resin, models, made, from, vacuum, formed, plastic, are, generally, for, the, more, skilled, builder, more, inexpensive, models, are, made, from, heavy, paper, or, card, stock, ready, made, die, cast, metal, models, are, also, very, popular, as, well, as, the, traditional, scales, die, cast, models, are, available, in, 1, 200, 1, 250, 1, 350, 1, 400, 1, 500, and, 1, 600, scale, the, majority, of, aircraft, modelers, concern, themselves, with, depiction, of, real, life, aircraft, but, there, are, some, modelers, who, bend, history, by, modeling, aircraft, that, either, never, actually, flew, or, existed, or, by, painting, them, in, a, color, scheme, that, did, not, actually, exist, this, is, commonly, referred, to, as, what, if, or, alternative, modeling, and, the, most, common, theme, is, luftwaffe, 1946, or, luftwaffe, 46, this, theme, stems, from, the, idea, of, modeling, german, secret, projects, that, never, saw, the, light, of, day, due, to, the, close, of, world, war, ii, this, concept, has, been, extended, to, include, british, russian, and, us, experimental, projects, that, never, made, it, into, production, flying, model, aircraft, are, built, for, aerodynamic, research, and, for, recreation, aeromodeling, recreational, models, are, often, made, to, resemble, some, real, type, however, the, aerodynamic, requirements, of, a, small, model, are, different, from, those, of, a, full, size, craft, so, flying, models, are, seldom, fully, accurate, to, scale, flying, model, aircraft, are, one, of, three, types, free, flight, control, line, and, radio, controlled, some, flying, model, kits, take, many, hours, to, put, together, and, some, kits, are, almost, ready, to, fly, or, ready, to, fly, model, rocketry, dates, back, to, the, space, race, of, the, 1950s, the, first, model, rocket, engine, was, designed, in, 1954, by, orville, carlisle, a, licensed, pyrotechnics, expert, and, his, brother, robert, a, model, airplane, enthusiast, static, model, rocket, kits, began, as, a, development, of, model, aircraft, kits, yet, the, scale, of, 1, 72, never, caught, on, scales, 1, 48, and, 1, 96, are, most, frequently, used, there, are, some, rockets, of, scales, 1, 128, 1, 144, and, 1, 200, but, russian, firms, put, their, large, rockets, in, 1, 288, heller, sa, offers, some, models, in, the, scale, of, 1, 125, science, fiction, space, ships, are, heavily, popular, in, the, modeling, community, in, 1966, with, the, release, of, the, television, show, star, trek, the, original, series, amt, corporation, released, an, 18, inch, 46, cm, model, of, the, starship, enterprise, this, has, been, followed, over, the, decades, by, a, complete, array, of, various, starships, shuttlecraft, and, space, stations, from, the, star, trek, franchise, the, 1977, release, of, the, first, star, wars, film, and, the, 1978, tv, series, battlestar, galactica, also, spawned, lines, of, licensed, model, kits, in, scales, ranging, from, 1, 24, for, fighters, and, smaller, ships, to, 1, 1000, 1, 1400, and, 1, 2500, for, most, main, franchise, ships, and, up, to, 1, 10000, for, the, larger, star, wars, ships, for, especially, objects, like, the, death, stars, and, super, star, destroyers, even, smaller, scales, are, used, finemolds, in, japan, have, recently, released, a, series, of, high, quality, injection, molded, star, wars, kits, in, 1, 72, and, this, range, is, supplemented, by, resin, kits, from, fantastic, plastic, although, the, british, scale, for, 0, gauge, was, first, used, for, model, cars, made, of, rectilinear, and, circular, parts, it, was, the, origin, of, the, european, scale, for, cast, or, injection, molded, model, cars, morop, s, specification, of, 1, 45, scale, for, european, 0, does, not, alter, the, series, of, cars, in, 1, 43, scale, as, it, has, the, widest, distribution, in, the, world, in, america, a, series, of, cars, was, developed, from, at, first, cast, metal, and, later, styrene, models, promos, offered, at, new, car, dealerships, to, drum, up, interest, the, firm, monogram, and, later, tamiya, first, produced, them, in, a, scale, derived, from, the, architect, s, scale, 1, 24, scale, while, the, firms, amt, jo, han, and, revell, chose, the, scale, of, 1, 25, monogram, later, switched, to, this, scale, after, the, firm, was, purchased, by, revell, some, cars, are, also, made, in, 1, 32, scale, and, rolling, toys, are, often, made, on, the, scale, 1, 64, scale, chinese, die, cast, manufacturers, have, introduced, 1, 72, scale, into, their, range, the, smaller, scales, are, usually, die, cast, cars, and, not, the, in, the, class, as, model, cars, except, in, rare, occasions, johnny, lightning, and, ertl, made, die, cast, cars, were, sold, as, kits, for, buyers, to, assemble, model, cars, are, also, used, in, car, design, typically, found, in, 1, 50, scale, most, manufacturers, of, commercial, vehicles, and, heavy, equipment, commission, scale, models, made, of, die, cast, metal, as, promotional, items, to, give, to, prospective, customers, these, are, also, popular, children, s, toys, and, collectibles, the, major, manufacturers, of, these, items, are, conrad, and, nzg, in, germany, corgi, also, makes, some, 1, 50, models, as, well, as, dutch, maker, tekno, trucks, are, also, found, as, diecast, models, in, 1, 43, scale, and, injection, molded, kits, and, children, s, toys, in, 1, 24, scale, recently, some, manufacturers, have, appeared, in, 1, 64, scale, like, code, 3, a, model, construction, vehicle, or, engineering, vehicle, is, a, scale, model, or, die, cast, toy, that, represents, a, construction, vehicle, such, as, a, bulldozer, excavator, crane, concrete, pump, backhoe, etc, construction, vehicle, models, are, almost, always, made, in, 1, 50, scale, particularly, because, the, cranes, at, this, scale, are, often, three, to, four, feet, tall, when, extended, and, larger, scales, would, be, unsuited, for, display, on, a, desk, or, table, these, models, are, popular, as, children, s, toys, in, germany, in, the, us, they, are, commonly, sold, as, promotional, models, for, new, construction, equipment, commissioned, by, the, manufacturer, of, the, prototype, real, world, equipment, the, major, manufacturers, in, germany, are, conrad, and, nzg, with, some, competition, from, chinese, firms, that, have, been, entering, the, market, japanese, firms, have, marketed, toys, and, models, of, what, are, often, called, mecha, nimble, humanoid, fighting, robots, the, robots, which, appear, in, animated, shows, anime, are, often, depicted, at, a, size, between, 15, 20m, in, height, and, so, scales, of, 1, 100, and, 1, 144, are, common, for, these, subjects, though, other, scales, such, as, 1, 72, are, commonly, used, for, robots, and, related, subjects, of, different, size, the, most, prolific, manufacturer, of, mecha, models, is, bandai, whose, gundam, kit, lines, were, a, strong, influence, in, the, genre, in, the, 1980s, even, today, gundam, kits, are, the, most, numerous, in, the, mecha, modeling, genre, usually, with, dozens, of, new, releases, every, year, the, features, of, modern, gundam, kits, such, as, color, molding, and, snap, fit, construction, have, become, the, standard, expectations, for, other, mecha, model, kits, due, to, the, fantasy, nature, of, most, anime, robots, and, the, necessary, simplicity, of, cel, animated, designs, mecha, models, lend, themselves, well, to, stylized, work, improvisations, and, simple, scratchbuilds, one, of, gundam, s, contributions, to, the, genre, was, the, use, of, a, gritty, wartime, backstory, as, a, part, of, the, fantasy, and, so, it, is, almost, equally, fashionable, to, build, the, robots, in, a, weathered, beaten, style, as, would, often, be, expected, for, afv, kits, as, to, build, them, in, a, more, stylish, pristine, manner, scale, models, of, people, and, animals, are, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, venues, and, may, be, either, single, piece, objects, or, kits, that, must, be, assembled, usually, depending, on, the, purpose, of, the, model, for, instance, models, of, people, as, well, as, both, domestic, and, wild, animals, are, often, produced, for, display, in, model, cities, or, railroads, to, provide, a, measure, of, detail, or, realism, and, scaled, relative, to, the, trains, buildings, and, other, accessories, of, a, certain, line, of, models, if, a, line, of, trains, or, buildings, does, not, feature, models, of, living, creatures, those, who, build, the, models, often, buy, these, items, separately, from, another, line, so, they, can, feature, people, or, animals, in, other, cases, scale, model, lines, feature, living, creatures, exclusively, often, focusing, on, educational, interests, model, kits, of, superheroes, and, super, villains, from, popular, franchises, such, as, dc, entertainment, and, marvel, entertainment, are, also, sold, as, are, models, of, real, world, celebrities, such, as, marilyn, monroe, and, elvis, presley, one, type, of, assembly, kit, sold, as, educational, features, skeletons, and, anatomical, structure, of, humans, and, animals, such, kits, may, have, unique, features, such, as, glow, in, the, dark, pieces, dinosaurs, are, a, popular, subject, for, such, models, there, are, also, garage, kits, which, are, often, figures, of, anime, characters, in, multiple, parts, that, require, assembly, michele, morciano, says, small, scale, ship, models, were, produced, in, about, 1905, linked, to, the, wargaming, rules, and, other, publications, of, fred, t, jane, the, company, that, standardized, on, 1, 1200, was, bassett, lowke, in, 1908, the, british, admiralty, subsequently, contracted, with, bassett, lowke, and, other, companies, and, individual, craftsmen, to, produce, large, numbers, of, recognition, models, to, this, scale, in, 1914, 18, just, before, the, second, world, war, the, american, naval, historian, and, science, fiction, author, fletcher, pratt, published, a, book, on, naval, wargaming, as, could, be, done, by, civilians, using, ship, models, cut, off, at, the, waterline, to, be, moved, on, the, floors, of, basketball, courts, and, similar, locales, the, scale, he, used, was, non, standard, reported, as, 1, 666, and, may, have, been, influenced, by, toy, ships, then, available, but, as, the, hobby, progressed, and, other, rule, sets, came, into, use, it, was, progressively, supplemented, by, the, series, 1, 600, 1, 1200, and, 1, 2400, in, britain, 1, 3000, became, popular, and, these, models, also, have, come, into, use, in, the, usa, these, had, the, advantage, of, approximating, the, nautical, mile, as, 120, inches, 60, inches, and, 30, inches, respectively, as, the, knot, is, based, on, this, mile, and, a, 60, minute, hour, this, was, quite, handy, after, the, war, firms, emerged, to, produce, models, from, the, same, white, metal, used, to, make, toy, soldiers, lines, bros, ltd, a, british, firm, offered, a, tremendously, wide, range, of, waterline, merchant, and, naval, ships, as, well, as, dockyard, equipment, in, the, scale, 1, 1200, which, were, die, cast, in, zamak, in, the, us, at, least, one, manufacturer, of, the, wartime, 1, 1200, recognition, models, comet, made, them, available, for, the, civilian, market, postwar, which, also, drove, the, change, to, this, scale, in, addition, continental, european, manufacturers, and, european, ship, book, publishers, had, adopted, the, 1, 1250, drawing, scale, because, of, its, similar, convenience, in, size, for, both, models, and, comparison, drawings, in, books, a, prestige, scale, for, boats, comparable, to, that, of, 1, 32, for, fighter, planes, is, 1, 72, producing, huge, models, but, there, are, very, few, kits, marketed, in, this, scale, there, are, now, several, clubs, around, the, world, for, those, who, choose, to, scratch, build, radio, controlled, model, ships, and, submarines, in, 1, 72, which, is, often, done, because, of, the, compatibility, with, naval, aircraft, kits, for, the, smaller, ships, plank, on, frame, or, other, wood, construction, kits, are, offered, in, the, traditional, shipyard, scales, of, 1, 96, 1, 108, or, 1, 192, half, of, 1, 96, in, injection, molded, plastic, kits, airfix, makes, full, hull, models, in, the, scale, the, royal, navy, has, used, to, compare, the, relative, sizes, of, ships, 1, 600, revell, makes, some, kits, to, half, the, scale, of, the, us, army, standard, 1, 570, some, american, and, foreign, firms, have, made, models, in, a, proportion, from, the, engineer, s, scale, one, sixtieth, of, an, inch, to, the, foot, or, 1, 720, early, in, the, 20th, century, the, british, historian, and, science, fiction, author, h, g, wells, published, a, book, little, wars, on, how, to, play, at, battles, in, miniature, his, books, use, 2, lead, figures, particularly, those, manufactured, by, britains, his, fighting, system, employed, spring, loaded, model, guns, that, shot, matchsticks, this, use, of, physical, mechanisms, was, echoed, in, the, later, games, of, fred, jane, whose, rules, required, throwing, darts, at, ship, silhouettes, his, collection, of, data, on, the, world, s, fleets, was, later, published, and, became, renowned, dice, have, largely, replaced, this, toy, mayhem, for, consumers, for, over, a, century, toy, soldiers, were, made, of, white, metal, a, lead, based, alloy, often, in, architect, s, scale, based, ratios, in, the, english, speaking, countries, and, called, tin, soldiers, after, the, second, world, war, such, toys, were, on, the, market, for, children, but, now, made, of, a, safe, plastic, softer, than, styrene, american, children, called, these, army, men, many, sets, were, made, in, the, new, scale, of, 1, 40, a, few, styrene, model, kits, of, land, equipment, were, offered, in, this, and, in, 1, 48, and, 1, 32, scales, however, these, were, swept, away, by, the, number, of, kits, in, the, scale, of, 1, 35, those, who, continued, to, develop, miniature, wargaming, preferred, smaller, scale, models, the, soldiers, still, made, of, soft, plastic, airfix, particularly, wanted, people, to, buy, 1, 76, scale, soldiers, and, tanks, to, go, with, 00, gauge, train, equipment, roco, offered, 1, 87, scale, styrene, military, vehicles, to, go, with, ho, gauge, model, houses, however, although, there, is, no, 1, 72, scale, model, railroad, more, toy, soldiers, are, now, offered, in, this, scale, because, it, is, the, same, as, the, popular, aircraft, scale, the, number, of, fighting, vehicles, in, this, scale, is, also, increasing, although, the, number, of, auxiliary, vehicles, available, is, far, fewer, than, in, 1, 87, scale, a, more, recent, development, especially, in, wargaming, of, land, battles, is, 15, mm, white, metal, miniatures, often, referred, to, as, 1, 100, the, use, of, 15, mm, scale, metals, has, grown, quickly, since, the, early, 1990s, as, they, allow, a, more, affordable, option, over, 28, mm, if, large, battles, are, to, be, refought, or, a, large, number, of, vehicles, represented, the, rapid, rise, in, the, detail, and, quality, of, castings, at, 15, mm, scale, has, also, helped, to, fuel, their, uptake, by, the, wargaming, community, armies, use, smaller, scales, still, the, us, army, specifies, models, of, the, scale, 1, 285, for, its, sand, table, wargaming, there, are, metal, ground, vehicles, and, helicopters, in, this, scale, which, is, a, near, one, quarter, inch, to, six, feet, scale, the, continental, powers, of, nato, have, developed, the, similar, scale, of, 1, 300, even, though, metric, standardizers, really, don, t, like, any, divisors, other, than, factors, of, 10, 5, and, 2, so, maps, are, not, commonly, offered, in, europe, in, scales, with, a, 3, in, the, denominator, consumer, wargaming, has, since, expanded, into, fantasy, realms, employing, scales, large, enough, to, be, painted, in, imaginative, detail, so, called, heroic, 28, mm, figures, roughly, 1, 64, scale, firms, that, produce, these, make, small, production, lots, of, white, metal, alternatively, to, the, commercial, models, some, modelers, also, tend, to, use, scraps, to, achieve, home, made, warfare, models, while, it, doesn, t, always, involve, wargaming, some, modelers, insert, realistic, procedures, enabling, a, certain, realism, such, as, firing, guns, or, shell, deflection, on, small, scale, models, kits, for, building, an, engine, model, are, available, especially, for, kids, the, most, popular, are, the, internal, combustion, steam, jet, and, stirling, model, engine, usually, they, move, using, an, electric, motor, or, a, hand, crank, and, many, of, them, have, a, transparent, case, to, show, the, internal, process, in, action, most, hobbyists, who, build, models, of, buildings, do, so, as, part, of, a, diorama, to, enhance, their, other, models, such, as, a, model, railroad, or, model, war, machines, as, a, stand, alone, hobby, building, models, are, probably, most, popular, among, enthusiasts, of, construction, toys, such, as, erector, lego, and, k, nex, famous, landmarks, such, as, the, empire, state, building, big, ben, and, the, white, house, are, common, subjects, standard, scales, have, not, emerged, in, this, hobby, model, railroaders, use, railroad, scales, for, their, buildings, ho, scale, 1, 87, oo, scale, 1, 76, n, scale, 1, 160, and, o, scale, 1, 43, lego, builders, use, miniland, scale, 1, 20, minifig, scale, 1, 48, and, micro, scale, 1, 192, generally, the, larger, the, building, the, smaller, the, scale, model, buildings, are, commonly, made, from, plastic, foam, balsa, wood, or, paper, card, models, are, published, in, the, form, of, a, book, and, some, models, are, manufactured, like, 3, d, puzzles, professionally, building, models, are, used, by, architects, and, salesmen, typically, found, in, 1, 50, scale, and, also, called, model, house, model, home, or, display, house, this, type, of, model, is, usually, found, in, stately, homes, or, specially, designed, houses, sometimes, this, kind, of, model, is, commissioned, to, mark, a, special, date, like, an, anniversary, or, the, completion, of, the, architecture, or, these, models, might, be, used, by, salesmen, selling, homes, in, a, new, neighborhood, miniatures, and, model, kits, are, used, in, contemporary, art, whereby, artists, use, both, scratch, built, miniaturizations, or, commercially, manufactured, model, kits, to, construct, a, dialogue, between, object, and, viewer, the, role, of, the, artist, in, this, type, of, miniature, is, not, necessarily, to, re, create, an, historical, event, or, achieve, naturalist, realism, but, rather, to, use, scale, as, a, mode, of, articulation, in, generating, conceptual, or, theoretical, exploration, political, conceptual, and, architectural, examples, are, provided, by, noted, artists, such, as, bodys, isek, kingelez, jake, and, dinos, chapman, otherwise, known, as, the, chapman, brothers, ricky, swallow, shaun, wilson, sven, christoffersen, or,
