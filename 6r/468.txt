offered, more, variety, to, the, game, the, game, spread, to, other, schools, the, first, courts, built, at, harrow, were, dangerous, because, they, were, near, water, pipes, buttresses, chimneys,

middle, line, of, the, front, wall, is, the, service, line, the, dimensions, of, the, court, are, north, american, hardball, doubles, courts, are, larger, than, international, singles, courts, because, of, a, hard, ball, that, has, a, much, faster, pace, with, double, the, number, of, players, the, doubles, court, needs, to, be, significantly, bigger, than, a, singles, court, the, doubles, court, should, measure, 25, feet, wide, by, 45, feet, long, and, have, a, ceiling, height, of, at, least, 24, feet, but, preferably, 26, the, players, spin, a, racket, to, decide, who, serves, first, this, player, starts, the, first, rally, by, electing, to, serve, from, either, the, left, or, right, service, box, for, a, legal, serve, one, of, the, server, s, feet, must, be, in, the, service, box, not, touching, any, part, of, the, service, box, lines, as, the, player, strikes, the, ball, after, being, struck, by, the, racket, the, ball, must, strike, the, front, wall, above, the, service, line, and, below, the, out, line, and, land, in, the, opposite, back, quarter, court, the, receiving, player, can, choose, to, volley, a, serve, after, it, has, hit, the, front, wall, if, the, server, wins, the, point, the, two, players, switch, sides, for, the, following, point, if, the, server, loses, the, point, the, opponent, then, serves, and, can, serve, from, either, box, after, the, serve, the, players, take, turns, hitting, the, ball, against, the, front, wall, above, the, tin, and, below, the, out, line, the, ball, may, strike, the, side, or, back, walls, at, any, time, as, long, as, it, hits, below, the, out, line, it, must, not, hit, the, floor, after, hitting, the, racket, and, before, hitting, the, front, wall, a, ball, landing, on, either, the, out, line, or, the, line, along, the, top, of, the, tin, is, considered, to, be, out, after, the, ball, hits, the, front, wall, it, is, allowed, to, bounce, once, on, the, floor, and, any, number, of, times, against, the, side, or, back, walls, before, a, player, must, return, it, players, may, move, anywhere, around, the, court, but, accidental, or, deliberate, obstruction, of, the, other, player, s, movements, is, forbidden, and, could, result, in, a, let, or, a, stroke, players, typically, return, to, the, centre, of, the, court, after, making, a, shot, as, it, is, the, optimal, position, in, the, court, to, receive, the, opponent, s, shot, the, centre, of, the, court, is, typically, referred, to, as, the, t, named, after, the, shape, of, the, floor, lines, a, key, strategy, in, squash, is, known, as, dominating, the, t, the, intersection, of, the, red, lines, near, the, centre, of, the, court, shaped, like, the, letter, t, where, the, player, is, in, the, best, position, to, retrieve, the, opponent, s, next, shot, skilled, players, will, return, a, shot, and, then, move, back, toward, the, t, before, playing, the, next, shot, from, this, position, the, player, can, quickly, access, any, part, of, the, court, to, retrieve, the, opponent, s, next, shot, with, a, minimum, of, movement, and, possibly, maximising, the, movement, required, by, the, opponent, to, answer, the, returned, shot, a, common, tactic, is, to, hit, the, ball, straight, up, the, side, walls, to, the, back, corners, this, is, the, basic, squash, shot, referred, to, as, a, rail, straight, drive, wall, or, length, after, hitting, this, shot, the, player, will, then, move, to, the, centre, of, the, court, near, the, t, to, be, well, placed, to, retrieve, the, opponent, s, return, attacking, with, soft, or, short, shots, to, the, front, corners, referred, to, as, drop, shots, causes, the, opponent, to, cover, more, of, the, court, and, may, result, in, an, outright, winner, boasts, or, angle, shots, are, deliberately, struck, off, one, of, the, side, walls, before, the, ball, reaches, the, front, they, are, used, for, deception, and, again, to, cause, the, opponent, to, cover, more, of, the, court, rear, wall, shots, float, to, the, front, either, straight, or, diagonally, drawing, the, opponent, to, the, front, advantageous, tactical, shots, are, available, in, response, to, a, weak, return, by, the, opponent, if, stretched, the, majority, of, the, court, being, free, to, the, striker, nicks, are, when, the, ball, comes, into, contact, with, the, intersection, of, the, floor, and, any, sidewall, rallies, between, experienced, players, may, involve, 30, or, more, shots, and, therefore, a, very, high, premium, is, placed, on, fitness, both, aerobic, and, anaerobic, as, players, become, more, skilled, and, in, particular, better, able, to, retrieve, shots, points, often, become, a, war, of, attrition, at, higher, levels, of, the, game, the, fitter, player, has, a, major, advantage, the, ability, to, change, the, direction, of, the, ball, at, the, last, instant, is, also, a, tactic, used, to, unbalance, the, opponent, expert, players, can, anticipate, the, opponent, s, shot, a, few, tenths, of, a, second, before, the, average, player, giving, them, a, chance, to, react, sooner, depending, on, the, style, of, play, it, is, common, to, refer, to, squash, players, as, interference, and, obstruction, are, an, inevitable, aspect, of, squash, since, two, players, are, confined, within, a, shared, space, generally, the, rules, entitle, players, to, a, direct, straight, line, access, to, the, ball, room, for, a, reasonable, swing, and, an, unobstructed, shot, to, any, part, of, the, front, wall, when, interference, occurs, a, player, may, appeal, for, a, let, and, the, referee, or, the, players, themselves, if, there, is, no, official, then, interprets, the, extent, of, the, interference, the, referee, may, allow, a, let, and, the, players, then, replay, the, point, or, award, a, stroke, to, the, appealing, player, meaning, that, he, is, declared, the, winner, of, that, point, depending, on, the, degree, of, interference, whether, the, interfering, player, made, an, adequate, effort, to, avoid, interfering, and, whether, the, player, interfered, with, was, likely, to, have, hit, a, winning, shot, had, the, interference, not, occurred, an, exception, occurs, when, the, interfering, player, is, directly, in, the, path, of, the, other, player, s, swing, effectively, preventing, the, swing, in, which, case, a, stroke, is, always, awarded, when, it, is, deemed, that, there, has, been, little, or, no, interference, the, rules, provide, that, no, let, is, to, be, allowed, in, the, interests, of, continuity, of, play, and, the, discouraging, of, spurious, appeals, for, lets, because, of, the, subjectivity, in, interpreting, the, nature, and, magnitude, of, interference, awarding, or, withholding, of, lets, and, strokes, is, often, controversial, interference, also, occurs, when, a, player, s, shot, hits, their, opponent, prior, to, hitting, the, front, wall, if, the, ball, was, travelling, towards, the, side, wall, when, it, hit, the, opponent, or, if, it, had, already, hit, the, side, wall, and, was, travelling, directly, to, the, front, wall, it, is, usually, a, let, however, it, is, a, stroke, to, the, player, who, hit, the, ball, if, the, ball, was, travelling, straight, to, the, front, wall, when, the, ball, hit, the, opponent, without, having, first, hit, the, side, wall, generally, after, a, player, has, been, hit, by, the, ball, both, players, stand, still, if, the, struck, player, is, standing, directly, in, front, of, the, player, who, hit, the, ball, he, loses, the, stroke, if, he, is, not, straight, in, front, a, let, is, played, if, it, is, deemed, that, the, player, who, is, striking, the, ball, is, deliberately, trying, to, hit, his, opponent, they, will, lose, the, stroke, an, exception, occurs, when, the, player, hitting, the, ball, has, turned, i, e, letting, the, ball, pass, them, on, one, side, but, then, hitting, it, on, the, other, side, as, it, came, off, the, back, wall, in, these, cases, the, stroke, goes, to, the, player, who, was, hit, by, the, ball, the, referee, is, usually, a, certified, position, issued, by, the, club, or, assigned, squash, league, any, conflict, or, interference, is, dealt, with, by, the, referee, the, referee, may, also, take, away, points, or, games, due, to, improper, etiquette, regarding, conduct, or, rules, the, referee, is, also, usually, responsible, for, the, scoring, of, games, three, referees, are, usually, used, in, professional, tournaments, the, central, referee, has, responsibility, to, call, the, score, and, make, decisions, with, the, two, side, referees, games, are, played, according, to, point, a, rally, scoring, pars, to, 11, points, pars, is, almost, universally, preferred, by, the, game, s, top, professionals, and, is, the, current, official, scoring, system, for, all, levels, of, professional, squash, tournaments, in, pars, the, winner, of, a, rally, receives, a, point, regardless, of, whether, they, were, the, server, or, returner, games, are, played, to, 11, and, must, be, won, by, two, points, that, is, if, the, score, reaches, 10, 10, play, continues, until, one, player, wins, by, two, points, competition, matches, are, usually, played, to, best, of, five, games, i, e, the, first, player, to, win, three, games, squash, can, also, be, played, with, different, scoring, systems, such, as, pars, to, 15, traditional, english, or, hand, in, hand, out, hiho, scoring, to, 9, or, ram, scoring, see, below, players, often, experience, pars, and, hi, ho, as, requiring, different, tactics, and, player, attributes, point, a, rally, scoring, to, 15, was, used, for, the, world, championships, between, 1989, and, 2003, pars, to, 15, with, the, tiebreak, being, two, clear, points, as, per, standard, pars, from, 14, 14, was, used, in, many, amateur, leagues, because, pars, to, 11, was, considered, too, short, this, system, fell, out, of, favor, in, 2004, when, the, professional, squash, association, psa, decided, to, switch, to, pars, to, 11, games, were, considered, to, last, too, long, and, the, winner, would, usually, be, the, fitter, player, not, necessarily, the, better, player, known, as, english, or, hand, in, hand, out, scoring, under, this, system, if, the, server, wins, a, rally, they, receive, a, point, while, if, the, returner, wins, rally, only, the, service, changes, i, e, the, ball, goes, hand, out, and, no, point, is, given, the, first, player, to, reach, nine, points, wins, the, game, however, if, the, score, reaches, 8, 8, the, player, who, was, first, to, reach, eight, decides, whether, the, game, will, be, played, to, nine, as, before, called, set, one, or, to, 10, called, set, two, this, scoring, system, was, formerly, preferred, in, britain, and, also, among, countries, with, traditional, british, ties, such, as, australia, canada, pakistan, south, africa, india, and, sri, lanka, the, ram, scoring, system, is, a, proposed, new, scoring, system, created, by, former, world, champion, ramy, ashour, and, co, founded, by, osama, khalifa, this, consists, of, playing, a, best, of, five, games, each, game, is, three, minutes, long, however, this, only, refers, to, the, three, minutes, in, play, the, downtime, in, between, the, end, of, a, rally, and, a, serve, is, not, counted, once, the, time, is, up, the, clock, stops, and, the, leading, player, needs, to, win, a, final, point, if, the, player, who, is, behind, wins, the, point, the, game, continues, until, the, trailing, player, catches, up, and, wins, one, more, point, than, the, initially, leading, player, for, example, player, one, is, leading, 5, 3, and, the, clock, stops, player, two, wins, the, next, two, points, and, the, score, is, 5, 5, whoever, wins, the, next, point, wins, the, game, this, is, called, sudden, death, if, the, score, is, 0, 0, when, the, clock, stops, the, clock, is, reset, and, the, game, restarts, for, let, calls, the, clock, reverts, to, the, start, time, of, that, point, further, rules, include, that, there, must, be, a, referee, and, a, time, keeper, to, make, this, match, official, players, have, two, minutes, of, rest, between, games, and, all, other, standard, psa, and, wsf, rules, apply, in, 2004, the, professional, squash, association, psa, decided, to, switch, to, pars, 11, this, decision, was, ratified, in, 2009, when, the, world, squash, federation, confirmed, the, switch, to, the, pars, 11, scoring, system, since, that, time, almost, all, professional, and, league, games, have, been, played, according, to, pars, to, 11, one, of, the, reasons, for, switching, to, pars, was, that, long, taxing, matches, became, less, frequent, and, promoters, could, more, easily, predict, match, and, session, length, gawain, briars, who, served, as, the, executive, director, of, the, professional, squash, association, when, the, body, decided, to, switch, to, pars, in, 2004, hoped, that, pars, would, make, the, professional, game, more, exciting, to, watch, then, more, people, will, become, involved, in, the, game, and, our, chances, of, olympic, entry, may, be, enhanced, one, of, the, problems, with, english, or, hi, ho, scoring, is, that, games, often, last, longer, as, players, continually, win, service, before, losing, service, to, the, other, player, without, the, score, being, affected, consequently, the, winner, is, more, often, than, not, the, fitter, athlete, moreover, english, or, hi, ho, scoring, can, encourage, players, to, play, defensively, with, the, aim, of, wearing, down, one, s, opponent, before, winning, by, virtue, of, one, s, fitness, such, exhausting, defensive, play, can, affect, player, s, prospects, in, knock, out, tournaments, and, does, not, make, for, riveting, tv, in, english, or, hi, ho, one, player, might, win, by, 9, 0, despite, the, opponent, having, repeatedly, won, service, but, without, converting, that, service, into, actual, points, for, the, world, championships, hiho, to, 9, was, used, until, 1988, pars, to, 15, from, 1989, to, 2003, and, pars, to, 11, from, 2004, for, the, british, open, hiho, to, 9, was, used, until, 1994, pars, to, 15, from, 1995, to, 2003, and, pars, to, 11, from, 2004, the, wsf, s, decision, to, switch, to, pars, 11, proved, controversial, in, the, united, kingdom, and, commonwealth, where, games, were, usually, played, according, to, english, or, hi, ho, when, the, veterans, squash, rackets, club, of, great, britain, surveyed, their, members, in, 2012, they, found, that, 80, of, their, members, were, against, switching, from, hiho, to, pars, president, philip, ayton, argued, that, pars, would, kill, the, essence, of, the, game, ayton, was, particularly, concerned, that, the, great, comebacks, that, characterised, english, or, hi, ho, when, the, player, who, is, down, in, a, game, can, still, attack, when, in, hand, serving, would, disappear, as, pars, fostered, an, ultra, defensive, attitude, because, every, rally, counts, the, same, jahangir, khan, has, countered, that, pars, actually, made, the, game, far, more, attacking, but, diminished, the, psychological, aspect, of, the, game, with, the, nine, points, scoring, system, matches, were, more, mental, and, physical, and, could, go, longer, but, now, with, the, 11, point, system, every, rally, counts, and, even, if, you, go, behind, you, can, still, recover, that, makes, it, a, lot, more, attacking, maj, madan, one, of, the, game, s, top, referees, similarly, stated, that, pars, had, destroyed, the, fitness, element, and, more, importantly, the, cerebral, magic, of, the, game, his, comments, were, unearthed, when, an, email, chain, of, referees, discussing, the, problem, of, shorter, and, shorter, squash, matches, was, leaked, in, 2011, squash, provides, an, excellent, cardiovascular, workout, players, can, expend, approximately, 600, 1, 000, food, calories, 3, 000, 4, 000, kj, every, hour, playing, squash, according, to, english, or, hi, ho, scoring, the, sport, also, provides, a, good, upper, and, lower, body, workout, by, exercising, both, the, legs, in, running, around, the, court, and, the, arms, and, torso, in, swinging, the, racket, in, 2003, forbes, rated, squash, as, the, number, one, healthiest, sport, to, play, however, one, study, has, implicated, squash, as, a, cause, of, possible, fatal, cardiac, arrhythmia, and, argued, that, squash, is, an, inappropriate, form, of, exercise, for, older, men, with, heart, disease, as, of, november, 2019, there, were, players, from, eighteen, countries, in, the, top, fifty, of, the, men, s, world, rankings, with, egypt, dominating, with, fifteen, players, six, of, whom, were, in, the, top, ten, including, ranks, one, through,
