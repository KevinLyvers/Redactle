tofu, japanese, hepburn, t, fu, korean, rr, dubu, chinese, pinyin, d, ufu, is, a, food, prepared, by, coagulating, soy, milk, and, then, pressing, the, resulting, curds, into, solid, white, blocks, of, varying, softness, silken, soft, firm, extra, or, super, firm, tofu, is, also, known, as, bean, curd, in, english, it, is, a, traditional, component, of, east, asian, and, southeast, asian, cuisines, that, has, also, been, consumed, in, china, for, over, 2, 000, years, in, modern, western, cooking, it, is, often, used, as, a, meat, substitute, nutritionally, tofu, is, low, in, calories, while, containing, a, relatively, large, amount, of, protein, it, is, high, in, iron, and, can, have, a, high, calcium, or, magnesium, content, depending, on, the, coagulants, e, g, calcium, chloride, calcium, sulphate, magnesium, sulphate, used, in, manufacturing, the, english, word, tofu, comes, from, japanese, t, fu, the, japanese, tofu, in, turn, is, a, borrowing, of, chinese, mandarin, d, uf, tou4, fu, bean, curd, bean, ferment, the, earliest, documentation, of, the, word, in, english, is, in, the, 1704, translation, of, domingo, fern, ndez, navarrete, s, a, collection, of, voyages, and, travels, that, describes, how, tofu, was, made, the, word, towfu, also, appears, in, a, 1770, letter, from, the, english, merchant, james, flint, to, benjamin, franklin, 73, the, term, bean, curd, s, for, tofu, has, been, used, in, the, united, states, since, at, least, 1840, tofu, making, was, first, recorded, during, the, chinese, han, dynasty, about, 2000, years, ago, chinese, legend, ascribes, its, invention, to, prince, liu, an, 179, 122, bc, of, anhui, province, tofu, and, its, production, technique, were, introduced, to, japan, during, the, nara, period, 710, 794, some, scholars, believe, tofu, arrived, in, vietnam, during, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, 305, it, spread, to, other, parts, of, southeast, asia, as, well, this, probably, coincided, with, the, spread, of, buddhism, as, it, is, an, important, source, of, protein, in, the, vegetarian, diet, of, east, asian, buddhism, li, shizhen, during, the, ming, dynasty, described, a, method, of, making, tofu, in, the, compendium, of, materia, medica, since, then, tofu, has, become, a, staple, in, many, countries, including, vietnam, thailand, and, korea, with, regional, variations, in, production, methods, texture, flavor, and, usage, the, most, commonly, held, of, the, three, theories, of, tofu, s, origin, maintains, that, tofu, was, discovered, by, liu, an, 179, 122, bc, a, han, dynasty, prince, while, plausible, the, paucity, of, reliable, sources, for, this, period, makes, this, difficult, to, conclusively, determine, in, chinese, history, important, inventions, were, frequently, attributed, to, important, leaders, and, figures, of, the, time, in, 1960, a, stone, mural, unearthed, from, an, eastern, han, dynasty, tomb, provided, support, for, the, theory, of, the, han, origin, of, tofu, however, some, scholars, maintain, that, tofu, during, the, han, dynasty, was, rudimentary, and, lacked, the, firmness, and, taste, for, it, to, be, considered, as, tofu, another, theory, suggests, that, the, production, method, for, tofu, was, discovered, accidentally, when, a, slurry, of, boiled, ground, soybeans, was, mixed, with, impure, sea, salt, such, sea, salt, would, probably, have, contained, calcium, and, magnesium, salts, allowing, the, soy, mixture, to, curdle, and, produce, a, tofu, like, gel, the, last, group, of, theories, maintains, that, the, ancient, chinese, learned, the, method, for, curdling, soy, milk, by, emulating, the, milk, curdling, techniques, of, the, mongolians, the, primary, evidence, for, this, theory, is, the, etymological, similarity, between, the, chinese, term, r, f, which, literally, means, milk, curdled, used, during, sui, dynasty, ad, 581, 618, for, dishes, with, a, consistency, like, yogurt, or, soft, cheese, later, influenced, by, mongolian, milk, products, and, methods, of, production, and, the, term, d, ufu, beans, curdled, or, tofu, although, intriguing, and, possible, there, is, no, evidence, to, substantiate, this, theory, beyond, academic, speculation, a, form, of, tofu, may, have, been, discovered, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, ad, 220, but, it, did, not, become, a, popular, food, in, china, until, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, in, china, tofu, is, traditionally, used, as, a, food, offering, when, visiting, the, graves, of, deceased, relatives, it, is, claimed, that, the, spirits, or, ghosts, have, long, lost, their, chins, and, jaws, so, that, only, tofu, is, soft, enough, for, them, to, eat, before, refrigeration, was, available, in, china, tofu, was, often, only, sold, during, winter, since, tofu, did, not, spoil, as, easily, in, cold, weather, during, the, warmer, months, tofu, once, made, spoils, if, stored, for, more, than, a, day, tofu, was, introduced, to, japan, by, zen, buddhist, monks, who, initially, called, it, chinese, curd, t, fu, a, firm, variation, of, tofu, was, introduced, in, tosa, province, today, s, kochi, prefecture, by, a, korean, doctor, and, prisoner, of, war, following, the, japanese, invasions, of, korea, 1592, 1598, much, of, tofu, s, early, use, in, east, asia, was, as, a, vegetarian, substitute, for, meat, and, fish, by, buddhist, monks, especially, those, following, zen, buddhism, the, earliest, japanese, document, concerning, tofu, refers, to, the, dish, being, served, as, an, offering, at, the, kasuga, shrine, in, nara, in, 1183, the, book, tofu, hyakuchin, published, in, 1782, of, the, edo, period, lists, 100, recipes, for, cooking, tofu, in, southeast, asia, tofu, was, introduced, to, the, region, by, chinese, immigrants, from, fujian, province, as, evidenced, by, many, countries, in, southeast, asia, referring, to, tofu, using, the, min, nan, chinese, word, for, either, soft, or, firm, tofu, or, t, u, h, or, t, u, goa, n, respectively, in, indonesia, malaysia, singapore, thailand, cambodia, myanmar, the, philippines, and, vietnam, tofu, is, widely, available, and, used, in, many, local, dishes, tofu, is, called, tahu, in, indonesia, and, indonesian, dishes, such, as, tahu, sumbat, taugeh, tahu, asinan, siomay, and, some, curries, often, add, slices, of, tofu, tahu, goreng, tahu, isi, and, tahu, sumedang, are, popular, fried, tofu, snacks, tofu, is, called, tauhu, in, malaysia, and, singapore, malaysian, and, singaporean, indians, use, tofu, in, their, cuisine, such, as, in, indian, mee, goreng, and, rojak, pasembor, peranakan, cuisine, often, uses, tofu, as, in, penang, curry, noodles, and, laksa, indonesia, thailand, malaysia, and, the, philippines, are, major, producers, of, tofu, and, have, plants, in, many, municipalities, tofu, in, the, philippines, is, widely, eaten, as, the, breakfast, snack, tah, soft, tofu, from, philippine, hokkien, t, u, h, or, as, tokwa, dry, firm, tofu, that, is, usually, fried, from, philippine, hokkien, t, u, goa, n, which, is, a, staple, alternative, to, meat, in, main, meals, and, in, numerous, regional, dishes, tofu, was, introduced, to, the, archipelago, in, the, 10th, to, 13th, centuries, by, song, dynasty, chinese, mariners, and, merchants, along, with, many, other, foods, that, became, staples, of, the, philippine, diet, the, use, and, production, of, tofu, were, first, limited, to, urban, centers, with, influential, chinese, minorities, such, as, cebu, or, tondo, but, quickly, spread, to, even, remote, native, villages, and, islands, benjamin, franklin, was, the, first, american, to, mention, tofu, in, a, 1770, letter, to, john, bartram, 73, franklin, who, encountered, it, during, a, trip, to, london, included, a, few, soybeans, and, referred, to, it, as, cheese, from, china, in, 1770, franklin, also, corresponded, with, james, flint, on, the, subject, of, how, the, chinese, converted, callivances, soybeans, into, tofu, flint, s, writing, towfu, in, his, letter, is, the, earliest, documented, use, of, tofu, in, the, english, language, 73, the, first, tofu, company, in, the, united, states, was, established, in, 1878, in, 1908, li, yuying, a, chinese, anarchist, and, a, vegetarian, with, a, french, degree, in, agriculture, and, biology, opened, a, soy, factory, the, usine, de, la, cas, o, soja, ne, this, was, the, world, s, first, soy, dairy, and, the, first, factory, in, france, to, manufacture, and, sell, beancurd, however, tofu, was, not, well, known, to, most, westerners, before, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, when, it, was, popularized, in, the, united, states, by, william, shurtleff, and, akiko, aoyagi, the, book, of, tofu, 1975, regardless, of, the, product, or, scale, of, the, production, the, production, of, tofu, essentially, consists, of, it, is, similar, to, the, production, of, dairy, cheese, by, coagulating, the, milk, of, dairy, animals, to, form, curds, and, pressing, and, aging, the, curds, to, form, cheese, typical, tofu, making, procedures, are, cleaning, soaking, grinding, beans, in, water, filtering, boiling, coagulation, and, pressing, there, are, also, types, such, as, japanese, raw, silken, tofu, in, which, the, curds, are, not, pressed, coagulation, of, the, protein, and, oil, emulsion, suspended, in, boiled, soy, milk, is, the, most, important, step, in, the, production, of, tofu, this, process, is, accomplished, with, the, aid, of, coagulants, coagulation, depends, on, complex, interactions, there, are, many, variables, including, the, variety, and, percentage, of, protein, in, the, soybeans, used, slurry, cooking, temperature, coagulation, temperature, and, other, factors, soybean, proteins, are, mainly, composed, of, 7s, and, 11s, proteins, the, negative, surface, charges, on, these, globulins, usually, cause, them, to, repel, each, other, heating, soy, milk, denatures, the, proteins, and, exposes, hydrophobic, groups, normally, oriented, toward, the, inside, of, the, globulin, structure, cations, from, coagulants, bind, the, negatively, charged, groups, as, the, net, charges, of, the, protein, molecules, are, neutralized, attractive, hydrophobic, interactions, dominate, over, repulsive, electrostatic, charges, and, protein, aggregates, are, formed, two, types, of, coagulants, salts, and, acids, are, used, commercially, contemporary, tofu, manufacturers, may, choose, to, use, one, or, more, of, these, coagulants, since, each, plays, a, role, in, producing, the, desired, texture, in, the, finished, tofu, different, textures, result, from, different, pore, sizes, and, other, microscopic, features, in, the, tofu, produced, using, each, coagulant, the, coagulant, mixture, is, dissolved, in, water, and, the, solution, is, then, stirred, into, boiled, soy, milk, until, the, mixture, curdles, into, a, soft, gel, coagulants, are, typically, added, at, concentrations, between, 1, 5, and, 5, 0, g, kg, in, all, coagulants, consisting, of, calcium, or, magnesium, salts, the, positive, double, bonded, ions, of, the, calcium, or, magnesium, are, responsible, for, the, coagulation, of, the, soy, proteins, which, become, part, of, the, tofu, thereby, enhancing, its, nutritional, value, only, 1, part, per, 1000, of, the, tofu, eaten, is, coagulant, most, of, the, coagulant, reacts, with, soy, protein, and, is, broken, down, into, ions, the, non, reactive, portion, dissolves, in, the, whey, and, is, discarded, the, curds, are, processed, differently, depending, on, the, form, of, tofu, that, is, being, manufactured, for, soft, silken, tofu, n, nd, ufu, in, chinese, or, kinugoshi, d, fu, in, japanese, or, tofu, pudding, d, uhu, or, d, ufuhu, in, chinese, or, oboro, d, fu, in, japanese, the, soy, milk, is, curdled, directly, in, the, tofu, s, final, packaging, for, standard, firm, east, asian, tofu, the, soy, curd, is, cut, and, strained, of, excess, liquid, using, cheesecloth, or, muslin, and, then, lightly, pressed, to, produce, a, soft, cake, firmer, tofus, such, as, east, asian, dry, tofu, in, chinese, or, shimi, d, fu, in, japanese, or, western, types, of, tofu, are, further, pressed, to, remove, even, more, liquid, in, vietnam, the, curd, is, strained, and, molded, in, a, square, mold, and, the, end, product, is, called, u, khu, n, molded, bean, or, u, ph, one, of, the, vietnamese, ways, to, pronounce, the, chinese, d, ufu, the, tofu, curds, are, allowed, to, cool, and, become, firm, the, finished, tofu, can, then, be, cut, into, pieces, flavored, or, further, processed, although, tartness, is, sometimes, desired, in, dessert, tofu, the, acid, used, in, flavoring, is, usually, not, the, primary, coagulant, since, concentrations, sufficiently, high, to, induce, coagulation, negatively, affect, the, flavor, or, texture, of, the, resulting, tofu, a, sour, taste, in, tofu, and, a, slight, cloudiness, in, its, storing, liquid, is, also, usually, an, indication, of, bacterial, growth, and, hence, spoilage, the, whiteness, of, tofu, is, ultimately, determined, by, the, soybean, variety, soybean, protein, composition, and, degree, of, aggregation, of, the, tofu, gel, network, the, yellowish, beige, color, of, soybeans, is, due, to, the, color, compounds, including, anthocyanin, isoflavones, and, polyphenol, compounds, therefore, the, soybean, variety, used, will, predicate, the, color, of, the, final, tofu, product, ways, to, reduce, the, yellow, color, include, reducing, isoflavone, content, by, changing, the, ph, of, the, soy, milk, solution, used, in, the, production, of, the, tofu, so, that, the, relevant, compounds, precipitate, out, and, are, removed, during, the, extraction, of, okara, the, opacity, of, tofu, gel, and, the, off, white, color, typical, of, standard, uncooked, firm, tofu, is, due, to, the, scattering, of, light, by, the, colloidal, particles, of, the, tofu, the, addition, of, higher, levels, of, calcium, salts, or, a, high, protein, content, will, contribute, to, forming, a, denser, and, more, aggregated, gel, network, which, disperses, more, light, resulting, in, tofu, with, a, whiter, appearance, tofu, flavor, is, generally, described, as, bland, which, is, the, taste, desired, by, customers, in, north, america, a, more, beany, flavor, is, preferred, in, east, asia, the, beany, or, bland, taste, is, generated, during, the, grinding, and, cooking, process, and, either, a, hot, grind, or, a, cold, grind, can, be, used, to, influence, the, taste, the, hot, grind, method, reduces, the, beany, flavor, by, inactivating, the, lipoxygenase, enzyme, in, the, soy, protein, that, is, known, to, generate, off, flavors, eliminating, these, flavors, makes, tofu, that, is, bland, if, a, cold, grind, is, used, lipoxygenase, remains, and, produces, the, aldehyde, alcohol, and, ester, volatile, compounds, that, create, beany, notes, a, wide, variety, of, types, and, flavors, of, tofu, is, available, in, both, western, and, eastern, markets, despite, the, range, of, options, tofu, products, can, be, split, into, two, main, categories, fresh, tofu, which, is, produced, directly, from, soy, milk, and, processed, tofu, which, is, produced, from, fresh, tofu, tofu, production, also, creates, important, by, products, that, are, used, in, various, cuisines, unpressed, fresh, tofu, is, gelled, soy, milk, with, curd, that, has, not, been, cut, and, pressed, of, its, liquid, depending, on, whether, the, soy, milk, is, gelled, with, bittern, magnesium, chloride, solution, or, a, suspension, of, gypsum, calcium, sulphate, different, types, of, unpressed, tofu, are, produced, gypsum, gelled, soft, tofu, has, a, smooth, and, gel, like, texture, and, is, commonly, known, as, soft, tofu, silken, tofu, or, douhua, the, bittern, gelled, variety, has, a, very, soft, spongy, curdled, texture, and, is, known, as, extra, soft, or, sun, dubu, unpressed, tofu, is, so, soft, that, it, is, directly, ladled, out, for, serving, or, sold, with, its, gelling, container, unpressed, bittern, gelled, soft, tofu, is, called, sun, dubu, mild, tofu, in, korean, soy, milk, is, mixed, with, seawater, or, saline, water, made, with, sea, salt, so, that, it, curdles, the, curds, remain, loose, and, soft, freshly, made, sun, dubu, is, eaten, boiled, with, little, or, no, seasoning, manufactured, sundubu, is, usually, sold, in, tubes, it, is, also, the, main, ingredient, in, sundubu, jjigae, soft, tofu, stew, although, the, word, sun, in, sun, dubu, does, not, have, a, sino, korean, origin, sun, dubu, is, often, translated, into, chinese, and, japanese, using, the, chinese, character, whose, korean, pronunciation, is, sun, and, the, meaning, is, pure, thus, in, china, sun, dubu, is, called, ch, n, d, ufu, pure, tofu, and, in, japan, it, is, called, jun, t, fu, or, sundubu, soft, tofu, also, known, as, silken, tofu, is, called, n, nd, ufu, soft, tofu, or, hu, d, ufu, smooth, tofu, in, chinese, kinugoshi, d, fu, silk, filtered, tofu, in, japanese, and, yeon, dubu, korean, hanja, soft, tofu, in, korean, gelled, with, gypsum, this, tofu, is, undrained, and, unpressed, and, contains, a, high, moisture, content, silken, tofu, is, produced, by, coagulating, soy, milk, without, cutting, the, curd, silken, tofu, is, available, in, several, consistencies, including, soft, and, firm, but, all, silken, tofu, is, more, delicate, than, regular, firm, tofu, pressed, tofu, and, it, has, different, culinary, uses, silken, tofu, can, be, used, as, a, substitute, for, dairy, products, and, eggs, especially, for, smoothies, and, baked, desserts, douhua, also, known, as, d, ufuhu, in, chinese, or, tofu, brain, or, d, ufun, o, in, chinese, or, dau, fa, cantonese, and, tau, hua, fujianese, bean, flower, is, similar, to, silken, tofu, but, is, typically, served, a, few, hours, after, it, is, prepared, it, is, most, often, eaten, as, a, hot, dessert, but, sometimes, salty, pickles, or, hot, sauce, are, added, this, is, a, type, of, soft, tofu, with, very, high, moisture, content, because, using, chopsticks, make, douhua, difficult, to, pick, up, it, is, generally, eaten, with, a, spoon, with, the, addition, of, flavorings, such, as, finely, chopped, spring, onions, dried, shrimp, soy, sauce, or, chilli, sauce, douhua, is, a, popular, breakfast, dish, across, china, in, malaysia, douhua, is, usually, served, warm, with, white, or, dark, palm, sugar, syrup, or, served, cold, with, longans, it, is, frequently, served, at, breakfast, or, for, dessert, it, is, usually, served, either, with, a, sweet, ginger, syrup, or, a, mushroom, gravy, called, da, lu, it, s, normally, coagulated, at, the, restaurant, into, a, serving, container, douhua, is, not, always, considered, a, type, of, tofu, but, rather, a, type, of, food, in, its, own, right, some, variation, exists, among, soft, tofus, black, douhua, h, id, uhu, is, a, type, of, silken, tofu, made, from, black, soybeans, which, is, usually, made, into, d, uhu, rather, than, firm, or, dry, tofu, the, texture, of, black, bean, tofu, is, slightly, more, gelatinous, than, regular, douhua, and, the, color, is, greyish, in, tone, this, type, of, tofu, is, eaten, for, its, earthy, black, bean, taste, edamame, tofu, is, a, japanese, variety, of, kinugoshi, t, fu, made, from, edamame, fresh, green, soybeans, it, is, pale, green, in, color, and, often, studded, with, whole, edamame, depending, on, the, amount, of, water, that, is, extracted, from, the, cut, and, pressed, curds, two, types, of, tofu, are, produced, firm, and, extra, firm, fresh, tofu, is, usually, sold, completely, immersed, in, water, to, maintain, its, moisture, content, and, freshness, and, to, suppress, bacterial, growth, firm, tofu, called, l, od, ufu, in, chinese, momen, d, fu, in, japanese, cotton, tofu, mo, dubu, in, korean, although, drained, and, pressed, this, form, of, fresh, tofu, retains, a, high, moisture, content, it, has, the, firmness, of, raw, meat, and, bounces, back, readily, when, pressed, the, texture, of, the, inside, of, the, tofu, is, similar, to, that, of, a, firm, custard, the, skin, of, this, form, of, tofu, retains, the, pattern, of, the, muslin, used, to, drain, it, and, the, outside, is, slightly, more, resistant, to, damage, than, the, inside, it, can, be, picked, up, easily, with, chopsticks, a, very, firm, type, of, momen, d, fu, is, eaten, in, parts, of, japan, called, ishi, d, fu, stone, tofu, in, parts, of, ishikawa, or, iwa, d, fu, rock, tofu, in, gokayama, in, the, toyama, prefecture, and, in, iya, in, the, prefecture, of, tokushima, these, types, of, firm, tofu, are, produced, with, seawater, instead, of, nigari, magnesium, chloride, or, using, concentrated, soy, milk, some, of, them, are, squeezed, using, heavy, weights, to, eliminate, excess, moisture, these, products, are, produced, in, areas, where, traveling, is, inconvenient, such, as, remote, islands, mountain, villages, and, heavy, snowfall, areas, d, ug, n, literally, dry, tofu, in, chinese, or, su, ji, vegetarian, chicken, is, an, extra, firm, variety, of, tofu, where, a, large, proportion, of, the, liquid, has, been, pressed, out, d, ug, n, contains, the, least, moisture, of, all, fresh, tofu, the, firmness, of, fully, cooked, meat, and, a, somewhat, rubbery, feel, similar, to, that, of, paneer, when, sliced, thinly, this, tofu, can, be, crumbled, easily, the, skin, of, this, form, of, tofu,

than, 2, mm, 2, mm, shredded, dried, tofu, d, ug, ns, in, chinese, or, simply, g, ns, which, looks, like, loose, cooked, noodles, can, be, served, cold, stir, fried, or, added, to, soup, as, with, japanese, aburaage, many, forms, of, processed, tofu, exist, some, processing, techniques, probably, originate, before, the, days, of, refrigeration, from, the, need, to, preserve, tofu, or, to, increase, its, shelf, life, other, production, techniques, are, employed, to, create, tofus, with, different, textures, and, flavors, during, freezing, the, ice, crystals, puncture, cell, walls, and, facilitate, the, release, of, free, and, bound, water, and, cause, a, decrease, in, total, water, content, in, tofu, after, freezing, then, thawing, the, initial, protein, water, bonds, are, irreversibly, replaced, by, protein, protein, bonds, which, are, more, elastic, and, cause, a, structural, change, to, the, gel, network, and, lead, to, an, increase, in, textural, properties, such, as, hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and, gumminess, in, japan, two, kinds, of, freeze, dried, tofu, are, produced, those, are, usually, rehydrated, by, being, soaked, in, water, prior, to, consumption, in, their, dehydrated, state, they, do, not, require, refrigeration, tofu, skin, is, produced, when, soy, milk, is, boiled, in, an, open, shallow, pan, thus, producing, a, film, or, skin, composed, primarily, of, a, soy, protein, lipid, complex, on, the, liquid, surface, the, films, are, collected, and, dried, into, yellowish, sheets, known, as, soy, milk, skin, f, p, in, chinese, yuba, in, japanese, its, approximate, composition, is, 50, 55, protein, 24, 26, lipids, fat, 12, carbohydrate, 3, ash, and, 9, moisture, the, skin, can, also, be, dried, into, a, product, known, as, tofu, bamboo, f, zh, in, chinese, ph, tr, c, in, vietnamese, kusatake, japanese, or, into, many, other, shapes, since, tofu, skin, has, a, soft, yet, rubbery, texture, it, can, be, folded, or, shaped, into, different, forms, and, cooked, further, to, imitate, meat, in, vegan, cuisine, some, factories, dedicate, their, production, to, tofu, skin, and, other, soy, membrane, products, tofu, skin, is, commonly, sold, in, the, form, of, dried, leaves, or, sheets, other, people, would, put, the, tofu, bamboo, into, congee, a, watery, rice, mixture, that, is, eaten, for, breakfast, so, that, the, congee, becomes, more, silky, and, smooth, and, gives, a, whole, new, texture, also, soft, fragile, skin, would, be, on, the, congee, once, it, cools, down, tofu, skin, is, cooked, with, noodles, okara, from, the, japanese, is, known, as, xu, hu, c, i, in, chinese, lit, snowflake, vegetable, d, ufuzh, also, chinese, lit, tofu, sediment, residue, and, kongbiji, in, korean, sometimes, known, in,
