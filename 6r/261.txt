an, adult, is, a, human, or, other, animal, that, has, reached, full, growth, the, biological, definition, of, the, word, means, an, animal, reaching, sexual, maturity, and, thus, capable, of, reproduction, in, the, human, context, the, term, adult, has, meanings, associated, with, social, and, legal, concepts, in, contrast, to, a, non, adult, or, minor, a, legal, adult, is, a, person, who, has, attained, the, age, of, majority, and, is, therefore, regarded, as, independent, self, sufficient, and, responsible, they, may, also, be, regarded, as, majors, the, typical, age, of, attaining, legal, adulthood, is, 18, although, definition, may, vary, by, legal, rights, country, and, psychological, development, human, adulthood, encompasses, psychological, adult, development, definitions, of, adulthood, are, often, inconsistent, and, contradictory, a, person, may, be, biologically, an, adult, and, have, adult, behavior, but, still, be, treated, as, a, child, if, they, are, under, the, legal, age, of, majority, conversely, one, may, legally, be, an, adult, but, possess, none, of, the, maturity, and, responsibility, that, may, define, an, adult, character, in, different, cultures, there, are, events, that, relate, passing, from, being, a, child, to, becoming, an, adult, or, coming, of, age, this, often, encompasses, passing, a, series, of, tests, to, demonstrate, that, a, person, is, prepared, for, adulthood, or, reaching, a, specified, age, sometimes, in, conjunction, with, demonstrating, preparation, most, modern, societies, determine, legal, adulthood, based, on, reaching, a, legally, specified, age, without, requiring, a, demonstration, of, physical, maturity, or, preparation, for, adulthood, historically, and, cross, culturally, adulthood, has, been, determined, primarily, by, the, start, of, puberty, the, appearance, of, secondary, sex, characteristics, such, as, menstruation, and, the, development, of, breasts, in, women, ejaculation, the, development, of, facial, hair, and, a, deeper, voice, in, men, and, pubic, hair, in, both, sexes, in, the, past, a, person, usually, moved, from, the, status, of, child, directly, to, the, status, of, adult, often, with, this, shift, being, marked, by, some, type, of, coming, of, age, test, or, ceremony, during, the, industrial, revolution, children, went, to, work, as, soon, as, they, could, in, order, to, help, provide, for, their, family, there, was, not, a, huge, emphasis, on, school, or, education, in, general, many, children, could, get, a, job, and, were, not, required, to, have, experience, as, adults, are, nowadays, adulthood, in, more, recent, years, as, it, has, been, studied, has, developed, a, characteristic, list, that, goes, far, beyond, just, ones, physical, maturity, these, markers, for, a, full, mentally, developed, adult, include, traits, of, personal, responsibilities, in, multiple, aspects, of, life, although, few, or, no, established, dictionaries, provide, a, definition, for, the, two, word, term, biological, adult, the, first, definition, of, adult, in, multiple, dictionaries, includes, the, stage, of, the, life, cycle, of, an, animal, after, reproductive, capacity, has, been, attained, thus, the, base, definition, of, the, word, adult, is, the, period, beginning, at, physical, sexual, maturity, which, occurs, sometime, after, the, onset, of, puberty, although, this, is, the, primary, definition, of, the, base, word, adult, the, term, is, also, frequently, used, to, refer, to, social, adults, the, two, word, term, biological, adult, stresses, or, clarifies, that, the, original, definition, based, on, physical, maturity, i, e, having, reached, reproductive, competency, is, being, used, the, time, of, puberty, varies, from, child, to, child, but, usually, begins, between, 10, and, 12, years, old, girls, typically, begin, the, process, of, puberty, at, age, 10, or, 11, and, boys, at, age, 11, or, 12, girls, generally, complete, puberty, by, 15, 17, and, boys, by, age, 16, or, 17, nutrition, genetics, and, environment, also, usually, play, a, part, in, the, onset, of, puberty, girls, will, go, through, a, growth, spurt, and, gain, weight, in, several, areas, of, their, body, boys, will, go, through, similar, spurts, in, growth, though, it, is, usually, not, in, a, similar, style, or, time, frame, this, is, due, to, the, natural, processes, of, puberty, but, genetics, also, plays, a, part, in, how, much, weight, they, gain, or, how, much, taller, they, get, one, recent, area, of, debate, within, the, science, of, brain, development, is, the, most, likely, chronological, age, for, full, mental, maturity, or, indeed, if, such, an, age, even, exists, common, claims, repeated, in, the, media, since, 2005, based, upon, interpretations, of, imaging, data, have, commonly, suggested, an, end, point, of, 25, referring, to, the, prefrontal, cortex, as, one, area, that, is, not, yet, fully, mature, at, the, age, of, 18, however, this, is, based, on, an, interpretation, of, a, brain, imaging, study, by, jay, giedd, dating, back, to, 2004, or, 2005, where, the, only, participants, were, aged, up, to, 21, years, and, giedd, assumed, this, maturing, process, would, be, done, by, the, age, of, 25, years, whereas, more, recent, studies, show, prefrontal, cortex, maturation, continuing, well, past, the, age, of, 30, years, marking, this, interpretation, as, incorrect, and, outdated, legally, adulthood, typically, means, that, one, has, reached, the, age, of, majority, when, parents, lose, parental, rights, and, responsibilities, regarding, the, person, concerned, depending, on, one, s, jurisdiction, the, age, of, majority, may, or, may, not, be, set, independently, of, and, should, not, be, confused, with, the, minimum, ages, applicable, to, other, activities, such, as, engaging, in, a, contract, marriage, voting, having, a, job, serving, in, the, military, buying, possessing, firearms, driving, traveling, abroad, involvement, with, alcoholic, beverages, smoking, sexual, activity, gambling, being, a, model, or, actor, in, pornography, running, for, president, etc, admission, of, a, young, person, to, a, place, may, be, restricted, because, of, danger, for, that, person, concern, that, the, place, may, lead, the, person, to, immoral, behavior, or, because, of, the, risk, that, the, young, person, causes, damage, for, example, at, an, exhibition, of, fragile, items, one, can, distinguish, the, legality, of, acts, of, a, young, person, or, of, enabling, a, young, person, to, carry, out, that, act, by, selling, renting, out, showing, permitting, entrance, allowing, participation, etc, there, may, be, distinction, between, commercially, and, socially, enabling, sometimes, there, is, the, requirement, of, supervision, by, a, legal, guardian, or, just, by, an, adult, sometimes, there, is, no, requirement, but, rather, a, recommendation, using, the, example, of, pornography, one, can, distinguish, between, with, regard, to, films, with, violence, etc, the, age, of, majority, ranges, internationally, from, ages, 15, to, 21, with, 18, being, the, most, common, age, nigeria, mali, democratic, republic, of, congo, and, cameroon, define, adulthood, at, age, 15, but, marriage, of, girls, at, an, earlier, age, is, common, in, most, of, the, world, the, legal, adult, age, is, 18, for, most, purposes, with, some, notable, exceptions, prior, to, the, 1970s, young, people, were, not, classed, as, adults, until, 21, in, most, western, nations, for, example, in, the, united, states, young, citizens, could, not, vote, in, many, elections, until, 21, until, july, 1971, when, the, 26th, amendment, passed, mandating, that, the, right, to, vote, cannot, be, abridged, for, anyone, 18, or, older, the, voting, age, was, lowered, in, response, to, the, fact, that, young, men, between, the, ages, of, 18, and, 21, were, drafted, into, the, army, to, fight, in, the, vietnam, war, hence, the, popular, slogan, old, enough, to, fight, old, enough, to, vote, young, people, under, 21, in, the, us, could, also, not, purchase, alcohol, purchase, handguns, sign, a, binding, contract, or, marry, without, permission, from, parents, after, the, voting, age, was, lowered, many, states, also, moved, to, lower, the, drinking, age, with, most, states, having, a, minimum, age, of, 18, or, 19, and, also, to, lower, the, age, of, legal, majority, adulthood, to, 18, however, there, are, legal, activities, where, 18, is, not, the, default, age, of, adulthood, there, are, still, some, exceptions, where, 21, or, even, higher, is, still, the, benchmark, for, certain, rights, or, responsibilities, to, name, a, couple, examples, for, most, states, in, the, us, a, person, is, not, allowed, to, rent, a, vehicle, unless, they, are, 25, in, the, us, the, gun, control, act, of, 1968, prohibits, those, under, 21, from, purchasing, a, handgun, from, a, federally, licensed, dealer, although, federal, law, makes, an, exception, for, individuals, between, the, ages, of, 18, and, 20, to, obtain, one, from, a, private, dealer, if, state, law, permits, as, of, july, 1984, the, national, minimum, drinking, age, act, mandated, that, all, states, raise, their, respective, drinking, ages, to, 21, to, create, a, uniform, standard, for, legally, purchasing, drinking, or, publicly, possessing, alcohol, with, exceptions, made, for, consumption, only, in, private, residences, under, parental, supervision, and, permission, this, was, done, in, response, to, reducing, the, number, of, drunk, driving, fatalities, prevalent, among, young, drivers, states, that, choose, not, to, comply, can, lose, up, to, 10, of, highway, funding, the, credit, card, act, of, 2009, imposed, tougher, safeguards, for, young, adults, between, the, ages, of, 18, and, 20, obtaining, a, credit, card, young, adults, under, the, age, of, 21, must, either, have, a, co, signer, 21, or, older, or, show, proof, usually, a, source, of, income, that, they, can, repay, their, credit, card, balance, unless, that, requirement, is, met, one, must, wait, until, 21, to, be, approved, for, a, credit, card, on, their, own, the, affordable, care, act, of, 2010, expands, the, age, that, young, adults, can, remain, on, their, parent, s, health, insurance, plan, up, to, age, 26, as, of, december, 2019, the, federal, government, raised, the, legal, age, to, purchase, tobacco, and, vaping, products, from, 18, to, 21, in, states, where, recreational, marijuana, is, legalized, the, default, age, is, also, 21, though, those, younger, may, be, able, to, obtain, medical, marijuana, prescriptions, or, cards, upon, seeing, a, physician, gambling, also, varies, from, 18, to, 21, depending, on, the, state, and, many, rental, car, companies, do, not, rent, cars, to, those, under, 21, and, have, surcharges, for, drivers, under, 25, although, this, is, not, codified, and, is, company, policy, in, quebec, canada, the, quebec, legislature, in, 2020, raised, the, age, one, could, purchase, recreational, marijuana, from, 18, to, 21, stepping, out, of, line, with, most, of, the, country, that, set, a, minimum, age, of, 19, except, alberta, which, is, 18, the, quebec, government, cited, the, risk, that, marijuana, poses, to, the, brain, development, of, people, under, 21, as, justification, for, the, age, raise, in, march, 2021, the, state, of, washington, in, a, 5, 4, decision, justices, in, the, supreme, court, of, the, state, of, washington, tossed, the, life, without, parole, sentences, of, a, 19, year, old, and, a, 20, year, old, convicted, in, separate, cases, of, first, degree, aggravated, murder, decades, ago, saying, as, with, juveniles, the, court, must, first, consider, the, age, of, those, under, 21, before, sentencing, them, to, die, behind, bars, this, comes, at, a, time, where, there, are, ongoing, debates, about, whether, those, between, 18, and, 20, should, be, exempted, from, the, death, penalty, in, germany, courts, largely, sentence, defendants, under, the, age, of, 21, according, to, juvenile, law, in, a, bid, to, help, them,

21, in, an, attempt, to, curb, teen, and, young, adult, use, to, get, to, a, smoke, free, uk, by, 2030, all, of, these, laws, made, over, the, years, reflect, the, growing, awareness, that, young, adults, while, not, children, are, still, in, a, transitional, stage, between, adolescence, and, full, adulthood, and, that, there, should, be, policy, adjustments, or, restrictions, where, necessary, especially, where, it, pertains, to, activities, that, carry, certain, degrees, of, risk, or, harm, to, themselves, or, others, at, the, same, time, however, even, though, the, generally, accepted, age, of, majority, is, 18, in, most, nations, there, are, rights, or, privileges, afforded, to, adolescents, who, have, not, yet, reached, legal, adulthood, in, the, united, states, youth, are, able, to, get, a, part, time, job, at, 14, provided, they, have, a, work, permit, at, 16, one, is, able, to, obtain, a, driver, s, permit, or, license, depending, on, state, laws, and, is, able, to, work,

minor, in, upbringing, education, care, or, employment, in, contrast, to, biological, perspectives, of, aging, and, adulthood, social, scientists, conceptualize, adulthood, as, socially, constructed, while, aging, is, an, established, biological, process, the, attainment, of, adulthood, is, social, in, its, criteria, in, contrast, to, other, perspectives, that, conceptualize, aging, and, the, attainment, of, adulthood, as, a, largely, universal, development, regardless, of, context, nation, generation, gender, race, or, social, class, social, scientists, regard, these, aspects, as, paramount, in, cultural, definitions, of, adulthood, further, evidence, of, adulthood, as, a, social, construction, is, illustrated, by, the, changing, criteria, of, adulthood, over, time, historically, adulthood, in, the, u, s, has, rested, on, completing, one, s, education, moving, away, from, the, family, of, origin, and, beginning, one, s, career, other, key, historical, criteria, include, entering, a, marriage, and, becoming, a, parent, these, criteria, are, social, and, subjective, they, are, organized, by, gender, race, ethnicity, and, social, class, among, other, key, identity, markers, as, a, result, particular, populations, feel, adult, earlier, in, the, life, course, than, do, others, contemporary, experiences, of, and, research, on, young, adults, today, substitute, more, seemingly, subjective, criteria, for, adulthood, which, resonate, more, soundly, with, young, adults, experiences, of, aging, the, criteria, are, marked, by, a, growing, importance, of, individualistic, criteria, and, the, irrelevance, of, the, demographic, markers, of, normative, conceptions, of, adulthood, in, particular, younger, cohorts, attainment, of, adulthood, centers, on, three, criteria, gaining, a, sense, of, responsibility, independent, decision, making, and, financial, independence, jeffrey, arnett, a, psychologist, and, professor, at, clark, university, in, massachusetts, studied, the, development, of, adults, and, argues, that, there, is, a, new, and, distinct, period, of, development, in, between, adolescence, and, adulthood, this, stage, which, he, calls, emerging, adulthood, occurs, between, the, ages, of, 18, and, 25, arnett, describes, these, individuals, as, able, to, take, some, responsibility, for, their, lives, but, still, not, completely, feeling, like, an, adult, arnett, articulates, five, distinct, features, that, are, unique, to, this, period, of, development, identity, exploration, feeling, in, between, instability, self, focus, and, having, possibilities, arnett, makes, it, clear, that, these, 5, aspects, of, emerging, adulthood, are, only, relevant, during, the, life, stage, of, emerging, adulthood, the, first, feature, identity, exploration, describes, emerging, adults, making, decisions, for, themselves, about, their, career, education, and, love, life, this, is, a, time, of, life, when, a, young, person, has, yet, to, finalize, these, decisions, but, are, pondering, them, making, them, feel, somewhere, in, between, adolescent, and, adult, this, leads, into, a, second, feature, of, this, phase, of, life, feeling, in, between, emerging, adults, feel, that, they, are, taking, on, responsibilities, but, do, not, feel, like, a, full, adult, quite, yet, next, the, instability, feature, notes, that, emerging, adults, often, move, around, after, their, high, school, years, whether, that, is, to, college, friends, houses, or, living, with, a, romantic, partner, as, well, as, moving, back, home, with, their, parents, guardians, for, a, time, this, moving, around, often, ends, once, the, individual, s, family, and, career, have, been, set, tagging, along, with, the, instability, feature, is, having, self, focus, emerging, adults, being, away, from, their, parental, and, societal, routines, are, now, able, to, do, what, they, want, when, they, want, and, where, they, want, before, they, are, put, back, into, a, routine, when, they, start, a, marriage, family, and, career, arnett, s, last, feature, of, emerging, adulthood, an, age, of, possibilities, characterizes, this, stage, as, one, where, optimism, reigns, these, individuals, believe, they, have, a, good, chance, of, turning, out, better, than, their, parents, did, according, to, jewish, tradition, adulthood, is, reached, at, age, 13, for, jewish, boys, and, 12, for, jewish, girls, in, accordance, with, the, bar, or, bat, mitzvah, they, are, expected, to, demonstrate, preparation, for, adulthood, by, learning, the, torah, and, other, jewish, practices, the, christian, bible, and, jewish, scripture, contain, no, age, requirement, for, adulthood, or, marrying, which, includes, engaging, in, sexual, activity, the, 1983, code, of, canon, law, states, a, man, before, he, has, completed, his, sixteenth, year, of, age, and, likewise, a, woman, before, she, has, completed, her, fourteenth, year, of, age, cannot, enter, a, valid, marriage, according, to, the, disappearance, of, childhood, by, neil, postman, the, christian, church, of, the, middle, ages, considered, the, age, of, accountability, when, a, person, could, be, tried, and, even, executed, as, an, adult, to, be, age, 7, while, certain, religions, have, their, guidelines, on, what, it, means, to, be, an, adult, generally, speaking, there, are, trends, that, occur, regarding, religiosity, as, individuals, transition, from, adolescence, to, adulthood, the, role, of, religion, in, one, s, life, can, impact, development, during, adolescence, the, national, library, of, medicine, ncbi, highlights, some, studies, that, show, rates, of, religiosity, declining, as, people, move, out, of, the, house, and, live, on, their, own, oftentimes, when, people, live, on, their, own, they, change, their, life, goals, and, religion, tends, to, be, less, important, as, they, discover, who, they, are, other, studies, from, the, ncbi, show, that, as, adults, get, married, and, have, children, they, settle, down, and, as, they, do, there, tends, to, be, an, increase, in, religiosity, everyone, s, level, of, religiosity, builds, at, a, different, pace, meaning, that, religion, relative, to, adult, development, varies, across, cultures, and, time
