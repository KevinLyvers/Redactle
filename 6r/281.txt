play, is, a, range, of, intrinsically, motivated, activities, done, for, recreational, pleasure, and, enjoyment, play, is, commonly, associated, with, children, and, juvenile, level, activities, but, may, be, engaged, in, at, any, life, stage, and, among, other, higher, functioning, animals, as, well, most, notably, mammals, and, birds, play, is, often, interpreted, as, frivolous, yet, the, player, can, be, intently, focused, on, their, objective, particularly, when, play, is, structured, and, goal, oriented, as, in, a, game, accordingly, play, can, range, from, relaxed, free, spirited, spontaneous, and, frivolous, to, planned, or, even, compulsive, play, is, not, just, a, pastime, activity, it, has, the, potential, to, serve, as, an, important, tool, in, numerous, aspects, of, daily, life, for, adolescents, adults, and, cognitively, advanced, non, human, species, such, as, primates, not, only, does, play, promote, and, aid, in, physical, development, such, as, hand, eye, coordination, but, it, also, aids, in, cognitive, development, and, social, skills, and, can, even, act, as, a, stepping, stone, into, the, world, of, integration, which, can, be, a, very, stressful, process, play, is, something, that, most, children, partake, in, but, the, way, play, is, executed, is, different, between, cultures, and, the, way, that, children, engage, with, play, varies, the, seminal, text, in, the, field, of, play, studies, is, the, book, homo, ludens, first, published, in, 1944, with, several, subsequent, editions, in, which, johan, huizinga, defines, play, as, follows, 13, summing, up, the, formal, characteristic, of, play, we, might, call, it, a, free, activity, standing, quite, consciously, outside, ordinary, life, as, being, not, serious, but, at, the, same, time, absorbing, the, player, intensely, and, utterly, it, is, an, activity, connected, with, no, material, interest, and, no, profit, can, be, gained, by, it, it, proceeds, within, its, own, proper, boundaries, of, time, and, space, according, to, fixed, rules, and, in, an, orderly, manner, it, promotes, the, formation, of, social, groupings, that, tend, to, surround, themselves, with, secrecy, and, to, stress, the, difference, from, the, common, world, by, disguise, or, other, means, this, definition, of, play, as, constituting, a, separate, and, independent, sphere, of, human, activity, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, magic, circle, notion, of, play, a, phrase, also, attributed, to, huizinga, many, other, definitions, exist, jean, piaget, stated, the, many, theories, of, play, expounded, in, the, past, are, clear, proof, that, the, phenomenon, is, difficult, to, understand, another, definition, of, play, from, the, twenty, first, century, comes, from, the, national, playing, fields, association, the, definition, reads, as, follows, play, is, freely, chosen, personally, directed, intrinsically, motivated, behaviour, that, actively, engages, the, child, this, definition, focuses, more, on, the, child, s, freedom, of, choice, and, personal, motivation, related, to, an, activity, play, can, take, the, form, of, improvisation, pretense, interaction, performance, mimicry, games, sports, and, thrill, seeking, including, extreme, or, dangerous, sports, like, sky, diving, high, speed, racing, etc, philosopher, roger, caillois, wrote, about, play, in, his, 1961, book, man, play, and, games, free, form, play, gives, children, the, freedom, to, decide, what, they, want, to, play, and, how, it, will, be, played, both, the, activity, and, the, rules, are, subject, to, change, in, this, form, and, children, can, make, any, changes, to, the, rules, or, objectives, of, the, play, at, any, time, some, countries, in, the, twenty, first, century, have, added, emphasis, of, free, play, into, their, values, for, children, in, early, childhood, for, example, taiwan, and, hungary, structured, play, has, clearly, defined, goals, and, rules, such, play, is, called, a, game, other, play, is, unstructured, or, open, ended, both, types, of, play, promote, adaptive, behaviors, and, mental, states, of, happiness, sports, with, defined, rules, take, place, within, designated, play, spaces, such, as, sports, fields, in, association, football, for, example, players, kick, a, ball, in, a, certain, direction, and, push, opponents, out, of, their, way, as, they, do, so, while, appropriate, within, the, sport, s, play, space, these, same, behaviors, might, be, inappropriate, or, even, illegal, outside, the, playing, field, other, designed, play, spaces, can, be, playgrounds, with, dedicated, equipment, and, structures, to, promote, active, and, social, play, some, play, spaces, go, even, farther, in, specialization, to, bring, the, play, indoors, and, charge, admission, as, seen, at, children, s, museums, science, centers, or, family, entertainment, centers, family, entertainment, centers, or, play, zones, are, typically, for, profit, businesses, that, facilitate, play, and, entertainment, while, children, s, museums, and, science, centers, are, typically, non, profit, organisations, for, educational, entertainment, the, california, based, national, institute, for, play, describes, seven, play, patterns, another, classification, system, uses, these, categories, some, forms, overlap, such, as, a, relay, race, cooperative, and, competitive, or, building, a, blanket, fort, construction, and, creative, separate, from, self, initiated, play, play, therapy, is, used, as, a, clinical, application, of, play, aimed, at, treating, children, who, suffer, from, trauma, emotional, issues, and, other, problems, in, young, children, play, is, associated, with, cognitive, development, and, socialization, play, that, promotes, learning, and, recreation, often, incorporates, toys, props, tools, or, other, playmates, play, can, consist, of, an, amusing, pretend, or, imaginary, activity, alone, or, with, another, some, forms, of, play, are, rehearsals, or, trials, for, later, life, events, such, as, play, fighting, pretend, social, encounters, such, as, parties, with, dolls, or, flirting, findings, in, neuroscience, suggest, that, play, promotes, flexibility, of, mind, including, adaptive, practices, such, as, discovering, multiple, ways, to, achieve, a, desired, result, or, creative, ways, to, improve, or, reorganize, a, given, situation, as, children, get, older, they, engage, in, board, games, video, games, and, computer, play, and, in, this, context, the, word, gameplay, is, used, to, describe, the, concept, and, theory, of, play, and, its, relationship, to, rules, and, game, design, in, their, book, rules, of, play, researchers, katie, salen, and, eric, zimmerman, outline, 18, schemas, for, games, using, them, to, define, play, interaction, and, design, formally, for, behaviorists, similarly, in, his, book, half, real, video, games, between, real, rules, and, fictional, worlds, game, researcher, and, theorist, jesper, juul, explores, the, relationship, between, real, rules, and, unreal, scenarios, in, play, such, as, winning, or, losing, a, game, in, the, real, world, when, played, together, with, real, world, friends, but, doing, so, by, slaying, a, dragon, in, the, fantasy, world, presented, in, the, shared, video, game, play, is, explicitly, recognized, in, article, 31, of, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, the, child, adopted, by, the, general, assembly, of, the, united, nations, november, 29, 1989, which, declares, american, historian, howard, chudacoff, studied, the, interplay, between, parental, control, of, toys, and, games, and, children, s, drive, for, freedom, to, play, in, the, colonial, era, toys, were, makeshift, and, children, taught, each, other, very, simple, games, with, little, adult, supervision, the, market, economy, of, the, 19th, century, enabled, the, modern, concept, of, childhood, as, a, distinct, happy, life, stage, factory, made, dolls, and, doll, houses, delighted, young, girls, organized, sports, filtered, down, from, adults, and, colleges, and, boys, learned, to, play, with, a, bat, a, ball, and, an, impromptu, playing, field, with, the, rise, of, motor, vehicle, traffic, in, the, 20th, century, teenagers, were, increasingly, organized, into, club, sports, supervised, and, coached, by, adults, with, swimming, taught, at, summer, camps, and, through, supervised, playgrounds, under, the, american, new, deal, s, works, progress, administration, thousands, of, local, playgrounds, and, ball, fields, opened, promoting, softball, especially, as, a, sport, for, all, ages, and, genders, by, the, 21st, century, chudacoff, notes, the, old, tension, between, parental, controls, and, a, child, s, individual, freedom, was, being, played, out, in, cyberspace, the, act, of, play, time, is, a, cross, cultural, phenomenon, that, is, universally, accepted, and, encouraged, by, most, communities, however, it, can, differ, in, the, ways, that, is, performed, some, cultures, such, as, euro, american, ones, encourage, play, time, in, order, to, stress, cognitive, benefits, and, the, importance, of, learning, how, to, care, for, one, s, self, other, cultures, such, as, people, of, african, american, or, asian, american, heritages, stress, more, group, oriented, learning, and, play, where, kids, can, learn, what, they, can, do, with, and, for, others, parent, interactions, at, playtime, also, differ, within, communities, parents, in, the, mayan, culture, interact, with, their, children, in, a, playful, mindset, while, parents, in, the, united, states, tend, to, set, aside, time, to, play, and, teach, their, children, through, games, and, activities, in, the, mayan, community, children, are, supported, in, their, playing, but, also, encouraged, to, play, while, watching, their, parents, do, household, work, in, order, to, become, familiar, with, how, to, follow, in, their, footsteps, all, around, the, world, children, use, natural, materials, like, stones, water, sand, leaves, fruits, sticks, and, a, variety, of, resources, to, play, in, addition, there, are, groups, that, have, access, to, crafts, industrialized, toys, electronics, and, video, games, in, australia, games, and, sports, are, part, of, play, there, play, can, be, considered, as, preparation, for, life, and, self, expression, like, in, many, other, countries, groups, of, children, in, efe, of, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, can, be, seen, making, food, from, dirt, or, pretending, to, shoot, bows, and, arrows, much, like, their, elders, these, activities, are, similar, to, other, forms, of, play, worldwide, for, instance, children, can, be, seen, comforting, their, toy, dolls, or, animals, anything, that, they, have, modeled, from, adults, in, their, communities, in, brazil, children, can, be, found, playing, with, balls, kites, marbles, pretend, houses, or, mud, kitchens, like, in, many, other, countries, in, smaller, communities, they, use, mud, balls, little, stones, or, cashews, to, replace, marbles, at, an, indigenous, community, of, sierra, nevada, de, santa, marta, in, colombia, children, s, play, is, highly, valued, and, encouraged, by, leaders, and, parents, they, interact, with, the, children, of, different, ages, and, explore, together, different, environments, to, let, the, children, express, themselves, as, part, of, the, group, some, children, in, the, sahara, use, clay, figures, as, their, forms, of, playful, toys, toys, in, general, are, a, representation, of, cultural, practices, they, usually, illustrate, characters, and, objects, of, a, community, play, time, can, be, a, way, for, children, to, learn, the, different, ways, of, their, culture, many, communities, use, play, to, emulate, work, the, way, in, which, children, mimic, work, through, their, play, can, differ, according, to, the, opportunities, they, have, access, to, but, it, is, something, that, tends, to, be, promoted, by, adults, sport, activities, are, one, of, the, most, universal, forms, of, play, different, continents, have, their, own, popular, dominant, sports, for, example, european, south, american, and, african, countries, enjoy, soccer, also, known, as, football, in, europe, while, north, american, countries, prefer, basketball, ice, hockey, baseball, or, american, football, in, asia, sports, such, as, table, tennis, and, badminton, are, played, professionally, however, soccer, and, basketball, are, played, amongst, common, folks, with, cricket, popular, in, south, asia, events, such, as, the, olympic, games, and, fifa, world, cup, showcase, countries, competing, with, each, other, and, are, broadcast, all, over, the, world, sports, can, be, played, as, a, leisure, activity, or, within, a, competition, according, to, sociologist, norbert, elias, it, is, an, important, part, of, civilization, process, victory, and, defeat, in, sports, can, influence, one, s, emotions, to, a, point, where, everything, else, seems, irrelevant, sport, fans, can, also, imagine, what, it, feels, like, to, play, for, their, preferred, team, the, feelings, people, experience, can, be, so, surreal, that, it, affects, their, emotions, and, behavior, youth, sport, can, provide, a, positive, outcome, for, youth, development, research, shows, adolescents, are, more, motivated, and, engaged, in, sports, than, any, other, activity, and, these, conditions, predict, a, richer, personal, and, interpersonal, development, anxiety, depression, and, obesity, can, stem, from, lack, of, activity, and, social, interaction, there, is, a, high, correlation, between, the, amount, of, time, that, youth, spend, playing, sports, and, physical, e, g, better, general, health, psychological, e, g, subjective, well, being, academic, e, g, school, grades, and, social, benefits, e, g, making, friends, electronics, are, a, form, of, playtime, but, researchers, have, found, that, most, electronic, play, leads, to, lack, of, motivation, no, social, interaction, and, can, lead, to, obesity, play, is, children, using, their, creativity, while, developing, their, imagination, dexterity, and, physical, cognitive, and, emotional, strength, dramatic, play, is, common, in, younger, children, for, youth, to, benefit, from, playtime, the, following, are, recommended, by, participating, regularly, in, a, variety, of, sports, children, can, develop, and, become, more, proficient, at, various, skills, such, as, jumping, kicking, running, throwing, etc, if, they, focus, on, skill, mastery, and, development, young, athletes, can, also, develop, regular, participation, in, sport, and, physical, activity, is, associated, with, a, lower, risk, of, diabetes, heart, disease, obesity, and, other, related, diseases, according, to, research, by, the, australian, early, childhood, mental, health, initiative, children, can, be, assisted, in, dealing, with, and, managing, stress, by, developing, their, sense, of, optimism, when, playing, sports, young, people, also, tend, to, be, more, nutrition, conscious, in, their, food, choices, when, they, participate, in, sport, girls, involved, in, sport, are, less, likely, to, experience, teenage, pregnancy, begin, smoking, or, develop, breast, cancer, young, athletes, have, shown, lower, levels, of, total, cholesterol, and, other, favorable, profiles, in, serum, lipid, parameters, associated, with, cardiovascular, disease, sport, provides, an, arena, for, young, people, to, be, physically, active, and, so, reduces, the, time, spent, in, sedentary, pursuits, such, as, watching, tv, and, playing, video, games, although, adults, who, engage, in, high, amounts, of, play, may, find, themselves, described, as, childish, or, young, at, heart, by, less, playful, adults, play, is, an, important, activity, regardless, of, age, creativity, and, happiness, can, result, from, adult, play, where, the, objective, can, be, more, than, fun, alone, as, in, adult, expression, of, the, arts, or, curiosity, driven, science, some, adult, hobbies, are, examples, of, such, creative, play, in, creative, professions, such, as, design, playfulness, can, dispel, more, serious, attitudes, such, as, shame, or, embarrassment, that, impede, brainstorming, or, artistic, experimentation, in, design, imaginative, play, and, role, play, may, allow, adults, to, practice, useful, habits, such, as, learned, optimism, which, is, helpful, in, managing, fear, or, terrors, play, also, offers, adults, the, opportunity, to, practice, concepts, that, may, not, have, been, explicitly, or, formally, taught, e, g, how, to, manage, misinformation, or, deceit, thus, even, though, play, is, just, one, of, many, tools, used, by, effective, adults, it, remains, a, necessary, one, there, has, been, extensive, research, on, the, benefits, of, play, among, children, youth, and, adolescence, overlooked, are, the, benefits, of, play, for, adults, more, specifically, adults, who, spend, a, lot, of, time, in, the, workplace, many, adults, in, north, america, are, in, the, workforce, and, spend, half, of, their, waking, hours, in, a, workplace, environment, with, little, to, no, time, for, play, play, in, this, context, refers, to, leisure, type, activities, with, colleagues, during, lunch, breaks, or, short, breaks, throughout, the, working, day, leisure, activities, might, include, physical, sport, activities, card, games, board, games, video, games, foosball, ping, pong, yoga, and, boot, camp, sessions, playing, games, may, promote, a, persistent, and, optimistic, motivational, style, and, positive, affect, positive, affect, enhances, people, s, experiences, enjoyment, and, sense, of, satisfaction, during, their, engagement, with, a, task, while, people, are, engaged, in, work, positive, affect, increases, the, satisfaction, they, feel, from, the, work, and, this, increases, their, creativity, and, improves, their, performance, on, problem, solving, tasks, as, well, as, other, tasks, the, development, of, a, persistent, motivational, style, charged, with, positive, affect, may, lead, to, lasting, work, success, work, and, play, are, mutually, supportive, employees, need, to, experience, the, sense, of, newness, flow, discovery, and, liveliness, that, play, provides, this, provides, the, employee, with, the, sense, that, they, are, integrated, within, the, organization, and, therefore, they, feel, and, perform, better, incorporating, play, at, work, results, in, more, productivity, creativity, and, innovation, higher, job, satisfaction, greater, workplace, morale, stronger, or, new, social, bonds, improved, job, performance, and, a, decrease, in, staff, turnover, absenteeism, and, stress, decreased, stress, leads, to, less, illness, which, results, in, lower, health, care, costs, play, at, work, may, help, employees, function, and, cope, when, under, stress, refresh, body, and, mind, encourage, teamwork, trigger, creativity, and, increase, energy, while, preventing, burnout, companies, that, encourage, play, at, work, whether, short, breaks, throughout, the, day, or, during, lunch, breaks, are, more, successful, because, this, leads, to, positive, emotion, among, employees, risk, taking, confidence, in, presenting, novel, ideas, and, embracing, unusual, and, fresh, perspectives, are, associated, with, play, at, work, play, can, increase, self, reported, job, satisfaction, and, well, being, employees, experiencing, positive, emotions, are, more, cooperative, more, social, and, perform, better, when, faced, with, complex, tasks, contests, team, building, exercises, fitness, programs, mental, health, breaks, and, other, social, activities, make, the, work, environment, fun, interactive, and, rewarding, playfighting, i, e, playful, fights, or, fictive, disputes, may, contribute, to, organizations, and, institutions, as, in, youth, care, settings, staff, tries, to, down, key, playfight, invitations, to, treatment, or, learning, but, playfighting, also, offers, youth, and, staff, identificatory, respite, from, the, institutional, regime, playfighting, is, a, recurrent, pattern, in, the, social, life, of, a, youth, care, institution, and, sits, at, the, core, of, what, inmates, and, staff, have, to, deal, with, older, adults, represent, one, of, the, fastest, growing, populations, around, the, world, the, united, nations, predicted, an, increase, of, those, aged, 60, and, above, from, 629, million, in, 2002, to, approximately, two, billion, in, 2050, but, increased, life, expectancy, does, not, necessarily, translate, to, a, better, quality, of, life, for, this, reason, research, has, begun, to, investigate, methods, to, maintain, and, or, improve, quality, of, life, among, older, adults, similar, to, the, data, surrounding, children, and, adults, play, and, activity, are, associated, with, improved, health, and, quality, of, life, among, seniors, additionally, play, and, activity, tend, to, affect, successful, aging, as, well, as, boost, well, being, throughout, the, lifespan, although, children, adults, and, seniors, all, tend, to, benefit, from, play, older, adults, often, perform, it, in, unique, ways, to, account, for, possible, issues, such, as, health, restrictions, limited, accessibility, and, revised, priorities, for, this, reason, elderly, people, may, partake, in, physical, exercise, groups, interactive, video, games, and, social, forums, specifically, geared, towards, their, needs, and, interests, one, qualitative, research, study, found, older, adults, often, chose, to, engage, in, specific, games, such, as, dominoes, checkers, and, bingo, for, entertainment, another, study, indicated, a, common, pattern, in, game, preferences, among, older, adults, seniors, often, favor, activities, that, encourage, mental, and, physical, fitness, incorporate, past, interests, have, some, level, of, competition, and, foster, a, sense, of, belonging, researchers, investigating, play, in, older, adults, are, also, interested, in, the, benefits, of, technology, and, video, games, as, therapeutic, tools, these, outlets, can, lower, the, risk, of, developing, particular, diseases, reduce, feelings, of, social, isolation, and, stress, and, promote, creativity, and, the, maintenance, of, cognitive, skills, as, a, result, play, has, been, integrated, into, physiotherapy, and, occupational, therapy, interventions, for, seniors, the, ability, to, incorporate, play, into, one, s, routine, is, important, because, these, activities, allow, participants, to, express, creativity, improve, verbal, and, non, verbal, intelligence, and, enhance, balance, these, benefits, may, be, especially, crucial, to, seniors, because, cognitive, and, physical, functioning, declines, with, age, however, it, might, not, be, aging, itself, that, is, associated, with, the, decline, in, cognitive, and, physical, capabilities, but, the, higher, levels, of, inactivity, in, older, adults, play, and, activity, tend, to, decline, with, age, which, may, result, in, negative, outcomes, such, as, social, isolation, depression, and, mobility, issues, american, studies, found, that, only, 24, of, seniors, took, part, in, regular, physical, activity, and, only, 42, use, the, internet, for, entertainment, purposes, in, comparison, to, other, age, groups, the, elderly, are, more, likely, to, experience, a, variety, of, barriers, such, as, difficulty, with, environmental, hazards, and, accessibility, issues, that, may, hinder, their, abilities, to, play, although, playing, may, benefit, seniors, it, also, has, the, potential, to, negatively, impact, their, health, for, example, those, who, play, may, be, more, susceptible, to, injury, investigating, these, barriers, may, assist, in, the, creation, of, useful, interventions, and, or, the, development, of, preventative, measures, such, as, establishing, safer, recreational, areas, that, promote, play, throughout, elderly, life, a, moderate, level, of, play, has, numerous, positive, outcomes, in, the, lives, of, senior, citizens, to, support, and, promote, play, within, the, older, population, institutions, should, set, up, more, diverse, equipment, improve, conditions, within, recreational, areas, and, create, more, video, games, or, online, forums, that, appeal, to, the, needs, of, seniors, evolutionary, psychologists, believe, that, there, must, be, an, important, benefit, of, play, as, there, are, so, many, other, reasons, to, avoid, it, observations, have, shown, it, has, arisen, independently, in, such, varied, groups, as, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and, invertebrates, animals, are, often, injured, during, play, become, distracted, from, predators, and, expend, valuable, energy, in, rare, cases, play, has, even, been, observed, between, different, species, that, are, natural, enemies, such, as, a, polar, bear, and, a, dog, yet, play, seems, to, be, a, normal, activity, with, animals, who, occupy, the, higher, strata, of, their, own, hierarchy, of, needs, animals, on, the, lower, strata, e, g, stressed, and, starving, animals, generally, do, not, play, however, in, wild, assamese, macaques, physically, active, play, is, performed, also, during, periods, of, low, food, availability, and, even, if, it, is, at, the, expense, of, growth, which, highlights, the, developmental, and, evolutionary, importance, of, play, the, social, cognitive, complexity, of, numerous, species, including, dogs, have, been, explored, in, experimental, studies, in, one, such, study, conducted, by, alexandra, horowitz, of, the, university, of, california, the, communication, and, attention, getting, skills, of, dogs, were, investigated, in, a, natural, setting, dyadic, play, behavior, was, observed, head, direction, and, posture, was, specifically, noted, when, one, of, the, two, dogs, was, facing, away, or, otherwise, preoccupied, attention, getting, behaviors, and, signals, nudging, barking, growling, pawing, jumping, etc, were, used, by, the, other, dog, to, communicate, the, intent, and, or, desire, to, continue, on, with, the, dyadic, play, stronger, or, more, frequent, signaling, was, used, if, the, attention, of, the, other, dog, was, not, captured, these, observations, tell, us, that, these, dogs, know, how, play, behavior, and, signaling, can, be, used, to, capture, attention, communicate, intent, and, desire, and, manipulate, one, another, this, characteristic, and, skill, called, the, attention, getting, skill, has, generally, only, been, seen, in, humans, but, is, now, being, researched, and, seen, in, many, different, species, observing, play, behavior, in, various, species, can, tell, much, about, the, player, s, environment, including, the, welfare, of, the, animal, personal, needs, social, rank, if, any, immediate, relationships, and, eligibility, for, mating, play, activity, often, observed, through, action, and, signals, serves, as, a, tool, for, communication, and, expression, through, mimicry, chasing, biting, and, touching, animals, act, out, in, ways, that, send, messages, to, one, another, whether, it, s, an, alert, initiation, of, play, or, expressing, intent, when, play, behavior, was, observed, for, a, study, in, tonkean, macaques, it, was, discovered, that, play, signals, weren, t, always, used, to, initiate, play, rather, these, signals, were, viewed, primarily, as, methods, of, communication, sharing, information, and, attention, getting, one, theory, play, as, preparation, was, inspired, by, the, observation, that, play, often, mimics, adult, themes, of, survival, predators, such, as, lions, and, bears, play, by, chasing, pouncing, pawing, wrestling, and, biting, as, they, learn, to, stalk, and, kill, prey, prey, animals, such, as, deer, and, zebras, play, by, running, and, leaping, as, they, acquire, speed, and, agility, hoofed, mammals, also, practice, kicking, their, hind, legs, to, learn, to, ward, off, attacks, indeed, time, spent, in, physical, play, accelerates, motor, skill, acquisition, in, wild, assamese, macaques, while, mimicking, adult, behavior, attacking, actions, such, as, kicking, and, biting, are, not, completely, fulfilled, so, playmates, do, not, generally, injure, each, other, in, social, animals, playing, might, also, help, to, establish, dominance, rankings, among, the, young, to, avoid, conflicts, as, adults, john, byers, a, zoologist, at, the, university, of, idaho, discovered, that, the, amount, of, time, spent, at, play, for, many, mammals, e, g, rats, and, cats, peaks, around, puberty, and, then, drops, off, this, corresponds, to, the, development, of, the, cerebellum, suggesting, that, play, is, not, so, much, about, practicing, exact, behaviors, as, much, as, building, general, connections, in, the, brain, sergio, pellis, and, colleagues, at, the, university, of, lethbridge, in, alberta, canada, discovered, that, play, may, shape, the, brain, in, other, ways, too, young, mammals, have, an, overabundance, of, brain, cells, in, their, cerebrum, the, outer, areas, of, the, brain, part, of, what, distinguishes, mammals, there, is, evidence, that, play, helps, the, brain, clean, up, this, excess, of, cells, resulting, in, a, more, efficient, cerebrum, at, maturity, marc, bekoff, a, university, of, colorado, evolutionary, biologist, proposes, a, flexibility, hypothesis, that, attempts, to, incorporate, these, neurological, findings, it, argues, that, play, helps, animals, learn, to, switch, and, improvise, all, behaviors, more, effectively, to, be, prepared, for, the, unexpected, there, may, however, be, other, ways, to, acquire, even, these, benefits, of, play, the, concept, of, equifinality, the, social, benefits, of, play, for, many, animals, for, example, could, instead, be, garnered, by, grooming, patrick, bateson, maintains, that, equifinality, is, exactly, what, play, teaches, in, accordance, with, the, flexibility, hypothesis, play, may, teach, animals, to, avoid, false, endpoints, in, other, words, they, harness, the, childlike, tendency, to, keep, playing, with, something, that, works, well, enough, eventually, allowing, them, to, come, up, with, something, that, might, work, better, if, only, in, some, situations, this, also, allows, mammals, to, build, up, various, skills, that, could, come, in, handy, in, entirely, novel, situations, a, study, on, two, species, of, monkeys, semnopithecus, entellus, and, macaca, mulatta, that, came, into, association, with, each, other, during, food, provisioning, by, pilgrims, at, the, ambagarh, forest, reserve, near, jaipur, india, shows, the, interspecific, interaction, that, developed, between, the, juveniles, of, the, two, species, when, opportunity, presented, itself, learning, through, play, has, been, long, recognized, as, a, critical, aspect, of, childhood, and, child, development, some, of, the, earliest, studies, of, play, started, in, the, 1890s, with, g, stanley, hall, the, father, of, the, child, study, movement, that, sparked, an, interest, in, the, developmental, mental, and, behavioral, world, of, babies, and, children, play, promotes, healthy, development, of, parent, child, bonds, establishing, social, emotional, and, cognitive, developmental, milestones, that, help, them, relate, to, others, manage, stress, and, learn, resiliency, modern, research, in, the, field, of, affective, neuroscience, the, neural, mechanisms, of, emotion, has, uncovered, important, links, between, role, play, and, neurogenesis, in, the, brain, for, example, researcher, roger, caillois, used, the, word, ilinx, to, describe, the, momentary, disruption, of, perception, that, comes, from, forms, of, physical, play, that, disorient, the, senses, especially, balance, play, is, positively, correlated, with, coping, with, daily, stressors, in, children, by, playing, children, regulate, their, emotions, this, is, important, for, adaptive, functioning, because, without, regulation, emotions, could, be, overwhelming, and, stressful, evolutionary, psychologists, have, begun, to, explore, the, phylogenetic, relationship, between, higher, intelligence, in, humans, and, its, relationship, to, play, i, e, the, relationship, of, play, to, the, progress, of, whole, evolutionary, groups, as, opposed, to, the, psychological, implications, of, play, to, a, specific, individual, various, forms, of, play, physical, or, mental, influence, cognitive, abilities, in, individuals, as, little, as, ten, minutes, of, exercise, including, physical, play, can, improve, cognitive, abilities, an, exergame, is, a, game, that, incorporates, some, physical, movement, but, is, not, formal, exercise, such, games, increase, one, s, heart, rate, to, the, level, of, aerobics, exercise, and, result, in, significant, improvements, in, mental, faculties, such, as, math, and, recall, memory, playing, video, games, is, one, of, the, most, common, mediums, of, play, for, children, and, adults, today, there, have, been, mixed, reviews, on, the, effects, of, video, games, one, study, found, was, positively, associated, with, skills, strongly, related, to, academic, success, such, as, time, management, attention, executive, control, memory, and, spatial, abilities, when, playing, video, game, occurs, in, moderation, play, can, also, influence, one, s, social, development, and, social, interactions, much, of, the, research, focuses, on, the, influence, play, has, on, child, social, development, there, are, different, forms, of, play, that, influence, child, social, development, one, study, explored, the, influence, of, playing, styles, with, mothers, versus, playing, styles, with, fathers, and, how, it, influences, child, social, development, ntegral, to, positive, development, is, the, child, s, social, competence, or, more, precisely, the, ability, to, regulate, their, own, emotions, and, behaviors, in, the, social, contexts, of, early, childhood, to, support, the, effective, accomplishment, of, relevant, developmental, tasks, social, benefits, of, play, have, been, measured, using, basic, interpersonal, values, such, as, getting, along, with, peers, play, with, parents, reduces, anxiety, in, children, having, play, time, with, parents, that, involves, socially, acceptable, behaviour, makes, it, easier, for, children, to, relate, to, be, more, socially, adjusted, to, peers, at, school, or, at, play, social, development, involving, child, interaction, with, peers, is, thus, an, area, of, influence, for, playful, interactions, with, parents, and, peers, anji, play, in, simplified, chinese, in, traditional, chinese, is, an, educational, method, based, on, children, s, self, directed, play, in, outside, spaces, using, simple, tools, made, of, natural, material, the, teachers, and, instructors, only, observe, and, document, the, children, s, independent, play, the, method, was, created, by, cheng, xueqin, and, is, organized, as, two, hours, of, free, play, during, which, the, children, choose, the, available, material, they, want, to, use, and, build, structures, to, play, while, planning, experimenting, building, and, using, the, structures, to, play, the, children, have, the, opportunity, to, interact, with, peers, to, think, critically, about, what, may, work, to, discuss, the, plan, and, organize, the, construction, work, the, process, is, observed, and, recorded, by, the, teachers, and, instructors, without, intervention, even, in, instances, of, possible, risk, before, and, after, the, two, hours, of, play, the, children, have, the, opportunity, to, express, their, plans, and, discuss, with, their, peers, after, the, play, they, get, the, opportunity, to, draw, write, or, explain, what, they, did, then, they, watch, the, videos, recorded, the, same, day, and, explain, how, they, played, and, comment, on, each, other, s, creations, anji, play, is, also, called, true, play, and, its, guiding, principles, are, love, risk, joy, engagement, and, reflection, this, method, of, self, initiated, and, self, directed, play, is, applied, at, the, pre, schools, children, from, three, to, six, years, old, in, anji, county, east, china, media, related, to, play, at, wikimedia, commons
