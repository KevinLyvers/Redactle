sexual, orientation, is, an, enduring, personal, pattern, of, romantic, attraction, or, sexual, attraction, or, a, combination, of, these, to, persons, of, the, opposite, sex, or, gender, the, same, sex, or, gender, or, to, both, sexes, or, more, than, one, gender, patterns, are, generally, categorized, under, heterosexuality, homosexuality, and, bisexuality, while, asexuality, experiencing, no, sexual, attraction, to, others, is, sometimes, identified, as, the, fourth, category, these, categories, are, aspects, of, the, more, nuanced, nature, of, sexual, identity, and, terminology, for, example, people, may, use, other, labels, such, as, pansexual, or, polysexual, or, none, at, all, according, to, the, american, psychological, association, sexual, orientation, also, refers, to, a, person, s, sense, of, identity, based, on, those, attractions, related, behaviors, and, membership, in, a, community, of, others, who, share, those, attractions, androphilia, and, gynephilia, are, terms, used, in, behavioral, science, to, describe, sexual, orientation, as, an, alternative, to, a, gender, binary, conceptualization, androphilia, describes, sexual, attraction, to, masculinity, gynephilia, describes, the, sexual, attraction, to, femininity, the, term, sexual, preference, largely, overlaps, with, sexual, orientation, but, is, generally, distinguished, in, psychological, research, a, person, who, identifies, as, bisexual, for, example, may, sexually, prefer, one, sex, over, the, other, sexual, preference, may, also, suggest, a, degree, of, voluntary, choice, whereas, sexual, orientation, is, not, a, choice, scientists, do, not, know, the, exact, cause, of, sexual, orientation, but, they, theorize, that, it, is, caused, by, a, complex, interplay, of, genetic, hormonal, and, environmental, influences, although, no, single, theory, on, the, cause, of, sexual, orientation, has, yet, gained, widespread, support, scientists, favor, biologically, based, theories, there, is, considerably, more, evidence, supporting, nonsocial, biological, causes, of, sexual, orientation, than, social, ones, especially, for, males, there, is, no, substantive, evidence, which, suggests, parenting, or, early, childhood, experiences, play, a, role, with, regard, to, sexual, orientation, across, cultures, most, people, are, heterosexual, with, a, minority, of, people, having, a, homosexual, or, bisexual, orientation, 8, 9, 10, a, person, s, sexual, orientation, can, be, anywhere, on, a, continuum, from, exclusive, attraction, to, the, opposite, sex, to, exclusive, attraction, to, the, same, sex, sexual, orientation, is, studied, primarily, within, biology, anthropology, and, psychology, including, sexology, but, it, is, also, a, subject, area, in, sociology, history, including, social, constructionist, perspectives, and, law, sexual, orientation, is, traditionally, defined, as, including, heterosexuality, bisexuality, and, homosexuality, while, asexuality, is, considered, the, fourth, category, of, sexual, orientation, by, some, researchers, and, has, been, defined, as, the, absence, of, a, traditional, sexual, orientation, an, asexual, has, little, to, no, sexual, attraction, to, people, it, may, be, considered, a, lack, of, a, sexual, orientation, and, there, is, significant, debate, over, whether, or, not, it, is, a, sexual, orientation, most, definitions, of, sexual, orientation, include, a, psychological, component, such, as, the, direction, of, an, individual, s, erotic, desires, or, a, behavioral, component, which, focuses, on, the, sex, of, the, individual, s, sexual, partner, s, some, people, prefer, simply, to, follow, an, individual, s, self, definition, or, identity, scientific, and, professional, understanding, is, that, the, core, attractions, that, form, the, basis, for, adult, sexual, orientation, typically, emerge, between, middle, childhood, and, early, adolescence, sexual, orientation, differs, from, sexual, identity, in, that, it, encompasses, relationships, with, others, while, sexual, identity, is, a, concept, of, self, the, american, psychological, association, states, that, exual, orientation, refers, to, an, enduring, pattern, of, emotional, romantic, and, or, sexual, attractions, to, men, women, or, both, sexes, and, that, his, range, of, behaviors, and, attractions, has, been, described, in, various, cultures, and, nations, throughout, the, world, many, cultures, use, identity, labels, to, describe, people, who, express, these, attractions, in, the, united, states, the, most, frequent, labels, are, lesbians, women, attracted, to, women, gay, men, men, attracted, to, men, and, bisexuals, people, attracted, to, both, sexes, however, some, people, may, use, different, labels, or, none, at, all, they, additionally, state, that, sexual, orientation, is, distinct, from, other, components, of, sex, and, gender, including, biological, sex, the, anatomical, physiological, and, genetic, characteristics, associated, with, being, male, or, female, gender, identity, the, psychological, sense, of, being, male, or, female, and, social, gender, role, the, cultural, norms, that, define, feminine, and, masculine, behavior, sexual, identity, and, sexual, behavior, are, closely, related, to, sexual, orientation, but, they, are, distinguished, with, sexual, identity, referring, to, an, individual, s, conception, of, themselves, behavior, referring, to, actual, sexual, acts, performed, by, the, individual, and, orientation, referring, to, fantasies, attachments, and, longings, individuals, may, or, may, not, express, their, sexual, orientation, in, their, behaviors, people, who, have, a, non, heterosexual, sexual, orientation, that, does, not, align, with, their, sexual, identity, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, closeted, the, term, may, however, reflect, a, certain, cultural, context, and, particular, stage, of, transition, in, societies, which, are, gradually, dealing, with, integrating, sexual, minorities, in, studies, related, to, sexual, orientation, when, dealing, with, the, degree, to, which, a, person, s, sexual, attractions, behaviors, and, identity, match, scientists, usually, use, the, terms, concordance, or, discordance, thus, a, woman, who, is, attracted, to, other, women, but, calls, herself, heterosexual, and, only, has, sexual, relations, with, men, can, be, said, to, experience, discordance, between, her, sexual, orientation, homosexual, or, lesbian, and, her, sexual, identity, and, behaviors, heterosexual, sexual, identity, may, also, be, used, to, describe, a, person, s, perception, of, their, own, sex, rather, than, sexual, orientation, the, term, sexual, preference, has, a, similar, meaning, to, sexual, orientation, and, the, two, terms, are, often, used, interchangeably, but, the, american, psychological, association, states, sexual, preference, suggests, a, degree, of, voluntary, choice, the, term, has, been, listed, by, the, american, psychological, association, s, committee, on, gay, and, lesbian, concerns, as, a, wording, that, advances, a, heterosexual, bias, the, term, sexual, orientation, was, introduced, by, sexologist, john, money, in, place, of, sexual, preference, arguing, that, attraction, is, not, necessarily, a, matter, of, free, choice, androphilia, and, gynephilia, or, gynecophilia, are, terms, used, in, behavioral, science, to, describe, sexual, attraction, as, an, alternative, to, a, homosexual, and, heterosexual, conceptualization, they, are, used, for, identifying, a, subject, s, object, of, attraction, without, attributing, a, sex, assignment, or, gender, identity, to, the, subject, related, terms, such, as, pansexual, and, polysexual, do, not, make, any, such, assignations, to, the, subject, people, may, also, use, terms, such, as, queer, pansensual, polyfidelitous, ambisexual, or, personalized, identities, such, as, byke, or, biphilic, using, androphilia, and, gynephilia, can, avoid, confusion, and, offense, when, describing, people, in, non, western, cultures, as, well, as, when, describing, intersex, and, transgender, people, psychiatrist, anil, aggrawal, explains, that, androphilia, along, with, gynephilia, is, needed, to, overcome, immense, difficulties, in, characterizing, the, sexual, orientation, of, trans, men, and, trans, women, for, instance, it, is, difficult, to, decide, whether, a, trans, man, erotically, attracted, to, males, is, a, heterosexual, female, or, a, homosexual, male, or, a, trans, woman, erotically, attracted, to, females, is, a, heterosexual, male, or, a, lesbian, female, any, attempt, to, classify, them, may, not, only, cause, confusion, but, arouse, offense, among, the, affected, subjects, in, such, cases, while, defining, sexual, attraction, it, is, best, to, focus, on, the, object, of, their, attraction, rather, than, on, the, sex, or, gender, of, the, subject, sexologist, milton, diamond, writes, the, terms, heterosexual, homosexual, and, bisexual, are, better, used, as, adjectives, not, nouns, and, are, better, applied, to, behaviors, not, people, this, usage, is, particularly, advantageous, when, discussing, the, partners, of, transsexual, or, intersexed, individuals, these, newer, terms, also, do, not, carry, the, social, weight, of, the, former, ones, some, researchers, advocate, use, of, the, terminology, to, avoid, bias, inherent, in, western, conceptualizations, of, human, sexuality, writing, about, the, samoan, fa, afafine, demographic, sociologist, johanna, schmidt, writes, that, in, cultures, where, a, third, gender, is, recognized, a, term, like, homosexual, transsexual, does, not, align, with, cultural, categories, some, researchers, such, as, bruce, bagemihl, have, criticized, certain, ways, the, labels, heterosexual, and, homosexual, have, been, used, for, transgender, people, writing, the, point, of, reference, for, heterosexual, or, homosexual, orientation, in, this, nomenclature, is, solely, the, individual, s, genetic, sex, prior, to, reassignment, see, for, example, blanchard, et, al, 1987, coleman, and, bockting, 1988, blanchard, 1989, these, labels, thereby, ignore, the, individual, s, personal, sense, of, gender, identity, taking, precedence, over, biological, sex, rather, than, the, other, way, around, bagemihl, goes, on, to, take, issue, with, the, way, this, terminology, makes, it, easy, to, claim, transsexuals, are, really, homosexual, males, seeking, to, escape, from, stigma, terms, have, been, proposed, for, sexual, attraction, to, a, person, born, male, with, a, feminine, gender, expression, including, gynandromorphophilia, adjective, gynandromorphophilic, and, gynemimetophilia, adj, gynemimetophilic, the, earliest, writers, on, sexual, orientation, usually, understood, it, to, be, intrinsically, linked, to, the, subject, s, own, sex, for, example, it, was, thought, that, a, typical, female, bodied, person, who, is, attracted, to, female, bodied, persons, would, have, masculine, attributes, and, vice, versa, this, understanding, was, shared, by, most, of, the, significant, theorists, of, sexual, orientation, from, the, mid, nineteenth, to, early, twentieth, century, such, as, karl, heinrich, ulrichs, richard, von, krafft, ebing, magnus, hirschfeld, havelock, ellis, carl, jung, and, sigmund, freud, as, well, as, many, gender, variant, homosexual, people, themselves, however, this, understanding, of, homosexuality, as, sexual, inversion, was, disputed, at, the, time, and, through, the, second, half, of, the, twentieth, century, gender, identity, came, to, be, increasingly, seen, as, a, phenomenon, distinct, from, sexual, orientation, transgender, and, cisgender, people, may, be, attracted, to, men, women, or, both, although, the, prevalence, of, different, sexual, orientations, is, quite, different, in, these, two, populations, an, individual, homosexual, heterosexual, or, bisexual, person, may, be, masculine, feminine, or, androgynous, nevertheless, an, analysis, by, j, michael, bailey, and, kenneth, zucker, found, a, majority, of, the, gay, men, and, lesbians, sampled, in, multiple, studies, reported, substantially, more, cross, sex, typed, behavior, in, childhood, than, heterosexual, subjects, sexual, orientation, sees, greater, intricacy, when, non, binary, understandings, of, both, sex, and, gender, are, considered, sociologist, paula, rodriguez, rust, 2000, argues, for, a, more, multifaceted, definition, of, sexual, orientation, most, alternative, models, of, sexuality, define, sexual, orientation, in, terms, of, dichotomous, biological, sex, or, gender, most, theorists, would, not, eliminate, the, reference, to, sex, or, gender, but, instead, advocate, incorporating, more, complex, nonbinary, concepts, of, sex, or, gender, more, complex, relationships, between, sex, gender, and, sexuality, and, or, additional, nongendered, dimensions, into, models, of, sexuality, gay, and, lesbian, people, can, have, sexual, relationships, with, someone, of, the, opposite, sex, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, the, desire, for, a, perceived, traditional, family, and, concerns, of, discrimination, and, religious, ostracism, while, some, lgbt, people, hide, their, respective, orientations, from, their, spouses, others, develop, positive, gay, and, lesbian, identities, while, maintaining, successful, heterosexual, marriages, coming, out, of, the, closet, to, oneself, a, spouse, of, the, opposite, sex, and, children, can, present, challenges, that, are, not, faced, by, gay, and, lesbian, people, who, are, not, married, to, people, of, the, opposite, sex, or, do, not, have, children, often, sexual, orientation, and, sexual, orientation, identity, are, not, distinguished, which, can, impact, accurately, assessing, sexual, identity, and, whether, or, not, sexual, orientation, is, able, to, change, sexual, orientation, identity, can, change, throughout, an, individual, s, life, and, may, or, may, not, align, with, biological, sex, sexual, behavior, or, actual, sexual, orientation, sexual, orientation, is, stable, and, unchanging, for, the, vast, majority, of, people, but, some, research, indicates, that, some, people, may, experience, change, in, their, sexual, orientation, and, this, is, more, likely, for, women, than, for, men, the, american, psychological, association, distinguishes, between, sexual, orientation, an, innate, attraction, and, sexual, orientation, identity, which, may, change, at, any, point, in, a, person, s, life, the, exact, causes, for, the, development, of, a, particular, sexual, orientation, have, yet, to, be, established, to, date, much, research, has, been, conducted, to, determine, the, influence, of, genetics, hormonal, action, development, dynamics, social, and, cultural, influences, which, has, led, many, to, think, that, biology, and, environment, factors, play, a, complex, role, in, forming, it, research, has, identified, several, biological, factors, which, may, be, related, to, the, development, of, sexual, orientation, including, genes, prenatal, hormones, and, brain, structure, no, single, controlling, cause, has, been, identified, and, research, is, continuing, in, this, area, although, researchers, generally, believe, that, sexual, orientation, is, not, determined, by, any, one, factor, but, by, a, combination, of, genetic, hormonal, and, environmental, influences, with, biological, factors, involving, a, complex, interplay, of, genetic, factors, and, the, early, uterine, environment, they, favor, biological, models, for, the, cause, there, is, considerably, more, evidence, supporting, nonsocial, biological, causes, of, sexual, orientation, than, social, ones, especially, for, males, scientists, do, not, believe, that, sexual, orientation, is, a, choice, and, some, of, them, believe, that, it, is, established, at, conception, current, scientific, investigation, usually, seeks, to, find, biological, explanations, for, the, adoption, of, a, particular, sexual, orientation, scientific, studies, have, found, a, number, of, statistical, biological, differences, between, gay, people, and, heterosexuals, which, may, result, from, the, same, underlying, cause, as, sexual, orientation, itself, genes, may, be, related, to, the, development, of, sexual, orientation, a, twin, study, from, 2001, appears, to, exclude, genes, as, a, major, factor, while, a, twin, study, from, 2010, found, that, homosexuality, was, explained, by, both, genes, and, environmental, factors, however, experimental, design, of, the, available, twin, studies, has, made, their, interpretation, difficult, in, 2012, a, large, comprehensive, genome, wide, linkage, study, of, male, sexual, orientation, was, conducted, by, several, independent, groups, of, researchers, significant, linkage, to, homosexuality, was, found, with, genes, on, chromosome, xq28, and, chromosome, 8, in, the, pericentromeric, region, the, authors, concluded, that, our, findings, taken, in, context, with, previous, work, suggest, that, genetic, variation, in, each, of, these, regions, contributes, to, development, of, the, important, psychological, trait, of, male, sexual, orientation, it, was, the, largest, study, of, the, genetic, basis, of, homosexuality, to, date, and, was, published, online, in, november, 2014, however, in, august, 2019, a, genome, wide, association, study, of, 493, 001, individuals, concluded, that, hundreds, or, thousands, of, genetic, variants, underlie, homosexual, behavior, in, both, sexes, with, 5, variants, in, particular, being, significantly, associated, they, stated, that, in, contrast, to, linkage, studies, that, found, substantial, association, of, sexual, orientation, with, variants, on, the, x, chromosome, they, found, no, excess, of, signal, and, no, individual, genome, wide, significant, variants, on, xq28, or, the, rest, of, the, x, chromosome, the, hormonal, theory, of, sexuality, holds, that, just, as, exposure, to, certain, hormones, plays, a, role, in, fetal, sex, differentiation, hormonal, exposure, also, influences, the, sexual, orientation, that, emerges, later, in, the, adult, fetal, hormones, may, be, seen, as, either, the, primary, influence, upon, adult, sexual, orientation, or, as, a, co, factor, interacting, with, genes, or, environmental, and, social, conditions, for, humans, the, norm, is, that, females, possess, two, x, sex, chromosomes, while, males, have, one, x, and, one, y, the, default, developmental, pathway, for, a, human, fetus, being, female, the, y, chromosome, is, what, induces, the, changes, necessary, to, shift, to, the, male, developmental, pathway, this, differentiation, process, is, driven, by, androgen, hormones, mainly, testosterone, and, dihydrotestosterone, dht, the, newly, formed, testicles, in, the, fetus, are, responsible, for, the, secretion, of, androgens, which, will, cooperate, in, driving, the, sexual, differentiation, of, the, developing, fetus, including, its, brain, this, results, in, sexual, differences, between, males, and, females, this, fact, has, led, some, scientists, to, test, in, various, ways, the, result, of, modifying, androgen, exposure, levels, in, mammals, during, fetus, and, early, life, a, significant, volume, of, research, has, demonstrated, that, the, probability, of, a, male, growing, up, to, be, gay, increases, with, each, older, brother, he, has, from, the, same, mother, known, as, the, fraternal, birth, order, fbo, effect, scientists, attribute, this, to, a, prenatal, biological, mechanism, specifically, a, maternal, immune, response, to, male, fetuses, since, the, effect, is, only, present, in, men, with, older, biological, brothers, and, not, present, among, men, with, older, step, brothers, and, adoptive, brothers, this, process, known, as, the, maternal, immunization, hypothesis, mih, would, begin, when, cells, from, a, male, fetus, enter, the, mother, s, circulation, during, pregnancy, these, cells, carry, y, proteins, which, are, thought, to, play, a, role, in, brain, masculinisation, sex, differentiation, during, fetal, development, the, mothers, immune, system, builds, antibodies, to, these, y, proteins, these, antibodies, are, later, released, on, future, male, fetuses, and, interfere, with, the, masculinization, role, of, y, proteins, leaving, regions, of, the, brain, responsible, for, sexual, orientation, in, the, default, female, typical, arrangement, causing, the, exposed, son, to, be, more, attracted, to, men, over, women, biochemical, evidence, for, this, hypothesis, was, identified, in, 2017, finding, that, mothers, with, a, gay, son, especially, those, with, older, brothers, had, significantly, higher, levels, of, anti, bodies, to, the, nlgn4y, y, protein, than, mothers, with, heterosexual, sons, the, effect, becomes, stronger, with, each, successive, male, pregnancy, meaning, the, odds, of, the, next, son, being, gay, increase, by, 38, 48, this, does, not, mean, that, all, or, most, sons, will, be, gay, after, several, male, pregnancies, but, rather, the, odds, of, having, a, gay, son, increase, from, approximately, 2, for, the, first, born, son, to, 4, for, the, second, 6, for, the, third, and, so, on, scientists, have, estimated, between, 15, and, 29, of, gay, men, may, owe, their, sexual, orientation, to, this, effect, but, the, number, may, be, higher, as, prior, miscarriages, and, terminations, of, male, pregnancies, may, have, exposed, their, mothers, to, y, linked, antigens, the, fraternal, birth, order, effect, would, not, likely, apply, to, first, born, gay, sons, instead, scientists, say, they, may, owe, their, orientation, to, genes, prenatal, hormones, and, other, maternal, immune, responses, which, also, influence, brain, development, this, effect, is, nullified, if, the, man, is, left, handed, ray, blanchard, and, anthony, bogaert, are, credited, with, discovering, the, effect, in, the, 1990s, j, michael, bailey, and, jacques, balthazart, say, the, fbo, effect, demonstrates, that, sexual, orientation, is, heavily, influenced, by, prenatal, biological, mechanisms, rather, than, unidentified, factors, in, socialization, in, the, field, of, genetics, any, factor, which, is, non, genetic, is, considered, an, environmental, influence, however, environmental, influence, does, not, automatically, imply, that, the, social, environment, influences, or, contributes, to, the, development, of, sexual, orientation, there, is, a, vast, non, social, environment, that, is, non, genetic, yet, still, biological, such, as, prenatal, development, that, likely, helps, shape, sexual, orientation, 76, there, is, no, substantive, evidence, to, support, the, suggestion, that, early, childhood, experiences, parenting, sexual, abuse, or, other, adverse, life, events, influence, sexual, orientation, hypotheses, for, the, impact, of, the, post, natal, social, environment, on, sexual, orientation, are, weak, especially, for, males, parental, attitudes, may, affect, whether, or, not, children, openly, identify, with, their, sexual, orientation, though, it, has, since, been, found, to, be, based, on, prejudice, and, misinformation, it, was, once, thought, that, homosexuality, was, the, result, of, faulty, psychological, development, resulting, from, childhood, experiences, and, troubled, relationships, including, childhood, sexual, abuse, such, hypotheses, have, been, associated, with, highly, charged, political, moral, and, theological, grounds, for, wanting, to, believe, that, it, can, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, in, 2004, stated, the, mechanisms, for, the, development, of, a, particular, sexual, orientation, remain, unclear, but, the, current, literature, and, most, scholars, in, the, field, state, that, one, s, sexual, orientation, is, not, a, choice, that, is, individuals, do, not, choose, to, be, homosexual, or, heterosexual, a, variety, of, theories, about, the, influences, on, sexual, orientation, have, been, proposed, sexual, orientation, probably, is, not, determined, by, any, one, factor, but, by, a, combination, of, genetic, hormonal, and, environmental, influences, in, recent, decades, biologically, based, theories, have, been, favored, by, experts, although, there, continues, to, be, controversy, and, uncertainty, as, to, the, genesis, of, the, variety, of, human, sexual, orientations, there, is, no, scientific, evidence, that, abnormal, parenting, sexual, abuse, or, other, adverse, life, events, influence, sexual, orientation, current, knowledge, suggests, that, sexual, orientation, is, usually, established, during, early, childhood, the, american, psychological, association, the, american, psychiatric, association, and, the, national, association, of, social, workers, in, 2006, stated, currently, there, is, no, scientific, consensus, about, the, specific, factors, that, cause, an, individual, to, become, heterosexual, homosexual, or, bisexual, including, possible, biological, psychological, or, social, effects, of, the, parents, sexual, orientation, however, the, available, evidence, indicates, that, the, vast, majority, of, lesbian, and, gay, adults, were, raised, by, heterosexual, parents, and, the, vast, majority, of, children, raised, by, lesbian, and, gay, parents, eventually, grow, up, to, be, heterosexual, the, royal, college, of, psychiatrists, in, 2007, stated, despite, almost, a, century, of, psychoanalytic, and, psychological, speculation, there, is, no, substantive, evidence, to, support, the, suggestion, that, the, nature, of, parenting, or, early, childhood, experiences, play, any, role, in, the, formation, of, a, person, s, fundamental, heterosexual, or, homosexual, orientation, it, would, appear, that, sexual, orientation, is, biological, in, nature, determined, by, a, complex, interplay, of, genetic, factors, and, the, early, uterine, environment, sexual, orientation, is, therefore, not, a, choice, though, sexual, behaviour, clearly, is, the, american, psychiatric, association, stated, in, 2011, no, one, knows, what, causes, heterosexuality, homosexuality, or, bisexuality, homosexuality, was, once, thought, to, be, the, result, of, troubled, family, dynamics, or, faulty, psychological, development, those, assumptions, are, now, understood, to, have, been, based, on, misinformation, and, prejudice, a, legal, brief, dated, september, 26, 2007, and, presented, on, behalf, of, the, american, psychological, association, california, psychological, association, american, psychiatric, association, national, association, of, social, workers, and, national, association, of, social, workers, california, chapter, stated, although, much, research, has, examined, the, possible, genetic, hormonal, developmental, social, and, cultural, influences, on, sexual, orientation, no, findings, have, emerged, that, permit, scientists, to, conclude, that, sexual, orientation, heterosexuality, homosexuality, or, bisexuality, is, determined, by, any, particular, factor, or, factors, the, evaluation, of, amici, is, that, although, some, of, this, research, may, be, promising, in, facilitating, greater, understanding, of, the, development, of, sexual, orientation, it, does, not, permit, a, conclusion, based, in, sound, science, at, the, present, time, as, to, the, cause, or, causes, of, sexual, orientation, whether, homosexual, bisexual, or, heterosexual, sexual, orientation, change, efforts, are, methods, that, aim, to, change, a, same, sex, sexual, orientation, they, may, include, behavioral, techniques, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, reparative, therapy, psychoanalytic, techniques, medical, approaches, and, religious, and, spiritual, approaches, no, major, mental, health, professional, organization, sanctions, efforts, to, change, sexual, orientation, and, virtually, all, of, them, have, adopted, policy, statements, cautioning, the, profession, and, the, public, about, treatments, that, purport, to, change, sexual, orientation, these, include, the, american, psychiatric, association, american, psychological, association, american, counseling, association, national, association, of, social, workers, in, the, us, the, royal, college, of, psychiatrists, and, the, australian, psychological, society, in, 2009, the, american, psychological, association, task, force, on, appropriate, therapeutic, responses, to, sexual, orientation, conducted, a, systematic, review, of, the, peer, reviewed, journal, literature, on, sexual, orientation, change, efforts, soce, and, concluded, efforts, to, change, sexual, orientation, are, unlikely, to, be, successful, and, involve, some, risk, of, harm, contrary, to, the, claims, of, soce, practitioners, and, advocates, even, though, the, research, and, clinical, literature, demonstrate, that, same, sex, sexual, and, romantic, attractions, feelings, and, behaviors, are, normal, and, positive, variations, of, human, sexuality, regardless, of, sexual, orientation, identity, the, task, force, concluded, that, the, population, that, undergoes, soce, tends, to, have, strongly, conservative, religious, views, that, lead, them, to, seek, to, change, their, sexual, orientation, thus, the, appropriate, application, of, affirmative, therapeutic, interventions, for, those, who, seek, soce, involves, therapist, acceptance, support, and, understanding, of, clients, and, the, facilitation, of, clients, active, coping, social, support, and, identity, exploration, and, development, without, imposing, a, specific, sexual, orientation, identity, outcome, in, 2012, the, pan, american, health, organization, the, north, and, south, american, branch, of, the, world, health, organization, released, a, statement, cautioning, against, services, that, purport, to, cure, people, with, non, heterosexual, sexual, orientations, as, they, lack, medical, justification, and, represent, a, threat, to, the, health, and, well, being, of, affected, people, they, noted, that, the, global, scientific, and, professional, consensus, is, that, homosexuality, is, a, normal, and, natural, variation, of, human, sexuality, and, cannot, be, regarded, as, a, pathological, condition, the, pan, american, health, organization, further, called, on, governments, academic, institutions, professional, associations, and, the, media, to, expose, these, practices, and, to, promote, respect, for, diversity, the, world, health, organization, affiliate, further, noted, that, gay, minors, have, sometimes, been, forced, to, attend, these, therapies, involuntarily, being, deprived, of, their, liberty, and, sometimes, kept, in, isolation, for, several, months, additionally, the, pan, american, health, organization, recommended, that, such, malpractices, be, denounced, and, subject, to, sanctions, and, penalties, under, national, legislation, as, they, constitute, a, violation, of, the, ethical, principles, of, health, care, and, violate, human, rights, that, are, protected, by, international, and, regional, agreements, the, national, association, for, research, therapy, of, homosexuality, narth, which, described, itself, as, a, professional, scientific, organization, that, offers, hope, to, those, who, struggle, with, unwanted, homosexuality, disagreed, with, the, mainstream, mental, health, community, s, position, on, conversion, therapy, both, on, its, effectiveness, and, by, describing, sexual, orientation, not, as, a, binary, immutable, quality, or, as, a, disease, but, as, a, continuum, of, intensities, of, sexual, attractions, and, emotional, affect, the, american, psychological, association, and, the, royal, college, of, psychiatrists, expressed, concerns, that, the, positions, espoused, by, narth, are, not, supported, by, the, science, and, create, an, environment, in, which, prejudice, and, discrimination, can, flourish, varying, definitions, and, strong, social, norms, about, sexuality, can, make, sexual, orientation, difficult, to, quantify, one, of, the, earliest, sexual, orientation, classification, schemes, was, proposed, in, the, 1860s, by, karl, heinrich, ulrichs, in, a, series, of, pamphlets, he, published, privately, the, classification, scheme, which, was, meant, only, to, describe, males, separated, them, into, three, basic, categories, dionings, urnings, and, uranodionings, an, urning, can, be, further, categorized, by, degree, of, effeminacy, these, categories, directly, correspond, with, the, categories, of, sexual, orientation, used, today, heterosexual, homosexual, and, bisexual, in, the, series, of, pamphlets, ulrichs, outlined, a, set, of, questions, to, determine, if, a, man, was, an, urning, the, definitions, of, each, category, of, ulrichs, classification, scheme, are, as, follows, from, at, least, the, late, nineteenth, century, in, europe, there, was, speculation, that, the, range, of, human, sexual, response, looked, more, like, a, continuum, than, two, or, three, discrete, categories, berlin, sexologist, magnus, hirschfeld, published, a, scheme, in, 1896, that, measured, the, strength, of, an, individual, s, sexual, desire, on, two, independent, 10, point, scales, a, homosexual, and, b, heterosexual, a, heterosexual, individual, may, be, a0, b5, a, homosexual, individual, may, be, a5, b0, an, asexual, would, be, a0, b0, and, someone, with, an, intense, attraction, to, both, sexes, would, be, a9, b9, the, kinsey, scale, also, called, the, heterosexual, homosexual, rating, scale, was, first, published, in, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, male, 1948, by, alfred, kinsey, wardell, pomeroy, and, clyde, martin, and, also, featured, in, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, female, 1953, the, scale, was, developed, to, combat, the, assumption, at, the, time, that, people, are, either, heterosexual, or, homosexual, and, that, these, two, types, represent, antitheses, in, the, sexual, world, recognizing, that, a, significant, portion, of, the, population, is, not, completely, heterosexual, or, homosexual, and, that, such, people, can, experience, both, heterosexual, and, homosexual, behavior, and, psychic, responses, kinsey, et, al, stated, males, do, not, represent, two, discrete, populations, heterosexual, and, homosexual, the, world, is, not, to, be, divided, into, sheep, and, goats, not, all, things, are, black, nor, all, things, white, the, living, world, is, a, continuum, in, each, and, every, one, of, its, aspects, the, sooner, we, learn, this, concerning, human, sexual, behavior, the, sooner, we, shall, reach, a, sound, understanding, of, the, realities, of, sex, the, kinsey, scale, provides, a, classification, of, sexual, orientation, based, on, the, relative, amounts, of, heterosexual, and, homosexual, experience, or, psychic, response, in, one, s, history, at, a, given, time, the, classification, scheme, works, such, that, individuals, in, the, same, category, show, the, same, balance, between, the, heterosexual, and, homosexual, elements, in, their, histories, the, position, on, the, scale, is, based, on, the, relation, of, heterosexuality, to, homosexuality, in, one, s, history, rather, than, the, actual, amount, of, overt, experience, or, psychic, response, an, individual, can, be, assigned, a, position, on, the, scale, in, accordance, with, the, following, definitions, of, the, points, of, the, scale, the, kinsey, scale, has, been, praised, for, dismissing, the, dichotomous, classification, of, sexual, orientation, and, allowing, for, a, new, perspective, on, human, sexuality, despite, seven, categories, being, able, to, provide, a, more, accurate, description, of, sexual, orientation, than, a, dichotomous, scale, it, is, still, difficult, to, determine, which, category, individuals, should, be, assigned, to, in, a, major, study, comparing, sexual, response, in, homosexual, males, and, females, masters, and, johnson, discuss, the, difficulty, of, assigning, the, kinsey, ratings, to, participants, particularly, they, found, it, difficult, to, determine, the, relative, amount, heterosexual, and, homosexual, experience, and, response, in, a, person, s, history, when, using, the, scale, they, report, finding, it, difficult, to, assign, ratings, 2, 4, for, individuals, with, a, large, number, of, heterosexual, and, homosexual, experiences, when, there, are, a, substantial, number, of, heterosexual, and, homosexual, experiences, in, one, s, history, it, becomes, difficult, for, that, individual, to, be, fully, objective, in, assessing, the, relative, amount, of, each, weinrich, et, al, 1993, and, weinberg, et, al, 1994, criticized, the, scale, for, lumping, individuals, who, are, different, based, on, different, dimensions, of, sexuality, into, the, same, categories, when, applying, the, scale, kinsey, considered, two, dimensions, of, sexual, orientation, overt, sexual, experience, and, psychosexual, reactions, valuable, information, was, lost, by, collapsing, the, two, values, into, one, final, score, a, person, who, has, only, predominantly, same, sex, reactions, is, different, from, someone, with, relatively, little, reaction, but, much, same, sex, experience, it, would, have, been, quite, simple, for, kinsey, to, have, measured, the, two, dimensions, separately, and, report, scores, independently, to, avoid, loss, of, information, furthermore, there, are, more, than, two, dimensions, of, sexuality, to, be, considered, beyond, behavior, and, reactions, one, could, also, assess, attraction, identification, lifestyle, etc, this, is, addressed, by, the, klein, sexual, orientation, grid, a, third, concern, with, the, kinsey, scale, is, that, it, inappropriately, measures, heterosexuality, and, homosexuality, on, the, same, scale, making, one, a, tradeoff, of, the, other, research, in, the, 1970s, on, masculinity, and, femininity, found, that, concepts, of, masculinity, and, femininity, are, more, appropriately, measured, as, independent, concepts, on, a, separate, scale, rather, than, as, a, single, continuum, with, each, end, representing, opposite, extremes, when, compared, on, the, same, scale, they, act, as, tradeoffs, such, whereby, to, be, more, feminine, one, had, to, be, less, masculine, and, vice, versa, however, if, they, are, considered, as, separate, dimensions, one, can, be, simultaneously, very, masculine, and, very, feminine, similarly, considering, heterosexuality, and, homosexuality, on, separate, scales, would, allow, one, to, be, both, very, heterosexual, and, very, homosexual, or, not, very, much, of, either, when, they, are, measured, independently, the, degree, of, heterosexual, and, homosexual, can, be, independently, determined, rather, than, the, balance, between, heterosexual, and, homosexual, as, determined, using, the, kinsey, scale, in, response, to, the, criticism, of, the, kinsey, scale, only, measuring, two, dimensions, of, sexual, orientation, fritz, klein, developed, the, klein, sexual, orientation, grid, ksog, a, multidimensional, scale, for, describing, sexual, orientation, introduced, in, klein, s, book, the, bisexual, option, 1978, the, ksog, uses, a, 7, point, scale, to, assess, seven, different, dimensions, of, sexuality, at, three, different, points, in, an, individual, s, life, past, from, early, adolescence, up, to, one, year, ago, present, within, the, last, 12, months, and, ideal, what, the, individual, would, choose, if, it, were, completely, their, choice, the, sell, assessment, of, sexual, orientation, saso, was, developed, to, address, the, major, concerns, with, the, kinsey, scale, and, klein, sexual, orientation, grid, and, as, such, measures, sexual, orientation, on, a, continuum, considers, various, dimensions, of, sexual, orientation, and, considers, homosexuality, and, heterosexuality, separately, rather, than, providing, a, final, solution, to, the, question, of, how, to, best, measure, sexual, orientation, the, saso, is, meant, to, provoke, discussion, and, debate, about, measurements, of, sexual, orientation, the, saso, consists, of, 12, questions, six, of, these, questions, assess, sexual, attraction, four, assess, sexual, behavior, and, two, assess, sexual, orientation, identity, for, each, question, on, the, scale, that, measures, homosexuality, there, is, a, corresponding, question, that, measures, heterosexuality, giving, six, matching, pairs, of, questions, taken, all, together, the, six, pairs, of, questions, and, responses, provide, a, profile, of, an, individual, s, sexual, orientation, however, results, can, be, further, simplified, into, four, summaries, that, look, specifically, at, responses, that, correspond, to, either, homosexuality, heterosexuality, bisexuality, or, asexuality, of, all, the, questions, on, the, scale, sell, considered, those, assessing, sexual, attraction, to, be, the, most, important, as, sexual, attraction, is, a, better, reflection, of, the, concept, of, sexual, orientation, which, he, defined, as, extent, of, sexual, attractions, toward, members, of, the, other, same, both, sexes, or, neither, than, either, sexual, identity, or, sexual, behavior, identity, and, behavior, are, measured, as, supplemental, information, because, they, are, both, closely, tied, to, sexual, attraction, and, sexual, orientation, major, criticisms, of, the, saso, have, not, been, established, but, a, concern, is, that, the, reliability, and, validity, remains, largely, unexamined, research, focusing, on, sexual, orientation, uses, scales, of, assessment, to, identify, who, belongs, in, which, sexual, population, group, it, is, assumed, that, these, scales, will, be, able, to, reliably, identify, and, categorize, people, by, their, sexual, orientation, however, it, is, difficult, to, determine, an, individual, s, sexual, orientation, through, scales, of, assessment, due, to, ambiguity, regarding, the, definition, of, sexual, orientation, generally, there, are, three, components, of, sexual, orientation, used, in, assessment, their, definitions, and, examples, of, how, they, may, be, assessed, are, as, follows, though, sexual, attraction, behavior, and, identity, are, all, components, of, sexual, orientation, if, a, person, defined, by, one, of, these, dimensions, were, congruent, with, those, defined, by, another, dimension, it, would, not, matter, which, was, used, in, assessing, orientation, but, this, is, not, the, case, there, is, little, coherent, relationship, between, the, amount, and, mix, of, homosexual, and, heterosexual, behavior, in, a, person, s, biography, and, that, person, s, choice, to, label, himself, or, herself, as, bisexual, homosexual, or, heterosexual, individuals, typically, experience, diverse, attractions, and, behaviors, that, may, reflect, curiosity, experimentation, social, pressure, and, is, not, necessarily, indicative, of, an, underlying, sexual, orientation, for, example, a, woman, may, have, fantasies, or, thoughts, about, sex, with, other, women, but, never, act, on, these, thoughts, and, only, have, sex, with, opposite, gender, partners, if, sexual, orientation, was, being, assessed, based, on, one, s, sexual, attraction, then, this, individual, would, be, considered, homosexual, but, her, behavior, indicates, heterosexuality, as, there, is, no, research, indicating, which, of, the, three, components, is, essential, in, defining, sexual, orientation, all, three, are, used, independently, and, provide, different, conclusions, regarding, sexual, orientation, savin, williams, 2006, discusses, this, issue, and, notes, that, by, basing, findings, regarding, sexual, orientation, on, a, single, component, researchers, may, not, actually, capture, the, intended, population, for, example, if, homosexual, is, defined, by, same, sex, behavior, gay, virgins, are, omitted, heterosexuals, engaging, in, same, sex, behavior, for, other, reasons, than, preferred, sexual, arousal, are, miscounted, and, those, with, same, sex, attraction, who, only, have, opposite, sex, relations, are, excluded, because, of, the, limited, populations, that, each, component, captures, consumers, of, research, should, be, cautious, in, generalizing, these, findings, one, of, the, uses, for, scales, that, assess, sexual, orientation, is, determining, what, the, prevalence, of, different, sexual, orientations, are, within, a, population, depending, on, subject, s, age, culture, and, sex, the, prevalence, rates, of, homosexuality, vary, depending, on, which, component, of, sexual, orientation, is, being, assessed, sexual, attraction, sexual, behavior, or, sexual, identity, assessing, sexual, attraction, will, yield, the, greatest, prevalence, of, homosexuality, in, a, population, whereby, the, proportion, of, individuals, indicating, they, are, same, sex, attracted, is, two, to, three, times, greater, than, the, proportion, reporting, same, sex, behavior, or, identify, as, gay, lesbian, or, bisexual, furthermore, reports, of, same, sex, behavior, usually, exceed, those, of, gay, lesbian, or, bisexual, identification, the, following, chart, demonstrates, how, widely, the, prevalence, of, homosexuality, can, vary, depending, on, what, age, location, and, component, of, sexual, orientation, is, being, assessed, the, variance, in, prevalence, rates, is, reflected, in, people, s, inconsistent, responses, to, the, different, components, of, sexual, orientation, within, a, study, and, the, instability, of, their, responses, over, time, laumann, et, al, 1994, found, that, among, u, s, adults, 20, of, those, who, would, be, considered, homosexual, on, one, component, of, orientation, were, homosexual, on, the, other, two, dimensions, and, 70, responded, in, a, way, that, was, consistent, with, homosexuality, on, only, one, of, the, three, dimensions, furthermore, sexuality, may, be, fluid, for, example, a, person, s, sexual, orientation, identity, is, not, necessarily, stable, or, consistent, over, time, but, is, subject, to, change, throughout, life, diamond, 2003, found, that, over, seven, years, two, thirds, of, the, women, changed, their, sexual, identity, at, least, once, with, many, reporting, that, the, label, was, not, adequate, in, capturing, the, diversity, of, their, sexual, or, romantic, feelings, furthermore, women, who, relinquished, bisexual, and, lesbian, identification, did, not, relinquish, same, sex, sexuality, and, acknowledged, the, possibility, for, future, same, sex, attractions, or, behaviour, one, woman, stated, i, m, mainly, straight, but, i, m, one, of, those, people, who, if, the, right, circumstance, came, along, would, change, my, viewpoint, therefore, individuals, classified, as, homosexual, in, one, study, might, not, be, identified, the, same, way, in, another, depending, on, which, components, are, assessed, and, when, the, assessment, is, made, making, it, difficult, to, pin, point, who, is, homosexual, and, who, is, not, and, what, the, overall, prevalence, within, a, population, may, be, depending, on, which, component, of, sexual, orientation, is, being, assessed, and, referenced, different, conclusions, can, be, drawn, about, the, prevalence, rate, of, homosexuality, which, has, real, world, consequences, knowing, how, much, of, the, population, is, made, up, of, homosexual, individuals, influences, how, this, population, may, be, seen, or, treated, by, the, public, and, government, bodies, for, example, if, homosexual, individuals, constitute, only, 1, of, the, general, population, they, are, politically, easier, to, ignore, or, than, if, they, are, known, to, be, a, constituency, that, surpasses, most, ethnic, and, minority, groups, if, the, number, is, relatively, minor, then, it, is, difficult, to, argue, for, community, based, same, sex, programs, and, services, mass, media, inclusion, of, gay, role, models, or, gay, straight, alliances, in, schools, for, this, reason, in, the, 1970s, bruce, voeller, the, chair, of, the, national, gay, and, lesbian, task, force, perpetuated, a, common, myth, that, the, prevalence, of, homosexuality, is, 10, for, the, whole, population, by, averaging, a, 13, number, for, men, and, a, 7, number, for, women, voeller, generalized, this, finding, and, used, it, as, part, of, the, modern, gay, rights, movement, to, convince, politicians, and, the, public, that, we, are, everywhere, in, the, paper, who, s, gay, does, it, matter, psychologist, ritch, savin, williams, proposes, two, different, approaches, to, assessing, sexual, orientation, until, well, positioned, and, psychometrically, sound, and, tested, definitions, are, developed, that, would, allow, research, to, reliably, identify, the, prevalence, causes, and, consequences, of, homosexuality, he, first, suggests, that, greater, priority, should, be, given, to, sexual, arousal, and, attraction, over, behaviour, and, identity, because, it, is, less, prone, to, self, and, other, deception, social, conditions, and, variable, meanings, to, measure, attraction, and, arousal, he, proposed, that, biological, measures, should, be, developed, and, used, there, are, numerous, biological, physiological, measures, that, exist, that, can, measure, sexual, orientation, such, as, sexual, arousal, brain, scans, eye, tracking, body, odour, preference, and, anatomical, variations, such, as, digit, length, ratio, and, right, or, left, handedness, secondly, savin, williams, suggests, that, researchers, should, forsake, the, general, notion, of, sexual, orientation, altogether, and, assess, only, those, components, that, are, relevant, to, the, research, question, being, investigated, for, example, means, typically, used, include, surveys, interviews, cross, cultural, studies, physical, arousal, measurements, sexual, behavior, sexual, fantasy, or, a, pattern, of, erotic, arousal, the, most, common, is, verbal, self, reporting, or, self, labeling, which, depend, on, respondents, being, accurate, about, themselves, studying, human, sexual, arousal, has, proved, a, fruitful, way, of, understanding, how, men, and, women, differ, as, genders, and, in, terms, of, sexual, orientation, a, clinical, measurement, may, use, penile, or, vaginal, photoplethysmography, where, genital, engorgement, with, blood, is, measured, in, response, to, exposure, to, different, erotic, material, some, researchers, who, study, sexual, orientation, argue, that, the, concept, may, apply, differently, for, men, and, women, a, study, of, sexual, arousal, patterns, found, that, women, when, viewing, erotic, films, which, show, female, female, male, male, and, male, female, sexual, activity, oral, sex, or, penetration, have, patterns, of, arousal, which, do, not, match, their, declared, sexual, orientations, as, well, as, men, s, that, is, heterosexual, and, lesbian, women, s, sexual, arousal, to, erotic, films, do, not, differ, significantly, by, the, genders, of, the, participants, male, or, female, or, by, the, type, of, sexual, activity, heterosexual, or, homosexual, men, s, sexual, arousal, patterns, tend, to, be, more, in, line, with, their, stated, orientations, with, heterosexual, men, showing, more, penis, arousal, to, female, female, sexual, activity, and, less, arousal, to, female, male, and, male, male, sexual, stimuli, and, homosexual, and, bisexual, men, being, more, aroused, by, films, depicting, male, male, intercourse, and, less, aroused, by, other, stimuli, another, study, on, men, and, women, s, patterns, of, sexual, arousal, confirmed, that, men, and, women, have, different, patterns, of, arousal, independent, of, their, sexual, orientations, the, study, found, that, women, s, genitals, become, aroused, to, both, human, and, nonhuman, stimuli, from, movies, showing, humans, of, both, genders, having, sex, heterosexual, and, homosexual, and, from, videos, showing, non, human, primates, bonobos, having, sex, men, did, not, show, any, sexual, arousal, to, non, human, visual, stimuli, their, arousal, patterns, being, in, line, with, their, specific, sexual, interest, women, for, heterosexual, men, and, men, for, homosexual, men, these, studies, suggest, that, men, and, women, are, different, in, terms, of, sexual, arousal, patterns, and, that, this, is, also, reflected, in, how, their, genitals, react, to, sexual, stimuli, of, both, genders, or, even, to, non, human, stimuli, sexual, orientation, has, many, dimensions, attractions, behavior, identity, of, which, sexual, arousal, is, the, only, product, of, sexual, attractions, which, can, be, measured, at, present, with, some, degree, of, physical, precision, thus, the, fact, that, women, are, aroused, by, seeing, non, human, primates, having, sex, does, not, mean, that, women, s, sexual, orientation, includes, this, type, of, sexual, interest, some, researchers, argue, that, women, s, sexual, orientation, depends, less, on, their, patterns, of, sexual, arousal, than, men, s, and, that, other, components, of, sexual, orientation, like, emotional, attachment, must, be, taken, into, account, when, describing, women, s, sexual, orientations, in, contrast, men, s, sexual, orientations, tend, to, be, primarily, focused, on, the, physical, component, of, attractions, and, thus, their, sexual, feelings, are, more, exclusively, oriented, according, to, sex, more, recently, scientists, have, started, to, focus, on, measuring, changes, in, brain, activity, related, to, sexual, arousal, by, using, brain, scanning, techniques, a, study, on, how, heterosexual, and, homosexual, men, s, brains, react, to, seeing, pictures, of, naked, men, and, women, has, found, that, both, hetero, and, homosexual, men, react, positively, to, seeing, their, preferred, sex, using, the, same, brain, regions, the, only, significant, group, difference, between, these, orientations, was, found, in, the, amygdala, a, brain, region, known, to, be, involved, in, regulating, fear, research, suggests, that, sexual, orientation, is, independent, of, cultural, and, other, social, influences, but, that, open, identification, of, one, s, sexual, orientation, may, be, hindered, by, homophobic, heterosexist, settings, social, systems, such, as, religion, language, and, ethnic, traditions, can, have, a, powerful, impact, on, realization, of, sexual, orientation, influences, of, culture, may, complicate, the, process, of, measuring, sexual, orientation, the, majority, of, empirical, and, clinical, research, on, lgbt, populations, are, done, with, largely, white, middle, class, well, educated, samples, however, there, are, pockets, of, research, that, document, various, other, cultural, groups, although, these, are, frequently, limited, in, diversity, of, gender, and, sexual, orientation, of, the, subjects, integration, of, sexual, orientation, with, sociocultural, identity, may, be, a, challenge, for, lgbt, individuals, individuals, may, or, may, not, consider, their, sexual, orientation, to, define, their, sexual, identity, as, they, may, experience, various, degrees, of, fluidity, of, sexuality, or, may, simply, identify, more, strongly, with, another, aspect, of, their, identity, such, as, family, role, american, culture, puts, a, great, emphasis, on, individual, attributes, and, views, the, self, as, unchangeable, and, constant, in, contrast, east, asian, cultures, put, a, great, emphasis, on, a, person, s, social, role, within, social, hierarchies, and, view, the, self, as, fluid, and, malleable, these, differing, cultural, perspectives, have, many, implications, on, cognition, of, the, self, including, perception, of, sexual, orientation, translation, is, a, major, obstacle, when, comparing, different, cultures, many, english, terms, lack, equivalents, in, other, languages, while, concepts, and, words, from, other, languages, fail, to, be, reflected, in, the, english, language, translation, and, vocabulary, obstacles, are, not, limited, to, the, english, language, language, can, force, individuals, to, identify, with, a, label, that, may, or, may, not, accurately, reflect, their, true, sexual, orientation, language, can, also, be, used, to, signal, sexual, orientation, to, others, the, meaning, of, words, referencing, categories, of, sexual, orientation, are, negotiated, in, the, mass, media, in, relation, to, social, organization, new, words, may, be, brought, into, use, to, describe, new, terms, or, better, describe, complex, interpretations, of, sexual, orientation, other, words, may, pick, up, new, layers, or, meaning, for, example, the, heterosexual, spanish, terms, marido, and, mujer, for, husband, and, wife, respectively, have, recently, been, replaced, in, spain, by, the, gender, neutral, terms, c, nyuges, or, consortes, meaning, spouses, one, person, may, presume, knowledge, of, another, person, s, sexual, orientation, based, upon, perceived, characteristics, such, as, appearance, clothing,

as, gaydar, some, studies, have, found, that, guesses, based, on, face, photos, perform, better, than, chance, 2015, research, suggests, that, gaydar, is, an, alternate, label, for, using, lgbt, stereotypes, to, infer, orientation, and, that, face, shape, is, not, an, accurate, indication, of, orientation, perceived, sexual, orientation, may, affect, how, a, person, is, treated, for,

sexual, role, active, passive, insertive, penetrated, in, this, distinction, the, passive, role, is, typically, associated, with, femininity, or, inferiority, while, the, active, role, is, typically, associated, with, masculinity, or, superiority, for, example, an, investigation, of, a, small, brazilian, fishing, village, revealed, three, sexual, categories, for, men, men, who, have, sex, only, with, men, consistently, in, a, passive, role, men, who, have, sex, only, with, women, and, men, who, have, sex, with, women, and, men, consistently, in, an, active, role, while, men, who, consistently, occupied, the, passive, role, were, recognized, as, a, distinct, group, by, locals, men, who, have, sex, with, only, women, and, men, who, have, sex, with, women, and, men, were, not, differentiated, little, is, known, about, same, sex, attracted, females, or, sexual, behavior, between, females, in, these, cultures, in, the, united, states, non, caucasian, lgbt, individuals, may, find, themselves, in, a, double, minority, where, they, are, neither, fully, accepted, or, understood, by, mainly, caucasian, lgbt, communities, nor, are, they, accepted, by, their, own, ethnic, group, many, people, experience, racism, in, the, dominant, lgbt, community, where, racial, stereotypes, merge, with, gender, stereotypes, such, that, asian, american, lgbts, are, viewed, as, more, passive, and, feminine, while, african, american, lgbts, are, viewed, as, more, masculine, and, aggressive, there, are, a, number, of, culturally, specific, support, networks, for, lgbt, individuals, active, in, the, united, states, for, example, m, i, for, vietnamese, american, queer, females, sexuality, in, the, context, of, religion, is, often, a, controversial, subject, especially, that, of, sexual, orientation, in, the, past, various, sects, have, viewed, homosexuality, from, a, negative, point, of, view, and, had, punishments, for, same, sex, relationships, in, modern, times, an, increasing, number, of, religions, and, religious, denominations, accept, homosexuality, it, is, possible, to, integrate, sexual, identity, and, religious, identity, depending, on, the, interpretation, of, religious, texts, some, religious, organizations, object, to, the, concept, of, sexual, orientation, entirely, in, the, 2014, revision, of, the, code, of, ethics, of, the, american, association, of, christian, counselors, members, are, forbidden, to, describe, or, reduce, human, identity, and, nature, to, sexual, orientation, or, reference, even, while, counselors, must, acknowledge, the, client, s, fundamental, right, to, self, determination, the, internet, has, influenced, sexual, orientation, in, two, ways, it, is, a, common, mode, of, discourse, on, the, subject, of, sexual, orientation, and, sexual, identity, and, therefore, shapes, popular, conceptions, and, it, allows, anonymous, attainment, of, sexual, partners, as, well, as, facilitates, communication, and, connection, between, greater, numbers, of, people, modern, scientific, surveys, find, that, across, cultures, most, people, report, a, heterosexual, orientation, 8, 9, 10, bisexuality, comes, in, varying, degrees, of, relative, attraction, to, the, same, or, opposite, sex, 8, 9, men, are, more, likely, to, be, exclusively, homosexual, than, to, be, equally, attracted, to, both, sexes, while, the, opposite, is, true, for, women, 8, 9, surveys, in, western, cultures, find, on, average, that, about, 93, of, men, and, 87, of, women, identify, as, completely, heterosexual, 4, of, men, and, 10, of, women, as, mostly, heterosexual, 0, 5, of, men, and, 1, of, women, as, evenly, bisexual, 0, 5, of, men, and, 0, 5, of, women, as, mostly, homosexual, and, 2, of, men, and, 0, 5, of, women, as, completely, homosexual, an, analysis, of, 67, studies, found, that, the, lifetime, prevalence, of, sex, between, men, regardless, of, orientation, was, 3, 5, for, east, asia, 6, 12, for, south, and, south, east, asia, 6, 15, for, eastern, europe, and, 6, 20, for, latin, america, the, international, hiv, aids, alliance, estimates, a, worldwide, prevalence, of, men, who, have, sex, with, men, between, 3, and, 16, the, relative, percentage, of, the, population, that, reports, a, homosexual, or, bisexual, orientation, can, vary, with, different, methodologies, and, selection, criteria, a, 1998, report, stated, that, these, statistical, findings, are, in, the, range, of, 2, 8, to, 9, for, males, and, 1, to, 5, for, females, for, the, united, states, this, figure, can, be, as, high, as, 12, for, some, large, cities, and, as, low, as, 1, for, rural, areas, a, small, percentage, of, people, are, not, sexually, attracted, to, anyone, asexuality, a, study, in, 2004, placed, the, prevalence, of, asexuality, at, 1, in, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, male, 1948, and, sexual, behavior, in, the, human, female, 1953, by, alfred, c, kinsey, et, al, people, were, asked, to, rate, themselves, on, a, scale, from, completely, heterosexual, to, completely, homosexual, kinsey, reported, that, when, the, individuals, behavior, as, well, as, their, identity, are, analyzed, a, significant, number, of, people, appeared, to, be, at, least, somewhat, bisexual, i, e, they, have, some, attraction, to, either, sex, although, usually, one, sex, is, preferred, kinsey, s, methods, have, been, criticized, as, flawed, particularly, with, regard, to, the, randomness, of, his, sample, population, which, included, prison, inmates, male, prostitutes, and, those, who, willingly, participated, in, discussion, of, previously, taboo, sexual, topics, nevertheless, paul, gebhard, subsequent, director, of, the, kinsey, institute, for, sex, research, reexamined, the, data, in, the, kinsey, reports, and, concluded, that, removing, the, prison, inmates, and, prostitutes, barely, affected, the, results, more, recent, researchers, believe, that, kinsey, overestimated, the, rate, of, same, sex, attraction, because, of, flaws, in, his, sampling, methods, 9, 147, because, sexual, orientation, is, complex, some, academics, and, researchers, especially, in, queer, studies, have, argued, that, it, is, a, historical, and, social, construction, in, 1976, philosopher, and, historian, michel, foucault, argued, in, the, history, of, sexuality, that, homosexuality, as, an, identity, did, not, exist, in, the, eighteenth, century, that, people, instead, spoke, of, sodomy, which, referred, to, sexual, acts, sodomy, was, a, crime, that, was, often, ignored, but, sometimes, punished, severely, under, sodomy, laws, he, wrote, sexuality, is, an, invention, of, the, modern, state, the, industrial, revolution, and, capitalism, other, scholars, argue, that, there, are, significant, continuities, between, ancient, and, modern, homosexuality, the, philosopher, of, science, michael, ruse, has, stated, that, the, social, constructionist, approach, which, is, influenced, by, foucault, is, based, on, a, selective, reading, of, the, historical, record, that, confuses, the, existence, of, homosexual, people, with, the, way, in, which, they, are, labelled, or, treated, in, much, of, the, modern, world, sexual, identity, is, defined, based, on, the, sex, of, one, s, partner, in, some, parts, of, the, world, however, sexuality, is, often, socially, defined, based, on, sexual, roles, whether, one, is, a, penetrator, or, is, penetrated, in, western, cultures, people, speak, meaningfully, of, gay, lesbian, and, bisexual, identities, and, communities, in, some, other, cultures, homosexuality, and, heterosexual, labels, do, not, emphasize, an, entire, social, identity, or, indicate, community, affiliation, based, on, sexual, orientation, some, historians, and, researchers, argue, that, the, emotional, and, affectionate, activities, associated, with, sexual, orientation, terms, such, as, gay, and, heterosexual, change, significantly, over, time, and, across, cultural, boundaries, for, example, in, many, english, speaking, nations, it, is, assumed, that, same, sex, kissing, particularly, between, men, is, a, sign, of, homosexuality, whereas, various, types, of, same, sex, kissing, are, common, expressions, of, friendship, in, other, nations, also, many, modern, and, historic, cultures, have, formal, ceremonies, expressing, long, term, commitment, between, same, sex, friends, even, though, homosexuality, itself, is, taboo, within, the, cultures, professor, michael, king, stated, the, conclusion, reached, by, scientists, who, have, investigated, the, origins, and, stability, of, sexual, orientation, is, that, it, is, a, human, characteristic, that, is, formed, early, in, life, and, is, resistant, to, change, scientific, evidence, on, the, origins, of, homosexuality, is, considered, relevant, to, theological, and, social, debate, because, it, undermines, suggestions, that, sexual, orientation, is, a, choice, in, 1999, law, professor, david, cruz, wrote, that, sexual, orientation, and, the, related, concept, homosexuality, might, plausibly, refer, to, a, variety, of, different, attributes, singly, or, in, combination, what, is, not, immediately, clear, is, whether, one, conception, is, most, suited, to, all, social, legal, and, constitutional, purposes
