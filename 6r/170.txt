cohabitation, is, an, arrangement, where, people, who, are, not, married, usually, couples, live, together, they, are, often, involved, in, a, romantic, or, sexually, intimate, relationship, on, a, long, term, or, permanent, basis, such, arrangements, have, become, increasingly, common, in, western, countries, since, the, late, 20th, century, being, led, by, changing, social, views, especially, regarding, marriage, more, broadly, the, term, cohabitation, can, mean, any, number, of, people, living, together, to, cohabit, in, a, broad, sense, means, to, coexist, the, origin, of, the, term, comes, from, the, mid, 16th, century, from, the, latin, cohabitare, from, co, together, habitare, dwell, today, cohabitation, is, a, common, pattern, among, people, in, the, western, world, in, europe, the, scandinavian, countries, have, been, the, first, to, start, this, leading, trend, although, many, countries, have, since, followed, mediterranean, europe, has, traditionally, been, very, conservative, with, religion, playing, a, strong, role, until, the, mid, 1990s, cohabitation, levels, remained, low, in, this, region, but, have, since, increased, for, example, in, portugal, the, majority, of, children, have, been, born, of, unwed, parents, since, 2015, constituting, 60, of, the, total, in, 2021, in, the, united, states, during, the, past, few, decades, there, has, been, an, increase, in, unmarried, couples, cohabiting, historically, many, western, countries, have, been, influenced, by, christian, doctrines, on, sex, which, opposes, unmarried, cohabitation, as, social, norms, have, changed, such, beliefs, have, become, less, widely, held, by, the, population, and, some, christian, denominations, today, view, cohabitation, as, a, precursor, to, marriage, pope, francis, has, married, a, cohabiting, couple, who, had, children, while, former, archbishop, of, canterbury, rowan, williams, and, the, archbishop, of, york, john, sentamu, have, expressed, tolerance, of, cohabitation, in, recent, decades, high, rates, of, participation, of, women, in, the, workforce, and, the, widespread, availability, of, highly, effective, long, acting, reversible, contraceptives, has, led, to, women, making, individual, choices, over, their, reproduction, with, decreased, reliance, on, male, partners, for, financial, stability, all, these, changes, favored, living, arrangement, alternatives, to, marriage, in, central, and, eastern, europe, during, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, there, were, major, political, changes, such, as, the, fall, of, communist, governments, these, societies, entered, a, new, era, of, increased, social, freedom, less, rigid, rules, and, less, authoritarian, governments, they, interacted, with, western, europe, and, some, became, members, of, the, european, union, as, a, result, the, patterns, of, family, life, have, started, to, change, marriage, rates, have, declined, and, marriage, was, postponed, to, a, later, age, cohabitation, and, births, to, unmarried, mothers, increased, and, in, some, countries, the, increase, was, very, quick, the, deinstitutionalization, of, marriage, refers, to, the, weakening, of, the, social, and, legal, norms, that, regulate, peoples, behavior, in, regard, to, marriage, the, rise, in, cohabitation, is, part, of, other, major, social, changes, such, as, higher, divorce, rate, older, age, at, first, marriage, and, childbearing, and, more, births, outside, marriage, factors, such, as, secularization, increased, participation, of, women, in, the, labor, force, changing, in, the, meaning, of, marriage, risk, reduction, individualism, and, changing, views, on, sexuality, have, been, cited, as, contributing, to, these, social, changes, there, has, also, been, a, change, in, modern, sexual, ethics, with, a, focus, on, consent, rather, than, marital, status, i, e, decriminalization, of, adultery, and, fornication, criminalization, of, marital, rape, reflecting, new, concepts, about, the, role, and, purpose, of, sexual, interaction, and, new, conceptualizations, of, female, sexuality, and, of, self, determination, there, have, been, objections, against, the, legal, and, social, regulation, of, female, sexuality, with, such, regulations, being, often, seen, as, violations, of, women, s, rights, in, addition, some, individuals, may, feel, that, marriage, is, unnecessary, or, outdated, leading, to, couples, not, formalizing, their, relation, for, instance, in, the, european, values, study, evs, of, 2008, the, percentage, of, respondents, who, agreed, with, the, assertion, that, marriage, is, an, outdated, institution, was, 37, 5, in, luxembourg, 35, 4, in, france, 34, 3, in, belgium, 31, 2, in, spain, 30, 5, in, austria, 29, 2, in, germany, 27, 7, in, switzerland, 27, 2, in, bulgaria, 27, 0, in, the, netherlands, 25, 0, in, slovenia, the, fact, that, many, couples, choose, to, live, together, without, formalizing, their, relation, is, also, recognized, by, the, european, union, a, 2004, directive, forbids, eu, members, from, denying, entry, or, residence, of, partners, with, whom, the, union, citizen, has, a, durable, relationship, duly, attested, today, cohabitation, in, the, united, states, is, often, a, part, of, the, dating, process, in, fact, cohabitation, is, increasingly, becoming, the, first, coresidential, union, formed, among, young, adults, in, 1996, more, than, two, thirds, of, married, couples, in, the, us, said, that, they, lived, together, before, getting, married, in, 1994, there, were, 3, 7, million, cohabiting, couples, in, the, united, states, this, is, a, major, increase, from, a, few, decades, ago, according, to, dr, galena, rhoades, before, 1970, living, together, outside, marriage, was, uncommon, but, by, the, late, 1990s, at, least, 50, to, 60, of, couples, lived, together, premaritally, people, may, live, together, for, a, number, of, reasons, cohabitants, could, live, together, to, save, money, because, of, the, convenience, of, living, with, another, or, a, need, to, find, housing, lower, income, individuals, facing, financial, uncertainty, may, delay, or, avoid, marriage, not, only, because, of, the, difficulty, of, paying, for, a, wedding, but, also, because, of, fear, of, financial, hardship, if, a, marriage, were, to, end, in, divorce, when, given, a, survey, of, the, reasons, why, they, cohabit, most, couples, listed, reasons, such, as, spending, more, time, together, convenience, based, reasons, and, testing, their, relationships, while, few, gave, the, reason, that, they, do, not, believe, in, marriage, the, extremely, high, costs, of, housing, and, tight, budgets, of, today, s, economy, are, also, factors, that, can, lead, a, couple, to, cohabitation, today, sixty, percent, of, all, marriages, are, preceded, by, a, period, of, cohabitation, researchers, suggest, that, couples, live, together, as, a, way, of, trying, out, marriage, to, test, compatibility, with, their, partners, while, still, having, the, option, of, ending, the, relationship, without, legal, implications, in, 1996, more, than, three, quarters, of, all, cohabitors, report, plans, to, marry, their, partners, which, implies, that, most, of, them, viewed, cohabitation, as, a, prelude, to, marriage, cohabitation, shares, many, qualities, with, marriage, often, couples, who, are, cohabiting, share, a, residence, personal, resources, exclude, intimate, relations, with, others, and, in, more, than, 10, of, cohabiting, couples, have, children, many, young, adults, believe, cohabitation, is, a, good, way, to, test, their, relationships, prior, to, marriage, couples, who, have, plans, to, marry, before, moving, in, together, or, who, are, engaged, before, cohabiting, typically, marry, within, two, years, of, living, together, the, state, of, cohabitation, of, a, couple, often, ends, either, in, marriage, or, in, break, up, according, to, a, 1996, study, about, 10, of, cohabiting, unions, remained, in, this, state, more, than, five, years, according, to, a, survey, done, by, the, national, center, for, health, statistics, over, half, of, marriages, from, 1990, 1994, among, women, began, as, cohabitation, cohabitation, can, be, an, alternative, to, marriage, in, situations, where, marriage, is, not, possible, for, legal, or, religious, reasons, such, as, same, sex, interracial, or, interreligious, marriages, cohabitation, sometimes, called, de, facto, marriage, is, becoming, more, commonly, known, as, a, substitute, for, conventional, marriage, common, law, marriage, in, the, united, states, can, still, be, contracted, in, nine, us, states, and, in, two, others, under, restriction, this, helps, provide, the, surviving, partner, a, legal, basis, for, inheriting, the, decedent, s, belongings, in, the, event, of, the, death, of, their, cohabiting, partner, in, today, s, cohabiting, relationships, forty, percent, of, households, include, children, giving, an, idea, of, how, cohabitation, could, be, considered, a, new, normative, type, of, family, dynamic, in, 2012, 41, of, all, births, in, the, us, were, to, unmarried, women, in, three, states, mississippi, 55, louisiana, 53, and, new, mexico, 52, births, outside, marriage, were, in, the, majority, the, lowest, percentage, of, births, outside, marriage, was, in, utah, at, 19, during, the, period, 2006, 2010, 58, of, births, outside, marriage, were, to, cohabiting, parents, contemporary, objections, to, cohabiting, couples, include, religious, opposition, to, non, marital, unions, social, pressure, for, couples, to, get, married, and, potential, effects, of, cohabitation, on, a, child, s, development, the, rise, in, the, number, of, cohabiting, couples, and, children, born, out, of, wedlock, in, the, western, world, has, made, cohabitation, a, strong, focus, of, sociological, research, the, rise, in, cohabiting, couples, in, the, united, states, from, around, 450, 000, in, 1960, to, 7, 5, million, in, 2011, has, been, accompanied, by, us, research, performed, on, child, development, within, cohabiting, households, opponents, of, cohabitation, say, non, marital, parenting, is, an, unsuitable, environment, for, a, child, s, development, one, study, from, 2002, correlated, lower, numeracy, skills, and, higher, delinquency, to, children, of, cohabiting, couples, however, recent, studies, that, control, for, factors, including, poverty, the, educational, level, of, parents, and, violence, in, the, home, show, children, of, cohabiting, couples, are, developmentally, similar, to, peers, of, comparable, married, couples, in, 2001, researchers, compared, teenage, children, in, the, united, states, living, in, a, cohabiting, household, a, single, mother, and, her, boyfriend, who, was, not, related, to, the, teenager, against, peers, in, single, parent, households, the, results, showed, white, and, hispanic, teenagers, had, lower, performance, in, school, greater, risk, of, suspension, or, expulsion, than, peers, from, single, parent, households, and, the, same, rate, of, behavioral, and, emotional, problems, a, study, on, the, 1995, and, 2002, national, survey, of, family, growth, found, increases, in, both, the, prevalence, and, duration, of, unmarried, cohabitation, the, study, found, that, 40, of, children, in, the, united, states, would, live, in, a, cohabiting, household, by, age, 12, and, children, born, to, single, mothers, were, more, likely, than, those, born, to, married, mothers, to, live, in, a, cohabiting, household, the, percentage, of, women, ages, 19, 44, who, had, ever, cohabited, increased, from, 45, in, 1995, to, 54, in, 2002, in, 2002, 63, of, women, who, graduate, from, high, school, were, found, to, spend, some, time, cohabiting, compared, to, only, 45, of, women, with, a, four, year, college, degree, cohabiting, couples, who, have, children, often, get, married, one, study, found, that, children, born, of, parents, who, cohabit, are, 90, more, likely, to, end, up, living, in, households, with, married, parents, than, children, born, to, single, mothers, 67, of, unmarried, hispanic, mothers, are, expected, to, marry, while, 40, of, african, american, mothers, are, expected, to, marry, studies, have, found, that, religious, affiliation, correlates, with, cohabitation, and, marriage, entry, people, frequently, cite, religious, reasons, for, their, opposition, to, cohabitation, the, roman, catholic, church, and, nearly, all, mainstream, protestant, denominations, around, the, world, oppose, cohabitation, and, consider, it, to, be, the, sin, of, fornication, however, others, such, as, the, church, of, england, welcome, cohabiting, couples, in, the, church, and, encourage, them, to, regard, cohabitation, as, a, prelude, to, christian, marriage, religion, can, also, lead, to, societal, pressures, against, cohabitation, especially, within, highly, religious, communities, some, couples, may, refrain, from, cohabitation, because, one, or, both, partners, fear, disappointing, or, alienating, conservative, family, members, young, adults, who, grew, up, in, families, that, oppose, cohabitation, have, lower, rates, than, their, peers, the, increase, in, cohabitation, in, the, united, states, and, other, developed, nations, has, been, linked, to, the, secularization, of, those, countries, researchers, have, noted, that, changes, in, the, religious, demographics, of, a, society, have, accompanied, the, rise, in, cohabitation, non, marital, and, same, sex, relationships, are, forbidden, by, the, islamic, law, of, zina, and, cohabitation, is, against, the, law, in, many, muslim, majority, countries, including, saudi, arabia, pakistan, afghanistan, iran, kuwait, maldives, morocco, oman, mauritania, united, arab, emirates, sudan, and, yemen, conflicting, studies, on, the, effect, of, cohabitation, on, subsequent, marriage, have, been, published, in, countries, where, the, majority, of, people, disapprove, of, unmarried, individuals, living, together, or, a, minority, of, the, population, cohabits, before, marriage, marriages, resulting, from, cohabitation, are, more, prone, to, divorce, but, in, a, study, on, european, countries, those, where, around, half, of, the, population, cohabits, before, marriage, cohabitation, is, not, selective, of, divorce, prone, individuals, and, no, difference, in, couples, that, have, cohabited, before, and, after, marriage, is, observed, in, countries, such, as, italy, the, increased, risk, of, marital, disruption, for, people, who, experienced, premarital, cohabitation, can, be, entirely, attributed, to, the, selection, of, the, most, divorce, prone, into, cohabitation, in, 2002, the, cdc, found, that, for, married, couples, the, likelihood, percentage, of, the, relationship, ending, after, five, years, is, 20, for, unmarried, cohabitators, the, likelihood, percentage, is, 49, after, 10, years, the, likelihood, percentage, for, the, relationship, to, end, is, 33, for, married, couples, and, 62, for, unmarried, cohabitators, one, german, study, found, that, in, regions, with, high, rates, of, childbirth, to, cohabitating, parents, no, negative, effect, is, observed, in, cohabitation, the, study, states, union, stability, of, cohabiting, mothers, is, positively, related, to, their, prevalence, a, 2004, study, of, 136, couples, 272, individuals, from, researchers, at, the, university, of, denver, found, differences, among, couples, that, cohabited, before, engagement, after, engagement, or, not, until, marriage, the, longitudinal, study, collected, survey, data, before, marriage, and, 10, months, into, marriage, with, findings, suggesting, those, who, cohabit, before, engagement, are, at, greater, risk, for, poor, marital, outcomes, than, those, who, cohabit, only, after, engagement, or, at, marriage, a, follow, up, survey, by, the, researches, of, over, 1, 000, married, men, and, women, married, in, the, past, 10, years, found, those, who, moved, in, with, a, lover, before, engagement, or, marriage, reported, significantly, lower, quality, marriages, and, a, greater, possibility, of, a, separation, than, other, couples, about, 20, of, those, who, cohabited, before, getting, engaged, had, since, suggested, splitting, compared, with, only, 12, of, those, who, only, moved, in, together, after, getting, engaged, and, 10, who, did, not, cohabit, prior, to, marriage, another, 2004, study, of, 92, couples, linked, communication, to, cohabitation, and, instability, they, found, that, married, couples, who, cohabited, before, they, were, married, had, more, negative, problem, solving, and, communication, skills, they, also, found, that, those, who, had, cohabited, expressed, more, verbal, aggression, throughout, their, conversations, this, negative, communication, could, be, contributing, to, the, cohabitation, effect, and, causing, a, larger, amount, of, marital, instability, the, researchers, from, denver, suggest, that, relationships, with, pre, engagement, cohabitation, may, wind, up, sliding, into, marriage, whereas, those, that, only, cohabit, post, engagement, or, marriage, make, a, more, clear, decision, this, could, explain, their, 2006, study, of, 197, heterosexual, couples, finding, that, men, who, cohabited, with, their, spouse, before, engagement, were, less, dedicated, than, men, who, cohabited, only, after, engagement, or, not, at, all, before, marriage, in, some, heterosexual, couples, women, are, more, likely, to, understand, cohabitation, as, an, intermediary, step, preceding, marriage, and, men, more, likely, to, perceive, it, without, an, explicit, connection, to, marriage, an, analysis, of, data, from, the, cdc, s, national, survey, of, family, growth, data, from, 1988, 1995, and, 2002, suggests, that, the, positive, relationship, between, premarital, cohabitation, and, marital, instability, has, weakened, for, more, recent, birth, and, marriage, cohorts, as, the, total, number, of, couples, cohabiting, before, marriage, has, increased, later, cdc, work, found, that, between, 2002, and, 2006, 2010, the, number, of, couples, in, opposite, sex, cohabiting, relationships, increased, from, 9, 0, to, 11, 2, for, women, and, from, 9, 2, to, 12, 2, for, men, drawing, on, the, 2006, 2008, data, princeton, university, researchers, examined, whether, and, to, what, extent, variation, in, premarital, cohabitation, experiences, influence, marital, stability, they, found, that, the, relationship, between, cohabitation, and, marital, instability, is, complex, and, depends, in, part, on, marriage, cohort, race, ethnicity, and, marriage, plans, their, analyses, reveal, that, a, cohabitation, effect, exists, only, for, women, married, prior, to, 1996, and, that, until, marriage, plans, are, considered, there, is, no, cohabitation, effect, among, women, married, since, 1996, recent, research, from, 2011, by, the, pew, research, center, has, found, that, the, number, of, couples, that, cohabit, before, marriage, has, increased, 44, of, adults, and, more, than, half, of, 30, to, 49, year, olds, say, they, have, cohabited, at, some, point, nearly, two, thirds, of, adults, who, ever, cohabited, 64, say, they, thought, about, it, as, a, step, toward, marriage, the, report, also, notes, a, trend, toward, rising, public, acceptance, of, cohabiting, couples, over, the, years, most, americans, now, say, the, rise, in, unmarried, couples, living, together, either, makes, no, difference, to, society, 46, or, is, good, for, society, 9, a, 2012, study, found, that, among, cohabiting, individuals, those, who, were, engaged, prior, to, cohabitation, or, had, definite, plans, for, marriage, were, linked, to, lower, risks, of, marital, instability, among, women, but, the, relationship, was, not, observed, with, men, one, study, on, low, to, moderate, income, couples, living, with, minor, children, found, that, respondents, who, became, sexually, involved, within, the, first, month, of, their, relationship, were, correlated, to, lower, scores, of, relationship, quality, among, women, another, study, found, respondents, to, a, mail, in, survey, self, reported, higher, levels, of, commitment, in, the, cohabiting, group, as, well, as, lower, relationship, satisfaction, and, more, negative, communication, a, 2018, study, found, that, cohabiting, before, marriage, was, linked, to, a, lower, risk, of, divorce, during, the, first, year, of, marriage, but, a, greater, risk, of, divorce, in, the, long, run, however, a, report, published, by, the, council, on, contemporary, families, that, same, year, found, that, couples, who, cohabited, before, marriage, were, less, likely, to, divorce, than, couples, who, did, not, university, of, chicago, sociologist, linda, waite, found, that, 16, percent, of, cohabiting, women, reported, that, arguments, with, their, partners, became, physical, during, the, past, year, while, only, 5, percent, of, married, women, had, similar, experiences, most, cohabiting, couples, have, a, faithful, relationship, but, waite, s, surveys, also, demonstrated, that, 20, of, cohabiting, women, reported, having, secondary, sex, partners, compared, to, only, 4, of, married, women, according, to, an, article, by, judith, treas, and, deirdre, giesen, cohabiting, couples, are, twice, as, likely, to, experience, infidelity, within, the, relationship, than, married, couples, regarding, cohabitation, as, a, fertility, factor, a, large, survey, in, the, united, states, came, to, the, result, that, married, women, had, an, average, of, 1, 9, children, compared, to, 1, 3, among, those, cohabiting, the, corresponding, numbers, for, men, were, 1, 7, and, 1, 1, respectively, the, difference, of, 0, 6, children, for, both, sexes, was, expected, to, decrease, to, between, 0, 2, and, 0, 3, over, the, lifetime, when, correcting, for, the, confounder, that, married, people, have, their, children, earlier, in, life, a, study, of, the, united, states, and, multiple, countries, in, europe, came, to, the, result, that, women, who, continue, to, cohabit, after, birth, have, significantly, lower, probability, of, having, a, second, child, than, married, women, in, all, countries, except, those, in, eastern, europe, another, study, on, the, contrary, came, to, the, result, that, cohabiting, couples, in, france, have, equal, fertility, as, married, ones, also, russians, have, a, higher, fertility, within, cohabitation, while, romanians, rather, tend, to, have, childless, marriages, survey, data, from, 2003, in, romania, came, to, the, result, that, marriage, equalized, the, total, fertility, rate, among, both, highly, educated, and, low, educated, people, to, approximately, 1, 4, among, those, cohabiting, on, the, other, hand, lower, level, of, education, increased, fertility, rate, to, 1, 7, and, a, higher, level, of, education, decreased, it, to, 0, 7, on, the, other, hand, another, study, came, to, the, result, that, romanian, women, with, little, education, have, about, equal, fertility, in, marital, and, cohabiting, partnerships, in, the, united, states, married, couples, that, submit, a, combined, tax, return, may, face, a, marriage, penalty, where, tax, credits, for, low, income, single, earners, are, not, applied, to, the, combined, income, in, october, 1998, senate, gop, leader, trent, lott, decided, to, pull, a, bill, to, abolish, the, marriage, penalty, which, in, the, tax, code, reflects, the, fact, that, married, couples, who, both, work, for, wages, frequently, pay, more, in, taxes, than, if, they, earned, the, same, amount, of, income, but, weren, t, married, and, the, more, equal, the, incomes, of, the, couple, the, steeper, the, marriage, tax, penalty, the, earned, income, tax, credit, eitc, is, cash, welfare, for, low, income, workers, but, the, problem, is, the, eitc, is, not, for, married, couples, because, they, have, to, combine, their, wages, which, again, leads, to, the, marriage, penalty, if, couples, do, not, get, married, then, their, wages, do, not, have, to, combine, and, the, eitc, in, a, way, is, paying, for, low, income, couples, not, to, marry, opponents, of, cohabitation, believe, that, some, cohabiting, couples, choose, not, to, marry, because, they, would, suffer, a, tax, penalty, despite, the, perceived, disincentive, to, marry, that, the, eitc, provides, cohabiting, couples, suffer, many, financial, losses, as, their, unions, are, not, recognized, with, the, same, legal, and, financial, benefits, as, those, who, are, legally, married, these, financial, penalties, can, include, the, costs, of, separate, insurance, policies, and, the, costs, of, setting, up, legal, protections, similar, to, those, that, are, automatically, granted, by, the, state, upon, marriage, a, conflicting, study, published, by, the, national, center, for, health, statistics, with, a, sample, of, 12, 571, people, concludes, that, those, who, live, together, after, making, plans, to, marry, or, getting, engaged, have, about, the, same, chances, of, divorcing, as, couples, who, never, cohabited, before, marriage, additionally, william, doherty, a, professor, in, the, department, of, family, social, science, at, the, university, of, minnesota, has, remarked, that, in, his, research, he, has, found, that, committed, cohabiting, relationships, seem, to, confer, many, of, the, benefits, of, marriage, a, 2003, study, by, the, australian, institute, of, family, studies, found, that, the, differences, in, measured, outcomes, for, those, from, direct, and, indirect, marriages, appear, to, be, entirely, attributable, to, other, factors, the, study, concluded, that, the, evidence, suggests, that, premarital, cohabitation, has, little, impact, one, way, or, the, other, on, the, chances, of, any, subsequent, marriage, surviving, canadian, laws, on, the, recognition, of, unmarried, cohabitation, for, legal, purposes, vary, significantly, by, province, territory, and, in, addition, to, this, federal, regulations, also, have, an, impact, across, the, country, see, common, law, marriage, canada, family, formation, has, undergone, significant, changes, in, canada, during, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, but, the, patterns, vary, widely, across, the, country, suggesting, differing, cultural, norms, in, different, regions, from, 1995, births, to, cohabiting, parents, have, increased, particularly, in, quebec, in, canada, it, is, difficult, to, obtain, exact, data, on, the, percentage, of, births, outside, marriage, because, data, on, the, marital, status, of, mothers, is, collected, differently, across, the, provinces, and, territories, of, canada, and, in, some, such, as, alberta, it, is, not, broken, down, in, detail, in, regard, to, whether, the, mother, was, legally, married, or, not, at, the, birth, of, her, child, as, of, 2012, the, statistical, category, of, single, mothers, defined, as, never, married, at, the, time, of, the, birth, encompassed, 28, 3, of, mothers, the, category, divorced, i, e, mothers, who, were, unmarried, at, the, time, of, birth, but, had, been, previously, married, during, their, lives, encompassed, 1, while, for, 10, of, mothers, the, marital, status, was, unknown, not, stated, there, are, however, very, significant, differences, by, province, territory, for, example, in, 2012, 77, 8, of, births, in, nunavut, were, listed, to, single, mothers, by, contrast, less, than, 20, of, mothers, in, ontario, were, listed, in, this, category, latest, data, from, the, quebec, statistical, institute, shows, that, as, of, 2015, in, quebec, 63, of, children, were, born, to, unmarried, women, in, canada, legal, issues, regarding, cohabitation, are, very, complicated, by, the, fact, that, family, law, in, this, regard, differs, by, province, territory, which, is, very, confusing, to, the, public, especially, as, this, contrasts, to, criminal, law, which, is, the, same, across, canada, as, well, as, to, marriage, and, divorce, law, which, is, also, the, same, across, the, country, under, the, 1986, divorce, act, canada, although, provinces, territories, have, jurisdiction, over, some, marital, issues, including, the, solemnization, of, marriage, spousal, and, child, support, and, property, division, the, marital, status, of, canadians, also, varies, by, province, territory, in, 2011, 46, 4, of, the, population, aged, 15, and, over, was, legally, married, ranging, from, the, lowest, percentage, of, married, people, being, in, nunavut, 29, 7, northwest, territories, 35, 0, quebec, 35, 4, and, yukon, 37, 6, to, highest, being, in, newfoundland, and, labrador, 52, 9, prince, edward, island, 51, 7, ontario, 50, 3, and, alberta, 50, 2, while, today, quebec, is, known, for, liberal, family, formation, and, cohabitation, this, is, a, recent, development, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, family, life, in, the, province, was, conservative, and, strongly, dominated, by, roman, catholicism, before, 1968, there, was, no, provincial, divorce, legislation, in, quebec, and, spouses, could, only, end, their, marriage, if, they, obtained, a, private, act, of, parliament, one, of, the, explanations, of, the, current, high, rates, of, cohabitation, in, quebec, is, that, the, traditionally, strong, social, control, of, the, church, and, the, catholic, doctrine, over, people, s, private, relations, and, sexual, morality, has, led, the, population, to, rebel, against, traditional, and, conservative, social, values, while, some, provinces, were, early, to, modernize, family, law, in, others, this, only, happened, in, the, 1990s, and, the, 21st, century, such, as, in, alberta, through, the, family, law, act, alberta, which, came, into, force, in, 2005, this, act, overhauled, family, legislation, replacing, the, domestic, relations, act, the, maintenance, order, act, the, parentage, and, maintenance, act, and, parts, of, the, provincial, court, act, and, the, child, youth, and, family, enhancement, act, which, were, seen, as, outdated, also, the, adult, interdependent, relationships, act, s, a, 2002, c, a, 4, 5, amended, 69, alberta, laws, the, canadian, prairies, provinces, of, manitoba, and, saskatchewan, have, strong, common, law, spouses, regulations, imposing, rights, and, obligations, on, common, law, couples, nova, scotia, has, also, been, very, slow, to, advance, family, law, it, was, only, in, 1999, that, this, province, abolished, discrimination, against, illegitimate, children, with, regard, to, inheritance, through, section, 16, of, ns, intestate, succession, act, amended, in, 1999, in, general, today, provinces, in, western, canada, give, more, rights, to, common, law, spouses, than, those, in, atlantic, canada, and, in, quebec, this, may, seem, quite, paradoxical, because, it, is, the, eastern, provinces, which, have, the, strongest, tradition, of, cohabitation, according, to, a, study, unmarried, cohabitation, seems, to, be, more, common, in, eastern, canada, than, in, western, canada, which, might, be, related, to, internal, and, international, migration, as, of, 2012, 48, of, births, in, new, brunswick, 47, 1, in, newfoundland, and, labrador, and, 45, 2, in, nova, scotia, were, listed, to, single, mothers, way, above, the, national, average, in, british, columbia, the, family, law, act, came, into, force, in, 2013, cohabitation, in, the, united, states, became, common, in, the, late, 20th, century, as, of, 2005, 4, 85, million, unmarried, couples, were, living, together, and, as, of, 2002, about, half, of, all, women, aged, 15, to, 44, had, lived, unmarried, with, a, partner, in, 2007, it, is, estimated, that, 6, 4, million, households, were, maintained, by, two, opposite, sex, persons, who, said, they, were, unmarried, in, 2012, the, general, social, survey, found, that, public, disapproval, of, cohabitation, had, dropped, to, 20, of, the, population, researchers, at, the, national, center, for, family, and, marriage, research, estimated, in, 2011, that, 66, of, first, marriages, are, entered, after, a, period, of, cohabitation, according, to, the, 2009, american, community, survey, conducted, by, the, census, bureau, the, proportion, of, 30, to, 44, year, olds, living, together, has, almost, doubled, since, 1999, from, 4, to, 7, fifty, eight, percent, of, women, aged, 19, to, 44, had, ever, cohabited, in, data, collected, in, 2006, 08, while, in, 1987, only, 33, had, cohabitation, is, more, prevalent, among, those, with, less, education, among, women, ages, 19, to, 44, 73, of, those, without, a, high, school, education, have, ever, cohabited, compared, with, about, half, of, women, with, some, college, 52, or, a, college, degree, 47, note, the, pew, study, s, authors, richard, fry, and, d, vera, cohn, before, the, mid, 20th, century, laws, against, cohabitation, fornication, adultery, and, other, such, behaviors, were, common, in, the, us, especially, in, southern, and, northeastern, states, but, these, laws, have, been, gradually, abolished, or, struck, down, by, courts, as, unconstitutional, cohabitation, was, almost, impossible, in, the, united, states, prior, to, the, 1960s, laws, prevented, unmarried, couples, from, registering, in, hotels, and, it, was, very, difficult, for, an, unmarried, couple, to, obtain, a, home, mortgage, from, 1960, to, 1998, cohabitation, moved, from, disreputable, and, difficult, to, normal, and, convenient, as, of, december, 2023, cohabitation, of, unmarried, couples, remains, illegal, in, two, states, mississippi, and, north, carolina, while, as, of, 2023, fornication, remains, illegal, in, two, states, georgia, and, south, carolina, these, laws, are, almost, never, enforced, and, are, now, believed, to, be, unconstitutional, since, the, legal, decision, lawrence, v, texas, in, 2003, however, these, laws, may, have, indirect, effects, for, example, one, consequence, may, be, that, one, may, not, claim, their, partner, as, a, dependent, for, a, tax, exemption, whereas, in, the, other, states, it, may, be, possible, to, do, so, after, meeting, four, criteria, residency, income, support, and, status, in, 2006, in, north, carolina, pender, county, superior, court, judge, benjamin, g, alford, ruled, that, north, carolina, s, cohabitation, law, is, unconstitutional, however, the, supreme, court, of, north, carolina, has, never, had, the, opportunity, to, rule, on, it, so, the, law, s, statewide, constitutionality, remains, unclear, on, 13, december, 2013, us, federal, judge, clark, waddoups, ruled, in, brown, v, buhman, that, the, portions, of, utah, s, anti, polygamy, laws, which, prohibit, multiple, cohabitation, were, unconstitutional, but, also, allowed, utah, to, maintain, its, ban, on, multiple, marriage, licenses, this, decision, was, overturned, by, the, united, states, court, of, appeals, for, the, tenth, circuit, thus, effectively, recriminalizing, polygamy, as, a, felony, in, 2020, utah, voted, to, downgrade, polygamy, from, a, felony, to, an, infraction, but, it, remains, a, felony, if, force, threats, or, other, abuses, are, involved, unlawful, cohabitation, where, prosecutors, did, not, need, to, prove, that, a, marriage, ceremony, had, taken, place, only, that, a, couple, had, lived, together, had, been, a, major, tool, used, to, prosecute, polygamy, in, utah, since, the, 1882, edmunds, act, cohabitation, in, latin, america, is, becoming, more, common, indeed, although, this, is, a, largely, roman, catholic, region, it, has, the, highest, rates, of, non, marital, childbearing, in, the, world, 55, 74, of, all, children, in, this, region, are, born, to, unmarried, parents, in, mexico, 18, 7, of, all, couples, were, cohabiting, as, of, 2005, among, young, people, the, figures, are, much, higher, as, of, 2000, in, argentina, 58, of, births, were, to, unmarried, women, the, percentage, of, births, outside, marriage, has, increased, throughout, latin, america, during, the, past, decades, and, there, is, also, a, relation, to, place, of, residence, women, living, in, the, capital, city, are, more, likely, to, have, children, outside, marriage, than, those, living, in, other, parts, of, the, country, recent, data, shows, figures, for, non, marital, childbearing, to, be, 74, for, colombia, 69, for, peru, 68, for, chile, 66, for, brazil, and, 55, for, mexico, in, nepal, living, together, is, socially, acceptable, only, after, marriage, however, cohabitation, is, an, emerging, trend, in, urban, areas, of, nepal, reports, have, shown, that, there, may, be, significant, number, of, unmarried, couples, cohabiting, in, cities, especially, in, the, capital, kathmandu, even, when, unmarried, couples, cohabit, they, either, prefer, to, remain, anonymous, or, pose, themselves, as, a, married, couple, cohabitation, is, not, recognized, by, the, law, of, nepal, and, there, is, no, special, provision, to, secure, the, right, of, cohabitants, in, nepalese, law, in, bangladesh, there, are, no, laws, prohibiting, cohabitation, but, it, is, still, socially, unacceptable, however, cohabitation, is, becoming, more, common, in, urban, areas, due, to, western, influence, an, unmarried, couple, may, feel, immense, pressure, to, marry, by, their, family, and, will, probably, choose, to, live, as, if, they, were, married, and, if, exposed, can, be, expelled, from, housing, or, university, cohabitation, has, become, tolerant, in, recent, years, especially, among, youths, in, china, cohabitation, has, become, popular, among, young, adults, one, study, shows, that, the, cohabitation, rate, before, first, marriage, was, over, 20, for, those, born, after, 1977, another, recent, study, shows, that, cohabitation, increases, the, divorce, likelihood, for, those, married, in, the, early, reform, period, but, premarital, cohabitation, has, no, effect, on, divorce, for, those, married, in, the, late, reform, period, in, china, cohabitation, in, india, had, been, taboo, in, traditional, hindu, and, muslim, societies, however, this, is, more, acceptable, between, upper, classes, in, large, cities, but, is, not, often, found, in, rural, areas, and, smaller, towns, which, are, more, social, conservative, live, in, relationships, are, legal, in, india, recent, indian, court, rulings, have, ascribed, some, rights, to, long, term, cohabiting, partners, female, live, in, partners, have, economic, rights, under, protection, of, women, from, domestic, violence, act, 2005, subject, to, following, conditions, as, laid, by, honourable, supreme, court, of, india, in, case, of, d, velusamy, v, d, patchaiammal, on, 12, june, 2020, the, uttarakhand, high, court, stated, in, the, case, of, madhu, bala, v, state, of, uttarakhand, and, others, habeas, corpus, petition, no, 8, of, 2020, that, consensual, cohabitation, between, two, adults, of, the, same, sex, is, legal, in, indonesia, an, islamic, penal, code, proposed, in, 2005, would, have, made, cohabitation, punishable, by, up, to, two, years, in, prison, but, failed, to, pass, the, practice, is, still, frowned, upon, and, many, low, end, hotels, and, boarding, houses, have, been, raided, by, police, for, allowing, unmarried, couples, to, share, a, room, in, japan, according, to, m, iwasawa, at, the, national, institute, of, population, and, social, security, research, less, than, 3, of, females, between, 25, 29, are, currently, cohabiting, but, more, than, one, in, five, have, had, some, experience, of, an, unmarried, partnership, including, cohabitation, a, more, recent, iwasawa, study, has, shown, that, there, has, been, a, recent, emergence, of, non, marital, cohabitation, couples, born, in, the, 1950s, cohort, showed, an, incidence, of, cohabitation, of, 11, 8, where, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, cohorts, showed, cohabitation, rates, of, 30, and, 53, 9, respectively, the, split, between, urban, and, rural, residence, for, people, who, had, cohabited, is, indicates, 68, 8, were, urban, and, 31, 2, were, rural, in, the, philippines, around, 2, 4, million, filipinos, were, cohabiting, as, of, 2004, the, 2000, census, placed, the, percentage, of, cohabiting, couples, at, 19, the, majority, of, individuals, are, between, the, ages, of, 20, 24, poverty, was, often, the, main, factor, in, decision, to, cohabit, in, iran, the, cohabitation, of, two, people, is, known, as, white, marriage, according, to, researchers, the, number, of, white, marriages, in, iranian, metropolises, is, increasing, under, iranian, law, which, is, based, on, islamic, sharia, law, the, cohabitation, of, a, man, and, a, woman, outside, the, framework, of, official, marriage, is, a, crime, it, is, estimated, that, the, duration, of, a, cohabitation, in, iran, is, between, one, and, three, years, cohabitation, has, no, place, in, iran, from, traditional, social, legal, and, religious, points, of, view, however, cohabitation, in, iran, can, be, explained, by, considering, recent, cultural, changes, in, iranian, society, including, the, growth, of, individualism, modernity, and, fluid, relationships, and, the, gaps, and, conflicts, between, values, various, factors, such, as, economic, crises, and, cultural, and, social, changes, in, cities, are, reasons, for, the, increase, in, the, number, of, cohabitation, in, iran, in, other, words, the, emergence, of, capitalism, the, increase, of, job, insecurity, the, emergence, of, moral, liberalism, the, revision, of, cultural, traditions, the, anonymity, of, people, in, cities, the, elimination, of, the, concepts, and, functions, of, neighborhoods, changes, in, family, structures, and, the, emergence, of, temporary, relationships, are, among, the, major, reasons, for, white, marriage, in, iran, new, research, published, by, social, anthropologist, kameel, ahmady, and, his, team, under, the, title, house, with, open, door, a, comprehensive, research, study, on, white, marriage, cohabitation, in, iran, reveals, the, previously, concealed, and, multi, dimensional, aspects, of, this, phenomenon, at, the, macro, level, focusing, on, the, tehran, mashhad, and, isfahan, metropolitan, areas, the, research, pieces, argues, that, this, phenomenon, is, more, prevalent, among, educated, and, post, graduate, young, people, who, have, migrated, to, metropolitan, areas, for, work, and, education, in, the, european, union, cohabitation, is, very, common, in, 2014, 42, of, all, births, in, the, 28, eu, countries, were, nonmarital, in, the, following, european, countries, the, majority, of, births, occur, outside, marriage, iceland, 69, 9, in, 2016, france, 59, 7, in, 2016,

netherlands, 50, 4, in, 2016, while, couples, of, all, ages, cohabit, the, phenomenon, is, much, more, common, among, younger, people, in, late, 2005, 21, of, families, in, finland, consisted, of, cohabiting, couples, all, age, groups, of, couples, with, children, 18, were, cohabiting, of, ages, 18, and, above, in, 2003, 13, 4, were, cohabiting, generally, cohabitation, amongst, finns, is, most, common, for, people, under, 30, legal, obstacles, for, cohabitation, were, removed, in, 1926, in, a, reform, of, the, criminal, code, while, the, phenomenon, was, socially, accepted, much, later, on, in, france, 17, 5, of, couples, were, cohabiting, as, of, 1999, in, britain, today, nearly, half, of, babies, are, born, to, people, who, are, not, married, in, the, united, kingdom, 47, 3, in, 2011, in, scotland, in, 2012, the, proportion, was, 51, 3, it, is, estimated, that, by, 2016, the, majority, of, births, in, the, uk, will, be, to, unmarried, parents, the, victorian, era, of, the, late, 19th, century, is, famous, for, the, victorian, standards, of, personal, morality, historians, generally, agree, that, the, middle, classes, held, high, personal, moral, standards, and, rejected, cohabitation, they, have, debated, whether, the, working, classes, followed, suit, moralists, in, the, late, 19th, century, such, as, henry, mayhew, decried, high, levels, of, cohabitation, without, marriage, and, illegitimate, births, in, london, slums, however, new, research, using, computerized, matching, of, data, files, shows, that, the, rates, of, cohabitation, were, quite, low, under, 5, for, the, working, class, and, the, urban, poor, falling, marriage, rates, and, increased, births, outside, marriage, have, become, a, political, issue, with, questions, of, whether, the, government, should, promote, marriage, or, focus, on, the, status, of, a, parent, rather, than, a, spouse, the, conservative, party, support, the, former, whilst, labour, party, and, the, liberal, democrats, support, the, latter, there, are, also, differences, between, england, and, wales, and, scotland, with, the, latter, being, more, accepting, of, cohabitation, in, bulgaria, there, has, been, a, rapid, increase, in, cohabitation, after, the, fall, of, communism, the, transition, from, communism, to, market, economy, had, a, great, impact, on, the, demographic, behavior, of, the, population, after, the, fall, of, communism, the, legal, and, social, pressure, to, get, married, has, declined, and, the, population, has, started, to, experience, new, life, styles, as, of, 2014, 58, 8, of, children, were, born, to, unmarried, mothers, the, marriage, rates, in, czech, republic, have, fallen, dramatically, during, the, past, decades, in, the, 1970s, to, 1980s, about, 96, 97, of, women, married, in, 2000, it, was, estimated, that, only, 75, of, women, would, ever, marry, the, age, at, first, marriage, for, women, has, increased, from, being, in, the, range, of, 21, 4, 21, 8, years, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, to, being, 29, 6, in, 2011, in, the, early, 1990s, predictions, were, made, by, some, czech, demographers, that, cohabitation, would, increase, during, the, next, decades, and, indeed, there, has, been, a, marked, increase, in, the, number, of, people, who, live, in, non, marital, couple, relations, in, 2016, 48, 6, of, births, were, to, unmarried, women, until, the, 1980s, it, was, illegal, for, unmarried, couples, to, cohabitate, which, made, it, impossible, for, many, same, sex, couples, to, live, together, at, this, point, the, bundesgerichtshof, ruled, that, cohabitation, could, not, be, banned, as, it, was, protected, by, the, basic, law, as, in, other, western, societies, patterns, of, family, life, have, been, changing, in, germany, during, the, past, decades, this, has, not, created, a, moral, panic, but, has, been, seen, more, as, an, ongoing, social, evolution, cohabitation, divorce, rates, lone, parents, and, people, s, reluctance, to, marry, or, to, have, children, have, increased, however, with, regards, to, family, formation, and, long, term, cohabitation, instead, of, marriage, there, are, very, strong, differences, between, the, regions, of, former, west, germany, and, east, germany, which, was, formally, communist, significantly, more, children, are, born, out, of, wedlock, in, eastern, germany, than, in, western, germany, in, 2012, in, eastern, germany, 61, 6, of, births, were, to, unmarried, women, while, in, western, germany, only, 28, 4, were, a, longitudinal, survey, found, that, union, stability, was, significantly, higher, for, cohabiting, mothers, in, eastern, germany, than, western, germany, due, to, differences, in, german, society, in, greece, family, dynamics, remain, conservative, the, principal, form, of, partnership, is, marriage, and, extramarital, childbearing, and, long, term, cohabitation, are, not, widespread, for, instance, in, 2016, only, 9, 4, of, births, were, outside, marriage, which, is, the, lowest, percentage, among, the, european, union, member, states, religion, in, greece, plays, a, very, important, role, in, society, it, was, only, in, 1983, that, civil, marriage, was, introduced, in, the, country, the, new, laws, modernized, family, law, abolished, dowry, and, provided, for, equal, rights, for, illegitimate, children, according, to, a, 2008, study, greek, society, still, remains, conservative, and, birthing, outside, marriage, although, protected, by, law, remains, in, many, ways, socially, unacceptable, despite, this, there, have, been, further, legal, changes, providing, for, a, modern, western, outlook, on, family, life, including, law, 3719, 2008, dealing, with, family, issues, including, article, 14, of, the, law, which, reduced, the, separation, period, necessary, before, a, divorce, in, certain, circumstances, from, four, years, to, two, years, the, literature, on, second, demographic, transition, argues, as, well, that, highly, educated, women, are, more, prone, to, engage, in, cohabitation, although, the, reasons, are, different, they, are, less, concerned, with, respecting, the, societal, norms, some, scholars, argued, that, cohabitation, is, very, similar, to, being, single, in, the, sense, of, not, giving, up, independence, and, personal, autonomy, in, hungary, cohabitation, was, an, uncommon, phenomenon, until, the, late, 1980s, and, it, was, largely, confined, to, the, divorced, or, widowed, individuals, among, the, ethnic, groups, gypsy, roma, tended, to, have, higher, rates, of, cohabitation, mainly, due, to, their, reluctance, to, register, their, marriages, officially, since, the, 1980s, cohabitation, became, much, more, frequent, among, all, ethnic, groups, and, it, has, been, argued, to, have, strongly, influenced, the, decline, in, fertility, in, 2015, 47, 9, of, births, were, to, unmarried, women, cohabitation, in, ireland, has, increased, in, recent, years, and, 36, 6, of, births, were, to, unmarried, women, in, 2016, until, a, few, decades, ago, women, who, had, children, outside, marriage, were, severely, stigmatized, and, often, detained, in, magdalene, laundries, the, civil, partnership, and, certain, rights, and, obligations, of, cohabitants, act, 2010, gives, some, rights, to, unmarried, cohabitants, under, this, act, same, sex, couples, can,
