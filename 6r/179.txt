overall, feelings, and, resultant, emotions, the, wiley, blackwell, encyclopedia, of, family, studies, states, that, romantic, love, based, on, the, model, of, mutual, attraction, and, on, a, connection, between, two, people, that, bonds, them, as, a, couple, creates, the, conditions, for, overturning, the, model, of, family, and, marriage, that, it, engenders, this, indicates, that, romantic, love, can, be, the, founding, of, attraction, between, two, people, this, term, was, primarily, used, by, the, western, countries, after, the, 1800s, were, socialized, into, love, is, the, necessary, prerequisite, for, starting, an, intimate, relationship, and, represents, the, foundation, on, which, to, build, the, next, steps, in, a, family, alternatively, collins, dictionary, describes, romantic, love, as, an, intensity, and, idealization, of, a, love, relationship, in, which, the, other, is, imbued, with, extraordinary, virtue, beauty, etc, so, that, the, relationship, overrides, all, other, considerations, including, material, ones, although, the, emotions, and, sensations, of, romantic, love, are, widely, associated, with, sexual, attraction, they, could, also, exist, without, sexual, attraction, in, certain, cases, romance, could, even, be, interpreted, as, a, normal, friendship, historically, the, term, romance, originates, with, the, medieval, ideal, of, chivalry, as, set, out, in, the, literature, of, chivalric, romance, people, who, experience, little, to, no, romantic, attraction, are, referred, to, as, aromantic, bode, kushnick, undertook, a, comprehensive, review, of, romantic, love, from, a, biological, perspective, in, 2021, they, considered, the, psychology, of, romantic, love, its, mechanisms, development, across, the, lifespan, functions, and, evolutionary, history, based, on, the, content, of, that, review, they, proposed, a, biological, definition, of, romantic, love, romantic, love, is, a, motivational, state, typically, associated, with, a, desire, for, long, term, mating, with, a, particular, individual, it, occurs, across, the, lifespan, and, is, associated, with, distinctive, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, social, genetic, neural, and, endocrine, activity, in, both, sexes, throughout, much, of, the, life, course, it, serves, mate, choice, courtship, sex, and, pair, bonding, functions, it, is, a, suite, of, adaptations, and, by, products, that, arose, sometime, during, the, recent, evolutionary, history, of, humans, anthropologist, charles, lindholm, defined, love, as, any, intense, attraction, that, involves, the, idealization, of, the, other, within, an, erotic, context, with, expectation, of, enduring, sometime, into, the, future, the, word, romance, comes, from, the, french, vernacular, where, initially, it, indicated, a, verse, narrative, the, word, was, originally, an, adverb, of, latin, origin, romanicus, meaning, of, the, roman, style, european, medieval, vernacular, tales, epics, and, ballads, generally, dealt, with, chivalric, adventure, not, bringing, in, the, concept, of, love, until, late, into, the, seventeenth, century, the, word, romance, developed, other, meanings, such, as, the, early, nineteenth, century, spanish, and, italian, definitions, of, adventurous, and, passionate, which, could, intimate, both, love, affair, and, idealistic, quality, anthropologists, such, as, claude, l, vi, strauss, show, that, there, were, complex, forms, of, courtship, in, ancient, as, well, as, contemporary, primitive, societies, there, may, not, be, evidence, however, that, members, of, such, societies, formed, loving, relationships, distinct, from, their, established, customs, in, a, way, that, would, parallel, modern, romance, marriages, were, often, arranged, but, the, wishes, of, those, to, be, wed, were, considered, as, affection, was, important, to, primitive, tribes, in, the, majority, of, primitive, societies, studied, by, the, anthropologists, the, extramarital, and, premarital, relations, between, men, and, women, were, completely, free, the, members, of, the, temporary, couples, were, sexually, attracted, to, each, other, more, than, to, anyone, else, but, in, all, other, respects, their, relationships, had, not, demonstrated, the, characteristics, of, romantic, love, in, the, book, of, boris, shipov, theory, of, romantic, love, the, corresponding, evidences, of, anthropologists, have, been, collected, lewis, h, morgan, the, passion, of, love, was, unknown, among, the, barbarians, they, are, below, the, sentiment, which, is, the, offspring, of, civilization, and, super, added, refinement, of, love, was, unknown, among, the, barbarians, margaret, mead, romantic, love, as, it, occurs, in, our, civilisation, inextricably, bound, up, with, ideas, of, monogamy, exclusiveness, jealousy, and, undeviating, fidelity, does, not, occur, in, samoa, bronislaw, malinowski, though, the, social, code, does, not, favour, romance, romantic, elements, and, imaginative, personal, attachments, are, not, altogether, absent, in, trobriand, courtship, and, marriage, the, phenomenon, which, b, malinowski, calls, love, actually, has, very, little, in, common, with, the, european, love, thus, there, is, nothing, roundabout, in, a, trobriand, wooing, nor, do, they, seek, full, personal, relations, with, sexual, possession, only, as, a, consequence, simply, and, directly, a, meeting, is, asked, for, with, the, avowed, intention, of, sexual, gratification, if, the, invitation, is, accepted, the, satisfaction, of, the, boy, s, desire, eliminates, the, romantic, frame, of, mind, the, craving, for, the, unattainable, and, mysterious, an, important, point, is, that, the, pair, s, community, of, interest, is, limited, to, the, sexual, relation, only, the, couple, share, a, bed, and, nothing, else, there, are, no, services, to, be, mutually, rendered, they, have, no, obligation, to, help, each, other, in, any, way, the, aborigines, of, mangaia, island, of, polynesia, who, mastered, the, english, language, used, the, word, love, with, a, completely, different, meaning, as, compared, to, that, which, is, usual, for, the, person, brought, up, in, the, european, culture, donald, s, marshall, mangaian, informants, and, co, workers, were, quite, interested, in, the, european, concept, of, love, english, speaking, mangaians, had, previously, used, the, term, only, in, a, physical, sense, of, sexual, desire, to, say, i, love, you, in, english, to, another, person, was, tantamount, to, saying, i, want, to, copulate, with, you, the, components, of, affection, and, companionship, which, may, characterize, the, european, use, of, the, term, puzzled, the, mangaians, when, we, discussed, the, term, the, principal, findings, that, one, can, draw, from, an, analysis, of, emotional, components, of, sexual, relationship, feelings, on, mangaia, are, nathaniel, branden, claims, that, by, virtue, of, the, tribal, mentality, in, primitive, cultures, the, idea, of, romantic, love, did, not, exist, at, all, passionate, individual, attachments, are, evidently, seen, as, threatening, to, tribal, values, and, tribal, authority, dr, audrey, richards, an, anthropologist, who, lived, among, the, bemba, of, northern, rhodesia, in, the, 1930s, once, related, to, a, group, of, them, an, english, folk, fable, about, a, young, prince, who, climbed, glass, mountains, crossed, chasms, and, fought, dragons, all, to, obtain, the, hand, of, a, maiden, he, loved, the, bemba, were, plainly, bewildered, but, remained, silent, finally, an, old, chief, spoke, up, voicing, the, feelings, of, all, present, in, the, simplest, of, questions, why, not, take, another, girl, he, asked, the, earliest, recorded, marriages, in, mesopotamia, greece, rome, and, among, hebrews, were, used, to, secure, alliances, and, produce, offspring, it, was, not, until, the, middle, ages, that, love, began, to, be, a, real, part, of, marriage, the, marriages, that, did, arise, outside, of, arranged, marriage, were, most, often, spontaneous, relationships, in, ladies, of, the, leisure, class, rutgers, university, professor, bonnie, g, smith, depicts, courtship, and, marriage, rituals, that, may, be, viewed, as, oppressive, to, modern, people, she, writes, when, the, young, women, of, the, nord, married, they, did, so, without, illusions, of, love, and, romance, they, acted, within, a, framework, of, concern, for, the, reproduction, of, bloodlines, according, to, financial, professional, and, sometimes, political, interests, anthony, giddens, in, the, transformation, of, intimacy, sexuality, love, and, eroticism, in, modern, society, states, that, romantic, love, introduced, the, idea, of, a, narrative, to, an, individual, s, life, and, telling, a, story, is, a, root, meaning, of, the, term, romance, according, to, giddens, the, rise, of, romantic, love, more, or, less, coincided, with, the, emergence, of, the, novel, it, was, then, that, romantic, love, associated, with, freedom, and, therefore, the, ideals, of, romantic, love, created, the, ties, between, freedom, and, self, realization, david, r, shumway, states, that, the, discourse, of, intimacy, emerged, in, the, last, third, of, the, 20th, century, intended, to, explain, how, marriage, and, other, relationships, worked, and, making, the, specific, case, that, emotional, closeness, is, much, more, important, than, passion, with, intimacy, and, romance, coexisting, one, example, of, the, changes, experienced, in, relationships, in, the, early, 21st, century, was, explored, by, giddens, regarding, homosexual, relationships, according, to, giddens, since, homosexuals, were, not, able, to, marry, they, were, forced, to, pioneer, more, open, and, negotiated, relationships, these, kinds, of, relationships, then, permeated, the, heterosexual, population, anthropologist, and, author, helen, fisher, has, argued, that, romantic, love, is, a, mammalian, brain, system, evolved, for, selecting, a, preferred, mating, partner, fisher, s, team, has, proposed, that, romantic, love, may, have, evolved, around, the, time, of, bipedalism, when, new, mothers, needed, additional, protection, and, provision, while, having, to, carry, their, young, a, 2023, paper, by, adam, bode, has, argued, that, while, fisher, s, evolutionary, theory, has, been, the, predominant, one, for, 25, years, romantic, love, could, be, better, explained, by, evolutionary, co, option, of, the, systems, for, mother, infant, bonding, fisher, likens, romantic, love, to, mammalian, courtship, attraction, but, bode, argues, courtship, attraction, is, separate, in, f, engels, book, the, origin, of, the, family, private, property, and, the, state, monogamy, was, the, only, known, form, of, the, family, under, which, modern, sex, love, could, develop, it, does, not, follow, that, this, love, developed, or, even, predominantly, within, it, as, the, mutual, love, of, the, spouses, the, whole, nature, of, strict, monogamian, marriage, under, male, domination, ruled, this, out, sigmund, freud, stated, it, can, easily, be, shown, that, the, psychical, value, of, erotic, needs, is, reduced, as, soon, as, their, satisfaction, becomes, easy, an, obstacle, is, required, in, order, to, heighten, libido, and, where, natural, resistances, to, satisfaction, have, not, been, sufficient, men, have, at, all, times, erected, conventional, ones, so, as, to, be, able, to, enjoy, love, this, is, true, both, of, individuals, and, of, nations, in, times, in, which, there, were, no, difficulties, standing, in, the, way, of, sexual, satisfaction, such, as, perhaps, during, the, decline, of, the, ancient, civilizations, love, became, worthless, and, life, empty, some, believe, that, romantic, love, evolved, independently, in, multiple, cultures, for, example, in, an, article, presented, by, henry, grunebaum, he, argues, therapists, mistakenly, believe, that, romantic, love, is, a, phenomenon, unique, to, western, cultures, and, first, expressed, by, the, troubadours, of, the, middle, ages, the, word, romance, is, derived, from, the, latin, adverb, romanice, meaning, in, the, vernacular, in, reference, to, the, languages, old, french, and, old, occitan, these, languages, were, descendants, of, latin, the, language, of, the, romans, evolutions, of, the, word, romanice, were, used, to, refer, first, to, the, romance, languages, and, eventually, also, to, the, works, composed, in, them, the, genre, of, chivalric, romance, initially, focused, on, the, heroic, military, deeds, of, knights, which, led, to, the, use, of, the, word, romantic, in, the, sense, of, chivalrous, as, the, genre, evolved, starting, after, the, renaissance, and, especially, in, the, romantic, period, it, focused, increasingly, on, love, in, the, modern, sense, the, general, idea, of, romantic, love, in, the, western, tradition, is, believed, to, have, originated, in, the, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, primarily, from, that, of, the, french, culture, this, idea, is, what, has, spurred, the, connection, between, the, words, romantic, and, lover, thus, coining, english, phrases, for, romantic, love, such, as, loving, like, the, romans, do, the, precise, origins, of, such, a, connection, are, unknown, however, although, the, word, romance, or, the, equivalents, thereof, may, not, have, the, same, connotation, in, other, cultures, the, general, idea, of, romantic, love, appears, to, have, crossed, cultures, and, been, accepted, as, a, concept, at, one, point, in, time, or, another, the, conception, of, romantic, love, was, popularized, in, western, culture, by, the, concept, of, courtly, love, knights, of, the, middle, ages, were, thought, to, have, engaged, in, non, sexual, relationships, with, women, of, nobility, whom, they, served, these, relations, were, highly, elaborate, and, ritualized, in, a, complexity, that, was, steeped, in, a, framework, of, tradition, which, stemmed, from, theories, of, etiquette, derived, out, of, chivalry, as, a, moral, code, of, conduct, courtly, love, and, the, notion, of, domnei, were, often, the, subjects, of, troubadours, and, could, be, typically, found, in, artistic, endeavors, such, as, lyrical, narratives, and, poetic, prose, of, the, time, since, marriage, was, commonly, a, formal, arrangement, courtly, love, sometimes, permitted, expressions, of, emotional, closeness, that, may, have, been, lacking, from, the, union, between, husband, and, wife, courtly, love, did, not, necessarily, refer, to, those, engaging, in, sexual, acts, it, may, also, have, referred, to, caring, and, emotional, intimacy, the, bond, between, a, knight, and, his, lady, or, the, woman, of, typically, high, stature, of, whom, he, served, may, in, some, cases, have, been, one, such, example, religious, meditations, upon, the, virgin, mary, were, partially, responsible, for, the, development, of, chivalry, as, an, ethic, and, lifestyle, a, lady, s, honor, and, a, knight, s, devotion, to, her, coupled, with, an, obligatory, respect, for, all, women, factored, prominently, in, the, identity, of, medieval, knighthood, members, of, the, aristocracy, were, schooled, in, the, principles, of, chivalry, which, facilitated, important, changes, in, attitudes, regarding, the, value, of, women, modern, historians, such, as, d, w, robertson, jr, john, c, moore, and, e, talbot, donaldson, consider, the, concept, of, courtly, love, to, be, a, modern, invention, donaldson, called, it, the, myth, of, courtly, love, on, the, basis, that, it, is, not, supported, in, medieval, texts, other, scholars, consider, courtly, love, to, have, been, purely, a, literary, convention, examples, of, allegorical, use, of, the, concept, can, be, found, in, the, middle, ages, but, there, are, no, historical, records, that, offer, evidence, of, its, presence, in, reality, historian, john, benton, found, no, documentary, evidence, in, law, codes, court, cases, chronicles, or, other, historical, documents, romantic, love, is, contrasted, with, platonic, love, which, in, all, usages, precludes, sexual, relations, yet, only, in, the, modern, usage, does, it, take, on, a, fully, nonsexual, sense, rather, than, the, classical, sense, in, which, sexual, drives, are, sublimated, unrequited, love, can, be, romantic, in, different, ways, comic, tragic, or, in, the, sense, that, sublimation, itself, is, comparable, to, romance, where, the, spirituality, of, both, art, and, egalitarian, ideals, is, combined, with, strong, character, and, emotions, unrequited, love, is, typical, of, the, period, of, romanticism, but, the, term, is, distinct, from, any, romance, that, might, arise, within, it, romantic, love, may, also, be, classified, according, to, two, categories, popular, romance, and, divine, or, spiritual, romance, greek, philosophers, and, authors, have, had, many, theories, of, love, some, of, these, theories, are, presented, in, plato, s, symposium, six, athenian, friends, including, socrates, drink, wine, and, each, give, a, speech, praising, the, deity, eros, when, his, turn, comes, aristophanes, says, in, his, mythical, speech, that, sexual, partners, seek, each, other, because, they, are, descended, from, beings, with, spherical, torsos, two, sets, of, human, limbs, genitalia, on, each, side, and, two, faces, back, to, back, their, three, forms, included, the, three, permutations, of, pairs, of, gender, i, e, one, masculine, and, masculine, another, feminine, and, feminine, and, the, third, masculine, and, feminine, and, they, were, split, by, the, gods, to, thwart, the, creatures, assault, on, heaven, recapitulated, according, to, the, comic, playwright, in, other, myths, such, as, the, aloadae, this, story, is, relevant, to, modern, romance, partly, because, of, the, image, of, reciprocity, it, shows, between, the, sexes, in, the, final, speech, before, alcibiades, arrives, socrates, gives, his, encomium, of, love, and, desire, as, a, lack, of, being, namely, the, being, or, form, of, beauty, though, there, are, many, theories, of, romantic, love, such, as, that, of, robert, sternberg, in, which, it, is, merely, a, mean, combining, liking, and, sexual, desire, the, major, theories, involve, far, more, insight, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, freud, s, theory, of, the, family, drama, dominated, theories, of, romance, and, sexual, relationships, this, gave, rise, to, a, few, counter, theories, theorists, like, deleuze, counter, freud, and, jacques, lacan, by, attempting, to, return, to, a, more, naturalistic, philosophy, ren, girard, argues, that, romantic, attraction, is, a, product, of, jealousy, and, rivalry, particularly, in, a, triangular, form, girard, in, any, case, downplays, romance, s, individuality, in, favor, of, jealousy, and, the, love, triangle, arguing, that, romantic, attraction, arises, primarily, in, the, observed, attraction, between, two, others, a, natural, objection, is, that, this, is, circular, reasoning, but, girard, means, that, a, small, measure, of, attraction, reaches, a, critical, point, insofar, as, it, is, caught, up, in, mimesis, shakespeare, s, plays, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, as, you, like, it, and, the, winter, s, tale, are, the, best, known, examples, of, competitive, induced, romance, girard, s, theory, of, mimetic, desire, is, controversial, because, of, its, alleged, sexism, this, view, has, to, some, extent, supplanted, its, predecessor, freudian, oedipal, theory, it, may, find, some, spurious, support, in, the, supposed, attraction, of, women, to, aggressive, men, as, a, technique, of, attraction, often, combined, with, irony, it, is, sometimes, advised, that, one, feign, toughness, and, disinterest, but, it, can, be, a, trivial, or, crude, idea, to, promulgate, to, men, and, it, is, not, given, with, much, understanding, of, mimetic, desire, in, mind, instead, cultivating, a, spirit, of, self, sacrifice, coupled, with, an, attitude, of, appreciation, or, contemplation, directed, towards, the, other, of, one, s, attractions, constitutes, the, ideals, of, what, we, consider, to, be, true, romantic, love, mimesis, is, always, the, desire, to, possess, in, renouncing, it, we, offer, ourselves, as, a, sacrificial, gift, to, the, other, mimetic, desire, is, often, challenged, by, feminists, such, as, toril, moi, who, argue, that, it, does, not, account, for, the, woman, as, inherently, desired, though, the, centrality, of, rivalry, is, not, itself, a, cynical, view, it, does, emphasize, the, mechanical, in, love, relations, in, that, sense, it, does, resonate, with, capitalism, and, cynicism, native, to, post, modernity, romance, in, this, context, leans, more, on, fashion, and, irony, though, these, were, important, for, it, in, less, emancipated, times, sexual, revolutions, have, brought, change, to, these, areas, wit, or, irony, therefore, encompass, an, instability, of, romance, that, is, not, entirely, new, but, has, a, more, central, social, role, fine, tuned, to, certain, modern, peculiarities, and, subversion, originating, in, various, social, revolutions, culminating, mostly, in, the, 1960s, the, process, of, courtship, also, contributed, to, arthur, schopenhauer, s, pessimism, despite, his, own, romantic, success, and, he, argued, that, to, be, rid, of, the, challenge, of, courtship, would, drive, people, to, suicide, with, boredom, schopenhauer, theorized, that, individuals, seek, partners, looking, for, a, complement, or, completing, of, themselves, in, a, partner, as, in, the, clich, that, opposites, attract, but, with, the, added, consideration, that, both, partners, manifest, this, attraction, for, the, sake, of, the, species, but, what, ultimately, draws, two, individuals, of, different, sex, exclusively, to, each, other, with, such, power, is, the, will, to, live, which, manifests, itself, in, the, whole, species, and, here, anticipates, in, the, individual, that, these, two, can, produce, an, objectification, of, its, true, nature, corresponding, to, its, aims, world, as, will, and, representation, volume, 2, chapter, xliv, later, modern, philosophers, such, as, la, rochefoucauld, david, hume, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, also, focused, on, morality, but, desire, was, central, to, french, thought, and, hume, himself, tended, to, adopt, a, french, worldview, and, temperament, desire, in, this, milieu, meant, a, very, general, idea, termed, the, passions, and, this, general, interest, was, distinct, from, the, contemporary, idea, of, passionate, now, equated, with, romantic, love, was, a, central, topic, again, in, the, subsequent, movement, of, romanticism, which, focused, on, such, things, as, absorption, in, nature, and, the, absolute, as, well, as, platonic, and, unrequited, love, in, german, philosophy, and, literature, french, philosopher, gilles, deleuze, linked, this, concept, of, love, as, a, lack, mainly, to, sigmund, freud, and, deleuze, often, criticized, it, victor, c, de, munck, and, david, b, kronenfeld, conducted, a, study, named, romantic, love, in, the, united, states, applying, cultural, models, theory, and, methods, this, study, was, conducted, through, an, investigation, of, two, cultural, model, cases, it, states, that, in, america, we, have, a, rather, and, dynamic, cultural, model, that, is, falsifiable, and, predictive, of, successful, love, relationships, which, supports, that, is, popular, for, american, people, to, successfully, share, feelings, of, romanticism, with, each, other, s, partners, it, describes, american, culture, by, stating, the, model, is, unique, in, that, it, combines, passion, with, comfort, and, friendship, as, properties, of, romantic, love, one, of, its, main, contributions, is, advising, the, reader, that, for, successful, romantic, love, relations, a, person, would, feel, excited, about, meeting, their, beloved, make, passionate, and, intimate, love, as, opposed, to, only, physical, love, feel, comfortable, with, the, beloved, behaving, in, a, companionable, friendly, way, with, one, s, partner, listen, to, the, other, s, concerns, offering, to, help,

there, at, this, point, any, display, of, affection, between, isabella, and, the, duke, if, by, affection, we, mean, something, concerned, with, sexual, attraction, the, two, at, the, end, of, the, play, love, each, other, as, they, love, virtue, in, romeo, and, juliet, in, saying, all, combined, save, what, thou, must, combine, by, holy, marriage, romeo, implies, that, it, is, not, marriage,

disillusionment, the, desire, to, possess, the, partner, results, in, the, partner, wanting, to, escape, and, the, friction, against, sex, result, in, non, fulfillment, disillusionment, plus, the, desire, to, escape, plus, non, fulfillment, result, in, a, secret, hostility, which, causes, the, other, partner, to, feel, alienated, secret, hostility, in, one, and, secret, alienation, in, the, other, cause, the, partners, to, secretly, hate, each, other, this, secret, hate, often, leads, one, or, the, other, or, both, to, seek, love, objects, outside, the, marriage, or, relationship, psychologist, harold, bessell, in, his, book, the, love, test, reconciles, the, opposing, forces, noted, by, the, above, researchers, and, shows, that, there, are, two, factors, that, determine, the, quality, of, a, relationship, bessell, proposes, that, people, are, drawn, together, by, a, force, he, calls, romantic, attraction, which, is, a, combination, of, genetic, and, cultural, factors, this, force, may, be, weak, or, strong, and, may, be, felt, to, different, degrees, by, each, of, the, two, love, partners, the, other, factor, is, emotional, maturity, which, is, the, degree, to, which, a, person, is, capable, of, providing, good, treatment, in, a, love, relationship, it, can, thus, be, said, that, an, immature, person, is, more, likely, to, overestimate, love, become, disillusioned, and, have, an, affair, whereas, a, mature, person, is, more, likely, to, see, the, relationship, in, realistic, terms, and, act, constructively, to, work, out, problems, romantic, love, in, the, abstract, sense, of, the, term, is, traditionally, considered, to, involve, a, mix, of, emotional, and, sexual, desire, for, another, as, a, person, however, lisa, m, diamond, a, university, of, utah, psychology, professor, proposes, that, sexual, desire, and, romantic, love, are, functionally, independent, and, that, romantic, love, is, not, intrinsically, oriented, to, same, gender, or, other, gender, partners, she, also, proposes, that, the, links, between, love, and, desire, are, bidirectional, as, opposed, to, unilateral, furthermore, diamond, does, not, state, that, one, s, sex, has, priority, over, another, sex, a, male, or, female, in, romantic, love, because, her, theory, suggests, it, is, as, possible, for, someone, who, is, homosexual, to, fall, in, love, with, someone, of, the, other, gender, as, for, someone, who, is, heterosexual, to, fall, in, love, with, someone, of, the, same, gender, in, her, 2012, review, of, this, topic, diamond, emphasized, that, what, is, true, for, men, may, not, be, true, for, women, according, to, diamond, in, most, men, sexual, orientation, is, fixed, and, most, likely, innate, but, in, many, women, sexual, orientation, may, vary, from, 0, to, 6, on, the, kinsey, scale, and, back, again, martie, haselton, a, psychologist, at, ucla, considers, romantic, love, a, commitment, device, or, mechanism, that, encourages, two, humans, to, form, a, lasting, bond, she, has, explored, the, evolutionary, rationale, that, has, shaped, modern, romantic, love, and, has, concluded, that, long, lasting, relationships, are, helpful, to, ensure, that, children, reach, reproductive, age, and, are, fed, and, cared, for, by, two, parents, haselton, and, her, colleagues, have, found, evidence, in, their, experiments, that, suggest, love, s, adaptation, the, first, part, of, the, experiments, consists, of, having, people, think, about, how, much, they, love, someone, and, then, suppress, thoughts, of, other, attractive, people, in, the, second, part, of, the, experiment, the, same, people, are, asked, to, think, about, how, much, they, sexually, desire, those, same, partners, and, then, try, to, suppress, thoughts, about, others, the, results, showed, that, love, is, more, efficient, in, pushing, out, those, rivals, than, sex, research, by, the, university, of, pavia, suggests, that, romantic, love, lasts, for, about, a, year, similar, to, limerence, before, being, replaced, by, a, more, stable, non, passionate, companionate, love, in, companionate, love, changes, occur, from, the, early, stage, of, love, to, when, the, relationship, becomes, more, established, and, romantic, feelings, seem, to, end, however, research, from, stony, brook, university, in, new, york, suggests, that, some, couples, keep, romantic, feelings, alive, for, much, longer, attachment, styles, that, people, develop, as, children, can, influence, the, way, that, they, interact, with, partners, in, adult, relationships, with, secure, attachment, styles, being, associated, with, healthier, and, more, trusting, relationships, than, avoidant, or, anxious, attachment, styles, hazen, and, shaver, found, that, adult, romantic, attachment, styles, were, similar, to, the, categories, of, secure, avoidant, and, anxious, that, had, previously, been, studied, in, children, s, attachments, to, their, caregivers, demonstrating, that, attachment, styles, are, stable, across, the, lifespan, later, on, researchers, distinguished, between, dismissive, avoidant, attachment, and, fearful, avoidant, attachment, others, have, found, that, secure, adult, attachment, leading, to, the, ability, for, intimacy, and, confidence, in, relationship, stability, is, characterized, by, low, attachment, related, anxiety, and, avoidance, while, the, fearful, style, is, high, on, both, dimensions, the, dismissing, style, is, low, on, anxiety, and, high, on, avoidance, and, the, preoccupied, style, is, high, on, anxiety, and, low, on, avoidance, irving, singer, first, defined, love, based, on, four, greek, terms, eros, meaning, the, search, for, beauty, philia, the, feelings, of, affection, in, close, friendships, nomos, the, submission, of, and, obedience, to, higher, or, divine, powers, and, agape, the, bestowal, of, love, and, affection, for, the, divine, powers, while, singer, did, believe, that, love, was, important, to, world, culture, he, did, not, believe, that, romantic, love, played, a, major, role, however, susan, hendrick, and, clyde, hendrick, at, texas, tech, university, have, theorized, that, romantic, love, will, play, an, increasingly, important, cultural, role, in, the, future, as, it, is, considered, an, important, part, of, living, a, fulfilling, life, they, also, theorized, that, love, in, long, term, romantic, relationships, has, only, been, the, product, of, cultural, forces, that, came, to, fruition, within, the, past, 300, years, by, cultural, forces, they, mean, the, increasing, prevalence, of, individualistic, ideologies, which, are, the, result, of, an, inward, shift, of, many, cultural, worldviews, researchers, have, determined, that, romantic, love, is, a, complex, emotion, that, can, be, divided, into, either, passionate, or, companionate, forms, berscheid, and, walster, and, hatfield, found, that, these, two, forms, can, co, exist, either, simultaneously, or, intermittently, passionate, love, is, an, arousal, driven, emotion, that, often, gives, people, extreme, feelings, of, happiness, and, can, also, give, people, feelings, of, anguish, companionate, love, is, a, form, that, creates, a, steadfast, bond, between, two, people, and, gives, people, feelings, of, peace, researchers, have, described, the, stage, of, passionate, love, as, being, on, cocaine, since, during, that, stage, the, brain, releases, the, same, neurotransmitter, dopamine, as, when, cocaine, is, being, used, it, is, also, estimated, that, passionate, love, as, with, limerence, lasts, for, about, twelve, to, eighteen, months, hendrick, and, hendrick, studied, college, students, who, were, in, the, early, stages, of, a, relationship, and, found, that, almost, half, reported, that, their, significant, other, was, their, closest, friend, providing, evidence, that, both, passionate, and, companionate, love, exist, in, new, relationships, conversely, in, a, study, of, long, term, marriages, contreras, hendrick, and, hendrick, found, that, couples, endorsed, measures, of, both, companionate, love, and, passionate, love, and, that, passionate, love, was, the, strongest, predictor, of, marital, satisfaction, showing, that, both, types, of, love, can, endure, throughout, the, years, psychologist, robert, sternberg, developed, the, triangular, theory, of, love, he, theorized, that, love, is, a, combination, of, three, main, components, passion, physical, arousal, intimacy, psychological, feelings, of, closeness, and, commitment, the, sustaining, of, a, relationship, he, also, theorized, that, the, different, combinations, of, these, three, components, could, yield, up, to, seven, different, forms, of, love, these, include, popularized, forms, such, as, romantic, love, intimacy, and, passion, and, consummate, love, passion, intimacy, and, commitment, the, other, forms, are, liking, intimacy, companionate, love, intimacy, and, commitment, empty, love, commitment, fatuous, love, passion, and, commitment, and, infatuation, passion, studies, on, sternberg, s, theory, love, found, that, intimacy, most, strongly, predicted, marital, satisfaction, in, married, couples, with, passion, also, being, an, important, predictor, silberman, 1995, on, the, other, hand, acker, and, davis, found, that, commitment, was, the, strongest, predictor, of, relationship, satisfaction, especially, for, long, term, relationships, researchers, arthur, and, elaine, aron, theorized, that, humans, have, a, basic, drive, to, expand, their, self, concepts, further, their, experience, with, eastern, concepts, of, love, caused, them, to, believe, that, positive, emotions, cognitions, and, relationships, in, romantic, behaviors, all, drive, the, expansion, of, a, person, s, self, concept, a, study, following, college, students, for, 10, weeks, showed, that, those, students, who, fell, in, love, over, the, course, of, the, investigation, reported, higher, feelings, of, self, esteem, and, self, efficacy, than, those, who, did, not, gottman, studies, the, components, of, a, flourishing, romantic, relationship, have, been, studied, in, the, lab, gottman, silver, 1999, he, used, physiological, and, behavioral, measures, during, couples, interactions, to, predict, relationship, success, and, found, that, five, positive, interactions, to, one, negative, interaction, are, needed, to, maintain, a, healthy, relationship, he, established, a, therapy, intervention, for, couples, that, focused, on, civil, forms, of, disapproval, a, culture, of, appreciation, acceptance, of, responsibility, for, problems, and, self, soothing, recent, research, suggests, that, romantic, relationships, impact, daily, behaviors, and, people, are, influenced, by, the, eating, habits, of, their, romantic, partners, specifically, in, the, early, stages, of, romantic, relationships, women, are, more, likely, to, be, influenced, by, the, eating, patterns, i, e, healthiness, unhealthiness, of, men, however, when, romantic, relationships, are, established, men, are, influenced, by, the, eating, patterns, of, women, daniel, canary, from, the, international, encyclopedia, of, marriage, describes, relationship, maintenance, as, at, the, most, basic, level, relational, maintenance, refers, to, a, variety, of, behaviors, used, by, partners, in, an, effort, to, stay, together, maintaining, stability, and, quality, in, a, relationship, is, the, key, to, success, in, a, romantic, relationship, he, says, that, simply, staying, together, is, not, sufficient, instead, the, quality, of, the, relationship, is, important, for, researchers, this, means, examining, behaviors, that, are, linked, to, relational, satisfaction, and, other, indicators, of, quality, canary, suggests, using, the, work, of, john, gottman, an, american, physiologist, best, known, for, his, research, on, marital, stability, for, over, four, decades, serves, as, a, guide, for, predicting, outcomes, in, relationships, because, gottman, emphasizes, behaviors, that, determine, whether, or, not, a, couple, gets, divorced, furthermore, canary, also, uses, the, source, from, stafford, and, canary, a, journal, on, communication, monographs, because, they, created, five, great, strategies, based, on, maintaining, quality, in, a, relationship, the, article, s, strategies, are, to, provide, on, relational, maintenance, steven, mccornack, and, joseph, ortiz, the, authors, of, the, book, choices, connection, state, that, relationship, maintenance, refers, to, the, use, of, communication, behaviors, to, keep, a, relationship, strong, and, to, ensure, that, each, party, continues, to, draw, satisfaction, from, the, relationship, researchers, such, as, feeney, and, noller, question, the, stability, of, attachment, style, across, the, life, span, since, studies, that, measured, attachment, styles, at, time, points, ranging, from, two, weeks, to, eight, months, found, that, one, out, of, four, adults, attachment, style, changed, furthermore, a, study, by, lopez, and, gormley, found, that, attachment, styles, could, change, during, the, first, year, of, college, and, that, changes, to, more, secure, attachment, styles, were, associated, with, adjustments, in, self, confidence, ratings, and, coping, styles, on, the, other, hand, attachment, styles, in, childhood, mirror, the, ones, found, in, adult, romantic, relationships, in, addition, research, has, shown, that, building, interpersonal, connections, strengthens, neural, regulatory, systems, that, are, involved, in, emotions, of, empathy, enjoyment, of, positive, social, events, and, stress, management, providing, evidence, that, early, social, interactions, affect, adult, relationships, another, topic, of, controversy, in, the, field, of, romantic, relationships, is, that, of, domestic, abuse, following, the, theory, that, romantic, love, evolved, as, a, byproduct, of, survival, it, can, be, said, that, in, some, instances, it, has, turned, into, a, maladaptation, oxytocin, ot, is, a, neurophysical, hormone, produced, in, the, brain, it, is, known, to, cause, a, decrease, in, stress, response, it, also, can, cause, an, increase, in, feelings, of, attachment, in, the, beginning, stages, of, a, romantic, relationship, ot, levels, surge, and, then, remain, relatively, stable, over, the, duration, of, the, relationship, the, higher, the, surge, of, ot, the, greater, the, likelihood, is, of, partners, staying, together, it, plays, an, important, role, in, increasing, positive, interpersonal, behaviors, such, as, trust, altruism, empathy, etc, this, response, is, not, universal, and, can, in, fact, cause, the, opposite, to, occur, depending, on, environment, and, individual, individuals, ranked, high, in, rejection, sensitivity, exhibited, aggressive, tendencies, and, decreased, willingness, for, cooperation, indicating, a, link, between, oxytocin, and, relationship, maintenance, the, feelings, associated, with, romantic, love, function, to, ensure, the, greater, reproductive, fitness, of, individuals, the, obligations, of, individuals, in, romantic, relationships, to, preserve, these, bonds, are, based, in, kin, selection, theory, where, by, exhibiting, aggressive, behavior, a, mate, can, use, intimidation, and, dominance, to, ward, off, other, potential, predators, thus, protecting, the, pair, bond, and, their, actual, or, potential, offspring, this, has, however, evolved, to, the, point, where, it, has, become, detrimental, to, the, fitness, of, individuals, what, is, causing, attachment, to, occur, in, a, relationship, is, now, causing, one, partner, to, harm, the, other, in, the, search, for, the, root, of, intimate, partner, violence, ipv, intranasal, oxytocin, was, administered, to, a, control, group, and, a, group, of, participants, with, aggressive, tendencies, participants, were, then, surveyed, on, how, willing, they, were, to, engage, in, five, behaviors, towards, their, romantic, partner, what, they, found, was, that, oxytocin, increased, ipv, inclinations, only, among, the, participants, with, a, predisposition, towards, aggressive, tendencies
