fertility, in, colloquial, terms, refers, the, ability, to, have, offspring, in, demographic, contexts, fertility, refers, to, the, actual, production, of, offspring, rather, than, the, physical, capability, to, reproduce, which, is, termed, fecundity, the, fertility, rate, is, the, average, number, of, children, born, during, an, individual, s, lifetime, in, medicine, fertility, refers, to, the, ability, to, have, children, and, infertility, refers, to, difficulty, in, reproducing, naturally, in, general, infertility, or, subfertility, in, humans, is, defined, as, not, being, able, to, conceive, a, child, after, one, year, or, longer, of, unprotected, sex, the, antithesis, of, fertility, is, infertility, while, the, antithesis, of, fecundity, is, sterility, in, demographic, contexts, fertility, refers, to, the, actual, production, of, offspring, rather, than, the, physical, capability, to, produce, which, is, termed, fecundity, while, fertility, can, be, measured, fecundity, cannot, be, demographers, measure, the, fertility, rate, in, a, variety, of, ways, which, can, be, broadly, broken, into, period, measures, and, cohort, measures, period, measures, refer, to, a, cross, section, of, the, population, in, one, year, cohort, data, on, the, other, hand, follows, the, same, people, over, a, period, of, decades, both, period, and, cohort, measures, are, widely, used, a, parent, s, number, of, children, strongly, correlates, with, the, number, of, children, that, each, person, in, the, next, generation, will, eventually, have, factors, generally, associated, with, increased, fertility, include, religiosity, intention, to, have, children, and, maternal, support, factors, generally, associated, with, decreased, fertility, include, wealth, education, female, labor, participation, urban, residence, cost, of, housing, intelligence, increased, female, age, and, to, a, lesser, degree, increased, male, age, the, three, step, analysis, of, the, fertility, process, was, introduced, by, kingsley, davis, and, judith, blake, in, 1956, and, makes, use, of, three, proximate, determinants, the, economic, analysis, of, fertility, is, part, of, household, economics, a, field, that, has, grown, out, of, the, new, home, economics, influential, economic, analyses, of, fertility, include, becker, 1960, mincer, 1963, and, easterlin, 1969, the, latter, developed, the, easterlin, hypothesis, to, account, for, the, baby, boom, bongaarts, proposed, a, model, where, the, total, fertility, rate, of, a, population, can, be, calculated, from, four, proximate, determinants, and, the, total, fecundity, tf, the, index, of, marriage, cm, the, index, of, contraception, cc, the, index, of, induced, abortion, ca, and, the, index, of, postpartum, infecundability, ci, these, indices, range, from, 0, to, 1, the, higher, the, index, the, higher, it, will, make, the, tfr, for, example, a, population, where, there, are, no, induced, abortions, would, have, a, ca, of, 1, but, a, country, where, everybody, used, infallible, contraception, would, have, a, cc, of, 0, tfr, tf, cm, ci, ca, cc, these, four, indices, can, also, be, used, to, calculate, the, total, marital, fertility, tmfr, and, the, total, natural, fertility, tn, tfr, tmfr, cm, tmfr, tn, cc, ca, tn, tf, ci, in, medicine, the, definition, of, fertility, is, the, capacity, to, establish, a, clinical, pregnancy, women, have, hormonal, cycles, which, determine, when, they, can, achieve, pregnancy, the, cycle, is, approximately, twenty, eight, days, long, with, a, fertile, period, of, five, days, per, cycle, but, can, deviate, greatly, from, this, norm, men, are, fertile, continuously, but, their, sperm, quality, is, affected, by, their, health, frequency, of, ejaculation, and, environmental, factors, fertility, declines, with, age, in, both, sexes, for, women, the, decline, begins, around, the, age, of, 32, and, becomes, precipitous, at, age, 37, for, men, potency, and, sperm, quality, begins, to, decline, around, the, age, of, 40, even, if, an, older, couple, does, manage, to, conceive, a, child, the, pregnancy, will, be, increasingly, difficult, for, the, mother, and, carries, a, higher, risk, of, birth, defects, and, genetic, disorders, for, the, child, pregnancy, rates, for, sexual, intercourse, are, highest, when, it, occurs, every, 1, or, 2, days, or, every, 2, or, 3, days, studies, have, found, no, significant, difference, between, different, sex, positions, and, pregnancy, rate, as, long, as, it, results, in, ejaculation, into, the, vagina, a, woman, s, menstrual, cycle, begins, as, arbitrarily, assigned, with, menses, next, is, the, follicular, phase, where, estrogen, levels, build, as, an, ovum, matures, due, to, the, follicular, stimulating, hormone, or, fsh, within, the, ovary, when, estrogen, levels, peak, it, spurs, a, surge, of, luteinizing, hormone, lh, which, completes, maturation, and, enables, the, ovum, to, break, through, the, ovary, wall, this, is, ovulation, during, the, luteal, phase, following, ovulation, lh, and, fsh, cause, the, post, ovulation, ovary, to, develop, into, the, corpus, luteum, which, produces, progesterone, the, production, of, progesterone, inhibits, the, lh, and, fsh, hormones, which, in, a, cycle, without, pregnancy, causes, the, corpus, luteum, to, atrophy, and, menses, to, begin, the, cycle, again, peak, fertility, occurs, during, just, a, few, days, of, the, cycle, usually, two, days, before, and, two, days, after, the, ovulation, date, this, fertile, window, varies, from, woman, to, woman, just, as, the, ovulation, date, often, varies, from, cycle, to, cycle, for, the, same, woman, the, ovule, is, usually, capable, of, being, fertilized, for, up, to, 48, hours, after, it, is, released, from, the, ovary, sperm, survive, inside, the, uterus, between, 48, and, 72, hours, on, average, with, the, maximum, being, 120, hours, 5, days, these, periods, and, intervals, are, important, factors, for, couples, using, the, rhythm, method, of, contraception, the, average, age, of, menarche, in, the, united, states, is, about, 12, 5, years, in, postmenarchal, girls, about, 80, of, the, cycles, are, anovulatory, ovulation, does, not, actually, take, place, in, the, first, year, after, menarche, 50, in, the, third, and, 10, in, the, sixth, year, menopause, occurs, during, a, woman, s, midlife, between, ages, 48, and, 55, during, menopause, hormonal, production, by, the, ovaries, is, reduced, eventually, causing, a, permanent, cessation, of, the, creation, of, the, uterine, lining, period, this, is, considered, the, end, of, the, fertile, phase, of, a, woman, s, life, the, predicted, effect, of, age, on, female, fertility, in, women, trying, to, get, pregnant, without, using, fertility, drugs, or, in, vitro, fertilization, studies, of, couples, trying, to, conceive, have, yielded, better, results, one, 2004, study, of, 770, european, women, found, that, 82, of, 35, to, 39, year, old, women, conceived, within, a, year, while, a, study, in, 2013, of, 2, 820, danish, women, saw, 78, of, 35, to, 40, year, olds, conceive, within, a, year, according, to, an, opinion, by, the, practice, committee, of, the, american, society, for, reproductive, medicine, specific, coital, timing, or, position, and, resting, supine, after, intercourse, have, no, significant, impact, on, fertility, sperm, can, be, found, in, the, cervical, canal, seconds, after, ejaculation, regardless, of, coital, position, successful, pregnancies, facilitated, by, fertility, treatment, have, been, documented, in, women, as, old, as, 67, some, research, suggests, that, older, males, have, decreased, semen, volume, sperm, motility, and, impaired, sperm, morphology, in, studies, that, controlled, for, female, partner, s, age, comparisons, between, men, under, 30, and, men, over, 50, found, relative, decreases, in, pregnancy, rates, between, 23, and, 38, sperm, count, declines, with, age, with, men, aged, 50, 80, years, producing, sperm, at, an, average, rate, of, 75, compared, with, men, aged, 20, 50, years, and, larger, differences, exist, in, the, number, of, seminiferous, tubules, in, the, testes, containing, mature, sperm, decline, in, male, fertility, is, influenced, by, many, factors, including, lifestyle, environment, and, psychological, factors, some, research, suggests, increased, risks, for, health, problems, for, children, of, older, fathers, but, no, clear, association, has, been, proven, a, large, scale, study, in, israel, suggested, that, the, children, of, men, 40, or, older, were, 5, 75, times, more, likely, than, children, of, men, under, 30, to, have, an, autism, spectrum, disorder, controlling, for, year, of, birth, socioeconomic, status, and, maternal, age, increased, paternal, age, has, been, suggested, to, correlate, with, schizophrenia, but, it, is, unproven, australian, researchers, have, found, evidence, to, suggest, obesity, may, cause, subtle, damage, to, sperm, and, prevent, a, healthy, pregnancy, they, reported, fertilization, was, 40, less, successful, when, the, father, was, overweight, the, american, fertility, society, recommends, an, age, limit, for, sperm, donors, of, 50, years, or, less, and, many, fertility, clinics, in, the, united, kingdom, will, not, accept, donations, from, men, over, 40, or, 45, years, of, age, the, french, pronatalist, movement, from, 1919, to, 1945, failed, to, convince, french, couples, they, had, a, patriotic, duty, to, help, increase, their, country, s, birthrate, even, the, government, was, reluctant, in, its, support, to, the, movement, it, was, only, between, 1938, and, 1939, that, the, french, government, became, directly, and, permanently, involved, in, the, pronatalist, effort, although, the, birthrate, started, to, surge, in, late, 1941, the, trend, was, not, sustained, falling, birthrate, once, again, became, a, major, concern, among, demographers, and, government, officials, beginning, in, the, 1970s, in, mid, 2018, there, was, a, bill, introduced, to, legalize, single, women, and, lesbian, couples, to, get, fertility, treatment, at, the, beginning, of, 2020, the, senate, approved, the, bill, 160, votes, to, 116, they, are, a, step, closer, to, legalizing, fertility, treatments, for, all, women, regardless, of, sexual, orientation, or, marital, status, soon, there, will, be, no, reason, for, lesbian, couples, or, single, women, to, travel, to, be, able, to, start, their, own, family, south, korea, has, the, lowest, fertility, rate, in, the, world, at, 0, 78, a, variety, of, explanations, have, been, proposed, ranging, from, investment, in, education, to, birth, control, abortion, a, decline, in, the, marriage, rate, divorce, female, participation, in, the, labor, force, and, the, 1997, asian, financial, crisis, after, being, legal, from, the, 1960s, to, the, 1980s, abortion, was, again, made, illegal, in, south, korea, in, the, early, 2000s, in, an, attempt, to, reverse, the, declining, fertility, rate, from, 1800, to, 1940, fertility, fell, in, the, us, there, was, a, marked, decline, in, fertility, in, the, early, 1900s, associated, with, improved, contraceptives, greater, access, to, contraceptives, and, sexuality, information, and, the, first, sexual, revolution, in, the, 1920s, after, 1940, fertility, suddenly, started, going, up, again, reaching, a, new, peak, in, 1957, after, 1960, fertility, started, declining, rapidly, in, the, baby, boom, years, 1946, 1964, women, married, earlier, and, had, their, babies, sooner, the, number, of, children, born, to, mothers, after, age, 35, did, not, increase, after, 1960, new, methods, of, contraception, became, available, ideal, family, size, fell, from, 3, to, 2, children, couples, postponed, marriage, and, first, births, and, they, sharply, reduced, the, number, of, third, and,
