cider, s, a, d, r, sy, d, r, is, an, alcoholic, beverage, made, from, the, fermented, juice, of, apples, cider, is, widely, available, in, the, united, kingdom, particularly, in, the, west, country, and, ireland, the, uk, has, the, world, s, highest, per, capita, consumption, as, well, as, the, largest, cider, producing, companies, ciders, from, the, south, west, of, england, are, generally, higher, in, alcoholic, content, cider, is, also, popular, in, many, commonwealth, countries, such, as, india, south, africa, canada, australia, new, zealand, and, new, england, as, well, as, the, uk, and, its, former, colonies, cider, is, popular, in, portugal, mainly, in, minho, and, madeira, france, particularly, normandy, and, brittany, friuli, and, northern, spain, specifically, asturias, and, basque, country, germany, also, has, its, own, types, of, cider, with, rhineland, palatinate, and, hesse, producing, a, particularly, tart, version, known, as, apfelwein, in, the, u, s, and, canada, varieties, of, alcoholic, cider, are, often, called, hard, cider, to, distinguish, it, from, non, alcoholic, apple, cider, or, sweet, cider, also, made, from, apples, in, canada, cider, cannot, contain, less, than, 2, 5, or, over, 13, absolute, alcohol, by, volume, the, juice, of, most, varieties, of, apple, including, crab, apples, can, be, used, to, make, cider, but, cider, apples, are, best, the, addition, of, sugar, or, extra, fruit, before, a, second, fermentation, increases, the, ethanol, content, of, the, resulting, beverage, cider, alcohol, content, varies, from, 1, 2, to, 8, 5, abv, or, more, in, traditional, english, ciders, and, 3, 5, to, 12, in, continental, ciders, in, uk, law, it, must, contain, at, least, 35, apple, juice, fresh, or, from, concentrate, although, camra, the, campaign, for, real, ale, says, that, real, cider, must, be, at, least, 90, fresh, apple, juice, in, the, us, there, is, a, 50, minimum, in, france, cider, must, be, made, solely, from, apples, perry, is, a, similar, product, to, cider, made, by, fermenting, pear, juice, when, distilled, cider, turns, into, fruit, brandy, the, flavour, of, cider, varies, ciders, can, be, classified, from, dry, to, sweet, their, appearance, ranges, from, cloudy, with, sediment, to, completely, clear, and, their, colour, ranges, from, almost, colourless, to, amber, to, brown, the, variations, in, clarity, and, colour, are, mostly, due, to, filtering, between, pressing, and, fermentation, some, apple, varieties, will, produce, a, clear, cider, without, any, need, for, filtration, both, sparkling, and, still, ciders, are, made, the, sparkling, variety, is, the, more, common, modern, mass, produced, ciders, closely, resemble, sparkling, wine, in, appearance, more, traditional, brands, tend, to, be, darker, and, cloudier, they, are, often, stronger, than, the, mass, produced, varieties, and, taste, more, strongly, of, apples, almost, colourless, white, cider, has, the, same, apple, juice, content, as, conventional, cider, but, is, harder, to, create, because, the, cider, maker, has, to, blend, various, apples, to, create, a, clearer, liquid, white, ciders, tend, to, be, sweeter, and, more, refreshing, they, are, typically, 7, 8, abv, in, strength, black, cider, by, contrast, is, dry, amber, cider, which, has, an, alcohol, content, of, 7, 8, abv, the, word, cider, is, first, mentioned, in, middle, english, in, biblical, use, as, sicer, ciser, strong, drink, strong, liquor, in, the, 13th, century, and, as, sither, e, cidre, liquor, made, from, the, juice, of, fruits, beverage, made, from, apples, in, the, 14th, century, it, was, probably, first, borrowed, from, old, french, primitive, form, sizre, fermented, beverage, eadwine, psalter, lxviii, 14, and, then, from, another, younger, french, form, cistre, later, sidre, cidre, beverage, made, from, fruits, the, specific, meaning, fermented, beverage, from, apples, appears, in, old, french, for, the, first, time, by, the, norman, chronicler, wace, in, 1130, 1140, wace, conception, de, nostre, dame, the, old, french, word, cisre, sizre, is, from, gallo, romance, cisera, found, in, medieval, latin, by, the, english, author, alexander, neckam, neckam, de, nominibus, utensilium, it, is, an, altered, form, of, church, latin, sicera, fermented, drink, itself, borrowed, from, greek, s, k, ra, ultimately, from, hebrew, k, r, intoxicating, liquor, the, cognates, in, the, different, romance, languages, spanish, portuguese, sidra, italian, sidro, etc, in, the, germanic, languages, german, zider, etc, are, all, from, french, and, breton, chistr, welsh, seidr, through, an, english, form, probably, too, by, the, 19th, century, cider, referred, to, the, expressed, juice, of, apples, either, before, fermentation, as, sweet, cider, or, after, fermentation, a, hard, cider, cider, is, an, ancient, beverage, the, first, recorded, reference, to, cider, dates, back, to, julius, caesar, s, first, attempt, to, invade, britain, in, 55, bce, where, he, found, the, native, celts, fermenting, crabapples, he, would, take, the, discovery, back, through, continental, europe, with, his, retreating, troops, in, the, cider, market, ciders, can, be, broken, down, into, two, main, styles, standard, and, specialty, the, first, group, consists, of, modern, ciders, and, heritage, ciders, modern, ciders, are, produced, from, culinary, apples, such, as, gala, heritage, ciders, are, produced, from, heritage, cider, specific, crab, or, wild, apples, like, golden, russet, historically, cider, was, made, from, the, only, resources, available, to, make, it, so, style, was, not, a, large, factor, when, considering, the, production, process, apples, were, historically, confined, to, the, cooler, climates, of, western, europe, and, britain, where, civilisation, was, slow, to, develop, record, keeping, cider, was, first, made, from, crab, apples, ancestors, of, the, bittersweet, and, bittersharp, apples, used, by, today, s, english, cider, makers, english, cider, contained, a, drier, higher, alcohol, content, version, using, open, fermentation, vats, and, bittersweet, crab, apples, the, french, developed, a, sweet, low, alcohol, cidre, taking, advantage, of, the, sweeter, apples, and, the, keeving, process, cider, styles, evolved, based, on, the, methods, used, the, apples, available, and, local, tastes, production, techniques, developed, as, with, most, technology, by, trial, and, error, in, fact, the, variables, were, nearly, too, widespread, to, track, including, spontaneous, fermentation, the, type, of, vessels, used, environmental, conditions, and, the, apple, varieties, refinements, came, much, later, when, cider, became, a, commercial, product, and, the, process, was, better, understood, however, since, there, is, growing, popularity, in, ciders, the, production, of, specialty, styles, has, begun, to, increase, modern, ciders, are, made, from, culinary, apples, and, are, lower, in, tannins, and, higher, in, acidity, than, other, cider, styles, common, culinary, apples, used, in, modern, ciders, include, mcintosh, golden, delicious, jonagold, granny, smith, gala, and, fuji, a, sweet, or, low, alcohol, cider, may, tend, to, have, a, strong, aromatic, and, flavour, character, of, apple, while, drier, and, higher, alcohol, ciders, will, tend, to, produce, a, wider, range, of, fruity, aromas, and, flavours, modern, ciders, vary, in, color, from, pale, to, yellow, and, can, range, from, brilliant, to, a, hazy, clarity, clarity, can, be, altered, through, various, cider, making, practices, depending, on, the, cider, maker, s, intentions, heritage, ciders, are, made, from, both, culinary, and, cider, apples, including, bittersweet, bittersharp, heirlooms, wild, apples, and, crabapples, common, apples, used, in, heritage, cider, production, include, dabinett, kingston, black, roxbury, russet, and, wickson, heritage, ciders, are, higher, in, tannins, than, modern, ciders, they, range, in, colour, from, yellow, to, amber, ranging, from, brilliant, to, hazy, clarity, of, heritage, ciders, also, depends, on, the, cider, making, practices, used, and, will, differ, by, cider, maker, as, well, in, canada, some, cideries, market, loyalist, style, ciders, which, are, notably, dry, and, made, with, mcintosh, apples, a, canadian, heritage, varietal, specialty, style, ciders, are, open, to, a, lot, more, manipulation, than, modern, or, heritage, style, ciders, there, is, no, restriction, to, apple, varieties, used, and, the, list, of, specialty, styles, continues, to, expand, listed, on, the, usacm, cider, style, guide, specialty, styles, include, fruit, hopped, spiced, wood, aged, sour, and, iced, ciders, fruit, ciders, have, other, fruit, or, juices, added, before, or, after, fermentation, such, as, cherries, blueberries, and, cranberries, hopped, cider, is, fermented, with, added, hops, common, hop, varieties, being, cascade, citra, galaxy, and, mosaic, spiced, ciders, have, various, spices, added, to, the, cider, before, during, or, after, fermentation, spices, like, cinnamon, and, ginger, are, popular, to, use, in, production, wood, aged, ciders, are, ciders, that, are, either, fermented, or, aged, in, various, types, of, wood, barrels, to, aid, in, extraction, of, woody, earthy, flavours, sour, ciders, are, high, acid, ciders, that, are, produced, with, non, standard, non, saccharomyces, yeast, and, bacteria, which, enhance, acetic, and, lactic, acid, production, to, reach, a, sour, profile, ice, ciders, can, be, made, by, using, pre, pressed, frozen, juice, or, frozen, whole, apples, whole, apples, either, come, frozen, from, the, orchard, dependent, on, harvest, date, or, are, stored, in, a, freezer, prior, to, pressing, when, the, pre, pressed, juice, or, whole, apples, freeze, sugars, are, concentrated, and, mostly, separated, from, the, water, whole, apples, are, then, pressed, to, extract, the, concentrated, juice, for, the, pre, pressed, juice, the, concentrated, solution, is, drawn, off, while, thawing, occurs, although, according, to, the, alcohol, and, tobacco, tax, and, trade, bureau, ttb, cider, producers, can, only, label, a, product, ice, cider, if, it, is, produced, from, apples, naturally, frozen, outdoors, two, styles, not, mentioned, in, the, usacm, cider, style, guide, are, ros, and, sparkling, cider, ros, cider, can, be, produced, from, apple, varieties, that, have, reddish, pink, pulp, like, pink, pearl, and, amour, rouge, ros, ciders, can, also, be, created, through, the, addition, of, food, grade, red, dyes, previously, used, red, grape, skins, like, marquette, with, high, anthocyanin, concentration, red, fruits, rose, petals, or, hibiscus, lastly, sparkling, ciders, can, be, produced, through, methods, of, direct, carbonation, addition, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, or, by, m, thode, champenoise, to, re, create, the, traditional, champagne, style, apples, grown, for, consumption, are, suitable, for, cider, making, though, some, regional, cider, makers, prefer, to, use, a, mix, of, eating, and, cider, apples, as, in, kent, england, or, exclusively, cider, apples, as, in, the, west, country, england, and, west, of, england, there, are, many, hundreds, of, varieties, of, cultivars, developed, specifically, for, cider, making, once, the, apples, are, gathered, from, trees, in, orchards, they, are, scratted, ground, down, into, a, pulp, historically, this, was, done, using, pressing, stones, with, circular, troughs, or, by, a, cider, mill, cider, mills, were, traditionally, driven, by, the, hand, water, mill, or, horse, power, in, modern, times, they, are, likely, to, be, powered, by, electricity, the, pulp, is, then, transferred, to, a, cider, press, where, the, juice, is, extracted, traditionally, the, method, for, squeezing, the, juice, from, the, apple, pulp, involves, placing, sweet, straw, or, haircloths, between, stacked, layers, of, apple, pulp, today, apples, can, be, quickly, pressed, on, a, mechanized, belt, press, the, juice, after, being, strained, in, a, coarse, hair, sieve, is, then, put, into, either, open, vats, or, closed, casks, the, remaining, solids, pomace, are, given, to, farm, animals, as, winter, feed, composted, discarded, or, used, to, make, liqueurs, fermentation, of, ciders, occurs, by, a, very, similar, mechanism, to, the, fermentation, of, wine, the, process, of, alcoholic, fermentation, is, characterised, by, the, conversion, of, simple, sugars, into, ethanol, by, yeasts, especially, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, this, is, because, as, crabtree, positive, yeasts, they, produce, ethanol, even, during, aerobic, fermentation, in, contrast, crabtree, negative, yeasts, produce, only, biomass, and, carbon, dioxide, this, adaptation, allows, them, a, competitive, edge, in, the, fermentation, of, ciders, due, to, their, high, alcohol, tolerance, and, because, of, this, tolerance, it, is, common, for, ciders, to, be, fermented, to, dryness, although, that, is, not, always, the, case, fermentations, will, carry, on, until, the, fermentation, is, stopped, or, the, yeasts, run, out, of, nutrients, and, can, no, longer, metabolise, resulting, in, a, stuck, fermentation, steps, taken, before, fermentation, might, include, fruit, or, juice, blending, titratable, acidity, and, ph, measurements, and, sometimes, adjustments, and, sulfur, dioxide, and, yeast, additions, fermentation, is, carried, out, at, a, temperature, of, 4, 16, c, 39, 61, f, this, temperature, would, be, low, for, most, kinds, of, fermentation, but, is, beneficial, for, cider, as, it, leads, to, slower, fermentation, with, less, loss, of, delicate, aromas, fermentation, can, occur, due, to, natural, yeasts, that, are, present, in, the, must, alternately, some, cider, makers, add, cultivated, strains, of, cider, yeast, such, as, saccharomyces, bayanus, during, the, initial, stages, of, fermentation, there, are, elevated, levels, of, carbon, dioxide, as, the, yeasts, multiply, and, begin, to, break, down, the, sugar, into, ethanol, in, addition, to, fermentative, metabolism, of, yeast, certain, organoleptic, compounds, are, formed, that, have, an, effect, on, the, quality, of, cider, such, as, other, alcohols, esters, and, other, volatile, compounds, after, fermentation, racking, occurs, into, a, clean, vessel, trying, to, leave, behind, as, much, yeast, as, possible, shortly, before, the, fermentation, consumes, all, the, sugar, the, liquor, is, racked, siphoned, into, new, vats, this, leaves, dead, yeast, cells, and, other, undesirable, material, at, the, bottom, of, the, old, vat, at, this, point, it, becomes, important, to, exclude, airborne, acetic, bacteria, so, vats, are, filled, completely, to, exclude, air, the, fermenting, of, the, remaining, available, sugar, generates, a, small, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, that, forms, a, protective, layer, reducing, air, contact, this, final, fermentation, creates, a, small, amount, of, carbonation, extra, sugar, may, be, added, specifically, for, this, purpose, racking, is, sometimes, repeated, if, the, liquor, remains, too, cloudy, apple, based, juice, may, also, be, combined, with, fruit, to, make, a, fine, cider, fruit, pur, es, or, flavourings, can, be, added, such, as, grape, cherry, raspberry, or, cranberry, the, cider, is, ready, to, drink, after, a, three, month, fermentation, period, although, it, is, more, often, matured, in, the, vats, for, up, to, three, years, for, larger, scale, cider, production, ciders, from, vats, produced, from, different, varieties, of, apple, may, be, blended, to, accord, with, market, taste, if, the, cider, is, to, be, bottled, usually, some, extra, sugar, is, added, for, sparkle, higher, quality, ciders, can, be, made, using, the, champagne, method, but, this, is, expensive, in, time, and, money, and, requires, special, corks, bottles, and, other, equipment, some, home, brewers, use, beer, bottles, which, work, perfectly, well, and, are, inexpensive, this, allows, the, cider, to, become, naturally, carbonated, tannins, are, crucial, flavour, compounds, in, cider, since, perfecting, the, tannin, content, in, the, cider, is, needed, for, optimal, success, the, tannins, or, polyphenols, of, apples, are, largely, implicated, in, cider, quality, they, are, important, because, they, control, the, astringency, and, bitterness, of, the, cider, tannins, are, necessary, components, to, focus, on, when, producing, cider, because, the, length, of, the, aftertaste, of, the, cider, astringency, and, bitterness, are, both, strong, chemicals, that, affect, people, s, opinion, on, the, cider, tannins, are, polyphenol, compounds, that, are, naturally, occurring, in, apples, depending, on, the, type, of, cider, apple, the, producer, is, using, the, tannin, levels, will, be, different, the, more, well, known, ciders, typically, have, lower, tannin, levels, while, traditional, ciders, have, more, one, example, of, a, common, tannin, present, in, cider, is, procyanidin, b2, the, acids, in, cider, play, a, vital, role, in, both, the, cider, making, process, and, in, the, final, flavour, of, a, finished, cider, they, are, present, in, both, apples, and, cider, and, add, a, sour, taste, and, a, pungent, odor, to, these, respective, substances, acids, also, serve, as, a, preservative, in, the, cider, since, microbes, grow, less, in, lower, ph, environments, and, contribute, to, the, fermentation, process, most, ciders, have, a, ph, of, between, 3, 3, and, 4, 1, the, primary, acid, found, in, apples, is, malic, acid, which, accounts, for, around, 90, of, the, acid, content, in, apples, malic, acid, contributes, to, the, tart, and, sour, flavours, found, in, cider, and, typically, between, 4, 5, and, 7, 5, grams, of, malic, acid, per, litre, of, cider, is, preferred, malic, acid, is, also, used, to, determine, apple, ripeness, for, harvesting, as, its, concentration, decreases, as, the, fruit, ripens, lactic, acid, is, also, commonly, found, in, cider, and, it, is, mainly, formed, from, malo, lactic, fermentation, a, process, that, converts, malic, acid, into, lactic, acid, this, process, rounds, out, the, flavour, of, the, cider, while, reducing, a, lot, of, the, acidity, and, producing, carbon, dioxide, as, well, other, acids, such, as, citric, acid, can, be, used, to, add, taste, after, fermentation, but, these, acids, are, not, typically, found, in, high, concentration, in, apples, naturally, most, of, the, natural, sugar, in, apples, are, used, up, in, the, fermentation, process, and, are, converted, into, alcohol, and, carbon, dioxide, if, the, fermentation, goes, all, the, way, the, cider, will, have, no, perceivable, residual, sugar, and, be, dry, this, means, that, the, cider, will, not, taste, sweet, and, might, show, more, bitterness, or, acidity, ciders, are, made, in, many, parts, of, europe, and, in, the, united, states, and, each, country, has, different, representations, of, cider, with, different, flavour, compounds, keeving, is, a, traditional, method, of, fermentation, with, low, amounts, of, nitrogen, in, french, and, english, ciders, that, is, intended, to, slow, down, the, rate, of, fermentation, in, hopes, of, retaining, high, esters, as, well, as, retaining, some, residual, sugar, in, the, bottled, cider, to, increase, effervescence, in, the, aging, process, ciders, can, be, back, sweetened, after, fermentation, is, complete, to, add, a, sweet, taste, and, balance, out, acids, tannins, and, bitterness, natural, sugar, can, be, used, but, this, can, restart, fermentation, in, a, bottle, if, not, filtered, correctly, artificial, sweeteners, can, be, used, which, are, non, fermentable, but, some, of, these, create, an, aftertaste, such, as, saccharin, or, sucralose, yet, some, of, these, are, known, for, adding, off, flavour, compounds, in, 2014, a, study, found, that, a, 1, us, pint, 470, ml, bottle, of, mass, market, cider, contained, 20, 5, g, five, teaspoons, of, sugar, nearly, the, amount, the, who, recommends, as, an, adult, s, daily, allowance, of, added, sugar, and, 5, 10, times, the, amount, of, sugar, in, lager, or, ale, an, important, component, in, cider, making, is, the, addition, of, sulfur, dioxide, to, inhibit, the, growth, of, many, spoilage, bacteria, or, yeasts, in, the, juice, this, encourages, the, inoculated, yeast, to, dominate, the, juice, environment, converting, sugars, to, alcohol, once, sulfur, dioxide, dissolves, in, the, juice, it, converts, into, a, ph, dependent, mixture, of, bisulfite, sulfite, ions, and, molecular, sulfur, dioxide, the, unbound, sulfur, dioxide, provides, the, antimicrobial, environment, in, the, juice, while, the, bisulfite, and, sulfite, ions, contribute, to, flavour, the, quantity, of, sulfur, dioxide, needed, to, inhibit, microbial, activity, is, directly, related, to, the, ph, of, the, juice, lower, ph, means, less, should, be, added, while, higher, ph, juice, requires, more, many, cider, producers, add, sulfur, dioxide, immediately, after, pressing, and, juicing, but, before, fermentation, however, in, some, cases, it, can, be, added, afterwards, to, act, as, an, antioxidant, or, stabiliser, this, prevents, the, finished, cider, from, releasing, hydrogen, peroxide, or, aldehydes, that, produce, off, odors, and, flavours, nitrogen, is, also, a, very, important, nutrient, supporting, yeast, growth, and, fermentation, in, cider, yeast, require, different, forms, of, nitrogen, to, take, up, and, use, themselves, so, nitrogenous, compounds, are, often, added, to, apple, juice, the, mixture, of, nitrogen, containing, compounds, that, yeast, can, use, are, referred, to, as, yeast, assimilable, nitrogen, or, yan, even, though, yan, can, be, added, into, juice, before, fermentation, there, are, other, ways, to, affect, the, levels, of, nitrogen, in, the, juice, before, pressing, like, the, maturity, of, the, orchard, or, what, type, of, fertiliser, is, used, using, a, fertiliser, with, a, good, amount, of, nitrogen, will, help, the, roots, of, apple, trees, nitrogen, fixing, bacteria, on, the, roots, will, be, able, to, provide, the, tree, with, more, nitrogen, that, will, be, able, to, make, its, way, into, the, fruit, a, low, crop, load, can, also, yield, juices, with, more, yan, than, a, high, crop, load, because, the, nitrogen, in, more, concentrated, in, the, low, number, of, apples, instead, of, being, distributed, to, many, apples, while, a, sufficient, amount, of, yan, is, good, for, the, yeast, and, ensures, fermentation, of, the, sugars, in, the, juice, to, alcohol, some, cider, makers, may, choose, to, limit, nitrogen, because, it, is, the, limiting, factor, when, the, yeast, are, starved, for, nitrogen, they, stop, fermenting, and, die, off, this, can, be, desirable, if, cider, makers, prefer, their, cider, to, have, some, more, sugar, than, alcohol, in, their, cider, however, limiting, yan, should, be, done, in, moderation, because, too, little, nitrogen, can, lead, to, an, increase, in, hydrogen, sulfide, h, 2, s, production, which, is, responsible, for, a, rotten, egg, like, smell, primary, cider, fermentation, can, be, initiated, by, inoculating, the, cider, must, with, selected, yeast, strains, or, by, permitting, indigenous, yeast, strains, present, on, the, fruit, and, in, the, cider, production, equipment, to, spontaneously, commence, fermentation, without, inoculation, inoculation, with, different, strains, of, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, and, other, yeast, strains, with, strong, fermentative, metabolism, traits, including, saccharomyces, bayanus, and, torulaspora, delbrueckii, strains, has, been, shown, to, produce, few, differences, in, cider, phenolic, compounds, save, for, concentrations, of, phloretin, see, phloretin, in, samples, that, underwent, malolactic, fermentation, spontaneous, fermentation, commenced, by, indigenous, yeasts, and, finished, by, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, can, produce, ciders, with, similar, concentrations, of, important, non, volatile, acids, including, lactic, acid, succinic, acid, and, acetic, acid, while, concentrations, of, volatile, compounds, such, as, methanol, and, 1, butanol, were, present, in, different, concentrations, dependent, on, apple, cultivar, extending, the, time, during, which, the, cider, remains, in, contact, with, yeast, lees, increased, concentrations, of, most, of, the, minor, volatile, compounds, present, especially, fatty, acids, ethyl, esters, and, alcohols, major, volatile, compound, concentrations, did, not, exhibit, a, similar, pattern, with, iso, butanol, amyl, alcohols, and, acetone, decreasing, 1, propanol, decreasing, sparkling, ciders, can, be, produced, using, different, methods, including, the, champenoise, method, used, to, produce, champagne, use, of, different, strains, of, indigenous, saccharomyces, to, perform, secondary, fermentation, produced, ciders, with, consistent, alcohol, and, acidic, characteristics, variable, glycerol, acetaldehyde, ethyl, acetate, methanol, propanol, i, butanol, and, 2, phenylethanol, characteristics, and, acceptable, sensory, analysis, results, the, selection, of, yeast, used, for, cider, production, is, critical, to, the, quality, of, the, final, product, as, with, other, fermented, beverages, like, wine, and, beer, the, strain, of, yeast, used, to, carry, out, the, alcoholic, fermentation, also, converts, precursor, molecules, into, the, odorants, found, in, the, final, product, in, general, two, broad, categories, of, yeast, are, used, for, cider, making, commercially, developed, strains, and, wild, or, autochthonous, strains, in, either, case, the, species, tend, to, be, either, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, or, saccharomyces, bayanus, commercial, strains, are, available, for, purchase, from, numerous, distributors, and, their, characteristics, are, typically, outlined, in, manuals, from, the, companies, selection, for, fermentation, may, be, based, on, a, yeast, s, ability, to, ferment, at, particular, sugar, concentrations, temperatures, or, ph, some, producers, may, also, select, for, yeasts, that, produce, killer, factors, allowing, them, to, out, compete, other, yeast, in, the, juice, or, they, may, select, yeast, that, contribute, mouthfeel, or, specific, aromas, to, the, cider, wild, fermentations,

and, commonly, include, species, of, saccharomyces, candida, pichia, hanseniaspora, and, metschnikowia, typically, the, native, yeast, take, up, residence, in, the, cidery, and, can, be, important, to, the, unique, flavour, of, the, product, although, it, was, once, believed, that, the, native, yeast, carrying, out, these, spontaneous, fermentations, also, came, from, the, orchard, itself, research, has, shown, that, the, microbes, cultured, from, apples, in, the, orchard, do, not, align, with, the, microbes, found, during, the, various, stages, of, fermentation, suggesting, that, the,

cider, yeast, may, also, play, other, roles, in, cider, production, the, production, of, sparkling, cider, requires, a, second, round, of, fermentation, and, a, second, yeast, selection, the, yeast, used, for, the, secondary, fermentation, in, sparkling, cider, production, serve, the, same, purpose, as, the, yeast, used, in, the, champagne, method, of, sparkling, wine, production, to, generate, carbonation, and, distinct, aromas, with, a, fermentation, that, occurs, in, the, bottle, the, yeast, is, selected, based, on, critical, properties, such, as, tolerance, to, high, pressure, low, temperature, and, high, ethanol, concentration, as, well, as, an, ability, to, flocculate, which, allows, for, riddling, to, remove, the, yeast, when, the, fermentation, has, finished, some, researchers, have, also, suggested, that, non, saccharomyces, yeasts, could, be, used, to, release, additional, flavour, or, mouthfeel, compounds, as, they, may, contain, enzymes, such, as, glucosidase, xylosidase, or, polygalacturonase, which, saccharomyces, yeast, may, not, produce, not, all, yeast, associated, with, cider, production, are, necessary, for, fermentation, many, are, considered, spoilage, microbes, and, can, be, a, significant, source, of, off, odors, in, the, finished, product, brettanomyces, species, produce, volatile, phenols, especially, 4, ethyl, phenol, which, impart, a, distinct, aroma, called, bretty, typically, described, as, barnyard, horsey, or, bandaid, while, these, aromas, would, be, considered, spoilage, odors, in, wines, many, cider, producers, and, consumers, do, not, consider, them, a, fault, yeast, species, like, hanseniaspora, uvarum, metschnikowia, pulcherrima, saccharomyces, uvarum, zygosaccharomyces, cidri, candida, pomicole, and, pichia, membranifaciens, have, also, been, found, to, produce, enzymes, linked, to, generation, of, spoilage, odors, the, western, british, tradition, of, wassailing, the, apple, trees, and, making, an, offering, of, cider, and, bread, in, autumn, to, protect, the, fertility, of, the, orchard, appears, to, be, a, relatively, ancient, tradition, superficially, dating, back, to, the, pre, christian, early, medieval, period, the, autumn, tradition, of, bobbing, for, apples, is, due, to, the, abundance, of, fruit, at, this, time, a, modern, cider, festival, is, an, organised, event,

than, 80, of, the, whole, production, of, spain, the, consumption, of, cider, in, asturias, is, of, 54, litres, per, person, year, probably, the, highest, in, any, european, region, the, first,

varieties, traditionally, it, is, served, in, sidrer, as, and, chigres, pubs, specialising, in, cider, where, it, is, also, possible, to, have, other, drinks, as, well, as, traditional, food, one, of, the, most, outstanding, characteristics, is, that, it, is, poured, in, very, small, quantities, from, a, height, into, a, wide, glass, with, the, arm, holding, the, bottle, extended, upwards, and, the, one, holding, the, glass, extended, downward, this, technique, is, called, escanciar, un, cul, n, also, echar, un, cul, n, and, is, done, to, get, air, bubbles, into, the, drink, espalmar, thus, giving, it, a, sparkling, taste, like, champagne, that, lasts, a, very, short, time, cider, is, also, poured, from, barrels, in, the, traditional, espichas, one, of, the, most, popular, ciders, in, spain, is, called, el, gaitero, the, bagpipe, player, which, can, be, found, everywhere, in, spain, and, which, is, produced, in, this, region, however, it, must, not, be, confused, with, the, traditional, asturian, cider, as, it, is, a, sparkling, cider, more, in, the, way, of, french, ciders, it, is, a, factory, produced, cider, sweet, and, very, foamy, much, like, lambrusco, different, from, the, more, artisan, and, traditional, cider, productions, recently, new, apple, tree, plantations, have, been, started, in, grounds, belonging, to, the, old, coal, mines, once, important, in, asturias, cider, has, also, been, popular, in, the, basque, country, for, centuries, while, txakoli, and, rioja, wines, became, more, popular, in, biscay, lava, and, navarre, during, the, 19th, century, there, is, still, a, strong, basque, cider, culture, in, gipuzkoa, from, the, 1980s, government, and, gastronomic, associations, have, worked, to, revive, this, culture, in, all, basque, regions, known, as, sagardoa, ipa, s, a, gardoa, it, is, drunk, either, bottled, or, in, a, cider, house, called, a, sagardotegi, where, it, is, poured, from, barrels, most, of, sagardotegis, are, in,
