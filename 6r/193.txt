fishwife, and, spaewife, after, marriage, it, is, generally, expected, in, many, cultures, that, a, woman, will, take, her, husband, s, surname, though, this, is, not, universal, a, married, woman, may, indicate, her, marital, status, in, a, number, of, ways, in, western, culture, a, married, woman, would, commonly, wear, a, wedding, ring, but, in, other, cultures, other, markers, of, marital, status, may, be, used, a, married, woman, is, commonly, given, the, title, mrs, but, some, married, women, prefer, to, be, referred, to, as, ms, a, title, which, is, also, used, by, preference, or, when, the, marital, status, of, a, woman, is, unknown, a, woman, on, her, wedding, day, is, usually, described, as, a, bride, occasionally, this, naming, is, considered, appropriate, after, the, wedding, ceremony, or, the, honeymoon, though, she, is, typically, called, a, wife, within, the, marriage, if, she, is, marrying, a, man, her, partner, is, known, as, the, bridegroom, during, the, wedding, and, within, the, marriage, is, called, her, husband, if, she, is, marrying, a, woman, each, partner, is, referred, to, as, a, wife, in, the, older, customs, which, are, still, followed, by, the, roman, catholic, ritual, the, word, bride, actually, means, fianc, e, and, applies, up, to, the, exchange, of, matrimonial, consent, the, actual, marriage, act, from, that, point, even, while, the, rest, of, the, very, ceremony, is, ongoing, the, woman, is, a, wife, and, no, longer, considered, as, a, bride, hence, the, bridal, couple, is, no, longer, referred, to, as, such, but, instead, as, the, newlywed, couple, or, newlyweds, unlike, mother, a, term, that, puts, a, woman, into, the, context, of, her, children, wife, refers, to, the, institutionalized, relation, to, the, other, spouse, in, some, societies, especially, historically, a, concubine, was, a, woman, who, was, in, an, ongoing, usually, matrimonially, oriented, relationship, with, a, man, who, could, not, be, married, to, her, often, due, to, a, difference, in, social, status, the, term, wife, is, most, commonly, applied, to, a, woman, in, a, union, sanctioned, by, law, including, religious, law, but, not, to, a, woman, in, an, informal, cohabitation, relationship, which, may, be, known, as, a, girlfriend, partner, cohabitant, significant, other, concubine, mistress, etc, however, a, woman, in, a, so, called, common, law, marriage, may, describe, herself, as, a, common, law, wife, de, facto, wife, or, simply, a, wife, those, seeking, to, advance, gender, neutrality, may, refer, to, both, marriage, partners, as, spouses, in, response, to, this, naming, change, many, countries, and, societies, are, rewording, their, statute, law, by, replacing, wife, and, husband, with, spouse, a, former, wife, whose, spouse, is, deceased, is, a, widow, the, status, of, a, wife, may, be, terminated, by, divorce, annulment, or, the, death, of, a, spouse, in, the, case, of, divorce, terminology, such, as, a, former, wife, former, wife, or, ex, wife, is, often, used, in, regard, to, annulment, such, terms, are, not, strictly, accurate, this, is, because, annulment, unlike, divorce, is, usually, retroactive, meaning, that, an, annulled, marriage, is, considered, to, be, invalid, from, the, beginning, as, though, it, had, never, taken, place, in, the, case, of, the, death, of, the, other, spouse, the, term, used, is, widow, the, social, status, of, such, women, varies, by, culture, in, some, places, they, may, be, subject, to, potentially, harmful, practices, such, as, widow, inheritance, or, levirate, marriage, or, social, stigmatization, in, some, cultures, the, termination, of, the, status, of, wife, makes, life, itself, meaningless, in, the, case, of, those, cultures, that, practice, sati, a, funeral, ritual, within, some, asian, communities, a, recently, widowed, woman, intentionally, commits, suicide, by, fire, typically, upon, the, husband, s, funeral, pyre, the, legal, rights, of, a, wife, have, been, subject, to, debate, since, the, 19th, century, in, many, jurisdictions, the, subject, was, in, particular, addressed, by, john, stuart, mill, in, the, subjection, of, women, 1869, historically, many, societies, have, given, sets, of, rights, and, obligations, to, husbands, that, differ, vastly, from, the, sets, of, rights, and, obligations, given, to, wives, in, particular, the, control, of, marital, property, inheritance, rights, and, the, right, to, dictate, the, activities, of, children, of, the, marriage, have, typically, been, given, to, male, marital, partners, however, this, practice, was, curtailed, to, a, great, deal, in, many, countries, in, the, twentieth, century, and, more, modern, statutes, tend, to, define, the, rights, and, duties, of, a, spouse, without, reference, to, gender, among, the, last, european, countries, to, establish, full, gender, equality, in, marriage, were, switzerland, greece, spain, and, france, in, the, 1980s, in, various, marriage, laws, around, the, world, however, the, husband, continues, to, have, authority, for, instance, the, civil, code, of, iran, states, in, article, 1105, in, relations, between, husband, and, wife, the, position, of, the, head, of, the, family, is, the, exclusive, right, of, the, husband, in, some, parts, of, the, world, traditional, payments, or, exchanges, are, typically, made, including, the, purpose, of, the, dowry, varies, by, culture, and, has, varied, historically, in, some, cultures, it, was, paid, not, only, to, support, the, establishment, of, a, new, family, but, also, served, as, a, condition, that, if, the, husband, committed, grave, offenses, upon, his, wife, the, dowry, had, to, be, returned, to, the, wife, or, her, family, due, to, this, condition, the, dowry, was, often, made, inalienable, by, the, husband, during, the, marriage, today, dowries, continue, to, be, expected, in, parts, of, south, asia, such, as, india, pakistan, nepal, bangladesh, and, sri, lanka, and, conflicts, related, to, their, payment, sometimes, result, in, violence, such, as, dowry, deaths, and, bride, burning, in, some, cultures, particularly, in, the, anglophone, west, wives, often, change, their, surnames, to, that, of, the, husband, upon, getting, married, for, some, this, is, a, controversial, practice, due, to, its, tie, to, the, historical, doctrine, of, coverture, and, to, the, historically, subordinated, roles, of, wives, others, argue, that, today, this, is, merely, a, harmless, tradition, that, should, be, accepted, as, a, free, choice, some, jurisdictions, consider, this, practice, as, discriminatory, and, contrary, to, women, s, rights, and, have, restricted, or, banned, it, for, example, since, 1983, when, greece, adopted, a, new, marriage, law, which, guaranteed, gender, equality, between, the, spouses, women, in, greece, are, required, to, keep, their, birth, names, for, their, whole, life, traditionally, and, still, in, many, cultures, the, role, of, a, wife, was, closely, tied, to, that, of, a, mother, by, a, strong, expectation, that, a, wife, ought, to, bear, children, while, conversely, an, unmarried, woman, should, not, have, a, child, out, of, wedlock, these, views, have, changed, in, many, parts, of, the, world, children, born, outside, marriage, have, become, more, common, in, many, countries, although, some, wives, in, particular, in, western, countries, choose, not, to, have, children, such, a, choice, is, not, accepted, in, some, parts, of, the, world, in, northern, ghana, for, example, the, payment, of, bride, price, signifies, a, woman, s, requirement, to, bear, children, and, women, using, birth, control, are, at, risk, of, threats, and, coercion, in, addition, some, religions, are, interpreted, as, requiring, children, in, marriage, for, instance, pope, francis, said, in, 2015, that, choosing, not, to, have, children, was, selfish, many, traditions, like, a, dower, dowry, and, bride, price, have, long, traditions, in, antiquity, the, exchange, of, any, item, or, value, goes, back, to, the, oldest, sources, and, the, wedding, ring, likewise, was, always, used, as, a, symbol, for, keeping, faith, to, a, person, in, ancient, rome, the, emperor, augustus, introduced, marriage, legislation, the, lex, papia, poppaea, which, rewarded, marriage, and, childbearing, the, legislation, also, imposed, penalties, on, young, persons, who, failed, to, marry, and, on, those, who, committed, adultery, therefore, marriage, and, childbearing, was, made, law, between, the, ages, of, twenty, five, and, sixty, for, men, and, twenty, and, fifty, for, women, women, who, were, vestal, virgins, were, selected, between, the, ages, of, 6, and, 10, to, serve, as, priestesses, in, the, temple, of, goddess, vesta, in, the, roman, forum, for, 30, years, after, which, time, they, could, marry, noble, women, were, known, to, marry, as, young, as, 12, years, of, age, whereas, women, in, the, lower, classes, were, more, likely, to, marry, slightly, further, into, their, teenage, years, ancient, roman, law, required, brides, to, be, at, least, 12, years, old, a, standard, adopted, by, roman, catholic, canon, law, in, ancient, roman, law, first, marriages, to, brides, aged, 12, 25, required, the, consent, of, the, bride, and, her, father, but, by, the, late, antique, period, roman, law, permitted, women, over, 25, to, marry, without, parental, consent, the, father, had, the, right, and, duty, to, seek, a, good, and, useful, match, for, his, children, and, might, arrange, a, child, s, betrothal, long, before, he, or, she, came, of, age, to, further, the, interests, of, their, birth, families, daughters, of, the, elite, would, marry, into, respectable, families, if, a, daughter, could, prove, the, proposed, husband, to, be, of, bad, character, she, could, legitimately, refuse, the, match, the, age, of, lawful, consent, to, a, marriage, was, 12, for, maidens, and, 14, for, youths, in, late, antiquity, most, roman, women, seem, to, have, married, in, their, late, teens, to, early, twenties, but, noble, women, married, younger, than, those, of, the, lower, classes, and, an, aristocratic, maiden, was, expected, to, be, virgin, until, her, first, marriage, in, late, antiquity, under, roman, law, daughters, inherited, equally, from, their, parents, if, no, will, was, produced, in, addition, roman, law, recognized, wives, property, as, legally, separate, from, husbands, s, property, as, did, some, legal, systems, in, parts, of, europe, and, colonial, latin, america, christian, cultures, claim, to, be, guided, by, the, new, testament, in, regard, to, their, view, on, the, position, of, a, wife, in, society, as, well, as, her, marriage, the, new, testament, condemns, divorce, for, both, men, and, women, 1, cor, 7, 10, 11, and, assumes, monogamy, on, the, part, of, the, husband, the, wife, is, to, have, her, own, husband, and, the, husband, is, to, have, his, own, wife, 1, cor, 7, 2, in, the, medieval, period, this, was, understood, to, mean, that, a, wife, should, not, share, a, husband, with, other, wives, as, a, result, divorce, was, relatively, uncommon, in, the, pre, modern, west, particularly, in, the, medieval, and, early, modern, period, and, husbands, in, the, roman, later, medieval, and, early, modern, period, did, not, publicly, take, more, than, one, wife, in, pre, modern, times, it, was, unusual, to, marry, for, love, alone, although, it, became, an, ideal, in, literature, by, the, early, modern, period, in, the, 12th, century, the, roman, catholic, church, drastically, changed, legal, standards, for, marital, consent, by, allowing, daughters, over, 12, and, sons, over, 14, to, marry, without, their, parents, approval, even, if, their, marriage, was, made, clandestinely, parish, studies, have, confirmed, that, late, medieval, women, did, sometimes, marry, against, their, parents, approval, the, roman, catholic, church, s, policy, of, considering, clandestine, marriages, and, marriages, made, without, parental, consent, to, be, valid, was, controversial, and, in, the, 16th, century, both, the, french, monarchy, and, the, lutheran, church, sought, to, end, these, practices, with, limited, success, the, new, testament, made, no, pronouncements, about, wives, property, rights, which, in, practice, were, influenced, more, by, secular, laws, than, religion, most, influential, in, the, pre, modern, west, was, the, civil, law, except, in, english, speaking, countries, where, english, common, law, emerged, in, the, high, middle, ages, in, addition, local, customary, law, influenced, wives, property, rights, as, a, result, wives, property, rights, in, the, pre, modern, west, varied, widely, from, region, to, region, because, wives, property, rights, and, daughters, inheritance, rights, varied, widely, from, region, to, region, due, to, differing, legal, systems, the, amount, of, property, a, wife, might, own, varied, greatly, under, the, english, common, law, system, which, dates, to, the, later, medieval, period, daughters, and, younger, sons, were, usually, excluded, from, landed, property, if, no, will, was, produced, under, english, common, law, there, was, a, system, where, a, wife, with, a, living, husband, feme, couvert, could, own, little, property, in, her, own, name, unable, to, easily, support, herself, marriage, was, very, important, to, most, women, s, economic, status, this, problem, has, been, dealt, with, extensively, in, literature, where, the, most, important, reason, for, women, s, limited, power, was, the, denial, of, equal, education, and, equal, property, rights, for, females, the, situation, was, assessed, by, the, english, conservative, moralist, sir, william, blackstone, the, husband, and, wife, are, one, and, the, husband, is, the, one, married, women, s, property, rights, in, the, english, speaking, world, improved, with, the, married, women, s, property, act, 1882, and, similar, legal, changes, which, allowed, wives, with, living, husbands, to, own, property, in, their, own, names, until, late, in, the, 20th, century, women, could, in, some, regions, or, times, sue, a, man, for, wreath, money, when, he, took, her, virginity, without, taking, her, as, his, wife, if, a, woman, did, not, want, to, marry, another, option, was, entering, a, convent, as, a, nun, to, become, a, bride, of, christ, a, state, in, which, her, chastity, and, economic, survival, would, be, protected, both, a, wife, and, a, nun, wore, christian, headcovering, which, proclaimed, their, state, of, protection, by, the, rights, of, marriage, much, more, significant, than, the, option, of, becoming, a, nun, was, the, option, of, non, religious, spinsterhood, in, the, west, an, unmarried, woman, a, feme, sole, had, the, right, to, own, property, and, make, contracts, in, her, own, name, as, first, demonstrated, quantitatively, by, john, hajnal, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, percentage, of, non, clerical, western, women, who, never, married, was, typically, as, high, as, 10, 15, a, prevalence, of, female, celibacy, never, yet, documented, for, any, other, major, traditional, civilization, in, addition, early, modern, western, women, married, at, quite, high, ages, typically, mid, to, late, 20s, relative, to, other, major, traditional, cultures, the, high, age, at, first, marriage, for, western, women, has, been, shown, by, many, parish, reconstruction, studies, to, be, a, traditional, western, marriage, pattern, that, dates, back, at, least, as, early, as, the, mid, 16th, century, in, the, 20th, century, the, role, of, the, wife, in, western, marriage, changed, in, two, major, ways, the, first, was, the, breakthrough, from, an, institution, to, companionate, marriage, for, the, first, time, since, the, middle, ages, wives, became, distinct, legal, entities, and, were, allowed, their, own, property, and, allowed, to, sue, until, then, partners, were, a, single, legal, entity, but, only, a, husband, was, allowed, to, exercise, this, right, called, coverture, the, second, change, was, the, drastic, alteration, of, middle, and, upper, class, family, life, when, in, the, 1960s, these, wives, began, to, work, outside, their, home, and, with, the, social, acceptance, of, divorces, the, single, parent, family, and, stepfamily, or, blended, family, as, a, more, individualized, marriage, today, some, women, may, wear, a, wedding, ring, in, order, to, show, her, status, as, a, wife, in, western, countries, today, married, women, usually, have, an, education, a, profession, and, they, or, their, husbands, can, take, time, off, from, their, work, in, a, legally, procured, system, of, ante, natal, care, statutory, maternity, leave, and, they, may, get, maternity, pay, or, a, maternity, allowance, the, status, of, marriage, as, opposed, to, unmarried, pregnant, women, allows, the, spouse, to, be, responsible, for, the, child, and, to, speak, on, behalf, of, their, wife, a, partner, is, also, responsible, for, the, wife, s, child, in, states, where, they, are, automatically, assumed, to, be, the, biological, legal, parent, vice, versa, a, wife, has, more, legal, authority, in, some, cases, when, she, speaks, on, behalf, of, a, spouse, than, she, would, have, if, they, were, not, married, e, g, when, her, spouse, is, in, a, coma, after, an, accident, a, wife, may, have, the, right, of, advocacy, if, they, divorce, she, also, might, receive, or, pay, alimony, see, law, and, divorce, around, the, world, the, effect, of, women, s, income, on, heterosexual, relationships, dynamics, depends, on, several, factors, if, the, couple, has, strong, traditional, values, the, income, of, women, will, affect, men, s, gender, identity, and, affect, their, well, being, if, they, have, strong, liberal, values, the, income, of, a, woman, will, make, the, woman, the, provider, of, the, house, and, put, the, man, in, a, more, domestic, role, however, in, most, cases, a, couple, will, develop, a, mutually, dependent, relationship, where, the, woman, s, income, is, needed, but, at, the, same, time, the, woman, will, do, the, majority, of, the, housework, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1970s, the, traditional, dynamic, was, that, women, performed, domestic, labor, and, that, men, worked, for, income, due, to, the, economic, pressures, in, place, eventually, second, wave, feminism, challenged, this, dynamic, starting, in, the, 1980s, correlations, between, higher, income, of, women, and, higher, rates, of, divorce, began, decreasing, the, economic, independence, theory, establishes, that, if, one, side, of, the, couple, provides, more, than, 60, of, the, total, income, of, the, couple, there, is, a, dependence, effect, therefore, in, recent, decades, women, have, had, a, major, increase, in, their, economic, independence, at, the, same, time, women, have, had, to, wrestle, with, other, economic, decisions, such, as, the, postponement, of, motherhood, in, indo, aryan, languages, a, wife, is, known, as, patni, which, means, a, woman, who, shares, everything, in, this, world, with, her, husband, and, he, does, the, same, including, their, identity, decisions, are, ideally, made, in, mutual, consent, a, wife, usually, takes, care, of, anything, inside, her, household, including, the, family, s, health, the, children, s, education, a, parent, s, needs, the, majority, of, hindu, marriages, in, rural, and, traditional, india, are, arranged, marriages, once, they, find, a, suitable, family, family, of, same, caste, culture, and, financial, status, the, boy, and, the, girl, see, and, talk, to, each, other, to, decide, the, outcome, in, recent, times, however, the, western, culture, has, had, significant, influence, and, the, new, generations, are, more, open, to, the, idea, of, marrying, for, love, indian, law, has, recognized, rape, sexual, emotional, or, verbal, abuse, of, a, woman, by, her, husband, as, crimes, in, hinduism, a, wife, is, known, as, a, patni, or, ardhangini, similar, to, the, better, half, meaning, a, part, of, the, husband, or, his, family, in, hinduism, a, woman, or, man, can, get, married, but, only, have, one, husband, or, wife, respectively, in, india, women, may, wear, vermilion, powder, on, their, foreheads, an, ornament, called, mangalsutra, hindi, which, is, a, form, of, necklace, or, rings, on, their, toes, which, are, not, worn, by, single, women, to, show, their, status, as, married, women, china, s, family, laws, were, changed, by, the, communist, revolution, and, in, 1950, the, people, s, republic, of, china, enacted, a, comprehensive, marriage, law, including, provisions, giving, the, spouses, equal, rights, with, regard, to, ownership, and, management, of, marital, property, in, japan, before, enactment, of, the, meiji, civil, code, of, 1898, all, of, the, woman, s, property, such, as, land, or, money, passed, to, her, husband, except, for, personal, clothing, and, a, mirror, stand, see, women, in, japan, law,
