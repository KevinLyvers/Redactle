a, video, game, also, known, as, a, computer, game, or, just, a, game, is, an, electronic, game, that, involves, interaction, with, a, user, interface, or, input, device, such, as, a, joystick, controller, keyboard, or, motion, sensing, device, to, generate, visual, feedback, from, a, display, device, most, commonly, shown, in, a, video, format, on, a, television, set, computer, monitor, flat, panel, display, or, touchscreen, on, handheld, devices, or, a, virtual, reality, headset, most, modern, video, games, are, audiovisual, with, audio, complement, delivered, through, speakers, or, headphones, and, sometimes, also, with, other, types, of, sensory, feedback, e, g, haptic, technology, that, provides, tactile, sensations, some, video, games, also, allow, microphone, and, webcam, inputs, for, in, game, chatting, and, livestreaming, video, games, are, typically, categorized, according, to, their, hardware, platform, which, traditionally, includes, arcade, video, games, console, games, and, computer, pc, games, the, latter, also, encompasses, lan, games, online, games, and, browser, games, more, recently, the, video, game, industry, has, expanded, onto, mobile, gaming, through, mobile, devices, such, as, smartphones, and, tablet, computers, virtual, and, augmented, reality, systems, and, remote, cloud, gaming, video, games, are, also, classified, into, a, wide, range, of, genres, based, on, their, style, of, gameplay, and, target, audience, the, first, video, game, prototypes, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, were, simple, extensions, of, electronic, games, using, video, like, output, from, large, room, sized, mainframe, computers, the, first, consumer, video, game, was, the, arcade, video, game, computer, space, in, 1971, in, 1972, came, the, iconic, hit, game, pong, and, the, first, home, console, the, magnavox, odyssey, the, industry, grew, quickly, during, the, golden, age, of, arcade, video, games, from, the, late, 1970s, to, early, 1980s, but, suffered, from, the, crash, of, the, north, american, video, game, market, in, 1983, due, to, loss, of, publishing, control, and, saturation, of, the, market, following, the, crash, the, industry, matured, was, dominated, by, japanese, companies, such, as, nintendo, sega, and, sony, and, established, practices, and, methods, around, the, development, and, distribution, of, video, games, to, prevent, a, similar, crash, in, the, future, many, of, which, continue, to, be, followed, in, the, 2000s, the, core, industry, centered, on, aaa, games, leaving, little, room, for, riskier, experimental, games, coupled, with, the, availability, of, the, internet, and, digital, distribution, this, gave, room, for, independent, video, game, development, or, indie, games, to, gain, prominence, into, the, 2010s, since, then, the, commercial, importance, of, the, video, game, industry, has, been, increasing, the, emerging, asian, markets, and, proliferation, of, smartphone, games, in, particular, are, altering, player, demographics, towards, casual, gaming, and, increasing, monetization, by, incorporating, games, as, a, service, today, video, game, development, requires, numerous, interdisciplinary, skills, vision, teamwork, and, liaisons, between, different, parties, including, developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, hardware, manufacturers, and, other, marketers, to, successfully, bring, a, game, to, its, consumers, as, of, 2020, the, global, video, game, market, had, estimated, annual, revenues, of, us, 159, billion, across, hardware, software, and, services, which, is, three, times, the, size, of, the, global, music, industry, and, four, times, that, of, the, film, industry, in, 2019, making, it, a, formidable, heavyweight, across, the, modern, entertainment, industry, the, video, game, market, is, also, a, major, influence, behind, the, electronics, industry, where, personal, computer, component, console, and, peripheral, sales, as, well, as, consumer, demands, for, better, game, performance, have, been, powerful, driving, factors, for, hardware, design, and, innovation, early, video, games, use, interactive, electronic, devices, with, various, display, formats, the, earliest, example, is, from, 1947, a, cathode, ray, tube, amusement, device, was, filed, for, a, patent, on, 25, january, 1947, by, thomas, t, goldsmith, jr, and, estle, ray, mann, and, issued, on, 14, december, 1948, as, u, s, patent, 2455992, inspired, by, radar, display, technology, it, consists, of, an, analog, device, allowing, a, user, to, control, the, parabolic, arc, of, a, dot, on, the, screen, to, simulate, a, missile, being, fired, at, targets, which, are, paper, drawings, fixed, to, the, screen, other, early, examples, include, christopher, strachey, s, draughts, game, the, nimrod, computer, at, the, 1951, festival, of, britain, oxo, a, tic, tac, toe, computer, game, by, alexander, s, douglas, for, the, edsac, in, 1952, tennis, for, two, an, electronic, interactive, game, engineered, by, william, higinbotham, in, 1958, and, spacewar, written, by, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, students, martin, graetz, steve, russell, and, wayne, wiitanen, s, on, a, dec, pdp, 1, computer, in, 1962, each, game, has, different, means, of, display, nimrod, has, a, panel, of, lights, to, play, the, game, of, nim, oxo, has, a, graphical, display, to, play, tic, tac, toe, tennis, for, two, has, an, oscilloscope, to, display, a, side, view, of, a, tennis, court, and, spacewar, has, the, dec, pdp, 1, s, vector, display, to, have, two, spaceships, battle, each, other, these, preliminary, inventions, paved, the, way, for, the, origins, of, video, games, today, ralph, h, baer, while, working, at, sanders, associates, in, 1966, devised, a, control, system, to, play, a, rudimentary, game, of, table, tennis, on, a, television, screen, with, the, company, s, approval, baer, built, the, prototype, brown, box, sanders, patented, baer, s, inventions, and, licensed, them, to, magnavox, which, commercialized, it, as, the, first, home, video, game, console, the, magnavox, odyssey, released, in, 1972, separately, nolan, bushnell, and, ted, dabney, inspired, by, seeing, spacewar, running, at, stanford, university, devised, a, similar, version, running, in, a, smaller, coin, operated, arcade, cabinet, using, a, less, expensive, computer, this, was, released, as, computer, space, the, first, arcade, video, game, in, 1971, bushnell, and, dabney, went, on, to, form, atari, inc, and, with, allan, alcorn, created, their, second, arcade, game, in, 1972, the, hit, ping, pong, style, pong, which, was, directly, inspired, by, the, table, tennis, game, on, the, odyssey, sanders, and, magnavox, sued, atari, for, infringement, of, baer, s, patents, but, atari, settled, out, of, court, paying, for, perpetual, rights, to, the, patents, following, their, agreement, atari, made, a, home, version, of, pong, which, was, released, by, christmas, 1975, the, success, of, the, odyssey, and, pong, both, as, an, arcade, game, and, home, machine, launched, the, video, game, industry, both, baer, and, bushnell, have, been, titled, father, of, video, games, for, their, contributions, the, term, video, game, was, developed, to, distinguish, this, class, of, electronic, games, that, were, played, on, some, type, of, video, display, rather, than, on, a, teletype, printer, audio, speaker, or, similar, device, this, also, distinguished, from, many, handheld, electronic, games, like, merlin, which, commonly, used, led, lights, for, indicators, but, did, not, use, these, in, combination, for, imaging, purposes, computer, game, may, also, be, used, as, a, descriptor, as, all, these, types, of, games, essentially, require, the, use, of, a, computer, processor, and, in, some, cases, it, is, used, interchangeably, with, video, game, particularly, in, the, united, kingdom, and, western, europe, this, is, common, due, to, the, historic, relevance, of, domestically, produced, microcomputers, other, terms, used, include, digital, game, for, example, by, the, australian, bureau, of, statistics, however, the, term, computer, game, can, also, be, used, to, more, specifically, refer, to, games, played, primarily, on, personal, computers, or, other, types, of, flexible, hardware, systems, also, known, as, pc, game, as, a, way, to, distinguish, them, from, console, games, arcade, games, or, mobile, games, other, terms, such, as, television, game, or, telegame, had, been, used, in, the, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, particularly, for, the, home, gaming, consoles, that, rely, on, connection, to, a, television, set, in, japan, where, consoles, like, the, odyssey, were, first, imported, and, then, made, within, the, country, by, the, large, television, manufacturers, such, as, toshiba, and, sharp, corporation, such, games, are, known, as, tv, games, or, tv, geemu, or, terebi, geemu, electronic, game, may, also, be, used, to, refer, to, video, games, but, this, also, incorporates, devices, like, early, handheld, electronic, games, that, lack, any, video, output, and, the, term, tv, game, is, still, commonly, used, into, the, 21st, century, the, first, appearance, of, the, term, video, game, emerged, around, 1973, the, oxford, english, dictionary, cited, a, 10, november, 1973, businessweek, article, as, the, first, printed, use, of, the, term, though, bushnell, believed, the, term, came, from, a, vending, magazine, review, of, computer, space, in, 1971, a, review, of, the, major, vending, magazines, vending, times, and, cashbox, showed, that, the, term, may, have, come, even, earlier, appearing, first, in, a, letter, dated, july, 10th, 1972, in, the, letter, bushnell, uses, the, term, video, game, twice, per, video, game, historian, keith, smith, the, sudden, appearance, suggested, that, the, term, had, been, proposed, and, readily, adopted, by, those, in, the, field, around, march, 1973, ed, adlum, who, ran, cashbox, s, coin, operated, section, until, 1972, and, then, later, founded, replay, magazine, covering, the, coin, op, amusement, field, in, 1975, used, the, term, in, an, article, in, march, of, 1973, in, a, september, 1982, issue, of, replay, adlum, is, credited, with, first, naming, these, games, as, video, games, replay, s, eddie, adlum, worked, at, cash, box, when, tv, games, first, came, out, the, personalities, in, those, days, were, bushnell, his, sales, manager, pat, karns, and, a, handful, of, other, tv, game, manufacturers, like, henry, leyser, and, the, mcewan, brothers, it, seemed, awkward, to, call, their, products, tv, games, so, borrowing, a, word, from, billboard, s, description, of, movie, jukeboxes, adlum, started, to, refer, to, this, new, breed, of, amusement, machine, as, video, games, the, phrase, stuck, adlum, explained, in, 1985, that, up, until, the, early, 1970s, amusement, arcades, typically, had, non, video, arcade, games, such, as, pinball, machines, and, electro, mechanical, games, with, the, arrival, of, video, games, in, arcades, during, the, early, 1970s, there, was, initially, some, confusion, in, the, arcade, industry, over, what, term, should, be, used, to, describe, the, new, games, he, wrestled, with, descriptions, of, this, type, of, game, alternating, between, tv, game, and, television, game, but, finally, woke, up, one, day, and, said, what, the, hell, video, game, for, many, years, the, traveling, videotopia, exhibit, served, as, the, closest, representation, of, such, a, vital, resource, in, addition, to, collecting, home, video, game, consoles, the, electronics, conservancy, organization, set, out, to, locate, and, restore, 400, antique, arcade, cabinets, after, realizing, that, the, majority, of, these, games, had, been, destroyed, and, feared, the, loss, of, their, historical, significance, video, games, have, significantly, begun, to, be, seen, in, the, real, world, as, a, purpose, to, present, history, in, a, way, of, understanding, the, methodology, and, terms, that, are, being, compared, researchers, have, looked, at, how, historical, representations, affect, how, the, public, perceives, the, past, and, digital, humanists, encourage, historians, to, use, video, games, as, primary, materials, video, games, considering, their, past, and, age, have, over, time, progressed, as, what, a, video, game, really, means, whether, played, through, a, monitor, tv, or, a, hand, held, device, there, are, many, ways, that, video, games, are, being, displayed, for, users, to, enjoy, people, have, drawn, comparisons, between, flow, state, engaged, video, gamers, and, pupils, in, conventional, school, settings, in, traditional, teacher, led, classrooms, students, have, little, say, in, what, they, learn, are, passive, consumers, of, the, information, selected, by, teachers, are, required, to, follow, the, pace, and, skill, level, of, the, group, group, teaching, and, receive, brief, imprecise, normative, feedback, on, their, work, video, games, as, they, continue, to, develop, into, better, graphic, definitions, and, genres, create, new, terminology, when, something, unknown, tends, to, become, known, yearly, consoles, are, being, created, to, compete, against, other, brands, with, similar, functioning, features, that, tend, to, lead, the, consumer, into, which, they, d, like, to, purchase, now, companies, have, moved, towards, games, only, the, specific, console, can, play, to, grasp, the, consumer, into, purchasing, their, product, compared, to, when, video, games, first, began, there, was, little, to, no, variety, in, 1989, a, console, war, began, with, nintendo, one, of, the, biggest, in, gaming, up, against, target, sega, with, their, brand, new, master, system, which, failed, to, compete, allowing, the, nintendo, emulator, system, to, be, one, of, the, most, consumed, products, in, the, world, more, technology, continued, to, be, created, as, the, computer, began, to, be, used, in, people, s, houses, for, more, than, just, office, and, daily, use, games, began, being, implemented, into, computers, and, have, progressively, grown, since, then, with, coded, robots, to, play, against, you, early, games, like, tic, tac, toe, solitaire, and, tennis, for, two, were, great, ways, to, bring, new, gaming, to, another, system, rather, than, one, specifically, meant, for, gaming, while, many, games, readily, fall, into, a, clear, well, understood, definition, of, video, games, new, genres, and, innovations, in, game, development, have, raised, the, question, of, what, are, the, essential, factors, of, a, video, game, that, separate, the, medium, from, other, forms, of, entertainment, the, introduction, of, interactive, films, in, the, 1980s, with, games, like, dragon, s, lair, featured, games, with, full, motion, video, played, off, a, form, of, media, but, only, limited, user, interaction, this, had, required, a, means, to, distinguish, these, games, from, more, traditional, board, games, that, happen, to, also, use, external, media, such, as, the, clue, vcr, mystery, game, which, required, players, to, watch, vcr, clips, between, turns, to, distinguish, between, these, two, video, games, are, considered, to, require, some, interactivity, that, affects, the, visual, display, most, video, games, tend, to, feature, some, type, of, victory, or, winning, conditions, such, as, a, scoring, mechanism, or, a, final, boss, fight, the, introduction, of, walking, simulators, adventure, games, that, allow, for, exploration, but, lack, any, objectives, like, gone, home, and, empathy, games, video, games, that, tend, to, focus, on, emotion, like, that, dragon, cancer, brought, the, idea, of, games, that, did, not, have, any, such, type, of, winning, condition, and, raising, the, question, of, whether, these, were, actually, games, these, are, still, commonly, justified, as, video, games, as, they, provide, a, game, world, that, the, player, can, interact, with, by, some, means, the, lack, of, any, industry, definition, for, a, video, game, by, 2021, was, an, issue, during, the, case, epic, games, v, apple, which, dealt, with, video, games, offered, on, apple, s, ios, app, store, among, concerns, raised, were, games, like, fortnite, creative, and, roblox, which, created, metaverses, of, interactive, experiences, and, whether, the, larger, game, and, the, individual, experiences, themselves, were, games, or, not, in, relation, to, fees, that, apple, charged, for, the, app, store, judge, yvonne, gonzalez, rogers, recognizing, that, there, was, yet, an, industry, standard, definition, for, a, video, game, established, for, her, ruling, that, at, a, bare, minimum, video, games, appear, to, require, some, level, of, interactivity, or, involvement, between, the, player, and, the, medium, compared, to, passive, entertainment, like, film, music, and, television, and, videogames, are, also, generally, graphically, rendered, or, animated, as, opposed, to, being, recorded, live, or, via, motion, capture, as, in, films, or, television, rogers, still, concluded, that, what, is, a, video, game, appears, highly, eclectic, and, diverse, the, gameplay, experience, varies, radically, between, video, games, but, many, common, elements, exist, most, games, will, launch, into, a, title, screen, and, give, the, player, a, chance, to, review, options, such, as, the, number, of, players, before, starting, a, game, most, games, are, divided, into, levels, which, the, player, must, work, the, avatar, through, scoring, points, collecting, power, ups, to, boost, the, avatar, s, innate, attributes, all, while, either, using, special, attacks, to, defeat, enemies, or, moves, to, avoid, them, this, information, is, relayed, to, the, player, through, a, type, of, on, screen, user, interface, such, as, a, heads, up, display, atop, the, rendering, of, the, game, itself, taking, damage, will, deplete, their, avatar, s, health, and, if, that, falls, to, zero, or, if, the, avatar, otherwise, falls, into, an, impossible, to, escape, location, the, player, will, lose, one, of, their, lives, should, they, lose, all, their, lives, without, gaining, an, extra, life, or, 1, up, then, the, player, will, reach, the, game, over, screen, many, levels, as, well, as, the, game, s, finale, end, with, a, type, of, boss, character, the, player, must, defeat, to, continue, on, in, some, games, intermediate, points, between, levels, will, offer, save, points, where, the, player, can, create, a, saved, game, on, storage, media, to, restart, the, game, should, they, lose, all, their, lives, or, need, to, stop, the, game, and, restart, at, a, later, time, these, also, may, be, in, the, form, of, a, passage, that, can, be, written, down, and, reentered, at, the, title, screen, product, flaws, include, software, bugs, which, can, manifest, as, glitches, which, may, be, exploited, by, the, player, this, is, often, the, foundation, of, speedrunning, a, video, game, these, bugs, along, with, cheat, codes, easter, eggs, and, other, hidden, secrets, that, were, intentionally, added, to, the, game, can, also, be, exploited, on, some, consoles, cheat, cartridges, allow, players, to, execute, these, cheat, codes, and, user, developed, trainers, allow, similar, bypassing, for, computer, software, games, both, of, which, might, make, the, game, easier, give, the, player, additional, power, ups, or, change, the, appearance, of, the, game, to, distinguish, from, electronic, games, a, video, game, is, generally, considered, to, require, a, platform, the, hardware, which, contains, computing, elements, to, process, player, interaction, from, some, type, of, input, device, and, displays, the, results, to, a, video, output, display, video, games, require, a, platform, a, specific, combination, of, electronic, components, or, computer, hardware, and, associated, software, to, operate, the, term, system, is, also, commonly, used, these, platforms, may, include, multiple, brandsheld, by, platform, holders, such, as, nintendo, or, sony, seeking, to, gain, larger, market, shares, games, are, typically, designed, to, be, played, on, one, or, a, limited, number, of, platforms, and, exclusivity, to, a, platform, or, brand, is, used, by, platform, holders, as, a, competitive, edge, in, the, video, game, market, however, games, may, be, developed, for, alternative, platforms, than, intended, which, are, described, as, ports, or, conversions, these, also, may, be, remasters, where, most, of, the, original, game, s, source, code, is, reused, and, art, assets, models, and, game, levels, are, updated, for, modern, systems, and, remakes, where, in, addition, to, asset, improvements, significant, reworking, of, the, original, game, and, possibly, from, scratch, is, performed, the, list, below, is, not, exhaustive, and, excludes, other, electronic, devices, capable, of, playing, video, games, such, as, pdas, and, graphing, calculators, early, arcade, games, home, consoles, and, handheld, games, were, dedicated, hardware, units, with, the, game, s, logic, built, into, the, electronic, componentry, of, the, hardware, since, then, most, video, game, platforms, are, considered, programmable, having, means, to, read, and, play, multiple, games, distributed, on, different, types, of, media, or, formats, physical, formats, include, rom, cartridges, magnetic, storage, including, magnetic, tape, data, storage, and, floppy, discs, optical, media, formats, including, cd, rom, and, dvds, and, flash, memory, cards, furthermore, digital, distribution, over, the, internet, or, other, communication, methods, as, well, as, cloud, gaming, alleviate, the, need, for, any, physical, media, in, some, cases, the, media, serves, as, the, direct, read, only, memory, for, the, game, or, it, may, be, the, form, of, installation, media, that, is, used, to, write, the, main, assets, to, the, player, s, platform, s, local, storage, for, faster, loading, periods, and, later, updates, games, can, be, extended, with, new, content, and, software, patches, through, either, expansion, packs, which, are, typically, available, as, physical, media, or, as, downloadable, content, nominally, available, via, digital, distribution, these, can, be, offered, freely, or, can, be, used, to, monetize, a, game, following, its, initial, release, several, games, offer, players, the, ability, to, create, user, generated, content, to, share, with, others, to, play, other, games, mostly, those, on, personal, computers, can, be, extended, with, user, created, modifications, or, mods, that, alter, or, add, onto, the, game, these, often, are, unofficial, and, were, developed, by, players, from, reverse, engineering, of, the, game, but, other, games, provide, official, support, for, modding, the, game, video, game, can, use, several, types, of, input, devices, to, translate, human, actions, to, a, game, most, common, are, the, use, of, game, controllers, like, gamepads, and, joysticks, for, most, consoles, and, as, accessories, for, personal, computer, systems, along, keyboard, and, mouse, controls, common, controls, on, the, most, recent, controllers, include, face, buttons, shoulder, triggers, analog, sticks, and, directional, pads, d, pads, consoles, typically, include, standard, controllers, which, are, shipped, or, bundled, with, the, console, itself, while, peripheral, controllers, are, available, as, a, separate, purchase, from, the, console, manufacturer, or, third, party, vendors, similar, control, sets, are, built, into, handheld, consoles, and, onto, arcade, cabinets, newer, technology, improvements, have, incorporated, additional, technology, into, the, controller, or, the, game, platform, such, as, touchscreens, and, motion, detection, sensors, that, give, more, options, for, how, the, player, interacts, with, the, game, specialized, controllers, may, be, used, for, certain, genres, of, games, including, racing, wheels, light, guns, and, dance, pads, digital, cameras, and, motion, detection, can, capture, movements, of, the, player, as, input, into, the, game, which, can, in, some, cases, effectively, eliminate, the, control, and, on, other, systems, such, as, virtual, reality, are, used, to, enhance, immersion, into, the, game, by, definition, all, video, games, are, intended, to, output, graphics, to, an, external, video, display, such, as, cathode, ray, tube, televisions, newer, liquid, crystal, display, lcd, televisions, and, built, in, screens, projectors, or, computer, monitors, depending, on, the, type, of, platform, the, game, is, played, on, features, such, as, color, depth, refresh, rate, frame, rate, and, screen, resolution, are, a, combination, of, the, limitations, of, the, game, platform, and, display, device, and, the, program, efficiency, of, the, game, itself, the, game, s, output, can, range, from, fixed, displays, using, led, or, lcd, elements, text, based, games, two, dimensional, and, three, dimensional, graphics, and, augmented, reality, displays, the, game, s, graphics, are, often, accompanied, by, sound, produced, by, internal, speakers, on, the, game, platform, or, external, speakers, attached, to, the, platform, as, directed, by, the, game, s, programming, this, often, will, include, sound, effects, tied, to, the, player, s, actions, to, provide, audio, feedback, as, well, as, background, music, for, the, game, some, platforms, support, additional, feedback, mechanics, to, the, player, that, a, game, can, take, advantage, of, this, is, most, commonly, haptic, technology, built, into, the, game, controller, such, as, causing, the, controller, to, shake, in, the, player, s, hands, to, simulate, a, shaking, earthquake, occurring, in, game, video, games, are, frequently, classified, by, a, number, of, factors, related, to, how, one, plays, them, a, video, game, like, most, other, forms, of, media, may, be, categorized, into, genres, however, unlike, film, or, television, which, use, visual, or, narrative, elements, video, games, are, generally, categorized, into, genres, based, on, their, gameplay, interaction, since, this, is, the, primary, means, which, one, interacts, with, a, video, game, the, narrative, setting, does, not, impact, gameplay, a, shooter, game, is, still, a, shooter, game, regardless, of, whether, it, takes, place, in, a, fantasy, world, or, in, outer, space, an, exception, is, the, horror, game, genre, used, for, games, that, are, based, on, narrative, elements, of, horror, fiction, the, supernatural, and, psychological, horror, genre, names, are, normally, self, describing, in, terms, of, the, type, of, gameplay, such, as, action, game, role, playing, game, or, shoot, em, up, though, some, genres, have, derivations, from, influential, works, that, have, defined, that, genre, such, as, roguelikes, from, rogue, grand, theft, auto, clones, from, grand, theft, auto, iii, and, battle, royale, games, from, the, film, battle, royale, the, names, may, shift, over, time, as, players, developers, and, the, media, come, up, with, new, terms, for, example, first, person, shooters, were, originally, called, doom, clones, based, on, the, 1993, game, a, hierarchy, of, game, genres, exist, with, top, level, genres, like, shooter, game, and, action, game, that, broadly, capture, the, game, s, main, gameplay, style, and, several, subgenres, of, specific, implementation, such, as, within, the, shooter, game, first, person, shooter, and, third, person, shooter, some, cross, genre, types, also, exist, that, fall, until, multiple, top, level, genres, such, as, action, adventure, game, a, video, game, s, mode, describes, how, many, players, can, use, the, game, at, the, same, type, this, is, primarily, distinguished, by, single, player, video, games, and, multiplayer, video, games, within, the, latter, category, multiplayer, games, can, be, played, in, a, variety, of, ways, including, locally, at, the, same, device, on, separate, devices, connected, through, a, local, network, such, as, lan, parties, or, online, via, separate, internet, connections, most, multiplayer, games, are, based, on, competitive, gameplay, but, many, offer, cooperative, and, team, based, options, as, well, as, asymmetric, gameplay, online, games, use, server, structures, that, can, also, enable, massively, multiplayer, online, games, mmos, to, support, hundreds, of, players, at, the, same, time, a, small, number, of, video, games, are, zero, player, games, in, which, the, player, has, very, limited, interaction, with, the, game, itself, these, are, most, commonly, simulation, games, where, the, player, may, establish, a, starting, state, and, then, let, the, game, proceed, on, its, own, watching, the, results, as, a, passive, observer, such, as, with, many, computerized, simulations, of, conway, s, game, of, life, most, video, games, are, intended, for, entertainment, purposes, different, game, types, include, video, games, can, be, subject, to, national, and, international, content, rating, requirements, like, with, film, content, ratings, video, game, ratings, typing, identify, the, target, age, group, that, the, national, or, regional, ratings, board, believes, is, appropriate, for, the, player, ranging, from, all, ages, to, a, teenager, or, older, to, mature, to, the, infrequent, adult, only, games, most, content, review, is, based, on, the, level, of, violence, both, in, the, type, of, violence, and, how, graphic, it, may, be, represented, and, sexual, content, but, other, themes, such, as, drug, and, alcohol, use, and, gambling, that, can, influence, children, may, also, be, identified, a, primary, identifier, based, on, a, minimum, age, is, used, by, nearly, all, systems, along, with, additional, descriptors, to, identify, specific, content, that, players, and, parents, should, be, aware, of, the, regulations, vary, from, country, to, country, but, generally, are, voluntary, systems, upheld, by, vendor, practices, with, penalty, and, fines, issued, by, the, ratings, body, on, the, video, game, publisher, for, misuse, of, the, ratings, among, the, major, content, rating, systems, include, additionally, the, major, content, system, provides, have, worked, to, create, the, international, age, rating, coalition, iarc, a, means, to, streamline, and, align, the, content, ratings, system, between, different, region, so, that, a, publisher, would, only, need, to, complete, the, content, ratings, review, for, one, provider, and, use, the, iarc, transition, to, affirm, the, content, rating, for, all, other, regions, certain, nations, have, even, more, restrictive, rules, related, to, political, or, ideological, content, within, germany, until, 2018, the, unterhaltungssoftware, selbstkontrolle, entertainment, software, self, regulation, would, refuse, to, classify, and, thus, allow, sale, of, any, game, depicting, nazi, imagery, and, thus, often, requiring, developers, to, replace, such, imagery, with, fictional, ones, this, ruling, was, relaxed, in, 2018, to, allow, for, such, imagery, for, social, adequacy, purposes, that, applied, to, other, works, of, art, china, s, video, game, segment, is, mostly, isolated, from, the, rest, of, the, world, due, to, the, government, s, censorship, and, all, games, published, there, must, adhere, to, strict, government, review, disallowing, content, such, as, smearing, the, image, of, the, chinese, communist, party, foreign, games, published, in, china, often, require, modification, by, developers, and, publishers, to, meet, these, requirements, video, game, development, and, authorship, much, like, any, other, form, of, entertainment, is, frequently, a, cross, disciplinary, field, video, game, developers, as, employees, within, this, industry, are, commonly, referred, to, primarily, include, programmers, and, graphic, designers, over, the, years, this, has, expanded, to, include, almost, every, type, of, skill, that, one, might, see, prevalent, in, the, creation, of, any, movie, or, television, program, including, sound, designers, musicians, and, other, technicians, as, well, as, skills, that, are, specific, to, video, games, such, as, the, game, designer, all, of, these, are, managed, by, producers, in, the, early, days, of, the, industry, it, was, more, common, for, a, single, person, to, manage, all, of, the, roles, needed, to, create, a, video, game, as, platforms, have, become, more, complex, and, powerful, in, the, type, of, material, they, can, present, larger, teams, have, been, needed, to, generate, all, of, the, art, programming, cinematography, and, more, this, is, not, to, say, that, the, age, of, the, one, man, shop, is, gone, as, this, is, still, sometimes, found, in, the, casual, gaming, and, handheld, markets, where, smaller, games, are, prevalent, due, to, technical, limitations, such, as, limited, ram, or, lack, of, dedicated, 3d, graphics, rendering, capabilities, on, the, target, platform, e, g, some, pdas, video, games, are, programmed, like, any, other, piece, of, computer, software, prior, to, the, mid, 1970s, arcade, and, home, consoles, were, programmed, by, assembling, discrete, electro, mechanical, components, on, circuit, boards, which, limited, games, to, relatively, simple, logic, by, 1975, low, cost, microprocessors, were, available, at, volume, to, be, used, for, video, game, hardware, which, allowed, game, developers, to, program, more, detailed, games, widening, the, scope, of, what, was, possible, ongoing, improvements, in, computer, hardware, technology, have, expanded, what, has, become, possible, to, create, in, video, games, coupled, with, convergence, of, common, hardware, between, console, computer, and, arcade, platforms, to, simplify, the, development, process, today, game, developers, have, a, number, of, commercial, and, open, source, tools, available, for, use, to, make, games, often, which, are, across, multiple, platforms, to, support, portability, or, may, still, opt, to, create, their, own, for, more, specialized, features, and, direct, control, of, the, game, today, many, games, are, built, around, a, game, engine, that, handles, the, bulk, of, the, game, s, logic, gameplay, and, rendering, these, engines, can, be, augmented, with, specialized, engines, for, specific, features, such, as, a, physics, engine, that, simulates, the, physics, of, objects, in, real, time, a, variety, of, middleware, exists, to, help, developers, access, other, features, such, as, playback, of, videos, within, games, network, oriented, code, for, games, that, communicate, via, online, services, matchmaking, for, online, games, and, similar, features, these, features, can, be, used, from, a, developer, s, programming, language, of, choice, or, they, may, opt, to, also, use, game, development, kits, that, minimize, the, amount, of, direct, programming, they, have, to, do, but, can, also, limit, the, amount, of, customization, they, can, add, into, a, game, like, all, software, video, games, usually, undergo, quality, testing, before, release, to, assure, there, are, no, bugs, or, glitches, in, the, product, though, frequently, developers, will, release, patches, and, updates, with, the, growth, of, the, size, of, development, teams, in, the, industry, the, problem, of, cost, has, increased, development, studios, need, the, best, talent, while, publishers, reduce, costs, to, maintain, profitability, on, their, investment, typically, a, video, game, console, development, team, ranges, from, 5, to, 50, people, and, some, exceed, 100, in, may, 2009, assassin, s, creed, ii, was, reported, to, have, a, development, staff, of, 450, the, growth, of, team, size, combined, with, greater, pressure, to, get, completed, projects, into, the, market, to, begin, recouping, production, costs, has, led, to, a, greater, occurrence, of, missed, deadlines, rushed, games, and, the, release, of, unfinished, products, while, amateur, and, hobbyist, game, programming, had, existed, since, the, late, 1970s, with, the, introduction, of, home, computers, a, newer, trend, since, the, mid, 2000s, is, indie, game, development, indie, games, are, made, by, small, teams, outside, any, direct, publisher, control, their, games, being, smaller, in, scope, than, those, from, the, larger, aaa, game, studios, and, are, often, experiments, in, gameplay, and, art, style, indie, game, development, is, aided, by, the, larger, availability, of, digital, distribution, including, the, newer, mobile, gaming, market, and, readily, available, and, low, cost, development, tools, for, these, platforms, although, departments, of, computer, science, have, been, studying, the, technical, aspects, of, video, games, for, years, theories, that, examine, games, as, an, artistic, medium, are, a, relatively, recent, development, in, the, humanities, the, two, most, visible, schools, in, this, emerging, field, are, ludology, and, narratology, narrativists, approach, video, games, in, the, context, of, what, janet, murray, calls, cyberdrama, that, is, to, say, their, major, concern, is, with, video, games, as, a, storytelling, medium, one, that, arises, out, of, interactive, fiction, murray, puts, video, games, in, the, context, of, the, holodeck, a, fictional, piece, of, technology, from, star, trek, arguing, for, the, video, game, as, a, medium, in, which, the, player, is, allowed, to, become, another, person, and, to, act, out, in, another, world, this, image, of, video, games, received, early, widespread, popular, support, and, forms, the, basis, of, films, such, as, tron, existenz, and, the, last, starfighter, ludologists, break, sharply, and, radically, from, this, idea, they, argue, that, a, video, game, is, first, and, foremost, a, game, which, must, be, understood, in, terms, of, its, rules, interface, and, the, concept, of, play, that, it, deploys, espen, j, aarseth, argues, that, although, games, certainly, have, plots, characters, and, aspects, of, traditional, narratives, these, aspects, are, incidental, to, gameplay, for, example, aarseth, is, critical, of, the, widespread, attention, that, narrativists, have, given, to, the, heroine, of, the, game, tomb, raider, saying, that, the, dimensions, of, lara, croft, s, body, already, analyzed, to, death, by, film, theorists, are, irrelevant, to, me, as, a, player, because, a, different, looking, body, would, not, make, me, play, differently, when, i, play, i, don, t, even, see, her, body, but, see, through, it, and, past, it, simply, put, ludologists, reject, traditional, theories, of, art, because, they, claim, that, the, artistic, and, socially, relevant, qualities, of, a, video, game, are, primarily, determined, by, the, underlying, set, of, rules, demands, and, expectations, imposed, on, the, player, while, many, games, rely, on, emergent, principles, video, games, commonly, present, simulated, story, worlds, where, emergent, behavior, occurs, within, the, context, of, the, game, the, term, emergent, narrative, has, been, used, to, describe, how, in, a, simulated, environment, storyline, can, be, created, simply, by, what, happens, to, the, player, however, emergent, behavior, is, not, limited, to, sophisticated, games, in, general, any, place, where, event, driven, instructions, occur, for, ai, in, a, game, emergent, behavior, will, exist, for, instance, take, a, racing, game, in, which, cars, are, programmed, to, avoid, crashing, and, they, encounter, an, obstacle, in, the, track, the, cars, might, then, maneuver, to, avoid, the, obstacle, causing, the, cars, behind, them, to, slow, or, maneuver, to, accommodate, the, cars, in, front, of, them, and, the, obstacle, the, programmer, never, wrote, code, to, specifically, create, a, traffic, jam, yet, one, now, exists, in, the, game, most, commonly, video, games, are, protected, by, copyright, though, both, patents, and, trademarks, have, been, used, as, well, though, local, copyright, regulations, vary, to, the, degree, of, protection, video, games, qualify, as, copyrighted, visual, audio, works, and, enjoy, cross, country, protection, under, the, berne, convention, this, typically, only, applies, to, the, underlying, code, as, well, as, to, the, artistic, aspects, of, the, game, such, as, its, writing, art, assets, and, music, gameplay, itself, is, generally, not, considered, copyrightable, in, the, united, states, among, other, countries, video, games, are, considered, to, fall, into, the, idea, expression, distinction, in, that, it, is, how, the, game, is, presented, and, expressed, to, the, player, that, can, be, copyrighted, but, not, the, underlying, principles, of, the, game, because, gameplay, is, normally, ineligible, for, copyright, gameplay, ideas, in, popular, games, are, often, replicated, and, built, upon, in, other, games, at, times, this, repurposing, of, gameplay, can, be, seen, as, beneficial, and, a, fundamental, part, of, how, the, industry, has, grown, by, building, on, the, ideas, of, others, for, example, doom, 1993, and, grand, theft, auto, iii, 2001, introduced, gameplay, that, created, popular, new, game, genres, the, first, person, shooter, and, the, grand, theft, auto, clone, respectively, in, the, few, years, after, their, release, however, at, times, and, more, frequently, at, the, onset, of, the, industry, developers, would, intentionally, create, video, game, clones, of, successful, games, and, game, hardware, with, few, changes, which, led, to, the, flooded, arcade, and, dedicated, home, console, market, around, 1978, cloning, is, also, a, major, issue, with, countries, that, do, not, have, strong, intellectual, property, protection, laws, such, as, within, china, the, lax, oversight, by, china, s, government, and, the, difficulty, for, foreign, companies, to, take, chinese, entities, to, court, had, enabled, china, to, support, a, large, grey, market, of, cloned, hardware, and, software, systems, the, industry, remains, challenged, to, distinguish, between, creating, new, games, based, on, refinements, of, past, successful, games, to, create, a, new, type, of, gameplay, and, intentionally, creating, a, clone, of, a, game, that, may, simply, swap, out, art, assets, the, early, history, of, the, video, game, industry, following, the, first, game, hardware, releases, and, through, 1983, had, little, structure, video, games, quickly, took, off, during, the, golden, age, of, arcade, video, games, from, the, late, 1970s, to, early, 1980s, but, the, newfound, industry, was, mainly, composed, of, game, developers, with, little, business, experience, this, led, to, numerous, companies, forming, simply, to, create, clones, of, popular, games, to, try, to, capitalize, on, the, market, due, to, loss, of, publishing, control, and, oversaturation, of, the, market, the, north, american, home, video, game, market, crashed, in, 1983, dropping, from, revenues, of, around, 3, billion, in, 1983, to, 100, million, by, 1985, many, of, the, north, american, companies, created, in, the, prior, years, closed, down, japan, s, growing, game, industry, was, briefly, shocked, by, this, crash, but, had, sufficient, longevity, to, withstand, the, short, term, effects, and, nintendo, helped, to, revitalize, the, industry, with, the, release, of, the, nintendo, entertainment, system, in, north, america, in, 1985, along, with, it, nintendo, established, a, number, of, core, industrial, practices, to, prevent, unlicensed, game, development, and, control, game, distribution, on, their, platform, methods, that, continue, to, be, used, by, console, manufacturers, today, the, industry, remained, more, conservative, following, the, 1983, crash, forming, around, the, concept, of, publisher, developer, dichotomies, and, by, the, 2000s, leading, to, the, industry, centralizing, around, low, risk, triple, a, games, and, studios, with, large, development, budgets, of, at, least, 10, million, or, more, the, advent, of, the, internet, brought, digital, distribution, as, a, viable, means, to, distribute, games, and, contributed, to, the, growth, of, more, riskier, experimental, independent, game, development, as, an, alternative, to, triple, a, games, in, the, late, 2000s, and, which, has, continued, to, grow, as, a, significant, portion, of, the, video, game, industry, video, games, have, a, large, network, effect, that, draw, on, many, different, sectors, that, tie, into, the, larger, video, game, industry, while, video, game, developers, are, a, significant, portion, of, the, industry, other, key, participants, in, the, market, include, the, industry, itself, grew, out, from, both, the, united, states, and, japan, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, before, having, a, larger, worldwide, contribution, today, the, video, game, industry, is, predominantly, led, by, major, companies, in, north, america, primarily, the, united, states, and, canada, europe, and, southeast, asia, including, japan, south, korea, and, china, hardware, production, remains, an, area, dominated, by, asian, companies, either, directly, involved, in, hardware, design, or, part, of, the, production, process, but, digital, distribution, and, indie, game, development, of, the, late, 2000s, has, allowed, game, developers, to, flourish, nearly, anywhere, and, diversify, the, field, according, to, the, market, research, firm, newzoo, the, global, video, game, industry, drew, estimated, revenues, of, over, 159, billion, in, 2020, mobile, games, accounted, for, the, bulk, of, this, with, a, 48, share, of, the, market, followed, by, console, games, at, 28, and, personal, computer, games, at, 23, sales, of, different, types, of, games, vary, widely, between, countries, due, to, local, preferences, japanese, consumers, tend, to, purchase, much, more, handheld, games, than, console, games, and, especially, pc, games, with, a, strong, preference, for, games, catering, to, local, tastes, another, key, difference, is, that, though, having, declined, in, the, west, arcade, games, remain, an, important, sector, of, the, japanese, gaming, industry, in, south, korea, computer, games, are, generally, preferred, over, console, games, especially, mmorpg, games, and, real, time, strategy, games, computer, games, are, also, popular, in, china, video, game, culture, is, a, worldwide, new, media, subculture, formed, around, video, games, and, game, playing, as, computer, and, video, games, have, increased, in, popularity, over, time, they, have, had, a, significant, influence, on, popular, culture, video, game, culture, has, also, evolved, over, time, hand, in, hand, with, internet, culture, as, well, as, the, increasing, popularity, of, mobile, games, many, people, who, play, video, games, identify, as, gamers, which, can, mean, anything, from, someone, who, enjoys, games, to, someone, who, is, passionate, about, it, as, video, games, become, more, social, with, multiplayer, and, online, capability, gamers, find, themselves, in, growing, social, networks, gaming, can, both, be, entertainment, as, well, as, competition, as, a, new, trend, known, as, electronic, sports, is, becoming, more, widely, accepted, in, the, 2010s, video, games, and, discussions, of, video, game, trends, and, topics, can, be, seen, in, social, media, politics, television, film, and, music, the, covid, 19, pandemic, during, 2020, 2021, gave, further, visibility, to, video, games, as, a, pastime, to, enjoy, with, friends, and, family, online, as, a, means, of, social, distancing, since, the, mid, 2000s, there, has, been, debate, whether, video, games, qualify, as, art, primarily, as, the, form, s, interactivity, interfered, with, the, artistic, intent, of, the, work, and, that, they, are, designed, for, commercial, appeal, a, significant, debate, on, the, matter, came, after, film, critic, roger, ebert, published, an, essay, video, games, can, never, be, art, which, challenged, the, industry, to, prove, him, and, other, critics, wrong, the, view, that, video, games, were, an, art, form, was, cemented, in, 2011, when, the, u, s, supreme, court, ruled, in, the, landmark, case, brown, v, entertainment, merchants, association, that, video, games, were, a, protected, form, of, speech, with, artistic, merit, since, then, video, game, developers, have, come, to, use, the, form, more, for, artistic, expression, including, the, development, of, art, games, and, the, cultural, heritage, of, video, games, as, works, of, arts, beyond, their, technical, capabilities, have, been, part, of, major, museum, exhibits, including, the, art, of, video, games, at, the, smithsonian, american, art, museum, and, toured, at, other, museums, from, 2012, to, 2016, video, games, will, inspire, sequels, and, other, video, games, within, the, same, franchise, but, also, have, influenced, works, outside, of, the, video, game, medium, numerous, television, shows, both, animated, and, live, action, films, comics, and, novels, have, been, created, based, on, existing, video, game, franchises, because, video, games, are, an, interactive, medium, there, has, been, trouble, in, converting, them, to, these, passive, forms, of, media, and, typically, such, works, have, been, critically, panned, or, treated, as, children, s, media, for, example, until, 2019, no, video, game, film, had, ever, been, received, a, fresh, rating, on, rotten, tomatoes, but, the, releases, of, detective, pikachu, 2019, and, sonic, the, hedgehog, 2020, both, receiving, fresh, ratings, shows, signs, of, the, film, industry, having, found, an, approach, to, adapt, video, games, for, the, large, screen, that, said, some, early, video, game, based, films, have, been, highly, successful, at, the, box, office, such, as, 1995, s, mortal, kombat, and, 2001, s, lara, croft, tomb, raider, more, recently, since, the, 2000s, there, has, also, become, a, larger, appreciation, of, video, game, music, which, ranges, from, chiptunes, composed, for, limited, sound, output, devices, on, early, computers, and, consoles, to, fully, scored, compositions, for, most, modern, games, such, music, has, frequently, served, as, a, platform, for, covers, and, remixes, and, concerts, featuring, video, game, soundtracks, performed, by, bands, or, orchestras, such, as, video, games, live, have, also, become, popular, video, games, also, frequently, incorporate, licensed, music, particularly, in, the, area, of, rhythm, games, furthering, the, depth, of, which, video, games, and, music, can, work, together, further, video, games, can, serve, as, a, virtual, environment, under, full, control, of, a, producer, to, create, new, works, with, the, capability, to, render, 3d, actors, and, settings, in, real, time, a, new, type, of, work, machinima, short, for, machine, cinema, grew, out, from, using, video, game, engines, to, craft, narratives, as, video, game, engines, gain, higher, fidelity, they, have, also, become, part, of, the, tools, used, in, more, traditional, filmmaking, unreal, engine, has, been, used, as, a, backbone, by, industrial, light, magic, for, their, stagecraft, technology, for, shows, like, the, mandalorian, separately, video, games, are, also, frequently, used, as, part, of, the, promotion, and, marketing, for, other, media, such, as, for, films, anime, and, comics, however, these, licensed, games, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, often, had, a, reputation, for, poor, quality, developed, without, any, input, from, the, intellectual, property, rights, owners, and, several, of, them, are, considered, among, lists, of, games, with, notably, negative, reception, such, as, superman, 64, more, recently, with, these, licensed, games, being, developed, by, triple, a, studios, or, through, studios, directly, connected, to, the, licensed, property, owner, there, has, been, a, significant, improvement, in, the, quality, of, these, games, with, an, early, trendsetting, example, of, batman, arkham, asylum, besides, their, entertainment, value, appropriately, designed, video, games, have, been, seen, to, provide, value, in, education, across, several, ages, and, comprehension, levels, learning, principles, found, in, video, games, have, been, identified, as, possible, techniques, with, which, to, reform, the, u, s, education, system, it, has, been, noticed, that, gamers, adopt, an, attitude, while, playing, that, is, of, such, high, concentration, they, do, not, realize, they, are, learning, and, that, if, the, same, attitude, could, be, adopted, at, school, education, would, enjoy, significant, benefits, students, are, found, to, be, learning, by, doing, while, playing, video, games, while, fostering, creative, thinking, video,
