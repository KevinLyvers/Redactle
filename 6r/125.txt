mayonnaise, m, e, n, e, z, colloquially, referred, to, as, mayo, m, e, o, is, a, thick, cold, and, creamy, sauce, commonly, used, on, sandwiches, hamburgers, composed, salads, and, french, fries, it, also, forms, the, base, for, various, other, sauces, such, as, tartar, sauce, fry, sauce, remoulade, salsa, golf, ranch, dressing, and, rouille, mayonnaise, is, an, emulsion, of, oil, egg, yolk, and, an, acid, either, vinegar, or, lemon, juice, there, are, many, variants, using, additional, flavorings, the, color, varies, from, near, white, to, pale, yellow, and, its, texture, from, a, light, cream, to, a, thick, gel, commercial, eggless, versions, are, made, for, those, who, avoid, chicken, eggs, because, of, egg, allergies, to, limit, dietary, cholesterol, or, because, they, are, vegetarian, or, vegan, mayonnaise, is, a, french, cuisine, appellation, that, seems, to, have, appeared, for, the, first, time, in, 1806, the, hypotheses, invoked, over, time, as, to, the, origin, s, of, mayonnaise, have, been, numerous, and, contradictory, most, hypotheses, do, however, agree, on, the, geographical, origin, of, the, sauce, mah, n, in, menorca, spain, other, theories, have, been, dismissed, by, some, authors, as, being, somewhat, a, retrospective, invention, aiming, to, credit, the, sauce, as, an, invention, of, south, western, france, when, most, likely, its, origin, can, be, found, in, the, port, city, of, menorca, according, to, mile, littr, it, may, have, come, from, mah, n, capital, of, menorca, in, the, balearic, islands, spain, occupied, by, the, british, at, the, time, and, then, conquered, by, the, duc, de, richelieu, in, 1756, his, cook, would, have, presented, him, with, this, sauce, called, the, mahonnaise, made, with, the, only, two, ingredients, he, had, egg, and, oil, nevertheless, this, sauce, was, starting, to, be, described, a, little, before, this, event, while, several, versions, of, similar, sauces, existed, in, france, and, in, spain, mayonnaise, sauce, may, have, its, origins, in, the, ancient, remoulade, another, hypothesis, is, that, mayonnaise, is, derived, from, aioli, finally, the, process, of, emulsifying, egg, yolk, was, known, for, a, long, time, to, pharmacists, who, used, it, to, prepare, ointments, and, salves, some, have, pointed, out, that, it, would, make, sense, that, mayonnaise, originated, in, spain, given, its, requirement, of, olive, oil, a, liquid, produced, and, consumed, mostly, there, at, the, time, this, hypothesis, is, similar, to, another, that, places, the, origins, of, french, fries, in, spain, using, the, same, rationale, remoulade, sauce, was, known, for, a, long, time, and, there, were, hot, and, cold, versions, of, it, in, both, cases, the, base, was, oil, vinegar, salt, herbs, often, other, ingredients, such, as, capers, or, anchovies, and, then, mustard, in, short, it, was, an, enriched, vinaigrette, in, the, early, 18th, century, vincent, la, chapelle, had, the, idea, of, incorporating, velout, based, on, roux, a, mixture, of, flour, and, fat, to, bind, it, in, 1742, fran, ois, marin, published, in, the, suite, des, dons, de, comus, a, recipe, called, beurre, de, provence, which, contains, garlic, cloves, cooked, in, water, crushed, with, salt, pepper, capers, and, anchovies, then, mixed, with, oil, this, recipe, is, also, close, to, the, aioli, the, egg, yolk, appearing, later, in, 1750, francesc, roger, gomila, a, valencian, friar, published, a, recipe, for, a, sauce, similar, to, mayonnaise, in, art, de, la, cuina, the, art, of, cooking, he, calls, the, sauce, aioli, bo, if, he, does, not, describe, precisely, the, recipe, suggesting, that, it, was, known, by, everyone, on, the, island, the, way, it, is, used, the, preparations, for, which, it, is, used, as, a, base, and, the, dishes, with, which, it, is, associated, are, most, often, inconceivable, with, an, aioli, earlier, recipes, of, similar, emulsified, sauces, usually, containing, garlic, appear, in, a, number, of, spanish, recipe, books, dating, back, to, the, 14th, century, llibre, de, sent, sov, where, it, is, called, all, i, oli, literally, garlic, and, oil, in, catalan, this, sauce, had, clearly, spread, throughout, the, crown, of, aragon, for, juan, de, altamiras, gives, a, recipe, for, it, in, his, celebrated, 1745, recipe, book, nuevo, arte, de, cocina, new, art, of, cooking, on, april, 18, 1756, the, duke, of, richelieu, invaded, menorca, and, took, the, port, of, mahon, a, theory, states, that, the, aioli, bo, sauce, was, thereafter, adopted, by, the, cook, of, the, duke, of, richelieu, who, upon, his, return, to, france, made, the, sauce, famous, in, the, french, court, which, would, have, been, known, as, mahonnaise, a, number, of, legends, arose, relating, how, the, duke, of, richelieu, first, tried, the, sauce, including, his, discovery, of, the, sauce, in, a, local, inn, of, mahon, where, he, would, have, allegedly, asked, the, innkeeper, to, make, him, some, dinner, during, the, siege, of, mahon, and, even, that, he, invented, it, himself, as, a, quick, garnish, another, version, is, grimod, de, la, reyni, re, s, 1808, bayonnaise, sauce, which, is, a, sort, of, aspic, but, if, one, wants, to, make, from, this, cold, chicken, a, dish, of, distinction, one, composes, a, bayonnaise, whose, green, jelly, of, a, good, consistency, forms, the, most, worthy, ornament, of, poultry, and, fish, salads, in, 1806, andr, viard, in, le, cuisinier, imp, rial, transformed, this, recipe, for, remoulade, by, replacing, the, roux, with, egg, yolk, in, another, recipe, an, indian, remoulade, without, mustard, he, specifies, that, the, binding, is, facilitated, by, incorporating, the, oil, little, by, little, this, is, the, first, modern, mention, of, a, stable, cold, emulsified, sauce, in, the, same, book, he, also, proposes, a, sauce, called, mayonnaise, the, first, recorded, attestation, of, the, name, but, which, is, not, an, emulsion, but, a, sauce, linked, to, velout, and, jelly, it, is, only, in, 1815, that, antonin, car, me, mentions, a, cold, magnonaise, emulsified, with, egg, yolk, the, word, mayonnaise, is, attested, in, english, in, 1815, auguste, escoffier, wrote, that, mayonnaise, was, a, french, mother, sauce, of, cold, sauces, like, espagnole, or, velout, the, origin, of, the, name, mayonnaise, is, unclear, though, some, records, indicate, its, introduction, to, the, early, 1800s, with, numerous, suggested, sometimes, contradictory, suggestions, a, common, theory, is, that, it, is, named, for, port, mahon, ma, in, catalan, itself, named, after, its, founder, mago, barca, in, menorca, in, honor, of, the, 3rd, duke, of, richelieu, s, victory, over, the, british, in, 1756, and, in, fact, the, name, mahonnaise, is, used, by, some, authors, but, the, name, is, only, attested, several, decades, after, that, event, one, version, of, this, theory, says, that, it, was, originally, known, as, salsa, mahonesa, in, spanish, but, that, spelling, too, is, only, attested, later, alexandre, balthazar, laurent, grimod, de, la, reyni, re, a, lawyer, by, qualification, who, acquired, fame, during, the, reign, of, napoleon, for, his, sensual, and, public, gastronomic, lifestyle, rejected, the, name, mayonnaise, because, the, word, is, not, french, he, also, rejected, the, name, mahonnaise, because, port, mahon, is, not, known, for, good, food, and, thus, he, preferred, bayonnaise, after, the, city, of, bayonne, which, has, many, innovative, gourmands, and, produces, the, best, hams, in, europe, indeed, the, city, of, bayonne, sauce, la, bayonnaise, could, also, have, given, its, name, to, this, type, of, sauce, by, spelling, deformation, this, form, would, seem, to, be, confirmed, by, the, fact, that, there, is, no, written, record, of, the, sauce, la, mayonnaise, before, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, long, after, the, capture, of, the, city, of, mah, n, another, hypothesis, is, based, according, to, marie, antoine, car, me, a, famous, contemporary, french, chef, on, a, derivative, of, magnonaise, from, the, verb, magner, or, manier, or, according, to, prosper, montagn, of, moyeunaise, or, moyennaise, based, on, moyeu, x, or, moyen, which, means, egg, yolk, in, old, french, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, word, be, linked, to, the, old, verb, mailler, meaning, to, beat, joseph, favre, for, his, part, states, in, his, memoirs, that, mayonnaise, is, an, alteration, of, the, word, magnonnaise, derived, from, magnon, lot, et, garonne, and, that, a, cook, from, magnon, would, have, popularized, it, first, in, the, south, of, france, he, notes, that, this, sauce, has, been, variously, named, mahonnaise, bayonnaise, and, mayonnaise, a, more, controversial, hypothesis, put, forward, by, the, linguist, and, historian, nicolas, lepreux, suggests, that, mayonnaise, originated, in, the, mayenne, region, and, that, the, e, would, have, changed, into, an, o, over, time, the, apocryphal, story, tells, that, the, duke, of, mayenne, on, the, day, before, the, battle, of, arques, overindulged, on, chickens, seasoned, with, a, remarkable, sauce, so, that, the, next, day, he, fell, off, his, horse, and, lost, the, battle, recipes, for, mayonnaise, date, to, the, early, nineteenth, century, in, 1815, louis, eustache, ude, wrote, no, 58, mayonnaise, take, three, spoonfuls, of, allemande, six, ditto, of, aspic, and, two, of, oil, add, a, little, tarragon, vinegar, that, has, not, boiled, some, pepper, and, salt, and, minced, ravigotte, or, merely, some, parsley, then, put, in, the, members, of, fowl, or, fillets, of, soles, c, your, mayonnaise, must, be, put, to, ice, neither, are, you, to, put, the, members, into, your, sauce, till, it, begins, to, freeze, next, dish, your, meat, or, fish, mask, with, the, sauce, before, it, be, quite, frozen, and, garnish, your, dish, with, whatever, you, think, proper, as, beet, root, jelly, nasturtiums, c, in, an, 1820, work, viard, describes, something, like, the, more, familiar, emulsified, version, this, sauce, is, made, to, take, in, many, ways, with, raw, egg, yolks, with, gelatine, with, veal, or, veal, brain, glaze, the, most, common, method, is, to, take, a, raw, egg, yolk, in, a, small, terrine, with, a, little, salt, and, lemon, juice, take, a, wooden, spoon, turn, it, while, letting, a, trickle, of, oil, fall, and, stirring, constantly, as, your, sauce, thickens, add, a, little, vinegar, put, in, too, a, pound, of, good, oil, serve, your, sauce, with, good, salt, serve, it, white, or, green, adding, green, of, ravigote, or, green, of, spinach, this, sauce, is, used, for, cold, fish, entrees, or, salad, of, vegetables, cooked, in, salt, water, in, february, 1856, the, huddersfield, chronicle, and, west, yorkshire, advertiser, published, a, recipe, for, homemade, mayonnaise, in, a, segment, entitled, the, housewife, s, corner, this, recipe, included, six, egg, yolks, half, a, bottle, of, olive, oil, volume, not, otherwise, defined, and, one, half, teaspoon, of, vinegar, the, serving, suggestion, was, to, pour, this, over, roast, chicken, or, turkey, with, garnish, of, lettuce, and, hard, eggs, modern, mayonnaise, can, be, made, by, hand, with, a, whisk, a, fork, or, with, the, aid, of, an, electric, mixer, or, blender, it, is, made, by, slowly, adding, oil, to, an, egg, yolk, while, whisking, vigorously, to, disperse, the, oil, the, oil, and, the, water, in, the, yolk, form, a, base, of, the, emulsion, while, lecithin, and, protein, from, the, yolk, is, the, emulsifier, that, stabilizes, it, a, combination, of, van, der, waals, interactions, and, electrostatic, repulsion, determine, the, bond, strength, among, oil, droplets, the, high, viscosity, of, mayonnaise, is, attributed, to, the, total, strength, created, by, these, two, intermolecular, forces, addition, of, mustard, contributes, to, the, taste, and, further, stabilizes, the, emulsion, as, mustard, contains, small, amounts, of, lecithin, if, vinegar, is, added, directly, to, the, yolk, it, can, emulsify, more, oil, thus, making, more, mayonnaise, for, large, scale, preparation, of, mayonnaise, where, mixing, equipment, is, being, employed, the, process, typically, begins, with, the, dispersal, of, eggs, either, powdered, or, liquid, into, water, once, emulsified, the, remaining, ingredients, are, then, added, and, vigorously, mixed, until, completely, hydrated, and, evenly, dispersed, oil, is, then, added, as, rapidly, as, it, can, be, absorbed, though, only, a, small, part, of, the, total, ingredients, other, than, the, oil, are, critical, to, proper, formulation, these, must, be, totally, hydrated, and, dispersed, within, a, small, liquid, volume, which, can, cause, difficulties, including, emulsion, breakdown, during, the, oil, adding, phase, often, a, long, agitation, process, is, required, to, achieve, proper, dispersal, emulsification, presenting, one, of, the, trickiest, phases, of, the, production, process, as, food, technology, advances, processing, has, been, shortened, drastically, allowing, about, 1000, liters, to, be, produced, in, 10, minutes, miracle, whip, was, developed, as, a, less, expensive, imitation, of, mayonnaise, lacking, sufficient, oil, it, does, not, meet, the, legal, definition, of, mayonnaise, and, so, is, marketed, as, salad, dressing, egg, free, imitations, of, mayonnaise, are, available, for, vegans, and, others, who, avoid, eggs, or, cholesterol, or, who, have, egg, allergies, in, the, u, s, these, imitations, cannot, be, labelled, as, mayonnaise, because, the, definition, of, mayonnaise, requires, egg, egg, free, imitations, generally, contain, soya, or, pea, protein, as, the, emulsifying, agent, to, stabilize, oil, droplets, in, water, well, known, brands, include, nasoya, s, nayonaise, vegenaise, and, just, mayo, in, north, america, and, plamil, egg, free, in, the, united, kingdom, mayonnaise, is, used, commonly, around, the, world, and, is, also, a, base, for, many, other, chilled, sauces, and, salad, dressings, for, example, sauce, r, moulade, in, classic, french, cuisine, is, a, mix, of, mayonnaise, and, mustard, gherkins, capers, parsley, chervil, tarragon, and, possibly, anchovy, essence, chile, is, the, world, s, third, major, per, capita, consumer, of, mayonnaise, and, first, in, latin, america, commercial, mayonnaise, became, widely, accessible, in, the, 1980s, it, is, a, common, topping, for, completos, guidelines, issued, in, september, 1991, by, europe, s, federation, of, the, condiment, sauce, industries, recommend, that, mayonnaise, should, contain, at, least, 70, oil, and, 5, liquid, egg, yolk, the, netherlands, incorporated, this, guideline, in, 1998, into, the, law, warenwetbesluit, gereserveerde, aanduidingen, in, article, 4, most, available, brands, easily, exceed, these, targets, in, countries, influenced, by, french, culture, mustard, is, also, a, common, ingredient, that, acts, as, an, additional, emulsifier, japanese, mayonnaise, is, typically, made, with, rice, vinegar, which, gives, it, a, flavor, different, from, mayonnaise, made, from, distilled, vinegar, apart, from, salads, it, is, popular, with, dishes, such, as, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and, yakisoba, and, may, also, accompany, katsu, and, karaage, it, is, most, often, sold, in, soft, plastic, squeeze, bottles, its, texture, is, thicker, than, most, western, commercial, mayonnaise, kewpie, q, p, is, the, most, popular, brand, of, japanese, mayonnaise, advertised, with, a, kewpie, doll, logo, the, vinegar, is, a, proprietary, blend, containing, apple, and, malt, vinegars, the, kewpie, company, was, started, in, 1925, by, tochiro, nakashima, whose, goal, was, to, create, a, condiment, that, made, eating, vegetables, more, enjoyable, mayonnaise, is, very, popular, in, russia, where, it, is, made, with, sunflower, oil, and, soybean, oil, a, 2004, study, showed, that, russia, is, the, only, market, in, europe, where, more, mayonnaise, than, ketchup, is, sold, it, is, used, as, a, sauce, in, the, most, popular, salads, in, russia, such, as, olivier, salad, also, known, as, russian, salad, dressed, herring, and, many, others, leading, brands, are, calv, marketed, by, unilever, and, sloboda, marketed, by, efko, commercial, mayonnaise, marketed, in, jars, originated, in, philadelphia, in, 1907, when, amelia, schlorer, began, marketing, a, mayonnaise, recipe, originally, used, in, salads, sold, in, her, family, s, grocery, store, mrs, schlorer, s, mayonnaise, was, an, instant, success, with, local, customers, and, eventually, grew, into, the, schlorer, delicatessen, company, around, the, same, time, in, new, york, city, a, family, from, vetschau, germany, at, richard, hellmann, s, delicatessen, on, columbus, avenue, featured, his, wife, s, homemade, recipe, in, salads, sold, in, their, delicatessen, the, condiment, quickly, became, so, popular, that, hellmann, began, selling, it, in, wooden, boats, that, were, used, for, weighing, butter, in, 1912, mrs, hellmann, s, mayonnaise, was, mass, marketed, and, was, trademarked, in, 1926, as, hellmann, s, blue, ribbon, mayonnaise, after, numerous, corporate, iterations, hellmann, s, is, now, marketed, in, the, eastern, united, states, and, as, best, foods, mayonnaise, in, the, western, united, states, mayonnaise, sales, are, about, us, 1, 3, billion, per, year, in, the, u, s, a, typical, formulation, for, commercially, made, mayonnaise, not, low, fat, can, contain, as, much, as, 80, vegetable, oil, typically, soybean, rapeseed, sunflower, or, corn, oil, depending, on, region, of, production, but, in, specialty, products, sometimes, olive, or, avocado, oil, water, makes, up, about, 7, to, 8, and, egg, yolks, about, 6, some, formulas, use, whole, eggs, instead, of, just, yolks, the, remaining, ingredients, include, vinegar, 4, salt, 1, and, sugar, 1, low, fat, formulas, will, typically, decrease, oil, content, to, just, 50, and, increase, water, content, to, about, 35, egg, content, is, reduced, to, 4, and, vinegar, to, 3, sugar, is, increased, to, 1, 5, and, salt, lowered, to, 0, 7, gums, or, thickeners, 4, are, added, to, increase, viscosity, improve, texture, and, ensure, a, stable, emulsion, mayonnaise, is, prepared, using, several, methods, but, on, average, it, contains, around, 700, kilocalories, 2, 900, kj, per, 100, grams, or, 94, kilocalories, cal, per, tablespoon, this, makes, mayonnaise, a, calorically, dense, food, the, nutrient, content, of, mayonnaise, 50, edible, oil, 9, 11, salt, 7, 10, sugar, in, the, aqueous, phase, makes, it, suitable, as, a, food, source, for, many, spoilage, organisms, a, set, of, conditions, such, as, ph, between, 3, 6, and, 4, 0, and, low, water, activity, a, w, of, 0, 925, restricts, the, growth, of, yeasts, a, few, bacteria, and, molds, yeasts, of, the, genus, saccharomyces, lactobacillus, fructivorans, and, zygosaccharomyces, bailii, are, the, species, responsible, for, the, spoilage, of, mayonnaise, the, characteristics, of, spoilage, caused, by, z, bailli, are, product, separation, and, a, yeasty, odor, a, study, suggests, that, adding, encapsulated, cells, of, bifidobacterium, bifidum, and, b, infantis, prolongs, the, life, of, mayonnaise, up, to, 12, weeks, without, microorganism, spoilage, mayonnaise, both, commercially, processed, and, home, made, has, been, associated, with, illnesses, from, salmonella, globally, the, source, of, the, salmonella, has, been, confirmed, to, be, raw, eggs, several, outbreaks, with, fatal, cases, have, been, recorded, with, a, few, major, incidents, in, a, 1955, outbreak, in, denmark, 10, 000, people, were, affected, by, salmonella, from, contaminated, mayonnaise, made, by, a, large, kitchen, the, ph, of, the, mayonnaise, was, found, to, be, 5, 1, with, salmonella, counts, of, 180, 000, cfu, g, the, second, outbreak, also, in, denmark, caused, 41, infections, with, two, fatalities, the, ph, of, the, contaminated, mayonnaise, was, 6, 0, with, salmonella, counts, of, 6, million, cfu, g, in, 1976, there, were, serious, salmonellosis, outbreaks, on, four, flights, to, and, from, spain, which, caused, 500, cases, and, 6, fatalities, in, 1984, in, the, us, 404, people, became, ill, and, nine, died, in, a, new, york, city, hospital, due, to, hospital, prepared, mayonnaise, in, all, salmonellosis, cases, the, major, reason, was, inadequate, acidification, of, the, mayonnaise, with, a, ph, higher, than, the, recommended, upper, limit, of, 4, 1, with, acetic, acid, as, the, main, acidifying, agent, some, brands, use, pasteurized, eggs, which, would, reduce, this, risk, factor
