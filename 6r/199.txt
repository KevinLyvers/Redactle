number, of, modern, humans, who, lived, to, be, a, grandparent, increased, it, is, not, known, for, certain, what, spurred, this, increase, in, longevity, but, it, is, generally, believed, that, a, key, consequence, of, three, generations, being, alive, together, was, the, preservation, of, information, which, could, otherwise, have, been, lost, an, example, of, this, important, information, might, have, been, where, to, find, water, in, times, of, drought, in, cases, where, parents, are, unwilling, or, unable, to, provide, adequate, care, for, their, children, e, g, financial, obstacles,

mormor, and, the, father, s, mother, is, termed, farmor, however, the, other, scandinavian, languages, danish, and, norwegian, use, words, which, specify, the, kinship, like, in, swedish, identically, spelled, among, all, three, languages, as, well, as, using, common, terms, similar, to, grandmother, danish, bedstemor, norwegian, bestemor, the, parents, of, a, grandparent, or, the, grandparents,

additional, generation, one, s, great, grandparent, s, parents, would, be, great, great, grandparents, to, avoid, a, proliferation, of, greats, when, discussing, genealogical, trees, one, may, also, use, ordinals, instead, of, multiple, greats, thus, a, great, great, grandfather, would, be, the, second, great, grandfather, and, a, great, great, great, grandfather, would, be, a, third, great, grandfather, and, so, on, this, system, is, used, by, some, genealogical, websites, such, as, geni, one, may, also, use, cardinal, numbers, for, numbering, greats, for, example, great, great, great, grandmother, becomes, 3, great, grandmother, individuals, who, share, the, same, great, grandparents, but, are, not, siblings, or, first, cousins, are, second, cousins, to, each, other, as, second, cousins, have, grandparents, who, are, siblings, similarly, third, cousins, would, have, great, grandparents, who, are, siblings, and, fourth, cousins, would, have, great, great, grandparents, who, are, siblings, the, use, of, the, prefix, grand, dates, from, the, early, 13th, century, from, the, anglo, french, graund, the, term, was, used, as, a, translation, of, latin, magnus, the, prefix, great, represents, a, direct, translation, of, anglo, french, graund, and, latin, magnus, to, english, in, old, english, the, prefixes, ealde, old, and, ieldra, elder, were, used, ealdef, der, m, dor, and, ieldraf, der, m, dor, a, great, grandfather, was, called, a, ridda, f, der, third, father, a, great, great, grandfather, a, f, ower, a, f, der, fourth, father, etc, grandparents, are, changing, their, roles, in, contemporary, world, especially, as, they, are, becoming, increasingly, involved, in, childcare, according, to, a, 2012, study, based, on, 2010, census, and, survey, data, around, 10, of, children, in, the, u, s, live, in, a, household, including, a, grandparent, of, these, approximately, a, third, live, in, a, household, consisting, of, two, parents, and, a, grandparent, likewise, more, than, 40, of, grandparents, across, 11, european, countries, care, for, their, grandchildren, in, the, absence, of, the, parents, in, britain, around, 63, of, grandparents, care, for, their, grandchildren, who, are, under, 16, years, old, grandparent, involvement, is, also, common, in, eastern, societies, for, instance, 48, of, grandparents, in, hong, kong, reported, that, they, are, taking, care, of, their, grandchildren, in, china, around, 58, of, chinese, grandparents, who, are, aged, 45, or, older, are, involved, in, childcare, in, singapore, 40, of, children, from, birth, to, three, years, old, are, cared, by, their, grandparents, and, this, percentage, is, still, increasing, in, south, korea, 53, of, children, under, the, age, of, 6, years, old, are, cared, by, their, grandparents, therefore, grandparents, taking, care, of, their, grandchildren, has, become, a, prevalent, phenomenon, around, the, world, there, are, a, few, reasons, why, grandparent, involvement, is, becoming, more, prevalent, first, life, expectancy, has, increased, while, fertility, rates, have, decreased, this, means, that, more, children, are, growing, up, while, their, grandparents, are, still, alive, and, able, to, become, involved, in, childcare, in, addition, the, reduced, fertility, rates, mean, that, grandparents, can, devote, more, attention, and, resources, to, their, only, grandchildren, second, more, mothers, are, involved, in, the, workforce, and, thus, other, caregivers, need, to, be, present, to, care, for, the, child, for, instance, in, hong, kong, 55, of, grandparents, reported, that, they, took, care, of, their, grandchild, because, his, or, her, parents, have, to, work, in, south, korea, 53, of, working, mother, reported, that, they, once, received, child, care, services, from, their, parents, third, the, increasing, number, of, single, parent, families, creates, a, need, for, grandparental, support, the, degree, of, grandparent, involvement, also, varies, depending, on, the, societal, context, such, as, the, social, welfare, policies, for, example, in, european, countries, such, as, sweden, and, denmark, where, formal, childcare, is, widely, available, grandparents, provide, less, intensive, childcare, by, contrast, in, european, countries, such, as, spain, and, italy, where, formal, childcare, is, limited, and, welfare, payment, is, low, grandparents, provide, more, intensive, childcare, in, singapore, the, grandparent, caregiver, tax, relief, was, established, in, 2004, which, enables, working, parents, singapore, citizens, with, children, age, 12, and, below, whose, children, are, being, cared, for, by, unemployed, grandparents, to, receive, income, tax, relief, of, 3, 000, singaporean, dollars, there, are, different, types, of, grandparental, involvement, including, nonresident, grandparents, co, resident, grandparents, grandparent, maintained, household, and, custodial, grandparents, grandparents, have, different, functions, in, child, development, not, only, do, they, provide, instrumental, support, such, as, picking, grandchildren, up, from, school, or, feeding, them, but, they, also, offer, emotional, support, furthermore, grandparents, protect, children, from, being, impacted, by, negative, circumstances, such, as, harsh, parenting, poor, economic, status, and, single, parent, families, in, addition, to, providing, support, grandparents, can, also, help, grandchildren, with, their, schoolwork, or, teach, them, values, that, are, integral, to, their, society, grandparents, can, have, a, positive, or, negative, impact, on, child, development, on, the, one, hand, previous, research, suggests, that, children, and, adolescents, who, have, a, close, relationship, with, their, grandparents, tend, to, have, better, well, being, experience, fewer, emotional, problems, and, demonstrate, fewer, problematic, behaviours, they, are, also, more, academically, engaged, and, are, more, likely, to, help, others, on, the, other, hand, there, are, also, research, studies, indicating, that, grandparent, involvement, is, associated, with, more, hyperactivity, and, peer, difficulties, among, young, children, in, other, words, children, who, are, cared, for, by, their, grandparents, can, have, more, interpersonal, relationship, problems, also, children, who, are, under, the, care, of, their, grandparents, have, poorer, health, outcomes, such, as, obesity, and, more, injuries, due, to, low, safety, awareness, since, taking, care, of, grandchildren, could, be, a, highly, demanding, job, that, requires, constant, energy, and, time, devotion, grandparental, involvement, in, child, raising, could, have, a, negative, impact, on, grandparents, physical, and, emotional, health, for, example, taking, care, of, grandchildren, can, reduce, grandparents, own, time, for, self, care, such, as, missing, their, medical, appointments, therefore, they, are, likely, to, have, a, higher, chance, to, suffer, from, physical, health, issues, in, the, us, compared, with, those, who, do, not, take, care, of, their, grandchildren, grandparents, who, are, involved, in, childcare, are, more, likely, to, have, poor, physical, conditions, such, as, heart, disease, hypertension, or, body, pain, besides, physical, health, issues, grandparents, are, also, likely, to, have, emotional, issues, to, be, more, specific, raising, young, children, again, could, be, a, stressful, and, overwhelming, experience, and, thus, results, in, different, kinds, of, negative, emotions, such, as, anxiety, or, depression, in, addition, to, physical, and, emotional, issues, grandparents, who, are, involved, in, caring, for, their, grandchildren, can, also, suffer, socially, for, instance, grandparents, will, be, forced, to, limit, their, social, activities, so, as, to, care, for, their, grandchildren, by, doing, so, grandparents, become, more, isolated, from, their, social, relations, taking, care, of, grandchildren, also, means, more, responsibilities, grandparents, would, fear, for, their, grandchildren, s, future, well, being, because, of, their, disability, and, death, in, the, future, if, grandparents, cannot, handle, the, caregiver, role, of, their, grandchildren, well, this, job, can, eventually, become, a, burden, or, stressor, and, bring, more, severe, physical, health, and, emotional, issues, to, grandparents, however, there, are, also, positive, effects, of, being, involved, in, grandchildren, raising, compared, with, grandparents, who, do, not, provide, caregiving, to, their, grandchildren, those, who, take, care, of, their, grandchildren, with, long, hours, are, more, likely, to, have, better, cognitive, functions, to, be, more, specific, taking, care, of, grandchildren, helps, elder, grandparents, maintain, their, mental, capacities, in, later, life, they, are, also, less, likely, to, develop, diseases, such, as, dementia, moreover, frequent, interactions, with, their, grandchildren, could, reduce, the, cognitive, aging, process, allowing, grandparents, a, chance, to, live, a, more, vibrant, and, active, life, grandparents, also, get, benefits, of, physically, exercising, more, during, this, process, taking, care, of, grandchildren, can, also, have, benefits, on, grandparents, emotional, health, as, an, example, many, grandparents, start, to, feel, a, sense, of, purpose, and, meaning, in, life, again, after, their, retirement, as, another, example, their, ties, with, their, adult, children, and, grandchildren, are, also, strengthened, many, grandparents, also, think, of, the, caregiving, experience, as, positive, because, it, provides, another, chance, for, them, to, make, up, mistakes, they, made, with, their, own, children, and, give, them, more, opportunities, to, educate, their, grandchildren, and, improve, their, parenting, styles, grandparental, involvement, differs, between, western, and, eastern, cultures, grandparents, taking, care, of, their, grandchildren, is, a, common, phenomenon, in, china, due, to, chinese, traditions, which, emphasize, family, harmony, collective, well, being, intergenerational, exchanges, and, filial, responsibilities, china, s, unique, philosophies, buddhism, and, taoism, play, important, roles, in, forming, these, cultural, values, while, chinese, buddhism, emphasizes, prioritized, role, of, the, family, in, chinese, society, and, harmonious, relations, among, family, members, taoism, emphasizes, the, importance, of, harmony, in, interpersonal, relations, and, relations, between, nature, and, the, humans, these, philosophies, underline, the, important, role, that, families, play, in, chinese, cultures, besides, cultural, factors, grandparents, taking, care, of, their, grandchildren, also, appears, in, the, context, in, which, their, adult, children, need, to, work, full, time, and, the, child, care, services, are, either, too, expensive, in, big, cities, or, too, scarce, in, remote, areas, grandparents, serving, as, their, grandchildren, s, caregiver, is, particularly, common, in, rural, china, due, to, the, fast, development, of, urbanization, in, china, since, the, 1980s, up, to, 220, million, migrant, workers, from, rural, areas, move, to, urban, areas, to, seek, for, more, job, opportunities, which, leave, around, 58, million, children, behind, in, rural, areas, grandparents, therefore, undertake, the, role, of, parents, and, become, caregivers, to, their, grandchildren, a, new, population, named, left, behind, grandparents, appears, in, this, context, these, grandparents, live, in, rural, china, and, their, main, job, is, to, look, after, their, grandchildren, most, of, these, grandparents, are, facing, financial, burdens, and, wish, their, adult, children, could, come, back, the, mental, and, physical, health, of, left, behind, grandparents, needs, more, attention, from, the, public, even, though, in, urban, areas, where, child, care, services, are, available, nearly, all, grandparents, still, prefer, to, take, care, of, their, grandchildren, voluntarily, not, only, because, this, can, reduce, their, adult, children, s, financial, burdens, on, child, care, services, but, also, taking, care, of, their, own, grandchildren, is, a, more, effective, way, to, maintain, family, harmony, in, the, us, taking, care, of, grandchildren, is, not, a, necessary, responsibility, of, grandparents, grandparents, taking, care, of, their, grandchildren, is, often, caused, by, involuntary, events, or, crisis, and, it, is, more, like, a, solution, to, a, problem, not, an, initiative, desire, which, is, a, distinct, difference, from, that, in, china, for, example, grandparents, in, the, usa, often, take, care, of, their, grandchildren, when, their, adult, children, get, into, troubles, such, as, substance, abuse, incarceration, or, parental, death, differences, also, exist, in, different, ethnicities, in, the, us, caucasian, individuals, generally, regard, individual, independence, as, more, important, so, grandparents, are, less, likely, to, take, care, of, their, grandchildren, however, african, american, and, latino, individuals, are, more, likely, to, regard, looking, after, grandchildren, as, a, family, tradition, and, are, more, willing, to, provide, help, for, their, adult, children, ethnic, differences, in, grandparents, looking, after, their, grandchildren, reflect, different, cultural, values, that, different, ethnic, groups, hold, to, be, more, specific, african, american, grandparents, are, more, likely, to, provide, guidance, and, discipline, to, their, grandchildren, due, to, their, flexible, family, system, in, which, relatives, nonblood, kin, are, all, willing, to, help, each, other, latino, families, have, a, strong, preference, to, live, together, and, keep, frequent, contact, with, family, members, because, most, of, them, are, immigrants, or, first, generation, born, in, the, us, they, are, more, likely, to, live, and, function, as, a, unit, grandparents, in, latino, culture, also, play, important, roles, in, stabilizing, the, family, unit, as, family, leaders, although, caucasian, grandparents, are, less, likely, to, raise, their, grandchildren, they, have, more, cognitive, or, physical, burdens, of, taking, care, of, grandchildren, compared, with, other, ethnic, groups, mainly, because, their, caregiver, roles, are, less, normative, and, they, rely, more, on, remote, or, companionate, parenting, styles, on, the, contrary, african, american, and, latino, grandparents, rely, more, on, disciplinary, and, instructional, parenting, styles, and, they, are, less, likely, to, have, cognitive, or, physical, burdens, when, taking, care, of, their, grandchildren, the, representation, of, grandparents, as, grandparents, is, recent, in, france, diderot, invented, the, verbs, grandp, riser, and, grandm, riser, in, the, 18th, century, victor, hugo, published, l, art, d, tre, grand, p, re, in, 1877, according, to, french, parish, registers, and, civil, status, records, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, a, little, more, than, half, of, the, grandparents, were, alive, at, the, birth, of, their, grandchild, a, third, when, the, child, was, 10, years, old, and, still, 10, at, 20, years, old, in, rural, france, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, majority, of, family, systems, were, of, the, nuclear, family, type, grandparents, did, not, cohabit, in, the, family, home, they, were, only, welcomed, there, at, the, end, of, their, lives, however, in, regions, such, as, alsace, the, west, of, brittany, occitania, or, the, savoy, region, the, systems, were, more, complex, with, the, stem, family, in, particular, the, home, housed, a, succession, of, family, nuclei, the, patriarch, having, authority, over, this, home, which, could, lead, to, conflict, these, cohabitations, were, therefore, managed, from, the, time, of, marriage, by, notarial, acts, that, provided, for, clauses, of, insupport, to, share, the, domestic, space, and, tasks, in, case, of, conflict, in, the, cities, of, the, 19th, century, there, was, generally, no, cohabitation, with, the, exception, of, noble, families, and, their, lineage, logic, a, model, that, declined, after, 1850, but, bourgeois, families, often, housed, all, the, family, branches, in, the, same, building, they, met, with, their, grandparents, at, the, family, home, during, cousinades, while, in, the, working, class, grandparents, lived, in, the, same, neighborhood, family, solidarity, remaining, strong, the, mother, working, outside, the, home, the, children, were, often, cared, for, by, the, grandparents, the, civil, code, recognizes, few, rights, for, grandparents, with, regard, to, parental, authority, in, france, but, case, law, from, the, 1850s, has, influenced, family, legislation, a, court, of, cassation, ruling, on, july, 8, 1857, recognized, the, right, of, grandparents, to, visit, but, this, right, was, only, enshrined, following, the, law, of, january, 4, 1970, as, part, of, a, general, overhaul, of, family, laws, in, france, thus, the, lineage, based, vision, of, grandparents, in, the, 18th, century, was, succeeded, by, the, indulgent, grandparent, vision, in, the, centuries, that, followed, this, is, reflected, in, the, institutionalization, of, visits, and, vacations, with, grandparents, the, use, of, tu, informal, you, by, grandchildren, to, address, grandparents, which, developed, gradually, in, the, 19th, century, the, advent, of, affectionate, names, papi, and, mami, p, p, and, m, m, papet, and, mam, in, the, south, of, france, given, to, the, baby, boomer, generation, from, the, 1970s, or, the, increase, in, grandparental, care, which, marks, a, greater, emotional, closeness, and, the, de, hierarchization, of, relationships, in, switzerland, the, relationship, between, grandchildren, and, grandparents, is, protected, by, article, 274a, of, the, swiss, civil, code, in, exceptional, circumstances, the, right, to, maintain, personal, relations, may, also, be, granted, to, other, persons, in, particular, to, members, of, the, family, provided, that, this, is, in, the, best, interests, of, the, child, grandparents, wishing, to, benefit, from, a, right, of, custody, must, demonstrate, in, court, that, these, exceptional, circumstances, are, effective, as, a, simple, third, party, grandparents, do, not, have, a, legal, right, to, visit, in, switzerland, a, motion, was, rejected, in, september, 2012
