reported, masturbating, in, the, previous, seven, days, the, merck, manual, says, that, 97, of, men, and, 80, of, women, have, masturbated, and, that, generally, speaking, males, masturbate, more, than, females, it, states, that, almost, half, of, the, population, reported, to, have, masturbated, in, the, past, four, weeks, masturbation, is, considered, normal, when, performed, by, children,

gynecologists, giorgio, giorgi, and, marco, siccardi, observed, via, ultrasound, a, female, fetus, possibly, masturbating, and, having, what, appeared, to, be, an, orgasm, popular, belief, asserts, that, individuals, of, either, sex, who, are, not, in, sexually, active, relationships, tend, to, masturbate, more, frequently, than, those, who, are, however, much, of, the, time, this, is, not, true, as, masturbation, alone, or, with, a, partner, is, often, a, feature, of, a, relationship, contrary, to, this, belief, several, studies, actually, reveal, a, positive, correlation, between, the, frequency, of, masturbation, and, the, frequency, of, intercourse, a, study, has, reported, a, significantly, higher, rate, of, masturbation, in, gay, men, and, women, who, were, in, a, relationship,

intercourse, with, more, than, one, male, such, an, orgasm, can, increase, the, likelihood, of, a, pregnancy, by, one, of, them, female, masturbation, can, also, provide, protection, against, cervical, infections, by, increasing, the, acidity, of, the, cervical, mucus, and, by, moving, debris, out, of, the, cervix, in, males, masturbation, flushes, out, old, sperm, with, low, motility, from, the, male, s, genital, tract, the, next, ejaculation, then, contains, proportionally, more, fresh, sperm, which, have, higher, chances, of, achieving, conception, during, intercourse, if, more, than, one, male, has, intercourse, with, a, female, the, sperm, with, the, highest, motility, will, compete, more, effectively, the, american, medical, association, declared, masturbation, to, be, normal, by, consensus, in, 1972, it, does, not, deplete, one, s, body, of, energy, or, cause, premature, ejaculation, the, medical, consensus, is, that, masturbation, is, a, medically, healthy, and, psychologically, normal, habit, according, to, the, merck, manual, of, diagnosis, and, therapy, it, is, considered, abnormal, only, when, it, inhibits, partner, oriented, behavior, is, done, in, public, or, is, sufficiently, compulsive, to, cause, distress, solo, masturbation, is, a, sexual, activity, that, is, nearly, free, of, risk, of, sexually, transmitted, infection, with, two, or, more, participants, the, risk, of, sexually, transmitted, infection, while, not, eliminated, remains, lower, than, with, most, forms, of, penetrative, sex, support, for, such, a, view, and, for, making, masturbation, part, of, the, american, sex, education, curriculum, led, to, the, dismissal, of, us, surgeon, general, joycelyn, elders, during, the, clinton, administration, masturbation, among, adolescents, contributes, to, their, developing, a, sense, of, mastery, over, sexual, impulses, and, it, has, a, role, in, the, physical, and, emotional, development, of, prepubescents, and,

partners, in, a, couple, to, reveal, the, map, to, pleasure, centers, learning, how, they, enjoy, being, touched, when, intercourse, is, inconvenient, or, impractical, mutual, masturbation, affords, couples, the, opportunity, to, obtain, sexual, release, as, often, as, desired, it, is, held, in, many, mental, health, circles, that, masturbation, can, relieve, depression, and, lead, to, a, higher, sense, of, self, esteem, when, one, partner, in, a, relationship, wants, more, sex, than, the, other, masturbation, can, provide, a, balancing, effect, and, promote, a, more, harmonious, relationship, in, 2003, an, australian, research, team, led, by, graham, giles, of, the, cancer, council, australia, found, that, males, who, masturbated, frequently, had, a, lower, probability, of, developing, prostate, cancer, although, they, could, not, demonstrate, a, direct, causation, a, 2008, study, concluded, that, frequent, ejaculation, between, the, ages, of, 20, and, 40, was, correlated, with, higher, risk, of, developing, prostate, cancer, while, frequent, ejaculation, in, the, sixth, decade, of, life, was, found, to, be, correlated, with, a, lower, risk, however, a, larger, 2016, study, found, that, regular, ejaculation, markedly, reduced, prostate, cancer, risk, in, all, age, groups, a, study, published, in, 1997, found, an, inverse, association, between, death, from, coronary, heart, disease, and, frequency, of, orgasm, even, given, the, risk, that, myocardial, ischaemia, and, myocardial, infarction, can, be, triggered, by, sexual, activity, its, authors, stated, the, association, between, frequency, of, orgasm, and, all, cause, mortality, was, also, examined, using, the, midpoint, of, each, response, category, recorded, as, number, of, orgasms, per, year, the, age, adjusted, odds, ratio, for, an, increase, of, 100, orgasms, per, year, was, 0, 64, 0, 44, to, 0, 95, that, is, a, difference, in, mortality, appeared, between, any, two, subjects, when, one, subject, ejaculated, at, around, two, times, per, week, more, than, the, other, assuming, a, broad, range, average, of, between, three, and, five, ejaculations, per, week, for, healthy, males, this, would, mean, five, to, seven, ejaculations, per, week, this, is, consistent, with, a, 2003, paper, that, found, the, strength, of, these, correlations, increased, with, increasing, frequency, of, ejaculation, a, 2008, study, at, tabriz, medical, university, found, that, ejaculation, reduces, swollen, nasal, blood, vessels, freeing, the, airway, for, normal, breathing, the, mechanism, is, through, stimulation, of, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, and, is, long, lasting, the, study, author, suggests, it, can, be, done, time, to, time, to, alleviate, the, congestion, and, the, patient, can, adjust, the, number, of, intercourses, or, masturbations, depending, on, the, severity, of, the, symptoms, sexual, climax, leaves, an, individual, in, a, relaxed, and, contented, state, frequently, followed, by, drowsiness, and, sleep, some, professionals, consider, masturbation, equivalent, to, a, cardiovascular, workout, though, research, remains, scant, those, suffering, from, cardiovascular, disorders, particularly, those, recovering, from, heart, attacks, should, resume, physical, activity, gradually, and, with, the, frequency, and, rigor, which, their, physical, status, will, allow, this, limitation, can, serve, as, encouragement, to, follow, through, with, physical, therapy, sessions, to, help, improve, endurance, in, general, sex, slightly, increases, energy, consumption, masturbation, is, generally, safe, and, complications, are, rare, when, issues, do, occur, they, are, generally, due, to, methodology, or, underlying, psychiatric, illness, those, who, insert, objects, as, aids, to, masturbation, risk, them, becoming, stuck, either, due, to, size, technique, or, anatomy, including, rectal, foreign, bodies, and, urethral, foreign, bodies, causing, damage, such, risks, can, effect, both, men, and, women, with, a, multitude, of, case, reports, available, including, that, of, a, female, who, pierced, her, urethra, after, inserting, two, pencils, during, masturbation, and, the, case, of, a, male, who, required, extensive, treatment, after, inserting, a, pair, of, headphones, into, his, bladder, a, male, whose, penis, is, bluntly, traumatized, during, intercourse, or, masturbation, may, rarely, sustain, a, penile, fracture, or, develop, peyronie, s, disease, in, these, cases, any, energetic, manipulation, of, the, penis, can, cause, discomfort, or, further, damage, a, small, percentage, of, males, experience, postorgasmic, illness, syndrome, pois, which, can, cause, severe, muscle, pain, throughout, the, body, and, other, symptoms, immediately, following, ejaculation, whether, due, to, masturbation, or, partnered, sex, the, symptoms, last, for, up, to, a, week, some, doctors, speculate, that, the, frequency, of, pois, in, the, population, may, be, greater, than, has, been, reported, in, the, academic, literature, and, that, many, cases, are, undiagnosed, compulsive, masturbation, and, other, compulsive, behaviors, can, be, signs, of, an, emotional, problem, which, may, need, to, be, addressed, by, a, mental, health, specialist, as, with, any, nervous, habit, it, is, more, helpful, to, consider, the, causes, of, compulsive, behavior, rather, than, try, to, repress, masturbation, alongside, many, other, factors, such, as, medical, evidence, age, inappropriate, sexual, knowledge, sexualized, play, and, precocious, or, seductive, behavior, excessive, masturbation, may, be, an, indicator, of, sexual, abuse, according, to, dsm, 5, tr, delayed, ejaculation, is, associated, with, highly, frequent,

in, reaction, to, the, 17th, century, libertine, culture, middle, class, moralists, increasingly, campaigned, for, a, reformation, of, manners, and, a, stricter, regulation, of, the, body, paradoxically, a, crime, that, was, secret, and, private, became, a, popular, and, fashionable, topic, moreover, writers, tended, to, focus, more, on, the, perceived, links, with, mental, and, physical, illnesses, that, were, deemed, to, be, associated, with, the, sense, of, moral, outrage, attention, increasingly, shifted, to, the, prevention, and, cure, of, this, illness, which, perilously, sapped, men, of, their, virility, the, first, use, of, the, word, onanism, to, consistently, and, specifically, refer, to, masturbation, is, a, pamphlet, first, distributed, in, london, in, 1716, titled, onania, or, the, heinous, sin, of, self, pollution, and, all, its, frightful, consequences, in, both, sexes, considered, with, spiritual, and, physical, advice, to, those, who, have, already, injured, themselves, by, this, abominable, practice, the, online, etymology, dictionary, however, claims, the, earliest, known, use, of, onanism, occurred, in, 1727, in, 1743, 1745, the, british, physician, robert, james, published, a, medicinal, dictionary, in, which, he, described, masturbation, as, being, productive, of, the, most, deplorable, and, generally, incurable, disorders, and, stated, that, there, is, perhaps, no, sin, productive, of, so, many, hideous, consequences, one, of, the, many, horrified, by, the, descriptions, of, malady, in, onania, was, the, notable, swiss, physician, samuel, auguste, tissot, in, 1760, he, published, l, onanisme, his, own, comprehensive, medical, treatise, on, the, purported, ill, effects, of, masturbation, though, tissot, s, ideas, are, now, considered, conjectural, at, best, his, treatise, was, presented, as, a, scholarly, scientific, work, in, a, time, when, experimental, physiology, was, practically, nonexistent, immanuel, kant, regarded, masturbation, as, a, violation, of, the, moral, law, in, the, metaphysics, of, morals, 1797, he, made, the, a, posteriori, argument, that, such, an, unnatural, use, of, one, s, sexual, attribute, strikes, everyone, upon, his, thinking, of, it, as, a, violation, of, one, s, duty, to, himself, and, suggested, that, it, was, regarded, as, immoral, even, to, give, it, its, proper, name, unlike, the, case, of, the, similarly, undutiful, act, of, suicide, he, went, on, however, to, acknowledge, that, it, is, not, so, easy, to, produce, a, rational, demonstration, of, the, inadmissibility, of, that, unnatural, use, but, ultimately, concluded, that, its, immorality, lay, in, the, fact, that, a, man, gives, up, his, personality, when, he, uses, himself, merely, as, a, means, for, the, gratification, of, an, animal, drive, his, arguments, were, rejected, as, flawed, by, ethicists, of, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, by, 1838, jean, esquirol, had, declared, in, his, des, maladies, mentales, that, masturbation, was, recognized, in, all, countries, as, a, cause, of, insanity, the, medical, literature, of, the, time, also, described, more, invasive, procedures, including, electric, shock, treatment, infibulation, restraining, devices, like, chastity, belts, and, straitjackets, cauterization, or, as, a, last, resort, wholesale, surgical, excision, of, the, genitals, medical, attitudes, toward, masturbation, began, to, change, towards, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, when, h, havelock, ellis, in, his, seminal, 1897, work, studies, in, the, psychology, of, sex, questioned, tissot, s, premises, in, 1905, sigmund, freud, addressed, masturbation, in, his, three, essays, on, the, theory, of, sexuality, and, associated, it, with, addictive, substances, he, described, the, masturbation, of, infants, at, the, period, when, the, infant, is, nursing, at, four, years, of, age, and, at, puberty, at, the, same, time, the, supposed, medical, condition, of, hysteria, from, the, greek, hystera, or, uterus, was, being, treated, by, what, would, now, be, described, as, medically, administered, or, medically, prescribed, masturbation, for, women, in, 1910, the, meetings, of, the, vienna, psychoanalytic, circle, discussed, the, moral, or, health, effects, of, masturbation, but, its, publication, on, the, matter, was, suppressed, concerning, specific, forms, of, masturbation, is, a, 1922, essay, by, another, austrian, the, psychiatrist, and, psychoanalyst, wilhelm, reich, in, the, seven, and, a, half, page, essay, reich, accepts, the, prevalent, notions, on, the, roles, of, unconscious, fantasy, and, the, subsequent, emerging, guilt, feelings, which, he, saw, as, originating, from, the, act, itself, by, 1930, f, w, w, griffin, editor, of, the, scouter, had, written, in, a, book, for, rover, scouts, stating, that, the, temptation, to, masturbate, was, a, quite, natural, stage, of, development, and, citing, ellis, work, held, that, the, effort, to, achieve, complete, abstinence, was, a, very, serious, error, the, work, of, sexologist, alfred, kinsey, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, most, notably, the, kinsey, reports, insisted, that, masturbation, was, an, instinctive, behavior, for, both, males, and, females, in, 1961, the, encyclopedia, of, sexual, behavior, edited, by, albert, ellis, and, albert, abarbanel, declared, that, masturbation, is, normal, and, healthy, at, any, age, in, the, us, masturbation, has, not, been, a, diagnosable, condition, since, dsm, ii, 1968, thomas, szasz, stated, in, 1973, the, shift, in, scientific, consensus, masturbation, the, primary, sexual, activity, of, mankind, in, the, nineteenth, century, it, was, a, disease, in, the, twentieth, it, s, a, cure, in, 2019, encyclop, dia, britannica, endorses, his, conclusion, namely, masturbation, as, a, cure, inside, sex, therapy, d, rner, and, others, wrote, in, their, now, classic, book, 1978, self, satisfaction, is, therefore, a, priceless, good, for, the, success, of, sexual, pleasure, but, also, for, other, partnership, and, sexual, relationships, for, only, if, i, can, offer, something, to, myself, can, i, also, offer, it, to, someone, else, not, self, satisfaction, but, feelings, closely, correlated, with, it, need, among, others, help, through, counseling, respectively, therapy, in, the, 1980s, michel, foucault, was, arguing, masturbation, taboo, was, rape, by, the, parents, of, the, sexual, activity, of, their, children, however, in, 1994, when, the, surgeon, general, of, the, united, states, joycelyn, elders, said, that, it, should, be, mentioned, in, school, sex, education, curricula, as, a, side, note, that, masturbation, is, safe, and, healthy, she, was, forced, to, resign, with, opponents, asserting, that, she, was, promoting, the, teaching, of, how, to, masturbate, thomas, w, laqueur, stated, less, clinical, less, overtly, political, the, solitary, vice, of, the, imagination, and, of, fantasy,

cultural, views, of, masturbation, have, continued, to, evolve, in, the, 21st, century, partly, because, the, contemporary, lifeworld, is, increasingly, technical, for, example, digital, photographs, or, live, video, may, be, used, to, share, masturbatory, experiences, either, in, a, broadcast, format, possibly, in, exchange, of, money, as, with, performances, by, webcam, models, or, between,
