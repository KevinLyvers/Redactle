orienteering, federations, by, 2010, 71, national, orienteering, federations, were, member, societies, of, the, international, orienteering, federation, these, federations, enabled, the, development, of, national, and, world, championships, world, championships, were, held, every, two, years, until, 2003, then, every, year, throughout, this, time, orienteering, has, remained, most, popular, in, scandinavia, there, the, two, oldest, recurring, orienteering, meets, have, been, held, since, the, 1940s, jukola, relay, and, tiomila, and, the, single, largest, orienteering, meet, has, been, held, every, year, since, 1965, and, attracts, around, 15, 000, competitors, o, ringen, typically, orienteering, is, run, in, wild, terrain, in, its, scandinavian, origins, this, typically, meant, in, the,

issom, from, the, mid, 2000s, street, o, has, been, rebranded, as, urban, orienteering, and, has, taken, itself, rather, more, seriously, with, full, colour, maps, and, electronic, punching, and, may, now, be, regarded, as, a, serious, competition, with, inclusion, in, national, ranking, lists, such, urban, races, are, often, much, longer, than, the, sprint, distance, orienteering, sports, combine, significant, navigation, with, a, specific, method, of, travel, because, the, method, of, travel, determines, the, needed, equipment, and, tactics, each, sport, requires, specific, rules, for, competition, and, guidelines, for, orienteering, event, logistics, and, course, design, international, orienteering, federation, the, governing, body, of, the, sport, currently, sanctions, the,

development, and, to, create, and, maintain, an, attractive, world, event, programme, since, 1977, the, iof, has, been, recognised, by, the, ioc, there, are, governing, bodies, for, most, of, the, individual, nations, that, are, represented, in, the, sport, of, orienteering, these, national, bodies, are, the, rule, making, body, for, that, nation, for, example, the, british, orienteering, federation, is, the, national, governing, body, for, the, united, kingdom, the, federation, was, founded, in, 1967, and, it, is, made, up, of, 13, constituent, associations, for, the, united, states, the, national, governing, body, is, orienteering, usa, most, nations, have, some, form, of, regional, governing, bodies, these, are, not, rule, making, bodies, but, are, there, to, assist, in, coordinating, clubs, within, that, region, e, g, they, may, allocate, dates, so, that, clubs, do, not, clash, with, their, events, clubs, are, usually, formed, at, a, local, level, and, affiliated, to, their, national, governing, body, it, is, clubs, who, put, on, events, usually, open, to, all, comers, clubs, may, also, put, on, practice, training, and, social, events, open, clubs, are, open,

offer, a, range, of, courses, of, varying, physical, and, technical, difficulty, to, meet, the, needs, of, competitors, the, orienteering, course, is, marked, in, purple, or, red, on, a, map, a, triangle, is, used, to, indicate, the, start, and, a, double, circle, indicates, the, finish, circles, are, used, to, show, the, control, points, at, international, national, and, the, larger, events, courses, are, classified, by, age, e, g, m35, for, men, 35, years, of, age, and, older, classes, requiring, similar, distances, and, difficulties, are, usually, combined, into, a, smaller, number, of, courses, e, g, m60, will, normally, share, a, course, with, w50, and, often, with, m65, and, w55, the, results, are, normally, arranged, by, class, in, the, smaller, events, courses, are, provided, by, ability, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, use, colour, coding, to, define, the, difficulty, of, the, courses, short, easy, courses, are, provided, for, beginners, and, younger,

restrictions, on, access, e, g, daylight, hours, only, clubs, also, organise, informal, events, for, practice, and, training, control, points, are, placed, on, features, on, the, map, that, can, be, clearly, identified, on, the, ground, control, points, are, marked, in, the, terrain, by, white, and, orange, flags, competitors, receive, a, control, description, sheet, or, clue, sheet, which, gives, a, precise, description, of, the, feature, and, the, location, of, the, kite, e, g, boulder, 5m, north, side, for, experienced, orienteers, the, descriptions, use, symbols, pictorial, in, accordance, with, the, iof, control, descriptions, each, competitor, is, required, to, carry, an, electronic, or, paper, control, card, and, to, present, it, at, the, start, and, hand, it, in, at, the, finish, the, control, card, is, marked, by, some, means, at, each, control, point, to, show, that, the, competitor, has, completed, the, course, correctly, most, events, now, use, electronic, punching, although, cards, and, needle, punches, are, still, widely, used, the, winner, is, normally, the, competitor, with, the, fastest, time, but, other, scoring, systems, can, be, used, e, g, score, events, and, trail, o, most, events, produce, provisional, results, on, the, day, with, draft, results, on, the, internet, that, night, the, final, results, being, confirmed, a, few, days, later, with, electronic, punching, the, results, can, include, split, times, for, competitors, these, show, the, times, between, controls, and, aggregate, times, to, each, control, with, suitable, computer, software, these, times, can, be, displayed, in, a, graphical, form, progressograph, each, competitor, is, responsible, for, his, or, her, own, safety, there, are, no, rules, but, there, are, guidelines, which, should, be, followed, the, basic, safety, check, was, the, stub, check, the, competitor, hands, in, his, stub, at, the, start, and, his, control, card, at, the, finish, event, officials, match, the, two, and, any, unmatched, stubs, represent, a, missing, competitor, this, has, been, superseded, with, electronic, punching, in, that, event, officials, can, now, request, a, still, to, finish, report, listing, all, those, competitors, who, punched, at, the, start, but, have, not, yet, downloaded, their, electronic, card, all, competitors, must, report, to, the, finish, whether, they, have, completed, the, course, or, not, iof, rule, 21, 1, is, that, the, specification, for, clothing, is, delegated, to, the, national, organising, body, and, no, specific, clothing, is, required, unique, among, english, speaking, countries, ireland, and, the, uk, require, legs, to, be, covered, rule, 7, 1, 1, requires, full, body, cover, the, torso, and, legs, must, be, covered, while, organizer, may, allow, shorts, e, g, in, park, or, street, orienteering, in, the, united, states, rule, a, 34, 1, states, that, competitors, are, free, to, choose, clothing, that, they, are, most, comfortable, in, full, leg, cover, is, not, required, unless, specifically, stated, in, the, meet, announcement, in, australia, under, the, 2021, rules, 2, 1, 21, the, choice, of, clothing, is, also, left, up, to, the, competitor, and, full, leg, cover, is, not, required, in, canada, no, specific, clothing, is, required, but, participants, are, encouraged, to, wear, clothing, suitable, for, the, weather, and, hiking, or, running, shoes, similarly, in, new, zealand, there, are, no, rules, in, force, limiting, orienteers, to, running, only, in, full, leg, cover, the, early, competitors, used, standard, athletic, clothing, i, e, shorts, and, an, athletic, vest, which, provided, little, protection, for, racing, through, undergrowth, purpose, made, lightweight, nylon, full, body, suits, were, later, adopted, the, early, o, suits, were, made, in, muted, colours, but, modern, suits, are, generally, multi, coloured, clubs, often, organise, the, bulk, purchase, of, clothing, which, are, then, made, in, the, club, colours, with, the, club, s, name, prominently, displayed, some, competitors, prefer, lycra, tights, or, leggings, gaiters, are, also, often, worn, lightweight, studded, and, often, cleated, orienteering, shoes, are, commonly, used, the, basic, equipment, required, for, orienteering, is, usually, listed, as, a, compass, and, appropriate, outdoor, clothing, most, national, bodies, recommend, that, a, whistle, be, carried, for, safety, reasons, competitive, orienteers, usually, use, specialized, equipment, orienteering, events, can, be, classified, in, many, different, aspects, classic, orienteering, involves, a, race, between, controls, in, a, preset, order, the, winner, is, the, person, who, completes, the, course, in, the, shortest, time, this, is, called, a, cross, country, course, as, distinct, from, a, score, course, see, below, courses, are, normally, designed, so, that, the, fastest, route, is, not, straightforward, to, find, on, the, map, or, to, follow, on, the, ground, the, classic, race, has, a, typical, winning, time, of, 75, 90, minutes, as, of, 2007, the, iof, have, dictated, that, the, classic, course, should, be, redesignated, the, long, the, middle, distance, is, a, shorter, cross, country, race, than, the, classic, or, long, with, a, winning, time, in, the, region, of, 30, minutes, and, with, an, emphasis, more, on, fine, navigation, than, route, choice, when, races, of, this, distance, were, run, in, the, mid, late, 1990s, they, were, called, short, races, or, sprint, o, the, short, distance, was, introduced, as, a, world, championship, discipline, in, 1991, more, recently, though, the, iof, have, renamed, this, distance, as, middle, a, relay, race, is, run, by, a, team, of, competitors, each, running, a, course, and, the, result, is, based, on, the, team, s, total, time, relays, usually, employ, a, mass, start, instead, of, a, staggered, start, relays, are, part, of, world, orienteering, championships, both, as, sprint, relays, and, as, cross, country, relays, additionally, there, are, popular, mass, club, races, out, of, which, jukola, relay, has, the, highest, number, of, participating, clubs, 1, 787, in, 2015, while, 25, manna, has, the, highest, number, of, legs, 25, to, reduce, competitors, following, each, other, various, spreading, methods, might, be, used, this, is, called, gaffling, which, is, a, swedish, word, meaning, forking, the, key, principle, is, that, every, team, must, run, every, leg, between, each, pair, of, two, controls, but, not, necessarily, in, the, same, order, the, iof, have, introduced, the, nomenclature, to, try, to, clarify, the, usage, of, the, word, leg, in, orienteering, usage, leg, normally, refers, to, the, part, of, a, race, between, two, control, points, in, relay, non, orienteering, usage, leg, refers, to, the, part, of, a, race, run, by, a, single, team, member, the, iof, prefer, lap, for, this, latter, term, but, despite, this, in, common, parlance, leg, is, used, for, both, terms, competitors, visit, as, many, controls, as, possible, within, a, time, limit, there, is, usually, a, mass, start, rather, than, staggered, with, a, time, limit, controls, may, have, different, point, values, depending, on, difficulty, and, there, is, a, point, penalty, for, each, minute, late, the, competitor, with, the, most, points, is, the, winner, the, large, scale, endurance, style, version, of, a, score, o, is, known, as, a, rogaine, competed, by, teams, in, events, lasting, often, 24, hours, a, very, large, area, is, used, for, competition, and, the, map, scale, is, smaller, the, format, originated, in, australia, the, term, rogaine, is, often, said, to, stand, for, rugged, outdoor, group, activity, involving, navigation, and, endurance, this, is, essentially, a, backronym, as, the, name, actually, originates, from, the, names, of, rod, gail, and, neil, phillips, who, were, among, australian, rogaining, s, first, participants, very, short, races, with, winning, times, in, the, region, of, 12, 15, minutes, often, held, in, city, parks, and, other, more, urban, settings, map, scales, are, usually, 1, 5, 000, or, 1, 4, 000, control, sites, can, include, benches, litterbins, sculptures, and, other, objects, common, to, urban, parks, the, sprint, distance, may, also, be, held, in, the, forest, when, it, would, be, called, a, forest, sprint, as, opposed, to, an, urban, sprint, this, distance, was, pioneered, in, the, late, 1990s, as, an, elite, event, by, the, park, world, tour, organisation, who, organised, an, independent, world, cup, in, park, sprint, orienteering, in, 2001, in, tampere, the, iof, included, a, sprint, distance, in, the, orienteering, world, championships, ultrasprint, events, are, held, in, a, specially, constructed, labyrinth, due, to, the, limited, area, of, the, labyrinth, ultrasprint, is, a, more, spectator, friendly, form, of, orienteering, also, as, the, course, is, artificial, identical, courses, can, be, set, in, different, geographical, locations, for, simultaneous, local, competitions, as, parts, of, a, larger, tournament, competitors, use, a, headlamp, to, navigate, in, the, dark, reflective, markers, often, are, used, on, control, point, flags, which, shifts, the, tactics, from, precision, navigation, to, searching, competitors, can, travel, at, high, speed, to, the, vicinity, of, the, control, point, then, sweep, the, area, with, the, light, to, catch, a, reflection, off, the, control, flag, if, a, night, event, starts, before, dark, a, mass, start, must, be, used, so, all, competitors, have, equal, time, in, the, light, and, dark, the, two, classic, club, relays, tiomila, and, jukola, both, include, night, legs, full, length, 24, hour, rogaines, and, many, adventure, races, run, through, the, night, without, a, light, period, and, competitors, may, choose, not, to, rest, competitors, follow, a, string, around, a, short, course, noting, down, things, that, they, find, on, the, way, this, is, generally, used, by, young, children, and, people, new, to, the, sport, who, want, to, find, out, what, it, is, like, precision, orienteering, generally, is, not, a, speed, event, but, rather, a, test, of, the, competitors, ability, to, precisely, match, map, and, terrain, examples, include, trail, o, untimed, trec, style, mounted, orienteering, and, radio, orienteering, in, a, compact, area, roca, both, trail, o, and, roca, use, decoys, in, the, vicinity, of, the, control, point, efforts, begun, in, 1996, to, promote, the, inclusion, of, orienteering, in, the, olympic, games, have, so, far, been, unsuccessful, although, orienteering, became, a, sport, in, the, world, games, in, 2001, and, is, a, sport, in, the, summer, deaflympics, supporters, recognize, that, the, sport, is, neither, television, nor, spectator, friendly, the, venue, of, competition, is, often, necessarily, remote, from, major, cities, and, the, duration, of, the, event, is, longer, than, most, other, individual, competitions, efforts, to, develop, a, format, suitable, for, olympic, competitions, have, focused, on, park, orienteering, micro, orienteering, and, short, distance, relays, sprint, orienteering, on, foot, as, a, format, of, the, sport, is, most, likely, to, be, included, in, olympic, games, as, this, discipline, is, becoming, more, and, more, popular, worldwide, and, can, have, a, significant, spectator, interest, according, to, the, website, of, a, chicago, orienteering, club, the, international, orienteering, federation, is, committed, to, entering, the, olympic, world, although, not, an, official, demonstration, sport, an, international, ski, orienteering, event, was, held, in, sugadaira, k, gen, japan, as, part, of, the, international, cultural, festival, held, in, conjunction, with, the, xviii, winter, olympic, games, in, nagano, in, 1998, the, international, orienteering, federation, petitioned, the, international, olympic, committee, in, 2002, to, include, ski, orienteering, in, the, 2006, winter, olympic, games, noting, that, it, could, share, the, venue, with, the, biathlon, competitions, in, its, formal, recommendation, that, ski, orienteering, not, be, included, in, those, games, the, olympic, programme, commission, focused, on, a, lack, of, participation, in, the, sport, outside, nordic, countries, the, challenges, for, broadcasters, and, spectators, to, easily, follow, the, competition, and, the, costs, associated, with, new, technology, and, a, new, results, system, in, 2005, the, international, olympic, committee, confirmed, that, ski, orienteering, was, under, consideration, for, inclusion, in, the, review, process, of, the, olympic, sport, program, for, the, 2014, winter, olympic, games, on, 28, november, 2006, the, executive, board, of, the, ioc, decided, not, to, include, any, new, sports, in, this, review, process, the, world, orienteering, championships,

been, a, part, of, the, world, games, program, since, 2001, as, orienteering, is, a, sport, practiced, primarily, in, europe, the, european, orienteering, championships, is, also, an, important, event, in, the, orienteering, calendar, as, of, 2021, the, european, championships, is, held, in, tandem, with, the, world, championships, with, the, european, championships, hosting, the, sprint, events, when, the, world, championships, hosts, the, forest, events, and, vice, versa, the, annual, orienteering, world, cup, is, hosted, over, a, number, of, events, throughout, the, year, with,

locations, in, finland, jukola, is, the, largest, relay, orienteering, event, in, the, world, jukola, is, considered, equal, to, tiomila, as, the, most, prestigious, event, in, club, orienteering, a, night, relay, with, open, entry, held, in, different, locations, in, sweden, tiomila, is, considered, equal, to, jukola, as, the, most, prestigious, event, in, club, orienteering, finding, the, way, around, the, outdoors, is, still, very, important, when, people, visit, national, parks, or, other, wild, lands, they, need, to, know, where, they, are, going, on, trails, and, paths, over, the, years, nature, changes, trees, grow, and, fall, over, wildfires, occur, and, floods, take, place, therefore, signage, and, environmental, markers, need, to, change, too, in, one, study, national, park, staff, asked, 36, participants, to, think, out, loud, while, going, through, the, park, reading, the, park, map, and, interpreting, signage, throughout, the, park, the, researchers, analyzed,
