said, to, be, a, legal, dissolution, of, a, marriage, by, a, court, or, other, competent, body, it, is, the, legal, process, of, ending, a, marriage, divorce, laws, vary, considerably, around, the, world, but, in, most, countries, divorce, requires, the, sanction, of, a, court, or, other, authority, in, a, legal, process, which, may, involve, issues, of, distribution, of, property, child, custody, alimony, spousal, support, child, visitation, access, parenting, time, child, support, and, division, of, debt, in, most, countries, monogamy, is, required, by, law, so, divorce, allows, each, former, partner, to, marry, another, person, divorce, is, different, from, annulment, which, declares, the, marriage, null, and, void, with, legal, separation, or, de, jure, separation, a, legal, process, by, which, a, married, couple, may, formalize, a, de, facto, separation, while, remaining, legally, married, or, with, de, facto, separation, a, process, where, the, spouses, informally, stop, cohabiting, reasons, for, divorce, vary, from, sexual, incompatibility, or, lack, of, independence, for, one, or, both, spouses, to, a, personality, clash, or, infidelity, the, only, countries, that, do, not, allow, divorce, are, the, philippines, and, the, vatican, city, in, the, philippines, divorce, for, non, muslim, filipinos, is, not, legal, unless, one, spouse, is, an, undocumented, immigrant, and, satisfies, certain, conditions, the, vatican, city, is, a, theocratic, state, ruled, by, the, head, of, the, catholic, church, and, does, not, allow, for, divorce, countries, that, have, relatively, recently, legalized, divorce, are, italy, 1970, portugal, 1975, although, from, 1910, to, 1940, it, was, possible, both, for, the, civil, and, religious, marriage, brazil, 1977, spain, 1981, argentina, 1987, paraguay, 1991, colombia, 1991, from, 1976, was, allowed, only, for, non, catholics, andorra, 1995, ireland, 1996, chile, 2004, and, malta, 2011, grounds, for, divorce, vary, widely, from, country, to, country, marriage, may, be, seen, as, a, contract, a, status, or, a, combination, of, these, where, it, is, seen, as, a, contract, the, refusal, or, inability, of, one, spouse, to, perform, the, obligations, stipulated, in, the, contract, may, constitute, a, ground, for, divorce, for, the, other, spouse, in, contrast, in, some, countries, such, as, sweden, finland, australia, new, zealand, divorce, is, purely, no, fault, this, means, it, does, not, matter, what, the, reasons, are, that, a, party, or, parties, want, to, separate, they, can, separate, of, their, own, free, will, without, having, to, prove, someone, is, at, fault, for, the, divorce, many, jurisdictions, offer, both, the, option, of, a, no, fault, divorce, as, well, as, an, at, fault, divorce, this, is, the, case, for, example, in, many, states, of, the, us, france, and, the, czech, republic, though, divorce, laws, vary, between, jurisdictions, there, are, two, basic, approaches, to, divorce, fault, based, and, no, fault, based, however, even, in, some, jurisdictions, that, do, not, require, a, party, to, claim, fault, of, their, partner, a, court, may, still, take, into, account, the, behavior, of, the, parties, when, dividing, property, debts, evaluating, custody, shared, care, arrangements, and, support, in, some, jurisdictions, one, spouse, may, be, forced, to, pay, the, attorney, s, fees, of, another, spouse, laws, vary, as, to, the, waiting, period, before, a, divorce, is, effective, also, residency, requirements, vary, however, issues, of, division, of, property, are, typically, determined, by, the, law, of, the, jurisdiction, in, which, the, property, is, located, in, europe, divorce, laws, differ, from, country, to, country, reflecting, differing, legal, and, cultural, traditions, in, some, countries, particularly, but, not, only, in, some, former, communist, countries, divorce, can, be, obtained, only, on, one, single, general, ground, of, irretrievable, breakdown, of, the, marriage, or, a, similar, formulation, yet, what, constitutes, such, a, breakdown, of, the, marriage, is, interpreted, very, differently, from, jurisdiction, to, jurisdiction, ranging, from, very, liberal, interpretations, e, g, netherlands, to, quite, restrictive, ones, e, g, in, poland, there, must, be, an, irretrievable, and, complete, disintegration, of, matrimonial, life, but, there, are, many, restrictions, to, granting, a, divorce, separation, constitutes, a, ground, of, divorce, in, some, european, countries, in, germany, e, g, a, divorce, is, granted, on, the, basis, of, a, 1, year, separation, if, both, spouses, consent, or, 3, year, separation, if, only, one, spouse, consents, note, that, separation, does, not, necessarily, mean, separate, residences, in, some, jurisdictions, living, in, the, same, household, but, leading, a, separate, life, e, g, eating, sleeping, socializing, etc, separately, is, sufficient, to, constitute, de, facto, separation, this, is, explicitly, stated, e, g, in, the, family, laws, of, latvia, or, the, czech, republic, divorce, laws, are, not, static, they, often, change, reflecting, evolving, social, norms, of, societies, in, the, 21st, century, many, european, countries, have, made, changes, to, their, divorce, laws, in, particular, by, reducing, the, length, of, the, necessary, periods, of, separation, e, g, scotland, in, 2006, 1, or, 2, years, from, the, previous, 2, or, 5, years, france, in, 2005, 2, years, from, the, previous, 6, years, switzerland, in, 2005, 2, years, from, the, previous, 4, years, greece, in, 2008, 2, years, from, the, previous, 4, years, some, countries, have, completely, overhauled, their, divorce, laws, such, as, spain, in, 2005, and, portugal, in, 2008, a, new, divorce, law, also, came, into, force, in, september, 2007, in, belgium, creating, a, new, system, that, is, primarily, no, fault, bulgaria, also, modified, its, divorce, regulations, in, 2009, also, in, italy, new, laws, came, into, force, in, 2014, and, 2015, with, significant, changes, in, italian, law, in, matter, of, divorce, apart, from, shortening, of, the, period, of, obligatory, separation, 6, months, for, consensual, separations, and, 1, year, for, contested, ones, from, the, previous, 3, years, are, allowed, other, forms, of, getting, a, divorce, as, an, alternative, to, court, proceedings, i, e, the, negotiations, with, the, participation, of, an, advocate, or, agreement, made, before, the, registrar, of, public, registry, office, austria, by, contrast, is, a, european, country, where, the, divorce, law, still, remains, conservative, the, liberalization, of, divorce, laws, is, not, without, opposition, particularly, in, the, united, states, indeed, in, the, us, certain, conservative, and, religious, organizations, are, lobbying, for, laws, which, restrict, divorce, in, 2011, in, the, us, the, coalition, for, divorce, reform, was, established, describing, itself, as, an, organization, dedicated, to, supporting, efforts, to, reduce, unnecessary, divorce, and, promote, healthy, marriages, the, magisterium, of, the, roman, catholic, church, founds, the, concept, of, marriage, on, natural, moral, law, elaborated, by, st, thomas, aquinas, supplemented, by, the, revealed, divine, law, the, doctrine, of, the, doctor, angelicus, has, been, partially, shared, by, the, eastern, orthodox, church, in, the, course, of, history, in, some, jurisdictions, the, courts, will, seldom, apply, principles, of, fault, but, might, willingly, hold, a, party, liable, for, a, breach, of, a, fiduciary, duty, to, his, or, her, spouse, grounds, for, divorce, differs, from, jurisdiction, to, jurisdiction, in, the, worldwide, some, states, have, no, fault, divorce, some, states, require, a, declaration, of, fault, on, the, part, of, one, partner, or, both, some, states, allow, either, method, in, most, jurisdictions, a, divorce, must, be, certified, or, ordered, by, a, judge, in, a, court, of, law, to, come, into, effect, the, terms, of, the, divorce, are, usually, determined, by, the, courts, though, they, may, take, into, account, prenuptial, agreements, or, post, nuptial, agreements, or, ratify, terms, that, the, spouses, may, have, agreed, to, privately, while, in, other, areas, agreements, related, to, the, marriage, have, to, be, rendered, in, writing, to, be, enforceable, in, the, absence, of, agreement, a, contested, divorce, may, be, stressful, to, the, spouses, in, some, countries, when, the, spouses, agree, to, divorce, and, to, the, terms, of, the, divorce, it, can, be, certified, by, a, non, judiciary, administrative, entity, the, effect, of, a, divorce, is, that, both, parties, are, free, to, marry, again, if, a, filing, in, an, appellate, court, does, not, overturn, the, decision, contested, divorces, mean, that, one, of, several, issues, are, required, to, be, heard, by, a, judge, at, trial, level, this, is, more, expensive, and, the, parties, will, have, to, pay, for, a, lawyer, s, time, and, preparation, in, such, a, divorce, the, spouses, are, not, able, to, agree, on, issues, for, instance, child, custody, and, division, of, marital, assets, in, such, situations, the, litigation, process, takes, longer, to, conclude, the, judge, controls, the, outcome, of, the, case, less, adversarial, approaches, to, divorce, settlements, have, recently, emerged, such, as, mediation, and, collaborative, divorce, settlement, which, negotiate, mutually, acceptable, resolution, to, conflicts, this, principle, in, the, united, states, is, called, alternative, dispute, resolution, and, has, gained, popularity, before, the, late, 1960s, nearly, all, countries, that, permitted, divorce, required, proof, by, one, party, that, the, other, party, had, committed, an, act, incompatible, with, the, marriage, this, was, termed, grounds, for, divorce, popularly, called, fault, and, was, the, only, way, to, terminate, a, marriage, no, fault, divorce, is, available, in, australia, new, zealand, canada, the, united, states, and, other, western, countries, fault, based, divorces, can, be, contested, evaluation, of, offences, may, involve, allegations, of, collusion, of, the, parties, working, together, to, get, the, divorce, or, condonation, by, approving, the, offence, connivance, by, tricking, someone, into, committing, an, offence, or, provocation, by, the, other, party, contested, fault, divorces, can, be, expensive, and, not, usually, practical, as, eventually, most, divorces, are, granted, comparative, rectitude, is, a, doctrine, used, to, determine, which, spouse, is, more, at, fault, when, both, spouses, are, guilty, of, breaches, the, grounds, for, a, divorce, which, a, party, could, raise, and, need, to, prove, included, the, requirement, of, proving, a, ground, was, revised, and, withdrawn, by, the, terms, of, no, fault, statutes, which, became, popular, in, many, western, countries, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, in, no, fault, jurisdictions, divorce, can, be, obtained, either, on, a, simple, allegation, of, irreconcilable, differences, irretrievable, break, down, or, incompatibility, with, respect, to, the, marriage, relationship, or, on, the, ground, of, de, facto, separation, a, summary, or, simple, divorce, available, in, some, jurisdictions, is, used, when, spouses, meet, certain, eligibility, requirements, or, can, agree, on, key, issues, beforehand, key, factors, most, western, jurisdictions, have, a, no, fault, divorce, system, in, which, a, divorce, can, be, granted, based, only, on, the, assertion, by, one, of, the, parties, that, the, marriage, has, broken, down, irretrievably, without, any, need, for, an, allegation, or, proof, of, fault, the, application, can, be, made, by, either, party, or, by, both, parties, jointly, in, jurisdictions, adopting, the, no, fault, principle, some, courts, may, still, take, fault, into, account, when, determining, some, aspects, of, the, terms, of, the, divorce, decree, for, example, the, division, of, property, and, debts, and, provision, of, spousal, support, some, behaviors, that, may, constitute, marital, fault, such, as, violence, cruelty, or, substance, abuse, may, also, be, considered, when, determining, child, custody, but, child, custody, judgements, are, made, based, on, a, different, fundamental, standard, the, child, s, or, children, s, best, interests, it, is, estimated, that, upwards, of, 95, of, divorces, in, the, u, s, are, uncontested, because, the, two, parties, are, able, to, come, to, an, agreement, either, with, or, without, lawyers, mediators, collaborative, counsel, about, the, property, children, and, support, issues, this, is, also, known, as, mutual, consent, divorce, or, simply, mutual, divorce, when, the, parties, can, agree, and, present, the, court, with, a, fair, and, equitable, agreement, approval, of, the, divorce, is, typically, guaranteed, if, the, two, parties, cannot, come, to, an, agreement, they, may, ask, the, court, to, decide, how, to, split, property, and, deal, with, the, custody, of, their, children, though, this, may, be, necessary, the, courts, would, prefer, parties, to, come, to, an, agreement, prior, to, entering, court, where, the, issues, are, not, complex, and, the, parties, are, cooperative, a, settlement, often, can, be, directly, negotiated, between, them, in, the, majority, of, cases, forms, are, acquired, from, their, respective, state, websites, and, a, filing, fee, is, paid, to, the, state, most, u, s, states, charge, between, 175, and, 350, for, a, simple, divorce, filing, collaborative, divorce, and, mediated, divorce, are, considered, uncontested, divorces, in, the, united, states, many, state, court, systems, are, experiencing, an, increasing, proportion, of, pro, se, i, e, litigants, represent, themselves, without, a, lawyer, in, divorce, cases, for, example, courts, in, urban, areas, of, california, report, that, almost, 80, of, new, divorces, are, filed, pro, se, collaborative, divorce, is, a, method, for, divorcing, couples, to, come, to, an, agreement, on, divorce, issues, in, a, collaborative, divorce, the, parties, negotiate, an, agreed, resolution, with, the, assistance, of, attorneys, who, are, trained, in, the, collaborative, divorce, process, and, in, mediation, and, often, with, the, assistance, of, a, neutral, financial, specialist, or, divorce, coaches, the, parties, are, empowered, to, make, their, own, decisions, based, on, their, own, needs, and, interests, but, with, complete, information, and, full, professional, support, once, the, collaborative, divorce, starts, the, lawyers, are, disqualified, from, representing, the, parties, in, a, contested, legal, proceeding, should, the, collaborative, law, process, end, prematurely, most, attorneys, who, practise, collaborative, divorce, claim, that, it, can, be, more, cost, effective, than, other, divorce, methods, e, g, going, to, court, portugal, for, example, allows, two, persons, to, file, an, electronic, request, for, no, fault, collaborative, divorce, in, a, non, judiciary, administrative, entity, in, specific, cases, with, no, children, real, property, alimony, or, common, address, can, be, completed, within, one, hour, divorce, mediation, is, an, alternative, to, traditional, divorce, litigation, in, a, divorce, mediation, session, a, mediator, facilitates, the, discussion, between, the, two, parties, by, assisting, with, communication, and, providing, information, and, suggestions, to, help, resolve, differences, at, the, end, of, the, mediation, process, the, separating, parties, have, typically, developed, a, tailored, divorce, agreement, that, can, be, submitted, to, the, court, mediation, sessions, can, include, either, party, s, attorneys, a, neutral, attorney, or, an, attorney, mediator, who, can, inform, both, parties, of, their, legal, rights, but, does, not, provide, advice, to, either, or, can, be, conducted, with, the, assistance, of, a, facilitative, or, transformative, mediator, without, attorneys, present, at, all, some, mediation, companies, such, as, wevorce, also, pair, clients, with, counselors, financial, planners, and, other, professionals, to, work, through, common, mediation, sticking, points, divorce, mediators, may, be, attorneys, who, have, experience, in, divorce, cases, or, they, may, be, professional, mediators, who, are, not, attorneys, but, who, have, training, specifically, in, the, area, of, family, court, matters, divorce, mediation, can, be, significantly, less, costly, both, financially, and, emotionally, than, litigation, the, adherence, rate, to, mediated, agreements, is, much, higher, than, that, of, adherence, to, court, orders, polygamy, is, a, significant, structural, factor, governing, divorce, in, countries, where, this, is, permitted, little, to, no, analysis, has, been, completed, to, explicitly, explain, the, link, between, marital, instability, and, polygyny, which, leads, to, divorce, the, frequency, of, divorce, rises, in, polygynous, marriages, compared, to, monogamous, relationships, within, polygynous, unions, differences, in, conjugal, stability, are, found, to, occur, by, wife, order, there, are, 3, main, mechanisms, through, which, polygyny, affects, divorce, economic, restraint, sexual, satisfaction, and, childlessness, many, women, escape,

and, administers, marriages, and, divorces, while, ceremonies, may, be, performed, by, religious, officials, on, behalf, of, the, state, a, civil, marriage, and, thus, civil, divorce, without, the, involvement, of, a, religion, is, also, possible, due, to, differing, standards, and, procedures, a, couple, can, be, legally, unmarried, married, or, divorced, by, the, state, s, definition, but, have, a, different, status, as, defined, by, a, religious, order, other, countries, use, religious, law, to, administer, marriages, and, divorces, eliminating, this, distinction, in, these, cases,

united, states, this, trend, is, mirrored, in, the, uk, where, a, recent, study, into, web, search, behavior, found, that, 70, of, divorce, inquiries, were, from, women, these, findings, also, correlate, with, the, office, for, national, statistics, publication, divorces, in, england, and, wales, 2012, which, reported, that, divorce, petitions, from, women, outnumber, those, from, men, by, 2, to, 1, regarding, divorce, settlements, according, to, the, 2004, grant, thornton, survey, in, the, uk, women, obtained, a, better, or, considerably, better, settlement, than, men, in, 60, of, cases, in, 30, of, cases, the, assets, were, split, 50, 50, and, in, only, 10, of, cases, did, men, achieve, better, settlements, down, from, 24, the, previous, year, the, report, concluded, that,

marry, non, mamzerim, in, the, western, world, as, a, whole, two, thirds, of, divorces, are, initiated, by, women, in, the, united, states, 69, of, divorces, are, initiated, by, women, and, this, may, be, due, to, higher, sensitivity, to, relationship, difficulties, an, annual, study, in, the, uk, by, management, consultants, grant, thornton, estimates, the, main, proximate, causes, of, divorce, based, on, surveys, of, matrimonial, lawyers, the, main, causes, in, 2004, were, according, to, this, survey, husbands, engaged, in, extramarital, affairs, in, 75, of, cases, and, wives, in, 25, in, cases, of, family, strain, wives, families, were, the, primary, source, of, strain, in, 78, compared, to, 22, of, husbands, families, emotional, and, physical, abuse, were, more, evenly, split, with, wives, affected, in, 60, and, husbands, in, 40, of, cases, in, 70, of, workaholism, related, divorces, it, was, husbands, who, were, the, cause, and, in, 30, wives, the, 2004, survey, found, that, 93, of, divorce, cases, were, petitioned, by, wives, very, few, of, which, were, contested, 53, of, divorces, were, marriages, that, had, lasted, 10, to, 15, years, with, 40, ending, after, 5, to, 10, years, the, first, 5, years, are, relatively, divorce, free, and, if, a, marriage, survives, more, than, 20, years, it, is, unlikely, to, end, in, divorce, social, scientists, study, the, causes, of, divorce, in, terms, of, underlying, factors, that, may, motivate, divorce, one, of, these, factors, is, the, age, at, which, a, person, gets, married, delaying, marriage, may, provide, more, opportunity, or, experience, in, choosing, a, compatible, partner, wage, income, and, sex, ratios, are, other, such, underlying, factors, that, have, been, included, in, analyses, by, sociologists, and, economists, couples, with, a, high, household, income, are, less, likely, to, divorce, than, poor, couples, other, personal, factors, such, as, attending, religious, services, regularly, and, having, at, least, one, child, together, also, reduce, the, risk, of, divorce, other, factors, include, the, wedding, itself, spending, relatively, little, money, on, the, wedding, but, having, a, relatively, high, number, of, guests, in, attendance, e, g, 50, or, more, people, and, going, on, a, honeymoon, trip, is, associated, with, a, lower, risk, of, divorce, high, cost, weddings, may, strain, marriages, by, causing, debt, stress, the, elevation, of, divorce, rates, among, couples, who, cohabited, before, marriage, is, called, the, cohabitation, effect, evidence, suggests, that, although, this, correlation, is, partly, due, to, two, forms, of, selection, a, that, persons, whose, moral, or, religious, codes, permit, cohabitation, are, also, more, likely, to, consider, divorce, permitted, by, morality, or, religion, and, b, that, marriage, based, on, low, levels, of, commitment, is, more, common, among, couples, who, cohabit, than, among, couples, who, do, not, such, that, the, mean, and, median, levels, of, commitment, at, the, start, of, marriage, are, lower, among, cohabiting, than, among, non, cohabiting, couples, the, cohabitation, experience, itself, exerts, at, least, some, independent, effect, on, the, subsequent, marital, union, in, 2010, a, study, by, jay, teachman, published, in, journal, of, marriage, and, family, found, that, women, who, have, cohabited, or, had, premarital, sex, with, men, other, than, their, husbands, have, an, increased, risk, of, divorce, and, that, this, effect, is, strongest, for, women, who, have, cohabited, with, multiple, men, before, marriage, to, teachman, the, fact, that, the, elevated, risk, of, divorce, is, only, experienced, when, the, premarital, partner, s, is, someone, other, than, the, husband, indicates, that, premarital, sex, and, cohabitation, are, now, a, normal, part, of, the, courtship, process, in, the, united, states, this, study, only, considers, data, on, women, in, the, 1995, national, survey, of, family, growth, in, the, united, states, divorce, is, sometimes, caused, by, one, of, the, partners, finding, the, other, unattractive, recent, studies, show, that, the, cohabitation, effect, on, divorce, varies, across, different, cultures, and, periods, another, article, published, in, journal, of, marriage, and, family, found, that, when, cohabitation, was, uncommon, in, pre, reform, china, premarital, cohabitation, increased, the, likelihood, of, subsequent, divorce, but, this, association, disappeared, when, cohabitation, became, prevalent, women, are, six, times, more, likely, to, be, separated, or, divorced, soon, after, a, diagnosis, of, cancer, or, multiple, sclerosis, than, men, a, review, found, a, small, decrease, of, divorce, rate, associated, with, most, cancer, types, but, stated, methodological, weakness, for, many, published, studies, which, studied, the, association, between, divorce, and, cancer, some, of, the, effects, associated, with, divorce, include, academic, behavioral, and, psychological, problems, although, this, may, not, always, be, true, studies, suggest, that, children, from, divorced, families, are, more, likely, to, exhibit, such, behavioral, issues, than, non, divorced, families, research, done, at, northern, illinois, university, on, family, and, child, studies, suggests, that, divorce, of, couples, experiencing, high, conflict, can, positively, affect, families, by, reducing, conflict, in, the, home, there, are, however, many, instances, when, the, parent, child, relationship, may, suffer, due, to, divorce, financial, support, is, many, times, lost, when, an, adult, goes, through, a, divorce, the, adult, may, be, obligated, to, obtain, additional, work, to, maintain, financial, stability, this, can, lead, to, a, negative, relationship, between, the, parent, and, child, the, relationship, may, suffer, due, to, a, lack, of, attention, towards, the, child, and, minimal, parental, supervision, studies, have, also, shown, that, parental, skills, decrease, after, a, divorce, occurs, however, this, effect, is, only, a, temporary, change, many, researchers, have, shown, that, a, disequilibrium, including, diminished, parenting, skills, occurs, in, the, year, following, the, divorce, but, that, by, two, years, after, the, divorce, re, stabilization, has, occurred, and, parenting, skills, have, improved, some, couples, choose, divorce, even, when, one, spouse, s, desire, to, remain, married, is, greater, than, the, other, spouse, s, desire, to, obtain, a, divorce, in, economics, this, is, known, as, the, zelder, paradox, and, is, more, familiar, with, marriages, that, have, produced, children, and, less, common, with, childless, couples, research, has, also, found, that, recent, divorcees, report, significantly, higher, hostility, levels, after, the, divorce, than, before, and, that, this, effect, applies, equally, to, both, male, and, female, divorcees, in, an, american, psychological, association, study, of, parents, relocation, after, a, divorce, researchers, found, that, a, move, has, a, long, term, effect, on, children, in, the, first, study, conducted, amongst, 2, 000, college, students, on, the, effects, of, parental, relocation, relating, to, their, children, s, well, being, after, divorce, researchers, found, major, differences, in, divorced, families, in, which, one, parent, moved, the, students, received, less, financial, support, from, their, parents, compared, with, divorced, families, in, which, neither, parent, moved, these, findings, also, imply, other, negative, outcomes, for, these, students, such, as, more, distress, related, to, the, divorce, and, did, not, feel, a, sense, of, emotional, support, from, their, parents, although, the, data, suggests, negative, outcomes, for, these, students, whose, parents, relocate, after, divorce, there, is, insufficient, research, that, can, alone, prove, the, overall, well, being, of, the, child, a, newer, study, in, the, journal, of, family, psychology, found, that, parents, who, move, more, than, an, hour, away, from, their, children, after, a, divorce, are, much, less, well, off, than, those, parents, who, stayed, in, the, same, location, research, has, shown, that, children, are, greatly, affected, by, the, disunion, of, their, parents, marriage, in, most, cases, these, effects, are, displayed, in, academic, strain, difficulty, in, regulating, mood, and, emotions, and, a, tendency, to, find, outlets, in, harmful, substances, or, activities, such, as, drugs, alcohol, and, violence, frequently, children, who, have, experienced, a, parental, divorce, have, lower, academic, achievement, than, children, from, non, divorced, families, a, review, of, family, and, school, factors, related, to, adolescents, academic, performance, noted, that, a, child, from, a, divorced, family, is, two, times, more, likely, to, drop, out, of, high, school, than, a, child, from, a, non, divorced, family, these, children, from, divorced, families, may, also, be, less, likely, to, attend, college, resulting, in, the, end, of, their, academic, career, often, academic, problems, are, associated, with, children, from, single, parent, families, studies, have, shown, that, this, may, be, directly, related, to, the, economic, effect, of, divorce, a, divorce, may, result, in, the, parent, and, children, moving, to, an, area, with, a, higher, poverty, rate, and, a, poor, education, system, because, of, the, financial, difficulties, of, a, single, parent, children, of, divorced, parents, also, on, average, achieve, lower, levels, of, socioeconomic, status, income, and, wealth, accumulation, than, children, of, parents, who, remain, married, these, outcomes, are, associated, with, lower, educational, achievement, young, men, or, women, between, the, ages, of, 7, and, 16, who, had, experienced, the, divorce, of, their, parents, were, more, likely, than, youths, who, had, not, experienced, the, divorce, of, their, parents, to, leave, home, because, of, friction, to, cohabit, before, marriage, and, to, parent, a, child, before, marriage, divorce, often, leads, to, worsened, academic, achievement, in, children, ages, 7, 12, the, most, heightened, negative, effect, being, reading, test, scores, these, negative, effects, tend, to, persist, and, even, escalate, after, the, divorce, or, separation, occurs, divorce, is, associated, with, diminished, psychological, well, being, in, children, and, adult, offspring, of, divorced, parents, including, greater, unhappiness, less, satisfaction, with, life, weaker, sense, of, personal, control, anxiety, depression, and, greater, use, of, mental, health, services, a, preponderance, of, evidence, indicates, that, there, is, a, causal, effect, between, divorce, and, these, outcomes, a, study, in, sweden, led, by, the, centre, for, health, equity, studies, chess, at, stockholm, university, karolinska, institutet, is, published, in, the, journal, of, epidemiology, community, health, found, that, children, living, with, just, one, parent, after, divorce, suffer, from, more, problems, such, as, headaches, stomach, aches, feelings, of, tension, and, sadness, than, those, whose, parents, share, custody, children, of, divorced, parents, are, also, more, likely, to, experience, conflict, in, their, own, marriages, and, are, more, likely, to, experience, divorce, themselves, they, are, also, more, likely, to, be, involved, in, short, term, cohabiting, relationships, which, often, dissolve, before, marriage, there, are, many, studies, that, show, proof, of, an, intergenerational, transmission, of, divorce, but, this, does, not, mean, that, having, divorced, parents, will, absolutely, lead, a, child, to, divorce, there, are, two, key, factors, that, make, this, transmission, of, divorce, more, likely, first, inherited, biological, tendencies, or, genetic, conditions, may, predispose, a, child, to, divorce, as, well, as, the, model, of, marriage, presented, by, the, child, s, parents, according, to, nicholas, wall, former, president, of, the, family, division, of, the, english, high, court, people, think, that, post, separation, parenting, is, easy, in, fact, it, is, exceedingly, difficult, and, as, a, rule, of, thumb, my, experience, is, that, the, more, intelligent, the, parent, the, more, intractable, the, dispute, there, is, nothing, worse, for, most, children, than, for, their, parents, to, denigrate, each, other, parents, simply, do, not, realize, the, damage, they, do, to, their, children, by, the, battles, they, wage, over, them, separating, parents, rarely, behave, reasonably, although, they, always, believe, that, they, are, doing, so, and, that, the, other, party, is, behaving, unreasonably, children, involved, in, high, conflict, divorce, or, custody, cases, can, experience, varying, forms, of, psychological, distress, due, to, conflict, between, their, parents, legal, professionals, recognize, that, alienating, behaviors, are, common, in, child, custody, cases, but, are, cautious, about, accepting, the, concept, of, parental, alienation, research, shows, that, children, can, be, affected, 2, 4, years, before, the, separation, or, divorce, even, occurs, this, can, be, due, to, parental, conflict, and, anticipation, of, a, divorce, and, decreased, parental, contact, many, couples, believe, that, by, separating, or, becoming, legally, divorced, that, they, are, helping, their, children, and, in, situations, of, extreme, parental, conflict, or, abuse, it, most, likely, will, be, beneficial, exposure, to, marital, conflict, and, instability, most, often, has, negative, consequences, for, children, several, mechanisms, are, likely, to, be, responsible, first, observing, overt, conflict, between, parents, is, a, direct, stressor, for, children, observational, studies, reveal, that, children, react, to, inter, parental, conflict, with, fear, anger, or, the, inhibition, of, normal, behavior, preschool, children, who, tend, to, be, egocentric, may, blame, themselves, for, marital, conflict, resulting, in, feelings, of, guilt, and, lowered, self, esteem, conflict, between, parents, also, tends, to, spill, over, and, negatively, affect, the, quality, of, parents, interactions, with, their, children, researchers, found, that, the, associations, between, marital, conflict, and, children, s, externalizing, and, internalizing, problems, were, largely, mediated, by, parents, use, of, harsh, punishment, and, parent, child, conflict, furthermore, modeling, verbal, or, physical, aggression, parents, teach, their, children, that, disagreements, are, resolved, through, conflict, rather, than, calm, discussion, as, a, result, children, may, not, learn, the, social, skills, such, as, the, ability, to, negotiate, and, reach, compromises, that, are, necessary, to, form, mutually, rewarding, relationships, with, peers, girls, and, boys, deal, with, divorce, differently, for, instance, girls, who, initially, show, signs, of, adapting, well, later, suffer, from, anxiety, in, romantic, relationships, with, men, studies, also, showed, that, girls, who, were, separated, from, their, fathers, at, a, younger, age, tended, to, be, angrier, toward, the, situation, as, they, aged, anger, and, sadness, were, also, observed, as, common, feelings, in, adolescents, who, had, experienced, parental, divorce, children, of, divorced, or, separated, parents, exhibit, increased, behavioral, problems, and, the, marital, conflict, that, accompanies, parents, divorce, places, the, child, s, social, competence, at, risk, children, of, divorced, parents, are, more, likely, to, search, for, outlets, to, cope, with, their, emotions, for, many, struggling, with, social, understanding, and, concepts, of, abuse, or, a, lack, of, love, in, the, home, drug, abuse, and, general, misconduct, or, violence, are, some, of, the, indulgences, that, these, children, may, be, involved, in, in, the, united, states, of, america, since, the, mid, 1990s, the, divorce, rate, has, increased, to, over, 50, among, baby, boomers, more, and, more, seniors, are, staying, single, an, analysis, of, census, data, conducted, at, bowling, green, state, university, predicted, that, divorce, numbers, would, continue, to, rise, baby, boomers, who, remain, unmarried, are, five, times, more, likely, to, live, in, poverty, than, those, who, are, married, they, are, also, three, times, as, likely, to, receive, food, stamps, public, assistance, or, disability, payments, sociologists, believe, that, the, rise, in, the, number, of, older, americans, who, are, not, married, is, a, result, of, factors, such, as, longevity, and, economics, women, especially, are, becoming, more, and, more, financially, independent, which, allows, them, to, feel, more, secure, with, being, alone, in, addition, to, changing, perceptions, of, being, divorced, or, single, this, has, resulted, in, less, pressure, for, baby, boomers, to, marry, or, stay, married, china, currently, holds, one, of, the, highest, divorce, rates, in, the, asia, pacific, region, compared, to, 2000, china, s, divorce, rates, have, gone, up, substantially, from, a, 0, 96, crude, divorce, rate, to, 3, 09, rate, in, 2020, while, china, s, divorce, rate, has, been, increasing, since, 2000, the, highest, recorded, crude, divorce, rate, in, the, past, 20, years, was, in, 2019, with, 3, 36, divorces, however, since, 2019, china, s, recorded, divorce, rate, has, gone, down, china, has, no, fault, divorce, which, was, implemented, through, the, new, marriage, law, in, 1950, this, allows, individuals, to, divorce, without, showing, any, evidence, of, wrongdoing, china, is, one, of, the, only, asian, countries, which, permits, no, fault, divorce, as, of, january, 2021, china, introduced, a, new, policy, called, the, cooling, off, rule, china, seeing, the, rise, in, divorce, rates, increasing, on, a, yearly, basis, the, marriage, and, family, edition, of, civil, code, of, the, people, s, republic, of, china, secured, an, article, 1077, establishing, a, mandatory, cooling, off, period, which, has, two, requirements, first, on, the, day, in, which, authorities, have, received, the, divorce, applications, both, parties, can, withdraw, the, registration, within, 30, days, and, additionally, to, that, after, 30, days, are, up, couples, are, required, to, physically, apply, for, divorce, certificate, and, if, they, do, not, show, up, the, initial, divorce, application, will, be, automatically, perceived, as, withdrawn, this, novel, policy, has, been, extremely, controversial, where, couples, are, required, to, wait, for, at, least, 30, days, before, they, can, commence, a, divorce, the, 30, day, cooling, off, period, is, created, with, the, aim, of, generating, more, social, stability, which, avoids, couples, from, making, rushed, or, in, the, heat, of, the, moment, emotionally, charged, decisions, family, stability, has, always, been, culturally, rooted, in, china, influenced, by, confucian, beliefs, where, the, harmony, of, family, brings, the, success, of, everything, a, divorce, can, only, be, granted, when, couples, have, gone, through, a, one, month, long, delay, in, order, to, make, a, decision, since, the, implementation, of, the, cooling, off, rule, china, s, ministry, of, civil, affairs, discovered, as, sharp, 72, per, cent, drop, in, divorce, rates, since, the, last, quarter, given, the, 30, days, of, cooling, off, time, many, couples, have, changed, their, minds, supporting, the, argument, that, most, divorce, decisions, are, made, irrationally, and, emotionally, although, there, has, been, a, positive, effect, to, reduce, divorce, in, the, country, chinese, citizens, are, not, responding, well, to, the, cooling, off, policy, which, concerns, women, in, marriages, experiencing, domestic, abuse, in, fact, from, china, digital, times, a, woman, by, the, name, of, kan, xiaofang, died, of, domestic, abuse, because, when, she, filed, for, divorce, in, 2021, she, had, to, wait, 30, days, for, the, divorce, to, be, finalized, she, was, hacked, to, death, by, her, husband, the, 30, day, rule, has, angered, chinese, feminists, who, believes, that, the, policy, undermines, the, concept, of, freedom, and, does, not, take, into, consideration, of, domestic, violence, which, runs, common, within, chinese, households, the, cooling, off, policy, is, still, relatively, new, today, only, being, less, than, 2, years, old, therefore, this, policy, is, still, one, that, needs, to, be, examined, more, deeply, to, analyze, the, effect, and, consequences, of, delaying, the, divorce, process, india, has, one, of, the, lowest, divorce, rates, in, the, world, with, around, 1, of, marriages, ending, in, divorce, mainly, because, divorce, is, still, stigmatized, and, seen, as, taboo, amongst, a, lot, of, families, in, india, a, lot, of, individuals, also, split, without, choosing, to, go, through, the, process, of, divorce, even, though, it, was, considered, as, a, taboo, in, 1980s, nowadays, people, s, mindset, has, started, to, change, and, taboo, against, divorce, has, reduced, mutual,

those, of, the, same, faith, in, fact, in, a, 1993, study, members, of, two, mainline, protestant, religions, had, a, 20, chance, of, being, divorced, in, 5, years, a, 33, for, a, catholic, and, evangelical, and, a, 40, chance, for, a, jew, and, a, christian, couples, with, different, ethnicities, and, races, also, had, distinctive, divorce, statistics, in, 2008, a, study, by, jenifer, l, bratter, and, rosalind, b, king, on, the, education, resources, information, center, found, that, unions, between, white, males, and, non, white, females, as, well, as, between, hispanics, and, non, hispanic, individuals, have, similar, or, lower, risks, of, divorce, than, white, marriages, unions, between, a, white, male, and, black, female, last, longer, than, white, white, pairings, or, white, asian, pairings, conversely, a, white, female, with, a, black, male, and, white, female, with, an, asian, male, are, more, prone, to, divorce, than, white, white, pairings, additionally, as, found, in, 2010, success, in, marriage, has, been, associated, with, a, higher, education, and, older, age, for, example, 81, of, college, graduates, who, were, over, 26, years, old, who, wed, in, the, 1980s, were, still, married, 20, years, later, additionally, 65, of, college, graduates, under, 26, who, married, in, the, 1980s, were, still, married, 20, years, later, furthermore, 49, of, high, school, graduates, under, 26, years, old, who, married, in, the, 1980s, were, still, married, 20, years, later, conversely, 2, 9, of, adults, aged, 35, 39, and, without, a, college, degree, got, divorced, in, the, year, 2009, compared, with, 1, 6, with, a, college, education, another, study, looking, at, population, differences, found, that, a, 1, increase, in, the, unemployment, rate, correlated, with, a, 1, decrease, in, the, divorce, rate, this, was, found, to, be, presumably, true, for, individuals, who, were, financially, challenged, when, trying, to, afford, the, legal, proceedings, nevertheless, another, study, from, 1900, to, 2008, found, that, there, was, a, significant, increase, in, the, risk, of, divorce, following, a, layoff, and, being, unemployed, the, crude, divorce, rate, in, australia, in, 2020, was, 1, 9, divorces, per, 1, 000, residents, this, rate, has, remained, somewhat, consistent, throughout, the, past, few, years, and, is, the, same, as, the, previous, year, however, as, divorces, are, granted, after, 12, months, of, separation, splits, during, covid, may, not, be, reflected, in, the, current, divorce, rate, the, divorce, rate, has, decreased, substantially, over, the, past, 20, years, with, 2, 6, divorces, recorded, per, 1, 000, residents, in, 2000, in, order, to, apply, for, divorce, one, must, be, separated, for, at, least, 12, months, new, zealand, s, divorce, rate, in, 2020, was, 7, 6, divorces, per, 1, 000, residents, this, rate, marks, a, decrease, from, previous, years, such, as, those, in, 1983, with, a, crude, divorce, rate, of, 13, 3, in, fact, this, rate, has, decreased, significantly, from, the, previous, year, 2019, with, a, divorce, rate, of, 8, 4, before, filing, for, divorce, the, parties, must, be, separated, for, at, least, two, years, after, this, time, either, party, is, able, to, submit, an, application, if, it, is, a, joint, application, but, the, parties, do, not, appear, in, court, a,

divorce, will, be, effective, immediately, if, one, party, applies, as, a, sole, application, then, the, other, spouse, has, the, opportunity, to, defend, it, within, a, certain, time, period, according, to, statistics, south, africa, the, number, of, divorces, increased, by, 0, 3, from, 25, 260, divorces, granted, in, 2015, to, 25, 326, granted, in, 2016, about, 44, 4, of, the, 2016,

such, as, ghana, uganda, nigeria, and, kenya, south, asian, countries, including, india, and, pakistan, and, south, east, asian, countries, such, as, the, philippines, and, indonesia, the, majority, of, the, population, considers, divorce, acceptable, in, europe, latin, america, and, the, united, states, divorce, is, also, widely, accepted, in, certain, muslim, majority, countries, such, as,

germany, in, 2017, consequently, there, have, been, relatively, few, studies, of, divorce, by, same, sex, couples, and, they, have, produced, some, conflicting, information, in, some, countries, such, as, norway, and, sweden, lesbian, couples, may, be, more, likely, to, divorce, than, gay, couples, or, opposite, sex, couples, same, sex, couples, in, rural, areas, may, have, a, higher, divorce,

spouses, child, custody, policies, include, several, guidelines, that, determine, with, whom, the, child, lives, following, divorce, how, time, is, divided, in, joint, custody, situations, and, visitation, rights, the, most, frequently, applied, custody, guideline, is, the, best, interests, of, the, child, standard, which, takes, into, account, the, parents, preferences, the, child, s, preferences, the, interactions, between, parents, and, children, children, s, adjustment, and, all, family, members, mental, and, physical, health, rather, than, being, conceived, as, a, legal, procedure, divorce, in, classical, athens, was, largely, thought, to, be, a, private, matter, defined, by, law, but, with, no, specific, legal, action, required, to, divorce, his, wife, an, athenian, man, need, only, to, dismiss, her, by, sending, her, back, to, her, family, it, is, unknown, what, would, have, constituted, socially, acceptable, grounds, for, divorce, save, for, the, fact, that, it, was, required, by, law, for, men, to, divorce, adulterous, women, the, procedure, for, divorce, was, considerably, more, difficult, for, women, in, order, to, initiate, divorce, athenian, women, were, required, to, appear, in, public, before, the, archon, to, state, their, case, this, procedure, was, a, considerable, exception, to, standard, athenian, legal, conventions, which, barred, women, from, representing, themselves, in, court, as, woman, initiated, divorce, proceedings, required, a, woman, to, represent, herself, as, a, matter, of, public, record, divorce, was, rare, in, early, roman, culture, but, as, their, empire, grew, in, power, and, authority, roman, civil, law, embraced, the, maxim, matrimonia, debent, esse, libera, marriages, ought, to, be, free, and, either, husband, or, wife, could, renounce, the, marriage, at, will, the, christian, emperors, constantine, and, theodosius, restricted, the, grounds, for, divorce, to, grave, cause, but, this, was, relaxed, by, justinian, in, the, 6th, century, in, post, classical, mali, laws, relating, to, divorced, women, were, documented, in, the, timbuktu, manuscripts, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, familial, life, was, regulated, more, by, ecclesiastical, authority, than, civil, authority, the, catholic, and, orthodox, church, had, among, others, a, differing, view, of, divorce, the, orthodox, church, recognized, that, there, are, rare, occasions, when, it, is, better, that, couples, do, separate, for, the, orthodox, to, say, that, marriage, is, indissoluble, means, that, it, should, not, be, broken, the, violation, of, such, a, union, perceived, as, holy, being, an, offense, resulting, from, either, adultery, or, the, prolonged, absence, of, one, of, the, partners, thus, permitting, remarriage, is, an, act, of, compassion, of, the, church, towards, sinful, man, under, the, influence, of, the, catholic, church, the, divorce, rate, had, been, greatly, reduced, by, the, 9th, or, 10th, century, which, considered, marriage, a, sacrament, instituted, by, jesus, christ, and, indissoluble, by, mere, human, action, although, divorce, as, known, today, was, generally, prohibited, in, catholic, lands, after, the, 10th, century, separation, of, husband, and, wife, and, the, annulment, of, marriage, were, well, known, what, is, today, referred, to, as, separate, maintenance, or, legal, separation, was, termed, divorce, a, mensa, et, thoro, divorce, from, bed, and, board, the, husband, and, wife, physically, separated, and, were, forbidden, to, live, or, cohabit, together, but, their, marital, relationship, did, not, fully, terminate, civil, courts, had, no, power, over, marriage, or, divorce, the, grounds, for, annulment, were, determined, by, a, catholic, church, authority, and, applied, in, ecclesiastical, courts, annulment, was, for, canonical, causes, of, impediment, existing, at, the, time, of, the, marriage, for, in, cases, of, total, divorce, the, marriage, is, declared, null, as, having, been, absolutely, unlawful, ab, initio, the, catholic, church, held, that, the, sacrament, of, marriage, produced, one, person, from, two, inseparable, from, each, other, by, marriage, the, husband, and, wife, are, one, person, in, law, that, is, the, very, being, of, legal, existence, of, the, woman, is, suspended, during, the, marriage, or, at, least, incorporated, and, consolidated, into, that, of, the, husband, under, whose, wing, protection, and, cover, she, performs, everything, since, husband, and, wife, became, one, person, upon, marriage, recognition, of, that, oneness, could, be, rescinded, only, on, the, grounds, that, the, unity, never, existed, to, begin, with, i, e, that, the, proclamation, of, marriage, was, erroneous, and, void, from, the, start, after, the, reformation, marriage, came, to, be, considered, a, contract, in, the, newly, protestant, regions, of, europe, and, on, that, basis, civil, authorities, gradually, asserted, their, power, to, decree, a, divortium, a, vinculo, matrimonii, or, divorce, from, all, the, bonds, of, marriage, since, no, precedents, existed, defining, the, circumstances, under, which, marriage, could, be, dissolved, civil, courts, heavily, relied, on, the, previous, determinations, of, the, ecclesiastic, courts, and, freely, adopted, the, requirements, set, down, by, those, courts, as, the, civil, courts, assumed, the, power, to, dissolve, marriages, courts, still, strictly, construed, the, circumstances, under, which, they, would, grant, a, divorce, and, considered, divorce, to, be, contrary, to, public, policy, because, divorce, was, considered, to, be, against, the, public, interest, civil, courts, refused, to, grant, a, divorce, if, evidence, revealed, any, hint, of, complicity, between, the, husband, and, wife, to, divorce, or, if, they, attempted, to, manufacture, grounds, for, a, divorce, divorce, was, granted, only, because, one, party, to, the, marriage, had, violated, a, sacred, vow, to, the, innocent, spouse, if, both, husband, and, wife, were, guilty, neither, would, be, allowed, to, escape, the, bonds, of, marriage, eventually, the, idea, that, a, marriage, could, be, dissolved, in, cases, in, which, one, of, the, parties, violated, the, sacred, vow, gradually, allowed, expansion, of, the, grounds, upon, which, divorce, could, be, granted, from, those, grounds, which, existed, at, the, time, of, the, marriage, to, grounds, which, occurred, after, the, marriage, but, which, exemplified, violation, of, that, vow, such, as, abandonment, adultery, or, extreme, cruelty, an, exception, to, this, trend, was, the, anglican, church, which, maintained, the, doctrine, of, marital, indissolubility, during, the, english, civil, war, the, puritans, briefly, passed, a, law, that, divested, marriage, of, all, sacrament, leaving, it, as, a, secular, contract, that, could, be, broken, john, milton, wrote, four, divorce, tracts, in, 1643, 1645, that, argued, for, the, legitimacy, of, divorce, on, grounds, of, spousal, incompatibility, his, ideas, were, ahead, of, their, time, arguing, for, divorce, at, all, let, alone, a, version, of, no, fault, divorce, was, extremely, controversial, and, religious, figures, sought, to, ban, his, tracts, in, 1670, a, precedent, was, first, set, with, an, act, of, parliament, allowing, lord, john, manners, to, divorce, his, wife, lady, anne, pierrepont, and, until, the, passage, of, the, matrimonial, causes, act, 1857, divorce, could, only, be, obtained, through, a, specific, act, of, parliament, the, move, towards, secularisation, and, liberalisation, was, reinforced, by, the, individualistic, and, secular, ideals, of, the, enlightenment, the, enlightened, absolutist, king, frederick, ii, the, great, of, prussia, decreed, a, new, divorce, law, in, 1752, in, which, marriage, was, declared, to, be, a, purely, private, concern, allowing, divorce, to, be, granted, on, the, basis, of, mutual, consent, this, new, attitude, heavily, influenced, the, law, in, neighbouring, austria, under, emperor, joseph, ii, where, it, was, applied, to, all, non, catholic, imperial, subjects, divorce, was, legalised, in, france, after, the, french, revolution, on, a, similar, basis, although, the, legal, order, of, the, ancien, regime, was, reinstated, at, the, bourbon, restoration, of, 1816, the, trend, in, europe, throughout, the, 19th, century, was, one, of, increased, liberalisation, by, the, mid, 19th, century, divorce, was, generally, granted, by, civil, courts, in, the, case, of, adultery, in, britain, before, 1857, wives, were, regarded, as, under, the, economic, and, legal, protection, of, their, husbands, and, divorce, was, almost, impossible, it, required, a, very, expensive, private, act, of, parliament, costing, perhaps, 200, of, the, sort, only, the, richest, could, possibly, afford, it, was, very, difficult, to, secure, divorce, on, the, grounds, of, adultery, desertion, or, cruelty, the, first, key, legislative, victory, came, with, the, matrimonial, causes, act, 1857, which, passed, over, the, strenuous, opposition, of, the, highly, traditional, church, of, england, the, new, law, made, divorce, a, civil, affair, of, the, courts, rather, than, a, church, matter, with, a, new, civil, court, in, london, handling, all, cases, the, process, was, still, quite, expensive, at, about, 40, but, now, became, feasible, for, the, middle, class, a, woman, who, obtained, a, judicial, separation, took, the, status, of, a, feme, sole, with, full, control, of, her, own, civil, rights, additional, amendments, came, in, 1878, which, allowed, for, separations, handled, by, local, justices, of, the, peace, the, church, of, england, blocked,
