the, 1960, summer, paralympics, with, the, rise, of, numerous, regional, championships, and, the, growth, in, olympic, style, multi, sport, events, such, as, the, commonwealth, games, and, pan,

by, professionalism, as, a, result, the, amateur, athletic, union, was, dissolved, in, the, us, and, replaced, with, a, non, amateur, body, focused, on, the, sport, of, athletics, the, athletics, congress, later, usa, track, and, field, the, iaaf, abandoned, amateurism, in, 1982, and, later, rebranded, itself, as, the, international, association, of, athletics, federations, while, western, countries, were, limited, to, amateurs, until, the, 1980s, the, soviet, bloc, always, fielded, state, funded, athletes, who, trained, full, time, putting, american, and, western, european, athletes,

competitions, the, profile, of, the, sport, reached, an, apogee, in, the, 1980s, with, a, number, of, athletes, becoming, household, names, like, carl, lewis, sergey, bubka, sebastian, coe, zola, budd, and, florence, griffith, joyner, many, world, records, were, broken, then, and, the, added, political, element, between, competitors, of, the, united, states, east, germany, and, the, soviet, union, during, the, cold, war, only, served, to, stoke, the, sport, s, popularity, the, rising, commerciality, of, track, and, field, was, also, met, with, developments, in, sports, science, and, there, were, transformations, in, coaching, methods, athlete, s, diets, training, facilities, and, sports, equipment, the, use, of, performance, enhancing, drugs, also, increased, state, sponsored, doping, in, 1970s, and, 1980s, east, germany, china, the, soviet, union, and, early, 21st, century, russia, as, well, as, prominent, individual, cases, such, as, those, of, olympic, gold, medallists, ben, johnson, and, marion, jones, damaged, the, public, image, and, marketability, of, the, sport, from, the, 1990s, onward, track, and, field, became, increasingly, more, professional, and, international, as, the, iaaf, gained, over, 200, member, nations, the, iaaf, world, championships, in, athletics, became, a, fully, professional, competition, with, the, introduction, of, prize,

ever, worldwide, annual, series, of, track, and, field, meetings, track, and, field, events, are, divided, into, three, categories, track, events, field, events, and, combined, events, the, majority, of, athletes, tend, to, specialize, in, one, event, type, with, the, aim, of, perfecting, their, performances, although, the, aim, of, combined, events, athletes, is, to, become, proficient, in, a, number, of, disciplines, track, events, involve, running, on, a, track, over, specified, distances, and, in, the, case, of, the, hurdling, and, steeplechase, events, surmounting, obstacles, there, are, also, relay, races, in, which, teams, of, athletes, run, and, pass, on, a, baton, to, their, team, members, at, the, end, of, a, certain, distance, there, are, two, types, of, field, events, jumps, and, throws, in, jumping, competitions, athletes, are, judged, on, either, the, length, or, height, of, the, jumps, the, performances, of, jumping, events, for, distance, are, measured, from, a, board, or, marker, and, overstepping, this, mark, is, judged, as, a, foul, in, the, jumps, for, height, an, athlete, must, clear, their, body, over, a, crossbar, without, knocking, the, bar, off, the, supporting, standards, the, majority, of, jumping, events, are, unaided, although, athletes, propel, themselves, vertically, with, purpose, built, sticks, in, the, pole, vault, the, throwing, events, involve, hurling, an, implement, such, as, a, heavyweight, javelin, or, discus, from, a, set, point, with, athletes, being, judged, on, the, distance, that, the, object, is, thrown, combined, events, involve, the, same, group, of, athletes, contesting, a, number, of, different, track, and, field, events, points, are, given, for, their, performance, in, each, event, and, the, athlete, or, team, with, the, highest, score, at, the, end, of, all, events, is, the, winner, races, over, short, distances, or, sprints, are, among, the, oldest, running, competitions, the, first, 13, editions, of, the, ancient, olympic, games, featured, only, one, event, the, stadion, race, which, was, a, race, from, one, end, of, the, stadium, to, the, other, sprinting, events, are, focused, on, athletes, reaching, and, sustaining, their, quickest, possible, running, speed, three, sprinting, events, are, currently, held, at, the, olympics, and, outdoor, world, championships, the, 100, 200, and, 400, metres, these, events, have, their, roots, in, races, of, imperial, measurements, that, later, changed, to, metric, the, 100, metres, evolved, from, the, 100, yard, dash, the, 200, m, distances, came, from, the, furlong, or, 1, 8, of, a, mile, and, the, 400, m, was, the, successor, to, the, 440, yard, dash, or, quarter, mile, race, at, the, professional, level, sprinters, begin, the, race, by, assuming, a, crouching, position, in, the, starting, blocks, before, leaning, forward, and, gradually, moving, into, an, upright, position, as, the, race, progresses, and, momentum, is, gained, athletes, remain, in, the, same, lane, on, the, running, track, throughout, all, sprinting, events, with, the, sole, exception, of, the, indoor, 400, m, races, up, to, 100, m, are, largely, focused, upon, acceleration, to, an, athlete, s, maximum, speed, all, sprints, beyond, this, distance, increasingly, incorporate, an, element, of, endurance, human, physiology, dictates, that, a, runner, s, near, top, speed, cannot, be, maintained, for, more, than, thirty, seconds, or, so, because, lactic, acid, builds, up, once, leg, muscles, begin, to, suffer, oxygen, deprivation, top, speed, can, only, be, maintained, for, up, to, 20, metres, the, 60, metres, is, a, common, indoor, event, and, indoor, world, championship, event, less, common, events, include, the, 50, 55, 300, and, 500, metres, which, are, run, in, some, high, school, and, collegiate, competitions, in, the, united, states, the, 150, metres, though, rarely, competed, has, a, star, studded, history, pietro, mennea, set, a, world, best, in, 1983, olympic, champions, michael, johnson, and, donovan, bailey, went, head, to, head, over, the, distance, in, 1997, and, usain, bolt, improved, mennea, s, record, in, 2009, the, most, common, middle, distance, track, events, are, the, 800, metres, 1500, metres, and, mile, run, although, the, 3000, metres, may, also, be, classified, as, a, middle, distance, event, the, 880, yard, run, or, half, mile, was, the, forebear, of, the, 800, m, distance, and, it, has, its, roots, in, competitions, in, the, united, kingdom, in, the, 1830s, the, 1500, m, came, about, as, a, result, of, running, three, laps, of, a, 500, m, track, which, was, commonplace, in, continental, europe, in, the, 20th, century, middle, distance, events, can, begin, in, one, of, two, ways, a, staggered, start, or, a, waterfall, start, in, the, 800, meter, race, athletes, begin, in, individual, lanes, that, are, staggered, before, the, turn, runners, must, remain, in, their, lanes, for, the, first, 100, m, before, cutting, in, to, run, as, a, pack, this, rule, was, introduced, to, reduce, jostling, between, runners, in, the, early, stages, of, the, race, the, 1500, meter, and, longer, events, typically, use, a, waterfall, start, where, runners, start, the, race, from, a, standing, position, along, a, curved, starting, line, and, then, immediately, cut, in, towards, the, innermost, track, to, follow, the, quickest, route, to, the, finish, physiologically, middle, distance, events, demand, that, athletes, have, good, aerobic, and, anaerobic, energy, producing, systems, and, also, that, they, have, strong, endurance, the, 1500, m, and, mile, run, events, have, historically, been, some, of, the, most, prestigious, track, and, field, events, swedish, rivals, gunder, h, gg, and, arne, andersson, broke, each, other, s, 1500, m, and, mile, world, records, on, a, number, of, occasions, in, the, 1940s, the, prominence, of, the, distances, were, maintained, by, roger, bannister, who, in, 1954, was, the, first, to, run, the, long, elusive, four, minute, mile, and, jim, ryun, s, exploits, served, to, popularise, interval, training, races, between, british, rivals, sebastian, coe, steve, ovett, and, steve, cram, characterised, middle, distance, running, in, the, 1980s, from, the, 1990s, until, the, 2010s, north, africans, such, as, noureddine, morceli, of, algeria, and, hicham, el, guerrouj, of, morocco, came, to, dominate, the, 1500, and, mile, events, in, the, 2020s, western, european, athletes, have, returned, to, the, forefront, of, the, distance, with, athletes, such, as, jakob, ingebrigtsen, of, norway, jake, wightman, and, josh, kerr, both, british, milers, winning, global, titles, beyond, the, short, distances, of, sprinting, events, factors, such, as, an, athlete, s, reactions, and, top, speed, becomes, less, important, while, qualities, such, as, pace, tactics, and, endurance, become, more, so, there, are, three, common, long, distance, running, events, in, track, and, field, competitions, 3000, 5000, and, 10, 000, metres, the, latter, two, races, are, both, olympic, and, world, championship, events, outdoors, while, the, 3000, m, is, held, at, the, iaaf, world, indoor, championships, the, 5000, m, and, 10, 000, m, events, have, their, historical, roots, in, the, 3, mile, and, 6, mile, races, the, 3000, m, was, used, as, a, women, s, long, distance, event, entering, the, world, championship, programme, in, 1983, and, olympic, programme, in, 1984, but, this, was, abandoned, in, favour, of, a, women, s, 5000, m, event, in, 1995, marathons, while, long, distance, races, are, typically, run, on, street, courses, and, often, are, run, separately, from, other, track, and, field, events, in, terms, of, competition, rules, and, physical, demands, long, distance, track, races, have, much, in, common, with, middle, distance, races, except, that, pacing, stamina, and, tactics, become, much, greater, factors, in, performances, a, number, of, athletes, have, achieved, success, in, both, middle, and, long, distance, events, including, sa, d, aouita, who, set, world, records, from, 1500, m, to, 5000, m, the, use, of, pace, setters, in, long, distance, events, is, very, common, at, the, elite, level, although, they, are, not, present, at, championship, level, competitions, as, all, qualified, competitors, want, to, win, long, distance, track, events, gained, popularity, in, the, 1920s, by, the, achievements, of, the, flying, finns, such, as, multiple, olympic, champion, paavo, nurmi, the, successes, of, emil, z, topek, in, the, 1950s, promoted, intense, interval, training, methods, but, ron, clarke, s, record, breaking, feats, established, the, importance, of, natural, training, and, even, paced, running, the, 1990s, saw, the, rise, of, north, and, east, african, runners, in, long, distance, events, kenyans, and, ethiopians, in, particular, have, since, remained, dominant, in, these, events, relay, races, are, the, only, track, and, field, event, in, which, a, team, of, runners, directly, compete, against, other, teams, typically, a, team, is, made, up, of, four, runners, of, the, same, sex, each, runner, completes, their, specified, distance, referred, to, as, a, leg, before, handing, over, a, baton, to, a, teammate, who, then, begins, their, leg, there, is, usually, a, designated, area, where, athletes, must, exchange, the, baton, teams, may, be, disqualified, if, they, fail, to, complete, the, change, within, the, area, or, if, the, baton, is, dropped, during, the, race, a, team, may, also, be, disqualified, if, its, runners, are, deemed, to, have, wilfully, impeded, other, competitors, relay, races, emerged, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1880s, as, a, variation, on, charity, races, between, firemen, who, would, hand, a, red, pennant, on, to, teammates, every, 300, yards, two, very, common, relay, events, are, the, 4, 100, metres, relay, and, the, 4, 400, metres, relay, both, entered, the, olympic, programme, at, the, 1912, summer, games, after, a, one, off, men, s, medley, relay, featured, in, 1908, olympics, the, 4, 100, m, event, is, run, strictly, within, the, same, lane, on, the, track, meaning, that, the, team, collectively, runs, one, complete, circuit, of, the, track, teams, in, a, 4, 400, m, event, remain, in, their, own, lane, until, the, runner, of, the, second, leg, passes, the, first, bend, at, which, point, runners, can, leave, their, lanes, and, head, towards, the, inmost, part, of, the, circuit, for, the, second, and, third, baton, changeovers, teammates, must, align, themselves, in, respect, of, their, team, position, leading, teams, take, the, inner, lanes, while, members, of, slower, teams, must, await, the,

world, records, for, five, different, types, of, track, relays, as, with, 4, 100, m, and, 4, 400, m, events, all, races, comprise, teams, of, four, athletes, running, the, same, distances, with, the, less, commonly, contested, distances, being, the, 4, 200, m, 4, 800, m, and, 4, 1500, m, relays, other, events, include, the, distance, medley, relay, comprising, legs, of, 1200, 400, 800, and, 1600, metres, which, is, frequently, held, in, the, united, states, and, a, sprint, relay, known, as, the, swedish, medley, relay, which, is, popular, in, scandinavia, and, was, held, at, the, iaaf, world, youth, championships, in, athletics, programme, relay, events, have, significant, participation, in, the, united, states, where, a, number, of, large, meetings, or, relay, carnivals, are, focused, almost, solely, on, relay, events, races, with, hurdles, as, obstacles, were, first, popularised, in, the, 19th, century, in, england, the, first, known, event, held, in, 1830, was, a, variation, of, the, 100, yard, dash, that, included, heavy, wooden, barriers, as, obstacles, a, competition, between, the, oxford, and, cambridge, athletic, clubs, in, 1864, refined, this, holding, a, 120, yard,

finish, respectively, french, organisers, adapted, the, race, into, metric, adding, 28, cm, and, the, basics, of, this, race, the, men, s, 110, metres, hurdles, has, changed, little, the, origin, of, the, 400, metres, hurdles, also, lies, in, oxford, where, around, 1860, a, competition, was, held, over, 440, yards, and, twelve, 1, 06, m, high, wooden, barriers, were, placed, along, the, course, the, modern, regulations, stem, from, the, 1900, summer, olympics, the, distance, was, fixed, to, 400, m, while, ten, 3, foot, 91, 44, cm, hurdles, were, placed, 35, m, apart, on, the, track, with, the, first, and, final, hurdles, being, 45, m, and, 40, m, away, from, the, start, and, finish, respectively, women, s, hurdles, are, slightly, lower, at, 84, cm, 2, ft, 9, in, for, the, 100, m, event, and, 76, cm, 2, ft, 6, in, for, the, 400, m, event, the, most, common, events, are, the, 100, metres, hurdles, for, women, 110, m, hurdles, for, men, and, 400, m, hurdles, for, both, sexes, the, men, s, 110, m, has, been, featured, at, every, modern, summer, olympics, while, the, men, s, 400, m, was, introduced, in, the, second, edition, of, the, games, women, s, initially, competed, in, the, 80, metres, hurdles, event, which, entered, the, olympic, programme, in, 1932, this, was, extended, to, the, 100, m, hurdles, at, the, 1972, olympics, but, it, was, not, until, 1984, that, a, women, s, 400, m, hurdles, event, took, place, at, the, olympics, having, been, introduced, at, the, 1983, world, championships, in, athletics, the, previous, year, other, distances, and, heights, of, hurdles, such, as, the, 200, metres, hurdles, and, low, hurdles, were, once, common, but, are, now, held, infrequently, the, 300, metres, hurdles, is, run, in, some, levels, of, american, competition, outside, of, the, hurdles, events, the, steeplechase, race, is, the, other, track, and, field, event, with, obstacles, just, as, the, hurdling, events, the, steeplechase, finds, its, origin, in, student, competition, in, oxford, england, however, this, event, was, born, as, a, human, variation, on, the, original, steeplechase, competition, found, in, horse, racing, a, steeplechase, event, was, held, on, a, track, for, the, 1879, english, championships, and, the, 1900, summer, olympics, featured, men, s, 2500, m, and, 4000, m, steeplechase, races, the, event, was, held, over, various, distances, until, the, 1920, summer, olympics, marked, the, rise, of, the, 3000, metres, steeplechase, as, the, standard, event, the, iaaf, set, the, standards, of, the, event, in, 1954, and, the, event, is, held, on, a, 400, m, circuit, that, includes, a, water, jump, on, each, lap, despite, the, long, history, of, men, s, steeplechase, in, track, and, field, the, women, s, steeplechase, only, gained, world, championship, status, in, 2005, with, its, first, olympic, appearance, in, 2008, the, long, jump, is, one, of, the, oldest, track, and, field, events, having, its, roots, as, one, of, the, events, within, the, ancient, greek, pentathlon, contest, the, athletes, would, take, a, short, run, up, and, jump, into, an, area, of, dug, up, earth, with, the, winner, being, the, one, who, jumped, farthest, small, weights, halteres, were, held, in, each, hand, during, the, jump, then, swung, back, and, dropped, near, the, end, to, gain, extra, momentum, and, distance, the, modern, long, jump, standardised, in, england, and, the, united, states, around, 1860, bears, resemblance, to, the, ancient, event, although, no, weights, are, used, athletes, sprint, along, a, length, of, track, that, leads, to, a, jumping, board, and, a, sandpit, the, athletes, must, jump, before, a, marked, line, and, their, achieved, distance, is, measured, from, the, nearest, point, of, sand, disturbed, by, the, athlete, s, body, the, athletics, competition, at, the, first, olympics, featured, a, men, s, long, jump, competition, and, a, women, s, competition, was, introduced, at, the, 1948, summer, olympics, professional, long, jumpers, typically, have, strong, acceleration, and, sprinting, abilities, however, athletes, must, also, have, a, consistent, stride, to, allow, them, to, take, off, near, the, board, while, still, maintaining, their, maximum, speed, in, addition, to, the, traditional, long, jump, a, standing, long, jump, contest, exists, which, requires, that, athletes, leap, from, a, static, position, without, a, run, up, a, men, s, version, of, this, event, featured, on, the, olympic, programme, from, 1900, to, 1912, similar, to, the, long, jump, the, triple, jump, takes, place, on, a, track, heading, towards, a, sandpit, originally, athletes, would, hop, on, the, same, leg, twice, before, jumping, into, the, pit, but, this, was, changed, to, the, current, hop, step, and, jump, pattern, from, 1900, onwards, there, is, some, dispute, over, whether, the, triple, jump, was, contested, in, ancient, greece, while, some, historians, claim, that, a, contest, of, three, jumps, occurred, at, ancient, games, others, such, as, stephen, g, miller, believe, this, is, incorrect, suggesting, that, the, belief, stems, from, a, mythologised, account, of, phayllus, of, croton, having, jumped, 55, ancient, feet, around, 16, 3, m, the, book, of, leinster, a, 12th, century, irish, manuscript, records, the, existence, of, geal, ruith, triple, jump, contests, at, the, tailteann, games, the, men, s, triple, jump, competition, has, been, ever, present, at, the, modern, olympics, but, it, was, not, until, 1993, that, a, women, s, version, gained, world, championship, status, and, went, on, to, have, its, first, olympic, appearance, three, years, later, the, men, s, standing, triple, jump, event, featured, at, the, olympics, in, 1900, and, 1904, but, such, competitions, have, since, become, very, uncommon, although, it, is, still, used, as, a, non, competitive, exercise, drill, the, current, world, record, for, the, men, s, triple, jump, is, 18, 29, meter, 60, ft, 0in, held, by, jonathan, edwards, the, current, women, s, world, record, is, 15, 67, meters, 51, ft, 4, 3, 4in, held, by, yulimar, rojas, the, first, recorded, instances, of, high, jumping, competitions, were, in, scotland, in, the, 19th, century, further, competitions, were, organised, in, 1840, in, england, and, in, 1865, the, basic, rules, of, the, modern, event, were, standardised, there, athletes, have, a, short, run, up, and, then, take, off, from, one, foot, to, jump, over, a, horizontal, bar, and, fall, back, onto, a, cushioned, landing, area, the, men, s, high, jump, was, included, in, the, 1896, olympics, and, a, women, s, competition, followed, in, 1928, jumping, technique, has, played, a, significant, part, in, the, history, of, the, event, high, jumpers, typically, cleared, the, bar, feet, first, in, the, late, 19th, century, using, either, the, scissors, eastern, cut, off, or, western, roll, technique, the, straddle, technique, became, prominent, in, the, mid, 20th, century, but, dick, fosbury, overturned, tradition, by, pioneering, a, backwards, and, head, first, technique, in, the, late, 1960s, the, fosbury, flop, which, won, him, the, gold, at, the, 1968, olympics, this, technique, has, become, the, overwhelming, standard, for, the, sport, from, the, 1980s, onwards, the, standing, high, jump, was, contested, at, the, olympics, from, 1900, to, 1912, but, is, now, relatively, uncommon, outside, of, its, use, as, an, exercise, drill, in, terms, of, sport, the, use, of, poles, for, vaulting, distances, was, recorded, in, fierljeppen, contests, in, the, frisian, area, of, europe, and, vaulting, for, height, was, seen, at, gymnastics, competitions, in, germany, in, the, 1770s, one, of, the, earliest, recorded, pole, vault, competitions, was, in, cumbria, england, in, 1843, the, basic, rules, and, technique, of, the, event, originated, in, the, united, states, the, rules, required, that, athletes, do, not, move, their, hands, along, the, pole, and, athletes, began, clearing, the, bar, with, their, feet, first, and, twisting, so, that, the, stomach, faces, the, bar, bamboo, poles, were, introduced, in, the, 20th, century, and, a, metal, box, in, the, runway, for, planting, the, pole, became, standard, landing, mattresses, were, introduced, in, the, mid, 20th, century, to, protect, the, athletes, who, were, clearing, increasingly, greater, heights, the, modern, event, sees, athletes, run, down, a, strip, of, track, plant, the, pole, in, the, metal, box, and, vault, over, the, horizontal, bar, before, letting, go, of, the, pole, and, falling, backwards, onto, the, landing, mattress, while, earlier, versions, used, wooden, metal, or, bamboo, modern, poles, are, generally, made, from, artificial, materials, such, as, fibreglass, or, carbon, fibre, the, pole, vault, has, been, an, olympic, event, since, 1896, for, men, but, it, was, over, 100, years, later, that, the, first, women, s, world, championship, competition, was, held, at, the, 1997, iaaf, world, indoor, championships, the, first, women, s, olympic, pole, vaulting, competition, occurred, in, 2000, track, and, field, contains, some, of, the, foremost, kinds, of, throwing, sports, and, the, four, major, disciplines, are, the, only, pure, throwing, events, to, feature, at, the, olympic, games, the, genesis, of, the, shot, put, can, be, traced, to, pre, historic, competitions, with, rocks, in, the, middle, ages, the, stone, put, was, known, in, scotland, and, the, steinstossen, was, recorded, in, switzerland, in, the, 17th, century, cannonball, throwing, competitions, within, the, english, military, provided, a, precursor, to, the, modern, sport, the, term, shot, originates, from, the, use, of, round, shot, style, ammunition, for, the, sport, the, modern, rules, were, first, laid, out, in, 1860, and, required, that, competitors, take, legal, throws, within, a, square, throwing, area, of, seven, feet, 2, 13, m, on, each, side, this, was, amended, to, a, circle, area, with, a, seven, foot, diameter, in, 1906, and, the, weight, of, the, shot, was, standardised, to, 16, pounds, 7, 26, kg, throwing, technique, was, also, refined, over, this, period, with, bent, arm, throws, being, banned, as, they, were, deemed, too, dangerous, and, the, side, step, and, throw, technique, arising, in, the, united, states, in, 1876, the, shot, put, has, been, an, olympic, sport, for, men, since, 1896, and, a, women, s, competition, using, a, 4, kg, 8, 82, lb, shot, was, added, in, 1948, further, throwing, techniques, have, arisen, since, the, post, war, era, in, the, 1950s, parry, o, brien, popularised, the, 180, degree, turn, and, throw, technique, commonly, known, as, the, glide, breaking, the, world, record, 17, times, along, the, way, while, aleksandr, baryshnikov, and, brian, oldfield, introduced, the, spin, or, rotational, technique, in, 1976, in, the, discus, throw, athletes, compete, to, throw, a, heavy, disc, the, farthest, in, standard, competitions, athletes, throw, the, disc, from, a, set, circular, arc, and, take, turns, in, a, series, of, throw, with, the, singular, best, effort, deciding, the, victor, as, one, of, the, events, within, the, ancient, pentathlon, the, history, of, the, discus, throw, dates, back, to, 708, bc, in, ancient, times, a, heavy, circular, disc, was, thrown, from, a, set, standing, position, on, a, small, pedestal, and, it, was, this, style, that, was, revived, for, the, 1896, olympics, this, continued, until, the, 1906, intercalated, games, in, athens, which, featured, both, the, ancient, style, and, the, increasingly, popular, modern, style, of, turning, and, throwing, by, the, 1912, olympics, the, ancient, standing, throw, style, had, fallen, into, disuse, and, contests, starting, within, a, 2, 5, m, squared, throwing, area, became, the, standard, the, discus, implement, was, standardised, to, 2, kg, 4, 4, pounds, in, weight, and, 22, cm, 8, inches, in, diameter, in, 1907, the, women, s, discus, was, among, the, first, women, s, events, on, the, olympic, programme, being, introduced, in, 1928, the, first, modern, athlete, to, throw, the, discus, while, rotating, the, whole, body, was, czech, athlete, franti, ek, janda, suk, who, invented, the, technique, when, studying, the, position, of, the, famous, statue, of, discobolus, and, won, the, 1900, olympic, silver, medal, as, an, implement, of, war, and, hunting, the, javelin, throw, began, in, prehistoric, times, along, with, the, discus, the, javelin, was, the, second, throwing, event, in, the, ancient, olympic, pentathlon, records, from, 708, bc, show, two, javelin, competition, types, co, existing, throwing, at, a, target, and, throwing, the, javelin, for, distance, it, was, the, latter, type, from, which, the, modern, event, derives, in, ancient, competitions, athletes, would, wrap, an, ankyle, thin, leather, strip, around, the, javelin, that, acted, as, a, sling, to, facilitate, extra, distance, the, javelin, throw, gained, much, popularity, in, scandinavia, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, athletes, from, the, region, are, still, among, the, most, dominant, throwers, in, men, s, competitions, the, modern, event, features, a, short, run, up, on, a, track, and, then, the, thrower, releases, the, javelin, before, the, foul, line, the, runway, measures, at, a, minimum, of, 30m, in, length, and, is, covered, with, the, same, surface, as, the, track, the, first, olympic, men, s, javelin, throw, contest, was, held, in, 1908, and, a, women, s, competition, was, introduced, in, 1932, the, first, javelins, were, made, of, various, types, of, wood, but, in, the, 1950s, former, athlete, bud, held, introduced, a, hollow, javelin, then, a, metal, javelin, both, of, which, increased, throwers, performances, another, former, athlete, mikl, s, n, meth, invented, the, rough, tailed, javelin, and, throws, reached, in, excess, of, 100, m, edging, towards, the, limits, of, stadia, the, distances, and, the, increasing, number, of, horizontal, landings, led, the, iaaf, to, redesign, the, men, s, javelin, to, reduce, distance, and, increase, the, implement, s, downward, pitching, moment, to, allow, for, easier, measurement, rough, tailed, designs, were, banned, in, 1991, and, all, marks, achieved, with, such, javelins, were, removed, from, the, record, books, the, women, s, javelin, underwent, a, similar, redesign, in, 1999, the, current, javelin, specifications, are, 2, 6, to, 2, 7, m, in, length, and, 800, grams, in, weight, for, men, and, 2, 2, to, 2, 3, m, and, 600, g, for, women, the, earliest, recorded, precursors, to, the, modern, hammer, throw, stem, from, the, tailteann, games, of, ancient, ireland, which, featured, events, such, as, throwing, either, a, weight, attached, to, a, rope, a, large, rock, on, a, wooden, handle, or, even, a, chariot, wheel, on, a, wooden, axle, other, ancient, competitions, included, throwing, a, cast, iron, ball, attached, to, a, wooden, handle, the, root, of, the, term, hammer, throw, due, to, their, resemblance, to, the, tools, in, 16th, century, england, contests, involving, the, throwing, of, actual, blacksmith, s, sledgehammers, were, recorded, the, hammer, implement, was, standardised, in, 1887, and, the, competitions, began, to, resemble, the, modern, event, the, weight, of, the, metal, ball, was, set, at, 16, pounds, 7, 26, kg, while, the, attached, wire, had, to, measure, between, 1, 175, m, and, 1, 215, m, the, men, s, hammer, throw, became, an, olympic, event, in, 1900, but, the, women, s, event, using, a, 4, kg, 8, 82, lb, weight, was, not, widely, competed, until, much, later, finally, featuring, on, the, women, s, olympic, programme, in, 2000, the, distances, thrown, by, male, athletes, became, greater, from, the, 1950s, onwards, as, a, result, of, improved, equipment, using, the, denser, metals, a, switch, to, concrete, throwing, areas, and, more, advanced, training, techniques, professional, hammer, throwers, were, historically, large, strong, sturdy, athletes, however, qualities, such, as, refined, technique, speed, and, flexibility, have, become, increasingly, important, in, the, modern, era, as, the, legal, throwing, area, has, been, reduced, from, 90, to, 34, 92, degrees, and, throwing, technique, involves, three, to, four, controlled, rotations, combined, or, multi, discipline, events, are, competitions, in, which, athletes, participate, in, a, number, of, track, and, field, events, earning, points, for, their, performance, in, each, event, which, adds, to, a, total, points, score, outdoors, the, most, common, combined, events, are, the, men, s, decathlon, ten, events, and, the, women, s, heptathlon, seven, events, due, to, stadium, limitations, indoor, combined, events, competition, have, a, reduced, number, of, events, resulting, in, the, men, s, heptathlon, and, the, women, s, pentathlon, athletes, are, allocated, points, based, on, an, international, standard, points, scoring, system, such, as, the, decathlon, scoring, table, the, ancient, olympic, pentathlon, comprising, long, jump, javelin, discus, the, stadion, race, and, wrestling, was, a, precursor, to, the, track, and, field, combined, events, and, this, ancient, event, was, restored, at, the, 1906, summer, olympics, intercalated, games, a, men, s, all, around, was, held, at, the, 1904, summer, olympics, contested, between, five, american, and, two, british, athletes, the, term, track, and, field, is, intertwined, with, the, stadiums, that, first, hosted, such, competitions, the, two, basic, features, of, a, track, and, field, stadium, are, the, outer, oval, shaped, running, track, and, an, area, of, turf, within, this, track, the, field, in, earlier, competitions, track, lengths, varied, the, panathinaiko, stadium, measured, 333, 33, metres, at, the, 1896, summer, olympics, while, at, the, 1904, olympics, the, distance, was, a, third, of, a, mile, 536, 45, m, at, francis, field, as, the, sport, developed, the, iaaf, standardised, the, length, to, 400, m, and, stated, that, the, tracks, must, be, split, into, six, to, eight, running, lanes, precise, widths, for, the, lanes, were, established, as, were, regulations, regarding, the, curvature, of, the, track, tracks, made, of, flattened, cinders, were, popular, in, the, early, 20th, century, but, synthetic, tracks, became, standard, in, the, late, 1960s, 3m, s, tartan, track, an, all, weather, running, track, of, polyurethane, gained, popularity, after, its, use, at, the, 1968, us, olympic, trials, and, the, 1968, summer, olympics, and, it, began, the, process, in, which, synthetic, tracks, became, the, standard, for, the, sport, many, track, and, field, stadiums, are, multi, purpose, stadiums, with, the, running, track, surrounding, a, field, built, for, other, sports, such, as, the, various, types, of, football, the, field, of, the, stadium, combines, a, number, of, elements, for, use, in, the, jumping, and, throwing, events, the, long, jump, and, triple, jump, areas, comprise, a, straight, narrow, 40, metre, running, track, with, a, sandpit, at, one, or, both, ends, jumps, are, measured, from, a, take, off, board, typically, a, small, strip, of, wood, with, a, plasticine, marker, attached, which, ensures, athletes, jump, from, behind, the, measurement, line, the, pole, vault, area, is, also, a, 40, metre, running, track, and, has, an, indentation, in, the, ground, the, box, where, vaulters, plant, their, poles, to, propel, themselves, over, a, crossbar, before, falling, onto, cushioned, landing, mats, the, high, jump, is, a, stripped, down, version, of, this, with, an, open, area, of, track, or, field, that, leads, to, a, crossbar, with, a, square, area, of, landing, mats, behind, it, the, four, throwing, events, generally, all, begin, on, one, side, of, the, stadium, the, javelin, throw, typically, takes, place, on, a, piece, of, track, that, is, central, and, parallel, to, the, straights, of, the, main, running, track, the, javelin, throwing, area, is, a, sector, shape, frequently, across, the, pitch, sports, field, in, the, middle, of, the, stadium, ensuring, that, the, javelin, has, a, minimal, chance, of, causing, damage, or, injury, the, discus, throw, and, hammer, throw, contests, begin, in, a, tall, metal, cage, usually, situated, in, one, of, the, corners, of, the, field, the, cage, reduces, the, danger, of, implements, being, thrown, out, of, the, field, of, play, and, throws, travel, diagonally, across, the, field, in, the, centre, of, the, stadium, the, shot, put, features, a, circular, throwing, area, with, a, toe, board, at, one, end, the, throwing, area, is, a, sector, some, stadia, also, have, a, water, jump, area, on, one, side, of, the, field, specifically, for, steeplechase, races, basic, indoor, venues, may, be, adapted, gymnasiums, which, can, easily, accommodate, high, jump, competitions, and, short, track, events, full, size, indoor, arenas, i, e, those, fully, equipped, to, host, all, events, for, the, world, indoor, championships, bear, similarities, with, their, outdoor, equivalents, typically, a, central, area, is, surrounded, by, a, 200, metre, oval, track, with, four, to, eight, lanes, the, track, can, be, banked, at, the, turns, to, allow, athletes, to, run, around, the, radius, more, comfortably, some, have, a, second, running, track, going, straight, across, the, field, area, parallel, to, the, straights, of, the, main, circuit, this, track, is, used, for, the, 60, metres, and, 60, metres, hurdles, events, which, are, held, almost, exclusively, indoors, another, common, adaptation, in, the, united, states, is, a, 160, yard, track, 11, laps, to, a, mile, 148m, that, fits, into, a, common, basketball, court, sized, arena, this, was, quite, popular, when, races, were, held, at, imperial, distances, which, gradually, was, phased, out, by, different, organizations, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, examples, of, this, configuration, include, the, millrose, games, at, madison, square, garden, and, the, sunkist, invitational, formerly, held, in, the, los, angeles, sports, arena, all, four, of, the, common, jumping, events, are, held, at, indoor, venues, the, long, and, triple, jump, areas, run, alongside, the, central, 60, m, track, and, are, mostly, identical, in, form, to, their, outdoor, counterparts, the, pole, vault, track, and, landing, area, are, also, alongside, the, central, running, track, shot, put, and, weight, throw, are, the, only, throwing, events, held, indoors, due, to, size, restrictions, the, throwing, area, is, similar, to, the, outdoor, event, but, the, landing, sector, is, a, rectangular, section, surrounded, by, netting, or, a, stop, barrier, in, addition, to, hosting, the, world, indoor, championships, the, iaaf, has, hosted, the, iaaf, world, indoor, tour, since,

lanes, the, start, line, must, be, curved, so, that, all, the, athletes, start, the, same, distance, from, the, finish, starting, blocks, may, be, used, for, all, races, up, to, and, including, 400, m, including, the, first, leg, of, the, 4, 100, m, and, 4, 400, m, and, may, not, be, used, for, any, other, race, no, part, of, the, starting, block, may, overlap, the, start, line, or, extend, into, another, lane, all, races, must, be, started, by, the, report, of, the, starter, s, gun, or, approved, starting, apparatus, fired, upwards, after, they, have, ascertained, that, athletes, are, steady, and, in, the, correct, starting, position, an, athlete, may, not, touch, either, the, start, line, or, the, ground, in, front, of, it, with, their, hands, or, feet, when, on, their, marks, for, sprint, races, up, to, 400, m, the, starter, gives, two, commands, on, your, marks, to, instruct, athletes, to, approach, the, start, line, followed, by, set, to, advise, the, athletes, that, the, start, of, the, race, is, imminent, the, commands, of, the, starter, are, typically, given, in, the, native, language, in, national, competitions, or, in, english, or, french, in, international, competitions, once, all, athletes, are, set, in, their, starting, position, the, gun, or, an, approved, starting, apparatus, must, be, fired, or, activated, if, the, starter, is, not, satisfied, that, all, are, ready, to, proceed, the, athletes, may, be, called, out, of, the, blocks, and, the, process, started, over, there, are, different, types, of, starts, for, races, of, different, distances, middle, and, long, distance, races, mainly, use, the, waterfall, start, this, is, when, all, athletes, begin, on, a, curved, line, that, moves, farther, out, at, the, outer, edge, of, the, track, competitors, are, allowed, to, move, towards, the, inside, lane, right, away, as, long, as, it, is, safe, to, do, so, for, some, middle, distance, races, such, as, 800, m, each, athlete, starts, in, their, own, lane, once, the, gun, fires, they, must, run, in, the, lane, they, began, in, until, they, reach, a, set, of, cones, on, the, track, that, signal, that, they, can, cut, in, and, move, towards, the, inside, lane, for, sprint, races, athletes, begin, in, start, blocks, and, must, stay, in, their, own, lane, for, the, entire, race, an, athlete, after, assuming, a, final, set, position, may, not, commence, his, starting, motion, until, after, receiving, the, report, of, the, gun, or, approved, starting, apparatus, if, in, the, judgment, of, the, starter, or, recallers, he, does, so, any, earlier, it, is, considered, a, false, start, it, is, deemed, a, false, start, if, in, the, judgment, of, the, starter, an, athlete, fails, to, comply, with, the, commands, on, your, marks, or, set, as, appropriate, after, a, reasonable, time, or, an, athlete, after, the, command, on, your, marks, disturbs, other, athletes, in, the, race, through, sound, or, otherwise, if, the, runner, is, in, the, set, position, and, moves, then, the, runner, is, also, disqualified, as, of, 2010, any, athlete, making, a, false, start, is, disqualified, in, international, elite, competition, electronically, tethered, starting, blocks, sense, the, reaction, time, of, the, athletes, if, the, athlete, reacts, in, less, than, 0, 1, second, an, alert, sounds, for, a, recall, starter, and, the, offending, athlete, is, guilty, of, a, false, start, since, 2009, the, offending, athletes, are, immediately, disqualified, for, sprinting, events, except, the, 4, 400, m, relay, and, the, indoor, 400, metres, each, athlete, must, run, the, race, within, their, allocated, lane, from, start, to, finish, if, an, athlete, leaves, their, lane, or, steps, on, the, line, demarking, each, lane, the, athlete, will, be, disqualified, lane, rules, also, apply, for, initial, periods, of, other, track, races, for, example, the, beginning, of, the, 800, m, similar, rules, apply, for, longer, distance, races, when, a, large, field, of, athletes, is, present, and, separate, starting, points, are, designated, with, the, field, merging, into, one, group, shortly, after, the, starting, phase, any, athlete, who, jostles, or, obstructs, another, athlete, in, a, way, that, impedes, his, progress, should, be, disqualified, from, that, event, however, if, an, athlete, is, pushed, or, forced, by, another, person, to, run, outside, his, lane, and, if, no, material, advantage, is, gained, the, athlete, should, not, be, disqualified, the, finish, of, a, race, is, marked, by, a, white, line, 5, cm, wide, the, finishing, position, of, athletes, is, determined, by, the, order, in, which, any, part, of, their, torso, as, distinguished, from, the, head, neck, arms, legs, hands, or, feet, reaches, the, vertical, plane, of, the, nearer, edge, of, the, finish, line, fully, automatic, timing, systems, photo, timing, are, becoming, more, and, more, common, at, increasingly, lower, levels, of, track, meets, improving, the, accuracy, while, eliminating, the, need, for, eagle, eyed, officials, on, the, finish, line, fully, automatic, timing, fat, is, required, for, high, level, meets, and, any, time, a, sprint, record, is, set, though, distance, records, can, be, accepted, if, timed, by, three, independent, stopwatches, with, the, accuracy, of, the, timing, systems, ties, are, rare, ties, between, different, athletes, are, resolved, as, follows, in, determining, whether, there, has, been, a, tie, in, any, round, for, a, qualifying, position, for, the, next, round, based, on, time, a, judge, called, the, chief, photo, finish, judge, must, consider, the, actual, time, recorded, by, the, athletes, to, one, thousandth, of, a, second, if, the, judge, decides, that, there, has, been, a, tie, the, tying, athletes, must, be, placed, in, the, next, round, or, if, that, is, not, practicable, lots, must, be, drawn, to, determine, who, must, be, placed, in, the, next, round, in, the, case, of, a, tie, for, first, place, in, any, final, the, referee, decides, whether, it, is, practicable, to, arrange, for, the, athletes, so, tying, to, compete, again, if, he, decides, it, is, not, the, result, stands, ties, in, other, placings, remain, in, general, most, field, events, allow, a, competitor, to, take, their, attempt, individually, under, theoretically, the, same, conditions, as, the, other, competitors, in, the, competition, each, attempt, is, measured, to, determine, who, achieved, the, greatest, distance, vertical, jumps, high, jump, and, pole, vault, set, a, bar, at, a, particular, height, the, competitor, must, clear, the, bar, without, knocking, it, off, the, standards, that, are, holding, the, bar, flat, three, failures, in, a, row, ends, the, competitor, s, participation, in, the, event, the, competitor, has, the, option, to, pass, their, attempt, which, can, be, used, to, strategic, advantage, of, course, that, advantage, is, lost, if, the, competitor, misses, a, pass, could, be, used, to, save, energy, and, avoid, taking, a, jump, that, would, not, improve, their, position, in, the, standings, after, all, competitors, have, either, cleared, passed, or, failed, their, attempts, at, a, height, the, bar, goes, up, the, amount, the, bar, goes, up, is, predetermined, before, the, competition, though, when, one, competitor, remains, that, competitor, may, choose, their, own, heights, for, the, remaining, attempts, a, record, is, kept, of, each, attempt, by, each, competitor, after, all, competitors, have, taken, their, attempts, the, one, jumping, the, highest, is, the, winner, and, so, on, down, the, other, competitors, in, the, event, ties, are, broken, by, first, the, number, of, attempts, taken, at, the, highest, height, fewest, wins, and, then, if, still, tied, by, the, total, number, of, misses, in, the, competition, as, a, whole, the, bar, does, not, go, back, to, a, lower, height, except, to, break, a, tie, for, first, place, or, a, qualifying, position, if, those, critical, positions, are, still, tied, after, applying, the, tiebreakers, all, tied, competitors, take, a, fourth, jump, at, the, last, height, if, they, still, miss, the, bar, goes, down, one, increment, where, they, again, jump, this, process, continues, until, the, tie, is, broken, horizontal, jumps, long, jump, and, triple, jump, and, all, throws, must, be, initiated, behind, a, line, in, the, case, of, horizontal, jumps, that, line, is, a, straight, line, perpendicular, to, the, runway, in, the, case, of, throws, that, line, is, an, arc, or, a, circle, crossing, the, line, while, initiating, the, attempt, invalidates, the, attempt, it, becomes, a, foul, all, landings, must, occur, in, a, sector, for, the, jumps, that, is, a, sand, filled, pit, for, throws, it, is, a, defined, sector, a, throw, landing, on, the, line, on, the, edge, of, sector, is, a, foul, the, inside, edge, of, the, line, is, the, outside, edge, of, the, sector, assuming, a, proper, attempt, officials, measure, the, distance, from, the, closest, landing, point, back, to, the, line, the, measuring, tape, is, carefully, straightened, to, the, shortest, distance, between, the, point, and, the, line, to, accomplish, this, the, tape, must, be, perfectly, perpendicular, to, the, take, off, line, in, jumps, or, is, pulled, through, the, center, point, of, the, arc, for, throws, the, officials, at, the, landing, end, of, the, tape, have, the, zero, while, the, officials, at, the, point, of, initiation, measure, and, record, the, length, whenever, a, record, or, potential, record, occurs, that, measurement, is, taken, again, with, a, steel, tape, and, observed, by, at, least, three, officials, plus, usually, the, meet, referee, steel, tapes, are, easily, bent, and, damaged, so, are, not, used, to, measure, everyday, competitions, for, major, competitions, each, competitor, gets, three, tries, the, top, competitors, usually, 8, or, 9, depending, on, that, competition, s, rules, or, the, number, of, lanes, on, the, track, gets, three, more, tries, at, that, level, of, competition, the, order, of, competitors, for, those, final, three, attempts, are, set, so, the, competitor, in, first, place, at, the, end, of, the, third, round, is, last, while, the, last, competitor, to, qualify, goes, first, some, meets, rearrange, the, competition, order, again, for, the, final, round, so, the, final, attempt, is, taken, by, the, leader, at, that, point, at, other, competitions, meet, management, may, choose, to, limit, all, competitors, to, four, or, three, attempts, whatever, the, format, all, competitors, get, an, equal, number, of, attempts, track, and, field, athletes, wear, special, shoes, with, spikes, known, as, track, spikes, or, simply, spikes, men, and, women, have, different, weights, for, their, throwing, implements, men, s, javelin, is, 800, grams, compared, to, 600, for, women, men, s, weight, throw,

athletics, organisations, world, athletics, is, the, global, governing, body, for, track, and, field, and, athletics, as, a, whole, the, governance, of, track, and, field, at, continental, and, national, level, is, also, done, by, athletics, bodies, some, national, federations, are, named, after, the, sport, including, usa, track, field, and, the, philippine, amateur, track, field, association, but, these, organisations, govern, more, than, just, track, and, field, and, are, in, fact, athletics, governing, bodies, these, national, federations, regulate, sub, national, and, local, track, and, field, clubs, as, well, as, other, types, of, running, clubs, the, major, global, track, and, field, competitions, are, both, held, under, the, scope, of, athletics, track, and, field, contests, make, up, the, majority, of, events, on, the, olympic, and, paralympic, athletics, programmes, which, occur, every, four, years, track, and, field, events, have, held, a, prominent, position, at, the, summer, olympics, since, its, inception, in, 1896, and, the, events, are, typically, held, in, the, main, stadium, of, the, olympic, and, paralympic, games, events, such, as, the, 100, metres, receive, some, of, the, highest, levels, of, media, coverage, of, any, olympic, or, paralympic, sporting, event, the, other, two, major, international, competition, for, track, and, field, are, organised, by, the, iaaf, the, iaaf, had, selected, the, olympic, competition, as, its, world, championship, event, in, 1913, but, a, separate, world, championships, for, athletics, alone, was, first, held, in, 1983, the, iaaf, world, championships, in, athletics, the, championships, comprised, track, and, field, competitions, plus, the, marathon, and, racewalking, competitions, initially, this, worked, on, a, quadrennial, basis, but, after, 1991, it, changed, to, a, biennial, format, in, terms, of, indoor, track, and, field, the, iaaf, world, indoor, championships, has, been, held, every, two, years, since, 1985, and, this, is, the, only, world, championships, that, consists, of, solely, track, and, field, events, similar, to, the, event, programmes, at, the, olympics, paralympics, and, world, championships, track, and, field, forms, a, significant, part, of, continental, championships, the, south, american, championships, in, athletics, created, in, 1919, was, the, first, continental, championships, and, the, european, athletics, championships, became, the, second, championships, of, this, type, in, 1934, the, asian, athletics, championships, and, african, championships, in, athletics, were, created, in, the, 1970s, and, oceania, started, its, championships, in, 1990, there, are, also, indoor, continental, competitions, in, europe, european, athletics, indoor, championships, and, asia, asian, indoor, athletics, championships, there, has, not, been, a, consistent, championships, for, all, of, north, america, which, may, be, in, part, due, to, the, success, of, both, the, central, american, and, caribbean, championships, and, the, usa, outdoor, track, and, field, championships, most, countries, have, a, national, championship, in, track, and, field, and, for, athletes, these, often, play, a, role, in, gaining, selection, into, major, competitions, some, countries, hold, many, track, and, field, championships, at, high, school, and, college, level, which, help, develop, younger, athletes, some, of, these, have, gained, significant, exposure, and, prestige, such, as, the, ncaa, track, and, field, championship, in, the, united, states, and, the, jamaican, high, school, championships, however, the, number, and, status, of, such, competitions, significantly, vary, from, country, to, country, mirroring, the, role, that, track, and, field, events, have, at, the, summer, olympics, and, paralympics, the, sport, is, featured, within, the, athletics, programmes, of, many, major, multi, sport, events, among, some, of, the, first, of, these, events, to, follow, the, olympic, style, model, were, the, world, university, games, in, 1923, the, commonwealth, games, in, 1930, and, the, maccabiah, games, in, 1932, the, number, of, major, multi, sport, events, greatly, increased, during, the, 20th, century, and, thus, did, the, number, of, track, and, field, events, held, within, them, typically, track, and, field, events, are, hosted, at, the, main, stadium, of, the, games, after, the, olympic, and, paralympic, games, the, most, prominent, events, for, track, and, field, athletes, include, the, three, ioc, sanctioned, continental, games, the, all, africa, games, asian, games, and, the, pan, american, games, other, games, such, as, the, commonwealth, games, and, summer, universiade, and, world, masters, games, have, significant, participation, from, track, and, field, athletes, track, and, field, is, also, present, at, the, national, games, level, with, competitions, such, as, the, chinese, national, games, serving, as, the, most, prestigious, national, competition, for, domestic, track, and, field, athletes, one, day, track, and, field, meetings, form, the, most, common, and, seasonal, aspect, of, the, sport, they, are, the, most, basic, level, of, track, and, field, competition, meetings, are, generally, organised, annually, either, under, the, patronage, of, an, educational, institution, or, sports, club, or, by, a, group, or, business, that, serves, as, the, meeting, promoter, in, the, case, of, the, former, athletes, are, selected, to, represent, their, club, or, institution, in, the, case, of, privately, run, or, independent, meetings, athletes, participate, on, an, invitation, only, basis, the, most, basic, type, of, meetings, are, all, comers, track, meets, which, are, largely, small, local, informal, competitions, that, allow, people, of, all, ages, and, abilities, to, compete, as, meetings, become, more, organized, they, can, gain, official, sanctioning, by, the, local, or, national, association, for, the, sport, at, the, professional, level, meetings, began, to, offer, significant, financial, incentives, for, all, athletes, in, the, 1990s, in, europe, with, the, creation, of, the, golden, four, competition, comprising, meetings, in, z, rich, brussels, berlin, and, oslo, this, expanded, and, received, iaaf, backing, as, the, iaaf, golden, league, in, 1998, which, was, later, supplemented, by, the, branding, of, selected, meetings, worldwide, as, the, iaaf, world, athletics, tour, in, 2010, the, golden, league, idea, was, expanded, globally, as, the, diamond, league, series, and, this, now, forms, the, top, tier, of, professional, one, day, track, and, field, meetings, the, iaaf, world, rankings, system, was, introduced, for, the, 2018, season, an, athlete, s, position, within, the, ranking, will, be, determined, by, points, scored, based, on, their, performance, and, importance, of, the, competition, the, points, will, be, considered, for, eligibility, for, the, world, athletics, championships, and, olympic, games, this, system, will, affect, athlete, participation, which, has, typically, been, determined, by, national, bodies, either, through, selection, panels, or, national, trials, events, athletes, performances, are, timed, or, measured, at, virtually, all, track, and, field, competitions, doing, so, can, not, only, serve, as, a, way, of, determining, the, winner, in, an, event, but, it, can, also, be, used, for, historical, comparison, i, e, a, record, a, large, variety, of, record, types, exist, and, men, s, and, women, s, performances, are, recorded, separately, the, foremost, types, of, records, organise, athlete, s, performances, by, the, region, they, represent, beginning, with, national, records, then, continental, records, up, to, the, global, or, world, record, level, national, governing, bodies, control, the, national, record, lists, the, area, associations, organise, their, respective, continental, lists, and, the, iaaf, ratifies, world, records, the, iaaf, ratifies, track, and, field, world, records, if, they, meet, their, set, criteria, the, iaaf, first, published, a, world, records, list, in, 1914, initially, for, men, s, events, only, there, were, 53, recognised, records, in, running, hurdling, and, relay, and, 12, field, records, world, records, in, women, s, events, began, in, 1936, as, more, events, were, gradually, added, to, the, list, but, significant, changes, were, made, in, the, late, 1970s, first, all, records, in, imperial, measurements, were, abandoned, in, 1976, with, the, sole, exceptional, being, the, mile, run, due, to, the, prestige, and, history, of, the, event, the, following, year, all, world, records, in, sprint, events, would, only, be, recognised, if, fully, automatic, electronic, timing, was, used, as, opposed, to, the, traditional, hand, timing, stopwatch, method, in, 1981, electronic, timing, was, made, compulsory, for, all, world, record, runs, in, track, and, field, with, times, being, recorded, to, within, one, hundredth, of, a, second, two, additional, types, of, world, record, were, introduced, in, 1987, world, records, for, indoor, competitions, and, world, records, for, junior, athletes, under, 20, years, old, the, next, most, important, record, type, are, those, achieved, at, a, specific, competition, for, example, the, olympic, records, represent, the, best, performances, by, athletes, at, the, summer, olympics, all, major, championships, and, games, have, their, relevant, competition, records, and, a, large, number, of, track, and, field, meetings, keep, a, note, of, their, meet, records, other, record, types, include, stadium, records, records, by, age, range, records, by, disability, and, records, by, institution, or, organisation, cash, bonuses, are, usually, offered, to, athletes, if, they, break, significant, records, as, doing, so, can, generate, greater, interest, and, public, attendance, in, track, and, field, competitions, track, and, field, athletes, are, banned, from, ingesting, or, using, certain, substances, by, governing, bodies, for, the, sport, from, the, national, to, the, international, level, the, iaaf, s, constitution, incorporates, the, world, anti, doping, code, among, other, anti, doping, measures, practices, such, as, blood, doping, and, the, use, of, anabolic, steroids, peptide, hormones, stimulants, or, diuretics, can, give, athletes, a, physical, competitive, advantage, in, track, and, field, the, use, of, such, substances, in, track, and, field, is, opposed, on, both, ethical, and, medical, grounds, given, that, the, sport, functions, by, measuring, and, comparing, athletes, performances, performance, enhancing, substances, create, an,
