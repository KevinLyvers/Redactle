a, stove, or, range, is, a, device, that, generates, heat, inside, or, on, top, of, the, device, for, local, heating, or, cooking, stoves, can, be, powered, with, many, fuels, such, as, electricity, natural, gas, gasoline, wood, and, coal, due, to, concerns, about, air, pollution, efforts, have, been, made, to, improve, stove, design, pellet, stoves, are, a, type, of, clean, burning, stove, air, tight, stoves, are, another, type, that, burn, the, wood, more, completely, and, therefore, reduce, the, amount, of, the, combustion, by, products, another, method, of, reducing, air, pollution, is, through, the, addition, of, a, device, to, clean, the, exhaust, gas, for, example, a, filter, or, afterburner, research, and, development, on, safer, and, less, emission, releasing, stoves, is, continuously, evolving, the, term, stove, is, derived, from, the, old, english, word, stofa, indicating, any, individual, enclosed, space, or, room, stove, may, sometimes, still, be, used, in, this, sense, until, well, into, the, 19th, century, stove, was, defined, as, a, single, heated, room, cooking, was, performed, over, an, open, fire, since, nearly, two, million, years, ago, it, is, uncertain, how, fires, were, started, at, these, times, some, hypotheses, include, the, removal, of, burning, branches, from, wildfires, spark, generation, through, hitting, rocks, or, accidental, lighting, through, the, chipping, of, stone, tools, during, the, paleolithic, era, approximately, 200, 000, to, 40, 000, years, ago, primitive, hearths, were, constructed, with, stones, arranged, in, a, circle, shape, human, homes, centered, around, these, hearths, for, warmth, and, food, open, fires, were, quite, effective, most, fires, are, 30, efficient, on, average, and, heat, is, distributed, positively, with, no, heat, being, lost, into, the, body, of, a, stove, an, estimated, three, million, people, still, cook, their, food, today, over, open, fires, pottery, and, other, cooking, vessels, were, later, placed, on, open, fire, eventually, setting, the, vessel, on, a, support, such, as, a, base, of, three, stones, resulted, in, a, stove, the, three, stone, stove, is, still, widely, used, around, the, world, in, some, areas, it, developed, into, a, u, shaped, dried, mud, or, brick, enclosure, with, the, opening, in, the, front, for, fuel, and, air, sometimes, with, a, second, smaller, hole, at, the, rear, the, earliest, recorded, stove, was, created, in, alsace, france, in, 1490, it, was, entirely, made, out, of, brick, and, tile, including, the, flue, pipe, in, similar, times, the, ancient, egyptian, jewish, and, roman, people, used, stone, and, brick, ovens, fueled, with, wood, in, order, to, make, bread, and, other, culinary, staples, these, designs, did, not, differ, extremely, from, modern, day, pizza, ovens, later, scandinavian, stoves, featured, a, long, hollow, iron, chimney, with, iron, baffles, constructed, to, extend, the, passage, of, the, leaving, gases, and, extract, maximum, heat, russian, versions, are, still, frequently, used, today, in, northern, nations, as, they, hold, six, thick, walled, stone, flues, this, design, is, frequently, positioned, at, the, intersection, of, internal, partition, walls, with, a, piece, of, the, stove, and, flue, inside, each, of, four, rooms, a, fire, is, kept, until, the, stove, and, flues, are, hot, at, which, point, the, fire, is, extinguished, and, the, flues, are, closed, storing, the, heat, during, colonial, america, beehive, shaped, brick, ovens, were, used, to, bake, cakes, and, other, pastries, temperature, control, was, closely, managed, by, burning, the, appropriate, quantity, of, wood, to, ash, and, then, testing, by, inserting, hands, inside, adding, additional, wood, or, opening, the, door, to, allow, cooling, in, 1642, at, lynn, massachusetts, the, first, cast, iron, stove, was, constructed, this, stove, was, little, more, than, a, cast, iron, box, with, no, grates, in, 1735, the, castrol, stove, or, stew, stove, was, developed, by, french, designer, francois, cuvilli, s, it, was, the, earliest, recorded, wood, burning, stove, benjamin, franklin, designed, the, pennsylvania, fireplace, in, 1740, which, incorporated, the, fundamental, concepts, of, the, heating, stove, the, franklin, stove, used, a, grate, to, burn, wood, and, had, sliding, doors, to, control, the, draught, or, flow, of, air, through, it, because, of, its, compact, size, the, stove, could, be, housed, in, a, large, fireplace, or, used, free, standing, in, the, middle, of, a, room, by, connecting, it, to, a, chimney, developed, amid, a, wood, shortage, it, required, one, quarter, the, quantity, of, fuel, as, a, regular, fireplace, and, could, raise, the, room, temperature, more, quickly, throughout, north, america, the, franklin, stove, enjoyed, widespread, adoption, warming, farmhouses, city, residences, and, frontier, huts, in, 1795, count, rumford, created, a, particularly, popular, version, featuring, a, single, fire, source, but, allowing, for, the, temperature, to, be, adjusted, independently, for, numerous, pots, at, once, all, while, heating, the, space, its, main, disadvantage, was, that, it, was, too, large, for, most, residential, kitchens, isaac, orr, of, philadelphia, pennsylvania, created, the, first, circular, cast, iron, stoves, with, grates, for, cooking, meals, on, them, roughly, five, years, later, the, potbellied, stove, traces, its, origins, to, the, early, 1800s, inspired, by, the, franklin, stove, developed, twenty, years, prior, jordan, a, mott, designed, the, base, burning, stove, for, burning, anthracite, coal, in, 1833, in, 1834, philo, stewart, created, the, oberlin, stove, a, small, wood, burning, cast, iron, stove, it, was, a, compact, metal, kitchen, stove, that, was, far, more, efficient, than, cooking, in, a, fireplace, due, to, its, improved, heating, capacity, and, allowance, for, record, cooking, durations, it, was, a, major, commercial, success, because, it, could, be, formed, into, desired, shapes, and, forms, and, could, survive, temperature, fluctuations, from, hot, to, cold, readily, these, iron, stoves, evolved, into, specialized, cooking, machines, with, chimney, flue, pipes, oven, openings, and, water, heating, systems, the, earliest, reported, use, of, gas, for, cooking, according, to, the, gas, museum, in, leicester, england, was, by, a, moravian, called, zachaus, winzler, in, 1802, the, switch, to, gas, was, prompted, by, concerns, about, air, pollution, deforestation, and, climate, change, causing, the, general, public, to, reconsider, the, usage, of, coal, and, wood, stoves, under, common, use, conditions, indoor, no2, from, gas, stoves, can, quickly, exceed, us, environmental, protection, agency, epa, and, world, health, organization, who, 1, h, exposure, benchmarks, in, kitchen, air, no2, pollution, has, been, shown, to, harm, human, health, the, first, commercially, produced, gas, stove, invented, by, englishman, james, sharp, did, not, enter, the, market, for, another, three, decades, by, the, end, of, the, century, the, stoves, became, popular, because, they, were, easier, to, control, and, required, less, maintenance, than, wood, or, coal, stoves, electric, stoves, became, popular, not, long, after, the, advent, of, home, electricity, one, early, model, was, created, by, thomas, ahearn, the, owner, of, a, canadian, electric, company, whose, marketing, included, a, demonstration, meal, prepared, entirely, with, electricity, at, ottawa, s, windsor, hotel, in, 1892, as, central, heating, became, the, standard, in, the, developed, world, cooking, transitioned, to, the, primary, function, of, stoves, in, the, twentieth, century, iron, cooking, stoves, that, used, wood, charcoal, or, coal, tended, to, radiate, much, heat, which, made, the, kitchen, unbearably, hot, in, the, summer, they, were, superseded, in, the, twentieth, century, by, steel, ranges, or, ovens, fueled, by, natural, gas, or, electricity, the, first, patents, for, induction, stoves, date, from, the, early, 1900s, demonstration, stoves, were, shown, by, the, frigidaire, division, of, general, motors, in, the, mid, 1950s, on, a, touring, gm, showcase, in, north, america, the, induction, cooker, was, shown, heating, a, pot, of, water, with, a, newspaper, placed, between, the, stove, and, the, pot, to, demonstrate, the, convenience, and, safety, this, unit, however, was, never, put, into, production, modern, implementation, in, the, us, dates, from, the, early, 1970s, with, work, done, at, the, research, development, center, of, westinghouse, electric, corporation, at, churchill, borough, near, pittsburgh, that, work, was, first, put, on, public, display, at, the, 1971, national, association, of, home, builders, convention, in, houston, texas, as, part, of, the, westinghouse, consumer, products, division, display, the, stand, alone, single, burner, range, was, named, the, cool, top, induction, range, it, used, paralleled, delco, electronics, transistors, developed, for, automotive, electronic, ignition, systems, to, drive, the, 25, khz, current, westinghouse, decided, to, make, a, few, hundred, production, units, to, develop, the, market, those, were, named, cool, top, 2, ct2, induction, ranges, the, development, work, was, done, at, the, same, r, d, location, by, a, team, led, by, bill, moreland, and, terry, malarkey, the, ranges, were, priced, at, 1, 500, 8, 260, in, 2017, dollars, including, a, set, of, high, quality, cookware, made, of, quadraply, a, new, laminate, of, stainless, steel, carbon, steel, aluminum, and, another, layer, of, stainless, steel, outside, to, inside, production, took, place, in, 1973, through, to, 1975, and, stopped, coincidentally, with, the, sale, of, westinghouse, consumer, products, division, to, white, consolidated, industries, inc, modern, day, induction, stoves, are, sold, by, many, manufacturers, including, general, electric, lg, corporation, whirlpool, corporation, ikea, and, samsung, a, kitchen, stove, cooker, or, cookstove, is, a, kitchen, appliance, designed, for, the, purpose, of, cooking, food, kitchen, stoves, rely, on, the, application, of, direct, heat, for, the, cooking, process, and, may, also, contain, an, oven, underneath, or, to, the, side, that, is, used, for, baking, traditionally, these, have, been, fueled, by, wood, the, earliest, known, example, of, such, was, the, castrol, stove, more, modern, versions, such, as, the, popular, rayburn, range, offer, a, choice, between, using, wood, or, gas, stoves, are, also, used, for, heating, purposes, benjamin, franklin, s, invention, in, 1740, popularized, the, widespread, usage, of, modern, heating, stoves, and, fireplaces, today, wood, stoves, are, commonly, used, for, warming, homes, and, are, credited, for, their, cost, effectiveness, compared, to, coal, and, gas, and, connection, to, the, practices, of, human, ancestors, a, wood, burning, stove, or, wood, burner, or, log, burner, in, the, uk, is, a, heating, or, cooking, appliance, capable, of, burning, wood, fuel, and, wood, derived, biomass, fuel, such, as, sawdust, bricks, generally, the, appliance, consists, of, a, solid, metal, usually, cast, iron, or, steel, closed, firebox, often, lined, by, fire, brick, and, one, or, more, air, controls, which, can, be, manually, or, automatically, operated, depending, upon, the, stove, the, first, wood, burning, stove, was, patented, in, strasbourg, in, 1557, two, centuries, before, the, industrial, revolution, which, would, make, iron, an, inexpensive, and, common, material, so, such, stoves, were, high, end, consumer, items, and, only, gradually, spread, in, use, wood, burning, stoves, are, still, commonly, used, today, in, less, developed, countries, the, most, common, stove, for, heating, in, the, industrial, world, for, almost, a, century, and, a, half, was, the, coal, stove, that, burned, coal, coal, stoves, came, in, all, sizes, and, shapes, and, different, operating, principles, coal, burns, at, a, much, higher, temperature, than, wood, and, coal, stoves, must, be, constructed, to, resist, the, high, heat, levels, a, coal, stove, can, burn, either, wood, or, coal, but, a, wood, stove, might, not, burn, coal, unless, a, grate, is, supplied, the, grate, may, be, removable, or, an, extra, this, is, because, coal, stoves, are, fitted, with, a, grate, so, allowing, part, of, the, combustion, air, to, be, admitted, below, the, fire, the, proportion, of, air, admitted, above, below, the, fire, depends, on, the, type, of, coal, brown, coal, and, lignites, evolve, more, combustible, gases, than, say, anthracite, and, so, need, more, air, above, the, fire, the, ratio, of, air, above, below, the, fire, must, be, carefully, adjusted, to, enable, complete, combustion, coal, particularly, anthracite, coal, became, a, popular, option, during, the, 1800s, in, the, united, states, because, it, burned, at, a, high, heat, while, also, producing, little, soot, by, 1860, as, much, as, 90, of, united, states, homes, used, anthracite, coal, as, a, solution, for, the, fuel, crisis, that, the, united, states, faced, one, major, issue, with, the, use, of, coal, burning, stoves, in, the, 1800s, was, limitations, of, storing, the, material, over, time, a, division, between, the, wealthy, and, poor, in, using, coal, stoves, was, that, many, poor, families, could, not, afford, to, store, the, volumes, of, coal, needed, to, heat, homes, for, long, periods, of, time, therefore, while, wealthy, families, could, store, large, amounts, of, coal, in, cellars, poorer, families, often, had, to, purchase, coal, in, smaller, quantities, therefore, difficulties, surrounding, the, storage, of, coal, helped, push, the, use, and, development, of, gas, stoves, gas, stoves, were, first, introduced, by, moravian, zachaus, winzler, in, 1802, today, according, to, the, us, energy, information, administration, 35, of, american, households, use, gas, stoves, they, are, chosen, as, they, offer, better, temperature, control, durability, low, cost, and, speed, of, heating, in, june, 2023, stanford, researchers, found, combustion, from, gas, stoves, can, raise, indoor, levels, of, benzene, a, potent, carcinogen, linked, to, a, higher, risk, of, blood, cell, cancers, gas, powered, stoves, are, criticized, for, environmental, concerns, with, methane, emission, and, the, usage, of, natural, gas, the, danger, of, carbon, monoxide, release, and, difficulty, in, cleaning, for, example, a, january, 2022, stanford, led, study, reveals, that, the, methane, leaking, from, gas, burning, stoves, has, a, climate, impact, comparable, to, the, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, about, 500, 000, gasoline, powered, cars, induction, stoves, were, first, patented, in, the, early, 1900s, these, stoves, are, praised, for, their, cost, effectiveness, ease, of, cleaning, options, to, control, low, heat, and, stable, base, for, many, types, and, sizes, of, pots, and, other, cooking, tools, critics, note, that, abrasive, cleaners, can, damage, induction, stoves, that, gas, has, more, traditional, culinary, associations, and, that, induction, stoves, are, unable, to, operate, during, power, outages, unlike, gas, stoves, induction, stoves, have, no, detectable, benzene, emissions, and, any, benzene, emissions, could, then, be, attributed, to, cooking, food, rather, than, to, the, cooktop, or, fuel, used, compared, to, simple, open, fires, enclosed, stoves, can, offer, greater, efficiency, and, control, in, free, air, solid, fuels, burn, at, a, temperature, of, only, about, 240, c, 464, f, which, is, too, low, a, temperature, for, perfect, combustion, reactions, to, occur, heat, produced, through, convection, is, largely, lost, smoke, particles, are, evolved, without, being, fully, burned, and, the, supply, of, combustion, air, cannot, be, readily, controlled, by, enclosing, the, fire, in, a, chamber, and, connecting, it, to, a, chimney, draft, draught, is, generated, pulling, fresh, air, through, the, burning, fuel, this, causes, the, temperature, of, combustion, to, rise, to, a, point, 600, c, or, 1, 112, f, where, efficient, combustion, is, achieved, the, enclosure, allows, the, ingress, of, air, to, be, regulated, and, losses, by, convection, are, almost, eliminated, it, also, becomes, possible, with, ingenious, design, to, direct, the, flow, of, burned, gasses, inside, the, stove, such, that, smoke, particles, are, heated, and, destroyed, enclosing, a, fire, also, prevents, air, from, being, sucked, from, the, room, into, the, chimney, this, can, represent, a, significant, loss, of, heat, as, an, open, fireplace, can, pull, away, many, cubic, meters, of, heated, air, per, hour, efficiency, is, generally, regarded, as, the, maximum, heat, output, of, a, stove, or, fire, and, is, usually, referred, to, by, manufacturers, as, the, difference, between, heat, to, the, room, and, heat, lost, up, the, chimney, an, early, improvement, was, the, fire, chamber, the, fire, was, enclosed, on, three, sides, by, masonry, walls, and, covered, by, an, iron, plate, only, in, 1735, did, the, first, design, that, completely, enclosed, the, fire, appear, the, castrol, stove, of, the, french, architect, fran, ois, de, cuvilli, s, was, a, masonry, construction, with, several, fireholes, covered, by, perforated, iron, plates, it, is, also, known, as, a, stew, stove, near, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, design, was, refined, by, hanging, the, pots, in, holes, through, the, top, iron, plate, thus, improving, heat, efficiency, even, more, in, 1743, benjamin, franklin, invented, an, all, metal, fireplace, with, an, attempt, to, improve, the, efficiency, it, was, still, an, open, faced, fireplace, but, improved, on, efficiency, compared, to, old, fashioned, fireplaces, some, stoves, use, a, catalytic, converter, which, causes, combustion, of, the, gas, and, smoke, particles, not, previously, burned, other, models, use, a, design, that, includes, firebox, insulation, a, large, baffle, to, produce, a, longer, hotter, gas, flow, path, modern, enclosed, stoves, are, often, built, with, a, window, to, let, out, some, light, and, to, enable, the, user, to, view, progress, of, the, fire, while, enclosed, stoves, are, typically, more, efficient, and, controllable, than, open, fires, there, are, exceptions, the, type, of, water, heating, back, boiler, open, fires, commonly, used, in, ireland, for, instance, can, achieve, more, than, 80, absolute, efficiency, masonry, heaters, were, developed, from, neolithic, times, to, control, air, flow, in, stoves, a, masonry, heater, is, designed, to, allow, complete, combustion, by, burning, fuels, at, full, temperature, with, no, restriction, of, air, inflow, due, to, its, large, thermal, mass, the, captured, heat, is, radiated, over, long, periods, of, time, without, the, need, of, constant, firing, and, the, surface, temperature, is, generally, not, dangerous, to, touch, metal, stoves, came, into, general, use, in, the, 18th, century, an, early, and, famous, example, of, a, metal, stove, the, franklin, stove, was, allegedly, invented, by, benjamin, franklin, in, 1742, it, had, a, labyrinthine, path, for, hot, exhaust, gases, to, escape, thus, allowing, heat, to, enter, the, room, instead, of, going, up, the, chimney, the, franklin, stove, however, was, designed, for, heating, not, for, cooking, benjamin, thompson, 1753, 1814, at, the, turn, to, the, 19th, century, was, among, the, first, to, present, a, working, metal, kitchen, stove, his, rumford, fireplace, of, the, 1790s, used, one, fire, to, heat, several, pots, that, were, also, hung, into, holes, so, that, they, could, be, heated, from, the, sides, too, it, was, even, possible, to, regulate, the, heat, individually, for, each, hole, his, stove, was, designed, for, large, canteen, or, castle, kitchens, though, it, would, take, another, 30, years, before, the, technology, had, been, refined, and, the, size, of, the, iron, stove, been, reduced, enough, for, domestic, use, philo, stewart, s, oberlin, stove, was, a, much, more, compact, wood, burning, cast, iron, stove, patented, in, the, united, states, in, 1834, it, became, a, huge, commercial, success, with, some, 90, 000, units, sold, in, the, next, 30, years, in, europe, similar, designs, also, appeared, in, the, 1830s, in, the, following, years, these, iron, stoves, evolved, into, specialised, cooking, appliances, with, flue, pipes, connected, to, the, chimney, oven, holes, and, installations, for, heating, water, the, originally, open, holes, into, which, the, pots, were, hung, were, now, covered, with, concentric, iron, rings, on, which, the, pots, were, placed, depending, on, the, size, of, the, pot, or, the, heat, needed, one, could, remove, the, inner, rings, nepalese, may, cook, on, a, chulo, or, clay, stove, as, concerns, about, air, pollution, deforestation, and, climate, change, have, increased, new, efforts, have, been, made, to, improve, stove, design, the, largest, strides, have, been, made, in, innovations, for, biomass, burning, stoves, such, as, the, wood, burning, stoves, used, in, many, of, the, world, s, most, populous, countries, these, new, designs, address, the, fundamental, problem, that, wood, and, other, biomass, fires, inefficiently, consume, large, amounts, of, fuel, to, produce, relatively, small, amounts, of, heat, while, producing, fumes, that, cause, significant, indoor, and, environmental, pollutants, the, world, health, organization, has, documented, the, significant, number, of, deaths, caused, by, smoke, from, home, fires, increases, in, efficiency, allow, users, of, stoves, to, spend, less, time, gathering, wood, or, other, fuels, suffer, less, emphysema, and, other, lung, diseases, prevalent, in, smoke, filled, homes, while, reducing, deforestation, and, air, pollution, corn, and, pellet, stoves, and, furnaces, are, a, type, of, biofuel, stove, the, shelled, dry, kernel, of, corn, also, called, a, corn, pellet, creates, as, much, heat, as, a, wood, pellet, but, generates, more, ash, corn, pellet, stoves, and, wood, pellet, stoves, look, the, same, from, the, outside, since, they, are, highly, efficient, they, don, t, need, a, chimney, instead, they, can, be, vented, outdoors, by, a, four, inch, 102, mm, pipe, through, an, outside, wall, and, so, can, be, located, in, any, room, in, the, home, a, pellet, stove, is, a, type, of, clean, burning, stove, that, uses, small, biological, fuel, pellets, which, are, renewable, and, very, clean, burning, home, heating, using, a, pellet, stove, is, an, alternative, currently, used, throughout, the, world, with, rapid, growth, in, europe, the, pellets, are, made, of, renewable, material, typically, wood, sawdust, or, off, cuts, there, are, more, than, half, a, million, homes, in, north, america, using, pellet, stoves, for, heat, and, probably, a, similar, number, in, europe, the, pellet, stove, typically, uses, a, feed, screw, to, transfer, pellets, from, a, storage, hopper, to, a, combustion, chamber, air, is, provided, for, the, combustion, by, an, electric, blower, the, ignition, is, automatic, using, a, stream, of, air, heated, by, an, electrical, element, the, rotation, speed, of, the, feeder, and, the, fan, speeds, can, be, varied, to, modulate, the, heat, output, other, efficient, stoves, are, based, on, top, lit, updraft, t, lud, or, wood, gas, or, smoke, burner, stove, a, principle, applied, and, made, popular, by, dr, thomas, reed, which, use, small, pieces, of, sticks, chips, of, wood, or, shavings, leaves, etc, as, fuel, the, efficiency, is, very, high, up, to, 50, percent, as, compared, to, traditional, stoves, that, are, 5, to, 15, percent, efficient, on, average, stoves, fueled, by, alcohol, such, as, ethanol, offer, another, modern, clean, burning, stove, option, ethanol, fueled, stoves, have, been, made, popular, through, the, work, of, project, gaia, in, africa, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, an, air, tight, stove, is, a, wood, burning, stove, designed, to, burn, solid, fuel, traditionally, wood, in, a, controlled, fashion, so, as, to, provide, for, efficient, and, controlled, fuel, use, and, the, benefits, of, stable, heating, or, cooking, temperatures, they, are, made, of, sheet, metal, consisting, of, a, drum, like, combustion, chamber, with, airflow, openings, that, can, be, open, and, shut, and, a, chimney, of, a, meter, or, more, length, these, stoves, are, used, most, often, to, heat, buildings, in, winter, wood, or, other, fuel, is, put, into, the, stove, lit, and, then, air, flow, is, regulated, to, control, the, burn, the, intake, airflow, is, either, at, the, level, where, fuel, is, added, or, below, it, the, exhaust, smoke, from, the, stove, is, usually, several, meters, above, the, combustion, chamber, most, modern, air, tight, stoves, feature, a, damper, at, the, stove, s, outlet, that, can, be, closed, to, force, the, exhaust, through, an, after, burner, at, the, top, of, the, stove, a, heated, chamber, in, which, the, combustion, process, continues, some, air, tight, stoves, feature, a, catalytic, converter, a, platinum, grid, placed, at, the, stove, outlet, to, burn, remaining, fuel, that, has, not, been, combusted, as, gases, burn, at, a, much, lower, temperature, in, the, presence, of, platinum, using, an, air, tight, stove, initially, requires, leaving, the, damper, and, air, vents, open, until, a, bed, of, coals, has, been, formed, after, that, the, damper, is, closed, and, the, air, vent, regulated, to, slow, down, the, burning, of, the, wood, a, properly, loaded, and, controlled, air, tight, stove, will, burn, safely, without, further, attention, for, eight, hours, or, longer, these, features, provide, a, more, complete, combustion, of, wood, and, elimination, of, polluting, combustion, products, it, also, provides, for, regulation, of, the, intensity, of, fire, by, limiting, air, flow, and, for, the, fire, to, create, a, strong, draught, or, draw, up, the, chimney, this, results, in, highly, efficient, fuel, usage, air, tight, stoves, are, a, more, sophisticated, version, of, traditional, wood, burning, stoves, many, countries, legislate, to, control, emissions, since, 2015, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, phase, iii, woodstove, regulations, in, the, united, states, requiring, that, all, wood, stoves, being, manufactured, limit, particulate, emission, to, 4, 5, grams, per, hour, for, stoves, with, after, burners, or, 2, 5, grams, per, hour, for, stoves, with, catalytic, converters, testing, wood, stove, efficiency, is, limited, to, two, primary, methods, crib, wood, and, cord, wood, in, 2020, wood, stoves, tested, with, crib, wood, must, burn, at, 2, 0, grams, per, hour, as, of, 2020, efficiency, tests, can, also, be, conducted, with, cordwood, and, must, be, below, 2, 5, grams, of, emission, per, hour, according, to, the, epa, cordwood, discussion, paper, these, changes, are, aimed, at, improving, current, test, methods, in, order, to, eventually, develop, an, epa, reference, method, for, cordwood, stoves, and, potentially, for, central, heaters, e, g, hydronic, heaters, boilers, and, forced, air, furnaces, the, burn, temperature, in, modern, stoves, can, increase, to, the, point, where, secondary, and, complete, combustion, of, the, fuel, takes, place, a, properly, fired, masonry, heater, has, little, or, no, particulate, pollution, in, the, exhaust, and, does, not, contribute, to, the, buildup, of, creosote, in, the, heater, flues, or, the, chimney, some, stoves, achieve, as, little, as, 1, to, 4, grams, of, emissions, per, hour, this, is, roughly, 10, as, much, smoke, than, older, stoves, and, equates, to, nearly, zero, visible, smoke, from, the, chimney, this, is, largely, achieved, through, causing, the, maximum, amount, of, material, to, combust, which, results, in, a, net, efficiency, of, 60, to, 70, as, contrasted, to, less, than, 30, for, an, open, fireplace, net, efficiency, is, defined, as, the, amount, of, heat, energy, transferred, to, the, room, compared, to, the, amount, contained, in, the, wood, minus, any, amount, central, heating, must, work, to, compensate, for, airflow, problems, sb, 1256, a, bill, that, would, ban, the, sale, of, disposable, single, use, propane, cylinders, in, california, is, set, to, be, presented, for, approval, to, governor, gavin, newsom, if, signed, into, law, the, ban, would, take, effect, in, january, 2023, and, would, be, the, first, of, its, kind, in, the, united, states, sb, 1256, aims, to, phase, out, the, cylinders, completely, by, 2028, the, state, assembly, and, senate, both, approved, the, legislation, propane, stoves, are, widely, used, by, campers, for, cooking, lighting, and, heating, and, the, spent, gas, canisters, often, pile, up, on, the, ground, near, dumpsters, at, campgrounds, the, bill, is, sponsored, by, the, california, product, stewardship, council, a, nonprofit, local, government, coalition, in, an, effort, to, reduce, waste, and, cut, down, on, the, pile, ups, of, canisters, worthington, industries, a, manufacturer, of, propane, cylinders, has, objected, to, the, bill, on, the, grounds, that, it, would, be, disruptive, to, campers, and, that, it, would, not, improve, the, recycling, rate, of, propane, cylinders, the, company, has, also, argued, that, refillable, cylinders, cost, three, times, as, much, as, single, use, cylinders, the, search, for, safer, cleaner, stoves, remains, to, many, an, important, if, low, profile, area, of, modern, technology, cook, stoves, in, common, use, around, the, world, particularly, in, third, world, countries, are, considered, fire, hazards, and, worse, according, to, the, world, health, organization, a, million, and, a, half, people, die, each, year, from, indoor, smoke, inhalation, caused, by, faulty, stoves, an, engineer, s, stove, camp, has, been, hosted, annually, since, 1999, by, aprovecho, research, center, oregon, us, with, the, intent, of, designing, a, cheap, efficient, and, healthy, cook, stove, for, use, around, the, world, other, engineering, societies, see, envirofit, international, colorado, us, and, philanthropic, groups, see, the, bill, melinda, gates, foundation, california, continue, to, research, and, promote, improved,
