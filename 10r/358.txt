a, bearing, is, a, machine, element, that, constrains, relative, motion, to, only, the, desired, motion, and, reduces, friction, between, moving, parts, the, design, of, the, bearing, may, for, example, provide, for, free, linear, movement, of, the, moving, part, or, for, free, rotation, around, a, fixed, axis, or, it, may, prevent, a, motion, by, controlling, the, vectors, of, normal, forces, that, bear, on, the, moving, parts, most, bearings, facilitate, the, desired, motion, by, minimizing, friction, bearings, are, classified, broadly, according, to, the, type, of, operation, the, motions, allowed, or, the, directions, of, the, loads, forces, applied, to, the, parts, the, term, bearing, is, derived, from, the, verb, to, bear, a, bearing, being, a, machine, element, that, allows, one, part, to, bear, i, e, to, support, another, the, simplest, bearings, are, bearing, surfaces, cut, or, formed, into, a, part, with, varying, degrees, of, control, over, the, form, size, roughness, and, location, of, the, surface, other, bearings, are, separate, devices, installed, into, a, machine, or, machine, part, the, most, sophisticated, bearings, for, the, most, demanding, applications, are, very, precise, components, their, manufacture, requires, some, of, the, highest, standards, of, current, technology, rotary, bearings, hold, rotating, components, such, as, shafts, or, axles, within, mechanical, systems, and, transfer, axial, and, radial, loads, from, the, source, of, the, load, to, the, structure, supporting, it, the, simplest, form, of, bearing, the, plain, bearing, consists, of, a, shaft, rotating, in, a, hole, lubrication, is, used, to, reduce, friction, lubricants, come, in, different, forms, including, liquids, solids, and, gases, the, choice, of, lubricant, depends, on, the, specific, application, and, factors, such, as, temperature, load, and, speed, in, the, ball, bearing, and, roller, bearing, to, reduce, sliding, friction, rolling, elements, such, as, rollers, or, balls, with, a, circular, cross, section, are, located, between, the, races, or, journals, of, the, bearing, assembly, a, wide, variety, of, bearing, designs, exists, to, allow, the, demands, of, the, application, to, be, correctly, met, for, maximum, efficiency, reliability, durability, and, performance, it, is, sometimes, assumed, that, the, invention, of, the, rolling, bearing, in, the, form, of, wooden, rollers, supporting, or, bearing, an, object, being, moved, predates, the, invention, of, a, wheel, rotating, on, a, plain, bearing, this, underlies, speculation, that, cultures, such, as, the, ancient, egyptians, used, roller, bearings, in, the, form, of, tree, trunks, under, sleds, there, is, no, evidence, for, this, sequence, of, technological, development, 31, the, egyptians, own, drawings, in, the, tomb, of, djehutihotep, show, the, process, of, moving, massive, stone, blocks, on, sledges, as, using, liquid, lubricated, runners, which, would, constitute, plain, bearings, 36, 710, there, are, also, egyptian, drawings, of, plain, bearings, used, with, hand, drills, wheeled, vehicles, using, plain, bearings, emerged, between, about, 5000, bc, and, 3000, bc, 15, 30, 37, a, recovered, example, of, an, early, rolling, element, bearing, is, a, wooden, ball, bearing, supporting, a, rotating, table, from, the, remains, of, the, roman, nemi, ships, in, lake, nemi, italy, the, wrecks, were, dated, to, 40, bc, leonardo, da, vinci, incorporated, drawings, of, ball, bearings, in, his, design, for, a, helicopter, around, the, year, 1500, this, is, the, first, recorded, use, of, bearings, in, an, aerospace, design, however, agostino, ramelli, is, the, first, to, have, published, roller, and, thrust, bearings, sketches, an, issue, with, the, ball, and, roller, bearings, is, that, the, balls, or, rollers, rub, against, each, other, causing, additional, friction, this, can, be, reduced, by, enclosing, each, individual, ball, or, roller, within, a, cage, the, captured, or, caged, ball, bearing, was, originally, described, by, galileo, in, the, 17th, century, the, first, practical, caged, roller, bearing, was, invented, in, the, mid, 1740s, by, horologist, john, harrison, for, his, h3, marine, timekeeper, in, this, timepiece, the, caged, bearing, was, only, used, for, a, very, limited, oscillating, motion, but, later, on, harrison, applied, a, similar, bearing, design, with, a, true, rotational, movement, in, a, contemporaneous, regulator, clock, the, first, patent, on, ball, bearings, was, awarded, to, philip, vaughan, a, british, inventor, and, ironmaster, in, carmarthen, in, 1794, his, was, the, first, modern, ball, bearing, design, with, the, ball, running, along, a, groove, in, the, axle, assembly, bearings, played, a, pivotal, role, in, the, nascent, industrial, revolution, allowing, the, new, industrial, machinery, to, operate, efficiently, for, example, they, were, used, for, holding, wheel, and, axle, assemblies, to, greatly, reduce, friction, compared, to, prior, non, bearing, designs, the, first, patent, for, a, radial, style, ball, bearing, was, awarded, to, jules, suriray, a, parisian, bicycle, mechanic, on, 3, august, 1869, the, bearings, were, then, fitted, to, the, winning, bicycle, ridden, by, james, moore, in, the, world, s, first, bicycle, road, race, paris, rouen, in, november, 1869, in, 1883, friedrich, fischer, founder, of, fag, developed, an, approach, for, milling, and, grinding, balls, of, equal, size, and, exact, roundness, by, means, of, a, suitable, production, machine, which, set, the, stage, for, the, creation, of, an, independent, bearing, industry, his, hometown, schweinfurt, later, became, a, world, leading, center, for, ball, bearing, production, the, modern, self, aligning, design, of, ball, bearing, is, attributed, to, sven, wingquist, of, the, skf, ball, bearing, manufacturer, in, 1907, when, he, was, awarded, swedish, patent, no, 25406, on, its, design, henry, timken, a, 19th, century, visionary, and, innovator, in, carriage, manufacturing, patented, the, tapered, roller, bearing, in, 1898, the, following, year, he, formed, a, company, to, produce, his, innovation, over, a, century, the, company, grew, to, make, bearings, of, all, types, including, specialty, steel, bearings, and, an, array, of, related, products, and, services, erich, franke, invented, and, patented, the, wire, race, bearing, in, 1934, his, focus, was, on, a, bearing, design, with, a, cross, section, as, small, as, possible, and, which, could, be, integrated, into, the, enclosing, design, after, world, war, ii, he, founded, with, gerhard, heydrich, the, company, franke, heydrich, kg, today, franke, gmbh, to, push, the, development, and, production, of, wire, race, bearings, richard, stribeck, s, extensive, research, on, ball, bearing, steels, identified, the, metallurgy, of, the, commonly, used, 100cr6, aisi, 52100, showing, coefficient, of, friction, as, a, function, of, pressure, designed, in, 1968, and, later, patented, in, 1972, bishop, wisecarver, s, co, founder, bud, wisecarver, created, vee, groove, bearing, guide, wheels, a, type, of, linear, motion, bearing, consisting, of, both, an, external, and, internal, 90, degree, vee, angle, in, the, early, 1980s, pacific, bearing, s, founder, robert, schroeder, invented, the, first, bi, material, plain, bearing, that, was, interchangeable, with, linear, ball, bearings, this, bearing, had, a, metal, shell, aluminum, steel, or, stainless, steel, and, a, layer, of, teflon, based, material, connected, by, a, thin, adhesive, layer, today, s, ball, and, roller, bearings, are, used, in, many, applications, which, include, a, rotating, component, examples, include, ultra, high, speed, bearings, in, dental, drills, aerospace, bearings, in, the, mars, rover, gearbox, and, wheel, bearings, on, automobiles, flexure, bearings, in, optical, alignment, systems, and, air, bearings, used, in, coordinate, measuring, machines, common, motions, permitted, by, bearings, are, the, first, plain, and, rolling, element, bearings, were, wood, closely, followed, by, bronze, over, their, history, bearings, have, been, made, of, many, materials, including, ceramic, sapphire, glass, steel, bronze, and, other, metals, plastic, bearings, made, of, nylon, polyoxymethylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and, uhmwpe, among, other, materials, are, also, in, use, today, case, hardening, steel, sae, 4118, high, alloy, steel, m50nil, watchmakers, produce, jeweled, watches, using, sapphire, plain, bearings, to, reduce, friction, thus, allowing, more, precise, timekeeping, even, basic, materials, can, have, impressive, durability, wooden, bearings, for, instance, can, still, be, seen, today, in, old, clocks, or, in, water, mills, where, the, water, provides, cooling, and, lubrication, by, far, the, most, common, bearing, is, the, plain, bearing, a, bearing, that, uses, surfaces, in, rubbing, contact, often, with, a, lubricant, such, as, oil, or, graphite, a, plain, bearing, may, or, may, not, be, a, discrete, device, it, may, be, nothing, more, than, the, bearing, surface, of, a, hole, with, a, shaft, passing, through, it, or, of, a, planar, surface, that, bears, another, in, these, cases, not, a, discrete, device, or, it, may, be, a, layer, of, bearing, metal, either, fused, to, the, substrate, semi, discrete, or, in, the, form, of, a, separable, sleeve, discrete, with, suitable, lubrication, plain, bearings, often, give, acceptable, accuracy, life, and, friction, at, minimal, cost, therefore, they, are, very, widely, used, however, there, are, many, applications, where, a, more, suitable, bearing, can, improve, efficiency, accuracy, service, intervals, reliability, speed, of, operation, size, weight, and, costs, of, purchasing, and, operating, machinery, thus, many, types, of, bearings, have, varying, shapes, materials, lubrication, principle, of, operation, and, so, on, there, are, at, least, 6, common, types, of, bearing, each, of, which, operates, on, a, different, principle, the, following, table, summarizes, the, notable, characteristics, of, each, of, these, bearing, types, reducing, friction, in, bearings, is, often, important, for, efficiency, to, reduce, wear, and, to, facilitate, extended, use, at, high, speeds, and, to, avoid, overheating, and, premature, failure, of, the, bearing, essentially, a, bearing, can, reduce, friction, by, virtue, of, its, shape, by, its, material, or, by, introducing, and, containing, a, fluid, between, surfaces, or, by, separating, the, surfaces, with, an, electromagnetic, field, combinations, of, these, can, even, be, employed, within, the, same, bearing, an, example, is, where, the, cage, is, made, of, plastic, and, it, separates, the, rollers, balls, which, reduce, friction, by, their, shape, and, finish, bearing, design, varies, depending, on, the, size, and, directions, of, the, forces, required, to, support, forces, can, be, predominately, radial, axial, thrust, bearings, or, bending, moments, perpendicular, to, the, main, axis, different, bearing, types, have, different, operating, speed, limits, speed, is, typically, specified, as, maximum, relative, surface, speeds, often, specified, ft, s, or, m, s, rotational, bearings, typically, describe, performance, in, terms, of, the, product, dn, where, d, is, the, mean, diameter, often, in, mm, of, the, bearing, and, n, is, the, rotation, rate, in, revolutions, per, minute, generally, there, is, considerable, speed, range, overlap, between, bearing, types, plain, bearings, typically, handle, only, lower, speeds, rolling, element, bearings, are, faster, followed, by, fluid, bearings, and, finally, magnetic, bearings, which, are, limited, ultimately, by, centripetal, force, overcoming, material, strength, some, applications, apply, bearing, loads, from, varying, directions, and, accept, only, limited, play, or, slop, as, the, applied, load, changes, one, source, of, motion, is, gaps, or, play, in, the, bearing, for, example, a, 10, mm, shaft, in, a, 12, mm, hole, has, 2, mm, play, allowable, play, varies, greatly, depending, on, the, use, as, an, example, a, wheelbarrow, wheel, supports, radial, and, axial, loads, axial, loads, may, be, hundreds, of, newtons, force, left, or, right, and, it, is, typically, acceptable, for, the, wheel, to, wobble, by, as, much, as, 10, mm, under, the, varying, load, in, contrast, a, lathe, may, position, a, cutting, tool, to, 0, 002, mm, using, a, ball, lead, screw, held, by, rotating, bearings, the, bearings, support, axial, loads, of, thousands, of, newtons, in, either, direction, and, must, hold, the, ball, lead, screw, to, 0, 002, mm, across, that, range, of, loads, stiffness, is, the, amount, that, the, gap, varies, when, the, load, on, the, bearing, changes, distinct, from, the, friction, of, the, bearing, a, second, source, of, motion, is, elasticity, in, the, bearing, itself, for, example, the, balls, in, a, ball, bearing, are, like, stiff, rubber, and, under, load, deform, from, a, round, to, a, slightly, flattened, shape, the, race, is, also, elastic, and, develops, a, slight, dent, where, the, ball, presses, on, it, the, stiffness, of, a, bearing, is, how, the, distance, between, the, parts, separated, by, the, bearing, varies, with, the, applied, load, with, rolling, element, bearings, this, is, due, to, the, strain, of, the, ball, and, race, with, fluid, bearings, it, is, due, to, how, the, pressure, of, the, fluid, varies, with, the, gap, when, correctly, loaded, fluid, bearings, are, typically, stiffer, than, rolling, element, bearings, some, bearings, use, a, thick, grease, for, lubrication, which, is, pushed, into, the, gaps, between, the, bearing, surfaces, also, known, as, packing, the, grease, is, held, in, place, by, a, plastic, leather, or, rubber, gasket, also, called, a, gland, that, covers, the, inside, and, outside, edges, of, the, bearing, race, to, keep, the, grease, from, escaping, bearings, may, also, be, packed, with, other, materials, historically, the, wheels, on, railroad, cars, used, sleeve, bearings, packed, with, waste, or, loose, scraps, of, cotton, or, wool, fiber, soaked, in, oil, then, later, used, solid, pads, of, cotton, bearings, can, be, lubricated, by, a, ring, oiler, a, metal, ring, that, rides, loosely, on, the, central, rotating, shaft, of, the, bearing, the, ring, hangs, down, into, a, chamber, containing, lubricating, oil, as, the, bearing, rotates, viscous, adhesion, draws, oil, up, the, ring, and, onto, the, shaft, where, the, oil, migrates, into, the, bearing, to, lubricate, it, excess, oil, is, flung, off, and, collects, in, the, pool, again, a, rudimentary, form, of, lubrication, is, splash, lubrication, some, machines, contain, a, pool, of, lubricant, in, the, bottom, with, gears, partially, immersed, in, the, liquid, or, crank, rods, that, can, swing, down, into, the, pool, as, the, device, operates, the, spinning, wheels, fling, oil, into, the, air, around, them, while, the, crank, rods, slap, at, the, surface, of, the, oil, splashing, it, randomly, on, the, engine, s, interior, surfaces, some, small, internal, combustion, engines, specifically, contain, special, plastic, flinger, wheels, which, randomly, scatter, oil, around, the, interior, of, the, mechanism, for, high, speed, and, high, power, machines, a, loss, of, lubricant, can, result, in, rapid, bearing, heating, and, damage, due, to, friction, also, in, dirty, environments, the, oil, can, become, contaminated, with, dust, or, debris, increasing, friction, in, these, applications, a, fresh, supply, of, lubricant, can, be, continuously, supplied, to, the, bearing, and, all, other, contact, surfaces, and, the, excess, can, be, collected, for, filtration, cooling, and, possibly, reuse, pressure, oiling, is, commonly, used, in, large, and, complex, internal, combustion, engines, in, parts, of, the, engine, where, directly, splashed, oil, cannot, reach, such, as, up, into, overhead, valve, assemblies, high, speed, turbochargers, also, typically, require, a, pressurized, oil, system, to, cool, the, bearings, and, keep, them, from, burning, up, due, to, the, heat, from, the, turbine, composite, bearings, are, designed, with, a, self, lubricating, polytetrafluorethylene, ptfe, liner, with, a, laminated, metal, backing, the, ptfe, liner, offers, consistent, controlled, friction, as, well, as, durability, whilst, the, metal, backing, ensures, the, composite, bearing, is, robust, and, capable, of, withstanding, high, loads, and, stresses, throughout, its, long, life, its, design, also, makes, it, lightweight, one, tenth, the, weight, of, a, traditional, rolling, element, bearing, there, are, many, methods, of, mounting, bearings, usually, involving, an, interference, fit, when, press, fitting, or, shrink, fitting, a, bearing, into, a, bore, or, onto, a, shaft, it, s, important, to, keep, the, housing, bore, and, shaft, outer, diameter, to, very, close, limits, which, can, involve, one, or, more, counterboring, operations, several, facing, operations, and, drilling, tapping, and, threading, operations, alternatively, an, interference, fit, can, also, be, achieved, with, the, addition, of, a, tolerance, ring, the, service, life, of, the, bearing, is, affected, by, many, factors, not, controlled, by, the, bearing, manufacturers, for, example, bearing, mounting, temperature, exposure, to, external, environment, lubricant, cleanliness, and, electrical, currents, through, bearings, high, frequency, pwm, inverters, can, induce, electric, currents, in, a, bearing, which, can, be, suppressed, by, the, use, of, ferrite, chokes, the, temperature, and, terrain, of, the, micro, surface, will, determine, the, amount, of, friction, by, touching, solid, parts, certain, elements, and, fields, reduce, friction, while, increasing, speeds, strength, and, mobility, help, determine, the, load, the, bearing, type, can, carry, alignment, factors, can, play, a, damaging, role, in, wear, and, tear, yet, overcome, by, computer, aid, signaling, and, non, rubbing, bearing, types, such, as, magnetic, levitation, or, air, field, pressure, fluid, and, magnetic, bearings, can, have, practically, indefinite, service, lives, in, practice, fluid, bearings, support, high, loads, in, hydroelectric, plants, that, have, been, in, nearly, continuous, service, since, about, 1900, and, show, no, signs, of, wear, rolling, element, bearing, life, is, determined, by, load, temperature, maintenance, lubrication, material, defects, contamination, handling, installation, and, other, factors, these, factors, can, all, have, a, significant, effect, on, bearing, life, for, example, the, service, life, of, bearings, in, one, application, was, extended, dramatically, by, changing, how, the, bearings, were, stored, before, installation, and, use, as, vibrations, during, storage, caused, lubricant, failure, even, when, the, only, load, on, the, bearing, was, its, own, weight, the, resulting, damage, is, often, false, brinelling, bearing, life, is, statistical, several, samples, of, a, given, bearing, will, often, exhibit, a, bell, curve, of, service, life, with, a, few, samples, showing, significantly, better, or, worse, life, bearing, life, varies, because, microscopic, structure, and, contamination, vary, greatly, even, where, macroscopically, they, seem, identical, bearings, are, often, specified, to, give, an, l10, us, or, b10, elsewhere, life, the, duration, by, which, ten, percent, of, the, bearings, in, that, application, can, be, expected, to, have, failed, due, to, classical, fatigue, failure, and, not, any, other, mode, of, failure, such, as, lubrication, starvation, wrong, mounting, etc, or, alternatively, the, duration, at, which, ninety, percent, will, still, be, operating, the, l10, b10, life, of, the, bearing, is, theoretical, and, may, not, represent, service, life, of, the, bearing, bearings, are, also, rated, using, the, c, 0, static, loading, value, this, is, the, basic, load, rating, as, a, reference, and, not, an, actual, load, value, for, plain, bearings, some, materials, give, a, much, longer, life, than, others, some, of, the, john, harrison, clocks, still, operate, after, hundreds, of, years, because, of, the, lignum, vitae, wood, employed, in, their, construction, whereas, his, metal, clocks, are, seldom, run, due, to, potential, wear, flexure, bearings, rely, on, elastic, properties, of, a, material, flexure, bearings, bend, a, piece, of, material, repeatedly, some, materials, fail, after, repeated, bending, even, at, low, loads, but, careful, material, selection, and, bearing, design, can, make, flexure, bearing, life, indefinite, although, long, bearing, life, is, often, desirable, it, is, sometimes, not, necessary, harris, 2001, describes, a, bearing, for, a, rocket, motor, oxygen, pump, that, gave, several, hours, life, far, in, excess, of, the, several, tens, of, minutes, needed, depending, on, the, customized, specifications, backing, material, and, ptfe, compounds, composite, bearings, can, operate, up, to, 30, years, without, maintenance, for, bearings, which, are, used, in, oscillating, applications, customized, approaches, to, calculate, l10, b10, are, used, many, bearings, require, periodic, maintenance, to, prevent, premature, failure, but, others, require, little, maintenance, the, latter, include, various, kinds, of, polymer, fluid, and, magnetic, bearings, as, well, as, rolling, element, bearings, that, are, described, with, terms, including, sealed, bearing, and, sealed, for, life, these, contain, seals, to, keep, the, dirt, out, and, the, grease, in, they, work, successfully, in, many, applications, providing, maintenance, free, operation, some, applications, cannot, use, them, effectively, nonsealed, bearings, often, have, a, grease, fitting, for, periodic, lubrication, with, a, grease, gun, or, an, oil, cup, for, periodic, filling, with, oil, before, the, 1970s, sealed, bearings, were, not, encountered, on, most, machinery, and, oiling, and, greasing, were, a, more, common, activity, than, they, are, today, for, example, automotive, chassis, used, to, require, lube, jobs, nearly, as, often, as, engine, oil, changes, but, today, s, car, chassis, are, mostly, sealed, for, life, from, the, late, 1700s, through, the, mid, 1900s, industry, relied, on, many, workers, called, oilers, to, lubricate, machinery, frequently, with, oil, cans, factory, machines, today, usually, have, lube, systems, in, which, a, central, pump, serves, periodic, charges, of, oil, or, grease, from, a, reservoir, through, lube, lines, to, the, various, lube, points, in, the, machine, s, bearing, surfaces, bearing, journals, pillow, blocks, and, so, on, the, timing, and, number, of, such, lube, cycles, is, controlled, by, the, machine, s, computerized, control, such, as, plc, or, cnc, as, well, as, by, manual, override, functions, when, occasionally, needed, this, automated, process, is, how, all, modern, cnc, machine, tools, and, many, other, factory, machines, are, lubricated, similar, lube, systems, are, also, used, on, nonautomated, machines, in, which, case, there, is, a, hand, pump, that, a, machine, operator, is, supposed, to, pump, once, daily, for, machines, in, constant, use, or, once, weekly, these, are, called, one, shot, systems, from, their, chief, selling, point, one, pull, on, one, handle, to, lube, the, whole, machine, instead, of, a, dozen, pumps, of, an, alemite, gun, or, oil, can, in, a, dozen, different, positions, around, the, machine, the, oiling, system, inside, a, modern, automotive, or, truck, engine, is, similar, in, concept, to, the, lube, systems, mentioned, above, except, that, oil, is, pumped, continuously, much, of, this, oil, flows, through, passages, drilled, or, cast, into, the, engine, block, and, cylinder, heads, escaping, through, ports, directly, onto, bearings, and, squirting, elsewhere, to, provide, an, oil, bath, the, oil, pump, simply, pumps, constantly, and, any, excess, pumped, oil, continuously, escapes, through, a, relief, valve, back, into, the, sump, many, bearings, in, high, cycle, industrial, operations, need, periodic, lubrication, and, cleaning, and, many, require, occasional, adjustment, such, as, pre, load, adjustment, to, minimize, the, effects, of, wear, bearing, life, is, often, much, better, when, the, bearing, is, kept, clean, and, well, lubricated, however, many, applications, make, good, maintenance, difficult, one, example, is, bearings, in, the, conveyor, of, a, rock, crusher, are, exposed, continually, to, hard, abrasive, particles, cleaning, is, of, little, use, because, cleaning, is, expensive, yet, the, bearing, is, contaminated, again, as, soon, as, the, conveyor, resumes, operation, thus, a, good, maintenance, program, might, lubricate, the, bearings, frequently, but, not, include, any, disassembly, for, cleaning, the, frequent, lubrication, by, its, nature, provides, a, limited, kind, of, cleaning, action, by, displacing, older, grit, filled, oil, or, grease, with, a, fresh, charge, which, itself, collects, grit, before, being, displaced, by, the, next, cycle, another, example, are, bearings, in, wind, turbines, which, makes, maintenance, difficult, since, the, nacelle, is, placed, high, up, in, the, air, in, strong, wind, areas, in, addition, the, turbine, does, not, always, run, and, is, subjected, to, different, operating, behavior, in, different, weather, conditions, which, makes, proper, lubrication, a, challenge, manufacturers
