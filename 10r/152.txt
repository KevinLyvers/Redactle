nanotechnology, is, the, manipulation, of, matter, with, at, least, one, dimension, sized, from, 1, to, 100, nanometers, nm, at, this, scale, commonly, known, as, the, nanoscale, surface, area, and, quantum, mechanical, effects, become, important, in, describing, properties, of, matter, this, definition, of, nanotechnology, includes, all, types, of, research, and, technologies, that, deal, with, these, special, properties, it, is, common, to, see, the, plural, form, nanotechnologies, as, well, as, nanoscale, technologies, to, refer, to, research, and, applications, whose, common, trait, is, scale, an, earlier, understanding, of, nanotechnology, referred, to, the, particular, technological, goal, of, precisely, manipulating, atoms, and, molecules, for, fabricating, macroscale, products, now, referred, to, as, molecular, nanotechnology, nanotechnology, defined, by, scale, includes, fields, of, science, such, as, surface, science, organic, chemistry, molecular, biology, semiconductor, physics, energy, storage, engineering, microfabrication, and, molecular, engineering, the, associated, research, and, applications, range, from, extensions, of, conventional, device, physics, to, molecular, self, assembly, from, developing, new, materials, with, dimensions, on, the, nanoscale, to, direct, control, of, matter, on, the, atomic, scale, nanotechnology, may, be, able, to, create, new, materials, and, devices, with, diverse, applications, such, as, in, nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials, energy, production, and, consumer, products, however, nanotechnology, raises, issues, including, concerns, about, the, toxicity, and, environmental, impact, of, nanomaterials, and, their, potential, effects, on, global, economics, as, well, as, various, doomsday, scenarios, these, concerns, have, led, to, a, debate, among, advocacy, groups, and, governments, on, whether, special, regulation, of, nanotechnology, is, warranted, the, concepts, that, seeded, nanotechnology, were, first, discussed, in, 1959, by, physicist, richard, feynman, in, his, talk, there, s, plenty, of, room, at, the, bottom, in, which, he, described, the, possibility, of, synthesis, via, direct, manipulation, of, atoms, the, term, nano, technology, was, first, used, by, norio, taniguchi, in, 1974, though, it, was, not, widely, known, inspired, by, feynman, s, concepts, k, eric, drexler, used, the, term, nanotechnology, in, his, 1986, book, engines, of, creation, the, coming, era, of, nanotechnology, which, proposed, the, idea, of, a, nanoscale, assembler, that, would, be, able, to, build, a, copy, of, itself, and, of, other, items, of, arbitrary, complexity, with, atom, level, control, also, in, 1986, drexler, co, founded, the, foresight, institute, to, increase, public, awareness, and, understanding, of, nanotechnology, concepts, and, implications, the, emergence, of, nanotechnology, as, a, field, in, the, 1980s, occurred, through, the, convergence, of, drexler, s, theoretical, and, public, work, which, developed, and, popularized, a, conceptual, framework, and, high, visibility, experimental, advances, that, drew, additional, attention, to, the, prospects, in, the, 1980s, two, breakthroughs, sparked, the, growth, of, nanotechnology, first, the, invention, of, the, scanning, tunneling, microscope, in, 1981, enabled, visualization, of, individual, atoms, and, bonds, and, was, successfully, used, to, manipulate, individual, atoms, in, 1989, the, microscope, s, developers, gerd, binnig, and, heinrich, rohrer, at, ibm, zurich, research, laboratory, received, a, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1986, binnig, quate, and, gerber, also, invented, the, analogous, atomic, force, microscope, that, year, second, fullerenes, buckyballs, were, discovered, in, 1985, by, harry, kroto, richard, smalley, and, robert, curl, who, together, won, the, 1996, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, c, 60, was, not, initially, described, as, nanotechnology, the, term, was, used, regarding, subsequent, work, with, related, carbon, nanotubes, sometimes, called, graphene, tubes, or, bucky, tubes, which, suggested, potential, applications, for, nanoscale, electronics, and, devices, the, discovery, of, carbon, nanotubes, is, largely, attributed, to, sumio, iijima, of, nec, in, 1991, for, which, iijima, won, the, inaugural, 2008, kavli, prize, in, nanoscience, in, the, early, 2000s, the, field, garnered, increased, scientific, political, and, commercial, attention, that, led, to, both, controversy, and, progress, controversies, emerged, regarding, the, definitions, and, potential, implications, of, nanotechnologies, exemplified, by, the, royal, society, s, report, on, nanotechnology, challenges, were, raised, regarding, the, feasibility, of, applications, envisioned, by, advocates, of, molecular, nanotechnology, which, culminated, in, a, public, debate, between, drexler, and, smalley, in, 2001, and, 2003, meanwhile, commercial, products, based, on, advancements, in, nanoscale, technologies, began, emerging, these, products, were, limited, to, bulk, applications, of, nanomaterials, and, did, not, involve, atomic, control, of, matter, some, examples, include, the, silver, nano, platform, for, using, silver, nanoparticles, as, an, antibacterial, agent, nanoparticle, based, sunscreens, carbon, fiber, strengthening, using, silica, nanoparticles, and, carbon, nanotubes, for, stain, resistant, textiles, governments, moved, to, promote, and, fund, research, into, nanotechnology, such, as, american, the, national, nanotechnology, initiative, which, formalized, a, size, based, definition, of, nanotechnology, and, established, research, funding, and, in, europe, via, the, european, framework, programmes, for, research, and, technological, development, by, the, mid, 2000s, scientific, attention, began, to, flourish, nanotechnology, roadmaps, centered, on, atomically, precise, manipulation, of, matter, and, discussed, existing, and, projected, capabilities, goals, and, applications, nanotechnology, is, the, science, and, engineering, of, functional, systems, at, the, molecular, scale, in, its, original, sense, nanotechnology, refers, to, the, projected, ability, to, construct, items, from, the, bottom, up, making, complete, high, performance, products, one, nanometer, nm, is, one, billionth, or, 10, 9, of, a, meter, by, comparison, typical, carbon, carbon, bond, lengths, or, the, spacing, between, these, atoms, in, a, molecule, are, in, the, range, 0, 12, 0, 15, nm, and, dna, s, diameter, is, around, 2, nm, on, the, other, hand, the, smallest, cellular, life, forms, the, bacteria, of, the, genus, mycoplasma, are, around, 200, nm, in, length, by, convention, nanotechnology, is, taken, as, the, scale, range, 1, to, 100, nm, following, the, definition, used, by, the, american, national, nanotechnology, initiative, the, lower, limit, is, set, by, the, size, of, atoms, hydrogen, has, the, smallest, atoms, which, have, an, approximately, 25, nm, kinetic, diameter, the, upper, limit, is, more, or, less, arbitrary, but, is, around, the, size, below, which, phenomena, not, observed, in, larger, structures, start, to, become, apparent, and, can, be, made, use, of, these, phenomena, make, nanotechnology, distinct, from, devices, that, are, merely, miniaturized, versions, of, an, equivalent, macroscopic, device, such, devices, are, on, a, larger, scale, and, come, under, the, description, of, microtechnology, to, put, that, scale, in, another, context, the, comparative, size, of, a, nanometer, to, a, meter, is, the, same, as, that, of, a, marble, to, the, size, of, the, earth, two, main, approaches, are, used, in, nanotechnology, in, the, bottom, up, approach, materials, and, devices, are, built, from, molecular, components, which, assemble, themselves, chemically, by, principles, of, molecular, recognition, in, the, top, down, approach, nano, objects, are, constructed, from, larger, entities, without, atomic, level, control, areas, of, physics, such, as, nanoelectronics, nanomechanics, nanophotonics, and, nanoionics, have, evolved, to, provide, nanotechnology, s, scientific, foundation, several, phenomena, become, pronounced, as, system, size, these, include, statistical, mechanical, effects, as, well, as, quantum, mechanical, effects, for, example, the, quantum, size, effect, in, which, the, electronic, properties, of, solids, alter, along, with, reductions, in, particle, size, such, effects, do, not, apply, at, macro, or, micro, dimensions, however, quantum, effects, can, become, significant, when, nanometer, scales, additionally, physical, mechanical, electrical, optical, etc, properties, change, versus, macroscopic, systems, one, example, is, the, increase, in, surface, area, to, volume, ratio, altering, mechanical, thermal, and, catalytic, properties, of, materials, diffusion, and, reactions, can, be, different, as, well, systems, with, fast, ion, transport, are, referred, to, as, nanoionics, the, mechanical, properties, of, nanosystems, are, of, interest, in, research, modern, synthetic, chemistry, can, prepare, small, molecules, of, almost, any, structure, these, methods, are, used, to, manufacture, a, wide, variety, of, useful, chemicals, such, as, pharmaceuticals, or, commercial, polymers, this, ability, raises, the, question, of, extending, this, kind, of, control, to, the, next, larger, level, seeking, methods, to, assemble, single, molecules, into, supramolecular, assemblies, consisting, of, many, molecules, arranged, in, a, well, defined, manner, these, approaches, utilize, the, concepts, of, molecular, self, assembly, and, or, supramolecular, chemistry, to, automatically, arrange, themselves, into, a, useful, conformation, through, a, bottom, up, approach, the, concept, of, molecular, recognition, is, important, molecules, can, be, designed, so, that, a, specific, configuration, or, arrangement, is, favored, due, to, non, covalent, intermolecular, forces, the, watson, crick, basepairing, rules, are, a, direct, result, of, this, as, is, the, specificity, of, an, enzyme, targeting, a, single, substrate, or, the, specific, folding, of, a, protein, thus, components, can, be, designed, to, be, complementary, and, mutually, attractive, so, that, they, make, a, more, complex, and, useful, whole, such, bottom, up, approaches, should, be, capable, of, producing, devices, in, parallel, and, be, much, cheaper, than, top, down, methods, but, could, potentially, be, overwhelmed, as, the, size, and, complexity, of, the, desired, assembly, increases, most, useful, structures, require, complex, and, thermodynamically, unlikely, arrangements, of, atoms, nevertheless, many, examples, of, self, assembly, based, on, molecular, recognition, in, exist, in, biology, most, notably, watson, crick, basepairing, and, enzyme, substrate, interactions, molecular, nanotechnology, sometimes, called, molecular, manufacturing, concerns, engineered, nanosystems, nanoscale, machines, operating, on, the, molecular, scale, molecular, nanotechnology, is, especially, associated, with, molecular, assemblers, machines, that, can, produce, a, desired, structure, or, device, atom, by, atom, using, the, principles, of, mechanosynthesis, manufacturing, in, the, context, of, productive, nanosystems, is, not, related, to, conventional, technologies, used, to, manufacture, nanomaterials, such, as, carbon, nanotubes, and, nanoparticles, when, drexler, independently, coined, and, popularized, the, term, nanotechnology, he, envisioned, manufacturing, technology, based, on, molecular, machine, systems, the, premise, was, that, molecular, scale, biological, analogies, of, traditional, machine, components, demonstrated, molecular, machines, were, possible, biology, was, full, of, examples, of, sophisticated, stochastically, optimized, biological, machines, drexler, and, other, researchers, have, proposed, that, advanced, nanotechnology, ultimately, could, be, based, on, mechanical, engineering, principles, namely, a, manufacturing, technology, based, on, the, mechanical, functionality, of, these, components, such, as, gears, bearings, motors, and, structural, members, that, would, enable, programmable, positional, assembly, to, atomic, specification, the, physics, and, engineering, performance, of, exemplar, designs, were, analyzed, in, drexler, s, book, nanosystems, molecular, machinery, manufacturing, and, computation, in, general, assembling, devices, on, the, atomic, scale, requires, positioning, atoms, on, other, atoms, of, comparable, size, and, stickiness, carlo, montemagno, s, view, is, that, future, nanosystems, will, be, hybrids, of, silicon, technology, and, biological, molecular, machines, richard, smalley, argued, that, mechanosynthesis, was, impossible, due, to, difficulties, in, mechanically, manipulating, individual, molecules, this, led, to, an, exchange, of, letters, in, the, acs, publication, chemical, engineering, news, in, 2003, though, biology, clearly, demonstrates, that, molecular, machines, are, possible, non, biological, molecular, machines, remained, in, their, infancy, alex, zettl, and, colleagues, at, lawrence, berkeley, laboratories, and, uc, berkeley, constructed, at, least, three, molecular, devices, whose, motion, is, controlled, via, changing, voltage, a, nanotube, nanomotor, a, molecular, actuator, and, a, nanoelectromechanical, relaxation, oscillator, ho, and, lee, at, cornell, university, in, 1999, used, a, scanning, tunneling, microscope, to, move, an, individual, carbon, monoxide, molecule, co, to, an, individual, iron, atom, fe, sitting, on, a, flat, silver, crystal, and, chemically, bound, the, co, to, the, fe, by, applying, a, voltage, many, areas, of, science, develop, or, study, materials, having, unique, properties, arising, from, their, nanoscale, dimensions, the, bottom, up, approach, seeks, to, arrange, smaller, components, into, more, complex, assemblies, these, seek, to, create, smaller, devices, by, using, larger, ones, to, direct, their, assembly, functional, approaches, seek, to, develop, useful, components, without, regard, to, how, they, might, be, assembled, these, subfields, seek, to, anticipate, what, inventions, nanotechnology, might, yield, or, attempt, to, propose, an, agenda, along, which, inquiry, could, progress, these, often, take, a, big, picture, view, with, more, emphasis, on, societal, implications, than, engineering, details, nanomaterials, can, be, classified, in, 0d, 1d, 2d, and, 3d, nanomaterials, dimensionality, plays, a, major, role, in, determining, the, characteristic, of, nanomaterials, including, physical, chemical, and, biological, characteristics, with, the, decrease, in, dimensionality, an, increase, in, surface, to, volume, ratio, is, observed, this, indicates, that, smaller, dimensional, nanomaterials, have, higher, surface, area, compared, to, 3d, nanomaterials, two, dimensional, 2d, nanomaterials, have, been, extensively, investigated, for, electronic, biomedical, drug, delivery, and, biosensor, applications, the, atomic, force, microscope, afm, and, the, scanning, tunneling, microscope, stm, are, two, versions, of, scanning, probes, that, are, used, for, nano, scale, observation, other, types, of, scanning, probe, microscopy, have, much, higher, resolution, since, they, are, not, limited, by, the, wavelengths, of, sound, or, light, the, tip, of, a, scanning, probe, can, also, be, used, to, manipulate, nanostructures, positional, assembly, feature, oriented, scanning, may, be, a, promising, way, to, implement, these, nano, scale, manipulations, via, an, automatic, algorithm, however, this, is, still, a, slow, process, because, of, low, velocity, of, the, microscope, the, top, down, approach, anticipates, nanodevices, that, must, be, built, piece, by, piece, in, stages, much, as, manufactured, items, are, made, scanning, probe, microscopy, is, an, important, technique, both, for, characterization, and, synthesis, atomic, force, microscopes, and, scanning, tunneling, microscopes, can, be, used, to, look, at, surfaces, and, to, move, atoms, around, by, designing, different, tips, for, these, microscopes, they, can, be, used, for, carving, out, structures, on, surfaces, and, to, help, guide, self, assembling, structures, by, using, for, example, feature, oriented, scanning, approach, atoms, or, molecules, can, be, moved, around, on, a, surface, with, scanning, probe, microscopy, techniques, various, techniques, of, lithography, such, as, optical, lithography, x, ray, lithography, dip, pen, lithography, electron, beam, lithography, or, nanoimprint, lithography, offer, top, down, fabrication, techniques, where, a, bulk, material, is, reduced, to, a, nano, scale, pattern, another, group, of, nano, technological, techniques, include, those, used, for, fabrication, of, nanotubes, and, nanowires, those, used, in, semiconductor, fabrication, such, as, deep, ultraviolet, lithography, electron, beam, lithography, focused, ion, beam, machining, nanoimprint, lithography, atomic, layer, deposition, and, molecular, vapor, deposition, and, further, including, molecular, self, assembly, techniques, such, as, those, employing, di, block, copolymers, in, contrast, bottom, up, techniques, build, or, grow, larger, structures, atom, by, atom, or, molecule, by, molecule, these, techniques, include, chemical, synthesis, self, assembly, and, positional, assembly, dual, polarization, interferometry, is, one, tool, suitable, for, characterization, of, self, assembled, thin, films, another, variation, of, the, bottom, up, approach, is, molecular, beam, epitaxy, or, mbe, researchers, at, bell, telephone, laboratories, including, john, r, arthur, alfred, y, cho, and, art, c, gossard, developed, and, implemented, mbe, as, a, research, tool, in, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s, samples, made, by, mbe, were, key, to, the, discovery, of, the, fractional, quantum, hall, effect, for, which, the, 1998, nobel, prize, in, physics, was, awarded, mbe, lays, down, atomically, precise, layers, of, atoms, and, in, the, process, build, up, complex, structures, important, for, research, on, semiconductors, mbe, is, also, widely, used, to, make, samples, and, devices, for, the, newly, emerging, field, of, spintronics, therapeutic, products, based, on, responsive, nanomaterials, such, as, the, highly, deformable, stress, sensitive, transfersome, vesicles, are, approved, for, human, use, in, some, countries, as, of, august, 21, 2008, the, project, on, emerging, nanotechnologies, estimated, that, over, 800, manufacturer, identified, nanotech, products, were, publicly, available, with, new, ones, hitting, the, market, at, a, pace, of, 3, 4, per, week, most, applications, are, first, generation, passive, nanomaterials, that, includes, titanium, dioxide, in, sunscreen, cosmetics, surface, coatings, and, some, food, products, carbon, allotropes, used, to, produce, gecko, tape, silver, in, food, packaging, clothing, disinfectants, and, household, appliances, zinc, oxide, in, sunscreens, and, cosmetics, surface, coatings, paints, and, outdoor, furniture, varnishes, and, cerium, oxide, as, a, fuel, catalyst, in,

bandages, are, infused, with, silver, nanoparticles, to, heal, cuts, faster, video, game, consoles, and, personal, computers, may, become, cheaper, faster, and, contain, more, memory, thanks, to, nanotechnology, also, to, build, structures, for, on, chip, computing, with, light, for, example, on, chip, optical, quantum, information, processing, and, picosecond, transmission, of, information, nanotechnology, may, have, the, ability, to, make, existing, medical, applications, cheaper, and, easier, to, use, in, places, like, the, doctors, offices, and, at, homes, cars, use, nanomaterials, in, such, ways, that, car, parts, require, fewer, metals, during, manufacturing, and, less, fuel, to, operate, in, the, future, nanoencapsulation, involves, the, enclosure, of, active, substances, within, carriers, typically, these, carriers, offer, advantages, such, as, enhanced, bioavailability, controlled, release, targeted, delivery, and, protection, of, the, encapsulated, substances, in, the, medical, field, nanoencapsulation, plays, a, significant, role, in, drug, delivery, it, facilitates, more, efficient, drug, administration, reduces, side, effects, and, increases, treatment, effectiveness, nanoencapsulation, is, particularly, useful, for, improving, the, bioavailability, of, poorly, water, soluble, drugs, enabling, controlled, and, sustained, drug, release, and,

nanotechnology, one, concern, is, the, effect, that, industrial, scale, manufacturing, and, use, of, nanomaterials, will, have, on, human, health, and, the, environment, as, suggested, by, nanotoxicology, research, for, these, reasons, some, groups, advocate, that, nanotechnology, be, regulated, however, regulation, might, stifle, scientific, research, and, the, development, of, beneficial, innovations, public, health, research, agencies, such, as, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, research, potential, health, effects, stemming, from, exposures, to, nanoparticles, nanoparticle, products, may, have, unintended, consequences, researchers, have, discovered, that, bacteriostatic, silver, nanoparticles, used, in, socks, to, reduce, foot, odor, are, released, in, the, wash, these, particles, are, then, flushed, into, the, wastewater, stream, and, may, destroy, bacteria, that, are, critical, components, of, natural, ecosystems, farms, and, waste, treatment, processes, public, deliberations, on, risk, perception, in, the, us, and, uk, carried, out, by, the, center, for, nanotechnology, in, society, found, that, participants, were, more, positive, about, nanotechnologies, for, energy, applications, than, for, health, applications, with, health, applications, raising, moral, and, ethical, dilemmas, such, as, cost, and, availability, experts, including, director, of, the, woodrow, wilson, center, s, project, on, emerging, nanotechnologies, david, rejeski, testified, that, commercialization, depends, on, adequate, oversight, risk, research, strategy, and, public, engagement, as, of, 206, berkeley, california, was, the, only, us, city, to, regulate, nanotechnology, inhaling, airborne, nanoparticles, and, nanofibers, may, contribute, to, pulmonary, diseases, e, g, fibrosis, researchers, found, that, when, rats, breathed, in, nanoparticles, the, particles, settled, in, the, brain, and, lungs, which, led, to, significant, increases, in, biomarkers, for, inflammation, and, stress, response, and, that, nanoparticles, induce, skin, aging, through, oxidative, stress, in, hairless, mice, a, two, year, study, at, ucla, s, school, of, public, health, found, lab, mice, consuming, nano, titanium, dioxide, showed, dna, and, chromosome, damage, to, a, degree, linked, to, all, the, big, killers, of, man, namely, cancer, heart, disease, neurological, disease, and, aging, a, nature, nanotechnology, study, suggested, that, some, forms, of, carbon, nanotubes, could, be, as, harmful, as, asbestos, if, inhaled, in, sufficient, quantities, anthony, seaton, of, the, institute, of, occupational, medicine, in, edinburgh, scotland, who, contributed, to, the, article, on, carbon, nanotubes, said, we, know, that, some, of, them, probably, have, the, potential, to, cause, mesothelioma, so, those, sorts, of, materials, need, to, be, handled, very, carefully, in, the, absence, of, specific, regulation, forthcoming, from, governments, paull, and, lyons, 2008, have, called, for, an, exclusion, of, engineered, nanoparticles, in, food, a, newspaper, article, reports, that, workers, in, a, paint, factory, developed, serious, lung, disease, and, nanoparticles, were, found, in, their, lungs, calls, for, tighter, regulation, of, nanotechnology, have, accompanied, a, debate, related, to, human, health, and, safety, risks, some, regulatory, agencies, cover, some, nanotechnology, products, and, processes, by, bolting, on, nanotechnology, to, existing, regulations, leaving, clear, gaps, davies, proposed, a, road, map, describing, steps, to, deal, with, these, shortcomings, andrew, maynard, chief, science, advisor, to, the, woodrow, wilson, center, s, project, on, emerging, nanotechnologies, reported, insufficient, funding, for, human, health, and, safety, research, and, as, a, result, inadequate, understanding, of, human, health, and, safety, risks, some, academics, called, for, stricter, application, of, the, precautionary, principle, slowing, marketing, approval, enhanced, labelling, and, additional, safety, data, a, royal, society, report, identified, a, risk, of, nanoparticles, or, nanotubes, being, released, during, disposal, destruction, and, recycling, and, recommended, that, manufacturers, of, products, that, fall, under, extended, producer, responsibility, regimes, such, as, end, of, life, regulations, publish, procedures, outlining, how, these, materials, will, be, managed, to, minimize, possible, human, and, environmental, exposure
