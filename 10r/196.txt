a, watermill, or, water, mill, is, a, mill, that, uses, hydropower, it, is, a, structure, that, uses, a, water, wheel, or, water, turbine, to, drive, a, mechanical, process, such, as, milling, grinding, rolling, or, hammering, such, processes, are, needed, in, the, production, of, many, material, goods, including, flour, lumber, paper, textiles, and, many, metal, products, these, watermills, may, comprise, gristmills, sawmills, paper, mills, textile, mills, hammermills, trip, hammering, mills, rolling, mills, and, wire, drawing, mills, one, major, way, to, classify, watermills, is, by, wheel, orientation, vertical, or, horizontal, one, powered, by, a, vertical, waterwheel, through, a, gear, mechanism, and, the, other, equipped, with, a, horizontal, waterwheel, without, such, a, mechanism, the, former, type, can, be, further, subdivided, depending, on, where, the, water, hits, the, wheel, paddles, into, undershot, overshot, breastshot, and, pitchback, backshot, or, reverse, shot, waterwheel, mills, another, way, to, classify, water, mills, is, by, an, essential, trait, about, their, location, tide, mills, use, the, movement, of, the, tide, ship, mills, are, water, mills, onboard, and, constituting, a, ship, watermills, impact, the, river, dynamics, of, the, watercourses, where, they, are, installed, during, the, time, watermills, operate, channels, tend, to, sedimentate, particularly, backwater, also, in, the, backwater, area, inundation, events, and, sedimentation, of, adjacent, floodplains, increase, over, time, however, these, effects, are, cancelled, by, river, banks, becoming, higher, where, mills, have, been, removed, river, incision, increases, and, channels, deepen, there, are, two, basic, types, of, watermills, one, powered, by, a, vertical, waterwheel, via, a, gear, mechanism, and, the, other, equipped, with, a, horizontal, waterwheel, without, such, a, mechanism, the, former, type, can, be, further, divided, depending, on, where, the, water, hits, the, wheel, paddles, into, undershot, overshot, breastshot, and, reverse, shot, waterwheel, mills, the, greeks, invented, the, two, main, components, of, watermills, the, waterwheel, and, toothed, gearing, and, used, along, with, the, romans, undershot, overshot, and, breastshot, waterwheel, mills, the, earliest, evidence, of, a, water, driven, wheel, appears, in, the, technical, treatises, pneumatica, and, parasceuastica, of, the, greek, engineer, philo, of, byzantium, ca, 280, 220, bc, the, british, historian, of, technology, m, j, t, lewis, has, shown, that, those, portions, of, philo, of, byzantium, s, mechanical, treatise, which, describe, water, wheels, and, which, have, been, previously, regarded, as, later, arabic, interpolations, actually, date, back, to, the, greek, 3rd, century, bc, original, the, sakia, gear, is, already, fully, developed, for, the, first, time, attested, in, a, 2nd, century, bc, hellenistic, wall, painting, in, ptolemaic, egypt, lewis, assigns, the, date, of, the, invention, of, the, horizontal, wheeled, mill, to, the, greek, colony, of, byzantium, in, the, first, half, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, that, of, the, vertical, wheeled, mill, to, ptolemaic, alexandria, around, 240, bc, the, greek, geographer, strabo, reports, in, his, geography, a, water, powered, grain, mill, to, have, existed, near, the, palace, of, king, mithradates, vi, eupator, at, cabira, asia, minor, before, 71, bc, the, roman, engineer, vitruvius, has, the, first, technical, description, of, a, watermill, dated, to, 40, 10, bc, the, device, is, fitted, with, an, undershot, wheel, and, power, is, transmitted, via, a, gearing, mechanism, he, also, seems, to, indicate, the, existence, of, water, powered, kneading, machines, the, greek, epigrammatist, antipater, of, thessalonica, tells, of, an, advanced, overshot, wheel, mill, around, 20, bc, 10, ad, he, praised, for, its, use, in, grinding, grain, and, the, reduction, of, human, labour, hold, back, your, hand, from, the, mill, you, grinding, girls, even, if, the, cockcrow, heralds, the, dawn, sleep, on, for, demeter, has, imposed, the, labours, of, your, hands, on, the, nymphs, who, leaping, down, upon, the, topmost, part, of, the, wheel, rotate, its, axle, with, encircling, cogs, it, turns, the, hollow, weight, of, the, nisyrian, millstones, if, we, learn, to, feast, toil, free, on, the, fruits, of, the, earth, we, taste, again, the, golden, age, the, roman, encyclopedist, pliny, mentions, in, his, naturalis, historia, of, around, 70, ad, water, powered, trip, hammers, operating, in, the, greater, part, of, italy, there, is, evidence, of, a, fulling, mill, in, 73, 74, ad, in, antioch, roman, syria, the, 2nd, century, ad, multiple, mill, complex, of, barbegal, in, southern, france, has, been, described, as, the, greatest, known, concentration, of, mechanical, power, in, the, ancient, world, it, featured, 16, overshot, waterwheels, to, power, an, equal, number, of, flour, mills, the, capacity, of, the, mills, has, been, estimated, at, 4, 5, tons, of, flour, per, day, sufficient, to, supply, enough, bread, for, the, 12, 500, inhabitants, occupying, the, town, of, arelate, at, that, time, a, similar, mill, complex, existed, on, the, janiculum, hill, whose, supply, of, flour, for, rome, s, population, was, judged, by, emperor, aurelian, important, enough, to, be, included, in, the, aurelian, walls, in, the, late, 3rd, century, a, breastshot, wheel, mill, dating, to, the, late, 2nd, century, ad, was, excavated, at, les, martres, de, veyre, france, the, 3rd, century, ad, hierapolis, water, powered, stone, sawmill, is, the, earliest, known, machine, to, incorporate, the, mechanism, of, a, crank, and, connecting, rod, further, sawmills, also, powered, by, crank, and, connecting, rod, mechanisms, are, archaeologically, attested, for, the, 6th, century, ad, water, powered, stone, sawmills, at, gerasa, and, ephesus, literary, references, to, water, powered, marble, saws, in, what, is, now, germany, can, be, found, in, ausonius, 4th, century, ad, poem, mosella, they, also, seem, to, be, indicated, about, the, same, time, by, the, christian, saint, gregory, of, nyssa, from, anatolia, demonstrating, a, diversified, use, of, water, power, in, many, parts, of, the, roman, empire, the, earliest, turbine, mill, was, found, in, chemtou, and, testour, roman, north, africa, dating, to, the, late, 3rd, or, early, 4th, century, ad, a, possible, water, powered, furnace, has, been, identified, at, marseille, france, mills, were, commonly, used, for, grinding, grain, into, flour, attested, by, pliny, the, elder, but, industrial, uses, as, fulling, and, sawing, marble, were, also, applied, the, romans, used, both, fixed, and, floating, water, wheels, and, introduced, water, power, to, other, provinces, of, the, roman, empire, so, called, greek, mills, used, water, wheels, with, a, horizontal, wheel, and, vertical, shaft, a, roman, mill, features, a, vertical, wheel, on, a, horizontal, shaft, greek, style, mills, are, the, older, and, simpler, of, the, two, designs, but, only, operate, well, with, high, water, velocities, and, with, small, diameter, millstones, roman, style, mills, are, more, complicated, as, they, require, gears, to, transmit, the, power, from, a, shaft, with, a, horizontal, axis, to, one, with, a, vertical, axis, although, to, date, only, a, few, dozen, roman, mills, are, archaeologically, traced, the, widespread, use, of, aqueducts, in, the, period, suggests, that, many, remain, to, be, discovered, recent, excavations, in, roman, london, for, example, have, uncovered, what, appears, to, be, a, tide, mill, together, with, a, possible, sequence, of, mills, worked, by, an, aqueduct, running, along, the, side, of, the, river, fleet, in, 537, ad, ship, mills, were, ingeniously, used, by, the, east, roman, general, belisarius, when, the, besieging, goths, cut, off, the, water, supply, for, those, mills, these, floating, mills, had, a, wheel, that, was, attached, to, a, boat, moored, in, a, fast, flowing, river, the, surviving, evidence, for, watermills, sharply, increases, with, the, emergence, of, documentary, genres, such, as, monastic, charters, christian, hagiography, and, germanic, legal, codes, these, were, more, inclined, to, address, watermilling, a, mostly, rural, work, process, than, the, ancient, urban, centered, literary, class, had, been, by, carolingian, times, references, to, watermills, had, become, innumerable, in, frankish, records, the, domesday, book, compiled, in, 1086, records, 5, 624, watermills, in, england, alone, later, research, estimates, a, less, conservative, number, of, 6, 082, that, should, be, considered, a, minimum, as, the, northern, reaches, of, england, were, never, properly, recorded, in, 1300, this, number, had, risen, to, between, 10, 000, and, 15, 000, by, the, early, 7th, century, watermills, were, also, well, established, in, ireland, a, century, later, they, began, to, spread, across, the, former, roman, rhine, and, danube, frontier, into, the, other, parts, of, germany, ship, mills, and, tide, mills, both, of, which, yet, unattested, for, the, ancient, period, were, introduced, in, the, 6th, century, in, recent, years, a, number, of, new, archaeological, finds, has, consecutively, pushed, back, the, date, of, the, earliest, tide, mills, all, of, which, were, discovered, on, the, irish, coast, a, 6th, century, vertical, wheeled, tide, mill, was, located, at, killoteran, near, waterford, a, twin, flume, horizontal, wheeled, tide, mill, dating, to, c, 630, was, excavated, on, little, island, alongside, it, another, tide, mill, was, found, which, was, powered, by, a, vertical, undershot, wheel, the, nendrum, monastery, mill, from, 787, was, situated, on, an, island, in, strangford, lough, in, northern, ireland, its, millstones, are, 830, mm, in, diameter, and, the, horizontal, wheel, is, estimated, to, have, developed, 7, 8, horsepower, 650, w, at, its, peak, remains, of, an, earlier, mill, dated, at, 619, were, also, found, at, the, site, in, a, 2005, survey, the, scholar, adam, lucas, identified, the, following, first, appearances, of, various, industrial, mill, types, in, western, europe, noticeable, is, the, preeminent, role, of, france, in, the, introduction, of, new, innovative, uses, of, waterpower, however, he, has, drawn, attention, to, the, dearth, of, studies, of, the, subject, in, several, other, countries, the, waterwheel, was, found, in, china, from, 30, ad, onwards, when, it, was, used, to, power, trip, hammers, the, bellows, in, smelting, iron, and, in, one, case, to, mechanically, rotate, an, armillary, sphere, for, astronomical, observation, see, zhang, heng, although, the, british, chemist, and, sinologist, joseph, needham, speculates, that, the, water, powered, millstone, could, have, existed, in, han, china, by, the, 1st, century, ad, there, is, no, sufficient, literary, evidence, for, it, until, the, 5th, century, ad, in, 488, ad, the, mathematician, and, engineer, zu, chongzhi, had, a, watermill, erected, which, was, inspected, by, emperor, wu, of, southern, qi, r, 482, 493, ad, the, engineer, yang, su, of, the, sui, dynasty, 581, 618, ad, was, said, to, operate, hundreds, of, them, by, the, beginning, of, the, 6th, century, a, source, written, in, 612, ad, mentions, buddhist, monks, arguing, over, the, revenues, gained, from, watermills, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ad, ordinances, of, the, department, of, waterways, written, in, 737, ad, stated, that, watermills, should, not, interrupt, riverine, transport, and, in, some, cases, were, restricted, to, use, in, certain, seasons, of, the, year, from, other, tang, era, sources, of, the, 8th, century, it, is, known, that, these, ordinances, were, taken, very, seriously, as, the, government, demolished, many, watermills, owned, by, great, families, merchants, and, buddhist, abbeys, that, failed, to, acknowledge, ordinances, or, meet, government, regulations, a, eunuch, serving, emperor, xuanzong, of, tang, r, 712, 756, ad, owned, a, watermill, by, 748, ad, which, employed, five, waterwheels, that, ground, 300, bushels, of, wheat, a, day, by, 610, or, 670, ad, the, watermill, was, introduced, to, japan, via, korean, peninsula, it, also, became, known, in, tibet, by, at, least, 641, ad, according, to, greek, historical, tradition, india, received, water, mills, from, the, roman, empire, in, the, early, 4th, century, ad, when, a, certain, metrodoros, introduced, water, mills, and, baths, unknown, among, them, till, then, engineers, under, the, caliphates, adopted, watermill, technology, from, former, provinces, of, the, byzantine, empire, having, been, applied, for, centuries, in, those, provinces, prior, to, the, muslim, conquests, including, modern, day, syria, jordan, israel, algeria, tunisia, morocco, and, spain, see, list, of, ancient, watermills, the, industrial, uses, of, watermills, in, the, islamic, world, date, back, to, the, 7th, century, while, horizontal, wheeled, and, vertical, wheeled, watermills, were, both, in, widespread, use, by, the, 9th, century, a, variety, of, industrial, watermills, were, used, in, the, islamic, world, including, gristmills, hullers, sawmills, ship, mills, stamp, mills, steel, mills, sugar, mills, and, tide, mills, by, the, 11th, century, every, province, throughout, the, islamic, world, had, these, industrial, watermills, in, operation, from, al, andalus, and, north, africa, to, the, middle, east, and, central, asia, muslim, and, middle, eastern, christian, engineers, also, used, crankshafts, and, water, turbines, gears, in, watermills, and, water, raising, machines, and, dams, as, a, source, of, water, used, to, provide, additional, power, to, watermills, and, water, raising, machines, fulling, mills, and, steel, mills, may, have, spread, from, al, andalus, to, christian, spain, in, the, 12th, century, industrial, watermills, were, also, employed, in, large, factory, complexes, built, in, al, andalus, between, the, 11th, and, 13th, centuries, the, engineers, of, the, islamic, world, used, several, solutions, to, achieve, the, maximum, output, from, a, watermill, one, solution, was, to, mount, them, to, piers, of, bridges, to, take, advantage, of, the, increased, flow, another, solution, was, the, ship, mill, a, type, of, watermill, powered, by, water, wheels, mounted, on, the, sides, of, ships, moored, in, midstream, this, technique, was, employed, along, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, in, 10th, century, iraq, where, large, ship, mills, made, of, teak, and, iron, could, produce, 10, tons, of, flour, from, corn, every, day, for, the, granary, in, baghdad, more, than, 300, watermills, were, at, work, in, iran, till, 1960, now, only, a, few, are, still, working, one, of, the, famous, ones, is, the, water, mill, of, askzar, and, the, water, mill, of, the, yazd, city, still, producing, flour, typically, water, is, diverted, from, a, river, or, impoundment, or, mill, pond, to, a, turbine, or, water, wheel, along, a, channel, or, pipe, variously, known, as, a, flume, head, race, mill, race, leat, leet, lade, scots, or, penstock, the, force, of, the, water, s, movement, drives, the, blades, of, a, wheel, or, turbine, which, in, turn, rotates, an, axle, that, drives, the, mill, s, other, machinery, water, leaving, the, wheel, or, turbine, is, drained, through, a, tail, race, but, this, channel, may, also, be, the, head, race, of, yet, another, wheel, turbine, or, mill, the, passage, of, water, is, controlled, by, sluice, gates, that, allow, maintenance, and, some, measure, of, flood, control, large, mill, complexes, may, have, dozens, of, sluices, controlling, complicated, interconnected, races, that, feed, multiple, buildings, and, industrial, processes, watermills, can, be, divided, into, two, kinds, one, with, a, horizontal, water, wheel, on, a, vertical, axle, and, the, other, with, a, vertical, wheel, on, a, horizontal, axle, the, oldest, of, these, were, horizontal, mills, in, which, the, force, of, the, water, striking, a, simple, paddle, wheel, set, horizontally, in, line, with, the, flow, turned, a, runner, stone, balanced, on, the, rynd, which, is, atop, a, shaft, leading, directly, up, from, the, wheel, the, bedstone, does, not, turn, the, problem, with, this, type, of, mill, arose, from, the, lack, of, gearing, the, speed, of, the, water, directly, set, the, maximum, speed, of, the, runner, stone, which, in, turn, set, the, rate, of, milling, most, watermills, in, britain, and, the, united, states, of, america, had, a, vertical, waterwheel, one, of, four, kinds, undershot, breast, shot, overshot, and, pitchback, wheels, this, vertical, produced, rotary, motion, around, a, horizontal, axis, which, could, be, used, with, cams, to, lift, hammers, in, a, forge, fulling, stocks, in, a, fulling, mill, and, so, on, however, in, corn, mills, rotation, about, a, vertical, axis, was, required, to, drive, its, stones, the, horizontal, rotation, was, converted, into, the, vertical, rotation, by, means, of, gearing, which, also, enabled, the, runner, stones, to, turn, faster, than, the, waterwheel, the, usual, arrangement, in, british, and, american, corn, mills, has, been, for, the, waterwheel, to, turn, a, horizontal, shaft, on, which, is, also, mounted, a, large, pit, wheel, this, meshes, with, the, wallower, mounted, on, a, vertical, shaft, which, turns, the, larger, great, spur, wheel, mounted, on, the, same, shaft, this, large, face, wheel, set, with, pegs, in, turn, turned, a, smaller, wheel, such, as, a, lantern, gear, known, as, a, stone, nut, which, was, attached, to, the, shaft, that, drove, the, runner, stone, the, number, of, runner, stones, that, could, be, turned, depended, directly, upon, the, supply, of, water, available, as, waterwheel, technology, improved, mills, became, more, efficient, and, by, the, 19th, century, it, was, common, for, the, great, spur, wheel, to, drive, several, stone, nuts, so, that, a, single, water, wheel, could, drive, as, many, as, four, stones, each, step, in, the, process, increased, the, gear, ratio, which, increased, the, maximum, speed, of, the, runner, stone, adjusting, the, sluice, gate, and, thus, the, flow, of, the, water, past, the, main, wheel, allowed, the, miller, to, compensate, for, seasonal, variations, in, the, water, supply, finer, speed, adjustment, was, made, during, the, milling, process, by, tentering, that, is, adjusting, the, gap, between, the, stones, according, to, the, water, flow, the, type, of, grain, being, milled, and, the, grade, of, flour, required, in, many, mills, including, the, earliest, the, great, spur, wheel, turned, only, one, stone, but, there, might, be, several, mills, under, one, roof, the, earliest, illustration, of, a, single, waterwheel, driving, more, than, one, set, of, stones, was, drawn, by, henry, beighton, in, 1723, and, published, in, 1744, by, j, t, desaguliers, the, overshot, wheel, was, a, later, innovation, in, waterwheels, and, was, around, two, and, a, half, times, more, efficient, than, the, undershot, the, undershot, wheel, in, which, the, main, water, wheel, is, simply, set, into, the, flow, of, the, mill, race, suffers, from, an, inherent, inefficiency, stemming, from, the, fact, that, the, wheel, itself, entering, the, water, behind, the, main, thrust, of, the, flow, driving, the, wheel, followed, by, the, lift, of, the, wheel, out, of, the, water, ahead, of, the, main, thrust, actually, impedes, its, own, operation, the, overshot, wheel, solves, this, problem, by, bringing, the, water, flow, to, the, top, of, the, wheel, the, water, fills, buckets, built, into, the, wheel, rather, than, the, simple, paddle, wheel, design, of, undershot, wheels, as, the, buckets, fill, the, weight, of, the, water, starts, to, turn, the, wheel, the, water, spills, out, of, the, bucket, on, the, down, side, into, a, spillway, leading, back, to, river, since, the, wheel, itself, is, set, above, the, spillway, the, water, never, impedes, the, speed, of, the, wheel, the, impulse, of, the, water, on, the, wheel, is, also, harnessed, in, addition, to, the, weight, of, the, water, once, in, the, buckets, overshot, wheels, require, the, construction, of, a, dam, on, the, river, above, the, mill, and, a, more, elaborate, millpond, sluice, gate, mill, race, and, spillway, or, tailrace, an, inherent, problem, in, the, overshot, mill, is, that, it, reverses, the, rotation, of, the, wheel, if, a, miller, wishes, to, convert, a, breastshot, mill, to, an, overshot, wheel, all, the, machinery, in, the, mill, has, to, be, rebuilt, to, take, account, of, the, change, in, rotation, an, alternative, solution, was, the, pitchback, or, backshot, wheel, a, launder, was, placed, at, the, end, of, the, flume, on, the, headrace, this, turned, the, direction, of, the, water, without, much, loss, of, energy, and, the, direction, of, rotation, was, maintained, daniels, mill, near, bewdley, worcestershire, is, an, example, of, a, flour, mill, that, originally, used, a, breastshot, wheel, but, was, converted, to, use, a, pitchback, wheel, today, it, operates, as, a, breastshot, mill, larger, water, wheels, usually, overshot, steel, wheels, transmit, the, power, from, a, toothed, annular, ring, that, is, mounted, near, the, outer, edge, of, the, wheel, this, drives, the, machinery, using, a, spur, gear, mounted, on, a, shaft, rather, than, taking, power, from, the, central, axle, however, the, basic, mode, of, operation, remains, the, same, gravity, drives, machinery, through, the, motion, of, flowing, water, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, invention, of, the, pelton, wheel, encouraged, some, mill, owners, to, replace, over, and, undershot, wheels, with, pelton, wheel, turbines, driven, through, penstocks, a, different, type, of, watermill, is, the, tide, mill, this, mill, might, be, of, any, kind, undershot, overshot, or, horizontal, but, it, does, not, employ, a, river, for, its, power, source, instead, a, mole, or, causeway, is, built, across, the, mouth, of, a, small, bay, at, low, tide, gates, in, the, mole, are, opened, allowing, the, bay, to, fill, with, the, incoming, tide, at, high, tide, the, gates, are, closed, trapping, the, water, inside, at, a, certain, point, a, sluice, gate, in, the, mole, can, be, opened, allowing, the, draining, water, to, drive, a, mill, wheel, or, wheels, this, is, particularly, effective, in, places, where, the, tidal, differential, is, very, great, such, as, the, bay, of, fundy, in, canada, where, the, tides, can, rise, fifty, feet, or, the, now, derelict, village, of, tide, mills, east, sussex, the, last, two, examples, in, the, united, kingdom, which, are, restored, to, working, conditions, can, be, visited, at, eling, hampshire, and, at, woodbridge, suffolk, run, of, the, river, schemes, do, not, divert, water, at, all, and, usually, involve, undershot, wheels, the, mills, are, mostly, on, the, banks, of, sizeable, rivers, or, fast, flowing, streams, other, watermills, were, set, beneath, large, bridges, where, the, flow, of, water, between, the, stanchions, was, faster, at, one, point, london, bridge, had, so, many, water, wheels, beneath, it, that, bargemen, complained, that, passage, through, the, bridge, was, impaired, in, 1870, watermills, still, produced, 2, 3, of, the, power, available, for, british, grain, milling, by, the, early, 20th, century, availability, of, cheap, electrical, energy, made, the, watermill, obsolete, in, developed, countries, although, some, smaller, rural, mills, continued, to, operate, commercially, later, throughout, the, century, a, few, historic, mills, such, as, the, water, mill, newlin, mill, and, yates, mill, in, the, us, and, the, darley, mill, centre, in, the, uk, still, operate, for, demonstration, purposes, small, scale, commercial, production, is, carried, out, in, the, uk, at, daniels, mill, little, salkeld, mill, and, redbournbury, mill, this, was, boosted, to, overcome, flour, shortages, during, the, covid, pandemic, some, old, mills, are, being, upgraded, with, modern, hydropower, technology, such, as, those, worked, on, by, the, south, somerset, hydropower, group, in, the, uk, in, some, developing, countries, watermills, are, still, widely, used, for, processing, grain, for, example, there, are, thought, to, be, 25, 000, operating, in, nepal, and, 200, 000, in, india, many, of, these, are, still, of, the, traditional, style, but, some, have, been, upgraded, by, replacing, wooden, parts, with, better, designed, metal, ones, to, improve, the, efficiency, for, example, the, centre, for, rural, technology, in, nepal, upgraded, 2, 400, mills, between, 2003, and, 2007, this, is, also, the, period, when, water, mills, started, to, spread, outside, the, former, empire, according, to, cedrenus, historiarum, compendium, a, certain, metrodoros, who, went, to, india, in, c, ad, 325, constructed, water, mills, and, baths, unknown, among, them, till, then
