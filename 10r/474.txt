cardiopulmonary, bypass, cpb, or, heart, lung, machine, also, called, the, pump, or, cpb, pump, is, a, machine, that, temporarily, takes, over, the, function, of, the, heart, and, lungs, during, open, heart, surgery, by, maintaining, the, circulation, of, blood, and, oxygen, throughout, the, body, as, such, it, is, an, extracorporeal, device, cpb, is, operated, by, a, perfusionist, the, machine, mechanically, circulates, and, oxygenates, blood, throughout, the, patient, s, body, while, bypassing, the, heart, and, lungs, allowing, the, surgeon, to, work, in, a, bloodless, surgical, field, cpb, is, commonly, used, in, operations, or, surgical, procedures, involving, the, heart, the, technique, allows, the, surgical, team, to, oxygenate, and, circulate, the, patient, s, blood, thus, allowing, the, surgeon, to, operate, safely, on, the, heart, in, many, operations, such, as, coronary, artery, bypass, grafting, cabg, the, heart, is, arrested, due, to, the, degree, of, the, difficulty, of, operating, on, a, beating, heart, operations, requiring, the, opening, of, the, chambers, of, the, heart, for, example, mitral, valve, repair, or, replacement, requires, the, use, of, cpb, this, is, to, avoid, engulfing, air, systemically, and, to, provide, a, bloodless, field, to, increase, visibility, for, the, surgeon, the, machine, pumps, the, blood, and, using, an, oxygenator, allows, red, blood, cells, to, pick, up, oxygen, as, well, as, allowing, carbon, dioxide, levels, to, decrease, this, mimics, the, function, of, the, heart, and, the, lungs, respectively, cpb, can, be, used, for, the, induction, of, total, body, hypothermia, a, state, in, which, the, body, can, be, maintained, for, up, to, 45, minutes, without, perfusion, blood, flow, if, blood, flow, is, stopped, at, normal, body, temperature, permanent, brain, damage, can, occur, in, three, to, four, minutes, death, may, follow, similarly, cpb, can, be, used, to, rewarm, individuals, who, have, hypothermia, this, rewarming, method, of, using, cpb, is, successful, if, the, core, temperature, of, the, patient, is, above, 16, c, the, blood, is, cooled, during, cpb, and, is, returned, to, the, body, the, cooled, blood, slows, the, body, s, basal, metabolic, rate, decreasing, its, demand, for, oxygen, cooled, blood, usually, has, a, higher, viscosity, but, the, various, crystalloid, or, colloidal, solutions, that, are, used, to, prime, the, bypass, tubing, serve, to, dilute, the, blood, maintaining, appropriate, blood, pressure, for, organs, is, a, challenge, but, it, is, monitored, carefully, during, the, procedure, hypothermia, is, also, maintained, if, necessary, and, the, body, temperature, is, usually, kept, at, 28, to, 32, c, 82, to, 90, f, extracorporeal, membrane, oxygenation, ecmo, is, a, simplified, version, of, the, heart, lung, machine, that, includes, a, centrifugal, pump, and, an, oxygenator, to, temporarily, take, over, the, function, of, heart, and, or, the, lungs, ecmo, is, useful, for, post, cardiac, surgery, patients, with, cardiac, or, pulmonary, dysfunction, patients, with, acute, pulmonary, failure, massive, pulmonary, embolisms, lung, trauma, from, infections, and, a, range, of, other, problems, that, impair, cardiac, or, pulmonary, function, ecmo, gives, the, heart, and, or, lungs, time, to, repair, and, recover, but, is, only, a, temporary, solution, patients, with, terminal, conditions, cancer, severe, nervous, system, damage, uncontrolled, sepsis, and, other, conditions, may, not, be, candidates, for, ecmo, there, are, no, absolute, contraindications, to, cardiopulmonary, bypass, however, there, are, several, factors, that, need, to, be, considered, by, the, care, team, when, planning, an, operation, heparin, induced, thrombocytopenia, and, heparin, induced, thrombocytopenia, and, thrombosis, are, potentially, life, threatening, conditions, associated, with, the, administration, of, heparin, in, both, of, these, conditions, antibodies, against, heparin, are, formed, which, causes, platelet, activation, and, the, formation, of, blood, clots, because, heparin, is, typically, used, in, cpb, patients, who, are, known, to, have, the, antibodies, responsible, for, heparin, induced, thrombocytopenia, and, heparin, induced, thrombocytopenia, and, thrombosis, require, alternative, forms, of, anticoagulation, bivalirudin, is, the, most, studied, heparin, alternative, in, people, with, heparin, induced, thrombocytopenia, and, heparin, induced, thrombocytopenia, and, thrombosis, requiring, cpb, a, small, percentage, of, patients, such, as, those, with, an, antithrombin, iii, deficiency, may, exhibit, resistance, to, heparin, in, these, patients, patients, may, need, additional, heparin, fresh, frozen, plasma, or, other, blood, products, such, as, recombinant, anti, thrombin, iii, to, achieve, adequate, anticoagulation, a, persistent, left, superior, vena, cava, is, thoracic, system, variation, in, which, the, left, sided, vena, cava, fails, to, involute, during, normal, development, it, is, the, most, common, variation, of, the, thoracic, venous, system, occurring, in, approximately, 0, 3, of, the, population, the, abnormality, is, often, detected, on, pre, operative, imaging, studies, but, may, also, be, discovered, intra, operatively, a, persistent, left, superior, vena, cava, may, make, it, difficult, to, achieve, proper, venous, drainage, or, deliver, of, retrograde, cardioplegia, management, of, a, persistent, left, superior, vena, cava, during, cpb, depends, on, factors, such, as, the, size, and, drainage, site, of, the, vena, cava, variation, cpb, is, not, without, risk, and, there, are, a, number, of, associated, problems, as, a, consequence, cpb, is, only, used, during, the, several, hours, a, cardiac, surgery, may, take, cpb, is, known, to, activate, the, coagulation, cascade, and, stimulate, inflammatory, mediators, leading, to, hemolysis, and, coagulopathies, this, problem, worsens, as, complement, proteins, build, on, the, membrane, oxygenators, for, this, reason, most, oxygenators, come, with, a, manufacturer, s, recommendation, that, they, are, only, used, for, a, maximum, of, six, hours, although, they, are, sometimes, used, for, up, to, ten, hours, with, care, being, taken, to, ensure, they, do, not, clot, off, and, stop, working, for, longer, periods, than, this, a, membrane, oxygenator, is, used, which, can, be, in, operation, for, up, to, 31, days, such, as, in, a, taiwanese, case, for, 16, days, after, which, the, patient, received, a, heart, transplant, the, most, common, complication, associated, with, cpb, is, a, protamine, reaction, during, anticoagulation, reversal, there, are, three, types, of, protamine, reactions, and, each, may, cause, life, threatening, hypotension, type, i, anaphylaxis, type, ii, or, pulmonary, hypertension, type, iii, patients, with, prior, exposure, to, protamine, such, as, those, who, have, had, a, previous, vasectomy, protamine, is, contained, in, sperm, or, diabetics, protamine, is, contained, in, neutral, protamine, hagedorn, nph, insulin, formulations, are, at, an, increased, risk, of, type, ii, protamine, reactions, due, to, cross, sensitivity, because, protamine, is, a, fast, acting, drug, it, is, typically, given, slowly, to, allow, for, monitoring, of, possible, reactions, the, first, step, in, management, of, a, protamine, reaction, is, to, immediately, stop, the, protamine, infusion, corticosteroids, are, used, for, all, types, of, protamine, reactions, chlorphenamine, is, used, for, type, ii, anaphylactic, reactions, for, type, iii, reactions, heparin, is, redosed, and, the, patient, may, need, to, go, back, on, bypass, cpb, may, contribute, to, immediate, cognitive, decline, the, heart, lung, blood, circulation, system, and, the, connection, surgery, itself, release, a, variety, of, debris, into, the, bloodstream, including, bits, of, blood, cells, tubing, and, plaque, for, example, when, surgeons, clamp, and, connect, the, aorta, to, tubing, resulting, emboli, may, block, blood, flow, and, cause, mini, strokes, other, heart, surgery, factors, related, to, mental, damage, may, be, events, of, hypoxia, high, or, low, body, temperature, abnormal, blood, pressure, irregular, heart, rhythms, and, fever, after, surgery, cardiopulmonary, bypass, devices, consist, of, two, main, functional, units, the, pump, and, the, oxygenator, these, units, remove, oxygen, depleted, blood, from, a, patient, s, body, and, replace, it, with, oxygen, rich, blood, through, a, series, of, tubes, or, hoses, additionally, a, heat, exchanger, is, used, to, control, body, temperature, by, heating, or, cooling, the, blood, in, the, circuit, all, components, of, the, circuit, are, coated, internally, by, heparin, or, another, anticoagulant, to, prevent, clotting, within, the, circuit, the, components, of, the, cpb, circuit, are, interconnected, by, a, series, of, tubes, made, of, silicone, rubber, or, pvc, many, cpb, circuits, now, employ, a, centrifugal, pump, for, the, maintenance, and, control, of, blood, flow, during, cpb, by, altering, the, speed, of, revolution, rpm, of, the, pump, head, blood, flow, is, produced, by, centrifugal, force, this, type, of, pumping, action, is, considered, to, be, superior, to, the, roller, pump, because, it, is, thought, to, prevent, over, pressurization, clamping, or, kinking, of, lines, and, makes, less, damage, to, blood, products, hemolysis, etc, the, pump, console, usually, comprises, several, rotating, motor, driven, pumps, that, peristaltically, massage, the, tubing, this, action, gently, propels, the, blood, through, the, tubing, this, is, commonly, referred, to, as, a, roller, pump, or, peristaltic, pump, the, pumps, are, more, affordable, than, their, centrifugal, counterparts, but, are, susceptible, to, over, pressurization, if, the, lines, become, clamped, or, kinked, they, are, also, more, likely, to, cause, a, massive, air, embolism, and, require, constant, close, supervision, by, the, perfusionist, the, oxygenator, is, designed, to, add, oxygen, to, infused, blood, and, remove, some, carbon, dioxide, from, the, venous, blood, because, hypothermia, is, frequently, used, in, cpb, to, reduce, metabolic, demands, heat, exchangers, are, implemented, to, warm, and, cool, blood, within, the, circuit, heating, and, cooling, is, accomplished, by, passing, the, line, through, a, warm, or, ice, water, bath, and, a, separate, heat, exchanger, is, required, for, the, cardioplegia, line, multiple, cannulae, are, sewn, into, the, patient, s, body, in, a, variety, of, locations, depending, on, the, type, of, surgery, a, venous, cannula, removes, oxygen, depleted, venous, blood, from, a, patient, s, body, and, an, arterial, cannula, infuses, oxygen, rich, blood, into, the, arterial, system, the, main, determinants, of, cannula, size, selection, is, determined, by, the, patient, s, size, and, weight, anticipated, flow, rate, and, the, size, of, the, vessel, being, cannulated, a, cardioplegia, cannula, delivers, a, cardioplegia, solution, to, cause, the, heart, to, stop, beating, some, commonly, used, cannulation, sites, cardioplegia, is, a, fluid, solution, used, to, protect, the, heart, during, cpb, it, is, delivered, via, a, cannula, to, the, opening, of, the, coronary, arteries, usually, by, way, of, the, aortic, root, and, or, to, the, cardiac, veins, by, way, of, the, coronary, sinus, these, delivery, methods, are, referred, to, antegrade, or, retrograde, respectively, cardioplegia, solution, protects, the, heart, by, arresting, or, stopping, the, heart, this, then, decreases, the, heart, s, metabolic, demand, there, are, multiple, types, of, cardioplegia, solutions, but, most, work, by, inhibiting, fast, sodium, currents, in, the, heart, which, prevent, conduction, of, the, action, potential, other, types, of, solutions, act, by, inhibiting, calcium, s, actions, on, myocytes, cpb, requires, significant, forethought, before, surgery, in, particular, the, cannulation, cooling, and, cardio, protective, strategies, must, be, coordinated, between, the, surgeon, anesthesiologist, perfusionist, and, nursing, staff, the, cannulation, strategy, varies, on, several, operation, specific, and, patient, specific, details, nonetheless, a, surgeon, will, place, a, cannula, in, the, right, atrium, vena, cava, or, femoral, vein, to, withdraw, blood, from, the, body, the, cannula, used, to, return, oxygenated, blood, is, usually, inserted, in, the, ascending, aorta, but, there, is, a, possibility, that, it, is, inserted, in, the, femoral, artery, axillary, artery, or, brachiocephalic, artery, according, to, the, demand, of, the, surgery, after, the, cannula, is, inserted, venous, blood, is, drained, from, the, body, by, the, cannula, into, a, reservoir, this, blood, is, then, filtered, cooled, or, warmed, and, oxygenated, before, it, returns, to, the, body, through, a, mechanical, pump, a, cpb, circuit, must, be, primed, with, fluid, and, all, air, expunged, from, the, arterial, line, cannula, before, connection, to, the, patient, the, circuit, is, primed, with, a, crystalloid, solution, and, sometimes, blood, products, are, also, added, prior, to, cannulation, typically, after, opening, the, pericardium, when, using, central, cannulation, heparin, or, another, anticoagulant, is, administered, until, the, activated, clotting, time, is, above, 480, seconds, the, arterial, cannulation, site, is, inspected, for, calcification, or, other, disease, preoperative, imaging, or, an, ultrasound, probe, may, be, used, to, help, identify, aortic, calcifications, that, could, potentially, become, dislodged, and, cause, an, occlusion, or, stroke, once, the, cannulation, site, has, been, deemed, safe, two, concentric, diamond, shaped, pursestring, sutures, are, placed, in, the, distal, ascending, aorta, a, stab, incision, with, a, scalpel, is, made, within, the, pursestrings, and, the, arterial, cannula, is, passed, through, the, incision, it, is, important, the, cannula, is, passed, perpendicular, to, the, aorta, to, avoid, creating, an, aortic, dissection, the, pursestrings, sutures, are, cinched, around, the, cannula, using, a, tourniquet, and, secured, to, the, cannula, at, this, point, the, perfusionist, advances, the, arterial, line, of, the, cpb, circuit, and, the, surgeon, connects, the, arterial, line, coming, from, the, patient, to, the, arterial, line, coming, from, the, cpb, machine, care, must, be, taken, to, ensure, no, air, is, in, the, circuit, when, the, two, are, connected, or, else, the, patient, could, develop, an, air, embolism, other, sites, for, arterial, cannulation, include, the, axillary, artery, brachiocephalic, artery, or, femoral, artery, aside, from, the, differences, in, location, venous, cannulation, is, performed, similarly, to, arterial, cannulation, since, calcification, of, the, venous, system, is, less, common, the, inspection, or, use, of, an, ultrasound, for, calcification, at, the, cannulation, sites, is, unnecessary, also, because, the, venous, system, is, under, much, less, pressure, than, the, arterial, system, only, a, single, suture, is, required, to, hold, the, cannula, in, place, if, only, a, single, cannula, is, to, be, used, dual, stage, cannulation, it, is, passed, through, the, right, atrial, appendage, through, the, tricuspid, valve, and, into, the, inferior, vena, cava, if, two, cannula, are, required, single, stage, cannulation, the, first, one, is, typically, passed, through, the, superior, vena, cava, and, the, second, through, the, inferior, vena, cava, the, femoral, vein, may, also, be, cannulated, in, select, patients, if, the, heart, must, be, stopped, for, the, operation, cardioplegia, cannulas, are, also, required, antegrade, cardioplegia, forward, flowing, through, the, heart, s, arteries, retrograde, cardioplegia, backwards, flowing, through, the, heart, s, veins, or, both, types, may, be, used, depending, on, the, operation, and, surgeon, preference, for, antegrade, cardioplegia, a, small, incision, is, made, in, the, aorta, proximal, to, the, arterial, cannulation, site, between, the, heart, and, arterial, cannulation, site, and, the, cannula, is, placed, through, this, to, deliver, cardioplegia, to, the, coronary, arteries, for, retrograde, cardioplegia, an, incision, is, made, on, the, posterior, back, surface, of, the, heart, through, the, right, ventricle, the, cannula, is, placed, in, this, incision, passed, through, the, tricuspid, valve, and, into, the, coronary, sinus, the, cardioplegia, lines, are, connected, to, the, cpb, machine, at, this, point, the, patient, is, ready, to, go, on, bypass, blood, from, the, venous, cannula, s, enters, the, cpb, machine, by, gravity, where, it, is, oxygenated, and, cooled, if, necessary, before, returning, to, the, body, through, the, arterial, cannula, cardioplegia, can, now, be, administered, to, stop, the, heart, and, a, cross, clamp, is, placed, across, the, aorta, between, the, arterial, cannula, and, cardioplegia, cannula, to, prevent, the, arterial, blood, from, flowing, backwards, into, the, heart, setting, appropriate, blood, pressure, targets, to, maintain, the, health, and, function, of, the, organs, including, the, brain, and, kidney, are, important, considerations, once, the, patient, is, ready, to, come, off, of, bypass, support, the, cross, clamp, and, cannulas, are, removed, and, protamine, sulfate, is, administered, to, reverse, the, anticoagulative, effects, of, heparin, the, austrian, german, physiologist, maximilian, von, frey, constructed, an, early, prototype, of, a, heart, lung, machine, in, 1885, this, was, conducted, at, carl, ludwig, s, physiological, institute, of, the, university, of, leipzig, however, such, machines, were, not, feasible, before, the, discovery, of, heparin, in, 1916, which, prevents, blood, coagulation, the, soviet, scientist, sergei, brukhonenko, developed, a, heart, lung, machine, for, total, body, perfusion, in, 1926, named, the, autojektor, which, was, used, in, experiments, with, dogs, some, of, which, were, showcased, in, the, 1940, film, experiments, in, the, revival, of, organisms, a, team, of, scientists, at, the, university, of, birmingham, including, eric, charles, a, chemical, engineer, were, among, the, pioneers, of, this, technology, for, four, years, work, was, undertaken, to, improve, the, machine, and, on, april, 5, 1951, dr, clarence, dennis, led, the, team, at, the, university, of, minnesota, medical, center, that, conducted, the, first, human, operation, involving, open, cardiotomy, with, temporary, mechanical, takeover, of, both, heart, and, lung, functions, the, patient, did, not, survive, due, to, an, unexpected, complex, congenital, heart, defect, but, the, machine, had, proved, to, be, workable, one, member, of, the, team, was, dr, russell, m, nelson, who, later, became, president, of, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, and, he, performed, the, first, open, heart, surgery, in, utah, the, third, carried, out, in, that, year, in, november, 1951, which, was, successful, the, first, successful, mechanical, support, of, left, ventricular, function, was, performed, on, july, 3, 1952, by, forest, dewey, dodrill, using, a, machine, co, developed, with, general, motors, the, dodrill, gmr, the, machine, was, later, used, to, support, the, right, ventricular, function, the, first, successful, open, heart, procedure, on, a, human, utilizing, the, heart, lung, machine, was, performed, by, john, gibbon, and, frank, f, allbritten, jr, on, may, 6, 1953, at, thomas, jefferson, university, hospital, in, philadelphia, gibbon, s, machine, was, further, developed, into, a, reliable, instrument, by, a, surgical, team, led, by, john, w, kirklin, at, the, mayo, clinic, in, rochester, minnesota, in, the, mid, 1950s, the, oxygenator, was, first, conceptualized, in, the, 17th, century, by, robert, hooke, and, developed, into, practical, extracorporeal, oxygenators, by, french, and, german, experimental, physiologists, in, the, 19th, century, bubble, oxygenators, have, no, intervening, barrier, between, blood, and, oxygen, these, are, called, direct, contact, oxygenators, membrane, oxygenators, introduce, a, gas, permeable, membrane, between, blood, and, oxygen, that, decreases, the, blood, trauma, of, direct, contact, oxygenators, much, work, since, the, 1960s, focused, on, overcoming, the, gas, exchange, handicap, of, the, membrane, barrier, leading, to, the, development, of, high, performance, microporous, hollow, fibre, oxygenators, that, eventually, replaced, direct, contact, oxygenators, in, cardiac, theatres, in, 1983, ken, litzie, patented, a, closed, emergency, heart, bypass, system, which, reduced, circuit, and, component, complexity, this, device, improved, patient, survival, after, cardiac, arrest, because, it, could, be, rapidly, deployed, in, non, surgical, settings
