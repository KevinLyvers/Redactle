a, bomb, is, an, explosive, weapon, that, uses, the, exothermic, reaction, of, an, explosive, material, to, provide, an, extremely, sudden, and, violent, release, of, energy, detonations, inflict, damage, principally, through, ground, and, atmosphere, transmitted, mechanical, stress, the, impact, and, penetration, of, pressure, driven, projectiles, pressure, damage, and, explosion, generated, effects, bombs, have, been, utilized, since, the, 11th, century, starting, in, east, asia, the, term, bomb, is, not, usually, applied, to, explosive, devices, used, for, civilian, purposes, such, as, construction, or, mining, although, the, people, using, the, devices, may, sometimes, refer, to, them, as, a, bomb, the, military, use, of, the, term, bomb, or, more, specifically, aerial, bomb, action, typically, refers, to, airdropped, unpowered, explosive, weapons, most, commonly, used, by, air, forces, and, naval, aviation, other, military, explosive, weapons, not, classified, as, bombs, include, shells, depth, charges, used, in, water, or, land, mines, in, unconventional, warfare, other, names, can, refer, to, a, range, of, offensive, weaponry, for, instance, in, recent, asymmetric, conflicts, homemade, bombs, called, improvised, explosive, devices, ieds, have, been, employed, by, irregular, forces, to, great, effectiveness, the, word, comes, from, the, latin, bombus, which, in, turn, comes, from, the, greek, romanized, bombos, an, onomatopoetic, term, meaning, booming, buzzing, gunpowder, bombs, had, been, mentioned, since, the, 11th, century, in, 1000, ad, a, soldier, by, the, name, of, tang, fu, demonstrated, a, design, of, gunpowder, pots, a, proto, bomb, which, spews, fire, and, gunpowder, caltrops, for, which, he, was, richly, rewarded, in, the, same, year, xu, dong, wrote, that, trebuchets, used, bombs, that, were, like, flying, fire, suggesting, that, they, were, incendiaries, in, the, military, text, wujing, zongyao, of, 1044, bombs, such, as, the, ten, thousand, fire, flying, sand, magic, bomb, burning, heaven, fierce, fire, unstoppable, bomb, and, thunderclap, bomb, pilipao, were, mentioned, however, these, were, soft, shell, bombs, and, did, not, use, metal, casings, bombs, made, of, cast, iron, shells, packed, with, explosive, gunpowder, date, to, 13th, century, china, explosive, bombs, were, used, in, east, asia, in, 1221, by, a, jurchen, jin, army, against, a, chinese, song, city, the, term, for, this, explosive, bomb, seems, to, have, been, coined, the, thunder, crash, bomb, during, a, jin, dynasty, 1115, 1234, naval, battle, in, 1231, against, the, mongols, the, history, of, jin, compiled, by, 1345, states, that, in, 1232, as, the, mongol, general, subutai, 1176, 1248, descended, on, the, jin, stronghold, of, kaifeng, the, defenders, had, a, thunder, crash, bomb, which, consisted, of, gunpowder, put, into, an, iron, container, then, when, the, fuse, was, lit, and, the, projectile, shot, off, there, was, a, great, explosion, the, noise, whereof, was, like, thunder, audible, for, more, than, thirty, miles, and, the, vegetation, was, scorched, and, blasted, by, the, heat, over, an, area, of, more, than, half, a, mou, when, hit, even, iron, armour, was, quite, pierced, through, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, official, li, zengbo, wrote, in, 1257, that, arsenals, should, have, several, hundred, thousand, iron, bomb, shells, available, and, that, when, he, was, in, jingzhou, about, one, to, two, thousand, were, produced, each, month, for, dispatch, of, ten, to, twenty, thousand, at, a, time, to, xiangyang, and, yingzhou, the, ming, dynasty, text, huolongjing, describes, the, use, of, poisonous, gunpowder, bombs, including, the, wind, and, dust, bomb, during, the, mongol, invasions, of, japan, the, mongols, used, the, explosive, thunder, crash, bombs, against, the, japanese, archaeological, evidence, of, the, thunder, crash, bombs, has, been, discovered, in, an, underwater, shipwreck, off, the, shore, of, japan, by, the, kyushu, okinawa, society, for, underwater, archaeology, x, rays, by, japanese, scientists, of, the, excavated, shells, confirmed, that, they, contained, gunpowder, explosive, shock, waves, can, cause, situations, such, as, body, displacement, i, e, people, being, thrown, through, the, air, dismemberment, internal, bleeding, and, ruptured, eardrums, shock, waves, produced, by, explosive, events, have, two, distinct, components, the, positive, and, negative, wave, the, positive, wave, shoves, outward, from, the, point, of, detonation, followed, by, the, trailing, vacuum, space, sucking, back, towards, the, point, of, origin, as, the, shock, bubble, collapses, the, greatest, defense, against, shock, injuries, is, distance, from, the, source, of, shock, as, a, point, of, reference, the, overpressure, at, the, oklahoma, city, bombing, was, estimated, in, the, range, of, 28, mpa, a, thermal, wave, is, created, by, the, sudden, release, of, heat, caused, by, an, explosion, military, bomb, tests, have, documented, temperatures, of, up, to, 2, 480, c, 4, 500, f, while, capable, of, inflicting, severe, to, catastrophic, burns, and, causing, secondary, fires, thermal, wave, effects, are, considered, very, limited, in, range, compared, to, shock, and, fragmentation, this, rule, has, been, challenged, however, by, military, development, of, thermobaric, weapons, which, employ, a, combination, of, negative, shock, wave, effects, and, extreme, temperature, to, incinerate, objects, within, the, blast, radius, fragmentation, is, produced, by, the, acceleration, of, shattered, pieces, of, bomb, casing, and, adjacent, physical, objects, the, use, of, fragmentation, in, bombs, dates, to, the, 14th, century, and, appears, in, the, ming, dynasty, text, huolongjing, the, fragmentation, bombs, were, filled, with, iron, pellets, and, pieces, of, broken, porcelain, once, the, bomb, explodes, the, resulting, fragments, are, capable, of, piercing, the, skin, and, blinding, enemy, soldiers, while, conventionally, viewed, as, small, metal, shards, moving, at, super, supersonic, and, hypersonic, speeds, fragmentation, can, occur, in, epic, proportions, and, travel, for, extensive, distances, when, the, ss, grandcamp, exploded, in, the, texas, city, disaster, on, april, 16, 1947, one, fragment, of, that, blast, was, a, two, ton, anchor, which, was, hurled, nearly, two, miles, inland, to, embed, itself, in, the, parking, lot, of, the, pan, american, refinery, to, people, who, are, close, to, a, blast, incident, such, as, bomb, disposal, technicians, soldiers, wearing, body, armor, deminers, or, individuals, wearing, little, to, no, protection, there, are, four, types, of, blast, effects, on, the, human, body, overpressure, shock, fragmentation, impact, and, heat, overpressure, refers, to, the, sudden, and, drastic, rise, in, ambient, pressure, that, can, damage, the, internal, organs, possibly, leading, to, permanent, damage, or, death, fragmentation, can, also, include, sand, debris, and, vegetation, from, the, area, surrounding, the, blast, source, this, is, very, common, in, anti, personnel, mine, blasts, the, projection, of, materials, poses, a, potentially, lethal, threat, caused, by, cuts, in, soft, tissues, as, well, as, infections, and, injuries, to, the, internal, organs, when, the, overpressure, wave, impacts, the, body, it, can, induce, violent, levels, of, blast, induced, acceleration, resulting, injuries, may, range, from, minor, to, unsurvivable, immediately, following, this, initial, acceleration, deceleration, injuries, can, occur, when, a, person, impacts, directly, against, a, rigid, surface, or, obstacle, after, being, set, in, motion, by, the, force, of, the, blast, finally, injury, and, fatality, can, result, from, the, explosive, fireball, as, well, as, incendiary, agents, projected, onto, the, body, personal, protective, equipment, such, as, a, bomb, suit, or, demining, ensemble, as, well, as, helmets, visors, and, foot, protection, can, dramatically, reduce, the, four, effects, depending, upon, the, charge, proximity, and, other, variables, experts, commonly, distinguish, between, civilian, and, military, bombs, the, latter, are, almost, always, mass, produced, weapons, developed, and, constructed, to, a, standard, design, out, of, standard, components, and, intended, to, be, deployed, in, a, standard, explosive, device, ieds, are, divided, into, three, basic, categories, by, basic, size, and, delivery, type, 76, ieds, are, hand, carried, parcel, or, suitcase, bombs, type, 80, are, suicide, vests, worn, by, a, bomber, and, type, 3, devices, are, vehicles, laden, with, explosives, to, act, as, large, scale, stationary, or, self, propelled, bombs, also, known, as, vbied, vehicle, borne, ieds, improvised, explosive, materials, are, typically, unstable, and, subject, to, spontaneous, unintentional, detonation, triggered, by, a, wide, range, of, environmental, effects, ranging, from, impact, and, friction, to, electrostatic, shock, even, subtle, motion, change, in, temperature, or, the, nearby, use, of, cellphones, or, radios, can, trigger, an, unstable, or, remote, controlled, device, any, interaction, with, explosive, materials, or, devices, by, unqualified, personnel, should, be, considered, a, grave, and, immediate, risk, of, death, or, dire, injury, the, safest, response, to, finding, an, object, believed, to, be, an, explosive, device, is, to, get, as, far, away, from, it, as, possible, atomic, bombs, are, based, on, the, theory, of, nuclear, fission, that, when, a, large, atom, splits, it, releases, a, massive, amount, of, energy, thermonuclear, weapons, colloquially, known, as, hydrogen, bombs, use, the, energy, from, an, initial, fission, explosion, to, create, an, even, more, powerful, fusion, explosion, the, term, dirty, bomb, refers, to, a, specialized, device, that, relies, on, a, comparatively, low, explosive, yield, to, scatter, harmful, material, over, a, wide, area, most, commonly, associated, with, radiological, or, chemical, materials, dirty, bombs, seek, to, kill, or, injure, and, then, to, deny, access, to, a, contaminated, area, until, a, thorough, clean, up, can, be, accomplished, in, the, case, of, urban, settings, this, clean, up, may, take, extensive, time, rendering, the, contaminated, zone, virtually, uninhabitable, in, the, interim, the, power, of, large, bombs, is, typically, measured, in, kilotons, kt, or, megatons, of, tnt, mt, the, most, powerful, bombs, ever, used, in, combat, were, the, two, atomic, bombs, dropped, by, the, united, states, to, attack, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, and, the, most, powerful, ever, tested, was, the, tsar, bomba, the, most, powerful, non, nuclear, bomb, is, russian, father, of, all, bombs, officially, aviation, thermobaric, bomb, of, increased, power, atbip, followed, by, the, united, states, air, force, s, moab, officially, massive, ordnance, air, blast, or, more, commonly, known, as, the, mother, of, all, bombs, below, is, a, list, of, five, different, types, of, bombs, based, on, the, fundamental, explosive, mechanism, they, employ, relatively, small, explosions, can, be, produced, by, pressurizing, a, container, until, catastrophic, failure, such, as, with, a, dry, ice, bomb, technically, devices, that, create, explosions, of, this, type, can, not, be, classified, as, bombs, by, the, definition, presented, at, the, top, of, this, article, however, the, explosions, created, by, these, devices, can, cause, property, damage, injury, or, death, flammable, liquids, gasses, and, gas, mixtures, dispersed, in, these, explosions, may, also, ignite, if, exposed, to, a, spark, or, flame, the, simplest, and, oldest, bombs, store, energy, in, the, form, of, a, low, explosive, black, powder, is, an, example, of, a, low, explosive, low, explosives, typically, consist, of, a, mixture, of, an, oxidizing, salt, such, as, potassium, nitrate, saltpeter, with, solid, fuel, such, as, charcoal, or, aluminium, powder, these, compositions, deflagrate, upon, ignition, producing, hot, gas, under, normal, circumstances, this, deflagration, occurs, too, slowly, to, produce, a, significant, pressure, wave, low, explosives, therefore, must, generally, be, used, in, large, quantities, or, confined, in, a, container, with, a, high, burst, pressure, to, be, useful, as, a, bomb, a, high, explosive, bomb, is, one, that, employs, a, process, called, detonation, to, rapidly, go, from, an, initially, high, energy, molecule, to, a, very, low, energy, molecule, detonation, is, distinct, from, deflagration, in, that, the, chemical, reaction, propagates, faster, than, the, speed, of, sound, often, many, times, faster, in, an, intense, shock, wave, therefore, the, pressure, wave, produced, by, a, high, explosive, is, not, significantly, increased, by, confinement, as, detonation, occurs, so, quickly, that, the, resulting, plasma, does, not, expand, much, before, all, the, explosive, material, has, reacted, this, has, led, to, the, development, of, plastic, explosive, a, casing, is, still, employed, in, some, high, explosive, bombs, but, with, the, purpose, of, fragmentation, most, high, explosive, bombs, consist, of, an, insensitive, secondary, explosive, that, must, be, detonated, with, a, blasting, cap, containing, a, more, sensitive, primary, explosive, a, thermobaric, bomb, is, a, type, of, explosive, that, utilizes, oxygen, from, the, surrounding, air, to, generate, an, intense, high, temperature, explosion, and, in, practice, the, blast, wave, typically, produced, by, such, a, weapon, is, of, a, significantly, longer, duration, than, that, produced, by, a, conventional, condensed, explosive, the, fuel, air, bomb, is, one, of, the, best, known, types, of, thermobaric, weapons, nuclear, fission, type, atomic, bombs, utilize, the, energy, present, in, very, heavy, atomic, nuclei, such, as, u, 235, or, pu, 239, in, order, to, release, this, energy, rapidly, a, certain, amount, of, the, fissile, material, must, be, very, rapidly, consolidated, while, being, exposed, to, a, neutron, source, if, consolidation, occurs, slowly, repulsive, forces, drive, the, material, apart, before, a, significant, explosion, can, occur, under, the, right, circumstances, rapid, consolidation, can, provoke, a, chain, reaction, that, can, proliferate, and, intensify, by, many, orders, of, magnitude, within, microseconds, the, energy, released, by, a, nuclear, fission, bomb, may, be, tens, of, thousands, of, times, greater, than, a, chemical, bomb, of, the, same, mass, a, thermonuclear, weapon, is, a, type, of, nuclear, bomb, that, releases, energy, through, the, combination, of, fission, and, fusion, of, the, light, atomic, nuclei, of, deuterium, and, tritium, with, this, type, of, bomb, a, thermonuclear, detonation, is, triggered, by, the, detonation, of, a, fission, type, nuclear, bomb, contained, within, a, material, containing, high, concentrations, of, deuterium, and, tritium, weapon, yield, is, typically, increased, with, a, tamper, that, increases, the, duration, and, intensity, of, the, reaction, through, inertial, confinement, and, neutron, reflection, nuclear, fusion, bombs, can, have, arbitrarily, high, yields, making, them, hundreds, or, thousands, of, times, more, powerful, than, nuclear, fission, a, pure, fusion, weapon, is, a, hypothetical, nuclear, weapon, that, does, not, require, a, primary, fission, stage, to, start, a, fusion, reaction, antimatter, bombs, can, theoretically, be, constructed, but, antimatter, is, very, costly, to, produce, and, hard, to, store, safely, the, first, air, dropped, bombs, were, used, by, the, austrians, in, the, 1849, siege, of, venice, two, hundred, unmanned, balloons, carried, small, bombs, although, few, bombs, actually, hit, the, city, the, first, bombing, from, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, took, place, in, 1911, when, the, italians, dropped, bombs, by, hand, on, the, turkish, lines, in, what, is, now, libya, during, the, italo, turkish, war, the, first, large, scale, dropping, of, bombs, took, place, during, world, war, i, starting, in, 1915, with, the, german, zeppelin, airship, raids, on, london, england, and, the, same, war, saw, the, invention, of, the, first, heavy, bombers, one, zeppelin, raid, on, 8, september, 1915, dropped, 4, 000, lb, 1, 800, kg, of, high, explosives, and, incendiary, bombs, including, one, bomb, that, weighed, 600, lb, 270, kg, during, world, war, ii, bombing, became, a, major, military, feature, and, a, number, of, novel, delivery, methods, were, introduced, these, included, barnes, wallis, s, bouncing, bomb, designed, to, bounce, across, water, avoiding, torpedo, nets, and, other, underwater, defenses, until, it, reached, a, dam, ship, or, other, destination, where, it, would, sink, and, explode, by, the, end, of, the, war, planes, such, as, the, allied, forces, avro, lancaster, were, delivering, with, 50, yd, 46, m, accuracy, from, 20, 000, ft, 6, 100, m, ten, ton, earthquake, bombs, also, invented, by, barnes, wallis, named, grand, slam, which, unusually, for, the, time, were, delivered, from, high, altitude, in, order, to, gain, high, speed, and, would, upon, impact, penetrate, and, explode, deep, underground, camouflet, causing, massive, caverns, or, craters, and, affecting, targets, too, large, or, difficult, to, be, affected, by, other, types, of, bomb, modern, military, bomber, aircraft, are, designed, around, a, large, capacity, internal, bomb, bay, while, fighter, bombers, usually, carry, bombs, externally, on, pylons, or, bomb, racks, or, on, multiple, ejection, racks, which, enable, mounting, several, bombs, on, a, single, pylon, some, bombs, are, equipped, with, a, parachute, such, as, the, world, war, ii, parafrag, an, 11, kg, 24, lb, fragmentation, bomb, the, vietnam, war, era, daisy, cutters, and, the, bomblets, of, some, modern, cluster, bombs, parachutes, slow, the, bomb, s, descent, giving, the, dropping, aircraft, time, to, get, to, a, safe, distance, from, the, explosion, this, is, especially, important, with, air, burst, nuclear, weapons, especially, those, dropped, from, slower, aircraft, or, with, very, high, yields, and, in, situations, where, the, aircraft, releases, a, bomb, at, low, altitude, a, number, of, modern, bombs, are, also, precision, guided, munitions, and, may, be, guided, after, they, leave, an, aircraft, by, remote, control, or, by, autonomous, guidance, aircraft, may, also, deliver, bombs, in, the, form, of, warheads, on, guided, missiles, such, as, long, range, cruise, missiles, which, can, also, be, launched, from, warships, a, hand, grenade, is, delivered, by, being, thrown, grenades, can, also, be, projected, by, other, means, such, as, being, launched, from, the, muzzle, of, a, rifle, as, in, the, rifle, grenade, using, a, grenade, launcher, such, as, the, m203, or, by, attaching, a, rocket, to, the, explosive, grenade, as, in, a, rocket, propelled, grenade, rpg, a, bomb, may, also, be, positioned, in, advance, and, concealed, a, bomb, destroying, a, rail, track, just, before, a, train, arrives, will, usually, cause, the, train, to, derail, in, addition, to, the, damage, to, vehicles, and, people, a, bomb, exploding, in, a, transport, network, often, damages, and, is, sometimes, mainly, intended, to, damage, the, network, itself, this, applies, to, railways, bridges, runways, and, ports, and, to, a, lesser, extent, depending, on, circumstances, to, roads, in, the, case, of, suicide, bombing, the, bomb, is, often, carried, by, the, attacker, on, their, body, or, in, a, vehicle, driven, to, the, target, the, blue, peacock, nuclear, mines, which, were, also, termed, bombs, were, planned, to, be, positioned, during, wartime, and, be, constructed, such, that, if, disturbed, they, would, explode, within, ten, seconds, the, explosion, of, a, bomb, may, be, triggered, by, a, detonator, or, a, fuse, detonators, are, triggered, by, clocks, remote, controls, like, cell, phones, or, some, kind, of, sensor, such, as, pressure, altitude, radar, vibration, or, contact, detonators, vary, in, ways, they, work, they, can, be, electrical, fire, fuze, or, blast, initiated, detonators, and, others, in, forensic, science, the, point, of, detonation, of, a, bomb, is, referred, to, as, its, blast, seat, seat, of, explosion, blast, hole, or, epicenter, depending, on, the, type, quantity, and, placement, of, explosives, the, blast, seat, may, be, either, spread, out, or, concentrated, i, e, an, explosion, crater, other, types, of, explosions, such, as, dust, or, vapor, explosions, do, not, cause, craters, or, even, have, definitive, blast, seats
