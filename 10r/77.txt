the, technology, of, computer, keyboards, includes, many, elements, many, different, keyboard, technologies, have, been, developed, for, consumer, demands, and, optimized, for, industrial, applications, the, standard, full, size, 100, computer, alphanumeric, keyboard, typically, uses, 101, to, 105, keys, keyboards, integrated, in, laptop, computers, are, typically, less, comprehensive, virtual, keyboards, which, are, mostly, accessed, via, a, touchscreen, interface, have, no, physical, switches, and, provide, artificial, audio, and, haptic, feedback, instead, this, variety, of, keyboard, can, prove, useful, as, it, is, not, limited, by, the, rigid, nature, of, physical, computer, keyboards, the, majority, of, modern, keyboards, include, a, control, processor, and, indicator, lights, to, provide, feedback, to, the, user, and, to, the, central, processor, about, what, state, the, keyboard, is, in, plug, and, play, technology, means, that, its, out, of, the, box, layout, can, be, notified, to, the, system, making, the, keyboard, immediately, ready, to, use, without, the, need, for, further, configuration, unless, the, user, so, desires, this, also, enables, manufacture, of, generic, keyboards, for, a, variety, of, language, markets, that, differ, only, in, the, symbols, engraved, on, the, keytops, a, common, membrane, design, consists, of, three, layers, the, top, and, bottom, layer, have, exposed, electrical, matrix, traces, and, the, middle, layer, is, a, spacer, to, prevent, current, from, passing, through, the, top, and, bottom, conductive, traces, passively, when, pressure, is, applied, to, the, top, membrane, it, bridges, the, top, and, bottom, conductive, contact, pads, allowing, current, to, transfer, two, of, the, most, common, types, of, membrane, keyboards, include, full, travel, rubber, dome, over, membrane, and, flat, panel, membrane, keyboards, flat, panel, membrane, keyboards, are, most, often, found, on, appliances, like, microwave, ovens, or, photocopiers, full, travel, rubber, dome, over, membrane, keyboards, are, the, most, common, keyboard, design, manufactured, today, in, these, keyboards, a, rubber, dome, sheet, is, placed, above, the, membranes, ensuring, that, the, domes, align, with, the, contact, pads, the, rubber, dome, serves, a, dual, purpose, it, acts, as, a, tactile, return, spring, and, provides, a, soft, surface, to, transfer, force, onto, the, top, membrane, to, bridge, the, connection, between, the, two, contact, pads, the, rubber, dome, must, be, fully, depressed, rubber, dome, over, membrane, keyboards, became, very, popular, with, computer, manufacturers, as, they, sought, to, reduce, costs, while, pc, prices, declined, a, common, compact, variant, of, rubber, dome, over, membrane, is, the, scissor, switch, based, on, the, scissors, mechanism, due, to, the, requirement, of, many, notebooks, to, be, slim, they, require, the, keyboards, to, be, low, profile, therefore, this, technology, is, most, commonly, featured, on, notebooks, the, keys, are, attached, to, the, keyboard, via, two, plastic, pieces, that, interlock, in, a, scissor, like, fashion, and, snap, to, the, keyboard, and, the, keycap, these, keyboards, are, generally, quiet, and, the, keys, require, little, force, to, press, scissor, switch, keyboards, are, typically, slightly, more, expensive, they, are, harder, to, clean, due, to, the, limited, movement, of, the, keys, and, their, multiple, attachment, points, but, also, less, likely, to, get, debris, in, them, as, the, gaps, between, the, keys, are, often, smaller, as, there, is, no, need, for, extra, room, to, allow, for, the, wiggle, in, the, key, as, typically, found, on, a, membrane, keyboard, flat, panel, membrane, keyboards, are, often, used, in, harsh, environments, where, water, or, leak, proofing, is, desirable, they, can, have, non, tactile, polydome, tactile, and, metal, dome, tactile, keys, polydome, tactile, membrane, switches, use, polyester, or, pet, and, is, formed, to, create, a, stiff, plastic, dome, when, the, stiff, polydome, is, pressed, the, conductive, ink, on, the, back, of, the, polydome, connects, with, the, bottom, layer, of, the, circuit, metal, dome, membrane, switches, are, made, of, stainless, steel, and, offer, enhanced, durability, and, reliability, and, can, feature, custom, dome, designs, non, tactile, flat, panel, membrane, keyboards, have, little, to, no, keypress, feel, and, often, issue, a, beep, or, flash, of, light, on, actuation, although, this, keyboard, design, was, commonly, used, in, the, early, days, of, the, personal, computer, on, the, sinclair, zx80, zx81, and, atari, 400, they, have, been, supplanted, by, more, responsive, and, modern, designs, computer, keyboards, made, of, flexible, silicone, or, polyurethane, materials, can, roll, up, in, a, bundle, this, type, of, keyboard, can, take, advantage, of, the, thin, flexible, plastic, membranes, but, still, pose, the, risk, of, damage, when, they, are, completely, sealed, in, rubber, they, are, water, resistant, roll, up, keyboards, provide, relatively, little, tactile, feedback, because, these, keyboards, are, typically, made, of, silicone, they, unfavorably, tend, to, attract, dirt, dust, and, hair, keyboard, which, have, metal, contact, switches, typically, use, discrete, modules, for, each, key, this, type, of, switch, are, usually, composed, of, a, housing, a, spring, and, a, slider, and, sometimes, other, parts, such, as, a, separate, tactile, leaf, or, clickbar, at, rest, the, metal, contacts, inside, of, the, switch, are, held, apart, as, the, switch, is, pressed, down, the, contacts, are, held, together, to, conduct, current, for, actuation, many, switch, designs, use, gold, for, contact, material, to, prolong, the, lifetime, of, the, switch, by, preventing, switch, failure, from, oxidization, most, designs, use, a, metal, leaf, where, the, movable, contact, is, a, leaf, spring, a, major, producer, of, discrete, metal, contact, switches, is, cherry, who, has, manufactured, the, cherry, mx, family, of, switches, since, the, 1980s, cherry, s, color, coding, system, of, categorizing, switches, has, been, imitated, by, other, switch, manufacturers, such, as, gateron, and, kailh, among, many, others, keyboards, which, utilize, this, technology, are, commonly, referred, to, as, mechanical, keyboards, but, there, isn, t, a, universally, agreed, upon, clear, cut, definition, for, this, term, hot, swappable, keyboards, are, keyboards, in, which, switches, can, be, pulled, out, and, replaced, without, requiring, the, typical, solder, connection, instead, of, the, switch, pins, being, directly, soldered, to, the, keyboard, s, pcb, hot, swap, sockets, are, instead, soldered, on, hot, swap, sockets, can, allow, users, to, change, different, switches, out, of, the, keyboard, without, having, the, tools, or, knowledge, required, to, solder, the, reed, module, in, a, reed, switch, consists, of, two, metal, contacts, inside, of, a, glass, bubble, usually, sealed, with, some, inert, gas, like, nitrogen, to, help, prevent, particle, build, up, the, slider, in, the, housing, pushes, a, magnet, down, in, front, of, the, reed, capsule, and, the, magnetic, field, causes, the, reed, contacts, to, become, attracted, to, each, other, and, make, contact, the, reed, switch, mechanism, was, originally, invented, in, 1936, by, w, b, ellwood, at, bell, telephone, laboratories, although, reed, switches, use, metal, leaf, contacts, they, are, considered, separate, from, all, other, forms, of, metal, contact, switch, because, the, contacts, are, operated, magnetically, instead, of, using, physical, force, from, a, slider, to, be, pressed, together, in, a, capacitive, mechanism, pressing, a, key, changes, the, capacitance, of, a, pattern, of, capacitor, pads, the, pattern, consists, of, two, d, shaped, capacitor, pads, for, each, switch, printed, on, a, printed, circuit, board, pcb, and, covered, by, a, thin, insulating, film, of, soldermask, which, acts, as, a, dielectric, for, the, most, common, foam, and, foil, implementation, of, this, technology, the, movable, part, ends, with, a, flat, foam, element, about, the, size, of, an, aspirin, tablet, finished, with, aluminum, foil, opposite, the, switch, is, a, pcb, with, the, capacitor, pads, when, the, key, is, pressed, the, foil, tightly, clings, to, the, surface, of, the, pcb, forming, a, daisy, chain, of, two, capacitors, between, contact, pads, and, itself, separated, with, a, thin, soldermask, and, thus, shorting, the, contact, pads, with, an, easily, detectable, drop, of, capacitive, reactance, between, them, usually, this, permits, a, pulse, or, pulse, train, to, be, sensed, an, advantage, of, the, capacitive, technology, is, that, the, switch, is, not, dependent, on, the, flow, of, current, through, metal, contacts, to, actuate, there, is, no, debouncing, necessary, the, sensor, tells, enough, about, the, distance, of, the, keypress, to, allow, the, user, to, adjust, the, actuation, point, key, sensitivity, this, adjustment, can, be, done, with, the, help, of, the, bundled, software, and, individually, for, each, key, if, so, implemented, a, keyboard, which, utilizes, these, abilities, include, the, realforce, rgb, ibm, s, model, f, keyboard, is, a, design, consisting, of, a, buckling, spring, over, a, capacitive, pcb, similar, to, the, later, model, m, keyboard, but, instead, used, membrane, sensing, in, place, of, a, pcb, the, topre, corporation, design, for, switches, uses, a, conical, spring, below, a, rubber, dome, the, dome, provides, resistance, while, the, spring, does, the, capacitive, action, hall, effect, keyboards, use, hall, effect, sensors, to, detect, the, movement, of, a, magnet, by, the, potential, difference, in, voltage, when, a, key, is, depressed, it, moves, a, magnet, that, is, detected, by, a, solid, state, sensor, because, they, require, no, physical, contact, for, actuation, hall, effect, keyboards, are, extremely, reliable, and, can, accept, millions, of, keystrokes, before, failing, they, are, used, for, ultra, high, reliability, applications, such, as, nuclear, power, plants, aircraft, cockpits, and, critical, industrial, environments, they, can, easily, be, made, totally, waterproof, and, can, resist, large, amounts, of, dust, and, contaminants, because, a, magnet, and, sensor, are, required, for, each, key, as, well, as, custom, control, electronics, they, are, expensive, to, manufacture, a, hall, switch, works, through, magnetic, fields, every, switch, has, a, small, magnet, fixed, inside, it, when, the, electricity, passes, through, the, main, circuit, it, creates, a, magnetic, flux, every, time, a, key, is, pressed, the, magnetic, intensity, changes, this, change, is, noticed, by, the, circuit, and, the, sensors, send, the, information, to, the, motherboard, optical, switch, technology, was, introduced, in, 1962, by, harley, e, kelchner, for, use, in, a, typewriter, machine, with, the, purpose, of, reducing, the, noise, generated, by, typewriter, keys, an, optical, keyboard, technology, utilizes, light, emitting, devices, and, photo, sensors, to, optically, detect, actuated, keys, most, commonly, the, emitters, and, sensors, are, located, at, the, perimeter, mounted, on, a, small, pcb, the, light, is, directed, from, side, to, side, of, the, keyboard, interior, and, it, can, only, be, blocked, by, the, actuated, keys, most, optical, keyboards, require, at, least, two, beams, most, commonly, a, vertical, beam, and, a, horizontal, beam, to, determine, the, actuated, key, some, optical, keyboards, use, a, special, key, structure, that, blocks, the, light, in, a, certain, pattern, allowing, only, one, beam, per, row, of, keys, most, commonly, a, horizontal, beam, the, mechanism, of, the, optical, keyboard, is, very, simple, a, light, beam, is, sent, from, the, emitter, to, the, receiving, sensor, and, the, actuated, key, blocks, reflects, refracts, or, otherwise, interacts, with, the, beam, resulting, in, an, identified, key, a, major, advantage, of, optical, switch, technology, is, that, it, is, very, resistant, to, moisture, dust, and, debris, because, there, are, no, metal, contacts, that, can, corrode, the, specialist, datahand, keyboard, uses, optical, technology, to, sense, keypresses, with, a, single, light, beam, and, sensor, per, key, the, keys, are, held, in, their, rest, position, by, magnets, when, the, magnetic, force, is, overcome, to, press, a, key, the, optical, path, is, unblocked, and, the, keypress, is, registered, a, laser, projection, device, approximately, the, size, of, a, computer, mouse, projects, the, outline, of, keyboard, keys, onto, a, flat, surface, such, as, a, table, or, desk, this, type, of, keyboard, is, portable, enough, to, be, easily, used, with, pdas, and, cellphones, and, many, models, have, retractable, cords, and, wireless, capabilities, however, this, design, is, prone, to, error, as, accidental, disruption, of, the, laser, will, generate, unwanted, keystrokes, this, type, of, keyboard, s, inherent, lack, of, tactile, feedback, makes, it, often, undesirable, the, buckling, spring, mechanism, expired, u, s, patent, 4, 118, 611, atop, the, switch, is, responsible, for, the, clicky, response, of, the, keyboard, this, mechanism, controls, a, small, hammer, that, strikes, a, capacitive, or, membrane, switch, ibm, s, model, f, keyboard, series, was, the, first, to, employ, buckling, spring, key, switches, which, used, capacitive, sensing, to, actuate, the, original, patent, was, never, employed, in, an, actual, production, keyboard, but, it, establishes, the, basic, premise, of, a, buckling, spring, the, ibm, model, m, is, a, large, family, of, computer, keyboards, created, by, ibm, that, began, in, late, 1983, when, ibm, patented, a, membrane, buckling, spring, key, switch, design, the, main, intent, of, this, design, was, to, halve, the, production, cost, of, the, model, f, the, most, well, known, full, size, model, m, is, known, officially, as, the, ibm, enhanced, keyboard, in, 1993, two, years, after, spawning, lexmark, ibm, transferred, its, keyboard, operations, to, the, daughter, company, new, model, m, keyboards, continued, to, be, manufactured, for, ibm, by, lexmark, until, 1996, when, unicomp, was, established, and, purchased, the, keyboard, patents, and, tooling, equipment, to, continue, their, production, ibm, continued, to, make, model, m, s, in, their, scotland, factory, until, 1999, when, a, key, is, pressed, it, oscillates, bounces, against, its, contacts, several, times, before, settling, when, released, it, oscillates, again, until, it, comes, to, rest, although, it, happens, on, a, scale, too, small, to, be, visible, to, the, naked, eye, it, can, be, enough, to, register, multiple, keystrokes, to, resolve, this, the, processor, in, a, keyboard, debounces, the, keystrokes, by, averaging, the, signal, over, time, to, produce, one, confirmed, keystroke, that, usually, corresponds, to, a, single, press, or, release, early, membrane, keyboards, had, limited, typing, speed, because, they, had, to, do, significant, debouncing, this, was, a, noticeable, problem, on, the, zx81, keycaps, are, used, on, full, travel, keyboards, while, modern, keycaps, are, typically, surface, printed, they, can, also, be, double, shot, molded, laser, marked, dye, sublimation, printed, engraved, or, made, of, transparent, material, with, printed, paper, inserts, there, are, also, keycaps, which, utilize, thin, shells, that, are, placed, over, key, bases, which, were, used, on, several, ibm, pc, keyboards, switches, allow, for, the, removal, and, replacement, of, keycaps, with, a, common, stem, type, almost, all, keyboards, which, utilize, keys, two, or, more, units, in, length, such, as, the, typical, space, bar, or, enter, key, use, stabilizers, various, lubricants, and, padding, techniques, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, rattle, of, components, a, modern, pc, keyboard, typically, includes, a, control, processor, and, indicator, lights, to, provide, feedback, to, the, user, about, what, state, the, keyboard, is, in, depending, on, the, sophistication, of, the, controller, s, programming, the, keyboard, may, also, offer, other, special, features, the, processor, is, usually, a, single, chip, 8048, microcontroller, variant, the, keyboard, switch, matrix, is, wired, to, its, inputs, and, it, processes, the, incoming, keystrokes, and, sends, the, results, down, a, serial, cable, the, keyboard, cord, to, a, receiver, in, the, main, computer, box, it, also, controls, the, illumination, of, the, caps, lock, num, lock, and, scroll, lock, lights, a, common, test, for, whether, the, computer, has, crashed, is, pressing, the, caps, lock, key, the, keyboard, sends, the, key, code, to, the, keyboard, driver, running, in, the, main, computer, if, the, main, computer, is, operating, it, commands, the, light, to, turn, on, all, the, other, indicator, lights, work, in, a, similar, way, the, keyboard, driver, also, tracks, the, shift, alt, and, control, state, of, the, keyboard, the, keyboard, switch, matrix, is, often, drawn, with, horizontal, wires, and, vertical, wires, in, a, grid, which, is, called, a, matrix, circuit, it, has, a, switch, at, some, or, all, intersections, much, like, a, multiplexed, display, almost, all, keyboards, have, only, the, switch, but, no, diode, at, each, intersection, which, causes, ghost, keys, and, key, jamming, when, multiple, keys, are, pressed, rollover, certain, often, more, expensive, keyboards, have, a, diode, between, each, intersection, allowing, the, keyboard, microcontroller, to, accurately, sense, any, number, of, simultaneous, keys, being, pressed, without, generating, erroneous, ghost, keys, optical, character, recognition, ocr, is, preferable, to, rekeying, for, converting, existing, text, that, is, already, written, down, but, not, in, machine, readable, format, for, example, a, linotype, composed, book, from, the, 1940s, in, other, words, to, convert, the, text, from, an, image, to, editable, text, that, is, a, string, of, character, codes, a, person, could, re, type, it, or, a, computer, could, look, at, the, image, and, deduce, what, each, character, is, ocr, technology, has, already, reached, an, impressive, state, for, example, google, book, search, and, promises, more, for, the, future, speech, recognition, converts, speech, into, machine, readable, text, that, is, a, string, of, character, codes, this, technology, has, also, reached, an, advanced, state, and, is, implemented, in, various, software, products, for, certain, uses, e, g, transcription, of, medical, or, legal, dictation, journalism, writing, essays, or, novels, speech, recognition, is, starting, to, replace, the, keyboard, however, the, lack, of, privacy, when, issuing, voice, commands, and, dictation, makes, this, kind, of, input, unsuitable, for, many, environments, pointing, devices, can, be, used, to, enter, text, or, characters, in, contexts, where, using, a, physical, keyboard, would, be, inappropriate, or, impossible, these, accessories, typically, present, characters, on, a, display, in, a, layout, that, provides, fast, access, to, the, more, frequently, used, characters, or, character, combinations, popular, examples, of, this, kind, of, input, are, graffiti, dasher, and, on, screen, virtual, keyboards, unencrypted, bluetooth, keyboards, are, known, to, be, vulnerable, to, signal, theft, for, keylogging, by, other, bluetooth, devices, in, range, microsoft, wireless, keyboards, 2011, and, earlier, are, documented, to, have, this, vulnerability, keystroke, logging, often, called, keylogging, is, a, method, of, capturing, and, recording, user, keystrokes, while, it, can, be, used, legally, to, measure, employee, activity, or, by, law, enforcement, agencies, to, investigate, suspicious, activities, it, is, also, used, by, hackers, for, illegal, or, malicious, acts, hackers, use, keyloggers, to, obtain, passwords, or, encryption, keys, keystroke, logging, can, be, achieved, by, both, hardware, and, software, means, hardware, key, loggers, are, attached, to, the, keyboard, cable, or, installed, inside, standard, keyboards, software, keyloggers, work, on, the, target, computer, s, operating, system, and, gain, unauthorized, access, to, the, hardware, hook, into, the, keyboard, with, functions, provided, by, the, os, or, use, remote, access, software, to, transmit, recorded, data, out, of, the, target, computer, to, a, remote, location, some, hackers, also, use, wireless, keylogger, sniffers, to, collect, packets, of, data, being, transferred, from, a, wireless, keyboard, and, its, receiver, and, then, they, crack, the, encryption, key, being, used, to, secure, wireless, communications, between, the, two, devices, anti, spyware, applications, are, able, to, detect, many, keyloggers, and, remove, them, responsible, vendors, of, monitoring, software, support, detection, by, anti, spyware, programs, thus, preventing, abuse, of, the, software, enabling, a, firewall, does, not, stop, keyloggers, per, se, but, can, possibly, prevent, transmission, of, the, logged, material, over, the, net, if, properly, configured, network, monitors, also, known, as, reverse, firewalls, can, be, used, to, alert, the, user, whenever, an, application, attempts, to, make, a, network, connection, this, gives, the, user, the, chance, to, prevent, the, keylogger, from, phoning, home, with, his, or, her, typed, information, automatic, form, filling, programs, can, prevent, keylogging, entirely, by, not, using, the, keyboard, at, all, most, keyloggers, can, be, fooled, by, alternating, between, typing, the, login, credentials, and, typing, characters, somewhere, else, in, the, focus, window, keyboards, are, also, known, to, emit, electromagnetic, signatures, that, can, be, detected, using, special, spying, equipment, to, reconstruct, the, keys, pressed, on, the, keyboard, neal, o, farrell, executive, director, of, the, identity, theft, council, revealed, to, informationweek, that, more, than, 25, years, ago, a, couple, of, former, spooks, showed, me, how, they, could, capture, a, user, s, atm, pin, from, a, van, parked, across, the, street, simply, by, capturing, and, decoding, the, electromagnetic, signals, generated, by, every, keystroke, o, farrell, said, they, could, even, capture, keystrokes, from, computers, in, nearby, offices, but, the, technology, wasn, t, sophisticated, enough, to, focus, in, on, any, specific, computer, the, use, of, any, keyboard, may, cause, serious, injury, such, as, carpal, tunnel, syndrome, or, other, repetitive, strain, injuries, to, the, hands, wrists, arms, neck, or, back, the, risks, of, injuries, can, be, reduced, by, taking, frequent, short, breaks, to, get, up, and, walk, around, a, couple, of, times, every, hour, users, should, also, vary, tasks, throughout, the, day, to, avoid, overuse, of, the, hands, and, wrists, when, typing, on, a, keyboard, a, person, should, keep, the, shoulders, relaxed, with, the, elbows, at, the, side, with, the, keyboard, and, mouse, positioned, so, that, reaching, is, not, necessary, the, chair, height, and, keyboard, tray, should, be, adjusted, so, that, the, wrists, are, straight, and, the, wrists, should, not, be, rested, on, sharp, table, edges, wrist, or, palm, rests, should, not, be, used, while, typing, some, adaptive, technology, ranging, from, special, keyboards, mouse, replacements, and, pen, tablet, interfaces, to, speech, recognition, software, can, reduce, the, risk, of, injury, pause, software, reminds, the, user, to, pause, frequently, switching, to, a, much, more, ergonomic, mouse, such, as, a, vertical, mouse, or, joystick, mouse, may, provide, relief, by, using, a, touchpad, or, a, stylus, pen, with, a, graphic, tablet, in, place, of, a, mouse, one, can, lessen, the, repetitive, strain, on, the, arms, and, hands
