a, missile, is, an, airborne, ranged, weapon, capable, of, self, propelled, flight, aided, usually, by, a, propellant, jet, engine, or, rocket, motor, historically, missile, referred, to, any, projectile, that, is, thrown, shot, or, propelled, towards, a, target, this, usage, is, still, recognized, today, with, any, unguided, jet, or, rocket, propelled, weapons, generally, described, as, rocket, artillery, airborne, explosive, devices, without, propulsion, are, referred, to, as, shells, if, fired, by, an, artillery, piece, and, bombs, if, dropped, by, an, aircraft, missiles, are, also, generally, guided, towards, specific, targets, termed, as, guided, missiles, or, guided, rockets, missile, systems, usually, have, five, system, components, targeting, guidance, system, flight, system, engine, and, warhead, missiles, are, primarily, classified, into, different, types, based, on, firing, source, and, target, such, as, surface, to, surface, air, to, surface, surface, to, air, and, air, to, air, missiles, rockets, were, the, precursor, to, modern, missiles, and, the, first, rockets, were, used, as, propulsion, systems, for, arrows, as, early, as, the, 10th, century, in, china, usage, of, rockets, as, weapons, before, modern, rocketry, is, attested, to, in, china, korea, india, and, europe, in, the, 18th, century, iron, cased, rockets, were, used, in, india, by, the, kingdom, of, mysore, and, maratha, empire, against, the, british, which, was, developed, into, congreve, rocket, and, used, in, the, napoleonic, wars, in, the, early, 20th, century, american, robert, goddard, and, german, hermann, oberth, developed, early, rockets, propelled, by, jet, engines, in, the, 1920s, soviet, union, developed, solid, fuel, rockets, at, the, gas, dynamics, laboratory, later, the, first, missiles, to, be, used, operationally, were, a, series, of, rocket, based, missiles, developed, by, nazi, germany, during, world, war, ii, including, the, v, 1, flying, bomb, and, v, 2, rocket, which, used, mechanical, autopilot, to, keep, the, missile, flying, along, a, pre, chosen, route, less, well, known, were, a, series, of, anti, ship, and, anti, aircraft, missiles, typically, based, on, a, simple, radio, control, command, guidance, system, directed, by, the, operator, however, these, early, systems, in, world, war, ii, were, only, built, in, small, numbers, after, world, war, ii, the, advent, of, the, cold, war, and, development, of, nuclear, weapons, necessitated, faster, accurate, and, versatile, missiles, with, longer, range, and, missile, development, was, pursued, by, multiple, countries, a, missile, is, most, often, guided, by, a, guidance, system, though, there, are, missiles, that, are, unguided, during, some, phases, of, flight, missile, guidance, refers, to, methods, of, guiding, a, missile, to, its, intended, target, effective, guidance, is, important, because, reaching, the, target, position, accurately, and, precisely, is, a, critical, factor, for, its, effectiveness, the, missile, guidance, system, accomplishes, this, by, four, steps, tracking, the, target, computing, the, directions, using, tracking, information, directing, the, computed, inputs, to, steering, control, and, steering, the, missile, by, directing, inputs, to, motors, or, flight, control, surfaces, the, guidance, system, consists, of, three, sections, launch, mid, course, and, terminal, with, same, or, different, systems, employed, across, sections, the, guidance, and, homing, systems, are, generally, classified, broadly, into, active, semi, active, and, passive, in, active, homing, systems, the, missile, carries, the, equipment, needed, to, transmit, the, radiation, needed, to, illuminate, the, target, and, receive, the, reflected, energy, once, the, homing, is, initiated, the, missile, directs, independently, towards, the, target, in, semi, active, systems, the, source, of, the, radiation, is, located, outside, the, missile, usually, in, the, launch, vehicle, which, might, be, an, aircraft, or, a, ship, and, the, missile, will, receive, the, radiation, to, direct, towards, the, target, as, the, source, is, located, outside, the, launch, vehicle, needs, to, continue, supporting, the, missile, till, it, is, guided, to, the, intended, target, in, a, passive, system, the, missile, relies, solely, on, the, information, from, the, target, the, homing, system, might, use, light, such, as, infrared, laser, or, visible, light, radio, waves, or, other, electromagnetic, radiation, to, illuminate, the, target, once, the, guidance, system, identifies, the, target, the, target, might, required, to, be, tracked, continuously, if, it, is, in, motion, a, guidance, system, might, use, ins, which, consists, of, a, gyroscope, and, accelerometer, or, might, use, satellite, guidance, such, as, gps, to, track, the, missile, s, position, relative, to, a, known, target, the, missile, computers, will, compute, the, flight, path, required, to, steer, the, missile, towards, the, target, in, command, guidance, a, human, operator, may, operate, it, manually, or, a, support, or, launch, system, will, transmit, commands, by, using, either, optic, fiber, or, radio, to, guide, the, missile, the, flight, system, uses, the, data, from, the, targeting, or, guidance, system, to, maneuver, the, missile, in, flight, which, might, be, accomplished, using, vectored, thrust, of, engines, or, aerodynamic, maneuvering, using, flight, control, surfaces, such, as, wings, fins, and, canards, missiles, are, powered, by, propellants, igniting, to, produce, thrust, and, might, employ, types, of, rocket, or, jet, engines, rockets, might, be, fueled, by, solid, propellants, which, are, comparatively, easier, to, maintain, and, enables, faster, deployment, these, propellants, contain, a, fuel, and, oxidizer, mixed, in, select, proportions, with, the, grain, size, and, burn, chamber, determining, the, rate, and, time, of, burn, larger, missiles, might, use, liquid, propellant, rockets, where, propulsion, is, provided, by, a, single, or, combination, of, liquid, fuels, a, hybrid, system, uses, solid, rocket, fuel, with, a, liquid, oxidizer, jet, engines, are, generally, used, in, cruise, missiles, most, commonly, of, the, turbojet, type, because, of, their, relative, simplicity, and, low, frontal, area, while, turbofans, and, ramjets, can, also, be, theoretically, used, long, range, missiles, have, multiple, engine, stages, and, might, use, similar, type, or, a, mix, of, engine, types, some, missiles, may, have, additional, propulsion, from, another, source, at, launch, such, as, a, catapult, cannon, or, tank, gun, missiles, have, one, or, more, explosive, warheads, although, other, weapon, types, may, also, be, used, the, warheads, of, a, missile, provide, its, primary, destructive, power, which, might, cause, secondary, destruction, due, to, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, weapon, and, unused, fuel, warheads, are, most, commonly, of, the, high, explosive, type, often, employing, shaped, charges, to, exploit, the, accuracy, of, a, guided, weapon, to, destroy, hardened, targets, warhead, might, carry, conventional, incendiary, nuclear, chemical, biological, or, radiological, weapons, missiles, can, be, classified, into, categories, by, various, parameters, such, as, type, launch, platform, and, target, range, propulsion, and, guidance, system, missiles, are, generally, categorized, into, strategic, or, tactical, missile, systems, tactical, missile, systems, are, short, range, systems, used, to, carry, out, a, limited, strike, in, a, smaller, area, and, might, carry, conventional, or, nuclear, warheads, strategic, missiles, are, long, range, weapons, used, to, target, beyond, the, immediate, vicinity, and, are, mostly, designed, to, carry, nuclear, warheads, though, other, warheads, can, also, be, fitted, strategic, weapons, are, often, classified, into, cruise, and, ballistic, missiles, ballistic, missiles, are, powered, by, rockets, during, launch, and, follow, a, trajectory, that, arches, upwards, before, descending, to, reach, its, intended, target, while, cruise, missiles, are, continuously, powered, by, jet, engines, and, travel, at, a, flatter, trajectory, a, ballistic, missile, is, powered, by, single, or, multiple, rockets, in, stages, initially, before, following, an, unpowered, trajectory, that, arches, upwards, before, descending, to, reach, its, intended, target, it, can, carry, both, nuclear, and, conventional, warheads, a, ballistic, missile, might, reach, supersonic, or, hypersonic, speed, and, often, travel, out, of, the, earth, s, atmosphere, before, re, entry, it, usually, has, three, stages, of, flight, ballistic, missiles, are, categorized, based, on, range, as, a, cruise, missile, is, a, guided, missile, that, remains, in, the, atmosphere, and, flies, the, major, portion, of, its, flight, at, a, constant, speed, it, is, designed, to, deliver, a, large, warhead, over, long, distances, with, high, precision, and, are, propelled, by, jet, engines, a, cruise, missile, can, be, launched, from, multiple, platforms, and, is, often, self, guided, it, flies, at, lower, speeds, often, subsonic, or, supersonic, and, close, to, the, surface, of, the, earth, which, expends, more, fuel, but, makes, it, difficult, to, detect, missiles, might, be, also, be, classified, basis, launch, platform, and, target, into, surface, to, air, surface, to, surface, air, to, air, air, to, surface, anti, ship, and, anti, tank, an, anti, ship, missile, ashm, is, designed, for, use, against, large, boats, and, ships, such, as, destroyers, and, aircraft, carriers, most, anti, ship, missiles, are, of, the, sea, skimming, variety, and, many, use, a, combination, of, inertial, guidance, and, active, radar, homing, a, large, number, of, other, anti, ship, missiles, use, infrared, homing, to, follow, the, heat, that, is, emitted, by, a, ship, it, is, also, possible, for, anti, ship, missiles, to, be, guided, by, radio, command, all, the, way, many, anti, ship, missiles, can, be, launched, from, a, variety, of, weapons, systems, including, surface, warships, submarines, fighter, aircraft, maritime, patrol, aircraft, helicopters, shore, batteries, land, vehicles, and, by, infantry, anti, submarine, missile, is, a, standoff, anti, submarine, weapon, variant, of, anti, ship, missiles, used, to, deliver, an, explosive, warhead, aimed, directly, at, a, submarine, a, depth, charge, or, a, homing, torpedo, an, anti, tank, guided, missile, atgm, is, a, guided, missile, primarily, designed, to, hit, and, destroy, heavily, armored, military, vehicles, atgms, range, in, size, from, shoulder, launched, weapons, which, can, be, transported, by, a, single, soldier, to, larger, tripod, mounted, or, vehicle, and, aircraft, mounted, missile, systems, earlier, man, portable, anti, tank, weapons, like, anti, tank, rifles, and, magnetic, anti, tank, mines, had, a, short, range, but, sophisticated, antitank, missiles, can, be, directed, to, a, longer, target, by, several,
