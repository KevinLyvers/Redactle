in, computing, a, computer, file, is, a, resource, for, recording, data, on, a, computer, storage, device, primarily, identified, by, its, filename, just, as, words, can, be, written, on, paper, so, too, can, data, be, written, to, a, computer, file, files, can, be, shared, with, and, transferred, between, computers, and, mobile, devices, via, removable, media, networks, or, the, internet, different, types, of, computer, files, are, designed, for, different, purposes, a, file, may, be, designed, to, store, an, image, a, written, message, a, video, a, program, or, any, wide, variety, of, other, kinds, of, data, certain, files, can, store, multiple, data, types, at, once, by, using, computer, programs, a, person, can, open, read, change, save, and, close, a, computer, file, computer, files, may, be, reopened, modified, and, copied, an, arbitrary, number, of, times, files, are, typically, organized, in, a, file, system, which, tracks, file, locations, on, the, disk, and, enables, user, access, the, word, file, derives, from, the, latin, filum, a, thread, string, file, was, used, in, the, context, of, computer, storage, as, early, as, january, 1940, in, punched, card, methods, in, scientific, computation, w, j, eckert, stated, the, first, extensive, use, of, the, early, hollerith, tabulator, in, astronomy, was, made, by, comrie, he, used, it, for, building, a, table, from, successive, differences, and, for, adding, large, numbers, of, harmonic, terms, tables, of, functions, are, constructed, from, their, differences, with, great, efficiency, either, as, printed, tables, or, as, a, file, of, punched, cards, in, february, 1950, in, a, radio, corporation, of, america, rca, advertisement, in, popular, science, magazine, describing, a, new, memory, vacuum, tube, it, had, developed, rca, stated, the, results, of, countless, computations, can, be, kept, on, file, and, taken, out, again, such, a, file, now, exists, in, a, memory, tube, developed, at, rca, laboratories, electronically, it, retains, figures, fed, into, calculating, machines, holds, them, in, storage, while, it, memorizes, new, ones, speeds, intelligent, solutions, through, mazes, of, mathematics, in, 1952, file, denoted, among, other, things, information, stored, on, punched, cards, in, early, use, the, underlying, hardware, rather, than, the, contents, stored, on, it, was, denominated, a, file, for, example, the, ibm, 350, disk, drives, were, denominated, disk, files, the, introduction, c, 1961, by, the, burroughs, mcp, and, the, mit, compatible, time, sharing, system, of, the, concept, of, a, file, system, that, managed, several, virtual, files, on, one, storage, device, is, the, origin, of, the, contemporary, denotation, of, the, word, although, the, contemporary, register, file, demonstrates, the, early, concept, of, files, its, use, has, greatly, decreased, on, most, modern, operating, systems, files, are, organized, into, one, dimensional, arrays, of, bytes, the, format, of, a, file, is, defined, by, its, content, since, a, file, is, solely, a, container, for, data, on, some, platforms, the, format, is, indicated, by, its, filename, extension, specifying, the, rules, for, how, the, bytes, must, be, organized, and, interpreted, meaningfully, for, example, the, bytes, of, a, plain, text, file, txt, in, windows, are, associated, with, either, ascii, or, utf, 8, characters, while, the, bytes, of, image, video, and, audio, files, are, interpreted, otherwise, most, file, types, also, allocate, a, few, bytes, for, metadata, which, allows, a, file, to, carry, some, basic, information, about, itself, some, file, systems, can, store, arbitrary, not, interpreted, by, the, file, system, file, specific, data, outside, of, the, file, format, but, linked, to, the, file, for, example, extended, attributes, or, forks, on, other, file, systems, this, can, be, done, via, sidecar, files, or, software, specific, databases, all, those, methods, however, are, more, susceptible, to, loss, of, metadata, than, container, and, archive, file, formats, at, any, instant, in, time, a, file, has, a, specific, size, normally, expressed, as, a, number, of, bytes, that, indicates, how, much, storage, is, occupied, by, the, file, in, most, modern, operating, systems, the, size, can, be, any, non, negative, whole, number, of, bytes, up, to, a, system, limit, many, older, operating, systems, kept, track, only, of, the, number, of, blocks, or, tracks, occupied, by, a, file, on, a, physical, storage, device, in, such, systems, software, employed, other, methods, to, track, the, exact, byte, count, e, g, cp, m, used, a, special, control, character, ctrl, z, to, signal, the, end, of, text, files, the, general, definition, of, a, file, does, not, require, that, its, size, have, any, real, meaning, however, unless, the, data, within, the, file, happens, to, correspond, to, data, within, a, pool, of, persistent, storage, a, special, case, is, a, zero, byte, file, these, files, can, be, newly, created, files, that, have, not, yet, had, any, data, written, to, them, or, may, serve, as, some, kind, of, flag, in, the, file, system, or, are, accidents, the, results, of, aborted, disk, operations, for, example, the, file, to, which, the, link, bin, ls, points, in, a, typical, unix, like, system, probably, has, a, defined, size, that, seldom, changes, compare, this, with, dev, null, which, is, also, a, file, but, as, a, character, special, file, its, size, is, not, meaningful, information, in, a, computer, file, can, consist, of, smaller, packets, of, information, often, called, records, or, lines, that, are, individually, different, but, share, some, common, traits, for, example, a, payroll, file, might, contain, information, concerning, all, the, employees, in, a, company, and, their, payroll, details, each, record, in, the, payroll, file, concerns, just, one, employee, and, all, the, records, have, the, common, trait, of, being, related, to, payroll, this, is, very, similar, to, placing, all, payroll, information, into, a, specific, filing, cabinet, in, an, office, that, does, not, have, a, computer, a, text, file, may, contain, lines, of, text, corresponding, to, printed, lines, on, a, piece, of, paper, alternatively, a, file, may, contain, an, arbitrary, binary, image, a, blob, or, it, may, contain, an, executable, the, way, information, is, grouped, into, a, file, is, entirely, up, to, how, it, is, designed, this, has, led, to, a, plethora, of, more, or, less, standardized, file, structures, for, all, imaginable, purposes, from, the, simplest, to, the, most, complex, most, computer, files, are, used, by, computer, programs, which, create, modify, or, delete, the, files, for, their, own, use, on, an, as, needed, basis, the, programmers, who, create, the, programs, decide, what, files, are, needed, how, they, are, to, be, used, and, often, their, names, in, some, cases, computer, programs, manipulate, files, that, are, made, visible, to, the, computer, user, for, example, in, a, word, processing, program, the, user, manipulates, document, files, that, the, user, personally, names, although, the, content, of, the, document, file, is, arranged, in, a, format, that, the, word, processing, program, understands, the, user, is, able, to, choose, the, name, and, location, of, the, file, and, provide, the, bulk, of, the, information, such, as, words, and, text, that, will, be, stored, in, the, file, many, applications, pack, all, their, data, files, into, a, single, file, called, an, archive, file, using, internal, markers, to, discern, the, different, types, of, information, contained, within, the, benefits, of, the, archive, file, are, to, lower, the, number, of, files, for, easier, transfer, to, reduce, storage, usage, or, just, to, organize, outdated, files, the, archive, file, must, often, be, unpacked, before, next, using, the, most, basic, operations, that, programs, can, perform, on, a, file, are, files, on, a, computer, can, be, created, moved, modified, grown, shrunk, truncated, and, deleted, in, most, cases, computer, programs, that, are, executed, on, the, computer, handle, these, operations, but, the, user, of, a, computer, can, also, manipulate, files, if, necessary, for, instance, microsoft, word, files, are, normally, created, and, modified, by, the, microsoft, word, program, in, response, to, user, commands, but, the, user, can, also, move, rename, or, delete, these, files, directly, by, using, a, file, manager, program, such, as, windows, explorer, on, windows, computers, or, by, command, lines, cli, in, unix, like, systems, user, space, programs, do, not, operate, directly, at, a, low, level, on, a, file, only, the, kernel, deals, with, files, and, it, handles, all, user, space, interaction, with, files, in, a, manner, that, is, transparent, to, the, user, space, programs, the, operating, system, provides, a, level, of, abstraction, which, means, that, interaction, with, a, file, from, user, space, is, simply, through, its, filename, instead, of, its, inode, for, example, rm, filename, will, not, delete, the, file, itself, but, only, a, link, to, the, file, there, can, be, many, links, to, a, file, but, when, they, are, all, removed, the, kernel, considers, that, file, s, memory, space, free, to, be, reallocated, this, free, space, is, commonly, considered, a, security, risk, due, to, the, existence, of, file, recovery, software, any, secure, deletion, program, uses, kernel, space, system, functions, to, wipe, the, file, s, data, file, moves, within, a, file, system, complete, almost, immediately, because, the, data, content, does, not, need, to, be, rewritten, only, the, paths, need, to, be, changed, there, are, two, distinct, implementations, of, file, moves, when, moving, files, between, devices, or, partitions, some, file, managing, software, deletes, each, selected, file, from, the, source, directory, individually, after, being, transferred, while, other, software, deletes, all, files, at, once, only, after, every, file, has, been, transferred, with, the, mv, command, for, instance, the, former, method, is, used, when, selecting, files, individually, possibly, with, the, use, of, wildcards, example, mv, n, sourcepath, targetpath, while, the, latter, method, is, used, when, selecting, entire, directories, example, mv, n, sourcepath, targetpath, microsoft, windows, explorer, uses, the, former, method, for, mass, storage, file, moves, but, the, latter, method, using, media, transfer, protocol, as, described, in, media, transfer, protocol, file, move, behavior, the, former, method, individual, deletion, from, source, has, the, benefit, that, space, is, released, from, the, source, device, or, partition, imminently, after, the, transfer, has, begun, meaning, after, the, first, file, is, finished, with, the, latter, method, space, is, only, freed, after, the, transfer, of, the, entire, selection, has, finished, if, an, incomplete, file, transfer, with, the, latter, method, is, aborted, unexpectedly, perhaps, due, to, an, unexpected, power, off, system, halt, or, disconnection, of, a, device, no, space, will, have, been, freed, up, on, the, source, device, or, partition, the, user, would, need, to, merge, the, remaining, files, from, the, source, including, the, incompletely, written, truncated, last, file, with, the, individual, deletion, method, the, file, moving, software, also, does, not, need, to, cumulatively, keep, track, of, all, files, finished, transferring, for, the, case, that, a, user, manually, aborts, the, file, transfer, a, file, manager, using, the, latter, afterwards, deletion, method, will, have, to, only, delete, the, files, from, the, source, directory, that, have, already, finished, transferring, in, modern, computer, systems, files, are, typically, accessed, using, names, filenames, in, some, operating, systems, the, name, is, associated, with, the, file, itself, in, others, the, file, is, anonymous, and, is, pointed, to, by, links, that, have, names, in, the, latter, case, a, user, can, identify, the, name, of, the, link, with, the, file, itself, but, this, is, a, false, analogue, especially, where, there, exists, more, than, one, link, to, the, same, file, files, or, links, to, files, can, be, located, in, directories, however, more, generally, a, directory, can, contain, either, a, list, of, files, or, a, list, of, links, to, files, within, this, definition, it, is, of, paramount, importance, that, the, term, file, includes, directories, this, permits, the, existence, of, directory, hierarchies, i, e, directories, containing, sub, directories, a, name, that, refers, to, a, file, within, a, directory, must, be, typically, unique, in, other, words, there, must, be, no, identical, names, within, a, directory, however, in, some, operating, systems, a, name, may, include, a, specification, of, type, that, means, a, directory, can, contain, an, identical, name, for, more, than, one, type, of, object, such, as, a, directory, and, a, file, in, environments, in, which, a, file, is, named, a, file, s, name, and, the, path, to, the, file, s, directory, must, uniquely, identify, it, among, all, other, files, in, the, computer, system, no, two, files, can, have, the, same, name, and, path, where, a, file, is, anonymous, named, references, to, it, will, exist, within, a, namespace, in, most, cases, any, name, within, the, namespace, will, refer, to, exactly, zero, or, one, file, however, any, file, may, be, represented, within, any, namespace, by, zero, one, or, more, names, any, string, of, characters, may, be, a, well, formed, name, for, a, file, or, a, link, depending, upon, the, context, of, application, whether, or, not, a, name, is, well, formed, depends, on, the, type, of, computer, system, being, used, early, computers, permitted, only, a, few, letters, or, digits, in, the, name, of, a, file, but, modern, computers, allow, long, names, some, up, to, 255, characters, containing, almost, any, combination, of, unicode, letters, or, unicode, digits, making, it, easier, to, understand, the, purpose, of, a, file, at, a, glance, some, computer, systems, allow, file, names, to, contain, spaces, others, do, not, case, sensitivity, of, file, names, is, determined, by, the, file, system, unix, file, systems, are, usually, case, sensitive, and, allow, user, level, applications, to, create, files, whose, names, differ, only, in, the, case, of, characters, microsoft, windows, supports, multiple, file, systems, each, with, different, policies, regarding, case, sensitivity, the, common, fat, file, system, can, have, multiple, files, whose, names, differ, only, in, case, if, the, user, uses, a, disk, editor, to, edit, the, file, names, in, the, directory, entries, user, applications, however, will, usually, not, allow, the, user, to, create, multiple, files, with, the, same, name, but, differing, in, case, most, computers, organize, files, into, hierarchies, using, folders, directories, or, catalogs, the, concept, is, the, same, irrespective, of, the, terminology, used, each, folder, can, contain, an, arbitrary, number, of, files, and, it, can, also, contain, other, folders, these, other, folders, are, referred, to, as, subfolders, subfolders, can, contain, still, more, files, and, folders, and, so, on, thus, building, a, tree, like, structure, in, which, one, master, folder, or, root, folder, the, name, varies, from, one, operating, system, to, another, can, contain, any, number, of, levels, of, other, folders, and, files, folders, can, be, named, just, as, files, can, except, for, the, root, folder, which, often, does, not, have, a, name, the, use, of, folders, makes, it, easier, to, organize, files, in, a, logical, way, when, a, computer, allows, the, use, of, folders, each, file, and, folder, has, not, only, a, name, of, its, own, but, also, a, path, which, identifies, the, folder, or, folders, in, which, a, file, or, folder, resides, in, the, path, some, sort, of, special, character, such, as, a, slash, is, used, to, separate, the, file, and, folder, names, for, example, in, the, illustration, shown, in, this, article, the, path, payroll, salaries, managers, uniquely, identifies, a, file, called, managers, in, a, folder, called, salaries, which, in, turn, is, contained, in, a, folder, called, payroll, the, folder, and, file, names, are, separated, by, slashes, in, this, example, the, topmost, or, root, folder, has, no, name, and, so, the, path, begins, with, a, slash, if, the, root, folder, had, a, name, it, would, precede, this, first, slash, many, computer, systems, use, extensions, in, file, names, to, help, identify, what, they, contain, also, known, as, the, file, type, on, windows, computers, extensions, consist, of, a, dot, period, at, the, end, of, a, file, name, followed, by, a, few, letters, to, identify, the, type, of, file, an, extension, of, txt, identifies, a, text, file, a, doc, extension, identifies, any, type, of, document, or, documentation, commonly, in, the, microsoft, word, file, format, and, so, on, even, when, extensions, are, used, in, a, computer, system, the, degree, to, which, the, computer, system, recognizes, and, heeds, them, can, vary, in, some, systems, they, are, required, while, in, other, systems, they, are, completely, ignored, if, they, are, presented, many, modern, computer, systems, provide, methods, for, protecting, files, against, accidental, and, deliberate, damage, computers, that, allow, for, multiple, users, implement, file, permissions, to, control, who, may, or, may, not, modify, delete, or, create, files, and, folders, for, example, a, given, user, may, be, granted, only, permission, to, read, a, file, or, folder, but, not, to, modify, or, delete, it, or, a, user, may, be, given, permission, to, read, and, modify, files, or, folders, but, not, to, execute, them, permissions, may, also, be, used, to, allow, only, certain, users, to, see, the, contents, of, a, file, or, folder, permissions, protect, against, unauthorized, tampering, or, destruction, of, information, in, files, and, keep, private, information, confidential, from, unauthorized, users, another, protection, mechanism, implemented, in, many, computers, is, a, read, only, flag, when, this, flag, is, turned, on, for, a, file, which, can, be, accomplished, by, a, computer, program, or, by, a, human, user, the, file, can, be, examined, but, it, cannot, be, modified, this, flag, is, useful, for, critical, information, that, must, not, be, modified, or, erased, such, as, special, files, that, are, used, only, by, internal, parts, of, the, computer, system, some, systems, also, include, a, hidden, flag, to, make, certain, files, invisible, this, flag, is, used, by, the, computer, system, to, hide, essential, system, files, that, users, should, not, alter, any, file, that, has, any, useful, purpose, must, have, some, physical, manifestation, that, is, a, file, an, abstract, concept, in, a, real, computer, system, must, have, a, real, physical, analogue, if, it, is, to, exist, at, all, in, physical, terms, most, computer, files, are, stored, on, some, type, of, data, storage, device, for, example, most, operating, systems, store, files, on, a, hard, disk, hard, disks, have, been, the, ubiquitous, form, of, non, volatile, storage, since, the, early, 1960s, where, files, contain, only, temporary, information, they, may, be, stored, in, ram, computer, files, can, be, also, stored, on, other, media, in, some, cases, such, as, magnetic, tapes, compact, discs, digital, versatile, discs, zip, drives, usb, flash, drives, etc, the, use, of, solid, state, drives, is, also, beginning, to, rival, the, hard, disk, drive, in, unix, like, operating, systems, many, files, have, no, associated, physical, storage, device, examples, are, dev, null, and, most, files, under, directories, dev, proc, and, sys, these, are, virtual, files, they, exist, as, objects, within, the, operating, system, kernel, as, seen, by, a, running, user, program, files, are, usually, represented, either, by, a, file, control, block, or, by, a, file, handle, a, file, control, block, fcb, is, an, area, of, memory, which, is, manipulated, to, establish, a, filename, etc, and, then, passed, to, the, operating, system, as, a, parameter, it, was, used, by, older, ibm, operating, systems, and, early, pc, operating, systems, including, cp, m, and, early, versions, of, ms, dos, a, file, handle, is, generally, either, an, opaque, data, type, or, an, integer, it, was, introduced, in, around, 1961, by, the, algol, based, burroughs, mcp, running, on, the, burroughs, b5000, but, is, now, ubiquitous, when, a, file, is, said, to, be, corrupted, it, is, because, its, contents, have, been, saved, to, the, computer, in, such, a, way, that, they, cannot, be, properly, read, either, by, a, human, or, by, software, depending, on, the, extent, of, the, damage, the, original, file, can, sometimes, be, recovered, or, at, least, partially, understood, a, file, may, be, created, corrupt, or, it, may, be, corrupted, at, a, later, point, through, overwriting, there, are, many, ways, by, which, a, file, can, become, corrupted, most, commonly, the, issue, happens, in, the, process, of, writing, the, file, to, a, disk, for, example, if, an, image, editing, program, unexpectedly, crashes, while, saving, an, image, that, file, may, be, corrupted, because, the, program, could, not, save, its, entirety, the, program, itself, might, warn, the, user, that, there, was, an, error, allowing, for, another, attempt, at, saving, the, file, some, other, examples, of, reasons, for, which, files, become, corrupted, include, although, file, corruption, usually, happens, accidentally, it, may, also, be, done, on, purpose, as, a, mean, of, procrastination, as, to, fool, someone, else, into, thinking, an, assignment, was, ready, at, an, earlier, date, potentially, gaining, time, to, finish, said, assignment, or, making, experiments, with, the, purpose, of, documenting, the, consequences, when, such, file, is, corrupted, there, are, services, that, provide, on, demand, file, corruption, which, essentially, fill, a, given, file, with, random, data, so, that, it, cannot, be, opened, or, read, yet, still, seems, legitimate, one, of, the, most, effective, countermeasures, for, unintentional, file, corruption, is, backing, up, important, files, in, the, event, of, an, important, file, becoming, corrupted, the, user, can, simply, replace, it, with, the, backed, up, version, when, computer, files, contain, information, that, is, extremely, important, a, back, up, process, is, used, to, protect, against, disasters, that, might, destroy, the, files, backing, up, files, simply, means, making, copies, of, the, files, in, a, separate, location, so, that, they, can, be, restored, if, something, happens, to, the, computer, or, if, they, are, deleted, accidentally, there, are, many, ways, to, back, up, files, most, computer, systems, provide, utility, programs, to, assist, in, the, back, up, process, which, can, become, very, time, consuming, if, there, are, many, files, to, safeguard, files, are, often, copied, to, removable, media, such, as, writable, cds, or, cartridge, tapes, copying, files, to, another, hard, disk, in, the, same, computer, protects, against, failure, of, one, disk, but, if, it, is, necessary, to, protect, against, failure, or, destruction, of, the, entire, computer, then, copies, of, the, files, must, be, made, on, other, media, that, can, be, taken, away, from, the, computer, and, stored, in, a, safe, distant, location, the, grandfather, father, son, backup, method, automatically, makes, three, back, ups, the, grandfather, file, is, the, oldest, copy, of, the, file, and, the, son, is, the, current, copy, the, way, a, computer, organizes, names, stores, and, manipulates, files, is, globally, referred, to, as, its, file, system, most, computers, have, at, least, one, file, system, some, computers, allow, the, use, of, several, different, file, systems, for, instance, on, newer, ms, windows, computers, the, older, fat, type, file, systems, of, ms, dos, and, old, versions, of, windows, are, supported, in, addition, to, the, ntfs, file, system, that, is, the, normal, file, system, for, recent, versions, of, windows, each, system, has, its, own, advantages, and, disadvantages, standard, fat, allows, only, eight, character, file, names, plus, a, three, character, extension, with, no, spaces, for, example, whereas, ntfs, allows, much, longer, names, that, can, contain, spaces, you, can, call, a, file, payroll, records, in, ntfs, but, in, fat, you, would, be, restricted, to, something, like, payroll, dat, unless, you, were, using, vfat, a, fat, extension, allowing, long, file, names, file, manager, programs, are, utility, programs, that, allow, users, to, manipulate, files, directly, they, allow, you, to, move, create, delete, and, rename, files, and, folders, although, they, do, not, actually, allow, you, to, read, the, contents, of, a, file, or, store, information, in, it, every, computer, system, provides, at, least, one, file, manager, program, for, its, native, file, system, for, example, file, explorer, formerly, windows, explorer, is, commonly, used, in, microsoft, windows, operating, systems, and, nautilus, is, common, under, several, distributions, of, linux
