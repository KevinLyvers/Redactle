charcoal, is, a, lightweight, black, carbon, residue, produced, by, strongly, heating, wood, or, other, animal, and, plant, materials, in, minimal, oxygen, to, remove, all, water, and, volatile, constituents, in, the, traditional, version, of, this, pyrolysis, process, called, charcoal, burning, often, by, forming, a, charcoal, kiln, the, heat, is, supplied, by, burning, part, of, the, starting, material, itself, with, a, limited, supply, of, oxygen, the, material, can, also, be, heated, in, a, closed, retort, modern, charcoal, briquettes, used, for, outdoor, cooking, may, contain, many, other, additives, e, g, coal, charcoal, wooden, coal, is, a, solid, substance, resulting, from, the, dry, distillation, of, wood, without, oxygen, it, is, used, in, the, production, of, ferrous, and, non, ferrous, metals, activated, carbon, and, also, as, a, household, fuel, the, history, of, wood, charcoal, production, spans, ancient, times, rooted, in, the, abundance, of, wood, in, various, regions, the, process, typically, involves, stacking, wood, billets, to, form, a, conical, pile, allowing, air, to, enter, through, openings, at, the, bottom, and, igniting, the, pile, gradually, charcoal, burners, skilled, professionals, tasked, with, managing, the, delicate, operation, often, lived, in, isolation, to, tend, their, wood, piles, throughout, history, the, extensive, production, of, charcoal, has, been, a, significant, contributor, to, deforestation, particularly, in, regions, like, central, europe, however, various, management, practices, such, as, coppicing, aimed, to, maintain, a, steady, supply, of, wood, for, charcoal, production, the, scarcity, of, easily, accessible, wood, resources, eventually, led, to, the, transition, to, fossil, fuel, equivalents, like, coal, modern, methods, of, charcoal, production, involve, carbonizing, wood, in, retorts, yielding, higher, efficiencies, compared, to, traditional, kilning, methods, the, properties, of, charcoal, depend, on, factors, such, as, the, material, charred, and, the, temperature, of, carbonization, charcoal, finds, diverse, applications, including, metallurgical, fuel, in, iron, and, steel, production, industrial, fuel, cooking, and, heating, fuel, reducing, agent, in, chemical, processes, and, as, a, raw, material, in, pyrotechnics, it, is, also, utilized, in, cosmetics, horticulture, animal, husbandry, medicine, and, environmental, sustainability, efforts, such, as, carbon, sequestration, however, the, production, and, utilization, of, charcoal, can, have, adverse, environmental, impacts, including, deforestation, and, emissions, illegal, and, unregulated, charcoal, production, particularly, in, regions, like, south, america, and, africa, poses, significant, challenges, to, environmental, conservation, efforts, the, production, of, wood, charcoal, in, locations, where, there, is, an, abundance, of, wood, dates, back, to, ancient, times, it, generally, began, with, piling, billets, of, wood, on, their, ends, to, form, a, conical, pile, openings, were, left, at, the, bottom, to, admit, air, with, a, central, shaft, serving, as, a, flue, the, whole, pile, was, covered, with, turf, or, moistened, clay, the, firing, began, at, the, bottom, of, the, flue, and, the, fire, gradually, spread, outward, and, upward, the, traditional, method, in, britain, used, a, clamp, this, was, essentially, a, pile, of, wooden, logs, e, g, seasoned, oak, leaning, in, a, circle, against, a, chimney, the, chimney, consisted, of, 4, wooden, stakes, held, up, by, some, rope, in, the, clamp, too, the, logs, were, completely, covered, with, soil, and, straw, allowing, no, air, to, enter, it, must, be, lit, by, introducing, some, burning, fuel, into, the, chimney, the, logs, burned, slowly, and, transformed, into, charcoal, over, a, period, of, 5, days, if, the, soil, covering, became, torn, or, cracked, by, the, fire, additional, soil, was, placed, on, the, cracks, once, the, burn, was, complete, the, chimney, was, plugged, to, prevent, air, from, entering, the, true, art, of, this, production, method, was, in, managing, the, sufficient, generation, of, heat, by, combusting, part, of, the, wood, material, and, the, transfer, of, the, heat, to, the, wood, in, the, process, of, being, carbonized, the, operation, was, so, delicate, that, it, was, generally, left, to, colliers, professional, charcoal, burners, they, often, lived, alone, in, small, huts, to, tend, their, wood, piles, for, example, in, the, harz, mountains, of, germany, charcoal, burners, lived, in, conical, huts, called, k, ten, which, still, exist, today, the, success, of, the, operation, depends, upon, the, rate, of, the, combustion, under, average, conditions, wood, yields, about, 60, charcoal, by, volume, or, 25, by, weight, small, scale, production, methods, often, yield, only, about, 50, by, volume, while, large, scale, methods, enabled, higher, yields, of, about, 90, by, the, 17th, century, a, strong, disadvantage, of, this, production, method, is, the, huge, amount, of, emissions, that, are, harmful, to, human, health, and, the, environment, emissions, of, unburnt, methane, as, a, result, of, the, partial, combustion, of, wood, material, the, efficiency, of, the, traditional, method, is, low, the, massive, production, of, charcoal, at, its, height, employing, hundreds, of, thousands, mainly, in, alpine, and, neighbouring, forests, was, a, major, cause, of, deforestation, especially, in, central, europe, complaints, as, early, as, the, stuart, period, about, shortages, may, stem, from, over, exploitation, or, the, impossibility, of, increasing, production, to, match, growing, demand, in, england, many, woods, were, managed, as, coppices, which, were, cut, and, regrown, cyclically, so, that, a, steady, supply, of, charcoal, was, available, but, the, increasing, scarcity, of, easily, harvested, wood, was, a, major, factor, behind, the, switch, to, fossil, fuel, equivalents, mainly, coal, and, brown, coal, for, industrial, use, in, finland, and, scandinavia, the, charcoal, was, considered, the, by, product, of, wood, tar, production, the, best, tar, came, from, pine, thus, pinewoods, were, cut, down, for, tar, pyrolysis, the, residual, charcoal, was, widely, used, as, substitute, for, metallurgical, coke, in, blast, furnaces, for, smelting, tar, production, led, to, rapid, local, deforestation, the, end, of, tar, production, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, resulted, in, rapid, re, forestation, of, affected, areas, the, american, form, of, the, charcoal, briquette, was, first, invented, and, patented, by, ellsworth, b, a, zwoyer, of, pennsylvania, in, 1897, and, was, produced, by, the, zwoyer, fuel, company, the, process, was, further, popularized, by, henry, ford, who, used, wood, and, sawdust, byproducts, from, automobile, fabrication, as, a, feedstock, ford, charcoal, went, on, to, become, the, kingsford, company, the, modern, process, of, carbonizing, wood, either, in, small, pieces, or, as, sawdust, in, cast, iron, retorts, is, extensively, practiced, where, wood, is, scarce, and, also, for, the, recovery, of, valuable, byproducts, wood, spirit, pyroligneous, acid, wood, tar, which, the, process, permits, the, question, of, the, temperature, of, the, carbonization, is, important, according, to, j, percy, wood, becomes, brown, at, 220, c, 430, f, a, deep, brown, black, after, some, time, at, 280, c, 540, f, and, an, easily, powdered, mass, at, 310, c, 590, f, charcoal, made, at, 300, c, 570, f, is, brown, soft, and, friable, and, readily, inflames, at, 380, c, 720, f, made, at, higher, temperatures, it, is, hard, and, brittle, and, does, not, fire, until, heated, to, about, 700, c, 1, 300, f, modern, methods, employ, retorting, technology, in, which, process, heat, is, recovered, from, and, solely, provided, by, the, combustion, of, gas, released, during, carbonization, yields, of, retorting, are, considerably, higher, than, those, of, kilning, and, may, reach, 35, 40, the, properties, of, the, charcoal, produced, depend, on, the, material, charred, the, charring, temperature, is, also, important, charcoal, contains, varying, amounts, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, as, well, as, ash, and, other, impurities, that, together, with, the, structure, determine, the, properties, the, approximate, composition, of, charcoal, for, gunpowders, is, sometimes, empirically, described, as, c, 7, h, 4, o, to, obtain, a, coal, with, high, purity, source, material, should, be, free, of, non, volatile, compounds, wood, charcoal, is, obtained, as, the, residue, by, destructive, distillation, of, wood, such, that, the, products, are, charcoal, has, been, used, since, earliest, times, for, a, large, range, of, purposes, including, art, and, medicine, but, by, far, its, most, important, use, has, been, as, a, metallurgical, fuel, charcoal, is, the, traditional, fuel, of, a, blacksmith, s, forge, and, other, applications, where, an, intense, heat, is, required, charcoal, was, also, used, historically, as, a, source, of, black, pigment, by, grinding, it, up, in, this, form, charcoal, was, important, to, early, chemists, and, was, a, constituent, of, formulas, for, mixtures, such, as, black, powder, due, to, its, high, surface, area, charcoal, can, be, used, as, a, filter, catalyst, or, adsorbent, charcoal, burns, at, temperatures, exceeding, 1, 100, degrees, celsius, 2, 010, degrees, fahrenheit, by, comparison, the, melting, point, of, iron, is, approximately, 1, 200, to, 1, 550, c, 2, 190, to, 2, 820, f, due, to, its, porosity, it, is, sensitive, to, the, flow, of, air, and, the, heat, generated, can, be, moderated, by, controlling, the, air, flow, to, the, fire, for, this, reason, charcoal, is, still, widely, used, by, blacksmiths, charcoal, has, been, used, for, the, production, of, iron, and, steel, where, it, also, provided, the, necessary, carbon, since, at, least, 2000, bce, with, artifacts, having, been, found, in, proto, hittite, layers, at, kaman, kaleh, y, k, charcoal, briquettes, can, burn, up, to, approximately, 1, 260, c, 2, 300, f, with, a, forced, air, blower, forge, in, the, 16th, century, england, had, to, pass, laws, to, prevent, the, country, from, becoming, completely, denuded, of, trees, due, to, production, of, iron, in, the, 19th, century, charcoal, was, largely, replaced, by, coke, in, steel, production, due, to, cost, even, though, coke, usually, adds, sulphur, and, sometimes, other, deleterious, contaminants, to, the, pig, iron, wooded, metallurgical, regions, devoid, of, coal, like, sweden, the, urals, or, siberia, transitioned, from, charcoal, in, the, early, 20th, century, prior, to, the, industrial, revolution, charcoal, was, occasionally, used, as, a, cooking, fuel, it, is, counted, as, a, smokeless, fuel, that, is, the, carbon, is, sufficiently, pure, that, burning, it, causes, substantially, less, air, pollution, than, burning, the, original, uncarbonized, organic, material, would, in, the, 20th, century, clean, air, legislation, mandated, smokeless, fuels, mostly, coke, or, charcoal, in, many, areas, of, europe, in, the, 21st, century, charcoal, has, been, advocated, as, a, way, to, improve, the, health, of, people, burning, raw, biomass, for, cooking, and, or, heating, modern, charcoal, briquettes, widely, used, for, outdoor, cooking, are, made, with, charcoal, but, may, also, include, coal, as, an, energy, source, as, well, as, accelerants, binders, and, filler, to, contain, the, charcoal, and, use, it, for, cooking, purposes, a, barbecue, grill, may, be, used, a, small, japanese, charcoal, grill, is, known, as, a, shichirin, a, brazier, is, a, container, used, to, burn, charcoal, or, other, solid, fuel, to, start, the, charcoal, burning, is, harder, than, starting, a, wood, fire, and, charcoal, lighter, fluid, may, be, employed, a, chimney, starter, or, electric, charcoal, starter, are, tools, to, help, with, starting, to, light, charcoal, approximately, 75, of, fuel, burned, in, haiti, is, charcoal, certain, types, of, charcoal, such, as, wood, charcoal, are, used, for, reducing, heated, metallic, oxides, to, their, respective, metals, charcoal, can, also, be, used, to, reduce, super, heated, steam, to, hydrogen, along, with, the, formation, of, carbon, monoxide, like, many, other, sources, of, carbon, charcoal, can, be, used, for, the, production, of, various, syngas, compositions, i, e, various, co, h, 2, co, 2, n, 2, mixtures, the, syngas, is, typically, used, as, fuel, including, automotive, propulsion, or, as, a, chemical, feedstock, in, times, of, scarce, petroleum, automobiles, and, even, buses, have, been, converted, to, burn, wood, gas, a, gas, mixture, consisting, primarily, of, diluting, atmospheric, nitrogen, but, also, containing, combustible, gasses, mostly, carbon, monoxide, released, by, burning, charcoal, or, wood, in, a, wood, gas, generator, in, 1931, tang, zhongming, developed, an, automobile, powered, by, charcoal, and, these, cars, were, popular, in, china, until, the, 1950s, and, in, occupied, france, during, world, war, ii, where, they, were, called, gazog, nes, charcoal, is, used, in, the, production, of, black, powder, which, is, used, extensively, in, the, production, of, fireworks, it, is, usually, ground, into, a, fine, powder, with, air, float, grade, being, the, finest, particle, size, available, commercially, when, used, in, black, powder, compositions, it, is, often, ball, milled, with, other, ingredients, so, that, they, are, intimately, mixed, together, certain, charcoals, perform, better, when, used, to, make, black, powder, these, include, spruce, willow, paulownia, and, grapevine, among, others, charcoal, produces, fine, dark, orange, golden, sparks, usually, powder, with, a, mesh, size, from, 10, to, 325, is, used, to, obtain, showers, of, golden, sparks, in, pyrotechnic, compositions, charcoal, is, also, incorporated, in, multiple, cosmetic, products, it, can, be, produced, from, regular, bamboo, cut, into, small, pieces, and, boiled, in, water, to, remove, soluble, compounds, raw, bamboo, charcoal, is, obtained, after, drying, and, carbonization, in, an, oven, at, elevated, temperature, the, role, of, charcoal, in, cosmetics, is, based, on, its, highly, effective, absorbing, properties, at, a, microscopic, scale, charcoal, may, be, used, as, a, source, of, carbon, in, chemical, reactions, one, example, of, this, is, the, production, of, carbon, disulphide, through, the, reaction, of, sulfur, vapors, with, hot, charcoal, in, that, case, the, wood, should, be, charred, at, high, temperature, to, reduce, the, residual, amounts, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, that, lead, to, side, reactions, charcoal, may, be, activated, to, increase, its, effectiveness, as, a, filter, activated, charcoal, readily, adsorbs, a, wide, range, of, organic, compounds, dissolved, or, suspended, in, gases, and, liquids, in, certain, industrial, processes, such, as, the, purification, of, sucrose, from, cane, sugar, impurities, cause, an, undesirable, color, which, can, be, removed, with, activated, charcoal, it, is, also, used, to, absorb, odors, and, toxins, in, gaseous, solutions, as, in, home, air, purifiers, and, some, types, of, gas, mask, the, medical, use, of, activated, charcoal, is, mainly, the, absorption, of, poisons, activated, charcoal, is, available, without, a, prescription, so, it, is, used, for, a, variety, of, health, related, applications, for, example, it, is, often, used, to, reduce, discomfort, and, embarrassment, due, to, excessive, gas, flatulence, in, the, digestive, tract, animal, charcoal, or, bone, black, is, the, carbonaceous, residue, obtained, by, the, dry, distillation, of, bones, it, contains, only, about, 10, carbon, the, remaining, being, calcium, and, magnesium, phosphates, 80, and, other, inorganic, material, originally, present, in, the, bones, it, is, generally, manufactured, from, the, residues, obtained, in, the, glue, and, gelatin, industries, its, bleaching, power, was, applied, in, 1812, by, derosne, for, clarifying, sugar, syrup, but, its, use, in, this, direction, has, now, greatly, diminished, today, it, is, seldom, used, for, this, purpose, due, to, the, introduction, of, more, active, and, easily, managed, reagents, but, it, is, still, employed, to, some, extent, in, laboratory, practice, the, bleaching, action, of, the, charcoal, in, solution, diminishes, as, it, adsorbs, colored, contaminants, and, it, must, be, reactivated, periodically, by, separate, washing, and, reheating, while, wood, charcoal, effectively, removes, some, pigments, and, contaminants, from, solutions, bone, charcoal, is, generally, more, effective, as, an, adsorption, filter, due, to, its, increased, porosity, and, surface, area, charcoal, is, used, for, drawing, making, rough, sketches, in, painting, and, is, one, of, the, possible, media, used, for, making, a, parsemage, it, usually, must, be, preserved, by, the, application, of, a, fixative, artists, generally, utilize, charcoal, in, four, forms, one, additional, use, of, charcoal, was, rediscovered, recently, for, horticulture, although, american, gardeners, have, used, charcoal, for, a, short, time, research, on, terra, preta, soils, in, amazonia, has, discovered, the, widespread, use, of, biochar, by, pre, columbian, natives, to, ameliorate, unproductive, soil, into, soil, rich, in, carbon, the, technique, may, find, modern, application, both, to, improve, soils, and, as, a, means, of, carbon, sequestration, charcoal, is, mixed, with, feed, added, to, litter, or, used, in, the, treatment, of, manure, poultry, benefits, from, using, charcoal, in, this, manner, a, concern, that, activated, charcoal, might, be, used, unscrupulously, to, allow, livestock, to, tolerate, low, quality, feed, contaminated, with, aflatoxins, resulted, in, the, association, of, american, feed, control, officials, banning, it, in, 2012, from, use, in, commercial, livestock, feeds, charcoal, in, the, form, of, charcoal, biscuits, was, consumed, in, the, past, for, gastric, problems, now, it, can, be, consumed, in, tablet, capsule, or, powder, form, for, digestive, effects, research, regarding, its, effectiveness, is, controversial, charcoal, has, been, used, in, combination, with, saccharin, in, research, to, measure, mucociliary, transport, time, charcoal, has, also, been, incorporated, into, toothpaste, formulas, however, there, is, no, evidence, to, determine, its, safety, and, effectiveness, red, colobus, monkeys, in, africa, have, been, observed, eating, charcoal, for, self, medication, because, their, leafy, diets, contain, high, levels, of, cyanide, which, may, lead, to, indigestion, they, learned, to, consume, charcoal, which, absorbs, the, cyanide, and, relieves, discomfort, this, knowledge, is, transmitted, from, mother, to, infant, production, and, utilization, of, charcoal, like, any, use, of, woody, biomass, as, fuel, typically, results, in, emissions, and, can, contribute, to, deforestation, the, use, of, charcoal, as, a, smelting, fuel, has, been, experiencing, a, resurgence, in, south, america, resulting, in, severe, environmental, social, and, medical, problems, charcoal, production, at, a, sub, industrial, level, is, one, of, the, causes, of, deforestation, charcoal, production, is, now, usually, illegal, and, nearly, always, unregulated, as, in, brazil, where, charcoal, production, is, a, large, illegal, industry, for, making, pig, iron, massive, forest, destruction, has, been, documented, in, areas, such, as, virunga, national, park, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, where, it, is, considered, a, primary, threat, to, the, survival, of, the, mountain, gorillas, similar, threats, are, found, in, zambia, in, malawi, illegal, charcoal, trade, employs, 92, 800, workers, and, is, the, main, source, of, heat, and, cooking, fuel, for, 90, percent, of, the, nation, s, population, some, experts, such, as, duncan, macqueen, principal, researcher, forest, team, international, institute, for, environment, and, development, iied, argue, that, while, illegal, charcoal, production, causes, deforestation, a, regulated, charcoal, industry, that, required, replanting, and, sustainable, use, of, the, forests, would, give, their, people, clean, efficient, energy, and, their, energy, industries, a, strong, competitive, advantage, recent, assessments, of, charcoal, imported, to, europe, have, shown, that, many, charcoal, products, are, produced, from, tropical, wood, often, of, undeclared, origin, in, an, analysis, of, barbecue, charcoal, marketed, in, germany, the, world, wildlife, fund, found, that, most, products, contain, tropical, wood, as, a, notable, exception, reference, is, made, to, barbecue, charcoal, imports, from, namibia, where, charcoal, is, typically, produced, from, surplus, biomass, resulting, from, woody, plant, encroachment, charcoal, trafficking, in, somalia, is, an, economic, and, environmental, issue, with, significant, regional, security, implications, the, last, section, of, the, film, le, quattro, volte, 2010, gives, a, good, and, long, if, poetic, documentation, of, the, traditional, method, of, making, charcoal, the, arthur, ransome, children, s, series, swallows, and, amazons, particularly, the, second, book, swallowdale, features, carefully, drawn, vignettes, of, the, lives, and, the, techniques, of, charcoal, burners, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, lake, district, of, the, uk, anton, n, dvo, k, s, opera, king, and, charcoal, burner, is, based, on, a, czech, legend, about, a, king, who, gets, lost, in, a, forest, and, is, rescued, by, a, charcoal, burner
