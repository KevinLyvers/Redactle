slides, or, counterbalancing, the, door, may, be, able, to, move, in, various, ways, at, angles, away, from, the, doorway, portal, by, sliding, on, a, plane, parallel, to, the, frame, by, folding, in, angles, on, a, parallel, plane, or, by, spinning, along, an, axis, at, the, center, of, the, frame, to, allow, or, prevent, ingress, or, egress, in, most, cases, a, door, s, interior, matches, its, exterior, side, but, in, other, cases, e, g, a, vehicle, door, the, two, sides, are, radically, different, many, doors, incorporate, locking, mechanisms, to, ensure, that, only, some, people, can, open, them, such, as, with, a, key, doors, may, have, devices, such, as, knockers, or, doorbells, by, which, people, outside, announce, their, presence, apart, from, providing, access, into, and, out, of, a, space, doors, may, have, the, secondary, functions, of, ensuring, privacy, by, preventing, unwanted, attention, from, outsiders, of, separating, areas, with, different, functions, of, allowing, light, to, pass, into, and, out, of, a, space, of, controlling, ventilation, or, air, drafts, so, that, interiors, may, be, more, effectively, heated, or, cooled, of, dampening, noise, and, of, blocking, the, spread, of, fire, doors, can, have, aesthetic, symbolic, ritualistic, purposes, receiving, the, key, to, a, door, can, signify, a, change, in, status, from, outsider, to, insider, doors, and, doorways, frequently, appear, in, literature, and, the, arts, with, metaphorical, or, allegorical, import, as, a, portent, of, change, the, earliest, recorded, doors, appear, in, the, paintings, of, egyptian, tombs, which, show, them, as, single, or, double, doors, each, of, a, single, piece, of, wood, people, may, have, believed, these, were, doors, to, the, afterlife, and, some, include, designs, of, the, afterlife, in, egypt, where, the, climate, is, intensely, dry, doors, were, not, framed, against, warping, but, in, other, countries, required, framed, doors, which, according, to, vitruvius, iv, 6, was, done, with, stiles, sea, si, and, rails, see, frame, and, panel, the, enclosed, panels, filled, with, tympana, set, in, grooves, in, the, stiles, and, rails, the, stiles, were, the, vertical, boards, one, of, which, tenoned, or, hinged, is, known, as, the, hanging, stile, the, other, as, the, middle, or, meeting, stile, the, horizontal, cross, pieces, are, the, top, rail, bottom, rail, and, middle, or, intermediate, rails, the, most, ancient, doors, were, made, of, timber, such, as, those, referred, to, in, the, biblical, depiction, of, king, solomon, s, temple, being, in, olive, wood, i, kings, vi, 31, 35, which, were, carved, and, overlaid, with, gold, the, doors, that, homer, mentions, appear, to, have, been, cased, in, silver, or, brass, besides, olive, wood, elm, cedar, oak, and, cypress, were, used, two, doors, over, 5, 000, years, old, have, been, found, by, archaeologists, near, z, rich, switzerland, ancient, doors, were, hung, by, pintles, at, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, hanging, stile, which, worked, in, sockets, in, the, lintel, and, sill, the, latter, in, some, hard, stone, such, as, basalt, or, granite, those, hilprecht, found, at, nippur, dating, from, 2000, bc, were, in, dolerite, the, tenons, of, the, gates, at, balawat, were, sheathed, with, bronze, now, in, the, british, museum, these, doors, or, gates, were, hung, in, two, leaves, each, about, 2, 54, m, 100, in, wide, and, 8, 2, m, 27, ft, high, they, were, encased, with, bronze, bands, or, strips, 25, 4, cm, 10, 0, in, high, covered, with, repouss, decoration, of, figures, the, wood, doors, would, seem, to, have, been, about, 7, 62, cm, 3, 00, in, thick, but, the, hanging, stile, was, over, 360, millimetres, 14, in, diameter, other, sheathings, of, various, sizes, in, bronze, show, this, was, a, universal, method, adopted, to, protect, the, wood, pivots, in, the, hauran, in, syria, where, timber, is, scarce, the, doors, were, made, of, stone, and, one, measuring, 1, 63, by, 0, 79, m, 64, by, 31, in, is, in, the, british, museum, the, band, on, the, meeting, stile, shows, that, it, was, one, of, the, leaves, of, a, double,

doors, are, referred, to, by, dennis, ancient, greek, and, roman, doors, were, either, single, doors, double, doors, triple, doors, sliding, doors, or, folding, doors, in, the, last, case, the, leaves, were, hinged, and, folded, back, in, the, tomb, of, theron, at, agrigentum, there, is, a, single, four, panel, door, carved, in, stone, in, the, blundell, collection, is, a, bas, relief, of, a, temple, with, double, doors, each, leaf, with, five, panels, among, existing, examples, the, bronze, doors, in, the, church, of, ss, cosmas, and, damiano, in, rome, are, important, examples, of, roman, metal, work, of, the, best, period, they, are, in, two, leaves, each, with, two, panels, and, are, framed, in, bronze, those, of, the, pantheon, are, similar, in, design, with, narrow, horizontal, panels, in, addition, at, the, top, bottom, and, middle, two, other, bronze, doors, of, the, roman, period, are, in, the, lateran, basilica, the, greek, scholar, heron, of, alexandria, created, the, earliest, known, automatic, door, in, the, first, century, ad, during, the, era, of, roman, egypt, the, first, foot, sensor, activated, automatic, door, was, made, in, china, during, the, reign, of, emperor, yang, of, sui, r, 604, 618, who, had, one, installed, for, his, royal, library, gates, powered, by, water, featured, in, illustrations, of, the, automatons, of, the, arab, inventor, al, jazari, copper, and, its, alloys, were, integral, in, medieval, architecture, the, doors, of, the, church, of, the, nativity, at, bethlehem, 6th, century, are, covered, with, plates, of, bronze, cut, out, in, patterns, those, of, hagia, sophia, at, constantinople, of, the, eighth, and, ninth, century, are, wrought, in, bronze, and, the, west, doors, of, the, cathedral, of, aix, la, chapelle, 9th, century, of, similar, manufacture, were, probably, brought, from, constantinople, as, also, some, of, those, in, st, marks, venice, the, bronze, doors, on, the, aachen, cathedral, in, germany, date, back, to, about, 800, ad, bronze, baptistery, doors, at, the, cathedral, of, florence, were, completed, in, 1423, by, ghiberti, for, more, information, see, copper, in, architecture, of, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, there, are, numerous, examples, of, bronze, doors, the, earliest, being, one, at, hildesheim, germany, 1015, the, hildesheim, design, affected, the, concept, of, gniezno, door, in, poland, of, others, in, south, italy, and, sicily, the, following, are, the, finest, in, sant, andrea, amalfi, 1060, salerno, 1099, canosa, di, puglia, 1111, troia, two, doors, 1119, and, 1124, ravello, 1179, by, barisano, of, trani, who, also, made, doors, for, trani, cathedral, and, in, monreale, and, pisa, cathedrals, by, bonano, of, pisa, in, all, these, cases, the, hanging, stile, had, pivots, at, the, top, and, bottom, the, exact, period, when, the, builder, moved, to, the, hinge, is, unknown, but, the, change, apparently, brought, about, another, method, of, strengthening, and, decorating, doors, wrought, iron, bands, of, various, designs, as, a, rule, three, bands, with, ornamental, work, constitute, the, hinges, with, rings, outside, the, hanging, stiles, that, fit, on, vertical, tenons, set, into, the, masonry, or, wooden, frame, there, is, an, early, example, of, the, 12th, century, in, lincoln, in, france, the, metalwork, of, the, doors, of, notre, dame, at, paris, is, a, beautiful, example, but, many, others, exist, throughout, france, and, england, in, italy, celebrated, doors, include, those, of, the, battistero, di, san, giovanni, florence, which, are, all, in, bronze, including, the, door, frames, the, modeling, of, the, figures, birds, and, foliage, of, the, south, doorway, by, andrea, pisano, 1330, and, of, the, east, doorway, by, ghiberti, 1425, 1452, are, of, great, beauty, in, the, north, door, 1402, 1424, ghiberti, adopted, the, same, scheme, of, design, for, the, paneling, and, figure, subjects, as, andrea, pisano, but, in, the, east, door, the, rectangular, panels, are, all, filled, with, bas, reliefs, that, illustrate, scripture, subjects, and, innumerable, figures, these, may, the, gates, of, paradise, of, which, michelangelo, speaks, doors, of, the, mosques, in, cairo, were, of, two, kinds, those, externally, cased, with, sheets, of, bronze, or, iron, cut, in, decorative, patterns, and, incised, or, inlaid, with, bosses, in, relief, and, those, of, wood, framed, with, interlaced, square, and, diamond, designs, the, latter, design, is, coptic, in, origin, the, doors, of, the, palace, at, palermo, which, were, made, by, saracenic, workmen, for, the, normans, are, fine, examples, in, good, preservation, a, somewhat, similar, decorative, class, of, door, is, found, in, verona, where, the, edges, of, the, stiles, and, rails, are, beveled, and, notched, in, the, renaissance, period, italian, doors, are, quite, simple, their, architects, trusting, more, to, the, doorways, for, effect, but, in, france, and, germany, the, contrary, is, the, case, the, doors, being, elaborately, carved, especially, in, the, louis, xiv, and, louis, xv, periods, and, sometimes, with, architectural, features, such, as, columns, and, entablatures, with, pediment, and, niches, the, doorway, being, in, plain, masonry, while, in, italy, the, tendency, was, to, give, scale, by, increasing, the, number, of, panels, in, france, the, contrary, seems, to, have, been, the, rule, and, one, of, the, great, doors, at, fontainebleau, which, is, in, two, leaves, is, entirely, carried, out, as, if, consisting, of, one, great, panel, only, the, earliest, renaissance, doors, in, france, are, those, of, the, cathedral, of, st, sauveur, at, aix, 1503, in, the, lower, panels, there, are, figures, 3, ft, 0, 91, m, high, in, gothic, niches, and, in, the, upper, panels, a, double, range, of, niches, with, figures, about, 2, ft, 0, 61, m, high, with, canopies, over, them, all, carved, in, cedar, the, south, door, of, beauvais, cathedral, is, in, some, respects, the, finest, in, france, the, upper, panels, are, carved, in, high, relief, with, figure, subjects, and, canopies, over, them, the, doors, of, the, church, at, gisors, 1575, are, carved, with, figures, in, niches, subdivided, by, classic, pilasters, superimposed, in, st, maclou, at, rouen, are, three, magnificently, carved, doors, those, by, jean, goujon, have, figures, in, niches, on, each, side, and, others, in, a, group, of, great, beauty, in, the, center, the, other, doors, probably, about, forty, to, fifty, years, later, are, enriched, with, bas, reliefs, landscapes, figures, and, elaborate, interlaced, borders, nasa, s, vehicle, assembly, building, at, the, kennedy, space, center, contains, the, four, largest, doors, the, vehicle, assembly, building, was, originally, built, for, the, assembly, of, the, apollo, missions, saturn, vehicles, and, was, then, used, to, support, space, shuttle, operations, each, of, the, four, doors, are, 139, meters, 456, feet, high, the, oldest, door, in, england, can, be, found, in, westminster, abbey, and, dates, from, 1050, in, england, in, the, 17th, century, the, door, panels, were, raised, with, bolection, or, projecting, moldings, sometimes, richly, carved, around, them, in, the, 18th, century, the, moldings, worked, on, the, stiles, and, rails, were, carved, with, the, egg, and, dart, ornament, there, are, many, kinds, of, doors, with, different, purposes, most, doors, are, hinged, along, one, side, to, allow, the, door, to, pivot, away, from, the, doorway, in, one, direction, but, not, the, other, the, axis, of, rotation, is, usually, vertical, in, some, cases, such, as, hinged, garage, doors, the, axis, may, be, horizontal, above, the, door, opening, doors, can, be, hinged, so, that, the, axis, of, rotation, is, not, in, the, plane, of, the, door, to, reduce, the, space, required, on, the, side, to, which, the, door, opens, this, requires, a, mechanism, so, that, the, axis, of, rotation, is, on, the, side, other, than, that, in, which, the, door, opens, this, is, sometimes, the, case, in, trains, or, airplanes, such, as, for, the, door, to, the, toilet, which, opens, inward, it, is, often, useful, to, have, doors, which, slide, along, tracks, often, for, space, or, aesthetic, considerations, a, bypass, door, is, a, door, unit, that, has, two, or, more, sections, the, doors, can, slide, in, either, direction, along, one, axis, on, parallel, overhead, tracks, sliding, past, each, other, they, are, most, commonly, used, in, closets, to, provide, access, one, side, of, the, closet, at, a, time, doors, in, a, bypass, unit, overlap, slightly, when, viewed, from, the, front, so, they, do, not, have, a, visible, gap, when, closed, doors, which, slide, inside, a, wall, cavity, are, called, pocket, doors, this, type, of, door, is, used, in, tight, spaces, where, privacy, is, also, required, the, door, slab, is, mounted, to, roller, and, a, track, at, the, top, of, the, door, and, slides, inside, a, wall, sliding, glass, doors, are, common, in, many, houses, particularly, as, an, entrance, to, the, backyard, such, doors, are, also, popular, for, use, for, the, entrances, to, commercial, structures, although, they, are, not, counted, as, fire, exit, doors, the, door, that, moves, is, called, the, active, leaf, while, the, door, that, remains, fixed, is, called, the, inactive, leaf, a, high, speed, door, is, a, very, fast, door, some, with, opening, speeds, of, up, to, 4, m, s, mainly, used, in, the, industrial, sector, where, the, speed, of, a, door, has, an, effect, on, production, logistics, temperature, and, pressure, control, high, speed, cleanroom, doors, usually, consisting, of, a, transparent, material, on, a, stainless, steel, frame, are, used, in, pharmaceutical, industries, to, allow, passage, between, work, areas, while, admitting, minimal, contaminants, the, powerful, high, speed, doors, have, a, smooth, surface, structure, and, no, protruding, edges, allowing, minimal, particle, retention, and, easy, cleaning, high, speed, doors, are, made, to, handle, a, high, number, of, openings, generally, more, than, 200, 000, a, year, they, must, be, built, with, heavy, duty, parts, and, counterbalance, systems, for, speed, enhancement, and, emergency, opening, function, the, door, curtain, was, originally, made, of, pvc, but, was, later, also, developed, in, aluminium, and, acrylic, glass, sections, high, speed, refrigeration, and, cold, room, doors, with, excellent, insulation, values, have, also, been, introduced, for, green, and, energy, saving, requirements, in, north, america, the, door, and, access, systems, manufacturing, association, dasma, defines, high, performance, doors, as, non, residential, powered, doors, characterized, by, rolling, folding, sliding, or, swinging, action, that, are, either, high, cycle, minimum, 100, cycles, day, or, high, speed, minimum, 20, inches, 508, mm, second, and, two, out, of, three, of, the, following, made, to, order, for, exact, size, and, custom, features, able, to, withstand, equipment, impact, break, away, if, accidentally, hit, by, vehicle, or, able, to, sustain, heavy, use, with, minimal, maintenance, automatically, opening, doors, are, powered, open, and, closed, either, by, electricity, spring, or, both, there, are, several, methods, by, which, an, automatically, opening, door, is, activated, in, addition, to, activation, sensors, automatically, opening, doors, are, generally, fitted, with, safety, sensors, these, are, usually, an, infrared, curtain, or, beam, but, can, be, a, pressure, mat, fitted, on, the, swing, side, of, the, door, the, safety, sensor, prevents, the, door, from, colliding, with, an, object, by, stopping, or, slowing, its, motion, a, mechanism, in, modern, automatic, doors, ensures, that, the, door, can, open, in, a, power, failure, architectural, doors, have, numerous, general, and, specialized, uses, doors, are, generally, used, to, separate, interior, spaces, closets, rooms, etc, for, convenience, privacy, safety, and, security, reasons, doors, are, also, used, to, secure, passages, into, a, building, from, the, exterior, for, reasons, of, climate, control, and, safety, doors, also, are, applied, in, more, specialized, cases, panel, doors, also, called, stile, and, rail, doors, are, built, with, frame, and, panel, construction, en, 12519, is, describing, the, terms, which, are, officially, used, in, european, member, states, the,

the, panel, sizes, from, the, normative, size, being, different, single, door, vs, double, door, and, molded, vs, unmolded, doors, din, 18101, 1985, defines, interior, single, molded, doors, to, have, a, common, panel, height, of, 1985, mm, normativ, height, 2010, mm, at, panel, widths, of, 610, mm, 735, mm, 860, mm, 985, mm, 1110, mm, plus, a, larger, door, panel, size, of, 1110, mm, x, 2110, mm, the, newer, din, 18101, 2014, drops, the, definition, of, just, five, standard, door, sizes, in, favor, of, a, basic, raster, running, along, 125, mm, increments, where, the, height, and, width, are, independent, panel, width, may, be, in, the, range, 485, mm, to, 1360, mmm, and, the, height, may, be, in, the, range, of, 1610, mm, to, 2735, mm, the, most, common, interior, door, is, 860, mm, 1, 985, mm, 33, 9, in, 78, 1, in, when, framed, in, wood, for, snug, fitting, of, a, door, the, doorway, consists, of, two, vertical, jambs, on, either, side, a, lintel, or, head, jamb, at, the, top, and, perhaps, a, threshold, at, the, bottom, when, a, door, has, more, than, one, movable, section, one, of, the, sections, may, be, called, a, leaf, see, door, furniture, for, a, discussion, of, attachments, to, doors, such, as, door, handles, doorknobs, and, door, knockers, door, furniture, or, hardware, refers, to, any, of, the, items, that, are, attached, to, a, door, or, a, drawer, to, enhance, its, functionality, or, appearance, this, includes, items, such, as, hinges, handles, door, stops, etc, door, safety, relates, to, prevention, of, door, related, accidents, such, accidents, take, place, in, various, forms, and, in, a, number, of, locations, ranging, from, car, doors, to, garage, doors, accidents, vary, in, severity, and, frequency, according, to, the, national, safety, council, in, the, united, states, around, 300, 000, door, related, injuries, occur, every, year, the, types, of, accidents, vary, from, relatively, minor, cases, where, doors, cause, damage, to, other, objects, such, as, walls, to, serious, cases, resulting, in, human, injury, particularly, to, fingers, hands, and, feet, a, closing, door, can, exert, up, to, 40, tons, per, square, inch, of, pressure, between, the, hinges, because, of, the, number, of, accidents, taking, place, there, has, been, a, surge, in, the, number, of, lawsuits, thus, organisations, may, be, at, risk, when, car, doors, or, doors, within, buildings, are, unprotected, according, to, the, us, general, services, administration, discussing, child, care, centres, it, is, essential, that, children, s, fingers, be, protected, from, being, crushed, or, otherwise, injured, in, the, hinge, space, of, a, swinging, door, or, gate, there, are, simple, devices, available, to, attach, to, the, hinge, side, ensuring, that, this, type, of, injury, does, not, occur, as, the, door, closes, the, hand, is, pushed, out, of, the, opening, away, from, harm, in, addition, young, children, are, vulnerable, to, injury, when, they, fall, against, the, other, hinged, side, of, doors, and, gates, striking, projected, hinges, piano, hinges, are, not, recommended, to, alleviate, this, problem, as, they, tend, to, sag, over, time, with, heavy, use, instead, an, inexpensive, device, fitting, over, hinges, is, available, on, the, market, and, should, be, used, to, ensure, safety, whenever, a, door, is, opened, outward, there, is, a, risk, that, it, could, strike, another, person, in, many, cases, this, can, be, avoided, by, architectural, design, which, favors, doors, which, open, inward, to, rooms, from, the, perspective, of, a, common, area, such, as, a, corridor, the, door, opens, outward, in, cases, where, this, is, infeasible, it, may, be, possible, to, avoid, an, accident, by, placing, vision, panels, in, the, door, inward, hinged, doors, can, also, escalate, an, accident, by, preventing, people, from, escaping, the, building, people, inside, the, building, may, press, against, the, doors, and, thus, prevent, the, doors, from, opening, related, accidents, include, today, the, exterior, doors, of, most, large, especially, public, buildings, open, outward, while, interior, doors, such, as, doors, to, individual, rooms, offices, suites, etc, open, inward, as, do, many, exterior, doors, of, houses, particularly, in, north, america, doorstops, are, simple, devices, that, prevent, a, door, from, contacting, and, possibly, damaging, another, object, typically, a, wall, they, may, either, absorb, the, force, of, a, moving, door, or, hold, the, door, against, unintended, motion, door, guards, hinge, guards, anti, finger, trapping, devices, or, finger, guards, help, prevent, finger, trapping, accidents, as, doors, pose, a, risk, to, children, especially, when, closing, door, guards, protect, fingers, in, door, hinges, by, covering, the, hinge, side, gap, of, an, open, door, typically, with, a, piece, of, rubber, or, plastic, that, wraps, from, the, door, frame, to, the, door, other, door, safety, products, eject, the, fingers, from, the, push, side, of, the, door, as, it, closes, there, are, various, levels, of, door, protection, anti, finger, trapping, devices, in, front, may, leave, the, rear, hinge, pin, side, of, doors, unprotected, full, door, protection, uses, front, and, rear, anti, finger, trapping, devices, and, ensures, the, hinge, side, of, a, door, is, fully, isolated, a, risk, assessment, of, the, door, determines, the, appropriate, level, of, protection, there, is, also, handle, side, door, protection, which, prevents, the, door, from, slamming, shut, on, the, frame, which, can, cause, injury, to, fingers, hands, glass, doors, pose, the, risk, of, unintentional, collision, if, a, person, is, unaware, there, is, a, door, or, thinks, it, is, open, when, it, is, not, this, risk, is, greater, with, sliding, glass, doors, because, they, often, have, large, single, panes, that, are, hard, to, see, stickers, or, other, types, of, warnings, on, the, glass, surface, make, it, more, visible, and, help, prevent, injury, in, the, uk, regulation, 14, of, the, workplace, health, and, safety, regulations, 1992, requires, that, builders, mark, windows, and, glass, doors, to, make, them, conspicuous, australian, standards, as1288, and, as2208, require, that, glass, doors, be, made, of, laminated, tempered, or, toughened, glass, buildings, often, have, special, purpose, doors, that, automatically, close, to, prevent, the, spread, of, fire, and, smoke, fire, doors, that, are, improperly, installed, or, tampered, with, can, increase, risk, during, a, fire, sometimes, door, closer, mechanisms, ensure, fire, doors, remain, closed, an, additional, fire, risk, is, that, doors, may, prevent, access, to, emergency, services, personnel, coming, to, fight, the, fire, and, rescue, occupants, etc, fire, fighters, must, use, door, breaching, techniques, in, these, situations, to, gain, access, doors, in, public, buildings, often, have, panic, bars, which, open, the, door, in, response, to, anyone, pressing, against, the, bar, from, the, inside, in, the, event, of, a, fire, or, other, emergency, vehicle, doors, present, an, increased, risk, of, trapping, hands, or, fingers, due, to, the, proximity, of, occupants, bicyclists, cycling, on, public, roads, risk, dooring, collision, with, an, abruptly, opened, vehicle, door, because, cyclists, often, ride, near, parked, cars, alongside, the, road, they, are, particularly, vulnerable, in, aircraft, doors, in, a, pressurized, cabin, or, cargo, hold, could, pose, risk, if, they, open, during, flight, causing, decompression, air, may, rush, out, of, the, fuselage, with, sufficient, velocity, to, eject, unsecured, occupants, cargo, and, other, items, and, drastic, pressure, differences, between, compartments, may, cause, aircraft, floors, or, other, interior, partitions, to, fail, these, concerns, are, typically, mitigated, with, plug, doors, which, open, inward, they, are, secured, into, their, door, frames, by, the, difference, in, air, pressure, most, cabin, doors, and, emergency, exits, are, of, this, type, but, cargo, doors, typically, open, outward, to, maximise, interior, space, a, number, of, aircraft, accidents, have, involved, outward, opening, door, failures, including
