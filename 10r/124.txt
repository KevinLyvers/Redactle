the, process, of, circuit, design, can, cover, systems, ranging, from, complex, electronic, systems, down, to, the, individual, transistors, within, an, integrated, circuit, one, person, can, often, do, the, design, process, without, needing, a, planned, or, structured, design, process, for, simple, circuits, still, teams, of, designers, following, a, systematic, approach, with, intelligently, guided, computer, simulation, are, becoming, increasingly, common, for, more, complex, designs, in, integrated, circuit, design, automation, the, term, circuit, design, often, refers, to, the, step, of, the, design, cycle, which, outputs, the, schematics, of, the, integrated, circuit, typically, this, is, the, step, between, logic, design, and, physical, design, traditional, circuit, design, usually, involves, several, stages, sometimes, a, design, specification, is, written, after, liaising, with, the, customer, a, technical, proposal, may, be, written, to, meet, the, requirements, of, the, customer, specification, the, next, stage, involves, synthesising, on, paper, a, schematic, circuit, diagram, an, abstract, electrical, or, electronic, circuit, that, will, meet, the, specifications, a, calculation, of, the, component, values, to, meet, the, operating, specifications, under, specified, conditions, should, be, made, simulations, may, be, performed, to, verify, the, correctness, of, the, design, a, breadboard, or, other, prototype, version, of, the, design, for, testing, against, specification, may, be, built, it, may, involve, making, any, alterations, to, the, circuit, to, achieve, compliance, a, choice, as, to, a, method, of, construction, and, all, the, parts, and, materials, to, be, used, must, be, made, there, is, a, presentation, of, component, and, layout, information, to, draughtspersons, and, layout, and, mechanical, engineers, for, prototype, production, this, is, followed, by, the, testing, or, type, testing, several, prototypes, to, ensure, compliance, with, customer, requirements, usually, there, is, a, signing, and, approval, of, the, final, manufacturing, drawings, and, there, may, be, post, design, services, obsolescence, of, components, etc, the, process, of, circuit, design, begins, with, the, specification, which, states, the, functionality, that, the, finished, design, must, provide, but, does, not, indicate, how, it, is, to, be, achieved, the, initial, specification, is, a, technically, detailed, description, of, what, the, customer, wants, the, finished, circuit, to, achieve, and, can, include, a, variety, of, electrical, requirements, such, as, what, signals, the, circuit, will, receive, what, signals, it, must, output, what, power, supplies, are, available, and, how, much, power, it, is, permitted, to, consume, the, specification, can, and, normally, does, also, set, some, of, the, physical, parameters, that, the, design, must, meet, such, as, size, weight, moisture, resistance, temperature, range, thermal, output, vibration, tolerance, and, acceleration, tolerance, as, the, design, process, progresses, the, designer, s, will, frequently, return, to, the, specification, and, alter, it, to, take, account, of, the, progress, of, the, design, this, can, involve, tightening, specifications, that, the, customer, has, supplied, and, adding, tests, that, the, circuit, must, pass, to, be, accepted, these, additional, specifications, will, often, be, used, in, the, verification, of, a, design, changes, that, conflict, with, or, modify, the, customer, s, original, specifications, will, almost, always, have, to, be, approved, by, the, customer, before, they, can, be, acted, upon, correctly, identifying, the, customer, needs, can, avoid, a, condition, known, as, design, creep, which, occurs, in, the, absence, of, realistic, initial, expectations, and, later, by, failing, to, communicate, fully, with, the, client, during, the, design, process, it, can, be, defined, in, terms, of, its, results, at, one, extreme, is, a, circuit, with, more, functionality, than, necessary, and, at, the, other, is, a, circuit, having, an, incorrect, functionality, nevertheless, some, changes, can, be, expected, it, is, good, practice, to, keep, options, open, for, as, long, as, possible, because, it, s, easier, to, remove, spare, elements, from, the, circuit, later, on, than, it, is, to, put, them, in, the, design, process, involves, moving, from, the, specification, at, the, start, to, a, plan, that, contains, all, the, information, needed, to, be, physically, constructed, at, the, end, this, happens, typically, by, passing, through, several, stages, although, in, the, straightforward, circuit, it, may, be, done, in, a, single, step, the, process, usually, begins, with, the, conversion, of, the, specification, into, a, block, diagram, of, the, various, functions, that, the, circuit, must, perform, at, this, stage, the, contents, of, each, block, are, not, considered, only, what, each, block, must, do, this, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, black, box, design, this, approach, allows, the, possibly, highly, complex, task, to, be, broken, into, smaller, tasks, either, by, tackled, in, sequence, or, divided, amongst, members, of, a, design, team, each, block, is, then, considered, in, more, detail, still, at, an, abstract, stage, but, with, a, lot, more, focus, on, the, details, of, the, electrical, functions, to, be, provided, at, this, or, later, stages, it, is, common, to, require, a, large, amount, of, research, or, mathematical, modeling, into, what, is, and, is, not, feasible, to, achieve, the, results, of, this, research, may, be, fed, back, into, earlier, stages, of, the, design, process, for, example, if, it, turns, out, one, of, the, blocks, cannot, be, designed, within, the, parameters, set, for, it, it, may, be, necessary, to, alter, other, blocks, instead, at, this, point, it, is, also, common, to, start, considering, both, how, to, demonstrate, that, the, design, does, meet, the, specifications, and, how, it, is, to, be, tested, which, can, include, self, diagnostic, tools, finally, the, individual, circuit, components, are, chosen, to, carry, out, each, function, in, the, overall, design, at, this, stage, the, physical, layout, and, electrical, connections, of, each, component, are, also, decided, this, layout, commonly, taking, the, form, of, artwork, for, the, production, of, a, printed, circuit, board, or, integrated, circuit, this, stage, is, typically, highly, time, consuming, because, of, the, vast, array, of, choices, available, a, practical, constraint, on, the, design, at, this, stage, is, standardization, at, the, same, time, a, certain, value, of, a, component, may, be, calculated, for, use, in, some, location, in, a, circuit, if, that, value, cannot, be, purchased, from, a, supplier, then, the, problem, has, still, not, been, solved, to, avoid, this, a, certain, amount, of, catalog, engineering, can, be, applied, to, solve, the, more, mundane, tasks, within, an, overall, design, one, area, of, rapid, technology, development, is, in, the, field, of, nanoelectronic, circuit, design, generally, the, cost, of, designing, circuits, is, directly, tied, to, the, final, circuits, complexity, the, greater, the, complexity, quantity, of, components, and, design, novelty, the, more, hours, of, a, skilled, engineer, s, time, will, be, necessary, to, create, a, functional, product, the, process, can, be, tedious, as, minute, details, or, features, could, take, any, amount, of, time, materials, and, manpower, to, create, like, taking, into, account, the, effects, of, modifying, transistor, sizes, or, codecs, in, the, world, of, flexible, electronics, replacing, the, widely, used, polyimide, substrates, with, materials, like, pen, or, pet, to, produce, flexible, electronics, could, reduce, costs, by, factors, of, 5, 10, costs, for, designing, a, circuit, are, almost, always, far, higher, than, production, costs, per, unit, as, the, cost, of, production, and, function, of, the, circuit, depends, greatly, on, the, design, of, the, circuit, although, the, typical, pcb, production, methods, involve, subtractive, manufacturing, there, are, methods, that, use, an, additive, manufacturing, process, such, as, using, a, 3d, printer, to, print, a, pcb, this, method, is, thought, to, cost, less, than, additive, manufacturing, and, eliminates, the, need, for, waste, management, altogether, once, a, circuit, has, been, designed, it, must, be, both, verified, and, tested, verification, is, the, process, of, going, through, each, stage, of, a, design, and, ensuring, that, it, will, do, what, the, specification, requires, it, to, do, this, is, frequently, a, highly, mathematical, process, and, can, involve, large, scale, computer, simulations, of, the, design, in, any, complicated, design, it, is, very, likely, that, problems, will, be, found, at, this, stage, and, may, affect, a, large, amount, of, the, design, work, to, be, redone, to, fix, them, testing, is, the, real, world, counterpart, to, verification, testing, involves, physically, building, at, least, a, prototype, of, the, design, and, then, in, combination, with, the, test, procedures, in, the, specification, or, added, to, it, checking, the, circuit, does, what, it, was, designed, to, in, the, software, of, the, visual, dsd, the, logic, circuit, of, complement, circuit, is, implemented, by, the, compiling, program, code, these, types, of, software, programs, are, creating, cheaper, more, efficient, circuits, for, all, types, of, circuits, we, have, implemented, functional, simulations, to, verify, logic, functions, corresponding, to, logic, expressions, in, our, proposed, circuits, the, proposed, architectures, are, modeled, in, vhdl, language, using, this, language, will, create, more, efficient, circuits, that, will, not, only, be, cheaper, but, last, longer, these, are, only, two, of, many, design, software, that, help, individuals, plan, there, circuits, for, production, prototyping, plays, a, significant, role, in, the, complex, process, of, circuit, design, this, iterative, process, involves, continuous, refinement, and, correction, of, errors, the, task, of, circuit, design, is, demanding, and, requires, meticulous, attention, to, detail, to, avoid, errors, circuit, designers, are, required, to, conduct, multiple, tests, to, ensure, the, efficiency, and, safety, of, their, designs, before, they, are, deemed, suitable, for, consumer, use, prototyping, is, an, integral, part, of, electrical, work, due, to, its, precise, and, meticulous, nature, the, absence, of, prototyping, could, potentially, lead, to, errors, in, the, final, product, circuit, designers, who, are, compensated, for, their, expertise, in, creating, electrical, circuits, bear, the, responsibility, of, ensuring, the, safety, of, consumers, who, purchase, and, use, these, circuits, at, home, the, risks, associated, with, neglecting, the, prototyping, process, and, releasing, a, flawed, electrical, circuit, are, significant, these, risks, include, the, potential, for, fires, and, overheated, wires, which, could, result, in, burns, or, severe, injuries, to, unsuspecting, individuals, every, electrical, circuit, starts, with, a, circuit, board, simulator, of, how, the, things, will, be, put, together, at, the, end, of, the, day, and, show, how, the, circuit, will, work, virtually, a, blueprint, is, the, drawing, of, the, technical, design, and, final, product, after, all, this, is, done, and, you, use, the, blueprint, to, put, the, circuit, together, you, will, get, the, results, of, electrical, circuits, that, are, quite, memorable, the, circuit, will, run, anything, from, a, vacuum, to, a, big, tv, in, a, movie, theater, all, of, these, take, a, long, time, and, a, certain, skill, not, everyone, can, acquire, the, electrical, circuit, is, something, most, things, we, need, in, our, everyday, lives, any, commercial, design, will, normally, also, include, an, element, of, documentation, the, precise, nature, of, this, documentation, will, vary, according, to, the, size, and, complexity, of, the, circuit, and, the, country, in, which, it, is, to, be, used, as, a, bare, minimum, the, documentation, will, normally, include, at, least, the, specification, and, testing, procedures, for, the, design, and, a, statement, of, compliance, with, current, regulations, in, the, eu, this, last, item, will, normally, take, the, form, of, a, ce, declaration, listing, the, european, directives, complied, with, and, naming, an, individual, responsible, for, compliance
