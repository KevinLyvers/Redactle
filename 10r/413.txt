an, irrigation, sprinkler, also, known, as, a, water, sprinkler, or, simply, a, sprinkler, is, a, device, used, to, irrigate, water, agricultural, crops, lawns, landscapes, golf, courses, and, other, areas, they, are, also, used, for, cooling, and, for, the, control, of, airborne, dust, sprinkler, irrigation, is, the, method, of, applying, water, in, a, controlled, manner, in, way, similar, to, rainfall, the, water, is, distributed, through, a, network, that, may, consist, of, pumps, valves, pipes, and, sprinklers, irrigation, sprinklers, can, be, used, for, residential, industrial, and, agricultural, usage, it, is, useful, on, uneven, land, where, sufficient, water, is, not, available, as, well, as, on, sandy, soil, the, perpendicular, pipes, having, rotating, nozzles, on, top, are, joined, to, the, main, pipeline, at, regular, intervals, when, water, is, pressurized, through, the, main, pipe, it, escapes, from, the, rotating, nozzles, it, gets, sprinkled, on, the, crop, in, sprinkler, or, overhead, irrigation, water, is, piped, to, one, more, central, locations, within, the, field, and, distributed, by, overhead, high, pressure, sprinklers, or, guns, rotating, sprinkler, heads, for, higher, pressures, are, driven, by, a, ball, drive, gear, drive, or, impact, mechanisms, they, can, be, designed, to, rotate, in, a, full, or, partial, circle, rainguns, are, similar, to, impact, sprinklers, except, that, they, generally, operate, at, very, high, pressures, of, 2, 8, to, 9, 0, bar, 280, to, 900, kpa, 40, to, 130, lbf, in, 2, and, flows, of, 3, to, 76, l, s, 50, to, 1, 200, us, gal, min, usually, with, nozzle, diameters, in, the, range, of, 10, to, 50, mm, 0, 5, to, 1, 9, in, in, addition, to, irrigation, guns, are, used, for, industrial, applications, such, as, dust, suppression, and, logging, many, irrigation, sprinklers, are, buried, in, the, ground, along, with, their, supporting, plumbing, although, above, ground, and, moving, sprinklers, are, also, common, most, irrigation, sprinklers, operate, through, electric, and, hydraulic, technology, and, are, grouped, together, in, zones, that, can, be, collectively, turned, on, and, off, by, actuating, a, solenoid, valve, home, lawn, sprinklers, vary, widely, in, their, size, cost, and, complexity, they, include, impact, sprinklers, oscillating, sprinklers, drip, sprinklers, underground, sprinkler, systems, and, portable, sprinklers, permanently, installed, systems, may, often, operate, on, timers, or, other, automated, processes, they, are, occasionally, installed, with, retractable, heads, for, aesthetic, and, practical, reasons, reducing, damage, during, lawn, mowing, these, types, of, systems, usually, can, be, programmed, to, start, automatically, on, a, set, time, and, day, each, week, small, portable, sprinklers, can, be, placed, temporarily, on, lawns, if, additional, watering, is, needed, or, if, no, permanent, system, is, in, place, these, are, often, attached, to, an, outdoor, water, faucet, and, are, placed, for, a, short, period, of, time, other, systems, may, be, professionally, installed, permanently, in, the, ground, and, are, attached, permanently, to, a, home, s, plumbing, system, an, antique, sprinkler, developed, by, nomad, called, a, set, and, forget, tractor, sprinkler, was, used, in, australia, in, the, 1950s, water, pressure, ensured, that, the, sprinkler, moved, slowly, across, a, lawn, the, first, use, of, sprinklers, by, farmers, was, some, form, of, home, and, golf, course, type, sprinklers, these, ad, hoc, systems, while, doing, the, job, of, the, buried, pipes, and, fixed, sprinkler, heads, interfered, with, cultivation, and, were, expensive, to, maintain, center, pivot, irrigation, was, invented, in, 1940, by, farmer, frank, zybach, who, lived, in, strasburg, colorado, in, the, 1950s, stout, wyss, irrigation, system, a, firm, based, in, portland, oregon, developed, a, rolling, pipe, type, irrigation, system, for, farms, that, has, become, the, most, popular, type, for, farmers, irrigating, large, fields, with, this, system, large, wheels, attached, to, the, large, pipes, with, sprinkler, heads, move, slowly, across, the, field, underground, sprinklers, function, through, means, of, basic, electronic, and, hydraulic, technology, this, valve, and, all, of, the, sprinklers, that, will, be, activated, by, this, valve, are, known, as, a, zone, upon, activation, the, solenoid, which, sits, on, top, of, the, valve, is, magnetized, lifting, a, small, stainless, steel, plunger, in, its, center, by, doing, this, the, activated, or, raised, plunger, allows, water, to, escape, from, the, top, of, a, rubber, diaphragm, located, in, the, center, of, the, valve, water, that, has, been, charged, and, waiting, on, the, bottom, of, this, same, diaphragm, now, has, the, higher, pressure, and, lifts, the, diaphragm, this, pressurized, water, is, then, allowed, to, escape, down, stream, of, the, valve, through, a, series, of, pipes, usually, made, of, pvc, higher, pressure, commercial, systems, or, polyethylene, pipe, for, typically, lower, pressure, residential, systems, at, the, end, of, these, pipes, and, flush, to, ground, level, typically, are, pre, measured, and, spaced, out, sprinklers, these, sprinklers, can, be, fixed, spray, heads, that, have, a, set, pattern, and, generally, spray, between, 1, 5, and, 2, m, 5, and, 7, ft, full, rotating, sprinklers, that, can, spray, a, broken, stream, of, water, from, 6, to, 12, m, 20, to, 40, ft, or, small, drip, emitters, that, release, a, slow, steady, drip, of, water, on, more, delicate, plants, such, as, flowers, and, shrubs, use, of, indigenous, materials, also, recommended, in, 2017, it, was, reported, that, use, of, common, garden, hoses, in, combination, with, spray, nozzles, may, generate, aerosols, containing, droplets, smaller, than, 10, m, 0, 39, mils, which, can, be, inhaled, by, nearby, people, water, stagnating, in, a, hose, between, uses, especially, when, warmed, by, the, sun, can, host, the, growth, and, interaction, of, legionella, and, free, living, amoebae, fla, as, biofilms, on, the, inner, surface, of, the, hose, clinical, cases, of, legionnaires, disease, or, pontiac, fever, have, been, found, to, be, associated, with, inhalation, of, garden, hose, aerosols, containing, legionella, bacteria, the, report, provides, measured, microbial, densities, resulting, from, controlled, hose, conditions, in, order, to, quantify, the, human, health, risks, the, densities, of, legionella, spp, identified, in, two, types, of, hoses, were, found, to, be, similar, to, those, reported, during, legionellosis, outbreaks, from, other, causes, it, has, been, proposed, to, mitigate, the, risk, by, draining, hoses, after, use
