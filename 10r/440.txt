an, image, is, a, visual, representation, an, image, can, be, two, dimensional, such, as, a, drawing, painting, or, photograph, or, three, dimensional, such, as, a, carving, or, sculpture, images, may, be, displayed, through, other, media, including, a, projection, on, a, surface, activation, of, electronic, signals, or, digital, displays, they, can, also, be, reproduced, through, mechanical, means, such, as, photography, printmaking, or, photocopying, images, can, also, be, animated, through, digital, or, physical, processes, in, the, context, of, signal, processing, an, image, is, a, distributed, amplitude, of, color, s, in, optics, the, term, image, or, optical, image, refers, specifically, to, the, reproduction, of, an, object, formed, by, light, waves, coming, from, the, object, a, volatile, image, exists, or, is, perceived, only, for, a, short, period, this, may, be, a, reflection, of, an, object, by, a, mirror, a, projection, of, a, camera, obscura, or, a, scene, displayed, on, a, cathode, ray, tube, a, fixed, image, also, called, a, hard, copy, is, one, that, has, been, recorded, on, a, material, object, such, as, paper, or, textile, a, mental, image, exists, in, an, individual, s, mind, as, something, one, remembers, or, imagines, the, subject, of, an, image, does, not, need, to, be, real, it, may, be, an, abstract, concept, such, as, a, graph, or, function, or, an, imaginary, entity, for, a, mental, image, to, be, understood, outside, of, an, individual, s, mind, however, there, must, be, a, way, of, conveying, that, mental, image, through, the, words, or, visual, productions, of, the, subject, the, broader, sense, of, the, word, image, also, encompasses, any, two, dimensional, figure, such, as, a, map, graph, pie, chart, painting, or, banner, in, this, wider, sense, images, can, also, be, rendered, manually, such, as, by, drawing, the, art, of, painting, or, the, graphic, arts, such, as, lithography, or, etching, additionally, images, can, be, rendered, automatically, through, printing, computer, graphics, technology, or, a, combination, of, both, methods, a, two, dimensional, image, does, not, need, to, use, the, entire, visual, system, to, be, a, visual, representation, an, example, of, this, is, a, grayscale, black, and, white, image, which, uses, the, visual, system, s, sensitivity, to, brightness, across, all, wavelengths, without, taking, into, account, different, colors, a, black, and, white, visual, representation, of, something, is, still, an, image, even, though, it, does, not, fully, use, the, visual, system, s, capabilities, on, the, other, hand, some, processes, can, be, used, to, create, visual, representations, of, objects, that, are, otherwise, inaccessible, to, the, human, visual, system, these, include, microscopy, for, the, magnification, of, minute, objects, telescopes, that, can, observe, objects, at, great, distances, x, rays, that, can, visually, represent, the, interior, structures, of, the, human, body, among, other, objects, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, positron, emission, tomography, pet, scans, and, others, such, processes, often, rely, on, detecting, electromagnetic, radiation, that, occurs, beyond, the, light, spectrum, visible, to, the, human, eye, and, converting, such, signals, into, recognizable, images, aside, from, sculpture, and, other, physical, activities, that, can, create, three, dimensional, images, from, solid, material, some, modern, techniques, such, as, holography, can, create, three, dimensional, images, that, are, reproducible, but, intangible, to, human, touch, some, photographic, processes, can, now, render, the, illusion, of, depth, in, an, otherwise, flat, image, but, 3, d, photography, stereoscopy, or, 3, d, film, are, optical, illusions, that, require, special, devices, such, as, eyeglasses, to, create, that, illusion, of, depth, copies, of, 3, dimensional, images, have, traditionally, had, to, be, crafted, one, at, a, time, usually, by, an, individual, or, team, of, artisans, in, the, modern, age, the, development, of, plastics, and, other, technologies, made, it, possible, to, create, multiple, copies, of, a, 3, dimensional, object, with, less, effort, the, advent, and, development, of, 3, d, printing, have, expanded, that, capability, moving, two, dimensional, images, are, actually, illusions, of, movement, perceived, when, still, images, are, displayed, in, sequence, each, image, lasting, less, and, sometimes, much, less, than, a, fraction, of, a, second, the, traditional, standard, for, the, display, of, individual, frames, by, a, motion, picture, projector, has, been, 24, frames, per, second, fps, since, at, least, the, commercial, introduction, of, talking, pictures, in, the, late, 1920s, which, necessitated, a, standard, for, synchronizing, images, and, sounds, even, in, electronic, formats, such, as, television, and, digital, image, displays, the, apparent, motion, is, actually, the, result, of, many, individual, lines, giving, the, impression, of, continuous, movement, this, phenomenon, has, often, been, described, as, persistence, of, vision, a, physiological, effect, of, light, impressions, remaining, on, the, retina, of, the, eye, for, very, brief, periods, even, though, the, term, is, still, sometimes, used, in, popular, discussions, of, movies, it, is, not, a, scientifically, valid, explanation, other, terms, emphasize, the, complex, cognitive, operations, of, the, brain, and, the, human, visual, system, flicker, fusion, the, phi, phenomenon, and, beta, movement, are, among, the, terms, that, have, replaced, persistence, of, vision, though, no, one, term, seems, adequate, to, describe, the, process, image, making, seems, to, have, been, common, to, virtually, all, human, cultures, since, at, least, the, paleolithic, era, prehistoric, examples, of, rock, art, including, cave, paintings, petroglyphs, rock, reliefs, and, geoglyphs, have, been, found, on, every, inhabited, continent, many, of, these, images, seem, to, have, served, various, purposes, as, a, form, of, record, keeping, as, an, element, of, spiritual, religious, or, magical, practice, or, even, as, a, form, of, communication, early, writing, systems, including, hieroglyphics, ideographic, writing, and, even, the, roman, alphabet, owe, their, origins, in, some, respects, to, pictorial, representations, images, of, any, type, may, convey, different, meanings, and, sensations, for, individual, viewers, regardless, of, whether, the, image, s, creator, intended, them, an, image, may, be, taken, simply, as, a, more, or, less, accurate, copy, of, a, person, place, thing, or, event, it, may, represent, an, abstract, concept, such, as, the, political, power, of, a, ruler, or, ruling, class, a, practical, or, moral, lesson, an, object, for, spiritual, or, religious, veneration, or, an, object, human, or, otherwise, to, be, desired, it, may, also, be, regarded, for, its, purely, aesthetic, qualities, rarity, or, monetary, value, such, reactions, can, depend, on, the, viewer, s, context, a, religious, image, in, a, church, may, be, regarded, differently, than, the, same, image, mounted, in, a, museum, some, might, view, it, simply, as, an, object, to, be, bought, or, sold, viewers, reactions, will, also, be, guided, or, shaped, by, their, education, class, race, and, other, contexts, the, study, of, emotional, sensations, and, their, relationship, to, the, image, falls, into, the, categories, of, aesthetics, and, the, philosophy, of, art, while, such, studies, inevitably, deal, with, issues, of, meaning, another, approach, to, signification, was, suggested, by, the, american, philosopher, logician, and, semiotician, charles, sanders, peirce, images, are, one, type, of, the, broad, category, of, signs, proposed, by, peirce, although, his, ideas, are, complex, and, have, changed, over, time, the, three, categories, of, signs, that, he, distinguished, stand, out, a, single, image, may, exist, in, all, three, categories, at, the, same, time, the, statue, of, liberty, provides, an, example, while, there, have, been, countless, two, dimensional, and, three, dimensional, reproductions, of, the, statue, i, e, icons, themselves, the, statue, itself, exists, as, the, nature, of, images, whether, three, dimensional, or, two, dimensional, created, for, a, specific, purpose, or, only, for, aesthetic, pleasure, has, continued, to, provoke, questions, and, even, condemnation, at, different, times, and, places, in, his, dialogue, the, republic, the, greek, philosopher, plato, described, our, apparent, reality, as, a, copy, of, a, higher, order, of, universal, forms, as, copies, of, a, higher, reality, the, things, we, perceive, in, the, world, tangible, or, abstract, are, inevitably, imperfect, book, 7, of, the, republic, offers, plato, s, allegory, of, the, cave, where, ordinary, human, life, is, compared, to, being, a, prisoner, in, a, darkened, cave, who, believes, that, shadows, projected, onto, the, cave, s, wall, comprise, actual, reality, since, art, is, itself, an, imitation, it, is, a, copy, of, that, copy, and, all, the, more, imperfect, artistic, images, then, not, only, misdirect, human, reason, away, from, understanding, the, higher, forms, of, true, reality, but, in, imitating, the, bad, behaviors, of, humans, in, depictions, of, the, gods, they, can, corrupt, individuals, and, society, echoes, of, such, criticism, have, persisted, across, time, accelerating, as, image, making, technologies, have, developed, and, expanded, immensely, since, the, invention, of, the, daguerreotype, and, other, photographic, processes, in, the, mid, 19th, century, by, the, late, 20th, century, works, like, john, berger, s, ways, of, seeing, and, susan, sontag, s, on, photography, questioned, the, hidden, assumptions, of, power, race, sex, and, class, encoded, in, even, realistic, images, and, how, those, assumptions, and, how, such, images, may, implicate, the, viewer, in, the, voyeuristic, position, of, a, usually, male, viewer, the, documentary, film, scholar, bill, nichols, has, also, studied, how, apparently, objective, photographs, and, films, still, encode, assumptions, about, their, subjects, images, perpetuated, in, public, education, media, and, popular, culture, have, a, profound, impact, on, the, formation, of, such, mental, images, what, makes, them, so, powerful, is, that, they, circumvent, the, faculties, of, the, conscious, mind, but, instead, directly, target, the, subconscious, and, affective, thus, evading, direct, inquiry, through, contemplative, reasoning, by, doing, so, such, axiomatic, images, let, us, know, what, we, shall, desire, liberalism, in, a, snapshot, the, crunchy, honey, flavored, cereals, and, the, freshly, pressed, orange, juice, in, the, back, of, a, suburban, one, family, home, and, from, what, we, shall, obstain, communism, in, a, snapshot, lifeless, crowds, of, men, and, machinery, marching, towards, certain, perdition, accompanied, by, the, tunes, of, soviet, russian, songs, what, makes, those, images, so, powerful, is, that, it, is, only, of, relative, minor, relevance, for, the, stabilization, of, such, images, whether, they, actually, capture, and, correspond, with, the, multiple, layers, of, reality, or, not, despite, or, perhaps, because, of, the, widespread, use, of, religious, and, spiritual, imagery, worldwide, the, making, of, images, and, the, depiction, of, gods, or, religious, subjects, has, been, subject, to, criticism, censorship, and, criminal, penalties, the, abrahamic, religions, judaism, christianity, and, islam, all, have, had, admonitions, against, the, making, of, images, even, though, the, extent, of, that, proscription, has, varied, with, time, place, and, sect, or, denomination, of, a, given, religion, in, judaism, one, of, the, ten, commandments, given, by, god, to, moses, on, mount, sinai, forbids, the, making, of, any, graven, image, or, any, likeness, that, in, heaven, above, or, that, in, the, earth, beneath, or, that, in, the, water, under, earth, in, christian, history, periods, of, iconoclasm, the, destruction, of, images, especially, those, with, religious, meanings, or, connotations, have, broken, out, from, time, to, time, and, some, sects, and, denominations, have, rejected, or, severely, limited, the, use, of, religious, imagery, islam, tends, to, discourage, religious, depictions, sometimes, quite, rigorously, and, often, extends, that, to, other, forms, of, realistic, imagery, favoring, calligraphy, or, geometric, designs, instead, depending, on, time, and, place, photographs, and, broadcast, images, in, islamic, societies, may, be, less, subject, to, outright, prohibition, in, any, religion, restrictions, on, image, making, are, especially, targeted, to, avoid, depictions, of, false, gods, in, the, form, of, idols, in, recent, years, militant, extremist, groups, such, as, the, taliban, and, isis, have, destroyed, centuries, old, artifacts, especially, those, associated, with, other, religions, virtually, all, cultures, have, produced, images, and, applied, different, meanings, or, applications, to, them, the, loss, of, knowledge, about, the, context, and, connection, of, an, image, to, its, object, is, likely, to, result, in, different, perceptions, and, interpretations, of, the, image, and, even, of, the, original, object, itself, through, human, history, one, dominant, form, of, such, images, has, been, in, relation, to, religion, and, spirituality, such, images, whether, in, the, form, of, idols, that, are, objects, of, worship, or, that, represent, some, other, spiritual, state, or, quality, have, a, different, status, as, artifacts, when, copies, of, such, images, sever, links, to, the, spiritual, or, supernatural, the, german, philosopher, and, essayist, walter, benjamin, brought, particular, attention, to, this, point, in, his, 1935, essay, the, work, of, art, in, the, age, of, mechanical, reproduction, benjamin, argues, that, the, mechanical, reproduction, of, images, which, had, accelerated, through, photographic, processes, in, the, previous, one, hundred, years, or, so, inevitably, degrades, the, authenticity, or, quasi, religious, aura, of, the, original, object, one, example, is, leonardo, da, vinci, s, mona, lisa, originally, painted, as, a, portrait, but, much, later, with, its, display, as, an, art, object, it, developed, a, cult, value, as, an, example, of, artistic, beauty, following, years, of, various, reproductions, of, the, painting, the, portrait, s, cult, status, has, little, to, do, with, its, original, subject, or, the, artistry, it, has, become, famous, for, being, famous, while, at, the, same, time, its, recognizability, has, made, it, a, subject, to, be, copied, manipulated, satirized, or, otherwise, altered, in, forms, ranging, from, marcel, duchamp, s, l, h, o, o, q, to, andy, warhol, s, multiple, silk, screened, reproductions, of, the, image, in, modern, times, the, development, of, non, fungible, tokens, nfts, has, been, touted, as, an, attempt, to, create, authentic, or, unique, images, that, have, a, monetary, value, existing, only, in, digital, format, this, assumption, has, been, widely, debated, the, development, of, synthetic, acoustic, technologies, and, the, creation, of, sound, art, have, led, to, considering, the, possibilities, of, a, sound, image, made, up, of, irreducible, phonic, substance, beyond, linguistic, or, musicological, analysis, a, still, image, is, a, single, static, image, this, phrase, is, used, in, photography, visual, media, and, the, computer, industry, to, emphasize, that, one, is, not, talking, about, movies, or, in, very, precise, or, pedantic, technical, writing, such, as, a, standard, a, moving, image, is, typically, a, movie, film, or, video, including, digital, video, it, could, also, be, an, animated, display, such, as, a, zoetrope, a, still, frame, is, a, still, image, derived, from, one, frame, of, a, moving, one, in, contrast, a, film, still, is, a, photograph, taken, on, the, set, of, a, movie, or, television, program, during, production, used, for, promotional, purposes, in, image, processing, a, picture, function, is, a, mathematical, representation, of, a, two, dimensional, image, as, a, function, of, two, spatial, variables, the, function, f, x, y, describes, the, intensity, of, the, point, at, coordinates, x, y, in, literature, a, mental, image, may, be, developed, through, words, and, phrases, to, which, the, senses, respond, it, involves, picturing, an, image, mentally, also, called, imagining, hence, imagery, it, can, both, be, figurative, and, literal
