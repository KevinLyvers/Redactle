smelting, is, a, process, of, applying, heat, and, a, chemical, reducing, agent, to, an, ore, to, extract, a, desired, base, metal, product, it, is, a, form, of, extractive, metallurgy, that, is, used, to, obtain, many, metals, such, as, iron, copper, silver, tin, lead, and, zinc, smelting, uses, heat, and, a, chemical, reducing, agent, to, decompose, the, ore, driving, off, other, elements, as, gases, or, slag, and, leaving, the, metal, behind, the, reducing, agent, is, commonly, a, fossil, fuel, source, of, carbon, such, as, carbon, monoxide, from, incomplete, combustion, of, coke, or, in, earlier, times, of, charcoal, the, oxygen, in, the, ore, binds, to, carbon, at, high, temperatures, as, the, chemical, potential, energy, of, the, bonds, in, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, is, lower, than, that, of, the, bonds, in, the, ore, sulfide, ores, such, as, those, commonly, used, to, obtain, copper, zinc, or, lead, are, roasted, before, smelting, in, order, to, convert, the, sulfides, to, oxides, which, are, more, readily, reduced, to, the, metal, roasting, heats, the, ore, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, from, air, oxidizing, the, ore, and, liberating, the, sulfur, as, sulfur, dioxide, gas, smelting, most, prominently, takes, place, in, a, blast, furnace, to, produce, pig, iron, which, is, converted, into, steel, plants, for, the, electrolytic, reduction, of, aluminium, are, referred, to, as, aluminium, smelters, smelting, involves, more, than, just, melting, the, metal, out, of, its, ore, most, ores, are, the, chemical, compound, of, the, metal, and, other, elements, such, as, oxygen, as, an, oxide, sulfur, as, a, sulfide, or, carbon, and, oxygen, together, as, a, carbonate, to, extract, the, metal, workers, must, make, these, compounds, undergo, a, chemical, reaction, smelting, therefore, consists, of, using, suitable, reducing, substances, that, combine, with, those, oxidizing, elements, to, free, the, metal, in, the, case, of, sulfides, and, carbonates, a, process, called, roasting, removes, the, unwanted, carbon, or, sulfur, leaving, an, oxide, which, can, be, directly, reduced, roasting, is, usually, carried, out, in, an, oxidizing, environment, a, few, practical, examples, reduction, is, the, final, high, temperature, step, in, smelting, in, which, the, oxide, becomes, the, elemental, metal, a, reducing, environment, often, provided, by, carbon, monoxide, made, by, incomplete, combustion, in, an, air, starved, furnace, pulls, the, final, oxygen, atoms, from, the, raw, metal, the, carbon, source, acts, as, a, chemical, reactant, to, remove, oxygen, from, the, ore, yielding, the, purified, metal, element, as, a, product, the, carbon, source, is, oxidized, in, two, stages, first, carbon, c, combusts, with, oxygen, o, 2, in, the, air, to, produce, carbon, monoxide, co, second, the, carbon, monoxide, reacts, with, the, ore, e, g, fe, 2, o, 3, and, removes, one, of, its, oxygen, atoms, releasing, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, after, successive, interactions, with, carbon, monoxide, all, of, the, oxygen, in, the, ore, will, be, removed, leaving, the, raw, metal, element, e, g, fe, as, most, ores, are, impure, it, is, often, necessary, to, use, flux, such, as, limestone, or, dolomite, to, remove, the, accompanying, rock, gangue, as, slag, this, calcination, reaction, emits, carbon, dioxide, the, required, temperature, varies, both, in, absolute, terms, and, in, terms, of, the, melting, point, of, the, base, metal, examples, fluxes, are, materials, added, to, the, ore, during, smelting, to, catalyze, the, desired, reactions, and, to, chemically, bind, to, unwanted, impurities, or, reaction, products, calcium, carbonate, or, calcium, oxide, in, the, form, of, lime, are, often, used, for, this, purpose, since, they, react, with, sulfur, phosphorus, and, silicon, impurities, to, allow, them, to, be, readily, separated, and, discarded, in, the, form, of, slag, fluxes, may, also, serve, to, control, the, viscosity, and, neutralize, unwanted, acids, flux, and, slag, can, provide, a, secondary, service, after, the, reduction, step, is, complete, they, provide, a, molten, cover, on, the, purified, metal, preventing, contact, with, oxygen, while, still, hot, enough, to, readily, oxidize, this, prevents, impurities, from, forming, in, the, metal, the, ores, of, base, metals, are, often, sulfides, in, recent, centuries, reverberatory, furnaces, have, been, used, to, keep, the, charge, being, smelted, separately, from, the, fuel, traditionally, they, were, used, for, the, first, step, of, smelting, forming, two, liquids, one, an, oxide, slag, containing, most, of, the, impurities, and, the, other, a, sulfide, matte, containing, the, valuable, metal, sulfide, and, some, impurities, such, reverb, furnaces, are, today, about, 40, meters, long, 3, meters, high, and, 10, meters, wide, fuel, is, burned, at, one, end, to, melt, the, dry, sulfide, concentrates, usually, after, partial, roasting, which, are, fed, through, openings, in, the, roof, of, the, furnace, the, slag, floats, over, the, heavier, matte, and, is, removed, and, discarded, or, recycled, the, sulfide, matte, is, then, sent, to, the, converter, the, precise, details, of, the, process, vary, from, one, furnace, to, another, depending, on, the, mineralogy, of, the, ore, body, while, reverberatory, furnaces, produced, slags, containing, very, little, copper, they, were, relatively, energy, inefficient, and, off, gassed, a, low, concentration, of, sulfur, dioxide, that, was, difficult, to, capture, a, new, generation, of, copper, smelting, technologies, has, supplanted, them, more, recent, furnaces, exploit, bath, smelting, top, jetting, lance, smelting, flash, smelting, and, blast, furnaces, some, examples, of, bath, smelters, include, the, noranda, furnace, the, isasmelt, furnace, the, teniente, reactor, the, vunyukov, smelter, and, the, sks, technology, top, jetting, lance, smelters, include, the, mitsubishi, smelting, reactor, flash, smelters, account, for, over, 50, of, the, world, s, copper, smelters, there, are, many, more, varieties, of, smelting, processes, including, the, kivset, ausmelt, tamano, eaf, and, bf, of, the, seven, metals, known, in, antiquity, only, gold, regularly, occurs, in, nature, as, a, native, metal, the, others, copper, lead, silver, tin, iron, and, mercury, occur, primarily, as, minerals, although, native, copper, is, occasionally, found, in, commercially, significant, quantities, these, minerals, are, primarily, carbonates, sulfides, or, oxides, of, the, metal, mixed, with, other, components, such, as, silica, and, alumina, roasting, the, carbonate, and, sulfide, minerals, in, the, air, converts, them, to, oxides, the, oxides, in, turn, are, smelted, into, the, metal, carbon, monoxide, was, and, is, the, reducing, agent, of, choice, for, smelting, it, is, easily, produced, during, the, heating, process, and, as, a, gas, comes, into, intimate, contact, with, the, ore, in, the, old, world, humans, learned, to, smelt, metals, in, prehistoric, times, more, than, 8000, years, ago, the, discovery, and, use, of, the, useful, metals, copper, and, bronze, at, first, then, iron, a, few, millennia, later, had, an, enormous, impact, on, human, society, the, impact, was, so, pervasive, that, scholars, traditionally, divide, ancient, history, into, stone, age, bronze, age, and, iron, age, in, the, americas, pre, inca, civilizations, of, the, central, andes, in, peru, had, mastered, the, smelting, of, copper, and, silver, at, least, six, centuries, before, the, first, europeans, arrived, in, the, 16th, century, while, never, mastering, the, smelting, of, metals, such, as, iron, for, use, with, weapon, craft, copper, was, the, first, metal, to, be, smelted, how, the, discovery, came, about, is, debated, campfires, are, about, 200, c, short, of, the, temperature, needed, so, some, propose, that, the, first, smelting, of, copper, may, have, occurred, in, pottery, kilns, the, development, of, copper, smelting, in, the, andes, which, is, believed, to, have, occurred, independently, of, the, old, world, may, have, occurred, in, the, same, way, the, earliest, current, evidence, of, copper, smelting, dating, from, between, 5500, bc, and, 5000, bc, has, been, found, in, plo, nik, and, belovode, serbia, a, mace, head, found, in, turkey, and, dated, to, 5000, bc, once, thought, to, be, the, oldest, evidence, now, appears, to, be, hammered, native, copper, combining, copper, with, tin, and, or, arsenic, in, the, right, proportions, produces, bronze, an, alloy, that, is, significantly, harder, than, copper, the, first, copper, arsenic, bronzes, date, from, 4200, bc, from, asia, minor, the, inca, bronze, alloys, were, also, of, this, type, arsenic, is, often, an, impurity, in, copper, ores, so, the, discovery, could, have, been, made, by, accident, eventually, arsenic, bearing, minerals, were, intentionally, added, during, smelting, copper, tin, bronzes, harder, and, more, durable, were, developed, around, 3500, bc, also, in, asia, minor, how, smiths, learned, to, produce, copper, tin, bronzes, is, unknown, the, first, such, bronzes, may, have, been, a, lucky, accident, from, tin, contaminated, copper, ores, however, by, 2000, bc, people, were, mining, tin, on, purpose, to, produce, bronze, which, is, remarkable, as, tin, is, a, semi, rare, metal, and, even, a, rich, cassiterite, ore, only, has, 5, tin, the, discovery, of, copper, and, bronze, manufacture, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, history, of, the, old, world, metals, were, hard, enough, to, make, weapons, that, were, heavier, stronger, and, more, resistant, to, impact, damage, than, wood, bone, or, stone, equivalents, for, several, millennia, bronze, was, the, material, of, choice, for, weapons, such, as, swords, daggers, battle, axes, and, spear, and, arrow, points, as, well, as, protective, gear, such, as, shields, helmets, greaves, metal, shin, guards, and, other, body, armor, bronze, also, supplanted, stone, wood, and, organic, materials, in, tools, and, household, utensils, such, as, chisels, saws, adzes, nails, blade, shears, knives, sewing, needles, and, pins, jugs, cooking, pots, and, cauldrons, mirrors, and, horse, harnesses, tin, and, copper, also, contributed, to, the, establishment, of, trade, networks, that, spanned, large, areas, of, europe, and, asia, and, had, a, major, effect, on, the, distribution, of, wealth, among, individuals, and, nations, the, earliest, known, cast, lead, beads, were, thought, to, be, in, the, atalh, y, k, site, in, anatolia, turkey, and, dated, from, about, 6500, bc, however, recent, research, has, discovered, that, this, was, not, lead, but, rather, cerussite, and, galena, minerals, rich, in, but, distinct, from, lead, since, the, discovery, happened, several, millennia, before, the, invention, of, writing, there, is, no, written, record, of, how, it, was, made, however, tin, and, lead, can, be, smelted, by, placing, the, ores, in, a, wood, fire, leaving, the, possibility, that, the, discovery, may, have, occurred, by, accident, recent, scholarship, however, has, called, this, find, into, question, lead, is, a, common, metal, but, its, discovery, had, relatively, little, impact, in, the, ancient, world, it, is, too, soft, to, use, for, structural, elements, or, weapons, though, its, high, density, relative, to, other, metals, makes, it, ideal, for, sling, projectiles, however, since, it, was, easy, to, cast, and, shape, workers, in, the, classical, world, of, ancient, greece, and, ancient, rome, used, it, extensively, to, pipe, and, store, water, they, also, used, it, as, a, mortar, in, stone, buildings, tin, was, much, less, common, than, lead, is, only, marginally, harder, and, had, even, less, impact, by, itself, the, earliest, evidence, for, iron, making, is, a, small, number, of, iron, fragments, with, the, appropriate, amounts, of, carbon, admixture, found, in, the, proto, hittite, layers, at, kaman, kaleh, y, k, and, dated, to, 2200, 2000, bce, souckova, siegolov, 2001, shows, that, iron, implements, were, made, in, central, anatolia, in, very, limited, quantities, around, 1800, bce, and, were, in, general, use, by, elites, though, not, by, commoners, during, the, new, hittite, empire, 1400, 1200, bce, archaeologists, have, found, indications, of, iron, working, in, ancient, egypt, somewhere, between, the, third, intermediate, period, and, 23rd, dynasty, ca, 1100, 750, bce, significantly, though, they, have, found, no, evidence, of, iron, ore, smelting, in, any, pre, modern, period, in, addition, very, early, instances, of, carbon, steel, were, in, production, around, 2000, years, ago, around, the, first, century, ce, in, northwest, tanzania, based, on, complex, preheating, principles, these, discoveries, are, significant, for, the, history, of, metallurgy, most, early, processes, in, europe, and, africa, involved, smelting, iron, ore, in, a, bloomery, where, the, temperature, is, kept, low, enough, so, that, the, iron, does, not, melt, this, produces, a, spongy, mass, of, iron, called, a, bloom, which, then, must, be, consolidated, with, a, hammer, to, produce, wrought, iron, the, earliest, evidence, to, date, for, the, bloomery, smelting, of, iron, is, found, at, tell, hammeh, jordan, and, dates, to, 930, bce, c14, dating, from, the, medieval, period, an, indirect, process, began, to, replace, the, direct, reduction, in, bloomeries, this, used, a, blast, furnace, to, make, pig, iron, which, then, had, to, undergo, a, further, process, to, make, forgeable, bar, iron, processes, for, the, second, stage, include, fining, in, a, finery, forge, in, the, 13th, century, during, the, high, middle, ages, the, blast, furnace, was, introduced, by, china, who, had, been, using, it, since, as, early, as, 200, b, c, during, the, qin, dynasty, puddling, was, also, introduced, in, the, industrial, revolution, both, processes, are, now, obsolete, and, wrought, iron, is, now, rarely, made, instead, mild, steel, is, produced, from, a, bessemer, converter, or, by, other, means, including, smelting, reduction, processes, such, as, the, corex, process, smelting, has, serious, effects, on, the, environment, producing, wastewater, and, slag, and, releasing, such, toxic, metals, as, copper, silver, iron, cobalt, and, selenium, into, the, atmosphere, smelters, also, release, gaseous, sulfur, dioxide, contributing, to, acid, rain, which, acidifies, soil, and, water, the, smelter, in, flin, flon, canada, was, one, of, the, largest, point, sources, of, mercury, in, north, america, in, the, 20th, century, even, after, smelter, releases, were, drastically, reduced, landscape, re, emission, continued, to, be, a, major, regional, source, of, mercury, lakes, will, likely, receive, mercury, contamination, from, the, smelter, for, decades, from, both, re, emissions, returning, as, rainwater, and, leaching, of, metals, from, the, soil, air, pollutants, generated, by, aluminium, smelters, include, carbonyl, sulfide, hydrogen, fluoride, polycyclic, compounds, lead, nickel, manganese, polychlorinated, biphenyls, and, mercury, copper, smelter, emissions, include, arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, manganese, and, nickel, lead, smelters, typically, emit, arsenic, antimony, cadmium, and, various, lead, compounds, wastewater, pollutants, discharged, by, iron, and, steel, mills, includes, gasification, products, such, as, benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, cyanide, ammonia, phenols, and, cresols, together, with, a, range, of, more, complex, organic, compounds, known, collectively, as, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pah, treatment, technologies, include, recycling, of, wastewater, settling, basins, clarifiers, and, filtration, systems, for, solids, removal, oil, skimmers, and, filtration, chemical, precipitation, and, filtration, for, dissolved, metals, carbon, adsorption, and, biological, oxidation, for, organic, pollutants, and, evaporation, pollutants, generated, by, other, types, of, smelters, varies, with, the, base, metal, ore, for, example, aluminum, smelters, typically, generate, fluoride, benzo, a, pyrene, antimony, and, nickel, as, well, as, aluminum, copper, smelters, typically, discharge, cadmium, lead, zinc, arsenic, and, nickel, in, addition, to, copper, lead, smelters, may, discharge, antimony, asbestos, cadmium, copper, and, zinc, in, addition, to, lead, labourers, working, in, the, smelting, industry, have, reported, respiratory, illnesses, inhibiting, their, ability, to, perform, the, physical, tasks, demanded, by, their, jobs, in, the, united, states, the, environmental,
