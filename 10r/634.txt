cotton, is, a, soft, fluffy, staple, fiber, that, grows, in, a, boll, or, protective, case, around, the, seeds, of, the, cotton, plants, of, the, genus, gossypium, in, the, mallow, family, malvaceae, the, fiber, is, almost, pure, cellulose, and, can, contain, minor, percentages, of, waxes, fats, pectins, and, water, under, natural, conditions, the, cotton, bolls, will, increase, the, dispersal, of, the, seeds, the, plant, is, a, shrub, native, to, tropical, and, subtropical, regions, around, the, world, including, the, americas, africa, egypt, and, india, the, greatest, diversity, of, wild, cotton, species, is, found, in, mexico, followed, by, australia, and, africa, cotton, was, independently, domesticated, in, the, old, and, new, worlds, the, fiber, is, most, often, spun, into, yarn, or, thread, and, used, to, make, a, soft, breathable, and, durable, textile, the, use, of, cotton, for, fabric, is, known, to, date, to, prehistoric, times, fragments, of, cotton, fabric, dated, to, the, fifth, millennium, bc, have, been, found, in, the, indus, valley, civilization, as, well, as, fabric, remnants, dated, back, to, 4200, bc, in, peru, although, cultivated, since, antiquity, it, was, the, invention, of, the, cotton, gin, that, lowered, the, cost, of, production, that, led, to, its, widespread, use, and, it, is, the, most, widely, used, natural, fiber, cloth, in, clothing, today, current, estimates, for, world, production, are, about, 25, million, tonnes, or, 110, million, bales, annually, accounting, for, 2, 5, of, the, world, s, arable, land, india, is, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, cotton, the, united, states, has, been, the, largest, exporter, for, many, years, there, are, four, commercially, grown, species, of, cotton, all, domesticated, in, antiquity, hybrid, varieties, are, also, cultivated, the, two, new, world, cotton, species, account, for, the, vast, majority, of, modern, cotton, production, but, the, two, old, world, species, were, widely, used, before, the, 1900s, while, cotton, fibers, occur, naturally, in, colors, of, white, brown, pink, and, green, fears, of, contaminating, the, genetics, of, white, cotton, have, led, many, cotton, growing, locations, to, ban, the, growing, of, colored, cotton, varieties, the, word, cotton, has, arabic, origins, derived, from, the, arabic, word, qutn, or, qutun, this, was, the, usual, word, for, cotton, in, medieval, arabic, marco, polo, in, chapter, 2, in, his, book, describes, a, province, he, calls, khotan, in, turkestan, today, s, xinjiang, where, cotton, was, grown, in, abundance, the, word, entered, the, romance, languages, in, the, mid, 12th, century, and, english, a, century, later, cotton, fabric, was, known, to, the, ancient, romans, as, an, import, but, cotton, was, rare, in, the, romance, speaking, lands, until, imports, from, the, arabic, speaking, lands, in, the, later, medieval, era, at, transformatively, lowered, prices, the, earliest, evidence, of, the, use, of, cotton, in, the, old, world, dated, to, 5500, bc, and, preserved, in, copper, beads, has, been, found, at, the, neolithic, site, of, mehrgarh, at, the, foot, of, the, bolan, pass, in, ancient, india, today, in, balochistan, pakistan, fragments, of, cotton, textiles, have, been, found, at, mohenjo, daro, and, other, sites, of, the, bronze, age, indus, valley, civilization, and, cotton, may, have, been, an, important, export, from, it, cotton, bolls, discovered, in, a, cave, near, tehuac, n, mexico, have, been, dated, to, as, early, as, 5500, bc, but, this, date, has, been, challenged, more, securely, dated, is, the, domestication, of, gossypium, hirsutum, in, mexico, between, around, 3400, and, 2300, bc, during, this, time, people, between, the, r, o, santiago, and, the, r, o, balsas, grew, spun, wove, dyed, and, sewed, cotton, what, they, did, not, use, themselves, they, sent, to, their, aztec, rulers, as, tribute, on, the, scale, of, 116, million, pounds, annually, in, peru, cultivation, of, the, indigenous, cotton, species, gossypium, barbadense, has, been, dated, from, a, find, in, ancon, to, c, 4200, bc, and, was, the, backbone, of, the, development, of, coastal, cultures, such, as, the, norte, chico, moche, and, nazca, cotton, was, grown, upriver, made, into, nets, and, traded, with, fishing, villages, along, the, coast, for, large, supplies, of, fish, the, spanish, who, came, to, mexico, and, peru, in, the, early, 16th, century, found, the, people, growing, cotton, and, wearing, clothing, made, of, it, the, greeks, and, the, arabs, were, not, familiar, with, cotton, until, the, wars, of, alexander, the, great, as, his, contemporary, megasthenes, told, seleucus, i, nicator, of, there, being, trees, on, which, wool, grows, in, indica, this, may, be, a, reference, to, tree, cotton, gossypium, arboreum, which, is, native, to, the, indian, subcontinent, according, to, the, columbia, encyclopedia, cotton, has, been, spun, woven, and, dyed, since, prehistoric, times, it, clothed, the, people, of, ancient, india, egypt, and, china, hundreds, of, years, before, the, christian, era, cotton, textiles, were, woven, in, india, with, matchless, skill, and, their, use, spread, to, the, mediterranean, countries, in, iran, persia, the, history, of, cotton, dates, back, to, the, achaemenid, era, 5th, century, bc, however, there, are, few, sources, about, the, planting, of, cotton, in, pre, islamic, iran, cotton, cultivation, was, common, in, merv, ray, and, pars, in, persian, poems, especially, ferdowsi, s, shahname, there, are, references, to, cotton, panbe, in, persian, marco, polo, 13th, century, refers, to, the, major, products, of, persia, including, cotton, john, chardin, a, french, traveler, of, the, 17th, century, who, visited, safavid, persia, spoke, approvingly, of, the, vast, cotton, farms, of, persia, cotton, gossypium, herbaceum, linnaeus, may, have, been, domesticated, 5000, bc, in, eastern, sudan, near, the, middle, nile, basin, region, where, cotton, cloth, was, being, produced, around, the, 4th, century, bc, the, cultivation, of, cotton, and, the, knowledge, of, its, spinning, and, weaving, in, mero, reached, a, high, level, the, export, of, textiles, was, one, of, the, sources, of, wealth, for, mero, ancient, nubia, had, a, culture, of, cotton, of, sorts, evidenced, by, physical, evidence, of, cotton, processing, tools, and, the, presence, of, cattle, in, certain, areas, some, researchers, propose, that, cotton, was, important, to, the, nubian, economy, for, its, use, in, contact, with, the, neighboring, egyptians, aksumite, king, ezana, boasted, in, his, inscription, that, he, destroyed, large, cotton, plantations, in, mero, during, his, conquest, of, the, region, in, the, meroitic, period, beginning, 3rd, century, bce, many, cotton, textiles, have, been, recovered, preserved, due, to, favorable, arid, conditions, most, of, these, fabric, fragments, come, from, lower, nubia, and, the, cotton, textiles, account, for, 85, of, the, archaeological, textiles, from, classic, late, meroitic, sites, due, to, these, arid, conditions, cotton, a, plant, that, usually, thrives, moderate, rainfall, and, richer, soils, requires, extra, irrigation, and, labor, in, sudanese, climate, conditions, therefore, a, great, deal, of, resources, would, have, been, required, likely, restricting, its, cultivation, to, the, elite, in, the, first, to, third, centuries, ce, recovered, cotton, fragments, all, began, to, mirror, the, same, style, and, production, method, as, seen, from, the, direction, of, spun, cotton, and, technique, of, weaving, cotton, textiles, also, appear, in, places, of, high, regard, such, as, on, funerary, stelae, and, statues, during, the, han, dynasty, 207, bc, 220, ad, cotton, was, grown, by, chinese, peoples, in, the, southern, chinese, province, of, yunnan, egyptians, grew, and, spun, cotton, in, the, first, seven, centuries, of, the, christian, era, handheld, roller, cotton, gins, had, been, used, in, india, since, the, 6th, century, and, was, then, introduced, to, other, countries, from, there, between, the, 12th, and, 14th, centuries, dual, roller, gins, appeared, in, india, and, china, the, indian, version, of, the, dual, roller, gin, was, prevalent, throughout, the, mediterranean, cotton, trade, by, the, 16th, century, this, mechanical, device, was, in, some, areas, driven, by, water, power, the, earliest, clear, illustrations, of, the, spinning, wheel, come, from, the, islamic, world, in, the, eleventh, century, the, earliest, unambiguous, reference, to, a, spinning, wheel, in, india, is, dated, to, 1350, suggesting, that, the, spinning, wheel, was, likely, introduced, from, iran, to, india, during, the, delhi, sultanate, during, the, late, medieval, period, cotton, became, known, as, an, imported, fiber, in, northern, europe, without, any, knowledge, of, how, it, was, derived, other, than, that, it, was, a, plant, because, herodotus, had, written, in, his, histories, book, iii, 106, that, in, india, trees, grew, in, the, wild, producing, wool, it, was, assumed, that, the, plant, was, a, tree, rather, than, a, shrub, this, aspect, is, retained, in, the, name, for, cotton, in, several, germanic, languages, such, as, german, baumwolle, which, translates, as, tree, wool, baum, means, tree, wolle, means, wool, noting, its, similarities, to, wool, people, in, the, region, could, only, imagine, that, cotton, must, be, produced, by, plant, borne, sheep, john, mandeville, writing, in, 1350, stated, as, fact, that, there, grew, there, a, wonderful, tree, which, bore, tiny, lambs, on, the, endes, of, its, branches, these, branches, were, so, pliable, that, they, bent, down, to, allow, the, lambs, to, feed, when, they, are, hungry, see, vegetable, lamb, of, tartary, cotton, manufacture, was, introduced, to, europe, during, the, muslim, conquest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, and, sicily, the, knowledge, of, cotton, weaving, was, spread, to, northern, italy, in, the, 12th, century, when, sicily, was, conquered, by, the, normans, and, consequently, to, the, rest, of, europe, the, spinning, wheel, introduced, to, europe, circa, 1350, improved, the, speed, of, cotton, spinning, by, the, 15th, century, venice, antwerp, and, haarlem, were, important, ports, for, cotton, trade, and, the, sale, and, transportation, of, cotton, fabrics, had, become, very, profitable, under, the, mughal, empire, which, ruled, in, the, indian, subcontinent, from, the, early, 16th, century, to, the, early, 18th, century, indian, cotton, production, increased, in, terms, of, both, raw, cotton, and, cotton, textiles, the, mughals, introduced, agrarian, reforms, such, as, a, new, revenue, system, that, was, biased, in, favour, of, higher, value, cash, crops, such, as, cotton, and, indigo, providing, state, incentives, to, grow, cash, crops, in, addition, to, rising, market, demand, the, largest, manufacturing, industry, in, the, mughal, empire, was, cotton, textile, manufacturing, which, included, the, production, of, piece, goods, calicos, and, muslins, available, unbleached, and, in, a, variety, of, colours, the, cotton, textile, industry, was, responsible, for, a, large, part, of, the, empire, s, international, trade, india, had, a, 25, share, of, the, global, textile, trade, in, the, early, 18th, century, indian, cotton, textiles, were, the, most, important, manufactured, goods, in, world, trade, in, the, 18th, century, consumed, across, the, world, from, the, americas, to, japan, the, most, important, center, of, cotton, production, was, the, bengal, subah, province, particularly, around, its, capital, city, of, dhaka, the, worm, gear, roller, cotton, gin, which, was, invented, in, india, during, the, early, delhi, sultanate, era, of, the, 13th, 14th, centuries, came, into, use, in, the, mughal, empire, some, time, around, the, 16th, century, and, is, still, used, in, india, through, to, the, present, day, another, innovation, the, incorporation, of, the, crank, handle, in, the, cotton, gin, first, appeared, in, india, some, time, during, the, late, delhi, sultanate, or, the, early, mughal, empire, the, production, of, cotton, which, may, have, largely, been, spun, in, the, villages, and, then, taken, to, towns, in, the, form, of, yarn, to, be, woven, into, cloth, textiles, was, advanced, by, the, diffusion, of, the, spinning, wheel, across, india, shortly, before, the, mughal, era, lowering, the, costs, of, yarn, and, helping, to, increase, demand, for, cotton, the, diffusion, of, the, spinning, wheel, and, the, incorporation, of, the, worm, gear, and, crank, handle, into, the, roller, cotton, gin, led, to, greatly, expanded, indian, cotton, textile, production, during, the, mughal, era, it, was, reported, that, with, an, indian, cotton, gin, which, is, half, machine, and, half, tool, one, man, and, one, woman, could, clean, 28, pounds, of, cotton, per, day, with, a, modified, forbes, version, one, man, and, a, boy, could, produce, 250, pounds, per, day, if, oxen, were, used, to, power, 16, of, these, machines, and, a, few, people, s, labour, was, used, to, feed, them, they, could, produce, as, much, work, as, 750, people, did, formerly, in, the, early, 19th, century, a, frenchman, named, m, jumel, proposed, to, the, great, ruler, of, egypt, mohamed, ali, pasha, that, he, could, earn, a, substantial, income, by, growing, an, extra, long, staple, maho, gossypium, barbadense, cotton, in, lower, egypt, for, the, french, market, mohamed, ali, pasha, accepted, the, proposition, and, granted, himself, the, monopoly, on, the, sale, and, export, of, cotton, in, egypt, and, later, dictated, cotton, should, be, grown, in, preference, to, other, crops, egypt, under, muhammad, ali, in, the, early, 19th, century, had, the, fifth, most, productive, cotton, industry, in, the, world, in, terms, of, the, number, of, spindles, per, capita, the, industry, was, initially, driven, by, machinery, that, relied, on, traditional, energy, sources, such, as, animal, power, water, wheels, and, windmills, which, were, also, the, principal, energy, sources, in, western, europe, up, until, around, 1870, it, was, under, muhammad, ali, in, the, early, 19th, century, that, steam, engines, were, introduced, to, the, egyptian, cotton, industry, by, the, time, of, the, american, civil, war, annual, exports, had, reached, 16, million, 120, 000, bales, which, rose, to, 56, million, by, 1864, primarily, due, to, the, loss, of, the, confederate, supply, on, the, world, market, exports, continued, to, grow, even, after, the, reintroduction, of, us, cotton, produced, now, by, a, paid, workforce, and, egyptian, exports, reached, 1, 2, million, bales, a, year, by, 1903, the, english, east, india, company, eic, introduced, the, british, to, cheap, calico, and, chintz, cloth, on, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, in, the, 1660s, initially, imported, as, a, novelty, side, line, from, its, spice, trading, posts, in, asia, the, cheap, colourful, cloth, proved, popular, and, overtook, the, eic, s, spice, trade, by, value, in, the, late, 17th, century, the, eic, embraced, the, demand, particularly, for, calico, by, expanding, its, factories, in, asia, and, producing, and, importing, cloth, in, bulk, creating, competition, for, domestic, woollen, and, linen, textile, producers, the, impacted, weavers, spinners, dyers, shepherds, and, farmers, objected, and, the, calico, question, became, one, of, the, major, issues, of, national, politics, between, the, 1680s, and, the, 1730s, parliament, began, to, see, a, decline, in, domestic, textile, sales, and, an, increase, in, imported, textiles, from, places, like, china, and, india, seeing, the, east, india, company, and, their, textile, importation, as, a, threat, to, domestic, textile, businesses, parliament, passed, the, 1700, calico, act, blocking, the, importation, of, cotton, cloth, as, there, was, no, punishment, for, continuing, to, sell, cotton, cloth, smuggling, of, the, popular, material, became, commonplace, in, 1721, dissatisfied, with, the, results, of, the, first, act, parliament, passed, a, stricter, addition, this, time, prohibiting, the, sale, of, most, cottons, imported, and, domestic, exempting, only, thread, fustian, and, raw, cotton, the, exemption, of, raw, cotton, from, the, prohibition, initially, saw, 2, thousand, bales, of, cotton, imported, annually, to, become, the, basis, of, a, new, indigenous, industry, initially, producing, fustian, for, the, domestic, market, though, more, importantly, triggering, the, development, of, a, series, of, mechanised, spinning, and, weaving, technologies, to, process, the, material, this, mechanised, production, was, concentrated, in, new, cotton, mills, which, slowly, expanded, until, by, the, beginning, of, the, 1770s, seven, thousand, bales, of, cotton, were, imported, annually, and, pressure, was, put, on, parliament, by, the, new, mill, owners, to, remove, the, prohibition, on, the, production, and, sale, of, pure, cotton, cloth, as, they, could, easily, compete, with, anything, the, eic, could, import, the, acts, were, repealed, in, 1774, triggering, a, wave, of, investment, in, mill, based, cotton, spinning, and, production, doubling, the, demand, for, raw, cotton, within, a, couple, of, years, and, doubling, it, again, every, decade, into, the, 1840s, indian, cotton, textiles, particularly, those, from, bengal, continued, to, maintain, a, competitive, advantage, up, until, the, 19th, century, in, order, to, compete, with, india, britain, invested, in, labour, saving, technical, progress, while, implementing, protectionist, policies, such, as, bans, and, tariffs, to, restrict, indian, imports, at, the, same, time, the, east, india, company, s, rule, in, india, contributed, to, its, deindustrialization, opening, up, a, new, market, for, british, goods, while, the, capital, amassed, from, bengal, after, its, 1757, conquest, was, used, to, invest, in, british, industries, such, as, textile, manufacturing, and, greatly, increase, british, wealth, british, colonization, also, forced, open, the, large, indian, market, to, british, goods, which, could, be, sold, in, india, without, tariffs, or, duties, compared, to, local, indian, producers, who, were, heavily, taxed, while, raw, cotton, was, imported, from, india, without, tariffs, to, british, factories, which, manufactured, textiles, from, indian, cotton, giving, britain, a, monopoly, over, india, s, large, market, and, cotton, resources, india, served, as, both, a, significant, supplier, of, raw, goods, to, british, manufacturers, and, a, large, captive, market, for, british, manufactured, goods, britain, eventually, surpassed, india, as, the, world, s, leading, cotton, textile, manufacturer, in, the, 19th, century, india, s, cotton, processing, sector, changed, during, eic, expansion, in, india, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, from, focusing, on, supplying, the, british, market, to, supplying, east, asia, with, raw, cotton, as, the, artisan, produced, textiles, were, no, longer, competitive, with, those, produced, industrially, and, europe, preferring, the, cheaper, slave, produced, long, staple, american, and, egyptian, cottons, for, its, own, materials, the, advent, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, britain, provided, a, great, boost, to, cotton, manufacture, as, textiles, emerged, as, britain, s, leading, export, in, 1738, lewis, paul, and, john, wyatt, of, birmingham, england, patented, the, roller, spinning, machine, as, well, as, the, flyer, and, bobbin, system, for, drawing, cotton, to, a, more, even, thickness, using, two, sets, of, rollers, that, traveled, at, different, speeds, later, the, invention, of, the, james, hargreaves, spinning, jenny, in, 1764, richard, arkwright, s, spinning, frame, in, 1769, and, samuel, crompton, s, spinning, mule, in, 1775, enabled, british, spinners, to, produce, cotton, yarn, at, much, higher, rates, from, the, late, 18th, century, on, the, british, city, of, manchester, acquired, the, nickname, cottonopolis, due, to, the, cotton, industry, s, omnipresence, within, the, city, and, manchester, s, role, as, the, heart, of, the, global, cotton, trade, production, capacity, in, britain, and, the, united, states, was, improved, by, the, invention, of, the, modern, cotton, gin, by, the, american, eli, whitney, in, 1793, before, the, development, of, cotton, gins, the, cotton, fibers, had, to, be, pulled, from, the, seeds, tediously, by, hand, by, the, late, 1700s, a, number, of, crude, ginning, machines, had, been, developed, however, to, produce, a, bale, of, cotton, required, over, 600, hours, of, human, labor, making, large, scale, production, uneconomical, in, the, united, states, even, with, the, use, of, humans, as, slave, labor, the, gin, that, whitney, manufactured, the, holmes, design, reduced, the, hours, down, to, just, a, dozen, or, so, per, bale, although, whitney, patented, his, own, design, for, a, cotton, gin, he, manufactured, a, prior, design, from, henry, odgen, holmes, for, which, holmes, filed, a, patent, in, 1796, improving, technology, and, increasing, control, of, world, markets, allowed, british, traders, to, develop, a, commercial, chain, in, which, raw, cotton, fibers, were, at, first, purchased, from, colonial, plantations, processed, into, cotton, cloth, in, the, mills, of, lancashire, and, then, exported, on, british, ships, to, captive, colonial, markets, in, west, africa, india, and, china, via, shanghai, and, hong, kong, by, the, 1840s, india, was, no, longer, capable, of, supplying, the, vast, quantities, of, cotton, fibers, needed, by, mechanized, british, factories, while, shipping, bulky, low, price, cotton, from, india, to, britain, was, time, consuming, and, expensive, this, coupled, with, the, emergence, of, american, cotton, as, a, superior, type, due, to, the, longer, stronger, fibers, of, the, two, domesticated, native, american, species, gossypium, hirsutum, and, gossypium, barbadense, encouraged, british, traders, to, purchase, cotton, from, plantations, in, the, united, states, and, in, the, caribbean, by, the, mid, 19th, century, king, cotton, had, become, the, backbone, of, the, southern, american, economy, in, the, united, states, cultivating, and, harvesting, cotton, became, the, leading, occupation, of, slaves, during, the, american, civil, war, american, cotton, exports, slumped, due, to, a, union, blockade, on, southern, ports, and, because, of, a, strategic, decision, by, the, confederate, government, to, cut, exports, hoping, to, force, britain, to, recognize, the, confederacy, or, enter, the, war, the, lancashire, cotton, famine, prompted, the, main, purchasers, of, cotton, britain, and, france, to, turn, to, egyptian, cotton, british, and, french, traders, invested, heavily, in, cotton, plantations, the, egyptian, government, of, viceroy, isma, il, took, out, substantial, loans, from, european, bankers, and, stock, exchanges, after, the, american, civil, war, ended, in, 1865, british, and, french, traders, abandoned, egyptian, cotton, and, returned, to, cheap, american, exports, sending, egypt, into, a, deficit, spiral, that, led, to, the, country, declaring, bankruptcy, in, 1876, a, key, factor, behind, egypt, s, occupation, by, the, british, empire, in, 1882, during, this, time, cotton, cultivation, in, the, british, empire, especially, australia, and, india, greatly, increased, to, replace, the, lost, production, of, the, american, south, through, tariffs, and, other, restrictions, the, british, government, discouraged, the, production, of, cotton, cloth, in, india, rather, the, raw, fiber, was, sent, to, england, for, processing, the, indian, mahatma, gandhi, described, the, process, in, the, united, states, growing, southern, cotton, generated, significant, wealth, and, capital, for, the, antebellum, south, as, well, as, raw, material, for, northern, textile, industries, before, 1865, the, cotton, was, largely, produced, through, the, labor, of, enslaved, african, americans, it, enriched, both, the, southern, landowners, and, the, new, textile, industries, of, the, northeastern, united, states, and, northwestern, europe, in, 1860, the, slogan, cotton, is, king, characterized, the, attitude, of, southern, leaders, toward, this, monocrop, in, that, europe, would, support, an, independent, confederate, states, of, america, in, 1861, in, order, to, protect, the, supply, of, cotton, it, needed, for, its, very, large, textile, industry, russell, griffin, of, california, was, a, farmer, who, farmed, one, of, the, biggest, cotton, operations, he, produced, over, sixty, thousand, bales, cotton, remained, a, key, crop, in, the, southern, economy, after, slavery, ended, in, 1865, across, the, south, sharecropping, evolved, in, which, landless, farmers, worked, land, owned, by, others, in, return, for, a, share, of, the, profits, some, farmers, rented, the, land, and, bore, the, production, costs, themselves, until, mechanical, cotton, pickers, were, developed, cotton, farmers, needed, additional, labor, to, hand, pick, cotton, picking, cotton, was, a, source, of, income, for, families, across, the, south, rural, and, small, town, school, systems, had, split, vacations, so,

s, rural, labor, force, dwindled, during, the, world, wars, cotton, remains, a, major, export, of, the, united, states, with, large, farms, in, california, arizona, and, the, deep, south, to, acknowledge, cotton, s, place, in, the, history, and, heritage, of, texas, the, texas, legislature, designated, cotton, the, official, state, fiber, and, fabric, of, texas, in, 1997, china, s, chang, e, 4, spacecraft, took, cotton, seeds, to, the, moon, s, far, side, on, 15, january, 2019, china, announced, that, a, cotton, seed, sprouted, the, first, truly, otherworldly, plant, in, history, inside, the, von, k, rm, n, crater, the, capsule, and, seeds, sit, inside, the, chang, e, 4, lander, successful, cultivation, of, cotton, requires, a, long, frost, free, period, plenty, of, sunshine, and, a, moderate, rainfall, usually, from, 50, to, 100, cm, 19, 5, to, 39, 5, in, soils, usually, need, to, be, fairly, heavy, although, the, level, of, nutrients, does, not, need, to, be, exceptional, in, general, these, conditions, are, met, within, the, seasonally, dry, tropics, and, subtropics, in, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, but, a, large, proportion, of, the, cotton, grown, today, is, cultivated, in, areas, with, less, rainfall, that, obtain, the, water, from, irrigation, production, of, the, crop, for, a, given, year, usually, starts, soon, after, harvesting, the, preceding, autumn, cotton, is, naturally, a, perennial, but, is, grown, as, an, annual, to, help, control, pests, planting, time, in, spring, in, the, northern, hemisphere, varies, from, the, beginning, of, february, to, the, beginning, of, june, the, area, of, the, united, states, known, as, the, south, plains, is, the, largest, contiguous, cotton, growing, region, in, the, world, while, dryland, non, irrigated, cotton, is, successfully, grown, in, this, region, consistent, yields, are, only, produced, with, heavy, reliance, on, irrigation, water, drawn, from, the, ogallala, aquifer, since, cotton, is, somewhat, salt, and, drought, tolerant, this, makes, it, an, attractive, crop, for, arid, and, semiarid, regions, as, water, resources, get, tighter, around, the, world, economies, that, rely, on, it, face, difficulties, and, conflict, as, well, as, potential, environmental, problems, for, example, improper, cropping, and, irrigation, practices, have, led, to, desertification, in, areas, of, uzbekistan, where, cotton, is, a, major, export, in, the, days, of, the, soviet, union, the, aral, sea, was, tapped, for, agricultural, irrigation, largely, of, cotton, and, now, salination, is, widespread, cotton, can, also, be, cultivated, to, have, colors, other, than, the, yellowish, off, white, typical, of, modern, commercial, cotton, fibers, naturally, colored, cotton, can, come, in, red, green, and, several, shades, of, brown, the, water, footprint, of, cotton, fibers, is, substantially, larger, than, for, most, other, plant, fibers, cotton, is, also, known, as, a, thirsty, crop, on, average, globally, cotton, requires, 8, 000, 10, 000, liters, of, water, for, one, kilogram, of, cotton, and, in, dry, areas, it, may, require, even, more, such, as, in, some, areas, of, india, it, may, need, 22, 500, liters, genetically, modified, gm, cotton, was, developed, to, reduce, the, heavy, reliance, on, pesticides, the, bacterium, bacillus, thuringiensis, bt, naturally, produces, a, chemical, harmful, only, to, a, small, fraction, of, insects, most, notably, the, larvae, of, moths, and, butterflies, beetles, and, flies, and, harmless, to, other, forms, of, life, the, gene, coding, for, bt, toxin, has, been, inserted, into, cotton, causing, cotton, called, bt, cotton, to, produce, this, natural, insecticide, in, its, tissues, in, many, regions, the, main, pests, in, commercial, cotton, are, lepidopteran, larvae, which, are, killed, by, the, bt, protein, in, the, transgenic, cotton, they, eat, this, eliminates, the, need, to, use, large, amounts, of, broad, spectrum, insecticides, to, kill, lepidopteran, pests, some, of, which, have, developed, pyrethroid, resistance, this, spares, natural, insect, predators, in, the, farm, ecology, and, further, contributes, to, noninsecticide, pest, management, however, bt, cotton, is, ineffective, against, many, cotton, pests, such, as, plant, bugs, stink, bugs, and, aphids, depending, on, circumstances, it, may, still, be, desirable, to, use, insecticides, against, these, a, 2006, study, done, by, cornell, researchers, the, center, for, chinese, agricultural, policy, and, the, chinese, academy, of, science, on, bt, cotton, farming, in, china, found, that, after, seven, years, these, secondary, pests, that, were, normally, controlled, by, pesticide, had, increased, necessitating, the, use, of, pesticides, at, similar, levels, to, non, bt, cotton, and, causing, less, profit, for, farmers, because, of, the, extra, expense, of, gm, seeds, however, a, 2009, study, by, the, chinese, academy, of, sciences, stanford, university, and, rutgers, university, refuted, this, they, concluded, that, the, gm, cotton, effectively, controlled, bollworm, the, secondary, pests, were, mostly, miridae, plant, bugs, whose, increase, was, related, to, local, temperature, and, rainfall, and, only, continued, to, increase, in, half, the, villages, studied, moreover, the, increase, in, insecticide, use, for, the, control, of, these, secondary, insects, was, far, smaller, than, the, reduction, in, total, insecticide, use, due, to, bt, cotton, adoption, a, 2012, chinese, study, concluded, that, bt, cotton, halved, the, use, of, pesticides, and, doubled, the, level, of, ladybirds, lacewings, and, spiders, the, international, service, for, the, acquisition, of, agri, biotech, applications, isaaa, said, that, worldwide, gm, cotton, was, planted, on, an, area, of, 25, million, hectares, in, 2011, this, was, 69, of, the, worldwide, total, area, planted, in, cotton, gm, cotton, acreage, in, india, grew, at, a, rapid, rate, increasing, from, 50, 000, hectares, in, 2002, to, 10, 6, million, hectares, in, 2011, the, total, cotton, area, in, india, was, 12, 1, million, hectares, in, 2011, so, gm, cotton, was, grown, on, 88, of, the, cotton, area, this, made, india, the, country, with, the, largest, area, of, gm, cotton, in, the, world, a, long, term, study, on, the, economic, impacts, of, bt, cotton, in, india, published, in, the, journal, pnas, in, 2012, showed, that, bt, cotton, has, increased, yields, profits, and, living, standards, of, smallholder, farmers, the, u, s, gm, cotton, crop, was, 4, 0, million, hectares, in, 2011, the, second, largest, area, in, the, world, the, chinese, gm, cotton, crop, was, third, largest, by, area, with, 3, 9, million, hectares, and, pakistan, had, the, fourth, largest, gm, cotton, crop, area, of, 2, 6, million, hectares, in, 2011, the, initial, introduction, of, gm, cotton, proved, to, be, a, success, in, australia, the, yields, were, equivalent, to, the, non, transgenic, varieties, and, the, crop, used, much, less, pesticide, to, produce, 85, reduction, the, subsequent, introduction, of, a, second, variety, of, gm, cotton, led, to, increases, in, gm, cotton, production, until, 95, of, the, australian, cotton, crop, was, gm, in, 2009, making, australia, the, country, with, the, fifth, largest, gm, cotton, crop, in, the, world, other, gm, cotton, growing, countries, in, 2011, were, argentina, myanmar, burkina, faso, brazil, mexico, colombia, south, africa, and, costa, rica, cotton, has, been, genetically, modified, for, resistance, to, glyphosate, a, broad, spectrum, herbicide, discovered, by, monsanto, which, also, sells, some, of, the, bt, cotton, seeds, to, farmers, there, are, also, a, number, of, other, cotton, seed, companies, selling, gm, cotton, around, the, world, about, 62, of, the, gm, cotton, grown, from, 1996, to, 2011, was, insect, resistant, 24, stacked, product, and, 14, herbicide, resistant, cotton, has, gossypol, a, toxin, that, makes, it, inedible, however, scientists, have, silenced, the, gene, that, produces, the, toxin, making, it, a, potential, food, crop, on, 17, october, 2018, the, usda, deregulated, ge, low, gossypol, cotton, organic, cotton, is, generally, understood, as, cotton, from, plants, not, genetically, modified, and, that, is, certified, to, be, grown, without, the, use, of, any, synthetic, agricultural, chemicals, such, as, fertilizers, or, pesticides, its, production, also, promotes, and, enhances, biodiversity, and, biological, cycles, in, the, united, states, organic, cotton, plantations, are, required, to, enforce, the, national, organic, program, nop, this, institution, determines, the, allowed, practices, for, pest, control, growing, fertilizing, and, handling, of, organic, crops, as, of, 2007, 265, 517, bales, of, organic, cotton, were, produced, in, 24, countries, and, worldwide, production, was, growing, at, a, rate, of, more, than, 50, per, year, organic, cotton, products, are, now, available, for, purchase, at, limited, locations, these, are, popular, for, baby, clothes, and, diapers, natural, cotton, products, are, known, to, be, both, sustainable, and, hypoallergenic, the, cotton, industry, relies, heavily, on, chemicals, such, as, fertilizers, insecticides, and, herbicides, although, a, very, small, number, of, farmers, are, moving, toward, an, organic, model, of, production, under, most, definitions, organic, products, do, not, use, transgenic, bt, cotton, which, contains, a, bacterial, gene, that, codes, for, a, plant, produced, protein, that, is, toxic, to, a, number, of, pests, especially, the, bollworms, for, most, producers, bt, cotton, has, allowed, a, substantial, reduction, in, the, use, of, synthetic, insecticides, although, in, the, long, term, resistance, may, become, problematic, significant, global, pests, of, cotton, include, various, species, of, bollworm, such, as, pectinophora, gossypiella, sucking, pests, include, cotton, stainers, the, chili, thrips, scirtothrips, dorsalis, the, cotton, seed, bug, oxycarenus, hyalinipennis, defoliators, include, the, fall, armyworm, spodoptera, frugiperda, cotton, yield, is, threatened, by, the, evolution, of, new, biotypes, of, insects, and, of, new, pathogens, maintaining, good, yield, requires, strategies, to, slow, these, adversaries, evolution, historically, in, north, america, one, of, the, most, economically, destructive, pests, in, cotton, production, has, been, the, boll, weevil, boll, weevils, are, beetles, who, ate, cotton, in, the, 1950s, that, slowed, the, production, of, the, cotton, industry, drastically, this, bone, pile, of, short, budgets, loss, of, market, share, failing, prices, abandoned, farms, and, the, new, immunity, of, boll, weevils, generated, a, feeling, of, helplessness, boll, weevils, first, appeared, in, beeville, texas, wiping, out, field, after, field, of, cotton, in, south, texas, this, swarm, of, boll, weevils, swept, through, east, texas, and, spread, to, the, eastern, seaboard, leaving, ruin, and, devastation, in, its, path, causing, many, cotton, farmers, to, go, out, of, business, due, to, the, us, department, of, agriculture, s, highly, successful, boll, weevil, eradication, program, bwep, this, pest, has, been, eliminated, from, cotton, in, most, of, the, united, states, this, program, along, with, the, introduction, of, genetically, engineered, bt, cotton, has, improved, the, management, of, a, number, of, pests, such, as, cotton, bollworm, and, pink, bollworm, sucking, pests, include, the, cotton, stainer, dysdercus, suturellus, and, the, tarnish, plant, bug, lygus, lineolaris, a, significant, cotton, disease, is, caused, by, xanthomonas, citri, subsp, malvacearum, most, cotton, in, the, united, states, europe, and, australia, is, harvested, mechanically, either, by, a, cotton, picker, a, machine, that, removes, the, cotton, from, the, boll, without, damaging, the, cotton, plant, or, by, a, cotton, stripper, which, strips, the, entire, boll, off, the, plant, cotton, strippers, are, used, in, regions, where, it, is, too, windy, to, grow, picker, varieties, of, cotton, and, usually, after, application, of, a, chemical, defoliant, or, the, natural, defoliation, that, occurs, after, a, freeze, cotton, is, a, perennial, crop, in, the, tropics, and, without, defoliation, or, freezing, the, plant, will, continue, to, grow, cotton, continues, to, be, picked, by, hand, in, developing, countries, and, in, xinjiang, china, allegedly, by, forced, labor, xinjiang, produces, over, 20, of, the, world, s, cotton, the, era, of, manufactured, fibers, began, with, the, development, of, rayon, in, france, in, the, 1890s, rayon, is, derived, from, a, natural, cellulose, and, cannot, be, considered, synthetic, but, requires, extensive, processing, in, a, manufacturing, process, and, led, the, less, expensive, replacement, of, more, naturally, derived, materials, a, succession, of, new, synthetic, fibers, were, introduced, by, the, chemicals, industry, in, the, following, decades, acetate, in, fiber, form, was, developed, in, 1924, nylon, the, first, fiber, synthesized, entirely, from, petrochemicals, was, introduced, as, a, sewing, thread, by, dupont, in, 1936, followed, by, dupont, s, acrylic, in, 1944, some, garments, were, created, from, fabrics, based, on, these, fibers, such, as, women, s, hosiery, from, nylon, but, it, was, not, until, the, introduction, of, polyester, into, the, fiber, marketplace, in, the, early, 1950s, that, the, market, for, cotton, came, under, threat, the, rapid, uptake, of, polyester, garments, in, the, 1960s, caused, economic, hardship, in, cotton, exporting, economies, especially, in, central, american, countries, such, as, nicaragua, where, cotton, production, had, boomed, tenfold, between, 1950, and, 1965, with, the, advent, of, cheap, chemical, pesticides, cotton, production, recovered, in, the, 1970s, but, crashed, to, pre, 1960, levels, in, the, early, 1990s, high, water, and, pesticide, use, in, cotton, cultivation, has, prompted, sustainability, concerns, and, created, a, market, for, natural, fiber, alternatives, other, cellulose, fibers, such, as, hemp, are, seen, as, more, sustainable, options, because, of, higher, yields, per, acre, with, less, water, and, pesticide, use, than, cotton, cellulose, fiber, alternatives, have, similar, characteristics, but, are, not, perfect, substitutes, for, cotton, textiles, with, differences, in, properties, like, tensile, strength, and, thermal, regulation, cotton, is, used, to, make, a, number, of, textile, products, these, include, terrycloth, for, highly, absorbent, bath, towels, and, robes, denim, for, blue, jeans, cambric, popularly, used, in, the, manufacture, of, blue, work, shirts, from, which, we, get, the, term, blue, collar, and, corduroy, seersucker, and, cotton, twill, socks, underwear, and, most, t, shirts, are, made, from, cotton, bed, sheets, often, are, made, from, cotton, it, is, a, preferred, material, for, sheets, as, it, is, hypoallergenic, easy, to, maintain, and, non, irritant, to, the, skin, cotton, also, is, used, to, make, yarn, used, in, crochet, and, knitting, fabric, also, can, be, made, from, recycled, or, recovered, cotton, that, otherwise, would, be, thrown, away, during, the, spinning, weaving, or, cutting, process, while, many, fabrics, are, made, completely, of, cotton, some, materials, blend, cotton, with, other, fibers, including, rayon, and, synthetic, fibers, such, as, polyester, it, can, either, be, used, in, knitted, or, woven, fabrics, as, it, can, be, blended, with, elastine, to, make, a, stretchier, thread, for, knitted, fabrics, and, apparel, such, as, stretch, jeans, cotton, can, be, blended, also, with, linen, producing, fabrics, with, the, benefits, of, both, materials, linen, cotton, blends, are, wrinkle, resistant, and, retain, heat, more, effectively, than, only, linen, and, are, thinner, stronger, and, lighter, than, only, cotton, in, addition, to, the, textile, industry, cotton, is, used, in, fishing, nets, coffee, filters, tents, explosives, manufacture, see, nitrocellulose, cotton, paper, and, in, bookbinding, fire, hoses, were, once, made, of, cotton, the, cottonseed, which, remains, after, the, cotton, is, ginned, is, used, to, produce, cottonseed, oil, which, after, refining, can, be, consumed, by, humans, like, any, other, vegetable, oil, the, cottonseed, meal, that, is, left, generally, is, fed, to, ruminant, livestock, the, gossypol, remaining, in, the, meal, is, toxic, to, monogastric, animals, cottonseed, hulls, can, be, added, to, dairy, cattle, rations, for, roughage, during, the, american, slavery, period, cotton, root, bark, was, used, in, folk, remedies, as, an, abortifacient, that, is, to, induce, a, miscarriage, gossypol, was, one, of, the, many, substances, found, in, all, parts, of, the, cotton, plant, and, it, was, described, by, the, scientists, as, poisonous, pigment, it, also, appears, to, inhibit, the, development, of, sperm, or, even, restrict, the, mobility, of, the, sperm, also, it, is, thought, to, interfere, with, the, menstrual, cycle, by, restricting, the, release, of, certain, hormones, cotton, linters, are, fine, silky, fibers, which, adhere, to, the, seeds, of, the, cotton, plant, after, ginning, these, curly, fibers, typically, are, less, than, 1, 8, inch, 3, 2, mm, long, the, term, also, may, apply, to, the, longer, textile, fiber, staple, lint, as, well, as, the, shorter, fuzzy, fibers, from, some, upland, species, linters, are, traditionally, used, in, the, manufacture, of, paper, and, as, a, raw, material, in, the, manufacture, of, cellulose, in, the, uk, linters, are, referred, to, as, cotton, wool, a, less, technical, use, of, the, term, cotton, wool, in, the, uk, and, ireland, is, for, the, refined, product, known, as, absorbent, cotton, or, often, just, cotton, in, u, s, usage, fluffy, cotton, in, sheets, or, balls, used, for, medical, cosmetic, protective, packaging, and, many, other, practical, purposes, the, first, medical, use, of, cotton, wool, was, by, sampson, gamgee, at, the, queen, s, hospital, later, the, general, hospital, in, birmingham, england, long, staple, ls, cotton, is, cotton, of, a, longer, fibre, length, and, therefore, of, higher, quality, while, extra, long, staple, cotton, els, cotton, has, longer, fibre, length, still, and, of, even, higher, quality, the, name, egyptian, cotton, is, broadly, associated, high, quality, cottons, and, is, often, an, ls, or, less, often, an, els, cotton, nowadays, the, name, egyptian, cotton, refers, more, to, the, way, cotton, is, treated, and, threads, produced, rather, than, the, location, where, it, is, grown, the, american, cotton, variety, pima, cotton, is, often, compared, to, egyptian, cotton, as, both, are, used, in, high, quality, bed, sheets, and, other, cotton, products, while, pima, cotton, is, often, grown, in, the, american, southwest, the, pima, name, is, now, used, by, cotton, producing, nations, such, as, peru, australia, and, israel, not, all, products, bearing, the, pima, name, are, made, with, the, finest, cotton, american, grown, els, pima, cotton, is, trademarked, as, supima, cotton, kasturi, cotton, is, a, brand, building, initiative, for, indian, long, staple, cotton, by, the, indian, government, the, pib, issued, a, press, release, announcing, the, same, cottons, have, been, grown, as, ornamentals, or, novelties, due, to, their, showy, flowers, and, snowball, like, fruit, for, example, jumel, s, cotton, once, an, important, source, of, fiber, in, egypt, started, as, an, ornamental, however, agricultural, authorities, such, as, the, boll, weevil, eradication, program, in, the, united, states, discourage, using, cotton, as, an, ornamental, due, to, concerns, about, these, plants, harboring, pests, injurious, to, crops, the, largest, producers, of, cotton, as, of, 2017, are, india, and, china, with, annual, production, of, about, 18, 53, million, tonnes, and, 17, 14, million, tonnes, respectively, most, of, this, production, is, consumed, by, their, respective, textile, industries, the, largest, exporters, of, raw, cotton, are, the, united, states, with, sales, of, 4, 9, billion, and, africa, with, sales, of, 2, 1, billion, the, total, international, trade, is, estimated, to, be, 12, billion, africa, s, share, of, the, cotton, trade, has, doubled, since, 1980, neither, area, has, a, significant, domestic, textile, industry, textile, manufacturing, having, moved, to, developing, nations, in, eastern, and, south, asia, such, as, india, and, china, in, africa, cotton, is, grown, by, numerous, small, holders, dunavant, enterprises, based, in, memphis, tennessee, is, the, leading, cotton, broker, in, africa, with, hundreds, of, purchasing, agents, it, operates, cotton, gins, in, uganda, mozambique, and, zambia, in, zambia, it, often, offers, loans, for, seed, and, expenses, to, the, 180, 000, small, farmers, who, grow, cotton, for, it, as, well, as, advice, on, farming, methods, cargill, also, purchases, cotton, in, africa, for, export, the, 25, 000, cotton, growers, in, the, united, states, are, heavily, subsidized, at, the, rate, of, 2, billion, per, year, although, china, now, provides, the, highest, overall, level, of, cotton, sector, support, the, future, of, these, subsidies, is, uncertain, and, has, led, to, anticipatory, expansion, of, cotton, brokers, operations, in, africa, dunavant, expanded, in, africa, by, buying, out, local, operations, this, is, only, possible, in, former, british, colonies, and, mozambique, former, french, colonies, continue, to, maintain, tight, monopolies, inherited, from, their, former, colonialist, masters, on, cotton, purchases, at, low, fixed, prices, to, encourage, trade, and, organize, discussion, about, cotton, world, cotton, day, is, celebrated, every, october, 7, cotton, is, included, within, world, trade, organization, wto, activities, within, two, complementary, tracks, an, agreement, on, trade, in, cotton, formed, part, of, the, ministerial, declaration, concluding, the, world, trade, organization, ministerial, conference, of, 2005, in, 2022, world, production, of, cotton, was, 69, 7, million, tonnes, led, by, china, with, 26, of, the, total, other, major, producers, were, india, 22, and, the, united, states, 12, table, the, five, leading, exporters, of, cotton, in, 2019, are, 1, india, 2, the, united, states, 3, china, 4, brazil, and, 5, pakistan, in, india, the, states, of, maharashtra, 26, 63, gujarat, 17, 96, and, andhra, pradesh, 13, 75, and, also, madhya, pradesh, are, the, leading, cotton, producing, states, these, states, have, a, predominantly, tropical, wet, and, dry, climate, in, the, united, states, the, state, of, texas, led, in, total, production, as, of, 2004, while, the, state, of, california, had, the, highest, yield, per, acre, cotton, is, an, enormously, important, commodity, throughout, the, world, it, provides, livelihoods, for, up, to, 1, billion, people, including, 100, million, smallholder, farmers, who, cultivate, cotton, however, many, farmers, in, developing, countries, receive, a, low, price, for, their, produce, or, find, it, difficult, to, compete, with, developed, countries, this, has, led, to, an, international, dispute, see, brazil, united, states, cotton, dispute, on, 27, september, 2002, brazil, requested, consultations, with, the, us, regarding, prohibited, and, actionable, subsidies, provided, to, us, producers, users, and, or, exporters, of, upland, cotton, as, well, as, legislation, regulations, statutory, instruments, and, amendments, thereto, providing, such, subsidies, including, export, credits, grants, and, any, other, assistance, to, the, us, producers, users, and, exporters, of, upland, cotton, on, 8, september, 2004, the, panel, report, recommended, that, the, united, states, withdraw, export, credit, guarantees, and, payments, to, domestic, users, and, exporters, and, take, appropriate, steps, to, remove, the, adverse, effects, or, withdraw, the, mandatory, price, contingent, subsidy, measures, while, brazil, was, fighting, the, us, through, the, wto, s, dispute, settlement, mechanism, against, a, heavily, subsidized, cotton, industry, a, group, of, four, least, developed, african, countries, benin, burkina, faso, chad, and, mali, also, known, as, cotton, 4, have, been, the, leading, protagonist, for, the, reduction, of, us, cotton, subsidies, through, negotiations, the, four, introduced, a, sectoral, initiative, in, favour, of, cotton, presented, by, burkina, faso, s, president, blaise, compaor, during, the, trade, negotiations, committee, on, 10, june, 2003, in, addition, to, concerns, over, subsidies, the, cotton, industries, of, some, countries, are, criticized, for, employing, child, labor, and, damaging, workers, health, by, exposure, to, pesticides, used, in, production, the, environmental, justice, foundation, has, campaigned, against, the, prevalent, use, of, forced, child, and, adult, labor, in, cotton, production, in, uzbekistan, the, world, s, third, largest, cotton, exporter, the, international, production, and, trade, situation, has, led, to, fair, trade, cotton, clothing, and, footwear, joining, a, rapidly, growing, market, for, organic, clothing, fair, fashion, or, ethical, fashion, the, fair, trade, system, was, initiated, in, 2005, with, producers, from, cameroon, mali, and, senegal, with, the, association, max, havelaar, france, playing, a, lead, role, in, the, establishment, of, this, segment, of, the, fair, trade, system, in, conjunction, with, fairtrade, international, and, the, french, organisation, dagris, d, veloppement, des, agro, industries, du, sud, cotton, is, bought, and, sold, by, investors, and, price, speculators, as, a, tradable, commodity, on, two, different, commodity, exchanges, in, the, united, states, of, america, a, temperature, range, of, 25, to, 35, c, 77, to, 95, f, is, the, optimal, range, for, mold, development, at, temperatures, below, 0, c, 32, f, rotting, of, wet, cotton, stops, damaged, cotton, is, sometimes, stored, at, these, temperatures, to, prevent, further, deterioration, egypt, has, a, unique, climatic, temperature, that, the, soil, and, the, temperature, provide, an, exceptional, environment, for, cotton, to, grow, rapidly, depending, upon, the, origin, the, chemical, composition, of, cotton, is, as, follows, cotton, has, a, more, complex, structure, among, the, other, crops, a, matured, cotton, fiber, is, a, single, elongated, complete, dried, multilayer, cell, that, develops, in, the, surface, layer, of, cottonseed, it, has, the, following, parts, dead, cotton, is, a, term, that, refers, to, unripe, cotton, fibers, that, do, not, absorb, dye, dead, cotton, is, immature, cotton, that, has, poor, dye, affinity, and, appears, as, white, specks, on, a, dyed, fabric, when, cotton, fibers, are, analyzed, and, assessed, through, a, microscope, dead, fibers, appear, differently, dead, cotton, fibers, have, thin, cell, walls, in, contrast, mature, fibers, have, more, cellulose, and, a, greater, degree, of, cell, wall, thickening, there, is, a, public, effort, to, sequence, the, genome, of, cotton, it, was, started, in, 2007, by, a, consortium, of, public, researchers, their, aim, is, to, sequence, the, genome, of, cultivated, tetraploid, cotton, tetraploid, means, that, its, nucleus, has, two, separate, genomes, called, a, and, d, the, consortium, agreed, to, first, sequence, the, d, genome, wild, relative, of, cultivated, cotton, g, raimondii, a, central, american, species, because, it, is, small, and, has, few, repetitive, elements, it, has, nearly, one, third, of, the, bases, of, tetraploid, cotton, and, each, chromosome, occurs, only, once, then, the, a, genome, of, g, arboreum, would, be, sequenced, its, genome, is, roughly, twice, that, of, g, raimondii, part, of, the, difference, in, size, is, due, to, the, amplification, of, retrotransposons, gorge, after, both, diploid, genomes, are, assembled, they, would, be, used, as, models, for, sequencing, the, genomes, of, tetraploid, cultivated, species, without, knowing, the, diploid, genomes, the, euchromatic, dna, sequences, of, ad, genomes, would, co, assemble, and, their, repetitive, elements, would, assemble, independently, into, a, and, d, sequences, respectively, there, would, be, no, way, to, untangle, the, mess, of, ad, sequences, without, comparing, them, to, their, diploid, counterparts, the, public, sector, effort, continues, with, the, goal, to, create, a, high, quality, draft, genome, sequence, from, reads, generated, by, all, sources, the, effort, has, generated, sanger, reads, of, bacs, fosmids, and, plasmids, as, well, as, 454, reads, these, later, types, of, reads, will, be, instrumental, in, assembling, an, initial, draft, of, the, d, genome, in, 2010, the, companies, monsanto, and, illumina, completed, enough, illumina, sequencing, to, cover, the, d, genome, of, g, raimondii, about, 50x, they, announced, that, they, would, donate, their, raw, reads, to, the, public, this, public, relations, effort, gave, them, some, recognition, for, sequencing, the, cotton, genome, once, the, d, genome, is, assembled, from, all, of, this, raw, material, it, will, undoubtedly, assist, in, the, assembly, of, the, ad, genomes, of, cultivated, varieties, of, cotton, but, much, work, remains, as, of, 2014, at, least, one, assembled, cotton, genome, had, been, reported
