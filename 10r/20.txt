https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication
domestication, is, a, multi, generational, mutualistic, relationship, in, which, an, animal, species, such, as, humans, or, leafcutter, ants, takes, over, control, and, care, of, another, species, such, as, sheep, or, fungi, to, obtain, from, them, a, steady, supply, of, resources, such, as, meat, milk, or, labor, the, process, is, gradual, and, geographically, diffuse, based, on, trial, and, error, the, first, animal, to, be, domesticated, by, humans, was, the, dog, as, a, commensal, at, least, 15, 000, years, ago, other, animals, including, goats, sheep, and, cows, were, domesticated, starting, around, 11, 000, years, ago, among, birds, the, chicken, was, first, domesticated, in, east, asia, seemingly, for, cockfighting, some, 7, 000, years, ago, the, horse, came, under, domestication, around, 5, 500, years, ago, in, central, asia, as, a, working, animal, among, invertebrates, the, silkworm, and, the, western, honey, bee, were, domesticated, over, 5, 000, years, ago, for, silk, and, honey, respectively, the, domestication, of, plants, began, around, 13, 000, 11, 000, years, ago, with, cereals, such, as, wheat, and, barley, in, the, middle, east, alongside, crops, such, as, lentil, pea, chickpea, and, flax, beginning, around, 10, 000, years, ago, indigenous, peoples, in, the, americas, began, to, cultivate, peanuts, squash, maize, potatoes, cotton, and, cassava, rice, was, first, domesticated, in, china, some, about, 9, 000, years, ago, in, africa, crops, such, as, sorghum, were, domesticated, agriculture, developed, in, some, 13, centres, around, the, world, domesticating, different, crops, and, animals, domestication, affected, genes, for, behavior, in, animals, making, them, less, aggressive, in, plants, domestication, affected, genes, for, morphology, such, as, increasing, seed, size, and, stopping, the, shattering, of, cereal, seedheads, such, changes, both, make, domesticated, organisms, easier, to, handle, and, reduce, their, ability, to, survive, in, the, wild, domestication, not, to, be, confused, with, the, taming, of, an, individual, animal, is, from, the, latin, domesticus, belonging, to, the, house, the, term, remained, loosely, defined, until, the, 21st, century, when, the, american, archaeologist, melinda, a, zeder, defined, it, as, a, long, term, relationship, in, which, humans, take, over, control, and, care, of, another, organism, to, gain, a, predictable, supply, of, a, resource, resulting, in, mutual, benefits, she, noted, further, that, it, is, not, synonymous, with, agriculture, since, agriculture, depends, on, domesticated, organisms, but, does, not, automatically, result, from, domestication, michael, d, purugganan, notes, that, domestication, has, been, hard, to, define, despite, the, instinctual, consensus, that, it, means, the, plants, and, animals, found, under, the, care, of, humans, that, provide, us, with, benefits, and, which, have, evolved, under, our, control, he, comments, that, insects, such, as, termites, ambrosia, beetles, and, leafcutter, ants, have, domesticated, some, species, of, fungi, and, notes, further, that, other, groups, such, as, weeds, and, commensals, have, wrongly, been, called, domesticated, starting, from, zeder, s, definition, purugganan, proposes, a, broad, definition, a, coevolutionary, process, that, arises, from, a, mutualism, in, which, one, species, the, domesticator, constructs, an, environment, where, it, actively, manages, both, the, survival, and, reproduction, of, another, species, the, domesticate, in, order, to, provide, the, former, with, resources, and, or, services, he, comments, that, this, adds, niche, construction, to, the, activities, of, the, domesticator, domestication, syndrome, is, the, suite, of, phenotypic, traits, that, arose, during, the, initial, domestication, process, and, which, distinguish, crops, from, their, wild, ancestors, it, can, also, mean, a, set, of, differences, now, observed, in, domesticated, animals, not, necessarily, reflecting, the, initial, domestication, process, the, changes, include, increased, docility, and, tameness, coat, coloration, reductions, in, tooth, size, craniofacial, morphology, ear, and, tail, form, e, g, floppy, ears, estrus, cycles, levels, of, adrenocorticotropic, hormone, and, neurotransmitters, prolongations, in, juvenile, behavior, and, reductions, in, brain, size, and, of, particular, brain, regions, the, domestication, of, animals, and, plants, was, triggered, by, the, climatic, and, environmental, changes, that, occurred, after, the, peak, of, the, last, glacial, maximum, and, which, continue, to, this, present, day, these, changes, made, obtaining, food, by, hunting, and, gathering, difficult, the, first, animal, to, be, domesticated, was, the, dog, at, least, 15, 000, years, ago, the, younger, dryas, 12, 900, years, ago, was, a, period, of, intense, cold, and, aridity, that, put, pressure, on, humans, to, intensify, their, foraging, strategies, but, did, not, favour, agriculture, by, the, beginning, of, the, holocene, 11, 700, years, ago, a, warmer, climate, and, increasing, human, populations, led, to, small, scale, animal, and, plant, domestication, and, an, increased, supply, of, food, the, appearance, of, the, domestic, dog, in, the, archaeological, record, at, least, 15, 000, years, ago, was, followed, by, domestication, of, livestock, and, of, crops, such, as, wheat, and, barley, the, invention, of, agriculture, and, the, transition, of, humans, from, foraging, to, farming, in, different, places, and, times, across, the, planet, for, instance, small, scale, trial, cultivation, of, cereals, began, some, 28, 000, years, ago, at, the, ohalo, ii, site, in, israel, in, the, fertile, crescent, 11, 000, 10, 000, years, ago, zooarchaeology, indicates, that, goats, pigs, sheep, and, taurine, cattle, were, the, first, livestock, to, be, domesticated, two, thousand, years, later, humped, zebu, cattle, were, domesticated, in, what, is, today, baluchistan, in, pakistan, in, east, asia, 8, 000, years, ago, pigs, were, domesticated, from, wild, boar, genetically, different, from, those, found, in, the, fertile, crescent, the, cat, was, domesticated, in, the, fertile, crescent, perhaps, 10, 000, years, ago, from, european, wildcats, possibly, to, control, rodents, that, were, damaging, stored, food, the, domestication, of, animals, is, the, relationship, between, non, human, animals, and, humans, who, have, an, influence, on, their, care, and, reproduction, in, his, 1868, book, the, variation, of, animals, and, plants, under, domestication, charles, darwin, recognized, the, small, number, of, traits, that, made, domestic, species, different, from, their, wild, ancestors, he, was, also, the, first, to, recognize, the, difference, between, conscious, selective, breeding, in, which, humans, directly, select, for, desirable, traits, and, unconscious, selection, in, which, traits, evolve, as, a, by, product, of, natural, selection, or, from, selection, on, other, traits, there, is, a, difference, between, domestic, and, wild, populations, some, of, these, differences, constitute, the, domestication, syndrome, traits, presumed, essential, in, the, early, stages, of, domestication, while, others, represent, later, improvement, traits, domesticated, animals, tend, to, be, smaller, and, less, aggressive, than, their, wild, counterparts, other, common, traits, are, floppy, ears, a, smaller, brain, and, a, shorter, muzzle, domestication, traits, are, generally, fixed, within, all, domesticates, and, were, selected, during, the, initial, episode, of, domestication, of, that, animal, or, plant, whereas, improvement, traits, are, present, only, in, a, proportion, of, domesticates, though, they, may, be, fixed, in, individual, breeds, or, regional, populations, certain, animal, species, and, certain, individuals, within, those, species, make, better, candidates, for, domestication, because, of, their, behavioral, characteristics, the, beginnings, of, animal, domestication, involved, a, protracted, coevolutionary, process, with, multiple, stages, along, different, pathways, there, are, three, proposed, major, pathways, that, most, animal, domesticates, followed, into, domestication, humans, did, not, intend, to, domesticate, animals, from, either, the, commensal, or, prey, pathways, or, at, least, they, did, not, envision, a, domesticated, animal, would, result, from, it, in, both, of, those, cases, humans, became, entangled, with, these, species, as, the, relationship, between, them, intensified, and, humans, role, in, their, survival, and, reproduction, gradually, led, to, formalized, animal, husbandry, although, the, directed, pathway, for, draft, and, riding, animals, proceeded, from, capture, to, taming, the, other, two, pathways, are, not, as, goal, oriented, and, archaeological, records, suggest, that, they, took, place, over, much, longer, time, frames, unlike, other, domestic, species, selected, primarily, for, production, related, traits, dogs, were, initially, selected, for, their, behaviors, the, dog, was, domesticated, long, before, other, animals, becoming, established, across, eurasia, before, the, end, of, the, late, pleistocene, era, well, before, agriculture, the, archaeological, and, genetic, data, suggest, that, long, term, bidirectional, gene, flow, between, wild, and, domestic, stocks, such, as, in, donkeys, horses, new, and, old, world, camelids, goats, sheep, and, pigs, was, common, human, selection, for, domestic, traits, likely, counteracted, the, homogenizing, effect, of, gene, flow, from, wild, boars, into, pigs, and, created, domestication, islands, in, the, genome, the, same, process, may, apply, to, other, domesticated, animals, the, 2023, parasite, mediated, domestication, hypothesis, suggests, that, endoparasites, such, as, helminths, and, protozoa, could, have, mediated, the, domestication, of, mammals, domestication, involves, taming, which, has, an, endocrine, component, and, parasites, can, modify, endocrine, activity, and, micrornas, genes, for, resistance, to, parasites, might, be, linked, to, those, for, the, domestication, syndrome, it, is, predicted, that, domestic, animals, are, less, resistant, to, parasites, than, their, wild, relatives, domesticated, birds, principally, mean, poultry, raised, for, meat, and, eggs, some, galliformes, chicken, turkey, guineafowl, and, anseriformes, waterfowl, ducks, geese, and, swans, also, widely, domesticated, are, cagebirds, such, as, songbirds, and, parrots, these, are, kept, both, for, pleasure, and, for, use, in, research, the, domestic, pigeon, has, been, used, both, for, food, and, as, a, means, of, communication, between, far, flung, places, through, the, exploitation, of, the, pigeon, s, homing, instinct, research, suggests, it, was, domesticated, as, early, as, 10, 000, years, ago, chicken, fossils, in, china, have, been, dated, to, 7, 400, years, ago, the, chicken, s, wild, ancestor, is, gallus, gallus, the, red, junglefowl, of, southeast, asia, the, species, appears, to, have, been, kept, initially, for, cockfighting, rather, than, for, food, two, insects, the, silkworm, and, the, western, honey, bee, have, been, domesticated, for, over, 5, 000, years, often, for, commercial, use, the, silkworm, is, raised, for, the, silk, threads, wound, around, its, pupal, cocoon, the, western, honey, bee, for, honey, and, from, the, 20th, century, for, pollination, of, crops, several, other, invertebrates, have, been, domesticated, both, terrestrial, and, aquatic, including, some, such, as, drosophila, melanogaster, fruit, flies, and, the, freshwater, cnidarian, hydra, for, research, into, genetics, and, physiology, few, have, a, long, history, of, domestication, most, are, used, for, food, or, other, products, such, as, shellac, and, cochineal, the, phyla, involved, are, cnidaria, platyhelminthes, for, biological, pest, control, annelida, mollusca, arthropoda, marine, crustaceans, as, well, as, insects, and, spiders, and, echinodermata, while, many, marine, mollusks, are, used, for, food, only, a, few, have, been, domesticated, including, squid, cuttlefish, and, octopus, all, used, in, research, on, behaviour, and, neurology, terrestrial, snails, in, the, genera, helix, are, raised, for, food, several, parasitic, or, parasitoidal, insects, including, the, fly, eucelatoria, the, beetle, chrysolina, and, the, wasp, aphytis, are, raised, for, biological, control, conscious, or, unconscious, artificial, selection, has, many, effects, on, species, under, domestication, variability, can, readily, be, lost, by, inbreeding, selection, against, undesired, traits, or, genetic, drift, while, in, drosophila, variability, in, eclosion, time, when, adults, emerge, has, increased, humans, foraged, for, wild, cereals, seeds, and, nuts, thousands, of, years, before, they, were, domesticated, wild, wheat, and, barley, for, example, were, gathered, in, the, levant, at, least, 23, 000, years, ago, neolithic, societies, in, west, asia, first, began, to, cultivate, and, then, domesticate, some, of, these, plants, around, 13, 000, to, 11, 000, years, ago, the, founder, crops, of, the, west, asian, neolithic, included, cereals, emmer, einkorn, wheat, barley, pulses, lentil, pea, chickpea, bitter, vetch, and, flax, other, plants, were, independently, domesticated, in, 13, centers, of, origin, subdivided, into, 24, areas, of, the, americas, africa, and, asia, the, middle, east, south, asia, the, far, east, and, new, guinea, and, wallacea, in, some, thirteen, of, these, regions, people, began, to, cultivate, grasses, and, grains, rice, was, first, cultivated, in, east, asia, sorghum, was, widely, cultivated, in, sub, saharan, africa, while, peanuts, squash, cotton, maize, potatoes, and, cassava, were, domesticated, in, the, americas, continued, domestication, was, gradual, and, geographically, diffuse, happening, in, many, small, steps, and, spread, over, a, wide, area, on, the, evidence, of, both, archaeology, and, genetics, it, was, a, process, of, intermittent, trial, and, error, and, often, resulted, in, diverging, traits, and, characteristics, whereas, domestication, of, animals, impacted, most, on, the, genes, that, controlled, behavior, that, of, plants, impacted, most, on, the, genes, that, controlled, morphology, seed, size, plant, architecture, dispersal, mechanisms, and, physiology, timing, of, germination, or, ripening, as, in, the, domestication, of, wheat, wild, wheat, shatters, and, falls, to, the, ground, to, reseed, itself, when, ripe, but, domesticated, wheat, stays, on, the, stem, for, easier, harvesting, this, change, was, possible, because, of, a, random, mutation, in, the, wild, populations, at, the, beginning, of, wheat, s, cultivation, wheat, with, this, mutation, was, harvested, more, frequently, and, became, the, seed, for, the, next, crop, therefore, without, realizing, it, early, farmers, selected, for, this, mutation, the, result, is, domesticated, wheat, which, relies, on, farmers, for, its, reproduction, and, dissemination, domesticated, plants, differ, from, their, wild, relatives, in, many, ways, including, plant, defenses, against, herbivory, such, as, thorns, spines, and, prickles, poison, protective, coverings, and, sturdiness, may, have, been, reduced, in, domesticated, plants, this, would, make, them, more, likely, to, be, eaten, by, herbivores, unless, protected, by, humans, but, there, is, only, weak, support, for, most, of, this, farmers, did, select, for, reduced, bitterness, and, lower, toxicity, and, for, food, quality, which, likely, increased, crop, palatability, to, herbivores, as, to, humans, however, a, survey, of, 29, plant, domestications, found, that, crops, were, as, well, defended, against, two, major, insect, pests, beet, armyworm, and, green, peach, aphid, both, chemically, e, g, with, bitter, substances, and, morphologically, e, g, with, toughness, as, their, wild, ancestors, during, domestication, crop, species, undergo, intense, artificial, selection, that, alters, their, genomes, establishing, core, traits, that, define, them, as, domesticated, such, as, increased, grain, size, comparison, of, the, coding, dna, of, chromosome, 8, in, rice, between, fragrant, and, non, fragrant, varieties, showed, that, aromatic, and, fragrant, rice, including, basmati, and, jasmine, is, derived, from, an, ancestral, rice, domesticate, that, suffered, a, deletion, in, exon, 7, which, altered, the, coding, for, betaine, aldehyde, dehydrogenase, badh2, comparison, of, the, potato, genome, with, that, of, other, plants, located, genes, for, resistance, to, potato, blight, caused, by, phytophthora, infestans, in, coconut, genomic, analysis, of, 10, microsatellite, loci, of, noncoding, dna, found, two, episodes, of, domestication, based, on, differences, between, individuals, in, the, indian, ocean, and, those, in, the, pacific, ocean, the, coconut, experienced, a, founder, effect, where, a, small, number, of, individuals, with, low, diversity, founded, the, modern, population, permanently, losing, much, of, the, genetic, variation, of, the, wild, population, population, bottlenecks, which, reduced, variation, throughout, the, genome, at, some, later, date, after, domestication, are, evident, in, crops, such, as, pearl, millet, cotton, common, bean, and, lima, bean, in, wheat, domestication, involved, repeated, hybridization, and, polyploidy, these, steps, are, large, and, essentially, instantaneous, changes, to, the, genome, and, the, epigenome, enabling, a, rapid, evolutionary, response, to, artificial, selection, polyploidy, increases, the, number, of, chromosomes, bringing, new, combinations, of, genes, and, alleles, which, in, turn, enable, further, changes, such, as, by, chromosomal, crossover, the, microbiome, the, collection, of, microorganisms, inhabiting, the, surface, and, internal, tissue, of, plants, is, affected, by, domestication, this, includes, changes, in, microbial, species, composition, and, diversity, plant, lineage, including, speciation, domestication, and, breeding, have, shaped, plant, endophytes, phylosymbiosis, in, similar, patterns, as, plant, genes, several, species, of, fungi, have, been, domesticated, for, use, directly, as, food, or, in, fermentation, to, produce, foods, and, drugs, the, cultivated, mushroom, agaricus, bisporus, is, widely, grown, for, food, the, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, have, been, used, for, thousands, of, years, to, ferment, beer, and, wine, and, to, leaven, bread, mould, fungi, including, penicillium, are, used, to, mature, cheeses, and, other, dairy, products, as, well, as, to, make, drugs, such, as, antibiotics, selection, of, animals, for, visible, traits, may, have, undesired, consequences, for, the, genetics, of, domestic, animals, a, side, effect, of, domestication, has, been, zoonotic, diseases, for, example, cattle, have, given, humanity, various, viral, poxes, measles, and, tuberculosis, pigs, and, ducks, have, contributed, influenza, and, horses, have, brought, the, rhinoviruses, many, parasites, too, have, their, origins, in, domestic, animals, alongside, these, the, advent, of, domestication, resulted, in, denser, human, populations, which, provided, ripe, conditions, for, pathogens, to, reproduce, mutate, spread, and, eventually, find, a, new, host, in, humans, scholars, have, expressed, widely, differing, viewpoints, on, domestication, s, effects, on, society, anarcho, primitivism, critiques, domestication, as, destroying, the, supposed, primitive, state, of, harmony, with, nature, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, and, replacing, it, possibly, violently, or, by, enslavement, with, a, social, hierarchy, as, property, and, power, emerged, the, dialectal, naturalist, murray, bookchin, has, argued, that, domestication, of, animals, in, turn, meant, the, domestication, of, humanity, both, parties, being, unavoidably, altered, by, their, relationship, with, each, other, the, sociologist, david, nibert, asserts, that, the, domestication, of, animals, involved, violence, against, animals, and, damage, to, the, environment, this, in, turn, he, argues, corrupted, human, ethics, and, paved, the, way, for, conquest, extermination, displacement, repression, coerced, and, enslaved, servitude, gender, subordination, and, sexual, exploitation, and, hunger, domesticated, ecosystems, provide, food, reduce, predator, and, natural, dangers, and, promote, commerce, but, their, creation, has, resulted, in, habitat, alteration, or, loss, and, multiple, extinctions, commencing, in, the, late, pleistocene, domestication, reduces, genetic, diversity, of, the, domesticated, population, especially, of, alleles, of, genes, targeted, by, selection, one, reason, is, a, population, bottleneck, created, by, artificially, selecting, the, most, desirable, individuals, to, breed, from, most, of, the, domesticated, strain, is, then, born, from, just, a, few, ancestors, creating, a, situation, similar, to, the, founder, effect, domesticated, populations, such, as, of, dogs, rice, sunflowers, maize, and, horses, have, an, increased, mutation, load, as, expected, in, a, population, bottleneck, where, genetic, drift, is, enhanced, by, the, small, population, size, mutations, can, also, be, fixed, in, a, population, by, a, selective, sweep, mutational, load, can, be, increased, by, reduced, selective, pressure, against, moderately, harmful, traits, when, reproductive, fitness, is, controlled, by, human, management, however, there, is, evidence, against, a, bottleneck, in, crops, such, as, barley, maize, and, sorghum, where, genetic, diversity, slowly, declined, rather, than, showing, a, rapid, initial, fall, at, the, point, of, domestication, further, the, genetic, diversity, of, these, crops, was, regularly, replenished, from, the, natural, population, similar, evidence, exists, for, horses, pigs, cows, and, goats, at, least, three, groups, of, insects, namely, ambrosia, beetles, leafcutter, ants, and, termites, have, domesticated, species, of, fungi, ambrosia, beetles, in, the, weevil, subfamilies, scolytinae, and, platypodinae, excavate, tunnels, in, dead, or, stressed, trees, into, which, they, introduce, fungal, gardens, their, sole, source, of, nutrition, after, landing, on, a, suitable, tree, an, ambrosia, beetle, excavates, a, tunnel, in, which, it, releases, its, fungal, symbiont, the, fungus, penetrates, the, plant, s, xylem, tissue, extracts, nutrients, from, it, and, concentrates, the, nutrients, on, and, near, the, surface, of, the, beetle, gallery, ambrosia, fungi, are, typically, poor, wood, degraders, and, instead, utilize, less, demanding, nutrients, symbiotic, fungi, produce, and, detoxify, ethanol, which, is, an, attractant, for, ambrosia, beetles, and, likely, prevents, the, growth, of, antagonistic, pathogens, and, selects, for, other, beneficial, symbionts, ambrosia, beetles, mainly, colonise, wood, of, recently, dead, trees, the, leafcutter, ants, are, any, of, some, 47, species, of, leaf, chewing, ants, in, the, genera, acromyrmex, and, atta, the, ants, carry, the, discs, of, leaves, that, they, have, cut, back, to, their, nest, where, they, feed, the, leaf, material, to, the, fungi, that, they, tend, some, of, these, fungi, are, not, fully, domesticated, the, fungi, farmed, by, mycocepurus, smithii, constantly, produce, spores, that, are, not, useful, to, the, ants, which, eat, fungal, hyphae, instead, the, process, of, domestication, by, atta, ants, on, the, other, hand, is, complete, it, took, 30, million, years, termites, eat, decaying, plant, material, such, as, wood, leaf, litter, and, soil, humus, many, species, of, termite, have, a, specialized, midgut, with, enzymes, able, to, break, down, cellulose, fiber, termites, rely, primarily, upon, a, symbiotic, microbial, community, that, includes, bacteria, flagellate, protists, such, as, metamonads, and, hypermastigids, this, community, provides, the, enzymes, that, digest, the, cellulose, allowing, the, insects, to, absorb, the, end, products, for, their, own, use
