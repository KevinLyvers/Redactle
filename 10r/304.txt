foundation, of, houses, today, as, far, as, the, idea, of, the, home, is, concerned, the, home, of, the, home, is, the, netherlands, this, idea, s, crystallization, might, be, dated, to, the, first, three, quarters, of, the, 17th, century, when, the, dutch, netherlands, amassed, the, unprecedented, and, unrivalled, accumulation, of, capital, and, emptied, their, purses, into, domestic, space, in, the, middle, ages, the, manor, houses, facilitated, different, activities, and, events, furthermore, the, houses, accommodated, numerous, people, including, family, relatives, employees, servants, and, their, guests, their, lifestyles, were, largely, communal, as, areas, such, as, the, great, hall, enforced, the, custom, of, dining, and, meetings, and, the, solar, intended, for, shared,

houses, most, rooms, of, the, palazzo, contained, no, purpose, yet, were, given, several, doors, these, doors, adjoined, rooms, in, which, robin, evans, describes, as, a, matrix, of, discrete, but, thoroughly, interconnected, chambers, the, layout, allowed, occupants, to, freely, walk, room, to, room, from, one, door, to, another, thus, breaking, the, boundaries, of, privacy, an, early, example, of, the, segregation, of, rooms, and, consequent, enhancement, of, privacy, may, be, found, in, 1597, at, the, beaufort, house, built, in, chelsea, london, it, was, designed, by, english, architect, john, thorpe, who, wrote, on, his, plans, a, long, entry, through, all, the, separation, of, the, passageway, from, the, room, developed, the, function, of, the, corridor, this, new, extension, was, revolutionary, at, the, time, allowing, the, integration, of, one, door, per, room, in, which, all, universally, connected, to, the, same, corridor, english, architect, sir, roger, pratt, states, the, common, way, in, the, middle, through, the, whole, length, of, the, house, the, offices, from, one, molesting, the, other, by, continual, passing, through, them, social, hierarchies, within, the, 17th, century, were, highly, regarded, as, architecture, was, able, to, epitomize, the, servants, and, the, upper, class, more, privacy, is, offered, to, the, occupant, as, pratt, further, claims, the, ordinary, servants, may, never, publicly, appear, in, passing, to, and, fro, for, their, occasions, there, this, social, divide, between, rich, and, poor, favored, the, physical, integration, of, the, corridor, into, housing, by, the, 19th, century, sociologist, witold, rybczynski, wrote, the, subdivision, of, the, house, into, day, and, night, uses, and, into, formal, and, informal, areas, had, begun, rooms, were, changed, from, public, to, private, as, single, entryways, forced, notions, of, entering, a, room, with, a, specific, purpose, compared, to, the, large, scaled, houses, in, england, and, the, renaissance, the, 17th, century, dutch, house, was, smaller, and, was, only, inhabited, by, up, to, four, to, five, members, this, was, because, they, embraced, self, reliance, in, contrast, to, the, dependence, on, servants, and, a, design, for, a, lifestyle, centered, on, the, family, it, was, important, for, the, dutch, to, separate, work, from, domesticity, as, the, home, became, an, escape, and, a, place, of, comfort, this, way, of, living, and, the, home, has, been, noted, as, highly, similar, to, the, contemporary, family, and, their, dwellings, by, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, the, house, layout, was, transformed, to, become, employment, free, enforcing, these, ideas, for, the, future, this, came, in, favour, for, the, industrial, revolution, gaining, large, scale, factory, production, and, workers, the, house, layout, of, the, dutch, and, its, functions, are, still, relevant, today, in, the, american, context, some, professions, such, as, doctors, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, typically, operated, out, of, the, front, room, or, parlor, or, had, a, two, room, office, on, their, property, which, was, detached, from, the, house, by, the, mid, 20th, century, the, increase, in, high, tech, equipment, created, a, marked, shift, whereby, the, contemporary, doctor, typically, worked, from, an, office, or, hospital, technology, and, electronic, systems, has, caused, privacy, issues, and, issues, with, segregating, personal, life, from, remote, work, technological, advances, of, surveillance, and, communications, allow, insight, of, personal, habits, and, private, lives, as, a, result, the, private, becomes, ever, more, public, the, desire, for, a, protective, home, life, increases, fuelled, by, the, very, media, that, undermine, it, writes, jonathan, hill, work, has, been, altered, by, the, increase, of, communications, the, deluge, of, information, has, expressed, the, efforts, of, work, conveniently, gaining, access, inside, the, house, although, commuting, is, reduced, the, desire, to, separate, working, and, living, remains, apparent, on, the, other, hand, some, architects, have, designed, homes, in, which, eating, working, and, living, are, brought, together, in, many, parts, of, the, world, houses, are, constructed, using, scavenged, materials, in, manila, s, payatas, neighborhood, slum, houses, are, often, made, of, material, sourced, from, a, nearby, garbage, dump, in, dakar, it, is, common, to, see, houses, made, of, recycled, materials, standing, atop, a, mixture, of, garbage, and, sand, which, serves, as, a, foundation, the, garbage, sand, mixture, is, also, used, to, protect, the, house, from, flooding, in, the, united, states, modern, house, construction, techniques, include, light, frame, construction, in, areas, with, access, to, supplies, of, wood, and, adobe, or, sometimes, rammed, earth, construction, in, arid, regions, with, scarce, wood, resources, some, areas, use, brick, almost, exclusively, and, quarried, stone, has, long, provided, foundations, and, walls, to, some, extent, aluminum, and, steel, have, displaced, some, traditional, building, materials, increasingly, popular, alternative, construction, materials, include, insulating, concrete, forms, foam, forms, filled, with, concrete, structural, insulated, panels, foam, panels, faced, with, oriented, strand, board, or, fiber, cement, light, gauge, steel, and, steel, framing, more, generally, people, often, build, houses, out, of, the, nearest, available, material, and, often, tradition, or, culture, govern, construction, materials, so, whole, towns, areas, counties, or, even, states, countries, may, be, built, out, of, one, main, type, of, material, for, example, a, large, portion, of, american, houses, use, wood, while, most, british, and, many, european, houses, use, stone, brick, or, mud, in, the, early, 20th, century, some, house, designers, started, using, prefabrication,

then, later, whole, walls, were, prefabricated, and, carried, to, the, construction, site, the, original, impetus, was, to, use, the, labor, force, inside, a, shelter, during, inclement, weather, more, recently, builders, have, begun, to, collaborate, with, structural, engineers, who, use, finite, element, analysis, to, design, prefabricated, steel, framed, homes, with, known, resistance, to, high, wind, loads, and, seismic, forces, these, newer, products, provide, labor, savings, more, consistent, quality, and, possibly, accelerated, construction, processes, lesser, used, construction, methods, have, gained, or, regained, popularity, in, recent, years, though, not, in, wide, use, these, methods, frequently, appeal, to, homeowners, who, may, become, actively, involved, in, the,
