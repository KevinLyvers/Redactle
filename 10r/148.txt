a, vacuum, tube, electron, tube, valve, british, usage, or, tube, north, america, is, a, device, that, controls, electric, current, flow, in, a, high, vacuum, between, electrodes, to, which, an, electric, potential, difference, has, been, applied, the, type, known, as, a, thermionic, tube, or, thermionic, valve, utilizes, thermionic, emission, of, electrons, from, a, hot, cathode, for, fundamental, electronic, functions, such, as, signal, amplification, and, current, rectification, non, thermionic, types, such, as, a, vacuum, phototube, however, achieve, electron, emission, through, the, photoelectric, effect, and, are, used, for, such, purposes, as, the, detection, of, light, intensities, in, both, types, the, electrons, are, accelerated, from, the, cathode, to, the, anode, by, the, electric, field, in, the, tube, the, simplest, vacuum, tube, the, diode, i, e, fleming, valve, was, invented, in, 1904, by, john, ambrose, fleming, it, contains, only, a, heated, electron, emitting, cathode, and, an, anode, electrons, can, flow, in, only, one, direction, through, the, device, from, the, cathode, to, the, anode, adding, one, or, more, control, grids, within, the, tube, allows, the, current, between, the, cathode, and, anode, to, be, controlled, by, the, voltage, on, the, grids, these, devices, became, a, key, component, of, electronic, circuits, for, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, they, were, crucial, to, the, development, of, radio, television, radar, sound, recording, and, reproduction, long, distance, telephone, networks, and, analog, and, early, digital, computers, although, some, applications, had, used, earlier, technologies, such, as, the, spark, gap, transmitter, for, radio, or, mechanical, computers, for, computing, it, was, the, invention, of, the, thermionic, vacuum, tube, that, made, these, technologies, widespread, and, practical, and, created, the, discipline, of, electronics, in, the, 1940s, the, invention, of, semiconductor, devices, made, it, possible, to, produce, solid, state, devices, which, are, smaller, safer, cooler, and, more, efficient, reliable, durable, and, economical, than, thermionic, tubes, beginning, in, the, mid, 1960s, thermionic, tubes, were, being, replaced, by, the, transistor, however, the, cathode, ray, tube, crt, remained, the, basis, for, television, monitors, and, oscilloscopes, until, the, early, 21st, century, thermionic, tubes, are, still, employed, in, some, applications, such, as, the, magnetron, used, in, microwave, ovens, certain, high, frequency, amplifiers, and, high, end, audio, amplifiers, which, many, audio, enthusiasts, prefer, for, their, warmer, tube, sound, and, amplifiers, for, electric, musical, instruments, such, as, guitars, for, desired, effects, such, as, overdriving, them, to, achieve, a, certain, sound, or, tone, not, all, electronic, circuit, valves, electron, tubes, are, vacuum, tubes, gas, filled, tubes, are, similar, devices, but, containing, a, gas, typically, at, low, pressure, which, exploit, phenomena, related, to, electric, discharge, in, gases, usually, without, a, heater, one, classification, of, thermionic, vacuum, tubes, is, by, the, number, of, active, electrodes, a, device, with, two, active, elements, is, a, diode, usually, used, for, rectification, devices, with, three, elements, are, triodes, used, for, amplification, and, switching, additional, electrodes, create, tetrodes, pentodes, and, so, forth, which, have, multiple, additional, functions, made, possible, by, the, additional, controllable, electrodes, other, classifications, are, vacuum, tubes, may, have, other, components, and, functions, than, those, described, above, and, are, described, elsewhere, these, include, as, cathode, ray, tubes, which, create, a, beam, of, electrons, for, display, purposes, such, as, the, television, picture, tube, in, electron, microscopy, and, in, electron, beam, lithography, x, ray, tubes, phototubes, and, photomultipliers, which, rely, on, electron, flow, through, a, vacuum, where, electron, emission, from, the, cathode, depends, on, energy, from, photons, rather, than, thermionic, emission, a, vacuum, tube, consists, of, two, or, more, electrodes, in, a, vacuum, inside, an, airtight, envelope, most, tubes, have, glass, envelopes, with, a, glass, to, metal, seal, based, on, kovar, sealable, borosilicate, glasses, although, ceramic, and, metal, envelopes, atop, insulating, bases, have, been, used, the, electrodes, are, attached, to, leads, which, pass, through, the, envelope, via, an, airtight, seal, most, vacuum, tubes, have, a, limited, lifetime, due, to, the, filament, or, heater, burning, out, or, other, failure, modes, so, they, are, made, as, replaceable, units, the, electrode, leads, connect, to, pins, on, the, tube, s, base, which, plug, into, a, tube, socket, tubes, were, a, frequent, cause, of, failure, in, electronic, equipment, and, consumers, were, expected, to, be, able, to, replace, tubes, themselves, in, addition, to, the, base, terminals, some, tubes, had, an, electrode, terminating, at, a, top, cap, the, principal, reason, for, doing, this, was, to, avoid, leakage, resistance, through, the, tube, base, particularly, for, the, high, impedance, grid, input, 580, the, bases, were, commonly, made, with, phenolic, insulation, which, performs, poorly, as, an, insulator, in, humid, conditions, other, reasons, for, using, a, top, cap, include, improving, stability, by, reducing, grid, to, anode, capacitance, improved, high, frequency, performance, keeping, a, very, high, plate, voltage, away, from, lower, voltages, and, accommodating, one, more, electrode, than, allowed, by, the, base, there, was, even, an, occasional, design, that, had, two, top, cap, connections, the, earliest, vacuum, tubes, evolved, from, incandescent, light, bulbs, containing, a, filament, sealed, in, an, evacuated, glass, envelope, when, hot, the, filament, in, a, vacuum, tube, a, cathode, releases, electrons, into, the, vacuum, a, process, called, thermionic, emission, this, can, produce, a, controllable, unidirectional, current, though, the, vacuum, known, as, the, edison, effect, a, second, electrode, the, anode, or, plate, will, attract, those, electrons, if, it, is, at, a, more, positive, voltage, the, result, is, a, net, flow, of, electrons, from, the, filament, to, plate, however, electrons, cannot, flow, in, the, reverse, direction, because, the, plate, is, not, heated, and, does, not, emit, electrons, the, filament, has, a, dual, function, it, emits, electrons, when, heated, and, together, with, the, plate, it, creates, an, electric, field, due, to, the, potential, difference, between, them, such, a, tube, with, only, two, electrodes, is, termed, a, diode, and, is, used, for, rectification, since, current, can, only, pass, in, one, direction, such, a, diode, or, rectifier, will, convert, alternating, current, ac, to, pulsating, dc, diodes, can, therefore, be, used, in, a, dc, power, supply, as, a, demodulator, of, amplitude, modulated, am, radio, signals, and, for, similar, functions, early, tubes, used, the, filament, as, the, cathode, this, is, called, a, directly, heated, tube, most, modern, tubes, are, indirectly, heated, by, a, heater, element, inside, a, metal, tube, that, is, the, cathode, the, heater, is, electrically, isolated, from, the, surrounding, cathode, and, simply, serves, to, heat, the, cathode, sufficiently, for, thermionic, emission, of, electrons, the, electrical, isolation, allows, all, the, tubes, heaters, to, be, supplied, from, a, common, circuit, which, can, be, ac, without, inducing, hum, while, allowing, the, cathodes, in, different, tubes, to, operate, at, different, voltages, h, j, round, invented, the, indirectly, heated, tube, around, 1913, the, filaments, require, constant, and, often, considerable, power, even, when, amplifying, signals, at, the, microwatt, level, power, is, also, dissipated, when, the, electrons, from, the, cathode, slam, into, the, anode, plate, and, heat, it, this, can, occur, even, in, an, idle, amplifier, due, to, the, quiescent, current, necessary, to, ensure, linearity, and, low, distortion, in, a, power, amplifier, this, heating, can, be, considerable, and, can, destroy, the, tube, if, driven, beyond, its, safe, limits, since, the, tube, contains, a, vacuum, the, anodes, in, most, small, and, medium, power, tubes, are, cooled, by, radiation, through, the, glass, envelope, in, some, special, high, power, applications, the, anode, forms, part, of, the, vacuum, envelope, to, conduct, heat, to, an, external, heat, sink, usually, cooled, by, a, blower, or, water, jacket, klystrons, and, magnetrons, often, operate, their, anodes, called, collectors, in, klystrons, at, ground, potential, to, facilitate, cooling, particularly, with, water, without, high, voltage, insulation, these, tubes, instead, operate, with, high, negative, voltages, on, the, filament, and, cathode, except, for, diodes, additional, electrodes, are, positioned, between, the, cathode, and, the, plate, anode, these, electrodes, are, referred, to, as, grids, as, they, are, not, solid, electrodes, but, sparse, elements, through, which, electrons, can, pass, on, their, way, to, the, plate, the, vacuum, tube, is, then, known, as, a, triode, tetrode, pentode, etc, depending, on, the, number, of, grids, a, triode, has, three, electrodes, the, anode, cathode, and, one, grid, and, so, on, the, first, grid, known, as, the, control, grid, and, sometimes, other, grids, transforms, the, diode, into, a, voltage, controlled, device, the, voltage, applied, to, the, control, grid, affects, the, current, between, the, cathode, and, the, plate, when, held, negative, with, respect, to, the, cathode, the, control, grid, creates, an, electric, field, that, repels, electrons, emitted, by, the, cathode, thus, reducing, or, even, stopping, the, current, between, cathode, and, anode, as, long, as, the, control, grid, is, negative, relative, to, the, cathode, essentially, no, current, flows, into, it, yet, a, change, of, several, volts, on, the, control, grid, is, sufficient, to, make, a, large, difference, in, the, plate, current, possibly, changing, the, output, by, hundreds, of, volts, depending, on, the, circuit, the, solid, state, device, which, operates, most, like, the, pentode, tube, is, the, junction, field, effect, transistor, jfet, although, vacuum, tubes, typically, operate, at, over, a, hundred, volts, unlike, most, semiconductors, in, most, applications, the, 19th, century, saw, increasing, research, with, evacuated, tubes, such, as, the, geissler, and, crookes, tubes, the, many, scientists, and, inventors, who, experimented, with, such, tubes, include, thomas, edison, eugen, goldstein, nikola, tesla, and, johann, wilhelm, hittorf, with, the, exception, of, early, light, bulbs, such, tubes, were, only, used, in, scientific, research, or, as, novelties, the, groundwork, laid, by, these, scientists, and, inventors, however, was, critical, to, the, development, of, subsequent, vacuum, tube, technology, although, thermionic, emission, was, originally, reported, in, 1873, by, frederick, guthrie, it, was, thomas, edison, s, apparently, independent, discovery, of, the, phenomenon, in, 1883, referred, to, as, the, edison, effect, that, became, well, known, although, edison, was, aware, of, the, unidirectional, property, of, current, flow, between, the, filament, and, the, anode, his, interest, and, patent, concentrated, on, the, sensitivity, of, the, anode, current, to, the, current, through, the, filament, and, thus, filament, temperature, it, was, years, later, that, john, ambrose, fleming, applied, the, rectifying, property, of, the, edison, effect, to, detection, of, radio, signals, as, an, improvement, over, the, magnetic, detector, amplification, by, vacuum, tube, became, practical, only, with, lee, de, forest, s, 1907, invention, of, the, three, terminal, audion, tube, a, crude, form, of, what, was, to, become, the, triode, being, essentially, the, first, electronic, amplifier, such, tubes, were, instrumental, in, long, distance, telephony, such, as, the, first, coast, to, coast, telephone, line, in, the, us, and, public, address, systems, and, introduced, a, far, superior, and, versatile, technology, for, use, in, radio, transmitters, and, receivers, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, radio, or, wireless, technology, was, in, an, early, stage, of, development, and, the, marconi, company, was, engaged, in, development, and, construction, of, radio, communication, systems, guglielmo, marconi, appointed, english, physicist, john, ambrose, fleming, as, scientific, advisor, in, 1899, fleming, had, been, engaged, as, scientific, advisor, to, edison, telephone, 1879, as, scientific, advisor, at, edison, electric, light, 1882, and, was, also, technical, consultant, to, edison, swan, one, of, marconi, s, needs, was, for, improvement, of, the, detector, a, device, that, extracts, information, from, a, modulated, radio, frequency, marconi, had, developed, a, magnetic, detector, which, was, less, responsive, to, natural, sources, of, radio, frequency, interference, than, the, coherer, but, the, magnetic, detector, only, provided, an, audio, frequency, signal, to, a, telephone, receiver, a, reliable, detector, that, could, drive, a, printing, instrument, was, needed, as, a, result, of, experiments, conducted, on, edison, effect, bulbs, fleming, developed, a, vacuum, tube, that, he, termed, the, oscillation, valve, because, it, passed, current, in, only, one, direction, the, cathode, was, a, carbon, lamp, filament, heated, by, passing, current, through, it, that, produced, thermionic, emission, of, electrons, electrons, that, had, been, emitted, from, the, cathode, were, attracted, to, the, plate, anode, when, the, plate, was, at, a, positive, voltage, with, respect, to, the, cathode, electrons, could, not, pass, in, the, reverse, direction, because, the, plate, was, not, heated, and, not, capable, of, thermionic, emission, of, electrons, fleming, filed, a, patent, for, these, tubes, assigned, to, the, marconi, company, in, the, uk, in, november, 1904, and, this, patent, was, issued, in, september, 1905, later, known, as, the, fleming, valve, the, oscillation, valve, was, developed, for, the, purpose, of, rectifying, radio, frequency, current, as, the, detector, component, of, radio, receiver, circuits, while, offering, no, advantage, over, the, electrical, sensitivity, of, crystal, detectors, the, fleming, valve, offered, advantage, particularly, in, shipboard, use, over, the, difficulty, of, adjustment, of, the, crystal, detector, and, the, susceptibility, of, the, crystal, detector, to, being, dislodged, from, adjustment, by, vibration, or, bumping, in, the, 19th, century, telegraph, and, telephone, engineers, had, recognized, the, need, to, extend, the, distance, that, signals, could, be, transmitted, in, 1906, robert, von, lieben, filed, for, a, patent, for, a, cathode, ray, tube, which, used, an, external, magnetic, deflection, coil, and, was, intended, for, use, as, an, amplifier, in, telephony, equipment, this, von, lieben, magnetic, deflection, tube, was, not, a, successful, amplifier, however, because, of, the, power, used, by, the, deflection, coil, von, lieben, would, later, make, refinements, to, triode, vacuum, tubes, lee, de, forest, is, credited, with, inventing, the, triode, tube, in, 1907, while, experimenting, to, improve, his, original, diode, audion, by, placing, an, additional, electrode, between, the, filament, cathode, and, plate, anode, he, discovered, the, ability, of, the, resulting, device, to, amplify, signals, as, the, voltage, applied, to, the, control, grid, or, simply, grid, was, lowered, from, the, cathode, s, voltage, to, somewhat, more, negative, voltages, the, amount, of, current, from, the, filament, to, the, plate, would, be, reduced, the, negative, electrostatic, field, created, by, the, grid, in, the, vicinity, of, the, cathode, would, inhibit, the, passage, of, emitted, electrons, and, reduce, the, current, to, the, plate, with, the, voltage, of, the, grid, less, than, that, of, the, cathode, no, direct, current, could, pass, from, the, cathode, to, the, grid, thus, a, change, of, voltage, applied, to, the, grid, requiring, very, little, power, input, to, the, grid, could, make, a, change, in, the, plate, current, and, could, lead, to, a, much, larger, voltage, change, at, the, plate, the, result, was, voltage, and, power, amplification, in, 1908, de, forest, was, granted, a, patent, u, s, patent, 879, 532, for, such, a, three, electrode, version, of, his, original, audion, for, use, as, an, electronic, amplifier, in, radio, communications, this, eventually, became, known, as, the, triode, de, forest, s, original, device, was, made, with, conventional, vacuum, technology, the, vacuum, was, not, a, hard, vacuum, but, rather, left, a, very, small, amount, of, residual, gas, the, physics, behind, the, device, s, operation, was, also, not, settled, the, residual, gas, would, cause, a, blue, glow, visible, ionization, when, the, plate, voltage, was, high, above, about, 60, volts, in, 1912, de, forest, and, john, stone, stone, brought, the, audion, for, demonstration, to, at, t, s, engineering, department, dr, harold, d, arnold, of, at, t, recognized, that, the, blue, glow, was, caused, by, ionized, gas, arnold, recommended, that, at, t, purchase, the, patent, and, at, t, followed, his, recommendation, arnold, developed, high, vacuum, tubes, which, were, tested, in, the, summer, of, 1913, on, at, t, s, long, distance, network, the, high, vacuum, tubes, could, operate, at, high, plate, voltages, without, a, blue, glow, finnish, inventor, eric, tigerstedt, significantly, improved, on, the, original, triode, design, in, 1914, while, working, on, his, sound, on, film, process, in, berlin, germany, tigerstedt, s, innovation, was, to, make, the, electrodes, concentric, cylinders, with, the, cathode, at, the, centre, thus, greatly, increasing, the, collection, of, emitted, electrons, at, the, anode, irving, langmuir, at, the, general, electric, research, laboratory, schenectady, new, york, had, improved, wolfgang, gaede, s, high, vacuum, diffusion, pump, and, used, it, to, settle, the, question, of, thermionic, emission, and, conduction, in, a, vacuum, consequently, general, electric, started, producing, hard, vacuum, triodes, which, were, branded, pliotrons, in, 1915, langmuir, patented, the, hard, vacuum, triode, but, de, forest, and, at, t, successfully, asserted, priority, and, invalidated, the, patent, pliotrons, were, closely, followed, by, the, french, type, tm, and, later, the, english, type, r, which, were, in, widespread, use, by, the, allied, military, by, 1916, historically, vacuum, levels, in, production, vacuum, tubes, typically, ranged, from, 10, pa, down, to, 10, npa, 8, 10, 8, torr, down, to, 8, 10, 11, torr, the, triode, and, its, derivatives, tetrodes, and, pentodes, are, transconductance, devices, in, which, the, controlling, signal, applied, to, the, grid, is, a, voltage, and, the, resulting, amplified, signal, appearing, at, the, anode, is, a, current, compare, this, to, the, behavior, of, the, bipolar, junction, transistor, in, which, the, controlling, signal, is, a, current, and, the, output, is, also, a, current, for, vacuum, tubes, transconductance, or, mutual, conductance, g, m, is, defined, as, the, change, in, the, plate, anode, cathode, current, divided, by, the, corresponding, change, in, the, grid, to, cathode, voltage, with, a, constant, plate, anode, to, cathode, voltage, typical, values, of, g, m, for, a, small, signal, vacuum, tube, are, 1, to, 10, millisiemens, it, is, one, of, the, three, constants, of, a, vacuum, tube, the, other, two, being, its, gain, and, plate, resistance, r, p, or, r, a, the, van, der, bijl, equation, defines, their, relationship, as, follows, g, m, r, p, displaystyle, g, m, mu, over, r, p, the, non, linear, operating, characteristic, of, the, triode, caused, early, tube, audio, amplifiers, to, exhibit, harmonic, distortion, at, low, volumes, plotting, plate, current, as, a, function, of, applied, grid, voltage, it, was, seen, that, there, was, a, range, of, grid, voltages, for, which, the, transfer, characteristics, were, approximately, linear, to, use, this, range, a, negative, bias, voltage, had, to, be, applied, to, the, grid, to, position, the, dc, operating, point, in, the, linear, region, this, was, called, the, idle, condition, and, the, plate, current, at, this, point, the, idle, current, the, controlling, voltage, was, superimposed, onto, the, bias, voltage, resulting, in, a, linear, variation, of, plate, current, in, response, to, positive, and, negative, variation, of, the, input, voltage, around, that, point, this, concept, is, called, grid, bias, many, early, radio, sets, had, a, third, battery, called, the, c, battery, unrelated, to, the, present, day, c, cell, for, which, the, letter, denotes, its, size, and, shape, the, c, battery, s, positive, terminal, was, connected, to, the, cathode, of, the, tubes, or, ground, in, most, circuits, and, whose, negative, terminal, supplied, this, bias, voltage, to, the, grids, of, the, tubes, later, circuits, after, tubes, were, made, with, heaters, isolated, from, their, cathodes, used, cathode, biasing, avoiding, the, need, for, a, separate, negative, power, supply, for, cathode, biasing, a, relatively, low, value, resistor, is, connected, between, the, cathode, and, ground, this, makes, the, cathode, positive, with, respect, to, the, grid, which, is, at, ground, potential, for, dc, however, c, batteries, continued, to, be, included, in, some, equipment, even, when, the, a, and, b, batteries, had, been, replaced, by, power, from, the, ac, mains, that, was, possible, because, there, was, essentially, no, current, draw, on, these, batteries, they, could, thus, last, for, many, years, often, longer, than, all, the, tubes, without, requiring, replacement, when, triodes, were, first, used, in, radio, transmitters, and, receivers, it, was, found, that, tuned, amplification, stages, had, a, tendency, to, oscillate, unless, their, gain, was, very, limited, this, was, due, to, the, parasitic, capacitance, between, the, plate, the, amplifier, s, output, and, the, control, grid, the, amplifier, s, input, known, as, the, miller, capacitance, eventually, the, technique, of, neutralization, was, developed, whereby, the, rf, transformer, connected, to, the, plate, anode, would, include, an, additional, winding, in, the, opposite, phase, this, winding, would, be, connected, back, to, the, grid, through, a, small, capacitor, and, when, properly, adjusted, would, cancel, the, miller, capacitance, this, technique, was, employed, and, led, to, the, success, of, the, neutrodyne, radio, during, the, 1920s, however, neutralization, required, careful, adjustment, and, proved, unsatisfactory, when, used, over, a, wide, range, of, frequencies, to, combat, the, stability, problems, of, the, triode, as, a, radio, frequency, amplifier, due, to, grid, to, plate, capacitance, the, physicist, walter, h, schottky, invented, the, tetrode, or, screen, grid, tube, in, 1919, he, showed, that, the, addition, of, an, electrostatic, shield, between, the, control, grid, and, the, plate, could, solve, the, problem, this, design, was, refined, by, hull, and, williams, the, added, grid, became, known, as, the, screen, grid, or, shield, grid, the, screen, grid, is, operated, at, a, positive, voltage, significantly, less, than, the, plate, voltage, and, it, is, bypassed, to, ground, with, a, capacitor, of, low, impedance, at, the, frequencies, to, be, amplified, this, arrangement, substantially, decouples, the, plate, and, the, control, grid, eliminating, the, need, for, neutralizing, circuitry, at, medium, wave, broadcast, frequencies, the, screen, grid, also, largely, reduces, the, influence, of, the, plate, voltage, on, the, space, charge, near, the, cathode, permitting, the, tetrode, to, produce, greater, voltage, gain, than, the, triode, in, amplifier, circuits, while, the, amplification, factors, of, typical, triodes, commonly, range, from, below, ten, to, around, 100, tetrode, amplification, factors, of, 500, are, common, consequently, higher, voltage, gains, from, a, single, tube, amplification, stage, became, possible, reducing, the, number, of, tubes, required, screen, grid, tubes, were, marketed, by, late, 1927, however, the, useful, region, of, operation, of, the, screen, grid, tube, as, an, amplifier, was, limited, to, plate, voltages, greater, than, the, screen, grid, voltage, due, to, secondary, emission, from, the, plate, in, any, tube, electrons, strike, the, plate, with, sufficient, energy, to, cause, the, emission, of, electrons, from, its, surface, in, a, triode, this, secondary, emission, of, electrons, is, not, important, since, they, are, simply, re, captured, by, the, plate, but, in, a, tetrode, they, can, be, captured, by, the, screen, grid, since, it, is, also, at, a, positive, voltage, robbing, them, from, the, plate, current, and, reducing, the, amplification, of, the, tube, since, secondary, electrons, can, outnumber, the, primary, electrons, over, a, certain, range, of, plate, voltages, the, plate, current, can, decrease, with, increasing, plate, voltage, this, is, the, dynatron, region, or, tetrode, kink, and, is, an, example, of, negative, resistance, which, can, itself, cause, instability, another, undesirable, consequence, of, secondary, emission, is, that, screen, current, is, increased, which, may, cause, the, screen, to, exceed, its, power, rating, the, otherwise, undesirable, negative, resistance, region, of, the, plate, characteristic, was, exploited, with, the, dynatron, oscillator, circuit, to, produce, a, simple, oscillator, only, requiring, connection, of, the, plate, to, a, resonant, lc, circuit, to, oscillate, the, dynatron, oscillator, operated, on, the, same, principle, of, negative, resistance, as, the, tunnel, diode, oscillator, many, years, later, the, dynatron, region, of, the, screen, grid, tube, was, eliminated, by, adding, a, grid, between, the, screen, grid, and, the, plate, to, create, the, pentode, the, suppressor, grid, of, the, pentode, was, usually, connected, to, the, cathode, and, its, negative, voltage, relative, to, the, anode, repelled, secondary, electrons, so, that, they, would, be, collected, by, the, anode, instead, of, the, screen, grid, the, term, pentode, means, the, tube, has, five, electrodes, the, pentode, was, invented, in, 1926, by, bernard, d, h, tellegen, and, became, generally, favored, over, the, simple, tetrode, pentodes, are, made, in, two, classes, those, with, the, suppressor, grid, wired, internally, to, the, cathode, e, g, el84, 6bq5, and, those, with, the, suppressor, grid, wired, to, a, separate, pin, for, user, access, e, g, 803, 837, an, alternative, solution, for, power, applications, is, the, beam, tetrode, or, beam, power, tube, discussed, below, superheterodyne, receivers, require, a, local, oscillator, and, mixer, combined, in, the, function, of, a, single, pentagrid, converter, tube, various, alternatives, such, as, using, a, combination, of, a, triode, with, a, hexode, and, even, an, octode, have, been, used, for, this, purpose, the, additional, grids, include, control, grids, at, a, low, potential, and, screen, grids, at, a, high, voltage, many, designs, use, such, a, screen, grid, as, an, additional, anode, to, provide, feedback, for, the, oscillator, function, whose, current, adds, to, that, of, the, incoming, radio, frequency, signal, the, pentagrid, converter, thus, became, widely, used, in, am, receivers, including, the, miniature, tube, version, of, the, all, american, five, octodes, such, as, the, 7a8, were, rarely, used, in, the, united, states, but, much, more, common, in, europe, particularly, in, battery, operated, radios, where, the, lower, power, consumption, was, an, advantage, to, further, reduce, the, cost, and, complexity, of, radio, equipment, two, separate, structures, triode, and, pentode, for, instance, can, be, combined, in, the, bulb, of, a, single, multisection, tube, an, early, example, is, the, loewe, 3nf, this, 1920s, device, has, three, triodes, in, a, single, glass, envelope, together, with, all, the, fixed, capacitors, and, resistors, required, to, make, a, complete, radio, receiver, as, the, loewe, set, had, only, one, tube, socket, it, was, able, to, substantially, undercut, the, competition, since, in, germany, state, tax, was, levied, by, the, number, of, sockets, however, reliability, was, compromised, and, production, costs, for, the, tube, were, much, greater, in, a, sense, these, were, akin, to, integrated, circuits, in, the, united, states, cleartron, briefly, produced, the, multivalve, triple, triode, for, use, in, the, emerson, baby, grand, receiver, this, emerson, set, also, has, a, single, tube, socket, but, because, it, uses, a, four, pin, base, the, additional, element, connections, are, made, on, a, mezzanine, platform, at, the, top, of, the, tube, base, by, 1940, multisection, tubes, had, become, commonplace, there, were, constraints, however, due, to, patents, and, other, licensing, considerations, see, british, valve, association, constraints, due, to, the, number, of, external, pins, leads, often, forced, the, functions, to, share, some, of, those, external, connections, such, as, their, cathode, connections, in, addition, to, the, heater, connection, the, rca, type, 55, is, a, double, diode, triode, used, as, a, detector, automatic, gain, control, rectifier, and, audio, preamplifier, in, early, ac, powered, radios, these, sets, often, include, the, 53, dual, triode, audio, output, another, early, type, of, multi, section, tube, the, 6sn7, is, a, dual, triode, which, performs, the, functions, of, two, triode, tubes, while, taking, up, half, as, much, space, and, costing, less, the, 12ax7, is, a, dual, high, mu, high, voltage, gain, triode, in, a, miniature, enclosure, and, became, widely, used, in, audio, signal, amplifiers, instruments, and, guitar, amplifiers, the, introduction, of, the, miniature, tube, base, see, below, which, can, have, 9, pins, more, than, previously, available, allowed, other, multi, section, tubes, to, be, introduced, such, as, the, 6gh8, ecf82, triode, pentode, quite, popular, in, television, receivers, the, desire, to, include, even, more, functions, in, one, envelope, resulted, in, the, general, electric, compactron, which, has, 12, pins, a, typical, example, the, 6ag11, contains, two, triodes, and, two, diodes, some, otherwise, conventional, tubes, do, not, fall, into, standard, categories, the, 6ar8, 6jh8, and, 6me8, have, several, common, grids, followed, by, a, pair, of, beam, deflection, electrodes, which, deflected, the, current, towards, either, of, two, anodes, they, were, sometimes, known, as, the, sheet, beam, tubes, and, used, in, some, color, tv, sets, for, color, demodulation, the, similar, 7360, was, popular, as, a, balanced, ssb, de, modulator, a, beam, tetrode, or, beam, power, tube, forms, the, electron, stream, from, the, cathode, into, multiple, partially, collimated, beams, to, produce, a, low, potential, space, charge, region, between, the, anode, and, screen, grid, to, return, anode, secondary, emission, electrons, to, the, anode, when, the, anode, potential, is, less, than, that, of, the, screen, grid, formation, of, beams, also, reduces, screen, grid, current, in, some, cylindrically, symmetrical, beam, power, tubes, the, cathode, is, formed, of, narrow, strips, of, emitting, material, that, are, aligned, with, the, apertures, of, the, control, grid, reducing, control, grid, current, this, design, helps, to, overcome, some, of, the, practical, barriers, to, designing, high, power, high, efficiency, power, tubes, manufacturer, s, data, sheets, often, use, the, terms, beam, pentode, or, beam, power, pentode, instead, of, beam, power, tube, and, use, a, pentode, graphic, symbol, instead, of, a, graphic, symbol, showing, beam, forming, plates, beam, power, tubes, offer, the, advantages, of, a, longer, load, line, less, screen, current, higher, transconductance, and, lower, third, harmonic, distortion, than, comparable, power, pentodes, beam, power, tubes, can, be, connected, as, triodes, for, improved, audio, tonal, quality, but, in, triode, mode, deliver, significantly, reduced, power, output, gas, filled, tubes, such, as, discharge, tubes, and, cold, cathode, tubes, are, not, hard, vacuum, tubes, though, are, always, filled, with, gas, at, less, than, sea, level, atmospheric, pressure, types, such, as, the, voltage, regulator, tube, and, thyratron, resemble, hard, vacuum, tubes, and, fit, in, sockets, designed, for, vacuum, tubes, their, distinctive, orange, red, or, purple, glow, during, operation, indicates, the, presence, of, gas, electrons, flowing, in, a, vacuum, do, not, produce, light, within, that, region, these, types, may, still, be, referred, to, as, electron, tubes, as, they, do, perform, electronic, functions, high, power, rectifiers, use, mercury, vapor, to, achieve, a, lower, forward, voltage, drop, than, high, vacuum, tubes, early, tubes, used, a, metal, or, glass, envelope, atop, an, insulating, bakelite, base, in, 1938, a, technique, was, developed, to, use, an, all, glass, construction, with, the, pins, fused, in, the, glass, base, of, the, envelope, this, allowed, the, design, of, a, much, smaller, tube, profile, known, as, the, miniature, tube, having, seven, or, nine, pins, making, tubes, smaller, reduced, the, voltage, where, they, could, safely, operate, and, also, reduced, the, power, dissipation, of, the, filament, miniature, tubes, became, predominant, in, consumer, applications, such, as, radio, receivers, and, hi, fi, amplifiers, however, the, larger, older, styles, continued, to, be, used, especially, as, higher, power, rectifiers, in, higher, power, audio, output, stages, and, as, transmitting, tubes, sub, miniature, tubes, with, a, size, roughly, that, of, half, a, cigarette, were, used, in, consumer, applications, as, hearing, aid, amplifiers, these, tubes, did, not, have, pins, plugging, into, a, socket, but, were, soldered, in, place, the, acorn, tube, named, due, to, its, shape, was, also, very, small, as, was, the, metal, cased, rca, nuvistor, from, 1959, about, the, size, of, a, thimble, the, nuvistor, was, developed, to, compete, with, the, early, transistors, and, operated, at, higher, frequencies, than, those, early, transistors, could, the, small, size, supported, especially, high, frequency, operation, nuvistors, were, used, in, aircraft, radio, transceivers, uhf, television, tuners, and, some, hifi, fm, radio, tuners, sansui, 500a, until, replaced, by, high, frequency, capable, transistors, the, earliest, vacuum, tubes, strongly, resembled, incandescent, light, bulbs, and, were, made, by, lamp, manufacturers, who, had, the, equipment, needed, to, manufacture, glass, envelopes, and, the, vacuum, pumps, required, to, evacuate, the, enclosures, de, forest, used, heinrich, geissler, s, mercury, displacement, pump, which, left, behind, a, partial, vacuum, the, development, of, the, diffusion, pump, in, 1915, and, improvement, by, irving, langmuir, led, to, the, development, of, high, vacuum, tubes, after, world, war, i, specialized, manufacturers, using, more, economical, construction, methods, were, set, up, to, fill, the, growing, demand, for, broadcast, receivers, bare, tungsten, filaments, operated, at, a, temperature, of, around, 2200, c, the, development, of, oxide, coated, filaments, in, the, mid, 1920s, reduced, filament, operating, temperature, to, a, dull, red, heat, around, 700, c, which, in, turn, reduced, thermal, distortion, of, the, tube, structure, and, allowed, closer, spacing, of, tube, elements, this, in, turn, improved, tube, gain, since, the, gain, of, a, triode, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, spacing, between, grid, and, cathode, bare, tungsten, filaments, remain, in, use, in, small, transmitting, tubes, but, are, brittle, and, tend, to, fracture, if, handled, roughly, e, g, in, the, postal, services, these, tubes, are, best, suited, to, stationary, equipment, where, impact, and, vibration, is, not, present, the, desire, to, power, electronic, equipment, using, ac, mains, power, faced, a, difficulty, with, respect, to, the, powering, of, the, tubes, filaments, as, these, were, also, the, cathode, of, each, tube, powering, the, filaments, directly, from, a, power, transformer, introduced, mains, frequency, 50, or, 60, hz, hum, into, audio, stages, the, invention, of, the, equipotential, cathode, reduced, this, problem, with, the, filaments, being, powered, by, a, balanced, ac, power, transformer, winding, having, a, grounded, center, tap, a, superior, solution, and, one, which, allowed, each, cathode, to, float, at, a, different, voltage, was, that, of, the, indirectly, heated, cathode, a, cylinder, of, oxide, coated, nickel, acted, as, an, electron, emitting, cathode, and, was, electrically, isolated, from, the, filament, inside, it, indirectly, heated, cathodes, enable, the, cathode, circuit, to, be, separated, from, the, heater, circuit, the, filament, no, longer, electrically, connected, to, the, tube, s, electrodes, became, simply, known, as, a, heater, and, could, as, well, be, powered, by, ac, without, any, introduction, of, hum, in, the, 1930s, indirectly, heated, cathode, tubes, became, widespread, in, equipment, using, ac, power, directly, heated, cathode, tubes, continued, to, be, widely, used, in, battery, powered, equipment, as, their, filaments, required, considerably, less, power, than, the, heaters, required, with, indirectly, heated, cathodes, tubes, designed, for, high, gain, audio, applications, may, have, twisted, heater, wires, to, cancel, out, stray, electric, fields, fields, that, could, induce, objectionable, hum, into, the, program, material, heaters, may, be, energized, with, either, alternating, current, ac, or, direct, current, dc, dc, is, often, used, where, low, hum, is, required, vacuum, tubes, used, as, switches, made, electronic, computing, possible, for, the, first, time, but, the, cost, and, relatively, short, mean, time, to, failure, of, tubes, were, limiting, factors, the, common, wisdom, was, that, valves, which, like, light, bulbs, contained, a, hot, glowing, filament, could, never, be, used, satisfactorily, in, large, numbers, for, they, were, unreliable, and, in, a, large, installation, too, many, would, fail, in, too, short, a, time, tommy, flowers, who, later, designed, colossus, discovered, that, so, long, as, valves, were, switched, on, and, left, on, they, could, operate, reliably, for, very, long, periods, especially, if, their, heaters, were, run, on, a, reduced, current, in, 1934, flowers, built, a, successful, experimental, installation, using, over, 3, 000, tubes, in, small, independent, modules, when, a, tube, failed, it, was, possible, to, switch, off, one, module, and, keep, the, others, going, thereby, reducing, the, risk, of, another, tube, failure, being, caused, this, installation, was, accepted, by, the, post, office, who, operated, telephone, exchanges, flowers, was, also, a, pioneer, of, using, tubes, as, very, fast, compared, to, electromechanical, devices, electronic, switches, later, work, confirmed, that, tube, unreliability, was, not, as, serious, an, issue, as, generally, believed, the, 1946, eniac, with, over, 17, 000, tubes, had, a, tube, failure, which, took, 15, minutes, to, locate, on, average, every, two, days, the, quality, of, the, tubes, was, a, factor, and, the, diversion, of, skilled, people, during, the, second, world, war, lowered, the, general, quality, of, tubes, during, the, war, colossus, was, instrumental, in, breaking, german, codes, after, the, war, development, continued, with, tube, based, computers, including, military, computers, eniac, and, whirlwind, the, ferranti, mark, 1, one, of, the, first, commercially, available, electronic, computers, and, univac, i, also, available, commercially, advances, using, subminiature, tubes, included, the, jaincomp, series, of, machines, produced, by, the, jacobs, instrument, company, of, bethesda, maryland, models, such, as, its, jaincomp, b, employed, just, 300, such, tubes, in, a, desktop, sized, unit, that, offered, performance, to, rival, many, of, the, then, room, sized, machines, colossus, i, and, its, successor, colossus, ii, mk2, were, designed, by, tommy, flowers, and, built, by, the, general, post, office, for, bletchley, park, bp, during, world, war, ii, to, substantially, speed, up, the, task, of, breaking, the, german, high, level, lorenz, encryption, colossus, replaced, an, earlier, machine, based, on, relay, and, switch, logic, the, heath, robinson, colossus, was, able, to, break, in, a, matter, of, hours, messages, that, had, previously, taken, several, weeks, it, was, also, much, more, reliable, colossus, was, the, first, use, of, vacuum, tubes, working, in, concert, on, such, a, large, scale, for, a, single, machine, tommy, flowers, who, conceived, colossus, wrote, that, most, radio, equipment, was, carted, round, dumped, around, switched, on, and, off, and, generally, mishandled, but, i, d, introduced, valves, into, telephone, equipment, in, large, numbers, before, the, war, and, i, knew, that, if, you, never, moved, them, and, never, switched, them, on, and, off, they, would, go, on, forever, colossus, was, that, reliable, extremely, reliable, on, its, first, day, at, bp, a, problem, with, a, known, answer, was, set, to, the, amazement, of, bp, station, x, after, running, for, four, hours, with, each, run, taking, half, an, hour, the, answer, was, the, same, every, time, the, robinson, did, not, always, give, the, same, answer, colossus, i, used, about, 1600, valves, and, colossus, ii, about, 2400, valves, some, sources, say, 1500, mk, i, and, 2500, mk, ii, the, robinson, used, about, a, hundred, valves, some, sources, say, fewer, to, meet, the, reliability, requirements, of, the, 1951, us, digital, computer, whirlwind, special, quality, tubes, with, extended, life, and, a, long, lasting, cathode, in, particular, were, produced, the, problem, of, short, lifetime, was, traced, largely, to, evaporation, of, silicon, used, in, the, tungsten, alloy, to, make, the, heater, wire, easier, to, draw, the, silicon, forms, barium, orthosilicate, at, the, interface, between, the, nickel, sleeve, and, the, cathode, barium, oxide, coating, 301, this, cathode, interface, is, a, high, resistance, layer, with, some, parallel, capacitance, which, greatly, reduces, the, cathode, current, when, the, tube, is, switched, into, conduction, mode, 224, elimination, of, silicon, from, the, heater, wire, alloy, and, more, frequent, replacement, of, the, wire, drawing, dies, allowed, the, production, of, tubes, that, were, reliable, enough, for, the, whirlwind, project, high, purity, nickel, tubing, and, cathode, coatings, free, of, materials, such, as, silicates, and, aluminum, that, can, reduce, emissivity, also, contribute, to, long, cathode, life, the, first, such, computer, tube, was, sylvania, s, 7ak7, pentode, of, 1948, these, replaced, the, 7ad7, which, was, supposed, to, be, better, quality, than, the, standard, 6ag7, but, proved, too, unreliable, 59, computers, were, the, first, tube, devices, to, run, tubes, at, cutoff, enough, negative, grid, voltage, to, make, them, cease, conduction, for, quite, extended, periods, of, time, running, in, cutoff, with, the, heater, on, accelerates, cathode, poisoning, and, the, output, current, of, the, tube, will, be, greatly, reduced, when, switched, into, conduction, mode, 224, the, 7ak7, tubes, improved, the, cathode, poisoning, problem, but, that, alone, was, insufficient, to, achieve, the, required, reliability, 60, further, measures, included, switching, off, the, heater, voltage, when, the, tubes, were, not, required, to, conduct, for, extended, periods, turning, on, and, off, the, heater, voltage, with, a, slow, ramp, to, avoid, thermal, shock, on, the, heater, element, 226, and, stress, testing, the, tubes, during, offline, maintenance, periods, to, bring, on, early, failure, of, weak, units, 60, 61, another, commonly, used, computer, tube, was, the, 5965, also, labeled, as, e180cc, this, according, to, a, memorandom, from, mit, for, project, whirwind, was, developed, for, ibm, by, general, electric, primarily, for, use, in, the, ibm, 701, calculators, and, was, designated, as, a, general, purpose, triode, tube, the, tubes, developed, for, whirlwind, were, later, used, in, the, giant, sage, air, defense, computer, system, by, the, late, 1950s, it, was, routine, for, special, quality, small, signal, tubes, to, last, for, hundreds, of, thousands, of, hours, if, operated, conservatively, this, increased, reliability, also, made, mid, cable, amplifiers, in, submarine, cables, possible, a, considerable, amount, of, heat, is, produced, when, tubes, operate, from, both, the, filament, heater, and, the, stream, of, electrons, bombarding, the, plate, in, power, amplifiers, this, source, of, heat, is, greater, than, cathode, heating, a, few, types, of, tube, permit, operation, with, the, anodes, at, a, dull, red, heat, in, other, types, red, heat, indicates, severe, overload, the, requirements, for, heat, removal, can, significantly, change, the, appearance, of, high, power, vacuum, tubes, high, power, audio, amplifiers, and, rectifiers, required, larger, envelopes, to, dissipate, heat, transmitting, tubes, could, be, much, larger, still, heat, escapes, the, device, by, black, body, radiation, from, the, anode, plate, as, infrared, radiation, and, by, convection, of, air, over, the, tube, envelope, 10, convection, is, not, possible, inside, most, tubes, since, the, anode, is, surrounded, by, vacuum, tubes, which, generate, relatively, little, heat, such, as, the, 1, 4, volt, filament, directly, heated, tubes, designed, for, use, in, battery, powered, equipment, often, have, shiny, metal, anodes, 1t4, 1r5, and, 1a7, are, examples, gas, filled, tubes, such, as, thyratrons, may, also, use, a, shiny, metal, anode, since, the, gas, present, inside, the, tube, allows, for, heat, convection, from, the, anode, to, the, glass, enclosure, the, anode, is, often, treated, to, make, its, surface, emit, more, infrared, energy, high, power, amplifier, tubes, are, designed, with, external, anodes, that, can, be, cooled, by, convection, forced, air, or, circulating, water, the, water, cooled, 80, kg, 1, 25, mw, 8974, is, among, the, largest, commercial, tubes, available, today, in, a, water, cooled, tube, the, anode, voltage, appears, directly, on, the, cooling, water, surface, thus, requiring, the, water, to, be, an, electrical, insulator, to, prevent, high, voltage, leakage, through, the, cooling, water, to, the, radiator, system, water, as, usually, supplied, has, ions, that, conduct, electricity, deionized, water, a, good, insulator, is, required, such, systems, usually, have, a, built, in, water, conductance, monitor, which, will, shut, down, the, high, tension, supply, if, the, conductance, becomes, too, high, the, screen, grid, may, also, generate, considerable, heat, limits, to, screen, grid, dissipation, in, addition, to, plate, dissipation, are, listed, for, power, devices, if, these, are, exceeded, then, tube, failure, is, likely, most, modern, tubes, have, glass, envelopes, but, metal, fused, quartz, silica, and, ceramic, have, also, been, used, a, first, version, of, the, 6l6, used, a, metal, envelope, sealed, with, glass, beads, while, a, glass, disk, fused, to, the, metal, was, used, in, later, versions, metal, and, ceramic, are, used, almost, exclusively, for, power, tubes, above, 2, kw, dissipation, the, nuvistor, was, a, modern, receiving, tube, using, a, very, small, metal, and, ceramic, package, the, internal, elements, of, tubes, have, always, been, connected, to, external, circuitry, via, pins, at, their, base, which, plug, into, a, socket, subminiature, tubes, were, produced, using, wire, leads, rather, than, sockets, however, these, were, restricted, to, rather, specialized, applications, in, addition, to, the, connections, at, the, base, of, the, tube, many, early, triodes, connected, the, grid, using, a, metal, cap, at, the, top, of, the, tube, this, reduces, stray, capacitance, between, the, grid, and, the, plate, leads, tube, caps, were, also, used, for, the, plate, anode, connection, particularly, in, transmitting, tubes, and, tubes, using, a, very, high, plate, voltage, high, power, tubes, such, as, transmitting, tubes, have, packages, designed, more, to, enhance, heat, transfer, in, some, tubes, the, metal, envelope, is, also, the, anode, the, 4cx1000a, is, an, external, anode, tube, of, this, sort, air, is, blown, through, an, array, of, fins, attached, to, the, anode, thus, cooling, it, power, tubes, using, this, cooling, scheme, are, available, up, to, 150, kw, dissipation, above, that, level, water, or, water, vapor, cooling, are, used, the, highest, power, tube, currently, available, is, the, eimac, 4cm2500kg, a, forced, water, cooled, power, tetrode, capable, of, dissipating, 2, 5, megawatts, by, comparison, the, largest, power, transistor, can, only, dissipate, about, 1, kilowatt, the, generic, name, valve, used, in, the, uk, derives, from, the, unidirectional, current, flow, allowed, by, the, earliest, device, the, thermionic, diode, emitting, electrons, from, a, heated, filament, by, analogy, with, a, non, return, valve, in, a, water, pipe, the, us, names, vacuum, tube, electron, tube, and, thermionic, tube, all, simply, describe, a, tubular, envelope, which, has, been, evacuated, vacuum, has, a, heater, and, controls, electron, flow, in, many, cases, manufacturers, and, the, military, gave, tubes, designations, that, said, nothing, about, their, purpose, e, g, 1614, in, the, early, days, some, manufacturers, used, proprietary, names, which, might, convey, some, information, but, only, about, their, products, the, kt66, and, kt88, were, kinkless, tetrodes, later, consumer, tubes, were, given, names, that, conveyed, some, information, with, the, same, name, often, used, generically, by, several, manufacturers, in, the, us, radio, electronics, television, manufacturers, association, retma, designations, comprise, a, number, followed, by, one, or, two, letters, and, a, number, the, first, number, is, the, rounded, heater, voltage, the, letters, designate, a, particular, tube, but, say, nothing, about, its, structure, and, the, final, number, is, the, total, number, of, electrodes, without, distinguishing, between, say, a, tube, with, many, electrodes, or, two, sets, of, electrodes, in, a, single, envelope, a, double, triode, for, example, for, example, the, 12ax7, is, a, double, triode, two, sets, of, three, electrodes, plus, heater, with, a, 12, 6v, heater, which, as, it, happens, can, also, be, connected, to, run, from, 6, 3v, the, ax, designates, this, tube, s, characteristics, similar, but, not, identical, tubes, are, the, 12ad7, 12ae7, 12at7, 12au7, 12av7, 12aw7, rare, 12ay7, and, the, 12az7, a, system, widely, used, in, europe, known, as, the, mullard, philips, tube, designation, also, extended, to, transistors, uses, a, letter, followed, by, one, or, more, further, letters, and, a, number, the, type, designator, specifies, the,

for, example, the, ecc83, equivalent, to, the, 12ax7, is, a, 6, 3v, e, double, triode, cc, with, a, miniature, base, 8, in, this, system, special, quality, tubes, e, g, for, long, life, computer, use, are, indicated, by, moving, the, number, immediately, after, the, first, letter, the, e83cc, is, a, special, quality, equivalent, of, the, ecc83, the, e55l, a, power, pentode, with, no, consumer, equivalent, some, special, purpose, tubes, are, constructed, with, particular, gases, in, the, envelope, for, instance, voltage, regulator, tubes, contain, various, inert, gases, such, as, argon, helium, or, neon, which, will, ionize, at, predictable, voltages, the, thyratron, is, a, special, purpose, tube, filled, with, low, pressure, gas, or, mercury, vapor, like, vacuum, tubes, it, contains, a, hot, cathode, and, an, anode, but, also, a, control, electrode, which, behaves, somewhat, like, the, grid, of, a, triode, when, the, control, electrode, starts, conduction, the, gas, ionizes, after, which, the, control, electrode, can, no, longer, stop, the, current, the, tube, latches, into, conduction, removing, anode, plate, voltage, lets, the, gas, de, ionize, restoring, its, non, conductive, state, some, thyratrons, can, carry, large, currents, for, their, physical, size, one, example, is, the, miniature, type, 2d21, often, seen, in, 1950s, jukeboxes, as, control, switches, for, relays, a, cold, cathode, version, of, the, thyratron, which, uses, a, pool, of, mercury, for, its, cathode, is, called, an, ignitron, some, can, switch, thousands, of, amperes, thyratrons, containing, hydrogen, have, a, very, consistent, time, delay, between, their, turn, on, pulse, and, full, conduction, they, behave, much, like, modern, silicon, controlled, rectifiers, also, called, thyristors, due, to, their, functional, similarity, to, thyratrons, hydrogen, thyratrons, have, long, been, used, in, radar, transmitters, a, specialized, tube, is, the, krytron, which, is, used, for, rapid, high, voltage, switching, krytrons, are, used, to, initiate, the, detonations, used, to, set, off, a, nuclear, weapon, krytrons, are, heavily, controlled, at, an, international, level, x, ray, tubes, are, used, in, medical, imaging, among, other, uses, x, ray, tubes, used, for, continuous, duty, operation, in, fluoroscopy, and, ct, imaging, equipment, may, use, a, focused, cathode, and, a, rotating, anode, to, dissipate, the, large, amounts, of, heat, thereby, generated, these, are, housed, in, an, oil, filled, aluminum, housing, to, provide, cooling, the, photomultiplier, tube, is, an, extremely, sensitive, detector, of, light, which, uses, the, photoelectric, effect, and, secondary, emission, rather, than, thermionic, emission, to, generate, and, amplify, electrical, signals, nuclear, medicine, imaging, equipment, and, liquid, scintillation, counters, use, photomultiplier, tube, arrays, to, detect, low, intensity, scintillation, due, to, ionizing, radiation, the, ignatron, tube, was, used, in, resistance, welding, equipment, in, the, early, 1970s, the, ignatron, had, a, cathode, anode, and, an, igniter, the, tube, base, was, filled, with, mercury, and, the, tube, was, used, as, a, very, high, current, switch, a, large, current, potential, was, placed, between, the, anode, and, cathode, of, the, tube, but, was, only, permitted, to, conduct, when, the, igniter, in, contact, with, the, mercury, had, enough, current, to, vaporize, the, mercury, and, complete, the, circuit, because, this, was, used, in, resistance, welding, there, were, two, ignatrons, for, the, two, phases, of, an, ac, circuit, because, of, the, mercury, at, the, bottom, of, the, tube, they, were, extremely, difficult, to, ship, these, tubes, were, eventually, replaced, by, scrs, silicon, controlled, rectifiers, batteries, provided, the, voltages, required, by, tubes, in, early, radio, sets, three, different, voltages, were, generally, required, using, three, different, batteries, designated, as, the, a, b, and, c, battery, the, a, battery, or, lt, low, tension, battery, provided, the, filament, voltage, tube, heaters, were, designed, for, single, double, or, triple, cell, lead, acid, batteries, giving, nominal, heater, voltages, of, 2, v, 4, v, or, 6, v, in, portable, radios, dry, batteries, were, sometimes, used, with, 1, 5, or, 1, v, heaters, reducing, filament, consumption, improved, the, life, span, of, batteries, by, 1955, towards, the, end, of, the, tube, era, tubes, using, only, 50, ma, down, to, as, little, as, 10, ma, for, the, heaters, had, been, developed, the, high, voltage, applied, to, the, anode, plate, was, provided, by, the, b, battery, or, the, ht, high, tension, supply, or, battery, these, were, generally, of, dry, cell, construction, and, typically, came, in, 22, 5, 45, 67, 5, 90, 120, or, 135, volt, versions, after, the, use, of, b, batteries, was, phased, out, and, rectified, line, power, was, employed, to, produce, the, high, voltage, needed, by, tubes, plates, the, term, b, persisted, in, the, us, when, referring, to, the, high, voltage, source, most, of, the, rest, of, the, english, speaking, world, refers, to, this, supply, as, just, ht, high, tension, early, sets, used, a, grid, bias, battery, or, c, battery, which, was, connected, to, provide, a, negative, voltage, since, no, current, flows, through, a, tube, s, grid, connection, these, batteries, had, no, current, drain, and, lasted, the, longest, usually, limited, by, their, own, shelf, life, the, supply, from, the, grid, bias, battery, was, rarely, if, ever, disconnected, when, the, radio, was, otherwise, switched, off, even, after, ac, power, supplies, became, commonplace, some, radio, sets, continued, to, be, built, with, c, batteries, as, they, would, almost, never, need, replacing, however, more, modern, circuits, were, designed, using, cathode, biasing, eliminating, the, need, for, a, third, power, supply, voltage, this, became, practical, with, tubes, using, indirect, heating, of, the, cathode, along, with, the, development, of, resistor, capacitor, coupling, which, replaced, earlier, interstage, transformers, the, c, battery, for, bias, is, a, designation, having, no, relation, to, the, c, cell, battery, size, battery, replacement, was, a, major, operating, cost, for, early, radio, receiver, users, the, development, of, the, battery, eliminator, and, in, 1925, batteryless, receivers, operated, by, household, power, reduced, operating, costs, and, contributed, to, the, growing, popularity, of, radio, a, power, supply, using, a, transformer, with, several, windings, one, or, more, rectifiers, which, may, themselves, be, vacuum, tubes, and, large, filter, capacitors, provided, the, required, direct, current, voltages, from, the, alternating, current, source, as, a, cost, reduction, measure, especially, in, high, volume, consumer, receivers, all, the, tube, heaters, could, be, connected, in, series, across, the, ac, supply, using, heaters, requiring, the, same, current, and, with, a, similar, warm, up, time, in, one, such, design, a, tap, on, the, tube, heater, string, supplied, the, 6, volts, needed, for, the, dial, light, by, deriving, the, high, voltage, from, a, half, wave, rectifier, directly, connected, to, the, ac, mains, the, heavy, and, costly, power, transformer, was, eliminated, this, also, allowed, such, receivers, to, operate, on, direct, current, a, so, called, ac, dc, receiver, design, many, different, us, consumer, am, radio, manufacturers, of, the, era, used, a, virtually, identical, circuit, given, the, nickname, all, american, five, where, the, mains, voltage, was, in, the, 100, 120, v, range, this, limited, voltage, proved, suitable, only, for, low, power, receivers, television, receivers, either, required, a, transformer, or, could, use, a, voltage, doubling, circuit, where, 230, v, nominal, mains, voltage, was, used, television, receivers, as, well, could, dispense, with, a, power, transformer, transformer, less, power, supplies, required, safety, precautions, in, their, design, to, limit, the, shock, hazard, to, users, such, as, electrically, insulated, cabinets, and, an, interlock, tying, the, power, cord, to, the, cabinet, back, so, the, line, cord, was, necessarily, disconnected, if, the, user, or, service, person, opened, the, cabinet, a, cheater, cord, was, a, power, cord, ending, in, the, special, socket, used, by, the, safety, interlock, servicers, could, then, power, the, device, with, the, hazardous, voltages, exposed, to, avoid, the, warm, up, delay, instant, on, television, receivers, passed, a, small, heating, current, through, their, tubes, even, when, the, set, was, nominally, off, at, switch, on, full, heating, current, was, provided, and, the, set, would, play, almost, immediately, one, reliability, problem, of, tubes, with, oxide, cathodes, is, the, possibility, that, the, cathode, may, slowly, become, poisoned, by, gas, molecules, from, other, elements, in, the, tube, which, reduce, its, ability, to, emit, electrons, trapped, gases, or, slow, gas, leaks, can, also, damage, the, cathode, or, cause, plate, anode, current, runaway, due, to, ionization, of, free, gas, molecules, vacuum, hardness, and, proper, selection, of, construction, materials, are, the, major, influences, on, tube, lifetime, depending, on, the, material, temperature, and, construction, the, surface, material, of, the, cathode, may, also, diffuse, onto, other, elements, the, resistive, heaters, that, heat, the, cathodes, may, break, in, a, manner, similar, to, incandescent, lamp, filaments, but, rarely, do, since, they, operate, at, much, lower, temperatures, than, lamps, the, heater, s, failure, mode, is, typically, a, stress, related, fracture, of, the, tungsten, wire, or, at, a, weld, point, and, generally, occurs, after, accruing, many, thermal, power, on, off, cycles, tungsten, wire, has, a, very, low, resistance, when, at, room, temperature, a, negative, temperature, coefficient, device, such, as, a, thermistor, may, be, incorporated, in, the, equipment, s, heater, supply, or, a, ramp, up, circuit, may, be, employed, to, allow, the, heater, or, filaments, to, reach, operating, temperature, more, gradually, than, if, powered, up, in, a, step, function, low, cost, radios, had, tubes, with, heaters, connected, in, series, with, a, total, voltage, equal, to, that, of, the, line, mains, some, receivers, made, before, world, war, ii, had, series, string, heaters, with, total, voltage, less, than, that, of, the, mains, some, had, a, resistance, wire, running, the, length, of, the, power, cord, to, drop, the, voltage, to, the, tubes, others, had, series, resistors, made, like, regular, tubes, they, were, called, ballast, tubes, following, world, war, ii, tubes, intended, to, be, used, in, series, heater, strings, were, redesigned, to, all, have, the, same, controlled, warm, up, time, earlier, designs, had, quite, different, thermal, time, constants, the, audio, output, stage, for, instance, had, a, larger, cathode, and, warmed, up, more, slowly, than, lower, powered, tubes, the, result, was, that, heaters, that, warmed, up, faster, also, temporarily, had, higher, resistance, because, of, their, positive, temperature, coefficient, this, disproportionate, resistance, caused, them, to, temporarily, operate, with, heater, voltages, well, above, their, ratings, and, shortened, their, life, another, important, reliability, problem, is, caused, by, air, leakage, into, the, tube, usually, oxygen, in, the, air, reacts, chemically, with, the, hot, filament, or, cathode, quickly, ruining, it, designers, developed, tube, designs, that, sealed, reliably, this, was, why, most, tubes, were, constructed, of, glass, metal, alloys, such, as, cunife, and, fernico, and, glasses, had, been, developed, for, light, bulbs, that, expanded, and, contracted, in, similar, amounts, as, temperature, changed, these, made, it, easy, to, construct, an, insulating, envelope, of, glass, while, passing, connection, wires, through, the, glass, to, the, electrodes, when, a, vacuum, tube, is, overloaded, or, operated, past, its, design, dissipation, its, anode, plate, may, glow, red, in, consumer, equipment, a, glowing, plate, is, universally, a, sign, of, an, overloaded, tube, however, some, large, transmitting, tubes, are, designed, to, operate, with, their, anodes, at, red, orange, or, in, rare, cases, white, heat, special, quality, versions, of, standard, tubes, were, often, made, designed, for, improved, performance, in, some, respect, such, as, a, longer, life, cathode, low, noise, construction, mechanical, ruggedness, via, ruggedized, filaments, low, microphony, for, applications, where, the, tube, will, spend, much, of, its, time, cut, off, etc, the, only, way, to, know, the, particular, features, of, a, special, quality, part, is, by, reading, the, datasheet, names, may, reflect, the, standard, name, 12au7, 12au7a, its, equivalent, ecc82, e82cc, etc, or, be, absolutely, anything, standard, and, special, quality, equivalents, of, the, same, tube, include, 12au7, ecc82, b329, cv491, e2163, e812cc, m8136, cv4003, 6067, vx7058, 5814a, and, 12au7a, the, longest, recorded, valve, life, was, earned, by, a, mazda, ac, p, pentode, valve, serial, no, 4418, in, operation, at, the, bbc, s, main, northern, ireland, transmitter, at, lisnagarvey, the, valve, was, in, service, from, 1935, until, 1961, and, had, a, recorded, life, of, 232, 592, hours, the, bbc, maintained, meticulous, records, of, their, valves, lives, with, periodic, returns, to, their, central, valve, stores, a, vacuum, tube, needs, an, extremely, high, vacuum, or, hard, vacuum, from, x, ray, terminology, to, avoid, the, consequences, of, generating, positive, ions, within, the, tube, residual, gas, atoms, ionize, when, struck, by, an, electron, and, can, adversely, affect, the, cathode, reducing, emission, larger, amounts, of, residual, gas, can, create, a, visible, glow, discharge, between, the, tube, electrodes, and, cause, overheating, of, the, electrodes, producing, more, gas, damaging, the, tube, and, possibly, other, components, due, to, excess, current, to, avoid, these, effects, the, residual, pressure, within, the, tube, must, be, low, enough, that, the, mean, free, path, of, an, electron, is, much, longer, than, the, size, of, the, tube, so, an, electron, is, unlikely, to, strike, a, residual, atom, and, very, few, ionized, atoms, will, be, present, commercial, vacuum, tubes, are, evacuated, at, manufacture, to, about, 0, 000001, mmhg, 1, 0, 10, 6, torr, 130, pa, 1, 3, 10, 6, mbar, 1, 3, 10, 9, atm, to, prevent, gases, from, compromising, the, tube, s, vacuum, modern, tubes, are, constructed, with, getters, which, are, usually, metals, that, oxidize, quickly, barium, being, the, most, common, for, glass, tubes, while, the, tube, envelope, is, being, evacuated, the, internal, parts, except, the, getter, are, heated, by, rf, induction, heating, to, evolve, any, remaining, gas, from, the, metal, parts, the, tube, is, then, sealed, and, the, getter, trough, or, pan, for, flash, getters, is, heated, to, a, high, temperature, again, by, radio, frequency, induction, heating, which, causes, the, getter, material, to, vaporize, and, react, with, any, residual, gas, the, vapor, is, deposited, on, the, inside, of, the, glass, envelope, leaving, a, silver, colored, metallic, patch, that, continues, to, absorb, small, amounts, of, gas, that, may, leak, into, the, tube, during, its, working, life, great, care, is, taken, with, the, valve, design, to, ensure, this, material, is, not, deposited, on, any, of, the, working, electrodes, if, a, tube, develops, a, serious, leak, in, the, envelope, this, deposit, turns, a, white, color, as, it, reacts, with, atmospheric, oxygen, large, transmitting, and, specialized, tubes, often, use, more, exotic, getter, materials, such, as, zirconium, early, gettered, tubes, used, phosphorus, based, getters, and, these, tubes, are, easily, identifiable, as, the, phosphorus, leaves, a, characteristic, orange, or, rainbow, deposit, on, the, glass, the, use, of, phosphorus, was, short, lived, and, was, quickly, replaced, by, the, superior, barium, getters, unlike, the, barium, getters, the, phosphorus, did, not, absorb, any, further, gases, once, it, had, fired, getters, act, by, chemically, combining, with, residual, or, infiltrating, gases, but, are, unable, to, counteract, non, reactive, inert, gases, a, known, problem, mostly, affecting, valves, with, large, envelopes, such, as, cathode, ray, tubes, and, camera, tubes, such, as, iconoscopes, orthicons, and, image, orthicons, comes, from, helium, infiltration, the, effect, appears, as, impaired, or, absent, functioning, and, as, a, diffuse, glow, along, the, electron, stream, inside, the, tube, this, effect, cannot, be, rectified, short, of, re, evacuation, and, resealing, and, is, responsible, for, working, examples, of, such, tubes, becoming, rarer, and, rarer, unused, new, old, stock, tubes, can, also, exhibit, inert, gas, infiltration, so, there, is, no, long, term, guarantee, of, these, tube, types, surviving, into, the, future, large, transmitting, tubes, have, carbonized, tungsten, filaments, containing, a, small, trace, 1, to, 2, of, thorium, an, extremely, thin, molecular, layer, of, thorium, atoms, forms, on, the, outside, of, the, wire, s, carbonized, layer, and, when, heated, serve, as, an, efficient, source, of, electrons, the, thorium, slowly, evaporates, from, the, wire, surface, while, new, thorium, atoms, diffuse, to, the, surface, to, replace, them, such, thoriated, tungsten, cathodes, usually, deliver, lifetimes, in, the, tens, of, thousands, of, hours, the, end, of, life, scenario, for, a, thoriated, tungsten, filament, is, when, the, carbonized, layer, has, mostly, been, converted, back, into, another, form, of, tungsten, carbide, and, emission, begins, to, drop, off, rapidly, a, complete, loss, of, thorium, has, never, been, found, to, be, a, factor, in, the, end, of, life, in, a, tube, with, this, type, of, emitter, waay, tv, in, huntsville, alabama, achieved, 163, 000, hours, 18, 6, years, of, service, from, an, eimac, external, cavity, klystron, in, the, visual, circuit, of, its, transmitter, this, is, the, highest, documented, service, life, for, this, type, of, tube, it, has, been, said, that, transmitters, with, vacuum, tubes, are, better, able, to, survive, lightning, strikes, than, transistor, transmitters, do, while, it, was, commonly, believed, that, vacuum, tubes, were, more, efficient, than, solid, state, circuits, at, rf, power, levels, above, approximately, 20, kilowatts, this, is, no, longer, the, case, especially, in, medium, wave, am, broadcast, service, where, solid, state, transmitters, at, nearly, all, power, levels, have, measurably, higher, efficiency, fm, broadcast, transmitters, with, solid, state, power, amplifiers, up, to, approximately, 15, kw, also, show, better, overall, power, efficiency, than, tube, based, power, amplifiers, cathodes, in, small, receiving, tubes, are, coated, with, a, mixture, of, barium, oxide, and, strontium, oxide, sometimes, with, addition, of, calcium, oxide, or, aluminium, oxide, an, electric, heater, is, inserted, into, the, cathode, sleeve, and, insulated, from, it, electrically, by, a, coating, of, aluminum, oxide, this, complex, construction, causes, barium, and, strontium, atoms, to, diffuse, to, the, surface, of, the, cathode, and, emit, electrons, when, heated, to, about, 780, degrees, celsius, a, catastrophic, failure, is, one, that, suddenly, makes, the, vacuum, tube, unusable, a, crack, in, the, glass, envelope, will, allow, air, into, the, tube, and, destroy, it, cracks, may, result, from, stress, in, the, glass, bent, pins, or, impacts, tube, sockets, must, allow, for, thermal, expansion, to, prevent, stress, in, the, glass, at, the, pins, stress, may, accumulate, if, a, metal, shield, or, other, object, presses, on, the, tube, envelope, and, causes, differential, heating, of, the, glass, glass, may, also, be, damaged, by, high, voltage, arcing, tube, heaters, may, also, fail, without, warning, especially, if, exposed, to, over, voltage, or, as, a, result, of, manufacturing, defects, tube, heaters, do, not, normally, fail, by, evaporation, like, lamp, filaments, since, they, operate, at, much, lower, temperature, the, surge, of, inrush, current, when, the, heater, is, first, energized, causes, stress, in, the, heater, and, can, be, avoided, by, slowly, warming, the, heaters, gradually, increasing, current, with, a, ntc, thermistor, included, in, the, circuit, tubes, intended, for, series, string, operation, of, the, heaters, across, the, supply, have, a, specified, controlled, warm, up, time, to, avoid, excess, voltage, on, some, heaters, as, others, warm, up, directly, heated, filament, type, cathodes, as, used, in, battery, operated, tubes, or, some, rectifiers, may, fail, if, the, filament, sags, causing, internal, arcing, excess, heater, to, cathode, voltage, in, indirectly, heated, cathodes, can, break, down, the, insulation, between, elements, and, destroy, the, heater, arcing, between, tube, elements, can, destroy, the, tube, an, arc, can, be, caused, by, applying, voltage, to, the, anode, plate, before, the, cathode, has, come, up, to, operating, temperature, or, by, drawing, excess, current, through, a, rectifier, which, damages, the, emission, coating, arcs, can, also, be, initiated, by, any, loose, material, inside, the, tube, or, by, excess, screen, voltage, an, arc, inside, the, tube, allows, gas, to, evolve, from, the, tube, materials, and, may, deposit, conductive, material, on, internal, insulating, spacers, tube, rectifiers, have, limited, current, capability, and, exceeding, ratings, will, eventually, destroy, a, tube, degenerative, failures, are, those, caused, by, the, slow, deterioration, of, performance, over, time, overheating, of, internal, parts, such, as, control, grids, or, mica, spacer, insulators, can, result, in, trapped, gas, escaping, into, the, tube, this, can, reduce, performance, a, getter, is, used, to, absorb, gases, evolved, during, tube, operation, but, has, only, a, limited, ability, to, combine, with, gas, control, of, the, envelope, temperature, prevents, some, types, of, gassing, a, tube, with, an, unusually, high, level, of, internal, gas, may, exhibit, a, visible, blue, glow, when, plate, voltage, is, applied, the, getter, being, a, highly, reactive, metal, is, effective, against, many, atmospheric, gases, but, has, no, or, very, limited, chemical, reactivity, to, inert, gases, such, as, helium, one, progressive, type, of, failure, especially, with, physically, large, envelopes, such, as, those, used, by, camera, tubes, and, cathode, ray, tubes, comes, from, helium, infiltration, the, exact, mechanism, is, not, clear, the, metal, to, glass, lead, in, seals, are, one, possible, infiltration, site, gas, and, ions, within, the, tube, contribute, to, grid, current, which, can, disturb, operation, of, a, vacuum, tube, circuit, another, effect, of, overheating, is, the, slow, deposit, of, metallic, vapors, on, internal, spacers, resulting, in, inter, element, leakage, tubes, on, standby, for, long, periods, with, heater, voltage, applied, may, develop, high, cathode, interface, resistance, and, display, poor, emission, characteristics, this, effect, occurred, especially, in, pulse, and, digital, circuits, where, tubes, had, no, plate, current, flowing, for, extended, times, tubes, designed, specifically, for, this, mode, of, operation, were, made, cathode, depletion, is, the, loss, of, emission, after, thousands, of, hours, of, normal, use, sometimes, emission, can, be, restored, for, a, time, by, raising, heater, voltage, either, for, a, short, time, or, a, permanent, increase, of, a, few, percent, cathode, depletion, was, uncommon, in, signal, tubes, but, was, a, frequent, cause, of, failure, of, monochrome, television, cathode, ray, tubes, usable, life, of, this, expensive, component, was, sometimes, extended, by, fitting, a, boost, transformer, to, increase, heater, voltage, vacuum, tubes, may, develop, defects, in, operation, that, make, an, individual, tube, unsuitable, in, a, given, device, although, it, may, perform, satisfactorily, in, another, application, microphonics, refers, to, internal, vibrations, of, tube, elements, which, modulate, the, tube, s, signal, in, an, undesirable, way, sound, or, vibration, pick, up, may, affect, the, signals, or, even, cause, uncontrolled, howling, if, a, feedback, path, with, greater, than, unity, gain, develops, between, a, microphonic, tube, and, for, example, a, loudspeaker, leakage, current, between, ac, heaters, and, the, cathode, may, couple, into, the, circuit, or, electrons, emitted, directly, from, the, ends, of, the, heater, may, also, inject, hum, into, the, signal, leakage, current, due, to, internal, contamination, may, also, inject, noise, some, of, these, effects, make, tubes, unsuitable, for, small, signal, audio, use, although, unobjectionable, for, other, purposes, selecting, the, best, of, a, batch, of, nominally, identical, tubes, for, critical, applications, can, produce, better, results, tube, pins, can, develop, non, conducting, or, high, resistance, surface, films, due, to, heat, or, dirt, pins, can, be, cleaned, to, restore, conductance, vacuum, tubes, can, be, tested, outside, of, their, circuitry, using, a, vacuum, tube, tester, most, small, signal, vacuum, tube, devices, have, been, superseded, by, semiconductors, but, some, vacuum, tube, electronic, devices, are, still, in, common,

electrostatic, effects, these, are, efficient, usually, narrow, band, rf, generators, and, still, find, use, in, radar, microwave, ovens, and, industrial, heating, traveling, wave, tubes, twts, are, very, good, amplifiers, and, are, even, used, in, some, communications, satellites, high, powered, klystron, amplifier, tubes, can, provide, hundreds, of, kilowatts, in, the, uhf, range, the, cathode, ray, tube, crt, is, a, vacuum, tube, used, particularly, for, display, purposes, although, there, are, still, many, televisions, and, computer, monitors, using, cathode, ray, tubes, they, are, rapidly, being, replaced, by, flat, panel, displays, whose, quality, has, greatly, improved, even, as, their, prices, drop, this, is, also, true, of, digital, oscilloscopes, based, on, internal, computers, and, analog, to, digital, converters, although, traditional, analog, scopes, dependent, upon, crts, continue, to, be, produced, are, economical, and, preferred, by, many, technicians, at, one, time, many, radios, used, magic, eye, tubes, a, specialized, sort, of, crt, used, in, place, of, a, meter, movement, to, indicate, signal, strength, or, input, level, in, a, tape, recorder, a, modern, indicator, device, the, vacuum, fluorescent, display, vfd, is, also, a, sort, of, cathode, ray, tube, the, x, ray, tube, is, a, type, of, cathode, ray, tube, that, generates, x, rays, when, high, voltage, electrons, hit, the, anode, gyrotrons, or, vacuum, masers, used, to, generate, high, power, millimeter, band, waves, are, magnetic, vacuum, tubes, in, which, a, small, relativistic, effect, due, to, the, high, voltage, is, used, for, bunching, the, electrons, gyrotrons, can, generate, very, high, powers, hundreds, of, kilowatts, free, electron, lasers, used, to, generate, high, power, coherent, light, and, even, x, rays, are, highly, relativistic, vacuum, tubes, driven, by, high, energy, particle, accelerators, thus, these, are, sorts, of, cathode, ray, tubes, a, photomultiplier, is, a, phototube, whose, sensitivity, is, greatly, increased, through, the, use, of, electron, multiplication, this, works, on, the, principle, of, secondary, emission, whereby, a, single, electron, emitted, by, the, photocathode, strikes, a, special, sort, of, anode, known, as, a, dynode, causing, more, electrons, to, be, released, from, that, dynode, those, electrons, are, accelerated, toward, another, dynode, at, a, higher, voltage, releasing, more, secondary, electrons, as, many, as, 15, such, stages, provide, a, huge, amplification, despite, great, advances, in, solid, state, photodetectors, e, g, single, photon, avalanche, diode, the, single, photon, detection, capability, of, photomultiplier, tubes, makes, this, vacuum, tube, device, excel, in, certain, applications, such, a, tube, can, also, be, used, for, detection, of, ionizing, radiation, as, an, alternative, to, the, geiger, m, ller, tube, itself, not, an, actual, vacuum, tube, historically, the, image, orthicon, tv, camera, tube, widely, used, in, television, studios, prior, to, the, development, of, modern, ccd, arrays, also, used, multistage, electron, multiplication, for, decades, electron, tube, designers, tried, to, augment, amplifying, tubes, with, electron, multipliers, in, order, to, increase, gain, but, these, suffered, from, short, life, because, the, material, used, for, the, dynodes, poisoned, the, tube, s, hot, cathode, for, instance, the, interesting, rca, 1630, secondary, emission, tube, was, marketed, but, did, not, last, however, eventually, philips, of, the, netherlands, developed, the, efp60, tube, that, had, a, satisfactory, lifetime, and, was, used, in, at, least, one, product, a, laboratory, pulse, generator, by, that, time, however, transistors, were, rapidly, improving, making, such, developments, superfluous, one, variant, called, a, channel, electron, multiplier, does, not, use, individual, dynodes, but, consists, of, a, curved, tube, such, as, a, helix, coated, on, the, inside, with, material, with, good, secondary, emission, one, type, had, a, funnel, of, sorts, to, capture, the, secondary, electrons, the, continuous, dynode, was, resistive, and, its, ends, were, connected, to, enough, voltage, to, create, repeated, cascades, of, electrons, the, microchannel, plate, consists, of, an, array, of, single, stage, electron, multipliers, over, an, image, plane, several, of, these, can, then, be, stacked, this, can, be, used, for, instance, as, an, image, intensifier, in, which, the, discrete, channels, substitute, for, focusing, tektronix, made, a, high, performance, wideband, oscilloscope, crt, with, a, channel, electron, multiplier, plate, behind, the, phosphor, layer, this, plate, was, a, bundled, array, of, a, huge, number, of, short, individual, c, e, m, tubes, that, accepted, a, low, current, beam, and, intensified, it, to, provide, a, display, of, practical, brightness, the, electron, optics, of, the, wideband, electron, gun, could, not, provide, enough, current, to, directly, excite, the, phosphor, although, vacuum, tubes, have, been, largely, replaced, by, solid, state, devices, in, most, amplifying, switching, and, rectifying, applications, there, are, certain, exceptions, in, addition, to, the, special, functions, noted, above, tubes, still, have, some, niche, applications, in, general, vacuum, tubes, are, much, less, susceptible, than, corresponding, solid, state, components, to, transient, overvoltages, such, as, mains, voltage, surges, or, lightning, the, electromagnetic, pulse, effect, of, nuclear, explosions, or, geomagnetic, storms, produced, by, giant, solar, flares, this, property, kept, them, in, use, for, certain, military, applications, long, after, more, practical, and, less, expensive, solid, state, technology, was, available, for, the, same, applications, as, for, example, with, the, mig, 25, vacuum, tubes, are, practical, alternatives, to, solid, state, devices, in, generating, high, power, at, radio, frequencies, in, applications, such, as, industrial, radio, frequency, heating, particle, accelerators, and, broadcast, transmitters, this, is, particularly, true, at, microwave, frequencies, where, such, devices, as, the, klystron, and, traveling, wave, tube, provide, amplification, at, power, levels, unattainable, using, current, semiconductor, devices, the, household, microwave, oven, uses, a, magnetron, tube, to, efficiently, generate, hundreds, of, watts, of, microwave, power, solid, state, devices, such, as, gallium, nitride, are, promising, replacements, but, are, very, expensive, and, in, early, stages, of, development, in, military, applications, a, high, power, vacuum, tube, can, generate, a, 10, 100, megawatt, signal, that, can, burn, out, an, unprotected, receiver, s, frontend, such, devices, are, considered, non, nuclear, electromagnetic, weapons, they, were, introduced, in, the, late, 1990s, by, both, the, u, s, and, russia, tube, amplifiers, remain, commercially, viable, in, three, niches, where, their, warm, sound, performance, when, overdriven, and, ability, to, replicate, prior, era, tube, based, recording, are, prized, audiophile, equipment, musical, instrument, amplifiers, and, devices, used, in, recording, studios, many, guitarists, prefer, using, valve, amplifiers, to, solid, state, models, often, due, to, the, way, they, tend, to, distort, when, overdriven, any, amplifier, can, only, accurately, amplify, a, signal, to, a, certain, volume, past, this, limit, the, amplifier, will, begin, to, distort, the, signal, different, circuits, will, distort, the, signal, in, different, ways, some, guitarists, prefer, the, distortion, characteristics, of, vacuum, tubes, most, popular, vintage, models, use, vacuum, tubes, the, cathode, ray, tube, was, the, dominant, display, technology, for, televisions, and, computer, monitors, at, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, however, rapid, advances, and, falling, prices, of, lcd, flat, panel, technology, soon, took, the, place, of, crts, in, these, devices, by, 2010, most, crt, production, had, ended, in, the, early, years, of, the, 21st, century, there, has, been, renewed, interest, in, vacuum, tubes, this, time, with, the, electron, emitter, formed, on, a, flat, silicon, substrate, as, in, integrated, circuit, technology, this, subject, is, now, called, vacuum, nanoelectronics, the, most, common, design, uses, a, cold, cathode, in, the, form, of, a, large, area, field, electron, source, for, example, a, field, emitter, array, with, these, devices, electrons, are, field, emitted, from, a, large, number, of, closely, spaced, individual, emission, sites, such, integrated, microtubes, may, find, application, in, microwave, devices, including, mobile, phones, for, bluetooth, and, wi, fi, transmission, and, in, radar, and, satellite, communication, as, of, 2012, they, were, being, studied, for, possible, applications, in, field, emission, display, technology, but, there, were, significant, production, problems, as, of, 2014, nasa, s, ames, research, center, was, reported, to, be, working, on, vacuum, channel, transistors, produced, using, cmos, techniques, when, a, cathode, is, heated, and, reaches, an, operating, temperature, around, 1050, kelvin, 780, c, free, electrons, are, driven, from, its, surface, these, free, electrons, form, a, cloud, in, the, empty, space, between, the, cathode, and, the, anode, known, as, the, space, charge, this, space, charge, cloud, supplies, the, electrons, that, create, the, current, flow, from, the, cathode, to, the, anode, as, electrons, are, drawn, to, the, anode, during, the, operation, of, the, circuit, new, electrons, will, boil, off, the, cathode, to, replenish, the, space, charge, the, space, charge, is, an, example, of, an, electric, field, all, tubes, with, one, or, more, control, grids, are, controlled, by, an, ac, alternating, current, input, voltage, applied, to, the, control, grid, while, the, resulting, amplified, signal, appears, at, the, anode, as, a, current, due, to, the, high, voltage, placed, on, the, anode, a, relatively, small, anode, current, can, represent, a, considerable, increase, in, energy, over, the, value, of, the, original, signal, voltage, the, space, charge, electrons, driven, off, the, heated, cathode, are, strongly, attracted, by, the, positive, anode, the, control, grid, s, in, a, tube, mediate, this, current, flow, by, combining, the, small, ac, signal, current, with, the, grid, s, slightly, negative, value, when, the, signal, sine, ac, wave, is, applied, to, the, grid, it, rides, on, this, negative, value, driving, it, both, positive, and, negative, as, the, ac, signal, wave, changes, this, relationship, is, shown, with, a, set, of, plate, characteristics, curves, see, example, above, which, visually, display, how, the, output, current, from, the, anode, i, a, can, be, affected, by, a, small, input, voltage, applied, on, the, grid, v, g, for, any, given, voltage, on, the, plate, anode, v, a, every, tube, has, a, unique, set, of, such, characteristic, curves, the, curves, graphically, relate, the, changes, to, the, instantaneous, plate, current, driven, by, a, much, smaller, change, in, the, grid, to, cathode, voltage, v, gk, as, the, input, signal, varies, the, v, i, characteristic, depends, upon, the, size, and, material, of, the, plate, and, cathode, express, the, ratio, between, voltage, plate, and, plate, current, size, of, electrostatic, field, is, the, size, between, two, or, more, plates, in, the, tube
