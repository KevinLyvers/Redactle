paint, is, a, material, or, mixture, that, when, applied, to, a, solid, material, and, allowed, to, dry, adds, a, film, like, layer, as, art, this, is, used, to, create, an, image, or, images, known, as, a, painting, paint, can, be, made, in, many, colors, and, types, most, paints, are, either, oil, based, or, water, based, and, each, has, distinct, characteristics, primitive, forms, of, paint, were, used, tens, of, thousands, of, years, ago, in, cave, paintings, clean, up, solvents, are, also, different, for, water, based, paint, than, oil, based, paint, water, based, paints, and, oil, based, paints, will, cure, differently, based, on, the, outside, ambient, temperature, of, the, object, being, painted, such, as, a, house, usually, the, object, being, painted, must, be, over, 10, c, 50, f, although, some, manufacturers, of, external, paints, primers, claim, they, can, be, applied, when, temperatures, are, as, low, as, 2, c, 35, f, paint, was, used, in, some, of, the, earliest, known, human, artworks, some, cave, paintings, drawn, with, red, or, yellow, ochre, hematite, manganese, oxide, and, charcoal, may, have, been, made, by, early, homo, sapiens, as, long, as, 40, 000, years, ago, paint, may, be, even, older, in, 2003, and, 2004, south, african, archeologists, reported, finds, in, blombos, cave, of, a, 100, 000, year, old, human, made, ochre, based, mixture, that, could, have, been, used, like, paint, further, excavation, in, the, same, cave, resulted, in, the, 2011, report, of, a, complete, toolkit, for, grinding, pigments, and, making, a, primitive, paint, like, substance, interior, walls, at, the, 5, 000, year, old, ness, of, brodgar, have, been, found, to, incorporate, individual, stones, painted, in, yellows, reds, and, oranges, using, ochre, pigment, made, of, haematite, mixed, with, animal, fat, milk, or, eggs, ancient, colored, walls, at, dendera, egypt, which, were, exposed, for, years, to, the, elements, still, possess, their, brilliant, color, as, vivid, as, when, they, were, painted, about, 2, 000, years, ago, the, egyptians, mixed, their, colors, with, a, gummy, substance, and, applied, them, separately, from, each, other, without, any, blending, or, mixture, they, appear, to, have, used, six, colors, white, black, blue, red, yellow, and, green, they, first, covered, the, area, entirely, with, white, then, traced, the, design, in, black, leaving, out, the, lights, of, the, ground, color, they, used, minium, for, red, generally, of, a, dark, tinge, the, oldest, known, oil, paintings, are, buddhist, murals, created, c, 650, ad, the, works, are, located, in, cave, like, rooms, carved, from, the, cliffs, of, afghanistan, s, bamiyan, valley, using, walnut, and, poppy, seed, oils, pliny, mentions, some, painted, ceilings, in, his, day, in, the, town, of, ardea, which, had, been, made, before, the, foundation, of, rome, after, the, lapse, of, so, many, centuries, he, expressed, great, surprise, and, admiration, at, their, freshness, in, the, 13th, century, oil, was, used, to, detail, tempera, paintings, in, the, 14th, century, cennino, cennini, described, a, painting, technique, utilizing, tempera, painting, covered, by, light, layers, of, oil, the, slow, drying, properties, of, organic, oils, were, commonly, known, to, early, european, painters, however, the, difficulty, in, acquiring, and, working, the, materials, meant, that, they, were, rarely, used, and, indeed, the, slow, drying, was, seen, as, a, disadvantage, the, paint, was, made, with, the, yolk, of, eggs, and, therefore, the, substance, would, harden, and, adhere, to, the, surface, it, was, applied, to, the, pigment, was, made, from, plants, sand, and, different, soils, most, paints, use, either, oil, or, water, as, a, base, the, diluent, solvent, or, vehicle, for, the, pigment, the, flemish, trained, or, influenced, antonello, da, messina, who, vasari, wrongly, credited, with, the, introduction, of, oil, paint, to, italy, does, seem, to, have, improved, the, formula, by, adding, litharge, or, lead, ii, oxide, a, still, extant, example, of, 17th, century, house, oil, painting, is, ham, house, in, surrey, england, where, a, primer, was, used, along, with, several, undercoats, and, an, elaborate, decorative, overcoat, the, pigment, and, oil, mixture, would, have, been, ground, into, a, paste, with, a, mortar, and, pestle, the, painters, did, the, process, by, hand, which, exposed, them, to, lead, poisoning, due, to, the, white, lead, powder, in, 1718, marshall, smith, invented, a, machine, or, engine, for, the, grinding, of, colours, in, england, it, is, not, known, precisely, how, it, operated, but, it, was, a, device, that, dramatically, increased, the, efficiency, of, pigment, grinding, soon, a, company, called, emerton, and, manby, was, advertising, exceptionally, low, priced, paints, that, had, been, ground, with, labor, saving, technology, one, pound, of, colour, ground, in, a, horse, mill, will, paint, twelve, yards, of, work, whereas, colour, ground, any, other, way, will, not, do, half, that, quantity, by, the, proper, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, mid, 18th, century, paint, was, being, ground, in, steam, powered, mills, and, an, alternative, to, lead, based, pigments, had, been, found, in, a, white, derivative, of, zinc, oxide, interior, house, painting, increasingly, became, the, norm, as, the, 19th, century, progressed, both, for, decorative, reasons, and, because, the, paint, was, effective, in, preventing, the, walls, rotting, from, damp, linseed, oil, was, also, increasingly, used, as, an, inexpensive, binder, in, 1866, sherwin, williams, in, the, united, states, opened, as, a, large, paint, maker, and, invented, a, paint, that, could, be, used, from, the, tin, without, preparation, it, was, only, when, the, stimulus, of, world, war, ii, created, a, shortage, of, linseed, oil, in, the, supply, market, that, artificial, resins, or, alkyds, were, invented, cheap, and, easy, to, make, they, held, the, color, well, and, lasted, for, a, long, time, through, the, 20th, century, paints, used, pigments, typically, suspended, in, a, liquid, in, the, 21st, century, paints, that, used, structural, color, were, created, aluminum, flakes, dotted, with, smaller, aluminum, nanoparticles, could, be, tuned, to, produce, arbitrary, colors, by, adjusting, the, nanoparticle, sizes, rather, than, picking, mixing, minerals, to, do, so, these, paints, weighed, a, tiny, fraction, of, the, weight, of, conventional, paints, a, particular, advantage, in, air, and, road, vehicles, they, reflect, heat, from, sunlight, and, do, not, break, down, outdoors, preliminary, experiments, suggest, it, can, reduce, temperatures, by, 20, to, 30, degrees, fahrenheit, vs, conventional, paint, its, constituents, are, also, less, toxic, making, the, paint, starts, with, a, thin, double, sided, mirror, the, researchers, deposited, metallic, nanoparticles, on, both, sides, of, the, sheet, large, sheets, were, ground, to, produce, small, flakes, the, vehicle, is, composed, of, binder, if, it, is, necessary, to, thin, it, with, a, diluent, like, solvent, or, water, it, is, a, combination, of, binder, and, diluent, in, this, case, once, the, paint, has, dried, or, cured, very, nearly, all, of, the, diluent, has, evaporated, and, only, the, binder, is, left, on, the, coated, surface, thus, an, important, quantity, in, coatings, formulation, is, the, vehicle, solids, sometimes, called, the, resin, solids, of, the, formula, this, is, the, proportion, of, the, wet, coating, weight, that, is, binder, i, e, the, polymer, backbone, of, the, film, that, will, remain, after, drying, or, curing, is, complete, the, volume, of, paint, after, it, has, dried, therefore, only, leaving, the, solids, is, expressed, as, the, volume, solid, the, binder, is, the, film, forming, component, of, paint, it, is, the, only, component, that, is, always, present, among, all, the, various, types, of, formulations, many, binders, must, be, thick, enough, to, be, applied, and, thinned, the, type, of, thinner, if, present, varies, with, the, binder, the, binder, imparts, properties, such, as, gloss, durability, flexibility, and, toughness, binders, include, synthetic, or, natural, resins, such, as, alkyds, acrylics, vinyl, acrylics, vinyl, acetate, ethylene, vae, polyurethanes, polyesters, melamine, resins, epoxy, silanes, or, siloxanes, or, oils, binders, can, be, categorized, according, to, the, mechanisms, for, film, formation, thermoplastic, mechanisms, include, drying, and, coalescence, drying, refers, to, simply, evaporating, the, solvent, or, thinner, to, leave, a, coherent, film, behind, coalescence, refers, to, a, mechanism, that, involves, drying, followed, by, actual, interpenetration, and, fusion, of, formerly, discrete, particles, thermoplastic, film, forming, mechanisms, are, sometimes, described, as, thermoplastic, cure, but, that, is, a, misnomer, because, no, chemical, curing, reactions, are, required, to, knit, the, film, on, the, other, hand, thermosetting, mechanisms, are, true, curing, mechanisms, involving, chemical, reaction, s, among, the, polymers, that, make, up, the, binder, some, films, are, formed, by, simply, cooling, the, binder, for, example, encaustic, or, wax, paints, are, liquid, when, warm, and, harden, upon, cooling, in, many, cases, they, re, soften, or, liquify, if, reheated, paints, that, dry, by, solvent, evaporation, and, contain, the, solid, binder, dissolved, in, a, solvent, are, known, as, lacquers, a, solid, film, forms, when, the, solvent, evaporates, because, no, chemical, crosslinking, is, involved, the, film, can, re, dissolve, in, solvent, lacquers, are, unsuitable, for, applications, where, chemical, resistance, is, important, classic, nitrocellulose, lacquers, fall, into, this, category, as, do, non, grain, raising, stains, composed, of, dyes, dissolved, in, solvent, performance, varies, by, formulation, but, lacquers, generally, tend, to, have, better, uv, resistance, and, lower, corrosion, resistance, than, comparable, systems, that, cure, by, polymerization, or, coalescence, the, paint, type, known, as, emulsion, in, the, uk, and, latex, in, the, united, states, is, a, water, borne, dispersion, of, sub, micrometer, polymer, particles, these, terms, in, their, respective, countries, cover, all, paints, that, use, synthetic, polymers, such, as, acrylic, vinyl, acrylic, pva, styrene, acrylic, etc, as, binders, the, term, latex, in, the, context, of, paint, in, the, united, states, simply, means, an, aqueous, dispersion, latex, rubber, from, the, rubber, tree, is, not, an, ingredient, these, dispersions, are, prepared, by, emulsion, polymerization, such, paints, cure, by, a, process, called, coalescence, where, first, the, water, and, then, the, trace, or, coalescing, solvent, evaporate, and, draw, together, and, soften, the, binder, particles, and, fuse, them, together, into, irreversibly, bound, networked, structures, so, that, the, paint, cannot, redissolve, in, the, solvent, water, that, originally, carried, it, the, residual, surfactants, in, paint, as, well, as, hydrolytic, effects, with, some, polymers, cause, the, paint, to, remain, susceptible, to, softening, and, over, time, degradation, by, water, the, general, term, of, latex, paint, is, usually, used, in, the, united, states, while, the, term, emulsion, paint, is, used, for, the, same, products, in, the, uk, and, the, term, latex, paint, is, not, used, at, all, paints, that, cure, by, polymerization, are, generally, one, or, two, package, coatings, that, polymerize, by, way, of, a, chemical, reaction, and, cure, into, a, cross, linked, film, depending, on, composition, they, may, need, to, dry, first, by, evaporation, of, solvent, classic, two, package, epoxies, or, polyurethanes, would, fall, into, this, category, the, drying, oils, counter, intuitively, cure, by, a, crosslinking, reaction, even, if, they, are, not, put, through, an, oven, cycle, and, seem, to, dry, in, air, the, film, formation, mechanism, of, the, simplest, examples, involves, the, first, evaporation, of, solvents, followed, by, a, reaction, with, oxygen, from, the, environment, over, a, period, of, days, weeks, and, even, months, to, create, a, crosslinked, network, classic, alkyd, enamels, would, fall, into, this, category, oxidative, cure, coatings, are, catalyzed, by, metal, complex, driers, such, as, cobalt, naphthenate, though, cobalt, octoate, is, more, common, recent, environmental, requirements, restrict, the, use, of, volatile, organic, compounds, vocs, and, alternative, means, of, curing, have, been, developed, generally, for, industrial, purposes, uv, curing, paints, for, example, enable, formulation, with, very, low, amounts, of, solvent, or, even, none, at, all, this, can, be, achieved, because, of, the, monomers, and, oligomers, used, in, the, coating, have, relatively, very, low, molecular, weight, and, are, therefore, low, enough, in, viscosity, to, enable, good, fluid, flow, without, the, need, for, additional, thinner, if, solvent, is, present, in, significant, amounts, generally, it, is, mostly, evaporated, first, and, then, crosslinking, is, initiated, by, ultraviolet, light, similarly, powder, coatings, contain, no, solvent, flow, and, cure, are, produced, by, the, heating, of, the, substrate, after, electrostatic, application, of, the, dry, powder, so, called, catalyzed, lacquers, or, crosslinking, latex, coatings, are, designed, to, form, films, by, a, combination, of, methods, classic, drying, plus, a, curing, reaction, that, benefits, from, the, catalyst, there, are, paints, called, plastisols, organosols, which, are, made, by, blending, pvc, granules, with, a, plasticiser, these, are, stoved, and, the, mix, coalesces, the, main, purposes, of, the, diluent, are, to, dissolve, the, polymer, and, adjust, the, viscosity, of, the, paint, it, is, volatile, and, does, not, become, part, of, the, paint, film, it, also, controls, flow, and, application, properties, and, in, some, cases, can, affect, the, stability, of, the, paint, while, in, liquid, state, its, main, function, is, as, the, carrier, for, the, non, volatile, components, to, spread, heavier, oils, for, example, linseed, as, in, oil, based, interior, house, paint, a, thinner, oil, is, required, these, volatile, substances, impart, their, properties, temporarily, once, the, solvent, has, evaporated, the, remaining, paint, is, fixed, to, the, surface, this, component, is, optional, some, paints, have, no, diluent, water, is, the, main, diluent, for, water, borne, paints, even, the, co, solvent, types, solvent, borne, also, called, oil, based, paints, can, have, various, combinations, of, organic, solvents, as, the, diluent, including, aliphatics, aromatics, alcohols, ketones, and, white, spirit, specific, examples, are, organic, solvents, such, as, petroleum, distillate, esters, glycol, ethers, and, the, like, sometimes, volatile, low, molecular, weight, synthetic, resins, also, serve, as, diluents, pigments, are, solid, particles, or, flakes, incorporated, in, the, paint, usually, to, contribute, color, to, the, paint, film, pigments, impart, color, by, selective, absorption, of, certain, wavelengths, of, light, and, or, by, scattering, or, reflecting, light, the, particle, size, of, the, pigment, is, critical, to, the, light, scattering, mechanism, the, size, of, such, particles, can, be, measured, with, a, hegman, gauge, dyes, on, the, other, hand, are, dissolve, in, the, paint, and, impart, color, only, by, the, selective, absorption, mechanism, paints, can, be, formulated, with, only, pigments, only, dyes, both, or, neither, pigments, can, also, be, used, to, give, the, paint, special, physical, or, optical, properties, as, opposed, to, imparting, color, in, which, case, they, are, called, functional, pigments, fillers, or, extenders, are, an, important, class, of, the, functional, pigments, these, are, typically, used, to, build, film, thickness, and, or, reduce, the, cost, of, the, paint, or, they, can, impart, toughness, and, texture, to, the, film, fillers, are, usually, cheap, and, inert, materials, such, as, diatomaceous, earth, talc, lime, barytes, clay, etc, floor, paints, that, must, resist, abrasion, may, contain, fine, quartz, sand, as, a, filler, sometimes, a, single, pigment, can, serve, both, decorative, and, functional, purposes, for, example, some, decorative, pigments, protect, the, substrate, from, the, harmful, effects, of, ultraviolet, light, by, making, the, paint, opaque, to, these, wavelengths, i, e, by, selectively, absorbing, them, these, hiding, pigments, include, titanium, dioxide, phthalo, blue, red, iron, oxide, and, many, others, some, pigments, are, toxic, such, as, the, lead, pigments, that, are, used, in, lead, paint, paint, manufacturers, began, replacing, white, lead, pigments, with, titanium, white, titanium, dioxide, before, lead, was, banned, in, paint, for, residential, use, in, 1978, by, the, us, consumer, product, safety, commission, the, titanium, dioxide, used, in, most, paints, today, is, often, coated, with, silica, alumina, zirconium, for, various, reasons, such, as, better, exterior, durability, or, better, hiding, performance, opacity, promoted, by, more, optimal, spacing, within, the, paint, film, micaceous, iron, oxide, mio, is, another, alternative, to, lead, for, protection, of, steel, giving, more, protection, against, water, and, light, damage, than, most, paints, when, mio, pigments, are, ground, into, fine, particles, most, cleave, into, shiny, layers, which, reflect, light, thus, minimising, uv, degradation, and, protecting, the, resin, binder, most, pigments, used, in, paint, tend, to, be, spherical, but, lamellar, pigments, such, as, glass, flake, and, mio, have, overlapping, plates, which, impede, the, path, of, water, molecules, for, optimum, performance, mio, should, have, a, high, content, of, thin, flake, like, particles, resembling, mica, iso, 10601, sets, two, levels, of, mio, content, mio, is, often, derived, from, a, form, of, hematite, pigments, can, be, classified, as, either, natural, or, synthetic, natural, pigments, are, taken, from, the, earth, or, plant, sources, and, include, colorants, such, as, metal, oxides, or, carbon, black, or, various, clays, calcium, carbonate, mica, silicas, and, talcs, synthetics, include, a, host, of, colorants, created, in, the, lab, as, well, as, engineered, molecules, calcined, clays, blanc, fixe, precipitated, calcium, carbonate, and, synthetic, pyrogenic, silicas, the, pigments, and, dyes, that, are, used, as, colorants, are, classified, by, chemical, type, using, the, color, index, system, which, is, commercially, significant, besides, the, three, main, categories, of, ingredients, binder, diluent, pigment, paint, can, have, a, wide, variety, of, miscellaneous, additives, which, are, usually, added, in, small, amounts, yet, provide, a, significant, effect, on, the, product, some, examples, include, additives, to, modify, surface, tension, improve, flow, properties, improve, the, finished, appearance, increase, wet, edge, improve, pigment, stability, impart, antifreeze, properties, control, foaming, control, skinning, create, acrylic, pouring, cells, etc, other, types, of, additives, include, catalysts, thickeners, stabilizers, emulsifiers, texturizers, adhesion, promoters, uv, stabilizers, flatteners, de, glossing, agents, biocides, to, fight, bacterial, growth, and, the, like, additives, normally, do, not, significantly, alter, the, percentages, of, individual, components, in, a, formulation, various, technologies, exist, for, making, paints, that, change, color, thermochromic, ink, and, coatings, contain, materials, that, change, conformation, when, heat, is, applied, or, removed, and, so, they, change, color, liquid, crystals, have, been, used, in, such, paints, such, as, in, the, thermometer, strips, and, tapes, used, in, aquaria, and, novelty, promotional, thermal, cups, and, straws, photochromic, materials, are, used, to, make, eyeglasses, and, other, products, similar, to, thermochromic, molecules, photochromic, molecules, change, conformation, when, light, energy, is, applied, or, removed, and, so, they, change, color, color, changing, paints, can, also, be, made, by, adding, halochromic, compounds, or, other, organic, pigments, one, patent, cites, use, of, these, indicators, for, wall, coating, applications, for, light, colored, paints, when, the, paint, is, wet, it, is, pink, in, color, but, upon, drying, it, regains, its, original, white, color, as, cited, in, patent, this, property, of, the, paint, enabled, two, or, more, coats, to, be, applied, on, a, wall, properly, and, evenly, the, previous, coats, having, dried, would, be, white, whereas, the, new, wet, coat, would, be, distinctly, pink, ashland, inc, introduced, foundry, refractory, coatings, with, similar, principle, in, 2005, for, use, in, foundries, electrochromic, paints, change, color, in, response, to, an, applied, electric, current, car, manufacturer, nissan, has, been, reportedly, working, on, an, electrochromic, paint, based, on, particles, of, paramagnetic, iron, oxide, when, subjected, to, an, electromagnetic, field, the, paramagnetic, particles, change, spacing, modifying, their, color, and, reflective, properties, the, electromagnetic, field, would, be, formed, using, the, conductive, metal, of, the, car, body, electrochromic, paints, can, be, applied, to, plastic, substrates, as, well, using, a, different, coating, chemistry, the, technology, involves, using, special, dyes, that, change, conformation, when, an, electric, current, is, applied, across, the, film, itself, this, new, technology, has, been, used, to, achieve, glare, protection, at, the, touch, of, a, button, in, passenger, airplane, windows, color, can, also, change, depending, on, viewing, angle, using, iridescence, for, example, in, chromaflair, since, the, time, of, the, renaissance, siccative, drying, oil, paints, primarily, linseed, oil, have, been, the, most, commonly, used, kind, of, paints, in, fine, art, applications, oil, paint, is, still, common, today, however, in, the, 20th, century, new, water, borne, paints, such, acrylic, paints, entered, the, market, with, the, development, of, acrylic, and, other, latex, paints, milk, paints, also, called, casein, where, the, medium, is, derived, from, the, natural, emulsion, that, is, milk, were, common, in, the, 19th, century, and, are, still, used, used, by, the, earliest, western, artists, egg, tempera, where, the, medium, is, an, emulsion, of, raw, egg, yolk, mixed, with, oil, remains, in, use, as, well, as, are, encaustic, wax, based, paints, gouache, is, an, opaque, variant, of, watercolor, which, is, based, around, varying, levels, of, translucency, both, paints, use, gum, arabic, as, the, binder, and, water, as, a, thinner, gouache, is, also, known, as, designer, color, or, body, color, poster, paint, is, a, distemper, paint, that, has, been, used, primarily, in, the, creation, of, student, works, or, by, children, there, are, varying, brands, of, poster, paint, and, depending, on, the, brand, the, quality, will, differ, more, inexpensive, brands, will, often, crack, or, fade, over, time, if, they, are, left, on, a, poster, for, an, extended, time, paint, can, be, applied, as, a, solid, a, gas, a, gaseous, suspension, aerosol, or, a, liquid, techniques, vary, depending, on, the, practical, or, artistic, results, desired, as, a, solid, usually, used, in, industrial, and, automotive, applications, the, paint, is, applied, as, a, very, fine, powder, then, baked, at, high, temperature, this, melts, the, powder, and, causes, it, to, adhere, to, the, surface, the, reasons, for, doing, this, involve, the, chemistries, of, the, paint, the, surface, itself, and, perhaps, even, the, chemistry, of, the, substrate, the, object, being, painted, this, is, called, powder, coating, an, object, in, a, gas, phase, application, the, coating, composition, is, introduced, if, gaseous, vaporized, if, liquid, or, sublimed, if, solid, then, deposited, on, a, distant, substrate, often, under, vacuum, these, applications, are, classed, broadly, into, physical, vapor, deposition, methods, like, sputtering, or, vacuum, deposition, in, which, solid, or, liquid, starting, materials, produce, a, vapor, that, condenses, on, the, substrate, or, chemical, vapor, deposition, methods, in, which, gaseous, starting, materials, chemically, react, with, the, substrate, to, form, a, coating, these, techniques, are, especially, important, in, the, electronics, and, optical, industries, as, a, gaseous, suspension, liquid, paint, is, aerosolized, by, the, force, of, compressed, air, or, by, the, action, of, high, pressure, compression, of, the, paint, itself, and, the, paint, is, turned, into, small, droplets, that, travel, to, the, article, to, be, painted, alternate, methods, are, airless, spray, hot, spray, hot, airless, spray, and, any, of, these, with, an, electrostatic, spray, included, there, are, numerous, electrostatic, methods, available, the, reasons, for, doing, this, include, in, a, liquid, application, paint, can, be, applied, by, direct, application, using, brushes, paint, rollers, blades, scrapers, other, instruments, or, body, parts, such, as, fingers, and, thumbs, rollers, generally, have, a, handle, that, allows, for, different, lengths, of, poles, to, be, attached, allowing, painting, at, different, heights, generally, roller, application, requires, two, coats, for, an, even, color, a, roller, with, a, thicker, nap, is, used, to, apply, paint, on, uneven, surfaces, edges, are, often, finished, with, an, angled, brush, after, liquid, paint, is, applied, there, is, an, interval, during, which, it, can, be, blended, with, additional, painted, regions, at, the, wet, edge, called, open, time, the, open, time, of, an, oil, or, alkyd, based, emulsion, paint, can, be, extended, by, adding, white, spirit, similar, glycols, such, as, dowanol, propylene, glycol, ether, or, open, time, prolongers, this, can, also, facilitate, the, mixing, of, different, wet, paint, layers, for, aesthetic, effect, latex, and, acrylic, emulsions, require, the, use, of, drying, retardants, suitable, for, water, based, coatings, depending, on, the, quality, and, type, of, liquid, paint, used, the, open, time, will, vary, oil, paints, for, instance, are, renowned, for, their, open, time, as, oil, paints, allow, for, artists, to, blend, the, colors, for, extended, periods, of, time, without, having, to, add, any, extending, agents, dipping, used, to, be, the, norm, for, objects, such, as, filing, cabinets, but, this, has, been, replaced, by, high, speed, air, turbine, driven, bells, with, electrostatic, spray, car, bodies, are, primed, using, cathodic, elephoretic, primer, which, is, applied, by, charging, the, body, depositing, a, layer, of, primer, the, unchanged, residue, is, rinsed, off, and, the, primer, stoved, many, paints, tend, to, separate, when, stored, the, heavier, components, settling, to, the, bottom, and, require, mixing, before, use, some, paint, outlets, have, machines, for, mixing, the, paint, by, shaking, the, can, vigorously, for, a, few, minutes, the, opacity, and, the, film, thickness, of, paint, may, be, measured, using, a, drawdown, card, water, based, paints, tend, to, be, the, easiest, to, clean, up, after, use, the, brushes, and, rollers, can, be, cleaned, with, soap, and, water, proper, disposal, of, left, over, paint, is, a, challenge, sometimes, it, can, be, recycled, old, paint, may, be, usable, for, a, primer, coat, or, an, intermediate, coat, and, paints, of, similar, chemistry, can, be, mixed, to, make, a, larger, amount, of, a, uniform, color, to, dispose, of, paint, it, can, be, dried, and, disposed, of, in, the, domestic, waste, stream, provided, that, it, contains, no, prohibited, substances, see, container, disposal, of, liquid, paint, usually, requires, special, handling, and, should, be, treated, as, hazardous, waste, and, disposed, of, according, to, local, regulations, the, main, reasons, for, paint, failure, after, application, on, the, surface, are, the, applicator, and, improper, treatment, of, the, surface, defects, or, degradation, can, be, attributed, to, volatile, organic, compounds, vocs, in, paint, are, considered, harmful, to, the, environment, and, especially, for, people, who, work, with, them, on, a, regular, basis, exposure, to, vocs, has, been, related, to, organic, solvent, syndrome, although, this, relation, has, been, somewhat, controversial, the, controversial, solvent, 2, butoxyethanol, is, also, used, in, paint, production, jurisdictions, such, as, canada, china, the, eu, india, the, united, states, and, south, korea, have, definitions, for, vocs, in, place, along, with, regulations, to, limit, the, use, of, vocs, in, consumer, products, such, as, paint, in, the, us, environmental, regulations, consumer, demand, and, advances, in, technology, led, to, the, development, of, low, voc, and, zero, voc, paints, and, finishes, these, new, paints, are, widely, available, and, meet, or, exceed, the, old, high, voc, products, in, performance, and, cost, effectiveness, while, having, significantly, less, impact, on, human, and, environmental, health, globally, the, most, widely, accepted, standard, for, acceptable, levels, of, voc, in, paint, is, green, seal, s, gs, 11, standards, from, the, us, which, defines, different, voc, levels, acceptable, for, different, types, of, paint, based, on, use, case, and, performance, requirements, a, polychlorinated, biphenyl, pcb, was, reported, published, in, 2009, in, air, samples, collected, in, chicago, philadelphia, the, arctic, and, several, sites, around, the, great, lakes, pcb, is, a, global, pollutant, and, was, measured, in, the, wastewater, effluent, from, paint, production, the, widespread, distribution, of, pcb, suggests, volatilization, of, this, compound, from, surfaces, roofs, etc, pcb, is, present, in, consumer, goods, including, newspapers, magazines, and, cardboard, boxes, which, usually, contain, color, pigments, therefore, a, hypothesis, exists, that, pcb, congeners, are, present, as, byproduct, in, some, current, commercial, pigments, research, is, ongoing, to, remove, heavy, metals, from, paint, formulations, completely, the, ongoing, scrutiny, of, the, environmental, impact, of, plastics, in, paint, production, is, reminiscent, of, previous, investigations, into, the, use, of, lead, in, paints, this, assessment, is, driven, by, accumulating, evidence, that, underscores, the, role, of, paint, as, a, significant, contributor, to, microplastic, pollution, in, 2019, of, the, 44, 4, million, tons, of, globally, produced, paint, 95, percent, was, plastic, based, further, a, 2022, study, by, environmental, action, revealed, that, approximately, 58, percent, of, the, microplastics, found, in, oceans, and, waterways, could, be, traced, back, to, paint, efforts, to, mitigate, this, environmental, issue, have, spurred, the, development, and, exploration, of, alternatives, to, plastic, based, paints, such, as, those, derived, from, linseed, walnut, milk, and, limewash, however, their, cost, is, a, significant, deterrent, to, the, widespread, adoption, of, these, environmentally, friendly, alternatives, as, of, 2023, a, gallon, of, plastic, based, paint, may, cost, around, 20, to, 30, however, the, price, for, specialized, paint, such, as, graphene, and, lime, ranges, from, 34, to, 114, per, gallon, underlining, the, financial, challenges, associated, with, transitioning, from, plastic, based, paints
