wool, is, the, textile, fiber, obtained, from, sheep, and, other, mammals, especially, goats, rabbits, and, camelids, the, term, may, also, refer, to, inorganic, materials, such, as, mineral, wool, and, glass, wool, that, have, some, properties, similar, to, animal, wool, as, an, animal, fiber, wool, consists, of, protein, together, with, a, small, percentage, of, lipids, this, makes, it, chemically, quite, distinct, from, cotton, and, other, plant, fibers, which, are, mainly, cellulose, wool, is, produced, by, follicles, which, are, small, cells, located, in, the, skin, these, follicles, are, located, in, the, upper, layer, of, the, skin, called, the, epidermis, and, push, down, into, the, second, skin, layer, called, the, dermis, as, the, wool, fibers, grow, follicles, can, be, classed, as, either, primary, or, secondary, follicles, primary, follicles, produce, three, types, of, fiber, kemp, medullated, fibers, and, true, wool, fibers, secondary, follicles, only, produce, true, wool, fibers, medullated, fibers, share, nearly, identical, characteristics, to, hair, and, are, long, but, lack, crimp, and, elasticity, kemp, fibers, are, very, coarse, and, shed, out, wool, s, crimp, refers, to, the, strong, natural, wave, present, in, each, wool, fiber, as, it, is, presented, on, the, animal, wool, s, crimp, and, to, a, lesser, degree, scales, make, it, easier, to, spin, the, fleece, by, helping, the, individual, fibers, attach, so, they, stay, together, because, of, the, crimp, wool, fabrics, have, greater, bulk, than, other, textiles, and, they, hold, air, which, causes, the, fabric, to, retain, heat, wool, has, a, high, specific, thermal, resistance, so, it, impedes, heat, transfer, in, general, this, effect, has, benefited, desert, peoples, as, bedouins, and, tuaregs, use, wool, clothes, for, insulation, the, felting, of, wool, occurs, upon, hammering, or, other, mechanical, agitation, as, the, microscopic, barbs, on, the, surface, of, wool, fibers, hook, together, felting, generally, comes, under, two, main, areas, dry, felting, and, wet, felting, wet, felting, occurs, when, water, and, a, lubricant, especially, an, alkali, such, as, soap, are, applied, to, the, wool, which, is, then, agitated, until, the, fibers, mix, and, bond, together, temperature, shock, while, damp, or, wet, accentuates, the, felting, process, some, natural, felting, can, occur, on, the, animal, s, back, wool, has, several, qualities, that, distinguish, it, from, hair, or, fur, it, is, crimped, and, elastic, the, amount, of, crimp, corresponds, to, the, fineness, of, the, wool, fibers, a, fine, wool, like, merino, may, have, up, to, 40, crimps, per, centimetre, 100, crimps, per, inch, while, coarser, wool, like, karakul, may, have, less, than, one, one, or, two, crimps, per, inch, in, contrast, hair, has, little, if, any, scale, and, no, crimp, and, little, ability, to, bind, into, yarn, on, sheep, the, hair, part, of, the, fleece, is, called, kemp, the, relative, amounts, of, kemp, to, wool, vary, from, breed, to, breed, and, make, some, fleeces, more, desirable, for, spinning, felting, or, carding, into, batts, for, quilts, or, other, insulating, products, including, the, famous, tweed, cloth, of, scotland, wool, fibers, readily, absorb, moisture, but, are, not, hollow, wool, can, absorb, almost, one, third, of, its, own, weight, in, water, wool, absorbs, sound, like, many, other, fabrics, it, is, generally, a, creamy, white, color, although, some, breeds, of, sheep, produce, natural, colors, such, as, black, brown, silver, and, random, mixes, wool, ignites, at, a, higher, temperature, than, cotton, and, some, synthetic, fibers, it, has, a, lower, rate, of, flame, spread, a, lower, rate, of, heat, release, a, lower, heat, of, combustion, and, does, not, melt, or, drip, it, forms, a, char, that, is, insulating, and, self, extinguishing, and, it, contributes, less, to, toxic, gases, and, smoke, than, other, flooring, products, when, used, in, carpets, wool, carpets, are, specified, for, high, safety, environments, such, as, trains, and, aircraft, wool, is, usually, specified, for, garments, for, firefighters, soldiers, and, others, in, occupations, where, they, are, exposed, to, the, likelihood, of, fire, wool, causes, an, allergic, reaction, in, some, people, sheep, shearing, is, the, process, in, which, a, worker, a, shearer, cuts, off, the, woollen, fleece, of, a, sheep, after, shearing, wool, classers, separate, the, wool, into, four, main, categories, the, quality, of, fleeces, is, determined, by, a, technique, known, as, wool, classing, whereby, a, qualified, person, called, a, wool, classer, groups, wools, of, similar, grading, together, to, maximize, the, return, for, the, farmer, or, sheep, owner, in, australia, before, being, auctioned, all, merino, fleece, wool, is, objectively, measured, for, average, diameter, micron, yield, including, the, amount, of, vegetable, matter, staple, length, staple, strength, and, sometimes, color, and, comfort, factor, wool, straight, off, a, sheep, is, known, as, raw, wool, greasy, wool, or, wool, in, the, grease, this, wool, contains, a, high, level, of, valuable, lanolin, as, well, as, the, sheep, s, dead, skin, and, sweat, residue, and, generally, also, contains, pesticides, and, vegetable, matter, from, the, animal, s, environment, before, the, wool, can, be, used, for, commercial, purposes, it, must, be, scoured, a, process, of, cleaning, the, greasy, wool, scouring, may, be, as, simple, as, a, bath, in, warm, water, or, as, complicated, as, an, industrial, process, using, detergent, and, alkali, in, specialized, equipment, in, north, west, england, special, potash, pits, were, constructed, to, produce, potash, used, in, the, manufacture, of, a, soft, soap, for, scouring, locally, produced, white, wool, vegetable, matter, in, commercial, wool, is, often, removed, by, chemical, carbonization, in, less, processed, wools, vegetable, matter, may, be, removed, by, hand, and, some, of, the, lanolin, left, intact, through, the, use, of, gentler, detergents, this, semigrease, wool, can, be, worked, into, yarn, and, knitted, into, particularly, water, resistant, mittens, or, sweaters, such, as, those, of, the, aran, island, fishermen, lanolin, removed, from, wool, is, widely, used, in, cosmetic, products, such, as, hand, creams, raw, wool, has, many, impurities, vegetable, matter, sand, dirt, and, yolk, which, is, a, mixture, of, suint, sweat, grease, urine, stains, and, dung, locks, the, sheep, s, body, yields, many, types, of, wool, with, differing, strengths, thicknesses, length, of, staple, and, impurities, the, raw, wool, greasy, is, processed, into, top, worsted, top, requires, strong, straight, and, parallel, fibres, the, quality, of, wool, is, determined, by, its, fiber, diameter, crimp, yield, color, and, staple, strength, fiber, diameter, is, the, single, most, important, wool, characteristic, determining, quality, and, price, merino, wool, is, typically, 90, 115, mm, 3, 5, 4, 5, in, in, length, and, is, very, fine, between, 12, and, 24, microns, the, finest, and, most, valuable, wool, comes, from, merino, hoggets, wool, taken, from, sheep, produced, for, meat, is, typically, coarser, and, has, fibers, 40, 150, mm, 1, 5, 6, in, in, length, damage, or, breaks, in, the, wool, can, occur, if, the, sheep, is, stressed, while, it, is, growing, its, fleece, resulting, in, a, thin, spot, where, the, fleece, is, likely, to, break, wool, is, also, separated, into, grades, based, on, the, measurement, of, the, wool, s, diameter, in, microns, and, also, its, style, these, grades, may, vary, depending, on, the, breed, or, purpose, of, the, wool, for, example, any, wool, finer, than, 25, microns, can, be, used, for, garments, while, coarser, grades, are, used, for, outerwear, or, rugs, the, finer, the, wool, the, softer, it, is, while, coarser, grades, are, more, durable, and, less, prone, to, pilling, the, finest, australian, and, new, zealand, merino, wools, are, known, as, 1pp, which, is, the, industry, benchmark, of, excellence, for, merino, wool, 16, 9, microns, and, finer, this, style, represents, the, top, level, of, fineness, character, color, and, style, as, determined, on, the, basis, of, a, series, of, parameters, in, accordance, with, the, original, dictates, of, british, wool, as, applied, by, the, australian, wool, exchange, awex, council, only, a, few, dozen, of, the, millions, of, bales, auctioned, every, year, can, be, classified, and, marked, 1pp, in, the, united, states, three, classifications, of, wool, are, named, in, the, wool, products, labeling, act, of, 1939, wool, is, the, fiber, from, the, fleece, of, the, sheep, or, lamb, or, hair, of, the, angora, or, cashmere, goat, and, may, include, the, so, called, specialty, fibers, from, the, hair, of, the, camel, alpaca, llama, and, vicuna, which, has, never, been, reclaimed, from, any, woven, or, felted, wool, product, virgin, wool, and, new, wool, are, also, used, to, refer, to, such, never, used, wool, there, are, two, categories, of, recycled, wool, also, called, reclaimed, or, shoddy, wool, reprocessed, wool, identifies, wool, which, has, been, woven, or, felted, into, a, wool, product, and, subsequently, reduced, to, a, fibrous, state, without, having, been, used, by, the, ultimate, consumer, reused, wool, refers, to, such, wool, that, has, been, used, by, the, ultimate, consumer, wild, sheep, were, more, hairy, than, woolly, although, sheep, were, domesticated, some, 9, 000, to, 11, 000, years, ago, archaeological, evidence, from, statuary, found, at, sites, in, iran, suggests, selection, for, woolly, sheep, may, have, begun, around, 6000, bc, with, the, earliest, woven, wool, garments, having, only, been, dated, to, two, to, three, thousand, years, later, woolly, sheep, were, introduced, into, europe, from, the, near, east, in, the, early, part, of, the, 4th, millennium, bc, the, oldest, known, european, wool, textile, c, 1500, bc, was, preserved, in, a, danish, bog, prior, to, invention, of, shears, probably, in, the, iron, age, the, wool, was, plucked, out, by, hand, or, by, bronze, combs, in, roman, times, wool, linen, and, leather, clothed, the, european, population, cotton, from, india, was, a, curiosity, of, which, only, naturalists, had, heard, and, silks, imported, along, the, silk, road, from, china, were, extravagant, luxury, goods, pliny, the, elder, records, in, his, natural, history, that, the, reputation, for, producing, the, finest, wool, was, enjoyed, by, tarentum, where, selective, breeding, had, produced, sheep, with, superior, fleeces, but, which, required, special, care, in, medieval, times, as, trade, connections, expanded, the, champagne, fairs, revolved, around, the, production, of, wool, cloth, in, small, centers, such, as, provins, the, network, developed, by, the, annual, fairs, meant, the, woolens, of, provins, might, find, their, way, to, naples, sicily, cyprus, majorca, spain, and, even, constantinople, the, wool, trade, developed, into, serious, business, a, generator, of, capital, in, the, 13th, century, the, wool, trade, became, the, economic, engine, of, the, low, countries, and, central, italy, by, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, italy, predominated, the, florentine, wool, guild, arte, della, lana, sent, the, imported, english, wool, to, the, san, martino, convent, for, processing, italian, wool, from, abruzzo, and, spanish, merino, wools, were, processed, at, garbo, workshops, abruzzo, wool, had, once, been, the, most, accessible, for, the, florentine, guild, until, improved, relations, with, merchants, in, iberia, made, merino, wool, more, available, by, the, 16th, century, italian, wool, exports, to, the, levant, had, declined, eventually, replaced, by, silk, production, the, value, of, exports, of, english, raw, wool, were, rivaled, only, by, the, 15th, century, sheepwalks, of, castile, and, were, a, significant, source, of, income, to, the, english, crown, which, in, 1275, had, imposed, an, export, tax, on, wool, called, the, great, custom, the, importance, of, wool, to, the, english, economy, can, be, seen, in, the, fact, that, since, the, 14th, century, the, presiding, officer, of, the, house, of, lords, has, sat, on, the, woolsack, a, chair, stuffed, with, wool, economies, of, scale, were, instituted, in, the, cistercian, houses, which, had, accumulated, great, tracts, of, land, during, the, 12th, and, early, 13th, centuries, when, land, prices, were, low, and, labor, still, scarce, raw, wool, was, baled, and, shipped, from, north, sea, ports, to, the, textile, cities, of, flanders, notably, ypres, and, ghent, where, it, was, dyed, and, worked, up, as, cloth, at, the, time, of, the, black, death, english, textile, industries, consumed, about, 10, of, english, wool, production, the, english, textile, trade, grew, during, the, 15th, century, to, the, point, where, export, of, wool, was, discouraged, over, the, centuries, various, british, laws, controlled, the, wool, trade, or, required, the, use, of, wool, even, in, burials, the, smuggling, of, wool, out, of, the, country, known, as, owling, was, at, one, time, punishable, by, the, cutting, off, of, a, hand, after, the, restoration, fine, english, woolens, began, to, compete, with, silks, in, the, international, market, partly, aided, by, the, navigation, acts, in, 1699, the, english, crown, forbade, its, american, colonies, to, trade, wool, with, anyone, but, england, herself, a, great, deal, of, the, value, of, woollen, textiles, was, in, the, dyeing, and, finishing, of, the, woven, product, in, each, of, the, centers, of, the, textile, trade, the, manufacturing, process, came, to, be, subdivided, into, a, collection, of, trades, overseen, by, an, entrepreneur, in, a, system, called, by, the, english, the, putting, out, system, or, cottage, industry, and, the, verlagssystem, by, the, germans, in, this, system, of, producing, wool, cloth, once, perpetuated, in, the, production, of, harris, tweeds, the, entrepreneur, provides, the, raw, materials, and, an, advance, the, remainder, being, paid, upon, delivery, of, the, product, written, contracts, bound, the, artisans, to, specified, terms, fernand, braudel, traces, the, appearance, of, the, system, in, the, 13th, century, economic, boom, quoting, a, document, of, 1275, the, system, effectively, bypassed, the, guilds, restrictions, before, the, flowering, of, the, renaissance, the, medici, and, other, great, banking, houses, of, florence, had, built, their, wealth, and, banking, system, on, their, textile, industry, based, on, wool, overseen, by, the, arte, della, lana, the, wool, guild, wool, textile, interests, guided, florentine, policies, francesco, datini, the, merchant, of, prato, established, in, 1383, an, arte, della, lana, for, that, small, tuscan, city, the, sheepwalks, of, castile, were, controlled, by, the, mesta, union, of, sheep, owners, they, shaped, the, landscape, and, the, fortunes, of, the, meseta, that, lies, in, the, heart, of, the, iberian, peninsula, in, the, 16th, century, a, unified, spain, allowed, export, of, merino, lambs, only, with, royal, permission, the, german, wool, market, based, on, sheep, of, spanish, origin, did, not, overtake, british, wool, until, comparatively, late, later, the, industrial, revolution, introduced, mass, production, technology, into, wool, and, wool, cloth, manufacturing, australia, s, colonial, economy, was, based, on, sheep, raising, and, the, australian, wool, trade, eventually, overtook, that, of, the, germans, by, 1845, furnishing, wool, for, bradford, which, developed, as, the, heart, of, industrialized, woolens, production, due, to, decreasing, demand, with, increased, use, of, synthetic, fibers, wool, production, is, much, less, than, what, it, was, in, the, past, the, collapse, in, the, price, of, wool, began, in, late, 1966, with, a, 40, drop, with, occasional, interruptions, the, price, has, tended, down, the, result, has, been, sharply, reduced, production, and, movement, of, resources, into, production, of, other, commodities, in, the, case, of, sheep, growers, to, production, of, meat, superwash, wool, or, washable, wool, technology, first, appeared, in, the, early, 1970s, to, produce, wool, that, has, been, specially, treated, so, it, is, machine, washable, and, may, be, tumble, dried, this, wool, is, produced, using, an, acid, bath, that, removes, the, scales, from, the, fiber, or, by, coating, the, fiber, with, a, polymer, that, prevents, the, scales, from, attaching, to, each, other, and, causing, shrinkage, this, process, results, in, a, fiber, that, holds, longevity, and, durability, over, synthetic, materials, while, retaining, its, shape, in, december, 2004, a, bale, of, the, then, world, s, finest, wool, averaging, 11, 8, microns, sold, for, au, 3, 000, per, kilogram, at, auction, in, melbourne, this, fleece, wool, tested, with, an, average, yield, of, 74, 5, 68, mm, 2, 7, in, long, and, had, 40, newtons, per, kilotex, strength, the, result, was, a, 279, 000, for, the, bale, the, finest, bale, of, wool, ever, auctioned, was, sold, for, a, seasonal, record, of, au, 2690, per, kilo, during, june, 2008, this, bale, was, produced, by, the, hillcreston, pinehill, partnership, and, measured, 11, 6, microns, 72, 1, yield, and, had, a, 43, newtons, per, kilotex, strength, measurement, the, bale, realized, 247, 480, and, was, exported, to, india, in, 2007, a, new, wool, suit, was, developed, and, sold, in, japan, that, can, be, washed, in, the, shower, and, which, dries, off, ready, to, wear, within, hours, with, no, ironing, required, the, suit, was, developed, using, australian, merino, wool, and, it, enables, woven, products, made, from, wool, such, as, suits, trousers, and, skirts, to, be, cleaned, using, a, domestic, shower, at, home, in, december, 2006, the, general, assembly, of, the, united, nations, proclaimed, 2009, to, be, the, international, year, of, natural, fibres, so, as, to, raise, the, profile, of, wool, and, other, natural, fibers, global, wool, production, is, about, 2, million, tonnes, 2, 2, million, short, tons, per, year, of, which, 60, goes, into, apparel, wool, comprises, ca, 3, of, the, global, textile, market, but, its, value, is, higher, owing, to, dyeing, and, other, modifications, of, the, material, australia, is, a, leading, producer, of, wool, which, is, mostly, from, merino, sheep, but, has, been, eclipsed, by, china, in, terms, of, total, weight, new, zealand, 2016, is, the, third, largest, producer, of, wool, and, the, largest, producer, of, crossbred, wool, breeds, such, as, lincoln, romney, drysdale, and, elliotdale, produce, coarser, fibers,

and, much, of, it, comes, from, new, zealand, and, australia, organic, wool, has, become, easier, to, find, in, clothing, and, other, products, but, these, products, often, carry, a, higher, price, wool, is, environmentally, preferable, as, compared, to, petroleum, based, nylon, or, polypropylene, as, a, material, for, carpets, as, well, in, particular, when, combined, with, a, natural, binding, and, the, use, of, formaldehyde, free, glues, animal, rights, groups, have, noted, issues, with, the, production, of, wool, such, as, mulesing, about, 85, of, wool, sold, in, australia, is, sold, by, open, cry, auction, the, british, wool, marketing, board, operates, a, central, marketing, system, for, uk, fleece, wool, with, the, aim, of, achieving, the, best, possible, net, returns, for, farmers, less, than, half, of, new, zealand, s, wool, is, sold, at, auction, while, around, 45, of, farmers, sell, wool, directly, to, private, buyers, and, end, users, united, states, sheep, producers, market, wool, with, private, or, cooperative, wool, warehouses, but, wool, pools, are, common, in, many, states, in, some, cases, wool, is, pooled, in, a, local, market, area, but, sold, through, a, wool, warehouse, wool, offered, with, objective, measurement, test, results, is, preferred, imported, apparel, wool, and, carpet, wool, goes, directly, to, central, markets, where, it, is, handled, by, the, large, merchants, and, manufacturers, shoddy, or, recycled, wool, is, made, by, cutting, or, tearing, apart, existing, wool, fabric, and, respinning, the, resulting, fibers, as, this, process, makes, the, wool, fibers, shorter, the, remanufactured, fabric, is, inferior, to, the, original, the, recycled, wool, may, be, mixed, with, raw, wool, wool, noil, or, another, fiber, such, as, cotton, to, increase, the, average, fiber, length, such, yarns, are, typically, used, as, weft, yarns, with, a, cotton, warp, this, process, was, invented, in, the, heavy, woollen, district, of, west, yorkshire, and, created, a, microeconomy, in, this, area, for, many, years, worsted, is, a, strong, long, staple, combed, wool, yarn, with, a, hard, surface, woolen, is, a, soft, short,

strength, on, the, loom, in, addition, to, clothing, wool, has, been, used, for, blankets, suits, horse, rugs, saddle, cloths, carpeting, insulation, and, upholstery, dyed, wool, can, be, used, to, create, other, forms, of, art, such, as, wet, and, needle, felting, wool, felt, covers, piano, hammers, and, it, is, used, to, absorb, odors, and, noise, in, heavy, machinery, and, stereo, speakers, ancient, greeks, lined, their, helmets, with, felt, and, roman, legionnaires, used, breastplates, made, of, wool, felt, wool, as, well, as, cotton, has, also, been, traditionally, used, for, cloth, diapers, wool, fiber, exteriors, are, hydrophobic, repel, water, and, the, interior, of, the, wool, fiber, is, hygroscopic, attracts, water, this, makes, a, wool, garment, suitable, cover, for, a, wet, diaper, by, inhibiting, wicking, so, outer, garments, remain, dry, wool, felted, and, treated, with, lanolin, is, water, resistant, air, permeable, and, slightly, antibacterial, so, it, resists, the, buildup, of, odor, some, modern, cloth, diapers, use, felted, wool, fabric, for, covers, and, there, are, several, modern, commercial, knitting, patterns, for, wool, diaper, covers, initial, studies, of, woollen, underwear, have, found, it, prevented, heat, and, sweat, rashes, because, it, more, readily, absorbs, the, moisture, than, other, fibers, as, an, animal, protein, wool, can, be, used, as, a, soil, fertilizer, being, a, slow, release, source, of, nitrogen, researchers, at, the, royal, melbourne, institute, of, technology, school, of, fashion, and, textiles, have, discovered, a, blend, of, wool, and, kevlar, the, synthetic, fiber, widely, used, in, body, armor, was, lighter, cheaper, and, worked, better, in, damp, conditions, than, kevlar, alone, kevlar, when, used, alone, loses, about, 20, of, its, effectiveness, when, wet, so, required, an, expensive, waterproofing, process, wool, increased, friction, in, a, vest, with, 28, 30, layers, of, fabric, to, provide, the, same, level, of, bullet, resistance, as, 36, layers, of, kevlar, alone, a, buyer, of, merino, wool, ermenegildo, zegna, has, offered, awards, for, australian, wool, producers, in, 1963, the, first, ermenegildo, zegna, perpetual, trophy, was, presented, in, tasmania, for, growers, of, superfine, skirted, merino, fleece, in, 1980, a, national, award, the, ermenegildo, zegna, trophy, for, extrafine, wool, production, was, launched, in, 2004, this, award, became, known, as, the, ermenegildo, zegna, unprotected, wool, trophy, in, 1998, an, ermenegildo, zegna, protected, wool, trophy, was, launched, for, fleece, from, sheep, coated, for, around, nine, months, of, the, year, in, 2002, the, ermenegildo, zegna, vellus, aureum, trophy, was, launched, for, wool, that, is, 13, 9, microns, or, finer, wool, from, australia, new, zealand, argentina, and, south, africa, may, enter, and, a, winner, is, named, from, each, country, in, april, 2008, new, zealand, won, the, ermenegildo, zegna, vellus, aureum, trophy, for, the, first, time, with, a, fleece, that, measured, 10, 8, microns, this, contest, awards, the, winning, fleece, weight, with, the, same, weight, in,
