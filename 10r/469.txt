video, is, an, electronic, medium, for, the, recording, copying, playback, broadcasting, and, display, of, moving, visual, media, video, was, first, developed, for, mechanical, television, systems, which, were, quickly, replaced, by, cathode, ray, tube, crt, systems, which, in, turn, were, replaced, by, flat, panel, displays, of, several, types, video, systems, vary, in, display, resolution, aspect, ratio, refresh, rate, color, capabilities, and, other, qualities, analog, and, digital, variants, exist, and, can, be, carried, on, a, variety, of, media, including, radio, broadcasts, magnetic, tape, optical, discs, computer, files, and, network, streaming, the, word, video, comes, from, the, latin, video, i, see, video, developed, from, facsimile, systems, developed, in, the, mid, 19th, century, early, mechanical, video, scanners, such, as, the, nipkow, disk, were, patented, as, early, as, 1884, however, it, took, several, decades, before, practical, video, systems, could, be, developed, many, decades, after, film, film, records, using, a, sequence, of, miniature, photographic, images, visible, to, the, eye, when, the, film, is, physically, examined, video, by, contrast, encodes, images, electronically, turning, the, images, into, analog, or, digital, electronic, signals, for, transmission, or, recording, video, technology, was, first, developed, for, mechanical, television, systems, which, were, quickly, replaced, by, cathode, ray, tube, crt, television, systems, video, was, originally, exclusively, live, technology, live, video, cameras, used, an, electron, beam, which, would, scan, a, photoconductive, plate, with, the, desired, image, and, produce, a, voltage, signal, proportional, to, the, brightness, in, each, part, of, the, image, the, signal, could, then, be, sent, to, televisions, where, another, beam, would, receive, and, display, the, image, charles, ginsburg, led, an, ampex, research, team, to, develop, one, of, the, first, practical, video, tape, recorders, vtr, in, 1951, the, first, vtr, captured, live, images, from, television, cameras, by, writing, the, camera, s, electrical, signal, onto, magnetic, videotape, video, recorders, were, sold, for, us, 50, 000, in, 1956, and, videotapes, cost, us, 300, per, one, hour, reel, however, prices, gradually, dropped, over, the, years, in, 1971, sony, began, selling, videocassette, recorder, vcr, decks, and, tapes, into, the, consumer, market, digital, video, is, capable, of, higher, quality, and, eventually, a, much, lower, cost, than, earlier, analog, technology, after, the, commercial, introduction, of, the, dvd, in, 1997, and, later, the, blu, ray, disc, in, 2006, sales, of, videotape, and, recording, equipment, plummeted, advances, in, computer, technology, allow, even, inexpensive, personal, computers, and, smartphones, to, capture, store, edit, and, transmit, digital, video, further, reducing, the, cost, of, video, production, and, allowing, program, makers, and, broadcasters, to, move, to, tapeless, production, the, advent, of, digital, broadcasting, and, the, subsequent, digital, television, transition, are, in, the, process, of, relegating, analog, video, to, the, status, of, a, legacy, technology, in, most, parts, of, the, world, the, development, of, high, resolution, video, cameras, with, improved, dynamic, range, and, color, gamuts, along, with, the, introduction, of, high, dynamic, range, digital, intermediate, data, formats, with, improved, color, depth, has, caused, digital, video, technology, to, converge, with, film, technology, since, 2013, the, use, of, digital, cameras, in, hollywood, has, surpassed, the, use, of, film, cameras, frame, rate, the, number, of, still, pictures, per, unit, of, time, of, video, ranges, from, six, or, eight, frames, per, second, frame, s, for, old, mechanical, cameras, to, 120, or, more, frames, per, second, for, new, professional, cameras, pal, standards, europe, asia, australia, etc, and, secam, france, russia, parts, of, africa, etc, specify, 25, frame, s, while, ntsc, standards, united, states, canada, japan, etc, specify, 29, 97, frame, s, film, is, shot, at, a, slower, frame, rate, of, 24, frames, per, second, which, slightly, complicates, the, process, of, transferring, a, cinematic, motion, picture, to, video, the, minimum, frame, rate, to, achieve, a, comfortable, illusion, of, a, moving, image, is, about, sixteen, frames, per, second, video, can, be, interlaced, or, progressive, in, progressive, scan, systems, each, refresh, period, updates, all, scan, lines, in, each, frame, in, sequence, when, displaying, a, natively, progressive, broadcast, or, recorded, signal, the, result, is, the, optimum, spatial, resolution, of, both, the, stationary, and, moving, parts, of, the, image, interlacing, was, invented, as, a, way, to, reduce, flicker, in, early, mechanical, and, crt, video, displays, without, increasing, the, number, of, complete, frames, per, second, interlacing, retains, detail, while, requiring, lower, bandwidth, compared, to, progressive, scanning, in, interlaced, video, the, horizontal, scan, lines, of, each, complete, frame, are, treated, as, if, numbered, consecutively, and, captured, as, two, fields, an, odd, field, upper, field, consisting, of, the, odd, numbered, lines, and, an, even, field, lower, field, consisting, of, the, even, numbered, lines, analog, display, devices, reproduce, each, frame, effectively, doubling, the, frame, rate, as, far, as, perceptible, overall, flicker, is, concerned, when, the, image, capture, device, acquires, the, fields, one, at, a, time, rather, than, dividing, up, a, complete, frame, after, it, is, captured, the, frame, rate, for, motion, is, effectively, doubled, as, well, resulting, in, smoother, more, lifelike, reproduction, of, rapidly, moving, parts, of, the, image, when, viewed, on, an, interlaced, crt, display, ntsc, pal, and, secam, are, interlaced, formats, abbreviated, video, resolution, specifications, often, include, an, i, to, indicate, interlacing, for, example, pal, video, format, is, often, described, as, 576i50, where, 576, indicates, the, total, number, of, horizontal, scan, lines, i, indicates, interlacing, and, 50, indicates, 50, fields, half, frames, per, second, when, displaying, a, natively, interlaced, signal, on, a, progressive, scan, device, the, overall, spatial, resolution, is, degraded, by, simple, line, doubling, artifacts, such, as, flickering, or, comb, effects, in, moving, parts, of, the, image, that, appear, unless, special, signal, processing, eliminates, them, a, procedure, known, as, deinterlacing, can, optimize, the, display, of, an, interlaced, video, signal, from, an, analog, dvd, or, satellite, source, on, a, progressive, scan, device, such, as, an, lcd, television, digital, video, projector, or, plasma, panel, deinterlacing, cannot, however, produce, video, quality, that, is, equivalent, to, true, progressive, scan, source, material, aspect, ratio, describes, the, proportional, relationship, between, the, width, and, height, of, video, screens, and, video, picture, elements, all, popular, video, formats, are, rectangular, and, this, can, be, described, by, a, ratio, between, width, and, height, the, ratio, of, width, to, height, for, a, traditional, television, screen, is, 4, 3, or, about, 1, 33, 1, high, definition, televisions, use, an, aspect, ratio, of, 16, 9, or, about, 1, 78, 1, the, aspect, ratio, of, a, full, 35, mm, film, frame, with, soundtrack, also, known, as, the, academy, ratio, is, 1, 375, 1, pixels, on, computer, monitors, are, usually, square, but, pixels, used, in, digital, video, often, have, non, square, aspect, ratios, such, as, those, used, in, the, pal, and, ntsc, variants, of, the, ccir, 601, digital, video, standard, and, the, corresponding, anamorphic, widescreen, formats, the, 720, by, 480, pixel, raster, uses, thin, pixels, on, a, 4, 3, aspect, ratio, display, and, fat, pixels, on, a, 16, 9, display, the, popularity, of, viewing, video, on, mobile, phones, has, led, to, the, growth, of, vertical, video, mary, meeker, a, partner, at, silicon, valley, venture, capital, firm, kleiner, perkins, caufield, byers, highlighted, the, growth, of, vertical, video, viewing, in, her, 2015, internet, trends, report, growing, from, 5, of, video, viewing, in, 2010, to, 29, in, 2015, vertical, video, ads, like, snapchat, s, are, watched, in, their, entirety, nine, times, more, frequently, than, landscape, video, ads, the, color, model, uses, the, video, color, representation, and, maps, encoded, color, values, to, visible, colors, reproduced, by, the, system, there, are, several, such, representations, in, common, use, typically, yiq, is, used, in, ntsc, television, yuv, is, used, in, pal, television, ydbdr, is, used, by, secam, television, and, ycbcr, is, used, for, digital, video, the, number, of, distinct, colors, a, pixel, can, represent, depends, on, the, color, depth, expressed, in, the, number, of, bits, per, pixel, a, common, way, to, reduce, the, amount, of, data, required, in, digital, video, is, by, chroma, subsampling, e, g, 4, 4, 4, 4, 2, 2, etc, because, the, human, eye, is, less, sensitive, to, details, in, color, than, brightness, the, luminance, data, for, all, pixels, is, maintained, while, the, chrominance, data, is, averaged, for, a, number, of, pixels, in, a, block, and, the, same, value, is, used, for, all, of, them, for, example, this, results, in, a, 50, reduction, in, chrominance, data, using, 2, pixel, blocks, 4, 2, 2, or, 75, using, 4, pixel, blocks, 4, 2, 0, this, process, does, not, reduce, the, number, of, possible, color, values, that, can, be, displayed, but, it, reduces, the, number, of, distinct, points, at, which, the, color, changes, video, quality, can, be, measured, with, formal, metrics, like, peak, signal, to, noise, ratio, psnr, or, through, subjective, video, quality, assessment, using, expert, observation, many, subjective, video, quality, methods, are, described, in, the, itu, t, recommendation, bt, 500, one, of, the, standardized, methods, is, the, double, stimulus, impairment, scale, dsis, in, dsis, each, expert, views, an, unimpaired, reference, video, followed, by, an, impaired, version, of, the, same, video, the, expert, then, rates, the, impaired, video, using, a, scale, ranging, from, impairments, are, imperceptible, to, impairments, are, very, annoying, uncompressed, video, delivers, maximum, quality, but, at, a, very, high, data, rate, a, variety, of, methods, are, used, to, compress, video, streams, with, the, most, effective, ones, using, a, group, of, pictures, gop, to, reduce, spatial, and, temporal, redundancy, broadly, speaking, spatial, redundancy, is, reduced, by, registering, differences, between, parts, of, a, single, frame, this, task, is, known, as, intraframe, compression, and, is, closely, related, to, image, compression, likewise, temporal, redundancy, can, be, reduced, by, registering, differences, between, frames, this, task, is, known, as, interframe, compression, including, motion, compensation, and, other, techniques, the, most, common, modern, compression, standards, are, mpeg, 2, used, for, dvd, blu, ray, and, satellite, television, and, mpeg, 4, used, for, avchd, mobile, phones, 3gp, and, the, internet, stereoscopic, video, for, 3d, film, and, other, applications, can, be, displayed, using, several, different, methods, different, layers, of, video, transmission, and, storage, each, provide, their, own, set, of, formats, to, choose, from, for, transmission, there, is, a, physical, connector, and, signal, protocol, see, list, of, video, connectors, a, given, physical, link, can, carry, certain, display, standards, that, specify, a, particular, refresh, rate, display, resolution, and, color, space, many, analog, and, digital, recording, formats, are, in, use, and, digital, video, clips, can, also, be, stored, on, a, computer, file, system, as, files, which, have, their, own, formats, in, addition, to, the, physical, format, used, by, the, data, storage, device, or, transmission, medium, the, stream, of, ones, and, zeros, that, is, sent, must, be, in, a, particular, digital, video, coding, format, for, which, a, number, is, available, analog, video, is, a, video, signal, represented, by, one, or, more, analog, signals, analog, color, video, signals, include, luminance, y, and, chrominance, c, when, combined, into, one, channel, as, is, the, case, among, others, with, ntsc, pal, and, secam, it, is, called, composite, video, analog, video, may, be, carried, in, separate, channels, as, in, two, channel, s, video, yc, and, multi, channel, component, video, formats, analog, video, is, used, in, both, consumer, and, professional, television, production, applications, digital, video, signal, formats, have, been, adopted, including, serial, digital, interface, sdi, digital, visual, interface, dvi, high, definition, multimedia, interface, hdmi, and, displayport, interface, video, can, be, transmitted, or, transported, in, a, variety, of, ways, including, wireless, terrestrial, television, as, an, analog, or, digital, signal, coaxial, cable, in, a, closed, circuit, system, as, an, analog, signal, broadcast, or, studio, cameras, use, a, single, or, dual, coaxial, cable, system, using, serial, digital, interface, sdi, see, list, of, video, connectors, for, information, about, physical, connectors, and, related, signal, standards, video, may, be, transported, over, networks, and, other, shared, digital, communications, links, using, for, instance, mpeg, transport, stream, smpte, 2022, and, smpte, 2110, digital, television, broadcasts, use, the, mpeg, 2, and, other, video, coding, formats, and, include, analog, television, broadcast, standards, include, an, analog, video, format, consists, of, more, information, than, the, visible, content, of, the, frame, preceding, and, following, the, image, are, lines, and, pixels, containing, metadata, and, synchronization, information, this, surrounding, margin, is, known, as, a, blanking, interval, or, blanking, region, the, horizontal, and, vertical, front, porch, and, back, porch, are, the, building, blocks, of, the, blanking, interval, computer, display, standards, specify, a, combination, of, aspect, ratio, display, size, display, resolution, color, depth, and, refresh, rate, a, list, of, common, resolutions, is, available, early, television, was, almost, exclusively, a, live, medium, with, some, programs, recorded, to, film, for, historical, purposes, using, kinescope, the, analog, video, tape, recorder, was, commercially, introduced, in, 1951, the, following, list, is, in, rough, chronological, order, all, formats, listed, were, sold, to, and, used, by, broadcasters, video, producers, or, consumers, or, were, important, historically, digital, video, tape, recorders, offered, improved, quality, compared, to, analog, recorders, optical, storage, mediums, offered, an, alternative, especially, in, consumer, applications, to, bulky, tape, formats, a, video, codec, is, software, or, hardware, that, compresses, and, decompresses, digital, video, in, the, context, of, video, compression, codec, is, a, portmanteau, of, encoder, and, decoder, while, a, device, that, only, compresses, is, typically, called, an, encoder, and, one, that, only, decompresses, is, a, decoder, the, compressed, data, format, usually, conforms, to, a, standard, video, coding, format, the, compression, is, typically, lossy, meaning, that, the, compressed, video, lacks, some, information, present, in, the, original, video, a, consequence, of, this, is, that, decompressed, video, has, lower, quality, than, the, original, uncompressed, video, because, there, is, insufficient, information, to, accurately, reconstruct, the, original, video
