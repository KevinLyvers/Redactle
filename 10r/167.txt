an, assembly, line, often, called, progressive, assembly, is, a, manufacturing, process, where, the, unfinished, product, moves, in, a, direct, line, from, workstation, to, workstation, with, parts, added, in, sequence, until, the, final, product, is, completed, by, mechanically, moving, parts, to, workstations, and, transferring, the, unfinished, product, from, one, workstation, to, another, a, finished, product, can, be, assembled, faster, and, with, less, labor, than, having, workers, carry, parts, to, a, stationary, product, assembly, lines, are, common, methods, of, assembling, complex, items, such, as, automobiles, and, other, transportation, equipment, household, appliances, and, electronic, goods, workers, in, charge, of, the, works, of, assembly, line, are, called, assemblers, assembly, lines, are, designed, for, the, sequential, organization, of, workers, tools, or, machines, and, parts, the, motion, of, workers, is, minimized, to, the, extent, possible, all, parts, or, assemblies, are, handled, either, by, conveyors, or, motorized, vehicles, such, as, forklifts, or, gravity, with, no, manual, trucking, heavy, lifting, is, done, by, machines, such, as, overhead, cranes, or, forklifts, each, worker, typically, performs, one, simple, operation, unless, job, rotation, strategies, are, applied, according, to, henry, ford, the, principles, of, assembly, are, these, 1, place, the, tools, and, the, men, in, the, sequence, of, the, operation, so, that, each, component, part, shall, travel, the, least, possible, distance, while, in, the, process, of, finishing, 2, use, work, slides, or, some, other, form, of, the, carrier, so, that, when, a, workman, completes, his, operation, he, drops, the, part, always, in, the, same, place, which, place, must, always, be, the, most, convenient, place, to, his, hand, and, if, possible, have, gravity, carry, the, part, to, the, next, workman, for, his, own, 3, use, sliding, assembling, lines, by, which, the, parts, to, be, assembled, are, delivered, at, convenient, distances, designing, assembly, lines, is, a, well, established, mathematical, challenge, referred, to, as, an, assembly, line, balancing, problem, in, the, simple, assembly, line, balancing, problem, the, aim, is, to, assign, a, set, of, tasks, that, need, to, be, performed, on, the, workpiece, to, a, sequence, of, workstations, each, task, requires, a, given, task, duration, for, completion, the, assignment, of, tasks, to, stations, is, typically, limited, by, two, constraints, 1, a, precedence, graph, which, indicates, what, other, tasks, need, to, be, completed, before, a, particular, task, can, be, initiated, e, g, not, putting, in, a, screw, before, drilling, the, hole, and, 2, a, cycle, time, which, restricts, the, sum, of, task, processing, times, which, can, be, completed, at, each, workstation, before, the, work, piece, is, moved, to, the, next, station, by, the, conveyor, belt, major, planning, problems, for, operating, assembly, lines, include, supply, chain, integration, inventory, control, and, production, scheduling, consider, the, assembly, of, a, car, assume, that, certain, steps, in, the, assembly, line, are, to, install, the, engine, install, the, hood, and, install, the, wheels, in, that, order, with, arbitrary, interstitial, steps, only, one, of, these, steps, can, be, done, at, a, time, in, traditional, production, only, one, car, would, be, assembled, at, a, time, if, engine, installation, takes, 20, minutes, hood, installation, takes, five, minutes, and, wheels, installation, takes, 10, minutes, then, a, car, can, be, produced, every, 35, minutes, in, an, assembly, line, car, assembly, is, split, between, several, stations, all, working, simultaneously, when, a, station, is, finished, with, a, car, it, passes, it, on, to, the, next, by, having, three, stations, three, cars, can, be, operated, on, at, the, same, time, each, at, a, different, stage, of, assembly, after, finishing, its, work, on, the, first, car, the, engine, installation, crew, can, begin, working, on, the, second, car, while, the, engine, installation, crew, works, on, the, second, car, the, first, car, can, be, moved, to, the, hood, station, and, fitted, with, a, hood, then, to, the, wheels, station, and, be, fitted, with, wheels, after, the, engine, has, been, installed, on, the, second, car, the, second, car, moves, to, the, hood, assembly, at, the, same, time, the, third, car, moves, to, the, engine, assembly, when, the, third, car, s, engine, has, been, mounted, it, then, can, be, moved, to, the, hood, station, meanwhile, subsequent, cars, if, any, can, be, moved, to, the, engine, installation, station, assuming, no, loss, of, time, when, moving, a, car, from, one, station, to, another, the, longest, stage, on, the, assembly, line, determines, the, throughput, 20, minutes, for, the, engine, installation, so, a, car, can, be, produced, every, 20, minutes, once, the, first, car, taking, 35, minutes, has, been, produced, before, the, industrial, revolution, most, manufactured, products, were, made, individually, by, hand, a, single, craftsman, or, team, of, craftsmen, would, create, each, part, of, a, product, they, would, use, their, skills, and, tools, such, as, files, and, knives, to, create, the, individual, parts, they, would, then, assemble, them, into, the, final, product, making, cut, and, try, changes, in, the, parts, until, they, fit, and, could, work, together, craft, production, division, of, labor, was, practiced, by, ancient, greeks, chinese, and, other, ancient, civilizations, in, ancient, greece, it, was, discussed, by, plato, and, xenophon, adam, smith, discussed, the, division, of, labour, in, the, manufacture, of, pins, at, length, in, his, book, the, wealth, of, nations, published, in, 1776, the, venetian, arsenal, dating, to, about, 1104, operated, similar, to, a, production, line, ships, moved, down, a, canal, and, were, fitted, by, the, various, shops, they, passed, at, the, peak, of, its, efficiency, in, the, early, 16th, century, the, arsenal, employed, some, 16, 000, people, who, could, apparently, produce, nearly, one, ship, each, day, and, could, fit, out, arm, and, provision, a, newly, built, galley, with, standardized, parts, on, an, assembly, line, basis, although, the, arsenal, lasted, until, the, early, industrial, revolution, production, line, methods, did, not, become, common, even, then, the, industrial, revolution, led, to, a, proliferation, of, manufacturing, and, invention, many, industries, notably, textiles, firearms, clocks, and, watches, horse, drawn, vehicles, railway, locomotives, sewing, machines, and, bicycles, saw, expeditious, improvement, in, materials, handling, machining, and, assembly, during, the, 19th, century, although, modern, concepts, such, as, industrial, engineering, and, logistics, had, not, yet, been, named, the, automatic, flour, mill, built, by, oliver, evans, in, 1785, was, called, the, beginning, of, modern, bulk, material, handling, by, roe, 1916, evans, s, mill, used, a, leather, belt, bucket, elevator, screw, conveyors, canvas, belt, conveyors, and, other, mechanical, devices, to, completely, automate, the, process, of, making, flour, the, innovation, spread, to, other, mills, and, breweries, probably, the, earliest, industrial, example, of, a, linear, and, continuous, assembly, process, is, the, portsmouth, block, mills, built, between, 1801, and, 1803, marc, isambard, brunel, father, of, isambard, kingdom, brunel, with, the, help, of, henry, maudslay, and, others, designed, 22, types, of, machine, tools, to, make, the, parts, for, the, rigging, blocks, used, by, the, royal, navy, this, factory, was, so, successful, that, it, remained, in, use, until, the, 1960s, with, the, workshop, still, visible, at, hm, dockyard, in, portsmouth, and, still, containing, some, of, the, original, machinery, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, an, almost, modern, factory, layout, designed, for, easy, material, handling, was, the, bridgewater, foundry, the, factory, grounds, were, bordered, by, the, bridgewater, canal, and, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, the, buildings, were, arranged, in, a, line, with, a, railway, for, carrying, the, work, going, through, the, buildings, cranes, were, used, for, lifting, the, heavy, work, which, sometimes, weighed, in, the, tens, of, tons, the, work, passed, sequentially, through, to, erection, of, framework, and, final, assembly, the, first, flow, assembly, line, was, initiated, at, the, factory, of, richard, garrett, sons, leiston, works, in, leiston, in, the, english, county, of, suffolk, for, the, manufacture, of, portable, steam, engines, the, assembly, line, area, was, called, the, long, shop, on, account, of, its, length, and, was, fully, operational, by, early, 1853, the, boiler, was, brought, up, from, the, foundry, and, put, at, the, start, of, the, line, and, as, it, progressed, through, the, building, it, would, stop, at, various, stages, where, new, parts, would, be, added, from, the, upper, level, where, other, parts, were, made, the, lighter, parts, would, be, lowered, over, a, balcony, and, then, fixed, onto, the, machine, on, the, ground, level, when, the, machine, reached, the, end, of, the, shop, it, would, be, completed, during, the, early, 19th, century, the, development, of, machine, tools, such, as, the, screw, cutting, lathe, metal, planer, and, milling, machine, and, of, toolpath, control, via, jigs, and, fixtures, provided, the, prerequisites, for, the, modern, assembly, line, by, making, interchangeable, parts, a, practical, reality, steam, powered, conveyor, lifts, began, being, used, for, loading, and, unloading, ships, some, time, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, hounshell, 1984, shows, a, c, 1885, sketch, of, an, electric, powered, conveyor, moving, cans, through, a, filling, line, in, a, canning, factory, the, meatpacking, industry, of, chicago, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, first, industrial, assembly, lines, or, disassembly, lines, to, be, utilized, in, the, united, states, starting, in, 1867, workers, would, stand, at, fixed, stations, and, a, pulley, system, would, bring, the, meat, to, each, worker, and, they, would, complete, one, task, henry, ford, and, others, have, written, about, the, influence, of, this, slaughterhouse, practice, on, the, later, developments, at, ford, motor, company, according, to, domm, the, implementation, of, mass, production, of, an, automobile, via, an, assembly, line, may, be, credited, to, ransom, olds, who, used, it, to, build, the, first, mass, produced, automobile, the, oldsmobile, curved, dash, olds, patented, the, assembly, line, concept, which, he, put, to, work, in, his, olds, motor, vehicle, company, factory, in, 1901, at, ford, motor, company, the, assembly, line, was, introduced, by, william, pa, klann, upon, his, return, from, visiting, swift, company, s, slaughterhouse, in, chicago, and, viewing, what, was, referred, to, as, the, disassembly, line, where, carcasses, were, butchered, as, they, moved, along, a, conveyor, the, efficiency, of, one, person, removing, the, same, piece, over, and, over, without, moving, to, another, station, caught, his, attention, he, reported, the, idea, to, peter, e, martin, soon, to, be, head, of, ford, production, who, was, doubtful, at, the, time, but, encouraged, him, to, proceed, others, at, ford, have, claimed, to, have, put, the, idea, forth, to, henry, ford, but, pa, klann, s, slaughterhouse, revelation, is, well, documented, in, the, archives, at, the, henry, ford, museum, and, elsewhere, making, him, an, important, contributor, to, the, modern, automated, assembly, line, concept, ford, was, appreciative, having, visited, the, highly, automated, 40, acre, sears, mail, order, handling, facility, around, 1906, at, ford, the, process, was, an, evolution, by, trial, and, error, of, a, team, consisting, primarily, of, peter, e, martin, the, factory, superintendent, charles, e, sorensen, martin, s, assistant, clarence, w, avery, c, harold, wills, draftsman, and, toolmaker, charles, ebender, and, j, zsef, galamb, some, of, the, groundwork, for, such, development, had, recently, been, laid, by, the, intelligent, layout, of, machine, tool, placement, that, walter, flanders, had, been, doing, at, ford, up, to, 1908, the, moving, assembly, line, was, developed, for, the, ford, model, t, and, began, operation, on, october, 7, 1913, at, the, highland, park, ford, plant, and, continued, to, evolve, after, that, using, time, and, motion, study, the, assembly, line, driven, by, conveyor, belts, reduced, production, time, for, a, model, t, to, just, 93, minutes, by, dividing, the, process, into, 45, steps, producing, cars, quicker, than, paint, of, the, day, could, dry, it, had, an, immense, influence, on, the, world, in, 1922, ford, through, his, ghostwriter, crowther, said, of, his, 1913, assembly, line, i, believe, that, this, was, the, first, moving, line, ever, installed, the, idea, came, in, a, general, way, from, the, overhead, trolley, that, the, chicago, packers, use, in, dressing, beef, charles, e, sorensen, in, his, 1956, memoir, my, forty, years, with, ford, presented, a, different, version, of, development, that, was, not, so, much, about, individual, inventors, as, a, gradual, logical, development, of, industrial, engineering, what, was, worked, out, at, ford, was, the, practice, of, moving, the, work, from, one, worker, to, another, until, it, became, a, complete, unit, then, arranging, the, flow, of, these, units, at, the, right, time, and, the, right, place, to, a, moving, final, assembly, line, from, which, came, a, finished, product, regardless, of, earlier, uses, of, some, of, these, principles, the, direct, line, of, succession, of, mass, production, and, its, intensification, into, automation, stems, directly, from, what, we, worked, out, at, ford, motor, company, between, 1908, and, 1913, henry, ford, is, generally, regarded, as, the, father, of, mass, production, he, was, not, he, was, the, sponsor, of, it, as, a, result, of, these, developments, in, method, ford, s, cars, came, off, the, line, in, three, minute, intervals, or, six, feet, per, minute, this, was, much, faster, than, previous, methods, increasing, production, by, eight, to, one, requiring, 12, 5, man, hours, before, 1, hour, 33, minutes, after, while, using, less, manpower, it, was, so, successful, paint, became, a, bottleneck, only, japan, black, would, dry, fast, enough, forcing, the, company, to, drop, the, variety, of, colours, available, before, 1914, until, fast, drying, duco, lacquer, was, developed, in, 1926, the, assembly, line, technique, was, an, integral, part, of, the, diffusion, of, the, automobile, into, american, society, decreased, costs, of, production, allowed, the, cost, of, the, model, t, to, fall, within, the, budget, of, the, american, middle, class, in, 1908, the, price, of, a, model, t, was, around, 825, and, by, 1912, it, had, decreased, to, around, 575, this, price, reduction, is, comparable, to, a, reduction, from, 15, 000, to, 10, 000, in, dollar, terms, from, the, year, 2000, in, 1914, an, assembly, line, worker, could, buy, a, model, t, with, four, months, pay, ford, s, complex, safety, procedures, especially, assigning, each, worker, to, a, specific, location, instead, of, allowing, them, to, roam, about, dramatically, reduced, the, rate, of, injury, the, combination, of, high, wages, and, high, efficiency, is, called, fordism, and, was, copied, by, most, major, industries, the, efficiency, gains, from, the, assembly, line, also, coincided, with, the, take, off, of, the, united, states, the, assembly, line, forced, workers, to, work, at, a, certain, pace, with, very, repetitive, motions, which, led, to, more, output, per, worker, while, other, countries, were, using, less, productive, methods, in, the, automotive, industry, its, success, was, dominating, and, quickly, spread, worldwide, ford, france, and, ford, britain, in, 1911, ford, denmark, 1923, ford, germany, and, ford, japan, 1925, in, 1919, vulcan, southport, lancashire, was, the, first, native, european, manufacturer, to, adopt, it, soon, companies, had, to, have, assembly, lines, or, risk, going, broke, by, not, being, able, to, compete, by, 1930, 250, companies, which, did, not, had, disappeared, the, massive, demand, for, military, hardware, in, world, war, ii, prompted, assembly, line, techniques, in, shipbuilding, and, aircraft, production, thousands, of, liberty, ships, were, built, making, extensive, use, of, prefabrication, enabling, ship, assembly, to, be, completed, in, weeks, or, even, days, after, having, produced, fewer, than, 3, 000, planes, for, the, united, states, military, in, 1939, american, aircraft, manufacturers, built, over, 300, 000, planes, in, world, war, ii, vultee, pioneered, the, use, of, the, powered, assembly, line, for, aircraft, manufacturing, other, companies, quickly, followed, as, william, s, knudsen, having, worked, at, ford, gm, and, the, national, defense, advisory, commission, observed, we, won, because, we, smothered, the, enemy, in, an, avalanche, of, production, the, like, of, which, he, had, never, seen, nor, dreamed, possible, in, his, 1922, autobiography, henry, ford, mentions, several, benefits, of, the, assembly, line, including, the, gains, in, productivity, allowed, ford, to, increase, worker, pay, from, 1, 50, per, day, to, 5, 00, per, day, once, employees, reached, three, years, of, service, on, the, assembly, line, ford, continued, on, to, reduce, the, hourly, work, week, while, continuously, lowering, the, model, t, price, these, goals, appear, altruistic, however, it, has, been, argued, that, they, were, implemented, by, ford, in, order, to, reduce, high, employee, turnover, when, the, assembly, line, was, introduced, in, 1913, it, was, discovered, that, every, time, the, company, wanted, to, add, 100, men, to, its, factory, personnel, it, was, necessary, to, hire, 963, in, order, to, counteract, the, natural, distaste, the, assembly, line, seems, to, have, inspired, sociological, work, has, explored, the, social, alienation, and, boredom, that, many, workers, feel, because, of, the, repetition, of, doing, the, same, specialized, task, all, day, long, karl, marx, expressed, in, his, theory, of, alienation, the, belief, that, in, order, to, achieve, job, satisfaction, workers, need, to, see, themselves, in, the, objects, they, have, created, that, products, should, be, mirrors, in, which, workers, see, their, reflected, essential, nature, marx, viewed, labour, as, a, chance, for, people, to, externalize, facets, of, their, personalities, marxists, argue, that, performing, repetitive, specialized, tasks, causes, a, feeling, of, disconnection, between, what, a, worker, does, all, day, who, they, really, are, and, what, they, would, ideally, be, able, to, contribute, to, society, furthermore, marx, views, these, specialised, jobs, as, insecure, since, the, worker, is, expendable, as, soon, as, costs, rise, and, technology, can, replace, more, expensive, human, labour, since, workers, have, to, stand, in, the, same, place, for, hours, and, repeat, the, same, motion, hundreds, of, times, per, day, repetitive, stress, injuries, are, a, possible, pathology, of, occupational, safety, industrial, noise, also, proved, dangerous, when, it, was, not, too, high, workers, were, often, prohibited, from, talking, charles, piaget, a, skilled, worker, at, the, lip, factory, recalled, that, besides, being, prohibited, from, speaking, the, semi, skilled, workers, had, only, 25, centimeters, in, which, to, move, industrial, ergonomics, later, tried, to, minimize, physical, trauma
