solar, power, also, known, as, solar, electricity, is, the, conversion, of, energy, from, sunlight, into, electricity, either, directly, using, photovoltaics, pv, or, indirectly, using, concentrated, solar, power, solar, panels, use, the, photovoltaic, effect, to, convert, light, into, an, electric, current, concentrated, solar, power, systems, use, lenses, or, mirrors, and, solar, tracking, systems, to, focus, a, large, area, of, sunlight, to, a, hot, spot, often, to, drive, a, steam, turbine, photovoltaics, pv, were, initially, solely, used, as, a, source, of, electricity, for, small, and, medium, sized, applications, from, the, calculator, powered, by, a, single, solar, cell, to, remote, homes, powered, by, an, off, grid, rooftop, pv, system, commercial, concentrated, solar, power, plants, were, first, developed, in, the, 1980s, since, then, as, the, cost, of, solar, panels, has, fallen, grid, connected, solar, pv, systems, capacity, and, production, has, doubled, about, every, three, years, three, quarters, of, new, generation, capacity, is, solar, with, both, millions, of, rooftop, installations, and, gigawatt, scale, photovoltaic, power, stations, continuing, to, be, built, in, 2023, solar, power, generated, 5, 5, 1, 631, twh, of, global, electricity, and, over, 1, of, primary, energy, adding, twice, as, much, new, electricity, as, coal, along, with, onshore, wind, power, utility, scale, solar, is, the, source, with, the, cheapest, levelised, cost, of, electricity, for, new, installations, in, most, countries, as, of, 2023, 33, countries, generated, more, than, a, tenth, of, their, electricity, from, solar, with, china, making, up, more, than, half, of, solar, growth, almost, half, the, solar, power, installed, in, 2022, was, mounted, on, rooftops, much, more, low, carbon, power, is, needed, for, electrification, and, to, limit, climate, change, the, international, energy, agency, said, in, 2022, that, more, effort, was, needed, for, grid, integration, and, the, mitigation, of, policy, regulation, and, financing, challenges, nevertheless, solar, may, greatly, cut, the, cost, of, energy, geography, affects, solar, energy, potential, because, different, locations, receive, different, amounts, of, solar, radiation, in, particular, with, some, variations, areas, that, are, closer, to, the, equator, generally, receive, higher, amounts, of, solar, radiation, however, solar, panels, that, can, follow, the, position, of, the, sun, can, significantly, increase, the, solar, energy, potential, in, areas, that, are, farther, from, the, equator, daytime, cloud, cover, can, reduce, the, light, available, for, solar, cells, land, availability, also, has, a, large, effect, on, the, available, solar, energy, solar, power, plants, use, one, of, two, technologies, a, solar, cell, or, photovoltaic, cell, is, a, device, that, converts, light, into, electric, current, using, the, photovoltaic, effect, the, first, solar, cell, was, constructed, by, charles, fritts, in, the, 1880s, the, german, industrialist, ernst, werner, von, siemens, was, among, those, who, recognized, the, importance, of, this, discovery, in, 1931, the, german, engineer, bruno, lange, developed, a, photo, cell, using, silver, selenide, in, place, of, copper, oxide, although, the, prototype, selenium, cells, converted, less, than, 1, of, incident, light, into, electricity, following, the, work, of, russell, ohl, in, the, 1940s, researchers, gerald, pearson, calvin, fuller, and, daryl, chapin, created, the, silicon, solar, cell, in, 1954, these, early, solar, cells, cost, us, 286, watt, and, reached, efficiencies, of, 4, 5, 6, in, 1957, mohamed, m, atalla, developed, the, process, of, silicon, surface, passivation, by, thermal, oxidation, at, bell, labs, the, surface, passivation, process, has, since, been, critical, to, solar, cell, efficiency, as, of, 2022, over, 90, of, the, market, is, crystalline, silicon, the, array, of, a, photovoltaic, system, or, pv, system, produces, direct, current, dc, power, which, fluctuates, with, the, sunlight, s, intensity, for, practical, use, this, usually, requires, conversion, to, alternating, current, ac, through, the, use, of, inverters, multiple, solar, cells, are, connected, inside, panels, panels, are, wired, together, to, form, arrays, then, tied, to, an, inverter, which, produces, power, at, the, desired, voltage, and, for, ac, the, desired, frequency, phase, many, residential, pv, systems, are, connected, to, the, grid, when, available, especially, in, developed, countries, with, large, markets, in, these, grid, connected, pv, systems, use, of, energy, storage, is, optional, in, certain, applications, such, as, satellites, lighthouses, or, in, developing, countries, batteries, or, additional, power, generators, are, often, added, as, back, ups, such, stand, alone, power, systems, permit, operations, at, night, and, at, other, times, of, limited, sunlight, in, vertical, agrivoltaics, system, solar, cells, are, oriented, vertically, on, farmland, to, allow, the, land, to, both, grow, crops, and, generate, renewable, energy, other, configurations, include, floating, solar, farms, placing, solar, canopies, over, parking, lots, and, installing, solar, panels, on, roofs, a, thin, film, solar, cell, is, a, second, generation, solar, cell, that, is, made, by, depositing, one, or, more, thin, layers, or, thin, film, tf, of, photovoltaic, material, on, a, substrate, such, as, glass, plastic, or, metal, thin, film, solar, cells, are, commercially, used, in, several, technologies, including, cadmium, telluride, cdte, copper, indium, gallium, diselenide, cigs, and, amorphous, thin, film, silicon, a, si, tf, si, a, perovskite, solar, cell, psc, is, a, type, of, solar, cell, that, includes, a, perovskite, structured, compound, most, commonly, a, hybrid, organic, inorganic, lead, or, tin, halide, based, material, as, the, light, harvesting, active, layer, perovskite, materials, such, as, methylammonium, lead, halides, and, all, inorganic, cesium, lead, halide, are, cheap, to, produce, and, simple, to, manufacture, concentrated, solar, power, csp, also, called, concentrated, solar, thermal, uses, lenses, or, mirrors, and, tracking, systems, to, concentrate, sunlight, then, uses, the, resulting, heat, to, generate, electricity, from, conventional, steam, driven, turbines, a, wide, range, of, concentrating, technologies, exists, among, the, best, known, are, the, parabolic, trough, the, compact, linear, fresnel, reflector, the, dish, stirling, and, the, solar, power, tower, various, techniques, are, used, to, track, the, sun, and, focus, light, in, all, of, these, systems, a, working, fluid, is, heated, by, the, concentrated, sunlight, and, is, then, used, for, power, generation, or, energy, storage, thermal, storage, efficiently, allows, overnight, electricity, generation, thus, complementing, pv, csp, generates, a, very, small, share, of, solar, power, and, in, 2022, the, iea, said, that, csp, should, be, better, paid, for, its, storage, as, of, 2021, the, levelized, cost, of, electricity, from, csp, is, over, twice, that, of, pv, however, their, very, high, temperatures, may, prove, useful, to, help, decarbonize, industries, perhaps, via, hydrogen, which, need, to, be, hotter, than, electricity, can, provide, a, hybrid, system, combines, solar, with, energy, storage, and, or, one, or, more, other, forms, of, generation, hydro, wind, and, batteries, are, commonly, combined, with, solar, the, combined, generation, may, enable, the, system, to, vary, power, output, with, demand, or, at, least, smooth, the, solar, power, fluctuation, there, is, much, hydro, worldwide, and, adding, solar, panels, on, or, around, existing, hydro, reservoirs, is, particularly, useful, because, hydro, is, usually, more, flexible, than, wind, and, cheaper, at, scale, than, batteries, and, existing, power, lines, can, sometimes, be, used, the, early, development, of, solar, technologies, starting, in, the, 1860s, was, driven, by, an, expectation, that, coal, would, soon, become, scarce, such, as, experiments, by, augustin, mouchot, charles, fritts, installed, the, world, s, first, rooftop, photovoltaic, solar, array, using, 1, efficient, selenium, cells, on, a, new, york, city, roof, in, 1884, however, development, of, solar, technologies, stagnated, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, face, of, the, increasing, availability, economy, and, utility, of, coal, and, petroleum, bell, telephone, laboratories, 1950s, research, used, silicon, wafers, with, a, thin, coating, of, boron, the, bell, solar, battery, was, described, as, 6, efficient, with, a, square, yard, of, the, panels, generating, 50, watts, the, first, satellite, with, solar, panels, was, launched, in, 1957, by, the, 1970s, solar, panels, were, still, too, expensive, for, much, other, than, satellites, in, 1974, it, was, estimated, that, only, six, private, homes, in, all, of, north, america, were, entirely, heated, or, cooled, by, functional, solar, power, systems, however, the, 1973, oil, embargo, and, 1979, energy, crisis, caused, a, reorganization, of, energy, policies, around, the, world, and, brought, renewed, attention, to, developing, solar, technologies, deployment, strategies, focused, on, incentive, programs, such, as, the, federal, photovoltaic, utilization, program, in, the, us, and, the, sunshine, program, in, japan, other, efforts, included, the, formation, of, research, facilities, in, the, united, states, seri, now, nrel, japan, nedo, and, germany, fraunhofer, ise, between, 1970, and, 1983, installations, of, photovoltaic, systems, grew, rapidly, in, the, united, states, president, jimmy, carter, set, a, target, of, producing, 20, of, u, s, energy, from, solar, by, the, year, 2000, but, his, successor, ronald, reagan, removed, the, funding, for, research, into, renewables, falling, oil, prices, in, the, early, 1980s, moderated, the, growth, of, photovoltaics, from, 1984, to, 1996, in, the, mid, 1990s, development, of, both, residential, and, commercial, rooftop, solar, as, well, as, utility, scale, photovoltaic, power, stations, began, to, accelerate, again, due, to, supply, issues, with, oil, and, natural, gas, global, warming, concerns, and, the, improving, economic, position, of, pv, relative, to, other, energy, technologies, in, the, early, 2000s, the, adoption, of, feed, in, tariffs, a, policy, mechanism, that, gives, renewables, priority, on, the, grid, and, defines, a, fixed, price, for, the, generated, electricity, led, to, a, high, level, of, investment, security, and, to, a, soaring, number, of, pv, deployments, in, europe, for, several, years, worldwide, growth, of, solar, pv, was, driven, by, european, deployment, but, it, then, shifted, to, asia, especially, china, and, japan, and, to, a, growing, number, of, countries, and, regions, all, over, the, world, the, largest, manufacturers, of, solar, equipment, were, based, in, china, although, concentrated, solar, power, capacity, grew, more, than, tenfold, it, remained, a, tiny, proportion, of, the, total, 51, because, the, cost, of, utility, scale, solar, pv, fell, by, 85, between, 2010, and, 2020, while, csp, costs, only, fell, 68, in, the, same, timeframe, despite, the, rising, cost, of, materials, such, as, polysilicon, during, the, 2021, 2022, global, energy, crisis, utility, scale, solar, was, still, the, least, expensive, energy, source, in, many, countries, due, to, the, rising, costs, of, other, energy, sources, such, as, natural, gas, in, 2022, global, solar, generation, capacity, exceeded, 1, tw, for, the, first, time, however, fossil, fuel, subsidies, have, slowed, the, growth, of, solar, generation, capacity, about, half, of, installed, capacity, is, utility, scale, most, new, renewable, capacity, between, 2022, and, 2027, is, forecast, to, be, solar, surpassing, coal, as, the, largest, source, of, installed, power, capacity, 26, utility, scale, is, forecast, to, become, the, largest, source, of, electricity, in, all, regions, except, sub, saharan, africa, by, 2050, according, to, a, 2021, study, global, electricity, generation, potential, of, rooftop, solar, panels, is, estimated, at, 27, pwh, per, year, at, costs, ranging, from, 40, asia, to, 240, per, mwh, us, europe, its, practical, realization, will, however, depend, on, the, availability, and, cost, of, scalable, electricity, storage, solutions, a, photovoltaic, power, station, also, known, as, a, solar, park, solar, farm, or, solar, power, plant, is, a, large, scale, grid, connected, photovoltaic, power, system, pv, system, designed, for, the, supply, of, merchant, power, they, are, different, from, most, building, mounted, and, other, decentralized, solar, power, because, they, supply, power, at, the, utility, level, rather, than, to, a, local, user, or, users, utility, scale, solar, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, this, type, of, project, this, approach, differs, from, concentrated, solar, power, the, other, major, large, scale, solar, generation, technology, which, uses, heat, to, drive, a, variety, of, conventional, generator, systems, both, approaches, have, their, own, advantages, and, disadvantages, but, to, date, for, a, variety, of, reasons, photovoltaic, technology, has, seen, much, wider, use, as, of, 2019, about, 97, of, utility, scale, solar, power, capacity, was, pv, in, some, countries, the, nameplate, capacity, of, photovoltaic, power, stations, is, rated, in, megawatt, peak, mw, p, which, refers, to, the, solar, array, s, theoretical, maximum, dc, power, output, in, other, countries, the, manufacturer, states, the, surface, and, the, efficiency, however, canada, japan, spain, and, the, united, states, often, specify, using, the, converted, lower, nominal, power, output, in, mw, ac, a, measure, more, directly, comparable, to, other, forms, of, power, generation, most, solar, parks, are, developed, at, a, scale, of, at, least, 1, mw, p, as, of, 2018, the, world, s, largest, operating, photovoltaic, power, stations, surpassed, 1, gigawatt, at, the, end, of, 2019, about, 9, 000, solar, farms, were, larger, than, 4, mw, ac, utility, scale, with, a, combined, capacity, of, over, 220, gw, ac, commercial, concentrating, solar, power, csp, plants, also, called, solar, thermal, power, stations, were, first, developed, in, the, 1980s, the, 377, mw, ivanpah, solar, power, facility, located, in, california, s, mojave, desert, is, the, world, s, largest, solar, thermal, power, plant, project, other, large, csp, plants, include, the, solnova, solar, power, station, 150, mw, the, andasol, solar, power, station, 150, mw, and, extresol, solar, power, station, 150, mw, all, in, spain, the, principal, advantage, of, csp, is, the, ability, to, efficiently, add, thermal, storage, allowing, the, dispatching, of, electricity, over, up, to, a, 24, hour, period, since, peak, electricity, demand, typically, occurs, at, about, 5, pm, many, csp, power, plants, use, 3, to, 5, hours, of, thermal, storage, the, typical, cost, factors, for, solar, power, include, the, costs, of, the, modules, the, frame, to, hold, them, wiring, inverters, labour, cost, any, land, that, might, be, required, the, grid, connection, maintenance, and, the, solar, insolation, that, location, will, receive, photovoltaic, systems, use, no, fuel, and, modules, typically, last, 25, to, 40, years, thus, upfront, capital, and, financing, costs, make, up, 80, to, 90, of, the, cost, of, solar, power, 165, which, is, a, problem, for, countries, where, contracts, may, not, be, honoured, such, as, some, african, countries, some, countries, are, considering, price, caps, whereas, others, prefer, contracts, for, difference, in, many, countries, solar, power, is, the, lowest, cost, source, of, electricity, in, saudi, arabia, a, power, purchase, agreement, ppa, was, signed, in, april, 2021, for, a, new, solar, power, plant, in, al, faisaliah, the, project, has, recorded, the, world, s, lowest, cost, for, solar, pv, electricity, production, of, usd, 1, 04, cents, kwh, expenses, of, high, power, band, solar, modules, has, greatly, decreased, over, time, beginning, in, 1982, the, cost, per, kw, was, approximately, 27, 000, american, dollars, and, in, 2006, the, cost, dropped, to, approximately, 4, 000, american, dollars, per, kw, the, pv, system, in, 1992, cost, approximately, 16, 000, american, dollars, per, kw, and, it, dropped, to, approximately, 6, 000, american, dollars, per, kw, in, 2008, in, 2021, in, the, us, residential, solar, cost, from, 2, to, 4, dollars, watt, but, solar, shingles, cost, much, more, and, utility, solar, costs, were, around, 1, watt, the, productivity, of, solar, power, in, a, region, depends, on, solar, irradiance, which, varies, through, the, day, and, year, and, is, influenced, by, latitude, and, climate, pv, system, output, power, also, depends, on, ambient, temperature, wind, speed, solar, spectrum, the, local, soiling, conditions, and, other, factors, onshore, wind, power, tends, to, be, the, cheapest, source, of, electricity, in, northern, eurasia, canada, some, parts, of, the, united, states, and, patagonia, in, argentina, whereas, in, other, parts, of, the, world, mostly, solar, power, or, less, often, a, combination, of, wind, solar, and, other, low, carbon, energy, is, thought, to, be, best, 8, modelling, by, exeter, university, suggests, that, by, 2030, solar, will, be, least, expensive, in, all, countries, except, for, some, in, north, eastern, europe, the, locations, with, highest, annual, solar, irradiance, lie, in, the, arid, tropics, and, subtropics, deserts, lying, in, low, latitudes, usually, have, few, clouds, and, can, receive, sunshine, for, more, than, ten, hours, a, day, these, hot, deserts, form, the, global, sun, belt, circling, the, world, this, belt, consists, of, extensive, swathes, of, land, in, northern, africa, southern, africa, southwest, asia, middle, east, and, australia, as, well, as, the, much, smaller, deserts, of, north, and, south, america, thus, solar, is, or, is, predicted, to, become, the, cheapest, source, of, energy, in, all, of, central, america, africa, the, middle, east, india, south, east, asia, australia, and, several, other, regions, 8, different, measurements, of, solar, irradiance, direct, normal, irradiance, global, horizontal, irradiance, are, mapped, below, in, cases, of, self, consumption, of, solar, energy, the, payback, time, is, calculated, based, on, how, much, electricity, is, not, purchased, from, the, grid, however, in, many, cases, the, patterns, of, generation, and, consumption, do, not, coincide, and, some, or, all, of, the, energy, is, fed, back, into, the, grid, the, electricity, is, sold, and, at, other, times, when, energy, is, taken, from, the, grid, electricity, is, bought, the, relative, costs, and, prices, obtained, affect, the, economics, in, many, markets, the, price, paid, for, sold, pv, electricity, is, significantly, lower, than, the, price, of, bought, electricity, which, incentivizes, self, consumption, moreover, separate, self, consumption, incentives, have, been, used, in, e, g, germany, and, italy, grid, interaction, regulation, has, also, included, limitations, of, grid, feed, in, in, some, regions, in, germany, with, high, amounts, of, installed, pv, capacity, by, increasing, self, consumption, the, grid, feed, in, can, be, limited, without, curtailment, which, wastes, electricity, a, good, match, between, generation, and, consumption, is, key, for, high, self, consumption, the, match, can, be, improved, with, batteries, or, controllable, electricity, consumption, however, batteries, are, expensive, and, profitability, may, require, the, provision, of, other, services, from, them, besides, self, consumption, increase, for, example, avoiding, power, outages, hot, water, storage, tanks, with, electric, heating, with, heat, pumps, or, resistance, heaters, can, provide, low, cost, storage, for, self, consumption, of, solar, power, shiftable, loads, such, as, dishwashers, tumble, dryers, and, washing, machines, can, provide, controllable, consumption, with, only, a, limited, effect, on, the, users, but, their, effect, on, self, consumption, of, solar, power, may, be, limited, the, original, political, purpose, of, incentive, policies, for, pv, was, to, facilitate, an, initial, small, scale, deployment, to, begin, to, grow, the, industry, even, where, the, cost, of, pv, was, significantly, above, grid, parity, to, allow, the, industry, to, achieve, the, economies, of, scale, necessary, to, reach, grid, parity, since, reaching, grid, parity, some, policies, are, implemented, to, promote, national, energy, independence, high, tech, job, creation, and, reduction, of, co, 2, emissions, financial, incentives, for, photovoltaics, differ, across, countries, including, australia, china, germany, india, japan, and, the, united, states, and, even, across, states, within, the, us, in, net, metering, the, price, of, the, electricity, produced, is, the, same, as, the, price, supplied, to, the, consumer, and, the, consumer, is, billed, on, the, difference, between, production, and, consumption, net, metering, can, usually, be, done, with, no, changes, to, standard, electricity, meters, which, accurately, measure, power, in, both, directions, and, automatically, report, the, difference, and, because, it, allows, homeowners, and, businesses, to, generate, electricity, at, a, different, time, from, consumption, effectively, using, the, grid, as, a, giant, storage, battery, with, net, metering, deficits, are, billed, each, month, while, surpluses, are, rolled, over, to, the, following, month, best, practices, call, for, perpetual, roll, over, of, kwh, credits, excess, credits, upon, termination, of, service, are, either, lost, or, paid, for, at, a, rate, ranging, from, wholesale, to, retail, rate, or, above, as, can, be, excess, annual, credits, a, community, solar, project, is, a, solar, power, installation, that, accepts, capital, from, and, provides, output, credit, and, tax, benefits, to, multiple, customers, including, individuals, businesses, nonprofits, and, other, investors, participants, typically, invest, in, or, subscribe, to, a, certain, kw, capacity, or, kwh, generation, of, remote, electrical, production, in, some, countries, tariffs, import, taxes, are, imposed, on, imported, solar, panels, the, overwhelming, majority, of, electricity, produced, worldwide, is, used, immediately, because, traditional, generators, can, adapt, to, demand, and, storage, is, usually, more, expensive, both, solar, power, and, wind, power, are, sources, of, variable, renewable, power, meaning, that, all, available, output, must, be, used, locally, carried, on, transmission, lines, to, be, used, elsewhere, or, stored, e, g, in, a, battery, since, solar, energy, is, not, available, at, night, storing, it, so, as, to, have, continuous, electricity, availability, is, potentially, an, important, issue, particularly, in, off, grid, applications, and, for, future, 100, renewable, energy, scenarios, solar, is, intermittent, due, to, the, day, night, cycles, and, variable, weather, conditions, however, solar, power, can, be, forecast, somewhat, by, time, of, day, location, and, seasons, the, challenge, of, integrating, solar, power, in, any, given, electric, utility, varies, significantly, in, places, with, hot, summers, and, mild, winters, solar, tends, to, be, well, matched, to, daytime, cooling, demands, concentrated, solar, power, plants, may, use, thermal, storage, to, store, solar, energy, such, as, in, high, temperature, molten, salts, these, salts, are, an, effective, storage, medium, because, they, are, low, cost, have, a, high, specific, heat, capacity, and, can, deliver, heat, at, temperatures, compatible, with, conventional, power, systems, this, method, of, energy, storage, is, used, for, example, by, the, solar, two, power, station, allowing, it, to, store, 1, 44, tj, in, its, 68, m, 3, storage, tank, enough, to, provide, full, output, for, close, to, 39, hours, with, an, efficiency, of, about, 99, in, stand, alone, pv, systems, batteries, are, traditionally, used, to, store, excess, electricity, with, grid, connected, photovoltaic, power, systems, excess, electricity, can, be, sent, to, the, electrical, grid, net, metering, and, feed, in, tariff, programs, give, these, systems, a, credit, for, the, electricity, they, produce, this, credit, offsets, electricity, provided, from, the, grid, when, the, system, cannot, meet, demand, effectively, trading, with, the, grid, instead, of, storing, excess, electricity, when, wind, and, solar, are, a, small, fraction, of, the, grid, power, other, generation, techniques, can, adjust, their, output, appropriately, but, as, these, forms, of, variable, power, grow, additional, balance, on, the, grid, is, needed, as, prices, are, rapidly, declining, pv, systems, increasingly, use, rechargeable, batteries, to, store, a, surplus, to, be, used, later, at, night, batteries, used, for, grid, storage, can, stabilize, the, electrical, grid, by, leveling, out, peak, loads, for, a, few, hours, in, the, future, less, expensive, batteries, could, play, an, important, role, on, the, electrical, grid, as, they, can, charge, during, periods, when, generation, exceeds, demand, and, feed, their, stored, energy, into, the, grid, when, demand, is, higher, than, generation, common, battery, technologies, used, in, today, s, home, pv, systems, include, nickel, cadmium, lead, acid, nickel, metal, hydride, and, lithium, ion, lithium, ion, batteries, have, the, potential, to, replace, lead, acid, batteries, in, the, near, future, as, they, are, being, intensively, developed, and, lower, prices, are, expected, due, to, economies, of, scale, provided, by, large, production, facilities, such, as, the, tesla, gigafactory, 1, in, addition, the, li, ion, batteries, of, plug, in, electric, cars, may, serve, as, future, storage, devices, in, a, vehicle, to, grid, system, since, most, vehicles, are, parked, an, average, of, 95, of, the, time, their, batteries, could, be, used, to, let, electricity, flow, from, the, car, to, the, power, lines, and, back, retired, electric, vehicle, ev, batteries, can, be, repurposed, other, rechargeable, batteries, used, for, distributed, pv, systems, include, sodium, sulfur, and, vanadium, redox, batteries, two, prominent, types, of, a, molten, salt, and, a, flow, battery, respectively, solar, power, plants, while, they, can, be, curtailed, usually, simply, output, as, much, power, as, possible, therefore, in, an, electricity, system, without, sufficient, grid, energy, storage, generation, from, other, sources, coal, biomass, natural, gas, nuclear, hydroelectricity, generally, go, up, and, down, in, reaction, to, the, rise, and, fall, of, solar, electricity, and, variations, in, demand, see, load, following, power, plant, conventional, hydroelectric, dams, work, very, well, in, conjunction, with, solar, power, water, can, be, held, back, or, released, from, a, reservoir, as, required, where, suitable, geography, is, not, available, pumped, storage, hydroelectricity, can, use, solar, power, to, pump, water, to, a, high, reservoir, on, sunny, days, then, the, energy, is, recovered, at, night, and, in, bad, weather, by, releasing, water, via, a, hydroelectric, plant, to, a, low, reservoir, where, the, cycle, can, begin, again, while, hydroelectric, and, natural, gas, plants, can, quickly, respond, to, changes, in, load, coal, biomass, and, nuclear, plants, usually, take, considerable, time, to, respond, to, load, and, can, only, be, scheduled, to, follow, the, predictable, variation, depending, on, local, circumstances, beyond, about, 20, 40, of, total, generation, grid, connected, intermittent, sources, like, solar, tend, to, require, investment, in, some, combination, of, grid, interconnections, energy, storage, or, demand, side, management, in, countries, with, high, solar, generation, such, as, australia, electricity, prices, may, become, negative, in, the, middle, of, the, day, when, solar, generation, is, high, thus, incentivizing, new, battery, storage, the, combination, of, wind, and, solar, pv, has, the, advantage, that, the, two, sources, complement, each, other, because, the, peak, operating, times, for, each, system, occur, at, different, times, of, the, day, and, year, the, power, generation, of, such, solar, hybrid, power, systems, is, therefore, more, constant, and, fluctuates, less, than, each, of, the, two, component, subsystems, solar, power, is, seasonal, particularly, in, northern, southern, climates, away, from, the, equator, suggesting, a, need, for, long, term, seasonal, storage, in, a, medium, such, as, hydrogen, or, pumped, hydroelectric, solar, power, is, cleaner, than, electricity, from, fossil, fuels, so, can, be, better, for, the, environment, solar, power, does, not, lead, to, harmful, emissions, during, operation, but, the, production, of, the, panels, creates, some, pollution, the, carbon, footprint, of, manufacturing, is, less, than, 1kg, co, 2, wp, and, this, is, expected, to, fall, as, manufacturers, use, more, clean, electricity, and, recycled, materials, solar, power, carries, an, upfront, cost, to, the, environment, via, production, with, a, carbon, payback, time, of, several, years, as, of, 2022, but, offers, clean, energy, for, the, remainder, of, their, 30, year, lifetime, the, life, cycle, greenhouse, gas, emissions, of, solar, farms, are, less, than, 50, gram, g, per, kilowatt, hour, kwh, but, with, battery, storage, could, be, up, to, 150, g, kwh, in, contrast, a, combined, cycle, gas, fired, power, plant, without, carbon, capture, and, storage, emits, around, 500, g, kwh, and, a, coal, fired, power, plant, about, 1000, g, kwh, similar, to, all, energy, sources, where, their, total, life, cycle, emissions, are, mostly, from, construction, the, switch, to, low, carbon, power, in, the, manufacturing, and, transportation, of, solar, devices, would, further, reduce, carbon, emissions, lifecycle, surface, power, density, of, solar, power, varies, but, averages, about, 7, w, m2, compared, to, about, 240, for, nuclear, power, and, 480, for, gas, however, when, the, land, required, for, gas, extraction, and, processing, is, accounted, for, gas, power, is, estimated, to, have, not, much, higher, power, density, than, solar, pv, requires, much, larger, amounts, of, land, surface, to, produce, the, same, nominal, amount, of, energy, as, sources, with, higher, surface, power, density, and, capacity, factor, according, to, a, 2021, study, obtaining, 25, to, 80, of, electricity, from, solar, farms, in, their, own, territory, by, 2050, would, require, the, panels, to, cover, land, ranging, from, 0, 5, to, 2, 8, of, the, european, union, 0, 3, to, 1, 4, in, india, and, 1, 2, to, 5, 2, in, japan, and, south, korea, occupation, of, such, large, areas, for, pv, farms, could, drive, residential, opposition, as, well, as, lead, to, deforestation, removal, of, vegetation, and, conversion, of, farm, land, however, some, countries, such, as, south, korea, and, japan, use, land, for, agriculture, under, pv, or, floating, solar, together, with, other, low, carbon, power, sources, worldwide, land, use, has, minimal, ecological, impact, land, use, can, be, reduced, to, the, level, of, gas, power, by, installing, on, buildings, and, other, built, up, areas, harmful, materials, are, used, in, the, production, of, solar, panels, but, generally, in, small, amounts, as, of, 2022, the, environmental, impact, of, perovskite, is, difficult, to, estimate, but, there, is, some, concern, that, lead, may, be, a, problem, a, 2021, international, energy, agency, study, projects, the, demand, for, copper, will, double, by, 2040, the, study, cautions, that, supply, needs, to, increase, rapidly, to, match, demand, from, large, scale, deployment, of, solar, and, required, grid, upgrades, more, tellurium, and, indium, may, also, be, needed, recycling, may, help, as, solar, panels, are, sometimes, replaced, with, more, efficient, panels, the, second, hand, panels, are, sometimes, reused, in, developing, countries, for, example, in, africa, several, countries, have, specific, regulations, for, the, recycling, of, solar, panels, although, maintenance, cost, is, already, low, compared, to, other, energy, sources, some, academics, have, called, for, solar, power, systems, to, be, designed, to, be, more, repairable, solar, pannels, can, increase, local, temperature, in, large, installation, in, the, desert, the, effect, can, be, stronger, than, the, urban, heat, island, a, very, small, proportion, of, solar, power, is, concentrated, solar, power, concentrated, solar, power, may, use, much, more, water, than, gas, fired, power, this, can, be, a, problem, as, this, type, of, solar, power, needs, strong, sunlight, so, is, often, built, in, deserts, solar, generation, cannot, be, cut, off, by, geopolitics, once, installed, unlike, oil, and, gas, which, contributes, to, energy, security, as, of, 2022, over, 40, of, global, polysilicon, manufacturing, capacity, is, in, xinjiang, in, china, which, raises, concerns, about, human, rights, violations, xinjiang, internment, camps, according, to, the, international, solar, energy, society, china, s, dominance, of, manufacturing, is, not, a, problem, both, because, they, estimate, solar, manufacturing, cannot, grow, to, more, than, 400b, usd, per, year, and, because, if, chinese, supply, was, cut, off, other, countries, would, have, years, to, create, their, own, industry
