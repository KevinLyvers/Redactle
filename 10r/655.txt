tapestry, is, a, form, of, textile, art, traditionally, woven, by, hand, on, a, loom, normally, it, is, used, to, create, images, rather, than, patterns, tapestry, is, relatively, fragile, and, difficult, to, make, so, most, historical, pieces, are, intended, to, hang, vertically, on, a, wall, or, sometimes, in, tents, or, sometimes, horizontally, over, a, piece, of, furniture, such, as, a, table, or, bed, some, periods, made, smaller, pieces, often, long, and, narrow, and, used, as, borders, for, other, textiles, most, weavers, use, a, natural, warp, thread, such, as, wool, linen, or, cotton, the, weft, threads, are, usually, wool, or, cotton, but, may, include, silk, gold, silver, or, other, alternatives, in, late, medieval, europe, tapestry, was, the, grandest, and, most, expensive, medium, for, figurative, images, in, two, dimensions, and, despite, the, rapid, rise, in, importance, of, painting, it, retained, this, position, in, the, eyes, of, many, renaissance, patrons, until, at, least, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, if, not, beyond, the, european, tradition, continued, to, develop, and, reflect, wider, changes, in, artistic, styles, until, the, french, revolution, and, napoleonic, wars, before, being, revived, on, a, smaller, scale, in, the, 19th, century, technically, tapestry, is, weft, faced, weaving, in, which, all, the, warp, threads, are, hidden, in, the, completed, work, unlike, most, woven, textiles, where, both, the, warp, and, the, weft, threads, may, be, visible, in, tapestry, weaving, weft, yarns, are, typically, discontinuous, unlike, brocade, the, artisan, interlaces, each, coloured, weft, back, and, forth, in, its, own, small, pattern, area, it, is, a, plain, weft, faced, weave, having, weft, threads, of, different, colours, worked, over, portions, of, the, warp, to, form, the, design, european, tapestries, are, normally, made, to, be, seen, only, from, one, side, and, often, have, a, plain, lining, added, on, the, back, however, other, traditions, such, as, chinese, kesi, and, that, of, pre, columbian, peru, make, tapestry, to, be, seen, from, both, sides, tapestry, should, be, distinguished, from, the, different, technique, of, embroidery, although, large, pieces, of, embroidery, with, images, are, sometimes, loosely, called, tapestry, as, with, the, famous, bayeux, tapestry, which, is, in, fact, embroidered, from, the, middle, ages, on, european, tapestries, could, be, very, large, with, images, containing, dozens, of, figures, they, were, often, made, in, sets, so, that, a, whole, room, could, be, hung, with, them, in, english, tapestry, has, two, senses, both, of, which, apply, to, most, of, the, works, discussed, here, firstly, it, means, work, using, the, tapestry, weaving, technique, described, above, and, below, and, secondly, it, means, a, rather, large, textile, wall, hanging, with, a, figurative, design, some, embroidered, works, like, the, bayeux, tapestry, meet, the, second, definition, but, not, the, first, the, situation, is, complicated, by, the, french, equivalent, tapisserie, also, covering, needlepoint, work, which, can, lead, to, confusion, especially, with, pieces, such, as, furniture, covers, where, both, techniques, are, used, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, earliest, use, in, english, was, in, a, will, of, 1434, mentioning, a, lectum, meum, de, tapstriwerke, cum, leonibus, cum, pelicano, they, give, a, wide, definition, covering, a, textile, fabric, decorated, with, designs, of, ornament, or, pictorial, subjects, painted, embroidered, or, woven, in, colours, used, for, wall, hangings, curtains, covers, for, seats, before, mentioning, especially, those, woven, in, a, tapestry, weave, the, word, tapestry, derives, from, old, french, tapisserie, from, tapisser, meaning, to, cover, with, heavy, fabric, to, carpet, in, turn, from, tapis, heavy, fabric, via, latin, tapes, gen, tapetis, which, is, the, latinisation, of, the, greek, tap, s, gen, tap, tos, carpet, rug, the, earliest, attested, form, of, the, word, is, the, mycenaean, greek, ta, pe, ja, written, in, the, linear, b, syllabary, tapestry, was, not, the, common, english, term, until, near, the, end, of, the, classic, period, for, them, if, not, just, called, hangings, or, cloths, they, were, known, as, arras, from, the, period, when, arras, was, the, leading, production, centre, arazzo, is, still, the, term, for, tapestry, in, italian, while, a, number, of, european, languages, use, variants, based, on, gobelins, after, the, french, factory, for, example, both, danish, and, hungarian, use, gobelin, and, in, danish, tapet, means, wallpaper, thomas, campbell, argues, that, in, documents, relating, to, the, tudor, royal, collection, from, 1510, onwards, arras, specifically, meant, tapestries, using, gold, thread, tapestry, is, a, type, of, weaving, various, designs, of, looms, can, be, used, including, upright, or, high, warp, looms, where, the, tapestry, is, stretched, vertically, in, front, of, the, weaver, or, horizontal, low, warp, looms, which, were, usual, in, large, medieval, and, renaissance, workshops, but, later, mostly, used, for, smaller, pieces, the, weaver, always, works, on, the, back, of, the, piece, and, is, normally, following, a, full, size, drawn, or, painted, cartoon, or, possibly, another, tapestry, depending, on, the, set, up, this, reverses, is, a, mirror, image, of, the, tapestry, image, the, cartoon, was, generally, created, from, a, smaller, modello, which, in, industrial, workshops, from, at, least, the, late, middle, ages, on, was, produced, by, a, professional, artist, who, often, had, little, or, no, further, involvement, in, the, process, the, cartoon, was, traced, onto, the, warp, lines, by, the, weaver, and, then, placed, where, it, could, still, be, seen, sometimes, through, a, mirror, when, it, hung, behind, the, weaver, with, low, warp, looms, the, cartoon, was, usually, cut, into, strips, and, placed, beneath, the, weaving, where, the, weaver, could, see, it, through, the, web, of, threads, the, raphael, cartoons, which, are, very, rare, examples, of, surviving, cartoons, were, cut, in, this, way, in, european, industrial, tapestries, the, warp, threads, were, normally, wool, but, in, more, artisanal, settings, and, older, ones, linen, was, often, used, the, weft, threads, were, wool, with, silk, silver, or, gold, thread, used, in, the, most, expensive, tapestries, some, famous, designs, such, as, the, sistine, chapel, tapestries, and, the, story, of, abraham, set, probably, first, made, for, king, henry, viii, survive, in, versions, with, precious, metals, and, other, versions, without, using, silk, might, increase, the, cost, by, four, times, and, adding, gold, thread, increased, the, cost, enormously, to, perhaps, fifty, times, that, of, wool, alone, the, weavers, were, usually, male, as, the, work, was, physically, demanding, spinning, the, threads, was, usually, a, female, preserve, apart, from, the, design, and, materials, the, quality, of, tapestries, varies, with, the, tightness, of, the, weaving, one, modern, measure, of, this, is, the, number, of, warp, threads, per, centimetre, it, is, estimated, that, a, single, weaver, could, produce, a, square, yard, of, medium, quality, tapestry, in, a, month, but, only, half, that, of, the, finest, quality, the, success, of, decorative, tapestry, can, be, partially, explained, by, its, portability, le, corbusier, once, called, tapestries, nomadic, murals, the, fully, hand, woven, tapestry, form, is, more, suitable, for, creating, new, figurative, designs, than, other, types, of, woven, textile, and, the, looms, could, be, much, larger, kings, and, noblemen, could, fold, up, and, transport, tapestries, from, one, residence, to, another, many, kings, had, wardrobe, departments, with, their, own, buildings, devoted, to, the, care, repair, and, movement, of, tapestries, which, were, folded, into, large, canvas, bags, and, carried, on, carts, in, churches, they, were, displayed, on, special, occasions, tapestries, were, also, draped, on, the, walls, of, palaces, and, castles, for, insulation, during, winter, as, well, as, for, decorative, display, for, special, ceremonial, processions, such, as, coronations, royal, entries, and, weddings, they, would, sometimes, be, displayed, outside, the, largest, and, best, tapestries, designed, for, more, public, spaces, in, palaces, were, only, displayed, on, special, occasions, reducing, wear, and, fading, presumably, the, smaller, personal, rooms, were, hung, permanently, many, smaller, pieces, were, made, as, covers, for, furniture, or, cushions, or, curtains, and, bed, hangings, others, especially, in, the, case, of, those, made, for, patrons, outside, the, top, of, the, elite, were, cut, up, and, reused, for, such, functions, when, they, or, tapestries, in, general, came, to, seem, old, fashioned, bags, and, sometimes, clothing, were, other, re, uses, the, beauvais, manufactory, became, rather, a, specialist, in, furniture, upholstery, which, enabled, it, to, survive, after, the, french, revolution, when, this, became, the, main, remaining, market, in, the, case, of, tapestries, with, precious, metal, thread, they, might, be, burned, to, recover, the, metal, as, charles, v, s, soldiers, did, to, some, of, the, sistine, chapel, tapestries, and, the, french, directory, government, did, in, the, 1790s, to, most, of, the, royal, collection, from, the, renaissance, in, the, middle, ages, and, the, renaissance, a, rich, tapestry, panel, woven, with, symbolic, emblems, mottoes, or, coats, of, arms, called, a, baldachin, canopy, of, state, or, cloth, of, state, was, hung, behind, and, over, a, throne, as, a, symbol, of, authority, the, seat, under, such, a, canopy, of, state, would, normally, be, raised, on, a, dais, as, paintings, came, to, be, regarded, as, more, important, works, of, art, typically, by, the, 17th, century, tapestries, in, palaces, were, moved, less, and, came, to, be, regarded, as, more, or, less, permanent, fittings, for, a, particular, room, it, was, at, this, point, that, many, old, tapestries, were, cut, to, allow, fitting, around, doors, and, windows, they, also, often, suffered, the, indignity, of, having, paintings, hung, on, top, of, them, some, new, tapestries, were, made, to, fit, around, a, specific, room, the, design, of, the, gobelins, set, from, croome, court, now, in, new, york, has, a, large, field, with, an, ornamental, design, that, could, easily, be, adjusted, in, size, to, fit, the, measurements, of, the, customer, s, room, much, is, unclear, about, the, early, history, of, tapestry, as, actual, survivals, are, very, rare, and, literary, mentions, in, greek, roman, and, other, literature, almost, never, give, enough, detail, to, establish, that, a, tapestry, technique, is, being, described, from, ancient, egypt, tapestry, weave, pieces, using, linen, were, found, in, the, tombs, of, both, thutmose, iv, d, 1391, or, 1388, bc, and, tutankhamen, c, 1323, bc, the, latter, a, glove, and, a, robe, pieces, in, wool, given, a, wide, range, of, dates, around, two, millennia, ago, have, been, found, in, a, cemetery, at, sanpul, shampula, and, other, sites, near, khotan, in, the, tarim, basin, they, appear, to, have, been, made, in, a, variety, of, places, including, the, hellenistic, world, the, largest, fragments, known, as, the, sampul, tapestry, and, probably, hellenistic, in, origin, apparently, came, from, a, large, wall, hanging, but, had, been, reused, to, make, a, pair, of, trousers, the, hestia, tapestry, from, byzantine, egypt, around, 500, 550, is, a, largely, intact, wool, piece, with, many, figures, around, the, enthroned, goddess, hestia, who, is, named, in, greek, letters, it, is, 114, x, 136, 5, cm, 44, 9, x, 53, 7, inches, with, a, rounded, top, and, was, presumably, hung, in, a, home, showing, the, persistence, of, greco, roman, paganism, at, this, late, date, the, cleveland, museum, of, art, has, a, comparable, enthroned, virgin, mary, of, similar, date, many, of, the, small, borders, and, patches, with, images, with, which, the, early, byzantine, world, liked, to, decorate, their, clothing, were, in, tapestry, a, number, of, survivals, from, around, the, year, 1000, show, the, development, of, a, frieze, shape, of, a, large, long, tapestry, that, is, relatively, short, in, height, these, were, apparently, designed, to, hang, around, a, hall, or, church, probably, rather, high, surviving, examples, have, nearly, all, been, preserved, in, churches, but, may, originally, have, been, secular, the, cloth, of, saint, gereon, from, around, 1000, has, a, repeat, pattern, centred, on, medallions, with, a, motif, of, a, bull, being, attacked, by, a, griffin, taken, from, byzantine, silk, or, its, persian, equivalent, but, probably, woven, locally, in, the, rhineland, it, survived, in, a, church, in, cologne, germany, the, five, strips, of, verhogdal, tapestries, from, sweden, and, dated, to, within, 70, years, of, 1100, have, designs, in, which, animals, greatly, outnumber, human, figures, and, have, been, given, various, interpretations, one, strip, has, geometrical, motifs, the, skog, tapestry, also, from, sweden, but, probably, early, 14th, century, is, comparable, in, style, the, most, famous, frieze, hanging, is, the, bayeux, tapestry, actually, an, embroidery, which, is, 68, 38, metres, long, and, 0, 5, metres, wide, 224, 3, ft, 1, 6, ft, and, would, have, been, even, longer, originally, this, was, made, in, england, probably, in, the, 1070s, and, the, narrative, of, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, 1066, is, very, clear, explained, by, tituli, in, latin, this, may, have, been, an, anglo, saxon, genre, as, the, liber, eliensis, records, that, the, widow, of, the, anglo, saxon, commander, byrhtnoth, gave, ely, abbey, a, tapestry, or, hanging, celebrating, his, deeds, presumably, in, the, style, of, the, bayeux, tapestry, the, only, surviving, example, of, such, a, work, this, was, given, immediately, after, his, death, in, 991, at, the, battle, of, maldon, so, had, probably, been, hanging, in, his, home, previously, a, group, with, narrative, religious, scenes, in, a, clearly, romanesque, style, that, relates, to, rhineland, illuminated, manuscripts, of, the, same, period, was, made, for, halberstadt, cathedral, in, germany, around, 1200, and, shaped, differently, to, fit, specific, spaces, these, may, well, have, been, made, by, nuns, or, the, secular, canonesses, of, nearby, quedlinburg, abbey, in, this, period, repeated, decorative, motifs, increasingly, often, heraldic, and, comparable, to, the, styles, of, imported, luxury, fabrics, such, as, byzantine, silk, seem, to, have, been, the, common, designs, of, the, tapestries, mentioned, above, the, cloth, of, st, gereon, best, represents, this, style, a, decisive, shift, in, european, tapestry, history, came, around, 1350, and, in, many, respects, set, the, pattern, for, the, industry, until, the, end, of, its, main, period, of, importance, in, the, upheavals, following, the, french, revolution, the, tapestries, made, for, the, very, small, number, of, customers, able, to, commission, the, best, pieces, were, now, extremely, large, and, extremely, expensive, very, often, made, in, sets, and, often, showed, complicated, narrative, or, allegorical, scenes, with, large, numbers, of, figures, they, were, made, in, large, workshops, concentrated, in, a, number, of, cities, in, a, relatively, small, region, of, northern, france, and, the, southern, netherlands, partly, to, be, near, supplies, of, english, wool, by, convention, all, these, are, often, called, flemish, tapestries, although, most, of, the, production, centres, were, not, in, fact, in, the, county, of, flanders, before, reaching, the, weaving, workshop, the, commissioning, process, typically, involved, a, patron, an, artist, and, a, merchant, or, dealer, who, sorted, out, the, arrangements, and, contracts, some, tapestries, seem, to, have, been, made, for, stock, before, a, customer, had, emerged, the, financing, of, the, considerable, costs, of, setting, up, a, workshop, is, often, obscure, especially, in, the, early, period, but, rulers, supported, some, workshops, or, other, wealthy, people, the, merchants, or, dealers, were, very, likely, also, involved, where, surviving, tapestries, from, before, around, 1600, were, made, is, often, unclear, from, 1528, brussels, by, then, clearly, the, main, centre, required, its, weavers, to, mark, tapestries, of, any, size, with, the, city, s, mark, and, that, of, the, weaver, or, merchant, at, any, one, time, from, 1350, to, 1600, probably, only, one, or, two, centres, could, produce, the, largest, and, finest, royal, orders, and, groups, of, highly, skilled, weavers, migrated, to, new, centres, often, driven, to, move, by, wars, or, the, plague, at, first, paris, led, the, field, but, the, english, occupation, there, after, 1418, sent, many, to, arras, already, a, centre, arras, in, turn, was, sacked, in, 1477, leading, to, the, rise, of, tournai, until, a, serious, plague, early, in, the, next, century, brussels, had, been, growing, in, importance, and, now, became, the, most, important, centre, which, it, remained, until, the, eighty, years, war, disrupted, all, the, netherlands, brussels, had, a, revival, in, the, early, 17th, century, but, from, around, 1650, the, french, factories, were, increasingly, overtaking, it, and, remained, dominant, until, both, fashion, and, the, upheavals, of, the, french, revolution, and, the, napoleonic, wars, brought, the, virtual, end, of, the, traditional, demand, for, large, tapestries, there, was, always, some, tapestry, weaving, mostly, in, rather, smaller, workshops, making, smaller, pieces, in, other, towns, in, northern, france, and, the, low, countries, this, was, also, the, case, in, other, parts, of, europe, especially, italy, and, germany, from, the, mid, 16th, century, many, rulers, encouraged, or, directly, established, workshops, capable, of, high, quality, work, in, their, domains, this, was, most, successful, in, france, but, tuscany, spain, england, and, eventually, russia, had, high, quality, workshops, normally, beginning, with, the, importation, of, a, group, of, skilled, workers, from, the, flemish, centres, the, main, weaving, centres, were, ruled, by, the, french, and, burgundian, branches, of, the, house, of, valois, who, were, extremely, important, patrons, in, the, late, medieval, period, this, began, with, the, four, sons, of, john, ii, of, france, d, 1362, whose, inventories, reveal, they, owned, hundreds, of, tapestries, between, them, almost, the, only, clear, survival, from, these, collections, and, the, most, famous, tapestry, from, the, 14th, century, is, the, huge, apocalypse, tapestry, a, very, large, set, made, for, louis, i, duke, of, anjou, in, paris, between, 1377, and, 1382, another, of, the, brothers, philip, the, bold, duke, of, burgundy, d, 1404, was, probably, an, even, more, extravagant, spender, and, presented, many, tapestries, to, other, rulers, around, europe, several, of, the, tapestry, weaving, centres, were, in, his, territories, and, his, gifts, can, be, seen, as, a, rather, successful, attempt, to, spread, the, taste, for, large, flemish, tapestries, to, other, courts, as, well, as, being, part, of, his, attempt, to, promote, the, status, of, his, duchy, apart, from, burgundy, and, france, tapestries, were, given, to, several, of, the, english, plantagenets, and, the, rulers, of, austria, prussia, aragon, milan, and, at, his, specific, request, to, the, ottoman, sultan, bazajet, i, as, part, of, a, ransom, deal, for, the, duke, s, son, none, of, the, tapestries, philip, commissioned, appear, to, survive, philip, s, taste, for, tapestries, was, to, continue, very, strongly, in, his, descendants, including, the, spanish, habsburgs, the, new, style, of, grand, tapestries, that, were, large, and, often, in, sets, mostly, showed, subjects, with, large, numbers, of, figures, representing, narrative, subjects, the, iconography, of, a, high, proportion, of, narrative, tapestries, goes, back, to, written, sources, the, bible, and, ovid, s, metamorphoses, being, two, popular, choices, it, is, a, feature, of, tapestry, weaving, in, contrast, to, painting, that, weaving, an, area, of, the, work, containing, only, relatively, plain, areas, of, the, composition, such, as, sky, grass, or, water, still, involves, a, relatively, large, amount, of, slow, and, skilled, work, this, together, with, the, client, s, expectation, of, an, effect, of, overpowering, magnificence, and, the, remoteness, of, the, main, centres, from, italian, influence, led, to, northern, compositions, remaining, crammed, with, figures, and, other, details, long, after, classicizing, trends, in, italian, renaissance, painting, had, reduced, the, crowding, in, paintings, an, important, challenge, to, the, northern, style, was, the, arrival, in, brussels, probably, in, 1516, of, the, raphael, cartoons, for, the, pope, s, sistine, chapel, commission, of, a, grand, set, depicting, the, acts, of, the, apostles, these, were, sent, from, rome, and, used, the, latest, monumental, classicizing, high, renaissance, style, which, was, also, reaching, the, north, through, prints, hunting, scenes, were, also, very, popular, these, were, usually, given, no, specific, setting, although, sometimes, the, commissioner, and, other, figures, might, be, given, portraits, the, four, devonshire, hunting, tapestries, 1430, 1450, v, a, probably, made, in, arras, are, perhaps, the, largest, set, of, 15th, century, survivals, showing, the, hunting, of, bears, boars, deer, swans, otters, and, falconry, very, fashionably, dressed, ladies, and, gentlemen, stroll, around, beside, the, slaughter, another, set, from, after, 1515, show, a, similar, late, medieval, style, although, partly, made, with, silk, so, extra, expensive, but, the, twelve, pieces, in, les, chasses, de, maximilien, 1530s, louvre, made, in, brussels, for, a, habsburg, patron, show, an, advanced, renaissance, compositional, style, adapted, to, tapestries, these, have, a, hunting, scene, for, each, month, in, the, year, and, also, show, specific, locations, around, the, city, goya, was, still, designing, hunting, scenes, in, the, 1770s, after, a, probable, gap, since, the, 11th, century, in, the, late, 14th, century, sets, of, tapestries, returned, as, the, grandest, medium, for, official, military, art, usually, celebrating, the, victories, of, the, person, commissioning, them, philip, the, bold, commissioned, a, battle, of, roosbeke, set, two, years, after, his, victory, in, 1382, which, was, five, metres, high, and, totalled, over, 41, metres, in, width, john, of, gaunt, duke, of, lancaster, insisted, it, was, changed, when, philip, displayed, it, at, a, diplomatic, meeting, in, calais, in, 1393, to, negotiate, a, peace, treaty, gaunt, regarded, the, subject, matter, as, inappropriate, for, the, occasion, the, portuguese, pastrana, tapestries, 1470s, were, an, early, example, and, a, rare, survival, from, so, early, many, sets, were, produced, of, the, lives, of, classical, heroes, that, included, many, battle, scenes, not, only, the, trojan, war, alexander, the, great, julius, caesar, and, constantine, i, were, commemorated, but, also, less, likely, figures, such, as, cyrus, the, great, of, ancient, persia, there, were, many, 15th, century, sets, of, contemporary, wars, especially, celebrating, habsburg, victories, charles, v, commissioned, a, large, set, after, his, decisive, victory, at, the, battle, of, pavia, in, 1525, a, set, is, now, in, the, museo, di, capodimonte, in, naples, when, he, led, an, expedition, to, north, africa, culminating, in, the, conquest, of, tunis, in, 1535, no, more, lasting, than, that, of, tangier, depicted, in, the, pastrana, tapestries, he, took, the, flemish, artist, jan, cornelisz, vermeyen, with, him, mainly, to, produce, drawings, for, the, set, of, tapestries, ordered, on, his, return, contemporary, military, subjects, became, rather, less, popular, as, many, 16th, century, wars, became, religious, sometimes, allegorical, subjects, were, chosen, to, cover, these, but, the, battle, of, lepanto, was, commemorated, with, a, brussels, set, and, the, defeat, of, the, spanish, armada, with, the, armada, tapestries, 1591, these, were, made, in, delft, by, a, team, who, also, made, many, tapestries, of, dutch, naval, victories, the, armada, set, were, destroyed, in, the, burning, of, parliament, in, 1834, but, are, known, from, prints, both, sets, adopted, a, high, and, distant, aerial, view, which, continued, in, many, later, sets, of, land, battles, often, combined, with, a, few, large, figures, in, the, foreground, the, french, tapestries, commissioned, by, louis, xiv, of, the, victories, early, in, his, reign, were, of, this, type, right, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, a, set, now, in, madrid, was, commissioned, of, the, triumphs, and, battles, of, archduke, albert, who, had, just, been, made, sovereign, of, the, spanish, netherlands, his, military, career, had, in, fact, been, rather, unsuccessful, the, city, council, of, antwerp, ordered, it, from, the, workshop, of, maarten, reymbouts, the, younger, in, brussels, to, be, first, seen, on, the, occasion, of, his, royal, entry, to, antwerp, in, late, 1599, a, set, produced, for, john, churchill, 1st, duke, of, marlborough, showing, his, victories, was, varied, for, different, clients, and, even, sold, to, one, of, his, opponents, maximilian, ii, emanuel, elector, of, bavaria, after, reworking, the, generals, faces, and, other, details, millefleur, or, millefleurs, was, a, background, style, of, many, different, small, flowers, and, plants, usually, shown, on, a, green, ground, as, though, growing, in, grass, often, various, animals, are, added, usually, all, at, about, the, same, size, so, that, a, rabbit, or, dove, and, a, unicorn, are, not, much, different, in, size, trees, are, usually, far, too, small, and, out, of, scale, with, the, flowers, around, them, a, feature, also, generally, found, in, medieval, painting, the, millefleur, style, was, used, for, a, range, of, different, subjects, from, about, 1400, to, 1550, but, mainly, between, about, 1480, and, 1520, in, many, subjects, the, millefleur, background, stretches, to, the, top, of, the, tapestry, eliminating, any, sky, the, minimization, of, sky, was, already, a, feature, of, tapestry, style, the, devonshire, hunting, tapestries, show, an, early, stage, of, the, style, prominent, millefleur, backgrounds, as, opposed, to, those, mostly, covered, with, figures, are, especially, a, feature, of, allegorical, and, courtly, subjects, the, lady, and, the, unicorn, set, in, paris, are, famous, examples, from, around, 1500, millefleur, backgrounds, became, very, common, for, heraldic, tapestries, which, were, one, of, the, most, popular, relatively, small, types, usually, more, tall, than, wide, these, usually, featured, the, coat, of, arms, of, the, patron, in, the, centre, with, a, wide, floral, field, they, would, often, be, hung, behind, the, patron, when, he, sat, in, state, or, dined, and, were, made, for, many, nobles, who, could, not, afford, the, huge, narrative, sets, bought, by, royalty, enghien, was, a, smaller, weaving, centre, that, seems, to, have, specialized, in, these, earlier, types, of, heraldic, tapestries, had, often, repeated, elements, of, the, heraldry, in, patterns, after, about, 1520, the, top, workshops, moved, away, from, millefleur, settings, towards, naturalistic, landscape, with, all, the, elements, sized, at, a, consistent, perspective, scale, tapestries, whose, main, content, was, landscape, and, animals, are, known, as, verdure, subjects, from, the, french, for, greenery, this, genre, has, suffered, more, than, most, from, colour, changes, as, the, greens, of, tapestries, are, especially, prone, to, fade, or, turn, to, blues, smaller, tapestries, of, this, type, remained, popular, until, the, 18th, century, and, had, the, advantage, that, workshops, could, make, them, without, a, specific, order, and, distribute, them, across, europe, via, a, network, of, dealers, from, about, 1600, they, followed, the, wider, trends, in, european, landscape, painting, and, prints, oudenarde, specialized, in, these, but, they, were, produced, in, many, towns, as, with, paintings, the, addition, of, a, figure, or, two, could, elevate, such, pieces, to, a, depiction, of, a, story, from, classical, mythology, or, a, hunting, subject, tapestry, weavers, in, the, netherlands, had, become, very, comfortable, working, with, the, gothic, style, by, the, late, 15th, century, and, were, slow, to, reflect, the, stylistic, changes, of, the, italian, renaissance, perhaps, pressure, from, the, customers, for, tapestries, led, the, way, prints, enabled, italian, designs, to, be, seen, in, the, north, a, distinctive, italian, subject, was, the, petrarchan, triumph, derived, from, his, poem, cycle, i, trionfi, before, 1374, the, first, recorded, tapestries, were, a, three, piece, set, ordered, by, duke, philip, the, bold, of, burgundy, from, paris, in, 1399, a, set, made, in, the, 1450s, for, giovanni, de, medici, a, leading, patron, of, the, latest, florentine, style, used, cartoons, sent, from, italy, to, the, netherlandish, weavers, but, the, subjects, suited, the, tapestry, weavers, style, as, most, designs, included, packed, crowds, of, elaborately, dressed, figures, and, there, were, moral, messages, to, be, drawn, the, 16th, century, continued, the, taste, for, tapestry, and, was, arguably, the, finest, period, in, the, history, of, the, medium, by, now, the, tapestry, producing, towns, were, mostly, ruled, by, the, habsburg, family, who, replaced, the, valois, as, the, dominant, patrons, at, the, start, of, the, century, tournai, was, perhaps, still, the, largest, weaving, centre, but, after, a, plague, it, was, replaced, by, brussels, which, as, the, netherlandish, administrative, capital, of, the, valois, and, habsburgs, in, recent, decades, was, probably, already, the, main, centre, for, the, highest, quality, weaving, by, 1500, but, there, were, many, other, towns, where, tapestries, were, woven, tapestries, were, commissioned, in, the, netherlands, by, rulers, across, europe, from, king, henry, viii, in, england, to, pope, leo, x, and, sigismund, ii, augustus, of, poland, and, lithuania, ownership, of, smaller, tapestries, was, also, spreading, more, widely, through, the, nobility, and, bourgeoisie, from, 1528, tapestries, of, larger, sizes, made, in, brussels, had, to, be, so, marked, and, with, the, maker, s, or, dealer, s, mark, making, the, task, of, the, historian, much, easier, after, an, agreement, between, the, relevant, guilds, in, 1476, the, cartoons, for, the, main, designs, had, to, be, supplied, by, a, member, of, the, painters, guild, while, the, weavers, could, elaborate, these, with, detail, especially, in, millefeur, designs, this, ensured, a, high, quality, of, design, for, brussels, pieces, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, late, gothic, styles, held, sway, and, both, the, most, famous, sets, of, millefleur, unicorn, tapestries, were, made, around, 1500, perhaps, to, designs, from, paris, the, lady, and, the, unicorn, now, paris, and, the, hunt, of, the, unicorn, now, new, york, pope, leo, s, set, for, the, sistine, chapel, designed, by, raphael, in, 1515, 16, marked, the, introduction, of, the, full, italian, high, renaissance, style, to, tapestry, and, the, top, northern, designers, now, attempted, to, adopt, it, which, was, rather, a, struggle, for, them, although, the, wide, distribution, of, prints, across, europe, gave, them, one, easy, route, which, many, took, les, chasses, de, maximilien, the, hunts, of, maximilian, was, a, series, of, twelve, huge, brussels, tapestries, designed, by, bernard, van, orley, in, the, 1530s, for, the, habsburgs, one, of, the, most, successful, efforts, to, achieve, an, up, to, date, renaissance, style, technically, brussels, tapestries, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 15th, century, had, already, become, sophisticated, enough, to, begin, to, incorporate, more, illusionistic, elements, distinguishing, between, different, textures, in, their, subject, matter, and, including, portraits, of, individuals, now, mostly, unknown, rather, than, generic, figures, over, the, century, oil, paintings, mostly, moved, from, a, panel, support, to, canvas, allowing, a, far, greater, size, and, began, to, compete, seriously, with, tapestries, the, authenticity, of, the, master, s, touch, that, paintings, allowed, but, tapestry, did, not, became, appreciated, by, the, most, sophisticated, patrons, including, the, habsburgs, however, charles, v, and, philip, ii, of, spain, continued, to, spend, huge, sums, on, tapestries, apparently, believing, them, the, most, magnificent, form, of, decoration, and, one, that, maintained, continuity, with, their, burgundian, ancestors, the, early, part, of, the, 17th, century, saw, the, taste, for, tapestry, among, the, elite, continuing, although, painting, was, steadily, gaining, ground, brussels, remained, much, the, most, important, weaving, centre, and, rubens, mostly, based, in, antwerp, not, far, away, brought, the, grand, baroque, style, to, the, medium, with, jacob, jordaens, and, others, also, designing, many, in, later, generations, important, designers, included, justus, van, egmont, d, 1674, ludwig, van, schoor, d, 1702, and, jan, van, orley, d, 1735, the, last, of, a, long, lasting, dynasty, the, brussels, workshops, declined, somewhat, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, both, as, large, flemish, baroque, paintings, took, some, of, their, market, and, french, competition, squeezed, the, remaining, niche, for, tapestries, production, in, paris, revived, from, 1608, flagging, in, the, civil, wars, of, the, 1640s, but, starting, again, in, 1658, when, nicolas, fouquet, founded, a, workshop, after, his, fall, colbert, mostly, merged, this, to, the, new, gobelins, manufactory, he, founded, for, the, king, in, 1663, which, continues, to, this, day, the, beauvais, manufactory, always, a, private, enterprise, was, founded, by, colbert, in, 1664, but, only, became, significant, from, twenty, years, later, aubusson, tapestry, probably, a, continuation, of, earlier, small, workshops, continued, but, was, to, become, more, significant, in, the, next, century, the, gobelins, works, fed, designs, in, the, latest, style, louis, xiv, by, the, court, artists, became, increasingly, dominant, over, the, rest, of, the, century, and, by, 1700, was, the, most, admired, and, imitated, workshop, in, europe, the, mortlake, tapestry, works, outside, london, were, founded, in, 1619, with, encouragement, from, king, charles, i, of, england, using, flemish, weavers, at, the, start, and, in, the, 1620s, and, 1630s, were, producing, some, of, the, best, quality, tapestry, in, europe, the, medici, workshop, in, florence, continued, and, from, 1630, was, joined, by, one, in, rome, started, by, cardinal, francesco, barberini, with, the, inevitable, imported, flemish, director, both, the, mortlake, and, rome, workshops, petered, out, around, the, end, of, the, century, in, germany, workshops, were, established, in, munich, in, 1604, and, some, nine, further, cities, by, the, end, of, the, century, many, sponsored, by, the, local, ruler, around, the, start, of, the, century, there, was, increased, interest, in, landscape, subjects, some, still, with, hunting, scenes, but, others, showing, genre, subjects, of, rural, life, few, new, workshops, were, begun, in, the, century, the, main, exception, being, the, royal, tapestry, factory, in, madrid, this, was, started, in, 1720, soon, after, spain, lost, its, territories, in, flanders, under, the, treaty, of, utrecht, philip, v, of, spain, brought, jacob, van, der, goten, and, six, of, his, sons, to, madrid, much, the, best, known, tapestries, are, those, designed, by, francisco, goya, from, 1775, these, mostly, show, genre, scenes, of, lovers, or, country, people, recreating, both, his, cartoons, and, the, tapestries, made, from, them, mostly, survive, with, many, of, the, cartoons, in, the, prado, and, the, tapestries, still, in, the, royal, palaces, as, with, raphael, s, cartoons, for, the, sistine, chapel, tapestries, modern, critics, tend, to, prefer, the, cartoons, the, works, were, privately, owned, by, the, van, der, gotens, and, descendants, until, 1997, and, the, last, member, of, the, family, resigned, as, chair, in, 2002, apart, from, pauses, during, wars, the, works, has, continued, to, produce, tapestries, around, the, mid, century, the, new, rococo, style, proved, very, effective, in, tapestries, now, a, good, deal, smaller, than, before, fran, ois, boucher, produced, 45, cartoons, for, beauvais, and, then, by, 1753, followed, the, animal, painter, jean, baptiste, oudry, as, artistic, director, at, gobelins, oudry, s, best, known, set, was, the, eight, strong, the, pastoral, amusements, made, from, the, 1720s, onwards, in, many, repetitions, during, the, second, half, of, the, century, the, main, brussels, workshops, gradually, closed, the, last, in, 1794, tapestry, suited, neither, neoclassicism, nor, romanticism, very, well, and, this, together, with, the, disruptions, of, the, french, revolution, and, napoleonic, wars, brought, the, production, of, large, figurative, tapestries, almost, to, a, halt, across, europe, in, the, 19th, century, william, morris, resurrected, the, art, of, tapestry, making, in, the, medieval, style, at, merton, abbey, morris, co, made, successful, series, of, tapestries, for, home, and, ecclesiastical, uses, with, figures, based, on, cartoons, by, edward, burne, jones, the, set, of, six, holy, grail, tapestries, of, the, 1890s, repeated, a, number, of, times, are, the, largest, they, made, and, perhaps, the, most, successful, traditional, tapestries, are, still, made, at, the, gobelins, factory, in, paris, and, the, royal, factory, in, madrid, they, and, a, few, other, old, european, workshops, also, repair, and, restore, old, tapestries, the, main, british, workshop, is, at, hampton, court, palace, a, department, of, the, royal, collection, trust, the, chinese, kesi, is, a, tapestry, weave, normally, using, silk, on, a, small, scale, compared, to, european, wall, hangings, clothing, for, the, court, was, one, of, the, main, uses, the, density, of, knots, is, typically, very, high, with, a, gown, of, the, best, quality, perhaps, involving, as, much, work, as, a, much, larger, european, tapestry, initially, used, for, small, pieces, often, with, animal, bird, and, flower, decoration, or, dragons, for, imperial, clothing, under, the, ming, dynasty, it, was, used, to, copy, paintings, the, death, of, polydorus, is, one, of, an, unusual, set, of, seven, large, tapestry, hangings, made, in, china, for, the, portuguese, governor, of, macao, in, the, 1620s, blending, western, and, chinese, styles, most, of, the, hangings, are, embroidery, but, the, faces, and, flesh, parts, of, the, figures, are, appliqu, painted, silk, satin, pieces, reflecting, a, chinese, technique, often, used, for, buddhist, banners, and, the, larger, forms, of, thangka, kilims, and, navajo, rugs, are, also, types, of, tapestry, work, the, designs, of, both, mostly, restricted, to, geometrical, patterns, similar, to, those, of, other, rug, weaving, techniques, what, distinguishes, the, contemporary, field, from, its, pre, world, war, ii, history, is, the, predominance, of, the, artist, as, weaver, in, the, contemporary, medium, this, trend, has, its, roots, in, france, during, the, 1950s, where, one, of, the, cartoonists, for, the, aubusson, tapestry, studios, jean, lur, at, spearheaded, a, revival, of, the, medium, by, streamlining, colour, selection, thereby, simplifying, production, and, by, organizing, a, series, of, biennial, exhibits, held, in, lausanne, switzerland, the, polish, work, submitted, to, the, first, biennale, which, opened, in, 1962, was, quite, novel, traditional, workshops, in, poland, had, collapsed, as, a, result, of, the, war, also, art, supplies, in, general, were, hard, to, acquire, many, polish, artists, had, learned, to, weave, as, part, of, their, art, school, training, and, began, creating, highly, individualistic, work, by, using, atypical, materials, like, jute, and, sisal, with, each, biennale, the, popularity, of, works, focusing, on, exploring, innovative, constructions, from, a, wide, variety, of, fiber, resounded, around, the, world, there, were, many, weavers, in, pre, war, united, states, but, there, had, never, been, a, prolonged, system, of, workshops, for, producing, tapestries, therefore, weavers, in, america, were, primarily, self, taught, and, chose, to, design, as, well, as, weave, their, art, through, these, lausanne, exhibitions, us, artists, weavers, and, others, in, countries, all, over, the, world, were, excited, about, the, polish, trend, towards, experimental, forms, throughout, the, 1970s, almost, all, weavers, had, explored, some, manner, of, techniques, and, materials, in, vogue, at, the, time, what, this, movement, contributed, to, the, newly, realized, field, of, art, weaving, termed, contemporary, tapestry, was, the, option, for, working, with, texture, with, a, variety, of, materials, and, with, the, freedom, for, individuality, in, design, in, the, 1980s, it, became, clear, that, the, process, of, weaving, weft, faced, tapestry, had, another, benefit, that, of, stability, the, artists, who, chose, tapestry, as, their, medium, developed, a, broad, range, of, personal, expression, styles, and, subject, matter, stimulated, and, nourished, by, an, international, movement, to, revive, and, renew, tapestry, traditions, from, all, over, the, world, competing, for, commissions, and, expanding, exhibition, venues, were, essential, factors, in, how, artists, defined, and, accomplished, their, goals, much, of, the, impetus, in, the, 1980s, for, working, in, this, more, traditional, process, came, from, the, bay, area, in, northern, california, where, twenty, years, earlier, mark, adams, an, eclectic, artist, had, two, exhibitions, of, his, tapestry, designs, he, went, on, to, design, many, large, tapestries, for, local, buildings, hal, painter, another, well, respected, artist, in, the, area, became, a, prolific, tapestry, artist, during, the, decade, weaving, his, own, designs, he, was, one, of, the, main, artists, to, create, the, atmosphere, which, helped, give, birth, to, the, second, phase, of, the, contemporary, textile, movement, textiles, as, art, that, recognition, that, textiles, no, longer, had, to, be, utilitarian, functional, to, serve, as, interior, decoration, early, in, the, 1980s, many, artists, committed, to, getting, more, professional, and, often, that, meant, travelling, to, attend, the, rare, educational, programmes, offered, by, newly, formed, ateliers, such, as, the, san, francisco, tapestry, workshop, or, to, far, away, institutions, they, identified, as, fitting, their, needs, this, phenomenon, was, happening, in, europe, and, australia, as, well, as, in, north, america, opportunities, for, entering, juried, tapestry, exhibitions, were, beginning, to, happen, by, 1986, primarily, because, the, american, tapestry, alliance, ata, founded, in, 1982, organised, biennial, juried, exhibitions, starting, in, 1986, the, biennials, were, planned, to, coincide, with, the, handweavers, guild, or, america, s, convergence, conferences, the, new, potential, for, seeing, the, work, of, other, tapestry, artists, and, the, ability, to, observe, how, one, s, own, work, might, fare, in, such, venues, profoundly, increased, the, awareness, of, a, community, of, like, minded, artists, regional, groups, were, formed, for, producing, exhibits, and, sharing, information, the, desire, of, many, artists, for, greater, interaction, escalated, as, an, international, tapestry, symposium, in, melbourne, australia, in, 1988, lead, to, a, second, organization, committed, to, tapestry, the, international, tapestry, network, itnet, its, goal, was, to, connect, american, tapestry, artists, with, the, burgeoning, international, community, the, magazines, were, discontinued, in, 1997, as, communicating, digitally, became, a, more, useful, tool, for, interactions, as, the, world, has, moved, into, the, digital, age, tapestry, artists, around, the, world, continue, to, share, and, inspire, each, other, s, work, by, the, new, millennium, however, fault, lines, had, surfaced, within, the, field, many, universities, that, previously, had, strong, weaving, components, in, their, art, departments, such, as, san, francisco, state, university, no, longer, offered, handweaving, as, an, option, as, they, shifted, their, focus, to, computerized, equipment, a, primary, cause, for, discarding, the, practice, was, the, fact, that, only, one, student, could, use, the, equipment, for, the, duration, of, a, project, whereas, in, most, media, like, painting, or, ceramics, the, easels, or, potters, wheels, were, used, by, several, students, in, a, day, worldwide, people, from, all, different, cultures, began, adopting, these, forms, of, decor, for, profession, and, personal, use, at, the, same, time, fiber, art, had, become, one, of, the, most, popular, mediums, in, their, art, programmes, young, artists, were, interested, in, exploring, a, wider, scope, of, processes, for, creating, art, through, the, materials, classified, as, fibre, this, shift, to, more, multimedia, and, sculptural, forms, and, the, desire, to, produce, work, more, quickly, had, the, effect, of, pushing, contemporary, tapestry, artists, inside, and, outside, the, academic, institutions, to, ponder, how, they, might, keep, pace, in, order, to, sustain, visibility, in, their, art, form, susan, iverson, a, professor, in, the, school, of, the, arts, at, virginia, commonwealth, university, explains, her, reasons, i, came, to, tapestry, after, several, years, of, exploring, complex, weaves, i, became, enamored, with, tapestry, because, of, its, simplicity, its, straightforward, qualities, it, allowed, me, to, investigate, form, or, image, or, texture, and, it, had, the, structural, integrity, to, hold, its, own, form, i, loved, the, substantial, quality, of, a, tapestry, woven, with, heavy, threads, its, object, quality, another, prominent, artist, joan, baxter, states, my, passion, for, tapestry, arrived, suddenly, on, the, first, day, of, my, introduction, to, it, in, my, first, year, at, eca, i, don, t, remember, ever, having, consciously, thought, about, tapestry, before, that, day, but, i, somehow, knew, that, eventually, i, d, be, really, good, at, this, from, that, day, i, have, been, able, to, plough, a, straight, path, deeper, and, deeper, into, tapestry, through, my, studies, in, scotland, and, poland, my, 8, years, as, a, studio, weaver, in, england, and, australia, and, since, 1987, as, an, independent, tapestry, artist, the, demanding, creative, ethos, of, the, tapestry, department, gave, me, the, confidence, motivation, and, self, discipline, i, needed, to, move, out, into, the, world, as, a, professional, tapestry, weaver, and, artist, what, was, most, inspiring, for, me, as, a, young, student, was, that, my, tutors, in, the, department, were, all, practising, exhibiting, artists, engaging, positively, with, what, was, then, a, cutting, edge, international, fibre, art, movement, archie, brennan, now, in, his, sixth, decade, of, weaving, says, of, tapestry, 500, years, ago, it, was, already, extremely, sophisticated, in, its, development, aesthetically, technically, and, in, diversity, of, purpose, today, its, lack, of, a, defined, purpose, its, rarity, gives, me, an, opportunity, to, seek, new, roles, to, extend, its, historic, language, and, above, all, to, dominate, my, compulsive, creative, drive, in, 1967, i, made, a, formal, decision, to, step, away, from, the, burgeoning, and, exciting, fiber, arts, movement, and, to, refocus, on, woven, tapestry, s, long, established, graphic, pictorial, role, the, term, tapestry, may, also, be, used, to, describe, large, figurative, weft, faced, textiles, made, on, jacquard, looms, before, the, 1990s, tapestry, upholstery, fabrics, and, reproductions, of, the, famous, tapestries, of, the, middle, ages, had, been, produced, using, jacquard, techniques, but, more, recently, artists, such, as, chuck, close, patrick, lichty, and, the, workshop, magnolia, editions, have, adapted, the, computerised, jacquard, process, to, producing, fine, art, typically, tapestries, are, translated, from, the, original, design, via, a, process, resembling, paint, by, numbers, a, cartoon, is, divided, into, regions, each, of, which, is, assigned, a, solid, colour, based, on, a, standard, palette, however, in, jacquard, weaving, the, repeating, series, of, multicoloured, warp, and, weft, threads, can, be, used, to, create, colours, that, are, optically, blended, i, e, the, human, eye, apprehends, the, threads, combination, of, values, as, a, single, colour, this, method, can, be, likened, to, pointillism, which, originated, from, discoveries, made, in, the, tapestry, medium, the, style, s, emergence, in, the, 19th, century, can, be, traced, to, the, influence, of, michel, eug, ne, chevreul, a, french, chemist, responsible, for, developing, the, colour, wheel, of, primary, and, intermediary, hues, chevreul, worked, as, the, director, of, the, dye, works, at, les, gobelins, tapestry, works, in, paris, where, he, noticed, that, the, perceived, colour, of, a, particular, thread, was, influenced, by, its, surrounding, threads, a, phenomenon, he, called, simultaneous, contrast, chevreul, s, work, was, a, continuation, of, theories, of, colour, elaborated, by, leonardo, da, vinci, and, goethe, in, turn, his, work, influenced, painters, including, eug, ne, delacroix, and, georges, pierre, seurat, the, principles, articulated, by, chevreul, also, apply, to, contemporary, television, and, computer, displays, which, use, tiny, dots, of, red, green, and, blue, rgb, light, to, render, colour, with, each, composite, being, called, a, pixel
