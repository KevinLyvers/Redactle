then, displays, the, page, on, the, user, s, screen, browsers, are, used, on, a, range, of, devices, including, desktops, laptops, tablets, and, smartphones, by, 2020, an, estimated, 4, 9, billion, people, had, used, a, browser, the, most, used, browser, is, google, chrome, with, a, 64, global, market, share, on, all, devices, followed, by, safari, with, 19, a, web, browser, is, not, the, same, thing, as, a, search, engine, though, the, two, are, often, confused, a, search, engine, is, a, website, that, provides, links, to, other, websites, however, to, connect, to, a, website, s, server, and, display, its, web, pages, a, user, must, have, a, web, browser, installed, in, some, technical, contexts, browsers, are, referred, to, as, user, agents, the, purpose, of, a, web, browser, is, to, fetch, content, and, display, it, on, the, user, s, device, this, process, begins, when, the, user, inputs, a, uniform, resource, locator, url, such, as, https, en, wikipedia, org, into, the, browser, virtually, all, urls, on, the, web, start, with, either, http, or, https, which, means, they, are, retrieved, with, the, hypertext, transfer, protocol, http, for, secure, mode, https, the, connection,

contains, a, url, and, when, it, is, clicked, or, tapped, the, browser, navigates, to, the, new, resource, most, browsers, use, an, internal, cache, of, web, page, resources, to, improve, loading, times, for, subsequent, visits, to, the, same, page, the, cache, can, store, many, items, such, as, large, images, so, they, do, not, need, to, be, downloaded, from, the, server, again, cached, items, are, usually, only, stored, for, as, long, as, the, web, server, stipulates, in, its, http, response, messages, during, the, course, of, browsing, cookies, received, from, various, websites, are, stored, by, the, browser, some, of, them, contain, login, credentials, or, site, preferences, however, others, are, used, for, tracking, user, behavior, over, long, periods, of, time, so, browsers, typically, provide, a, section, in, the, menu, for, deleting, cookies, finer, grained, management, of, cookies, usually, requires, a, browser, extension, the, first, web, browser, called, worldwideweb, was, created, in, 1990, by, sir, tim, berners, lee, he, then, recruited, nicola, pellow, to, write, the, line, mode, browser, which, displayed, web, pages, on, dumb, terminals, the, mosaic, web, browser, was, released, in, april, 1993, and, was, later, credited, as, the, first, web, browser, to, find, mainstream, popularity, its, innovative, graphical, user, interface, made, the, world, wide, web, easy, to, navigate, and, thus, more, accessible, to, the, average, person, this, in, turn, sparked, the, internet, boom, of, the, 1990s, when, the, web, grew, at, a, very, rapid, rate, the, lead, developers, of, mosaic, then, founded, the, netscape, corporation, which, released, the, mosaic, influenced, netscape, navigator, in, 1994, navigator, quickly, became, the, most, popular, browser, microsoft, debuted, internet, explorer, in, 1995, leading, to, a, browser, war, with, netscape, within, a, few, years, microsoft, gained, a, dominant, position, in, the, browser, market, for, two, reasons, it, bundled, internet, explorer, with, its, popular, windows, operating, system, and, did, so, as, freeware, with, no, restrictions, on, usage, the, market, share, of, internet, explorer, peaked, at, over, 95, in, the, early, 2000s, in, 1998, netscape, launched, what, would, become, the, mozilla, foundation, to, create, a, new, browser, using, the, open, source, software, model, this, work, evolved, into, the, firefox, browser, first, released, by, mozilla, in, 2004, firefox, s, market, share, peaked, at, 32, in, 2010, apple, released, its, safari, browser, in, 2003, it, remains, the, dominant, browser, on, apple, devices, though, it, did, not, become, popular, elsewhere, google, debuted, its, chrome, browser, in, 2008, which, steadily, took, market, share, from, internet, explorer, and, became, the, most, popular, browser, in, 2012, chrome, has, remained, dominant, ever, since, by, 2015, microsoft, replaced, internet, explorer, with, edge, for, the, windows, 10, release, since, the, early, 2000s, browsers, have, greatly, expanded, their, html, css, javascript, and, multimedia, capabilities, one, reason, has, been, to, enable, more, sophisticated, websites, such, as, web, apps, another, factor, is, the, significant, increase, of, broadband, connectivity, in, many, parts, of, the, world, enabling, people, to, access, data, intensive, content, such, as, streaming, hd, video, on, youtube, that, was, not, possible, during, the, era, of, dial, up, modems, google, chrome, has, been, the, dominant, browser, since, the, mid, 2010s, and, currently, has, a, 64, global, market, share, on, all, devices, the, vast, majority, of, its, source, code, comes, from, google, s, open, source, chromium, project, this, code, is, also, the, basis, for, many, other, browsers, including, microsoft, edge, currently, in, third, place, with, about, a, 5, share, and, opera, and, samsung, internet, in, fifth, and, sixth, place, with, over, 2, each, the, other, two, browsers, in, the, top, four, are, made, from, different, codebases, safari, based, on, apple, s, webkit, code, is, dominant, on, apple, devices, resulting, in, a, 19, global, share, firefox, with, about, a, 3, share, is, based, on, mozilla, s, code, both, of, these, codebases, are, open, source, so, a, number, of, small, niche, browsers, are, also, made, from, them, the, most, popular, browsers, share, many, features, in, common, they, automatically, log, users, browsing, history, unless, the, users, turn, off, their, browsing, history, or, use, the, non, logging, private, mode, they, also, allow, users, to, set, bookmarks, customize, the, browser, with, extensions, and, can, manage, user, passwords, some, provide, a, sync, service, and, web, accessibility, features, common, user, interface, ui, features, while, mobile, browsers, have, similar, ui, features, as, desktop, versions, the, limitations, of, touch, screens, require, mobile, uis, to, be, simpler, the, difference, is, significant, for, users, accustomed, to, keyboard, shortcuts, the, most, popular, desktop, browsers, also, have, sophisticated, web, development, tools, web, browsers, are, popular, targets, for, hackers, who, exploit, security, holes, to, steal, information, destroy, files, and, other, malicious, activities, browser, vendors, regularly, patch, these, security, holes, so, users, are, strongly, encouraged, to, keep, their, browser, software, updated, other, protection, measures, are, antivirus, software, and, being, aware, of, scams
