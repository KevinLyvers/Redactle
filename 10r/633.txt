canvas, is, an, extremely, durable, plain, woven, fabric, used, for, making, sails, tents, marquees, backpacks, shelters, as, a, support, for, oil, painting, and, for, other, items, for, which, sturdiness, is, required, as, well, as, in, such, fashion, objects, as, handbags, electronic, device, cases, and, shoes, it, is, popularly, used, by, artists, as, a, painting, surface, typically, stretched, across, a, wooden, frame, modern, canvas, is, usually, made, of, cotton, or, linen, or, sometimes, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, although, historically, it, was, made, from, hemp, it, differs, from, other, heavy, cotton, fabrics, such, as, denim, in, being, plain, weave, rather, than, twill, weave, canvas, comes, in, two, basic, types, plain, and, duck, the, threads, in, duck, canvas, are, more, tightly, woven, the, term, duck, comes, from, the, dutch, word, for, cloth, doek, in, the, united, states, canvas, is, classified, in, two, ways, by, weight, ounces, per, square, yard, and, by, a, graded, number, system, the, numbers, run, in, reverse, of, the, weight, so, a, number, 10, canvas, is, lighter, than, number, 4, the, word, canvas, is, derived, from, the, 13th, century, anglo, french, canevaz, and, the, old, french, canevas, both, may, be, derivatives, of, the, vulgar, latin, cannapaceus, for, made, of, hemp, originating, from, the, greek, cannabis, canvas, has, become, the, most, common, support, medium, for, oil, painting, replacing, wooden, panels, it, was, used, from, the, 14th, century, in, italy, but, only, rarely, one, of, the, earliest, surviving, oils, on, canvas, is, a, french, madonna, with, angels, from, around, 1410, in, the, gem, ldegalerie, berlin, its, use, in, saint, george, and, the, dragon, by, paolo, uccello, in, about, 1470, and, sandro, botticelli, s, birth, of, venus, in, the, 1480s, was, still, unusual, for, the, period, large, paintings, for, country, houses, were, apparently, more, likely, to, be, on, canvas, and, are, perhaps, less, likely, to, have, survived, it, was, a, good, deal, cheaper, than, a, panel, painting, and, may, sometime, indicate, a, painting, regarded, as, less, important, in, the, uccello, the, armour, does, not, use, silver, leaf, as, other, of, his, paintings, do, and, the, colour, therefore, remains, undegraded, another, common, category, of, paintings, on, lighter, cloth, such, as, linen, was, in, distemper, or, glue, often, used, for, banners, to, be, carried, in, procession, this, is, a, less, durable, medium, and, surviving, examples, such, as, dirk, bouts, entombment, in, distemper, on, linen, 1450s, national, gallery, are, rare, and, often, rather, faded, in, appearance, panel, painting, remained, more, common, until, the, 16th, century, in, italy, and, the, 17th, century, in, northern, europe, mantegna, and, venetian, artists, were, among, those, leading, the, change, venetian, sail, canvas, was, readily, available, and, regarded, as, the, best, quality, canvas, is, usually, stretched, across, a, wooden, frame, called, a, stretcher, and, may, be, coated, with, gesso, prior, to, being, used, to, prevent, oil, paint, from, coming, into, direct, contact, with, the, canvas, fibres, which, would, eventually, cause, the, canvas, to, decay, a, traditional, and, flexible, chalk, gesso, is, composed, of, lead, carbonate, and, linseed, oil, applied, over, a, rabbit, skin, glue, ground, a, variation, using, titanium, white, pigment, and, calcium, carbonate, is, rather, brittle, and, susceptible, to, cracking, as, lead, based, paint, is, poisonous, care, has, to, be, taken, in, using, it, various, alternative, and, more, flexible, canvas, primers, are, commercially, available, the, most, popular, being, a, synthetic, latex, paint, composed, of, titanium, dioxide, and, calcium, carbonate, bound, with, a, thermo, plastic, emulsion, many, artists, have, painted, onto, unprimed, canvas, such, as, jackson, pollock, kenneth, noland, francis, bacon, helen, frankenthaler, dan, christensen, larry, zox, ronnie, landfield, color, field, painters, lyrical, abstractionists, and, others, staining, acrylic, paint, into, the, fabric, of, cotton, duck, canvas, was, more, benign, and, less, damaging, to, the, fabric, of, the, canvas, than, the, use, of, oil, paint, in, 1970, artist, helen, frankenthaler, commented, about, her, use, of, staining, when, i, first, started, doing, the, stain, paintings, i, left, large, areas, of, canvas, unpainted, i, think, because, the, canvas, itself, acted, as, forcefully, and, as, positively, as, paint, or, line, or, color, in, other, words, the, very, ground, was, part, of, the, medium, so, that, instead, of, thinking, of, it, as, background, or, negative, space, or, an, empty, spot, that, area, did, not, need, paint, because, it, had, paint, next, to, it, the, thing, was, to, decide, where, to, leave, it, and, where, to, fill, it, and, where, to, say, this, doesn, t, need, another, line, or, another, pail, of, colors, it, s, saying, it, in, space, early, canvas, was, made, of, linen, a, sturdy, brownish, fabric, of, considerable, strength, linen, is, particularly, suitable, for, the, use, of, oil, paint, in, the, early, 20th, century, cotton, canvas, often, referred, to, as, cotton, duck, came, into, use, linen, is, composed, of, higher, quality, material, and, remains, popular, with, many, professional, artists, especially, those, who, work, with, oil, paint, cotton, duck, which, stretches, more, fully, and, has, an, even, mechanical, weave, offers, a, more, economical, alternative, the, advent, of, acrylic, paint, has, greatly, increased, the, popularity, and, use, of, cotton, duck, canvas, linen, and, cotton, derive, from, two, entirely, different, plants, the, flax, plant, and, the, cotton, plant, respectively, gessoed, canvases, on, stretchers, are, also, available, they, are, available, in, a, variety, of, weights, light, weight, is, about, 4, oz, sq, yd, 140, g, m, 2, or, 5, oz, sq, yd, 170, g, m, 2, medium, weight, is, about, 7, oz, sq, yd, 240, g, m, 2, or, 8, oz, sq, yd, 270, g, m, 2, heavy, weight, is, about, 10, oz, sq, yd, 340, g, m, 2, or, 12, oz, sq, yd, 410, g, m, 2, they, are, prepared, with, two, or, three, coats, of, gesso, and, are, ready, for, use, straight, away, artists, desiring, greater, control, of, their, painting, surface, may, add, a, coat, or, two, of, their, preferred, gesso, professional, artists, who, wish, to, work, on, canvas, may, prepare, their, own, canvas, in, the, traditional, manner, one, of, the, most, outstanding, differences, between, modern, painting, techniques, and, those, of, the, flemish, and, dutch, masters, is, in, the, preparation, of, the, canvas, modern, techniques, take, advantage, of, both, the, canvas, texture, as, well, as, those, of, the, paint, itself, renaissance, masters, took, extreme, measures, to, ensure, that, none, of, the, texture, of, the, canvas, came, through, this, required, a, painstaking, months, long, process, of, layering, the, raw, canvas, with, usually, lead, white, paint, then, polishing, the, surface, and, then, repeating, the, final, product, had, little, resemblance, to, fabric, but, instead, had, a, glossy, enamel, like, finish, with, a, properly, prepared, canvas, the, painter, will, find, that, each, subsequent, layer, of, color, glides, on, in, a, buttery, manner, and, that, with, the, proper, consistency, of, application, fat, over, lean, technique, a, painting, entirely, devoid, of, brushstrokes, can, be, achieved, a, warm, iron, is, applied, over, a, piece, of, wet, cotton, to, flatten, the, wrinkles, canvas, can, also, be, printed, on, using, offset, or, specialist, digital, printers, to, create, canvas, prints, this, process, of, digital, inkjet, printing, is, popularly, referred, to, as, gicl, e, after, printing, the, canvas, can, be, wrapped, around, a, stretcher, and, displayed, canvas, is, a, popular, base, fabric, for, embroidery, such, as, cross, stitch, and, berlin, wool, work, some, specific, types, of, embroidery, canvases, are, aida, cloth, also, called, java, canvas, penelope, canvas, chess, canvas, and, binca, canvas, plastic, canvas, is, a, stiffer, form, of, binca, canvas, from, the, 13th, century, onwards, canvas, was, used, as, a, covering, layer, on, pavise, shields, the, canvas, was, applied, to, the, wooden, surface, of, the, pavise, covered, with, multiple, layers, of, gesso, and, often, richly, painted, in, tempera, technique, finally, the, surface, was, sealed, with, a, transparent, varnish, while, the, gessoed, canvas, was, a, perfect, painting, surface, the, primary, purpose, of, the, canvas, application, may, have, been, the, strengthening, of, the, wooden, shield, corpus, in, a, manner, similar, to, modern, glass, reinforced, plastic, splined, canvases, differ, from, traditional, side, stapled, canvas, in, that, canvas, is, attached, with, a, spline, at, the, rear, of, the, frame, this, allows, the, artist, to, incorporate, painted, edges, into, the, artwork, itself, without, staples, at, the, sides, and, the, artwork, can, be, displayed, without, a, frame, splined, canvas, can, be, restretched, by, adjusting, the, spline, stapled, canvases, stay, stretched, tighter, over, a, longer, period, of, time, but, are, more, difficult, to, re, stretch, when, the, need, arises, canvas, boards, are, made, of, canvas, stretched, over, and, glued, to, a, cardboard, backing, and, sealed, on, the, backside, the, canvas, is, typically, linen, primed, for, a, certain, type, of, paint, they, are, primarily, used, by, artists, for, quick, studies, understanding, the, mechanical, properties, of, art, canvases, is, necessary, for, art, conservation, especially, when, deciding, on, transporting, paintings, conservation, treatments, and, environmental, specifications, inside, museums, canvases, are, layered, structures, made, from, weaving, fibers, together, where, each, layer, responds, differently, to, changes, in, humidity, resulting, in, localized, stresses, that, cause, deformation, cracking, and, delamination, there, are, two, directions, to, the, canvas, the, warp, direction, threads, run, vertically, and, the, weft, direction, threads, run, horizontally, researchers, performed, tensile, testing, to, determine, the, effects, of, humidity, on, the, strength, of, canvases, and, observed, that, increasing, humidity, decreased, the, effective, elastic, modulus, combined, modulus, of, the, weft, and, warp, directions, for, example, the, effective, modulus, at, 30, relative, humidity, is, 180, mpa, which, drops, to, 13, mpa, at, 90, relative, humidity, suggesting, that, canvas, is, becoming, more, flexible, and, susceptible, to, deformation, there, is, an, inherent, anisotropy, to, the, elastic, modulus, measured, in, the, weft, and, warp, direction, as, evidenced, in, the, strain, vs, load, behavior, of, the, canvas, the, canvas, exhibits, a, 0, 1, strain, in, the, weft, direction, and, 0, 2, strain, in, the, warp, direction, before, failing, thread, ripping, apart, though, tensile, testing, provides, an, explicit, measure, of, material, strength, conservationists, are, unable, to, tare, a, piece, of, painting, to, create, the, samples, required, length, of, 250, mm, therefore, the, traditional, methods, of, assessing, mechanical, properties, have, been, visual, cues, and, ph, values, art, conservationists, have, recently, adopted, a, new, method, called, zero, span, strength, analysis, nanoindentation, and, numerical, modelling, to, quantitatively, evaluate, the, mechanical, properties, of, painting, canvases, zero, span, strength, analysis, measures, the, tensile, strength, of, materials, such, as, paper, and, yarns, by, reducing, the, clamping, distance, to, 0, 1, mm, and, applying, load, to, a, particular, point, on, the, yarn, this, minimizes, effects, from, material, geometry, and, accurately, assesses, intrinsic, fiber, strength, this, also, reduces, the, amount, of, material, needed, for, samples, to, 60, mm, using, zero, span, strength, analysis, conservationists, measured, tensile, strength, of, flax, commonly, used, canvas, material, in, historical, paintings, and, correlated, tensile, strength, to, the, degree, of, cellulose, depolymerization, cellulose, is, a, component, of, flax, another, method, for, assessing, canvas, quality, is, nanoindentation, utilizing, a, millimeter, sized, cantilever, with, a, microsphere, at, its, end, and, measuring, local, viscoelastic, properties, however, with, the, nanoindentation, method, conservationists, can, probe, the, composite, behavior, of, the, layers, of, paint, on, top, of, the, canvas, not, the, actual, strength, of, the, canvas, itself, lastly, conservationists, are, using, finite, element, modeling, fem, and, extended, fem, xfem, on, canvases, undergoing, desiccation, removal, of, moisture, to, visualize, the, global, and, local, stresses
