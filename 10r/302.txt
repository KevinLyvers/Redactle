a, skyscraper, is, a, tall, continuously, habitable, building, having, multiple, floors, modern, sources, define, skyscrapers, as, being, at, least, 100, meters, 330, ft, or, 150, meters, 490, ft, in, height, though, there, is, no, universally, accepted, definition, other, than, being, very, tall, high, rise, buildings, historically, the, term, first, referred, to, buildings, with, between, 10, and, 15, stories, when, these, types, of, buildings, began, to, be, constructed, in, the, 1880s, skyscrapers, may, host, offices, hotels, residential, spaces, and, retail, spaces, one, common, feature, of, skyscrapers, is, having, a, steel, frame, that, supports, curtain, walls, this, idea, was, invented, by, viollet, le, duc, in, his, discourses, on, architecture, these, curtain, walls, either, bear, on, the, framework, below, or, are, suspended, from, the, framework, above, rather, than, resting, on, load, bearing, walls, of, conventional, construction, some, early, skyscrapers, have, a, steel, frame, that, enables, the, construction, of, load, bearing, walls, taller, than, of, those, made, of, reinforced, concrete, modern, skyscraper, walls, are, not, load, bearing, and, most, skyscrapers, are, characterized, by, large, surface, areas, of, windows, made, possible, by, steel, frames, and, curtain, walls, however, skyscrapers, can, have, curtain, walls, that, mimic, conventional, walls, with, a, small, surface, area, of, windows, modern, skyscrapers, often, have, a, tubular, structure, and, are, designed, to, act, like, a, hollow, cylinder, to, resist, wind, seismic, and, other, lateral, loads, to, appear, more, slender, allow, less, wind, exposure, and, transmit, more, daylight, to, the, ground, many, skyscrapers, have, a, design, with, setbacks, which, in, some, cases, is, also, structurally, required, as, of, september, 2023, fifteen, cities, in, the, world, have, more, than, 100, skyscrapers, that, are, 150, m, 492, ft, or, taller, hong, kong, with, 552, skyscrapers, shenzhen, china, with, 373, skyscrapers, new, york, city, us, with, 314, skyscrapers, dubai, uae, with, 252, skyscrapers, guangzhou, china, with, 188, skyscrapers, shanghai, china, with, 183, skyscrapers, tokyo, japan, with, 168, skyscrapers, kuala, lumpur, malaysia, with, 156, skyscrapers, wuhan, china, with, 149, skyscrapers, chongqing, china, with, 144, skyscrapers, chicago, us, with, 137, skyscrapers, chengdu, china, with, 117, skyscrapers, jakarta, indonesia, with, 112, skyscrapers, bangkok, thailand, with, 111, skyscrapers, and, mumbai, india, with, 102, as, of, 2024, there, are, over, 7, thousand, skyscrapers, over, 150, m, 492, ft, in, height, worldwide, the, term, skyscraper, was, first, applied, to, buildings, of, steel, framed, construction, of, at, least, 10, stories, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, result, of, public, amazement, at, the, tall, buildings, being, built, in, major, american, cities, like, new, york, city, philadelphia, boston, chicago, detroit, and, st, louis, the, first, steel, frame, skyscraper, was, the, home, insurance, building, originally, 10, stories, with, a, height, of, 42, m, or, 138, ft, in, chicago, in, 1885, two, additional, stories, were, added, some, point, to, philadelphia, s, 10, story, jayne, building, 1849, 50, as, a, proto, skyscraper, or, to, new, york, s, seven, floor, equitable, life, building, built, in, 1870, steel, skeleton, construction, has, allowed, for, today, s, supertall, skyscrapers, now, being, built, worldwide, the, nomination, of, one, structure, versus, another, being, the, first, skyscraper, and, why, depends, on, what, factors, are, stressed, the, structural, definition, of, the, word, skyscraper, was, refined, later, by, architectural, historians, based, on, engineering, developments, of, the, 1880s, that, had, enabled, construction, of, tall, multi, story, buildings, this, definition, was, based, on, the, steel, skeleton, as, opposed, to, constructions, of, load, bearing, masonry, which, passed, their, practical, limit, in, 1891, with, chicago, s, monadnock, building, what, is, the, chief, characteristic, of, the, tall, office, building, it, is, lofty, it, must, be, tall, the, force, and, power, of, altitude, must, be, in, it, the, glory, and, pride, of, exaltation, must, be, in, it, it, must, be, every, inch, a, proud, and, soaring, thing, rising, in, sheer, exaltation, that, from, bottom, to, top, it, is, a, unit, without, a, single, dissenting, line, some, structural, engineers, define, a, high, rise, as, any, vertical, construction, for, which, wind, is, a, more, significant, load, factor, than, earthquake, or, weight, note, that, this, criterion, fits, not, only, high, rises, but, some, other, tall, structures, such, as, towers, different, organizations, from, the, united, states, and, europe, define, skyscrapers, as, buildings, at, least, 150, m, 490, ft, in, height, or, taller, with, supertall, skyscrapers, for, buildings, higher, than, 300, m, 984, ft, and, megatall, skyscrapers, for, those, taller, than, 600, m, 1, 969, ft, the, tallest, structure, in, ancient, times, was, the, 146, m, 479, ft, great, pyramid, of, giza, in, ancient, egypt, built, in, the, 26th, century, bc, it, was, not, surpassed, in, height, for, thousands, of, years, the, 160, m, 520, ft, lincoln, cathedral, having, exceeded, it, in, 1311, 1549, before, its, central, spire, collapsed, the, latter, in, turn, was, not, surpassed, until, the, 555, foot, 169, m, washington, monument, in, 1884, however, being, uninhabited, none, of, these, structures, actually, comply, with, the, modern, definition, of, a, skyscraper, high, rise, apartments, flourished, in, classical, antiquity, ancient, roman, insulae, in, imperial, cities, reached, 10, and, more, stories, beginning, with, augustus, r, 30, bc, 14, ad, several, emperors, attempted, to, establish, limits, of, 20, 25, m, for, multi, stories, buildings, but, were, met, with, only, limited, success, lower, floors, were, typically, occupied, by, shops, or, wealthy, families, with, the, upper, rented, to, the, lower, classes, surviving, oxyrhynchus, papyri, indicate, that, seven, stories, buildings, existed, in, provincial, towns, such, as, in, 3rd, century, ad, hermopolis, in, roman, egypt, the, skylines, of, many, important, medieval, cities, had, large, numbers, of, high, rise, urban, towers, built, by, the, wealthy, for, defense, and, status, the, residential, towers, of, 12th, century, bologna, numbered, between, 80, and, 100, at, a, time, the, tallest, of, which, is, the, 97, 2, m, 319, ft, high, asinelli, tower, a, florentine, law, of, 1251, decreed, that, all, urban, buildings, be, immediately, reduced, to, less, than, 26, m, even, medium, sized, towns, of, the, era, are, known, to, have, proliferations, of, towers, such, as, the, 72, towers, that, ranged, up, to, 51, m, height, in, san, gimignano, the, medieval, egyptian, city, of, fustat, housed, many, high, rise, residential, buildings, which, al, muqaddasi, in, the, 10th, century, described, as, resembling, minarets, nasir, khusraw, in, the, early, 11th, century, described, some, of, them, rising, up, to, 14, stories, with, roof, gardens, on, the, top, floor, complete, with, ox, drawn, water, wheels, for, irrigating, them, cairo, in, the, 16th, century, had, high, rise, apartment, buildings, where, the, two, lower, floors, were, for, commercial, and, storage, purposes, and, the, multiple, stories, above, them, were, rented, out, to, tenants, an, early, example, of, a, city, consisting, entirely, of, high, rise, housing, is, the, 16th, century, city, of, shibam, in, yemen, shibam, was, made, up, of, over, 500, tower, houses, each, one, rising, 5, to, 11, stories, high, with, each, floor, being, an, apartment, occupied, by, a, single, family, the, city, was, built, in, this, way, in, order, to, protect, it, from, bedouin, attacks, shibam, still, has, the, tallest, mudbrick, buildings, in, the, world, with, many, of, them, over, 30, m, 98, ft, high, an, early, modern, example, of, high, rise, housing, was, in, 17th, century, edinburgh, scotland, where, a, defensive, city, wall, defined, the, boundaries, of, the, city, due, to, the, restricted, land, area, available, for, development, the, houses, increased, in, height, instead, buildings, of, 11, stories, were, common, and, there, are, records, of, buildings, as, high, as, 14, stories, many, of, the, stone, built, structures, can, still, be, seen, today, in, the, old, town, of, edinburgh, the, oldest, iron, framed, building, in, the, world, although, only, partially, iron, framed, is, the, flaxmill, in, shrewsbury, england, built, in, 1797, it, is, seen, as, the, grandfather, of, skyscrapers, since, its, fireproof, combination, of, cast, iron, columns, and, cast, iron, beams, developed, into, the, modern, steel, frame, that, made, modern, skyscrapers, possible, in, 2013, funding, was, confirmed, to, convert, the, derelict, building, into, offices, in, 1857, elisha, otis, introduced, the, safety, elevator, at, the, e, v, haughwout, building, in, new, york, city, allowing, convenient, and, safe, transport, to, buildings, upper, floors, otis, later, introduced, the, first, commercial, passenger, elevators, to, the, equitable, life, building, in, 1870, considered, by, some, architectural, historians, to, be, the, first, skyscraper, another, crucial, development, was, the, use, of, a, steel, frame, instead, of, stone, or, brick, otherwise, the, walls, on, the, lower, floors, on, a, tall, building, would, be, too, thick, to, be, practical, an, early, development, in, this, area, was, oriel, chambers, in, liverpool, england, built, in, 1864, it, was, only, five, floors, high, the, royal, academy, of, arts, states, critics, at, the, time, were, horrified, by, its, large, agglomerations, of, protruding, plate, glass, bubbles, in, fact, it, was, a, precursor, to, modernist, architecture, being, the, first, building, in, the, world, to, feature, a, metal, framed, glass, curtain, wall, a, design, element, which, creates, light, airy, interiors, and, has, since, been, used, the, world, over, as, a, defining, feature, of, skyscrapers, further, developments, led, to, what, many, individuals, and, organizations, consider, the, world, s, first, skyscraper, the, ten, story, home, insurance, building, in, chicago, built, in, 1884, 1885, while, its, original, height, of, 42, 1, m, 138, ft, does, not, even, qualify, as, a, skyscraper, today, it, was, record, setting, the, building, of, tall, buildings, in, the, 1880s, gave, the, skyscraper, its, first, architectural, movement, broadly, termed, the, chicago, school, which, developed, what, has, been, called, the, commercial, style, the, architect, major, william, le, baron, jenney, created, a, load, bearing, structural, frame, in, this, building, a, steel, frame, supported, the, entire, weight, of, the, walls, instead, of, load, bearing, walls, carrying, the, weight, of, the, building, this, development, led, to, the, chicago, skeleton, form, of, construction, in, addition, to, the, steel, frame, the, home, insurance, building, also, utilized, fireproofing, elevators, and, electrical, wiring, key, elements, in, most, skyscrapers, today, burnham, and, root, s, 45, m, 148, ft, rand, mcnally, building, in, chicago, 1889, was, the, first, all, steel, framed, skyscraper, while, louis, sullivan, s, 41, m, 135, ft, wainwright, building, in, st, louis, missouri, 1891, was, the, first, steel, framed, building, with, soaring, vertical, bands, to, emphasize, the, height, of, the, building, and, is, therefore, considered, to, be, the, first, early, skyscraper, in, 1889, the, mole, antonelliana, in, italy, was, 197, m, 549, ft, tall, most, early, skyscrapers, emerged, in, the, land, strapped, areas, of, new, york, city, and, chicago, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, a, land, boom, in, melbourne, australia, between, 1888, and, 1891, spurred, the, creation, of, a, significant, number, of, early, skyscrapers, though, none, of, these, were, steel, reinforced, and, few, remain, today, height, limits, and, fire, restrictions, were, later, introduced, in, the, late, 1800s, london, builders, found, building, heights, limited, due, to, issues, with, existing, buildings, high, rise, development, in, london, is, restricted, at, certain, sites, if, it, would, obstruct, protected, views, of, st, paul, s, cathedral, and, other, historic, buildings, this, policy, st, paul, s, heights, has, officially, been, in, operation, since, 1927, concerns, about, aesthetics, and, fire, safety, had, likewise, hampered, the, development, of, skyscrapers, across, continental, europe, for, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, by, 1940, there, were, around, 100, high, rise, buildings, in, europe, list, of, early, skyscrapers, some, examples, of, these, are, the, 43, m, 141, ft, tall, 1898, witte, huis, white, house, in, rotterdam, the, 51, 5, m, 169, ft, tall, past, building, 1906, 1908, in, warsaw, the, royal, liver, building, in, liverpool, completed, in, 1911, and, 90, m, 300, ft, high, the, 57, m, 187, ft, tall, 1924, marx, house, in, d, sseldorf, the, 65, m, 213, ft, tall, borsigturm, in, berlin, built, in, 1924, the, 65, m, 213, ft, tall, hansahochhaus, in, cologne, germany, built, in, 1925, the, 61, m, 200, ft, kungstornen, kings, towers, in, stockholm, sweden, which, were, built, 1924, 25, the, 77, m, 253, ft, ullsteinhaus, in, berlin, germany, built, in, 1927, the, 89, m, 292, ft, edificio, telef, nica, in, madrid, spain, built, in, 1929, the, 87, 5, m, 287, ft, boerentoren, in, antwerp, belgium, built, in, 1932, the, 66, m, 217, ft, prudential, building, in, warsaw, poland, built, in, 1934, and, the, 108, m, 354, ft, torre, piacentini, in, genoa, italy, built, in, 1940, after, an, early, competition, between, new, york, city, and, chicago, for, the, world, s, tallest, building, new, york, took, the, lead, by, 1895, with, the, completion, of, the, 103, m, 338, ft, tall, american, surety, building, leaving, new, york, with, the, title, of, the, world, s, tallest, building, for, many, years, modern, skyscrapers, are, built, with, steel, or, reinforced, concrete, frameworks, and, curtain, walls, of, glass, or, polished, stone, they, use, mechanical, equipment, such, as, water, pumps, and, elevators, since, the, 1960s, according, to, the, ctbuh, the, skyscraper, has, been, reoriented, away, from, a, symbol, for, north, american, corporate, power, to, instead, communicate, a, city, or, nation, s, place, in, the, world, skyscraper, construction, entered, a, three, decades, long, era, of, stagnation, in, 1930, due, to, the, great, depression, and, then, world, war, ii, shortly, after, the, war, ended, russia, began, construction, on, a, series, of, skyscrapers, in, moscow, seven, dubbed, the, seven, sisters, were, built, between, 1947, and, 1953, and, one, the, main, building, of, moscow, state, university, was, the, tallest, building, in, europe, for, nearly, four, decades, 1953, 1990, other, skyscrapers, in, the, style, of, socialist, classicism, were, erected, in, east, germany, frankfurter, tor, poland, pkin, ukraine, hotel, moscow, latvia, academy, of, sciences, and, other, eastern, bloc, countries, western, european, countries, also, began, to, permit, taller, skyscrapers, during, the, years, immediately, following, world, war, ii, early, examples, include, edificio, espa, a, spain, and, torre, breda, italy, from, the, 1930s, onward, skyscrapers, began, to, appear, in, various, cities, in, east, and, southeast, asia, as, well, as, in, latin, america, finally, they, also, began, to, be, constructed, in, cities, in, africa, the, middle, east, south, asia, and, oceania, from, the, late, 1950s, skyscraper, projects, after, world, war, ii, typically, rejected, the, classical, designs, of, the, early, skyscrapers, instead, embracing, the, uniform, international, style, many, older, skyscrapers, were, redesigned, to, suit, contemporary, tastes, or, even, demolished, such, as, new, york, s, singer, building, once, the, world, s, tallest, skyscraper, german, american, architect, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, became, one, of, the, world, s, most, renowned, architects, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, he, conceived, the, glass, fa, ade, skyscraper, and, along, with, norwegian, fred, severud, designed, the, seagram, building, in, 1958, a, skyscraper, that, is, often, regarded, as, the, pinnacle, of, modernist, high, rise, architecture, skyscraper, construction, surged, throughout, the, 1960s, the, impetus, behind, the, upswing, was, a, series, of, transformative, innovations, which, made, it, possible, for, people, to, live, and, work, in, cities, in, the, sky, in, the, early, 1960s, bangladeshi, american, structural, engineer, fazlur, rahman, khan, considered, the, father, of, tubular, designs, for, high, rises, discovered, that, the, dominating, rigid, steel, frame, structure, was, not, the, only, system, apt, for, tall, buildings, marking, a, new, era, of, skyscraper, construction, in, terms, of, multiple, structural, systems, his, central, innovation, in, skyscraper, design, and, construction, was, the, concept, of, the, tube, structural, system, including, the, framed, tube, trussed, tube, and, bundled, tube, his, tube, concept, using, all, the, exterior, wall, perimeter, structure, of, a, building, to, simulate, a, thin, walled, tube, revolutionized, tall, building, design, these, systems, allow, greater, economic, efficiency, and, also, allow, skyscrapers, to, take, on, various, shapes, no, longer, needing, to, be, rectangular, and, box, shaped, the, first, building, to, employ, the, tube, structure, was, the, chestnut, de, witt, apartment, building, considered, to, be, a, major, development, in, modern, architecture, these, new, designs, opened, an, economic, door, for, contractors, engineers, architects, and, investors, providing, vast, amounts, of, real, estate, space, on, minimal, plots, of, land, over, the, next, fifteen, years, many, towers, were, built, by, fazlur, rahman, khan, and, the, second, chicago, school, including, the, hundred, story, john, hancock, center, and, the, massive, 442, m, 1, 450, ft, willis, tower, other, pioneers, of, this, field, include, hal, iyengar, william, lemessurier, and, minoru, yamasaki, the, architect, of, the, world, trade, center, many, buildings, designed, in, the, 70s, lacked, a, particular, style, and, recalled, ornamentation, from, earlier, buildings, designed, before, the, 50s, these, design, plans, ignored, the, environment, and, loaded, structures, with, decorative, elements, and, extravagant, finishes, this, approach, to, design, was, opposed, by, fazlur, khan, and, he, considered, the, designs, to, be, whimsical, rather, than, rational, moreover, he, considered, the, work, to, be, a, waste, of, precious, natural, resources, khan, s, work, promoted, structures, integrated, with, architecture, and, the, least, use, of, material, resulting, in, the, smallest, impact, on, the, environment, the, next, era, of, skyscrapers, will, focus, on, the, environment, including, performance, of, structures, types, of, material, construction, practices, absolute, minimal, use, of, materials, natural, resources, embodied, energy, within, the, structures, and, more, importantly, a, holistically, integrated, building, systems, approach, modern, building, practices, regarding, supertall, structures, have, led, to, the, study, of, vanity, height, vanity, height, according, to, the, ctbuh, is, the, distance, between, the, highest, floor, and, its, architectural, top, excluding, antennae, flagpole, or, other, functional, extensions, vanity, height, first, appeared, in, new, york, city, skyscrapers, as, early, as, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, but, supertall, buildings, have, relied, on, such, uninhabitable, extensions, for, on, average, 30, of, their, height, raising, potential, definitional, and, sustainability, issues, the, current, era, of, skyscrapers, focuses, on, sustainability, its, built, and, natural, environments, including, the, performance, of, structures, types, of, materials, construction, practices, absolute, minimal, use, of, materials, and, natural, resources, energy, within, the, structure, and, a, holistically, integrated, building, systems, approach, leed, is, a, current, green, building, standard, architecturally, with, the, movements, of, postmodernism, new, urbanism, and, new, classical, architecture, that, established, since, the, 1980s, a, more, classical, approach, came, back, to, global, skyscraper, design, that, remains, popular, today, examples, are, the, wells, fargo, center, nbc, tower, parkview, square, 30, park, place, the, messeturm, the, iconic, petronas, towers, and, jin, mao, tower, other, contemporary, styles, and, movements, in, skyscraper, design, include, organic, sustainable, neo, futurist, structuralist, high, tech, deconstructivist, blob, digital, streamline, novelty, critical, regionalist, vernacular, neo, art, deco, and, neohistorist, also, known, as, revivalist, 3, september, is, the, global, commemorative, day, for, skyscrapers, called, skyscraper, day, new, york, city, developers, competed, among, themselves, with, successively, taller, buildings, claiming, the, title, of, world, s, tallest, in, the, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, culminating, with, the, completion, of, the, 318, 9, m, 1, 046, ft, chrysler, building, in, 1930, and, the, 443, 2, m, 1, 454, ft, empire, state, building, in, 1931, the, world, s, tallest, building, for, forty, years, the, first, completed, 417, m, 1, 368, ft, tall, world, trade, center, tower, became, the, world, s, tallest, building, in, 1972, however, it, was, overtaken, by, the, sears, tower, now, willis, tower, in, chicago, within, two, years, the, 442, m, 1, 450, ft, tall, sears, tower, stood, as, the, world, s, tallest, building, for, 24, years, from, 1974, until, 1998, until, it, was, edged, out, by, 452, m, 1, 483, ft, petronas, twin, towers, in, kuala, lumpur, which, held, the, title, for, six, years, the, design, and, construction, of, skyscrapers, involves, creating, safe, habitable, spaces, in, very, tall, buildings, the, buildings, must, support, their, weight, resist, wind, and, earthquakes, and, protect, occupants, from, fire, yet, they, must, also, be, conveniently, accessible, even, on, the, upper, floors, and, provide, utilities, and, a, comfortable, climate, for, the, occupants, the, problems, posed, in, skyscraper, design, are, considered, among, the, most, complex, encountered, given, the, balances, required, between, economics, engineering, and, construction, management, one, common, feature, of, skyscrapers, is, a, steel, framework, from, which, curtain, walls, are, suspended, rather, than, load, bearing, walls, of, conventional, construction, most, skyscrapers, have, a, steel, frame, that, enables, them, to, be, built, taller, than, typical, load, bearing, walls, of, reinforced, concrete, skyscrapers, usually, have, a, particularly, small, surface, area, of, what, are, conventionally, thought, of, as, walls, because, the, walls, are, not, load, bearing, most, skyscrapers, are, characterized, by, surface, areas, of, windows, made, possible, by, the, concept, of, steel, frame, and, curtain, wall, however, skyscrapers, can, also, have, curtain, walls, that, mimic, conventional, walls, and, have, a, small, surface, area, of, windows, the, concept, of, a, skyscraper, is, a, product, of, the, industrialized, age, made, possible, by, cheap, fossil, fuel, derived, energy, and, industrially, refined, raw, materials, such, as, steel, and, concrete, the, construction, of, skyscrapers, was, enabled, by, steel, frame, construction, that, surpassed, brick, and, mortar, construction, starting, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, and, finally, surpassing, it, in, the, 20th, century, together, with, reinforced, concrete, construction, as, the, price, of, steel, decreased, and, labor, costs, increased, the, steel, frames, become, inefficient, and, uneconomic, for, supertall, buildings, as, usable, floor, space, is, reduced, for, progressively, larger, supporting, columns, since, about, 1960, tubular, designs, have, been, used, for, high, rises, this, reduces, the, usage, of, material, more, efficient, in, economic, terms, willis, tower, uses, a, third, less, steel, than, the, empire, state, building, yet, allows, greater, height, it, allows, fewer, interior, columns, and, so, creates, more, usable, floor, space, it, further, enables, buildings, to, take, on, various, shapes, elevators, are, characteristic, to, skyscrapers, in, 1852, elisha, otis, introduced, the, safety, elevator, allowing, convenient, and, safe, passenger, movement, to, upper, floors, another, crucial, development, was, the, use, of, a, steel, frame, instead, of, stone, or, brick, otherwise, the, walls, on, the, lower, floors, on, a, tall, building, would, be, too, thick, to, be, practical, today, major, manufacturers, of, elevators, include, otis, thyssenkrupp, schindler, and, kone, advances, in, construction, techniques, have, allowed, skyscrapers, to, narrow, in, width, while, increasing, in, height, some, of, these, new, techniques, include, mass, dampers, to, reduce, vibrations, and, swaying, and, gaps, to, allow, air, to, pass, through, reducing, wind, shear, good, structural, design, is, important, in, most, building, design, but, particularly, for, skyscrapers, since, even, a, small, chance, of, catastrophic, failure, is, unacceptable, given, the, tremendous, damage, such, failure, would, cause, this, presents, a, paradox, to, civil, engineers, the, only, way, to, assure, a, lack, of, failure, is, to, test, for, all, modes, of, failure, in, both, the, laboratory, and, the, real, world, but, the, only, way, to, know, of, all, modes, of, failure, is, to, learn, from, previous, failures, thus, no, engineer, can, be, absolutely, sure, that, a, given, structure, will, resist, all, loadings, that, could, cause, failure, instead, one, can, only, have, large, enough, margins, of, safety, such, that, a, failure, is, acceptably, unlikely, when, buildings, do, fail, engineers, question, whether, the, failure, was, due, to, some, lack, of, foresight, or, due, to, some, unknowable, factor, the, load, a, skyscraper, experiences, is, largely, from, the, force, of, the, building, material, itself, in, most, building, designs, the, weight, of, the, structure, is, much, larger, than, the, weight, of, the, material, that, it, will, support, beyond, its, own, weight, in, technical, terms, the, dead, load, the, load, of, the, structure, is, larger, than, the, live, load, the, weight, of, things, in, the, structure, people, furniture, vehicles, etc, as, such, the, amount, of, structural, material, required, within, the, lower, levels, of, a, skyscraper, will, be, much, larger, than, the, material, required, within, higher, levels, this, is, not, always, visually, apparent, the, empire, state, building, s, setbacks, are, actually, a, result, of, the, building, code, at, the, time, 1916, zoning, resolution, and, were, not, structurally, required, on, the, other, hand, john, hancock, center, s, shape, is, uniquely, the, result, of, how, it, supports, loads, vertical, supports, can, come, in, several, types, among, which, the, most, common, for, skyscrapers, can, be, categorized, as, steel, frames, concrete, cores, tube, within, tube, design, and, shear, walls, the, wind, loading, on, a, skyscraper, is, also, considerable, in, fact, the, lateral, wind, load, imposed, on, supertall, structures, is, generally, the, governing, factor, in, the, structural, design, wind, pressure, increases, with, height, so, for, very, tall, buildings, the, loads, associated, with, wind, are, larger, than, dead, or, live, loads, other, vertical, and, horizontal, loading, factors, come, from, varied, unpredictable, sources, such, as, earthquakes, by, 1895, steel, had, replaced, cast, iron, as, skyscrapers, structural, material, its, malleability, allowed, it, to, be, formed, into, a, variety, of, shapes, and, it, could, be, riveted, ensuring, strong, connections, the, simplicity, of, a, steel, frame, eliminated, the, inefficient, part, of, a, shear, wall, the, central, portion, and, consolidated, support, members, in, a, much, stronger, fashion, by, allowing, both, horizontal, and, vertical, supports, throughout, among, steel, s, drawbacks, is, that, as, more, material, must, be, supported, as, height, increases, the, distance, between, supporting, members, must, decrease, which, in, turn, increases, the, amount, of, material, that, must, be, supported, this, becomes, inefficient, and, uneconomic, for, buildings, above, 40, stories, tall, as, usable, floor, spaces, are, reduced, for, supporting, column, and, due, to, more, usage, of, steel, a, new, structural, system, of, framed, tubes, was, developed, by, fazlur, rahman, khan, in, 1963, the, framed, tube, structure, is, defined, as, a, three, dimensional, space, structure, composed, of, three, four, or, possibly, more, frames, braced, frames, or, shear, walls, joined, at, or, near, their, edges, to, form, a, vertical, tube, like, structural, system, capable, of, resisting, lateral, forces, in, any, direction, by, cantilevering, from, the, foundation, closely, spaced, interconnected, exterior, columns, form, the, tube, horizontal, loads, primarily, wind, are, supported, by, the, structure, as, a, whole, framed, tubes, allow, fewer, interior, columns, and, so, create, more, usable, floor, space, and, about, half, the, exterior, surface, is, available, for, windows, where, larger, openings, like, garage, doors, are, required, the, tube, frame, must, be, interrupted, with, transfer, girders, used, to, maintain, structural, integrity, tube, structures, cut, down, costs, at, the, same, time, allowing, buildings, to, reach, greater, heights, concrete, tube, frame, construction, was, first, used, in, the, dewitt, chestnut, apartment, building, completed, in, chicago, in, 1963, and, soon, after, in, the, john, hancock, center, and, world, trade, center, the, tubular, systems, are, fundamental, to, tall, building, design, most, buildings, over, 40, stories, constructed, since, the, 1960s, now, use, a, tube, design, derived, from, khan, s, structural, engineering, principles, examples, including, the, construction, of, the, world, trade, center, aon, center, petronas, towers, jin, mao, building, and, most, other, supertall, skyscrapers, since, the, 1960s, the, strong, influence, of, tube, structure, design, is, also, evident, in, the, construction, of, the, current, tallest, skyscraper, the, burj, khalifa, which, uses, a, buttressed, core, trussed, tube, and, x, bracing, khan, pioneered, several, other, variations, of, the, tube, structure, design, one, of, these, was, the, concept, of, x, bracing, or, the, trussed, tube, first, employed, for, the, john, hancock, center, this, concept, reduced, the, lateral, load, on, the, building, by, transferring, the, load, into, the, exterior, columns, this, allows, for, a, reduced, need, for, interior, columns, thus, creating, more, floor, space, this, concept, can, be, seen, in, the, john, hancock, center, designed, in, 1965, and, completed, in, 1969, one, of, the, most, famous, buildings, of, the, structural, expressionist, style, the, skyscraper, s, distinctive, x, bracing, exterior, is, actually, a, hint, that, the, structure, s, skin, is, indeed, part, of, its, tubular, system, this, idea, is, one, of, the, architectural, techniques, the, building, used, to, climb, to, record, heights, the, tubular, system, is, essentially, the, spine, that, helps, the, building, stand, upright, during, wind, and, earthquake, loads, this, x, bracing, allows, for, both, higher, performance, from, tall, structures, and, the, ability, to, open, up, the, inside, floorplan, and, usable, floor, space, if, the, architect, desires, the, john, hancock, center, was, far, more, efficient, than, earlier, steel, frame, structures, where, the, empire, state, building, 1931, required, about, 206, kilograms, of, steel, per, square, metre, and, 28, liberty, street, 1961, required, 275, the, john, hancock, center, required, only, 145, the, trussed, tube, concept, was, applied, to, many, later, skyscrapers, including, the, onterie, center, citigroup, center, and, bank, of, china, tower, bundled, tube, an, important, variation, on, the, tube, frame, is, the, bundled, tube, which, uses, several, interconnected, tube, frames, the, willis, tower, in, chicago, used, this, design, employing, nine, tubes, of, varying, height, to, achieve, its, distinct, appearance, the, bundled, tube, structure, meant, that, buildings, no, longer, need, be, boxlike, in, appearance, they, could, become, sculpture, tube, in, tube, tube, in, tube, system, takes, advantage, of, core, shear, wall, tubes, in, addition, to, exterior, tubes, the, inner, tube, and, outer, tube, work, together, to, resist, gravity, loads, and, lateral, loads, and, to, provide, additional, rigidity, to, the, structure, to, prevent, significant, deflections, at, the, top, this, design, was, first, used, in, one, shell, plaza, later, buildings, to, use, this, structural, system, include, the, petronas, towers, outrigger, and, belt, truss, the, outrigger, and, belt, truss, system, is, a, lateral, load, resisting, system, in, which, the, tube, structure, is, connected, to, the, central, core, wall, with, very, stiff, outriggers, and, belt, trusses, at, one, or, more, levels, bhp, house, was, the, first, building, to, use, this, structural, system, followed, by, the, first, wisconsin, center, since, renamed, u, s, bank, center, in, milwaukee, the, center, rises, 601, feet, with, three, belt, trusses, at, the, bottom, middle, and, top, of, the, building, the, exposed, belt, trusses, serve, aesthetic, and, structural, purposes, later, buildings, to, use, this, include, shanghai, world, financial, center, concrete, tube, structures, the, last, major, buildings, engineered, by, khan, were, the, one, magnificent, mile, and, onterie, center, in, chicago, which, employed, his, bundled, tube, and, trussed, tube, system, designs, respectively, in, contrast, to, his, earlier, buildings, which, were, mainly, steel, his, last, two, buildings, were, concrete, his, earlier, dewitt, chestnut, apartments, building, built, in, 1963, in, chicago, was, also, a, concrete, building, with, a, tube, structure, trump, tower, in, new, york, city, is, also, another, example, that, adapted, this, system, shear, wall, frame, interaction, system, khan, developed, the, shear, wall, frame, interaction, system, for, mid, high, rise, buildings, this, structural, system, uses, combinations, of, shear, walls, and, frames, designed, to, resist, lateral, forces, the, first, building, to, use, this, structural, system, was, the, 35, stories, brunswick, building, the, brunswick, building, today, known, as, the, cook, county, administration, building, was, completed, in, 1965, and, became, the, tallest, reinforced, concrete, structure, of, its, time, the, structural, system, of, brunswick, building, consists, of, a, concrete, shear, wall, core, surrounded, by, an, outer, concrete, frame, of, columns, and, spandrels, apartment, buildings, up, to, 70, stories, high, have, successfully, used, this, concept, the, invention, of, the, elevator, was, a, precondition, for, the, invention, of, skyscrapers, given, that, most, people, would, not, or, could, not, climb, more, than, a, few, flights, of, stairs, at, a, time, the, elevators, in, a, skyscraper, are, not, simply, a, necessary, utility, like, running, water, and, electricity, but, are, in, fact, closely, related, to, the, design, of, the, whole, structure, a, taller, building, requires, more, elevators, to, service, the, additional, floors, but, the, elevator, shafts, consume, valuable, floor, space, if, the, service, core, which, contains, the, elevator, shafts, becomes, too, big, it, can, reduce, the, profitability, of, the, building, architects, must, therefore, balance, the, value, gained, by, adding, height, against, the, value, lost, to, the, expanding, service, core, many, tall, buildings, use, elevators, in, a, non, standard, configuration, to, reduce, their, footprint, buildings, such, as, the, former, world, trade, center, towers, and, chicago, s, john, hancock, center, use, sky, lobbies, where, express, elevators, take, passengers, to, upper, floors, which, serve, as, the, base, for, local, elevators, this, allows, architects, and, engineers, to, place, elevator, shafts, on, top, of, each, other, saving, space, sky, lobbies, and, express, elevators, take, up, a, significant, amount, of, space, however, and, add, to, the, amount, of, time, spent, commuting, between, floors, other, buildings, such, as, the, petronas, towers, use, double, deck, elevators, allowing, more, people, to, fit, in, a, single, elevator, and, reaching, two, floors, at, every, stop, it, is, possible, to, use, even, more, than, two, levels, on, an, elevator, although, this, has, never, been, done, the, main, problem, with, double, deck, elevators, is, that, they, cause, everyone, in, the, elevator, to, stop, when, only, person, on, one, level, needs, to, get, off, at, a, given, floor, buildings, with, sky, lobbies, include, the, world, trade, center, petronas, twin, towers, willis, tower, and, taipei, 101, the, 44th, floor, sky, lobby, of, the, john, hancock, center, also, featured, the, first, high, rise, indoor, swimming, pool, which, remains, the, highest, in, the, united, states, skyscrapers, are, usually, situated, in, city, centres, where, the, price, of, land, is, high, constructing, a, skyscraper, becomes, justified, if, the, price, of, land, is, so, high, that, it, makes, economic, sense, to, build, upward, as, to, minimize, the, cost, of, the, land, per, the, total, floor, area, of, a, building, thus, the, construction, of, skyscrapers, is, dictated, by, economics, and, results, in, skyscrapers, in, a, certain, part, of, a, large, city, unless, a, building, code, restricts, the, height, of, buildings, skyscrapers, are, rarely, seen, in, small, cities, and, they, are, characteristic, of, large, cities, because, of, the, critical, importance, of, high, land, prices, for, the, construction, of, skyscrapers, usually, only, office, commercial, and, hotel, users, can, afford, the, rents, in, the, city, center, and, thus, most, tenants, of, skyscrapers, are, of, these, classes, today, skyscrapers, are, an, increasingly, common, sight, where, land, is, expensive, as, in, the, centres, of, big, cities, because, they, provide, such, a, high, ratio, of, rentable, floor, space, per, unit, area, of, land, another, disadvantage, of, very, high, skyscrapers, is, the, loss, of, usable, floorspace, as, many, elevator, shafts, are, needed, to, enable, performant, vertical, travelling, this, led, to, the, introduction, of, express, lifts, and, sky, lobbies, where, transfer, to, slower, distribution, lifts, can, be, done, constructing, a, single, skyscraper, requires, large, quantities, of, materials, like, steel, concrete, and, glass, and, these, materials, represent, significant, embodied, energy, skyscrapers, are, thus, material, and, energy, intensive, buildings, skyscrapers, have, considerable, mass, requiring, a, stronger, foundation, than, a, shorter, lighter, building, in, construction, building, materials, must, be, lifted, to, the, top, of, a, skyscraper, during, construction, requiring, more, energy, than, would, be, necessary, at, lower, heights, furthermore, a, skyscraper, consumes, much, electricity, because, potable, and, non, potable, water, have, to, be, pumped, to, the, highest, occupied, floors, skyscrapers, are, usually, designed, to, be, mechanically, ventilated, elevators, are, generally, used, instead, of, stairs, and, electric, lights, are, needed, in, rooms, far, from, the, windows, and, windowless, spaces, such, as, elevators, bathrooms, and, stairwells, skyscrapers, can, be, artificially, lit, and, the, energy, requirements, can, be, covered, by, renewable, energy, or, other, electricity, generation, with, low, greenhouse, gas, emissions, heating, and, cooling, of, skyscrapers, can, be, efficient, because, of, centralized, hvac, systems, heat, radiation, blocking, windows, and, small, surface, area, of, the, building, there, is, leadership, in, energy, and, environmental, design, leed, certification, for, skyscrapers, for, example, the, empire, state, building, received, a, gold, leadership, in, energy, and, environmental, design, rating, in, september, 2011, and, the, empire, state, building, is, the, tallest, leed, certified, building, in, the, united, states, proving, that, skyscrapers, can, be, environmentally, friendly, the, gherkin, in, london, the, united, kingdom, is, another, example, of, an, environmentally, friendly, skyscraper, in, the, lower, levels, of, a, skyscraper, a, larger, percentage, of, the, building, floor, area, must, be, devoted, to, the, building, structure, and, services, than, is, required, for, lower, buildings, in, low, rise, structures, the, support, rooms, chillers, transformers, boilers, pumps, and, air, handling, units, can, be, put, in, basements, or, roof, space, areas, which, have, low, rental, value, there, is, however, a, limit, to, how, far, this, plant, can, be, located, from, the, area, it, serves, the, farther, away, it, is, the, larger, the, risers, for, ducts, and, pipes, from, this, plant, to, the, floors, they, serve, and, the, more, floor, area, these, risers, take, in, practice, this, means, that, in, highrise, buildings, this, plant, is, located, on, plant, levels, at, intervals, up, the, building, the, building, sector, accounts, for, approximately, 50, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, with, operational, energy, accounting, for, 80, 90, of, building, related, energy, use, operational, energy, use, is, affected, by, the, magnitude, of, conduction, between, the, interior, and, exterior, convection, from, infiltrating, air, and, radiation, through, glazing, the, extent, to, which, these, factors, affect, the, operational, energy, vary, depending, on, the, microclimate, of, the, skyscraper, with, increased, wind, speeds, as, the, height, of, the, skyscraper, increases, and, a, decrease, in, the, dry, bulb, temperature, as, the, altitude, increases, for, example, when, moving, from, 1, 5, meters, to, 284, meters, the, dry, bulb, temperature, decreased, by, 1, 85, c, while, the, wind, speeds, increased, from, 2, 46, meters, per, seconds, to, 7, 75, meters, per, second, which, led, to, a, 2, 4, decrease, in, summer, cooling, in, reference, to, the, freedom, tower, in, new, york, city, however, for, the, same, building, it, was, found, that, the, annual, energy, use, intensity, was, 9, 26, higher, because, of, the, lack, of, shading, at, high, altitudes, which, increased, the, cooling, loads, for, the, remainder, of, the, year, while, a, combination, of, temperature, wind, shading, and, the, effects, of, reflections, led, to, a, combined, 13, 13, increase, in, annual, energy, use, intensity, in, a, study, performed, by, leung, and, ray, in, 2013, it, was, found, that, the, average, energy, use, intensity, of, a, structure, with, between, 0, and, 9, floors, was, approximately, 80, kbtu, ft, yr, while, the, energy, use, intensity, of, a, structure, with, more, than, 50, floors, was, about, 117, kbtu, ft, yr, refer, to, figure, 1, to, see, the, breakdown, of, how, intermediate, heights, affect, the, energy, use, intensity, the, slight, decrease, in, energy, use, intensity, over, 30, 39, floors, can, be, attributed, to, the, fact, that, the, increase, in, pressure, within, the, heating, cooling, and, water, distribution, systems, levels, out, at, a, point, between, 40, and, 49, floors, and, the, energy, savings, due, to, the, microclimate, of, higher, floors, are, able, to, be, seen, there, is, a, gap, in, data, in, which, another, study, looking, at, the, same, information, but, for, taller, buildings, is, needed, a, portion, of, the, operational, energy, increase, in, tall, buildings, is, related, to, the, usage, of, elevators, because, the, distance, traveled, and, the, speed, at, which, they, travel, increases, as, the, height, of, the, building, increases, between, 5, and, 25, of, the, total, energy, consumed, in, a, tall, building, is, from, the, use, of, elevators, as, the, height, of, the, building, increases, it, is, also, more, inefficient, because, of, the, presence, of, higher, drag, and, friction, losses, the, embodied, energy, associated, with, the, construction, of, skyscrapers, varies, based, on, the, materials, used, embodied, energy, is, quantified, per, unit, of, material, skyscrapers, inherently, have, higher, embodied, energy, than, low, rise, buildings, due, to, the, increase, in, material, used, as, more, floors, are, built, figures, 2, and, 3, compare, the, total, embodied, energy, of, different, floor, types, and, the, unit, embodied, energy, per, floor, type, for, buildings, with, between, 20, and, 70, stories, for, all, floor, types, except, for, steel, concrete, floors, it, was, found, that, after, 60, stories, there, was, a, decrease, in, unit, embodied, energy, but, when, considering, all, floors, there, was, exponential, growth, due, to, a, double, dependence, on, height, the, first, of, which, is, the, relationship, between, an, increase, in, height, leading, to, an, increase, in, the, quantity, of, materials, used, and, the, second, being, the, increase, in, height, leading, to, an, increase, in, size, of, elements, to, increase, the, structural, capacity, of, the, building, a, careful, choice, in, building, materials, can, likely, reduce, the, embodied, energy, without, reducing, the, number, of, floors, constructed, within, the, bounds, presented, similar, to, embodied, energy, the, embodied, carbon, of, a, building, is, dependent, on, the, materials, chosen, for, its, construction, figures, 4, and, 5, show, the, total, embodied, carbon, for, different, structure, types, for, increasing, numbers, of, stories, and, the, embodied, carbon, per, square, meter, of, gross, floor, area, for, the, same, structure, types, as, the, number, of, stories, increases, both, methods, of, measuring, the, embodied, carbon, show, that, there, is, a, point, where, the, embodied, carbon, is, lowest, before, increasing, again, as, the, height, increases, for, the, total, embodied, carbon, it, is, dependent, on, the, structure, type, but, is, either, around, 40, stories, or, approximately, 60, stories, for, the, square, meter, of, gross, floor, area, the, lowest, embodied, carbon, was, found, at, either, 40, stories, or, approximately, 70, stories, in, urban, areas, the, configuration, of, buildings, can, lead, to, exacerbated, wind, patterns, and, an, uneven, dispersion, of, pollutants, when, the, height, of, buildings, surrounding, a, source, of, air, pollution, is, increased, the, size, and, occurrence, of, both, dead, zones, and, hotspots, were, increased, in, areas, where, there, were, almost, no, pollutants, and, high, concentrations, of, pollutants, respectively, figure, 6, depicts, the, progression, of, a, building, f, s, height, increasing, from, 0, 0315, units, in, case, 1, to, 0, 2, units, in, case, 2, to, 0, 6, units, in, case, 3, this, progression, shows, how, as, the, height, of, building, f, increases, the, dispersion, of, pollutants, decreases, but, the, concentration, within, the, building, cluster, increases, the, variation, of, velocity, fields, can, be, affected, by, the, construction, of, new, buildings, as, well, rather, than, solely, the, increase, in, height, as, shown, in, the, figure, as, urban, centers, continue, to, expand, upward, and, outward, the, present, velocity, fields, will, continue, to, trap, polluted, air, close, to, the, tall, buildings, within, the, city, specifically, within, major, cities, a, majority, of, air, pollution, is, derived, from, transportation, whether, it, be, cars, trains, planes, or, boats, as, urban, sprawl, continues, and, pollutants, continue, to, be, emitted, the, air, pollutants, will, continue, to, be, trapped, within, these, urban, centers, different, pollutants, can, be, detrimental, to, human, health, in, different, ways, for, example, particulate, matter, from, vehicular, exhaust, and, power, generation, can, cause, asthma, bronchitis, and, cancer, while, nitrogen, dioxide, from, motor, engine, combustion, processes, can, cause, neurological, disfunction, and, asphyxiation, like, with, all, other, buildings, if, special, measures, are, taken, to, incorporate, sustainable, design, methods, early, on, in, the, design, process, it, is, possible, to, obtain, a, green, building, rating, such, as, a, leadership, in, energy, and, environmental, design, leed, certification, an, integrated, design, approach, is, crucial, in, making, sure, that, design, decisions, that, positively, impact, the, whole, building, are, made, at, the, beginning, of, the, process, because, of, the, massive, scale, of, skyscrapers, the, decisions, made, by, the, design, team, must, take, all, factors, into, account, including, the, buildings, impact, on, the, surrounding, community, the, effect, of, the, building, on, the, direction, in, which, air, and, water, move, and, the, impact, of, the, construction, process, must, be, taken, into, account, there, are, several, design, methods, that, could, be, employed, in, the, construction, of, a, skyscraper, that, would, take, advantage, of, the, height, of, the, building, the, microclimates, that, exist, as, the, height, of, the, building, increases, can, be, taken, advantage, of, to, increase, the, natural, ventilation, decrease, the, cooling, load, and, increase, daylighting, natural, ventilation, can, be, increased, by, utilizing, the, stack, effect, in, which, warm, air, moves, upward, and, increases, the, movement, of, the, air, within, the, building, if, utilizing, the, stack, effect, buildings, must, take, extra, care, to, design, for, fire, separation, techniques, as, the, stack, effect, can, also, exacerbate, the, severity, of, a, fire, skyscrapers, are, considered, to, be, internally, dominated, buildings, because, of, their, size, as, well, as, the, fact, that, a, majority, are, used, as, some, sort, of, office, building, with, high, cooling, loads, due, to, the, microclimate, created, at, the, upper, floors, with, the, increased, wind, speed, and, the, decreased, dry, bulb, temperatures, the, cooling, load, will, naturally, be, reduced, because, of, infiltration, through, the, thermal, envelope, by, taking, advantage, of, the, naturally, cooler, temperatures, at, higher, altitudes, skyscrapers, can, reduce, their, cooling, loads, passively, on, the, other, side, of, this, argument, is, the,
