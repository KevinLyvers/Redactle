a, parachute, is, a, device, used, to, slow, the, motion, of, an, object, through, an, atmosphere, by, creating, drag, or, in, a, ram, air, parachute, aerodynamic, lift, a, major, application, is, to, support, people, for, recreation, or, as, a, safety, device, for, aviators, who, can, exit, from, an, aircraft, at, height, and, descend, safely, to, earth, a, parachute, is, usually, made, of, a, light, strong, fabric, early, parachutes, were, made, of, silk, the, most, common, fabric, today, is, nylon, a, parachute, s, canopy, is, typically, dome, shaped, but, some, are, rectangles, inverted, domes, and, other, shapes, a, variety, of, loads, are, attached, to, parachutes, including, people, food, equipment, space, capsules, and, bombs, in, 852, in, c, rdoba, spain, the, moorish, man, armen, firman, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, fly, by, jumping, from, a, tower, while, wearing, a, large, cloak, it, was, recorded, that, there, was, enough, air, in, the, folds, of, his, cloak, to, prevent, great, injury, when, he, reached, the, ground, the, earliest, evidence, for, the, true, parachute, dates, back, to, the, renaissance, period, the, oldest, parachute, design, appears, in, a, manuscript, from, the, 1470s, attributed, to, taccola, british, library, add, ms, 34113, fol, 200v, showing, a, free, hanging, man, clutching, a, crossbar, frame, attached, to, a, conical, canopy, as, a, safety, measure, four, straps, ran, from, the, ends, of, the, rods, to, a, waist, belt, although, the, surface, area, of, the, parachute, design, appears, to, be, too, small, to, offer, effective, air, resistance, and, the, wooden, base, frame, is, superfluous, and, potentially, harmful, the, basic, concept, of, a, working, parachute, is, apparent, the, design, is, a, marked, improvement, over, another, folio, 189v, which, depicts, a, man, trying, to, break, the, force, of, his, fall, using, two, long, cloth, streamers, fastened, to, two, bars, which, he, grips, with, his, hands, shortly, after, a, more, sophisticated, parachute, was, sketched, by, the, polymath, leonardo, da, vinci, in, his, codex, atlanticus, fol, 381v, dated, to, c, 1485, here, the, scale, of, the, parachute, is, in, a, more, favorable, proportion, to, the, weight, of, the, jumper, a, square, wooden, frame, which, alters, the, shape, of, the, parachute, from, conical, to, pyramidal, held, open, leonardo, s, canopy, it, is, not, known, whether, the, italian, inventor, was, influenced, by, the, earlier, design, but, he, may, have, learned, about, the, idea, through, the, intensive, oral, communication, among, artist, engineers, of, the, time, the, feasibility, of, leonardo, s, pyramidal, design, was, successfully, tested, in, 2000, by, briton, adrian, nicholas, and, again, in, 2008, by, the, swiss, skydiver, olivier, vietti, teppa, according, to, historian, of, technology, lynn, white, these, conical, and, pyramidal, designs, much, more, elaborate, than, early, artistic, jumps, with, rigid, parasols, in, asia, mark, the, origin, of, the, parachute, as, we, know, it, the, croatian, polymath, and, inventor, fausto, veranzio, or, faust, vran, i, 1551, 1617, examined, da, vinci, s, parachute, sketch, and, kept, the, square, frame, but, replaced, the, canopy, with, a, bulging, sail, like, piece, of, cloth, that, he, came, to, realize, decelerates, a, fall, more, effectively, a, now, famous, depiction, of, a, parachute, that, he, dubbed, homo, volans, flying, man, showing, a, man, parachuting, from, a, tower, presumably, st, mark, s, campanile, in, venice, appeared, in, his, book, on, mechanics, machinae, novae, new, machines, published, in, 1615, or, 1616, alongside, a, number, of, other, devices, and, technical, concepts, it, was, once, widely, believed, that, in, 1617, veranzio, then, aged, 65, and, seriously, ill, implemented, his, design, and, tested, the, parachute, by, jumping, from, st, mark, s, campanile, from, a, bridge, nearby, or, from, st, martin, s, cathedral, in, bratislava, various, publications, incorrectly, claimed, the, event, was, documented, some, thirty, years, later, by, john, wilkins, one, of, the, founders, of, and, secretary, of, the, royal, society, in, london, in, his, book, mathematical, magick, or, the, wonders, that, may, be, performed, by, mechanical, geometry, published, in, london, in, 1648, however, wilkins, wrote, about, flying, not, parachutes, and, does, not, mention, veranzio, a, parachute, jump, or, any, event, in, 1617, doubts, about, this, test, which, include, a, lack, of, written, evidence, suggest, it, never, occurred, and, was, instead, a, misreading, of, historical, notes, the, modern, parachute, was, invented, in, the, late, 18th, century, by, louis, s, bastien, lenormand, in, france, who, made, the, first, recorded, public, jump, in, 1783, lenormand, also, sketched, his, device, beforehand, two, years, later, in, 1785, lenormand, coined, the, word, parachute, by, hybridizing, an, italian, prefix, para, an, imperative, form, of, parare, to, avert, defend, resist, guard, shield, or, shroud, from, paro, to, parry, and, chute, the, french, word, for, fall, to, describe, the, aeronautical, device, s, real, function, also, in, 1785, jean, pierre, blanchard, demonstrated, it, as, a, means, of, safely, disembarking, from, a, hot, air, balloon, while, blanchard, s, first, parachute, demonstrations, were, conducted, with, a, dog, as, the, passenger, he, later, claimed, to, have, had, the, opportunity, to, try, it, himself, in, 1793, when, his, hot, air, balloon, ruptured, and, he, used, a, parachute, to, descend, this, event, was, not, witnessed, by, others, on, 12, october, 1799, jeanne, genevi, ve, garnerin, ascended, in, a, gondola, attached, to, a, balloon, at, 900, meters, she, detached, the, gondola, from, the, balloon, and, descended, in, the, gondola, by, parachute, in, doing, so, she, became, the, first, woman, to, parachute, she, went, on, to, complete, many, ascents, and, parachute, descents, in, towns, across, france, and, europe, subsequent, development, of, the, parachute, focused, on, it, becoming, more, compact, while, the, early, parachutes, were, made, of, linen, stretched, over, a, wooden, frame, in, the, late, 1790s, blanchard, began, making, parachutes, from, folded, silk, taking, advantage, of, silk, s, strength, and, light, weight, in, 1797, andr, garnerin, made, the, first, descent, of, a, frameless, parachute, covered, in, silk, in, 1804, j, r, me, lalande, introduced, a, vent, in, the, canopy, to, eliminate, violent, oscillations, in, 1887, park, van, tassel, and, thomas, scott, baldwin, invented, a, parachute, in, san, francisco, california, with, baldwin, making, the, first, successful, parachute, jump, in, the, western, united, states, in, 1907, charles, broadwick, demonstrated, two, key, advances, in, the, parachute, he, used, to, jump, from, hot, air, balloons, at, fairs, he, folded, his, parachute, into, a, backpack, and, the, parachute, was, pulled, from, the, pack, by, a, static, line, attached, to, the, balloon, when, broadwick, jumped, from, the, balloon, the, static, line, became, taut, pulled, the, parachute, from, the, pack, and, then, snapped, in, 1911, a, successful, test, took, place, with, a, dummy, at, the, eiffel, tower, in, paris, the, puppet, s, weight, was, 75, kg, 165, lb, the, parachute, s, weight, was, 21, kg, 46, lb, the, cables, between, the, puppet, and, the, parachute, were, 9, m, 30, ft, long, on, february, 4, 1912, franz, reichelt, jumped, to, his, death, from, the, tower, during, initial, testing, of, his, wearable, parachute, also, in, 1911, grant, morton, made, the, first, parachute, jump, from, an, airplane, a, wright, model, b, piloted, by, phil, parmalee, at, venice, beach, california, morton, s, device, was, of, the, throw, out, type, where, he, held, the, parachute, in, his, arms, as, he, left, the, aircraft, in, the, same, year, 1911, russian, gleb, kotelnikov, invented, the, first, knapsack, parachute, although, hermann, lattemann, and, his, wife, k, the, paulus, had, been, jumping, with, bagged, parachutes, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 19th, century, in, 1912, on, a, road, near, tsarskoye, selo, years, before, it, became, part, of, st, petersburg, kotelnikov, successfully, demonstrated, the, braking, effects, of, a, parachute, by, accelerating, a, russo, balt, automobile, to, its, top, speed, and, then, opening, a, parachute, attached, to, the, back, seat, thus, also, inventing, the, drogue, parachute, on, 1, march, 1912, u, s, army, captain, albert, berry, made, the, first, attached, type, parachute, jump, in, the, united, states, from, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, a, benoist, pusher, while, flying, above, jefferson, barracks, st, louis, missouri, the, jump, utilized, a, parachute, stored, or, housed, in, a, cone, shaped, casing, under, the, airplane, and, attached, to, a, harness, on, the, jumper, s, body, tefan, bani, patented, an, umbrella, like, design, in, 1914, and, sold, or, donated, the, patent, to, the, united, states, military, which, later, modified, his, design, resulting, in, the, first, military, parachute, bani, had, been, the, first, person, to, patent, the, parachute, and, his, design, was, the, first, to, properly, function, in, the, 20th, century, on, june, 21, 1913, georgia, broadwick, became, the, first, woman, to, parachute, jump, from, a, moving, aircraft, doing, so, over, los, angeles, california, in, 1914, while, doing, demonstrations, for, the, u, s, army, broadwick, deployed, her, chute, manually, thus, becoming, the, first, person, to, jump, free, fall, the, first, military, use, of, the, parachute, was, by, artillery, observers, on, tethered, observation, balloons, in, world, war, i, these, were, tempting, targets, for, enemy, fighter, aircraft, though, difficult, to, destroy, due, to, their, heavy, anti, aircraft, defenses, because, it, was, difficult, to, escape, from, them, and, dangerous, when, on, fire, due, to, their, hydrogen, inflation, observers, would, abandon, them, and, descend, by, parachute, as, soon, as, enemy, aircraft, were, seen, the, ground, crew, would, then, attempt, to, retrieve, and, deflate, the, balloon, as, quickly, as, possible, the, main, part, of, the, parachute, was, in, a, bag, suspended, from, the, balloon, with, the, pilot, wearing, only, a, simple, waist, harness, attached, to, the, main, parachute, when, the, balloon, crew, jumped, the, main, part, of, the, parachute, was, pulled, from, the, bag, by, the, crew, s, waist, harness, first, the, shroud, lines, followed, by, the, main, canopy, this, type, of, parachute, was, first, adopted, on, a, large, scale, for, their, observation, balloon, crews, by, the, germans, and, then, later, by, the, british, and, french, while, this, type, of, unit, worked, well, from, balloons, it, had, mixed, results, when, used, on, fixed, wing, aircraft, by, the, germans, where, the, bag, was, stored, in, a, compartment, directly, behind, the, pilot, in, many, instances, where, it, did, not, work, the, shroud, lines, became, entangled, with, the, spinning, aircraft, although, this, type, of, parachute, saved, a, number, of, famous, german, fighter, pilots, including, hermann, g, ring, no, parachutes, were, issued, to, the, crews, of, allied, heavier, than, air, aircraft, it, has, been, claimed, that, the, reason, was, to, avoid, pilots, jumping, from, the, plane, when, hit, rather, than, trying, to, save, the, aircraft, but, air, vice, marshall, arthur, gould, lee, himself, a, pilot, during, the, war, examined, the, british, war, office, files, after, the, war, and, found, no, evidence, of, such, claim, airplane, cockpits, at, that, time, also, were, not, large, enough, to, accommodate, a, pilot, and, a, parachute, since, a, seat, that, would, fit, a, pilot, wearing, a, parachute, would, be, too, large, for, a, pilot, not, wearing, one, this, is, why, the, german, type, was, stowed, in, the, fuselage, rather, than, being, of, the, backpack, type, weight, was, at, the, very, beginning, also, a, consideration, since, planes, had, limited, load, capacity, carrying, a, parachute, impeded, performance, and, reduced, the, useful, offensive, and, fuel, load, in, the, uk, everard, calthrop, a, railway, engineer, and, breeder, of, arab, horses, invented, and, marketed, through, his, aerial, patents, company, a, british, parachute, and, the, guardian, angel, parachute, as, part, of, an, investigation, into, calthrop, s, design, on, 13, january, 1917, test, pilot, clive, franklyn, collett, successfully, jumped, from, a, royal, aircraft, factory, be, 2c, flying, over, orford, ness, experimental, station, at, 180, metres, 590, ft, he, repeated, the, experiment, several, days, later, following, on, from, collett, balloon, officer, thomas, orde, lees, known, as, the, mad, major, successfully, jumped, from, tower, bridge, in, london, which, led, to, the, balloonists, of, the, royal, flying, corps, using, parachutes, though, they, were, issued, for, use, in, aircraft, in, 1911, solomon, lee, van, meter, jr, of, lexington, kentucky, submitted, an, application, for, and, in, july, 1916, received, a, patent, for, a, backpack, style, parachute, the, aviatory, life, buoy, his, self, contained, device, featured, a, revolutionary, quick, release, mechanism, the, ripcord, that, allowed, a, falling, aviator, to, expand, the, canopy, only, when, safely, away, from, the, disabled, aircraft, otto, heinecke, a, german, airship, ground, crewman, designed, a, parachute, which, the, german, air, service, introduced, in, 1918, becoming, the, world, s, first, air, service, to, introduce, a, standard, parachute, schroeder, company, of, berlin, manufactured, heinecke, s, design, the, first, successful, use, of, this, parachute, was, by, leutnant, helmut, steinbrecher, of, jagdstaffel, 46, who, bailed, on, 27, june, 1918, from, his, stricken, fighter, airplane, to, become, the, first, pilot, in, history, to, successfully, do, so, although, many, pilots, were, saved, by, the, heinecke, design, their, efficacy, was, relatively, poor, out, of, the, first, 70, german, airmen, to, bail, out, around, a, third, died, these, fatalities, were, mostly, due, to, the, chute, or, ripcord, becoming, entangled, in, the, airframe, of, their, spinning, aircraft, or, because, of, harness, failure, a, problem, fixed, in, later, versions, the, french, british, american, and, italian, air, services, later, based, their, first, parachute, designs, on, the, heinecke, parachute, to, varying, extents, in, the, uk, sir, frank, mears, who, was, serving, as, a, major, in, the, royal, flying, corps, in, france, kite, balloon, section, registered, a, patent, in, july, 1918, for, a, parachute, with, a, quick, release, buckle, known, as, the, mears, parachute, which, was, in, common, use, from, then, onwards, the, experience, with, parachutes, during, the, war, highlighted, the, need, to, develop, a, design, that, could, be, reliably, used, to, exit, a, disabled, airplane, for, instance, tethered, parachutes, did, not, work, well, when, the, aircraft, was, spinning, after, the, war, major, edward, l, hoffman, of, the, united, states, army, led, an, effort, to, develop, an, improved, parachute, by, bringing, together, the, best, elements, of, multiple, parachute, designs, participants, in, the, effort, included, leslie, irvin, and, james, floyd, smith, the, team, eventually, created, the, airplane, parachute, type, a, this, incorporated, three, key, elements, in, 1919, irvin, successfully, tested, the, parachute, by, jumping, from, an, airplane, the, type, a, parachute, was, put, into, production, and, over, time, saved, a, number, of, lives, the, effort, was, recognized, by, the, awarding, of, the, robert, j, collier, trophy, to, major, edward, l, hoffman, in, 1926, irvin, became, the, first, person, to, make, a, premeditated, free, fall, parachute, jump, from, an, airplane, an, early, brochure, of, the, irvin, air, chute, company, credits, william, o, connor, as, having, become, on, 24, august, 1920, at, mccook, field, near, dayton, ohio, the, first, person, to, be, saved, by, an, irvin, parachute, test, pilot, lt, harold, r, harris, made, another, life, saving, jump, at, mccook, field, on, 20, october, 1922, shortly, after, harris, jump, two, dayton, newspaper, reporters, suggested, the, creation, of, the, caterpillar, club, for, successful, parachute, jumps, from, disabled, aircraft, beginning, with, italy, in, 1927, several, countries, experimented, with, using, parachutes, to, drop, soldiers, behind, enemy, lines, the, regular, soviet, airborne, troops, were, established, as, early, as, 1931, after, a, number, of, experimental, military, mass, jumps, starting, from, 2, august, 1930, earlier, the, same, year, the, first, soviet, mass, jumps, led, to, the, development, of, the, parachuting, sport, in, the, soviet, union, by, the, time, of, world, war, ii, large, airborne, forces, were, trained, and, used, in, surprise, attacks, as, in, the, battles, for, fort, eben, emael, and, the, hague, the, first, large, scale, opposed, landings, of, paratroopers, in, military, history, by, the, germans, this, was, followed, later, in, the, war, by, airborne, assaults, on, a, larger, scale, such, as, the, battle, of, crete, and, operation, market, garden, the, latter, being, the, largest, airborne, military, operation, ever, aircraft, crew, were, routinely, equipped, with, parachutes, for, emergencies, as, well, in, 1937, drag, chutes, were, used, in, aviation, for, the, first, time, by, soviet, airplanes, in, the, arctic, that, were, providing, support, for, the, polar, expeditions, of, the, era, such, as, the, first, drifting, ice, station, north, pole, 1, the, drag, chute, allowed, airplanes, to, land, safely, on, smaller, ice, floes, most, parachutes, were, made, of, silk, until, world, war, ii, cut, off, supplies, from, japan, after, adeline, gray, made, the, first, jump, using, a, nylon, parachute, in, june, 1942, the, industry, switched, to, nylon, today, s, modern, parachutes, are, classified, into, two, categories, ascending, and, descending, canopies, all, ascending, canopies, refer, to, paragliders, built, specifically, to, ascend, and, stay, aloft, as, long, as, possible, other, parachutes, including, ram, air, non, elliptical, are, classified, as, descending, canopies, by, manufacturers, some, modern, parachutes, are, classified, as, semi, rigid, wings, which, are, maneuverable, and, can, make, a, controlled, descent, to, collapse, on, impact, with, the, ground, round, parachutes, are, purely, a, drag, device, that, is, unlike, the, ram, air, types, they, provide, no, lift, and, are, used, in, military, emergency, and, cargo, applications, e, g, airdrops, most, have, large, dome, shaped, canopies, made, from, a, single, layer, of, triangular, cloth, gores, some, skydivers, call, them, jellyfish, chutes, because, of, the, resemblance, to, the, marine, organisms, modern, sports, parachutists, rarely, use, this, type, the, first, round, parachutes, were, simple, flat, circulars, these, early, parachutes, suffered, from, instability, caused, by, oscillations, a, hole, in, the, apex, helped, to, vent, some, air, and, reduce, the, oscillations, many, military, applications, adopted, conical, i, e, cone, shaped, or, parabolic, a, flat, circular, canopy, with, an, extended, skirt, shapes, such, as, the, united, states, army, t, 10, static, line, parachute, a, round, parachute, with, no, holes, in, it, is, more, prone, to, oscillate, and, is, not, considered, to, be, steerable, some, parachutes, have, inverted, dome, shaped, canopies, these, are, primarily, used, for, dropping, non, human, payloads, due, to, their, faster, rate, of, descent, forward, speed, 5, 13, km, h, and, steering, can, be, achieved, by, cuts, in, various, sections, gores, across, the, back, or, by, cutting, four, lines, in, the, back, thereby, modifying, the, canopy, shape, to, allow, air, to, escape, from, the, back, of, the, canopy, providing, limited, forward, speed, other, modifications, sometimes, used, are, cuts, in, various, gores, to, cause, some, of, the, skirt, to, bow, out, turning, is, accomplished, by, forming, the, edges, of, the, modifications, giving, the, parachute, more, speed, from, one, side, of, the, modification, than, the, other, this, gives, the, jumpers, the, ability, to, steer, the, parachute, such, as, the, united, states, army, mc, series, parachutes, enabling, them, to, avoid, obstacles, and, to, turn, into, the, wind, to, minimize, horizontal, speed, at, landing, the, unique, design, characteristics, of, cruciform, parachutes, decrease, oscillation, its, user, swinging, back, and, forth, and, violent, turns, during, descent, this, technology, will, be, used, by, the, united, states, army, as, it, replaces, its, older, t, 10, parachutes, with, t, 11, parachutes, under, a, program, called, advanced, tactical, parachute, system, atps, the, atps, canopy, is, a, highly, modified, version, of, a, cross, cruciform, platform, and, is, square, in, appearance, the, atps, system, will, reduce, the, rate, of, descent, by, 30, percent, from, 21, feet, per, second, 6, 4, m, s, to, 15, 75, feet, per, second, 4, 80, m, s, the, t, 11, is, designed, to, have, an, average, rate, of, descent, 14, slower, than, the, t, 10d, thus, resulting, in, lower, landing, injury, rates, for, jumpers, the, decline, in, the, rate, of, descent, will, reduce, the, impact, energy, by, almost, 25, to, lessen, the, potential, for, injury, a, variation, on, the, round, parachute, is, the, pull, down, apex, parachute, invented, by, a, frenchman, named, pierre, marcel, lemoigne, the, first, widely, used, canopy, of, this, type, was, called, the, para, commander, made, by, the, pioneer, parachute, co, although, there, are, many, other, canopies, with, a, pull, down, apex, produced, in, the, years, thereafter, these, had, minor, differences, in, attempts, to, make, a, higher, performance, rig, such, as, different, venting, configurations, they, are, all, considered, round, parachutes, but, with, suspension, lines, to, the, canopy, apex, that, apply, load, there, and, pull, the, apex, closer, to, the, load, distorting, the, round, shape, into, a, somewhat, flattened, or, lenticular, shape, when, viewed, from, the, side, and, while, called, rounds, they, generally, have, an, elliptical, shape, when, viewed, from, above, or, below, with, the, sides, bulging, out, more, than, the, for, d, and, aft, dimension, the, chord, see, the, lower, photo, to, the, right, and, you, likely, can, ascertain, the, difference, due, to, their, lenticular, shape, and, appropriate, venting, they, have, a, considerably, faster, forward, speed, than, say, a, modified, military, canopy, and, due, to, controllable, rear, facing, vents, in, the, canopy, s, sides, they, also, have, much, snappier, turning, capabilities, though, they, are, decidedly, low, performance, compared, to, today, s, ram, air, rigs, from, about, the, mid, 1960s, to, the, late, 1970s, this, was, the, most, popular, parachute, design, type, for, sport, parachuting, prior, to, this, period, modified, military, rounds, were, generally, used, and, after, ram, air, squares, became, common, note, that, the, use, of, the, word, elliptical, for, these, round, parachutes, is, somewhat, dated, and, may, cause, slight, confusion, since, some, squares, i, e, ram, airs, are, elliptical, nowadays, too, some, designs, with, a, pull, down, apex, have, the, fabric, removed, from, the, apex, to, open, a, hole, through, which, air, can, exit, most, if, not, all, round, canopies, have, at, least, a, small, hole, to, allow, easier, tie, down, for, packing, these, aren, t, considered, annular, giving, the, canopy, an, annular, geometry, this, hole, can, be, very, pronounced, in, some, designs, taking, up, more, space, than, the, parachute, they, also, have, decreased, horizontal, drag, due, to, their, flatter, shape, and, when, combined, with, rear, facing, vents, can, have, considerable, forward, speed, truly, annular, designs, with, a, hole, large, enough, that, the, canopy, can, be, classified, as, ring, shaped, are, uncommon, sport, parachuting, has, experimented, with, the, rogallo, wing, among, other, shapes, and, forms, these, were, usually, an, attempt, to, increase, the, forward, speed, and, reduce, the, landing, speed, offered, by, the, other, options, at, the, time, the, ram, air, parachute, s, development, and, the, subsequent, introduction, of, the, sail, slider, to, slow, deployment, reduced, the, level, of, experimentation, in, the, sport, parachuting, community, the, parachutes, are, also, hard, to, build, ribbon, and, ring, parachutes, have, similarities, to, annular, designs, they, are, frequently, designed, to, deploy, at, supersonic, speeds, a, conventional, parachute, would, instantly, burst, upon, opening, and, be, shredded, at, such, speeds, ribbon, parachutes, have, a, ring, shaped, canopy, often, with, a, large, hole, in, the, centre, to, release, the, pressure, sometimes, the, ring, is, broken, into, ribbons, connected, by, ropes, to, leak, air, even, more, these, large, leaks, lower, the, stress, on, the, parachute, so, it, does, not, burst, or, shred, when, it, opens, ribbon, parachutes, made, of, kevlar, are, used, on, nuclear, bombs, such, as, the, b61, and, b83, the, principle, of, the, ram, air, multicell, airfoil, was, conceived, in, 1963, by, canadian, domina, dom, c, jalbert, but, serious, problems, had, to, be, solved, before, a, ram, air, canopy, could, be, marketed, to, the, sport, parachuting, community, ram, air, parafoils, are, steerable, as, are, most, canopies, used, for, sport, parachuting, and, have, two, layers, of, fabric, top, and, bottom, connected, by, airfoil, shaped, fabric, ribs, to, form, cells, the, cells, fill, with, higher, pressure, air, from, vents, that, face, forward, on, the, leading, edge, of, the, airfoil, the, fabric, is, shaped, and, the, parachute, lines, trimmed, under, load, such, that, the, ballooning, fabric, inflates, into, an, airfoil, shape, this, airfoil, is, sometimes, maintained, by, use, of, fabric, one, way, valves, called, airlocks, the, first, jump, of, this, canopy, a, jalbert, parafoil, was, made, by, international, skydiving, hall, of, fame, member, paul, pop, poppenhager, personal, ram, air, parachutes, are, loosely, divided, into, two, varieties, rectangular, or, tapered, commonly, called, squares, or, ellipticals, respectively, medium, performance, canopies, reserve, base, canopy, formation, and, accuracy, type, are, usually, rectangular, high, performance, ram, air, parachutes, have, a, slightly, tapered, shape, to, their, leading, and, or, trailing, edges, when, viewed, in, plan, form, and, are, known, as, ellipticals, sometimes, all, the, taper, is, on, the, leading, edge, front, and, sometimes, in, the, trailing, edge, tail, ellipticals, are, usually, used, only, by, sport, parachutists, they, often, have, smaller, more, numerous, fabric, cells, and, are, shallower, in, profile, their, canopies, can, be, anywhere, from, slightly, elliptical, to, highly, elliptical, indicating, the, amount, of, taper, in, the, canopy, design, which, is, often, an, indicator, of, the, responsiveness, of, the, canopy, to, control, input, for, a, given, wing, loading, and, of, the, level, of, experience, required, to, pilot, the, canopy, safely, the, rectangular, parachute, designs, tend, to, look, like, square, inflatable, air, mattresses, with, open, front, ends, they, are, generally, safer, to, operate, because, they, are, less, prone, to, dive, rapidly, with, relatively, small, control, inputs, they, are, usually, flown, with, lower, wing, loadings, per, square, foot, of, area, and, they, glide, more, slowly, they, typically, have, a, lower, glide, ratio, wing, loading, of, parachutes, is, measured, similarly, to, that, of, aircraft, comparing, exit, weight, to, area, of, parachute, fabric, typical, wing, loading, for, students, accuracy, competitors, and, base, jumpers, is, less, than, 5, kg, per, square, meter, often, 0, 3, kilograms, per, square, meter, or, less, most, student, skydivers, fly, with, wing, loading, below, 5, kg, per, square, meter, most, sport, jumpers, fly, with, wing, loading, between, 5, and, 7, kg, per, square, meter, but, many, interested, in, performance, landings, exceed, this, wing, loading, professional, canopy, pilots, compete, with, wing, loading, of, 10, to, over, 15, kilograms, per, square, meter, while, ram, air, parachutes, with, wing, loading, higher, than, 20, kilograms, per, square, meter, have, been, landed, this, is, strictly, the, realm, of, professional, test, jumpers, smaller, parachutes, tend, to, fly, faster, for, the, same, load, and, ellipticals, respond, faster, to, control, input, therefore, small, elliptical, designs, are, often, chosen, by, experienced, canopy, pilots, for, the, thrilling, flying, they, provide, flying, a, fast, elliptical, requires, much, more, skill, and, experience, fast, ellipticals, are, also, considerably, more, dangerous, to, land, with, high, performance, elliptical, canopies, nuisance, malfunctions, can, be, much, more, serious, than, with, a, square, design, and, may, quickly, escalate, into, emergencies, flying, highly, loaded, elliptical, canopies, is, a, major, contributing, factor, in, many, skydiving, accidents, although, advanced, training, programs, are, helping, to, reduce, this, danger, high, speed, cross, braced, parachutes, such, as, the, velocity, vx, xaos, and, sensei, have, given, birth, to, a, new, branch, of, sport, parachuting, called, swooping, a, race, course, is, set, up, in, the, landing, area, for, expert, pilots, to, measure, the, distance, they, are, able, to, fly, past, the, 1, 5, metre, 4, 9, ft, tall, entry, gate, current, world, records, exceed, 180, metres, 590, ft, aspect, ratio, is, another, way, to, measure, ram, air, parachutes, aspect, ratios, of, parachutes, are, measured, the, same, way, as, aircraft, wings, by, comparing, span, with, chord, low, aspect, ratio, parachutes, i, e, span, 1, 8, times, the, chord, are, now, limited, to, precision, landing, competitions, popular, precision, landing, parachutes, include, jalbert, now, naa, para, foils, and, john, eiff, s, series, of, challenger, classics, while, low, aspect, ratio, parachutes, tend, to, be, extremely, stable, with, gentle, stall, characteristics, they, suffer, from, steep, glide, ratios, and, a, small, tolerance, or, sweet, spot, for, timing, the, landing, flare, because, of, their, predictable, opening, characteristics, parachutes, with, a, medium, aspect, ratio, around, 2, 1, are, widely, used, for, reserves, base, and, canopy, formation, competition, most, medium, aspect, ratio, parachutes, have, seven, cells, high, aspect, ratio, parachutes, have, the, flattest, glide, and, the, largest, tolerance, for, timing, the, landing, flare, but, the, least, predictable, openings, an, aspect, ratio, of, 2, 7, is, about, the, upper, limit, for, parachutes, high, aspect, ratio, canopies, typically, have, nine, or, more, cells, all, reserve, ram, air, parachutes, are, of, the, square, variety, because, of, the, greater, reliability, and, the, less, demanding, handling, characteristics, paragliders, virtually, all, of, which, use, ram, air, canopies, are, more, akin, to, today, s, sport, parachutes, than, say, parachutes, of, the, mid, 1970s, and, earlier, technically, they, are, ascending, parachutes, though, that, term, is, not, used, in, the, paragliding, community, and, they, have, the, same, basic, airfoil, design, of, today, s, square, or, elliptical, sports, parachuting, canopy, but, generally, have, more, sectioned, cells, higher, aspect, ratio, and, a, lower, profile, cell, count, varies, widely, typically, from, the, high, 20s, to, the, 70s, while, aspect, ratio, can, be, 8, or, more, though, aspect, ratio, projected, for, such, a, canopy, might, be, down, at, 6, or, so, both, outrageously, higher, than, a, representative, skydiver, s, parachute, the, wing, span, is, typically, so, great, that, it, s, far, closer, to, a, very, elongated, rectangle, or, ellipse, than, a, square, and, that, term, is, rarely, used, by, paraglider, pilots, similarly, span, might, be, 15, m, with, span, projected, at, 12, m, canopies, are, still, attached, to, the, harness, by, suspension, lines, and, four, or, six, risers, but, they, use, lockable, carabiners, as, the, final, connection, to, the, harness, modern, high, performance, paragliders, often, have, the, cell, openings, closer, to, the, bottom, of, the, leading, edge, and, the, end, cells, might, appear, to, be, closed, both, for, aerodynamic, streamlining, these, apparently, closed, end, cells, are, vented, and, inflated, from, the, adjacent, cells, which, have, venting, in, the, cell, walls, the, main, difference, is, in, paragliders, usage, typically, longer, flights, that, can, last, all, day, and, hundreds, of, kilometres, in, some, cases, the, harness, is, also, quite, different, from, a, parachuting, harness, and, can, vary, dramatically, from, ones, for, the, beginner, which, might, be, just, a, bench, seat, with, nylon, material, and, webbing, to, ensure, the, pilot, is, secure, no, matter, the, position, to, seatboardless, ones, for, high, altitude, and, cross, country, flights, these, are, usually, full, body, cocoon, or, hammock, like, devices, to, include, the, outstretched, legs, called, speedbags, aerocones, etc, to, ensure, aerodynamic, efficiency, and, warmth, in, many, designs, there, will, be, protection, for, the, back, and, shoulder, areas, built, in, and, support, for, a, reserve, canopy, water, container, etc, some, even, have, windshields, because, paragliders, are, made, for, foot, or, ski, launch, they, aren, t, suitable, for, terminal, velocity, openings, and, there, is, no, slider, to, slow, down, an, opening, paraglider, pilots, typically, start, with, an, open, but, uninflated, canopy, to, launch, a, paraglider, one, typically, spreads, out, the, canopy, on, the, ground, to, closely, approximate, an, open, canopy, with, the, suspension, lines, having, little, slack, and, less, tangle, see, more, in, paragliding, depending, on, the, wind, the, pilot, has, three, basic, options, 1, a, running, forward, launch, typically, in, no, wind, or, slight, wind, 2, a, standing, launch, in, ideal, winds, and, 3, a, reverse, launch, in, higher, winds, in, ideal, winds, the, pilot, pulls, on, the, top, risers, to, have, the, wind, inflate, the, cells, and, simply, eases, the, brakes, down, much, like, an, aircraft, s, flaps, and, takes, off, or, if, there, is, no, wind, the, pilot, runs, or, skis, to, make, it, inflate, typically, at, the, edge, of, a, cliff, or, hill, once, the, canopy, is, above, one, s, head, it, s, a, gentle, pull, down, on, both, toggles, in, ideal, winds, a, tow, say, behind, a, vehicle, on, flat, ground, a, continued, run, down, the, hill, etc, ground, handling, in, a, variety, of, winds, is, important, and, there, are, even, canopies, made, strictly, for, that, practice, to, save, on, wear, and, tear, of, more, expensive, canopies, designed, for, say, xc, competition, or, just, recreational, flying, main, parachutes, used, by, skydivers, today, are, designed, to, open, softly, overly, rapid, deployment, was, an, early, problem, with, ram, air, designs, the, primary, innovation, that, slows, the, deployment, of, a, ram, air, canopy, is, the, slider, a, small, rectangular, piece, of, fabric, with, a, grommet, near, each, corner, four, collections, of, lines, go, through, the, grommets, to, the, risers, risers, are, strips, of, webbing, joining, the, harness, and, the, rigging, lines, of, a, parachute, during, deployment, the, slider, slides, down, from, the, canopy, to, just, above, the, risers, the, slider, is, slowed, by, air, resistance, as, it, descends, and, reduces, the, rate, at, which, the, lines, can, spread, this, reduces, the, speed, at, which, the, canopy, can, open, and, inflate, at, the, same, time, the, overall, design, of, a, parachute, still, has, a, significant, influence, on, the, deployment, speed, modern, sport, parachutes, deployment, speeds, vary, considerably, most, modern, parachutes, open, comfortably, but, individual, skydivers, may, prefer, harsher, deployment, the, deployment, process, is, inherently, chaotic, rapid, deployments, can, still, occur, even, with, well, behaved, canopies, on, rare, occasions, deployment, can, even, be, so, rapid, that, the, jumper, suffers, bruising, injury, or, death, reducing, the, amount, of, fabric, decreases, the, air, resistance, this, can, be, done, by, making, the, slider, smaller, inserting, a, mesh, panel, or, cutting, a, hole, in, the, slider, reserve, parachutes, usually, have, a, ripcord, deployment, system, which, was, first, designed, by, theodore, moscicki, but, most, modern, main, parachutes, used, by, sports, parachutists, use, a, form, of, hand, deployed, pilot, chute, a, ripcord, system, pulls, a, closing, pin, sometimes, multiple, pins, which, releases, a, spring, loaded, pilot, chute, and, opens, the, container, the, pilot, chute, is, then, propelled, into, the, air, stream, by, its, spring, then, uses, the, force, generated, by, passing, air, to, extract, a, deployment, bag, containing, the, parachute, canopy, to, which, it, is, attached, via, a, bridle, a, hand, deployed, pilot, chute, once, thrown, into, the, air, stream, pulls, a, closing, pin, on, the, pilot, chute, bridle, to, open, the, container, then, the, same, force, extracts, the, deployment, bag, there, are, variations, on, hand, deployed, pilot, chutes, but, the, system, described, is, the, more, common, throw, out, system, only, the, hand, deployed, pilot, chute, may, be, collapsed, automatically, after, deployment, by, a, kill, line, reducing, the, in, flight, drag, of, the, pilot, chute, on, the, main, canopy, reserves, on, the, other, hand, do, not, retain, their, pilot, chutes, after, deployment, the, reserve, deployment, bag, and, pilot, chute, are, not, connected, to, the, canopy, in, a, reserve, system, this, is, known, as, a, free, bag, configuration, and, the, components, are, sometimes, not, recovered, after, a, reserve, deployment, occasionally, a, pilot, chute, does, not, generate, enough, force, either, to, pull, the, pin, or, to, extract, the, bag, causes, may, be, that, the, pilot, chute, is, caught, in, the, turbulent, wake, of, the, jumper, the, burble, the, closing, loop, holding, the, pin, is, too, tight, or, the, pilot, chute, is, generating, insufficient, force, this, effect, is, known, as, pilot, chute, hesitation, and, if, it, does, not, clear, it, can, lead, to, a, total, malfunction, requiring, reserve, deployment, paratroopers, main, parachutes, are, usually, deployed, by, static, lines, that, release, the, parachute, yet, retain, the, deployment, bag, that, contains, the, parachute, without, relying, on, a, pilot, chute, for, deployment, in, this, configuration, the, deployment, bag, is, known, as, a, direct, bag, system, in, which, the, deployment, is, rapid, consistent, and, reliable, a, parachute, is, carefully, folded, or, packed, to, ensure, that, it, will, open, reliably, if, a, parachute, is, not, packed, properly, it, can, result, in, a, malfunction, where, the, main, parachute, fails, to, deploy, correctly, or, fully, in, the, united, states, and, many, developed, countries, emergency, and, reserve, parachutes, are, packed, by, riggers, who, must, be, trained, and, certified, according, to, legal, standards, sport, skydivers, are, always, trained, to, pack, their, own, primary, main, parachutes, exact, numbers, are, difficult, to, estimate, because, parachute, design, maintenance, loading, packing, technique, and, operator, experience, all, have, a, significant, impact, on, malfunction, rates, approximately, one, in, a, thousand, sport, main, parachute, openings, malfunctions, requiring, the, use, of, the, reserve, parachute, although, some, skydivers, have, many, thousands, of, jumps, and, never, needed, to, use, their, reserve, parachute, reserve, parachutes, are, packed, and, deployed, somewhat, differently, they, are, also, designed, more, conservatively, favouring, reliability, over, responsiveness, and, are, built, and, tested, to, more, exacting, standards, making, them, more, reliable, than, main, parachutes, regulated, inspection, intervals, coupled, with, significantly, less, use, contributes, to, reliability, as, wear, on, some, components, can, adversely, affect, reliability, the, safety, advantage, of, a, reserve, parachute, comes, from, the, small, probability, of, a, main, malfunction, being, multiplied, by, the, even, smaller, probability, of, a, reserve, malfunction, this, yields, an, even, smaller, probability, of, a, double, malfunction, although, there, is, also, a, small, possibility, of, a, malfunctioning, main, parachute, not, being, able, to, be, released, and, thus, interfering, with, the, reserve, parachute, in, the, united, states, the, 2017, average, fatality, rate, is, recorded, to, be, 1, in, 133, 571, jumps, injuries, and, fatalities, in, sport, skydiving, are, possible, even, under, a, fully, functional, main, parachute, such, as, may, occur, if, the, skydiver, makes, an, error, in, judgment, while, flying, the, canopy, which, results, in, a, high, speed, impact, either, with, the, ground, or, with, a, hazard, on, the, ground, which, might, otherwise, have, been, avoided, or, results, in, collision, with, another, skydiver, under, canopy, below, are, listed, the, malfunctions, specific, to, round, parachutes, on, august, 16, 1960, joseph, kittinger, in, the, excelsior, iii, test, jump, set, the, previous, world, record, for, the, highest, parachute, jump, he, jumped, from, a, balloon, at, an, altitude, of, 102, 800, feet, 31, 333, m, which, was, also, a, piloted, balloon, altitude, record, at, the, time, a, small, stabilizer, chute, deployed, successfully, and, kittinger, fell, for, 4, minutes, and, 36, seconds, also, setting, a, still, standing, world, record, for, the, longest, parachute, free, fall, if, falling, with, a, stabilizer, chute, is, counted, as, free, fall, at, an, altitude, of, 17, 500, feet, 5, 300, m, kittinger, opened, his, main, chute, and, landed, safely, in, the, new, mexico, desert, the, whole, descent, took, 13, minutes, and, 45, seconds, during, the, descent, kittinger, experienced, temperatures, as, low, as, 94, f, 70, c, in, the, free, fall, stage, he, reached, a, top, speed, of, 614, mph, 988, km, h, or, 274, m, s, or, mach, 0, 8, according, to, guinness, world, records, yevgeni, andreyev, a, colonel, in, the, soviet, air, force, held, the, official, fai, record, for, the, longest, free, fall, parachute, jump, without, drogue, chute, after, falling, for, 24, 500, m, 80, 380, ft, from, an, altitude, of, 25, 457, m, 83, 523, ft, near, the, city, of, saratov, russia, on, november, 1, 1962, until, broken, by, felix, baumgartner, in, 2012, felix, baumgartner, broke, joseph, kittinger, s, record, on, october, 14, 2012, with, a, jump, from, an, altitude, of, 127, 852, feet, 38, 969, 3, m, and, reaching, speeds, up, to, 833, 9, mph, 1, 342, 0, km, h, or, 372, 8, m, s, or, nearly, mach, 1, 1, kittinger, was, an, advisor, for, baumgartner, s, jump, alan, eustace, made, a, jump, from, the, stratosphere, on, october, 24, 2014, from, an, altitude, of, 135, 889, 108, feet, 41, 419, m, however, because, eustace, s, jump, involved, a, drogue, parachute, while, baumgartner, s, did, not, their, vertical, speed, and, free, fall, distance, records, remain, in, different, record, categories, in, addition, to, the, use, of, a, parachute, to, slow, the, descent, of, a, person, or, object, a, drogue, parachute, is, used, to, aid, horizontal, deceleration, of, a, land, or, air, vehicle, including, fixed, wing, aircraft, and, drag, racers, provide, stability, as, to, assist, certain, types, of, light, aircraft, in, distress, tandem, free, fall, and, as, a, pilot, triggering, deployment, of, a, larger, parachute, parachutes, are, also, used, as, play, equipment
