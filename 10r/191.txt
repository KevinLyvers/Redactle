nuclear, power, is, the, use, of, nuclear, reactions, to, produce, electricity, nuclear, power, can, be, obtained, from, nuclear, fission, nuclear, decay, and, nuclear, fusion, reactions, presently, the, vast, majority, of, electricity, from, nuclear, power, is, produced, by, nuclear, fission, of, uranium, and, plutonium, in, nuclear, power, plants, nuclear, decay, processes, are, used, in, niche, applications, such, as, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, in, some, space, probes, such, as, voyager, 2, generating, electricity, from, fusion, power, remains, the, focus, of, international, research, most, nuclear, power, plants, use, thermal, reactors, with, enriched, uranium, in, a, once, through, fuel, cycle, fuel, is, removed, when, the, percentage, of, neutron, absorbing, atoms, becomes, so, large, that, a, chain, reaction, can, no, longer, be, sustained, typically, three, years, it, is, then, cooled, for, several, years, in, on, site, spent, fuel, pools, before, being, transferred, to, long, term, storage, the, spent, fuel, though, low, in, volume, is, high, level, radioactive, waste, while, its, radioactivity, decreases, exponentially, it, must, be, isolated, from, the, biosphere, for, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, though, newer, technologies, like, fast, reactors, have, the, potential, to, significantly, reduce, this, because, the, spent, fuel, is, still, mostly, fissionable, material, some, countries, e, g, france, and, russia, reprocess, their, spent, fuel, by, extracting, fissile, and, fertile, elements, for, fabrication, in, new, fuel, although, this, process, is, more, expensive, than, producing, new, fuel, from, mined, uranium, all, reactors, breed, some, plutonium, 239, which, is, found, in, the, spent, fuel, and, because, pu, 239, is, the, preferred, material, for, nuclear, weapons, reprocessing, is, seen, as, a, weapon, proliferation, risk, the, first, nuclear, power, plant, was, built, in, the, 1950s, the, global, installed, nuclear, capacity, grew, to, 100, gw, in, the, late, 1970s, and, then, expanded, during, the, 1980s, reaching, 300, gw, by, 1990, the, 1979, three, mile, island, accident, in, the, united, states, and, the, 1986, chernobyl, disaster, in, the, soviet, union, resulted, in, increased, regulation, and, public, opposition, to, nuclear, power, plants, these, factors, along, with, high, cost, of, construction, resulted, in, the, global, installed, capacity, only, increasing, to, 390, gw, by, 2022, these, plants, supplied, 2, 586, terawatt, hours, twh, of, electricity, in, 2019, equivalent, to, about, 10, of, global, electricity, generation, and, were, the, second, largest, low, carbon, power, source, after, hydroelectricity, as, of, august, 2023, there, are, 410, civilian, fission, reactors, in, the, world, with, overall, capacity, of, 369, gw, 57, under, construction, and, 102, planned, with, a, combined, capacity, of, 59, gw, and, 96, gw, respectively, the, united, states, has, the, largest, fleet, of, nuclear, reactors, generating, almost, 800, twh, of, low, carbon, electricity, per, year, with, an, average, capacity, factor, of, 92, the, average, global, capacity, factor, is, 89, most, new, reactors, under, construction, are, generation, iii, reactors, in, asia, proponents, contend, that, nuclear, power, is, a, safe, sustainable, energy, source, that, reduces, carbon, emissions, this, is, because, nuclear, power, generation, causes, one, of, the, lowest, levels, of, fatalities, per, unit, of, energy, generated, compared, to, other, energy, sources, coal, petroleum, natural, gas, and, hydroelectricity, each, have, caused, more, fatalities, per, unit, of, energy, due, to, air, pollution, and, accidents, nuclear, power, plants, also, emit, no, greenhouse, gases, and, result, in, less, life, cycle, carbon, emissions, than, common, renewables, the, radiological, hazards, associated, with, nuclear, power, are, the, primary, motivations, of, the, anti, nuclear, movement, which, contends, that, nuclear, power, poses, many, threats, to, people, and, the, environment, citing, the, potential, for, accidents, like, the, fukushima, nuclear, disaster, in, japan, in, 2011, and, is, too, expensive, slow, to, deploy, when, compared, to, alternative, sustainable, energy, sources, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, occurred, in, 1938, following, over, four, decades, of, work, on, the, science, of, radioactivity, and, the, elaboration, of, new, nuclear, physics, that, described, the, components, of, atoms, soon, after, the, discovery, of, the, fission, process, it, was, realized, that, a, fissioning, nucleus, can, induce, further, nucleus, fissions, thus, inducing, a, self, sustaining, chain, reaction, once, this, was, experimentally, confirmed, in, 1939, scientists, in, many, countries, petitioned, their, governments, for, support, of, nuclear, fission, research, just, on, the, cusp, of, world, war, ii, for, the, development, of, a, nuclear, weapon, in, the, united, states, these, research, efforts, led, to, the, creation, of, the, first, man, made, nuclear, reactor, the, chicago, pile, 1, under, the, stagg, field, stadium, at, the, university, of, chicago, which, achieved, criticality, on, december, 2, 1942, the, reactor, s, development, was, part, of, the, manhattan, project, the, allied, effort, to, create, atomic, bombs, during, world, war, ii, it, led, to, the, building, of, larger, single, purpose, production, reactors, for, the, production, of, weapons, grade, plutonium, for, use, in, the, first, nuclear, weapons, the, united, states, tested, the, first, nuclear, weapon, in, july, 1945, the, trinity, test, with, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, taking, place, one, month, later, despite, the, military, nature, of, the, first, nuclear, devices, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, were, characterized, by, strong, optimism, for, the, potential, of, nuclear, power, to, provide, cheap, and, endless, energy, electricity, was, generated, for, the, first, time, by, a, nuclear, reactor, on, december, 20, 1951, at, the, ebr, i, experimental, station, near, arco, idaho, which, initially, produced, about, 100, kw, in, 1953, american, president, dwight, eisenhower, gave, his, atoms, for, peace, speech, at, the, united, nations, emphasizing, the, need, to, develop, peaceful, uses, of, nuclear, power, quickly, this, was, followed, by, the, atomic, energy, act, of, 1954, which, allowed, rapid, declassification, of, u, s, reactor, technology, and, encouraged, development, by, the, private, sector, the, first, organization, to, develop, practical, nuclear, power, was, the, u, s, navy, with, the, s1w, reactor, for, the, purpose, of, propelling, submarines, and, aircraft, carriers, the, first, nuclear, powered, submarine, uss, nautilus, was, put, to, sea, in, january, 1954, the, s1w, reactor, was, a, pressurized, water, reactor, this, design, was, chosen, because, it, was, simpler, more, compact, and, easier, to, operate, compared, to, alternative, designs, thus, more, suitable, to, be, used, in, submarines, this, decision, would, result, in, the, pwr, being, the, reactor, of, choice, also, for, power, generation, thus, having, a, lasting, impact, on, the, civilian, electricity, market, in, the, years, to, come, on, june, 27, 1954, the, obninsk, nuclear, power, plant, in, the, ussr, became, the, world, s, first, nuclear, power, plant, to, generate, electricity, for, a, power, grid, producing, around, 5, megawatts, of, electric, power, the, world, s, first, commercial, nuclear, power, station, calder, hall, at, windscale, england, was, connected, to, the, national, power, grid, on, 27, august, 1956, in, common, with, a, number, of, other, generation, i, reactors, the, plant, had, the, dual, purpose, of, producing, electricity, and, plutonium, 239, the, latter, for, the, nascent, nuclear, weapons, program, in, britain, the, total, global, installed, nuclear, capacity, initially, rose, relatively, quickly, rising, from, less, than, 1, gigawatt, gw, in, 1960, to, 100, gw, in, the, late, 1970s, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, rising, economic, costs, related, to, extended, construction, times, largely, due, to, regulatory, changes, and, pressure, group, litigation, and, falling, fossil, fuel, prices, made, nuclear, power, plants, then, under, construction, less, attractive, in, the, 1980s, in, the, u, s, and, 1990s, in, europe, the, flat, electric, grid, growth, and, electricity, liberalization, also, made, the, addition, of, large, new, baseload, energy, generators, economically, unattractive, the, 1973, oil, crisis, had, a, significant, effect, on, countries, such, as, france, and, japan, which, had, relied, more, heavily, on, oil, for, electric, generation, to, invest, in, nuclear, power, france, would, construct, 25, nuclear, power, plants, over, the, next, 15, years, and, as, of, 2019, 71, of, french, electricity, was, generated, by, nuclear, power, the, highest, percentage, by, any, nation, in, the, world, some, local, opposition, to, nuclear, power, emerged, in, the, united, states, in, the, early, 1960s, in, the, late, 1960s, some, members, of, the, scientific, community, began, to, express, pointed, concerns, these, anti, nuclear, concerns, related, to, nuclear, accidents, nuclear, proliferation, nuclear, terrorism, and, radioactive, waste, disposal, in, the, early, 1970s, there, were, large, protests, about, a, proposed, nuclear, power, plant, in, wyhl, germany, the, project, was, cancelled, in, 1975, the, anti, nuclear, success, at, wyhl, inspired, opposition, to, nuclear, power, in, other, parts, of, europe, and, north, america, by, the, mid, 1970s, anti, nuclear, activism, gained, a, wider, appeal, and, influence, and, nuclear, power, began, to, become, an, issue, of, major, public, protest, in, some, countries, the, nuclear, power, conflict, reached, an, intensity, unprecedented, in, the, history, of, technology, controversies, the, increased, public, hostility, to, nuclear, power, led, to, a, longer, license, procurement, process, more, regulations, and, increased, requirements, for, safety, equipment, which, made, new, construction, much, more, expensive, in, the, united, states, over, 120, light, water, reactor, proposals, were, ultimately, cancelled, and, the, construction, of, new, reactors, ground, to, a, halt, the, 1979, accident, at, three, mile, island, with, no, fatalities, played, a, major, part, in, the, reduction, in, the, number, of, new, plant, constructions, in, many, countries, during, the, 1980s, one, new, nuclear, reactor, started, up, every, 17, days, on, average, by, the, end, of, the, decade, global, installed, nuclear, capacity, reached, 300, gw, since, the, late, 1980s, new, capacity, additions, slowed, significantly, with, the, installed, nuclear, capacity, reaching, 366, gw, in, 2005, the, 1986, chernobyl, disaster, in, the, ussr, involving, an, rbmk, reactor, altered, the, development, of, nuclear, power, and, led, to, a, greater, focus, on, meeting, international, safety, and, regulatory, standards, it, is, considered, the, worst, nuclear, disaster, in, history, both, in, total, casualties, with, 56, direct, deaths, and, financially, with, the, cleanup, and, the, cost, estimated, at, 18, billion, rbls, us, 68, billion, in, 2019, adjusted, for, inflation, the, international, organization, to, promote, safety, awareness, and, the, professional, development, of, operators, in, nuclear, facilities, the, world, association, of, nuclear, operators, wano, was, created, as, a, direct, outcome, of, the, 1986, chernobyl, accident, the, chernobyl, disaster, played, a, major, part, in, the, reduction, in, the, number, of, new, plant, constructions, in, the, following, years, influenced, by, these, events, italy, voted, against, nuclear, power, in, a, 1987, referendum, becoming, the, first, country, to, completely, phase, out, nuclear, power, in, 1990, in, the, early, 2000s, nuclear, energy, was, expecting, a, nuclear, renaissance, an, increase, in, the, construction, of, new, reactors, due, to, concerns, about, carbon, dioxide, emissions, during, this, period, newer, generation, iii, reactors, such, as, the, epr, began, construction, prospects, of, a, nuclear, renaissance, were, delayed, by, another, nuclear, accident, the, 2011, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, accident, was, caused, by, the, t, hoku, earthquake, and, tsunami, one, of, the, largest, earthquakes, ever, recorded, the, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, power, plant, suffered, three, core, meltdowns, due, to, failure, of, the, emergency, cooling, system, for, lack, of, electricity, supply, this, resulted, in, the, most, serious, nuclear, accident, since, the, chernobyl, disaster, the, accident, prompted, a, re, examination, of, nuclear, safety, and, nuclear, energy, policy, in, many, countries, germany, approved, plans, to, close, all, its, reactors, by, 2022, and, many, other, countries, reviewed, their, nuclear, power, programs, following, the, disaster, japan, shut, down, all, of, its, nuclear, power, reactors, some, of, them, permanently, and, in, 2015, began, a, gradual, process, to, restart, the, remaining, 40, reactors, following, safety, checks, and, based, on, revised, criteria, for, operations, and, public, approval, in, 2022, the, japanese, government, under, the, leadership, of, prime, minister, fumio, kishida, declared, that, 10, more, nuclear, power, plants, were, to, be, reopened, since, the, 2011, disaster, kishida, is, also, pushing, for, research, and, construction, of, new, safer, nuclear, plants, to, safeguard, japanese, consumers, from, the, fluctuating, price, of, the, fossil, fuel, market, and, reduce, japan, s, greenhouse, gas, emissions, kishida, intends, to, have, japan, become, a, significant, exporter, of, nuclear, energy, and, technology, to, developing, countries, around, the, world, by, 2015, the, iaea, s, outlook, for, nuclear, energy, had, become, more, promising, recognizing, the, importance, of, low, carbon, generation, for, mitigating, climate, change, as, of, 2015, the, global, trend, was, for, new, nuclear, power, stations, coming, online, to, be, balanced, by, the, number, of, old, plants, being, retired, in, 2016, the, u, s, energy, information, administration, projected, for, its, base, case, that, world, nuclear, power, generation, would, increase, from, 2, 344, terawatt, hours, twh, in, 2012, to, 4, 500, twh, in, 2040, most, of, the, predicted, increase, was, expected, to, be, in, asia, as, of, 2018, there, were, over, 150, nuclear, reactors, planned, including, 50, under, construction, in, january, 2019, china, had, 45, reactors, in, operation, 13, under, construction, and, planned, to, build, 43, more, which, would, make, it, the, world, s, largest, generator, of, nuclear, electricity, as, of, 2021, 17, reactors, were, reported, to, be, under, construction, china, built, significantly, fewer, reactors, than, originally, planned, its, share, of, electricity, from, nuclear, power, was, 5, in, 2019, and, observers, have, cautioned, that, along, with, the, risks, the, changing, economics, of, energy, generation, may, cause, new, nuclear, energy, plants, to, no, longer, make, sense, in, a, world, that, is, leaning, toward, cheaper, more, reliable, renewable, energy, in, october, 2021, the, japanese, cabinet, approved, the, new, plan, for, electricity, generation, to, 2030, prepared, by, the, agency, for, natural, resources, and, energy, anre, and, an, advisory, committee, following, public, consultation, the, nuclear, target, for, 2030, requires, the, restart, of, another, ten, reactors, prime, minister, fumio, kishida, in, july, 2022, announced, that, the, country, should, consider, building, advanced, reactors, and, extending, operating, licences, beyond, 60, years, as, of, 2022, with, world, oil, and, gas, prices, on, the, rise, while, germany, is, restarting, its, coal, plants, to, deal, with, loss, of, russian, gas, that, it, needs, to, supplement, its, energiewende, many, other, countries, have, announced, ambitious, plans, to, reinvigorate, ageing, nuclear, generating, capacity, with, new, investments, french, president, emmanuel, macron, announced, his, intention, to, build, six, new, reactors, in, coming, decades, placing, nuclear, at, the, heart, of, france, s, drive, for, carbon, neutrality, by, 2050, meanwhile, in, the, united, states, the, department, of, energy, in, collaboration, with, commercial, entities, terrapower, and, x, energy, is, planning, on, building, two, different, advanced, nuclear, reactors, by, 2027, with, further, plans, for, nuclear, implementation, in, its, long, term, green, energy, and, energy, security, goals, nuclear, power, plants, are, thermal, power, stations, that, generate, electricity, by, harnessing, the, thermal, energy, released, from, nuclear, fission, a, fission, nuclear, power, plant, is, generally, composed, of, a, nuclear, reactor, in, which, the, nuclear, reactions, generating, heat, take, place, a, cooling, system, which, removes, the, heat, from, inside, the, reactor, a, steam, turbine, which, transforms, the, heat, into, mechanical, energy, an, electric, generator, which, transforms, the, mechanical, energy, into, electrical, energy, when, a, neutron, hits, the, nucleus, of, a, uranium, 235, or, plutonium, atom, it, can, split, the, nucleus, into, two, smaller, nuclei, which, is, a, nuclear, fission, reaction, the, reaction, releases, energy, and, neutrons, the, released, neutrons, can, hit, other, uranium, or, plutonium, nuclei, causing, new, fission, reactions, which, release, more, energy, and, more, neutrons, this, is, called, a, chain, reaction, in, most, commercial, reactors, the, reaction, rate, is, contained, by, control, rods, that, absorb, excess, neutrons, the, controllability, of, nuclear, reactors, depends, on, the, fact, that, a, small, fraction, of, neutrons, resulting, from, fission, are, delayed, the, time, delay, between, the, fission, and, the, release, of, the, neutrons, slows, changes, in, reaction, rates, and, gives, time, for, moving, the, control, rods, to, adjust, the, reaction, rate, the, life, cycle, of, nuclear, fuel, starts, with, uranium, mining, the, uranium, ore, is, then, converted, into, a, compact, ore, concentrate, form, known, as, yellowcake, u, 3, o, 8, to, facilitate, transport, fission, reactors, generally, need, uranium, 235, a, fissile, isotope, of, uranium, the, concentration, of, uranium, 235, in, natural, uranium, is, low, about, 0, 7, some, reactors, can, use, this, natural, uranium, as, fuel, depending, on, their, neutron, economy, these, reactors, generally, have, graphite, or, heavy, water, moderators, for, light, water, reactors, the, most, common, type, of, reactor, this, concentration, is, too, low, and, it, must, be, increased, by, a, process, called, uranium, enrichment, in, civilian, light, water, reactors, uranium, is, typically, enriched, to, 3, 5, 5, uranium, 235, the, uranium, is, then, generally, converted, into, uranium, oxide, uo, 2, a, ceramic, that, is, then, compressively, sintered, into, fuel, pellets, a, stack, of, which, forms, fuel, rods, of, the, proper, composition, and, geometry, for, the, particular, reactor, after, some, time, in, the, reactor, the, fuel, will, have, reduced, fissile, material, and, increased, fission, products, until, its, use, becomes, impractical, at, this, point, the, spent, fuel, will, be, moved, to, a, spent, fuel, pool, which, provides, cooling, for, the, thermal, heat, and, shielding, for, ionizing, radiation, after, several, months, or, years, the, spent, fuel, is, radioactively, and, thermally, cool, enough, to, be, moved, to, dry, storage, casks, or, reprocessed, uranium, is, a, fairly, common, element, in, the, earth, s, crust, it, is, approximately, as, common, as, tin, or, germanium, and, is, about, 40, times, more, common, than, silver, uranium, is, present, in, trace, concentrations, in, most, rocks, dirt, and, ocean, water, but, is, generally, economically, extracted, only, where, it, is, present, in, relatively, high, concentrations, uranium, mining, can, be, underground, open, pit, or, in, situ, leach, mining, an, increasing, number, of, the, highest, output, mines, are, remote, underground, operations, such, as, mcarthur, river, uranium, mine, in, canada, which, by, itself, accounts, for, 13, of, global, production, as, of, 2011, the, world, s, known, resources, of, uranium, economically, recoverable, at, the, arbitrary, price, ceiling, of, us, 130, kg, were, enough, to, last, for, between, 70, and, 100, years, in, 2007, the, oecd, estimated, 670, years, of, economically, recoverable, uranium, in, total, conventional, resources, and, phosphate, ores, assuming, the, then, current, use, rate, light, water, reactors, make, relatively, inefficient, use, of, nuclear, fuel, mostly, using, only, the, very, rare, uranium, 235, isotope, nuclear, reprocessing, can, make, this, waste, reusable, and, newer, reactors, also, achieve, a, more, efficient, use, of, the, available, resources, than, older, ones, with, a, pure, fast, reactor, fuel, cycle, with, a, burn, up, of, all, the, uranium, and, actinides, which, presently, make, up, the, most, hazardous, substances, in, nuclear, waste, there, is, an, estimated, 160, 000, years, worth, of, uranium, in, total, conventional, resources, and, phosphate, ore, at, the, price, of, 60, 100, us, kg, however, reprocessing, is, expensive, possibly, dangerous, and, can, be, used, to, manufacture, nuclear, weapons, one, analysis, found, that, uranium, prices, could, increase, by, two, orders, of, magnitude, between, 2035, and, 2100, and, that, there, could, be, a, shortage, near, the, end, of, the, century, a, 2017, study, by, researchers, from, mit, and, whoi, found, that, at, the, current, consumption, rate, global, conventional, reserves, of, terrestrial, uranium, approximately, 7, 6, million, tonnes, could, be, depleted, in, a, little, over, a, century, limited, uranium, 235, supply, may, inhibit, substantial, expansion, with, the, current, nuclear, technology, while, various, ways, to, reduce, dependence, on, such, resources, are, being, explored, new, nuclear, technologies, are, considered, to, not, be, available, in, time, for, climate, change, mitigation, purposes, or, competition, with, alternatives, of, renewables, in, addition, to, being, more, expensive, and, require, costly, research, and, development, a, study, found, it, to, be, uncertain, whether, identified, resources, will, be, developed, quickly, enough, to, provide, uninterrupted, fuel, supply, to, expanded, nuclear, facilities, and, various, forms, of, mining, may, be, challenged, by, ecological, barriers, costs, and, land, requirements, researchers, also, report, considerable, import, dependence, of, nuclear, energy, unconventional, uranium, resources, also, exist, uranium, is, naturally, present, in, seawater, at, a, concentration, of, about, 3, micrograms, per, liter, with, 4, 4, billion, tons, of, uranium, considered, present, in, seawater, at, any, time, in, 2014, it, was, suggested, that, it, would, be, economically, competitive, to, produce, nuclear, fuel, from, seawater, if, the, process, was, implemented, at, large, scale, like, fossil, fuels, over, geological, timescales, uranium, extracted, on, an, industrial, scale, from, seawater, would, be, replenished, by, both, river, erosion, of, rocks, and, the, natural, process, of, uranium, dissolved, from, the, surface, area, of, the, ocean, floor, both, of, which, maintain, the, solubility, equilibria, of, seawater, concentration, at, a, stable, level, some, commentators, have, argued, that, this, strengthens, the, case, for, nuclear, power, to, be, considered, a, renewable, energy, the, normal, operation, of, nuclear, power, plants, and, facilities, produce, radioactive, waste, or, nuclear, waste, this, type, of, waste, is, also, produced, during, plant, decommissioning, there, are, two, broad, categories, of, nuclear, waste, low, level, waste, and, high, level, waste, the, first, has, low, radioactivity, and, includes, contaminated, items, such, as, clothing, which, poses, limited, threat, high, level, waste, is, mainly, the, spent, fuel, from, nuclear, reactors, which, is, very, radioactive, and, must, be, cooled, and, then, safely, disposed, of, or, reprocessed, the, most, important, waste, stream, from, nuclear, power, reactors, is, spent, nuclear, fuel, which, is, considered, high, level, waste, for, light, water, reactors, lwrs, spent, fuel, is, typically, composed, of, 95, uranium, 4, fission, products, and, about, 1, transuranic, actinides, mostly, plutonium, neptunium, and, americium, the, fission, products, are, responsible, for, the, bulk, of, the, short, term, radioactivity, whereas, the, plutonium, and, other, transuranics, are, responsible, for, the, bulk, of, the, long, term, radioactivity, high, level, waste, hlw, must, be, stored, isolated, from, the, biosphere, with, sufficient, shielding, so, as, to, limit, radiation, exposure, after, being, removed, from, the, reactors, used, fuel, bundles, are, stored, for, six, to, ten, years, in, spent, fuel, pools, which, provide, cooling, and, shielding, against, radiation, after, that, the, fuel, is, cool, enough, that, it, can, be, safely, transferred, to, dry, cask, storage, the, radioactivity, decreases, exponentially, with, time, such, that, it, will, have, decreased, by, 99, 5, after, 100, years, the, more, intensely, radioactive, short, lived, fission, products, slfps, decay, into, stable, elements, in, approximately, 300, years, and, after, about, 100, 000, years, the, spent, fuel, becomes, less, radioactive, than, natural, uranium, ore, commonly, suggested, methods, to, isolate, llfp, waste, from, the, biosphere, include, separation, and, transmutation, synroc, treatments, or, deep, geological, storage, thermal, neutron, reactors, which, presently, constitute, the, majority, of, the, world, fleet, cannot, burn, up, the, reactor, grade, plutonium, that, is, generated, during, the, reactor, operation, this, limits, the, life, of, nuclear, fuel, to, a, few, years, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, spent, fuel, is, classified, in, its, entirety, as, a, nuclear, waste, in, other, countries, such, as, france, it, is, largely, reprocessed, to, produce, a, partially, recycled, fuel, known, as, mixed, oxide, fuel, or, mox, for, spent, fuel, that, does, not, undergo, reprocessing, the, most, concerning, isotopes, are, the, medium, lived, transuranic, elements, which, are, led, by, reactor, grade, plutonium, half, life, 24, 000, years, some, proposed, reactor, designs, such, as, the, integral, fast, reactor, and, molten, salt, reactors, can, use, as, fuel, the, plutonium, and, other, actinides, in, spent, fuel, from, light, water, reactors, thanks, to, their, fast, fission, spectrum, this, offers, a, potentially, more, attractive, alternative, to, deep, geological, disposal, the, thorium, fuel, cycle, results, in, similar, fission, products, though, creates, a, much, smaller, proportion, of, transuranic, elements, from, neutron, capture, events, within, a, reactor, spent, thorium, fuel, although, more, difficult, to, handle, than, spent, uranium, fuel, may, present, somewhat, lower, proliferation, risks, the, nuclear, industry, also, produces, a, large, volume, of, low, level, waste, with, low, radioactivity, in, the, form, of, contaminated, items, like, clothing, hand, tools, water, purifier, resins, and, upon, decommissioning, the, materials, of, which, the, reactor, itself, is, built, low, level, waste, can, be, stored, on, site, until, radiation, levels, are, low, enough, to, be, disposed, of, as, ordinary, waste, or, it, can, be, sent, to, a, low, level, waste, disposal, site, in, countries, with, nuclear, power, radioactive, wastes, account, for, less, than, 1, of, total, industrial, toxic, wastes, much, of, which, remains, hazardous, for, long, periods, overall, nuclear, power, produces, far, less, waste, material, by, volume, than, fossil, fuel, based, power, plants, coal, burning, plants, in, particular, produce, large, amounts, of, toxic, and, mildly, radioactive, ash, resulting, from, the, concentration, of, naturally, occurring, radioactive, materials, in, coal, a, 2008, report, from, oak, ridge, national, laboratory, concluded, that, coal, power, actually, results, in, more, radioactivity, being, released, into, the, environment, than, nuclear, power, operation, and, that, the, population, effective, dose, equivalent, from, radiation, from, coal, plants, is, 100, times, that, from, the, operation, of, nuclear, plants, although, coal, ash, is, much, less, radioactive, than, spent, nuclear, fuel, by, weight, coal, ash, is, produced, in, much, higher, quantities, per, unit, of, energy, generated, it, is, also, released, directly, into, the, environment, as, fly, ash, whereas, nuclear, plants, use, shielding, to, protect, the, environment, from, radioactive, materials, nuclear, waste, volume, is, small, compared, to, the, energy, produced, for, example, at, yankee, rowe, nuclear, power, station, which, generated, 44, billion, kilowatt, hours, of, electricity, when, in, service, its, complete, spent, fuel, inventory, is, contained, within, sixteen, casks, it, is, estimated, that, to, produce, a, lifetime, supply, of, energy, for, a, person, at, a, western, standard, of, living, approximately, 3, gwh, would, require, on, the, order, of, the, volume, of, a, soda, can, of, low, enriched, uranium, resulting, in, a, similar, volume, of, spent, fuel, generated, following, interim, storage, in, a, spent, fuel, pool, the, bundles, of, used, fuel, rod, assemblies, of, a, typical, nuclear, power, station, are, often, stored, on, site, in, dry, cask, storage, vessels, presently, waste, is, mainly, stored, at, individual, reactor, sites, and, there, are, over, 430, locations, around, the, world, where, radioactive, material, continues, to, accumulate, disposal, of, nuclear, waste, is, often, considered, the, most, politically, divisive, aspect, in, the, lifecycle, of, a, nuclear, power, facility, the, lack, of, movement, of, nuclear, waste, in, the, 2, billion, year, old, natural, nuclear, fission, reactors, in, oklo, gabon, is, cited, as, a, source, of, essential, information, today, experts, suggest, that, centralized, underground, repositories, which, are, well, managed, guarded, and, monitored, would, be, a, vast, improvement, there, is, an, international, consensus, on, the, advisability, of, storing, nuclear, waste, in, deep, geological, repositories, with, the, advent, of, new, technologies, other, methods, including, horizontal, drillhole, disposal, into, geologically, inactive, areas, have, been, proposed, there, are, no, commercial, scale, purpose, built, underground, high, level, waste, repositories, in, operation, however, in, finland, the, onkalo, spent, nuclear, fuel, repository, of, the, olkiluoto, nuclear, power, plant, was, under, construction, as, of, 2015, most, thermal, neutron, reactors, run, on, a, once, through, nuclear, fuel, cycle, mainly, due, to, the, low, price, of, fresh, uranium, however, many, reactors, are, also, fueled, with, recycled, fissionable, materials, that, remain, in, spent, nuclear, fuel, the, most, common, fissionable, material, that, is, recycled, is, the, reactor, grade, plutonium, rgpu, that, is, extracted, from, spent, fuel, it, is, mixed, with, uranium, oxide, and, fabricated, into, mixed, oxide, or, mox, fuel, because, thermal, lwrs, remain, the, most, common, reactor, worldwide, this, type, of, recycling, is, the, most, common, it, is, considered, to, increase, the, sustainability, of, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, reduce, the, attractiveness, of, spent, fuel, to, theft, and, lower, the, volume, of, high, level, nuclear, waste, spent, mox, fuel, cannot, generally, be, recycled, for, use, in, thermal, neutron, reactors, this, issue, does, not, affect, fast, neutron, reactors, which, are, therefore, preferred, in, order, to, achieve, the, full, energy, potential, of, the, original, uranium, the, main, constituent, of, spent, fuel, from, lwrs, is, slightly, enriched, uranium, this, can, be, recycled, into, reprocessed, uranium, repu, which, can, be, used, in, a, fast, reactor, used, directly, as, fuel, in, candu, reactors, or, re, enriched, for, another, cycle, through, an, lwr, re, enriching, of, reprocessed, uranium, is, common, in, france, and, russia, reprocessed, uranium, is, also, safer, in, terms, of, nuclear, proliferation, potential, reprocessing, has, the, potential, to, recover, up, to, 95, of, the, uranium, and, plutonium, fuel, in, spent, nuclear, fuel, as, well, as, reduce, long, term, radioactivity, within, the, remaining, waste, however, reprocessing, has, been, politically, controversial, because, of, the, potential, for, nuclear, proliferation, and, varied, perceptions, of, increasing, the, vulnerability, to, nuclear, terrorism, reprocessing, also, leads, to, higher, fuel, cost, compared, to, the, once, through, fuel, cycle, while, reprocessing, reduces, the, volume, of, high, level, waste, it, does, not, reduce, the, fission, products, that, are, the, primary, causes, of, residual, heat, generation, and, radioactivity, for, the, first, few, centuries, outside, the, reactor, thus, reprocessed, waste, still, requires, an, almost, identical, treatment, for, the, initial, first, few, hundred, years, reprocessing, of, civilian, fuel, from, power, reactors, is, currently, done, in, france, the, united, kingdom, russia, japan, and, india, in, the, united, states, spent, nuclear, fuel, is, currently, not, reprocessed, the, la, hague, reprocessing, facility, in, france, has, operated, commercially, since, 1976, and, is, responsible, for, half, the, world, s, reprocessing, as, of, 2010, it, produces, mox, fuel, from, spent, fuel, derived, from, several, countries, more, than, 32, 000, tonnes, of, spent, fuel, had, been, reprocessed, as, of, 2015, with, the, majority, from, france, 17, from, germany, and, 9, from, japan, breeding, is, the, process, of, converting, non, fissile, material, into, fissile, material, that, can, be, used, as, nuclear, fuel, the, non, fissile, material, that, can, be, used, for, this, process, is, called, fertile, material, and, constitute, the, vast, majority, of, current, nuclear, waste, this, breeding, process, occurs, naturally, in, breeder, reactors, as, opposed, to, light, water, thermal, neutron, reactors, which, use, uranium, 235, 0, 7, of, all, natural, uranium, fast, neutron, breeder, reactors, use, uranium, 238, 99, 3, of, all, natural, uranium, or, thorium, a, number, of, fuel, cycles, and, breeder, reactor, combinations, are, considered, to, be, sustainable, or, renewable, sources, of, energy, in, 2006, it, was, estimated, that, with, seawater, extraction, there, was, likely, five, billion, years, worth, of, uranium, resources, for, use, in, breeder, reactors, breeder, technology, has, been, used, in, several, reactors, but, as, of, 2006, the, high, cost, of, reprocessing, fuel, safely, requires, uranium, prices, of, more, than, us, 200, kg, before, becoming, justified, economically, breeder, reactors, are, however, being, developed, for, their, potential, to, burn, all, of, the, actinides, the, most, active, and, dangerous, components, in, the, present, inventory, of, nuclear, waste, while, also, producing, power, and, creating, additional, quantities, of, fuel, for, more, reactors, via, the, breeding, process, as, of, 2017, there, are, two, breeders, producing, commercial, power, bn, 600, reactor, and, the, bn, 800, reactor, both, in, russia, the, ph, nix, breeder, reactor, in, france, was, powered, down, in, 2009, after, 36, years, of, operation, both, china, and, india, are, building, breeder, reactors, the, indian, 500, mwe, prototype, fast, breeder, reactor, is, in, the, commissioning, phase, with, plans, to, build, more, another, alternative, to, fast, neutron, breeders, are, thermal, neutron, breeder, reactors, that, use, uranium, 233, bred, from, thorium, as, fission, fuel, in, the, thorium, fuel, cycle, thorium, is, about, 3, 5, times, more, common, than, uranium, in, the, earth, s, crust, and, has, different, geographic, characteristics, india, s, three, stage, nuclear, power, programme, features, the, use, of, a, thorium, fuel, cycle, in, the, third, stage, as, it, has, abundant, thorium, reserves, but, little, uranium, nuclear, decommissioning, is, the, process, of, dismantling, a, nuclear, facility, to, the, point, that, it, no, longer, requires, measures, for, radiation, protection, returning, the, facility, and, its, parts, to, a, safe, enough, level, to, be, entrusted, for, other, uses, due, to, the, presence, of, radioactive, materials, nuclear, decommissioning, presents, technical, and, economic, challenges, the, costs, of, decommissioning, are, generally, spread, over, the, lifetime, of, a, facility, and, saved, in, a, decommissioning, fund, 2021, world, electricity, generation, by, source, total, generation, was, 28, petawatt, hours, civilian, nuclear, power, supplied, 2, 586, terawatt, hours, twh, of, electricity, in, 2019, equivalent, to, about, 10, of, global, electricity, generation, and, was, the, second, largest, low, carbon, power, source, after, hydroelectricity, since, electricity, accounts, for, about, 25, of, world, energy, consumption, nuclear, power, s, contribution, to, global, energy, was, about, 2, 5, in, 2011, this, is, a, little, more, than, the, combined, global, electricity, production, from, wind, solar, biomass, and, geothermal, power, which, together, provided, 2, of, global, final, energy, consumption, in, 2014, nuclear, power, s, share, of, global, electricity, production, has, fallen, from, 16, 5, in, 1997, in, large, part, because, the, economics, of, nuclear, power, have, become, more, difficult, as, of, march, 2022, there, are, 439, civilian, fission, reactors, in, the, world, with, a, combined, electrical, capacity, of, 392, gigawatt, gw, there, are, also, 56, nuclear, power, reactors, under, construction, and, 96, reactors, planned, with, a, combined, capacity, of, 62, gw, and, 96, gw, respectively, the, united,

provides, 26, of, the, electricity, as, of, 2018, nuclear, power, is, the, single, largest, low, carbon, electricity, source, in, the, united, states, and, accounts, for, two, thirds, of, the, european, union, s, low, carbon, electricity, nuclear, energy, policy, differs, among, european, union, countries, and, some, such, as, austria, estonia, ireland, and, italy, have, no, active, nuclear, power, stations, in, addition, there, were, approximately, 140, naval, vessels, using, nuclear, propulsion, in, operation, powered, by, about, 180, reactors, these, include, military, and, some, civilian, ships, such, as, nuclear, powered, icebreakers, international, research, is, continuing, into, additional, uses, of, process, heat, such, as, hydrogen, production, in, support, of, a, hydrogen, economy, for, desalinating, sea, water, and, for, use, in, district, heating, systems, the, economics, of, new, nuclear, power, plants, is, a, controversial, subject, and, multi, billion, dollar, investments, depend, on, the, choice, of, energy, sources, nuclear, power, plants, typically, have, high, capital, costs, for, building, the, plant, for, this, reason, comparison, with, other, power, generation, methods, is, strongly, dependent, on, assumptions, about, construction, timescales, and, capital, financing, for, nuclear, plants, fuel, costs, account, for, about, 30, percent, of, the, operating, costs, while, prices, are, subject, to, the, market, the, high, cost, of, construction, is, one, of, the, biggest, challenges, for, nuclear, power, plants, a, new, 1, 100, mw, plant,

in, expertise, the, only, two, nations, for, which, data, is, available, that, saw, cost, decreases, in, the, 2000s, were, india, and, south, korea, analysis, of, the, economics, of, nuclear, power, must, also, take, into, account, who, bears, the, risks, of, future, uncertainties, as, of, 2010, all, operating, nuclear, power, plants, have, been, developed, by, state, owned, or, regulated, electric, utility, monopolies, many, countries, have, since, liberalized, the, electricity, market, where, these, risks, and, the, risk, of, cheaper, competitors, emerging, before, capital, costs, are, recovered, are, borne, by, plant, suppliers, and, operators, rather, than, consumers, which, leads, to, a, significantly, different, evaluation, of, the, economics, of, new, nuclear, power, plants, the, levelized, cost, of, electricity, lcoe, from, a, new, nuclear, power, plant, is, estimated, to, be, 69, usd, mwh, according, to, an, analysis, by, the, international, energy, agency, and, the, oecd, nuclear, energy, agency, this, represents, the, median, cost, estimate, for, an, nth, of, a, kind, nuclear, power, plant, to, be, completed, in, 2025, at, a, discount, rate, of, 7, nuclear, power, was, found, to, be, the, least, cost, option, among, dispatchable, technologies, variable, renewables, can, generate, cheaper, electricity, the, median, cost, of, onshore, wind, power, was, estimated, to, be, 50, usd, mwh, and, utility, scale, solar, power, 56, usd, mwh, at, the, assumed, co, 2, emission, cost, of, 30, usd, ton, power, from, coal, 88, usd, mwh, and, gas, 71, usd, mwh,

modular, reactors, such, as, those, developed, by, nuscale, power, are, aimed, at, reducing, the, investment, costs, for, new, construction, by, making, the, reactors, smaller, and, modular, so, that, they, can, be, built, in, a, factory, certain, designs, had, considerable, early, positive, economics, such, as, the, candu, which, realized, a, much, higher, capacity, factor, and, reliability, when, compared, to, generation, ii, light, water, reactors, up, to, the, 1990s, nuclear, power, plants, though, capable, of, some, grid, load, following, are, typically, run, as, much, as, possible, to, keep, the, cost, of, the, generated, electrical, energy, as, low, as, possible, supplying, mostly, base, load, electricity, due, to, the, on, line, refueling, reactor, design, phwrs, of, which, the, candu, design, is, a, part, continue, to, hold, many, world, record, positions, for, longest, continual, electricity, generation, often, over, 800, days, the, specific, record, as, of, 2019, is, held, by, a, phwr, at, kaiga, atomic, power, station, generating, electricity, continuously, for, 962, days, costs, not, considered, in, lcoe, calculations, include, funds, for, research, and, development, and, disasters, the, fukushima, disaster, is, estimated, to, cost, taxpayers, 187, billion, in, some, cases, governments, were, found, to, force, consumers, to, pay, upfront, for, potential, cost, overruns, or, subsidize, uneconomic, nuclear, energy, or, be, required, to, do, so, nuclear, operators, are, liable, to, pay, for, the, waste, management, in, the, european, union, in, the, u, s, the, congress, reportedly, decided, 40, years, ago, that, the, nation, and, not, private, companies, would, be, responsible, for, storing, radioactive, waste, with, taxpayers, paying, for, the, costs, the, world, nuclear, waste, report, 2019, found, that, even, in, countries, in, which, the, polluter, pays, principle, is, a, legal, requirement, it, is, applied, incompletely, and, notes, the, case, of, the, german, asse, ii, deep, geological, disposal, facility, where, the, retrieval, of, large, amounts, of, waste, has, to, be, paid, for, by, taxpayers, similarly, other, forms, of, energy, including, fossil, fuels, and, renewables, have, a, portion, of, their, costs, covered, by, governments, the, most, common, use, of, nuclear, power, in, space, is, the, use, of, radioisotope, thermoelectric, generators, which, use, radioactive, decay, to, generate, power, these, power, generators, are, relatively, small, scale, few, kw, and, they, are, mostly, used, to, power, space, missions, and, experiments, for, long, periods, where, solar, power, is, not, available, in, sufficient, quantity, such, as, in, the, voyager, 2, space, probe, a, few, space, vehicles, have, been, launched, using, nuclear, reactors, 34, reactors, belong, to, the, soviet, rorsat, series, and, one, was, the, american, snap, 10a, both, fission, and, fusion, appear, promising, for, space, propulsion, applications, generating, higher, mission, velocities, with, less, reaction, mass, nuclear, power, plants, have, three, unique, characteristics, that, affect, their, safety, as, compared, to, other, power, plants, firstly, intensely, radioactive, materials, are, present, in, a, nuclear, reactor, their, release, to, the, environment, could, be, hazardous, secondly, the, fission, products, which, make, up, most, of, the, intensely, radioactive, substances, in, the, reactor, continue, to, generate, a, significant, amount, of, decay, heat, even, after, the, fission, chain, reaction, has, stopped, if, the, heat, cannot, be, removed, from, the, reactor, the, fuel, rods, may, overheat, and, release, radioactive, materials, thirdly, a, criticality, accident, a, rapid, increase, of, the, reactor, power, is, possible, in, certain, reactor, designs, if, the, chain, reaction, cannot, be, controlled, these, three, characteristics, have, to, be, taken, into, account, when, designing, nuclear, reactors, all, modern, reactors, are, designed, so, that, an, uncontrolled, increase, of, the, reactor, power, is, prevented, by, natural, feedback, mechanisms, a, concept, known, as, negative, void, coefficient, of, reactivity, if, the, temperature, or, the, amount, of, steam, in, the, reactor, increases, the, fission, rate, inherently, decreases, the, chain, reaction, can, also, be, manually, stopped, by, inserting, control, rods, into, the, reactor, core, emergency, core, cooling, systems, eccs, can, remove, the, decay, heat, from, the, reactor, if, normal, cooling, systems, fail, if, the, eccs, fails, multiple, physical, barriers, limit, the, release, of, radioactive, materials, to, the, environment, even, in, the, case, of, an, accident, the, last, physical, barrier, is, the, large, containment, building, with, a, death, rate, of, 0, 03, per, twh, nuclear, power, is, the, second, safest, energy, source, per, unit, of, energy, generated, after, solar, power, in, terms, of, mortality, when, the, historical, track, record, is, considered, energy, produced, by, coal, petroleum, natural, gas, and, hydropower, has, caused, more, deaths, per, unit, of, energy, generated, due, to, air, pollution, and, energy, accidents, this, is, found, when, comparing, the, immediate, deaths, from, other, energy, sources, to, both, the, immediate, and, the, latent, or, predicted, indirect, cancer, deaths, from, nuclear, energy, accidents, when, the, direct, and, indirect, fatalities, including, fatalities, resulting, from, the, mining, and, air, pollution, from, nuclear, power, and, fossil, fuels, are, compared, the, use, of, nuclear, power, has, been, calculated, to, have, prevented, about, 1, 84, million, deaths, from, air, pollution, between, 1971, and, 2009, by, reducing, the, proportion, of, energy, that, would, otherwise, have, been, generated, by, fossil, fuels, following, the, 2011, fukushima, nuclear, disaster, it, has, been, estimated, that, if, japan, had, never, adopted, nuclear, power, accidents, and, pollution, from, coal, or, gas, plants, would, have, caused, more, lost, years, of, life, serious, impacts, of, nuclear, accidents, are, often, not, directly, attributable, to, radiation, exposure, but, rather, social, and, psychological, effects, evacuation, and, long, term, displacement, of, affected, populations, created, problems, for, many, people, especially, the, elderly, and, hospital, patients, forced, evacuation, from, a, nuclear, accident, may, lead, to, social, isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic, medical, problems, reckless, behavior, and, suicide, a, comprehensive, 2005, study, on, the, aftermath, of, the, chernobyl, disaster, concluded, that, the, mental, health, impact, is, the, largest, public, health, problem, caused, by, the, accident, frank, n, von, hippel, an, american, scientist, commented, that, a, disproportionate, fear, of, ionizing, radiation, radiophobia, could, have, long, term, psychological, effects, on, the, population, of, contaminated, areas, following, the, fukushima, disaster, some, serious, nuclear, and, radiation, accidents, have, occurred, the, severity, of, nuclear, accidents, is, generally, classified, using, the, international, nuclear, event, scale, ines, introduced, by, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, iaea, the, scale, ranks, anomalous, events, or, accidents, on, a, scale, from, 0, a, deviation, from, normal, operation, that, poses, no, safety, risk, to, 7, a, major, accident, with, widespread, effects, there, have, been, three, accidents, of, level, 5, or, higher, in, the, civilian, nuclear, power, industry, two, of, which, the, chernobyl, accident, and, the, fukushima, accident, are, ranked, at, level, 7, the, first, major, nuclear, accidents, were, the, kyshtym, disaster, in, the, soviet, union, and, the, windscale, fire, in, the, united, kingdom, both, in, 1957, the, first, major, accident, at, a, nuclear, reactor, in, the, usa, occurred, in, 1961, at, the, sl, 1, a, u, s, army, experimental, nuclear, power, reactor, at, the, idaho, national, laboratory, an, uncontrolled, chain, reaction, resulted, in, a, steam, explosion, which, killed, the, three, crew, members, and, caused, a, meltdown, another, serious, accident, happened, in, 1968, when, one, of, the, two, liquid, metal, cooled, reactors, on, board, the, soviet, submarine, k, 27, underwent, a, fuel, element, failure, with, the, emission, of, gaseous, fission, products, into, the, surrounding, air, resulting, in, 9, crew, fatalities, and, 83, injuries, the, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, accident, was, caused, by, the, 2011, tohoku, earthquake, and, tsunami, the, accident, has, not, caused, any, radiation, related, deaths, but, resulted, in, radioactive, contamination, of, surrounding, areas, the, difficult, cleanup, operation, is, expected, to, cost, tens, of, billions, of, dollars, over, 40, or, more, years, the, three, mile, island, accident, in, 1979, was, a, smaller, scale, accident, rated, at, ines, level, 5, there, were, no, direct, or, indirect, deaths, caused, by, the, accident, the, impact, of, nuclear, accidents, is, controversial, according, to, benjamin, k, sovacool, fission, energy, accidents, ranked, first, among, energy, sources, in, terms, of, their, total, economic, cost, accounting, for, 41, of, all, property, damage, attributed, to, energy, accidents, another, analysis, found, that, coal, oil, liquid, petroleum, gas, and, hydroelectric, accidents, primarily, due, to, the, banqiao, dam, disaster, have, resulted, in, greater, economic, impacts, than, nuclear, power, accidents, the, study, compares, latent, cancer, deaths, attributable, to, nuclear, power, with, immediate, deaths, from, other, energy, sources, per, unit, of, energy, generated, and, does, not, include, fossil, fuel, related, cancer, and, other, indirect, deaths, created, by, the, use, of, fossil, fuel, consumption, in, its, severe, accident, an, accident, with, more, than, five, fatalities, classification, the, chernobyl, accident, in, 1986, caused, approximately, 50, deaths, from, direct, and, indirect, effects, and, some, temporary, serious, injuries, from, acute, radiation, syndrome, the, future, predicted, mortality, from, increases, in, cancer, rates, is, estimated, at, 4000, in, the, decades, to, come, however, the, costs, have, been, large, and, are, increasing, nuclear, power, works, under, an, insurance, framework, that, limits, or, structures, accident, liabilities, in, accordance, with, national, and, international, conventions, it, is, often, argued, that, this, potential, shortfall, in, liability, represents, an, external, cost, not, included, in, the, cost, of, nuclear, electricity, this, cost, is, small, amounting, to, about, 0, 1, of, the, levelized, cost, of, electricity, according, to, a, study, by, the, congressional, budget, office, in, the, united, states, these, beyond, regular, insurance, costs, for, worst, case, scenarios, are, not, unique, to, nuclear, power, hydroelectric, power, plants, are, similarly, not, fully, insured, against, a, catastrophic, event, such, as, dam, failures, for, example, the, failure, of, the, banqiao, dam, caused, the, death, of, an, estimated, 30, 000, to, 200, 000, people, and, 11, million, people, lost, their, homes, as, private, insurers, base, dam, insurance, premiums, on, limited, scenarios, major, disaster, insurance, in, this, sector, is, likewise, provided, by, the, state, terrorists, could, target, nuclear, power, plants, in, an, attempt, to, release, radioactive, contamination, into, the, community, the, united, states, 9, 11, commission, has, said, that, nuclear, power, plants, were, potential, targets, originally, considered, for, the, september, 11, 2001, attacks, an, attack, on, a, reactor, s, spent, fuel, pool, could, also, be, serious, as, these, pools, are, less, protected, than, the, reactor, core, the, release, of, radioactivity, could, lead, to, thousands, of, near, term, deaths, and, greater, numbers, of, long, term, fatalities, in, the, united, states, the, nuclear, regulatory, commission, carries, out, force, on, force, fof, exercises, at, all, nuclear, power, plant, sites, at, least, once, every, three, years, in, the, united, states, plants, are, surrounded, by, a, double, row, of, tall, fences, which, are, electronically, monitored, the, plant, grounds, are, patrolled, by, a, sizeable, force, of, armed, guards, insider, sabotage, is, also, a, threat, because, insiders, can, observe, and, work, around, security, measures, successful, insider, crimes, depended, on, the, perpetrators, observation, and, knowledge, of, security, vulnerabilities, a, fire, caused, 5, 10, million, dollars, worth, of, damage, to, new, york, s, indian, point, energy, center, in, 1971, the, arsonist, was, a, plant, maintenance, worker, nuclear, proliferation, is, the, spread, of, nuclear, weapons, fissionable, material, and, weapons, related, nuclear, technology, to, states, that, do, not, already, possess, nuclear, weapons, many, technologies, and, materials, associated, with, the, creation, of, a, nuclear, power, program, have, a, dual, use, capability, in, that, they, can, also, be, used, to, make, nuclear, weapons, for, this, reason, nuclear, power, presents, proliferation, risks, nuclear, power, program, can, become, a, route, leading, to, a, nuclear, weapon, an, example, of, this, is, the, concern, over, iran, s, nuclear, program, the, re, purposing, of, civilian, nuclear, industries, for, military, purposes, would, be, a, breach, of, the, non, proliferation, treaty, to, which, 190, countries, adhere, as, of, april, 2012, there, are, thirty, one, countries, that, have, civil, nuclear, power, plants, of, which, nine, have, nuclear, weapons, the, vast, majority, of, these, nuclear, weapons, states, have, produced, weapons, before, commercial, nuclear, power, stations, a, fundamental, goal, for, global, security, is, to, minimize, the, nuclear, proliferation, risks, associated, with, the, expansion, of, nuclear, power, the, global, nuclear, energy, partnership, was, an, international, effort, to, create, a, distribution, network, in, which, developing, countries, in, need, of, energy, would, receive, nuclear, fuel, at, a, discounted, rate, in, exchange, for, that, nation, agreeing, to, forgo, their, own, indigenous, development, of, a, uranium, enrichment, program, the, france, based, eurodif, european, gaseous, diffusion, uranium, enrichment, consortium, is, a, program, that, successfully, implemented, this, concept, with, spain, and, other, countries, without, enrichment, facilities, buying, a, share, of, the, fuel, produced, at, the, french, controlled, enrichment, facility, but, without, a, transfer, of, technology, iran, was, an, early, participant, from, 1974, and, remains, a, shareholder, of, eurodif, via, sofidif, a, 2009, united, nations, report, said, that, the, revival, of, interest, in, nuclear, power, could, result, in, the, worldwide, dissemination, of, uranium, enrichment, and, spent, fuel, reprocessing, technologies, which, present, obvious, risks, of, proliferation, as, these, technologies, can, produce, fissile, materials, that, are, directly, usable, in, nuclear, weapons, on, the, other, hand, power, reactors, can, also, reduce, nuclear, weapon, arsenals, when, military, grade, nuclear, materials, are, reprocessed, to, be, used, as, fuel, in, nuclear, power, plants, the, megatons, to, megawatts, program, is, considered, the, single, most, successful, non, proliferation, program, to, date, up, to, 2005, the, program, had, processed, 8, billion, of, high, enriched, weapons, grade, uranium, into, low, enriched, uranium, suitable, as, nuclear, fuel, for, commercial, fission, reactors, by, diluting, it, with, natural, uranium, this, corresponds, to, the, elimination, of, 10, 000, nuclear, weapons, for, approximately, two, decades, this, material, generated, nearly, 10, percent, of, all, the, electricity, consumed, in, the, united, states, or, about, half, of, all, u, s, nuclear, electricity, with, a, total, of, around, 7, 000, twh, of, electricity, produced, in, total, it, is, estimated, to, have, cost, 17, billion, a, bargain, for, us, ratepayers, with, russia, profiting, 12, billion, from, the, deal, much, needed, profit, for, the, russian, nuclear, oversight, industry, which, after, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, economy, had, difficulties, paying, for, the, maintenance, and, security, of, the, russian, federations, highly, enriched, uranium, and, warheads, the, megatons, to, megawatts, program, was, hailed, as, a, major, success, by, anti, nuclear, weapon, advocates, as, it, has, largely, been, the, driving, force, behind, the, sharp, reduction, in, the, number, of, nuclear, weapons, worldwide, since, the, cold, war, ended, however, without, an, increase, in, nuclear, reactors, and, greater, demand, for, fissile, fuel, the, cost, of, dismantling, and, down, blending, has, dissuaded, russia, from, continuing, their, disarmament, as, of, 2013, russia, appears, to, not, be, interested, in, extending, the, program, being, a, low, carbon, energy, source, with, relatively, little, land, use, requirements, nuclear, energy, can, have, a, positive, environmental, impact, it, also, requires, a, constant, supply, of, significant, amounts, of, water, and, affects, the, environment, through, mining, and, milling, its, largest, potential, negative, impacts, on, the, environment, may, arise, from, its, transgenerational, risks, for, nuclear, weapons, proliferation, that, may, increase, risks, of, their, use, in, the, future, risks, for, problems, associated, with, the, management, of, the, radioactive, waste, such, as, groundwater, contamination, risks, for, accidents, and, for, risks, for, various, forms, of, attacks, on, waste, storage, sites, or, reprocessing, and, power, plants, however, these, remain, mostly, only, risks, as, historically, there, have, only, been, few, disasters, at, nuclear, power, plants, with, known, relatively, substantial, environmental, impacts, nuclear, power, is, one, of, the, leading, low, carbon, power, generation, methods, of, producing, electricity, and, in, terms, of, total, life, cycle, greenhouse, gas, emissions, per, unit, of, energy, generated, has, emission, values, comparable, to, or, lower, than, renewable, energy, a, 2014, analysis, of, the, carbon, footprint, literature, by, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, reported, that, the, embodied, total, life, cycle, emission, intensity, of, nuclear, power, has, a, median, value, of, 12, g, co, 2, eq, kwh, which, is, the, lowest, among, all, commercial, baseload, energy, sources, this, is, contrasted, with, coal, and, natural, gas, at, 820, and, 490, g, co, 2, eq, kwh, as, of, 2021, nuclear, reactors, worldwide, have, helped, avoid, the, emission, of, 72, billion, tonnes, of, carbon, dioxide, since, 1970, compared, to, coal, fired, electricity, generation, according, to, a, report, the, average, dose, from, natural, background, radiation, is, 2, 4, millisievert, per, year, msv, a, globally, it, varies, between, 1, msv, a, and, 13, msv, a, depending, mostly, on, the, geology, of, the, location, according, to, the, united, nations, unscear, regular, nuclear, power, plant, operations, including, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, increases, this, amount, by, 0, 0002, msv, a, of, public, exposure, as, a, global, average, the, average, dose, from, operating, nuclear, power, plants, to, the, local, populations, around, them, is, less, than, 0, 0001, msv, a, for, comparison, the, average, dose, to, those, living, within, 50, miles, 80, km, of, a, coal, power, plant, is, over, three, times, this, dose, at, 0, 0003, msv, a, chernobyl, resulted, in, the, most, affected, surrounding, populations, and, male, recovery, personnel, receiving, an, average, initial, 50, to, 100, msv, over, a, few, hours, to, weeks, while, the, remaining, global, legacy, of, the, worst, nuclear, power, plant, accident, in, average, exposure, is, 0, 002, msv, a, and, is, continuously, dropping, at, the, decaying, rate, from, the, initial, high, of, 0, 04, msv, per, person, averaged, over, the, entire, populace, of, the, northern, hemisphere, in, the, year, of, the, accident, in, 1986, the, nuclear, power, debate, concerns, the, controversy, which, has, surrounded, the, deployment, and, use, of, nuclear, fission, reactors, to, generate, electricity, from, nuclear, fuel, for, civilian, purposes, proponents, of, nuclear, energy, regard, it, as, a, sustainable, energy, source, that, reduces, carbon, emissions, and, increases, energy, security, by, decreasing, dependence, on, other, energy, sources, that, are, also, often, dependent, on, imports, for, example, proponents, note, that, annually, nuclear, generated, electricity, reduces, 470, million, metric, tons, of, carbon, dioxide, emissions, that, would, otherwise, come, from, fossil, fuels, additionally, the, amount, of, comparatively, low, waste, that, nuclear, energy, does, create, is, safely, disposed, of, by, the, large, scale, nuclear, energy, production, facilities, or, it, is, repurposed, recycled, for, other, energy, uses, m, king, hubbert, who, popularized, the, concept, of, peak, oil, saw, oil, as, a, resource, that, would, run, out, and, considered, nuclear, energy, its, replacement, proponents, also, claim, that, the, present, quantity, of, nuclear, waste, is, small, and, can, be, reduced, through, the, latest, technology, of, newer, reactors, and, that, the, operational, safety, record, of, fission, electricity, in, terms, of, deaths, is, so, far, unparalleled, kharecha, and, hansen, estimated, that, global, nuclear, power, has, prevented, an, average, of, 1, 84, million, air, pollution, related, deaths, and, 64, gigatonnes, of, co, 2, equivalent, gtco, 2, eq, greenhouse, gas, ghg, emissions, that, would, have, resulted, from, fossil, fuel, burning, and, if, continued, it, could, prevent, up, to, 7, million, deaths, and, 240, gtco, 2, eq, emissions, by, 2050, proponents, also, bring, to, attention, the, opportunity, cost, of, using, other, forms, of, electricity, for, example, the, environmental, protection, agency, estimates, that, coal, kills, 30, 000, people, a, year, as, a, result, of, its, environmental, impact, while, 60, people, died, in, the, chernobyl, disaster, a, real, world, example, of, impact, provided, by, proponents, is, the, 650, 000, ton, increase, in, carbon, emissions, in, the, two, months, following, the, closure, of, the, vermont, yankee, nuclear, plant, opponents, believe, that, nuclear, power, poses, many, threats, to, people, s, health, and, environment, such, as, the, risk, of, nuclear, weapons, proliferation, long, term, safe, waste, management, and, terrorism, in, the, future, they, also, contend, that, nuclear, power, plants, are, complex, systems, where, many, things, can, and, have, gone, wrong, costs, of, the, chernobyl, disaster, amount, to, 68, billion, as, of, 2019, and, are, increasing, the, fukushima, disaster, is, estimated, to, cost, taxpayers, 187, billion, and, radioactive, waste, management, is, estimated, to, cost, the, eureopean, union, nuclear, operators, 250, billion, by, 2050, however, in, countries, that, already, use, nuclear, energy, when, not, considering, reprocessing, intermediate, nuclear, waste, disposal, costs, could, be, relatively, fixed, to, certain, but, unknown, degrees, as, the, main, part, of, these, costs, stems, from, the, operation, of, the, intermediate, storage, facility, critics, find, that, one, of, the, largest, drawbacks, to, building, new, nuclear, fission, power, plants, are, the, large, construction, and, operating, costs, when, compared, to, alternatives, of, sustainable, energy, sources, further, costs, include, ongoing, research, and, development, expensive, reprocessing, in, cases, where, such, is, practiced, and, decommissioning, proponents, note, that, focussing, on, the, levelized, cost, of, energy, lcoe, however, ignores, the, value, premium, associated, with, 24, 7, dispatchable, electricity, and, the, cost, of, storage, and, backup, systems, necessary, to, integrate, variable, energy, sources, into, a, reliable, electrical, grid, nuclear, thus, remains, the, dispatchable, low, carbon, technology, with, the, lowest, expected, costs, in, 2025, only, large, hydro, reservoirs, can, provide, a, similar, contribution, at, comparable, costs, but, remain, highly, dependent, on, the, natural, endowments, of, individual, countries, overall, many, opponents, find, that, nuclear, energy, cannot, meaningfully, contribute, to, climate, change, mitigation, in, general, they, find, it, to, be, too, dangerous, too, expensive, to, take, too, long, for, deployment, to, be, an, obstacle, to, achieving, a, transition, towards, sustainability, and, carbon, neutrality, effectively, being, a, distracting, competition, for, resources, i, e, human, financial, time, infrastructure, and, expertise, for, the, deployment, and, development, of, alternative, sustainable, energy, system, technologies, such, as, for, wind, ocean, and, solar, including, e, g, floating, solar, as, well, as, ways, to, manage, their, intermittency, other, than, nuclear, baseload, generation, such, as, dispatchable, generation, renewables, diversification, super, grids, flexible, energy, demand, and, supply, regulating, smart, grids, and, energy, storage, technologies, nevertheless, there, is, ongoing, research, and, debate, over, costs, of, new, nuclear, especially, in, regions, where, i, a, seasonal, energy, storage, is, difficult, to, provide, and, which, aim, to, phase, out, fossil, fuels, in, favor, of, low, carbon, power, faster, than, the, global, average, some, find, that, financial, transition, costs, for, a, 100, renewables, based, european, energy, system, that, has, completely, phased, out, nuclear, energy, could, be, more, costly, by, 2050, based, on, current, technologies, i, e, not, considering, potential, advances, in, e, g, green, hydrogen, transmission, and, flexibility, capacities, ways, to, reduce, energy, needs, geothermal, energy, and, fusion, energy, when, the, grid, only, extends, across, europe, arguments, of, economics, and, safety, are, used, by, both, sides, of, the, debate, slowing, global, warming, requires, a, transition, to, a, low, carbon, economy, mainly, by, burning, far, less, fossil, fuel, limiting, global, warming, to, 1, 5, c, is, technically, possible, if, no, new, fossil, fuel, power, plants, are, built, from, 2019, this, has, generated, considerable, interest, and, dispute, in, determining, the, best, path, forward, to, rapidly, replace, fossil, based, fuels, in, the, global, energy, mix, with, intense, academic, debate, sometimes, the, iea, says, that, countries, without, nuclear, should, develop, it, as, well, as, their, renewable, power, world, total, primary, energy, supply, of, 162, 494, twh, or, 13, 792, mtoe, by, fuels, in, 2017, iea, 2019, 6, 8, several, studies, suggest, that, it, might, be, theoretically, possible, to, cover, a, majority, of, world, energy, generation, with, new, renewable, sources, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, has, said, that, if, governments, were, supportive, renewable, energy, supply, could, account, for, close, to, 80, of, the, world, s, energy, use, by, 2050, while, in, developed, nations, the, economically, feasible, geography, for, new, hydropower, is, lacking, with, every, geographically, suitable, area, largely, already, exploited, some, proponents, of, wind, and, solar, energy, claim, these, resources, alone, could, eliminate, the, need, for, nuclear, power, nuclear, power, is, comparable, to, and, in, some, cases, lower, than, many, renewable, energy, sources, in, terms, of, lives, lost, in, the, past, per, unit, of, electricity, delivered, depending, on, recycling, of, renewable, energy, technologies, nuclear, reactors, may, produce, a, much, smaller, volume, of, waste, although, much, more, toxic, expensive, to, manage, and, longer, lived, a, nuclear, plant, also, needs, to, be, disassembled, and, removed, and, much, of, the, disassembled, nuclear, plant, needs, to, be, stored, as, low, level, nuclear, waste, for, a, few, decades, the, disposal, and, management, of, the, wide, variety, of, radioactive, waste, of, which, there, are, over, one, quarter, of, a, million, tons, as, of, 2018, can, cause, future, damage, and, costs, across, the, world, for, over, or, during, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, possibly, over, a, million, years, due, to, issues, such, as, leakage, malign, retrieval, vulnerability, to, attacks, including, of, reprocessing, and, power, plants, groundwater, contamination, radiation, and, leakage, to, above, ground, brine, leakage, or, bacterial, corrosion, the, european, commission, joint, research, centre, found, that, as, of, 2021, the, necessary, technologies, for, geological, disposal, of, nuclear, waste, are, now, available, and, can, be, deployed, corrosion, experts, noted, in, 2020, that, putting, the, problem, of, storage, off, any, longer, isn, t, good, for, anyone, separated, plutonium, and, enriched, uranium, could, be, used, for, nuclear, weapons, which, even, with, the, current, centralized, control, e, g, state, level, and, level, of, prevalence, are, considered, to, be, a, difficult, and, substantial, global, risk, for, substantial, future, impacts, on, human, health, lives, civilization, and, the, environment, analysis, in, 2015, by, professor, barry, w, brook, and, colleagues, found, that, nuclear, energy, could, displace, or, remove, fossil, fuels, from, the, electric, grid, completely, within, 10, years, this, finding, was, based, on, the, historically, modest, and, proven, rate, at, which, nuclear, energy, was, added, in, france, and, sweden, during, their, building, programs, in, the, 1980s, in, a, similar, analysis, brook, had, earlier, determined, that, 50, of, all, global, energy, including, transportation, synthetic, fuels, etc, could, be, generated, within, approximately, 30, years, if, the, global, nuclear, fission, build, rate, was, identical, to, historical, proven, installation, rates, calculated, in, gw, per, year, per, unit, of, global, gdp, gw, year, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, conceptual, studies, for, 100, renewable, energy, systems, which, would, require, an, order, of, magnitude, more, costly, global, investment, per, year, which, has, no, historical, precedent, these, renewable, scenarios, would, also, need, far, greater, land, devoted, to, onshore, wind, and, onshore, solar, projects, brook, notes, that, the, principal, limitations, on, nuclear, fission, are, not, technical, economic, or, fuel, related, but, are, instead, linked, to, complex, issues, of, societal, acceptance, fiscal, and, political, inertia, and, inadequate, critical, evaluation, of, the, real, world, constraints, facing, low, carbon, alternatives, scientific, data, indicates, that, assuming, 2021, emissions, levels, humanity, only, has, a, carbon, budget, equivalent, to, 11, years, of, emissions, left, for, limiting, warming, to, 1, 5, c, while, the, construction, of, new, nuclear, reactors, took, a, median, of, 7, 2, 10, 9, years, in, 2018, 2020, substantially, longer, than, alongside, other, measures, scaling, up, the, deployment, of, wind, and, solar, especially, for, novel, reactor, types, as, well, as, being, more, risky, often, delayed, and, more, dependent, on, state, support, researchers, have, cautioned, that, novel, nuclear, technologies, which, have, been, in, development, since, decades, are, less, tested, have, higher, proliferation, risks, have, more, new, safety, problems, are, often, far, from, commercialization, and, are, more, expensive, are, not, available, in, time, critics, of, nuclear, energy, often, only, oppose, nuclear, fission, energy, but, not, nuclear, fusion, however, fusion, energy, is, unlikely, to, be, commercially, widespread, before, 2050, the, median, land, area, used, by, us, nuclear, power, stations, per, 1, gw, installed, capacity, is, 1, 3, square, miles, 3, 4, km, 2, to, generate, the, same, amount, of, electricity, annually, taking, into, account, capacity, factors, from, solar, pv, would, require, about, 60, square, miles, 160, km, 2, and, from, a, wind, farm, about, 310, square, miles, 800, km, 2, not, included, in, this, is, land, required, for, the, associated, transmission, lines, water, supply, rail, lines, mining, and, processing, of, nuclear, fuel, and, for, waste, disposal, current, fission, reactors, in, operation, around, the, world, are, second, or, third, generation, systems, with, most, of, the, first, generation, systems, having, been, already, retired, research, into, advanced, generation, iv, reactor, types, was, officially, started, by, the, generation, iv, international, forum, gif, based, on, eight, technology, goals, including, to, improve, economics, safety, proliferation, resistance, natural, resource, use, and, the, ability, to, consume, existing, nuclear, waste, in, the, production, of, electricity, most, of, these, reactors, differ, significantly, from, current, operating, light, water, reactors, and, are, expected, to, be, available, for, commercial, construction, after, 2030, hybrid, nuclear, power, is, a, proposed, means, of, generating, power, by, the, use, of, a, combination, of, nuclear, fusion, and, fission, processes, the, concept, dates, to, the, 1950s, and, was, briefly, advocated, by, hans, bethe, during, the, 1970s, but, largely, remained, unexplored, until, a, revival, of, interest, in, 2009, due, to, delays, in, the, realization, of, pure, fusion, when, a, sustained, nuclear, fusion, power, plant, is, built, it, has, the, potential, to, be, capable, of, extracting, all, the, fission, energy, that, remains, in, spent, fission, fuel, reducing, the, volume, of, nuclear, waste, by, orders, of, magnitude, and, more, importantly, eliminating, all, actinides, present, in, the, spent, fuel, substances, which, cause, security, concerns, nuclear, fusion, reactions, have, the, potential, to, be, safer, and, generate, less, radioactive, waste, than, fission, these, reactions, appear, potentially, viable, though, technically, quite, difficult, and, have, yet, to, be, created, on, a, scale, that, could, be, used, in, a, functional, power, plant, fusion, power, has, been, under, theoretical, and, experimental, investigation, since, the, 1950s, nuclear, fusion, research, is, underway, but, fusion, energy, is, not, likely, to, be, commercially, widespread, before, 2050, several, experimental, nuclear, fusion, reactors, and, facilities, exist, the, largest, and, most, ambitious, international, nuclear, fusion, project, currently, in, progress, is, iter, a, large, tokamak, under, construction, in, france, iter, is, planned, to, pave, the, way, for, commercial, fusion, power, by, demonstrating, self, sustained, nuclear, fusion, reactions, with, positive, energy, gain, construction, of, the, iter, facility, began, in, 2007, but, the, project, has, run, into, many, delays, and, budget, overruns, the, facility, is, now, not, expected, to, begin, operations, until, the, year, 2027, 11, years, after, initially, anticipated, a, follow, on, commercial, nuclear, fusion, power, station, demo, has, been, proposed, there, are, also, suggestions, for, a, power, plant, based, upon, a, different, fusion, approach, that, of, an, inertial, fusion, power, plant, fusion, powered, electricity, generation, was, initially, believed, to, be, readily, achievable, as, fission, electric, power, had, been, however, the, extreme, requirements, for, continuous,
