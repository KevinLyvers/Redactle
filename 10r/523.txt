a, battleship, is, a, large, heavily, armored, warship, with, a, main, battery, consisting, of, large, caliber, guns, designed, to, serve, as, capital, ships, with, the, most, intense, firepower, before, the, rise, of, supercarriers, battleships, were, among, the, largest, and, most, formidable, weapon, systems, ever, built, the, term, battleship, came, into, use, in, the, late, 1880s, to, describe, a, type, of, ironclad, warship, now, referred, to, by, historians, as, pre, dreadnought, battleships, in, 1906, the, commissioning, of, hms, dreadnought, into, the, united, kingdom, s, royal, navy, heralded, a, revolution, in, the, field, of, battleship, design, subsequent, battleship, designs, influenced, by, hms, dreadnought, were, referred, to, as, dreadnoughts, though, the, term, eventually, became, obsolete, as, dreadnoughts, became, the, only, type, of, battleship, in, common, use, battleships, dominated, naval, warfare, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, and, were, a, symbol, of, naval, dominance, and, national, might, and, for, decades, were, a, major, intimidation, factor, for, power, projection, in, both, diplomacy, and, military, strategy, a, global, arms, race, in, battleship, construction, began, in, europe, in, the, 1890s, and, culminated, at, the, decisive, battle, of, tsushima, in, 1905, the, outcome, of, which, significantly, influenced, the, design, of, hms, dreadnought, the, launch, of, dreadnought, in, 1906, commenced, a, new, naval, arms, race, three, major, fleet, actions, between, steel, battleships, took, place, the, long, range, gunnery, duel, at, the, battle, of, the, yellow, sea, in, 1904, the, decisive, battle, of, tsushima, in, 1905, both, during, the, russo, japanese, war, and, the, inconclusive, battle, of, jutland, in, 1916, during, the, first, world, war, jutland, was, the, largest, naval, battle, and, the, only, full, scale, clash, of, dreadnoughts, of, the, war, and, it, was, the, last, major, battle, in, naval, history, fought, primarily, by, battleships, the, naval, treaties, of, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, limited, the, number, of, battleships, though, technical, innovation, in, battleship, design, continued, both, the, allied, and, axis, powers, built, battleships, during, world, war, ii, though, the, increasing, importance, of, the, aircraft, carrier, meant, that, the, battleship, played, a, less, important, role, than, had, been, expected, in, that, conflict, the, value, of, the, battleship, has, been, questioned, even, during, their, heyday, there, were, few, of, the, decisive, fleet, battles, that, battleship, proponents, expected, and, used, to, justify, the, vast, resources, spent, on, building, battlefleets, even, in, spite, of, their, huge, firepower, and, protection, battleships, were, increasingly, vulnerable, to, much, smaller, and, relatively, inexpensive, weapons, initially, the, torpedo, and, the, naval, mine, and, later, attack, aircraft, and, the, guided, missile, the, growing, range, of, naval, engagements, led, to, the, aircraft, carrier, replacing, the, battleship, as, the, leading, capital, ship, during, world, war, ii, with, the, last, battleship, to, be, launched, being, hms, vanguard, in, 1944, four, battleships, were, retained, by, the, united, states, navy, until, the, end, of, the, cold, war, for, fire, support, purposes, and, were, last, used, in, combat, during, the, gulf, war, in, 1991, and, then, struck, from, the, u, s, naval, vessel, register, in, the, 2000s, many, world, war, ii, era, battleships, remain, today, as, museum, ships, a, ship, of, the, line, was, a, large, unarmored, wooden, sailing, ship, which, mounted, a, battery, of, up, to, 120, smoothbore, guns, and, carronades, which, came, to, prominence, with, the, adoption, of, line, of, battle, tactics, in, the, early, 17th, century, and, the, end, of, the, sailing, battleship, s, heyday, in, the, 1830s, from, 1794, the, alternative, term, line, of, battle, ship, was, contracted, informally, at, first, to, battle, ship, or, battleship, the, sheer, number, of, guns, fired, broadside, meant, a, ship, of, the, line, could, wreck, any, wooden, enemy, holing, her, hull, knocking, down, masts, wrecking, her, rigging, and, killing, her, crew, however, the, effective, range, of, the, guns, was, as, little, as, a, few, hundred, yards, so, the, battle, tactics, of, sailing, ships, depended, in, part, on, the, wind, over, time, ships, of, the, line, gradually, became, larger, and, carried, more, guns, but, otherwise, remained, quite, similar, the, first, major, change, to, the, ship, of, the, line, concept, was, the, introduction, of, steam, power, as, an, auxiliary, propulsion, system, steam, power, was, gradually, introduced, to, the, navy, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, initially, for, small, craft, and, later, for, frigates, the, french, navy, introduced, steam, to, the, line, of, battle, with, the, 90, gun, napol, on, in, 1850, the, first, true, steam, battleship, napol, on, was, armed, as, a, conventional, ship, of, the, line, but, her, steam, engines, could, give, her, a, speed, of, 12, knots, 22, km, h, regardless, of, the, wind, this, was, a, potentially, decisive, advantage, in, a, naval, engagement, the, introduction, of, steam, accelerated, the, growth, in, size, of, battleships, france, and, the, united, kingdom, were, the, only, countries, to, develop, fleets, of, wooden, steam, screw, battleships, although, several, other, navies, operated, small, numbers, of, screw, battleships, including, russia, 9, the, ottoman, empire, 3, sweden, 2, naples, 1, denmark, 1, and, austria, 1, the, adoption, of, steam, power, was, only, one, of, a, number, of, technological, advances, which, revolutionized, warship, design, in, the, 19th, century, the, ship, of, the, line, was, overtaken, by, the, ironclad, powered, by, steam, protected, by, metal, armor, and, armed, with, guns, firing, high, explosive, shells, guns, that, fired, explosive, or, incendiary, shells, were, a, major, threat, to, wooden, ships, and, these, weapons, quickly, became, widespread, after, the, introduction, of, 8, inch, shell, guns, as, part, of, the, standard, armament, of, french, and, american, line, of, battle, ships, in, 1841, in, the, crimean, war, six, line, of, battle, ships, and, two, frigates, of, the, russian, black, sea, fleet, destroyed, seven, turkish, frigates, and, three, corvettes, with, explosive, shells, at, the, battle, of, sinop, in, 1853, later, in, the, war, french, ironclad, floating, batteries, used, similar, weapons, against, the, defenses, at, the, battle, of, kinburn, nevertheless, wooden, hulled, ships, stood, up, comparatively, well, to, shells, as, shown, in, the, 1866, battle, of, lissa, where, the, modern, austrian, steam, two, decker, sms, kaiser, ranged, across, a, confused, battlefield, rammed, an, italian, ironclad, and, took, 80, hits, from, italian, ironclads, many, of, which, were, shells, but, including, at, least, one, 300, pound, shot, at, point, blank, range, despite, losing, her, bowsprit, and, her, foremast, and, being, set, on, fire, she, was, ready, for, action, again, the, very, next, day, the, development, of, high, explosive, shells, made, the, use, of, iron, armor, plate, on, warships, necessary, in, 1859, france, launched, gloire, the, first, ocean, going, ironclad, warship, she, had, the, profile, of, a, ship, of, the, line, cut, to, one, deck, due, to, weight, considerations, although, made, of, wood, and, reliant, on, sail, for, most, journeys, gloire, was, fitted, with, a, propeller, and, her, wooden, hull, was, protected, by, a, layer, of, thick, iron, armor, gloire, prompted, further, innovation, from, the, royal, navy, anxious, to, prevent, france, from, gaining, a, technological, lead, the, superior, armored, frigate, warrior, followed, gloire, by, only, 14, months, and, both, nations, embarked, on, a, program, of, building, new, ironclads, and, converting, existing, screw, ships, of, the, line, to, armored, frigates, within, two, years, italy, austria, spain, and, russia, had, all, ordered, ironclad, warships, and, by, the, time, of, the, famous, clash, of, the, uss, monitor, and, the, css, virginia, at, the, battle, of, hampton, roads, at, least, eight, navies, possessed, ironclad, ships, navies, experimented, with, the, positioning, of, guns, in, turrets, like, the, uss, monitor, central, batteries, or, barbettes, or, with, the, ram, as, the, principal, weapon, as, steam, technology, developed, masts, were, gradually, removed, from, battleship, designs, by, the, mid, 1870s, steel, was, used, as, a, construction, material, alongside, iron, and, wood, the, french, navy, s, redoutable, laid, down, in, 1873, and, launched, in, 1876, was, a, central, battery, and, barbette, warship, which, became, the, first, battleship, in, the, world, to, use, steel, as, the, principal, building, material, the, term, battleship, was, officially, adopted, by, the, royal, navy, in, the, re, classification, of, 1892, by, the, 1890s, there, was, an, increasing, similarity, between, battleship, designs, and, the, type, that, later, became, known, as, the, pre, dreadnought, battleship, emerged, these, were, heavily, armored, ships, mounting, a, mixed, battery, of, guns, in, turrets, and, without, sails, the, typical, first, class, battleship, of, the, pre, dreadnought, era, displaced, 15, 000, to, 17, 000, tons, had, a, speed, of, 16, knots, 30, km, h, and, an, armament, of, four, 12, inch, 305, mm, guns, in, two, turrets, fore, and, aft, with, a, mixed, caliber, secondary, battery, amidships, around, the, superstructure, an, early, design, with, superficial, similarity, to, the, pre, dreadnought, is, the, british, devastation, class, of, 1871, the, slow, firing, 12, inch, 305, mm, main, guns, were, the, principal, weapons, for, battleship, to, battleship, combat, the, intermediate, and, secondary, batteries, had, two, roles, against, major, ships, it, was, thought, a, hail, of, fire, from, quick, firing, secondary, weapons, could, distract, enemy, gun, crews, by, inflicting, damage, to, the, superstructure, and, they, would, be, more, effective, against, smaller, ships, such, as, cruisers, smaller, guns, 12, pounders, and, smaller, were, reserved, for, protecting, the, battleship, against, the, threat, of, torpedo, attack, from, destroyers, and, torpedo, boats, the, beginning, of, the, pre, dreadnought, era, coincided, with, britain, reasserting, her, naval, dominance, for, many, years, previously, britain, had, taken, naval, supremacy, for, granted, expensive, naval, projects, were, criticized, by, political, leaders, of, all, inclinations, however, in, 1888, a, war, scare, with, france, and, the, build, up, of, the, russian, navy, gave, added, impetus, to, naval, construction, and, the, british, naval, defence, act, of, 1889, laid, down, a, new, fleet, including, eight, new, battleships, the, principle, that, britain, s, navy, should, be, more, powerful, than, the, two, next, most, powerful, fleets, combined, was, established, this, policy, was, designed, to, deter, france, and, russia, from, building, more, battleships, but, both, nations, nevertheless, expanded, their, fleets, with, more, and, better, pre, dreadnoughts, in, the, 1890s, in, the, last, years, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, first, years, of, the, 20th, the, escalation, in, the, building, of, battleships, became, an, arms, race, between, britain, and, germany, the, german, naval, laws, of, 1890, and, 1898, authorized, a, fleet, of, 38, battleships, a, vital, threat, to, the, balance, of, naval, power, britain, answered, with, further, shipbuilding, but, by, the, end, of, the, pre, dreadnought, era, british, supremacy, at, sea, had, markedly, weakened, in, 1883, the, united, kingdom, had, 38, battleships, twice, as, many, as, france, and, almost, as, many, as, the, rest, of, the, world, put, together, in, 1897, britain, s, lead, was, far, smaller, due, to, competition, from, france, germany, and, russia, as, well, as, the, development, of, pre, dreadnought, fleets, in, italy, the, united, states, and, japan, the, ottoman, empire, spain, sweden, denmark, norway, the, netherlands, chile, and, brazil, all, had, second, rate, fleets, led, by, armored, cruisers, coastal, defence, ships, or, monitors, pre, dreadnoughts, continued, the, technical, innovations, of, the, ironclad, turrets, armor, plate, and, steam, engines, were, all, improved, over, the, years, and, torpedo, tubes, were, also, introduced, a, small, number, of, designs, including, the, american, kearsarge, and, virginia, classes, experimented, with, all, or, part, of, the, 8, inch, intermediate, battery, superimposed, over, the, 12, inch, primary, results, were, poor, recoil, factors, and, blast, effects, resulted, in, the, 8, inch, battery, being, completely, unusable, and, the, inability, to, train, the, primary, and, intermediate, armaments, on, different, targets, led, to, significant, tactical, limitations, even, though, such, innovative, designs, saved, weight, a, key, reason, for, their, inception, they, proved, too, cumbersome, in, practice, in, 1906, the, british, royal, navy, launched, the, revolutionary, hms, dreadnought, created, as, a, result, of, pressure, from, admiral, sir, john, jackie, fisher, hms, dreadnought, rendered, existing, battleships, obsolete, combining, an, all, big, gun, armament, of, ten, 12, inch, 305, mm, guns, with, unprecedented, speed, from, steam, turbine, engines, and, protection, she, prompted, navies, worldwide, to, re, evaluate, their, battleship, building, programs, while, the, japanese, had, laid, down, an, all, big, gun, battleship, satsuma, in, 1904, and, the, concept, of, an, all, big, gun, ship, had, been, in, circulation, for, several, years, it, had, yet, to, be, validated, in, combat, dreadnought, sparked, a, new, arms, race, principally, between, britain, and, germany, but, reflected, worldwide, as, the, new, class, of, warships, became, a, crucial, element, of, national, power, technical, development, continued, rapidly, through, the, dreadnought, era, with, steep, changes, in, armament, armor, and, propulsion, ten, years, after, dreadnought, s, commissioning, much, more, powerful, ships, the, super, dreadnoughts, were, being, built, in, the, first, years, of, the, 20th, century, several, navies, worldwide, experimented, with, the, idea, of, a, new, type, of, battleship, with, a, uniform, armament, of, very, heavy, guns, admiral, vittorio, cuniberti, the, italian, navy, s, chief, naval, architect, articulated, the, concept, of, an, all, big, gun, battleship, in, 1903, when, the, regia, marina, did, not, pursue, his, ideas, cuniberti, wrote, an, article, in, jane, s, proposing, an, ideal, future, british, battleship, a, large, armored, warship, of, 17, 000, tons, armed, solely, with, a, single, calibre, main, battery, twelve, 12, inch, guns, carrying, 300, millimetre, 12, in, belt, armor, and, capable, of, 24, knots, 44, km, h, the, russo, japanese, war, provided, operational, experience, to, validate, the, all, big, gun, concept, during, the, battle, of, the, yellow, sea, on, august, 10, 1904, admiral, togo, of, the, imperial, japanese, navy, commenced, deliberate, 12, inch, gun, fire, at, the, russian, flagship, tzesarevich, at, 14, 200, yards, 13, 000, meters, at, the, battle, of, tsushima, on, may, 27, 1905, russian, admiral, rozhestvensky, s, flagship, fired, the, first, 12, inch, guns, at, the, japanese, flagship, mikasa, at, 7, 000, meters, it, is, often, held, that, these, engagements, demonstrated, the, importance, of, the, 12, inch, 305, mm, gun, over, its, smaller, counterparts, though, some, historians, take, the, view, that, secondary, batteries, were, just, as, important, as, the, larger, weapons, when, dealing, with, smaller, fast, moving, torpedo, craft, such, was, the, case, albeit, unsuccessfully, when, the, russian, battleship, knyaz, suvorov, at, tsushima, had, been, sent, to, the, bottom, by, destroyer, launched, torpedoes, the, 1903, 04, design, also, retained, traditional, triple, expansion, steam, engines, as, early, as, 1904, jackie, fisher, had, been, convinced, of, the, need, for, fast, powerful, ships, with, an, all, big, gun, armament, if, tsushima, influenced, his, thinking, it, was, to, persuade, him, of, the, need, to, standardise, on, 12, inch, 305, mm, guns, fisher, s, concerns, were, submarines, and, destroyers, equipped, with, torpedoes, then, threatening, to, outrange, battleship, guns, making, speed, imperative, for, capital, ships, fisher, s, preferred, option, was, his, brainchild, the, battlecruiser, lightly, armored, but, heavily, armed, with, eight, 12, inch, guns, and, propelled, to, 25, knots, 46, km, h, by, steam, turbines, it, was, to, prove, this, revolutionary, technology, that, dreadnought, was, designed, in, january, 1905, laid, down, in, october, 1905, and, sped, to, completion, by, 1906, she, carried, ten, 12, inch, guns, had, an, 11, inch, armor, belt, and, was, the, first, large, ship, powered, by, turbines, she, mounted, her, guns, in, five, turrets, three, on, the, centerline, one, forward, two, aft, and, two, on, the, wings, giving, her, at, her, launch, twice, the, broadside, of, any, other, warship, she, retained, a, number, of, 12, pound, 3, inch, 76, mm, quick, firing, guns, for, use, against, destroyers, and, torpedo, boats, her, armor, was, heavy, enough, for, her, to, go, head, to, head, with, any, other, ship, in, a, gun, battle, and, conceivably, win, dreadnought, was, to, have, been, followed, by, three, invincible, class, battlecruisers, their, construction, delayed, to, allow, lessons, from, dreadnought, to, be, used, in, their, design, while, fisher, may, have, intended, dreadnought, to, be, the, last, royal, navy, battleship, the, design, was, so, successful, he, found, little, support, for, his, plan, to, switch, to, a, battlecruiser, navy, although, there, were, some, problems, with, the, ship, the, wing, turrets, had, limited, arcs, of, fire, and, strained, the, hull, when, firing, a, full, broadside, and, the, top, of, the, thickest, armor, belt, lay, below, the, waterline, at, full, load, the, royal, navy, promptly, commissioned, another, six, ships, to, a, similar, design, in, the, bellerophon, and, st, vincent, classes, an, american, design, south, carolina, authorized, in, 1905, and, laid, down, in, december, 1906, was, another, of, the, first, dreadnoughts, but, she, and, her, sister, michigan, were, not, launched, until, 1908, both, used, triple, expansion, engines, and, had, a, superior, layout, of, the, main, battery, dispensing, with, dreadnought, s, wing, turrets, they, thus, retained, the, same, broadside, despite, having, two, fewer, guns, in, 1897, before, the, revolution, in, design, brought, about, by, hms, dreadnought, the, royal, navy, had, 62, battleships, in, commission, or, building, a, lead, of, 26, over, france, and, 50, over, germany, from, the, 1906, launching, of, dreadnought, an, arms, race, with, major, strategic, consequences, was, prompted, major, naval, powers, raced, to, build, their, own, dreadnoughts, possession, of, modern, battleships, was, not, only, seen, as, vital, to, naval, power, but, also, as, with, nuclear, weapons, after, world, war, ii, represented, a, nation, s, standing, in, the, world, germany, france, japan, italy, austria, and, the, united, states, all, began, dreadnought, programmes, while, the, ottoman, empire, argentina, russia, brazil, and, chile, commissioned, dreadnoughts, to, be, built, in, british, and, american, yards, by, virtue, of, geography, the, royal, navy, was, able, to, use, her, imposing, battleship, and, battlecruiser, fleet, to, impose, a, strict, and, successful, naval, blockade, of, germany, and, kept, germany, s, smaller, battleship, fleet, bottled, up, in, the, north, sea, only, narrow, channels, led, to, the, atlantic, ocean, and, these, were, guarded, by, british, forces, both, sides, were, aware, that, because, of, the, greater, number, of, british, dreadnoughts, a, full, fleet, engagement, would, be, likely, to, result, in, a, british, victory, the, german, strategy, was, therefore, to, try, to, provoke, an, engagement, on, their, terms, either, to, induce, a, part, of, the, grand, fleet, to, enter, battle, alone, or, to, fight, a, pitched, battle, near, the, german, coastline, where, friendly, minefields, torpedo, boats, and, submarines, could, be, used, to, even, the, odds, this, did, not, happen, however, due, in, large, part, to, the, necessity, to, keep, submarines, for, the, atlantic, campaign, submarines, were, the, only, vessels, in, the, imperial, german, navy, able, to, break, out, and, raid, british, commerce, in, force, but, even, though, they, sank, many, merchant, ships, they, could, not, successfully, counter, blockade, the, united, kingdom, the, royal, navy, successfully, adopted, convoy, tactics, to, combat, germany, s, submarine, counter, blockade, and, eventually, defeated, it, this, was, in, stark, contrast, to, britain, s, successful, blockade, of, germany, the, first, two, years, of, war, saw, the, royal, navy, s, battleships, and, battlecruisers, regularly, sweep, the, north, sea, making, sure, that, no, german, ships, could, get, in, or, out, only, a, few, german, surface, ships, that, were, already, at, sea, such, as, the, famous, light, cruiser, sms, emden, were, able, to, raid, commerce, even, some, of, those, that, did, manage, to, get, out, were, hunted, down, by, battlecruisers, as, in, the, battle, of, the, falklands, december, 7, 1914, the, results, of, sweeping, actions, in, the, north, sea, were, battles, including, the, heligoland, bight, and, dogger, bank, and, german, raids, on, the, english, coast, all, of, which, were, attempts, by, the, germans, to, lure, out, portions, of, the, grand, fleet, in, an, attempt, to, defeat, the, royal, navy, in, detail, on, may, 31, 1916, a, further, attempt, to, draw, british, ships, into, battle, on, german, terms, resulted, in, a, clash, of, the, battlefleets, in, the, battle, of, jutland, the, german, fleet, withdrew, to, port, after, two, short, encounters, with, the, british, fleet, less, than, two, months, later, the, germans, once, again, attempted, to, draw, portions, of, the, grand, fleet, into, battle, the, resulting, action, of, 19, august, 1916, proved, inconclusive, this, reinforced, german, determination, not, to, engage, in, a, fleet, to, fleet, battle, in, the, other, naval, theatres, there, were, no, decisive, pitched, battles, in, the, black, sea, engagement, between, russian, and, ottoman, battleships, was, restricted, to, skirmishes, in, the, baltic, sea, action, was, largely, limited, to, the, raiding, of, convoys, and, the, laying, of, defensive, minefields, the, only, significant, clash, of, battleship, squadrons, there, was, the, battle, of, moon, sound, at, which, one, russian, pre, dreadnought, was, lost, the, adriatic, was, in, a, sense, the, mirror, of, the, north, sea, the, austro, hungarian, dreadnought, fleet, remained, bottled, up, by, the, british, and, french, blockade, and, in, the, mediterranean, the, most, important, use, of, battleships, was, in, support, of, the, amphibious, assault, on, gallipoli, in, september, 1914, the, threat, posed, to, surface, ships, by, german, u, boats, was, confirmed, by, successful, attacks, on, british, cruisers, including, the, sinking, of, three, british, armored, cruisers, by, the, german, submarine, sm, u, 9, in, less, than, an, hour, the, british, super, dreadnought, hms, audacious, soon, followed, suit, as, she, struck, a, mine, laid, by, a, german, u, boat, in, october, 1914, and, sank, the, threat, that, german, u, boats, posed, to, british, dreadnoughts, was, enough, to, cause, the, royal, navy, to, change, their, strategy, and, tactics, in, the, north, sea, to, reduce, the, risk, of, u, boat, attack, further, near, misses, from, submarine, attacks, on, battleships, and, casualties, amongst, cruisers, led, to, growing, concern, in, the, royal, navy, about, the, vulnerability, of, battleships, as, the, war, wore, on, however, it, turned, out, that, whilst, submarines, did, prove, to, be, a, very, dangerous, threat, to, older, pre, dreadnought, battleships, as, shown, by, examples, such, as, the, sinking, of, mes, diye, which, was, caught, in, the, dardanelles, by, a, british, submarine, and, hms, majestic, and, hms, triumph, were, torpedoed, by, u, 21, as, well, as, hms, formidable, hms, cornwallis, hms, britannia, etc, the, threat, posed, to, dreadnought, battleships, proved, to, have, been, largely, a, false, alarm, hms, audacious, turned, out, to, be, the, only, dreadnought, sunk, by, a, submarine, in, world, war, i, while, battleships, were, never, intended, for, anti, submarine, warfare, there, was, one, instance, of, a, submarine, being, sunk, by, a, dreadnought, battleship, hms, dreadnought, rammed, and, sank, the, german, submarine, u, 29, on, march, 18, 1915, off, the, moray, firth, whilst, the, escape, of, the, german, fleet, from, the, superior, british, firepower, at, jutland, was, effected, by, the, german, cruisers, and, destroyers, successfully, turning, away, the, british, battleships, the, german, attempt, to, rely, on, u, boat, attacks, on, the, british, fleet, failed, torpedo, boats, did, have, some, successes, against, battleships, in, world, war, i, as, demonstrated, by, the, sinking, of, the, british, pre, dreadnought, hms, goliath, by, mu, venet, i, mill, ye, during, the, dardanelles, campaign, and, the, destruction, of, the, austro, hungarian, dreadnought, sms, szent, istv, n, by, italian, motor, torpedo, boats, in, june, 1918, in, large, fleet, actions, however, destroyers, and, torpedo, boats, were, usually, unable, to, get, close, enough, to, the, battleships, to, damage, them, the, only, battleship, sunk, in, a, fleet, action, by, either, torpedo, boats, or, destroyers, was, the, obsolescent, german, pre, dreadnought, sms, pommern, she, was, sunk, by, destroyers, during, the, night, phase, of, the, battle, of, jutland, the, german, high, seas, fleet, for, their, part, were, determined, not, to, engage, the, british, without, the, assistance, of, submarines, and, since, the, submarines, were, needed, more, for, raiding, commercial, traffic, the, fleet, stayed, in, port, for, much, of, the, war, for, many, years, germany, simply, had, no, battleships, the, armistice, with, germany, required, that, most, of, the, high, seas, fleet, be, disarmed, and, interned, in, a, neutral, port, largely, because, no, neutral, port, could, be, found, the, ships, remained, in, british, custody, in, scapa, flow, scotland, the, treaty, of, versailles, specified, that, the, ships, should, be, handed, over, to, the, british, instead, most, of, them, were, scuttled, by, their, german, crews, on, june, 21, 1919, just, before, the, signature, of, the, peace, treaty, the, treaty, also, limited, the, german, navy, and, prevented, germany, from, building, or, possessing, any, capital, ships, the, inter, war, period, saw, the, battleship, subjected, to, strict, international, limitations, to, prevent, a, costly, arms, race, breaking, out, while, the, victors, were, not, limited, by, the, treaty, of, versailles, many, of, the, major, naval, powers, were, crippled, after, the, war, faced, with, the, prospect, of, a, naval, arms, race, against, the, united, kingdom, and, japan, which, would, in, turn, have, led, to, a, possible, pacific, war, the, united, states, was, keen, to, conclude, the, washington, naval, treaty, of, 1922, this, treaty, limited, the, number, and, size, of, battleships, that, each, major, nation, could, possess, and, required, britain, to, accept, parity, with, the, u, s, and, to, abandon, the, british, alliance, with, japan, the, washington, treaty, was, followed, by, a, series, of, other, naval, treaties, including, the, first, geneva, naval, conference, 1927, the, first, london, naval, treaty, 1930, the, second, geneva, naval, conference, 1932, and, finally, the, second, london, naval, treaty, 1936, which, all, set, limits, on, major, warships, these, treaties, became, effectively, obsolete, on, september, 1, 1939, at, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, but, the, ship, classifications, that, had, been, agreed, upon, still, apply, the, treaty, limitations, meant, that, fewer, new, battleships, were, launched, in, 1919, 1939, than, in, 1905, 1914, the, treaties, also, inhibited, development, by, imposing, upper, limits, on, the, weights, of, ships, designs, like, the, projected, british, n3, class, battleship, the, first, american, south, dakota, class, and, the, japanese, kii, class, all, of, which, continued, the, trend, to, larger, ships, with, bigger, guns, and, thicker, armor, never, got, off, the, drawing, board, those, designs, which, were, commissioned, during, this, period, were, referred, to, as, treaty, battleships, as, early, as, 1914, the, british, admiral, percy, scott, predicted, that, battleships, would, soon, be, made, irrelevant, by, aircraft, by, the, end, of, world, war, i, aircraft, had, successfully, adopted, the, torpedo, as, a, weapon, in, 1921, the, italian, general, and, air, theorist, giulio, douhet, completed, a, hugely, influential, treatise, on, strategic, bombing, titled, the, command, of, the, air, which, foresaw, the, dominance, of, air, power, over, naval, units, in, the, 1920s, general, billy, mitchell, of, the, united, states, army, air, corps, believing, that, air, forces, had, rendered, navies, around, the, world, obsolete, testified, in, front, of, congress, that, 1, 000, bombardment, airplanes, can, be, built, and, operated, for, about, the, price, of, one, battleship, and, that, a, squadron, of, these, bombers, could, sink, a, battleship, making, for, more, efficient, use, of, government, funds, this, infuriated, the, u, s, navy, but, mitchell, was, nevertheless, allowed, to, conduct, a, careful, series, of, bombing, tests, alongside, navy, and, marine, bombers, in, 1921, he, bombed, and, sank, numerous, ships, including, the, unsinkable, german, world, war, i, battleship, sms, ostfriesland, and, the, american, pre, dreadnought, alabama, although, mitchell, had, required, war, time, conditions, the, ships, sunk, were, obsolete, stationary, defenseless, and, had, no, damage, control, the, sinking, of, ostfriesland, was, accomplished, by, violating, an, agreement, that, would, have, allowed, navy, engineers, to, examine, the, effects, of, various, munitions, mitchell, s, airmen, disregarded, the, rules, and, sank, the, ship, within, minutes, in, a, coordinated, attack, the, stunt, made, headlines, and, mitchell, declared, no, surface, vessels, can, exist, wherever, air, forces, acting, from, land, bases, are, able, to, attack, them, while, far, from, conclusive, mitchell, s, test, was, significant, because, it, put, proponents, of, the, battleship, against, naval, aviation, on, the, defensive, rear, admiral, william, a, moffett, used, public, relations, against, mitchell, to, make, headway, toward, expansion, of, the, u, s, navy, s, nascent, aircraft, carrier, program, the, royal, navy, united, states, navy, and, imperial, japanese, navy, extensively, upgraded, and, modernized, their, world, war, i, era, battleships, during, the, 1930s, among, the, new, features, were, an, increased, tower, height, and, stability, for, the, optical, rangefinder, equipment, for, gunnery, control, more, armor, especially, around, turrets, to, protect, against, plunging, fire, and, aerial, bombing, and, additional, anti, aircraft, weapons, some, british, ships, received, a, large, block, superstructure, nicknamed, the, queen, anne, s, castle, such, as, in, queen, elizabeth, and, warspite, which, would, be, used, in, the, new, conning, towers, of, the, king, george, v, class, fast, battleships, external, bulges, were, added, to, improve, both, buoyancy, to, counteract, weight, increase, and, provide, underwater, protection, against, mines, and, torpedoes, the, japanese, rebuilt, all, of, their, battleships, plus, their, battlecruisers, with, distinctive, pagoda, structures, though, the, hiei, received, a, more, modern, bridge, tower, that, would, influence, the, new, yamato, class, bulges, were, fitted, including, steel, tube, arrays, to, improve, both, underwater, and, vertical, protection, along, the, waterline, the, u, s, experimented, with, cage, masts, and, later, tripod, masts, though, after, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, some, of, the, most, severely, damaged, ships, such, as, west, virginia, and, california, were, rebuilt, with, tower, masts, for, an, appearance, similar, to, their, iowa, class, contemporaries, radar, which, was, effective, beyond, visual, range, and, effective, in, complete, darkness, or, adverse, weather, was, introduced, to, supplement, optical, fire, control, even, when, war, threatened, again, in, the, late, 1930s, battleship, construction, did, not, regain, the, level, of, importance, it, had, held, in, the, years, before, world, war, i, the, building, holiday, imposed, by, the, naval, treaties, meant, the, capacity, of, dockyards, worldwide, had, shrunk, and, the, strategic, position, had, changed, in, germany, the, ambitious, plan, z, for, naval, rearmament, was, abandoned, in, favor, of, a, strategy, of, submarine, warfare, supplemented, by, the, use, of, battlecruisers, and, commerce, raiding, in, particular, by, bismarck, class, battleships, in, britain, the, most, pressing, need, was, for, air, defenses, and, convoy, escorts, to, safeguard, the, civilian, population, from, bombing, or, starvation, and, re, armament, construction, plans, consisted, of, five, ships, of, the, king, george, v, class, it, was, in, the, mediterranean, that, navies, remained, most, committed, to, battleship, warfare, france, intended, to, build, six, battleships, of, the, dunkerque, and, richelieu, classes, and, the, italians, four, littorio, class, ships, neither, navy, built, significant, aircraft, carriers, the, u, s, preferred, to, spend, limited, funds, on, aircraft, carriers, until, the, south, dakota, class, japan, also, prioritising, aircraft, carriers, nevertheless, began, work, on, three, mammoth, yamato, s, although, the, third, shinano, was, later, completed, as, a, carrier, and, a, planned, fourth, was, cancelled, at, the, outbreak, of, the, spanish, civil, war, the, spanish, navy, included, only, two, small, dreadnought, battleships, espa, a, and, jaime, i, espa, a, originally, named, alfonso, xiii, by, then, in, reserve, at, the, northwestern, naval, base, of, el, ferrol, fell, into, nationalist, hands, in, july, 1936, the, crew, aboard, jaime, i, remained, loyal, to, the, republic, killed, their, officers, who, apparently, supported, franco, s, attempted, coup, and, joined, the, republican, navy, thus, each, side, had, one, battleship, however, the, republican, navy, generally, lacked, experienced, officers, the, spanish, battleships, mainly, restricted, themselves, to, mutual, blockades, convoy, escort, duties, and, shore, bombardment, rarely, in, direct, fighting, against, other, surface, units, in, april, 1937, espa, a, ran, into, a, mine, laid, by, friendly, forces, and, sank, with, little, loss, of, life, in, may, 1937, jaime, i, was, damaged, by, nationalist, air, attacks, and, a, grounding, incident, the, ship, was, forced, to, go, back, to, port, to, be, repaired, there, she, was, again, hit, by, several, aerial, bombs, it, was, then, decided, to, tow, the, battleship, to, a, more, secure, port, but, during, the, transport, she, suffered, an, internal, explosion, that, caused, 300, deaths, and, her, total, loss, several, italian, and, german, capital, ships, participated, in, the, non, intervention, blockade, on, may, 29, 1937, two, republican, aircraft, managed, to, bomb, the, german, pocket, battleship, deutschland, outside, ibiza, causing, severe, damage, and, loss, of, life, admiral, scheer, retaliated, two, days, later, by, bombarding, almer, a, causing, much, destruction, and, the, resulting, deutschland, incident, meant, the, end, of, german, and, italian, participation, in, non, intervention, the, schleswig, holstein, an, obsolete, pre, dreadnought, fired, the, first, shots, of, world, war, ii, with, the, bombardment, of, the, polish, garrison, at, westerplatte, and, the, final, surrender, of, the, japanese, empire, took, place, aboard, a, united, states, navy, battleship, uss, missouri, between, those, two, events, it, had, become, clear, that, aircraft, carriers, were, the, new, principal, ships, of, the, fleet, and, that, battleships, now, performed, a, secondary, role, battleships, played, a, part, in, major, engagements, in, atlantic, pacific, and, mediterranean, theaters, in, the, atlantic, the, germans, used, their, battleships, as, independent, commerce, raiders, however, clashes, between, battleships, were, of, little, strategic, importance, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, was, fought, between, destroyers, and, submarines, and, most, of, the, decisive, fleet, clashes, of, the, pacific, war, were, determined, by, aircraft, carriers, in, the, first, year, of, the, war, armored, warships, defied, predictions, that, aircraft, would, dominate, naval, warfare, scharnhorst, and, gneisenau, surprised, and, sank, the, aircraft, carrier, glorious, off, western, norway, in, june, 1940, this, engagement, marked, the, only, time, a, fleet, carrier, was, sunk, by, surface, gunnery, in, the, attack, on, mers, el, k, bir, british, battleships, opened, fire, on, the, french, battleships, in, the, harbor, near, oran, in, algeria, with, their, heavy, guns, the, fleeing, french, ships, were, then, pursued, by, planes, from, aircraft, carriers, the, subsequent, years, of, the, war, saw, many, demonstrations, of, the, maturity, of, the, aircraft, carrier, as, a, strategic, naval, weapon, and, its, effectiveness, against, battleships, the, british, air, attack, on, the, italian, naval, base, at, taranto, sank, one, italian, battleship, and, damaged, two, more, the, same, swordfish, torpedo, bombers, played, a, crucial, role, in, sinking, the, german, battleship, bismarck, on, december, 7, 1941, the, japanese, launched, a, surprise, attack, on, pearl, harbor, within, a, short, time, five, of, eight, u, s, battleships, were, sunk, or, sinking, with, the, rest, damaged, all, three, american, aircraft, carriers, were, out, to, sea, however, and, evaded, destruction, the, sinking, of, the, british, battleship, prince, of, wales, and, battlecruiser, repulse, demonstrated, the, vulnerability, of, a, battleship, to, air, attack, while, at, sea, without, sufficient, air, cover, settling, the, argument, begun, by, mitchell, in, 1921, both, warships, were, under, way, and, en, route, to, attack, the, japanese, amphibious, force, that, had, invaded, malaya, when, they, were, caught, by, japanese, land, based, bombers, and, torpedo, bombers, on, december, 10, 1941, at, many, of, the, early, crucial, battles, of, the, pacific, for, instance, coral, sea, and, midway, battleships, were, either, absent, or, overshadowed, as, carriers, launched, wave, after, wave, of, planes, into, the, attack, at, a, range, of, hundreds, of, miles, in, later, battles, in, the, pacific, battleships, primarily, performed, shore, bombardment, in, support, of, amphibious, landings, and, provided, anti, aircraft, defense, as, escort, for, the, carriers, even, the, largest, battleships, ever, constructed, japan, s, yamato, class, which, carried, a, main, battery, of, nine, 18, inch, 46, cm, guns, and, were, designed, as, a, principal, strategic, weapon, were, never, given, a, chance, to, show, their, potential, in, the, decisive, battleship, action, that, figured, in, japanese, pre, war, planning, the, last, battleship, confrontation, in, history, was, the, battle, of, surigao, strait, on, october, 25, 1944, in, which, a, numerically, and, technically, superior, american, battleship, group, destroyed, a, lesser, japanese, battleship, group, by, gunfire, after, it, had, already, been, devastated, by, destroyer, torpedo, attacks, all, but, one, of, the, american, battleships, in, this, confrontation, had, previously, been, sunk, during, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, and, subsequently, raised, and, repaired, mississippi, fired, the, last, major, caliber, salvo, of, this, battle, in, april, 1945, during, the, battle, for, okinawa, the, world, s, most, powerful, battleship, the, yamato, was, sent, out, on, a, suicide, mission, against, a, massive, u, s, force, and, sunk, by, overwhelming, pressure, from, carrier, aircraft, with, nearly, all, hands, lost, after, that, japanese, fleet, remaining, in, the, mainland, was, also, destroyed, by, the, us, naval, air, force, after, world, war, ii, several, navies, retained, their, existing, battleships, but, they, were, no, longer, strategically, dominant, military, assets, it, soon, became, apparent, that, they, were, no, longer, worth, the, considerable, cost, of, construction, and, maintenance, and, only, one, new, battleship, was, commissioned, after, the, war, hms, vanguard, during, the, war, it, had, been, demonstrated, that, battleship, on, battleship, engagements, like, leyte, gulf, or, the, sinking, of, hms, hood, were, the, exception, and, not, the, rule, and, with, the, growing, role, of, aircraft, engagement, ranges, were, becoming, longer, and, longer, making, heavy, gun, armament, irrelevant, the, armor, of, a, battleship, was, equally, irrelevant, in, the, face, of, a, nuclear, attack, as, tactical, missiles, with, a, range, of, 100, kilometres, 60, mi, or, more, could, be, mounted, on, the, soviet, kildin, class, destroyer, and, whiskey, class, submarines, by, the, end, of, the, 1950s, smaller, vessel, classes, such, as, destroyers, which, formerly, offered, no, noteworthy, opposition, to, battleships, now, were, capable, of, eliminating, battleships, from, outside, the, range, of, the, ship, s, heavy, guns, the, remaining, battleships, met, a, variety, of, ends, uss, arkansas, and, nagato, were, sunk, during, the, testing, of, nuclear, weapons, in, operation, crossroads, in, 1946, both, battleships, proved, resistant, to, nuclear, air, burst, but, vulnerable, to, underwater, nuclear, explosions, in, the, case, of, arkansas, vulnerable, due, to, her, proximity, to, the, bomb, crushing, flipping, and, sinking, her, in, less, than, a, second, the, giulio, cesare, was, taken, by, the, soviets, as, reparations, and, renamed, novorossiysk, she, was, sunk, by, a, leftover, german, mine, in, the, black, sea, on, october, 29, 1955, the, two, andrea, doria, class, ships, were, scrapped, in, 1956, the, french,

the, presence, of, the, battleship, was, a, potential, threat, to, any, convoy, escorted, by, any, vessels, other, than, capital, ships, this, concept, of, potential, threat, can, be, further, generalized, to, the, mere, existence, as, opposed, to, presence, of, a, powerful, fleet, tying, the, opposing, fleet, down, this, concept, came, to, be, known, as, a, fleet, in, being, an, idle, yet, mighty, fleet, forcing, others, to, spend, time, resource, and, effort, to, actively, guard, against, it, mahan, went, on, to, say, victory, could, only, be, achieved, by, engagements, between, battleships, which, came, to, be, known, as, the, decisive, battle, doctrine, in, some, navies, while, targeting, merchant, ships, commerce, raiding, or, guerre, de, course, as, posited, by, the, jeune, cole, could, never, succeed, mahan, was, highly, influential, in, naval, and, political, circles, throughout, the, age, of, the, battleship, calling, for, a, large, fleet, of, the, most, powerful, battleships, possible, mahan, s, work, developed, in, the, late, 1880s, and, by, the, end, of, the, 1890s, it, had, acquired, much, international, influence, on, naval, strategy, in, the, end, it, was, adopted, by, many, major, navies, notably, the, british, american, german, and, japanese, the, strength, of, mahanian, opinion, was, important, in, the, development, of, the, battleships, arms, races, and, equally, important, in, the, agreement, of, the, powers, to, limit, battleship, numbers, in, the, interwar, era, the, fleet, in, being, suggested, battleships, could, simply, by, their, existence, tie, down, superior, enemy, resources, this, in, turn, was, believed, to, be, able, to, tip, the, balance, of, a, conflict, even, without, a, battle, this, suggested, even, for, inferior, naval, powers, a, battleship, fleet, could, have, important, strategic, effect, while, the, role, of, battleships, in, both, world, wars, reflected, mahanian, doctrine, the, details, of, battleship, deployment, were, more, complex, unlike, ships, of, the, line, the, battleships, of, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, had, significant, vulnerability, to, torpedoes, and, mines, because, efficient, mines, and, torpedoes, did, not, exist, before, that, which, could, be, used, by, relatively, small, and, inexpensive, craft, the, jeune, cole, doctrine, of, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, recommended, placing, torpedo, boats, alongside, battleships, these, would, hide, behind, the, larger, ships, until, gun, smoke, obscured, visibility, enough, for, them, to, dart, out, and, fire, their, torpedoes, while, this, tactic, was, made, less, effective, by, the, development, of, smokeless, propellant, the, threat, from, more, capable, torpedo, craft, later, including, submarines, remained, by, the, 1890s, the, royal, navy, had, developed, the, first, destroyers, which, were, initially, designed, to, intercept, and, drive, off, any, attacking, torpedo, boats, during, the, first, world, war, and, subsequently, battleships, were, rarely, deployed, without, a, protective, screen, of, destroyers, battleship, doctrine, emphasized, the, concentration, of, the, battlegroup, in, order, for, this, concentrated, force, to, be, able, to, bring, its, power, to, bear, on, a, reluctant, opponent, or, to, avoid, an, encounter, with, a, stronger, enemy, fleet, battlefleets, needed, some, means, of, locating, enemy, ships, beyond, horizon, range, this, was, provided, by, scouting, forces, at, various, stages, battlecruisers, cruisers, destroyers, airships, submarines, and, aircraft, were, all, used, with, the, development, of, radio, direction, finding, and, traffic, analysis, would, come, into, play, as, well, so, even, shore, stations, broadly, speaking, joined, the, battlegroup, so, for, most, of, their, history, battleships, operated, surrounded, by, squadrons, of, destroyers, and, cruisers, the, north, sea, campaign, of, the, first, world, war, illustrates, how, despite, this, support, the, threat, of, mine, and, torpedo, attack, and, the, failure, to, integrate, or, appreciate, the, capabilities, of, new, techniques, seriously, inhibited, the, operations, of, the, royal, navy, grand, fleet, the, greatest, battleship, fleet, of, its, time, the, presence, of, battleships, had, a, great, psychological, and, diplomatic, impact, similar, to, possessing, nuclear, weapons, today, the, ownership, of, battleships, served, to, enhance, a, nation, s, force, projection, even, during, the, cold, war, the, psychological, impact, of, a, battleship, was, significant, in, 1946, uss, missouri, was, dispatched, to, deliver, the, remains, of, the, ambassador, from, turkey, and, her, presence, in, turkish, and, greek, waters, staved, off, a, possible, soviet, thrust, into, the, balkan, region, in, september, 1983, when, druze, militia, in, lebanon, s, shouf, mountains, fired, upon, u, s, marine, peacekeepers, the, arrival, of, uss, new, jersey, stopped, the, firing, gunfire, from, new, jersey, later, killed, militia, leaders, battleships, were, the, largest, and, most, complex, and, hence, the, most, expensive, warships, of, their, time, as, a, result, the, value, of, investment, in, battleships, has, always, been, contested, as, the, french, politician, etienne, lamy, wrote, in, 1879, the, construction, of, battleships, is, so, costly, their, effectiveness, so, uncertain, and, of, such, short, duration, that, the, enterprise, of, creating, an, armored, fleet, seems, to, leave, fruitless, the, perseverance, of, a, people, the, jeune, cole, school, of, thought, of, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, sought, alternatives, to, the, crippling, expense, and, debatable, utility, of, a, conventional, battlefleet, it, proposed, what, would, nowadays, be, termed, a, sea, denial, strategy, based, on, fast, long, ranged, cruisers, for, commerce, raiding, and, torpedo, boat, flotillas, to, attack, enemy, ships, attempting, to, blockade, french, ports, the, ideas, of, the, jeune, cole, were, ahead, of, their, time, it, was, not, until, the, 20th, century, that, efficient, mines, torpedoes, submarines, and, aircraft, were, available, that, allowed, similar, ideas, to, be, effectively, implemented, the, determination, of, powers, such, as, germany, to, build, battlefleets, with, which, to, confront, much, stronger, rivals, has, been, criticized, by, historians, who, emphasise, the, futility, of, investment, in, a, battlefleet, that, has, no, chance, of, matching, its, opponent, in, an, actual, battle
