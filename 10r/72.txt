mac, operating, systems, were, developed, by, apple, inc, in, a, succession, of, two, major, series, in, 1984, apple, debuted, the, operating, system, that, is, now, known, as, the, classic, mac, os, with, its, release, of, the, original, macintosh, system, software, the, system, rebranded, mac, os, in, 1997, was, pre, installed, on, every, macintosh, until, 2002, and, offered, on, macintosh, clones, shortly, in, the, 1990s, it, was, noted, for, its, ease, of, use, and, also, criticized, for, its, lack, of, modern, technologies, compared, to, its, competitors, the, current, mac, operating, system, is, macos, originally, named, mac, os, x, until, 2012, and, then, os, x, until, 2016, it, was, developed, between, 1997, and, 2001, after, apple, s, purchase, of, next, it, brought, an, entirely, new, architecture, based, on, nextstep, a, unix, system, that, eliminated, many, of, the, technical, challenges, that, the, classic, mac, os, faced, such, as, problems, with, memory, management, the, current, macos, is, pre, installed, with, every, mac, and, receives, a, major, update, annually, it, is, the, basis, of, apple, s, current, system, software, for, its, other, devices, ios, ipados, watchos, and, tvos, prior, to, the, introduction, of, mac, os, x, apple, experimented, with, several, other, concepts, releasing, different, products, designed, to, bring, the, macintosh, interface, or, applications, to, unix, like, systems, or, vice, versa, a, ux, mae, and, mklinux, apple, s, effort, to, expand, upon, and, develop, a, replacement, for, its, classic, mac, os, in, the, 1990s, led, to, a, few, cancelled, projects, code, named, star, trek, taligent, and, copland, although, the, classic, mac, os, and, macos, mac, os, x, have, different, architectures, they, share, a, common, set, of, gui, principles, including, a, menu, bar, across, the, top, of, the, screen, the, finder, shell, featuring, a, desktop, metaphor, that, represents, files, and, applications, using, icons, and, relates, concepts, like, directories, and, file, deletion, to, real, world, objects, like, folders, and, a, trash, can, and, overlapping, windows, for, multitasking, before, the, arrival, of, the, macintosh, in, 1984, apple, s, history, of, operating, systems, began, with, its, apple, ii, series, computers, in, 1977, which, run, apple, dos, prodos, and, gs, os, the, apple, iii, in, 1980, runs, apple, sos, and, the, lisa, in, 1983, which, runs, lisa, os, and, later, macworks, xl, a, macintosh, emulator, apple, developed, the, newton, os, for, its, newton, personal, digital, assistant, from, 1993, to, 1997, apple, launched, several, new, operating, systems, based, on, the, core, of, macos, including, ios, in, 2007, for, its, iphone, ipad, and, ipod, touch, mobile, devices, and, in, 2017, for, its, homepod, smart, speakers, watchos, in, 2015, for, the, apple, watch, and, tvos, in, 2015, for, the, apple, tv, set, top, box, the, classic, mac, os, is, the, original, macintosh, operating, system, introduced, in, 1984, alongside, the, first, macintosh, and, remained, in, primary, use, on, macs, until, mac, os, x, in, 2001, apple, released, the, original, macintosh, on, january, 24, 1984, its, early, system, software, is, partially, based, on, lisa, os, and, inspired, by, the, alto, computer, which, former, apple, ceo, steve, jobs, previewed, at, xerox, parc, it, was, originally, named, system, software, or, simply, system, apple, rebranded, it, as, mac, os, in, 1996, due, in, part, to, its, macintosh, clone, program, that, ended, one, year, later, classic, mac, os, is, characterized, by, its, monolithic, design, initial, versions, of, the, system, software, run, one, application, at, a, time, system, 5, introduced, cooperative, multitasking, system, 7, supports, 32, bit, memory, addressing, and, virtual, memory, allowing, larger, programs, later, updates, to, the, system, 7, enable, the, transition, to, the, powerpc, architecture, the, system, was, considered, user, friendly, but, its, architectural, limitations, were, critiqued, such, as, limited, memory, management, lack, of, protected, memory, and, access, controls, and, susceptibility, to, conflicts, among, extensions, nine, major, versions, of, the, classic, mac, os, were, released, the, name, classic, that, now, signifies, the, system, as, a, whole, is, a, reference, to, a, compatibility, layer, that, helped, ease, the, transition, to, mac, os, x, the, system, was, launched, as, mac, os, x, renamed, os, x, from, 2012, 2016, and, then, renamed, macos, as, the, current, mac, operating, system, that, officially, succeeded, the, classic, mac, os, in, 2001, the, system, was, originally, marketed, as, simply, version, 10, of, mac, os, but, it, has, a, history, that, is, largely, independent, of, the, classic, mac, os, it, is, a, unix, based, operating, system, built, on, nextstep, and, other, next, technology, from, the, late, 1980s, until, early, 1997, when, apple, purchased, the, company, and, its, ceo, steve, jobs, returned, to, apple, precursors, to, mac, os, x, include, openstep, apple, s, rhapsody, project, and, the, mac, os, x, public, beta, macos, is, based, on, apple, s, open, source, darwin, operating, system, which, is, based, on, the, xnu, kernel, and, bsd, macos, is, the, basis, for, some, of, apple, s, other, operating, systems, including, iphone, os, ios, ipados, watchos, tvos, and, visionos, the, first, version, of, the, system, was, released, on, march, 24, 2001, supporting, the, aqua, user, interface, since, then, several, more, versions, adding, newer, features, and, technologies, have, been, released, since, 2011, new, releases, have, been, offered, annually, macos, 10, 16, s, version, number, was, updated, to, 11, 0, in, the, third, beta, the, third, beta, version, of, macos, big, sur, is, 11, 0, beta, 3, instead, of, 10, 16, beta, 3, an, early, server, computing, version, of, the, system, was, released, in, 1999, as, a, technology, preview, it, was, followed, by, several, more, official, server, based, releases, server, functionality, has, instead, been, offered, as, an, add, on, for, the, desktop, system, since, 2011, the, apple, real, time, operating, system, environment, a, rose, is, a, small, embedded, operating, system, which, runs, on, the, macintosh, coprocessor, platform, an, expansion, card, for, the, macintosh, it, is, a, single, overdesigned, hardware, platform, on, which, third, party, vendors, build, practically, any, product, reducing, the, otherwise, heavy, workload, of, developing, a, nubus, based, expansion, card, the, first, version, of, the, system, was, ready, for, use, in, february, 1988, in, 1988, apple, released, its, first, unix, based, os, a, ux, which, is, a, unix, operating, system, with, the, mac, os, look, and, feel, it, was, not, very, competitive, for, its, time, due, in, part, to, the, crowded, unix, market, and, macintosh, hardware, lacking, high, end, design, features, present, on, workstation, class, computers, most, of, its, sales, was, to, the, u, s, government, where, macos, lacks, posix, compliance, the, macintosh, application, environment, mae, is, a, software, package, introduced, by, apple, in, 1994, that, allows, certain, unix, based, computer, workstations, to, run, macintosh, applications, mae, uses, the, x, window, system, to, emulate, a, macintosh, finder, style, graphical, user, interface, the, last, version, mae, 3, 0, is, compatible, with, system, 7, 5, 3, mae, was, published, for, sun, microsystems, sparcstation, and, hewlett, packard, systems, it, was, discontinued, on, may, 14, 1998, announced, at, the, 1996, worldwide, developers, conference, wwdc, mklinux, is, an, open, source, operating, system, that, was, started, by, the, osf, research, institute, and, apple, in, february, 1996, to, port, linux, to, the, powerpc, platform, and, thus, macintosh, computers, in, mid, 1998, the, community, led, mklinux, developers, association, took, over, development, of, the, operating, system, mklinux, is, short, for, microkernel, linux, which, refers, to, its, adaptation, of, the, monolithic, linux, kernel, to, run, as, a, server, hosted, atop, the, mach, microkernel, version, 3, 0, the, star, trek, project, as, in, to, boldly, go, where, no, mac, has, gone, before, was, a, secret, prototype, beginning, in, 1992, to, port, the, classic, mac, os, to, intel, compatible, x86, personal, computers, in, partnership, with, apple, and, with, support, from, intel, the, project, was, instigated, by, novell, which, was, looking, to, integrate, its, dr, dos, with, the, mac, os, gui, as, a, mutual, response, to, the, monopoly, of, microsoft, s, windows, 3, 0, and, ms, dos, a, team, consisting, of, four, from, apple, and, four, from, novell, was, got, the, macintosh, finder, and, some, basic, applications, such, as, quicktime, running, smoothly, the, project, was, canceled, one, year, later, in, early, 1993, but, was, partially, reused, when, porting, the, mac, os, to, powerpc, taligent, a, portmanteau, of, talent, and, intelligent, is, an, object, oriented, operating, system, and, the, company, producing, it, started, as, the, pink, project, within, apple, to, provide, a, replacement, for, the, classic, mac, os, it, was, later, spun, off, into, a, joint, venture, with, ibm, as, part, of, the, aim, alliance, with, the, purpose, of, building, a, competing, platform, to, microsoft, cairo, and, nextstep, the, development, process, never, worked, and, has, been, cited, as, an, example, of, a, project, death, march, apple, pulled, out, of, the, project, in, 1995, before, the, code, had, been, delivered, copland, was, a, project, at, apple, to, create, an, updated, version, of, the, classic, mac, os, it, was, to, have, introduced, protected, memory, preemptive, multitasking, and, new, underlying, operating, system, features, yet, still, be, compatible, with, existing, mac, software, they, originally, planned, the, follow, up, release, gershwin, to, add, multithreading, and, other, advanced, features, new, features, were, added, more, rapidly, than, they, could, be, completed, and, the, completion, date, slipped, into, the, future, with, no, sign, of, a, release, in, 1996, apple, canceled, the, project, outright, and, sought, a, suitable, third, party, replacement, copland, development, ended, in, august, 1996, and, in, december, 1996, apple, announced, that, it, was, buying, next, for, its, nextstep, operating, system
