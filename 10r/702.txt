air, traffic, control, atc, is, a, service, provided, by, ground, based, air, traffic, controllers, people, who, direct, aircraft, on, the, ground, and, through, a, given, section, of, controlled, airspace, and, can, provide, advisory, services, to, aircraft, in, non, controlled, airspace, the, primary, purpose, of, atc, worldwide, is, to, prevent, collisions, organise, and, expedite, the, flow, of, traffic, in, the, air, and, provide, information, and, other, support, for, pilots, personnel, of, air, traffic, control, monitor, aircraft, location, in, their, assigned, airspace, by, radar, and, communicate, with, the, pilots, by, radio, to, prevent, collisions, atc, enforces, traffic, separation, rules, which, ensure, each, aircraft, maintains, a, minimum, amount, of, empty, space, around, it, at, all, times, it, is, also, common, for, atc, to, provide, services, to, all, private, military, and, commercial, aircraft, operating, within, its, airspace, not, just, civilian, aircraft, depending, on, the, type, of, flight, and, the, class, of, airspace, atc, may, issue, instructions, that, pilots, are, required, to, obey, or, advisories, known, as, flight, information, in, some, countries, that, pilots, may, at, their, discretion, disregard, the, pilot, in, command, of, their, aircraft, always, retain, final, authority, for, its, safe, operation, and, may, in, an, emergency, deviate, from, atc, instructions, to, the, extent, required, to, maintain, safe, operation, of, their, aircraft, pursuant, to, requirements, of, the, international, civil, aviation, organization, icao, atc, operations, are, conducted, either, in, the, english, language, or, the, local, language, used, by, the, station, on, the, ground, in, practice, the, native, language, for, a, region, is, used, however, english, must, be, used, upon, request, in, 1920, croydon, airport, near, london, england, was, the, first, airport, in, the, world, to, introduce, air, traffic, control, the, aerodrome, control, tower, was, a, wooden, hut, 15, feet, 5, metres, high, with, windows, on, all, four, sides, it, was, commissioned, on, 25, february, 1920, and, provided, basic, traffic, weather, and, location, information, to, pilots, in, the, united, states, of, america, air, traffic, control, developed, three, divisions, the, first, of, several, air, mail, radio, stations, amrs, was, created, in, 1922, after, world, war, i, when, the, u, s, post, office, began, using, techniques, developed, by, the, u, s, army, to, direct, and, track, the, movements, of, reconnaissance, aircraft, over, time, the, amrs, morphed, into, flight, service, stations, today, s, flight, service, stations, do, not, issue, control, instructions, but, provide, pilots, with, many, other, flight, related, informational, services, they, do, relay, control, instructions, from, atc, in, areas, where, flight, service, is, the, only, facility, with, radio, or, phone, coverage, the, first, airport, traffic, control, tower, regulating, arrivals, departures, and, surface, movement, of, aircraft, in, the, usa, at, a, specific, airport, opened, in, cleveland, in, 1930, approach, departure, control, facilities, were, created, after, adoption, of, radar, in, the, 1950s, to, monitor, and, control, the, busy, airspace, around, larger, airports, the, first, air, route, traffic, control, center, artcc, which, directs, the, movement, of, aircraft, between, departure, and, destination, was, opened, in, newark, in, 1935, followed, in, 1936, by, chicago, and, cleveland, currently, in, the, u, s, the, federal, aviation, administration, faa, operates, 22, air, route, traffic, control, centers, after, the, 1956, grand, canyon, mid, air, collision, killing, all, 128, on, board, the, faa, was, given, the, air, traffic, responsibility, over, the, united, states, in, 1958, and, this, was, followed, by, other, countries, in, 1960, britain, france, germany, and, the, benelux, countries, set, up, eurocontrol, intending, to, merge, their, airspaces, the, first, and, only, attempt, to, pool, controllers, between, countries, is, the, maastricht, upper, area, control, centre, muac, founded, in, 1972, by, eurocontrol, and, covering, belgium, luxembourg, the, netherlands, and, north, western, germany, in, 2001, the, european, union, eu, aimed, to, create, a, single, european, sky, hoping, to, boost, efficiency, and, gain, economies, of, scale, the, primary, method, of, controlling, the, immediate, airport, environment, is, visual, observation, from, the, airport, control, tower, the, tower, is, typically, a, tall, windowed, structure, located, within, the, airport, grounds, the, air, traffic, controllers, usually, abbreviated, controller, are, responsible, for, separation, and, efficient, movement, of, aircraft, and, vehicles, operating, on, the, taxiways, and, runways, of, the, airport, itself, and, aircraft, in, the, air, near, the, airport, generally, 5, to, 10, nautical, miles, 9, to, 19, kilometres, 6, to, 12, miles, depending, on, the, airport, procedures, a, controller, must, carry, out, the, job, using, the, precise, and, effective, application, of, rules, and, procedures, however, they, need, flexible, adjustments, according, to, differing, circumstances, often, under, time, pressure, in, a, study, that, compared, stress, in, the, general, population, and, this, kind, of, system, markedly, showed, more, stress, level, for, controllers, this, variation, can, be, explained, at, least, in, part, by, the, characteristics, of, the, job, surveillance, displays, are, also, available, to, controllers, at, larger, airports, to, assist, with, controlling, air, traffic, controllers, may, use, a, radar, system, called, secondary, surveillance, radar, for, airborne, traffic, approaching, and, departing, these, displays, include, a, map, of, the, area, the, position, of, various, aircraft, and, data, tags, that, include, aircraft, identification, speed, altitude, and, other, information, described, in, local, procedures, in, adverse, weather, conditions, the, tower, controllers, may, also, use, surface, movement, radar, smr, surface, movement, guidance, and, control, system, smgcs, or, advanced, surface, movement, guidance, and, control, system, asmgcs, to, control, traffic, on, the, manoeuvring, area, taxiways, and, runways, the, areas, of, responsibility, for, tower, controllers, fall, into, three, general, operational, disciplines, local, control, or, air, control, ground, control, and, flight, data, clearance, delivery, other, categories, such, as, airport, apron, control, or, ground, movement, planner, may, also, exist, at, extremely, busy, airports, while, each, tower, may, have, unique, airport, specific, procedures, such, as, multiple, teams, of, controllers, crews, at, major, or, complex, airports, with, multiple, runways, the, following, provides, a, general, concept, of, the, delegation, of, responsibilities, within, the, air, traffic, control, tower, environment, remote, and, virtual, tower, rvt, is, a, system, based, on, air, traffic, controllers, being, located, somewhere, other, than, at, the, local, airport, tower, and, still, able, to, provide, air, traffic, control, services, displays, for, the, air, traffic, controllers, may, be, live, video, synthetic, images, based, on, surveillance, sensor, data, or, both, ground, control, sometimes, known, as, ground, movement, control, gmc, is, responsible, for, the, airport, movement, areas, as, well, as, areas, not, released, to, the, airlines, or, other, users, this, generally, includes, all, taxiways, inactive, runways, holding, areas, and, some, transitional, aprons, or, intersections, where, aircraft, arrive, having, vacated, the, runway, or, departure, gate, exact, areas, and, control, responsibilities, are, clearly, defined, in, local, documents, and, agreements, at, each, airport, any, aircraft, vehicle, or, person, walking, or, working, in, these, areas, is, required, to, have, clearance, from, ground, control, this, is, normally, done, via, vhf, uhf, radio, but, there, may, be, special, cases, where, other, procedures, are, used, aircraft, or, vehicles, without, radios, must, respond, to, atc, instructions, via, aviation, light, signals, or, else, be, led, by, official, airport, vehicles, with, radios, people, working, on, the, airport, surface, normally, have, a, communications, link, through, which, they, can, communicate, with, ground, control, commonly, either, by, handheld, radio, or, even, cell, phone, ground, control, is, vital, to, the, smooth, operation, of, the, airport, because, this, position, impacts, the, sequencing, of, departure, aircraft, affecting, the, safety, and, efficiency, of, the, airport, s, operation, some, busier, airports, have, surface, movement, radar, smr, such, as, asde, 3, amass, or, asde, x, designed, to, display, aircraft, and, vehicles, on, the, ground, these, are, used, by, ground, control, as, an, additional, tool, to, control, ground, traffic, particularly, at, night, or, in, poor, visibility, there, is, a, wide, range, of, capabilities, on, these, systems, as, they, are, being, modernised, older, systems, will, display, a, map, of, the, airport, and, the, target, newer, systems, include, the, capability, to, display, higher, quality, mapping, radar, targets, data, blocks, and, safety, alerts, and, to, interface, with, other, systems, such, as, digital, flight, strips, air, control, known, to, pilots, as, tower, or, tower, control, is, responsible, for, the, active, runway, surfaces, air, control, gives, clearance, for, aircraft, takeoff, or, landing, whilst, ensuring, that, prescribed, runway, separation, will, exist, at, all, times, if, the, air, controller, detects, any, unsafe, conditions, a, landing, aircraft, may, be, instructed, to, go, around, and, be, re, sequenced, into, the, landing, pattern, this, re, sequencing, will, depend, on, the, type, of, flight, and, may, be, handled, by, the, air, controller, approach, or, terminal, area, controller, within, the, tower, a, highly, disciplined, communications, process, between, the, air, control, and, ground, control, is, an, absolute, necessity, air, control, must, ensure, that, ground, control, is, aware, of, any, operations, that, will, impact, the, taxiways, and, work, with, the, approach, radar, controllers, to, create, gaps, in, the, arrival, traffic, to, allow, taxiing, traffic, to, cross, runways, and, to, allow, departing, aircraft, to, take, off, ground, control, needs, to, keep, the, air, controllers, aware, of, the, traffic, flow, towards, their, runways, to, maximise, runway, utilisation, through, effective, approach, spacing, crew, resource, management, crm, procedures, are, often, used, to, ensure, this, communication, process, is, efficient, and, clear, within, atc, it, is, usually, known, as, team, resource, management, trm, and, the, level, of, focus, on, trm, varies, within, different, atc, organisations, clearance, delivery, is, the, position, that, issues, route, clearances, to, aircraft, typically, before, they, commence, taxiing, these, clearances, contain, details, of, the, route, that, the, aircraft, is, expected, to, fly, after, departure, clearance, delivery, or, at, busy, airports, ground, movement, planner, gmp, or, traffic, management, coordinator, tmc, will, if, necessary, coordinate, with, the, relevant, radar, centre, or, flow, control, unit, to, obtain, releases, for, aircraft, at, busy, airports, these, releases, are, often, automatic, and, are, controlled, by, local, agreements, allowing, free, flow, departures, when, weather, or, extremely, high, demand, for, a, certain, airport, or, airspace, becomes, a, factor, there, may, be, ground, stops, or, slot, delays, or, re, routes, may, be, necessary, to, ensure, the, system, does, not, get, overloaded, the, primary, responsibility, of, clearance, delivery, is, to, ensure, that, the, aircraft, has, the, correct, aerodrome, information, such, as, weather, and, airport, conditions, the, correct, route, after, departure, and, time, restrictions, relating, to, that, flight, this, information, is, also, coordinated, with, the, relevant, radar, centre, or, flow, control, unit, and, ground, control, to, ensure, that, the, aircraft, reaches, the, runway, in, time, to, meet, the, time, restriction, provided, by, the, relevant, unit, at, some, airports, clearance, delivery, also, plans, aircraft, push, backs, and, engine, starts, in, which, case, it, is, known, as, the, ground, movement, planner, gmp, this, position, is, particularly, important, at, heavily, congested, airports, to, prevent, taxiway, and, aircraft, parking, area, gridlock, flight, data, which, is, routinely, combined, with, clearance, delivery, is, the, position, that, is, responsible, for, ensuring, that, both, controllers, and, pilots, have, the, most, current, information, pertinent, weather, changes, outages, airport, ground, delays, ground, stops, runway, closures, etc, flight, data, may, inform, the, pilots, using, a, recorded, continuous, loop, on, a, specific, frequency, known, as, the, automatic, terminal, information, service, atis, many, airports, have, a, radar, control, facility, that, is, associated, with, that, specific, airport, in, most, countries, this, is, referred, to, as, terminal, control, and, abbreviated, to, tmc, in, the, u, s, it, is, referred, to, as, a, terminal, radar, approach, control, or, tracon, while, every, airport, varies, terminal, controllers, usually, handle, traffic, in, a, 30, to, 50, nautical, mile, 56, to, 93, km, 35, to, 58, mi, radius, from, the, airport, where, there, are, many, busy, airports, close, together, one, consolidated, terminal, control, centre, may, service, all, the, airports, the, airspace, boundaries, and, altitudes, assigned, to, a, terminal, control, centre, which, vary, widely, from, airport, to, airport, are, based, on, factors, such, as, traffic, flows, neighbouring, airports, and, terrain, a, large, and, complex, example, was, the, london, terminal, control, centre, ltcc, which, controlled, traffic, for, five, main, london, airports, up, to, an, altitude, of, 20, 000, feet, 6, 096, metres, and, out, to, a, distance, of, 100, nautical, miles, 185, kilometres, 115, miles, terminal, controllers, are, responsible, for, providing, all, atc, services, within, their, airspace, traffic, flow, is, broadly, divided, into, departures, arrivals, and, overflights, as, aircraft, move, in, and, out, of, the, terminal, airspace, they, are, handed, off, to, the, next, appropriate, control, facility, a, control, tower, an, en, route, control, facility, or, a, bordering, terminal, or, approach, control, terminal, control, is, responsible, for, ensuring, that, aircraft, are, at, an, appropriate, altitude, when, they, are, handed, off, and, that, aircraft, arrive, at, a, suitable, rate, for, landing, not, all, airports, have, a, radar, approach, or, terminal, control, available, in, this, case, the, en, route, centre, or, a, neighbouring, terminal, or, approach, control, may, co, ordinate, directly, with, the, tower, on, the, airport, and, vector, inbound, aircraft, to, a, position, from, where, they, can, land, visually, at, some, of, these, airports, the, tower, may, provide, a, non, radar, procedural, approach, service, to, arriving, aircraft, handed, over, from, a, radar, unit, before, they, are, visual, to, land, some, units, also, have, a, dedicated, approach, unit, which, can, provide, the, procedural, approach, service, either, all, the, time, or, for, any, periods, of, radar, outage, for, any, reason, in, the, u, s, tracons, are, additionally, designated, by, a, three, digit, alphanumeric, code, for, example, the, chicago, tracon, is, designated, c90, air, traffic, control, also, provides, services, to, aircraft, in, flight, between, airports, pilots, fly, under, one, of, two, sets, of, rules, for, separation, visual, flight, rules, vfr, or, instrument, flight, rules, ifr, air, traffic, controllers, have, different, responsibilities, to, aircraft, operating, under, the, different, sets, of, rules, while, ifr, flights, are, under, positive, control, in, the, us, and, canada, vfr, pilots, can, request, flight, following, radar, advisories, which, provides, traffic, advisory, services, on, a, time, permitting, basis, and, may, also, provide, assistance, in, avoiding, areas, of, weather, and, flight, restrictions, as, well, as, allowing, pilots, into, the, air, traffic, control, system, prior, to, the, need, to, a, clearance, into, certain, airspace, throughout, europe, pilots, may, request, a, flight, information, service, which, is, similar, to, flight, following, in, the, united, kingdom, it, is, known, as, a, basic, service, en, route, air, traffic, controllers, issue, clearances, and, instructions, for, airborne, aircraft, and, pilots, are, required, to, comply, with, these, instructions, en, route, controllers, also, provide, air, traffic, control, services, to, many, smaller, airports, around, the, country, including, clearance, off, the, ground, and, clearance, for, approach, to, an, airport, controllers, adhere, to, a, set, of, separation, standards, that, define, the, minimum, distance, allowed, between, aircraft, these, distances, vary, depending, on, the, equipment, and, procedures, used, in, providing, atc, services, en, route, air, traffic, controllers, work, in, facilities, called, air, traffic, control, centres, each, of, which, is, commonly, referred, to, as, a, centre, the, united, states, uses, the, equivalent, term, air, route, traffic, control, center, each, centre, is, responsible, for, a, given, flight, information, region, fir, each, flight, information, region, typically, covers, many, thousands, of, square, miles, of, airspace, and, the, airports, within, that, airspace, centres, control, ifr, aircraft, from, the, time, they, depart, from, an, airport, or, terminal, area, s, airspace, to, the, time, they, arrive, at, another, airport, or, terminal, area, s, airspace, centres, may, also, pick, up, vfr, aircraft, that, are, already, airborne, and, integrate, them, into, their, system, these, aircraft, must, continue, under, vfr, flight, rules, until, the, centre, provides, a, clearance, centre, controllers, are, responsible, for, issuing, instructions, to, pilots, to, climb, their, aircraft, to, their, assigned, altitude, while, at, the, same, time, ensuring, that, the, aircraft, is, properly, separated, from, all, other, aircraft, in, its, immediate, area, additionally, the, aircraft, must, be, placed, in, a, flow, consistent, with, the, aircraft, s, route, of, flight, this, effort, is, complicated, by, crossing, traffic, severe, weather, special, missions, that, require, large, airspace, allocations, and, traffic, density, when, the, aircraft, approaches, its, destination, the, centre, is, responsible, for, issuing, instructions, to, pilots, so, that, they, will, meet, altitude, restrictions, by, specific, points, as, well, as, providing, many, destination, airports, with, a, traffic, flow, which, prohibits, all, of, the, arrivals, being, bunched, together, these, flow, restrictions, often, begin, in, the, middle, of, the, route, as, controllers, will, position, aircraft, landing, in, the, same, destination, so, that, when, the, aircraft, are, close, to, their, destination, they, are, sequenced, as, an, aircraft, reaches, the, boundary, of, a, centre, s, control, area, it, is, handed, off, or, handed, over, to, the, next, area, control, centre, in, some, cases, this, hand, off, process, involves, a, transfer, of, identification, and, details, between, controllers, so, that, air, traffic, control, services, can, be, provided, in, a, seamless, manner, in, other, cases, local, agreements, may, allow, silent, handovers, such, that, the, receiving, centre, does, not, require, any, co, ordination, if, traffic, is, presented, in, an, agreed, manner, after, the, hand, off, the, aircraft, is, given, a, frequency, change, and, its, pilot, begins, talking, to, the, next, controller, this, process, continues, until, the, aircraft, is, handed, off, to, a, terminal, controller, approach, since, centres, control, a, large, airspace, area, they, will, typically, use, long, range, radar, that, has, the, capability, at, higher, altitudes, to, see, aircraft, within, 200, nautical, miles, 370, kilometres, 230, miles, of, the, radar, antenna, they, may, also, use, radar, data, to, control, when, it, provides, a, better, picture, of, the, traffic, or, when, it, can, fill, in, a, portion, of, the, area, not, covered, by, the, long, range, radar, in, the, u, s, system, at, higher, altitudes, over, 90, of, the, u, s, airspace, is, covered, by, radar, and, often, by, multiple, radar, systems, however, coverage, may, be, inconsistent, at, lower, altitudes, used, by, aircraft, due, to, high, terrain, or, distance, from, radar, facilities, a, centre, may, require, numerous, radar, systems, to, cover, the, airspace, assigned, to, them, and, may, also, rely, on, pilot, position, reports, from, aircraft, flying, below, the, floor, of, radar, coverage, this, results, in, a, large, amount, of, data, being, available, to, the, controller, to, address, this, automation, systems, have, been, designed, that, consolidate, the, radar, data, for, the, controller, this, consolidation, includes, eliminating, duplicate, radar, returns, ensuring, the, best, radar, for, each, geographical, area, is, providing, the, data, and, displaying, the, data, in, an, effective, format, centres, also, exercise, control, over, traffic, travelling, over, the, world, s, ocean, areas, these, areas, are, also, flight, information, regions, firs, because, there, are, no, radar, systems, available, for, oceanic, control, oceanic, controllers, provide, atc, services, using, procedural, control, these, procedures, use, aircraft, position, reports, time, altitude, distance, and, speed, to, ensure, separation, controllers, record, information, on, flight, progress, strips, and, in, specially, developed, oceanic, computer, systems, as, aircraft, report, positions, this, process, requires, that, aircraft, be, separated, by, greater, distances, which, reduces, the, overall, capacity, for, any, given, route, the, north, atlantic, track, system, is, a, notable, example, of, this, method, some, air, navigation, service, providers, e, g, airservices, australia, the, u, s, federal, aviation, administration, nav, canada, etc, have, implemented, automatic, dependent, surveillance, broadcast, ads, b, as, part, of, their, surveillance, capability, this, newer, technology, reverses, the, radar, concept, instead, of, radar, finding, a, target, by, interrogating, the, transponder, the, ads, b, equipped, aircraft, broadcasts, a, position, report, as, determined, by, the, navigation, equipment, on, board, the, aircraft, ads, c, is, another, mode, of, automatic, dependent, surveillance, however, ads, c, operates, in, the, contract, mode, where, the, aircraft, reports, a, position, automatically, or, initiated, by, the, pilot, based, on, a, predetermined, time, interval, it, is, also, possible, for, controllers, to, request, more, frequent, reports, to, more, quickly, establish, aircraft, position, for, specific, reasons, however, since, the, cost, for, each, report, is, charged, by, the, ads, service, providers, to, the, company, operating, the, aircraft, more, frequent, reports, are, not, commonly, requested, except, in, emergency, situations, ads, c, is, significant, because, it, can, be, used, where, it, is, not, possible, to, locate, the, infrastructure, for, a, radar, system, e, g, over, water, computerised, radar, displays, are, now, being, designed, to, accept, ads, c, inputs, as, part, of, their, display, this, technology, is, currently, used, in, portions, of, the, north, atlantic, and, the, pacific, by, a, variety, of, states, who, share, responsibility, for, the, control, of, this, airspace, precision, approach, radars, par, are, commonly, used, by, military, controllers, of, air, forces, of, several, countries, to, assist, the, pilot, in, final, phases, of, landing, in, places, where, instrument, landing, system, and, other, sophisticated, airborne, equipment, are, unavailable, to, assist, the, pilots, in, marginal, or, near, zero, visibility, conditions, this, procedure, is, also, called, a, talk, down, a, radar, archive, system, ras, keeps, an, electronic, record, of, all, radar, information, preserving, it, for, a, few, weeks, this, information, can, be, useful, for, search, and, rescue, when, an, aircraft, has, disappeared, from, radar, screens, a, controller, can, review, the, last, radar, returns, from, the, aircraft, to, determine, its, likely, position, for, an, example, see, the, crash, report, in, the, following, citation, ras, is, also, useful, to, technicians, who, are, maintaining, radar, systems, the, mapping, of, flights, in, real, time, is, based, on, the, air, traffic, control, system, and, volunteer, ads, b, receivers, in, 1991, data, on, the, location, of, aircraft, was, made, available, by, the, federal, aviation, administration, to, the, airline, industry, the, national, business, aviation, association, nbaa, the, general, aviation, manufacturers, association, the, aircraft, owners, and, pilots, association, the, helicopter, association, international, and, the, national, air, transportation, association, petitioned, the, faa, to, make, asdi, information, available, on, a, need, to, know, basis, subsequently, nbaa, advocated, the, broad, scale, dissemination, of, air, traffic, data, the, aircraft, situational, display, to, industry, asdi, system, now, conveys, up, to, date, flight, information, to, the, airline, industry, and, the, public, some, companies, that, distribute, asdi, information, are, flightradar24, flightexplorer, flightview, and, flytecomm, each, company, maintains, a, website, that, provides, free, updated, information, to, the, public, on, flight, status, stand, alone, programmes, are, also, available, for, displaying, the, geographic, location, of, airborne, instrument, flight, rules, ifr, air, traffic, anywhere, in, the, faa, air, traffic, system, positions, are, reported, for, both, commercial, and, general, aviation, traffic, the, programmes, can, overlay, air, traffic, with, a, wide, selection, of, maps, such, as, geo, political, boundaries, air, traffic, control, centre, boundaries, high, altitude, jet, routes, satellite, cloud, and, radar, imagery, the, day, to, day, problems, faced, by, the, air, traffic, control, system, are, primarily, related, to, the, volume, of, air, traffic, demand, placed, on, the, system, and, weather, several, factors, dictate, the, amount, of, traffic, that, can, land, at, an, airport, in, a, given, amount, of, time, each, landing, aircraft, must, touch, down, slow, and, exit, the, runway, before, the, next, aircraft, crosses, the, approach, end, of, the, runway, this, process, requires, at, least, one, and, up, to, four, minutes, for, each, aircraft, allowing, for, departures, between, arrivals, each, runway, can, thus, handle, about, 30, aircraft, arrivals, per, hour, a, large, airport, with, two, arrival, runways, can, handle, about, 60, arrivals, per, hour, in, good, weather, problems, arise, when, airlines, schedule, more, arrivals, into, an, airport, than, can, be, physically, handled, or, when, delays, elsewhere, cause, groups, of, aircraft, that, would, otherwise, be, separated, in, time, to, arrive, simultaneously, aircraft, must, then, be, delayed, in, the, air, by, holding, over, specified, locations, until, they, may, be, safely, sequenced, to, the, runway, up, until, the, 1990s, holding, which, has, significant, environmental, and, cost, implications, was, a, routine, occurrence, at, many, airports, advances, in, computers, now, allow, the, sequencing, of, aircraft, hours, in, advance, thus, aircraft, may, be, delayed, before, they, even, take, off, by, being, given, a, slot, or, may, reduce, speed, in, flight, and, proceed, more, slowly, thus, significantly, reducing, the, amount, of, holding, air, traffic, control, errors, occur, when, the, separation, either, vertical, or, horizontal, between, airborne, aircraft, falls, below, the, minimum, prescribed, separation, set, for, the, domestic, united, states, by, the, us, federal, aviation, administration, separation, minimums, for, terminal, control, areas, tcas, around, airports, are, lower, than, en, route, standards, errors, generally, occur, during, periods, following, times, of, intense, activity, when, controllers, tend, to, relax, and, overlook, the, presence, of, traffic, and, conditions, that, lead, to, loss, of, minimum, separation, beyond, runway, capacity, issues, the, weather, is, a, major, factor, in, traffic, capacity, rain, ice, snow, or, hail, on, the, runway, cause, landing, aircraft, to, take, longer, to, slow, and, exit, thus, reducing, the, safe, arrival, rate, and, requiring, more, space, between, landing, aircraft, fog, also, requires, a, decrease, in, the, landing, rate, these, in, turn, increase, airborne, delay, for, holding, aircraft, if, more, aircraft, are, scheduled, than, can, be, safely, and, efficiently, held, in, the, air, a, ground, delay, programme, may, be, established, delaying, aircraft, on, the, ground, before, departure, due, to, conditions, at, the, arrival, airport, in, area, control, centres, a, major, weather, problem, is, thunderstorms, which, present, a, variety, of, hazards, to, aircraft, airborne, aircraft, will, deviate, around, storms, reducing, the, capacity, of, the, en, route, system, by, requiring, more, space, per, aircraft, or, causing, congestion, as, many, aircraft, try, to, move, through, a, single, hole, in, a, line, of, thunderstorms, occasionally, weather, considerations, cause, delays, to, aircraft, prior, to, their, departure, as, routes, are, closed, by, thunderstorms, much, money, has, been, spent, on, creating, software, to, streamline, this, process, however, at, some, accs, air, traffic, controllers, still, record, data, for, each, flight, on, strips, of, paper, and, personally, coordinate, their, paths, in, newer, sites, these, flight, progress, strips, have, been, replaced, by, electronic, data, presented, on, computer, screens, as, new, equipment, is, brought, in, more, and, more, sites, are, upgrading, away, from, paper, flight, strips, constrained, control, capacity, and, growing, traffic, lead, to, flight, cancellation, and, delays, by, then, the, market, for, air, traffic, services, was, worth, 14bn, more, efficient, atc, could, save, 5, 10, of, aviation, fuel, by, avoiding, holding, patterns, and, indirect, airways, the, military, takes, 80, of, chinese, airspace, congesting, the, thin, corridors, open, to, airliners, the, united, kingdom, closes, its, military, airspace, only, during, military, exercises, a, prerequisite, to, safe, air, traffic, separation, is, the, assignment, and, use, of, distinctive, call, signs, these, are, permanently, allocated, by, icao, on, request, usually, to, scheduled, flights, and, some, air, forces, and, other, military, services, for, military, flights, there, are, written, call, signs, with, a, two, or, three, letter, combination, followed, by, the, flight, number, such, as, aal872, or, vlg1011, as, such, they, appear, on, flight, plans, and, atc, radar, labels, there, are, also, the, audio, or, radio, telephony, call, signs, used, on, the, radio, contact, between, pilots, and, air, traffic, control, these, are, not, always, identical, to, their, written, counterparts, an, example, of, an, audio, call, sign, would, be, speedbird, 832, instead, of, the, written, baw832, this, is, used, to, reduce, the, chance, of, confusion, between, atc, and, the, aircraft, by, default, the, call, sign, for, any, other, flight, is, the, registration, number, or, tail, number, in, us, parlance, of, the, aircraft, such, as, n12345, c, gabc, or, ec, izd, the, short, radio, telephony, call, signs, for, these, tail, numbers, is, the, last, three, letters, using, the, nato, phonetic, alphabet, e, g, abc, spoken, alpha, bravo, charlie, for, c, gabc, or, the, last, three, numbers, e, g, three, four, five, for, n12345, in, the, united, states, the, prefix, may, be, an, aircraft, type, model, or, manufacturer, in, place, of, the, first, registration, character, for, example, n11842, could, become, cessna, 842, this, abbreviation, is, only, allowed, after, communications, have, been, established, in, each, sector, before, around, 1980, international, air, transport, association, iata, and, icao, were, using, the, same, two, letter, call, signs, due, to, the, larger, number, of, new, airlines, after, deregulation, the, icao, established, the, three, letter, call, signs, as, mentioned, above, the, iata, call, signs, are, currently, used, in, aerodromes, on, the, announcement, tables, but, are, no, longer, used, in, air, traffic, control, for, example, aa, is, the, iata, call, sign, for, american, airlines, the, atc, equivalent, is, aal, flight, numbers, in, regular, commercial, flights, are, designated, by, the, aircraft, operator, and, identical, call, sign, might, be, used, for, the, same, scheduled, journey, each, day, it, is, operated, even, if, the, departure, time, varies, a, little, across, different, days, of, the, week, the, call, sign, of, the, return, flight, often, differs, only, by, the, final, digit, from, the, outbound, flight, generally, airline, flight, numbers, are, even, if, east, bound, and, odd, if, west, bound, in, order, to, reduce, the, possibility, of, two, call, signs, on, one, frequency, at, any, time, sounding, too, similar, a, number, of, airlines, particularly, in, europe, have, started, using, alphanumeric, call, signs, that, are, not, based, on, flight, numbers, e, g, dlh23lg, spoken, as, lufthansa, two, three, lima, golf, to, prevent, confusion, between, incoming, dlh23, and, outgoing, dlh24, in, the, same, frequency, additionally, it, is, the, right, of, the, air, traffic, controller, to, change, the, audio, call, sign, for, the, period, the, flight, is, in, his, sector, if, there, is, a, risk, of, confusion, usually, choosing, the, aircraft, registration, identifier, instead, many, technologies, are, used, in, air, traffic, control, systems, primary, and, secondary, radar, are, used, to, enhance, a, controller, s, situation, awareness, within, their, assigned, airspace, all, types, of, aircraft, send, back, primary, echoes, of, varying, sizes, to, controllers, screens, as, radar, energy, is, bounced, off, their, skins, and, transponder, equipped, aircraft, reply, to, secondary, radar, interrogations, by, giving, an, id, mode, a, an, altitude, mode, c, and, or, a, unique, callsign, mode, s, certain, types, of, weather, may, also, register, on, the, radar, screen, these, inputs, added, to, data, from, other, radars, are, correlated, to, build, the, air, situation, some, basic, processing, occurs, on, the, radar, tracks, such, as, calculating, ground, speed, and, magnetic, headings, usually, a, flight, data, processing, system, manages, all, the, flight, plan, related, data, incorporating, in, a, low, or, high, degree, the, information, of, the, track, once, the, correlation, between, them, flight, plan, and, track, is, established, all, this, information, is, distributed, to, modern, operational, display, systems, making, it, available, to, controllers, the, federal, aviation, administration, faa, has, spent, over, us, 3, billion, on, software, but, a, fully, automated, system, is, still, yet, to, be, achieved, in, 2002, the, united, kingdom, commissioned, a, new, area, control, centre, into, service, at, the, london, area, control, centre, lacc, at, swanwick, in, hampshire, relieving, a, busy, suburban, centre, at, west, drayton, in, middlesex, north, of, london, heathrow, airport, software, from, lockheed, martin, predominates, at, the, london, area, control, centre, however, the, centre, was, initially, troubled, by, software, and, communications, problems, causing, delays, and, occasional, shutdowns, some, tools, are, available, in, different, domains, to, help, the, controller, further, in, the, united, states, some, alterations, to, traffic, control, procedures, are, being, examined, in, europe, the, single, european, sky, atm, research, sesar, programme, plans, to, develop, new, methods, technologies, procedures, and, systems, to, accommodate, future, 2020, and, beyond, air, traffic, needs, in, october, 2018, european, controller, unions, dismissed, setting, targets, to, improve, atc, as, a, waste, of, time, and, effort, as, new, technology, could, cut, costs, for, users, but, threaten, their, jobs, in, april, 2019, the, eu, called, for, a, digital, european, sky, focusing, on, cutting, costs, by, including, a, common, digitisation, standard, and, allowing, controllers, to, move, to, where, they, are, needed, instead, of, merging, national, atcs, as, it, would, not, solve, all, problems, single, air, traffic, control, services, in, continent, sized, america, and, china, does, not, alleviate, congestion, eurocontrol, tries, to, reduce, delays, by, diverting, flights, to, less, busy, routes, flight, paths, across, europe, were, redesigned, to, accommodate, the, new, airport, in, istanbul, which, opened, in, april, but, the, extra, capacity, will, be, absorbed, by, rising, demand, for, air, travel, well, paid, jobs, in, western, europe, could, move, east, with, cheaper, labour, the, average, spanish, controller, earn, over, 200, 000, a, year, over, seven, times, the, country, average, salary, more, than, pilots, and, at, least, ten, controllers, were, paid, over, 810, 000, 1, 1m, a, year, in, 2010, french, controllers, spent, a, cumulative, nine, months, on, strike, between, 2004, and, 2016, many, countries, have, also, privatised, or, corporatised, their, air, navigation, service, providers, there, are, several, models, that, can, be, used, for, atc, service, providers, the, first, is, to, have, the, atc, services, be, part, of, a, government, agency, as, is, currently, the, case, in, the, united, states, the, problem, with, this, model, is, that, funding, can, be, inconsistent, and, can, disrupt, the, development, and, operation, of, services, sometimes, funding, can, disappear, when, lawmakers, cannot, approve, budgets, in, time, both, proponents, and, opponents, of, privatisation, recognise, that, stable, funding, is, one, of, the, major, factors, for, successful, upgrades, of, atc, infrastructure, some, of, the, funding, issues, include, sequestration, and, politicisation, of, projects, proponents, argue, that, moving, atc, services, to, a, private, corporation, could, stabilise, funding, over, the, long, term, which, will, result, in, more, predictable, planning, and, rollout, of, new, technology, as, well, as, training, of, personnel, another, model, is, to, have, atc, services, provided, by, a, government, corporation, this, model, is, used, in, germany, where, funding, is, obtained, through, user, fees, yet, another, model, is, to, have, a, for, profit, corporation, operate, atc, services, this, is, the, model, used, in, the, united, kingdom, but, there, have, been, several, issues, with, the, system, there, including, a, large, scale, failure, in, december, 2014, which, caused, delays, and, cancellations, and, has, been, attributed, to, cost, cutting, measures, put, in, place, by, this, corporation, in, fact, earlier, that, year, the, corporation, owned, by, the, german, government, won, the, bid, to, provide, atc, services, for, gatwick, airport, in, the, united, kingdom, the, last, model, which, is, often, the, suggested, model, for, the, united, states, to, transition, to, is, to, have, a, non, profit, organisation, that, would, handle, atc, services, as, is, used, in, canada, the, canadian, system, is, the, one, most, often, used, as, a, model, by, proponents, of, privatisation, air, traffic, control, privatisation, has, been, successful, in, canada, with, the, creation, of, nav, canada, a, private, non, profit, organisation, which, has, reduced, costs, and, has, allowed, new, technologies, to, be, deployed, faster, due, to, the, elimination, of, much, of, the, bureaucratic, red, tape, this, has, resulted, in, shorter, flights, and, less, fuel, usage, it, has, also, resulted, in, flights, being, safer, due, to, new, technology, nav, canada, is, funded, from, fees, that, are, collected, from, the, airlines, based, on, the, weight, of, the, aircraft, and, the, distance, flown, air, traffic, control, is, operated, by, national, governments, with, few, exceptions, in, the, european, union, only, italy, has, private, shareholders, privatisation, does, not, guarantee, lower, prices, the, profit, margin, of, muac, was, 70, in, 2017, as, there, is, no, competition, but, governments, could, offer, fixed, terms, concessions, australia, fiji, and, new, zealand, run, the, upper, airspace, for, the, pacific, islands, governments, hungarocontrol, offers, remote, airport, tower, services, from, budapest, and, since, 2014, provides, upper, airspace, management, for, kosovo, the, united, states, airspace, is, divided, into, 21, zones, centres, and, each, zone, is, divided, into, sectors, also, within, each, zone, are, portions, of, airspace, about, 50, miles, 80, kilometres, in, diameter, called, tracon, terminal, radar, approach, control, airspaces, within, each, tracon, airspace, are, a, number, of, airports, each, of, which, has, its, own, airspace, with, a, 5, miles, 8, 0, kilometres, radius, faa, control, tower, operators, cto, air, traffic, controllers, use, faa, order, 7110, 65, as, the, authority, for, all, procedures,
