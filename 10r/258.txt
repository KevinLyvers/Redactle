extrusion, is, a, process, used, to, create, objects, of, a, fixed, cross, sectional, profile, by, pushing, material, through, a, die, of, the, desired, cross, section, its, two, main, advantages, over, other, manufacturing, processes, are, its, ability, to, create, very, complex, cross, sections, and, to, work, materials, that, are, brittle, because, the, material, encounters, only, compressive, and, shear, stresses, it, also, creates, excellent, surface, finish, and, gives, considerable, freedom, of, form, in, the, design, process, drawing, is, a, similar, process, using, the, tensile, strength, of, the, material, to, pull, it, through, the, die, it, limits, the, amount, of, change, that, can, be, performed, in, one, step, so, it, is, limited, to, simpler, shapes, and, multiple, stages, are, usually, needed, drawing, is, the, main, way, to, produce, wire, metal, bars, and, tubes, are, also, often, drawn, extrusion, may, be, continuous, theoretically, producing, indefinitely, long, material, or, semi, continuous, producing, many, pieces, it, can, be, done, with, hot, or, cold, material, commonly, extruded, materials, include, metals, polymers, ceramics, concrete, modelling, clay, and, foodstuffs, products, of, extrusion, are, generally, called, extrudates, also, referred, to, as, hole, flanging, hollow, cavities, within, extruded, material, cannot, be, produced, using, a, simple, flat, extrusion, die, because, there, would, be, no, way, to, support, the, centre, barrier, of, the, die, instead, the, die, assumes, the, shape, of, a, block, with, depth, beginning, first, with, a, shape, profile, that, supports, the, center, section, the, die, shape, then, internally, changes, along, its, length, into, the, final, shape, with, the, suspended, center, pieces, supported, from, the, back, of, the, die, the, material, flows, around, the, supports, and, fuses, to, create, the, desired, closed, shape, the, extrusion, of, metals, can, also, increase, their, strength, in, 1797, joseph, bramah, patented, the, first, extrusion, process, for, making, pipe, out, of, soft, metals, it, involved, preheating, the, metal, and, then, forcing, it, through, a, die, via, a, hand, driven, plunger, in, 1820, thomas, burr, implemented, that, process, for, lead, pipe, with, a, hydraulic, press, also, invented, by, joseph, bramah, at, that, time, the, process, was, called, squirting, in, 1894, alexander, dick, expanded, the, extrusion, process, to, copper, and, brass, alloys, the, process, begins, by, heating, the, stock, material, for, hot, or, warm, extrusion, it, is, then, loaded, into, the, container, in, the, press, a, dummy, block, is, placed, behind, it, where, the, ram, then, presses, on, the, material, to, push, it, out, of, the, die, afterward, the, extrusion, is, stretched, in, order, to, straighten, it, if, better, properties, are, required, then, it, may, be, heat, treated, or, cold, worked, the, extrusion, ratio, is, defined, as, the, starting, cross, sectional, area, divided, by, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, final, extrusion, one, of, the, main, advantages, of, the, extrusion, process, is, that, this, ratio, can, be, very, large, while, still, producing, quality, parts, hot, extrusion, is, a, hot, working, process, which, means, it, is, done, above, the, material, s, recrystallization, temperature, to, keep, the, material, from, work, hardening, and, to, make, it, easier, to, push, the, material, through, the, die, most, hot, extrusions, are, done, on, horizontal, hydraulic, presses, that, range, from, 230, to, 11, 000, metric, tons, 250, to, 12, 130, short, tons, pressures, range, from, 30, to, 700, mpa, 4, 400, to, 101, 500, psi, therefore, lubrication, is, required, which, can, be, oil, or, graphite, for, lower, temperature, extrusions, or, glass, powder, for, higher, temperature, extrusions, the, biggest, disadvantage, of, this, process, is, its, cost, for, machinery, and, its, upkeep, the, extrusion, process, is, generally, economical, when, producing, between, several, kilograms, pounds, and, many, tons, depending, on, the, material, being, extruded, there, is, a, crossover, point, where, roll, forming, becomes, more, economical, for, instance, some, steels, become, more, economical, to, roll, if, producing, more, than, 20, 000, kg, 50, 000, lb, cold, extrusion, is, done, at, room, temperature, or, near, room, temperature, the, advantages, of, this, over, hot, extrusion, are, the, lack, of, oxidation, higher, strength, due, to, cold, working, closer, tolerances, better, surface, finish, and, fast, extrusion, speeds, if, the, material, is, subject, to, hot, shortness, materials, that, are, commonly, cold, extruded, include, lead, tin, aluminium, copper, zirconium, titanium, molybdenum, beryllium, vanadium, niobium, and, steel, examples, of, products, produced, by, this, process, are, collapsible, tubes, fire, extinguisher, cases, shock, absorber, cylinders, and, gear, blanks, in, march, 1956, a, us, patent, was, filed, for, process, for, warm, extrusion, of, metal, patent, us3156043, a, outlines, that, a, number, of, important, advantages, can, be, achieved, with, warm, extrusion, of, both, ferrous, and, non, ferrous, metals, and, alloys, if, a, billet, to, be, extruded, is, changed, in, its, physical, properties, in, response, to, physical, forces, by, being, heated, to, a, temperature, below, the, critical, melting, point, warm, extrusion, is, done, above, room, temperature, but, below, the, recrystallization, temperature, of, the, material, the, temperatures, ranges, from, 800, to, 1, 800, f, 424, to, 975, c, it, is, usually, used, to, achieve, the, proper, balance, of, required, forces, ductility, and, final, extrusion, properties, friction, extrusion, was, invented, at, the, welding, institute, in, the, uk, and, patented, in, 1991, it, was, originally, intended, primarily, as, a, method, for, production, of, homogeneous, microstructures, and, particle, distributions, in, metal, matrix, composite, materials, friction, extrusion, differs, from, conventional, extrusion, in, that, the, charge, billet, or, other, precursor, rotates, relative, to, the, extrusion, die, an, extrusion, force, is, applied, so, as, to, push, the, charge, against, the, die, in, practice, either, the, die, or, the, charge, may, rotate, or, they, may, be, counter, rotating, the, relative, rotary, motion, between, the, charge, and, the, die, has, several, significant, effects, on, the, process, first, the, relative, motion, in, the, plane, of, rotation, leads, to, large, shear, stresses, hence, plastic, deformation, in, the, layer, of, charge, in, contact, with, and, near, the, die, this, plastic, deformation, is, dissipated, by, recovery, and, recrystallization, processes, leading, to, substantial, heating, of, the, deforming, charge, because, of, the, deformation, heating, friction, extrusion, does, not, generally, require, preheating, of, the, charge, by, auxiliary, means, potentially, resulting, in, a, more, energy, efficient, process, second, the, substantial, level, of, plastic, deformation, in, the, region, of, relative, rotary, motion, can, promote, solid, state, welding, of, powders, or, other, finely, divided, precursors, such, as, flakes, and, chips, effectively, consolidating, the, charge, friction, consolidation, prior, to, extrusion, microextrusion, is, a, microforming, extrusion, process, performed, at, the, submillimetre, range, like, extrusion, metal, is, pushed, through, a, die, orifice, but, the, resulting, product, s, cross, section, can, fit, through, a, 1, mm, square, several, microextrusion, processes, have, been, developed, since, microforming, was, envisioned, in, 1990, forward, ram, and, billet, move, in, the, same, direction, and, backward, ram, and, billet, move, in, the, opposite, direction, microextrusion, were, first, introduced, with, forward, rod, backward, cup, and, double, cup, extrusion, methods, developing, later, regardless, of, method, one, of, the, greatest, challenges, of, creating, a, successful, microextrusion, machine, is, the, manufacture, of, the, die, and, ram, the, small, size, of, the, die, and, ram, along, with, the, stringent, accuracy, requirement, needs, suitable, manufacturing, processes, additionally, as, fu, and, chan, pointed, out, in, a, 2013, state, of, the, art, technology, review, several, issues, must, still, be, resolved, before, microextrusion, and, other, microforming, technologies, can, be, implemented, more, widely, including, deformation, load, and, defects, forming, system, stability, mechanical, properties, and, other, size, related, effects, on, the, crystallite, grain, structure, and, boundaries, there, are, many, different, variations, of, extrusion, equipment, they, vary, by, four, major, characteristics, a, single, or, twin, screw, auger, powered, by, an, electric, motor, or, a, ram, driven, by, hydraulic, pressure, often, used, for, steel, and, titanium, alloys, oil, pressure, for, aluminium, or, in, other, specialized, processes, such, as, rollers, inside, a, perforated, drum, for, the, production, of, many, simultaneous, streams, of, material, there, are, several, methods, for, forming, internal, cavities, in, extrusions, one, way, is, to, use, a, hollow, billet, and, then, use, a, fixed, or, floating, mandrel, a, fixed, mandrel, also, known, as, a, german, type, means, it, is, integrated, into, the, dummy, block, and, stem, a, floating, mandrel, also, known, as, a, french, type, floats, in, slots, in, the, dummy, block, and, aligns, itself, in, the, die, when, extruding, if, a, solid, billet, is, used, as, the, feed, material, then, it, must, first, be, pierced, by, the, mandrel, before, extruding, through, the, die, a, special, press, is, used, in, order, to, control, the, mandrel, independently, from, the, ram, the, solid, billet, could, also, be, used, with, a, spider, die, porthole, die, or, bridge, die, all, of, these, types, of, dies, incorporate, the, mandrel, in, the, die, and, have, legs, that, hold, the, mandrel, in, place, during, extrusion, the, metal, divides, flows, around, the, legs, then, merges, leaving, weld, lines, in, the, final, product, direct, extrusion, also, known, as, forward, extrusion, is, the, most, common, extrusion, process, it, works, by, placing, the, billet, in, a, heavy, walled, container, the, billet, is, pushed, through, the, die, by, a, ram, or, screw, there, is, a, reusable, dummy, block, between, the, ram, and, the, billet, to, keep, them, separated, the, major, disadvantage, of, this, process, is, that, the, force, required, to, extrude, the, billet, is, greater, than, that, needed, in, the, indirect, extrusion, process, because, of, the, frictional, forces, introduced, by, the, need, for, the, billet, to, travel, the, entire, length, of, the, container, because, of, this, the, greatest, force, required, is, at, the, beginning, of, process, and, slowly, decreases, as, the, billet, is, used, up, at, the, end, of, the, billet, the, force, greatly, increases, because, the, billet, is, thin, and, the, material, must, flow, radially, to, exit, the, die, the, end, of, the, billet, called, the, butt, end, is, not, used, for, this, reason, in, indirect, extrusion, also, known, as, backwards, extrusion, the, billet, and, container, move, together, while, the, die, is, stationary, the, die, is, held, in, place, by, a, stem, which, has, to, be, longer, than, the, container, length, the, maximum, length, of, the, extrusion, is, ultimately, dictated, by, the, column, strength, of, the, stem, because, the, billet, moves, with, the, container, the, frictional, forces, are, eliminated, this, leads, to, the, following, advantages, the, disadvantages, are, in, the, hydrostatic, extrusion, process, the, billet, is, completely, surrounded, by, a, pressurized, liquid, except, where, the, billet, contacts, the, die, this, process, can, be, done, hot, warm, or, cold, however, the, temperature, is, limited, by, the, stability, of, the, fluid, used, the, process, must, be, carried, out, in, a, sealed, cylinder, to, contain, the, hydrostatic, medium, the, fluid, can, be, pressurized, two, ways, the, advantages, of, this, process, include, the, disadvantages, are, most, modern, direct, or, indirect, extrusion, presses, are, hydraulically, driven, but, there, are, some, small, mechanical, presses, still, used, of, the, hydraulic, presses, there, are, two, types, direct, drive, oil, presses, and, accumulator, water, drives, direct, drive, oil, presses, are, the, most, common, because, they, are, reliable, and, robust, they, can, deliver, over, 35, mpa, 5, 000, psi, they, supply, a, constant, pressure, throughout, the, whole, billet, the, disadvantage, is, that, they, are, slow, between, 50, and, 200, mm, s, 2, 8, ips, accumulator, water, drives, are, more, expensive, and, larger, than, direct, drive, oil, presses, and, they, lose, about, 10, of, their, pressure, over, the, stroke, but, they, are, much, faster, up, to, 380, mm, s, 15, ips, because, of, this, they, are, used, when, extruding, steel, they, are, also, used, on, materials, that, must, be, heated, to, very, hot, temperatures, for, safety, reasons, hydrostatic, extrusion, presses, usually, use, castor, oil, at, pressure, up, to, 1, 400, mpa, 200, ksi, castor, oil, is, used, because, it, has, good, lubricity, and, high, pressure, properties, the, design, of, an, extrusion, profile, has, a, large, impact, on, how, readily, it, can, be, extruded, the, maximum, size, for, an, extrusion, is, determined, by, finding, the, smallest, circle, that, will, fit, around, the, cross, section, this, is, called, the, circumscribing, circle, this, diameter, in, turn, controls, the, size, of, the, die, required, which, ultimately, determines, if, the, part, will, fit, in, a, given, press, for, example, a, larger, press, can, handle, 60, cm, 24, in, diameter, circumscribing, circles, for, aluminium, and, 55, cm, 22, in, diameter, circles, for, steel, and, titanium, the, complexity, of, an, extruded, profile, can, be, roughly, quantified, by, calculating, the, shape, factor, which, is, the, amount, of, surface, area, generated, per, unit, mass, of, extrusion, this, affects, the, cost, of, tooling, as, well, as, the, rate, of, production, thicker, sections, generally, need, an, increased, section, size, in, order, for, the, material, to, flow, properly, legs, should, not, be, more, than, ten, times, longer, than, their, thickness, if, the, cross, section, is, asymmetrical, adjacent, sections, should, be, as, close, to, the, same, size, as, possible, sharp, corners, should, be, avoided, for, aluminium, and, magnesium, the, minimum, radius, should, be, 0, 4, mm, 1, 64, in, and, for, steel, corners, should, be, 0, 75, mm, 0, 030, in, and, fillets, should, be, 3, mm, 0, 12, in, the, following, table, lists, the, minimum, cross, section, and, thickness, for, various, materials, metals, that, are, commonly, extruded, include, magnesium, and, aluminium, alloys, usually, have, a, 0, 75, m, 30, in, rms, or, better, surface, finish, titanium, and, steel, can, achieve, a, 3, micrometres, 120, in, rms, in, 1950, ugine, s, journet, of, france, invented, a, process, which, uses, glass, as, a, lubricant, for, extruding, steel, the, ugine, sejournet, or, sejournet, process, is, now, used, for, other, materials, that, have, melting, temperatures, higher, than, steel, or, that, require, a, narrow, range, of, temperatures, to, extrude, such, as, the, platinum, iridium, alloy, used, to, make, kilogram, mass, standards, the, process, starts, by, heating, the, materials, to, the, extruding, temperature, and, then, rolling, it, in, glass, powder, the, glass, melts, and, forms, a, thin, film, 20, to, 30, mils, 0, 5, to, 0, 75, mm, in, order, to, separate, it, from, chamber, walls, and, allow, it, to, act, as, a, lubricant, a, thick, solid, glass, ring, that, is, 0, 25, to, 0, 75, in, 6, to, 18, mm, thick, is, placed, in, the, chamber, on, the, die, to, lubricate, the, extrusion, as, it, is, forced, through, the, die, a, second, advantage, of, this, glass, ring, is, its, ability, to, insulate, the, heat, of, the, billet, from, the, die, the, extrusion, will, have, a, 1, mil, thick, layer, of, glass, which, can, be, easily, removed, once, it, cools, another, breakthrough, in, lubrication, is, the, use, of, phosphate, coatings, with, this, process, in, conjunction, with, glass, lubrication, steel, can, be, cold, extruded, the, phosphate, coat, absorbs, the, liquid, glass, to, offer, even, better, lubricating, properties, plastics, extrusion, commonly, uses, plastic, chips, or, pellets, which, are, usually, dried, to, drive, out, moisture, in, a, hopper, before, going, to, the, feed, screw, the, polymer, resin, is, heated, to, molten, state, by, a, combination, of, heating, elements, and, shear, heating, from, the, extrusion, screw, the, screw, or, screws, as, the, case, with, twin, screw, extrusion, forces, the, resin, through, a, die, forming, the, resin, into, the, desired, shape, the, extrudate, is, cooled, and, solidified, as, it, is, pulled, through, the, die, or, water, tank, a, caterpillar, haul, off, called, a, puller, in, the, us, is, used, to, provide, tension, on, the, extrusion, line, which, is, essential, for, overall, quality, of, the, extrudate, pelletizers, can, also, create, this, tension, while, pulling, extruded, strands, in, to, be, cut, the, caterpillar, haul, off, must, provide, a, consistent, pull, otherwise, variation, in, cut, lengths, or, distorted, product, will, result, in, some, cases, such, as, fibre, reinforced, tubes, the, extrudate, is, pulled, through, a, very, long, die, in, a, process, called, pultrusion, the, configuration, of, the, interior, screws, are, a, driving, force, dependent, on, the, application, mixing, elements, or, convey, elements, are, used, in, various, formations, extrusion, is, common, in, the, application, of, adding, colorant, to, molten, plastic, thus, creating, specific, custom, color, extrusion, is, also, a, process, used, in, fused, filament, deposition, 3d, printers, whereby, the, extruder, is, often, composed, of, a, geared, motor, pushing, plastic, filament, through, a, nozzle, rubber, extrusion, is, a, method, used, to, make, rubber, items, in, this, process, either, synthetic, or, natural, rubber, that, hasn, t, been, hardened, yet, is, put, through, a, machine, called, an, extruder, this, machine, has, a, desired, shaped, mold, and, a, pressurized, conveyor, system, the, rubber, gets, heated, and, softened, in, the, extruder, making, it, bendable, it, then, gets, pushed, through, the, mold, which, gives, it, its, final, shape, the, extruder, consists, of, two, main, parts, a, screw, that, moves, the, rubber, along, the, conveyor, while, adding, other, materials, and, a, mold, where, the, soft, rubber, is, squeezed, into, after, the, rubber, gets, its, shape, from, the, mold, it, is, then, vulcanized, to, harden, it, into, a, usable, product, this, method, is, effective, for, large, rubber, pieces, that, are, long, and, have, a, consistent, shape, and, the, dies, used, in, this, process, are, inexpensive, it, is, often, used, to, make, things, like, rubber, seals, or, hoses, polymers, are, used, in, the, production, of, plastic, tubing, pipes, rods, rails, seals, and, sheets, or, films, ceramic, can, also, be, formed, into, shapes, via, extrusion, terracotta, extrusion, is, used, to, produce, pipes, many, modern, bricks, are, also, manufactured, using, a, brick, extrusion, process, with, the, advent, of, industrial, manufacturing, extrusion, found, application, in, food, processing, of, instant, foods, and, snacks, along, with, its, already, known, uses, in, plastics, and, metal, fabrication, the, main, role, of, extrusion, was, originally, developed, for, conveying, and, shaping, fluid, forms, of, processed, raw, materials, present, day, extrusion, cooking, technologies, and, capabilities, have, developed, into, sophisticated, processing, functions, including, mixing, conveying, shearing, separation, heating, cooling, shaping, co, extrusion, venting, volatiles, and, moisture, encapsulation, flavor, generation, and, sterilization, products, such, as, certain, pastas, many, breakfast, cereals, premade, cookie, dough, some, french, fries, certain, baby, foods, dry, or, semi, moist, pet, food, and, ready, to, eat, snacks, are, mostly, manufactured, by, extrusion, it, is, also, used, to, produce, modified, starch, and, to, pelletize, animal, feed, generally, high, temperature, extrusion, is, used, for, the, manufacture, of, ready, to, eat, snacks, while, cold, extrusion, is, used, for, the, manufacture, of, pasta, and, related, products, intended, for, later, cooking, and, consumption, the, processed, products, have, low, moisture, and, hence, considerably, higher, shelf, life, and, provide, variety, and, convenience, to, consumers, in, the, extrusion, process, raw, materials, are, first, ground, to, the, correct, particle, size, the, dry, mix, is, passed, through, a, pre, conditioner, in, which, other, ingredients, may, be, added, and, steam, is, injected, to, start, the, cooking, process, the, preconditioned, mix, is, then, passed, through, an, extruder, where, it, is, forced, through, a, die, and, cut, to, the, desired, length, the, cooking, process, takes, place, within, the, extruder, where, the, product, produces, its, own, friction, and, heat, due, to, the, pressure, generated, 10, 20, bar, the, main, independent, parameters, during, extrusion, cooking, are, feed, rate, particle, size, of, the, raw, material, barrel, temperature, screw, speed, and, moisture, content, the, extruding, process, can, induce, both, protein, denaturation, and, starch, gelatinization, depending, on, inputs, and, parameters, sometimes, a, catalyst, is, used, for, example, when, producing, texturised, vegetable, proteins, tvp, for, use, in, pharmaceutical, products, extrusion, through, nano, porous, polymeric, filters, is, being, used, to, produce, suspensions, of, lipid, vesicles, liposomes, or, transfersomes, with, a, particular, size, of, a, narrow, size, distribution, the, anti, cancer, drug, doxorubicin, in, liposome, delivery, system, is, formulated, by, extrusion, for, example, hot, melt, extrusion, is, also, utilized, in, pharmaceutical, solid, oral, dose, processing, to, enable, delivery, of, drugs, with, poor, solubility, and, bioavailability, hot, melt, extrusion, has, been, shown, to, molecularly, disperse, poorly, soluble, drugs, in, a, polymer, carrier, increasing, dissolution, rates, and, bioavailability, the, process, involves, the, application, of, heat, pressure, and, agitation, to, mix, materials, together, and, extrude, them, through, a, die, twin, screw, high, shear, extruders, blend, materials, and, simultaneously, break, up, particles, the, resulting, particle, can, be, blended, with, compression, aids, and, compressed, into, tablets, or, filled, into, unit, dose, capsules, the, extrusion, production, technology, of, fuel, briquettes, is, the, process, of, extrusion, screw, wastes, straw, sunflower, husks, buckwheat, etc, or, finely, shredded, wood, waste, sawdust, under, high, pressure, when, heated, from, 160, to, 350, c, the, resulting, fuel, briquettes, do, not, include, any, of, the, binders, but, one, natural, the, lignin, contained, in, the, cells, of, plant, wastes, the, temperature, during, compression, causes, melting, of, the, surface, of, bricks, making, it, more, solid, which, is, important, for, the, transportation, of, briquettes, the, majority, of, synthetic, materials, in, textiles, are, manufactured, with, extrusion, only, fiber, forming, substances, are, used, in, extrusion, to, form, various, synthetic, filaments, the, molten, materials, are, passed, through, a, spinneret, that, helps, in, forming, fibers
