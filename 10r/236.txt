a, ceramic, is, any, of, the, various, hard, brittle, heat, resistant, and, corrosion, resistant, materials, made, by, shaping, and, then, firing, an, inorganic, nonmetallic, material, such, as, clay, at, a, high, temperature, common, examples, are, earthenware, porcelain, and, brick, the, earliest, ceramics, made, by, humans, were, fired, clay, bricks, used, for, building, house, walls, and, other, structures, other, pottery, objects, such, as, pots, vessels, vases, and, figurines, were, made, from, clay, either, by, itself, or, mixed, with, other, materials, like, silica, hardened, by, sintering, in, fire, later, ceramics, were, glazed, and, fired, to, create, smooth, colored, surfaces, decreasing, porosity, through, the, use, of, glassy, amorphous, ceramic, coatings, on, top, of, the, crystalline, ceramic, substrates, ceramics, now, include, domestic, industrial, and, building, products, as, well, as, a, wide, range, of, materials, developed, for, use, in, advanced, ceramic, engineering, such, as, semiconductors, the, word, ceramic, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, word, keramik, s, meaning, of, or, for, pottery, from, k, ramos, potter, s, clay, tile, pottery, the, earliest, known, mention, of, the, root, ceram, is, the, mycenaean, greek, ke, ra, me, we, workers, of, ceramic, written, in, linear, b, syllabic, script, the, word, ceramic, can, be, used, as, an, adjective, to, describe, a, material, product, or, process, or, it, may, be, used, as, a, noun, either, singular, or, more, commonly, as, the, plural, noun, ceramics, ceramic, material, is, an, inorganic, metallic, oxide, nitride, or, carbide, material, some, elements, such, as, carbon, or, silicon, may, be, considered, ceramics, ceramic, materials, are, brittle, hard, strong, in, compression, and, weak, in, shearing, and, tension, they, withstand, the, chemical, erosion, that, occurs, in, other, materials, subjected, to, acidic, or, caustic, environments, ceramics, generally, can, withstand, very, high, temperatures, ranging, from, 1, 000, c, to, 1, 600, c, 1, 800, f, to, 3, 000, f, the, crystallinity, of, ceramic, materials, varies, widely, most, often, fired, ceramics, are, either, vitrified, or, semi, vitrified, as, is, the, case, with, earthenware, stoneware, and, porcelain, varying, crystallinity, and, electron, composition, in, the, ionic, and, covalent, bonds, cause, most, ceramic, materials, to, be, good, thermal, and, electrical, insulators, researched, in, ceramic, engineering, with, such, a, large, range, of, possible, options, for, the, composition, structure, of, a, ceramic, nearly, all, of, the, elements, nearly, all, types, of, bonding, and, all, levels, of, crystallinity, the, breadth, of, the, subject, is, vast, and, identifiable, attributes, hardness, toughness, electrical, conductivity, are, difficult, to, specify, for, the, group, as, a, whole, general, properties, such, as, high, melting, temperature, high, hardness, poor, conductivity, high, moduli, of, elasticity, chemical, resistance, and, low, ductility, are, the, norm, with, known, exceptions, to, each, of, these, rules, piezoelectric, ceramics, glass, transition, temperature, superconductive, ceramics, composites, such, as, fiberglass, and, carbon, fiber, while, containing, ceramic, materials, are, not, considered, to, be, part, of, the, ceramic, family, highly, oriented, crystalline, ceramic, materials, are, not, amenable, to, a, great, range, of, processing, methods, for, dealing, with, them, tend, to, fall, into, one, of, two, categories, either, making, the, ceramic, in, the, desired, shape, by, reaction, in, situ, or, forming, powders, into, the, desired, shape, and, then, sintering, to, form, a, solid, body, ceramic, forming, techniques, include, shaping, by, hand, sometimes, including, a, rotation, process, called, throwing, slip, casting, tape, casting, used, for, making, very, thin, ceramic, capacitors, injection, molding, dry, pressing, and, other, variations, many, ceramics, experts, do, not, consider, materials, with, an, amorphous, noncrystalline, character, i, e, glass, to, be, ceramics, even, though, glassmaking, involves, several, steps, of, the, ceramic, process, and, its, mechanical, properties, are, similar, to, those, of, ceramic, materials, however, heat, treatments, can, convert, glass, into, a, semi, crystalline, material, known, as, glass, ceramic, traditional, ceramic, raw, materials, include, clay, minerals, such, as, kaolinite, whereas, more, recent, materials, include, aluminium, oxide, more, commonly, known, as, alumina, modern, ceramic, materials, which, are, classified, as, advanced, ceramics, include, silicon, carbide, and, tungsten, carbide, both, are, valued, for, their, abrasion, resistance, and, are, therefore, used, in, applications, such, as, the, wear, plates, of, crushing, equipment, in, mining, operations, advanced, ceramics, are, also, used, in, the, medical, electrical, electronics, and, armor, industries, human, beings, appear, to, have, been, making, their, own, ceramics, for, at, least, 26, 000, years, subjecting, clay, and, silica, to, intense, heat, to, fuse, and, form, ceramic, materials, the, earliest, found, so, far, were, in, southern, central, europe, and, were, sculpted, figures, not, dishes, the, earliest, known, pottery, was, made, by, mixing, animal, products, with, clay, and, firing, it, at, up, to, 800, c, 1, 500, f, while, pottery, fragments, have, been, found, up, to, 19, 000, years, old, it, was, not, until, about, 10, 000, years, later, that, regular, pottery, became, common, an, early, people, that, spread, across, much, of, europe, is, named, after, its, use, of, pottery, the, corded, ware, culture, these, early, indo, european, peoples, decorated, their, pottery, by, wrapping, it, with, rope, while, it, was, still, wet, when, the, ceramics, were, fired, the, rope, burned, off, but, left, a, decorative, pattern, of, complex, grooves, on, the, surface, the, invention, of, the, wheel, eventually, led, to, the, production, of, smoother, more, even, pottery, using, the, wheel, forming, throwing, technique, like, the, pottery, wheel, early, ceramics, were, porous, absorbing, water, easily, it, became, useful, for, more, items, with, the, discovery, of, glazing, techniques, which, involved, coating, pottery, with, silicon, bone, ash, or, other, materials, that, could, melt, and, reform, into, a, glassy, surface, making, a, vessel, less, pervious, to, water, ceramic, artifacts, have, an, important, role, in, archaeology, for, understanding, the, culture, technology, and, behavior, of, peoples, of, the, past, they, are, among, the, most, common, artifacts, to, be, found, at, an, archaeological, site, generally, in, the, form, of, small, fragments, of, broken, pottery, called, sherds, the, processing, of, collected, sherds, can, be, consistent, with, two, main, types, of, analysis, technical, and, traditional, the, traditional, analysis, involves, sorting, ceramic, artifacts, sherds, and, larger, fragments, into, specific, types, based, on, style, composition, manufacturing, and, morphology, by, creating, these, typologies, it, is, possible, to, distinguish, between, different, cultural, styles, the, purpose, of, the, ceramic, and, the, technological, state, of, the, people, among, other, conclusions, besides, by, looking, at, stylistic, changes, in, ceramics, over, time, it, is, possible, to, separate, seriate, the, ceramics, into, distinct, diagnostic, groups, assemblages, a, comparison, of, ceramic, artifacts, with, known, dated, assemblages, allows, for, a, chronological, assignment, of, these, pieces, the, technical, approach, to, ceramic, analysis, involves, a, finer, examination, of, the, composition, of, ceramic, artifacts, and, sherds, to, determine, the, source, of, the, material, and, through, this, the, possible, manufacturing, site, key, criteria, are, the, composition, of, the, clay, and, the, temper, used, in, the, manufacture, of, the, article, under, study, the, temper, is, a, material, added, to, the, clay, during, the, initial, production, stage, and, is, used, to, aid, the, subsequent, drying, process, types, of, temper, include, shell, pieces, granite, fragments, and, ground, sherd, pieces, called, grog, temper, is, usually, identified, by, microscopic, examination, of, the, tempered, material, clay, identification, is, determined, by, a, process, of, refiring, the, ceramic, and, assigning, a, color, to, it, using, munsell, soil, color, notation, by, estimating, both, the, clay, and, temper, compositions, and, locating, a, region, where, both, are, known, to, occur, an, assignment, of, the, material, source, can, be, made, based, on, the, source, assignment, of, the, artifact, further, investigations, can, be, made, into, the, site, of, manufacture, the, physical, properties, of, any, ceramic, substance, are, a, direct, result, of, its, crystalline, structure, and, chemical, composition, solid, state, chemistry, reveals, the, fundamental, connection, between, microstructure, and, properties, such, as, localized, density, variations, grain, size, distribution, type, of, porosity, and, second, phase, content, which, can, all, be, correlated, with, ceramic, properties, such, as, mechanical, strength, by, the, hall, petch, equation, hardness, toughness, dielectric, constant, and, the, optical, properties, exhibited, by, transparent, materials, ceramography, is, the, art, and, science, of, preparation, examination, and, evaluation, of, ceramic, microstructures, evaluation, and, characterization, of, ceramic, microstructures, are, often, implemented, on, similar, spatial, scales, to, that, used, commonly, in, the, emerging, field, of, nanotechnology, from, nanometers, to, tens, of, micrometers, m, this, is, typically, somewhere, between, the, minimum, wavelength, of, visible, light, and, the, resolution, limit, of, the, naked, eye, the, microstructure, includes, most, grains, secondary, phases, grain, boundaries, pores, micro, cracks, structural, defects, and, hardness, micro, indentions, most, bulk, mechanical, optical, thermal, electrical, and, magnetic, properties, are, significantly, affected, by, the, observed, microstructure, the, fabrication, method, and, process, conditions, are, generally, indicated, by, the, microstructure, the, root, cause, of, many, ceramic, failures, is, evident, in, the, cleaved, and, polished, microstructure, physical, properties, which, constitute, the, field, of, materials, science, and, engineering, include, the, following, mechanical, properties, are, important, in, structural, and, building, materials, as, well, as, textile, fabrics, in, modern, materials, science, fracture, mechanics, is, an, important, tool, in, improving, the, mechanical, performance, of, materials, and, components, it, applies, the, physics, of, stress, and, strain, in, particular, the, theories, of, elasticity, and, plasticity, to, the, microscopic, crystallographic, defects, found, in, real, materials, in, order, to, predict, the, macroscopic, mechanical, failure, of, bodies, fractography, is, widely, used, with, fracture, mechanics, to, understand, the, causes, of, failures, and, also, verify, the, theoretical, failure, predictions, with, real, life, failures, ceramic, materials, are, usually, ionic, or, covalent, bonded, materials, a, material, held, together, by, either, type, of, bond, will, tend, to, fracture, before, any, plastic, deformation, takes, place, which, results, in, poor, toughness, in, these, materials, additionally, because, these, materials, tend, to, be, porous, the, pores, and, other, microscopic, imperfections, act, as, stress, concentrators, decreasing, the, toughness, further, and, reducing, the, tensile, strength, these, combine, to, give, catastrophic, failures, as, opposed, to, the, more, ductile, failure, modes, of, metals, these, materials, do, show, plastic, deformation, however, because, of, the, rigid, structure, of, crystalline, material, there, are, very, few, available, slip, systems, for, dislocations, to, move, and, so, they, deform, very, slowly, to, overcome, the, brittle, behavior, ceramic, material, development, has, introduced, the, class, of, ceramic, matrix, composite, materials, in, which, ceramic, fibers, are, embedded, and, with, specific, coatings, are, forming, fiber, bridges, across, any, crack, this, mechanism, substantially, increases, the, fracture, toughness, of, such, ceramics, ceramic, disc, brakes, are, an, example, of, using, a, ceramic, matrix, composite, material, manufactured, with, a, specific, process, scientists, are, working, on, developing, ceramic, materials, that, can, withstand, significant, deformation, without, breaking, a, first, such, material, that, can, deform, in, room, temperature, was, found, in, 2024, if, a, ceramic, is, subjected, to, substantial, mechanical, loading, it, can, undergo, a, process, called, ice, templating, which, allows, some, control, of, the, microstructure, of, the, ceramic, product, and, therefore, some, control, of, the, mechanical, properties, ceramic, engineers, use, this, technique, to, tune, the, mechanical, properties, to, their, desired, application, specifically, the, strength, is, increased, when, this, technique, is, employed, ice, templating, allows, the, creation, of, macroscopic, pores, in, a, unidirectional, arrangement, the, applications, of, this, oxide, strengthening, technique, are, important, for, solid, oxide, fuel, cells, and, water, filtration, devices, to, process, a, sample, through, ice, templating, an, aqueous, colloidal, suspension, is, prepared, to, contain, the, dissolved, ceramic, powder, evenly, dispersed, throughout, the, colloid, for, example, yttria, stabilized, zirconia, ysz, the, solution, is, then, cooled, from, the, bottom, to, the, top, on, a, platform, that, allows, for, unidirectional, cooling, this, forces, ice, crystals, to, grow, in, compliance, with, the, unidirectional, cooling, and, these, ice, crystals, force, the, dissolved, ysz, particles, to, the, solidification, front, of, the, solid, liquid, interphase, boundary, resulting, in, pure, ice, crystals, lined, up, unidirectionally, alongside, concentrated, pockets, of, colloidal, particles, the, sample, is, then, heated, and, at, the, same, the, pressure, is, reduced, enough, to, force, the, ice, crystals, to, sublime, and, the, ysz, pockets, begin, to, anneal, together, to, form, macroscopically, aligned, ceramic, microstructures, the, sample, is, then, further, sintered, to, complete, the, evaporation, of, the, residual, water, and, the, final, consolidation, of, the, ceramic, microstructure, during, ice, templating, a, few, variables, can, be, controlled, to, influence, the, pore, size, and, morphology, of, the, microstructure, these, important, variables, are, the, initial, solids, loading, of, the, colloid, the, cooling, rate, the, sintering, temperature, and, duration, and, the, use, of, certain, additives, which, can, influence, the, microstructural, morphology, during, the, process, a, good, understanding, of, these, parameters, is, essential, to, understanding, the, relationships, between, processing, microstructure, and, mechanical, properties, of, anisotropically, porous, materials, some, ceramics, are, semiconductors, most, of, these, are, transition, metal, oxides, that, are, ii, vi, semiconductors, such, as, zinc, oxide, while, there, are, prospects, of, mass, producing, blue, leds, from, zinc, oxide, ceramicists, are, most, interested, in, the, electrical, properties, that, show, grain, boundary, effects, one, of, the, most, widely, used, of, these, is, the, varistor, these, are, devices, that, exhibit, the, property, that, resistance, drops, sharply, at, a, certain, threshold, voltage, once, the, voltage, across, the, device, reaches, the, threshold, there, is, a, breakdown, of, the, electrical, structure, in, the, vicinity, of, the, grain, boundaries, which, results, in, its, electrical, resistance, dropping, from, several, megohms, down, to, a, few, hundred, ohms, the, major, advantage, of, these, is, that, they, can, dissipate, a, lot, of, energy, and, they, self, reset, after, the, voltage, across, the, device, drops, below, the, threshold, its, resistance, returns, to, being, high, this, makes, them, ideal, for, surge, protection, applications, as, there, is, control, over, the, threshold, voltage, and, energy, tolerance, they, find, use, in, all, sorts, of, applications, the, best, demonstration, of, their, ability, can, be, found, in, electrical, substations, where, they, are, employed, to, protect, the, infrastructure, from, lightning, strikes, they, have, rapid, response, are, low, maintenance, and, do, not, appreciably, degrade, from, use, making, them, virtually, ideal, devices, for, this, application, semiconducting, ceramics, are, also, employed, as, gas, sensors, when, various, gases, are, passed, over, a, polycrystalline, ceramic, its, electrical, resistance, changes, with, tuning, to, the, possible, gas, mixtures, very, inexpensive, devices, can, be, produced, under, some, conditions, such, as, extremely, low, temperatures, some, ceramics, exhibit, high, temperature, superconductivity, in, superconductivity, high, temperature, means, above, 30, k, the, reason, for, this, is, not, understood, but, there, are, two, major, families, of, superconducting, ceramics, piezoelectricity, a, link, between, electrical, and, mechanical, response, is, exhibited, by, a, large, number, of, ceramic, materials, including, the, quartz, used, to, measure, time, in, watches, and, other, electronics, such, devices, use, both, properties, of, piezoelectrics, using, electricity, to, produce, a, mechanical, motion, powering, the, device, and, then, using, this, mechanical, motion, to, produce, electricity, generating, a, signal, the, unit, of, time, measured, is, the, natural, interval, required, for, electricity, to, be, converted, into, mechanical, energy, and, back, again, the, piezoelectric, effect, is, generally, stronger, in, materials, that, also, exhibit, pyroelectricity, and, all, pyroelectric, materials, are, also, piezoelectric, these, materials, can, be, used, to, inter, convert, between, thermal, mechanical, or, electrical, energy, for, instance, after, synthesis, in, a, furnace, a, pyroelectric, crystal, allowed, to, cool, under, no, applied, stress, generally, builds, up, a, static, charge, of, thousands, of, volts, such, materials, are, used, in, motion, sensors, where, the, tiny, rise, in, temperature, from, a, warm, body, entering, the, room, is, enough, to, produce, a, measurable, voltage, in, the, crystal, in, turn, pyroelectricity, is, seen, most, strongly, in, materials, that, also, display, the, ferroelectric, effect, in, which, a, stable, electric, dipole, can, be, oriented, or, reversed, by, applying, an, electrostatic, field, pyroelectricity, is, also, a, necessary, consequence, of, ferroelectricity, this, can, be, used, to, store, information, in, ferroelectric, capacitors, elements, of, ferroelectric, ram, the, most, common, such, materials, are, lead, zirconate, titanate, and, barium, titanate, aside, from, the, uses, mentioned, above, their, strong, piezoelectric, response, is, exploited, in, the, design, of, high, frequency, loudspeakers, transducers, for, sonar, and, actuators, for, atomic, force, and, scanning, tunneling, microscopes, temperature, increases, can, cause, grain, boundaries, to, suddenly, become, insulating, in, some, semiconducting, ceramic, materials, mostly, mixtures, of, heavy, metal, titanates, the, critical, transition, temperature, can, be, adjusted, over, a, wide, range, by, variations, in, chemistry, in, such, materials, current, will, pass, through, the, material, until, joule, heating, brings, it, to, the, transition, temperature, at, which, point, the, circuit, will, be, broken, and, current, flow, will, cease, such, ceramics, are, used, as, self, controlled, heating, elements, in, for, example, the, rear, window, defrost, circuits, of, automobiles, at, the, transition, temperature, the, material, s, dielectric, response, becomes, theoretically, infinite, while, a, lack, of, temperature, control, would, rule, out, any, practical, use, of, the, material, near, its, critical, temperature, the, dielectric, effect, remains, exceptionally, strong, even, at, much, higher, temperatures, titanates, with, critical, temperatures, far, below, room, temperature, have, become, synonymous, with, ceramic, in, the, context, of, ceramic, capacitors, for, just, this, reason, optically, transparent, materials, focus, on, the, response, of, a, material, to, incoming, light, waves, of, a, range, of, wavelengths, frequency, selective, optical, filters, can, be, utilized, to, alter, or, enhance, the, brightness, and, contrast, of, a, digital, image, guided, lightwave, transmission, via, frequency, selective, waveguides, involves, the, emerging, field, of, fiber, optics, and, the, ability, of, certain, glassy, compositions, as, a, transmission, medium, for, a, range, of, frequencies, simultaneously, multi, mode, optical, fiber, with, little, or, no, interference, between, competing, wavelengths, or, frequencies, this, resonant, mode, of, energy, and, data, transmission, via, electromagnetic, light, wave, propagation, though, low, powered, is, virtually, lossless, optical, waveguides, are, used, as, components, in, integrated, optical, circuits, e, g, light, emitting, diodes, leds, or, as, the, transmission, medium, in, local, and, long, haul, optical, communication, systems, also, of, value, to, the, emerging, materials, scientist, is, the, sensitivity, of, materials, to, radiation, in, the, thermal, infrared, ir, portion, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, this, heat, seeking, ability, is, responsible, for, such, diverse, optical, phenomena, as, night, vision, and, ir, luminescence, thus, there, is, an, increasing, need, in, the, military, sector, for, high, strength, robust, materials, which, have, the, capability, to, transmit, light, electromagnetic, waves, in, the, visible, 0, 4, 0, 7, micrometers, and, mid, infrared, 1, 5, micrometers, regions, of, the, spectrum, these, materials, are, needed, for, applications, requiring, transparent, armor, including, next, generation, high, speed, missiles, and, pods, as, well, as, protection, against, improvised, explosive, devices, ied, in, the, 1960s, scientists, at, general, electric, ge, discovered, that, under, the, right, manufacturing, conditions, some, ceramics, especially, aluminium, oxide, alumina, could, be, made, translucent, these, translucent, materials, were, transparent, enough, to, be, used, for, containing, the, electrical, plasma, generated, in, high, pressure, sodium, street, lamps, during, the, past, two, decades, additional, types, of, transparent, ceramics, have, been, developed, for, applications, such, as, nose, cones, for, heat, seeking, missiles, windows, for, fighter, aircraft, and, scintillation, counters, for, computed, tomography, scanners, other, ceramic, materials, generally, requiring, greater, purity, in, their, make, up, than, those, above, include, forms, of, several, chemical, compounds, including, for, convenience, ceramic, products, are, usually, divided, into, four, main, types, these, are, shown, below, with, some, examples, frequently, the, raw, materials, of, modern, ceramics, do, not, include, clays, those, that, do, have, been, classified, as, ceramics, can, also, be, classified, into, three, distinct, material, categories, each, one, of, these, classes, can, be, developed, into, unique, material, properties
