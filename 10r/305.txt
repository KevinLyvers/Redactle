of, the, 2011, census, 52, per, cent, of, all, homes, were, flats, many, of, these, were, built, as, georgian, or, victorian, houses, and, subsequently, divided, up, many, others, were, built, as, council, flats, many, tower, blocks, were, built, after, the, second, world, war, a, number, of, these, have, been, demolished, and, replaced, with, low, rise, buildings, or, housing, estates, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, concept, of, the, flat, was, slow, to, catch, on, amongst, the, british, middle, classes, which, generally, followed, the, north, european, standard, of, single, family, houses, dating, far, back, into, history, those, who, lived, in, flats, were, assumed, to, be, lower, class, and, somewhat, itinerant, renting, for, example, a, flat, above, a, shop, as, part, of, a, lease, agreement, for, a, tradesman, in, london, and, most, of, britain, everyone, who, could, afford, to, do, so, occupied, an, entire, house, even, if, this, was, a, small, terraced, house, while, the, working, poor, continued, to, rent, rooms, in, often, overcrowded, properties, with, one, or, more, families, per, room, during, the, last, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, as, wealth, increased, ideas, began, to, change, both, urban, growth, and, the, increase, in, population, meant, that, more, imaginative, housing, concepts, would, be, needed, if, the, middle, and, upper, classes, were, to, maintain, a, pied, terre, in, the, capital, the, traditional, london, town, house, was, becoming, increasingly, expensive, to, maintain, for, bachelors, and, unmarried, women, in, particular, the, idea, of, renting, a, modern, mansion, flat, became, increasingly, popular, the, first, mansion, flats, in, england, were, in, scotland, the, term, tenement, lacks, the, pejorative, connotations, it, carries, elsewhere, and, refers, simply, to, any, block, of, flats, sharing, a, common, central, staircase, and, lacking, an, elevator, particularly, those, constructed, before, 1919, tenements, were, and, continue, to, be, inhabited, by, a, wide, range, of, social, classes, and, income, groups, tenements, today, are, bought, by, a, wide, range, of, social, types, including, young, professionals, older, retirees, and, by, absentee, landlords, often, for, rental, to, students, after, they, leave, halls, of, residence, managed, by, their, institution, the, national, trust, for, scotland, tenement, house, glasgow, is, a, historic, house, museum, offering, an, insight, into, the, lifestyle, of, tenement, dwellers, as, it, was, generations, ago, during, the, 19th, century, tenements, became, the, predominant, type, of, new, housing, in, scotland, s, industrial, cities, although, they, were, very, common, in, the, old, town, in, edinburgh, from, the, 15th, century, where, they, reached, ten, or, eleven, storeys, and, in, one, case, fourteen, storeys, built, of, sandstone, or, granite, scottish, tenements, are, usually, three, to, five, storeys, in, height, with, two, to, four, flats, on, each, floor, in, contrast, industrial, cities, in, england, tended, to, favour, back, to, back, terraces, of, brick, scottish, tenements, are, constructed, in, terraces, and, each, entrance, within, a, block, is, referred, to, as, a, close, or, stair, both, referring, to, the, shared, passageway, to, the, individual, flats, flights, of, stairs, and, landings, are, generally, designated, common, areas, and, residents, traditionally, took, turns, to, sweep, clean, the, floors, and, in, aberdeen, in, particular, took, turns, to, make, use, of, shared, laundry, facilities, in, the, back, green, garden, or, yard, it, is, now, more, common, for, cleaning, of, the, common, ways, to, be, contracted, out, through, a, managing, agent, or, factor, in, glasgow, where, scotland, s, highest, concentration, of, tenement, dwellings, can, be, found, the, urban, renewal, projects, of, the, 1950s, 1960s, and, 1970s, brought, an, end, to, the, city, s, slums, which, had, primarily, consisted, of, older, tenements, built, in, the, early, 19th, century, in, which, large, extended, families, would, live, together, in, cramped, conditions, they, were, replaced, by, high, rise, blocks, that, within, a, couple, of, decades, became, notorious, for, crime, and, poverty, the, glasgow, corporation, made, many, efforts, to, improve, the, situation, most, successfully, with, the, city, improvement, trust, which, cleared, the, slums, of, the, old, town, replacing, them, with, what, they, thought, of, as, a, traditional, high, street, which, remains, an, imposing, townscape, the, city, halls, and, the, cleland, testimonial, were, part, of, this, scheme, national, government, help, was, given, following, world, war, i, when, housing, acts, sought, to, provide, homes, fit, for, heroes, garden, suburb, areas, based, on, english, models, such, as, knightswood, were, set, up, these, proved, too, expensive, so, a, modern, tenement, three, stories, high, slate, roofed, and, built, of, reconstituted, stone, was, re, introduced, and, a, slum, clearance, programme, initiated, to, clear, areas, such, as, the, calton, and, the, garngad, after, world, war, ii, more, ambitious, plans, known, as, the, bruce, plan, were, made, for, the, complete, evacuation, of, slums, for, modern, mid, rise, housing, developments, on, the, outskirts, of, the, city, however, the, central, government, refused, to, fund, the, plans, preferring, instead, to, depopulate, the, city, to, a, series, of, new, towns, again, economic, considerations, meant, that, many, of, the, planned, new, town, amenities, were, never, built, in, these, areas, these, housing, estates, known, as, schemes, came, therefore, to, be, widely, regarded, as, unsuccessful, many, such, as, castlemilk, were, just, dormitories, well, away, from, the, centre, of, the, city, with, no, amenities, such, as, shops, and, public, houses, deserts, with, windows, as, billy, connolly, once, put, it, high, rise, living, too, started, off, with, bright, ambition, the, moss, heights, built, in, the, 1950s, are, still, desirable, but, fell, prey, to, later, economic, pressure, many, of, the, later, tower, blocks, were, poorly, designed, and, cheaply, built, and, their, anonymity, caused, some, social, problems, the, demolition, of, the, tower, blocks, in, order, to, build, modern, housing, schemes, has, in, some, cases, led, to, a, re, interpretations, of, the, tenement, in, 1970, a, team, from, strathclyde, university, demonstrated, that, the, old, tenements, had, been, basically, sound, and, could, be, given, new, life, with, replumbing, providing, modern, kitchens, and, bathrooms, the, corporation, acted, on, this, principle, for, the, first, time, in, 1973, at, the, old, swan, corner, pollokshaws, thereafter, housing, action, areas, were, set, up, to, renovate, so, called, slums, later, privately, owned, tenements, benefited, from, government, help, in, stone, cleaning, revealing, a, honey, coloured, sandstone, behind, the, presumed, grey, tenemental, facades, the, policy, of, tenement, demolition, is, now, considered, to, have, been, short, sighted, wasteful, and, largely, unsuccessful, many, of, glasgow, s, worst, tenements, were, refurbished, into, desirable, accommodation, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, and, the, policy, of, demolition, is, considered, to, have, destroyed, fine, examples, of, a, universally, admired, architectural, style, the, glasgow, housing, association, took, ownership, of, the, public, housing, stock, from, the, city, council, on, 7, march, 2003, and, has, begun, a, 96, million, clearance, and, demolition, programme, to, clear, and, demolish, many, of, the, high, rise, flats, in, 1839, the, first, new, york, city, tenement, was, built, and, soon, became, breeding, grounds, for, outlaws, juvenile, delinquents, and, organized, crime, tenements, or, their, slum, landlords, were, also, known, for, their, price, gouging, rent, how, the, other, half, lives, notes, one, tenement, district, blind, man, s, alley, bear, its, name, for, a, reason, until, little, more, than, a, year, ago, its, dark, burrows, harbored, a, colony, of, blind, beggars, tenants, of, a, blind, landlord, old, daniel, murphy, whom, every, child, in, the, ward, knows, if, he, never, heard, of, the, president, of, the, united, states, old, dan, made, a, big, fortune, he, told, me, once, four, hundred, thousand, dollars, out, of, his, alley, and, the, surrounding, tenements, only, to, grow, blind, himself, in, extreme, old, age, sharing, in, the, end, the, chief, hardship, of, the, wretched, beings, whose, lot, he, had, stubbornly, refused, to, better, that, he, might, increase, his, wealth, even, when, the, board, of, health, at, last, compelled, him, to, repair, and, clean, up, the, worst, of, the, old, buildings, under, threat, of, driving, out, the, tenants, and, locking, the, doors, behind, them, the, work, was, accomplished, against, the, old, man, s, angry, protests, he, appeared, in, person, before, the, board, to, argue, his, case, and, his, argument, was, characteristic, i, have, made, my, will, he, said, my, monument, stands, waiting, for, me, in, calvary, i, stand, on, the, very, brink, of, the, grave, blind, and, helpless, and, now, here, the, pathos, of, the, appeal, was, swept, under, in, a, burst, of, angry, indignation, do, you, want, me, to, build, and, get, skinned, skinned, these, people, are, not, fit, to, live, in, a, nice, house, let, them, go, where, they, can, and, let, my, house, stand, in, spite, of, the, genuine, anguish, of, the, appeal, it, was, downright, amusing, to, find, that, his, anger, was, provoked, less, by, the, anticipated, waste, of, luxury, on, his, tenants, than, by, distrust, of, his, own, kind, the, builder, he, knew, intuitively, what, to, expect, the, result, showed, that, mr, murphy, had, gauged, his, tenants, correctly, many, campaigners, such, as, upton, sinclair, and, jacob, riis, pushed, for, reforms, in, tenement, dwellings, as, a, result, the, new, york, state, tenement, house, act, was, passed, in, 1901, to, improve, the, conditions, more, improvements, followed, in, 1949, president, harry, s, truman, signed, the, housing, act, of, 1949, to, clean, slums, and, reconstruct, housing, units, for, the, poor, the, dakota, 1884, was, one, of, the, first, luxury, apartment, buildings, in, new, york, city, the, majority, however, remained, tenements, some, significant, developments, in, architectural, design, of, apartment, buildings, came, out, of, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, among, them, were, groundbreaking, designs, in, the, 860, 880, lake, shore, drive, apartments, 1951, new, century, guild, 1961, marina, city, 1964, and, lake, point, tower, 1968, in, the, united, states, tenement, is, a, label, usually, applied, to, the, less, expensive, more, basic, rental, apartment, buildings, in, older, sections, of, large, cities, many, of, these, apartment, buildings, are, walk, ups, without, an, elevator, and, some, have, shared, bathing, facilities, though, this, is, becoming, less, common, the, slang, term, dingbat, is, used, to, describe, cheap, urban, apartment, buildings, from, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, with, unique, and, often, wacky, fa, ades, to, differentiate, themselves, within, a, full, block, of, apartments, they, are, often, built, on, stilts, and, with, parking, underneath, apartments, were, popular, in, canada, particularly, in, urban, centres, like, vancouver, toronto, ottawa, montreal, and, hamilton, in, the, 1950s, to, 1970s, by, the, 1980s, many, multi, unit, buildings, were, being, constructed, as, condominiums, instead, of, apartments, both, are, now, very, common, in, toronto, and, vancouver, high, rise, apartments, and, condominiums, have, been, spread, around, the, city, giving, even,

maintenance, of, common, premises, many, apartments, are, owned, through, strata, title, australian, legislation, enforces, a, minimum, 2, 4, m, floor, ceiling, height, which, differentiates, apartment, buildings, from, office, buildings, australia, has, a, relatively, recent, history, in, apartment, buildings, terrace, houses, were, the, early, response, to, density, development, though,

of, land, prevention, act, 1885, the, earliest, apartment, buildings, were, in, the, major, cities, of, sydney, and, melbourne, as, the, response, to, fast, rising, land, values, both, cities, are,

in, the, st, kilda, area, including, the, fawkner, mansions, 1910, majestic, mansions, 1912, as, a, boarding, house, and, the, canterbury, 1914, the, oldest, surviving, buildings, contained, flats,

melbourne, particularly, in, areas, such, as, st, kilda, and, south, yarra, sydney, particularly, in, areas, such, as, potts, point, darlinghust, and, kings, cross, and, in, brisbane, in, areas, such, as, new, farm, fortitude, valley, and, spring, hill, post, world, war, ii, with, the, australian, dream, apartment, buildings, went, out, of, vogue, and, flats, were, seen, as, accommodation, only, for, the, poor, walk, up, flats, without, a, lift, of, two, to, three, storeys, however, were, common, in, the, middle, suburbs, of, cities, for, lower, income, groups, the, main, exceptions, were, sydney, and, the, gold, coast, queensland, where, apartment, development, continued, for, more, than, half, a, century, in, sydney, a, limited, geography, and, highly, sought, after, waterfront, views, sydney, harbour, and, beaches, such, as, bondi, made, apartment, living, socially, acceptable, since, the, 1960s, these, cities, maintained, much, higher, population, densities, than, the, rest, of, australia, through, the, acceptance, of, apartment, buildings, in, other, cities, apartment, building, was, almost, solely, restricted, to, public, housing, public, housing, in, australia, was, common, in, the, larger, cities, particularly, in, melbourne, by, the, housing, commission, of, victoria, where, a, number, of, high, rise, housing, commission, flats, were, built, between, the, 1950s, and, 1970s, by, successive, governments, as, part, of, an, urban, renewal, program, areas, affected, included, fitzroy, flemington, collingwood, carlton, richmond, and, prahran, similar, projects, were, run, in, sydney, s, lower, socio, economic, areas, like, redfern, in, the, 1980s, modern, apartment, buildings, sprang, up, in, riverside, locations, in, brisbane, along, the, brisbane, river, and, perth, along, the, swan, river, in, melbourne, in, the, 1990s, a, trend, began, for, apartment, buildings, without, the, requirement, of, spectacular, views, as, a, continuation, of, the, gentrification, of, the, inner, city, a, fashion, became, new, york, loft, style, apartments, see, above, and, a, large, stock, of, old, warehouses, and, old, abandoned, office, buildings, in, and, around, the, central, business, district, became, the, target, of, developers, the, trend, of, adaptive, reuse, extended, to, conversion, of, old, churches, and, schools, similar, warehouse, conversions, and, gentrification, began, in, brisbane, suburbs, such, as, teneriffe, queensland, and, fortitude, valley, and, in, sydney, in, areas, such, as, ultimo, as, the, supply, of, buildings, for, conversion, ran, out, reproduction, and, modern, high, rise, apartments, followed, this, was, particularly, the, case, in, melbourne, thanks, to, official, planning, policies, postcode, 3000, making, the, cbd, the, fastest, growing, population, wise, in, the, country, apartment, building, in, the, melbourne, metropolitan, area, has, also, escalated, with, the, advent, of, the, melbourne, 2030, planning, policy, urban, renewal, areas, like, docklands, southbank, st, kilda, road, and, port, melbourne, are, now, predominantly, apartments, there, has, also, been, a, sharp, increase, in, the, number, of, student, apartment, buildings, in, areas, such, as, carlton, in, melbourne, despite, their, size, other, smaller, cities, including, canberra, darwin, townsville, cairns, newcastle, wollongong, adelaide, and, geelong, have, begun, building, apartments, in, the, 2000s, today, residential, buildings, such, as, the, eureka, tower, and, q1, are, among, the, tallest, in, the, country, as, of, 2019, a, majority, of, koreans, live, in, apartments, since, the, 1980s, the, number, of, apartment, residents, has, soared, and, as, the, number, of, apartments, has, steadily, increased, apartments, have, become, a, representative, form, of, residence, where, more, than, half, of, the, korean, population, resides, it, is, the, most, common, house, in, small, and, medium, sized, cities, in, korea, and, even, these, days, apartments, are, quite, visible, in, rural, areas, such, as, remote, areas, this, is, because, small, and, medium, sized, construction, companies, have, technology, but, they, lack, the, capital, to, build, large, complexes, in, large, cities, the, better, the, location, the, more, expensive, the, apartment, is, and, the, more, expensive, the, apartment, complex, built, by, a, large, construction, company, and, with, a, large, number, of, households, also, even, the, same, type, of, flat, in, the, same, complex, is, not, all, of, the, same, price, due, to, problems, such, as, the, right, to, sunlight, and, prospects, the, low, rise, households, on, the, first, and, third, floors, are, generally, the, cheapest, and, the, higher, they, go, the, more, expensive, they, become, in, addition, the, price, varies, depending, on, other, conditions, such, as, the, viewing, area, and, the, direction, of, the, house, such, as, south, east, west, and, north, the, upper, floors, with, a, south, facing, view, are, the, most, expensive, apartment, sales, and, lease, prices, are, actually, the, largest, and, most, stable, assets, owned, by, a, middle, class, family, in, korea, symbolizing, the, social, status, of, a, family, which, forms, a, class, and, determines, life, satisfaction, for, this, reason, the, korean, people, have, no, choice, but, to, react, very, sensitively, to, apartment, prices
