electronics, is, a, scientific, and, engineering, discipline, that, studies, and, applies, the, principles, of, physics, to, design, create, and, operate, devices, that, manipulate, electrons, and, other, electrically, charged, particles, electronics, is, a, subfield, of, physics, and, electrical, engineering, which, uses, active, devices, such, as, transistors, diodes, and, integrated, circuits, to, control, and, amplify, the, flow, of, electric, current, and, to, convert, it, from, one, form, to, another, such, as, from, alternating, current, ac, to, direct, current, dc, or, from, analog, signals, to, digital, signals, electronic, devices, have, hugely, influenced, the, development, of, many, aspects, of, modern, society, such, as, telecommunications, entertainment, education, health, care, industry, and, security, the, main, driving, force, behind, the, advancement, of, electronics, is, the, semiconductor, industry, which, in, response, to, global, demand, continually, produces, ever, more, sophisticated, electronic, devices, and, circuits, the, semiconductor, industry, is, one, of, the, largest, and, most, profitable, sectors, in, the, global, economy, with, annual, revenues, exceeding, 481, billion, in, 2018, the, electronics, industry, also, encompasses, other, sectors, that, rely, on, electronic, devices, and, systems, such, as, e, commerce, which, generated, over, 29, trillion, in, online, sales, in, 2017, the, identification, of, the, electron, in, 1897, by, sir, joseph, john, thomson, along, with, the, subsequent, invention, of, the, vacuum, tube, which, could, amplify, and, rectify, small, electrical, signals, inaugurated, the, field, of, electronics, and, the, electron, age, practical, applications, started, with, the, invention, of, the, diode, by, ambrose, fleming, and, the, triode, by, lee, de, forest, in, the, early, 1900s, which, made, the, detection, of, small, electrical, voltages, such, as, radio, signals, from, a, radio, antenna, practicable, vacuum, tubes, thermionic, valves, were, the, first, active, electronic, components, which, controlled, current, flow, by, influencing, the, flow, of, individual, electrons, and, enabled, the, construction, of, equipment, that, used, current, amplification, and, rectification, to, give, us, radio, television, radar, long, distance, telephony, and, much, more, the, early, growth, of, electronics, was, rapid, and, by, the, 1920s, commercial, radio, broadcasting, and, telecommunications, were, becoming, widespread, and, electronic, amplifiers, were, being, used, in, such, diverse, applications, as, long, distance, telephony, and, the, music, recording, industry, the, next, big, technological, step, took, several, decades, to, appear, when, the, first, working, point, contact, transistor, was, invented, by, john, bardeen, and, walter, houser, brattain, at, bell, labs, in, 1947, however, vacuum, tubes, played, a, leading, role, in, the, field, of, microwave, and, high, power, transmission, as, well, as, television, receivers, until, the, middle, of, the, 1980s, since, then, solid, state, devices, have, all, but, completely, taken, over, vacuum, tubes, are, still, used, in, some, specialist, applications, such, as, high, power, rf, amplifiers, cathode, ray, tubes, specialist, audio, equipment, guitar, amplifiers, and, some, microwave, devices, in, april, 1955, the, ibm, 608, was, the, first, ibm, product, to, use, transistor, circuits, without, any, vacuum, tubes, and, is, believed, to, be, the, first, all, transistorized, calculator, to, be, manufactured, for, the, commercial, market, the, 608, contained, more, than, 3, 000, germanium, transistors, thomas, j, watson, jr, ordered, all, future, ibm, products, to, use, transistors, in, their, design, from, that, time, on, transistors, were, almost, exclusively, used, for, computer, logic, circuits, and, peripheral, devices, however, early, junction, transistors, were, relatively, bulky, devices, that, were, difficult, to, manufacture, on, a, mass, production, basis, which, limited, them, to, a, number, of, specialised, applications, the, mosfet, was, invented, at, bell, labs, between, 1955, and, 1960, it, was, the, first, truly, compact, transistor, that, could, be, miniaturised, and, mass, produced, for, a, wide, range, of, uses, its, advantages, include, high, scalability, affordability, low, power, consumption, and, high, density, it, revolutionized, the, electronics, industry, becoming, the, most, widely, used, electronic, device, in, the, world, the, mosfet, is, the, basic, element, in, most, modern, electronic, equipment, as, the, complexity, of, circuits, grew, problems, arose, one, problem, was, the, size, of, the, circuit, a, complex, circuit, like, a, computer, was, dependent, on, speed, if, the, components, were, large, the, wires, interconnecting, them, must, be, long, the, electric, signals, took, time, to, go, through, the, circuit, thus, slowing, the, computer, the, invention, of, the, integrated, circuit, by, jack, kilby, and, robert, noyce, solved, this, problem, by, making, all, the, components, and, the, chip, out, of, the, same, block, monolith, of, semiconductor, material, the, circuits, could, be, made, smaller, and, the, manufacturing, process, could, be, automated, this, led, to, the, idea, of, integrating, all, components, on, a, single, crystal, silicon, wafer, which, led, to, small, scale, integration, ssi, in, the, early, 1960s, and, then, medium, scale, integration, msi, in, the, late, 1960s, followed, by, vlsi, in, 2008, billion, transistor, processors, became, commercially, available, an, electronic, component, is, any, component, in, an, electronic, system, either, active, or, passive, components, are, connected, together, usually, by, being, soldered, to, a, printed, circuit, board, pcb, to, create, an, electronic, circuit, with, a, particular, function, components, may, be, packaged, singly, or, in, more, complex, groups, as, integrated, circuits, passive, electronic, components, are, capacitors, inductors, resistors, whilst, active, components, are, such, as, semiconductor, devices, transistors, and, thyristors, which, control, current, flow, at, electron, level, electronic, circuit, functions, can, be, divided, into, two, function, groups, analog, and, digital, a, particular, device, may, consist, of, circuitry, that, has, either, or, a, mix, of, the, two, types, analog, circuits, are, becoming, less, common, as, many, of, their, functions, are, being, digitized, analog, circuits, use, a, continuous, range, of, voltage, or, current, for, signal, processing, as, opposed, to, the, discrete, levels, used, in, digital, circuits, analog, circuits, were, common, throughout, an, electronic, device, in, the, early, years, in, devices, such, as, radio, receivers, and, transmitters, analog, electronic, computers, were, valuable, for, solving, problems, with, continuous, variables, until, digital, processing, advanced, as, semiconductor, technology, developed, many, of, the, functions, of, analog, circuits, were, taken, over, by, digital, circuits, and, modern, circuits, that, are, entirely, analog, are, less, common, their, functions, being, replaced, by, hybrid, approach, which, for, instance, uses, analog, circuits, at, the, front, end, of, a, device, receiving, an, analog, signal, and, then, use, digital, processing, using, microprocessor, techniques, thereafter, sometimes, it, may, be, difficult, to, classify, some, circuits, that, have, elements, of, both, linear, and, non, linear, operation, an, example, is, the, voltage, comparator, which, receives, a, continuous, range, of, voltage, but, only, outputs, one, of, two, levels, as, in, a, digital, circuit, similarly, an, overdriven, transistor, amplifier, can, take, on, the, characteristics, of, a, controlled, switch, having, essentially, two, levels, of, output, analog, circuits, are, still, widely, used, for, signal, amplification, such, as, in, the, entertainment, industry, and, conditioning, signals, from, analog, sensors, such, as, in, industrial, measurement, and, control, digital, circuits, are, electric, circuits, based, on, discrete, voltage, levels, digital, circuits, use, boolean, algebra, and, are, the, basis, of, all, digital, computers, and, microprocessor, devices, they, range, from, simple, logic, gates, to, large, integrated, circuits, employing, millions, of, such, gates, digital, circuits, use, a, binary, system, with, two, voltage, levels, labelled, 0, and, 1, to, indicated, logical, status, often, logic, 0, will, be, a, lower, voltage, and, referred, to, as, low, while, logic, 1, is, referred, to, as, high, however, some, systems, use, the, reverse, definition, 0, is, high, or, are, current, based, quite, often, the, logic, designer, may, reverse, these, definitions, from, one, circuit, to, the, next, as, they, see, fit, to, facilitate, their, design, the, definition, of, the, levels, as, 0, or, 1, is, arbitrary, ternary, with, three, states, logic, has, been, studied, and, some, prototype, computers, made, but, have, not, gained, any, significant, practical, acceptance, universally, computers, and, digital, signal, processors, are, constructed, with, digital, circuits, using, transistors, such, as, mosfets, in, the, electronic, logic, gates, to, generate, binary, states, highly, integrated, devices, electronic, systems, design, deals, with, the, multi, disciplinary,

electronic, system, new, product, development, to, assuring, its, proper, function, service, life, and, disposal, electronic, systems, design, is, therefore, the, process, of, defining, and, developing, complex, electronic, devices, to, satisfy, specified, requirements, of, the, user, due, to, the, complex, nature, of, electronics, theory, laboratory, experimentation, is, an, important, part, of, the, development, of, electronic, devices, these, experiments, are, used, to, test, or, verify, the, engineer, s, design, and, detect, errors, historically, electronics, labs, have, consisted, of, electronics, devices, and, equipment, located, in, a, physical, space, although, in, more, recent, years, the, trend, has, been, towards, electronics, lab, simulation, software, such, as, circuitlogix, multisim, and, pspice, today, s, electronics, engineers, have, the, ability, to, design, circuits, using, premanufactured, building, blocks, such, as, power, supplies,

electronic, circuits, noise, may, be, electromagnetically, or, thermally, generated, which, can, be, decreased, by, lowering, the, operating, temperature, of, the, circuit, other, types, of, noise, such, as, shot, noise, cannot, be, removed, as, they, are, due, to, limitations, in, physical, properties, many, different, methods, of, connecting, components, have, been, used, over, the, years, for, instance, early, electronics, often, used, point, to, point, wiring, with, components, attached, to, wooden, breadboards, to, construct, circuits, cordwood, construction, and, wire, wrap, were,
