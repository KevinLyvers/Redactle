https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_production
mass, production, also, known, as, flow, production, series, production, series, manufacture, or, continuous, production, is, the, production, of, substantial, amounts, of, standardized, products, in, a, constant, flow, including, and, especially, on, assembly, lines, together, with, job, production, and, batch, production, it, is, one, of, the, three, main, production, methods, the, term, mass, production, was, popularized, by, a, 1926, article, in, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, supplement, that, was, written, based, on, correspondence, with, ford, motor, company, the, new, york, times, used, the, term, in, the, title, of, an, article, that, appeared, before, the, publication, of, the, britannica, article, the, idea, of, mass, production, is, applied, to, many, kinds, of, products, from, fluids, and, particulates, handled, in, bulk, food, fuel, chemicals, and, mined, minerals, to, clothing, textiles, parts, and, assemblies, of, parts, household, appliances, and, automobiles, some, mass, production, techniques, such, as, standardized, sizes, and, production, lines, predate, the, industrial, revolution, by, many, centuries, however, it, was, not, until, the, introduction, of, machine, tools, and, techniques, to, produce, interchangeable, parts, were, developed, in, the, mid, 19th, century, that, modern, mass, production, was, possible, mass, production, involves, making, many, copies, of, products, very, quickly, using, assembly, line, techniques, to, send, partially, complete, products, to, workers, who, each, work, on, an, individual, step, rather, than, having, a, worker, work, on, a, whole, product, from, start, to, finish, the, emergence, of, mass, production, allowed, supply, to, outstrip, demand, in, many, markets, forcing, companies, to, seek, new, ways, to, become, more, competitive, mass, production, ties, into, the, idea, of, overconsumption, and, the, idea, that, we, as, humans, consume, too, much, mass, production, of, fluid, matter, typically, involves, piping, with, centrifugal, pumps, or, screw, conveyors, augers, to, transfer, raw, materials, or, partially, complete, products, between, vessels, fluid, flow, processes, such, as, oil, refining, and, bulk, materials, such, as, wood, chips, and, pulp, are, automated, using, a, system, of, process, control, which, uses, various, instruments, to, measure, variables, such, as, temperature, pressure, volumetric, and, level, providing, feedback, bulk, materials, such, as, coal, ores, grains, and, wood, chips, are, handled, by, belt, chain, slat, pneumatic, or, screw, conveyors, bucket, elevators, and, mobile, equipment, such, as, front, end, loaders, materials, on, pallets, are, handled, with, forklifts, also, used, for, handling, heavy, items, like, reels, of, paper, steel, or, machinery, are, electric, overhead, cranes, sometimes, called, bridge, cranes, because, they, span, large, factory, bays, mass, production, is, capital, intensive, and, energy, intensive, for, it, uses, a, high, proportion, of, machinery, and, energy, in, relation, to, workers, it, is, also, usually, automated, while, total, expenditure, per, unit, of, product, is, decreased, however, the, machinery, that, is, needed, to, set, up, a, mass, production, line, such, as, robots, and, machine, presses, is, so, expensive, that, in, order, to, attain, profits, there, must, be, some, assurance, that, the, product, will, be, successful, one, of, the, descriptions, of, mass, production, is, that, the, skill, is, built, into, the, tool, which, means, that, the, worker, using, the, tool, may, not, need, the, skill, for, example, in, the, 19th, or, early, 20th, century, this, could, be, expressed, as, the, craftsmanship, is, in, the, workbench, itself, not, the, training, of, the, worker, rather, than, having, a, skilled, worker, measure, every, dimension, of, each, part, of, the, product, against, the, plans, or, the, other, parts, as, it, is, being, formed, there, were, jigs, ready, at, hand, to, ensure, that, the, part, was, made, to, fit, this, set, up, it, had, already, been, checked, that, the, finished, part, would, be, to, specifications, to, fit, all, the, other, finished, parts, and, it, would, be, made, more, quickly, with, no, time, spent, on, finishing, the, parts, to, fit, one, another, later, once, computerized, control, came, about, for, example, cnc, jigs, were, obviated, but, it, remained, true, that, the, skill, or, knowledge, was, built, into, the, tool, or, process, or, documentation, rather, than, residing, in, the, worker, s, head, this, is, the, specialized, capital, required, for, mass, production, each, workbench, and, set, of, tools, or, each, cnc, cell, or, each, fractionating, column, is, different, fine, tuned, to, its, task, standardized, parts, and, sizes, and, factory, production, techniques, were, developed, in, pre, industrial, times, before, the, invention, of, machine, tools, the, manufacture, of, precision, parts, especially, metal, ones, was, highly, labour, intensive, crossbows, made, with, bronze, parts, were, produced, in, china, during, the, warring, states, period, the, qin, emperor, unified, china, at, least, in, part, by, equipping, large, armies, with, these, weapons, which, were, fitted, with, a, sophisticated, trigger, mechanism, made, of, interchangeable, parts, the, terracotta, army, guarding, the, emperor, s, tomb, is, also, believed, to, have, been, created, through, the, use, of, standardized, molds, on, an, assembly, line, in, ancient, carthage, ships, of, war, were, mass, produced, on, a, large, scale, at, a, moderate, cost, allowing, them, to, efficiently, maintain, their, control, of, the, mediterranean, many, centuries, later, the, republic, of, venice, would, follow, carthage, in, producing, ships, with, prefabricated, parts, on, an, assembly, line, the, venetian, arsenal, produced, nearly, one, ship, every, day, in, what, was, effectively, the, world, s, first, factory, which, at, its, height, employed, 16, 000, people, the, invention, of, movable, type, has, allowed, for, documents, such, as, books, to, be, mass, produced, the, first, movable, type, system, was, invented, in, china, by, bi, sheng, during, the, reign, of, the, song, dynasty, where, it, was, used, to, among, other, things, issue, paper, money, the, oldest, extant, book, produced, using, metal, type, is, jikji, printed, in, korea, in, the, year, 1377, johannes, gutenberg, through, his, invention, of, the, printing, press, and, production, of, the, gutenberg, bible, introduced, movable, type, to, europe, through, this, introduction, mass, production, in, the, european, publishing, industry, was, made, commonplace, leading, to, a, democratization, of, knowledge, increased, literacy, and, education, and, the, beginnings, of, modern, science, french, artillery, engineer, jean, baptiste, de, gribeauval, introduced, the, standardization, of, cannon, design, in, the, late, 18th, century, he, streamlined, production, and, management, of, cannonballs, and, cannons, by, limiting, them, to, only, three, calibers, and, he, improved, their, effectiveness, by, requiring, more, spherical, ammunition, redesigning, these, weapons, to, use, interchangeable, wheels, screws, and, axles, simplified, mass, production, and, repair, in, the, industrial, revolution, simple, mass, production, techniques, were, used, at, the, portsmouth, block, mills, in, england, to, make, ships, pulley, blocks, for, the, royal, navy, in, the, napoleonic, wars, it, was, achieved, in, 1803, by, marc, isambard, brunel, in, cooperation, with, henry, maudslay, under, the, management, of, sir, samuel, bentham, the, first, unmistakable, examples, of, manufacturing, operations, carefully, designed, to, reduce, production, costs, by, specialized, labour, and, the, use, of, machines, appeared, in, the, 18th, century, in, england, the, navy, was, in, a, state, of, expansion, that, required, 100, 000, pulley, blocks, to, be, manufactured, a, year, bentham, had, already, achieved, remarkable, efficiency, at, the, docks, by, introducing, power, driven, machinery, and, reorganising, the, dockyard, system, brunel, a, pioneering, engineer, and, maudslay, a, pioneer, of, machine, tool, technology, who, had, developed, the, first, industrially, practical, screw, cutting, lathe, in, 1800, which, standardized, screw, thread, sizes, for, the, first, time, which, in, turn, allowed, the, application, of, interchangeable, parts, collaborated, on, plans, to, manufacture, block, making, machinery, by, 1805, the, dockyard, had, been, fully, updated, with, the, revolutionary, purpose, built, machinery, at, a, time, when, products, were, still, built, individually, with, different, components, a, total, of, 45, machines, were, required, to, perform, 22, processes, on, the, blocks, which, could, be, made, into, one, of, three, possible, sizes, the, machines, were, almost, entirely, made, of, metal, thus, improving, their, accuracy, and, durability, the, machines, would, make, markings, and, indentations, on, the, blocks, to, ensure, alignment, throughout, the, process, one, of, the, many, advantages, of, this, new, method, was, the, increase, in, labour, productivity, due, to, the, less, labour, intensive, requirements, of, managing, the, machinery, richard, beamish, assistant, to, brunel, s, son, and, engineer, isambard, kingdom, brunel, wrote, so, that, ten, men, by, the, aid, of, this, machinery, can, accomplish, with, uniformity, celerity, and, ease, what, formerly, required, the, uncertain, labour, of, one, hundred, and, ten, by, 1808, annual, production, from, the, 45, machines, had, reached, 130, 000, blocks, and, some, of, the, equipment, was, still, in, operation, as, late, as, the, mid, twentieth, century, mass, production, techniques, were, also, used, to, rather, limited, extent, to, make, clocks, and, watches, and, to, make, small, arms, though, parts, were, usually, non, interchangeable, though, produced, on, a, very, small, scale, crimean, war, gunboat, engines, designed, and, assembled, by, john, penn, of, greenwich, are, recorded, as, the, first, instance, of, the, application, of, mass, production, techniques, though, not, necessarily, the, assembly, line, method, to, marine, engineering, in, filling, an, admiralty, order, for, 90, sets, to, his, high, pressure, and, high, revolution, horizontal, trunk, engine, design, penn, produced, them, all, in, 90, days, he, also, used, whitworth, standard, threads, throughout, prerequisites, for, the, wide, use, of, mass, production, were, interchangeable, parts, machine, tools, and, power, especially, in, the, form, of, electricity, some, of, the, organizational, management, concepts, needed, to, create, 20th, century, mass, production, such, as, scientific, management, had, been, pioneered, by, other, engineers, most, of, whom, are, not, famous, but, frederick, winslow, taylor, is, one, of, the, well, known, ones, whose, work, would, later, be, synthesized, into, fields, such, as, industrial, engineering, manufacturing, engineering, operations, research, and, management, consultancy, although, after, leaving, the, henry, ford, company, which, was, rebranded, as, cadillac, and, later, was, awarded, the, dewar, trophy, in, 1908, for, creating, interchangeable, mass, produced, precision, engine, parts, henry, ford, downplayed, the, role, of, taylorism, in, the, development, of, mass, production, at, his, company, however, ford, management, performed, time, studies, and, experiments, to, mechanize, their, factory, processes, focusing, on, minimizing, worker, movements, the, difference, is, that, while, taylor, focused, mostly, on, efficiency, of, the, worker, ford, also, substituted, for, labor, by, using, machines, thoughtfully, arranged, wherever, possible, in, 1807, eli, terry, was, hired, to, produce, 4, 000, wooden, movement, clocks, in, the, porter, contract, at, this, time, the, annual, yield, for, wooden, clocks, did, not, exceed, a, few, dozen, on, average, terry, developed, a, milling, machine, in, 1795, in, which, he, perfected, interchangeable, parts, in, 1807, terry, developed, a, spindle, cutting, machine, which, could, produce, multiple, parts, at, the, same, time, terry, hired, silas, hoadley, and, seth, thomas, to, work, the, assembly, line, at, the, facilities, the, porter, contract, was, the, first, contract, which, called, for, mass, production, of, clock, movements, in, history, in, 1815, terry, began, mass, producing, the, first, shelf, clock, chauncey, jerome, an, apprentice, of, eli, terry, mass, produced, up, to, 20, 000, brass, clocks, annually, in, 1840, when, he, invented, the, cheap, 30, hour, og, clock, the, united, states, department, of, war, sponsored, the, development, of, interchangeable, parts, for, guns, produced, at, the, arsenals, at, springfield, massachusetts, and, harpers, ferry, virginia, now, west, virginia, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 19th, century, finally, achieving, reliable, interchangeability, by, about, 1850, this, period, coincided, with, the, development, of, machine, tools, with, the, armories, designing, and, building, many, of, their, own, some, of, the, methods, employed, were, a, system, of, gauges, for, checking, dimensions, of, the, various, parts, and, jigs, and, fixtures, for, guiding, the, machine, tools, and, properly, holding, and, aligning, the, work, pieces, this, system, came, to, be, known, as, armory, practice, or, the, american, system, of, manufacturing, which, spread, throughout, new, england, aided, by, skilled, mechanics, from, the, armories, who, were, instrumental, in, transferring, the, technology, to, the, sewing, machines, manufacturers, and, other, industries, such, as, machine, tools, harvesting, machines, and, bicycles, singer, manufacturing, co, at, one, time, the, largest, sewing, machine, manufacturer, did, not, achieve, interchangeable, parts, until, the, late, 1880s, around, the, same, time, cyrus, mccormick, adopted, modern, manufacturing, practices, in, making, harvesting, machines, during, world, war, ii, the, united, states, mass, produced, many, vehicles, and, weapons, such, as, ships, i, e, liberty, ships, higgins, boats, aircraft, i, e, north, american, p, 51, mustang, consolidated, b, 24, liberator, boeing, b, 29, superfortress, jeeps, i, e, willys, mb, trucks, tanks, i, e, m4, sherman, and, m2, browning, and, m1919, browning, machine, guns, many, vehicles, transported, by, ships, have, been, shipped, in, parts, and, later, assembled, on, site, for, the, ongoing, energy, transition, many, wind, turbine, components, and, solar, panels, are, being, mass, produced, wind, turbines, and, solar, panels, are, being, used, in, respectively, wind, farms, and, solar, farms, in, addition, in, the, ongoing, climate, change, mitigation, large, scale, carbon, sequestration, through, reforestation, blue, carbon, restoration, etc, has, been, proposed, some, projects, such, as, the, trillion, tree, campaign, involve, planting, a, very, large, amount, of, trees, in, order, to, speed, up, such, efforts, fast, propagation, of, trees, may, be, useful, some, automated, machines, have, been, produced, to, allow, for, fast, vegetative, plant, propagation, also, for, some, plants, that, help, to, sequester, carbon, such, as, seagrass, techniques, have, been, developed, to, help, speed, up, the, process, mass, production, benefited, from, the, development, of, materials, such, as, inexpensive, steel, high, strength, steel, and, plastics, machining, of, metals, was, greatly, enhanced, with, high, speed, steel, and, later, very, hard, materials, such, as, tungsten, carbide, for, cutting, edges, fabrication, using, steel, components, was, aided, by, the, development, of, electric, welding, and, stamped, steel, parts, both, which, appeared, in, industry, in, about, 1890, plastics, such, as, polyethylene, polystyrene, and, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, can, be, easily, formed, into, shapes, by, extrusion, blow, molding, or, injection, molding, resulting, in, very, low, cost, manufacture, of, consumer, products, plastic, piping, containers, and, parts, an, influential, article, that, helped, to, frame, and, popularize, the, 20th, century, s, definition, of, mass, production, appeared, in, a, 1926, encyclop, dia, britannica, supplement, the, article, was, written, based, on, correspondence, with, ford, motor, company, and, is, sometimes, credited, as, the, first, use, of, the, term, electrification, of, factories, began, very, gradually, in, the, 1890s, after, the, introduction, of, a, practical, dc, motor, by, frank, j, sprague, and, accelerated, after, the, ac, motor, was, developed, by, galileo, ferraris, nikola, tesla, and, westinghouse, mikhail, dolivo, dobrovolsky, and, others, electrification, of, factories, was, fastest, between, 1900, and, 1930, aided, by, the, establishment, of, electric, utilities, with, central, stations, and, the, lowering, of, electricity, prices, from, 1914, to, 1917, electric, motors, were, several, times, more, efficient, than, small, steam, engines, because, central, station, generation, were, more, efficient, than, small, steam, engines, and, because, line, shafts, and, belts, had, high, friction, losses, electric, motors, also, allowed, more, flexibility, in, manufacturing, and, required, less, maintenance, than, line, shafts, and, belts, many, factories, saw, a, 30, increase, in, output, simply, from, changing, over, to, electric, motors, electrification, enabled, modern, mass, production, as, with, thomas, edison, s, iron, ore, processing, plant, about, 1893, that, could, process, 20, 000, tons, of, ore, per, day, with, two, shifts, each, of, five, men, at, that, time, it, was, still, common, to, handle, bulk, materials, with, shovels, wheelbarrows, and, small, narrow, gauge, rail, cars, and, for, comparison, a, canal, digger, in, previous, decades, typically, handled, five, tons, per, 12, hour, day, the, biggest, impact, of, early, mass, production, was, in, manufacturing, everyday, items, such, as, at, the, ball, brothers, glass, manufacturing, company, which, electrified, its, mason, jar, plant, in, muncie, indiana, u, s, around, 1900, the, new, automated, process, used, glass, blowing, machines, to, replace, 210, craftsman, glass, blowers, and, helpers, a, small, electric, truck, was, used, to, handle, 150, dozen, bottles, at, a, time, where, previously, a, hand, truck, would, carry, six, dozen, electric, mixers, replaced, men, with, shovels, handling, sand, and, other, ingredients, that, were, fed, into, the, glass, furnace, an, electric, overhead, crane, replaced, 36, day, laborers, for, moving, heavy, loads, across, the, factory, according, to, henry, ford, the, provision, of, a, whole, new, system, of, electric, generation, emancipated, industry, from, the, leather, belt, and, line, shaft, for, it, eventually, became, possible, to, provide, each, tool, with, its, own, electric, motor, this, may, seem, only, a, detail, of, minor, importance, in, fact, modern, industry, could, not, be, carried, out, with, the, belt, and, line, shaft, for, a, number, of, reasons, the, motor, enabled, machinery, to, be, arranged, in, the, order, of, the, work, and, that, alone, has, probably, doubled, the, efficiency, of, industry, for, it, has, cut, out, a, tremendous, amount, of, useless, handling, and, hauling, the, belt, and, line, shaft, were, also, tremendously, wasteful, so, wasteful, indeed, that, no, factory, could, be, really, large, for, even, the, longest, line, shaft, was, small, according, to, modern, requirements, also, high, speed, tools, were, impossible, under, the, old, conditions, neither, the, pulleys, nor, the, belts, could, stand, modern, speeds, without, high, speed, tools, and, the, finer, steels, which, they, brought, about, there, could, be, nothing, of, what, we, call, modern, industry, mass, production, was, popularized, in, the, late, 1910s, and, 1920s, by, henry, ford, s, ford, motor, company, which, introduced, electric, motors, to, the, then, well, known, technique, of, chain, or, sequential, production, ford, also, bought, or, designed, and, built, special, purpose, machine, tools, and, fixtures, such, as, multiple, spindle, drill, presses, that, could, drill, every, hole, on, one, side, of, an, engine, block, in, one, operation, and, a, multiple, head, milling, machine, that, could, simultaneously, machine, 15, engine, blocks, held, on, a, single, fixture, all, of, these, machine, tools, were, arranged, systematically, in, the, production, flow, and, some, had, special, carriages, for, rolling, heavy, items, into, machining, position, production, of, the, ford, model, t, used, 32, 000, machine, tools, the, process, of, prefabrication, wherein, parts, are, created, separately, from, the, finished, product, is, at, the, core, of, all, mass, produced, construction, early, examples, include, movable, structures, reportedly, utilized, by, akbar, the, great, and, the, chattel, houses, built, by, emancipated, slaves, on, barbados, the, nissen, hut, first, used, by, the, british, during, world, war, i, married, prefabrication, and, mass, production, in, a, way, that, suited, the, needs, of, the, military, the, simple, structures, which, cost, little, and, could, be, erected, in, just, a, couple, of, hours, were, highly, successful, over, 100, 000, nissen, huts, were, produced, during, world, war, i, alone, and, they, would, go, on, to, serve, in, other, conflicts, and, inspire, a, number, of, similar, designs, following, world, war, ii, in, the, united, states, william, levitt, pioneered, the, building, of, standardized, tract, houses, in, 56, different, locations, around, the, country, these, communities, were, dubbed, levittowns, and, they, were, able, to, be, constructed, quickly, and, cheaply, through, the, leveraging, of, economies, of, scale, as, well, as, the, specialization, of, construction, tasks, in, a, process, akin, to, an, assembly, line, this, era, also, saw, the, invention, of, the, mobile, home, a, small, prefabricated, house, that, can, be, transported, cheaply, on, a, truck, bed, in, the, modern, industrialization, of, construction, mass, production, is, often, used, for, prefabrication, of, house, components, fabrics, and, materials, mass, production, has, significantly, impacted, the, fashion, industry, particularly, in, the, realm, of, fibers, and, materials, the, advent, of, synthetic, fibers, such, as, polyester, and, nylon, revolutionized, textile, manufacturing, by, providing, cost, effective, alternatives, to, natural, fibers, this, shift, enabled, the, rapid, production, of, inexpensive, clothing, contributing, to, the, rise, of, fast, fashion, this, reliance, on, mass, production, has, raised, concerns, about, environmental, sustainability, and, labor, conditions, spurring, the, need, for, greater, ethical, and, sustainable, practices, within, the, fashion, industry, mass, production, systems, for, items, made, of, numerous, parts, are, usually, organized, into, assembly, lines, the, assemblies, pass, by, on, a, conveyor, or, if, they, are, heavy, hung, from, an, overhead, crane, or, monorail, in, a, factory, for, a, complex, product, rather, than, one, assembly, line, there, may, be, many, auxiliary, assembly, lines, feeding, sub, assemblies, i, e, car, engines, or, seats, to, a, backbone, main, assembly, line, a, diagram, of, a, typical, mass, production, factory, looks, more, like, the, skeleton, of, a, fish, than, a, single, line, vertical, integration, is, a, business, practice, that, involves, gaining, complete, control, over, a, product, s, production, from, raw, materials, to, final, assembly, in, the, age, of, mass, production, this, caused, shipping, and, trade, problems, in, that, shipping, systems, were, unable, to, transport, huge, volumes, of, finished, automobiles, in, henry, ford, s, case, without, causing, damage, and, also, government, policies, imposed, trade, barriers, on, finished, units, ford, built, the, ford, river, rouge, complex, with, the, idea, of, making, the, company, s, own, iron, and, steel, in, the, same, large, factory, site, where, parts, and, car, assembly, took, place, river, rouge, also, generated, its, own, electricity, upstream, vertical, integration, such, as, to, raw, materials, is, away, from, leading, technology, toward, mature, low, return, industries, most, companies, chose, to, focus, on, their, core, business, rather, than, vertical, integration, this, included, buying, parts, from, outside, suppliers, who, could, often, produce, them, as, cheaply, or, cheaper, standard, oil, the, major, oil, company, in, the, 19th, century, was, vertically, integrated, partly, because, there, was, no, demand, for, unrefined, crude, oil, but, kerosene, and, some, other, products, were, in, great, demand, the, other, reason, was, that, standard, oil, monopolized, the, oil, industry, the, major, oil, companies, were, and, many, still, are, vertically, integrated, from, production, to, refining, and, with, their, own, retail, stations, although, some, sold, off, their, retail, operations, some, oil, companies, also, have, chemical, divisions, lumber, and, paper, companies, at, one, time, owned, most, of, their, timber, lands, and, sold, some, finished, products, such, as, corrugated, boxes, the, tendency, has, been, to, divest, of, timber, lands, to, raise, cash, and, to, avoid, property, taxes, the, economies, of, mass, production, come, from, several, sources, the, primary, cause, is, a, reduction, of, non, productive, effort, of, all, types, in, craft, production, the, craftsman, must, bustle, about, a, shop, getting, parts, and, assembling, them, he, must, locate, and, use, many, tools, many, times, for, varying, tasks, in, mass, production, each, worker, repeats, one, or, a, few, related, tasks, that, use, the, same, tool, to, perform, identical, or, near, identical, operations, on, a, stream, of, products, the, exact, tool, and, parts, are, always, at, hand, having, been, moved, down, the, assembly, line, consecutively, the, worker, spends, little, or, no, time, retrieving, and, or, preparing, materials, and, tools, and, so, the, time, taken, to, manufacture, a, product, using, mass, production, is, shorter, than, when, using, traditional, methods, the, probability, of, human, error, and, variation, is, also, reduced, as, tasks, are, predominantly, carried, out, by, machinery, error, in, operating, such, machinery, has, more, far, reaching, consequences, a, reduction, in, labour, costs, as, well, as, an, increased, rate, of, production, enables, a, company, to, produce, a, larger, quantity, of, one, product, at, a, lower, cost, than, using, traditional, non, linear, methods, however, mass, production, is, inflexible, because, it, is, difficult, to, alter, a, design, or, production, process, after, a, production, line, is, implemented, also, all, products, produced, on, one, production, line, will, be, identical, or, very, similar, and, introducing, variety, to, satisfy, individual, tastes, is, not, easy, however, some, variety, can, be, achieved, by, applying, different, finishes, and, decorations, at, the, end, of, the, production, line, if, necessary, the, starter, cost, for, the, machinery, can, be, expensive, so, the, producer, must, be, sure, it, sells, or, the, producers, will, lose, a, lot, of, money, the, ford, model, t, produced, tremendous, affordable, output, but, was, not, very, good, at, responding, to, demand, for, variety, customization, or, design, changes, as, a, consequence, ford, eventually, lost, market, share, to, general, motors, who, introduced, annual, model, changes, more, accessories, and, a, choice, of, colors, with, each, passing, decade, engineers, have, found, ways, to, increase, the, flexibility, of, mass, production, systems, driving, down, the, lead, times, on, new, product, development, and, allowing, greater, customization, and, variety, of, products, compared, with, other, production, methods, mass, production, can, create, new, occupational, hazards, for, workers, this, is, partly, due, to, the, need, for, workers, to, operate, heavy, machinery, while, also, working, close, together, with, many, other, workers, preventative, safety, measures, such, as, fire, drills, as, well, as, special, training, is, therefore, necessary, to, minimise, the, occurrence, of, industrial, accidents, in, the, 1830s, french, political, thinker, and, historian, alexis, de, tocqueville, identified, one, of, the, key, characteristics, of, america, that, would, later, make, it, so, amenable, to, the, development, of, mass, production, the, homogeneous, consumer, base, de, tocqueville, wrote, in, his, democracy, in, america, 1835, that, the, absence, in, the, united, states, of, those, vast, accumulations, of, wealth, which, favor, the, expenditures, of, large, sums, on, articles, of, mere, luxury, impact, to, the, productions, of, american, industry, a, character, distinct, from, that, of, other, countries, industries, articles, suited, to, the, wants, of, the, whole, people, mass, production, improved, productivity, which, was, a, contributing, factor, to, economic, growth, and, the, decline, in, work, week, hours, alongside, other, factors, such, as, transportation, infrastructures, canals, railroads, and, highways, and, agricultural, mechanization, these, factors, caused, the, typical, work, week, to, decline, from, 70, hours, in, the, early, 19th, century, to, 60, hours, late, in, the, century, then, to, 50, hours, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, finally, to, 40, hours, in, the, mid, 1930s, mass, production, permitted, great, increases, in, total, production, using, a, european, crafts, system, into, the, late, 19th, century, it, was, difficult, to, meet, demand, for, products, such, as, sewing, machines, and, animal, powered, mechanical, harvesters, by, the, late, 1920s, many, previously, scarce, goods, were, in, good, supply, one, economist, has, argued, that, this, constituted, overproduction, and, contributed, to, high, unemployment, during, the, great, depression, say, s, law, denies, the, possibility, of, general, overproduction, and, for, this, reason, classical, economists, deny, that, it, had, any, role, in, the, great, depression, mass, production, allowed, the, evolution, of, consumerism, by, lowering, the, unit, cost, of, many, goods, used, mass, production, has, been, linked, to, the, fast, fashion, industry, often, leaving, the, consumer, with, lower, quality, garments, for, a, lower, cost, most, fast, fashion, clothing, is, mass, produced, which, means, it, is, typically, made, of, cheap, fabrics, such, as, polyester, and, constructed, poorly, in, order, to, keep, short, turnaround, times, to, meet, the, demands, of, consumers, and, shifting, trends, from, old, price, tables, it, can, be, deduced, that, the, capacity, of, a, printing, press, around, 1600, assuming, a, fifteen, hour, workday, was, between, 3, 200, and, 3, 600, impressions, per, day
