a, circuit, breaker, is, an, electrical, safety, device, designed, to, protect, an, electrical, circuit, from, damage, caused, by, current, in, excess, of, that, which, the, equipment, can, safely, carry, overcurrent, its, basic, function, is, to, interrupt, current, flow, to, protect, equipment, and, to, prevent, fire, unlike, a, fuse, which, operates, once, and, then, must, be, replaced, a, circuit, breaker, can, be, reset, either, manually, or, automatically, to, resume, normal, operation, circuit, breakers, are, commonly, installed, in, distribution, boards, apart, from, its, safety, purpose, a, circuit, breaker, is, also, often, used, as, a, main, switch, to, manually, disconnect, rack, out, and, connect, rack, in, electrical, power, to, a, whole, electrical, sub, network, circuit, breakers, are, made, in, varying, current, ratings, from, devices, that, protect, low, current, circuits, or, individual, household, appliances, to, switchgear, designed, to, protect, high, voltage, circuits, feeding, an, entire, city, any, device, which, protects, against, excessive, current, by, automatically, removing, power, from, a, faulty, system, such, as, a, circuit, breaker, or, fuse, can, be, referred, to, as, an, over, current, protection, device, ocpd, an, early, form, of, circuit, breaker, was, described, by, thomas, edison, in, an, 1879, patent, application, although, his, commercial, power, distribution, system, used, fuses, its, purpose, was, to, protect, lighting, circuit, wiring, from, accidental, short, circuits, and, overloads, a, modern, miniature, circuit, breaker, similar, to, the, ones, now, in, use, was, patented, by, brown, boveri, cie, in, 1924, hugo, stotz, an, engineer, who, had, sold, his, company, to, brown, boveri, cie, was, credited, as, the, inventor, on, german, patent, 458392, stotz, s, invention, was, the, forerunner, of, the, modern, thermal, magnetic, breaker, commonly, used, in, household, load, centers, to, this, day, interconnection, of, multiple, generator, sources, into, an, electrical, grid, required, the, development, of, circuit, breakers, with, increasing, voltage, ratings, and, increased, ability, to, safely, interrupt, the, increasing, short, circuit, currents, produced, by, networks, simple, air, break, manual, switches, produced, hazardous, arcs, when, interrupting, high, voltage, circuits, these, gave, way, to, oil, enclosed, contacts, and, various, forms, using, the, directed, flow, of, pressurized, air, or, pressurized, oil, to, cool, and, interrupt, the, arc, by, 1935, the, specially, constructed, circuit, breakers, used, at, the, boulder, dam, project, used, eight, series, breaks, and, pressurized, oil, flow, to, interrupt, faults, of, up, to, 2, 500, mva, in, three, ac, cycles, all, circuit, breaker, systems, have, common, features, in, their, operation, but, details, vary, substantially, depending, on, the, voltage, class, current, rating, and, type, of, the, circuit, breaker, the, circuit, breaker, must, first, detect, a, fault, condition, in, small, mains, and, low, voltage, circuit, breakers, this, is, usually, done, within, the, device, itself, typically, the, heating, or, magnetic, effects, of, electric, current, are, employed, circuit, breakers, for, large, currents, or, high, voltages, are, usually, arranged, with, protective, relay, pilot, devices, to, sense, a, fault, condition, and, to, operate, the, opening, mechanism, these, typically, require, a, separate, power, source, such, as, a, battery, although, some, high, voltage, circuit, breakers, are, self, contained, with, current, transformers, protective, relays, and, internal, power, sources, once, a, fault, is, detected, the, circuit, breaker, contacts, must, open, to, interrupt, the, circuit, this, is, commonly, done, using, mechanically, stored, energy, contained, within, the, breaker, such, as, a, spring, or, compressed, air, to, separate, the, contacts, a, breaker, may, also, use, the, higher, current, caused, by, the, fault, to, separate, the, contacts, via, thermal, expansion, or, increased, magnetic, field, a, small, circuit, breakers, typically, has, a, manual, control, lever, to, switch, the, circuit, off, or, reset, a, tripped, breaker, while, a, larger, unit, may, use, a, solenoid, to, trip, the, mechanism, and, an, electric, motor, to, restore, energy, to, springs, which, rapidly, separate, contacts, when, the, breaker, is, tripped, the, circuit, breaker, contacts, must, carry, the, load, current, without, excessive, heating, and, must, also, withstand, the, heat, of, the, arc, produced, when, interrupting, opening, the, circuit, contacts, are, made, of, copper, or, copper, alloys, silver, alloys, and, other, highly, conductive, materials, service, life, of, the, contacts, is, limited, by, the, erosion, of, contact, material, due, to, arcing, while, interrupting, the, current, miniature, and, molded, case, circuit, breakers, are, usually, discarded, when, the, contacts, have, worn, but, power, circuit, breakers, and, high, voltage, circuit, breakers, have, replaceable, contacts, when, a, high, current, or, voltage, is, interrupted, an, arc, is, generated, the, maximum, length, of, the, arc, is, generally, proportional, to, the, voltage, while, the, intensity, or, heat, is, proportional, to, the, current, this, arc, must, be, contained, cooled, and, extinguished, in, a, controlled, way, so, that, the, gap, between, the, contacts, can, again, withstand, the, voltage, in, the, circuit, different, circuit, breakers, use, vacuum, air, insulating, gas, or, oil, as, the, medium, the, arc, forms, in, different, techniques, are, used, to, extinguish, the, arc, including, finally, once, the, fault, condition, has, been, cleared, the, contacts, must, again, be, closed, to, restore, power, to, the, interrupted, circuit, low, voltage, miniature, circuit, breakers, mcb, use, air, alone, to, extinguish, the, arc, these, circuit, breakers, contain, so, called, arc, chutes, a, stack, of, mutually, insulated, parallel, metal, plates, that, divide, and, cool, the, arc, by, splitting, the, arc, into, smaller, arcs, the, arc, is, cooled, down, while, the, arc, voltage, is, increased, and, serves, as, an, additional, impedance, that, limits, the, current, through, the, circuit, breaker, the, current, carrying, parts, near, the, contacts, provide, easy, deflection, of, the, arc, into, the, arc, chutes, by, a, magnetic, force, of, a, current, path, although, magnetic, blowout, coils, or, permanent, magnets, could, also, deflect, the, arc, into, the, arc, chute, used, on, circuit, breakers, for, higher, ratings, the, number, of, plates, in, the, arc, chute, is, dependent, on, the, short, circuit, rating, and, nominal, voltage, of, the, circuit, breaker, in, larger, ratings, oil, circuit, breakers, rely, upon, vaporization, of, some, of, the, oil, to, blast, a, jet, of, oil, through, the, arc, gas, usually, sulfur, hexafluoride, circuit, breakers, sometimes, stretch, the, arc, using, a, magnetic, field, and, then, rely, upon, the, dielectric, strength, of, the, sulfur, hexafluoride, sf, 6, to, quench, the, stretched, arc, vacuum, circuit, breakers, have, minimal, arcing, as, there, is, nothing, to, ionize, other, than, the, contact, material, the, arc, is, quenched, when, it, is, stretched, a, very, small, amount, less, than, 3, mm, 0, 1, in, vacuum, circuit, breakers, are, frequently, used, in, modern, medium, voltage, switch, gear, to, 38, 000, volts, air, circuit, breakers, may, use, compressed, air, to, blow, out, the, arc, or, alternatively, the, contacts, are, rapidly, swung, into, a, small, sealed, chamber, the, escaping, of, the, displaced, air, thus, blowing, out, the, arc, circuit, breakers, are, usually, able, to, terminate, all, current, very, quickly, typically, the, arc, is, extinguished, between, 30, ms, and, 150, ms, after, the, mechanism, has, been, tripped, depending, upon, age, and, construction, of, the, device, the, maximum, current, value, and, let, through, energy, determine, the, quality, of, the, circuit, breakers, circuit, breakers, are, rated, both, by, the, normal, current, that, they, are, expected, to, carry, and, the, maximum, short, circuit, current, that, they, can, safely, interrupt, this, latter, figure, is, the, ampere, interrupting, capacity, aic, of, the, breaker, under, short, circuit, conditions, the, calculated, or, measured, maximum, prospective, short, circuit, current, may, be, many, times, the, normal, rated, current, of, the, circuit, when, electrical, contacts, open, to, interrupt, a, large, current, there, is, a, tendency, for, an, arc, to, form, between, the, opened, contacts, which, would, allow, the, current, to, continue, this, condition, can, create, conductive, ionized, gases, and, molten, or, vaporized, metal, which, can, cause, the, further, continuation, of, the, arc, or, create, additional, short, circuits, potentially, resulting, in, the, explosion, of, the, circuit, breaker, and, the, equipment, that, it, is, installed, in, therefore, circuit, breakers, incorporate, various, features, to, divide, and, extinguish, the, arcs, the, maximum, short, circuit, current, that, a, breaker, can, interrupt, is, determined, by, testing, application, of, a, breaker, in, a, circuit, with, a, prospective, short, circuit, current, higher, than, the, breaker, s, interrupting, capacity, rating, may, result, in, failure, of, the, breaker, to, safely, interrupt, a, fault, in, a, worst, case, scenario, a, breaker, may, successfully, interrupt, a, fault, only, to, explode, when, reset, typical, domestic, panel, circuit, breakers, are, rated, to, interrupt, 6, ka, 6000, a, short, circuit, current, miniature, circuit, breakers, used, to, protect, control, circuits, or, small, appliances, may, not, have, sufficient, interrupting, capacity, to, use, at, a, panel, board, these, circuit, breakers, are, called, supplemental, circuit, protectors, to, distinguish, them, from, distribution, type, circuit, breakers, circuit, breakers, are, manufactured, with, standard, ratings, using, a, system, of, preferred, numbers, to, create, a, useful, selection, of, ratings, a, miniature, circuit, breaker, has, a, fixed, trip, setting, changing, the, operating, current, value, requires, replacing, the, whole, circuit, breaker, circuit, breakers, with, higher, ratings, can, have, adjustable, trip, settings, allowing, fewer, standardized, products, to, be, used, adjusted, to, the, applicable, precise, ratings, when, installed, for, example, a, circuit, breaker, with, a, 400, ampere, frame, size, might, have, its, over, current, detection, threshold, set, only, 300, amperes, where, that, rating, is, appropriate, for, low, voltage, distribution, circuit, breakers, an, international, standard, iec, 60898, 1, defines, rated, current, as, the, maximum, current, that, a, breaker, is, designed, to, carry, continuously, the, commonly, available, preferred, values, for, rated, current, are, 1, a, 2, a, 4, a, 6, a, 10, a, 13, a, 16, a, 20, a, 25, a, 32, a, 40, a, 50, a, 63, a, 80, a, 100, a, and, 125, a, the, circuit, breaker, is, labeled, with, the, rated, current, in, amperes, prefixed, by, a, letter, which, indicates, the, instantaneous, tripping, current, that, causes, the, circuit, breaker, to, trip, without, intentional, time, delay, expressed, in, multiples, of, the, rated, current, for, the, protection, of, loads, that, cause, frequent, short, duration, approximately, 400, ms, to, 2, s, current, peaks, in, normal, operation, for, the, protection, of, loads, such, as, semiconductor, devices, or, measuring, circuits, using, current, transformers, circuit, breakers, are, also, rated, by, the, maximum, fault, current, that, they, can, interrupt, this, allows, use, of, more, economical, devices, on, systems, unlikely, to, develop, the, high, short, circuit, current, found, on, for, example, a, large, commercial, building, distribution, system, in, the, united, states, underwriters, laboratories, ul, certifies, equipment, ratings, called, series, ratings, or, integrated, equipment, ratings, for, circuit, breaker, equipment, used, for, buildings, power, circuit, breakers, and, medium, and, high, voltage, circuit, breakers, used, for, industrial, or, electric, power, systems, are, designed, and, tested, to, ansi, or, ieee, standards, in, the, c37, series, for, example, standard, c37, 16, lists, preferred, frame, size, current, ratings, for, power, circuit, breakers, in, the, range, of, 600, to, 5000, amperes, trip, current, settings, and, time, current, characteristics, of, these, breakers, are, generally, adjustable, for, medium, and, high, voltage, circuit, breakers, used, in, switchgear, substations, and, generating, stations, relatively, few, standard, frame, sizes, are, generally, manufactured, these, circuit, breakers, are, usually, controlled, by, separate, protective, relay, systems, offering, adjustable, tripping, current, and, time, settings, as, well, as, allowing, for, more, complex, protection, schemes, many, classifications, of, circuit, breakers, can, be, made, based, on, their, features, such, as, voltage, class, construction, type, interrupting, type, and, structural, features, low, voltage, less, than, 1, 000, v, ac, types, are, common, in, domestic, commercial, and, industrial, application, and, include, the, characteristics, of, low, voltage, circuit, breakers, are, given, by, international, standards, such, as, iec, 947, these, circuit, breakers, are, often, installed, in, draw, out, enclosures, that, allow, removal, and, interchange, without, dismantling, the, switchgear, large, low, voltage, molded, case, and, power, circuit, breakers, may, have, electric, motor, operators, so, they, can, open, and, close, under, remote, control, these, may, form, part, of, an, automatic, transfer, switch, system, for, standby, power, low, voltage, circuit, breakers, are, also, made, for, direct, current, dc, applications, such, as, for, subway, lines, direct, current, requires, special, breakers, because, the, arc, is, continuous, unlike, an, ac, arc, which, tends, to, go, out, on, each, half, cycle, a, direct, current, circuit, breaker, has, a, blow, out, coil, that, generates, a, magnetic, field, that, rapidly, stretches, the, arc, small, circuit, breakers, are, either, installed, directly, in, equipment, or, arranged, in, breaker, panels, the, din, rail, mounted, thermal, magnetic, miniature, circuit, breaker, is, the, most, common, style, in, modern, domestic, consumer, units, and, commercial, electrical, distribution, boards, throughout, europe, the, design, includes, the, following, components, solid, state, circuit, breakers, sscbs, also, known, as, digital, circuit, breakers, are, a, technological, innovation, which, promises, to, advance, circuit, breaker, technology, out, of, the, mechanical, level, into, the, electrical, this, promises, several, advantages, such, as, acting, much, more, quickly, breaking, circuits, in, fractions, of, microseconds, better, monitoring, of, circuit, loads, and, longer, lifetimes, solid, state, circuit, breakers, have, been, developed, for, medium, voltage, dc, power, and, can, use, silicon, carbide, transistors, or, integrated, gate, commutated, thyristors, igcts, for, switching, a, magnetic, circuit, breaker, uses, a, solenoid, electromagnet, whose, pulling, force, increases, with, the, current, certain, designs, utilize, electromagnetic, forces, in, addition, to, those, of, the, solenoid, the, circuit, breaker, contacts, are, held, closed, by, a, latch, as, the, current, in, the, solenoid, increases, beyond, the, rating, of, the, circuit, breaker, the, solenoid, s, pull, releases, the, latch, which, lets, the, contacts, open, by, spring, action, they, are, the, most, commonly, used, circuit, breakers, in, the, united, states, a, thermal, magnetic, circuit, breaker, which, is, the, type, found, in, most, distribution, boards, in, europe, and, countries, with, a, similar, wiring, arrangement, incorporates, both, techniques, with, the, electromagnet, responding, instantaneously, to, large, surges, in, current, such, as, short, circuits, and, the, bimetallic, strip, responding, to, lesser, but, longer, term, over, current, conditions, the, thermal, portion, of, the, circuit, breaker, provides, a, time, response, feature, that, trips, the, circuit, breaker, sooner, for, larger, over, currents, but, allows, smaller, overloads, to, persist, for, a, longer, time, this, allows, short, current, spikes, such, as, are, produced, when, a, motor, or, other, non, resistive, load, is, switched, on, with, a, very, large, over, current, such, as, may, be, caused, short, circuit, the, magnetic, element, trips, the, circuit, breaker, with, no, intentional, additional, delay, a, magnetic, hydraulic, circuit, breaker, uses, a, solenoid, coil, to, provide, operating, force, to, open, the, contacts, a, magnetic, hydraulic, breaker, incorporates, a, hydraulic, time, delay, feature, using, a, viscous, fluid, a, spring, restrains, the, core, until, the, current, exceeds, the, breaker, rating, during, an, overload, the, speed, of, the, solenoid, motion, is, restricted, by, the, fluid, the, delay, permits, brief, current, surges, beyond, normal, running, current, for, motor, starting, energizing, equipment, etc, short, circuit, currents, provide, sufficient, solenoid, force, to, release, the, latch, regardless, of, core, position, thus, bypassing, the, delay, feature, ambient, temperature, affects, the, time, delay, but, does, not, affect, the, current, rating, of, a, magnetic, breaker, a, large, power, circuit, breaker, such, as, one, applied, in, circuits, of, more, than, 1000, volts, may, incorporate, hydraulic, elements, in, the, contact, operating, mechanism, hydraulic, energy, may, be, supplied, by, a, pump, or, stored, in, accumulators, these, form, a, distinct, type, from, oil, filled, circuit, breakers, where, oil, is, the, arc, extinguishing, medium, to, provide, simultaneous, breaking, on, multiple, circuits, from, a, fault, on, any, one, circuit, breakers, may, be, made, as, a, ganged, assembly, this, is, a, very, common, requirement, for, three, phase, systems, where, breaking, may, be, either, three, or, four, pole, solid, or, switched, neutral, some, makers, make, ganging, kits, to, allow, groups, of, single, phase, breakers, to, be, interlinked, as, required, in, the, us, where, split, phase, supplies, are, common, in, a, branch, circuit, with, more, than, one, live, conductor, each, live, conductor, must, be, protected, by, a, breaker, pole, to, ensure, that, all, live, conductors, are, interrupted, when, any, pole, trips, a, common, trip, set, of, breakers, must, be, used, these, may, either, contain, two, or, three, tripping, mechanisms, within, one, case, or, for, small, breakers, have, the, breakers, externally, tied, together, via, their, operating, handles, two, pole, common, trip, breakers, are, common, on, 120, 240, volt, systems, where, 240, volt, loads, including, major, appliances, or, further, distribution, boards, span, the, two, live, wires, three, pole, common, trip, breakers, are, typically, used, to, supply, three, phase, power, to, powerful, motors, or, further, distribution, boards, separate, circuit, breakers, must, never, be, used, for, live, and, neutral, because, if, the, neutral, is, disconnected, while, the, live, conductor, stays, connected, a, very, dangerous, condition, arises, the, circuit, appears, de, energized, appliances, don, t, work, but, wires, remain, live, and, some, residual, current, devices, rcds, may, not, trip, if, someone, touches, the, live, wire, because, some, rcds, need, power, to, trip, this, is, why, only, common, trip, breakers, must, be, used, when, neutral, wire, switching, is, needed, a, shunt, trip, unit, appears, similar, to, a, normal, breaker, and, the, moving, actuators, are, ganged, to, a, normal, breaker, mechanism, to, operate, together, in, a, similar, way, but, the, shunt, trip, is, a, solenoid, intended, to, be, operated, by, an, external, constant, voltage, signal, rather, than, a, current, commonly, the, local, mains, voltage, or, dc, these, are, often, used, to, cut, the, power, when, a, high, risk, event, occurs, such, as, a, fire, or, flood, alarm, or, another, electrical, condition, such, as, over, voltage, detection, shunt, trips, may, be, a, user, fitted, accessory, to, a, standard, breaker, or, supplied, as, an, integral, part, of, a, circuit, breaker, medium, voltage, circuit, breakers, rated, between, 1, and, 72, kv, may, be, assembled, into, metal, enclosed, switchgear, line, ups, for, indoor, use, or, may, be, individual, components, installed, outdoors, in, a, substation, air, break, circuit, breakers, replaced, oil, filled, units, for, indoor, applications, but, are, now, themselves, being, replaced, by, vacuum, circuit, breakers, up, to, about, 40, 5, kv, like, the, high, voltage, circuit, breakers, described, below, these, are, also, operated, by, current, sensing, protective, relays, operated, through, current, transformers, the, characteristics, of, mv, breakers, are, given, by, international, standards, such, as, iec, 62271, medium, voltage, circuit, breakers, nearly, always, use, separate, current, sensors, and, protective, relays, instead, of, relying, on, built, in, thermal, or, magnetic, overcurrent, sensors, medium, voltage, circuit, breakers, can, be, classified, by, the, medium, used, to, extinguish, the, arc, medium, voltage, circuit, breakers, may, be, connected, into, the, circuit, by, bolted, connections, to, bus, bars, or, wires, especially, in, outdoor, switchyards, medium, voltage, circuit, breakers, in, switchgear, line, ups, are, often, built, with, draw, out, construction, allowing, breaker, removal, without, disturbing, power, circuit, connections, using, a, motor, operated, or, hand, cranked, mechanism, to, separate, the, breaker, from, its, enclosure, electrical, power, transmission, networks, are, protected, and, controlled, by, high, voltage, breakers, the, definition, of, high, voltage, varies, but, in, power, transmission, work, is, usually, thought, to, be, 72, 5, kv, or, higher, according, to, a, recent, definition, by, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, iec, high, voltage, breakers, are, nearly, always, solenoid, operated, with, current, sensing, protective, relays, operated, through, current, transformers, in, substations, the, protective, relay, scheme, can, be, complex, protecting, equipment, and, buses, from, various, types, of, overload, or, ground, earth, fault, high, voltage, breakers, are, broadly, classified, by, the, medium, used, to, extinguish, the, arc, due, to, environmental, and, cost, concerns, over, insulating, oil, spills, most, new, breakers, use, sf, 6, gas, to, quench, the, arc, circuit, breakers, can, be, classified, as, live, tank, where, the, enclosure, that, contains, the, breaking, mechanism, is, at, line, potential, or, dead, tank, with, the, enclosure, at, earth, potential, high, voltage, ac, circuit, breakers, are, routinely, available, with, ratings, up, to, 765, kv, 1, 200, kv, breakers, were, launched, by, siemens, in, november, 2011, followed, by, abb, in, april, the, following, year, high, voltage, circuit, breakers, used, on, transmission, systems, may, be, arranged, to, allow, a, single, pole, of, a, three, phase, line, to, trip, instead, of, tripping, all, three, poles, for, some, classes, of, faults, this, improves, the, system, stability, and, availability, high, voltage, direct, current, circuit, breakers, are, still, a, field, of, research, as, of, 2015, such, breakers, would, be, useful, to, interconnect, hvdc, transmission, systems, a, sulfur, hexafluoride, circuit, breaker, uses, contacts, surrounded, by, sulfur, hexafluoride, gas, to, quench, the, arc, they, are, most, often, used, for, transmission, level, voltages, and, may, be, incorporated, into, compact, gas, insulated, switchgear, in, cold, climates, supplemental, heating, or, different, gas, mixtures, are, used, for, high, voltage, circuit, breakers, due, to, liquefaction, of, the, sf, 6, gas, in, some, northern, power, grids, gas, mixtures, of, n, 2, and, sf, 6, or, cf, 4, and, sf, 6, are, installed, in, puffer, type, hvcb, to, quench, the, arc, without, any, liquefaction, of, the, gas, https, ieeexplore, ieee, org, abstract, document, 4080767, the, minimum, temperature, ratings, of, these, models, are, as, low, as, 50, c, for, some, northern, substations, the, disconnecting, circuit, breaker, dcb, was, introduced, in, 2000, and, is, a, high, voltage, circuit, breaker, modeled, after, the, sf, 6, breaker, it, presents, a, technical, solution, where, the, disconnecting, function, is, integrated, in, the, breaking, chamber, eliminating, the, need, for, separate, disconnectors, this, increases, the, availability, since, open, air, disconnecting, switch, main, contacts, need, maintenance, every, 2, 6, years, while, modern, circuit, breakers, have, maintenance, intervals, of, 15, years, implementing, a, dcb, solution, also, reduces, the, space, requirements, within, the, substation, and, increases, the, reliability, due, to, the, lack, of, separate, disconnectors, in, order, to, further, reduce, the, required, space, of, substation, as, well, as, simplifying, the, design, and, engineering, of, the, substation, a, fiber, optic, current, sensor, focs, can, be, integrated, with, the, dcb, a, 420, kv, dcb, with, integrated, focs, can, reduce, a, substation, s, footprint, with, over, 50, compared, to, a, conventional, solution, of, live, tank, breakers, with, disconnectors, and, current, transformers, due, to, reduced, material, and, no, additional, insulation, medium, in, 2012, abb, presented, a, 75, kv, high, voltage, breaker, that, uses, carbon, dioxide, as, the, medium, to, extinguish, the, arc, the, carbon, dioxide, breaker, works, on, the, same, principles, as, an, sf, 6, breaker, and, can, also, be, produced, as, a, disconnecting, circuit, breaker, by, switching, from, sf, 6, to, co, 2, it, is, possible, to, reduce, the, co, 2, emissions, by, 10, tons, during, the, product, s, life, cycle, several, firms, have, looked, at, adding, monitoring, for, appliances, via, electronics, or, using, a, digital, circuit, breaker, to, monitor, the, breakers, remotely, utility, companies, in, the, united, states, have, been, reviewing, use, of, the, technology, to, turn, appliances, on, and, off, as, well, as, potentially, turning, off, charging, of, electric, cars, during, periods, of, high, electrical, grid, load, these, devices, under, research, and, testing, would, have, wireless, capability, to, monitor, the, electrical, usage, in, a, house, via, a, smartphone, app, or, other, means, the, following, types, are, described, in, separate, articles
