in, computer, science, and, computer, engineering, computer, architecture, is, a, description, of, the, structure, of, a, computer, system, made, from, component, parts, it, can, sometimes, be, a, high, level, description, that, ignores, details, of, the, implementation, at, a, more, detailed, level, the, description, may, include, the, instruction, set, architecture, design, microarchitecture, design, logic, design, and, implementation, the, first, documented, computer, architecture, was, in, the, correspondence, between, charles, babbage, and, ada, lovelace, describing, the, analytical, engine, while, building, the, computer, z1, in, 1936, konrad, zuse, described, in, two, patent, applications, for, his, future, projects, that, machine, instructions, could, be, stored, in, the, same, storage, used, for, data, i, e, the, stored, program, concept, two, other, early, and, important, examples, are, the, term, architecture, in, computer, literature, can, be, traced, to, the, work, of, lyle, r, johnson, and, frederick, p, brooks, jr, members, of, the, machine, organization, department, in, ibm, s, main, research, center, in, 1959, johnson, had, the, opportunity, to, write, a, proprietary, research, communication, about, the, stretch, an, ibm, developed, supercomputer, for, los, alamos, national, laboratory, at, the, time, known, as, los, alamos, scientific, laboratory, to, describe, the, level, of, detail, for, discussing, the, luxuriously, embellished, computer, he, noted, that, his, description, of, formats, instruction, types, hardware, parameters, and, speed, enhancements, were, at, the, level, of, system, architecture, a, term, that, seemed, more, useful, than, machine, organization, subsequently, brooks, a, stretch, designer, opened, chapter, 2, of, a, book, called, planning, a, computer, system, project, stretch, by, stating, computer, architecture, like, other, architecture, is, the, art, of, determining, the, needs, of, the, user, of, a, structure, and, then, designing, to, meet, those, needs, as, effectively, as, possible, within, economic, and, technological, constraints, brooks, went, on, to, help, develop, the, ibm, system, 360, now, called, the, ibm, zseries, line, of, computers, in, which, architecture, became, a, noun, defining, what, the, user, needs, to, know, later, computer, users, came, to, use, the, term, in, many, less, explicit, ways, the, earliest, computer, architectures, were, designed, on, paper, and, then, directly, built, into, the, final, hardware, form, later, computer, architecture, prototypes, were, physically, built, in, the, form, of, a, transistor, transistor, logic, ttl, computer, such, as, the, prototypes, of, the, 6800, and, the, pa, risc, tested, and, tweaked, before, committing, to, the, final, hardware, form, as, of, the, 1990s, new, computer, architectures, are, typically, built, tested, and, tweaked, inside, some, other, computer, architecture, in, a, computer, architecture, simulator, or, inside, a, fpga, as, a, soft, microprocessor, or, both, before, committing, to, the, final, hardware, form, the, discipline, of, computer, architecture, has, three, main, subcategories, there, are, other, technologies, in, computer, architecture, the, following, technologies, are, used, in, bigger, companies, like, intel, and, were, estimated, in, 2002, to, count, for, 1, of, all, of, computer, architecture, computer, architecture, is, concerned, with, balancing, the, performance, efficiency, cost, and, reliability, of, a, computer, system, the, case, of, instruction, set, architecture, can, be, used, to, illustrate, the, balance, of, these, competing, factors, more, complex, instruction, sets, enable, programmers, to, write, more, space, efficient, programs, since, a, single, instruction, can, encode, some, higher, level, abstraction, such, as, the, x86, loop, instruction, however, longer, and, more, complex, instructions, take, longer, for, the, processor, to, decode, and, can, be, more, costly, to, implement, effectively, the, increased, complexity, from, a, large, instruction, set, also, creates, more, room, for, unreliability, when, instructions, interact, in, unexpected, ways, the, implementation, involves, integrated, circuit, design, packaging, power, and, cooling, optimization, of, the, design, requires, familiarity, with, compilers, operating, systems, to, logic, design, and, packaging, an, instruction, set, architecture, isa, is, the, interface, between, the, computer, s, software, and, hardware, and, also, can, be, viewed, as, the, programmer, s, view, of, the, machine, computers, do, not, understand, high, level, programming, languages, such, as, java, c, or, most, programming, languages, used, a, processor, only, understands, instructions, encoded, in, some, numerical, fashion, usually, as, binary, numbers, software, tools, such, as, compilers, translate, those, high, level, languages, into, instructions, that, the, processor, can, understand, besides, instructions, the, isa, defines, items, in, the, computer, that, are, available, to, a, program, e, g, data, types, registers, addressing, modes, and, memory, instructions, locate, these, available, items, with, register, indexes, or, names, and, memory, addressing, modes, the, isa, of, a, computer, is, usually, described, in, a, small, instruction, manual, which, describes, how, the, instructions, are, encoded, also, it, may, define, short, vaguely, mnemonic, names, for, the, instructions, the, names, can, be, recognized, by, a, software, development, tool, called, an, assembler, an, assembler, is, a, computer, program, that, translates, a, human, readable, form, of, the, isa, into, a, computer, readable, form, disassemblers, are, also, widely, available, usually, in, debuggers, and, software, programs, to, isolate, and, correct, malfunctions, in, binary, computer, programs, isas, vary, in, quality, and, completeness, a, good, isa, compromises, between, programmer, convenience, how, easy, the, code, is, to, understand, size, of, the, code, how, much, code, is, required, to, do, a, specific, action, cost, of, the, computer, to, interpret, the, instructions, more, complexity, means, more, hardware, needed, to, decode, and, execute, the, instructions, and, speed, of, the, computer, with, more, complex, decoding, hardware, comes, longer, decode, time, memory, organization, defines, how, instructions, interact, with, the, memory, and, how, memory, interacts, with, itself, during, design, emulation, emulators, can, run, programs, written, in, a, proposed, instruction, set, modern, emulators, can, measure, size, cost, and, speed, to, determine, whether, a, particular, isa, is, meeting, its, goals, computer, organization, helps, optimize, performance, based, products, for, example, software, engineers, need, to, know, the, processing, power, of, processors, they, may, need, to, optimize, software, in, order, to, gain, the, most, performance, for, the, lowest, price, this, can, require, quite, a, detailed, analysis, of, the, computer, s, organization, for, example, in, an, sd, card, the, designers, might, need, to, arrange, the, card, so, that, the, most, data, can, be, processed, in, the, fastest, possible, way, computer, organization, also, helps, plan, the, selection, of, a, processor, for, a, particular, project, multimedia, projects, may, need, very, rapid, data, access, while, virtual, machines, may, need, fast, interrupts, sometimes, certain, tasks, need, additional, components, as, well, for, example, a, computer, capable, of, running, a, virtual, machine, needs, virtual, memory, hardware, so, that, the, memory, of, different, virtual, computers, can, be, kept, separated, computer, organization, and, features, also, affect, power, consumption, and, processor, cost, once, an, instruction, set, and, micro, architecture, have, been, designed, a, practical, machine, must, be, developed, this, design, process, is, called, the, implementation, implementation, is, usually, not, considered, architectural, design, but, rather, hardware, design, engineering, implementation, can, be, further, broken, down, into, several, steps, for, cpus, the, entire, implementation, process, is, organized, differently, and, is, often, referred, to, as, cpu, design, the, exact, form, of, a, computer, system, depends, on, the, constraints, and, goals, computer, architectures, usually, trade, off, standards, power, versus, performance, cost, memory, capacity, latency, latency, is, the, amount, of, time, that, it, takes, for, information, from, one, node, to, travel, to, the, source, and, throughput, sometimes, other, considerations, such, as, features, size, weight, reliability, and, expandability, are, also, factors, the, most, common, scheme, does, an, in, depth, power, analysis, and, figures, out, how, to, keep, power, consumption, low, while, maintaining, adequate, performance, modern, computer, performance, is, often, described, in, instructions, per, cycle, ipc, which, measures, the, efficiency, of, the, architecture, at, any, clock, frequency, a, faster, ipc, rate, means, the, computer, is, faster, older, computers, had, ipc, counts, as, low, as, 0, 1, while, modern, processors, easily, reach, nearly, 1, superscalar, processors, may, reach, three, to, five, ipc, by, executing, several, instructions, per, clock, cycle, counting, machine, language, instructions, would, be, misleading, because, they, can, do, varying, amounts, of, work, in, different, isas, the, instruction, in, the, standard, measurements, is, not, a, count, of, the, isa, s, machine, language, instructions, but, a, unit, of, measurement, usually, based, on, the, speed, of, the, vax, computer, architecture, many, people, used, to, measure, a, computer, s, speed, by, the, clock, rate, usually, in, mhz, or, ghz, this, refers, to, the, cycles, per, second, of, the, main, clock, of, the, cpu, however, this, metric, is, somewhat, misleading, as, a, machine, with, a, higher, clock, rate, may, not, necessarily, have, greater, performance, as, a, result, manufacturers, have, moved, away, from, clock, speed, as, a, measure, of, performance, other, factors, influence, speed, such, as, the, mix, of, functional, units, bus, speeds, available, memory, and, the, type, and, order, of, instructions, in, the, programs, there, are, two, main, types, of, speed, latency, and, throughput, latency, is, the, time, between, the, start, of, a, process, and, its, completion, throughput, is, the, amount, of, work, done, per, unit, time, interrupt, latency, is, the, guaranteed, maximum, response, time, of, the, system, to, an, electronic, event, like, when, the, disk, drive, finishes, moving, some, data, performance, is, affected, by, a, very, wide, range, of, design, choices, for, example, pipelining, a, processor, usually, makes, latency, worse, but, makes, throughput, better, computers, that, control, machinery, usually, need, low, interrupt, latencies, these, computers, operate, in, a, real, time, environment, and, fail, if, an, operation, is, not, completed, in, a, specified, amount, of, time, for, example, computer, controlled, anti, lock, brakes, must, begin, braking, within, a, predictable, and, limited, time, period, after, the, brake, pedal, is, sensed, or, else, failure, of, the, brake, will, occur, benchmarking, takes, all, these, factors, into, account, by, measuring, the, time, a, computer, takes, to, run, through, a, series, of, test, programs, although, benchmarking, shows, strengths, it, should, not, be, how, you, choose, a, computer, often, the, measured, machines, split, on, different, measures, for, example, one, system, might, handle, scientific, applications, quickly, while, another, might, render, video, games, more, smoothly, furthermore, designers, may, target, and, add, special, features, to, their, products, through, hardware, or, software, that, permit, a, specific, benchmark, to, execute, quickly, but, do, not, offer, similar, advantages, to, general, tasks, power, efficiency, is, another, important, measurement, in, modern, computers, higher, power, efficiency, can, often, be, traded, for, lower, speed, or, higher, cost, the, typical, measurement, when, referring, to, power, consumption, in, computer, architecture, is, mips, w, millions, of, instructions, per, second, per, watt, modern, circuits, have, less, power, required, per, transistor, as, the, number, of, transistors, per, chip, grows, this, is, because, each, transistor, that, is, put, in, a, new, chip, requires, its, own, power, supply, and, requires, new, pathways, to, be, built, to, power, it, however, the, number, of, transistors, per, chip, is, starting, to, increase, at, a, slower, rate, therefore, power, efficiency, is, starting, to, become, as, important, if, not, more, important, than, fitting, more, and, more, transistors, into, a, single, chip, recent, processor, designs, have, shown, this, emphasis, as, they, put, more, focus, on, power, efficiency, rather, than, cramming, as, many, transistors, into, a, single, chip, as, possible, in, the, world, of, embedded, computers, power, efficiency, has, long, been, an, important, goal, next, to, throughput, and, latency, increases, in, clock, frequency, have, grown, more, slowly, over, the, past, few, years, compared, to, power, reduction, improvements, this, has, been, driven, by, the, end, of, moore, s, law, and, demand, for, longer, battery, life, and, reductions, in, size, for, mobile, technology, this, change, in, focus, from, higher, clock, rates, to, power, consumption, and, miniaturization, can, be, shown, by, the, significant, reductions, in, power, consumption, as, much, as, 50, that, were, reported, by, intel, in, their, release, of, the, haswell, microarchitecture, where, they, dropped, their, power, consumption, benchmark, from, 30, to, 40, watts, down, to, 10, 20, watts, comparing, this, to, the, processing, speed, increase, of, 3, ghz, to, 4, ghz, 2002, to, 2006, it, can, be, seen, that, the, focus, in, research, and, development, is, shifting, away, from, clock, frequency, and, moving, towards, consuming, less, power, and, taking, up, less, space
