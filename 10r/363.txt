a, rope, is, a, group, of, yarns, plies, fibres, or, strands, that, are, twisted, or, braided, together, into, a, larger, and, stronger, form, ropes, have, tensile, strength, and, so, can, be, used, for, dragging, and, lifting, rope, is, thicker, and, stronger, than, similarly, constructed, cord, string, and, twine, rope, may, be, constructed, of, any, long, stringy, fibrous, material, but, generally, is, constructed, of, certain, natural, or, synthetic, fibres, synthetic, fibre, ropes, are, significantly, stronger, than, their, natural, fibre, counterparts, they, have, a, higher, tensile, strength, they, are, more, resistant, to, rotting, than, ropes, created, from, natural, fibres, and, they, can, be, made, to, float, on, water, but, synthetic, ropes, also, possess, certain, disadvantages, including, slipperiness, and, some, can, be, damaged, more, easily, by, uv, light, common, natural, fibres, for, rope, are, manila, hemp, hemp, linen, cotton, coir, jute, straw, and, sisal, synthetic, fibres, in, use, for, rope, making, include, polypropylene, nylon, polyesters, e, g, pet, lcp, vectran, polyethylene, e, g, dyneema, and, spectra, aramids, e, g, twaron, technora, and, kevlar, and, acrylics, e, g, dralon, some, ropes, are, constructed, of, mixtures, of, several, fibres, or, use, co, polymer, fibres, wire, rope, is, made, of, steel, or, other, metal, alloys, ropes, have, been, constructed, of, other, fibrous, materials, such, as, silk, wool, and, hair, but, such, ropes, are, not, generally, available, rayon, is, a, regenerated, fibre, used, to, make, decorative, rope, the, twist, of, the, strands, in, a, twisted, or, braided, rope, serves, not, only, to, keep, a, rope, together, but, enables, the, rope, to, more, evenly, distribute, tension, among, the, individual, strands, without, any, twist, in, the, rope, the, shortest, strand, s, would, always, be, supporting, a, much, higher, proportion, of, the, total, load, because, rope, has, a, long, history, many, systems, have, been, used, to, specify, the, size, of, a, rope, in, systems, that, use, the, inch, imperial, and, us, customary, measurement, systems, large, ropes, over, 1, inch, 25, 4, mm, diameter, such, as, those, used, on, ships, are, measured, by, their, circumference, in, inches, smaller, ropes, have, a, nominal, diameter, based, on, the, circumference, divided, by, three, as, a, rough, approximation, of, pi, in, the, metric, system, of, measurement, the, nominal, diameter, is, given, in, millimetres, the, current, preferred, international, standard, for, rope, sizes, is, to, give, the, mass, per, unit, length, in, kilograms, per, metre, however, even, sources, otherwise, using, metric, units, may, still, give, a, rope, number, for, large, ropes, which, is, the, circumference, in, inches, rope, has, been, used, since, prehistoric, times, it, is, of, paramount, importance, in, fields, as, diverse, as, construction, seafaring, exploration, sports, theatre, and, communications, many, types, of, knots, have, been, developed, to, fasten, with, rope, join, ropes, and, utilize, rope, to, generate, mechanical, advantage, pulleys, can, redirect, the, pulling, force, of, a, rope, in, another, direction, multiply, its, lifting, or, pulling, power, and, distribute, a, load, over, multiple, parts, of, the, same, rope, to, increase, safety, and, decrease, wear, winches, and, capstans, are, machines, designed, to, pull, ropes, the, use, of, ropes, for, hunting, pulling, fastening, attaching, carrying, lifting, and, climbing, dates, back, to, prehistoric, times, it, is, likely, that, the, earliest, ropes, were, naturally, occurring, lengths, of, plant, fibre, such, as, vines, followed, soon, by, the, first, attempts, at, twisting, and, braiding, these, strands, together, to, form, the, first, proper, ropes, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, word, the, earliest, evidence, of, suspected, rope, is, a, very, small, fragment, of, three, ply, cord, from, a, neanderthal, site, dated, 50, 000, years, ago, this, item, was, so, small, it, was, only, discovered, and, described, with, the, help, of, a, high, power, microscope, it, is, slightly, thicker, than, the, average, thumb, nail, and, would, not, stretch, from, edge, to, edge, across, a, little, finger, nail, there, are, other, ways, fibres, can, twist, in, nature, without, deliberate, construction, a, tool, dated, between, 35, 000, and, 40, 000, years, found, in, the, hohle, fels, cave, in, south, western, germany, has, been, identified, as, a, means, for, making, rope, it, is, a, 20, cm, 8, in, strip, of, mammoth, ivory, with, four, holes, drilled, through, it, each, hole, is, lined, with, precisely, cut, spiral, incisions, the, grooves, on, three, of, the, holes, spiral, in, a, clockwise, direction, from, each, side, of, the, strip, the, grooves, on, one, hole, spiral, clockwise, on, one, side, but, counter, clockwise, from, the, other, side, plant, fibres, have, been, found, on, it, that, could, have, come, from, when, they, fed, through, the, holes, and, the, tool, twisted, creating, a, single, ply, yarn, fiber, making, experiments, with, a, replica, found, that, the, perforations, served, as, effective, guides, for, raw, fibers, making, it, easier, to, make, a, strong, elastic, rope, than, simply, twisting, fibers, by, hand, spiral, incisions, would, have, tended, to, keep, the, fibres, in, place, but, the, incisions, cannot, impart, any, twist, to, the, fibres, pulled, through, the, holes, other, 15, 000, year, old, objects, with, holes, with, spiral, incisions, made, from, reindeer, antler, found, across, europe, are, thought, to, have, been, used, to, manipulate, ropes, or, perhaps, some, other, purpose, they, were, originally, named, batons, and, thought, possibly, to, have, been, carried, as, badges, of, rank, impressions, of, cordage, found, on, fired, clay, provide, evidence, of, string, and, rope, making, technology, in, europe, dating, back, 28, 000, years, fossilized, fragments, of, probably, two, ply, laid, rope, of, about, 7, mm, diameter, were, found, in, one, of, the, caves, at, lascaux, dating, to, approximately, 15, 000, bc, the, ancient, egyptians, were, probably, the, first, civilization, to, develop, special, tools, to, make, rope, egyptian, rope, dates, back, to, 4000, to, 3500, bc, and, was, generally, made, of, water, reed, fibres, other, rope, in, antiquity, was, made, from, the, fibres, of, date, palms, flax, grass, papyrus, leather, or, animal, hair, the, use, of, such, ropes, pulled, by, thousands, of, workers, allowed, the, egyptians, to, move, the, heavy, stones, required, to, build, their, monuments, starting, from, approximately, 2800, bc, rope, made, of, hemp, fibres, was, in, use, in, china, rope, and, the, craft, of, rope, making, spread, throughout, asia, india, and, europe, over, the, next, several, thousand, years, from, the, middle, ages, until, the, 18th, century, in, europe, ropes, were, constructed, in, ropewalks, very, long, buildings, where, strands, the, full, length, of, the, rope, were, spread, out, and, then, laid, up, or, twisted, together, to, form, the, rope, the, cable, length, was, thus, set, by, the, length, of, the, available, rope, walk, this, is, related, to, the, unit, of, length, termed, cable, length, this, allowed, for, long, ropes, of, up, to, 300, yards, 270, m, long, or, longer, to, be, made, these, long, ropes, were, necessary, in, shipping, as, short, ropes, would, require, splicing, to, make, them, long, enough, to, use, for, sheets, and, halyards, the, strongest, form, of, splicing, is, the, short, splice, which, doubles, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, rope, at, the, area, of, the, splice, which, would, cause, problems, in, running, the, line, through, pulleys, any, splices, narrow, enough, to, maintain, smooth, running, would, be, less, able, to, support, the, required, weight, rope, intended, for, naval, use, would, have, a, coloured, yarn, known, as, the, rogue, s, yarn, included, in, the, layup, this, enabled, the, source, to, be, identified, and, to, detect, pilfering, leonardo, da, vinci, drew, sketches, of, a, concept, for, a, ropemaking, machine, but, it, was, never, built, remarkable, feats, of, construction, were, accomplished, using, rope, but, without, advanced, technology, in, 1586, domenico, fontana, erected, the, 327, ton, obelisk, on, rome, s, saint, peter, s, square, with, a, concerted, effort, of, 900, men, 75, horses, and, countless, pulleys, and, meters, of, rope, by, the, late, 18th, century, several, working, machines, had, been, built, and, patented, some, rope, is, still, made, from, natural, fibres, such, as, coir, and, sisal, despite, the, dominance, of, synthetic, fibres, such, as, nylon, and, polypropylene, which, have, become, increasingly, popular, since, the, 1950s, nylon, was, discovered, in, the, late, 1930s, and, was, first, introduced, into, fiber, ropes, during, world, war, ii, indeed, the, first, synthetic, fiber, ropes, were, small, braided, parachute, cords, and, three, strand, tow, ropes, for, gliders, made, of, nylon, during, world, war, ii, laid, rope, also, called, twisted, rope, is, historically, the, prevalent, form, of, rope, at, least, in, modern, western, history, common, twisted, rope, generally, consists, of, three, strands, and, is, normally, right, laid, or, given, a, final, right, handed, twist, the, iso, 2, standard, uses, the, uppercase, letters, s, and, z, to, indicate, the, two, possible, directions, of, twist, as, suggested, by, the, direction, of, slant, of, the, central, portions, of, these, two, letters, the, handedness, of, the, twist, is, the, direction, of, the, twists, as, they, progress, away, from, an, observer, thus, z, twist, rope, is, said, to, be, right, handed, and, s, twist, to, be, left, handed, twisted, ropes, are, built, up, in, three, steps, first, fibres, are, gathered, and, spun, into, yarns, a, number, of, these, yarns, are, then, formed, into, strands, by, twisting, the, strands, are, then, twisted, together, to, lay, the, rope, the, twist, of, the, yarn, is, opposite, to, that, of, the, strand, and, that, in, turn, is, opposite, to, that, of, the, rope, it, is, this, counter, twist, introduced, with, each, successive, operation, which, holds, the, final, rope, together, as, a, stable, unified, object, traditionally, a, three, strand, laid, rope, is, called, a, plain, or, hawser, laid, a, four, strand, rope, is, called, shroud, laid, and, a, larger, rope, formed, by, counter, twisting, three, or, more, multi, strand, ropes, together, is, called, cable, laid, cable, laid, rope, is, sometimes, clamped, to, maintain, a, tight, counter, twist, rendering, the, resulting, cable, virtually, waterproof, without, this, feature, deep, water, sailing, before, the, advent, of, steel, chains, and, other, lines, was, largely, impossible, as, any, appreciable, length, of, rope, for, anchoring, or, ship, to, ship, transfers, would, become, too, waterlogged, and, therefore, too, heavy, to, lift, even, with, the, aid, of, a, capstan, or, windlass, one, property, of, laid, rope, is, partial, untwisting, when, used, this, can, cause, spinning, of, suspended, loads, or, stretching, kinking, or, hockling, of, the, rope, itself, an, additional, drawback, of, twisted, construction, is, that, every, fibre, is, exposed, to, abrasion, numerous, times, along, the, length, of, the, rope, this, means, that, the, rope, can, degrade, to, numerous, inch, long, fibre, fragments, which, is, not, easily, detected, visually, twisted, ropes, have, a, preferred, direction, for, coiling, normal, right, laid, rope, should, be, coiled, clockwise, to, prevent, kinking, coiling, this, way, imparts, a, twist, to, the, rope, rope, of, this, type, must, be, bound, at, its, ends, by, some, means, to, prevent, untwisting, while, rope, may, be, made, from, three, or, more, strands, modern, braided, rope, consists, of, a, braided, tubular, jacket, over, strands, of, fibre, these, may, also, be, braided, some, forms, of, braided, rope, with, untwisted, cores, have, a, particular, advantage, they, do, not, impart, an, additional, twisting, force, when, they, are, stressed, the, lack, of, added, twisting, forces, is, an, advantage, when, a, load, is, freely, suspended, as, when, a, rope, is, used, for, rappelling, or, to, suspend, an, arborist, other, specialized, cores, reduce, the, shock, from, arresting, a, fall, when, used, as, a, part, of, a, personal, or, group, safety, system, braided, ropes, are, generally, made, from, nylon, polyester, polypropylene, or, high, performance, fibres, such, as, high, modulus, polyethylene, hmpe, and, aramid, nylon, is, chosen, for, its, strength, and, elastic, stretch, properties, however, nylon, absorbs, water, and, is, 10, 15, weaker, when, wet, polyester, is, about, 90, as, strong, as, nylon, but, stretches, less, under, load, and, is, not, affected, by, water, it, has, somewhat, better, uv, resistance, and, is, more, abrasion, resistant, polypropylene, is, preferred, for, low, cost, and, light, weight, it, floats, on, water, but, it, has, limited, resistance, to, ultraviolet, light, is, susceptible, to, friction, and, has, a, poor, heat, resistance, braided, ropes, and, objects, like, garden, hoses, fibre, optic, or, coaxial, cables, etc, that, have, no, lay, or, inherent, twist, uncoil, better, if, each, alternate, loop, is, twisted, in, the, opposite, direction, such, as, in, figure, eight, coils, where, the, twist, reverses, regularly, and, essentially, cancels, out, single, braid, consists, of, an, even, number, of, strands, eight, or, twelve, being, typical, braided, into, a, circular, pattern, with, half, of, the, strands, going, clockwise, and, the, other, half, going, anticlockwise, the, strands, can, interlock, with, either, twill, or, panama, basked, or, seldom, plain, weave, kyosev, introduced, the, german, notation, in, english, where, the, floating, length, german, flechtigkeit, and, the, number, of, yarns, in, a, group, german, f, digkeit, in, more, natural, way, for, braiding, process, are, used, instead, of, the, pattern, names, in, weaving, the, central, void, may, be, large, or, small, in, the, former, case, the, term, hollow, braid, is, sometimes, preferred, double, braid, also, called, braid, on, braid, consists, of, an, inner, braid, filling, the, central, void, in, an, outer, braid, that, may, be, of, the, same, or, different, material, often, the, inner, braid, fibre, is, chosen, for, strength, while, the, outer, braid, fibre, is, chosen, for, abrasion, resistance, in, a, solid, braid, square, braid, gasket, or, form, braid, there, are, at, least, three, or, more, groups, of, yarns, interlacing, in, complex, interlocking, structure, this, construction, is, popular, for, gaskets, and, general, purpose, utility, rope, but, rare, in, specialized, high, performance, line, kernmantle, rope, has, a, core, kern, of, long, twisted, fibres, in, the, center, with, a, braided, outer, sheath, or, mantle, of, woven, fibres, the, kern, provides, most, of, the, strength, about, 70, while, the, mantle, protects, the, kern, and, determines, the, handling, properties, of, the, rope, how, easy, it, is, to, hold, to, tie, knots, in, and, so, on, in, dynamic, climbing, line, core, fibres, are, usually, twisted, to, make, the, rope, more, elastic, static, kernmantle, ropes, are, made, with, untwisted, core, fibres, and, tighter, braid, which, causes, them, to, be, stiffer, in, addition, to, limiting, the, stretch, plaited, rope, is, made, by, braiding, twisted, strands, and, is, also, called, square, braid, it, is, not, as, round, as, twisted, rope, and, coarser, to, the, touch, it, is, less, prone, to, kinking, than, twisted, rope, and, depending, on, the, material, very, flexible, and, therefore, easy, to, handle, and, knot, this, construction, exposes, all, fibres, as, well, with, the, same, drawbacks, as, described, above, brait, rope, is, a, combination, of, braided, and, plaited, a, non, rotating, alternative, to, laid, three, strand, ropes, due, to, its, excellent, energy, absorption, characteristics, it, is, often, used, by, arborists, it, is, also, a, popular, rope, for, anchoring, and, can, be, used, as, mooring, warps, this, type, of, construction, was, pioneered, by, yale, cordage, endless, winding, rope, is, made, by, winding, single, strands, of, high, performance, yarns, around, two, end, terminations, until, the, desired, break, strength, or, stiffness, has, been, reached, this, type, of, rope, often, specified, as, cable, to, make, the, difference, between, a, braided, or, twined, construction, has, the, advantage, of, having, no, construction, stretch, as, is, the, case, with, above, constructions, endless, winding, is, pioneered, by, smartrigging, and, fibremax, the, sport, of, rock, climbing, uses, what, is, termed, dynamic, rope, an, elastic, rope, which, stretches, under, load, to, absorb, the, energy, generated, in, arresting, a, fall, without, creating, forces, high, enough, to, injure, the, climber, such, ropes, are, of, kernmantle, construction, as, described, below, conversely, static, ropes, have, minimal, stretch, and, are, not, designed, to, arrest, free, falls, they, are, used, in, caving, rappelling, rescue, applications, and, industries, such, as, window, washing, the, uiaa, in, concert, with, the, cen, sets, climbing, rope, standards, and, oversees, testing, any, rope, bearing, a, guiana, or, ce, certification, tag, is, suitable, for, climbing, climbing, ropes, cut, easily, when, under, load, keeping, them, away, from, sharp, rock, edges, is, imperative, previous, falls, arrested, by, a, rope, damage, to, its, sheath, and, contamination, by, dirt, or, solvents, all, weaken, a, rope, and, can, render, it, unsuitable, for, further, sport, use, rock, climbing, ropes, are, designated, as, suitable, for, single, double, or, twin, use, a, single, rope, is, the, most, common, and, is, intended, to, be, used, by, itself, these, range, in, thickness, from, roughly, 9, to, 11, mm, 0, 35, to, 0, 43, in, smaller, diameter, ropes, are, lighter, but, wear, out, faster, double, ropes, are, thinner, than, single, usually, 9, mm, 0, 35, in, and, under, and, are, intended, for, use, in, pairs, these, offer, a, greater, margin, of, safety, against, cutting, since, it, is, unlikely, that, both, ropes, will, be, cut, but, complicate, both, belaying, and, leading, double, ropes, may, be, clipped, into, alternating, pieces, of, protection, allowing, each, to, stay, straighter, and, reduce, both, individual, and, total, rope, drag, twin, ropes, are, thin, ropes, which, must, be, clipped, into, the, same, piece, of, protection, in, effect, being, treated, as, a, single, strand, this, adds, security, in, situations, where, a, rope, may, get, cut, however, new, lighter, weight, ropes, with, greater, safety, have, virtually, replaced, this, type, of, rope, the, butterfly, and, alpine, coils, are, methods, of, coiling, a, rope, for, carrying, rope, made, from, hemp, cotton, or, nylon, is, generally, stored, in, a, cool, dry, place, for, proper, storage, to, prevent, kinking, it, is, usually, coiled, to, prevent, fraying, or, unravelling, the, ends, of, a, rope, are, bound, with, twine, whipping, tape, or, heat, shrink, tubing, the, ends, of, plastic, fibre, ropes, are, often, melted, and, fused, solid, however, the, rope, and, knotting, expert, geoffrey, budworth, warns, against, this, practice, thus, sealing, rope, ends, this, way, is, lazy, and, dangerous, a, tugboat, operator, once, sliced, the, palm, of, his, hand, open, down, to, the, sinews, after, the, hardened, and, obviously, sharp, end, of, a, rope, that, had, been, heat, sealed, pulled, through, his, grasp, there, is, no, substitute, for, a, properly, made, whipping, if, a, load, bearing, rope, gets, a, sharp, or, sudden, jolt, or, the, rope, shows, signs, of, deteriorating, it, is, recommended, that, the, rope, be, replaced, immediately, and, should, be, discarded, or, only, used, for, non, load, bearing, tasks, the, average, rope, life, span, is, 5, years, serious, inspection, should, be, given, to, line, after, that, point, however, the, use, to, which, a, rope, is, put, affects, frequency, of, inspection, rope, used, in, mission, critical, applications, such, as, mooring, lines, or, running, rigging, should, be, regularly, inspected, on, a, much, shorter, timescale, than, this, and, rope, used, in, life, critical, applications, such, as, mountain, climbing, should, be, inspected, on, a, far, more, frequent, basis, up, to, and, including, before, each, use, avoid, stepping, on, climbing, rope, as, this, might, force, tiny, pieces, of, rock, through, the, sheath, which, can, eventually, deteriorate, the, core, of, the, rope, ropes, may, be, flemished, into, coils, on, deck, for, safety, presentation, and, tidiness, many, types, of, filaments, in, ropes, are, weakened, by, corrosive, liquids, solvents, and, high, temperatures, such, damage, is, particularly, treacherous, because, it, is, often, invisible, to, the, eye, shock, loading, should, be, avoided, with, general, use, ropes, as, it, can, damage, them, all, ropes, should, be, used, within, a, safe, working, load, which, is, much, less, than, their, breaking, strength, a, rope, under, tension, particularly, if, it, has, a, great, deal, of, elasticity, can, be, dangerous, if, parted, care, should, be, taken, around, lines, under, load, rope, is, a, material, and, a, tool, when, it, is, assigned, a, specific, function, it, is, often, referred, to, as, a, line, especially, in, nautical, usage, a, line, may, get, a, further, distinction, for, example, sail, control, lines, are, known, as, sheets, e, g, a, jib, sheet, a, halyard, is, a, line, used, to, raise, and, lower, a, sail, typically, with, a, shackle, on, its, sail, end, other, maritime, examples, of, lines, include, anchor, line, mooring, line, fishing, line, marline, common, items, include, clothesline, and, a, chalk, line, in, some, marine, uses, the, term, rope, is, retained, such, as, man, rope, bolt, rope, and, bell, rope
