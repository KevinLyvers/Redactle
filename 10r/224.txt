sewage, treatment, or, domestic, wastewater, treatment, municipal, wastewater, treatment, is, a, type, of, wastewater, treatment, which, aims, to, remove, contaminants, from, sewage, to, produce, an, effluent, that, is, suitable, to, discharge, to, the, surrounding, environment, or, an, intended, reuse, application, thereby, preventing, water, pollution, from, raw, sewage, discharges, sewage, contains, wastewater, from, households, and, businesses, and, possibly, pre, treated, industrial, wastewater, there, are, a, high, number, of, sewage, treatment, processes, to, choose, from, these, can, range, from, decentralized, systems, including, on, site, treatment, systems, to, large, centralized, systems, involving, a, network, of, pipes, and, pump, stations, called, sewerage, which, convey, the, sewage, to, a, treatment, plant, for, cities, that, have, a, combined, sewer, the, sewers, will, also, carry, urban, runoff, stormwater, to, the, sewage, treatment, plant, sewage, treatment, often, involves, two, main, stages, called, primary, and, secondary, treatment, while, advanced, treatment, also, incorporates, a, tertiary, treatment, stage, with, polishing, processes, and, nutrient, removal, secondary, treatment, can, reduce, organic, matter, measured, as, biological, oxygen, demand, from, sewage, using, aerobic, or, anaerobic, biological, processes, a, so, called, quarternary, treatment, step, sometimes, referred, to, as, advanced, treatment, can, also, be, added, for, the, removal, of, organic, micropollutants, such, as, pharmaceuticals, this, has, been, implemented, in, full, scale, for, example, in, sweden, a, large, number, of, sewage, treatment, technologies, have, been, developed, mostly, using, biological, treatment, processes, design, engineers, and, decision, makers, need, to, take, into, account, technical, and, economical, criteria, of, each, alternative, when, choosing, a, suitable, technology, 215, often, the, main, criteria, for, selection, are, desired, effluent, quality, expected, construction, and, operating, costs, availability, of, land, energy, requirements, and, sustainability, aspects, in, developing, countries, and, in, rural, areas, with, low, population, densities, sewage, is, often, treated, by, various, on, site, sanitation, systems, and, not, conveyed, in, sewers, these, systems, include, septic, tanks, connected, to, drain, fields, on, site, sewage, systems, oss, vermifilter, systems, and, many, more, on, the, other, hand, advanced, and, relatively, expensive, sewage, treatment, plants, may, include, tertiary, treatment, with, disinfection, and, possibly, even, a, fourth, treatment, stage, to, remove, micropollutants, at, the, global, level, an, estimated, 52, of, sewage, is, treated, however, sewage, treatment, rates, are, highly, unequal, for, different, countries, around, the, world, for, example, while, high, income, countries, treat, approximately, 74, of, their, sewage, developing, countries, treat, an, average, of, just, 4, 2, the, treatment, of, sewage, is, part, of, the, field, of, sanitation, sanitation, also, includes, the, management, of, human, waste, and, solid, waste, as, well, as, stormwater, drainage, management, the, term, sewage, treatment, plant, is, often, used, interchangeably, with, the, term, wastewater, treatment, plant, the, term, sewage, treatment, plant, stp, or, sewage, treatment, works, is, nowadays, often, replaced, with, the, term, wastewater, treatment, plant, wwtp, strictly, speaking, the, latter, is, a, broader, term, that, can, also, refer, to, industrial, wastewater, treatment, the, terms, water, recycling, center, or, water, reclamation, plants, are, also, in, use, as, synonyms, the, overall, aim, of, treating, sewage, is, to, produce, an, effluent, that, can, be, discharged, to, the, environment, while, causing, as, little, water, pollution, as, possible, or, to, produce, an, effluent, that, can, be, reused, in, a, useful, manner, this, is, achieved, by, removing, contaminants, from, the, sewage, it, is, a, form, of, waste, management, with, regards, to, biological, treatment, of, sewage, the, treatment, objectives, can, include, various, degrees, of, the, following, to, transform, or, remove, organic, matter, nutrients, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, pathogenic, organisms, and, specific, trace, organic, constituents, micropollutants, 548, some, types, of, sewage, treatment, produce, sewage, sludge, which, can, be, treated, before, safe, disposal, or, reuse, under, certain, circumstances, the, treated, sewage, sludge, might, be, termed, biosolids, and, can, be, used, as, a, fertilizer, typical, values, for, physical, chemical, characteristics, of, raw, sewage, in, developing, countries, have, been, published, as, follows, 180, g, person, d, for, total, solids, or, 1100, mg, l, when, expressed, as, a, concentration, 50, g, person, d, for, bod, 300, mg, l, 100, g, person, d, for, cod, 600, mg, l, 8, g, person, d, for, total, nitrogen, 45, mg, l, 4, 5, g, person, d, for, ammonia, n, 25, mg, l, and, 1, 0, g, person, d, for, total, phosphorus, 7, mg, l, 57, the, typical, ranges, for, these, values, are, 120, 220, g, person, d, for, total, solids, or, 700, 1350, mg, l, when, expressed, as, a, concentration, 40, 60, g, person, d, for, bod, 250, 400, mg, l, 80, 120, g, person, d, for, cod, 450, 800, mg, l, 6, 10, g, person, d, for, total, nitrogen, 35, 60, mg, l, 3, 5, 6, g, person, d, for, ammonia, n, 20, 35, mg, l, and, 0, 7, 2, 5, g, person, d, for, total, phosphorus, 4, 15, mg, l, 57, sewerage, or, sewage, system, is, the, infrastructure, that, conveys, sewage, or, surface, runoff, stormwater, meltwater, rainwater, using, sewers, it, encompasses, components, such, as, receiving, drains, manholes, pumping, stations, storm, overflows, and, screening, chambers, of, the, combined, sewer, or, sanitary, sewer, sewerage, ends, at, the, entry, to, a, sewage, treatment, plant, or, at, the, point, of, discharge, into, the, environment, it, is, the, system, of, pipes, chambers, manholes, or, inspection, chamber, etc, that, conveys, the, sewage, or, storm, water, sewage, can, be, treated, close, to, where, the, sewage, is, created, which, may, be, called, a, decentralized, system, or, even, an, on, site, system, on, site, sewage, facility, septic, tanks, etc, alternatively, sewage, can, be, collected, and, transported, by, a, network, of, pipes, and, pump, stations, to, a, municipal, treatment, plant, this, is, called, a, centralized, system, see, also, sewerage, and, pipes, and, infrastructure, a, large, number, of, sewage, treatment, technologies, have, been, developed, mostly, using, biological, treatment, processes, see, list, of, wastewater, treatment, technologies, very, broadly, they, can, be, grouped, into, high, tech, high, cost, versus, low, tech, low, cost, options, although, some, technologies, might, fall, into, either, category, other, grouping, classifications, are, intensive, or, mechanized, systems, more, compact, and, frequently, employing, high, tech, options, versus, extensive, or, natural, or, nature, based, systems, usually, using, natural, treatment, processes, and, occupying, larger, areas, systems, this, classification, may, be, sometimes, oversimplified, because, a, treatment, plant, may, involve, a, combination, of, processes, and, the, interpretation, of, the, concepts, of, high, tech, and, low, tech, intensive, and, extensive, mechanized, and, natural, processes, may, vary, from, place, to, place, examples, for, more, low, tech, often, less, expensive, sewage, treatment, systems, are, shown, below, they, often, use, little, or, no, energy, some, of, these, systems, do, not, provide, a, high, level, of, treatment, or, only, treat, part, of, the, sewage, for, example, only, the, toilet, wastewater, or, they, only, provide, pre, treatment, like, septic, tanks, on, the, other, hand, some, systems, are, capable, of, providing, a, good, performance, satisfactory, for, several, applications, many, of, these, systems, are, based, on, natural, treatment, processes, requiring, large, areas, while, others, are, more, compact, in, most, cases, they, are, used, in, rural, areas, or, in, small, to, medium, sized, communities, for, example, waste, stabilization, ponds, are, a, low, cost, treatment, option, with, practically, no, energy, requirements, but, they, require, a, lot, of, land, 236, due, to, their, technical, simplicity, most, of, the, savings, compared, with, high, tech, systems, are, in, terms, of, operation, and, maintenance, costs, 220, 243, examples, for, systems, that, can, provide, full, or, partial, treatment, for, toilet, wastewater, only, examples, for, more, high, tech, intensive, or, mechanized, often, relatively, expensive, sewage, treatment, systems, are, listed, below, some, of, them, are, energy, intensive, as, well, many, of, them, provide, a, very, high, level, of, treatment, for, example, broadly, speaking, the, activated, sludge, process, achieves, a, high, effluent, quality, but, is, relatively, expensive, and, energy, intensive, 239, there, are, other, process, options, which, may, be, classified, as, disposal, options, although, they, can, also, be, understood, as, basic, treatment, options, these, include, application, of, sludge, irrigation, soak, pit, leach, field, fish, pond, floating, plant, pond, water, disposal, groundwater, recharge, surface, disposal, and, storage, 138, the, application, of, sewage, to, land, is, both, a, type, of, treatment, and, a, type, of, final, disposal, 189, it, leads, to, groundwater, recharge, and, or, to, evapotranspiration, land, application, include, slow, rate, systems, rapid, infiltration, subsurface, infiltration, overland, flow, it, is, done, by, flooding, furrows, sprinkler, and, dripping, it, is, a, treatment, disposal, system, that, requires, a, large, amount, of, land, per, person, the, per, person, organic, matter, load, is, a, parameter, used, in, the, design, of, sewage, treatment, plants, this, concept, is, known, as, population, equivalent, pe, the, base, value, used, for, pe, can, vary, from, one, country, to, another, commonly, used, definitions, used, worldwide, are, 1, pe, equates, to, 60, gram, of, bod, per, person, per, day, and, it, also, equals, 200, liters, of, sewage, per, day, this, concept, is, also, used, as, a, comparison, parameter, to, express, the, strength, of, industrial, wastewater, compared, to, sewage, when, choosing, a, suitable, sewage, treatment, process, decision, makers, need, to, take, into, account, technical, and, economical, criteria, 215, therefore, each, analysis, is, site, specific, a, life, cycle, assessment, lca, can, be, used, and, criteria, or, weightings, are, attributed, to, the, various, aspects, this, makes, the, final, decision, subjective, to, some, extent, 216, a, range, of, publications, exist, to, help, with, technology, selection, 221, in, industrialized, countries, the, most, important, parameters, in, process, selection, are, typically, efficiency, reliability, and, space, requirements, in, developing, countries, they, might, be, different, and, the, focus, might, be, more, on, construction, and, operating, costs, as, well, as, process, simplicity, 218, choosing, the, most, suitable, treatment, process, is, complicated, and, requires, expert, inputs, often, in, the, form, of, feasibility, studies, this, is, because, the, main, important, factors, to, be, considered, when, evaluating, and, selecting, sewage, treatment, processes, are, numerous, they, include, process, applicability, applicable, flow, acceptable, flow, variation, influent, characteristics, inhibiting, or, refractory, compounds, climatic, aspects, process, kinetics, and, reactor, hydraulics, performance, treatment, residuals, sludge, processing, environmental, constraints, requirements, for, chemical, products, energy, and, other, resources, requirements, for, personnel, operating, and, maintenance, ancillary, processes, reliability, complexity, compatibility, area, availability, 219, with, regards, to, environmental, impacts, of, sewage, treatment, plants, the, following, aspects, are, included, in, the, selection, process, odors, vector, attraction, sludge, transportation, sanitary, risks, air, contamination, soil, and, subsoil, contamination, surface, water, pollution, or, groundwater, contamination, devaluation, of, nearby, areas, inconvenience, to, the, nearby, population, 220, odors, emitted, by, sewage, treatment, are, typically, an, indication, of, an, anaerobic, or, septic, condition, early, stages, of, processing, will, tend, to, produce, foul, smelling, gases, with, hydrogen, sulfide, being, most, common, in, generating, complaints, large, process, plants, in, urban, areas, will, often, treat, the, odors, with, carbon, reactors, a, contact, media, with, bio, slimes, small, doses, of, chlorine, or, circulating, fluids, to, biologically, capture, and, metabolize, the, noxious, gases, other, methods, of, odor, control, exist, including, addition, of, iron, salts, hydrogen, peroxide, calcium, nitrate, etc, to, manage, hydrogen, sulfide, levels, the, energy, requirements, vary, with, type, of, treatment, process, as, well, as, sewage, strength, for, example, constructed, wetlands, and, stabilization, ponds, have, low, energy, requirements, in, comparison, the, activated, sludge, process, has, a, high, energy, consumption, because, it, includes, an, aeration, step, some, sewage, treatment, plants, produce, biogas, from, their, sewage, sludge, treatment, process, by, using, a, process, called, anaerobic, digestion, this, process, can, produce, enough, energy, to, meet, most, of, the, energy, needs, of, the, sewage, treatment, plant, itself, 1505, for, activated, sludge, treatment, plants, in, the, united, states, around, 30, percent, of, the, annual, operating, costs, is, usually, required, for, energy, 1703, most, of, this, electricity, is, used, for, aeration, pumping, systems, and, equipment, for, the, dewatering, and, drying, of, sewage, sludge, advanced, sewage, treatment, plants, e, g, for, nutrient, removal, require, more, energy, than, plants, that, only, achieve, primary, or, secondary, treatment, 1704, small, rural, plants, using, trickling, filters, may, operate, with, no, net, energy, requirements, the, whole, process, being, driven, by, gravitational, flow, including, tipping, bucket, flow, distribution, and, the, desludging, of, settlement, tanks, to, drying, beds, this, is, usually, only, practical, in, hilly, terrain, and, in, areas, where, the, treatment, plant, is, relatively, remote, from, housing, because, of, the, difficulty, in, managing, odors, in, highly, regulated, developed, countries, industrial, wastewater, usually, receives, at, least, pretreatment, if, not, full, treatment, at, the, factories, themselves, to, reduce, the, pollutant, load, before, discharge, to, the, sewer, the, pretreatment, has, the, following, two, main, aims, firstly, to, prevent, toxic, or, inhibitory, compounds, entering, the, biological, stage, of, the, sewage, treatment, plant, and, reduce, its, efficiency, and, secondly, to, avoid, toxic, compounds, from, accumulating, in, the, produced, sewage, sludge, which, would, reduce, its, beneficial, reuse, options, some, industrial, wastewater, may, contain, pollutants, which, cannot, be, removed, by, sewage, treatment, plants, also, variable, flow, of, industrial, waste, associated, with, production, cycles, may, upset, the, population, dynamics, of, biological, treatment, units, urban, residents, in, many, parts, of, the, world, rely, on, on, site, sanitation, systems, without, sewers, such, as, septic, tanks, and, pit, latrines, and, fecal, sludge, management, in, these, cities, is, an, enormous, challenge, for, sewage, treatment, the, use, of, septic, tanks, and, other, on, site, sewage, facilities, ossf, is, widespread, in, some, rural, areas, for, example, serving, up, to, 20, percent, of, the, homes, in, the, u, s, sewage, treatment, often, involves, two, main, stages, called, primary, and, secondary, treatment, while, advanced, treatment, also, incorporates, a, tertiary, treatment, stage, with, polishing, processes, different, types, of, sewage, treatment, may, utilize, some, or, all, of, the, process, steps, listed, below, preliminary, treatment, sometimes, called, pretreatment, removes, coarse, materials, that, can, be, easily, collected, from, the, raw, sewage, before, they, damage, or, clog, the, pumps, and, sewage, lines, of, primary, treatment, clarifiers, the, influent, in, sewage, water, passes, through, a, bar, screen, to, remove, all, large, objects, like, cans, rags, sticks, plastic, packets, etc, carried, in, the, sewage, stream, this, is, most, commonly, done, with, an, automated, mechanically, raked, bar, screen, in, modern, plants, serving, large, populations, while, in, smaller, or, less, modern, plants, a, manually, cleaned, screen, may, be, used, the, raking, action, of, a, mechanical, bar, screen, is, typically, paced, according, to, the, accumulation, on, the, bar, screens, and, or, flow, rate, the, solids, are, collected, and, later, disposed, in, a, landfill, or, incinerated, bar, screens, or, mesh, screens, of, varying, sizes, may, be, used, to, optimize, solids, removal, if, gross, solids, are, not, removed, they, become, entrained, in, pipes, and, moving, parts, of, the, treatment, plant, and, can, cause, substantial, damage, and, inefficiency, in, the, process, 9, grit, consists, of, sand, gravel, rocks, and, other, heavy, materials, preliminary, treatment, may, include, a, sand, or, grit, removal, channel, or, chamber, where, the, velocity, of, the, incoming, sewage, is, reduced, to, allow, the, settlement, of, grit, grit, removal, is, necessary, to, 1, reduce, formation, of, deposits, in, primary, sedimentation, tanks, aeration, tanks, anaerobic, digesters, pipes, channels, etc, 2, reduce, the, frequency, of, tank, cleaning, caused, by, excessive, accumulation, of, grit, and, 3, protect, moving, mechanical, equipment, from, abrasion, and, accompanying, abnormal, wear, the, removal, of, grit, is, essential, for, equipment, with, closely, machined, metal, surfaces, such, as, comminutors, fine, screens, centrifuges, heat, exchangers, and, high, pressure, diaphragm, pumps, grit, chambers, come, in, three, types, horizontal, grit, chambers, aerated, grit, chambers, and, vortex, grit, chambers, vortex, grit, chambers, include, mechanically, induced, vortex, hydraulically, induced, vortex, and, multi, tray, vortex, separators, given, that, traditionally, grit, removal, systems, have, been, designed, to, remove, clean, inorganic, particles, that, are, greater, than, 0, 210, millimetres, 0, 0083, in, most, of, the, finer, grit, passes, through, the, grit, removal, flows, under, normal, conditions, during, periods, of, high, flow, deposited, grit, is, resuspended, and, the, quantity, of, grit, reaching, the, treatment, plant, increases, substantially, equalization, basins, can, be, used, to, achieve, flow, equalization, this, is, especially, useful, for, combined, sewer, systems, which, produce, peak, dry, weather, flows, or, peak, wet, weather, flows, that, are, much, higher, than, the, average, flows, 334, such, basins, can, improve, the, performance, of, the, biological, treatment, processes, and, the, secondary, clarifiers, 334, disadvantages, include, the, basins, capital, cost, and, space, requirements, basins, can, also, provide, a, place, to, temporarily, hold, dilute, and, distribute, batch, discharges, of, toxic, or, high, strength, wastewater, which, might, otherwise, inhibit, biological, secondary, treatment, such, was, wastewater, from, portable, toilets, or, fecal, sludge, that, is, brought, to, the, sewage, treatment, plant, in, vacuum, trucks, flow, equalization, basins, require, variable, discharge, control, typically, include, provisions, for, bypass, and, cleaning, and, may, also, include, aerators, and, odor, control, in, some, larger, plants, fat, and, grease, are, removed, by, passing, the, sewage, through, a, small, tank, where, skimmers, collect, the, fat, floating, on, the, surface, air, blowers, in, the, base, of, the, tank, may, also, be, used, to, help, recover, the, fat, as, a, froth, many, plants, however, use, primary, clarifiers, with, mechanical, surface, skimmers, for, fat, and, grease, removal, primary, treatment, is, the, removal, of, a, portion, of, the, suspended, solids, and, organic, matter, from, the, sewage, 11, it, consists, of, allowing, sewage, to, pass, slowly, through, a, basin, where, heavy, solids, can, settle, to, the, bottom, while, oil, grease, and, lighter, solids, float, to, the, surface, and, are, skimmed, off, these, basins, are, called, primary, sedimentation, tanks, or, primary, clarifiers, and, typically, have, a, hydraulic, retention, time, hrt, of, 1, 5, to, 2, 5, hours, 398, the, settled, and, floating, materials, are, removed, and, the, remaining, liquid, may, be, discharged, or, subjected, to, secondary, treatment, primary, settling, tanks, are, usually, equipped, with, mechanically, driven, scrapers, that, continually, drive, the, collected, sludge, towards, a, hopper, in, the, base, of, the, tank, where, it, is, pumped, to, sludge, treatment, facilities, 9, 11, sewage, treatment, plants, that, are, connected, to, a, combined, sewer, system, sometimes, have, a, bypass, arrangement, after, the, primary, treatment, unit, this, means, that, during, very, heavy, rainfall, events, the, secondary, and, tertiary, treatment, systems, can, be, bypassed, to, protect, them, from, hydraulic, overloading, and, the, mixture, of, sewage, and, storm, water, receives, primary, treatment, only, primary, sedimentation, tanks, remove, about, 50, 70, of, the, suspended, solids, and, 25, 40, of, the, biological, oxygen, demand, bod, 396, the, main, processes, involved, in, secondary, sewage, treatment, are, designed, to, remove, as, much, of, the, solid, material, as, possible, they, use, biological, processes, to, digest, and, remove, the, remaining, soluble, material, especially, the, organic, fraction, this, can, be, done, with, either, suspended, growth, or, biofilm, processes, the, microorganisms, that, feed, on, the, organic, matter, present, in, the, sewage, grow, and, multiply, constituting, the, biological, solids, or, biomass, these, grow, and, group, together, in, the, form, of, flocs, or, biofilms, and, in, some, specific, processes, as, granules, the, biological, floc, or, biofilm, and, remaining, fine, solids, form, a, sludge, which, can, be, settled, and, separated, after, separation, a, liquid, remains, that, is, almost, free, of, solids, and, with, a, greatly, reduced, concentration, of, pollutants, secondary, treatment, can, reduce, organic, matter, measured, as, biological, oxygen, demand, from, sewage, using, aerobic, or, anaerobic, processes, the, organisms, involved, in, these, processes, are, sensitive, to, the, presence, of, toxic, materials, although, these, are, not, expected, to, be, present, at, high, concentrations, in, typical, municipal, sewage, advanced, sewage, treatment, generally, involves, three, main, stages, called, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, treatment, but, may, also, include, intermediate, stages, and, final, polishing, processes, the, purpose, of, tertiary, treatment, also, called, advanced, treatment, is, to, provide, a, final, treatment, stage, to, further, improve, the, effluent, quality, before, it, is, discharged, to, the, receiving, water, body, or, reused, more, than, one, tertiary, treatment, process, may, be, used, at, any, treatment, plant, if, disinfection, is, practiced, it, is, always, the, final, process, it, is, also, called, effluent, polishing, tertiary, treatment, may, include, biological, nutrient, removal, alternatively, this, can, be, classified, as, secondary, treatment, disinfection, and, removal, of, micropollutants, such, as, environmental, persistent, pharmaceutical, pollutants, tertiary, treatment, is, sometimes, defined, as, anything, more, than, primary, and, secondary, treatment, in, order, to, allow, discharge, into, a, highly, sensitive, or, fragile, ecosystem, such, as, estuaries, low, flow, rivers, or, coral, reefs, treated, water, is, sometimes, disinfected, chemically, or, physically, for, example, by, lagoons, and, microfiltration, prior, to, discharge, into, a, stream, river, bay, lagoon, or, wetland, or, it, can, be, used, for, the, irrigation, of, a, golf, course, greenway, or, park, if, it, is, sufficiently, clean, it, can, also, be, used, for, groundwater, recharge, or, agricultural, purposes, sand, filtration, removes, much, of, the, residual, suspended, matter, 22, 23, filtration, over, activated, carbon, also, called, carbon, adsorption, removes, residual, toxins, 19, micro, filtration, or, synthetic, membranes, are, used, in, membrane, bioreactors, and, can, also, remove, pathogens, 854, settlement, and, further, biological, improvement, of, treated, sewage, may, be, achieved, through, storage, in, large, human, made, ponds, or, lagoons, these, lagoons, are, highly, aerobic, and, colonization, by, native, macrophytes, especially, reeds, is, often, encouraged, disinfection, of, treated, sewage, aims, to, kill, pathogens, disease, causing, microorganisms, prior, to, disposal, it, is, increasingly, effective, after, more, elements, of, the, foregoing, treatment, sequence, have, been, completed, 359, the, purpose, of, disinfection, in, the, treatment, of, sewage, is, to, substantially, reduce, the, number, of, pathogens, in, the, water, to, be, discharged, back, into, the, environment, or, to, be, reused, the, target, level, of, reduction, of, biological, contaminants, like, pathogens, is, often, regulated, by, the, presiding, governmental, authority, the, effectiveness, of, disinfection, depends, on, the, quality, of, the, water, being, treated, e, g, turbidity, ph, etc, the, type, of, disinfection, being, used, the, disinfectant, dosage, concentration, and, time, and, other, environmental, variables, water, with, high, turbidity, will, be, treated, less, successfully, since, solid, matter, can, shield, organisms, especially, from, ultraviolet, light, or, if, contact, times, are, low, generally, short, contact, times, low, doses, and, high, flows, all, militate, against, effective, disinfection, common, methods, of, disinfection, include, ozone, chlorine, ultraviolet, light, or, sodium, hypochlorite, 16, monochloramine, which, is, used, for, drinking, water, is, not, used, in, the, treatment, of, sewage, because, of, its, persistence, chlorination, remains, the, most, common, form, of, treated, sewage, disinfection, in, many, countries, due, to, its, low, cost, and, long, term, history, of, effectiveness, one, disadvantage, is, that, chlorination, of, residual, organic, material, can, generate, chlorinated, organic, compounds, that, may, be, carcinogenic, or, harmful, to, the, environment, residual, chlorine, or, chloramines, may, also, be, capable, of, chlorinating, organic, material, in, the, natural, aquatic, environment, further, because, residual, chlorine, is, toxic, to, aquatic, species, the, treated, effluent, must, also, be, chemically, dechlorinated, adding, to, the, complexity, and, cost, of, treatment, ultraviolet, uv, light, can, be, used, instead, of, chlorine, iodine, or, other, chemicals, because, no, chemicals, are, used, the, treated, water, has, no, adverse, effect, on, organisms, that, later, consume, it, as, may, be, the, case, with, other, methods, uv, radiation, causes, damage, to, the, genetic, structure, of, bacteria, viruses, and, other, pathogens, making, them, incapable, of, reproduction, the, key, disadvantages, of, uv, disinfection, are, the, need, for, frequent, lamp, maintenance, and, replacement, and, the, need, for, a, highly, treated, effluent, to, ensure, that, the, target, microorganisms, are, not, shielded, from, the, uv, radiation, i, e, any, solids, present, in, the, treated, effluent, may, protect, microorganisms, from, the, uv, light, in, many, countries, uv, light, is, becoming, the, most, common, means, of, disinfection, because, of, the, concerns, about, the, impacts, of, chlorine, in, chlorinating, residual, organics, in, the, treated, sewage, and, in, chlorinating, organics, in, the, receiving, water, as, with, uv, treatment, heat, sterilization, also, does, not, add, chemicals, to, the, water, being, treated, however, unlike, uv, heat, can, penetrate, liquids, that, are, not, transparent, heat, disinfection, can, also, penetrate, solid, materials, within, wastewater, sterilizing, their, contents, thermal, effluent, decontamination, systems, provide, low, resource, low, maintenance, effluent, decontamination, once, installed, ozone, o, 3, is, generated, by, passing, oxygen, o, 2, through, a, high, voltage, potential, resulting, in, a, third, oxygen, atom, becoming, attached, and, forming, o, 3, ozone, is, very, unstable, and, reactive, and, oxidizes, most, organic, material, it, comes, in, contact, with, thereby, destroying, many, pathogenic, microorganisms, ozone, is, considered, to, be, safer, than, chlorine, because, unlike, chlorine, which, has, to, be, stored, on, site, highly, poisonous, in, the, event, of, an, accidental, release, ozone, is, generated, on, site, as, needed, from, the, oxygen, in, the, ambient, air, ozonation, also, produces, fewer, disinfection, by, products, than, chlorination, a, disadvantage, of, ozone, disinfection, is, the, high, cost, of, the, ozone, generation, equipment, and, the, requirements, for, special, operators, ozone, sewage, treatment, requires, the, use, of, an, ozone, generator, which, decontaminates, the, water, as, ozone, bubbles, percolate, through, the, tank, membranes, can, also, be, effective, disinfectants, because, they, act, as, barriers, avoiding, the, passage, of, the, microorganisms, as, a, result, the, final, effluent, may, be, devoid, of, pathogenic, organisms, depending, on, the, type, of, membrane, used, this, principle, is, applied, in, membrane, bioreactors, sewage, may, contain, high, levels, of, the, nutrients, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, typical, values, for, nutrient, loads, per, person, and, nutrient, concentrations, in, raw, sewage, in, developing, countries, have, been, published, as, follows, 8, g, person, d, for, total, nitrogen, 45, mg, l, 4, 5, g, person, d, for, ammonia, n, 25, mg, l, and, 1, 0, g, person, d, for, total, phosphorus, 7, mg, l, 57, the, typical, ranges, for, these, values, are, 6, 10, g, person, d, for, total, nitrogen, 35, 60, mg, l, 3, 5, 6, g, person, d, for, ammonia, n, 20, 35, mg, l, and, 0, 7, 2, 5, g, person, d, for, total, phosphorus, 4, 15, mg, l, 57, excessive, release, to, the, environment, can, lead, to, nutrient, pollution, which, can, manifest, itself, in, eutrophication, this, process, can, lead, to, algal, blooms, a, rapid, growth, and, later, decay, in, the, population, of, algae, in, addition, to, causing, deoxygenation, some, algal, species, produce, toxins, that, contaminate, drinking, water, supplies, ammonia, nitrogen, in, the, form, of, free, ammonia, nh, 3, is, toxic, to, fish, ammonia, nitrogen, when, converted, to, nitrite, and, further, to, nitrate, in, a, water, body, in, the, process, of, nitrification, is, associated, with, the, consumption, of, dissolved, oxygen, nitrite, and, nitrate, may, also, have, public, health, significance, if, concentrations, are, high, in, drinking, water, because, of, a, disease, called, metahemoglobinemia, 42, phosphorus, removal, is, important, as, phosphorus, is, a, limiting, nutrient, for, algae, growth, in, many, fresh, water, systems, therefore, an, excess, of, phosphorus, can, lead, to, eutrophication, it, is, also, particularly, important, for, water, reuse, systems, where, high, phosphorus, concentrations, may, lead, to, fouling, of, downstream, equipment, such, as, reverse, osmosis, a, range, of, treatment, processes, are, available, to, remove, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, biological, nutrient, removal, bnr, is, regarded, by, some, as, a, type, of, secondary, treatment, process, and, by, others, as, a, tertiary, or, advanced, treatment, process, nitrogen, is, removed, through, the, biological, oxidation, of, nitrogen, from, ammonia, to, nitrate, nitrification, followed, by, denitrification, the, reduction, of, nitrate, to, nitrogen, gas, nitrogen, gas, is, released, to, the, atmosphere, and, thus, removed, from, the, water, nitrification, itself, is, a, two, step, aerobic, process, each, step, facilitated, by, a, different, type, of, bacteria, the, oxidation, of, ammonia, nh, 4, to, nitrite, no, 2, is, most, often, facilitated, by, bacteria, such, as, nitrosomonas, spp, nitroso, refers, to, the, formation, of, a, nitroso, functional, group, nitrite, oxidation, to, nitrate, no, 3, though, traditionally, believed, to, be, facilitated, by, nitrobacter, spp, nitro, referring, the, formation, of, a, nitro, functional, group, is, now, known, to, be, facilitated, in, the, environment, predominantly, by, nitrospira, spp, denitrification, requires, anoxic, conditions, to, encourage, the, appropriate, biological, communities, to, form, anoxic, conditions, refers, to, a, situation, where, oxygen, is, absent, but, nitrate, is, present, denitrification, is, facilitated, by, a, wide, diversity, of, bacteria, the, activated, sludge, process, sand, filters, waste, stabilization, ponds, constructed, wetlands, and, other, processes, can, all, be, used, to, reduce, nitrogen, 17, 18, since, denitrification, is, the, reduction, of, nitrate, to, dinitrogen, molecular, nitrogen, gas, an, electron, donor, is, needed, this, can, be, depending, on, the, wastewater, organic, matter, from, the, sewage, itself, sulfide, or, an, added, donor, like, methanol, the, sludge, in, the, anoxic, tanks, denitrification, tanks, must, be, mixed, well, mixture, of, recirculated, mixed, liquor, return, activated, sludge, and, raw, influent, e, g, by, using, submersible, mixers, in, order, to, achieve, the, desired, denitrification, over, time, different, treatment, configurations, for, activated, sludge, processes, have, evolved, to, achieve, high, levels, of, nitrogen, removal, an, initial, scheme, was, called, the, ludzack, ettinger, process, it, could, not, achieve, a, high, level, of, denitrification, 616, the, modified, ludzak, ettinger, process, mle, came, later, and, was, an, improvement, on, the, original, concept, it, recycles, mixed, liquor, from, the, discharge, end, of, the, aeration, tank, to, the, head, of, the, anoxic, tank, this, provides, nitrate, for, the, facultative, bacteria, 616, there, are, other, process, configurations, such, as, variations, of, the, bardenpho, process, 160, they, might, differ, in, the, placement, of, anoxic, tanks, e, g, before, and, after, the, aeration, tanks, studies, of, united, states, sewage, in, the, late, 1960s, estimated, mean, per, capita, contributions, of, 500, grams, 18, oz, in, urine, and, feces, 1, 000, grams, 35, oz, in, synthetic, detergents, and, lesser, variable, amounts, used, as, corrosion, and, scale, control, chemicals, in, water, supplies, source, control, via, alternative, detergent, formulations, has, subsequently, reduced, the, largest, contribution, but, naturally, the, phosphorus, content, of, urine, and, feces, remained, unchanged, phosphorus, can, be, removed, biologically, in, a, process, called, enhanced, biological, phosphorus, removal, in, this, process, specific, bacteria, called, polyphosphate, accumulating, organisms, paos, are, selectively, enriched, and, accumulate, large, quantities, of, phosphorus, within, their, cells, up, to, 20, percent, of, their, mass, 148, 155, phosphorus, removal, can, also, be, achieved, by, chemical, precipitation, usually, with, salts, of, iron, e, g, ferric, chloride, or, aluminum, e, g, alum, or, lime, 18, this, may, lead, to, a, higher, sludge, production, as, hydroxides, precipitate, and, the, added, chemicals, can, be, expensive, chemical, phosphorus, removal, requires, significantly, smaller, equipment, footprint, than, biological, removal, is, easier, to, operate, and, is, often, more, reliable, than, biological, phosphorus, removal, another, method, for, phosphorus, removal, is, to, use, granular, laterite, or, zeolite, some, systems, use, both, biological, phosphorus, removal, and, chemical, phosphorus, removal, the, chemical, phosphorus, removal, in, those, systems, may, be, used, as, a, backup, system, for, use, when, the, biological, phosphorus, removal, is, not, removing, enough, phosphorus, or, may, be, used, continuously, in, either, case, using, both, biological, and, chemical, phosphorus, removal, has, the, advantage, of, not, increasing, sludge, production, as, much, as, chemical, phosphorus, removal, on, its, own, with, the, disadvantage, of, the, increased, initial, cost, associated, with, installing, two, different, systems, once, removed, phosphorus, in, the, form, of, a, phosphate, rich, sewage, sludge, may, be, sent, to, landfill, or, used, as, fertilizer, in, admixture, with, other, digested, sewage, sludges, in, the, latter, case, the, treated, sewage, sludge, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, biosolids, 22, of, the, world, s, phosphorus, needs, could, be, satisfied, by, recycling, residential, wastewater, micropollutants, such, as, pharmaceuticals, ingredients, of, household, chemicals, chemicals, used, in, small, businesses, or, industries, environmental, persistent, pharmaceutical, pollutants, eppp, or, pesticides, may, not, be, eliminated, in, the, commonly, used, sewage, treatment, processes, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, treatment, and, therefore, lead, to, water, pollution, although, concentrations, of, those, substances, and, their, decomposition, products, are, quite, low, there, is, still, a, chance, of, harming, aquatic, organisms, for, pharmaceuticals, the, following, substances, have, been, identified, as, toxicologically, relevant, substances, with, endocrine, disrupting, effects, genotoxic, substances, and, substances, that, enhance, the, development, of, bacterial, resistances, they, mainly, belong, to, the, group, of, eppp, techniques, for, elimination, of, micropollutants, via, a, fourth, treatment, stage, during, sewage, treatment, are, implemented, in, germany, switzerland, sweden, and, the, netherlands, and, tests, are, ongoing, in, several, other, countries, such, process, steps, mainly, consist, of, activated, carbon, filters, that, adsorb, the, micropollutants, the, combination, of, advanced, oxidation, with, ozone, followed, by, granular, activated, carbon, gac, has, been, suggested, as, a, cost, effective, treatment, combination, for, pharmaceutical, residues, for, a, full, reduction, of, microplasts, the, combination, of, ultrafiltration, followed, by, gac, has, been, suggested, also, the, use, of, enzymes, such, as, laccase, secreted, by, fungi, is, under, investigation, microbial, biofuel, cells, are, investigated, for, their, property, to, treat, organic, matter, in, sewage, to, reduce, pharmaceuticals, in, water, bodies, source, control, measures, are, also, under, investigation, such, as, innovations, in, drug, development, or, more, responsible, handling, of, drugs, in, the, us, the, national, take, back, initiative, is, a, voluntary, program, with, the, general, public, encouraging, people, to, return, excess, or, expired, drugs, and, avoid, flushing, them, to, the, sewage, system, sewage, sludge, treatment, describes, the, processes, used, to, manage, and, dispose, of, sewage, sludge, produced, during, sewage, treatment, sludge, treatment, is, focused, on, reducing, sludge, weight, and, volume, to, reduce, transportation, and, disposal, costs, and, on, reducing, potential, health, risks, of, disposal, options, water, removal, is, the, primary, means, of, weight, and, volume, reduction, while, pathogen, destruction, is, frequently, accomplished, through, heating, during, thermophilic, digestion, composting, or, incineration, the, choice, of, a, sludge, treatment, method, depends, on, the, volume, of, sludge, generated, and, comparison, of, treatment, costs, required, for, available, disposal, options, air, drying, and, composting, may, be, attractive, to, rural, communities, while, limited, land, availability, may, make, aerobic, digestion, and, mechanical, dewatering, preferable, for, cities, and, economies, of, scale, may, encourage, energy, recovery, alternatives, in, metropolitan, areas, sludge, is, mostly, water, with, some, amounts, of, solid, material, removed, from, liquid, sewage, primary, sludge, includes, settleable, solids, removed, during, primary, treatment, in, primary, clarifiers, secondary, sludge, is, sludge, separated, in, secondary, clarifiers, that, are, used, in, secondary, treatment, bioreactors, or, processes, using, inorganic, oxidizing, agents, in, intensive, sewage, treatment, processes, the, sludge, produced, needs, to, be, removed, from, the, liquid, line, on, a, continuous, basis, because, the, volumes, of, the, tanks, in, the, liquid, line, have, insufficient, volume, to, store, sludge, this, is, done, in, order, to, keep, the, treatment, processes, compact, and, in, balance, production, of, sludge, approximately, equal, to, the, removal, of, sludge, the, sludge, removed, from, the, liquid, line, goes, to, the, sludge, treatment, line, aerobic, processes, such, as, the, activated, sludge, process, tend, to, produce, more, sludge, compared, with, anaerobic, processes, on, the, other, hand, in, extensive, natural, treatment, processes, such, as, ponds, and, constructed, wetlands, the, produced, sludge, remains, accumulated, in, the, treatment, units, liquid, line, and, is, only, removed, after, several, years, of, operation, sewage, treatment, plants, can, have, significant, effects, on, the, biotic, status, of, receiving, waters, and, can, cause, some, water, pollution, especially, if, the, treatment, process, used, is, only, basic, for, example, for, sewage, treatment, plants, without, nutrient, removal, eutrophication, of, receiving, water, bodies, can, be, a, problem, in, 2024, the, royal, academy, of, engineering, released, a, study, into, the, effects, wastewater, on, public, health, in, the, united, kingdom, the, study, gained, media, attention, with, comments, from, the, uks, leading, health, professionals, including, sir, chris, whitty, outlining, 15, recommendations, for, various, uk, bodies, to, dramatically, reduce, public, health, risks, by, increasing, the, water, quality, in, its, waterways, such, as, rivers, and, lakes, after, the, release, of, the, report, the, guardian, newspaper, interviewed, whitty, who, stated, that, improving, water, quality, and, sewage, treatment, should, be, a, high, level, of, importance, and, a, public, health, priority, he, compared, it, to, eradicating, cholera, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, country, following, improvements, to, the, sewage, treatment, network, the, study, also, identified, that, low, water, flows, in, rivers, saw, high, concentration, levels, of, sewage, as, well, as, times, of, flooding, or, heavy, rainfall, while, heavy, rainfall, had, always, been, associated, with, sewage, overflows, into, streams, and, rivers, the, british, media, went, as, far, to, warn, parents, of, the, dangers, of, paddling, in, shallow, rivers, during, warm, weather, whitty, s, comments, came, after, the, study, revealed, that, the, uk, was, experiencing, a, growth, in, the, number, of, people, that, were, using, coastal, and, inland, waters, recreationally, this, could, be, connected, to, a, growing, interest, in, activities, such, as, open, water, swimming, or, other, water, sports, despite, this, growth, in, recreation, poor, water, quality, meant, some, were, becoming, unwell, during, events, most, notably, the, 2024, paris, olympics, had, to, delay, numerous, swimming, focused, events, like, the, triathlon, due, to, high, levels, of, sewage, in, the, river, seine, increasingly, people, use, treated, or, even, untreated, sewage, for, irrigation, to, produce, crops, cities, provide, lucrative, markets, for, fresh, produce, so, are, attractive, to, farmers, because, agriculture, has, to, compete, for, increasingly, scarce, water, resources, with, industry, and, municipal, users, there, is, often, no, alternative, for, farmers, but, to, use, water, polluted, with, sewage, directly, to, water, their, crops, there, can, be, significant, health, hazards, related, to, using, water, loaded, with, pathogens, in, this, way, the, world, health, organization, developed, guidelines, for, safe, use, of, wastewater, in, 2006, they, advocate, a, multiple, barrier, approach, to, wastewater, use, where, farmers, are, encouraged, to, adopt, various, risk, reducing, behaviors, these, include, ceasing, irrigation, a, few, days, before, harvesting, to, allow, pathogens, to, die, off, in, the, sunlight, applying, water, carefully, so, it, does, not, contaminate, leaves, likely, to, be, eaten, raw, cleaning, vegetables, with, disinfectant, or, allowing, fecal, sludge, used, in, farming, to, dry, before, being, used, as, a, human, manure, before, the, 20th, century, in, europe, sewers, usually, discharged, into, a, body, of, water, such, as, a, river, lake, or, ocean, there, was, no, treatment, so, the, breakdown, of, the, human, waste, was, left, to, the, ecosystem, this, could, lead, to, satisfactory, results, if, the, assimilative, capacity, of, the, ecosystem, is, sufficient, which, is, nowadays, not, often, the, case, due, to, increasing, population, density, 78, today, the, situation, in, urban, areas, of, industrialized, countries, is, usually, that, sewers, route, their, contents, to, a, sewage, treatment, plant, rather, than, directly, to, a, body, of, water, in, many, developing, countries, however, the, bulk, of, municipal, and, industrial, wastewater, is, discharged, to, rivers, and, the, ocean, without, any, treatment, or, after, preliminary, treatment, or, primary, treatment, only, doing, so, can, lead, to, water, pollution, few, reliable, figures, exist, on, the, share, of, the, wastewater, collected, in, sewers, that, is, being, treated, in, the, world, a, global, estimate, by, undp, and, un, habitat, in, 2010, was, that, 90, of, all, wastewater, generated, is, released, into, the, environment, untreated, a, more, recent, study, in, 2021, estimated, that, globally, about, 52, of, sewage, is, treated, however, sewage, treatment, rates, are, highly, unequal, for, different, countries, around, the, world, for, example, while, high, income, countries, treat, approximately, 74, of, their, sewage, developing, countries, treat, an, average, of, just, 4, 2, as, of, 2022, without, sufficient, treatment, more, than, 80, of, all, wastewater, generated, globally, is, released, into, the, environment, high, income, nations, treat, on, average, 70, of, the, wastewater, they, produce, according, to, un, water, only, 8, of, wastewater, produced, in, low, income, nations, receives, any, sort, of, treatment, the, joint, monitoring, programme, jmp, for, water, supply, and, sanitation, by, who, and, unicef, report, in, 2021, that, 82, of, people, with, sewer, connections, are, connected, to, sewage, treatment, plants, providing, at, least, secondary, treatment, 55, however, this, value, varies, widely, between, regions, for, example, in, europe, north, america, northern, africa, and, western, asia, a, total, of, 31, countries, had, universal, 99, wastewater, treatment, however, in, albania, bermuda, north, macedonia, and, serbia, less, than, 50, of, sewered, wastewater, received, secondary, or, better, treatment, and, in, algeria, lebanon, and, libya, the, value, was, less, than, 20, of, sewered, wastewater, that, was, being, treated, the, report, also, found, that, globally, 594, million, people, have, sewer, connections, that, don, t, receive, sufficient, treatment, many, more, are, connected, to, wastewater, treatment, plants, that, do, not, provide, effective, treatment, or, comply, with, effluent, requirements, 55, sustainable, development, goal, 6, has, a, target, 6, 3, which, is, formulated, as, follows, by, 2030, improve, water, quality, by, reducing, pollution, eliminating, dumping, and, minimizing, release, of, hazardous, chemicals, and, materials, halving, the, proportion, of, untreated, wastewater, and, substantially, increasing, recycling, and, safe, reuse, globally, the, corresponding, indicator, 6, 3, 1, is, the, proportion, of, wastewater, safely, treated, it, is, anticipated, that, wastewater, production, would, rise, by, 24, by, 2030, and, by, 51, by, 2050, data, in, 2020, showed, that, there, is, still, too, much, uncollected, household, wastewater, only, 66, of, all, household, wastewater, flows, were, collected, at, treatment, facilities, in, 2020, this, is, determined, from, data, from, 128, countries, 17, based, on, data, from, 42, countries, in, 2015, the, report, stated, that, 32, per, cent, of, all, wastewater, flows, generated, from, point, sources, received, at, least, some, treatment, 17, for, sewage, that, has, indeed, been, collected, at, centralized, sewage, treatment, plants, about, 79, went, on, to, be, safely, treated, in, 2020, 18, the, history, of, sewage, treatment, had, the, following, developments, it, began, with, land, application, sewage, farms, in, the, 1840s, in, england, followed, by, chemical, treatment, and, sedimentation, of, sewage, in, tanks, then, biological, treatment, the, late, 19th, century, which, led, to, the, development, of, the, activated, sludge, process, starting, in, 1912, it, was, not, until, the, late, 19th, century, that, it, became, possible, to, treat, the, sewage, by, biologically, decomposing, the, organic, components, through, the, use, of, microorganisms, and, removing, the, pollutants, land, treatment, was, also, steadily, becoming, less, feasible, as, cities, grew, and, the, volume, of, sewage, produced, could, no, longer, be, absorbed, by, the, farmland, on, the, outskirts, edward, frankland, conducted, experiments, at, the, sewage, farm, in, croydon, england, during, the, 1870s, and, was, able, to, demonstrate, that, filtration, of, sewage, through, porous, gravel, produced, a, nitrified, effluent, the, ammonia, was, converted, into, nitrate, and, that, the, filter, remained, unclogged, over, long, periods, of, time, this, established, the, then, revolutionary, possibility, of, biological, treatment, of, sewage, using, a, contact, bed, to, oxidize, the, waste, this, concept, was, taken, up, by, the, chief, chemist, for, the, london, metropolitan, board, of, works, william, libdin, in, 1887, in, most, countries, sewage, collection, and, treatment, are, subject, to, local, and, national, regulations, and, standards, in, the, european, union, 0, 8, of, total, energy, consumption, goes, to, wastewater, treatment, facilities, the, european, union, needs, to, make, extra, investments, of, 90, billion, in, the, water, and, waste, sector, to, meet, its, 2030, climate, and, energy, goals, in, october, 2021, british, members, of, parliament, voted, to, continue, allowing, untreated, sewage, from, combined, sewer, overflows, to, be, released, into, waterways, the, delhi, jal, board, djb, is, currently, operating, on, the, construction, of, the, largest, sewage, treatment, plant, in, india, it, will, be, operational, by, the, end, of, 2022, with, an, estimated, capacity, of, 564, mld, it, is, supposed, to, solve, the, existing, situation, wherein, untreated, sewage, water, is, being, discharged, directly, into, the, river, yamuna, in, libya, municipal, wastewater, treatment, is, managed, by, the, general, company, for, water, and, wastewater, in, libya, which, falls, within, the, competence, of, the, housing, and, utilities, government, ministry, there, are, approximately, 200, sewage, treatment, plants, across, the, nation, but, few, plants, are, functioning, in, fact, the, 36, larger, plants, are, in, the, major, cities, however, only, nine, of, them, are, operational, and, the, rest, of, them, are, under, repair
