a, dairy, is, a, place, where, milk, is, stored, and, where, butter, cheese, and, other, dairy, products, are, made, or, a, place, where, those, products, are, sold, 325, 284, it, may, be, a, room, a, building, or, a, larger, establishment, 284, in, the, united, states, the, word, may, also, describe, a, dairy, farm, or, the, part, of, a, mixed, farm, dedicated, to, milk, for, human, consumption, 284, whether, from, cows, buffaloes, goats, yaks, sheep, horses, or, camels, the, attributive, dairy, describes, milk, based, products, derivatives, and, processes, and, the, animals, and, workers, involved, in, their, production, for, example, dairyman, dairymaid, dairy, cattle, or, dairy, goat, a, dairy, farm, produces, milk, and, a, dairy, factory, processes, it, into, a, variety, of, dairy, products, these, establishments, constitute, the, global, dairy, industry, part, of, the, food, industry, the, word, dairy, comes, from, an, old, english, word, for, female, servant, as, historically, milking, was, done, by, dairymaids, terminology, differs, between, countries, in, the, united, states, for, example, an, entire, dairy, farm, is, commonly, called, a, dairy, the, building, or, farm, area, where, milk, is, harvested, from, the, cow, is, often, called, a, milking, parlor, or, parlor, except, in, the, case, of, smaller, dairies, where, cows, are, often, put, on, pasture, and, usually, milked, in, stanchion, barns, the, farm, area, where, milk, is, stored, in, bulk, tanks, is, known, as, the, farm, s, milk, house, milk, is, then, hauled, usually, by, truck, to, a, dairy, plant, also, referred, to, as, a, dairy, where, raw, milk, is, further, processed, and, prepared, for, commercial, sale, of, dairy, products, in, new, zealand, farm, areas, for, milk, harvesting, are, also, called, milking, parlours, and, are, historically, known, as, milking, sheds, as, in, the, united, states, sometimes, milking, sheds, are, referred, to, by, their, type, such, as, herring, bone, shed, or, pit, parlour, parlour, design, has, evolved, from, simple, barns, or, sheds, to, large, rotary, structures, in, which, the, workflow, throughput, of, cows, is, very, efficiently, handled, in, some, countries, especially, those, with, small, numbers, of, animals, being, milked, the, farm, may, perform, the, functions, of, a, dairy, plant, processing, their, own, milk, into, saleable, dairy, products, such, as, butter, cheese, or, yogurt, this, on, site, processing, is, a, traditional, method, of, producing, specialist, milk, products, common, in, europe, in, the, united, states, a, dairy, can, also, be, a, place, that, processes, distributes, and, sells, dairy, products, or, a, room, building, or, establishment, where, milk, is, stored, and, processed, into, milk, products, such, as, butter, or, cheese, in, new, zealand, english, the, singular, use, of, the, word, dairy, almost, exclusively, refers, to, a, corner, shop, or, superette, this, usage, is, historical, as, such, shops, were, a, common, place, for, the, public, to, buy, milk, products, milk, producing, animals, have, been, domesticated, for, thousands, of, years, initially, they, were, part, of, the, subsistence, farming, that, nomads, engaged, in, as, the, community, moved, about, the, country, their, animals, accompanied, them, protecting, and, feeding, the, animals, were, a, major, part, of, the, symbiotic, relationship, between, the, animals, and, the, herders, in, the, more, recent, past, people, in, agricultural, societies, owned, dairy, animals, that, they, milked, for, domestic, and, local, village, consumption, a, typical, example, of, a, cottage, industry, the, animals, might, serve, multiple, purposes, for, example, as, a, draught, animal, for, pulling, a, plow, as, a, youngster, and, at, the, end, of, its, useful, life, as, meat, in, this, case, the, animals, were, normally, milked, by, hand, and, the, herd, size, was, quite, small, so, that, all, of, the, animals, could, be, milked, in, less, than, an, hour, about, 10, per, milker, these, tasks, were, performed, by, a, dairymaid, dairywoman, or, dairyman, the, word, dairy, harkens, back, to, middle, english, dayerie, deyerie, from, deye, female, servant, or, dairymaid, and, further, back, to, old, english, d, ge, kneader, of, bread, with, industrialisation, and, urbanisation, the, supply, of, milk, became, a, commercial, industry, with, specialised, breeds, of, cattle, being, developed, for, dairy, as, distinct, from, beef, or, draught, animals, initially, more, people, were, employed, as, milkers, but, it, soon, turned, to, mechanisation, with, machines, designed, to, do, the, milking, historically, the, milking, and, the, processing, took, place, close, together, in, space, and, time, on, a, dairy, farm, people, milked, the, animals, by, hand, on, farms, where, only, small, numbers, are, kept, hand, milking, may, still, be, practised, hand, milking, is, accomplished, by, grasping, the, teats, often, pronounced, tit, or, tits, in, the, hand, and, expressing, milk, either, by, squeezing, the, fingers, progressively, from, the, udder, end, to, the, tip, or, by, squeezing, the, teat, between, thumb, and, index, finger, then, moving, the, hand, downward, from, udder, towards, the, end, of, the, teat, the, action, of, the, hand, or, fingers, is, designed, to, close, off, the, milk, duct, at, the, udder, upper, end, and, by, the, movement, of, the, fingers, close, the, duct, progressively, to, the, tip, to, express, the, trapped, milk, each, half, or, quarter, of, the, udder, is, emptied, one, milk, duct, capacity, at, a, time, the, stripping, action, is, repeated, using, both, hands, for, speed, both, methods, result, in, the, milk, that, was, trapped, in, the, milk, duct, being, squirted, out, the, end, into, a, bucket, that, is, supported, between, the, knees, or, rests, on, the, ground, of, the, milker, who, usually, sits, on, a, low, stool, traditionally, the, cow, or, cows, would, stand, in, the, field, or, paddock, while, being, milked, young, stock, heifers, would, have, to, be, trained, to, remain, still, to, be, milked, in, many, countries, the, cows, were, tethered, to, a, post, and, milked, while, most, countries, produce, their, own, milk, products, the, structure, of, the, dairy, industry, varies, in, different, parts, of, the, world, in, major, milk, producing, countries, most, milk, is, distributed, through, whole, sale, markets, in, ireland, and, australia, for, example, farmers, co, operatives, own, many, of, the, large, scale, processors, while, in, the, united, states, many, farmers, and, processors, do, business, through, individual, contracts, in, the, united, states, the, country, s, 196, farmers, cooperatives, sold, 86, of, milk, in, the, u, s, in, 2002, with, five, cooperatives, accounting, for, half, that, this, was, down, from, 2, 300, cooperatives, in, the, 1940s, in, developing, countries, the, past, practice, of, farmers, marketing, milk, in, their, own, neighbourhoods, is, changing, rapidly, notable, developments, include, considerable, foreign, investment, in, the, dairy, industry, and, a, growing, role, for, dairy, cooperatives, output, of, milk, is, growing, rapidly, in, such, countries, and, presents, a, major, source, of, income, growth, for, many, farmers, as, in, many, other, branches, of, the, food, industry, dairy, processing, in, the, major, dairy, producing, countries, has, become, increasingly, concentrated, with, fewer, but, larger, and, more, efficient, plants, operated, by, fewer, workers, this, is, notably, the, case, in, the, united, states, europe, australia, and, new, zealand, in, 2009, charges, of, antitrust, violations, have, been, made, against, major, dairy, industry, players, in, the, united, states, which, critics, call, big, milk, another, round, of, price, fixing, charges, was, settled, in, 2016, government, intervention, in, milk, markets, was, common, in, the, 20th, century, a, limited, antitrust, exemption, was, created, for, u, s, dairy, cooperatives, by, the, capper, volstead, act, of, 1922, in, the, 1930s, some, u, s, states, adopted, price, controls, and, federal, milk, marketing, orders, started, under, the, agricultural, marketing, agreement, act, of, 1937, and, continue, in, the, 2000s, the, federal, milk, price, support, program, began, in, 1949, the, northeast, dairy, compact, regulated, wholesale, milk, prices, in, new, england, from, 1997, to, 2001, plants, producing, liquid, milk, and, products, with, short, shelf, life, such, as, yogurts, creams, and, soft, cheeses, tend, to, be, located, on, the, outskirts, of, urban, centres, close, to, consumer, markets, plants, manufacturing, items, with, longer, shelf, life, such, as, butter, milk, powders, cheese, and, whey, powders, tend, to, be, situated, in, rural, areas, closer, to, the, milk, supply, most, large, processing, plants, tend, to, specialise, in, a, limited, range, of, products, exceptionally, however, large, plants, producing, a, wide, range, of, products, are, still, common, in, eastern, europe, a, holdover, from, the, former, centralised, supply, driven, concept, of, the, market, under, communist, governments, as, processing, plants, grow, fewer, and, larger, they, tend, to, acquire, bigger, more, automated, and, more, efficient, equipment, while, this, technological, tendency, keeps, manufacturing, costs, lower, the, need, for, long, distance, transportation, often, increases, the, environmental, impact, milk, production, is, irregular, depending, on, cow, biology, producers, must, adjust, the, mix, of, milk, which, is, sold, in, liquid, form, vs, processed, foods, such, as, butter, and, cheese, depending, on, changing, supply, and, demand, in, the, european, union, milk, supply, contracts, are, regulated, by, article, 148, of, regulation, 1308, 2013, establishing, a, common, organisation, of, the, markets, in, agricultural, products, and, repealing, council, regulations, eec, no, 922, 72, eec, no, 234, 79, ec, no, 1037, 2001, and, ec, no, 1234, 2007, which, permits, member, states, to, create, a, requirement, for, the, supply, of, milk, from, a, farmer, to, a, raw, milk, processor, to, be, backed, by, a, written, contract, or, to, ensure, that, the, first, purchaser, of, milk, to, make, a, written, offer, to, the, farmer, although, in, this, case, the, farmer, may, not, be, required, to, enter, into, a, contract, thirteen, eu, member, states, including, france, and, spain, have, introduced, laws, on, compulsory, or, mandatory, written, milk, contracts, mwc, s, between, farmers, and, processors, the, scottish, government, published, an, analysis, of, the, dairy, supply, chain, and, the, application, of, mandatory, written, contracts, across, the, european, union, in, 2019, to, evaluate, the, impact, of, the, contracts, where, they, have, been, adopted, in, the, uk, a, voluntary, code, of, best, practice, on, contractual, relationships, in, the, dairy, sector, was, agreed, by, industry, during, 2012, this, set, out, minimum, standards, of, good, practice, for, contracts, between, producers, and, purchasers, during, 2020, the, uk, government, has, undertaken, a, consultation, exercise, to, determine, which, contractual, measures, if, any, would, improve, the, resilience, of, the, dairy, industry, for, the, future, the, australian, government, has, also, introduced, a, mandatory, dairy, code, of, conduct, when, it, became, necessary, to, milk, larger, cows, the, cows, would, be, brought, to, a, shed, or, barn, that, was, set, up, with, stalls, milking, stalls, where, the, cows, could, be, confined, their, whole, life, while, they, were, milked, one, person, could, milk, more, cows, this, way, as, many, as, 20, for, a, skilled, worker, but, having, cows, standing, about, in, the, yard, and, shed, waiting, to, be, milked, is, not, good, for, the, cow, as, she, needs, as, much, time, in, the, paddock, grazing, as, is, possible, it, is, usual, to, restrict, the, twice, daily, milking, to, a, maximum, of, an, hour, and, a, half, each, time, it, makes, no, difference, whether, one, milks, 10, or, 1000, cows, the, milking, time, should, not, exceed, a, total, of, about, three, hours, each, day, for, any, cow, as, they, should, be, in, stalls, and, laying, down, as, long, as, possible, to, increase, comfort, which, will, in, turn, aid, in, milk, production, a, cow, is, physically, milked, for, only, about, 10, minutes, a, day, depending, on, her, milk, letdown, time, and, the, number, of, milkings, per, day, as, herd, sizes, increased, there, was, more, need, to, have, efficient, milking, machines, sheds, milk, storage, facilities, vats, bulk, milk, transport, and, shed, cleaning, capabilities, and, the, means, of, getting, cows, from, paddock, to, shed, and, back, as, herd, numbers, increased, so, did, the, problems, of, animal, health, in, new, zealand, two, approaches, to, this, problem, have, been, used, the, first, was, improved, veterinary, medicines, and, the, government, regulation, of, the, medicines, that, the, farmer, could, use, the, other, was, the, creation, of, veterinary, clubs, where, groups, of, farmers, would, employ, a, veterinarian, vet, full, time, and, share, those, services, throughout, the, year, it, was, in, the, vet, s, interest, to, keep, the, animals, healthy, and, reduce, the, number, of, calls, from, farmers, rather, than, to, ensure, that, the, farmer, needed, to, call, for, service, and, pay, regularly, this, daily, milking, routine, goes, on, for, about, 300, to, 320, days, per, year, that, the, cow, stays, in, milk, some, small, herds, are, milked, once, a, day, for, about, the, last, 20, days, of, the, production, cycle, but, this, is, not, usual, for, large, herds, if, a, cow, is, left, unmilked, just, once, she, is, likely, to, reduce, milk, production, almost, immediately, and, the, rest, of, the, season, may, see, her, dried, off, giving, no, milk, and, still, consuming, feed, however, once, a, day, milking, is, now, being, practised, more, widely, in, new, zealand, for, profit, and, lifestyle, reasons, this, is, effective, because, the, fall, in, milk, yield, is, at, least, partially, offset, by, labour, and, cost, savings, from, milking, once, per, day, this, compares, to, some, intensive, farm, systems, in, the, united, states, that, milk, three, or, more, times, per, day, due, to, higher, milk, yields, per, cow, and, lower, marginal, labour, costs, farmers, who, are, contracted, to, supply, liquid, milk, for, human, consumption, as, opposed, to, milk, for, processing, into, butter, cheese, and, so, on, see, milk, often, have, to, manage, their, herd, so, that, the, contracted, number, of, cows, are, in, milk, the, year, round, or, the, required, minimum, milk, output, is, maintained, this, is, done, by, mating, cows, outside, their, natural, mating, time, so, that, the, period, when, each, cow, in, the, herd, is, giving, maximum, production, is, in, rotation, throughout, the, year, northern, hemisphere, farmers, who, keep, cows, in, barns, almost, all, the, year, usually, manage, their, herds, to, give, continuous, production, of, milk, so, that, they, get, paid, all, year, round, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, cooperative, dairying, systems, allow, for, two, months, of, no, productivity, because, their, systems, are, designed, to, take, advantage, of, maximum, grass, and, milk, production, in, the, spring, and, because, the, milk, processing, plants, pay, bonuses, in, the, dry, winter, season, to, carry, the, farmers, through, the, mid, winter, break, from, milking, it, also, means, that, cows, have, a, rest, from, milk, production, when, they, are, most, heavily, pregnant, some, year, round, milk, farms, are, penalised, financially, for, overproduction, at, any, time, in, the, year, by, being, unable, to, sell, their, overproduction, at, current, prices, artificial, insemination, ai, is, common, in, all, high, production, herds, in, order, to, improve, the, genetics, of, the, female, offspring, which, will, be, raised, for, replacements, ai, also, reduces, the, need, for, keeping, potentially, dangerous, bulls, on, the, farm, male, calves, are, sold, to, be, raised, for, beef, or, veal, or, slaughtered, due, to, lack, of, profitability, a, cow, will, calve, or, freshen, about, once, a, year, until, she, is, culled, because, of, declining, production, infertility, or, other, health, problems, then, the, cow, will, be, sold, most, often, going, to, slaughter, dairy, plants, process, the, raw, milk, they, receive, from, farmers, so, as, to, extend, its, marketable, life, two, main, types, of, processes, are, employed, heat, treatment, to, ensure, the, safety, of, milk, for, human, consumption, and, to, lengthen, its, shelf, life, and, dehydrating, dairy, products, such, as, butter, hard, cheese, and, milk, powders, so, that, they, can, be, stored, today, milk, is, separated, by, huge, machines, in, bulk, into, cream, and, skim, milk, the, cream, is, processed, to, produce, various, consumer, products, depending, on, its, thickness, its, suitability, for, culinary, uses, and, consumer, demand, which, differs, from, place, to, place, and, country, to, country, some, milk, is, dried, and, powdered, some, is, condensed, by, evaporation, mixed, with, varying, amounts, of, sugar, and, canned, most, cream, from, new, zealand, and, australian, factories, is, made, into, butter, this, is, done, by, churning, the, cream, until, the, fat, globules, coagulate, and, form, a, monolithic, mass, this, butter, mass, is, washed, and, sometimes, salted, to, improve, keeping, qualities, the, residual, buttermilk, goes, on, to, further, processing, the, butter, is, packaged, 25, to, 50, kg, boxes, and, chilled, for, storage, and, sale, at, a, later, stage, these, packages, are, broken, down, into, home, consumption, sized, packs, the, product, left, after, the, cream, is, removed, is, called, skim, or, skimmed, milk, to, make, a, consumable, liquid, a, portion, of, cream, is, returned, to, the, skim, milk, to, make, low, fat, milk, semi, skimmed, for, human, consumption, by, varying, the, amount, of, cream, returned, producers, can, make, a, variety, of, low, fat, milks, to, suit, their, local, market, whole, milk, is, also, made, by, adding, cream, back, to, the, skim, to, form, a, standardised, product, other, products, such, as, calcium, vitamin, d, and, flavouring, are, also, added, to, appeal, to, consumers, casein, is, the, predominant, phosphoprotein, found, in, fresh, milk, it, has, a, very, wide, range, of, uses, from, being, a, filler, for, human, foods, such, as, in, ice, cream, to, the, manufacture, of, products, such, as, fabric, adhesives, and, plastics, cheese, is, another, product, made, from, milk, whole, milk, is, reacted, to, form, curds, that, can, be, compressed, processed, and, stored, to, form, cheese, in, countries, where, milk, is, legally, allowed, to, be, processed, without, pasteurisation, a, wide, range, of, cheeses, can, be, made, using, the, bacteria, found, naturally, in, the, milk, in, most, other, countries, the, range, of, cheeses, is, smaller, and, the, use, of, artificial, cheese, curing, is, greater, whey, is, also, the, byproduct, of, this, process, some, people, with, lactose, intolerance, are, able, to, eat, certain, types, of, cheese, this, is, because, some, traditionally, made, hard, cheeses, and, soft, ripened, cheeses, may, create, less, reaction, than, the, equivalent, amount, of, milk, because, of, the, processes, involved, fermentation, and, higher, fat, content, contribute, to, lesser, amounts, of, lactose, traditionally, made, emmental, or, cheddar, might, contain, 10, of, the, lactose, found, in, whole, milk, in, addition, the, ageing, methods, of, traditional, cheeses, sometimes, over, two, years, reduce, their, lactose, content, to, practically, nothing, commercial, cheeses, however, are, often, manufactured, by, processes, that, do, not, have, the, same, lactose, reducing, properties, ageing, of, some, cheeses, is, governed, by, regulations, in, other, cases, there, is, no, quantitative, indication, of, degree, of, ageing, and, concomitant, lactose, reduction, and, lactose, content, is, not, usually, indicated, on, labels, in, earlier, times, whey, or, milk, serum, was, considered, to, be, a, waste, product, and, it, was, mostly, fed, to, pigs, as, a, convenient, means, of, disposal, beginning, about, 1950, and, mostly, since, about, 1980, lactose, and, many, other, products, mainly, food, additives, are, made, from, both, casein, and, cheese, whey, yogurt, or, yoghurt, making, is, a, process, similar, to, cheese, making, only, the, process, is, arrested, before, the, curd, becomes, very, hard, milk, is, also, processed, by, various, drying, processes, into, powders, whole, milk, skim, milk, buttermilk, and, whey, products, are, dried, into, a, powder, form, and, used, for, human, and, animal, consumption, the, main, difference, between, production, of, powders, for, human, or, for, animal, consumption, is, in, the, protection, of, the, process, and, the, product, from, contamination, some, people, drink, milk, reconstituted, from, powdered, milk, because, milk, is, about, 88, water, and, it, is, much, cheaper, to, transport, the, dried, product, kumis, is, produced, commercially, in, central, asia, although, traditionally, made, from, mare, s, milk, modern, industrial, variants, may, use, cow, s, milk, in, india, which, produces, 22, of, global, milk, production, as, at, 2018, a, range, of, traditional, milk, based, products, are, produced, commercially, originally, milking, and, processing, took, place, on, the, dairy, farm, itself, later, cream, was, separated, from, the, milk, by, machine, on, the, farm, and, transported, to, a, factory, to, be, made, into, butter, the, skim, milk, was, fed, to, pigs, this, allowed, for, the, high, cost, of, transport, taking, the, smallest, volume, high, value, product, primitive, trucks, and, the, poor, quality, of, roads, only, farms, close, to, factories, could, afford, to, take, whole, milk, which, was, essential, for, cheesemaking, in, industrial, quantities, to, them, originally, milk, was, distributed, in, pails, a, lidded, bucket, with, a, handle, these, proved, impractical, for, transport, by, road, or, rail, and, so, the, milk, churn, was, introduced, based, on, the, tall, conical, shape, of, the, butter, churn, later, large, railway, containers, such, as, the, british, railway, milk, tank, wagon, were, introduced, enabling, the, transport, of, larger, quantities, of, milk, and, over, longer, distances, the, development, of, refrigeration, and, better, road, transport, in, the, late, 1950s, has, meant, that, most, farmers, milk, their, cows, and, only, temporarily, store, the, milk, in, large, refrigerated, bulk, tanks, from, where, it, is, later, transported, by, truck, to, central, processing, facilities, in, many, european, countries, particularly, the, united, kingdom, milk, is, then, delivered, direct, to, customers, homes, by, a, milk, float, in, the, united, states, a, dairy, cow, produced, about, 5, 300, pounds, 2, 400, kg, of, milk, per, year, in, 1950, while, the, average, holstein, cow, in, 2019, produces, more, than, 23, 000, pounds, 10, 000, kg, of, milk, per, year, milking, machines, are, used, to, harvest, milk, from, cows, when, manual, milking, becomes, inefficient, or, labour, intensive, one, early, model, was, patented, in, 1907, the, milking, unit, is, the, portion, of, a, milking, machine, for, removing, milk, from, an, udder, it, is, made, up, of, a, claw, four, teatcups, shells, and, rubber, liners, long, milk, tube, long, pulsation, tube, and, a, pulsator, the, claw, is, an, assembly, that, connects, the, short, pulse, tubes, and, short, milk, tubes, from, the, teatcups, to, the, long, pulse, tube, and, long, milk, tube, cluster, assembly, claws, are, commonly, made, of, stainless, steel, or, plastic, or, both, teatcups, are, composed, of, a, rigid, outer, shell, stainless, steel, or, plastic, that, holds, a, soft, inner, liner, or, inflation, transparent, sections, in, the, shell, may, allow, viewing, of, liner, collapse, and, milk, flow, the, annular, space, between, the, shell, and, liner, is, called, the, pulse, chamber, milking, machines, work, in, a, way, that, is, different, from, hand, milking, or, calf, suckling, continuous, vacuum, is, applied, inside, the, soft, liner, to, massage, milk, from, the, teat, by, creating, a, pressure, difference, across, the, teat, canal, or, opening, at, the, end, of, the, teat, vacuum, also, helps, keep, the, machine, attached, to, the, cow, the, vacuum, applied, to, the, teat, causes, congestion, of, teat, tissues, accumulation, of, blood, and, other, fluids, atmospheric, air, is, admitted, into, the, pulsation, chamber, about, once, per, second, the, pulsation, rate, to, allow, the, liner, to, collapse, around, the, end, of, teat, and, relieve, congestion, in, the, teat, tissue, the, ratio, of, the, time, that, the, liner, is, open, milking, phase, and, closed, rest, phase, is, called, the, pulsation, ratio, the, four, streams, of, milk, from, the, teatcups, are, usually, combined, in, the, claw, and, transported, to, the, milkline, or, the, collection, bucket, usually, sized, to, the, output, of, one, cow, in, a, single, milk, hose, milk, is, then, transported, manually, in, buckets, or, with, a, combination, of, airflow, and, mechanical, pump, to, a, central, storage, vat, or, bulk, tank, milk, is, refrigerated, on, the, farm, in, most, countries, either, by, passing, through, a, heat, exchanger, or, in, the, bulk, tank, or, both, the, photo, to, the, right, shows, a, bucket, milking, system, with, the, stainless, steel, bucket, visible, on, the, far, side, of, the, cow, the, two, rigid, stainless, steel, teatcup, shells, applied, to, the, front, two, quarters, of, the, udder, are, visible, the, top, of, the, flexible, liner, is, visible, at, the, top, of, the, shells, as, are, the, short, milk, tubes, and, short, pulsation, tubes, extending, from, the, bottom, of, the, shells, to, the, claw, the, bottom, of, the, claw, is, transparent, to, allow, observation, of, milk, flow, when, milking, is, completed, the, vacuum, to, the, milking, unit, is, shut, off, and, the, teatcups, are, removed, milking, machines, keep, the, milk, enclosed, and, safe, from, external, contamination, the, interior, milk, contact, surfaces, of, the, machine, are, kept, clean, by, a, manual, or, automated, washing, procedures, implemented, after, milking, is, completed, milk, contact, surfaces, must, comply, with, regulations, requiring, food, grade, materials, typically, stainless, steel, and, special, plastics, and, rubber, compounds, and, are, easily, cleaned, most, milking, machines, are, powered, by, electricity, but, in, case, of, electrical, failure, there, can, be, an, alternative, means, of, motive, power, often, an, internal, combustion, engine, for, the, vacuum, and, milk, pumps, this, type, of, milking, facility, was, the, first, development, after, open, paddock, milking, for, many, farmers, the, building, was, a, long, narrow, lean, to, shed, that, was, open, along, one, long, side, the, cows, were, held, in, a, yard, at, the, open, side, and, when, they, were, about, to, be, milked, they, were, positioned, in, one, of, the, bails, stalls, usually, the, cows, were, restrained, in, the, bail, with, a, breech, chain, and, a, rope, to, restrain, the, outer, back, leg, the, cow, could, not, move, about, excessively, and, the, milker, could, expect, not, to, be, kicked, or, trampled, while, sitting, on, a, three, legged, stool, and, milking, into, a, bucket, when, each, cow, was, finished, she, backed, out, into, the, yard, again, the, uk, bail, initially, developed, by, wiltshire, dairy, farmer, arthur, hosier, was, a, six, standing, mobile, shed, with, steps, that, the, cow, mounted, so, the, herdsman, did, not, have, to, bend, so, low, the, milking, equipment, was, much, as, today, a, vacuum, from, a, pump, pulsators, a, claw, piece, with, pipes, leading, to, the, four, shells, and, liners, that, stimulate, and, suck, the, milk, from, the, teat, the, milk, went, into, churns, via, a, cooler, as, herd, sizes, increased, a, door, was, set, into, the, front, of, each, bail, so, that, when, the, milking, was, done, for, any, cow, the, milker, could, after, undoing, the, leg, rope, and, with, a, remote, link, open, the, door, and, allow, her, to, exit, to, the, pasture, the, door, was, closed, the, next, cow, walked, into, the, bail, and, was, secured, when, milking, machines, were, introduced, bails, were, set, in, pairs, so, that, a, cow, was, being, milked, in, one, paired, bail, while, the, other, could, be, prepared, for, milking, when, one, was, finished, the, machine, s, cups, are, swapped, to, the, other, cow, this, is, the, same, as, for, swingover, milking, parlours, as, described, below, except, that, the, cups, are, loaded, on, the, udder, from, the, side, as, herd, numbers, increased, it, was, easier, to, double, up, the, cup, sets, and, milk, both, cows, simultaneously, than, to, increase, the, number, of, bails, about, 50, cows, an, hour, can, be, milked, in, a, shed, with, 8, bails, by, one, person, using, the, same, teat, cups, for, successive, cows, has, the, danger, of, transmitting, infection, mastitis, from, one, cow, to, another, some, farmers, have, devised, their, own, ways, to, disinfect, the, clusters, between, cows, in, herringbone, milking, sheds, or, parlours, cows, enter, in, single, file, and, line, up, almost, perpendicular, to, the, central, aisle, of, the, milking, parlour, on, both, sides, of, a, central, pit, in, which, the, milker, works, you, can, visualise, a, fishbone, with, the, ribs, representing, the, cows, and, the, spine, being, the, milker, s, working, area, the, cows, face, outward, after, washing, the, udder, and, teats, the, cups, of, the, milking, machine, are, applied, to, the, cows, from, the, rear, of, their, hind, legs, on, both, sides, of, the, working, area, large, herringbone, sheds, can, milk, up, to, 600, cows, efficiently, with, two, people, swingover, parlours, are, the, same, as, herringbone, parlours, except, they, have, only, one, set, of, milking, cups, to, be, shared, between, the, two, rows, of, cows, as, one, side, is, being, milked, the, cows, on, the, other, side, are, moved, out, and, replaced, with, unmilked, ones, the, advantage, of, this, system, is, that, it, is, less, costly, to, equip, however, it, operates, at, slightly, better, than, half, speed, and, one, would, not, normally, try, to, milk, more, than, about, 100, cows, with, one, person, rotary, milking, sheds, also, known, as, rotary, milking, parlor, consist, of, a, turntable, with, about, 12, to, 100, individual, stalls, for, cows, around, the, outer, edge, a, good, rotary, will, be, operated, with, 24, 32, 48, 50, stalls, by, one, two, milkers, the, turntable, is, turned, by, an, electric, motor, drive, at, a, rate, that, one, turn, is, the, time, for, a, cow, to, be, milked, completely, as, an, empty, stall, passes, the, entrance, a, cow, steps, on, facing, the, center, and, rotates, with, the, turntable, the, next, cow, moves, into, the, next, vacant, stall, and, so, on, the, operator, or, milker, cleans, the, teats, attaches, the, cups, and, does, any, other, feeding, or, whatever, husbanding, operations, that, are, necessary, cows, are, milked, as, the, platform, rotates, the, milker, or, an, automatic, device, removes, the, milking, machine, cups, and, the, cow, backs, out, and, leaves, at, an, exit, just, before, the, entrance, the, rotary, system, is, capable, of, milking, very, large, herds, over, a, thousand, cows, automatic, milking, or, robotic, milking, sheds, can, be, seen, in, australia, new, zealand, the, u, s, canada, and, many, european, countries, current, automatic, milking, sheds, use, the, voluntary, milking, vm, method, these, allow, the, cows, to, voluntarily, present, themselves, for, milking, at, any, time, of, the, day, or, night, although, repeat, visits, may, be, limited, by, the, farmer, through, computer, software, a, robot, arm, is, used, to, clean, teats, and, apply, milking, equipment, while, automated, gates, direct, cow, traffic, eliminating, the, need, for, the, farmer, to, be, present, during, the, process, the, entire, process, is, computer, controlled, farmers, soon, realised, that, a, milking, shed, was, a, good, place, to, feed, cows, supplementary, foods, that, overcame, local, dietary, deficiencies, or, added, to, the, cows, wellbeing, and, production, each, bail, might, have, a, box, into, which, such, feed, is, delivered, as, the, cow, arrives, so, that, she, is, eating, while, being, milked, a, computer, can, read, the, eartag, of, each, animal, to, ration, the, correct, individual, supplement, a, close, alternative, is, to, use, out, of, parlour, feeders, stalls, that, respond, to, a, transponder, around, the, cow, s, neck, that, is, programmed, to, provide, each, cow, with, a, supplementary, feed, the, quantity, dependent, on, her, production, stage, in, lactation, and, the, benefits, of, the, main, ration, the, holding, yard, at, the, entrance, of, the, shed, is, important, as, a, means, of, keeping, cows, moving, into, the, shed, most, yards, have, a, powered, gate, that, ensures, that, the, cows, are, kept, close, to, the, shed, water, is, a, vital, commodity, on, a, dairy, farm, cows, drink, about, 20, gallons, 80, litres, a, day, sheds, need, water, to, cool, and, clean, them, pumps, and, reservoirs, are, common, at, milking, facilities, water, can, be, warmed, by, heat, transfer, with, milk, milk, coming, from, the, cow, is, transported, to, a, nearby, storage, vessel, by, the, airflow, leaking, around, the, cups, on, the, cow, or, by, a, special, air, inlet, 5, 10, l, min, free, air, in, the, claw, from, there, it, is, pumped, by, a, mechanical, pump, and, cooled, by, a, heat, exchanger, the, milk, is, then, stored, in, a, large, vat, or, bulk, tank, which, is, usually, refrigerated, until, collection, for, processing, in, countries, where, cows, are, grazed, outside, year, round, there, is, little, waste, disposal, to, deal, with, the, most, concentrated, waste, is, at, the, milking, shed, where, the, animal, waste, may, be, liquefied, during, the, water, washing, process, or, left, in, a, more, solid, form, either, to, be, returned, to, be, used, on, farm, ground, as, organic, fertiliser, in, the, associated, milk, processing, factories, most, of, the, waste, is, washing, water, that, is, treated, usually, by, composting, and, spread, on, farm, fields, in, either, liquid, or, solid, form, this, is, much, different, from, half, a, century, ago, when, the, main, products, were, butter, cheese, and, casein, and, the, rest, of, the, milk, had, to, be, disposed, of, as, waste, sometimes, as, animal, feed, in, the, dairy, industries, two, are, main, types, of, wastewater, produced, dairy, wastewater, and, cheese, whey, dairy, wastewater, consists, of, material, losses, from, the, dairy, products, effluents, from, the, washing, of, tanks, and, equipment, and, sanitary, wastewater, from, toilets, and, sinks, the, typical, concentrations, of, bod, and, total, kjeldahl, nitrogen, for, dairy, wastewater, range, from, 1200, to, 5000, mg, l, and, 30, to, 200, mg, l, respectively, cheese, whey, is, the, liquid, remaining, after, the, formation, of, curds, it, contains, important, amounts, of, carbohydrates, proteins, lactic, acid, fats, and, salts, and, its, bod, value, can, exceed, 40, 000, mg, l, dairy, wastewater, management, usually, includes, equalisation, neutralisation, and, physical, separation, followed, by, biological, treatment, while, cheese, whey, is, treated, in, anaerobic, digesters, or, passes, through, membranes, for, proteins, recovery, in, dairy, intensive, areas, various, methods, have, been, proposed, for, disposing, of, large, quantities, of, milk, large, application, rates, of, milk, onto, land, or, disposing, in, a, hole, is, problematic, as, the, residue, from, the, decomposing, milk, will, block, the, soil, pores, and, thereby, reduce, the, water, infiltration, rate, through, the, soil, profile, as, recovery, of, this, effect, can, take, time, any, land, based, application, needs, to, be, well, managed, and, considered, other, waste, milk, disposal, methods, commonly, employed, include, solidification, and, disposal, at, a, solid, waste, landfill, disposal, at, a, wastewater, treatment, plant, or, discharge, into, a, sanitary, sewer, dairy, products, manufactured, under, unsanitary, or, unsuitable, conditions, have, an, increased, chance, of, containing, bacteria, proper, sanitation, practices, help, to, reduce, the, rate, of, bacterial, contamination, and, pasteurisation, greatly, decreases, the, amount, of, contaminated, milk, that, reaches, the, consumer, many, countries, have, required, government, oversight, and, regulations, regarding, dairy, production, including, requirements, for, pasteurisation, a, portion, of, the, population, including, vegans, and, many, jains, object, to, dairy, production, as, unethical, cruel, to, animals, and, environmentally, deleterious, they, do, not, consume, dairy, products, they, state, that, cattle, suffer, under, conditions, employed, by, the, dairy, industry, animal, rights, scholars, consider, dairy, as, part, of, the, animal, industrial, complex, according, to, kathleen, stachowski, the, animal, industrial, complex, naturalizes, the, human, as, a, consumer, of, other, animals, whose, enormity, includes, its, long, reach, into, our, lives, and, how, well, it, has, done, its, job, normalizing, brutality, toward, the, animals, whose, very, existence, is, forgotten, she, states, that, the, corporate, dairy, industry, the, government, and, schools, forms, the, animal, industrial, complex, troika, of, immense, influence, which, hides, from, the, public, s, view, the, animal, rights, violations, and, cruelties, happening, within, the, dairy, industry, stachowski, also, states, that, the, troika, hijacks, schoolchildren, by, promoting, milk, in, the, k, 12, nutrition, education, curriculum, and, making, them, eat, the, products, of, industrial, animal, production, in, 1937, it, was, found, that, bovine, somatotropin, bst, or, bovine, growth, hormone, would, increase, the, yield, of, milk, several, pharmaceutical, companies, developed, commercial, rbst, products, and, they, have, been, approved, for, use, in, the, u, s, mexico, brazil, india, russia, and, at, least, ten, others, the, world, health, organization, and, others, have, stated, that, dairy, products, and, meat, from, bst, treated, cows, are, safe, for, human, consumption, however, based, on, negative, animal, welfare, effects, rbst, has, not, been, allowed, in, canada, australia, new, zealand, japan, israel, or, the, european, union, since, 2000, and, in, the, u, s, has, lost, popularity, due, to, consumer, demands, for, rbst, free, cows, with, only, about, 17, of, all, cows, in, america, now, receiving, rbst
