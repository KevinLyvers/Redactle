a, taxi, also, known, as, a, taxicab, or, simply, a, cab, is, a, type, of, vehicle, for, hire, with, a, driver, used, by, a, single, passenger, or, small, group, of, passengers, often, for, a, non, shared, ride, a, taxicab, conveys, passengers, between, locations, of, their, choice, this, differs, from, public, transport, where, the, pick, up, and, drop, off, locations, are, decided, by, the, service, provider, not, by, the, customers, although, demand, responsive, transport, and, share, taxis, provide, a, hybrid, bus, taxi, mode, there, are, four, distinct, forms, of, taxicab, which, can, be, identified, by, slightly, differing, terms, in, different, countries, although, types, of, vehicles, and, methods, of, regulation, hiring, dispatching, and, negotiating, payment, differ, significantly, from, country, to, country, many, common, characteristics, exist, disputes, over, whether, ridesharing, companies, should, be, regulated, as, taxicabs, resulted, in, some, jurisdictions, creating, new, regulations, for, these, services, the, word, taxicab, is, a, compound, word, formed, as, a, contraction, of, taximeter, and, cabriolet, taximeter, is, an, adaptation, of, the, german, word, taxameter, which, is, itself, a, variant, of, the, earlier, german, word, taxanom, taxe, taks, is, a, german, word, meaning, tax, charge, or, scale, of, charges, the, medieval, latin, word, taxa, also, means, tax, or, charge, taxi, may, ultimately, be, attributed, to, ancient, greek, from, meaning, to, place, in, a, certain, order, as, in, commanding, an, orderly, battle, line, or, in, ordaining, the, payment, of, taxes, to, the, extent, that, taxidi, meaning, journey, in, modern, greek, initially, denoted, an, orderly, military, march, or, campaign, meter, is, from, the, greek, metron, meaning, measure, a, cabriolet, is, a, type, of, horse, drawn, carriage, the, word, comes, from, french, cabrioler, to, leap, caper, from, italian, capriolare, to, somersault, from, latin, capreolus, roebuck, wild, goat, in, most, european, languages, that, word, has, taken, on, the, meaning, of, a, convertible, car, the, taxicabs, of, paris, were, equipped, with, the, first, meters, beginning, on, 9, march, 1898, they, were, originally, called, taxam, tres, then, renamed, taxim, tres, on, 17, october, 1904, harry, nathaniel, allen, of, the, new, york, taxicab, company, who, imported, the, first, 600, gas, powered, new, york, city, taxicabs, from, france, in, 1907, borrowed, the, word, taxicab, from, london, where, the, word, was, in, use, by, early, 1907, a, popular, but, erroneous, account, holds, that, the, vehicles, were, named, after, franz, von, taxis, from, the, house, of, thurn, and, taxis, a, 16th, century, postmaster, for, philip, of, burgundy, and, his, nephew, johann, baptiste, von, taxis, general, postmaster, for, the, holy, roman, empire, both, instituted, fast, and, reliable, postal, services, conveying, letters, with, some, post, routes, transporting, people, across, europe, their, surname, derives, from, their, 13th, century, ancestor, omodeo, tasso, horse, drawn, for, hire, hackney, carriage, services, began, operating, in, both, paris, and, london, in, the, early, 17th, century, the, first, documented, public, hackney, coach, service, for, hire, was, in, london, in, 1605, in, 1625, carriages, were, made, available, for, hire, from, innkeepers, in, london, and, the, first, taxi, rank, appeared, on, the, strand, outside, the, maypole, inn, in, 1636, in, 1635, the, hackney, carriage, act, was, passed, by, parliament, to, legalise, horse, drawn, carriages, for, hire, coaches, were, hired, out, by, innkeepers, to, merchants, and, visitors, a, further, ordinance, for, the, regulation, of, hackney, coachmen, in, london, and, the, places, adjacent, was, approved, by, parliament, in, 1654, and, the, first, hackney, carriage, licences, were, issued, in, 1662, a, similar, service, was, started, by, nicolas, sauvage, in, paris, in, 1637, his, vehicles, were, known, as, fiacres, as, the, main, vehicle, depot, apparently, was, opposite, a, shrine, to, saint, fiacre, the, term, fiacre, is, still, used, in, french, to, describe, a, horse, drawn, vehicle, for, hire, while, the, german, term, fiaker, is, used, especially, in, austria, to, refer, to, the, same, thing, the, hansom, cab, was, designed, and, patented, in, 1834, by, joseph, hansom, an, architect, from, york, as, a, substantial, improvement, on, the, old, hackney, carriages, these, two, wheel, vehicles, were, fast, light, enough, to, be, pulled, by, a, single, horse, making, the, journey, cheaper, than, travelling, in, a, larger, four, wheel, coach, were, agile, enough, to, steer, around, horse, drawn, vehicles, in, the, notorious, traffic, jams, of, nineteenth, century, london, and, had, a, low, centre, of, gravity, for, safe, cornering, hansom, s, original, design, was, modified, by, john, chapman, and, several, others, to, improve, its, practicability, but, retained, hansom, s, name, these, soon, replaced, the, hackney, carriage, as, a, vehicle, for, hire, they, quickly, spread, to, other, cities, in, the, united, kingdom, as, well, as, continental, european, cities, particularly, paris, berlin, and, st, petersburg, the, cab, was, introduced, to, other, british, empire, cities, and, to, the, united, states, during, the, late, 19th, century, being, most, commonly, used, in, new, york, city, the, first, cab, service, in, toronto, the, city, was, established, in, 1837, by, thornton, blackburn, an, ex, slave, whose, escape, when, captured, in, detroit, was, the, impetus, for, the, blackburn, riots, the, modern, taximeter, was, invented, and, perfected, by, a, trio, of, german, inventors, wilhelm, friedrich, nedler, ferdinand, dencker, and, friedrich, wilhelm, gustav, bruhn, the, daimler, victoria, the, world, s, first, motorized, powered, taximeter, cab, was, built, by, gottlieb, daimler, in, 1897, and, began, operating, in, stuttgart, in, june, 1897, gasoline, powered, taxicabs, began, operating, in, paris, in, 1899, in, london, in, 1903, and, in, new, york, in, 1907, the, new, york, taxicabs, were, initially, imported, from, france, by, harry, n, allen, owner, of, the, allen, kingston, motor, car, company, their, manufacturing, took, place, at, bristol, engineering, in, bristol, connecticut, where, the, first, domestically, produced, taxicabs, were, built, in, 1908, designed, by, fred, e, moskovics, who, had, worked, at, daimler, in, the, late, 1890s, albert, f, rockwell, was, the, owner, of, bristol, and, his, wife, suggested, he, paint, his, taxicabs, yellow, to, maximise, his, vehicles, visibility, moskovics, was, one, of, the, organizers, of, the, first, yellow, taxicab, company, in, new, york, electric, battery, powered, taxis, became, available, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, london, walter, bersey, designed, a, fleet, of, such, cabs, and, introduced, them, to, the, streets, of, london, on, 19, august, 1897, they, were, soon, nicknamed, hummingbirds, due, to, the, idiosyncratic, humming, noise, they, made, in, the, same, year, in, new, york, city, the, samuel, s, electric, carriage, and, wagon, company, began, running, 12, electric, hansom, cabs, the, company, ran, until, 1898, with, up, to, 62, cabs, operating, until, it, was, reformed, by, its, financiers, to, form, the, electric, vehicle, company, taxicabs, proliferated, around, the, world, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, first, major, innovation, after, the, invention, of, the, taximeter, occurred, in, the, late, 1940s, when, two, way, radios, first, appeared, in, taxicabs, radios, enabled, taxicabs, and, dispatch, offices, to, communicate, and, serve, customers, more, efficiently, than, previous, methods, such, as, using, callboxes, the, next, major, innovation, occurred, in, the, 1980s, when, computer, assisted, dispatching, was, first, introduced, paris, taxis, played, a, memorable, part, in, the, french, victory, at, first, battle, of, the, marne, in, the, first, world, war, on, 7, september, 1914, the, military, governor, of, paris, joseph, gallieni, gathered, about, six, hundred, taxicabs, at, les, invalides, in, central, paris, to, carry, soldiers, to, the, front, at, nanteuil, le, haudouin, fifty, kilometers, away, within, twenty, four, hours, about, six, thousand, soldiers, and, officers, were, moved, to, the, front, each, taxi, carried, five, soldiers, four, in, the, back, and, one, next, to, the, driver, only, the, back, lights, of, the, taxis, were, lit, the, drivers, were, instructed, to, follow, the, lights, of, the, taxi, ahead, the, germans, were, surprised, and, were, pushed, back, by, the, french, and, british, armies, most, of, the, taxis, were, demobilized, on, 8, september, but, some, remained, longer, to, carry, the, wounded, and, refugees, the, taxis, following, city, regulations, dutifully, ran, their, meters, the, french, treasury, reimbursed, the, total, fare, of, 70, 012, francs, the, military, impact, of, the, soldiers, moved, by, taxi, was, small, in, the, huge, scale, of, the, battle, of, the, marne, but, the, effect, on, french, morale, was, enormous, it, became, the, symbol, of, the, solidarity, between, the, french, army, and, citizens, it, was, also, the, first, recorded, large, scale, use, of, motorized, infantry, in, battle, the, birmingham, pub, bombings, on, 21, november, 1974, which, killed, 21, people, and, injured, 182, presented, emergency, services, with, unprecedented, peacetime, demands, according, to, eyewitness, accounts, the, fire, officer, in, charge, knowing, the, 40, ambulances, he, requested, were, unlikely, to, be, available, requested, the, taxi, owners, association, to, transport, the, injured, to, the, nearby, birmingham, accident, hospital, and, birmingham, general, hospital, taxi, services, are, typically, provided, by, automobiles, but, in, some, countries, various, human, powered, vehicles, such, as, the, rickshaw, or, pedicab, and, animal, powered, vehicles, such, as, the, hansom, cab, or, even, boats, such, as, water, taxies, or, gondolas, are, also, used, or, have, been, used, historically, in, western, europe, bissau, and, to, an, extent, australia, it, is, not, uncommon, for, expensive, cars, such, as, mercedes, benz, to, be, the, taxicab, of, choice, often, this, decision, is, based, upon, the, perceived, reliability, of, and, warranty, offered, with, these, vehicles, these, taxi, service, vehicles, are, almost, always, equipped, with, four, cylinder, turbodiesel, engines, and, relatively, low, levels, of, equipment, and, are, not, considered, luxury, cars, this, has, changed, though, in, countries, such, as, denmark, where, tax, regulation, makes, it, profitable, to, sell, the, vehicles, after, a, few, years, of, service, which, requires, the, cars, to, be, well, equipped, and, kept, in, good, condition, cities, like, london, and, tokyo, have, implemented, specific, regulations, like, london, s, conditions, of, fitness, that, dictate, size, fuel, efficiency, emissions, and, accessibility, standards, far, stricter, than, that, for, private, vehicles, much, like, the, ny, checker, cabs, of, the, 60s, 80s, the, unique, attributes, of, the, city, often, make, the, vehicles, built, to, fit, those, requirements, ubiquitous, to, its, livery, fleets, and, often, becomes, an, iconic, image, of, the, city, itself, although, new, york, city, s, efforts, to, implement, new, regulations, has, stumbled, in, its, efforts, to, mandate, both, a, hybrid, and, wheelchair, accessible, vehicle, london, and, tokyo, s, efforts, have, yielded, unique, vehicles, such, the, levc, tx, and, toyota, jpn, taxi, that, meet, and, exceed, modern, emissions, and, accessibility, requirements, for, the, future, and, will, hopefully, soon, extend, to, other, cities, as, older, models, get, rotated, out, of, the, bigger, cities, and, into, smaller, markets, modifications, of, existing, minivans, such, as, the, mercedes, vito, london, taxi, and, the, nissan, nv200, have, been, introduced, as, a, stopgap, measures, to, fill, the, need, for, alternative, products, however, their, acceptance, by, drivers, is, yet, to, be, seen, in, recent, years, some, companies, have, been, adding, specially, modified, vehicles, capable, of, transporting, wheelchair, using, passengers, to, their, fleets, such, taxicabs, are, variously, called, accessible, taxis, wheelchair, or, wheelchair, accessible, taxicabs, modified, taxicabs, or, maxicabs, wheelchair, taxicabs, are, most, often, specially, modified, vans, or, minivans, wheelchair, using, passengers, are, loaded, with, the, help, of, the, driver, via, a, lift, or, more, commonly, a, ramp, at, the, rear, of, the, vehicle, this, feature, is, however, a, subject, for, concern, amongst, licensing, authorities, who, feel, that, the, wheelchair, passenger, could, not, easily, exit, the, vehicle, in, the, event, of, accident, damage, to, the, rear, door, the, latest, generation, of, accessible, taxis, features, side, loading, with, emergency, egress, possible, from, either, of, the, 2, side, doors, as, well, as, the, rear, the, wheelchair, is, secured, using, various, systems, commonly, including, some, type, of, belt, and, clip, combination, or, wheel, locks, some, wheelchair, taxicabs, are, capable, of, transporting, only, one, wheelchair, using, passenger, at, a, time, and, can, usually, accommodate, 4, to, 6, additional, non, disabled, passengers, wheelchair, taxicabs, are, part, of, the, regular, fleet, in, most, cases, and, so, are, not, reserved, exclusively, for, the, use, of, wheelchair, users, they, are, often, used, by, non, disabled, people, who, need, to, transport, luggage, small, items, of, furniture, animals, and, other, items, because, of, this, and, since, only, a, small, percentage, of, the, average, fleet, is, modified, wheelchair, users, must, often, wait, for, significantly, longer, periods, when, calling, for, a, cab, and, flagging, a, modified, taxicab, on, the, street, is, much, more, difficult, london, s, taxis, have, been, fully, accessible, since, january, 2000, with, all, taxis, fitted, with, a, pull, out, or, portable, ramp, taxicabs, in, less, developed, places, can, be, a, completely, different, experience, such, as, the, antique, french, cars, typically, found, in, cairo, however, starting, in, march, 2006, newer, modern, taxicabs, entered, the, service, operated, by, various, private, companies, taxicabs, differ, in, other, ways, as, well, london, s, black, cabs, have, a, large, compartment, beside, the, driver, for, storing, bags, while, many, fleets, of, regular, taxis, also, include, wheelchair, accessible, taxicabs, among, their, numbers, see, above, although, taxicabs, have, traditionally, been, sedans, minivans, hatchbacks, and, even, suv, taxicabs, are, becoming, increasingly, common, in, many, cities, limousines, operate, as, well, usually, in, competition, with, taxicabs, and, at, higher, fares, recently, with, growing, concern, for, the, environment, there, have, been, solar, powered, taxicabs, on, 20, april, 2008, a, solar, taxi, tour, was, launched, that, aimed, to, tour, 15, countries, in, 18, months, in, a, solar, taxi, that, can, reach, speeds, of, 90, km, h, with, zero, emission, the, aim, of, the, tour, was, to, spread, knowledge, about, environmental, protection, most, taxi, companies, have, some, sort, of, livery, on, the, vehicle, depending, on, the, type, of, taxi, taxi, cab, private, hire, chauffeur, country, region, and, operator, most, places, allow, a, taxi, to, be, hailed, or, flagged, on, the, side, of, the, street, as, it, is, approaching, another, option, is, a, taxi, stand, sometimes, also, called, a, cab, stand, hack, stand, taxi, rank, or, cab, rank, taxi, stands, are, usually, located, at, airports, railway, stations, major, retail, areas, malls, hotels, and, other, places, where, a, large, number, of, passengers, are, likely, to, be, found, in, some, places, japan, for, example, taxi, stands, are, arranged, according, to, the, size, of, the, taxis, so, that, large, and, small, capacity, cabs, line, up, separately, the, taxi, at, the, front, of, the, line, is, due, barring, unusual, circumstances, for, the, next, fare, passengers, also, commonly, call, a, central, dispatch, office, for, taxis, in, some, jurisdictions, private, hire, vehicles, can, only, be, hired, from, the, dispatch, office, and, must, be, assigned, each, fare, by, the, office, by, radio, or, phone, picking, up, passengers, off, the, street, in, these, areas, can, lead, to, suspension, or, revocation, of, the, driver, s, taxi, license, or, even, prosecution, other, areas, may, have, a, mix, of, the, two, systems, where, drivers, may, respond, to, radio, calls, and, also, pick, up, street, fares, passengers, may, also, hire, taxicabs, via, mobile, apps, while, not, directly, involving, the, call, center, the, taxis, are, still, monitored, by, the, dispatcher, through, gps, tracking, many, taxicab, companies, including, gett, easy, taxi, and, grabtaxi, provide, mobile, apps, the, activity, of, taxi, fleets, is, usually, monitored, and, controlled, by, a, central, office, which, provides, dispatching, accounting, and, human, resources, services, to, one, or, more, taxi, companies, taxi, owners, and, drivers, usually, communicate, with, the, dispatch, office, through, either, a, 2, way, radio, or, a, computer, terminal, called, a, mobile, data, terminal, before, the, innovation, of, radio, dispatch, in, the, 1950s, taxi, drivers, would, use, a, callbox, a, special, telephone, at, a, taxi, stand, to, contact, the, dispatch, office, when, a, customer, calls, for, a, taxi, a, trip, is, dispatched, by, either, radio, or, computer, via, an, in, vehicle, mobile, data, terminal, to, the, most, suitable, cab, the, most, suitable, cab, may, either, be, the, one, closest, to, the, pick, up, address, often, determined, by, gps, coordinates, nowadays, or, the, one, that, was, the, first, to, book, into, the, zone, surrounding, the, pickup, address, cabs, are, sometimes, dispatched, from, their, taxi, stands, a, call, to, top, of, the, 2, means, that, the, first, cab, in, line, at, stand, 2, is, supposed, to, pick, someone, up, in, offices, using, radio, dispatch, taxi, locations, are, often, tracked, using, magnetic, pegs, on, a, board, a, metal, sheet, with, an, engraved, map, of, taxi, zones, in, computerized, dispatch, the, status, of, taxis, is, tracked, by, the, computer, system, taxi, frequencies, are, generally, licensed, in, duplex, pairs, one, frequency, is, used, for, the, dispatcher, to, talk, to, the, cabs, and, a, second, frequency, is, used, to, the, cabs, to, talk, back, this, means, that, the, drivers, generally, cannot, talk, to, each, other, some, cabs, have, a, cb, radio, in, addition, to, the, company, radio, so, they, can, speak, to, each, other, in, the, united, states, there, is, a, taxicab, radio, service, with, pairs, assigned, for, this, purpose, a, taxi, company, can, also, be, licensed, in, the, business, radio, service, business, frequencies, in, the, uhf, range, are, also, licensed, in, pairs, to, allow, for, repeaters, though, taxi, companies, usually, use, the, pair, for, duplex, communications, taxi, dispatch, is, evolving, in, connection, to, the, telecom, sector, with, the, advent, of, smart, phones, in, some, countries, such, as, australia, canada, germany, the, uk, and, usa, smartphone, applications, are, emerging, that, connect, taxi, drivers, directly, with, passengers, for, the, purpose, of, dispatching, taxi, jobs, launching, new, battles, for, the, marketing, of, such, apps, over, the, potential, mass, of, taxi, users, taxi, fares, are, set, by, the, state, and, city, where, they, are, permitted, to, operate, the, fare, includes, the, drop, a, set, amount, that, is, tallied, for, getting, into, the, taxi, plus, the, per, kilometer, rate, as, has, been, set, by, the, city, the, taxi, meters, track, time, as, well, as, distance, in, an, average, taxi, fare, in, the, united, states, a, nut, is, industry, slang, for, the, amount, of, money, a, driver, has, to, pay, upfront, to, lease, a, taxi, for, a, specific, period, of, time, once, that, amount, is, collected, in, fare, the, driver, then, begins, to, make, a, profit, a, driver, on, the, nut, is, trying, to, earn, back, the, initial, cost, this, varies, from, city, to, city, though, in, las, vegas, nevada, all, taxicabs, are, owned, and, operated, by, the, companies, and, all, drivers, are, employees, hence, no, initial, cost, and, earn, a, percentage, of, each, fare, so, on, the, nut, simply, means, to, be, next, in, a, taxi, stand, to, receive, a, passenger, additionally, some, cab, companies, are, owned, cooperatively, with, profits, shared, through, democratic, governance, different, states, have, different, regulations, for, taxi, driver, registration, and, compliance, new, zealand, taxi, drivers, fall, under, the, definition, of, a, small, passenger, service, vehicle, driver, they, must, have, a, p, passenger, endorsement, on, their, driver, licence, until, 1, october, 2017, all, drivers, wanting, to, obtain, a, p, endorsement, had, to, complete, a, p, endorsement, course, but, that, requirement, was, removed, as, a, result, of, lobbying, by, uber, who, had, been, flouting, the, law, drivers, must, comply, with, work, time, rules, and, maintain, a, logbook, with, the, onus, on, training, falling, on, companies, and, drivers, since, the, p, endorsement, course, was, abandoned, the, new, zealand, taxi, federation, is, the, national, advocacy, group, for, taxi, companies, within, new, zealand, most, experienced, taxi, drivers, who, have, been, working, in, the, same, city, or, region, for, a, while, would, be, expected, to, know, the, most, important, streets, and, places, where, their, customers, request, to, go, however, to, aid, the, process, of, manual, navigation, and, the, taxi, driver, s, memory, and, the, customer, s, as, well, at, times, a, cab, driver, is, usually, equipped, with, a, detailed, roadmap, of, the, area, in, which, they, work, there, is, also, an, increasing, use, of, gps, driven, navigational, systems, in, wealthier, countries, in, london, despite, the, complex, and, haphazard, road, layout, such, aids, have, only, recently, been, employed, by, a, small, number, of, black, cab, taxi, as, opposed, to, minicab, drivers, instead, they, are, required, to, undergo, a, demanding, process, of, learning, and, testing, called, the, knowledge, this, typically, takes, around, three, years, and, equips, them, with, a, detailed, command, of, 25, 000, streets, within, central, london, major, routes, outside, this, area, and, all, buildings, and, other, destinations, to, which, passengers, may, ask, to, be, taken, taxicabs, have, been, both, criticized, for, creating, pollution, and, also, praised, as, an, environmentally, responsible, alternative, to, private, car, use, one, study, published, in, the, journal, atmospheric, environment, in, january, 2006, showed, that, the, level, of, pollution, that, londoners, are, exposed, to, differs, according, to, the, mode, of, transport, that, they, use, when, in, the, back, seat, of, a, taxicab, people, were, exposed, the, most, while, walking, exposing, people, to, the, lowest, amount, of, pollution, in, australia, nearly, all, taxis, run, on, lpg, as, well, as, the, growing, fleet, of, hybrids, argentina, and, the, main, cities, of, brazil, have, large, fleets, of, taxis, running, on, natural, gas, many, brazilian, taxis, are, flexible, fuel, vehicles, running, on, sugarcane, ethanol, and, some, are, equipped, to, run, on, either, natural, gas, or, as, a, flex, fuel, at, least, two, brazilian, car, makers, sell, these, type, of, bi, fuel, vehicles, malaysia, and, singapore, have, many, of, their, taxicabs, running, on, compressed, natural, gas, cng, san, francisco, became, one, of, the, first, cities, to, introduce, hybrids, for, taxi, service, in, 2005, with, a, fleet, of, 15, ford, escape, hybrids, and, by, 2009, the, original, escape, hybrids, were, retired, after, 480, 000, km, 300, 000, mi, per, vehicle, in, 2007, the, city, approved, the, clean, air, taxi, grant, program, in, order, to, encourage, cab, companies, to, purchase, alternative, fuel, vehicles, by, providing, incentives, of, us, 2, 000, per, new, alternative, fuel, vehicle, on, a, first, come,

proposing, a, mandate, for, chicago, s, entire, fleet, of, 6, 700, taxicabs, to, become, hybrid, by, 1, january, 2014, as, of, 2008, chicago, s, fleet, had, only, 50, hybrid, taxicabs, in, 2008, boston, mandated, that, its, entire, taxi, fleet, must, be, converted, to, hybrids, by, 2015, arlington, virginia, also, has, a, small, fleet, of, 85, environmentally, friendly, hybrid, cabs, introduced, in, early, 2008, the, green, taxi, expansion, is, part, of, a, county, campaign, known, as, fresh, aire, or, arlington, initiative, to, reduce, emissions, and, included, a, new, all, hybrid, taxi, company, called, envirocab, which, became, the, first, all, hybrid, taxicab, fleet, in, the, united, states, and, the, first, carbon, negative, taxicab, company, in, the, world, a, similar, all, hybrid, taxicab, company, clean, air, cab, was, launched, in, phoenix, arizona, in, october, 2009, in, japan, electric, taxicabs, are, becoming, increasingly, popular, in, 2009, battery, swap, company, better, place, teamed, with, the, japanese, government, to, trial, a, fleet, of, electric, taxis, with, the, better, place, battery, swap, system, in, yokohama, in, 2010, the, taxi, company, hinomaru, linousine, company, launched, two, mitsubishi, i, miev, electric, taxicabs, in, tokyo, both, taxicabs, had, female, drivers, and, were, branded, under, zero, taxi, livery, hybrid, taxis, are, becoming, more, and, more, common, in, canada, with, all, new, taxis, in, british, columbia, being, hybrids, or, other, fuel, efficient, vehicles, such, as, the, toyota, prius, or, toyota, corolla, hybrids, such, as, the, ford, escape, hybrid, are, slowly, being, added, to, the, taxicab, fleet, in, mexico, city, other, cities, where, taxi, service, is, available, with, hybrid, vehicles, include, tokyo, london, sydney, rome, and, singapore, seoul, introduced, the, first, lpi, hybrid, taxi, in, december, 2009, the, internal, combustion, engine, runs, on, liquefied, petroleum, gas, lpg, as, a, fuel, in, 2010, beijing, china, introduced, electric, taxis, a, trial, run, began, in, march, 2010, with, taxis, being, cheaper, than, their, regular, gasoline, counterparts, the, taxicab, limousine, paratransit, association, tlpa, was, established, in, 1917, in, the, united, states, and, is, a, non, profit, trade, association, of, and, for, the, private, passenger, transportation, industry, today, its, membership, spans, the, globe, and, includes, 1, 100, taxicab, companies, executive, sedan, and, limousine, services, airport, shuttle, fleets, non, emergency, medical, transportation, companies, and, paratransit, services, in, april, 2011, tlpa, announced, a, nationwide, transportation, on, patrol, initiative, the, top, program, gives, local, police, departments, the, materials, they, need, to, train, volunteer, taxi, drivers, to, be, good, witnesses, and, watch, out, for, criminal, behavior, taxicab, drivers, are, at, risk, for, homicide, at, a, far, higher, rate, than, the, general, working, population, in, the, united, states, 7, 4, per, 100, 000, and, 0, 37, per, 100, 000, respectively, in, efforts, to, reduce, homicides, bulletproof, partitions, were, introduced, in, many, taxicabs, in, the, 1990s, and, in, the, 21st, century, security, cameras, were, added, to, many, taxicabs, security, cameras, have, been, shown, to, be, more, effective, when, implemented, by, cities, and, not, taxicab, companies, cab, drivers, also, work, together, to, protect, one, another, both, from, physical, threats, and, passengers, who, refuse, to, pay, also, in, some, countries, it, is, reported, that, taxi, drivers, involve, in, more, unsafe, driving, behaviors, taxi, drivers, feelings, about, their, occupation, including, traffic, chaos, social, prestige, economic, pressure, and, job, satisfaction, may, impact, on, the, subsequent, driving, behaviors, supporters, of, taxicab, deregulation, may, argue, that, deregulation, causes, the, following, benefits, however, there, appears, to, be, a, consensus, that, taxi, deregulation, has, been, less, impressive, than, advocates, had, hoped, possible, reasons, include, overestimation, of, what, deregulation, could, deliver, and, insufficiently, thorough, deregulation, some, also, emphasize, that, the, strong, cab, driver, subculture, itself, the, last, american, cowboys, provides, its, own, form, of, informal, regulation, deregulation, advocates, may, claim, that, the, taxi, service, level, increases, most, in, the, poorest, sections, of, the, city, the, effect, is, highest, in, peak, hours, and, bad, weather, when, the, demand, is, highest, deregulation, advocates, also, may, claim, that, in, a, deregulated, environment, black, market, taxis, become, legal, possibly, eliminating, their, problems, in, nearly, all, deregulating, cities, the, number, of, taxis, increased, more, people, were, employed, as, drivers, and, deregulation, advocates, claim, needs, were, better, satisfied, existing, taxi, companies, may, try, to, limit, competition, by, potential, new, entrants, for, example, in, new, york, city, the, monopoly, advantage, for, taxi, license, holders, was, 590, million, in, the, early, 1980s, the, city, has, 1, 400, fewer, licenses, than, in, 1937, proponents, of, deregulation, argue, that, the, main, losers, are, the, car, less, poor, and, disabled, people, taxi, owners, form, a, strong, lobby, network, that, marginalizes, drivers, and, taxi, users, it, also, pays, local, government, officials, to, uphold, taxi, regulation, the, regulators, usually, do, not, wish, to, rise, against, the, taxi, owner, lobby, the, politicians, do, not, want, taxi, drivers, to, have, a, negative, opinion, of, them, taxi, deregulation, proponents, claims, that, immigrants, and, other, poor, minorities, suffer, most, from, taxi, regulation, because, the, work, requires, relatively, little, education, regulation, makes, entrance, to, the, taxi, business, particularly, difficult, for, them, people, who, are, elderly, disabled, housewives, and, poor, use, taxis, more, often, than, others, according, to, moore, and, rose, it, is, better, to, address, potential, problems, of, deregulation, directly, instead, of, regulating, the, number, of, taxi, licences, for, example, if, the, regulators, want, to, increase, safety, they, should, make, safety, statutes, or, publish, a, public, list, of, safe, taxi, operators, proponents, of, deregulation, also, claim, that, if, officials, want, to, regulate, prices, they, should, standardize, the, measures, rather, than, command, prices, for, example, they, may, require, that, any, distance, tariffs, are, set, for, the, first, 1, 5, miles, and, then, for, every, subsequent, 1, 3, miles, to, make, it, easier, to, compare, the, prices, of, different, taxis, they, should, not, prohibit, other, pricing, than, distance, pricing, deregulation, advocates, claim, that, regulators, only, have, a, very, limited, information, on, the, market, black, market, taxis, often, have, problems, with, safety, poor, customer, service, and, fares, this, situation, is, made, worse, because, customer, who, patronize, such, taxis, cannot, complain, to, the, police, or, media, however, proponent, of, taxi, deregulation, argue, that, when, these, illegal, taxis, become, legalized, their, behavior, will, improve, and, complaints, to, officials, about, these, formerly, illegal, taxis, would, be, allowed, taxi, companies, claim, that, deregulation, may, lead, to, an, unstable, taxi, market, however, one, pro, deregulation, study, by, kitch, isaacson, and, kasper, claims, that, the, previous, argument, is, a, myth, because, it, ignores, the, u, s, free, taxi, competition, up, to, 1929, some, deregulation, proponents, are, less, opposed, to, airport, taxi, regulation, than, to, regulation, of, other, taxi, services, they, argue, that, if, an, airport, regulates, prices, for, taxis, in, its, taxi, queues, such, regulation, has, fewer, disadvantages, than, citywide, regulation, an, airport, may, determine, prices, or, organize, different, queues, for, taxi, services, of, different, qualities, and, prices, it, can, be, argued, whether, rules, set, by, the, owner, of, an, airport, are, regulation, or, just, a, business, model, proponents, of, deregulation, argue, that, partial, deregulation, is, the, cause, of, many, cases, of, deregulation, failing, to, achieve, desirable, results, in, united, states, cities, many, u, s, cities, retained, regulations, on, prices, and, services, while, allowing, for, free, entrance, to, taxi, business, deregulation, advocates, argue, that, this, prevented, market, mechanisms, from, solving, information, problems, because, new, entrants, have, found, it, difficult, to, win, new, customers, using, new, services, or, cheap, prices, also, ride, sharing, has, often, been, prohibited, often, officials, have, also, prohibited, pricing, that, would, have, made, short, rides, in, sparsely, populated, areas, profitable, thus, drivers, have, refused, to, take, such, customers, therefore, partial, deregulation, is, not, always, enough, to, enhance, the, situation, one, study, claims, that, deregulation, was, applied, to, a, too, small, area, in, the, taxi, regulation, report, by, u, s, ftc, it, was, concluded, that, there, are, not, grounds, for, limiting, the, number, of, taxi, companies, and, cars, these, limitations, cause, a, disproportionate, burden, on, low, income, people, it, is, better, to, increase, the, pay, for, unprofitable, areas, than, to, force, the, taxis, to, serve, these, areas, according, to, the, report, the, experience, on, free, entry, and, price, competition, are, mainly, positive, prices, have, fallen, waiting, times, were, shortened, the, market, shares, of, the, biggest, companies, have, fallen, and, city, councils, have, saved, time, from, licensing, and, fare, setting, however, the, airports, should, either, set, their, own, price, ceilings, or, allow, for, price, competition, by, altering, the, queue, system, opponents, of, taxi, deregulation, argue, that, deregulation, will, result, in, high, taxi, driver, turnover, rates, which, may, cause, the, number, of, less, qualified, taxi, drivers, to, increase, dishonest, business, practices, such, as, price, gouging, especially, on, airport, routes, and, circuitous, routing, and, poor, customer, service, a, connecticut, general, assembly, report, argues, that, deregulation, fails, to, cause, price, decreases, because, taxi, passengers, typically, do, not, price, comparison, shop, when, searching, for, taxicabs, and, that, fares, usually, increased, with, deregulation, because, the, higher, supply, of, taxis, caused, drivers, earning, potential, to, decrease, this, report, claims, that, deregulation, resulted, in, dramatically, increased, taxi, supply, especially, at, already, overserved, airport, locations, fare, increases, in, every, city, and, an, increase, in, short, trip, refusals, by, taxicab, drivers, this, report, argues, that, deregulation, has, led, to, undesirable, results, in, several, american, cities, seattle, deregulated, taxis, in, 1980, resulting, in, a, high, supply, of, taxicabs, variable, rates, price, gouging, short, haul, refusals, poor, treatment, of, passengers, as, a, result, seattle, re, regulated, in, 1984, reinstating, a, restriction, on, taxicab, licenses, and, fare, controls, in, st, louis, deregulation, produced, a, 35, rise, in, taxi, fares, and, taxicab, drivers, complained, of, waiting, hours, at, airports, for, customers, at, taxicab, stands, taxicab, companies, claimed, they, increased, fares, in, order, to, make, up, for, lost, competition, resulting, from, the, increased, supply, of, taxis, as, a, result, the, st, louis, city, council, froze, new, taxicab, licenses, in, 2002, a, study, of, the, deregulation, of, taxis, in, sweden, in, 1991, showed, that, the, taxicab, supply, increased, but, average, fares, also, increased, in, almost, all, cases, specifically, average, fares, per, hour, increased, for, all, trips, average, fares, also, increased, for, fares, calculated, by, distance, per, kilometer, in, almost, every, category, studied, for, all, customer, paid, trips, in, municipalities, of, all, 3, sizes, small, medium, and, large, and, increased, for, municipality, paid, trips, in, small, and, large, municipalities, fares, only, decreased, for, municipality, paid, trips, in, medium, sized, municipalities, that, were, calculated, per, kilometer, deregulation, also, resulted, in, decreased, taxicab, productivity, and, decreased, taxi, company, revenues, this, study, concluded, that, deregulation, resulted, in, increased, fares, especially, in, rural, areas, and, the, authors, argued, that, the, increased, fares, were, due, to, low, taxi, company, revenues, after, deregulation, taxi, companies, claim, that, deregulation, would, cause, problems, raise, prices, and, lower, service, level, on, certain, hours, or, in, certain, places, the, medallion, system, has, been, defended, by, some, experts, they, argue, that, the, medallion, system, is, similar, to, a, brand, name, capital, asset, and, enforces, quality, of, service, because, quality, service, results, in, higher, ridership, thus, increasing, the, value, of, owning, the, medallion, they, argue, that, issuing, new, medallions, would, decrease, the, medallion, value, and, thus, the, incentive, for, the, medallion, owner, to, provide, quality, service, or, comply, with, city, regulations, they, also, argue, that, the, medallion, may, be, preferable, to, alternate, systems, of, regulation, such, as, fines, required, bonds, with, seizures, of, interest, payments, on, those, bonds, for, violations, or, licensing, of, all, would, be, taxis, with, revocation, of, that, license, for, violations, because, fines, are, difficult, to, collect, license, revocation, may, not, be, a, sufficient, deterrent, for, profitable, violations, such, as, price, cheating, and, because, using, penalties, on, bond, interest, payments, give, regulators, an, incentive, to, impose, penalties, to, collect, revenue, rather, than, for, legitimate, violations, medallions, do, not, earn, interest, and, thus, inappropriate, seizures, of, interest, by, regulators, is, not, possible, the, results, of, taxi, deregulation, in, specific, cities, has, varied, widely, a, study, of, taxi, deregulation, in, nine, united, states, cities, found, that, the, number, of, taxi, firms, increased, but, large, incumbent, firms, continued, to, dominate, all, but, one, of, the, nine, cities, the, taxi, prices, did, not, fall, in, real, terms, but, increased, in, every, city, studied, turnover, was, concentrated, among, small, operators, usually, one, cab, operators, little, turnover, occurred, among, medium, and, large, new, firms, and, no, exit, by, a, large, incumbent, firm, occurred, since, deregulation, productivity, decreased, by, at, least, one, third, in, all, four, cities, for, which, sufficient, data, was, obtainable, the, authors, argued, that, decreases, of, this, magnitude, in, productivity, have, serious, economic, consequences, for, taxi, drivers, by, shifting, the, industry, from, employee, drivers, to, lease, drivers, and, causing, the, average, taxi, driver, to, earn, a, lower, income, innovation, in, service, did, not, occur, in, the, deregulated, cities, because, such, innovations, especially, shared, ride, service, were, doubted, by, taxi, operators, to, be, justified, by, demand, and, because, the, operators, viewed, that, they, would, cause, a, net, decrease, in, revenue, discounts, were, offered, in, certain, deregulated, cities, however, these, discounts, were, small, 10, typically, and, were, also, offered, in, some, regulated, cities, the, study, found, a, lack, of, service, innovation, and, little, change, in, level, of, service, despite, the, increased, number, of, taxicabs, in, japan, taxi, deregulation, resulted, in, modest, decreases, in, taxi, fares, primarily, among, long, distance, trips, however, japanese, taxi, fares, are, still, very, high, still, the, highest, in, the, world, also, taxi, driver, incomes, decreased, and, the, earnings, of, taxi, companies, also, decreased, substantially, deregulation, failed, to, increase, taxicab, ridership, enough, to, compensate, taxi, companies, for, those, losses, the, burden, of, deregulation, fell, disproportionately, on, taxi, drivers, because, taxi, companies, increased, the, number, of, taxis, rented, to, drivers, to, make, more, money, from, rental, fees, which, resulted, in, stiff, competition, among, drivers, decreasing, their, earnings, transportation, professor, seiji, abe, of, kansai, university, considered, deregulation, to, be, a, failure, in, the, japanese, taxi, industry, despite, what, he, considers, success, in, other, japanese, industries, in, the, netherlands, taxi, deregulation, in, 2000, failed, to, reach, policy, objectives, of, strengthening, the, role, of, the, taxi, in, the, overall, dutch, transport, system, instead, the, deregulation, resulted, in, unanticipated, fare, increases, not, decreases, in, large, cities, and, bad, driver, behavior, became, a, serious, problem, local, authorities, had, lost, their, say, in, the, market, due, to, the, deregulation, and, thus, were, unable, to, correct, these, problems, in, south, africa, taxi, deregulation, has, resulted, in, the, emergence, of, taxi, cartels, which, carry, out, acts, of, gun, violence, against, rival, cartels, in, attempts, to, monopolize, desirable, routes, in, south, africa, taxis, were, deregulated, in, 1987, resulting, in, fierce, competition, among, new, drivers, who, then, organized, into, rival, cartels, in, the, absence, of, government, regulation, and, which, used, violence, and, gangland, tactics, to, protect, and, expand, their, territories, these, taxi, wars, have, resulted, in, between, 120, and, 330, deaths, annually, since, deregulation, these, taxi, cartels, have, engaged, in, anticompetitive, price, fixing, in, new, zealand, taxi, deregulation, increased, the, supply, of, taxi, services, and, initially, decreased, the, prices, remarkably, in, big, cities, whereas, the, effects, in, smaller, cities, were, small, in, ireland, taxi, deregulation, decreased, waiting, times, so, much, that, the, liberalization, became, very, popular, among, the, public, the, number, of, companies, was, increased, and, the, quality, of, cars, and, drives, did, not, fall, some, have, argued, that, the, regulation, should, be, completely, abolished, not, just, cut, down, minister, alan, kelly, held, a, review, of, ireland, s, taxi, industry, after, ireland, s, national, broadcaster, rt, broadcast, an, investigation, into, the, taxi,
