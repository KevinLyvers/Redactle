refresh, if, needed, the, hijri, calendar, arabic, romanized, al, taqw, m, al, hijr, or, arabic, calendar, also, known, in, english, as, the, muslim, calendar, and, islamic, calendar, is, a, lunar, calendar, consisting, of, 12, lunar, months, in, a, year, of, 354, or, 355, days, it, is, used, to, determine, the, proper, days, of, islamic, holidays, and, rituals, such, as, the, annual, fasting, and, the, annual, season, for, the, great, pilgrimage, in, almost, all, countries, where, the, predominant, religion, is, islam, the, civil, calendar, is, the, gregorian, calendar, with, syriac, month, names, used, in, the, levant, and, mesopotamia, iraq, syria, jordan, lebanon, and, palestine, but, the, religious, calendar, is, the, hijri, one, this, calendar, enumerates, the, hijri, era, whose, epoch, was, established, as, the, islamic, new, year, in, 622, ce, during, that, year, muhammad, and, his, followers, migrated, from, mecca, to, medina, and, established, the, first, muslim, community, ummah, an, event, commemorated, as, the, hijrah, in, the, west, dates, in, this, era, are, usually, denoted, ah, latin, anno, hegirae, lit, in, the, year, of, the, hijrah, in, muslim, countries, it, is, also, sometimes, denoted, as, h, from, its, arabic, form, abbreviated, in, english, years, prior, to, the, hijra, are, denoted, as, bh, before, the, hijra, since, 7, july, 2024, ce, the, current, islamic, year, is, 1446, ah, in, the, gregorian, calendar, reckoning, 1446, ah, runs, from, 7, july, 2024, to, approximately, 26, june, 2025, for, central, arabia, especially, mecca, there, is, a, lack, of, epigraphical, evidence, but, details, are, found, in, the, writings, of, muslim, authors, of, the, abbasid, era, inscriptions, of, the, ancient, south, arabian, calendars, reveal, the, use, of, a, number, of, local, calendars, at, least, some, of, these, south, arabian, calendars, followed, the, lunisolar, system, both, al, biruni, and, al, mas, udi, suggest, that, the, ancient, arabs, used, the, same, month, names, as, the, muslims, though, they, also, record, other, month, names, used, by, the, pre, islamic, arabs, the, islamic, tradition, is, unanimous, in, stating, that, arabs, of, tihamah, hejaz, and, najd, distinguished, between, two, types, of, months, permitted, al, l, and, forbidden, ar, m, months, the, forbidden, months, were, four, months, during, which, fighting, is, forbidden, listed, as, rajab, and, the, three, months, around, the, pilgrimage, season, dhu, al, qa, dah, dhu, al, hijjah, and, muharram, a, similar, if, not, identical, concept, to, the, forbidden, months, is, also, attested, by, procopius, where, he, describes, an, armistice, that, the, eastern, arabs, of, the, lakhmid, al, mundhir, respected, for, two, months, in, the, summer, solstice, of, 541, ce, however, muslim, historians, do, not, link, these, months, to, a, particular, season, the, qur, an, links, the, four, forbidden, months, with, nas, a, word, that, literally, means, postponement, according, to, muslim, tradition, the, decision, of, postponement, was, administered, by, the, tribe, of, kinanah, by, a, man, known, as, the, al, qalammas, of, kinanah, and, his, descendants, pl, qal, misa, different, interpretations, of, the, concept, of, nas, have, been, proposed, some, scholars, both, muslim, and, western, maintain, that, the, pre, islamic, calendar, used, in, central, arabia, was, a, purely, lunar, calendar, similar, to, the, modern, islamic, calendar, according, to, this, view, nas, is, related, to, the, pre, islamic, practices, of, the, meccan, arabs, where, they, would, alter, the, distribution, of, the, forbidden, months, within, a, given, year, without, implying, a, calendar, manipulation, this, interpretation, is, supported, by, arab, historians, and, lexicographers, like, ibn, hisham, ibn, manzur, and, the, corpus, of, qur, anic, exegesis, this, is, corroborated, by, an, early, sabaic, inscription, where, a, religious, ritual, was, postponed, ns, w, due, to, war, according, to, the, context, of, this, inscription, the, verb, ns, has, nothing, to, do, with, intercalation, but, only, with, moving, religious, events, within, the, calendar, itself, the, similarity, between, the, religious, concept, of, this, ancient, inscription, and, the, qur, an, suggests, that, non, calendaring, postponement, is, also, the, qur, anic, meaning, of, nas, the, encyclopaedia, of, islam, concludes, the, arabic, system, of, can, only, have, been, intended, to, move, the, hajj, and, the, fairs, associated, with, it, in, the, vicinity, of, mecca, to, a, suitable, season, of, the, year, it, was, not, intended, to, establish, a, fixed, calendar, to, be, generally, observed, the, term, fixed, calendar, is, generally, understood, to, refer, to, the, non, intercalated, calendar, others, concur, that, it, was, originally, a, lunar, calendar, but, suggest, that, about, 200, years, before, the, hijra, it, was, transformed, into, a, lunisolar, calendar, containing, an, intercalary, month, added, from, time, to, time, to, keep, the, pilgrimage, within, the, season, of, the, year, when, merchandise, was, most, abundant, this, interpretation, was, first, proposed, by, the, medieval, muslim, astrologer, and, astronomer, abu, ma, shar, al, balkhi, and, later, by, al, biruni, al, mas, udi, and, some, western, scholars, this, interpretation, considers, nas, to, be, a, synonym, to, the, arabic, word, for, intercalation, kab, sa, the, arabs, according, to, one, explanation, mentioned, by, abu, ma, shar, learned, of, this, type, of, intercalation, from, the, jews, the, jewish, nasi, was, the, official, who, decided, when, to, intercalate, the, jewish, calendar, some, sources, say, that, the, arabs, followed, the, jewish, practice, and, intercalated, seven, months, over, nineteen, years, or, else, that, they, intercalated, nine, months, over, 24, years, there, is, however, no, consensus, among, scholars, on, this, issue, nasi, is, interpreted, to, signify, either, the, postponement, of, the, pre, islamic, month, of, hajj, or, the, also, pre, islamic, practice, of, intercalation, periodic, insertion, of, an, additional, month, to, reset, the, calendar, into, accordance, with, the, seasons, in, the, tenth, year, of, the, hijra, as, documented, in, the, qur, an, surah, at, tawbah, 9, 36, 37, muslims, believe, god, revealed, the, prohibition, of, the, nas, indeed, the, number, of, months, ordained, by, allah, is, twelve, in, allah, s, record, since, the, day, he, created, the, heavens, and, the, earth, of, which, four, are, sacred, that, is, the, right, way, so, do, not, wrong, one, another, during, these, months, and, together, fight, the, polytheists, as, they, fight, against, you, together, and, know, that, allah, is, with, those, mindful, of, him, reallocating, the, sanctity, of, these, months, is, an, increase, in, disbelief, by, which, the, disbelievers, are, led, far, astray, they, adjust, the, sanctity, one, year, and, uphold, it, in, another, only, to, maintain, the, number, of, months, sanctified, by, allah, violating, the, very, months, allah, has, made, sacred, their, evil, deeds, have, been, made, appealing, to, them, and, allah, does, not, guide, the, disbelieving, people, the, prohibition, of, nas, would, presumably, have, been, announced, when, the, intercalated, month, had, returned, to, its, position, just, before, the, month, of, nasi, began, if, nas, meant, intercalation, then, the, number, and, the, position, of, the, intercalary, months, between, ah, 1, and, ah, 10, are, uncertain, western, calendar, dates, commonly, cited, for, key, events, in, early, islam, such, as, the, hijra, the, battle, of, badr, the, battle, of, uhud, and, the, battle, of, the, trench, should, be, viewed, with, caution, as, they, might, be, in, error, by, one, two, three, or, even, four, lunar, months, this, prohibition, was, mentioned, by, muhammad, during, the, farewell, sermon, which, was, delivered, on, 9, dhu, al, hijjah, ah, 10, julian, date, friday, 6, march, 632, ce, on, mount, arafat, during, the, farewell, pilgrimage, to, mecca, certainly, the, nasi, is, an, impious, addition, which, has, led, the, infidels, into, error, one, year, they, authorise, the, nasi, another, year, they, forbid, it, they, observe, the, divine, precept, with, respect, to, the, number, of, the, sacred, months, but, in, fact, they, profane, that, which, god, has, declared, to, be, inviolable, and, sanctify, that, which, god, has, declared, to, be, profane, assuredly, time, in, its, revolution, has, returned, to, such, as, it, was, at, the, creation, of, the, heavens, and, the, earth, in, the, eyes, of, god, the, number, of, the, months, is, twelve, among, these, twelve, months, four, are, sacred, namely, rajab, which, stands, alone, and, three, others, which, are, consecutive, the, three, successive, sacred, forbidden, months, mentioned, by, muhammad, months, in, which, battles, are, forbidden, are, dhu, al, qa, dah, dhu, al, hijjah, and, muharram, months, 11, 12, and, 1, respectively, the, single, forbidden, month, is, rajab, month, 7, these, months, were, considered, forbidden, both, within, the, new, islamic, calendar, and, within, the, old, pagan, meccan, calendar, traditionally, the, islamic, day, begins, at, sunset, and, ends, at, the, next, sunset, each, islamic, day, thus, begins, at, nightfall, and, ends, at, the, end, of, daylight, the, days, in, the, seven, day, week, are, with, the, exception, of, the, last, two, days, named, after, their, ordinal, place, in, the, week, on, the, sixth, day, of, the, week, the, gathering, day, yawm, al, jum, ah, muslims, assemble, for, the, friday, prayer, at, a, local, mosque, at, noon, the, gathering, day, is, often, regarded, as, the, weekly, day, off, this, is, frequently, made, official, with, many, muslim, countries, adopting, friday, and, saturday, e, g, egypt, saudi, arabia, or, thursday, and, friday, as, official, weekends, during, which, offices, are, closed, other, countries, e, g, iran, choose, to, make, friday, alone, a, day, of, rest, a, few, others, e, g, turkey, pakistan, morocco, nigeria, malaysia, have, adopted, the, saturday, sunday, weekend, while, making, friday, a, working, day, with, a, long, midday, break, to, allow, time, off, for, worship, each, month, of, the, islamic, calendar, commences, on, the, birth, of, the, new, lunar, cycle, traditionally, this, is, based, on, actual, observation, of, the, moon, s, crescent, hilal, marking, the, end, of, the, previous, lunar, cycle, and, hence, the, previous, month, thereby, beginning, the, new, month, consequently, each, month, can, have, 29, or, 30, days, depending, on, the, visibility, of, the, moon, astronomical, positioning, of, the, earth, and, weather, conditions, four, of, the, twelve, hijri, months, are, considered, sacred, rajab, 7, and, the, three, consecutive, months, of, dh, al, qa, dah, 11, dhu, al, ijjah, 12, and, mu, arram, 1, the, afghan, lunar, calendar, refers, to, two, distinct, naming, systems, for, the, months, of, the, hijri, calendar, one, of, which, was, used, by, the, pashtuns, and, the, other, by, the, hazaras, they, were, in, use, until, the, time, of, amanullah, khan, s, reign, when, the, usage, of, the, solar, hijri, calendar, was, formalized, across, afghanistan, in, xinjiang, the, uyghur, muslims, traditionally, had, different, names, for, the, months, of, the, hijri, calendar, which, were, in, use, until, the, adoption, of, the, gregorian, calendar, in, the, 20th, century, these, names, were, collectively, referred, to, as, the, turki, lunar, year, or, turki, lunar, calendar, or, rab, a, l, l, or, rab, a, l, khir, or, jum, d, l, l, or, jum, d, l, khirah, or, b, r, t, ay, twelver, shia, muslims, believe, the, islamic, new, year, and, first, month, of, the, hijri, calendar, is, rabi, al, awwal, rather, than, muharram, due, to, it, being, the, month, in, which, the, hijrah, took, place, this, has, led, to, difference, regarding, description, of, the, years, in, which, some, events, took, place, such, as, the, muharram, occurring, battle, of, karbala, which, shias, say, took, place, in, 60, ah, while, sunnis, say, it, took, place, in, 61, ah, the, mean, duration, of, a, tropical, year, is, 365, 24219, days, while, the, long, term, average, duration, of, a, synodic, month, is, 29, 530587981, days, thus, the, average, lunar, year, twelve, new, moons, is, 10, 87513, days, shorter, than, the, average, solar, year, 365, 24219, 12, 29, 530587981, causing, months, of, the, hijri, calendar, to, advance, about, eleven, days, earlier, each, year, relative, to, the, equinoxes, as, a, result, says, the, astronomical, almanac, the, cycle, of, twelve, lunar, months, regresses, through, the, seasons, over, a, period, of, about, 33, years, in, pre, islamic, arabia, it, was, customary, to, identify, a, year, after, a, major, event, which, took, place, in, it, thus, according, to, islamic, tradition, abraha, governor, of, yemen, then, a, province, of, the, christian, kingdom, of, aksum, of, northeast, africa, and, south, arabia, attempted, to, destroy, the, kaaba, with, an, army, which, included, several, elephants, the, raid, was, unsuccessful, but, that, year, became, known, as, the, year, of, the, elephant, during, which, muhammad, was, born, surah, al, fil, most, equate, this, to, the, year, 570, ce, but, a, minority, use, 571, ce, the, first, ten, years, of, the, hijra, were, not, numbered, but, were, named, after, events, in, the, life, of, muhammad, according, to, al, biruni, in, c, 638, 17, ah, abu, musa, al, ash, ari, one, of, the, officials, of, the, rashid, caliph, umar, r, 634, 644, in, basra, complained, about, the, absence, of, any, years, on, the, correspondence, he, received, from, umar, making, it, difficult, for, him, to, determine, which, instructions, were, most, recent, this, report, convinced, umar, of, the, need, to, introduce, an, era, for, muslims, after, debating, the, issue, with, his, counsellors, he, decided, that, the, first, year, should, be, the, year, of, muhammad, s, arrival, at, medina, known, as, yathrib, before, muhammad, s, arrival, uthman, then, suggested, that, the, months, begin, with, muharram, in, line, with, the, established, custom, of, the, arabs, at, that, time, the, years, of, the, islamic, calendar, thus, began, with, the, month, of, muharram, in, the, year, of, muhammad, s, arrival, at, the, city, of, medina, even, though, the, actual, emigration, took, place, in, safar, and, rabi, i, of, the, intercalated, calendar, two, months, before, the, commencement, of, muharram, in, the, new, fixed, calendar, because, of, the, hijra, the, calendar, was, named, the, hijri, calendar, f, a, shamsi, 1984, postulated, that, the, arabic, calendar, was, never, intercalated, according, to, him, the, first, day, of, the, first, month, of, the, new, fixed, islamic, calendar, 1, muharram, ah, 1, was, no, different, from, what, was, observed, at, the, time, the, day, the, prophet, moved, from, quba, to, medina, was, originally, 26, rabi, i, on, the, pre, islamic, calendar, 1, muharram, of, the, new, fixed, calendar, corresponded, to, friday, 16, july, 622, ce, the, equivalent, civil, tabular, date, same, daylight, period, in, the, julian, calendar, the, islamic, day, began, at, the, preceding, sunset, on, the, evening, of, 15, july, this, julian, date, 16, july, was, determined, by, medieval, muslim, astronomers, by, projecting, back, in, time, their, own, tabular, islamic, calendar, which, had, alternating, 30, and, 29, day, months, in, each, lunar, year, plus, eleven, leap, days, every, 30, years, for, example, al, biruni, mentioned, this, julian, date, in, the, year, 1000, ce, although, not, used, by, either, medieval, muslim, astronomers, or, modern, scholars, to, determine, the, islamic, epoch, the, thin, crescent, moon, would, have, also, first, become, visible, assuming, clouds, did, not, obscure, it, shortly, after, the, preceding, sunset, on, the, evening, of, 15, july, 1, 5, days, after, the, associated, dark, moon, astronomical, new, moon, on, the, morning, of, 14, july, though, michael, cook, and, patricia, crone, in, their, book, hagarism, cite, a, coin, from, ah, 17, the, first, surviving, attested, use, of, a, hijri, calendar, date, alongside, a, date, in, another, calendar, coptic, is, on, a, papyrus, from, egypt, in, ah, 22, perf, 558, due, to, the, islamic, calendar, s, reliance, on, certain, variable, methods, of, observation, to, determine, its, month, start, dates, these, dates, sometimes, vary, slightly, from, the, month, start, dates, of, the, astronomical, lunar, calendar, which, are, based, directly, on, astronomical, calculations, still, the, islamic, calendar, roughly, approximates, the, astronomical, lunar, calendar, system, seldom, varying, by, more, than, three, days, from, it, both, the, islamic, calendar, and, the, astronomical, lunar, calendar, take, no, account, of, the, solar, year, in, their, calculations, and, thus, both, of, these, strictly, lunar, based, calendar, systems, have, no, ability, to, reckon, the, timing, of, the, four, seasons, of, the, year, in, the, astronomical, lunar, calendar, system, a, year, of, 12, lunar, months, is, 354, 37, days, long, in, this, calendar, system, lunar, months, begin, precisely, at, the, time, of, the, monthly, conjunction, when, the, moon, is, located, most, directly, between, the, earth, and, the, sun, the, month, is, defined, as, the, average, duration, of, a, revolution, of, the, moon, around, the, earth, 29, 53, days, by, convention, months, of, 30, days, and, 29, days, succeed, each, other, adding, up, over, two, successive, months, to, 59, full, days, this, leaves, only, a, small, monthly, variation, of, 44, minutes, to, account, for, which, adds, up, to, a, total, of, 24, hours, i, e, the, equivalent, of, one, full, day, in, 2, 73, years, to, settle, accounts, it, is, sufficient, to, add, one, day, every, three, years, to, the, lunar, calendar, in, the, same, way, that, one, adds, one, day, to, the, gregorian, calendar, every, four, years, the, technical, details, of, the, adjustment, are, described, in, tabular, islamic, calendar, the, islamic, calendar, however, is, based, on, a, different, set, of, conventions, being, used, for, the, determination, of, the, month, start, dates, each, month, still, has, either, 29, or, 30, days, but, due, to, the, variable, method, of, observations, employed, there, is, usually, no, discernible, order, in, the, sequencing, of, either, 29, or, 30, day, month, lengths, traditionally, the, first, day, of, each, month, is, the, day, beginning, at, sunset, of, the, first, sighting, of, the, hilal, crescent, moon, shortly, after, sunset, if, the, hilal, is, not, observed, immediately, after, the, 29th, day, of, a, month, either, because, clouds, block, its, view, or, because, the, western, sky, is, still, too, bright, when, the, moon, sets, then, the, day, that, begins, at, that, sunset, is, the, 30th, such, a, sighting, has, to, be, made, by, one, or, more, trustworthy, men, testifying, before, a, committee, of, muslim, leaders, determining, the, most, likely, day, that, the, hilal, could, be, observed, was, a, motivation, for, muslim, interest, in, astronomy, which, put, islam, in, the, forefront, of, that, science, for, many, centuries, still, due, to, the, fact, that, both, lunar, reckoning, systems, are, ultimately, based, on, the, lunar, cycle, itself, both, systems, still, do, roughly, correspond, to, one, another, never, being, more, than, three, days, out, of, synchronisation, with, one, another, this, traditional, practice, for, the, determination, of, the, start, date, of, the, month, is, still, followed, in, the, overwhelming, majority, of, muslim, countries, for, instance, saudi, arabia, uses, the, sighting, method, to, determine, the, beginning, of, each, month, of, the, hijri, calendar, since, ah, 1419, 1998, 99, several, official, hilal, sighting, committees, have, been, set, up, by, the, government, to, determine, the, first, visual, sighting, of, the, lunar, crescent, at, the, beginning, of, each, lunar, month, nevertheless, the, religious, authorities, also, allow, the, testimony, of, less, experienced, observers, and, thus, often, announce, the, sighting, of, the, lunar, crescent, on, a, date, when, none, of, the, official, committees, could, see, it, each, islamic, state, proceeds, with, its, own, monthly, observation, of, the, new, moon, or, failing, that, awaits, the, completion, of, 30, days, before, declaring, the, beginning, of, a, new, month, on, its, territory, however, the, lunar, crescent, becomes, visible, only, some, 17, hours, after, the, conjunction, and, only, subject, to, the, existence, of, a, number, of, favourable, conditions, relative, to, weather, time, geographic, location, as, well, as, various, astronomical, parameters, given, the, fact, that, the, moon, sets, progressively, later, than, the, sun, as, one, goes, west, with, a, corresponding, increase, in, its, age, since, conjunction, western, muslim, countries, may, under, favorable, conditions, observe, the, new, moon, one, day, earlier, than, eastern, muslim, countries, due, to, the, interplay, of, all, these, factors, the, beginning, of, each, month, differs, from, one, muslim, country, to, another, during, the, 48, hour, period, following, the, conjunction, the, information, provided, by, the, calendar, in, any, country, does, not, extend, beyond, the, current, month, a, number, of, muslim, countries, try, to, overcome, some, of, these, difficulties, by, applying, different, astronomy, related, rules, to, determine, the, beginning, of, months, thus, malaysia, indonesia, and, a, few, others, begin, each, month, at, sunset, on, the, first, day, that, the, moon, sets, after, the, sun, moonset, after, sunset, in, egypt, the, month, begins, at, sunset, on, the, first, day, that, the, moon, sets, at, least, five, minutes, after, the, sun, a, detailed, analysis, of, the, available, data, shows, however, that, there, are, major, discrepancies, between, what, countries, say, they, do, on, this, subject, and, what, they, actually, do, in, some, instances, what, a, country, says, it, does, is, impossible, due, to, the, somewhat, variable, nature, of, the, islamic, calendar, in, most, muslim, countries, the, islamic, calendar, is, used, primarily, for, religious, purposes, while, the, solar, based, gregorian, calendar, is, still, used, primarily, for, matters, of, commerce, and, agriculture, if, the, islamic, calendar, were, prepared, using, astronomical, calculations, muslims, throughout, the, muslim, world, could, use, it, to, meet, all, their, needs, the, way, they, use, the, gregorian, calendar, today, but, there, are, divergent, views, on, whether, it, is, licit, to, do, so, a, majority, of, theologians, oppose, the, use, of, calculations, beyond, the, constraint, that, each, month, must, be, not, less, than, 29, nor, more, than, 30, days, on, the, grounds, that, the, latter, would, not, conform, with, muhammad, s, recommendation, to, observe, the, new, moon, of, ramadan, and, shawal, in, order, to, determine, the, beginning, of, these, months, however, some, islamic, jurists, see, no, contradiction, between, muhammad, s, teachings, and, the, use, of, calculations, to, determine, the, beginnings, of, lunar, months, they, consider, that, muhammad, s, recommendation, was, adapted, to, the, culture, of, the, times, and, should, not, be, confused, with, the, acts, of, worship, thus, the, jurists, ahmad, muhammad, shakir, and, yusuf, al, qaradawi, both, endorsed, the, use, of, calculations, to, determine, the, beginning, of, all, months, of, the, islamic, calendar, in, 1939, and, 2004, respectively, so, did, the, fiqh, council, of, north, america, fcna, in, 2006, and, the, european, council, for, fatwa, and, research, ecfr, in, 2007, the, major, muslim, associations, of, france, also, announced, in, 2012, that, they, would, henceforth, use, a, calendar, based, on, astronomical, calculations, taking, into, account, the, criteria, of, the, possibility, of, crescent, sighting, in, any, place, on, earth, but, shortly, after, the, official, adoption, of, this, rule, by, the, french, council, of, the, muslim, faith, cfcm, in, 2013, the, new, leadership, of, the, association, decided, on, the, eve, of, ramadan, 2013, to, follow, the, saudi, announcement, rather, than, to, apply, the, rule, just, adopted, this, resulted, in, a, division, of, the, muslim, community, of, france, with, some, members, following, the, new, rule, and, others, following, the, saudi, announcement, isma, ili, taiyebi, bohras, having, the, institution, of, da, i, al, mutlaq, follow, the, tabular, islamic, calendar, see, section, below, prepared, on, the, basis, of, astronomical, calculations, from, the, days, of, fatimid, imams, turkish, muslims, use, an, islamic, calendar, which, is, calculated, several, years, in, advance, by, the, turkish, presidency, of, religious, affairs, diyanet, leri, ba, kanl, from, 1, muharrem, 1400, ah, 21, november, 1979, until, 29, zilhicce, 1435, 24, october, 2014, the, computed, turkish, lunar, calendar, was, based, on, the, following, rule, the, lunar, month, is, assumed, to, begin, on, the, evening, when, within, some, region, of, the, terrestrial, globe, the, computed, centre, of, the, lunar, crescent, at, local, sunset, is, more, than, 5, above, the, local, horizon, and, geocentrically, more, than, 8, from, the, sun, in, the, current, rule, the, computed, lunar, crescent, has, to, be, above, the, local, horizon, of, ankara, at, sunset, saudi, arabia, has, traditionally, used, the, umm, al, qura, calendar, which, is, based, on, astronomical, calculations, for, administrative, purposes, the, parameters, used, in, the, establishment, of, this, calendar, underwent, significant, changes, during, the, decade, to, ah, 1423, before, ah, 1420, before, 18, april, 1999, if, the, moon, s, age, at, sunset, in, riyadh, was, at, least, 12, hours, then, the, day, ending, at, that, sunset, was, the, first, day, of, the, month, this, often, caused, the, saudis, to, celebrate, holy, days, one, or, even, two, days, before, other, predominantly, muslim, countries, including, the, dates, for, the, hajj, which, can, only, be, dated, using, saudi, dates, because, it, is, performed, in, mecca, from, ah, 1420, 22, if, moonset, occurred, after, sunset, at, mecca, then, the, day, beginning, at, that, sunset, was, the, first, day, of, a, saudi, month, essentially, the, same, rule, used, by, malaysia, indonesia, and, others, except, for, the, location, from, which, the, hilal, was, observed, since, the, beginning, of, ah, 1423, 16, march, 2002, the, rule, has, been, clarified, a, little, by, requiring, the, geocentric, conjunction, of, the, sun, and, moon, to, occur, before, sunset, in, addition, to, requiring, moonset, to, occur, after, sunset, at, mecca, this, ensures, that, the, moon, has, moved, past, the, sun, by, sunset, even, though, the, sky, may, still, be, too, bright, immediately, before, moonset, to, actually, see, the, crescent, in, 2007, the, islamic, society, of, north, america, the, fiqh, council, of, north, america, and, the, european, council, for, fatwa, and, research, announced, that, they, would, henceforth, use, a, calendar, based, on, calculations, using, the, same, parameters, as, the, umm, al, qura, calendar, to, determine, well, in, advance, the, beginning, of, all, lunar, months, and, therefore, the, days, associated, with, all, religious, observances, this, was, intended, as, a, first, step, on, the, way, to, unify, at, some, future, time, muslims, calendars, throughout, the, world, on, 14, february, 2016, saudi, arabia, adopted, the, gregorian, calendar, for, payment, of, the, monthly, salaries, of, government, employees, as, a, cost, cutting, measure, while, retaining, the, islamic, calendar, for, religious, purposes, the, solar, hijri, calendar, is, a, solar, calendar, used, in, iran, which, counts, its, years, from, the, hijra, or, migration, of, muhammad, from, mecca, to, medina, in, 622, ce, the, tabular, islamic, calendar, is, a, rule, based, variation, of, the, islamic, calendar, in, which, months, are, worked, out, by, arithmetic, rules, rather, than, by, observation, or, astronomical, calculation, it, has, a, 30, year, cycle, with, 11, leap, years, of, 355, days, and, 19, years, of, 354, days, in, the, long, term, it, is, accurate, to, one, day, in, about, 2, 500, solar, years, or, 2, 570, lunar, years, it, also, deviates, up, to, about, one, or, two, days, in, the, short, term, microsoft, uses, the, kuwaiti, algorithm, a, variant, of, the, tabular, islamic, calendar, to, convert, gregorian, dates, to, the, islamic, ones, microsoft, claimed, that, the, variant, is, based, on, a, statistical, analysis, of, historical, data, from, kuwait, however, it, matches, a, known, tabular, calendar, important, dates, in, the, islamic, hijri, year, are, days, considered, important, predominantly, for, shia, muslims, the, islamic, calendar, is, now, used, primarily, for, religious, purposes, and, for, official, dating, of, public, events, and, documents, in, muslim, countries, because, of, its, nature, as, a, purely, lunar, calendar, it, cannot, be, used, for, agricultural, purposes, and, historically, islamic, communities, have, used, other, calendars, for, this, purpose, the, egyptian, calendar, was, formerly, widespread, in, islamic, countries, and, the, iranian, calendar, and, the, 1789, ottoman, calendar, a, modified, julian, calendar, were, also, used, for, agriculture, in, their, countries, in, the, levant, and, iraq, the, aramaic, names, of, the, babylonian, calendar, are, still, used, for, all, secular, matters, in, the, maghreb, berber, farmers, in, the, countryside, still, use, the, julian, calendar, for, agrarian, purposes, these, local, solar, calendars, have, receded, in, importance, with, the, near, universal, adoption, of, the, gregorian, calendar, for, civil, purposes, saudi, arabia, uses, the, lunar, islamic, calendar, in, indonesia, the, javanese, calendar, combines, elements, of, the, islamic, and, pre, islamic, saka, calendars, british, author, nicholas, hagger, writes, that, after, seizing, control, of, libya, muammar, gaddafi, declared, on, 1, december, 1978, that, the, muslim, calendar, should, start, with, the, death, of, the, prophet, mohammed, in, 632, rather, than, the, hijra, mohammed, s, emigration, from, mecca, to, medina, in, 622, this, put, the, country, ten, solar, years, behind, the, standard, muslim, calendar, however, according, to, the, 2006, encyclopedia, of, the, developing, world, more, confusing, still, is, qaddafi, s, unique, libyan, calendar, which, counts, the, years, from, the, prophet, s, birth, or, sometimes, from, his, death, the, months, july, and, august, named,

was, so, unpredictable, that, people, weren, t, even, sure, what, year, it, was, the, year, of, my, visit, was, officially, 1369, but, just, two, years, earlier, libyans, had, been, living, through, 1429, no, one, could, quite, name, for, me, the, day, the, count, changed, especially, since, both, remained, in, play, event, organizers, threw, up, their, hands, and, put, the, western, year, in,
