a, computer, mouse, plural, mice, also, mouses, is, a, hand, held, pointing, device, that, detects, two, dimensional, motion, relative, to, a, surface, this, motion, is, typically, translated, into, the, motion, of, the, pointer, called, a, cursor, on, a, display, which, allows, a, smooth, control, of, the, graphical, user, interface, of, a, computer, the, first, public, demonstration, of, a, mouse, controlling, a, computer, system, was, done, by, doug, engelbart, in, 1968, as, part, of, the, mother, of, all, demos, mice, originally, used, two, separate, wheels, to, directly, track, movement, across, a, surface, one, in, the, x, dimension, and, one, in, the, y, later, the, standard, design, shifted, to, use, a, ball, rolling, on, a, surface, to, detect, motion, in, turn, connected, to, internal, rollers, most, modern, mice, use, optical, movement, detection, with, no, moving, parts, though, originally, all, mice, were, connected, to, a, computer, by, a, cable, many, modern, mice, are, cordless, relying, on, short, range, radio, communication, with, the, connected, system, in, addition, to, moving, a, cursor, computer, mice, have, one, or, more, buttons, to, allow, operations, such, as, the, selection, of, a, menu, item, on, a, display, mice, often, also, feature, other, elements, such, as, touch, surfaces, and, scroll, wheels, which, enable, additional, control, and, dimensional, input, the, earliest, known, written, use, of, the, term, mouse, or, mice, in, reference, to, a, computer, pointing, device, is, in, bill, english, s, july, 1965, publication, computer, aided, display, control, this, likely, originated, from, its, resemblance, to, the, shape, and, size, of, a, mouse, with, the, cord, resembling, its, tail, the, popularity, of, wireless, mice, without, cords, makes, the, resemblance, less, obvious, according, to, roger, bates, a, hardware, designer, under, english, the, term, also, came, about, because, the, cursor, on, the, screen, was, for, an, unknown, reason, referred, to, as, cat, and, was, seen, by, the, team, as, if, it, would, be, chasing, the, new, desktop, device, the, plural, for, the, small, rodent, is, always, mice, in, modern, usage, the, plural, for, a, computer, mouse, is, either, mice, or, mouses, according, to, most, dictionaries, with, mice, being, more, common, the, first, recorded, plural, usage, is, mice, the, online, oxford, dictionaries, cites, a, 1984, use, and, earlier, uses, include, j, c, r, licklider, s, the, computer, as, a, communication, device, of, 1968, the, trackball, a, related, pointing, device, was, invented, in, 1946, by, ralph, benjamin, as, part, of, a, post, world, war, ii, era, fire, control, radar, plotting, system, called, the, comprehensive, display, system, cds, benjamin, was, then, working, for, the, british, royal, navy, scientific, service, benjamin, s, project, used, analog, computers, to, calculate, the, future, position, of, target, aircraft, based, on, several, initial, input, points, provided, by, a, user, with, a, joystick, benjamin, felt, that, a, more, elegant, input, device, was, needed, and, invented, what, they, called, a, roller, ball, for, this, purpose, the, device, was, patented, in, 1947, but, only, a, prototype, using, a, metal, ball, rolling, on, two, rubber, coated, wheels, was, ever, built, and, the, device, was, kept, as, a, military, secret, another, early, trackball, was, built, by, kenyon, taylor, a, british, electrical, engineer, working, in, collaboration, with, tom, cranston, and, fred, longstaff, taylor, was, part, of, the, original, ferranti, canada, working, on, the, royal, canadian, navy, s, datar, digital, automated, tracking, and, resolving, system, in, 1952, datar, was, similar, in, concept, to, benjamin, s, display, the, trackball, used, four, disks, to, pick, up, motion, two, each, for, the, x, and, y, directions, several, rollers, provided, mechanical, support, when, the, ball, was, rolled, the, pickup, discs, spun, and, contacts, on, their, outer, rim, made, periodic, contact, with, wires, producing, pulses, of, output, with, each, movement, of, the, ball, by, counting, the, pulses, the, physical, movement, of, the, ball, could, be, determined, a, digital, computer, calculated, the, tracks, and, sent, the, resulting, data, to, other, ships, in, a, task, force, using, pulse, code, modulation, radio, signals, this, trackball, used, a, standard, canadian, five, pin, bowling, ball, it, was, not, patented, since, it, was, a, secret, military, project, douglas, engelbart, of, the, stanford, research, institute, now, sri, international, has, been, credited, in, published, books, by, thierry, bardini, paul, ceruzzi, howard, rheingold, and, several, others, as, the, inventor, of, the, computer, mouse, engelbart, was, also, recognized, as, such, in, various, obituary, titles, after, his, death, in, july, 2013, by, 1963, engelbart, had, already, established, a, research, lab, at, sri, the, augmentation, research, center, arc, to, pursue, his, objective, of, developing, both, hardware, and, software, computer, technology, to, augment, human, intelligence, that, november, while, attending, a, conference, on, computer, graphics, in, reno, nevada, engelbart, began, to, ponder, how, to, adapt, the, underlying, principles, of, the, planimeter, to, inputting, x, and, y, coordinate, data, on, 14, november, 1963, he, first, recorded, his, thoughts, in, his, personal, notebook, about, something, he, initially, called, a, bug, which, is, a, 3, point, form, could, have, a, drop, point, and, 2, orthogonal, wheels, he, wrote, that, the, bug, would, be, easier, and, more, natural, to, use, and, unlike, a, stylus, it, would, stay, still, when, let, go, which, meant, it, would, be, much, better, for, coordination, with, the, keyboard, in, 1964, bill, english, joined, arc, where, he, helped, engelbart, build, the, first, mouse, prototype, they, christened, the, device, the, mouse, as, early, models, had, a, cord, attached, to, the, rear, part, of, the, device, which, looked, like, a, tail, and, in, turn, resembled, the, common, mouse, according, to, roger, bates, a, hardware, designer, in, english, another, reason, for, choosing, this, name, was, because, the, cursor, on, the, screen, was, also, referred, to, as, cat, at, this, time, as, noted, above, this, mouse, was, first, mentioned, in, print, in, a, july, 1965, report, on, which, english, was, the, lead, author, on, 9, december, 1968, engelbart, publicly, demonstrated, the, mouse, at, what, would, come, to, be, known, as, the, mother, of, all, demos, engelbart, never, received, any, royalties, for, it, as, his, employer, sri, held, the, patent, which, expired, before, the, mouse, became, widely, used, in, personal, computers, in, any, event, the, invention, of, the, mouse, was, just, a, small, part, of, engelbart, s, much, larger, project, of, augmenting, human, intellect, several, other, experimental, pointing, devices, developed, for, engelbart, s, on, line, system, nls, exploited, different, body, movements, for, example, head, mounted, devices, attached, to, the, chin, or, nose, but, ultimately, the, mouse, won, out, because, of, its, speed, and, convenience, the, first, mouse, a, bulky, device, pictured, used, two, potentiometers, perpendicular, to, each, other, and, connected, to, wheels, the, rotation, of, each, wheel, translated, into, motion, along, one, axis, at, the, time, of, the, mother, of, all, demos, engelbart, s, group, had, been, using, their, second, generation, 3, button, mouse, for, about, a, year, on, 2, october, 1968, three, years, after, engelbart, s, prototype, but, more, than, two, months, before, his, public, demo, a, mouse, device, named, rollkugelsteuerung, german, for, trackball, control, was, shown, in, a, sales, brochure, by, the, german, company, aeg, telefunken, as, an, optional, input, device, for, the, sig, 100, vector, graphics, terminal, part, of, the, system, around, their, process, computer, tr, 86, and, the, tr, 440, main, frame, based, on, an, even, earlier, trackball, device, the, mouse, device, had, been, developed, by, the, company, in, 1966, in, what, had, been, a, parallel, and, independent, discovery, as, the, name, suggests, and, unlike, engelbart, s, mouse, the, telefunken, model, already, had, a, ball, diameter, 40, mm, weight, 40, g, and, two, mechanical, 4, bit, rotational, position, transducers, with, gray, code, like, states, allowing, easy, movement, in, any, direction, the, bits, remained, stable, for, at, least, two, successive, states, to, relax, debouncing, requirements, this, arrangement, was, chosen, so, that, the, data, could, also, be, transmitted, to, the, tr, 86, front, end, process, computer, and, over, longer, distance, telex, lines, with, c, 50, baud, weighing, 465, grams, 16, 4, oz, the, device, with, a, total, height, of, about, 7, cm, 2, 8, in, came, in, a, c, 12, cm, 4, 7, in, diameter, hemispherical, injection, molded, thermoplastic, casing, featuring, one, central, push, button, as, noted, above, the, device, was, based, on, an, earlier, trackball, like, device, also, named, rollkugel, that, was, embedded, into, radar, flight, control, desks, this, trackball, had, been, originally, developed, by, a, team, led, by, rainer, mallebrein, at, telefunken, konstanz, for, the, german, bundesanstalt, f, r, flugsicherung, federal, air, traffic, control, it, was, part, of, the, corresponding, workstation, system, sap, 300, and, the, terminal, sig, 3001, which, had, been, designed, and, developed, since, 1963, development, for, the, tr, 440, main, frame, began, in, 1965, this, led, to, the, development, of, the, tr, 86, process, computer, system, with, its, sig, 100, 86, terminal, inspired, by, a, discussion, with, a, university, customer, mallebrein, came, up, with, the, idea, of, reversing, the, existing, rollkugel, trackball, into, a, moveable, mouse, like, device, in, 1966, so, that, customers, did, not, have, to, be, bothered, with, mounting, holes, for, the, earlier, trackball, device, the, device, was, finished, in, early, 1968, and, together, with, light, pens, and, trackballs, it, was, commercially, offered, as, an, optional, input, device, for, their, system, starting, later, that, year, not, all, customers, opted, to, buy, the, device, which, added, costs, of, dm, 1, 500, per, piece, to, the, already, up, to, 20, million, dm, deal, for, the, main, frame, of, which, only, a, total, of, 46, systems, were, sold, or, leased, they, were, installed, at, more, than, 20, german, universities, including, rwth, aachen, technische, universit, t, berlin, university, of, stuttgart, and, konstanz, several, rollkugel, mice, installed, at, the, leibniz, supercomputing, centre, in, munich, in, 1972, are, well, preserved, in, a, museum, two, others, survived, in, a, museum, at, stuttgart, university, two, in, hamburg, the, one, from, aachen, at, the, computer, history, museum, in, the, us, and, yet, another, sample, was, recently, donated, to, the, heinz, nixdorf, museumsforum, hnf, in, paderborn, anecdotal, reports, claim, that, telefunken, s, attempt, to, patent, the, device, was, rejected, by, the, german, patent, office, due, to, lack, of, inventiveness, for, the, air, traffic, control, system, the, mallebrein, team, had, already, developed, a, precursor, to, touch, screens, in, form, of, an, ultrasonic, curtain, based, pointing, device, in, front, of, the, display, in, 1970, they, developed, a, device, named, touchinput, einrichtung, touch, input, device, based, on, a, conductively, coated, glass, screen, the, xerox, alto, was, one, of, the, first, computers, designed, for, individual, use, in, 1973, and, is, regarded, as, the, first, modern, computer, to, use, a, mouse, alan, kay, designed, the, 16, by, 16, mouse, cursor, icon, with, its, left, edge, vertical, and, right, edge, 45, degrees, so, it, displays, well, on, the, bitmap, inspired, by, parc, s, alto, the, lilith, a, computer, which, had, been, developed, by, a, team, around, niklaus, wirth, at, eth, z, rich, between, 1978, and, 1980, provided, a, mouse, as, well, the, third, marketed, version, of, an, integrated, mouse, shipped, as, a, part, of, a, computer, and, intended, for, personal, computer, navigation, came, with, the, xerox, 8010, star, in, 1981, by, 1982, the, xerox, 8010, was, probably, the, best, known, computer, with, a, mouse, the, sun, 1, also, came, with, a, mouse, and, the, forthcoming, apple, lisa, was, rumored, to, use, one, but, the, peripheral, remained, obscure, jack, hawley, of, the, mouse, house, reported, that, one, buyer, for, a, large, organization, believed, at, first, that, his, company, sold, lab, mice, hawley, who, manufactured, mice, for, xerox, stated, that, practically, i, have, the, market, all, to, myself, right, now, a, hawley, mouse, cost, 415, in, 1982, logitech, introduced, the, p4, mouse, at, the, comdex, trade, show, in, las, vegas, its, first, hardware, mouse, that, same, year, microsoft, made, the, decision, to, make, the, ms, dos, program, microsoft, word, mouse, compatible, and, developed, the, first, pc, compatible, mouse, the, microsoft, mouse, shipped, in, 1983, thus, beginning, the, microsoft, hardware, division, of, the, company, however, the, mouse, remained, relatively, obscure, until, the, appearance, of, the, macintosh, 128k, which, included, an, updated, version, of, the, single, button, lisa, mouse, in, 1984, and, of, the, amiga, 1000, and, the, atari, st, in, 1985, a, mouse, typically, controls, the, motion, of, a, pointer, in, two, dimensions, in, a, graphical, user, interface, gui, the, mouse, turns, movements, of, the, hand, backward, and, forward, left, and, right, into, equivalent, electronic, signals, that, in, turn, are, used, to, move, the, pointer, the, relative, movements, of, the, mouse, on, the, surface, are, applied, to, the, position, of, the, pointer, on, the, screen, which, signals, the, point, where, actions, of, the, user, take, place, so, hand, movements, are, replicated, by, the, pointer, clicking, or, pointing, stopping, movement, while, the, cursor, is, within, the, bounds, of, an, area, can, select, files, programs, or, actions, from, a, list, of, names, or, in, graphical, interfaces, through, small, images, called, icons, and, other, elements, for, example, a, text, file, might, be, represented, by, a, picture, of, a, paper, notebook, and, clicking, while, the, cursor, points, at, this, icon, might, cause, a, text, editing, program, to, open, the, file, in, a, window, different, ways, of, operating, the, mouse, cause, specific, things, to, happen, in, the, gui, the, concept, of, gestural, interfaces, gestural, interfaces, have, become, an, integral, part, of, modern, computing, allowing, users, to, interact, with, their, devices, in, a, more, intuitive, and, natural, way, in, addition, to, traditional, pointing, and, clicking, actions, users, can, now, employ, gestural, inputs, to, issue, commands, or, perform, specific, actions, these, stylized, motions, of, the, mouse, cursor, known, as, gestures, have, the, potential, to, enhance, user, experience, and, streamline, workflow, mouse, gestures, in, action, to, illustrate, the, concept, of, gestural, interfaces, let, s, consider, a, drawing, program, as, an, example, in, this, scenario, a, user, can, employ, a, gesture, to, delete, a, shape, on, the, canvas, by, rapidly, moving, the, mouse, cursor, in, an, x, motion, over, the, shape, the, user, can, trigger, the, command, to, delete, the, selected, shape, this, gesture, based, interaction, enables, users, to, perform, actions, quickly, and, efficiently, without, relying, solely, on, traditional, input, methods, challenges, and, benefits, of, gestural, interfaces, while, gestural, interfaces, offer, a, more, immersive, and, interactive, user, experience, they, also, present, challenges, one, of, the, primary, difficulties, lies, in, the, requirement, of, finer, motor, control, from, users, gestures, demand, precise, movements, which, can, be, more, challenging, for, individuals, with, limited, dexterity, or, those, who, are, new, to, this, mode, of, interaction, however, despite, these, challenges, gestural, interfaces, have, gained, popularity, due, to, their, ability, to, simplify, complex, tasks, and, improve, efficiency, several, gestural, conventions, have, become, widely, adopted, making, them, more, accessible, to, users, one, such, convention, is, the, drag, and, drop, gesture, which, has, become, pervasive, across, various, applications, and, platforms, the, drag, and, drop, gesture, the, drag, and, drop, gesture, is, a, fundamental, gestural, convention, that, enables, users, to, manipulate, objects, on, the, screen, seamlessly, it, involves, a, series, of, actions, performed, by, the, user, this, gesture, allows, users, to, transfer, or, rearrange, objects, effortlessly, for, instance, a, user, can, drag, and, drop, a, picture, representing, a, file, onto, an, image, of, a, trash, can, indicating, the, intention, to, delete, the, file, this, intuitive, and, visual, approach, to, interaction, has, become, synonymous, with, organizing, digital, content, and, simplifying, file, management, tasks, standard, semantic, gestures, in, addition, to, the, drag, and, drop, gesture, several, other, semantic, gestures, have, emerged, as, standard, conventions, within, the, gestural, interface, paradigm, these, gestures, serve, specific, purposes, and, contribute, to, a, more, intuitive, user, experience, some, of, the, notable, semantic, gestures, include, crossing, based, goal, this, gesture, involves, crossing, a, specific, boundary, or, threshold, on, the, screen, to, trigger, an, action, or, complete, a, task, for, example, swiping, across, the, screen, to, unlock, a, device, or, confirm, a, selection, menu, traversal, menu, traversal, gestures, facilitate, navigation, through, hierarchical, menus, or, options, users, can, perform, gestures, such, as, swiping, or, scrolling, to, explore, different, menu, levels, or, activate, specific, commands, pointing, pointing, gestures, involve, positioning, the, mouse, cursor, over, an, object, or, element, to, interact, with, it, this, fundamental, gesture, enables, users, to, select, click, or, access, contextual, menus, mouseover, pointing, or, hovering, mouseover, gestures, occur, when, the, cursor, is, positioned, over, an, object, without, clicking, this, action, often, triggers, a, visual, change, or, displays, additional, information, about, the, object, providing, users, with, real, time, feedback, these, standard, semantic, gestures, along, with, the, drag, and, drop, convention, form, the, building, blocks, of, gestural, interfaces, allowing, users, to, interact, with, digital, content, using, intuitive, and, natural, movements, at, the, end, of, 20th, century, digitizer, mice, puck, with, magnifying, glass, was, used, with, autocad, for, the, digitizations, of, blueprints, other, uses, of, the, mouse, s, input, occur, commonly, in, special, application, domains, in, interactive, three, dimensional, graphics, the, mouse, s, motion, often, translates, directly, into, changes, in, the, virtual, objects, or, camera, s, orientation, for, example, in, the, first, person, shooter, genre, of, games, see, below, players, usually, employ, the, mouse, to, control, the, direction, in, which, the, virtual, player, s, head, faces, moving, the, mouse, up, will, cause, the, player, to, look, up, revealing, the, view, above, the, player, s, head, a, related, function, makes, an, image, of, an, object, rotate, so, that, all, sides, can, be, examined, 3d, design, and, animation, software, often, modally, chord, many, different, combinations, to, allow, objects, and, cameras, to, be, rotated, and, moved, through, space, with, the, few, axes, of, movement, mice, can, detect, when, mice, have, more, than, one, button, the, software, may, assign, different, functions, to, each, button, often, the, primary, leftmost, in, a, right, handed, configuration, button, on, the, mouse, will, select, items, and, the, secondary, rightmost, in, a, right, handed, button, will, bring, up, a, menu, of, alternative, actions, applicable, to, that, item, for, example, on, platforms, with, more, than, one, button, the, mozilla, web, browser, will, follow, a, link, in, response, to, a, primary, button, click, will, bring, up, a, contextual, menu, of, alternative, actions, for, that, link, in, response, to, a, secondary, button, click, and, will, often, open, the, link, in, a, new, tab, or, window, in, response, to, a, click, with, the, tertiary, middle, mouse, button, the, german, company, telefunken, published, on, their, early, ball, mouse, on, 2, october, 1968, telefunken, s, mouse, was, sold, as, optional, equipment, for, their, computer, systems, bill, english, builder, of, engelbart, s, original, mouse, created, a, ball, mouse, in, 1972, while, working, for, xerox, parc, the, ball, mouse, replaced, the, external, wheels, with, a, single, ball, that, could, rotate, in, any, direction, it, came, as, part, of, the, hardware, package, of, the, xerox, alto, computer, perpendicular, chopper, wheels, housed, inside, the, mouse, s, body, chopped, beams, of, light, on, the, way, to, light, sensors, thus, detecting, in, their, turn, the, motion, of, the, ball, this, variant, of, the, mouse, resembled, an, inverted, trackball, and, became, the, predominant, form, used, with, personal, computers, throughout, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, the, xerox, parc, group, also, settled, on, the, modern, technique, of, using, both, hands, to, type, on, a, full, size, keyboard, and, grabbing, the, mouse, when, required, the, ball, mouse, has, two, freely, rotating, rollers, these, are, located, 90, degrees, apart, one, roller, detects, the, forward, backward, motion, of, the, mouse, and, the, other, the, left, right, motion, opposite, the, two, rollers, is, a, third, one, white, in, the, photo, at, 45, degrees, that, is, spring, loaded, to, push, the, ball, against, the, other, two, rollers, each, roller, is, on, the, same, shaft, as, an, encoder, wheel, that, has, slotted, edges, the, slots, interrupt, infrared, light, beams, to, generate, electrical, pulses, that, represent, wheel, movement, each, wheel, s, disc, has, a, pair, of, light, beams, located, so, that, a, given, beam, becomes, interrupted, or, again, starts, to, pass, light, freely, when, the, other, beam, of, the, pair, is, about, halfway, between, changes, simple, logic, circuits, interpret, the, relative, timing, to, indicate, which, direction, the, wheel, is, rotating, this, incremental, rotary, encoder, scheme, is, sometimes, called, quadrature, encoding, of, the, wheel, rotation, as, the, two, optical, sensors, produce, signals, that, are, in, approximately, quadrature, phase, the, mouse, sends, these, signals, to, the, computer, system, via, the, mouse, cable, directly, as, logic, signals, in, very, old, mice, such, as, the, xerox, mice, and, via, a, data, formatting, ic, in, modern, mice, the, driver, software, in, the, system, converts, the, signals, into, motion, of, the, mouse, cursor, along, x, and, y, axes, on, the, computer, screen, the, ball, is, mostly, steel, with, a, precision, spherical, rubber, surface, the, weight, of, the, ball, given, an, appropriate, working, surface, under, the, mouse, provides, a, reliable, grip, so, the, mouse, s, movement, is, transmitted, accurately, ball, mice, and, wheel, mice, were, manufactured, for, xerox, by, jack, hawley, doing, business, as, the, mouse, house, in, berkeley, california, starting, in, 1975, based, on, another, invention, by, jack, hawley, proprietor, of, the, mouse, house, honeywell, produced, another, type, of, mechanical, mouse, instead, of, a, ball, it, had, two, wheels, rotating, at, off, axes, key, tronic, later, produced, a, similar, product, modern, computer, mice, took, form, at, the, cole, polytechnique, f, d, rale, de, lausanne, epfl, under, the, inspiration, of, professor, jean, daniel, nicoud, and, at, the, hands, of, engineer, and, watchmaker, andr, guignard, this, new, design, incorporated, a, single, hard, rubber, mouseball, and, three, buttons, and, remained, a, common, design, until, the, mainstream, adoption, of, the, scroll, wheel, mouse, during, the, 1990s, in, 1985, ren, sommer, added, a, microprocessor, to, nicoud, s, and, guignard, s, design, through, this, innovation, sommer, is, credited, with, inventing, a, significant, component, of, the, mouse, which, made, it, more, intelligent, though, optical, mice, from, mouse, systems, had, incorporated, microprocessors, by, 1984, another, type, of, mechanical, mouse, the, analog, mouse, now, generally, regarded, as, obsolete, uses, potentiometers, rather, than, encoder, wheels, and, is, typically, designed, to, be, plug, compatible, with, an, analog, joystick, the, color, mouse, originally, marketed, by, radioshack, for, their, color, computer, but, also, usable, on, ms, dos, machines, equipped, with, analog, joystick, ports, provided, the, software, accepted, joystick, input, was, the, best, known, example, early, optical, mice, relied, entirely, on, one, or, more, light, emitting,

to, its, optics, a, laser, mouse, is, an, optical, mouse, that, uses, coherent, laser, light, the, earliest, optical, mice, detected, movement, on, pre, printed, mousepad, surfaces, whereas, the, modern, led, optical, mouse, works, on, most, opaque, diffuse, surfaces, it, is, usually, unable, to, detect, movement, on, specular, surfaces, like, polished, stone, laser, diodes, provide, good, resolution, and, precision, improving, performance, on, opaque, specular, surfaces, later, more, surface, independent, optical, mice, use, an, optoelectronic, sensor, essentially, a, tiny, low, resolution, video, camera, to, take, successive, images, of, the, surface, on, which, the, mouse, operates, battery, powered, wireless, optical, mice, flash, the, led, intermittently, to, save, power,

performing, positioning, tasks, with, less, stiffness, than, navigation, tasks, in, 2000, logitech, introduced, a, tactile, mouse, known, as, the, ifeel, mouse, developed, by, immersion, corporation, that, contained, a, small, actuator, to, enable, the, mouse, to, generate, simulated, physical, sensations, such, a, mouse, can, augment, user, interfaces, with, haptic, feedback, such, as, giving, feedback, when, crossing, a, window, boundary, to, surf, the, internet, by, touch, enabled, mouse, was, first, developed, in, 1996, and, first, implemented, commercially, by, the, wingman, force, feedback, mouse, it, requires, the, user, to, be, able, to, feel, depth, or, hardness, this, ability, was, realized, with, the, first, electrorheological, tactile, mice, but, never, marketed, tablet, digitizers, are, sometimes, used, with, accessories, called, pucks, devices, which, rely, on, absolute, positioning, but, can, be, configured, for, sufficiently, mouse, like, relative, tracking, that, they, are, sometimes, marketed, as, mice, as, the, name, suggests, this, type, of, mouse, is, intended, to, provide, optimum, comfort, and, avoid, injuries, such, as, carpal, tunnel, syndrome, arthritis, and, other, repetitive, strain, injuries, it, is, designed, to, fit, natural, hand, position, and, movements, to, reduce, discomfort, when, holding, a, typical, mouse, the, ulna, and, radius, bones, on, the, arm, are, crossed, some, designs, attempt, to, place, the, palm, more, vertically, so, the, bones, take, more, natural, parallel, position, increasing, mouse, height, and, angling, the, mouse, topcase, can, improve, wrist, posture, without, negatively, affecting, performance, some, limit, wrist, movement, encouraging, arm, movement, instead, that, may, be, less, precise, but, more, optimal, from, the, health, point, of, view, a, mouse, may, be, angled, from, the, thumb, downward, to, the, opposite, side, this, is, known, to, reduce, wrist, pronation, however, such, optimizations, make, the, mouse, right, or, left, hand, specific, making, more, problematic, to, change, the, tired, hand, time, has, criticized, manufacturers, for, offering, few, or, no, left, handed, ergonomic, mice, oftentimes, i, felt, like, i, was, dealing, with, someone, who, d, never, actually, met, a, left, handed, person, before, another, solution, is, a, pointing, bar, device, the, so, called, roller, bar, mouse, is, positioned, snugly, in, front, of, the, keyboard, thus, allowing, bi, manual, accessibility, these, mice, are, specifically, designed, for, use, in, computer, games, they, typically, employ, a, wider, array, of, controls, and, buttons, and, have, designs, that, differ, radically, from, traditional, mice, they, may, also, have, decorative, monochrome, or, programmable, rgb, led, lighting, the, additional, buttons, can, often, be, used, for, changing, the, sensitivity, of, the, mouse, or, they, can, be, assigned, programmed, to, macros, i, e, for, opening, a, program, or, for, use, instead, of, a, key, combination, it, is, also, common, for, game, mice, especially, those, designed, for, use, in, real, time, strategy, games, such, as, starcraft, or, in, multiplayer, online, battle, arena, games, such, as, league, of, legends, to, have, a, relatively, high, sensitivity, measured, in, dots, per, inch, dpi, which, can, be, as, high, as, 25, 600, dpi, and, cpi, are, the, same, values, that, refer, to, the, mouse, s, sensitivity, dpi, is, a, misnomer, used, in, the, gaming, world, and, many, manufacturers, use, it, to, refer, to, cpi, counts, per, inch, some, advanced, mice, from, gaming, manufacturers, also, allow, users, to, adjust, the, weight, of, the, mouse, by, adding, or, subtracting, weights, to, allow, for, easier, control, ergonomic, quality, is, also, an, important, factor, in, gaming, mouse, as, extended, gameplay, times, may, render, further, use, of, the, mouse, to, be, uncomfortable, some, mice, have, been, designed, to, have, adjustable, features, such, as, removable, and, or, elongated, palm, rests, horizontally, adjustable, thumb, rests, and, pinky, rests, some, mice, may, include, several, different, rests, with, their, products, to, ensure, comfort, for, a, wider, range, of, target, consumers, gaming, mice, are, held, by, gamers, in, three, styles, of, grip, to, transmit, their, input, typical, cabled, mice, use, a, thin, electrical, cord, terminating, in, a, standard, connector, such, as, rs, 232c, ps, 2, adb, or, usb, cordless, mice, instead, transmit, data, via, infrared, radiation, see, irda, or, radio, including, bluetooth, although, many, such, cordless, interfaces, are, themselves, connected, through, the, aforementioned, wired, serial, buses, while, the, electrical, interface, and, the, format, of, the, data, transmitted, by, commonly, available, mice, is, currently, standardized, on, usb, in, the, past, it, varied, between, different, manufacturers, a, bus, mouse, used, a, dedicated, interface, card, for, connection, to, an, ibm, pc, or, compatible, computer, mouse, use, in, dos, applications, became, more, common, after, the, introduction, of, the, microsoft, mouse, largely, because, microsoft, provided, an, open, standard, for, communication, between, applications, and, mouse, driver, software, thus, any, application, written, to, use, the, microsoft, standard, could, use, a, mouse, with, a, driver, that, implements, the, same, api, even, if, the, mouse, hardware, itself, was, incompatible, with, microsoft, s, this, driver, provides, the, state, of, the, buttons, and, the, distance, the, mouse, has, moved, in, units, that, its, documentation, calls, mickeys, in, the, 1970s, the, xerox, alto, mouse, and, in, the, 1980s, the, xerox, optical, mouse, used, a, quadrature, encoded, x, and, y, interface, this, two, bit, encoding, per, dimension, had, the, property, that, only, one, bit, of, the, two, would, change, at, a, time, like, a, gray, code, or, johnson, counter, so, that, the, transitions, would, not, be, misinterpreted, when, asynchronously, sampled, the, earliest, mass, market, mice, such, as, on, the, original, macintosh, amiga, and, atari, st, mice, used, a, d, subminiature, 9, pin, connector, to, send, the, quadrature, encoded, x, and, y, axis, signals, directly, plus, one, pin, per, mouse, button, the, mouse, was, a, simple, optomechanical, device, and, the, decoding, circuitry, was, all, in, the, main, computer, the, de, 9, connectors, were, designed, to, be, electrically, compatible, with, the, joysticks, popular, on, numerous, 8, bit, systems, such, as, the, commodore, 64, and, the, atari, 2600, although, the, ports, could, be, used, for, both, purposes, the, signals, must, be, interpreted, differently, as, a, result, plugging, a, mouse, into, a, joystick, port, causes, the, joystick, to, continuously, move, in, some, direction, even, if, the, mouse, stays, still, whereas, plugging, a, joystick, into, a, mouse, port, causes, the, mouse, to, only, be, able, to, move, a, single, pixel, in, each, direction, because, the, ibm, pc, did, not, have, a, quadrature, decoder, built, in, early, pc, mice, used, the, rs, 232c, serial, port, to, communicate, encoded, mouse, movements, as, well, as, provide, power, to, the, mouse, s, circuits, the, mouse, systems, corporation, msc, version, used, a, five, byte, protocol, and, supported, three, buttons, the, microsoft, version, used, a, three, byte, protocol, and, supported, two, buttons, due, to, the, incompatibility, between, the, two, protocols, some, manufacturers, sold, serial, mice, with, a, mode, switch, pc, for, msc, mode, ms, for, microsoft, mode, in, 1986, apple, first, implemented, the, apple, desktop, bus, allowing, the, daisy, chaining, of, up, to, 16, devices, including, mice, and, other, devices, on, the, same, bus, with, no, configuration, whatsoever, featuring, only, a, single, data, pin, the, bus, used, a, purely, polled, approach, to, device, communications, and, survived, as, the, standard, on, mainstream, models, including, a, number, of, non, apple, workstations, until, 1998, when, apple, s, imac, line, of, computers, joined, the, industry, wide, switch, to, using, usb, beginning, with, the, bronze, keyboard, powerbook, g3, in, may, 1999, apple, dropped, the, external, adb, port, in, favor, of, usb, but, retained, an, internal, adb, connection, in, the, powerbook, g4, for, communication, with, its, built, in, keyboard, and, trackpad, until, early, 2005, with, the, arrival, of, the, ibm, ps, 2, personal, computer, series, in, 1987, ibm, introduced, the, eponymous, ps, 2, port, for, mice, and, keyboards, which, other, manufacturers, rapidly, adopted, the, most, visible, change, was, the, use, of, a, round, 6, pin, mini, din, in, lieu, of, the, former, 5, pin, midi, style, full, sized, din, 41524, connector, in, default, mode, called, stream, mode, a, ps, 2, mouse, communicates, motion, and, the, state, of, each, button, by, means, of, 3, byte, packets, for, any, motion, button, press, or, button, release, event, a, ps, 2, mouse, sends, over, a, bi, directional, serial, port, a, sequence, of, three, bytes, with, the, following, format, here, xs, and, ys, represent, the, sign, bits, of, the, movement, vectors, xv, and, yv, indicate, an, overflow, in, the, respective, vector, component, and, lb, mb, and, rb, indicate, the, status, of, the, left, middle, and, right, mouse, buttons, 1, pressed, ps, 2, mice, also, understand, several, commands, for, reset, and, self, test, switching, between, different, operating, modes, and, changing, the, resolution, of, the, reported, motion, vectors, a, microsoft, intellimouse, relies, on, an, extension, of, the, ps, 2, protocol, the, imps, 2, or, imps, 2, protocol, the, abbreviation, combines, the, concepts, of, intellimouse, and, ps, 2, it, initially, operates, in, standard, ps, 2, format, for, backward, compatibility, after, the, host, sends, a, special, command, sequence, it, switches, to, an, extended, format, in, which, a, fourth, byte, carries, information, about, wheel, movements, the, intellimouse, explorer, works, analogously, with, the, difference, that, its, 4, byte, packets, also, allow, for, two, additional, buttons, for, a, total, of, five, mouse, vendors, also, use, other, extended, formats, often, without, providing, public, documentation, the, typhoon, mouse, uses, 6, byte, packets, which, can, appear, as, a, sequence, of, two, standard, 3, byte, packets, such, that, an, ordinary, ps, 2, driver, can, handle, them, for, 3d, or, 6, degree, of, freedom, input, vendors, have, made, many, extensions, both, to, the, hardware, and, to, software, in, the, late, 1990s, logitech, created, ultrasound, based, tracking, which, gave, 3d, input, to, a, few, millimeters, accuracy, which, worked, well, as, an, input, device, but, failed, as, a, profitable, product, in, 2008, motion4u, introduced, its, optiburst, system, using, ir, tracking, for, use, as, a, maya, graphics, software, plugin, almost, all, wired, mice, today, use, usb, and, the, usb, human, interface, device, class, for, communication, cordless, or, wireless, mice, transmit, data, via, radio, some, mice, connect, to, the, computer, through, bluetooth, or, wi, fi, while, others, use, a, receiver, that, plugs, into, the, computer, for, example, through, a, usb, port, many, mice, that, use, a, usb, receiver, have, a, storage, compartment, for, it, inside, the, mouse, some, nano, receivers, are, designed, to, be, small, enough, to, remain, plugged, into, a, laptop, during, transport, while, still, being, large, enough, to, easily, remove, ms, dos, and, windows, 1, 0, support, connecting, a, mouse, such, as, a, microsoft, mouse, via, multiple, interfaces, ballpoint, bus, inport, serial, port, or, ps, 2, windows, 98, added, built, in, support, for, usb, human, interface, device, class, usb, hid, with, native, vertical, scrolling, support, windows, 2000, and, windows, me, expanded, this, built, in, support, to, 5, button, mice, windows, xp, service, pack, 2, introduced, a, bluetooth, stack, allowing, bluetooth, mice, to, be, used, without, any, usb, receivers, windows, vista, added, native, support, for, horizontal, scrolling, and, standardized, wheel, movement, granularity, for, finer, scrolling, windows, 8, introduced, ble, bluetooth, low, energy, mouse, hid, support, some, systems, allow, two, or, more, mice, to, be, used, at, once, as, input, devices, late, 1980s, era, home, computers, such, as, the, amiga, used, this, to, allow, computer, games, with, two, players, interacting, on, the, same, computer, lemmings, and, the, settlers, for, example, the, same, idea, is, sometimes, used, in, collaborative, software, e, g, to, simulate, a, whiteboard, that, multiple, users, can, draw, on, without, passing, a, single, mouse, around, microsoft, windows, since, windows, 98, has, supported, multiple, simultaneous, pointing, devices, because, windows, only, provides, a, single, screen, cursor, using, more, than, one, device, at, the, same, time, requires, cooperation, of, users, or, applications, designed, for, multiple, input, devices, multiple, mice, are, often, used, in, multi, user, gaming, in, addition, to, specially, designed, devices, that, provide, several, input, interfaces, windows, also, has, full, support, for, multiple, input, mouse, configurations, for, multi, user, environments, starting, with, windows, xp, microsoft, introduced, an, sdk, for, developing, applications, that, allow, multiple, input, devices, to, be, used, at, the, same, time, with, independent, cursors, and, independent, input, points, however, it, no, longer, appears, to, be, available, the, introduction, of, windows, vista, and, microsoft, surface, now, known, as, microsoft, pixelsense, introduced, a, new, set, of, input, apis, that, were, adopted, into, windows, 7, allowing, for, 50, points, cursors, all, controlled, by, independent, users, the, new, input, points, provide, traditional, mouse, input, however, they, were, designed, with, other, input, technologies, like, touch, and, image, in, mind, they, inherently, offer, 3d, coordinates, along, with, pressure, size, tilt, angle, mask, and, even, an, image, bitmap, to, see, and, recognize, the, input, point, object, on, the, screen, as, of, 2009, linux, distributions, and, other, operating, systems, that, use, x, org, such, as, opensolaris, and, freebsd, support, 255, cursors, input, points, through, multi, pointer, x, however, currently, no, window, managers, support, multi, pointer, x, leaving, it, relegated, to, custom, software, usage, there, have, also, been, propositions, of, having, a, single, operator, use, two, mice, simultaneously, as, a, more, sophisticated, means, of, controlling, various, graphics, and, multimedia, applications, mouse, buttons, are, microswitches, which, can, be, pressed, to, select, or, interact, with, an, element, of, a, graphical, user, interface, producing, a, distinctive, clicking, sound, since, around, the, late, 1990s, the, three, button, scrollmouse, has, become, the, de, facto, standard, users, most, commonly, employ, the, second, button, to, invoke, a, contextual, menu, in, the, computer, s, software, user, interface, which, contains, options, specifically, tailored, to, the, interface, element, over, which, the, mouse, cursor, currently, sits, by, default, the, primary, mouse, button, sits, located, on, the, left, hand, side, of, the, mouse, for, the, benefit, of, right, handed, users, left, handed, users, can, usually, reverse, this, configuration, via, software, nearly, all, mice, now, have, an, integrated, input, primarily, intended, for, scrolling, on, top, usually, a, single, axis, digital, wheel, or, rocker, switch, which, can, also, be, depressed, to, act, as, a, third, button, though, less, common, many, mice, instead, have, two, axis, inputs, such, as, a, tiltable, wheel, trackball, or, touchpad, those, with, a, trackball, may, be, designed, to, stay, stationary, using, the, trackball, instead, of, moving, the, mouse, mickeys, per, second, is, a, unit, of, measurement, for, the, speed, and, movement, direction, of, a, computer, mouse, where, direction, is, often, expressed, as, horizontal, versus, vertical, mickey, count, however, speed, can, also, refer, to, the, ratio, between, how, many, pixels, the, cursor, moves, on, the, screen, and, how, far, the, mouse, moves, on, the, mouse, pad, which, may, be, expressed, as, pixels, per, mickey, pixels, per, inch, or, pixels, per, centimeter, the, computer, industry, often, measures, mouse, sensitivity, in, terms, of, counts, per, inch, cpi, commonly, expressed, as, dots, per, inch, dpi, the, number, of, steps, the, mouse, will, report, when, it, moves, one, inch, in, early, mice, this, specification, was, called, pulses, per, inch, ppi, the, mickey, originally, referred, to, one, of, these, counts, or, one, resolvable, step, of, motion, if, the, default, mouse, tracking, condition, involves, moving, the, cursor, by, one, screen, pixel, or, dot, on, screen, per, reported, step, then, the, cpi, does, equate, to, dpi, dots, of, cursor, motion, per, inch, of, mouse, motion, the, cpi, or, dpi, as, reported, by, manufacturers, depends, on, how, they, make, the, mouse, the, higher, the, cpi, the, faster, the, cursor, moves, with, mouse, movement, however, software, can, adjust, the, mouse, sensitivity, making, the, cursor, move, faster, or, slower, than, its, cpi, as, of, 2007, software, can, change, the, speed, of, the, cursor, dynamically, taking, into, account, the, mouse, s, absolute, speed, and, the, movement, from, the, last, stop, point, in, most, software, an, example, being, the, windows, platforms, this, setting, is, named, speed, referring, to, cursor, precision, however, some, operating, systems, name, this, setting, acceleration, the, typical, apple, os, designation, this, term, is, incorrect, mouse, acceleration, in, most, mouse, software, refers, to, the, change, in, speed, of, the, cursor, over, time, while, the, mouse, movement, is, constant, for, simple, software, when, the, mouse, starts, to, move, the, software, will, count, the, number, of, counts, or, mickeys, received, from, the, mouse, and, will, move, the, cursor, across, the, screen, by, that, number, of, pixels, or, multiplied, by, a, rate, factor, typically, less, than, 1, the, cursor, will, move, slowly, on, the, screen, with, good, precision, when, the, movement, of, the, mouse, passes, the, value, set, for, some, threshold, the, software, will, start, to, move, the, cursor, faster, with, a, greater, rate, factor, usually, the, user, can, set, the, value, of, the, second, rate, factor, by, changing, the, acceleration, setting, operating, systems, sometimes, apply, acceleration, referred, to, as, ballistics, to, the, motion, reported, by, the, mouse, for, example, versions, of, windows, prior, to, windows, xp, doubled, reported, values, above, a, configurable, threshold, and, then, optionally, doubled, them, again, above, a, second, configurable, threshold, these, doublings, applied, separately, in, the, x, and, y, directions, resulting, in, very, nonlinear, response, engelbart, s, original, mouse, did, not, require, a, mousepad, the, mouse, had, two, large, wheels, which, could, roll, on, virtually, any, surface, however, most, subsequent, mechanical, mice, starting, with, the, steel, roller, ball, mouse, have, required, a, mousepad, for, optimal, performance, the, mousepad, the, most, common, mouse, accessory, appears, most, commonly, in, conjunction, with, mechanical, mice, because, to, roll, smoothly, the, ball, requires, more, friction, than, common, desk, surfaces, usually, provide, so, called, hard, mousepads, for, gamers, or, optical, laser, mice, also, exist, most, optical, and, laser, mice, do, not, require, a, pad, the, notable, exception, being, early, optical, mice, which, relied, on, a, grid, on, the, pad, to, detect, movement, e, g, mouse, systems, whether, to, use, a, hard, or, soft, mousepad, with, an, optical, mouse, is, largely, a, matter, of, personal, preference, one, exception, occurs, when, the, desk, surface, creates, problems, for, the, optical, or, laser, tracking, for, example, a, transparent, or, reflective, surface, such, as, glass, some, mice, also, come, with, small, pads, attached, to, the, bottom, surface, also, called, mouse, feet, or, mouse, skates, that, help, the, user, slide, the, mouse, smoothly, across, surfaces, around, 1981, xerox, included, mice, with, its, xerox, star, based, on, the, mouse, used, in, the, 1970s, on, the, alto, computer, at, xerox, parc, sun, microsystems, symbolics, lisp, machines, inc, and, tektronix, also, shipped, workstations, with, mice, starting, in, about, 1981, later, inspired, by, the, star, apple, computer, released, the, apple, lisa, which, also, used, a, mouse, however, none, of, these, products, achieved, large, scale, success, only, with, the, release, of, the, apple, macintosh, in, 1984, did, the, mouse, see, widespread, use, the, macintosh, design, commercially, successful, and, technically, influential, led, many, other, vendors, to, begin, producing, mice, or, including, them, with, their, other, computer, products, by, 1986, atari, st, amiga, windows, 1, 0, geos, for, the, commodore, 64, and, the, apple, iigs, the, widespread, adoption, of, graphical, user, interfaces, in, the, software, of, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, made, mice, all, but, indispensable, for, controlling, computers, in, november, 2008, logitech, built, their, billionth, mouse, the, device, often, functions, as, an, interface, for, pc, based, computer, games, and, sometimes, for, video, game, consoles, the, classic, mac, os, desk, accessory, puzzle, in, 1984, was, the, first, game, designed, specifically, for, a, mouse, fpss, naturally, lend, themselves, to, separate, and, simultaneous, control, of, the, player, s, movement, and, aim, and, on, computers, this, has, traditionally, been, achieved, with, a, combination, of, keyboard, and, mouse, players, use, the, x, axis, of, the, mouse, for, looking, or, turning, left, and, right, and, the, y, axis, for, looking, up, and, down, the, keyboard, is, used, for, movement, and, supplemental, inputs, many, shooting, genre, players, prefer, a, mouse, over, a, gamepad, analog, stick, because, the, wide, range, of, motion, offered, by, a, mouse, allows, for, faster, and, more, varied, control, although, an, analog, stick, allows, the, player, more, granular, control, it, is, poor, for, certain, movements, as, the, player, s, input, is, relayed, based, on, a, vector, of, both, the, stick, s, direction, and, magnitude, thus, a, small, but, fast, movement, known, as, flick, shotting, using, a, gamepad, requires, the, player, to, quickly, move, the, stick, from, its, rest, position, to, the, edge, and, back, again, in, quick, succession, a, difficult, maneuver, in, addition, the, stick, also, has, a, finite, magnitude, if, the, player, is, currently, using, the, stick, to, move, at, a, non, zero, velocity, their, ability, to, increase, the, rate, of, movement, of, the, camera, is, further, limited, based, on, the, position, their, displaced, stick, was, already, at, before, executing, the, maneuver, the, effect, of, this, is, that, a, mouse, is, well, suited, not, only, to, small, precise, movements, but, also, to, large, quick, movements, and, immediate, responsive, movements, all, of, which, are, important, in, shooter, gaming, this, advantage, also, extends, in, varying, degrees, to, similar, game, styles, such, as, third, person, shooters, some, incorrectly, ported, games, or, game, engines, have, acceleration, and, interpolation, curves, which, unintentionally, produce, excessive, irregular, or, even, negative, acceleration, when, used, with, a, mouse, instead, of, their, native, platform, s, non, mouse, default, input, device, depending, on, how, deeply, hardcoded, this, misbehavior, is, internal, user, patches, or, external, 3rd, party, software, may, be, able, to, fix, it, individual, game, engines, will, also, have, their, own, sensitivities, this, often, restricts, one, from, taking, a, game, s, existing, sensitivity, transferring, it, to, another, and, acquiring, the, same, 360, rotational, measurements, a, sensitivity, converter, is, the, preferred, tool, that, fps, gamers, use, to, translate, correctly, the, rotational, movements, between, different, mice, and, between, different, games, calculating, the, conversion, values, manually, is, also, possible, but, it, is, more, time, consuming, and, requires, performing, complex, mathematical, calculations, while, using, a, sensitivity, converter, is, a, lot, faster, and, easier, for, gamers, due, to, their, similarity, to, the, wimp, desktop, metaphor, interface, for, which, mice, were, originally, designed, and, to, their, own, tabletop, game, origins, computer, strategy, games, are, most, commonly, played, with, mice, in, particular, real, time, strategy, and, moba, games, usually, require, the, use, of, a, mouse, the, left, button, usually, controls, primary, fire, if, the, game, supports, multiple, fire, modes, the, right, button, often, provides, secondary, fire, from, the, selected, weapon, games, with, only, a, single, fire, mode, will, generally, map, secondary, fire, to, aim, down, the, weapon, sights, in, some, games, the, right, button, may, also, invoke, accessories, for, a, particular, weapon, such, as, allowing, access, to, the, scope, of, a, sniper, rifle, or, allowing, the, mounting, of, a, bayonet, or, silencer, players, can, use, a, scroll, wheel, for, changing, weapons, or, for, controlling, scope, zoom, magnification, in, older, games, on, most, first, person, shooter, games, programming, may, also, assign, more, functions, to, additional, buttons, on, mice, with, more, than, three, controls, a, keyboard, usually, controls, movement, for, example, wasd, for, moving, forward, left, backward, and, right, respectively, and, other, functions, such, as, changing, posture, since, the, mouse, serves, for, aiming, a, mouse, that, tracks, movement, accurately, and, with, less, lag, latency, will, give, a, player, an, advantage, over, players, with, less, accurate, or, slower, mice, in, some, cases, the, right, mouse, button, may, be, used, to, move, the, player, forward, either, in, lieu, of, or, in, conjunction, with, the, typical, wasd, configuration, many, games, provide, players, with, the, option, of, mapping, their, own, choice, of, a, key, or, button, to, a, certain, control, an, early, technique, of, players, circle, strafing, saw, a, player, continuously, strafing, while, aiming, and, shooting, at, an, opponent, by, walking, in, circle, around, the, opponent, with, the, opponent, at, the, center, of, the, circle, players, could, achieve, this, by, holding, down, a, key, for, strafing, while, continuously, aiming, the, mouse, toward, the, opponent, games, using, mice, for, input, are, so, popular, that, many, manufacturers, make, mice, specifically, for, gaming, such, mice, may, feature, adjustable, weights, high, resolution, optical, or, laser, components, additional, buttons, ergonomic, shape, and, other, features, such, as, adjustable, cpi, mouse, bungees, are, typically, used, with, gaming, mice, because, it, eliminates, the, annoyance, of, the, cable, many, games, such, as, first, or, third, person, shooters, have, a, setting, named, invert, mouse, or, similar, not, to, be, confused, with, button, inversion, sometimes, performed, by, left, handed, users, which, allows, the, user, to, look, downward, by, moving, the, mouse, forward, and, upward, by, moving, the, mouse, backward, the, opposite, of, non, inverted, movement, this, control, system, resembles, that, of, aircraft, control, sticks, where, pulling, back, causes, pitch, up, and, pushing, forward, causes, pitch, down, computer, joysticks, also, typically, emulate, this, control, configuration, after, id, software, s, commercial, hit, of, doom, which, did, not, support, vertical, aiming, competitor, bungie, s, marathon, became, the, first, first, person, shooter, to, support, using, the, mouse, to, aim, up, and, down, games, using, the, build, engine, had, an, option, to, invert, the, y, axis, the, invert, feature, actually, made, the, mouse, behave, in, a, manner, that, users, now, regard, as, non, inverted, by, default, moving, mouse, forward, resulted, in, looking, down, soon, after, id, software, released, quake, which, introduced, the, invert, feature, as, users, now, know, it, in, 1988, the, vtech, socrates, educational, video, game, console, featured, a, wireless, mouse, with, an, attached, mouse, pad, as, an, optional, controller, used, for, some, games, in, the, early, 1990s, the, super, nintendo, entertainment, system, video, game, system, featured, a, mouse, in, addition, to, its, controllers, a, mouse, was, also, released, for, the, nintendo, 64, although, it, was, only, released, in, japan, the, 1992, game, mario, paint, in, particular, used, the, mouse, s, capabilities, as, did, its, japanese, only, successor, mario, artist, on, the, n64, for, its, 64dd, disk, drive, peripheral, in, 1999, sega, released, official, mice, for, their, genesis, mega, drive, saturn, and, dreamcast, consoles, nec, sold, official, mice, for, its, pc, engine, and, pc, fx, consoles, sony, released, an, official, mouse, product, for, the, playstation, console, included, one, along, with, the, linux, for, playstation, 2, kit, as, well, as, allowing, owners, to, use, virtually, any, usb, mouse, with, the, ps2, ps3, and, ps4, nintendo, s, wii, also, had, this, feature, implemented, in, a, later, software, update, and, this, support, was, retained, on, its, successor, the, wii, u, microsoft, s, xbox, line, of, game, consoles, which, used, operaring, systems, based, on, modified, versions, of, windows, nt, also, had, universal, wide, mouse, support, using, usb
