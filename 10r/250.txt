porcelain, p, r, s, l, n, is, a, ceramic, material, made, by, heating, raw, materials, generally, including, kaolinite, in, a, kiln, to, temperatures, between, 1, 200, and, 1, 400, c, 2, 200, and, 2, 600, f, the, greater, strength, and, translucence, of, porcelain, relative, to, other, types, of, pottery, arise, mainly, from, vitrification, and, the, formation, of, the, mineral, mullite, within, the, body, at, these, high, temperatures, end, applications, include, tableware, decorative, ware, such, as, figurines, and, products, in, technology, and, industry, such, as, electrical, insulators, and, laboratory, ware, the, manufacturing, process, used, for, porcelain, is, similar, to, that, used, for, earthenware, and, stoneware, the, two, other, main, types, of, pottery, although, it, can, be, more, challenging, to, produce, it, has, usually, been, regarded, as, the, most, prestigious, type, of, pottery, due, to, its, delicacy, strength, and, high, degree, of, whiteness, it, is, frequently, both, glazed, and, decorated, though, definitions, vary, porcelain, can, be, divided, into, three, main, categories, hard, paste, soft, paste, and, bone, china, the, categories, differ, in, the, composition, of, the, body, and, the, firing, conditions, porcelain, slowly, evolved, in, china, and, was, finally, achieved, depending, on, the, definition, used, at, some, point, about, 2, 000, to, 1, 200, years, ago, it, slowly, spread, to, other, east, asian, countries, then, to, europe, and, eventually, to, the, rest, of, the, world, the, european, name, porcelain, in, english, comes, from, the, old, italian, porcellana, cowrie, shell, because, of, its, resemblance, to, the, surface, of, the, shell, porcelain, is, also, referred, to, as, china, or, fine, china, in, some, english, speaking, countries, as, it, was, first, seen, in, imports, from, china, during, the, 17th, century, properties, associated, with, porcelain, include, low, permeability, and, elasticity, considerable, strength, hardness, whiteness, translucency, and, resonance, and, a, high, resistance, to, corrosive, chemicals, and, thermal, shock, porcelain, has, been, described, as, being, completely, vitrified, hard, impermeable, even, before, glazing, white, or, artificially, coloured, translucent, except, when, of, considerable, thickness, and, resonant, however, the, term, porcelain, lacks, a, universal, definition, and, has, been, applied, in, an, unsystematic, fashion, to, substances, of, diverse, kinds, that, have, only, certain, surface, qualities, in, common, traditionally, east, asia, only, classifies, pottery, into, low, fired, wares, earthenware, and, high, fired, wares, often, translated, as, porcelain, the, latter, also, including, what, europeans, call, stoneware, which, is, high, fired, but, not, generally, white, or, translucent, terms, such, as, proto, porcelain, porcellaneous, or, near, porcelain, may, be, used, in, cases, where, the, ceramic, body, approaches, whiteness, and, translucency, in, 2021, the, global, market, for, porcelain, tableware, was, estimated, to, be, worth, us, 22, 1, billion, hard, paste, porcelain, was, invented, in, china, and, it, was, also, used, in, japanese, porcelain, most, of, the, finest, quality, porcelain, wares, are, made, of, this, material, the, earliest, european, porcelains, were, produced, at, the, meissen, factory, in, the, early, 18th, century, they, were, formed, from, a, paste, composed, of, kaolin, and, alabaster, and, fired, at, temperatures, up, to, 1, 400, c, 2, 552, f, in, a, wood, fired, kiln, producing, a, porcelain, of, great, hardness, translucency, and, strength, later, the, composition, of, the, meissen, hard, paste, was, changed, and, the, alabaster, was, replaced, by, feldspar, and, quartz, allowing, the, pieces, to, be, fired, at, lower, temperatures, kaolinite, feldspar, and, quartz, or, other, forms, of, silica, continue, to, constitute, the, basic, ingredients, for, most, continental, european, hard, paste, porcelains, soft, paste, porcelains, date, back, to, early, attempts, by, european, potters, to, replicate, chinese, porcelain, by, using, mixtures, of, clay, and, frit, soapstone, and, lime, are, known, to, have, been, included, in, these, compositions, these, wares, were, not, yet, actual, porcelain, wares, as, they, were, neither, hard, nor, vitrified, by, firing, kaolin, clay, at, high, temperatures, as, these, early, formulations, suffered, from, high, pyroplastic, deformation, or, slumping, in, the, kiln, at, high, temperatures, they, were, uneconomic, to, produce, and, of, low, quality, formulations, were, later, developed, based, on, kaolin, with, quartz, feldspars, nepheline, syenite, or, other, feldspathic, rocks, these, are, technically, superior, and, continue, to, be, produced, soft, paste, porcelains, are, fired, at, lower, temperatures, than, hard, paste, porcelains, therefore, these, wares, are, generally, less, hard, than, hard, paste, porcelains, although, originally, developed, in, england, in, 1748, to, compete, with, imported, porcelain, bone, china, is, now, made, worldwide, including, in, china, the, english, had, read, the, letters, of, jesuit, missionary, fran, ois, xavier, d, entrecolles, which, described, chinese, porcelain, manufacturing, secrets, in, detail, one, writer, has, speculated, that, a, misunderstanding, of, the, text, could, possibly, have, been, responsible, for, the, first, attempts, to, use, bone, ash, as, an, ingredient, in, english, porcelain, although, this, is, not, supported, by, modern, researchers, and, historians, traditionally, english, bone, china, was, made, from, two, parts, of, bone, ash, one, part, of, kaolin, and, one, part, of, china, stone, although, the, latter, has, been, replaced, by, feldspars, from, non, uk, sources, kaolin, is, the, primary, material, from, which, porcelain, is, made, even, though, clay, minerals, might, account, for, only, a, small, proportion, of, the, whole, the, word, paste, is, an, old, term, for, both, unfired, and, fired, materials, a, more, common, terminology, for, the, unfired, material, is, body, for, example, when, buying, materials, a, potter, might, order, an, amount, of, porcelain, body, from, a, vendor, the, composition, of, porcelain, is, highly, variable, but, the, clay, mineral, kaolinite, is, often, a, raw, material, other, raw, materials, can, include, feldspar, ball, clay, glass, bone, ash, steatite, quartz, petuntse, and, alabaster, the, clays, used, are, often, described, as, being, long, or, short, depending, on, their, plasticity, long, clays, are, cohesive, sticky, and, have, high, plasticity, short, clays, are, less, cohesive, and, have, lower, plasticity, in, soil, mechanics, plasticity, is, determined, by, measuring, the, increase, in, content, of, water, required, to, change, a, clay, from, a, solid, state, bordering, on, the, plastic, to, a, plastic, state, bordering, on, the, liquid, though, the, term, is, also, used, less, formally, to, describe, the, ease, with, which, a, clay, may, be, worked, clays, used, for, porcelain, are, generally, of, lower, plasticity, than, many, other, pottery, clays, they, wet, very, quickly, meaning, that, small, changes, in, the, content, of, water, can, produce, large, changes, in, workability, thus, the, range, of, water, content, within, which, these, clays, can, be, worked, is, very, narrow, and, consequently, must, be, carefully, controlled, porcelain, can, be, made, using, all, the, shaping, techniques, for, pottery, biscuit, porcelain, is, unglazed, porcelain, treated, as, a, finished, product, mostly, for, figures, and, sculpture, unlike, their, lower, fired, counterparts, porcelain, wares, do, not, need, glazing, to, render, them, impermeable, to, liquids, and, for, the, most, part, are, glazed, for, decorative, purposes, and, to, make, them, resistant, to, dirt, and, staining, many, types, of, glaze, such, as, the, iron, containing, glaze, used, on, the, celadon, wares, of, longquan, were, designed, specifically, for, their, striking, effects, on, porcelain, porcelain, often, receives, underglaze, decoration, using, pigments, that, include, cobalt, oxide, and, copper, or, overglaze, enamels, allowing, a, wider, range, of, colours, like, many, earlier, wares, modern, porcelains, are, often, biscuit, fired, at, around, 1, 000, c, 1, 830, f, coated, with, glaze, and, then, sent, for, a, second, glaze, firing, at, a, temperature, of, about, 1, 300, c, 2, 370, f, or, greater, another, early, method, is, once, fired, where, the, glaze, is, applied, to, the, unfired, body, and, the, two, fired, together, in, a, single, operation, in, this, process, green, unfired, ceramic, wares, are, heated, to, high, temperatures, in, a, kiln, to, permanently, set, their, shapes, vitrify, the, body, and, the, glaze, porcelain, is, fired, at, a, higher, temperature, than, earthenware, so, that, the, body, can, vitrify, and, become, non, porous, many, types, of, porcelain, in, the, past, have, been, fired, twice, or, even, three, times, to, allow, decoration, using, less, robust, pigments, in, overglaze, enamel, porcelain, was, invented, in, china, over, a, centuries, long, development, period, beginning, with, proto, porcelain, wares, dating, from, the, shang, dynasty, 1600, 1046, bce, by, the, time, of, the, eastern, han, dynasty, 25, 220, ce, these, early, glazed, ceramic, wares, had, developed, into, porcelain, which, chinese, defined, as, high, fired, ware, by, the, late, sui, dynasty, 581, 618, ce, and, early, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ce, the, now, standard, requirements, of, whiteness, and, translucency, had, been, achieved, in, types, such, as, ding, ware, the, wares, were, already, exported, to, the, islamic, world, where, they, were, highly, prized, eventually, porcelain, and, the, expertise, required, to, create, it, began, to, spread, into, other, areas, of, east, asia, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, ce, artistry, and, production, had, reached, new, heights, the, manufacture, of, porcelain, became, highly, organised, and, the, dragon, kilns, excavated, from, this, period, could, fire, as, many, as, 25, 000, pieces, at, a, time, and, over, 100, 000, by, the, end, of, the, period, while, xing, ware, is, regarded, as, among, the, greatest, of, the, tang, dynasty, porcelain, ding, ware, became, the, premier, porcelain, of, the, song, dynasty, by, the, ming, dynasty, production, of, the, finest, wares, for, the, court, was, concentrated, in, a, single, city, and, jingdezhen, porcelain, originally, owned, by, the, imperial, government, remains, the, centre, of, chinese, porcelain, production, by, the, time, of, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, ce, porcelain, wares, were, being, exported, to, asia, and, europe, some, of, the, most, well, known, chinese, porcelain, art, styles, arrived, in, europe, during, this, era, such, as, the, coveted, blue, and, white, wares, the, ming, dynasty, controlled, much, of, the, porcelain, trade, which, was, expanded, to, asia, africa, and, europe, via, the, silk, road, in, 1517, portuguese, merchants, began, direct, trade, by, sea, with, the, ming, dynasty, and, in, 1598, dutch, merchants, followed, some, porcelains, were, more, highly, valued, than, others, in, imperial, china, the, most, valued, types, can, be, identified, by, their, association, with, the, court, either, as, tribute, offerings, or, as, products, of, kilns, under, imperial, supervision, since, the, yuan, dynasty, the, largest, and, best, centre, of, production, has, made, jingdezhen, porcelain, during, the, ming, dynasty, jingdezhen, porcelain, become, a, source, of, imperial, pride, the, yongle, emperor, erected, a, white, porcelain, brick, faced, pagoda, at, nanjing, and, an, exceptionally, smoothly, glazed, type, of, white, porcelain, is, peculiar, to, his, reign, jingdezhen, porcelain, s, fame, came, to, a, peak, during, the, qing, dynasty, although, the, japanese, elite, were, keen, importers, of, chinese, porcelain, from, early, on, they, were, not, able, to, make, their, own, until, the, arrival, of, korean, potters, that, were, taken, captive, during, the, japanese, invasions, of, korea, 1592, 1598, they, brought, an, improved, type, of, kiln, and, one, of, them, spotted, a, source, of, porcelain, clay, near, arita, and, before, long, several, kilns, had, started, in, the, region, at, first, their, wares, were, similar, to, the, cheaper, and, cruder, chinese, porcelains, with, underglaze, blue, decoration, that, were, already, widely, sold, in, japan, this, style, was, to, continue, for, cheaper, everyday, wares, until, the, 20th, century, exports, to, europe, began, around, 1660, through, the, chinese, and, the, dutch, east, india, company, the, only, europeans, allowed, a, trading, presence, chinese, exports, had, been, seriously, disrupted, by, civil, wars, as, the, ming, dynasty, fell, apart, and, the, japanese, exports, increased, rapidly, to, fill, the, gap, at, first, the, wares, used, european, shapes, and, mostly, chinese, decoration, as, the, chinese, had, done, but, gradually, original, japanese, styles, developed, nabeshima, ware, was, produced, in, kilns, owned, by, the, families, of, feudal, lords, and, were, decorated, in, the, japanese, tradition, much, of, it, related, to, textile, design, this, was, not, initially, exported, but, used, for, gifts, to, other, aristocratic, families, imari, ware, and, kakiemon, are, broad, terms, for, styles, of, export, porcelain, with, overglaze, enamelled, decoration, begun, in, the, early, period, both, with, many, sub, types, a, great, range, of, styles, and, manufacturing, centres, were, in, use, by, the, start, of, the, 19th, century, and, as, japan, opened, to, trade, in, the, second, half, exports, expanded, hugely, and, quality, generally, declined, much, traditional, porcelain, continues, to, replicate, older, methods, of, production, and, styles, and, there, are, several, modern, industrial, manufacturers, by, the, early, 1900s, filipino, porcelain, artisans, working, in, japanese, porcelain, centres, for, much, of, their, lives, later, on, introduced, the, craft, into, the, native, population, in, the, philippines, although, oral, literature, from, cebu, in, the, central, philippines, have, noted, that, porcelain, were, already, being, produced, by, the, natives, locally, during, the, time, of, cebu, s, early, rulers, prior, to, the, arrival, of, colonizers, in, the, 16th, century, olive, green, glaze, was, introduced, in, the, late, silla, dynasty, most, ceramics, from, silla, are, generally, leaf, shaped, which, is, a, very, common, shape, in, korea, korean, celadon, comes, in, a, variety, of, colors, from, turquoise, to, putty, additionally, thin, the, late, 13th, century, the, inlay, technique, of, expressing, pigmented, patterns, by, filling, the, hollow, parts, of, pottery, with, white, and, red, clay, was, frequently, used, the, main, difference, from, those, in, china, is, that, many, specimens, have, inlay, decoration, under, the, glaze, most, korean, ceramics, from, the, joseon, dynasty, 1392, 1910, are, of, excellent, decorative, quality, it, usually, has, a, melon, shape, and, is, asymmetrical, imported, chinese, porcelains, were, held, in, such, great, esteem, in, europe, that, in, english, china, became, a, commonly, used, synonym, for, the, italian, derived, porcelain, the, first, mention, of, porcelain, in, europe, is, in, il, milione, by, marco, polo, in, the, 13th, century, apart, from, copying, chinese, porcelain, in, faience, tin, glazed, earthenware, the, soft, paste, medici, porcelain, in, 16th, century, florence, was, the, first, real, european, attempt, to, reproduce, it, with, little, success, early, in, the, 16th, century, portuguese, traders, returned, home, with, samples, of, kaolin, which, they, discovered, in, china, to, be, essential, in, the, production, of, porcelain, wares, however, the, chinese, techniques, and, composition, used, to, manufacture, porcelain, were, not, yet, fully, understood, countless, experiments, to, produce, porcelain, had, unpredictable, results, and, met, with, failure, in, the, german, state, of, saxony, the, search, concluded, in, 1708, when, ehrenfried, walther, von, tschirnhaus, produced, a, hard, white, translucent, type, of, porcelain, specimen, with, a, combination, of, ingredients, including, kaolin, and, alabaster, mined, from, a, saxon, mine, in, colditz, it, was, a, closely, guarded, trade, secret, of, the, saxon, enterprise, in, 1712, many, of, the, elaborate, chinese, porcelain, manufacturing, secrets, were, revealed, throughout, europe, by, the, french, jesuit, father, francois, xavier, d, entrecolles, and, soon, published, in, the, lettres, difiantes, et, curieuses, de, chine, par, des, missionnaires, j, suites, the, secrets, which, d, entrecolles, read, about, and, witnessed, in, china, were, now, known, and, began, seeing, use, in, europe, von, tschirnhaus, along, with, johann, friedrich, b, ttger, were, employed, by, augustus, ii, king, of, poland, and, elector, of, saxony, who, sponsored, their, work, in, dresden, and, in, the, town, of, meissen, tschirnhaus, had, a, wide, knowledge, of, science, and, had, been, involved, in, the, european, quest, to, perfect, porcelain, manufacture, when, in, 1705, b, ttger, was, appointed, to, assist, him, in, this, task, b, ttger, had, originally, been, trained, as, a, pharmacist, after, he, turned, to, alchemical, research, he, claimed, to, have, known, the, secret, of, transmuting, dross, into, gold, which, attracted, the, attention, of, augustus, imprisoned, by, augustus, as, an, incentive, to, hasten, his, research, b, ttger, was, obliged, to, work, with, other, alchemists, in, the, futile, search, for, transmutation, and, was, eventually, assigned, to, assist, tschirnhaus, one, of, the, first, results, of, the, collaboration, between, the, two, was, the, development, of, a, red, stoneware, that, resembled, that, of, yixing, a, workshop, note, records, that, the, first, specimen, of, hard, white, and, vitrified, european, porcelain, was, produced, in, 1708, at, the, time, the, research, was, still, being, supervised, by, tschirnhaus, however, he, died, in, october, of, that, year, it, was, left, to, b, ttger, to, report, to, augustus, in, march, 1709, that, he, could, make, porcelain, for, this, reason, credit, for, the, european, discovery, of, porcelain, is, traditionally, ascribed, to, him, rather, than, tschirnhaus, the, meissen, factory, was, established, in, 1710, after, the, development, of, a, kiln, and, a, glaze, suitable, for, use, with, b, ttger, s, porcelain, which, required, firing, at, temperatures, of, up, to, 1, 400, c, 2, 552, f, to, achieve, translucence, meissen, porcelain, was, once, fired, or, green, fired, it, was, noted, for, its, great, resistance, to, thermal, shock, a, visitor, to, the, factory, in, b, ttger, s, time, reported, having, seen, a, white, hot, teapot, being, removed, from, the, kiln, and, dropped, into, cold, water, without, damage, although, widely, disbelieved, this, has, been, replicated, in, modern, times, in, 1744, elizabeth, of, russia, signed, an, agreement, to, establish, the, first, porcelain, manufactory, previously, it, had, to, be, imported, the, technology, of, making, white, gold, was, carefully, hidden, by, its, creators, peter, the, great, had, tried, to, reveal, the, big, porcelain, secret, and, sent, an, agent, to, the, meissen, factory, and, finally, hired, a, porcelain, master, from, abroad, this, relied, on, the, research, of, the, russian, scientist, dmitry, ivanovich, vinogradov, his, development, of, porcelain, manufacturing, technology, was, not, based, on, secrets, learned, through, third, parties, but, was, the, result, of, painstaking, work, and, careful, analysis, thanks, to, this, by, 1760, imperial, porcelain, factory, saint, petersburg, became, a, major, european, factories, producing, tableware, and, later, porcelain, figurines, eventually, other, factories, opened, gardner, porcelain, dulyovo, 1832, kuznetsovsky, porcelain, popovsky, porcelain, and, gzhel, during, the, twentieth, century, under, soviet, governments, ceramics, continued, to, be, a, popular, artform, supported, by, the, state, with, an, increasingly, propagandist, role, one, artist, who, worked, at, the, baranovsky, porcelain, factory, and, at, the, experimental, ceramic, and, artistic, plant, in, kyiv, was, oksana, zhnikrup, whose, porcelain, figures, of, the, ballet, and, the, circus, were, widely, known, the, pastes, produced, by, combining, clay, and, powdered, glass, frit, were, called, frittenporzellan, in, germany, and, frita, in, spain, in, france, they, were, known, as, p, te, tendre, and, in, england, as, soft, paste, they, appear, to, have, been, given, this, name, because, they, do, not, easily, retain, their, shape, in, the, wet, state, or, because, they, tend, to, slump, in, the, kiln, under, high, temperature, or, because, the, body, and, the, glaze, can, be, easily, scratched, experiments, at, rouen, produced, the, earliest, soft, paste, in, france, but, the, first, important, french, soft, paste, porcelain, was, made, at, the, saint, cloud, factory, before, 1702, soft, paste, factories, were, established, with, the, chantilly, manufactory, in, 1730, and, at, mennecy, in, 1750, the, vincennes, porcelain, factory, was, established, in, 1740, moving, to, larger, premises, at, s, vres, in, 1756, vincennes, soft, paste, was, whiter, and, freer, of, imperfections, than, any, of, its, french, rivals, which, put, vincennes, s, vres, porcelain, in, the, leading, position, in, france, and, throughout, the, whole, of, europe, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, doccia, porcelain, of, florence, was, founded, in, 1735, and, remains, in, production, unlike, capodimonte, porcelain, which, was, moved, from, naples, to, madrid, by, its, royal, owner, after, producing, from, 1743, to, 1759, after, a, gap, of, 15, years, naples, porcelain, was, produced, from, 1771, to, 1806, specializing, in, neoclassical, styles, all, these, were, very, successful, with, large, outputs, of, high, quality, wares, in, and, around, venice, francesco, vezzi, was, producing, hard, paste, from, around, 1720, to, 1735, survivals, of, vezzi, porcelain, are, very, rare, but, less, so, than, from, the, hewelke, factory, which, only, lasted, from, 1758, to, 1763, the, soft, paste, cozzi, factory, fared, better, lasting, from, 1764, to, 1812, the, le, nove, factory, produced, from, about, 1752, to, 1773, then, was, revived, from, 1781, to, 1802, the, first, soft, paste, in, england, was, demonstrated, by, thomas, briand, to, the, royal, society, in, 1742, and, is, believed, to, have, been, based, on, the, saint, cloud, formula, in, 1749, thomas, frye, took, out, a, patent, on, a, porcelain, containing, bone, ash, this, was, the, first, bone, china, subsequently, perfected, by, josiah, spode, william, cookworthy, discovered, deposits, of, kaolin, in, cornwall, and, his, factory, at, plymouth, established, in, 1768, used, kaolin, and, china, stone, to, make, hard, paste, porcelain, with, a, body, composition, similar, to, that, of, the, chinese, porcelains, of, the, early, 18th, century, but, the, great, success, of, english, ceramics, in, the, 18th, century, was, based, on, soft, paste, porcelain, and, refined, earthenwares, such, as, creamware, which, could, compete, with, porcelain, and, had, devastated, the, faience, industries, of, france, and, other, continental, countries, by, the, end, of, the, century, most, english, porcelain, from, the, late, 18th, century, to, the, present, is, bone, china, in, the, twenty, five, years, after, briand, s, demonstration, a, number, of, factories, were, founded, in, england, to, make, soft, paste, tableware, and, figures, porcelain, has, been, used, for, electrical, insulators, since, at, least, 1878, with, another, source, reporting, earlier, use, of, porcelain, insulators, on, the, telegraph, line, between, frankfurt, and, berlin, it, is, widely, used, for, insulators, in, electrical, power, transmission, system, due, to, its, high, stability, of, electrical, mechanical, and, thermal, properties, even, in, harsh, environments, a, body, for, electrical, porcelain, typically, contains, varying, proportions, of, ball, clay, kaolin, feldspar, quartz, calcined, alumina, and, calcined, bauxite, a, variety, of, secondary, materials, can, also, be, used, such, as, binders, which, burn, off, during, firing, uk, manufacturers, typically, fired, the, porcelain, to, a, maximum, of, 1200, c, in, an, oxidising, atmosphere, whereas, reduction, firing, is, standard, practice, at, chinese, manufacturers, in, 2018, a, porcelain, bushing, insulator, manufactured, by, ngk, in, handa, aichi, prefecture, japan, was, certified, as, the, world, s, largest, ceramic, structure, by, guinness, world, records, it, is, 11, 3, m, in, height, and, 1, 5, m, in, diameter, the, global, market, for, high, voltage, insulators, was, estimated, to, be, worth,
