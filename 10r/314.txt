wider, and, taller, door, for, vehicles, called, the, garage, door, which, can, be, opened, to, permit, the, entry, and, exit, of, a, vehicle, and, then, closed, to, secure, the, vehicle, a, garage, protects, a, vehicle, from, precipitation, and, if, it, is, equipped, with, a, locking, garage, door, it, also, protects, the, vehicle, s, from, theft, and, vandalism, most, garages, also, serve, multifunction, duty, as, workshops, for, a, variety, of, projects, including, painting, woodworking, and, assembly, garages, also, may, be, used, for, other, purposes, as, well, such, as, storage, or, entertainment, some, garages, have, an, electrical, mechanism, to, automatically, open, or, close, the, garage, door, when, the, homeowner, presses, a, button, on, a, small, remote, control, along, with, a, detector, that, stops, the, movement, of, the, garage, if, something, is, in, the, way, of, closing, some, garages, have, enough, space, even, with, cars, inside, for, the, storage, of, items, such, as, bicycles, or, a, lawnmower, in, some, cases, there, may, even, be, enough, space, for, a, workshop, or, a, man, cave, garages, that, are, attached, to, a, house, may, be, built, with, the, same, external, materials, and, roofing, as, the, house, garages, that, are, not, connected, to, the, home, may, use, a, different, style, of, construction, from, the, house, often, in, the, southern, and, rural, united, states, garages, not, attached, to, the, home, and, made, from, a, timber, frame, with, sheet, metal, coverings, are, known, as, pole, barns, but, usually, serve, the, same, purpose, as, what, is, called, a, garage, elsewhere, in, some, places, the, term, is, used, synonymously, with, carport, though, that, term, normally, describes, a, structure, that, while, roofed, is, not, completely, enclosed, a, carport, protects, the, vehicle, to, some, degree, from, inclement, weather, but, it, does, not, protect, the, vehicle, from, theft, or, vandalism, the, word, garage, introduced, to, english, in, 1902, originates, from, the, french, word, garer, meaning, shelter, by, 1908, the, architect, charles, harrison, townsend, was, commenting, in, the, builder, magazine, that, for, the, home, of, the, car, we, very, largely, use, the, french, word, garage, alternatively, with, what, i, think, the, more, desirable, english, equivalent, of, motor, house, today, the, word, is, polysemic, because, it, can, refer, to, a, collection, of, vehicles, as, well, as, the, building, that, contains, them, in, northern, climates, temperatures, inside, an, uninsulated, attached, residential, garage, can, decrease, to, freezing, levels, during, the, winter, temperatures, inside, an, uninsulated, attached, garage, in, temperate, climates, can, reach, uncomfortable, levels, during, summer, months, extreme, temperatures, can, be, a, source, of, energy, waste, and, discomfort, in, adjoining, living, areas, due, to, heat, transfer, between, the, garage, and, those, areas, homes, with, an, attached, garage, often, experience, this, interface, problem, insulating, the, outside, of, the, building, against, the, elements, without, extending, the, insulation, to, the, wall, separating, the, garage, from, the, house, and, or, the, other, garage, walls, and, roof, can, be, a, costly, mistake, australian, homes, typically, have, a, two, one, and, a, half, or, double, car, garage, with, some, newer, houses, having, a, triple, garage, with, one, double, door, and, one, single, door, prior, to, the, 1970s, most, of, them, were, detached, from, the, house, usually, set, further, back, with, the, driveway, leading, up, past, the, side, of, the, house, common, with, old, fibreboard, houses, but, not, uncommon, with, earlier, brick, houses, the, most, common, doors, on, these, garages, were, either, two, wooden, barn, style, doors, with, a, standard, sized, access, door, on, the, side, of, the, garage, or, the, b, d, rolla, door, which, is, described, below, the, most, common, garage, door, to, date, in, australia, is, the, b, d, rolla, door, having, been, around, since, 1956, and, still, in, heavy, use, today, they, are, a, corrugated, flexible, but, strong, sheet, steel, door, sliding, up, tracks, and, rolling, around, a, drum, mounted, above, the, door, opening, on, the, inside, of, the, garage, these, come, in, manual, and, remote, controlled, electric, known, as, the, control, a, door, with, conversion, kits, available, locking, is, provided, by, a, key, lock, in, the, centre, of, the, door, moving, two, square, sliding, lock, bars, in, and, out, of, holes, in, the, door, tracks, locking, and, unlocking, it, or, by, the, solenoid, lock, in, the, automatic, motor, newer, homes, feature, more, american, styled, tilting, panel, lift, doors, which, slide, up, onto, a, track, on, the, ceiling, via, a, motor, and, chain, drive, since, the, late, 1970s, most, if, not, all, garages, are, attached, and, throughout, the, 80, s, it, became, more, common, to, have, an, access, door, into, the, home, from, the, garage, where, design, permitted, whereas, it, is, commonplace, now, most, older, unit, apartment, blocks, in, australia, have, garages, on, the, ground, floor, accessible, through, a, common, hallway, and, access, doors, all, leading, into, a, common, driveway, newer, ones, now, have, underground, parking, australia, has, strict, guidelines, in, place, when, building, a, home, and, the, garage, size, must, conform, to, the, australian, standards, the, minimum, size, for, a, single, garage, is, 3, 0, m, 5, 4, m, 9, 8, ft, 17, 7, ft, and, a, double, is, 5, 4, m, 5, 4, m, 17, 7, ft, 17, 7, ft, however, to, comfortably, fit, two, cars, in, a, double, garage, it, is, typical, to, have, a, size, of, 6, 0, m, 6, 0, m, 19, 7, ft, 19, 7, ft, british, homes, featuring, a, garage, typically, have, a, single, or, double, garage, either, built, into, the, main, building, detached, within, the, grounds, often, in, the, back, garden, or, in, a, communal, area, traditionally, garage, doors, were, wooden, opening, either, as, two, leaves, or, sliding, horizontally, newer, garages, are, fitted, with, metal, up, and, over, doors, increasingly, in, new, homes, such, doors, are, electrically, operated, typically, a, small, british, single, garage, is, 8, by, 16, feet, 2, 4, m, 4, 9, m, a, medium, single, garage, is, 9, by, 18, feet, 2, 7, m, 5, 5, m, and, a, large, single, garage, is, 10, by, 20, feet, 3, 0, m, 6, 1, m, family, sedans, have, become, bigger, than, they, were, in, the, past, so, the, larger, size, has, become, a, preferred, option, a, typical, large, family, car, like, the, ford, mondeo, is, about, 15, by, 6, feet, 4, 6, m, 1, 8, m, meaning, that, even, with, the, larger, size, garage, it, is, necessary, to, park, to, one, side, to, be, able, to, open, the, driver, s, door, wide, enough, to, enter, or, exit, the, vehicle, in, the, early, days, of, the, motor, car, a, garage, played, an, important, role, in, protecting, the, vehicle, from, the, weather, particularly, so, as, to, reduce, rust, it, was, also, the, case, that, early, motor, cars, started, more, easily, when, they, were, warm, so, that, keeping, them, in, a, garage, rather, than, outside, made, it, easier, to, get, the, engine, going, in, the, morning, modern, motor, cars, however, are, very, well, protected, against, rust, and, modern, engines, start, with, no, difficulty, even, in, very, cold, conditions, the, common, term, for, these, structures, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, was, motor, house, many, garages, from, before, 1914, were, pre, fabricated, typically, by, companies, such, as, norwich, manufacturer, boulton, paul, ltd, the, style, was, usually, in, keeping, with, that, of, the, house, and, its, locale, however, they, were, mainly, of, timber, construction, and, few, have, survived, e, keynes, purchase, honorary, architect, to, what, was, to, become, the, royal, automobile, club, did, a, lot, of, work, on, them, and, recommended, in, the, car, illustrated, in, 1902, that, they, be, of, brick, construction, with, cement, floor, an, inspection, pit, good, electric, lighting, and, a, pulley, system, for, removing, parts, of, the, car, in, the, early, days, of, motoring, many, car, owners, were, mechanical, and, engineering, enthusiasts, the, architecture, of, garages, was, ignored, in, the, architectural, journals, despite, famous, architects, such, as, edwin, lutyens, richard, barry, parker, and, edgar, wood, all, designing, garages, for, their, wealthy, clients, charles, harrison, townsend, was, one, of, the, few, architects, who, put, pen, to, paper, in, the, builder, in, 1908, on, the, subject, and, recommended, that, the, walls, be, glazed, brick, for, ease, of, washing, air, gratings, to, be, low, petrol, fumes, are, heavier, than, air, and, drains, half, open, to, avoid, build, up, of, gases, by, 1910, corrugated, iron, and, asbestos, were, being, used, instead, of, wood, and, garages, became, less, imposing, from, 1912, speculatively, built, houses, in, london, were, being, built, with, motor, houses, many, garage, doors, open, upward, using, an, electric, chain, drive, which, can, often, be, automatically, controlled, from, inside, the, resident, s, vehicle, with, a, small, radio, transmitter, garages, are, connected, to, the, nearest, road, with, a, driveway, interior, space, for, one, or, two, cars, is, normal, and, garages, built, after, 1950, usually, have, a, door, that, connects, the, garage, directly, to, the, interior, of, the, house, an, attached, garage, earlier, garages, were, often, detached, and, located, in, the, back, yard, of, the, house, accessed, either, via, a, long, driveway, or, from, an, alley, in, the, past, garages, were, often, separate, buildings, from, the, house, detached, garage, on, occasion, a, garage, would, be, built, with, an, apartment, above, it, which, could, be, rented, out, as, automobiles, became, more, popular, the, concept, of, attaching, the, garage, directly, to, the, home, grew, into, a, common, practice, while, a, person, with, a, separate, garage, must, walk, outdoors, in, every, type, of, weather, a, person, with, an, attached, garage, has, a, much, shorter, walk, inside, a, building, around, the, start, of, the, 21st, century, companies, began, offering, portable, garages, in, the, united, states, typically, these, garages, are, made, of, metal, wood, or, vinyl, and, do, not, connect, to, the, house, or, other, structure, much, like, the, garage, built, before, 1950, this, portable, garages, usually, have, a, strongly, reinforced, floor, to, hold, a, heavy, vehicle, garages, are, also, produced, as, composite, fabric, garages, with, metal, frames, that, are, lightweight, and, portable, garage, compared, to, traditional, brick, and, mortar, or, metal, garage, structures, over, the, past, fifteen, years, the, portable, garage, has, further, evolved, into, a, modular, garage, or, a, partially, prefabricated, structure, the, modular, garage, comes, from, a, factory, that, assembles, the, garage, in, two, sections, and, combines, the, two, sections, on, location, partially, prefabricated, garages, are, often, larger, and, might, even, include, an, attic, space, or, a, second, floor, sections, of, the, garage, are, preassembled, and, then, setup, on, site, over, a, few, days, time, the, amish, have, become, popular, builders, of, portable, modular, and, partially, prefabricated, garages, often, in, more, rural, settings, detached, post, frame, garages, are, used, to, store, farm, and, workshop, equipment, and, can, either, be, cold, storage, or, insulated, for, warm, storage, the, first, planned, private, garages, appeared, long, before, 1900, early, examples, of, planned, public, garages, appeared, at, the, same, time, the, first, recorded, public, parking, garage, in, the, us, electric, vehicle, company, garage, chicago, was, built, in, 1898, in, the, uk, christal, palace, garage, london, in, 1900, and, in, germany, gro, garage, der, autom, ller, g, m, b, h, berlin, wilmersdorf, in, 1901, possibly, the, oldest, existing, garage, in, the, united, kingdom, is, in, southport, lancashire, it, was, the, first, motor, house, or, garage, to, be, depicted, in, an, english, motoring, journal, and, was, in, the, autocar, of, 7, october, 1899, it, was, owned, by, dr, w, w, barratt, a, local, doctor, and, motoring, pioneer, and, specially, designed, for, his, house, at, 29, park, crescent, hesketh, park, a, two, storey, building, that, matched, the, style, of, the, house, the, ground, floor, garage, having, a, concrete, floor, heating, electric, lighting, an, engine, pit, and, was, fully, equipped, the, motor, house, is, now, in, residential, use, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, private, garages, in, germany, today, is, the, 1903, finished, automobil, remise, automobile, carriage, house, of, villa, esche, by, henry, van, de, velde, in, chemnitz, carl, benz, the, inventor, of, the, automobile, had, a, tower, built, for, himself, in, 1910, on, the, first, floor, a, room, for, studying, on, the, ground, floor, car, parking, space, it, still, exists, in, ladenburg, germany, garages, in, the, united, states, and, canada, used, to, store, streetcars, and, buses, are, often, referred, to, as, carhouses, or, car, barns, these, storage, facilities, are, either, metal, or, brick, structures, used, to, store, streetcars, or, buses, away, from, the, elements, in, britain, they, are, referred, to, as, bus, depots, or, depots
