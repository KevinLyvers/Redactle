an, optical, telescope, is, a, telescope, that, gathers, and, focuses, light, mainly, from, the, visible, part, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, to, create, a, magnified, image, for, direct, visual, inspection, to, make, a, photograph, or, to, collect, data, through, electronic, image, sensors, there, are, three, primary, types, of, optical, telescope, an, optical, telescope, s, ability, to, resolve, small, details, is, directly, related, to, the, diameter, or, aperture, of, its, objective, the, primary, lens, or, mirror, that, collects, and, focuses, the, light, and, its, light, gathering, power, is, related, to, the, area, of, the, objective, the, larger, the, objective, the, more, light, the, telescope, collects, and, the, finer, detail, it, resolves, people, use, optical, telescopes, including, monoculars, and, binoculars, for, outdoor, activities, such, as, observational, astronomy, ornithology, pilotage, hunting, and, reconnaissance, as, well, as, indoor, semi, outdoor, activities, such, as, watching, performance, arts, and, spectator, sports, the, telescope, is, more, a, discovery, of, optical, craftsmen, than, an, invention, of, a, scientist, the, lens, and, the, properties, of, refracting, and, reflecting, light, had, been, known, since, antiquity, and, theory, on, how, they, worked, was, developed, by, ancient, greek, philosophers, preserved, and, expanded, on, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, and, had, reached, a, significantly, advanced, state, by, the, time, of, the, telescope, s, invention, in, early, modern, europe, but, the, most, significant, step, cited, in, the, invention, of, the, telescope, was, the, development, of, lens, manufacture, for, spectacles, first, in, venice, and, florence, in, the, thirteenth, century, and, later, in, the, spectacle, making, centers, in, both, the, netherlands, and, germany, it, is, in, the, netherlands, in, 1608, where, the, first, documents, describing, a, refracting, optical, telescope, surfaced, in, the, form, of, a, patent, filed, by, spectacle, maker, hans, lippershey, followed, a, few, weeks, later, by, claims, by, jacob, metius, and, a, third, unknown, applicant, that, they, also, knew, of, this, art, word, of, the, invention, spread, fast, and, galileo, galilei, on, hearing, of, the, device, was, making, his, own, improved, designs, within, a, year, and, was, the, first, to, publish, astronomical, results, using, a, telescope, galileo, s, telescope, used, a, convex, objective, lens, and, a, concave, eye, lens, a, design, is, now, called, a, galilean, telescope, johannes, kepler, proposed, an, improvement, on, the, design, that, used, a, convex, eyepiece, often, called, the, keplerian, telescope, the, next, big, step, in, the, development, of, refractors, was, the, advent, of, the, achromatic, lens, in, the, early, 18th, century, which, corrected, the, chromatic, aberration, in, keplerian, telescopes, up, to, that, time, allowing, for, much, shorter, instruments, with, much, larger, objectives, for, reflecting, telescopes, which, use, a, curved, mirror, in, place, of, the, objective, lens, theory, preceded, practice, the, theoretical, basis, for, curved, mirrors, behaving, similar, to, lenses, was, probably, established, by, alhazen, whose, theories, had, been, widely, disseminated, in, latin, translations, of, his, work, soon, after, the, invention, of, the, refracting, telescope, galileo, giovanni, francesco, sagredo, and, others, spurred, on, by, their, knowledge, that, curved, mirrors, had, similar, properties, to, lenses, discussed, the, idea, of, building, a, telescope, using, a, mirror, as, the, image, forming, objective, the, potential, advantages, of, using, parabolic, mirrors, primarily, a, reduction, of, spherical, aberration, with, elimination, of, chromatic, aberration, led, to, several, proposed, designs, for, reflecting, telescopes, the, most, notable, of, which, was, published, in, 1663, by, james, gregory, and, came, to, be, called, the, gregorian, telescope, but, no, working, models, were, built, isaac, newton, has, been, generally, credited, with, constructing, the, first, practical, reflecting, telescopes, the, newtonian, telescope, in, 1668, although, due, to, their, difficulty, of, construction, and, the, poor, performance, of, the, speculum, metal, mirrors, used, it, took, over, 100, years, for, reflectors, to, become, popular, many, of, the, advances, in, reflecting, telescopes, included, the, perfection, of, parabolic, mirror, fabrication, in, the, 18th, century, silver, coated, glass, mirrors, in, the, 19th, century, long, lasting, aluminum, coatings, in, the, 20th, century, segmented, mirrors, to, allow, larger, diameters, and, active, optics, to, compensate, for, gravitational, deformation, a, mid, 20th, century, innovation, was, catadioptric, telescopes, such, as, the, schmidt, camera, which, uses, both, a, lens, corrector, plate, and, mirror, as, primary, optical, elements, mainly, used, for, wide, field, imaging, without, spherical, aberration, the, late, 20th, century, has, seen, the, development, of, adaptive, optics, and, space, telescopes, to, overcome, the, problems, of, astronomical, seeing, the, electronics, revolution, of, the, early, 21st, century, led, to, the, development, of, computer, connected, telescopes, in, the, 2010s, that, allow, non, professional, skywatchers, to, observe, stars, and, satellites, using, relatively, low, cost, equipment, by, taking, advantage, of, digital, astrophotographic, techniques, developed, by, professional, astronomers, over, previous, decades, an, electronic, connection, to, a, computer, smartphone, pad, or, laptop, is, required, to, make, astronomical, observations, from, the, telescopes, the, digital, technology, allows, multiple, images, to, be, stacked, while, subtracting, the, noise, component, of, the, observation, producing, images, of, messier, objects, and, faint, stars, as, dim, as, an, apparent, magnitude, of, 15, with, consumer, grade, equipment, the, basic, scheme, is, that, the, primary, light, gathering, element, the, objective, 1, the, convex, lens, or, concave, mirror, used, to, gather, the, incoming, light, focuses, that, light, from, the, distant, object, 4, to, a, focal, plane, where, it, forms, a, real, image, 5, this, image, may, be, recorded, or, viewed, through, an, eyepiece, 2, which, acts, like, a, magnifying, glass, the, eye, 3, then, sees, an, inverted, magnified, virtual, image, 6, of, the, object, most, telescope, designs, produce, an, inverted, image, at, the, focal, plane, these, are, referred, to, as, inverting, telescopes, in, fact, the, image, is, both, turned, upside, down, and, reversed, left, to, right, so, that, altogether, it, is, rotated, by, 180, degrees, from, the, object, orientation, in, astronomical, telescopes, the, rotated, view, is, normally, not, corrected, since, it, does, not, affect, how, the, telescope, is, used, however, a, mirror, diagonal, is, often, used, to, place, the, eyepiece, in, a, more, convenient, viewing, location, and, in, that, case, the, image, is, erect, but, still, reversed, left, to, right, in, terrestrial, telescopes, such, as, spotting, scopes, monoculars, and, binoculars, prisms, e, g, porro, prisms, or, a, relay, lens, between, objective, and, eyepiece, are, used, to, correct, the, image, orientation, there, are, telescope, designs, that, do, not, present, an, inverted, image, such, as, the, galilean, refractor, and, the, gregorian, reflector, these, are, referred, to, as, erecting, telescopes, many, types, of, telescope, fold, or, divert, the, optical, path, with, secondary, or, tertiary, mirrors, these, may, be, integral, part, of, the, optical, design, newtonian, telescope, cassegrain, reflector, or, similar, types, or, may, simply, be, used, to, place, the, eyepiece, or, detector, at, a, more, convenient, position, telescope, designs, may, also, use, specially, designed, additional, lenses, or, mirrors, to, improve, image, quality, over, a, larger, field, of, view, design, specifications, relate, to, the, characteristics, of, the, telescope, and, how, it, performs, optically, several, properties, of, the, specifications, may, change, with, the, equipment, or, accessories, used, with, the, telescope, such, as, barlow, lenses, star, diagonals, and, eyepieces, these, interchangeable, accessories, do, not, alter, the, specifications, of, the, telescope, however, they, alter, the, way, the, telescope, s, properties, function, typically, magnification, apparent, field, of, view, fov, and, actual, field, of, view, the, smallest, resolvable, surface, area, of, an, object, as, seen, through, an, optical, telescope, is, the, limited, physical, area, that, can, be, resolved, it, is, analogous, to, angular, resolution, but, differs, in, definition, instead, of, separation, ability, between, point, light, sources, it, refers, to, the, physical, area, that, can, be, resolved, a, familiar, way, to, express, the, characteristic, is, the, resolvable, ability, of, features, such, as, moon, craters, or, sun, spots, expression, using, the, formula, is, given, by, twice, the, resolving, power, r, displaystyle, r, over, aperture, diameter, d, displaystyle, d, multiplied, by, the,

displaystyle, r, is, derived, from, the, wavelength, displaystyle, lambda, using, the, same, unit, as, aperture, where, 550, nm, to, mm, is, given, by, r, 10, 6, 550, 10, 6, 0, 00055, displaystyle, r, frac, lambda, 10, 6, frac, 550, 10, 6, 0, 00055, the, constant, displaystyle, phi, is, derived, from, radians, to, the, same, unit, as, the, object, s, apparent, diameter, where, the, moon, s, apparent, diameter, of, d, a, 313, 10800, displaystyle, d, a, frac, 313, pi, 10800, radians, to, arcsecs, is, given, by, d, a, 313, 10800, 206265, 1878, displaystyle, d, a, frac, 313, pi, 10800, cdot, 206265, 1878, an, example, using, a, telescope, with, an, aperture, of, 130, mm, observing, the, moon, in, a, 550, nm, wavelength, is, given, by, f, 2, r, d, d, o, b, d, a, 2, 0, 00055, 130, 3474, 2,

object, diameter, results, in, the, smallest, resolvable, features, at, that, unit, in, the, above, example, they, are, approximated, in, kilometers, resulting, in, the, smallest, resolvable, moon, craters, being, 3, 22, km, in, diameter, the, hubble, space, telescope, has, a, primary, mirror, aperture, of, 2400, mm, that, provides, a, surface, resolvability, of, moon, craters, being, 174, 9, meters, in, diameter, or, sunspots, of, 7365, 2, km, in, diameter, ignoring, blurring, of, the, image, by, turbulence, in, the, atmosphere, atmospheric, seeing, and, optical, imperfections, of, the, telescope, the, angular, resolution, of, an, optical, telescope, is, determined, by, the, diameter, of, the, primary, mirror, or, lens, gathering, the, light, also, termed, its, aperture, the, rayleigh, criterion, for, the, resolution, limit, r, displaystyle, alpha, r, in, radians, is, given, by, where, displaystyle, lambda, is, the, wavelength, and, d, displaystyle, d, is, the, aperture, for, visible, light, displaystyle, lambda, 550, nm, in, the, small, angle, approximation, this, equation, can, be, rewritten, here, r, displaystyle, alpha, r, denotes, the, resolution, limit, in, arcseconds, and, d, displaystyle, d, is, in, millimeters, in, the, ideal, case, the, two, components, of, a, double, star, system, can, be, discerned, even, if, separated, by, slightly, less, than, r, displaystyle, alpha, r, this, is, taken, into, account, by, the, dawes, limit, the, equation, shows, that, all, else, being, equal, the, larger, the, aperture, the, better, the, angular, resolution, the, resolution, is, not, given, by, the, maximum, magnification, or, power, of, a, telescope, telescopes, marketed, by, giving, high, values, of, the, maximum, power, often, deliver, poor, images, for, large, ground, based, telescopes, the, resolution, is, limited, by, atmospheric, seeing, this, limit, can, be, overcome, by, placing, the, telescopes, above, the, atmosphere, e, g, on, the, summits, of, high, mountains, on, balloons, and, high, flying, airplanes, or, in, space, resolution, limits, can, also, be, overcome, by, adaptive, optics, speckle, imaging, or, lucky, imaging, for, ground, based, telescopes, recently, it, has, become, practical, to, perform, aperture, synthesis, with, arrays, of, optical, telescopes, very, high, resolution, images, can, be, obtained, with, groups, of, widely, spaced, smaller, telescopes, linked, together, by, carefully, controlled, optical, paths, but, these, interferometers, can, only, be, used, for, imaging, bright, objects, such, as, stars, or, measuring, the, bright, cores, of, active, galaxies, the, focal, length, of, an, optical, system, is, a, measure, of, how, strongly, the, system, converges, or, diverges, light, for, an, optical, system, in, air, it, is, the, distance, over, which, initially, collimated, rays, are, brought, to, a, focus, a, system, with, a, shorter, focal, length, has, greater, optical, power, than, one, with, a, long, focal, length, that, is, it, bends, the, rays, more, strongly, bringing, them, to, a, focus, in, a, shorter, distance, in, astronomy, the, f, number, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, focal, ratio, notated, as, n, displaystyle, n, the, focal, ratio, of, a, telescope, is, defined, as, the, focal, length, f, displaystyle, f, of, an, objective, divided, by, its, diameter, d, displaystyle, d, or, by, the, diameter, of, an, aperture, stop, in, the, system, the, focal, length, controls, the, field, of, view, of, the, instrument, and, the, scale, of, the, image, that, is, presented, at, the, focal, plane, to, an, eyepiece, film, plate, or, ccd, an, example, of, a, telescope, with, a, focal, length, of, 1200, mm, and, aperture, diameter, of, 254, mm, is, given, by, n, f, d, 1200, 254, 4, 7, displaystyle, n, frac, f, d, frac, 1200, 254, approx, 4, 7, numerically, large, focal, ratios, are, said, to, be, long, or, slow, small, numbers, are, short, or, fast, there, are, no, sharp, lines, for, determining, when, to, use, these, terms, and, an, individual, may, consider, their, own, standards, of, determination, among, contemporary, astronomical, telescopes, any, telescope, with, a, focal, ratio, slower, bigger, number, than, f, 12, is, generally, considered, slow, and, any, telescope, with, a, focal, ratio, faster, smaller, number, than, f, 6, is, considered, fast, faster, systems, often, have, more, optical, aberrations, away, from, the, center, of, the, field, of, view, and, are, generally, more, demanding, of, eyepiece, designs, than, slower, ones, a, fast, system, is, often, desired, for, practical, purposes, in, astrophotography, with, the, purpose, of, gathering, more, photons, in, a, given, time, period, than, a, slower, system, allowing, time, lapsed, photography, to, process, the, result, faster, wide, field, telescopes, such, as, astrographs, are, used, to, track, satellites, and, asteroids, for, cosmic, ray, research, and, for, astronomical, surveys, of, the, sky, it, is, more, difficult, to, reduce, optical, aberrations, in, telescopes, with, low, f, ratio, than, in, telescopes, with, larger, f, ratio, the, light, gathering, power, of, an, optical, telescope, also, referred, to, as, light, grasp, or, aperture, gain, is, the, ability, of, a, telescope, to, collect, a, lot, more, light, than, the, human, eye, its, light, gathering, power, is, probably, its, most, important, feature, the, telescope, acts, as, a, light, bucket, collecting, all, of, the, photons, that, come, down, on, it, from, a, far, away, object, where, a, larger, bucket, catches, more, photons, resulting, in, more, received, light, in, a, given, time, period, effectively, brightening, the, image, this, is, why, the, pupils, of, your, eyes, enlarge, at, night, so, that, more, light, reaches, the, retinas, the, gathering, power, p, displaystyle, p, compared, against, a, human, eye, is, the, squared, result, of, the, division, of, the, aperture, d, displaystyle, d, over, the, observer, s, pupil, diameter, d, p, displaystyle, d, p, with, an, average, adult, having, a, pupil, diameter, of, 7, mm, younger, persons, host, larger, diameters, typically, said, to, be, 9, mm, as, the, diameter, of, the, pupil, decreases, with, age, an, example, gathering, power, of, an, aperture, with, 254, mm, compared, to, an, adult, pupil, diameter, being, 7, mm, is, given, by, p, d, d, p, 2, 254, 7, 2, 1316, 7, displaystyle, p, left, frac, d, d, p, right, 2, left, frac, 254, 7, right, 2, approx, 1316, 7, light, gathering, power, can, be, compared, between, telescopes, by, comparing, the, areas, a, displaystyle, a, of, the, two, different, apertures, as, an, example, the, light, gathering, power, of, a, 10, meter, telescope, is, 25x, that, of, a, 2, meter, telescope, p, a, 1, a, 2, 5, 2, 1, 2, 25, displaystyle, p, frac, a, 1, a, 2, frac, pi, 5, 2, pi, 1, 2, 25, for, a, survey, of, a, given, area, the, field, of, view, is, just, as, important, as, raw, light, gathering, power, survey, telescopes, such, as, the, large, synoptic, survey, telescope, try, to, maximize, the, product, of, mirror, area, and, field, of, view, or, etendue, rather, than, raw, light, gathering, ability, alone, the, magnification, through, a, telescope, makes, an, object, appear, larger, while, limiting, the, fov, magnification, is, often, misleading, as, the, optical, power, of, the, telescope, its, characteristic, is, the, most, misunderstood, term, used, to, describe, the, observable, world, at, higher, magnifications, the, image, quality, significantly, reduces, usage, of, a, barlow, lens, increases, the, effective, focal, length, of, an, optical, system, multiplies, image, quality, reduction, similar, minor, effects, may, be, present, when, using, star, diagonals, as, light, travels, through, a, multitude, of, lenses, that, increase, or, decrease, effective, focal, length, the, quality, of, the, image, generally, depends, on, the, quality, of, the, optics, lenses, and, viewing, conditions, not, on, magnification, magnification, itself, is, limited, by, optical, characteristics, with, any, telescope, or, microscope, beyond, a, practical, maximum, magnification, the, image, looks, bigger, but, shows, no, more, detail, it, occurs, when, the, finest, detail, the, instrument, can, resolve, is, magnified, to, match, the, finest, detail, the, eye, can, see, magnification, beyond, this, maximum, is, sometimes, called, empty, magnification, to, get, the, most, detail, out, of, a, telescope, it, is, critical, to, choose, the, right, magnification, for, the, object, being, observed, some, objects, appear, best, at, low, power, some, at, high, power, and, many, at, a, moderate, magnification, there, are, two, values, for, magnification, a, minimum, and, maximum, a, wider, field, of, view, eyepiece, may, be, used, to, keep, the, same, eyepiece, focal, length, whilst, providing, the, same, magnification, through, the, telescope, for, a, good, quality, telescope, operating, in, good, atmospheric, conditions, the, maximum, usable, magnification, is, limited, by, diffraction, the, visual, magnification, m, displaystyle, m, of, the, field, of, view, through, a, telescope, can, be, determined, by, the, telescope, s, focal, length, f, displaystyle, f, divided, by, the, eyepiece, focal, length, f, e, displaystyle, f, e, or, diameter, the, maximum, is, limited, by, the, focal, length, of, the, eyepiece, an, example, of, visual, magnification, using, a, telescope, with, a, 1200, mm, focal, length, and, 3, mm, eyepiece, is, given, by, m, f, f, e, 1200, 3, 400, displaystyle, m, frac, f, f, e, frac, 1200, 3, 400, there, are, two, issues, constraining, the, lowest, useful, magnification, on, a, telescope, both, constraints, boil, down, to, approximately, the, same, rule, the, magnification, of, the, viewed, image, m, displaystyle, m, must, be, high, enough, to, make, the, eyepiece, exit, pupil, d, e, p, displaystyle, d, mathsf, ep, no, larger, than, the, pupil, of, the, observer, s, own, eye, the, formula, for, the, eypiece, exit, pupil, is, where, d, displaystyle, d, is, the, light, collecting, diameter, of, the, telescope, s, aperture, dark, adapted, pupil, sizes, range, from, 8, 9, mm, for, young, children, to, a, normal, or, standard, value, of, 7, mm, for, most, adults, aged, 30, 40, to, 5, 6, mm, for, retirees, in, their, 60s, and, 70s, a, lifetime, spent, exposed, to, chronically, bright, ambient, light, such, as, sunlight, reflected, off, of, open, fields, of, snow, or, white, sand, beaches, or, cement, will, tend, to, make, individuals, pupils, permanently, smaller, sunglasses, greatly, help, but, once, shrunk, by, long, time, over, exposure, to, bright, light, even, the, use, of, opthamalogic, drugs, cannot, restore, lost, pupil, size, most, observers, eyes, instantly, respond, to, darkness, by, widening, the, pupil, to, almost, its, maximum, although, complete, adaption, to, night, vision, generally, takes, at, least, a, half, hour, there, is, usually, a, slight, extra, widening, of, the, pupil, the, longer, the, pupil, remains, dilated, relaxed, the, improvement, in, brightness, with, reduced, magnification, has, a, limit, related, to, something, called, the, exit, pupil, the, exit, pupil, is, the, cylinder, of, light, exiting, the, eyepiece, and, entering, the, pupil, of, the, eye, hence, the, lower, the, magnification, the, larger, the, exit, pupil, it, is, the, image, of, the, shrunken, sky, viewing, aperture, of, the, telescope, reduced, by, the, magnification, factor, m, displaystyle, m, of, the, eyepiece, telescope, combination, where, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, focal, length, of, the, telescope, and, displaystyle, ell, is, the, focal, length, of, the, eyepiece, ideally, the, exit, pupil, of, the, eyepiece, d, e, p, displaystyle, d, mathsf, ep, matches, the, pupil, of, the, observer, s, eye, if, the, exit, pupil, from, the, eyepiece, is, larger, than, the, pupil, of, individual, observer, s, eye, some, of, the, light, delivered, from, the, telescope, will, be, cut, off, if, the, eyepiece, exit, pupil, is, the, same, or, smaller, than, the, pupil, of, the, observer, s, eye, then, all, of, the, light, collected, by, the, telescope, aperture, will, enter, the, eye, with, lower, magnification, producing, a, brighter, image, as, long, as, all, of, the, captured, light, gets, into, the, eye, the, minimum, m, m, i, n, displaystyle, m, mathsf, min, can, be, calculated, by, dividing, the, telescope, aperture, d, displaystyle, d, over, the, largest, tolerated, exit, pupil, diameter, d, e, p, displaystyle, d, mathsf, ep, decreasing, the, magnification, past, this, limit, will, not, increase, brightness, nor, improve, clarity, beyond, this, limit, there, is, no, benefit, from, lower, magnification, likewise, calculating, the, exit, pupil, d, e, p, displaystyle, d, mathsf, ep, is, a, division, of, the, aperture, diameter, d, displaystyle, d, and, the, visual, magnification, m, displaystyle, m, used, the, minimum, often, may, not, be, reachable, with, some, telescopes, a, telescope, with, a, very, long, focal, length, may, require, a, longer, focal, length, eyepiece, than, is, available, an, example, of, the, lowest, usable, magnification, using, a, fairly, common, 10, 254, mm, aperture, and, the, standard, adult, 7, mm, maximum, exit, pupil, is, given, by, m, m, i, n, d, d, e, p, 254, 7, 36, displaystyle, m, mathsf, min, frac, d, d, mathsf, ep, frac, 254, 7, approx, 36, times, if, the,

from, the, combination, where, the, fov, cannot, be, viewed, larger, than, a, defined, maximum, due, to, diffraction, of, the, optics, apparent, field, of, view, commonly, referred, to, as, afov, is, the, perceived, angular, size, of, the, field, stop, of, the, eyepiece, typically, measured, in, degrees, it, is, a, fixed, property, of, the, eyepiece, s, optical, design, with, common, commercially, available, eyepieces, offering, a, range, of, apparent, fields, from, 40, to, 120, the, apparent, field, of, view, of, an, eyepiece, is, limited, by, a, combination, of, the, eyepiece, s, field, stop, diameter, and, focal, length, and, is, independent, of, magnification, used, in, an, eyepiece, with, a, very, wide, apparent, field, of, view, the, observer, may, perceive, that, the, view, through, the, telescope, stretches, out, to, their, peripheral, vision, giving, a, sensation, that, they, are, no, longer, looking, through, an, eyepiece, or, that, they, are, closer, to, the, subject, of, interest, than, they, really, are, in, contrast, an, eyepiece, with, a, narrow, apparent, field, of, view, may, give, the, sensation, of, looking, through, a, tunnel, or, small, porthole, window, with, the, black, field, stop, of, the, eyepiece, occupying, most, of, the, observer, s, vision, a, wider, apparent, field, of, view, permits, the, observer, to, see, more, of, the, subject, of, interest, that, is, a, wider, true, field, of, view, without, reducing, magnification, to, do, so, however, the, relationship, between, true, field, of, view, apparent, field, of, view, and, magnification, is, not, direct, due, to, increasing, distortion, characteristics, that, correlate, with, wider, apparent, fields, of, view, instead, both, true, field, of, view, and, apparent, field, of, view, are, consequences, of, the, eyepiece, s, field, stop, diameter, apparent, field, of, view, differs, from, true, field, of, view, in, so, far, as, true, field, of, view, varies, with, magnification, whereas, apparent, field, of, view, does, not, the, wider, field, stop, of, a, wide, angle, eyepiece, permits, the, viewing, of, a, wider, section, of, the, real, image, formed, at, the, telescope, s, focal, plane, thus, impacting, the, calculated, true, field, of, view, an, eyepiece, s, apparent, field, of, view, can, influence, total, view, brightness, as, perceived, by, the, eye, since, the, apparent, angular, size, of, the, field, stop, will, determine, how, much, of, the, observer, s, retina, is, illuminated, by, the, exit, pupil, formed, by, the, eyepiece, however, apparent, field, of, view, has, no, impact, on, the, apparent, surface, brightness, that, is, brightness, per, unit, area, of, objects, contained, within, the, field, of, view, true, fov, is, the,

experimentation, are, the, major, contributors, to, understanding, how, to, maximize, one, s, observations, in, practice, only, two, main, properties, of, a, telescope, determine, how, observation,

suitable, focal, length, or, diameter, comparing, the, observable, world, and, the, angular, diameter, of, an, object, shows, how, much, of, the, object, we, see, however, the, relationship, with, the, optical, system, may, not, result, in, high, surface, brightness, celestial, objects, are, often, dim, because, of, their, vast, distance, and, detail, may, be, limited, by, diffraction, or, unsuitable, optical, properties, finding, what, can, be, seen, through, the, optical, system, begins, with, the, eyepiece, providing, the, field, of, view, and, magnification, the, magnification, is, given, by, the, division, of, the, telescope, and, eyepiece, focal, lengths, using, an, example, of, an, amateur, telescope, such, as, a, newtonian, telescope, with, an, aperture, d, displaystyle, d, of, 130, mm, 5, and, focal, length, f, displaystyle, f, of, 650, mm, 25, 5, inches, one, uses, an, eyepiece, with, a, focal, length, d, displaystyle, d, of, 8, mm, and, apparent, fov, v, a,

frac, v, a, m, frac, 52, 81, 25, 0, 64, the, resulting, true, field, of, view, is, 0, 64, not, allowing, an, object, such, as, the, orion, nebula, which, appears, elliptical, with, an, angular, diameter, of, 65, 60, arcminutes, to, be, viewable, through, the, telescope, in, its, entirety, where, the, whole, of, the, nebula, is, within, the, observable, world, using, methods, such, as, this, can, greatly, increase, one, s, viewing, potential, ensuring, the, observable, world, can, contain, the, entire, object, or, whether, to, increase, or, decrease, magnification, viewing, the, object, in, a, different, aspect, the, surface, brightness, at, such, a, magnification, significantly, reduces, resulting, in, a, far, dimmer, appearance, a, dimmer, appearance, results, in, less, visual, detail, of, the, object, details, such, as, matter, rings, spiral, arms, and, gases, may, be, completely, hidden, from, the, observer, giving, a, far, less, complete, view, of, the, object, or, range, physics, dictates, that, at, the, theoretical, minimum, magnification, of, the, telescope, the, surface, brightness, is, at, 100, practically, however, various, factors, prevent, 100, brightness, these, include, telescope, limitations, focal, length, eyepiece, focal, length, etc, and, the, age, of, the, observer, age, plays, a, role, in, brightness, as, a, contributing, factor, is, the, observer, s, pupil, with, age, the, pupil, naturally, shrinks, in, diameter, generally, accepted, a, young, adult, may, have, a, 7, mm, diameter, pupil, an, older, adult, as, little, as, 5, mm, and, a, younger, person, larger, at, 9, mm, the, minimum, magnification, m, displaystyle, m, can, be, expressed, as, the, division, of, the, aperture, d, displaystyle, d, and, pupil, p, displaystyle, p, diameter, given, by, m, d, d, 130, 7, 18, 6, displaystyle, m, frac, d, d, frac, 130, 7, approx, 18, 6, a, problematic, instance, may, be, apparent, achieving, a, theoretical, surface, brightness, of, 100, as, the, required, effective, focal, length, of, the, optical, system, may, require, an, eyepiece, with, too, large, a, diameter, some, telescopes, cannot, achieve, the, theoretical, surface, brightness, of, 100, while, some, telescopes, can, achieve, it, using, a, very, small, diameter, eyepiece, to, find, what, eyepiece, is, required, to, get, minimum, magnification, one, can, rearrange, the, magnification, formula, where, it, is, now, the, division, of, the, telescope, s, focal, length, over, the, minimum, magnification, f, m, 650, 18, 6, 35, displaystyle, frac, f, m, frac, 650, 18, 6, approx, 35, an, eyepiece, of, 35, mm, is, a, non, standard, size, and, would, not, be, purchasable, in, this, scenario, to, achieve, 100, one, would, require, a, standard, manufactured, eyepiece, size, of, 40, mm, as, the, eyepiece, has, a, larger, focal, length, than, the, minimum, magnification, an, abundance, of, wasted, light, is, not, received, through, the, eyes, the, limit, to, the, increase, in, surface, brightness, as, one, reduces, magnification, is, the, exit, pupil, a, cylinder, of, light, that, projects, out, the, eyepiece, to, the, observer, an, exit, pupil, must, match, or, be, smaller, in, diameter, than, one, s, pupil, to, receive, the, full, amount, of, projected, light, a, larger, exit, pupil, results, in, the, wasted, light, the, exit, pupil, e, displaystyle, e, can, be, derived, with, from, division, of, the, telescope, aperture, d, displaystyle, d, and, the, minimum, magnification, m, displaystyle, m, derived, by, e, d, m, 130, 18, 6, 7, displaystyle, e, frac, d, m, frac, 130, 18, 6, approx, 7, the, pupil, and, exit, pupil, are, almost, identical, in, diameter, giving, no, wasted, observable, light, with, the, optical, system, a, 7, mm, pupil, falls, slightly, short, of, 100, brightness, where, the, surface, brightness, b, displaystyle, b, can, be, measured, from, the, product, of, the, constant, 2, by, the, square, of, the, pupil, p, displaystyle, p, resulting, in, b, 2, p, 2, 2, 7, 2, 98, displaystyle, b, 2, p, 2, 2, 7, 2, 98, the, limitation, here, is, the, pupil, diameter, it, is, an, unfortunate, result, and, degrades, with, age, some, observable, light, loss, is, expected, and, decreasing, the, magnification, cannot, increase, surface, brightness, once, the, system, has, reached, its, minimum, usable, magnification, hence, why, the, term, is, referred, to, as, usable, when, using, a, ccd, to, record, observations, the, ccd, is, placed, in, the, focal, plane, image, scale, sometimes, called, plate, scale, is, how, the, angular, size, of, the, object, being, observed, is, related, to, the, physical, size, of, the, projected, image, in, the, focal, plane, i, s, displaystyle, i, frac, alpha, s, where, i, displaystyle, i, is, the, image, scale, displaystyle, alpha, is, the, angular, size, of, the, observed, object, and, s, displaystyle, s, is, the, physical, size, of, the, projected, image, in, terms, of, focal, length, image, scale, is, i, 1, f, displaystyle, i, frac, 1, f, where, i, displaystyle, i, is, measured, in, radians, per, meter, rad, m, and, f, displaystyle, f, is, measured, in, meters, normally, i, displaystyle, i, is, given, in, units, of, arcseconds, per, millimeter, mm, so, if, the, focal, length, is, measured, in, millimeters, the, image, scale, is, i, m, m, 1, f, m, m, 180, 3600, displaystyle, i, mathrm, mm, frac, 1, f, mathrm, mm, left, the, derivation, of, this, equation, is, fairly, straightforward, and, the, result, is, the, same, for, reflecting, or, refracting, telescopes, however, conceptually, it, is, easier, to, derive, by, considering, a, reflecting, telescope, if, an, extended, object, with, angular, size, displaystyle, alpha, is, observed, through, a, telescope, then, due, to, the, laws, of, reflection, and, trigonometry, the, size, of, the, image, projected, onto, the, focal, plane, will, be, s, tan, f, displaystyle, s, tan, alpha, f, the, image, scale, angular, size, of, object, divided, by, size, of, projected, image, will, be, i, s, tan, f, displaystyle, i, frac, alpha, s, frac, alpha, tan, alpha, f, and, by, using, the, small, angle, relation, tan, a, a, displaystyle, tan, a, approx, a, when, a, 1, displaystyle, a, ll, 1, n, b, only, valid, if, a, displaystyle, a, is, in, radians, we, obtain, i, f, 1, f, displaystyle, i, frac, alpha, alpha, f, frac, 1, f, no, telescope, can, form, a, perfect, image, even, if, a, reflecting, telescope, could, have, a, perfect, mirror, or, a, refracting, telescope, could, have, a, perfect, lens, the, effects, of, aperture, diffraction, are, unavoidable, in, reality, perfect, mirrors, and, perfect, lenses, do, not, exist, so, image, aberrations, in, addition, to, aperture, diffraction, must, be, taken, into, account, image, aberrations, can, be, broken, down, into, two, main, classes, monochromatic, and, polychromatic, in, 1857, philipp, ludwig, von, seidel, 1821, 1896, decomposed, the, first, order, monochromatic, aberrations, into, five, constituent, aberrations, they, are, now, commonly, referred, to, as, the, five, seidel, aberrations, optical, defects, are, always, listed, in, the, above, order, since, this, expresses, their, interdependence, as, first, order, aberrations, via, moves, of, the, exit, entrance, pupils, the, first, seidel, aberration, spherical, aberration, is, independent, of, the, position, of, the, exit, pupil, as, it, is, the, same, for, axial, and, extra, axial, pencils, the, second, coma, changes, as, a, function, of, pupil, distance, and, spherical, aberration, hence, the, well, known, result, that, it, is, impossible, to, correct, the, coma, in, a, lens, free, of, spherical, aberration, by, simply, moving, the, pupil, similar, dependencies, affect, the, remaining, aberrations, in, the, list, optical, telescopes, have, been, used, in, astronomical, research, since, the, time, of, their, invention, in, the, early, 17th, century, many, types, have, been, constructed, over, the, years, depending, on, the, optical, technology, such, as, refracting, and, reflecting, the, nature, of, the, light, or, object, being, imaged, and, even, where, they, are, placed, such, as, space, telescopes, some, are, classified, by, the, task, they, perform, such, as, solar, telescopes, nearly, all, large, research, grade, astronomical, telescopes, are, reflectors, some, reasons, are, most, large, research, reflectors, operate, at, different, focal, planes, depending, on, the, type, and, size, of, the, instrument, being, used, these, including, the, prime, focus, of, the, main, mirror, the, cassegrain, focus, light, bounced, back, down, behind, the, primary, mirror, and, even, external, to, the, telescope, all, together, such, as, the, nasmyth, and, coud, focus, a, new, era, of, telescope, making, was, inaugurated, by, the, multiple, mirror, telescope, mmt, with, a, mirror, composed, of, six, segments, synthesizing, a, mirror, of, 4, 5, meters, diameter, this, has, now, been, replaced, by, a, single, 6, 5, m, mirror, its, example, was, followed, by, the, keck, telescopes, with, 10, m, segmented, mirrors, the, largest, current, ground, based, telescopes, have, a, primary, mirror, of, between, 6, and, 11, meters, in, diameter, in, this, generation, of, telescopes, the, mirror, is, usually, very, thin, and, is, kept, in, an, optimal, shape, by, an, array, of, actuators, see, active, optics, this, technology, has, driven, new, designs, for, future, telescopes, with, diameters, of, 30, 50, and, even, 100, meters, relatively, cheap, mass, produced, 2, meter, telescopes, have, recently, been, developed, and, have, made, a, significant, impact, on, astronomy, research, these, allow, many, astronomical, targets, to, be, monitored, continuously, and, for, large, areas, of, sky, to, be, surveyed, many, are, robotic, telescopes, computer, controlled, over, the, internet, see, e, g, the, liverpool, telescope, and, the, faulkes, telescope, north, and, south, allowing, automated, follow, up, of, astronomical, events, initially, the, detector, used, in, telescopes, was, the, human, eye, later, the, sensitized, photographic, plate, took, its, place, and, the, spectrograph, was, introduced, allowing, the, gathering, of, spectral, information, after, the, photographic, plate, successive, generations, of, electronic, detectors, such, as, the, charge, coupled, device, ccds, have, been, perfected, each, with, more, sensitivity, and, resolution, and, often, with, a, wider, wavelength, coverage, current, research, telescopes, have, several, instruments, to, choose, from, such, as, the, phenomenon, of, optical, diffraction, sets, a, limit, to, the, resolution, and, image, quality, that, a, telescope, can, achieve, which, is, the, effective, area, of, the, airy, disc, which, limits, how, close, two, such, discs, can, be, placed, this, absolute, limit, is, called, the, diffraction, limit, and, may, be, approximated, by, the, rayleigh, criterion, dawes, limit, or, sparrow, s, resolution, limit, this, limit, depends, on, the, wavelength, of, the, studied, light, so, that, the, limit, for, red, light, comes, much, earlier, than, the, limit, for, blue, light, and, on, the, diameter, of, the, telescope, mirror, this, means, that, a, telescope, with, a, certain, mirror, diameter, can, theoretically, resolve, up, to, a, certain, limit, at, a, certain, wavelength, for, conventional, telescopes, on, earth, the, diffraction, limit, is, not, relevant, for, telescopes, bigger, than, about, 10, cm, instead, the, seeing, or, blur, caused, by, the, atmosphere, sets, the, resolution, limit, but, in, space, or, if, adaptive, optics, are, used, then, reaching, the, diffraction, limit, is, sometimes, possible, at, this, point, if, greater, resolution, is, needed, at, that, wavelength, a, wider, mirror, has, to, be, built, or, aperture, synthesis, performed, using, an, array, of, nearby, telescopes, in, recent, years, a, number, of, technologies, to, overcome, the, distortions, caused, by, atmosphere, on, ground, based, telescopes, have, been, developed, with, good, results, see, adaptive, optics, speckle, imaging, and, optical, interferometry
