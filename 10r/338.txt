an, engine, or, motor, is, a, machine, designed, to, convert, one, or, more, forms, of, energy, into, mechanical, energy, available, energy, sources, include, potential, energy, e, g, energy, of, the, earth, s, gravitational, field, as, exploited, in, hydroelectric, power, generation, heat, energy, e, g, geothermal, chemical, energy, electric, potential, and, nuclear, energy, from, nuclear, fission, or, nuclear, fusion, many, of, these, processes, generate, heat, as, an, intermediate, energy, form, thus, heat, engines, have, special, importance, some, natural, processes, such, as, atmospheric, convection, cells, convert, environmental, heat, into, motion, e, g, in, the, form, of, rising, air, currents, mechanical, energy, is, of, particular, importance, in, transportation, but, also, plays, a, role, in, many, industrial, processes, such, as, cutting, grinding, crushing, and, mixing, mechanical, heat, engines, convert, heat, into, work, via, various, thermodynamic, processes, the, internal, combustion, engine, is, perhaps, the, most, common, example, of, a, mechanical, heat, engine, in, which, heat, from, the, combustion, of, a, fuel, causes, rapid, pressurisation, of, the, gaseous, combustion, products, in, the, combustion, chamber, causing, them, to, expand, and, drive, a, piston, which, turns, a, crankshaft, unlike, internal, combustion, engines, a, reaction, engine, such, as, a, jet, engine, produces, thrust, by, expelling, reaction, mass, in, accordance, with, newton, s, third, law, of, motion, apart, from, heat, engines, electric, motors, convert, electrical, energy, into, mechanical, motion, pneumatic, motors, use, compressed, air, and, clockwork, motors, in, wind, up, toys, use, elastic, energy, in, biological, systems, molecular, motors, like, myosins, in, muscles, use, chemical, energy, to, create, forces, and, ultimately, motion, a, chemical, engine, but, not, a, heat, engine, chemical, heat, engines, which, employ, air, ambient, atmospheric, gas, as, a, part, of, the, fuel, reaction, are, regarded, as, airbreathing, engines, chemical, heat, engines, designed, to, operate, outside, of, earth, s, atmosphere, e, g, rockets, deeply, submerged, submarines, need, to, carry, an, additional, fuel, component, called, the, oxidizer, although, there, exist, super, oxidizers, suitable, for, use, in, rockets, such, as, fluorine, a, more, powerful, oxidant, than, oxygen, itself, or, the, application, needs, to, obtain, heat, by, non, chemical, means, such, as, by, means, of, nuclear, reactions, all, chemically, fueled, heat, engines, emit, exhaust, gases, the, cleanest, engines, emit, water, only, strict, zero, emissions, generally, means, zero, emissions, other, than, water, and, water, vapour, only, heat, engines, which, combust, pure, hydrogen, fuel, and, pure, oxygen, oxidizer, achieve, zero, emission, by, a, strict, definition, in, practice, one, type, of, rocket, engine, if, hydrogen, is, burnt, in, combination, with, air, all, airbreathing, engines, a, side, reaction, occurs, between, atmospheric, oxygen, and, atmospheric, nitrogen, resulting, in, small, emissions, of, no, x, if, a, hydrocarbon, such, as, alcohol, or, gasoline, is, burnt, as, fuel, co, 2, a, greenhouse, gas, is, emitted, hydrogen, and, oxygen, from, air, can, be, reacted, into, water, by, a, fuel, cell, without, side, production, of, no, x, but, this, is, an, electrochemical, engine, not, a, heat, engine, the, word, engine, derives, from, old, french, engin, from, the, latin, ingenium, the, root, of, the, word, ingenious, pre, industrial, weapons, of, war, such, as, catapults, trebuchets, and, battering, rams, were, called, siege, engines, and, knowledge, of, how, to, construct, them, was, often, treated, as, a, military, secret, the, word, gin, as, in, cotton, gin, is, short, for, engine, most, mechanical, devices, invented, during, the, industrial, revolution, were, described, as, engines, the, steam, engine, being, a, notable, example, however, the, original, steam, engines, such, as, those, by, thomas, savery, were, not, mechanical, engines, but, pumps, in, this, manner, a, fire, engine, in, its, original, form, was, merely, a, water, pump, with, the, engine, being, transported, to, the, fire, by, horses, in, modern, usage, the, term, engine, typically, describes, devices, like, steam, engines, and, internal, combustion, engines, that, burn, or, otherwise, consume, fuel, to, perform, mechanical, work, by, exerting, a, torque, or, linear, force, usually, in, the, form, of, thrust, devices, converting, heat, energy, into, motion, are, commonly, referred, to, simply, as, engines, examples, of, engines, which, exert, a, torque, include, the, familiar, automobile, gasoline, and, diesel, engines, as, well, as, turboshafts, examples, of, engines, which, produce, thrust, include, turbofans, and, rockets, when, the, internal, combustion, engine, was, invented, the, term, motor, was, initially, used, to, distinguish, it, from, the, steam, engine, which, was, in, wide, use, at, the, time, powering, locomotives, and, other, vehicles, such, as, steam, rollers, the, term, motor, derives, from, the, latin, verb, moto, which, means, to, set, in, motion, or, maintain, motion, thus, a, motor, is, a, device, that, imparts, motion, motor, and, engine, are, interchangeable, in, standard, english, in, some, engineering, jargons, the, two, words, have, different, meanings, in, which, engine, is, a, device, that, burns, or, otherwise, consumes, fuel, changing, its, chemical, composition, and, a, motor, is, a, device, driven, by, electricity, air, or, hydraulic, pressure, which, does, not, change, the, chemical, composition, of, its, energy, source, however, rocketry, uses, the, term, rocket, motor, even, though, they, consume, fuel, a, heat, engine, may, also, serve, as, a, prime, mover, a, component, that, transforms, the, flow, or, changes, in, pressure, of, a, fluid, into, mechanical, energy, an, automobile, powered, by, an, internal, combustion, engine, may, make, use, of, various, motors, and, pumps, but, ultimately, all, such, devices, derive, their, power, from, the, engine, another, way, of, looking, at, it, is, that, a, motor, receives, power, from, an, external, source, and, then, converts, it, into, mechanical, energy, while, an, engine, creates, power, from, pressure, derived, directly, from, the, explosive, force, of, combustion, or, other, chemical, reaction, or, secondarily, from, the, action, of, some, such, force, on, other, substances, such, as, air, water, or, steam, simple, machines, such, as, the, club, and, oar, examples, of, the, lever, are, prehistoric, more, complex, engines, using, human, power, animal, power, water, power, wind, power, and, even, steam, power, date, back, to, antiquity, human, power, was, focused, by, the, use, of, simple, engines, such, as, the, capstan, windlass, or, treadmill, and, with, ropes, pulleys, and, block, and, tackle, arrangements, this, power, was, transmitted, usually, with, the, forces, multiplied, and, the, speed, reduced, these, were, used, in, cranes, and, aboard, ships, in, ancient, greece, as, well, as, in, mines, water, pumps, and, siege, engines, in, ancient, rome, the, writers, of, those, times, including, vitruvius, frontinus, and, pliny, the, elder, treat, these, engines, as, commonplace, so, their, invention, may, be, more, ancient, by, the, 1st, century, ad, cattle, and, horses, were, used, in, mills, driving, machines, similar, to, those, powered, by, humans, in, earlier, times, according, to, strabo, a, water, powered, mill, was, built, in, kaberia, of, the, kingdom, of, mithridates, during, the, 1st, century, bc, use, of, water, wheels, in, mills, spread, throughout, the, roman, empire, over, the, next, few, centuries, some, were, quite, complex, with, aqueducts, dams, and, sluices, to, maintain, and, channel, the, water, along, with, systems, of, gears, or, toothed, wheels, made, of, wood, and, metal, to, regulate, the, speed, of, rotation, more, sophisticated, small, devices, such, as, the, antikythera, mechanism, used, complex, trains, of, gears, and, dials, to, act, as, calendars, or, predict, astronomical, events, in, a, poem, by, ausonius, in, the, 4th, century, ad, he, mentions, a, stone, cutting, saw, powered, by, water, hero, of, alexandria, is, credited, with, many, such, wind, and, steam, powered, machines, in, the, 1st, century, ad, including, the, aeolipile, and, the, vending, machine, often, these, machines, were, associated, with, worship, such, as, animated, altars, and, automated, temple, doors, medieval, muslim, engineers, employed, gears, in, mills, and, water, raising, machines, and, used, dams, as, a, source, of, water, power, to, provide, additional, power, to, watermills, and, water, raising, machines, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, such, advances, made, it, possible, to, mechanize, many, industrial, tasks, previously, carried, out, by, manual, labour, in, 1206, al, jazari, employed, a, crank, conrod, system, for, two, of, his, water, raising, machines, a, rudimentary, steam, turbine, device, was, described, by, taqi, al, din, in, 1551, and, by, giovanni, branca, in, 1629, in, the, 13th, century, the, solid, rocket, motor, was, invented, in, china, driven, by, gunpowder, this, simplest, form, of, internal, combustion, engine, was, unable, to, deliver, sustained, power, but, was, useful, for, propelling, weaponry, at, high, speeds, towards, enemies, in, battle, and, for, fireworks, after, invention, this, innovation, spread, throughout, europe, the, watt, steam, engine, was, the, first, type, of, steam, engine, to, make, use, of, steam, at, a, pressure, just, above, atmospheric, to, drive, the, piston, helped, by, a, partial, vacuum, improving, on, the, design, of, the, 1712, newcomen, steam, engine, the, watt, steam, engine, developed, sporadically, from, 1763, to, 1775, was, a, great, step, in, the, development, of, the, steam, engine, offering, a, dramatic, increase, in, fuel, efficiency, james, watt, s, design, became, synonymous, with, steam, engines, due, in, no, small, part, to, his, business, partner, matthew, boulton, it, enabled, rapid, development, of, efficient, semi, automated, factories, on, a, previously, unimaginable, scale, in, places, where, waterpower, was, not, available, later, development, led, to, steam, locomotives, and, great, expansion, of, railway, transportation, as, for, internal, combustion, piston, engines, these, were, tested, in, france, in, 1807, by, de, rivaz, and, independently, by, the, ni, pce, brothers, they, were, theoretically, advanced, by, carnot, in, 1824, in, 1853, 57, eugenio, barsanti, and, felice, matteucci, invented, and, patented, an, engine, using, the, free, piston, principle, that, was, possibly, the, first, 4, cycle, engine, the, invention, of, an, internal, combustion, engine, which, was, later, commercially, successful, was, made, during, 1860, by, etienne, lenoir, in, 1877, the, otto, cycle, was, capable, of, giving, a, far, higher, power, to, weight, ratio, than, steam, engines, and, worked, much, better, for, many, transportation, applications, such, as, cars, and, aircraft, the, first, commercially, successful, automobile, created, by, karl, benz, added, to, the, interest, in, light, and, powerful, engines, the, lightweight, gasoline, internal, combustion, engine, operating, on, a, four, stroke, otto, cycle, has, been, the, most, successful, for, light, automobiles, while, the, thermally, more, efficient, diesel, engine, is, used, for, trucks, and, buses, however, in, recent, years, turbocharged, diesel, engines, have, become, increasingly, popular, in, automobiles, especially, outside, of, the, united, states, even, for, quite, small, cars, in, 1896, karl, benz, was, granted, a, patent, for, his, design, of, the, first, engine, with, horizontally, opposed, pistons, his, design, created, an, engine, in, which, the, corresponding, pistons, move, in, horizontal, cylinders, and, reach, top, dead, center, simultaneously, thus, automatically, balancing, each, other, with, respect, to, their, individual, momentum, engines, of, this, design, are, often, referred, to, as, flat, or, boxer, engines, due, to, their, shape, and, low, profile, they, were, used, in, the, volkswagen, beetle, the, citro, n, 2cv, some, porsche, and, subaru, cars, many, bmw, and, honda, motorcycles, opposed, four, and, six, cylinder, engines, continue, to, be, used, as, a, power, source, in, small, propeller, driven, aircraft, the, continued, use, of, internal, combustion, engines, in, automobiles, is, partly, due, to, the, improvement, of, engine, control, systems, such, as, on, board, computers, providing, engine, management, processes, and, electronically, controlled, fuel, injection, forced, air, induction, by, turbocharging, and, supercharging, have, increased, the, power, output, of, smaller, displacement, engines, that, are, lighter, in, weight, and, more, fuel, efficient, at, normal, cruise, power, similar, changes, have, been, applied, to, smaller, diesel, engines, giving, them, almost, the, same, performance, characteristics, as, gasoline, engines, this, is, especially, evident, with, the, popularity, of, smaller, diesel, engine, propelled, cars, in, europe, diesel, engines, produce, lower, hydrocarbon, and, co, 2, emissions, but, greater, particulate, and, no, x, pollution, than, gasoline, engines, diesel, engines, are, also, 40, more, fuel, efficient, than, comparable, gasoline, engines, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, a, trend, of, increasing, engine, power, occurred, particularly, in, the, u, s, models, design, changes, incorporated, all, known, methods, of, increasing, engine, capacity, including, increasing, the, pressure, in, the, cylinders, to, improve, efficiency, increasing, the, size, of, the, engine, and, increasing, the, rate, at, which, the, engine, produces, work, the, higher, forces, and, pressures, created, by, these, changes, created, engine, vibration, and, size, problems, that, led, to, stiffer, more, compact, engines, with, v, and, opposed, cylinder, layouts, replacing, longer, straight, line, arrangements, optimal, combustion, efficiency, in, passenger, vehicles, is, reached, with, a, coolant, temperature, of, around, 110, c, 230, f, earlier, automobile, engine, development, produced, a, much, larger, range, of, engines, than, is, in, common, use, today, engines, have, ranged, from, 1, to, 16, cylinder, designs, with, corresponding, differences, in, overall, size, weight, engine, displacement, and, cylinder, bores, four, cylinders, and, power, ratings, from, 19, to, 120, hp, 14, to, 90, kw, were, followed, in, a, majority, of, the, models, several, three, cylinder, two, stroke, cycle, models, were, built, while, most, engines, had, straight, or, in, line, cylinders, there, were, several, v, type, models, and, horizontally, opposed, two, and, four, cylinder, makes, too, overhead, camshafts, were, frequently, employed, the, smaller, engines, were, commonly, air, cooled, and, located, at, the, rear, of, the, vehicle, compression, ratios, were, relatively, low, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, saw, an, increased, interest, in, improved, fuel, economy, which, caused, a, return, to, smaller, v, 6, and, four, cylinder, layouts, with, as, many, as, five, valves, per, cylinder, to, improve, efficiency, the, bugatti, veyron, 16, 4, operates, with, a, w16, engine, meaning, that, two, v8, cylinder, layouts, are, positioned, next, to, each, other, to, create, the, w, shape, sharing, the, same, crankshaft, the, largest, internal, combustion, engine, ever, built, is, the, w, rtsil, sulzer, rta96, c, a, 14, cylinder, 2, stroke, turbocharged, diesel, engine, that, was, designed, to, power, the, emma, m, rsk, the, largest, container, ship, in, the, world, when, launched, in, 2006, this, engine, has, a, mass, of, 2, 300, tonnes, and, when, running, at, 102, rpm, 1, 7, hz, produces, over, 80, mw, and, can, use, up, to, 250, tonnes, of, fuel, per, day, an, engine, can, be, put, into, a, category, according, to, two, criteria, the, form, of, energy, it, accepts, in, order, to, create, motion, and, the, type, of, motion, it, outputs, combustion, engines, are, heat, engines, driven, by, the, heat, of, a, combustion, process, the, internal, combustion, engine, is, an, engine, in, which, the, combustion, of, a, fuel, generally, fossil, fuel, occurs, with, an, oxidizer, usually, air, in, a, combustion, chamber, in, an, internal, combustion, engine, the, expansion, of, the, high, temperature, and, high, pressure, gases, which, are, produced, by, the, combustion, directly, applies, force, to, components, of, the, engine, such, as, the, pistons, or, turbine, blades, or, a, nozzle, and, by, moving, it, over, a, distance, generates, mechanical, work, an, external, combustion, engine, ec, engine, is, a, heat, engine, where, an, internal, working, fluid, is, heated, by, combustion, of, an, external, source, through, the, engine, wall, or, a, heat, exchanger, the, fluid, then, by, expanding, and, acting, on, the, mechanism, of, the, engine, produces, motion, and, usable, work, the, fluid, is, then, cooled, compressed, and, reused, closed, cycle, or, less, commonly, dumped, and, cool, fluid, pulled, in, open, cycle, air, engine, combustion, refers, to, burning, fuel, with, an, oxidizer, to, supply, the, heat, engines, of, similar, or, even, identical, configuration, and, operation, may, use, a, supply, of, heat, from, other, sources, such, as, nuclear, solar, geothermal, or, exothermic, reactions, not, involving, combustion, but, are, not, then, strictly, classed, as, external, combustion, engines, but, as, external, thermal, engines, the, working, fluid, can, be, a, gas, as, in, a, stirling, engine, or, steam, as, in, a, steam, engine, or, an, organic, liquid, such, as, n, pentane, in, an, organic, rankine, cycle, the, fluid, can, be, of, any, composition, gas, is, by, far, the, most, common, although, even, single, phase, liquid, is, sometimes, used, in, the, case, of, the, steam, engine, the, fluid, changes, phases, between, liquid, and, gas, air, breathing, combustion, engines, are, combustion, engines, that, use, the, oxygen, in, atmospheric, air, to, oxidise, burn, the, fuel, rather, than, carrying, an, oxidiser, as, in, a, rocket, theoretically, this, should, result, in, a, better, specific, impulse, than, for, rocket, engines, a, continuous, stream, of, air, flows, through, the, air, breathing, engine, this, air, is, compressed, mixed, with, fuel, ignited, and, expelled, as, the, exhaust, gas, in, reaction, engines, the, majority, of, the, combustion, energy, heat, exits, the, engine, as, exhaust, gas, which, provides, thrust, directly, typical, air, breathing, engines, include, the, operation, of, engines, typically, has, a, negative, impact, upon, air, quality, and, ambient, sound, levels, there, has, been, a, growing, emphasis, on, the, pollution, producing, features, of, automotive, power, systems, this, has, created, new, interest, in, alternate, power, sources, and, internal, combustion, engine, refinements, though, a, few, limited, production, battery, powered, electric, vehicles, have, appeared, they, have, not, proved, competitive, owing, to, costs, and, operating, characteristics, in, the, 21st, century, the, diesel, engine, has, been, increasing, in, popularity, with, automobile, owners, however, the, gasoline, engine, and, the, diesel, engine, with, their, new, emission, control, devices, to, improve, emission, performance, have, not, yet, been, significantly, challenged, a, number, of, manufacturers, have, introduced, hybrid, engines, mainly, involving, a, small, gasoline, engine, coupled, with, an, electric, motor, and, with, a, large, battery, bank, these, are, starting, to, become, a, popular, option, because, of, their, environment, awareness, exhaust, gas, from, a, spark, ignition, engine, consists, of, the, following, nitrogen, 70, to, 75, by, volume, water, vapor, 10, to, 12, carbon, dioxide, 10, to, 13, 5, hydrogen, 0, 5, to, 2, oxygen, 0, 2, to, 2, carbon, monoxide, 0, 1, to, 6, unburnt, hydrocarbons, and, partial, oxidation, products, e, g, aldehydes, 0, 5, to, 1, nitrogen, monoxide, 0, 01, to, 0, 4, nitrous, oxide, 100, ppm, sulfur, dioxide, 15, to, 60, ppm, traces, of, other, compounds, such, as, fuel, additives, and, lubricants, also, halogen, and, metallic, compounds, and, other, particles, carbon, monoxide, is, highly, toxic, and, can, cause, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, so, it, is, important, to, avoid, any, build, up, of, the, gas, in, a, confined, space, catalytic, converters, can, reduce, toxic, emissions, but, not, eliminate, them, also, resulting, greenhouse, gas, emissions, chiefly, carbon, dioxide, from, the, widespread, use, of, engines, in, the, modern, industrialized, world, is, contributing, to, the, global, greenhouse, effect, a, primary, concern, regarding, global, warming, some, engines, convert, heat, from, noncombustive, processes, into, mechanical, work, for, example, a, nuclear, power, plant, uses, the, heat, from, the, nuclear, reaction, to, produce, steam, and, drive, a, steam, engine, or, a, gas, turbine, in, a, rocket, engine, may, be, driven, by, decomposing, hydrogen, peroxide, apart, from, the, different, energy, source, the, engine, is, often, engineered, much, the, same, as, an, internal, or, external, combustion, engine, another, group, of, noncombustive, engines, includes, thermoacoustic, heat, engines, sometimes, called, ta, engines, which, are, thermoacoustic, devices, that, use, high, amplitude, sound, waves, to, pump, heat, from, one, place, to, another, or, conversely, use, a, heat, difference, to, induce, high, amplitude, sound, waves, in, general, thermoacoustic, engines, can, be, divided, into, standing, wave, and, travelling, wave, devices, stirling, engines, can, be, another, form, of, non, combustive, heat, engine, they, use, the, stirling, thermodynamic, cycle, to, convert, heat, into, work, an, example, is, the, alpha, type, stirling, engine, whereby, gas, flows, via, a, recuperator, between, a, hot, cylinder, and, a, cold, cylinder, which, are, attached, to, reciprocating, pistons, 90, out, of, phase, the, gas, receives, heat, at, the, hot, cylinder, and, expands, driving, the, piston, that, turns, the, crankshaft, after, expanding, and, flowing, through, the, recuperator, the, gas, rejects, heat, at, the, cold, cylinder, and, the, ensuing, pressure, drop, leads, to, its, compression, by, the, other, displacement, piston, which, forces, it, back, to, the, hot, cylinder, non, thermal, motors, usually, are, powered, by, a, chemical, reaction, but, are, not, heat, engines, examples, include, an, electric, motor, uses, electrical, energy, to, produce, mechanical, energy, usually, through, the, interaction, of, magnetic, fields, and, current, carrying, conductors, the, reverse, process, producing, electrical, energy, from, mechanical, energy, is, accomplished, by, a, generator, or, dynamo, traction, motors, used, on, vehicles, often, perform, both, tasks, electric, motors, can, be, run, as, generators, and, vice, versa, although, this, is, not, always, practical, electric, motors, are, ubiquitous, being, found, in, applications, as, diverse, as, industrial, fans, blowers, and, pumps, machine, tools, household, appliances, power, tools, and, disk, drives, they, may, be, powered, by, direct, current, for, example, a, battery, powered, portable, device, or, motor, vehicle, or, by, alternating, current, from, a, central, electrical, distribution, grid, the, smallest, motors, may, be, found, in, electric, wristwatches, medium, size, motors, of, highly, standardized, dimensions, and, characteristics, provide, convenient, mechanical, power, for, industrial, uses, the, very, largest, electric, motors, are, used, for, propulsion, of, large, ships, and, for, such, purposes, as, pipeline, compressors, with, ratings, in, the, thousands, of, kilowatts, electric, motors, may, be, classified, by, the, source, of, electric, power, by, their, internal, construction, and, by, their, application, the, physical, principle, of, production, of, mechanical, force, by, the, interactions, of, an, electric, current, and, a, magnetic, field, was, known, as, early, as, 1821, electric, motors, of, increasing, efficiency, were, constructed, throughout, the, 19th, century, but, commercial, exploitation, of, electric, motors, on, a, large, scale, required, efficient, electrical, generators, and, electrical, distribution, networks, to, reduce, the, electric, energy, consumption, from, motors, and, their, associated, carbon, footprints, various, regulatory, authorities, in, many, countries, have, introduced, and, implemented, legislation, to, encourage, the, manufacture, and, use, of, higher, efficiency, electric, motors, a, well, designed, motor, can, convert, over, 90, of, its, input, energy, into, useful, power, for, decades, when, the, efficiency, of, a, motor, is, raised, by, even, a, few, percentage, points, the, savings, in, kilowatt, hours, and, therefore, in, cost, are, enormous, the, electrical, energy, efficiency, of, a, typical, industrial, induction, motor, can, be, improved, by, 1, reducing, the, electrical, losses, in, the, stator, windings, e, g, by, increasing, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, conductor, improving, the, winding, technique, and, using, materials, with, higher, electrical, conductivities, such, as, copper, 2, reducing, the, electrical, losses, in, the, rotor, coil, or, casting, e, g, by, using, materials, with, higher, electrical, conductivities, such, as, copper, 3, reducing, magnetic, losses, by, using, better, quality, magnetic, steel, 4, improving, the, aerodynamics, of, motors, to, reduce, mechanical, windage, losses, 5, improving, bearings, to, reduce, friction, losses, and, 6, minimizing, manufacturing, tolerances, for, further, discussion, on, this, subject, see, premium, efficiency, by, convention, electric, engine, refers, to, a, railroad, electric, locomotive, rather, than, an, electric, motor, some, motors, are, powered, by, potential, or, kinetic, energy, for, example, some, funiculars, gravity, plane, and, ropeway, conveyors, have, used, the, energy, from, moving, water, or, rocks, and, some, clocks, have, a, weight, that, falls, under, gravity, other, forms, of, potential, energy, include, compressed, gases, such, as, pneumatic, motors, springs, clockwork, motors, and, elastic, bands, historic, military, siege, engines, included, large, catapults, trebuchets, and, to, some, extent, battering, rams, were, powered, by, potential, energy, a, pneumatic, motor, is, a, machine, that, converts, potential, energy, in, the, form, of, compressed, air, into, mechanical, work, pneumatic, motors, generally, convert, the, compressed, air, to, mechanical, work, through, either, linear, or, rotary, motion, linear, motion, can, come, from, either, a, diaphragm, or, piston, actuator, while, rotary, motion, is, supplied, by, either, a, vane, type, air, motor, or, piston, air, motor, pneumatic, motors, have, found, widespread, success, in, the, hand, held, tool, industry, and, continual, attempts, are, being, made, to, expand, their, use, to, the, transportation, industry, however, pneumatic, motors, must, overcome, efficiency, deficiencies, before, being, seen, as, a, viable, option, in, the, transportation, industry, a, hydraulic, motor, derives, its, power, from, a, pressurized, liquid, this, type, of, engine, is, used, to, move, heavy, loads, and, drive, machinery, some, motor, units, can, have, multiple, sources, of, energy, for, example, a, plug, in, hybrid, electric, vehicle, s, electric, motor, could, source, electricity, from, either, a, battery, or, from, fossil, fuels, inputs, via, an, internal, combustion, engine, and, a, generator, the, following, are, used, in, the, assessment, of, the, performance, of, an, engine, speed, refers, to, crankshaft, rotation, in, piston, engines, and, the, speed, of, compressor, turbine, rotors, and, electric, motor, rotors, it, is, measured, in, revolutions, per, minute, rpm, thrust, is, the, force, exerted, on, an, airplane, as, a, consequence, of, its, propeller, or, jet, engine, accelerating, the, air, passing, through, it, it, is, also, the, force, exerted, on, a, ship, as, a, consequence, of, its, propeller, accelerating, the, water, passing, through, it, torque, is, a, turning, moment, on, a, shaft, and, is, calculated, by, multiplying, the, force, causing, the, moment, by, its, distance, from, the, shaft, power, is, the, measure, of, how, fast, work, is, done, efficiency, is, a, proportion, of, useful, energy, output, compared, to, total, input, vehicle, noise, is, predominantly, from, the, engine, at, low, vehicle, speeds, and, from, tires, and, the, air, flowing, past, the, vehicle, at, higher, speeds, electric, motors, are, quieter, than, internal, combustion, engines, thrust, producing, engines, such, as, turbofans, turbojets, and, rockets, emit, the, greatest, amount, of, noise, due, to, the, way, their, thrust, producing, high,
