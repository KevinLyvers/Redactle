in, computing, a, printer, is, a, peripheral, machine, which, makes, a, durable, representation, of, graphics, or, text, usually, on, paper, while, most, output, is, human, readable, bar, code, printers, are, an, example, of, an, expanded, use, for, printers, different, types, of, printers, include, 3d, printers, inkjet, printers, laser, printers, and, thermal, printers, the, first, computer, printer, designed, was, a, mechanically, driven, apparatus, by, charles, babbage, for, his, difference, engine, in, the, 19th, century, however, his, mechanical, printer, design, was, not, built, until, 2000, the, first, patented, printing, mechanism, for, applying, a, marking, medium, to, a, recording, medium, or, more, particularly, an, electrostatic, inking, apparatus, and, a, method, for, electrostatically, depositing, ink, on, controlled, areas, of, a, receiving, medium, was, in, 1962, by, c, r, winston, teletype, corporation, using, continuous, inkjet, printing, the, ink, was, a, red, stamp, pad, ink, manufactured, by, phillips, process, company, of, rochester, ny, under, the, name, clear, print, this, patent, us3060429, led, to, the, teletype, inktronic, printer, product, delivered, to, customers, in, late, 1966, the, first, compact, lightweight, digital, printer, was, the, ep, 101, invented, by, japanese, company, epson, and, released, in, 1968, according, to, epson, the, first, commercial, printers, generally, used, mechanisms, from, electric, typewriters, and, teletype, machines, the, demand, for, higher, speed, led, to, the, development, of, new, systems, specifically, for, computer, use, in, the, 1980s, there, were, daisy, wheel, systems, similar, to, typewriters, line, printers, that, produced, similar, output, but, at, much, higher, speed, and, dot, matrix, systems, that, could, mix, text, and, graphics, but, produced, relatively, low, quality, output, the, plotter, was, used, for, those, requiring, high, quality, line, art, like, blueprints, the, introduction, of, the, low, cost, laser, printer, in, 1984, with, the, first, hp, laserjet, and, the, addition, of, postscript, in, next, year, s, apple, laserwriter, set, off, a, revolution, in, printing, known, as, desktop, publishing, laser, printers, using, postscript, mixed, text, and, graphics, like, dot, matrix, printers, but, at, quality, levels, formerly, available, only, from, commercial, typesetting, systems, by, 1990, most, simple, printing, tasks, like, fliers, and, brochures, were, now, created, on, personal, computers, and, then, laser, printed, expensive, offset, printing, systems, were, being, dumped, as, scrap, the, hp, deskjet, of, 1988, offered, the, same, advantages, as, a, laser, printer, in, terms, of, flexibility, but, produced, somewhat, lower, quality, output, depending, on, the, paper, from, much, less, expensive, mechanisms, inkjet, systems, rapidly, displaced, dot, matrix, and, daisy, wheel, printers, from, the, market, by, the, 2000s, high, quality, printers, of, this, sort, had, fallen, under, the, 100, price, point, and, became, commonplace, the, rapid, improvement, of, internet, email, through, the, 1990s, and, into, the, 2000s, has, largely, displaced, the, need, for, printing, as, a, means, of, moving, documents, and, a, wide, variety, of, reliable, storage, systems, means, that, a, physical, backup, is, of, little, benefit, today, starting, around, 2010, 3d, printing, became, an, area, of, intense, interest, allowing, the, creation, of, physical, objects, with, the, same, sort, of, effort, as, an, early, laser, printer, required, to, produce, a, brochure, as, of, the, 2020s, 3d, printing, has, become, a, widespread, hobby, due, to, the, abundance, of, cheap, 3d, printer, kits, with, the, most, common, process, being, fused, deposition, modeling, personal, printers, are, mainly, designed, to, support, individual, users, and, may, be, connected, to, only, a, single, computer, these, printers, are, designed, for, low, volume, short, turnaround, print, jobs, requiring, minimal, setup, time, to, produce, a, hard, copy, of, a, given, document, however, they, are, generally, slow, devices, ranging, from, 6, to, around, 25, pages, per, minute, ppm, and, the, cost, per, page, is, relatively, high, however, this, is, offset, by, the, on, demand, convenience, some, printers, can, print, documents, stored, on, memory, cards, or, from, digital, cameras, and, scanners, networked, or, shared, printers, are, designed, for, high, volume, high, speed, printing, they, are, usually, shared, by, many, users, on, a, network, and, can, print, at, speeds, of, 45, to, around, 100, ppm, the, xerox, 9700, could, achieve, 120, ppm, an, id, card, printer, is, used, for, printing, plastic, id, cards, these, can, now, be, customised, with, important, features, such, as, holographic, overlays, holokotes, and, watermarks, this, is, either, a, direct, to, card, printer, the, more, feasible, option, or, a, retransfer, printer, a, virtual, printer, is, a, piece, of, computer, software, whose, user, interface, and, api, resembles, that, of, a, printer, driver, but, which, is, not, connected, with, a, physical, computer, printer, a, virtual, printer, can, be, used, to, create, a, file, which, is, an, image, of, the, data, which, would, be, printed, for, archival, purposes, or, as, input, to, another, program, for, example, to, create, a, pdf, or, to, transmit, to, another, system, or, user, a, barcode, printer, is, a, computer, peripheral, for, printing, barcode, labels, or, tags, that, can, be, attached, to, or, printed, directly, on, physical, objects, barcode, printers, are, commonly, used, to, label, cartons, before, shipment, or, to, label, retail, items, with, upcs, or, eans, a, 3d, printer, is, a, device, for, making, a, three, dimensional, object, from, a, 3d, model, or, other, electronic, data, source, through, additive, processes, in, which, successive, layers, of, material, including, plastics, metals, food, cement, wood, and, other, materials, are, laid, down, under, computer, control, it, is, called, a, printer, by, analogy, with, an, inkjet, printer, which, produces, a, two, dimensional, document, by, a, similar, process, of, depositing, a, layer, of, ink, on, paper, a, card, printer, is, an, electronic, desktop, printer, with, single, card, feeders, which, print, and, personalize, plastic, cards, in, this, respect, they, differ, from, for, example, label, printers, which, have, a, continuous, supply, feed, card, dimensions, are, usually, 85, 60, 53, 98, mm, standardized, under, iso, iec, 7810, as, id, 1, this, format, is, also, used, in, ec, cards, telephone, cards, credit, cards, driver, s, licenses, and, health, insurance, cards, this, is, commonly, known, as, the, bank, card, format, card, printers, are, controlled, by, corresponding, printer, drivers, or, by, means, of, a, specific, programming, language, generally, card, printers, are, designed, with, laminating, striping, and, punching, functions, and, use, desktop, or, web, based, software, the, hardware, features, of, a, card, printer, differentiate, a, card, printer, from, the, more, traditional, printers, as, id, cards, are, usually, made, of, pvc, plastic, and, require, laminating, and, punching, different, card, printers, can, accept, different, card, thickness, and, dimensions, the, principle, is, the, same, for, practically, all, card, printers, the, plastic, card, is, passed, through, a, thermal, print, head, at, the, same, time, as, a, color, ribbon, the, color, from, the, ribbon, is, transferred, onto, the, card, through, the, heat, given, out, from, the, print, head, the, standard, performance, for, card, printing, is, 300, dpi, 300, dots, per, inch, equivalent, to, 11, 8, dots, per, mm, there, are, different, printing, processes, which, vary, in, their, detail, common, printing, problems, variations, in, card, printers, there, are, basically, two, categories, of, card, printer, software, desktop, based, and, web, based, online, the, biggest, difference, between, the, two, is, whether, or, not, a, customer, has, a, printer, on, their, network, that, is, capable, of, printing, identification, cards, if, a, business, already, owns, an, id, card, printer, then, a, desktop, based, badge, maker, is, probably, suitable, for, their, needs, typically, large, organizations, who, have, high, employee, turnover, will, have, their, own, printer, a, desktop, based, badge, maker, is, also, required, if, a, company, needs, their, ids, make, instantly, an, example, of, this, is, the, private, construction, site, that, has, restricted, access, however, if, a, company, does, not, already, have, a, local, or, network, printer, that, has, the, features, they, need, then, the, web, based, option, is, a, perhaps, a, more, affordable, solution, the, web, based, solution, is, good, for, small, businesses, that, do, not, anticipate, a, lot, of, rapid, growth, or, organizations, who, either, can, not, afford, a, card, printer, or, do, not, have, the, resources, to, learn, how, to, set, up, and, use, one, generally, speaking, desktop, based, solutions, involve, software, a, database, or, spreadsheet, and, can, be, installed, on, a, single, computer, or, network, alongside, the, basic, function, of, printing, cards, card, printers, can, also, read, and, encode, magnetic, stripes, as, well, as, contact, and, contact, free, rfid, chip, cards, smart, cards, thus, card, printers, enable, the, encoding, of, plastic, cards, both, visually, and, logically, plastic, cards, can, also, be, laminated, after, printing, plastic, cards, are, laminated, after, printing, to, achieve, a, considerable, increase, in, durability, and, a, greater, degree, of, counterfeit, prevention, some, card, printers, come, with, an, option, to, print, both, sides, at, the, same, time, which, cuts, down, the, time, taken, to, print, and, less, margin, of, error, in, such, printers, one, side, of, id, card, is, printed, and, then, the, card, is, flipped, in, the, flip, station, and, other, side, is, printed, alongside, the, traditional, uses, in, time, attendance, and, access, control, in, particular, with, photo, personalization, countless, other, applications, have, been, found, for, plastic, cards, e, g, for, personalized, customer, and, members, cards, for, sports, ticketing, and, in, local, public, transport, systems, for, the, production, of, season, tickets, for, the, production, of, school, and, college, identity, cards, as, well, as, for, the, production, of, national, id, cards, the, choice, of, print, technology, has, a, great, effect, on, the, cost, of, the, printer, and, cost, of, operation, speed, quality, and, permanence, of, documents, and, noise, some, printer, technologies, do, not, work, with, certain, types, of, physical, media, such, as, carbon, paper, or, transparencies, a, second, aspect, of, printer, technology, that, is, often, forgotten, is, resistance, to, alteration, liquid, ink, such, as, from, an, inkjet, head, or, fabric, ribbon, becomes, absorbed, by, the, paper, fibers, so, documents, printed, with, liquid, ink, are, more, difficult, to, alter, than, documents, printed, with, toner, or, solid, inks, which, do, not, penetrate, below, the, paper, surface, cheques, can, be, printed, with, liquid, ink, or, on, special, cheque, paper, with, toner, anchorage, so, that, alterations, may, be, detected, the, machine, readable, lower, portion, of, a, cheque, must, be, printed, using, micr, toner, or, ink, banks, and, other, clearing, houses, employ, automation, equipment, that, relies, on, the, magnetic, flux, from, these, specially, printed, characters, to, function, properly, the, following, printing, technologies, are, routinely, found, in, modern, printers, a, laser, printer, rapidly, produces, high, quality, text, and, graphics, as, with, digital, photocopiers, and, multifunction, printers, mfps, laser, printers, employ, a, xerographic, printing, process, but, differ, from, analog, photocopiers, in, that, the, image, is, produced, by, the, direct, scanning, of, a, laser, beam, across, the, printer, s, photoreceptor, another, toner, based, printer, is, the, led, printer, which, uses, an, array, of, leds, instead, of, a, laser, to, cause, toner, adhesion, to, the, print, drum, inkjet, printers, operate, by, propelling, variably, sized, droplets, of, liquid, ink, onto, almost, any, sized, page, they, are, the, most, common, type, of, computer, printer, used, by, consumers, solid, ink, printers, also, known, as, phase, change, ink, or, hot, melt, ink, printers, are, a, type, of, thermal, transfer, printer, graphics, sheet, printer, or, 3d, printer, they, use, solid, sticks, crayons, pearls, or, granular, ink, materials, common, inks, are, cmyk, colored, ink, similar, in, consistency, to, candle, wax, which, are, melted, and, fed, into, a, piezo, crystal, operated, print, head, a, thermal, transfer, printhead, jets, the, liquid, ink, on, a, rotating, oil, coated, drum, the, paper, then, passes, over, the, print, drum, at, which, time, the, image, is, immediately, transferred, or, transfixed, to, the, page, solid, ink, printers, are, most, commonly, used, as, color, office, printers, and, are, excellent, at, printing, on, transparencies, and, other, non, porous, media, solid, ink, is, also, called, phase, change, or, hot, melt, ink, and, was, first, used, by, data, products, and, howtek, inc, in, 1984, solid, ink, printers, can, produce, excellent, results, with, text, and, images, some, solid, ink, printers, have, evolved, to, print, 3d, models, for, example, visual, impact, corporation, of, windham, nh, was, started, by, retired, howtek, employee, richard, helinski, whose, 3d, patents, us4721635, and, then, us5136515, was, licensed, to, sanders, prototype, inc, later, named, solidscape, inc, acquisition, and, operating, costs, are, similar, to, laser, printers, drawbacks, of, the, technology, include, high, energy, consumption, and, long, warm, up, times, from, a, cold, state, also, some, users, complain, that, the, resulting, prints, are, difficult, to, write, on, as, the, wax, tends, to, repel, inks, from, pens, and, are, difficult, to, feed, through, automatic, document, feeders, but, these, traits, have, been, significantly, reduced, in, later, models, this, type, of, thermal, transfer, printer, is, only, available, from, one, manufacturer, xerox, manufactured, as, part, of, their, xerox, phaser, office, printer, line, previously, solid, ink, printers, were, manufactured, by, tektronix, but, tektronix, sold, the, printing, business, to, xerox, in, 2001, a, dye, sublimation, printer, or, dye, sub, printer, is, a, printer, that, employs, a, printing, process, that, uses, heat, to, transfer, dye, to, a, medium, such, as, a, plastic, card, paper, or, canvas, the, process, is, usually, to, lay, one, color, at, a, time, using, a, ribbon, that, has, color, panels, dye, sub, printers, are, intended, primarily, for, high, quality, color, applications, including, color, photography, and, are, less, well, suited, for, text, while, once, the, province, of, high, end, print, shops, dye, sublimation, printers, are, now, increasingly, used, as, dedicated, consumer, photo, printers, thermal, printers, work, by, selectively, heating, regions, of, special, heat, sensitive, paper, monochrome, thermal, printers, are, used, in, cash, registers, atms, gasoline, dispensers, and, some, older, inexpensive, fax, machines, colors, can, be, achieved, with, special, papers, and, different, temperatures, and, heating, rates, for, different, colors, these, colored, sheets, are, not, required, in, black, and, white, output, one, example, is, zink, a, portmanteau, of, zero, ink, the, following, technologies, are, either, obsolete, or, limited, to, special, applications, though, most, were, at, one, time, in, widespread, use, impact, printers, rely, on, a, forcible, impact, to, transfer, ink, to, the, media, the, impact, printer, uses, a, print, head, that, either, hits, the, surface, of, the, ink, ribbon, pressing, the, ink, ribbon, against, the, paper, similar, to, the, action, of, a, typewriter, or, less, commonly, hits, the, back, of, the, paper, pressing, the, paper, against, the, ink, ribbon, the, ibm, 1403, for, example, all, but, the, dot, matrix, printer, rely, on, the, use, of, fully, formed, characters, letterforms, that, represent, each, of, the, characters, that, the, printer, was, capable, of, printing, in, addition, most, of, these, printers, were, limited, to, monochrome, or, sometimes, two, color, printing, in, a, single, typeface, at, one, time, although, bolding, and, underlining, of, text, could, be, done, by, overstriking, that, is, printing, two, or, more, impressions, either, in, the, same, character, position, or, slightly, offset, impact, printers, varieties, include, typewriter, derived, printers, teletypewriter, derived, printers, daisywheel, printers, dot, matrix, printers, and, line, printers, dot, matrix, printers, remain, in, common, use, in, businesses, where, multi, part, forms, are, printed, an, overview, of, impact, printing, contains, a, detailed, description, of, many, of, the, technologies, used, several, different, computer, printers, were, simply, computer, controllable, versions, of, existing, electric, typewriters, the, friden, flexowriter, and, ibm, selectric, based, printers, were, the, most, common, examples, the, flexowriter, printed, with, a, conventional, typebar, mechanism, while, the, selectric, used, ibm, s, well, known, golf, ball, printing, mechanism, in, either, case, the, letter, form, then, struck, a, ribbon, which, was, pressed, against, the, paper, printing, one, character, at, a, time, the, maximum, speed, of, the, selectric, printer, the, faster, of, the, two, was, 15, 5, characters, per, second, the, common, teleprinter, could, easily, be, interfaced, with, the, computer, and, became, very, popular, except, for, those, computers, manufactured, by, ibm, some, models, used, a, typebox, that, was, positioned, in, the, x, and, y, axes, by, a, mechanism, and, the, selected, letter, form, was, struck, by, a, hammer, others, used, a, type, cylinder, in, a, similar, way, as, the, selectric, typewriters, used, their, type, ball, in, either, case, the, letter, form, then, struck, a, ribbon, to, print, the, letterform, most, teleprinters, operated, at, ten, characters, per, second, although, a, few, achieved, 15, cps, daisy, wheel, printers, operate, in, much, the, same, fashion, as, a, typewriter, a, hammer, strikes, a, wheel, with, petals, the, daisy, wheel, each, petal, containing, a, letter, form, at, its, tip, the, letter, form, strikes, a, ribbon, of, ink, depositing, the, ink, on, the, page, and, thus, printing, a, character, by, rotating, the, daisy, wheel, different, characters, are, selected, for, printing, these, printers, were, also, referred, to, as, letter, quality, printers, because, they, could, produce, text, which, was, as, clear, and, crisp, as, a, typewriter, the, fastest, letter, quality, printers, printed, at, 30, characters, per, second, the, term, dot, matrix, printer, is, used, for, impact, printers, that, use, a, matrix, of, small, pins, to, transfer, ink, to, the, page, the, advantage, of, dot, matrix, over, other, impact, printers, is, that, they, can, produce, graphical, images, in, addition, to, text, however, the, text, is, generally, of, poorer, quality, than, impact, printers, that, use, letterforms, type, dot, matrix, printers, can, be, broadly, divided, into, two, major, classes, dot, matrix, printers, can, either, be, character, based, or, line, based, that, is, a, single, horizontal, series, of, pixels, across, the, page, referring, to, the, configuration, of, the, print, head, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, dot, matrix, printers, were, one, of, the, more, common, types, of, printers, used, for, general, use, such, as, for, home, and, small, office, use, such, printers, normally, had, either, 9, or, 24, pins, on, the, print, head, early, 7, pin, printers, also, existed, which, did, not, print, descenders, there, was, a, period, during, the, early, home, computer, era, when, a, range, of, printers, were, manufactured, under, many, brands, such, as, the, commodore, vic, 1525, using, the, seikosha, uni, hammer, system, this, used, a, single, solenoid, with, an, oblique, striker, that, would, be, actuated, 7, times, for, each, column, of, 7, vertical, pixels, while, the, head, was, moving, at, a, constant, speed, the, angle, of, the, striker, would, align, the, dots, vertically, even, though, the, head, had, moved, one, dot, spacing, in, the, time, the, vertical, dot, position, was, controlled, by, a, synchronized, longitudinally, ribbed, platen, behind, the, paper, that, rotated, rapidly, with, a, rib, moving, vertically, seven, dot, spacings, in, the, time, it, took, to, print, one, pixel, column, 24, pin, print, heads, were, able, to, print, at, a, higher, quality, and, started, to, offer, additional, type, styles, and, were, marketed, as, near, letter, quality, by, some, vendors, once, the, price, of, inkjet, printers, dropped, to, the, point, where, they, were, competitive, with, dot, matrix, printers, dot, matrix, printers, began, to, fall, out, of, favour, for, general, use, some, dot, matrix, printers, such, as, the, nec, p6300, can, be, upgraded, to, print, in, color, this, is, achieved, through, the, use, of, a, four, color, ribbon, mounted, on, a, mechanism, provided, in, an, upgrade, kit, that, replaces, the, standard, black, ribbon, mechanism, after, installation, that, raises, and, lowers, the, ribbons, as, needed, color, graphics, are, generally, printed, in, four, passes, at, standard, resolution, thus, slowing, down, printing, considerably, as, a, result, color, graphics, can, take, up, to, four, times, longer, to, print, than, standard, monochrome, graphics, or, up, to, 8, 16, times, as, long, at, high, resolution, mode, dot, matrix, printers, are, still, commonly, used, in, low, cost, low, quality, applications, such, as, cash, registers, or, in, demanding, very, high, volume, applications, like, invoice, printing, impact, printing, unlike, laser, printing, allows, the, pressure, of, the, print, head, to, be, applied, to, a, stack, of, two, or, more, forms, to, print, multi, part, documents, such, as, sales, invoices, and, credit, card, receipts, using, continuous, stationery, with, carbonless, copy, paper, it, also, has, security, advantages, as, ink, impressed, into, a, paper, matrix, by, force, is, harder, to, erase, invisibly, dot, matrix, printers, were, being, superseded, even, as, receipt, printers, after, the, end, of, the, twentieth, century, line, printers, print, an, entire, line, of, text, at, a, time, four, principal, designs, exist, in, each, case, to, print, a, line, precisely, timed, hammers, strike, against, the, back, of, the, paper, at, the, exact, moment, that, the, correct, character, to, be, printed, is, passing, in, front, of, the, paper, the, paper, presses, forward, against, a, ribbon, which, then, presses, against, the, character, form, and, the, impression, of, the, character, form, is, printed, onto, the, paper, each, system, could, have, slight, timing, issues, which, could, cause, minor, misalignment, of, the, resulting, printed, characters, for, drum, or, typebar, printers, this, appeared, as, vertical, misalignment, with, characters, being, printed, slightly, above, or, below, the, rest, of, the, line, in, chain, or, bar, printers, the, misalignment, was, horizontal, with, printed, characters, being, crowded, closer, together, or, farther, apart, this, was, much, less, noticeable, to, human, vision, than, vertical, misalignment, where, characters, seemed, to, bounce, up, and, down, in, the, line, so, they, were, considered, as, higher, quality, print, line, printers, are, the, fastest, of, all, impact, printers, and, are, used, for, bulk, printing, in, large, computer, centres, a, line, printer, can, print, at, 1100, lines, per, minute, or, faster, frequently, printing, pages, more, rapidly, than, many, current, laser, printers, on, the, other, hand, the, mechanical, components, of, line, printers, operate, with, tight, tolerances, and, require, regular, preventive, maintenance, pm, to, produce, a, top, quality, print, they, are, virtually, never, used, with, personal, computers, and, have, now, been, replaced, by, high, speed, laser, printers, the, legacy, of, line, printers, lives, on, in, many, operating, systems, which, use, the, abbreviations, lp, lpr, or, lpt, to, refer, to, printers, liquid, ink, electrostatic, printers, use, a, chemical, coated, paper, which, is, charged, by, the, print, head, according, to, the, image, of, the, document, the, paper, is, passed, near, a, pool, of, liquid, ink, with, the, opposite, charge, the, charged, areas, of, the, paper, attract, the, ink, and, thus, form, the, image, this, process, was, developed, from, the, process, of, electrostatic, copying, color, reproduction, is, very, accurate, and, because, there, is, no, heating, the, scale, distortion, is, less, than, 0, 1, all, laser, printers, have, an, accuracy, of, 1, worldwide, most, survey, offices, used, this, printer, before, color, inkjet, plotters, become, popular, liquid, ink, electrostatic, printers, were, mostly, available, in, 36, to, 54, inches, 910, to, 1, 370, mm, width, and, also, 6, color, printing, these, were, also, used, to, print, large, billboards, it, was, first, introduced, by, versatec, which, was, later, bought, by, xerox, 3m, also, used, to, make, these, printers, pen, based, plotters, were, an, alternate, printing, technology, once, common, in, engineering, and, architectural, firms, pen, based, plotters, rely, on, contact, with, the, paper, but, not, impact, per, se, and, special, purpose, pens, that, are, mechanically, run, over, the, paper, to, create, text, and, images, since, the, pens, output, continuous, lines, they, were, able, to, produce, technical, drawings, of, higher, resolution, than, was, achievable, with, dot, matrix, technology, some, plotters, used, roll, fed, paper, and, therefore, had, a, minimal, restriction, on, the, size, of, the, output, in, one, dimension, these, plotters, were, capable, of, producing, quite, sizable, drawings, a, number, of, other, sorts, of, printers, are, important, for, historical, reasons, or, for, special, purpose, uses, printers, can, be, connected, to, computers, in, many, ways, directly, by, a, dedicated, data, cable, such, as, the, usb, through, a, short, range, radio, like, bluetooth, a, local, area, network, using, cables, such, as, the, ethernet, or, radio, such, as, wifi, or, on, a, standalone, basis, without, a, computer, using, a, memory, card, or, other, portable, data, storage, device, most, printers, other, than, line, printers, accept, control, characters, or, unique, character, sequences, to, control, various, printer, functions, these, may, range, from, shifting, from, lower, to, upper, case, or, from, black, to, red, ribbon, on, typewriter, printers, to, switching, fonts, and, changing, character, sizes, and, colors, on, raster, printers, early, printer, controls, were, not, standardized, with, each, manufacturer, s, equipment, having, its, own, set, the, ibm, personal, printer, data, stream, ppds, became, a, commonly, used, command, set, for, dot, matrix, printers, today, most, printers, accept, one, or, more, page, description, languages, pdls, laser, printers, with, greater, processing, power, frequently, offer, support, for, variants, of, hewlett, packard, s, printer, command, language, pcl, postscript, or, xml, paper, specification, most, inkjet, devices, support, manufacturer, proprietary, pdls, such, as, esc, p, the, diversity, in, mobile, platforms, have, led, to, various, standardization, efforts, around, device, pdls, such, as, the, printer, working, group, pwg, s, pwg, raster, the, speed, of, early, printers, was, measured, in, units, of, characters, per, minute, cpm, for, character, printers, or, lines, per, minute, lpm, for, line, printers, modern, printers, are, measured, in, pages, per, minute, ppm, these, measures, are, used, primarily, as, a, marketing, tool, and, are, not, as, well, standardised, as, toner, yields, usually, pages, per, minute, refers, to, sparse, monochrome, office, documents, rather, than, dense, pictures, which, usually, print, much, more, slowly, especially, color, images, speeds, in, ppm, usually, apply, to, a4, paper, in, most, countries, in, the, world, and, letter, paper, size, about, 6, shorter, in, north, america, the, data, received, by, a, printer, may, be, some, printers, can, process, all, four, types, of, data, others, not, today, it, is, possible, to, print, everything, even, plain, text, by, sending, ready, bitmapped, images, to, the, printer, this, allows, better, control, over, formatting, especially, among, machines, from, different, vendors, many, printer, drivers, do, not, use, the, text, mode, at, all, even, if, the, printer, is, capable, of, it, a, monochrome, printer, can, only, produce, monochrome, images, with, only, shades, of, a, single, color, most, printers, can, produce, only, two, colors, black, ink, and, white, no, ink, with, half, tonning, techniques, however, such, a, printer, can, produce, acceptable, grey, scale, images, too, a, color, printer, can, produce, images, of, multiple, colors, a, photo, printer, is, a, color, printer, that, can, produce, images, that, mimic, the, color, range, gamut, and, resolution, of, prints, made, from, photographic, film, the, page, yield, is, the, number, of, pages, that, can, be, printed, from, a, toner, cartridge, or, ink, cartridge, before, the, cartridge, needs, to, be, refilled, or, replaced, the, actual, number, of, pages, yielded, by, a, specific, cartridge, depends, on, a, number, of, factors, for, a, fair, comparison, many, laser, printer, manufacturers, use, the, iso, iec, 19752, process, to, measure, the, toner, cartridge, yield, in, order, to, fairly, compare, operating, expenses, of, printers, with, a, relatively, small, ink, cartridge, to, printers, with, a, larger, more, expensive, toner, cartridge, that, typically, holds, more, toner, and, so, prints, more, pages, before, the, cartridge, needs, to, be, replaced, many, people, prefer, to, estimate, operating, expenses, in, terms, of, cost, per, page, cpp, retailers, often, apply, the, razor, and, blades, model, a, company, may, sell, a, printer, at, cost, and, make, profits, on, the, ink, cartridge, paper, or, some, other, replacement, part, this, has, caused, legal, disputes, regarding, the, right, of, companies, other, than, the, printer, manufacturer, to, sell, compatible, ink, cartridges, to, protect, their, business, model, several, manufacturers, invest, heavily, in, developing, new, cartridge, technology, and, patenting, it, other, manufacturers, in, reaction, to, the, challenges, from, using, this, business, model, choose, to, make, more, money, on, printers, and, less, on, ink, promoting, the, latter, through, their, advertising, campaigns, finally, this, generates, two, clearly, different, proposals, cheap, printer, expensive, ink, or, expensive, printer, cheap, ink, ultimately, the, consumer, decision, depends, on, their, reference, interest, rate, or, their, time, preference, from, an, economics, viewpoint, there, is, a, clear, trade, off, between, cost, per, copy, and, cost, of, the, printer, printer, steganography, is, a, type, of, steganography, hiding, data, within, data, produced, by, color, printers, including, brother, canon, dell, epson, hp, ibm, konica, minolta, kyocera, lanier, lexmark, ricoh, toshiba, and, xerox, brand, color, laser, printers, where, tiny, yellow, dots, are, added, to, each, page, the, dots, are, barely, visible, and, contain, encoded, printer, serial, numbers, as, well, as, date, and, time, stamps, as, of, 2020, 2021, the, largest, worldwide, vendor, of, printers, is, hewlett, packard, followed, by, canon, brother, seiko, epson, and, kyocera, other, known, vendors, include, nec, ricoh, xerox, lexmark, oki,
