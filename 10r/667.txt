skiing, but, not, more, than, one, use, others, as, in, the, case, of, a, bridleway, in, the, uk, are, shared, use, and, can, be, used, by, pedestrians, cyclists, and, equestrians, alike, although, most, trails, are, for, low, traffic, non, motorized, usage, there, are, also, unpaved, trails, used, by, dirt, bikes, quad, bikes, and, other, off, road, vehicles, usually, for, extreme, sports, and, rally, races, in, some, places, like, the, alps, trails, are, used, by, alpine, agrarian, communities, for, moving, cattle, and, other, livestock, in, australia, the, term, track, can, be, used, interchangeably, with, trail, or, walk, and, can, refer, to, anything, from, a, dirt, road, to, an, unpaved, pedestrian, path, in, new, zealand, the, terms, track, or, walkway, are, used, almost, exclusively, except, when, referring, to, cross, country, skiing, walkways, vary, enormously, in, nature, from, short, urban, strolls, to, moderate, coastal, locations, to, challenging, tramps, in, the, high, country, walkway, is, used, similarly, in, st, john, s, newfoundland, canada, where, the, grand, concourse, is, an, integrated, walkway, system, in, the, united, kingdom, the, term, trail, is, in, common, usage, longer, distance, walking, routes, and, government, promoted, long, distance, paths, collectively, known, as, national, trails, are, also, frequently, called, ways, as, in, the, pennine, way, and, south, downs, way, generally, the, term, footpath, is, preferred, for, pedestrian, routes, including, long, distance, trails, and, is, used, for, urban, paths, and, sometimes, in, place, of, pavement, track, is, used, for, wider, paths, wide, enough, for, vehicles, often, used, for, hiking, the, terms, bridleway, byway, restricted, byway, are, all, recognised, legal, terms, and, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, in, general, usage, the, increased, popularity, of, mountain, biking, has, led, to, a, proliferation, of, mountain, bike, trails, in, many, countries, often, these, will, be, grouped, to, form, larger, complexes, known, as, trail, centers, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, the, term, auto, trail, was, used, for, a, marked, highway, route, and, trail, is, now, used, to, designate, routes, including, highway, routes, designated, for, tourist, interest, like, the, cabot, trail, nova, scotia, canada, and, the, quilt, trails, in, the, us, the, term, trail, has, been, used, by, developers, and, urban, planners, for, a, variety, of, modern, paved, roads, highways, and, boulevards, in, these, countries, and, some, highways, continue, to, be, officially, called, a, trail, such, as, the, susquehanna, trail, in, pennsylvania, a, designation, that, varies, from, a, two, lane, road, to, a, four, lane, freeway, an, unusual, use, of, the, term, is, in, the, canadian, province, of, alberta, which, has, multi, lane, freeways, called, trails, animals, created, the, first, trails, which, were, later, adapted, by, humans, subsequently, farmers, moved, cattle, to, market, along, drove, roads, and, between, winter, and, summer, grazing, creating, trails, more, recently, former, industrial, routes, such, as, railway, rights, of, way, and, canal, towpaths, have, been, turned, into, recreational, trails, many, historic, routes, like, the, silk, road, the, amber, road, and, the, royal, road, of, the, persian, empire, existed, before, the, christian, era, and, covered, great, distances, the, post, track, a, prehistoric, causeway, in, the, valley, of, the, river, brue, in, the, somerset, levels, england, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, constructed, trackways, and, dates, from, around, 3838, bc, the, idea, of, following, a, path, or, track, for, exercise, or, pleasure, developed, during, the, 18th, century, in, europe, and, arose, because, of, changing, attitudes, to, the, landscape, and, nature, associated, with, the, romantic, movement, in, earlier, times, walking, generally, indicated, poverty, and, was, associated, with, vagrancy, 83, 297, in, previous, centuries, long, walks, were, undertaken, as, part, of, religious, pilgrimages, and, this, tradition, continues, throughout, the, world, the, first, footpath, built, specifically, for, recreational, hiking, in, america, and, likely, the, world, is, the, crawford, path, in, the, white, mountains, of, new, hampshire, the, path, was, blazed, in, 1819, by, abel, crawford, and, his, son, ethan, allen, originally, 8, 25, miles, in, length, now, 8, 5, miles, the, trail, leads, to, the, summit, of, mt, washington, trails, can, be, located, in, different, settings, for, various, uses, these, can, include, trail, segregation, the, practice, of, designating, certain, trails, as, having, a, specific, preferred, or, exclusive, use, is, increasingly, common, and, diverse, for, example, bike, trails, are, used, not, only, on, roads, open, to, motor, vehicles, but, also, in, trail, systems, open, to, other, trail, users, some, trails, are, segregated, for, use, by, both, equestrians, and, mountain, bikes, or, by, equestrians, or, mountain, bikes, alone, designated, wilderness, area, trails, may, be, segregated, for, non, wheeled, use, permitting, backpacking, and, horses, but, not, permitting, mountain, bikes, and, motorized, vehicles, often, trail, segregation, for, a, particular, use, is, accompanied, by, prohibitions, against, that, use, on, other, trails, within, the, trail, system, trail, segregation, may, be, supported, by, signage, markings, trail, design, and, construction, especially, the, selection, of, tread, materials, and, by, separation, between, parallel, treads, separation, may, be, achieved, by, natural, barriers, including, distance, ditching, banking, grading, and, vegetation, and, by, artificial, barriers, including, fencing, curbing, and, walls, bicycle, trails, encompass, a, wide, variety, of, trail, types, including, shared, use, paths, used, for, commuting, off, road, cross, country, trails, and, downhill, mountain, bike, trails, the, number, of, off, road, cycle, trails, has, increased, significantly, along, with, the, popularity, of, mountain, bikes, off, road, bicycle, trails, are, generally, function, specific, and, most, commonly, waymarked, along, their, route, they, may, take, the, form, of, single, routes, or, form, part, of, larger, complexes, known, as, trail, centers, off, road, trails, often, incorporate, a, mix, of, challenging, terrain, singletrack, smooth, fireroads, and, even, paved, paths, trails, with, an, easy, or, moderate, technical, complexity, are, generally, deemed, cross, country, trails, while, trails, difficult, even, to, experienced, riders, are, more, often, dubbed, all, mountain, freeride, or, downhill, downhilling, is, popular, at, ski, resorts, like, mammoth, mountain, in, california, or, whistler, blackcomb, in, british, columbia, where, ski, lifts, are, used, to, get, bikes, and, riders, to, the, top, of, the, mountain, eurovelo, bicycle, routes, are, a, network, of, currently, 17, long, distance, cycling, routes, criss, crossing, europe, in, various, stages, of, completion, more, than, 90, 000, km, 55, 923, mi, was, in, place, by, 2020, eurovelo, is, a, project, of, the, european, cyclists, federation, ecf, eurovelo, routes, can, be, used, for, bicycle, touring, across, the, continent, and, by, local, people, making, short, journeys, the, routes, comprise, both, existing, national, bike, routes, such, as, the, dutch, lf, routes, the, german, d, routes, and, the, british, national, cycle, network, and, existing, general, purpose, roads, together, with, new, stretches, of, cycle, routes, to, connect, them, off, road, cycling, can, cause, soil, erosion, and, habitat, destruction, if, not, carried, out, on, established, trails, this, is, true, when, trails, are, wet, though, overall, cycling, may, not, have, more, of, an, impact, as, other, trail, users, in, cross, country, skiing, a, trail, is, also, called, a, track, or, piste, recreational, cross, country, skiing, is, also, called, touring, especially, in, europe, some, skiers, stay, out, for, extended, periods, using, tents, and, equipment, similar, to, bushwalkers, and, hikers, whereas, others, take, shorter, trips, from, ski, resorts, on, maintained, trails, in, some, countries, organizations, maintain, a, network, of, huts, for, use, by, cross, country, skiers, in, wintertime, for, example, the, norwegian, mountain, touring, association, maintains, over, 400, huts, stretching, across, hundreds, of, kilometres, of, trails, hikers, use, in, the, summer, and, skiers, use, in, the, winter, horse, riding, and, other, equestrian, uses, of, trails, continue, to, be, a, popular, activity, for, many, trail, users, horses, can, usually, negotiate, much, the, same, grades, as, hikers, but, not, always, although, they, can, more, easily, clear, obstacles, in, the, path, such, as, logs, the, bicentennial, national, trail, bnt, in, australia, is, one, of, the, longest, marked, multi, use, trail, in, the, world, stretching, 5, 330, km, 3, 312, mi, from, cooktown, queensland, through, new, south, wales, to, healesville, victoria, this, trail, runs, the, length, of, the, rugged, great, dividing, range, through, national, parks, private, property, and, alongside, of, wilderness, areas, one, of, the, objectives, was, to, develop, a, trail, that, linked, up, the, brumby, tracks, mustering, and, stock, routes, along, the, great, dividing, range, thus, providing, an, opportunity, to, legally, ride, the, routes, of, stockmen, and, drovers, who, once, travelled, these, areas, with, pack, horses, this, trail, provides, access, to, some, of, the, wildest, most, remote, country, in, the, world, the, bicentennial, national, trail, is, suitable, for, self, reliant, horse, riders, fit, walkers, and, mountain, bike, riders, within, the, united, states, national, trail, classification, system, equestrian, trails, include, simple, day, use, bridle, paths, and, others, built, to, accommodate, long, strings, of, pack, animals, on, journeys, lasting, many, days, trail, design, parameters, for, these, uses, include, trail, base, width, and, material, trail, clear, width, trail, clear, height, access, to, water, suitable, for, stock, not, human, use, and, trail, routing, a, footpath, is, a, type, of, thoroughfare, that, is, intended, for, use, only, by, pedestrians, either, within, an, urban, area, or, through, the, countryside, an, urban, footpath, is, usually, called, an, alley, or, lane, and, often, paved, see, also, sidewalk, and, pavement, other, public, rights, of, way, such, as, bridleways, byways, towpaths, and, green, lanes, are, also, used, by, pedestrians, in, england, and, wales, there, are, rights, of, way, on, which, pedestrians, have, a, legally, protected, right, to, travel, national, parks, nature, preserves, conservation, areas, and, other, protected, wilderness, areas, may, have, trails, that, are, restricted, to, pedestrians, footpaths, can, be, connected, to, form, a, long, distance, trail, or, way, which, can, be, used, by, both, day, hikers, and, backpackers, some, trails, are, over, 1, 000, miles, 1, 600, km, long, in, the, us, and, canada, where, urban, sprawl, has, reached, rural, communities, developers, and, local, leaders, are, currently, striving, to, make, their, communities, more, conducive, to, non, motorized, transportation, through, the, use, of, less, traditional, trails, the, robert, wood, johnson, foundation, in, the, us, has, established, the, active, living, by, design, program, to, improve, the, livability, of, communities, in, part, through, developing, trails, the, upper, valley, trails, alliance, in, vermont, has, done, similar, work, on, traditional, trails, while, the, somerville, community, path, in, somerville, massachusetts, and, related, paths, are, examples, of, urban, initiatives, in, st, john, s, newfoundland, canada, the, grand, concourse, is, an, integrated, walkway, system, that, has, over, 160, km, 99, mi, of, walkways, which, link, every, major, park, river, pond, and, green, space, in, six, municipalities, a, motorized, trail, is, a, trail, intended, for, off, road, vehicles, for, example, 4, 4, cars, dirt, bikes, all, terrain, vehicles, atv, motorized, trail, use, remains, very, popular, with, some, people, particularly, in, the, us, the, recreational, trails, program, defined, as, part, of, the, intermodal, surface, transportation, efficiency, act, of, 1991, mandates, that, states, must, use, a, minimum, of, 30, percent, of, these, funds, for, motorized, trail, uses, some, members, of, the, us, government, and, environmental, organizations, including, the, sierra, club, and, the, wilderness, society, have, criticized, off, road, vehicle, use, on, public, land, they, have, noted, several, consequences, of, illegal, orv, use, such, as, pollution, trail, damage, erosion, land, degradation, possible, species, extinction, and, habitat, destruction, which, can, leave, hiking, trails, impassable, orv, proponents, argue, legal, use, taking, place, under, planned, access, along, with, the, multiple, environmental, and, trail, conservation, efforts, by, orv, groups, will, mitigate, these, issues, groups, such, as, the, blueribbon, coalition, advocate, treadlightly, which, is, the, responsible, use, of, public, lands, used, for, off, road, activities, noise, pollution, is, also, a, concern, and, several, studies, conducted, by, montana, state, university, california, state, university, the, university, of, florida, and, others, have, cited, possible, negative, behavioral, changes, in, wildlife, as, the, result, of, some, orv, use, several, us, states, such, as, washington, have, laws, to, reduce, noise, generated, by, off, road, and, non, highway, vehicles, water, trails, also, referred, to, as, blueways, or, paddling, trails, are, marked, routes, on, navigable, waterways, such, as, rivers, lakes, canals, and, coastlines, for, people, using, small, non, motorized, boats, such, as, kayaks, canoes, rafts, or, rowboats, some, trails, may, be, suitable, for, float, tubing, or, developed, in, concert, with, motorized, use, they, include, signs, and, route, markers, maps, facilities, for, parking, boat, ramps, or, docks, and, places, to, camp, and, picnic, there, are, also, state, programs, and, other, promotion, for, water, trails, in, the, united, states, the, american, canoe, association, has, compiled, a, database, of, water, trails, in, the, united, states, the, national, park, service, rivers, trails, and, conservation, assistance, program, has, compiled, a, list, of, water, trail, resources, success, stories, and, statewide, contacts, for, water, trails, shared, use, may, be, achieved, by, sharing, a, trail, easement, but, maintaining, segregated, and, sometimes, also, separated, trail, treads, within, it, this, is, common, with, rail, trails, shared, use, may, also, refer, to, alternate, day, arrangements, whereby, two, uses, are, segregated, by, being, permitted, every, other, day, this, is, increasingly, common, on, long, distance, trails, shared, by, equestrians, and, mountain, bike, users, these, two, user, communities, have, similar, trail, requirements, but, may, experience, difficult, encounters, with, each, other, on, the, trail, the, trans, canada, trail, can, be, used, by, cyclists, hikers, horseback, riders, and, walkers, as, well, as, cross, country, skiers, snowmobilers, and, snowshoers, in, winter, in, the, united, states, the, east, coast, greenway, 3, 000, mi, 4, 828, km, from, key, west, to, the, canadian, border, and, the, 11, september, national,

railway, or, vicinal, tramway, lines, narrow, gauge, tramways, old, railway, lines, have, been, leased, by, the, walloon, government, for, 99, years, using, emphyteutic, lease, contracts, where, necessary, new, paths, are, created, to, link, parts, of, the, network, in, england, and, wales, a, bridleway, is, a, trail, intended, for, use, by, equestrians, but, walkers, also, have, a, right, of, way, and, section, 30, of, the, countryside, act, 1968, permits, the, riding, of, bicycles, but, not, motor, cycles, on, public, bridleways, though, the, act, says, it, shall, not, create, any, obligation, to, facilitate, the, use, of, the, bridleway, by, cyclists, thus, the, right, to, cycle, exists, even, though, it, may, be, difficult, to, exercise, on, occasion, especially, in, winter, cyclists, using, a, bridleway, must, give, way, to, other, users, on, foot, or, horseback, the, seawall, in, stanley, park, vancouver, british, columbia, canada, is, popular, for, walking, running, cycling, and, inline, skating, there, are, two, paths, one, for, skaters, and, cyclists, and, the, other, for, pedestrians, the, lane, for, cyclists, and, skaters, goes, one, way, in, a, counterclockwise, loop, foreshoreway, also, oceanway, is, a, term, used, in, australia, for, a, type, of, greenway, that, provides, a, public, right, of, way, along, the, edge, of, the, sea, open, to, both, walkers, and, cyclists, a, forest, road, is, a, type, of, rudimentary, access, road, built, mainly, for, the, forest, industry, in, some, cases, they, are, used, for, backcountry, recreation, access, there, is, open, access, to, most, forestry, commission, roads, and, land, in, great, britain, for, walkers, cyclists, and, horse, riders, and, since, the, countryside, bill, of, 1968, it, has, become, the, largest, provider, of, outdoor, recreation, in, britain, the, commission, works, with, associations, involved, in, rambling, cycling, mountain, biking, and, horse, riding, to, promote, the, use, of, its, land, for, recreation, the, trails, open, to, the, public, are, not, just, forest, roads, a, notable, example, of, the, commission, s, promotion, of, outdoor, activity, is, the, 7stanes, project, in, scotland, where, seven, purpose, built, areas, of, mountain, bike, trails, have, been, laid, including, facilities, for, disabled, cyclists, a, holloway, also, hollow, way, is, a, sunken, path, or, lane, i, e, a, road, or, track, that, is, significantly, lower, than, the, land, on, either, side, not, formed, by, the, recent, engineering, of, a, road, cutting, but, possibly, of, much, greater, age, various, mechanisms, have, been, proposed, for, how, holloways, may, have, been, formed, including, erosion, by, water, or, traffic, the, digging, of, embankments, to, assist, with, the, herding, of, livestock, and, the, digging, of, double, banks, to, mark, the, boundaries, of, estates, these, mechanisms, are, all, possible, and, could, apply, in, different, cases, rail, trails, or, paths, are, shared, use, paths, that, take, advantage, of, abandoned, railway, corridors, they, can, be, used, for, walking, cycling, and, horseback, riding, they, exist, throughout, the, world, railtrails, australia, describes, them, as, following, the, route, of, the, railways, they, cut, through, hills, under, roads, over, embankments, and, across, gullies, and, creeks, apart, from, being, great, places, to, walk, cycle, or, horse, ride, rail, trails, are, linear, conservation, corridors, protecting, native, plants, and, animals, they, often, link, remnant, vegetation, in, farming, areas, and, contain, valuable, flora, and, fauna, habitat, wineries, and, other, attractions, are, near, many, trails, as, well, as, b, b, s, and, other, great, places, to, stay, most, trails, have, a, gravel, or, dirt, surface, suitable, for, walking, mountain, bikes, and, horses, in, the, usa, the, 42, mi, 68, km, cheshire, rail, trail, in, new, hampshire, can, be, used, by, hikers, horseback, riders, snowmobilers, cross, country, skiers, cyclists, and, even, dogsledders, in, canada, following, the, abandonment, of, the, prince, edward, island, railway, in, 1989, the, government, of, prince, edward, island, purchased, the, right, of, way, to, the, entire, railway, system, the, confederation, trail, was, developed, as, a, tip, to, tip, walking, cycling, gravel, rail, trail, which, doubles, as, a, monitored, and, groomed, snowmobile, trail, during, the, winter, months, operated, by, the, pei, snowmobile, association, a, considerable, part, of, the, trans, canada, trail, is, repurposed, defunct, rail, lines, donated, to, provincial, governments, by, the, canadian, pacific, and, canadian, national, railways, rebuilt, as, walking, trails, much, of, the, trans, canada, trail, development, emulated, the, successful, rails, to, trails, initiative, in, the, united, states, the, trail, is, multi, use, and, depending, on, the, section, may, allow, hikers, bicyclists, horseback, riders, cross, country, skiers, and, snowmobilers, a, towpath, is, a, road, or, path, on, the, bank, of, a, river, canal, or, other, inland, waterway, the, original, purpose, of, a, towpath, was, to, allow, a, horse, or, a, team, of, human, pullers, to, tow, a, boat, often, a, barge, they, can, be, paved, or, unpaved, and, are, popular, with, cyclists, and, walkers, some, are, suitable, for, equestrians, equestrians, have, legal, access, to, all, towpaths, in, scotland, and, there, is, a, campaign, for, similar, rights, in, england, and, wales, in, snowy, winters, in, the, usa, they, are, popular, with, cross, country, skiers, and, snowmobile, users, most, canals, were, owned, by, private, companies, in, britain, and, the, towpaths, were, deemed, to, be, private, for, the, benefit, of, legitimate, users, of, the, canal, the, nationalisation, of, the, canal, system, in, 1948, did, not, result, in, the, towpaths, becoming, public, rights, of, way, and, subsequent, legislation, such, as, the, transport, act, of, 1968, which, defined, the, government, s, obligations, to, the, maintenance, of, the, inland, waterways, for, which, it, was, now, responsible, did, not, include, any, commitment, to, maintain, towpaths, for, use, by, anyone, ten, years, later, british, waterways, started, to, relax, the, rule, that, a, permit, was, required, to, give, access, to, a, towpath, and, began, to, encourage, leisure, usage, by, walkers, anglers, and, in, some, areas, cyclists, the, british, waterways, act, 1995, still, did, not, enshrine, any, right, of, public, access, although, it, did, encourage, recreational, access, of, all, kinds, to, the, network, although, the, steady, development, of, the, leisure, use, of, the, canals, and, the, decline, of, commercial, traffic, had, resulted, in, a, general, acceptance, that, towpaths, are, open, to, everyone, and, not, just, boat, users, the, concept, of, free, access, to, towpaths, is, enshrined, in, the, legislation, which, transferred, responsibility, for, the, english, and, welsh, canals, from, british, waterways, to, the, canal, river, trust, in, 2012, not, all, towpaths, are, suitable, for, use, by, cyclists, but, where, they, are, and, the, canal, is, owned, by, british, waterways, a, permit, is, required, there, is, no, charge, for, a, permit, but, it, acts, as, an, opportunity, to, inform, cyclists, about, safe, and, unsafe, areas, to, cycle, some, areas, including, london, are, exempt, from, this, policy, but, are, covered, instead, by, the, london, towpath, code, of, conduct, and, cyclists, must, have, a, bell, which, they, ring, twice, when, approaching, pedestrians, parts, of, some, towpaths, have, been, incorporated, into, the, national, cycle, network, and, in, most, cases, this, has, resulted, in, the, surface, being, improved, in, france, it, is, possible, to, cycle, rollerblade, and, hike, along, the, banks, of, the, canal, du, midi, a, paved, stretch, of, 50, km, 31, mi, from, toulouse, to, avignonet, lauragais, and, another, 12, km, 7, 5, mi, between, b, ziers, and, portiragnes, are, particularly, suited, to, cycling, and, rollerblading, it, is, possible, to, cycle, or, walk, the, entire, canal, des, deux, mers, from, s, te, to, bordeaux, other, french, canals, provide, walkers, with, many, excellent, routes, as, they, are, always, accompanied, by, a, towpath, which, makes, a, pleasant, off, road, track, and, have, the, added, virtues, of, flatness, shade, and, an, abundance, of, villages, along, the, way, though, walking, a, canal, can, be, monotonous, so, that, a, long, trip, beside, a, canal, is, better, done, by, bicycle, an, urban, trail, is, a, citywide, network, of, non, motorized, multi, use, pathways, that, are, used, by, bicyclists, walkers, and, runners, for, both, transportation, and, recreation, urban, trails, average, ten, foot, in, width, and, are, surfaced, with,

public, transport, stops, urban, pedestrian, footpaths, are, sometimes, called, alleys, or, lanes, and, in, older, cities, and, towns, in, europe, and, are, often, what, is, left, of, a, medieval, street, network, or, rights, of, way, or, ancient, footpaths, similar, paths, also, exist, in, some, older, north, american, towns, and, cities, like, charleston, south, carolina, new, castle, delaware, and, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, such, urban, trails, or, footpaths, are, narrow, usually, paved, and, often, between, the, walls, of, buildings, this, type, is, usually, short, and, straight, and, on, steep, ground, can, consist, partially, or, entirely, of, steps, some, are, named, because, of, geography, steps, are, a, common, form, of, footpath, in, hilly, cities, and, towns, this, includes, pittsburgh, see, steps, of, pittsburgh, cincinnati, see, steps, of, cincinnati, seattle, and, san, francisco, in, the, united, states, as, well, as, hong, kong, quebec, city, quebec, canada,

one, point, to, another, without, connecting, trails, these, trails, are, also, known, as, out, and, back, or, destination, trails, rail, trails, and, long, distance, trails, are, examples, of, linear, trails, linear, trails, usually, follow, long, distances, a, shorter, linear, trail, is, a, spur, trail, which, takes, a, user, to, a, particular, point, of, interest, such, as, a, waterfall, or, mountain, summit, a, looped, trail, allows, a, user, to, end, up, where, they, started, with, either, minimal, or, no, repeating, parts, of, the, trail, looped, trail, systems, come, in, many, permutations, a, single, looped, trail, system, is, often, used, around, lakes, wetlands, and, other, geological, features, a, series, of, looped, trails, is, a, stacked, loop, trail, system, a, stacked, loop, trail, system, has, several, interconnected, looped, trails, this, creates, an, efficient, compact, design, with, many, route, options, in, a, multiple, loop, system, each, loop, extends, from, a, single, trailhead, trail, systems, often, combine, linear, trails, with, looped, trails, in, a, spoked, wheel, system, linear, trails, connect, a, central, trailhead, with, an,

wales, usually, county, councils, or, unitary, authorities, are, required, to, maintain, the, definitive, map, of, all, public, rights, of, way, in, their, areas, and, these, can, be, inspected, at, council, offices, if, a, path, is, shown, on, the, definitive, map, and, no, subsequent, order, e, g, a, stopping, up, exists, then, the, right, of, way, is, conclusive, in, law, but, just, because, a, path, is, not, on, that, map, does, not, mean, that, it, is, not, a, public, path, as, the, rights, may, not, have, been, recorded, the, countryside, agency, estimated, that, over, 10, of, public, paths, are, not, yet, listed, on, the, definitive, map, the, countryside, and, rights, of, way, act, 2000, provides, that, paths, that, are, not, recorded, on, the, definitive, map, by, 2026, and, that, were, in, use, prior, to, 1949, will, automatically, be, deemed, stopped, up, on, 1, january, 2026, in, scotland, a, right, of, way, is, a, route, over, which, the, public, has, passed, unhindered, for, at, least, 20, years, the, route, must, link, two, public, places, such, as, villages, churches, or, roads, unlike, in, england, and, wales, there, is, no, obligation, on, scottish,

distinction, between, footpaths, and, bridleways, in, scotland, as, there, is, in, england, and, wales, though, it, is, generally, accepted, that, cyclists, and, horseback, riders, may, follow, rights, of, way, with, suitable, surfaces, the, land, reform, scotland, act, 2003, established, a, general, presumption, of, access, to, all, land, in, scotland, making, the, existence, of, rights, of, way, less, important, in, terms, of, access, to, land, in, scotland, certain, categories, of, land, are, excluded, from, this, presumption, of, open, access, such, as, railway, land, airfields, and, private, gardens, northern, ireland, has, very, few, public, rights, of, way, and, access, to, land, there, is, more, restricted, than, other, parts, of, the, uk, in, many, areas, walkers, can, enjoy, the, countryside, only, because, of, the, goodwill, and, tolerance, of, landowners, northern, ireland, shares, the, same, legal, system, as, england, including, concepts, about, the, ownership, of, land, and, public, rights, of, way, but, it, has, its, own, court, structure, system, of, precedents, and, specific, access, legislation, in, england, and, wales, a, national, trails, system, of, long, distance, footpaths, also, exists, administered, by, natural, england, and, the, natural, resources, wales, statutory, agencies, of, the, uk, and, the, welsh, governments, respectively, these, include, hadrian, s, wall, path, the, pembrokeshire, coast, path, the, pennine, bridleway, bridleway, the, south, west, coast, path, south, west, way, the, longest, and, the, thames, path, and, many,

the, public, this, publication, discusses, ways, to, manage, access, by, these, vehicles, there, are, many, types, of, non, motorized, land, based, recreational, trails, and, shared, use, paths, hiker, and, pedestrian, trails, mountain, biking, trails, equestrian, trails, and, multi, use, trails, designed, for, several, user, types, the, companion, guide, to, this, publication, the, 2013, pennsylvania, trail, design, and, development, principles, guidelines, for, sustainable, non, motorized, trails, the, pennsylvania, trail, design, manual, provides, guidance, and, detailed, information, about, the, characteristics, of, the, various, types, of, trails, and, paths, the, publication, is, a, resource, to, help, evaluate, plan, design, construct, and, manage, a, route, on, a, site, the, publication, universal, access, trails, and, shared, use, paths, design, management, ethical, and, legal, considerations, focuses, on, the, accessibility, aspects, of, the, most, commonly, constructed, types, while, most, trails, have, arisen, through, common, usage, the, design, and, construction, of, good, quality, new, paths, is, a, complex, process, that, requires, certain, skills, when, a, trail, passes, across, a, flat, area, that, is, not, wet, brush, tree, limbs, and, undergrowth, are, removed, to, create, a, clear, walkable, trail, a, bridge, is, built, when, a, stream, or, river, is, sufficiently, deep, to, make, it, necessary, other, options, are, culverts, stepping, stones, and, shallow, fords, for, equestrian, use, shallow, fords, may, be, preferred, in, wet, areas, an, elevated, trailway, with, fill, or, a, boardwalk, is, often, used, though, boardwalks, require, frequent, maintenance, and, replacement, because, boards, in, poor, condition, can, become, slippery, and, hazardous, trail, gradients, are, determined, based, on, a, site, specific, assessment, of, soils, and, geology, drainage, patterns, of, the, slope, surrounding, vegetation, types, position, on, the, slope, of, a, given, trail, segment, bottom, mid, slope, ridgeline, average, precipitation, storm, intensities, types, of, use, volume, and, intensity, of, use, and, a, host, of, other, factors, affecting, the, ability, of, the, trail, substrate, to, resist, erosion, and, provide, a, navigable, surface, trails, that, ascend, steep, slopes, may, use, switchbacks, but, switchback, design, and, construction, is, a, specialized, topic, trails, that, are, accessible, by, users, with, disabilities, are, mandated, by, the, u, s, federal, government, to, have, slope, of, less, than, 12, with, no, more, than, 30, of, the, trail, having, slope, greater, than, 8, 33, trails, outside, of, wilderness, areas, have, outward, side, to, side, gradients, less, than, 8, a, flat, or, inward, sloping, trail, collects, water, and, causes, extra, trail, maintenance, the, ideal, path, is, built, almost, but, not, quite, level, in, cross, section, to, achieve, a, proper, slope, in, hilly, terrain, a, sidehill, trail, is, excavated, this, type, of, trailway, is, created, by, establishing, a, line, of, a, suitable, slope, across, a, hillside, which, is, then, dug, out, by, means, of, a, mattock, or, similar, tool, this, may, be, a, full, bench, trail, where, the, treadway, is, only, on, the, firm, ground, surface, after, the, overlying, soil, is, removed, and, sidecast, thrown, to, the, side, as, waste, or, a, half, bench, trail, where, soil, is, removed, and, packed, to, the, side, so, that, the, treadway, is, half, on, firm, old, ground, and, half, on, new, packed, fill, in, areas, near, drainages, creeks, and, other, waterways, excavation, spoils, are, taken, away, in, bulk, and, deposited, in, an, environmentally, benign, area, trails, are, established, entirely, on, fill, in, problem, areas, in, such, cases, the, soil, is, packed, down, firmly, and, the, site, is, periodically, checked, to, maintain, the, stability, of, the, trail, cycle, trails, built, for, commuting, may, be, built, to, a, different, set, of, standards, than, pedestrian, only, trails, and, in, some, cases, may, require, a, harder, surface, fewer, changes, in, grade, and, slope, increased, sight, visibility, and, fewer, sharp, changes, in, direction, on, the, other, hand, the, cross, slope, of, a, bicycle, trail, may, be, significantly, greater, than, a, foot, trail, and, the, path, may, be, narrower, in, some, cases, the, american, association, of, state, highway, and, transportation, officials, recommends, different, widths, for, different, types, of, bicycle, facilities, for, example, a, shared, use, path, has, a, recommended, one, directional, width, of, 8, feet, 2, 44, m, while, a, bidirectional, path, should, be, significantly, wider, 10, to, 12, feet, or, 3, 05, to, 3, 66, metres, to, accommodate, bidirectional, traffic, and, users, the, us, department, of, transportation, provides, additional, guidance, on, recreational, bicycle, and, pedestrian, trail, planning, and, design, standards, a, well, designed, recreational, mountain, bike, path, for, the, exclusive, use, of, bicycles, has, an, average, grade, of, less, than, 10, and, generally, follows, a, contour, line, rather, than, straight, downhill, trail, construction, requires, proper, drainage, if, drainage, is, inadequate, three, issues, may, occur, water, may, accumulate, on, flat, terrain, to, the, point, that, the, trail, becomes, unusable, moving, water, can, erode, trails, on, slopes, or, inadequate, drainage, may, create, local, mud, spots, mountain, bike, trails, slope, out, or, across, the, trail, 3, 5, downhill, to, encourage, water, to, run, off, the, side, rather, than, down, the, trail, bed, to, remedy, the, first, problem, water, accumulation, on, flat, terrain, raised, walkways, are, often, built, they, include, turnpikes, causeways, embankments, stepping, stones, and, bridges, or, deckwalks, the, earthen, approaches, are, often, done, by, cutting, poles, from, the, woods, staking, parallel, poles, in, place, on, the, ground, then, filling, between, them, with, whatever, material, is, available, to, create, the, raised, walkway, the, more, elaborate, option, of, the, deckwalk, is, by, necessity, reserved, for, shorter, stretches, in, very, high, traffic, areas, water, accumulation, is, particularly, common, in, the, north, country, of, england, the, second, problem, water, erosion, is, caused, because, trails, by, their, nature, tend, to, become, drainage, channels, and, eventually, gullies, when, the, drainage, is, poorly, controlled, where, a, trail, is, near, the, top, of, a, hill, or, ridge, this, is, usually, a, minor, issue, but, when, it, is, farther, down, it, can, become, a, very, major, one, in, areas, of, heavy, water, flow, along, a, trail, a, ditch, is, often, dug, on, the, uphill, side, of, the, trail, with, drainage, points, across, the, trail, the, cross, drainage, is, also, accomplished, by, means, of, culverts, cleared, on, a, semi, annual, basis, or, by, means, of, cross, channels, often, created, by, placing, logs, or, timbers, across, the, trail, in, a, downhill, direction, called, thank, you, marms, deadmen, or, waterbars, timbers, or, rocks, are, also, used, for, this, purpose, to, create, erosion, barriers, rock, paving, in, the, bottom, of, these, channels, and, in, the, trailside, ditches, is, sometimes, used, to, maintain, stability, the, creation, of, water, bars, with, or, without, ditching, at, major, points, of, water, flow, on, or, along, the, trail, and, in, conjunction, with, existing, drainage, channels, below, the, trail, is, a, technique, that, can, be, applied, another, technique, that, has, been, adopted, is, the, construction, of, coweeta, dips, or, drain, dips, points, on, the, trail, where, it, falls, briefly, for, a, meter, or, so, and, then, rises, again, these, provide, positive, drainage, points, that, are, almost, never, clogged, by, debris, the, third, type, of, problem, can, occur, both, on, bottomlands, and, on, ridgetops, and, a, variety, of, other, spots, a, local, spot, or, short, stretch, of, the, trail, may, be, chronically, wet, if, the, trail, is, not, directly, on, rock, then, a, mud, pit, forms, trail, users, go, to, the, side, of, the, trail, to, avoid, the, mud, pit, and, the, trail, becomes, widened, a, corduroy, is, a, technique, used, when, an, area, cannot, be, drained, this, ranges, from, random, sticks, to, split, logs, being, laid, across, the, path, some, early, turnpikes, in, the, united, states, were, corduroy, roads, and, these, can, still, be, found, in, third, world, forested, areas, with, recreational, trails, it, is, common, for, the, sticks, to, be, one, to, three, inches, thick, and, laid, in, place, close, together, sometimes, a, short, bridge, is, used, natural, surface, single, track, trails, will, require, some, ongoing, maintenance, if, the, trail, is, properly, designed, and, constructed, maintenance, should, be, limited, to, clearing, downed, trees, trimming, back, brush, and, clearing, drainages, depending, on, location, if, the, trail, is, properly, designed, there, should, be, no, need, for, major, rework, such, as, grading, or, erosion, control, efforts, mountain, trails, which, see, both, significant, rainfall, and, human, traffic, may, require, trail, hardening, efforts, to, prevent, further, erosion, most, of, the, seemingly, natural, rock, steps, on, the, mountain, trails, of, the, northeast, united, states, are, the, work, of, professional, and, volunteer, trail, crews, for, long, distance, trails, or, trails, where, there, is, any, possibility, of, someone, taking, a, wrong, turn, blazing, or, signage, is, provided, the, term, waymarking, is, used, in, britain, this, is, accomplished, by, using, either, paint, on, natural, surfaces, or, by, placing, pre, made, medallions, or, sometimes, cairns, horseshoe, shaped, blazes, are, used, frequently, for, bridle, trails, the, appalachian, trail, is, blazed, with, white, rectangles, and, blue, is, often, used, for, side, trails, european, long, distance, walking, paths, are, blazed, with, yellow, points, encircled, with, red, other, walking, paths, in, european, countries, are, blazed, in, a, variety, of, manners, where, bike, trails, intersect, with, pedestrian, or, equestrian, trails, signage, at, the, intersections, and, high, visibility, onto, the, intersecting, trails, are, needed, to, prevent, collisions, between, fast, moving, cyclists, and, slower, moving, hikers, and, horses, bicycles, and, horses, can, share, the, same, trails, where, the, trail, is, wide, enough, with, good, visibility, the, us, department, of, transportation, provides, standards, and, guidelines, for, traffic, control, including, signage, and, striping, for, bicycle, facilities, a, simple, colored, symbol, to, classify, a, trail, s, difficulty, in, the, usa, was, first, used, for, ski, trails, and, is, now, being, used, for, hiking, bicycle, other, trails, other, systems, may, be, used, in, different, locations, in, switzerland, paths, are, classified, by, three, levels, of, difficulties, hiking, paths, yellow, markers, mountain, paths, white, red, white, markers, and, alpine, paths, white, blue, white, markers
