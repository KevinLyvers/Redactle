a, computer, network, is, a, set, of, computers, sharing, resources, located, on, or, provided, by, network, nodes, computers, use, common, communication, protocols, over, digital, interconnections, to, communicate, with, each, other, these, interconnections, are, made, up, of, telecommunication, network, technologies, based, on, physically, wired, optical, and, wireless, radio, frequency, methods, that, may, be, arranged, in, a, variety, of, network, topologies, the, nodes, of, a, computer, network, can, include, personal, computers, servers, networking, hardware, or, other, specialized, or, general, purpose, hosts, they, are, identified, by, network, addresses, and, may, have, hostnames, hostnames, serve, as, memorable, labels, for, the, nodes, and, are, rarely, changed, after, initial, assignment, network, addresses, serve, for, locating, and, identifying, the, nodes, by, communication, protocols, such, as, the, internet, protocol, computer, networks, may, be, classified, by, many, criteria, including, the, transmission, medium, used, to, carry, signals, bandwidth, communications, protocols, to, organize, network, traffic, the, network, size, the, topology, traffic, control, mechanisms, and, organizational, intent, computer, networks, support, many, applications, and, services, such, as, access, to, the, world, wide, web, digital, video, and, audio, shared, use, of, application, and, storage, servers, printers, and, fax, machines, and, use, of, email, and, instant, messaging, applications, computer, networking, may, be, considered, a, branch, of, computer, science, computer, engineering, and, telecommunications, since, it, relies, on, the, theoretical, and, practical, application, of, the, related, disciplines, computer, networking, was, influenced, by, a, wide, array, of, technological, developments, and, historical, milestones, computer, networks, enhance, how, users, communicate, with, each, other, by, using, various, electronic, methods, like, email, instant, messaging, online, chat, voice, and, video, calls, and, video, conferencing, networks, also, enable, the, sharing, of, computing, resources, for, example, a, user, can, print, a, document, on, a, shared, printer, or, use, shared, storage, devices, additionally, networks, allow, for, the, sharing, of, files, and, information, giving, authorized, users, access, to, data, stored, on, other, computers, distributed, computing, leverages, resources, from, multiple, computers, across, a, network, to, perform, tasks, collaboratively, most, modern, computer, networks, use, protocols, based, on, packet, mode, transmission, a, network, packet, is, a, formatted, unit, of, data, carried, by, a, packet, switched, network, packets, consist, of, two, types, of, data, control, information, and, user, data, payload, the, control, information, provides, data, the, network, needs, to, deliver, the, user, data, for, example, source, and, destination, network, addresses, error, detection, codes, and, sequencing, information, typically, control, information, is, found, in, packet, headers, and, trailers, with, payload, data, in, between, with, packets, the, bandwidth, of, the, transmission, medium, can, be, better, shared, among, users, than, if, the, network, were, circuit, switched, when, one, user, is, not, sending, packets, the, link, can, be, filled, with, packets, from, other, users, and, so, the, cost, can, be, shared, with, relatively, little, interference, provided, the, link, is, not, overused, often, the, route, a, packet, needs, to, take, through, a, network, is, not, immediately, available, in, that, case, the, packet, is, queued, and, waits, until, a, link, is, free, the, physical, link, technologies, of, packet, networks, typically, limit, the, size, of, packets, to, a, certain, maximum, transmission, unit, mtu, a, longer, message, may, be, fragmented, before, it, is, transferred, and, once, the, packets, arrive, they, are, reassembled, to, construct, the, original, message, the, physical, or, geographic, locations, of, network, nodes, and, links, generally, have, relatively, little, effect, on, a, network, but, the, topology, of, interconnections, of, a, network, can, significantly, affect, its, throughput, and, reliability, with, many, technologies, such, as, bus, or, star, networks, a, single, failure, can, cause, the, network, to, fail, entirely, in, general, the, more, interconnections, there, are, the, more, robust, the, network, is, but, the, more, expensive, it, is, to, install, therefore, most, network, diagrams, are, arranged, by, their, network, topology, which, is, the, map, of, logical, interconnections, of, network, hosts, common, topologies, are, the, physical, layout, of, the, nodes, in, a, network, may, not, necessarily, reflect, the, network, topology, as, an, example, with, fddi, the, network, topology, is, a, ring, but, the, physical, topology, is, often, a, star, because, all, neighboring, connections, can, be, routed, via, a, central, physical, location, physical, layout, is, not, completely, irrelevant, however, as, common, ducting, and, equipment, locations, can, represent, single, points, of, failure, due, to, issues, like, fires, power, failures, and, flooding, an, overlay, network, is, a, virtual, network, that, is, built, on, top, of, another, network, nodes, in, the, overlay, network, are, connected, by, virtual, or, logical, links, each, link, corresponds, to, a, path, perhaps, through, many, physical, links, in, the, underlying, network, the, topology, of, the, overlay, network, may, and, often, does, differ, from, that, of, the, underlying, one, for, example, many, peer, to, peer, networks, are, overlay, networks, they, are, organized, as, nodes, of, a, virtual, system, of, links, that, run, on, top, of, the, internet, overlay, networks, have, been, used, since, the, early, days, of, networking, back, when, computers, were, connected, via, telephone, lines, using, modems, even, before, data, networks, were, developed, the, most, striking, example, of, an, overlay, network, is, the, internet, itself, the, internet, itself, was, initially, built, as, an, overlay, on, the, telephone, network, even, today, each, internet, node, can, communicate, with, virtually, any, other, through, an, underlying, mesh, of, sub, networks, of, wildly, different, topologies, and, technologies, address, resolution, and, routing, are, the, means, that, allow, mapping, of, a, fully, connected, ip, overlay, network, to, its, underlying, network, another, example, of, an, overlay, network, is, a, distributed, hash, table, which, maps, keys, to, nodes, in, the, network, in, this, case, the, underlying, network, is, an, ip, network, and, the, overlay, network, is, a, table, actually, a, map, indexed, by, keys, overlay, networks, have, also, been, proposed, as, a, way, to, improve, internet, routing, such, as, through, quality, of, service, guarantees, achieve, higher, quality, streaming, media, previous, proposals, such, as, intserv, diffserv, and, ip, multicast, have, not, seen, wide, acceptance, largely, because, they, require, modification, of, all, routers, in, the, network, on, the, other, hand, an, overlay, network, can, be, incrementally, deployed, on, end, hosts, running, the, overlay, protocol, software, without, cooperation, from, internet, service, providers, the, overlay, network, has, no, control, over, how, packets, are, routed, in, the, underlying, network, between, two, overlay, nodes, but, it, can, control, for, example, the, sequence, of, overlay, nodes, that, a, message, traverses, before, it, reaches, its, destination, for, example, akamai, technologies, manages, an, overlay, network, that, provides, reliable, efficient, content, delivery, a, kind, of, multicast, academic, research, includes, end, system, multicast, resilient, routing, and, quality, of, service, studies, among, others, the, transmission, media, often, referred, to, in, the, literature, as, the, physical, medium, used, to, link, devices, to, form, a, computer, network, include, electrical, cable, optical, fiber, and, free, space, in, the, osi, model, the, software, to, handle, the, media, is, defined, at, layers, 1, and, 2, the, physical, layer, and, the, data, link, layer, a, widely, adopted, family, that, uses, copper, and, fiber, media, in, local, area, network, lan, technology, are, collectively, known, as, ethernet, the, media, and, protocol, standards, that, enable, communication, between, networked, devices, over, ethernet, are, defined, by, ieee, 802, 3, wireless, lan, standards, use, radio, waves, others, use, infrared, signals, as, a, transmission, medium, power, line, communication, uses, a, building, s, power, cabling, to, transmit, data, the, following, classes, of, wired, technologies, are, used, in, computer, networking, network, connections, can, be, established, wirelessly, using, radio, or, other, electromagnetic, means, of, communication, the, last, two, cases, have, a, large, round, trip, delay, time, which, gives, slow, two, way, communication, but, does, not, prevent, sending, large, amounts, of, information, they, can, have, high, throughput, apart, from, any, physical, transmission, media, networks, are, built, from, additional, basic, system, building, blocks, such, as, network, interface, controllers, repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers, modems, and, firewalls, any, particular, piece, of, equipment, will, frequently, contain, multiple, building, blocks, and, so, may, perform, multiple, functions, a, network, interface, controller, nic, is, computer, hardware, that, connects, the, computer, to, the, network, media, and, has, the, ability, to, process, low, level, network, information, for, example, the, nic, may, have, a, connector, for, plugging, in, a, cable, or, an, aerial, for, wireless, transmission, and, reception, and, the, associated, circuitry, in, ethernet, networks, each, nic, has, a, unique, media, access, control, mac, address, usually, stored, in, the, controller, s, permanent, memory, to, avoid, address, conflicts, between, network, devices, the, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, maintains, and, administers, mac, address, uniqueness, the, size, of, an, ethernet, mac, address, is, six, octets, the, three, most, significant, octets, are, reserved, to, identify, nic, manufacturers, these, manufacturers, using, only, their, assigned, prefixes, uniquely, assign, the, three, least, significant, octets, of, every, ethernet, interface, they, produce, a, repeater, is, an, electronic, device, that, receives, a, network, signal, cleans, it, of, unnecessary, noise, and, regenerates, it, the, signal, is, retransmitted, at, a, higher, power, level, or, to, the, other, side, of, obstruction, so, that, the, signal, can, cover, longer, distances, without, degradation, in, most, twisted, pair, ethernet, configurations, repeaters, are, required, for, cable, that, runs, longer, than, 100, meters, with, fiber, optics, repeaters, can, be, tens, or, even, hundreds, of, kilometers, apart, repeaters, work, on, the, physical, layer, of, the, osi, model, but, still, require, a, small, amount, of, time, to, regenerate, the, signal, this, can, cause, a, propagation, delay, that, affects, network, performance, and, may, affect, proper, function, as, a, result, many, network, architectures, limit, the, number, of, repeaters, used, in, a, network, e, g, the, ethernet, 5, 4, 3, rule, an, ethernet, repeater, with, multiple, ports, is, known, as, an, ethernet, hub, in, addition, to, reconditioning, and, distributing, network, signals, a, repeater, hub, assists, with, collision, detection, and, fault, isolation, for, the, network, hubs, and, repeaters, in, lans, have, been, largely, obsoleted, by, modern, network, switches, network, bridges, and, network, switches, are, distinct, from, a, hub, in, that, they, only, forward, frames, to, the, ports, involved, in, the, communication, whereas, a, hub, forwards, to, all, ports, bridges, only, have, two, ports, but, a, switch, can, be, thought, of, as, a, multi, port, bridge, switches, normally, have, numerous, ports, facilitating, a, star, topology, for, devices, and, for, cascading, additional, switches, bridges, and, switches, operate, at, the, data, link, layer, layer, 2, of, the, osi, model, and, bridge, traffic, between, two, or, more, network, segments, to, form, a, single, local, network, both, are, devices, that, forward, frames, of, data, between, ports, based, on, the, destination, mac, address, in, each, frame, they, learn, the, association, of, physical, ports, to, mac, addresses, by, examining, the, source, addresses, of, received, frames, and, only, forward, the, frame, when, necessary, if, an, unknown, destination, mac, is, targeted, the, device, broadcasts, the, request, to, all, ports, except, the, source, and, discovers, the, location, from, the, reply, bridges, and, switches, divide, the, network, s, collision, domain, but, maintain, a, single, broadcast, domain, network, segmentation, through, bridging, and, switching, helps, break, down, a, large, congested, network, into, an, aggregation, of, smaller, more, efficient, networks, a, router, is, an, internetworking, device, that, forwards, packets, between, networks, by, processing, the, addressing, or, routing, information, included, in, the, packet, the, routing, information, is, often, processed, in, conjunction, with, the, routing, table, a, router, uses, its, routing, table, to, determine, where, to, forward, packets, and, does, not, require, broadcasting, packets, which, is, inefficient, for, very, big, networks, modems, modulator, demodulator, are, used, to, connect, network, nodes, via, wire, not, originally, designed, for, digital, network, traffic, or, for, wireless, to, do, this, one, or, more, carrier, signals, are, modulated, by, the, digital, signal, to, produce, an, analog, signal, that, can, be, tailored, to, give, the, required, properties, for, transmission, early, modems, modulated, audio, signals, sent, over, a, standard, voice, telephone, line, modems, are, still, commonly, used, for, telephone, lines, using, a, digital, subscriber, line, technology, and, cable, television, systems, using, docsis, technology, a, firewall, is, a, network, device, or, software, for, controlling, network, security, and, access, rules, firewalls, are, inserted, in, connections, between, secure, internal, networks, and, potentially, insecure, external, networks, such, as, the, internet, firewalls, are, typically, configured, to, reject, access, requests, from, unrecognized, sources, while, allowing, actions, from, recognized, ones, the, vital, role, firewalls, play, in, network, security, grows, in, parallel, with, the, constant, increase, in, cyber, attacks, a, communication, protocol, is, a, set, of, rules, for, exchanging, information, over, a, network, communication, protocols, have, various, characteristics, they, may, be, connection, oriented, or, connectionless, they, may, use, circuit, mode, or, packet, switching, and, they, may, use, hierarchical, addressing, or, flat, addressing, in, a, protocol, stack, often, constructed, per, the, osi, model, communications, functions, are, divided, up, into, protocol, layers, where, each, layer, leverages, the, services, of, the, layer, below, it, until, the, lowest, layer, controls, the, hardware, that, sends, information, across, the, media, the, use, of, protocol, layering, is, ubiquitous, across, the, field, of, computer, networking, an, important, example, of, a, protocol, stack, is, http, the, world, wide, web, protocol, running, over, tcp, over, ip, the, internet, protocols, over, ieee, 802, 11, the, wi, fi, protocol, this, stack, is, used, between, the, wireless, router, and, the, home, user, s, personal, computer, when, the, user, is, surfing, the, web, there, are, many, communication, protocols, a, few, of, which, are, described, below, the, internet, protocol, suite, also, called, tcp, ip, is, the, foundation, of, all, modern, networking, it, offers, connection, less, and, connection, oriented, services, over, an, inherently, unreliable, network, traversed, by, datagram, transmission, using, internet, protocol, ip, at, its, core, the, protocol, suite, defines, the, addressing, identification, and, routing, specifications, for, internet, protocol, version, 4, ipv4, and, for, ipv6, the, next, generation, of, the, protocol, with, a, much, enlarged, addressing, capability, the, internet, protocol, suite, is, the, defining, set, of, protocols, for, the, internet, ieee, 802, is, a, family, of, ieee, standards, dealing, with, local, area, networks, and, metropolitan, area, networks, the, complete, ieee, 802, protocol, suite, provides, a, diverse, set, of, networking, capabilities, the, protocols, have, a, flat, addressing, scheme, they, operate, mostly, at, layers, 1, and, 2, of, the, osi, model, for, example, mac, bridging, ieee, 802, 1d, deals, with, the, routing, of, ethernet, packets, using, a, spanning, tree, protocol, ieee, 802, 1q, describes, vlans, and, ieee, 802, 1x, defines, a, port, based, network, access, control, protocol, which, forms, the, basis, for, the, authentication, mechanisms, used, in, vlans, but, it, is, also, found, in, wlans, it, is, what, the, home, user, sees, when, the, user, has, to, enter, a, wireless, access, key, ethernet, is, a, family, of, technologies, used, in, wired, lans, it, is, described, by, a, set, of, standards, together, called, ieee, 802, 3, published, by, the, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, wireless, lan, based, on, the, ieee, 802, 11, standards, also, widely, known, as, wlan, or, wifi, is, probably, the, most, well, known, member, of, the, ieee, 802, protocol, family, for, home, users, today, ieee, 802, 11, shares, many, properties, with, wired, ethernet, synchronous, optical, networking, sonet, and, synchronous, digital, hierarchy, sdh, are, standardized, multiplexing, protocols, that, transfer, multiple, digital, bit, streams, over, optical, fiber, using, lasers, they, were, originally, designed, to, transport, circuit, mode, communications, from, a, variety, of, different, sources, primarily, to, support, circuit, switched, digital, telephony, however, due, to, its, protocol, neutrality, and, transport, oriented, features, sonet, sdh, also, was, the, obvious, choice, for, transporting, asynchronous, transfer, mode, atm, frames, asynchronous, transfer, mode, atm, is, a, switching, technique, for, telecommunication, networks, it, uses, asynchronous, time, division, multiplexing, and, encodes, data, into, small, fixed, sized, cells, this, differs, from, other, protocols, such, as, the, internet, protocol, suite, or, ethernet, that, use, variable, sized, packets, or, frames, atm, has, similarities, with, both, circuit, and, packet, switched, networking, this, makes, it, a, good, choice, for, a, network, that, must, handle, both, traditional, high, throughput, data, traffic, and, real, time, low, latency, content, such, as, voice, and, video, atm, uses, a, connection, oriented, model, in, which, a, virtual, circuit, must, be, established, between, two, endpoints, before, the, actual, data, exchange, begins, atm, still, plays, a, role, in, the, last, mile, which, is, the, connection, between, an, internet, service, provider, and, the, home, user, there, are, a, number, of, different, digital, cellular, standards, including, global, system, for, mobile, communications, gsm, general, packet, radio, service, gprs, cdmaone, cdma2000, evolution, data, optimized, ev, do, enhanced, data, rates, for, gsm, evolution, edge, universal, mobile, telecommunications, system, umts, digital, enhanced, cordless, telecommunications, dect, digital, amps, is, 136, tdma, and, integrated, digital, enhanced, network, iden, routing, is, the, process, of, selecting, network, paths, to, carry, network, traffic, routing, is, performed, for, many, kinds, of, networks, including, circuit, switching, networks, and, packet, switched, networks, in, packet, switched, networks, routing, protocols, direct, packet, forwarding, through, intermediate, nodes, intermediate, nodes, are, typically, network, hardware, devices, such, as, routers, bridges, gateways, firewalls, or, switches, general, purpose, computers, can, also, forward, packets, and, perform, routing, though, because, they, lack, specialized, hardware, may, offer, limited, performance, the, routing, process, directs, forwarding, on, the, basis, of, routing, tables, which, maintain, a, record, of, the, routes, to, various, network, destinations, most, routing, algorithms, use, only, one, network, path, at, a, time, multipath, routing, techniques, enable, the, use, of, multiple, alternative, paths, routing, can, be, contrasted, with, bridging, in, its, assumption, that, network, addresses, are, structured, and, that, similar, addresses, imply, proximity, within, the, network, structured, addresses, allow, a, single, routing, table, entry, to, represent, the, route, to, a, group, of, devices, in, large, networks, the, structured, addressing, used, by, routers, outperforms, unstructured, addressing, used, by, bridging, structured, ip, addresses, are, used, on, the, internet, unstructured, mac, addresses, are, used, for, bridging, on, ethernet, and, similar, local, area, networks, networks, may, be, characterized, by, many, properties, or, features, such, as, physical, capacity, organizational, purpose, user, authorization, access, rights, and, others, another, distinct, classification, method, is, that, of, the, physical, extent, or, geographic, scale, a, nanoscale, network, has, key, components, implemented, at, the, nanoscale, including, message, carriers, and, leverages, physical, principles, that, differ, from, macroscale, communication, mechanisms, nanoscale, communication, extends, communication, to, very, small, sensors, and, actuators, such, as, those, found, in, biological, systems, and, also, tends, to, operate, in, environments, that, would, be, too, harsh, for, other, communication, techniques, a, personal, area, network, pan, is, a, computer, network, used, for, communication, among, computers, and, different, information, technological, devices, close, to, one, person, some, examples, of, devices, that, are, used, in, a, pan, are, personal, computers, printers, fax, machines, telephones, pdas, scanners, and, video, game, consoles, a, pan, may, include, wired, and, wireless, devices, the, reach, of, a, pan, typically, extends, to, 10, meters, a, wired, pan, is, usually, constructed, with, usb, and,

typically, deployed, in, the, home, usually, a, small, number, of, personal, computers, and, accessories, such, as, printers, and, mobile, computing, devices, an, important, function, is, the, sharing, of, internet, access, often, a, broadband, service, through, a, cable, internet, access, or, digital, subscriber, line, dsl, provider, a, storage, area, network, san, is, a, dedicated, network, that, provides, access, to, consolidated, block, level, data, storage, sans, are, primarily, used, to, make, storage, devices, such, as, disk, arrays, tape, libraries, and, optical, jukeboxes, accessible, to, servers, so, that, the, storage, appears, as, locally, attached, devices, to, the, operating, system, a, san, typically, has, its, own, network, of, storage, devices, that, are, generally, not, accessible, through, the, local, area, network, by, other, devices, the, cost, and, complexity, of, sans, dropped, in, the, early, 2000s, to, levels, allowing, wider, adoption, across, both, enterprise, and, small, to, medium, sized, business, environments, a, campus, area, network, can, is, made, up, of, an, interconnection, of, lans, within, a, limited, geographical, area, the, networking, equipment, switches, routers, and, transmission, media, optical, fiber, cat5, cabling, etc, are, almost, entirely, owned, by, the, campus, tenant, or, owner, an, enterprise, university, government, etc, for, example, a, university, campus, network, is, likely, to, link, a, variety, of, campus, buildings, to, connect, academic, colleges, or, departments, the, library, and, student, residence, halls, a, backbone, network, is, part, of, a, computer, network, infrastructure, that, provides, a, path, for, the, exchange, of, information, between, different, lans, or, subnetworks, a, backbone, can, tie, together, diverse, networks, within, the, same, building, across, different, buildings, or, over, a, wide, area, when, designing, a, network, backbone, network, performance, and, network, congestion, are, critical, factors, to, take, into, account, normally, the, backbone, network, s, capacity, is, greater, than, that, of, the, individual, networks, connected, to, it, for, example, a, large, company, might, implement, a, backbone, network, to, connect, departments, that, are, located, around, the, world, the, equipment, that, ties, together, the, departmental, networks, constitutes, the, network, backbone, another, example, of, a, backbone, network, is, the, internet, backbone, which, is, a, massive, global, system, of, fiber, optic, cable,

internet, instead, of, by, physical, wires, the, data, link, layer, protocols, of, the, virtual, network, are, said, to, be, tunneled, through, the, larger, network, one, common, application, is, secure, communications, through, the, public, internet, but, a, vpn, need, not, have, explicit, security, features, such, as, authentication, or, content, encryption, vpns, for, example, can, be, used, to, separate, the, traffic, of, different, user, communities, over, an, underlying, network, with, strong, security, features, vpn, may, have, best, effort, performance, or, may, have, a, defined, service, level, agreement, sla, between, the, vpn, customer, and, the, vpn, service, provider, a, global, area, network, gan, is, a, network, used, for, supporting, mobile, users, across, an, arbitrary, number, of, wireless, lans, satellite, coverage, areas, etc, the, key, challenge, in, mobile, communications, is, handing, off, communications, from, one, local, coverage, area, to, the, next, in, ieee, project, 802, this, involves, a, succession, of, terrestrial, wireless, lans, networks, are, typically, managed, by, the, organizations, that, own, them, private, enterprise, networks, may, use, a, combination, of, intranets, and, extranets, they, may, also, provide, network, access, to, the, internet, which, has, no, single, owner, and, permits, virtually, unlimited, global, connectivity, an, intranet, is, a, set, of, networks, that, are, under, the, control, of, a, single, administrative, entity, an, intranet, typically, uses, the, internet, protocol, and, ip, based, tools, such, as, web, browsers, and, file, transfer, applications, the, administrative, entity, limits, the, use, of, the, intranet, to, its, authorized, users, most, commonly, an, intranet, is, the, internal, lan, of, an, organization, a, large, intranet, typically, has, at, least, one, web, server, to, provide, users, with, organizational, information, an, extranet, is, a, network, that, is, under, the, administrative, control, of, a, single, organization, but, supports, a, limited, connection, to, a, specific, external, network, for, example, an, organization, may, provide, access, to, some, aspects, of, its, intranet, to, share, data, with, its, business, partners, or, customers, these, other, entities, are, not, necessarily, trusted, from, a, security, standpoint, the, network, connection, to, an, extranet, is, often, but, not, always, implemented, via, wan, technology, an, internetwork, is, the, connection, of, multiple, different, types, of, computer, networks, to, form, a, single, computer, network, using, higher, layer, network, protocols, and, connecting, them, together, using, routers, the, internet, is, the, largest, example, of, internetwork, it, is, a, global, system, of, interconnected, governmental, academic, corporate, public, and, private, computer, networks, it, is, based, on, the, networking, technologies, of, the, internet, protocol, suite, it, is, the, successor, of, the, advanced, research, projects, agency, network, arpanet, developed, by, darpa, of, the, united, states, department, of, defense, the, internet, utilizes, copper, communications, and, an, optical, networking, backbone, to, enable, the, world, wide, web, www, the, internet, of, things, video, transfer, and, a, broad, range, of, information, services, participants, on, the, internet, use, a, diverse, array, of, methods, of, several, hundred, documented, and, often, standardized, protocols, compatible, with, the, internet, protocol, suite, and, the, ip, addressing, system, administered, by, the, internet, assigned, numbers, authority, and, address, registries, service, providers, and, large, enterprises, exchange, information, about, the, reachability, of, their, address, spaces, through, the, border, gateway, protocol, bgp, forming, a, redundant, worldwide, mesh, of, transmission, paths, a, darknet, is, an, overlay, network, typically, running, on, the, internet, that, is, only, accessible, through, specialized, software, it, is, an, anonymizing, network, where, connections, are, made, only, between, trusted, peers, sometimes, called, friends, f2f, using, non, standard, protocols, and, ports, darknets, are, distinct, from, other, distributed, peer, to, peer, networks, as, sharing, is, anonymous, that, is, ip, addresses, are, not, publicly, shared, and, therefore, users, can, communicate, with, little, fear, of, governmental, or, corporate, interference, network, services, are, applications, hosted, by, servers, on, a, computer, network, to, provide, some, functionality, for, members, or, users, of, the, network, or, to, help, the, network, itself, to, operate, the, world, wide, web, e, mail, printing, and, network, file, sharing, are, examples, of, well, known, network, services, network, services, such, as, domain, name, system, dns, give, names, for, ip, and, mac, addresses, people, remember, names, like, nm, lan, better, than, numbers, like, 210, 121, 67, 18, and, dynamic, host, configuration, protocol, dhcp, to, ensure, that, the, equipment, on, the, network, has, a, valid, ip, address, services, are, usually, based, on, a, service, protocol, that, defines, the, format, and, sequencing, of, messages, between, clients, and, servers, of, that, network, service, bandwidth, in, bit, s, may, refer, to, consumed, bandwidth, corresponding, to, achieved, throughput, or, goodput, i, e, the, average, rate, of, successful, data, transfer, through, a, communication, path, the, throughput, is, affected, by, processes, such, as, bandwidth, shaping, bandwidth, management, bandwidth, throttling, bandwidth, cap, and, bandwidth, allocation, using, for, example, bandwidth, allocation, protocol, and, dynamic, bandwidth, allocation, network, delay, is, a, design, and, performance, characteristic, of, a, telecommunications, network, it, specifies, the, latency, for, a, bit, of, data, to, travel, across, the, network, from, one, communication, endpoint, to, another, delay, may, differ, slightly, depending, on, the, location, of, the, specific, pair, of, communicating, endpoints, engineers, usually, report, both, the, maximum, and, average, delay, and, they, divide, the, delay, into, several, components, the, sum, of, which, is, the, total, delay, a, certain, minimum, level, of, delay, is, experienced, by, signals, due, to, the, time, it, takes, to, transmit, a, packet, serially, through, a, link, this, delay, is, extended, by, more, variable, levels, of, delay, due, to, network, congestion, ip, network, delays, can, range, from, less, than, a, microsecond, to, several, hundred, milliseconds, the, parameters, that, affect, performance, typically, can, include, throughput, jitter, bit, error, rate, and, latency, in, circuit, switched, networks, network, performance, is, synonymous, with, the, grade, of, service, the, number, of, rejected, calls, is, a, measure, of, how, well, the, network, is, performing, under, heavy, traffic, loads, other, types, of, performance, measures, can, include, the, level, of, noise, and, echo, in, an, asynchronous, transfer, mode, atm, network, performance, can, be, measured, by, line, rate, quality, of, service, qos, data, throughput, connect, time, stability, technology, modulation, technique, and, modem, enhancements, there, are, many, ways, to, measure, the, performance, of, a, network, as, each, network, is, different, in, nature, and, design, performance, can, also, be, modeled, instead, of, measured, for, example, state, transition, diagrams, are, often, used, to, model, queuing, performance, in, a, circuit, switched, network, the, network, planner, uses, these, diagrams, to, analyze, how, the, network, performs, in, each, state, ensuring, that, the, network, is, optimally, designed, network, congestion, occurs, when, a, link, or, node, is, subjected, to, a, greater, data, load, than, it, is, rated, for, resulting, in, a, deterioration, of, its, quality, of, service, when, networks, are, congested, and, queues, become, too, full, packets, have, to, be, discarded, and, participants, must, rely, on, retransmission, to, maintain, reliable, communications, typical, effects, of, congestion, include, queueing, delay, packet, loss, or, the, blocking, of, new, connections, a, consequence, of, these, latter, two, is, that, incremental, increases, in, offered, load, lead, either, to, only, a, small, increase, in, the, network, throughput, or, to, a, potential, reduction, in, network, throughput, network, protocols, that, use, aggressive, retransmissions, to, compensate, for, packet, loss, tend, to, keep, systems, in, a, state, of, network, congestion, even, after, the, initial, load, is, reduced, to, a, level, that, would, not, normally, induce, network, congestion, thus, networks, using, these, protocols, can, exhibit, two, stable, states, under, the, same, level, of, load, the, stable, state, with, low, throughput, is, known, as, congestive, collapse, modern, networks, use, congestion, control, congestion, avoidance, and, traffic, control, techniques, where, endpoints, typically, slow, down, or, sometimes, even, stop, transmission, entirely, when, the, network, is, congested, to, try, to, avoid, congestive, collapse, specific, techniques, include, exponential, backoff, in, protocols, such, as, 802, 11, s, csma, ca, and, the, original, ethernet, window, reduction, in, tcp, and, fair, queueing, in, devices, such, as, routers, another, method, to, avoid, the, negative, effects, of, network, congestion, is, implementing, quality, of, service, priority, schemes, allowing, selected, traffic, to, bypass, congestion, priority, schemes, do, not, solve, network, congestion, by, themselves, but, they, help, to, alleviate, the, effects, of, congestion, for, critical, services, a, third, method, to, avoid, network, congestion, is, the, explicit, allocation, of, network, resources, to, specific, flows, one, example, of, this, is, the, use, of, contention, free, transmission, opportunities, cftxops, in, the, itu, t, g, hn, home, networking, standard, for, the, internet, rfc, 2914, addresses, the, subject, of, congestion, control, in, detail, network, resilience, is, the, ability, to, provide, and, maintain, an, acceptable, level, of, service, in, the, face, of, faults, and, challenges, to, normal, operation, computer, networks, are, also, used, by, security, hackers, to, deploy, computer, viruses, or, computer, worms, on, devices, connected, to, the, network, or, to, prevent, these, devices, from, accessing, the, network, via, a, denial, of, service, attack, network, security, consists, of, provisions, and, policies, adopted, by, the, network, administrator, to, prevent, and, monitor, unauthorized, access, misuse, modification, or, denial, of, the, computer, network, and, its, network, accessible, resources, network, security, is, used, on, a, variety, of, computer, networks, both, public, and, private, to, secure, daily, transactions, and, communications, among, businesses, government, agencies, and, individuals, network, surveillance, is, the, monitoring, of, data, being, transferred, over, computer, networks, such, as, the, internet, the, monitoring, is, often, done, surreptitiously, and, may, be, done, by, or, at, the, behest, of, governments, by, corporations, criminal, organizations, or, individuals, it, may, or, may, not, be, legal, and, may, or, may, not, require, authorization, from, a, court, or, other, independent, agency, computer, and, network, surveillance, programs, are, widespread, today, and, almost, all, internet, traffic, is, or, could, potentially, be, monitored, for, clues, to, illegal, activity, surveillance, is, very, useful, to, governments, and, law, enforcement, to, maintain, social, control, recognize, and, monitor, threats, and, prevent, or, investigate, criminal, activity, with, the, advent, of, programs, such, as, the, total, information, awareness, program, technologies, such, as, high, speed, surveillance, computers, and, biometrics, software, and, laws, such, as, the, communications, assistance, for, law, enforcement, act, governments, now, possess, an, unprecedented, ability, to, monitor, the, activities, of, citizens, however, many, civil, rights, and, privacy, groups, such, as, reporters, without, borders, the, electronic, frontier, foundation, and, the, american, civil, liberties, union, have, expressed, concern, that, increasing, surveillance, of, citizens, may, lead, to, a, mass, surveillance, society, with, limited, political, and, personal, freedoms, fears, such, as, this, have, led, to, lawsuits, such, as, hepting, v, at, t, the, hacktivist, group, anonymous, has, hacked, into, government, websites, in, protest, of, what, it, considers, draconian, surveillance, end, to, end, encryption, e2ee, is, a, digital, communications, paradigm, of, uninterrupted, protection, of, data, traveling, between, two, communicating, parties, it, involves, the, originating, party, encrypting, data, so, only, the, intended, recipient, can, decrypt, it, with, no, dependency, on, third, parties, end, to, end, encryption, prevents, intermediaries, such, as, internet, service, providers, or, application, service, providers, from, reading, or, tampering, with, communications, end, to, end, encryption, generally, protects, both, confidentiality, and, integrity, examples, of, end, to, end, encryption, include, https, for, web, traffic, pgp, for, email, otr, for, instant, messaging, zrtp, for, telephony, and, tetra, for, radio, typical, server, based, communications, systems, do, not, include, end, to, end, encryption, these, systems, can, only, guarantee, the, protection, of, communications, between, clients, and, servers, not, between, the, communicating, parties, themselves, examples, of, non, e2ee, systems, are, google, talk, yahoo, messenger, facebook, and, dropbox, the, end, to, end, encryption, paradigm, does, not, directly, address, risks, at, the, endpoints, of, the, communication, themselves, such, as, the, technical, exploitation, of, clients, poor, quality, random, number, generators, or, key, escrow, e2ee, also, does, not, address, traffic, analysis, which, relates, to, things, such, as, the, identities, of, the, endpoints, and, the, times, and, quantities, of, messages, that, are, sent, the, introduction, and, rapid, growth, of, e, commerce, on, the, world, wide, web, in, the, mid, 1990s, made, it, obvious, that, some, form, of, authentication, and, encryption, was, needed, netscape, took, the, first, shot, at, a, new, standard, at, the, time, the, dominant, web, browser, was, netscape, navigator, netscape, created, a, standard, called, secure, socket, layer, ssl, ssl, requires, a, server, with, a, certificate, when, a, client, requests, access, to, an, ssl, secured, server, the, server, sends, a, copy, of, the, certificate, to, the, client, the, ssl, client, checks, this, certificate, all, web, browsers, come, with, an, exhaustive, list, of, root, certificates, preloaded, and, if, the, certificate, checks, out, the, server, is, authenticated, and, the, client, negotiates, a, symmetric, key, cipher, for, use, in, the, session, the, session, is, now, in, a, very, secure, encrypted, tunnel, between, the, ssl, server, and, the, ssl, client, users, and, network, administrators, typically, have, different, views, of, their, networks, users, can, share, printers, and, some, servers, from, a, workgroup, which, usually, means, they, are, in, the, same, geographic, location, and, are, on, the, same, lan, whereas, a, network, administrator, is, responsible, for, keeping, that, network, up, and, running, a, community, of, interest, has, less, of, a, connection, of, being, in, a, local, area, and, should, be, thought, of, as, a, set, of, arbitrarily, located, users, who, share, a, set, of, servers, and, possibly, also, communicate, via, peer, to, peer, technologies, network, administrators, can, see, networks, from, both, physical, and, logical, perspectives, the, physical, perspective, involves, geographic, locations, physical, cabling, and, the, network, elements, e, g, routers, bridges, and, application, layer, gateways, that, interconnect, via, the, transmission, media, logical, networks, called, in, the, tcp, ip, architecture, subnets, map, onto, one, or, more, transmission, media, for, example, a, common, practice, in, a, campus, of, buildings, is, to, make, a, set, of, lan, cables, in, each, building, appear, to, be, a, common, subnet, using, vlans, users, and, administrators, are, aware, to, varying, extents, of, a, network, s, trust, and, scope, characteristics, again, using, tcp, ip, architectural, terminology, an, intranet, is, a, community, of, interest, under, private, administration, usually, by, an, enterprise, and, is, only, accessible, by, authorized, users, e, g, employees, intranets, do, not, have, to, be, connected, to, the, internet, but, generally, have, a, limited, connection, an, extranet, is, an, extension, of, an, intranet, that, allows, secure, communications, to, users, outside, of, the, intranet, e, g, business, partners, customers, unofficially, the, internet, is, the, set, of, users, enterprises, and, content, providers, that, are, interconnected, by, internet, service, providers, isp, from, an, engineering, viewpoint, the, internet, is, the, set, of, subnets, and, aggregates, of, subnets, that, share, the, registered, ip, address, space, and, exchange, information, about, the, reachability, of, those, ip, addresses, using, the, border, gateway, protocol, typically, the, human, readable, names, of, servers, are, translated, to, ip, addresses, transparently, to, users, via, the, directory, function, of, the, domain, name, system, dns, over, the, internet, there, can, be, business, to, business, business, to, consumer, and, consumer, to, consumer, communications, when, money, or, sensitive, information, is, exchanged, the, communications, are, apt, to, be, protected, by, some, form, of, communications, security, mechanism, intranets, and, extranets, can, be, securely, superimposed, onto, the, internet, without, any, access, by, general, internet, users, and, administrators, using, secure, vpn, technology, this, article, incorporates, public, domain, material, from, federal, standard, 1037c, general,
