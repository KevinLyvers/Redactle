bleach, is, the, generic, name, for, any, chemical, product, that, is, used, industrially, or, domestically, to, remove, colour, whitening, from, fabric, or, fiber, in, a, process, called, bleaching, or, to, disinfect, after, cleaning, it, often, refers, specifically, to, a, dilute, solution, of, sodium, hypochlorite, also, called, liquid, bleach, many, bleaches, have, broad, spectrum, bactericidal, properties, making, them, useful, for, disinfecting, and, sterilizing, they, are, used, in, swimming, pool, sanitation, to, control, bacteria, viruses, and, algae, and, in, many, places, where, sterile, conditions, are, required, they, are, also, used, in, many, industrial, processes, notably, in, the, bleaching, of, wood, pulp, bleaches, also, have, other, minor, uses, like, removing, mildew, killing, weeds, and, increasing, the, longevity, of, cut, flowers, bleaches, work, by, reacting, with, many, coloured, organic, compounds, such, as, natural, pigments, and, turning, them, into, colourless, ones, while, most, bleaches, are, oxidizing, agents, chemicals, that, can, remove, electrons, from, other, molecules, some, are, reducing, agents, that, donate, electrons, chlorine, a, powerful, oxidizer, is, the, active, agent, in, many, household, bleaches, since, pure, chlorine, is, a, toxic, corrosive, gas, these, products, usually, contain, hypochlorite, which, releases, chlorine, bleaching, powder, usually, refers, to, a, formulation, containing, calcium, hypochlorite, oxidizing, bleaching, agents, that, do, not, contain, chlorine, are, usually, based, on, peroxides, such, as, hydrogen, peroxide, sodium, percarbonate, and, sodium, perborate, these, bleaches, are, called, non, chlorine, bleach, oxygen, bleach, or, colour, safe, bleach, reducing, bleaches, have, niche, uses, such, as, sulfur, dioxide, which, is, used, to, bleach, wool, either, as, gas, or, from, solutions, of, sodium, dithionite, and, sodium, borohydride, bleaches, generally, react, with, many, other, organic, substances, besides, the, intended, coloured, pigments, so, they, can, weaken, or, damage, natural, materials, like, fibers, cloth, and, leather, and, intentionally, applied, dyes, such, as, the, indigo, of, denim, for, the, same, reason, ingestion, of, the, products, breathing, of, the, fumes, or, contact, with, skin, or, eyes, can, cause, bodily, harm, and, damage, health, the, earliest, form, of, bleaching, involved, spreading, fabrics, and, cloth, out, in, a, bleachfield, to, be, whitened, by, the, action, of, the, sun, and, water, in, the, 17th, century, there, was, a, significant, cloth, bleaching, industry, in, western, europe, using, alternating, alkaline, baths, generally, lye, and, acid, baths, such, as, lactic, acid, from, sour, milk, and, later, diluted, sulfuric, acid, the, whole, process, lasted, up, to, six, months, chlorine, based, bleaches, which, shortened, that, process, from, months, to, hours, were, invented, in, europe, in, the, late, 18th, century, swedish, chemist, carl, wilhelm, scheele, discovered, chlorine, in, 1774, and, in, 1785, savoyard, scientist, claude, berthollet, recognized, that, it, could, be, used, to, bleach, fabrics, berthollet, also, discovered, sodium, hypochlorite, which, became, the, first, commercial, bleach, named, eau, de, javel, javel, water, after, the, borough, of, javel, near, paris, where, it, was, produced, scottish, chemist, and, industrialist, charles, tennant, proposed, in, 1798, a, solution, of, calcium, hypochlorite, as, an, alternative, for, javel, water, and, patented, bleaching, powder, solid, calcium, hypochlorite, in, 1799, around, 1820, french, chemist, antoine, germain, labarraque, discovered, the, disinfecting, and, deodorizing, ability, of, hypochlorites, and, was, instrumental, in, popularizing, their, use, for, such, purpose, his, work, greatly, improved, medical, practice, public, health, and, the, sanitary, conditions, in, hospitals, slaughterhouses, and, all, industries, dealing, with, animal, products, louis, jacques, th, nard, first, produced, hydrogen, peroxide, in, 1818, by, reacting, barium, peroxide, with, nitric, acid, hydrogen, peroxide, was, first, used, for, bleaching, in, 1882, but, did, not, become, commercially, important, until, after, 1930, sodium, perborate, as, a, laundry, bleach, has, been, used, in, europe, since, the, early, twentieth, century, and, became, popular, in, north, america, in, the, 1980s, colours, of, natural, organic, materials, typically, arise, from, organic, pigments, such, as, beta, carotene, chemical, bleaches, work, in, one, of, two, ways, sunlight, acts, as, a, bleach, through, a, process, leading, to, similar, results, high, energy, photons, of, light, often, in, the, violet, or, ultraviolet, range, can, disrupt, the, bonds, in, the, chromophore, rendering, the, resulting, substance, colourless, extended, exposure, often, leads, to, massive, discolouration, usually, reducing, the, colours, to, a, white, and, typically, very, faded, blue, the, broad, spectrum, effectiveness, of, most, bleaches, is, due, to, their, general, chemical, reactivity, against, organic, compounds, rather, than, the, selective, inhibitory, or, toxic, actions, of, antibiotics, they, irreversibly, denature, or, destroy, many, proteins, including, all, prions, making, them, extremely, versatile, disinfectants, hypochlorite, bleaches, in, low, concentration, were, also, found, to, attack, bacteria, by, interfering, with, heat, shock, proteins, on, their, walls, according, to, 2013, home, hygiene, and, health, report, using, bleach, whether, chlorine, or, peroxide, based, significantly, increases, germicidal, efficiency, of, laundry, even, at, low, temperatures, 30, 40, degrees, celsius, which, makes, it, possible, to, eliminate, viruses, bacteria, and, fungi, from, a, variety, of, clothing, in, a, home, setting, most, industrial, and, household, bleaches, belong, to, three, broad, classes, chlorine, based, bleaches, are, found, in, many, household, bleach, products, as, well, as, in, specialized, products, for, hospitals, public, health, water, chlorination, and, industrial, processes, the, grade, of, chlorine, based, bleaches, is, often, expressed, as, percent, active, chlorine, one, gram, of, 100, active, chlorine, bleach, has, the, same, bleaching, power, as, one, gram, of, elemental, chlorine, the, most, common, chlorine, based, bleaches, are, other, examples, of, chlorine, based, bleaches, used, mostly, as, disinfectants, are, monochloramine, halazone, and, sodium, dichloroisocyanurate, peroxide, based, bleaches, are, characterized, by, the, peroxide, chemical, group, namely, two, oxygen, atoms, connected, by, a, single, bond, o, o, this, bond, is, easily, broken, giving, rise, to, very, reactive, oxygen, species, which, are, the, active, agents, of, bleach, the, main, products, in, this, class, are, in, the, food, industry, other, oxidizing, products, like, bromates, are, used, as, flour, bleaching, and, maturing, agents, sodium, dithionite, also, known, as, sodium, hydrosulfite, is, one, of, the, most, important, reductive, bleaching, agents, it, is, a, white, crystalline, powder, with, a, weak, sulfurous, odor, it, can, be, obtained, by, reacting, sodium, bisulfite, with, zinc, it, is, used, as, such, in, some, industrial, dyeing, processes, to, eliminate, excess, dye, residual, oxide, and, unintended, pigments, and, for, bleaching, wood, pulp, reaction, of, sodium, dithionite, with, formaldehyde, produces, rongalite, which, is, used, in, bleaching, wood, pulp, cotton, wool, leather, and, clay, in, negative, film, processing, silver, halide, grains, are, associated, with, couplers, which, on, development, produce, metallic, silver, and, a, coloured, image, the, silver, is, bleached, to, a, soluble, form, in, a, solution, of, ferric, edta, which, is, then, dissolved, in, fix, a, solution, of, sodium, or, ammonium, thiosulfate, the, procedure, is, the, same, for, paper, processing, except, that, the, edta, and, thiosulfate, are, mixed, in, bleachfix, in, reversal, processing, residual, silver, in, the, emulsion, after, the, first, development, is, reduced, to, a, soluble, silver, salt, using, a, chemical, bleach, most, commonly, edta, a, conventional, fixer, then, dissolves, the, reduced, silver, but, leaves, the, unexposed, silver, halide, intact, this, unexposed, halide, is, then, exposed, to, light, or, chemically, treated, so, that, a, second, development, produces, a, positive, image, in, colour, and, chromogenic, film, this, also, generates, a, dye, image, in, proportion, to, the, silver, photographic, bleaches, are, also, used, in, black, and, white, photography, to, selectively, reduce, silver, to, reduce, silver, density, in, negatives, or, prints, in, such, cases, the, bleach, composition, is, typically, an, acid, solution, of, potassium, dichromate, a, risk, assessment, report, rar, conducted, by, the, european, union, on, sodium, hypochlorite, conducted, under, regulation, eec, 793, 93, concluded, that, this, substance, is, safe, for, the, environment, in, all, its, current, normal, uses, this, is, due, to, its, high, reactivity, and, instability, the, disappearance, of, hypochlorite, is, practically, immediate, in, the, natural, aquatic, environment, reaching, in, a, short, time, concentration, as, low, as, 10, 22, g, l, or, less, in, all, emission, scenarios, in, addition, it, was, found, that, while, volatile, chlorine, species, may, be, relevant, in, some, indoor, scenarios, they, have, a, negligible, impact, in, open, environmental, conditions, further, the, role, of, hypochlorite, pollution, is, assumed, as, negligible, in, soils, industrial, bleaching, agents, can, be, sources, of, concern, for, example, the, use, of, elemental, chlorine, in, the, bleaching, of, wood, pulp, produces, organochlorines, and, persistent, organic, pollutants, including, dioxins, according, to, an, industry, group, the, use, of, chlorine, dioxide, in, these, processes, has, reduced, the, dioxin, generation, to, under, detectable, levels, however, the, respiratory, risk, from, chlorine, and, highly, toxic, chlorinated, byproducts, still, exists, a, european, study, conducted, in, 2008, indicated, that, sodium, hypochlorite, and, organic, chemicals, e, g, surfactants, fragrances, contained, in, several, household, cleaning, products, can, react, to, generate, chlorinated, volatile, organic, compounds, vocs, these, chlorinated, compounds, are, emitted, during, cleaning, applications, some, of, which, are, toxic, and, probable, human, carcinogens, the, study, showed, that, indoor, air, concentrations, significantly, increase, 8, 52, times, for, chloroform, and, 1, 1170, times, for, carbon, tetrachloride, respectively, above, baseline, quantities, in, the, household, during, the, use, of, bleach, containing, products, the, increase, in, chlorinated, volatile, organic, compound, concentrations, was, the, lowest, for, plain, bleach, and, the, highest, for, the, products, in, the, form, of, thick, liquid, and, gel, the, significant, increases, observed, in, indoor, air, concentrations, of, several, chlorinated, vocs, especially, carbon, tetrachloride, and, chloroform, indicate, that, bleach, use, may, be, a, source, that, could, be, important, in, terms, of, inhalation, exposure, to, these, compounds, while, the, authors, suggested, that, using, these, cleaning, products, may, significantly, increase, the, cancer, risk, this, conclusion, appears, to, be, hypothetical, sodium, hypochlorite, solution, 3, 6, common, household, bleach, is, typically, diluted, for, safe, use, when, disinfecting, surfaces, and, when, used, to, treat, drinking, water, a, weak, solution, of, 2, household, bleach, in, warm, water, is, typical, for, sanitizing, smooth, surfaces, before, the, brewing, of, beer, or, wine, us, government, regulations, 21, cfr, 178, subpart, c, allow, food, processing, equipment, and, food, contact, surfaces, to, be, sanitized, with, solutions, containing, bleach, provided, that, the, solution, is, allowed, to, drain, adequately, before, contact, with, food, and, that, the, solutions, do, not, exceed, 200, parts, per, million, ppm, available, chlorine, for, example, one, tablespoon, of, typical, household, bleach, containing, 5, 25, sodium, hypochlorite, per, gallon, of, water, a, 1, in, 47, dilution, of, household, bleach, with, water, 1, part, bleach, to, 47, parts, water, e, g, one, teaspoon, of, bleach, in, a, cup, of, water, or, 21, ml, per, litre, or, 1, 3, cup, of, bleach, in, a, gallon, of, water, is, effective, against, many, bacteria, and, some, viruses, in, homes, even, scientific, grade, commercially, produced, disinfection, solutions, such, as, virocidin, x, usually, have, sodium, hypochlorite, as, their, sole, active, ingredient, though, they, also, contain, surfactants, to, prevent, beading, and, fragrances, to, conceal, the, bleach, smell, see, hypochlorous, acid, for, a, discussion, of, the, mechanism, for, disinfectant, action, an, oral, rinse, with, a, 0, 05, dilute, solution, of, household, bleach, is, shown, to, treat, gingivitis, colour, safe, bleach, is, a, solution, with, hydrogen, peroxide, as, the, active, ingredient, for, stain, removal, rather, than, sodium, hypochlorite, or, chlorine, it, also, has, chemicals, in, it, that, help, brighten, colours, though, hydrogen, peroxide, is, used, for, sterilization, purposes, and, water, treatment, its, ability, to, disinfect, laundry, is, limited, because, the, concentration, of, hydrogen, peroxide, in, laundry, products, is, lower, than, what, is, used, in, other, applications, the, safety, of, bleaches, depends, on, the, compounds, present, and, their, concentration, generally, speaking, the, ingestion, of, bleaches, will, cause, damage, to, the, esophagus, and, stomach, possibly, leading, to, death, on, contact, with, the, skin, or, eyes, it, causes, irritation, drying, and, potentially, burns, inhalation, of, bleach, fumes, can, cause, mild, irritation, of, the, upper, airways, personal, protective, equipment, should, always, be, used, when, using, bleach, bleach, should, never, be, mixed, with, vinegar, or, other, acids, as, this, will, create, highly, toxic, chlorine, gas, which, can, cause, severe, burns, internally, and, externally, mixing, bleach, with, ammonia, similarly, produces, chloramine, gas, which, can, burn, the, lungs, mixing, bleach, with, rubbing, alcohol, or, acetone, makes, chloroform, while, mixing, with, hydrogen, peroxide, results, in, an, exothermic, and, potentially, explosive, chemical, reaction, that, releases, oxygen, miracle, mineral, supplement, mms, also, promoted, as, master, mineral, solution, or, chlorine, dioxide, solution, or, cds, to, evade, restrictions, by, online, retail, platforms, is, a, bleach, solution, that, has, been, fraudulently, promoted, as, a, cure, all, since, 2006, its, main, active, ingredient, is, sodium, chlorite, which, is, activated, with, citric, acid, to, form, chlorine, dioxide, in, an, attempt, to, evade, health, regulations, its, inventor, jim, humble, a, former, scientologist, founded, the, genesis, ii, church, of, health,
