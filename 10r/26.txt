horticulture, is, the, art, and, science, of, growing, plants, this, definition, is, seen, in, its, etymology, which, is, derived, from, the, latin, words, hortus, which, means, garden, and, cultura, which, means, to, cultivate, there, are, various, divisions, of, horticulture, because, plants, are, grown, for, a, variety, of, purposes, these, divisions, include, but, are, not, limited, to, gardening, plant, production, propagation, arboriculture, landscaping, floriculture, and, turf, maintenance, for, each, of, these, there, are, various, professions, aspects, tools, used, and, associated, challenges, each, requiring, highly, specialized, skills, and, knowledge, of, the, horticulturist, typically, horticulture, is, characterized, as, the, ornamental, small, scale, non, industrial, cultivation, of, plants, as, compared, to, the, large, scale, cultivation, of, crops, livestock, that, is, seen, in, agriculture, however, there, are, aspects, of, horticulture, that, are, industrialized, commercial, such, as, greenhouse, production, across, the, globe, horticulture, began, with, the, domestication, of, plants, around, 10, 000, 20, 000, years, ago, at, first, only, plants, for, sustenance, were, grown, and, maintained, but, eventually, as, humanity, became, increasingly, sedentary, plants, were, grown, for, their, ornamental, value, horticulture, is, considered, to, have, diverged, from, agriculture, during, the, middle, ages, when, people, started, growing, plants, for, pleasure, aesthetics, rather, than, just, for, sustenance, emerging, technologies, are, moving, the, industry, forward, especially, in, the, way, of, altering, plants, to, be, more, adverse, to, parasites, disease, and, drought, modifying, technologies, such, as, clustered, regularly, interspaced, short, palindromic, repeats, crispr, cas9, are, also, improving, the, nutrition, taste, and, yield, of, crops, there, are, many, horticultural, organizations, and, societies, found, around, the, world, that, are, formed, by, horticulturists, and, those, within, the, industry, these, include, the, royal, horticultural, society, international, society, for, horticultural, science, the, american, society, of, horticultural, science, the, horticultural, society, of, india, the, global, horticulture, initiative, the, chartered, institute, of, horticulture, and, the, australian, society, of, horticultural, science, there, are, divisions, and, sub, divisions, within, horticulture, this, is, because, plants, are, grown, for, many, different, reasons, some, of, the, divisions, in, horticulture, include, it, includes, the, cultivation, of, all, plants, including, but, not, limited, to, ornamental, trees, shrubs, plants, fruits, vegetables, flowers, turf, nuts, seeds, herbs, and, other, medicinal, edible, plants, this, cultivation, may, occur, in, garden, spaces, nurseries, greenhouses, vineyards, orchards, parks, recreation, areas, etc, horticulturists, are, those, who, study, and, practice, the, cultivation, of, plant, material, professionally, there, are, many, different, types, of, horticulturists, with, different, job, titles, including, gardener, grower, farmer, arborist, floriculturist, landscaper, agronomist, designer, landscape, architect, lawn, care, specialist, nursery, manager, botanical, garden, curator, horticulture, therapist, and, much, more, they, may, be, hired, by, a, variety, of, companies, institutions, including, but, not, limited, to, botanical, gardens, private, public, gardens, parks, cemeteries, greenhouses, golf, courses, vineyards, estates, landscaping, companies, nurseries, educational, institutions, etc, they, may, also, be, self, employed, horticulture, began, with, the, domestication, of, plants, 10, 000, 20, 000, years, ago, and, has, since, been, deeply, integrated, into, humanity, s, history, the, domestication, of, plants, occurred, independently, within, various, civilizations, across, the, globe, the, history, of, horticulture, overlaps, with, the, history, of, agriculture, and, history, of, botany, as, all, three, originated, with, the, domestication, of, various, plants, for, food, in, europe, agriculture, and, horticulture, diverged, at, some, point, during, the, middle, ages, early, practices, in, horticulture, include, a, number, of, various, ways, that, people, managed, the, land, using, an, assortment, of, tools, with, a, variety, of, methods, and, types, of, plants, cultivated, for, a, number, of, uses, methods, tools, and, plants, grown, have, always, depended, on, the, culture, and, climate, there, are, a, number, of, traditional, horticultural, practices, that, we, know, of, today, such, as, the, indigenous, peoples, of, pre, colonized, north, america, using, biochar, to, enhance, soil, productivity, by, smoldering, plant, waste, european, settlers, called, this, soil, terra, preta, de, indio, in, north, america, indigenous, people, grew, maize, squash, and, sunflower, among, other, crops, mesoamerican, cultures, focused, on, the, cultivating, of, crops, on, a, small, scale, such, as, the, milpa, or, maize, field, around, their, dwellings, or, in, specialized, plots, which, were, visited, occasionally, during, migrations, from, one, area, to, the, next, in, central, america, the, maya, involved, augmentation, of, the, forest, with, useful, trees, such, as, papaya, avocado, cacao, ceiba, and, sapodilla, in, the, fields, multiple, crops, such, as, beans, squash, pumpkins, and, chili, peppers, were, grown, the, first, horticulturists, in, many, cultures, were, mainly, or, exclusively, women, in, addition, to, the, medicinal, and, nutritional, values, that, plants, hold, plants, have, also, been, grown, for, their, beauty, and, to, impress, and, demonstrate, power, knowledge, status, and, even, wealth, of, those, in, control, of, the, cultivated, plant, material, this, symbolic, power, that, plants, hold, has, existed, even, before, the, beginnings, of, their, cultivation, there, is, evidence, that, various, gardens, maintained, by, the, aztecs, were, sacred, as, they, grew, plants, that, held, religious, value, plants, were, grown, for, their, metaphorical, relation, to, gods, and, goddesses, flowers, held, symbolic, power, in, religious, rites, as, they, were, offered, to, the, gods, as, well, as, were, given, in, ceremonies, to, leaders, to, demonstrate, their, connection, to, the, gods, plant, propagation, in, horticulture, is, the, process, in, which, the, multiplication, of, a, species, is, performed, increasing, the, number, of, individual, plants, propagation, involves, both, sexual, and, asexual, methods, in, sexual, propagation, seeds, are, used, while, asexual, propagation, involves, the, division, of, plants, separation, of, tubers, corms, and, bulbs, by, use, of, techniques, such, as, cutting, layering, grafting, when, selecting, plants, to, cultivate, a, horticulturist, may, consider, aspects, based, on, the, plants, intended, use, and, can, include, plant, morphology, rarity, and, utility, when, selecting, plants, for, the, landscape, there, are, necessary, observations, of, the, location, that, must, be, made, first, considerations, as, to, soil, type, temperature, climate, light, moisture, and, pre, existing, plants, are, made, these, evaluations, of, the, given, environment, are, taken, into, consideration, when, selecting, plant, material, for, the, location, plant, selection, may, be, for, annual, displays, or, they, may, be, for, more, permanent, plantings, characteristics, of, the, plant, such, as, mature, height, size, colour, growth, habit, ornamental, value, flowering, time, and, invasive, potential, are, what, finalizes, the, plant, selection, process, environmental, factors, that, effect, plant, development, include, temperature, light, water, ph, nutrient, availability, weather, events, rain, snow, sleet, hail, and, freezing, rain, dew, wind, and, frost, humidity, elevation, terrain, and, micro, climate, effects, in, horticulture, these, environmental, variables, may, be, avoided, controlled, or, manipulated, in, an, indoor, growing, environment, plants, require, specific, temperatures, to, grow, and, develop, properly, temperature, control, can, be, done, through, a, variety, of, methods, covering, plants, with, plastic, in, the, form, of, cones, called, hot, caps, or, tunnels, can, help, to, manipulate, the, surrounding, temperature, mulching, is, also, an, effective, method, to, protect, outdoor, plants, from, frost, during, the, wintertime, inside, other, frost, prevention, methods, include, the, use, of, wind, machines, heaters, and, sprinklers, plants, have, evolved, to, require, different, amounts, of, light, and, lengths, of, daytime, their, growth, and, development, is, determined, by, the, amount, of, light, light, intensity, that, they, receive, control, of, this, may, be, achieved, artificially, through, the, use, of, fluorescent, lights, in, an, indoor, setting, manipulating, the, amount, of, light, also, controls, flowering, lengthening, the, day, encourages, the, flowering, of, long, day, plants, and, discourages, the, flowering, of, short, day, plants, water, management, methods, involve, employing, irrigation, drainage, systems, and, controlling, soil, moisture, to, the, needs, of, the, species, methods, of, irrigation, include, surface, irrigation, sprinkler, irrigation, sub, irrigation, and, trickle, irrigation, volume, of, water, pressure, and, frequency, are, changed, to, optimize, the, growing, environment, on, a, small, scale, watering, can, be, done, manually, the, choice, of, growing, media, and, components, to, the, media, help, support, plant, life, within, a, greenhouse, environment, growers, may, choose, to, grow, their, plants, in, an, aquaponic, system, where, there, is, no, soil, used, growers, within, a, greenhouse, setting, will, often, opt, for, a, soilless, mix, which, does, not, include, any, actual, components, of, naturally, occurring, soil, these, mixes, offer, advantages, such, as, water, absorption, sterility, and, are, generally, very, available, within, the, industry, soil, management, methods, are, broad, but, includes, the, use, of, fertilizers, planned, crop, rotation, to, prevent, the, degradation, of, soils, that, are, seen, in, monocultures, applying, fertilizers, and, soil, analysis, abiotic, factors, such, as, weather, light, and, temperature, are, all, things, that, can, be, manipulated, with, enclosed, environments, such, as, cold, frames, greenhouses, conservatories, poly, houses, and, shade, houses, materials, that, are, used, in, the, construction, of, these, buildings, are, chosen, based, on, the, climate, purpose, and, budget, cold, frames, provide, an, enclosed, environment, they, are, built, close, to, the, ground, and, with, a, top, made, of, glass, or, plastic, the, glass, or, plastic, allows, sunlight, into, the, frame, during, the, day, and, prevents, heat, loss, that, would, have, been, lost, as, long, wave, radiation, at, night, this, allows, plants, to, start, to, be, grown, before, the, growing, season, starts, greenhouses, conservatories, are, similar, in, function, but, are, larger, in, construction, and, heated, with, an, external, energy, source, they, can, be, built, out, of, glass, although, they, are, now, primarily, made, from, plastic, sheets, more, expensive, and, modern, greenhouses, can, include, temperature, control, through, shade, and, light, control, or, air, conditioning, as, well, as, automatic, watering, shade, houses, provide, shading, to, limit, water, loss, by, evapotranspiration, commercial, horticulture, is, required, to, support, a, rapidly, growing, population, with, demands, for, its, products, due, to, global, climate, change, extremes, in, temperatures, strength, of, precipitation, events, flood, frequency, and, drought, length, and, frequency, are, increasing, together, with, other, abiotic, stressors, such, salinity, heavy, metal, toxicity, uv, damage, and, air, pollution, stressful, environments, are, created, for, crop, production, this, is, extrapolated, as, evapotranspiration, is, increased, soils, are, degraded, of, their, nutrients, and, oxygen, levels, are, depleted, resulting, in, up, to, a, 70, loss, in, crop, yield, living, organisms, such, as, bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, insects, weeds, and, native, plants, are, sources, of, biotics, stresses, and, can, deprive, the, host, of, its, nutrients, plants, respond, to, these, stresses, using, defence, mechanisms, such, as, morphological, and, structural, barriers, chemical, compounds, proteins, enzymes, and, hormones, the, impact, of, biotic, stresses, can, be, prevented, using, practices, such, as, incorporate, tilling, spraying, or, integrated, pest, management, ipm, care, is, required, to, reduce, damages, and, losses, to, horticultural, crops, during, harvest, compression, forces, occur, during, harvesting, and, horticultural, goods, can, be, hit, in, a, series, of, impacts, during, transport, and, packhouse, operations, different, techniques, are, used, to, minimize, mechanical, injuries, and, wounding, to, plants, such, as, clustered, regularly, interspaced, short, palindromic, repeats, crispr, cas9, has, recently, gained, recognition, as, a, highly, efficient, simplified, precise, and, low, cost, method, of, altering, the, genomes, of, species, since, 2013, crispr, has, been, used, to, enhance, a, variety, of, species, of, grains, fruits, and, vegetables, crops, are, modified, to, increase, their, resistance, to, biotic, and, abiotic, stressors, such, as, parasites, disease, and, drought, as, well, as, increase, yield, nutrition, and, flavour, additionally, crispr, has, been, used, to, edit, undesirable, traits, for, example, reducing, the, browning, and, production, of, toxic, and, bitter, substances, of, potatoes, crispr, has, also, been, employed, to, solve, issues, of, low, pollination, rates, and, low, fruit, yield, common, in, greenhouses, as, compared, to, genetically, modified, organisms, gmo, crispr, does, not, add, any, alien, dna, to, the, plant, s, genes, there, are, various, organizations, worldwide, that, focus, on, promoting, and, encouraging, research, and, education, in, all, branches, of, horticultural, science, such, organizations, include, the, international, society, for, horticultural, science, and, the, american, society, of, horticultural, science, in, the, united, kingdom, there, are, two, main, horticulture, societies, the, ancient, society, of, york, florists, is, the, oldest, horticultural, society, in, the, world, and, was, founded, in, 1768, this, organization, continues, to, host, four, horticultural, shows, annually, in, york, england, additionally, the, royal, horticultural, society, established, in, 1804, is, a, charity, in, united, kingdom, that, leads, on, the, encouragement, and, improvement, of, the, science, art, and, practice, of, horticulture, in, all, its, branches, the, organization, shares, the, knowledge, of, horticulture, through, its, community, learning, programs, and, world, class, gardens, and, shows, the, chartered, institute, of, horticulture, cih, is, the, chartered, professional, body, for, horticulturists, and, horticultural, scientists, representing, all, sectors, of, the, horticultural, industry, across, great, britain, ireland, and, overseas, it, is, the, only, horticultural, professional, body, where, its, top, professionals, can, achieve, chartered, status, and, become, a, chartered, horticulturist, the, australian, society, of, horticultural, science, was, established, in, 1990, as, a, professional, society, to, promote, and, enhance, australian, horticultural, science, and, industry, finally, the, new, zealand, horticulture, institute, is, another, known, horticultural, organization, in, india, the, horticultural, society, of, india, now, indian, academy, of, horticultural, sciences, is, the, oldest, society, which, was, established, in, 1941, at, lyallpur, punjab, now, in, pakistan, but, was, later, shifted, to, delhi, in, 1949, the, other, notable, organization, in, operation, since, 2005, is, the, society, for, promotion, of, horticulture, based, at, bengaluru, both, these, societies, publish, scholarly, journals, indian, journal, of, horticulture, and, journal, of, horticultural, sciences, for, the, advancement, of, horticultural, sciences, horticulture, in, the, indian, state, of, kerala, is, spearheaded, by, kerala, state, horticulture, mission, the, national, junior, horticultural, association, njha, was, established, in, 1934, and, was, the, first, organization, in, the, world, dedicated, solely, to, youth, and, horticulture, njha, programs, are, designed, to, help, young, people, obtain, a, basic, understanding, of, horticulture, and, develop, skills, in, this, ever, expanding, art, and, science, the, global, horticulture, initiative, globalhort, fosters, partnerships, and, collective, action, among, different, stakeholders, in, horticulture, this, organization, has, a, special, focus, on, horticulture, for, development, h4d, which, involves, using, horticulture, to, reduce, poverty, and, improve, nutrition, worldwide, globalhort, is, organized, in, a, consortium, of, national, and, international, organizations, which, collaborate, in, research, training, and, technology, generating, activities, designed, to, meet, mutually, agreed, upon, objectives, globalhort, is, a, non, profit, organization, registered, in, belgium
