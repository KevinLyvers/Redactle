metallurgy, is, a, domain, of, materials, science, and, engineering, that, studies, the, physical, and, chemical, behavior, of, metallic, elements, their, inter, metallic, compounds, and, their, mixtures, which, are, known, as, alloys, metallurgy, encompasses, both, the, science, and, the, technology, of, metals, including, the, production, of, metals, and, the, engineering, of, metal, components, used, in, products, for, both, consumers, and, manufacturers, metallurgy, is, distinct, from, the, craft, of, metalworking, metalworking, relies, on, metallurgy, in, a, similar, manner, to, how, medicine, relies, on, medical, science, for, technical, advancement, a, specialist, practitioner, of, metallurgy, is, known, as, a, metallurgist, the, science, of, metallurgy, is, further, subdivided, into, two, broad, categories, chemical, metallurgy, and, physical, metallurgy, chemical, metallurgy, is, chiefly, concerned, with, the, reduction, and, oxidation, of, metals, and, the, chemical, performance, of, metals, subjects, of, study, in, chemical, metallurgy, include, mineral, processing, the, extraction, of, metals, thermodynamics, electrochemistry, and, chemical, degradation, corrosion, in, contrast, physical, metallurgy, focuses, on, the, mechanical, properties, of, metals, the, physical, properties, of, metals, and, the, physical, performance, of, metals, topics, studied, in, physical, metallurgy, include, crystallography, material, characterization, mechanical, metallurgy, phase, transformations, and, failure, mechanisms, historically, metallurgy, has, predominately, focused, on, the, production, of, metals, metal, production, begins, with, the, processing, of, ores, to, extract, the, metal, and, includes, the, mixture, of, metals, to, make, alloys, metal, alloys, are, often, a, blend, of, at, least, two, different, metallic, elements, however, non, metallic, elements, are, often, added, to, alloys, in, order, to, achieve, properties, suitable, for, an, application, the, study, of, metal, production, is, subdivided, into, ferrous, metallurgy, also, known, as, black, metallurgy, and, non, ferrous, metallurgy, also, known, as, colored, metallurgy, ferrous, metallurgy, involves, processes, and, alloys, based, on, iron, while, non, ferrous, metallurgy, involves, processes, and, alloys, based, on, other, metals, the, production, of, ferrous, metals, accounts, for, 95, of, world, metal, production, modern, metallurgists, work, in, both, emerging, and, traditional, areas, as, part, of, an, interdisciplinary, team, alongside, material, scientists, and, other, engineers, some, traditional, areas, include, mineral, processing, metal, production, heat, treatment, failure, analysis, and, the, joining, of, metals, including, welding, brazing, and, soldering, emerging, areas, for, metallurgists, include, nanotechnology, superconductors, composites, biomedical, materials, electronic, materials, semiconductors, and, surface, engineering, metallurgy, derives, from, the, ancient, greek, metallourg, s, worker, in, metal, from, m, tallon, mine, metal, rgon, work, the, word, was, originally, an, alchemist, s, term, for, the, extraction, of, metals, from, minerals, the, ending, urgy, signifying, a, process, especially, manufacturing, it, was, discussed, in, this, sense, in, the, 1797, encyclop, dia, britannica, in, the, late, 19th, century, metallurgy, s, definition, was, extended, to, the, more, general, scientific, study, of, metals, alloys, and, related, processes, in, english, the, m, t, l, r, d, i, pronunciation, is, the, more, common, one, in, the, united, kingdom, the, m, t, l, r, d, i, pronunciation, is, the, more, common, one, in, the, united, states, us, and, is, the, first, listed, variant, in, various, american, dictionaries, including, merriam, webster, collegiate, and, american, heritage, the, earliest, recorded, metal, employed, by, humans, appears, to, be, gold, which, can, be, found, either, free, or, native, small, amounts, of, natural, gold, have, been, found, in, spanish, caves, dating, to, the, late, paleolithic, period, 40, 000, bc, silver, copper, tin, and, meteoric, iron, can, also, be, found, in, native, form, allowing, a, limited, amount, of, metalworking, in, early, cultures, native, copper, artifacts, have, been, documented, at, sites, in, anatolia, and, at, the, site, of, tell, maghzaliyah, in, iraq, dating, from, the, 7th, 6th, millennia, bc, with, the, use, of, copper, minerals, also, found, in, the, balkans, during, the, 7th, millennium, bc, metallurgy, likely, originated, in, the, balkans, with, the, earliest, confirmed, metallurgy, of, lead, copper, gold, bronze, and, probably, silver, the, area, of, the, balkans, and, carpathian, mountains, has, also, been, described, as, the, earliest, metallurgical, province, in, eurasia, certain, metals, such, as, tin, lead, and, copper, can, be, recovered, from, their, ores, by, simply, heating, the, rocks, in, a, fire, or, blast, furnace, in, a, process, known, as, smelting, the, first, evidence, of, copper, smelting, dating, from, the, 6th, millennium, bc, has, been, found, at, archaeological, sites, in, majdanpek, jarmovac, and, plo, nik, in, present, day, serbia, the, site, of, plo, nik, has, produced, a, smelted, copper, axe, dating, from, 5, 500, bc, belonging, to, the, vin, a, culture, the, balkans, and, adjacent, carpathian, region, were, the, location, of, major, chalcolithic, cultures, including, vin, a, varna, karanovo, gumelni, a, and, hamangia, which, are, often, grouped, together, under, the, name, of, old, europe, with, the, carpatho, balkan, region, described, as, the, earliest, metallurgical, province, in, eurasia, its, scale, and, technical, quality, of, metal, production, in, the, 6th, 5th, millennia, bc, totally, overshadowed, that, of, any, other, contemporary, production, centre, the, earliest, documented, use, of, lead, possibly, native, or, smelted, in, the, near, east, dates, from, the, 6th, millennium, bc, is, from, the, late, neolithic, settlements, of, yarim, tepe, and, arpachiyah, in, iraq, the, artifacts, suggest, that, lead, smelting, may, have, predated, copper, smelting, the, earliest, confirmed, metallurgy, of, lead, has, been, found, in, the, balkans, also, in, the, 6th, millennium, bc, copper, smelting, is, documented, at, sites, in, anatolia, and, at, the, site, of, tal, i, iblis, in, southeastern, iran, from, c, 5000, bc, copper, smelting, is, first, documented, in, the, delta, region, of, northern, egypt, in, c, 4000, bc, associated, with, the, maadi, culture, this, represents, the, earliest, evidence, for, smelting, in, africa, the, varna, necropolis, bulgaria, is, a, burial, site, located, in, the, western, industrial, zone, of, varna, approximately, 4, km, from, the, city, centre, internationally, considered, one, of, the, key, archaeological, sites, in, world, prehistory, the, oldest, gold, treasure, in, the, world, dating, from, 4, 600, bc, to, 4, 200, bc, was, discovered, at, the, site, the, gold, piece, dating, from, 4, 500, bc, found, in, 2019, in, durankulak, near, varna, is, another, important, example, other, signs, of, early, metals, are, found, from, the, third, millennium, bc, in, palmela, portugal, los, millares, spain, and, stonehenge, united, kingdom, the, precise, beginnings, however, have, not, be, clearly, ascertained, and, new, discoveries, are, both, continuous, and, ongoing, in, approximately, 1900, bc, ancient, iron, smelting, sites, existed, in, tamil, nadu, in, the, near, east, about, 3, 500, bc, it, was, discovered, that, by, combining, copper, and, tin, a, superior, metal, could, be, made, an, alloy, called, bronze, this, represented, a, major, technological, shift, known, as, the, bronze, age, the, extraction, of, iron, from, its, ore, into, a, workable, metal, is, much, more, difficult, than, for, copper, or, tin, the, process, appears, to, have, been, invented, by, the, hittites, in, about, 1200, bc, beginning, the, iron, age, the, secret, of, extracting, and, working, iron, was, a, key, factor, in, the, success, of, the, philistines, historical, developments, in, ferrous, metallurgy, can, be, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, past, cultures, and, civilizations, this, includes, the, ancient, and, medieval, kingdoms, and, empires, of, the, middle, east, and, near, east, ancient, iran, ancient, egypt, ancient, nubia, and, anatolia, in, present, day, turkey, ancient, nok, carthage, the, celts, greeks, and, romans, of, ancient, europe, medieval, europe, ancient, and, medieval, china, ancient, and, medieval, india, ancient, and, medieval, japan, amongst, others, a, 16th, century, book, by, georg, agricola, de, re, metallica, describes, the, highly, developed, and, complex, processes, of, mining, metal, ores, metal, extraction, and, metallurgy, of, the, time, agricola, has, been, described, as, the, father, of, metallurgy, extractive, metallurgy, is, the, practice, of, removing, valuable, metals, from, an, ore, and, refining, the, extracted, raw, metals, into, a, purer, form, in, order, to, convert, a, metal, oxide, or, sulphide, to, a, purer, metal, the, ore, must, be, reduced, physically, chemically, or, electrolytically, extractive, metallurgists, are, interested, in, three, primary, streams, feed, concentrate, metal, oxide, sulphide, and, tailings, waste, after, mining, large, pieces, of, the, ore, feed, are, broken, through, crushing, or, grinding, in, order, to, obtain, particles, small, enough, where, each, particle, is, either, mostly, valuable, or, mostly, waste, concentrating, the, particles, of, value, in, a, form, supporting, separation, enables, the, desired, metal, to, be, removed, from, waste, products, mining, may, not, be, necessary, if, the, ore, body, and, physical, environment, are, conducive, to, leaching, leaching, dissolves, minerals, in, an, ore, body, and, results, in, an, enriched, solution, the, solution, is, collected, and, processed, to, extract, valuable, metals, ore, bodies, often, contain, more, than, one, valuable, metal, tailings, of, a, previous, process, may, be, used, as, a, feed, in, another, process, to, extract, a, secondary, product, from, the, original, ore, additionally, a, concentrate, may, contain, more, than, one, valuable, metal, that, concentrate, would, then, be, processed, to, separate, the, valuable, metals, into, individual, constituents, much, effort, has, been, placed, on, understanding, iron, carbon, alloy, system, which, includes, steels, and, cast, irons, plain, carbon, steels, those, that, contain, essentially, only, carbon, as, an, alloying, element, are, used, in, low, cost, high, strength, applications, where, neither, weight, nor, corrosion, are, a, major, concern, cast, irons, including, ductile, iron, are, also, part, of, the, iron, carbon, system, iron, manganese, chromium, alloys, hadfield, type, steels, are, also, used, in, non, magnetic, applications, such, as, directional, drilling, other, engineering, metals, include, aluminium, chromium, copper, magnesium, nickel, titanium, zinc, and, silicon, these, metals, are, most, often, used, as, alloys, with, the, noted, exception, of, silicon, which, is, not, a, metal, other, forms, include, in, production, engineering, metallurgy, is, concerned, with, the, production, of, metallic, components, for, use, in, consumer, or, engineering, products, this, involves, production, of, alloys, shaping, heat, treatment, and, surface, treatment, of, product, the, task, of, the, metallurgist, is, to, achieve, balance, between, material, properties, such, as, cost, weight, strength, toughness, hardness, corrosion, fatigue, resistance, and, performance, in, temperature, extremes, to, achieve, this, goal, the, operating, environment, must, be, carefully, considered, determining, the, hardness, of, the, metal, using, the, rockwell, vickers, and, brinell, hardness, scales, is, a, commonly, used, practice, that, helps, better, understand, the, metal, s, elasticity, and, plasticity, for, different, applications, and, production, processes, in, a, saltwater, environment, most, ferrous, metals, and, some, non, ferrous, alloys, corrode, quickly, metals, exposed, to, cold, or, cryogenic, conditions, may, undergo, a, ductile, to, brittle, transition, and, lose, their, toughness, becoming, more, brittle, and, prone, to, cracking, metals, under, continual, cyclic, loading, can, suffer, from, metal, fatigue, metals, under, constant, stress, at, elevated, temperatures, can, creep, cold, working, processes, in, which, the, product, s, shape, is, altered, by, rolling, fabrication, or, other, processes, while, the, product, is, cold, can, increase, the, strength, of, the, product, by, a, process, called, work, hardening, work, hardening, creates, microscopic, defects, in, the, metal, which, resist, further, changes, of, shape, metals, can, be, heat, treated, to, alter, the, properties, of, strength, ductility, toughness, hardness, and, resistance, to, corrosion, common, heat, treatment, processes, include, annealing, precipitation, strengthening, quenching, and, tempering, often, mechanical, and, thermal, treatments, are, combined, in, what, are, known, as, thermo, mechanical, treatments, for, better, properties, and, more, efficient, processing, of, materials, these, processes, are, common, to, high, alloy, special, steels, superalloys, and, titanium, alloys, electroplating, is, a, chemical, surface, treatment, technique, it, involves, bonding, a, thin, layer, of, another, metal, such, as, gold, silver, chromium, or, zinc, to, the, surface, of, the, product, this, is, done, by, selecting, the, coating, material, electrolyte, solution, which, is, the, material, that, is, going, to, coat, the, workpiece, gold, silver, zinc, there, needs, to, be, two, electrodes, of, different, materials, one, the, same, material, as, the, coating, material, and, one, that, is, receiving, the, coating, material, two, electrodes, are, electrically, charged, and, the, coating, material, is, stuck, to, the, work, piece, it, is, used, to, reduce, corrosion, as, well, as, to, improve, the, product, s, aesthetic, appearance, it, is, also, used, to, make, inexpensive, metals, look, like, the, more, expensive, ones, gold, silver, shot, peening, is, a, cold, working, process, used, to, finish, metal, parts, in, the, process, of, shot, peening, small, round, shot, is, blasted, against, the, surface, of, the, part, to, be, finished, this, process, is, used, to, prolong, the, product, life, of, the, part, prevent, stress, corrosion, failures, and, also, prevent, fatigue, the, shot, leaves, small, dimples, on, the, surface, like, a, peen, hammer, does, which, cause, compression, stress, under, the, dimple, as, the, shot, media, strikes, the, material, over, and, over, it, forms, many, overlapping, dimples, throughout, the, piece, being, treated, the, compression, stress, in, the, surface, of, the, material, strengthens, the, part, and, makes, it, more, resistant, to, fatigue, failure, stress, failures, corrosion, failure, and, cracking, thermal, spraying, techniques, are, another, popular, finishing, option, and, often, have, better, high, temperature, properties, than, electroplated, coatings, thermal, spraying, also, known, as, a, spray, welding, process, is, an, industrial, coating, process, that, consists, of, a, heat, source, flame, or, other, and, a, coating, material, that, can, be, in, a, powder, or, wire, form, which, is, melted, then, sprayed, on, the, surface, of, the, material, being, treated, at, a, high, velocity, the, spray, treating, process, is, known, by, many, different, names, such, as, hvof, high, velocity, oxygen, fuel, plasma, spray, flame, spray, arc, spray, and, metalizing, electroless, deposition, ed, or, electroless, plating, is, defined, as, the, autocatalytic, process, through, which, metals, and, metal, alloys, are, deposited, onto, nonconductive, surfaces, these, nonconductive, surfaces, include, plastics, ceramics, and, glass, etc, which, can, then, become, decorative, anti, corrosive, and, conductive, depending, on, their, final, functions, electroless, deposition, is, a, chemical, processes, that, create, metal, coatings, on, various, materials, by, autocatalytic, chemical, reduction, of, metal, cations, in, a, liquid, bath, metallurgists, study, the, microscopic, and, macroscopic, structure, of, metals, using, metallography, a, technique, invented, by, henry, clifton, sorby, in, metallography, an, alloy, of, interest, is, ground, flat, and, polished, to, a, mirror, finish, the, sample, can, then, be, etched, to, reveal, the, microstructure, and, macrostructure, of, the, metal, the, sample, is, then, examined, in, an, optical, or, electron, microscope, and, the, image, contrast, provides, details, on, the, composition, mechanical, properties, and, processing, history, crystallography, often, using, diffraction, of, x, rays, or, electrons, is, another, valuable, tool, available, to, the, modern, metallurgist, crystallography, allows, identification, of, unknown, materials, and, reveals, the, crystal, structure, of, the, sample, quantitative, crystallography, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, amount, of, phases, present, as, well, as, the, degree, of, strain, to, which, a, sample, has, been, subjected
