computer, security, also, cybersecurity, digital, security, or, information, technology, it, security, is, the, protection, of, computer, software, systems, and, networks, from, threats, that, may, result, in, unauthorized, information, disclosure, theft, of, or, damage, to, hardware, software, or, data, as, well, as, from, the, disruption, or, misdirection, of, the, services, they, provide, the, field, is, significant, due, to, the, expanded, reliance, on, computer, systems, the, internet, and, wireless, network, standards, it, is, also, significant, due, to, the, growth, of, smart, devices, including, smartphones, televisions, and, the, various, devices, that, constitute, the, internet, of, things, iot, cybersecurity, is, one, of, the, most, significant, new, challenges, facing, the, contemporary, world, due, to, both, the, complexity, of, information, systems, and, the, societies, they, support, security, is, of, especially, high, importance, for, systems, that, govern, large, scale, systems, with, far, reaching, physical, effects, such, as, power, distribution, elections, and, finance, while, many, aspects, of, computer, security, involve, digital, security, such, as, electronic, passwords, and, encryption, physical, security, measures, such, as, metal, locks, are, still, used, to, prevent, unauthorized, tampering, it, security, is, not, a, perfect, subset, of, information, security, thus, does, not, fit, completely, into, the, security, convergence, schema, a, vulnerability, refers, to, a, flaw, in, the, structure, execution, functioning, or, internal, oversight, of, a, computer, or, system, that, compromises, its, security, most, of, the, vulnerabilities, that, have, been, discovered, are, documented, in, the, common, vulnerabilities, and, exposures, cve, database, an, exploitable, vulnerability, is, one, for, which, at, least, one, working, attack, or, exploit, exists, actors, maliciously, seeking, vulnerabilities, are, known, as, threats, vulnerabilities, can, be, researched, reverse, engineered, hunted, or, exploited, using, automated, tools, or, customized, scripts, various, people, or, parties, are, vulnerable, to, cyber, attacks, however, different, groups, are, likely, to, experience, different, types, of, attacks, more, than, others, in, april, 2023, the, united, kingdom, department, for, science, innovation, technology, released, a, report, on, cyber, attacks, over, the, last, 12, months, they, surveyed, 2, 263, uk, businesses, 1, 174, uk, registered, charities, and, 554, education, institutions, the, research, found, that, 32, of, businesses, and, 24, of, charities, overall, recall, any, breaches, or, attacks, from, the, last, 12, months, these, figures, were, much, higher, for, medium, businesses, 59, large, businesses, 69, and, high, income, charities, with, 500, 000, or, more, in, annual, income, 56, yet, although, medium, or, large, businesses, are, more, often, the, victims, since, larger, companies, have, generally, improved, their, security, over, the, last, decade, small, and, midsize, businesses, smbs, have, also, become, increasingly, vulnerable, as, they, often, do, not, have, advanced, tools, to, defend, the, business, smbs, are, most, likely, to, be, affected, by, malware, ransomware, phishing, man, in, the, middle, attacks, and, denial, of, service, dos, attacks, normal, internet, users, are, most, likely, to, be, affected, by, untargeted, cyberattacks, these, are, where, attackers, indiscriminately, target, as, many, devices, services, or, users, as, possible, they, do, this, using, techniques, that, take, advantage, of, the, openness, of, the, internet, these, strategies, mostly, include, phishing, ransomware, water, holing, and, scanning, to, secure, a, computer, system, it, is, important, to, understand, the, attacks, that, can, be, made, against, it, and, these, threats, can, typically, be, classified, into, one, of, the, following, categories, a, backdoor, in, a, computer, system, a, cryptosystem, or, an, algorithm, is, any, secret, method, of, bypassing, normal, authentication, or, security, controls, these, weaknesses, may, exist, for, many, reasons, including, original, design, or, poor, configuration, due, to, the, nature, of, backdoors, they, are, of, greater, concern, to, companies, and, databases, as, opposed, to, individuals, backdoors, may, be, added, by, an, authorized, party, to, allow, some, legitimate, access, or, by, an, attacker, for, malicious, reasons, criminals, often, use, malware, to, install, backdoors, giving, them, remote, administrative, access, to, a, system, once, they, have, access, cybercriminals, can, modify, files, steal, personal, information, install, unwanted, software, and, even, take, control, of, the, entire, computer, backdoors, can, be, very, hard, to, detect, and, are, usually, discovered, by, someone, who, has, access, to, the, application, source, code, or, intimate, knowledge, of, the, operating, system, of, the, computer, denial, of, service, attacks, dos, are, designed, to, make, a, machine, or, network, resource, unavailable, to, its, intended, users, attackers, can, deny, service, to, individual, victims, such, as, by, deliberately, entering, a, wrong, password, enough, consecutive, times, to, cause, the, victim, s, account, to, be, locked, or, they, may, overload, the, capabilities, of, a, machine, or, network, and, block, all, users, at, once, while, a, network, attack, from, a, single, ip, address, can, be, blocked, by, adding, a, new, firewall, rule, many, forms, of, distributed, denial, of, service, ddos, attacks, are, possible, where, the, attack, comes, from, a, large, number, of, points, in, this, case, defending, against, these, attacks, is, much, more, difficult, such, attacks, can, originate, from, the, zombie, computers, of, a, botnet, or, from, a, range, of, other, possible, techniques, including, distributed, reflective, denial, of, service, drdos, where, innocent, systems, are, fooled, into, sending, traffic, to, the, victim, with, such, attacks, the, amplification, factor, makes, the, attack, easier, for, the, attacker, because, they, have, to, use, little, bandwidth, themselves, to, understand, why, attackers, may, carry, out, these, attacks, see, the, attacker, motivation, section, a, direct, access, attack, is, when, an, unauthorized, user, an, attacker, gains, physical, access, to, a, computer, most, likely, to, directly, copy, data, from, it, or, steal, information, attackers, may, also, compromise, security, by, making, operating, system, modifications, installing, software, worms, keyloggers, covert, listening, devices, or, using, wireless, microphones, even, when, the, system, is, protected, by, standard, security, measures, these, may, be, bypassed, by, booting, another, operating, system, or, tool, from, a, cd, rom, or, other, bootable, media, disk, encryption, and, the, trusted, platform, module, standard, are, designed, to, prevent, these, attacks, direct, service, attackers, are, related, in, concept, to, direct, memory, attacks, which, allow, an, attacker, to, gain, direct, access, to, a, computer, s, memory, the, attacks, take, advantage, of, a, feature, of, modern, computers, that, allows, certain, devices, such, as, external, hard, drives, graphics, cards, or, network, cards, to, access, the, computer, s, memory, directly, eavesdropping, is, the, act, of, surreptitiously, listening, to, a, private, computer, conversation, communication, usually, between, hosts, on, a, network, it, typically, occurs, when, a, user, connects, to, a, network, where, traffic, is, not, secured, or, encrypted, and, sends, sensitive, business, data, to, a, colleague, which, when, listened, to, by, an, attacker, could, be, exploited, data, transmitted, across, an, open, network, allows, an, attacker, to, exploit, a, vulnerability, and, intercept, it, via, various, methods, unlike, malware, direct, access, attacks, or, other, forms, of, cyber, attacks, eavesdropping, attacks, are, unlikely, to, negatively, affect, the, performance, of, networks, or, devices, making, them, difficult, to, notice, in, fact, the, attacker, does, not, need, to, have, any, ongoing, connection, to, the, software, at, all, the, attacker, can, insert, the, software, onto, a, compromised, device, perhaps, by, direct, insertion, or, perhaps, by, a, virus, or, other, malware, and, then, come, back, some, time, later, to, retrieve, any, data, that, is, found, or, trigger, the, software, to, send, the, data, at, some, determined, time, using, a, virtual, private, network, vpn, which, encrypts, data, between, two, points, is, one, of, the, most, common, forms, of, protection, against, eavesdropping, using, the, best, form, of, encryption, possible, for, wireless, networks, is, best, practice, as, well, as, using, https, instead, of, an, unencrypted, http, programs, such, as, carnivore, and, narusinsight, have, been, used, by, the, federal, bureau, of, investigation, fbi, and, nsa, to, eavesdrop, on, the, systems, of, internet, service, providers, even, machines, that, operate, as, a, closed, system, i, e, with, no, contact, with, the, outside, world, can, be, eavesdropped, upon, by, monitoring, the, faint, electromagnetic, transmissions, generated, by, the, hardware, tempest, is, a, specification, by, the, nsa, referring, to, these, attacks, malicious, software, malware, is, any, software, code, or, computer, program, intentionally, written, to, harm, a, computer, system, or, its, users, once, present, on, a, computer, it, can, leak, sensitive, details, such, as, personal, information, business, information, and, passwords, can, give, control, of, the, system, to, the, attacker, and, can, corrupt, or, delete, data, permanently, another, type, of, malware, is, ransomware, which, is, when, malware, installs, itself, onto, a, victim, s, machine, encrypts, their, files, and, then, turns, around, and, demands, a, ransom, usually, in, bitcoin, to, return, that, data, to, the, user, types, of, malware, include, some, of, the, following, man, in, the, middle, attacks, mitm, involve, a, malicious, attacker, trying, to, intercept, surveil, or, modify, communications, between, two, parties, by, spoofing, one, or, both, party, s, identities, and, injecting, themselves, in, between, types, of, mitm, attacks, include, surfacing, in, 2017, a, new, class, of, multi, vector, polymorphic, cyber, threats, combine, several, types, of, attacks, and, change, form, to, avoid, cybersecurity, controls, as, they, spread, multi, vector, polymorphic, attacks, as, the, name, describes, are, both, multi, vectored, and, polymorphic, firstly, they, are, a, singular, attack, that, involves, multiple, methods, of, attack, in, this, sense, they, are, multi, vectored, i, e, the, attack, can, use, multiple, means, of, propagation, such, as, via, the, web, email, and, applications, however, they, are, also, multi, staged, meaning, that, they, can, infiltrate, networks, and, move, laterally, inside, the, network, the, attacks, can, be, polymorphic, meaning, that, the, cyberattacks, used, such, as, viruses, worms, or, trojans, constantly, change, morph, making, it, nearly, impossible, to, detect, them, using, signature, based, defences, phishing, is, the, attempt, of, acquiring, sensitive, information, such, as, usernames, passwords, and, credit, card, details, directly, from, users, by, deceiving, the, users, phishing, is, typically, carried, out, by, email, spoofing, instant, messaging, text, message, or, on, a, phone, call, they, often, direct, users, to, enter, details, at, a, fake, website, whose, look, and, feel, are, almost, identical, to, the, legitimate, one, the, fake, website, often, asks, for, personal, information, such, as, login, details, and, passwords, this, information, can, then, be, used, to, gain, access, to, the, individual, s, real, account, on, the, real, website, preying, on, a, victim, s, trust, phishing, can, be, classified, as, a, form, of, social, engineering, attackers, can, use, creative, ways, to, gain, access, to, real, accounts, a, common, scam, is, for, attackers, to, send, fake, electronic, invoices, to, individuals, showing, that, they, recently, purchased, music, apps, or, others, and, instructing, them, to, click, on, a, link, if, the, purchases, were, not, authorized, a, more, strategic, type, of, phishing, is, spear, phishing, which, leverages, personal, or, organization, specific, details, to, make, the, attacker, appear, like, a, trusted, source, spear, phishing, attacks, target, specific, individuals, rather, than, the, broad, net, cast, by, phishing, attempts, privilege, escalation, describes, a, situation, where, an, attacker, with, some, level, of, restricted, access, is, able, to, without, authorization, elevate, their, privileges, or, access, level, for, example, a, standard, computer, user, may, be, able, to, exploit, a, vulnerability, in, the, system, to, gain, access, to, restricted, data, or, even, become, root, and, have, full, unrestricted, access, to, a, system, the, severity, of, attacks, can, range, from, attacks, simply, sending, an, unsolicited, email, to, a, ransomware, attack, on, large, amounts, of, data, privilege, escalation, usually, starts, with, social, engineering, techniques, often, phishing, privilege, escalation, can, be, separated, into, two, strategies, horizontal, and, vertical, privilege, escalation, any, computational, system, affects, its, environment, in, some, form, this, effect, it, has, on, its, environment, can, range, from, electromagnetic, radiation, to, residual, effect, on, ram, cells, which, as, a, consequence, make, a, cold, boot, attack, possible, to, hardware, implementation, faults, that, allow, for, access, or, guessing, of, other, values, that, normally, should, be, inaccessible, in, side, channel, attack, scenarios, the, attacker, would, gather, such, information, about, a, system, or, network, to, guess, its, internal, state, and, as, a, result, access, the, information, which, is, assumed, by, the, victim, to, be, secure, social, engineering, in, the, context, of, computer, security, aims, to, convince, a, user, to, disclose, secrets, such, as, passwords, card, numbers, etc, or, grant, physical, access, by, for, example, impersonating, a, senior, executive, bank, a, contractor, or, a, customer, this, generally, involves, exploiting, people, s, trust, and, relying, on, their, cognitive, biases, a, common, scam, involves, emails, sent, to, accounting, and, finance, department, personnel, impersonating, their, ceo, and, urgently, requesting, some, action, one, of, the, main, techniques, of, social, engineering, are, phishing, attacks, in, early, 2016, the, fbi, reported, that, such, business, email, compromise, bec, scams, had, cost, us, businesses, more, than, 2, billion, in, about, two, years, in, may, 2016, the, milwaukee, bucks, nba, team, was, the, victim, of, this, type, of, cyber, scam, with, a, perpetrator, impersonating, the, team, s, president, peter, feigin, resulting, in, the, handover, of, all, the, team, s, employees, 2015, w, 2, tax, forms, spoofing, is, an, act, of, pretending, to, be, a, valid, entity, through, the, falsification, of, data, such, as, an, ip, address, or, username, in, order, to, gain, access, to, information, or, resources, that, one, is, otherwise, unauthorized, to, obtain, spoofing, is, closely, related, to, phishing, there, are, several, types, of, spoofing, including, in, 2018, the, cybersecurity, firm, trellix, published, research, on, the, life, threatening, risk, of, spoofing, in, the, healthcare, industry, tampering, describes, a, malicious, modification, or, alteration, of, data, it, is, an, intentional, but, unauthorized, act, resulting, in, the, modification, of, a, system, components, of, systems, its, intended, behavior, or, data, so, called, evil, maid, attacks, and, security, services, planting, of, surveillance, capability, into, routers, are, examples, html, smuggling, allows, an, attacker, to, smuggle, a, malicious, code, inside, a, particular, html, or, web, page, html, files, can, carry, payloads, concealed, as, benign, inert, data, in, order, to, defeat, content, filters, these, payloads, can, be, reconstructed, on, the, other, side, of, the, filter, when, a, target, user, opens, the, html, the, malicious, code, is, activated, the, web, browser, then, decodes, the, script, which, then, unleashes, the, malware, onto, the, target, s, device, employee, behavior, can, have, a, big, impact, on, information, security, in, organizations, cultural, concepts, can, help, different, segments, of, the, organization, work, effectively, or, work, against, effectiveness, toward, information, security, within, an, organization, information, security, culture, is, the, totality, of, patterns, of, behavior, in, an, organization, that, contributes, to, the, protection, of, information, of, all, kinds, andersson, and, reimers, 2014, found, that, employees, often, do, not, see, themselves, as, part, of, their, organization, s, information, security, effort, and, often, take, actions, that, impede, organizational, changes, indeed, the, verizon, data, breach, investigations, report, 2020, which, examined, 3, 950, security, breaches, discovered, 30, of, cybersecurity, incidents, involved, internal, actors, within, a, company, research, shows, information, security, culture, needs, to, be, improved, continuously, in, information, security, culture, from, analysis, to, change, authors, commented, it, s, a, never, ending, process, a, cycle, of, evaluation, and, change, or, maintenance, to, manage, the, information, security, culture, five, steps, should, be, taken, pre, evaluation, strategic, planning, operative, planning, implementation, and, post, evaluation, in, computer, security, a, countermeasure, is, an, action, device, procedure, or, technique, that, reduces, a, threat, a, vulnerability, or, an, attack, by, eliminating, or, preventing, it, by, minimizing, the, harm, it, can, cause, or, by, discovering, and, reporting, it, so, that, corrective, action, can, be, taken, some, common, countermeasures, are, listed, in, the, following, sections, security, by, design, or, alternately, secure, by, design, means, that, the, software, has, been, designed, from, the, ground, up, to, be, secure, in, this, case, security, is, considered, a, main, feature, the, uk, government, s, national, cyber, security, centre, separates, secure, cyber, design, principles, into, five, sections, these, design, principles, of, security, by, design, can, include, some, of, the, following, techniques, security, architecture, can, be, defined, as, the, practice, of, designing, computer, systems, to, achieve, security, goals, these, goals, have, overlap, with, the, principles, of, security, by, design, explored, above, including, to, make, initial, compromise, of, the, system, difficult, and, to, limit, the, impact, of, any, compromise, in, practice, the, role, of, a, security, architect, would, be, to, ensure, the, structure, of, a, system, reinforces, the, security, of, the, system, and, that, new, changes, are, safe, and, meet, the, security, requirements, of, the, organization, similarly, techopedia, defines, security, architecture, as, a, unified, security, design, that, addresses, the, necessities, and, potential, risks, involved, in, a, certain, scenario, or, environment, it, also, specifies, when, and, where, to, apply, security, controls, the, design, process, is, generally, reproducible, the, key, attributes, of, security, architecture, are, practicing, security, architecture, provides, the, right, foundation, to, systematically, address, business, it, and, security, concerns, in, an, organization, a, state, of, computer, security, is, the, conceptual, ideal, attained, by, the, use, of, three, processes, threat, prevention, detection, and, response, these, processes, are, based, on, various, policies, and, system, components, which, include, the, following, today, computer, security, consists, mainly, of, preventive, measures, like, firewalls, or, an, exit, procedure, a, firewall, can, be, defined, as, a, way, of, filtering, network, data, between, a, host, or, a, network, and, another, network, such, as, the, internet, they, can, be, implemented, as, software, running, on, the, machine, hooking, into, the, network, stack, or, in, the, case, of, most, unix, based, operating, systems, such, as, linux, built, into, the, operating, system, kernel, to, provide, real, time, filtering, and, blocking, another, implementation, is, a, so, called, physical, firewall, which, consists, of, a, separate, machine, filtering, network, traffic, firewalls, are, common, amongst, machines, that, are, permanently, connected, to, the, internet, some, organizations, are, turning, to, big, data, platforms, such, as, apache, hadoop, to, extend, data, accessibility, and, machine, learning, to, detect, advanced, persistent, threats, in, order, to, ensure, adequate, security, the, confidentiality, integrity, and, availability, of, a, network, better, known, as, the, cia, triad, must, be, protected, and, is, considered, the, foundation, to, information, security, to, achieve, those, objectives, administrative, physical, and, technical, security, measures, should, be, employed, the, amount, of, security, afforded, to, an, asset, can, only, be, determined, when, its, value, is, known, vulnerability, management, is, the, cycle, of, identifying, fixing, or, mitigating, vulnerabilities, especially, in, software, and, firmware, vulnerability, management, is, integral, to, computer, security, and, network, security, vulnerabilities, can, be, discovered, with, a, vulnerability, scanner, which, analyzes, a, computer, system, in, search, of, known, vulnerabilities, such, as, open, ports, insecure, software, configuration, and, susceptibility, to, malware, in, order, for, these, tools, to, be, effective, they, must, be, kept, up, to, date, with, every, new, update, the, vendor, release, typically, these, updates, will, scan, for, the, new, vulnerabilities, that, were, introduced, recently, beyond, vulnerability, scanning, many, organizations, contract, outside, security, auditors, to, run, regular, penetration, tests, against, their, systems, to, identify, vulnerabilities, in, some, sectors, this, is, a, contractual, requirement, the, act, of, assessing, and, reducing, vulnerabilities, to, cyber, attacks, is, commonly, referred, to, as, information, technology, security, assessments, they, aim, to, assess, systems, for, risk, and, to, predict, and, test, for, their, vulnerabilities, while, formal, verification, of, the, correctness, of, computer, systems, is, possible, it, is, not, yet, common, operating, systems, formally, verified, include, sel4, and, sysgo, s, pikeos, but, these, make, up, a, very, small, percentage, of, the, market, it, is, possible, to, reduce, an, attacker, s, chances, by, keeping, systems, up, to, date, with, security, patches, and, updates, and, by, hiring, people, with, expertise, in, security, large, companies, with, significant, threats, can, hire, security, operations, centre, soc, analysts, these, are, specialists, in, cyber, defences, with, their, role, ranging, from, conducting, threat, analysis, to, investigating, reports, of, any, new, issues, and, preparing, and, testing, disaster, recovery, plans, whilst, no, measures, can, completely, guarantee, the, prevention, of, an, attack, these, measures, can, help, mitigate, the, damage, of, possible, attacks, the, effects, of, data, loss, damage, can, be, also, reduced, by, careful, backing, up, and, insurance, outside, of, formal, assessments, there, are, various, methods, of, reducing, vulnerabilities, two, factor, authentication, is, a, method, for, mitigating, unauthorized, access, to, a, system, or, sensitive, information, it, requires, something, you, know, a, password, or, pin, and, something, you, have, a, card, dongle, cellphone, or, another, piece, of, hardware, this, increases, security, as, an, unauthorized, person, needs, both, of, these, to, gain, access, protecting, against, social, engineering, and, direct, computer, access, physical, attacks, can, only, happen, by, non, computer, means, which, can, be, difficult, to, enforce, relative, to, the, sensitivity, of, the, information, training, is, often, involved, to, help, mitigate, this, risk, by, improving, people, s, knowledge, of, how, to, protect, themselves, and, by, increasing, people, s, awareness, of, threats, however, even, in, highly, disciplined, environments, e, g, military, organizations, social, engineering, attacks, can, still, be, difficult, to, foresee, and, prevent, inoculation, derived, from, inoculation, theory, seeks, to, prevent, social, engineering, and, other, fraudulent, tricks, and, traps, by, instilling, a, resistance, to, persuasion, attempts, through, exposure, to, similar, or, related, attempts, hardware, based, or, assisted, computer, security, also, offers, an, alternative, to, software, only, computer, security, using, devices, and, methods, such, as, dongles, trusted, platform, modules, intrusion, aware, cases, drive, locks, disabling, usb, ports, and, mobile, enabled, access, may, be, considered, more, secure, due, to, the, physical, access, or, sophisticated, backdoor, access, required, in, order, to, be, compromised, each, of, these, is, covered, in, more, detail, below, one, use, of, the, term, computer, security, refers, to, technology, that, is, used, to, implement, secure, operating, systems, using, secure, operating, systems, is, a, good, way, of, ensuring, computer, security, these, are, systems, that, have, achieved, certification, from, an, external, security, auditing, organization, the, most, popular, evaluations, are, common, criteria, cc, in, software, engineering, secure, coding, aims, to, guard, against, the, accidental, introduction, of, security, vulnerabilities, it, is, also, possible, to, create, software, designed, from, the, ground, up, to, be, secure, such, systems, are, secure, by, design, beyond, this, formal, verification, aims, to, prove, the, correctness, of, the, algorithms, underlying, a, system, important, for, cryptographic, protocols, for, example, within, computer, systems, two, of, the, main, security, models, capable, of, enforcing, privilege, separation, are, access, control, lists, acls, and, role, based, access, control, rbac, an, access, control, list, acl, with, respect, to, a, computer, file, system, is, a, list, of, permissions, associated, with, an, object, an, acl, specifies, which, users, or, system, processes, are, granted, access, to, objects, as, well, as, what, operations, are, allowed, on, given, objects, role, based, access, control, is, an, approach, to, restricting, system, access, to, authorized, users, used, by, the, majority, of, enterprises, with, more, than, 500, employees, and, can, implement, mandatory, access, control, mac, or, discretionary, access, control, dac, a, further, approach, capability, based, security, has, been, mostly, restricted, to, research, operating, systems, capabilities, can, however, also, be, implemented, at, the, language, level, leading, to, a, style, of, programming, that, is, essentially, a, refinement, of, standard, object, oriented, design, an, open, source, project, in, the, area, is, the, e, language, the, end, user, is, widely, recognized, as, the, weakest, link, in, the, security, chain, and, it, is, estimated, that, more, than, 90, of, security, incidents, and, breaches, involve, some, kind, of, human, error, among, the, most, commonly, recorded, forms, of, errors, and, misjudgment, are, poor, password, management, sending, emails, containing, sensitive, data, and, attachments, to, the, wrong, recipient, the, inability, to, recognize, misleading, urls, and, to, identify, fake, websites, and, dangerous, email, attachments, a, common, mistake, that, users, make, is, saving, their, user, id, password, in, their, browsers, to, make, it, easier, to, log, in, to, banking, sites, this, is, a, gift, to, attackers, who, have, obtained, access, to, a, machine, by, some, means, the, risk, may, be, mitigated, by, the, use, of, two, factor, authentication, as, the, human, component, of, cyber, risk, is, particularly, relevant, in, determining, the, global, cyber, risk, an, organization, is, facing, security, awareness, training, at, all, levels, not, only, provides, formal, compliance, with, regulatory, and, industry, mandates, but, is, considered, essential, in, reducing, cyber, risk, and, protecting, individuals, and, companies, from, the, great, majority, of, cyber, threats, the, focus, on, the, end, user, represents, a, profound, cultural, change, for, many, security, practitioners, who, have, traditionally, approached, cybersecurity, exclusively, from, a, technical, perspective, and, moves, along, the, lines, suggested, by, major, security, centers, to, develop, a, culture, of, cyber, awareness, within, the, organization, recognizing, that, a, security, aware, user, provides, an, important, line, of, defense, against, cyber, attacks, related, to, end, user, training, digital, hygiene, or, cyber, hygiene, is, a, fundamental, principle, relating, to, information, security, and, as, the, analogy, with, personal, hygiene, shows, is, the, equivalent, of, establishing, simple, routine, measures, to, minimize, the, risks, from, cyber, threats, the, assumption, is, that, good, cyber, hygiene, practices, can, give, networked, users, another, layer, of, protection, reducing, the, risk, that, one, vulnerable, node, will, be, used, to, either, mount, attacks, or, compromise, another, node, or, network, especially, from, common, cyberattacks, cyber, hygiene, should, also, not, be, mistaken, for, proactive, cyber, defence, a, military, term, the, most, common, acts, of, digital, hygiene, can, include, updating, malware, protection, cloud, back, ups, passwords, and, ensuring, restricted, admin, rights, and, network, firewalls, as, opposed, to, a, purely, technology, based, defense, against, threats, cyber, hygiene, mostly, regards, routine, measures, that, are, technically, simple, to, implement, and, mostly, dependent, on, discipline, or, education, it, can, be, thought, of, as, an, abstract, list, of, tips, or, measures, that, have, been, demonstrated, as, having, a, positive, effect, on, personal, or, collective, digital, security, as, such, these, measures, can, be, performed, by, laypeople, not, just, security, experts, cyber, hygiene, relates, to, personal, hygiene, as, computer, viruses, relate, to, biological, viruses, or, pathogens, however, while, the, term, computer, virus, was, coined, almost, simultaneously, with, the, creation, of, the, first, working, computer, viruses, the, term, cyber, hygiene, is, a, much, later, invention, perhaps, as, late, as, 2000, by, internet, pioneer, vint, cerf, it, has, since, been, adopted, by, the, congress, and, senate, of, the, united, states, the, fbi, eu, institutions, and, heads, of, state, responding, to, attempted, security, breaches, is, often, very, difficult, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, where, an, attack, succeeds, and, a, breach, occurs, many, jurisdictions, now, have, in, place, mandatory, security, breach, notification, laws, the, growth, in, the, number, of, computer, systems, and, the, increasing, reliance, upon, them, by, individuals, businesses, industries, and, governments, means, that, there, are, an, increasing, number, of, systems, at, risk, the, computer, systems, of, financial, regulators, and, financial, institutions, like, the, u, s, securities, and, exchange, commission, swift, investment, banks, and, commercial, banks, are, prominent, hacking, targets, for, cybercriminals, interested, in, manipulating, markets, and, making, illicit, gains, websites, and, apps, that, accept, or, store, credit, card, numbers, brokerage, accounts, and, bank, account, information, are, also, prominent, hacking, targets, because, of, the, potential, for, immediate, financial, gain, from, transferring, money, making, purchases, or, selling, the, information, on, the, black, market, in, store, payment, systems, and, atms, have, also, been, tampered, with, in, order, to, gather, customer, account, data, and, pins, the, ucla, internet, report, surveying, the, digital, future, 2000, found, that, the, privacy, of, personal, data, created, barriers, to, online, sales, and, that, more, than, nine, out, of, 10, internet, users, were, somewhat, or, very, concerned, about, credit, card, security, the, most, common, web, technologies, for, improving, security, between, browsers, and, websites, are, named, ssl, secure, sockets, layer, and, its, successor, tls, transport, layer, security, identity, management, and, authentication, services, and, domain, name, services, allow, companies, and, consumers, to, engage, in, secure, communications, and, commerce, several, versions, of, ssl, and, tls, are, commonly, used, today, in, applications, such, as, web, browsing, e, mail, internet, faxing, instant, messaging, and, voip, voice, over, ip, there, are, various, interoperable, implementations, of, these, technologies, including, at, least, one, implementation, that, is, open, source, open, source, allows, anyone, to, view, the, application, s, source, code, and, look, for, and, report, vulnerabilities, the, credit, card, companies, visa, and, mastercard, cooperated, to, develop, the, secure, emv, chip, which, is, embedded, in, credit, cards, further, developments, include, the, chip, authentication, program, where, banks, give, customers, hand, held, card, readers, to, perform, online, secure, transactions, other, developments, in, this, arena, include, the, development, of, technology, such, as, instant, issuance, which, has, enabled, shopping, mall, kiosks, acting, on, behalf, of, banks, to, issue, on, the, spot, credit, cards, to, interested, customers, computers, control, functions, at, many, utilities, including, coordination, of, telecommunications, the, power, grid, nuclear, power, plants, and, valve, opening, and, closing, in, water, and, gas, networks, the, internet, is, a, potential, attack, vector, for, such, machines, if, connected, but, the, stuxnet, worm, demonstrated, that, even, equipment, controlled, by, computers, not, connected, to, the, internet, can, be, vulnerable, in, 2014, the, computer, emergency, readiness, team, a, division, of, the, department, of, homeland, security, investigated, 79, hacking, incidents, at, energy, companies, the, aviation, industry, is, very, reliant, on, a, series, of, complex, systems, which, could, be, attacked, a, simple, power, outage, at, one, airport, can, cause, repercussions, worldwide, much, of, the, system, relies, on, radio, transmissions, which, could, be, disrupted, and, controlling, aircraft, over, oceans, is, especially, dangerous, because, radar, surveillance, only, extends, 175, to, 225, miles, offshore, there, is, also, potential, for, attack, from, within, an, aircraft, implementing, fixes, in, aerospace, systems, poses, a, unique, challenge, because, efficient, air, transportation, is, heavily, affected, by, weight, and, volume, improving, security, by, adding, physical, devices, to, airplanes, could, increase, their, unloaded, weight, and, could, potentially, reduce, cargo, or, passenger, capacity, in, europe, with, the, pan, european, network, service, and, newpens, and, in, the, us, with, the, nextgen, program, air, navigation, service, providers, are, moving, to, create, their, own, dedicated, networks, many, modern, passports, are, now, biometric, passports, containing, an, embedded, microchip, that, stores, a, digitized, photograph, and, personal, information, such, as, name, gender, and, date, of, birth, in, addition, more, countries, are, introducing, facial, recognition, technology, to, reduce, identity, related, fraud, the, introduction, of, the, epassport, has, assisted, border, officials, in, verifying, the, identity, of, the, passport, holder, thus, allowing, for, quick, passenger, processing, plans, are, under, way, in, the, us, the, uk, and, australia, to, introduce, smartgate, kiosks, with, both, retina, and, fingerprint, recognition, technology, the, airline, industry, is, moving, from, the, use, of, traditional, paper, tickets, towards, the, use, of, electronic, tickets, e, tickets, these, have, been, made, possible, by, advances, in, online, credit, card, transactions, in, partnership, with, the, airlines, long, distance, bus, companies, are, also, switching, over, to, e, ticketing, transactions, today, the, consequences, of, a, successful, attack, range, from, loss, of, confidentiality, to, loss, of, system, integrity, air, traffic, control, outages, loss, of, aircraft, and, even, loss, of, life, desktop, computers, and, laptops, are, commonly, targeted, to, gather, passwords, or, financial, account, information, or, to, construct, a, botnet, to, attack, another, target, smartphones, tablet, computers, smart, watches, and, other, mobile, devices, such, as, quantified, self, devices, like, activity, trackers, have, sensors, such, as, cameras, microphones, gps, receivers, compasses, and, accelerometers, which, could, be, exploited, and, may, collect, personal, information, including, sensitive, health, information, wifi, bluetooth, and, cell, phone, networks, on, any, of, these, devices, could, be, used, as, attack, vectors, and, sensors, might, be, remotely, activated, after, a, successful, breach, the, increasing, number, of, home, automation, devices, such, as, the, nest, thermostat, are, also, potential, targets, today, many, healthcare, providers, and, health, insurance, companies, use, the, internet, to, provide, enhanced, products, and, services, for, example, through, use, of, tele, health, to, potentially, offer, better, quality, and, access, to, healthcare, or, fitness, trackers, to, lower, insurance, premiums, the, health, care, company, humana, partners, with, webmd, oracle, corporation, eds, and, microsoft, to, enable, its, members, to, access, their, health, care, records, as, well, as, to, provide, an, overview, of, health, care, plans, patient, records, are, increasingly, being, placed, on, secure, in, house, networks, alleviating, the, need, for, extra, storage, space, large, corporations, are, common, targets, in, many, cases, attacks, are, aimed, at, financial, gain, through, identity, theft, and, involve, data, breaches, examples, include, the, loss, of, millions, of, clients, credit, card, and, financial, details, by, home, depot, staples, target, corporation, and, equifax, medical, records, have, been, targeted, in, general, identify, theft, health, insurance, fraud, and, impersonating, patients, to, obtain, prescription, drugs, for, recreational, purposes, or, resale, although, cyber, threats, continue, to, increase, 62, of, all, organizations, did, not, increase, security, training, for, their, business, in, 2015, not, all, attacks, are, financially, motivated, however, security, firm, hbgary, federal, had, a, serious, series, of, attacks, in, 2011, from, hacktivist, group, anonymous, in, retaliation, for, the, firm, s, ceo, claiming, to, have, infiltrated, their, group, and, sony, pictures, was, hacked, in, 2014, with, the, apparent, dual, motive, of, embarrassing, the, company, through, data, leaks, and, crippling, the, company, by, wiping, workstations, and, servers, vehicles, are, increasingly, computerized, with, engine, timing, cruise, control, anti, lock, brakes, seat, belt, tensioners, door, locks, airbags, and, advanced, driver, assistance, systems, on, many, models, additionally, connected, cars, may, use, wifi, and, bluetooth, to, communicate, with, onboard, consumer, devices, and, the, cell, phone, network, self, driving, cars, are, expected, to, be, even, more, complex, all, of, these, systems, carry, some, security, risks, and, such, issues, have, gained, wide, attention, simple, examples, of, risk, include, a, malicious, compact, disc, being, used, as, an, attack, vector, and, the, car, s, onboard, microphones, being, used, for, eavesdropping, however, if, access, is, gained, to, a, car, s, internal, controller, area, network, the, danger, is, much, greater, and, in, a, widely, publicized, 2015, test, hackers, remotely, carjacked, a, vehicle, from, 10, miles, away, and, drove, it, into, a, ditch, manufacturers, are, reacting, in, numerous, ways, with, tesla, in, 2016, pushing, out, some, security, fixes, over, the, air, into, its, cars, computer, systems, in, the, area, of, autonomous, vehicles, in, september, 2016, the, united, states, department, of, transportation, announced, some, initial, safety, standards, and, called, for, states, to, come, up, with, uniform, policies, additionally, e, drivers, licenses, are, being, developed, using, the, same, technology, for, example, mexico, s, licensing, authority, icv, has, used, a, smart, card, platform, to, issue, the, first, e, drivers, licenses, to, the, city, of, monterrey, in, the, state, of, nuevo, le, n, shipping, companies, have, adopted, rfid, radio, frequency, identification, technology, as, an, efficient, digitally, secure, tracking, device, unlike, a, barcode, rfid, can, be, read, up, to, 20, feet, away, rfid, is, used, by, fedex, and, ups, government, and, military, computer, systems, are, commonly, attacked, by, activists, and, foreign, powers, local, and, regional, government, infrastructure, such, as, traffic, light, controls, police, and, intelligence, agency, communications, personnel, records, as, well, as, student, records, the, fbi, cia, and, pentagon, all, utilize, secure, controlled, access, technology, for, any, of, their, buildings, however, the, use, of, this, form, of, technology, is, spreading, into, the, entrepreneurial, world, more, and, more, companies, are, taking, advantage, of, the, development, of, digitally, secure, controlled, access, technology, ge, s, acuvision, for, example, offers, a, single, panel, platform, for, access, control, alarm, monitoring, and, digital, recording, the, internet, of, things, iot, is, the, network, of, physical, objects, such, as, devices, vehicles, and, buildings, that, are, embedded, with, electronics, software, sensors, and, network, connectivity, that, enables, them, to, collect, and, exchange, data, concerns, have, been, raised, that, this, is, being, developed, without, appropriate, consideration, of, the, security, challenges, involved, while, the, iot, creates, opportunities, for, more, direct, integration, of, the, physical, world, into, computer, based, systems, it, also, provides, opportunities, for, misuse, in, particular, as, the, internet, of, things, spreads, widely, cyberattacks, are, likely, to, become, an, increasingly, physical, rather, than, simply, virtual, threat, if, a, front, door, s, lock, is, connected, to, the, internet, and, can, be, locked, unlocked, from, a, phone, then, a, criminal, could, enter, the, home, at, the, press, of, a, button, from, a, stolen, or, hacked, phone, people, could, stand, to, lose, much, more, than, their, credit, card, numbers, in, a, world, controlled, by, iot, enabled, devices, thieves, have, also, used, electronic, means, to, circumvent, non, internet, connected, hotel, door, locks, an, attack, aimed, at, physical, infrastructure, or, human, lives, is, often, called, a, cyber, kinetic, attack, as, iot, devices, and, appliances, become, more, widespread, the, prevalence, and, potential, damage, of, cyber, kinetic, attacks, can, increase, substantially, medical, devices, have, either, been, successfully, attacked, or, had, potentially, deadly, vulnerabilities, demonstrated, including, both, in, hospital, diagnostic, equipment, and, implanted, devices, including, pacemakers, and, insulin, pumps, there, are, many, reports, of, hospitals, and, hospital, organizations, getting, hacked, including, ransomware, attacks, windows, xp, exploits, viruses, and, data, breaches, of, sensitive, data, stored, on, hospital, servers, on, 28, december, 2016, the, us, food, and, drug, administration, released, its, recommendations, for, how, medical, device, manufacturers, should, maintain, the, security, of, internet, connected, devices, but, no, structure, for, enforcement, in, distributed, generation, systems, the, risk, of, a, cyber, attack, is, real, according, to, daily, energy, insider, an, attack, could, cause, a, loss, of, power, in, a, large, area, for, a, long, period, of, time, and, such, an, attack, could, have, just, as, severe, consequences, as, a, natural, disaster, the, district, of, columbia, is, considering, creating, a, distributed, energy, resources, der, authority, within, the, city, with, the, goal, being, for, customers, to, have, more, insight, into, their, own, energy, use, and, giving, the, local, electric, utility, pepco, the, chance, to, better, estimate, energy, demand, the, d, c, proposal, however, would, allow, third, party, vendors, to, create, numerous, points, of, energy, distribution, which, could, potentially, create, more, opportunities, for, cyber, attackers, to, threaten, the, electric, grid, perhaps, the, most, widely, known, digitally, secure, telecommunication, device, is, the, sim, subscriber, identity, module, card, a, device, that, is, embedded, in, most, of, the, world, s, cellular, devices, before, any, service, can, be, obtained, the, sim, card, is, just, the, beginning, of, this, digitally, secure, environment, the, smart, card, web, servers, draft, standard, scws, defines, the, interfaces, to, an, http, server, in, a, smart, card, tests, are, being, conducted, to, secure, ota, over, the, air, payment, and, credit, card, information, from, and, to, a, mobile, phone, combination, sim, dvd, devices, are, being, developed, through, smart, video, card, technology, which, embeds, a, dvd, compliant, optical, disc, into, the, card, body, of, a, regular, sim, card, other, telecommunication, developments, involving, digital, security, include, mobile, signatures, which, use, the, embedded, sim, card, to, generate, a, legally, binding, electronic, signature, serious, financial, damage, has, been, caused, by, security, breaches, but, because, there, is, no, standard, model, for, estimating, the, cost, of, an, incident, the, only, data, available, is, that, which, is, made, public, by, the, organizations, involved, several, computer, security, consulting, firms, produce, estimates, of, total, worldwide, losses, attributable, to, virus, and, worm, attacks, and, to, hostile, digital, acts, in, general, the, 2003, loss, estimates, by, these, firms, range, from, 13, billion, worms, and, viruses, only, to, 226, billion, for, all, forms, of, covert, attacks, the, reliability, of, these, estimates, is, often, challenged, the, underlying, methodology, is, basically, anecdotal, however, reasonable, estimates, of, the, financial, cost, of, security, breaches, can, actually, help, organizations, make, rational, investment, decisions, according, to, the, classic, gordon, loeb, model, analyzing, the, optimal, investment, level, in, information, security, one, can, conclude, that, the, amount, a, firm, spends, to, protect, information, should, generally, be, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, expected, loss, i, e, the, expected, value, of, the, loss, resulting, from, a, cyber, information, security, breach, as, with, physical, security, the, motivations, for, breaches, of, computer, security, vary, between, attackers, some, are, thrill, seekers, or, vandals, some, are, activists, others, are, criminals, looking, for, financial, gain, state, sponsored, attackers, are, now, common, and, well, resourced, but, started, with, amateurs, such, as, markus, hess, who, hacked, for, the, kgb, as, recounted, by, clifford, stoll, in, the, cuckoo, s, egg, attackers, motivations, can, vary, for, all, types, of, attacks, from, pleasure, to, political, goals, for, example, hacktivists, may, target, a, company, or, organization, that, carries, out, activities, they, do, not, agree, with, this, would, be, to, create, bad, publicity, for, the, company, by, having, its, website, crash, high, capability, hackers, often, with, larger, backing, or, state, sponsorship, may, attack, based, on, the, demands, of, their, financial, backers, these, attacks, are, more, likely, to, attempt, more, serious, attack, an, example, of, a, more, serious, attack, was, the, 2015, ukraine, power, grid, hack, which, reportedly, utilised, the, spear, phising, destruction, of, files, and, denial, of, service, attacks, to, carry, out, the, full, attack, additionally, recent, attacker, motivations, can, be, traced, back, to, extremist, organizations, seeking, to, gain, political, advantage, or, disrupt, social, agendas, the, growth, of, the, internet, mobile, technologies, and, inexpensive, computing, devices, have, led, to, a, rise, in, capabilities, but, also, to, the, risk, to, environments, that, are, deemed, as, vital, to, operations, all, critical, targeted, environments, are, susceptible, to, compromise, and, this, has, led, to, a, series, of, proactive, studies, on, how, to, migrate, the, risk, by, taking, into, consideration, motivations, by, these, types, of, actors, several, stark, differences, exist, between, the, hacker, motivation, and, that, of, nation, state, actors, seeking, to, attack, based, on, an, ideological, preference, a, key, aspect, of, threat, modeling, for, any, system, is, identifying, the, motivations, behind, potential, attacks, and, the, individuals, or, groups, likely, to, carry, them, out, the, level, and, detail, of, security, measures, will, differ, based, on, the, specific, system, being, protected, for, instance, a, home, personal, computer, a, bank, and, a, classified, military, network, each, face, distinct, threats, despite, using, similar, underlying, technologies, computer, security, incident, management, is, an, organized, approach, to, addressing, and, managing, the, aftermath, of, a, computer, security, incident, or, compromise, with, the, goal, of, preventing, a, breach, or, thwarting, a, cyberattack, an, incident, that, is, not, identified, and, managed, at, the, time, of, intrusion, typically, escalates, to, a, more, damaging, event, such, as, a, data, breach, or, system, failure, the, intended, outcome, of, a, computer, security, incident, response, plan, is, to, contain, the, incident, limit, damage, and, assist, recovery, to, business, as, usual, responding, to, compromises, quickly, can, mitigate, exploited, vulnerabilities, restore, services, and, processes, and, minimize, losses, incident, response, planning, allows, an, organization, to, establish, a, series, of, best, practices, to, stop, an, intrusion, before, it, causes, damage, typical, incident, response, plans, contain, a, set, of, written, instructions, that, outline, the, organization, s, response, to, a, cyberattack, without, a, documented, plan, in, place, an, organization, may, not, successfully, detect, an, intrusion, or, compromise, and, stakeholders, may, not, understand, their, roles, processes, and, procedures, during, an, escalation, slowing, the, organization, s, response, and, resolution, there, are, four, key, components, of, a, computer, security, incident, response, plan, some, illustrative, examples, of, different, types, of, computer, security, breaches, are, given, below, in, 1988, 60, 000, computers, were, connected, to, the, internet, and, most, were, mainframes, minicomputers, and, professional, workstations, on, 2, november, 1988, many, started, to, slow, down, because, they, were, running, a, malicious, code, that, demanded, processor, time, and, that, spread, itself, to, other, computers, the, first, internet, computer, worm, the, software, was, traced, back, to, 23, year, old, cornell, university, graduate, student, robert, tappan, morris, who, said, he, wanted, to, count, how, many, machines, were, connected, to, the, internet, in, 1994, over, a, hundred, intrusions, were, made, by, unidentified, crackers, into, the, rome, laboratory, the, us, air, force, s, main, command, and, research, facility, using, trojan, horses, hackers, were, able, to, obtain, unrestricted, access, to, rome, s, networking, systems, and, remove, traces, of, their, activities, the, intruders, were, able, to, obtain, classified, files, such, as, air, tasking, order, systems, data, and, furthermore, able, to, penetrate, connected, networks, of, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, s, goddard, space, flight, center, wright, patterson, air, force, base, some, defense, contractors, and, other, private, sector, organizations, by, posing, as, a, trusted, rome, center, user, in, early, 2007, american, apparel, and, home, goods, company, tjx, announced, that, it, was, the, victim, of, an, unauthorized, computer, systems, intrusion, and, that, the, hackers, had, accessed, a, system, that, stored, data, on, credit, card, debit, card, check, and, merchandise, return, transactions, in, 2010, the, computer, worm, known, as, stuxnet, reportedly, ruined, almost, one, fifth, of, iran, s, nuclear, centrifuges, it, did, so, by, disrupting, industrial, programmable, logic, controllers, plcs, in, a, targeted, attack, this, is, generally, believed, to, have, been, launched, by, israel, and, the, united, states, to, disrupt, iran, s, nuclear, program, although, neither, has, publicly, admitted, this, in, early, 2013, documents, provided, by, edward, snowden, were, published, by, the, washington, post, and, the, guardian, exposing, the, massive, scale, of, nsa, global, surveillance, there, were, also, indications, that, the, nsa, may, have, inserted, a, backdoor, in, a, nist, standard, for, encryption, this, standard, was, later, withdrawn, due, to, widespread, criticism, the, nsa, additionally, were, revealed, to, have, tapped, the, links, between, google, s, data, centers, a, ukrainian, hacker, known, as, rescator, broke, into, target, corporation, computers, in, 2013, stealing, roughly, 40, million, credit, cards, and, then, home, depot, computers, in, 2014, stealing, between, 53, and, 56, million, credit, card, numbers, warnings, were, delivered, at, both, corporations, but, ignored, physical, security, breaches, using, self, checkout, machines, are, believed, to, have, played, a, large, role, the, malware, utilized, is, absolutely, unsophisticated, and, uninteresting, says, jim, walter, director, of, threat, intelligence, operations, at, security, technology, company, mcafee, meaning, that, the, heists, could, have, easily, been, stopped, by, existing, antivirus, software, had, administrators, responded, to, the, warnings, the, size, of, the, thefts, has, resulted, in, major, attention, from, state, and, federal, united, states, authorities, and, the, investigation, is, ongoing, in, april, 2015, the, office, of, personnel, management, discovered, it, had, been, hacked, more, than, a, year, earlier, in, a, data, breach, resulting, in, the, theft, of, approximately, 21, 5, million, personnel, records, handled, by, the, office, the, office, of, personnel, management, hack, has, been, described, by, federal, officials, as, among, the, largest, breaches, of, government, data, in, the, history, of, the, united, states, data, targeted, in, the, breach, included, personally, identifiable, information, such, as, social, security, numbers, names, dates, and, places, of, birth, addresses, and, fingerprints, of, current, and, former, government, employees, as, well, as, anyone, who, had, undergone, a, government, background, check, it, is, believed, the, hack, was, perpetrated, by, chinese, hackers, in, july, 2015, a, hacker, group, is, known, as, the, impact, team, successfully, breached, the, extramarital, relationship, website, ashley, madison, created, by, avid, life, media, the, group, claimed, that, they, had, taken, not, only, company, data, but, user, data, as, well, after, the, breach, the, impact, team, dumped, emails, from, the, company, s, ceo, to, prove, their, point, and, threatened, to, dump, customer, data, unless, the, website, was, taken, down, permanently, when, avid, life, media, did, not, take, the, site, offline, the, group, released, two, more, compressed, files, one, 9, 7gb, and, the, second, 20gb, after, the, second, data, dump, avid, life, media, ceo, noel, biderman, resigned, but, the, website, remained, to, function, in, june, 2021, the, cyber, attack, took, down, the, largest, fuel, pipeline, in, the, u, s, and, led, to, shortages, across, the, east, coast, international, legal, issues, of, cyber, attacks, are, complicated, in, nature, there, is, no, global, base, of, common, rules, to, judge, and, eventually, punish, cybercrimes, and, cybercriminals, and, where, security, firms, or, agencies, do, locate, the, cybercriminal, behind, the, creation, of, a, particular, piece, of, malware, or, form, of, cyber, attack, often, the, local, authorities, cannot, take, action, due, to, lack, of, laws, under, which, to, prosecute, proving, attribution, for, cybercrimes, and, cyberattacks, is, also, a, major, problem, for, all, law, enforcement, agencies, computer, viruses, switch, from, one, country, to, another, from, one, jurisdiction, to, another, moving, around, the, world, using, the, fact, that, we, don, t, have, the, capability, to, globally, police, operations, like, this, so, the, internet, is, as, if, someone, given, free, plane, tickets, to, all, the, online, criminals, of, the, world, the, use, of, techniques, such, as, dynamic, dns, fast, flux, and, bullet, proof, servers, add, to, the, difficulty, of, investigation, and, enforcement, the, role, of, the, government, is, to, make, regulations, to, force, companies, and, organizations, to, protect, their, systems, infrastructure, and, information, from, any, cyberattacks, but, also, to, protect, its, own, national, infrastructure, such, as, the, national, power, grid, the, government, s, regulatory, role, in, cyberspace, is, complicated, for, some, cyberspace, was, seen, as, a, virtual, space, that, was, to, remain, free, of, government, intervention, as, can, be, seen, in, many, of, today, s, libertarian, blockchain, and, bitcoin, discussions, many, government, officials, and, experts, think, that, the, government, should, do, more, and, that, there, is, a, crucial, need, for, improved, regulation, mainly, due, to, the, failure, of, the, private, sector, to, solve, efficiently, the, cybersecurity, problem, r, clarke, said, during, a, panel, discussion, at, the, rsa, security, conference, in, san, francisco, he, believes, that, the, industry, only, responds, when, you, threaten, regulation, if, the, industry, doesn, t, respond, to, the, threat, you, have, to, follow, through, on, the, other, hand, executives, from, the, private, sector, agree, that, improvements, are, necessary, but, think, that, government, intervention, would, affect, their, ability, to, innovate, efficiently, daniel, r, mccarthy, analyzed, this, public, private, partnership, in, cybersecurity, and, reflected, on, the, role, of, cybersecurity, in, the, broader, constitution, of, political, order, on, 22, may, 2020, the, un, security, council, held, its, second, ever, informal, meeting, on, cybersecurity, to, focus, on, cyber, challenges, to, international, peace, according, to, un, secretary, general, ant, nio, guterres, new, technologies, are, too, often, used, to, violate, rights, many, different, teams, and, organizations, exist, including, on, 14, april, 2016, the, european, parliament, and, the, council, of, the, european, union, adopted, the, general, data, protection, regulation, gdpr, the, gdpr, which, came, into, force, on, 25, may, 2018, grants, individuals, within, the, european, union, eu, and, the, european, economic, area, eea, the, right, to, the, protection, of, personal, data, the, regulation, requires, that, any, entity, that, processes, personal, data, incorporate, data, protection, by, design, and, by, default, it, also, requires, that, certain, organizations, appoint, a, data, protection, officer, dpo, most, countries, have, their, own, computer, emergency, response, team, to, protect, network, security, since, 2010, canada, has, had, a, cybersecurity, strategy, this, functions, as, a, counterpart, document, to, the, national, strategy, and, action, plan, for, critical, infrastructure, the, strategy, has, three, main, pillars, securing, government, systems, securing, vital, private, cyber, systems, and, helping, canadians, to, be, secure, online, there, is, also, a, cyber, incident, management, framework, to, provide, a, coordinated, response, in, the, event, of, a, cyber, incident, the, canadian, cyber, incident, response, centre, ccirc, is, responsible, for, mitigating, and, responding, to, threats, to, canada, s, critical, infrastructure, and, cyber, systems, it, provides, support, to, mitigate, cyber, threats, technical, support, to, respond, recover, from, targeted, cyber, attacks, and, provides, online, tools, for, members, of, canada, s, critical, infrastructure, sectors, it, posts, regular, cybersecurity, bulletins, operates, an, online, reporting, tool, where, individuals, and, organizations, can, report, a, cyber, incident, to, inform, the, general, public, on, how, to, protect, themselves, online, public, safety, canada, has, partnered, with, stop, think, connect, a, coalition, of, non, profit, private, sector, and, government, organizations, and, launched, the, cyber, security, cooperation, program, they, also, run, the, getcybersafe, portal, for, canadian, citizens, and, cyber, security, awareness, month, during, october, public, safety, canada, aims, to, begin, an, evaluation, of, canada, s, cybersecurity, strategy, in, early, 2015, australian, federal, government, announced, an, 18, 2, million, investment, to, fortify, the, cybersecurity, resilience, of, small, and, medium, enterprises, smes, and, enhance, their, capabilities, in, responding, to, cyber, threats, this, financial, backing, is, an, integral, component, of, the, soon, to, be, unveiled, 2023, 2030, australian, cyber, security, strategy, slated, for, release, within, the, current, week, a, substantial, allocation, of, 7, 2, million, is, earmarked, for, the, establishment, of, a, voluntary, cyber, health, check, program, facilitating, businesses, in, conducting, a, comprehensive, and, tailored, self, assessment, of, their, cybersecurity, upskill, this, avant, garde, health, assessment, serves, as, a, diagnostic, tool, enabling, enterprises, to, ascertain, the, robustness, of, australia, s, cyber, security, regulations, furthermore, it, affords, them, access, to, a, repository, of, educational, resources, and, materials, fostering, the, acquisition, of, skills, necessary, for, an, elevated, cybersecurity, posture, this, groundbreaking, initiative, was, jointly, disclosed, by, minister, for, cyber, security, clare, o, neil, and, minister, for, small, business, julie, collins, some, provisions, for, cybersecurity, have, been, incorporated, into, rules, framed, under, the, information, technology, act, 2000, the, national, cyber, security, policy, 2013, is, a, policy, framework, by, the, ministry, of, electronics, and, information, technology, meity, which, aims, to, protect, the, public, and, private, infrastructure, from, cyberattacks, and, safeguard, information, such, as, personal, information, of, web, users, financial, and, banking, information, and, sovereign, data, cert, in, is, the, nodal, agency, which, monitors, the, cyber, threats, in, the, country, the, post, of, national, cyber, security, coordinator, has, also, been, created, in, the, prime, minister, s, office, pmo, the, indian, companies, act, 2013, has, also, introduced, cyber, law, and, cybersecurity, obligations, on, the, part, of, indian, directors, some, provisions, for, cybersecurity, have, been, incorporated, into, rules, framed, under, the, information, technology, act, 2000, update, in, 2013, following, cyberattacks, in, the, first, half, of, 2013, when, the, government, news, media, television, stations, and, bank, websites, were, compromised, the, national, government, committed, to, the, training, of, 5, 000, new, cybersecurity, experts, by, 2017, the, south, korean, government, blamed, its, northern, counterpart, for, these, attacks, as, well, as, incidents, that, occurred, in, 2009, 2011, and, 2012, but, pyongyang, denies, the, accusations, the, united, states, has, its, first, fully, formed, cyber, plan, in, 15, years, as, a, result, of, the, release, of, this, national, cyber, plan, in, this, policy, the, us, says, it, will, protect, the, country, by, keeping, networks, systems, functions, and, data, safe, promote, american, wealth, by, building, a, strong, digital, economy, and, encouraging, strong, domestic, innovation, peace, and, safety, should, be, kept, by, making, it, easier, for, the, us, to, stop, people, from, using, computer, tools, for, bad, things, working, with, friends, and, partners, to, do, this, and, increase, the, united, states, impact, around, the, world, to, support, the, main, ideas, behind, an, open, safe, reliable, and, compatible, internet, the, new, u, s, cyber, strategy, seeks, to, allay, some, of, those, concerns, by, promoting, responsible, behavior, in, cyberspace, urging, nations, to, adhere, to, a, set, of, norms, both, through, international, law, and, voluntary, standards, it, also, calls, for, specific, measures, to, harden, u, s, government, networks, from, attacks, like, the, june, 2015, intrusion, into, the, u, s, office, of, personnel, management, opm, which, compromised, the, records, of, about, 4, 2, million, current, and, former, government, employees, and, the, strategy, calls, for, the, u, s, to, continue, to, name, and, shame, bad, cyber, actors, calling, them, out, publicly, for, attacks, when, possible, along, with, the, use, of, economic, sanctions, and, diplomatic, pressure, the, 1986, 18, u, s, c, 1030, the, computer, fraud, and, abuse, act, is, the, key, legislation, it, prohibits, unauthorized, access, or, damage, of, protected, computers, as, defined, in,

requirements, under, 10, cfr, part, 73, specifically, in, 73, 54, the, nuclear, energy, institute, s, nei, 08, 09, document, cyber, security, plan, for, nuclear, power, reactors, outlines, a, comprehensive, framework, for, cybersecurity, in, the, nuclear, power, industry, drafted, with, input, from, the, u, s, nrc, this, guideline, is, instrumental, in, aiding, licensees, to, comply, with, the, code, of, federal, regulations, cfr, which, mandates, robust, protection, of, digital, computers, and, equipment, and, communications, systems, at, nuclear, power, plants, against, cyber, threats, there, is, growing, concern, that, cyberspace, will, become, the, next, theater, of, warfare, as, mark, clayton, from, the, christian, science, monitor, wrote, in, a, 2015, article, titled, the, new, cyber, arms, race, in, the, future, wars, will, not, just, be, fought, by, soldiers, with, guns, or, with, planes, that, drop, bombs, they, will, also, be, fought, with, the, click, of, a, mouse, a, half, a, world, away, that, unleashes, carefully, weaponized, computer, programs, that, disrupt, or, destroy, critical, industries, like, utilities, transportation, communications, and, energy, such, attacks, could, also, disable, military, networks, that, control, the, movement, of, troops, the, path, of, jet, fighters, the, command, and, control, of, warships, this, has, led, to, new, terms, such, as, cyberwarfare, and, cyberterrorism, the, united, states, cyber, command, was, created, in, 2009, and, many, other, countries, have, similar, forces, there, are, a, few, critical, voices, that, question, whether, cybersecurity, is, as, significant, a, threat, as, it, is, made, out, to, be, cybersecurity, is, a, fast, growing, field, of, it, concerned, with, reducing, organizations, risk, of, hack, or, data, breaches, according, to, research, from, the, enterprise, strategy, group, 46, of, organizations, say, that, they, have, a, problematic, shortage, of, cybersecurity, skills, in, 2016, up, from, 28, in, 2015, commercial, government, and, non, governmental, organizations, all, employ, cybersecurity, professionals, the, fastest, increases, in, demand, for, cybersecurity, workers, are, in, industries, managing, increasing, volumes, of, consumer, data, such, as, finance, health, care, and, retail, however, the, use, of, the, term, cybersecurity, is, more, prevalent, in, government, job, descriptions, typical, cybersecurity, job, titles, and, descriptions, include, student, programs, are, also, available, for, people, interested, in, beginning, a, career, in, cybersecurity, meanwhile, a, flexible, and, effective, option, for, information, security, professionals, of, all, experience, levels, to, keep, studying, is, online, security, training, including, webcasts, a, wide, range, of, certified, courses, are, also, available, in, the, united, kingdom, a, nationwide, set, of, cybersecurity, forums, known, as, the, u, k, cyber, security, forum, were, established, supported, by, the, government, s, cybersecurity, strategy, in, order, to, encourage, start, ups, and, innovation, and, to, address, the, skills, gap, identified, by, the, u, k, government, in, singapore, the, cyber, security, agency, has, issued, a, singapore, operational, technology, ot, cybersecurity, competency, framework, otccf, the, framework, defines, emerging, cybersecurity, roles, in, operational, technology, the, otccf, was, endorsed, by, the, infocomm, media, development, authority, imda, it, outlines, the, different, ot, cybersecurity, job, positions, as, well, as, the, technical, skills, and, core, competencies, necessary, it, also, depicts, the, many, career, paths, available, including, vertical, and, lateral, advancement, opportunities, the, following, terms, used, with, regards, to, computer, security, are, explained, below, since, the, internet, s, arrival, and, with, the, digital, transformation, initiated, in, recent, years, the, notion, of, cybersecurity, has, become, a, familiar, subject, in, both, our, professional, and, personal, lives, cybersecurity, and, cyber, threats, have, been, consistently, present, for, the, last, 60, years, of, technological, change, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, computer, security, was, mainly, limited, to, academia, until, the, conception, of, the, internet, where, with, increased, connectivity, computer, viruses, and, network, intrusions, began, to, take, off, after, the, spread, of, viruses, in, the, 1990s, the, 2000s, marked, the, institutionalization, of, organized, attacks, such, as, distributed, denial, of, service, this, led, to, the, formalization, of, cybersecurity, as, a, professional, discipline, the, april, 1967, session, organized, by, willis, ware, at, the, spring, joint, computer, conference, and, the, later, publication, of, the, ware, report, were, foundational, moments, in, the, history, of, the, field, of, computer, security, ware, s, work, straddled, the, intersection, of, material, cultural, political, and, social, concerns, a, 1977, nist, publication, introduced, the, cia, triad, of, confidentiality, integrity, and, availability, as, a, clear, and, simple, way, to, describe, key, security, goals, while, still, relevant, many, more, elaborate, frameworks, have, since, been, proposed, however, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, there, were, no, grave, computer, threats, because, computers, and, the, internet, were, still, developing, and, security, threats, were, easily, identifiable, more, often, threats, came, from, malicious, insiders, who, gained, unauthorized, access, to, sensitive, documents, and, files, although, malware, and, network, breaches, existed, during, the, early, years, they, did, not, use, them, for, financial, gain, by, the, second, half, of, the, 1970s, established, computer, firms, like, ibm, started, offering, commercial, access, control, systems, and, computer, security, software, products, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, an, attack, on, a, computer, network, was, the, computer, worm, creeper, written, by, bob, thomas, at, bbn, which, propagated, through, the, arpanet, in, 1971, the, program, was, purely, experimental, in, nature, and, carried, no, malicious, payload, a, later, program, reaper, was, created, by, ray, tomlinson, in, 1972, and, used, to, destroy, creeper, between, september, 1986, and, june, 1987, a, group, of, german, hackers, performed, the, first, documented, case, of, cyber, espionage, the, group, hacked, into, american, defense, contractors, universities, and, military, base, networks, and, sold, gathered, information, to, the, soviet, kgb, the, group, was, led, by, markus, hess, who, was, arrested, on, 29, june, 1987, he, was, convicted, of, espionage, along, with, two, co, conspirators, on, 15, feb, 1990, in, 1988, one, of, the, first, computer, worms, called, the, morris, worm, was, distributed, via, the, internet, it, gained, significant, mainstream, media, attention, in, 1993, netscape, started, developing, the, protocol, ssl, shortly, after, the, national, center, for, supercomputing, applications, ncsa, launched, mosaic, 1, 0, the, first, web, browser, in, 1993, netscape, had, ssl, version, 1, 0, ready, in, 1994, but, it, was, never, released, to, the, public, due, to, many, serious, security, vulnerabilities, these, weaknesses, included, replay, attacks, and, a, vulnerability, that, allowed, hackers, to, alter, unencrypted, communications, sent, by, users, however, in, february, 1995, netscape, launched, version, 2, 0, the, national, security, agency, nsa, is, responsible, for, the, protection, of, u, s, information, systems, and, also, for, collecting, foreign, intelligence, the, agency, analyzes, commonly, used, software, and, system, configurations, to, find, security, flaws, which, it, can, use, for, offensive, purposes, against, competitors, of, the, united, states, nsa, contractors, created, and, sold, click, and, shoot, attack, tools, to, us, agencies, and, close, allies, but, eventually, the, tools, made, their, way, to, foreign, adversaries, in, 2016, nsas, own, hacking, tools, were, hacked, and, they, have, been, used, by, russia, and, north, korea, nsa, s, employees, and, contractors, have, been, recruited, at, high, salaries, by, adversaries, anxious, to, compete, in, cyberwarfare, in, 2007, the, united, states, and, israel, began, exploiting, security, flaws, in, the, microsoft, windows, operating, system, to, attack, and, damage, equipment, used, in, iran, to, refine, nuclear, materials, iran, responded, by, heavily, investing, in, their, own, cyberwarfare, capability, which, it, began, using, against, the, united, states
