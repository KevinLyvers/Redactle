an, atomic, clock, is, a, clock, that, measures, time, by, monitoring, the, resonant, frequency, of, atoms, it, is, based, on, atoms, having, different, energy, levels, electron, states, in, an, atom, are, associated, with, different, energy, levels, and, in, transitions, between, such, states, they, interact, with, a, very, specific, frequency, of, electromagnetic, radiation, this, phenomenon, serves, as, the, basis, for, the, international, system, of, units, si, definition, of, a, second, the, second, symbol, s, is, the, si, unit, of, time, it, is, defined, by, taking, the, fixed, numerical, value, of, the, caesium, frequency, cs, displaystyle, delta, nu, text, cs, the, unperturbed, ground, state, hyperfine, transition, frequency, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, to, be, 9, 192, 631, 770, when, expressed, in, the, unit, hz, which, is, equal, to, s, 1, this, definition, is, the, basis, for, the, system, of, international, atomic, time, tai, which, is, maintained, by, an, ensemble, of, atomic, clocks, around, the, world, the, system, of, coordinated, universal, time, utc, that, is, the, basis, of, civil, time, implements, leap, seconds, to, allow, clock, time, to, track, changes, in, earth, s, rotation, to, within, one, second, while, being, based, on, clocks, that, are, based, on, the, definition, of, the, second, though, leap, seconds, will, be, phased, out, in, 2035, the, accurate, timekeeping, capabilities, of, atomic, clocks, are, also, used, for, navigation, by, satellite, networks, such, as, the, european, union, s, galileo, programme, and, the, united, states, gps, the, timekeeping, accuracy, of, the, involved, atomic, clocks, is, important, because, the, smaller, the, error, in, time, measurement, the, smaller, the, error, in, distance, obtained, by, multiplying, the, time, by, the, speed, of, light, is, a, timing, error, of, a, nanosecond, or, 1, billionth, of, a, second, 10, 9, or, 1, 1, 000, 000, 000, second, translates, into, an, almost, 30, centimetre, 11, 8, in, distance, and, hence, positional, error, the, main, variety, of, atomic, clock, uses, caesium, atoms, cooled, to, temperatures, that, approach, absolute, zero, the, primary, standard, for, the, united, states, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, s, caesium, fountain, clock, named, nist, f2, measures, time, with, an, uncertainty, of, 1, second, in, 300, million, years, relative, uncertainty, 10, 16, nist, f2, was, brought, online, on, 3, april, 2014, the, scottish, physicist, james, clerk, maxwell, proposed, measuring, time, with, the, vibrations, of, light, waves, in, his, 1873, treatise, on, electricity, and, magnetism, a, more, universal, unit, of, time, might, be, found, by, taking, the, periodic, time, of, vibration, of, the, particular, kind, of, light, whose, wave, length, is, the, unit, of, length, maxwell, argued, this, would, be, more, accurate, than, the, earth, s, rotation, which, defines, the, mean, solar, second, for, timekeeping, during, the, 1930s, the, american, physicist, isidor, isaac, rabi, built, equipment, for, atomic, beam, magnetic, resonance, frequency, clocks, the, accuracy, of, mechanical, electromechanical, and, quartz, clocks, is, reduced, by, temperature, fluctuations, this, led, to, the, idea, of, measuring, the, frequency, of, an, atom, s, vibrations, to, keep, time, much, more, accurately, as, proposed, by, james, clerk, maxwell, lord, kelvin, and, isidor, rabi, he, proposed, the, concept, in, 1945, which, led, to, a, demonstration, of, a, clock, based, on, ammonia, in, 1949, this, led, to, the, first, practical, accurate, atomic, clock, with, caesium, atoms, being, built, at, the, national, physical, laboratory, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1955, by, louis, essen, in, collaboration, with, jack, parry, in, 1949, alfred, kastler, and, jean, brossel, developed, a, technique, called, optical, pumping, for, electron, energy, level, transitions, in, atoms, using, light, this, technique, is, useful, for, creating, much, stronger, magnetic, resonance, and, microwave, absorption, signals, unfortunately, this, caused, a, side, effect, with, a, light, shift, of, the, resonant, frequency, claude, cohen, tannoudji, and, others, managed, to, reduce, the, light, shifts, to, acceptable, levels, ramsey, developed, a, method, commonly, known, as, ramsey, interferometry, nowadays, for, higher, frequencies, and, narrower, resonances, in, the, oscillating, fields, kolsky, phipps, ramsey, and, silsbee, used, this, technique, for, molecular, beam, spectroscopy, in, 1950, after, 1956, atomic, clocks, were, studied, by, many, groups, such, as, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, formerly, the, national, bureau, of, standards, in, the, usa, the, physikalisch, technische, bundesanstalt, ptb, in, germany, the, national, research, council, nrc, in, canada, the, national, physical, laboratory, in, the, united, kingdom, international, time, bureau, french, bureau, international, de, l, heure, abbreviated, bih, at, the, paris, observatory, the, national, radio, company, bomac, varian, hewlett, packard, and, frequency, time, systems, during, the, 1950s, the, national, radio, company, sold, more, than, 50, units, of, the, first, atomic, clock, the, atomichron, in, 1964, engineers, at, hewlett, packard, released, the, 5060, rack, mounted, model, of, caesium, clocks, in, 1968, the, duration, of, the, second, was, defined, to, be, 9, 192, 631, 770, vibrations, of, the, unperturbed, ground, state, hyperfine, transition, frequency, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, prior, to, that, it, was, defined, by, there, being, 31, 556, 925, 9747, seconds, in, the, tropical, year, 1900, the, 1968, definition, was, updated, in, 2019, to, reflect, the, new, definitions, of, the, ampere, kelvin, kilogram, and, mole, decided, upon, at, the, 2019, revision, of, the, international, system, of, units, timekeeping, researchers, are, currently, working, on, developing, an, even, more, stable, atomic, reference, for, the, second, with, a, plan, to, find, a, more, precise, definition, of, the, second, as, atomic, clocks, improve, based, on, optical, clocks, or, the, rydberg, constant, around, 2030, technological, developments, such, as, lasers, and, optical, frequency, combs, in, the, 1990s, led, to, increasing, accuracy, of, atomic, clocks, lasers, enable, the, possibility, of, optical, range, control, over, atomic, states, transitions, which, has, a, much, higher, frequency, than, that, of, microwaves, while, optical, frequency, comb, measures, highly, accurately, such, high, frequency, oscillation, in, light, the, first, advance, beyond, the, precision, of, caesium, clocks, occurred, at, nist, in, 2010, with, the, demonstration, of, a, quantum, logic, optical, clock, that, used, aluminum, ions, to, achieve, a, precision, of, 10, 17, optical, clocks, are, a, very, active, area, of, research, in, the, field, of, metrology, as, scientists, work, to, develop, clocks, based, on, elements, ytterbium, mercury, aluminum, and, strontium, scientists, at, jila, demonstrated, a, strontium, clock, with, a, frequency, precision, of, 10, 18, in, 2015, scientists, at, nist, developed, a, quantum, logic, clock, that, measured, a, single, aluminum, ion, in, 2019, with, a, frequency, uncertainty, of, 10, 19, at, jila, in, september, 2021, scientists, demonstrated, an, optical, strontium, clock, with, a, frequency, differential, precision, of, 7, 6, 10, 21, the, second, is, expected, to, be, redefined, when, the, field, of, optical, clocks, matures, sometime, around, the, year, 2026, or, 2030, in, order, for, this, to, occur, optical, clocks, must, be, capable, of, measuring, time, to, very, high, precision, consistently, in, addition, methods, for, reliably, and, accurately, comparing, different, optical, clocks, around, the, world, in, national, metrology, labs, must, be, demonstrated, in, addition, to, increased, accuracy, the, development, of, chip, scale, atomic, clocks, has, expanded, the, number, of, places, atomic, clocks, can, be, used, in, august, 2004, nist, scientists, demonstrated, a, chip, scale, atomic, clock, that, was, 100, times, smaller, than, an, ordinary, atomic, clock, and, had, a, much, smaller, power, consumption, of, 125, mw, the, atomic, clock, was, about, the, size, of, a, grain, of, rice, with, a, frequency, of, about, 9, ghz, this, technology, became, available, commercially, in, 2011, atomic, clocks, on, the, scale, of, one, chip, require, less, than, 30, milliwatts, of, power, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, created, a, program, nist, on, a, chip, to, develop, compact, ways, of, measuring, time, with, a, device, just, a, few, millimeters, across, metrologists, are, currently, 2022, designing, atomic, clocks, that, implement, new, developments, such, as, ion, traps, and, optical, combs, to, reach, greater, accuracies, an, atomic, clock, is, based, on, a, system, of, atoms, which, may, be, in, one, of, two, possible, energy, states, a, group, of, atoms, in, one, state, is, prepared, then, subjected, to, microwave, radiation, if, the, radiation, is, of, the, correct, frequency, a, number, of, atoms, will, transition, to, the, other, energy, state, the, closer, the, frequency, is, to, the, inherent, oscillation, frequency, of, the, atoms, the, more, atoms, will, switch, states, such, correlation, allows, very, accurate, tuning, of, the, frequency, of, the, microwave, radiation, once, the, microwave, radiation, is, adjusted, to, a, known, frequency, where, the, maximum, number, of, atoms, switch, states, the, atom, and, thus, its, associated, transition, frequency, can, be, used, as, a, timekeeping, oscillator, to, measure, elapsed, time, a, number, of, national, metrology, laboratories, maintain, atomic, clocks, including, paris, observatory, the, physikalisch, technische, bundesanstalt, ptb, in, germany, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, in, colorado, and, maryland, usa, jila, in, the, university, of, colorado, boulder, the, national, physical, laboratory, npl, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, all, russian, scientific, research, institute, for, physical, engineering, and, radiotechnical, metrology, they, do, this, by, designing, and, building, frequency, standards, that, produce, electric, oscillations, at, a, frequency, whose, relationship, to, the, transition, frequency, of, caesium, 133, is, known, in, order, to, achieve, a, very, low, uncertainty, these, primary, frequency, standards, estimate, and, correct, various, frequency, shifts, including, relativistic, doppler, shifts, linked, to, atomic, motion, the, thermal, radiation, of, the, environment, blackbody, shift, and, several, other, factors, the, best, primary, standards, currently, produce, the, si, second, with, an, accuracy, approaching, an, uncertainty, of, one, part, in, 10, 16, it, is, important, to, note, that, at, this, level, of, accuracy, the, differences, in, the, gravitational, field, in, the, device, cannot, be, ignored, the, standard, is, then, considered, in, the, framework, of, general, relativity, to, provide, a, proper, time, at, a, specific, point, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, provides, a, list, of, frequencies, that, serve, as, secondary, representations, of, the, second, this, list, contains, the, frequency, values, and, respective, standard, uncertainties, for, the, rubidium, microwave, transition, and, other, optical, transitions, including, neutral, atoms, and, single, trapped, ions, these, secondary, frequency, standards, can, be, as, accurate, as, one, part, in, 10, 18, however, the, uncertainties, in, the, list, are, one, part, in, 10, 14, 10, 16, this, is, because, the, uncertainty, in, the, central, caesium, standard, against, which, the, secondary, standards, are, calibrated, is, one, part, in, 10, 14, 10, 16, primary, frequency, standards, can, be, used, to, calibrate, the, frequency, of, other, clocks, used, in, national, laboratories, these, are, usually, commercial, caesium, clocks, having, very, good, long, term, frequency, stability, maintaining, a, frequency, with, a, stability, better, than, 1, part, in, 10, 14, over, a, few, months, the, uncertainty, of, the, primary, standard, frequencies, is, around, one, part, in, 10, 13, hydrogen, masers, which, rely, on, the, 1, 4, ghz, hyperfine, transition, in, atomic, hydrogen, are, also, used, in, time, metrology, laboratories, masers, outperform, any, commercial, caesium, clock, in, terms, of, short, term, frequency, stability, in, the, past, these, instruments, have, been, used, in, all, applications, that, require, a, steady, reference, across, time, periods, of, less, than, one, day, frequency, stability, of, about, 1, part, in, ten, for, averaging, times, of, a, few, hours, because, some, active, hydrogen, masers, have, a, modest, but, predictable, frequency, drift, with, time, they, have, become, an, important, part, of, the, bipm, s, ensemble, of, commercial, clocks, that, implement, international, atomic, time, the, time, readings, of, clocks, operated, in, metrology, labs, operating, with, the, bipm, need, to, be, known, very, accurately, some, operations, require, synchronization, of, atomic, clocks, separated, by, great, distances, over, thousands, of, kilometers, global, navigational, satellite, systems, gnss, provide, a, satisfactory, solution, to, the, problem, of, time, transfer, atomic, clocks, are, used, to, broadcast, time, signals, in, the, united, states, global, positioning, system, gps, the, russian, federation, s, global, navigation, satellite, system, glonass, the, european, union, s, galileo, system, and, china, s, beidou, system, the, signal, received, from, one, satellite, in, a, metrology, laboratory, equipped, with, a, receiver, with, an, accurately, known, position, allows, the, time, difference, between, the, local, time, scale, and, the, gnss, system, time, to, be, determined, with, an, uncertainty, of, a, few, nanoseconds, when, averaged, over, 15, minutes, receivers, allow, the, simultaneous, reception, of, signals, from, several, satellites, and, make, use, of, signals, transmitted, on, two, frequencies, as, more, satellites, are, launched, and, start, operations, time, measurements, will, become, more, accurate, these, methods, of, time, comparison, must, make, corrections, for, the, effects, of, special, relativity, and, general, relativity, of, a, few, nanoseconds, national, laboratories, usually, operate, a, range, of, clocks, these, are, operated, independently, of, one, another, and, their, measurements, are, sometimes, combined, to, generate, a, scale, that, is, more, stable, and, more, accurate, than, that, of, any, individual, contributing, clocks, this, scale, allows, for, time, comparisons, between, different, clocks, in, the, laboratory, these, atomic, time, scales, are, generally, referred, to, as, ta, k, for, laboratory, k, coordinated, universal, time, utc, is, the, result, of, comparing, clocks, in, national, laboratories, around, the, world, to, international, atomic, time, tai, then, adding, leap, seconds, as, necessary, tai, is, a, weighted, average, of, around, 450, clocks, in, some, 80, time, institutions, the, relative, stability, of, tai, is, around, one, part, in, 10, 16, before, tai, is, published, the, frequency, of, the, result, is, compared, with, the, si, second, at, various, primary, and, secondary, frequency, standards, this, requires, relativistic, corrections, to, be, applied, to, the, location, of, the, primary, standard, which, depend, on, the, distance, between, the, equal, gravity, potential, and, the, rotating, geoid, of, earth, the, values, of, the, rotating, geoid, and, the, tai, change, slightly, each, month, and, are, available, in, the, bipm, circular, t, publication, the, tai, time, scale, is, deferred, by, a, few, weeks, as, the, average, of, atomic, clocks, around, the, world, is, calculated, tai, is, not, distributed, in, everyday, timekeeping, instead, an, integer, number, of, leap, seconds, are, added, or, subtracted, to, correct, for, the, earth, s, rotation, producing, utc, the, number, of, leap, seconds, is, changed, so, that, mean, solar, noon, at, the, greenwich, meridian, does, not, deviate, from, utc, noon, by, more, than, 0, 9, seconds, national, metrology, institutions, maintain, an, approximation, of, utc, referred, to, as, utc, k, for, laboratory, k, utc, k, is, distributed, by, the, bipm, s, consultative, committee, for, time, and, frequency, the, offset, utc, utc, k, is, calculated, every, 5, days, the, results, are, published, monthly, atomic, clocks, record, utc, k, to, no, more, than, 100, nanoseconds, in, some, countries, utc, k, is, the, legal, time, that, is, distributed, by, radio, television, telephone, internet, fiber, optic, cables, time, signal, transmitters, and, speaking, clocks, in, addition, gnss, provides, time, information, accurate, to, a, few, tens, of, nanoseconds, or, better, the, si, second, is, defined, as, a, certain, number, of, unperturbed, ground, state, hyperfine, transitions, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, caesium, standards, are, therefore, regarded, as, primary, time, and, frequency, standards, caesium, clocks, include, the, nist, f1, clock, developed, in, 1999, and, the, nist, f2, clock, developed, in, 2013, caesium, has, several, properties, that, make, it, a, good, choice, for, an, atomic, clock, whereas, a, hydrogen, atom, moves, at, 1, 600, m, s, at, room, temperature, and, a, nitrogen, atom, moves, at, 510, m, s, a, caesium, atom, moves, at, a, much, slower, speed, of, 130, m, s, due, to, its, greater, mass, the, hyperfine, frequency, of, caesium, 9, 19, ghz, is, also, higher, than, other, elements, such, as, rubidium, 6, 8, ghz, and, hydrogen, 1, 4, ghz, the, high, frequency, of, caesium, allows, for, more, accurate, measurements, caesium, reference, tubes, suitable, for, national, standards, currently, last, about, seven, years, and, cost, about, us, 35, 000, primary, frequency, and, time, standards, like, the, united, states, time, standard, atomic, clocks, nist, f1, and, nist, f2, use, far, higher, power, in, a, caesium, beam, frequency, reference, timing, signals, are, derived, from, a, high, stability, voltage, controlled, quartz, crystal, oscillator, vcxo, that, is, tunable, over, a, narrow, range, the, output, frequency, of, the, vcxo, typically, 5, mhz, is, multiplied, by, a, frequency, synthesizer, to, obtain, microwaves, at, the, frequency, of, the, caesium, atomic, hyperfine, transition, about, 9, 192, 6317, mhz, the, output, of, the, frequency, synthesizer, is, amplified, and, applied, to, a, chamber, containing, caesium, gas, which, absorbs, the, microwaves, the, output, current, of, the, caesium, chamber, increases, as, absorption, increases, the, remainder, of, the, circuitry, simply, adjusts, the, running, frequency, of, the, vcxo, to, maximize, the, output, current, of, the, caesium, chamber, which, keeps, the, oscillator, tuned, to, the, resonance, frequency, of, the, hyperfine, transition, the, bipm, defines, the, unperturbed, ground, state, hyperfine, transition, frequency, of, the, rubidium, 87, atom, 6, 834, 682, 610, 904, 312, 6, hz, in, terms, of, the, caesium, standard, frequency, atomic, clocks, based, on, rubidium, standards, are, therefore, regarded, as, secondary, representations, of, the, second, rubidium, standard, clocks, are, prized, for, their, low, cost, small, size, commercial, standards, are, as, small, as, 1, 7, 10, 5, mm, 3, and, short, term, stability, they, are, used, in, many, commercial, portable, and, aerospace, applications, modern, rubidium, standard, tubes, last, more, than, ten, years, and, can, cost, as, little, as, us, 50, some, commercial, applications, use, a, rubidium, standard, periodically, corrected, by, a, global, positioning, system, receiver, see, gps, disciplined, oscillator, this, achieves, excellent, short, term, accuracy, with, long, term, accuracy, equal, to, and, traceable, to, the, us, national, time, standards, the, bipm, defines, the, unperturbed, optical, transition, frequency, of, the, hydrogen, 1, neutral, atom, 1, 233, 030, 706, 593, 514, hz, in, terms, of, the, caesium, standard, frequency, atomic, clocks, based, on, hydrogen, standards, are, therefore, regarded, as, secondary, representations, of, the, second, hydrogen, masers, have, superior, short, term, stability, compared, to, other, standards, but, lower, long, term, accuracy, the, long, term, stability, of, hydrogen, maser, standards, decreases, because, of, changes, in, the, cavity, s, properties, over, time, the, relative, error, of, hydrogen, masers, is, 5, 10, 16, for, periods, of, 1000, seconds, this, makes, hydrogen, masers, good, for, radio, astronomy, in, particular, for, very, long, baseline, interferometry, hydrogen, masers, are, used, for, flywheel, oscillators, in, laser, cooled, atomic, frequency, standards, and, broadcasting, time, signals, from, national, standards, laboratories, although, they, need, to, be, corrected, as, they, drift, from, the, correct, frequency, over, time, the, hydrogen, maser, is, also, useful, for, experimental, tests, of, the, effects, of, special, relativity, and, general, relativity, such, as, gravitational, red, shift, since, 1968, the, si, has, defined, the, second, as, the, duration, of, 9, 192, 631, 770, cycles, of, radiation, corresponding, to, the, transition, between, two, energy, levels, of, the, ground, state, of, the, caesium, 133, atom, in, 1997, the, international, committee, for, weights, and, measures, cipm, added, that, the, preceding, definition, refers, to, a, caesium, atom, at, rest, at, a, temperature, of, absolute, zero, 113, this, definition, makes, the, caesium, oscillator, the, primary, standard, for, time, and, frequency, measurements, called, the, caesium, standard, following, the, 2019, revision, of, the, si, the, definition, of, every, base, unit, except, the, mole, and, almost, every, derived, unit, relies, on, the, definition, of, the, second, the, core, of, the, traditional, radio, frequency, atomic, clock, is, a, tunable, microwave, cavity, containing, a, gas, in, a, hydrogen, maser, clock, the, gas, emits, microwaves, the, gas, mases, on, a, hyperfine, transition, the, field, in, the, cavity, oscillates, and, the, cavity, is, tuned, for, maximum, microwave, amplitude, alternatively, in, a, caesium, or, rubidium, clock, the, beam, or, gas, absorbs, microwaves, and, the, cavity, contains, an, electronic, amplifier, to, make, it, oscillate, for, both, types, the, atoms, in, the, gas, are, prepared, in, one, hyperfine, state, prior, to, filling, them, into, the, cavity, for, the, second, type, the, number, of, atoms, that, change, hyperfine, state, is, detected, and, the, cavity, is, tuned, for, a, maximum, of, detected, state, changes, most, of, the, complexity, of, the, clock, lies, in, this, adjustment, process, the, adjustment, tries, to, correct, for, unwanted, side, effects, such, as, frequencies, from, other, electron, transitions, temperature, changes, and, the, spreading, in, frequencies, caused, by, the, vibration, of, molecules, including, doppler, broadening, one, way, of, doing, this, is, to, sweep, the, microwave, oscillator, s, frequency, across, a, narrow, range, to, generate, a, modulated, signal, at, the, detector, the, detector, s, signal, can, then, be, demodulated, to, apply, feedback, to, control, long, term, drift, in, the, radio, frequency, in, this, way, the, quantum, mechanical, properties, of, the, atomic, transition, frequency, of, the, caesium, can, be, used, to, tune, the, microwave, oscillator, to, the, same, frequency, except, for, a, small, amount, of, experimental, error, when, a, clock, is, first, turned, on, it, takes, a, while, for, the, oscillator, to, stabilize, in, practice, the, feedback, and, monitoring, mechanism, is, much, more, complex, many, of, the, newer, clocks, including, microwave, clocks, such, as, trapped, ion, or, fountain, clocks, and, optical, clocks, such, as, lattice, clocks, use, a, sequential, interrogation, protocol, rather, than, the, frequency, modulation, interrogation, described, above, an, advantage, of, sequential, interrogation, is, that, it, can, accommodate, much, higher, q, s, with, ringing, times, of, seconds, rather, than, milliseconds, these, clocks, also, typically, have, a, dead, time, during, which, the, atom, or, ion, collections, are, analyzed, renewed, and, driven, into, a, proper, quantum, state, after, which, they, are, interrogated, with, a, signal, from, a, local, oscillator, lo, for, a, time, of, perhaps, a, second, or, so, analysis, of, the, final, state, of, the, atoms, is, then, used, to, generate, a, correction, signal, to, keep, the, lo, frequency, locked, to, that, of, the, atoms, or, ions, all, timekeeping, devices, use, oscillatory, phenomena, to, accurately, measure, time, whether, it, is, the, rotation, of, the, earth, for, a, sundial, the, swinging, of, a, pendulum, in, a, grandfather, clock, the, vibrations, of, springs, and, gears, in, a, watch, or, voltage, changes, in, a, quartz, crystal, watch, however, all, of, these, are, easily, affected, by, temperature, changes, and, are, not, very, accurate, the, most, accurate, clocks, use, atomic, vibrations, to, keep, track, of, time, clock, transition, states, in, atoms, are, insensitive, to, temperature, and, other, environmental, factors, and, the, oscillation, frequency, is, much, higher, than, any, of, the, other, clocks, in, microwave, frequency, regime, and, higher, one, of, the, most, important, factors, in, a, clock, s, performance, is, the, atomic, line, quality, factor, q, which, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, absolute, frequency, 0, displaystyle, nu, 0, of, the, resonance, to, the, linewidth, of, the, resonance, itself, displaystyle, delta, nu, atomic, resonance, has, a, much, higher, q, than, mechanical, devices, atomic, clocks, can, also, be, isolated, from, environmental, effects, to, a, much, higher, degree, atomic, clocks, have, the, benefit, that, atoms, are, universal, which, means, that, the, oscillation, frequency, is, also, universal, this, is, different, from, quartz, and, mechanical, time, measurement, devices, that, do, not, have, a, universal, frequency, a, clock, s, quality, can, be, specified, by, two, parameters, accuracy, and, stability, accuracy, is, a, measurement, of, the, degree, to, which, the, clock, s, ticking, rate, can, be, counted, on, to, match, some, absolute, standard, such, as, the, inherent, hyperfine, frequency, of, an, isolated, atom, or, ion, stability, describes, how, the, clock, performs, when, averaged, over, time, to, reduce, the, impact, of, noise, and, other, short, term, fluctuations, see, precision, the, instability, of, an, atomic, clock, is, specified, by, its, allan, deviation, y, displaystyle, sigma, y, tau, the, limiting, instability, due, to, atom, or, ion, counting, statistics, is, given, by, where, displaystyle, delta, nu, is, the, spectroscopic, linewidth, of, the, clock, system, n, displaystyle, n, is, the, number, of, atoms, or, ions, used, in, a, single, measurement, t, c, displaystyle, t, text, c, is, the, time, required, for, one, cycle, and, displaystyle, tau, is, the, averaging, period, this, means, instability, is, smaller, when, the, linewidth, displaystyle, delta, nu, is, smaller, and, when, n, displaystyle, sqrt, n, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, is, larger, the, stability, improves, as, the, time, displaystyle, tau, over, which, the, measurements, are, averaged, increases, from, seconds, to, hours, to, days, the, stability, is, most, heavily, affected, by, the, oscillator, frequency, 0, displaystyle, nu, 0, this, is, why, optical, clocks, such, as, strontium, clocks, 429, terahertz, are, much, more, stable, than, caesium, clocks, 9, 19, ghz, modern, clocks, such, as, atomic, fountains, or, optical, lattices, that, use, sequential, interrogation, are, found, to, generate, type, of, noise, that, mimics, and, adds, to, the, instability, inherent, in, atom, or, ion, counting, this, effect, is, called, the, dick, effect, and, is, typically, the, primary, stability, limitation, for, the, newer, atomic, clocks, it, is, an, aliasing, effect, high, frequency, noise, components, in, the, local, oscillator, lo, are, heterodyned, to, near, zero, frequency, by, harmonics, of, the, repeating, variation, in, feedback, sensitivity, to, the, lo, frequency, the, effect, places, new, and, stringent, requirements, on, the, lo, which, must, now, have, low, phase, noise, in, addition, to, high, stability, thereby, increasing, the, cost, and, complexity, of, the, system, for, the, case, of, an, lo, with, flicker, frequency, noise, where, y, l, o, displaystyle, sigma, y, rm, lo, tau, is, independent, of, displaystyle, tau, the, interrogation, time, is, t, i, displaystyle, t, i, and, where, the, duty, factor, d, t, i, t, c, displaystyle, d, t, i, t, c, has, typical, values, 0, 4, d, 0, 7, displaystyle, 0, 4, d, 0, 7, the, allan, deviation, can, be, approximated, as, this, expression, shows, the, same, dependence, on, t, c, displaystyle, t, c, tau, as, does, y, a, t, o, m, s, displaystyle, sigma, y, rm, atoms, tau, and, for, many, of, the, newer, clocks, is, significantly, larger, analysis, of, the, effect, and, its, consequence, as, applied, to, optical, standards, has, been, treated, in, a, major, review, ludlow, et, al, 2015, that, lamented, on, the, pernicious, influence, of, the, dick, effect, and, in, several, other, papers, the, accuracy, of, atomic, clocks, has, improved, continuously, since, the, first, prototype, in, the, 1950s, the, first, generation, of, atomic, clocks, were, based, on, measuring, caesium, rubidium, and, hydrogen, atoms, in, a, time, period, from, 1959, to, 1998, nist, developed, a, series, of, seven, caesium, 133, microwave, clocks, named, nbs, 1, to, nbs, 6, and, nist, 7, after, the, agency, changed, its, name, from, the, national, bureau, of, standards, to, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, the, first, clock, had, an, accuracy, of, 10, 11, and, the, last, clock, had, an, accuracy, of, 10, 15, the, clocks, were, the, first, to, use, a, caesium, fountain, which, was, introduced, by, jerrod, zacharias, and, laser, cooling, of, atoms, which, was, demonstrated, by, dave, wineland, and, his, colleagues, in, 1978, the, next, step, in, atomic, clock, advances, involves, going, from, accuracies, of, 10, 15, to, accuracies, of, 10, 18, and, even, 10, 19, the, goal, is, to, redefine, the, second, when, clocks, become, so, accurate, that, they, will, not, lose, or, gain, more, than, a, second, in, the, age, of, the, universe, to, do, so, scientists, must, demonstrate, the, accuracy, of, clocks, that, use, strontium, and, ytterbium, and, optical, lattice, technology, such, clocks, are, also, called, optical, clocks, where, the, energy, level, transitions, used, are, in, the, optical, regime, giving, rise, to, even, higher, oscillation, frequency, which, thus, have, much, higher, accuracy, as, compared, to, traditional, atomic, clocks, the, goal, of, an, atomic, clock, with, 10, 16, accuracy, was, first, reached, at, the, united, kingdom, s, national, physical, laboratory, s, npl, csf2, caesium, fountain, clock, and, the, united, states, nist, f2, the, increase, in, precision, from, nist, f1, to, nist, f2, is, due, to, liquid, nitrogen, cooling, of, the, microwave, interaction, region, the, largest, source, of, uncertainty, in, nist, f1, is, the, effect, of, black, body, radiation, from, the, warm, chamber, walls, the, performance, of, primary, and, secondary, frequency, standards, contributing, to, international, atomic, time, tai, is, evaluated, the, evaluation, reports, of, individual, mainly, primary, clocks, are, published, online, by, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, most, research, focuses, on, the, often, conflicting, goals, of, making, the, clocks, smaller, cheaper, more, portable, more, energy, efficient, more, accurate, more, stable, and, more, reliable, the, cold, atom, clock, experiment, in, space, caces, testing, a, cold, atom, clock, in, earth, orbit, in, microgravity, conditions, and, the, atomic, clock, ensemble, in, space, are, examples, of, clock, research, a, list, of, frequencies, recommended, for, secondary, representations, of, the, second, is, maintained, by, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, since, 2006, and, is, available, online, the, list, contains, the, frequency, values, and, the, respective, standard, uncertainties, for, the, rubidium, microwave, transition, and, for, several, optical, transitions, these, secondary, frequency, standards, are, accurate, at, the, level, of, 10, 18, however, the, uncertainties, provided, in, the, list, are, in, the, range, 10, 14, 10, 15, since, they, are, limited, by, the, linking, to, the, caesium, primary, standard, that, currently, 2018, defines, the, second, twenty, first, century, experimental, atomic, clocks, that, provide, non, caesium, based, secondary, representations, of, the, second, are, becoming, so, precise, that, they, are, likely, to, be, used, as, extremely, sensitive, detectors, for, other, things, besides, measuring, frequency, and, time, for, example, the, frequency, of, atomic, clocks, is, altered, slightly, by, gravity, magnetic, fields, electrical, fields, force, motion, temperature, and, other, phenomena, the, experimental, clocks, tend, to, continue, to, improve, and, leadership, in, performance, has, shifted, back, and, forth, between, various, types, of, experimental, clocks, in, march, 2008, physicists, at, nist, described, a, quantum, logic, clock, based, on, individual, ions, of, beryllium, and, aluminium, this, clock, was, compared, to, nist, s, mercury, ion, clock, these, were, the, most, accurate, clocks, that, had, been, constructed, with, neither, clock, gaining, nor, losing, time, at, a, rate, that, would, exceed, a, second, in, over, a, billion, years, in, february, 2010, nist, physicists, described, a, second, enhanced, version, of, the, quantum, logic, clock, based, on, individual, ions, of, magnesium, and, aluminium, considered, the, world, s, most, precise, clock, in, 2010, with, a, fractional, frequency, inaccuracy, of, 8, 6, 10, 18, it, offers, more, than, twice, the, precision, of, the, original, in, july, 2019, nist, scientists, demonstrated, such, an, al, quantum, logic, clock, with, total, uncertainty, of, 9, 4, 10, 19, which, is, the, first, demonstration, of, such, a, clock, with, uncertainty, below, 10, 18, and, remains, the, most, accurate, clock, in, the, world, the, accuracy, of, experimental, quantum, clocks, has, since, been, superseded, by, experimental, optical, lattice, clocks, based, on, strontium, 87, and, ytterbium, 171, one, theoretical, possibility, for, improving, the, performance, of, atomic, clocks, is, to, use, a, nuclear, energy, transition, between, different, nuclear, isomers, rather, than, the, atomic, electron, transitions, which, current, atomic, clocks, measure, most, nuclear, transitions, operate, at, far, too, high, a, frequency, to, be, measured, but, the, exceptionally, low, excitation, energy, of, 229m, th, produces, gamma, rays, in, the, ultraviolet, frequency, range, in, 2003, ekkehard, peik, and, christian, tamm, noted, this, makes, a, clock, possible, with, current, optical, frequency, measurement, techniques, in, 2012, it, was, shown, that, a, nuclear, clock, based, on, a, single, 229, th, 3, ion, could, provide, a, total, fractional, frequency, inaccuracy, of, 1, 5, 10, 19, which, was, better, than, existing, 2019, optical, atomic, clock, technology, although, a, precise, clock, remains, an, unrealized, theoretical, possibility, efforts, through, the, 2010s, to, measure, the, transition, energy, culminated, in, the, 2024, measurement, of, the, optical, frequency, with, sufficient, accuracy, 2, 020, 407, 384, 335, 2, khz, 2, 020, 407, 384, 335, 2, 10, 15, hz, that, an, experimental, optical, nuclear, clock, can, now, be, constructed, although, neutral, 229m, th, atoms, decay, in, microseconds, by, internal, conversion, this, pathway, is, energetically, prohibited, in, 229m, th, ions, as, the, second, and, higher, ionization, energy, is, greater, than, the, nuclear, excitation, energy, giving, 229m, th, ions, a, long, half, life, on, the, order, of, 10, 3, s, it, is, the, large, ratio, between, transition, frequency, and, isomer, lifetime, which, gives, the, clock, a, high, quality, factor, a, nuclear, energy, transition, offers, the, following, potential, advantages, in, june, 2015, the, national, physical, laboratory, npl, in, teddington, uk, the, french, department, of, time, space, reference, systems, at, the, paris, observatory, lne, syrte, the, german, german, national, metrology, institute, ptb, in, braunschweig, and, italy, s, istituto, nazionale, di, ricerca, metrologica, inrim, in, turin, labs, have, started, tests, to, improve, the, accuracy, of, current, state, of, the, art, satellite, comparisons, by, a, factor, of, 10, but, it, will, still, be, limited, to, one, part, in, 1, these, four, european, labs, are, developing, and, host, a, variety, of, experimental, optical, clocks, that, harness, different, elements, in, different, experimental, set, ups, and, want, to, compare, their, optical, clocks, against, each, other, and, check, whether, they, agree, in, a, next, phase, these, labs, strive, to, transmit, comparison, signals, in, the, visible, spectrum, through, fibre, optic, cables, this, will, allow, their, experimental, optical, clocks, to, be, compared, with, an, accuracy, similar, to, the, expected, accuracies, of, the, optical, clocks, themselves, some, of, these, labs, have, already, established, fibre, optic, links, and, tests, have, begun, on, sections, between, paris, and, teddington, and, paris, and, braunschweig, fibre, optic, links, between, experimental, optical, clocks, also, exist, between, the, american, nist, lab, and, its, partner, lab, jila, both, in, boulder, colorado, but, these, span, much, shorter, distances, than, the, european, network, and, are, between, just, two, labs, according, to, fritz, riehle, a, physicist, at, ptb, europe, is, in, a, unique, position, as, it, has, a, high, density, of, the, best, clocks, in, the, world, in, august, 2016, the, french, lne, syrte, in, paris, and, the, german, ptb, in, braunschweig, reported, the, comparison, and, agreement, of, two, fully, independent, experimental, strontium, lattice, optical, clocks, in, paris, and, braunschweig, at, an, uncertainty, of, 5, 10, 17, via, a, newly, established, phase, coherent, frequency, link, connecting, paris, and, braunschweig, using, 1, 415, km, 879, mi, of, telecom, fibre, optic, cable, the, fractional, uncertainty, of, the, whole, link, was, assessed, to, be, 2, 5, 10, 19, making, comparisons, of, even, more, accurate, clocks, possible, in, 2021, nist, compared, transmission, of, signals, from, a, series, of, experimental, atomic, clocks, located, about, 1, 5, km, 1, mi, apart, at, the, nist, lab, its, partner, lab, jila, and, the, university, of, colorado, all, in, boulder, colorado, over, air, and, fiber, optic, cable, to, a, precision, of, 8, 10, 18, the, idea, of, trapping, atoms, in, an, optical, lattice, using, lasers, was, proposed, by, russian, physicist, vladilen, letokhov, in, the, 1960s, the, theoretical, move, from, microwaves, as, the, atomic, escapement, for, clocks, to, light, in, the, optical, range, harder, to, measure, but, offering, better, performance, earned, john, l, hall, and, theodor, w, h, nsch, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 2005, one, of, 2012, s, physics, nobelists, david, j, wineland, is, a, pioneer, in, exploiting, the, properties, of, a, single, ion, held, in, a, trap, to, develop, clocks, of, the, highest, stability, the, development, of, the, first, optical, clock, was, started, at, nist, in, 2000, and, finished, in, 2006, see, for, a, review, up, to, 2020, the, development, of, femtosecond, frequency, combs, optical, lattices, has, led, to, a, new, generation, of, atomic, clocks, these, clocks, are, based, on, atomic, transitions, that, emit, visible, light, instead, of, microwaves, a, major, obstacle, to, developing, an, optical, clock, is, the, difficulty, of, directly, measuring, optical, frequencies, this, problem, has, been, solved, with, the, development, of, self, referenced, mode, locked, lasers, commonly, referred, to, as, femtosecond, frequency, combs, before, the, demonstration, of, the, frequency, comb, in, 2000, terahertz, techniques, were, needed, to, bridge, the, gap, between, radio, and, optical, frequencies, and, the, systems, for, doing, so, were, cumbersome, and, complicated, with, the, refinement, of, the, frequency, comb, these, measurements, have, become, much, more, accessible, and, numerous, optical, clock, systems, are, now, being, developed, around, the, world, as, in, the, radio, range, absorption, spectroscopy, is, used, to, stabilize, an, oscillator, in, this, case, a, laser, when, the, optical, frequency, is, divided, down, into, a, countable, radio, frequency, using, a, femtosecond, comb, the, bandwidth, of, the, phase, noise, is, also, divided, by, that, factor, although, the, bandwidth, of, laser, phase, noise, is, generally, greater, than, stable, microwave, sources, after, division, it, is, less, the, primary, systems, under, consideration, for, use, in, optical, frequency, standards, are, these, techniques, allow, the, atoms, or, ions, to, be, highly, isolated, from, external, perturbations, thus, producing, an, extremely, stable, frequency, reference, lasers, and, magneto, optical, traps, are, used, to, cool, the, atoms, for, improved, precision, atomic, systems, under, consideration, include, al, hg, 2, hg, sr, sr, 2, in, 3, mg, ca, ca, yb, 2, 3, yb, and, th, 3, the, color, of, a, clock, s, electromagnetic, radiation, depends, on, the, element, that, is, stimulated, for, example, calcium, optical, clocks, resonate, when, red, light, is, produced, and, ytterbium, clocks, resonate, in, the, presence, of, violet, light, the, rare, earth, element, ytterbium, yb, is, valued, not, so, much, for, its, mechanical, properties, but, for, its, complement, of, internal, energy, levels, a, particular, transition, in, yb, atoms, at, a, wavelength, of, 578, nm, currently, provides, one, of, the, world, s, most, accurate, optical, atomic, frequency, standards, said, marianna, safronova, the, estimated, uncertainty, achieved, corresponds, to, about, one, second, over, the, lifetime, of, the, universe, so, far, 15, billion, years, according, to, scientists, at, the, joint, quantum, institute, jqi, and, the, university, of, delaware, in, december, 2012, in, 2013, optical, lattice, clocks, olcs, were, shown, to, be, as, good, as, or, better, than, caesium, fountain, clocks, two, optical, lattice, clocks, containing, about, 10, 000, atoms, of, strontium, 87, were, able, to, stay, in, synchrony, with, each, other, at, a, precision, of, at, least, 1, 5, 10, 16, which, is, as, accurate, as, the, experiment, could, measure, these, clocks, have, been, shown, to, keep, pace, with, all, three, of, the, caesium, fountain, clocks, at, the, paris, observatory, there, are, two, reasons, for, the, possibly, better, precision, firstly, the, frequency, is, measured, using, light, which, has, a, much, higher, frequency, than, microwaves, and, secondly, by, using, many, atoms, any, errors, are, averaged, using, ytterbium, 171, atoms, a, new, record, for, stability, with, a, precision, of, 1, 6, 10, 18, over, a, 7, hour, period, was, published, on, 22, august, 2013, at, this, stability, the, two, optical, lattice, clocks, working, independently, from, each, other, used, by, the, nist, research, team, would, differ, less, than, a, second, over, the, age, of, the, universe, 13, 8, 10, 9, years, this, was, 10, times, better, than, previous, experiments, the, clocks, rely, on, 10, 000, ytterbium, atoms, cooled, to, 10, microkelvin, and, trapped, in, an, optical, lattice, a, laser, at, 578, nm, excites, the, atoms, between, two, of, their, energy, levels, having, established, the, stability, of, the, clocks, the, researchers, are, studying, external, influences, and, evaluating, the, remaining, systematic, uncertainties, in, the, hope, that, they, can, bring, the, clock, s, accuracy, down, to, the, level, of, its, stability, an, improved, optical, lattice, clock, was, described, in, a, 2014, nature, paper, in, 2015, jila, evaluated, the, absolute, frequency, uncertainty, of, a, strontium, 87, optical, lattice, clock, at, 2, 1, 10, 18, which, corresponds, to, a, measurable, gravitational, time, dilation, for, an, elevation, change, of, 2, cm, 0, 79, in, on, planet, earth, that, according, to, jila, nist, fellow, jun, ye, is, getting, really, close, to, being, useful, for, relativistic, geodesy, at, this, frequency, uncertainty, this, jila, optical, lattice, clock, is, expected, to, neither, gain, nor, lose, a, second, in, more, than, 15, billion, years, in, 2017, jila, reported, an, experimental, 3d, quantum, gas, strontium, optical, lattice, clock, in, which, strontium, 87, atoms, are, packed, into, a, tiny, three, dimensional, 3, d, cube, at, 1, 000, times, the, density, of, previous, one, dimensional, 1, d, clocks, such, as, the, 2015, jila, clock, a, comparison, between, two, regions, of, the, same, 3d, lattice, yielded, a, residual, precision, of, 5, 10, 19, in, 1, hour, of, averaging, time, this, precision, value, does, not, represent, the, absolute, accuracy, or, precision, of, the, clock, which, remain, above, 1, 10, 18, and, 1, 10, 17, respectively, the, 3d, quantum, gas, strontium, optical, lattice, clock, s, centerpiece, is, an, unusual, state, of, matter, called, a, degenerate, fermi, gas, a, quantum, gas, for, fermi, particles, the, experimental, data, shows, the, 3d, quantum, gas, clock, achieved, a, residual, precision, of, 3, 5, 10, 19, in, about, two, hours, according, to, jun, ye, this, represents, a, significant, improvement, over, any, previous, demonstrations, ye, further, commented, the, most, important, potential, of, the, 3d, quantum, gas, clock, is, the, ability, to, scale, up, the, atom, numbers, which, will, lead, to, a, huge, gain, in, stability, and, the, ability, to, scale, up, both, the, atom, number, and, coherence, time, will, make, this, new, generation, clock, qualitatively, different, from, the, previous, generation, in, 2018, jila, reported, the, 3d, quantum, gas, clock, reached, a, residual, frequency, precision, of, 2, 5, 10, 19, over, 6, hours, recently, it, has, been, proved, that, the, quantum, entanglement, can, help, to, further, enhance, the, clock, stability, in, 2020, optical, clocks, were, researched, for, space, applications, like, future, generations, of, global, navigation, satellite, systems, gnsss, as, replacements, for, microwave, based, clocks, ye, s, strontium, 87, clock, has, not, surpassed, the, aluminum, 27, or, ytterbium, 171, optical, clocks, in, terms, of, frequency, accuracy, in, february, 2022, scientists, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, reported, a, multiplexed, optical, atomic, clock, where, individual, clocks, deviated, from, each, other, with, an, accuracy, equivalent, to, losing, a, second, in, 300, billion, years, the, reported, minor, deviation, is, explainable, as, the, concerned, clock, oscillators, are, in, slightly, different, environments, these, are, causing, differing, reactions, to, gravity, magnetic, fields, or, other, conditions, this, miniaturized, clock, network, approach, is, novel, in, that, it, uses, an, optical, lattice, of, strontium, atoms, and, a, configuration, of, six, clocks, that, can, be, used, to, demonstrate, relative, stability, fractional, uncertainty, between, clocks, and, methods, for, ultra, high, precision, comparisons, between, optical, atomic, clock, ensembles, that, are, located, close, together, in, a, metrology, facility, optical, clocks, are, currently, 2022, still, primarily, research, projects, less, mature, than, rubidium, and, caesium, microwave, standards, which, regularly, deliver, time, to, the, international, bureau, of, weights, and, measures, bipm, for, establishing, international, atomic, time, tai, as, the, optical, experimental, clocks, move, beyond, their, microwave, counterparts, in, terms, of, accuracy, and, stability, performance, this, puts, them, in, a, position, to, replace, the, current, standard, for, time, the, caesium, fountain, clock, in, the, future, this, might, lead, to, redefining, the, caesium, microwave, based, si, second, and, other, new, dissemination, techniques, at, the, highest, level, of, accuracy, to, transfer, clock, signals, will, be, required, that, can, be, used, in, both, shorter, range, and, longer, range, frequency, comparisons, between, better, clocks, and, to, explore, their, fundamental, limitations, without, significantly, compromising, their, performance, the, bipm, reported, in, december, 2021, based, on, the, progress, of, optical, standards, contributing, to, tai, the, consultative, committee, for, time, and, frequency, cctf, initiated, work, towards, a, redefinition, of, the, second, expected, during, the, 2030s, in, july, 2022, atomic, optical, clocks, based, on, iodine, molecules, were, demonstrated, at, sea, on, a, naval, vessel, and, operated, continuously, in, the, pacific, ocean, for, 20, days, in, the, exercise, rimpac, 2022, these, technologies, originally, funded, by, the, u, s, department, of, defense, have, led, to, the, world, s, first, commercial, rackmount, optical, clock, in, november, 2023, the, most, accurate, caesium, clocks, based, on, the, caesium, frequency, of, 9, 19, ghz, have, an, accuracy, between, 10, 15, 10, 16, unfortunately, they, are, big, and, only, available, in, large, metrology, labs, and, not, useful, for, factories, or, industrial, environments, that, would, use, an, atomic, clock, for, gps, accuracy, but, cannot, afford, to, build, a, whole, metrology, laboratory, for, one, atomic, clock, researchers, have, designed, a, strontium, optical, clock, that, can, be, moved, around, in, an, air, conditioned, car, trailer, in, 2022, the, best, realisation, of, the, second, is, done, with, caesium, primary, standard, clocks, such, as, it, csf2, nist, f2, npl, csf2, ptb, csf2, su, csfo2, or, syrte, fo2, these, clocks, work, by, laser, cooling, a, cloud, of, caesium, atoms, to, a, microkelvin, in, a, magneto, optic, trap, these, cold, atoms, are, then, launched, vertically, by, laser, light, the, atoms, then, undergo, ramsey, excitation, in, a, microwave, cavity, the, fraction, of, excited, atoms, are, then, detected, by, laser, beams, these, clocks, have, 5, 10, 16, systematic, uncertainty, which, is, equivalent, to, 50, picoseconds, per, day, a, system, of, several, fountains, worldwide, contributes, to, international, atomic, time, these, caesium, clocks, also, underpin, optical, frequency, measurements, the, advantage, of, optical, clocks, can, be, explained, by, the, statement, that, the, instability, f, f, 1, s, n, displaystyle, sigma, propto, frac, delta, f, f, frac, 1, s, n, where, displaystyle, sigma, is, the, instability, f, is, the, frequency, and, s, n, is, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, this, leads, to, the, equation, 1, 2, f, n, t, i, n, t, displaystyle, sigma, tau, frac, 1, 2, pi, f, sqrt, nt, int, tau, optical, clocks, are, based, on, forbidden, optical, transitions, in, ions, or, atoms, they, have, frequencies, around, 10, 15, hz, with, a, natural, linewidth, f, displaystyle, delta, f, of, typically, 1, hz, so, the, q, factor, is, about, 10, 15, or, even, higher, they, have, better, stabilities, than, microwave, clocks, which, means, that, they, can, facilitate, evaluation, of, lower, uncertainties, they, also, have, better, time, resolution, which, means, the, clock, ticks, faster, optical, clocks, use, either, a, single, ion, or, an, optical, lattice, with, 10, 4, 10, 6, atoms, a, definition, based, on, the, rydberg, constant, would, involve, fixing, the, value, to, a, certain, value, r, m, e, e, 4, 8, 0, 2, h, 3, c, m, e, c, 2, 2, h, displaystyle, r, infty, frac, m, e, e, 4, 8, varepsilon, 0, 2, h, 3, c, frac, m, e, c, alpha, 2, 2h, the, rydberg, constant, describes, the, energy, levels, in, a, hydrogen, atom, with, the, nonrelativistic, approximation, e, n, r, c, h, n, 2, displaystyle, e, n, approx, frac, r, infty, ch, n, 2, the, only, viable, way, to, fix, the, rydberg, constant, involves, trapping, and, cooling, hydrogen, unfortunately, this, is, difficult, because, it, is, very, light, and, the, atoms, move, very, fast, causing, doppler, shifts, the, radiation, needed, to, cool, the, hydrogen, 121, 5, nm, is, also, difficult, another, hurdle, involves, improving, the, uncertainty, in, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, calculations, in, the, report, of, the, 25th, meeting, of, the, consultative, committee, for, units, 2021, 3, options, were, considered, for, the, redefinition, of, the, second, sometime, around, 2026, 2030, or, 2034, the, first, redefinition, approach, considered, was, a, definition, based, on, a, single, atomic, reference, transition, the, second, redefinition, approach, considered, was, a, definition, based, on, a, collection, of, frequencies, the, third, redefinition, approach, considered, was, a, definition, based, on, fixing, the, numerical, value, of, a, fundamental, constant, such, as, making, the, rydberg, constant, the, basis, for, the, definition, the, committee, concluded, there, was, no, feasible, way, to, redefine, the, second, with, the, third, option, since, no, physical, constant, is, known, to, enough, digits, currently, to, enable, realizing, the, second, with, a, constant, a, redefinition, must, include, improved, optical, clock, reliability, tai, must, be, contributed, to, by, optical, clocks, before, the, bipm, affirms, a, redefinition, a, consistent, method, of, sending, signals, such, as, fiber, optics, must, be, developed, before, the, second, is, redefined, the, development, of, atomic, clocks, has, led, to, many, scientific, and, technological, advances, such, as, precise, global, and, regional, navigation, satellite, systems, and, applications, in, the, internet, which, depend, critically, on, frequency, and, time, standards, atomic, clocks, are, installed, at, sites, of, time, signal, radio, transmitters, they, are, used, at, some, long, wave, and, medium, wave, broadcasting, stations, to, deliver, a, very, precise, carrier, frequency, atomic, clocks, are, used, in, many, scientific, disciplines, such, as, for, long, baseline, interferometry, in, radio, astronomy, the, global, positioning, system, gps, operated, by, the, united, states, space, force, provides, very, accurate, timing, and, frequency, signals, a, gps, receiver, works, by, measuring, the, relative, time, delay, of, signals, from, a, minimum, of, four, but, usually, more, gps, satellites, each, of, which, has, at, least, two, onboard, caesium, and, as, many, as, two, rubidium, atomic, clocks, the, relative, times, are, mathematically,
