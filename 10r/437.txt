a, communications, satellite, is, an, artificial, satellite, that, relays, and, amplifies, radio, telecommunication, signals, via, a, transponder, it, creates, a, communication, channel, between, a, source, transmitter, and, a, receiver, at, different, locations, on, earth, communications, satellites, are, used, for, television, telephone, radio, internet, and, military, applications, many, communications, satellites, are, in, geostationary, orbit, 22, 236, miles, 35, 785, km, above, the, equator, so, that, the, satellite, appears, stationary, at, the, same, point, in, the, sky, therefore, the, satellite, dish, antennas, of, ground, stations, can, be, aimed, permanently, at, that, spot, and, do, not, have, to, move, to, track, the, satellite, others, form, satellite, constellations, in, low, earth, orbit, where, antennas, on, the, ground, have, to, follow, the, position, of, the, satellites, and, switch, between, satellites, frequently, the, radio, waves, used, for, telecommunications, links, travel, by, line, of, sight, and, so, are, obstructed, by, the, curve, of, the, earth, the, purpose, of, communications, satellites, is, to, relay, the, signal, around, the, curve, of, the, earth, allowing, communication, between, widely, separated, geographical, points, communications, satellites, use, a, wide, range, of, radio, and, microwave, frequencies, to, avoid, signal, interference, international, organizations, have, regulations, for, which, frequency, ranges, or, bands, certain, organizations, are, allowed, to, use, this, allocation, of, bands, minimizes, the, risk, of, signal, interference, in, october, 1945, arthur, c, clarke, published, an, article, titled, extraterrestrial, relays, in, the, british, magazine, wireless, world, the, article, described, the, fundamentals, behind, the, deployment, of, artificial, satellites, in, geostationary, orbits, to, relay, radio, signals, because, of, this, arthur, c, clarke, is, often, quoted, as, being, the, inventor, of, the, concept, of, the, communications, satellite, and, the, term, clarke, belt, is, employed, as, a, description, of, the, orbit, the, first, artificial, earth, satellite, was, sputnik, 1, which, was, put, into, orbit, by, the, soviet, union, on, 4, october, 1957, it, was, developed, by, mikhail, tikhonravov, and, sergey, korolev, building, on, work, by, konstantin, tsiolkovsky, sputnik, 1, was, equipped, with, an, on, board, radio, transmitter, that, worked, on, two, frequencies, of, 20, 005, and, 40, 002, mhz, or, 7, and, 15, meters, wavelength, the, satellite, was, not, placed, in, orbit, to, send, data, from, one, point, on, earth, to, another, but, the, radio, transmitter, was, meant, to, study, the, properties, of, radio, wave, distribution, throughout, the, ionosphere, the, launch, of, sputnik, 1, was, a, major, step, in, the, exploration, of, space, and, rocket, development, and, marks, the, beginning, of, the, space, age, there, are, two, major, classes, of, communications, satellites, passive, and, active, passive, satellites, only, reflect, the, signal, coming, from, the, source, toward, the, direction, of, the, receiver, with, passive, satellites, the, reflected, signal, is, not, amplified, at, the, satellite, and, only, a, small, amount, of, the, transmitted, energy, actually, reaches, the, receiver, since, the, satellite, is, so, far, above, earth, the, radio, signal, is, attenuated, due, to, free, space, path, loss, so, the, signal, received, on, earth, is, very, weak, active, satellites, on, the, other, hand, amplify, the, received, signal, before, retransmitting, it, to, the, receiver, on, the, ground, passive, satellites, were, the, first, communications, satellites, but, are, little, used, now, work, that, was, begun, in, the, field, of, electrical, intelligence, gathering, at, the, united, states, naval, research, laboratory, in, 1951, led, to, a, project, named, communication, moon, relay, military, planners, had, long, shown, considerable, interest, in, secure, and, reliable, communications, lines, as, a, tactical, necessity, and, the, ultimate, goal, of, this, project, was, the, creation, of, the, longest, communications, circuit, in, human, history, with, the, moon, earth, s, natural, satellite, acting, as, a, passive, relay, after, achieving, the, first, transoceanic, communication, between, washington, d, c, and, hawaii, on, 23, january, 1956, this, system, was, publicly, inaugurated, and, put, into, formal, production, in, january, 1960, the, first, satellite, purpose, built, to, actively, relay, communications, was, project, score, led, by, advanced, research, projects, agency, arpa, and, launched, on, 18, december, 1958, which, used, a, tape, recorder, to, carry, a, stored, voice, message, as, well, as, to, receive, store, and, retransmit, messages, it, was, used, to, send, a, christmas, greeting, to, the, world, from, u, s, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, the, satellite, also, executed, several, realtime, transmissions, before, the, non, rechargeable, batteries, failed, on, 30, december, 1958, after, eight, hours, of, actual, operation, the, direct, successor, to, score, was, another, arpa, led, project, called, courier, courier, 1b, was, launched, on, 4, october, 1960, to, explore, whether, it, would, be, possible, to, establish, a, global, military, communications, network, by, using, delayed, repeater, satellites, which, receive, and, store, information, until, commanded, to, rebroadcast, them, after, 17, days, a, command, system, failure, ended, communications, from, the, satellite, nasa, s, satellite, applications, program, launched, the, first, artificial, satellite, used, for, passive, relay, communications, in, echo, 1, on, 12, august, 1960, echo, 1, was, an, aluminized, balloon, satellite, acting, as, a, passive, reflector, of, microwave, signals, communication, signals, were, bounced, off, the, satellite, from, one, point, on, earth, to, another, this, experiment, sought, to, establish, the, feasibility, of, worldwide, broadcasts, of, telephone, radio, and, television, signals, telstar, was, the, first, active, direct, relay, communications, commercial, satellite, and, marked, the, first, transatlantic, transmission, of, television, signals, belonging, to, at, t, as, part, of, a, multi, national, agreement, between, at, t, bell, telephone, laboratories, nasa, the, british, general, post, office, and, the, french, national, ptt, post, office, to, develop, satellite, communications, it, was, launched, by, nasa, from, cape, canaveral, on, 10, july, 1962, in, the, first, privately, sponsored, space, launch, another, passive, relay, experiment, primarily, intended, for, military, communications, purposes, was, project, west, ford, which, was, led, by, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, s, lincoln, laboratory, after, an, initial, failure, in, 1961, a, launch, on, 9, may, 1963, dispersed, 350, million, copper, needle, dipoles, to, create, a, passive, reflecting, belt, even, though, only, about, half, of, the, dipoles, properly, separated, from, each, other, the, project, was, able, to, successfully, experiment, and, communicate, using, frequencies, in, the, shf, x, band, spectrum, an, immediate, antecedent, of, the, geostationary, satellites, was, the, hughes, aircraft, company, s, syncom, 2, launched, on, 26, july, 1963, syncom, 2, was, the, first, communications, satellite, in, a, geosynchronous, orbit, it, revolved, around, the, earth, once, per, day, at, constant, speed, but, because, it, still, had, north, south, motion, special, equipment, was, needed, to, track, it, its, successor, syncom, 3, launched, on, 19, july, 1964, was, the, first, geostationary, communications, satellite, syncom, 3, obtained, a, geosynchronous, orbit, without, a, north, south, motion, making, it, appear, from, the, ground, as, a, stationary, object, in, the, sky, a, direct, extension, of, the, passive, experiments, of, project, west, ford, was, the, lincoln, experimental, satellite, program, also, conducted, by, the, lincoln, laboratory, on, behalf, of, the, united, states, department, of, defense, the, les, 1, active, communications, satellite, was, launched, on, 11, february, 1965, to, explore, the, feasibility, of, active, solid, state, x, band, long, range, military, communications, a, total, of, nine, satellites, were, launched, between, 1965, and, 1976, as, part, of, this, series, in, the, united, states, 1962, saw, the, creation, of, the, communications, satellite, corporation, comsat, private, corporation, which, was, subject, to, instruction, by, the, us, government, on, matters, of, national, policy, over, the, next, two, years, international, negotiations, led, to, the, intelsat, agreements, which, in, turn, led, to, the, launch, of, intelsat, 1, also, known, as, early, bird, on, 6, april, 1965, and, which, was, the, first, commercial, communications, satellite, to, be, placed, in, geosynchronous, orbit, subsequent, intelsat, launches, in, the, 1960s, provided, multi, destination, service, and, video, audio, and, data, service, to, ships, at, sea, intelsat, 2, in, 1966, 67, and, the, completion, of, a, fully, global, network, with, intelsat, 3, in, 1969, 70, by, the, 1980s, with, significant, expansions, in, commercial, satellite, capacity, intelsat, was, on, its, way, to, become, part, of, the, competitive, private, telecommunications, industry, and, had, started, to, get, competition, from, the, likes, of, panamsat, in, the, united, states, which, ironically, was, then, bought, by, its, archrival, in, 2005, when, intelsat, was, launched, the, united, states, was, the, only, launch, source, outside, of, the, soviet, union, who, did, not, participate, in, the, intelsat, agreements, the, soviet, union, launched, its, first, communications, satellite, on, 23, april, 1965, as, part, of, the, molniya, program, this, program, was, also, unique, at, the, time, for, its, use, of, what, then, became, known, as, the, molniya, orbit, which, describes, a, highly, elliptical, orbit, with, two, high, apogees, daily, over, the, northern, hemisphere, this, orbit, provides, a, long, dwell, time, over, russian, territory, as, well, as, over, canada, at, higher, latitudes, than, geostationary, orbits, over, the, equator, communications, satellites, usually, have, one, of, three, primary, types, of, orbit, while, other, orbital, classifications, are, used, to, further, specify, orbital, details, meo, and, leo, are, non, geostationary, orbit, ngso, as, satellites, in, meo, and, leo, orbit, the, earth, faster, they, do, not, remain, visible, in, the, sky, to, a, fixed, point, on, earth, continually, like, a, geostationary, satellite, but, appear, to, a, ground, observer, to, cross, the, sky, and, set, when, they, go, behind, the, earth, beyond, the, visible, horizon, therefore, to, provide, continuous, communications, capability, with, these, lower, orbits, requires, a, larger, number, of, satellites, so, that, one, of, these, satellites, will, always, be, visible, in, the, sky, for, transmission, of, communication, signals, however, due, to, their, closer, distance, to, the, earth, leo, or, meo, satellites, can, communicate, to, ground, with, reduced, latency, and, at, lower, power, than, would, be, required, from, a, geosynchronous, orbit, a, low, earth, orbit, leo, typically, is, a, circular, orbit, about, 160, to, 2, 000, kilometres, 99, to, 1, 243, mi, above, the, earth, s, surface, and, correspondingly, a, period, time, to, revolve, around, the, earth, of, about, 90, minutes, because, of, their, low, altitude, these, satellites, are, only, visible, from, within, a, radius, of, roughly, 1, 000, kilometres, 620, mi, from, the, sub, satellite, point, in, addition, satellites, in, low, earth, orbit, change, their, position, relative, to, the, ground, position, quickly, so, even, for, local, applications, many, satellites, are, needed, if, the, mission, requires, uninterrupted, connectivity, low, earth, orbiting, satellites, are, less, expensive, to, launch, into, orbit, than, geostationary, satellites, and, due, to, proximity, to, the, ground, do, not, require, as, high, signal, strength, signal, strength, falls, off, as, the, square, of, the, distance, from, the, source, so, the, effect, is, considerable, thus, there, is, a, trade, off, between, the, number, of, satellites, and, their, cost, in, addition, there, are, important, differences, in, the, onboard, and, ground, equipment, needed, to, support, the, two, types, of, missions, a, group, of, satellites, working, in, concert, is, known, as, a, satellite, constellation, two, such, constellations, intended, to, provide, satellite, phone, and, low, speed, data, services, primarily, to, remote, areas, are, the, iridium, and, globalstar, systems, the, iridium, system, has, 66, satellites, which, orbital, inclination, of, 86, 4, and, inter, satellite, links, provide, service, availability, over, the, entire, surface, of, earth, starlink, is, a, satellite, internet, constellation, operated, by, spacex, that, aims, for, global, satellite, internet, access, coverage, it, is, also, possible, to, offer, discontinuous, coverage, using, a, low, earth, orbit, satellite, capable, of, storing, data, received, while, passing, over, one, part, of, earth, and, transmitting, it, later, while, passing, over, another, part, this, will, be, the, case, with, the, cascade, system, of, canada, s, cassiope, communications, satellite, another, system, using, this, store, and, forward, method, is, orbcomm, a, medium, earth, orbit, is, a, satellite, in, orbit, somewhere, between, 2, 000, and, 35, 786, kilometres, 1, 243, and, 22, 236, mi, above, the, earth, s, surface, meo, satellites, are, similar, to, leo, satellites, in, functionality, meo, satellites, are, visible, for, much, longer, periods, of, time, than, leo, satellites, usually, between, 2, and, 8, hours, meo, satellites, have, a, larger, coverage, area, than, leo, satellites, a, meo, satellite, s, longer, duration, of, visibility, and, wider, footprint, means, fewer, satellites, are, needed, in, a, meo, network, than, a, leo, network, one, disadvantage, is, that, a, meo, satellite, s, distance, gives, it, a, longer, time, delay, and, weaker, signal, than, a, leo, satellite, although, these, limitations, are, not, as, severe, as, those, of, a, geo, satellite, like, leos, these, satellites, do, not, maintain, a, stationary, distance, from, the, earth, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, geostationary, orbit, where, satellites, are, always, 35, 786, kilometres, 22, 236, mi, from, earth, typically, the, orbit, of, a, medium, earth, orbit, satellite, is, about, 16, 000, kilometres, 10, 000, mi, above, earth, in, various, patterns, these, satellites, make, the, trip, around, earth, in, anywhere, from, 2, to, 8, hours, to, an, observer, on, earth, a, satellite, in, a, gestationary, orbit, appears, motionless, in, a, fixed, position, in, the, sky, this, is, because, it, revolves, around, the, earth, at, earth, s, own, angular, velocity, one, revolution, per, sidereal, day, in, an, equatorial, orbit, a, geostationary, orbit, is, useful, for, communications, because, ground, antennas, can, be, aimed, at, the, satellite, without, their, having, to, track, the, satellite, s, motion, this, is, relatively, inexpensive, in, applications, that, require, many, ground, antennas, such, as, directv, distribution, the, savings, in, ground, equipment, can, more, than, outweigh, the, cost, and, complexity, of, placing, a, satellite, into, orbit, by, 2000, hughes, space, and, communications, now, boeing, satellite, development, center, had, built, nearly, 40, percent, of, the, more, than, one, hundred, satellites, in, service, worldwide, other, major, satellite, manufacturers, include, space, systems, loral, orbital, sciences, corporation, with, the, star, bus, series, indian, space, research, organisation, lockheed, martin, owns, the, former, rca, astro, electronics, ge, astro, space, business, northrop, grumman, alcatel, space, now, thales, alenia, space, with, the, spacebus, series, and, astrium, geostationary, satellites, must, operate, above, the, equator, and, therefore, appear, lower, on, the, horizon, as, the, receiver, gets, farther, from, the, equator, this, will, cause, problems, for, extreme, northerly, latitudes, affecting, connectivity, and, causing, multipath, interference, caused, by, signals, reflecting, off, the, ground, and, into, the, ground, antenna, thus, for, areas, close, to, the, north, and, south, pole, a, geostationary, satellite, may, appear, below, the, horizon, therefore, molniya, orbit, satellites, have, been, launched, mainly, in, russia, to, alleviate, this, problem, molniya, orbits, can, be, an, appealing, alternative, in, such, cases, the, molniya, orbit, is, highly, inclined, guaranteeing, good, elevation, over, selected, positions, during, the, northern, portion, of, the, orbit, elevation, is, the, extent, of, the, satellite, s, position, above, the, horizon, thus, a, satellite, at, the, horizon, has, zero, elevation, and, a, satellite, directly, overhead, has, elevation, of, 90, degrees, the, molniya, orbit, is, designed, so, that, the, satellite, spends, the, great, majority, of, its, time, over, the, far, northern, latitudes, during, which, its, ground, footprint, moves, only, slightly, its, period, is, one, half, day, so, that, the, satellite, is, available, for, operation, over, the, targeted, region, for, six, to, nine, hours, every, second, revolution, in, this, way, a, constellation, of, three, molniya, satellites, plus, in, orbit, spares, can, provide, uninterrupted, coverage, the, first, satellite, of, the, molniya, series, was, launched, on, 23, april, 1965, and, was, used, for, experimental, transmission, of, tv, signals, from, a, moscow, uplink, station, to, downlink, stations, located, in, siberia, and, the, russian, far, east, in, norilsk, khabarovsk, magadan, and, vladivostok, in, november, 1967, soviet, engineers, created, a, unique, system, of, national, tv, network, of, satellite, television, called, orbita, that, was, based, on, molniya, satellites, in, the, united, states, the, national, polar, orbiting, operational, environmental, satellite, system, npoess, was, established, in, 1994, to, consolidate, the, polar, satellite, operations, of, nasa, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, noaa, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, npoess, manages, a, number, of, satellites, for, various, purposes, for, example, metsat, for, meteorological, satellite, eumetsat, for, the, european, branch, of, the, program, and, metop, for, meteorological, operations, these, orbits, are, sun, synchronous, meaning, that, they, cross, the, equator, at, the, same, local, time, each, day, for, example, the, satellites, in, the, npoess, civilian, orbit, will, cross, the, equator, going, from, south, to, north, at, times, 1, 30, p, m, 5, 30, p, m, and, 9, 30, p, m, there, are, plans, and, initiatives, to, bring, dedicated, communications, satellite, beyond, geostationary, orbits, nasa, proposed, lunanet, as, a, data, network, aiming, to, provide, a, lunar, internet, for, cis, lunar, spacecraft, and, installations, the, moonlight, initiative, is, an, equivalent, esa, project, that, is, stated, to, be, compatible, and, providing, navigational, services, for, the, lunar, surface, both, programmes, are, satellite, constellstions, of, several, satellites, in, various, orbits, around, the, moon, other, orbits, are, also, planned, to, be, used, positions, in, the, earth, moon, libration, points, are, also, proposed, for, communication, satellites, covering, the, moon, alike, communication, satellites, in, geosynchronous, orbit, cover, the, earth, also, dedicated, communication, satellites, in, orbits, around, mars, supporting, different, missions, on, surface, and, other, orbits, are, considered, such, as, the, mars, telecommunications, orbiter, communications, satellites, are, usually, composed, of, the, following, subsystems, the, bandwidth, available, from, a, satellite, depends, upon, the, number, of, transponders, provided, by, the, satellite, each, service, tv, voice, internet, radio, requires, a, different, amount, of, bandwidth, for, transmission, this, is, typically, known, as, link, budgeting, and, a, network, simulator, can, be, used, to, arrive, at, the, exact, value, allocating, frequencies, to, satellite, services, is, a, complicated, process, which, requires, international, coordination, and, planning, this, is, carried, out, under, the, auspices, of, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, to, facilitate, frequency, planning, the, world, is, divided, into, three, regions, within, these, regions, frequency, bands, are, allocated, to, various, satellite, services, although, a, given, service, may, be, allocated, different, frequency, bands, in, different, regions, some, of, the, services, provided, by, satellites, are, the, first, and, historically, most, important, application, for, communication, satellites, was, in, intercontinental, long, distance, telephony, the, fixed, public, switched, telephone, network, relays, telephone, calls, from, land, line, telephones, to, an, earth, station, where, they, are, then, transmitted, to, a, geostationary, satellite, the, downlink, follows, an, analogous, path, improvements, in, submarine, communications, cables, through, the, use, of, fiber, optics, caused, some, decline, in, the, use, of, satellites, for, fixed, telephony, in, the, late, 20th, century, satellite, communications, are, still, used, in, many, applications, today, remote, islands, such, as, ascension, island, saint, helena, diego, garcia, and, easter, island, where, no, submarine, cables, are, in, service, need, satellite, telephones, there, are, also, regions, of, some, continents, and, countries, where, landline, telecommunications, are, rare, to, non, existent, for, example, large, regions, of, south, america, africa, canada, china, russia, and, australia, satellite, communications, also, provide, connection, to, the, edges, of, antarctica, and, greenland, other, land, use, for, satellite, phones, are, rigs, at, sea, a, backup, for, hospitals, military, and, recreation, ships, at, sea, as, well, as, planes, often, use, satellite, phones, satellite, phone, systems, can, be, accomplished, by, a, number, of, means, on, a, large, scale, often, there, will, be, a, local, telephone, system, in, an, isolated, area, with, a, link, to, the, telephone, system, in, a, main, land, area, there, are, also, services, that, will, patch, a, radio, signal, to, a, telephone, system, in, this, example, almost, any, type, of, satellite, can, be, used, satellite, phones, connect, directly, to, a, constellation, of, either, geostationary, or, low, earth, orbit, satellites, calls, are, then, forwarded, to, a, satellite, teleport, connected, to, the, public, switched, telephone, network, as, television, became, the, main, market, its, demand, for, simultaneous, delivery, of, relatively, few, signals, of, large, bandwidth, to, many, receivers, being, a, more, precise, match, for, the, capabilities, of, geosynchronous, comsats, two, satellite, types, are, used, for, north, american, television, and, radio, direct, broadcast, satellite, dbs, and, fixed, service, satellite, fss, the, definitions, of, fss, and, dbs, satellites, outside, of, north, america, especially, in, europe, are, a, bit, more, ambiguous, most, satellites, used, for, direct, to, home, television, in, europe, have, the, same, high, power, output, as, dbs, class, satellites, in, north, america, but, use, the, same, linear, polarization, as, fss, class, satellites, examples, of, these, are, the, astra, eutelsat, and, hotbird, spacecraft, in, orbit, over, the, european, continent, because, of, this, the, terms, fss, and, dbs, are, more, so, used, throughout, the, north, american, continent, and, are, uncommon, in, europe, fixed, service, satellites, use, the, c, band, and, the, lower, portions, of, the, k, u, band, they, are, normally, used, for, broadcast, feeds, to, and, from, television, networks, and, local, affiliate, stations, such, as, program, feeds, for, network, and, syndicated, programming, live, shots, and, backhauls, as, well, as, being, used, for, distance, learning, by, schools, and, universities, business, television, btv, videoconferencing, and, general, commercial, telecommunications, fss, satellites, are, also, used, to, distribute, national, cable, channels, to, cable, television, headends, free, to, air, satellite, tv, channels, are, also, usually, distributed, on, fss, satellites, in, the, k, u, band, the, intelsat, americas, 5, galaxy, 10r, and, amc, 3, satellites, over, north, america, provide, a, quite, large, amount, of, fta, channels, on, their, k, u, band, transponders, the, american, dish, network, dbs, service, has, also, recently, used, fss, technology, as, well, for, their, programming, packages, requiring, their, superdish, antenna, due, to, dish, network, needing, more, capacity, to, carry, local, television, stations, per, the, fcc, s, must, carry, regulations, and, for, more, bandwidth, to, carry, hdtv, channels, a, direct, broadcast, satellite, is, a, communications, satellite, that, transmits, to, small, dbs, satellite, dishes, usually, 18, to, 24, inches, or, 45, to, 60, cm, in, diameter, direct, broadcast, satellites, generally, operate, in, the, upper, portion, of, the, microwave, k, u, band, dbs, technology, is, used, for, dth, oriented, direct, to, home, satellite, tv, services, such, as, directv, dish, network, and, orby, tv, in, the, united, states, bell, satellite, tv, and, shaw, direct, in, canada, freesat, and, sky, in, the, uk, ireland, and, new, zealand, and, dstv, in, south, africa, operating, at, lower, frequency, and, lower, power, than, dbs, fss, satellites, require, a, much, larger, dish, for, reception, 3, to, 8, feet, 1, to, 2, 5, m, in, diameter, for, k, u, band, and, 12, feet, 3, 6, m, or, larger, for, c, band, they, use, linear, polarization, for, each, of, the, transponders, rf, input, and, output, as, opposed, to, circular, polarization, used, by, dbs, satellites, but, this, is, a, minor, technical, difference, that, users, do, not, notice, fss, satellite, technology, was, also, originally, used, for, dth, satellite, tv, from, the, late, 1970s, to, the, early, 1990s, in, the, united, states, in, the, form, of, tvro, television, receive, only, receivers, and, dishes, it, was, also, used, in, its, k, u, band, form, for, the, now, defunct, primestar, satellite, tv, service, some, satellites, have, been, launched, that, have, transponders, in, the, k, a, band, such, as, directv, s, spaceway, 1, satellite, and, anik, f2, nasa, and, isro, have, also, launched, experimental, satellites, carrying, k, a, band, beacons, recently, some, manufacturers, have, also, introduced, special, antennas, for, mobile, reception, of, dbs, television, using, global, positioning, system, gps, technology, as, a, reference, these, antennas, automatically, re, aim, to, the, satellite, no, matter, where, or, how, the, vehicle, on, which, the, antenna, is, mounted, is, situated, these, mobile, satellite, antennas, are, popular, with, some, recreational, vehicle, owners, such, mobile, dbs, antennas, are, also, used, by, jetblue, airways, for, directv, supplied, by, livetv, a, subsidiary, of, jetblue, which, passengers, can, view, on, board, on, lcd, screens, mounted, in, the, seats, satellite, radio, offers, audio, broadcast, services, in, some, countries, notably, the, united, states, mobile, services, allow, listeners, to, roam, a, continent, listening, to, the, same, audio, programming, anywhere, a, satellite, radio, or, subscription, radio, sr, is, a, digital, radio, signal, that, is, broadcast, by, a, communications, satellite, which, covers, a, much, wider, geographical, range, than, terrestrial, radio, signals, amateur, radio, operators, have, access, to, amateur, satellites, which, have, been, designed, specifically, to, carry, amateur, radio, traffic, most, such, satellites, operate, as, spaceborne, repeaters, and, are, generally, accessed, by, amateurs, equipped, with, uhf, or, vhf, radio, equipment, and, highly, directional, antennas, such, as, yagis, or, dish, antennas, due, to, launch, costs, most, current, amateur, satellites, are, launched, into, fairly, low, earth, orbits, and, are, designed, to, deal, with, only, a, limited, number, of, brief, contacts, at, any, given, time, some, satellites, also, provide, data, forwarding, services, using, the, x, 25, or, similar, protocols, after, the, 1990s, satellite, communication, technology, has, been, used, as, a, means, to, connect, to, the, internet, via, broadband, data, connections, this, can, be, very, useful, for, users, who, are, located, in, remote, areas, and, cannot, access, a, broadband, connection, or, require, high, availability, of, services, communications, satellites, are, used, for, military, communications, applications, such, as, global, command, and, control, systems, examples, of, military, systems, that, use, communication, satellites, are, the, milstar, the, dscs, and, the, fltsatcom, of, the, united, states, nato, satellites, united, kingdom, satellites, for, instance, skynet, and, satellites, of, the, former, soviet, union, india, has, launched, its, first, military, communication, satellite, gsat, 7, its, transponders, operate, in, uhf, f, c, and, k, u, band, bands, typically, military, satellites, operate, in, the, uhf, shf, also, known, as, x, band, or, ehf, also, known, as, k, a, band, frequency, bands, near, ground, in, situ, environmental, monitoring, equipment, such, as, tide, gauges, weather, stations, weather, buoys, and, radiosondes, may, use, satellites, for, one, way, data, transmission, or, two, way, telemetry, and, telecontrol, it, may, be, based, on, a, secondary, payload, of, a, weather, satellite, as, in, the, case, of, goes, and, meteosat, and, others, in, the, argos, system, or, in, dedicated, satellites, such, as, scd, the, data, rate, is, typically, much, lower, than, in, satellite, internet, access
