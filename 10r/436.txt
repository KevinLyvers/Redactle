a, cathode, ray, tube, crt, is, a, vacuum, tube, containing, one, or, more, electron, guns, which, emit, electron, beams, that, are, manipulated, to, display, images, on, a, phosphorescent, screen, the, images, may, represent, electrical, waveforms, on, an, oscilloscope, a, frame, of, video, on, an, analog, television, set, tv, digital, raster, graphics, on, a, computer, monitor, or, other, phenomena, like, radar, targets, a, crt, in, a, tv, is, commonly, called, a, picture, tube, crts, have, also, been, used, as, memory, devices, in, which, case, the, screen, is, not, intended, to, be, visible, to, an, observer, the, term, cathode, ray, was, used, to, describe, electron, beams, when, they, were, first, discovered, before, it, was, understood, that, what, was, emitted, from, the, cathode, was, a, beam, of, electrons, in, crt, tvs, and, computer, monitors, the, entire, front, area, of, the, tube, is, scanned, repeatedly, and, systematically, in, a, fixed, pattern, called, a, raster, in, color, devices, an, image, is, produced, by, controlling, the, intensity, of, each, of, three, electron, beams, one, for, each, additive, primary, color, red, green, and, blue, with, a, video, signal, as, a, reference, in, modern, crt, monitors, and, tvs, the, beams, are, bent, by, magnetic, deflection, using, a, deflection, yoke, electrostatic, deflection, is, commonly, used, in, oscilloscopes, the, tube, is, a, glass, envelope, which, is, heavy, fragile, and, long, from, front, screen, face, to, rear, end, its, interior, must, be, close, to, a, vacuum, to, prevent, the, emitted, electrons, from, colliding, with, air, molecules, and, scattering, before, they, hit, the, tube, s, face, thus, the, interior, is, evacuated, to, less, than, a, millionth, of, atmospheric, pressure, as, such, handling, a, crt, carries, the, risk, of, violent, implosion, that, can, hurl, glass, at, great, velocity, the, face, is, typically, made, of, thick, lead, glass, or, special, barium, strontium, glass, to, be, shatter, resistant, and, to, block, most, x, ray, emissions, this, tube, makes, up, most, of, the, weight, of, crt, tvs, and, computer, monitors, since, the, early, 2010s, crts, have, been, superseded, by, flat, panel, display, technologies, such, as, lcd, plasma, display, and, oled, displays, which, are, cheaper, to, manufacture, and, run, as, well, as, significantly, lighter, and, thinner, flat, panel, displays, can, also, be, made, in, very, large, sizes, whereas, 40, 45, inches, 100, 110, cm, was, about, the, largest, size, of, a, crt, a, crt, works, by, electrically, heating, a, tungsten, coil, which, in, turn, heats, a, cathode, in, the, rear, of, the, crt, causing, it, to, emit, electrons, which, are, modulated, and, focused, by, electrodes, the, electrons, are, steered, by, deflection, coils, or, plates, and, an, anode, accelerates, them, towards, the, phosphor, coated, screen, which, generates, light, when, hit, by, the, electrons, cathode, rays, were, discovered, by, julius, pl, cker, and, johann, wilhelm, hittorf, hittorf, observed, that, some, unknown, rays, were, emitted, from, the, cathode, negative, electrode, which, could, cast, shadows, on, the, glowing, wall, of, the, tube, indicating, the, rays, were, travelling, in, straight, lines, in, 1890, arthur, schuster, demonstrated, cathode, rays, could, be, deflected, by, electric, fields, and, william, crookes, showed, they, could, be, deflected, by, magnetic, fields, in, 1897, j, j, thomson, succeeded, in, measuring, the, mass, to, charge, ratio, of, cathode, rays, showing, that, they, consisted, of, negatively, charged, particles, smaller, than, atoms, the, first, subatomic, particles, which, had, already, been, named, electrons, by, irish, physicist, george, johnstone, stoney, in, 1891, the, earliest, version, of, the, crt, was, known, as, the, braun, tube, invented, by, the, german, physicist, ferdinand, braun, in, 1897, it, was, a, cold, cathode, diode, a, modification, of, the, crookes, tube, with, a, phosphor, coated, screen, braun, was, the, first, to, conceive, the, use, of, a, crt, as, a, display, device, the, braun, tube, became, the, foundation, of, 20th, century, tv, in, 1908, alan, archibald, campbell, swinton, fellow, of, the, royal, society, uk, published, a, letter, in, the, scientific, journal, nature, in, which, he, described, how, distant, electric, vision, could, be, achieved, by, using, a, cathode, ray, tube, or, braun, tube, as, both, a, transmitting, and, receiving, device, he, expanded, on, his, vision, in, a, speech, given, in, london, in, 1911, and, reported, in, the, times, and, the, journal, of, the, r, ntgen, society, the, first, cathode, ray, tube, to, use, a, hot, cathode, was, developed, by, john, bertrand, johnson, who, gave, his, name, to, the, term, johnson, noise, and, harry, weiner, weinhart, of, western, electric, and, became, a, commercial, product, in, 1922, the, introduction, of, hot, cathodes, allowed, for, lower, acceleration, anode, voltages, and, higher, electron, beam, currents, since, the, anode, now, only, accelerated, the, electrons, emitted, by, the, hot, cathode, and, no, longer, had, to, have, a, very, high, voltage, to, induce, electron, emission, from, the, cold, cathode, in, 1926, kenjiro, takayanagi, demonstrated, a, crt, tv, receiver, with, a, mechanical, video, camera, that, received, images, with, a, 40, line, resolution, by, 1927, he, improved, the, resolution, to, 100, lines, which, was, unrivaled, until, 1931, by, 1928, he, was, the, first, to, transmit, human, faces, in, half, tones, on, a, crt, display, in, 1927, philo, farnsworth, created, a, tv, prototype, the, crt, was, named, in, 1929, by, inventor, vladimir, k, zworykin, 84, he, was, subsequently, hired, by, rca, which, was, granted, a, trademark, for, the, term, kinescope, rca, s, term, for, a, crt, in, 1932, it, voluntarily, released, the, term, to, the, public, domain, in, 1950, in, the, 1930s, allen, b, dumont, made, the, first, crts, to, last, 1, 000, hours, of, use, which, was, one, of, the, factors, that, led, to, the, widespread, adoption, of, tv, the, first, commercially, made, electronic, tv, sets, with, cathode, ray, tubes, were, manufactured, by, telefunken, in, germany, in, 1934, in, 1947, the, cathode, ray, tube, amusement, device, the, earliest, known, interactive, electronic, game, as, well, as, the, first, to, incorporate, a, cathode, ray, tube, screen, was, created, from, 1949, to, the, early, 1960s, there, was, a, shift, from, circular, crts, to, rectangular, crts, although, the, first, rectangular, crts, were, made, in, 1938, by, telefunken, while, circular, crts, were, the, norm, european, tv, sets, often, blocked, portions, of, the, screen, to, make, it, appear, somewhat, rectangular, while, american, sets, often, left, the, entire, front, of, the, crt, exposed, or, only, blocked, the, upper, and, lower, portions, of, the, crt, in, 1954, rca, produced, some, of, the, first, color, crts, the, 15gp22, crts, used, in, the, ct, 100, the, first, color, tv, set, to, be, mass, produced, the, first, rectangular, color, crts, were, also, made, in, 1954, however, the, first, rectangular, color, crts, to, be, offered, to, the, public, were, made, in, 1963, one, of, the, challenges, that, had, to, be, solved, to, produce, the, rectangular, color, crt, was, convergence, at, the, corners, of, the, crt, in, 1965, brighter, rare, earth, phosphors, began, replacing, dimmer, and, cadmium, containing, red, and, green, phosphors, eventually, blue, phosphors, were, replaced, as, well, the, size, of, crts, increased, over, time, from, 20, inches, in, 1938, to, 21, inches, in, 1955, 25, inches, by, 1974, 30, inches, by, 1980, 35, inches, by, 1985, and, 43, inches, by, 1989, however, experimental, 31, inch, crts, were, made, as, far, back, as, 1938, in, 1960, the, aiken, tube, was, invented, it, was, a, crt, in, a, flat, panel, display, format, with, a, single, electron, gun, deflection, was, electrostatic, and, magnetic, but, due, to, patent, problems, it, was, never, put, into, production, it, was, also, envisioned, as, a, head, up, display, in, aircraft, by, the, time, patent, issues, were, solved, rca, had, already, invested, heavily, in, conventional, crts, 1968, marked, the, release, of, sony, trinitron, brand, with, the, model, kv, 1310, which, was, based, on, aperture, grille, technology, it, was, acclaimed, to, have, improved, the, output, brightness, the, trinitron, screen, was, identical, with, its, upright, cylindrical, shape, due, to, its, unique, triple, cathode, single, gun, construction, in, 1987, flat, screen, crts, were, developed, by, zenith, for, computer, monitors, reducing, reflections, and, helping, increase, image, contrast, and, brightness, such, crts, were, expensive, which, limited, their, use, to, computer, monitors, attempts, were, made, to, produce, flat, screen, crts, using, inexpensive, and, widely, available, float, glass, in, 1990, the, first, crt, with, hd, resolution, the, sony, kw, 3600hd, was, released, to, the, market, it, is, considered, to, be, historical, material, by, japan, s, national, museum, the, sony, kwp, 5500hd, an, hd, crt, projection, tv, was, released, in, 1992, in, the, mid, 1990s, some, 160, million, crts, were, made, per, year, in, the, mid, 2000s, canon, and, sony, presented, the, surface, conduction, electron, emitter, display, and, field, emission, displays, respectively, they, both, were, flat, panel, displays, that, had, one, sed, or, several, fed, electron, emitters, per, subpixel, in, place, of, electron, guns, the, electron, emitters, were, placed, on, a, sheet, of, glass, and, the, electrons, were, accelerated, to, a, nearby, sheet, of, glass, with, phosphors, using, an, anode, voltage, the, electrons, were, not, focused, making, each, subpixel, essentially, a, flood, beam, crt, they, were, never, put, into, mass, production, as, lcd, technology, was, significantly, cheaper, eliminating, the, market, for, such, displays, the, last, large, scale, manufacturer, of, in, this, case, recycled, crts, videocon, ceased, in, 2015, crt, tvs, stopped, being, made, around, the, same, time, in, 2012, samsung, sdi, and, several, other, major, companies, were, fined, by, the, european, commission, for, price, fixing, of, tv, cathode, ray, tubes, the, same, occurred, in, 2015, in, the, us, and, in, canada, in, 2018, worldwide, sales, of, crt, computer, monitors, peaked, in, 2000, at, 90, million, units, while, those, of, crt, tvs, peaked, in, 2005, at, 130, million, units, beginning, in, the, late, 1990s, to, the, early, 2000s, crts, began, to, be, replaced, with, lcds, starting, first, with, computer, monitors, smaller, than, 15, inches, in, size, largely, because, of, their, lower, bulk, among, the, first, manufacturers, to, stop, crt, production, was, hitachi, in, 2001, followed, by, sony, in, japan, in, 2004, flat, panel, displays, dropped, in, price, and, started, significantly, displacing, cathode, ray, tubes, in, the, 2000s, lcd, monitor, sales, began, exceeding, those, of, crts, in, 2003, 2004, and, lcd, tv, sales, started, exceeding, those, of, crts, in, some, markets, in, 2005, samsung, sdi, stopped, crt, production, in, 2012, despite, being, a, mainstay, of, display, technology, for, decades, crt, based, computer, monitors, and, tvs, are, now, obsolete, demand, for, crt, screens, dropped, in, the, late, 2000s, despite, efforts, from, samsung, and, lg, to, make, crts, competitive, with, their, lcd, and, plasma, counterparts, offering, slimmer, and, cheaper, models, to, compete, with, similarly, sized, and, more, expensive, lcds, crts, eventually, became, obsolete, and, were, relegated, to, developing, markets, and, vintage, enthusiasts, once, lcds, fell, in, price, with, their, lower, bulk, weight, and, ability, to, be, wall, mounted, coming, as, pluses, some, industries, still, use, crts, because, it, is, either, too, much, effort, downtime, and, or, cost, to, replace, them, or, there, is, no, substitute, available, a, notable, example, is, the, airline, industry, planes, such, as, the, boeing, 747, 400, and, the, airbus, a320, used, crt, instruments, in, their, glass, cockpits, instead, of, mechanical, instruments, airlines, such, as, lufthansa, still, use, crt, technology, which, also, uses, floppy, disks, for, navigation, updates, they, are, also, used, in, some, military, equipment, for, similar, reasons, as, of, 2022, at, least, one, company, manufactures, new, crts, for, these, markets, a, popular, consumer, usage, of, crts, is, for, retrogaming, some, games, are, impossible, to, play, without, crt, display, hardware, light, guns, only, work, on, crts, because, they, depend, on, the, progressive, timing, properties, of, crts, another, reason, people, use, crts, due, to, the, natural, blending, of, these, displays, some, games, designed, for, crt, displays, exploit, this, which, allows, them, to, look, more, aesthetically, pleasing, on, these, displays, the, body, of, a, crt, is, usually, made, up, of, three, parts, a, screen, faceplate, panel, a, cone, funnel, and, a, neck, the, joined, screen, funnel, and, neck, are, known, as, the, bulb, or, envelope, the, neck, is, made, from, a, glass, tube, while, the, funnel, and, screen, are, made, by, pouring, and, then, pressing, glass, into, a, mold, the, glass, known, as, crt, glass, or, tv, glass, needs, special, properties, to, shield, against, x, rays, while, providing, adequate, light, transmission, in, the, screen, or, being, very, electrically, insulating, in, the, funnel, and, neck, the, formulation, that, gives, the, glass, its, properties, is, also, known, as, the, melt, the, glass, is, of, very, high, quality, being, almost, contaminant, and, defect, free, most, of, the, costs, associated, with, glass, production, come, from, the, energy, used, to, melt, the, raw, materials, into, glass, glass, furnaces, for, crt, glass, production, have, several, taps, to, allow, molds, to, be, replaced, without, stopping, the, furnace, to, allow, production, of, crts, of, several, sizes, only, the, glass, used, on, the, screen, needs, to, have, precise, optical, properties, the, optical, properties, of, the, glass, used, on, the, screen, affect, color, reproduction, and, purity, in, color, crts, transmittance, or, how, transparent, the, glass, is, may, be, adjusted, to, be, more, transparent, to, certain, colors, wavelengths, of, light, transmittance, is, measured, at, the, center, of, the, screen, with, a, 546, nm, wavelength, light, and, a, 10, 16mm, thick, screen, transmittance, goes, down, with, increasing, thickness, standard, transmittances, for, color, crt, screens, are, 86, 73, 57, 46, 42, and, 30, lower, transmittances, are, used, to, improve, image, contrast, but, they, put, more, stress, on, the, electron, gun, requiring, more, power, on, the, electron, gun, for, a, higher, electron, beam, power, to, light, the, phosphors, more, brightly, to, compensate, for, the, reduced, transmittance, the, transmittance, must, be, uniform, across, the, screen, to, ensure, color, purity, the, radius, curvature, of, screens, has, increased, grown, less, curved, over, time, from, 30, to, 68, inches, ultimately, evolving, into, completely, flat, screens, reducing, reflections, the, thickness, of, both, curved, and, flat, screens, gradually, increases, from, the, center, outwards, and, with, it, transmittance, is, gradually, reduced, this, means, that, flat, screen, crts, may, not, be, completely, flat, on, the, inside, the, glass, used, in, crts, arrives, from, the, glass, factory, to, the, crt, factory, as, either, separate, screens, and, funnels, with, fused, necks, for, color, crts, or, as, bulbs, made, up, of, a, fused, screen, funnel, and, neck, there, were, several, glass, formulations, for, different, types, of, crts, that, were, classified, using, codes, specific, to, each, glass, manufacturer, the, compositions, of, the, melts, were, also, specific, to, each, manufacturer, those, optimized, for, high, color, purity, and, contrast, were, doped, with, neodymium, while, those, for, monochrome, crts, were, tinted, to, differing, levels, depending, on, the, formulation, used, and, had, transmittances, of, 42, or, 30, purity, is, ensuring, that, the, correct, colors, are, activated, for, example, ensuring, that, red, is, displayed, uniformly, across, the, screen, while, convergence, ensures, that, images, are, not, distorted, convergence, may, be, modified, using, a, cross, hatch, pattern, crt, glass, used, to, be, made, by, dedicated, companies, such, as, agc, inc, o, i, glass, samsung, corning, precision, materials, corning, inc, and, nippon, electric, glass, others, such, as, videocon, sony, for, the, us, market, and, thomson, made, their, own, glass, the, funnel, and, the, neck, are, made, of, leaded, potash, soda, glass, or, lead, silicate, glass, formulation, to, shield, against, x, rays, generated, by, high, voltage, electrons, as, they, decelerate, after, striking, a, target, such, as, the, phosphor, screen, or, shadow, mask, of, a, color, crt, the, velocity, of, the, electrons, depends, on, the, anode, voltage, of, the, crt, the, higher, the, voltage, the, higher, the, speed, the, amount, of, x, rays, emitted, by, a, crt, can, also, lowered, by, reducing, the, brightness, of, the, image, leaded, glass, is, used, because, it, is, inexpensive, while, also, shielding, heavily, against, x, rays, although, some, funnels, may, also, contain, barium, the, screen, is, usually, instead, made, out, of, a, special, lead, free, silicate, glass, formulation, with, barium, and, strontium, to, shield, against, x, rays, as, it, doesn, t, brown, unlike, glass, containing, lead, another, glass, formulation, uses, 2, 3, of, lead, on, the, screen, alternatively, zirconium, can, also, be, used, on, the, screen, in, combination, with, barium, instead, of, lead, monochrome, crts, may, have, a, tinted, barium, lead, glass, formulation, in, both, the, screen, and, funnel, with, a, potash, soda, lead, glass, in, the, neck, the, potash, soda, and, barium, lead, formulations, have, different, thermal, expansion, coefficients, the, glass, used, in, the, neck, must, be, an, excellent, electrical, insulator, to, contain, the, voltages, used, in, the, electron, optics, of, the, electron, gun, such, as, focusing, lenses, the, lead, in, the, glass, causes, it, to, brown, darken, with, use, due, to, x, rays, usually, the, crt, cathode, wears, out, due, to, cathode, poisoning, before, browning, becomes, apparent, the, glass, formulation, determines, the, highest, possible, anode, voltage, and, hence, the, maximum, possible, crt, screen, size, for, color, maximum, voltages, are, often, 24, 32, kv, while, for, monochrome, it, is, usually, 21, or, 24, 5, kv, limiting, the, size, of, monochrome, crts, to, 21, inches, or, 1, kv, per, inch, the, voltage, needed, depends, on, the, size, and, type, of, crt, since, the, formulations, are, different, they, must, be, compatible, with, one, another, having, similar, thermal, expansion, coefficients, the, screen, may, also, have, an, anti, glare, or, anti, reflective, coating, or, be, ground, to, prevent, reflections, crts, may, also, have, an, anti, static, coating, the, leaded, glass, in, the, funnels, of, crts, may, contain, 21, 25, of, lead, oxide, pbo, the, neck, may, contain, 30, 40, of, lead, oxide, and, the, screen, may, contain, 12, of, barium, oxide, and, 12, of, strontium, oxide, a, typical, crt, contains, several, kilograms, of, lead, as, lead, oxide, in, the, glass, depending, on, its, size, 12, inch, crts, contain, 0, 5, kg, of, lead, in, total, while, 32, inch, crts, contain, up, to, 3, kg, strontium, oxide, began, being, used, in, crts, its, major, application, in, the, 1970s, before, this, crts, used, lead, on, the, faceplate, some, early, crts, used, a, metal, funnel, insulated, with, polyethylene, instead, of, glass, with, conductive, material, others, had, ceramic, or, blown, pyrex, instead, of, pressed, glass, funnels, early, crts, did, not, have, a, dedicated, anode, cap, connection, the, funnel, was, the, anode, connection, so, it, was, live, during, operation, the, funnel, is, coated, on, the, inside, and, outside, with, a, conductive, coating, making, the, funnel, a, capacitor, helping, stabilize, and, filter, the, anode, voltage, of, the, crt, and, significantly, reducing, the, amount, of, time, needed, to, turn, on, a, crt, the, stability, provided, by, the, coating, solved, problems, inherent, to, early, power, supply, designs, as, they, used, vacuum, tubes, because, the, funnel, is, used, as, a, capacitor, the, glass, used, in, the, funnel, must, be, an, excellent, electrical, insulator, dielectric, the, inner, coating, has, a, positive, voltage, the, anode, voltage, that, can, be, several, kv, while, the, outer, coating, is, connected, to, ground, crts, powered, by, more, modern, power, supplies, do, not, need, to, be, connected, to, ground, due, to, the, more, robust, design, of, modern, power, supplies, the, value, of, the, capacitor, formed, by, the, funnel, is, 5, 10, nf, although, at, the, voltage, the, anode, is, normally, supplied, with, the, capacitor, formed, by, the, funnel, can, also, suffer, from, dielectric, absorption, similarly, to, other, types, of, capacitors, because, of, this, crts, have, to, be, discharged, before, handling, to, prevent, injury, the, depth, of, a, crt, is, related, to, its, screen, size, usual, deflection, angles, were, 90, for, computer, monitor, crts, and, small, crts, and, 110, which, was, the, standard, in, larger, tv, crts, with, 120, or, 125, being, used, in, slim, crts, made, since, 2001, 2005, in, an, attempt, to, compete, with, lcd, tvs, over, time, deflection, angles, increased, as, they, became, practical, from, 50, in, 1938, to, 110, in, 1959, and, 125, in, the, 2000s, 140, deflection, crts, were, researched, but, never, commercialized, as, convergence, problems, were, never, resolved, the, size, of, a, crt, can, be, measured, by, the, screen, s, entire, area, or, face, diagonal, or, alternatively, by, only, its, viewable, area, or, diagonal, that, is, coated, by, phosphor, and, surrounded, by, black, edges, while, the, viewable, area, may, be, rectangular, the, edges, of, the, crt, may, have, a, curvature, e, g, black, stripe, crts, first, made, by, toshiba, in, 1972, or, the, edges, may, be, black, and, truly, flat, e, g, flatron, crts, or, the, viewable, area, may, follow, the, curvature, of, the, edges, of, the, crt, with, or, without, black, edges, or, curved, edges, small, crts, below, 3, inches, were, made, for, handheld, tvs, such, as, the, mtv, 1, and, viewfinders, in, camcorders, in, these, there, may, be, no, black, edges, that, are, however, truly, flat, most, of, the, weight, of, a, crt, comes, from, the, thick, glass, screen, which, comprises, 65, of, the, total, weight, of, a, crt, and, limits, its, practical, size, see, size, the, funnel, and, neck, glass, comprise, the, remaining, 30, and, 5, respectively, the, glass, in, the, funnel, can, vary, in, thickness, to, join, the, thin, neck, with, the, thick, screen, chemically, or, thermally, tempered, glass, may, be, used, to, reduce, the, weight, of, the, crt, glass, the, outer, conductive, coating, is, connected, to, ground, while, the, inner, conductive, coating, is, connected, using, the, anode, button, cap, through, a, series, of, capacitors, and, diodes, a, cockcroft, walton, generator, to, the, high, voltage, flyback, transformer, the, inner, coating, is, the, anode, of, the, crt, which, together, with, an, electrode, in, the, electron, gun, is, also, known, as, the, final, anode, the, inner, coating, is, connected, to, the, electrode, using, springs, the, electrode, forms, part, of, a, bipotential, lens, the, capacitors, and, diodes, serve, as, a,

oxide, on, the, inside, on, the, outside, most, crts, but, not, all, use, aquadag, aquadag, is, an, electrically, conductive, graphite, based, paint, in, color, crts, the, aquadag, is, sprayed, onto, the, interior, of, the, funnel, whereas, historically, aquadag, was, painted, into, the, interior, of, monochrome, crts, the, anode, is, used, to, accelerate, the, electrons, towards, the, screen, and, also, collects, the, secondary, electrons, that, are, emitted, by, the, phosphor, particles, in, the, vacuum, of, the, crt, the, anode, cap, connection, in, modern, crts, must, be, able, to, handle, up, to, 55, 60kv, depending, on, the, size, and, brightness, of, the, crt, higher, voltages, allow, for, larger, crts, higher, image, brightness, or, a, tradeoff, between, the, two, it, consists, of, a, metal, clip, that, expands, on, the, inside, of, an, anode, button, that, is, embedded, on, the, funnel, glass, of, the, crt, the, connection, is, insulated, by, a, silicone, suction, cup, possibly, also, using, silicone, grease, to, prevent, corona, discharge, the, anode, button, must, be, specially, shaped, to, establish, a, hermetic, seal, between, the, button, and, funnel, x, rays, may, leak, through, the, anode, button, although, that, may, not, be, the, case, in, newer, crts, starting, from, the, late, 1970s, to, early, 1980s, thanks, to, a, new, button, and, clip, design, the, button, may, consist, of, a, set, of, 3, nested, cups, with, the, outermost, cup, being, made, of, a, nickel, chromium, iron, alloy, containing, 40, 49, of, nickel, and, 3, 6, of, chromium, to, make, the, button, easy, to, fuse, to, the, funnel, glass, with, a, first, inner, cup, made, of, thick, inexpensive, iron, to, shield, against, x, rays, and, with, the, second, innermost, cup, also, being, made, of, iron, or, any, other, electrically, conductive, metal, to, connect, to, the, clip, the, cups, must, be, heat, resistant, enough, and, have, similar, thermal, expansion, coefficients, similar, to, that, of, the, funnel, glass, to, withstand, being, fused, to, the, funnel, glass, the, inner, side, of, the, button, is, connected, to, the, inner, conductive, coating, of, the, crt, the, anode, button, may, be, attached, to, the, funnel, while, its, being, pressed, into, shape, in, a, mold, alternatively, the, x, ray, shielding, may, instead, be, built, into, the, clip, the, flyback, transformer, is, also, known, as, an, ihvt, integrated, high, voltage, transformer, if, it, includes, a, voltage, multiplier, the, flyback, uses, a, ceramic, or, powdered, iron, core, to, enable, efficient, operation, at, high, frequencies, the, flyback, contains, one, primary, and, many, secondary, windings, that, provide, several, different, voltages, the, main, secondary, winding, supplies, the, voltage, multiplier, with, voltage, pulses, to, ultimately, supply, the, crt, with, the, high, anode, voltage, it, uses, while, the, remaining, windings, supply, the, crt, s, filament, voltage, keying, pulses, focus, voltage, and, voltages, derived, from, the, scan, raster, when, the, transformer, is, turned, off, the, flyback, s, magnetic, field, quickly, collapses, which, induces, high, voltage, in, its, windings, the, speed, at, which, the, magnetic, field, collapses, determines, the, voltage, that, is, induced, so, the, voltage, increases, alongside, its, speed, a, capacitor, retrace, timing, capacitor, or, series, of, capacitors, to, provide, redundancy, is, used, to, slow, the, collapse, of, the, magnetic, field, the, design, of, the, high, voltage, power, supply, in, a, product, using, a, crt, has, an, influence, in, the, amount, of, x, rays, emitted, by, the, crt, the, amount, of, emitted, x, rays, increases, with, both, higher, voltages, and, currents, if, the, product, such, as, a, tv, set, uses, an, unregulated, high, voltage, power, supply, meaning, that, anode, and, focus, voltage, go, down, with, increasing, electron, current, when, displaying, a, bright, image, the, amount, of, emitted, x, rays, is, as, its, highest, when, the, crt, is, displaying, a, moderately, bright, images, since, when, displaying, dark, or, bright, images, the, higher, anode, voltage, counteracts, the, lower, electron, beam, current, and, vice, versa, respectively, the, high, voltage, regulator, and, rectifier, vacuum, tubes, in, some, old, crt, tv, sets, may, also, emit, x, rays, the, electron, gun, emits, the, electrons, that, ultimately, hit, the, phosphors, on, the, screen, of, the, crt, the, electron, gun, contains, a, heater, which, heats, a, cathode, which, generates, electrons, that, using, grids, are, focused, and, ultimately, accelerated, into, the, screen, of, the, crt, the, acceleration, occurs, in, conjunction, with, the, inner, aluminum, or, aquadag, coating, of, the, crt, the, electron, gun, is, positioned, so, that, it, aims, at, the, center, of, the, screen, it, is, inside, the, neck, of, the, crt, and, it, is, held, together, and, mounted, to, the, neck, using, glass, beads, or, glass, support, rods, which, are, the, glass, strips, on, the, electron, gun, the, electron, gun, is, made, separately, and, then, placed, inside, the, neck, through, a, process, called, winding, or, sealing, the, electron, gun, has, a, glass, wafer, that, is, fused, to, the, neck, of, the, crt, the, connections, to, the, electron, gun, penetrate, the, glass, wafer, once, the, electron, gun, is, inside, the, neck, its, metal, parts, grids, are, arced, between, each, other, using, high, voltage, to, smooth, any, rough, edges, in, a, process, called, spot, knocking, to, prevent, the, rough, edges, in, the, grids, from, generating, secondary, electrons, the, electron, gun, has, an, indirectly, heated, hot, cathode, that, is, heated, by, a, tungsten, filament, heating, element, the, heater, may, draw, 0, 5, 2, a, of, current, depending, on, the, crt, the, voltage, applied, to, the, heater, can, affect, the, life, of, the, crt, heating, the, cathode, energizes, the, electrons, in, it, aiding, electron, emission, while, at, the, same, time, current, is, supplied, to, the, cathode, typically, anywhere, from, 140, ma, at, 1, 5, v, to, 600, ma, at, 6, 3, v, the, cathode, creates, an, electron, cloud, emits, electrons, whose, electrons, are, extracted, accelerated, and, focused, into, an, electron, beam, color, crts, have, three, cathodes, one, for, red, green, and, blue, the, heater, sits, inside, the, cathode, but, does, not, touch, it, the, cathode, has, its, own, separate, electrical, connection, the, cathode, is, a, material, coated, onto, a, piece, of, nickel, which, provides, the, electrical, connection, and, structural, support, the, heater, sits, inside, this, piece, without, touching, it, there, are, several, short, circuits, that, can, occur, in, a, crt, electron, gun, one, is, a, heater, to, cathode, short, that, causes, the, cathode, to, permanently, emit, electrons, which, may, cause, an, image, with, a, bright, red, green, or, blue, tint, with, retrace, lines, depending, on, the, cathode, s, affected, alternatively, the, cathode, may, short, to, the, control, grid, possibly, causing, similar, effects, or, the, control, grid, and, screen, grid, g2, can, short, causing, a, very, dark, image, or, no, image, at, all, the, cathode, may, be, surrounded, by, a, shield, to, prevent, sputtering, the, cathode, is, a, layer, of, barium, oxide, which, is, coated, on, a, piece, of, nickel, for, electrical, and, mechanical, support, the, barium, oxide, must, be, activated, by, heating, to, enable, it, to, release, electrons, activation, is, necessary, because, barium, oxide, is, not, stable, in, air, so, it, is, applied, to, the, cathode, as, barium, carbonate, which, cannot, emit, electrons, activation, heats, the, barium, carbonate, to, decompose, it, into, barium, oxide, and, carbon, dioxide, while, forming, a, thin, layer, of, metallic, barium, on, the, cathode, activation, is, done, when, forming, the, vacuum, described, in, evacuation, after, activation, the, oxide, can, become, damaged, by, several, common, gases, such, as, water, vapor, carbon, dioxide, and, oxygen, alternatively, barium, strontium, calcium, carbonate, may, be, used, instead, of, barium, carbonate, yielding, barium, strontium, and, calcium, oxides, after, activation, during, operation, the, barium, oxide, is, heated, to, 800, 1000, c, at, which, point, it, starts, shedding, electrons, since, it, is, a, hot, cathode, it, is, prone, to, cathode, poisoning, which, is, the, formation, of, a, positive, ion, layer, that, prevents, the, cathode, from, emitting, electrons, reducing, image, brightness, significantly, or, completely, and, causing, focus, and, intensity, to, be, affected, by, the, frequency, of, the, video, signal, preventing, detailed, images, from, being, displayed, by, the, crt, the, positive, ions, come, from, leftover, air, molecules, inside, the, crt, or, from, the, cathode, itself, that, react, over, time, with, the, surface, of, the, hot, cathode, reducing, metals, such, as, manganese, zirconium, magnesium, aluminum, or, titanium, may, be, added, to, the, piece, of, nickel, to, lengthen, the, life, of, the, cathode, as, during, activation, the, reducing, metals, diffuse, into, the, barium, oxide, improving, its, lifespan, especially, at, high, electron, beam, currents, in, color, crts, with, red, green, and, blue, cathodes, one, or, more, cathodes, may, be, affected, independently, of, the, others, causing, total, or, partial, loss, of, one, or, more, colors, crts, can, wear, or, burn, out, due, to, cathode, poisoning, cathode, poisoning, is, accelerated, by, increased, cathode, current, overdriving, in, color, crts, since, there, are, three, cathodes, one, for, red, green, and, blue, a, single, or, more, poisoned, cathode, may, cause, the, partial, or, complete, loss, of, one, or, more, colors, tinting, the, image, the, layer, may, also, act, as, a, capacitor, in, series, with, the, cathode, inducing, thermal, lag, the, cathode, may, instead, be, made, of, scandium, oxide, or, incorporate, it, as, a, dopant, to, delay, cathode, poisoning, extending, the, life, of, the, cathode, by, up, to, 15, the, amount, of, electrons, generated, by, the, cathodes, is, related, to, their, surface, area, a, cathode, with, more, surface, area, creates, more, electrons, in, a, larger, electron, cloud, which, makes, focusing, the, electron, cloud, into, an, electron, beam, more, difficult, normally, only, a, part, of, the, cathode, emits, electrons, unless, the, crt, displays, images, with, parts, that, are, at, full, image, brightness, only, the, parts, at, full, brightness, cause, all, of, the, cathode, to, emit, electrons, the, area, of, the, cathode, that, emits, electrons, grows, from, the, center, outwards, as, brightness, increases, so, cathode, wear, may, be, uneven, when, only, the, center, of, the, cathode, is, worn, the, crt, may, light, brightly, those, parts, of, images, that, have, full, image, brightness, but, not, show, darker, parts, of, images, at, all, in, such, a, case, the, crt, displays, a, poor, gamma, characteristic, a, negative, current, is, applied, to, the, first, control, grid, g1, to, converge, the, electrons, from, the, hot, cathode, creating, an, electron, beam, g1, in, practice, is, a, wehnelt, cylinder, the, brightness, of, the, screen, is, not, controlled, by, varying, the, anode, voltage, nor, the, electron, beam, current, they, are, never, varied, despite, them, having, an, influence, on, image, brightness, rather, image, brightness, is, controlled, by, varying, the, difference, in, voltage, between, the, cathode, and, the, g1, control, grid, the, second, screen, grid, of, the, gun, g2, then, accelerates, the, electrons, towards, the, screen, using, several, hundred, dc, volts, then, a, third, grid, g3, electrostatically, focuses, the, electron, beam, before, it, is, deflected, and, later, accelerated, by, the, anode, voltage, onto, the, screen, electrostatic, focusing, of, the, electron, beam, may, be, accomplished, using, an, einzel, lens, energized, at, up, to, 600, volts, before, electrostatic, focusing, focusing, the, electron, beam, required, a, large, heavy, and, complex, mechanical, focusing, system, placed, outside, the, electron, gun, however, electrostatic, focusing, cannot, be, accomplished, near, the, final, anode, of, the, crt, due, to, its, high, voltage, in, the, dozens, of, kilovolts, so, a, high, voltage, 600, 8000, v, electrode, together, with, an, electrode, at, the, final, anode, voltage, of, the, crt, may, be, used, for, focusing, instead, such, an, arrangement, is, called, a, bipotential, lens, which, also, offers, higher, performance, than, an, einzel, lens, or, focusing, may, be, accomplished, using, a, magnetic, focusing, coil, together, with, a, high, anode, voltage, of, dozens, of, kilovolts, however, magnetic, focusing, is, expensive, to, implement, so, it, is, rarely, used, in, practice, some, crts, may, use, two, grids, and, lenses, to, focus, the, electron, beam, the, focus, voltage, is, generated, in, the, flyback, using, a, subset, of, the, flyback, s, high, voltage, winding, in, conjunction, with, a, resistive, voltage, divider, the, focus, electrode, is, connected, alongside, the, other, connections, that, are, in, the, neck, of, the, crt, there, is, a, voltage, called, cutoff, voltage, which, is, the, voltage, that, creates, black, on, the, screen, since, it, causes, the, image, on, the, screen, created, by, the, electron, beam, to, disappear, the, voltage, is, applied, to, g1, in, a, color, crt, with, three, guns, the, guns, have, different, cutoff, voltages, many, crts, share, grid, g1, and, g2, across, all, three, guns, increasing, image, brightness, and, simplifying, adjustment, since, on, such, crts, there, is, a, single, cutoff, voltage, for, all, three, guns, since, g1, is, shared, across, all, guns, but, placing, additional, stress, on, the, video, amplifier, used, to, feed, video, into, the, electron, gun, s, cathodes, since, the, cutoff, voltage, becomes, higher, monochrome, crts, do, not, suffer, from, this, problem, in, monochrome, crts, video, is, fed, to, the, gun, by, varying, the, voltage, on, the, first, control, grid, during, retracing, of, the, electron, beam, the, preamplifier, that, feeds, the, video, amplifier, is, disabled, and, the, video, amplifier, is, biased, to, a, voltage, higher, than, the, cutoff, voltage, to, prevent, retrace, lines, from, showing, or, g1, can, have, a, large, negative, voltage, applied, to, it, to, prevent, electrons, from, getting, out, of, the, cathode, this, is, known, as, blanking, see, vertical, blanking, interval, and, horizontal, blanking, interval, incorrect, biasing, can, lead, to, visible, retrace, lines, on, one, or, more, colors, creating, retrace, lines, that, are, tinted, or, white, for, example, tinted, red, if, the, red, color, is, affected, tinted, magenta, if, the, red, and, blue, colors, are, affected, and, white, if, all, colors, are, affected, alternatively, the, amplifier, may, be, driven, by, a, video, processor, that, also, introduces, an, osd, on, screen, display, into, the, video, stream, that, is, fed, into, the, amplifier, using, a, fast, blanking, signal, tv, sets, and, computer, monitors, that, incorporate, crts, need, a, dc, restoration, circuit, to, provide, a, video, signal, to, the, crt, with, a, dc, component, restoring, the, original, brightness, of, different, parts, of, the, image, the, electron, beam, may, be, affected, by, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, causing, it, to, normally, enter, the, focusing, lens, off, center, this, can, be, corrected, using, astigmation, controls, astigmation, controls, are, both, magnetic, and, electronic, dynamic, magnetic, does, most, of, the, work, while, electronic, is, used, for, fine, adjustments, one, of, the, ends, of, the, electron, gun, has, a, glass, disk, the, edges, of, which, are, fused, with, the, edge, of, the, neck, of, the, crt, possibly, using, frit, the, metal, leads, that, connect, the, electron, gun, to, the, outside, pass, through, the, disk, some, electron, guns, have, a, quadrupole, lens, with, dynamic, focus, to, alter, the, shape, and, adjust, the, focus, of, the, electron, beam, varying, the, focus, voltage, depending, on, the, position, of, the, electron, beam, to, maintain, image, sharpness, across, the, entire, screen, specially, at, the, corners, they, may, also, have, a, bleeder, resistor, to, derive, voltages, for, the, grids, from, the, final, anode, voltage, after, the, crts, were, manufactured, they, were, aged, to, allow, cathode, emission, to, stabilize, the, electron, guns, in, color, crts, are, driven, by, a, video, amplifier, which, takes, a, signal, per, color, channel, and, amplifies, it, to, 40, 170, v, per, channel, to, be, fed, into, the, electron, gun, s, cathodes, each, electron, gun, has, its, own, channel, one, per, color, and, all, channels, may, be, driven, by, the, same, amplifier, which, internally, has, three, separate, channels, the, amplifier, s, capabilities, limit, the, resolution, refresh, rate, and, contrast, ratio, of, the, crt, as, the, amplifier, needs, to, provide, high, bandwidth, and, voltage, variations, at, the, same, time, higher, resolutions, and, refresh, rates, need, higher, bandwidths, speed, at, which, voltage, can, be, varied, and, thus, switching, between, black, and, white, and, higher, contrast, ratios, need, higher, voltage, variations, or, amplitude, for, lower, black, and, higher, white, levels, 30mhz, of, bandwidth, can, usually, provide, 720p, or, 1080i, resolution, while, 20mhz, usually, provides, around, 600, horizontal, from, top, to, bottom, lines, of, resolution, for, example, the, difference, in, voltage, between, the, cathode, and, the, control, grid, is, what, modulates, the, electron, beam, modulating, its, current, and, thus, creating, shades, of, colors, which, create, the, image, line, by, line, and, this, can, also, affect, the, brightness, of, the, image, the, phosphors, used, in, color, crts, produce, different, amounts, of, light, for, a, given, amount, of, energy, so, to, produce, white, on, a, color, crt, all, three, guns, must, output, differing, amounts, of, energy, the, gun, that, outputs, the, most, energy, is, the, red, gun, since, the, red, phosphor, emits, the, least, amount, of, light, crts, have, a, pronounced, triode, characteristic, which, results, in, significant, gamma, a, nonlinear, relationship, in, an, electron, gun, between, applied, video, voltage, and, beam, intensity, there, are, two, types, of, deflection, magnetic, and, electrostatic, magnetic, is, usually, used, in, tvs, and, monitors, as, it, allows, for, higher, deflection, angles, and, hence, shallower, crts, and, deflection, power, which, allows, for, higher, electron, beam, current, and, hence, brighter, images, while, avoiding, the, need, for, high, voltages, for, deflection, of, up, to, 2, kv, while, oscilloscopes, often, use, electrostatic, deflection, since, the, raw, waveforms, captured, by, the, oscilloscope, can, be, applied, directly, after, amplification, to, the, vertical, electrostatic, deflection, plates, inside, the, crt, those, that, use, magnetic, deflection, may, use, a, yoke, that, has, two, pairs, of, deflection, coils, one, pair, for, vertical, and, another, for, horizontal, deflection, the, yoke, can, be, bonded, be, integral, or, removable, those, that, were, bonded, used, glue, or, a, plastic, to, bond, the, yoke, to, the, area, between, the, neck, and, the, funnel, of, the, crt, while, those, with, removable, yokes, are, clamped, the, yoke, generates, heat, whose, removal, is, essential, since, the, conductivity, of, glass, goes, up, with, increasing, temperature, the, glass, needs, to, be, insulating, for, the, crt, to, remain, usable, as, a, capacitor, the, temperature, of, the, glass, below, the, yoke, is, thus, checked, during, the, design, of, a, new, yoke, the, yoke, contains, the, deflection, and, convergence, coils, with, a, ferrite, core, to, reduce, loss, of, magnetic, force, as, well, as, the, magnetized, rings, used, to, align, or, adjust, the, electron, beams, in, color, crts, the, color, purity, and, convergence, rings, for, example, and, monochrome, crts, the, yoke, may, be, connected, using, a, connector, the, order, in, which, the, deflection, coils, of, the, yoke, are, connected, determines, the, orientation, of, the, image, displayed, by, the, crt, the, deflection, coils, may, be, held, in, place, using, polyurethane, glue, the, deflection, coils, are, driven, by, sawtooth, signals, that, may, be, delivered, through, vga, as, horizontal, and, vertical, sync, signals, a, crt, needs, two, deflection, circuits, a, horizontal, and, a, vertical, circuit, which, are, similar, except, that, the, horizontal, circuit, runs, at, a, much, higher, frequency, a, horizontal, scan, rate, of, 15, 240, khz, depending, on, the, refresh, rate, of, the, crt, and, the, number, of, horizontal, lines, to, be, drawn, the, vertical, resolution, of, the, crt, the, higher, frequency, makes, it, more, susceptible, to, interference, so, an, automatic, frequency, control, afc, circuit, may, be, used, to, lock, the, phase, of, the, horizontal, deflection, signal, to, that, of, a, sync, signal, to, prevent, the, image, from, becoming, distorted, diagonally, the, vertical, frequency, varies, according, to, the, refresh, rate, of, the, crt, so, a, crt, with, a, 60, hz, refresh, rate, has, a, vertical, deflection, circuit, running, at, 60, hz, the, horizontal, and, vertical, deflection, signals, may, be, generated, using, two, circuits, that, work, differently, the, horizontal, deflection, signal, may, be, generated, using, a, voltage, controlled, oscillator, vco, while, the, vertical, signal, may, be, generated, using, a, triggered, relaxation, oscillator, in, many, tvs, the, frequencies, at, which, the, deflection, coils, run, is, in, part, determined, by, the, inductance, value, of, the, coils, crts, had, differing, deflection, angles, the, higher, the, deflection, angle, the, shallower, the, crt, for, a, given, screen, size, but, at, the, cost, of, more, deflection, power, and, lower, optical, performance, higher, deflection, power, means, more, current, is, sent, to, the, deflection, coils, to, bend, the, electron, beam, at, a, higher, angle, which, in, turn, may, generate, more, heat, or, require, electronics, that, can, handle, the, increased, power, heat, is, generated, due, to, resistive, and, core, losses, the, deflection, power, is, measured, in, ma, per, inch, the, vertical, deflection, coils, may, require, 24, volts, while, the, horizontal, deflection, coils, require, 120, volts, to, operate, the, deflection, coils, are, driven, by, deflection, amplifiers, the, horizontal, deflection, coils, may, also, be, driven, in, part, by, the, horizontal, output, stage, of, a, tv, set, the, stage, contains, a, capacitor, that, is, in, series, with, the, horizontal, deflection, coils, that, performs, several, functions, among, them, are, shaping, the, sawtooth, deflection, signal, to, match, the, curvature, of, the, crt, and, centering, the, image, by, preventing, a, dc, bias, from, developing, on, the, coil, at, the, beginning, of, retrace, the, magnetic, field, of, the, coil, collapses, causing, the, electron, beam, to, return, to, the, center, of, the, screen, while, at, the, same, time, the, coil, returns, energy, into, capacitors, the, energy, of, which, is, then, used, to, force, the, electron, beam, to, go, to, the, left, of, the, screen, due, to, the, high, frequency, at, which, the, horizontal, deflection, coils, operate, the, energy, in, the, deflection, coils, must, be, recycled, to, reduce, heat, dissipation, recycling, is, done, by, transferring, the, energy, in, the, deflection, coils, magnetic, field, to, a, set, of, capacitors, the, voltage, on, the, horizontal, deflection, coils, is, negative, when, the, electron, beam, is, on, the, left, side, of, the, screen, and, positive, when, the, electron, beam, is, on, the, right, side, of, the, screen, the, energy, required, for, deflection, is, dependent, on, the, energy, of, the, electrons, higher, energy, voltage, and, or, current, electron, beams, need, more, energy, to, be, deflected, and, are, used, to, achieve, higher, image, brightness, mostly, used, in, oscilloscopes, deflection, is, carried, out, by, applying, a, voltage, across, two, pairs, of, plates, one, for, horizontal, and, the, other, for, vertical, deflection, the, electron, beam, is, steered, by, varying, the, voltage, difference, across, plates, in, a, pair, for, example, applying, a, voltage, to, the, upper, plate, of, the, vertical, deflection, pair, while, keeping, the, voltage, in, the, bottom, plate, at, 0, volts, will, cause, the, electron, beam, to, be, deflected, towards, the, upper, part, of, the, screen, increasing, the, voltage, in, the, upper, plate, while, keeping, the, bottom, plate, at, 0, will, cause, the, electron, beam, to, be, deflected, to, a, higher, point, in, the, screen, will, cause, the, beam, to, be, deflected, at, a, higher, deflection, angle, the, same, applies, with, the, horizontal, deflection, plates, increasing, the, length, and, proximity, between, plates, in, a, pair, can, also, increase, the, deflection, angle, burn, in, is, when, images, are, physically, burned, into, the, screen, of, the, crt, this, occurs, due, to, degradation, of, the, phosphors, due, to, prolonged, electron, bombardment, of, the, phosphors, and, happens, when, a, fixed, image, or, logo, is, left, for, too, long, on, the, screen, causing, it, to, appear, as, a, ghost, image, or, in, severe, cases, also, when, the, crt, is, off, to, counter, this, screensavers, were, used, in, computers, to, minimize, burn, in, burn, in, is, not, exclusive, to, crts, as, it, also, happens, to, plasma, displays, and, oled, displays, the, crt, s, partial, vacuum, of, 0, 01, pascals, 1, 10, 7, atm, to, 0, 1, micropascals, 1, 10, 12, atm, or, less, is, evacuated, or, exhausted, in, a, 375, 475, c, oven, in, a, process, called, baking, or, bake, out, the, evacuation, process, also, outgasses, any, materials, inside, the, crt, while, decomposing, others, such, as, the, polyvinyl, alcohol, used, to, apply, the, phosphors, the, heating, and, cooling, are, done, gradually, to, avoid, inducing, stress, stiffening, and, possibly, cracking, the, glass, the, oven, heats, the, gases, inside, the, crt, increasing, the, speed, of, the, gas, molecules, which, increases, the, chances, of, them, getting, drawn, out, by, the, vacuum, pump, the, temperature, of, the, crt, is, kept, to, below, that, of, the, oven, and, the, oven, starts, to, cool, just, after, the, crt, reaches, 400, c, or, the, crt, was, kept, at, a, temperature, higher, than, 400, c, for, up, to, 15, 55, minutes, the, crt, was, heated, during, or, after, evacuation, and, the, heat, may, have, been, used, simultaneously, to, melt, the, frit, in, the, crt, joining, the, screen, and, funnel, the, pump, used, is, a, turbomolecular, pump, or, a, diffusion, pump, formerly, mercury, vacuum, pumps, were, also, used, after, baking, the, crt, is, disconnected, sealed, or, tipped, off, from, the, vacuum, pump, the, getter, is, then, fired, using, an, rf, induction, coil, the, getter, is, usually, in, the, funnel, or, in, the, neck, of, the, crt, the, getter, material, which, is, often, barium, based, catches, any, remaining, gas, particles, as, it, evaporates, due, to, heating, induced, by, the, rf, coil, that, may, be, combined, with, exothermic, heating, within, the, material, the, vapor, fills, the, crt, trapping, any, gas, molecules, that, it, encounters, and, condenses, on, the, inside, of, the, crt, forming, a, layer, that, contains, trapped, gas, molecules, hydrogen, may, be, present, in, the, material, to, help, distribute, the, barium, vapor, the, material, is, heated, to, temperatures, above, 1000, c, causing, it, to, evaporate, partial, loss, of, vacuum, in, a, crt, can, result, in, a, hazy, image, blue, glowing, in, the, neck, of, the, crt, flashovers, loss, of, cathode, emission, or, focusing, problems, crts, used, to, be, rebuilt, repaired, or, refurbished, the, rebuilding, process, included, the, disassembly, of, the, crt, the, disassembly, and, repair, or, replacement, of, the, electron, gun, s, the, removal, and, redeposition, of, phosphors, and, aquadag, etc, rebuilding, was, popular, until, the, 1960s, because, crts, were, expensive, and, wore, out, quickly, making, repair, worth, it, the, last, crt, rebuilder, in, the, us, closed, in, 2010, and, the, last, in, europe, racs, which, was, located, in, france, closed, in, 2013, also, known, as, rejuvenation, the, goal, is, to, temporarily, restore, the, brightness, of, a, worn, crt, this, is, often, done, by, carefully, increasing, the, voltage, on, the, cathode, heater, and, the, current, and, voltage, on, the, control, grids, of, the, electron, gun, manually, some, rejuvenators, can, also, fix, heater, to, cathode, shorts, by, running, a, capacitive, discharge, through, the, short, phosphors, in, crts, emit, secondary, electrons, due, to, them, being, inside, the, vacuum, of, the, crt, the, secondary, electrons, are, collected, by, the, anode, of, the, crt, secondary, electrons, generated, by, phosphors, need, to, be, collected, to, prevent, charges, from, developing, in, the, screen, which, would, lead, to, reduced, image, brightness, since, the, charge, would, repel, the, electron, beam, the, phosphors, used, in, crts, often, contain, rare, earth, metals, replacing, earlier, dimmer, phosphors, early, red, and, green, phosphors, contained, cadmium, and, some, black, and, white, crt, phosphors, also, contained, beryllium, in, the, form, of, zinc, beryllium, silicate, although, white, phosphors, containing, cadmium, zinc, and, magnesium, with, silver, copper, or, manganese, as, dopants, were, also, used, the, rare, earth, phosphors, used, in, crts, are, more, efficient, produce, more, light, than, earlier, phosphors, the, phosphors, adhere, to, the, screen, because, of, van, der, waals, and, electrostatic, forces, phosphors, composed, of, smaller, particles, adhere, more, strongly, to, the, screen, the, phosphors, together, with, the, carbon, used, to, prevent, light, bleeding, in, color, crts, can, be, easily, removed, by, scratching, several, dozen, types, of, phosphors, were, available, for, crts, phosphors, were, classified, according, to, color, persistence, luminance, rise, and, fall, curves, color, depending, on, anode, voltage, for, phosphors, used, in, penetration, crts, intended, use, chemical, composition, safety, sensitivity, to, burn, in, and, secondary, emission, properties, examples, of, rare, earth, phosphors, are, yttrium, oxide, for, red, and, yttrium, silicide, for, blue, in, beam, index, tubes, while, examples, of, earlier, phosphors, are, copper, cadmium, sulfide, for, red, smpte, c, phosphors, have, properties, defined, by, the, smpte, c, standard, which, defines, a, color, space, of, the, same, name, the, standard, prioritizes, accurate, color, reproduction, which, was, made, difficult, by, the, different, phosphors, and, color, spaces, used, in, the, ntsc, and, pal, color, systems, pal, tv, sets, have, subjectively, better, color, reproduction, due, to, the, use, of, saturated, green, phosphors, which, have, relatively, long, decay, times, that, are, tolerated, in, pal, since, there, is, more, time, in, pal, for, phosphors, to, decay, due, to, its, lower, framerate, smpte, c, phosphors, were, used, in, professional, video, monitors, the, phosphor, coating, on, monochrome, and, color, crts, may, have, an, aluminum, coating, on, its, rear, side, used, to, reflect, light, forward, provide, protection, against, ions, to, prevent, ion, burn, by, negative, ions, on, the, phosphor, manage, heat, generated, by, electrons, colliding, against, the, phosphor, prevent, static, build, up, that, could, repel, electrons, from, the, screen, form, part, of, the, anode, and, collect, the, secondary, electrons, generated, by, the, phosphors, in, the, screen, after, being, hit, by, the, electron, beam, providing, the, electrons, with, a, return, path, the, electron, beam, passes, through, the, aluminum, coating, before, hitting, the, phosphors, on, the, screen, the, aluminum, attenuates, the, electron, beam, voltage, by, about, 1, kv, a, film, or, lacquer, may, be, applied, to, the, phosphors, to, reduce, the, surface, roughness, of, the, surface, formed, by, the, phosphors, to, allow, the, aluminum, coating, to, have, a, uniform, surface, and, prevent, it, from, touching, the, glass, of, the, screen, this, is, known, as, filming, the, lacquer, contains, solvents, that, are, later, evaporated, the, lacquer, may, be, chemically, roughened, to, cause, an, aluminum, coating, with, holes, to, be, created, to, allow, the, solvents, to, escape, various, phosphors, are, available, depending, upon, the, needs, of, the, measurement, or, display, application, the, brightness, color, and, persistence, of, the, illumination, depends, upon, the, type, of, phosphor, used, on, the, crt, screen, phosphors, are, available, with, persistences, ranging, from, less, than, one, microsecond, to, several, seconds, for, visual, observation, of, brief, transient, events, a, long, persistence, phosphor, may, be, desirable, for, events, which, are, fast, and, repetitive, or, high, frequency, a, short, persistence, phosphor, is, generally, preferable, the, phosphor, persistence, must, be, low, enough, to, avoid, smearing, or, ghosting, artifacts, at, high, refresh, rates, variations, in, anode, voltage, can, lead, to, variations, in, brightness, in, parts, or, all, of, the, image, in, addition, to, blooming, shrinkage, or, the, image, getting, zoomed, in, or, out, lower, voltages, lead, to, blooming, and, zooming, in, while, higher, voltages, do, the, opposite, some, blooming, is, unavoidable, which, can, be, seen, as, bright, areas, of, an, image, that, expand, distorting, or, pushing, aside, surrounding, darker, areas, of, the, same, image, blooming, occurs, because, bright, areas, have, a, higher, electron, beam, current, from, the, electron, gun, making, the, beam, wider, and, harder, to, focus, poor, voltage, regulation, causes, focus, and, anode, voltage, to, go, down, with, increasing, electron, beam, current, doming, is, a, phenomenon, found, on, some, crt, tvs, in, which, parts, of, the, shadow, mask, become, heated, in, tvs, that, exhibit, this, behavior, it, tends, to, occur, in, high, contrast, scenes, in, which, there, is, a, largely, dark, scene, with, one, or, more, localized, bright, spots, as, the, electron, beam, hits, the, shadow, mask, in, these, areas, it, heats, unevenly, the, shadow, mask, warps, due, to, the, heat, differences, which, causes, the, electron, gun, to, hit, the, wrong, colored, phosphors, and, incorrect, colors, to, be, displayed, in, the, affected, area, thermal, expansion, causes, the, shadow, mask, to, expand, by, around, 100, microns, during, normal, operation, the, shadow, mask, is, heated, to, around, 80, 90, c, bright, areas, of, images, heat, the, shadow, mask, more, than, dark, areas, leading, to, uneven, heating, of, the, shadow, mask, and, warping, blooming, due, to, thermal, expansion, caused, by, heating, by, increased, electron, beam, current, the, shadow, mask, is, usually, made, of, steel, but, it, can, be, made, of, invar, a, low, thermal, expansion, nickel, iron, alloy, as, it, withstands, two, to, three, times, more, current, than, conventional, masks, without, noticeable, warping, while, making, higher, resolution, crts, easier, to, achieve, coatings, that, dissipate, heat, may, be, applied, on, the, shadow, mask, to, limit, blooming, in, a, process, called, blackening, bimetal, springs, may, be, used, in, crts, used, in, tvs, to, compensate, for, warping, that, occurs, as, the, electron, beam, heats, the, shadow, mask, causing, thermal, expansion, the, shadow, mask, is, installed, to, the, screen, using, metal, pieces, or, a, rail, or, frame, that, is, fused, to, the, funnel, or, the, screen, glass, respectively, holding, the, shadow, mask, in, tension, to, minimize, warping, if, the, mask, is, flat, used, in, flat, screen, crt, computer, monitors, and, allowing, for, higher, image, brightness, and, contrast, aperture, grille, screens, are, brighter, since, they, allow, more, electrons, through, but, they, require, support, wires, they, are, also, more, resistant, to, warping, color, crts, need, higher, anode, voltages, than, monochrome, crts, to, achieve, the, same, brightness, since, the, shadow, mask, blocks, most, of, the, electron, beam, slot, masks, and, specially, aperture, grilles, do, not, block, as, many, electrons, resulting, in, a, brighter, image, for, a, given, anode, voltage, but, aperture, grille, crts, are, heavier, shadow, masks, block, 80, 85, of, the, electron, beam, while, aperture, grilles, allow, more, electrons, to, pass, through, image, brightness, is, related, to, the, anode, voltage, and, to, the, crts, size, so, higher, voltages, are, needed, for, both, larger, screens, and, higher, image, brightness, image, brightness, is, also, controlled, by, the, current, of, the, electron, beam, higher, anode, voltages, and, electron, beam, currents, also, mean, higher, amounts, of, x, rays, and, heat, generation, since, the, electrons, have, a, higher, speed, and, energy, leaded, glass, and, special, barium, strontium, glass, are, used, to, block, most, x, ray, emissions, a, practical, limit, on, the, size, of, a, crt, is, the, weight, of, the, thick, glass, needed, to, safely, sustain, its, vacuum, since, a, crt, s, exterior, is, exposed, to, the, full, atmospheric, pressure, which, for, instance, totals, 5, 800, pounds, force, 26, 000, n, on, a, 27, inch, 400, in, 2, screen, for, example, the, large, 43, inch, sony, pvm, 4300, weighs, 440, lb, or, 200, kg, much, heavier, than, 32, inch, crts, up, to, 163, lb, or, 74, kg, and, 19, inch, crts, up, to, 60, lb, or, 27, kg, much, lighter, flat, panel, tvs, are, only, 18, lb, 8, 2, kg, for, 32, inch, and, 6, 5, lb, 2, 9, kg, for, 19, inch, size, is, also, limited, by, anode, voltage, as, it, would, require, a, higher, dielectric, strength, to, prevent, arcing, and, the, electrical, losses, and, ozone, generation, it, causes, without, sacrificing, image, brightness, shadow, masks, also, become, more, difficult, to, make, with, increasing, resolution, and, size, at, high, deflection, angles, resolutions, and, refresh, rates, since, higher, resolutions, and, refresh, rates, require, significantly, higher, frequencies, to, be, applied, to, the, horizontal, deflection, coils, the, deflection, yoke, starts, to, produce, large, amounts, of, heat, due, to, the, need, to, move, the, electron, beam, at, a, higher, angle, which, in, turn, requires, exponentially, larger, amounts, of, power, as, an, example, to, increase, the, deflection, angle, from, 90, to, 120, power, consumption, of, the, yoke, must, also, go, up, from, 40, watts, to, 80, watts, and, to, increase, it, further, from, 120, to, 150, deflection, power, must, again, go, up, from, 80, to, 160, watts, this, normally, makes, crts, that, go, beyond, certain, deflection, angles, resolutions, and, refresh, rates, impractical, since, the, coils, would, generate, too, much, heat, due, to, resistance, caused, by, the, skin, effect, surface, and, eddy, current, losses, and, or, possibly, causing, the, glass, underneath, the, coil, to, become, conductive, as, the, electrical, conductivity, of, glass, decreases, with, increasing, temperature, some, deflection, yokes, are, designed, to, dissipate, the, heat, that, comes, from, their, operation, higher, deflection, angles, in, color, crts, directly, affect, convergence, at, the, corners, of, the, screen, which, requires, additional, compensation, circuitry, to, handle, electron, beam, power, and, shape, leading, to, higher, costs, and, power, consumption, higher, deflection, angles, allow, a, crt, of, a, given, size, to, be, slimmer, however, they, also, impose, more, stress, on, the, crt, envelope, specially, on, the, panel, the, seal, between, the, panel, and, funnel, and, on, the, funnel, the, funnel, needs, to, be, long, enough, to, minimize, stress, as, a, longer, funnel, can, be, better, shaped, to, have, lower, stress, on, crts, refresh, rate, depends, on, resolution, both, of, which, are, ultimately, limited, by, the, maximum, horizontal, scanning, frequency, of, the, crt, motion, blur, also, depends, on, the, decay, time, of, the, phosphors, phosphors, that, decay, too, slowly, for, a, given, refresh, rate, may, cause, smearing, or, motion, blur, on, the, image, in, practice, crts, are, limited, to, a, refresh, rate, of, 160, hz, lcds, that, can, compete, with, oled, dual, layer, and, mini, led, lcds, are, not, available, in, high, refresh, rates, although, quantum, dot, lcds, qleds, are, available, in, high, refresh, rates, up, to, 144, hz, and, are, competitive, in, color, reproduction, with, oleds, crt, monitors, can, still, outperform, lcd, and, oled, monitors, in, input, lag, as, there, is, no, signal, processing, between, the, crt, and, the, display, connector, of, the, monitor, since, crt, monitors, often, use, vga, which, provides, an, analog, signal, that, can, be, fed, to, a, crt, directly, video, cards, designed, for, use, with, crts, may, have, a, ramdac, to, generate, the, analog, signals, needed, by, the, crt, also, crt, monitors, are, often, capable, of, displaying, sharp, images, at, several, resolutions, an, ability, known, as, multisyncing, due, to, these, reasons, crts, are, sometimes, preferred, by, pc, gamers, in, spite, of, their, bulk, weight, and, heat, generation, crts, tend, to, be, more, durable, than, their, flat, panel, counterparts, though, specialised, lcds, that, have, similar, durability, also, exist, crts, were, produced, in, two, major, categories, picture, tubes, and, display, tubes, picture, tubes, were, used, in, tvs, while, display, tubes, were, used, in, computer, monitors, display, tubes, were, of, higher, resolution, and, when, used, in, computer, monitors, sometimes, had, adjustable, overscan, or, sometimes, underscan, picture, tube, crts, have, overscan, meaning, the, actual, edges, of, the, image, are, not, shown, this, is, deliberate, to, allow, for, adjustment, variations, between, crt, tvs, preventing, the, ragged, edges, due, to, blooming, of, the, image, from, being, shown, on, screen, the, shadow, mask, may, have, grooves, that, reflect, away, the, electrons, that, do, not, hit, the, screen, due, to, overscan, color, picture, tubes, used, in, tvs, were, also, known, as, cpts, crts, are, also, sometimes, called, braun, tubes, if, the, crt, is, a, black, and, white, b, w, or, monochrome, crt, there, is, a, single, electron, gun, in, the, neck, and, the, funnel, is, coated, on, the, inside, with, aluminum, that, has, been, applied, by, evaporation, the, aluminum, is, evaporated, in, a, vacuum, and, allowed, to, condense, on, the, inside, of, the, crt, aluminum, eliminates, the, need, for, ion, traps, necessary, to, prevent, ion, burn, on, the, phosphor, while, also, reflecting, light, generated, by, the, phosphor, towards, the, screen, managing, heat, and, absorbing, electrons, providing, a, return, path, for, them, previously, funnels, were, coated, on, the, inside, with, aquadag, used, because, it, can, be, applied, like, paint, the, phosphors, were, left, uncoated, aluminum, started, being, applied, to, crts, in, the, 1950s, coating, the, inside, of, the, crt, including, the, phosphors, which, also, increased, image, brightness, since, the, aluminum, reflected, light, that, would, otherwise, be, lost, inside, the, crt, towards, the, outside, of, the, crt, in, aluminized, monochrome, crts, aquadag, is, used, on, the, outside, there, is, a, single, aluminum, coating, covering, the, funnel, and, the, screen, the, screen, funnel, and, neck, are, fused, together, into, a, single, envelope, possibly, using, lead, enamel, seals, a, hole, is, made, in, the, funnel, onto, which, the, anode, cap, is, installed, and, the, phosphor, aquadag, and, aluminum, are, applied, afterwards, previously, monochrome, crts, used, ion, traps, that, required, magnets, the, magnet, was, used, to, deflect, the, electrons, away, from, the, more, difficult, to, deflect, ions, letting, the, electrons, through, while, letting, the, ions, collide, into, a, sheet, of, metal, inside, the, electron, gun, ion, burn, results, in, premature, wear, of, the, phosphor, since, ions, are, harder, to, deflect, than, electrons, ion, burn, leaves, a, black, dot, in, the, center, of, the, screen, the, interior, aquadag, or, aluminum, coating, was, the, anode, and, served, to, accelerate, the, electrons, towards, the, screen, collect, them, after, hitting, the, screen, while, serving, as, a, capacitor, together, with, the, outer, aquadag, coating, the, screen, has, a, single, uniform, phosphor, coating, and, no, shadow, mask, technically, having, no, resolution, limit, monochrome, crts, may, use, ring, magnets, to, adjust, the, centering, of, the, electron, beam, and, magnets, around, the, deflection, yoke, to, adjust, the, geometry, of, the, image, color, crts, use, three, different, phosphors, which, emit, red, green, and, blue, light, respectively, they, are, packed, together, in, stripes, as, in, aperture, grille, designs, or, clusters, called, triads, as, in, shadow, mask, crts, color, crts, have, three, electron, guns, one, for, each, primary, color, red, green, and, blue, arranged, either, in, a, straight, line, in, line, or, in, an, equilateral, triangular, configuration, the, guns, are, usually, constructed, as, a, single, unit, the, triangular, configuration, is, often, called, delta, gun, based, on, its, relation, to, the, shape, of, the, greek, letter, delta, the, arrangement, of, the, phosphors, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, electron, guns, a, grille, or, mask, absorbs, the, electrons, that, would, otherwise, hit, the, wrong, phosphor, a, shadow, mask, tube, uses, a, metal, plate, with, tiny, holes, typically, in, a, delta, configuration, placed, so, that, the, electron, beam, only, illuminates, the, correct, phosphors, on, the, face, of, the, tube, blocking, all, other, electrons, shadow, masks, that, use, slots, instead, of, holes, are, known, as, slot, masks, the, holes, or, slots, are, tapered, so, that, the, electrons, that, strike, the, inside, of, any, hole, will, be, reflected, back, if, they, are, not, absorbed, e, g, due, to, local, charge, accumulation, instead, of, bouncing, through, the, hole, to, strike, a, random, wrong, spot, on, the, screen, another, type, of, color, crt, trinitron, uses, an, aperture, grille, of, tensioned, vertical, wires, to, achieve, the, same, result, the, shadow, mask, has, a, single, hole, for, each, triad, the, shadow, mask, is, usually, 1, 2, inch, behind, the, screen, trinitron, crts, were, different, from, other, color, crts, in, that, they, had, a, single, electron, gun, with, three, cathodes, an, aperture, grille, which, lets, more, electrons, through, increasing, image, brightness, since, the, aperture, grille, does, not, block, as, many, electrons, and, a, vertically, cylindrical, screen, rather, than, a, curved, screen, the, three, electron, guns, are, in, the, neck, except, for, trinitrons, and, the, red, green, and, blue, phosphors, on, the, screen, may, be, separated, by, a, black, grid, or, matrix, called, black, stripe, by, toshiba, the, funnel, is, coated, with, aquadag, on, both, sides, while, the, screen, has, a, separate, aluminum, coating, applied, in, a, vacuum, deposited, after, the, phosphor, coating, is, applied, facing, the, electron, gun, the, aluminum, coating, protects, the, phosphor, from, ions, absorbs, secondary, electrons, providing, them, with, a, return, path, preventing, them, from, electrostatically, charging, the, screen, which, would, then, repel, electrons, and, reduce, image, brightness, reflects, the, light, from, the, phosphors, forwards, and, helps, manage, heat, it, also, serves, as, the, anode, of, the, crt, together, with, the, inner, aquadag, coating, the, inner, coating, is, electrically, connected, to, an, electrode, of, the, electron, gun, using, springs, forming, the, final, anode, the, outer, aquadag, coating, is, connected, to, ground, possibly, using, a, series, of, springs, or, a, harness, that, makes, contact, with, the, aquadag, the, shadow, mask, absorbs, or, reflects, electrons, that, would, otherwise, strike, the, wrong, phosphor, dots, causing, color, purity, issues, discoloration, of, images, in, other, words, when, set, up, correctly, the, shadow, mask, helps, ensure, color, purity, when, the, electrons, strike, the, shadow, mask, they, release, their, energy, as, heat, and, x, rays, if, the, electrons, have, too, much, energy, due, to, an, anode, voltage, that, is, too, high, for, example, the, shadow, mask, can, warp, due, to, the, heat, which, can, also, happen, during, the, lehr, baking, at, 435, c, of, the, frit, seal, between, the, faceplate, and, the, funnel, of, the, crt, shadow, masks, were, replaced, in, tvs, by, slot, masks, in, the, 1970s, since, slot, masks, let, more, electrons, through, increasing, image, brightness, shadow, masks, may, be, connected, electrically, to, the, anode, of, the, crt, trinitron, used, a, single, electron, gun, with, three, cathodes, instead, of, three, complete, guns, crt, pc, monitors, usually, use, shadow, masks, except, for, sony, s, trinitron, mitsubishi, s, diamondtron, and, nec, s, cromaclear, trinitron, and, diamondtron, use, aperture, grilles, while, cromaclear, uses, a, slot, mask, some, shadow, mask, crts, have, color, phosphors, that, are, smaller, in, diameter, than, the, electron, beams, used, to, light, them, with, the, intention, being, to, cover, the, entire, phosphor, increasing, image, brightness, shadow, masks, may, be, pressed, into, a, curved, shape, early, color, crts, did, not, have, a, black, matrix, which, was, introduced, by, zenith, in, 1969, and, panasonic, in, 1970, the, black, matrix, eliminates, light, leaking, from, one, phosphor, to, another, since, the, black, matrix, isolates, the, phosphor, dots, from, one, another, so, part, of, the, electron, beam, touches, the, black, matrix, this, is, also, made, necessary, by, warping, of, the, shadow, mask, light, bleeding, may, still, occur, due, to, stray, electrons, striking, the, wrong, phosphor, dots, at, high, resolutions, and, refresh, rates, phosphors, only, receive, a, very, small, amount, of, energy, limiting, image, brightness, several, methods, were, used, to, create, the, black, matrix, one, method, coated, the, screen, in, photoresist, such, as, dichromate, sensitized, polyvinyl, alcohol, photoresist, which, was, then, dried, and, exposed, the, unexposed, areas, were, removed, and, the, entire, screen, was, coated, in, colloidal, graphite, to, create, a, carbon, film, and, then, hydrogen, peroxide, was, used, to, remove, the, remaining, photoresist, alongside, the, carbon, that, was, on, top, of, it, creating, holes, that, in, turn, created, the, black, matrix, the, photoresist, had, to, be, of, the, correct, thickness, to, ensure, sufficient, adhesion, to, the, screen, while, the, exposure, step, had, to, be, controlled, to, avoid, holes, that, were, too, small, or, large, with, ragged, edges, caused, by, light, diffraction, ultimately, limiting, the, maximum, resolution, of, large, color, crts, the, holes, were, then, filled, with, phosphor, using, the, method, described, above, another, method, used, phosphors, suspended, in, an, aromatic, diazonium, salt, that, adhered, to, the, screen, when, exposed, to, light, the, phosphors, were, applied, then, exposed, to, cause, them, to, adhere, to, the, screen, repeating, the, process, once, for, each, color, then, carbon, was, applied, to, the, remaining, areas, of, the, screen, while, exposing, the, entire, screen, to, light, to, create, the, black, matrix, and, a, fixing, process, using, an, aqueous, polymer, solution, was, applied, to, the, screen, to, make, the, phosphors, and, black, matrix, resistant, to, water, black, chromium, may, be, used, instead, of, carbon, in, the, black, matrix, other, methods, were, also, used, the, phosphors, are, applied, using, photolithography, the, inner, side, of, the, screen, is, coated, with, phosphor, particles, suspended, in, pva, photoresist, slurry, which, is, then, dried, using, infrared, light, exposed, and, developed, the, exposure, is, done, using, a, lighthouse, that, uses, an, ultraviolet, light, source, with, a, corrector, lens, to, allow, the, crt, to, achieve, color, purity, removable, shadow, masks, with, spring, loaded, clips, are, used, as, photomasks, the, process, is, repeated, with, all, colors, usually, the, green, phosphor, is, the, first, to, be, applied, after, phosphor, application, the, screen, is, baked, to, eliminate, any, organic, chemicals, such, as, the, pva, that, was, used, to, deposit, the, phosphor, that, may, remain, on, the, screen, alternatively, the, phosphors, may, be, applied, in, a, vacuum, chamber, by, evaporating, them, and, allowing, them, to, condense, on, the, screen, creating, a, very, uniform, coating, early, color, crts, had, their, phosphors, deposited, using, silkscreen, printing, phosphors, may, have, color, filters, over, them, facing, the, viewer, contain, pigment, of, the, color, emitted, by, the, phosphor, or, be, encapsulated, in, color, filters, to, improve, color, purity, and, reproduction, while, reducing, glare, this, technology, was, sold, by, toshiba, under, the, microfilter, brand, name, poor, exposure, due, to, insufficient, light, leads, to, poor, phosphor, adhesion, to, the, screen, which, limits, the, maximum, resolution, of, a, crt, as, the, smaller, phosphor, dots, required, for, higher, resolutions, cannot, receive, as, much, light, due, to, their, smaller, size, after, the, screen, is, coated, with, phosphor, and, aluminum, and, the, shadow, mask, installed, onto, it, the, screen, is, bonded, to, the, funnel, using, a, glass, frit, that, may, contain, 65, 88, of, lead, oxide, by, weight, the, lead, oxide, is, necessary, for, the, glass, frit, to, have, a, low, melting, temperature, boron, oxide, iii, may, also, present, to, stabilize, the, frit, with, alumina, powder, as, filler, powder, to, control, the, thermal, expansion, of, the, frit, the, frit, may, be, applied, as, a, paste, consisting, of, frit, particles, suspended, in, amyl, acetate, or, in, a, polymer, with, an, alkyl, methacrylate, monomer, together, with, an, organic, solvent, to, dissolve, the, polymer, and, monomer, the, crt, is, then, baked, in, an, oven, in, what, is, called, a, lehr, bake, to, cure, the, frit, sealing, the, funnel, and, screen, together, the, frit, contains, a, large, quantity, of, lead, causing, color, crts, to, contain, more, lead, than, their, monochrome, counterparts, monochrome, crts, on, the, other, hand, do, not, require, frit, the, funnel, can, be, fused, directly, to, the, glass, by, melting, and, joining, the, edges, of, the, funnel, and, screen, using, gas, flames, frit, is, used, in, color, crts, to, prevent, deformation, of, the, shadow, mask, and, screen, during, the, fusing, process, the, edges, of, the, screen, and, the, edges, of, funnel, of, the, crt, that, mate, with, the, screen, are, never, melted, a, primer, may, be, applied, on, the, edges, of, the, funnel, and, screen, before, the, frit, paste, is, applied, to, improve, adhesion, the, lehr, bake, consists, of, several, successive, steps, that, heat, and, then, cool, the, crt, gradually, until, it, reaches, a, temperature, of, 435, 475, c, other, sources, may, state, different, temperatures, such, as, 440, c, after, the, lehr, bake, the, crt, is, flushed, with, air, or, nitrogen, to, remove, contaminants, the, electron, gun, is, inserted, and, sealed, into, the, neck, of, the, crt, and, a, vacuum, is, formed, on, the, crt, due, to, limitations, in, the, dimensional, precision, with, which, crts, can, be, manufactured, economically, it, has, not, been, practically, possible, to, build, color, crts, in, which, three, electron, beams, could, be, aligned, to, hit, phosphors, of, respective, color, in, acceptable, coordination, solely, on, the, basis, of, the, geometric, configuration, of, the, electron, gun, axes, and, gun, aperture, positions, shadow, mask, apertures, etc, the, shadow, mask, ensures, that, one, beam, will, only, hit, spots, of, certain, colors, of, phosphors, but, minute, variations, in, physical, alignment, of, the, internal, parts, among, individual, crts, will, cause, variations, in, the, exact, alignment, of, the, beams, through, the, shadow, mask, allowing, some, electrons, from, for, example, the, red, beam, to, hit, say, blue, phosphors, unless, some, individual, compensation, is, made, for, the, variance, among, individual, tubes, color, convergence, and, color, purity, are, two, aspects, of, this, single, problem, firstly, for, correct, color, rendering, it, is, necessary, that, regardless, of, where, the, beams, are, deflected, on, the, screen, all, three, hit, the, same, spot, and, nominally, pass, through, the, same, hole, or, slot, on, the, shadow, mask, this, is, called, convergence, more, specifically, the, convergence, at, the, center, of, the, screen, with, no, deflection, field, applied, by, the, yoke, is, called, static, convergence, and, the, convergence, over, the, rest, of, the, screen, area, specially, at, the, edges, and, corners, is, called, dynamic, convergence, the, beams, may, converge, at, the, center, of, the, screen, and, yet, stray, from, each, other, as, they, are, deflected, toward, the, edges, such, a, crt, would, be, said, to, have, good, static, convergence, but, poor, dynamic, convergence, secondly, each, beam, must, only, strike, the, phosphors, of, the, color, it, is, intended, to, strike, and, no, others, this, is, called, purity, like, convergence, there, is, static, purity, and, dynamic, purity, with, the, same, meanings, of, static, and, dynamic, as, for, convergence, convergence, and, purity, are, distinct, parameters, a, crt, could, have, good, purity, but, poor, convergence, or, vice, versa, poor, convergence, causes, color, shadows, or, ghosts, along, displayed, edges, and, contours, as, if, the, image, on, the, screen, were, intaglio, printed, with, poor, registration, poor, purity, causes, objects, on, the, screen, to, appear, off, color, while, their, edges, remain, sharp, purity, and, convergence, problems, can, occur, at, the, same, time, in, the, same, or, different, areas, of, the, screen, or, both, over, the, whole, screen, and, either, uniformly, or, to, greater, or, lesser, degrees, over, different, parts, of, the, screen, the, solution, to, the, static, convergence, and, purity, problems, is, a, set, of, color, alignment, ring, magnets, installed, around, the, neck, of, the, crt, these, movable, weak, permanent, magnets, are, usually, mounted, on, the, back, end, of, the, deflection, yoke, assembly, and, are, set, at, the, factory, to, compensate, for, any, static, purity, and, convergence, errors, that, are, intrinsic, to, the, unadjusted, tube, typically, there, are, two, or, three, pairs, of, two, magnets, in, the, form, of, rings, made, of, plastic, impregnated, with, a, magnetic, material, with, their, magnetic, fields, parallel, to, the, planes, of, the, magnets, which, are, perpendicular, to, the, electron, gun, axes, often, one, pair, of, rings, has, 2, poles, another, has, 4, and, the, remaining, ring, has, 6, poles, each, pair, of, magnetic, rings, forms, a, single, effective, magnet, whose, field, vector, can, be, fully, and, freely, adjusted, in, both, direction, and, magnitude, by, rotating, a, pair, of, magnets, relative, to, each, other, their, relative, field, alignment, can, be, varied, adjusting, the, effective, field, strength, of, the, pair, as, they, rotate, relative, to, each, other, each, magnet, s, field, can, be, considered, to, have, two, opposing, components, at, right, angles, and, these, four, components, form, two, pairs, one, pair, reinforcing, each, other, and, the, other, pair, opposing, and, canceling, each, other, rotating, away, from, alignment, the, magnets, mutually, reinforcing, field, components, decrease, as, they, are, traded, for, increasing, opposed, mutually, cancelling, components, by, rotating, a, pair, of, magnets, together, preserving, the, relative, angle, between, them, the, direction, of, their, collective, magnetic, field, can, be, varied, overall, adjusting, all, of, the, convergence, purity, magnets, allows, a, finely, tuned, slight, electron, beam, deflection, or, lateral, offset, to, be, applied, which, compensates, for, minor, static, convergence, and, purity, errors, intrinsic, to, the, uncalibrated, tube, once, set, these, magnets, are, usually, glued, in, place, but, normally, they, can, be, freed, and, readjusted, in, the, field, e, g, by, a, tv, repair, shop, if, necessary, on, some, crts, additional, fixed, adjustable, magnets, are, added, for, dynamic, convergence, or, dynamic, purity, at, specific, points, on, the, screen, typically, near, the, corners, or, edges, further, adjustment, of, dynamic, convergence, and, purity, typically, cannot, be, done, passively, but, requires, active, compensation, circuits, one, to, correct, convergence, horizontally, and, another, to, correct, it, vertically, in, this, case, the, deflection, yoke, contains, convergence, coils, a, set, of, two, per, color, wound, on, the, same, core, to, which, the, convergence, signals, are, applied, that, means, 6, convergence, coils, in, groups, of, 3, with, 2, coils, per, group, with, one, coil, for, horizontal, convergence, correction, and, another, for, vertical, convergence, correction, with, each, group, sharing, a, core, the, groups, are, separated, 120, from, one, another, dynamic, convergence, is, necessary, because, the, front, of, the, crt, and, the, shadow, mask, are, not, spherical, compensating, for, electron, beam, defocusing, and, astigmatism, the, fact, that, the, crt, screen, is, not, spherical, leads, to, geometry, problems, which, may, be, corrected, using, a, circuit, the, signals, used, for, convergence, are, parabolic, waveforms, derived, from, three, signals, coming, from, a, vertical, output, circuit, the, parabolic, signal, is, fed, into, the, convergence, coils, while, the, other, two, are, sawtooth, signals, that, when, mixed, with, the, parabolic, signals, create, the, necessary, signal, for, convergence, a, resistor, and, diode, are, used, to, lock, the, convergence, signal, to, the, center, of, the, screen, to, prevent, it, from, being, affected, by, the, static, convergence, the, horizontal, and, vertical, convergence, circuits, are, similar, each, circuit, has, two, resonators, one, usually, tuned, to, 15, 625, hz, and, the, other, to, 31, 250, hz, which, set, the, frequency, of, the, signal, sent, to, the, convergence, coils, dynamic, convergence, may, be, accomplished, using, electrostatic, quadrupole, fields, in, the, electron, gun, dynamic, convergence, means, that, the, electron, beam, does, not, travel, in, a, perfectly, straight, line, between, the, deflection, coils, and, the, screen, since, the, convergence, coils, cause, it, to, become, curved, to, conform, to, the, screen, the, convergence, signal, may, instead, be, a, sawtooth, signal, with, a, slight, sine, wave, appearance, the, sine, wave, part, is, created, using, a, capacitor, in, series, with, each, deflection, coil, in, this, case, the, convergence, signal, is, used, to, drive, the, deflection, coils, the, sine, wave, part, of, the, signal, causes, the, electron, beam, to, move, more, slowly, near, the, edges, of, the, screen, the, capacitors, used, to, create, the, convergence, signal, are, known, as, the, s, capacitors, this, type, of, convergence, is, necessary, due, to, the, high, deflection, angles, and, flat, screens, of, many, crt, computer, monitors, the, value, of, the, s, capacitors, must, be, chosen, based, on, the, scan, rate, of, the, crt, so, multi, syncing, monitors, must, have, different, sets, of, s, capacitors, one, for, each, refresh, rate, dynamic, convergence, may, instead, be, accomplished, in, some, crts, using, only, the, ring, magnets, magnets, glued, to, the, crt, and, by, varying, the, position, of, the, deflection, yoke, whose, position, may, be, maintained, using, set, screws, a, clamp, and, rubber, wedges, 90, deflection, angle, crts, may, use, self, convergence, without, dynamic, convergence, which, together, with, the, in, line, triad, arrangement, eliminates, the, need, for, separate, convergence, coils, and, related, circuitry, reducing, costs, complexity, and, crt, depth, by, 10, millimeters, self, convergence, works, by, means, of, nonuniform, magnetic, fields, dynamic, convergence, is, necessary, in, 110, deflection, angle, crts, and, quadrupole, windings, on, the, deflection, yoke, at, a, certain, frequency, may, also, be, used, for, dynamic, convergence, dynamic, color, convergence, and, purity, are, one, of, the, main, reasons, why, until, late, in, their, history, crts, were, long, necked, deep, and, had, biaxially, curved, faces, these, geometric, design, characteristics, are, necessary, for, intrinsic, passive, dynamic, color, convergence, and, purity, only, starting, around, the, 1990s, did, sophisticated, active, dynamic, convergence, compensation, circuits, become, available, that, made, short, necked, and, flat, faced, crts, workable, these, active, compensation, circuits, use, the, deflection, yoke, to, finely, adjust, beam, deflection, according, to, the, beam, target, location, the, same, techniques, and, major, circuit, components, also, make, possible, the, adjustment, of, display, image, rotation, skew, and, other, complex, raster, geometry, parameters, through, electronics, under, user, control, alternatively, the, guns, can, be, aligned, with, one, another, converged, using, convergence, rings, placed, right, outside, the, neck, with, one, ring, per, gun, the, rings, can, have, north, and, south, poles, there, can, be, 4, sets, of, rings, one, to, adjust, rgb, convergence, a, second, to, adjust, red, and, blue, convergence, a, third, to, adjust, vertical, raster, shift, and, a, fourth, to, adjust, purity, the, vertical, raster, shift, adjusts, the, straightness, of, the, scan, line, crts, may, also, employ, dynamic, convergence, circuits, which, ensure, correct, convergence, at, the, edges, of, the, crt, permalloy, magnets, may, also, be, used, to, correct, the, convergence, at, the, edges, convergence, is, carried, out, with, the, help, of, a, crosshatch, grid, pattern, other, crts, may, instead, use, magnets, that, are, pushed, in, and, out, instead, of, rings, in, early, color, crts, the, holes, in, the, shadow, mask, became, progressively, smaller, as, they, extended, outwards, from, the, center, of, the, screen, to, aid, in, convergence, if, the, shadow, mask, or, aperture, grille, becomes, magnetized, its, magnetic, field, alters, the, paths, of, the, electron, beams, this, causes, errors, of, color, purity, as, the, electrons, no, longer, follow, only, their, intended, paths, and, some, will, hit, some, phosphors, of, colors, other, than, the, one, intended, for, example, some, electrons, from, the, red, beam, may, hit, blue, or, green, phosphors, imposing, a, magenta, or, yellow, tint, to, parts, of, the, image, that, are, supposed, to, be, pure, red, this, effect, is, localized, to, a, specific, area, of, the, screen, if, the, magnetization, is, localized, therefore, it, is, important, that, the, shadow, mask, or, aperture, grille, not, be, magnetized, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, may, have, an, effect, on, the, color, purity, of, the, crt, because, of, this, some, crts, have, external, magnetic, shields, over, their, funnels, the, magnetic, shield, may, be, made, of, soft, iron, or, mild, steel, and, contain, a, degaussing, coil, the, magnetic, shield, and, shadow, mask, may, be, permanently, magnetized, by, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, adversely, affecting, color, purity, when, the, crt, is, moved, this, problem, is, solved, with, a, built, in, degaussing, coil, found, in, many, tvs, and, computer, monitors, degaussing, may, be, automatic, occurring, whenever, the, crt, is, turned, on, the, magnetic, shield, may, also, be, internal, being, on, the, inside, of, the, funnel, of, the, crt, color, crt, displays, in, tv, sets, and, computer, monitors, often, have, a, built, in, degaussing, demagnetizing, coil, mounted, around, the, perimeter, of, the, crt, face, upon, power, up, of, the, crt, display, the, degaussing, circuit, produces, a, brief, alternating, current, through, the, coil, which, fades, to, zero, over, a, few, seconds, producing, a, decaying, alternating, magnetic, field, from, the, coil, this, degaussing, field, is, strong, enough, to, remove, shadow, mask, magnetization, in, most, cases, maintaining, color, purity, in, unusual, cases, of, strong, magnetization, where, the, internal, degaussing, field, is, not, sufficient, the, shadow, mask, may, be, degaussed, externally, with, a, stronger, portable, degausser, or, demagnetizer, however, an, excessively, strong, magnetic, field, whether, alternating, or, constant, may, mechanically, deform, bend, the, shadow, mask, causing, a, permanent, color, distortion, on, the, display, which, looks, very, similar, to, a, magnetization, effect, dot, pitch, defines, the, maximum, resolution, of, the, display, assuming, delta, gun, crts, in, these, as, the, scanned, resolution, approaches, the, dot, pitch, resolution, moir, appears, as, the, detail, being, displayed, is, finer, than, what, the, shadow, mask, can, render, aperture, grille, monitors, do, not, suffer, from, vertical, moir, however, because, their, phosphor, stripes, have, no, vertical, detail, in, smaller, crts, these, strips, maintain, position, by, themselves, but, larger, aperture, grille, crts, require, one, or, two, crosswise, horizontal, support, strips, one, for, smaller, crts, and, two, for, larger, ones, the, support, wires, block, electrons, causing, the, wires, to, be, visible, in, aperture, grille, crts, dot, pitch, is, replaced, by, stripe, pitch, hitachi, developed, the, enhanced, dot, pitch, edp, shadow, mask, which, uses, oval, holes, instead, of, circular, ones, with, respective, oval, phosphor, dots, moir, is, reduced, in, shadow, mask, crts, by, arranging, the, holes, in, the, shadow, mask, in, a, honeycomb, like, pattern, projection, crts, were, used, in, crt, projectors, and, crt, rear, projection, tvs, and, are, usually, small, being, 7, 9, inches, across, have, a, phosphor, that, generates, either, red, green, or, blue, light, thus, making, them, monochrome, crts, and, are, similar, in, construction, to, other, monochrome, crts, larger, projection, crts, in, general, lasted, longer, and, were, able, to, provide, higher, brightness, levels, and, resolution, but, were, also, more, expensive, projection, crts, have, an, unusually, high, anode, voltage, for, their, size, such, as, 27, or, 25, kv, for, a, 5, or, 7, inch, projection, crt, respectively, and, a, specially, made, tungsten, barium, cathode, instead, of, the, pure, barium, oxide, normally, used, that, consists, of, barium, atoms, embedded, in, 20, porous, tungsten, or, barium, and, calcium, aluminates, or, of, barium, calcium, and, aluminum, oxides, coated, on, porous, tungsten, the, barium, diffuses, through, the, tungsten, to, emit, electrons, the, special, cathode, can, deliver, 2, ma, of, current, instead, of, the, 0, 3ma, of, normal, cathodes, which, makes, them, bright, enough, to, be, used, as, light, sources, for, projection, the, high, anode, voltage, and, the, specially, made, cathode, increase, the, voltage, and, current, respectively, of, the, electron, beam, which, increases, the, light, emitted, by, the, phosphors, and, also, the, amount, of, heat, generated, during, operation, this, means, that, projector, crts, need, cooling, the, screen, is, usually, cooled, using, a, container, the, screen, forms, part, of, the, container, with, glycol, the, glycol, may, itself, be, dyed, or, colorless, glycol, may, be, used, inside, a, container, which, may, be, colored, forming, a, lens, known, as, a, c, element, colored, lenses, or, glycol, are, used, for, improving, color, reproduction, at, the, cost, of, brightness, and, are, only, used, on, red, and, green, crts, each, crt, has, its, own, glycol, which, has, access, to, an, air, bubble, to, allow, the, glycol, to, shrink, and, expand, as, it, cools, and, warms, projector, crts, may, have, adjustment, rings, just, like, color, crts, to, adjust, astigmatism, which, is, flaring, of, the, electron, beam, stray, light, similar, to, shadows, they, have, three, adjustment, rings, one, with, two, poles, one, with, four, poles, and, another, with, 6, poles, when, correctly, adjusted, the, projector, can, display, perfectly, round, dots, without, flaring, the, screens, used, in, projection, crts, were, more, transparent, than, usual, with, 90, transmittance, the, first, projection, crts, were, made, in, 1933, projector, crts, were, available, with, electrostatic, and, electromagnetic, focusing, the, latter, being, more, expensive, electrostatic, focusing, used, electronics, to, focus, the, electron, beam, together, with, focusing, magnets, around, the, neck, of, the, crt, for, fine, focusing, adjustments, this, type, of, focusing, degraded, over, time, electromagnetic, focusing, was, introduced, in, the, early, 1990s, and, included, an, electromagnetic, focusing, coil, in, addition, to, the, already, existing, focusing, magnets, electromagnetic, focusing, was, much, more, stable, over, the, lifetime, of, the, crt, retaining, 95, of, its, sharpness, by, the, end, of, life, of, the, crt, beam, index, tubes, also, known, as, uniray, apple, crt, or, indextron, was, an, attempt, in, the, 1950s, by, philco, to, create, a, color, crt, without, a, shadow, mask, eliminating, convergence, and, purity, problems, and, allowing, for, shallower, crts, with, higher, deflection, angles, it, also, required, a, lower, voltage, power, supply, for, the, final, anode, since, it, did, not, use, a, shadow, mask, which, normally, blocks, around, 80, of, the, electrons, generated, by, the, electron, gun, the, lack, of, a, shadow, mask, also, made, it, immune, to, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, while, also, making, degaussing, unnecessary, and, increasing, image, brightness, it, was, constructed, similarly, to, a, monochrome, crt, with, an, aquadag, outer, coating, an, aluminum, inner, coating, and, a, single, electron, gun, but, with, a, screen, with, an, alternating, pattern, of, red, green, blue, and, uv, index, phosphor, stripes, similarly, to, a, trinitron, with, a, side, mounted, photomultiplier, tube, or, photodiode, pointed, towards, the, rear, of, the, screen, and, mounted, on, the, funnel, of, crt, to, track, the, electron, beam, to, activate, the, phosphors, separately, from, one, another, using, the, same, electron, beam, only, the, index, phosphor, stripe, was, used, for, tracking, and, it, was, the, only, phosphor, that, was, not, covered, by, an, aluminum, layer, it, was, shelved, because, of, the, precision, required, to, produce, it, it, was, revived, by, sony, in, the, 1980s, as, the, indextron, but, its, adoption, was, limited, at, least, in, part, due, to, the, development, of, lcd, displays, beam, index, crts, also, suffered, from, poor, contrast, ratios, of, only, around, 50, 1, since, some, light, emission, by, the, phosphors, was, required, at, all, times, by, the, photodiodes, to, track, the, electron, beam, it, allowed, for, single, crt, color, crt, projectors, due, to, a, lack, of, shadow, mask, normally, crt, projectors, use, three, crts, one, for, each, color, since, a, lot, of, heat, is, generated, due, to, the, high, anode, voltage, and, beam, current, making, a, shadow, mask, impractical, and, inefficient, since, it, would, warp, under, the, heat, produced, shadow, masks, absorb, most, of, the, electron, beam, and, hence, most, of, the, energy, carried, by, the, relativistic, electrons, the, three, crts, meant, that, an, involved, calibration, and, adjustment, procedure, had, to, be, carried, out, during, installation, of, the, projector, and, moving, the, projector, would, require, it, to, be, recalibrated, a, single, crt, meant, the, need, for, calibration, was, eliminated, but, brightness, was, decreased, since, the, crt, screen, had, to, be, used, for, three, colors, instead, of, each, color, having, its, own, crt, screen, a, stripe, pattern, also, imposes, a, horizontal, resolution, limit, in, contrast, three, screen, crt, projectors, have, no, theoretical, resolution, limit, due, to, them, having, single, uniform, phosphor, coatings, flat, crts, are, those, with, a, flat, screen, despite, having, a, flat, screen, they, may, not, be, completely, flat, especially, on, the, inside, instead, having, a, greatly, increased, curvature, a, notable, exception, is, the, lg, flatron, made, by, lg, philips, displays, later, lp, displays, which, is, truly, flat, on, the, outside, and, inside, but, has, a, bonded, glass, pane, on, the, screen, with, a, tensioned, rim, band, to, provide, implosion, protection, such, completely, flat, crts, were, first, introduced, by, zenith, in, 1986, and, used, flat, tensioned, shadow, masks, where, the, shadow, mask, is, held, under, tension, providing, increased, resistance, to, blooming, flat, crts, have, a, number, of, challenges, like, deflection, vertical, deflection, boosters, are, required, to, increase, the, amount, of, current, that, is, sent, to, the, vertical, deflection, coils, to, compensate, for, the, reduced, curvature, the, crts, used, in, the, sinclair, tv80, and, in, many, sony, watchmans, were, flat, in, that, they, were, not, deep, and, their, front, screens, were, flat, but, their, electron, guns, were, put, to, a, side, of, the, screen, the, tv80, used, electrostatic, deflection, while, the, watchman, used, magnetic, deflection, with, a, phosphor, screen, that, was, curved, inwards, similar, crts, were, used, in, video, door, bells, radar, crts, such, as, the, 7jp4, had, a, circular, screen, and, scanned, the, beam, from, the, center, outwards, the, deflection, yoke, rotated, causing, the, beam, to, rotate, in, a, circular, fashion, the, screen, often, had, two, colors, often, a, bright, short, persistence, color, that, only, appeared, as, the, beam, scanned, the, display, and, a, long, persistence, phosphor, afterglow, when, the, beam, strikes, the, phosphor, the, phosphor, brightly, illuminates, and, when, the, beam, leaves, the, dimmer, long, persistence, afterglow, would, remain, lit, where, the, beam, struck, the, phosphor, alongside, the, radar, targets, that, were, written, by, the, beam, until, the, beam, re, struck, the, phosphor, in, oscilloscope, crts, electrostatic, deflection, is, used, rather, than, the, magnetic, deflection, commonly, used, with, tv, and, other, large, crts, the, beam, is, deflected, horizontally, by, applying, an, electric, field, between, a, pair, of, plates, to, its, left, and, right, and, vertically, by, applying, an, electric, field, to, plates, above, and, below, tvs, use, magnetic, rather, than, electrostatic, deflection, because, the, deflection, plates, obstruct, the, beam, when, the, deflection, angle, is, as, large, as, is, required, for, tubes, that, are, relatively, short, for, their, size, some, oscilloscope, crts, incorporate, post, deflection, anodes, pdas, that, are, spiral, shaped, to, ensure, even, anode, potential, across, the, crt, and, operate, at, up, to, 15, kv, in, pda, crts, the, electron, beam, is, deflected, before, it, is, accelerated, improving, sensitivity, and, legibility, specially, when, analyzing, voltage, pulses, with, short, duty, cycles, when, displaying, fast, one, shot, events, the, electron, beam, must, deflect, very, quickly, with, few, electrons, impinging, on, the, screen, leading, to, a, faint, or, invisible, image, on, the, display, oscilloscope, crts, designed, for, very, fast, signals, can, give, a, brighter, display, by, passing, the, electron, beam, through, a, micro, channel, plate, just, before, it, reaches, the, screen, through, the, phenomenon, of, secondary, emission, this, plate, multiplies, the, number, of, electrons, reaching, the, phosphor, screen, giving, a, significant, improvement, in, writing, rate, brightness, and, improved, sensitivity, and, spot, size, as, well, most, oscilloscopes, have, a, graticule, as, part, of, the, visual, display, to, facilitate, measurements, the, graticule, may, be, permanently, marked, inside, the, face, of, the, crt, or, it, may, be, a, transparent, external, plate, made, of, glass, or, acrylic, plastic, an, internal, graticule, eliminates, parallax, error, but, cannot, be, changed, to, accommodate, different, types, of, measurements, oscilloscopes, commonly, provide, a, means, for, the, graticule, to, be, illuminated, from, the, side, which, improves, its, visibility, these, are, found, in, analog, phosphor, storage, oscilloscopes, these, are, distinct, from, digital, storage, oscilloscopes, which, rely, on, solid, state, digital, memory, to, store, the, image, where, a, single, brief, event, is, monitored, by, an, oscilloscope, such, an, event, will, be, displayed, by, a, conventional, tube, only, while, it, actually, occurs, the, use, of, a, long, persistence, phosphor, may, allow, the, image, to, be, observed, after, the, event, but, only, for, a, few, seconds, at, best, this, limitation, can, be, overcome, by, the, use, of, a, direct, view, storage, cathode, ray, tube, storage, tube, a, storage, tube, will, continue, to, display, the, event, after, it, has, occurred, until, such, time, as, it, is, erased, a, storage, tube, is, similar, to, a, conventional, tube, except, that, it, is, equipped, with, a, metal, grid, coated, with, a, dielectric, layer, located, immediately, behind, the, phosphor, screen, an, externally, applied, voltage, to, the, mesh, initially, ensures, that, the, whole, mesh, is, at, a, constant, potential, this, mesh, is, constantly, exposed, to, a, low, velocity, electron, beam, from, a, flood, gun, which, operates, independently, of, the, main, gun, this, flood, gun, is, not, deflected, like, the, main, gun, but, constantly, illuminates, the, whole, of, the, storage, mesh, the, initial, charge, on, the, storage, mesh, is, such, as, to, repel, the, electrons, from, the, flood, gun, which, are, prevented, from, striking, the, phosphor, screen, when, the, main, electron, gun, writes, an, image, to, the, screen, the, energy, in, the, main, beam, is, sufficient, to, create, a, potential, relief, on, the, storage, mesh, the, areas, where, this, relief, is, created, no, longer, repel, the, electrons, from, the, flood, gun, which, now, pass, through, the, mesh, and, illuminate, the, phosphor, screen, consequently, the, image, that, was, briefly, traced, out, by, the, main, gun, continues, to, be, displayed, after, it, has, occurred, the, image, can, be, erased, by, resupplying, the, external, voltage, to, the, mesh, restoring, its, constant, potential, the, time, for, which, the, image, can, be, displayed, was, limited, because, in, practice, the, flood, gun, slowly, neutralises, the, charge, on, the, storage, mesh, one, way, of, allowing, the, image, to, be, retained, for, longer, is, temporarily, to, turn, off, the, flood, gun, it, is, then, possible, for, the, image, to, be, retained, for, several, days, the, majority, of, storage, tubes, allow, for, a, lower, voltage, to, be, applied, to, the, storage, mesh, which, slowly, restores, the, initial, charge, state, by, varying, this, voltage, a, variable, persistence, is, obtained, turning, off, the, flood, gun, and, the, voltage, supply, to, the, storage, mesh, allows, such, a, tube, to, operate, as, a, conventional, oscilloscope, tube, vector, monitors, were, used, in, early, computer, aided, design, systems, and, are, in, some, late, 1970s, to, mid, 1980s, arcade, games, such, as, asteroids, they, draw, graphics, point, to, point, rather, than, scanning, a, raster, either, monochrome, or, color, crts, can, be, used, in, vector, displays, and, the, essential, principles, of, crt, design, and, operation, are, the, same, for, either, type, of, display, the, main, difference, is, in, the, beam, deflection, patterns, and, circuits, the, williams, tube, or, williams, kilburn, tube, was, a, cathode, ray, tube, used, to, electronically, store, binary, data, it, was, used, in, computers, of, the, 1940s, as, a, random, access, digital, storage, device, in, contrast, to, other, crts, in, this, article, the, williams, tube, was, not, a, display, device, and, in, fact, could, not, be, viewed, since, a, metal, plate, covered, its, screen, in, some, vacuum, tube, radio, sets, a, magic, eye, or, tuning, eye, tube, was, provided, to, assist, in, tuning, the, receiver, tuning, would, be, adjusted, until, the, width, of, a, radial, shadow, was, minimized, this, was, used, instead, of, a, more, expensive, electromechanical, meter, which, later, came, to, be, used, on, higher, end, tuners, when, transistor, sets, lacked, the, high, voltage, required, to, drive, the, device, the, same, type, of, device, was, used, with, tape, recorders, as, a, recording, level, meter, and, for, various, other, applications, including, electrical, test, equipment, some, displays, for, early, computers, those, that, needed, to, display, more, text, than, was, practical, using, vectors, or, that, required, high, speed, for, photographic, output, used, charactron, crts, these, incorporate, a, perforated, metal, character, mask, stencil, which, shapes, a, wide, electron, beam, to, form, a, character, on, the, screen, the, system, selects, a, character, on, the, mask, using, one, set, of, deflection, circuits, but, that, causes, the, extruded, beam, to, be, aimed, off, axis, so, a, second, set, of, deflection, plates, has, to, re, aim, the, beam, so, it, is, headed, toward, the, center, of, the, screen, a, third, set, of, plates, places, the, character, wherever, required, the, beam, is, unblanked, turned, on, briefly, to, draw, the, character, at, that, position, graphics, could, be, drawn, by, selecting, the, position, on, the, mask, corresponding, to, the, code, for, a, space, in, practice, they, were, simply, not, drawn, which, had, a, small, round, hole, in, the, center, this, effectively, disabled, the, character, mask, and, the, system, reverted, to, regular, vector, behavior, charactrons, had, exceptionally, long, necks, because, of, the, need, for, three, deflection, systems, nimo, was, the, trademark, of, a, family, of, small, specialised, crts, manufactured, by, industrial, electronic, engineers, these, had, 10, electron, guns, which, produced, electron, beams, in, the, form, of, digits, in, a, manner, similar, to, that, of, the, charactron, the, tubes, were, either, simple, single, digit, displays, or, more, complex, 4, or, 6, digit, displays, produced, by, means, of, a, suitable, magnetic, deflection, system, having, little, of, the, complexities, of, a, standard, crt, the, tube, required, a, relatively, simple, driving, circuit, and, as, the, image, was, projected, on, the, glass, face, it, provided, a, much, wider, viewing, angle, than, competitive, types, e, g, nixie, tubes, however, their, requirement, for, several, voltages, and, their, high, voltage, made, them, uncommon, flood, beam, crts, are, small, tubes, that, are, arranged, as, pixels, for, large, video, walls, like, jumbotrons, the, first, screen, using, this, technology, called, diamond, vision, by, mitsubishi, electric, was, introduced, by, mitsubishi, electric, for, the, 1980, major, league, baseball, all, star, game, it, differs, from, a, normal, crt, in, that, the, electron, gun, within, does, not, produce, a, focused, controllable, beam, instead, electrons, are, sprayed, in, a, wide, cone, across, the, entire, front, of, the, phosphor, screen, basically, making, each, unit, act, as, a, single, light, bulb, each, one, is, coated, with, a, red, green, or, blue, phosphor, to, make, up, the, color, sub, pixels, this, technology, has, largely, been, replaced, with, light, emitting, diode, displays, unfocused, and, undeflected, crts, were, used, as, grid, controlled, stroboscope, lamps, since, 1958, electron, stimulated, luminescence, esl, lamps, which, use, the, same, operating, principle, were, released, in, 2011, crts, with, an, unphosphored, front, glass, but, with, fine, wires, embedded, in, it, were, used, as, electrostatic, print, heads, in, the, 1960s, the, wires, would, pass, the, electron, beam, current, through, the, glass, onto, a, sheet, of, paper, where, the, desired, content, was, therefore, deposited, as, an, electrical, charge, pattern, the, paper, was, then, passed, near, a, pool, of, liquid, ink, with, the, opposite, charge, the, charged, areas, of, the, paper, attract, the, ink, and, thus, form, the, image, in, the, late, 1990s, and, early, 2000s, philips, research, laboratories, experimented, with, a, type, of, thin, crt, known, as, the, zeus, display, which, contained, crt, like, functionality, in, a, flat, panel, display, the, cathode, of, this, display, was, mounted, under, the, front, of, the, display, and, the, electrons, from, the, cathode, would, be, directed, to, the, back, to, the, display, where, they, would, stay, until, extracted, by, electrodes, near, the, front, of, the, display, and, directed, to, the, front, of, the, display, which, had, phosphor, dots, the, devices, were, demonstrated, but, never, marketed, some, crt, manufacturers, both, lg, philips, displays, later, lp, displays, and, samsung, sdi, innovated, crt, technology, by, creating, a, slimmer, tube, slimmer, crt, had, the, trade, names, superslim, ultraslim, vixlim, by, samsung, and, cybertube, and, cybertube, both, by, lg, philips, displays, a, 21, inch, 53, cm, flat, crt, has, a, 447, 2, millimetre, 17, 61, in, depth, the, depth, of, superslim, was, 352, millimetres, 13, 86, in, and, ultraslim, was, 295, 7, millimetres, 11, 64, in, crts, can, emit, a, small, amount, of, x, ray, radiation, this, is, a, result, of, the, electron, beam, s, bombardment, of, the, shadow, mask, aperture, grille, and, phosphors, which, produces, bremsstrahlung, braking, radiation, as, the, high, energy, electrons, are, decelerated, the, amount, of, radiation, escaping, the, front, of, the, monitor, is, widely, considered, to, be, not, harmful, the, food, and, drug, administration, regulations, in, 21, cfr, 1020, 10, are, used, to, strictly, limit, for, instance, tv, receivers, to, 0, 5, milliroentgens, per, hour, at, a, distance, of, 5, cm, 2, in, from, any, external, surface, since, 2007, most, crts, have, emissions, that, fall, well, below, this, limit, note, that, the, roentgen, is, an, outdated, unit, and, does, not, account, for, dose, absorption, the, conversion, rate, is, about, 877, roentgen, per, rem, assuming, that, the, viewer, absorbed, the, entire, dose, which, is, unlikely, and, that, they, watched, tv, for, 2, hours, a, day, a, 5, milliroentgen, hourly, dose, would, increase, the, viewers, yearly, dose, by, 320, millirem, for, comparison, the, average, background, radiation, in, the, united, states, is, 310, millirem, a, year, negative, effects, of, chronic, radiation, are, not, generally, noticeable, until, doses, over, 20, 000, millirem, the, density, of, the, x, rays, that, would, be, generated, by, a, crt, is, low, because, the, raster, scan, of, a, typical, crt, distributes, the, energy, of, the, electron, beam, across, the, entire, screen, voltages, above, 15, 000, volts, are, enough, to, generate, soft, x, rays, however, since, crts, may, stay, on, for, several, hours, at, a, time, the, amount, of, x, rays, generated, by, the, crt, may, become, significant, hence, the, importance, of, using, materials, to, shield, against, x, rays, such, as, the, thick, leaded, glass, and, barium, strontium, glass, used, in, crts, concerns, about, x, rays, emitted, by, crts, began, in, 1967, when, it, was, found, that, tv, sets, made, by, general, electric, were, emitting, x, radiation, in, excess, of, desirable, levels, it, was, later, found, that, tv, sets, from, all, manufacturers, were, also, emitting, radiation, this, caused, tv, industry, representatives, to, be, brought, before, a, u, s, congressional, committee, which, later, proposed, a, federal, radiation, regulation, bill, which, became, the, 1968, radiation, control, for, health, and, safety, act, it, was, recommended, to, tv, set, owners, to, always, be, at, a, distance, of, at, least, 6, feet, from, the, screen, of, the, tv, set, and, to, avoid, prolonged, exposure, at, the, sides, rear, or, underneath, a, tv, set, it, was, discovered, that, most, of, the, radiation, was, directed, downwards, owners, were, also, told, to, not, modify, their, set, s, internals, to, avoid, exposure, to, radiation, headlines, about, radioactive, tv, sets, continued, until, the, end, of, the, 1960s, there, once, was, a, proposal, by, two, new, york, congressmen, that, would, have, forced, tv, set, manufacturers, to, go, into, homes, to, test, all, of, the, nation, s, 15, million, color, sets, and, to, install, radiation, devices, in, them, the, fda, eventually, began, regulating, radiation, emissions, from, all, electronic, products, in, the, us, older, color, and, monochrome, crts, may, have, been, manufactured, with, toxic, substances, such, as, cadmium, in, the, phosphors, the, rear, glass, tube, of, modern, crts, may, be, made, from, leaded, glass, which, represent, an, environmental, hazard, if, disposed, of, improperly, since, 1970, glass, in, the, front, panel, the, viewable, portion, of, the, crt, used, strontium, oxide, rather, than, lead, though, the, rear, of, the, crt, was, still, produced, from, leaded, glass, monochrome, crts, typically, do, not, contain, enough, leaded, glass, to, fail, epa, tclp, tests, while, the, tclp, process, grinds, the, glass, into, fine, particles, in, order, to, expose, them, to, weak, acids, to, test, for, leachate, intact, crt, glass, does, not, leach, the, lead, is, vitrified, contained, inside, the, glass, itself, similar, to, leaded, glass, crystalware, at, low, refresh, rates, 60, hz, and, below, the, periodic, scanning, of, the, display, may, produce, a, flicker, that, some, people, perceive, more, easily, than, others, especially, when, viewed, with, peripheral, vision, flicker, is, commonly, associated, with, crt, as, most, tvs, run, at, 50, hz, pal, or, 60, hz, ntsc, although, there, are, some, 100, hz, pal, tvs, that, are, flicker, free, typically, only, low, end, monitors, run, at, such, low, frequencies, with, most, computer, monitors, supporting, at, least, 75, hz, and, high, end, monitors, capable, of, 100, hz, or, more, to, eliminate, any, perception, of, flicker, though, the, 100, hz, pal, was, often, achieved, using, interleaved, scanning, dividing, the, circuit, and, scan, into, two, beams, of, 50, hz, non, computer, crts, or, crt, for, sonar, or, radar, may, have, long, persistence, phosphor, and, are, thus, flicker, free, if, the, persistence, is, too, long, on, a, video, display, moving, images, will, be, blurred, 50, hz, 60, hz, crts, used, for, tv, operate, with, horizontal, scanning, frequencies, of, 15, 750, and, 15, 734, 27, hz, for, ntsc, systems, or, 15, 625, hz, for, pal, systems, these, frequencies, are, at, the, upper, range, of, human, hearing, and, are, inaudible, to, many, people, however, some, people, especially, children, will, perceive, a, high, pitched, tone, near, an, operating, crt, tv, the, sound, is, due, to, magnetostriction, in, the, magnetic, core, and, periodic, movement, of, windings, of, the, flyback, transformer, but, the, sound, can, also, be, created, by, movement, of, the, deflection, coils, yoke, or, ferrite, beads, this, problem, does, not, occur, on, 100, 120, hz, tvs, and, on, non, cga, color, graphics, adapter, computer, displays, because, they, use, much, higher, horizontal, scanning, frequencies, that, produce, sound, which, is, inaudible, to, humans, 22, khz, to, over, 100, khz, if, the, glass, wall, is, damaged, atmospheric, pressure, can, implode, the, vacuum, tube, into, dangerous, fragments, which, accelerate, inward, and, then, spray, at, high, speed, in, all, directions, although, modern, cathode, ray, tubes, used, in, tvs, and, computer, displays, have, epoxy, bonded, face, plates, or, other, measures, to, prevent, shattering, of, the, envelope, crts, must, be, handled, carefully, to, avoid, injury, early, crts, had, a, glass, plate, over, the, screen, that, was, bonded, to, it, using, glue, creating, a, laminated, glass, screen, initially, the, glue, was, polyvinyl, acetate, pva, while, later, versions, such, as, the, lg, flatron, used, a, resin, perhaps, a, uv, curable, resin, the, pva, degrades, over, time, creating, a, cataract, a, ring, of, degraded, glue, around, the, edges, of, the, crt, that, does, not, allow, light, from, the, screen, to, pass, through, later, crts, instead, use, a, tensioned, metal, rim, band, mounted, around, the, perimeter, that, also, provides, mounting, points, for, the, crt, to, be, mounted, to, a, housing, in, a, 19, inch, crt, the, tensile, stress, in, the, rim, band, is, 70, kg, cm, 2, older, crts, were, mounted, to, the, tv, set, using, a, frame, the, band, is, tensioned, by, heating, it, then, mounting, it, on, the, crt, the, band, cools, afterwards, shrinking, in, size, and, putting, the, glass, under, compression, which, strengthens, the, glass, and, reduces, the, necessary, thickness, and, hence, weight, of, the, glass, this, makes, the, band, an, integral, component, that, should, never, be, removed, from, an, intact, crt, that, still, has, a, vacuum, attempting, to, remove, it, may, cause, the, crt, to, implode, the, rim, band, prevents, the, crt, from, imploding, should, the, screen, be, broken, the, rim, band, may, be, glued, to, the, perimeter, of, the, crt, using, epoxy, preventing, cracks, from, spreading, beyond, the, screen, and, into, the, funnel, alternatively, the, compression, caused, by, the, rim, band, may, be, used, to, cause, any, cracks, in, the, screen, to, propagate, laterally, at, a, high, speed, so, that, they, reach, the, funnel, and, fully, penetrate, it, before, they, fully, penetrate, the, screen, this, is, possible, because, the, funnel, has, walls, that, are, thinner, than, the, screen, fully, penetrating, the, funnel, first, allows, air, to, enter, the, crt, from, a, short, distance, behind, the, screen, and, prevent, an, implosion, by, ensuring, the, screen, is, fully, penetrated, by, the, cracks, and, breaks, only, when, the, crt, already, has, air, to, accelerate, the, electrons, from, the, cathode, to, the, screen, with, enough, energy, to, achieve, sufficient, image, brightness, a, very, high, voltage, eht, or, extra, high, tension, is, required, from, a, few, thousand, volts, for, a, small, oscilloscope, crt, to, tens, of, thousands, for, a, larger, screen, color, tv, this, is, many, times, greater, than, household, power, supply, voltage, even, after, the, power, supply, is, turned, off, some, associated, capacitors, and, the, crt, itself, may, retain, a, charge, for, some, time, and, therefore, dissipate, that, charge, suddenly, through, a, ground, such, as, an, inattentive, human, grounding, a, capacitor, discharge, lead, an, average, monochrome, crt, may, use, 1, 1, 5, kv, of, anode, voltage, per, inch, under, some, circumstances, the, signal, radiated, from, the, electron, guns, scanning, circuitry, and, associated, wiring, of, a, crt, can, be, captured, remotely, and, used, to, reconstruct, what, is, shown, on, the, crt, using, a, process, called, van, eck, phreaking, special, tempest, shielding, can, mitigate, this, effect, such, radiation, of, a, potentially, exploitable, signal, however, occurs, also, with, other, display, technologies, and, with, electronics, in, general, due, to, the, toxins, contained, in, crt, monitors, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, created, rules, in, october, 2001, stating, that, crts, must, be, brought, to, special, e, waste, recycling, facilities, in, november, 2002, the, epa, began, fining, companies, that, disposed, of, crts, through, landfills, or, incineration, regulatory, agencies, local, and, statewide, monitor, the, disposal, of, crts, and, other, computer, equipment, as, electronic, waste, crts, are, considered, one, of, the, hardest, types, to, recycle, crts, have, relatively, high, concentration, of, lead, and, phosphors, both, of, which, are, necessary, for, the, display, there, are, several, companies, in, the, united, states, that, charge, a, small, fee, to, collect, crts, then, subsidize, their, labor, by, selling, the, harvested, copper, wire, and, printed, circuit, boards, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, includes, discarded, crt, monitors, in, its, category, of, hazardous, household, waste, but, considers, crts,
