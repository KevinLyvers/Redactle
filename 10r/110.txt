a, programming, language, is, a, system, of, notation, for, writing, computer, programs, programming, languages, are, described, in, terms, of, their, syntax, form, and, semantics, meaning, usually, defined, by, a, formal, language, languages, usually, provide, features, such, as, a, type, system, variables, and, mechanisms, for, error, handling, an, implementation, of, a, programming, language, is, required, in, order, to, execute, programs, namely, an, interpreter, or, a, compiler, an, interpreter, directly, executes, the, source, code, while, a, compiler, produces, an, executable, program, computer, architecture, has, strongly, influenced, the, design, of, programming, languages, with, the, most, common, type, imperative, languages, which, implement, operations, in, a, specified, order, developed, to, perform, well, on, the, popular, von, neumann, architecture, while, early, programming, languages, were, closely, tied, to, the, hardware, over, time, they, have, developed, more, abstraction, to, hide, implementation, details, for, greater, simplicity, thousands, of, programming, languages, often, classified, as, imperative, functional, logic, or, object, oriented, have, been, developed, for, a, wide, variety, of, uses, many, aspects, of, programming, language, design, involve, tradeoffs, for, example, exception, handling, simplifies, error, handling, but, at, a, performance, cost, programming, language, theory, is, the, subfield, of, computer, science, that, studies, the, design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and, classification, of, programming, languages, there, are, a, variety, of, criteria, that, may, be, considered, when, defining, what, constitutes, a, programming, language, the, term, computer, language, is, sometimes, used, interchangeably, with, programming, language, however, the, usage, of, both, terms, varies, among, authors, including, the, exact, scope, of, each, one, usage, describes, programming, languages, as, a, subset, of, computer, languages, similarly, languages, used, in, computing, that, have, a, different, goal, than, expressing, computer, programs, are, generically, designated, computer, languages, for, instance, markup, languages, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, computer, languages, to, emphasize, that, they, are, not, meant, to, be, used, for, programming, one, way, of, classifying, computer, languages, is, by, the, computations, they, are, capable, of, expressing, as, described, by, the, theory, of, computation, the, majority, of, practical, programming, languages, are, turing, complete, and, all, turing, complete, languages, can, implement, the, same, set, of, algorithms, ansi, iso, sql, 92, and, charity, are, examples, of, languages, that, are, not, turing, complete, yet, are, often, called, programming, languages, however, some, authors, restrict, the, term, programming, language, to, turing, complete, languages, another, usage, regards, programming, languages, as, theoretical, constructs, for, programming, abstract, machines, and, computer, languages, as, the, subset, thereof, that, runs, on, physical, computers, which, have, finite, hardware, resources, john, c, reynolds, emphasizes, that, formal, specification, languages, are, just, as, much, programming, languages, as, are, the, languages, intended, for, execution, he, also, argues, that, textual, and, even, graphical, input, formats, that, affect, the, behavior, of, a, computer, are, programming, languages, despite, the, fact, they, are, commonly, not, turing, complete, and, remarks, that, ignorance, of, programming, language, concepts, is, the, reason, for, many, flaws, in, input, formats, in, most, practical, contexts, a, programming, language, involves, a, computer, consequently, programming, languages, are, usually, defined, and, studied, this, way, programming, languages, differ, from, natural, languages, in, that, natural, languages, are, only, used, for, interaction, between, people, while, programming, languages, also, allow, humans, to, communicate, instructions, to, machines, the, domain, of, the, language, is, also, worth, consideration, markup, languages, like, xml, html, or, troff, which, define, structured, data, are, not, usually, considered, programming, languages, programming, languages, may, however, share, the, syntax, with, markup, languages, if, a, computational, semantics, is, defined, xslt, for, example, is, a, turing, complete, language, entirely, using, xml, syntax, moreover, latex, which, is, mostly, used, for, structuring, documents, also, contains, a, turing, complete, subset, programming, languages, usually, contain, abstractions, for, defining, and, manipulating, data, structures, or, controlling, the, flow, of, execution, the, practical, necessity, that, a, programming, language, supports, adequate, abstractions, is, expressed, by, the, abstraction, principle, this, principle, is, sometimes, formulated, as, a, recommendation, to, the, programmer, to, make, proper, use, of, such, abstractions, the, first, programmable, computers, were, invented, at, the, end, of, the, 1940s, and, with, them, the, first, programming, languages, the, earliest, computers, were, programmed, in, first, generation, programming, languages, 1gls, machine, language, simple, instructions, that, could, be, directly, executed, by, the, processor, this, code, was, very, difficult, to, debug, and, was, not, portable, between, different, computer, systems, in, order, to, improve, the, ease, of, programming, assembly, languages, or, second, generation, programming, languages, 2gls, were, invented, diverging, from, the, machine, language, to, make, programs, easier, to, understand, for, humans, although, they, did, not, increase, portability, initially, hardware, resources, were, scarce, and, expensive, while, human, resources, were, cheaper, therefore, cumbersome, languages, that, were, time, consuming, to, use, but, were, closer, to, the, hardware, for, higher, efficiency, were, favored, the, introduction, of, high, level, programming, languages, third, generation, programming, languages, 3gls, revolutionized, programming, these, languages, abstracted, away, the, details, of, the, hardware, instead, being, designed, to, express, algorithms, that, could, be, understood, more, easily, by, humans, for, example, arithmetic, expressions, could, now, be, written, in, symbolic, notation, and, later, translated, into, machine, code, that, the, hardware, could, execute, in, 1957, fortran, formula, translation, was, invented, often, considered, the, first, compiled, high, level, programming, language, fortran, has, remained, in, use, into, the, twenty, first, century, around, 1960, the, first, mainframes, general, purpose, computers, were, developed, although, they, could, only, be, operated, by, professionals, and, the, cost, was, extreme, the, data, and, instructions, were, input, by, punch, cards, meaning, that, no, input, could, be, added, while, the, program, was, running, the, languages, developed, at, this, time, therefore, are, designed, for, minimal, interaction, after, the, invention, of, the, microprocessor, computers, in, the, 1970s, became, dramatically, cheaper, new, computers, also, allowed, more, user, interaction, which, was, supported, by, newer, programming, languages, lisp, implemented, in, 1958, was, the, first, functional, programming, language, unlike, fortran, it, supports, recursion, and, conditional, expressions, and, it, also, introduced, dynamic, memory, management, on, a, heap, and, automatic, garbage, collection, for, the, next, decades, lisp, dominated, artificial, intelligence, applications, in, 1978, another, functional, language, ml, introduced, inferred, types, and, polymorphic, parameters, after, algol, algorithmic, language, was, released, in, 1958, and, 1960, it, became, the, standard, in, computing, literature, for, describing, algorithms, although, its, commercial, success, was, limited, most, popular, imperative, languages, including, c, pascal, ada, c, java, and, c, are, directly, or, indirectly, descended, from, algol, 60, among, its, innovations, adopted, by, later, programming, languages, included, greater, portability, and, the, first, use, of, context, free, bnf, grammar, simula, the, first, language, to, support, object, oriented, programming, including, subtypes, dynamic, dispatch, and, inheritance, also, descends, from, algol, and, achieved, commercial, success, c, another, algol, descendant, has, sustained, popularity, into, the, twenty, first, century, c, allows, access, to, lower, level, machine, operations, more, than, other, contemporary, languages, its, power, and, efficiency, generated, in, part, with, flexible, pointer, operations, comes, at, the, cost, of, making, it, more, difficult, to, write, correct, code, prolog, designed, in, 1972, was, the, first, logic, programming, language, communicating, with, a, computer, using, formal, logic, notation, with, logic, programming, the, programmer, specifies, a, desired, result, and, allows, the, interpreter, to, decide, how, to, achieve, it, during, the, 1980s, the, invention, of, the, personal, computer, transformed, the, roles, for, which, programming, languages, were, used, new, languages, introduced, in, the, 1980s, included, c, a, superset, of, c, that, can, compile, c, programs, but, also, supports, classes, and, inheritance, ada, and, other, new, languages, introduced, support, for, concurrency, the, japanese, government, invested, heavily, into, the, so, called, fifth, generation, languages, that, added, support, for, concurrency, to, logic, programming, constructs, but, these, languages, were, outperformed, by, other, concurrency, supporting, languages, due, to, the, rapid, growth, of, the, internet, and, the, world, wide, web, in, the, 1990s, new, programming, languages, were, introduced, to, support, web, pages, and, networking, java, based, on, c, and, designed, for, increased, portability, across, systems, and, security, enjoyed, large, scale, success, because, these, features, are, essential, for, many, internet, applications, another, development, was, that, of, dynamically, typed, scripting, languages, python, javascript, php, and, ruby, designed, to, quickly, produce, small, programs, that, coordinate, existing, applications, due, to, their, integration, with, html, they, have, also, been, used, for, building, web, pages, hosted, on, servers, during, the, 2000s, there, was, a, slowdown, in, the, development, of, new, programming, languages, that, achieved, widespread, popularity, one, innovation, was, service, oriented, programming, designed, to, exploit, distributed, systems, whose, components, are, connected, by, a, network, services, are, similar, to, objects, in, object, oriented, programming, but, run, on, a, separate, process, c, and, f, cross, pollinated, ideas, between, imperative, and, functional, programming, after, 2010, several, new, languages, rust, go, swift, zig, and, carbon, competed, for, the, performance, critical, software, for, which, c, had, historically, been, used, most, of, the, new, programming, languages, uses, static, typing, while, a, few, numbers, of, new, languages, use, dynamic, typing, like, ring, and, julia, some, of, the, new, programming, languages, are, classified, as, visual, programming, languages, vpl, like, scratch, labview, and, pwct, also, some, of, these, languages, mix, between, textual, and, visual, programming, usage, like, ballerina, also, this, trend, lead, to, developing, projects, that, help, in, developing, new, vpls, like, blockly, by, google, many, game, engines, like, unreal, and, unity, added, support, for, visual, scripting, too, every, programming, language, includes, fundamental, elements, for, describing, data, and, the, operations, or, transformations, applied, to, them, such, as, adding, two, numbers, or, selecting, an, item, from, a, collection, these, elements, are, governed, by, syntactic, and, semantic, rules, that, define, their, structure, and, meaning, respectively, a, programming, language, s, surface, form, is, known, as, its, syntax, most, programming, languages, are, purely, textual, they, use, sequences, of, text, including, words, numbers, and, punctuation, much, like, written, natural, languages, on, the, other, hand, some, programming, languages, are, graphical, using, visual, relationships, between, symbols, to, specify, a, program, the, syntax, of, a, language, describes, the, possible, combinations, of, symbols, that, form, a, syntactically, correct, program, the, meaning, given, to, a, combination, of, symbols, is, handled, by, semantics, either, formal, or, hard, coded, in, a, reference, implementation, since, most, languages, are, textual, this, article, discusses, textual, syntax, the, programming, language, syntax, is, usually, defined, using, a, combination, of, regular, expressions, for, lexical, structure, and, backus, naur, form, for, grammatical, structure, below, is, a, simple, grammar, based, on, lisp, this, grammar, specifies, the, following, the, following, are, examples, of, well, formed, token, sequences, in, this, grammar, 12345, and, a, b, c232, 1, not, all, syntactically, correct, programs, are, semantically, correct, many, syntactically, correct, programs, are, nonetheless, ill, formed, per, the, language, s, rules, and, may, depending, on, the, language, specification, and, the, soundness, of, the, implementation, result, in, an, error, on, translation, or, execution, in, some, cases, such, programs, may, exhibit, undefined, behavior, even, when, a, program, is, well, defined, within, a, language, it, may, still, have, a, meaning, that, is, not, intended, by, the, person, who, wrote, it, using, natural, language, as, an, example, it, may, not, be, possible, to, assign, a, meaning, to, a, grammatically, correct, sentence, or, the, sentence, may, be, false, the, following, c, language, fragment, is, syntactically, correct, but, performs, operations, that, are, not, semantically, defined, the, operation, p, 4, has, no, meaning, for, a, value, having, a, complex, type, and, p, im, is, not, defined, because, the, value, of, p, is, the, null, pointer, if, the, type, declaration, on, the, first, line, were, omitted, the, program, would, trigger, an, error, on, the, undefined, variable, p, during, compilation, however, the, program, would, still, be, syntactically, correct, since, type, declarations, provide, only, semantic, information, the, grammar, needed, to, specify, a, programming, language, can, be, classified, by, its, position, in, the, chomsky, hierarchy, the, syntax, of, most, programming, languages, can, be, specified, using, a, type, 2, grammar, i, e, they, are, context, free, grammars, some, languages, including, perl, and, lisp, contain, constructs, that, allow, execution, during, the, parsing, phase, languages, that, have, constructs, that, allow, the, programmer, to, alter, the, behavior, of, the, parser, make, syntax, analysis, an, undecidable, problem, and, generally, blur, the, distinction, between, parsing, and, execution, in, contrast, to, lisp, s, macro, system, and, perl, s, begin, blocks, which, may, contain, general, computations, c, macros, are, merely, string, replacements, and, do, not, require, code, execution, the, term, semantics, refers, to, the, meaning, of, languages, as, opposed, to, their, form, syntax, static, semantics, defines, restrictions, on, the, structure, of, valid, texts, that, are, hard, or, impossible, to, express, in, standard, syntactic, formalisms, for, compiled, languages, static, semantics, essentially, include, those, semantic, rules, that, can, be, checked, at, compile, time, examples, include, checking, that, every, identifier, is, declared, before, it, is, used, in, languages, that, require, such, declarations, or, that, the, labels, on, the, arms, of, a, case, statement, are, distinct, many, important, restrictions, of, this, type, like, checking, that, identifiers, are, used, in, the, appropriate, context, e, g, not, adding, an, integer, to, a, function, name, or, that, subroutine, calls, have, the, appropriate, number, and, type, of, arguments, can, be, enforced, by, defining, them, as, rules, in, a, logic, called, a, type, system, other, forms, of, static, analyses, like, data, flow, analysis, may, also, be, part, of, static, semantics, programming, languages, such, as, java, and, c, have, definite, assignment, analysis, a, form, of, data, flow, analysis, as, part, of, their, respective, static, semantics, once, data, has, been, specified, the, machine, must, be, instructed, to, perform, operations, on, the, data, for, example, the, semantics, may, define, the, strategy, by, which, expressions, are, evaluated, to, values, or, the, manner, in, which, control, structures, conditionally, execute, statements, the, dynamic, semantics, also, known, as, execution, semantics, of, a, language, defines, how, and, when, the, various, constructs, of, a, language, should, produce, a, program, behavior, there, are, many, ways, of, defining, execution, semantics, natural, language, is, often, used, to, specify, the, execution, semantics, of, languages, commonly, used, in, practice, a, significant, amount, of, academic, research, goes, into, formal, semantics, of, programming, languages, which, allows, execution, semantics, to, be, specified, in, a, formal, manner, results, from, this, field, of, research, have, seen, limited, application, to, programming, language, design, and, implementation, outside, academia, a, data, type, is, a, set, of, allowable, values, and, operations, that, can, be, performed, on, these, values, each, programming, language, s, type, system, defines, which, data, types, exist, the, type, of, an, expression, and, how, type, equivalence, and, type, compatibility, function, in, the, language, according, to, type, theory, a, language, is, fully, typed, if, the, specification, of, every, operation, defines, types, of, data, to, which, the, operation, is, applicable, in, contrast, an, untyped, language, such, as, most, assembly, languages, allows, any, operation, to, be, performed, on, any, data, generally, sequences, of, bits, of, various, lengths, in, practice, while, few, languages, are, fully, typed, most, offer, a, degree, of, typing, because, different, types, such, as, integers, and, floats, represent, values, differently, unexpected, results, will, occur, if, one, type, is, used, when, another, is, expected, type, checking, will, flag, this, error, usually, at, compile, time, runtime, type, checking, is, more, costly, with, strong, typing, type, errors, can, always, be, detected, unless, variables, are, explicitly, cast, to, a, different, type, weak, typing, occurs, when, languages, allow, implicit, casting, for, example, to, enable, operations, between, variables, of, different, types, without, the, programmer, making, an, explicit, type, conversion, the, more, cases, in, which, this, type, coercion, is, allowed, the, fewer, type, errors, can, be, detected, early, programming, languages, often, supported, only, built, in, numeric, types, such, as, the, integer, signed, and, unsigned, and, floating, point, to, support, operations, on, real, numbers, that, are, not, integers, most, programming, languages, support, multiple, sizes, of, floats, often, called, float, and, double, and, integers, depending, on, the, size, and, precision, required, by, the, programmer, storing, an, integer, in, a, type, that, is, too, small, to, represent, it, leads, to, integer, overflow, the, most, common, way, of, representing, negative, numbers, with, signed, types, is, twos, complement, although, ones, complement, is, also, used, other, common, types, include, boolean, which, is, either, true, or, false, and, character, traditionally, one, byte, sufficient, to, represent, all, ascii, characters, arrays, are, a, data, type, whose, elements, in, many, languages, must, consist, of, a, single, type, of, fixed, length, other, languages, define, arrays, as, references, to, data, stored, elsewhere, and, support, elements, of, varying, types, depending, on, the, programming, language, sequences, of, multiple, characters, called, strings, may, be, supported, as, arrays, of, characters, or, their, own, primitive, type, strings, may, be, of, fixed, or, variable, length, which, enables, greater, flexibility, at, the, cost, of, increased, storage, space, and, more, complexity, other, data, types, that, may, be, supported, include, lists, associative, unordered, arrays, accessed, via, keys, records, in, which, data, is, mapped, to, names, in, an, ordered, structure, and, tuples, similar, to, records, but, without, names, for, data, fields, pointers, store, memory, addresses, typically, referencing, locations, on, the, heap, where, other, data, is, stored, the, simplest, user, defined, type, is, an, ordinal, type, whose, values, can, be, mapped, onto, the, set, of, positive, integers, since, the, mid, 1980s, most, programming, languages, also, support, abstract, data, types, in, which, the, representation, of, the, data, and, operations, are, hidden, from, the, user, who, can, only, access, an, interface, the, benefits, of, data, abstraction, can, include, increased, reliability, reduced, complexity, less, potential, for, name, collision, and, allowing, the, underlying, data, structure, to, be, changed, without, the, client, needing, to, alter, its, code, in, static, typing, all, expressions, have, their, types, determined, before, a, program, executes, typically, at, compile, time, most, widely, used, statically, typed, programming, languages, require, the, types, of, variables, to, be, specified, explicitly, in, some, languages, types, are, implicit, one, form, of, this, is, when, the, compiler, can, infer, types, based, on, context, the, downside, of, implicit, typing, is, the, potential, for, errors, to, go, undetected, complete, type, inference, has, traditionally, been, associated, with, functional, languages, such, as, haskell, and, ml, with, dynamic, typing, the, type, is, not, attached, to, the, variable, but, only, the, value, encoded, in, it, a, single, variable, can, be, reused, for, a, value, of, a, different, type, although, this, provides, more, flexibility, to, the, programmer, it, is, at, the, cost, of, lower, reliability, and, less, ability, for, the, programming, language, to, check, for, errors, some, languages, allow, variables, of, a, union, type, to, which, any, type, of, value, can, be, assigned, in, an, exception, to, their, usual, static, typing, rules, in, computing, multiple, instructions, can, be, executed, simultaneously, many, programming, languages, support, instruction, level, and, subprogram, level, concurrency, by, the, twenty, first, century, additional, processing, power, on, computers, was, increasingly, coming, from, the, use, of, additional, processors, which, requires, programmers, to, design, software, that, makes, use, of, multiple, processors, simultaneously, to, achieve, improved, performance, interpreted, languages, such, as, python, and, ruby, do, not, support, the, concurrent, use, of, multiple, processors, other, programming, languages, do, support, managing, data, shared, between, different, threads, by, controlling, the, order, of, execution, of, key, instructions, via, the, use, of, semaphores, controlling, access, to, shared, data, via, monitor, or, enabling, message, passing, between, threads, many, programming, languages, include, exception, handlers, a, section, of, code, triggered, by, runtime, errors, that, can, deal, with, them, in, two, main, ways, some, programming, languages, support, dedicating, a, block, of, code, to, run, regardless, of, whether, an, exception, occurs, before, the, code, is, reached, this, is, called, finalization, there, is, a, tradeoff, between, increased, ability, to, handle, exceptions, and, reduced, performance, for, example, even, though, array, index, errors, are, common, c, does, not, check, them, for, performance, reasons, although, programmers, can, write, code, to, catch, user, defined, exceptions, this, can, clutter, a, program, standard, libraries, in, some, languages, such, as, c, use, their, return, values, to, indicate, an, exception, some, languages, and, their, compilers, have, the, option, of, turning, on, and, off, error, handling, capability, either, temporarily, or, permanently, one, of, the, most, important, influences, on, programming, language, design, has, been, computer, architecture, imperative, languages, the, most, commonly, used, type, were, designed, to, perform, well, on, von, neumann, architecture, the, most, common, computer, architecture, in, von, neumann, architecture, the, memory, stores, both, data, and, instructions, while, the, cpu, that, performs, instructions, on, data, is, separate, and, data, must, be, piped, back, and, forth, to, the, cpu, the, central, elements, in, these, languages, are, variables, assignment, and, iteration, which, is, more, efficient, than, recursion, on, these, machines, many, programming, languages, have, been, designed, from, scratch, altered, to, meet, new, needs, and, combined, with, other, languages, many, have, eventually, fallen, into, disuse, the, birth, of, programming, languages, in, the, 1950s, was, stimulated, by, the, desire, to, make, a, universal, programming, language, suitable, for, all, machines, and, uses, avoiding, the, need, to, write, code, for, different, computers, by, the, early, 1960s, the, idea, of, a, universal, language, was, rejected, due, to, the, differing, requirements, of, the, variety, of, purposes, for, which, code, was, written, desirable, qualities, of, programming, languages, include, readability, writability, and, reliability, these, features, can, reduce, the, cost, of, training, programmers, in, a, language, the, amount, of, time, needed, to, write, and, maintain, programs, in, the, language, the, cost, of, compiling, the, code, and, increase, runtime, performance, programming, language, design, often, involves, tradeoffs, for, example, features, to, improve, reliability, typically, come, at, the, cost, of, performance, increased, expressivity, due, to, a, large, number, of, operators, makes, writing, code, easier, but, comes, at, the, cost, of, readability, natural, language, programming, has, been, proposed, as, a, way, to, eliminate, the, need, for, a, specialized, language, for, programming, however, this, goal, remains, distant, and, its, benefits, are, open, to, debate, edsger, w, dijkstra, took, the, position, that, the, use, of, a, formal, language, is, essential, to, prevent, the, introduction, of, meaningless, constructs, alan, perlis, was, similarly, dismissive, of, the, idea, the, specification, of, a, programming, language, is, an, artifact, that, the, language, users, and, the, implementors, can, use, to, agree, upon, whether, a, piece, of, source, code, is, a, valid, program, in, that, language, and, if, so, what, its, behavior, shall, be, a, programming, language, specification, can, take, several, forms, including, the, following, an, implementation, of, a, programming, language, is, the, conversion, of, a, program, into, machine, code, that, can, be, executed, by, the, hardware, the, machine, code, then, can, be, executed, with, the, help, of, the, operating, system, the, most, common, form, of, interpretation, in, production, code, is, by, a, compiler, which, translates, the, source, code, via, an, intermediate, level, language, into, machine, code, known, as, an, executable, once, the, program, is, compiled, it, will, run, more, quickly, than, with, other, implementation, methods, some, compilers, are, able, to, provide, further, optimization, to, reduce, memory, or, computation, usage, when, the, executable, runs, but, increasing, compilation, time, another, implementation, method, is, to, run, the, program, with, an, interpreter, which, translates, each, line, of, software, into, machine, code, just, before, it, executes, although, it, can, make, debugging, easier, the, downside, of, interpretation, is, that, it, runs, 10, to, 100, times, slower, than, a, compiled, executable, hybrid, interpretation, methods, provide, some, of, the, benefits, of, compilation, and, some, of, the, benefits, of, interpretation, via, partial, compilation, one, form, this, takes, is, just, in, time, compilation, in, which, the, software, is, compiled, ahead, of, time, into, an, intermediate, language, and, then, into, machine, code, immediately, before, execution, although, most, of, the, most, commonly, used, programming, languages, have, fully, open, specifications, and, implementations, many, programming, languages, exist, only, as, proprietary, programming, languages, with, the, implementation, available, only, from, a, single, vendor, which, may, claim, that, such, a, proprietary, language, is, their, intellectual, property, proprietary, programming, languages, are, commonly, domain, specific, languages, or, internal, scripting, languages, for, a, single, product, some, proprietary, languages, are, used, only, internally, within, a, vendor, while, others, are, available, to, external, users, some, programming, languages, exist, on, the, border, between, proprietary, and, open, for, example, oracle, corporation, asserts, proprietary, rights, to, some, aspects, of, the, java, programming, language, and, microsoft, s, c, programming, language, which, has, open, implementations, of, most, parts, of, the, system, also, has, common, language, runtime, clr, as, a, closed, environment, many, proprietary, languages, are, widely, used, in, spite, of, their, proprietary, nature, examples, include, matlab, vbscript, and, wolfram, language, some, languages, may, make, the, transition, from, closed, to, open, for, example, erlang, was, originally, ericsson, s, internal, programming, language, open, source, programming, languages, are, particularly, helpful, for, open, science, applications, enhancing, the, capacity, for, replication, and, code, sharing, thousands, of, different, programming, languages, have, been, created, mainly, in, the, computing, field, individual, software, projects, commonly, use, five, programming, languages, or, more, programming, languages, differ, from, most, other, forms, of, human, expression, in, that, they, require, a, greater, degree, of, precision, and, completeness, when, using, a, natural, language, to, communicate, with, other, people, human, authors, and, speakers, can, be, ambiguous, and, make, small, errors, and, still, expect, their, intent, to, be, understood, however, figuratively, speaking, computers, do, exactly, what, they, are, told, to, do, and, cannot, understand, what, code, the, programmer, intended, to, write, the, combination, of, the, language, definition, a, program, and, the, program, s, inputs, must, fully, specify, the, external, behavior, that, occurs, when, the, program, is, executed, within, the, domain, of, control, of, that, program, on, the, other, hand, ideas, about, an, algorithm, can, be, communicated, to, humans, without, the, precision, required, for, execution, by, using, pseudocode, which, interleaves, natural, language, with, code, written, in, a, programming, language, a, programming, language, provides, a, structured, mechanism, for, defining, pieces, of, data, and, the, operations, or, transformations, that, may, be, carried, out, automatically, on, that, data, a, programmer, uses, the, abstractions, present, in, the, language, to, represent, the, concepts, involved, in, a, computation, these, concepts, are, represented, as, a, collection, of, the, simplest, elements, available, called, primitives, programming, is, the, process, by, which, programmers, combine, these, primitives, to, compose, new, programs, or, adapt, existing, ones, to, new, uses, or, a, changing, environment, programs, for, a, computer, might, be, executed, in, a, batch, process, without, human, interaction, or, a, user, might, type, commands, in, an, interactive, session, of, an, interpreter, in, this, case, the, commands, are, simply, programs, whose, execution, is, chained, together, when, a, language, can, run, its, commands, through, an, interpreter, such, as, a, unix, shell, or, other, command, line, interface, without, compiling, it, is, called, a, scripting, language, determining, which, is, the, most, widely, used, programming, language, is, difficult, since, the, definition, of, usage, varies, by, context, one, language, may, occupy, the, greater, number, of, programmer, hours, a, different, one, has, more, lines, of, code, and, a, third, may, consume, the, most, cpu, time, some, languages, are, very, popular, for, particular, kinds, of, applications, for, example, cobol, is, still, strong, in, the, corporate, data, center, often, on, large, mainframes, fortran, in, scientific, and, engineering, applications, ada, in, aerospace, transportation, military, real, time, and, embedded, applications, and, c, in, embedded, applications, and, operating, systems, other, languages, are, regularly, used, to, write, many, different, kinds, of, applications, various, methods, of, measuring, language, popularity, each, subject, to, a, different, bias, over, what, is, measured, have, been, proposed, combining, and, averaging, information, from, various, internet, sites, stackify, com, reported, the, ten, most, popular, programming, languages, in, descending, order, by, overall, popularity, java, c, c, python, c, javascript, vb, net, r, php, and, matlab, as, of, june, 2024, the, top, five, programming, languages, as, measured, by, tiobe, index, are, python, c, c, java, and, c, tiobe, provide, a, list, of, top, 100, programming, languages, according, to, popularity, and, update, this, list, every, month, a, dialect, of, a, programming, language, or, a, data, exchange, language, is, a, relatively, small, variation, or, extension, of, the, language, that, does, not, change, its, intrinsic, nature, with, languages, such, as, scheme, and, forth, standards, may, be, considered, insufficient, inadequate, or, illegitimate, by, implementors, so, often, they, will, deviate, from, the, standard, making, a, new, dialect, in, other, cases, a, dialect, is, created, for, use, in, a, domain, specific, language, often, a, subset, in, the, lisp, world, most, languages, that, use, basic, s, expression, syntax, and, lisp, like, semantics, are, considered, lisp, dialects, although, they, vary, wildly, as, do, say, racket, and, clojure, as, it, is, common, for, one, language, to, have, several, dialects, it, can, become, quite, difficult, for, an, inexperienced, programmer, to, find, the, right, documentation, the, basic, language, has, many, dialects, programming, languages, are, often, placed, into, four, main, categories, imperative, functional, logic, and, object, oriented, although, markup, languages, are, not, programming, languages, some, have, extensions, that, support, limited, programming, additionally, there, are, special, purpose, languages, that, are, not, easily, compared, to, other, programming, languages
