a, loudspeaker, commonly, referred, to, as, a, speaker, or, more, fully, a, speaker, system, is, a, combination, of, one, or, more, speaker, drivers, an, enclosure, and, electrical, connections, possibly, including, a, crossover, network, the, speaker, driver, is, an, electroacoustic, transducer, 597, that, converts, an, electrical, audio, signal, into, a, corresponding, sound, the, driver, can, be, viewed, as, a, linear, motor, attached, to, a, diaphragm, which, couples, that, motor, s, movement, to, motion, of, air, that, is, sound, an, audio, signal, typically, from, a, microphone, recording, or, radio, broadcast, is, amplified, electronically, to, a, power, level, capable, of, driving, that, motor, in, order, to, reproduce, the, sound, corresponding, to, the, original, unamplified, electronic, signal, this, is, thus, the, opposite, function, to, the, microphone, indeed, the, dynamic, speaker, driver, by, far, the, most, common, type, is, a, linear, motor, in, the, same, basic, configuration, as, the, dynamic, microphone, which, uses, such, a, motor, in, reverse, as, a, generator, the, dynamic, speaker, was, invented, in, 1925, by, edward, w, kellogg, and, chester, w, rice, when, the, electrical, current, from, an, audio, signal, passes, through, its, voice, coil, a, coil, of, wire, capable, of, moving, axially, in, a, cylindrical, gap, containing, a, concentrated, magnetic, field, produced, by, a, permanent, magnet, the, coil, is, forced, to, move, rapidly, back, and, forth, due, to, faraday, s, law, of, induction, this, attaches, to, a, diaphragm, or, speaker, cone, as, it, is, usually, conically, shaped, for, sturdiness, in, contact, with, air, thus, creating, sound, waves, in, addition, to, dynamic, speakers, several, other, technologies, are, possible, for, creating, sound, from, an, electrical, signal, a, few, of, which, are, in, commercial, use, in, order, for, a, speaker, to, efficiently, produce, sound, especially, at, lower, frequencies, the, speaker, driver, must, be, baffled, so, that, the, sound, emanating, from, its, rear, does, not, cancel, out, the, intended, sound, from, the, front, this, generally, takes, the, form, of, a, speaker, enclosure, or, speaker, cabinet, an, often, rectangular, box, made, of, wood, but, sometimes, metal, or, plastic, the, enclosure, s, design, plays, an, important, acoustic, role, thus, determining, the, resulting, sound, quality, most, high, fidelity, speaker, systems, picture, at, right, include, two, or, more, sorts, of, speaker, drivers, each, specialized, in, one, part, of, the, audible, frequency, range, the, smaller, drivers, capable, of, reproducing, the, highest, audio, frequencies, are, called, tweeters, those, for, middle, frequencies, are, called, mid, range, drivers, and, those, for, low, frequencies, are, called, woofers, sometimes, the, reproduction, of, the, very, lowest, frequencies, 20, 50, hz, is, augmented, by, a, so, called, subwoofer, often, in, its, own, large, enclosure, in, a, two, way, or, three, way, speaker, system, one, with, drivers, covering, two, or, three, different, frequency, ranges, there, is, a, small, amount, of, passive, electronics, called, a, crossover, network, which, helps, direct, components, of, the, electronic, signal, to, the, speaker, drivers, best, capable, of, reproducing, those, frequencies, in, a, so, called, powered, speaker, system, the, power, amplifier, actually, feeding, the, speaker, drivers, is, built, into, the, enclosure, itself, these, have, become, more, and, more, common, especially, as, computer, speakers, smaller, speakers, are, found, in, devices, such, as, radios, televisions, portable, audio, players, personal, computers, computer, speakers, headphones, and, earphones, larger, louder, speaker, systems, are, used, for, home, hi, fi, systems, stereos, electronic, musical, instruments, sound, reinforcement, in, theaters, and, concert, halls, and, in, public, address, systems, the, term, loudspeaker, may, refer, to, individual, transducers, also, known, as, drivers, or, to, complete, speaker, systems, consisting, of, an, enclosure, and, one, or, more, drivers, to, adequately, and, accurately, reproduce, a, wide, range, of, frequencies, with, even, coverage, most, loudspeaker, systems, employ, more, than, one, driver, particularly, for, higher, sound, pressure, level, spl, or, maximum, accuracy, individual, drivers, are, used, to, reproduce, different, frequency, ranges, the, drivers, are, named, subwoofers, for, very, low, frequencies, woofers, low, frequencies, mid, range, speakers, middle, frequencies, tweeters, high, frequencies, and, sometimes, supertweeters, for, the, highest, audible, frequencies, and, beyond, the, terms, for, different, speaker, drivers, differ, depending, on, the, application, in, two, way, systems, there, is, no, mid, range, driver, so, the, task, of, reproducing, the, mid, range, sounds, is, divided, between, the, woofer, and, tweeter, when, multiple, drivers, are, used, in, a, system, a, filter, network, called, an, audio, crossover, separates, the, incoming, signal, into, different, frequency, ranges, and, routes, them, to, the, appropriate, driver, a, loudspeaker, system, with, n, separate, frequency, bands, is, described, as, n, way, speakers, a, two, way, system, will, have, a, woofer, and, a, tweeter, a, three, way, system, employs, a, woofer, a, mid, range, and, a, tweeter, loudspeaker, drivers, of, the, type, pictured, are, termed, dynamic, short, for, electrodynamic, to, distinguish, them, from, other, sorts, including, moving, iron, speakers, and, speakers, using, piezoelectric, or, electrostatic, systems, johann, philipp, reis, installed, an, electric, loudspeaker, in, his, telephone, in, 1861, it, was, capable, of, reproducing, clear, tones, but, later, revisions, could, also, reproduce, muffled, speech, alexander, graham, bell, patented, his, first, electric, loudspeaker, a, moving, iron, type, capable, of, reproducing, intelligible, speech, as, part, of, his, telephone, in, 1876, which, was, followed, in, 1877, by, an, improved, version, from, ernst, siemens, during, this, time, thomas, edison, was, issued, a, british, patent, for, a, system, using, compressed, air, as, an, amplifying, mechanism, for, his, early, cylinder, phonographs, but, he, ultimately, settled, for, the, familiar, metal, horn, driven, by, a, membrane, attached, to, the, stylus, in, 1898, horace, short, patented, a, design, for, a, loudspeaker, driven, by, compressed, air, he, then, sold, the, rights, to, charles, parsons, who, was, issued, several, additional, british, patents, before, 1910, a, few, companies, including, the, victor, talking, machine, company, and, path, produced, record, players, using, compressed, air, loudspeakers, compressed, air, designs, are, significantly, limited, by, their, poor, sound, quality, and, their, inability, to, reproduce, sound, at, low, volume, variants, of, the, design, were, used, for, public, address, applications, and, more, recently, other, variations, have, been, used, to, test, space, equipment, resistance, to, the, very, loud, sound, and, vibration, levels, that, the, launching, of, rockets, produces, the, first, experimental, moving, coil, also, called, dynamic, loudspeaker, was, invented, by, oliver, lodge, in, 1898, the, first, practical, moving, coil, loudspeakers, were, manufactured, by, danish, engineer, peter, l, jensen, and, edwin, pridham, in, 1915, in, napa, california, like, previous, loudspeakers, these, used, horns, to, amplify, the, sound, produced, by, a, small, diaphragm, jensen, was, denied, patents, being, unsuccessful, in, selling, their, product, to, telephone, companies, in, 1915, they, changed, their, target, market, to, radios, and, public, address, systems, and, named, their, product, magnavox, jensen, was, for, years, after, the, invention, of, the, loudspeaker, a, part, owner, of, the, magnavox, company, the, moving, coil, principle, commonly, used, today, in, speakers, was, patented, in, 1925, by, edward, w, kellogg, and, chester, w, rice, the, key, difference, between, previous, attempts, and, the, patent, by, rice, and, kellogg, is, the, adjustment, of, mechanical, parameters, to, provide, a, reasonably, flat, frequency, response, these, first, loudspeakers, used, electromagnets, because, large, powerful, permanent, magnets, were, generally, not, available, at, a, reasonable, price, the, coil, of, an, electromagnet, called, a, field, coil, was, energized, by, a, current, through, a, second, pair, of, connections, to, the, driver, this, winding, usually, served, a, dual, role, acting, also, as, a, choke, coil, filtering, the, power, supply, of, the, amplifier, that, the, loudspeaker, was, connected, to, ac, ripple, in, the, current, was, attenuated, by, the, action, of, passing, through, the, choke, coil, however, ac, line, frequencies, tended, to, modulate, the, audio, signal, going, to, the, voice, coil, and, added, to, the, audible, hum, in, 1930, jensen, introduced, the, first, commercial, fixed, magnet, loudspeaker, however, the, large, heavy, iron, magnets, of, the, day, were, impractical, and, field, coil, speakers, remained, predominant, until, the, widespread, availability, of, lightweight, alnico, magnets, after, world, war, ii, in, the, 1930s, loudspeaker, manufacturers, began, to, combine, two, and, three, drivers, or, sets, of, drivers, each, optimized, for, a, different, frequency, range, in, order, to, improve, frequency, response, and, increase, sound, pressure, level, in, 1937, the, first, film, industry, standard, loudspeaker, system, the, shearer, horn, system, for, theatres, a, two, way, system, was, introduced, by, metro, goldwyn, mayer, it, used, four, 15, low, frequency, drivers, a, crossover, network, set, for, 375, hz, and, a, single, multi, cellular, horn, with, two, compression, drivers, providing, the, high, frequencies, john, kenneth, hilliard, james, bullough, lansing, and, douglas, shearer, all, played, roles, in, creating, the, system, at, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, a, very, large, two, way, public, address, system, was, mounted, on, a, tower, at, flushing, meadows, the, eight, 27, low, frequency, drivers, were, designed, by, rudy, bozak, in, his, role, as, chief, engineer, for, cinaudagraph, high, frequency, drivers, were, likely, made, by, western, electric, altec, lansing, introduced, the, 604, which, became, their, most, famous, coaxial, duplex, driver, in, 1943, it, incorporated, a, high, frequency, horn, that, sent, sound, through, a, hole, in, the, pole, piece, of, a, 15, inch, woofer, for, near, point, source, performance, altec, s, voice, of, the, theatre, loudspeaker, system, was, first, sold, in, 1945, offering, better, coherence, and, clarity, at, the, high, output, levels, necessary, in, movie, theaters, the, academy, of, motion, picture, arts, and, sciences, immediately, began, testing, its, sonic, characteristics, they, made, it, the, film, house, industry, standard, in, 1955, in, 1954, edgar, villchur, developed, the, acoustic, suspension, principle, of, loudspeaker, design, this, allowed, for, better, bass, response, than, previously, obtainable, from, drivers, mounted, in, larger, cabinets, he, and, his, partner, henry, kloss, formed, the, acoustic, research, company, to, manufacture, and, market, speaker, systems, using, this, principle, subsequently, continuous, developments, in, enclosure, design, and, materials, led, to, significant, audible, improvements, the, most, notable, improvements, to, date, in, modern, dynamic, drivers, and, the, loudspeakers, that, employ, them, are, improvements, in, cone, materials, the, introduction, of, higher, temperature, adhesives, improved, permanent, magnet, materials, improved, measurement, techniques, computer, aided, design, and, finite, element, analysis, at, low, frequencies, thiele, small, parameters, electrical, network, theory, has, been, used, to, optimize, bass, driver, and, enclosure, synergy, since, the, early, 1970s, the, most, common, type, of, driver, commonly, called, a, dynamic, loudspeaker, uses, a, lightweight, diaphragm, or, cone, connected, to, a, rigid, basket, or, frame, via, a, flexible, suspension, commonly, called, a, spider, that, constrains, a, voice, coil, to, move, axially, through, a, cylindrical, magnetic, gap, a, protective, dust, cap, glued, in, the, cone, s, center, prevents, dust, most, importantly, ferromagnetic, debris, from, entering, the, gap, when, an, electrical, signal, is, applied, to, the, voice, coil, a, magnetic, field, is, created, by, the, electric, current, in, the, voice, coil, making, it, a, variable, electromagnet, the, coil, and, the, driver, s, magnetic, system, interact, in, a, manner, similar, to, a, solenoid, generating, a, mechanical, force, that, moves, the, coil, and, thus, the, attached, cone, application, of, alternating, current, moves, the, cone, back, and, forth, accelerating, and, reproducing, sound, under, the, control, of, the, applied, electrical, signal, coming, from, the, amplifier, the, following, is, a, description, of, the, individual, components, of, this, type, of, loudspeaker, the, diaphragm, is, usually, manufactured, with, a, cone, or, dome, shaped, profile, a, variety, of, different, materials, may, be, used, but, the, most, common, are, paper, plastic, and, metal, the, ideal, material, is, rigid, to, prevent, uncontrolled, cone, motions, has, low, mass, to, minimize, starting, force, requirements, and, energy, storage, issues, and, is, well, damped, to, reduce, vibrations, continuing, after, the, signal, has, stopped, with, little, or, no, audible, ringing, due, to, its, resonance, frequency, as, determined, by, its, usage, in, practice, all, three, of, these, criteria, cannot, be, met, simultaneously, using, existing, materials, thus, driver, design, involves, trade, offs, for, example, paper, is, light, and, typically, well, damped, but, is, not, stiff, metal, may, be, stiff, and, light, but, it, usually, has, poor, damping, plastic, can, be, light, but, typically, the, stiffer, it, is, made, the, poorer, the, damping, as, a, result, many, cones, are, made, of, some, sort, of, composite, material, for, example, a, cone, might, be, made, of, cellulose, paper, into, which, some, carbon, fiber, kevlar, glass, hemp, or, bamboo, fibers, have, been, added, or, it, might, use, a, honeycomb, sandwich, construction, or, a, coating, might, be, applied, to, it, so, as, to, provide, additional, stiffening, or, damping, the, chassis, frame, or, basket, is, designed, to, be, rigid, preventing, deformation, that, could, change, critical, alignments, with, the, magnet, gap, perhaps, allowing, the, voice, coil, to, rub, against, the, magnet, around, the, gap, chassis, are, typically, cast, from, aluminum, alloy, in, heavier, magnet, structure, speakers, or, stamped, from, thin, sheet, steel, in, lighter, structure, drivers, other, materials, such, as, molded, plastic, and, damped, plastic, compound, baskets, are, becoming, common, especially, for, inexpensive, low, mass, drivers, a, metallic, chassis, can, play, an, important, role, in, conducting, heat, away, from, the, voice, coil, heating, during, operation, changes, resistance, causes, physical, dimensional, changes, and, if, extreme, broils, the, varnish, on, the, voice, coil, it, may, even, demagnetize, permanent, magnets, the, suspension, system, keeps, the, coil, centered, in, the, gap, and, provides, a, restoring, centering, force, that, returns, the, cone, to, a, neutral, position, after, moving, a, typical, suspension, system, consists, of, two, parts, the, spider, which, connects, the, diaphragm, or, voice, coil, to, the, lower, frame, and, provides, the, majority, of, the, restoring, force, and, the, surround, which, helps, center, the, coil, cone, assembly, and, allows, free, pistonic, motion, aligned, with, the, magnetic, gap, the, spider, is, usually, made, of, a, corrugated, fabric, disk, impregnated, with, a, stiffening, resin, the, name, comes, from, the, shape, of, early, suspensions, which, were, two, concentric, rings, of, bakelite, material, joined, by, six, or, eight, curved, legs, variations, of, this, topology, included, the, addition, of, a, felt, disc, to, provide, a, barrier, to, particles, that, might, otherwise, cause, the, voice, coil, to, rub, the, cone, surround, can, be, rubber, or, polyester, foam, treated, paper, or, a, ring, of, corrugated, resin, coated, fabric, it, is, attached, to, both, the, outer, cone, circumference, and, to, the, upper, frame, these, diverse, surround, materials, their, shape, and, treatment, can, dramatically, affect, the, acoustic, output, of, a, driver, each, implementation, has, advantages, and, disadvantages, polyester, foam, for, example, is, lightweight, and, economical, though, usually, leaks, air, to, some, degree, and, is, degraded, by, time, exposure, to, ozone, uv, light, humidity, and, elevated, temperatures, limiting, useful, life, before, failure, the, wire, in, a, voice, coil, is, usually, made, of, copper, though, aluminum, and, rarely, silver, may, be, used, the, advantage, of, aluminum, is, its, light, weight, which, reduces, the, moving, mass, compared, to, copper, this, raises, the, resonant, frequency, of, the, speaker, and, increases, its, efficiency, a, disadvantage, of, aluminum, is, that, it, is, not, easily, soldered, and, so, connections, must, be, robustly, crimped, together, and, sealed, voice, coil, wire, cross, sections, can, be, circular, rectangular, or, hexagonal, giving, varying, amounts, of, wire, volume, coverage, in, the, magnetic, gap, space, the, coil, is, oriented, co, axially, inside, the, gap, it, moves, back, and, forth, within, a, small, circular, volume, a, hole, slot, or, groove, in, the, magnetic, structure, the, gap, establishes, a, concentrated, magnetic, field, between, the, two, poles, of, a, permanent, magnet, the, outside, ring, of, the, gap, is, one, pole, and, the, center, post, called, the, pole, piece, is, the, other, the, pole, piece, and, backplate, are, often, made, as, a, single, piece, called, the, poleplate, or, yoke, the, size, and, type, of, magnet, and, details, of, the, magnetic, circuit, differ, depending, on, design, goals, for, instance, the, shape, of, the, pole, piece, affects, the, magnetic, interaction, between, the, voice, coil, and, the, magnetic, field, and, is, sometimes, used, to, modify, a, driver, s, behavior, a, shorting, ring, or, faraday, loop, may, be, included, as, a, thin, copper, cap, fitted, over, the, pole, tip, or, as, a, heavy, ring, situated, within, the, magnet, pole, cavity, the, benefits, of, this, complication, is, reduced, impedance, at, high, frequencies, providing, extended, treble, output, reduced, harmonic, distortion, and, a, reduction, in, the, inductance, modulation, that, typically, accompanies, large, voice, coil, excursions, on, the, other, hand, the, copper, cap, requires, a, wider, voice, coil, gap, with, increased, magnetic, reluctance, this, reduces, available, flux, requiring, a, larger, magnet, for, equivalent, performance, electromagnets, were, often, used, in, musical, instrument, amplifiers, cabinets, well, into, the, 1950s, there, were, economic, savings, in, those, using, tube, amplifiers, as, the, field, coil, could, and, usually, did, do, double, duty, as, a, power, supply, choke, very, few, manufacturers, still, produce, electrodynamic, loudspeakers, with, electrically, powered, field, coils, as, was, common, in, the, earliest, designs, speaker, system, design, involves, subjective, perceptions, of, timbre, and, sound, quality, measurements, and, experiments, adjusting, a, design, to, improve, performance, is, done, using, a, combination, of, magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and, materials, science, theory, and, tracked, with, high, precision, measurements, and, the, observations, of, experienced, listeners, a, few, of, the, issues, speaker, and, driver, designers, must, confront, are, distortion, acoustic, lobing, phase, effects, off, axis, response, and, crossover, artifacts, designers, can, use, an, anechoic, chamber, to, ensure, the, speaker, can, be, measured, independently, of, room, effects, or, any, of, several, electronic, techniques, that, to, some, extent, substitute, for, such, chambers, some, developers, eschew, anechoic, chambers, in, favor, of, specific, standardized, room, setups, intended, to, simulate, real, life, listening, conditions, individual, electrodynamic, drivers, provide, their, best, performance, within, a, limited, frequency, range, multiple, drivers, e, g, subwoofers, woofers, mid, range, drivers, and, tweeters, are, generally, combined, into, a, complete, loudspeaker, system, to, provide, performance, beyond, that, constraint, the, three, most, commonly, used, sound, radiation, systems, are, the, cone, dome, and, horn, type, drivers, a, full, or, wide, range, driver, is, a, speaker, driver, designed, to, be, used, alone, to, reproduce, an, audio, channel, without, the, help, of, other, drivers, and, therefore, must, cover, the, audio, frequency, range, required, by, the, application, these, drivers, are, small, typically, 3, to, 8, inches, 7, 6, to, 20, 3, cm, in, diameter, to, permit, reasonable, high, frequency, response, and, carefully, designed, to, give, low, distortion, output, at, low, frequencies, though, with, reduced, maximum, output, level, full, range, drivers, are, found, for, instance, in, public, address, systems, in, televisions, small, radios, intercoms, and, some, computer, speakers, in, hi, fi, speaker, systems, the, use, of, wide, range, drivers, can, avoid, undesirable, interactions, between, multiple, drivers, caused, by, non, coincident, driver, location, or, crossover, network, issues, but, also, may, limit, frequency, response, and, output, abilities, most, especially, at, low, frequencies, hi, fi, speaker, systems, built, with, wide, range, drivers, may, require, large, elaborate, or, expensive, enclosures, to, approach, optimum, performance, full, range, drivers, often, employ, an, additional, cone, called, a, whizzer, a, small, light, cone, attached, to, the, joint, between, the, voice, coil, and, the, primary, cone, the, whizzer, cone, extends, the, high, frequency, response, of, the, driver, and, broadens, its, high, frequency, directivity, which, would, otherwise, be, greatly, narrowed, due, to, the, outer, diameter, cone, material, failing, to, keep, up, with, the, central, voice, coil, at, higher, frequencies, the, main, cone, in, a, whizzer, design, is, manufactured, so, as, to, flex, more, in, the, outer, diameter, than, in, the, center, the, result, is, that, the, main, cone, delivers, low, frequencies, and, the, whizzer, cone, contributes, most, of, the, higher, frequencies, since, the, whizzer, cone, is, smaller, than, the, main, diaphragm, output, dispersion, at, high, frequencies, is, improved, relative, to, an, equivalent, single, larger, diaphragm, limited, range, drivers, also, used, alone, are, typically, found, in, computers, toys, and, clock, radios, these, drivers, are, less, elaborate, and, less, expensive, than, wide, range, drivers, and, they, may, be, severely, compromised, to, fit, into, very, small, mounting, locations, in, these, applications, sound, quality, is, a, low, priority, a, subwoofer, is, a, woofer, driver, used, only, for, the, lowest, pitched, part, of, the, audio, spectrum, typically, below, 200, hz, for, consumer, systems, below, 100, hz, for, professional, live, sound, and, below, 80, hz, in, thx, approved, systems, because, the, intended, range, of, frequencies, is, limited, subwoofer, system, design, is, usually, simpler, in, many, respects, than, for, conventional, loudspeakers, often, consisting, of, a, single, driver, enclosed, in, a, suitable, enclosure, since, sound, in, this, frequency, range, can, easily, bend, around, corners, by, diffraction, the, speaker, aperture, does, not, have, to, face, the, audience, and, subwoofers, can, be, mounted, in, the, bottom, of, the, enclosure, facing, the, floor, this, is, eased, by, the, limitations, of, human, hearing, at, low, frequencies, such, sounds, cannot, be, located, in, space, due, to, their, large, wavelengths, compared, to, higher, frequencies, which, produce, differential, effects, in, the, ears, due, to, shadowing, by, the, head, and, diffraction, around, it, both, of, which, we, rely, upon, for, localization, clues, to, accurately, reproduce, very, low, bass, notes, subwoofer, systems, must, be, solidly, constructed, and, properly, braced, to, avoid, unwanted, sounds, from, cabinet, vibrations, as, a, result, good, subwoofers, are, typically, quite, heavy, many, subwoofer, systems, include, integrated, power, amplifiers, and, electronic, subsonic, filters, with, additional, controls, relevant, to, low, frequency, reproduction, e, g, a, crossover, knob, and, a, phase, switch, these, variants, are, known, as, active, or, powered, subwoofers, in, contrast, passive, subwoofers, require, external, amplification, in, typical, installations, subwoofers, are, physically, separated, from, the, rest, of, the, speaker, cabinets, because, of, propagation, delay, and, positioning, their, output, may, be, out, of, phase, with, the, rest, of, the, sound, consequently, a, subwoofer, s, power, amp, often, has, a, phase, delay, adjustment, which, may, be, used, improve, performance, of, the, system, as, a, whole, subwoofers, are, widely, used, in, large, concert, and, mid, sized, venue, sound, reinforcement, systems, subwoofer, cabinets, are, often, built, with, a, bass, reflex, port, a, design, feature, which, if, properly, engineered, improves, bass, performance, and, increases, efficiency, a, woofer, is, a, driver, that, reproduces, low, frequencies, the, driver, works, with, the, characteristics, of, the, speaker, enclosure, to, produce, suitable, low, frequencies, some, loudspeaker, systems, use, a, woofer, for, the, lowest, frequencies, sometimes, well, enough, that, a, subwoofer, is, not, needed, additionally, some, loudspeakers, use, the, woofer, to, handle, middle, frequencies, eliminating, the, mid, range, driver, a, mid, range, speaker, is, a, loudspeaker, driver, that, reproduces, a, band, of, frequencies, generally, between, 1, 6, khz, otherwise, known, as, the, mid, frequencies, between, the, woofer, and, tweeter, mid, range, driver, diaphragms, can, be, made, of, paper, or, composite, materials, and, can, be, direct, radiation, drivers, rather, like, smaller, woofers, or, they, can, be, compression, drivers, rather, like, some, tweeter, designs, if, the, mid, range, driver, is, a, direct, radiator, it, can, be, mounted, on, the, front, baffle, of, a, loudspeaker, enclosure, or, if, a, compression, driver, mounted, at, the, throat, of, a, horn, for, added, output, level, and, control, of, radiation, pattern, a, tweeter, is, a, high, frequency, driver, that, reproduces, the, highest, frequencies, in, a, speaker, system, a, major, problem, in, tweeter, design, is, achieving, wide, angular, sound, coverage, off, axis, response, since, high, frequency, sound, tends, to, leave, the, speaker, in, narrow, beams, soft, dome, tweeters, are, widely, found, in, home, stereo, systems, and, horn, loaded, compression, drivers, are, common, in, professional, sound, reinforcement, ribbon, tweeters, have, gained, popularity, as, the, output, power, of, some, designs, has, been, increased, to, levels, useful, for, professional, sound, reinforcement, and, their, output, pattern, is, wide, in, the, horizontal, plane, a, pattern, that, has, convenient, applications, in, concert, sound, a, coaxial, driver, is, a, loudspeaker, driver, with, two, or, more, combined, concentric, drivers, coaxial, drivers, have, been, produced, by, altec, tannoy, pioneer, kef, seas, b, c, speakers, bms, cabasse, and, genelec, used, in, multi, driver, speaker, systems, the, crossover, is, an, assembly, of, filters, that, separate, the, input, signal, into, different, frequency, bands, according, to, the, requirements, of, each, driver, hence, the, drivers, receive, power, only, in, the, sound, frequency, range, they, were, designed, for, thereby, reducing, distortion, in, the, drivers, and, interference, between, them, crossovers, can, be, passive, or, active, a, passive, crossover, is, an, electronic, circuit, that, uses, a, combination, of, one, or, more, resistors, inductors, and, capacitors, these, components, are, combined, to, form, a, filter, network, and, are, most, often, placed, between, the, full, frequency, range, power, amplifier, and, the, loudspeaker, drivers, to, divide, the, amplifier, s, signal, into, the, necessary, frequency, bands, before, being, delivered, to, the, individual, drivers, passive, crossover, circuits, need, no, external, power, beyond, the, audio, signal, itself, but, have, some, disadvantages, they, may, require, larger, inductors, and, capacitors, due, to, power, handling, requirements, unlike, active, crossovers, which, include, a, built, in, amplifier, passive, crossovers, have, an, inherent, attenuation, within, the, passband, typically, leading, to, a, reduction, in, damping, factor, before, the, voice, coil, an, active, crossover, is, an, electronic, filter, circuit, that, divides, the, signal, into, individual, frequency, bands, before, power, amplification, thus, requiring, at, least, one, power, amplifier, for, each, band, passive, filtering, may, also, be, used, in, this, way, before, power, amplification, but, it, is, an, uncommon, solution, being, less, flexible, than, active, filtering, any, technique, that, uses, crossover, filtering, followed, by, amplification, is, commonly, known, as, bi, amping, tri, amping, quad, amping, and, so, on, depending, on, the, minimum, number, of, amplifier, channels, some, loudspeaker, designs, use, a, combination, of, passive, and, active, crossover, filtering, such, as, a, passive, crossover, between, the, mid, and, high, frequency, drivers, and, an, active, crossover, for, the, low, frequency, driver, passive, crossovers, are, commonly, installed, inside, speaker, boxes, and, are, by, far, the, most, common, type, of, crossover, for, home, and, low, power, use, in, car, audio, systems, passive, crossovers, may, be, in, a, separate, box, necessary, to, accommodate, the, size, of, the, components, used, passive, crossovers, may, be, simple, for, low, order, filtering, or, complex, to, allow, steep, slopes, such, as, 18, or, 24, db, per, octave, passive, crossovers, can, also, be, designed, to, compensate, for, undesired, characteristics, of, driver, horn, or, enclosure, resonances, and, can, be, tricky, to, implement, due, to, component, interaction, passive, crossovers, like, the, driver, units, that, they, feed, have, power, handling, limits, have, insertion, losses, and, change, the, load, seen, by, the, amplifier, the, changes, are, matters, of, concern, for, many, in, the, hi, fi, world, when, high, output, levels, are, required, active, crossovers, may, be, preferable, active, crossovers, may, be, simple, circuits, that, emulate, the, response, of, a, passive, network, or, may, be, more, complex, allowing, extensive, audio, adjustments, some, active, crossovers, usually, digital, loudspeaker, management, systems, may, include, electronics, and, controls, for, precise, alignment, of, phase, and, time, between, frequency, bands, equalization, dynamic, range, compression, and, limiting, most, loudspeaker, systems, consist, of, drivers, mounted, in, an, enclosure, or, cabinet, the, role, of, the, enclosure, is, to, prevent, sound, waves, emanating, from, the, back, of, a, driver, from, interfering, destructively, with, those, from, the, front, the, sound, waves, emitted, from, the, back, are, 180, out, of, phase, with, those, emitted, forward, so, without, an, enclosure, they, typically, cause, cancellations, which, significantly, degrade, the, level, and, quality, of, sound, at, low, frequencies, the, simplest, driver, mount, is, a, flat, panel, baffle, with, the, drivers, mounted, in, holes, in, it, however, in, this, approach, sound, frequencies, with, a, wavelength, longer, than, the, baffle, dimensions, are, canceled, out, because, the, antiphase, radiation, from, the, rear, of, the, cone, interferes, with, the, radiation, from, the, front, with, an, infinitely, large, panel, this, interference, could, be, entirely, prevented, a, sufficiently, large, sealed, box, can, approach, this, behavior, since, panels, of, infinite, dimensions, are, impossible, most, enclosures, function, by, containing, the, rear, radiation, from, the, moving, diaphragm, a, sealed, enclosure, prevents, transmission, of, the, sound, emitted, from, the, rear, of, the, loudspeaker, by, confining, the, sound, in, a, rigid, and, airtight, box, techniques, used, to, reduce, the, transmission, of, sound, through, the, walls, of, the, cabinet, include, thicker, cabinet, walls, internal, bracing, and, lossy, wall, material, however, a, rigid, enclosure, reflects, sound, internally, which, can, then, be, transmitted, back, through, the, loudspeaker, diaphragm, again, resulting, in, degradation, of, sound, quality, this, can, be, reduced, by, internal, absorption, using, absorptive, materials, such, as, glass, wool, wool, or, synthetic, fiber, batting, within, the, enclosure, the, internal, shape, of, the, enclosure, can, also, be, designed, to, reduce, this, by, reflecting, sounds, away, from, the, loudspeaker, diaphragm, where, they, may, then, be, absorbed, other, enclosure, types, alter, the, rear, sound, radiation, so, it, can, add, constructively, to, the, output, from, the, front, of, the, cone, designs, that, do, this, including, bass, reflex, passive, radiator, transmission, line, etc, are, often, used, to, extend, the, effective, low, frequency, response, and, increase, the, low, frequency, output, of, the, driver, to, make, the, transition, between, drivers, as, seamless, as, possible, system, designers, have, attempted, to, time, align, the, drivers, by, moving, one, or, more, driver, mounting, locations, forward, or, back, so, that, the, acoustic, center, of, each, driver, is, in, the, same, vertical, plane, this, may, also, involve, tilting, the, driver, back, providing, a, separate, enclosure, mounting, for, each, driver, or, using, electronic, techniques, to, achieve, the, same, effect, these, attempts, have, resulted, in, some, unusual, cabinet, designs, the, speaker, mounting, scheme, including, cabinets, can, also, cause, diffraction, resulting, in, peaks, and, dips, in, the, frequency, response, the, problem, is, usually, greatest, at, higher, frequencies, where, wavelengths, are, similar, to, or, smaller, than, cabinet, dimensions, horn, loudspeakers, are, the, oldest, form, of, loudspeaker, system, the, use, of, horns, as, voice, amplifying, megaphones, dates, at, least, to, the, 17th, century, and, horns, were, used, in, mechanical, gramophones, as, early, as, 1877, horn, loudspeakers, use, a, shaped, waveguide, in, front, of, or, behind, the, driver, to, increase, the, directivity, of, the, loudspeaker, and, to, transform, a, small, diameter, high, pressure, condition, at, the, driver, cone, surface, to, a, large, diameter, low, pressure, condition, at, the, mouth, of, the, horn, this, improves, the, acoustic, electro, mechanical, impedance, match, between, the, driver, and, ambient, air, increasing, efficiency, and, focusing, the, sound, over, a, narrower, area, the, size, of, the, throat, mouth, the, length, of, the, horn, as, well, as, the, area, expansion, rate, along, it, must, be, carefully, chosen, to, match, the, driver, to, properly, provide, this, transforming, function, over, a, range, of, frequencies, the, length, and, cross, sectional, mouth, area, required, to, create, a, bass, or, sub, bass, horn, dictates, a, horn, many, feet, long, folded, horns, can, reduce, the, total, size, but, compel, designers, to, make, compromises, and, accept, increased, cost, and, construction, complications, some, horn, designs, not, only, fold, the, low, frequency, horn, but, use, the, walls, in, a, room, corner, as, an, extension, of, the, horn, mouth, in, the, late, 1940s, horns, whose, mouths, took, up, much, of, a, room, wall, were, not, unknown, among, hi, fi, fans, room, sized, installations, became, much, less, acceptable, when, two, or, more, were, required, a, horn, loaded, speaker, can, have, a, sensitivity, as, high, as, 110, db, at, 2, 83, volts, 1, watt, at, 8, ohms, at, 1, meter, this, is, a, hundredfold, increase, in, output, compared, to, a, speaker, rated, at, 90, db, sensitivity, and, is, invaluable, in, applications, where, high, sound, levels, are, required, or, amplifier, power, is, limited, a, transmission, line, loudspeaker, is, a, loudspeaker, enclosure, design, that, uses, an, acoustic, transmission, line, within, the, cabinet, compared, to, the, simpler, enclosure, based, designs, instead, of, reverberating, in, a, fairly, simple, damped, enclosure, sound, from, the, back, of, the, bass, speaker, is, directed, into, a, long, generally, folded, damped, pathway, within, the, speaker, enclosure, which, allows, greater, control, and, efficient, use, of, speaker, energy, most, home, hi, fi, loudspeakers, use, two, wiring, points, to, connect, to, the, source, of, the, signal, for, example, to, the, audio, amplifier, or, receiver, to, accept, the, wire, connection, the, loudspeaker, enclosure, may, have, binding, posts, spring, clips, or, a, panel, mount, jack, if, the, wires, for, a, pair, of, speakers, are, not, connected, with, respect, to, the, proper, electrical, polarity, the, loudspeakers, are, said, to, be, out, of, phase, or, more, properly, out, of, polarity, given, identical, signals, motion, in, the, cone, of, an, out, of, polarity, loudspeaker, is, in, the, opposite, direction, of, the, others, this, typically, causes, monophonic, material, in, a, stereo, recording, to, be, canceled, out, reduced, in, level, and, made, more, difficult, to, localize, all, due, to, destructive, interference, of, the, sound, waves, the, cancellation, effect, is, most, noticeable, at, frequencies, where, the, loudspeakers, are, separated, by, a, quarter, wavelength, or, less, low, frequencies, are, affected, the, most, this, type, of, miswiring, error, does, not, damage, speakers, but, is, not, optimal, for, listening, with, sound, reinforcement, system, pa, system, and, instrument, amplifier, speaker, enclosures, cables, and, some, type, of, jack, or, connector, are, typically, used, lower, and, mid, priced, sound, system, and, instrument, speaker, cabinets, often, use, 1, 4, jacks, higher, priced, and, higher, powered, sound, system, cabinets, and, instrument, speaker, cabinets, often, use, speakon, connectors, speakon, connectors, are, considered, to, be, safer, for, high, wattage, amplifiers, because, the, connector, is, designed, so, that, human, users, cannot, touch, the, connectors, wireless, speakers, are, similar, to, wired, powered, speakers, but, they, receive, audio, signals, using, radio, frequency, rf, waves, rather, than, over, audio, cables, there, is, an, amplifier, integrated, in, the, speaker, s, cabinet, because, the, rf, waves, alone, are, not, enough, to, drive, the, speaker, wireless, speakers, still, need, power, so, require, a, nearby, ac, power, outlet, or, onboard, batteries, only, the, wire, for, the, audio, is, eliminated, speaker, specifications, generally, include, and, optionally, to, make, sound, a, loudspeaker, is, driven, by, modulated, electric, current, produced, by, an, amplifier, that, passes, through, a, speaker, coil, which, then, through, inductance, creates, a, magnetic, field, around, the, coil, the, electric, current, variations, that, pass, through, the, speaker, are, thus, converted, to, a, varying, magnetic, field, whose, interaction, with, the, driver, s, magnetic, field, moves, the, speaker, diaphragm, which, thus, forces, the, driver, to, produce, air, motion, that, is, similar, to, the, original, signal, from, the, amplifier, the, load, that, a, driver, presents, to, an, amplifier, consists, of, a, complex, electrical, impedance, a, combination, of, resistance, and, both, capacitive, and, inductive, reactance, which, combines, properties, of, the, driver, its, mechanical, motion, the, effects, of, crossover, components, if, any, are, in, the, signal, path, between, amplifier, and, driver, and, the, effects, of, air, loading, on, the, driver, as, modified, by, the, enclosure, and, its, environment, most, amplifiers, output, specifications, are, given, at, a, specific, power, into, an, ideal, resistive, load, however, a, loudspeaker, does, not, have, a, constant, impedance, across, its, frequency, range, instead, the, voice, coil, is, inductive, the, driver, has, mechanical, resonances, the, enclosure, changes, the, driver, s, electrical, and, mechanical, characteristics, and, a, passive, crossover, between, the, drivers, and, the, amplifier, contributes, its, own, variations, the, result, is, a, load, impedance, that, varies, widely, with, frequency, and, usually, a, varying, phase, relationship, between, voltage, and, current, as, well, also, changing, with, frequency, some, amplifiers, can, cope, with, the, variation, better, than, others, can, examples, of, typical, loudspeaker, measurement, are, amplitude, and, phase, characteristics, vs, frequency, impulse, response, under, one, or, more, conditions, e, g, square, waves, sine, wave, bursts, etc, directivity, vs, frequency, e, g, horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc, harmonic, and, intermodulation, distortion, vs, sound, pressure, level, spl, output, using, any, of, several, test, signals, stored, energy, i, e, ringing, at, various, frequencies, impedance, vs, frequency, and, small, signal, vs, large, signal, performance, most, of, these, measurements, require, sophisticated, and, often, expensive, equipment, to, perform, the, sound, pressure, level, spl, a, loudspeaker, produces, is, measured, in, decibels, db, spl, loudspeaker, efficiency, is, defined, as, the, sound, power, output, divided, by, the, electrical, power, input, most, loudspeakers, are, inefficient, transducers, only, about, 1, of, the, electrical, energy, sent, by, an, amplifier, to, a, typical, home, loudspeaker, is, converted, to, acoustic, energy, the, remainder, is, converted, to, heat, mostly, in, the, voice, coil, and, magnet, assembly, the, main, reason, for, this, is, the, difficulty, of, achieving, proper, impedance, matching, between, the, acoustic, impedance, of, the, drive, unit, and, the, air, it, radiates, into, the, efficiency, of, loudspeaker, drivers, varies, with, frequency, as, well, for, instance, the, output, of, a, woofer, driver, decreases, as, the, input, frequency, decreases, because, of, the, increasingly, poor, impedance, match, between, air, and, the, driver, driver, ratings, based, on, the, spl, for, a, given, input, are, called, sensitivity, ratings, and, are, notionally, similar, to, efficiency, sensitivity, is, usually, defined, as, the, spl, in, decibels, at, 1, w, electrical, input, measured, at, 1, meter, often, at, a, single, frequency, the, voltage, used, is, often, 2, 83, v, rms, which, results, in, 1, watt, into, a, nominal, 8, speaker, impedance, measurements, taken, with, this, reference, are, quoted, as, db, with, 2, 83, v, 1, m, the, sound, pressure, output, is, measured, at, or, mathematically, scaled, to, be, equivalent, to, a, measurement, taken, at, one, meter, from, the, loudspeaker, and, on, axis, directly, in, front, of, it, under, the, condition, that, the, loudspeaker, is, radiating, into, an, infinitely, large, space, and, mounted, on, an, infinite, baffle, clearly, then, sensitivity, does, not, correlate, precisely, with, efficiency, as, it, also, depends, on, the, directivity, of, the, driver, being, tested, and, the, acoustic, environment, in, front, of, the, actual, loudspeaker, for, example, a, cheerleader, s, horn, produces, more, sound, output, in, the, direction, it, is, pointed, by, concentrating, sound, waves, from, the, cheerleader, in, one, direction, thus, focusing, them, the, horn, also, improves, impedance, matching, between, the, voice, and, the, air, which, produces, more, acoustic, power, for, a, given, speaker, power, in, some, cases, improved, impedance, matching, via, careful, enclosure, design, lets, the, speaker, produce, more, acoustic, power, typical, home, loudspeakers, have, sensitivities, of, about, 85, to, 95, db, for, 1, w, 1, m, an, efficiency, of, 0, 5, 4, sound, reinforcement, and, public, address, loudspeakers, have, sensitivities, of, perhaps, 95, to, 102, db, for, 1, w, 1, m, an, efficiency, of, 4, 10, rock, concert, stadium, pa, marine, hailing, etc, speakers, generally, have, higher, sensitivities, of, 103, to, 110, db, for, 1, w, 1, m, an, efficiency, of, 10, 20, since, sensitivity, and, power, handling, are, largely, independent, properties, a, driver, with, a, higher, maximum, power, rating, cannot, necessarily, be, driven, to, louder, levels, than, a, lower, rated, one, in, the, example, that, follows, assume, for, simplicity, that, the, drivers, being, compared, have, the, same, electrical, impedance, are, operated, at, the, same, frequency, within, both, driver, s, respective, passbands, and, that, power, compression, and, distortion, are, insignificant, a, speaker, 3, db, more, sensitive, than, another, produces, double, the, sound, power, is, 3, db, louder, for, the, same, electrical, power, input, thus, a, 100, w, driver, a, rated, at, 92, db, for, 1, w, 1, m, sensitivity, puts, out, twice, as, much, acoustic, power, as, a, 200, w, driver, b, rated, at, 89, db, for, 1, w, 1, m, when, both, are, driven, with, 100, w, of, electrical, power, in, this, example, when, driven, at, 100, w, speaker, a, produces, the, same, spl, or, loudness, as, speaker, b, would, produce, with, 200, w, input, thus, a, 3, db, increase, in, the, sensitivity, of, the, speaker, means, that, it, needs, half, the, amplifier, power, to, achieve, a, given, spl, this, translates, into, a, smaller, less, complex, power, amplifier, and, often, to, reduced, overall, system, cost, it, is, typically, not, possible, to, combine, high, efficiency, especially, at, low, frequencies, with, compact, enclosure, size, and, adequate, low, frequency, response, one, can, for, the, most, part, choose, only, two, of, the, three, parameters, when, designing, a, speaker, system, so, for, example, if, extended, low, frequency, performance, and, small, box, size, are, important, one, must, accept, low, efficiency, this, rule, of, thumb, is, sometimes, called, hofmann, s, iron, law, after, j, a, hofmann, the, h, in, klh, the, interaction, of, a, loudspeaker, system, with, its, environment, is, complex, and, is, largely, out, of, the, loudspeaker, designer, s, control, most, listening, rooms, present, a, more, or, less, reflective, environment, depending, on, size, shape, volume, and, furnishings, this, means, the, sound, reaching, a, listener, s, ears, consists, not, only, of, sound, directly, from, the, speaker, system, but, also, the, same, sound, delayed, by, traveling, to, and, from, and, being, modified, by, one, or, more, surfaces, these, reflected, sound, waves, when, added, to, the, direct, sound, cause, cancellation, and, addition, at, assorted, frequencies, e, g, from, resonant, room, modes, thus, changing, the, timbre, and, character, of, the, sound, at, the, listener, s, ears, the, human, brain, is, very, sensitive, to, small, variations, including, some, of, these, and, this, is, part, of, the, reason, why, a, loudspeaker, system, sounds, different, at, different, listening, positions, or, in, different, rooms, a, significant, factor, in, the, sound, of, a, loudspeaker, system, is, the, amount, of, absorption, and, diffusion, present, in, the, environment, clapping, one, s, hands, in, a, typical, empty, room, without, draperies, or, carpet, produces, a, zippy, fluttery, echo, due, both, to, a, lack, of, absorption, and, to, reverberation, that, is, repeated, echoes, from, flat, reflective, walls, floor, and, ceiling, the, addition, of, hard, surfaced, furniture, wall, hangings, shelving, and, even, baroque, plaster, ceiling, decoration, changes, the, echoes, primarily, because, of, diffusion, caused, by, reflective, objects, with, shapes, and, surfaces, having, sizes, on, the, order, of, the, sound, wavelengths, this, somewhat, breaks, up, the, simple, reflections, otherwise, caused, by, bare, flat, surfaces, and, spreads, the, reflected, energy, of, an, incident, wave, over, a, larger, angle, on, reflection, in, a, typical, rectangular, listening, room, the, hard, parallel, surfaces, of, the, walls, floor, and, ceiling, cause, primary, acoustic, resonance, nodes, in, each, of, the, three, dimensions, left, right, up, down, and, forward, backward, furthermore, there, are, more, complex, resonance, modes, involving, three, four, five, and, even, all, six, boundary, surfaces, combining, to, create, standing, waves, this, is, called, speaker, boundary, interference, response, sbir, low, frequencies, excite, these, modes, the, most, since, long, wavelengths, are, not, much, affected, by, furniture, compositions, or, placement, the, mode, spacing, is, critical, especially, in, small, and, medium, size, rooms, like, recording, studios, home, theaters, and, broadcast, studios, the, proximity, of, the, loudspeakers, to, room, boundaries, affects, how, strongly, the, resonances, are, excited, as, well, as, affecting, the, relative, strength, at, each, frequency, the, location, of, the, listener, is, critical, too, as, a, position, near, a, boundary, can, have, a, great, effect, on, the, perceived, balance, of, frequencies, this, is, because, standing, wave, patterns, are, most, easily, heard, in, these, locations, and, at, lower, frequencies, below, the, schroeder, frequency, typically, around, 200, 300, hz, depending, on, room, size, acousticians, in, studying, the, radiation, of, sound, sources, have, developed, some, concepts, important, to, understanding, how, loudspeakers, are, perceived, the, simplest, possible, radiating, source, is, a, point, source, sometimes, called, a, simple, source, an, ideal, point, source, is, an, infinitesimally, small, point, radiating, sound, it, may, be, easier, to, imagine, a, tiny, pulsating, sphere, uniformly, increasing, and, decreasing, in, diameter, sending, out, sound, waves, in, all, directions, equally, independent, of, frequency, any, object, radiating, sound, including, a, loudspeaker, system, can, be, thought, of, as, being, composed, of, combinations, of, such, simple, point, sources, the, radiation, pattern, of, a, combination, of, point, sources, is, not, the, same, as, for, a, single, source, but, depends, on, the, distance, and, orientation, between, the, sources, the, position, relative, to, them, from, which, the, listener, hears, the, combination, and, the, frequency, of, the, sound, involved, using, geometry, and, calculus, some, simple, combinations, of, sources, are, easily, solved, others, are, not, one, simple, combination, is, two, simple, sources, separated, by, a, distance, and, vibrating, out, of, phase, one, miniature, sphere, expanding, while, the, other, is, contracting, the, pair, is, known, as, a, doublet, or, dipole, and, the, radiation, of, this, combination, is, similar, to, that, of, a, very, small, dynamic, loudspeaker, operating, without, a, baffle, the, directivity, of, a, dipole, is, a, figure, 8, shape, with, maximum, output, along, a, vector, that, connects, the, two, sources, and, minimums, to, the, sides, when, the, observing, point, is, equidistant, from, the, two, sources, where, the, sum, of, the, positive, and, negative, waves, cancel, each, other, while, most, drivers, are, dipoles, depending, on, the, enclosure, to, which, they, are, attached, they, may, radiate, as, monopoles, dipoles, or, bipoles, if, mounted, on, a, finite, baffle, and, these, out, of, phase, waves, are, allowed, to, interact, dipole, peaks, and, nulls, in, the, frequency, response, result, when, the, rear, radiation, is, absorbed, or, trapped, in, a, box, the, diaphragm, becomes, a, monopole, radiator, bipolar, speakers, made, by, mounting, in, phase, monopoles, both, moving, out, of, or, into, the, box, in, unison, on, opposite, sides, of, a, box, are, a, method, of, approaching, omnidirectional, radiation, patterns, in, real, life, individual, drivers, are, complex, 3d, shapes, such, as, cones, and, domes, and, they, are, placed, on, a, baffle, for, various, reasons, a, mathematical, expression, for, the, directivity, of, a, complex, shape, based, on, modeling, combinations, of, point, sources, is, usually, not, possible, but, in, the, far, field, the, directivity, of, a, loudspeaker, with, a, circular, diaphragm, is, close, to, that, of, a, flat, circular, piston, so, it, can, be, used, as, an, illustrative, simplification, for, discussion, as, a, simple, example, of, the, mathematical, physics, involved, consider, the, following, the, formula, for, far, field, directivity, of, a, flat, circular, piston, in, an, infinite, baffle, is, p, p, 0,

uniformly, for, low, frequencies, wavelengths, longer, than, the, dimensions, of, the, planar, source, and, as, frequency, increases, the, sound, from, such, a, source, focuses, into, an, increasingly, narrower, angle, the, smaller, the, driver, the, higher, the, frequency, where, this, narrowing, of, directivity, occurs, even, if, the, diaphragm, is, not, perfectly, circular, this, effect, occurs, such, that, larger, sources, are, more, directive, several, loudspeaker, designs, approximate, this, behavior, most, are, electrostatic, or, planar, magnetic, designs, various, manufacturers, use, different, driver, mounting, arrangements, to, create, a, specific, type, of, sound, field, in, the, space, for, which, they, are, designed, the, resulting, radiation, patterns, may, be, intended, to, more, closely, simulate, the, way, sound, is, produced, by, real, instruments, or, simply, create, a, controlled, energy, distribution, from, the, input, signal, some, using, this, approach, are, called, monitors, as, they, are, useful, in, checking, the, signal, just, recorded, in, a, studio, an, example, of, the, first, is, a, room, corner, system, with, many, small, drivers, on, the, surface, of, a, 1, 8, sphere, a, system, design, of, this, type, was, patented, and, produced, commercially, by, professor, amar, bose, the, 2201, later, bose, models, have, deliberately, emphasized, production, of, both, direct, and, reflected, sound, by, the, loudspeaker, itself, regardless, of, its, environment, the, designs, are, controversial, in, high, fidelity, circles, but, have, proven, commercially, successful, several, other, manufacturers, designs, follow, similar, principles, directivity, is, an, important, issue, because, it, affects, the, frequency, balance, of, sound, a, listener, hears, and, also, the, interaction, of, the, speaker, system, with, the, room, and, its, contents, a, very, directive, sometimes, termed, beamy, speaker, i, e, on, an, axis, perpendicular, to, the, speaker, face, may, result, in, a, reverberant, field, lacking, in, high, frequencies, giving, the, impression, the, speaker, is, deficient, in, treble, even, though, it, measures, well, on, axis, e, g, flat, across, the, entire, frequency, range, speakers, with, very, wide, or, rapidly, increasing, directivity, at, high, frequencies, can, give, the, impression, that, there, is, too, much, treble, if, the, listener, is, on, axis, or, too, little, if, the, listener, is, off, axis, this, is, part, of, the, reason, why, on, axis, frequency, response, measurement, is, not, a, complete, characterization, of, the, sound, of, a, given, loudspeaker, while, dynamic, cone, speakers, remain, the, most, popular, choice, many, other, speaker, technologies, exist, 705, 714, the, original, loudspeaker, design, was, the, moving, iron, unlike, the, newer, dynamic, moving, coil, design, a, moving, iron, speaker, uses, a, stationary, coil, to, vibrate, a, magnetized, piece, of, metal, called, the, iron, reed, or, armature, the, metal, is, either, attached, to, the, diaphragm, or, is, the, diaphragm, itself, this, design, originally, appeared, in, the, early, telephone, moving, iron, drivers, are, inefficient, and, can, only, produce, a, small, band, of, sound, they, require, large, magnets, and, coils, to, increase, force, balanced, armature, drivers, a, type, of, moving, iron, driver, use, an, armature, that, moves, like, a, see, saw, or, diving, board, since, they, are, not, damped, they, are, highly, efficient, but, they, also, produce, strong, resonances, they, are, still, used, today, for, high, end, earphones, and, hearing, aids, where, small, size, and, high, efficiency, are, important, piezoelectric, speakers, are, frequently, used, as, beepers, in, watches, and, other, electronic, devices, and, are, sometimes, used, as, tweeters, in, less, expensive, speaker, systems, such, as, computer, speakers, and, portable, radios, piezoelectric, speakers, have, several, advantages, over, conventional, loudspeakers, they, are, resistant, to, overloads, that, would, normally, destroy, most, high, frequency, drivers, and, they, can, be, used, without, a, crossover, due, to, their, electrical, properties, there, are, also, disadvantages, some, amplifiers, can, oscillate, when, driving, capacitive, loads, like, most, piezoelectrics, which, results, in, distortion, or, damage, to, the, amplifier, additionally, their, frequency, response, in, most, cases, is, inferior, to, that, of, other, technologies, this, is, why, they, are, generally, used, in, single, frequency, beeper, or, non, critical, applications, piezoelectric, speakers, can, have, extended, high, frequency, output, and, this, is, useful, in, some, specialized, circumstances, for, instance, sonar, applications, in, which, piezoelectric, variants, are, used, as, both, output, devices, generating, underwater, sound, and, as, input, devices, acting, as, the, sensing, components, of, underwater, microphones, they, have, advantages, in, these, applications, not, the, least, of, which, is, simple, and, solid, state, construction, that, resists, seawater, better, than, a, ribbon, or, cone, based, device, would, in, 2013, kyocera, introduced, piezoelectric, ultra, thin, medium, size, film, speakers, with, only, 1, millimeter, of, thickness, and, 7, grams, of, weight, for, their, 55, oled, televisions, and, they, hope, the, speakers, will, also, be, used, in, pcs, and, tablets, besides, medium, size, there, are, also, large, and, small, sizes, which, can, all, produce, relatively, the, same, quality, of, sound, and, volume, within, 180, degrees, the, highly, responsive, speaker, material, provides, better, clarity, than, traditional, tv, speakers, instead, of, a, voice, coil, driving, a, speaker, cone, a, magnetostatic, speaker, uses, an, array, of, metal, strips, bonded, to, a, large, film, membrane, the, magnetic, field, produced, by, signal, current, flowing, through, the, strips, interacts, with, the, field, of, permanent, bar, magnets, mounted, behind, them, the, force, produced, moves, the, membrane, and, so, the, air, in, front, of, it, typically, these, designs, are, less, efficient, than, conventional, moving, coil, speakers, magnetostrictive, transducers, based, on, magnetostriction, have, been, predominantly, used, as, sonar, ultrasonic, sound, wave, radiators, but, their, use, has, spread, also, to, audio, speaker, systems, magnetostrictive, speaker, drivers, have, some, special, advantages, they, can, provide, greater, force, with, smaller, excursions, than, other, technologies, low, excursion, can, avoid, distortions, from, large, excursion, as, in, other, designs, the, magnetizing, coil, is, stationary, and, therefore, more, easily, cooled, they, are, robust, because, delicate, suspensions, and, voice, coils, are, not, required, magnetostrictive, speaker, modules, have, been, produced, by, fostex, and, feonic, and, subwoofer, drivers, have, also, been, produced, electrostatic, loudspeakers, use, a, high, voltage, electric, field, rather, than, a, magnetic, field, to, drive, a, thin, statically, charged, membrane, because, they, are, driven, over, the, entire, membrane, surface, rather, than, from, a, small, voice, coil, they, ordinarily, provide, a, more, linear, and, lower, distortion, motion, than, dynamic, drivers, they, also, have, a, relatively, narrow, dispersion, pattern, that, can, make, for, precise, sound, field, positioning, however, their, optimum, listening, area, is, small, and, they, are, not, very, efficient, speakers, they, have, the, disadvantage, that, the, diaphragm, excursion, is, severely, limited, because, of, practical, construction, limitations, the, further, apart, the, stators, are, positioned, the, higher, the, voltage, must, be, to, achieve, acceptable, efficiency, this, increases, the, tendency, for, electrical, arcs, as, well, as, increasing, the, speaker, s, attraction, of, dust, particles, arcing, remains, a, potential, problem, with, current, technologies, especially, when, the, panels, are, allowed, to, collect, dust, or, dirt, and, are, driven, with, high, signal, levels, electrostatics, are, inherently, dipole, radiators, and, due, to, the, thin, flexible, membrane, are, less, suited, for, use, in, enclosures, to, reduce, low, frequency, cancellation, as, with, common, cone, drivers, due, to, this, and, the, low, excursion, capability, full, range, electrostatic, loudspeakers, are, large, by, nature, and, the, bass, rolls, off, at, a, frequency, corresponding, to, a, quarter, wavelength, of, the, narrowest, panel, dimension, to, reduce, the, size, of, commercial, products, they, are, sometimes, used, as, a, high, frequency, driver, in, combination, with, a, conventional, dynamic, driver, that, handles, the, bass, frequencies, effectively, electrostatics, are, usually, driven, through, a, step, up, transformer, that, multiplies, the, voltage, swings, produced, by, the, power, amplifier, this, transformer, also, multiplies, the, capacitive, load, that, is, inherent, in, electrostatic, transducers, which, means, the, effective, impedance, presented, to, the, power, amplifiers, varies, widely, by, frequency, a, speaker, that, is, nominally, 8, ohms, may, actually, present, a, load, of, 1, ohm, at, higher, frequencies, which, is, challenging, to, some, amplifier, designs, a, ribbon, speaker, consists, of, a, thin, metal, film, ribbon, suspended, in, a, magnetic, field, the, electrical, signal, is, applied, to, the, ribbon, which, moves, with, it, to, create, the, sound, the, advantage, of, a, ribbon, driver, is, that, the, ribbon, has, very, little, mass, thus, it, can, accelerate, very, quickly, yielding, a, very, good, high, frequency, response, ribbon, loudspeakers, are, often, very, fragile, most, ribbon, tweeters, emit, sound, in, a, dipole, pattern, a, few, have, backings, that, limit, the, dipole, radiation, pattern, above, and, below, the, ends, of, the, more, or, less, rectangular, ribbon, there, is, less, audible, output, due, to, phase, cancellation, but, the, precise, amount, of, directivity, depends, on, the, ribbon, length, ribbon, designs, generally, require, exceptionally, powerful, magnets, which, makes, them, costly, to, manufacture, ribbons, have, a, very, low, resistance, that, most, amplifiers, cannot, drive, directly, as, a, result, a, step, down, transformer, is, typically, used, to, increase, the, current, through, the, ribbon, the, amplifier, sees, a, load, that, is, the, ribbon, s, resistance, times, the, transformer, turns, ratio, squared, the, transformer, must, be, carefully, designed, so, that, its, frequency, response, and, parasitic, losses, do, not, degrade, the, sound, further, increasing, cost, and, complication, relative, to, conventional, designs, planar, magnetic, speakers, having, printed, or, embedded, conductors, on, a, flat, diaphragm, are, sometimes, described, as, ribbons, but, are, not, truly, ribbon, speakers, the, term, planar, is, generally, reserved, for, speakers, with, roughly, rectangular, flat, surfaces, that, radiate, in, a, bipolar, i, e, front, and, back, manner, planar, magnetic, speakers, consist, of, a, flexible, membrane, with, a, voice, coil, printed, or, mounted, on, it, the, current, flowing, through, the, coil, interacts, with, the, magnetic, field, of, carefully, placed, magnets, on, either, side, of, the, diaphragm, causing, the, membrane, to, vibrate, more, or, less, uniformly, and, without, much, bending, or, wrinkling, the, driving, force, covers, a, large, percentage, of, the, membrane, surface, and, reduces, resonance, problems, inherent, in, coil, driven, flat, diaphragms, bending, wave, transducers, use, a, diaphragm, that, is, intentionally, flexible, the, rigidity, of, the, material, increases, from, the, center, to, the, outside, short, wavelengths, radiate, primarily, from, the, inner, area, while, longer, waves, reach, the, edge, of, the, speaker, to, prevent, reflections, from, the, outside, back, into, the, center, long, waves, are, absorbed, by, a, surrounding, damper, such, transducers, can, cover, a, wide, frequency, range, 80, hz, to, 35, 000, hz, and, have, been, promoted, as, being, close, to, an, ideal, point, sound, source, this, uncommon, approach, is, being, taken, by, only, a, very, few, manufacturers, in, very, different, arrangements, the, ohm, walsh, loudspeakers, use, a, unique, driver, designed, by, lincoln, walsh, who, had, been, a, radar, development, engineer, in, wwii, he, became, interested, in, audio, equipment, design, and, his, last, project, was, a, unique, one, way, speaker, using, a, single, driver, the, cone, faced, down, into, a, sealed, airtight, enclosure, rather, than, move, back, and, forth, as, conventional, speakers, do, the, cone, rippled, and, created, sound, in, a, manner, known, in, rf, electronics, as, a, transmission, line, the, new, speaker, created, a, cylindrical, sound, field, lincoln, walsh, died, before, his, speaker, was, released, to, the, public, the, ohm, acoustics, firm, has, produced, several, loudspeaker, models, using, the, walsh, driver, design, since, then, german, physiks, an, audio, equipment, firm, in, germany, also, produces, speakers, using, this, approach, the, german, firm, manger, has, designed, and, produced, a, bending, wave, driver, that, at, first, glance, appears, conventional, in, fact, the, round, panel, attached, to, the, voice, coil, bends, in, a, carefully, controlled, way, to, produce, full, range, sound, josef, w, manger, was, awarded, with, the, rudolf, diesel, medaille, for, extraordinary, developments, and, inventions, by, the, german, institute, of, inventions, there, have, been, many, attempts, to, reduce, the, size, of, speaker, systems, or, alternatively, to, make, them, less, obvious, one, such, attempt, was, the, development, of, exciter, transducer, coils, mounted, to, flat, panels, to, act, as, sound, sources, most, accurately, called, exciter, panel, drivers, these, can, then, be, made, in, a, neutral, color, and, hung, on, walls, where, they, are, less, noticeable, than, many, speakers, or, can, be, deliberately, painted, with, patterns, in, which, case, they, can, function, decoratively, there, are, two, related, problems, with, flat, panel, techniques, first, a, flat, panel, is, necessarily, more, flexible, than, a, cone, shape, in, the, same, material, and, therefore, moves, as, a, single, unit, even, less, and, second, resonances, in, the, panel, are, difficult, to, control, leading, to, considerable, distortions, some, progress, has, been, made, using, such, lightweight, rigid, materials, such, as, styrofoam, and, there, have, been, several, flat, panel, systems, commercially, produced, in, recent, years, oskar, heil, invented, the, air, motion, transducer, in, the, 1960s, in, this, approach, a, pleated, diaphragm, is, mounted, in, a, magnetic, field, and, forced, to, close, and, open, under, control, of, a, music, signal, air, is, forced, from, between, the, pleats, in, accordance, with, the, imposed, signal, generating, sound, the, drivers, are, less, fragile, than, ribbons, and, considerably, more, efficient, and, able, to, produce, higher, absolute, output, levels, than, ribbon, electrostatic, or, planar, magnetic, tweeter, designs, ess, a, california, manufacturer, licensed, the, design, employed, heil, and, produced, a, range, of, speaker, systems, using, his, tweeters, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, lafayette, radio, a, large, us, retail, store, chain, also, sold, speaker, systems, using, such, tweeters, for, a, time, there, are, several, manufacturers, of, these, drivers, at, least, two, in, germany, one, of, which, produces, a, range, of, high, end, professional, speakers, using, tweeters, and, mid, range, drivers, based, on, the, technology, and, the, drivers, are, increasingly, used, in, professional, audio, martin, logan, produces, several, amt, speakers, in, the, us, and, goldenear, technologies, incorporates, them, in, its, entire, speaker, line, in, 2013, a, research, team, introduced, a, transparent, ionic, conduction, speaker, which, has, two, sheets, of, transparent, conductive, gel, and, a, layer, of, transparent, rubber, in, between, to, make, high, voltage, and, high, actuation, work, to, reproduce, good, sound, quality, the, speaker, is, suitable, for, robotics, mobile, computing, and, adaptive, optics, fields, digital, speakers, have, been, the, subject, of, experiments, performed, by, bell, labs, as, far, back, as, the, 1920s, the, design, is, simple, each, bit, controls, a, driver, which, is, either, fully, on, or, off, problems, with, this, design, have, led, manufacturers, to, abandon, it, as, impractical, for, the, present, first, for, a, reasonable, number, of, bits, required, for, adequate, sound, reproduction, quality, the, physical, size, of, a, speaker, system, becomes, very, large, secondly, due, to, inherent, analog, to, digital, conversion, problems, the, effect, of, aliasing, is, unavoidable, so, that, the, audio, output, is, reflected, at, equal, amplitude, in, the, frequency, domain, on, the, other, side, of, the, nyquist, limit, half, the, sampling, frequency, causing, an, unacceptably, high, level, of, ultrasonics, to, accompany, the, desired, output, no, workable, scheme, has, been, found, to, adequately, deal, with, this, plasma, arc, loudspeakers, use, electrical, plasma, as, a, radiating, element, since, plasma, has, minimal, mass, but, is, charged, and, therefore, can, be, manipulated, by, an, electric, field, the, result, is, a, very, linear, output, at, frequencies, far, higher, than, the, audible, range, problems, of, maintenance, and, reliability, for, this, approach, tend, to, make, it, unsuitable, for, mass, market, use, in, 1978, alan, e, hill, of, the, air, force, weapons, laboratory, in, albuquerque, nm, designed, the, plasmatronics, hill, type, i, a, tweeter, whose, plasma, was, generated, from, helium, gas, this, avoided, the, ozone, and, nox, produced, by, rf, decomposition, of, air, in, an, earlier, generation, of, plasma, tweeters, made, by, the, pioneering, dukane, corporation, who, produced, the, ionovac, marketed, as, the, ionofane, in, the, uk, during, the, 1950s, a, less, expensive, variation, on, this, theme, is, the, use, of, a, flame, for, the, driver, as, flames, contain, ionized, electrically, charged, gases, in, 2008, researchers, of, tsinghua, university, demonstrated, a, thermoacoustic, loudspeaker, or, thermophone, of, carbon, nanotube, thin, film, whose, working, mechanism, is, a, thermoacoustic, effect, sound, frequency, electric, currents, are, used, to, periodically, heat, the, cnt, and, thus, result, in, sound, generation, in, the, surrounding, air, the, cnt, thin, film, loudspeaker, is, transparent, stretchable, and, flexible, in, 2013, researchers, of, tsinghua, university, further, present, a, thermoacoustic, earphone, of, carbon, nanotube, thin, yarn, and, a, thermoacoustic, surface, mounted, device, they, are, both, fully, integrated, devices, and, compatible, with, si, based, semiconducting, technology, a, rotary, woofer, is, essentially, a, fan, with, blades, that, constantly, change, their, pitch, allowing, them, to, easily, push, the, air, back, and, forth, rotary, woofers, are, able, to, efficiently, reproduce, subsonic, frequencies, which, are, difficult, to, impossible, to, achieve, on, a, traditional, speaker, with, a, diaphragm, they, are, often, employed, in, movie, theaters, to, recreate, rumbling, bass, effects, such, as, explosions
