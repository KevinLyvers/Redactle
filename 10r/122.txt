signal, processing, is, an, electrical, engineering, subfield, that, focuses, on, analyzing, modifying, and, synthesizing, signals, such, as, sound, images, potential, fields, seismic, signals, altimetry, processing, and, scientific, measurements, signal, processing, techniques, are, used, to, optimize, transmissions, digital, storage, efficiency, correcting, distorted, signals, improve, subjective, video, quality, and, to, detect, or, pinpoint, components, of, interest, in, a, measured, signal, according, to, alan, v, oppenheim, and, ronald, w, schafer, the, principles, of, signal, processing, can, be, found, in, the, classical, numerical, analysis, techniques, of, the, 17th, century, they, further, state, that, the, digital, refinement, of, these, techniques, can, be, found, in, the, digital, control, systems, of, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, in, 1948, claude, shannon, wrote, the, influential, paper, a, mathematical, theory, of, communication, which, was, published, in, the, bell, system, technical, journal, the, paper, laid, the, groundwork, for, later, development, of, information, communication, systems, and, the, processing, of, signals, for, transmission, signal, processing, matured, and, flourished, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, and, digital, signal, processing, became, widely, used, with, specialized, digital, signal, processor, chips, in, the, 1980s, a, signal, is, a, function, x, t, displaystyle, x, t, where, this, function, is, either, analog, signal, processing, is, for, signals, that, have, not, been, digitized, as, in, most, 20th, century, radio, telephone, and, television, systems, this, involves, linear, electronic, circuits, as, well, as, nonlinear, ones, the, former, are, for, instance, passive, filters, active, filters, additive, mixers, integrators, and, delay, lines, nonlinear, circuits, include, compandors, multipliers, frequency, mixers, voltage, controlled, amplifiers, voltage, controlled, filters, voltage, controlled, oscillators, and, phase, locked, loops, continuous, time, signal, processing, is, for, signals, that, vary, with, the, change, of, continuous, domain, without, considering, some, individual, interrupted, points, the, methods, of, signal, processing, include, time, domain, frequency, domain, and, complex, frequency, domain, this, technology, mainly, discusses, the, modeling, of, a, linear, time, invariant, continuous, system, integral, of, the, system, s, zero, state, response, setting, up, system, function, and, the, continuous, time, filtering, of, deterministic, signals, discrete, time, signal, processing, is, for, sampled, signals, defined, only, at, discrete, points, in, time, and, as, such, are, quantized, in, time, but, not, in, magnitude, analog, discrete, time, signal, processing, is, a, technology, based, on, electronic, devices, such, as, sample, and, hold, circuits, analog, time, division, multiplexers, analog, delay, lines, and, analog, feedback, shift, registers, this, technology, was, a, predecessor, of, digital, signal, processing, see, below, and, is, still, used, in, advanced, processing, of, gigahertz, signals, the, concept, of, discrete, time, signal, processing, also, refers, to, a, theoretical, discipline, that, establishes, a, mathematical, basis, for, digital, signal, processing, without, taking, quantization, error, into, consideration, digital, signal, processing, is, the, processing, of, digitized, discrete, time, sampled, signals, processing, is, done, by, general, purpose, computers, or, by, digital, circuits, such, as, asics, field, programmable, gate, arrays, or, specialized, digital, signal, processors, dsp, chips, typical, arithmetical, operations, include, fixed, point, and, floating, point, real, valued, and, complex, valued, multiplication, and, addition, other, typical, operations, supported, by, the, hardware, are, circular, buffers, and, lookup, tables, examples, of, algorithms, are, the, fast, fourier, transform, fft, finite, impulse, response, fir, filter, infinite, impulse, response, iir, filter, and, adaptive, filters, such, as, the, wiener, and, kalman, filters, nonlinear, signal, processing, involves, the, analysis, and, processing, of, signals, produced, from, nonlinear, systems, and, can, be, in, the, time, frequency, or, spatiotemporal, domains, nonlinear, systems, can, produce, highly, complex, behaviors, including, bifurcations, chaos, harmonics, and, subharmonics, which, cannot, be, produced, or, analyzed, using, linear, methods, polynomial, signal, processing, is, a, type, of, non, linear, signal, processing, where, polynomial, systems, may, be, interpreted, as, conceptually, straightforward, extensions, of, linear, systems, to, the, non, linear, case, statistical, signal, processing, is, an, approach, which, treats, signals, as, stochastic, processes, utilizing, their, statistical, properties, to, perform, signal, processing, tasks, statistical, techniques, are, widely, used, in, signal, processing, applications, for, example, one, can, model, the, probability, distribution, of, noise, incurred, when, photographing, an, image, and, construct, techniques, based, on, this, model, to, reduce, the, noise, in, the, resulting, image, in, communication, systems, signal, processing, may, occur, at
