a, pyramid, in, the, geometric, sense, the, base, of, a, pyramid, can, be, of, any, polygon, shape, such, as, triangular, or, quadrilateral, and, its, lines, either, filled, or, step, a, pyramid, has, the, majority, of, its, mass, closer, to, the, ground, with, less, mass, towards, the, pyramidion, at, the, apex, this, is, due, to, the, gradual, decrease, in, the, cross, sectional, area, along, the, vertical, axis, with, increasing, elevation, this, offers, a, weight, distribution, that, allowed, early, civilizations, to, create, monumental, structures, civilizations, in, many, parts, of, the, world, have, built, pyramids, the, largest, pyramid, by, volume, is, the, mesoamerican, great, pyramid, of, cholula, in, the, mexican, state, of, puebla, for, millennia, the, largest, structures, on, earth, were, pyramids, first, the, red, pyramid, in, the, dashur, necropolis, and, then, the, great, pyramid, of, khufu, both, in, egypt, the, latter, is, the, only, extant, example, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, the, mesopotamians, built, the, earliest, pyramidal, structures, called, ziggurats, in, ancient, times, these, were, brightly, painted, in, gold, bronze, they, were, constructed, of, sun, dried, mud, brick, and, little, remains, of, them, ziggurats, were, built, by, the, sumerians, babylonians, elamites, akkadians, and, assyrians, each, ziggurat, was, part, of, a, temple, complex, that, included, other, buildings, the, ziggurat, s, precursors, were, raised, platforms, that, date, from, the, ubaid, period, of, the, fourth, millennium, bc, the, earliest, ziggurats, began, near, the, end, of, the, early, dynastic, period, the, original, pyramidal, structure, the, anu, ziggurat, dates, to, around, 4000, bc, the, white, temple, was, built, on, top, of, it, circa, 3500, bc, built, in, receding, tiers, upon, a, rectangular, oval, or, square, platform, the, ziggurat, was, a, pyramidal, structure, with, a, flat, top, sun, baked, bricks, made, up, the, core, of, the, ziggurat, with, facings, of, fired, bricks, on, the, outside, the, facings, were, often, glazed, in, different, colors, and, may, have, had, astrological, significance, kings, sometimes, had, their, names, engraved, on, them, the, number, of, tiers, ranged, from, two, to, seven, it, is, assumed, that, they, had, shrines, at, the, top, but, no, archaeological, evidence, supports, this, and, the, only, textual, evidence, is, from, herodotus, access, to, the, shrine, would, have, been, by, a, series, of, ramps, on, one, side, of, the, ziggurat, or, by, a, spiral, ramp, from, base, to, summit, the, most, famous, african, pyramids, are, in, egypt, huge, structures, built, of, bricks, or, stones, some, of, which, are, among, the, world, s, largest, constructions, they, are, shaped, in, reference, to, the, sun, s, rays, most, had, a, smoothed, white, limestone, surface, many, of, the, facing, stones, have, fallen, or, were, removed, and, used, for, construction, in, cairo, the, capstone, was, usually, made, of, limestone, granite, or, basalt, and, some, were, plated, with, electrum, ancient, egyptians, built, pyramids, from, 2700, bc, until, around, 1700, bc, the, first, pyramid, was, erected, during, the, third, dynasty, by, the, pharaoh, djoser, and, his, architect, imhotep, this, step, pyramid, consisted, of, six, stacked, mastabas, early, kings, such, as, snefru, built, pyramids, with, subsequent, kings, adding, to, the, number, until, the, end, of, the, middle, kingdom, the, age, of, the, pyramids, reached, its, zenith, at, giza, in, 2575, 2150, bc, the, last, king, to, build, royal, pyramids, was, ahmose, with, later, kings, hiding, their, tombs, in, the, hills, such, as, those, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, in, luxor, s, west, bank, in, medinat, habu, and, deir, el, medina, smaller, pyramids, were, built, by, individuals, smaller, pyramids, with, steeper, sides, were, built, by, the, nubians, who, ruled, egypt, in, the, late, period, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, is, the, largest, in, egypt, and, one, of, the, largest, in, the, world, at, 146, 6, metres, 481, ft, it, was, the, tallest, structure, in, the, world, until, the, lincoln, cathedral, was, finished, in, 1311, ad, its, base, covers, an, area, of, around, 53, 000, square, metres, 570, 000, sq, ft, the, great, pyramid, is, the, only, extant, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, ancient, egyptian, pyramids, were, in, most, cases, placed, west, of, the, river, nile, because, the, divine, pharaoh, s, soul, was, meant, to, join, with, the, sun, during, its, descent, before, continuing, with, the, sun, in, its, eternal, round, as, of, 2008, some, 135, pyramids, had, been, discovered, in, egypt, most, located, near, cairo, while, african, pyramids, are, commonly, associated, with, egypt, sudan, has, 220, extant, pyramids, the, most, in, the, world, nubian, pyramids, were, constructed, roughly, 240, of, them, at, three, sites, in,

heritage, site, unesco, describes, the, tomb, as, an, example, of, the, monumental, mud, building, traditions, of, the, west, african, sahel, the, complex, includes, the, pyramidal, tomb, two, mosques, a, cemetery, and, an, assembly, ground, at, 17, metres, 56, ft, in, height, it, is, the, largest, pre, colonial, architectural, monument, in, gao, it, is, a, notable, example, of, the, sudano, sahelian, architectural, style, that, later, spread, throughout, the, region, one, of, the, unique, structures, of, igbo, culture, was, the, nsude, pyramids, in, the, nigerian, town, of, nsude, northern, igboland, ten, pyramidal, structures, were, built, of, clay, mud, the, first, base, section, was, 60, ft, 18, m, in, circumference, and, 3, ft, 0, 9, m, in, height, the, next, stack, was, 45, ft, 14, m, in, circumference, circular, stacks, continued, to, the, top, the, structures, were, temples, for, the, god, ala, who, was, believed, to, reside, there, a, stick, was, placed, at, the, top, to, represent, the, god, s, residence, the, structures, were, laid, in, groups, of, five, parallel, to, each, other, because, it, was, built, of, clay, mud, like, the, deffufa, of, nubia, over, time, periodic, reconstruction, has, been, required, pausanias, 2nd, century, ad, mentions, two, buildings, resembling, pyramids, one, 19, kilometres, 12, mi, southwest, of, a, still, standing, structure, at, hellenikon, a, common, tomb, for, soldiers, who, died, in, a, legendary, struggle, for, the, throne, of, argos, and, another, that, he, was, told, was, the, tomb, of, argives, killed, in, a, battle, around, 669, 8, bc, neither, survives, and, no, evidence, indicates, that, they, resembled, egyptian, pyramids, at, least, two, surviving, pyramid, like, structures, are, available, to, study, one, at, hellenikon, and, the, other, at, ligourio, ligurio, a, village, near, the, ancient, theatre, epidaurus, these, buildings, have, inwardly, sloping, walls, but, bear, no, other, resemblance, to, egyptian, pyramids, they, had, large, central, rooms, unlike, egyptian, pyramids, and, the, hellenikon, structure, is, rectangular, rather, than, square, 12, 5, by, 14, metres, 41, by, 46, ft, which, means, that, the, sides, could, not, have, met, at, a, point, the, stone, used, to, build, these, structures, was, limestone, quarried, locally, and, was, cut, to, fit, not, into, freestanding, blocks, like, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, these, structures, were, dated, from, pot, shards, excavated, from, the, floor, and, grounds, the, latest, estimates, are, around, the, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, normally, this, technique, is, used, for, dating, pottery, but, researchers, used, it, to, try, to, date, stone, flakes, from, the, structure, walls, this, launched, debate, about, whether, or, not, these, structures, are, actually, older, than, egypt, part, of, the, black, athena, controversy, lefkowitz, criticised, this, research, suggesting, that, some, of, the, research, was, done, not, to, determine, the, reliability, of, the, dating, method, as, was, suggested, but, to, back, up, a, claim, and, to, make, points, about, pyramids, and, greek, civilization, she, claimed, that, not, only, were, the, results, imprecise, but, that, other, structures, mentioned, in, the, research, are, not, in, fact, pyramids, e, g, a, tomb, alleged, to, be, the, tomb, of, amphion, and, zethus, near, thebes, a, structure, at, stylidha, thessaly, which, is, a, long, wall, etc, she, pushed, the, possibility, that, the, stones, that, were, dated, might, have, been, recycled, from, earlier, constructions, she, claimed, that, earlier, research, from, the, 1930s, confirmed, in, the, 1980s, by, fracchia, was, ignored, liritzis, responded, that, lefkowitz, failed, to, understand, and, misinterpreted, the, methodology, the, pyramids, of, g, mar, refer, to, six, rectangular, pyramid, shaped, terraced, structures, built, from, lava, without, mortar, they, are, located, in, the, district, of, chacona, part, of, the, town, of, g, mar, on, the, island, of, tenerife, in, the, canary, islands, the, structures, were, dated, to, the, 19th, century, and, their, function, explained, as, a, byproduct, of, contemporary, agricultural, techniques, autochthonous, guanche, traditions, as, well, as, surviving, images, indicate, that, similar, structures, also, known, as, morras, majanos, molleros, or, paredones, were, built, in, many, locations, on, the, island, however, over, time, they, were, dismantled, and, used, as, building, material, g, mar, hostred, nine, pyramids, only, six, of, which, survive, the, 27, metre, high, pyramid, of, cestius, was, built, by, the, end, of, the, 1st, century, bc, and, survives, close, to, the, porta, san, paolo,
