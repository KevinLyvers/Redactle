navigation, is, a, field, of, study, that, focuses, on, the, process, of, monitoring, and, controlling, the, movement, of, a, craft, or, vehicle, from, one, place, to, another, the, field, of, navigation, includes, four, general, categories, land, navigation, marine, navigation, aeronautic, navigation, and, space, navigation, it, is, also, the, term, of, art, used, for, the, specialized, knowledge, used, by, navigators, to, perform, navigation, tasks, all, navigational, techniques, involve, locating, the, navigator, s, position, compared, to, known, locations, or, patterns, navigation, in, a, broader, sense, can, refer, to, any, skill, or, study, that, involves, the, determination, of, position, and, direction, in, this, sense, navigation, includes, orienteering, and, pedestrian, navigation, in, the, european, medieval, period, navigation, was, considered, part, of, the, set, of, seven, mechanical, arts, none, of, which, were, used, for, long, voyages, across, open, ocean, polynesian, navigation, is, probably, the, earliest, form, of, open, ocean, navigation, it, was, based, on, memory, and, observation, recorded, on, scientific, instruments, like, the, marshall, islands, stick, charts, of, ocean, swells, early, pacific, polynesians, used, the, motion, of, stars, weather, the, position, of, certain, wildlife, species, or, the, size, of, waves, to, find, the, path, from, one, island, to, another, maritime, navigation, using, scientific, instruments, such, as, the, mariner, s, astrolabe, first, occurred, in, the, mediterranean, during, the, middle, ages, although, land, astrolabes, were, invented, in, the, hellenistic, period, and, existed, in, classical, antiquity, and, the, islamic, golden, age, the, oldest, record, of, a, sea, astrolabe, is, that, of, spanish, astronomer, ramon, llull, dating, from, 1295, the, perfecting, of, this, navigation, instrument, is, attributed, to, portuguese, navigators, during, early, portuguese, discoveries, in, the, age, of, discovery, the, earliest, known, description, of, how, to, make, and, use, a, sea, astrolabe, comes, from, spanish, cosmographer, mart, n, cort, s, de, albacar, s, arte, de, navegar, the, art, of, navigation, published, in, 1551, based, on, the, principle, of, the, archipendulum, used, in, constructing, the, egyptian, pyramids, open, seas, navigation, using, the, astrolabe, and, the, compass, started, during, the, age, of, discovery, in, the, 15th, century, the, portuguese, began, systematically, exploring, the, atlantic, coast, of, africa, from, 1418, under, the, sponsorship, of, prince, henry, in, 1488, bartolomeu, dias, reached, the, indian, ocean, by, this, route, in, 1492, the, spanish, monarchs, funded, christopher, columbus, s, expedition, to, sail, west, to, reach, the, indies, by, crossing, the, atlantic, which, resulted, in, the, discovery, of, the, americas, in, 1498, a, portuguese, expedition, commanded, by, vasco, da, gama, reached, india, by, sailing, around, africa, opening, up, direct, trade, with, asia, soon, the, portuguese, sailed, further, eastward, to, the, spice, islands, in, 1512, landing, in, china, one, year, later, the, first, circumnavigation, of, the, earth, was, completed, in, 1522, with, the, magellan, elcano, expedition, a, spanish, voyage, of, discovery, led, by, portuguese, explorer, ferdinand, magellan, and, completed, by, spanish, navigator, juan, sebasti, n, elcano, after, the, former, s, death, in, the, philippines, in, 1521, the, fleet, of, seven, ships, sailed, from, sanl, car, de, barrameda, in, southern, spain, in, 1519, crossed, the, atlantic, ocean, and, after, several, stopovers, rounded, the, southern, tip, of, south, america, some, ships, were, lost, but, the, remaining, fleet, continued, across, the, pacific, making, a, number, of, discoveries, including, guam, and, the, philippines, by, then, only, two, galleons, were, left, from, the, original, seven, the, victoria, led, by, elcano, sailed, across, the, indian, ocean, and, north, along, the, coast, of, africa, to, finally, arrive, in, spain, in, 1522, three, years, after, its, departure, the, trinidad, sailed, east, from, the, philippines, trying, to, find, a, maritime, path, back, to, the, americas, but, was, unsuccessful, the, eastward, route, across, the, pacific, also, known, as, the, tornaviaje, return, trip, was, only, discovered, forty, years, later, when, spanish, cosmographer, andr, s, de, urdaneta, sailed, from, the, philippines, north, to, parallel, 39, and, hit, the, eastward, kuroshio, current, which, took, its, galleon, across, the, pacific, he, arrived, in, acapulco, on, october, 8, 1565, the, term, stems, from, the, 1530s, from, latin, navigationem, nom, navigatio, from, navigatus, pp, of, navigare, to, sail, sail, over, go, by, sea, steer, a, ship, from, navis, ship, and, the, root, of, agere, to, drive, roughly, the, latitude, of, a, place, on, earth, is, its, angular, distance, north, or, south, of, the, equator, latitude, is, usually, expressed, in, degrees, marked, with, ranging, from, 0, at, the, equator, to, 90, at, the, north, and, south, poles, the, latitude, of, the, north, pole, is, 90, n, and, the, latitude, of, the, south, pole, is, 90, s, mariners, calculated, latitude, in, the, northern, hemisphere, by, sighting, the, pole, star, polaris, with, a, sextant, and, using, sight, reduction, tables, to, correct, for, height, of, eye, and, atmospheric, refraction, the, height, of, polaris, in, degrees, above, the, horizon, is, the, latitude, of, the, observer, within, a, degree, or, so, similar, to, latitude, the, longitude, of, a, place, on, earth, is, the, angular, distance, east, or, west, of, the, prime, meridian, or, greenwich, meridian, longitude, is, usually, expressed, in, degrees, marked, with, ranging, from, 0, at, the, greenwich, meridian, to, 180, east, and, west, sydney, for, example, has, a, longitude, of, about, 151, east, new, york, city, has, a, longitude, of, 74, west, for, most, of, history, mariners, struggled, to, determine, longitude, longitude, can, be, calculated, if, the, precise, time, of, a, sighting, is, known, lacking, that, one, can, use, a, sextant, to, take, a, lunar, distance, also, called, the, lunar, observation, or, lunar, for, short, that, with, a, nautical, almanac, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, time, at, zero, longitude, see, greenwich, mean, time, reliable, marine, chronometers, were, unavailable, until, the, late, 18th, century, and, not, affordable, until, the, 19th, century, for, about, a, hundred, years, from, about, 1767, until, about, 1850, mariners, lacking, a, chronometer, used, the, method, of, lunar, distances, to, determine, greenwich, time, to, find, their, longitude, a, mariner, with, a, chronometer, could, check, its, reading, using, a, lunar, determination, of, greenwich, time, in, navigation, a, rhumb, line, or, loxodrome, is, a, line, crossing, all, meridians, of, longitude, at, the, same, angle, i, e, a, path, derived, from, a, defined, initial, bearing, that, is, upon, taking, an, initial, bearing, one, proceeds, along, the, same, bearing, without, changing, the, direction, as, measured, relative, to, true, or, magnetic, north, most, modern, navigation, relies, primarily, on, positions, determined, electronically, by, receivers, collecting, information, from, satellites, most, other, modern, techniques, rely, on, finding, intersecting, lines, of, position, or, lop, a, line, of, position, can, refer, to, two, different, things, either, a, line, on, a, chart, or, a, line, between, the, observer, and, an, object, in, real, life, a, bearing, is, a, measure, of, the, direction, to, an, object, if, the, navigator, measures, the, direction, in, real, life, the, angle, can, then, be, drawn, on, a, nautical, chart, and, the, navigator, will, be, somewhere, on, that, bearing, line, on, the, chart, in, addition, to, bearings, navigators, also, often, measure, distances, to, objects, on, the, chart, a, distance, produces, a, circle, or, arc, of, position, circles, arcs, and, hyperbolae, of, positions, are, often, referred, to, as, lines, of, position, if, the, navigator, draws, two, lines, of, position, and, they, intersect, he, must, be, at, that, position, a, fix, is, the, intersection, of, two, or, more, lops, if, only, one, line, of, position, is, available, this, may, be, evaluated, against, the, dead, reckoning, position, to, establish, an, estimated, position, lines, or, circles, of, position, can, be, derived, from, a, variety, of, sources, there, are, some, methods, seldom, used, today, such, as, dipping, a, light, to, calculate, the, geographic, range, from, observer, to, lighthouse, methods, of, navigation, have, changed, through, history, each, new, method, has, enhanced, the, mariner, s, ability, to, complete, his, voyage, one, of, the, most, important, judgments, the, navigator, must, make, is, the, best, method, to, use, some, types, of, navigation, are, depicted, in, the, table, the, practice, of, navigation, usually, involves, a, combination, of, these, different, methods, by, mental, navigation, checks, a, pilot, or, a, navigator, estimates, tracks, distances, and, altitudes, which, will, then, help, the, pilot, avoid, gross, navigation, errors, piloting, also, called, pilotage, involves, navigating, an, aircraft, by, visual, reference, to, landmarks, or, a, water, vessel, in, restricted, waters, and, fixing, its, position, as, precisely, as, possible, at, frequent, intervals, more, so, than, in, other, phases, of, navigation, proper, preparation, and, attention, to, detail, are, important, procedures, vary, from, vessel, to, vessel, and, between, military, commercial, and, private, vessels, as, pilotage, takes, place, in, shallow, waters, it, typically, involves, following, courses, to, ensure, sufficient, under, keel, clearance, ensuring, a, sufficient, depth, of, water, below, the, hull, as, well, as, a, consideration, for, squat, it, may, also, involve, navigating, a, ship, within, a, river, canal, or, channel, in, close, proximity, to, land, a, military, navigation, team, will, nearly, always, consist, of, several, people, a, military, navigator, might, have, bearing, takers, stationed, at, the, gyro, repeaters, on, the, bridge, wings, for, taking, simultaneous, bearings, while, the, civilian, navigator, on, a, merchant, ship, or, leisure, craft, must, often, take, and, plot, their, position, themselves, typically, with, the, aid, of, electronic, position, fixing, while, the, military, navigator, will, have, a, bearing, book, and, someone, to, record, entries, for, each, fix, the, civilian, navigator, will, simply, pilot, the, bearings, on, the, chart, as, they, are, taken, and, not, record, them, at, all, if, the, ship, is, equipped, with, an, ecdis, it, is, reasonable, for, the, navigator, to, simply, monitor, the, progress, of, the, ship, along, the, chosen, track, visually, ensuring, that, the, ship, is, proceeding, as, desired, checking, the, compass, sounder, and, other, indicators, only, occasionally, if, a, pilot, is, aboard, as, is, often, the, case, in, the, most, restricted, of, waters, his, judgement, can, generally, be, relied, upon, further, easing, the, workload, but, should, the, ecdis, fail, the, navigator, will, have, to, rely, on, his, skill, in, the, manual, and, time, tested, procedures, celestial, navigation, systems, are, based, on, observation, of, the, positions, of, the, sun, moon, planets, and, navigational, stars, such, systems, are, in, use, as, well, for, terrestrial, navigating, as, for, interstellar, navigating, by, knowing, which, point, on, the, rotating, earth, a, celestial, object, is, above, and, measuring, its, height, above, the, observer, s, horizon, the, navigator, can, determine, his, distance, from, that, subpoint, a, nautical, almanac, and, a, marine, chronometer, are, used, to, compute, the, subpoint, on, earth, a, celestial, body, is, over, and, a, sextant, is, used, to, measure, the, body, s, angular, height, above, the, horizon, that, height, can, then, be, used, to, compute, distance, from, the, subpoint, to, create, a, circular, line, of, position, a, navigator, shoots, a, number, of, stars, in, succession, to, give, a, series, of, overlapping, lines, of, position, where, they, intersect, is, the, celestial, fix, the, moon, and, sun, may, also, be, used, the, sun, can, also, be, used, by, itself, to, shoot, a, succession, of, lines, of, position, best, done, around, local, noon, to, determine, a, position, in, order, to, accurately, measure, longitude, the, precise, time, of, a, sextant, sighting, down, to, the, second, if, possible, must, be, recorded, each, second, of, error, is, equivalent, to, 15, seconds, of, longitude, error, which, at, the, equator, is, a, position, error, of, 25, of, a, nautical, mile, about, the, accuracy, limit, of, manual, celestial, navigation, the, spring, driven, marine, chronometer, is, a, precision, timepiece, used, aboard, ship, to, provide, accurate, time, for, celestial, observations, a, chronometer, differs, from, a, spring, driven, watch, principally, in, that, it, contains, a, variable, lever, device, to, maintain, even, pressure, on, the, mainspring, and, a, special, balance, designed, to, compensate, for, temperature, variations, a, spring, driven, chronometer, is, set, approximately, to, greenwich, mean, time, gmt, and, is, not, reset, until, the, instrument, is, overhauled, and, cleaned, usually, at, three, year, intervals, the, difference, between, gmt, and, chronometer, time, is, carefully, determined, and, applied, as, a, correction, to, all, chronometer, readings, spring, driven, chronometers, must, be, wound, at, about, the, same, time, each, day, quartz, crystal, marine, chronometers, have, replaced, spring, driven, chronometers, aboard, many, ships, because, of, their, greater, accuracy, they, are, maintained, on, gmt, directly, from, radio, time, signals, this, eliminates, chronometer, error, and, watch, error, corrections, should, the, second, hand, be, in, error, by, a, readable, amount, it, can, be, reset, electrically, the, basic, element, for, time, generation, is, a, quartz, crystal, oscillator, the, quartz, crystal, is, temperature, compensated, and, is, hermetically, sealed, in, an, evacuated, envelope, a, calibrated, adjustment, capability, is, provided, to, adjust, for, the, aging, of, the, crystal, the, chronometer, is, designed, to, operate, for, a, minimum, of, one, year, on, a, single, set, of, batteries, observations, may, be, timed, and, ship, s, clocks, set, with, a, comparing, watch, which, is, set, to, chronometer, time, and, taken, to, the, bridge, wing, for, recording, sight, times, in, practice, a, wrist, watch, coordinated, to, the, nearest, second, with, the, chronometer, will, be, adequate, a, stop, watch, either, spring, wound, or, digital, may, also, be, used, for, celestial, observations, in, this, case, the, watch, is, started, at, a, known, gmt, by, chronometer, and, the, elapsed, time, of, each, sight, added, to, this, to, obtain, gmt, of, the, sight, all, chronometers, and, watches, should, be, checked, regularly, with, a, radio, time, signal, times, and, frequencies, of, radio, time, signals, are, listed, in, publications, such, as, radio, navigational, aids, the, second, critical, component, of, celestial, navigation, is, to, measure, the, angle, formed, at, the, observer, s, eye, between, the, celestial, body, and, the, sensible, horizon, the, sextant, an, optical, instrument, is, used, to, perform, this, function, the, sextant, consists, of, two, primary, assemblies, the, frame, is, a, rigid, triangular, structure, with, a, pivot, at, the, top, and, a, graduated, segment, of, a, circle, referred, to, as, the, arc, at, the, bottom, the, second, component, is, the, index, arm, which, is, attached, to, the, pivot, at, the, top, of, the, frame, at, the, bottom, is, an, endless, vernier, which, clamps, into, teeth, on, the, bottom, of, the, arc, the, optical, system, consists, of, two, mirrors, and, generally, a, low, power, telescope, one, mirror, referred, to, as, the, index, mirror, is, fixed, to, the, top, of, the, index, arm, over, the, pivot, as, the, index, arm, is, moved, this, mirror, rotates, and, the, graduated, scale, on, the, arc, indicates, the, measured, angle, altitude, the, second, mirror, referred, to, as, the, horizon, glass, is, fixed, to, the, front, of, the, frame, one, half, of, the, horizon, glass, is, silvered, and, the, other, half, is, clear, light, from, the, celestial, body, strikes, the, index, mirror, and, is, reflected, to, the, silvered, portion, of, the, horizon, glass, then, back, to, the, observer, s, eye, through, the, telescope, the, observer, manipulates, the, index, arm, so, the, reflected, image, of, the, body, in, the, horizon, glass, is, just, resting, on, the, visual, horizon, seen, through, the, clear, side, of, the, horizon, glass, adjustment, of, the, sextant, consists, of, checking, and, aligning, all, the, optical, elements, to, eliminate, index, correction, index, correction, should, be, checked, using, the, horizon, or, more, preferably, a, star, each, time, the, sextant, is, used, the, practice, of, taking, celestial, observations, from, the, deck, of, a, rolling, ship, often, through, cloud, cover, and, with, a, hazy, horizon, is, by, far, the, most, challenging, part, of, celestial, navigation, inertial, navigation, system, ins, is, a, dead, reckoning, type, of, navigation, system, that, computes, its, position, based, on, motion, sensors, before, actually, navigating, the, initial, latitude, and, longitude, and, the, ins, s, physical, orientation, relative, to, the, earth, e, g, north, and, level, are, established, after, alignment, an, ins, receives, impulses, from, motion, detectors, that, measure, a, the, acceleration, along, three, axes, accelerometers, and, b, rate, of, rotation, about, three, orthogonal, axes, gyroscopes, these, enable, an, ins, to, continually, and, accurately, calculate, its, current, latitude, and, longitude, and, often, velocity, advantages, over, other, navigation, systems, are, that, once, aligned, an, ins, does, not, require, outside, information, an, ins, is, not, affected, by, adverse, weather, conditions, and, it, cannot, be, detected, or, jammed, its, disadvantage, is, that, since, the, current, position, is, calculated, solely, from, previous, positions, and, motion, sensors, its, errors, are, cumulative, increasing, at, a, rate, roughly, proportional, to, the, time, since, the, initial, position, was, input, inertial, navigation, systems, must, therefore, be, frequently, corrected, with, a, location, fix, from, some, other, type, of, navigation, system, the, first, inertial, system, is, considered, to, be, the, v, 2, guidance, system, deployed, by, the, germans, in, 1942, however, inertial, sensors, are, traced, to, the, early, 19th, century, the, advantages, inss, led, their, use, in, aircraft, missiles, surface, ships, and, submarines, for, example, the, u, s, navy, developed, the, ships, inertial, navigation, system, sins, during, the, polaris, missile, program, to, ensure, a, reliable, and, accurate, navigation, system, to, initial, its, missile, guidance, systems, inertial, navigation, systems, were, in, wide, use, until, satellite, navigation, systems, gps, became, available, inss, are, still, in, common, use, on, submarines, since, gps, reception, or, other, fix, sources, are, not, possible, while, submerged, and, long, range, missiles, not, to, be, confused, with, satellite, navigation, which, depends, upon, satellites, to, function, space, navigation, refers, to, the, navigation, of, spacecraft, themselves, this, has, historically, been, achieved, during, the, apollo, program, via, a, navigational, computer, an, inertial, navigation, system, and, via, celestial, inputs, entered, by, astronauts, which, were, recorded, by, sextant, and, telescope, space, rated, navigational, computers, like, those, found, on, apollo, and, later, missions, are, designed, to, be, hardened, against, possible, data, corruption, from, radiation, another, possibility, that, has, been, explored, for, deep, space, navigation, is, pulsar, navigation, which, compares, the, x, ray, bursts, from, a, collection, of, known, pulsars, in, order, to, determine, the, position, of, a, spacecraft, this, method, has, been, tested, by, multiple, space, agencies, such, as, nasa, and, esa, a, radio, direction, finder, or, rdf, is, a, device, for, finding, the, direction, to, a, radio, source, due, to, radio, s, ability, to, travel, very, long, distances, over, the, horizon, it, makes, a, particularly, good, navigation, system, for, ships, and, aircraft, that, might, be, flying, at, a, distance, from, land, rdfs, works, by, rotating, a, directional, antenna, and, listening, for, the, direction, in, which, the, signal, from, a, known, station, comes, through, most, strongly, this, sort, of, system, was, widely, used, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, rdf, antennas, are, easy, to, spot, on, german, world, war, ii, aircraft, as, loops, under, the, rear, section, of, the, fuselage, whereas, most, us, aircraft, enclosed, the, antenna, in, a, small, teardrop, shaped, fairing, in, navigational, applications, rdf, signals, are, provided, in, the, form, of, radio, beacons, the, radio, version, of, a, lighthouse, the, signal, is, typically, a, simple, am, broadcast, of, a, morse, code, series, of, letters, which, the, rdf, can, tune, in, to, see, if, the, beacon, is, on, the, air, most, modern, detectors, can, also, tune, in, any, commercial, radio, stations, which, is, particularly, useful, due, to, their, high, power, and, location, near, major, cities, decca, omega, and, loran, c, are, three, similar, hyperbolic, navigation, systems, decca, was, a, hyperbolic, low, frequency, radio, navigation, system, also, known, as, multilateration, that, was, first, deployed, during, world, war, ii, when, the, allied, forces, needed, a, system, which, could, be, used, to, achieve, accurate, landings, as, was, the, case, with, loran, c, its, primary, use, was, for, ship, navigation, in, coastal, waters, fishing, vessels, were, major, post, war, users, but, it, was, also, used, on, aircraft, including, a, very, early, 1949, application, of, moving, map, displays, the, system, was, deployed, in, the, north, sea, and, was, used, by, helicopters, operating, to, oil, platforms, the, omega, navigation, system, was, the, first, truly, global, radio, navigation, system, for, aircraft, operated, by, the, united, states, in, cooperation, with, six, partner, nations, omega, was, developed, by, the, united, states, navy, for, military, aviation, users, it, was, approved, for, development, in, 1968, and, promised, a, true, worldwide, oceanic, coverage, capability, with, only, eight, transmitters, and, the, ability, to, achieve, a, four, mile, 6, km, accuracy, when, fixing, a, position, initially, the, system, was, to, be, used, for, navigating, nuclear, bombers, across, the, north, pole, to, russia, later, it, was, found, useful, for, submarines, omega, due, to, the, success, of, the, global, positioning, system, the, use, of, omega, declined, during, the, 1990s, to, a, point, where, the, cost, of, operating, omega, could, no, longer, be, justified, omega, was, terminated, on, september, 30, 1997, and, all, stations, ceased, operation, loran, is, a, terrestrial, navigation, system, using, low, frequency, radio, transmitters, that, use, the, time, interval, between, radio, signals, received, from, three, or, more, stations, to, determine, the, position, of, a, ship, or, aircraft, the, current, version, of, loran, in, common, use, is, loran, c, which, operates, in, the, low, frequency, portion, of, the, em, spectrum, from, 90, to, 110, khz, many, nations, are, users, of, the, system, including, the, united, states, japan, and, several, european, countries, russia, uses, a, nearly, exact, system, in, the, same, frequency, range, called, chayka, loran, use, is, in, steep, decline, with, gps, being, the, primary, replacement, however, there, are, attempts, to, enhance, and, re, popularize, loran, loran, signals, are, less, susceptible, to, interference, and, can, penetrate, better, into, foliage, and, buildings, than, gps, signals, radar, is, an, effective, aid, to, navigation, because, it, provides, ranges, and, bearings, to, objects, within, range, of, the, radar, scanner, when, a, vessel, ship, or, boat, is, within, radar, range, of, land, or, fixed, objects, such, as, special, radar, aids, to, navigation, and, navigation, marks, the, navigator, can, take, distances, and, angular, bearings, to, charted, objects, and, use, these, to, establish, arcs, of, position, and, lines, of, position, on, a, chart, a, fix, consisting, of, only, radar, information, is, called, a, radar, fix, types, of, radar, fixes, include, range, and, bearing, to, a, single, object, two, or, more, bearings, tangent, bearings, and, two, or, more, ranges, radar, can, also, be, used, with, ecdis, as, a, means, of, position, fixing, with, the, radar, image, or, distance, bearing, overlaid, onto, an, electronic, nautical, chart, parallel, indexing, is, a, technique, defined, by, william, burger, in, the, 1957, book, the, radar, observer, s, handbook, this, technique, involves, creating, a, line, on, the, screen, that, is, parallel, to, the, ship, s, course, but, offset, to, the, left, or, right, by, some, distance, this, parallel, line, allows, the, navigator, to, maintain, a, given, distance, away, from, hazards, the, line, on, the, radar, screen, is, set, to, a, specific, distance, and, angle, then, the, ship, s, position, relative, to, the, parallel, line, is, observed, this, can, provide, an, immediate, reference, to, the, navigator, as, to, whether, the, ship, is, on, or, off, its, intended, course, for, navigation, other, techniques, that, are, less, used, in, general, navigation, have, been, developed, for, special, situations, one, known, as, the, contour, method, involves, marking, a, transparent, plastic, template, on, the, radar, screen, and, moving, it, to, the, chart, to, fix, a, position, another, special, technique, known, as, the, franklin, continuous, radar, plot, technique, involves, drawing, the, path, a, radar, object, should, follow, on, the, radar, display, if, the, ship, stays, on, its, planned, course, during, the, transit, the, navigator, can, check, that, the, ship, is, on, track, by, checking, that, the, pip, lies, on, the, drawn, line, global, navigation, satellite, system, or, gnss, is, the, term, for, satellite, navigation, systems, that, provide, positioning, with, global, coverage, a, gnss, allow, small, electronic, receivers, to, determine, their, location, longitude, latitude, and, altitude, within, a, few, meters, using, time, signals, transmitted, along, a, line, of, sight, by, radio, from, satellites, receivers, on, the, ground, with, a, fixed, position, can, also, be, used, to, calculate, the, precise, time, as, a, reference, for, scientific, experiments, as, of, october, 2011, only, the, united, states, navstar, global, positioning, system, gps, and, the, russian, glonass, are, fully, globally, operational, gnsss, the, european, union, s, galileo, positioning, system, is, a, next, generation, gnss, in, the, final, deployment, phase, and, became, operational, in, 2016, china, has, indicated, it, may, expand, its, regional, beidou, navigation, system, into, a, global, system, more, than, two, dozen, gps, satellites, are, in, medium, earth, orbit, transmitting, signals, allowing, gps, receivers, to, determine, the, receiver, s, location, speed, and, direction, since, the, first, experimental, satellite, was, launched, in, 1978, gps, has, become, an, indispensable, aid, to, navigation, around, the, world, and, an, important, tool, for, map, making, and, land, surveying, gps, also, provides, a, precise, time, reference, used, in, many, applications, including, scientific, study, of, earthquakes, and, synchronization, of, telecommunications, networks, developed, by, the, united, states, department, of, defense, gps, is, officially, named, navstar, gps, navigation, satellite, timing, and, ranging, global, positioning, system, the, satellite, constellation, is, managed, by, the, united, states, air, force, 50th, space, wing, the, cost, of, maintaining, the, system, is, approximately, us, 750, million, per, year, including, the, replacement, of, aging, satellites, and, research, and, development, despite, this, fact, gps, is, free, for, civilian, use, as, a, public, good, modern, smartphones, act, as, personal, gps, navigators, for, civilians, who, own, them, overuse, of, these, devices, whether, in, the, vehicle, or, on, foot, can, lead, to, a, relative, inability, to, learn, about, navigated, environments, resulting, in, sub, optimal, navigation, abilities, when, and, if, these, devices, become, unavailable, typically, a, compass, is, also, provided, to, determine, direction, when, not, moving, the, day, s, work, in, navigation, is, a, minimal, set, of, tasks, consistent, with, prudent, navigation, the, definition, will, vary, on, military, and, civilian, vessels, and, from, ship, to, ship, but, the, traditional, method, takes, a, form, resembling, navigation, on, ships, is, usually, always, conducted, on, the, bridge, it, may, also, take, place, in, adjacent, space, where, chart, tables, and, publications, are, available, passage, planning, or, voyage, planning, is, a, procedure, to, develop, a, complete, description, of, vessel, s, voyage, from, start, to, finish, the, plan, includes, leaving, the, dock, and, harbor, area, the, en, route, portion, of, a, voyage, approaching, the, destination, and, mooring, according, to, international, law, a, vessel, s, captain, is, legally, responsible, for, passage, planning, however, on, larger, vessels, the, task, will, be, delegated, to, the, ship, s, navigator, studies, show, that, human, error, is, a, factor, in, 80, percent, of, navigational, accidents, and, that, in, many, cases, the, human, making, the, error, had, access, to, information, that, could, have, prevented, the, accident, the, practice, of, voyage, planning, has, evolved, from, penciling, lines, on, nautical, charts, to, a, process, of, risk, management, passage, planning, consists, of, four, stages, appraisal, planning, execution, and, monitoring, which, are, specified, in, international, maritime, organization, resolution, a, 893, 21, guidelines, for, voyage, planning, and, these, guidelines, are, reflected, in, the, local, laws, of, imo, signatory, countries, for, example, title, 33, of, the, u, s, code, of, federal, regulations, and, a, number, of, professional, books, or, publications, there, are, some, fifty, elements, of, a, comprehensive, passage, plan, depending, on, the, size, and, type, of, vessel, the, appraisal, stage, deals, with, the, collection, of, information, relevant, to, the, proposed, voyage, as, well, as, ascertaining, risks, and, assessing, the, key, features, of, the, voyage, this, will, involve, considering, the, type, of, navigation, required, e, g, ice, navigation, the, region, the, ship, will, be, passing, through, and, the, hydrographic, information, on, the, route, in, the, next, stage, the, written, plan, is, created, the, third, stage, is, the, execution, of, the, finalised, voyage, plan, taking, into, account, any, special, circumstances, which, may, arise, such, as, changes, in, the, weather, which, may, require, the, plan, to, be, reviewed, or, altered, the, final, stage, of, passage, planning, consists, of, monitoring, the, vessel, s, progress, in, relation, to, the, plan, and, responding, to, deviations, and, unforeseen, circumstances, electronic, integrated, bridge, concepts, are, driving, future, navigation, system, planning, integrated, systems, take, inputs, from, various, ship, sensors, electronically, display, positioning, information, and, provide, control, signals, required, to, maintain, a, vessel, on, a, preset, course, the, navigator, becomes, a, system, manager, choosing, system, presets, interpreting, system, output, and, monitoring, vessel, response, navigation, for, cars, and, other, land, based, travel, typically, uses, maps, landmarks, and, in, recent, times, computer, navigation, satnav, short, for, satellite, navigation, as, well, as, any, means, available, on, water, computerized, navigation, commonly, relies, on, gps, for, current, location, information, a, navigational, map, database, of, roads, and, navigable, routes, and, uses, algorithms, related, to, the, shortest, path, problem, to, identify, optimal, routes, pedestrian, navigation, is, involved, in, orienteering, land, navigation, military, and, wayfinding, professional, standards, for, navigation, depend, on, the, type, of, navigation, and, vary, by, country, for, marine, navigation, merchant, navy, deck, officers, are, trained, and, internationally, certified, according, to, the, stcw, convention, leisure, and, amateur, mariners, may, undertake, lessons, in, navigation, at, local, regional, training, schools, naval, officers, receive, navigation, training, as, part, of, their, naval, training, in, land, navigation, courses, and, training, is, often, provided, to, young, persons, as, part, of, general, or, extra, curricular, education, land, navigation, is, also, an, essential, part, of, army, training, additionally, organisations, such, as, the, scouts, and, doe, programme, teach, navigation, to, their, students, orienteering, organisations, are, a, type, of, sports, that, require, navigational, skills, using, a, map, and, compass, to, navigate, from, point, to, point, in, diverse, and, usually, unfamiliar, terrain, whilst, moving, at, speed, in, aviation, pilots, undertake, air, navigation, training, as, part, of, learning, to, fly, professional, organisations, also, assist, to, encourage, improvements, in, navigation, or, bring, together, navigators, in, learned, environments, the, royal, institute, of, navigation, rin, is, a, learned, society, with, charitable, status, aimed, at, furthering, the, development, of, navigation, on, land, and, sea, in, the, air, and, in, space, it, was, founded, in, 1947, as, a, forum, for, mariners, pilots, engineers, and, academics, to, compare, their, experiences, and, exchange, information, in, the, us, the, institute, of, navigation, ion, is, a, non, profit, professional, organisation, advancing, the, art, and, science, of, positioning, navigation, and, timing, numerous, nautical, publications, are, available, on, navigation, which, are, published, by, professional, sources, all, over, the, world, in, the, uk, the, united, kingdom, hydrographic, office, the, witherby, publishing, group, and, the, nautical, institute, provide, numerous, navigational, publications, including, the, comprehensive, admiralty, manual, of, navigation, in, the, us, bowditch, s, american, practical, navigator, is, a, free, available, encyclopedia, of, navigation, issued, by, the, us, government, navigation, is, an, essential, everyday, activity, that, involves, a, series, of, abilities, that, help, humans, and, animals, to, locate, track, and, follow, paths, in, order, to, arrive, at, different, destinations, navigation, in, spatial, cognition, allows, for, acquiring, information, about, the, environment, by, using, the, body, and, landmarks, of, the, environment, as, frames, of, references, to, create, mental, representations, of, our, environment, also, known, as, a, cognitive, map, humans, navigate, by, transitioning, between, different, spaces, and, coordinating, both, egocentric, and, allocentric, frames, of, reference, navigation, can, be, distinguished, into, two, sptial, components, locomotion, and, wayfinding, locomotion, is, the, process, of, movement, from, one, place, to, another, both, in, humans, and, in, animals, locomotion, helps, you, understand, an, environment, by, moving, through, a, space, in, order, to, create, a, mental, representation, of, it, wayfinding, is, defined, as, an, active, process, of, following, or, deciding, upon, a, path, between, one, place, to, another, through, mental, representations, it, involves, processes, such, as, representation, planning, and, decision, which, help, to, avoid, obstacles, to, stay, on, course, or, to, regulate, pace, when, approaching, particular, objects, navigation, and, wayfinding, can, be, approached, in, the, environmental, space, according, to, dan, montello, s, space, classification, there, are, four, levels, of, space, with, the, third, being, the, environmental, space, the, environmental, space, represents, a, very, large, space, like, a, city, and, can, only, be, fully, explored, through, movement, since, all, objects, and, space, are, not, directly, visible, also, barbara, tversky, systematized, the, space, but, this, time, taking, into, consideration, the, three, dimensions, that, correspond, to, the, axes, of, the, human, body, and, its, extensions, above, below, front, back, and, left, right, tversky, ultimately, proposed, a, fourfold, classification, of, navigable, space, space, of, the, body, space, around, the, body, space, of, navigation, and, space, of, graphics, there, are, two, types, of, wayfinding, in, navigation, aided, and, unaided, aided, wayfinding, requires, a, person, to, use, various, types, of, media, such, as, maps, gps, directional, signage, etc, in, their, navigation, process, which, generally, involves, low, spatial, reasoning, and, is, less, cognitively, demanding, unaided, wayfinding, involves, no, such, devices, for, the, person, who, is, navigating, unaided, wayfinding, can, be, subdivided, into, a, taxonomy, of, tasks, depending, on, whether, it, is, undirected, or, directed, which, basically, makes, the, distinction, of, whether, there, is, a, precise, destination, or, not, undirected, wayfinding, means, that, a, person, is, simply, exploring, an, environment, for, pleasure, without, any, set, destination, directed, wayfinding, instead, can, be, further, subdivided, into, search, vs, target, approximation, search, means, that, a, person, does, not, know, where, the, destination, is, located, and, must, find, it, either, in, an, unfamiliar, environment, which, is, labeled, as, an, uninformed, search, or, in, a, familiar, environment, labeled, as, an, informed, search, in, target, approximation, on, the, other, hand, the, location, of, the, destination, is, known, to, the, navigator, but, a, further, distinction, is, made, based, on, whether, the, navigator, knows, how, to, arrive, or, not, to, the, destination, path, following, means, that, the, environment, the, path, and, the, destination, are, all, known, which, means, that, the, navigator, simply, follows, the, path, they, already, know, and, arrive, at, the, destination, without, much, thought, for, example, when, you, are, in, your, city, and, walking, on, the, same, path, as, you, normally, take, from, your, house, to, your, job, or, university, however, path, finding, means, that, the, navigator, knows, where, the, destination, is, but, does, not, know, the, route, they, have, to, take, to, arrive, at, the, destination, you, know, where, a, specific, store, is, but, you, do, not, know, how, to, arrive, there, or, what, path, to, take, if, the, navigator, does, not, know, the, environment, it, is, called, path, search, which, means, that, only, the, destination, is, known, while, neither, the, path, nor, the, environment, is, you, are, in, a, new, city, and, need, to, arrive, at, the, train, station, but, do, not, know, how, to, get, there, path, planning, on, the, other, hand, means, that, the, navigator, knows, both, where, the, destination, is, and, is, familiar, with, the, environment, so, they, only, need, to, plan, the, route, or, path, that, they, should, take, to, arrive, at, their, target, for, example, if, you, are, in, your, city, and, need, to, get, to, a, specific, store, that, you, know, the, destination, of, but, do, not, know, the, specific, path, you, need, to, take, to, get, there
