a, lock, is, a, mechanical, or, electronic, fastening, device, that, is, released, by, a, physical, object, such, as, a, key, keycard, fingerprint, rfid, card, security, token, or, coin, by, supplying, secret, information, such, as, a, number, or, letter, permutation, or, password, by, a, combination, thereof, or, it, may, only, be, able, to, be, opened, from, one, side, such, as, a, door, chain, a, key, is, a, device, that, is, used, to, operate, a, lock, to, lock, or, unlock, it, a, typical, key, is, a, small, piece, of, metal, consisting, of, two, parts, the, bit, or, blade, which, slides, into, the, keyway, of, the, lock, and, distinguishes, between, different, keys, and, the, bow, which, is, left, protruding, so, that, torque, can, be, applied, by, the, user, in, its, simplest, implementation, a, key, operates, one, lock, or, set, of, locks, that, are, keyed, alike, a, lock, key, system, where, each, similarly, keyed, lock, requires, the, same, unique, key, the, key, serves, as, a, security, token, for, access, to, the, locked, area, locks, are, meant, to, only, allow, persons, having, the, correct, key, to, open, it, and, gain, access, in, more, complex, mechanical, lock, key, systems, two, different, keys, one, of, which, is, known, as, the, master, key, serve, to, open, the, lock, common, metals, include, brass, plated, brass, nickel, silver, and, steel, the, act, of, opening, a, lock, without, a, key, is, called, lock, picking, locks, have, been, in, use, for, over, 6000, years, with, one, early, example, discovered, in, the, ruins, of, nineveh, the, capital, of, ancient, assyria, locks, such, as, this, were, developed, into, the, egyptian, wooden, pin, lock, which, consisted, of, a, bolt, door, fixture, or, attachment, and, key, when, the, key, was, inserted, pins, within, the, fixture, were, lifted, out, of, drilled, holes, within, the, bolt, allowing, it, to, move, when, the, key, was, removed, the, pins, fell, part, way, into, the, bolt, preventing, movement, the, warded, lock, was, also, present, from, antiquity, and, remains, the, most, recognizable, lock, and, key, design, in, the, western, world, the, first, all, metal, locks, appeared, between, the, years, 870, and, 900, and, are, attributed, to, english, craftsmen, it, is, also, said, that, the, key, was, invented, by, theodorus, of, samos, in, the, 6th, century, bc, the, romans, invented, metal, locks, and, keys, and, the, system, of, security, provided, by, wards, affluent, romans, often, kept, their, valuables, in, secure, locked, boxes, within, their, households, and, wore, the, keys, as, rings, on, their, fingers, the, practice, had, two, benefits, it, kept, the, key, handy, at, all, times, while, signaling, that, the, wearer, was, wealthy, and, important, enough, to, have, money, and, jewellery, worth, securing, a, special, type, of, lock, dating, back, to, the, 17th, 18th, century, although, potentially, older, as, similar, locks, date, back, to, the, 14th, century, can, be, found, in, the, beguinage, of, the, belgian, city, lier, these, locks, are, most, likely, gothic, locks, that, were, decorated, with, foliage, often, in, a, v, shape, surrounding, the, keyhole, they, are, often, called, drunk, man, s, lock, as, these, locks, were, according, to, certain, sources, designed, in, such, a, way, a, person, can, still, find, the, keyhole, in, the, dark, although, this, might, not, be, the, case, as, the, ornaments, might, have, been, purely, aesthetic, in, more, recent, times, similar, locks, have, been, designed, with, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, late, 18th, century, and, the, concomitant, development, of, precision, engineering, and, component, standardization, locks, and, keys, were, manufactured, with, increasing, complexity, and, sophistication, the, lever, tumbler, lock, which, uses, a, set, of, levers, to, prevent, the, bolt, from, moving, in, the, lock, was, invented, by, robert, barron, in, 1778, his, double, acting, lever, lock, required, the, lever, to, be, lifted, to, a, certain, height, by, having, a, slot, cut, in, the, lever, so, lifting, the, lever, too, far, was, as, bad, as, not, lifting, the, lever, far, enough, this, type, of, lock, is, still, used, today, the, lever, tumbler, lock, was, greatly, improved, by, jeremiah, chubb, in, 1818, a, burglary, in, portsmouth, dockyard, prompted, the, british, government, to, announce, a, competition, to, produce, a, lock, that, could, be, opened, only, with, its, own, key, chubb, developed, the, chubb, detector, lock, which, incorporated, an, integral, security, feature, that, could, frustrate, unauthorized, access, attempts, and, would, indicate, to, the, lock, s, owner, if, it, had, been, interfered, with, chubb, was, awarded, 100, after, a, trained, lock, picker, failed, to, break, the, lock, after, 3, months, in, 1820, jeremiah, joined, his, brother, charles, in, starting, their, own, lock, company, chubb, chubb, made, various, improvements, to, his, lock, his, 1824, improved, design, did, not, require, a, special, regulator, key, to, reset, the, lock, by, 1847, his, keys, used, six, levers, rather, than, four, and, he, later, introduced, a, disc, that, allowed, the, key, to, pass, but, narrowed, the, field, of, view, hiding, the, levers, from, anybody, attempting, to, pick, the, lock, the, chubb, brothers, also, received, a, patent, for, the, first, burglar, resisting, safe, and, began, production, in, 1835, the, designs, of, barron, and, chubb, were, based, on, the, use, of, movable, levers, but, joseph, bramah, a, prolific, inventor, developed, an, alternative, method, in, 1784, his, lock, used, a, cylindrical, key, with, precise, notches, along, the, surface, these, moved, the, metal, slides, that, impeded, the, turning, of, the, bolt, into, an, exact, alignment, allowing, the, lock, to, open, the, lock, was, at, the, limits, of, the, precision, manufacturing, capabilities, of, the, time, and, was, said, by, its, inventor, to, be, unpickable, in, the, same, year, bramah, started, the, bramah, locks, company, at, 124, piccadilly, and, displayed, the, challenge, lock, in, the, window, of, his, shop, from, 1790, challenging, the, artist, who, can, make, an, instrument, that, will, pick, or, open, this, lock, for, the, reward, of, 200, the, challenge, stood, for, over, 67, years, until, at, the, great, exhibition, of, 1851, the, american, locksmith, alfred, charles, hobbs, was, able, to, open, the, lock, and, following, some, argument, about, the, circumstances, under, which, he, had, opened, it, was, awarded, the, prize, hobbs, attempt, required, some, 51, hours, spread, over, 16, days, the, earliest, patent, for, a, double, acting, pin, tumbler, lock, was, granted, to, american, physician, abraham, o, stansbury, in, england, in, 1805, but, the, modern, version, still, in, use, today, was, invented, by, american, linus, yale, sr, in, 1848, this, lock, design, used, pins, of, varying, lengths, to, prevent, the, lock, from, opening, without, the, correct, key, in, 1861, linus, yale, jr, was, inspired, by, the, original, 1840s, pin, tumbler, lock, designed, by, his, father, thus, inventing, and, patenting, a, smaller, flat, key, with, serrated, edges, as, well, as, pins, of, varying, lengths, within, the, lock, itself, the, same, design, of, the, pin, tumbler, lock, which, still, remains, in, use, today, the, modern, yale, lock, is, essentially, a, more, developed, version, of, the, egyptian, lock, despite, some, improvement, in, key, design, since, the, majority, of, locks, today, are, still, variants, of, the, designs, invented, by, bramah, chubb, and, yale, a, warded, lock, uses, a, set, of, obstructions, or, wards, to, prevent, the, lock, from, opening, unless, the, correct, key, is, inserted, the, key, has, notches, or, slots, that, correspond, to, the, obstructions, in, the, lock, allowing, it, to, rotate, freely, inside, the, lock, warded, locks, are, typically, reserved, for, low, security, applications, as, a, well, designed, skeleton, key, can, successfully, open, a, wide, variety, of, warded, locks, the, pin, tumbler, lock, uses, a, set, of, pins, to, prevent, the, lock, from, opening, unless, the, correct, key, is, inserted, the, key, has, a, series, of, grooves, on, either, side, of, the, key, s, blade, that, limit, the, type, of, lock, the, key, can, slide, into, as, the, key, slides, into, the, lock, the, horizontal, grooves, on, the, blade, align, with, the, wards, in, the, keyway, allowing, or, denying, entry, to, the, cylinder, a, series, of, pointed, teeth, and, notches, on, the, blade, called, bittings, then, allow, pins, to, move, up, and, down, until, they, are, in, line, with, the, shear, line, of, the, inner, and, outer, cylinder, allowing, the, cylinder, or, cam, to, rotate, freely, and, the, lock, to, open, an, additional, pin, called, the, master, pin, is, present, between, the, key, and, driver, pins, in, locks, that, accept, master, keys, to, allow, the, plug, to, rotate, at, multiple, pin, elevations, a, wafer, tumbler, lock, is, similar, to, the, pin, tumbler, lock, and, works, on, a, similar, principle, however, unlike, the, pin, lock, where, each, pin, consists, of, two, or, more, pieces, each, wafer, is, a, single, piece, the, wafer, tumbler, lock, is, often, incorrectly, referred, to, as, a, disc, tumbler, lock, which, uses, an, entirely, different, mechanism, the, wafer, lock, is, relatively, inexpensive, to, produce, and, is, often, used, in, automobiles, and, cabinetry, the, disc, tumbler, lock, or, abloy, lock, is, composed, of, slotted, rotating, detainer, discs, the, lever, tumbler, lock, uses, a, set, of, levers, to, prevent, the, bolt, from, moving, in, the, lock, in, its, simplest, form, lifting, the, tumbler, above, a, certain, height, will, allow, the, bolt, to, slide, past, lever, locks, are, commonly, recessed, inside, wooden, doors, or, on, some, older, forms, of, padlocks, including, fire, brigade, padlocks, a, magnetic, keyed, lock, is, a, locking, mechanism, whereby, the, key, utilizes, magnets, as, part, of, the, locking, and, unlocking, mechanism, a, magnetic, key, would, use, from, one, to, many, small, magnets, oriented, so, that, the, north, and, south, poles, would, equate, to, a, combination, to, push, or, pull, the, lock, s, internal, tumblers, thus, releasing, the, lock, an, electronic, lock, works, by, means, of, an, electric, current, and, is, usually, connected, to, an, access, control, system, in, addition, to, the, pin, and, tumbler, used, in, standard, locks, electronic, locks, connect, the, bolt, or, cylinder, to, a, motor, within, the, door, using, a, part, called, an, actuator, types, of, electronic, locks, include, the, following, a, keycard, lock, operates, with, a, flat, card, of, similar, dimensions, as, a, credit, card, in, order, to, open, the, door, one, needs, to, successfully, match, the, signature, within, the, keycard, the, lock, in, a, typical, remote, keyless, system, operates, with, a, smart, key, radio, transmitter, the, lock, typically, accepts, a, particular, valid, code, only, once, and, the, smart, key, transmits, a, different, rolling, code, every, time, the, button, is, pressed, generally, the, car, door, can, be, opened, with, either, a, valid, code, by, radio, transmission, or, with, a, non, electronic, pin, tumbler, key, the, ignition, switch, may, require, a, transponder, car, key, to, both, open, a, pin, tumbler, lock, and, also, transmit, a, valid, code, by, radio, transmission, a, smart, lock, is, an, electromechanics, lock, that, gets, instructions, to, lock, and, unlock, the, door, from, an, authorized, device, using, a, cryptographic, key, and, wireless, protocol, smart, locks, have, begun, to, be, used, more, commonly, in, residential, areas, often, controlled, with, smartphones, smart, locks, are, used, in, coworking, spaces, and, offices, to, enable, keyless, office, entry, in, addition, electronic, locks, cannot, be, picked, with, conventional, tools, locksmithing, is, a, traditional, trade, and, in, most, countries, requires, completion, of, an, apprenticeship, the, level, of, formal, education, required, varies, from, country, to, country, from, no, qualifications, required, at, all, in, the, uk, to, a, simple, training, certificate, awarded, by, an, employer, to, a, full, diploma, from, an, engineering, college, locksmiths, may, be, commercial, working, out, of, a, storefront, mobile, working, out, of, a, vehicle, institutional, or, investigational, forensic, locksmiths, they, may, specialize, in, one, aspect, of, the, skill, such, as, an, automotive, lock, specialist, a, master, key, system, specialist, or, a, safe, technician, many, also, act, as, security, consultants, but, not, all, security, consultants, have, the, skills, and, knowledge, of, a, locksmith, historically, locksmiths, constructed, or, repaired, an, entire, lock, including, its, constituent, parts, the, rise, of, cheap, mass, production, has, made, this, less, common, the, vast, majority, of, locks, are, repaired, through, like, for, like, replacements, high, security, safes, and, strongboxes, being, the, most, common, exception, many, locksmiths, also, work, on, any, existing, door, hardware, including, door, closers, hinges, electric, strikes, and, frame, repairs, or, service, electronic, locks, by, making, keys, for, transponder, equipped, vehicles, and, implementing, access, control, systems, although, the, fitting, and, replacement, of, keys, remains, an, important, part, of, locksmithing, modern, locksmiths, are, primarily, involved, in, the, installation, of, high, quality, lock, sets, and, the, design, implementation, and, management, of, keying, and, key, control, systems, locksmiths, are, frequently, required, to, determine, the, level, of, risk, to, an, individual, or, institution, and, then, recommend, and, implement, appropriate, combinations, of, equipment, and, policies, to, create, a, security, layer, that, exceeds, the, reasonable, gain, of, an, intruder, traditional, key, cutting, is, the, primary, method, of, key, duplication, it, is, a, subtractive, process, named, after, the, metalworking, process, of, cutting, where, a, flat, blank, key, is, ground, down, to, form, the, same, shape, as, the, template, original, key, the, process, roughly, follows, these, stages, modern, key, cutting, replaces, the, mechanical, key, following, aspect, with, a, process, in, which, the, original, key, is, scanned, electronically, processed, by, software, stored, then, used, to, guide, a, cutting, wheel, when, a, key, is, produced, the, capability, to, store, electronic, copies, of, the, key, s, shape, allows, for, key, shapes, to, be, stored, for, key, cutting, by, any, party, that, has, access, to, the, key,
