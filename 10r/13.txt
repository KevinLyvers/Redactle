the, agrarian, collectivism, of, the, feudal, age, was, idealized, in, literary, fantasies, of, liberating, regression, to, garden, and, wilderness, following, his, campaign, in, italy, in, 1495, where, he, saw, the, gardens, and, castles, of, naples, king, charles, viii, brought, italian, craftsmen, and, garden, designers, such, as, pacello, da, mercogliano, from, naples, and, ordered, the, construction, of, italian, style, gardens, at, his, residence, at, the, ch, teau, d, amboise, and, at, ch, teau, gaillard, another, private, r, sidence, in, amboise, his, successor, henry, ii, who,

parterres, and, surfaces, of, water, integrated, with, sections, of, greenery, became, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, influential, examples, of, the, classic, french, garden, the, french, formal, garden, french, jardin, la, fran, aise, contrasted, with, the, design, principles, of, the, english, landscape, garden, french, jardin, l, anglaise, namely, to, force, nature, instead, of, leaving, it, undisturbed, typical, french, formal, gardens, had, parterres, geometrical, shapes, and, neatly, clipped, topiary, in, contrast, to, the, english, style, of, garden, in, which, plants, and, shrubs, seem, to, grow, naturally, without, artifice, by, the, mid, 17th, century, axial, symmetry, had, ascended, to, prominence, in, the, french, gardening, traditions, of, andre, mollet, and, jacques, boyceau, from, which, the, latter, wrote, all, things, however, beautiful, they, may, be, chosen, will, be, defective, if, they, are, not, ordered, and, placed, in, proper, symmetry, a, good, example, of, the, french, formal, style, are, the, tuileries, gardens, in, paris, which, were, originally, designed, during, the, reign, of, king, henry, ii, in, the, mid, sixteenth, century, the, gardens, were, redesigned, into, the, formal, french, style, for, the, sun, king, louis, xiv, the, gardens, were, ordered, into, symmetrical, lines, long, rows, of, elm, or, chestnut, trees, clipped, hedgerows, along, with, parterres, reflect, the, orderly, triumph, of, man, s, will, over, nature, the, french, landscape, garden, was, influenced, by, the, english, landscape, garden, and, gained, prominence, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, before, the, grand, manner, era, a, few, significant, gardens, were, found, in, britain, which, were, developed, under, the, influence, of, the, continent, britain, s, homegrown, domestic, gardening, traditions, were, mostly, practical, in, purpose, rather, than, aesthetic, unlike, the, grand, gardens, found, mostly, on, castle, grounds, and, less, commonly, in, universities, tudor, gardens, emphasized, contrast, rather, than, transitions, distinguished, by, color, and, illusion, they, were, not, intended, as, a, complement, to, home, or, architecture, but, conceived, as, independent, spaces, arranged, to, grow, and, display, flowers, and, ornamental, plants, gardeners, demonstrated, their, artistry, in, knot, gardens, with, complex, arrangements, most, commonly, included, interwoven, box, hedges, and, less, commonly, fragrant, herbs, like, rosemary, sanded, paths, run, between, the, hedgings, of, open, knots, whereas, closed, knots, were, filled, with, single, colored, flowers, the, knot, and, parterre, gardens, were, always, placed, on, level, ground, and, elevated, areas, reserved, for, terraces, from, which, the, intricacy, of, the, gardens, could, be, viewed, jacobean, gardens, were, described, as, a, delightful, confusion, by, henry, wotton, in, 1624, under, the, influence, of, the, italian, renaissance, caroline, gardens, began, to, shed, some, of, the, chaos, of, earlier, designs, marking, the, beginning, of, a, trends, towards, symmetrical, unified, designs, that, took, the, building, architecture, into, account, and, featuring, an, elevated, terrace, from, which, home, and, garden, could, be, viewed, the, only, surviving, caroline, garden, is, located, at, bolsover, castle, in, derbyshire, but, is, too, simple, to, attract, much, interest, during, the, reign, of, charles, ii, many, new, baroque, style, country, houses, were, built, while, in, england, oliver, cromwell, sought, to, destroy, many, tudor, jacobean, and, caroline, style, gardens, garden, design, is, the, process, of, creating, plans, for, the, layout, and, planting, of, gardens, and, landscapes, gardens, may, be, designed, by, garden, owners, themselves, or, by, professionals, professional, garden, designers, tend, to, be, trained, in, principles, of, design, and, horticulture, and, have, a, knowledge, and, experience, of, using, plants, some, professional, garden, designers, are, also, landscape, architects, a, more, formal, level, of, training, that, usually, requires, an, advanced, degree, and, often, an, occupational, license, elements, of, garden, design, include, the, layout, of, hard, landscape, such, as, paths, rockeries, walls, water, features, sitting, areas, and, decking, as, well, as, the, plants, themselves, with, consideration, for, their, horticultural, requirements, their, season, to, season, appearance, lifespan, growth, habit, size, speed, of, growth, and, combinations, with, other, plants, and, landscape, features, most, gardens, consist, of, a, mixture, of, natural, and, constructed, elements, although, even, very, natural, gardens, are, always, an, inherently, artificial, creation, natural, elements, present, in, a, garden, principally, comprise, flora, such, as, trees, and, weeds, fauna, such, as, arthropods, and, birds, soil, water, air, and, light, constructed, elements, include, not, only, paths, patios, decking, sculptures, drainage, systems, lights, and, buildings, such, as, sheds, gazebos, pergolas, and, follies, but, also, living, constructions, such, as, flower, beds, ponds, and, lawns, garden, needs, of, maintenance, are, also, taken, into, consideration, including, the, time, or, funds, available, for, regular, maintenance, this, can, affect, the, choices, of, plants, regarding, speed, of, growth, spreading, or, self, seeding, of, the, plants, annual, or, perennial, bloom, time, and, many, other, characteristics, garden, design, can, be, roughly, divided, into, two, groups, formal, and, naturalistic, gardens, the, most, important, consideration, in, any, garden, design, is, how, the, garden, will, be, used, followed, closely, by, the, desired, stylistic, genres, and, the, way, the, garden, space, will, connect, to, the, home, or, other, structures, in, the, surrounding, areas, all, of, these, considerations, are, subject, to, the, budget, limitations, budget, limitations, can, be, addressed, by, a, simpler, garden, style, with, fewer, plants, and, less, costly, hard, landscape, materials, seeds, rather, than, sod, for, lawns, and, plants, that, grow, quickly, alternatively, garden, owners, may, choose, to, create, their, garden, over, time, area, by, area, gardeners, may, cause, environmental, damage, by, the, way, they, garden, or, they, may, enhance, their, local, environment, damage, by, gardeners, can, include, direct, destruction, of, natural, habitats, when, houses, and, gardens, are, created, indirect, habitat, destruction, and, damage, to, provide, garden, materials, such, as, peat, rock, for, rock, gardens, and, by, the, use, of, tapwater, to, irrigate, gardens, the, death, of, living, beings, in, the, garden, itself, such, as, the, killing, not, only, of, slugs, and, snails, but, also, their, predators, such, as, hedgehogs, and, song, thrushes, by, metaldehyde, slug, killer, the, death, of, living, beings, outside, the, garden, such, as, local, species, extinction, by, indiscriminate, plant, collectors, and, climate, change, caused, by, greenhouse, gases, produced, by, gardening, gardeners, can, help, to, prevent, climate, change, in, many, ways, including, the, use, of, trees, shrubs, ground, cover, plants, and, other, perennial, plants, in, their, gardens, turning, garden, waste, into, soil, organic, matter, instead, of, burning, it, keeping, soil, and, compost, heaps, aerated, avoiding, peat, switching, from, power, tools, to, hand, tools, or, changing, their, garden, design, so, that, power, tools, are, not, needed, and, using, nitrogen, fixing, plants, instead, of, nitrogen, fertiliser, climate, change, will, have, many, impacts, on, gardens, some, studies, suggest, most, of, them, will, be, negative, gardens, also, contribute, to, climate, change, greenhouse, gases, can, be, produced, by, gardeners, in, many, ways, the, three, main, greenhouse, gases, are, carbon, dioxide, methane, and, nitrous, oxide, gardeners, produce, carbon, dioxide, directly, by, overcultivating, soil, and, destroying, soil, carbon, by, burning, garden, waste, on, bonfires, by, using, power, tools, which, burn, fossil, fuel, or, use, electricity, generated, by, fossil, fuels, and, by, using, peat, gardeners, produce, methane, by, compacting, the, soil, and, making, it, anaerobic, and, by, allowing, their, compost, heaps, to, become, compacted, and, anaerobic, gardeners, produce, nitrous, oxide, by, applying, excess, nitrogen, fertiliser, when, plants, are, not, actively, growing, so, that, the, nitrogen, in, the, fertiliser, is, converted, by, soil, bacteria, to, nitrous, oxide, some, gardeners, manage, their, gardens, without, using, any, water, from, outside, the, garden, examples, in, britain, include, ventnor, botanic, garden, on, the, isle, of, wight, and, parts, of, beth, chatto, s, garden, in, essex, sticky, wicket, garden, in, dorset, and, the, royal, horticultural, society, s, gardens, at, harlow, carr, and, hyde, hall, rain, gardens, absorb, rainfall, falling, onto, nearby, hard, surfaces, rather, than, sending, it, into, stormwater, drains
