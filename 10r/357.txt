an, axle, or, axletree, is, a, central, shaft, for, a, rotating, wheel, or, gear, on, wheeled, vehicles, the, axle, may, be, fixed, to, the, wheels, rotating, with, them, or, fixed, to, the, vehicle, with, the, wheels, rotating, around, the, axle, in, the, former, case, bearings, or, bushings, are, provided, at, the, mounting, points, where, the, axle, is, supported, in, the, latter, case, a, bearing, or, bushing, sits, inside, a, central, hole, in, the, wheel, to, allow, the, wheel, or, gear, to, rotate, around, the, axle, sometimes, especially, on, bicycles, the, latter, type, of, axle, is, referred, to, as, a, spindle, on, cars, and, trucks, several, senses, of, the, word, axle, occur, in, casual, usage, referring, to, the, shaft, itself, its, housing, or, simply, any, transverse, pair, of, wheels, strictly, speaking, a, shaft, that, rotates, with, the, wheel, being, either, bolted, or, splined, in, fixed, relation, to, it, is, called, an, axle, or, axle, shaft, however, in, looser, usage, an, entire, assembly, including, the, surrounding, axle, housing, typically, a, casting, is, also, called, an, axle, an, even, broader, somewhat, figurative, sense, of, the, word, refers, to, every, pair, of, parallel, wheels, on, opposite, sides, of, a, vehicle, regardless, of, their, mechanical, connection, to, each, other, and, to, the, vehicle, frame, or, body, thus, transverse, pairs, of, wheels, in, an, independent, suspension, may, be, called, an, axle, in, some, contexts, this, very, loose, definition, of, axle, is, often, used, in, assessing, toll, roads, or, vehicle, taxes, and, is, taken, as, a, rough, proxy, for, the, overall, weight, bearing, capacity, of, a, vehicle, and, its, potential, for, causing, wear, or, damage, to, roadway, surfaces, axles, are, an, integral, component, of, most, practical, wheeled, vehicles, in, a, solid, live, axle, suspension, system, the, rotating, inner, axle, cores, or, half, shafts, serve, to, transmit, driving, torque, to, the, wheels, at, each, end, while, the, rigid, outer, tube, maintains, the, position, of, the, wheels, at, fixed, angles, relative, to, the, axle, and, controls, the, angle, of, the, axle, and, wheels, assembly, to, the, vehicle, body, the, solid, axles, housings, in, this, system, must, also, bear, the, weight, of, the, vehicle, plus, any, cargo, a, non, driving, axle, such, as, the, front, beam, axle, in, heavy, duty, trucks, and, some, two, wheel, drive, light, trucks, and, vans, will, have, no, shaft, and, serves, only, as, a, suspension, and, steering, component, conversely, many, front, wheel, drive, cars, have, a, one, piece, rear, beam, axle, in, other, types, of, suspension, systems, the, axles, serve, only, to, transmit, driving, torque, to, the, wheels, the, position, and, angle, of, the, wheel, hubs, is, made, independent, from, the, axles, by, the, function, of, the, suspension, system, this, is, typical, of, the, independent, suspensions, found, on, most, newer, cars, and, even, suvs, and, on, the, front, of, many, light, trucks, an, exception, to, this, rule, is, the, independent, rear, swing, axle, suspension, wherein, the, half, axles, are, also, load, bearing, suspension, arms, independent, drive, trains, still, need, differentials, or, diffs, but, without, fixed, axle, housing, tubes, attached, the, diff, may, be, attached, to, the, vehicle, frame, or, body, and, or, be, integrated, with, the, transmission, or, gearbox, in, a, combined, transaxle, unit, the, axle, half, shafts, then, transmit, driving, torque, to, the, wheels, usually, via, constant, velocity, joints, like, a, full, floating, axle, system, the, drive, shafts, in, a, front, wheel, drive, independent, suspension, system, do, not, support, any, vehicle, weight, a, straight, axle, is, a, single, rigid, shaft, connecting, a, wheel, on, the, left, side, of, the, vehicle, to, a, wheel, on, the, right, side, the, axis, of, rotation, fixed, by, the, axle, is, common, to, both, wheels, such, a, design, can, keep, the, wheel, positions, steady, under, heavy, stress, and, can, therefore, support, heavy, loads, straight, axles, are, used, on, trains, that, is, locomotives, and, railway, wagons, for, the, rear, axles, of, commercial, trucks, and, on, heavy, duty, off, road, vehicles, the, axle, can, optionally, be, protected, and, further, reinforced, by, enclosing, the, length, of, the, axle, in, a, housing, in, split, axle, designs, the, wheel, on, each, side, is, attached, to, a, separate, shaft, modern, passenger, cars, have, split, drive, axles, in, some, designs, this, allows, independent, suspension, of, the, left, and, right, wheels, and, therefore, a, smoother, ride, even, when, the, suspension, is, not, independent, split, axles, permit, the, use, of, a, differential, allowing, the, left, and, right, drive, wheels, to, be, driven, at, different, speeds, as, the, automobile, turns, improving, traction, and, extending, tire, life, a, tandem, axle, is, a, group, of, two, or, more, axles, situated, close, together, truck, designs, use, such, a, configuration, to, provide, a, greater, weight, capacity, than, a, single, axle, semi, trailers, usually, have, a, tandem, axle, at, the, rear, axles, are, typically, made, from, sae, grade, 41xx, steel, or, sae, grade, 10xx, steel, sae, grade, 41xx, steel, is, commonly, known, as, chrome, molybdenum, steel, or, chrome, moly, while, sae, grade, 10xx, steel, is, known, as, carbon, steel, the, primary, differences, between, the, two, are, that, chrome, moly, steel, is, significantly, more, resistant, to, bending, or, breaking, and, is, very, difficult, to, weld, with, tools, normally, found, outside, a, professional, welding, shop, an, axle, that, is, driven, by, the, engine, or, prime, mover, is, called, a, drive, axle, modern, front, wheel, drive, cars, typically, combine, the, transmission, gearbox, and, differential, and, front, axle, into, a, single, unit, called, a, transaxle, the, drive, axle, is, a, split, axle, with, a, differential, and, universal, joints, between, the, two, half, axles, each, half, axle, connects, to, the, wheel, by, use, of, a, constant, velocity, cv, joint, which, allows, the, wheel, assembly, to, move, freely, vertically, as, well, as, to, pivot, when, making, turns, in, rear, wheel, drive, cars, and, trucks, the, engine, turns, a, driveshaft, also, called, a, propellor, shaft, or, tailshaft, which, transmits, the, rotational, force, to, a, drive, axle, at, the, rear, of, the, vehicle, the, drive, axle, may, be, a, live, axle, but, modern, rear, wheel, drive, automobiles, generally, use, a, split, axle, with, a, differential, in, this, case, one, half, axle, or, half, shaft, connects, the, differential, with, the, left, rear, wheel, a, second, half, shaft, does, the, same, with, the, right, rear, wheel, thus, the, two, half, axles, and, the, differential, constitute, the, rear, axle, the, front, drive, axle, is, providing, the, force, to, drive, the, truck, in, fact, only, one, wheel, of, that, axle, is, actually, moving, the, truck, and, trailer, down, the, road, some, simple, vehicle, designs, such, as, leisure, go, karts, may, have, a, single, driven, wheel, where, the, drive, axle, is, a, split, axle, with, only, one, of, the, two, shafts, driven, by, the, engine, or, else, have, both, wheels, connected, to, one, shaft, without, a, differential, kart, racing, however, other, go, karts, have, two, rear, drive, wheels, too, some, dump, trucks, and, trailers, may, be, configured, with, a, lift, axle, also, known, as, an, airlift, axle, or, drop, axle, which, may, be, mechanically, raised, or, lowered, the, axle, is, lowered, to, increase, the, weight, capacity, or, to, distribute, the, weight, of, the, cargo, over, more, wheels, for, example, to, cross, a, weight, restricted, bridge, when, not, needed, the, axle, is, lifted, off, the, ground, to, save, wear, on, the, tires, and, axle, and, to, increase, traction, in, the, remaining, wheels, and, to, decrease, fuel, consumption, lifting, an, axle, also, alleviates, lateral, scrubbing, of, the, additional, axle, in, very, tight, turns, allowing, the, vehicle, to, turn, more, readily, in, some, situations, the, removal, of, pressure, from, the, additional, axle, is, necessary, for, the, vehicle, to, complete, a, turn, at, all, several, manufacturers, offer, computer, controlled, airlifts, so, that, the, dead, axles, are, automatically, lowered, when, the, main, axle, reaches, its, weight, limit, the, dead, axles, can, still, be, lifted, by, the, press, of, a, button, if, needed, for, better, maneuverability, lift, axles, were, in, use, in, the, early, 1940s, initially, the, axle, was, lifted, by, a, mechanical, device, soon, hydraulics, replaced, the, mechanical, lift, system, one, of, the, early, manufacturers, was, zetterbergs, located, in, sterv, la, sweden, their, brand, was, zeta, lyften, the, liftable, tandem, drive, axle, was, invented, in, 1957, by, the, finnish, truck, manufacturer, vanajan, autotehdas, a, company, sharing, history, with, sisu, auto, a, full, floating, axle, carries, the, vehicle, s, weight, on, the, axle, casing, not, the, half, shafts, they, serve, only, to, transmit, torque, from, the, differential, to, the, wheels, they, float, inside, an, assembly, that, carries, the, vehicle, s, weight, thus, the, only, stress, it, must, endure, is, torque, not, lateral, bending, force, full, floating, axle, shafts, are, retained, by, a, flange, bolted, to, the, hub, while, the, hub, and, bearings, are, retained, on, the, spindle, by, a, large, nut, in, contrast, a, semi, floating, design, carries, the, weight, of, the, vehicle, on, the, axle, shaft, itself, there, is, a, single, bearing, at, the, end, of, the, axle, housing, that, carries, the, load, from, the, axle, and, that, the, axle, rotates, through, to, be, semi, floating, the, axle, shafts, must, be, able, to, float, in, the, housing, bearings, and, seals, and, not, subject, to, axial, thrust, and, or, bearing, preload, needle, bearings, and, separate, lip, seals, are, used, in, semi, floating, axles, with, axle, retained, in, the, housing, at, their, inner, ends, typically, with, circlips, which, are, 3, round, hardened, washers, that, slide, into, grooves, machined, at, the, inner, end, of, the, shafts, and, retained, in, by, recesses, in, the, differential, carrier, side, gears, which, are, themselves, retained, by, the, differential, pinion, gear, or, spider, gear, shaft, a, true, semi, floating, axle, assembly, places, no, side, loads, on, the, axle, housing, tubes, or, axle, shafts, axles, that, are, pressed, into, ball, or, tapered, roller, bearings, which, are, in, turn, retained, in, the, axle, housings, with, flanges, bolts, and, nuts, do, not, float, and, place, axial, loads, on, the, bearings, housings, and, only, a, short, section, of, the, shaft, itself, that, also, carries, all, radial, loads, the, full, floating, design, is, typically, used, in, most, and, 1, ton, light, trucks, medium, duty, trucks, and, heavy, duty, trucks, the, overall, assembly, can, carry, more, weight, than, a, semi, floating, or, non, floating, axle, assembly, because, the, hubs, have, two, bearings, riding, on, a, fixed, spindle, a, full, floating, axle, can, be, identified, by, a, protruding, hub, to, which, the, axle, shaft, flange, is, bolted, the, semi, floating, axle, setup, is, commonly, used, on, half, ton, and, lighter, 4, 4, trucks, in, the, rear, this, setup, allows, the, axle, shaft, to, be, the, means, of, propulsion, and, also, support, the, weight, of, the, vehicle, the, main, difference, between, the, full, and, semi, floating, axle, setups, is, the, number, of, bearings, the, semi, floating, axle, features, only, one, bearing, while, the, full, floating, assembly, has, bearings, on, both, the, inside, and, outside, of, the, wheel, hub, the, other, difference, is, axle, removal, to, remove, the, semi, floating, axle, the, wheel, must, be, removed, first, if, such, an, axle, breaks, the, wheel, is, most, likely, to, come, off, the, vehicle, the, semi, floating, design, is, found, under, most, ton, and, lighter, trucks, as, well, as, in, suvs, and, rear, wheel, drive, passenger, cars, usually, being, smaller, or, less, expensive, models, a, benefit, of, a, full, floating, axle, is, that, even, if, an, axle, shaft, used, to, transmit, torque, or, power, breaks, the, wheel, will, not, come, off, preventing, serious, accidents
