photography, is, the, art, application, and, practice, of, creating, images, by, recording, light, either, electronically, by, means, of, an, image, sensor, or, chemically, by, means, of, a, light, sensitive, material, such, as, photographic, film, it, is, employed, in, many, fields, of, science, manufacturing, e, g, photolithography, and, business, as, well, as, its, more, direct, uses, for, art, film, and, video, production, recreational, purposes, hobby, and, mass, communication, a, person, who, makes, photographs, is, called, a, photographer, typically, a, lens, is, used, to, focus, the, light, reflected, or, emitted, from, objects, into, a, real, image, on, the, light, sensitive, surface, inside, a, camera, during, a, timed, exposure, with, an, electronic, image, sensor, this, produces, an, electrical, charge, at, each, pixel, which, is, electronically, processed, and, stored, in, a, digital, image, file, for, subsequent, display, or, processing, the, result, with, photographic, emulsion, is, an, invisible, latent, image, which, is, later, chemically, developed, into, a, visible, image, either, negative, or, positive, depending, on, the, purpose, of, the, photographic, material, and, the, method, of, processing, a, negative, image, on, film, is, traditionally, used, to, photographically, create, a, positive, image, on, a, paper, base, known, as, a, print, either, by, using, an, enlarger, or, by, contact, printing, the, word, photography, was, created, from, the, greek, roots, ph, t, s, genitive, of, ph, s, light, and, graph, representation, by, means, of, lines, or, drawing, together, meaning, drawing, with, light, several, people, may, have, coined, the, same, new, term, from, these, roots, independently, h, rcules, florence, a, french, painter, and, inventor, living, in, campinas, brazil, used, the, french, form, of, the, word, photographie, in, private, notes, which, a, brazilian, historian, believes, were, written, in, 1834, this, claim, is, widely, reported, but, is, not, yet, largely, recognized, internationally, the, first, use, of, the, word, by, florence, became, widely, known, after, the, research, of, boris, kossoy, in, 1980, the, german, newspaper, vossische, zeitung, of, 25, february, 1839, contained, an, article, entitled, photographie, discussing, several, priority, claims, especially, henry, fox, talbot, s, regarding, daguerre, s, claim, of, invention, the, article, is, the, earliest, known, occurrence, of, the, word, in, public, print, it, was, signed, j, m, believed, to, have, been, berlin, astronomer, johann, von, maedler, the, astronomer, john, herschel, is, also, credited, with, coining, the, word, independent, of, talbot, in, 1839, the, inventors, nic, phore, ni, pce, talbot, and, louis, daguerre, seem, not, to, have, known, or, used, the, word, photography, but, referred, to, their, processes, as, heliography, ni, pce, photogenic, drawing, talbotype, calotype, talbot, and, daguerreotype, daguerre, photography, is, the, result, of, combining, several, technical, discoveries, relating, to, seeing, an, image, and, capturing, the, image, the, discovery, of, the, camera, obscura, dark, chamber, in, latin, that, provides, an, image, of, a, scene, dates, back, to, ancient, china, greek, mathematicians, aristotle, and, euclid, independently, described, a, camera, obscura, in, the, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bce, in, the, 6th, century, ce, byzantine, mathematician, anthemius, of, tralles, used, a, type, of, camera, obscura, in, his, experiments, the, arab, physicist, ibn, al, haytham, alhazen, 965, 1040, also, invented, a, camera, obscura, as, well, as, the, first, true, pinhole, camera, the, invention, of, the, camera, has, been, traced, back, to, the, work, of, ibn, al, haytham, while, the, effects, of, a, single, light, passing, through, a, pinhole, had, been, described, earlier, ibn, al, haytham, gave, the, first, correct, analysis, of, the, camera, obscura, including, the, first, geometrical, and, quantitative, descriptions, of, the, phenomenon, and, was, the, first, to, use, a, screen, in, a, dark, room, so, that, an, image, from, one, side, of, a, hole, in, the, surface, could, be, projected, onto, a, screen, on, the, other, side, he, also, first, understood, the, relationship, between, the, focal, point, and, the, pinhole, and, performed, early, experiments, with, afterimages, laying, the, foundations, for, the, invention, of, photography, in, the, 19th, century, leonardo, da, vinci, mentions, natural, camerae, obscurae, that, are, formed, by, dark, caves, on, the, edge, of, a, sunlit, valley, a, hole, in, the, cave, wall, will, act, as, a, pinhole, camera, and, project, a, laterally, reversed, upside, down, image, on, a, piece, of, paper, renaissance, painters, used, the, camera, obscura, which, in, fact, gives, the, optical, rendering, in, color, that, dominates, western, art, it, is, a, box, with, a, small, hole, in, one, side, which, allows, specific, light, rays, to, enter, projecting, an, inverted, image, onto, a, viewing, screen, or, paper, the, birth, of, photography, was, then, concerned, with, inventing, means, to, capture, and, keep, the, image, produced, by, the, camera, obscura, albertus, magnus, 1193, 1280, discovered, silver, nitrate, and, georg, fabricius, 1516, 1571, discovered, silver, chloride, and, the, techniques, described, in, ibn, al, haytham, s, book, of, optics, are, capable, of, producing, primitive, photographs, using, medieval, materials, daniele, barbaro, described, a, diaphragm, in, 1566, wilhelm, homberg, described, how, light, darkened, some, chemicals, photochemical, effect, in, 1694, around, 1717, johann, heinrich, schulze, used, a, light, sensitive, slurry, to, capture, images, of, cut, out, letters, on, a, bottle, and, on, that, basis, many, german, sources, and, some, international, ones, credit, schulze, as, the, inventor, of, photography, the, fiction, book, giphantie, published, in, 1760, by, french, author, tiphaigne, de, la, roche, described, what, can, be, interpreted, as, photography, in, june, 1802, british, inventor, thomas, wedgwood, made, the, first, known, attempt, to, capture, the, image, in, a, camera, obscura, by, means, of, a, light, sensitive, substance, he, used, paper, or, white, leather, treated, with, silver, nitrate, although, he, succeeded, in, capturing, the, shadows, of, objects, placed, on, the, surface, in, direct, sunlight, and, even, made, shadow, copies, of, paintings, on, glass, it, was, reported, in, 1802, that, the, images, formed, by, means, of, a, camera, obscura, have, been, found, too, faint, to, produce, in, any, moderate, time, an, effect, upon, the, nitrate, of, silver, the, shadow, images, eventually, darkened, all, over, the, first, permanent, photoetching, was, an, image, produced, in, 1822, by, the, french, inventor, nic, phore, ni, pce, but, it, was, destroyed, in, a, later, attempt, to, make, prints, from, it, ni, pce, was, successful, again, in, 1825, in, 1826, he, made, the, view, from, the, window, at, le, gras, the, earliest, surviving, photograph, from, nature, i, e, of, the, image, of, a, real, world, scene, as, formed, in, a, camera, obscura, by, a, lens, because, ni, pce, s, camera, photographs, required, an, extremely, long, exposure, at, least, eight, hours, and, probably, several, days, he, sought, to, greatly, improve, his, bitumen, process, or, replace, it, with, one, that, was, more, practical, in, partnership, with, louis, daguerre, he, worked, out, post, exposure, processing, methods, that, produced, visually, superior, results, and, replaced, the, bitumen, with, a, more, light, sensitive, resin, but, hours, of, exposure, in, the, camera, were, still, required, with, an, eye, to, eventual, commercial, exploitation, the, partners, opted, for, total, secrecy, ni, pce, died, in, 1833, and, daguerre, then, redirected, the, experiments, toward, the, light, sensitive, silver, halides, which, ni, pce, had, abandoned, many, years, earlier, because, of, his, inability, to, make, the, images, he, captured, with, them, light, fast, and, permanent, daguerre, s, efforts, culminated, in, what, would, later, be, named, the, daguerreotype, process, the, essential, elements, a, silver, plated, surface, sensitized, by, iodine, vapor, developed, by, mercury, vapor, and, fixed, with, hot, saturated, salt, water, were, in, place, in, 1837, the, required, exposure, time, was, measured, in, minutes, instead, of, hours, daguerre, took, the, earliest, confirmed, photograph, of, a, person, in, 1838, while, capturing, a, view, of, a, paris, street, unlike, the, other, pedestrian, and, horse, drawn, traffic, on, the, busy, boulevard, which, appears, deserted, one, man, having, his, boots, polished, stood, sufficiently, still, throughout, the, several, minutes, long, exposure, to, be, visible, the, existence, of, daguerre, s, process, was, publicly, announced, without, details, on, 7, january, 1839, the, news, created, an, international, sensation, france, soon, agreed, to, pay, daguerre, a, pension, in, exchange, for, the, right, to, present, his, invention, to, the, world, as, the, gift, of, france, which, occurred, when, complete, working, instructions, were, unveiled, on, 19, august, 1839, in, that, same, year, american, photographer, robert, cornelius, is, credited, with, taking, the, earliest, surviving, photographic, self, portrait, in, brazil, hercules, florence, had, apparently, started, working, out, a, silver, salt, based, paper, process, in, 1832, later, naming, it, photographie, meanwhile, a, british, inventor, william, fox, talbot, had, succeeded, in, making, crude, but, reasonably, light, fast, silver, images, on, paper, as, early, as, 1834, but, had, kept, his, work, secret, after, reading, about, daguerre, s, invention, in, january, 1839, talbot, published, his, hitherto, secret, method, and, set, about, improving, on, it, at, first, like, other, pre, daguerreotype, processes, talbot, s, paper, based, photography, typically, required, hours, long, exposures, in, the, camera, but, in, 1840, he, created, the, calotype, process, which, used, the, chemical, development, of, a, latent, image, to, greatly, reduce, the, exposure, needed, and, compete, with, the, daguerreotype, in, both, its, original, and, calotype, forms, talbot, s, process, unlike, daguerre, s, created, a, translucent, negative, which, could, be, used, to, print, multiple, positive, copies, this, is, the, basis, of, most, modern, chemical, photography, up, to, the, present, day, as, daguerreotypes, could, only, be, replicated, by, rephotographing, them, with, a, camera, talbot, s, famous, tiny, paper, negative, of, the, oriel, window, in, lacock, abbey, one, of, a, number, of, camera, photographs, he, made, in, the, summer, of, 1835, may, be, the, oldest, camera, negative, in, existence, in, march, 1837, steinheil, along, with, franz, von, kobell, used, silver, chloride, and, a, cardboard, camera, to, make, pictures, in, negative, of, the, frauenkirche, and, other, buildings, in, munich, then, taking, another, picture, of, the, negative, to, get, a, positive, the, actual, black, and, white, reproduction, of, a, view, on, the, object, the, pictures, produced, were, round, with, a, diameter, of, 4, cm, the, method, was, later, named, the, steinheil, method, in, france, hippolyte, bayard, invented, his, own, process, for, producing, direct, positive, paper, prints, and, claimed, to, have, invented, photography, earlier, than, daguerre, or, talbot, british, chemist, john, herschel, made, many, contributions, to, the, new, field, he, invented, the, cyanotype, process, later, familiar, as, the, blueprint, he, was, the, first, to, use, the, terms, photography, negative, and, positive, he, had, discovered, in, 1819, that, sodium, thiosulphate, was, a, solvent, of, silver, halides, and, in, 1839, he, informed, talbot, and, indirectly, daguerre, that, it, could, be, used, to, fix, silver, halide, based, photographs, and, make, them, completely, light, fast, he, made, the, first, glass, negative, in, late, 1839, in, the, march, 1851, issue, of, the, chemist, frederick, scott, archer, published, his, wet, plate, collodion, process, it, became, the, most, widely, used, photographic, medium, until, the, gelatin, dry, plate, introduced, in, the, 1870s, eventually, replaced, it, there, are, three, subsets, to, the, collodion, process, the, ambrotype, a, positive, image, on, glass, the, ferrotype, or, tintype, a, positive, image, on, metal, and, the, glass, negative, which, was, used, to, make, positive, prints, on, albumen, or, salted, paper, many, advances, in, photographic, glass, plates, and, printing, were, made, during, the, rest, of, the, 19th, century, in, 1891, gabriel, lippmann, introduced, a, process, for, making, natural, color, photographs, based, on, the, optical, phenomenon, of, the, interference, of, light, waves, his, scientifically, elegant, and, important, but, ultimately, impractical, invention, earned, him, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1908, glass, plates, were, the, medium, for, most, original, camera, photography, from, the, late, 1850s, until, the, general, introduction, of, flexible, plastic, films, during, the, 1890s, although, the, convenience, of, the, film, greatly, popularized, amateur, photography, early, films, were, somewhat, more, expensive, and, of, markedly, lower, optical, quality, than, their, glass, plate, equivalents, and, until, the, late, 1910s, they, were, not, available, in, the, large, formats, preferred, by, most, professional, photographers, so, the, new, medium, did, not, immediately, or, completely, replace, the, old, because, of, the, superior, dimensional, stability, of, glass, the, use, of, plates, for, some, scientific, applications, such, as, astrophotography, continued, into, the, 1990s, and, in, the, niche, field, of, laser, holography, it, has, persisted, into, the, 21st, century, hurter, and, driffield, began, pioneering, work, on, the, light, sensitivity, of, photographic, emulsions, in, 1876, their, work, enabled, the, first, quantitative, measure, of, film, speed, to, be, devised, the, first, flexible, photographic, roll, film, was, marketed, by, george, eastman, founder, of, kodak, in, 1885, but, this, original, film, was, actually, a, coating, on, a, paper, base, as, part, of, the, processing, the, image, bearing, layer, was, stripped, from, the, paper, and, transferred, to, a, hardened, gelatin, support, the, first, transparent, plastic, roll, film, followed, in, 1889, it, was, made, from, highly, flammable, nitrocellulose, known, as, nitrate, film, although, cellulose, acetate, or, safety, film, had, been, introduced, by, kodak, in, 1908, at, first, it, found, only, a, few, special, applications, as, an, alternative, to, the, hazardous, nitrate, film, which, had, the, advantages, of, being, considerably, tougher, slightly, more, transparent, and, cheaper, the, changeover, was, not, completed, for, x, ray, films, until, 1933, and, although, safety, film, was, always, used, for, 16, mm, and, 8, mm, home, movies, nitrate, film, remained, standard, for, theatrical, 35, mm, motion, pictures, until, it, was, finally, discontinued, in, 1951, films, remained, the, dominant, form, of, photography, until, the, early, 21st, century, when, advances, in, digital, photography, drew, consumers, to, digital, formats, although, modern, photography, is, dominated, by, digital, users, film, continues, to, be, used, by, enthusiasts, and, professional, photographers, the, distinctive, look, of, film, based, photographs, compared, to, digital, images, is, likely, due, to, a, combination, of, factors, including, 1, differences, in, spectral, and, tonal, sensitivity, s, shaped, density, to, exposure, h, d, curve, with, film, vs, linear, response, curve, for, digital, ccd, sensors, 2, resolution, and, 3, continuity, of, tone, originally, all, photography, was, monochrome, or, black, and, white, even, after, color, film, was, readily, available, black, and, white, photography, continued, to, dominate, for, decades, due, to, its, lower, cost, chemical, stability, and, its, classic, photographic, look, the, tones, and, contrast, between, light, and, dark, areas, define, black, and, white, photography, monochromatic, pictures, are, not, necessarily, composed, of, pure, blacks, whites, and, intermediate, shades, of, gray, but, can, involve, shades, of, one, particular, hue, depending, on, the, process, the, cyanotype, process, for, example, produces, an, image, composed, of, blue, tones, the, albumen, print, process, publicly, revealed, in, 1847, produces, brownish, tones, many, photographers, continue, to, produce, some, monochrome, images, sometimes, because, of, the, established, archival, permanence, of, well, processed, silver, halide, based, materials, some, full, color, digital, images, are, processed, using, a, variety, of, techniques, to, create, black, and, white, results, and, some, manufacturers, produce, digital, cameras, that, exclusively, shoot, monochrome, monochrome, printing, or, electronic, display, can, be, used, to, salvage, certain, photographs, taken, in, color, which, are, unsatisfactory, in, their, original, form, sometimes, when, presented, as, black, and, white, or, single, color, toned, images, they, are, found, to, be, more, effective, although, color, photography, has, long, predominated, monochrome, images, are, still, produced, mostly, for, artistic, reasons, almost, all, digital, cameras, have, an, option, to, shoot, in, monochrome, and, almost, all, image, editing, software, can, combine, or, selectively, discard, rgb, color, channels, to, produce, a, monochrome, image, from, one, shot, in, color, color, photography, was, explored, beginning, in, the, 1840s, early, experiments, in, color, required, extremely, long, exposures, hours, or, days, for, camera, images, and, could, not, fix, the, photograph, to, prevent, the, color, from, quickly, fading, when, exposed, to, white, light, the, first, permanent, color, photograph, was, taken, in, 1861, using, the, three, color, separation, principle, first, published, by, scottish, physicist, james, clerk, maxwell, in, 1855, the, foundation, of, virtually, all, practical, color, processes, maxwell, s, idea, was, to, take, three, separate, black, and, white, photographs, through, red, green, and, blue, filters, this, provides, the, photographer, with, the, three, basic, channels, required, to, recreate, a, color, image, transparent, prints, of, the, images, could, be, projected, through, similar, color, filters, and, superimposed, on, the, projection, screen, an, additive, method, of, color, reproduction, a, color, print, on, paper, could, be, produced, by, superimposing, carbon, prints, of, the, three, images, made, in, their, complementary, colors, a, subtractive, method, of, color, reproduction, pioneered, by, louis, ducos, du, hauron, in, the, late, 1860s, russian, photographer, sergei, mikhailovich, prokudin, gorskii, made, extensive, use, of, this, color, separation, technique, employing, a, special, camera, which, successively, exposed, the, three, color, filtered, images, on, different, parts, of, an, oblong, plate, because, his, exposures, were, not, simultaneous, unsteady, subjects, exhibited, color, fringes, or, if, rapidly, moving, through, the, scene, appeared, as, brightly, colored, ghosts, in, the, resulting, projected, or, printed, images, implementation, of, color, photography, was, hindered, by, the, limited, sensitivity, of, early, photographic, materials, which, were, mostly, sensitive, to, blue, only, slightly, sensitive, to, green, and, virtually, insensitive, to, red, the, discovery, of, dye, sensitization, by, photochemist, hermann, vogel, in, 1873, suddenly, made, it, possible, to, add, sensitivity, to, green, yellow, and, even, red, improved, color, sensitizers, and, ongoing, improvements, in, the, overall, sensitivity, of, emulsions, steadily, reduced, the, once, prohibitive, long, exposure, times, required, for, color, bringing, it, ever, closer, to, commercial, viability, autochrome, the, first, commercially, successful, color, process, was, introduced, by, the, lumi, re, brothers, in, 1907, autochrome, plates, incorporated, a, mosaic, color, filter, layer, made, of, dyed, grains, of, potato, starch, which, allowed, the, three, color, components, to, be, recorded, as, adjacent, microscopic, image, fragments, after, an, autochrome, plate, was, reversal, processed, to, produce, a, positive, transparency, the, starch, grains, served, to, illuminate, each, fragment, with, the, correct, color, and, the, tiny, colored, points, blended, together, in, the, eye, synthesizing, the, color, of, the, subject, by, the, additive, method, autochrome, plates, were, one, of, several, varieties, of, additive, color, screen, plates, and, films, marketed, between, the, 1890s, and, the, 1950s, kodachrome, the, first, modern, integral, tripack, or, monopack, color, film, was, introduced, by, kodak, in, 1935, it, captured, the, three, color, components, in, a, multi, layer, emulsion, one, layer, was, sensitized, to, record, the, red, dominated, part, of, the, spectrum, another, layer, recorded, only, the, green, part, and, a, third, recorded, only, the, blue, without, special, film, processing, the, result, would, simply, be, three, superimposed, black, and, white, images, but, complementary, cyan, magenta, and, yellow, dye, images, were, created, in, those, layers, by, adding, color, couplers, during, a, complex, processing, procedure, agfa, s, similarly, structured, agfacolor, neu, was, introduced, in, 1936, unlike, kodachrome, the, color, couplers, in, agfacolor, neu, were, incorporated, into, the, emulsion, layers, during, manufacture, which, greatly, simplified, the, processing, currently, available, color, films, still, employ, a, multi, layer, emulsion, and, the, same, principles, most, closely, resembling, agfa, s, product, instant, color, film, used, in, a, special, camera, which, yielded, a, unique, finished, color, print, only, a, minute, or, two, after, the, exposure, was, introduced, by, polaroid, in, 1963, color, photography, may, form, images, as, positive, transparencies, which, can, be, used, in, a, slide, projector, or, as, color, negatives, intended, for, use, in, creating, positive, color, enlargements, on, specially, coated, paper, the, latter, is, now, the, most, common, form, of, film, non, digital, color, photography, owing, to, the, introduction, of, automated, photo, printing, equipment, after, a, transition, period, centered, around, 1995, 2005, color, film, was, relegated, to, a, niche, market, by, inexpensive, multi, megapixel, digital, cameras, film, continues, to, be, the, preference, of, some, photographers, because, of, its, distinctive, look, in, 1981, sony, unveiled, the, first, consumer, camera, to, use, a, charge, coupled, device, for, imaging, eliminating, the, need, for, film, the, sony, mavica, while, the, mavica, saved, images, to, disk, the, images, were, displayed, on, television, and, the, camera, was, not, fully, digital, the, first, digital, camera, to, both, record, and, save, images, in, a, digital, format, was, the, fujix, ds, 1p, created, by, fujifilm, in, 1988, in, 1991, kodak, unveiled, the, dcs, 100, the, first, commercially, available, digital, single, lens, reflex, camera, although, its, high, cost, precluded, uses, other, than, photojournalism, and, professional, photography, commercial, digital, photography, was, born, digital, imaging, uses, an, electronic, image, sensor, to, record, the, image, as, a, set, of, electronic, data, rather, than, as, chemical, changes, on, film, an, important, difference, between, digital, and, chemical, photography, is, that, chemical, photography, resists, photo, manipulation, because, it, involves, film, and, photographic, paper, while, digital, imaging, is, a, highly, manipulative, medium, this, difference, allows, for, a, degree, of, image, post, processing, that, is, comparatively, difficult, in, film, based, photography, and, permits, different, communicative, potentials, and, applications, digital, photography, dominates, the, 21st, century, more, than, 99, of, photographs, taken, around, the, world, are, through, digital, cameras, increasingly, through, smartphones, a, large, variety, of, photographic, techniques, and, media, are, used, in, the, process, of, capturing, images, for, photography, these, include, the, camera, dualphotography, full, spectrum, ultraviolet, and, infrared, media, light, field, photography, and, other, imaging, techniques, the, camera, is, the, image, forming, device, and, a, photographic, plate, photographic, film, or, a, silicon, electronic, image, sensor, is, the, capture, medium, the, respective, recording, medium, can, be, the, plate, or, film, itself, or, a, digital, magnetic, or, electronic, memory, photographers, control, the, camera, and, lens, to, expose, the, light, recording, material, to, the, required, amount, of, light, to, form, a, latent, image, on, plate, or, film, or, raw, file, in, digital, cameras, which, after, appropriate, processing, is, converted, to, a, usable, image, digital, cameras, use, an, electronic, image, sensor, based, on, light, sensitive, electronics, such, as, charge, coupled, device, ccd, or, complementary, metal, oxide, semiconductor, cmos, technology, the, resulting, digital, image, is, stored, electronically, but, can, be, reproduced, on, a, paper, the, camera, or, camera, obscura, is, a, dark, room, or, chamber, from, which, as, far, as, possible, all, light, is, excluded, except, the, light, that, forms, the, image, it, was, discovered, and, used, in, the, 16th, century, by, painters, the, subject, being, photographed, however, must, be, illuminated, cameras, can, range, from, small, to, very, large, a, whole, room, that, is, kept, dark, while, the, object, to, be, photographed, is, in, another, room, where, it, is, properly, illuminated, this, was, common, for, reproduction, photography, of, flat, copy, when, large, film, negatives, were, used, see, process, camera, as, soon, as, photographic, materials, became, fast, sensitive, enough, for, taking, candid, or, surreptitious, pictures, small, detective, cameras, were, made, some, actually, disguised, as, a, book, or, handbag, or, pocket, watch, the, ticka, camera, or, even, worn, hidden, behind, an, ascot, necktie, with, a, tie, pin, that, was, really, the, lens, the, movie, camera, is, a, type, of, photographic, camera, that, takes, a, rapid, sequence, of, photographs, on, recording, medium, in, contrast, to, a, still, camera, which, captures, a, single, snapshot, at, a, time, the, movie, camera, takes, a, series, of, images, each, called, a, frame, this, is, accomplished, through, an, intermittent, mechanism, the, frames, are, later, played, back, in, a, movie, projector, at, a, specific, speed, called, the, frame, rate, number, of, frames, per, second, while, viewing, a, person, s, eyes, and, brain, merge, the, separate, pictures, to, create, the, illusion, of, motion, photographs, both, monochrome, and, color, can, be, captured, and, displayed, through, two, side, by, side, images, that, emulate, human, stereoscopic, vision, stereoscopic, photography, was, the, first, that, captured, figures, in, motion, while, known, colloquially, as, 3, d, photography, the, more, accurate, term, is, stereoscopy, such, cameras, have, long, been, realized, by, using, film, and, more, recently, in, digital, electronic, methods, including, cell, phone, cameras, dualphotography, consists, of, photographing, a, scene, from, both, sides, of, a, photographic, device, at, once, e, g, camera, for, back, to, back, dualphotography, or, two, networked, cameras, for, portal, plane, dualphotography, the, dualphoto, apparatus, can, be, used, to, simultaneously, capture, both, the, subject, and, the, photographer, or, both, sides, of, a, geographical, place, at, once, thus, adding, a, supplementary, narrative, layer, to, that, of, a, single, image, ultraviolet, and, infrared, films, have, been, available, for, many, decades, and, employed, in, a, variety, of, photographic, avenues, since, the, 1960s, new, technological, trends, in, digital, photography, have, opened, a, new, direction, in, full, spectrum, photography, where, careful, filtering, choices, across, the, ultraviolet, visible, and, infrared, lead, to, new, artistic, visions, modified, digital, cameras, can, detect, some, ultraviolet, all, of, the, visible, and, much, of, the, near, infrared, spectrum, as, most, digital, imaging, sensors, are, sensitive, from, about, 350, nm, to, 1000, nm, an, off, the, shelf, digital, camera, contains, an, infrared, hot, mirror, filter, that, blocks, most, of, the, infrared, and, a, bit, of, the, ultraviolet, that, would, otherwise, be, detected, by, the, sensor, narrowing, the, accepted, range, from, about, 400, nm, to, 700, nm, replacing, a, hot, mirror, or, infrared, blocking, filter, with, an, infrared, pass, or, a, wide, spectrally, transmitting, filter, allows, the, camera, to, detect, the, wider, spectrum, light, at, greater, sensitivity, without, the, hot, mirror, the, red, green, and, blue, or, cyan, yellow, and, magenta, colored, micro, filters, placed, over, the, sensor, elements, pass, varying, amounts, of, ultraviolet, blue, window, and, infrared, primarily, red, and, somewhat, lesser, the, green, and, blue, micro, filters, uses, of, full, spectrum, photography, are, for, fine, art, photography, geology, forensics, and, law, enforcement, layering, is, a, photographic, composition, technique, that, manipulates, the, foreground, subject, or, middle, ground, and, background, layers, in, a, way, that, they, all, work, together, to, tell, a, story, through, the, image, layers, may, be, incorporated, by, altering, the, focal, length, distorting, the, perspective, by, positioning, the, camera, in, a, certain, spot, people, movement, light, and, a, variety, of, objects, can, be, used, in, layering, digital, methods, of, image, capture, and, display, processing, have, enabled, the, new, technology, of, light, field, photography, also, known, as, synthetic, aperture, photography, this, process, allows, focusing, at, various, depths, of, field, to, be, selected, after, the, photograph, has, been, captured, as, explained, by, michael, faraday, in, 1846, the, light, field, is, understood, as, 5, dimensional, with, each, point, in, 3, d, space, having, attributes, of, two, more, angles, that, define, the, direction, of, each, ray, passing, through, that, point, these, additional, vector, attributes, can, be, captured, optically, through, the, use, of, microlenses, at, each, pixel, point, within, the, 2, dimensional, image, sensor, every, pixel, of, the, final, image, is, actually, a, selection, from, each, sub, array, located, under, each, microlens, as, identified, by, a, post, image, capture, focus, algorithm, besides, the, camera, other, methods, of, forming, images, with, light, are, available, for, instance, a, photocopy, or, xerography, machine, forms, permanent, images, but, uses, the, transfer, of, static, electrical, charges, rather, than, photographic, medium, hence, the, term, electrophotography, photograms, are, images, produced, by, the, shadows, of, objects, cast, on, the, photographic, paper, without, the, use, of, a, camera, objects, can, also, be, placed, directly, on, the, glass, of, an, image, scanner, to, produce, digital, pictures, amateur, photographers, take, photos, for, personal, use, as, a, hobby, or, out, of, casual, interest, rather, than, as, a, business, or, job, the, quality, of, amateur, work, can, be, comparable, to, that, of, many, professionals, amateurs, can, fill, a, gap, in, subjects, or, topics, that, might, not, otherwise, be, photographed, if, they, are, not, commercially, useful, or, salable, amateur, photography, grew, during, the, late, 19th, century, due, to, the, popularization, of, the, hand, held, camera, twenty, first, century, social, media, and, near, ubiquitous, camera, phones, have, made, photographic, and, video, recording, pervasive, in, everyday, life, in, the, mid, 2010s, smartphone, cameras, added, numerous, automatic, assistance, features, like, color, management, autofocus, face, detection, and, image, stabilization, that, significantly, decreased, skill, and, effort, needed, to, take, high, quality, images, commercial, photography, is, probably, best, defined, as, any, photography, for, which, the, photographer, is, paid, for, images, rather, than, works, of, art, in, this, light, money, could, be, paid, for, the, subject, of, the, photograph, or, the, photograph, itself, the, commercial, photographic, world, could, include, during, the, 20th, century, both, fine, art, photography, and, documentary, photography, became, accepted, by, the, english, speaking, art, world, and, the, gallery, system, in, the, united, states, a, handful, of, photographers, including, alfred, stieglitz, edward, steichen, john, szarkowski, f, holland, day, and, edward, weston, spent, their, lives, advocating, for, photography, as, a, fine, art, at, first, fine, art, photographers, tried, to, imitate, painting, styles, this, movement, is, called, pictorialism, often, using, soft, focus, for, a, dreamy, romantic, look, in, reaction, to, that, weston, ansel, adams, and, others, formed, the, group, f, 64, to, advocate, straight, photography, the, photograph, as, a, sharply, focused, thing, in, itself, and, not, an, imitation, of, something, else, the, aesthetics, of, photography, is, a, matter, that, continues, to, be, discussed, regularly, especially, in, artistic, circles, many, artists, argued, that, photography, was, the, mechanical, reproduction, of, an, image, if, photography, is, authentically, art, then, photography, in, the, context, of, art, would, need, redefinition, such, as, determining, what, component, of, a, photograph, makes, it, beautiful, to, the, viewer, the, controversy, began, with, the, earliest, images, written, with, light, nic, phore, ni, pce, louis, daguerre, and, others, among, the, very, earliest, photographers, were, met, with, acclaim, but, some, questioned, if, their, work, met, the, definitions, and, purposes, of, art, clive, bell, in, his, classic, essay, art, states, that, only, significant, form, can, distinguish, art, from, what, is, not, art, there, must, be, some, one, quality, without, which, a, work, of, art, cannot, exist, possessing, which, in, the, least, degree, no, work, is, altogether, worthless, what, is, this, quality, what, quality, is, shared, by, all, objects, that, provoke, our, aesthetic, emotions, what, quality, is, common, to, sta, sophia, and, the, windows, at, chartres, mexican, sculpture, a, persian, bowl, chinese, carpets, giotto, s, frescoes, at, padua, and, the, masterpieces, of, poussin, piero, della, francesca, and, cezanne, only, one, answer, seems, possible, significant, form, in, each, lines, and, colors, combined, in, a, particular, way, certain, forms, and, relations, of, forms, stir, our, aesthetic, emotions, on, 7, february, 2007, sotheby, s, london, sold, the, 2001, photograph, 99, cent, ii, diptychon, for, an, unprecedented, 3, 346, 456, to, an, anonymous, bidder, making, it, the, most, expensive, at, the, time, conceptual, photography, turns, a, concept, or, idea, into, a, photograph, even, though, what, is, depicted, in, the, photographs, are, real, objects, the, subject, is, strictly, abstract, in, parallel, to, this, development, the, then, largely, separate, interface, between, painting, and, photography, was, closed, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, with, the, chemigram, of, pierre, cordier, and, the, chemogram, of, josef, h, neumann, in, 1974, the, chemograms, by, josef, h, neumann, concluded, the, separation, of, the, painterly, background, and, the, photographic, layer, by, showing, the, picture, elements, in, a, symbiosis, that, had, never, existed, before, as, an, unmistakable, unique, specimen, in, a, simultaneous, painterly, and, at, the, same, time, real, photographic, perspective, using, lenses, within, a, photographic, layer, united, in, colors, and, shapes, this, neumann, chemogram, from, the, seventies, of, the, 20th, century, thus, differs, from, the, beginning, of, the, previously, created, cameraless, chemigrams, of, a, pierre, cordier, and, the, photogram, man, ray, or, l, szl, moholy, nagy, of, the, previous, decades, these, works, of, art, were, almost, simultaneous, with, the, invention, of, photography, by, various, important, artists, who, characterized, hippolyte, bayard, thomas, wedgwood, william, henry, fox, talbot, in, their, early, stages, and, later, man, ray, and, l, szl, moholy, nagy, in, the, twenties, and, by, the, painter, in, the, thirties, edmund, kesting, and, christian, schad, by, draping, objects, directly, onto, appropriately, sensitized, photo, paper, and, using, a, light, source, without, a, camera, photojournalism, is, a, particular, form, of, photography, the, collecting, editing, and, presenting, of, news, material, for, publication, or, broadcast, that, employs, images, in, order, to, tell, a, news, story, it, is, now, usually, understood, to, refer, only, to, still, images, but, in, some, cases, the, term, also, refers, to, video, used, in, broadcast, journalism, photojournalism, is, distinguished, from, other, close, branches, of, photography, e, g, documentary, photography, social, documentary, photography, street, photography, or, celebrity, photography, by, complying, with, a, rigid, ethical, framework, which, demands, that, the, work, be, both, honest, and, impartial, whilst, telling, the, story, in, strictly, journalistic, terms, photojournalists, create, pictures, that, contribute, to, the, news, media, and, help, communities, connect, with, one, other, photojournalists, must, be, well, informed, and, knowledgeable, about, events, happening, right, outside, their, door, they, deliver, news, in, a, creative, format, that, is, not, only, informative, but, also, entertaining, including, sports, photography, the, camera, has, a, long, and, distinguished, history, as, a, means, of, recording, scientific, phenomena, from, the, first, use, by, daguerre, and, fox, talbot, such, as, astronomical, events, eclipses, for, example, small, creatures, and, plants, when, the, camera, was, attached, to, the, eyepiece, of, microscopes, in, photomicroscopy, and, for, macro, photography, of, larger, specimens, the, camera, also, proved, useful, in, recording, crime, scenes, and, the, scenes, of, accidents, such, as, the, wootton, bridge, collapse, in, 1861, the, methods, used, in, analysing, photographs, for, use, in, legal, cases, are, collectively, known, as, forensic, photography, crime, scene, photos, are, usually, taken, from, three, vantage, points, overview, mid, range, and, close, up, in, 1845, francis, ronalds, the, honorary, director, of, the, kew, observatory, invented, the, first, successful, camera, to, make, continuous, recordings, of, meteorological, and, geomagnetic, parameters, different, machines, produced, 12, or, 24, hour, photographic, traces, of, the, minute, by, minute, variations, of, atmospheric, pressure, temperature, humidity, atmospheric, electricity, and, the, three, components, of, geomagnetic, forces, the, cameras, were, supplied, to, numerous, observatories, around, the, world, and, some, remained, in, use, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, charles, brooke, a, little, later, developed, similar, instruments, for, the, greenwich, observatory, science, regularly, uses, image, technology, that, has, derived, from, the, design, of, the, pinhole, camera, to, avoid, distortions, that, can, be, caused, by, lenses, x, ray, machines, are, similar, in, design, to, pinhole, cameras, with, high, grade, filters, and, laser, radiation, photography, has, become, universal, in, recording, events, and, data, in, science, and, engineering, and, at, crime, scenes, or, accident, scenes, the, method, has, been, much, extended, by, using, other, wavelengths, such, as, infrared, photography, and, ultraviolet, photography, as, well, as, spectroscopy, those, methods, were, first, used, in, the, victorian, era, and, improved, much, further, since, that, time, the, first, photographed, atom, was, discovered, in, 2012, by, physicists, at, griffith, university, australia, they, used, an, electric, field, to, trap, an, ion, of, the, element, ytterbium, the, image, was, recorded, on, a, ccd, an, electronic, photographic, film, wildlife, photography, involves, capturing, images, of, various, forms, of, wildlife, unlike, other, forms, of, photography, such, as, product, or, food, photography, successful, wildlife, photography, requires, a, photographer, to, choose, the, right, place, and, right, time, when, specific, wildlife, are, present, and, active, it, often, requires, great, patience, and, considerable, skill, and, command, of, the, right, photographic, equipment, there, are, many, ongoing, questions, about, different, aspects, of, photography, in, her, on, photography, 1977, susan, sontag, dismisses, the, objectivity, of, photography, this, is, a, highly, debated, subject, within, the, photographic, community, sontag, argues, to, photograph, is, to, appropriate, the, thing, photographed, it, means, putting, one, s, self, into, a, certain, relation, to, the, world, that, feels, like, knowledge, and, therefore, like, power, photographers, decide, what, to, take, a, photo, of, what, elements, to, exclude, and, what, angle, to, frame, the, photo, and, these, factors, may, reflect, a, particular, socio, historical, context, along, these, lines, it, can, be, argued, that, photography, is, a, subjective, form, of, representation, modern, photography, has, raised, a, number, of, concerns, on, its, effect, on, society, in, alfred, hitchcock, s, rear, window, 1954, the, camera, is, presented, as, promoting, voyeurism, although, the, camera, is, an, observation, station, the, act, of, photographing, is, more, than, passive, observing, the, camera, doesn, t, rape, or, even, possess, though, it, may, presume, intrude, trespass, distort, exploit, and, at, the, farthest, reach, of, metaphor, assassinate, all, activities, that, unlike, the, sexual, push, and, shove, can, be, conducted, from, a, distance, and, with, some, detachment, digital, imaging, has, raised, ethical, concerns, because, of, the, ease, of, manipulating, digital, photographs, in, post, processing, many, photojournalists, have, declared, they, will, not, crop, their, pictures, or, are, forbidden, from, combining, elements, of, multiple, photos, to, make, photomontages, passing, them, as, real, photographs, today, s, technology, has, made, image, editing, relatively, simple, for, even, the, novice, photographer, however, recent, changes, of, in, camera, processing, allow, digital, fingerprinting, of, photos, to, detect, tampering, for, purposes, of, forensic, photography, photography, is, one, of, the, new, media, forms, that, changes, perception, and, changes, the, structure, of, society, further, unease, has, been, caused, around, cameras, in, regards, to, desensitization, fears, that, disturbing, or, explicit, images, are, widely, accessible, to, children, and, society, at, large, have, been, raised, particularly, photos, of, war, and, pornography, are, causing, a, stir, sontag, is, concerned, that, to, photograph, is, to, turn, people, into, objects, that, can, be, symbolically, possessed, desensitization, discussion, goes, hand, in, hand, with, debates, about, censored, images, sontag, writes, of, her, concern, that, the, ability, to, censor, pictures, means, the, photographer, has, the, ability, to, construct, reality, one, of, the, practices, through, which, photography, constitutes, society, is, tourism, tourism, and, photography, combine, to, create, a, tourist, gaze, in, which, local, inhabitants, are, positioned, and, defined, by, the, camera, lens, however, it, has, also, been, argued, that, there, exists, a, reverse, gaze, through, which, indigenous, photographees, can, position, the, tourist, photographer, as, a, shallow, consumer, of, images, photography, is, both, restricted, and, protected, by, the, law, in, many, jurisdictions, protection, of, photographs, is, typically, achieved, through, the, granting, of, copyright, or, moral, rights, to, the, photographer, in, the, united, states, photography, is, protected, as, a, first, amendment, right, and, anyone, is, free, to, photograph, anything, seen, in, public, spaces, as, long, as, it, is, in, plain, view, in, the, uk, a, recent, law, counter, terrorism, act, 2008, increases, the, power, of, the, police, to, prevent, people, even, press, photographers, from, taking, pictures, in, public, places, in, south, africa, any, person, may, photograph, any, other, person, without, their, permission, in, public, spaces, and, the, only, specific, restriction, placed, on, what, may, not, be, photographed, by, government, is, related, to, anything, classed, as, national, security, each, country, has, different, laws
