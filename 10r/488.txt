a, chariot, is, a, type, of, cart, driven, by, a, charioteer, usually, using, horses, to, provide, rapid, motive, power, the, oldest, known, chariots, have, been, found, in, burials, of, the, sintashta, culture, in, modern, day, chelyabinsk, oblast, russia, dated, to, c, 1950, 1880, bce, and, are, depicted, on, cylinder, seals, from, central, anatolia, in, k, ltepe, dated, to, c, 1900, bce, the, critical, invention, that, allowed, the, construction, of, light, horse, drawn, chariots, was, the, spoked, wheel, the, chariot, was, a, fast, light, open, two, wheeled, conveyance, drawn, by, two, or, more, equids, usually, horses, that, were, hitched, side, by, side, and, was, little, more, than, a, floor, with, a, waist, high, guard, at, the, front, and, sides, it, was, initially, used, for, ancient, warfare, during, the, bronze, and, iron, ages, but, after, its, military, capabilities, had, been, superseded, by, light, and, heavy, cavalries, chariots, continued, to, be, used, for, travel, and, transport, in, processions, for, games, and, in, races, the, word, chariot, comes, from, the, latin, term, carrus, a, loanword, from, gaulish, karros, in, ancient, rome, a, biga, described, a, chariot, requiring, two, horses, a, triga, three, and, a, quadriga, four, the, wheel, may, have, been, invented, at, several, places, with, early, evidence, found, in, ukraine, poland, germany, and, slovenia, evidence, of, wheeled, vehicles, appears, from, the, mid, 4th, millennium, bc, near, simultaneously, in, the, northern, caucasus, maykop, culture, and, in, central, europe, these, earliest, vehicles, may, have, been, ox, carts, a, necessary, precursor, to, the, invention, of, the, chariot, is, the, domestication, of, animals, and, specifically, domestication, of, horses, a, major, step, in, the, development, of, civilization, despite, the, large, impact, horse, domestication, has, had, in, transport, and, communication, tracing, its, origins, has, been, challenging, evidence, supports, horses, having, been, domesticated, in, the, eurasian, steppes, with, studies, suggesting, the, botai, culture, in, modern, day, kazakhstan, were, the, first, about, 3500, bce, others, say, horses, were, domesticated, earlier, than, 3500, bce, in, eastern, europe, modern, ukraine, and, western, kazakhstan, 6000, years, ago, the, spread, of, spoke, wheeled, chariots, has, been, closely, associated, with, early, indo, iranian, migrations, the, earliest, known, chariots, have, been, found, in, sintashta, culture, burial, sites, and, the, culture, is, considered, a, strong, candidate, for, the, origin, of, the, technology, which, spread, throughout, the, old, world, and, played, an, important, role, in, ancient, warfare, it, is, also, strongly, associated, with, the, ancestors, of, modern, domestic, horses, the, dom2, population, dom2, horses, originated, from, the, western, eurasia, steppes, especially, the, lower, volga, don, but, not, in, anatolia, during, the, late, fourth, and, early, third, millennia, bce, their, genes, may, show, selection, for, easier, domestication, and, stronger, backs, these, aryan, people, migrated, southward, into, south, asia, ushering, in, the, vedic, period, around, 1750, bce, shortly, after, this, about, 1700, bce, evidence, of, chariots, appears, in, asia, minor, the, earliest, fully, developed, spoke, wheeled, horse, chariots, are, from, the, chariot, burials, of, the, andronovo, timber, grave, sites, of, the, sintashta, petrovka, proto, indo, iranian, culture, in, modern, russia, and, kazakhstan, from, around, 2000, bce, this, culture, is, at, least, partially, derived, from, the, earlier, yamna, culture, it, built, heavily, fortified, settlements, engaged, in, bronze, metallurgy, on, an, industrial, scale, and, practiced, complex, burial, rituals, reminiscent, of, hindu, rituals, known, from, the, rigveda, and, the, avesta, over, the, next, few, centuries, the, andronovo, culture, spread, across, the, steppes, from, the, urals, to, the, tien, shan, likely, corresponding, to, the, time, of, early, indo, iranian, cultures, not, everyone, agrees, that, the, sintashta, culture, vehicle, finds, are, true, chariots, in, 1996, joost, crouwel, and, mary, aiken, littauer, wrote, let, us, consider, what, is, actually, known, of, the, sintashta, and, krivoe, ozero, vehicles, at, sintashta, there, remained, only, the, imprints, of, the, lower, parts, of, the, wheels, in, their, slots, in, the, floor, of, the, burial, chamber, krivoe, ozero, also, preserved, imprints, of, parts, of, the, axle, and, naves, at, sintashta, the, wheel, tracks, and, their, position, relative, to, the, walls, of, the, tomb, chamber, limited, the, dimensions, of, the, naves, hence, the, stability, of, the, vehicle, ancient, naves, were, symmetrical, the, part, outside, the, spokes, of, equal, length, to, that, inside, the, present, reconstructions, of, the, sintashta, and, krivoe, ozero, vehicles, above, the, axle, level, raise, many, doubts, and, questions, but, one, cannot, argue, about, something, for, which, there, is, no, evidence, it, is, from, the, wheel, track, measurements, and, the, dimensions, and, positions, of, the, wheels, alone, that, we, may, legitimately, draw, conclusions, and, these, are, alone, sufficient, to, establish, that, the, sintashta, petrovka, vehicles, would, not, be, manoeuverable, enough, for, use, either, in, warfare, or, in, racing, peter, raulwing, and, stefan, burmeister, consider, the, sintashta, and, krivoe, ozero, finds, from, the, steppe, to, be, carts, rather, than, chariots, however, recent, discoveries, in, the, eurasian, steppe, have, provided, fresh, support, to, the, claim, that, the, chariot, originated, there, rather, than, in, the, near, east, itself, and, may, be, attributed, to, speakers, of, an, indo, iranian, or, indo, aryan, language, in, particular, archaeological, remains, of, horse, gear, and, spoked, wheeled, vehicles, have, been, found, at, the, sites, of, sintashta, russia, and, krivoe, ozero, northern, kazakhstan, with, calibrated, radiocarbon, dating, to, ca, 2000, 1800, these, finds, however, provide, evidence, of, a, two, wheeled, spoked, cart, that, does, not, fit, the, definition, of, the, ancient, near, eastern, chariot, before, these, discoveries, can, help, answer, the, question, of, where, the, chariot, originated, thorough, studies, of, the, spoked, wheeled, vehicles, and, horse, gear, of, the, steppes, as, well, as, of, interconnections, and, transfer, of, knowledge, are, necessary, cf, epimachov, and, korjakova, in, fansa, and, burmeister, 2004, chariots, figure, prominently, in, indo, iranian, mythology, chariots, are, also, an, important, part, of, both, hindu, and, persian, mythology, with, most, of, the, gods, in, their, pantheon, portrayed, as, riding, them, the, sanskrit, word, for, a, chariot, is, r, tha, m, which, is, cognate, with, avestan, ra, a, also, m, and, in, origin, a, substantiation, of, the, adjective, proto, indo, european, rot, h, meaning, having, wheels, with, the, characteristic, accent, shift, found, in, indo, iranian, substantivisations, this, adjective, is, in, turn, derived, from, the, collective, noun, rot, eh, wheels, continued, in, latin, rota, which, belongs, to, the, noun, r, t, o, for, wheel, from, ret, to, run, that, is, also, found, in, germanic, celtic, and, baltic, old, high, german, rad, n, old, irish, roth, m, lithuanian, r, tas, m, nomadic, tribes, of, the, pontic, steppes, like, scythians, such, as, hamaxobii, would, travel, in, wagons, carts, and, chariots, during, their, migrations, the, oldest, testimony, of, chariot, warfare, in, the, ancient, near, east, is, the, old, hittite, anitta, text, 18th, century, bce, which, mentions, 40, teams, of, horses, in, the, original, cuneiform, spelling, 40, im, ti, an, e, kur, ra, i, a, at, the, siege, of, salatiwara, since, the, text, mentions, teams, rather, than, chariots, the, existence, of, chariots, in, the, 18th, century, bce, is, uncertain, the, first, certain, attestation, of, chariots, in, the, hittite, empire, dates, to, the, late, 17th, century, bce, hattusili, i, a, hittite, horse, training, text, is, attributed, to, kikkuli, the, mitanni, 15th, century, bce, the, hittites, were, renowned, charioteers, they, developed, a, new, chariot, design, that, had, lighter, wheels, with, four, spokes, rather, than, eight, and, that, held, three, rather, than, two, warriors, it, could, hold, three, warriors, because, the, wheel, was, placed, in, the, middle, of, the, chariot, and, not, at, the, back, as, in, egyptian, chariots, typically, one, hittite, warrior, steered, the, chariot, while, the, second, man, was, usually, the, main, archer, the, third, warrior, would, either, wield, a, spear, or, sword, when, charging, at, enemies, or, hold, up, a, large, shield, to, protect, himself, and, the, others, from, enemy, arrows, hittite, prosperity, largely, depended, on, their, control, of, trade, routes, and, natural, resources, specifically, metals, as, the, hittites, gained, dominion, over, mesopotamia, tensions, flared, among, the, neighboring, assyrians, hurrians, and, egyptians, under, suppiluliuma, i, the, hittites, conquered, kadesh, and, eventually, the, whole, of, syria, the, battle, of, kadesh, in, 1274, bce, is, likely, to, have, been, the, largest, chariot, battle, ever, fought, involving, over, 5, 000, chariots, models, of, single, axled, solid, wheeled, ox, drawn, vehicles, have, been, found, at, several, mature, indus, valley, cites, such, as, chanhudaro, daimabad, harappa, and, nausharo, spoked, wheeled, horse, drawn, chariots, often, carrying, an, armed, passenger, are, depicted, in, second, millennium, bce, chalcolithic, period, rock, paintings, examples, are, known, from, chibbar, nulla, chhatur, bhoj, nath, nulla, and, kathotia, there, are, some, depictions, of, chariots, among, the, petroglyphs, in, the, sandstone, of, the, vindhya, range, two, depictions, of, chariots, are, found, in, morhana, pahar, mirzapur, district, one, depicts, a, biga, and, the, head, of, the, driver, the, second, depicts, a, quadriga, with, six, spoked, wheels, and, a, driver, standing, up, in, a, large, chariot, box, this, chariot, is, being, attacked, one, figure, who, is, armed, with, a, shield, and, a, mace, stands, in, the, chariot, s, path, another, figure, who, is, armed, with, a, bow, and, arrow, threatens, the, right, flank, it, has, been, suggested, speculated, that, the, drawings, record, a, story, most, probably, dating, to, the, early, centuries, bce, from, some, center, in, the, area, of, the, ganges, yamuna, plain, into, the, territory, of, still, neolithic, hunting, tribes, the, very, realistic, chariots, carved, into, the, sanchi, stupas, are, dated, to, roughly, the, 1st, century, bronze, age, solid, disk, wheel, carts, were, found, in, 2018, at, sinauli, which, were, interpreted, by, some, as, horse, pulled, chariots, predating, the, arrival, of, the, horse, centered, indo, aryans, they, were, ascribed, by, sanjay, manjul, director, of, the, excavations, to, the, ochre, coloured, pottery, culture, ocp, copper, hoard, culture, which, was, contemporaneous, with, the, late, harappan, culture, and, interpreted, by, him, as, horse, pulled, chariots, majul, further, noted, that, the, rituals, relating, to, the, sanauli, burials, showed, close, affinity, with, vedic, rituals, and, stated, that, the, dating, of, the, mahabharata, is, around, 1750, bce, according, to, asko, parpola, these, finds, were, ox, pulled, carts, indicating, that, these, burials, are, related, to, an, early, aryan, migration, of, proto, indo, iranian, speaking, people, into, the, indian, subcontinent, forming, then, the, ruling, elite, of, a, major, late, harappan, settlement, horse, drawn, chariots, as, well, as, their, cult, and, associated, rituals, were, spread, by, the, indo, iranians, and, horses, and, horse, drawn, chariots, were, introduced, in, india, by, the, indo, aryans, in, rigveda, indra, is, described, as, strong, willed, armed, with, a, thunderbolt, riding, a, chariot, may, the, strong, heaven, make, thee, the, strong, wax, stronger, strong, for, thou, art, borne, by, thy, two, strong, bay, horses, so,

and, men, the, jain, bhagavi, sutra, states, that, indian, troops, used, a, chariot, with, a, club, or, mace, attached, to, it, during, the, war, against, the, licchavis, during, the, reign, of, ajatashatru, of, magadha, the, persians, succeeded, elam, in, the, mid, 1st, millennium, they, may, have, been, the, first, to, yoke, four, horses, to, their, chariots, they, also, used, scythed, chariots, cyrus, the, younger, employed, these, chariots, in, large, numbers, at, the, battle, of, cunaxa, herodotus, mentions, that, the, ancient, libyan, and, the, ancient, indian, sattagydia, gandhara, and, hindush, satrapies, supplied, cavalry, and, chariots, to, xerxes, the, great, s, army, however, by, this, time, cavalry, was, far, more, effective, and, agile, than, the, chariot, and, the, defeat, of, darius, iii, at, the, battle, of, gaugamela, 331, bce, where, the, army, of, alexander, simply, opened, their, lines, and, let, the, chariots, pass, and, attacked, them, from, behind, marked, the, end, of, the, era, of, chariot, warfare, barring, the, seleucid, and, pontic, powers, india, china, and, the, celtic, peoples, chariots, were, introduced, in, the, near, east, in, the, 17, 18, th, 16th, centuries, bce, some, scholars, argue, that, the, horse, chariot, was, most, likely, a, product, of, the, ancient, near, east, early, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, archaeologist, joost, crouwel, writes, that, chariots, were, not, sudden, inventions, but, developed, out, of, earlier, vehicles, that, were, mounted, on, disk, or, cross, bar, wheels, this, development, can, best, be, traced, in, the, near, east, where, spoke, wheeled, and, horse, drawn, chariots, are, first, attested, in, the, earlier, part, of, the, second, millennium, bce, and, were, illustrated, on, a, syrian, cylinder, seal, dated, to, either, the, 18th, or, 17th, century, bce, according, to, christoph, baumer, the, earliest, discoveries, of, wheels, in, mesopotamia, come, from, the, first, half, of, the, third, millennium, bce, more, than, half, a, millennium, later, than, the, first, finds, from, the, kuban, region, at, the, same, time, in, mesopotamia, some, intriguing, early, pictograms, of, a, sled, that, rests, on, wooden, rollers, or, wheels, have, been, found, they, date, from, about, the, same, time, as, the, early, wheel, discoveries, in, europe, and, may, indicate, knowledge, of, the, wheel, the, earliest, depiction, of, vehicles, in, the, context, of, warfare, is, on, the, standard, of, ur, in, southern, mesopotamia, c, 2500, bce, these, are, more, properly, called, wagons, which, were, double, axled, and, pulled, by, oxen, or, a, hybrid, of, a, donkey, and, a, female, onager, named, kunga, in, the, city, of, nagar, which, was, famous, for, breeding, them, the, hybrids, were, used, by, the, eblaite, early, sumerian, akkadian, and, ur, iii, armies, although, sometimes, carrying, a, spearman, with, the, charioteer, driver, such, heavy, wagons, borne, on, solid, wooden, wheels, and, covered, with, skins, may, have, been, part, of, the, baggage, train, e, g, during, royal, funeral, processions, rather, than, vehicles, of, battle, in, themselves, the, sumerians, had, a, lighter, two, wheeled, type, of, cart, pulled, by, four, asses, and, with, solid, wheels, the, spoked, wheel, did, not, appear, in, mesopotamia, until, the, mid, second, millennium, bce, chariot, use, made, its, way, into, egypt, around, 1650, bce, during, the, hyksos, invasion, of, egypt, and, establishment, of, the, fourteenth, dynasty, in, 1659, bce, the, indo, european, hittites, sacked, babylon, which, demonstrated, the, superiority, of, chariots, in, antiquity, the, chariot, and, horse, were, used, extensively, in, egypt, by, the, hyksos, invaders, from, the, 16th, century, bce, onwards, though, discoveries, announced, in, 2013, potentially, place, the, earliest, chariot, use, as, early, as, egypt, s, old, kingdom, c, 2686, 2181, bce, in, the, remains, of, egyptian, and, assyrian, art, there, are, numerous, representations, of, chariots, which, display, rich, ornamentation, the, chariots, of, the, egyptians, and, assyrians, with, whom, the, bow, was, the, principal, arm, of, attack, were, richly, mounted, with, quivers, full, of, arrows, the, egyptians, invented, the, yoke, saddle, for, their, chariot, horses, in, c, 1500, bce, as, a, general, rule, the, egyptians, used, chariots, as, mobile, archery, platforms, chariots, always, had, two, men, with, the, driver, steering, the, chariot, with, his, reins, while, the, main, archer, aimed, his, bow, and, arrow, at, any, targets, within, range, the, best, preserved, examples, of, egyptian, chariots, are, the, four, specimens, from, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, chariots, can, be, pulled, by, two, or, more, horses, chariots, are, frequently, mentioned, in, the, hebrew, tanakh, and, the, greek, old, testament, respectively, particularly, by, the, prophets, as, instruments, of, war, or, as, symbols, of, power, or, glory, first, mentioned, in, the, story, of, joseph, genesis, 50, 9, iron, chariots, are, mentioned, also, in, joshua, 17, 16, 18, and, judges, 1, 19, 4, 3, 13, as, weapons, of, the, canaanites, and, israelites, 1, samuel, 13, 5, mentions, chariots, of, the, philistines, who, are, sometimes, identified, with, the, sea, peoples, or, early, greeks, examples, from, the, jewish, study, bible, of, the, tanakh, jewish, bible, include, examples, from, the, king, james, version, of, the, christian, bible, include, small, domestic, horses, may, have, been, present, in, the, northern, negev, before, 3000, bce, jezreel, city, has, been, identified, as, the, chariot, base, of, king, ahab, and, a, decorated, bronze, tablet, thought, to, be, the, head, of, a, lynchpin, of, a, canaanite, chariot, was, found, at, a, site, that, may, be, sisera, s, fortress, harosheth, haggoyim, in, urartu, 860, 590, bce, the, chariot, was, used, by, both, the, nobility, and, the, military, in, erebuni, yerevan, king, argishti, of, urartu, is, depicted, riding, on, a, chariot, which, is, pulled, by, two, horses, the, chariot, has, two, wheels, and, each, wheel, has, about, eight, spokes, this, type, of, chariot, was, used, around, 800, bce, as, david, w, anthony, writes, in, his, book, the, horse, the, wheel, and, language, in, eastern, europe, the, earliest, well, dated, depiction, of, a, wheeled, vehicle, a, wagon, with, two, axles, and, four, wheels, is, on, the, bronocice, pot, c, 3500, bce, it, is, a, clay, pot, excavated, in, a, funnelbeaker, settlement, in, swietokrzyskie, voivodeship, in, poland, the, oldest, securely, dated, real, wheel, axle, combination, in, eastern, europe, is, the, ljubljana, marshes, wheel, c, 3150, bce, the, later, greeks, of, the, first, millennium, bce, had, a, still, not, very, effective, cavalry, arm, indeed, it, has, been, argued, that, these, early, horseback, riding, soldiers, may, have, given, rise, to, the, development, of, the, later, heavily, armed, foot, soldiers, known, as, hoplites, and, the, rocky, terrain, of, the, greek, mainland, was, unsuited, for, wheeled, vehicles, the, chariot, was, heavily, used, by, the, mycaenean, greeks, most, probably, adopted, from, the, hittites, around, 1600, bce, linear, b, tablets, from, mycenaean, palaces, record, large, inventories, of, chariots, sometimes, with, specific, details, as, to, how, many, chariots, were, assembled, or, not, i, e, stored, in, modular, form, on, a, gravestone, from, the, royal, shaft, grave, v, in, mycenae, dated, lh, ii, about, 1500, bce, there, is, one, of, the, earliest, depiction, of, the, chariot, in, achaean, art, this, sculpture, shows, a, single, man, driving, a, two, wheeled, small, box, chariot, later, the, vehicles, were, used, in, games, and, processions, notably, for, races, at, the, olympic, and, panathenaic, games, and, other, public, festivals, in, ancient, greece, in, hippodromes, and, in, contests, called, agons, they, were, also, used, in, ceremonial, functions, as, when, a, paranymph, or, friend, of, a, bridegroom, went, with, him, in, a, chariot, to, fetch, the, bride, home, herodotus, histories, 5, 9, reports, that, chariots, were, widely, used, in, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, by, the, sigynnae, greek, chariots, were, made, to, be, drawn, by, two, horses, attached, to, a, central, pole, if, two, additional, horses, were, added, they, were, attached, on, each, side, of, the, main, pair, by, a, single, bar, or, trace, fastened, to, the, front, or, prow, of, the, chariot, as, may, be, seen, on, two, prize, vases, in, the, british, museum, from, the, panathenaic, games, at, athens, greece, in, which, the, driver, is, seated, with, feet, resting, on, a, board, hanging, down, in, front, close, to, the, legs, of, the, horses, the, biga, itself, consists, of, a, seat, resting, on, the, axle, with, a, rail, at, each, side, to, protect, the, driver, from, the, wheels, greek, chariots, appear, to, have, lacked, any, other, attachment, for, the, horses, which, would, have, made, turning, difficult, the, body, or, basket, of, the, chariot, rested, directly, on, the, axle, called, beam, connecting, the, two, wheels, there, was, no, suspension, making, this, an, uncomfortable, form, of, transport, at, the, front, and, sides, of, the, basket, was, a, semicircular, guard, about, 3, ft, 1, m, high, to, give, some, protection, from, enemy, attack, at, the, back, the, basket, was, open, making, it, easy, to, mount, and, dismount, there, was, no, seat, and, generally, only, enough, room, for, the, driver, and, one, passenger, the, reins, were, mostly, the, same, as, those, in, use, in, the, 19th, century, and, were, made, of, leather, and, ornamented, with, studs, of, ivory, or, metal, the, reins, were, passed, through, rings, attached, to, the, collar, bands, or, yoke, and, were, long, enough, to, be, tied, round, the, waist, of, the, charioteer, to, allow, for, defense, the, wheels, and, basket, of, the, chariot, were, usually, of, wood, strengthened, in, places, with, bronze, or, iron, the, wheels, had, from, four, to, eight, spokes, and, tires, of, bronze, or, iron, due, to, the, widely, spaced, spokes, the, rim, of, the, chariot, wheel, was, held, in, tension, over, comparatively, large, spans, whilst, this, provided, a, small, measure, of, shock, absorption, it, also, necessitated, the, removal, of, the, wheels, when, the, chariot, was, not, in, use, to, prevent, warping, from, continued, weight, bearing, most, other, nations, of, this, time, had, chariots, of, similar, design, to, the, greeks, the, chief, differences, being, the, mountings, according, to, greek, mythology, the, chariot, was, invented, by, erichthonius, of, athens, to, conceal, his, feet, which, were, those, of, a, dragon, the, most, notable, appearance, of, the, chariot, in, greek, mythology, occurs, when, pha, ton, the, son, of, helios, in, an, attempt, to, drive, the, chariot, of, the, sun, managed, to, set, the, earth, on, fire, this, story, led, to, the, archaic, meaning, of, a, phaeton, as, one, who, drives, a, chariot, or, coach, especially, at, a, reckless, or, dangerous, speed, plato, in, his, chariot, allegory, depicted, a, chariot, drawn, by, two, horses, one, well, behaved, and, the, other, troublesome, representing, opposite, impulses, of, human, nature, the, task, of, the, charioteer, representing, reason, was, to, stop, the, horses, from, going, different, ways, and, to, guide, them, towards,
