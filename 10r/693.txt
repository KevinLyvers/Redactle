the, mass, rapid, transit, system, locally, known, by, the, initialism, mrt, is, a, rapid, transit, system, in, singapore, and, the, island, country, s, principal, mode, of, railway, transportation, the, system, commenced, operations, in, november, 1987, after, two, decades, of, planning, with, an, initial, 6, km, 3, 7, mi, stretch, consisting, of, five, stations, the, network, has, since, grown, to, span, the, length, and, breadth, of, the, country, s, main, island, with, the, exception, of, the, forested, core, and, the, rural, northwestern, region, in, accordance, with, singapore, s, aim, of, developing, a, comprehensive, rail, network, as, the, backbone, of, the, country, s, public, transportation, system, averaging, a, daily, ridership, of, 3, 45, million, in, 2023, the, mrt, network, encompasses, approximately, 241, km, 150, mi, of, grade, separated, route, on, standard, gauge, as, of, 2024, there, are, currently, 141, operational, stations, dispersed, across, six, operational, lines, arrayed, in, a, circle, radial, topology, two, more, lines, and, 46, stations, are, currently, under, construction, in, addition, to, ongoing, extension, works, on, existing, lines, in, total, this, will, schedule, the, network, to, double, in, length, to, about, 460, km, 290, mi, by, 2040, further, studies, are, ongoing, on, potential, new, alignments, and, lines, as, well, as, infill, stations, in, the, land, transport, authority, s, lta, land, transport, masterplan, 2040, the, island, wide, heavy, rail, network, interchanges, with, a, series, of, automated, guideway, transit, networks, localised, to, select, suburban, towns, collectively, known, as, the, light, rail, transit, lrt, system, which, along, with, public, buses, complement, the, mainline, by, providing, a, last, mile, link, between, mrt, stations, and, hdb, public, housing, estates, the, mrt, is, the, oldest, busiest, and, most, comprehensive, metro, system, in, southeast, asia, capital, expenditure, on, its, rail, infrastructure, reached, a, cumulative, s, 150, billion, in, 2021, making, the, network, one, of, the, world, s, costliest, on, both, a, per, kilometre, and, absolute, basis, the, system, is, managed, in, conformity, with, a, semi, nationalised, hybrid, regulatory, framework, construction, and, procurement, fall, under, the, purview, of, the, land, transport, authority, lta, a, statutory, board, of, the, government, that, allocates, operating, concessions, to, the, for, profit, private, corporations, smrt, and, sbs, transit, these, operators, are, responsible, for, asset, maintenance, on, their, respective, lines, and, also, run, bus, services, facilitating, operational, synchronicity, and, the, horizontal, integration, of, the, broader, public, transportation, network, the, mrt, is, fully, automated, and, has, an, extensive, driverless, rapid, transit, system, asset, renewal, works, are, periodically, carried, out, to, modernise, the, network, and, ensure, its, continued, reliability, all, stations, feature, platform, screen, doors, wi, fi, connectivity, lifts, climate, control, and, accessibility, provisions, among, others, much, of, the, early, network, is, elevated, above, ground, on, concrete, viaducts, with, a, small, portion, running, at, grade, newer, lines, are, largely, subterranean, incorporating, several, of, the, lengthiest, continuous, subway, tunnel, sections, in, the, world, a, number, of, underground, stations, double, as, purpose, built, air, raid, shelters, under, the, operational, authority, of, the, singapore, civil, defence, force, scdf, these, stations, incorporate, deep, level, station, boxes, cast, with, hardened, concrete, and, blast, doors, fashioned, out, of, reinforced, steel, to, withstand, conventional, aerial, and, chemical, ordnance, the, origins, of, the, mass, rapid, transit, mrt, were, derived, from, a, forecast, by, the, country, s, planners, back, in, 1967, which, stated, the, need, for, a, rail, based, urban, transport, system, by, 1992, in, 1972, a, study, was, conducted, by, the, american, firms, wilbur, smith, and, associates, and, parsons, brinckerhoss, tudor, and, bechtel, which, was, accounted, for, by, the, world, bank, on, behalf, of, the, united, nations, development, programme, the, study, was, undertaken, for, eight, years, including, the, phases, of, the, study, in, 1974, and, 1977, in, 1979, to, prepare, the, third, phase, of, the, study, halcrow, a, british, firm, was, appointed, to, craft, the, system, meanwhile, a, third, phase, of, the, study, was, published, in, 1981, however, opposition, from, the, government, on, the, feasibility, of, the, mrt, from, prominent, ministers, among, them, finance, minister, goh, keng, swee, and, trades, and, industry, minister, tony, tan, nearly, shuttered, the, program, due, to, financial, grounds, and, concerns, of, jobs, saturation, in, the, construction, industry, dr, goh, instead, endorsed, the, idea, of, an, all, bus, system, recommended, by, harvard, university, specialists, who, argued, would, reduce, the, cost, by, 50, compared, to, the, proposed, mrt, system, public, opinion, was, split, on, the, matter, with, several, expressing, concerns, on, the, high, cost, and, others, being, more, focused, on, increasing, the, standard, of, living, following, a, debate, on, whether, a, bus, only, system, would, be, more, cost, effective, communications, minister, ong, teng, cheong, came, to, the, conclusion, that, an, all, bus, system, would, be, inadequate, as, it, would, have, to, compete, for, road, space, in, a, land, scarce, country, ong, was, an, architect, and, town, planner, by, training, and, through, his, perseverance, and, dedication, became, the, main, figure, behind, the, initial, construction, of, the, system, an, mrt, system, designs, option, study, was, also, conducted, to, refine, the, technical, details, and, the, recommended, measures, for, the, mrt, system, such, as, having, platform, screen, doors, at, underground, stations, and, utilizing, the, third, rail, for, power, transmission, singapore, s, mrt, infrastructure, is, built, operated, and, managed, in, accordance, with, a, hybridised, quasi, nationalised, regulatory, framework, called, the, new, rail, financing, framework, nrff, in, which, the, lines, are, constructed, and, the, assets, owned, by, the, land, transport, authority, a, statutory, board, of, the, government, of, singapore, the, network, was, planned, to, be, constructed, and, opened, in, stages, even, as, plans, had, already, indicated, the, decision, for, two, main, arterial, lines, the, north, south, line, was, given, priority, because, it, passed, through, the, central, area, that, has, a, high, demand, for, public, transport, de, leuw, cather, was, appointed, to, undertake, a, two, year, contract, for, consultancy, in, november, 1982, the, mass, rapid, transit, corporation, mrtc, later, renamed, smrt, corporation, was, established, on, 14, october, 1983, and, took, over, the, roles, and, responsibilities, of, the, former, provisional, mass, rapid, transit, authority, on, 7, november, 1987, the, first, section, of, the, north, south, line, started, operations, consisting, of, five, stations, over, six, kilometres, within, a, year, 20, more, stations, had, been, added, to, the, network, and, a, direct, service, existed, between, yishun, and, lakeside, stations, linking, up, central, singapore, to, jurong, in, the, west, by, the, end, of, 1988, the, direct, service, was, eventually, split, into, the, north, south, and, east, west, lines, after, the, latter, s, completion, of, the, eastern, sector, to, tanah, merah, station, by, the, end, of, 1990, the, branch, line, has, further, linked, choa, chu, kang, to, the, network, while, the, inauguration, of, boon, lay, station, on, 6, july, 1990, marked, the, completion, of, the, initial, system, two, years, ahead, of, schedule, the, mrt, has, been, continuously, expanded, ever, since, on, 10, february, 1996, a, s, 1, 2, billion, expansion, of, the, north, south, line, into, woodlands, was, completed, merging, the, branch, line, into, the, north, south, line, and, joining, yishun, and, choa, chu, kang, stations, the, concept, of, having, rail, lines, that, bring, people, almost, directly, to, their, homes, led, to, the, introduction, of, the, light, rail, transit, lrt, lines, connecting, with, the, mrt, network, on, 6, november, 1999, the, first, lrt, trains, on, the, bukit, panjang, lrt, went, into, operation, the, expo, and, changi, airport, stations, were, opened, on, 10, january, 2001, and, 8, february, 2002, respectively, the, very, first, infill, station, of, the, mrt, network, to, be, built, on, an, existing, line, dover, station, opened, on, 18, october, 2001, the, north, east, line, the, first, line, operated, by, sbs, transit, opened, on, 20, june, 2003, is, one, of, the, first, fully, automated, heavy, rail, lines, in, the, world, on, 15, january, 2006, after, intense, two, and, a, half, years, lobbying, by, the, public, buangkok, station, was, opened, followed, by, woodleigh, station, much, later, on, 20, june, 2011, the, boon, lay, extension, of, the, east, west, line, consisting, of, pioneer, and, joo, koon, stations, opened, on, 28, february, 2009, the, circle, line, opened, in, four, stages, with, stage, 3, on, 28, may, 2009, stages, 1, and, 2, on, 17, april, 2010, stages, 4, and, 5, on, 8, october, 2011, and, the, marina, bay, extension, on, 14, january, 2012, stage, 1, of, downtown, line, opened, on, 22, december, 2013, with, its, official, opening, made, on, 21, december, 2013, by, prime, minister, lee, hsien, loong, stage, 2, opened, on, 27, december, 2015, after, being, officially, opened, on, 26, december, by, prime, minister, lee, the, tuas, west, extension, of, the, east, west, line, consisting, of, gul, circle, tuas, crescent, tuas, west, road, and, tuas, link, stations, opened, on, 18, june, 2017, stage, 3, the, final, stage, of, the, downtown, line, opened, on, 21, october, 2017, with, its, official, opening, made, on, 20, october, 2017, by, coordinating, minister, for, infrastructure, and, minister, for, transport, khaw, boon, wan, the, second, infill, station, canberra, station, opened, on, 2, november, 2019, stage, 1, of, the, thomson, east, coast, line, opened, on, 31, january, 2020, stage, 2, of, the, thomson, east, coast, line, opened, on, 28, august, 2021, extending, the, line, from, woodlands, south, to, caldecott, stage, 3, of, the, thomson, east, coast, line, opened, on, 13, november, 2022, extending, the, line, from, caldecott, to, gardens, by, the, bay, on, 23, june, 2024, the, line, was, extended, eastwards, terminating, at, bayshore, the, lines, are, named, based, on, their, directions, and, or, locations, the, names, were, envisioned, to, be, user, friendly, as, shown, in, a, survey, in, which, 70, of, the, respondents, expressed, such, a, preference, the, land, transport, authority, lta, had, considered, other, naming, methods, in, june, 2007, whether, by, name, colour, or, numbers, after, the, survey, however, the, naming, scheme, was, retained, and, used, for, subsequent, future, mrt, lines, except, for, the, partly, at, grade, bishan, mrt, station, north, south, line, the, entirety, of, the, mrt, is, either, elevated, or, underground, most, below, ground, stations, are, deep, and, hardened, enough, to, withstand, conventional, aerial, bomb, attacks, and, to, serve, as, bomb, shelters, mobile, phone, 3g, 4g, and, 5g, services, are, available, in, every, part, of, the, network, underground, stations, and, trains, are, air, conditioned, while, above, ground, stations, have, ceiling, fans, installed, every, station, is, equipped, with, general, ticketing, machines, gtms, a, passenger, service, centre, and, led, or, plasma, displays, that, show, train, service, information, and, announcements, all, stations, are, equipped, with, restrooms, and, payphones, some, restrooms, are, located, at, street, level, some, stations, especially, the, major, ones, have, additional, amenities, and, services, such, as, retail, shops, and, kiosks, supermarkets, convenience, stores, automatic, teller, machines, and, self, service, automated, kiosks, for, a, variety, of, services, most, heavy, duty, escalators, at, stations, carry, passengers, up, or, down, at, a, rate, of, 0, 75, m, s, which, is, 50, faster, than, conventional, escalators, the, land, transport, authority, lta, announced, a, plan, to, introduce, dual, speeds, to, escalators, along, the, north, south, and, east, west, lines, to, make, it, safer, for, senior, citizens, using, them, as, a, result, all, escalators, on, the, two, lines, through, a, refurbishment, programme, will, be, able, to, operate, at, a, different, speed, of, 0, 5, m, s, during, off, peak, hours, with, completion, being, targeted, for, 2022, all, stations, constructed, before, 2001, initially, lacked, barrier, free, facilities, and, wider, afc, faregates, such, as, lifts, ramps, and, tactile, guidance, systems, for, the, elderly, and, disabled, a, retrofitting, programme, was, completed, in, 2006, with, every, station, provided, with, at, least, one, barrier, free, access, route, over, the, years, additional, barrier, free, facilities, have, been, constructed, in, stations, since, 2020, newer, mrt, stations, have, been, fitted, with, a, minimum, of, two, lifts, operators, and, authorities, have, stated, that, numerous, measures, had, been, taken, to, ensure, the, safety, of, passengers, and, sbs, transit, publicised, the, safety, precautions, on, the, driverless, north, east, line, before, and, after, its, opening, safety, campaign, posters, are, highly, visible, in, trains, and, stations, and, the, operators, frequently, broadcast, safety, announcements, to, passengers, and, to, commuters, waiting, for, trains, fire, safety, standards, are, consistent, and, equivalent, with, the, guidelines, of, the, national, fire, protection, association, in, the, united, states, full, height, platform, screen, doors, were, already, installed, in, underground, stations, since, 1987, supplied, by, westinghouse, there, were, calls, for, platform, screen, doors, to, be, installed, at, elevated, stations, after, several, incidents, in, which, passengers, were, killed, by, oncoming, trains, when, they, fell, onto, the, railway, tracks, at, elevated, stations, the, authorities, initially, rejected, such, calls, by, casting, doubts, over, functionality, and, concerns, about, the, high, installation, costs, nevertheless, the, lta, reversed, its, decision, and, made, plans, to, install, half, height, platform, screen, doors, in, all, elevated, stations, on, 25, january, 2008, the, first, platform, screen, doors, by, st, electronics, were, installed, at, jurong, east, pasir, ris, and, yishun, stations, in, 2009, under, trials, to, test, their, feasibility, by, 14, march, 2012, all, elevated, stations, have, been, retrofitted, with, the, doors, and, are, operational, these, doors, prevent, suicides, and, unauthorised, access, to, restricted, areas, under, the, rapid, transit, systems, act, acts, such, as, smoking, eating, or, drinking, in, stations, and, trains, the, misuse, of, emergency, equipment, and, trespassing, on, the, railway, tracks, are, illegal, with, penalties, ranging, from, fines, to, imprisonment, there, were, a, few, major, incidents, in, the, history, of, the, mrt, which, opened, in, 1987, on, 5, august, 1993, two, trains, collided, at, clementi, station, because, of, an, oil, spillage, on, the, track, which, resulted, in, 132, injuries, during, the, construction, of, the, circle, line, on, 20, april, 2004, a, tunnel, being, constructed, under, nicoll, highway, collapsed, and, led, to, the, deaths, of, four, workers, on, 15, november, 2017, two, trains, one, being, empty, collided, at, low, speed, at, joo, koon, station, due, to, a, malfunction, with, the, communications, based, train, control, cbtc, prior, to, the, 2020, circuit, breaker, measures, during, the, early, stages, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, the, public, transport, operators, and, lta, were, criticised, by, some, commuters, for, its, delayed, actions, of, crowd, control, and, the, enforcement, of, social, distancing, on, public, transport, in, response, the, lta, rolled, out, a, series, of, precautionary, measures, such, as, social, distancing, measures, and, making, the, wearing, of, masks, in, public, transport, mandatory, social, distancing, markers, were, progressively, implemented, in, the, mrt, trains, and, stations, which, commuters, must, adhere, to, enforced, by, auxiliary, officers, and, transport, ambassadors, the, significant, reduction, of, commuters, as, remote, work, increased, resulted, in, the, transport, operators, reducing, train, frequencies, and, closing, stations, earlier, from, 17, april, however, train, frequencies, were, shortly, reverted, to, normal, upon, review, and, feedback, from, the, public, since, june, 2020, the, mrt, system, has, resumed, pre, circuit, breaker, operations, regulations, for, social, distancing, on, public, transport, are, no, longer, applicable, by, law, social, distancing, stickers, on, seats, have, been, removed, mrt, lines, operate, from, 5, 30, am, to, 1, 00, am, daily, with, the, exception, of, selected, periods, such, as, new, year, s, eve, chinese, new, year, deepavali, hari, raya, christmas, eves, of, public, holidays, and, special, occasions, such, as, the, state, funeral, of, lee, kuan, yew, 2015, when, most, of, the, lines, stay, open, throughout, the, night, or, extended, till, later, before, the, covid, 19, pandemic, began, in, 2020, additionally, some, stretches, of, the, line, end, earlier, open, later, and, close, on, a, few, days, of, the, weekend, the, nightly, closures, are, used, for, maintenance, during, the, covid, 19, pandemic, across, the, country, train, services, ended, earlier, and, service, extensions, on, the, eves, of, public, holidays, ceased, from, 7, april, 2020, however, from, 1, june, train, services, were, reverted, to, the, usual, hours, from, 5, 30am, to, 12am, except, for, cny, eve, when, train, services, ended, 30, minutes, earlier, from, then, on, and, train, services, were, no, longer, extended, on, eves, of, public, holidays, early, stages, of, the, mrt, s, construction, paid, scant, attention, to, station, design, with, an, emphasis, on, functionality, over, aesthetics, this, is, particularly, evident, in, the, first, few, stages, of, the, north, south, and, east, west, lines, that, opened, between, 1987, and, 1988, from, yio, chu, kang, to, clementi, an, exception, to, this, was, orchard, chosen, by, its, designers, to, be, a, showpiece, of, the, system, and, built, initially, with, a, domed, roof, architectural, themes, became, more, important, only, in, subsequent, stages, and, resulted, in, such, designs, as, the, cylindrical, station, shapes, on, all, stations, between, kallang, and, pasir, ris, except, eunos, and, west, of, boon, lay, and, the, perched, roofs, at, boon, lay, lakeside, chinese, garden, bukit, batok, bukit, gombak, choa, chu, kang, khatib, yishun, and, eunos, stations, expo, station, located, on, the, changi, airport, branch, of, the, east, west, line, is, adjacent, to, the, 100, 000, square, metre, singapore, expo, exhibition, facility, designed, by, foster, and, partners, and, completed, in, january, 2001, the, station, features, a, large, pillarless, titanium, clad, roof, in, an, elliptical, shape, that, sheathes, the, length, of, the, station, platform, this, complements, a, smaller, 40, metre, reflective, stainless, steel, disc, overlapping, the, titanium, ellipse, and, visually, floats, over, a, glass, elevator, shaft, and, the, main, entrance, the, other, station, with, similar, architecture, is, dover, changi, airport, station, the, easternmost, station, on, the, mrt, network, has, the, widest, platform, in, any, underground, mrt, station, in, singapore, in, 2011, it, was, rated, 10, out, of, 15, most, beautiful, subway, stops, in, the, world, by, bootsnall, various, features, have, been, incorporated, into, the, design, to, make, the, station, aesthetically, pleasing, to, travellers, the, station, is, designed, by, architectural, firm, skidmore, owings, and, merrill, featuring, a, large, interior, space, and, an, illuminated, 150, metre, 490, ft, link, bridge, spanning, over, the, island, platform, two, circle, line, stations, bras, basah, and, stadium, were, commissioned, through, the, marina, line, architectural, design, competition, which, was, jointly, organised, by, the, land, transport, authority, and, the, singapore, institute, of, architects, the, competition, did, not, require, any, prior, architectural, experience, from, competitors, and, is, acknowledged, by, the, industry, as, one, of, the, most, impartial, competitions, held, in, singapore, to, date, the, winner, of, both, stations, was, woha, in, 2009, best, transport, building, was, awarded, to, the, designers, at, woha, architects, at, the, world, architecture, festival, for, their, design, of, bras, basah, station, many, mrt, stations, have, specially, commissioned, artworks, in, a, wide, variety, of, art, styles, and, mediums, including, sculptures, murals, and, mosaics, with, over, 300, art, pieces, across, 80, stations, it, is, singapore, s, largest, public, art, programme, in, the, early, stages, of, the, mrt, artworks, were, seldom, included, primarily, consisting, of, a, few, paintings, or, sculptures, representing, the, recent, past, of, singapore, mounted, in, major, stations, the, opening, of, the, woodlands, extension, introduced, bolder, pieces, of, artwork, such, as, a, 4, 000, kg, sculpture, in, woodlands, with, the, opening, of, the, north, east, line, in, 2003, a, series, of, artworks, under, a, programme, called, art, in, transit, were, commissioned, by, the, land, transport, authority, lta, created, by, 19, local, artists, and, integrated, into, the, stations, interior, architecture, these, works, aim, to, promote, the, appreciation, of, public, art, in, high, traffic, environments, the, artwork, for, each, station, is, designed, to, suit, the, station, s, identity, subsequently, all, stations, on, the, north, east, circle, and, downtown, lines, have, taken, part, in, this, programme, during, their, construction, with, additional, artworks, installed, at, stations, on, other, mrt, lines, this, table, lists, the, network, s, rolling, stock, 3, c951a, at, present, all, lines, run, with, fixed, length, trains, between, three, and, six, cars, with, the, thomson, east, coast, line, using, four, cars, since, the, system, s, conception, in, 1987, all, train, lines, have, been, powered, by, the, 750, volt, dc, third, rail, with, the, exception, of, the, north, east, line, which, is, powered, by, 1500, volt, dc, overhead, lines, the, north, south, and, east, west, lines, use, an, automatic, train, operation, system, similar, to, london, underground, s, central, line, the, first, 19, of, the, oldest, trains, 5, of, the, c151, 10, of, the, c651, 4, of, the, c751b, in, the, network, were, phased, out, between, june, 2020, and, october, 2022, older, trains, have, been, renewed, over, the, years, under, refurbishment, schemes, to, enhance, their, lifespan, as, well, as, to, adhere, to, updated, safety, and, usability, codes, refurbished, and, new, trains, have, improved, passenger, information, systems, such, as, the, smrt, active, route, map, information, system, more, grab, poles, wider, seats, more, space, near, the, doors, spaces, for, wheelchairs, and, cctv, cameras, as, a, trial, run, luggage, racks, were, installed, on, the, c751b, trains, to, serve, travellers, on, the, changi, airport, branch, line, the, scheme, was, withdrawn, in, july, 2003, and, the, luggage, racks, were, removed, all, trains, are, contracted, by, open, tender, with, their, contract, numbers, forming, the, most, recognised, name, of, the, stock, official, sources, occasionally, refer, to, the, trains, of, the, north, south, and, east, west, lines, as, numbered, generation, trains, with, the, c151, train, being, the, first, and, the, newest, r151, train, being, the, seventh, in, addition, to, aforementioned, passenger, electric, multiple, units, mrt, operators, also, have, their, own, engineering, rolling, stock, used, for, maintenance, purposes, these, include, plasser, theurer, tamping, machines, multi, function, vehicles, for, rail, inspection, speno, railgrinders, cranes, tunnel, cleaning, wagons, viaduct, inspection, wagons, ckg, diesel, locomotives, for, shunting, purposes, and, deli, diesel, locomotives, and, sch, ma, electric, locomotives, for, hauling, maintenance, trains, a, key, component, of, the, signalling, system, on, the, mrt, is, the, automatic, train, control, atc, system, which, in, turn, is, made, up, of, two, sub, systems, the, automatic, train, operation, ato, and, automatic, train, protection, atp, the, atc, has, trackside, and, trainborne, components, working, together, to, provide, safe,

operators, to, collect, fares, by, restricting, entry, only, through, the, fare, gates, also, known, as, access, control, gates, these, gates, connected, to, a, computer, network, can, read, and, update, electronic, tickets, capable, of, storing, data, and, can, store, information, such, as, the, initial, and, destination, stations, and, the, duration, for, each, trip, the, ticketing, system, currently, utilises, a, mixture, of, account, based, ticketing, abt, or, simplygo, and, legacy, non, abt, card, based, options, the, station, machines, allow, the, customer, to, buy, additional, value, for, stored, value, smartcards, such, smartcards, require, a, minimum, amount, of, stored, credit, as, the, fare, system, has, been, integrated, by, transitlink, commuters, need, to, pay, only, one, fare, and, pass, through, two, fare, gates, once, on, entry, once, on, exit, for, an, entire, journey, for, most, interchange, stations, even, when, transferring, between, lines, operated, by, different, companies, commuters, can, choose, to, extend, a, trip, mid, journey, and, pay, the, difference, when, they, exit, their, destination, station, because, the, rail, operators, are, government, assisted, profit, based, corporations, fares, on, the, mrt, system, are, pitched, to, at, least, break, even, level, the, operators, collect, these, fares, by, selling, electronic, data, storing, tickets, the, prices, of, which, are, calculated, based, on, the, distance, between, the, start, and, destination, stations, these, prices, increase, in, fixed, stages, for, standard, non, discounted, travel, fares, are, calculated, in, increments, based, on, approximate, distances, between, stations, in, contrast, to, the, use, of, fare, zones, in, other, subway, systems, such, as, the, london, underground, although, operated, by, private, companies, the, system, s, fare, structure, is, regulated, by, the, public, transport, council, ptc, to, which, the, operators, submit, requests, for, changes, in, fares, fares, are, kept, affordable, by, pegging, them, approximately, to, distance, related, bus, fares, thus, encouraging, commuters, to, use, the, network, and, reduce, heavy, reliance, on, the, bus, system, fare, increases, have, caused, public, concern, historically, fares, on, the, fully, underground, north, east, circle, and, downtown, lines, had, been, higher, than, those, of, the, north, south, and, east, west, lines, nsewl, a, disparity, that, was, justified, by, citing, higher, costs, of, operation, and, maintenance, on, a, completely, underground, line, however, the, public, transport, council, ptc, announced, in, 2016, that, fares, for, the, three, underground, lines, would, be, reduced, to, match, those, on, the, nsewl, which, took, effect, along, with, the, yearly, applied, fare, changes, on, 30, december, 2016, after, the, opening, of, downtown, line, stage, 3, transport, minister, khaw, boon, wan, announced, that, public, transport, fare, rules, will, be, reviewed, to, allow, for, transfers, across, mrt, lines, at, different, stations, due, to, the, increasing, density, of, the, rail, network, at, the, time, commuters, were, charged, a, second, time, when, they, made, such, transfers, he, added, that, the, ptc, would, review, distance, based, fare, transfer, rules, to, ensure, they, continue, to, facilitate, fast, seamless, public, transport, journeys, the, review, of, distance, based, fare, rules, on, mrt, lines, was, completed, and, a, waiver, on, the, second, boarding, fee, incurred, when, making, such, transfers, was, announced, on, 22, march, 2018, the, scheme, was, implemented, on, 29, december, of, the, same, year, the, simplygo, abt, system, accepts, bank, cards, mobile, wallets, and, proprietary, cards,

not, experience, any, major, performance, issues, during, its, first, quarter, century, of, operations, however, there, were, occasional, disruptions, around, the, period, from, 2011, to, 2018, the, cause, of, which, was, often, attributed, to, the, system, aging, coupled, with, increased, ridership, due, to, population, growth, beginning, with, the, train, disruptions, in, 2011, this, incident, led, to, a, committee, of, inquiry, which, uncovered, serious, shortcomings, in, smrt, s, maintenance, regime, for, the, december, 2011, disruptions, the, land, transport, authority, imposed, a, maximum, penalty, of, s, 2, million, on, smrt, approximately, us, 1, 526, million, for, the, two, train, disruptions, along, the, north, south, line, on, 15, and, 17, december, 2011, a, committee, of, inquiry, discovered, shortcomings, in, the, maintenance, regime, and, checks, prompting, then, ceo, saw, phaik, hwa, to, resign, a, much, larger, power, related, incident, than, the, december, 2011, event, occurred, on, 7, july, 2015, when, train, services, on, both, the, north, south, and, east, west, lines, were, shut, down, in, both, directions, following, a, major, power, trip, the, disruption, lasted, for, more, than, 3, hours, affecting, 413, 000, commuters, this, was, considered, the, worst, disruption, to, the, mrt, network, since, it, first, began, operations, in, 1987, surpassing, the, december, 2011, event, independent, experts, from, sweden, and, japan, were, hired, to, conduct, investigation, into, the, cause, of, the, disruption, the, cause, was, identified, as, damage, to, a, third, rail, insulator, due, to, a, water, leak, at, tanjong, pagar, station, consequently, a, program, was, implemented, to, replace, insulators, liable, to, similar, failure, for, the, july, 2015, disruption, lta, imposed, a, higher, penalty, of, s, 5, 4, million, on, smrt, on, 22, march, 2016, a, fatal, accident, occurred, off, pasir, ris, station, two, of, smrt, s, track, maintenance, trainee, staff, were, lethally, run, over, by, an, approaching, c151, at, a, signalling, box, of, the, station, they, were, part, of, a, technical, team, of, 15, staff, led, by, a, supervisor, and, were, asked, to, go, down, to, the, tracks, to, investigate, an, alarm, triggered, by, a, possible, signalling, equipment, fault, the, operator, said, the, team, had, permission, to, access, the, tracks, but, did, not, coordinate, with, a, signal, unit, in, the, station, control, to, ensure, train, captains, in, the, area, where, the, team, was, exercised, caution, while, pulling, into, pasir, ris, station, this, incident, resulted, in, a, 2, 5, hour, service, delay, between, tanah, merah, and, pasir, ris, stations, affecting, at, least, 10, 000, commuters, on, 7, october, 2017, a, dilapidated, float, and, pump, system, at, bishan, station, caused, a, tunnel, flood, after, heavy, torrential, rainstorms, it, was, the, worst, train, disruption, since, 2011, and, was, the, first, ever, flooding, incident, in, the, history, of, the, mrt, this, resulted, in, criticism, on, the, public, transport, operators, among, singaporeans, once, again, and, a, huge, debate, about, the, high, rankings, that, manage, the, system, with, calls, being, made, for, the, resignation, of, then, transport, minister, khaw, boon, wan, urban, transport, expert, park, byung, joon, from, the, singapore, university, of, social, sciences, added, that, the, negligence, displayed, by, smrt, in, this, regard, was, tantamount, to, a, criminal, offence, and, after, an, internal, investigation, found, that, the, maintenance, crew, of, the, bishan, station, s, pump, system, had, submitted, maintenance, records, for, nearly, a, year, without, actually, carrying, out, the, works, the, december, 2011, disruptions, brought, the, state, of, public, transportation, as, a, whole, to, national, prominence, among, singaporeans, who, had, previously, considered, the, system, to, be, reliable, and, robust, since, its, inception, in, 1987, lta, also, noted, a, marked, increase, in, dissatisfaction, with, public, transport, with, the, release, of, the, 2012, public, transport, customer, satisfaction, survey, and, promised, government, action, to, deal, with, issues, relating, to, system, disruptions, the, government, reviewed, the, penalties, for, train, disruptions, and, made, free, travel, available, for, all, bus, services, passing, mrt, stations, affected, during, any, train, disruptions, exits, were, also, made, free, in, addition, to, increase, satisfaction, with, public,
