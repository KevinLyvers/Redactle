a, microscope, from, ancient, greek, mikr, s, small, and, skop, to, look, at, examine, inspect, is, a, laboratory, instrument, used, to, examine, objects, that, are, too, small, to, be, seen, by, the, naked, eye, microscopy, is, the, science, of, investigating, small, objects, and, structures, using, a, microscope, microscopic, means, being, invisible, to, the, eye, unless, aided, by, a, microscope, there, are, many, types, of, microscopes, and, they, may, be, grouped, in, different, ways, one, way, is, to, describe, the, method, an, instrument, uses, to, interact, with, a, sample, and, produce, images, either, by, sending, a, beam, of, light, or, electrons, through, a, sample, in, its, optical, path, by, detecting, photon, emissions, from, a, sample, or, by, scanning, across, and, a, short, distance, from, the, surface, of, a, sample, using, a, probe, the, most, common, microscope, and, the, first, to, be, invented, is, the, optical, microscope, which, uses, lenses, to, refract, visible, light, that, passed, through, a, thinly, sectioned, sample, to, produce, an, observable, image, other, major, types, of, microscopes, are, the, fluorescence, microscope, electron, microscope, both, the, transmission, electron, microscope, and, the, scanning, electron, microscope, and, various, types, of, scanning, probe, microscopes, although, objects, resembling, lenses, date, back, 4, 000, years, and, there, are, greek, accounts, of, the, optical, properties, of, water, filled, spheres, 5th, century, bc, followed, by, many, centuries, of, writings, on, optics, the, earliest, known, use, of, simple, microscopes, magnifying, glasses, dates, back, to, the, widespread, use, of, lenses, in, eyeglasses, in, the, 13th, century, the, earliest, known, examples, of, compound, microscopes, which, combine, an, objective, lens, near, the, specimen, with, an, eyepiece, to, view, a, real, image, appeared, in, europe, around, 1620, the, inventor, is, unknown, even, though, many, claims, have, been, made, over, the, years, several, revolve, around, the, spectacle, making, centers, in, the, netherlands, including, claims, it, was, invented, in, 1590, by, zacharias, janssen, claim, made, by, his, son, or, zacharias, father, hans, martens, or, both, claims, it, was, invented, by, their, neighbor, and, rival, spectacle, maker, hans, lippershey, who, applied, for, the, first, telescope, patent, in, 1608, and, claims, it, was, invented, by, expatriate, cornelis, drebbel, who, was, noted, to, have, a, version, in, london, in, 1619, galileo, galilei, also, sometimes, cited, as, compound, microscope, inventor, seems, to, have, found, after, 1610, that, he, could, close, focus, his, telescope, to, view, small, objects, and, after, seeing, a, compound, microscope, built, by, drebbel, exhibited, in, rome, in, 1624, built, his, own, improved, version, giovanni, faber, coined, the, name, microscope, for, the, compound, microscope, galileo, submitted, to, the, accademia, dei, lincei, in, 1625, galileo, had, called, it, the, occhiolino, little, eye, ren, descartes, dioptrique, 1637, describes, microscopes, wherein, a, concave, mirror, with, its, concavity, towards, the, object, is, used, in, conjunction, with, a, lens, for, illuminating, the, object, which, is, mounted, on, a, point, fixing, it, at, the, focus, of, the, mirror, the, first, detailed, account, of, the, microscopic, anatomy, of, organic, tissue, based, on, the, use, of, a, microscope, did, not, appear, until, 1644, in, giambattista, odierna, s, l, occhio, della, mosca, or, the, fly, s, eye, the, microscope, was, still, largely, a, novelty, until, the, 1660s, and, 1670s, when, naturalists, in, italy, the, netherlands, and, england, began, using, them, to, study, biology, italian, scientist, marcello, malpighi, called, the, father, of, histology, by, some, historians, of, biology, began, his, analysis, of, biological, structures, with, the, lungs, the, publication, in, 1665, of, robert, hooke, s, micrographia, had, a, huge, impact, largely, because, of, its, impressive, illustrations, hooke, created, tiny, lenses, of, small, glass, globules, made, by, fusing, the, ends, of, threads, of, spun, glass, a, significant, contribution, came, from, antonie, van, leeuwenhoek, who, achieved, up, to, 300, times, magnification, using, a, simple, single, lens, microscope, he, sandwiched, a, very, small, glass, ball, lens, between, the, holes, in, two, metal, plates, riveted, together, and, with, an, adjustable, by, screws, needle, attached, to, mount, the, specimen, then, van, leeuwenhoek, re, discovered, red, blood, cells, after, jan, swammerdam, and, spermatozoa, and, helped, popularise, the, use, of, microscopes, to, view, biological, ultrastructure, on, 9, october, 1676, van, leeuwenhoek, reported, the, discovery, of, micro, organisms, the, performance, of, a, compound, light, microscope, depends, on, the, quality, and, correct, use, of, the, condensor, lens, system, to, focus, light, on, the, specimen, and, the, objective, lens, to, capture, the, light, from, the, specimen, and, form, an, image, early, instruments, were, limited, until, this, principle, was, fully, appreciated, and, developed, from, the, late, 19th, to, very, early, 20th, century, and, until, electric, lamps, were, available, as, light, sources, in, 1893, august, k, hler, developed, a, key, principle, of, sample, illumination, k, hler, illumination, which, is, central, to, achieving, the, theoretical, limits, of, resolution, for, the, light, microscope, this, method, of, sample, illumination, produces, even, lighting, and, overcomes, the, limited, contrast, and, resolution, imposed, by, early, techniques, of, sample, illumination, further, developments, in, sample, illumination, came, from, the, discovery, of, phase, contrast, by, frits, zernike, in, 1953, and, differential, interference, contrast, illumination, by, georges, nomarski, in, 1955, both, of, which, allow, imaging, of, unstained, transparent, samples, in, the, early, 20th, century, a, significant, alternative, to, the, light, microscope, was, developed, an, instrument, that, uses, a, beam, of, electrons, rather, than, light, to, generate, an, image, the, german, physicist, ernst, ruska, working, with, electrical, engineer, max, knoll, developed, the, first, prototype, electron, microscope, in, 1931, a, transmission, electron, microscope, tem, the, transmission, electron, microscope, works, on, similar, principles, to, an, optical, microscope, but, uses, electrons, in, the, place, of, light, and, electromagnets, in, the, place, of, glass, lenses, use, of, electrons, instead, of, light, allows, for, much, higher, resolution, development, of, the, transmission, electron, microscope, was, quickly, followed, in, 1935, by, the, development, of, the, scanning, electron, microscope, by, max, knoll, although, tems, were, being, used, for, research, before, wwii, and, became, popular, afterwards, the, sem, was, not, commercially, available, until, 1965, transmission, electron, microscopes, became, popular, following, the, second, world, war, ernst, ruska, working, at, siemens, developed, the, first, commercial, transmission, electron, microscope, and, in, the, 1950s, major, scientific, conferences, on, electron, microscopy, started, being, held, in, 1965, the, first, commercial, scanning, electron, microscope, was, developed, by, professor, sir, charles, oatley, and, his, postgraduate, student, gary, stewart, and, marketed, by, the, cambridge, instrument, company, as, the, stereoscan, one, of, the, latest, discoveries, made, about, using, an, electron, microscope, is, the, ability, to, identify, a, virus, since, this, microscope, produces, a, visible, clear, image, of, small, organelles, in, an, electron, microscope, there, is, no, need, for, reagents, to, see, the, virus, or, harmful, cells, resulting, in, a, more, efficient, way, to, detect, pathogens, from, 1981, to, 1983, gerd, binnig, and, heinrich, rohrer, worked, at, ibm, in, z, rich, switzerland, to, study, the, quantum, tunnelling, phenomenon, they, created, a, practical, instrument, a, scanning, probe, microscope, from, quantum, tunnelling, theory, that, read, very, small, forces, exchanged, between, a, probe, and, the, surface, of, a, sample, the, probe, approaches, the, surface, so, closely, that, electrons, can, flow, continuously, between, probe, and, sample, making, a, current, from, surface, to, probe, the, microscope, was, not, initially, well, received, due, to, the, complex, nature, of, the, underlying, theoretical, explanations, in, 1984, jerry, tersoff, and, d, r, hamann, while, at, at, t, s, bell, laboratories, in, murray, hill, new, jersey, began, publishing, articles, that, tied, theory, to, the, experimental, results, obtained, by, the, instrument, this, was, closely, followed, in, 1985, with, functioning, commercial, instruments, and, in, 1986, with, gerd, binnig, quate, and, gerber, s, invention, of, the, atomic, force, microscope, then, binnig, s, and, rohrer, s, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, the, spm, new, types, of, scanning, probe, microscope, have, continued, to, be, developed, as, the, ability, to, machine, ultra, fine, probes, and, tips, has, advanced, the, most, recent, developments, in, light, microscope, largely, centre, on, the, rise, of, fluorescence, microscopy, in, biology, during, the, last, decades, of, the, 20th, century, particularly, in, the, post, genomic, era, many, techniques, for, fluorescent, staining, of, cellular, structures, were, developed, the, main, groups, of, techniques, involve, targeted, chemical, staining, of, particular, cell, structures, for, example, the, chemical, compound, dapi, to, label, dna, use, of, antibodies, conjugated, to, fluorescent, reporters, see, immunofluorescence, and, fluorescent, proteins, such, as, green, fluorescent, protein, these, techniques, use, these, different, fluorophores, for, analysis, of, cell, structure, at, a, molecular, level, in, both, live, and, fixed, samples, the, rise, of, fluorescence, microscopy, drove, the, development, of, a, major, modern, microscope, design, the, confocal, microscope, the, principle, was, patented, in, 1957, by, marvin, minsky, although, laser, technology, limited, practical, application, of, the, technique, it, was, not, until, 1978, when, thomas, and, christoph, cremer, developed, the, first, practical, confocal, laser, scanning, microscope, and, the, technique, rapidly, gained, popularity, through, the, 1980s, much, current, research, in, the, early, 21st, century, on, optical, microscope, techniques, is, focused, on, development, of, superresolution, analysis, of, fluorescently, labelled, samples, structured, illumination, can, improve, resolution, by, around, two, to, four, times, and, techniques, like, stimulated, emission, depletion, sted, microscopy, are, approaching, the, resolution, of, electron, microscopes, this, occurs, because, the, diffraction, limit, is, occurred, from, light, or, excitation, which, makes, the, resolution, must, be, doubled, to, become, super, saturated, stefan, hell, was, awarded, the, 2014, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, the, development, of, the, sted, technique, along, with, eric, betzig, and, william, moerner, who, adapted, fluorescence, microscopy, for, single, molecule, visualization, x, ray, microscopes, are, instruments, that, use, electromagnetic, radiation, usually, in, the, soft, x, ray, band, to, image, objects, technological, advances, in, x, ray, lens, optics, in, the, early, 1970s, made, the, instrument, a, viable, imaging, choice, they, are, often, used, in, tomography, see, micro, computed, tomography, to, produce, three, dimensional, images, of, objects, including, biological, materials, that, have, not, been, chemically, fixed, currently, research, is, being, done, to, improve, optics, for, hard, x, rays, which, have, greater, penetrating, power, microscopes, can, be, separated, into, several, different, classes, one, grouping, is, based, on, what, interacts, with, the, sample, to, generate, the, image, i, e, light, or, photons, optical, microscopes, electrons, electron, microscopes, or, a, probe, scanning, probe, microscopes, alternatively, microscopes, can, be, classified, based, on, whether, they, analyze, the, sample, via, a, scanning, point, confocal, optical, microscopes, scanning, electron, microscopes, and, scanning, probe, microscopes, or, analyze, the, sample, all, at, once, wide, field, optical, microscopes, and, transmission, electron, microscopes, wide, field, optical, microscopes, and, transmission, electron, microscopes, both, use, the, theory, of, lenses, optics, for, light, microscopes, and, electromagnet, lenses, for, electron, microscopes, in, order, to, magnify, the, image, generated, by, the, passage, of, a, wave, transmitted, through, the, sample, or, reflected, by, the, sample, the, waves, used, are, electromagnetic, in, optical, microscopes, or, electron, beams, in, electron, microscopes, resolution, in, these, microscopes, is, limited, by, the, wavelength, of, the, radiation, used, to, image, the, sample, where, shorter, wavelengths, allow, for, a, higher, resolution, scanning, optical, and, electron, microscopes, like, the, confocal, microscope, and, scanning, electron, microscope, use, lenses, to, focus, a, spot, of, light, or, electrons, onto, the, sample, then, analyze, the, signals, generated, by, the, beam, interacting, with, the, sample, the, point, is, then, scanned, over, the, sample, to, analyze, a, rectangular, region, magnification, of, the, image, is, achieved, by, displaying, the, data, from, scanning, a, physically, small, sample, area, on, a, relatively, large, screen, these, microscopes, have, the, same, resolution, limit, as, wide, field, optical, probe, and, electron, microscopes, scanning, probe, microscopes, also, analyze, a, single, point, in, the, sample, and, then, scan, the, probe, over, a, rectangular, sample, region, to, build, up, an, image, as, these, microscopes, do, not, use, electromagnetic, or, electron, radiation, for, imaging, they, are, not, subject, to, the, same, resolution, limit, as, the, optical, and, electron, microscopes, described, above, the, most, common, type, of, microscope, and, the, first, invented, is, the, optical, microscope, this, is, an, optical, instrument, containing, one, or, more, lenses, producing, an, enlarged, image, of, a, sample, placed, in, the, focal, plane, optical, microscopes, have, refractive, glass, occasionally, plastic, or, quartz, to, focus, light, on, the, eye, or, on, to, another, light, detector, mirror, based, optical, microscopes, operate, in, the, same, manner, typical, magnification, of, a, light, microscope, assuming, visible, range, light, is, up, to, 1, 250, with, a, theoretical, resolution, limit, of, around, 0, 250, micrometres, or, 250, nanometres, this, limits, practical, magnification, to, 1, 500, specialized, techniques, e, g, scanning, confocal, microscopy, vertico, smi, may, exceed, this, magnification, but, the, resolution, is, diffraction, limited, the, use, of, shorter, wavelengths, of, light, such, as, ultraviolet, is, one, way, to, improve, the, spatial, resolution, of, the, optical, microscope, as, are, devices, such, as, the, near, field, scanning, optical, microscope, sarfus, is, a, recent, optical, technique, that, increases, the, sensitivity, of, a, standard, optical, microscope, to, a, point, where, it, is, possible, to, directly, visualize, nanometric, films, down, to, 0, 3, nanometre, and, isolated, nano, objects, down, to, 2, nm, diameter, the, technique, is, based, on, the, use, of, non, reflecting, substrates, for, cross, polarized, reflected, light, microscopy, ultraviolet, light, enables, the, resolution, of, microscopic, features, as, well, as, the, imaging, of, samples, that, are, transparent, to, the, eye, near, infrared, light, can, be, used, to, visualize, circuitry, embedded, in, bonded, silicon, devices, since, silicon, is, transparent, in, this, region, of, wavelengths, in, fluorescence, microscopy, many, wavelengths, of, light, ranging, from, the, ultraviolet, to, the, visible, can, be, used, to, cause, samples, to, fluoresce, which, allows, viewing, by, eye, or, with, specifically, sensitive, cameras, phase, contrast, microscopy, is, an, optical, microscopic, illumination, technique, in, which, small, phase, shifts, in, the, light, passing, through, a, transparent, specimen, are, converted, into, amplitude, or, contrast, changes, in, the, image, the, use, of, phase, contrast, does, not, require, staining, to, view, the, slide, this, microscope, technique, made, it, possible, to, study, the, cell, cycle, in, live, cells, the, traditional, optical, microscope, has, more, recently, evolved, into, the, digital, microscope, in, addition, to, or, instead, of, directly, viewing, the, object, through, the, eyepieces, a, type, of, sensor, similar, to, those, used, in, a, digital, camera, is, used, to, obtain, an, image, which, is, then, displayed, on, a, computer, monitor, these, sensors, may, use, cmos, or, charge, coupled, device, ccd, technology, depending, on, the, application, digital, microscopy, with, very, low, light, levels, to, avoid, damage, to, vulnerable, biological, samples, is, available, using, sensitive, photon, counting, digital, cameras, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, a, light, source, providing, pairs, of, entangled, photons, may, minimize, the, risk, of, damage, to, the, most, light, sensitive, samples, in, this, application, of, ghost, imaging, to, photon, sparse, microscopy, the, sample, is, illuminated, with, infrared, photons, each, of, which, is, spatially, correlated, with, an, entangled, partner, in, the, visible, band, for, efficient, imaging, by, a, photon, counting, camera, the, two, major, types, of, electron, microscopes, are, transmission, electron, microscopes, tems, and, scanning, electron, microscopes, sems, they, both, have, series, of, electromagnetic, and, electrostatic, lenses, to, focus, a, high, energy, beam, of, electrons, on, a, sample, in, a, tem, the, electrons, pass, through, the, sample, analogous, to, basic, optical, microscopy, this, requires, careful, sample, preparation, since, electrons, are, scattered, strongly, by, most, materials, the, samples, must, also, be, very, thin, below, 100, nm, in, order, for, the, electrons, to, pass, through, it, cross, sections, of, cells, stained, with, osmium, and, heavy, metals, reveal, clear, organelle, membranes, and, proteins, such, as, ribosomes, with, a, 0, 1, nm, level, of, resolution, detailed, views, of, viruses, 20, 300, nm, and, a, strand, of, dna, 2, nm, in, width, can, be, obtained, in, contrast, the, sem, has, raster, coils, to, scan, the, surface, of, bulk, objects, with, a, fine, electron, beam, therefore, the, specimen, do, not, necessarily, need, to, be, sectioned, but, coating, with, a, nanometric, metal, or, carbon, layer, may, be, needed, for, nonconductive, samples, sem, allows, fast, surface, imaging, of, samples, possibly, in, thin, water, vapor, to, prevent, drying, the, different, types, of, scanning, probe, microscopes, arise, from, the, many, different, types, of, interactions, that, occur, when, a, small, probe, is, scanned, over, and, interacts, with, a, specimen, these, interactions, or, modes, can, be, recorded, or, mapped, as, function, of, location, on, the, surface, to, form, a, characterization, map, the, three, most, common, types, of, scanning, probe, microscopes, are, atomic, force, microscopes, afm, near, field, scanning, optical, microscopes, nsom, or, snom, scanning, near, field, optical, microscopy, and, scanning, tunneling, microscopes, stm, an, atomic, force, microscope, has, a, fine, probe, usually, of, silicon, or, silicon, nitride, attached, to, a, cantilever, the, probe, is, scanned, over, the, surface, of, the, sample, and, the, forces, that, cause, an, interaction, between, the, probe, and, the, surface, of, the, sample, are, measured, and, mapped, a, near, field, scanning, optical, microscope, is, similar, to, an, afm, but, its, probe, consists, of, a, light, source, in, an, optical, fiber, covered, with, a, tip, that, has, usually, an, aperture, for, the, light, to, pass, through, the, microscope, can, capture, either, transmitted, or, reflected, light, to, measure, very, localized, optical, properties, of, the, surface, commonly, of, a, biological, specimen, scanning, tunneling, microscopes, have, a, metal, tip, with, a, single, apical, atom, the, tip, is, attached, to, a, tube, through, which, a, current, flows, the, tip, is, scanned, over, the, surface, of, a, conductive, sample, until, a, tunneling, current, flows, the, current, is, kept, constant, by, computer, movement, of, the, tip, and, an, image, is, formed, by, the, recorded, movements, of, the, tip, scanning, acoustic, microscopes, use, sound, waves, to, measure, variations, in, acoustic, impedance, similar, to, sonar, in, principle, they, are, used, for, such, jobs, as, detecting, defects, in, the, subsurfaces, of, materials, including, those, found, in, integrated, circuits, on, february, 4, 2013, australian, engineers, built, a, quantum, microscope, which, provides, unparalleled, precision, mobile, app, microscopes, can, optionally, be, used, as, optical, microscope, when, the, flashlight, is, activated, however, mobile, app, microscopes, are, harder, to, use, due, to, visual, noise, are, often, limited, to, 40x, and, the, resolution, limits, of, the, camera, lens, itself
