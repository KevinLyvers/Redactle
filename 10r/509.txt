a, knife, pl, knives, from, old, norse, knifr, knife, dirk, is, a, tool, or, weapon, with, a, cutting, edge, or, blade, usually, attached, to, a, handle, or, hilt, one, of, the, earliest, tools, used, by, humanity, knives, appeared, at, least, 2, 5, million, years, ago, as, evidenced, by, the, oldowan, tools, originally, made, of, wood, bone, and, stone, such, as, flint, and, obsidian, over, the, centuries, in, step, with, improvements, in, both, metallurgy, and, manufacturing, knife, blades, have, been, made, from, copper, bronze, iron, steel, ceramic, and, titanium, most, modern, knives, have, either, fixed, or, folding, blades, blade, patterns, and, styles, vary, by, maker, and, country, of, origin, knives, can, serve, various, purposes, hunters, use, a, hunting, knife, soldiers, use, the, combat, knife, scouts, campers, and, hikers, carry, a, pocketknife, there, are, kitchen, knives, for, preparing, foods, the, chef, s, knife, the, paring, knife, bread, knife, cleaver, table, knife, butter, knives, and, steak, knives, weapons, daggers, or, switchblades, knives, for, throwing, or, juggling, and, knives, for, religious, ceremony, or, display, the, kirpan, a, modern, knife, consists, of, the, blade, edge, can, be, plain, or, serrated, or, a, combination, of, both, single, edged, knives, may, have, a, reverse, edge, or, false, edge, occupying, a, section, of, the, spine, these, edges, are, usually, serrated, and, are, used, to, further, enhance, function, the, handle, used, to, grip, and, manipulate, the, blade, safely, may, include, a, tang, a, portion, of, the, blade, that, extends, into, the, handle, knives, are, made, with, partial, tangs, extending, part, way, into, the, handle, known, as, stick, tangs, or, full, tangs, extending, the, full, length, of, the, handle, often, visible, on, top, and, bottom, there, is, also, the, enter, ado, construction, method, present, in, antique, knives, from, brazil, such, as, the, sorocaban, knife, which, consists, in, riveting, a, repurposed, blade, to, the, ricasso, of, a, bladeless, handle, the, handle, may, include, a, bolster, a, piece, of, heavy, material, usually, metal, situated, at, the, front, or, rear, of, the, handle, the, bolster, as, its, name, suggests, is, used, to, mechanically, strengthen, the, knife, knife, blades, can, be, manufactured, from, a, variety, of, materials, each, of, which, has, advantages, and, disadvantages, carbon, steel, an, alloy, of, iron, and, carbon, can, be, very, sharp, it, holds, its, edge, well, and, remains, easy, to, sharpen, but, is, vulnerable, to, rust, and, stains, stainless, steel, is, an, alloy, of, iron, chromium, possibly, nickel, and, molybdenum, with, only, a, small, amount, of, carbon, it, is, not, able, to, take, quite, as, sharp, an, edge, as, carbon, steel, but, is, highly, resistant, to, corrosion, high, carbon, stainless, steel, is, stainless, steel, with, a, higher, amount, of, carbon, intended, to, incorporate, the, better, attributes, of, carbon, steel, and, stainless, steel, high, carbon, stainless, steel, blades, do, not, discolor, or, stain, and, maintain, a, sharp, edge, laminated, blades, use, multiple, metals, to, create, a, layered, structure, combining, the, attributes, of, both, for, example, a, harder, more, brittle, steel, may, be, pressed, between, an, outer, layer, of, softer, tougher, stainless, steel, to, reduce, vulnerability, to, corrosion, in, this, case, however, the, part, most, affected, by, corrosion, the, edge, is, still, vulnerable, damascus, steel, is, a, form, of, pattern, welding, with, similarities, to, laminate, construction, layers, of, different, steel, types, are, welded, together, but, then, the, stock, is, manipulated, to, create, patterns, in, the, steel, titanium, is, a, metal, that, has, a, better, strength, to, weight, ratio, is, more, wear, resistant, and, more, flexible, than, steel, although, less, hard, and, unable, to, take, as, sharp, an, edge, carbides, in, the, titanium, alloy, allow, them, to, be, heat, treated, to, a, sufficient, hardness, ceramic, blades, are, hard, brittle, lightweight, and, do, not, corrode, they, may, maintain, a, sharp, edge, for, years, with, no, maintenance, at, all, but, are, fragile, and, will, break, if, dropped, on, a, hard, surface, or, twisted, in, use, they, can, only, be, sharpened, on, silicon, carbide, sandpaper, and, appropriate, grinding, wheels, plastic, blades, are, not, sharp, and, are, usually, serrated, to, enable, them, to, cut, they, are, often, disposable, steel, blades, are, commonly, shaped, by, forging, or, stock, removal, forged, blades, are, made, by, heating, a, single, piece, of, steel, then, shaping, the, metal, while, hot, using, a, hammer, or, press, stock, removal, blades, are, shaped, by, grinding, and, removing, metal, with, both, methods, after, shaping, the, steel, must, be, heat, treated, this, involves, heating, the, steel, above, its, critical, point, then, quenching, the, blade, to, harden, it, after, hardening, the, blade, is, tempered, to, remove, stresses, and, make, the, blade, tougher, mass, manufactured, kitchen, cutlery, uses, both, the, forging, and, stock, removal, processes, forging, tends, to, be, reserved, for, manufacturers, more, expensive, product, lines, and, can, often, be, distinguished, from, stock, removal, product, lines, by, the, presence, of, an, integral, bolster, though, integral, bolsters, can, be, crafted, through, either, shaping, method, knives, are, sharpened, in, various, ways, flat, ground, blades, have, a, profile, that, tapers, from, the, thick, spine, to, the, sharp, edge, in, a, straight, or, convex, line, seen, in, cross, section, the, blade, would, form, a, long, thin, triangle, or, where, the, taper, does, not, extend, to, the, back, of, the, blade, a, long, thin, rectangle, with, one, peaked, side, hollow, ground, blades, have, concave, beveled, edges, the, resulting, blade, has, a, thinner, edge, so, it, may, have, better, cutting, ability, for, shallow, cuts, but, it, is, lighter, and, less, durable, than, flat, ground, blades, and, will, tend, to, bind, in, deep, cuts, serrated, blade, knives, have, a, wavy, scalloped, or, saw, like, blade, serrated, blades, are, more, well, suited, for, tasks, that, require, aggressive, sawing, motions, whereas, plain, edge, blades, are, better, suited, for, tasks, that, require, push, through, cuts, e, g, shaving, chopping, slicing, many, knives, have, holes, in, the, blade, for, various, uses, holes, are, commonly, drilled, in, blades, to, reduce, friction, while, cutting, increase, single, handed, usability, of, pocket, knives, and, for, butchers, knives, allow, hanging, out, of, the, way, when, not, in, use, a, fixed, blade, knife, sometimes, called, a, sheath, knife, does, not, fold, or, slide, and, is, typically, stronger, due, to, the, tang, the, extension, of, the, blade, into, the, handle, and, lack, of, moving, parts, a, folding, knife, connects, the, blade, to, the, handle, through, a, pivot, allowing, the, blade, to, fold, into, the, handle, to, prevent, injury, to, the, knife, user, through, the, blade, accidentally, closing, on, the, user, s, hand, folding, knives, typically, have, a, locking, mechanism, different, locking, mechanisms, are, favored, by, various, individuals, for, reasons, such, as, perceived, strength, lock, safety, legality, and, ease, of, use, popular, locking, mechanisms, include, another, prominent, feature, of, many, folding, knives, is, the, opening, mechanism, traditional, pocket, knives, and, swiss, army, knives, commonly, employ, the, nail, nick, while, modern, folding, knives, more, often, use, a, stud, hole, disk, or, flipper, located, on, the, blade, all, of, which, have, the, benefit, of, allowing, the, user, to, open, the, knife, with, one, hand, the, wave, feature, is, another, prominent, design, which, uses, a, part, of, the, blade, that, protrudes, outward, to, catch, on, one, s, pocket, as, it, is, drawn, thus, opening, the, blade, this, was, patented, by, ernest, emerson, and, is, not, only, used, on, many, of, the, emerson, knives, but, also, on, knives, produced, by, several, other, manufacturers, notably, spyderco, and, cold, steel, automatic, or, switchblade, knives, open, using, the, stored, energy, from, a, spring, that, is, released, when, the, user, presses, a, button, or, lever, or, other, actuator, built, into, the, handle, of, the, knife, automatic, knives, are, severely, restricted, by, law, in, the, uk, and, most, american, states, increasingly, common, are, assisted, opening, knives, which, use, springs, to, propel, the, blade, once, the, user, has, moved, it, past, a, certain, angle, these, differ, from, automatic, or, switchblade, knives, in, that, the, blade, is, not, released, by, means, of, a, button, or, catch, on, the, handle, rather, the, blade, itself, is, the, actuator, most, assisted, openers, use, flippers, as, their, opening, mechanism, assisted, opening, knives, can, be, as, fast, or, faster, than, automatic, knives, to, deploy, in, the, lock, back, as, in, many, folding, knives, a, stop, pin, acting, on, the, top, or, behind, the, blade, prevents, it, from, rotating, clockwise, a, hook, on, the, tang, of, the, blade, engages, with, a, hook, on, the, rocker, bar, which, prevents, the, blade, from, rotating, counter, clockwise, the, rocker, bar, is, held, in, position, by, a, torsion, bar, to, release, the, knife, the, rocker, bar, is, pushed, downwards, as, indicated, and, pivots, around, the, rocker, pin, lifting, the, hook, and, freeing, the, blade, when, negative, pressure, pushing, down, on, the, spine, is, applied, to, the, blade, all, the, stress, is, transferred, from, the, hook, on, the, blade, s, tang, to, the, hook, on, the, rocker, bar, and, thence, to, the, small, rocker, pin, excessive, stress, can, shear, one, or, both, of, these, hooks, rendering, the, knife, effectively, useless, knife, company, cold, steel, uses, a, variant, of, the, lock, back, called, the, tri, ad, lock, which, introduces, a, pin, in, front, of, the, rocker, bar, to, relieve, stress, on, the, rocker, pin, has, an, elongated, hole, around, the, rocker, pin, to, allow, the, mechanism, to, wear, over, time, without, losing, strength, and, angles, the, hooks, so, that, the, faces, no, longer, meet, vertically, the, bolt, in, the, bolt, lock, is, a, rectangle, of, metal, that, is, constrained, to, slide, only, back, and, forward, when, the, knife, is, open, a, spring, biases, the, bolt, to, the, forward, position, where, it, rests, above, the, tang, of, the, blade, preventing, the, blade, from, closing, small, knobs, extend, through, the, handle, of, the, knife, on, both, sides, allowing, the, user, to, slide, the, bolt, backward, freeing, the, knife, to, close, the, axis, lock, used, by, knife, maker, benchmade, is, functionally, identical, to, the, bolt, lock, except, that, it, uses, a, cylinder, rather, than, a, rectangle, to, trap, the, blade, the, arc, lock, by, knife, maker, sog, is, similar, to, the, axis, lock, except, the, cylinder, follows, a, curved, path, rather, than, a, straight, path, in, the, liner, lock, an, l, shaped, split, in, the, liner, allows, part, of, the, liner, to, move, sideways, from, its, resting, position, against, the, handle, to, the, centre, of, the, knife, where, it, rests, against, the, flat, end, of, the, tang, to, disengage, this, leaf, spring, is, pushed, so, it, again, rests, flush, against, the, handle, allowing, the, knife, to, rotate, a, frame, lock, is, functionally, identical, but, instead, of, using, a, thin, liner, inside, the, handle, material, uses, a, thicker, piece, of, metal, as, the, handle, and, the, same, split, in, it, allows, a, section, of, the, frame, to, press, against, the, tang, a, sliding, knife, is, a, knife, that, can, be, opened, by, sliding, the, knife, blade, out, the, front, of, the, handle, one, method, of, opening, is, where, the, blade, exits, out, the, front, of, the, handle, point, first, and, then, is, locked, into, place, an, example, of, this, is, the, gravity, knife, another, form, is, an, otf, out, the, front, switchblade, which, only, requires, the, push, of, a, button, or, spring, to, cause, the, blade, to, slide, out, of, the, handle, and, lock, into, place, to, retract, the, blade, back, into, the, handle, a, release, lever, or, button, usually, the, same, control, as, to, open, is, pressed, a, very, common, form, of, sliding, knife, is, the, sliding, utility, knife, commonly, known, as, a, stanley, knife, or, boxcutter, the, handles, of, knives, can, be, made, from, a, number, of, different, materials, each, of, which, has, advantages, and, disadvantages, handles, are, produced, in, a, wide, variety, of, shapes, and, styles, handles, are, often, textured, to, enhance, grip, more, exotic, materials, usually, only, seen, on, art, or, ceremonial, knives, include, stone, bone, mammoth, tooth, mammoth, ivory, oosik, walrus, penis, bone, walrus, tusk, antler, often, called, stag, in, a, knife, context, sheep, horn, buffalo, horn, teeth, and, mop, mother, of, pearl, or, pearl, many, materials, have, been, employed, in, knife, handles, handles, may, be, adapted, to, accommodate, the, needs, of, people, with, disabilities, for, example, knife, handles, may, be, made, thicker, or, with, more, cushioning, for, people, with, arthritis, in, their, hands, a, non, slip, handle, accommodates, people, with, palmar, hyperhidrosis, as, a, weapon, the, knife, is, universally, adopted, as, an, essential, tool, it, is, the, essential, element, of, a, knife, fight, for, example, a, primary, aspect, of, the, knife, as, a, tool, includes, dining, used, either, in, food, preparation, or, as, cutlery, examples, of, this, include, as, a, utility, tool, the, knife, can, take, many, forms, including, the, knife, plays, a, significant, role, in, some, cultures, through, ritual, and, superstition, as, the, knife, was, an, essential, tool, for, survival, since, early, man, knife, symbols, can, be, found, in, various, cultures, to, symbolize, all, stages, of, life, for, example, a, knife, placed, under, the, bed, while, giving, birth, is, said, to, ease, the, pain, or, stuck, into, the, headboard, of, a, cradle, to, protect, the, baby, knives, were, included, in, some, anglo, saxon, burial, rites, so, the, dead, would, not, be, defenseless, in, the, next, world, the, knife, plays, an, important, role, in, some, initiation, rites, and, many, cultures, perform, rituals, with, a, variety, of, knives, including, the, ceremonial, sacrifices, of, animals, samurai, warriors, as, part, of, bushido, could, perform, ritual, suicide, or, seppuku, with, a, tant, a, common, japanese, knife, an, athame, a, ceremonial, knife, is, used, in, wicca, and, derived, forms, of, neopagan, witchcraft, in, greece, a, black, handled, knife, placed, under, the, pillow, is, used, to, keep, away, nightmares, as, early, as, 1646, reference, is, made, to, a, superstition, of, laying, a, knife, across, another, piece, of, cutlery, being, a, sign, of, witchcraft, a, common, belief, is, that, if, a, knife, is, given, as, a, gift, the, relationship, of, the, giver, and, recipient, will, be, severed, something, such, as, a, small, coin, dove, or, a, valuable, item, is, exchanged, for, the, gift, rendering, payment, some, types, of, knives, are, restricted, by, law, and, carrying, of, knives, may, be, regulated, because, they, are, often, used, in, crime, although, restrictions, vary, greatly, by, jurisdiction, and, type, of, knife, for, example, some, laws, prohibit, carrying, knives, in, public, while, other, laws, prohibit, possession, of, certain, knives, such, as, switchblades
