cable, television, is, a, system, of, delivering, television, programming, to, consumers, via, radio, frequency, rf, signals, transmitted, through, coaxial, cables, or, in, more, recent, systems, light, pulses, through, fibre, optic, cables, this, contrasts, with, broadcast, television, in, which, the, television, signal, is, transmitted, over, the, air, by, radio, waves, and, received, by, a, television, antenna, or, satellite, television, in, which, the, television, signal, is, transmitted, over, the, air, by, radio, waves, from, a, communications, satellite, and, received, by, a, satellite, dish, on, the, roof, fm, radio, programming, high, speed, internet, telephone, services, and, similar, non, television, services, may, also, be, provided, through, these, cables, analog, television, was, standard, in, the, 20th, century, but, since, the, 2000s, cable, systems, have, been, upgraded, to, digital, cable, operation, a, cable, channel, sometimes, known, as, a, cable, network, is, a, television, network, available, via, cable, television, many, of, the, same, channels, are, distributed, through, satellite, television, alternative, terms, include, non, broadcast, channel, or, programming, service, the, latter, being, mainly, used, in, legal, contexts, the, abbreviation, catv, is, used, in, the, us, for, cable, television, and, originally, stood, for, community, antenna, television, from, cable, television, s, origins, in, 1948, in, areas, where, over, the, air, tv, reception, was, limited, by, distance, from, transmitters, or, mountainous, terrain, large, community, antennas, were, constructed, and, cable, was, run, from, them, to, individual, homes, in, 1968, 6, 4, of, americans, had, cable, television, the, number, increased, to, 7, 5, in, 1978, by, 1988, 52, 8, of, all, households, were, using, cable, the, number, further, increased, to, 62, 4, in, 1994, to, receive, cable, television, at, a, given, location, cable, distribution, lines, must, be, available, on, the, local, utility, poles, or, underground, utility, lines, coaxial, cable, brings, the, signal, to, the, customer, s, building, through, a, service, drop, an, overhead, or, underground, cable, if, the, subscriber, s, building, does, not, have, a, cable, service, drop, the, cable, company, will, install, one, the, standard, cable, used, in, the, u, s, is, rg, 6, which, has, a, 75, ohm, impedance, and, connects, with, a, type, f, connector, the, cable, company, s, portion, of, the, wiring, usually, ends, at, a, distribution, box, on, the, building, exterior, and, built, in, cable, wiring, in, the, walls, usually, distributes, the, signal, to, jacks, in, different, rooms, to, which, televisions, are, connected, multiple, cables, to, different, rooms, are, split, off, the, incoming, cable, with, a, small, device, called, a, splitter, there, are, two, standards, for, cable, television, older, analog, cable, and, newer, digital, cable, which, can, carry, data, signals, used, by, digital, television, receivers, such, as, high, definition, television, hdtv, equipment, all, cable, companies, in, the, united, states, have, switched, to, or, are, in, the, course, of, switching, to, digital, cable, television, since, it, was, first, introduced, in, the, late, 1990s, most, cable, companies, require, a, set, top, box, cable, converter, box, or, a, slot, on, one, s, tv, set, for, conditional, access, module, cards, to, view, their, cable, channels, even, on, newer, televisions, with, digital, cable, qam, tuners, because, most, digital, cable, channels, are, now, encrypted, or, scrambled, to, reduce, cable, service, theft, a, cable, from, the, jack, in, the, wall, is, attached, to, the, input, of, the, box, and, an, output, cable, from, the, box, is, attached, to, the, television, usually, the, rf, in, or, composite, input, on, older, tvs, since, the, set, top, box, only, decodes, the, single, channel, that, is, being, watched, each, television, in, the, house, requires, a, separate, box, some, unencrypted, channels, usually, traditional, over, the, air, broadcast, networks, can, be, displayed, without, a, receiver, box, the, cable, company, will, provide, set, top, boxes, based, on, the, level, of, service, a, customer, purchases, from, basic, set, top, boxes, with, a, standard, definition, picture, connected, through, the, standard, coaxial, connection, on, the, tv, to, high, definition, wireless, digital, video, recorder, dvr, receivers, connected, via, hdmi, or, component, older, analog, television, sets, are, cable, ready, and, can, receive, the, old, analog, cable, without, a, set, top, box, to, receive, digital, cable, channels, on, an, analog, television, set, even, unencrypted, ones, requires, a, different, type, of, box, a, digital, television, adapter, supplied, by, the, cable, company, or, purchased, by, the, subscriber, another, new, distribution, method, that, takes, advantage, of, the, low, cost, high, quality, dvb, distribution, to, residential, areas, uses, tv, gateways, to, convert, the, dvb, c, dvb, c2, stream, to, ip, for, distribution, of, tv, over, ip, network, in, the, home, many, cable, companies, offer, internet, access, through, docsis, in, the, most, common, system, multiple, television, channels, as, many, as, 500, although, this, varies, depending, on, the, provider, s, available, channel, capacity, are, distributed, to, subscriber, residences, through, a, coaxial, cable, which, comes, from, a, trunkline, supported, on, utility, poles, originating, at, the, cable, company, s, local, distribution, facility, called, the, headend, many, channels, can, be, transmitted, through, one, coaxial, cable, by, a, technique, called, frequency, division, multiplexing, at, the, headend, each, television, channel, is, translated, to, a, different, frequency, by, giving, each, channel, a, different, frequency, slot, on, the, cable, the, separate, television, signals, do, not, interfere, with, each, other, at, an, outdoor, cable, box, on, the, subscriber, s, residence, the, company, s, service, drop, cable, is, connected, to, cables, distributing, the, signal, to, different, rooms, in, the, building, at, each, television, the, subscriber, s, television, or, a, set, top, box, provided, by, the, cable, company, translates, the, desired, channel, back, to, its, original, frequency, baseband, and, it, is, displayed, onscreen, due, to, widespread, cable, theft, in, earlier, analog, systems, the, signals, are, typically, encrypted, on, modern, digital, cable, systems, and, the, set, top, box, must, be, activated, by, an, activation, code, sent, by, the, cable, company, before, it, will, function, which, is, only, sent, after, the, subscriber, signs, up, if, the, subscriber, fails, to, pay, their, bill, the, cable, company, can, send, a, signal, to, deactivate, the, subscriber, s, box, preventing, reception, there, are, also, usually, upstream, channels, on, the, cable, to, send, data, from, the, customer, box, to, the, cable, headend, for, advanced, features, such, as, requesting, pay, per, view, shows, or, movies, cable, internet, access, and, cable, telephone, service, the, downstream, channels, occupy, a, band, of, frequencies, from, approximately, 50, mhz, to, 1, ghz, while, the, upstream, channels, occupy, frequencies, of, 5, to, 42, mhz, subscribers, pay, with, a, monthly, fee, subscribers, can, choose, from, several, levels, of, service, with, premium, packages, including, more, channels, but, costing, a, higher, rate, at, the, local, headend, the, feed, signals, from, the, individual, television, channels, are, received, by, dish, antennas, from, communication, satellites, additional, local, channels, such, as, local, broadcast, television, stations, educational, channels, from, local, colleges, and, community, access, channels, devoted, to, local, governments, peg, channels, are, usually, included, on, the, cable, service, commercial, advertisements, for, local, business, are, also, inserted, in, the, programming, at, the, headend, the, individual, channels, which, are, distributed, nationally, also, have, their, own, nationally, oriented, commercials, modern, cable, systems, are, large, with, a, single, network, and, headend, often, serving, an, entire, metropolitan, area, most, systems, use, hybrid, fiber, coaxial, hfc, distribution, this, means, the, trunklines, that, carry, the, signal, from, the, headend, to, local, neighborhoods, are, optical, fiber, to, provide, greater, bandwidth, and, also, extra, capacity, for, future, expansion, at, the, headend, the, electrical, signal, is, translated, into, an, optical, signal, and, sent, through, the, fiber, the, fiber, trunkline, goes, to, several, distribution, hubs, from, which, multiple, fibers, fan, out, to, carry, the, signal, to, boxes, called, optical, nodes, in, local, communities, at, the, optical, node, the, optical, signal, is, translated, back, into, an, electrical, signal, and, carried, by, coaxial, cable, distribution, lines, on, utility, poles, from, which, cables, branch, out, to, a, series, of, signal, amplifiers, and, line, extenders, these, devices, carry, the, signal, to, customers, via, passive, rf, devices, called, taps, the, very, first, cable, networks, were, operated, locally, notably, in, 1936, by, rediffusion, in, london, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, same, year, in, berlin, in, germany, notably, for, the, olympic, games, and, from, 1948, onwards, in, the, united, states, and, switzerland, this, type, of, local, cable, network, was, mainly, used, to, relay, terrestrial, channels, in, geographical, areas, poorly, served, by, terrestrial, television, signals, cable, television, began, in, the, united, states, as, a, commercial, business, in, 1950s, the, early, systems, simply, received, weak, broadcast, channels, amplified, them, and, sent, them, over, unshielded, wires, to, the, subscribers, limited, to, a, community, or, to, adjacent, communities, the, receiving, antenna, would, be, taller, than, any, individual, subscriber, could, afford, thus, bringing, in, stronger, signals, in, hilly, or, mountainous, terrain, it, would, be, placed, at, a, high, elevation, at, the, outset, cable, systems, only, served, smaller, communities, without, television, stations, of, their, own, and, which, could, not, easily, receive, signals, from, stations, in, cities, because, of, distance, or, hilly, terrain, in, canada, however, communities, with, their, own, signals, were, fertile, cable, markets, as, viewers, wanted, to, receive, american, signals, rarely, as, in, the, college, town, of, alfred, new, york, u, s, cable, systems, retransmitted, canadian, channels, although, early, vhf, television, receivers, could, receive, 12, channels, 2, 13, the, maximum, number, of, channels, that, could, be, broadcast, in, one, city, was, 7, channels, 2, 4, either, 5, or, 6, 7, 9, 11, and, 13, as, receivers, at, the, time, were, unable, to, receive, strong, local, signals, on, adjacent, channels, without, distortion, there, were, frequency, gaps, between, 4, and, 5, and, between, 6, and, 7, which, allowed, both, to, be, used, in, the, same, city, as, equipment, improved, all, twelve, channels, could, be, utilized, except, where, a, local, vhf, television, station, broadcast, local, broadcast, channels, were, not, usable, for, signals, deemed, to, be, a, priority, but, technology, allowed, low, priority, signals, to, be, placed, on, such, channels, by, synchronizing, their, blanking, intervals, tvs, were, unable, to, reconcile, these, blanking, intervals, and, the, slight, changes, due, to, travel, through, a, medium, causing, ghosting, the, bandwidth, of, the, amplifiers, also, was, limited, meaning, frequencies, over, 250, mhz, were, difficult, to, transmit, to, distant, portions, of, the, coaxial, network, and, uhf, channels, could, not, be, used, at, all, to, expand, beyond, 12, channels, non, standard, midband, channels, had, to, be, used, located, between, the, fm, band, and, channel, 7, or, superband, beyond, channel, 13, up, to, about, 300, mhz, these, channels, initially, were, only, accessible, using, separate, tuner, boxes, that, sent, the, chosen, channel, into, the, tv, set, on, channel, 2, 3, or, 4, initially, uhf, broadcast, stations, were, at, a, disadvantage, because, the, standard, tv, sets, in, use, at, the, time, were, unable, to, receive, their, channels, with, the, passage, of, the, all, channel, receiver, act, in, 1964, all, new, television, sets, were, required, to, include, a, uhf, tuner, nonetheless, it, would, still, take, a, few, years, for, uhf, stations, to, become, competitive, before, being, added, to, the, cable, box, itself, these, midband, channels, were, used, for, early, incarnations, of, pay, tv, e, g, the, z, channel, los, angeles, and, hbo, but, transmitted, in, the, clear, i, e, not, scrambled, as, standard, tv, sets, of, the, period, could, not, pick, up, the, signal, nor, could, the, average, consumer, de, tune, the, normal, stations, to, be, able, to, receive, it, once, tuners, that, could, receive, select, mid, band, and, super, band, channels, began, to, be, incorporated, into, standard, television, sets, broadcasters, were, forced, to, either, install, scrambling, circuitry, or, move, these, signals, further, out, of, the, range, of, reception, for, early, cable, ready, tvs, and, vcrs, however, once, consumer, sets, had, the, ability, to, receive, all, 181, fcc, allocated, channels, premium, broadcasters, were, left, with, no, choice, but, to, scramble, the, descrambling, circuitry, was, often, published, in, electronics, hobby, magazines, such, as, popular, science, and, popular, electronics, allowing, anybody, with, anything, more, than, a, rudimentary, knowledge, of, broadcast, electronics, to, be, able, to, build, their, own, and, receive, the, programming, without, cost, later, the, cable, operators, began, to, carry, fm, radio, stations, and, encouraged, subscribers, to, connect, their, fm, stereo, sets, to, cable, before, stereo, and, bilingual, tv, sound, became, common, pay, tv, channel, sound, was, added, to, the, fm, stereo, cable, line, ups, about, this, time, operators, expanded, beyond, the, 12, channel, dial, to, use, the, midband, and, superband, vhf, channels, adjacent, to, the, high, band, 7, 13, of, north, american, television, frequencies, some, operators, as, in, cornwall, ontario, used, a, dual, distribution, network, with, channels, 2, 13, on, each, of, the, two, cables, during, the, 1980s, united, states, regulations, not, unlike, public, educational, and, government, access, peg, created, the, beginning, of, cable, originated, live, television, programming, as, cable, penetration, increased, numerous, cable, only, tv, stations, were, launched, many, with, their, own, news, bureaus, that, could, provide, more, immediate, and, more, localized, content, than, that, provided, by, the, nearest, network, newscast, such, stations, may, use, similar, on, air, branding, as, that, used, by, the, nearby, broadcast, network, affiliate, but, the, fact, that, these, stations, do, not, broadcast, over, the, air, and, are, not, regulated, by, the, fcc, their, call, signs, are, meaningless, these, stations, evolved, partially, into, today, s, over, the, air, digital, subchannels, where, a, main, broadcast, tv, station, e, g, nbs, 37, would, in, the, case, of, no, local, cnb, or, abs, station, being, available, rebroadcast, the, programming, from, a, nearby, affiliate, but, fill, in, with, its, own, news, and, other, community, programming, to, suit, its, own, locale, many, live, local, programs, with, local, interests, were, subsequently, created, all, over, the, united, states, in, most, major, television, markets, in, the, early, 1980s, this, evolved, into, today, s, many, cable, only, broadcasts, of, diverse, programming, including, cable, only, produced, television, movies, and, miniseries, cable, specialty, channels, starting, with, channels, oriented, to, show, movies, and, large, sporting, or, performance, events, diversified, further, and, narrowcasting, became, common, by, the, late, 1980s, cable, only, signals, outnumbered, broadcast, signals, on, cable, systems, some, of, which, by, this, time, had, expanded, beyond, 35, channels, by, the, mid, 1980s, in, canada, cable, operators, were, allowed, by, the, regulators, to, enter, into, distribution, contracts, with, cable, networks, on, their, own, by, the, 1990s, tiers, became, common, with, customers, able, to, subscribe, to, different, tiers, to, obtain, different, selections, of, additional, channels, above, the, basic, selection, by, subscribing, to, additional, tiers, customers, could, get, specialty, channels, movie, channels, and, foreign, channels, large, cable, companies, used, addressable, descramblers, to, limit, access, to, premium, channels, for, customers, not, subscribing, to, higher, tiers, however, the, above, magazines, often, published, workarounds, for, that, technology, as, well, during, the, 1990s, the, pressure, to, accommodate, the, growing, array, of, offerings, resulted, in, digital, transmission, that, made, more, efficient, use, of, the, vhf, signal, capacity, fibre, optics, was, common, to, carry, signals, into, areas, near, the, home, where, coax, could, carry, higher, frequencies, over, the, short, remaining, distance, although, for, a, time, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, television, receivers, and, vcrs, were, equipped, to, receive, the, mid, band, and, super, band, channels, due, to, the, fact, that, the, descrambling, circuitry, was, for, a, time, present, in, these, tuners, depriving, the, cable, operator, of, much, of, their, revenue, such, cable, ready, tuners, are, rarely, used, now, requiring, a, return, to, the, set, top, boxes, used, from, the, 1970s, onward, the, digital, television, transition, in, the, united, states, has, put, all, signals, broadcast, and, cable, into, digital, form, rendering, analog, cable, television, service, a, rarity, found, in, an, ever, dwindling, number, of, markets, analog, television, sets, are, accommodated, their, tuners, mostly, obsolete, and, dependent, entirely, on, the, set, top, box, cable, television, is, mostly, available, in, north, america, europe, australia, asia, and, south, america, cable, television, has, had, little, success, in, africa, as, it, is, not, cost, effective, to, lay, cables, in, sparsely, populated, areas, multichannel, multipoint, distribution, service, a, microwave, based, system, may, be, used, instead, coaxial, cables, are, capable, of, bi, directional, carriage, of, signals, as, well, as, the, transmission, of, large, amounts, of, data, cable, television, signals, use, only, a, portion, of, the, bandwidth, available, over, coaxial, lines, this, leaves, plenty, of, space, available, for, other, digital, services, such, as, cable, internet, cable, telephony, and, wireless, services, using, both, unlicensed, and, licensed, spectra, broadband, internet, access, is, achieved, over, coaxial, cable, by, using, cable, modems, to, convert, the, network, data, into, a, type, of, digital, signal, that, can, be, transferred, over, coaxial, cable, one, problem, with, some, cable, systems, is, the, older, amplifiers, placed, along, the, cable, routes, are, unidirectional, thus, in, order, to, allow, for, uploading, of, data, the, customer, would, need, to, use, an, analog, telephone, modem, to, provide, for, the, upstream, connection, this, limited, the, upstream, speed, to, 31, 2, kbp, s, and, prevented, the, always, on, convenience, broadband, internet, typically, provides, many, large, cable, systems, have, upgraded, or, are, upgrading, their, equipment, to, allow, for, bi, directional, signals, thus, allowing, for, greater, upload, speed, and, always, on, convenience, though, these, upgrades, are, expensive, in, north, america, australia, and, europe, many, cable, operators, have, already, introduced, cable, telephone, service, which, operates, just, like, existing, fixed, line, operators, this, service, involves, installing, a, special, telephone, interface, at, the, customer, s, premises, that, converts, the, analog, signals, from, the, customer, s, in, home, wiring, into, a, digital, signal, which, is, then, sent, on, the, local, loop, replacing, the, analog, last, mile, or, plain, old, telephone, service, pots, to, the, company, s, switching, center, where, it, is, connected, to, the, public, switched, telephone, network, pstn, the, biggest, obstacle, to, cable, telephone, service, is, the, need, for, nearly, 100, reliable, service, for, emergency, calls, one, of, the, standards, available, for, digital, cable, telephony, packetcable, seems, to, be, the, most, promising, and, able, to, work, with, the, quality, of, service, qos, demands, of, traditional, analog, plain, old, telephone, service, pots, service, the, biggest, advantage, to, digital, cable, telephone, service, is, similar, to, the, advantage, of, digital, cable, namely, that, data, can, be, compressed, resulting, in, much, less, bandwidth, used, than, a, dedicated, analog, circuit, switched, service, other, advantages, include, better, voice, quality, and, integration, to, a, voice, over, internet, protocol, voip, network, providing, cheap, or, unlimited, nationwide, and, international, calling, in, many, cases, digital, cable, telephone, service, is, separate, from, cable, modem, service, being, offered, by, many, cable, companies, and, does, not, rely, on, internet, protocol, ip, traffic, or, the, internet, traditional, cable, television, providers, and, traditional, telecommunication, companies, increasingly, compete, in, providing, voice, video, and, data, services, to, residences, the, combination, of, television, telephone, and, internet, access, is, commonly, called, triple, play, regardless, of, whether, catv, or, telcos, offer, it, 1, more, than, 400, 000, television, service, subscribers
