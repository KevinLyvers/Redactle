a, thermometer, is, a, device, that, measures, temperature, the, degree, of, hotness, or, coldness, of, an, object, or, temperature, gradient, the, rates, of, change, of, temperature, in, space, a, thermometer, has, two, important, elements, 1, a, temperature, sensor, e, g, the, bulb, of, a, mercury, in, glass, thermometer, or, the, pyrometric, sensor, in, an, infrared, thermometer, in, which, some, change, occurs, with, a, change, in, temperature, and, 2, some, means, of, converting, this, change, into, a, numerical, value, e, g, the, visible, scale, that, is, marked, on, a, mercury, in, glass, thermometer, or, the, digital, readout, on, an, infrared, model, thermometers, are, widely, used, in, technology, and, industry, to, monitor, processes, in, meteorology, in, medicine, medical, thermometer, and, in, scientific, research, while, an, individual, thermometer, is, able, to, measure, degrees, of, hotness, the, readings, on, two, thermometers, cannot, be, compared, unless, they, conform, to, an, agreed, scale, today, there, is, an, absolute, thermodynamic, temperature, scale, internationally, agreed, temperature, scales, are, designed, to, approximate, this, closely, based, on, fixed, points, and, interpolating, thermometers, the, most, recent, official, temperature, scale, is, the, international, temperature, scale, of, 1990, it, extends, from, 0, 65, k, 272, 5, c, 458, 5, f, to, approximately, 1, 358, k, 1, 085, c, 1, 985, f, sparse, and, conflicting, historical, records, make, it, difficult, to, pinpoint, the, invention, of, the, thermometer, to, any, single, person, or, date, with, certitude, in, addition, given, the, many, parallel, developments, in, the, thermometer, s, history, and, its, many, gradual, improvements, over, time, the, instrument, is, best, viewed, not, as, a, single, invention, but, an, evolving, technology, early, pneumatic, devices, and, ideas, from, antiquity, provided, inspiration, for, the, thermometer, s, invention, during, the, renaissance, period, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, philo, of, byzantium, documented, his, experiment, with, a, tube, submerged, in, a, container, of, liquid, on, one, end, and, connected, to, an, air, tight, hollow, sphere, on, the, other, when, air, in, the, sphere, is, heated, with, a, candle, or, by, exposing, it, to, the, sun, expanding, air, exits, the, sphere, and, generates, bubbles, in, the, vessel, as, air, in, the, sphere, cools, a, partial, vacuum, is, created, sucking, liquid, up, into, the, tube, any, changes, in, the, position, of, the, liquid, will, now, indicate, whether, the, air, in, the, sphere, is, getting, hotter, or, colder, translations, of, philo, s, experiment, from, the, original, ancient, greek, were, utilized, by, robert, fludd, sometime, around, 1617, and, used, as, the, basis, for, his, air, thermometer, 15, in, his, book, pneumatics, hero, of, alexandria, 10, 70, ad, provides, a, recipe, for, building, a, fountain, which, trickles, by, the, action, of, the, sun, s, rays, a, more, elaborate, version, of, philo, s, pneumatic, experiment, but, which, worked, on, the, same, principle, of, heating, and, cooling, air, to, move, water, around, translations, of, the, ancient, work, pneumatics, were, introduced, to, late, 16th, century, italy, and, studied, by, many, including, galileo, galilei, who, had, read, it, by, 1594, 5, the, roman, greek, physician, galen, is, given, credit, for, introducing, two, concepts, important, to, the, development, of, a, scale, of, temperature, and, the, eventual, invention, of, the, thermometer, first, he, had, the, idea, that, hotness, or, coldness, may, be, measured, by, degrees, of, hot, and, cold, he, also, conceived, of, a, fixed, reference, temperature, a, mixture, of, equal, amounts, of, ice, and, boiling, water, with, four, degrees, of, heat, above, this, point, and, four, degrees, of, cold, below, 16th, century, physician, johann, hasler, developed, body, temperature, scales, based, on, galen, s, theory, of, degrees, to, help, him, mix, the, appropriate, amount, of, medicine, for, patients, 3, in, the, late, 16th, and, early, 17th, centuries, several, european, scientists, notably, galileo, galilei, and, italian, physiologist, santorio, santorio, developed, devices, with, an, air, filled, glass, bulb, connected, to, a, tube, partially, filled, with, water, as, the, air, in, the, bulb, warms, or, cools, the, height, of, the, column, of, water, in, the, tube, falls, or, rises, allowing, an, observer, to, compare, the, current, height, of, the, water, to, previous, heights, to, detect, relative, changes, of, the, heat, in, the, bulb, and, its, immediate, environment, such, devices, with, no, scale, for, assigning, a, numerical, value, to, the, height, of, the, liquid, are, referred, to, as, a, thermoscope, because, they, provide, an, observable, indication, of, sensible, heat, the, modern, concept, of, temperature, was, yet, to, arise, the, difference, between, a, thermoscope, and, a, thermometer, is, that, the, latter, has, a, scale, 4, a, thermometer, is, simply, a, thermoscope, with, a, scale, i, propose, to, regard, it, as, axiomatic, that, a, meter, must, have, a, scale, or, something, equivalent, if, this, is, admitted, the, problem, of, the, invention, of, the, thermometer, becomes, more, straightforward, that, of, the, invention, of, the, thermoscope, remains, as, obscure, as, ever, given, this, the, possible, inventors, of, the, thermometer, are, usually, considered, to, be, galileo, santorio, dutch, inventor, cornelis, drebbel, or, british, mathematician, robert, fludd, 5, though, galileo, is, often, said, to, be, the, inventor, of, the, thermometer, there, is, no, surviving, document, that, he, actually, produced, any, such, instrument, the, first, clear, diagram, of, a, thermoscope, was, published, in, 1617, by, giuseppe, biancani, 1566, 1624, 10, the, first, showing, a, scale, and, thus, constituting, a, thermometer, was, by, santorio, santorio, in, 1625, this, was, a, vertical, tube, closed, by, a, bulb, of, air, at, the, top, with, the, lower, end, opening, into, a, vessel, of, water, the, water, level, in, the, tube, was, controlled, by, the, expansion, and, contraction, of, the, air, so, it, was, what, we, would, now, call, an, air, thermometer, the, word, thermometer, in, its, french, form, first, appeared, in, 1624, in, la, r, cr, ation, math, matique, by, jean, leurechon, who, describes, one, with, a, scale, of, 8, degrees, the, word, comes, from, the, greek, words, thermos, meaning, hot, and, metron, meaning, measure, the, above, instruments, suffered, from, the, disadvantage, that, they, were, also, barometers, i, e, sensitive, to, air, pressure, in, 1629, joseph, solomon, delmedigo, a, student, of, galileo, and, santorio, in, padua, published, what, is, apparently, the, first, description, and, illustration, of, a, sealed, liquid, in, glass, thermometer, it, is, described, as, having, a, bulb, at, the, bottom, of, a, sealed, tube, partially, filled, with, brandy, the, tube, had, a, numbered, scale, delmedigo, did, not, claim, to, have, invented, this, instrument, nor, did, he, name, anyone, else, as, its, inventor, in, about, 1654, ferdinando, ii, de, medici, grand, duke, of, tuscany, 1610, 1670, did, produce, such, an, instrument, the, first, modern, style, thermometer, dependent, on, the, expansion, of, a, liquid, and, independent, of, air, pressure, many, other, scientists, experimented, with, various, liquids, and, designs, of, thermometer, however, each, inventor, and, each, thermometer, was, unique, there, was, no, standard, scale, early, attempts, at, standardization, added, a, single, reference, point, such, as, the, freezing, point, of, water, the, use, of, two, references, for, graduating, the, thermometer, is, said, to, have, been, introduced, by, joachim, dalence, in, 1668, although, christiaan, huygens, 1629, 1695, in, 1665, had, already, suggested, the, use, of, graduations, based, on, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, water, as, standards, and, in, 1694, carlo, renaldini, 1615, 1698, proposed, using, them, as, fixed, points, along, a, universal, scale, in, 1701, isaac, newton, 1642, 1726, 27, proposed, a, scale, of, 12, degrees, between, the, melting, point, of, ice, and, body, temperature, in, 1714, scientist, and, inventor, daniel, gabriel, fahrenheit, invented, a, reliable, thermometer, using, mercury, instead, of, alcohol, and, water, mixtures, in, 1724, he, proposed, a, temperature, scale, which, now, slightly, adjusted, bears, his, name, in, 1742, anders, celsius, 1701, 1744, proposed, a, scale, with, zero, at, the, boiling, point, and, 100, degrees, at, the, freezing, point, of, water, though, the, scale, which, now, bears, his, name, has, them, the, other, way, around, french, entomologist, ren, antoine, ferchault, de, r, aumur, invented, an, alcohol, thermometer, and, temperature, scale, in, 1730, that, ultimately, proved, to, be, less, reliable, than, fahrenheit, s, mercury, thermometer, the, first, physician, to, use, thermometer, measurements, in, clinical, practice, was, herman, boerhaave, 1668, 1738, in, 1866, sir, thomas, clifford, allbutt, 1836, 1925, invented, a, clinical, thermometer, that, produced, a, body, temperature, reading, in, five, minutes, as, opposed, to, twenty, in, 1999, dr, francesco, pompei, of, the, exergen, corporation, introduced, the, world, s, first, temporal, artery, thermometer, a, non, invasive, temperature, sensor, which, scans, the, forehead, in, about, two, seconds, and, provides, a, medically, accurate, body, temperature, traditional, thermometers, were, all, non, registering, thermometers, that, is, the, thermometer, did, not, hold, the, temperature, reading, after, it, was, moved, to, a, place, with, a, different, temperature, determining, the, temperature, of, a, pot, of, hot, liquid, required, the, user, to, leave, the, thermometer, in, the, hot, liquid, until, after, reading, it, if, the, non, registering, thermometer, was, removed, from, the, hot, liquid, then, the, temperature, indicated, on, the, thermometer, would, immediately, begin, changing, to, reflect, the, temperature, of, its, new, conditions, in, this, case, the, air, temperature, registering, thermometers, are, designed, to, hold, the, temperature, indefinitely, so, that, the, thermometer, can, be, removed, and, read, at, a, later, time, or, in, a, more, convenient, place, mechanical, registering, thermometers, hold, either, the, highest, or, lowest, temperature, recorded, until, manually, re, set, e, g, by, shaking, down, a, mercury, in, glass, thermometer, or, until, an, even, more, extreme, temperature, is, experienced, electronic, registering, thermometers, may, be, designed, to, remember, the, highest, or, lowest, temperature, or, to, remember, whatever, temperature, was, present, at, a, specified, point, in, time, thermometers, increasingly, use, electronic, means, to, provide, a, digital, display, or, input, to, a, computer, thermometers, may, be, described, as, empirical, or, absolute, absolute, thermometers, are, calibrated, numerically, by, the, thermodynamic, absolute, temperature, scale, empirical, thermometers, are, not, in, general, necessarily, in, exact, agreement, with, absolute, thermometers, as, to, their, numerical, scale, readings, but, to, qualify, as, thermometers, at, all, they, must, agree, with, absolute, thermometers, and, with, each, other, in, the, following, way, given, any, two, bodies, isolated, in, their, separate, respective, thermodynamic, equilibrium, states, all, thermometers, agree, as, to, which, of, the, two, has, the, higher, temperature, or, that, the, two, have, equal, temperatures, for, any, two, empirical, thermometers, this, does, not, require, that, the, relation, between, their, numerical, scale, readings, be, linear, but, it, does, require, that, relation, to, be, strictly, monotonic, this, is, a, fundamental, character, of, temperature, and, thermometers, as, it, is, customarily, stated, in, textbooks, taken, alone, the, so, called, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, fails, to, deliver, this, information, but, the, statement, of, the, zeroth, law, of, thermodynamics, by, james, serrin, in, 1977, though, rather, mathematically, abstract, is, more, informative, for, thermometry, zeroth, law, there, exists, a, topological, line, m, displaystyle, m, which, serves, as, a, coordinate, manifold, of, material, behaviour, the, points, l, displaystyle, l, of, the, manifold, m, displaystyle, m, are, called, hotness, levels, and, m, displaystyle, m, is, called, the, universal, hotness, manifold, to, this, information, there, needs, to, be, added, a, sense, of, greater, hotness, this, sense, can, be, had, independently, of, calorimetry, of, thermodynamics, and, of, properties, of, particular, materials, from, wien, s, displacement, law, of, thermal, radiation, the, temperature, of, a, bath, of, thermal, radiation, is, proportional, by, a, universal, constant, to, the, frequency, of, the, maximum, of, its, frequency, spectrum, this, frequency, is, always, positive, but, can, have, values, that, tend, to, zero, another, way, of, identifying, hotter, as, opposed, to, colder, conditions, is, supplied, by, planck, s, principle, that, when, a, process, of, isochoric, adiabatic, work, is, the, sole, means, of, change, of, internal, energy, of, a, closed, system, the, final, state, of, the, system, is, never, colder, than, the, initial, state, except, for, phase, changes, with, latent, heat, it, is, hotter, than, the, initial, state, there, are, several, principles, on, which, empirical, thermometers, are, built, as, listed, in, the, section, of, this, article, entitled, primary, and, secondary, thermometers, several, such, principles, are, essentially, based, on, the, constitutive, relation, between, the, state, of, a, suitably, selected, particular, material, and, its, temperature, only, some, materials, are, suitable, for, this, purpose, and, they, may, be, considered, as, thermometric, materials, radiometric, thermometry, in, contrast, can, be, only, slightly, dependent, on, the, constitutive, relations, of, materials, in, a, sense, then, radiometric, thermometry, might, be, thought, of, as, universal, this, is, because, it, rests, mainly, on, a, universality, character, of, thermodynamic, equilibrium, that, it, has, the, universal, property, of, producing, blackbody, radiation, there, are, various, kinds, of, empirical, thermometer, based, on, material, properties, many, empirical, thermometers, rely, on, the, constitutive, relation, between, pressure, volume, and, temperature, of, their, thermometric, material, for, example, mercury, expands, when, heated, if, it, is, used, for, its, relation, between, pressure, and, volume, and, temperature, a, thermometric, material, must, have, three, properties, 1, its, heating, and, cooling, must, be, rapid, that, is, to, say, when, a, quantity, of, heat, enters, or, leaves, a, body, of, the, material, the, material, must, expand, or, contract, to, its, final, volume, or, reach, its, final, pressure, and, must, reach, its, final, temperature, with, practically, no, delay, some, of, the, heat, that, enters, can, be, considered, to, change, the, volume, of, the, body, at, constant, temperature, and, is, called, the, latent, heat, of, expansion, at, constant, temperature, and, the, rest, of, it, can, be, considered, to, change, the, temperature, of, the, body, at, constant, volume, and, is, called, the, specific, heat, at, constant, volume, some, materials, do, not, have, this, property, and, take, some, time, to, distribute, the, heat, between, temperature, and, volume, change, 2, its, heating, and, cooling, must, be, reversible, that, is, to, say, the, material, must, be, able, to, be, heated, and, cooled, indefinitely, often, by, the, same, increment, and, decrement, of, heat, and, still, return, to, its, original, pressure, volume, and, temperature, every, time, some, plastics, do, not, have, this, property, 3, its, heating, and, cooling, must, be, monotonic, that, is, to, say, throughout, the, range, of, temperatures, for, which, it, is, intended, to, work, at, temperatures, around, about, 4, c, water, does, not, have, the, property, 3, and, is, said, to, behave, anomalously, in, this, respect, thus, water, cannot, be, used, as, a, material, for, this, kind, of, thermometry, for, temperature, ranges, near, 4, c, gases, on, the, other, hand, all, have, the, properties, 1, 2, and, 3, a, and, 3, b, consequently, they, are, suitable, thermometric, materials, and, that, is, why, they, were, important, in, the, development, of, thermometry, according, to, preston, 1894, 1904, regnault, found, constant, pressure, air, thermometers, unsatisfactory, because, they, needed, troublesome, corrections, he, therefore, built, a, constant, volume, air, thermometer, constant, volume, thermometers, do, not, provide, a, way, to, avoid, the, problem, of, anomalous, behaviour, like, that, of, water, at, approximately, 4, c, planck, s, law, very, accurately, quantitatively, describes, the, power, spectral, density, of, electromagnetic, radiation, inside, a, rigid, walled, cavity, in, a, body, made, of, material, that, is, completely, opaque, and, poorly, reflective, when, it, has, reached, thermodynamic, equilibrium, as, a, function, of, absolute, thermodynamic, temperature, alone, a, small, enough, hole, in, the, wall, of, the, cavity, emits, near, enough, blackbody, radiation, of, which, the, spectral, radiance, can, be, precisely, measured, the, walls, of, the, cavity, provided, they, are, completely, opaque, and, poorly, reflective, can, be, of, any, material, indifferently, this, provides, a, well, reproducible, absolute, thermometer, over, a, very, wide, range, of, temperatures, able, to, measure, the, absolute, temperature, of, a, body, inside, the, cavity, a, thermometer, is, called, primary, or, secondary, based, on, how, the, raw, physical, quantity, it, measures, is, mapped, to, a, temperature, as, summarized, by, kauppinen, et, al, for, primary, thermometers, the, measured, property, of, matter, is, known, so, well, that, temperature, can, be, calculated, without, any, unknown, quantities, examples, of, these, are, thermometers, based, on, the, equation, of, state, of, a, gas, on, the, velocity, of, sound, in, a, gas, on, the, thermal, noise, voltage, or, current, of, an, electrical, resistor, and, on, the, angular, anisotropy, of, gamma, ray, emission, of, certain, radioactive, nuclei, in, a, magnetic, field, in, contrast, secondary, thermometers, are, most, widely, used, because, of, their, convenience, also, they, are, often, much, more, sensitive, than, primary, ones, for, secondary, thermometers, knowledge, of, the, measured, property, is, not, sufficient, to, allow, direct, calculation, of, temperature, they, have, to, be, calibrated, against, a, primary, thermometer, at, least, at, one, temperature, or, at, a, number, of, fixed, temperatures, such, fixed, points, for, example, triple, points, and, superconducting, transitions, occur, reproducibly, at, the, same, temperature, thermometers, can, be, calibrated, either, by, comparing, them, with, other, calibrated, thermometers, or, by, checking, them, against, known, fixed, points, on, the, temperature, scale, the, best, known, of, these, fixed, points, are, the, melting, and, boiling, points, of, pure, water, note, that, the, boiling, point, of, water, varies, with, pressure, so, this, must, be, controlled, the, traditional, way, of, putting, a, scale, on, a, liquid, in, glass, or, liquid, in, metal, thermometer, was, in, three, stages, other, fixed, points, used, in, the, past, are, the, body, temperature, of, a, healthy, adult, male, which, was, originally, used, by, fahrenheit, as, his, upper, fixed, point, 96, f, 35, 6, c, to, be, a, number, divisible, by, 12, and, the, lowest, temperature, given, by, a, mixture, of, salt, and, ice, which, was, originally, the, definition, of, 0, f, 17, 8, c, this, is, an, example, of, a, frigorific, mixture, as, body, temperature, varies, the, fahrenheit, scale, was, later, changed, to, use, an, upper, fixed, point, of, boiling, water, at, 212, f, 100, c, these, have, now, been, replaced, by, the, defining, points, in, the, international, temperature, scale, of, 1990, though, in, practice, the, melting, point, of, water, is, more, commonly, used, than, its, triple, point, the, latter, being, more, difficult, to, manage, and, thus, restricted, to, critical, standard, measurement, nowadays, manufacturers, will, often, use, a, thermostat, bath, or, solid, block, where, the, temperature, is, held, constant, relative, to, a, calibrated, thermometer, other, thermometers, to, be, calibrated, are, put, into, the, same, bath, or, block, and, allowed, to, come, to, equilibrium, then, the, scale, marked, or, any, deviation, from, the, instrument, scale, recorded, for, many, modern, devices, calibration, will, be, stating, some, value, to, be, used, in, processing, an, electronic, signal, to, convert, it, to, a, temperature, the, precision, or, resolution, of, a, thermometer, is, simply, to, what, fraction, of, a, degree, it, is, possible, to, make, a, reading, for, high, temperature, work, it, may, only, be, possible, to, measure, to, the, nearest, 10, c, or, more, clinical, thermometers, and, many, electronic, thermometers, are, usually, readable, to, 0, 1, c, special, instruments, can, give, readings, to, one, thousandth, of, a, degree, however, this, precision, does, not, mean, the, reading, is, true, or, accurate, it, only, means, that, very, small, changes, can, be, observed, a, thermometer, calibrated, to, a, known, fixed, point, is, accurate, i, e, gives, a, true, reading, at, that, point, the, invention, of, the, technology, to, measure, temperature, led, to, the, creation, of, scales, of, temperature, in, between, fixed, calibration, points, interpolation, is, used, usually, linear, this, may, give, significant, differences, between, different, types, of, thermometer, at, points, far, away, from, the, fixed, points, for, example, the, expansion, of, mercury, in, a, glass, thermometer, is, slightly, different, from, the, change, in, resistance, of, a, platinum, resistance, thermometer, so, these, two, will, disagree, slightly, at, around, 50, c, there, may, be, other, causes, due, to, imperfections, in, the, instrument, e, g, in, a, liquid, in, glass, thermometer, if, the, capillary, tube, varies, in, diameter, for, many, purposes, reproducibility, is, important, that, is, does, the, same, thermometer, give, the, same, reading, for, the, same, temperature, or, do, replacement, or, multiple, thermometers, give, the, same, reading, reproducible, temperature, measurement, means, that, comparisons, are, valid, in, scientific, experiments, and, industrial, processes, are, consistent, thus, if, the, same, type, of, thermometer, is, calibrated, in, the, same, way, its, readings, will, be, valid, even, if, it, is, slightly, inaccurate, compared, to, the, absolute, scale, an, example, of, a, reference, thermometer, used, to, check, others, to, industrial, standards, would, be, a, platinum, resistance, thermometer, with, a, digital, display, to, 0, 1, c, its, precision, which, has, been, calibrated, at, 5, points, against, national, standards, 18, 0, 40, 70, 100, c, and, which, is, certified, to, an, accuracy, of, 0, 2, c, according, to, british, standards, correctly, calibrated, used, and, maintained, liquid, in, glass, thermometers, can, achieve, a, measurement, uncertainty, of, 0, 01, c, in, the, range, 0, to, 100, c, and, a, larger, uncertainty, outside, this, range, 0, 05, c, up, to, 200, or, down, to, 40, c, 0, 2, c, up, to, 450, or, down, to, 80, c, thermometers, utilize, a, range, of, physical, effects, to, measure, temperature, temperature, sensors, are, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, scientific, and, engineering, applications, especially, measurement, systems, temperature, systems, are, primarily, either, electrical, or, mechanical, occasionally, inseparable, from, the, system, which, they, control, as, in, the, case, of, a, mercury, in, glass, thermometer, thermometers, are, used, in, roadways, in, cold, weather, climates, to, help, determine, if, icing, conditions, exist, indoors, thermistors, are, used, in, climate, control, systems, such, as, air, conditioners, freezers, heaters, refrigerators, and, water, heaters, galileo, thermometers, are, used, to, measure, indoor, air, temperature, due, to, their, limited, measurement, range, such, liquid, crystal, thermometers, which, use, thermochromic, liquid, crystals, are, also, used, in, mood, rings, and, used, to, measure, the, temperature, of, water, in, fish, tanks, fiber, bragg, grating, temperature, sensors, are, used, in, nuclear, power, facilities, to, monitor, reactor, core, temperatures, and, avoid, the, possibility, of, nuclear, meltdowns, nanothermometry, is, an, emergent, research, field, dealing, with, the, knowledge, of, temperature, in, the, sub, micrometric, scale, conventional, thermometers, cannot, measure, the, temperature, of, an, object, which, is, smaller, than, a, micrometre, and, new, methods, and, materials, have, to, be, used, nanothermometry, is, used, in, such, cases, nanothermometers, are, classified, as, luminescent, thermometers, if, they, use, light, to, measure, temperature, and, non, luminescent, thermometers, systems, where, thermometric, properties, are, not, directly, related, to, luminescence, thermometers, used, specifically, for, low, temperatures, various, thermometric, techniques, have, been, used, throughout, history, such, as, the, galileo, thermometer, to, thermal, imaging, medical, thermometers, such, as, mercury, in, glass, thermometers, infrared, thermometers,
