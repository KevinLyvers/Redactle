an, aircraft, carrier, is, a, warship, that, serves, as, a, seagoing, airbase, equipped, with, a, full, length, flight, deck, and, facilities, for, carrying, arming, deploying, and, recovering, aircraft, typically, it, is, the, capital, ship, of, a, fleet, as, it, allows, a, naval, force, to, project, air, power, worldwide, without, depending, on, local, bases, for, staging, aircraft, operations, carriers, have, evolved, since, their, inception, in, the, early, twentieth, century, from, wooden, vessels, used, to, deploy, balloons, to, nuclear, powered, warships, that, carry, numerous, fighters, strike, aircraft, helicopters, and, other, types, of, aircraft, while, heavier, aircraft, such, as, fixed, wing, gunships, and, bombers, have, been, launched, from, aircraft, carriers, these, aircraft, have, not, landed, on, a, carrier, by, its, diplomatic, and, tactical, power, its, mobility, its, autonomy, and, the, variety, of, its, means, the, aircraft, carrier, is, often, the, centerpiece, of, modern, combat, fleets, tactically, or, even, strategically, it, replaced, the, battleship, in, the, role, of, flagship, of, a, fleet, one, of, its, great, advantages, is, that, by, sailing, in, international, waters, it, does, not, interfere, with, any, territorial, sovereignty, and, thus, obviates, the, need, for, overflight, authorizations, from, third, party, countries, reduces, the, times, and, transit, distances, of, aircraft, and, therefore, significantly, increases, the, time, of, availability, on, the, combat, zone, there, is, no, single, definition, of, an, aircraft, carrier, and, modern, navies, use, several, variants, of, the, type, these, variants, are, sometimes, categorized, as, sub, types, of, aircraft, carriers, and, sometimes, as, distinct, types, of, naval, aviation, capable, ships, aircraft, carriers, may, be, classified, according, to, the, type, of, aircraft, they, carry, and, their, operational, assignments, admiral, sir, mark, stanhope, rn, former, first, sea, lord, head, of, the, royal, navy, has, said, to, put, it, simply, countries, that, aspire, to, strategic, international, influence, have, aircraft, carriers, henry, kissinger, while, united, states, secretary, of, state, also, said, an, aircraft, carrier, is, 100, 000, tons, of, diplomacy, as, of, september, 2024, there, are, 47, active, aircraft, carriers, in, the, world, operated, by, fourteen, navies, the, united, states, navy, has, 11, large, nuclear, powered, fleet, carriers, carrying, around, 80, fighters, each, the, largest, carriers, in, the, world, the, total, combined, deck, space, is, over, twice, that, of, all, other, nations, combined, as, well, as, the, aircraft, carrier, fleet, the, us, navy, has, nine, amphibious, assault, ships, used, primarily, for, helicopters, although, these, also, each, carry, up, to, 20, vertical, or, short, take, off, and, landing, v, stol, fighter, jets, and, are, similar, in, size, to, medium, sized, fleet, carriers, india, the, united, kingdom, and, china, each, operate, two, aircraft, carriers, france, and, russia, each, operate, a, single, aircraft, carrier, with, a, capacity, of, 30, to, 60, fighters, italy, operates, two, light, v, stol, carriers, and, spain, operates, one, v, stol, aircraft, carrying, assault, ship, helicopter, carriers, are, operated, by, japan, 4, two, of, which, are, being, converted, to, operate, v, stol, fighters, france, 3, australia, 2, egypt, 2, south, korea, 2, china, 3, thailand, 1, and, brazil, 1, future, aircraft, carriers, are, under, construction, or, in, planning, by, china, france, india, russia, south, korea, turkey, and, the, us, some, of, the, types, listed, here, are, not, strictly, defined, as, aircraft, carriers, by, some, sources, a, fleet, carrier, is, intended, to, operate, with, the, main, fleet, and, usually, provides, an, offensive, capability, these, are, the, largest, carriers, capable, of, fast, speeds, by, comparison, escort, carriers, were, developed, to, provide, defense, for, convoys, of, ships, they, were, smaller, and, slower, with, lower, numbers, of, aircraft, carried, most, were, built, from, mercantile, hulls, or, in, the, case, of, merchant, aircraft, carriers, were, bulk, cargo, ships, with, a, flight, deck, added, on, top, light, aircraft, carriers, were, fast, enough, to, operate, with, the, main, fleet, but, of, smaller, size, with, reduced, aircraft, capacity, the, soviet, aircraft, carrier, admiral, kusnetsov, was, termed, a, heavy, aircraft, carrying, cruiser, this, was, primarily, a, legal, construct, to, avoid, the, limitations, of, the, montreux, convention, preventing, aircraft, carriers, transiting, the, turkish, straits, between, the, soviet, black, sea, bases, and, the, mediterranean, sea, these, ships, while, sized, in, the, range, of, large, fleet, carriers, were, designed, to, deploy, alone, or, with, escorts, in, addition, to, supporting, fighter, aircraft, and, helicopters, they, provide, both, strong, defensive, weaponry, and, heavy, offensive, missiles, equivalent, to, a, guided, missile, cruiser, aircraft, carriers, today, are, usually, divided, into, the, following, four, categories, based, on, the, way, that, aircraft, take, off, and, land, the, appellation, supercarrier, is, not, an, official, designation, with, any, national, navy, but, a, term, used, predominantly, by, the, media, and, typically, when, reporting, on, larger, and, more, advanced, carrier, types, it, is, also, used, when, comparing, carriers, of, various, sizes, and, capabilities, both, current, and, past, it, was, first, used, by, the, new, york, times, in, 1938, in, an, article, about, the, royal, navy, s, hms, ark, royal, that, had, a, length, of, 800, feet, 244, m, a, displacement, of, 22, 000, ton, and, was, designed, to, carry, 72, aircraft, since, then, aircraft, carriers, have, consistently, grown, in, size, both, in, length, and, displacement, as, well, as, improved, capabilities, in, defense, sensors, electronic, warfare, propulsion, range, launch, and, recovery, systems, number, and, types, of, aircraft, carried, and, number, of, sorties, flown, per, day, china, and, the, united, kingdom, both, have, carriers, in, service, or, under, construction, with, displacements, ranging, from, 65, 000, to, 85, 000, tons, and, lengths, from, 280, to, 320, meters, 920, to, 1, 050, ft, which, have, been, described, as, supercarriers, the, largest, supercarriers, in, service, as, of, 2022, however, are, with, the, us, navy, with, displacements, exceeding, 100, 000, tons, lengths, of, over, 337, meters, 1, 106, ft, and, capabilities, that, match, or, exceed, those, of, any, other, class, several, systems, of, identification, symbol, for, aircraft, carriers, and, related, types, of, ship, have, been, used, these, include, the, pennant, numbers, used, by, the, royal, navy, commonwealth, countries, and, europe, along, with, the, hull, classification, symbols, used, by, the, us, and, canada, the, 1903, advent, of, the, heavier, than, air, fixed, wing, airplane, with, the, wright, brothers, first, flight, at, kitty, hawk, north, carolina, was, closely, followed, on, 14, november, 1910, by, eugene, burton, ely, s, first, experimental, take, off, of, a, curtiss, pusher, airplane, from, the, deck, of, a, united, states, navy, ship, the, cruiser, uss, birmingham, anchored, off, norfolk, navy, base, in, virginia, two, months, later, on, 18, january, 1911, ely, landed, his, curtiss, pusher, airplane, on, a, platform, on, the, armored, cruiser, uss, pennsylvania, anchored, in, san, francisco, bay, on, 9, may, 1912, the, first, take, off, of, an, airplane, from, a, ship, while, underway, was, made, by, commander, charles, samson, flying, a, short, improved, s, 27, biplane, s, 38, of, the, royal, naval, air, service, rnas, from, the, deck, of, the, royal, navy, s, pre, dreadnought, battleship, hms, hibernia, thus, providing, the, first, practical, demonstration, of, the, aircraft, carrier, for, naval, operations, at, sea, seaplane, tender, support, ships, came, next, with, the, french, foudre, of, 1911, early, in, world, war, i, the, imperial, japanese, navy, ship, wakamiya, conducted, the, world, s, first, successful, ship, launched, air, raid, on, 6, september, 1914, a, farman, aircraft, launched, by, wakamiya, attacked, the, austro, hungarian, cruiser, sms, kaiserin, elisabeth, and, the, imperial, german, gunboat, jaguar, in, jiaozhou, bay, off, qingdao, neither, was, hit, the, first, attack, using, an, air, launched, torpedo, occurred, on, 2, august, when, a, torpedo, was, fired, by, flight, commander, charles, edmonds, from, a, short, type, 184, seaplane, launched, from, the, seaplane, carrier, hms, ben, my, chree, the, first, carrier, launched, airstrike, was, the, tondern, raid, in, july, 1918, seven, sopwith, camels, were, launched, from, the, battlecruiser, hms, furious, which, had, been, completed, as, a, carrier, by, replacing, her, planned, forward, turret, with, a, flight, deck, and, hangar, prior, to, commissioning, the, camels, attacked, and, damaged, the, german, airbase, at, tondern, germany, modern, day, t, nder, denmark, and, destroyed, two, zeppelin, airships, the, first, landing, of, an, airplane, on, a, moving, ship, was, by, squadron, commander, edwin, harris, dunning, when, he, landed, his, sopwith, pup, on, hms, furious, in, scapa, flow, orkney, on, 2, august, 1917, landing, on, the, forward, flight, deck, required, the, pilot, to, approach, round, the, ship, s, superstructure, a, difficult, and, dangerous, manoeuver, and, dunning, was, later, killed, when, his, airplane, was, thrown, overboard, while, attempting, another, landing, on, furious, hms, furious, was, modified, again, when, her, rear, turret, was, removed, and, another, flight, deck, added, over, a, second, hangar, for, landing, aircraft, over, the, stern, her, funnel, and, superstructure, remained, intact, however, and, turbulence, from, the, funnel, and, superstructure, was, severe, enough, that, only, three, landing, attempts, were, successful, before, further, attempts, were, forbidden, this, experience, prompted, the, development, of, vessels, with, a, flush, deck, and, produced, the, first, large, fleet, ships, in, 1918, hms, argus, became, the, world, s, first, carrier, capable, of, launching, and, recovering, naval, aircraft, as, a, result, of, the, washington, naval, treaty, of, 1922, which, limited, the, construction, of, new, heavy, surface, combat, ships, most, early, aircraft, carriers, were, conversions, of, ships, that, were, laid, down, or, had, served, as, different, ship, types, cargo, ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or, battleships, these, conversions, gave, rise, to, the, uss, langley, in, 1922, the, us, lexington, class, aircraft, carriers, 1927, japanese, akagi, and, kaga, and, british, courageous, class, of, which, furious, was, one, specialist, carrier, evolution, was, well, underway, with, several, navies, ordering, and, building, warships, that, were, purposefully, designed, to, function, as, aircraft, carriers, by, the, mid, 1920s, this, resulted, in, the, commissioning, of, ships, such, as, the, japanese, h, sh, 1922, hms, hermes, 1924, although, laid, down, in, 1918, before, h, sh, and, b, arn, 1927, during, world, war, ii, these, ships, would, become, known, as, fleet, carriers, the, aircraft, carrier, dramatically, changed, naval, warfare, in, world, war, ii, because, air, power, was, becoming, a, significant, factor, in, warfare, the, advent, of, aircraft, as, focal, weapons, was, driven, by, the, superior, range, flexibility, and, effectiveness, of, carrier, launched, aircraft, they, had, greater, range, and, precision, than, naval, guns, making, them, highly, effective, the, versatility, of, the, carrier, was, demonstrated, in, november, 1940, when, hms, illustrious, launched, a, long, range, strike, on, the, italian, fleet, at, their, base, in, taranto, signalling, the, beginning, of, the, effective, and, highly, mobile, aircraft, strikes, this, operation, in, the, shallow, water, harbor, incapacitated, three, of, the, six, anchored, battleships, at, a, cost, of, two, torpedo, bombers, world, war, ii, in, the, pacific, ocean, involved, clashes, between, aircraft, carrier, fleets, the, japanese, surprise, attack, on, the, american, pacific, fleet, at, pearl, harbor, naval, and, air, bases, on, sunday, 7, december, 1941, was, a, clear, illustration, of, the, power, projection, capability, afforded, by, a, large, force, of, modern, carriers, concentrating, six, carriers, in, a, single, unit, turned, naval, history, about, as, no, other, nation, had, fielded, anything, comparable, in, the, doolittle, raid, on, 18, april, 1942, the, us, navy, carrier, uss, hornet, sailed, to, within, 650, nautical, miles, 1, 200, km, of, japan, and, launched, 16, b, 25, mitchell, medium, bombers, from, her, deck, in, a, demonstrative, retaliatory, strike, on, the, mainland, including, the, capital, tokyo, however, the, vulnerability, of, carriers, compared, to, traditional, capital, ships, was, illustrated, by, the, sinking, of, hms, glorious, by, german, battleships, during, the, norwegian, campaign, in, 1940, this, new, found, importance, of, naval, aviation, forced, nations, to, create, a, number, of, carriers, in, efforts, to, provide, air, superiority, cover, for, every, major, fleet, to, ward, off, enemy, aircraft, this, extensive, usage, led, to, the, development, and, construction, of, light, carriers, escort, aircraft, carriers, such, as, uss, bogue, were, sometimes, purpose, built, but, most, were, converted, from, merchant, ships, as, a, stop, gap, measure, to, provide, anti, submarine, air, support, for, convoys, and, amphibious, invasions, following, this, concept, light, aircraft, carriers, built, by, the, us, such, as, uss, independence, commissioned, in, 1943, represented, a, larger, more, militarized, version, of, the, escort, carrier, although, with, similar, complement, to, escort, carriers, they, had, the, advantage, of, speed, from, their, converted, cruiser, hulls, the, uk, 1942, design, light, fleet, carrier, was, designed, for, building, quickly, by, civilian, shipyards, and, with, an, expected, service, life, of, about, 3, years, they, served, the, royal, navy, during, the, war, and, the, hull, design, was, chosen, for, nearly, all, aircraft, carrier, equipped, navies, after, the, war, until, the, 1980s, emergencies, also, spurred, the, creation, or, conversion, of, highly, unconventional, aircraft, carriers, cam, ships, were, cargo, carrying, merchant, ships, that, could, launch, but, not, retrieve, a, single, fighter, aircraft, from, a, catapult, to, defend, the, convoy, from, long, range, land, based, german, aircraft, before, world, war, ii, international, naval, treaties, of, 1922, 1930, and, 1936, limited, the, size, of, capital, ships, including, carriers, since, world, war, ii, aircraft, carrier, designs, have, increased, in, size, to, accommodate, a, steady, increase, in, aircraft, size, the, large, modern, nimitz, class, of, us, navy, carriers, has, a, displacement, nearly, four, times, that, of, the, world, war, ii, era, uss, enterprise, yet, its, complement, of, aircraft, is, roughly, the, same, a, consequence, of, the, steadily, increasing, size, and, weight, of, individual, military, aircraft, over, the, years, today, s, aircraft, carriers, are, so, expensive, that, some, nations, which, operate, them, risk, significant, economic, and, military, impact, if, a, carrier, is, lost, some, changes, were, made, after, 1945, in, carriers, modern, navies, that, operate, such, aircraft, carriers, treat, them, as, capital, ships, of, fleets, a, role, previously, held, by, the, galleons, ships, of, the, line, and, battleships, this, change, took, place, during, world, war, ii, in, response, to, air, power, becoming, a, significant, factor, in, warfare, driven, by, the, superior, range, flexibility, and, effectiveness, of, carrier, launched, aircraft, following, the, war, carrier, operations, continued, to, increase, in, size, and, importance, and, along, with, carrier, designs, also, increased, in, size, and, ability, some, of, these, larger, carriers, dubbed, by, the, media, as, supercarriers, displacing, 75, 000, tons, or, greater, have, become, the, pinnacle, of, carrier, development, some, are, powered, by, nuclear, reactors, and, form, the, core, of, a, fleet, designed, to, operate, far, from, home, amphibious, assault, ships, such, as, the, wasp, and, mistral, classes, serve, the, purpose, of, carrying, and, landing, marines, and, operate, a, large, contingent, of, helicopters, for, that, purpose, also, known, as, commando, carriers, or, helicopter, carriers, many, have, the, capability, to, operate, vstol, aircraft, the, threatening, role, of, aircraft, carriers, has, a, place, in, modern, asymmetric, warfare, like, the, gunboat, diplomacy, of, the, past, carriers, also, facilitate, quick, and, precise, projections, of, overwhelming, military, power, into, such, local, and, regional, conflicts, lacking, the, firepower, of, other, warships, carriers, by, themselves, are, considered, vulnerable, to, attack, by, other, ships, aircraft, submarines, or, missiles, therefore, an, aircraft, carrier, is, generally, accompanied, by, a, number, of, other, ships, to, provide, protection, for, the, relatively, unwieldy, carrier, to, carry, supplies, re, supply, many, carriers, are, self, sufficient, and, will, supply, their, escorts, and, perform, other, support, services, and, to, provide, additional, offensive, capabilities, the, resulting, group, of, ships, is, often, termed, a, carrier, strike, group, battle, group, carrier, group, or, carrier, battle, group, there, is, a, view, among, some, military, pundits, that, modern, anti, ship, weapons, systems, such, as, torpedoes, and, missiles, or, even, ballistic, missiles, with, nuclear, warheads, have, made, aircraft, carriers, and, carrier, groups, too, vulnerable, for, modern, combat, carriers, can, also, be, vulnerable, to, diesel, electric, submarines, like, the, german, u24, of, the, conventional, 206, class, which, in, 2001, fired, at, the, enterprise, during, the, exercise, jtfex, 01, 2, in, the, caribbean, sea, by, firing, flares, and, taking, a, photograph, through, its, periscope, or, the, swedish, gotland, which, managed, the, same, feat, in, 2006, during, jtfex, 06, 2, by, penetrating, the, defensive, measures, of, carrier, strike, group, 7, which, was, protecting, uss, ronald, reagan, carriers, are, large, and, long, ships, although, there, is, a, high, degree, of, variation, depending, on, their, intended, role, and, aircraft, complement, the, size, of, the, carrier, has, varied, over, history, and, among, navies, to, cater, to, the, various, roles, that, global, climates, have, demanded, from, naval, aviation, regardless, of, size, the, ship, itself, must, house, their, complement, of, aircraft, with, space, for, launching, storing, and, maintaining, them, space, is, also, required, for, the, large, crew, supplies, food, munitions, fuel, engineering, parts, and, propulsion, us, aircraft, carriers, are, notable, for, having, nuclear, reactors, powering, their, systems, and, propulsion, the, top, of, the, carrier, is, the, flight, deck, where, aircraft, are, launched, and, recovered, on, the, starboard, side, of, this, is, the, island, where, the, funnel, air, traffic, control, and, the, bridge, are, located, the, constraints, of, constructing, a, flight, deck, affect, the, role, of, a, given, carrier, strongly, as, they, influence, the, weight, type, and, configuration, of, the, aircraft, that, may, be, launched, for, example, assisted, launch, mechanisms, are, used, primarily, for, heavy, aircraft, especially, those, loaded, with, air, to, ground, weapons, catobar, is, most, commonly, used, on, us, navy, fleet, carriers, as, it, allows, the, deployment, of, heavy, jets, with, full, load, outs, especially, on, ground, attack, missions, stovl, is, used, by, other, navies, because, it, is, cheaper, to, operate, and, still, provides, good, deployment, capability, for, fighter, aircraft, due, to, the, busy, nature, of, the, flight, deck, only, 20, or, so, aircraft, may, be, on, it, at, any, one, time, a, hangar, storage, several, decks, below, the, flight, deck, is, where, most, aircraft, are, kept, and, aircraft, are, taken, from, the, lower, storage, decks, to, the, flight, deck, through, the, use, of, an, elevator, the, hangar, is, usually, quite, large, and, can, take, up, several, decks, of, vertical, space, munitions, are, commonly, stored, on, the, lower, decks, because, they, are, highly, explosive, usually, this, is, below, the, waterline, so, that, the, area, can, be, flooded, in, case, of, emergency, as, runways, at, sea, aircraft, carriers, have, a, flat, top, flight, deck, which, launches, and, recovers, aircraft, aircraft, launch, forward, into, the, wind, and, are, recovered, from, astern, the, flight, deck, is, where, the, most, notable, differences, between, a, carrier, and, a, land, runway, are, found, creating, such, a, surface, at, sea, poses, constraints, on, the, carrier, for, example, the, size, of, the, vessel, is, a, fundamental, limitation, on, runway, length, this, affects, take, off, procedure, as, a, shorter, runway, length, of, the, deck, requires, that, aircraft, accelerate, more, quickly, to, gain, lift, this, either, requires, a, thrust, boost, a, vertical, component, to, its, velocity, or, a, reduced, take, off, load, to, lower, mass, the, differing, types, of, deck, configuration, as, above, influence, the, structure, of, the, flight, deck, the, form, of, launch, assistance, a, carrier, provides, is, strongly, related, to, the, types, of, aircraft, embarked, and, the, design, of, the, carrier, itself, there, are, two, main, philosophies, to, keep, the, deck, short, add, thrust, to, the, aircraft, such, as, using, a, catapult, assisted, take, off, cato, and, changing, the, direction, of, the, airplanes, thrust, as, in, vertical, and, or, short, take, off, v, sto, each, method, has, advantages, and, disadvantages, of, its, own, on, the, recovery, side, of, the, flight, deck, the, adaptation, to, the, aircraft, load, out, is, mirrored, non, vtol, or, conventional, aircraft, cannot, decelerate, on, their, own, and, almost, all, carriers, using, them, must, have, arrested, recovery, systems, bar, e, g, catobar, or, stobar, to, recover, their, aircraft, aircraft, that, are, landing, extend, a, tailhook, that, catches, on, arrestor, wires, stretched, across, the, deck, to, bring, themselves, to, a, stop, in, a, short, distance, post, world, war, ii, royal, navy, research, on, safer, catobar, recovery, eventually, led, to, universal, adoption, of, a, landing, area, angled, off, axis, to, allow, aircraft, who, missed, the, arresting, wires, to, bolt, and, safely, return, to, flight, for, another, landing, attempt, rather, than, crashing, into, aircraft, on, the, forward, deck, if, the, aircraft, are, vtol, capable, or, helicopters, they, do, not, need, to, decelerate, and, hence, there, is, no, such, need, the, arrested, recovery, system, has, used, an, angled, deck, since, the, 1950s, because, in, case, the, aircraft, does, not, catch, the, arresting, wire, the, short, deck, allows, easier, take, off, by, reducing, the, number, of, objects, between, the, aircraft, and, the, end, of, the, runway, it, also, has, the, advantage, of, separating, the, recovery, operation, area, from, the, launch, area, helicopters, and, aircraft, capable, of, vertical, or, short, take, off, and, landing, v, stol, usually, recover, by, coming, abreast, of, the, carrier, on, the, port, side, and, then, using, their, hover, capability, to, move, over, the, flight, deck, and, land, vertically, without, the, need, for, arresting, gear, carriers, steam, at, speed, up, to, 35, knots, 65, km, h, 40, mph, into, the, wind, during, flight, deck, operations, to, increase, wind, speed, over, the, deck, to, a, safe, minimum, this, increase, in, effective, wind, speed, provides, a, higher, launch, airspeed, for, aircraft, at, the, end, of, the, catapult, stroke, or, ski, jump, as, well, as, making, recovery, safer, by, reducing, the, difference, between, the, relative, speeds, of, the, aircraft, and, ship, since, the, early, 1950s, on, conventional, carriers, it, has, been, the, practice, to, recover, aircraft, at, an, angle, to, port, of, the, axial, line, of, the, ship, the, primary, function, of, this, angled, deck, is, to, allow, aircraft, that, miss, the, arresting, wires, referred, to, as, a, bolter, to, become, airborne, again, without, the, risk, of, hitting, aircraft, parked, forward, the, angled, deck, allows, the, installation, of, one, or, two, waist, catapults, in, addition, to, the, two, bow, cats, an, angled, deck, also, improves, launch, and, recovery, cycle, flexibility, with, the, option, of, simultaneous, launching, and, recovery, of, aircraft, conventional, tailhook, aircraft, rely, upon, a, landing, signal, officer, lso, radio, call, sign, paddles, to, monitor, the, aircraft, s, approach, visually, gauge, glideslope, attitude, and, airspeed, and, transmit, that, data, to, the, pilot, before, the, angled, deck, emerged, in, the, 1950s, lsos, used, colored, paddles, to, signal, corrections, to, the, pilot, hence, the, nickname, from, the, late, 1950s, onward, visual, landing, aids, such, as, the, optical, landing, system, have, provided, information, on, proper, glide, slope, but, lsos, still, transmit, voice, calls, to, approaching, pilots, by, radio, key, personnel, involved, in, the, flight, deck, include, the, shooters, the, handler, and, the, air, boss, shooters, are, naval, aviators, or, naval, flight, officers, and, are, responsible, for, launching, aircraft, the, handler, works, just, inside, the, island, from, the, flight, deck, and, is, responsible, for, the, movement, of, aircraft, before, launching, and, after, recovery, the, air, boss, usually, a, commander, occupies, the, top, bridge, primary, flight, control, also, called, primary, or, the, tower, and, has, the, overall, responsibility, for, controlling, launch, recovery, and, those, aircraft, in, the, air, near, the, ship, and, the, movement, of, planes, on, the, flight, deck, which, itself, resembles, a, well, choreographed, ballet, the, captain, of, the, ship, spends, most, of, his, time, one, level, below, primary, on, the, navigation, bridge, below, this, is, the, flag, bridge, designated, for, the, embarked, admiral, and, his, staff, to, facilitate, working, on, the, flight, deck, of, a, us, aircraft, carrier, the, sailors, wear, colored, shirts, that, designate, their, responsibilities, there, are, at, least, seven, different, colors, worn, by, flight, deck, personnel, for, modern, united, states, navy, carrier, air, operations, carrier, operations, of, other, nations, use, similar, color, schemes, the, superstructure, of, a, carrier, such, as, the, bridge, flight, control, tower, are, concentrated, in, a, relatively, small, area, called, an, island, a, feature, pioneered, on, hms, hermes, in, 1923, while, the, island, is, usually, built, on, the, starboard, side, of, the, flight, deck, the, japanese, aircraft, carriers, akagi, and, hiry, had, their, islands, built, on, the, port, side, very, few, carriers, have, been, designed, or, built, without, an, island, the, flush, deck, configuration, proved, to, have, significant, drawbacks, primary, of, which, was, management, of, the, exhaust, from, the, power, plant, fumes, coming, across, the, deck, were, a, major, issue, in, uss, langley, in, addition, lack, of, an, island, meant, difficulties, managing, the, flight, deck, performing, air, traffic, control, a, lack, of, radar, housing, placements, and, problems, with, navigating, and, controlling, the, ship, itself, another, deck, structure, that, can, be, seen, is, a, ski, jump, ramp, at, the, forward, end, of, the, flight, deck, this, was, first, developed, to, help, launch, short, take, off, vertical, landing, stovl, aircraft, take, off, at, far, higher, weights, than, is, possible, with, a, vertical, or, rolling, takeoff, on, flat, decks, originally, developed, by, the, royal, navy, it, since, has, been, adopted, by, many, navies, for, smaller, carriers, a, ski, jump, ramp, works, by, converting, some, of, the, forward, rolling, movement, of, the, aircraft, into, vertical, velocity, and, is, sometimes, combined, with, the, aiming, of, jet, thrust, partly, downward, this, allows, heavily, loaded, and, fueled, aircraft, a, few, more, precious, seconds, to, attain, sufficient, air, velocity, and, lift, to, sustain, normal, flight, without, a, ski, jump, launching, fully, loaded, and, fueled, aircraft, such, as, the, harrier, would, not, be, possible, on, a, smaller, flat, deck, ship, before, either, stalling, out, or, crashing, directly, into, the, sea, although, stovl, aircraft, are, capable, of, taking, off, vertically, from, a, spot, on, the, deck, using, the, ramp, and, a, running, start, is, far, more, fuel, efficient, and, permits, a, heavier, launch, weight, as, catapults, are, unnecessary, carriers, with, this, arrangement, reduce, weight, complexity, and, space, needed, for, complex, steam, or, electromagnetic, launching, equipment, vertical, landing, aircraft, also, remove, the, need, for, arresting, cables, and, related, hardware, russian, chinese, and, indian, carriers, include, a, ski, jump, ramp, for, launching, lightly, loaded, conventional, fighter, aircraft, but, recover, using, traditional, carrier, arresting, cables, and, a, tailhook, on, their, aircraft, the, disadvantage, of, the, ski, jump, is, the, penalty, it, exacts, on, aircraft, size, payload, and, fuel, load, and, thus, range, heavily, laden, aircraft, cannot, launch, using, a, ski, jump, because, their, high, loaded, weight, requires, either, a, longer, takeoff, roll, than, is, possible, on, a, carrier, deck, or, assistance, from, a, catapult, or, jato, rocket, for, example, the, russian, sukhoi, su, 33, is, only, able, to, launch, from, the, carrier, admiral, kuznetsov, with, a, minimal, armament, and, fuel, load, another, disadvantage, is, on, mixed, flight, deck, operations, where, helicopters, are, also, present, such, as, on, a, us, landing, helicopter, dock, or, landing, helicopter, assault, amphibious, assault, ship, a, ski, jump, is, not, included, as, this, would, eliminate, one, or, more, helicopter, landing, areas, this, flat, deck, limits, the, loading, of, harriers, but, is, somewhat, mitigated, by, the, longer, rolling, start, provided, by, a, long, flight, deck, compared, to, many, stovl, carriers, the, us, navy, has, the, largest, fleet, of, carriers, in, the, world, with, eleven, supercarriers, currently, in, service, china, and, india, each, have, two, stobar, carriers, in, service,
