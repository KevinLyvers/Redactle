and, a, wide, range, of, unique, quilting, styles, and, techniques, have, evolved, around, the, globe, the, earliest, known, quilted, garment, is, depicted, on, the, carved, ivory, figure, of, a, pharaoh, dating, from, the, ancient, egyptian, first, dynasty, in, 1924, archaeologists, discovered, a, quilted, floor, covering, in, mongolia, estimated, to, date, between, 100, bc, and, 200, ad, in, europe, quilting, has, been, part, of, the, needlework, tradition, since, about, the, fifth, century, early, objects, contained, egyptian, cotton, which, may, indicate, that, egyptian, and, mediterranean, trade, provided, a, conduit, for, the, technique, however, quilted, objects, were, relatively, rare, in, europe, until, approximately, the, twelfth, century, when, quilted, bedding, and, other, items, appeared, after, the, return, of, the, crusaders, from, the, middle, east, the, medieval, quilted, gambeson, aketon, and, arming, doublet, were, garments, worn, under, or, instead,

worn, out, blankets, were, utilized, to, create, a, new, quilt, from, worn, out, clothes, and, in, these, quilts, the, internal, batting, layer, was, made, up, of, old, blankets, or, older, quilts, during, american, pioneer, days, foundation, piecing, became, popular, paper, was, cut, into, shapes, and, used, as, a, pattern, each, individual, piece, of, cut, fabric, was, basted, around, the, paper, pattern, paper, was, a, scarce, commodity, in, the, early, american, west, so, women, would, save, letters, from, home, postcards, newspaper, clippings, and, catalogs, to, use, as, patterns, the, paper, not, only, served, as, a, pattern, but, as, an, insulator, paper, found, between, these, old, quilts, has, become, a, primary, source, of, information, about, pioneer, life, quilts, made, without, any, insulation, or, batting, were, referred, to, as, summer, quilts, they, were, not, made, for, warmth, but, to, keep, the, chill, off, during, cooler, summer, evenings, there, is, a, long, tradition, of, african, american, quilting, beginning, with, quilts, made, by, enslaved, africans, both, for, themselves, and, for, the, people, who, enslaved, them, the, style, of, these, quilts, was, determined, largely, by, time, period, and, region, rather, than, race, and, the, documented, slave, made, quilts, generally, resemble, those, made, by, white, women, in, their, region, after, 1865, and, the, end, of, slavery, in, the, united, states, african, americans, began, to, develop, their, own, distinctive, style, of, quilting, harriet, powers, an, african, american, woman, born, into, slavery, made, two, famous, story, quilts, and, was, one, of, the, many, african, american, quilters, who, contributed, to, the, development, of, quilting, in, the, united, states, this, style, of, african, american, quilts, was, categorized, by, its, bright, colors, organization, in, a, strip, arrangement, and, asymmetrical, patterns, the, first, nationwide, recognition, of, african, american, quilt, making, came, when, the, gee, s, bend, quilting, community, of, alabama, was, celebrated, in, an, exhibition, that, opened, in, 2002, and, traveled, to, many, museums, including, the, smithsonian, gee, s, bend, is, a, small, isolated, community, of, african, americans, in, southern, alabama, with, a, quilt, making, tradition, that, goes, back, several, generations, and, is, characterized, by, pattern, improvisation, multiple, patterning, bright, and, contrasting, colors, visual, motion, and, a, lack, of, rules, the, contributions, made, by, harriet, powers, and, other, quilters, of, gee, s, bend, alabama, have, been, recognized, by, the, us, postal, service, with, a, series, of, stamps, many, of, the, quilters, of, gee, s, bend, also, participated, in, the, freedom, quilting, bee, a, quilting, co, op, created, by, some, of, the, african, american, women, of, wilcox, county, alabama, some, of, the, founding, and, influential, members, include, estelle,

travel, the, underground, railroad, consensus, among, historians, is, that, there, is, no, sound, basis, for, this, belief, and, no, documented, mention, among, the, thousands, of, slave, narratives, or, other, contemporary, records, contemporary, quilters, such, as, faith, ringgold, utilize, quilt, making, to, tell, stories, and, make, political, statements, about, the, african, american, experience, ringgold, originally, a, painter, began, quilting, in, order, to, stray, away, from, western, art, practices, her, famous, story, quilts, utilize, mixed, media, painting, and, quilting,

to, develop, a, distinct, style, of, quilting, were, the, amish, typically, these, quilts, use, only, solid, fabrics, are, pieced, from, geometric, shapes, do, not, contain, appliqu, and, construction, is, simple, corners, are, butted, rather, than, mitered, for, instance, and, done, entirely, by, hand, amish, quilters, also, tend, to, use, simple, patterns, lancaster, county, amish, are, known, for, their, diamond, in, a, square, and, bars, patterns, while, other, communities, use, patterns, such, as, brick, streak, of, lightning, chinese, coins, and, log, cabins, and, midwestern, communities, are, known, for, their, repeating, block, patterns, borders, and, color, choice, also, vary, by, community, for, example, lancaster, quilts, feature, wide, borders, with, lavish, quilting, midwestern, quilts, feature, narrower, borders, to, balance, the, fancier, piecing, some, native, americans, are, thought, to, have, learned, quilting, through, observation, of, white, settlers, others, learned, it, from, missionaries, who, taught, quilting, to, native, american, women, along, with, other, homemaking, skills, native, american, women, quickly, developed, their, own, unique, style, the, lone, star, design, also, called, the, star, of, bethlehem, a, variation, on, morning, star, designs, that, had, been, featured, on, native, american, clothing, and, other, items, for, centuries, these, quilts, often, featured, floral, appliqu, framing, the, star, design, star, quilts, have, become, an, important, part, of, many, plains, indian, ceremonies, replacing, buffalo, robes, traditionally, given, away, at, births, marriages, tribal, elections, and, other, ceremonies, pictorial, quilts, created, with, appliqu, were, also, common, another, distinctive, style, of, native, american, quilting, is, seminole, piecing, created, by, seminoles, living, in, the, florida, everglades, the, style, evolved, out, of, a, need, for, cloth, the, closest, town, was, often, a, week, s, journey, away, women, would, make, strips, of, sewing, the, remnants, of, fabric, rolls, together, then, sew, these, into, larger, pieces, to, make, clothing, eventually, the, style, began, to, be, used, not, just, for, clothing, but, for, quilts, as, well, in, 1900, with, the, introduction, of, sewing, machines, and, readily, available, fabric, in, seminole, communities, the, patterns, became, much, more, elaborate, and, the, style, continues, to, be, in, use, today, both, by, seminole, women, and, by, others, who, have, copied, and, adapted, their, designs, and, techniques, hawaiian, quilting, was, well, established, by, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, hawaiian, women, learned, to, quilt, from, the, wives, of, missionaries, from, new, england, in, the, 1820s, though, they, learned, both, pieced, work, and, applique, by, the, 1870s, they, had, adapted, applique, techniques, to, create, a, uniquely, hawaiian, mode, of, expression, the, classic, hawaiian, quilt, design, is, a, large, bold, curvilinear, appliqu, pattern, that, covers, much, of, the, surface, of, the, quilt, with, the, symmetrical, design, cut, from, only, one, piece, of, fabric, there, are, two, primary, forms, of, quilting, that, originate, in, south, asia, nakshi, kantha, and, ralli, nakshi, kantha, quilts, originated, in, india, and, are, typically, made, of, scraps, and, worn, out, fabric, stitched, together, with, old, sari, threads, using, kantha, embroidery, stitches, the, layers, of, cloth, were, spread, on, the, ground, held, in, place, with, weights, at, the, edges, and, sewn, together, with, rows, of, large, basting, stitches, the, cloth, was, then, folded, and, worked, on, whenever, there, was, time, the, first, recorded, kantha, are, more, than, 500, years, old, ralli, quilts, are, traditionally, made, in, pakistan, western, india, and, the, surrounding, area, they, are, made, by, every, sector, of, society, including, hindu, and, muslim, women, women, of, different, castes, and, women, from, different, towns, or, villages, or, tribes, with, the, colors, and, designs, varying, among, these, groups, the, name, comes, from, ralanna, a, word, meaning, to, mix, or, connect, quilts, tops, were, designed, and, pieced, by, one, woman, using, scraps, of, hand, dyed, cotton, this, cotton, often, comes, from, old, dresses, or, shawls, once, pieced, the, quilt, top, is, placed, on, a, reed, mat, with, the, other, layers, and, sewn, together, using, thick, colored, thread, in, straight, parallel, lines, by, members, of, the, designer, s, family, and, community, quilting, in, japan, until, the, 20th, century, generally, covered, local, bast, fibers, with, more, valuable, cotton, cloth, the, rectangular, nature, of, japanese, cloth, articles, encouraged, rectangle, based, patterns, sashiko, stitching, has, now, also, developed, purely, decorative, forms, quilting, originated, in, sweden, in, the, fifteenth, century, with, heavily, stitched, and, appliqu, d, quilts, made, for, the, very, wealthy, these, quilts, created, from, silk, wool, and, felt, were, intended, to, be, both, decorative, and, functional, and, were, found, in, churches, and, in, the, homes, of, nobility, imported, cotton, first, appeared, in, sweden, in, 1870, and, began, to, appear, in, swedish, quilts, soon, after, along, with, scraps, of, wool, silk, and, linen, as, the, availability, of, cotton, increased, and, its, price, went, down, quilting, became, widespread, among, all, classes, of, swedish, society, wealthier, quilters, used, wool, batting, while, others, used, linen, scraps, rags, or, paper, mixed, with, animal, hair, in, general, these, quilts, were, simple, and, narrow, made, by, both, men, and, women, the, biggest, influence, on, swedish, quilting, in, this, time, period, is, thought, to, have, come, from, america, as, swedish, immigrants, to, the, united, states, returned, to, their, home, country, when, conditions, there, improved, during, the, late, 20th, century, art, quilts, became, popular, for, their, aesthetic, and, artistic, qualities, rather, than, for, functionality, these, quilts, may, be, displayed, on, a, wall, or, table, instead, of, being, used, on, a, bed, it, is, believed, that, decorative, quilting, came, to, europe, and, asia, during, the, crusades, a, d, 1100, 1300, a, likely, idea, because, textile, arts, were, more, developed, in, china, and, india, than, in, the, west, american, artist, judy, chicago, stated, in, a, 1981, interview, that, were, it, not, for, sexism, in, the, visual, arts, the, art, world, and, broader, society, quilting, would, be, more, widely, regarded, as, a, form, of, high, art, abstract, patterns, by, men, are, art, abstract, patterns, by, women, in, fabric, are, decorative, they, re, called, quilts, so, there, s, all, these, kind, of, double, standards, and, all, these, kind, of, words, that, prevent, women, s, experience, from, entering, even, when, they, express, it, from, entering, the, mainstream, of, art, in, the, early, 21st, century, modern, quilting, became, a, more, prominent, area, of, quilting, modern, quilting, follows, a, distinct, aesthetic, style, which, draws, on, inspiration, from, modern, style, in, architecture, art, and, design, using, traditional, quilt, making, techniques, modern, quilts, are, different, from, art, quilts, in, that, they, are, made, to, be, used, modern, quilts, are, also, influenced, by, the, quilters, of, gee, s, bend, amish, quilts, nancy, crow, denyse, schmidt, gwen, marston, yoshiko, jinzenji, bill, kerr, and, weeks, ringle, the, modern, quilt, guild, has, attempted, to, define, modern, quilting, the, characteristics, of, a, modern, quilt, may, include, the, use, of, bold, colors, and, prints, high, contrast, and, graphic, areas, of, solid, color, improvisational, piecing, minimalism, expansive, negative, space, and, alternate, grid, work,

21st, century, the, quilt, block, is, traditionally, a, sub, unit, composed, of, several, pieces, of, fabric, sewn, together, the, quilt, blocks, are, repeated, or, sometimes, alternated, with, plain, blocks, to, form, the, overall, design, of, a, quilt, barbara, brackman, has, documented, over, 4000, different, quilt, block, patterns, from, the, early, 1830s, to, the, 1970s, in, the, encyclopedia, of, pieced, quilt, patterns, some, of, the, simpler, designs, for, quilt, blocks, include, the, nine, patch, shoo, fly, churn, dash, and, the, prairie, queen, most, geometric, quilt, block, designs, fit, into, a, grid, which, is, the, number, of, squares, a, pattern, block, is, divided, into, the, five, categories, into, which, most, square, patterns, fall, are, four, patch, nine, patch, five, patch, seven, patch, and, eight, pointed, star, each, block, can, be, subdivided, into, multiples, a, four, patch, can, be, constructed, of, 16, or, 64, squares, for, example, a, simple, nine, patch, is, made, by, sewing, five, patterned, or, dark, pieces, patches, to, four, light, square, pieces, in, alternating, order, these, nine, sewn, squares, make, one, block, the, shoo, fly, varies, from, this, nine, patch, by, dividing, each, of, the, four, corner, pieces, into, a, light, and, dark, triangle, another, variation, develops, when, one, square, piece, is, divided, into, two, equal, rectangles, in, the, basic, nine, patch, design, the, churn, dash, block, combines, the, triangles, and, rectangle, to, expand, the, nine, patch, the, prairie, queen, block, combines, two, large, scale, triangles, in, the, corner, section, with, the, middle, section, using, four, squares, the, center, piece, is, one, full, size, square, each, of, the, nine, sections, does, have, the, same, overall, measurement, and, fits, together, the, number, of, patterns, possible, by, subdividing, four, five, seven, nine, patches, and, eight, pointed, stars, and, using, triangles, instead, of, squares, in, the, small, subdivisions, is, almost, endless, many, types, of, quilting, exist, today, the, two, most, widely, used, are, hand, quilting, and, machine, quilting, hand, quilting, is, the, process, of, using, a, needle, and, thread, to, sew, a, running, stitch, by, hand, across, the, entire, area, to, be, quilted, this, binds, the, layers, together, a, quilting, frame, or, hoop, is, often, used, to, assist, in, holding, the, piece, being, quilted, off, the, quilter, s, lap, a, quilter, can, make, one, stitch, at, a, time, by, first, driving, the, needle, through, the, fabric, from, the, right, side, then, pushing, it, back, up, through, the, material, from, the, wrong, side, to, complete, the, stitch, this, is, called, a, stab, stitch, another, option, is, called, a, rocking, stitch, where, the, quilter, has, one, hand, usually, with, a, finger, wearing, a, thimble, on, top, of, the, quilt, while, the, other, hand, is, located, beneath, the, piece, to, push, the, needle, back, up, a, third, option, is, called, loading, the, needle, and, involves, doing, four, or, more, stitches, before, pulling, the, needle, through, the, cloth, hand, quilting, is, still, practiced, by, the, amish, and, mennonites, within, the, united, states, and, canada, and, is, enjoying, a, resurgence, worldwide, machine, quilting, is, the, process, of, using, a, home, sewing, machine, or, a, longarm, machine, to, sew, the, layers, together, with, the, home, sewing, machine, the, layers, are, tacked, together, before, quilting, this, involves, laying, the, top, batting, and, backing, out, on, a, flat, surface, and, either, pinning, using, large, safety, pins, or, tacking, the, layers, together, longarm, quilting, involves, placing, the, layers, to, be, quilted, on, a, special, frame, the, frame, has, bars, on, which, the, layers, are, rolled, keeping, these, together, without, the, need, for, tacking, or, pinning, these, frames, are, used, with, a, professional, sewing, machine, mounted, on, a, platform, the, platform, rides, along, tracks, so, that, the, machine, can, be, moved, across, the, layers, on, the, frame, a, longarm, machine, is, moved, across, the, fabric, in, contrast, the, fabric, is, moved, through, a, home, sewing, machine, tying, is, another, technique, of, fastening, the, three, layers, together, this, is, done, primarily, on, quilts, that, are, made, to, be, used, and, are, needed, quickly, the, process, of, tying, the, quilt, is, done, with, yarns, or, multiple, strands, of, thread, square, knots, are, used, to, finish, off, the, ties, so, that, the, quilt, may, be, washed, and, used, without, fear, of, the, knots, coming, undone, this, technique, is, commonly, called, tacking, in, the, midwest, tacked, bed, covers, are, referred, to, as, comforters, quilting, is, now, taught, in, some, american, schools, it, is, also, taught, at, senior, centers, around, the, u, s, but, quilters, of, all, ages, attend, classes, these, forms, of, workshops, or, classes, are, also, available, in, other, countries, in, guilds, and, community, colleges, contemporary, quilters, use, a, wide, range, of, quilting, designs, and, styles, from, ancient, and, ethnic, to, post, modern, futuristic, patterns, there, is, no, one, single, school, or, style, that, dominates, the, quilt, making, world, sewing, machines, can, be, used, in, the, process, of, piecing, together, a, quilt, top, some, quilters, also, use, a, home, sewing, machine, for, quilting, together, the, layers, of, the, quilt, as, well, as, binding, the, final, product, while, most, home, sewing, machines, can, be, used, to, quilt, layers, together, having, a, wide, throat, the, space, to, the, right, of, the, needle, mechanism, is, useful, to, manipulate, a, bulky, quilt, through, the, machine, when, the, throat, is, both, high, and, long, fabric, markers, can, be, used, to, mark, where, cuts, should, be, made, in, the, fabric, marks, from, specialist, fabric, marker, wash, out, of, fabrics, quilting, rulers, are, usually, square, or, rectangular, measuring, instruments, with, length, measurement, and, degree, angle, markings, along, multiple, edges, longarm, quilting, machines, can, be, used, to, make, larger, quilts, larger, machines, can, be, leveraged, so, that, the, quilter, does, not, have, to, hold, the, fabric, some, specialist, quilt, shops, offer, longarm, services, machine, quilting, needles, are, very, sharp, in, order, to, readily, pierce, layers, of, quilt, and, properly, sew, together, the, quilt, top, batting, and, backing, hand, quilting, needles, are, traditionally, called, betweens, and, are, generally, smaller, and, stronger, than, normal, sewing, needles, they, have, a, very, small, eye, which, prevents, any, extra, bump, at, the, head, of, the, needles, when, you, are, pulling, through, the, thread, pins, can, be, used, in, many, different, combinations, to, achieve, similar, results, thimbles, provide, protection, to, fingertips, specialist, quilting, threads, come, in, many, types, including, different, weights, of, thread, and, different, materials, cotton, polyester, and, nylon, threads, are, used, in, different, forms, of, quilting, rotary, cutters, revolutionized, quilt, making, when, they, appeared, in, the, late, 1970s, rotary, cutters, simplify, the, process, of, cutting, even, slices, of, fabric, basting, spray, is, a, temporary, aerosol, glue, that, can, be, used, to, spray, the, layers, of, a, quilt, together, so, it, stays, in, place, whilst, being, sewn, it, is, a,
