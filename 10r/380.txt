a, photometer, is, an, instrument, that, measures, the, strength, of, electromagnetic, radiation, in, the, range, from, ultraviolet, to, infrared, and, including, the, visible, spectrum, most, photometers, convert, light, into, an, electric, current, using, a, photoresistor, photodiode, or, photomultiplier, photometers, measure, historically, photometry, was, done, by, estimation, comparing, the, luminous, flux, of, a, source, with, a, standard, source, by, the, 19th, century, common, photometers, included, rumford, s, photometer, which, compared, the, depths, of, shadows, cast, by, different, light, sources, and, ritchie, s, photometer, which, relied, on, equal, illumination, of, surfaces, another, type, was, based, on, the, extinction, of, shadows, modern, photometers, utilize, photoresistors, photodiodes, or, photomultipliers, to, detect, light, some, models, employ, photon, counting, measuring, light, by, counting, individual, photons, they, are, especially, useful, in, areas, where, the, irradiance, is, low, photometers, have, wide, ranging, applications, including, photography, where, they, determine, the, correct, exposure, and, science, where, they, are, used, in, absorption, spectroscopy, to, calculate, the, concentration, of, substances, in, a, solution, infrared, spectroscopy, to, study, the, structure, of, substances, and, atomic, absorption, spectroscopy, to, determine, the, concentration, of, metals, in, a, solution, before, electronic, light, sensitive, elements, were, developed, photometry, was, done, by, estimation, by, the, eye, the, relative, luminous, flux, of, a, source, was, compared, with, a, standard, source, the, photometer, is, placed, such, that, the, illuminance, from, the, source, being, investigated, is, equal, to, the, standard, source, as, the, human, eye, can, judge, equal, illuminance, the, relative, luminous, fluxes, can, then, be, calculated, as, the, illuminance, decreases, proportionally, to, the, inverse, square, of, distance, a, standard, example, of, such, a, photometer, consists, of, a, piece, of, paper, with, an, oil, spot, on, it, that, makes, the, paper, slightly, more, transparent, when, the, spot, is, not, visible, from, either, side, the, illuminance, from, the, two, sides, is, equal, by, 1861, three, types, were, in, common, use, these, were, rumford, s, photometer, ritchie, s, photometer, and, photometers, that, used, the, extinction, of, shadows, which, was, considered, to, be, the, most, precise, rumford, s, photometer, also, called, a, shadow, photometer, depended, on, the, principle, that, a, brighter, light, would, cast, a, deeper, shadow, the, two, lights, to, be, compared, were, used, to, cast, a, shadow, onto, paper, if, the, shadows, were, of, the, same, depth, the, difference, in, distance, of, the, lights, would, indicate, the, difference, in, intensity, e, g, a, light, twice, as, far, would, be, four, times, the, intensity, ritchie, s, photometer, depends, upon, equal, illumination, of, surfaces, it, consists, of, a, box, a, b, six, or, eight, inches, long, and, one, in, width, and, depth, in, the, middle, a, wedge, of, wood, f, e, g, was, angled, upwards, and, covered, with, white, paper, the, user, s, eye, looked, through, a, tube, d, at, the, top, of, a, box, the, height, of, the, apparatus, was, also, adjustable, via, the, stand, c, the, lights, to, compare, were, placed, at, the, side, of, the, box, m, n, which, illuminated, the, paper, surfaces, so, that, the, eye, saw, both, surfaces, at, once, by, changing, the, position, of, the, lights, they, were, made, to, illuminate, both, surfaces, equally, with, the, difference, in, intensity, corresponding, to, the, square, of, the, difference, in, distance, this, type, of, photometer, depended, on, the, fact, that, if, a, light, throws, the, shadow, of, an, opaque, object, onto, a, white, screen, there, is, a, certain, distance, that, if, a, second, light, is, brought, there, obliterates, all, traces, of, the, shadow, most, photometers, detect, the, light, with, photoresistors, photodiodes, or, photomultipliers, to, analyze, the, light, the, photometer, may, measure, the, light, after, it, has, passed, through, a, filter, or, through, a, monochromator, for, determination, at, defined, wavelengths, or, for, analysis, of, the, spectral, distribution, of, the, light, some, photometers, measure, light, by, counting, individual, photons, rather, than, incoming, flux, the, operating, principles, are, the, same, but, the, results, are, given, in, units, such, as, photons, cm, 2, or, photons, cm, 2, sr, 1, rather, than, w, cm, 2, or, w, cm, 2, sr, 1, due, to, their, individual, photon, counting, nature, these, instruments, are, limited, to, observations, where, the, irradiance, is, low, the, irradiance, is, limited, by, the, time, resolution, of, its, associated, detector, readout, electronics, with, current, technology, this, is, in, the, megahertz, range, the, maximum, irradiance, is, also, limited, by, the, throughput, and, gain, parameters, of, the, detector, itself, the, light, sensing, element, in, photon, counting, devices, in, nir, visible, and, ultraviolet, wavelengths, is, a, photomultiplier, to, achieve, sufficient, sensitivity, in, airborne, and, space, based, remote, sensing, such, photon, counters, are, used, at, the, upper, reaches, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, such, as, the, x, ray, to, far, ultraviolet, this, is, usually, due, to, the, lower, radiant, intensity, of, the, objects, being, measured, as, well, as, the, difficulty, of, measuring, light, at, higher, energies, using, its, particle, like, nature, as, compared, to, the, wavelike, nature, of, light, at, lower, frequencies, conversely, radiometers, are, typically, used, for, remote, sensing, from, the, visible, infrared, though, radio, frequency, range, photometers, are, used, to, determine, the, correct, exposure, in, photography, in, modern, cameras, the, photometer, is, usually, built, in, as, the, illumination, of, different, parts, of, the, picture, varies, advanced, photometers, measure, the, light, intensity, in, different, parts, of, the, potential, picture, and, use, an, algorithm, to, determine, the, most, suitable, exposure, for, the, final, picture, adapting, the, algorithm, to, the, type, of, picture, intended, see, metering, mode, historically, a, photometer, was, separate, from, the, camera, and, known, as, an, exposure, meter, the, advanced, photometers, then, could, be, used, either, to, measure, the, light, from, the, potential, picture, as, a, whole, to, measure, from, elements, of, the, picture, to, ascertain, that, the, most, important, parts, of, the, picture, are, optimally, exposed, or, to, measure, the, incident, light, to, the, scene, with, an, integrating, adapter, a, reflectance, photometer, measures, the, reflectance, of, a, surface, as, a, function, of, wavelength, the, surface, is, illuminated, with, white, light, and, the, reflected, light, is, measured, after, passing, through, a, monochromator, this, type, of, measurement, has, mainly, practical, applications, for, instance, in, the, paint, industry, to, characterize, the, colour, of, a, surface, objectively, these, are, optical, instruments, for, measurement, of, the, absorption, of, light, of, a, given, wavelength, or, a, given, range, of, wavelengths, of, coloured, substances, in, solution, from, the, light, absorption, beer, s, law, makes, it, possible, to, calculate, the, concentration, of, the, coloured, substance, in, the, solution, due, to, its, wide, range, of, application, and, its, reliability, and, robustness, the, photometer, has, become, one, of, the, principal, instruments, in, biochemistry, and, analytical, chemistry, absorption, photometers, for, work, in, aqueous, solution, work, in, the, ultraviolet, and, visible, ranges, from, wavelength, around, 240, nm, up, to, 750, nm, the, principle, of, spectrophotometers, and, filter, photometers, is, that, as, far, as, possible, monochromatic, light, is, allowed, to, pass, through, a, container, cell, with, optically, flat, windows, containing, the, solution, it, then, reaches, a, light, detector, that, measures, the, intensity, of, the, light, compared, to, the, intensity, after, passing, through, an, identical, cell, with, the, same, solvent, but, without, the, coloured, substance, from, the, ratio, between, the, light, intensities, knowing, the, capacity, of, the, coloured, substance, to, absorb, light, the, absorbency, of, the, coloured, substance, or, the, photon, cross, section, area, of, the, molecules, of, the, coloured, substance, at, a, given, wavelength, it, is, possible, to, calculate, the, concentration, of, the, substance, using, beer, s, law, two, types, of, photometers, are, used, spectrophotometer, and, filter, photometer, in, spectrophotometers, a, monochromator, with, prism, or, with, grating, is, used, to, obtain, monochromatic, light, of, one, defined, wavelength, in, filter, photometers, optical, filters, are, used, to, give, the, monochromatic, light, spectrophotometers, can, thus, easily, be, set, to, measure, the, absorbance, at, different, wavelengths, and, they, can, also, be, used, to, scan, the, spectrum, of, the, absorbing, substance, they, are, in, this, way, more, flexible, than, filter, photometers, also, give, a, higher, optical, purity, of, the, analyzing, light, and, therefore, they, are, preferably, used, for, research, purposes, filter, photometers, are, cheaper, robuster, and, easier, to, use, and, therefore, they, are, used, for, routine, analysis, photometers, for, microtiter, plates, are, filter, photometers, spectrophotometry, in, infrared, light, is, mainly, used, to, study, structure, of, substances, as, given, groups, give, absorption, at, defined, wavelengths, measurement, in, aqueous, solution, is, generally, not, possible, as, water, absorbs, infrared, light, strongly, in, some, wavelength, ranges, therefore, infrared, spectroscopy, is, either, performed, in, the, gaseous, phase, for, volatile, substances, or, with, the, substances, pressed, into, tablets, together, with, salts, that, are, transparent, in, the, infrared, range, potassium, bromide, kbr, is, commonly, used, for, this, purpose, the, substance, being, tested, is, thoroughly, mixed, with, specially, purified, kbr, and, pressed, into, a, transparent, tablet, that, is, placed, in, the, beam, of, light, the, analysis, of, the, wavelength, dependence, is, generally, not, done, using, a, monochromator, as, it, is, in, uv, vis, but, with, the, use, of, an, interferometer, the, interference, pattern, can, be, analyzed, using, a, fourier, transform, algorithm, in, this, way, the, whole, wavelength, range, can, be, analyzed, simultaneously, saving, time, and, an, interferometer, is, also, less, expensive, than, a, monochromator, the, light, absorbed, in, the, infrared, region, does, not, correspond, to, electronic, excitation, of, the, substance, studied, but, rather, to, different, kinds, of, vibrational, excitation, the, vibrational, excitations, are, characteristic, of, different, groups, in, a, molecule, that, can, in, this, way, be, identified, the, infrared, spectrum, typically, has, very, narrow, absorption, lines, which, makes, them, unsuited, for, quantitative, analysis, but, gives, very, detailed, information, about, the, molecules, the, frequencies, of, the, different, modes, of, vibration, varies, with, isotope, and, therefore, different, isotopes, give, different, peaks, this, makes, it, possible, also, to, study, the, isotopic, composition, of, a, sample, with, infrared, spectrophotometry, atomic, absorption, photometers, are, photometers, that, measure, the, light, from, a, very, hot, flame, the, solution, to, be, analyzed, is, injected, into, the, flame, at, a, constant, known, rate, metals, in, the, solution, are, present, in, atomic, form, in, the, flame, the, monochromatic, light, in, this, type, of, photometer, is, generated, by, a, discharge, lamp, where, the, discharge, takes, place, in, a, gas, with, the, metal, to, be, determined, the, discharge, then, emits, light, with, wavelengths, corresponding, to, the, spectral, lines, of, the, metal, a, filter, may, be, used, to, isolate, one, of, the, main, spectral, lines, of, the, metal, to, be, analyzed, the, light, is, absorbed, by, the, metal, in, the, flame, and, the, absorption, is, used, to, determine, the, concentration, of, the, metal, in, the, original, solution, article, partly, based, on, the, corresponding, article, in, swedish, wikipedia
