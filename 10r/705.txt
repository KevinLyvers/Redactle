an, airplane, north, american, english, or, aeroplane, british, english, informally, plane, is, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, that, is, propelled, forward, by, thrust, from, a, jet, engine, propeller, or, rocket, engine, airplanes, come, in, a, variety, of, sizes, shapes, and, wing, configurations, the, broad, spectrum, of, uses, for, airplanes, includes, recreation, transportation, of, goods, and, people, military, and, research, worldwide, commercial, aviation, transports, more, than, four, billion, passengers, annually, on, airliners, and, transports, more, than, 200, billion, tonne, kilometers, of, cargo, annually, which, is, less, than, 1, of, the, world, s, cargo, movement, most, airplanes, are, flown, by, a, pilot, on, board, the, aircraft, but, some, are, designed, to, be, remotely, or, computer, controlled, such, as, drones, the, wright, brothers, invented, and, flew, the, first, airplane, in, 1903, recognized, as, the, first, sustained, and, controlled, heavier, than, air, powered, flight, they, built, on, the, works, of, george, cayley, dating, from, 1799, when, he, set, forth, the, concept, of, the, modern, airplane, and, later, built, and, flew, models, and, successful, passenger, carrying, gliders, and, the, work, of, german, pioneer, of, human, aviation, otto, lilienthal, who, between, 1867, and, 1896, also, studied, heavier, than, air, flight, lilienthal, s, flight, attempts, in, 1891, are, seen, as, the, beginning, of, human, flight, following, its, limited, use, in, world, war, i, aircraft, technology, continued, to, develop, airplanes, had, a, presence, in, all, the, major, battles, of, world, war, ii, the, first, jet, aircraft, was, the, german, heinkel, he, 178, in, 1939, the, first, jet, airliner, the, de, havilland, comet, was, introduced, in, 1952, the, boeing, 707, the, first, widely, successful, commercial, jet, was, in, commercial, service, for, more, than, 60, years, from, 1958, to, 2019, first, attested, in, english, in, the, late, 19th, century, prior, to, the, first, sustained, powered, flight, the, word, airplane, like, aeroplane, derives, from, the, french, a, roplane, which, comes, from, the, greek, a, r, air, and, either, latin, planus, level, or, greek, planos, wandering, a, roplane, originally, referred, just, to, the, wing, as, it, is, a, plane, moving, through, the, air, in, an, example, of, synecdoche, the, word, for, the, wing, came, to, refer, to, the, entire, aircraft, in, the, united, states, and, canada, the, term, airplane, is, used, for, powered, fixed, wing, aircraft, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, and, most, of, the, commonwealth, the, term, aeroplane, r, p, l, e, n, is, usually, applied, to, these, aircraft, many, stories, from, antiquity, involve, flight, such, as, the, greek, legend, of, icarus, and, daedalus, and, the, vimana, in, ancient, indian, epics, around, 400, bc, in, greece, archytas, was, reputed, to, have, designed, and, built, the, first, artificial, self, propelled, flying, device, a, bird, shaped, model, propelled, by, a, jet, of, what, was, probably, steam, said, to, have, flown, some, 200, m, 660, ft, this, machine, may, have, been, suspended, for, its, flight, some, of, the, earliest, recorded, attempts, with, gliders, were, those, by, the, 9th, century, andalusian, and, arabic, language, poet, abbas, ibn, firnas, and, the, 11th, century, english, monk, eilmer, of, malmesbury, both, experiments, injured, their, pilots, leonardo, da, vinci, researched, the, wing, design, of, birds, and, designed, a, man, powered, aircraft, in, his, codex, on, the, flight, of, birds, 1502, noting, for, the, first, time, the, distinction, between, the, center, of, mass, and, the, center, of, pressure, of, flying, birds, in, 1799, george, cayley, set, forth, the, concept, of, the, modern, airplane, as, a, fixed, wing, flying, machine, with, separate, systems, for, lift, propulsion, and, control, cayley, was, building, and, flying, models, of, fixed, wing, aircraft, as, early, as, 1803, and, he, built, a, successful, passenger, carrying, glider, in, 1853, in, 1856, frenchman, jean, marie, le, bris, made, the, first, powered, flight, by, having, his, glider, l, albatros, artificiel, pulled, by, a, horse, on, a, beach, then, the, russian, alexander, f, mozhaisky, also, made, some, innovative, designs, in, 1883, the, american, john, j, montgomery, made, a, controlled, flight, in, a, glider, other, aviators, who, made, similar, flights, at, that, time, were, otto, lilienthal, percy, pilcher, and, octave, chanute, sir, hiram, maxim, built, a, craft, that, weighed, 3, 5, tons, with, a, 110, foot, 34, m, wingspan, that, was, powered, by, two, 360, horsepower, 270, kw, steam, engines, driving, two, propellers, in, 1894, his, machine, was, tested, with, overhead, rails, to, prevent, it, from, rising, the, test, showed, that, it, had, enough, lift, to, take, off, the, craft, was, uncontrollable, and, it, is, presumed, that, maxim, realized, this, because, he, subsequently, abandoned, work, on, it, between, 1867, and, 1896, the, german, pioneer, of, human, aviation, otto, lilienthal, developed, heavier, than, air, flight, he, was, the, first, person, to, make, well, documented, repeated, successful, gliding, flights, lilienthal, s, work, led, to, him, developing, the, concept, of, the, modern, wing, his, flight, attempts, in, 1891, are, seen, as, the, beginning, of, human, flight, the, lilienthal, normalsegelapparat, is, considered, to, be, the, first, airplane, in, series, production, and, his, work, heavily, inspired, the, wright, brothers, in, the, 1890s, lawrence, hargrave, conducted, research, on, wing, structures, and, developed, a, box, kite, that, lifted, the, weight, of, a, man, his, box, kite, designs, were, widely, adopted, although, he, also, developed, a, type, of, rotary, aircraft, engine, he, did, not, create, and, fly, a, powered, fixed, wing, aircraft, the, frenchman, clement, ader, constructed, his, first, of, three, flying, machines, in, 1886, the, ole, it, was, a, bat, like, design, run, by, a, lightweight, steam, engine, of, his, own, invention, with, four, cylinders, developing, 20, horsepower, 15, kw, driving, a, four, blade, propeller, the, engine, weighed, no, more, than, 4, kilograms, per, kilowatt, 6, 6, lb, hp, the, wings, had, a, span, of, 14, m, 46, ft, all, up, weight, was, 300, kilograms, 660, lb, on, 9, october, 1890, ader, attempted, to, fly, the, ole, aviation, historians, give, credit, to, this, effort, as, a, powered, take, off, and, uncontrolled, hop, of, approximately, 50, m, 160, ft, at, a, height, of, approximately, 200, mm, 7, 9, in, ader, s, two, subsequent, machines, were, not, documented, to, have, achieved, flight, the, american, wright, brothers, s, flights, in, 1903, are, recognized, by, the, f, d, ration, a, ronautique, internationale, fai, the, standard, setting, and, record, keeping, body, for, aeronautics, as, the, first, sustained, and, controlled, heavier, than, air, powered, flight, by, 1905, the, wright, flyer, iii, was, capable, of, fully, controllable, stable, flight, for, substantial, periods, the, wright, brothers, credited, otto, lilienthal, as, a, major, inspiration, for, their, decision, to, pursue, manned, flight, in, 1906, the, brazilian, alberto, santos, dumont, made, what, was, claimed, to, be, the, first, airplane, flight, unassisted, by, catapult, and, set, the, first, world, record, recognized, by, the, a, ro, club, de, france, by, flying, 220, meters, 720, ft, in, less, than, 22, seconds, this, flight, was, also, certified, by, the, fai, an, early, aircraft, design, that, brought, together, the, modern, monoplane, tractor, configuration, was, the, bl, riot, viii, design, of, 1908, it, had, movable, tail, surfaces, controlling, both, yaw, and, pitch, a, form, of, roll, control, supplied, either, by, wing, warping, or, by, ailerons, and, controlled, by, its, pilot, with, a, joystick, and, rudder, bar, it, was, an, important, predecessor, of, his, later, bl, riot, xi, channel, crossing, aircraft, of, the, summer, of, 1909, world, war, i, served, as, a, testbed, for, the, use, of, the, airplane, as, a, weapon, airplanes, demonstrated, their, potential, as, mobile, observation, platforms, then, proved, themselves, to, be, machines, of, war, capable, of, causing, casualties, to, the, enemy, the, earliest, known, aerial, victory, with, a, synchronized, machine, gun, armed, fighter, aircraft, occurred, in, 1915, by, german, luftstreitkr, fte, leutnant, kurt, wintgens, fighter, aces, appeared, the, greatest, by, number, of, aerial, combat, victories, was, manfred, von, richthofen, also, known, as, the, red, baron, following, wwi, aircraft, technology, continued, to, develop, alcock, and, brown, crossed, the, atlantic, non, stop, for, the, first, time, in, 1919, the, first, international, commercial, flights, took, place, between, the, united, states, and, canada, in, 1919, airplanes, had, a, presence, in, all, the, major, battles, of, world, war, ii, they, were, an, essential, component, of, the, military, strategies, of, the, period, such, as, the, german, blitzkrieg, the, battle, of, britain, and, the, american, and, japanese, aircraft, carrier, campaigns, of, the, pacific, war, the, first, practical, jet, aircraft, was, the, german, heinkel, he, 178, which, was, tested, in, 1939, in, 1943, the, messerschmitt, me, 262, the, first, operational, jet, fighter, aircraft, went, into, service, in, the, german, luftwaffe, the, first, jet, airliner, the, de, havilland, comet, was, introduced, in, 1952, the, boeing, 707, the, first, widely, successful, commercial, jet, was, in, commercial, service, for, more, than, 50, years, from, 1958, to, 2010, the, boeing, 747, was, the, world, s, biggest, passenger, aircraft, from, 1970, until, it, was, surpassed, by, the, airbus, a380, in, 2005, supersonic, airliner, flights, including, those, of, the, concorde, have, been, limited, to, over, water, flight, at, supersonic, speed, because, of, their, sonic, boom, which, is, prohibited, over, most, populated, land, areas, the, high, cost, of, operation, per, passenger, mile, and, a, deadly, crash, in, 2000, induced, the, operators, of, the, concorde, to, remove, it, from, service, an, aircraft, propeller, or, airscrew, converts, rotary, motion, from, an, engine, or, other, power, source, into, a, swirling, slipstream, which, pushes, the, propeller, forwards, or, backwards, it, comprises, a, rotating, power, driven, hub, to, which, are, attached, two, or, more, radial, airfoil, section, blades, such, that, the, whole, assembly, rotates, about, a, longitudinal, axis, three, types, of, aviation, engines, used, to, power, propellers, include, reciprocating, engines, or, piston, engines, gas, turbines, and, electric, motors, the, amount, of, thrust, a, propeller, creates, is, determined, in, part, by, its, disk, area, the, area, through, which, the, blades, rotate, the, limitation, on, blade, speed, is, the, speed, of, sound, as, when, the, blade, tip, exceeds, the, speed, of, sound, shock, waves, decrease, propeller, efficiency, the, rpm, required, to, generate, a, given, tip, speed, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, diameter, of, the, propeller, the, upper, design, speed, limit, for, propeller, driven, aircraft, is, mach, 0, 6, aircraft, designed, to, go, faster, than, that, employ, jet, engines, reciprocating, engines, in, aircraft, have, three, main, variants, radial, in, line, and, flat, or, horizontally, opposed, engine, the, radial, engine, is, a, reciprocating, type, internal, combustion, engine, configuration, in, which, the, cylinders, radiate, outward, from, a, central, crankcase, like, the, spokes, of, a, wheel, and, was, commonly, used, for, aircraft, engines, before, gas, turbine, engines, became, predominant, an, inline, engine, is, a, reciprocating, engine, with, banks, of, cylinders, one, behind, another, rather, than, rows, of, cylinders, with, each, bank, having, any, number, of, cylinders, but, rarely, more, than, six, and, may, be, water, cooled, a, flat, engine, is, an, internal, combustion, engine, with, horizontally, opposed, cylinders, a, turboprop, gas, turbine, engine, consists, of, an, intake, compressor, combustor, turbine, and, a, propelling, nozzle, which, provide, power, from, a, shaft, through, a, reduction, gearing, to, the, propeller, the, propelling, nozzle, provides, a, relatively, small, proportion, of, the, thrust, generated, by, a, turboprop, an, electric, aircraft, runs, on, electric, motors, with, electricity, coming, from, fuel, cells, solar, cells, ultracapacitors, power, beaming, or, batteries, currently, flying, electric, aircraft, are, mostly, experimental, prototypes, including, manned, and, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, but, there, are, some, production, models, on, the, market, jet, aircraft, are, propelled, by, jet, engines, which, are, used, because, the, aerodynamic, limitations, of, propellers, do, not, apply, to, jet, propulsion, these, engines, are, much, more, powerful, than, a, reciprocating, engine, for, a, given, size, or, weight, and, are, comparatively, quiet, and, work, well, at, higher, altitude, variants, of, the, jet, engine, include, the, ramjet, and, the, scramjet, which, rely, on, high, airspeed, and, intake, geometry, to, compress, the, combustion, air, prior, to, the, introduction, and, ignition, of, fuel, rocket, motors, provide, thrust, by, burning, a, fuel, with, an, oxidizer, and, expelling, gas, through, a, nozzle, most, jet, aircraft, use, turbofan, jet, engines, which, employ, a, gas, turbine, to, drive, a, ducted, fan, which, accelerates, air, around, the, turbine, to, provide, thrust, in, addition, to, that, which, is, accelerated, through, the, turbine, the, ratio, of, air, passing, around, the, turbine, to, that, passing, through, is, called, the, by, pass, ratio, they, represent, a, compromise, between, turbojet, with, no, bypass, and, turboprop, forms, of, aircraft, propulsion, primarily, powered, with, bypass, air, subsonic, aircraft, such, as, airliners, employ, high, by, pass, jet, engines, for, fuel, efficiency, supersonic, aircraft, such, as, jet, fighters, use, low, bypass, turbofans, however, at, supersonic, speeds, the, air, entering, the, engine, must, be, decelerated, to, a, subsonic, speed, and, then, re, accelerated, back, to, supersonic, speeds, after, combustion, an, afterburner, may, be, used, on, combat, aircraft, to, increase, power, for, short, periods, of, time, by, injecting, fuel, directly, into, the, hot, exhaust, gases, many, jet, aircraft, also, use, thrust, reversers, to, slow, down, after, landing, a, ramjet, is, a, form, of, jet, engine, that, contains, no, major, moving, parts, and, can, be, particularly, useful, in, applications, requiring, a, small, and, simple, engine, for, high, speed, use, such, as, with, missiles, ramjets, require, forward, motion, before, they, can, generate, thrust, and, so, are, often, used, in, conjunction, with, other, forms, of, propulsion, or, with, an, external, means, of, achieving, sufficient, speed, the, lockheed, d, 21, was, a, mach, 3, ramjet, powered, reconnaissance, drone, that, was, launched, from, a, parent, aircraft, a, ramjet, uses, the, vehicle, s, forward, motion, to, force, air, through, the, engine, without, resorting, to, turbines, or, vanes, fuel, is, added, and, ignited, which, heats, and, expands, the, air, to, provide, thrust, a, scramjet, is, a, specialized, ramjet, that, uses, internal, supersonic, airflow, to, compress, combine, with, fuel, combust, and, accelerate, the, exhaust, to, provide, thrust, the, engine, operates, at, supersonic, speeds, only, the, nasa, x, 43, an, experimental, unmanned, scramjet, set, a, world, speed, record, in, 2004, for, a, jet, powered, aircraft, with, a, speed, of, mach, 9, 7, nearly, 12, 100, kilometers, per, hour, 7, 500, mph, whereas, jet, aircraft, use, the, atmosphere, both, as, a, source, of, oxidant, and, of, mass, to, accelerate, reactively, behind, the, aircraft, rocket, aircraft, carry, the, oxidizer, on, board, and, accelerate, the, burned, fuel, and, oxidizer, backwards, as, the, sole, source, of, mass, for, reaction, liquid, fuel, and, oxidizer, may, be, pumped, into, a, combustion, chamber, or, a, solid, fuel, with, oxidizer, may, burn, in, the, fuel, chamber, whether, liquid, or, solid, fueled, the,

flight, was, a, rocket, plane, the, bell, x, 1, in, 1948, the, north, american, x, 15, broke, many, speed, and, altitude, records, in, the, 1960s, and, pioneered, engineering, concepts, for, later, aircraft, and, spacecraft, military, transport, aircraft, may, employ, rocket, assisted, take, offs, for, short, field, situations, otherwise, rocket, aircraft, include, spaceplanes, like, spaceshiptwo, for, travel, beyond, the, earth, s, atmosphere, and, sport, aircraft, developed, for, the, short, lived, rocket, racing, league, most, airplanes, are, constructed, by, companies, with, the, objective, of, producing, them, in, quantity, for, customers, the, design, and, planning, process, including, safety, tests, can, last, up, to, four, years, for, small, turboprops, or, longer, for, larger, planes, during, this, process, the, objectives, and, design, specifications, of, the, aircraft, are, established, first, the, construction, company, uses, drawings, and, equations, simulations, wind, tunnel, tests, and, experience, to, predict, the, behavior, of, the, aircraft, computers, are, used, by, companies, to, draw, plan, and, do, initial, simulations, of, the, aircraft, small, models, and, mockups, of, all, or, certain, parts, of, the, plane, are, then, tested, in, wind, tunnels, to, verify, its, aerodynamics, when, the, design, has, passed, through, these, processes, the, company, constructs, a, limited, number, of, prototypes, for, testing, on, the, ground, representatives, from, an, aviation, governing, agency, often, make, a, first, flight, the, flight, tests, continue, until, the, aircraft, has, fulfilled, all, the, requirements, then, the, governing, public, agency, of, aviation, of, the, country, authorizes, the, company, to, begin, production, in, the, united, states, this, agency, is, the, federal, aviation, administration, faa, in, the, european, union, european, aviation, safety, agency, easa, in, the, united, kingdom, it,

increased, noise, pollution, from, growth, in, air, traffic, over, urban, areas, near, airports, small, planes, can, be, designed, and, constructed, by, amateurs, as, homebuilts, other, homebuilt, aircraft, can, be, assembled, using, pre, manufactured, kits, of, parts, that, can, be, assembled, into, a, basic, plane, and, must, then, be, completed, by, the, builder, few, companies, produce, planes, on, a, large, scale, however, the, production, of, a, plane, for, one, company, is, a, process, that, actually, involves, dozens, or, even, hundreds, of, other, companies, and, plants, that, produce, the, parts, that, go, into, the, plane, for, example, one, company, can, be, responsible, for, the, production, of, the, landing, gear, while, another, one, is, responsible, for, the, radar, the, production, of, such, parts, is, not, limited, to, the, same, city, or, country, in, the, case, of, large, plane, manufacturing, companies, such, parts, can, come, from, all, over, the, world, the, parts, are, sent, to, the, main, plant, of, the, plane, company, where, the, production, line, is, located, in, the, case, of, large, planes, production, lines, dedicated, to, the, assembly, of, certain, parts, of, the, plane, can, exist, especially, the, wings, and, the, fuselage, when, complete, a, plane, is, rigorously, inspected, to, search, for, imperfections, and, defects, after, approval, by, inspectors, the, plane, is, put, through, a, series, of, flight, tests, to, assure, that, all, systems, are, working, correctly, and, that, the, plane, handles, properly, to, meet, a, particular, customer, need, the, airplane, may, be, customised, using, components, or, packages, of, components, provided, by, the, manufacturer, or, the, customer, the, structural, parts, of, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, are, called, the, airframe, the, parts, present, can, vary, according, to, the, aircraft, s, type, and, purpose, early, types, were, usually, made, of, wood, with, fabric, wing, surfaces, when, engines, became, available, for, powered, flight, around, a, hundred, years, ago, their, mounts, were, made, of, metal, then, as, speeds, increased, more, and, more, parts, became, metal, until, by, the, end, of, wwii, all, metal, aircraft, were, common, in, modern, times, increasing, use, of, composite, materials, has, been, made, typical, structural, parts, include, the, wings, of, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, are, static, planes, extending, either, side, of, the, aircraft, when, the, aircraft, travels, forwards, air, flows, over, the, wings, which, are, shaped, to, create, lift, this, shape, is, called, an, airfoil, and, is, shaped, like, a, bird, s, wing, airplanes, have, flexible, wing, surfaces, which, are, stretched, across, a, frame, and, made, rigid, by, the, lift, forces, exerted, by, the, airflow, over, them, larger, aircraft, have, rigid, wing, surfaces, which, provide, additional, strength, whether, flexible, or, rigid, most, wings, have, a, strong, frame, to, give, them, their, shape, and, to, transfer, lift, from, the, wing, surface, to, the, rest, of, the, aircraft, the, main, structural, elements, are, one, or, more, spars, running, from, root, to, tip, and, many, ribs, running, from, the, leading, front, to, the, trailing, rear, edge, early, airplane, engines, had, little, power, and, lightness, was, very, important, also, early, airfoil, sections, were, very, thin, and, could, not, have, a, strong, frame, installed, within, so, until, the, 1930s, most, wings, were, too, lightweight, to, have, enough, strength, and, external, bracing, struts, and, wires, were, added, when, the, available, engine, power, increased, during, the, 1920s, and, 30s, wings, could, be, made, heavy, and, strong, enough, that, bracing, was, not, needed, any, more, this, type, of, unbraced, wing, is, called, a, cantilever, wing, the, number, and, shape, of, the, wings, varies, widely, on, different, types, a, given, wing, plane, may, be, full, span, or, divided, by, a, central, fuselage, into, port, left, and, starboard, right, wings, occasionally, even, more, wings, have, been, used, with, the, three, winged, triplane, achieving, some, fame, in, wwi, the, four, winged, quadruplane, and, other, multiplane, designs, have, had, little, success, a, monoplane, has, a, single, wing, plane, a, biplane, has, two, stacked, one, above, the, other, a, tandem, wing, has, two, placed, one, behind, the, other, when, the, available, engine, power, increased, during, the, 1920s, and, 30s, and, bracing, was, no, longer, needed, the, unbraced, or, cantilever, monoplane, became, the, most, common, form, of, powered, type, the, wing, planform, is, the, shape, when, seen, from, above, to, be, aerodynamically, efficient, a, wing, should, be, straight, with, a, long, span, from, side, to, side, but, have, a, short, chord, high, aspect, ratio, but, to, be, structurally, efficient, and, hence, light, weight, a, wing, must, have, a, short, span, but, still, enough, area, to, provide, lift, low, aspect, ratio, at, transonic, speeds, near, the, speed, of, sound, it, helps, to, sweep, the, wing, backwards, or, forwards, to, reduce, drag, from, supersonic, shock, waves, as, they, begin, to, form, the, swept, wing, is, just, a, straight, wing, swept, backwards, or, forwards, the, delta, wing, is, a, triangle, shape, that, may, be, used, for, several, reasons, as, a, flexible, rogallo, wing, it, allows, a, stable, shape, under, aerodynamic, forces, and, so, is, often, used, for, ultralight, aircraft, and, even, kites, as, a, supersonic, wing, it, combines, high, strength, with, low, drag, and, so, is, often, used, for, fast, jets, a, variable, geometry, wing, can, be, changed, in, flight, to, a, different, shape, the, variable, sweep, wing, transforms, between, an, efficient, straight, configuration, for, takeoff, and, landing, to, a, low, drag, swept, configuration, for, high, speed, flight, other, forms, of, variable, planform, have, been, flown, but, none, have, gone, beyond, the, research, stage, a, fuselage, is, a, long, thin, body, usually, with, tapered, or, rounded, ends, to, make, its, shape, aerodynamically, smooth, the, fuselage, may, contain, the, flight, crew, passengers, cargo, or, payload, fuel, and, engines, the, pilots, of, manned, aircraft, operate, them, from, a, cockpit, located, at, the, front, or, top, of, the, fuselage, and, equipped, with, controls, and, usually, windows, and, instruments, a, plane, may, have, more, than, one, fuselage, or, it, may, be, fitted, with, booms, with, the, tail, located, between, the, booms, to, allow, the, extreme, rear, of, the, fuselage, to, be, useful, for, a, variety, of, purposes, a, flying, wing, is, a, tailless, aircraft, which, has, no, definite, fuselage, most, of, the, crew, payload, and, equipment, are, housed, inside, the, main, wing, structure, the, flying, wing, configuration, was, studied, extensively, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, notably, by, jack, northrop, and, cheston, l, eshelman, in, the, united, states, and, alexander, lippisch, and, the, horten, brothers, in, germany, after, the, war, several, experimental, designs, were, based, on, the, flying, wing, concept, but, the, known, difficulties, remained, intractable, some, general, interest, continued, until, the, early, 1950s, but, designs, did, not, necessarily, offer, a, great, advantage, in, range, and, presented, several, technical, problems, leading, to, the, adoption, of, conventional, solutions, like, the, convair, b, 36, and, the, b, 52, stratofortress, due, to, the, practical, need, for, a, deep, wing, the, flying, wing, concept, is, most, practical, for, designs, in, the, slow, to, medium, speed, range, and, there, has, been, continual, interest, in, using, it, as, a, tactical, airlifter, design, interest, in, flying, wings, was, renewed, in, the, 1980s, due, to, their, potentially, low, radar, reflection, cross, sections, stealth, technology, relies, on, shapes, which, only, reflect, radar, waves, in, certain, directions, thus, making, the, aircraft, hard, to, detect, unless, the, radar, receiver, is, at, a, specific, position, relative, to, the, aircraft, a, position, that, changes, continuously, as, the, aircraft, moves, this, approach, eventually, led, to, the, northrop, b, 2, spirit, stealth, bomber, in, this, case, the, aerodynamic, advantages, of, the, flying, wing, are, not, the, primary, needs, however, modern, computer, controlled, fly, by, wire, systems, allowed, for, many, of, the, aerodynamic, drawbacks, of, the, flying, wing, to, be, minimized, making, for, an, efficient, and, stable, long, range, bomber, blended, wing, body, aircraft, have, a, flattened, and, airfoil, shaped, body, which, produces, most, of, the, lift, to, keep, itself, aloft, and, distinct, and, separate, wing, structures, though, the, wings, are, smoothly, blended, in, with, the, body, thus, blended, wing, bodied, aircraft, incorporate, design, features, from, both, a, futuristic, fuselage, and, flying, wing, design, the, purported, advantages, of, the, blended, wing, body, approach, are, efficient, high, lift, wings, and, a, wide, airfoil, shaped, body, this, enables, the, entire, craft, to, contribute, to, lift, generation, with, the, result, of, potentially, increased, fuel, economy, a, lifting, body, is, a, configuration, in, which, the, body, itself, produces, lift, in, contrast, to, a, flying, wing, which, is, a, wing, with, minimal, or, no, conventional, fuselage, a, lifting, body, can, be, thought, of, as, a, fuselage, with, little, or, no, conventional, wing, whereas, a, flying, wing, seeks, to, maximize, cruise, efficiency, at, subsonic, speeds, by, eliminating, non, lifting, surfaces, lifting, bodies, generally, minimize, the, drag, and, structure, of, a, wing, for, subsonic, supersonic, and, hypersonic, flight, or, spacecraft, re, entry, all, of, these, flight, regimes, pose, challenges, for, proper, flight, stability, lifting, bodies, were, a, major, area, of, research, in, the, 1960s, and, 70s, as, a, means, to, build, a, small, and, lightweight, crewed, spacecraft, the, us, built, several, famous, lifting, body, rocket, planes, to, test, the, concept, as, well, as, several, rocket, launched, re, entry, vehicles, that, were, tested, over, the, pacific, interest, waned, as, the, us, air, force, lost, interest, in, the, crewed, mission, and, major, development, ended, during, the, space, shuttle, design, process, when, it, became, clear, that, the, highly, shaped, fuselages, made, it, difficult, to, fit, fuel, tankage, the, classic, airfoil, section, wing, is, unstable, in, flight, and, difficult, to, control, flexible, wing, types, often, rely, on, an, anchor, line, or, the, weight, of, a, pilot, hanging, beneath, to, maintain, the, correct, attitude, some, free, flying, types, use, an, adapted, airfoil, that, is, stable, or, other, ingenious, mechanisms, including, most, recently, electronic, artificial, stability, to, achieve, stability, and, control, most, fixed, wing, types, have, an, empennage, comprising, a, fin, and, rudder, which, act, horizontally, and, a, tailplane, and, elevator, which, act, vertically, these, control, surfaces, can, typically, be, trimmed, to, relieve, control, forces, for, various, stages, of, flight, this, is, so, common, that, it, is, known, as, the, conventional, layout, sometimes, there, may, be, two, or, more, fins, spaced, out, along, the, tailplane, some, types, have, a, horizontal, canard, foreplane, ahead, of, the, main, wing, instead, of, behind, it, this, foreplane, may, contribute, to, the, lift, the, trim, or, control, of, the, aircraft, or, to, several, of, these, airplanes, have, complex, flight, control, systems, the, main, controls, allow, the, pilot, to, direct, the, aircraft, in, the, air, by, controlling, the, attitude, roll, pitch, and, yaw, and, engine, thrust, on, manned, aircraft, cockpit, instruments, provide, information, to, the, pilots, including, flight, data, engine, output, navigation, communications, and, other, aircraft, systems, that, may, be, installed, when, risk, is, measured, by, deaths, per, passenger, kilometer, air, travel, is, approximately, 10, times, safer, than, travel, by, bus, or, rail, however, when, using, the, deaths, per, journey, statistic, air, travel, is, significantly, more, dangerous, than, car, rail, or, bus, travel, air, travel, insurance, is, relatively, expensive, for, this, reason, insurers, generally, use, the, deaths, per, journey, statistic, there, is, a, significant, difference, between, the, safety, of, airliners, and, that, of, smaller, private, planes, with, the, per, mile, statistic, indicating, that, airliners, are, 8, 3, times, safer, than, smaller, planes, like, all, activities, involving, combustion, fossil, fuel, powered, aircraft, release, soot, and, other, pollutants, into, the, atmosphere, greenhouse, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, are, also, produced, in, addition, there, are, environmental, impacts, specific, to, airplanes, for, instance, another, environmental, impact, of, airplanes, is, noise, pollution, mainly, caused, by, aircraft, taking, off, and, landing
