hydroelectricity, or, hydroelectric, power, is, electricity, generated, from, hydropower, water, power, hydropower, supplies, 14, of, the, world, s, electricity, almost, 4, 210, twh, in, 2023, which, is, more, than, all, other, renewable, sources, combined, and, also, more, than, nuclear, power, hydropower, can, provide, large, amounts, of, low, carbon, electricity, on, demand, making, it, a, key, element, for, creating, secure, and, clean, electricity, supply, systems, a, hydroelectric, power, station, that, has, a, dam, and, reservoir, is, a, flexible, source, since, the, amount, of, electricity, produced, can, be, increased, or, decreased, in, seconds, or, minutes, in, response, to, varying, electricity, demand, once, a, hydroelectric, complex, is, constructed, it, produces, no, direct, waste, and, almost, always, emits, considerably, less, greenhouse, gas, than, fossil, fuel, powered, energy, plants, however, when, constructed, in, lowland, rainforest, areas, where, part, of, the, forest, is, inundated, substantial, amounts, of, greenhouse, gases, may, be, emitted, construction, of, a, hydroelectric, complex, can, have, significant, environmental, impact, principally, in, loss, of, arable, land, and, population, displacement, they, also, disrupt, the, natural, ecology, of, the, river, involved, affecting, habitats, and, ecosystems, and, siltation, and, erosion, patterns, while, dams, can, ameliorate, the, risks, of, flooding, dam, failure, can, be, catastrophic, in, 2021, global, installed, hydropower, electrical, capacity, reached, almost, 1, 400, gw, the, highest, among, all, renewable, energy, technologies, hydroelectricity, plays, a, leading, role, in, countries, like, brazil, norway, and, china, but, there, are, geographical, limits, and, environmental, issues, tidal, power, can, be, used, in, coastal, regions, china, added, 24, gw, in, 2022, accounting, for, nearly, three, quarters, of, global, hydropower, capacity, additions, europe, added, 2, gw, the, largest, amount, for, the, region, since, 1990, meanwhile, globally, hydropower, generation, increased, by, 70, twh, up, 2, in, 2022, and, remains, the, largest, renewable, energy, source, surpassing, all, other, technologies, combined, hydropower, has, been, used, since, ancient, times, to, grind, flour, and, perform, other, tasks, in, the, late, 18th, century, hydraulic, power, provided, the, energy, source, needed, for, the, start, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, mid, 1700s, french, engineer, bernard, forest, de, b, lidor, published, architecture, hydraulique, which, described, vertical, and, horizontal, axis, hydraulic, machines, and, in, 1771, richard, arkwright, s, combination, of, water, power, the, water, frame, and, continuous, production, played, a, significant, part, in, the, development, of, the, factory, system, with, modern, employment, practices, in, the, 1840s, hydraulic, power, networks, were, developed, to, generate, and, transmit, hydro, power, to, end, users, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, electrical, generator, was, developed, and, could, now, be, coupled, with, hydraulics, the, growing, demand, arising, from, the, industrial, revolution, would, drive, development, as, well, in, 1878, the, world, s, first, hydroelectric, power, scheme, was, developed, at, cragside, in, northumberland, england, by, william, armstrong, it, was, used, to, power, a, single, arc, lamp, in, his, art, gallery, the, old, schoelkopf, power, station, no, 1, us, near, niagara, falls, began, to, produce, electricity, in, 1881, the, first, edison, hydroelectric, power, station, the, vulcan, street, plant, began, operating, september, 30, 1882, in, appleton, wisconsin, with, an, output, of, about, 12, 5, kilowatts, by, 1886, there, were, 45, hydroelectric, power, stations, in, the, united, states, and, canada, and, by, 1889, there, were, 200, in, the, united, states, alone, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, many, small, hydroelectric, power, stations, were, being, constructed, by, commercial, companies, in, mountains, near, metropolitan, areas, grenoble, france, held, the, international, exhibition, of, hydropower, and, tourism, with, over, one, million, visitors, 1925, by, 1920, when, 40, of, the, power, produced, in, the, united, states, was, hydroelectric, the, federal, power, act, was, enacted, into, law, the, act, created, the, federal, power, commission, to, regulate, hydroelectric, power, stations, on, federal, land, and, water, as, the, power, stations, became, larger, their, associated, dams, developed, additional, purposes, including, flood, control, irrigation, and, navigation, federal, funding, became, necessary, for, large, scale, development, and, federally, owned, corporations, such, as, the, tennessee, valley, authority, 1933, and, the, bonneville, power, administration, 1937, were, created, additionally, the, bureau, of, reclamation, which, had, begun, a, series, of, western, us, irrigation, projects, in, the, early, 20th, century, was, now, constructing, large, hydroelectric, projects, such, as, the, 1928, hoover, dam, the, united, states, army, corps, of, engineers, was, also, involved, in, hydroelectric, development, completing, the, bonneville, dam, in, 1937, and, being, recognized, by, the, flood, control, act, of, 1936, as, the, premier, federal, flood, control, agency, hydroelectric, power, stations, continued, to, become, larger, throughout, the, 20th, century, hydropower, was, referred, to, as, white, coal, hoover, dam, s, initial, 1, 345, mw, power, station, was, the, world, s, largest, hydroelectric, power, station, in, 1936, it, was, eclipsed, by, the, 6, 809, mw, grand, coulee, dam, in, 1942, the, itaipu, dam, opened, in, 1984, in, south, america, as, the, largest, producing, 14, gw, but, was, surpassed, in, 2008, by, the, three, gorges, dam, in, china, at, 22, 5, gw, hydroelectricity, would, eventually, supply, some, countries, including, norway, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, paraguay, and, brazil, with, over, 85, of, their, electricity, in, 2021, the, international, energy, agency, iea, said, that, more, efforts, are, needed, to, help, limit, climate, change, some, countries, have, highly, developed, their, hydropower, potential, and, have, very, little, room, for, growth, switzerland, produces, 88, of, its, potential, and, mexico, 80, in, 2022, the, iea, released, a, main, case, forecast, of, 141, gw, generated, by, hydropower, over, 2022, 2027, which, is, slightly, lower, than, deployment, achieved, from, 2017, 2022, because, environmental, permitting, and, construction, times, are, long, they, estimate, hydropower, potential, will, remain, limited, with, only, an, additional, 40, gw, deemed, possible, in, the, accelerated, case, in, 2021, the, iea, said, that, major, modernisation, refurbishments, are, required, 67, most, hydroelectric, power, comes, from, the, potential, energy, of, dammed, water, driving, a, water, turbine, and, generator, the, power, extracted, from, the, water, depends, on, the, volume, and, on, the, difference, in, height, between, the, source, and, the, water, s, outflow, this, height, difference, is, called, the, head, a, large, pipe, the, penstock, delivers, water, from, the, reservoir, to, the, turbine, this, method, produces, electricity, to, supply, high, peak, demands, by, moving, water, between, reservoirs, at, different, elevations, at, times, of, low, electrical, demand, the, excess, generation, capacity, is, used, to, pump, water, into, the, higher, reservoir, thus, providing, demand, side, response, when, the, demand, becomes, greater, water, is, released, back, into, the, lower, reservoir, through, a, turbine, in, 2021, pumped, storage, schemes, provided, almost, 85, of, the, world, s, 190, gw, of, grid, energy, storage, and, improve, the, daily, capacity, factor, of, the, generation, system, pumped, storage, is, not, an, energy, source, and, appears, as, a, negative, number, in, listings, run, of, the, river, hydroelectric, stations, are, those, with, small, or, no, reservoir, capacity, so, that, only, the, water, coming, from, upstream, is, available, for, generation, at, that, moment, and, any, oversupply, must, pass, unused, a, constant, supply, of, water, from, a, lake, or, existing, reservoir, upstream, is, a, significant, advantage, in, choosing, sites, for, run, of, the, river, a, tidal, power, station, makes, use, of, the, daily, rise, and, fall, of, ocean, water, due, to, tides, such, sources, are, highly, predictable, and, if, conditions, permit, construction, of, reservoirs, can, also, be, dispatchable, to, generate, power, during, high, demand, periods, less, common, types, of, hydro, schemes, use, water, s, kinetic, energy, or, undammed, sources, such, as, undershot, water, wheels, tidal, power, is, viable, in, a, relatively, small, number, of, locations, around, the, world, the, classification, of, hydropower, plants, starts, with, two, top, level, categories, the, classification, of, a, plant, as, an, shp, or, lhp, is, primarily, based, on, its, nameplate, capacity, the, threshold, varies, by, the, country, but, in, any, case, a, plant, with, the, capacity, of, 50, mw, or, more, is, considered, an, lhp, as, an, example, for, china, shp, power, is, below, 25, mw, for, india, below, 15, mw, most, of, europe, below, 10, mw, the, shp, and, lhp, categories, are, further, subdivided, into, many, subcategories, that, are, not, mutually, exclusive, for, example, a, low, head, hydro, power, plant, with, hydrostatic, head, of, few, meters, to, few, tens, of, meters, can, be, classified, either, as, an, shp, or, an, lhp, the, other, distinction, between, shp, and, lhp, is, the, degree, of, the, water, flow, regulation, a, typical, shp, primarily, uses, the, natural, water, discharge, with, very, little, regulation, in, comparison, to, an, lhp, therefore, the, term, shp, is, frequently, used, as, a, synonym, for, the, run, of, the, river, power, plant, the, largest, power, producers, in, the, world, are, hydroelectric, power, stations, with, some, hydroelectric, facilities, capable, of, generating, more, than, double, the, installed, capacities, of, the, current, largest, nuclear, power, stations, although, no, official, definition, exists, for, the, capacity, range, of, large, hydroelectric, power, stations, facilities, from, over, a, few, hundred, megawatts, are, generally, considered, large, hydroelectric, facilities, currently, only, seven, facilities, over, 10, gw, 10, 000, mw, are, in, operation, worldwide, see, table, below, small, hydro, is, hydroelectric, power, on, a, scale, serving, a, small, community, or, industrial, plant, the, definition, of, a, small, hydro, project, varies, but, a, generating, capacity, of, up, to, 10, megawatts, mw, is, generally, accepted, as, the, upper, limit, this, may, be, stretched, to, 25, mw, and, 30, mw, in, canada, and, the, united, states, small, hydro, stations, may, be, connected, to, conventional, electrical, distribution, networks, as, a, source, of, low, cost, renewable, energy, alternatively, small, hydro, projects, may, be, built, in, isolated, areas, that, would, be, uneconomic, to, serve, from, a, grid, or, in, areas, where, there, is, no, national, electrical, distribution, network, since, small, hydro, projects, usually, have, minimal, reservoirs, and, civil, construction, work, they, are, seen, as, having, a, relatively, low, environmental, impact, compared, to, large, hydro, this, decreased, environmental, impact, depends, strongly, on, the, balance, between, stream, flow, and, power, production, micro, hydro, means, hydroelectric, power, installations, that, typically, produce, up, to, 100, kw, of, power, these, installations, can, provide, power, to, an, isolated, home, or, small, community, or, are, sometimes, connected, to, electric, power, networks, there, are, many, of, these, installations, around, the, world, particularly, in, developing, nations, as, they, can, provide, an, economical, source, of, energy, without, purchase, of, fuel, micro, hydro, systems, complement, photovoltaic, solar, energy, systems, because, in, many, areas, water, flow, and, thus, available, hydro, power, is, highest, in, the, winter, when, solar, energy, is, at, a, minimum, pico, hydro, is, hydroelectric, power, generation, of, under, 5, kw, it, is, useful, in, small, remote, communities, that, require, only, a, small, amount, of, electricity, for, example, the, 1, 1, kw, intermediate, technology, development, group, pico, hydro, project, in, kenya, supplies, 57, homes, with, very, small, electric, loads, e, g, a, couple, of, lights, and, a, phone, charger, or, a, small, tv, radio, even, smaller, turbines, of, 200, 300, w, may, power, a, few, homes, in, a, developing, country, with, a, drop, of, only, 1, m, 3, ft, a, pico, hydro, setup, is, typically, run, of, the, river, meaning, that, dams, are, not, used, but, rather, pipes, divert, some, of, the, flow, drop, this, down, a, gradient, and, through, the, turbine, before, returning, it, to, the, stream, an, underground, power, station, is, generally, used, at, large, facilities, and, makes, use, of, a, large, natural, height, difference, between, two, waterways, such, as, a, waterfall, or, mountain, lake, a, tunnel, is, constructed, to, take, water, from, the, high, reservoir, to, the, generating, hall, built, in, a, cavern, near, the, lowest, point, of, the, water, tunnel, and, a, horizontal, tailrace, taking, water, away, to, the, lower, outlet, waterway, a, simple, formula, for, approximating, electric, power, production, at, a, hydroelectric, station, is, p, m, g, h, v, g, h, displaystyle, p, eta, dot, m, g, delta, h, eta, rho, dot, v, g, delta, h, where, efficiency, is, often, higher, that, is, closer, to, 1, with, larger, and, more, modern, turbines, annual, electric, energy, production, depends, on, the, available, water, supply, in, some, installations, the, water, flow, rate, can, vary, by, a, factor, of, 10, 1, over, the, course, of, a, year, hydropower, is, a, flexible, source, of, electricity, since, stations, can, be, ramped, up, and, down, very, quickly, to, adapt, to, changing, energy, demands, hydro, turbines, have, a, start, up, time, of, the, order, of, a, few, minutes, although, battery, power, is, quicker, its, capacity, is, tiny, compared, to, hydro, it, takes, less, than, 10, minutes, to, bring, most, hydro, units, from, cold, start, up, to, full, load, this, is, quicker, than, nuclear, and, almost, all, fossil, fuel, power, power, generation, can, also, be, decreased, quickly, when, there, is, a, surplus, power, generation, hence, the, limited, capacity, of, hydropower, units, is, not, generally, used, to, produce, base, power, except, for, vacating, the, flood, pool, or, meeting, downstream, needs, instead, it, can, serve, as, backup, for, non, hydro, generators, the, major, advantage, of, conventional, hydroelectric, dams, with, reservoirs, is, their, ability, to, store, water, at, low, cost, for, dispatch, later, as, high, value, clean, electricity, in, 2021, the, iea, estimated, that, the, reservoirs, of, all, existing, conventional, hydropower, plants, combined, can, store, a, total, of, 1, 500, terawatt, hours, twh, of, electrical, energy, in, one, full, cycle, which, was, about, 170, times, more, energy, than, the, global, fleet, of, pumped, storage, hydropower, plants, battery, storage, capacity, is, not, expected, to, overtake, pumped, storage, during, the, 2020s, when, used, as, peak, power, to, meet, demand, hydroelectricity, has, a, higher, value, than, baseload, power, and, a, much, higher, value, compared, to, intermittent, energy, sources, such, as, wind, and, solar, hydroelectric, stations, have, long, economic, lives, with, some, plants, still, in, service, after, 50, 100, years, operating, labor, cost, is, also, usually, low, as, plants, are, automated, and, have, few, personnel, on, site, during, normal, operation, where, a, dam, serves, multiple, purposes, a, hydroelectric, station, may, be, added, with, relatively, low, construction, cost, providing, a, useful, revenue, stream, to, offset, the, costs, of, dam, operation, it, has, been, calculated, that, the, sale, of, electricity, from, the, three, gorges, dam, will, cover, the, construction, costs, after, 5, to, 8, years, of, full, generation, however, some, data, shows, that, in, most, countries, large, hydropower, dams, will, be, too, costly, and, take, too, long, to, build, to, deliver, a, positive, risk, adjusted, return, unless, appropriate, risk, management, measures, are, put, in, place, while, many, hydroelectric, projects, supply, public, electricity, networks, some, are, created, to, serve, specific, industrial, enterprises, dedicated, hydroelectric, projects, are, often, built, to, provide, the, substantial, amounts, of, electricity, needed, for, aluminium, electrolytic, plants, for, example, the, grand, coulee, dam, switched, to, support, alcoa, aluminium, in, bellingham, washington, united, states, for, american, world, war, ii, airplanes, before, it, was, allowed, to, provide, irrigation, and, power, to, citizens, in, addition, to, aluminium, power, after, the, war, in, suriname, the, brokopondo, reservoir, was, constructed, to, provide, electricity, for, the, alcoa, aluminium, industry, new, zealand, s, manapouri, power, station, was, constructed, to, supply, electricity, to, the, aluminium, smelter, at, tiwai, point, since, hydroelectric, dams, do, not, use, fuel, power, generation, does, not, produce, carbon, dioxide, while, carbon, dioxide, is, initially, produced, during, construction, of, the, project, and, some, methane, is, given, off, annually, by, reservoirs, hydro, has, one, of, the, lowest, lifecycle, greenhouse, gas, emissions, for, electricity, generation, the, low, greenhouse, gas, impact, of, hydroelectricity, is, found, especially, in, temperate, climates, greater, greenhouse, gas, emission, impacts, are, found, in, the, tropical, regions, because, the, reservoirs, of, power, stations, in, tropical, regions, produce, a, larger, amount, of, methane, than, those, in, temperate, areas, like, other, non, fossil, fuel, sources, hydropower, also, has, no, emissions, of, sulfur, dioxide, nitrogen, oxides, or, other, particulates, reservoirs, created, by, hydroelectric, schemes, often, provide, facilities, for, water, sports, and, become, tourist, attractions, themselves, in, some, countries, aquaculture, in, reservoirs, is, common, multi, use, dams, installed, for, irrigation, support, agriculture, with, a, relatively, constant, water, supply, large, hydro, dams, can, control, floods, which, would, otherwise, affect, people, living, downstream, of, the, project, managing, dams, which, are, also, used, for, other, purposes, such, as, irrigation, is, complicated, in, 2021, the, iea, called, for, robust, sustainability, standards, for, all, hydropower, development, with, streamlined, rules, and, regulations, large, reservoirs, associated, with, traditional, hydroelectric, power, stations, result, in, submersion, of, extensive, areas, upstream, of, the, dams, sometimes, destroying, biologically, rich, and, productive, lowland, and, riverine, valley, forests, marshland, and, grasslands, damming, interrupts, the, flow, of, rivers, and, can, harm, local, ecosystems, and, building, large, dams, and, reservoirs, often, involves, displacing, people, and, wildlife, the, loss, of, land, is, often, exacerbated, by, habitat, fragmentation, of, surrounding, areas, caused, by, the, reservoir, hydroelectric, projects, can, be, disruptive, to, surrounding, aquatic, ecosystems, both, upstream, and, downstream, of, the, plant, site, generation, of, hydroelectric, power, changes, the, downstream, river, environment, water, exiting, a, turbine, usually, contains, very, little, suspended, sediment, which, can, lead, to, scouring, of, river, beds, and, loss, of, riverbanks, the, turbines, also, will, kill, large, portions, of, the, fauna, passing, through, for, instance, 70, of, the, eel, passing, a, turbine, will, perish, immediately, since, turbine, gates, are, often, opened, intermittently, rapid, or, even, daily, fluctuations, in, river, flow, are, observed, drought, and, seasonal, changes, in, rainfall, can, severely, limit, hydropower, water, may, also, be, lost, by, evaporation, when, water, flows, it, has, the, ability, to, transport, particles, heavier, than, itself, downstream, this, has, a, negative, effect, on, dams, and, subsequently, their, power, stations, particularly, those, on, rivers, or, within, catchment, areas, with, high, siltation, siltation, can, fill, a, reservoir, and, reduce, its, capacity, to, control, floods, along, with, causing, additional, horizontal, pressure, on, the, upstream, portion, of, the, dam, eventually, some, reservoirs, can, become, full, of, sediment, and, useless, or, over, top, during, a, flood, and, fail, changes, in, the, amount, of, river, flow, will, correlate, with, the, amount, of, energy, produced, by, a, dam, lower, river, flows, will, reduce, the, amount, of, live, storage, in, a, reservoir, therefore, reducing, the, amount, of, water, that, can, be, used, for, hydroelectricity, the, result, of, diminished, river, flow, can, be, power, shortages, in, areas, that, depend, heavily, on, hydroelectric, power, the, risk, of, flow, shortage, may, increase, as, a, result, of, climate, change, one, study, from, the, colorado, river, in, the, united, states, suggest, that, modest, climate, changes, such, as, an, increase, in, temperature, in, 2, degree, celsius, resulting, in, a, 10, decline, in, precipitation, might, reduce, river, run, off, by, up, to, 40, brazil, in, particular, is, vulnerable, due, to, its, heavy, reliance, on, hydroelectricity, as, increasing, temperatures, lower, water, flow, and, alterations, in, the, rainfall, regime, could, reduce, total, energy, production, by, 7, annually, by, the, end, of, the, century, lower, positive, impacts, are, found, in, the, tropical, regions, in, lowland, rainforest, areas, where, inundation, of, a, part, of, the, forest, is, necessary, it, has, been, noted, that, the, reservoirs, of, power, plants, produce, substantial, amounts, of, methane, this, is, due, to, plant, material, in, flooded, areas, decaying, in, an, anaerobic, environment, and, forming, methane, a, greenhouse, gas, according, to, the, world, commission, on, dams, report, where, the, reservoir, is, large, compared, to, the, generating, capacity, less, than, 100, watts, per, square, metre, of, surface, area, and, no, clearing, of, the, forests, in, the, area, was, undertaken, prior, to, impoundment, of, the, reservoir, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, the, reservoir, may, be, higher, than, those, of, a, conventional, oil, fired, thermal, generation, plant, in, boreal, reservoirs, of, canada, and, northern, europe, however, greenhouse, gas, emissions, are, typically, only, 2, to, 8, of, any, kind, of, conventional, fossil, fuel, thermal, generation, a, new, class, of, underwater, logging, operation, that, targets, drowned, forests, can, mitigate, the, effect, of, forest, decay, another, disadvantage, of, hydroelectric, dams, is, the, need, to, relocate, the, people, living, where, the, reservoirs, are, planned, in, 2000, the, world, commission, on, dams, estimated, that, dams, had, physically, displaced, 40, 80, million, people, worldwide, because, large, conventional, dammed, hydro, facilities, hold, back, large, volumes, of, water, a, failure, due, to, poor, construction, natural, disasters, or, sabotage, can, be, catastrophic, to, downriver, settlements, and, infrastructure, during, typhoon, nina, in, 1975, banqiao, dam, in, southern, china, failed, when, more, than, a, year, s, worth, of, rain, fell, within, 24, hours, see, 1975, banqiao, dam, failure, the, resulting, flood, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, 26, 000, people, and, another, 145, 000, from, epidemics, millions, were, left, homeless, the, creation, of, a, dam, in, a, geologically, inappropriate, location, may, cause, disasters, such, as, 1963, disaster, at, vajont, dam, in, italy, where, almost, 2, 000, people, died, the, malpasset, dam, failure, in, fr, jus, on, the, french, riviera, c, te, d, azur, southern, france, collapsed, on, december, 2, 1959, killing, 423, people, in, the, resulting, flood, smaller, dams, and, micro, hydro, facilities, create, less, risk, but, can, form, continuing, hazards, even, after, being, decommissioned, for, example, the, small, earthen, embankment, kelly, barnes, dam, failed, in, 1977, twenty, years, after, its, power, station, was, decommissioned, causing, 39, deaths, hydroelectricity, eliminates, the, flue, gas, emissions, from, fossil, fuel, combustion, including, pollutants, such, as, sulfur, dioxide, nitric, oxide, carbon, monoxide, dust, and, mercury, in, the, coal, hydroelectricity, also, avoids, the, hazards, of, coal, mining, and, the, indirect, health, effects, of, coal, emissions, in, 2021, the, iea, said, that, government, energy, policy, should, price, in, the, value, of, the, multiple, public, benefits, provided, by, hydropower, plants, nuclear, power, is, relatively, inflexible, although, it, can, reduce, its, output, reasonably, quickly, since, the, cost, of, nuclear, power, is, dominated, by, its, high, infrastructure, costs, the, cost, per, unit, energy, goes, up, significantly, with, low, production, because, of, this, nuclear, power, is, mostly, used, for, baseload, by, way, of, contrast, hydroelectricity, can, supply, peak, power, at, much, lower, cost, hydroelectricity, is, thus, often, used, to, complement, nuclear, or, other, sources, for, load, following, country, examples, where, they, are, paired, in, a, close, to, 50, 50, share, include, the, electric, grid, in, switzerland, the, electricity, sector, in, sweden, and, to, a, lesser, extent, ukraine, and, the, electricity, sector, in, finland, wind, power, goes, through, predictable, variation, by, season, but, is, intermittent, on, a, daily, basis, maximum, wind, generation, has, little, relationship, to, peak, daily, electricity, consumption, the, wind, may, peak, at, night, when, power, is, not, needed, or, be, still, during, the, day, when, electrical, demand, is, highest, occasionally, weather, patterns, can, result, in, low, wind, for, days, or, weeks, at, a, time, a, hydroelectric, reservoir, capable, of, storing, weeks, of, output, is, useful, to, balance, generation, on, the, grid, peak, wind, power, can, be, offset, by, minimum, hydropower, and, minimum, wind, can, be, offset, with, maximum, hydropower, in, this, way, the, easily, regulated, character, of, hydroelectricity, is, used, to, compensate, for, the, intermittent, nature, of, wind, power, conversely, in, some, cases, wind, power, can, be, used, to, spare, water, for, later, use, in, dry, seasons, an, example, of, this, is, norway, s, trading, with, sweden, denmark, the, netherlands, germany, and, the, uk, norway, is, 98, hydropower, while, its, flatland, neighbors, have, wind, power, in, areas, that, do, not, have, hydropower, pumped, storage, serves, a, similar, role, but, at, a, much, higher, cost, and, 20, lower, efficiency, in, 2022, hydro, generated, 4, 289, twh, 15, of, total, electricity, and, half, of,

electricity, from, hydro, and, exports, far, more, than, it, uses, larger, plants, tend, to, be, built, and, operated, by, national, governments, so, most, capacity, 70, is, publicly, owned, despite, the, fact, that, most, plants, nearly, 70, are, owned, and, operated, by, the, private, sector, as, of, 2021, the, following, table, lists, these, data, for, each, country, data, are, sourced, from,
