https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorail
a, monorail, is, a, railway, in, which, the, track, consists, of, a, single, rail, or, beam, colloquially, the, term, monorail, is, often, used, to, describe, any, form, of, elevated, rail, or, people, mover, more, accurately, the, term, refers, to, the, style, of, track, monorail, systems, are, most, frequently, implemented, in, large, cities, airports, and, theme, parks, the, term, possibly, originated, in, 1897, from, german, engineer, eugen, langen, who, called, an, elevated, railway, system, with, wagons, suspended, the, eugen, langen, one, railed, suspension, tramway, einschieniges, h, ngebahnsystem, eugen, langen, monorails, have, found, applications, in, airport, transfers, and, medium, capacity, metros, to, differentiate, monorails, from, other, transport, modes, the, monorail, society, defines, a, monorail, as, a, single, rail, serving, as, a, track, for, passenger, or, freight, vehicles, in, most, cases, rail, is, elevated, but, monorails, can, also, run, at, grade, below, grade, or, in, subway, tunnels, vehicles, either, are, suspended, from, or, straddle, a, narrow, guide, way, monorail, vehicles, are, wider, than, the, guideway, that, supports, them, monorails, are, often, elevated, sometimes, leading, to, confusion, with, other, elevated, systems, such, as, the, docklands, light, railway, vancouver, skytrain, the, airtrain, jfk, and, cable, propelled, systems, like, the, cable, liner, people, mover, which, run, on, two, rails, monorail, vehicles, often, appear, similar, to, light, rail, vehicles, and, can, be, staffed, or, unstaffed, they, can, be, individual, rigid, vehicles, articulated, single, units, or, multiple, units, coupled, into, trains, like, other, advanced, rapid, transit, systems, monorails, can, be, driven, by, linear, induction, motors, like, conventional, railways, vehicle, bodies, can, be, connected, to, the, beam, via, bogies, allowing, curves, to, be, negotiated, monorails, are, sometimes, used, in, urban, areas, alongside, conventional, parallel, railed, metro, systems, mumbai, monorail, serves, alongside, mumbai, metro, while, monorail, lines, are, integrated, with, conventional, rail, rapid, transit, lines, in, bangkok, s, mrt, network, unlike, some, trams, and, light, rail, systems, modern, monorails, are, always, separated, from, other, traffic, and, pedestrians, due, to, the, geometry, of, the, rail, they, are, both, guided, and, supported, via, interaction, with, the, same, single, beam, in, contrast, to, other, guided, systems, like, rubber, tyred, metros, such, as, the, sapporo, municipal, subway, or, guided, buses, or, trams, such, as, translohr, monorails, can, also, use, pantographs, as, with, other, grade, separated, transit, systems, monorails, avoid, red, lights, intersection, turns, and, traffic, jams, surface, level, trains, buses, automobiles, and, pedestrians, can, collide, each, one, with, the, other, while, vehicles, on, dedicated, grade, separated, rights, of, way, such, as, monorails, can, collide, only, with, other, vehicles, on, the, same, system, with, much, fewer, opportunities, for, collision, as, with, other, elevated, transit, systems, monorail, passengers, receive, sunlight, and, views, monorails, can, be, quieter, than, diesel, buses, and, trains, they, obtain, electricity, from, the, track, structure, whereas, other, modes, of, transit, may, use, either, third, rail, or, overhead, power, lines, and, poles, compared, to, the, elevated, train, systems, of, new, york, chicago, and, elsewhere, a, monorail, beamway, casts, a, narrow, shadow, conversely, monorails, can, be, more, expensive, than, light, rail, systems, that, do, not, include, tunnels, in, addition, monorails, must, either, remain, above, ground, or, use, larger, tunnels, than, conventional, rail, systems, and, they, require, complex, track, switching, equipment, under, the, monorail, society, s, beam, width, criterion, some, but, not, all, maglev, systems, are, considered, monorails, such, as, the, transrapid, and, linimo, maglevs, differ, from, other, monorails, in, that, they, do, not, physically, contact, the, beam, while, moving, the, first, monorail, prototype, was, made, in, russia, in, 1820, by, ivan, elmanov, attempts, at, creating, monorail, alternatives, to, conventional, railways, have, been, made, since, the, early, part, of, the, 19th, century, the, centennial, monorail, was, featured, at, the, centennial, exposition, in, philadelphia, in, 1876, based, on, its, design, the, bradford, and, foster, brook, railway, was, built, in, 1877, and, ran, for, one, year, from, january, 1878, until, january, 1879, around, 1879, a, one, rail, system, was, proposed, independently, by, haddon, and, by, stringfellow, which, used, an, inverted, v, rail, and, thus, shaped, like, in, cross, section, it, was, intended, for, military, use, but, was, also, seen, to, have, civilian, use, as, a, cheap, railway, similarly, one, of, the, first, systems, put, into, practical, use, was, that, of, french, engineer, charles, lartigue, who, built, a, line, between, ballybunion, and, listowel, in, ireland, opened, in, 1888, and, lasting, 36, years, being, closed, in, 1924, due, to, damage, from, ireland, s, civil, war, it, used, a, load, bearing, single, rail, and, two, lower, external, rails, for, balance, the, three, carried, on, triangular, supports, it, was, cheap, to, construct, but, tricky, to, operate, possibly, the, first, monorail, locomotive, was, a, 0, 3, 0, steam, locomotive, on, this, line, a, high, speed, monorail, using, the, lartigue, system, was, proposed, in, 1901, between, liverpool, and, manchester, the, boynton, bicycle, railroad, was, a, steam, powered, monorail, in, brooklyn, on, long, island, new, york, it, ran, on, a, single, load, bearing, rail, at, ground, level, but, with, a, wooden, overhead, stabilising, rail, engaged, by, a, pair, of, horizontally, opposed, wheels, the, railway, operated, for, only, two, years, beginning, in, 1890, the, hotchkiss, bicycle, railroad, was, a, monorail, on, which, a, matching, pedal, bicycle, could, be, ridden, the, first, example, was, built, between, smithville, and, mount, holly, new, jersey, in, 1892, it, closed, in, 1897, other, examples, were, built, in, norfolk, from, 1895, to, 1909, great, yarmouth, and, blackpool, uk, from, 1896, early, designs, used, a, double, flanged, single, metal, rail, alternative, to, the, double, rail, of, conventional, railways, both, guiding, and, supporting, the, monorail, car, a, surviving, suspended, version, is, the, oldest, still, in, service, system, the, wuppertal, monorail, in, germany, also, in, the, early, 1900s, gyro, monorails, with, cars, gyroscopically, balanced, on, top, of, a, single, rail, were, tested, but, never, developed, beyond, the, prototype, stage, the, ewing, system, used, in, the, patiala, state, monorail, trainways, in, punjab, india, relies, on, a, hybrid, model, with, a, load, bearing, single, rail, and, an, external, wheel, for, balance, a, highspeed, monorail, using, the, lartigue, system, was, proposed, in, 1901, between, liverpool, and, manchester, in, 1910, the, brennan, gyroscopic, monorail, was, considered, for, use, to, a, coal, mine, in, alaska, in, june, 1920, the, french, patent, office, published, fr, 503782, by, henri, coanda, on, a, transporteur, a, rien, air, carrier, one, of, the, first, monorails, planned, in, the, united, states, was, in, new, york, city, in, the, early, 1930s, scrubbed, for, an, elevated, train, system, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, saw, many, further, proposed, designs, that, either, never, left, the, drawing, board, or, remained, short, lived, prototypes, one, of, the, most, interesting, projects, created, on, the, layout, was, the, ball, bearing, train, by, nikolai, grigorievich, yarmolchuk, this, train, moved, on, spherical, wheels, with, electric, motors, embedded, in, them, which, were, located, in, semi, circular, chutes, under, a, wooden, platform, in, the, full, scale, project, the, trestle, would, have, been, concrete, a, model, train, built, to, 1, 5, scale, to, test, the, vehicle, concept, was, capable, of, reaching, speeds, of, up, to, 70, km, h, the, full, scale, project, was, expected, to, reach, speeds, of, up, to, 300, km, h, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, monorails, had, settled, on, using, larger, beam, or, girder, based, track, with, vehicles, supported, by, one, set, of, wheels, and, guided, by, another, in, the, 1950s, a, 40, scale, prototype, of, a, system, designed, for, speed, of, 200, mph, 320, km, h, on, straight, stretches, and, 90, mph, 140, km, h, on, curves, was, built, in, germany, there, were, designs, with, vehicles, supported, suspended, or, cantilevered, from, the, beams, in, the, 1950s, the, alweg, straddle, design, emerged, followed, by, an, updated, suspended, type, the, safege, system, versions, of, alweg, s, technology, are, used, by, the, two, largest, monorail, manufacturers, hitachi, monorail, and, bombardier, in, 1956, the, first, monorail, to, operate, in, the, us, began, test, operations, in, houston, texas, disneyland, in, anaheim, california, opened, the, united, states, first, daily, operating, monorail, system, in, 1959, later, during, this, period, additional, monorails, were, installed, at, walt, disney, world, in, florida, seattle, and, in, japan, monorails, were, promoted, as, futuristic, technology, with, exhibition, installations, and, amusement, park, purchases, as, seen, by, the, legacy, systems, in, use, today, however, monorails, gained, little, foothold, compared, to, conventional, transport, systems, in, march, 1972, alejandro, goicoechea, omar, had, patent, de1755198, published, on, a, vertebrate, train, build, as, experimental, track, in, las, palmas, de, gran, canaria, spain, niche, private, enterprise, uses, for, monorails, emerged, with, the, emergence, of, air, travel, and, shopping, malls, with, shuttle, type, systems, being, built, from, 1950, to, 1980, the, monorail, concept, may, have, suffered, as, with, all, public, transport, systems, from, competition, with, the, automobile, at, the, time, the, post, world, war, ii, optimism, in, america, was, riding, high, and, people, were, buying, automobiles, in, large, numbers, due, to, suburbanization, and, the, interstate, highway, system, monorails, in, particular, may, have, suffered, from, the, reluctance, of, public, transit, authorities, to, invest, in, the, perceived, high, cost, of, un, proven, technology, when, faced, with, cheaper, mature, alternatives, there, were, also, many, competing, monorail, technologies, splitting, their, case, further, one, notable, example, of, a, public, monorail, is, the, amf, monorail, that, was, used, as, transportation, around, the, 1964, 1965, world, s, fair, this, high, cost, perception, was, challenged, most, notably, in, 1963, when, the, alweg, consortium, proposed, to, finance, the, construction, of, a, major, system, in, los, angeles, county, california, in, return, for, the, right, of, operation, this, was, turned, down, by, the, los, angeles, county, board, of, supervisors, under, pressure, from, standard, oil, of, california, and, general, motors, which, were, strong, advocates, for, automobile, dependency, and, the, later, proposed, subway, system, faced, criticism, by, famed, author, ray, bradbury, as, it, had, yet, to, reach, the, scale, of, the, proposed, monorail, several, monorails, initially, conceived, as, transport, systems, survive, on, revenues, generated, from, tourism, benefiting, from, the, unique, views, offered, from, the, largely, elevated, installations, from, the, 1980s, most, monorail, mass, transit, systems, are, in, japan, with, a, few, exceptions, tokyo, monorail, is, one, of, the, world, s, busiest, averages, 127, 000, passengers, per, day, and, has, served, over, 1, 5, billion, passengers, since, 1964, china, recently, started, development, of, monorails, in, the, late, 2000s, already, home, to, the, world, s, largest, and, busiest, monorail, system, and, has, a, number, of, mass, transit, monorails, under, construction, in, several, of, cities, a, bombardier, innovia, monorail, based, system, is, under, construction, in, wuhu, and, several, cloudrail, systems, developed, by, byd, under, construction, a, number, of, cities, such, as, guang, an, liuzhou, bengbu, and, guilin, monorails, have, seen, continuing, use, in, niche, shuttle, markets, and, amusement, parks, modern, mass, transit, monorail, systems, use, developments, of, the, alweg, beam, and, tyre, approach, with, only, two, suspended, types, in, large, use, monorail, configurations, have, also, been, adopted, by, maglev, trains, since, the, 2000s, with, the, rise, of, traffic, congestion, and, urbanization, there, has, been, a, resurgence, of, interest, in, the, technology, for, public, transport, with, a, number, of, cities, such, as, malta, and, istanbul, today, investigating, monorails, as, a, possible, mass, transit, solution, in, 2004, chongqing, rail, transit, in, china, adopted, a, unique, alweg, based, design, with, rolling, stock, that, is, much, wider, than, most, monorails, with, capacity, comparable, to, heavy, rail, this, is, because, chongqing, is, criss, crossed, by, numerous, hills, mountains, and, rivers, therefore, tunneling, is, not, feasible, except, in, some, cases, for, example, lines, 1, and, 6, due, to, the, extreme, depth, involved, today, it, is, the, largest, and, busiest, monorail, system, in, the, world, s, o, paulo, brazil, is, building, two, high, capacity, monorail, lines, as, part, of, its, public, transportation, network, line, 15, was, partially, opened, in, 2014, will, be, 27, km, 17, mi, long, when, completed, in, 2022, and, has, a, capacity, of, 40, 000, pphpd, using, bombardier, innovia, monorail, trains, line, 17, will, be, 17, 7, km, 11, 0, mi, long, and, is, using, the, byd, skyrail, design, other, significant, monorail, systems, are, under, construction, such, as, two, lines, for, the, cairo, monorail, two, lines, for, the, mrt, bangkok, and, the, skyrail, bahia, in, brazil, modern, monorails, depend, on, a, large, solid, beam, as, the, vehicles, running, surface, there, are, a, number, of, competing, designs, divided, into, two, broad, classes, straddle, beam, and, suspended, monorails, the, most, common, type, is, the, straddle, beam, in, which, the, train, straddles, a, steel, or, reinforced, concrete, beam, 2, to, 3, feet, 0, 6, to, 0, 9, m, wide, a, rubber, tired, carriage, contacts, the, beam, on, the, top, and, both, sides, for, traction, and, to, stabilize, the, vehicle, the, style, was, popularized, by, the, german, company, alweg, there, is, also, a, historical, type, of, suspension, monorail, developed, by, german, inventors, nicolaus, otto, and, eugen, langen, in, the, 1880s, it, was, built, in, the, twin, cities, of, barmen, and, elberfeld, in, wuppertal, germany, opened, in, 1901, and, is, still, in, operation, the, chiba, urban, monorail, is, the, world, s, largest, suspended, network, almost, all, modern, monorails, are, powered, by, electric, motors, fed, by, dual, third, rails, contact, wires, or, electrified, channels, attached, to, or, enclosed, in, their, guidance, beams, but, diesel, powered, monorail, systems, also, exist, historically, some, systems, such, as, the, lartigue, monorail, used, steam, locomotives, magnetic, levitation, train, maglev, systems, such, as, the, german, transrapid, were, built, as, straddle, type, monorails, the, shanghai, maglev, train, runs, in, commercial, operation, at, 430, km, h, 270, mph, and, there, are, also, slower, maglev, monorails, intended, for, urban, transport, in, japan, linimo, korea, incheon, airport, maglev, and, china, beijing, subway, line, s1, and, the, changsha, maglev, express, however, it, is, argued, that, the, larger, width, of, the, guideway, for, the, maglevs, makes, it, not, legitimate, to, be, called, monorails, some, early, monorails, notably, the, suspended, monorail, at, wuppertal, germany, have, a, design, that, makes, it, difficult, to, switch, from, one, line, to, another, some, other, monorails, avoid, switching, as, much, as, possible, by, operating, in, a, continuous, loop, or, between, two, fixed, stations, as, in, the, seattle, center, monorail, current, monorails, are, capable, of, more, efficient, switching, than, in, the, past, with, suspended, monorails, switching, may, be, accomplished, by, moving, flanges, inside, the, beamway, to, shift, trains, to, one, line, or, another, straddle, beam, monorails, require, that, the, beam, moves, for, switching, which, was, an, almost, prohibitively, ponderous, procedure, now, the, most, common, way, of, achieving, this, is, to, place, a, moving, apparatus, on, top, of, a, sturdy, platform, capable, of, bearing, the, weight, of, vehicles, beams, and, its, own, mechanism, multiple, segmented, beams, move, into, place, on, rollers, to, smoothly, align, one, beam, with, another, to, send, the, train, in, its, desired, direction, with, the, design, originally, developed, by, alweg, capable, of, completing, a, switch, in, 12, seconds, some, of, these, beam, turnouts, are, quite, elaborate, capable, of, switching, between, several, beams, or, simulating, a, railroad, double, crossover, vehicle, specifications, are, generally, not, open, to, the, public, as, is, standard, for, rolling, stock, built, for, public, services, an, alternative, to, using, a, wye, or, other, form, of, switch, is, to, use, a, turntable, where, a, car, sits, upon, a, section, of, track, that, can, be, reoriented, to, several, different, tracks, for, example, this, can, be, used, to, switch, a, car, from, being, in, a, storage, location, to, being, on, the, main, line, the, now, closed, sydney, monorail, had, a, traverser, at, the, depot, which, allowed, a, train, on, the, main, line, to, be, exchanged, with, another, from, the, depot, there, were, about, six, lines, in, the, depot, including, one, for, maintenance, rubber, tired, monorails, are, typically, designed, to, cope, with, a, 6, grade, rubber, tired, light, rail, or, metro, lines, can, cope, with, similar, or, greater, grades, for, example, the, lausanne, metro, has, grades, of, up, to, 12, and, the, montreal, metro, up, to, 6, 5, while, val, systems, can, handle, 7, grades, manufacturers, of, monorail, rolling, stock, with, operating, systems, include, hitachi, monorail, byd, bombardier, transportation, now, alstom, pbts, a, joint, venture, of, crrc, nanjing, puzhen, bombardier, intamin, and, emtc,

purchases, a, faulty, monorail, from, a, confidence, trickster, at, a, wildly, inflated, price, the, monorail, society, an, organization, with, 14, 000, members, worldwide, has, blamed, the, episode, for, sullying, the, reputation, of, monorails, to, which, simpsons, creator, matt, groening, responded, that, s, a, by, product, of, our, viciousness, monorails, are, great, so, it, makes, me, sad,

than, passenger, transportation, small, suspended, monorail, are, also, widely, used, in, factories, either, as, part, of, moveable, assembly, lines, inspired, by, the, centennial, monorail, demonstrated, in, 1876, in, 1877, the, bradford, and, foster, brook, railway, began, construction, of, a, 5, mi, 8, 0, km, line, connecting, bradford, and, foster, township, mckean, county, in, pennsylvania, the, line, operated, from, 1878, until, 1879, delivering, machinery, and, oil, supplies, the, first, twin, boiler, locomotive, wore, out, quickly, it, was, replaced, by, a, single, boiler, locomotive, which, was, too, heavy, and, crashed, through, the, track, on, its, third, trip, the, third, locomotive, again, had, twin, boilers, on, a, trial, run, one, of, the, boilers, ran, dry, and, exploded, killing, six, people, the, railway, was, closed, soon, after, monorails, in, central, java, were, used, to, transport, timber, from, the, forests, of, central, java, located, in, the, mountains, to, the, rivers, in, 1908, and, 1909, the, forester, h, j, l, beck, built, a, manually, operated, monorail, of, limited, but, sufficient, capacity, for, the, transport, of, small, timber, and, firewood, in, the, northern, surabaya, forest, district, in, later, years, this, idea, was, further, developed, by, l, a, van, de, ven, who, was, a, forester, in, the, grobogan, forest, district, around, 1908, 1910, monorails, were, built, by, plantation, operators, and, wood, processing, companies, throughout, the, mountains, of, central, java, in, 1919, 1920, however, the, hand, operated, monorails, gradually, disappeared, and, were, replaced, by, narrow, gauge, railways, with, steam, locomotives, as, forest, utilization, changed, in, the, 1920s, the, port, of, hamburg, used, a, petrol, powered, suspended, monorail, to, transport, luggage, and, freight, from, ocean, going, vessels, to, a, passenger, depot, in, the, northern, mojave, desert, the, epsom, salts, monorail, was, built, in, 1924, it, ran, for, 28, miles, from, a, connection, on, the, trona, railway, eastward, to, harvest, epsomite, deposits, in, the, owlshead, mountains, this, lartigue, type, monorail,
