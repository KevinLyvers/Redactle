a, levee, l, v, i, or, l, v, e, dike, american, english, dyke, british, english, see, spelling, differences, embankment, floodbank, or, stop, bank, is, a, structure, used, to, keep, the, course, of, rivers, from, changing, and, to, protect, against, flooding, of, the, area, adjoining, the, river, or, coast, it, is, usually, earthen, and, often, runs, parallel, to, the, course, of, a, river, in, its, floodplain, or, along, low, lying, coastlines, levees, can, be, naturally, occurring, ridge, structures, that, form, next, to, the, bank, of, a, river, or, be, an, artificially, constructed, fill, or, wall, that, regulates, water, levels, however, levees, can, be, bad, for, the, environment, floodwalls, are, a, more, confined, alternative, ancient, civilizations, in, the, indus, valley, ancient, egypt, mesopotamia, and, china, all, built, levees, today, levees, can, be, found, around, the, world, and, failures, of, levees, due, to, erosion, or, other, causes, can, be, major, disasters, such, as, the, catastrophic, 2005, levee, failures, in, greater, new, orleans, that, occurred, as, a, result, of, hurricane, katrina, speakers, of, american, english, use, the, word, levee, from, the, french, word, lev, e, from, the, feminine, past, participle, of, the, french, verb, lever, to, raise, it, originated, in, new, orleans, a, few, years, after, the, city, s, founding, in, 1718, and, was, later, adopted, by, english, speakers, the, name, derives, from, the, trait, of, the, levee, s, ridges, being, raised, higher, than, both, the, channel, and, the, surrounding, floodplains, the, modern, word, dike, or, dyke, most, likely, derives, from, the, dutch, word, dijk, with, the, construction, of, dikes, well, attested, as, early, as, the, 11th, century, the, 126, kilometer, long, 78, mi, westfriese, omringdijk, completed, by, 1250, was, formed, by, connecting, existing, older, dikes, the, roman, chronicler, tacitus, mentions, that, the, rebellious, batavi, pierced, dikes, to, flood, their, land, and, to, protect, their, retreat, 70, ce, the, word, dijk, originally, indicated, both, the, trench, and, the, bank, it, closely, parallels, the, english, verb, to, dig, in, anglo, saxon, the, word, dic, already, existed, and, was, pronounced, as, dick, in, northern, england, and, as, ditch, in, the, south, similar, to, dutch, the, english, origins, of, the, word, lie, in, digging, a, trench, and, forming, the, upcast, soil, into, a, bank, alongside, it, this, practice, has, meant, that, the, name, may, be, given, to, either, the, excavation, or, to, the, bank, thus, offa, s, dyke, is, a, combined, structure, and, car, dyke, is, a, trench, though, it, once, had, raised, banks, as, well, in, the, english, midlands, and, east, anglia, and, in, the, united, states, a, dike, is, what, a, ditch, is, in, the, south, of, england, a, property, boundary, marker, or, drainage, channel, where, it, carries, a, stream, it, may, be, called, a, running, dike, as, in, rippingale, running, dike, which, leads, water, from, the, catchwater, drain, car, dyke, to, the, south, forty, foot, drain, in, lincolnshire, tf1427, the, weir, dike, is, a, soak, dike, in, bourne, north, fen, near, twenty, and, alongside, the, river, glen, lincolnshire, in, the, norfolk, and, suffolk, broads, a, dyke, may, be, a, drainage, ditch, or, a, narrow, artificial, channel, off, a, river, or, broad, for, access, or, mooring, some, longer, dykes, being, named, e, g, candle, dyke, in, parts, of, britain, particularly, scotland, and, northern, england, a, dyke, may, be, a, field, wall, generally, made, with, dry, stone, the, main, purpose, of, artificial, levees, is, to, prevent, flooding, of, the, adjoining, countryside, and, to, slow, natural, course, changes, in, a, waterway, to, provide, reliable, shipping, lanes, for, maritime, commerce, over, time, they, also, confine, the, flow, of, the, river, resulting, in, higher, and, faster, water, flow, levees, can, be, mainly, found, along, the, sea, where, dunes, are, not, strong, enough, along, rivers, for, protection, against, high, floods, along, lakes, or, along, polders, furthermore, levees, have, been, built, for, the, purpose, of, impoldering, or, as, a, boundary, for, an, inundation, area, the, latter, can, be, a, controlled, inundation, by, the, military, or, a, measure, to, prevent, inundation, of, a, larger, area, surrounded, by, levees, levees, have, also, been, built, as, field, boundaries, and, as, military, defences, more, on, this, type, of, levee, can, be, found, in, the, article, on, dry, stone, walls, levees, can, be, permanent, earthworks, or, emergency, constructions, often, of, sandbags, built, hastily, in, a, flood, emergency, some, of, the, earliest, levees, were, constructed, by, the, indus, valley, civilization, in, pakistan, and, north, india, from, c, 2600, bce, on, which, the, agrarian, life, of, the, harappan, peoples, depended, levees, were, also, constructed, over, 3, 000, years, ago, in, ancient, egypt, where, a, system, of, levees, was, built, along, the, left, bank, of, the, river, nile, for, more, than, 1, 000, kilometers, 600, miles, stretching, from, modern, aswan, to, the, nile, delta, on, the, shores, of, the, mediterranean, the, mesopotamian, civilizations, and, ancient, china, also, built, large, levee, systems, because, a, levee, is, only, as, strong, as, its, weakest, point, the, height, and, standards, of, construction, have, to, be, consistent, along, its, length, some, authorities, have, argued, that, this, requires, a, strong, governing, authority, to, guide, the, work, and, may, have, been, a, catalyst, for, the, development, of, systems, of, governance, in, early, civilizations, however, others, point, to, evidence, of, large, scale, water, control, earthen, works, such, as, canals, and, or, levees, dating, from, before, king, scorpion, in, predynastic, egypt, during, which, governance, was, far, less, centralized, another, example, of, a, historical, levee, that, protected, the, growing, city, state, of, m, xihco, ten, chtitlan, and, the, neighboring, city, of, tlatel, lco, was, constructed, during, the, early, 1400s, under, the, supervision, of, the, tlahtoani, of, the, altepetl, texcoco, nezahualcoyotl, its, function, was, to, separate, the, brackish, waters, of, lake, texcoco, ideal, for, the, agricultural, technique, chin, mitls, from, the, fresh, potable, water, supplied, to, the, settlements, however, after, the, europeans, destroyed, tenochtitlan, the, levee, was, also, destroyed, and, flooding, became, a, major, problem, which, resulted, in, the, majority, of, the, lake, being, drained, in, the, 17th, century, levees, are, usually, built, by, piling, earth, on, a, cleared, level, surface, broad, at, the, base, they, taper, to, a, level, top, where, temporary, embankments, or, sandbags, can, be, placed, because, flood, discharge, intensity, increases, in, levees, on, both, river, banks, and, because, silt, deposits, raise, the, level, of, riverbeds, planning, and, auxiliary, measures, are, vital, sections, are, often, set, back, from, the, river, to, form, a, wider, channel, and, flood, valley, basins, are, divided, by, multiple, levees, to, prevent, a, single, breach, from, flooding, a, large, area, a, levee, made, from, stones, laid, in, horizontal, rows, with, a, bed, of, thin, turf, between, each, of, them, is, known, as, a, spetchel, artificial, levees, require, substantial, engineering, their, surface, must, be, protected, from, erosion, so, they, are, planted, with, vegetation, such, as, bermuda, grass, in, order, to, bind, the, earth, together, on, the, land, side, of, high, levees, a, low, terrace, of, earth, known, as, a, banquette, is, usually, added, as, another, anti, erosion, measure, on, the, river, side, erosion, from, strong, waves, or, currents, presents, an, even, greater, threat, to, the, integrity, of, the, levee, the, effects, of, erosion, are, countered, by, planting, suitable, vegetation, or, installing, stones, boulders, weighted, matting, or, concrete, revetments, separate, ditches, or, drainage, tiles, are, constructed, to, ensure, that, the, foundation, does, not, become, waterlogged, prominent, levee, systems, have, been, built, along, the, mississippi, river, and, sacramento, river, in, the, united, states, and, the, po, rhine, meuse, river, rh, ne, loire, vistula, the, delta, formed, by, the, rhine, maas, meuse, and, scheldt, in, the, netherlands, and, the, danube, in, europe, during, the, chinese, warring, states, period, the, dujiangyan, irrigation, system, was, built, by, the, qin, as, a, water, conservation, and, flood, control, project, the, system, s, infrastructure, is, located, on, the, min, river, which, is, the, longest, tributary, of, the, yangtze, river, in, sichuan, china, the, mississippi, levee, system, represents, one, of, the, largest, such, systems, found, anywhere, in, the, world, it, comprises, over, 5, 600, km, 3, 500, mi, of, levees, extending, some, 1, 000, km, 620, mi, along, the, mississippi, stretching, from, cape, girardeau, missouri, to, the, mississippi, delta, they, were, begun, by, french, settlers, in, louisiana, in, the, 18th, century, to, protect, the, city, of, new, orleans, the, first, louisiana, levees, were, about, 90, cm, 3, ft, high, and, covered, a, distance, of, about, 80, km, 50, mi, along, the, riverside, the, u, s, army, corps, of, engineers, in, conjunction, with, the, mississippi, river, commission, extended, the, levee, system, beginning, in, 1882, to, cover, the, riverbanks, from, cairo, illinois, to, the, mouth, of, the, mississippi, delta, in, louisiana, by, the, mid, 1980s, they, had, reached, their, present, extent, and, averaged, 7, 3, m, 24, ft, in, height, some, mississippi, levees, are, as, high, as, 15, m, 50, ft, the, mississippi, levees, also, include, some, of, the, longest, continuous, individual, levees, in, the, world, one, such, levee, extends, southwards, from, pine, bluff, arkansas, for, a, distance, of, some, 610, km, 380, mi, the, scope, and, scale, of, the, mississippi, levees, has, often, been, compared, to, the, great, wall, of, china, the, united, states, army, corps, of, engineers, usace, recommends, and, supports, cellular, confinement, technology, geocells, as, a, best, management, practice, particular, attention, is, given, to, the, matter, of, surface, erosion, overtopping, prevention, and, protection, of, levee, crest, and, downstream, slope, reinforcement, with, geocells, provides, tensile, force, to, the, soil, to, better, resist, instability, artificial, levees, can, lead, to, an, elevation, of, the, natural, riverbed, over, time, whether, this, happens, or, not, and, how, fast, depends, on, different, factors, one, of, them, being, the, amount, and, type, of, the, bed, load, of, a, river, alluvial, rivers, with, intense, accumulations, of, sediment, tend, to, this, behavior, examples, of, rivers, where, artificial, levees, led, to, an, elevation, of, the, riverbed, even, up, to, a, point, where, the, riverbed, is, higher, than, the, adjacent, ground, surface, behind, the, levees, are, found, for, the, yellow, river, in, china, and, the, mississippi, in, the, united, states, levees, are, very, common, on, the, marshlands, bordering, the, bay, of, fundy, in, new, brunswick, and, nova, scotia, canada, the, acadians, who, settled, the, area, can, be, credited, with, the, original, construction, of, many, of, the, levees, in, the, area, created, for, the, purpose, of, farming, the, fertile, tidal, marshlands, these, levees, are, referred, to, as, dykes, they, are, constructed, with, hinged, sluice, gates, that, open, on, the, falling, tide, to, drain, freshwater, from, the, agricultural, marshlands, and, close, on, the, rising, tide, to, prevent, seawater, from, entering, behind, the, dyke, these, sluice, gates, are, called, aboiteaux, in, the, lower, mainland, around, the, city, of, vancouver, british, columbia, there, are, levees, known, locally, as, dikes, and, also, referred, to, as, the, sea, wall, to, protect, low, lying, land, in, the, fraser, river, delta, particularly, the, city, of, richmond, on, lulu, island, there, are, also, dikes, to, protect, other, locations, which, have, flooded, in, the, past, such, as, the, pitt, polder, land, adjacent, to, the, pitt, river, and, other, tributary, rivers, coastal, flood, prevention, levees, are, also, common, along, the, inland, coastline, behind, the, wadden, sea, an, area, devastated, by, many, historic, floods, thus, the, peoples, and, governments, have, erected, increasingly, large, and, complex, flood, protection, levee, systems, to, stop, the, sea, even, during, storm, floods, the, biggest, of, these, are, the, huge, levees, in, the, netherlands, which, have, gone, beyond, just, defending, against, floods, as, they, have, aggressively, taken, back, land, that, is, below, mean, sea, level, these, typically, man, made, hydraulic, structures, are, situated, to, protect, against, erosion, they, are, typically, placed, in, alluvial, rivers, perpendicular, or, at, an, angle, to, the, bank, of, the, channel, or, the, revetment, and, are, used, widely, along, coastlines, there, are, two, common, types, of, spur, dyke, permeable, and, impermeable, depending, on, the, materials, used, to, construct, them, natural, levees, commonly, form, around, lowland, rivers, and, creeks, without, human, intervention, they, are, elongated, ridges, of, mud, and, or, silt, that, form, on, the, river, floodplains, immediately, adjacent, to, the, cut, banks, like, artificial, levees, they, act, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, floodplain, inundation, deposition, of, levees, is, a, natural, consequence, of, the, flooding, of, meandering, rivers, which, carry, high, proportions, of, suspended, sediment, in, the, form, of, fine, sands, silts, and, muds, because, the, carrying, capacity, of, a, river, depends, in, part, on, its, depth, the, sediment, in, the, water, which, is, over, the, flooded, banks, of, the, channel, is, no, longer, capable, of, keeping, the, same, number, of, fine, sediments, in, suspension, as, the, main, thalweg, the, extra, fine, sediments, thus, settle, out, quickly, on, the, parts, of, the, floodplain, nearest, to, the, channel, over, a, significant, number, of, floods, this, will, eventually, result, in, the, building, up, of, ridges, in, these, positions, and, reducing, the, likelihood, of, further, floods, and, episodes, of, levee, building, if, aggradation, continues, to, occur, in, the, main, channel, this, will, make, levee, overtopping, more, likely, again, and, the, levees, can, continue, to, build, up, in, some, cases, this, can, result, in, the, channel, bed, eventually, rising, above, the, surrounding, floodplains, penned, in, only, by, the, levees, around, it, an, example, is, the, yellow, river, in, china, near, the, sea, where, oceangoing, ships, appear, to, sail, high, above, the, plain, on, the, elevated, river, levees, are, common, in, any, river, with, a, high, suspended, sediment, fraction, and, thus, are, intimately, associated, with, meandering, channels, which, also, are, more, likely, to, occur, where, a, river, carries, large, fractions, of, suspended, sediment, for, similar, reasons, they, are, also, common, in, tidal, creeks, where, tides, bring, in, large, amounts, of, coastal, silts, and, muds, high, spring, tides, will, cause, flooding, and, result, in, the, building, up, of, levees, both, natural, and, man, made, levees, can, fail, in, a, number, of, ways, factors, that, cause, levee, failure, include, overtopping, erosion, structural, failures, and, levee, saturation, the, most, frequent, and, dangerous, is, a, levee, breach, here, a, part, of, the, levee, actually, breaks, or, is, eroded, away, leaving, a, large, opening, for, water, to, flood, land, otherwise, protected, by, the, levee, a, breach, can, be, a, sudden, or, gradual, failure, caused, either, by, surface, erosion, or, by, subsurface, weakness, in, the, levee, a, breach, can, leave, a, fan, shaped, deposit, of, sediment, radiating, away, from, the, breach, described, as, a, crevasse, splay, in, natural, levees, once, a, breach, has, occurred, the, gap, in, the, levee, will, remain, until, it, is, again, filled, in, by, levee, building, processes, this, increases, the, chances, of, future, breaches, occurring, in, the, same, location, breaches, can, be, the, location, of, meander, cutoffs, if, the, river, flow, direction, is, permanently, diverted, through, the, gap, sometimes, levees, are, said, to, fail, when, water, overtops, the, crest, of, the, levee, this, will, cause, flooding, on, the, floodplains, but, because, it, does, not, damage, the, levee, it, has, fewer, consequences, for, future, flooding, among, various, failure, mechanisms, that, cause, levee, breaches, soil, erosion, is, found, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, factors, predicting, soil, erosion, and, scour, generation, when, overtopping, happens, is, important, in, order, to, design, stable, levee, and, floodwalls, there, have, been, numerous, studies, to, investigate, the, erodibility, of, soils, briaud, et, al, 2008, used, erosion, function, apparatus, efa, test, to, measure, the, erodibility, of, the, soils, and, afterwards, by, using, chen, 3d, software, numerical, simulations, were, performed, on, the, levee, to, find, out, the, velocity, vectors, in, the, overtopping, water, and, the, generated, scour, when, the, overtopping, water, impinges, the, levee, by, analyzing, the, results, from, efa, test, an, erosion, chart, to, categorize, erodibility, of, the, soils, was, developed, hughes, and, nadal, in, 2009, studied, the, effect, of, combination, of, wave, overtopping, and, storm, surge, overflow, on, the, erosion, and, scour, generation, in, levees, the, study, included, hydraulic, parameters, and, flow, characteristics, such, as, flow, thickness, wave, intervals, surge, level, above, levee, crown, in, analyzing, scour, development, according, to, the, laboratory, tests, empirical, correlations, related, to, average, overtopping, discharge, were, derived, to, analyze, the, resistance, of, levee, against, erosion, these, equations, could, only, fit, to, the, situation, similar, to, the, experimental, tests, while, they, can, give, a, reasonable, estimation, if, applied, to, other, conditions, osouli, et, al, 2014, and, karimpour, et, al, 2015, conducted, lab, scale, physical, modeling, of, levees, to, evaluate, score, characterization, of, different, levees, due, to, floodwall, overtopping, another, approach, applied, to, prevent, levee, failures, is, electrical, resistivity, tomography, ert, this, non, destructive, geophysical, method, can, detect, in, advance, critical, saturation, areas, in, embankments, ert, can, thus, be, used, in, monitoring, of, seepage, phenomena, in, earth, structures, and, act, as, an, early, warning, system, e, g, in, critical, parts, of, levees, or, embankments, large, scale, structures, designed, to, modify, natural, processes, inevitably, have, some, drawbacks, or, negative, impacts, levees, interrupt, floodplain, ecosystems, that, developed, under, conditions, of, seasonal, flooding, in, many, cases, the, impact, is, two, fold, as, reduced, recurrence, of, flooding, also, facilitates, land, use, change, from, forested, floodplain, to, farms, in, a, natural, watershed, floodwaters, spread, over, a, landscape, and, slowly, return, to, the, river, downstream, the, delivery, of, water, from, the, area, of, flooding, is, spread, out, in, time, if, levees, keep, the, floodwaters, inside, a, narrow, channel, the, water, is, delivered, downstream, over, a, shorter, time, period, the, same, volume, of, water, over, a, shorter, time, interval, means, higher, river, stage, height, as, more, levees, are, built, upstream, the, recurrence, interval, for, high, water, events, in, the, river, increases, often, requiring, increases, in, levee, height, during, natural, flooding, water, spilling, over, banks, rises, slowly, when, a, levee, fails, a, wall, of, water, held, back, by, the, levee, suddenly, pours, out, over, the, landscape, much, like, a, dam, break, impacted, areas, far, from, a, breach, may, experience, flooding, similar, to, a, natural, event, while, damage, near, a, breach, can, be, catastrophic, including, carving, out, deep, holes, and, channels, in, the, nearby, landscape, under, natural, conditions, floodwaters, return, quickly, to, the, river, channel, as, water, levels, drop, during, a, levee, breach, water, pours, out, into, the, floodplain, and, moves, down, slope, where, it, is, blocked, from, return, to, the, river, flooding, is, prolonged, over, such, areas, waiting, for, floodwater, to, slowly, infiltrate, and, evaporate, natural, flooding, adds, a, layer, of, sediment, to, the, floodplain, the, added, weight, of, such, layers, over, many, centuries, makes, the, crust, sink, deeper, into, the, mantle, much, like, a, floating, block, of, wood, is, pushed, deeper, into, the, water, if, another, board, is, added, on, top, the, momentum, of, downward, movement, does, not, immediately, stop, when, new, sediment, layers, stop, being, added, resulting, in, subsidence, sinking, of, land, surface, in, coastal, areas, this, results, in, land, dipping, below, sea, level, the, ocean, migrating, inland, and, salt, water, intruding, into, freshwater, aquifers, where, a, large, river, spills, out, into, the, ocean, the, velocity, of, the, water, suddenly, slows, and, its, ability, to, transport, sand, and, silt, decreases, sediments, begin, to, settle, out, eventually, forming, a, delta, and, extending, to, the, coastline, seaward, during, subsequent, flood, events, water, spilling, out, of, the, channel, will, find, a, shorter, route, to, the, ocean, and, begin, building, a, new, delta, wave, action, and, ocean, currents, redistribute, some, of, the, sediment, to, build, beaches, along, the, coast, when, levees, are, constructed, all, the, way, to, the, ocean, sediments, from, flooding, events, are, cut, off, the, river, never, migrates, and, elevated, river, velocity, delivers, sediment, to, deep, water, where, wave, action, and, ocean, currents, cannot, redistribute, instead, of, a, natural, wedge, shaped, delta, forming, a, birds, foot, delta, extends, far, out, into, the, ocean, the, results, for, surrounding, land, include, beach, depletion, subsidence, salt, water, intrusion, and, land, loss
