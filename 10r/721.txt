a, boat, is, a, watercraft, of, a, large, range, of, types, and, sizes, but, generally, smaller, than, a, ship, which, is, distinguished, by, its, larger, size, or, capacity, its, shape, or, its, ability, to, carry, boats, small, boats, are, typically, used, on, inland, waterways, such, as, rivers, and, lakes, or, in, protected, coastal, areas, however, some, boats, such, as, whaleboats, were, intended, for, offshore, use, in, modern, naval, terms, a, boat, is, a, vessel, small, enough, to, be, carried, aboard, a, ship, boats, vary, in, proportion, and, construction, methods, with, their, intended, purpose, available, materials, or, local, traditions, canoes, have, been, used, since, prehistoric, times, and, remain, in, use, throughout, the, world, for, transportation, fishing, and, sport, fishing, boats, vary, widely, in, style, partly, to, match, local, conditions, pleasure, craft, used, in, recreational, boating, include, ski, boats, pontoon, boats, and, sailboats, house, boats, may, be, used, for, vacationing, or, long, term, residence, lighters, are, used, to, move, cargo, to, and, from, large, ships, unable, to, get, close, to, shore, lifeboats, have, rescue, and, safety, functions, boats, can, be, propelled, by, manpower, e, g, rowboats, and, paddle, boats, wind, e, g, sailboats, and, inboard, outboard, motors, including, gasoline, diesel, and, electric, the, earliest, watercraft, are, considered, to, have, been, rafts, these, would, have, been, used, for, voyages, such, as, the, settlement, of, australia, sometime, between, 50, 000, and, 60, 000, years, ago, a, boat, differs, from, a, raft, by, obtaining, its, buoyancy, by, having, most, of, its, structure, exclude, water, with, a, waterproof, layer, e, g, the, planks, of, a, wooden, hull, the, hide, covering, or, tarred, canvas, of, a, currach, in, contrast, a, raft, is, buoyant, because, it, joins, together, components, that, are, themselves, buoyant, for, example, logs, bamboo, poles, bundles, of, reeds, floats, such, as, inflated, hides, sealed, pottery, containers, or, in, a, modern, context, empty, oil, drums, the, key, difference, between, a, raft, and, a, boat, is, that, the, former, is, a, flow, through, structure, with, waves, able, to, pass, up, through, it, consequently, except, for, short, river, crossings, a, raft, is, not, a, practical, means, of, transport, in, colder, regions, of, the, world, as, the, users, would, be, at, risk, of, hypothermia, today, that, climatic, limitation, restricts, rafts, to, between, 40, north, and, 40, south, with, in, the, past, similar, boundaries, that, have, moved, as, the, world, s, climate, has, varied, 11, the, earliest, boats, may, have, been, either, dugouts, or, hide, boats, 11, the, oldest, recovered, boat, in, the, world, the, pesse, canoe, found, in, the, netherlands, is, a, dugout, made, from, the, hollowed, tree, trunk, of, a, pinus, sylvestris, that, was, constructed, somewhere, between, 8200, and, 7600, bc, this, canoe, is, exhibited, in, the, drents, museum, in, assen, netherlands, other, very, old, dugout, boats, have, also, been, recovered, hide, boats, made, from, covering, a, framework, with, animal, skins, could, be, equally, as, old, as, logboats, but, such, a, structure, is, much, less, likely, to, survive, in, an, archaeological, context, ch, 4, northern, europe, plank, built, boats, are, considered, in, most, cases, to, have, developed, from, the, logboat, there, are, examples, of, logboats, that, have, been, expanded, by, deforming, the, hull, under, the, influence, of, heat, by, raising, up, the, sides, with, added, planks, or, by, splitting, down, the, middle, and, adding, a, central, plank, to, make, it, wider, some, of, these, methods, have, been, in, quite, recent, use, there, is, no, simple, developmental, sequence, the, earliest, known, plank, built, boats, are, from, the, nile, dating, to, the, third, millennium, bc, outside, egypt, the, next, earliest, are, from, england, the, ferriby, boats, are, dated, to, the, early, part, of, the, second, millennium, bc, and, the, end, of, the, third, millennium, ch, 4, northern, europe, mediterranean, region, plank, built, boats, require, a, level, of, woodworking, technology, that, was, first, available, in, the, neolithic, with, more, complex, versions, only, becoming, achievable, in, the, bronze, age, 59, boats, can, be, categorized, by, their, means, of, propulsion, these, divide, into, a, number, of, large, vessels, are, usually, referred, to, as, boats, submarines, are, a, prime, example, other, types, of, large, vessels, which, are, traditionally, called, boats, include, great, lakes, freighters, riverboats, and, ferryboats, though, large, enough, to, carry, their, own, boats, and, heavy, cargo, these, vessels, are, designed, for, operation, on, inland, or, protected, coastal, waters, the, hull, is, the, main, and, in, some, cases, only, structural, component, of, a, boat, it, provides, both, capacity, and, buoyancy, the, keel, is, a, boat, s, backbone, a, lengthwise, structural, member, to, which, the, perpendicular, frames, are, fixed, on, some, boats, a, deck, covers, the, hull, in, part, or, whole, while, a, ship, often, has, several, decks, a, boat, is, unlikely, to, have, more, than, one, above, the, deck, are, often, lifelines, connected, to, stanchions, bulwarks, perhaps, topped, by, gunnels, or, some, combination, of, the, two, a, cabin, may, protrude, above, the, deck, forward, aft, along, the, centerline, or, cover, much, of, the, length, of, the, boat, vertical, structures, dividing, the, internal, spaces, are, known, as, bulkheads, the, forward, end, of, a, boat, is, called, the, bow, the, aft, end, the, stern, facing, forward, the, right, side, is, referred, to, as, starboard, and, the, left, side, as, port, until, the, mid, 19th, century, most, boats, were, made, of, natural, materials, primarily, wood, although, bark, and, animal, skins, were, also, used, early, boats, include, the, birch, bark, canoe, the, animal, hide, covered, kayak, and, coracle, and, the, dugout, canoe, made, from, a, single, log, by, the, mid, 19th, century, some, boats, had, been, built, with, iron, or, steel, frames, but, still, planked, in, wood, in, 1855, ferro, cement, boat, construction, was, patented, by, the, french, who, coined, the, name, ferciment, this, is, a, system, by, which, a, steel, or, iron, wire, framework, is, built, in, the, shape, of, a, boat, s, hull, and, covered, over, with, cement, reinforced, with, bulkheads, and, other, internal, structures, it, is, strong, but, heavy, easily, repaired, and, if, sealed, properly, will, not, leak, or, corrode, as, the, forests, of, britain, and, europe, continued, to, be, over, harvested, to, supply, the, keels, of, larger, wooden, boats, and, the, bessemer, process, patented, in, 1855, cheapened, the, cost, of, steel, steel, ships, and, boats, began, to, be, more, common, by, the, 1930s, boats, built, entirely, of, steel, from, frames, to, plating, were, seen, replacing, wooden, boats, in, many, industrial, uses, and, fishing, fleets, private, recreational, boats, of, steel, remain, uncommon, in, 1895, wh, mullins, produced, steel, boats, of, galvanized, iron, and, by, 1930, became, the, world, s, largest, producer, of, pleasure, boats, mullins, also, offered, boats, in, aluminum, from, 1895, through, 1899, and, once, again, in, the, 1920s, but, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 20th, century, that, aluminium, gained, widespread, popularity, though, much, more, expensive, than, steel, aluminum, alloys, exist, that, do, not, corrode, in, salt, water, allowing, a, similar, load, carrying, capacity, to, steel, at, much, less, weight, around, the, mid, 1960s, boats, made, of, fiberglass, aka, glass, fiber, became, popular, especially, for, recreational, boats, fiberglass, is, also, known, as, grp, glass, reinforced, plastic, in, the, uk, and, frp, for, fiber, reinforced, plastic, in, the, us, fiberglass, boats, are, strong, and, do, not, rust, corrode, or, rot, instead, they, are, susceptible, to, structural, degradation, from, sunlight, and, extremes, in, temperature, over, their, lifespan, fiberglass, structures, can, be, made, stiffer, with, sandwich, panels, where, the, fiberglass, encloses, a, lightweight, core, such, as, balsa, or, foam, cold, molding, is, a, modern, construction, method, using, wood, as, the, structural, component, in, one, cold, molding, process, very, thin, strips, of, wood, are, layered, over, a, form, each, layer, is, coated, with, resin, followed, by, another, directionally, alternating, layer, laid, on, top, subsequent, layers, may, be, stapled, or, otherwise, mechanically, fastened, to, the, previous, or, weighted, or, vacuum, bagged, to, provide, compression, and, stabilization, until, the, resin, sets, an, alternative, process, uses, thin, sheets, of, plywood, shaped, over, a, disposable, male, mold, and, coated, with, epoxy, the, most, common, means, of, boat, propulsion, are, as, follows, a, boat, displaces, its, weight, in, water, regardless, whether, it, is, made, of, wood, steel, fiberglass, or, even, concrete, if, weight, is, added, to, the, boat, the, volume, of, the, hull, drawn, below, the, waterline, will, increase, to, keep, the, balance, above, and, below, the, surface, equal, boats, have, a, natural, or, designed, level, of, buoyancy, exceeding, it, will, cause, the, boat, first, to, ride, lower, in, the, water, second, to, take, on, water, more, readily, than, when, properly, loaded, and, ultimately, if, overloaded, by, any, combination, of, structure, cargo, and, water, sink, as, commercial, vessels, must, be, correctly, loaded, to, be, safe, and, as, the, sea, becomes, less, buoyant, in, brackish, areas, such, as, the, baltic, the, plimsoll, line, was, introduced, to, prevent, overloading, since, 1998, all, new, leisure, boats, and, barges, built, in, europe, between, 2, 5m, and, 24m, must, comply, with, the, eu, s, recreational, craft, directive, rcd, the, directive, establishes, four, categories, that, permit, the, allowable, wind, and, wave, conditions, for, vessels, in, each, class, europe, is, the, main, producer, of, recreational, boats, the, second, production, in, the, world, is, located, in, poland, european, brands, are, known, all, over, the, world, in, fact, these, are, the, brands, that, created, rcd, and, set, the, standard, for, shipyards, around, the, world
