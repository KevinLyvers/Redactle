a, simple, machine, is, a, mechanical, device, that, changes, the, direction, or, magnitude, of, a, force, in, general, they, can, be, defined, as, the, simplest, mechanisms, that, use, mechanical, advantage, also, called, leverage, to, multiply, force, usually, the, term, refers, to, the, six, classical, simple, machines, that, were, defined, by, renaissance, scientists, a, simple, machine, uses, a, single, applied, force, to, do, work, against, a, single, load, force, ignoring, friction, losses, the, work, done, on, the, load, is, equal, to, the, work, done, by, the, applied, force, the, machine, can, increase, the, amount, of, the, output, force, at, the, cost, of, a, proportional, decrease, in, the, distance, moved, by, the, load, the, ratio, of, the, output, to, the, applied, force, is, called, the, mechanical, advantage, simple, machines, can, be, regarded, as, the, elementary, building, blocks, of, which, all, more, complicated, machines, sometimes, called, compound, machines, are, composed, for, example, wheels, levers, and, pulleys, are, all, used, in, the, mechanism, of, a, bicycle, the, mechanical, advantage, of, a, compound, machine, is, just, the, product, of, the, mechanical, advantages, of, the, simple, machines, of, which, it, is, composed, although, they, continue, to, be, of, great, importance, in, mechanics, and, applied, science, modern, mechanics, has, moved, beyond, the, view, of, the, simple, machines, as, the, ultimate, building, blocks, of, which, all, machines, are, composed, which, arose, in, the, renaissance, as, a, neoclassical, amplification, of, ancient, greek, texts, the, great, variety, and, sophistication, of, modern, machine, linkages, which, arose, during, the, industrial, revolution, is, inadequately, described, by, these, six, simple, categories, various, post, renaissance, authors, have, compiled, expanded, lists, of, simple, machines, often, using, terms, like, basic, machines, compound, machines, or, machine, elements, to, distinguish, them, from, the, classical, simple, machines, above, by, the, late, 1800s, franz, reuleaux, had, identified, hundreds, of, machine, elements, calling, them, simple, machines, modern, machine, theory, analyzes, machines, as, kinematic, chains, composed, of, elementary, linkages, called, kinematic, pairs, the, idea, of, a, simple, machine, originated, with, the, greek, philosopher, archimedes, around, the, 3rd, century, bc, who, studied, the, archimedean, simple, machines, lever, pulley, and, screw, he, discovered, the, principle, of, mechanical, advantage, in, the, lever, archimedes, famous, remark, with, regard, to, the, lever, give, me, a, place, to, stand, on, and, i, will, move, the, earth, greek, expresses, his, realization, that, there, was, no, limit, to, the, amount, of, force, amplification, that, could, be, achieved, by, using, mechanical, advantage, later, greek, philosophers, defined, the, classic, five, simple, machines, excluding, the, inclined, plane, and, were, able, to, calculate, their, ideal, mechanical, advantage, for, example, heron, of, alexandria, c, 10, 75, ad, in, his, work, mechanics, lists, five, mechanisms, that, can, set, a, load, in, motion, lever, windlass, pulley, wedge, and, screw, and, describes, their, fabrication, and, uses, however, the, greeks, understanding, was, limited, to, the, statics, of, simple, machines, the, balance, of, forces, and, did, not, include, dynamics, the, tradeoff, between, force, and, distance, or, the, concept, of, work, during, the, renaissance, the, dynamics, of, the, mechanical, powers, as, the, simple, machines, were, called, began, to, be, studied, from, the, standpoint, of, how, far, they, could, lift, a, load, in, addition, to, the, force, they, could, apply, leading, eventually, to, the, new, concept, of, mechanical, work, in, 1586, flemish, engineer, simon, stevin, derived, the, mechanical, advantage, of, the, inclined, plane, and, it, was, included, with, the, other, simple, machines, the, complete, dynamic, theory, of, simple, machines, was, worked, out, by, italian, scientist, galileo, galilei, in, 1600, in, le, meccaniche, on, mechanics, in, which, he, showed, the, underlying, mathematical, similarity, of, the, machines, as, force, amplifiers, he, was, the, first, to, explain, that, simple, machines, do, not, create, energy, only, transform, it, the, classic, rules, of, sliding, friction, in, machines, were, discovered, by, leonardo, da, vinci, 1452, 1519, but, were, unpublished, and, merely, documented, in, his, notebooks, and, were, based, on, pre, newtonian, science, such, as, believing, friction, was, an, ethereal, fluid, they, were, rediscovered, by, guillaume, amontons, 1699, and, were, further, developed, by, charles, augustin, de, coulomb, 1785, if, a, simple, machine, does, not, dissipate, energy, through, friction, wear, or, deformation, then, energy, is, conserved, and, it, is, called, an, ideal, simple, machine, in, this, case, the, power, into, the, machine, equals, the, power, out, and, the, mechanical, advantage, can, be, calculated, from, its, geometric, dimensions, although, each, machine, works, differently, mechanically, the, way, they, function, is, similar, mathematically, in, each, machine, a, force, f, in, displaystyle, f, text, in, is, applied, to, the, device, at, one, point, and, it, does, work, moving, a, load, f, out, displaystyle, f, text, out, at, another, point, although, some, machines, only, change, the, direction, of, the, force, such, as, a, stationary, pulley, most, machines, multiply, the, magnitude, of, the, force, by, a, factor, the, mechanical, advantage, m, a, f, out, f, in, displaystyle, mathrm, ma, f, text, out, over, f, text, in, that, can, be, calculated, from, the, machine, s, geometry, and, friction, simple, machines, do, not, contain, a, source, of, energy, so, they, cannot, do, more, work, than, they, receive, from, the, input, force, a, simple, machine, with, no, friction, or, elasticity, is, called, an, ideal, machine, due, to, conservation, of, energy, in, an, ideal, simple, machine, the, power, output, rate, of, energy, output, at, any, time, p, out, displaystyle, p, text, out, is, equal, to, the, power, input, p, in, displaystyle, p, text, in, p, out, p, in, displaystyle, p, text, out, p, text, in, the, power, output, equals, the, velocity, of, the, load, v, out, displaystyle, v, text, out, multiplied, by, the, load, force, p, out, f, out, v, out, displaystyle, p, text, out, f, text, out, v, text, out, similarly, the, power, input, from, the, applied, force, is, equal, to, the, velocity, of, the, input, point, v, in, displaystyle, v, text, in, multiplied, by, the, applied, force, p, in, f, in, v, in, displaystyle, p, text, in, f, text, in, v, text, in, therefore, f, out, v, out, f, in, v, in, displaystyle, f, text, out, v, text, out, f, text, in, v, text, in, so, the, mechanical, advantage, of, an, ideal, machine, m, a, ideal, displaystyle, mathrm, ma, text, ideal, is, equal, to, the, velocity, ratio, the, ratio, of, input, velocity, to, output, velocity, m, a, ideal, f, out, f, in, v, in, v, out, displaystyle, mathrm, ma, text, ideal, f, text, out, over, f, text, in, v, text, in, over, v, text, out, the, velocity, ratio, is, also, equal, to, the, ratio, of, the, distances, covered, in, any, given, period, of, time, v, out, v, in, d, out, d, in, displaystyle, v, text, out, over, v, text, in, d, text, out, over, d, text, in, therefore, the, mechanical, advantage, of, an, ideal, machine, is, also, equal, to, the, distance, ratio, the, ratio, of, input, distance, moved, to, output, distance, moved, m, a, ideal, f, out, f, in, d, in, d, out, displaystyle, mathrm, ma, text, ideal, f, text, out, over, f, text, in, d, text, in, over, d, text, out, this, can, be, calculated, from, the, geometry, of, the, machine, for, example, the, mechanical, advantage, and, distance, ratio, of, the, lever, is, equal, to, the, ratio, of, its, lever, arms, the, mechanical, advantage, can, be, greater, or, less, than, one, in, the, screw, which, uses, rotational, motion, the, input, force, should, be, replaced, by, the, torque, and, the, velocity, by, the, angular, velocity, the, shaft, is, turned, all, real, machines, have, friction, which, causes, some, of, the, input, power, to, be, dissipated, as, heat, if, p, fric, displaystyle, p, text, fric, is, the, power, lost, to, friction, from, conservation, of, energy, p, in, p, out, p, fric, displaystyle, p, text, in, p, text, out, p, text, fric, the, mechanical, efficiency, displaystyle, eta, of, a, machine, where, 0, 1, displaystyle, 0, eta, 1, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, power, out, to, the, power, in, and, is, a, measure, of, the, frictional, energy, losses, p, out, p, in, p, out, p, in, displaystyle, begin, aligned, eta, equiv, p, text, out, over, p, text, in, p, text, out, eta, p, text, in, end, aligned, as, above, the, power, is, equal, to, the, product, of, force, and, velocity, so, f, out, v, out, f, in, v, in, displaystyle, f, text, out, v, text, out, eta, f, text, in, v, text, in, therefore, m, a, f, out, f, in, v, in, v, out, displaystyle, mathrm, ma, f, text, out, over, f, text, in, eta, v, text, in, over, v, text, out, so, in, non, ideal, machines, the, mechanical, advantage, is, always, less, than, the, velocity, ratio, by, the, product, with, the, efficiency, displaystyle, eta, so, a, machine, that, includes, friction, will, not, be, able, to, move, as, large, a, load, as, a, corresponding, ideal, machine, using, the, same, input, force, a, compound, machine, is, a, machine, formed, from, a, set, of, simple, machines, connected, in, series, with, the, output, force, of, one, providing, the, input, force, to, the, next, for, example, a, bench, vise, consists, of, a, lever, the, vise, s, handle, in, series, with, a, screw, and, a, simple, gear, train, consists, of, a, number, of, gears, wheels, and, axles, connected, in, series, the, mechanical, advantage, of, a, compound, machine, is, the, ratio, of, the, output, force, exerted, by, the, last, machine, in, the, series, divided, by, the, input, force, applied, to, the, first, machine, that, is, m, a, compound, f, out, n, f, in1, displaystyle, mathrm, ma, text, compound, f, text, out, n, over, f, text, in1, because, the, output, force, of, each, machine, is, the, input, of, the, next, f, out1, f, in2, f, out2, f, in3, f, out, k, f, in, k, 1, displaystyle, f, text, out1, f, text, in2, f, text, out2, f, text, in3, ldots, f, text, out, k, f, text, in, k, 1, this, mechanical, advantage, is, also, given, by, m, a, compound, f, out1, f, in1, f, out2, f, in2, f, out3, f, in3, f, out, n, f, in, n, displaystyle, mathrm, ma, text, compound, f, text, out1, over, f, text, in1, f, text, out2, over, f, text, in2, f, text, out3, over, f, text, in3, ldots, f, text, out, n, over, f, text, in, n, thus, the, mechanical, advantage, of, the, compound, machine, is, equal, to, the, product, of, the, mechanical, advantages, of, the, series, of, simple, machines, that, form, it, m, a, compound, m, a, 1, m, a, 2, m, a, n, displaystyle, mathrm, ma, text, compound, mathrm, ma, 1, mathrm, ma, 2, ldots, mathrm, ma, n, similarly, the, efficiency, of, a, compound, machine, is, also, the, product, of, the, efficiencies, of, the, series, of, simple, machines, that, form, it, compound, 1, 2, n, displaystyle, eta, text, compound, eta, 1, eta, 2, ldots, eta, n, in, many, simple, machines, if, the, load, force, f, out, displaystyle, f, textrm, out, on, the, machine, is, high, enough, in, relation, to, the, input, force, f, in, displaystyle, f, textrm, in, the, machine, will, move, backwards, with, the, load, force, doing, work, on, the, input, force, so, these, machines, can, be, used, in, either, direction, with, the, driving, force, applied, to, either, input, point, for, example, if, the, load, force, on, a, lever, is, high, enough, the, lever, will, move, backwards, moving, the, input, arm, backwards, against, the, input, force, these, are, called, reversible, non, locking, or, overhauling, machines, and, the, backward, motion, is, called, overhauling, however, in, some, machines, if, the, frictional, forces, are, high, enough, no, amount, of, load, force, can, move, it, backwards, even, if, the, input, force, is, zero, this, is, called, a, self, locking, nonreversible, or, non, overhauling, machine, these, machines, can, only, be, set, in, motion, by, a, force, at, the, input, and, when, the, input, force, is, removed, will, remain, motionless, locked, by, friction, at, whatever, position, they, were, left, self, locking, occurs, mainly, in, those, machines, with, large, areas, of, sliding, contact, between, moving, parts, the, screw, inclined, plane, and, wedge, a, machine, will, be, self, locking, if, and, only, if, its, efficiency, displaystyle, eta, is, below, 50, f, out, f, in, d, in, d, out, 0, 5, displaystyle, eta, equiv, frac, f, text, out, f, text, in, d, text, in, d, text, out, 0, 5, whether, a, machine, is, self, locking, depends, on, both, the, friction, forces, coefficient, of, static, friction, between, its, parts, and, the, distance, ratio, d, in, d, out, displaystyle, d, textrm, in, d, textrm, out, ideal, mechanical, advantage, if, both, the, friction, and, ideal, mechanical, advantage, are, high, enough, it, will, self, lock, when, a, machine, moves, in, the, forward, direction, from, point, 1, to, point, 2, with, the, input, force, doing, work, on, a, load, force, from, conservation, of, energy, the, input, work, w, 1, 2, displaystyle, w, text, 1, 2, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, the, work, done, on, the, load, force, w, load, displaystyle, w, text, load, and, the, work, lost, to, friction, w, fric, displaystyle, w, text, fric, if, the, efficiency, is, below, 50, w, load, w, 1, 2, 0, 5, displaystyle, eta, w, text, load, w, text, 1, 2, 0, 5, 2, w, load, w, 1, 2, displaystyle, 2w, text, load, w, text, 1, 2, from, eq, 1, 2, w, load, w, load, w, fric, w, load, w, fric, displaystyle, begin, aligned, 2w, text, load, w, text, load, w, text, fric, w, text, load, w, text, fric, end, aligned, when, the, machine, moves, backward, from, point, 2, to, point, 1, with, the, load, force, doing, work, on, the, input, force, the, work, lost, to, friction, w, fric, displaystyle, w, text, fric, is, the, same, w, load, w, 2, 1, w, fric, displaystyle, w, text, load, w, text, 2, 1, w, text, fric, so, the, output, work, is, w, 2, 1, w, load, w, fric, 0, displaystyle, w, text, 2, 1, w, text, load, w, text, fric, 0, thus, the, machine, self, locks, because, the, work, dissipated, in, friction, is, greater, than, the, work, done, by, the, load, force, moving, it, backwards, even, with, no, input, force, machines, are, studied, as, mechanical, systems, consisting, of, actuators, and, mechanisms, that, transmit, forces, and, movement, monitored, by, sensors, and, controllers, the, components, of, actuators, and, mechanisms, consist, of, links, and, joints, that, form, kinematic, chains, simple, machines, are, elementary, examples, of, kinematic, chains, that, are, used, to, model, mechanical, systems, ranging, from, the, steam, engine, to, robot, manipulators, the, bearings, that, form, the, fulcrum, of, a, lever, and, that, allow, the, wheel, and, axle, and, pulleys, to, rotate, are, examples, of, a, kinematic, pair, called, a, hinged, joint, similarly, the, flat, surface, of, an, inclined, plane, and, wedge, are, examples, of, the, kinematic, pair, called, a, sliding, joint, the, screw, is, usually, identified, as, its, own, kinematic, pair, called, a, helical, joint, two, levers, or, cranks, are, combined, into, a, planar, four, bar, linkage, by, attaching, a, link, that, connects, the, output, of, one, crank, to, the, input, of, another, additional, links, can, be, attached, to, form, a, six, bar, linkage, or, in, series, to, form, a, robot, the, identification, of, simple, machines, arises, from, a, desire, for, a, systematic, method, to, invent, new, machines, therefore, an, important, concern, is, how, simple, machines, are, combined, to, make, more, complex, machines, one, approach, is, to, attach, simple, machines, in, series, to, obtain, compound, machines, however, a, more, successful, strategy, was, identified, by, franz, reuleaux, who, collected, and, studied, over, 800, elementary, machines, he, realized, that, a, lever, pulley, and, wheel, and, axle, are, in, essence, the, same, device, a, body, rotating, about, a, hinge, similarly, an, inclined, plane, wedge, and, screw, are, a, block, sliding, on, a, flat, surface, this, realization, shows, that, it, is, the, joints, or, the, connections, that, provide, movement, that, are, the, primary, elements, of, a, machine, starting, with, four, types, of, joints, the, revolute, joint, sliding, joint, cam, joint, and, gear, joint, and, related, connections, such, as, cables, and, belts, it, is, possible, to, understand, a, machine, as, an, assembly, of, solid, parts, that, connect, these, joints, the, design, of, mechanisms, to, perform, required, movement, and, force, transmission, is, known, as, kinematic, synthesis, this, is, a, collection, of, geometric, techniques, for, the, mechanical, design, of, linkages, cam, and, follower, mechanisms, and, gears, and, gear, trains
