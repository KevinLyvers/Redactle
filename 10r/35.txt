genetic, engineering, also, called, genetic, modification, or, genetic, manipulation, is, the, modification, and, manipulation, of, an, organism, s, genes, using, technology, it, is, a, set, of, technologies, used, to, change, the, genetic, makeup, of, cells, including, the, transfer, of, genes, within, and, across, species, boundaries, to, produce, improved, or, novel, organisms, new, dna, is, obtained, by, either, isolating, and, copying, the, genetic, material, of, interest, using, recombinant, dna, methods, or, by, artificially, synthesising, the, dna, a, construct, is, usually, created, and, used, to, insert, this, dna, into, the, host, organism, the, first, recombinant, dna, molecule, was, made, by, paul, berg, in, 1972, by, combining, dna, from, the, monkey, virus, sv40, with, the, lambda, virus, as, well, as, inserting, genes, the, process, can, be, used, to, remove, or, knock, out, genes, the, new, dna, can, be, inserted, randomly, or, targeted, to, a, specific, part, of, the, genome, an, organism, that, is, generated, through, genetic, engineering, is, considered, to, be, genetically, modified, gm, and, the, resulting, entity, is, a, genetically, modified, organism, gmo, the, first, gmo, was, a, bacterium, generated, by, herbert, boyer, and, stanley, cohen, in, 1973, rudolf, jaenisch, created, the, first, gm, animal, when, he, inserted, foreign, dna, into, a, mouse, in, 1974, the, first, company, to, focus, on, genetic, engineering, genentech, was, founded, in, 1976, and, started, the, production, of, human, proteins, genetically, engineered, human, insulin, was, produced, in, 1978, and, insulin, producing, bacteria, were, commercialised, in, 1982, genetically, modified, food, has, been, sold, since, 1994, with, the, release, of, the, flavr, savr, tomato, the, flavr, savr, was, engineered, to, have, a, longer, shelf, life, but, most, current, gm, crops, are, modified, to, increase, resistance, to, insects, and, herbicides, glofish, the, first, gmo, designed, as, a, pet, was, sold, in, the, united, states, in, december, 2003, in, 2016, salmon, modified, with, a, growth, hormone, were, sold, genetic, engineering, has, been, applied, in, numerous, fields, including, research, medicine, industrial, biotechnology, and, agriculture, in, research, gmos, are, used, to, study, gene, function, and, expression, through, loss, of, function, gain, of, function, tracking, and, expression, experiments, by, knocking, out, genes, responsible, for, certain, conditions, it, is, possible, to, create, animal, model, organisms, of, human, diseases, as, well, as, producing, hormones, vaccines, and, other, drugs, genetic, engineering, has, the, potential, to, cure, genetic, diseases, through, gene, therapy, chinese, hamster, ovary, cho, cells, are, used, in, industrial, genetic, engineering, additionally, mrna, vaccines, are, made, through, genetic, engineering, to, treat, viruses, such, as, covid, 19, the, same, techniques, that, are, used, to, produce, drugs, can, also, have, industrial, applications, such, as, producing, enzymes, for, laundry, detergent, cheeses, and, other, products, the, rise, of, commercialised, genetically, modified, crops, has, provided, economic, benefit, to, farmers, in, many, different, countries, but, has, also, been, the, source, of, most, of, the, controversy, surrounding, the, technology, this, has, been, present, since, its, early, use, the, first, field, trials, were, destroyed, by, anti, gm, activists, although, there, is, a, scientific, consensus, that, currently, available, food, derived, from, gm, crops, poses, no, greater, risk, to, human, health, than, conventional, food, critics, consider, gm, food, safety, a, leading, concern, gene, flow, impact, on, non, target, organisms, control, of, the, food, supply, and, intellectual, property, rights, have, also, been, raised, as, potential, issues, these, concerns, have, led, to, the, development, of, a, regulatory, framework, which, started, in, 1975, it, has, led, to, an, international, treaty, the, cartagena, protocol, on, biosafety, that, was, adopted, in, 2000, individual, countries, have, developed, their, own, regulatory, systems, regarding, gmos, with, the, most, marked, differences, occurring, between, the, united, states, and, europe, genetic, engineering, process, of, inserting, new, genetic, information, into, existing, cells, in, order, to, modify, a, specific, organism, for, the, purpose, of, changing, its, characteristics, note, adapted, from, ref, genetic, engineering, is, a, process, that, alters, the, genetic, structure, of, an, organism, by, either, removing, or, introducing, dna, or, modifying, existing, genetic, material, in, situ, unlike, traditional, animal, and, plant, breeding, which, involves, doing, multiple, crosses, and, then, selecting, for, the, organism, with, the, desired, phenotype, genetic, engineering, takes, the, gene, directly, from, one, organism, and, delivers, it, to, the, other, this, is, much, faster, can, be, used, to, insert, any, genes, from, any, organism, even, ones, from, different, domains, and, prevents, other, undesirable, genes, from, also, being, added, genetic, engineering, could, potentially, fix, severe, genetic, disorders, in, humans, by, replacing, the, defective, gene, with, a, functioning, one, it, is, an, important, tool, in, research, that, allows, the, function, of, specific, genes, to, be, studied, drugs, vaccines, and, other, products, have, been, harvested, from, organisms, engineered, to, produce, them, crops, have, been, developed, that, aid, food, security, by, increasing, yield, nutritional, value, and, tolerance, to, environmental, stresses, the, dna, can, be, introduced, directly, into, the, host, organism, or, into, a, cell, that, is, then, fused, or, hybridised, with, the, host, this, relies, on, recombinant, nucleic, acid, techniques, to, form, new, combinations, of, heritable, genetic, material, followed, by, the, incorporation, of, that, material, either, indirectly, through, a, vector, system, or, directly, through, micro, injection, macro, injection, or, micro, encapsulation, genetic, engineering, does, not, normally, include, traditional, breeding, in, vitro, fertilisation, induction, of, polyploidy, mutagenesis, and, cell, fusion, techniques, that, do, not, use, recombinant, nucleic, acids, or, a, genetically, modified, organism, in, the, process, however, some, broad, definitions, of, genetic, engineering, include, selective, breeding, cloning, and, stem, cell, research, although, not, considered, genetic, engineering, are, closely, related, and, genetic, engineering, can, be, used, within, them, synthetic, biology, is, an, emerging, discipline, that, takes, genetic, engineering, a, step, further, by, introducing, artificially, synthesised, material, into, an, organism, plants, animals, or, microorganisms, that, have, been, changed, through, genetic, engineering, are, termed, genetically, modified, organisms, or, gmos, if, genetic, material, from, another, species, is, added, to, the, host, the, resulting, organism, is, called, transgenic, if, genetic, material, from, the, same, species, or, a, species, that, can, naturally, breed, with, the, host, is, used, the, resulting, organism, is, called, cisgenic, if, genetic, engineering, is, used, to, remove, genetic, material, from, the, target, organism, the, resulting, organism, is, termed, a, knockout, organism, in, europe, genetic, modification, is, synonymous, with, genetic, engineering, while, within, the, united, states, of, america, and, canada, genetic, modification, can, also, be, used, to, refer, to, more, conventional, breeding, methods, humans, have, altered, the, genomes, of, species, for, thousands, of, years, through, selective, breeding, or, artificial, selection, 1, 1, as, contrasted, with, natural, selection, more, recently, mutation, breeding, has, used, exposure, to, chemicals, or, radiation, to, produce, a, high, frequency, of, random, mutations, for, selective, breeding, purposes, genetic, engineering, as, the, direct, manipulation, of, dna, by, humans, outside, breeding, and, mutations, has, only, existed, since, the, 1970s, the, term, genetic, engineering, was, coined, by, the, russian, born, geneticist, nikolay, timofeev, ressovsky, in, his, 1934, paper, the, experimental, production, of, mutations, published, in, the, british, journal, biological, reviews, jack, williamson, used, the, term, in, his, science, fiction, novel, dragon, s, island, published, in, 1951, one, year, before, dna, s, role, in, heredity, was, confirmed, by, alfred, hershey, and, martha, chase, and, two, years, before, james, watson, and, francis, crick, showed, that, the, dna, molecule, has, a, double, helix, structure, though, the, general, concept, of, direct, genetic, manipulation, was, explored, in, rudimentary, form, in, stanley, g, weinbaum, s, 1936, science, fiction, story, proteus, island, in, 1972, paul, berg, created, the, first, recombinant, dna, molecules, by, combining, dna, from, the, monkey, virus, sv40, with, that, of, the, lambda, virus, in, 1973, herbert, boyer, and, stanley, cohen, created, the, first, transgenic, organism, by, inserting, antibiotic, resistance, genes, into, the, plasmid, of, an, escherichia, coli, bacterium, a, year, later, rudolf, jaenisch, created, a, transgenic, mouse, by, introducing, foreign, dna, into, its, embryo, making, it, the, world, s, first, transgenic, animal, these, achievements, led, to, concerns, in, the, scientific, community, about, potential, risks, from, genetic, engineering, which, were, first, discussed, in, depth, at, the, asilomar, conference, in, 1975, one, of, the, main, recommendations, from, this, meeting, was, that, government, oversight, of, recombinant, dna, research, should, be, established, until, the, technology, was, deemed, safe, in, 1976, genentech, the, first, genetic, engineering, company, was, founded, by, herbert, boyer, and, robert, swanson, and, a, year, later, the, company, produced, a, human, protein, somatostatin, in, e, coli, genentech, announced, the, production, of, genetically, engineered, human, insulin, in, 1978, in, 1980, the, u, s, supreme, court, in, the, diamond, v, chakrabarty, case, ruled, that, genetically, altered, life, could, be, patented, the, insulin, produced, by, bacteria, was, approved, for, release, by, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, in, 1982, in, 1983, a, biotech, company, advanced, genetic, sciences, ags, applied, for, u, s, government, authorisation, to, perform, field, tests, with, the, ice, minus, strain, of, pseudomonas, syringae, to, protect, crops, from, frost, but, environmental, groups, and, protestors, delayed, the, field, tests, for, four, years, with, legal, challenges, in, 1987, the, ice, minus, strain, of, p, syringae, became, the, first, genetically, modified, organism, gmo, to, be, released, into, the, environment, when, a, strawberry, field, and, a, potato, field, in, california, were, sprayed, with, it, both, test, fields, were, attacked, by, activist, groups, the, night, before, the, tests, occurred, the, world, s, first, trial, site, attracted, the, world, s, first, field, trasher, the, first, field, trials, of, genetically, engineered, plants, occurred, in, france, and, the, us, in, 1986, tobacco, plants, were, engineered, to, be, resistant, to, herbicides, the, people, s, republic, of, china, was, the, first, country, to, commercialise, transgenic, plants, introducing, a, virus, resistant, tobacco, in, 1992, in, 1994, calgene, attained, approval, to, commercially, release, the, first, genetically, modified, food, the, flavr, savr, a, tomato, engineered, to, have, a, longer, shelf, life, in, 1994, the, european, union, approved, tobacco, engineered, to, be, resistant, to, the, herbicide, bromoxynil, making, it, the, first, genetically, engineered, crop, commercialised, in, europe, in, 1995, bt, potato, was, approved, safe, by, the, environmental, protection, agency, after, having, been, approved, by, the, fda, making, it, the, first, pesticide, producing, crop, to, be, approved, in, the, us, in, 2009, 11, transgenic, crops, were, grown, commercially, in, 25, countries, the, largest, of, which, by, area, grown, were, the, us, brazil, argentina, india, canada, china, paraguay, and, south, africa, in, 2010, scientists, at, the, j, craig, venter, institute, created, the, first, synthetic, genome, and, inserted, it, into, an, empty, bacterial, cell, the, resulting, bacterium, named, mycoplasma, laboratorium, could, replicate, and, produce, proteins, four, years, later, this, was, taken, a, step, further, when, a, bacterium, was, developed, that, replicated, a, plasmid, containing, a, unique, base, pair, creating, the, first, organism, engineered, to, use, an, expanded, genetic, alphabet, in, 2012, jennifer, doudna, and, emmanuelle, charpentier, collaborated, to, develop, the, crispr, cas9, system, a, technique, which, can, be, used, to, easily, and, specifically, alter, the, genome, of, almost, any, organism, creating, a, gmo, is, a, multi, step, process, genetic, engineers, must, first, choose, what, gene, they, wish, to, insert, into, the, organism, this, is, driven, by, what, the, aim, is, for, the, resultant, organism, and, is, built, on, earlier, research, genetic, screens, can, be, carried, out, to, determine, potential, genes, and, further, tests, then, used, to, identify, the, best, candidates, the, development, of, microarrays, transcriptomics, and, genome, sequencing, has, made, it, much, easier, to, find, suitable, genes, luck, also, plays, its, part, the, roundup, ready, gene, was, discovered, after, scientists, noticed, a, bacterium, thriving, in, the, presence, of, the, herbicide, the, next, step, is, to, isolate, the, candidate, gene, the, cell, containing, the, gene, is, opened, and, the, dna, is, purified, the, gene, is, separated, by, using, restriction, enzymes, to, cut, the, dna, into, fragments, or, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, to, amplify, up, the, gene, segment, these, segments, can, then, be, extracted, through, gel, electrophoresis, if, the, chosen, gene, or, the, donor, organism, s, genome, has, been, well, studied, it, may, already, be, accessible, from, a, genetic, library, if, the, dna, sequence, is, known, but, no, copies, of, the, gene, are, available, it, can, also, be, artificially, synthesised, once, isolated, the, gene, is, ligated, into, a, plasmid, that, is, then, inserted, into, a, bacterium, the, plasmid, is, replicated, when, the, bacteria, divide, ensuring, unlimited, copies, of, the, gene, are, available, the, rk2, plasmid, is, notable, for, its, ability, to, replicate, in, a, wide, variety, of, single, celled, organisms, which, makes, it, suitable, as, a, genetic, engineering, tool, before, the, gene, is, inserted, into, the, target, organism, it, must, be, combined, with, other, genetic, elements, these, include, a, promoter, and, terminator, region, which, initiate, and, end, transcription, a, selectable, marker, gene, is, added, which, in, most, cases, confers, antibiotic, resistance, so, researchers, can, easily, determine, which, cells, have, been, successfully, transformed, the, gene, can, also, be, modified, at, this, stage, for, better, expression, or, effectiveness, these, manipulations, are, carried, out, using, recombinant, dna, techniques, such, as, restriction, digests, ligations, and, molecular, cloning, there, are, a, number, of, techniques, used, to, insert, genetic, material, into, the, host, genome, some, bacteria, can, naturally, take, up, foreign, dna, this, ability, can, be, induced, in, other, bacteria, via, stress, e, g, thermal, or, electric, shock, which, increases, the, cell, membrane, s, permeability, to, dna, up, taken, dna, can, either, integrate, with, the, genome, or, exist, as, extrachromosomal, dna, dna, is, generally, inserted, into, animal, cells, using, microinjection, where, it, can, be, injected, through, the, cell, s, nuclear, envelope, directly, into, the, nucleus, or, through, the, use, of, viral, vectors, plant, genomes, can, be, engineered, by, physical, methods, or, by, use, of, agrobacterium, for, the, delivery, of, sequences, hosted, in, t, dna, binary, vectors, in, plants, the, dna, is, often, inserted, using, agrobacterium, mediated, transformation, taking, advantage, of, the, agrobacterium, s, t, dna, sequence, that, allows, natural, insertion, of, genetic, material, into, plant, cells, other, methods, include, biolistics, where, particles, of, gold, or, tungsten, are, coated, with, dna, and, then, shot, into, young, plant, cells, and, electroporation, which, involves, using, an, electric, shock, to, make, the, cell, membrane, permeable, to, plasmid, dna, as, only, a, single, cell, is, transformed, with, genetic, material, the, organism, must, be, regenerated, from, that, single, cell, in, plants, this, is, accomplished, through, the, use, of, tissue, culture, in, animals, it, is, necessary, to, ensure, that, the, inserted, dna, is, present, in, the, embryonic, stem, cells, bacteria, consist, of, a, single, cell, and, reproduce, clonally, so, regeneration, is, not, necessary, selectable, markers, are, used, to, easily, differentiate, transformed, from, untransformed, cells, these, markers, are, usually, present, in, the, transgenic, organism, although, a, number, of, strategies, have, been, developed, that, can, remove, the, selectable, marker, from, the, mature, transgenic, plant, further, testing, using, pcr, southern, hybridization, and, dna, sequencing, is, conducted, to, confirm, that, an, organism, contains, the, new, gene, these, tests, can, also, confirm, the, chromosomal, location, and, copy, number, of, the, inserted, gene, the, presence, of, the, gene, does, not, guarantee, it, will, be, expressed, at, appropriate, levels, in, the, target, tissue, so, methods, that, look, for, and, measure, the, gene, products, rna, and, protein, are, also, used, these, include, northern, hybridisation, quantitative, rt, pcr, western, blot, immunofluorescence, elisa, and, phenotypic, analysis, the, new, genetic, material, can, be, inserted, randomly, within, the, host, genome, or, targeted, to, a, specific, location, the, technique, of, gene, targeting, uses, homologous, recombination, to, make, desired, changes, to, a, specific, endogenous, gene, this, tends, to, occur, at, a, relatively, low, frequency, in, plants, and, animals, and, generally, requires, the, use, of, selectable, markers, the, frequency, of, gene, targeting, can, be, greatly, enhanced, through, genome, editing, genome, editing, uses, artificially, engineered, nucleases, that, create, specific, double, stranded, breaks, at, desired, locations, in, the, genome, and, use, the, cell, s, endogenous, mechanisms, to, repair, the, induced, break, by, the, natural, processes, of, homologous, recombination, and, nonhomologous, end, joining, there, are, four, families, of, engineered, nucleases, meganucleases, zinc, finger, nucleases, transcription, activator, like, effector, nucleases, talens, and, the, cas9, guiderna, system, adapted, from, crispr, talen, and, crispr, are, the, two, most, commonly, used, and, each, has, its, own, advantages, talens, have, greater, target, specificity, while, crispr, is, easier, to, design, and, more, efficient, in, addition, to, enhancing, gene, targeting, engineered, nucleases, can, be, used, to, introduce, mutations, at, endogenous, genes, that, generate, a, gene, knockout, genetic, engineering, has, applications, in, medicine, research, industry, and, agriculture, and, can, be, used, on, a, wide, range, of, plants, animals, and, microorganisms, bacteria, the, first, organisms, to, be, genetically, modified, can, have, plasmid, dna, inserted, containing, new, genes, that, code, for, medicines, or, enzymes, that, process, food, and, other, substrates, plants, have, been, modified, for, insect, protection, herbicide, resistance, virus, resistance, enhanced, nutrition, tolerance, to, environmental, pressures, and, the, production, of, edible, vaccines, most, commercialised, gmos, are, insect, resistant, or, herbicide, tolerant, crop, plants, genetically, modified, animals, have, been, used, for, research, model, animals, and, the, production, of, agricultural, or, pharmaceutical, products, the, genetically, modified, animals, include, animals, with, genes, knocked, out, increased, susceptibility, to, disease, hormones, for, extra, growth, and, the, ability, to, express, proteins, in, their, milk, genetic, engineering, has, many, applications, to, medicine, that, include, the, manufacturing, of, drugs, creation, of, model, animals, that, mimic, human, conditions, and, gene, therapy, one, of, the, earliest, uses, of, genetic, engineering, was, to, mass, produce, human, insulin, in, bacteria, this, application, has, now, been, applied, to, human, growth, hormones, follicle, stimulating, hormones, for, treating, infertility, human, albumin, monoclonal, antibodies, antihemophilic, factors, vaccines, and, many, other, drugs, mouse, hybridomas, cells, fused, together, to, create, monoclonal, antibodies, have, been, adapted, through, genetic, engineering, to, create, human, monoclonal, antibodies, genetically, engineered, viruses, are, being, developed, that, can, still, confer, immunity, but, lack, the, infectious, sequences, genetic, engineering, is, also, used, to, create, animal, models, of, human, diseases, genetically, modified, mice, are, the, most, common, genetically, engineered, animal, model, they, have, been, used, to, study, and, model, cancer, the, oncomouse, obesity, heart, disease, diabetes, arthritis, substance, abuse, anxiety, aging, and, parkinson, disease, potential, cures, can, be, tested, against, these, mouse, models, gene, therapy, is, the, genetic, engineering, of, humans, generally, by, replacing, defective, genes, with, effective, ones, clinical, research, using, somatic, gene, therapy, has, been, conducted, with, several, diseases, including, x, linked, scid, chronic, lymphocytic, leukemia, cll, and, parkinson, s, disease, in, 2012, alipogene, tiparvovec, became, the, first, gene, therapy, treatment, to, be, approved, for, clinical, use, in, 2015, a, virus, was, used, to, insert, a, healthy, gene, into, the, skin, cells, of, a, boy, suffering, from, a, rare, skin, disease, epidermolysis, bullosa, in, order, to, grow, and, then, graft, healthy, skin, onto, 80, percent, of, the, boy, s, body, which, was, affected, by, the, illness, germline, gene, therapy, would, result, in, any, change, being, inheritable, which, has, raised, concerns, within, the, scientific, community, in, 2015, crispr, was, used, to, edit, the, dna, of, non, viable, human, embryos, leading, scientists, of, major, world, academies, to, call, for, a, moratorium, on, inheritable, human, genome, edits, there, are, also, concerns, that, the, technology, could, be, used, not, just, for, treatment, but, for, enhancement, modification, or, alteration, of, a, human, beings, appearance, adaptability, intelligence, character, or, behavior, the, distinction, between, cure, and, enhancement, can, also, be, difficult, to, establish, in, november, 2018, he, jiankui, announced, that, he, had, edited, the, genomes, of, two, human, embryos, to, attempt, to, disable, the, ccr5, gene, which, codes, for, a, receptor, that, hiv, uses, to, enter, cells, the, work, was, widely, condemned, as, unethical, dangerous, and, premature, currently, germline, modification, is, banned, in, 40, countries, scientists, that, do, this, type, of, research, will, often, let, embryos, grow, for, a, few, days, without, allowing, it, to, develop, into, a, baby, researchers, are, altering, the, genome, of, pigs, to, induce, the, growth, of, human, organs, with, the, aim, of, increasing, the, success, of, pig, to, human, organ, transplantation, scientists, are, creating, gene, drives, changing, the, genomes, of, mosquitoes, to, make, them, immune, to, malaria, and, then, looking, to, spread, the, genetically, altered, mosquitoes, throughout, the, mosquito, population, in, the, hopes, of, eliminating, the, disease, genetic, engineering, is, an, important, tool, for, natural, scientists, with, the, creation, of, transgenic, organisms, one, of, the, most, important, tools, for, analysis, of, gene, function, genes, and, other, genetic, information, from, a, wide, range, of, organisms, can, be, inserted, into, bacteria, for, storage, and, modification, creating, genetically, modified, bacteria, in, the, process, bacteria, are, cheap, easy, to, grow, clonal, multiply, quickly, relatively, easy, to, transform, and, can, be, stored, at, 80, c, almost, indefinitely, once, a, gene, is, isolated, it, can, be, stored, inside, the, bacteria, providing, an, unlimited, supply, for, research, organisms, are, genetically, engineered, to, discover, the, functions, of, certain, genes, this, could, be, the, effect, on, the, phenotype, of, the, organism, where, the, gene, is, expressed, or, what, other, genes, it, interacts, with, these, experiments, generally, involve, loss, of, function, gain, of, function, tracking, and, expression, organisms, can, have, their, cells, transformed, with, a, gene, coding, for, a, useful, protein, such, as, an, enzyme, so, that, they, will, overexpress, the, desired, protein, mass, quantities, of, the, protein, can, then, be, manufactured, by, growing, the, transformed, organism, in, bioreactor, equipment, using, industrial, fermentation, and, then, purifying, the, protein, some, genes, do, not, work, well, in, bacteria, so, yeast, insect, cells, or, mammalian, cells, can, also, be, used, these, techniques, are, used, to, produce, medicines, such, as, insulin, human, growth, hormone, and, vaccines, supplements, such, as, tryptophan, aid, in, the, production, of, food, chymosin, in, cheese, making, and, fuels, other, applications, with, genetically, engineered, bacteria, could, involve, making, them, perform, tasks, outside, their, natural, cycle, such, as, making, biofuels, cleaning, up, oil, spills, carbon, and, other, toxic, waste, and, detecting, arsenic, in, drinking, water, certain, genetically, modified, microbes, can, also, be, used, in, biomining, and, bioremediation, due, to, their, ability, to, extract, heavy, metals, from, their, environment, and, incorporate, them, into, compounds, that, are, more, easily, recoverable, in, materials, science, a, genetically, modified, virus, has, been, used, in, a, research, laboratory, as, a, scaffold, for, assembling, a, more, environmentally, friendly, lithium, ion, battery, bacteria, have, also, been, engineered, to, function, as, sensors, by, expressing, a, fluorescent, protein, under, certain, environmental, conditions, one, of, the, best, known, and, controversial, applications, of, genetic, engineering, is, the, creation, and, use, of, genetically, modified, crops, or, genetically, modified, livestock, to, produce, genetically, modified, food, crops, have, been, developed, to, increase, production, increase, tolerance, to, abiotic, stresses, alter, the, composition, of, the, food, or, to, produce, novel, products, the, first, crops, to, be, released, commercially, on, a, large, scale, provided, protection, from, insect, pests, or, tolerance, to, herbicides, fungal, and, virus, resistant, crops, have, also, been, developed, or, are, in, development, this, makes, the, insect, and, weed, management, of, crops, easier, and, can, indirectly, increase, crop, yield, gm, crops, that, directly, improve, yield, by, accelerating, growth, or, making, the, plant, more, hardy, by, improving, salt, cold, or, drought, tolerance, are, also, under, development, in, 2016, salmon, have, been, genetically, modified, with, growth, hormones, to, reach, normal, adult, size, much, faster, gmos, have, been, developed, that, modify, the, quality, of, produce, by, increasing, the, nutritional, value, or, providing, more, industrially, useful, qualities, or, quantities, the, amflora, potato, produces, a, more, industrially, useful, blend, of, starches, soybeans, and, canola, have, been, genetically, modified, to, produce, more, healthy, oils, the, first, commercialised, gm, food, was, a, tomato, that, had, delayed, ripening, increasing, its, shelf, life, plants, and, animals, have, been, engineered, to, produce, materials, they, do, not, normally, make, pharming, uses, crops, and, animals, as, bioreactors, to, produce, vaccines, drug, intermediates, or, the, drugs, themselves, the, useful, product, is, purified, from, the, harvest, and, then, used, in, the, standard, pharmaceutical, production, process, cows, and, goats, have, been, engineered, to, express, drugs, and, other, proteins, in, their, milk, and, in, 2009, the, fda, approved, a, drug, produced, in, goat, milk, genetic, engineering, has, potential, applications, in, conservation, and, natural, area, management, gene, transfer, through, viral, vectors, has, been, proposed, as, a, means, of, controlling, invasive, species, as, well, as, vaccinating, threatened, fauna, from, disease, transgenic, trees, have, been, suggested, as, a, way, to, confer, resistance, to, pathogens, in, wild, populations, with, the, increasing, risks, of, maladaptation, in, organisms, as, a, result, of, climate, change, and, other, perturbations, facilitated, adaptation, through, gene, tweaking, could, be, one, solution, to, reducing, extinction, risks, applications, of, genetic, engineering, in, conservation, are, thus, far, mostly, theoretical, and, have, yet, to, be, put, into, practice, genetic, engineering, is, also, being, used, to, create, microbial, art, some, bacteria, have, been, genetically, engineered, to, create, black, and, white, photographs, novelty, items, such, as, lavender, colored, carnations, blue, roses, and, glowing, fish, have, also, been, produced, through, genetic, engineering, the, regulation, of, genetic, engineering, concerns, the, approaches, taken, by, governments, to, assess, and, manage, the, risks, associated, with, the, development, and, release, of, gmos, the, development, of, a, regulatory, framework, began, in, 1975, at, asilomar, california, the, asilomar, meeting, recommended, a, set, of, voluntary, guidelines, regarding, the, use, of, recombinant, technology, as, the, technology, improved, the, us, established, a, committee, at, the, office, of, science, and, technology, which, assigned, regulatory, approval, of, gm, food, to, the, usda, fda, and, epa, the, cartagena, protocol, on, biosafety, an, international, treaty, that, governs, the, transfer, handling, and, use, of, gmos, was, adopted, on, 29, january, 2000, one, hundred, and, fifty, seven, countries, are, members, of, the, protocol, and, many, use, it, as, a, reference, point, for, their, own, regulations, the, legal, and, regulatory, status, of, gm, foods, varies, by, country, with, some, nations, banning, or, restricting, them, and, others, permitting, them, with, widely, differing, degrees, of, regulation, some, countries, allow, the, import, of, gm, food, with, authorisation, but, either, do, not, allow, its, cultivation, russia, norway, israel, or, have, provisions, for, cultivation, even, though, no, gm, products, are, yet, produced, japan, south, korea, most, countries, that, do, not, allow, gmo, cultivation, do, permit, research, some, of, the, most, marked, differences, occur, between, the, us, and, europe, the, us, policy, focuses, on, the, product, not, the, process, only, looks, at, verifiable, scientific, risks, and, uses, the, concept, of, substantial, equivalence, the, european, union, by, contrast, has, possibly, the, most, stringent, gmo, regulations, in, the, world, all, gmos, along, with, irradiated, food, are, considered, new, food, and, subject, to, extensive, case, by, case, science, based, food, evaluation, by, the, european, food, safety, authority, the, criteria, for, authorisation, fall, in, four, broad, categories, safety, freedom, of, choice, labelling, and, traceability, the, level, of, regulation, in, other, countries, that, cultivate, gmos, lie, in, between, europe, and, the, united, states, one, of, the, key, issues, concerning, regulators, is, whether, gm, products, should, be, labeled, the, european, commission, says, that, mandatory, labeling, and, traceability, are, needed, to, allow, for, informed, choice, avoid, potential, false, advertising, and, facilitate, the, withdrawal, of, products, if, adverse, effects, on, health, or, the, environment, are, discovered, the, american, medical, association, and, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, say, that, absent, scientific, evidence, of, harm, even, voluntary, labeling, is, misleading, and, will, falsely, alarm, consumers, labeling, of, gmo, products, in, the, marketplace, is, required, in, 64, countries, labeling, can, be, mandatory, up, to, a, threshold, gm, content, level, which, varies, between, countries, or, voluntary, in, canada, and, the, us, labeling, of, gm, food, is, voluntary, while, in, europe, all, food, including, processed, food, or, feed, which, contains, greater, than, 0, 9, of, approved, gmos, must, be, labelled, critics, have, objected, to, the, use, of, genetic, engineering, on, several, grounds, including, ethical, ecological, and, economic, concerns, many, of, these, concerns, involve, gm, crops, and, whether, food, produced, from, them, is, safe, and, what, impact, growing, them, will, have, on, the, environment, these, controversies, have, led, to, litigation, international, trade, disputes, and, protests, and, to, restrictive, regulation, of, commercial, products, in, some, countries, accusations, that, scientists, are, playing, god, and, other, religious, issues, have, been, ascribed, to, the, technology, from, the, beginning, other, ethical, issues, raised, include, the, patenting, of, life, the, use, of, intellectual, property, rights, the, level, of, labeling, on, products, control, of, the, food, supply, and, the, objectivity, of, the, regulatory, process, although, doubts, have, been, raised, economically, most, studies, have, found, growing, gm, crops, to, be, beneficial, to, farmers, gene, flow, between, gm, crops, and, compatible, plants, along, with, increased, use, of, selective, herbicides, can, increase, the, risk, of, superweeds, developing, other, environmental, concerns, involve, potential, impacts, on, non, target, organisms, including, soil, microbes, and, an, increase, in, secondary, and, resistant, insect, pests, many, of, the, environmental, impacts, regarding, gm, crops, may, take, many, years, to, be, understood, and, are, also, evident, in, conventional, agriculture, practices, with, the, commercialisation, of, genetically, modified, fish, there, are, concerns, over, what, the, environmental, consequences, will, be, if, they, escape, there, are, three, main, concerns, over, the, safety, of, genetically, modified, food, whether, they, may, provoke, an, allergic, reaction, whether, the, genes, could, transfer, from, the, food, into, human, cells, and, whether, the, genes, not, approved, for, human, consumption, could, outcross, to, other, crops, there, is, a, scientific, consensus, that, currently, available, food, derived, from, gm, crops, poses, no, greater, risk, to, human, health, than, conventional, food, but, that, each, gm, food, needs, to, be, tested, on, a, case, by, case, basis, before, introduction, nonetheless, members, of, the, public, are, less, likely, than, scientists, to, perceive, gm, foods, as, safe, genetic, engineering, features, in, many, science, fiction, stories, frank, herbert, s, novel, the, white, plague, describes, the, deliberate, use, of, genetic, engineering, to, create, a, pathogen, which, specifically, kills, women, another, of, herbert, s, creations, the, dune, series, of, novels, uses, genetic, engineering, to, create, the, powerful, tleilaxu, few, films, have, informed, audiences, about, genetic, engineering, with, the, exception, of, the, 1978, the, boys, from, brazil, and, the, 1993, jurassic, park, both, of, which, make, use, of, a, lesson, a, demonstration, and, a, clip, of, scientific, film, genetic, engineering, methods, are, weakly, represented, in, film, michael, clark, writing, for, the, wellcome, trust, calls, the, portrayal, of, genetic, engineering, and, biotechnology, seriously, distorted, in, films, such, as, the, 6th, day, in, clark, s, view, the, biotechnology, is, typically, given, fantastic, but, visually, arresting, forms, while, the, science, is, either, relegated, to, the, background, or, fictionalised, to, suit, a, young, audience
