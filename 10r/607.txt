a, launch, pad, is, an, above, ground, facility, from, which, a, rocket, powered, missile, or, space, vehicle, is, vertically, launched, the, term, launch, pad, can, be, used, to, describe, just, the, central, launch, platform, mobile, launcher, platform, or, the, entire, complex, launch, complex, the, entire, complex, will, include, a, launch, mount, or, launch, platform, to, physically, support, the, vehicle, a, service, structure, with, umbilicals, and, the, infrastructure, required, to, provide, propellants, cryogenic, fluids, electrical, power, communications, telemetry, rocket, assembly, payload, processing, storage, facilities, for, propellants, and, gases, equipment, access, roads, and, drainage, most, launch, pads, include, fixed, service, structures, to, provide, one, or, more, access, platforms, to, assemble, inspect, and, maintain, the, vehicle, and, to, allow, access, to, the, spacecraft, including, the, loading, of, crew, the, pad, may, contain, a, flame, deflection, structure, to, prevent, the, intense, heat, of, the, rocket, exhaust, from, damaging, the, vehicle, or, pad, structures, and, a, sound, suppression, system, spraying, large, quantities, of, water, may, be, employed, the, pad, may, also, be, protected, by, lightning, arresters, a, spaceport, typically, includes, multiple, launch, complexes, and, other, supporting, infrastructure, a, launch, pad, is, distinct, from, a, missile, launch, facility, or, missile, silo, or, missile, complex, which, also, launches, a, missile, vertically, but, is, located, underground, in, order, to, help, harden, it, against, enemy, attack, the, launch, complex, for, liquid, fueled, rockets, often, has, extensive, ground, support, equipment, including, propellant, tanks, and, plumbing, to, fill, the, rocket, before, launch, cryogenic, propellants, liquid, oxygen, oxidizer, and, liquid, hydrogen, or, liquid, methane, fuel, need, to, be, continuously, topped, off, i, e, boil, off, replaced, during, the, launch, sequence, countdown, as, the, vehicle, awaits, liftoff, this, becomes, particularly, important, as, complex, sequences, may, be, interrupted, by, planned, or, unplanned, holds, to, fix, problems, most, rockets, need, to, be, supported, and, held, down, for, a, few, seconds, after, ignition, while, the, engines, build, up, to, full, thrust, the, vehicle, is, commonly, held, on, the, pad, by, hold, down, arms, or, explosive, bolts, which, are, triggered, when, the, vehicle, is, stable, and, ready, to, fly, at, which, point, all, umbilical, connections, with, the, pad, are, released, precursors, to, modern, rocketry, such, as, fireworks, and, rocket, launchers, did, not, generally, require, dedicated, launch, pads, this, was, due, in, part, to, their, relatively, portable, size, as, well, as, the, sufficiency, of, their, casings, in, sustaining, stresses, one, of, the, first, pads, for, a, liquid, fueled, rocket, what, would, later, be, named, the, goddard, rocket, launching, site, after, robert, h, goddard, s, series, of, launch, tests, starting, in, 1926, consisted, of, a, mount, situated, on, an, open, field, in, rural, massachusetts, the, mount, was, compromised, of, a, frame, with, a, series, of, gasoline, and, liquid, oxygen, lines, feeding, into, the, rocket, it, wasn, t, until, the, 1930s, that, rockets, were, increasing, enough, in, size, and, strength, that, specialized, launch, facilities, became, necessary, the, verein, f, r, raumschiffahrt, in, germany, was, permitted, after, a, request, for, funding, in, 1930, to, move, from, farms, to, the, berlin, rocket, launching, site, german, raketenflugplatz, berlin, a, repurposed, ammunition, dump, a, test, stand, was, built, for, liquid, propellant, rockets, in, kummersdorf, in, 1932, where, the, early, designs, from, the, aggregat, series, of, ballistic, missiles, were, afterwards, developed, this, site, was, also, the, location, of, the, first, casualties, in, rocket, development, when, dr, wahmke, and, 2, assistants, were, killed, and, another, assistant, was, injured, a, propellant, fuel, tank, exploded, while, experimenting, with, mixing, 90, hydrogen, peroxide, and, alcohol, before, combustion, 35, 52, 53, in, may, 1937, dornberger, and, most, of, his, staff, moved, to, the, peenem, nde, army, research, center, on, the, island, of, usedom, on, the, baltic, coast, which, offered, much, greater, space, and, secrecy, dr, thiel, and, his, staff, followed, in, the, summer, of, 1940, test, stand, vi, at, pennem, nde, was, an, exact, replica, to, kummersdorf, s, large, test, stand, 56, 60, 57, it, was, this, site, which, saw, the, development, of, the, v, 2, rocket, test, stand, vii, was, the, principle, testing, facility, at, the, peenem, nde, airfield, and, was, capable, of, static, firing, rocket, motors, with, up, to, 200, tons, of, thrust, launch, pads, would, increase, in, complexity, over, the, following, decades, throughout, and, following, the, space, race, where, large, volumes, of, exhaust, gases, are, expelled, during, engine, testing, or, vehicle, launch, a, flame, deflector, might, be, implemented, to, mitigate, damage, to, the, surrounding, pad, and, direct, exhaust, this, is, especially, important, with, reusable, launch, vehicles, to, increase, efficiency, of, launches, while, minimizing, time, spent, refurbishing, the, construction, of, a, launch, pad, begins, with, site, selection, considering, various, geographical, and, logistical, factors, it, is, often, advantageous, to, position, the, launch, pad, on, the, coast, particularly, with, the, ocean, to, the, east, to, leverage, the, earth, s, rotation, and, increase, the, specific, impulse, of, launches, space, programs, such, as, soviet, space, program, or, the, french, space, program, without, this, luxury, may, utilize, facilities, outside, of, their, main, territory, such, as, the, baikonur, cosmodrome, or, guiana, space, centre, to, launch, for, them, this, orientation, also, allows, for, safe, trajectory, paths, minimizing, risks, to, populated, areas, during, ascent, each, launch, site, is, unique, but, a, few, broad, types, can, be, described, by, the, means, by, which, the, space, vehicle, gets, to, the, pad, a, service, structure, is, a, steel, framework, or, tower, that, is, built, on, a, launch, pad, to, facilitate, assembly, and, servicing, an, umbilical, tower, also, usually, includes, an, elevator, which, allows, maintenance, and, crew, access, immediately, before, ignition, of, the, rocket, s, motors, all, connections, between, the, tower, and, the, craft, are, severed, and, the, bridges, over, which, these, connections, pass, often, quickly, swing, away, to, prevent, damage, to, the, structure, or, vehicle, a, flame, deflector, flame, diverter, or, flame, trench, is, a, structure, or, device, designed, to, redirect, or, disperse, the, flame, heat, and, exhaust, gases, produced, by, rocket, engines, or, other, propulsion, systems, the, amount, of, thrust, generated, by, a, rocket, launch, along, with, the, sound, it, produces, during, liftoff, can, damage, the, launchpad, and, service, structure, as, well, as, the, launch, vehicle, the, primary, goal, of, the, diverter, is, to, prevent, the, flame, from, causing, damage, to, equipment, infrastructure, or, the, surrounding, environment, flame, diverters, can, be, found, at, rocket, launch, sites, and, test, stands, where, large, volumes, of, exhaust, gases, are, expelled, during, engine, testing, or, vehicle, launch, sites, for, launching, large, rockets, are, often, equipped, with, a, sound, suppression, system, to, absorb, or, deflect, acoustic, energy, generated, during, a, rocket, launch, as, engine, exhaust, gasses, exceed, the, speed, of, sound, they, collide, with, the, ambient, air, and, shockwaves, are, created, with, noise, levels, approaching, 200, db, this, energy, can, be, reflected, by, the, launch, platform, and, pad, surfaces, and, could, potentially, cause, damage, to, the, launch, vehicle, payload, and, crew, for, instance, the, maximum, admissible, overall, sound, power, level, oaspl, for, payload, integrity, is, approximately, 145, db, sound, is, dissipated, by, huge, volumes, of, water, distributed, across, the, launch, pad, and, launch, platform, during, liftoff, water, based, acoustic, suppression, systems, are, common, on, launch, pads, they, aid, in, reducing, acoustic, energy, by, injecting, large, quantities, of, water, below, the, launch, pad, into, the, exhaust, plume, and, in, the, area, above, the, pad, flame, deflectors, or, flame, trenches, are, designed, to, channel, rocket, exhaust, away, from, the, launch, pad, but, also, redirect, acoustic, energy, away, in, rockets, using, liquid, hydrogen, as, their, source, of, propellant, hydrogen, burn, off, systems, hboi, also, known, as, radially, outward, firing, igniters, rofi, can, be, utilized, to, prevent, the, build, up, of, free, gaseous, hydrogen, gh2, in, the, aft, engine, area, of, the, vehicle, prior, to, engine, start, too, much, excess, hydrogen, in, the, aft, during, engine, start, can, result, in, an, overpressure, blast, wave, that, could, damage, the, launch, vehicle, and, surrounding, pad, structures, the, spacex, launch, sequence, includes, a, hold, down, feature, of, the, launch, pad, that, allows, full, engine, ignition, and, systems, check, before, liftoff, after, the, first, stage, engine, starts, the, launcher, is, held, down, and, not, released, for, flight, until, all, propulsion, and, vehicle, systems, are, confirmed, to, be, operating, normally, similar, hold, down, systems, have, been, used, on, launch, vehicles, such, as, saturn, v, and, space, shuttle, an, automatic, safe, shut, down, and, unloading, of, propellant, occur, if, any, abnormal, conditions, are, detected, prior, to, the, launch, date, spacex, sometimes, completes, a, test, cycle, culminating, in, a, three, and, a, half, second, first, stage, engine, static, firing, as, well
