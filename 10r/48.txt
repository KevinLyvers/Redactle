data, communication, including, data, transmission, and, data, reception, is, the, transfer, of, data, transmitted, and, received, over, a, point, to, point, or, point, to, multipoint, communication, channel, examples, of, such, channels, are, copper, wires, optical, fibers, wireless, communication, using, radio, spectrum, storage, media, and, computer, buses, the, data, are, represented, as, an, electromagnetic, signal, such, as, an, electrical, voltage, radiowave, microwave, or, infrared, signal, analog, transmission, is, a, method, of, conveying, voice, data, image, signal, or, video, information, using, a, continuous, signal, which, varies, in, amplitude, phase, or, some, other, property, in, proportion, to, that, of, a, variable, the, messages, are, either, represented, by, a, sequence, of, pulses, by, means, of, a, line, code, baseband, transmission, or, by, a, limited, set, of, continuously, varying, waveforms, passband, transmission, using, a, digital, modulation, method, the, passband, modulation, and, corresponding, demodulation, is, carried, out, by, modem, equipment, digital, communications, including, digital, transmission, and, digital, reception, is, the, transfer, of, either, a, digitized, analog, signal, or, a, born, digital, bitstream, according, to, the, most, common, definition, both, baseband, and, passband, bit, stream, components, are, considered, part, of, a, digital, signal, an, alternative, definition, considers, only, the, baseband, signal, as, digital, and, passband, transmission, of, digital, data, as, a, form, of, digital, to, analog, conversion, courses, and, textbooks, in, the, field, of, data, transmission, as, well, as, digital, transmission, and, digital, communications, have, similar, content, digital, transmission, or, data, transmission, traditionally, belongs, to, telecommunications, and, electrical, engineering, basic, principles, of, data, transmission, may, also, be, covered, within, the, computer, science, or, computer, engineering, topic, of, data, communications, which, also, includes, computer, networking, applications, and, communication, protocols, for, example, routing, switching, and, inter, process, communication, although, the, transmission, control, protocol, tcp, involves, transmission, tcp, and, other, transport, layer, protocols, are, covered, in, computer, networking, but, not, discussed, in, a, textbook, or, course, about, data, transmission, in, most, textbooks, the, term, analog, transmission, only, refers, to, the, transmission, of, an, analog, message, signal, without, digitization, by, means, of, an, analog, signal, either, as, a, non, modulated, baseband, signal, or, as, a, passband, signal, using, an, analog, modulation, method, such, as, am, or, fm, it, may, also, include, analog, over, analog, pulse, modulated, baseband, signals, such, as, pulse, width, modulation, in, a, few, books, within, the, computer, networking, tradition, analog, transmission, also, refers, to, passband, transmission, of, bit, streams, using, digital, modulation, methods, such, as, fsk, psk, and, ask, note, that, these, methods, are, covered, in, textbooks, named, digital, transmission, or, data, transmission, for, example, the, theoretical, aspects, of, data, transmission, are, covered, by, information, theory, and, coding, theory, courses, and, textbooks, in, the, field, of, data, transmission, typically, deal, with, the, following, osi, model, protocol, layers, and, topics, it, is, also, common, to, deal, with, the, cross, layer, design, of, those, three, layers, data, mainly, but, not, exclusively, informational, has, been, sent, via, non, electronic, e, g, optical, acoustic, mechanical, means, since, the, advent, of, communication, analog, signal, data, has, been, sent, electronically, since, the, advent, of, the, telephone, however, the, first, data, electromagnetic, transmission, applications, in, modern, time, were, electrical, telegraphy, 1809, and, teletypewriters, 1906, which, are, both, digital, signals, the, fundamental, theoretical, work, in, data, transmission, and, information, theory, by, harry, nyquist, ralph, hartley, claude, shannon, and, others, during, the, early, 20th, century, was, done, with, these, applications, in, mind, in, the, early, 1960s, paul, baran, invented, distributed, adaptive, message, block, switching, for, digital, communication, of, voice, messages, using, switches, that, were, low, cost, electronics, donald, davies, invented, and, implemented, modern, data, communication, during, 1965, 7, including, packet, switching, high, speed, routers, communication, protocols, hierarchical, computer, networks, and, the, essence, of, the, end, to, end, principle, baran, s, work, did, not, include, routers, with, software, switches, and, communication, protocols, nor, the, idea, that, users, rather, than, the, network, itself, would, provide, the, reliability, both, were, seminal, contributions, that, influenced, the, development, of, computer, networks, data, transmission, is, utilized, in, computers, in, computer, buses, and, for, communication, with, peripheral, equipment, via, parallel, ports, and, serial, ports, such, as, rs, 232, 1969, firewire, 1995, and, usb, 1996, the, principles, of, data, transmission, are, also, utilized, in, storage, media, for, error, detection, and, correction, since, 1951, the, first, practical, method, to, overcome, the, problem, of, receiving, data, accurately, by, the, receiver, using, digital, code, was, the, barker, code, invented, by, ronald, hugh, barker, in, 1952, and, published, in, 1953, data, transmission, is, utilized, in, computer, networking, equipment, such, as, modems, 1940, local, area, network, lan, adapters, 1964, repeaters, repeater, hubs, microwave, links, wireless, network, access, points, 1997, etc, in, telephone, networks, digital, communication, is, utilized, for, transferring, many, phone, calls, over, the, same, copper, cable, or, fiber, cable, by, means, of, pulse, code, modulation, pcm, in, combination, with, time, division, multiplexing, tdm, 1962, telephone, exchanges, have, become, digital, and, software, controlled, facilitating, many, value, added, services, for, example, the, first, axe, telephone, exchange, was, presented, in, 1976, digital, communication, to, the, end, user, using, integrated, services, digital, network, isdn, services, became, available, in, the, late, 1980s, since, the, end, of, the, 1990s, broadband, access, techniques, such, as, adsl, cable, modems, fiber, to, the, building, fttb, and, fiber, to, the, home, ftth, have, become, widespread, to, small, offices, and, homes, the, current, tendency, is, to, replace, traditional, telecommunication, services, with, packet, mode, communication, such, as, ip, telephony, and, iptv, transmitting, analog, signals, digitally, allows, for, greater, signal, processing, capability, the, ability, to, process, a, communications, signal, means, that, errors, caused, by, random, processes, can, be, detected, and, corrected, digital, signals, can, also, be, sampled, instead, of, continuously, monitored, the, multiplexing, of, multiple, digital, signals, is, much, simpler, compared, to, the, multiplexing, of, analog, signals, because, of, all, these, advantages, because, of, the, vast, demand, to, transmit, computer, data, and, the, ability, of, digital, communications, to, do, so, and, because, recent, advances, in, wideband, communication, channels, and, solid, state, electronics, have, allowed, engineers, to, realize, these, advantages, fully, digital, communications, have, grown, quickly, the, digital, revolution, has, also, resulted, in, many, digital, telecommunication, applications, where, the, principles, of, data, transmission, are, applied, examples, include, second, generation, 1991, and, later, cellular, telephony, video, conferencing, digital, tv, 1998, digital, radio, 1999, and, telemetry, data, transmission, digital, transmission, or, digital, communications, is, the, transfer, of, data, over, a, point, to, point, or, point, to, multipoint, communication, channel, examples, of, such, channels, include, copper, wires, optical, fibers, wireless, communication, channels, storage, media, and, computer, buses, the, data, are, represented, as, an, electromagnetic, signal, such, as, an, electrical, voltage, radiowave, microwave, or, infrared, light, while, analog, transmission, is, the, transfer, of, a, continuously, varying, analog, signal, over, an, analog, channel, digital, communication, is, the, transfer, of, discrete, messages, over, a, digital, or, an, analog, channel, the, messages, are, either, represented, by, a, sequence, of, pulses, by, means, of, a, line, code, baseband, transmission, or, by, a, limited, set, of, continuously, varying, wave, forms, passband, transmission, using, a, digital, modulation, method, the, passband, modulation, and, corresponding, demodulation, also, known, as, detection, is, carried, out, by, modem, equipment, according, to, the, most, common, definition, of, a, digital, signal, both, baseband, and, passband, signals, representing, bit, streams, are, considered, as, digital, transmission, while, an, alternative, definition, only, considers, the, baseband, signal, as, digital, and, passband, transmission, of, digital, data, as, a, form, of, digital, to, analog, conversion, data, transmitted, may, be, digital, messages, originating, from, a, data, source, for, example, a, computer, or, a, keyboard, it, may, also, be, an, analog, signal, such, as, a, phone, call, or, a, video, signal, digitized, into, a, bit, stream, for, example, using, pulse, code, modulation, pcm, or, more, advanced, source, coding, analog, to, digital, conversion, and, data, compression, schemes, this, source, coding, and, decoding, is, carried, out, by, codec, equipment, in, telecommunications, serial, transmission, is, the, sequential, transmission, of, signal, elements, of, a, group, representing, a, character, or, other, entity, of, data, digital, serial, transmissions, are, bits, sent, over, a, single, wire, frequency, or, optical, path, sequentially, because, it, requires, less, signal, processing, and, less, chances, for, error, than, parallel, transmission, the, transfer, rate, of, each, individual, path, may, be, faster, this, can, be, used, over, longer, distances, and, a, check, digit, or, parity, bit, can, be, sent, along, with, the, data, easily, parallel, transmission, is, the, simultaneous, transmission, of, related, signal, elements, over, two, or, more, separate, paths, multiple, electrical, wires, are, used, which, can, transmit, multiple, bits, simultaneously, which, allows, for, higher, data, transfer, rates, than, can, be, achieved, with, serial, transmission, this, method, is, typically, used, internally, within, the, computer, for, example, the, internal, buses, and, sometimes, externally, for, such, things, as, printers, timing, skew, can, be, a, significant, issue, in, these, systems, because, the, wires, in, parallel, data, transmission, unavoidably, have, slightly, different, properties, so, some, bits, may, arrive, before, others, which, may, corrupt, the, message, this, issue, tends, to, worsen, with, distance, making, parallel, data, transmission, less, reliable, for, long, distances, some, communications, channel, types, include, asynchronous, serial, communication, uses, start, and, stop, bits, to, signify, the, beginning, and, end, of, transmission, this, method, of, transmission, is, used, when, data, are, sent, intermittently, as, opposed, to, in, a, solid, stream, synchronous, transmission, synchronizes, transmission, speeds, at, both, the, receiving, and, sending, end, of, the, transmission, using, clock, signals, the, clock, may, be, a, separate, signal, or, embedded, in, the, data, a, continual, stream, of, data, is, then, sent, between, the, two, nodes, due, to, there, being, no, start, and, stop, bits, the, data, transfer, rate, may, be, more, efficient
