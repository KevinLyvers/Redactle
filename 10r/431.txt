a, lathe, l, e, is, a, machine, tool, that, rotates, a, workpiece, about, an, axis, of, rotation, to, perform, various, operations, such, as, cutting, sanding, knurling, drilling, deformation, facing, threading, and, turning, with, tools, that, are, applied, to, the, workpiece, to, create, an, object, with, symmetry, about, that, axis, lathes, are, used, in, woodturning, metalworking, metal, spinning, thermal, spraying, reclamation, and, glass, working, lathes, can, be, used, to, shape, pottery, the, best, known, design, being, the, potter, s, wheel, most, suitably, equipped, metalworking, lathes, can, also, be, used, to, produce, most, solids, of, revolution, plane, surfaces, and, screw, threads, or, helices, ornamental, lathes, can, produce, three, dimensional, solids, of, incredible, complexity, the, workpiece, is, usually, held, in, place, by, either, one, or, two, centers, at, least, one, of, which, can, typically, be, moved, horizontally, to, accommodate, varying, workpiece, lengths, other, work, holding, methods, include, clamping, the, work, about, the, axis, of, rotation, using, a, chuck, or, collet, or, to, a, faceplate, using, clamps, or, dog, clutch, examples, of, objects, that, can, be, produced, on, a, lathe, include, screws, candlesticks, gun, barrels, cue, sticks, table, legs, bowls, baseball, bats, pens, musical, instruments, especially, woodwind, instruments, and, crankshafts, the, lathe, is, an, ancient, tool, the, earliest, evidence, of, a, lathe, dates, back, to, ancient, egypt, around, 1300, bc, there, is, also, tenuous, evidence, for, its, existence, at, a, mycenaean, greek, site, dating, back, as, far, as, the, 13th, or, 14th, century, bc, clear, evidence, of, turned, artifacts, have, been, found, from, the, 6th, century, bc, fragments, of, a, wooden, bowl, in, an, etruscan, tomb, in, northern, italy, as, well, as, two, flat, wooden, dishes, with, decorative, turned, rims, from, modern, turkey, during, the, warring, states, period, in, china, c, 400, bc, the, ancient, chinese, used, rotary, lathes, to, sharpen, tools, and, weapons, on, an, industrial, scale, the, first, known, painting, showing, a, lathe, dates, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, in, ancient, egypt, pliny, later, describes, the, use, of, a, lathe, for, turning, soft, stone, in, his, natural, history, book, xxx, chapter, 44, precision, metal, cutting, lathes, were, developed, during, the, lead, up, to, the, industrial, revolution, and, were, critical, to, the, manufacture, of, mechanical, inventions, of, that, period, some, of, the, earliest, examples, include, a, version, with, a, mechanical, cutting, tool, supporting, carriage, and, a, set, of, gears, by, russian, engineer, andrey, nartov, in, 1718, and, another, with, a, slide, rest, shown, in, a, 1717, edition, of, the, french, encyclop, die, the, slide, rest, was, a, particularly, important, development, because, it, constrains, the, motion, of, the, cutting, tool, to, generate, accurate, cylindrical, or, conical, surfaces, unlike, earlier, lathes, that, involved, freehand, manipulation, of, the, tool, by, the, 1770s, precision, lathes, became, practical, and, well, known, a, slide, rest, is, clearly, shown, in, a, 1772, edition, of, the, encyclop, die, and, during, that, same, year, a, horse, powered, cannon, boring, lathe, was, installed, in, the, royal, arsenal, in, woolwich, england, by, jan, verbruggen, cannon, bored, by, verbruggen, s, lathe, were, stronger, and, more, accurate, than, their, predecessors, and, saw, service, in, american, revolutionary, war, henry, maudslay, the, inventor, of, many, subsequent, improvements, to, the, lathe, worked, as, an, apprentice, in, verbruggen, s, workshop, in, woolwich, during, the, industrial, revolution, mechanized, power, generated, by, water, wheels, or, steam, engines, was, transmitted, to, the, lathe, via, line, shafting, allowing, faster, and, easier, work, metalworking, lathes, evolved, into, heavier, machines, with, thicker, more, rigid, parts, between, the, late, 19th, and, mid, 20th, centuries, individual, electric, motors, at, each, lathe, replaced, line, shafting, as, the, power, source, beginning, in, the, 1950s, servomechanisms, were, applied, to, the, control, of, lathes, and, other, machine, tools, via, numerical, control, which, often, was, coupled, with, computers, to, yield, computerized, numerical, control, cnc, today, manually, controlled, and, cnc, lathes, coexist, in, the, manufacturing, industries, a, lathe, may, or, may, not, have, legs, which, sit, on, the, floor, and, elevate, the, lathe, bed, to, a, working, height, a, lathe, may, be, small, and, sit, on, a, workbench, or, table, not, requiring, a, stand, almost, all, lathes, have, a, bed, which, is, almost, always, a, horizontal, beam, although, cnc, lathes, commonly, have, an, inclined, or, vertical, beam, for, a, bed, to, ensure, that, swarf, or, chips, falls, free, of, the, bed, woodturning, lathes, specialized, for, turning, large, bowls, often, have, no, bed, or, tail, stock, merely, a, free, standing, headstock, and, a, cantilevered, tool, rest, at, one, end, of, the, bed, almost, always, the, left, as, the, operator, faces, the, lathe, is, a, headstock, the, headstock, contains, high, precision, spinning, bearings, rotating, within, the, bearings, is, a, horizontal, axle, with, an, axis, parallel, to, the, bed, called, the, spindle, spindles, are, often, hollow, and, have, an, interior, morse, taper, on, the, spindle, nose, i, e, facing, to, the, right, towards, the, bed, by, which, work, holding, accessories, may, be, mounted, to, the, spindle, spindles, may, also, have, arrangements, for, work, holding, on, the, left, hand, end, of, the, spindle, with, other, tooling, arrangements, for, particular, tasks, i, e, facing, away, from, the, main, bed, end, or, may, have, a, hand, wheel, or, other, accessory, mechanism, on, their, outboard, end, spindles, are, powered, and, impart, motion, to, the, workpiece, the, spindle, is, driven, either, by, foot, power, from, a, treadle, and, flywheel, or, by, a, belt, or, gear, drive, from, a, power, source, such, as, electric, motor, or, overhead, line, shafts, in, most, modern, lathes, this, power, source, is, an, integral, electric, motor, often, either, in, the, headstock, to, the, left, of, the, headstock, or, beneath, the, headstock, concealed, in, the, stand, in, addition, to, the, spindle, and, its, bearings, the, headstock, often, contains, parts, to, convert, the, motor, speed, into, various, spindle, speeds, various, types, of, speed, changing, mechanism, achieve, this, from, a, cone, pulley, or, step, pulley, to, a, cone, pulley, with, back, gear, which, is, essentially, a, low, range, similar, in, net, effect, to, the, two, speed, rear, of, a, truck, to, an, entire, gear, train, similar, to, that, of, a, manual, shift, automotive, transmission, some, motors, have, electronic, rheostat, type, speed, controls, which, obviates, cone, pulleys, or, gears, the, counterpoint, to, the, headstock, is, the, tailstock, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, loose, head, as, it, can, be, positioned, at, any, convenient, point, on, the, bed, by, sliding, it, to, the, required, area, the, tail, stock, contains, a, barrel, which, does, not, rotate, but, can, slide, in, and, out, parallel, to, the, axis, of, the, bed, and, directly, in, line, with, the, headstock, spindle, the, barrel, is, hollow, and, usually, contains, a, taper, to, facilitate, the, gripping, of, various, types, of, tooling, its, most, common, uses, are, to, hold, a, hardened, steel, center, which, is, used, to, support, long, thin, shafts, while, turning, or, to, hold, drill, bits, for, drilling, axial, holes, in, the, work, piece, many, other, uses, are, possible, metalworking, lathes, have, a, carriage, comprising, a, saddle, and, apron, topped, with, a, cross, slide, which, is, a, flat, piece, that, sits, crosswise, on, the, bed, and, can, be, cranked, at, right, angles, to, the, bed, sitting, atop, the, cross, slide, is, usually, another, slide, called, a, compound, rest, which, provides, two, additional, axes, of, motion, rotary, and, linear, atop, that, sits, a, toolpost, which, holds, a, cutting, tool, which, removes, material, from, the, workpiece, there, may, or, may, not, be, a, leadscrew, which, moves, the, cross, slide, along, the, bed, woodturning, and, metal, spinning, lathes, do, not, have, cross, slides, but, rather, have, banjos, which, are, flat, pieces, that, sit, crosswise, on, the, bed, the, position, of, a, banjo, can, be, adjusted, by, hand, no, gearing, is, involved, ascending, vertically, from, the, banjo, is, a, tool, post, at, the, top, of, which, is, a, horizontal, tool, rest, in, woodturning, hand, tools, are, braced, against, the, tool, rest, and, levered, into, the, workpiece, in, metal, spinning, the, further, pin, ascends, vertically, from, the, tool, rest, and, serves, as, a, fulcrum, against, which, tools, may, be, levered, into, the, workpiece, unless, a, workpiece, has, a, taper, machined, onto, it, which, perfectly, matches, the, internal, taper, in, the, spindle, or, has, threads, which, perfectly, match, the, external, threads, on, the, spindle, two, conditions, which, rarely, exist, an, accessory, must, be, used, to, mount, a, workpiece, to, the, spindle, a, workpiece, may, be, bolted, or, screwed, to, a, faceplate, a, large, flat, disk, that, mounts, to, the, spindle, in, the, alternative, faceplate, dogs, may, be, used, to, secure, the, work, to, the, faceplate, a, workpiece, may, be, mounted, on, a, mandrel, or, circular, work, clamped, in, a, three, or, four, jaw, chuck, for, irregular, shaped, workpieces, it, is, usual, to, use, a, four, jaw, independent, moving, jaws, chuck, these, holding, devices, mount, directly, to, the, lathe, headstock, spindle, in, precision, work, and, in, some, classes, of, repetition, work, cylindrical, workpieces, are, usually, held, in, a, collet, inserted, into, the, spindle, and, secured, either, by, a, draw, bar, or, by, a, collet, closing, cap, on, the, spindle, suitable, collets, may, also, be, used, to, mount, square, or, hexagonal, workpieces, in, precision, toolmaking, work, such, collets, are, usually, of, the, draw, in, variety, where, as, the, collet, is, tightened, the, workpiece, moves, slightly, back, into, the, headstock, whereas, for, most, repetition, work, the, dead, length, variety, is, preferred, as, this, ensures, that, the, position, of, the, workpiece, does, not, move, as, the, collet, is, tightened, a, soft, workpiece, e, g, wood, may, be, pinched, between, centers, by, using, a, spur, drive, at, the, headstock, which, bites, into, the, wood, and, imparts, torque, to, it, a, soft, dead, center, is, used, in, the, headstock, spindle, as, the, work, rotates, with, the, centre, because, the, centre, is, soft, it, can, be, trued, in, place, before, use, the, included, angle, is, 60, traditionally, a, hard, dead, center, is, used, together, with, suitable, lubricant, in, the, tailstock, to, support, the, workpiece, in, modern, practice, the, dead, center, is, frequently, replaced, by, a, running, center, as, it, turns, freely, with, the, workpiece, usually, on, ball, bearings, reducing, the, frictional, heat, especially, important, at, high, speeds, when, clear, facing, a, long, length, of, material, it, must, be, supported, at, both, ends, this, can, be, achieved, by, the, use, of, a, traveling, or, fixed, steady, if, a, steady, is, not, available, the, end, face, being, worked, on, may, be, supported, by, a, dead, stationary, half, center, a, half, center, has, a, flat, surface, machined, across, a, broad, section, of, half, of, its, diameter, at, the, pointed, end, a, small, section, of, the, tip, of, the, dead, center, is, retained, to, ensure, concentricity, lubrication, must, be, applied, at, this, point, of, contact, and, tail, stock, pressure, reduced, a, lathe, carrier, or, lathe, dog, may, also, be, employed, when, turning, between, two, centers, in, woodturning, one, variation, of, a, running, center, is, a, cup, center, which, is, a, cone, of, metal, surrounded, by, an, annular, ring, of, metal, that, decreases, the, chances, of, the, workpiece, splitting, a, circular, metal, plate, with, even, spaced, holes, around, the, periphery, mounted, to, the, spindle, is, called, an, index, plate, it, can, be, used, to, rotate, the, spindle, to, a, precise, angle, then, lock, it, in, place, facilitating, repeated, auxiliary, operations, done, to, the, workpiece, other, accessories, including, items, such, as, taper, turning, attachments, knurling, tools, vertical, slides, fixed, and, traveling, steadies, etc, increase, the, versatility, of, a, lathe, and, the, range, of, work, it, may, perform, when, a, workpiece, is, fixed, between, the, headstock, and, the, tail, stock, it, is, said, to, be, between, centers, when, a, workpiece, is, supported, at, both, ends, it, is, more, stable, and, more, force, may, be, applied, to, the, workpiece, via, tools, at, a, right, angle, to, the, axis, of, rotation, without, fear, that, the, workpiece, may, break, loose, when, a, workpiece, is, fixed, only, to, the, spindle, at, the, headstock, end, the, work, is, said, to, be, face, work, when, a, workpiece, is, supported, in, this, manner, less, force, may, be, applied, to, the, workpiece, via, tools, at, a, right, angle, to, the, axis, of, rotation, lest, the, workpiece, rip, free, thus, most, work, must, be, done, axially, towards, the, headstock, or, at, right, angles, but, gently, when, a, workpiece, is, mounted, with, a, certain, axis, of, rotation, worked, then, remounted, with, a, new, axis, of, rotation, this, is, referred, to, as, eccentric, turning, or, multi, axis, turning, the, result, is, that, various, cross, sections, of, the, workpiece, are, rotationally, symmetric, but, the, workpiece, as, a, whole, is, not, rotationally, symmetric, this, technique, is, used, for, camshafts, various, types, of, chair, legs, lathes, are, usually, sized, by, the, capacity, of, the, work, that, they, may, hold, usually, large, work, is, held, at, both, ends, either, using, a, chuck, or, other, drive, in, the, headstock, and, a, centre, in, the, tailstock, to, maximise, size, turning, between, centres, allows, the, work, to, be, as, close, to, the, headstock, as, possible, and, is, used, to, determine, the, longest, piece, the, lathe, will, turn, when, the, base, of, the, tailstock, is, aligned, with, the, end, of, the, bed, the, distance, between, centres, gives, the, maximum, length, of, work, the, lathe, will, officially, hold, it, is, possible, to, get, slightly, longer, items, in, if, the, tailstock, overhangs, the, end, of, the, bed, but, this, is, an, ill, advised, practice, purchasing, an, extension, or, larger, bed, would, be, a, wise, alternative, the, other, dimension, of, the, workpiece, is, how, far, off, centre, it, can, be, this, is, known, as, the, swing, the, distance, from, the, head, center, of, a, lathe, to, the, bed, or, ways, or, to, the, rest, the, swing, determines, the, diametric, size, of, the, object, which, is, capable, of, being, turned, in, the, lathe, anything, larger, would, interfere, with, the, bed, this, limit, is, called, the, swing, of, the, bed, the, swing, of, the, rest, is, the, size, which, will, rotate, above, the, rest, which, lies, upon, the, bed, from, the, notion, that, the, work, swings, from, the, centre, upon, which, it, is, mounted, this, makes, more, sense, with, odd, shaped, work, but, as, the, lathe, is, most, often, used, with, cylindrical, work, it, is, useful, to, know, the, maximum, diameter, of, work, the, lathe, will, hold, this, is, simply, the, value, of, the, swing, or, centre, height, above, the, bed, multiplied, by, two, for, some, reason, in, the, u, s, swing, is, assumed, to, be, diameter, but, this, is, incorrect, to, be, clear, on, size, it, is, better, therefore, to, describe, the, dimension, as, centre, height, above, the, bed, as, parts, of, the, lathe, reduce, capacity, measurements, such, as, swing, over, cross, slide, or, other, named, parts, can, be, found, the, smallest, lathes, are, jewelers, lathes, or, watchmaker, lathes, which, though, often, small, enough, to, be, held, in, one, hand, are, normally, fastened, to, a, bench, there, are, rare, and, even, smaller, mini, lathes, made, for, precision, cutting, the, workpieces, machined, on, a, jeweler, s, lathe, are, often, metal, but, other, softer, materials, can, also, be, machined, jeweler, s, lathes, can, be, used, with, hand, held, graver, tools, or, with, a, compound, rest, that, attach, to, the, lathe, bed, and, allows, the, tool, to, be, clamped, in, place, and, moved, by, a, screw, or, lever, feed, graver, tools, are, generally, supported, by, a, t, rest, not, fixed, to, a, cross, slide, or, compound, rest, the, work, is, usually, held, in, a, collet, but, high, precision, 3, and, 6, jaw, chucks, are, also, commonly, employed, common, spindle, bore, sizes, are, 6, mm, 8, mm, and, 10, mm, the, term, ww, refers, to, the, webster, whitcomb, collet, and, lathe, invented, by, the, american, watch, tool, company, of, waltham, massachusetts, most, lathes, commonly, referred, to, as, watchmakers, lathes, are, of, this, design, in, 1909, the, american, watch, tool, company, introduced, the, magnus, type, collet, a, 10, mm, body, size, collet, using, a, lathe, of, the, same, basic, design, the, webster, whitcomb, magnus, f, w, derbyshire, inc, retains, the, trade, names, webster, whitcomb, and, magnus, and, still, produces, these, collets, two, bed, patterns, are, common, the, ww, webster, whitcomb, bed, a, truncated, triangular, prism, found, only, on, 8, and, 10, mm, watchmakers, lathes, and, the, continental, d, style, bar, bed, used, on, both, 6, mm, and, 8, mm, lathes, by, firms, such, as, lorch, and, star, other, bed, designs, have, been, used, such, as, a, triangular, prism, on, some, boley, 6, 5, mm, lathes, and, a, v, edged, bed, on, ime, s, 8, mm, lathes, smaller, metalworking, lathes, that, are, larger, than, jewelers, lathes, and, can, sit, on, a, bench, or, table, but, offer, such, features, as, tool, holders, and, a, screw, cutting, gear, train, are, called, hobby, lathes, and, larger, versions, bench, lathes, this, term, also, commonly, applied, to, a, special, type, of, high, precision, lathe, used, by, toolmakers, for, one, off, jobs, even, larger, lathes, offering, similar, features, for, producing, or, modifying, individual, parts, are, called, engine, lathes, lathes, of, these, types, do, not, have, additional, integral, features, for, repetitive, production, but, rather, are, used, for, individual, part, production, or, modification, as, the, primary, role, lathes, of, this, size, that, are, designed, for, mass, manufacture, but, not, offering, the, versatile, screw, cutting, capabilities, of, the, engine, or, bench, lathe, are, referred, to, as, second, operation, lathes, lathes, with, a, very, large, spindle, bore, and, a, chuck, on, both, ends, of, the, spindle, are, called, oil, field, lathes, fully, automatic, mechanical, lathes, employing, cams, and, gear, trains, for, controlled, movement, are, called, screw, machines, lathes, that, are, controlled, by, a, computer, are, cnc, lathes, lathes, with, the, spindle, mounted, in, a, vertical, configuration, instead, of, horizontal, configuration, are, called, vertical, lathes, or, vertical, boring, machines, they, are, used, where, very, large, diameters, must, be, turned, and, the, workpiece, comparatively, is, not, very, long, a, lathe, with, a, tool, post, that, can, rotate, around, a, vertical, axis, so, as, to, present, different, tools, towards, the, headstock, and, the, workpiece, are, turret, lathes, a, lathe, equipped, with, indexing, plates, profile, cutters, spiral, or, helical, guides, etc, so, as, to, enable, ornamental, turning, is, an, ornamental, lathe, various, combinations, are, possible, for, example, a, vertical, lathe, can, have, cnc, capabilities, as, well, such, as, a, cnc, vtl, lathes, can, be, combined, with, other, machine, tools, such, as, a, drill, press, or, vertical, milling, machine, these, are, usually, referred, to, as, combination, lathes, woodworking, lathes, are, the, oldest, variety, apart, from, pottery, wheels, all, other, varieties, are, descended, from, these, simple, lathes, an, adjustable, horizontal, metal, rail, the, tool, rest, between, the, material, and, the, operator, accommodates, the, positioning, of, shaping, tools, which, are, usually, hand, held, after, shaping, it, is, common, practice, to, press, and, slide, sandpaper, against, the, still, spinning, object, to, smooth, the, surface, made, with, the, metal, shaping, tools, the, tool, rest, is, usually, removed, during, sanding, as, it, may, be, unsafe, to, have, the, operators, hands, between, it, and, the, spinning, wood, many, woodworking, lathes, can, also, be, used, for, making, bowls, and, plates, the, bowl, or, plate, needs, only, to, be, held, at, the, bottom, by, one, side, of, the, lathe, it, is, usually, attached, to, a, metal, face, plate, attached, to, the, spindle, with, many, lathes, this, operation, happens, on, the, left, side, of, the, headstock, where, are, no, rails, and, therefore, more, clearance, in, this, configuration, the, piece, can, be, shaped, inside, and, out, a, specific, curved, tool, rest, may, be, used, to, support, tools, while, shaping, the, inside, further, detail, can, be, found, on, the, woodturning, page, most, woodworking, lathes, are, designed, to, be, operated, at, a, speed, of, between, 200, and, 1, 400, revolutions, per, minute, with, slightly, over, 1, 000, rpm, considered, optimal, for, most, such, work, and, with, larger, workpieces, requiring, lower, speeds, one, type, of, specialized, lathe, is, duplicating, or, copying, lathe, some, types, of, them, are, known, as, blanchard, lathe, after, thomas, blanchard, this, type, of, lathe, was, able, to, create, shapes, identical, to, a, standard, pattern, and, it, revolutionized, the, process, of, gun, stock, making, in, the, 1820s, when, it, was, invented, the, hermitage, museum, russia, displays, the, copying, lathe, for, ornamental, turning, making, medals, and, guilloche, patterns, designed, by, andrey, nartov, 1721, used, to, make, a, pattern, for, foundries, often, from, wood, but, also, plastics, a, patternmaker, s, lathe, looks, like, a, heavy, wood, lathe, often, with, a, turret, and, either, a, leadscrew, or, a, rack, and, pinion, to, manually, position, the, turret, the, turret, is, used, to, accurately, cut, straight, lines, they, often, have, a, provision, to, turn, very, large, parts, on, the, other, end, of, the, headstock, using, a, free, standing, toolrest, another, way, of, turning, large, parts, is, a, sliding, bed, which, can, slide, away, from, the, headstock, and, thus, open, up, a, gap, in, front, of, the, headstock, for, large, parts, in, a, metalworking, lathe, metal, is, removed, from, the, workpiece, using, a, hardened, cutting, tool, which, is, usually, fixed, to, a, solid, moveable, mounting, either, a, tool, post, or, a, turret, which, is, then, moved, against, the, workpiece, using, handwheels, or, computer, controlled, motors, these, cutting, tools, come, in, a, wide, range, of, sizes, and, shapes, depending, upon, their, application, some, common, styles, are, diamond, round, square, and, triangular, the, tool, post, is, operated, by, lead, screws, that, can, accurately, position, the, tool, in, a, variety, of, planes, the, tool, post, may, be, driven, manually, or, automatically, to, produce, the, roughing, and, finishing, cuts, required, to, turn, the, workpiece, to, the, desired, shape, and, dimensions, or, for, cutting, threads, worm, gears, etc, cutting, fluid, may, also, be, pumped, to, the, cutting, site, to, provide, cooling, lubrication, and, clearing, of, swarf, from, the, workpiece, some, lathes, may, be, operated, under, control, of, a, computer, for, mass, production, of, parts, see, computer, numerical, control, manually, controlled, metalworking, lathes, are, commonly, provided, with, a, variable, ratio, gear, train, to, drive, the, main, lead, screw, this, enables, different, thread, pitches, to, be, cut, on, some, older, lathes, or, more, affordable, new, lathes, the, gear, trains, are, changed, by, swapping, gears, with, various, numbers, of, teeth, onto, or, off, of, the, shafts, while, more, modern, or, expensive, manually, controlled, lathes, have, a, quick, change, box, to, provide, commonly, used, ratios, by, the, operation, of, a, lever, cnc, lathes, use, computers, and, servomechanisms, to, regulate, the, rates, of, movement, on, manually, controlled, lathes, the, thread, pitches, that, can, be, cut, are, in, some, ways, determined, by, the, pitch, of, the, lead, screw, a, lathe, with, a, metric, lead, screw, will, readily, cut, metric, threads, including, ba, while, one, with, an, imperial, lead, screw, will, readily, cut, imperial, unit, based, threads, such, as, bsw, or, uts, unf, unc, this, limitation, is, not, insurmountable, because, a, 127, tooth, gear, called, a, transposing, gear, is, used, to, translate, between, metric, and, inch, thread, pitches, however, this, is, optional, equipment, that, many, lathe, owners, do, not, own, it, is, also, a, larger, change, wheel, than, the, others, and, on, some, lathes, may, be, larger, than, the, change, wheel, mounting, banjo, is, capable, of, mounting, the, workpiece, may, be, supported, between, a, pair, of, points, called, centres, or, it, may, be, bolted, to, a, faceplate, or, held, in, a, chuck, a, chuck, has, movable, jaws, that, can, grip, the, workpiece, securely, there, are, some, effects, on, material, properties, when, using, a, metalworking, lathe, there, are, few, chemical, or, physical, effects, but, there, are, many, mechanical, effects, which, include, residual, stress, micro, cracks, work, hardening, and, tempering, in, hardened, materials, cue, lathes, function, similarly, to, turning, and, spinning, lathes, allowing, a, perfectly, radially, symmetrical, cut, for, billiard, cues, they, can, also, be, used, to, refinish, cues, that, have, been, worn, over, the, years, glass, working, lathes, are, similar, in, design, to, other, lathes, but, differ, markedly, in, how, the, workpiece, is, modified, glass, working, lathes, slowly, rotate, a, hollow, glass, vessel, over, a, fixed, or, variable, temperature, flame, the, source, of, the, flame, may, be, either, hand, held, or, mounted, to, a, banjo, cross, slide, that, can, be, moved, along, the, lathe, bed, the, flame, serves, to, soften, the, glass, being, worked, so, that, the, glass, in, a, specific, area, of, the, workpiece, becomes, ductile, and, subject, to, forming, either, by, inflation, glassblowing, or, by, deformation, with, a, heat, resistant, tool, such, lathes, usually, have, two, head, stocks, with, chucks, holding, the, work, arranged, so, that, they, both, rotate, together, in, unison, air, can, be, introduced, through, the, headstock, chuck, spindle, for, glassblowing, the, tools, to, deform, the, glass, and, tubes, to, blow, inflate, the, glass, are, usually, handheld, in, diamond, turning, a, computer, controlled, lathe, with, a, diamond, tipped, tool, is, used, to, make, precision, optical, surfaces, in, glass, or, other, optical, materials, unlike, conventional, optical, grinding, complex, aspheric, surfaces, can, be, machined, easily, instead, of, the, dovetailed, ways, used, on, the, tool, slide, of, a, metal, turning, lathe, the, ways, typically, float, on, air, bearings, and, the, position, of, the, tool, is, measured, by, optical, interferometry, to, achieve, the, necessary, standard, of, precision, for, optical, work, the, finished, work, piece, usually, requires, a, small, amount, of, subsequent, polishing, by, conventional, techniques, to, achieve, a, finished, surface, suitably, smooth, for, use, in, a, lens, but, the, rough, grinding, time, is, significantly, reduced, for, complex, lenses, in, metal, spinning, a, disk, of, sheet, metal, is, held, perpendicularly, to, the, main, axis, of, the, lathe, and, tools, with, polished, tips, spoons, or, roller, tips, are, hand, held, but, levered, by, hand, against, fixed, posts, to, develop, pressure, that, deforms, the, spinning, sheet, of, metal, metal, spinning, lathes, are, almost, as, simple, as, wood, turning, lathes, typically, metal, spinning, requires, a, mandrel, usually, made, from, wood, which, serves, as, the, template, onto, which, the, workpiece, is, formed, asymmetric, shapes, can, be, made, but, it, is, a, very, advanced, technique, for, example, to, make, a, sheet, metal, bowl, a, solid, block, of, wood, in, the, shape, of, the, bowl, is, required, similarly, to, make, a, vase, a, solid, template, of, the, vase, is, required, given, the, advent, of, high, speed, high, pressure, industrial, die, forming, metal, spinning, is, less, common, now, than, it, once, was, but, still, a, valuable, technique, for, producing, one, off, prototypes, or, small, batches, where, die, forming, would, be, uneconomical, the, ornamental, turning, lathe, was, developed, around, the, same, time, as, the, industrial, screw, cutting, lathe, in, the, nineteenth, century, it, was, used, not, for, making, practical, objects, but, for, decorative, work, ornamental, turning, by, using, accessories, such, as, the, horizontal, and, vertical, cutting, frames, eccentric, chuck, and, elliptical, chuck, solids, of, extraordinary, complexity, may, be, produced, by, various, generative, procedures, a, special, purpose, lathe, the, rose, engine, lathe, is, also, used, for, ornamental, turning, in, particular, for, engine, turning, typically, in, precious, metals, for, example, to, decorate, pocket, watch, cases, as, well, as, a, wide, range, of, accessories, these, lathes, usually, have, complex, dividing, arrangements, to, allow, the, exact, rotation, of, the, mandrel, cutting, is, usually, carried, out, by, rotating, cutters, rather, than, directly, by, the, rotation, of, the, work, itself, because, of, the, difficulty, of, polishing, such, work, the, materials, turned, such, as, wood, or, ivory, are, usually, quite, soft, and, the, cutter, has, to, be, exceptionally, sharp, the, finest, ornamental, lathes, are, generally, considered, to, be, those, made, by, holtzapffel, around, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, many, types, of, lathes, can, be, equipped, with, accessory, components, to, allow, them, to, reproduce, an, item, the, original, item, is, mounted, on, one, spindle, the, blank, is, mounted, on, another, and, as, both, turn, in, synchronized, manner, one, end, of, an, arm, reads, the, original, and, the, other, end, of, the, arm, carves, the, duplicate, a, reduction, lathe, is, a, specialized, lathe, that, is, designed, with, this, feature, and, incorporates, a, mechanism, similar, to, a, pantograph, so, that, when, the, reading, end, of, the, arm, reads, a, detail, that, measures, one, inch, for, example, the, cutting, end, of, the, arm, creates, an, analogous, detail, that, is, for, example, one, quarter, of, an, inch, a, 4, 1, reduction, although, given, appropriate, machinery, and, appropriate, settings, any, reduction, ratio, is, possible, reducing, lathes, are, used, in, coin, making, where, a, plaster, original, or, an, epoxy, master, made, from, the, plaster, original, or, a, copper, shelled, master, made, from, the, plaster, original, etc, is, duplicated, and, reduced, on, the, reducing, lathe, generating, a, master, die, a, lathe, in, which, wood, logs, are, turned, against, a, very, sharp, blade, and, peeled, off, in, one, continuous, or, semi, continuous, roll, invented, by, immanuel, nobel, father, of, the, more, famous, alfred, nobel, the, first, such, lathes, in, the, united, states, were, set, up, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, product, is, called, wood, veneer, and, it, is, used, for, making, plywood, and, as, a, cosmetic, surface, veneer, on, some, grades, of, chipboard, watchmakers, lathes, are, delicate, but, precise, metalworking, lathes, usually, without, provision, for, screwcutting, and, are, still, used, by, horologists, for, work, such, as, the, turning, of, balance, staffs, a, handheld, tool, called, a, graver, supported, by, a, tool, rest, is, often, used, in, preference, to, a, slide, mounted, tool, the, original, watchmaker, s, turns, was, a, simple, dead, center, lathe, with, a, moveable, rest, and, two, loose, head, stocks, the, workpiece, would, be, rotated, by, a, bow, typically, of, horsehair, wrapped, around, it, transcription, or, recording, lathes, are, used, to, make, grooves, on, a, surface, for, recording, sounds, these, were, used, in, creating, sound, grooves, on, wax, cylinders, and, then, on, flat, recording, discs, originally, also, made, of, wax, but, later, as, lacquers, on, a, substratum, originally, the, cutting, lathes, were, driven, by, sound, vibrations, through, a, horn, in, a, process, known, as, acoustic, recording, and, later, driven, by, an, electric, current, when, microphones, were, first, used, in, sound, recording, many, such, lathes, were, professional, models, but, others, were, developed, for, home, recording, and, were, common, before, the, advent, of, home, tape, recording, national, and, international, standards, are, used, to, standardize, the, definitions, environmental, requirements, and, test, methods, used, for, the, performance, evaluation, of, lathes, election, of, the, standard, to, be, used, is, an, agreement, between, the, supplier, and, the, user, and, has, some, significance, in, the, design, of, the, lathe, in, the, united, states, asme, has, developed, the, b5, 57, standard, entitled, methods, for, performance, evaluation, of, computer, numerically, controlled, lathes, and, turning, centers, which, establishes, requirements, and, methods, for, specifying, and, testing, the, performance, of, cnc, lathes, and, turning, centers
