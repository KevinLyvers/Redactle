a, detergent, is, a, surfactant, or, a, mixture, of, surfactants, with, cleansing, properties, when, in, dilute, solutions, there, are, a, large, variety, of, detergents, a, common, family, being, the, alkylbenzene, sulfonates, which, are, soap, like, compounds, that, are, more, soluble, in, hard, water, because, the, polar, sulfonate, of, detergents, is, less, likely, than, the, polar, carboxylate, of, soap, to, bind, to, calcium, and, other, ions, found, in, hard, water, the, word, detergent, is, derived, from, the, latin, adjective, detergens, from, the, verb, detergere, meaning, to, wipe, or, polish, off, detergent, can, be, defined, as, a, surfactant, or, a, mixture, of, surfactants, with, cleansing, properties, when, in, dilute, solutions, however, conventionally, detergent, is, used, to, mean, synthetic, cleaning, compounds, as, opposed, to, soap, a, salt, of, the, natural, fatty, acid, even, though, soap, is, also, a, detergent, in, the, true, sense, in, domestic, contexts, the, term, detergent, refers, to, household, cleaning, products, such, as, laundry, detergent, or, dish, detergent, which, are, in, fact, complex, mixtures, of, different, compounds, not, all, of, which, are, by, themselves, detergents, detergency, is, the, ability, to, remove, unwanted, substances, termed, soils, from, a, substrate, e, g, clothing, detergents, are, a, group, of, compounds, with, an, amphiphilic, structure, where, each, molecule, has, a, hydrophilic, polar, head, and, a, long, hydrophobic, non, polar, tail, the, hydrophobic, portion, of, these, molecules, may, be, straight, or, branched, chain, hydrocarbons, or, it, may, have, a, steroid, structure, the, hydrophilic, portion, is, more, varied, they, may, be, ionic, or, non, ionic, and, can, range, from, a, simple, or, a, relatively, elaborate, structure, detergents, are, surfactants, since, they, can, decrease, the, surface, tension, of, water, their, dual, nature, facilitates, the, mixture, of, hydrophobic, compounds, like, oil, and, grease, with, water, because, air, is, not, hydrophilic, detergents, are, also, foaming, agents, to, varying, degrees, detergent, molecules, aggregate, to, form, micelles, which, makes, them, soluble, in, water, the, hydrophobic, group, of, the, detergent, is, the, main, driving, force, of, micelle, formation, its, aggregation, forms, the, hydrophobic, core, of, the, micelles, the, micelle, can, remove, grease, protein, or, soiling, particles, the, concentration, at, which, micelles, start, to, form, is, the, critical, micelle, concentration, cmc, and, the, temperature, at, which, the, micelles, further, aggregate, to, separate, the, solution, into, two, phases, is, the, cloud, point, when, the, solution, becomes, cloudy, and, detergency, is, optimal, detergents, work, better, in, an, alkaline, ph, the, properties, of, detergents, are, dependent, on, the, molecular, structure, of, the, monomer, the, ability, to, foam, may, be, determined, by, the, head, group, for, example, anionic, surfactants, are, high, foaming, while, nonionic, surfactants, may, be, non, foaming, or, low, foaming, detergents, are, classified, into, four, broad, groupings, depending, on, the, electrical, charge, of, the, surfactants, typical, anionic, detergents, are, alkylbenzene, sulfonates, the, alkylbenzene, portion, of, these, anions, is, lipophilic, and, the, sulfonate, is, hydrophilic, two, varieties, have, been, popularized, those, with, branched, alkyl, groups, and, those, with, linear, alkyl, groups, the, former, were, largely, phased, out, in, economically, advanced, societies, because, they, are, poorly, biodegradable, anionic, detergents, is, the, most, common, form, of, detergents, and, an, estimated, 6, billion, kilograms, of, anionic, detergents, are, produced, annually, for, the, domestic, markets, bile, acids, such, as, deoxycholic, acid, doc, are, anionic, detergents, produced, by, the, liver, to, aid, in, digestion, and, absorption, of, fats, and, oils, cationic, detergents, are, similar, to, anionic, ones, but, quaternary, ammonium, replaces, the, hydrophilic, anionic, sulfonate, group, the, ammonium, sulfate, center, is, positively, charged, cationic, surfactants, generally, have, poor, detergency, non, ionic, detergents, are, characterized, by, their, uncharged, hydrophilic, headgroups, typical, non, ionic, detergents, are, based, on, polyoxyethylene, or, a, glycoside, common, examples, of, the, former, include, tween, triton, and, the, brij, series, these, materials, are, also, known, as, ethoxylates, or, pegylates, and, their, metabolites, nonylphenol, glycosides, have, a, sugar, as, their, uncharged, hydrophilic, headgroup, examples, include, octyl, thioglucoside, and, maltosides, hega, and, mega, series, detergents, are, similar, possessing, a, sugar, alcohol, as, headgroup, amphoteric, or, zwitterionic, detergents, have, zwitterions, within, a, particular, ph, range, and, possess, a, net, zero, charge, arising, from, the, presence, of, equal, numbers, of, 1, and, 1, charged, chemical, groups, examples, include, chaps, soap, is, known, to, have, been, used, as, a, surfactant, for, washing, clothes, since, the, sumerian, time, in, 2, 500, b, c, in, ancient, egypt, soda, was, used, as, a, wash, additive, in, the, 19th, century, synthetic, surfactants, began, to, be, created, for, example, from, olive, oil, sodium, silicate, water, glass, was, used, in, soap, making, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1860s, and, in, 1876, henkel, sold, a, sodium, silicate, based, product, that, can, be, used, with, soap, and, marketed, as, a, universal, detergent, universalwaschmittel, in, germany, soda, was, then, mixed, with, sodium, silicate, to, produce, germany, s, first, brand, name, detergent, bleichsoda, in, 1907, henkel, also, added, a, bleaching, agent, sodium, perborate, to, launch, the, first, self, acting, laundry, detergent, persil, to, eliminate, the, laborious, rubbing, of, laundry, by, hand, during, the, first, world, war, there, was, a, shortage, of, oils, and, fats, needed, to, make, soap, in, order, to, find, alternatives, for, soap, synthetic, detergents, were, made, in, germany, by, chemists, using, raw, material, derived, from, coal, tar, these, early, products, however, did, not, provide, sufficient, detergency, in, 1928, effective, detergent, was, made, through, the, sulfation, of, fatty, alcohol, but, large, scale, production, was, not, feasible, until, low, cost, fatty, alcohols, become, available, in, the, early, 1930s, the, synthetic, detergent, created, was, more, effective, and, less, likely, to, form, scum, than, soap, in, hard, water, and, can, also, eliminate, acid, and, alkaline, reactions, and, decompose, dirt, commercial, detergent, products, with, fatty, alcohol, sulphates, began, to, be, sold, initially, in, 1932, in, germany, by, henkel, in, the, united, states, detergents, were, sold, in, 1933, by, procter, gamble, dreft, primarily, in, areas, with, hard, water, however, sales, in, the, us, grew, slowly, until, the, introduction, of, built, detergents, with, the, addition, of, effective, phosphate, builder, developed, in, the, early, 1940s, the, builder, improves, the, performance, of, the, surfactants, by, softening, the, water, through, the, chelation, of, calcium, and, magnesium, ions, helping, to, maintain, an, alkaline, ph, as, well, as, dispersing, and, keeping, the, soiling, particles, in, solution, the, development, of, the, petrochemical, industry, after, the, second, world, war, also, yielded, material, for, the, production, of, a, range, of, synthetic, surfactants, and, alkylbenzene, sulfonates, became, the, most, important, detergent, surfactants, used, by, the, 1950s, laundry, detergents, had, become, widespread, and, largely, replaced, soap, for, cleaning, clothes, in, developed, countries, over, the, years, many, types, of, detergents, have, been, developed, for, a, variety, of, purposes, for, example, low, sudsing, detergents, for, use, in, front, loading, washing, machines, heavy, duty, detergents, effective, in, removing, grease, and, dirt, all, purpose, detergents, and, specialty, detergents, they, become, incorporated, in, various, products, outside, of, laundry, use, for, example, in, dishwasher, detergents, shampoo, toothpaste, industrial, cleaners, and, in, lubricants, and, fuels, to, reduce, or, prevent, the, formation, of, sludge, or, deposits, the, formulation, of, detergent, products, may, include, bleach, fragrances, dyes, and, other, additives, the, use, of, phosphates, in, detergent, however, led, to, concerns, over, nutrient, pollution, and, demand, for, changes, to, the, formulation, of, the, detergents, concerns, were, also, raised, over, the, use, of, surfactants, such, as, branched, alkylbenzene, sulfonate, tetrapropylenebenzene, sulfonate, that, lingers, in, the, environment, which, led, to, their, replacement, by, surfactants, that, are, more, biodegradable, such, as, linear, alkylbenzene, sulfonate, developments, over, the, years, have, included, the, use, of, enzymes, substitutes, for, phosphates, such, as, zeolite, a, and, nta, taed, as, bleach, activator, sugar, based, surfactants, which, are, biodegradable, and, milder, to, skin, and, other, green, friendly, products, as, well, as, changes, to, the, form, of, delivery, such, as, tablets, gels, and, pods, one, of, the, largest, applications, of, detergents, is, for, household, and, shop, cleaning, including, dish, washing, and, washing, laundry, these, detergents, are, commonly, available, as, powders, or, concentrated, solutions, and, the, formulations, of, these, detergents, are, often, complex, mixtures, of, a, variety, of, chemicals, aside, from, surfactants, reflecting, the, diverse, demands, of, the, application, and, the, highly, competitive, consumer, market, these, detergents, may, contain, the, following, components, both, carburetors, and, fuel, injector, components, of, internal, combustion, engines, benefit, from, detergents, in, the, fuels, to, prevent, fouling, concentrations, are, about, 300, ppm, typical, detergents, are, long, chain, amines, and, amides, such, as, polyisobuteneamine, and, polyisobuteneamide, succinimide, reagent, grade, detergents, are, employed, for, the, isolation, and, purification, of, integral, membrane, proteins, found, in, biological, cells, solubilization, of, cell, membrane, bilayers, requires, a, detergent, that, can, enter, the, inner, membrane, monolayer, advancements, in, the, purity, and, sophistication, of, detergents, have, facilitated, structural, and, biophysical, characterization, of, important, membrane, proteins, such, as, ion, channels, also, the, disrupt, membrane, by, binding, lipopolysaccharide, transporters, signaling, receptors, and, photosystem, ii
