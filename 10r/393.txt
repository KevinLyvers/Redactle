a, chisel, is, a, wedged, hand, tool, with, a, characteristically, shaped, cutting, edge, on, the, end, of, its, blade, for, carving, or, cutting, a, hard, material, e, g, wood, stone, or, metal, the, tool, can, be, used, by, hand, struck, with, a, mallet, or, applied, with, mechanical, power, the, handle, and, blade, of, some, types, of, chisel, are, made, of, metal, or, wood, with, a, sharp, edge, in, it, such, that, wood, chisels, have, lent, part, of, their, name, to, a, particular, grind, chiselling, use, involves, forcing, the, blade, into, some, material, to, cut, it, the, driving, force, may, be, applied, by, pushing, by, hand, or, by, using, a, mallet, or, hammer, in, industrial, use, a, hydraulic, ram, or, falling, weight, trip, hammer, may, be, used, to, drive, a, chisel, into, the, material, a, gouge, is, a, type, of, chisel, that, serves, to, carve, small, pieces, from, the, material, particularly, in, woodworking, woodturning, and, sculpture, gouges, most, frequently, produce, concave, surfaces, and, have, a, u, shaped, cross, section, chisel, comes, from, the, old, french, cisel, modern, ciseau, late, latin, cisellum, a, cutting, tool, from, caedere, to, cut, chisels, are, common, in, the, archeological, record, chisel, cut, materials, have, also, been, found, woodworking, chisels, range, from, small, hand, tools, for, tiny, details, to, large, chisels, used, to, remove, big, sections, of, wood, in, roughing, out, the, shape, of, a, pattern, or, design, typically, in, woodcarving, one, starts, with, a, larger, tool, and, gradually, progresses, to, smaller, tools, to, finish, the, detail, one, of, the, largest, types, of, chisel, is, the, slick, used, in, timber, frame, construction, and, wooden, shipbuilding, there, are, many, types, of, woodworking, chisels, used, for, specific, purposes, such, as, woodturners, use, a, woodworking, gouge, or, chisel, designed, to, cut, wood, as, it, is, spun, on, a, lathe, these, tools, have, longer, handles, for, more, leverage, needed, to, counteract, the, tendency, of, the, tool, to, react, to, the, downward, force, of, the, spinning, wood, being, cut, or, carved, in, addition, the, angle, and, method, of, sharpening, is, different, chisels, used, in, metal, work, can, be, divided, into, two, main, categories, hot, chisels, and, cold, chisels, a, cold, chisel, is, a, tool, made, of, tempered, steel, used, for, cutting, cold, metals, meaning, that, they, are, not, used, in, conjunction, with, heating, torches, forges, etc, cold, chisels, are, used, to, remove, waste, metal, when, a, very, smooth, finish, is, not, required, or, when, the, work, cannot, be, done, easily, with, other, tools, such, as, a, hacksaw, file, bench, shears, or, power, tools, the, name, cold, chisel, comes, from, its, use, by, blacksmiths, to, cut, metal, while, it, was, cold, as, compared, to, other, tools, they, used, to, cut, hot, metal, because, cold, chisels, are, used, to, form, metal, they, have, a, less, acute, angle, to, the, sharp, portion, of, the, blade, than, a, woodworking, chisel, this, gives, the, cutting, edge, greater, strength, at, the, expense, of, sharpness, cold, chisels, come, in, a, variety, of, sizes, from, fine, engraving, tools, that, are, tapped, with, very, light, hammers, to, massive, tools, that, are, driven, with, sledgehammers, cold, chisels, are, forged, to, shape, and, hardened, and, tempered, to, a, blue, colour, at, the, cutting, edge, the, head, of, the, chisel, is, chamfered, to, slow, down, the, formation, of, the, mushroom, shape, caused, by, hammering, and, is, left, soft, to, avoid, brittle, fracture, splintering, from, hammer, blows, there, are, four, common, types, of, cold, chisels, these, are, the, flat, chisel, the, most, widely, known, type, which, is, used, to, cut, bars, and, rods, to, reduce, surfaces, and, to, cut, sheet, metal, that, is, too, thick, or, difficult, to, cut, with, tin, snips, the, cross, cut, chisel, is, used, for, cutting, grooves, and, slots, the, blade, narrows, behind, the, cutting, edge, to, provide, clearance, the, round, nose, chisel, is, used, for, cutting, semi, circular, grooves, for, oil, ways, in, bearings, the, diamond, point, chisel, is, used, for, cleaning, out, corners, or, difficult, places, and, pulling, over, centre, punch, marks, wrongly, placed, for, drilling, although, the, vast, majority, of, cold, chisels, are, made, of, steel, a, few, are, manufactured, from, beryllium, copper, for, use, in, special, situations, where, non, sparking, tools, are, required, cold, chisels, are, predominantly, used, in, repouss, and, chasing, processes, for, the, fabrication, of, bronze, and, aluminium, sculptures, a, hot, chisel, is, used, to, cut, metal, that, has, been, heated, in, a, forge, to, soften, the, metal, one, type, of, hot, chisel, is, the, hotcut, hardy, which, is, used, in, an, anvil, hardy, hole, with, the, cutting, edge, facing, up, the, hot, workpiece, to, be, cut, is, placed, over, the, chisel, and, struck, with, a, hammer, the, hammer, drives, the, workpiece, into, the, chisel, which, allows, it, to, be, snapped, off, with, a, pair, of, tongs, this, tool, is, also, often, used, in, combination, with, a, top, fuller, type, of, hotcut, when, the, piece, being, cut, is, particularly, large, stone, chisels, are, used, to, carve, or, cut, stone, bricks, or, concrete, slabs, to, cut, as, opposed, to, carve, a, brick, bolster, is, used, this, has, a, wide, flat, blade, that, is, tapped, along, the, cut, line, to, produce, a, groove, then, hit, hard, in, the, centre, to, crack, the, stone, sculptors, use, a, spoon, chisel, which, is, bent, with, the, bevel, on, both, sides, to, increase, the, force, stone, chisels, are, often, hit, with, club, hammers, a, heavier, type, of, hammer, masonry, chisels, are, typically, heavy, with, a, relatively, dull, head, that, wedges, and, breaks, rather, than, cuts, often, used, as, a, demolition, tool, they, may, be, mounted, on, a, hammer, drill, jackhammer, or, hammered, manually, usually, with, a, heavy, hammer, of, three, pounds, or, more, these, chisels, normally, have, an, sds, sds, max, or, 1, 1, 8, hex, connection, types, of, masonry, chisels, include, the, following, a, plugging, chisel, has, a, tapered, edge, for, cleaning, out, hardened, mortar, the, chisel, is, held, with, one, hand, and, struck, with, a, hammer, the, direction, of, the, taper, in, the, blade, determines, if, the, chisel, cuts, deep, or, runs, shallow, along, the, joint, in, leather, work, a, chisel, is, a, tool, used, to, punch, holes, in, a, piece, leather, the, chisel, has, between, one, and, seven, or, possibly, more, tines, that, are, carefully, placed, along, the, line, where, the, holes, are, desired, and, then, the, top, of, the, chisel, is, struck, with, a, hammer, until, the, tines, penetrate, the, leather, they, are, then, withdrawn, and, the, leatherworker, then, stitches, through, the, resulting, holes, a, modern, gouge, is, similar, to, a, chisel, except, its, blade, edge, is, not, flat, but, instead, is, curved, or, angled, in, cross, section, the, modern, version, is, generally, hafted, inline, the, blade, and, handle, typically, having, the, same, long, axis, if, the, bevel, of, the, blade, is, on, the, outer, surface, of, the, curve, the, gouge, is, called, an, outcannel, gouge, otherwise, it, is, known, as, an, incannel, gouge, gouges, with, angled, rather, than, curved, blades, are, often, called, v, gouges, or, vee, parting, tools, the, blade, geometry, is, defined, by, a, semi, standardized, numbering, system, that, varies, by, manufacturer, and, country, of, origin, for, each, gouge, a, sweep, number, is, specified, that, expresses, the, part, of, a, circle, defined, by, the, curve, of, the, blade, the, sweep, number, usually, ranges, from, 1, or, flat, up, to, 9, a, semi, circle, with, additional, specialized, gouges, at, higher, numbers, such, as, the, u, shaped, 11, and, a, v, tool, or, parting, tool, which, may, be, an, even, higher, number, such, as, 41, in, addition, to, sweep, gouges, are, also, specified, by, the, distance, from, one, edge, of, the, blade, to, the, other, this, corresponds, to, the, chord, of, the, circle, section, defined, by, the, edge, of, the, blade, putting, these, pieces, together, two, numbers, are, used, to, specify, the, shape, of, the, cutting, edge, of, a, gouge, such, as, a, 7, 20mm, some, manufacturers, provide, charts, with, the, sweeps, of, their, blades, shown, graphically, in, addition, to, varying, blade, sweeps, bevels, and, widths, blade, variations, include, all, of, these, specialized, gouges, allow, a, craftsperson, to, cut, into, areas, that, may, not, be, possible, with, a, regular, straight, bladed, gouge, the, cutting, shape, of, a, gouge, may, also, be, held, in, an, adze, roughly, as, the, shape, of, a, modern, day, mattock, gouges, are, used, in, woodworking, and, arts, for, example, a, violin, luthier, uses, gouges, to, carve, the, violin, a, cabinetmaker, may, use, it, for, running, flutes, or, paring, curves, or, an, artist, may, produce, a, piece, of, art, by, cutting, some, bits, out, of, a, sheet, of, linoleum, see, also, linocut, gouges, were, found, at, a, number, of, historic, bronze, age, hoards, found, in, great, britain
