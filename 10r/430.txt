a, centrifuge, is, a, device, that, uses, centrifugal, force, to, subject, a, specimen, to, a, specified, constant, force, for, example, to, separate, various, components, of, a, fluid, this, is, achieved, by, spinning, the, fluid, at, high, speed, within, a, container, thereby, separating, fluids, of, different, densities, e, g, cream, from, milk, or, liquids, from, solids, it, works, by, causing, denser, substances, and, particles, to, move, outward, in, the, radial, direction, at, the, same, time, objects, that, are, less, dense, are, displaced, and, moved, to, the, centre, in, a, laboratory, centrifuge, that, uses, sample, tubes, the, radial, acceleration, causes, denser, particles, to, settle, to, the, bottom, of, the, tube, while, low, density, substances, rise, to, the, top, a, centrifuge, can, be, a, very, effective, filter, that, separates, contaminants, from, the, main, body, of, fluid, industrial, scale, centrifuges, are, commonly, used, in, manufacturing, and, waste, processing, to, sediment, suspended, solids, or, to, separate, immiscible, liquids, an, example, is, the, cream, separator, found, in, dairies, very, high, speed, centrifuges, and, ultracentrifuges, able, to, provide, very, high, accelerations, can, separate, fine, particles, down, to, the, nano, scale, and, molecules, of, different, masses, large, centrifuges, are, used, to, simulate, high, gravity, or, acceleration, environments, for, example, high, g, training, for, test, pilots, medium, sized, centrifuges, are, used, in, washing, machines, and, at, some, swimming, pools, to, draw, water, out, of, fabrics, gas, centrifuges, are, used, for, isotope, separation, such, as, to, enrich, nuclear, fuel, for, fissile, isotopes, english, military, engineer, benjamin, robins, 1707, 1751, invented, a, whirling, arm, apparatus, to, determine, drag, in, 1864, antonin, prandtl, proposed, the, idea, of, a, dairy, centrifuge, to, separate, cream, from, milk, the, idea, was, subsequently, put, into, practice, by, his, brother, alexander, prandtl, who, made, improvements, to, his, brother, s, design, and, exhibited, a, working, butterfat, extraction, machine, in, 1875, a, centrifuge, machine, can, be, described, as, a, machine, with, a, rapidly, rotating, container, that, applies, centrifugal, force, to, its, contents, there, are, multiple, types, of, centrifuge, which, can, be, classified, by, intended, use, or, by, rotor, design, types, by, rotor, design, types, by, intended, use, industrial, centrifuges, may, otherwise, be, classified, according, to, the, type, of, separation, of, the, high, density, fraction, from, the, low, density, one, generally, there, are, two, types, of, centrifuges, the, filtration, and, sedimentation, centrifuges, for, the, filtration, or, the, so, called, screen, centrifuge, the, drum, is, perforated, and, is, inserted, with, a, filter, for, example, a, filter, cloth, wire, mesh, or, lot, screen, the, suspension, flows, through, the, filter, and, the, drum, with, the, perforated, wall, from, the, inside, to, the, outside, in, this, way, the, solid, material, is, restrained, and, can, be, removed, the, kind, of, removing, depends, on, the, type, of, centrifuge, for, example, manually, or, periodically, common, types, are, in, the, centrifuges, the, drum, is, a, solid, wall, not, perforated, this, type, of, centrifuge, is, used, for, the, purification, of, a, suspension, for, the, acceleration, of, the, natural, deposition, process, of, suspension, the, centrifuges, use, centrifugal, force, with, so, called, overflow, centrifuges, the, suspension, is, drained, off, and, the, liquid, is, added, constantly, common, types, are, though, most, modern, centrifuges, are, electrically, powered, a, hand, powered, variant, inspired, by, the, whirligig, has, been, developed, for, medical, applications, in, developing, countries, many, designs, have, been, shared, for, free, and, open, source, centrifuges, that, can, be, digitally, manufactured, the, open, source, hardware, designs, for, hand, powered, centrifuge, for, larger, volumes, of, fluids, with, a, radial, velocity, of, over, 1750, rpm, and, over, 50, n, of, relative, centrifugal, force, can, be, completely, 3, d, printed, for, about, 25, other, open, hardware, designs, use, custom, 3, d, printed, fixtures, with, inexpensive, electric, motors, to, make, low, cost, centrifuges, e, g, the, dremelfuge, that, uses, a, dremel, power, tool, or, cnc, cut, out, openfuge, a, wide, variety, of, laboratory, scale, centrifuges, are, used, in, chemistry, biology, biochemistry, and, clinical, medicine, for, isolating, and, separating, suspensions, and, immiscible, liquids, they, vary, widely, in, speed, capacity, temperature, control, and, other, characteristics, laboratory, centrifuges, often, can, accept, a, range, of, different, fixed, angle, and, swinging, bucket, rotors, able, to, carry, different, numbers, of, centrifuge, tubes, and, rated, for, specific, maximum, speeds, controls, vary, from, simple, electrical, timers, to, programmable, models, able, to, control, acceleration, and, deceleration, rates, running, speeds, and, temperature, regimes, ultracentrifuges, spin, the, rotors, under, vacuum, eliminating, air, resistance, and, enabling, exact, temperature, control, zonal, rotors, and, continuous, flow, systems, are, capable, of, handing, bulk, and, larger, sample, volumes, respectively, in, a, laboratory, scale, instrument, an, application, in, laboratories, is, blood, separation, blood, separates, into, cells, and, proteins, rbc, wbc, platelets, etc, and, serum, dna, preparation, is, another, common, application, for, pharmacogenetics, and, clinical, diagnosis, dna, samples, are, purified, and, the, dna, is, prepped, for, separation, by, adding, buffers, and, then, centrifuging, it, for, a, certain, amount, of, time, the, blood, waste, is, then, removed, and, another, buffer, is, added, and, spun, inside, the, centrifuge, again, once, the, blood, waste, is, removed, and, another, buffer, is, added, the, pellet, can, be, suspended, and, cooled, proteins, can, then, be, removed, and, the, entire, thing, can, be, centrifuged, again, and, the, dna, can, be, isolated, completely, specialized, cytocentrifuges, are, used, in, medical, and, biological, laboratories, to, concentrate, cells, for, microscopic, examination, other, centrifuges, the, first, being, the, zippe, type, centrifuge, separate, isotopes, and, these, kinds, of, centrifuges, are, in, use, in, nuclear, power, and, nuclear, weapon, programs, human, centrifuges, are, exceptionally, large, centrifuges, that, test, the, reactions, and, tolerance, of, pilots, and, astronauts, to, acceleration, above, those, experienced, in, the, earth, s, gravity, the, first, centrifuges, used, for, human, research, were, used, by, erasmus, darwin, the, grandfather, of, charles, darwin, the, first, large, scale, human, centrifuge, designed, for, aeronautical, training, was, created, in, germany, in, 1933, the, us, air, force, at, brooks, city, base, texas, operates, a, human, centrifuge, while, awaiting, completion, of, the, new, human, centrifuge, in, construction, at, wright, patterson, afb, ohio, the, centrifuge, at, brooks, city, base, is, operated, by, the, united, states, air, force, school, of, aerospace, medicine, for, the, purpose, of, training, and, evaluating, prospective, fighter, pilots, for, high, g, flight, in, air, force, fighter, aircraft, the, use, of, large, centrifuges, to, simulate, a, feeling, of, gravity, has, been, proposed, for, future, long, duration, space, missions, exposure, to, this, simulated, gravity, would, prevent, or, reduce, the, bone, decalcification, and, muscle, atrophy, that, affect, individuals, exposed, to, long, periods, of, freefall, non, human, centrifuge, at, the, european, space, agency, esa, technology, center, estec, in, noordwijk, the, netherlands, an, 8, metre, 26, ft, diameter, centrifuge, is, used, to, expose, samples, in, fields, of, life, sciences, as, well, as, physical, sciences, this, large, diameter, centrifuge, ldc, began, operation, in, 2007, samples, can, be, exposed, to, a, maximum, of, 20, times, earth, s, gravity, with, its, four, arms, and, six, freely, swinging, out, gondolas, it, is, possible, to, expose, samples, with, different, g, levels, at, the, same, time, gondolas, can, be, fixed, at, eight, different, positions, depending, on, their, locations, one, could, e, g, run, an, experiment, at, 5, and, 10g, in, the, same, run, each, gondola, can, hold, an, experiment, of, a, maximum, 80, kilograms, 180, lb, experiments, performed, in, this, facility, ranged, from, zebra, fish, metal, alloys, plasma, cells, liquids, planaria, drosophila, or, plants, industrial, centrifugal, separator, is, a, coolant, filtration, system, for, separating, particles, from, liquid, like, grinding, machining, coolant, it, is, usually, used, for, non, ferrous, particles, separation, such, as, silicon, glass, ceramic, and, graphite, etc, the, filtering, process, does, not, require, any, consumption, parts, like, filter, bags, which, saves, the, earth, from, harm, geotechnical, centrifuge, modeling, is, used, for, physical, testing, of, models, involving, soils, centrifuge, acceleration, is, applied, to, scale, models, to, scale, the, gravitational, acceleration, and, enable, prototype, scale, stresses, to, be, obtained, in, scale, models, problems, such, as, building, and, bridge, foundations, earth, dams, tunnels, and, slope, stability, including, effects, such, as, blast, loading, and, earthquake, shaking, high, gravity, conditions, generated, by, centrifuge, are, applied, in, the, chemical, industry, casting, and, material, synthesis, the, convection, and, mass, transfer, are, greatly, affected, by, the, gravitational, condition, researchers, reported, that, the, high, gravity, level, can, effectively, affect, the, phase, composition, and, morphology, of, the, products, protocols, for, centrifugation, typically, specify, the, amount, of, acceleration, to, be, applied, to, the, sample, rather, than, specifying, a, rotational, speed, such, as, revolutions, per, minute, this, distinction, is, important, because, two, rotors, with, different, diameters, running, at, the, same, rotational, speed, will, subject, samples, to, different, accelerations, during, circular, motion, the, acceleration, is, the, product, of, the, radius, and, the, square, of, the, angular, velocity, displaystyle, omega, and, the, acceleration, relative, to, g, is, traditionally, named, relative, centrifugal, force, rcf, the, acceleration, is, measured, in, multiples, of, g, or, g, the, standard, acceleration, due, to, gravity, at, the, earth, s, surface, a, dimensionless, quantity, given, by, the, expression, where, this, relationship, may, be, written, as, or, where, to, avoid, having, to, perform, a, mathematical, calculation, every, time, one, can, find, nomograms, for, converting, rcf, to, rpm, for, a, rotor, of, a, given, radius, a, ruler, or, other, straight, edge, lined, up, with, the, radius, on, one, scale, and, the, desired, rcf, on, another, scale, will, point, at, the, correct, rpm, on, the, third, scale, based, on, automatic, rotor, recognition, modern, centrifuges, have, a, button, for, automatic, conversion, from, rcf, to, rpm, and, vice, versa
