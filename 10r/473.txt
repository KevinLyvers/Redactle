a, wheelchair, is, a, mobilized, form, of, chair, using, 2, or, more, wheels, a, footrest, and, an, armrest, usually, cushioned, it, is, used, when, walking, is, difficult, or, impossible, to, do, due, to, illnesses, injury, disabilities, or, age, related, health, conditions, wheelchairs, provide, mobility, postural, support, and, freedom, to, those, who, cannot, walk, or, have, difficulty, walking, enabling, them, to, move, around, participate, in, everyday, activities, and, live, life, on, their, own, terms, wheelchairs, come, in, a, wide, variety, of, formats, to, meet, the, specific, needs, of, their, users, they, may, include, specialized, seating, adaptions, and, individualized, controls, and, may, be, specific, to, particular, activities, as, with, sports, wheelchairs, and, beach, wheelchairs, the, most, widely, recognized, distinction, is, between, motorized, wheelchairs, where, propulsion, is, provided, by, batteries, and, electric, motors, and, manual, wheelchairs, where, the, propulsive, force, is, provided, either, by, the, wheelchair, user, or, occupant, pushing, the, wheelchair, by, hand, self, propelled, by, an, attendant, pushing, from, the, rear, using, the, handle, s, or, by, an, attendant, pushing, from, the, side, use, a, handle, attachment, the, earliest, records, of, wheeled, furniture, are, an, inscription, found, on, a, stone, slate, in, china, and, a, child, s, bed, depicted, in, a, frieze, on, a, greek, vase, both, dating, between, the, 6th, and, 5th, century, bc, the, first, records, of, wheeled, seats, being, used, for, transporting, disabled, people, date, to, three, centuries, later, in, china, the, chinese, used, early, wheelbarrows, to, move, people, as, well, as, heavy, objects, a, distinction, between, the, two, functions, was, not, made, for, another, several, hundred, years, until, around, ad, 525, when, images, of, wheeled, chairs, made, specifically, to, carry, people, began, to, occur, in, chinese, art, although, europeans, eventually, developed, a, similar, design, this, method, of, transportation, did, not, exist, until, 1595, when, an, unknown, inventor, from, spain, built, one, for, king, phillip, ii, although, it, was, an, elaborate, chair, having, both, armrests, and, leg, rests, the, design, still, had, shortcomings, since, it, did, not, feature, an, efficient, propulsion, mechanism, and, thus, required, assistance, to, propel, it, this, makes, the, design, more, comparable, to, a, modern, day, highchair, or, portable, throne, for, the, wealthy, than, to, a, modern, day, wheelchair, for, disabled, people, in, 1655, stephan, farffler, a, 22, year, old, paraplegic, watchmaker, built, the, world, s, first, self, propelling, chair, on, a, three, wheel, chassis, using, a, system, of, cranks, and, cogwheels, however, the, device, resembled, a, hand, bike, more, than, a, wheelchair, since, the, design, included, hand, cranks, mounted, at, the, front, wheel, a, self, propelled, wheelchair, was, made, for, the, parliamentarian, commander, in, chief, sir, thomas, fairfax, due, to, the, many, injuries, he, had, received, during, the, english, civil, war, and, he, used, it, during, the, final, years, of, his, life, the, wheelchair, of, thomas, fairfax, is, currently, on, display, at, the, national, civil, war, centre, in, newark, on, trent, the, invalid, carriage, or, bath, chair, brought, the, technology, into, more, common, use, from, around, 1760, in, 1887, wheelchairs, rolling, chairs, were, introduced, to, atlantic, city, so, invalid, tourists, could, rent, them, to, enjoy, the, boardwalk, soon, many, healthy, tourists, also, rented, the, decorated, rolling, chairs, and, servants, to, push, them, as, a, show, of, decadence, and, treatment, they, could, never, experience, at, home, in, 1933, harry, c, jennings, sr, and, his, disabled, friend, herbert, everest, both, mechanical, engineers, invented, the, first, lightweight, steel, folding, portable, wheelchair, everest, had, previously, broken, his, back, in, a, mining, accident, everest, and, jennings, saw, the, business, potential, of, the, invention, and, went, on, to, become, the, first, mass, market, manufacturer, of, wheelchairs, their, x, brace, design, is, still, in, common, use, albeit, with, updated, materials, and, other, improvements, the, x, brace, idea, came, to, jennings, from, the, men, s, folding, camp, chairs, stools, rotated, 90, degrees, used, in, the, outdoors, and, at, the, mines, there, are, a, wide, variety, of, types, of, wheelchairs, differing, by, propulsion, method, mechanisms, of, control, and, technology, used, some, wheelchairs, are, designed, for, general, everyday, use, others, for, single, activities, or, to, address, specific, access, needs, innovation, within, the, wheelchair, industry, is, relatively, common, but, many, innovations, ultimately, fall, by, the, wayside, either, from, over, specialization, or, from, failing, to, come, to, market, at, an, accessible, price, point, the, ibot, is, perhaps, the, best, known, example, of, this, in, recent, years, a, self, propelled, manual, wheelchair, incorporates, a, frame, seat, one, or, two, footplates, footrests, and, four, wheels, usually, two, caster, wheels, at, the, front, and, two, large, wheels, at, the, back, there, will, generally, also, be, a, separate, seat, cushion, the, larger, rear, wheels, usually, have, push, rims, of, slightly, smaller, diameter, projecting, just, beyond, the, tyre, these, allow, the, user, to, manoeuvre, the, chair, by, pushing, on, them, without, requiring, them, to, grasp, the, tyres, manual, wheelchairs, generally, have, brakes, that, bear, on, the, tyres, of, the, rear, wheels, however, these, are, solely, a, parking, brakes, and, in, motion, braking, is, provided, by, the, user, s, palms, bearing, directly, on, the, push, rims, as, this, causes, friction, and, heat, build, up, particularly, on, long, downslopes, many, wheelchair, users, will, choose, to, wear, padded, wheelchair, gloves, manual, wheelchairs, often, have, two, push, handles, at, the, upper, rear, of, the, frame, to, allow, for, manual, propulsion, by, a, second, person, however, many, active, wheelchair, users, will, remove, these, to, prevent, unwanted, pushing, from, people, who, believe, they, are, being, helpful, everyday, manual, wheelchairs, come, in, two, major, varieties, folding, or, rigid, folding, chairs, are, generally, low, end, designs, whose, predominant, advantage, is, being, able, to, fold, generally, by, bringing, the, two, sides, together, this, is, an, advantage, for, people, who, need, to, store, the, wheelchair, frequently, or, to, put, it, in, a, small, vehicle, rigid, wheelchairs, have, permanently, welded, joints, and, many, fewer, moving, parts, this, reduces, the, energy, required, to, push, the, chair, by, eliminating, many, points, where, the, chair, would, flex, and, absorb, energy, as, it, moves, welded, rather, than, folding, joints, also, reduce, the, overall, weight, of, the, chair, rigid, chairs, typically, feature, instant, release, rear, wheels, and, backrests, that, fold, down, flat, allowing, the, user, to, dismantle, the, chair, quickly, for, storage, in, a, car, a, few, wheelchairs, attempt, to, combine, the, features, of, both, designs, by, providing, a, fold, to, rigid, mechanism, in, which, the, joints, are, mechanically, locked, when, the, wheelchair, is, in, use, many, rigid, models, are, made, with, light, materials, such, as, aluminium, and, titanium, and, wheelchairs, of, composite, materials, such, as, carbon, fibre, have, started, to, appear, ultra, lightweight, rigid, wheelchairs, are, commonly, known, as, active, user, chairs, as, they, are, ideally, suited, to, independent, use, another, innovation, in, rigid, chair, design, is, the, installation, of, shock, absorbers, such, as, frog, legs, which, cushion, the, bumps, over, which, the, chair, rolls, these, shock, absorbers, may, be, added, to, the, front, wheels, to, the, rear, wheels, or, both, rigid, chairs, also, have, the, option, for, their, rear, wheels, to, have, a, camber, or, tilt, which, angles, the, tops, of, the, wheels, in, toward, the, chair, this, allows, for, more, mechanically, efficient, propulsion, by, the, user, and, also, makes, it, easier, to, hold, a, straight, line, while, moving, across, a, slope, sport, wheelchairs, often, have, large, camber, angles, to, improve, stability, rigid, framed, chairs, are, generally, made, to, measure, to, suit, both, the, specific, size, of, the, user, and, their, needs, and, preferences, around, areas, such, as, the, tippyness, of, the, chair, determined, by, the, distance, between, the, center, of, gravity, and, the, rear, axle, experienced, users, with, sufficient, upper, body, strength, can, generally, balance, the, chair, on, its, rear, wheels, a, wheelie, and, the, tippyness, of, the, chair, controls, the, ease, with, which, this, can, be, initiated, the, wheelie, allows, an, independent, wheelchair, user, to, climb, and, descend, curbs, and, move, more, easily, over, small, obstacles, and, irregular, ground, such, as, cobbles, the, rear, wheels, of, self, propelled, wheelchairs, typically, range, from, 20, 24, in, 510, 610, mm, in, diameter, and, commonly, resemble, bicycle, wheels, wheels, are, rubber, tired, and, may, be, solid, pneumatic, or, gel, filled, the, wheels, of, folding, chairs, may, be, permanently, attached, but, those, for, rigid, chairs, are, commonly, fitted, with, quick, release, axles, activated, by, depressing, a, button, at, the, centre, of, the, wheel, all, major, varieties, of, wheelchairs, can, be, highly, customized, for, the, user, s, needs, such, customization, may, encompass, the, seat, dimensions, height, seat, angle, footplates, leg, rests, front, caster, outriggers, adjustable, backrests, and, controls, various, optional, accessories, are, available, such, as, anti, tip, bars, or, wheels, safety, belts, adjustable, backrests, tilt, and, or, recline, features, extra, support, for, limbs, or, head, and, neck, holders, for, crutches, walkers, or, oxygen, tanks, drink, holders, and, mud, and, wheel, guards, as, clothing, protectors, light, weight, and, high, costs, are, related, to, the, manual, wheelchair, market, at, the, low, cost, end, heavy, folding, steel, chairs, with, sling, seats, and, little, adaptability, dominate, users, may, be, temporarily, disabled, or, using, such, a, chair, as, a, loaner, or, simply, unable, to, afford, better, these, chairs, are, common, as, loaners, at, large, facilities, such, as, airports, amusement, parks, and, shopping, centers, a, slightly, higher, price, band, sees, the, same, folding, design, produced, in, aluminium, the, high, end, of, the, market, contains, ultra, light, models, extensive, seating, options, and, accessories, all, terrain, features, and, so, forth, the, most, expensive, manual, chairs, may, rival, the, cost, of, a, small, car, an, attendant, propelled, wheelchair, also, known, as, a, companion, or, transfer, chair, is, generally, similar, to, a, self, propelled, manual, wheelchair, but, with, small, diameter, wheels, at, both, front, and, rear, the, chair, is, maneuvered, and, controlled, by, a, person, standing, at, the, rear, and, pushing, on, handles, incorporated, into, the, frame, braking, is, supplied, directly, by, the, attendant, who, will, usually, also, be, provided, with, a, foot, or, hand, operated, parking, brake, these, chairs, are, common, in, institutional, settings, and, as, loaner, chairs, in, large, public, venues, they, are, usually, constructed, from, steel, as, light, weight, is, less, of, a, concern, when, the, user, is, not, required, to, self, propel, specially, designed, transfer, chairs, are, now, required, features, at, airports, in, much, of, the, developed, world, in, order, to, allow, access, down, narrow, airliner, aisles, and, facilitate, the, transfer, of, wheelchair, using, passengers, to, and, from, their, seats, on, the, aircraft, an, electric, powered, wheelchair, commonly, called, a, powerchair, is, a, wheelchair, that, additionally, incorporates, batteries, and, electric, motors, into, the, frame, and, that, is, controlled, by, either, the, user, or, an, attendant, most, commonly, via, a, small, joystick, mounted, on, the, armrest, or, on, the, upper, rear, of, the, frame, alternatives, exist, for, the, traditional, manual, joystick, including, head, switches, chin, operated, joysticks, sip, and, puff, controllers, or, other, specialist, controls, which, may, allow, independent, operation, of, the, wheelchair, for, a, wider, population, of, users, with, varying, motor, impairments, ranges, of, over, 10, miles, 15, km, are, commonly, available, from, standard, batteries, powerchairs, are, commonly, divided, by, their, access, capabilities, an, indoor, chair, may, only, reliably, be, able, to, cross, completely, flat, surfaces, limiting, them, to, household, use, an, indoor, outdoor, chair, is, less, limited, but, may, have, restricted, range, or, ability, to, deal, with, slopes, or, uneven, surfaces, an, outdoor, chair, is, more, capable, but, will, still, have, a, very, restricted, ability, to, deal, with, rough, terrain, a, very, few, specialist, designs, offer, a, true, cross, country, capability, powerchairs, have, access, to, the, full, range, of, wheelchair, options, including, ones, that, are, difficult, to, provide, in, an, unpowered, manual, chair, but, have, the, disadvantage, of, significant, extra, weight, where, an, ultra, lightweight, manual, chair, may, weigh, under, 10, kg, the, largest, outdoor, power, chairs, may, weigh, 200, kg, or, more, smaller, power, chairs, often, have, four, wheels, with, front, or, rear, wheel, drive, but, large, outdoor, designs, commonly, have, six, wheels, with, small, wheels, at, front, and, rear, and, somewhat, larger, powered, wheels, in, the, centre, a, power, assisted, wheelchair, is, a, recent, development, that, uses, the, frame, and, seating, of, a, typical, rigid, manual, chair, while, replacing, the, standard, rear, wheels, with, wheels, of, similar, size, which, incorporate, batteries, and, battery, powered, motors, in, the, hubs, a, floating, rim, design, senses, the, pressure, applied, by, the, user, s, push, and, activates, the, motors, proportionately, to, provide, a, power, assist, this, results, in, the, convenience, and, small, size, of, a, manual, chair, while, providing, motorised, assistance, for, rough, uneven, terrain, and, steep, slopes, that, would, otherwise, be, difficult, or, impossible, to, navigate, especially, by, those, with, limited, upper, body, function, as, the, wheels, necessarily, come, at, a, weight, penalty, it, is, often, possible, to, exchange, them, with, standard, wheels, to, match, the, capabilities, of, the, wheelchair, to, the, current, activity, mobility, scooters, share, some, features, with, powerchairs, but, primarily, address, a, different, market, segment, people, with, a, limited, ability, to, walk, but, who, might, not, otherwise, consider, themselves, disabled, smaller, mobility, scooters, are, typically, three, wheeled, with, a, base, on, which, is, mounted, a, basic, seat, at, the, rear, with, a, control, tiller, at, the, front, larger, scooters, are, frequently, four, wheeled, with, a, much, more, substantial, seat, opinions, are, often, polarized, as, to, whether, mobility, scooters, should, be, considered, wheelchairs, or, not, and, negative, stereotyping, of, scooter, users, can, be, worse, than, for, some, manual, or, power, chair, users, some, commercial, organisations, draw, a, distinction, between, power, chairs, and, scooters, when, making, access, provisions, due, to, a, lack, of, clarity, in, the, law, as, to, whether, scooters, fall, under, the, same, equality, legislation, as, wheelchairs, one, arm, or, single, arm, drive, enables, a, user, to, self, propel, a, manual, wheelchair, using, only, a, single, arm, the, large, wheel, on, the, same, side, as, the, arm, to, be, used, is, fitted, with, two, concentric, handrims, one, of, smaller, diameter, than, the, other, on, most, models, the, outer, smaller, rim, is, connected, to, the, wheel, on, the, opposite, side, by, an, inner, concentric, axle, when, both, handrims, are, grasped, together, the, chair, may, be, propelled, forward, or, backward, in, a, straight, line, when, either, handrim, is, moved, independently, only, a, single, wheel, is, used, and, the, chair, will, turn, left, or, right, in, response, to, the, handrim, used, some, wheelchairs, designed, for, use, by, hemiplegics, provide, a, similar, function, by, linking, both, wheels, rigidly, together, and, using, one, of, the, footplates, to, control, steering, via, a, linkage, to, the, front, caster, reclining, or, tilt, in, space, wheelchairs, have, seating, surfaces, that, can, be, tilted, to, various, angles, the, original, concept, was, developed, by, an, orthotist, hugh, barclay, who, worked, with, disabled, children, and, observed, that, postural, deformities, such, as, scoliosis, could, be, supported, or, partially, corrected, by, allowing, the, wheelchair, user, to, relax, in, a, tilted, position, the, feature, is, also, of, value, to, users, who, are, unable, to, sit, upright, for, extended, periods, for, pain, or, other, reasons, in, the, case, of, reclining, wheelchairs, the, seat, back, tilts, back, and, the, leg, rests, can, be, raised, while, the, seat, base, remains, in, the, same, position, somewhat, similar, to, a, common, recliner, chair, some, reclining, wheelchairs, lean, back, far, enough, that, the, user, can, lie, down, completely, flat, reclining, wheelchairs, are, preferred, in, some, cases, for, some, medical, purposes, such, as, reducing, the, risk, of, pressure, sores, providing, passive, movement, of, hip, and, knee, joints, and, making, it, easier, to, perform, some, nursing, procedures, such, as, intermittent, catheterization, to, empty, the, bladder, and, transfers, to, beds, and, also, for, personal, reasons, such, as, people, who, like, using, an, attached, tray, the, use, of, reclining, wheelchairs, is, particularly, common, among, people, with, spinal, cord, injuries, such, as, quadriplegia, in, the, case, of, tilting, wheelchairs, the, seat, back, seat, base, and, leg, rests, tilt, back, as, one, unit, somewhat, similar, to, the, way, a, person, might, tip, a, four, legged, chair, backward, to, balance, it, on, the, back, legs, while, fully, reclining, spreads, the, person, s, weight, over, the, entire, back, side, of, the, body, tilting, wheelchairs, transfer, it, from, only, the, buttocks, and, thighs, in, the, seated, position, to, partially, on, the, back, and, head, in, the, tilted, position, tilting, wheelchairs, are, preferred, for, people, who, use, molded, or, contoured, seats, who, need, to, maintain, a, particular, posture, who, adversely, affected, by, sheer, forces, reclining, causes, the, body, to, slide, slightly, every, time, or, who, need, to, keep, a, communication, device, powered, wheelchair, controls, or, other, attached, device, in, the, same, relative, position, throughout, the, day, tilting, wheelchairs, are, commonly, used, by, people, with, cerebral, palsy, people, with, some, muscle, diseases, and, people, with, limited, range, of, motion, in, the, hip, or, knee, joints, tilting, options, are, more, common, than, reclining, options, in, wheelchairs, designed, for, use, by, children, a, standing, wheelchair, is, one, that, supports, the, user, in, a, nearly, standing, position, they, can, be, used, as, both, a, wheelchair, and, a, standing, frame, allowing, the, user, to, sit, or, stand, in, the, wheelchair, as, they, wish, some, versions, are, entirely, manual, others, have, a, powered, stand, on, an, otherwise, manual, chair, while, others, have, full, power, tilt, recline, and, variations, of, powered, stand, functions, available, the, benefits, of, such, a, device, include, but, are, not, limited, to, aiding, independence, and, productivity, raising, self, esteem, and, psychological, well, being, heightening, social, status, extending, access, relief, of, pressure, reduction, of, pressure, sores, improved, functional, reach, improved, respiration, reduced, occurrence, of, uti, improved, flexibility, help, in, maintaining, bone, mineral, density, improved, passive, range, motion, reduction, in, abnormal, muscle, tone, and, spasticity, and, skeletal, deformities, other, wheelchairs, provide, some, of, the, same, benefits, by, raising, the, entire, seat, to, lift, the, user, to, standing, height, a, range, of, disabled, sports, have, been, developed, for, disabled, athletes, including, basketball, rugby, tennis, racing, and, dancing, the, wheelchairs, used, for, each, sport, have, evolved, to, suit, the, specific, needs, of, that, sport, and, often, no, longer, resemble, their, everyday, cousins, they, are, usually, non, folding, in, order, to, increase, rigidity, with, a, pronounced, negative, camber, for, the, wheels, which, provides, stability, and, is, helpful, for, making, sharp, turns, and, often, are, made, of, composite, lightweight, materials, even, seating, positions, may, be, radically, different, with, racing, wheelchairs, generally, used, in, a, kneeling, position, sport, wheelchairs, are, rarely, suited, for, everyday, use, and, are, often, a, second, chair, specifically, for, sports, use, although, some, users, prefer, the, sports, options, for, everyday, use, some, disabled, people, specifically, lower, limb, amputees, may, use, a, wheelchair, for, sports, but, not, for, everyday, activities, while, most, wheelchair, sports, use, manual, chairs, some, power, chair, sports, such, as, powerchair, football, exist, hockey, can, also, be, played, from, electrical, wheelchairs, wheelchair, stretchers, are, a, variant, of, wheeled, stretchers, gurneys, that, can, accommodate, a, sitting, patient, or, be, adjusted, to, lie, flat, to, help, in, the, lateral, or, supine, transfer, of, a, patient, from, a, bed, to, the, chair, or, back, once, transferred, the, stretcher, can, be, adjusted, to, allow, the, patient, to, assume, a, sitting, position, all, terrain, wheelchairs, can, allow, users, to, access, terrain, otherwise, completely, inaccessible, to, a, wheelchair, user, two, different, formats, have, been, developed, one, hybridises, wheelchair, and, mountain, bike, technology, generally, taking, the, form, of, a, frame, within, which, the, user, sits, and, with, four, mountain, bike, wheels, at, the, corners, in, general, there, are, no, push, rims, and, propulsion, braking, is, by, pushing, directly, on, the, tyres, a, more, common, variant, is, the, beach, wheelchair, beach, going, wheelchair, which, can, allow, better, mobility, on, beach, sand, including, in, the, water, on, uneven, terrain, and, even, on, snow, the, common, adaptation, among, the, different, designs, is, that, they, have, extra, wide, balloon, wheels, or, tires, to, increase, stability, and, decrease, ground, pressure, on, uneven, or, unsteady, terrain, different, models, are, available, both, manual, and, battery, driven, in, some, countries, in, europe, where, accessible, tourism, is, well, established, many, beaches, have, wheelchairs, of, this, type, available, for, loan, hire, a, smart, wheelchair, is, any, powerchair, using, a, control, system, to, augment, or, replace, user, control, its, purpose, is, to, reduce, or, eliminate, the, user, s, task, of, driving, a, powerchair, usually, a, smart, wheelchair, is, controlled, via, a, computer, has, a, suite, of, sensors, and, applies, techniques, in, mobile, robotics, but, this, is, not, necessary, the, type, of, sensors, most, frequently, used, by, smart, wheelchairs, are, the, ultrasonic, acoustic, range, finder, i, e, sonar, and, infrared, red, ir, range, finder, the, interface, may, consist, of, a, conventional, wheelchair, joystick, a, sip, and, puff, device, or, a, touch, sensitive, display, this, differs, from, a, conventional, powerchair, in, which, the, user, exerts, manual, control, over, speed, and, direction, without, intervention, by, the, wheelchair, s, control, system, smart, wheelchairs, are, designed, for, a, variety, of, user, types, some, are, designed, for, users, with, cognitive, impairments, such, as, dementia, these, typically, apply, collision, avoidance, techniques, to, ensure, that, users, do, not, accidentally, select, a, drive, command, that, results, in, a, collision, others, focus, on, users, living, with, severe, motor, disabilities, such, as, cerebral, palsy, or, with, quadriplegia, and, the, role, of, the, smart, wheelchair, is, to, interpret, small, muscular, activations, as, high, level, commands, and, execute, them, such, wheelchairs, typically, employ, techniques, from, artificial, intelligence, such, as, path, planning, recent, technological, advances, are, slowly, improving, wheelchair, and, powerchair, technology, a, variation, on, the, manually, propelled, wheelchair, is, the, leveraged, freedom, chair, lfc, designed, by, the, mit, mobility, lab, this, wheelchair, is, designed, to, be, low, cost, constructed, with, local, materials, for, users, in, developing, countries, engineering, modifications, have, added, hand, controlled, levers, to, the, lfc, to, enable, users, to, move, the, chair, over, uneven, ground, and, minor, obstacles, such, as, bumpy, dirt, roads, that, are, common, in, developing, countries, it, is, under, development, and, has, been, tested, in, kenya, and, india, so, far, the, addition, of, geared, all, mechanical, wheels, for, manual, wheelchairs, is, a, new, development, incorporating, a, hypocycloidal, reduction, gear, into, the, wheel, design, the, 2, gear, wheels, can, be, added, to, a, manual, wheelchair, the, geared, wheels, provide, a, user, with, additional, assistance, by, providing, leverage, through, gearing, like, a, bicycle, not, a, motor, the, two, gear, wheels, offer, two, speed, ratios, 1, 1, no, help, no, extra, torque, and, 2, 1, providing, 100, more, hill, climbing, force, the, low, gear, incorporates, an, automatic, hill, hold, function, which, holds, the, wheelchair, in, place, on, a, hill, between, pushes, but, will, allow, the, user, to, override, the, hill, hold, to, roll, the, wheels, backward, if, needed, the, low, gear, also, provides, downhill, control, when, descending, a, recent, development, related, to, wheelchairs, is, the, handcycle, they, come, in, a, variety, of, forms, from, the, road, and, track, racing, models, to, off, road, types, modelled, after, mountain, bikes, while, dedicated, handcycle, designs, are, manufactured, clip, on, versions, are, available, that, can, convert, a, manual, wheelchair, to, a, handcycle, in, seconds, the, general, concept, is, a, clip, on, front, fork, with, hand, pedals, usually, attaching, to, a, mounting, on, the, footplate, a, somewhat, related, concept, is, the, freewheel, a, large, dolley, wheel, attaching, to, the, front, of, a, manual, wheelchair, again, generally, to, the, footplate, mounting, which, improves, wheelchair, performance, over, rough, terrain, unlike, a, handcycle, a, wheelchair, with, a, freewheel, continues, to, be, propelled, via, the, rear, wheels, there, are, several, types, of, hybrid, powered, handcycles, where, hand, pedals, and, used, along, with, the, electrical, motor, that, helps, on, hills, and, large, distances, the, most, recent, generation, of, clip, on, handcycles, is, fully, electrical, wheelchair, power, add, ons, that, use, lithium, ion, battery, brushless, dc, electric, motor, and, light, weight, aluminium, frames, with, easy, to, attach, clamps, to, convert, almost, any, manual, wheelchair, into, electrical, trike, in, seconds, that, makes, long, distance, journeys, and, everyday, tasks, much, easier, and, keeps, wheelchair, users, hands, clean, there, have, been, significant, efforts, over, the, past, 20, years, to, develop, stationary, wheelchair, trainer, platforms, that, could, enable, wheelchair, users, to, exercise, as, one, would, on, a, treadmill, or, bicycle, trainer, some, devices, have, been, created, that, could, be, used, in, conjunction, with, virtual, travel, and, interactive, gaming, similar, to, an, omnidirectional, treadmill, this, convergence, of, virtual, reality, and, a, treadmill, have, been, used, for, pediatric, and, adult, rehabilitation, to, regain, walking, skills, in, 2011, british, inventor, andrew, slorance, developed, carbon, black, the, first, wheelchair, to, be, made, almost, entirely, out, of, carbon, fibre, recently, epfl, s, cnbi, project, has, succeeded, in, making, wheelchairs, that, can, be, controlled, by, brain, impulses, interest, in, electric, powered, wheelchairs, that, are, able, to, climb, stairs, has, increased, over, the, past, twenty, years, therefore, many, electric, wheelchairs, with, the, ability, to, climb, stairs, have, been, developed, electric, powered, wheelchairs, with, climbing, ability, need, to, be, stronger, and, have, greater, movement, in, comparison, to, an, electric, powered, wheelchair, that, cannot, climb, stairs, they, must, also, be, stable, in, order, to, prevent, injury, to, the, wheelchair, user, there, are, currently, a, number, of, electric, powered, wheelchairs, that, are, able, to, climb, stairs, available, to, purchase, technical, developments, are, continuing, in, this, area, experiments, have, also, been, made, with, unusual, variant, wheels, like, the, omniwheel, or, the, mecanum, wheel, these, allow, for, a, broader, spectrum, of, movement, but, have, made, no, mass, market, penetration, the, electric, wheelchair, shown, on, the, right, is, fitted, with, mecanum, wheels, sometimes, known, as, ilon, wheels, which, give, it, complete, freedom, of, movement, it, can, be, driven, forwards, backward, sideways, and, diagonally, and, also, turned, around, on, the, spot, or, turned, around, while, moving, all, operated, from, a, simple, joystick, adapting, the, built, environment, to, make, it, more, accessible, to, wheelchair, users, is, one, of, the, key, campaigns, of, disability, rights, movements, and, local, equality, legislation, such, the, americans, with, disabilities, act, of, 1990, ada, the, social, model, of, disability, defines, disability, as, the, discrimination, experienced, by, people, with, impairments, as, a, result, of, the, failure, of, society, to, provide, the, adaptions, needed, for, them, to, participate, in, society, as, equals, this, includes, both, physical, adaptions, of, the, built, environment, and, adaption, of, organizational, and, social, structures, and, attitudes, a, core, principle, of, access, is, universal, design, that, all, people, regardless, of, disability, are, entitled, to, equal, access, to, all, parts, of, society, like, public, transportation, and, buildings, a, wheelchair, user, is, less, disabled, in, an, environment, without, stairs, access, starts, outside, of, the, building, with, the, provision, of, reduced, height, kerb, cuts, where, wheelchair, users, may, need, to, cross, roads, and, the, provision, of, adequate, wheelchair, parking, which, must, provide, extra, space, in, order, to, allow, wheelchair, users, to, transfer, directly, from, seat, to, chair, some, tension, exists, between, access, provisions, for, visually, impaired, pedestrians, and, wheelchair, users, and, other, mobility, impaired, pedestrians, as, textured, paving, vital, for, visually, impaired, people, to, recognise, the, edge, of, features, such, as, light, controlled, crossings, is, uncomfortable, at, best, and, dangerous, at, worst, to, those, with, mobility, impairments, for, access, to, public, buildings, it, is, frequently, necessary, to, adapt, older, buildings, with, features, such, as, ramps, or, elevators, in, order, to, allow, access, by, wheelchair, users, and, other, people, with, mobility, impairments, other, important, adaptations, can, include, powered, doors, lowered, fixtures, such, as, sinks, and, water, fountains, and, accessible, toilets, with, adequate, space, and, grab, bars, to, allow, the, disabled, person, to, transfer, out, of, their, wheelchair, onto, the, fixture, access, needs, for, people, with, other, disabilities, for, instance, visual, impairments, may, also, be, required, such, as, by, provision, of, high, visibility, markings, on, the, edges, of, steps, and, braille, labelling, increasingly, new, construction, for, public, use, is, required, by, local, equality, laws, to, have, these, features, incorporated, at, the, design, stage, the, same, principles, of, access, that, apply, to, public, buildings, also, apply, to, private, homes, and, may, be, required, as, part, of, local, building, regulations, important, adaptations, include, external, access, providing, sufficient, space, for, a, wheelchair, user, to, move, around, the, home, doorways, that, are, wide, enough, for, convenient, use, access, to, upper, floors, where, they, exist, which, can, be, provided, either, by, dedicated, wheelchair, lifts, or, in, some, cases, by, using, a, stairlift, to, transfer, between, wheelchairs, on, different, floors, and, by, providing, accessible, bathrooms, with, showers, and, or, bathtubs, that, are, designed, for, accessibility, accessible, bathrooms, can, permit, the, use, of, mobile, shower, chairs, or, transfer, benches, to, facilitate, bathing, for, people, with, disabilities, wet, rooms, are, bathrooms, where, the, shower, floor, and, bathroom, floor, are, one, continuous, waterproof, surface, such, floor, designs, allow, a, wheelchair, user, using, a, dedicated, shower, chair, or, transferring, onto, a, shower, seat, to, enter, the, shower, without, needing, to, overcome, a, barrier, or, lip, the, construction, of, low, floor, trams, and, buses, are, increasingly, required, by, law, whereas, the, use, of, inaccessible, features, such, as, paternoster, lifts, in, public, buildings, without, any, alternative, methods, of, wheelchair, access, is, increasingly, deprecated, modern, architecture, is, increasingly, required, by, law, and, recognised, good, practise, to, incorporate, better, accessibility, at, the, design, stage, in, many, countries, such, as, the, uk, the, owners, of, inaccessible, buildings, who, have, not, provided, permanent, access, measures, are, still, required, by, local, equality, legislation, to, provide, reasonable, adjustments, to, ensure, that, disabled, people, are, able, to, access, their, services, and, are, not, excluded, these, may, range, from, keeping, a, portable, ramp, on, hand, to, allow, a, wheelchair, user, to, cross, an, inaccessible, threshold, to, providing, personal, service, to, access, goods, they, are, not, otherwise, able, to, reach, public, transit, vehicles, are, increasingly, required, to, be, accessible, to, people, who, use, wheelchairs, in, the, united, states, a, wheelchair, that, has, been, designed, and, tested, for, use, as, a, seat, in, motor, vehicles, is, often, referred, to, as, a, wc19, wheelchair, or, a, transit, wheelchair, ansi, resna, wc19, officially, section, 19, ansi, resna, wc, vol, 1, wheelchairs, for, use, in, motor, vehicles, is, a, voluntary, standard, for, wheelchairs, designed, for, use, when, traveling, facing, forward, in, a, motor, vehicle, iso, 7176, 19, is, an, international, transit, wheelchair, standard, that, specifies, similar, design, and, performance, requirements, as, ansi, resna, wc19, there, are, special, vans, equipped, for, wheelchairs, these, vans, are, large, and, have, a, ramp, on, a, side, door, or, the, back, door, so, a, wheelchair, can, get, inside, the, vehicle, while, the, user, is, still, in, it, some, of, the, back, seats, will, be, removed, and, replaced, with, wheelchair, security, harnesses, sometimes, wheelchair, vans, are, equipped, so, the, wheelchair, user, can, drive, the, van, without, getting, out, of, the, wheelchair, a, vehicle, can, be, equipped, with, hand, controls, hand, controls, are, used, when, a, person, can, not, move, their, legs, to, push, the, pedals, the, hand, controls, do, the, pushing, of, the, pedals, some, racecar, drivers, are, paralyzed, and, use, hand, controls, some, elements, of, the, outdoor, public, realm, present, barriers, to, wheelchair, use, such, as, grade, separated, areas, where, no, ramps, are, provided, uk, guidance, recommends, a, minimum, width, of, 1, 5m, for, a, wheelchair, user, and, an, ambulant, pedestrian, to, move, side, by, side, with, maximum, ramp, gradients, of, 8, for, manual, wheelchair, use, 5, is, preferred, several, organizations, exist, that, help, to, give, and, receive, wheelchair, equipment, organizations, that, accept, wheelchair, equipment, donations, typically, attempt, to, identify, recipients, and, match, them, with, the, donated, equipment, they, have, received, organizations, that, accept, donations, in, the, form, of, money, for, wheelchairs, typically, have, the, wheelchairs, manufactured, and, distributed, in, large, numbers, often, in, developing, countries, organizations, focusing, on, wheelchairs, include, direct, relief, the, free, wheelchair, mission, hope, haven, personal, energy, transportation, the, wheelchair, foundation, and, wheelpower, in, the, united, kingdom, wheelchairs, are, supplied, and, maintained, free, of, charge, for, non, ambulatory, disabled, people, wheelchair, seating, systems, are, designed, both, to, support, the, user, in, the, sitting, position, and, to, redistribute, pressure, from, areas, of, the, body, that, are, at, risk, of, pressure, ulcers, for, someone, in, the, sitting, position, the, parts, of, the, body, that, are, the, most, at, risk, for, tissue, breakdown, include, the, ischial, tuberosities, coccyx, sacrum, and, greater, trochanters, wheelchair, cushions, are, the, prime, method, of, delivering, this, protection, and, are, nearly, universally, used, wheelchair, cushions, are, also, used, to, provide, stability, comfort, aid, posture, and, absorb, shock, wheelchair, cushions, range, from, simple, blocks, of, foam, costing, a, few, pounds, or, dollars, to, specifically, engineered, multilayer, designs, with, costs, running, into, the, hundreds, of, pounds, dollars, euros, prior, to, 1970, little, was, known, about, the, effectiveness, of, wheelchair, cushions, and, there, was, not, a, clinical, method, of, evaluating, wheelchair, seat, cushions, most, recently, pressure, imaging, or, pressure, mapping, is, used, to, help, determine, each, individual, s, pressure, distribution, to, properly, determine, and, fit, a, seating, system, while, almost, all, wheelchair, users, will, use, a, wheelchair, cushion, some, users, need, more, extensive, postural, support, this, can, be, provided, by, adaptions, to, the, back, of, the, wheelchair, which, can, provide, increased, rigidity, head, neck, rests, and, lateral, support, and, in, some, cases, by, adaptions, to, the, seat, such, as, pommels, and, knee, blocks, harnesses, may, also, be, required, there, is, a, wide, range, of, accessories, for, wheelchairs, there, are, cushions, cup, holders, seatbelts, storage, bags, lights, and, more, a, wheelchair, user, uses, seatbelts, for, security, or, posture, some, wheelchair, users, want, to, use, a, seatbelt, to, make, sure, they, never, fall, out, of, the, wheelchair, other, wheelchair, users, use, a, seatbelt, because, they, can, not, sit, up, straight, on, their, own
