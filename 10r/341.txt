the, diesel, engine, named, after, the, german, engineer, rudolf, diesel, is, an, internal, combustion, engine, in, which, ignition, of, the, fuel, is, caused, by, the, elevated, temperature, of, the, air, in, the, cylinder, due, to, mechanical, compression, thus, the, diesel, engine, is, called, a, compression, ignition, engine, ci, engine, this, contrasts, with, engines, using, spark, plug, ignition, of, the, air, fuel, mixture, such, as, a, petrol, engine, gasoline, engine, or, a, gas, engine, using, a, gaseous, fuel, like, natural, gas, or, liquefied, petroleum, gas, diesel, engines, work, by, compressing, only, air, or, air, combined, with, residual, combustion, gases, from, the, exhaust, known, as, exhaust, gas, recirculation, egr, air, is, inducted, into, the, chamber, during, the, intake, stroke, and, compressed, during, the, compression, stroke, this, increases, air, temperature, inside, the, cylinder, so, that, atomised, diesel, fuel, injected, into, the, combustion, chamber, ignites, with, the, fuel, being, injected, into, the, air, just, before, combustion, the, dispersion, of, fuel, is, uneven, this, is, called, a, heterogeneous, air, fuel, mixture, the, torque, a, diesel, engine, produces, is, controlled, by, manipulating, the, air, fuel, ratio, instead, of, throttling, the, intake, air, the, diesel, engine, relies, on, altering, the, amount, of, fuel, that, is, injected, and, thus, the, air, fuel, ratio, is, usually, high, the, diesel, engine, has, the, highest, thermal, efficiency, see, engine, efficiency, of, any, practical, internal, or, external, combustion, engine, due, to, its, very, high, expansion, ratio, and, inherent, lean, burn, which, enables, heat, dissipation, by, excess, air, a, small, efficiency, loss, is, also, avoided, compared, with, non, direct, injection, gasoline, engines, as, unburned, fuel, is, not, present, during, valve, overlap, and, therefore, no, fuel, goes, directly, from, the, intake, injection, to, the, exhaust, low, speed, diesel, engines, as, used, in, ships, and, other, applications, where, overall, engine, weight, is, relatively, unimportant, can, reach, effective, efficiencies, of, up, to, 55, the, combined, cycle, gas, turbine, brayton, and, rankine, cycle, is, a, combustion, engine, that, is, more, efficient, than, a, diesel, engine, but, due, to, its, mass, and, dimensions, is, unsuitable, for, many, vehicles, including, watercraft, and, some, aircraft, the, world, s, largest, diesel, engines, put, in, service, are, 14, cylinder, two, stroke, marine, diesel, engines, they, produce, a, peak, power, of, almost, 100, mw, each, diesel, engines, may, be, designed, with, either, two, stroke, or, four, stroke, combustion, cycles, they, were, originally, used, as, a, more, efficient, replacement, for, stationary, steam, engines, since, the, 1910s, they, have, been, used, in, submarines, and, ships, use, in, locomotives, buses, trucks, heavy, equipment, agricultural, equipment, and, electricity, generation, plants, followed, later, in, the, 1930s, they, slowly, began, to, be, used, in, some, automobiles, since, the, 1970s, energy, crisis, demand, for, higher, fuel, efficiency, has, resulted, in, most, major, automakers, at, some, point, offering, diesel, powered, models, even, in, very, small, cars, according, to, konrad, reif, 2012, the, eu, average, for, diesel, cars, at, the, time, accounted, for, half, of, newly, registered, cars, however, air, pollution, and, overall, emissions, are, more, difficult, to, control, in, diesel, engines, compared, to, gasoline, engines, and, the, use, of, diesel, auto, engines, in, the, u, s, is, now, largely, relegated, to, larger, on, road, and, off, road, vehicles, though, aviation, has, traditionally, avoided, using, diesel, engines, aircraft, diesel, engines, have, become, increasingly, available, in, the, 21st, century, since, the, late, 1990s, for, various, reasons, including, the, diesel, s, inherent, advantages, over, gasoline, engines, but, also, for, recent, issues, peculiar, to, aviation, development, and, production, of, diesel, engines, for, aircraft, has, surged, with, over, 5, 000, such, engines, delivered, worldwide, between, 2002, and, 2018, particularly, for, light, airplanes, and, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, in, 1878, rudolf, diesel, who, was, a, student, at, the, polytechnikum, in, munich, attended, the, lectures, of, carl, von, linde, linde, explained, that, steam, engines, are, capable, of, converting, just, 6, 10, of, the, heat, energy, into, work, but, that, the, carnot, cycle, allows, conversion, of, much, more, of, the, heat, energy, into, work, by, means, of, isothermal, change, in, condition, according, to, diesel, this, ignited, the, idea, of, creating, a, highly, efficient, engine, that, could, work, on, the, carnot, cycle, diesel, was, also, introduced, to, a, fire, piston, a, traditional, fire, starter, using, rapid, adiabatic, compression, principles, which, linde, had, acquired, from, southeast, asia, after, several, years, of, working, on, his, ideas, diesel, published, them, in, 1893, in, the, essay, theory, and, construction, of, a, rational, heat, motor, diesel, was, heavily, criticised, for, his, essay, but, only, a, few, found, the, mistake, that, he, made, his, rational, heat, motor, was, supposed, to, utilise, a, constant, temperature, cycle, with, isothermal, compression, that, would, require, a, much, higher, level, of, compression, than, that, needed, for, compression, ignition, diesel, s, idea, was, to, compress, the, air, so, tightly, that, the, temperature, of, the, air, would, exceed, that, of, combustion, however, such, an, engine, could, never, perform, any, usable, work, in, his, 1892, us, patent, granted, in, 1895, 542846, diesel, describes, the, compression, required, for, his, cycle, by, june, 1893, diesel, had, realised, his, original, cycle, would, not, work, and, he, adopted, the, constant, pressure, cycle, diesel, describes, the, cycle, in, his, 1895, patent, application, notice, that, there, is, no, longer, a, mention, of, compression, temperatures, exceeding, the, temperature, of, combustion, now, it, is, simply, stated, that, the, compression, must, be, sufficient, to, trigger, ignition, in, 1892, diesel, received, patents, in, germany, switzerland, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, for, method, of, and, apparatus, for, converting, heat, into, work, in, 1894, and, 1895, he, filed, patents, and, addenda, in, various, countries, for, his, engine, the, first, patents, were, issued, in, spain, no, 16, 654, france, no, 243, 531, and, belgium, no, 113, 139, in, december, 1894, and, in, germany, no, 86, 633, in, 1895, and, the, united, states, no, 608, 845, in, 1898, diesel, was, attacked, and, criticised, over, several, years, critics, claimed, that, diesel, never, invented, a, new, motor, and, that, the, invention, of, the, diesel, engine, is, fraud, otto, k, hler, and, emil, capitaine, were, two, of, the, most, prominent, critics, of, diesel, s, time, k, hler, had, published, an, essay, in, 1887, in, which, he, describes, an, engine, similar, to, the, engine, diesel, describes, in, his, 1893, essay, k, hler, figured, that, such, an, engine, could, not, perform, any, work, emil, capitaine, had, built, a, petroleum, engine, with, glow, tube, ignition, in, the, early, 1890s, he, claimed, against, his, own, better, judgement, that, his, glow, tube, ignition, engine, worked, the, same, way, diesel, s, engine, did, his, claims, were, unfounded, and, he, lost, a, patent, lawsuit, against, diesel, other, engines, such, as, the, akroyd, engine, and, the, brayton, engine, also, use, an, operating, cycle, that, is, different, from, the, diesel, engine, cycle, friedrich, sass, says, that, the, diesel, engine, is, diesel, s, very, own, work, and, that, any, diesel, myth, is, falsification, of, history, diesel, sought, out, firms, and, factories, that, would, build, his, engine, with, the, help, of, moritz, schr, ter, and, max, gutermuth, he, succeeded, in, convincing, both, krupp, in, essen, and, the, maschinenfabrik, augsburg, contracts, were, signed, in, april, 1893, and, in, early, summer, 1893, diesel, s, first, prototype, engine, was, built, in, augsburg, on, 10, august, 1893, the, first, ignition, took, place, the, fuel, used, was, petrol, in, winter, 1893, 1894, diesel, redesigned, the, existing, engine, and, by, 18, january, 1894, his, mechanics, had, converted, it, into, the, second, prototype, during, january, that, year, an, air, blast, injection, system, was, added, to, the, engine, s, cylinder, head, and, tested, friedrich, sass, argues, that, it, can, be, presumed, that, diesel, copied, the, concept, of, air, blast, injection, from, george, b, brayton, albeit, that, diesel, substantially, improved, the, system, on, 17, february, 1894, the, redesigned, engine, ran, for, 88, revolutions, one, minute, with, this, news, maschinenfabrik, augsburg, s, stock, rose, by, 30, indicative, of, the, tremendous, anticipated, demands, for, a, more, efficient, engine, on, 26, june, 1895, the, engine, achieved, an, effective, efficiency, of, 16, 6, and, had, a, fuel, consumption, of, 519, g, kw, 1, h, 1, however, despite, proving, the, concept, the, engine, caused, problems, and, diesel, could, not, achieve, any, substantial, progress, therefore, krupp, considered, rescinding, the, contract, they, had, made, with, diesel, diesel, was, forced, to, improve, the, design, of, his, engine, and, rushed, to, construct, a, third, prototype, engine, between, 8, november, and, 20, december, 1895, the, second, prototype, had, successfully, covered, over, 111, hours, on, the, test, bench, in, the, january, 1896, report, this, was, considered, a, success, in, february, 1896, diesel, considered, supercharging, the, third, prototype, imanuel, lauster, who, was, ordered, to, draw, the, third, prototype, motor, 250, 400, had, finished, the, drawings, by, 30, april, 1896, during, summer, that, year, the, engine, was, built, it, was, completed, on, 6, october, 1896, tests, were, conducted, until, early, 1897, first, public, tests, began, on, 1, february, 1897, moritz, schr, ter, s, test, on, 17, february, 1897, was, the, main, test, of, diesel, s, engine, the, engine, was, rated, 13, 1, kw, with, a, specific, fuel, consumption, of, 324, g, kw, 1, h, 1, resulting, in, an, effective, efficiency, of, 26, 2, by, 1898, diesel, had, become, a, millionaire, the, characteristics, of, a, diesel, engine, are, the, diesel, internal, combustion, engine, differs, from, the, gasoline, powered, otto, cycle, by, using, highly, compressed, hot, air, to, ignite, the, fuel, rather, than, using, a, spark, plug, compression, ignition, rather, than, spark, ignition, in, the, diesel, engine, only, air, is, initially, introduced, into, the, combustion, chamber, the, air, is, then, compressed, with, a, compression, ratio, typically, between, 15, 1, and, 23, 1, this, high, compression, causes, the, temperature, of, the, air, to, rise, at, about, the, top, of, the, compression, stroke, fuel, is, injected, directly, into, the, compressed, air, in, the, combustion, chamber, this, may, be, into, a, typically, toroidal, void, in, the, top, of, the, piston, or, a, pre, chamber, depending, upon, the, design, of, the, engine, the, fuel, injector, ensures, that, the, fuel, is, broken, down, into, small, droplets, and, that, the, fuel, is, distributed, evenly, the, heat, of, the, compressed, air, vaporises, fuel, from, the, surface, of, the, droplets, the, vapour, is, then, ignited, by, the, heat, from, the, compressed, air, in, the, combustion, chamber, the, droplets, continue, to, vaporise, from, their, surfaces, and, burn, getting, smaller, until, all, the, fuel, in, the, droplets, has, been, burnt, combustion, occurs, at, a, substantially, constant, pressure, during, the, initial, part, of, the, power, stroke, the, start, of, vaporisation, causes, a, delay, before, ignition, and, the, characteristic, diesel, knocking, sound, as, the, vapour, reaches, ignition, temperature, and, causes, an, abrupt, increase, in, pressure, above, the, piston, not, shown, on, the, p, v, indicator, diagram, when, combustion, is, complete, the, combustion, gases, expand, as, the, piston, descends, further, the, high, pressure, in, the, cylinder, drives, the, piston, downward, supplying, power, to, the, crankshaft, as, well, as, the, high, level, of, compression, allowing, combustion, to, take, place, without, a, separate, ignition, system, a, high, compression, ratio, greatly, increases, the, engine, s, efficiency, increasing, the, compression, ratio, in, a, spark, ignition, engine, where, fuel, and, air, are, mixed, before, entry, to, the, cylinder, is, limited, by, the, need, to, prevent, pre, ignition, which, would, cause, engine, damage, since, only, air, is, compressed, in, a, diesel, engine, and, fuel, is, not, introduced, into, the, cylinder, until, shortly, before, top, dead, centre, tdc, premature, detonation, is, not, a, problem, and, compression, ratios, are, much, higher, the, pressure, volume, diagram, pv, diagram, is, a, simplified, and, idealised, representation, of, the, events, involved, in, a, diesel, engine, cycle, arranged, to, illustrate, the, similarity, with, a, carnot, cycle, starting, at, 1, the, piston, is, at, bottom, dead, centre, and, both, valves, are, closed, at, the, start, of, the, compression, stroke, the, cylinder, contains, air, at, atmospheric, pressure, between, 1, and, 2, the, air, is, compressed, adiabatically, that, is, without, heat, transfer, to, or, from, the, environment, by, the, rising, piston, this, is, only, approximately, true, since, there, will, be, some, heat, exchange, with, the, cylinder, walls, during, this, compression, the, volume, is, reduced, the, pressure, and, temperature, both, rise, at, or, slightly, before, 2, tdc, fuel, is, injected, and, burns, in, the, compressed, hot, air, chemical, energy, is, released, and, this, constitutes, an, injection, of, thermal, energy, heat, into, the, compressed, gas, combustion, and, heating, occur, between, 2, and, 3, in, this, interval, the, pressure, remains, constant, since, the, piston, descends, and, the, volume, increases, the, temperature, rises, as, a, consequence, of, the, energy, of, combustion, at, 3, fuel, injection, and, combustion, are, complete, and, the, cylinder, contains, gas, at, a, higher, temperature, than, at, 2, between, 3, and, 4, this, hot, gas, expands, again, approximately, adiabatically, work, is, done, on, the, system, to, which, the, engine, is, connected, during, this, expansion, phase, the, volume, of, the, gas, rises, and, its, temperature, and, pressure, both, fall, at, 4, the, exhaust, valve, opens, and, the, pressure, falls, abruptly, to, atmospheric, approximately, this, is, unresisted, expansion, and, no, useful, work, is, done, by, it, ideally, the, adiabatic, expansion, should, continue, extending, the, line, 3, 4, to, the, right, until, the, pressure, falls, to, that, of, the, surrounding, air, but, the, loss, of, efficiency, caused, by, this, unresisted, expansion, is, justified, by, the, practical, difficulties, involved, in, recovering, it, the, engine, would, have, to, be, much, larger, after, the, opening, of, the, exhaust, valve, the, exhaust, stroke, follows, but, this, and, the, following, induction, stroke, are, not, shown, on, the, diagram, if, shown, they, would, be, represented, by, a, low, pressure, loop, at, the, bottom, of, the, diagram, at, 1, it, is, assumed, that, the, exhaust, and, induction, strokes, have, been, completed, and, the, cylinder, is, again, filled, with, air, the, piston, cylinder, system, absorbs, energy, between, 1, and, 2, this, is, the, work, needed, to, compress, the, air, in, the, cylinder, and, is, provided, by, mechanical, kinetic, energy, stored, in, the, flywheel, of, the, engine, work, output, is, done, by, the, piston, cylinder, combination, between, 2, and, 4, the, difference, between, these, two, increments, of, work, is, the, indicated, work, output, per, cycle, and, is, represented, by, the, area, enclosed, by, the, pv, loop, the, adiabatic, expansion, is, in, a, higher, pressure, range, than, that, of, the, compression, because, the, gas, in, the, cylinder, is, hotter, during, expansion, than, during, compression, it, is, for, this, reason, that, the, loop, has, a, finite, area, and, the, net, output, of, work, during, a, cycle, is, positive, the, fuel, efficiency, of, diesel, engines, is, better, than, most, other, types, of, combustion, engines, due, to, their, high, compression, ratio, high, air, fuel, equivalence, ratio, and, the, lack, of, intake, air, restrictions, i, e, throttle, valves, theoretically, the, highest, possible, efficiency, for, a, diesel, engine, is, 75, however, in, practice, the, efficiency, is, much, lower, with, efficiencies, of, up, to, 43, for, passenger, car, engines, up, to, 45, for, large, truck, and, bus, engines, and, up, to, 55, for, large, two, stroke, marine, engines, the, average, efficiency, over, a, motor, vehicle, driving, cycle, is, lower, than, the, diesel, engine, s, peak, efficiency, for, example, a, 37, average, efficiency, for, an, engine, with, a, peak, efficiency, of, 44, that, is, because, the, fuel, efficiency, of, a, diesel, engine, drops, at, lower, loads, however, it, does, not, drop, quite, as, fast, as, the, otto, spark, ignition, engine, s, diesel, engines, are, combustion, engines, and, therefore, emit, combustion, products, in, their, exhaust, gas, due, to, incomplete, combustion, diesel, engine, exhaust, gases, include, carbon, monoxide, hydrocarbons, particulate, matter, and, nitrogen, oxides, pollutants, about, 90, per, cent, of, the, pollutants, can, be, removed, from, the, exhaust, gas, using, exhaust, gas, treatment, technology, road, vehicle, diesel, engines, have, no, sulfur, dioxide, emissions, because, motor, vehicle, diesel, fuel, has, been, sulfur, free, since, 2003, helmut, tsch, ke, argues, that, particulate, matter, emitted, from, motor, vehicles, has, negative, impacts, on, human, health, the, particulate, matter, in, diesel, exhaust, emissions, is, sometimes, classified, as, a, carcinogen, or, probable, carcinogen, and, is, known, to, increase, the, risk, of, heart, and, respiratory, diseases, in, principle, a, diesel, engine, does, not, require, any, sort, of, electrical, system, however, most, modern, diesel, engines, are, equipped, with, an, electrical, fuel, pump, and, an, electronic, engine, control, unit, however, there, is, no, high, voltage, electrical, ignition, system, present, in, a, diesel, engine, this, eliminates, a, source, of, radio, frequency, emissions, which, can, interfere, with, navigation, and, communication, equipment, which, is, why, only, diesel, powered, vehicles, are, allowed, in, some, parts, of, the, american, national, radio, quiet, zone, to, control, the, torque, output, at, any, given, time, i, e, when, the, driver, of, a, car, adjusts, the, accelerator, pedal, a, governor, adjusts, the, amount, of, fuel, injected, into, the, engine, mechanical, governors, have, been, used, in, the, past, however, electronic, governors, are, more, common, on, modern, engines, mechanical, governors, are, usually, driven, by, the, engine, s, accessory, belt, or, a, gear, drive, system, and, use, a, combination, of, springs, and, weights, to, control, fuel, delivery, relative, to, both, load, and, speed, electronically, governed, engines, use, an, electronic, control, unit, ecu, or, electronic, control, module, ecm, to, control, the, fuel, delivery, the, ecm, ecu, uses, various, sensors, such, as, engine, speed, signal, intake, manifold, pressure, and, fuel, temperature, to, determine, the, amount, of, fuel, injected, into, the, engine, due, to, the, amount, of, air, being, constant, for, a, given, rpm, while, the, amount, of, fuel, varies, very, high, lean, air, fuel, ratios, are, used, in, situations, where, minimal, torque, output, is, required, this, differs, from, a, petrol, engine, where, a, throttle, is, used, to, also, reduce, the, amount, of, intake, air, as, part, of, regulating, the, engine, s, torque, output, controlling, the, timing, of, the, start, of, injection, of, fuel, into, the, cylinder, is, similar, to, controlling, the, ignition, timing, in, a, petrol, engine, it, is, therefore, a, key, factor, in, controlling, the, power, output, fuel, consumption, and, exhaust, emissions, there, are, several, different, ways, of, categorising, diesel, engines, as, outlined, in, the, following, sections, g, nter, mau, categorises, diesel, engines, by, their, rotational, speeds, into, three, groups, high, speed, engines, are, used, to, power, trucks, lorries, buses, tractors, cars, yachts, compressors, pumps, and, small, electrical, generators, as, of, 2018, most, high, speed, engines, have, direct, injection, many, modern, engines, particularly, in, on, highway, applications, have, common, rail, direct, injection, on, bigger, ships, high, speed, diesel, engines, are, often, used, for, powering, electric, generators, the, highest, power, output, of, high, speed, diesel, engines, is, approximately, 5, mw, medium, speed, engines, are, used, in, large, electrical, generators, railway, diesel, locomotives, ship, propulsion, and, mechanical, drive, applications, such, as, large, compressors, or, pumps, medium, speed, diesel, engines, operate, on, either, diesel, fuel, or, heavy, fuel, oil, by, direct, injection, in, the, same, manner, as, low, speed, engines, usually, they, are, four, stroke, engines, with, trunk, pistons, a, notable, exception, being, the, emd, 567, 645, and, 710, engines, which, are, all, two, stroke, the, power, output, of, medium, speed, diesel, engines, can, be, as, high, as, 21, 870, kw, with, the, effective, efficiency, being, around, 47, 48, 1982, most, larger, medium, speed, engines, are, started, with, compressed, air, direct, on, pistons, using, an, air, distributor, as, opposed, to, a, pneumatic, starting, motor, acting, on, the, flywheel, which, tends, to, be, used, for, smaller, engines, medium, speed, engines, intended, for, marine, applications, are, usually, used, to, power, ro, ro, ferries, passenger, ships, or, small, freight, ships, using, medium, speed, engines, reduces, the, cost, of, smaller, ships, and, increases, their, transport, capacity, in, addition, to, that, a, single, ship, can, use, two, smaller, engines, instead, of, one, big, engine, which, increases, the, ship, s, safety, low, speed, diesel, engines, are, usually, very, large, in, size, and, mostly, used, to, power, ships, there, are, two, different, types, of, low, speed, engines, that, are, commonly, used, two, stroke, engines, with, a, crosshead, and, four, stroke, engines, with, a, regular, trunk, piston, two, stroke, engines, have, a, limited, rotational, frequency, and, their, charge, exchange, is, more, difficult, which, means, that, they, are, usually, bigger, than, four, stroke, engines, and, used, to, directly, power, a, ship, s, propeller, four, stroke, engines, on, ships, are, usually, used, to, power, an, electric, generator, an, electric, motor, powers, the, propeller, both, types, are, usually, very, undersquare, meaning, the, bore, is, smaller, than, the, stroke, low, speed, diesel, engines, as, used, in, ships, and, other, applications, where, overall, engine, weight, is, relatively, unimportant, often, have, an, effective, efficiency, of, up, to, 55, like, medium, speed, engines, low, speed, engines, are, started, with, compressed, air, and, they, use, heavy, oil, as, their, primary, fuel, four, stroke, engines, use, the, combustion, cycle, described, earlier, most, smaller, diesels, for, vehicular, use, for, instance, typically, use, the, four, stroke, cycle, this, is, due, to, several, factors, such, as, the, two, stroke, design, s, narrow, powerband, which, is, not, particularly, suitable, for, automotive, use, and, the, necessity, for, complicated, and, expensive, built, in, lubrication, systems, and, scavenging, measures, the, cost, effectiveness, and, proportion, of, added, weight, of, these, technologies, has, less, of, an, impact, on, larger, more, expensive, engines, while, engines, intended, for, shipping, or, stationary, use, can, be, run, at, a, single, speed, for, long, periods, two, stroke, engines, use, a, combustion, cycle, which, is, completed, in, two, strokes, instead, of, four, strokes, filling, the, cylinder, with, air, and, compressing, it, takes, place, in, one, stroke, and, the, power, and, exhaust, strokes, are, combined, the, compression, in, a, two, stroke, diesel, engine, is, similar, to, the, compression, that, takes, place, in, a, four, stroke, diesel, engine, as, the, piston, passes, through, bottom, centre, and, starts, upward, compression, commences, culminating, in, fuel, injection, and, ignition, instead, of, a, full, set, of, valves, two, stroke, diesel, engines, have, simple, intake, ports, and, exhaust, ports, or, exhaust, valves, when, the, piston, approaches, bottom, dead, centre, both, the, intake, and, the, exhaust, ports, are, open, which, means, that, there, is, atmospheric, pressure, inside, the, cylinder, therefore, some, sort, of, pump, is, required, to, blow, the, air, into, the, cylinder, and, the, combustion, gasses, into, the, exhaust, this, process, is, called, scavenging, the, pressure, required, is, approximately, 10, 30, kpa, due, to, the, lack, of, discrete, exhaust, and, intake, strokes, all, two, stroke, diesel, engines, use, a, scavenge, blower, or, some, form, of, compressor, to, charge, the, cylinders, with, air, and, assist, in, scavenging, roots, type, superchargers, were, used, for, ship, engines, until, the, mid, 1950s, however, since, 1955, they, have, been, widely, replaced, by, turbochargers, usually, a, two, stroke, ship, diesel, engine, has, a, single, stage, turbocharger, with, a, turbine, that, has, an, axial, inflow, and, a, radial, outflow, in, general, there, are, three, types, of, scavenging, possible, crossflow, scavenging, is, incomplete, and, limits, the, stroke, yet, some, manufacturers, used, it, reverse, flow, scavenging, is, a, very, simple, way, of, scavenging, and, it, was, popular, amongst, manufacturers, until, the, early, 1980s, uniflow, scavenging, is, more, complicated, to, make, but, allows, the, highest, fuel, efficiency, since, the, early, 1980s, manufacturers, such, as, man, and, sulzer, have, switched, to, this, system, it, is, standard, for, modern, marine, two, stroke, diesel, engines, so, called, dual, fuel, diesel, engines, or, gas, diesel, engines, burn, two, different, types, of, fuel, simultaneously, for, instance, a, gaseous, fuel, and, diesel, engine, fuel, the, diesel, engine, fuel, auto, ignites, due, to, compression, ignition, and, then, ignites, the, gaseous, fuel, such, engines, do, not, require, any, type, of, spark, ignition, and, operate, similar, to, regular, diesel, engines, the, fuel, is, injected, at, high, pressure, into, either, the, combustion, chamber, swirl, chamber, or, pre, chamber, unlike, petrol, engines, where, the, fuel, is, often, added, in, the, inlet, manifold, or, carburetor, engines, where, the, fuel, is, injected, into, the, main, combustion, chamber, are, called, direct, injection, di, engines, while, those, which, use, a, swirl, chamber, or, pre, chamber, are, called, indirect, injection, idi, engines, most, direct, injection, diesel, engines, have, a, combustion, cup, in, the, top, of, the, piston, where, the, fuel, is, sprayed, many, different, methods, of, injection, can, be, used, usually, an, engine, with, helix, controlled, mechanic, direct, injection, has, either, an, inline, or, a, distributor, injection, pump, for, each, engine, cylinder, the, corresponding, plunger, in, the, fuel, pump, measures, out, the, correct, amount, of, fuel, and, determines, the, timing, of, each, injection, these, engines, use, injectors, that, are, very, precise, spring, loaded, valves, that, open, and, close, at, a, specific, fuel, pressure, separate, high, pressure, fuel, lines, connect, the, fuel, pump, with, each, cylinder, fuel, volume, for, each, single, combustion, is, controlled, by, a, slanted, groove, in, the, plunger, which, rotates, only, a, few, degrees, releasing, the, pressure, and, is, controlled, by, a, mechanical, governor, consisting, of, weights, rotating, at, engine, speed, constrained, by, springs, and, a, lever, the, injectors, are, held, open, by, the, fuel, pressure, on, high, speed, engines, the, plunger, pumps, are, together, in, one, unit, the, length, of, fuel, lines, from, the, pump, to, each, injector, is, normally, the, same, for, each, cylinder, in, order, to, obtain, the, same, pressure, delay, direct, injected, diesel, engines, usually, use, orifice, type, fuel, injectors, electronic, control, of, the, fuel, injection, transformed, the, direct, injection, engine, by, allowing, much, greater, control, over, the, combustion, common, rail, cr, direct, injection, systems, do, not, have, the, fuel, metering, pressure, raising, and, delivery, functions, in, a, single, unit, as, in, the, case, of, a, bosch, distributor, type, pump, for, example, a, high, pressure, pump, supplies, the, cr, the, requirements, of, each, cylinder, injector, are, supplied, from, this, common, high, pressure, reservoir, of, fuel, an, electronic, diesel, control, edc, controls, both, rail, pressure, and, injections, depending, on, engine, operating, conditions, the, injectors, of, older, cr, systems, have, solenoid, driven, plungers, for, lifting, the, injection, needle, whilst, newer, cr, injectors, use, plungers, driven, by, piezoelectric, actuators, that, have, less, moving, mass, and, therefore, allow, even, more, injections, in, a, very, short, period, of, time, early, common, rail, system, were, controlled, by, mechanical, means, the, injection, pressure, of, modern, cr, systems, ranges, from, 140, mpa, to, 270, mpa, an, indirect, diesel, injection, system, idi, engine, delivers, fuel, into, a, small, chamber, called, a, swirl, chamber, precombustion, chamber, pre, chamber, or, ante, chamber, which, is, connected, to, the, cylinder, by, a, narrow, air, passage, generally, the, goal, of, the, pre, chamber, is, to, create, increased, turbulence, for, better, air, fuel, mixing, this, system, also, allows, for, a, smoother, quieter, running, engine, and, because, fuel, mixing, is, assisted, by, turbulence, injector, pressures, can, be, lower, most, idi, systems, use, a, single, orifice, injector, the, pre, chamber, has, the, disadvantage, of, lowering, efficiency, due, to, increased, heat, loss, to, the, engine, s, cooling, system, restricting, the, combustion, burn, thus, reducing, the, efficiency, by, 5, 10, idi, engines, are, also, more, difficult, to, start, and, usually, require, the, use, of, glow, plugs, idi, engines, may, be, cheaper, to, build, but, generally, require, a, higher, compression, ratio, than, the, di, counterpart, idi, also, makes, it, easier, to, produce, smooth, quieter, running, engines, with, a, simple, mechanical, injection, system, since, exact, injection, timing, is, not, as, critical, most, modern, automotive, engines, are, di, which, have, the, benefits, of, greater, efficiency, and, easier, starting, however, idi, engines, can, still, be, found, in, the, many, atv, and, small, diesel, applications, indirect, injected, diesel, engines, use, pintle, type, fuel, injectors, early, diesel, engines, injected, fuel, with, the, assistance, of, compressed, air, which, atomised, the, fuel, and, forced, it, into, the, engine, through, a, nozzle, a, similar, principle, to, an, aerosol, spray, the, nozzle, opening, was, closed, by, a, pin, valve, actuated, by, the, camshaft, although, the, engine, was, also, required, to, drive, an, air, compressor, used, for, air, blast, injection, the, efficiency, was, nonetheless, better, than, other, combustion, engines, of, the, time, however, the, system, was, heavy, and, it, was, slow, to, react, to, changing, torque, demands, making, it, unsuitable, for, road, vehicles, a, unit, injector, system, also, known, as, pumpe, d, se, pump, nozzle, in, german, combines, the, injector, and, fuel, pump, into, a, single, component, which, is, positioned, above, each, cylinder, this, eliminates, the, high, pressure, fuel, lines, and, achieves, a, more, consistent, injection, under, full, load, the, injection, pressure, can, reach, up, to, 220, mpa, unit, injectors, are, operated, by, a, cam, and, the, quantity, of, fuel, injected, is, controlled, either, mechanically, by, a, rack, or, lever, or, electronically, due, to, increased, performance, requirements, unit, injectors, have, been, largely, replaced, by, common, rail, injection, systems, the, average, diesel, engine, has, a, poorer, power, to, mass, ratio, than, an, equivalent, petrol, engine, the, lower, engine, speeds, rpm, of, typical, diesel, engines, results, in, a, lower, power, output, also, the, mass, of, a, diesel, engine, is, typically, higher, since, the, higher, operating, pressure, inside, the, combustion, chamber, increases, the, internal, forces, which, requires, stronger, and, therefore, heavier, parts, to, withstand, these, forces, the, distinctive, noise, of, a, diesel, engine, particularly, at, idling, speeds, is, sometimes, called, diesel, clatter, this, noise, is, largely, caused, by, the, sudden, ignition, of, the, diesel, fuel, when, injected, into, the, combustion, chamber, which, causes, a, pressure, wave, that, sounds, like, knocking, engine, designers, can, reduce, diesel, clatter, through, indirect, injection, pilot, or, pre, injection, injection, timing, injection, rate, compression, ratio, turbo, boost, and, exhaust, gas, recirculation, egr, common, rail, diesel, injection, systems, permit, multiple, injection, events, as, an, aid, to, noise, reduction, through, measures, such, as, these, diesel, clatter, noise, is, greatly, reduced, in, modern, engines, diesel, fuels, with, a, higher, cetane, rating, are, more, likely, to, ignite, and, hence, reduce, diesel, clatter, in, warmer, climates, diesel, engines, do, not, require, any, starting, aid, aside, from, the, starter, motor, however, many, diesel, engines, include, some, form, of, preheating, for, the, combustion, chamber, to, assist, starting, in, cold, conditions, engines, with, a, displacement, of, less, than, 1, litre, per, cylinder, usually, have, glowplugs, whilst, larger, heavy, duty, engines, have, flame, start, systems, the, minimum, starting, temperature, that, allows, starting, without, pre, heating, is, 40, c, 104, f, for, precombustion, chamber, engines, 20, c, 68, f, for, swirl, chamber, engines, and, 0, c, 32, f, for, direct, injected, engines, in, the, past, a, wider, variety, of, cold, start, methods, were, used, some, engines, such, as, detroit, diesel, engines, used, a, system, to, introduce, small, amounts, of, ether, into, the, inlet, manifold, to, start, combustion, instead, of, glowplugs, some, diesel, engines, are, equipped, with, starting, aid, systems, that, change, valve, timing, the, simplest, way, this, can, be, done, is, with, a, decompression, lever, activating, the, decompression, lever, locks, the, outlet, valves, in, a, slight, down, position, resulting, in, the, engine, not, having, any, compression, and, thus, allowing, for, turning, the, crankshaft, over, with, significantly, less, resistance, when, the, crankshaft, reaches, a, higher, speed, flipping, the, decompression, lever, back, into, its, normal, position, will, abruptly, re, activate, the, outlet, valves, resulting, in, compression, the, flywheel, s, mass, moment, of, inertia, then, starts, the, engine, other, diesel, engines, such, as, the, precombustion, chamber, engine, xii, jv, 170, 240, made, by, ganz, co, have, a, valve, timing, changing, system, that, is, operated, by, adjusting, the, inlet, valve, camshaft, moving, it, into, a, slight, late, position, this, will, make, the, inlet, valves, open, with, a, delay, forcing, the, inlet, air, to, heat, up, when, entering, the, combustion, chamber, forced, induction, especially, turbocharging, is, commonly, used, on, diesel, engines, because, it, greatly, increases, efficiency, and, torque, output, diesel, engines, are, well, suited, for, forced, induction, setups, due, to, their, operating, principle, which, is, characterised, by, wide, ignition, limits, and, the, absence, of, fuel, during, the, compression, stroke, therefore, knocking, pre, ignition, or, detonation, cannot, occur, and, a, lean, mixture, caused, by, excess, supercharging, air, inside, the, combustion, chamber, does, not, negatively, affect, combustion, diesel, engines, can, combust, a, huge, variety, of, fuels, including, several, fuel, oils, that, have, advantages, over, fuels, such, as, petrol, these, advantages, include, in, diesel, engines, a, mechanical, injector, system, atomizes, the, fuel, directly, into, the, combustion, chamber, as, opposed, to, a, venturi, jet, in, a, carburetor, or, a, fuel, injector, in, a, manifold, injection, system, atomizing, fuel, into, the, intake, manifold, or, intake, runners, as, in, a, petrol, engine, because, only, air, is, inducted, into, the, cylinder, in, a, diesel, engine, the, compression, ratio, can, be, much, higher, as, there, is, no, risk, of, pre, ignition, provided, the, injection, process, is, accurately, timed, this, means, that, cylinder, temperatures, are, much, higher, in, a, diesel, engine, than, a, petrol, engine, allowing, less, volatile, fuels, to, be, used, therefore, diesel, engines, can, operate, on, a, huge, variety, of, different, fuels, in, general, fuel, for, diesel, engines, should, have, a, proper, viscosity, so, that, the, injection, pump, can, pump, the, fuel, to, the, injection, nozzles, without, causing, damage, to, itself, or, corrosion, of, the, fuel, line, at, injection, the, fuel, should, form, a, good, fuel, spray, and, it, should, not, have, a, coking, effect, upon, the, injection, nozzles, to, ensure, proper, engine, starting, and, smooth, operation, the, fuel, should, be, willing, to, ignite, and, hence, not, cause, a, high, ignition, delay, this, means, that, the, fuel, should, have, a, high, cetane, number, diesel, fuel, should, also, have, a, high, lower, heating, value, inline, mechanical, injector, pumps, generally, tolerate, poor, quality, or, bio, fuels, better, than, distributor, type, pumps, also, indirect, injection, engines, generally, run, more, satisfactorily, on, fuels, with, a, high, ignition, delay, for, instance, petrol, than, direct, injection, engines, this, is, partly, because, an, indirect, injection, engine, has, a, much, greater, swirl, effect, improving, vaporisation, and, combustion, of, fuel, and, because, in, the, case, of, vegetable, oil, type, fuels, lipid, depositions, can, condense, on, the, cylinder, walls, of, a, direct, injection, engine, if, combustion, temperatures, are, too, low, such, as, starting, the, engine, from, cold, direct, injected, engines, with, an, man, centre, sphere, combustion, chamber, rely, on, fuel, condensing, on, the, combustion, chamber, walls, the, fuel, starts, vaporising, only, after, ignition, sets, in, and, it, burns, relatively, smoothly, therefore, such, engines, also, tolerate, fuels, with, poor, ignition, delay, characteristics, and, in, general, they, can, operate, on, petrol, rated, 86, ron, in, his, 1893, work, theory, and, construction, of, a, rational, heat, motor, rudolf, diesel, considers, using, coal, dust, as, fuel, for, the, diesel, engine, however, diesel, just, considered, using, coal, dust, as, well, as, liquid, fuels, and, gas, his, actual, engine, was, designed, to, operate, on, petroleum, which, was, soon, replaced, with, regular, petrol, and, kerosene, for, further, testing, purposes, as, petroleum, proved, to, be, too, viscous, in, addition, to, kerosene, and, petrol, diesel, s, engine, could, also, operate, on, ligroin, before, diesel, engine, fuel, was, standardised, fuels, such, as, petrol, kerosene, gas, oil, vegetable, oil, and, mineral, oil, as, well, as, mixtures, of, these, fuels, were, used, typical, fuels, specifically, intended, to, be, used, for, diesel, engines, were, petroleum, distillates, and, coal, tar, distillates, such, as, the, following, these, fuels, have, specific, lower, heating, values, of, source, the, first, diesel, fuel, standards, were, the, din, 51601, vtl, 9140, 001, and, nato, f, 54, which, appeared, after, world, war, ii, the, modern, european, en, 590, diesel, fuel, standard, was, established, in, may, 1993, the, modern, version, of, the, nato, f, 54, standard, is, mostly, identical, with, it, the, din, 51628, biodiesel, standard, was, rendered, obsolete, by, the, 2009, version, of, the, en, 590, fame, biodiesel, conforms, to, the, en, 14214, standard, watercraft, diesel, engines, usually, operate, on, diesel, engine, fuel, that, conforms, to, the, iso, 8217, standard, bunker, c, also, some, diesel, engines, can, operate, on, gasses, such, as, lng, din, 51601, diesel, fuel, was, prone, to, waxing, or, gelling, in, cold, weather, both, are, terms, for, the, solidification, of, diesel, oil, into, a, partially, crystalline, state, the, crystals, build, up, in, the, fuel, system, especially, in, fuel, filters, eventually, starving, the, engine, of, fuel, and, causing, it, to, stop, running, low, output, electric, heaters, in, fuel, tanks, and, around, fuel, lines, were, used, to, solve, this, problem, also, most, engines, have, a, spill, return, system, by, which, any, excess, fuel, from, the, injector, pump, and, injectors, is, returned, to, the, fuel, tank, once, the, engine, has, warmed, returning, warm, fuel, prevents, waxing, in, the, tank, before, direct, injection, diesel, engines, some, manufacturers, such, as, bmw, recommended, mixing, up, to, 30, petrol, in, with, the, diesel, by, fuelling, diesel, cars, with, petrol, to, prevent, the, fuel, from, gelling, when, the, temperatures, dropped, below, 15, c, diesel, fuel, is, less, flammable, than, petrol, because, its, flash, point, is, 55, c, leading, to, a, lower, risk, of, fire, caused, by, fuel, in, a, vehicle, equipped, with, a, diesel, engine, diesel, fuel, can, create, an, explosive, air, vapour, mix, under, the, right, conditions, however, compared, with, petrol, it, is, less, prone, due, to, its, lower, vapour, pressure, which, is, an, indication, of, evaporation, rate, the, material, safety, data, sheet, for, ultra, low, sulfur, diesel, fuel, indicates, a, vapour, explosion, hazard, for, diesel, fuel, indoors, outdoors, or, in, sewers, diesel, exhaust, has, been, classified, as, an, iarc, group, 1, carcinogen, it, causes, lung, cancer, and, is, associated, with, an, increased, risk, for, bladder, cancer, see, diesel, engine, runaway, the, characteristics, of, diesel, have, different, advantages, for, different, applications, diesel, engines, have, long, been, popular, in, bigger, cars, and, have, been, used, in, smaller, cars, such, as, superminis, in, europe, since, the, 1980s, they, were, popular, in, larger, cars, earlier, as, the, weight, and, cost, penalties, were, less, noticeable, smooth, operation, as, well, as, high, low, end, torque, are, deemed, important, for, passenger, cars, and, small, commercial, vehicles, the, introduction, of, electronically, controlled, fuel, injection, significantly, improved, the, smooth, torque, generation, and, starting, in, the, early, 1990s, car, manufacturers, began, offering, their, high, end, luxury, vehicles, with, diesel, engines, passenger, car, diesel, engines, usually, have, between, three, and, twelve, cylinders, and, a, displacement, ranging, from, 0, 8, to, 6, 0, litres, modern, powerplants, are, usually, turbocharged, and, have, direct, injection, diesel, engines, do, not, suffer, from, intake, air, throttling, resulting, in, very, low, fuel, consumption, especially, at, low, partial, load, for, instance, driving, at, city, speeds, one, fifth, of, all, passenger, cars, worldwide, have, diesel, engines, with, many, of, them, being, in, europe, where, approximately, 47, of, all, passenger, cars, are, diesel, powered, daimler, benz, in, conjunction, with, robert, bosch, gmbh, produced, diesel, powered, passenger, cars, starting, in, 1936, the, popularity, of, diesel, powered, passenger, cars, in, markets, such, as, india, south, korea, and, japan, is, increasing, as, of, 2018, in, 1893, rudolf, diesel, suggested, that, the, diesel, engine, could, possibly, power, wagons, lorries, the, first, lorries, with, diesel, engines, were, brought, to, market, in, 1924, modern, diesel, engines, for, lorries, have, to, be, both, extremely, reliable, and, very, fuel, efficient, common, rail, direct, injection, turbocharging, and, four, valves, per, cylinder, are, standard, displacements, range, from, 4, 5, to, 15, 5, litres, with, power, to, mass, ratios, of, 2, 5, 3, 5, kg, kw, 1, for, heavy, duty, and, 2, 0, 3, 0, kg, kw, 1, for, medium, duty, engines, v6, and, v8, engines, used, to, be, common, due, to, the, relatively, low, engine, mass, the, v, configuration, provides, recently, the, v, configuration, has, been, abandoned, in, favour, of, straight, engines, these, engines, are, usually, straight, 6, for, heavy, and, medium, duties, and, straight, 4, for, medium, duty, their, undersquare, design, causes, lower, overall, piston, speeds, which, results, in, increased, lifespan, of, up, to, 1, 200, 000, kilometres, 750, 000, mi, compared, with, 1970s, diesel, engines, the, expected, lifespan, of, modern, lorry, diesel, engines, has, more, than, doubled, diesel, engines, for, locomotives, are, built, for, continuous, operation, between, refuelings, and, may, need, to, be, designed, to, use, poor, quality, fuel, in, some, circumstances, some, locomotives, use, two, stroke, diesel, engines, diesel, engines, have, replaced, steam, engines, on, all, non, electrified, railroads, in, the, world, the, first, diesel, locomotives, appeared, in, 1913, and, diesel, multiple, units, soon, after, nearly, all, modern, diesel, locomotives, are, more, correctly, known, as, diesel, electric, locomotives, because, they, use, an, electric, transmission, the, diesel, engine, drives, an, electric, generator, which, powers, electric, traction, motors, while, electric, locomotives, have, replaced, the, diesel, locomotive, for, passenger, services, in, many, areas, diesel, traction, is, widely, used, for, cargo, hauling, freight, trains, and, on, tracks, where, electrification, is, not, economically, viable, in, the, 1940s, road, vehicle, diesel, engines, with, power, outputs, of, 150, 200, metric, horsepower, 110, 150, kw, 150, 200, hp, were, considered, reasonable, for, dmus, commonly, regular, truck, powerplants, were, used, the, height, of, these, engines, had, to, be, less, than, 1, metre, 3, ft, 3, in, to, allow, underfloor, installation, usually, the, engine, was, mated, with, a, pneumatically, operated, mechanical, gearbox, due, to, the, low, size, mass, and, production, costs, of, this, design, some, dmus, used, hydraulic, torque, converters, instead, diesel, electric, transmission, was, not, suitable, for, such, small, engines, in, the, 1930s, the, deutsche, reichsbahn, standardised, its, first, dmu, engine, it, was, a, 30, 3, litres, 1, 850, cu, in, 12, cylinder, boxer, unit, producing, 275, metric, horsepower, 202, kw, 271, hp, several, german, manufacturers, produced, engines, according, to, this, standard, the, requirements, for, marine, diesel, engines, vary, depending, on, the, application, for, military, use, and, medium, size, boats, medium, speed, four, stroke, diesel, engines, are, most, suitable, these, engines, usually, have, up, to, 24, cylinders, and, come, with, power, outputs, in, the, one, digit, megawatt, region, small, boats, may, use, lorry, diesel, engines, large, ships, use, extremely, efficient, low, speed, two, stroke, diesel, engines, they, can, reach, efficiencies, of, up, to, 55, unlike, most, regular, diesel, engines, two, stroke, watercraft, engines, use, highly, viscous, fuel, oil, submarines, are, usually, diesel, electric, the, first, diesel, engines, for, ships, were, made, by, a, b, diesels, motorer, stockholm, in, 1903, these, engines, were, three, cylinder, units, of, 120, ps, 88, kw, and, four, cylinder, units, of, 180, ps, 132, kw, and, used, for, russian, ships, in, world, war, i, especially, submarine, diesel, engine, development, advanced, quickly, by, the, end, of, the, war, double, acting, piston, two, stroke, engines, with, up, to, 12, 200, ps, 9, mw, had, been, made, for, marine, use, diesel, engines, had, been, used, in, aircraft, before, world, war, ii, for, instance, in, the, rigid, airship, lz, 129, hindenburg, which, was, powered, by, four, daimler, benz, db, 602, diesel, engines, or, in, several, junkers, aircraft, which, had, jumo, 205, engines, installed, in, 1929, in, the, united, states, the, packard, motor, company, developed, america, s, first, aircraft, diesel, engine, the, packard, dr, 980, an, air, cooled, 9, cylinder, radial, engine, they, installed, it, in, various, aircraft, of, the, era, some, of, which, were, used, in, record, breaking, distance, or, endurance, flights, and, in, the, first, successful, demonstration, of, ground, to, air, radiophone, communications, voice, radio, having, been, previously, unintelligible, in, aircraft, equipped, with, spark, ignition, engines, due, to, electromagnetic, interference, additional, advantages, cited, at, the, time, included, a, lower, risk, of, post, crash, fire, and, superior, performance, at, high, altitudes, on, march, 6, 1930, the, engine, received, an, approved, type, certificate, first, ever, for, an, aircraft, diesel, engine, from, the, u, s, department, of, commerce, however, noxious, exhaust, fumes, cold, start, and, vibration, problems, engine, structural, failures, the, death, of, its, developer, and, the, industrial, economic, contraction, of, the, great, depression, combined, to, kill, the, program, from, then, until, the, late, 1970s, there, had, not, been, many, applications, of, the, diesel, engine, in, aircraft, in, 1978, piper, cherokee, co, designer, karl, h, bergey, argued, that, the, likelihood, of, a, general, aviation, diesel, in, the, near, future, is, remote, however, with, the, 1970s, energy, crisis, and, environmental, movement, and, resulting, pressures, for, greater, fuel, economy, reduced, carbon, and, lead, in, the, atmosphere, and, other, issues, there, was, a, resurgence, of, interest, in, diesel, engines, for, aircraft, high, compression, piston, aircraft, engines, that, run, on, aviation, gasoline, avgas, generally, require, the, addition, of, toxic, tetraethyl, lead, to, avgas, to, avoid, engine, pre, ignition, and, detonation, but, diesel, engines, do, not, require, leaded, fuel, also, biodiesel, can, theoretically, provide, a, net, reduction, in, atmospheric, carbon, compared, to, avgas, for, these, reasons, the, general, aviation, community, has, begun, to, fear, the, possible, banning, or, discontinuance, of, leaded, avgas, additionally, avgas, is, a, specialty, fuel, in, very, low, and, declining, demand, compared, to, other, fuels, and, its, makers, are, susceptible, to, costly, aviation, crash, lawsuits, reducing, refiners, interest, in, producing, it, outside, the, united, states, avgas, has, already, become, increasingly, difficult, to, find, at, airports, and, generally, than, less, expensive, diesel, compatible, fuels, like, jet, a, and, other, jet, fuels, by, the, late, 1990s, early, 2000s, diesel, engines, were, beginning, to, appear, in, light, aircraft, most, notably, frank, thielert, and, his, austrian, engine, enterprise, began, developing, diesel, engines, to, replace, the, 100, horsepower, 75, kw, 350, horsepower, 260, kw, gasoline, piston, engines, in, common, light, aircraft, use, first, successful, application, of, the, theilerts, to, production, aircraft, was, in, the, diamond, da42, twin, star, light, twin, which, exhibited, exceptional, fuel, efficiency, surpassing, anything, in, its, class, and, its, single, seat, predecessor, the, diamond, da40, diamond, star, in, subsequent, years, several, other, companies, have, developed, aircraft, diesel, engines, or, have, begun, to, most, notably, continental, aerospace, technologies, which, by, 2018, was, reporting, it, had, sold, over, 5, 000, such, engines, worldwide, the, united, states, federal, aviation, administration, has, reported, that, by, 2007, various, jet, fueled, piston, aircraft, had, logged, well, over, 600, 000, hours, of, service, in, early, 2019, aopa, reported, that, a, diesel, engine, model, for, general, aviation, aircraft, is, approaching, the, finish, line, by, late, 2022, continental, was, reporting, that, its, jet, a, fueled, engines, had, exceeded, 2, 000, in, operation, today, with, over, 9, million, hours, and, were, being, specified, by, major, oems, for, cessna, piper, diamond, mooney, tecnam, glasair, and, robin, aircraft, in, recent, years, 2016, diesel, engines, have, also, found, use, in, unmanned, aircraft, uav, due, to, their, reliability, durability, and, low, fuel, consumption, non, road, diesel, engines, are, commonly, used, for, construction, equipment, and, agricultural, machinery, fuel, efficiency, reliability, and, ease, of, maintenance, are, very, important, for, such, engines, whilst, high, power, output, and, quiet, operation, are, negligible, therefore, mechanically, controlled, fuel, injection, and, air, cooling, are, still, very, common, the, common, power, outputs, of, non, road, diesel, engines, vary, a, lot, with, the, smallest, units, starting, at, 3, kw, and, the, most, powerful, engines, being, heavy, duty, lorry, engines, stationary, diesel, engines, are, commonly, used, for, electricity, generation, but, also, for, powering, refrigerator, compressors, or, other, types, of, compressors, or, pumps, usually, these, engines, either, run, continuously, with, partial, load, or, intermittently, with, full, load, stationary, diesel, engines, powering, electric, generators, that, put, out, an, alternating, current, usually, operate, with, alternating, load, but, fixed, rotational, frequency, this, is, due, to, the, mains, fixed, frequency, of, either, 50, hz, europe, or, 60, hz, united, states, the, engine, s, crankshaft, rotational, frequency, is, chosen, so, that, the, mains, frequency, is, a, multiple, of, it, for, practical, reasons, this, results, in, crankshaft, rotational, frequencies, of, either, 25, hz, 1500, per, minute, or, 30, hz, 1800, per, minute, a, special, class, of, prototype, internal, combustion, piston, engines, has, been, developed, over, several, decades, with, the, goal, of, improving, efficiency, by, reducing, heat, loss, these, engines, are, variously, called, adiabatic, engines, due, to, better, approximation, of, adiabatic, expansion, low, heat, rejection, engines, or, high, temperature, engines, they, are, generally, piston, engines, with, combustion, chamber, parts, lined, with, ceramic, thermal, barrier, coatings, some, make, use, of, pistons, and, other, parts, made, of, titanium, which, has, a, low, thermal, conductivity, and, density, some, designs, are, able, to, eliminate, the, use, of, a, cooling, system, and, associated, parasitic, losses, altogether, developing, lubricants, able, to, withstand, the, higher, temperatures, involved, has, been, a, major, barrier, to, commercialization, in, mid, 2010s, literature, main, development, goals, for, future, diesel, engines, are, described, as, improvements, of, exhaust, emissions, reduction, of, fuel, consumption, and, increase, of, lifespan, 2014, it, is, said, that, the, diesel, engine, especially, the, diesel, engine, for, commercial, vehicles, will, remain, the, most, important, vehicle, powerplant, until, the, mid, 2030s, editors, assume, that, the, complexity, of, the, diesel, engine, will, increase, further, 2014, some, editors, expect, a, future, convergency, of, diesel, and, otto, engines, operating, principles, due, to, otto, engine, development, steps, made, towards, homogeneous, charge, compression, ignition,
