https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballista
the, ballista, latin, from, greek, ballistra, and, that, from, ball, throw, plural, ballistae, sometimes, called, bolt, thrower, was, an, ancient, missile, weapon, that, launched, either, bolts, or, stones, at, a, distant, target, developed, from, earlier, greek, weapons, it, relied, upon, different, mechanics, using, two, levers, with, torsion, springs, instead, of, a, tension, prod, the, bow, part, of, a, modern, crossbow, the, springs, consisted, of, several, loops, of, twisted, skeins, early, versions, projected, heavy, darts, or, spherical, stone, projectiles, of, various, sizes, for, siege, warfare, it, developed, into, a, smaller, precision, weapon, the, scorpio, and, possibly, the, polybolos, the, early, ballistae, in, ancient, greece, were, developed, from, two, weapons, called, oxybeles, and, gastraphetes, the, gastraphetes, belly, bow, was, a, handheld, crossbow, it, had, a, composite, prod, and, was, spanned, by, bracing, the, front, end, of, the, weapon, against, the, ground, while, placing, the, end, of, a, slider, mechanism, against, the, stomach, the, operator, would, then, walk, forward, to, arm, the, weapon, while, a, ratchet, prevented, it, from, shooting, during, loading, this, produced, a, weapon, that, it, was, claimed, could, be, operated, by, a, person, of, average, strength, but, which, had, a, power, that, allowed, it, to, be, successfully, used, against, armored, troops, the, oxybeles, were, a, bigger, and, heavier, construction, employing, a, winch, and, were, mounted, on, a, tripod, it, had, a, lower, rate, of, fire, and, was, used, as, a, siege, engine, with, the, invention, of, the, torsion, spring, bundle, the, first, ballistae, could, now, be, built, the, advantage, of, this, new, technology, was, the, fast, relaxation, time, of, this, system, thus, it, was, possible, to, shoot, lighter, projectiles, with, higher, velocities, over, a, longer, distance, by, contrast, the, comparatively, slow, relaxation, time, of, the, bow, or, prod, of, a, conventional, crossbow, such, as, the, oxybeles, meant, that, much, less, energy, could, be, transferred, to, light, projectiles, limiting, the, effective, range, of, the, weapon, the, earliest, form, of, the, ballista, is, thought, to, have, been, developed, for, dionysius, of, syracuse, c, 400, bc, the, greek, ballista, was, a, siege, weapon, all, components, that, were, not, made, of, wood, were, transported, in, the, baggage, train, it, would, be, assembled, with, local, wood, if, necessary, some, were, positioned, inside, large, armored, mobile, siege, towers, or, even, on, the, edge, of, a, battlefield, for, all, of, the, tactical, advantages, offered, it, was, only, under, philip, ii, of, macedon, and, even, more, so, under, his, son, alexander, that, the, ballista, began, to, develop, and, gain, recognition, as, both, a, siege, engine, and, field, artillery, historical, accounts, for, instance, cited, that, philip, ii, employed, a, group, of, engineers, within, his, army, to, design, and, build, catapults, for, his, military, campaigns, there, is, even, a, claim, that, it, was, philip, ii, with, his, team, of, engineers, who, invented, the, ballista, after, improving, dionysius, s, device, which, was, merely, an, oversized, slingshot, it, was, further, perfected, by, alexander, whose, own, team, of, engineers, introduced, innovations, such, as, the, idea, of, using, springs, made, from, tightly, strung, coils, of, rope, instead, of, a, bow, to, achieve, more, energy, and, power, when, throwing, projectiles, polybius, reported, about, the, usage, of, smaller, more, portable, ballistae, called, scorpions, during, the, second, punic, war, ballistae, could, be, easily, modified, to, shoot, both, spherical, and, shaft, projectiles, allowing, their, crews, to, adapt, quickly, to, prevailing, battlefield, situations, in, real, time, as, the, role, of, battlefield, artillery, became, more, sophisticated, a, universal, joint, which, was, invented, just, for, this, function, was, integrated, into, the, ballista, s, stand, allowing, the, operators, to, alter, the, trajectory, and, firing, direction, of, the, ballista, as, required, without, a, lengthy, disassembly, of, the, machine, after, the, absorption, of, the, ancient, greek, city, states, into, the, roman, republic, in, 146, bc, the, highly, advanced, greek, technology, began, to, spread, across, many, areas, of, roman, influence, this, included, the, great, military, machine, advances, the, greeks, had, made, most, notably, by, dionysus, of, syracuse, as, well, as, all, the, scientific, mathematical, political, and, artistic, developments, the, romans, adopted, the, torsion, powered, ballista, which, had, by, now, spread, to, several, cities, around, the, mediterranean, all, of, which, became, roman, spoils, of, war, including, one, from, pergamon, which, was, depicted, among, a, pile, of, trophy, weapons, in, relief, on, a, balustrade, the, torsion, ballista, developed, by, alexander, was, a, far, more, complicated, weapon, than, its, predecessor, and, the, romans, developed, it, even, further, especially, into, much, smaller, versions, that, could, be, easily, carried, the, early, roman, ballistae, were, made, of, wood, and, held, together, with, iron, plates, around, the, frames, and, iron, nails, in, the, stand, the, main, stand, had, a, slider, on, the, top, into, which, were, loaded, the, bolts, or, stone, shot, attached, to, this, at, the, back, was, a, pair, of, winches, and, a, claw, used, to, ratchet, the, bowstring, back, to, the, armed, firing, position, the, slider, passed, through, the, field, frames, of, the, weapon, in, which, were, located, the, torsion, springs, rope, made, of, animal, sinew, which, were, twisted, around, the, bow, arms, which, in, turn, were, attached, to, the, bowstring, drawing, the, bowstring, back, with, the, winches, twisted, the, already, taut, springs, storing, the, energy, to, fire, the, projectiles, the, bronze, or, iron, caps, which, secured, the, torsion, bundles, were, adjustable, by, means, of, pins, and, peripheral, holes, which, allowed, the, weapon, to, be, tuned, for, symmetrical, power, and, for, changing, weather, conditions, the, ballista, was, a, highly, accurate, weapon, there, are, many, accounts, of, single, soldiers, being, picked, off, by, ballistarii, but, some, design, aspects, meant, it, could, compromise, its, accuracy, for, range, the, maximum, range, was, over, 500, yards, 460, m, but, the, effective, combat, range, for, many, targets, was, far, shorter, the, romans, continued, the, development, of, the, ballista, and, it, became, a, highly, prized, and, valued, weapon, in, the, army, of, the, roman, empire, it, was, used, just, before, the, start, of, the, empire, by, julius, caesar, during, his, conquest, of, gaul, and, on, both, of, his, campaigns, in, subduing, britain, the, first, of, caesar, s, invasions, of, britain, took, place, in, 55, bc, after, a, rapid, and, successful, initial, conquest, of, gaul, in, part, as, an, expedition, and, more, practical, to, try, to, put, an, end, to, the, reinforcements, sent, by, the, native, britons, to, fight, the, romans, in, gaul, a, total, of, eighty, means, of, transport, carrying, two, legions, attempted, to, land, on, the, british, shore, only, to, be, driven, back, by, the, many, british, warriors, assembled, along, the, shoreline, the, ships, had, to, unload, their, troops, on, the, beach, as, it, was, the, only, one, suitable, for, many, miles, yet, the, massed, ranks, of, british, charioteers, and, javeliners, were, making, it, difficult, seeing, this, caesar, ordered, the, warships, which, were, swifter, and, easier, to, handle, than, the, transports, and, likely, to, impress, the, natives, more, by, their, unfamiliar, appearance, to, be, removed, a, short, distance, from, the, others, and, then, be, rowed, hard, and, run, ashore, on, the, enemy, s, right, flank, from, which, position, men, on, deck, could, use, the, slings, bows, and, artillery, to, drive, them, back, this, maneuver, was, highly, successful, scared, by, the, strange, shape, of, the, warships, the, motion, of, the, oars, and, the, unfamiliar, machines, the, natives, halted, and, retreated, caesar, the, conquest, of, gaul, p, 99, in, gaul, the, stronghold, of, alesia, was, under, a, roman, siege, in, 52, bc, and, was, completely, surrounded, by, a, roman, fortification, including, a, wooden, palisade, and, towers, as, was, standard, siege, technique, at, the, time, small, ballistae, were, placed, in, the, towers, with, other, troops, armed, with, bows, or, slings, the, use, of, the, ballista, in, the, roman, siege, strategy, was, also, demonstrated, in, the, case, of, the, siege, of, masada, during, the, conquest, of, the, empire, the, ballista, proved, its, worth, many, times, in, sieges, and, battles, both, at, sea, and, on, land, it, is, from, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, that, many, of, the, archaeological, finds, of, ballistae, date, accounts, by, the, finders, including, technical, manuals, and, journals, are, used, today, by, archaeologists, to, reconstruct, these, weapons, after, julius, caesar, the, ballista, was, a, permanent, fixture, in, the, roman, army, and, over, time, modifications, and, improvements, were, made, by, successive, engineers, this, included, replacing, the, remaining, wooden, parts, of, the, machine, with, metal, creating, a, much, smaller, lighter, and, more, powerful, machine, than, the, wooden, version, which, required, less, maintenance, though, the, vital, torsion, springs, were, still, vulnerable, to, the, strain, the, largest, ballistae, of, the, 4th, century, could, throw, a, dart, further, than, 1200, yards, 1, 100, m, the, weapon, was, named, ballista, fulminalis, in, de, rebus, bellicis, from, this, ballista, darts, were, projected, not, only, in, great, number, but, also, at, a, large, size, over, a, considerable, distance, such, as, across, the, width, of, the, danube, river, ballistae, were, not, only, used, in, laying, siege, after, ad, 350, at, least, 22, semi, circular, towers, were, erected, around, the, walls, of, londinium, london, to, provide, platforms, for, permanently, mounted, defensive, devices, during, the, 6th, century, procopius, described, the, effects, of, this, weapon, but, belisarius, placed, upon, the, towers, engines, which, they, call, ballistae, now, these, engines, have, the, form, of, a, bow, but, on, the, under, side, of, them, a, grooved, wooden, shaft, projects, this, shaft, is, so, fitted, to, the, bow, that, it, is, free, to, move, and, rests, upon, a, straight, iron, bed, so, when, men, wish, to, shoot, at, the, enemy, with, this, they, make, the, parts, of, the, bow, which, form, the, ends, bend, toward, one, another, by, means, of, a, short, rope, fastened, to, them, and, they, place, in, the, grooved, shaft, the, arrow, which, is, about, one, half, the, length, of, the, ordinary, missiles, which, they, shoot, from, bows, but, about, four, times, as, wide, but, the, missile, is, discharged, from, the, shaft, and, with, such, force, that, it, attains, the, distance, of, not, less, than, two, bow, shots, and, that, when, it, hits, a, tree, or, a, rock, it, pierces, it, easily, such, is, the, engine, which, bears, this, name, being, so, called, because, it, shoots, with, very, great, force, the, missiles, were, able, to, penetrate, body, armour, and, at, the, salarian, gate, a, goth, of, goodly, stature, and, a, capable, warrior, wearing, a, corselet, and, having, a, helmet, on, his, head, a, man, who, was, of, no, mean, station, in, the, gothic, nation, refused, to, remain, in, the, ranks, with, his, comrades, but, stood, by, a, tree, and, kept, shooting, many, missiles, at, the, parapet, but, this, man, by, some, chance, was, hit, by, a, missile, from, an, engine, which, was, on, a, tower, at, his, left, and, passing, through, the, corselet, and, the, body, of, the, man, the, missile, sank, more, than, half, its, length, into, the, tree, and, pinning, him, to, the, spot, where, it, entered, the, tree, it, suspended, him, there, a, corpse, the, carroballista, was, a, cart, mounted, version, of, the, weapon, there, were, probably, different, models, of, ballista, under, the, cheiroballistra, class, at, least, two, different, two, wheeled, models, and, one, model, with, four, wheels, their, probable, size, was, roughly, 1, 47, m, 4, ft, 10, in, width, i, e, 5, roman, feet, the, cart, system, and, structure, gave, it, a, great, deal, of, flexibility, and, capability, as, a, battlefield, weapon, since, the, increased, maneuverability, allowed, it, to, be, moved, with, the, flow, of, the, battle, this, weapon, features, several, times, on, trajan, s, column, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, roman, military, may, have, also, fielded, a, repeating, ballista, also, known, as, a, polybolos, reconstruction, and, trials, of, such, a, weapon, carried, out, in, a, bbc, documentary, what, the, romans, did, for, us, showed, that, they, were, able, to, shoot, eleven, bolts, a, minute, which, is, almost, four, times, the, rate, at, which, an, ordinary, ballista, can, be, operated, however, no, example, of, such, a, weapon, has, been, found, by, archaeologists, the, cheiroballistra, and, the, manuballista, are, held, by, many, archaeologists, to, be, the, same, weapon, the, difference, in, name, may, be, attributable, to, the, different, languages, spoken, in, the, empire, latin, remained, the, official, language, in, the, western, empire, but, the, eastern, empire, predominantly, used, greek, which, added, an, extra, r, to, the, word, ballista, the, manuballista, was, a, handheld, version, of, the, traditional, ballista, this, new, version, was, made, entirely, of, iron, which, conferred, greater, power, to, the, weapon, since, it, was, smaller, and, less, iron, an, expensive, material, before, the, 19th, century, was, used, in, its, production, it, was, not, the, ancient, gastraphetes, but, the, roman, weapon, however, the, same, physical, limitations, applied, as, with, the, gastraphetes, archaeology, and, in, particular, experimental, archaeology, has, been, influential, on, this, subject, although, several, ancient, authors, such, as, vegetius, wrote, very, detailed, technical, treatises, providing, us, with, all, the, information, necessary, to, reconstruct, the, weapons, all, their, measurements, were, in, their, native, language, and, therefore, highly, difficult, to, translate, attempts, to, reconstruct, these, ancient, weapons, began, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, based, on, rough, translations, of, ancient, authors, it, was, only, during, the, 20th, century, however, that, many, of, the, reconstructions, began, to, make, any, sense, as, a, weapon, by, bringing, in, modern, engineers, progress, was, made, with, the, ancient, systems, of, measurement, by, redesigning, the, reconstructions, using, the, new, information, archaeologists, in, that, specialty, were, able, to, recognise, certain, finds, from, roman, military, sites, and, identify, them, as, ballistae, the, information, gained, from, the, excavations, was, fed, into, the, next, generation, of, reconstructions, and, so, on, sites, across, the, empire, have, yielded, information, on, ballistae, from, spain, the, ampurias, catapult, to, italy, the, cremona, battleshield, which, proved, that, the, weapons, had, decorative, metal, plates, to, shield, the, operators, to, iraq, the, hatra, machine, and, even, scotland, burnswark, siege, tactics, training, camp, and, many, other, sites, between, the, most, influential, archaeologists, in, this, area, have, been, peter, connolly, and, eric, marsden, who, have, not, only, written, extensively, on, the, subject, but, have, also, made, many, reconstructions, themselves, and, have, refined, the, designs, over, many, years, of, work, with, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, resources, to, build, and, maintain, these, complex, machines, became, very, scarce, so, the, ballista, was, likely, supplanted, initially, by, the, simpler, and, cheaper, onager, and, the, more, efficient, springald, however, while, it, remained, less, and, less, popular, as, more, efficient, siege, engines, such, as, the, trebuchet, and, the, mangonel, became, widespread, the, ballista, still, retained, some, use, in, medieval, siege, warfare, especially, by, city, and, castle, garrisons, until, it, became, finally, extinguished, by, the, more, convenient, medieval, canons, already, omnipresent, in, all, major, european, catholic, cities, by, the, first, half, of, the, 14th, century, the, littere, wallie, records, the, existence, of, 4, balistas, ad, turrimi, at, duluithelan, castle, in, 1280, one, balistam, de, tur, at, rothelano, castle, and, one, magnam, ballistam, at, bere, blada, castle, in, 1286, these, all, being, held, under, the, authority, of, the, english, crown, in, remote, and, seemingly, savage, places, like, ireland, however, where, cannons, were, rare, and, personal, firearms, were, almost, non, existent, ballistae, had, recorded, use, well, into, late, 15th, century, while, not, a, direct, descendant, mechanically, the, concept, and, naming, continues, on, as, arbalest, crossbows, arcus, bow, ballista
