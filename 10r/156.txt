with, a, bachelor, s, degree, the, field, of, mechanical, engineering, can, be, thought, of, as, a, collection, of, many, mechanical, engineering, science, disciplines, several, of, these, subdisciplines, which, are, typically, taught, at, the, undergraduate, level, are, listed, below, with, a, brief, explanation, and, the, most, common, application, of, each, some, of, these, subdisciplines, are, unique, to, mechanical, engineering, while, others, are, a, combination, of, mechanical, engineering, and, one, or, more, other, disciplines, most, work, that, a, mechanical, engineer, does, uses, skills, and, techniques, from, several, of, these, subdisciplines, as, well, as, specialized, subdisciplines, specialized, subdisciplines, as, used, in, this, article, are, more, likely, to, be, the, subject, of, graduate, studies, or, on, the, job, training, than, undergraduate, research, several, specialized, subdisciplines, are, discussed, in, this, section, mechanics, is, in, the, most, general, sense, the, study, of, forces, and, their, effect, upon, matter, typically, engineering, mechanics, is, used, to, analyze, and, predict, the, acceleration, and, deformation, both, elastic, and, plastic, of, objects, under, known, forces, also, called, loads, or, stresses, subdisciplines, of, mechanics, include, mechanical, engineers, typically, use, mechanics, in, the, design, or, analysis, phases, of, engineering, if, the, engineering, project, were, the, design, of, a, vehicle, statics, might, be, employed, to, design, the, frame, of, the, vehicle, in, order, to, evaluate, where, the, stresses, will, be, most, intense, dynamics, might, be, used, when, designing, the, car, s, engine, to, evaluate, the, forces, in, the, pistons, and, cams, as, the, engine, cycles, mechanics, of, materials, might, be, used, to, choose, appropriate, materials, for, the, frame, and, engine, fluid, mechanics, might, be, used, to, design, a, ventilation, system, for, the, vehicle, see, hvac, or, to, design, the, intake, system, for, the, engine, mechatronics, is, a, combination, of, mechanics, and, electronics, it, is, an, interdisciplinary, branch, of, mechanical, engineering, electrical, engineering, and, software, engineering, that, is, concerned, with, integrating, electrical, and, mechanical, engineering, to, create, hybrid, automation, systems, in, this, way, machines, can, be, automated, through, the, use, of, electric, motors, servo, mechanisms, and, other, electrical, systems, in, conjunction, with, special, software, a, common, example, of, a, mechatronics, system, is, a, cd, rom, drive, mechanical, systems, open, and, close, the, drive, spin, the, cd, and, move, the, laser, while, an, optical, system, reads, the, data, on, the, cd, and, converts, it, to, bits, integrated, software, controls, the, process, and, communicates, the, contents, of, the, cd, to, the, computer, robotics, is, the, application, of, mechatronics, to, create, robots, which, are, often, used, in, industry, to, perform, tasks, that, are, dangerous, unpleasant, or, repetitive, these, robots, may, be, of, any, shape, and, size, but, all, are, preprogrammed, and, interact, physically, with, the, world, to, create, a, robot, an, engineer, typically, employs, kinematics, to, determine, the, robot, s, range, of, motion, and, mechanics, to, determine, the, stresses, within, the, robot, robots, are, used, extensively, in, industrial, automation, engineering, they, allow, businesses, to, save, money, on, labor, perform, tasks, that, are, either, too, dangerous, or, too, precise, for, humans, to, perform, them, economically, and, to, ensure, better, quality, many, companies, employ, assembly, lines, of, robots, especially, in, automotive, industries, and, some, factories, are, so, robotized, that, they, can, run, by, themselves, outside, the, factory, robots, have, been, employed, in, bomb, disposal, space, exploration, and, many, other, fields, robots, are, also, sold, for, various, residential, applications, from, recreation, to, domestic, applications, structural, analysis, is, the, branch, of, mechanical, engineering, and, also, civil, engineering, devoted, to, examining, why, and, how, objects, fail, and, to, fix, the, objects, and, their, performance, structural, failures, occur, in, two, general, modes, static, failure, and, fatigue, failure, static, structural, failure, occurs, when, upon, being, loaded, having, a, force, applied, the, object, being, analyzed, either, breaks, or, is, deformed, plastically, depending, on, the, criterion, for, failure, fatigue, failure, occurs, when, an, object, fails, after, a, number, of, repeated, loading, and, unloading, cycles, fatigue, failure, occurs, because, of, imperfections, in, the, object, a, microscopic, crack, on, the, surface, of, the, object, for, instance, will, grow, slightly, with, each, cycle, propagation, until, the, crack, is, large, enough, to, cause, ultimate, failure, failure, is, not, simply, defined, as, when, a, part, breaks, however, it, is, defined, as, when, a, part, does, not, operate, as, intended, some, systems, such, as, the, perforated, top, sections, of, some, plastic, bags, are, designed, to, break, if, these, systems, do, not, break, failure, analysis, might, be, employed, to, determine, the, cause, structural, analysis, is, often, used, by, mechanical, engineers, after, a, failure, has, occurred, or, when, designing, to, prevent, failure, engineers, often, use, online, documents, and, books, such, as, those, published, by, asm, to, aid, them, in, determining, the, type, of, failure, and, possible, causes, once, theory, is, applied, to, a, mechanical, design, physical, testing, is, often, performed, to, verify, calculated, results, structural, analysis, may, be, used, in, an, office, when, designing, parts, in, the, field, to, analyze, failed, parts, or, in, laboratories, where, parts, might, undergo, controlled, failure, tests, thermodynamics, is, an, applied, science, used, in, several, branches, of, engineering, including, mechanical, and, chemical, engineering, at, its, simplest, thermodynamics, is, the, study, of, energy, its, use, and, transformation, through, a, system, typically, engineering, thermodynamics, is, concerned, with, changing, energy, from, one, form, to, another, as, an, example, automotive, engines, convert, chemical, energy, enthalpy, from, the, fuel, into, heat, and, then, into, mechanical, work, that, eventually, turns, the, wheels, thermodynamics, principles, are, used, by, mechanical, engineers, in, the, fields, of, heat, transfer, thermofluids, and, energy, conversion, mechanical, engineers, use, thermo, science, to, design, engines, and, power, plants, heating, ventilation, and, air, conditioning, hvac, systems, heat, exchangers, heat, sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and, others, drafting, or, technical, drawing, is, the, means, by, which, mechanical, engineers, design, products, and, create, instructions, for, manufacturing, parts, a, technical, drawing, can, be, a, computer, model, or, hand, drawn, schematic, showing, all, the, dimensions, necessary, to, manufacture, a, part, as, well, as, assembly, notes, a, list, of, required, materials, and, other, pertinent, information, a, u, s, mechanical, engineer, or, skilled, worker, who, creates, technical, drawings, may, be, referred, to, as, a, drafter, or, draftsman, drafting, has, historically, been, a, two, dimensional, process, but, computer, aided, design, cad, programs, now, allow, the, designer, to, create, in, three, dimensions, instructions, for, manufacturing, a, part, must, be, fed, to, the, necessary, machinery, either, manually, through, programmed, instructions, or, through, the, use, of, a, computer, aided, manufacturing, cam, or, combined, cad, cam, program, optionally, an, engineer, may, also, manually, manufacture, a, part, using, the, technical, drawings, however, with, the, advent, of, computer, numerically, controlled, cnc, manufacturing, parts, can, now, be, fabricated, without, the, need, for, constant, technician, input, manually, manufactured, parts, generally, consist, of, spray, coatings, surface, finishes, and, other, processes, that, cannot, economically, or, practically, be, done, by, a, machine, drafting, is, used, in, nearly, every, subdiscipline, of, mechanical, engineering, and, by, many, other, branches, of, engineering, and, architecture, three, dimensional, models, created, using, cad, software, are, also, commonly, used, in, finite, element, analysis, fea, and, computational, fluid, dynamics, cfd, many, mechanical, engineering, companies, especially, those, in, industrialized, nations, have, incorporated, computer, aided, engineering, cae, programs, into, their, existing, design, and, analysis, processes, including, 2d, and, 3d, solid, modeling, computer, aided, design, cad, this, method, has, many, benefits, including, easier, and, more, exhaustive, visualization, of, products, the, ability, to, create, virtual, assemblies, of, parts, and, the, ease, of, use, in, designing, mating, interfaces, and, tolerances, other, cae, programs, commonly, used, by, mechanical, engineers, include, product, lifecycle, management, plm, tools, and, analysis, tools, used, to, perform, complex, simulations, analysis, tools, may, be, used, to, predict, product, response, to, expected, loads, including, fatigue, life, and, manufacturability, these, tools, include, finite, element, analysis, fea, computational, fluid, dynamics, cfd, and, computer, aided, manufacturing, cam, using, cae, programs, a, mechanical, design, team, can, quickly, and, cheaply, iterate, the, design, process, to, develop, a, product, that, better, meets, cost, performance, and, other, constraints, no, physical, prototype, need, be, created, until, the, design, nears, completion,
