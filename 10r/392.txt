an, axe, k, s, sometimes, ax, in, american, english, see, spelling, differences, is, an, implement, that, has, been, used, for, millennia, to, shape, split, and, cut, wood, to, harvest, timber, as, a, weapon, and, as, a, ceremonial, or, heraldic, symbol, the, axe, has, many, forms, and, specialised, uses, but, generally, consists, of, an, axe, head, with, a, handle, also, called, a, haft, or, a, helve, before, the, modern, axe, the, stone, age, hand, axe, without, a, handle, was, used, from, 1, 5, million, years, bp, hafted, axes, those, with, a, handle, date, only, from, 6, 000, bc, the, earliest, examples, of, handled, axes, have, heads, of, stone, with, some, form, of, wooden, handle, attached, hafted, in, a, method, to, suit, the, available, materials, and, use, axes, made, of, copper, bronze, iron, and, steel, appeared, as, these, technologies, developed, the, axe, is, an, example, of, a, simple, machine, as, it, is, a, type, of, wedge, or, dual, inclined, plane, this, reduces, the, effort, needed, by, the, wood, chopper, it, splits, the, wood, into, two, parts, by, the, pressure, concentration, at, the, blade, the, handle, of, the, axe, also, acts, as, a, lever, allowing, the, user, to, increase, the, force, at, the, cutting, edge, not, using, the, full, length, of, the, handle, is, known, as, choking, the, axe, for, fine, chopping, using, a, side, axe, this, sometimes, is, a, positive, effect, but, for, felling, with, a, double, bitted, axe, it, reduces, efficiency, generally, cutting, axes, have, a, shallow, wedge, angle, whereas, splitting, axes, have, a, deeper, angle, most, axes, are, double, bevelled, i, e, symmetrical, about, the, axis, of, the, blade, but, some, specialist, broadaxes, have, a, single, bevel, blade, and, usually, an, offset, handle, that, allows, them, to, be, used, for, finishing, work, without, putting, the, user, s, knuckles, at, risk, of, injury, less, common, today, they, were, once, an, integral, part, of, a, joiner, and, carpenter, s, tool, kit, not, just, a, tool, for, use, in, forestry, a, tool, of, similar, origin, is, the, billhook, most, modern, axes, have, steel, heads, and, wooden, handles, typically, hickory, in, the, us, and, ash, in, europe, and, asia, although, plastic, or, fibreglass, handles, are, also, common, modern, axes, are, specialised, by, use, size, and, form, hafted, axes, with, short, handles, designed, for, use, with, one, hand, are, often, called, hand, axes, but, the, term, hand, axe, refers, to, axes, without, handles, as, well, hatchets, tend, to, be, small, hafted, axes, often, with, a, hammer, on, the, back, side, the, poll, as, easy, to, make, weapons, axes, have, frequently, been, used, in, combat, and, is, one, of, humanity, s, oldest, melee, weapons, hand, axes, of, stone, and, used, without, handles, hafts, were, the, first, axes, they, had, knapped, chipped, cutting, edges, of, flint, or, other, stone, early, examples, of, hand, axes, date, back, to, 1, 6, mya, in, the, later, oldowan, in, southern, ethiopia, around, 1, 4, mya, and, in, 1, 2, mya, deposits, in, olduvai, gorge, stone, axes, made, with, ground, cutting, edges, were, first, developed, sometime, in, the, late, pleistocene, in, australia, where, grind, edge, axe, fragments, from, sites, in, arnhem, land, date, back, at, least, 44, 000, years, grind, edge, axes, were, later, present, in, japan, some, time, around, 38, 000, bp, and, are, known, from, several, upper, palaeolithic, sites, on, the, islands, of, honshu, and, kyushu, hafted, axes, are, first, known, from, the, mesolithic, period, c, 6000, bc, few, wooden, hafts, have, been, found, from, this, period, but, it, seems, that, the, axe, was, normally, hafted, by, wedging, birch, tar, and, rawhide, lashings, were, used, to, fix, the, blade, the, distribution, of, stone, axes, is, an, important, indication, of, prehistoric, trade, thin, sectioning, is, used, to, determine, the, provenance, of, the, stone, blades, in, europe, neolithic, axe, factories, where, thousands, of, ground, stone, axes, were, roughed, out, are, known, from, many, places, such, as, metal, axes, are, still, produced, and, in, use, today, in, parts, of, papua, indonesia, the, mount, hagen, area, of, papua, new, guinea, was, an, important, production, centre, from, the, late, neolithic, chalcolithic, onwards, axes, were, made, of, copper, or, copper, mixed, with, arsenic, these, axes, were, flat, and, hafted, much, like, their, stone, predecessors, axes, continued, to, be, made, in, this, manner, with, the, introduction, of, bronze, metallurgy, eventually, the, hafting, method, changed, and, the, flat, axe, developed, into, the, flanged, axe, then, palstaves, and, later, winged, and, socketed, axes, at, least, since, the, late, neolithic, elaborate, axes, battle, axes, t, axes, etc, had, a, religious, significance, and, probably, indicated, the, exalted, status, of, their, owner, certain, types, almost, never, show, traces, of, wear, deposits, of, unshafted, axe, blades, from, the, middle, neolithic, such, as, at, the, somerset, levels, in, britain, may, have, been, gifts, to, the, deities, in, minoan, crete, the, double, axe, labrys, had, a, special, significance, used, by, priestesses, in, religious, ceremonies, in, 1998, a, labrys, complete, with, an,

cm, 6, 9, in, long, and, made, of, antigorite, mined, in, the, gotthard, area, the, haft, goes, through, a, biconical, drilled, hole, and, is, fastened, by, wedges, of, antler, and, by, birch, tar,

the, eternal, king, of, norway, in, folklore, stone, axes, were, sometimes, believed, to, be, thunderbolts, and, were, used, to, guard, buildings, against, lightning, as, it, was, believed, mythically, that, lightning, never, struck, the, same, place, twice, this, has, caused, some, skewing, of, axe, distributions, steel, axes, were, important, in, superstition, as, well, a, thrown, axe,

under, the, sill, of, a, house, would, keep, off, witches, while, an, axe, under, the, bed, would, assure, male, offspring, basques, australians, and, new, zealanders, have, developed, variants, of,

axe, head, is, typically, bounded, by, the, bit, or, blade, at, one, end, and, the, poll, or, butt, at, the, other, though, some, designs, feature, two, bits, opposite, each, other, the, top, corner, of, the, bit, where, the, cutting, edge, begins, is, called, the, toe, and, the, bottom, corner, is, known, as, the, heel, either, side, of, the, head, is, called, the, cheek, which, is, sometimes, supplemented, by, lugs, where, the, head, meets, the, haft, and, the, hole, where, the, haft, is, mounted, is, called, the, eye, the, part, of, the, bit, that, descends, below, the, rest, of, the, axe, head, is, called, the, beard, and, a, bearded, axe, is, an, antiquated, axe, head, with, an, exaggerated, beard, that, can, sometimes, extend, the, cutting, edge, twice, the, height, of, the,

have, hafts, made, of, durable, synthetic, materials, antique, axes, and, their, modern, reproductions, like, the, tomahawk, often, had, a, simple, straight, haft, with, a, circular, cross, section, that, wedged, onto, the, axe, head, without, the, aid, of, wedges, or, pins, modern, hafts, are, curved, for, better, grip, and, to, aid, in, the, swinging, motion, and, are, mounted, securely, to, the, head, the, shoulder, is, where, the, head, mounts, onto, the, haft, and, this, is, either, a, long, oval, or, rectangular, cross, section, of, the, haft, that, is, secured, to, the, axe, head, with, small, metal, or, wooden, wedges, the, belly, of, the, haft, is, the, longest, part, where, it, bows, in, gently, and, the, throat, is, where, it, curves, sharply, down, to, the, short, grip, just, before, the, end, of, the, haft, which, is, known, as, the, knob, hammer, axes, or, axe, hammers, typically, feature, an, extended, poll, opposite, the, blade, shaped, and, sometimes, hardened, for, use, as, a, hammer, the, name, axe, hammer, is, often, applied, to, a, characteristic, shape, of, perforated, stone, axe, used, in, the, neolithic, and, bronze, ages, iron, axe, hammers, are,
