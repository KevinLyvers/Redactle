a, tire, british, spelling, tyre, is, a, ring, shaped, component, that, surrounds, a, wheel, s, rim, to, transfer, a, vehicle, s, load, from, the, axle, through, the, wheel, to, the, ground, and, to, provide, traction, on, the, surface, over, which, the, wheel, travels, most, tires, such, as, those, for, automobiles, and, bicycles, are, pneumatically, inflated, structures, providing, a, flexible, cushion, that, absorbs, shock, as, the, tire, rolls, over, rough, features, on, the, surface, tires, provide, a, footprint, called, a, contact, patch, designed, to, match, the, vehicle, s, weight, and, the, bearing, on, the, surface, that, it, rolls, over, by, exerting, a, pressure, that, will, avoid, deforming, the, surface, the, materials, of, modern, pneumatic, tires, are, synthetic, rubber, natural, rubber, fabric, and, wire, along, with, carbon, black, and, other, chemical, compounds, they, consist, of, a, tread, and, a, body, the, tread, provides, traction, while, the, body, provides, containment, for, a, quantity, of, compressed, air, before, rubber, was, developed, tires, were, metal, bands, fitted, around, wooden, wheels, to, hold, the, wheel, together, under, load, and, to, prevent, wear, and, tear, early, rubber, tires, were, solid, not, pneumatic, pneumatic, tires, are, used, on, many, vehicles, including, cars, bicycles, motorcycles, buses, trucks, heavy, equipment, and, aircraft, metal, tires, are, used, on, locomotives, and, railcars, and, solid, rubber, or, other, polymers, tires, are, also, used, in, various, non, automotive, applications, such, as, casters, carts, lawnmowers, and, wheelbarrows, unmaintained, tires, can, lead, to, severe, hazards, for, vehicles, and, people, ranging, from, flat, tires, making, the, vehicle, inoperable, to, blowouts, where, tires, explode, during, operation, and, possibly, damage, vehicles, and, injure, people, the, manufacture, of, tires, is, often, highly, regulated, for, this, reason, because, of, the, widespread, use, of, tires, for, motor, vehicles, tire, waste, is, a, substantial, portion, of, global, waste, there, is, a, need, for, tire, recycling, through, mechanical, recycling, and, reuse, such, as, for, crumb, rubber, and, other, tire, derived, aggregate, and, pyrolysis, for, chemical, reuse, such, as, for, tire, derived, fuel, if, not, recycled, properly, or, burned, waste, tires, release, toxic, chemicals, into, the, environment, moreover, the, regular, use, of, tires, produces, micro, plastic, particles, that, contain, these, chemicals, that, both, enter, the, environment, and, affect, human, health, the, word, tire, is, a, short, form, of, attire, from, the, idea, that, a, wheel, with, a, tire, is, a, dressed, wheel, tyre, is, the, oldest, spelling, and, both, tyre, and, tire, were, used, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, tire, became, more, common, in, print, the, spelling, tyre, did, not, reappear, until, the, 1840s, when, the, english, began, shrink, fitting, railway, car, wheels, with, malleable, iron, nevertheless, many, publishers, continued, using, tire, the, times, newspaper, in, london, was, still, using, tire, as, late, as, 1905, the, spelling, tyre, began, to, be, commonly, used, in, the, 19th, century, for, pneumatic, tires, in, the, uk, the, 1911, edition, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, states, that, the, spelling, tyre, is, not, now, accepted, by, the, best, english, authorities, and, is, unrecognized, in, the, us, while, fowler, s, modern, english, usage, of, 1926, describes, that, there, is, nothing, to, be, said, for, tyre, which, is, etymologically, wrong, as, well, as, needlessly, divergent, from, our, own, older, the, present, american, usage, however, over, the, 20th, century, tyre, became, established, as, the, standard, british, spelling, the, earliest, tires, were, bands, of, leather, then, iron, later, steel, placed, on, wooden, wheels, used, on, carts, and, wagons, a, skilled, worker, known, as, a, wheelwright, would, cause, the, tire, to, expand, by, heating, it, in, a, forge, fire, placing, it, over, the, wheel, and, quenching, it, causing, the, metal, to, contract, back, to, its, original, size, to, fit, tightly, on, the, wheel, the, first, patent, for, what, appears, to, be, a, standard, pneumatic, tire, appeared, in, 1847, and, was, lodged, by, scottish, inventor, robert, william, thomson, however, this, idea, never, went, into, production, the, first, practical, pneumatic, tire, was, made, in, 1888, on, may, street, belfast, by, scots, born, john, boyd, dunlop, owner, of, one, of, ireland, s, most, prosperous, veterinary, practices, it, was, an, effort, to, prevent, the, headaches, of, his, 10, year, old, son, johnnie, while, riding, his, tricycle, on, rough, pavements, his, doctor, john, later, sir, john, fagan, had, prescribed, cycling, as, an, exercise, for, the, boy, and, was, a, regular, visitor, fagan, participated, in, designing, the, first, pneumatic, tires, cyclist, willie, hume, demonstrated, the, supremacy, of, dunlop, s, tires, in, 1889, winning, the, tire, s, first, ever, races, in, ireland, and, then, england, in, dunlop, s, tire, patent, specification, dated, 31, october, 1888, his, interest, is, only, in, its, use, in, cycles, and, light, vehicles, in, september, 1890, he, was, made, aware, of, an, earlier, development, but, the, company, kept, the, information, to, itself, in, 1892, dunlop, s, patent, was, declared, invalid, because, of, the, prior, art, by, forgotten, fellow, scot, robert, william, thomson, of, london, patents, london, 1845, france, 1846, usa, 1847, however, dunlop, is, credited, with, realizing, rubber, could, withstand, the, wear, and, tear, of, being, a, tire, while, retaining, its, resilience, john, boyd, dunlop, and, harvey, du, cros, worked, through, the, ensuing, considerable, difficulties, they, employed, inventor, charles, kingston, welch, and, acquired, other, rights, and, patents, which, allowed, them, some, limited, protection, of, their, pneumatic, tyre, business, s, position, pneumatic, tyre, would, become, dunlop, rubber, and, dunlop, tyres, the, development, of, this, technology, hinged, on, myriad, engineering, advances, including, the, vulcanization, of, natural, rubber, using, sulfur, as, well, as, the, development, of, the, clincher, rim, for, holding, the, tire, in, place, laterally, on, the, wheel, rim, synthetic, rubbers, were, invented, in, the, laboratories, of, bayer, in, the, 1920s, rubber, shortages, in, the, united, kingdom, during, wwii, prompted, research, on, alternatives, to, rubber, tires, with, suggestions, including, leather, compressed, asbestos, rayon, felt, bristles, and, paper, in, 1946, michelin, developed, the, radial, tire, method, of, construction, michelin, had, bought, the, bankrupt, citro, n, automobile, company, in, 1934, to, utilize, this, new, technology, because, of, its, superiority, in, handling, and, fuel, economy, use, of, this, technology, quickly, spread, throughout, europe, and, asia, in, the, us, the, outdated, bias, ply, tire, construction, persisted, until, the, ford, motor, company, adopted, radial, tires, in, the, early, 1970s, following, a, 1968, article, in, an, influential, american, magazine, consumer, reports, highlighting, the, superiority, of, radial, construction, the, us, tire, industry, lost, its, market, share, to, japanese, and, european, manufacturers, which, bought, out, us, companies, tires, may, be, classified, according, to, the, type, of, vehicle, they, serve, they, may, be, distinguished, by, the, load, they, carry, and, by, their, application, e, g, to, a, motor, vehicle, aircraft, or, bicycle, light, duty, tires, for, passenger, vehicles, carry, loads, in, the, range, of, 550, to, 1, 100, pounds, 250, to, 500, kg, on, the, drive, wheel, light, to, medium, duty, trucks, and, vans, carry, loads, in, the, range, of, 1, 100, to, 3, 300, pounds, 500, to, 1, 500, kg, on, the, drive, wheel, they, are, differentiated, by, speed, rating, for, different, vehicles, including, starting, from, the, lowest, speed, to, the, highest, winter, tires, light, truck, tires, entry, level, car, tires, sedans, and, vans, sport, sedans, and, high, performance, cars, apart, from, road, tires, there, are, special, categories, other, types, of, light, duty, automotive, tires, include, run, flat, tires, and, race, car, tires, heavy, duty, tires, for, large, trucks, and, buses, come, in, a, variety, of, profiles, and, carry, loads, in, the, range, of, 4, 000, to, 5, 500, pounds, 1, 800, to, 2, 500, kg, on, the, drive, wheel, these, are, typically, mounted, in, tandem, on, the, drive, axle, aircraft, bicycles, and, a, variety, of, industrial, applications, have, distinct, design, requirements, tire, construction, spans, pneumatic, tires, used, on, cars, trucks, and, aircraft, but, also, includes, non, automotive, applications, with, slow, moving, light, duty, or, railroad, applications, which, may, have, non, pneumatic, tires, following, the, 1968, consumer, reports, announcement, of, the, superiority, of, the, radial, design, radial, tires, began, an, inexorable, climb, in, market, share, reaching, 100, of, the, north, american, market, in, the, 1980s, radial, tire, technology, is, now, the, standard, design, for, essentially, all, automotive, tires, but, other, methods, have, been, used, radial, tire, construction, utilizes, body, ply, cords, extending, from, the, beads, and, across, the, tread, so, that, the, cords, are, laid, at, approximately, right, angles, to, the, centerline, of, the, tread, and, parallel, to, each, other, as, well, as, stabilizer, belts, directly, beneath, the, tread, the, belts, may, be, cord, or, steel, the, advantages, of, this, construction, include, longer, tread, life, better, steering, control, fewer, blowouts, improved, fuel, economy, and, lower, rolling, resistance, disadvantages, of, the, radial, tire, are, a, harder, ride, at, low, speeds, on, rough, roads, and, in, the, context, of, off, roading, decreased, self, cleaning, ability, and, lower, grip, ability, at, low, speeds, bias, tire, or, cross, ply, construction, utilizes, body, ply, cords, that, extend, diagonally, from, bead, to, bead, usually, at, angles, in, the, range, of, 30, to, 40, degrees, successive, plies, are, laid, at, opposing, angles, forming, a, crisscross, pattern, to, which, the, tread, is, applied, the, design, allows, the, entire, tire, body, to, flex, easily, providing, the, main, advantage, of, this, construction, a, smooth, ride, on, rough, surfaces, this, cushioning, characteristic, also, causes, the, major, disadvantages, of, a, bias, tire, increased, rolling, resistance, and, less, control, and, traction, at, higher, speeds, a, belted, bias, tire, starts, with, two, or, more, bias, plies, to, which, stabilizer, belts, are, bonded, directly, beneath, the, tread, this, construction, provides, a, smoother, ride, that, is, similar, to, the, bias, tire, while, lessening, rolling, resistance, because, the, belts, increase, tread, stiffness, the, design, was, introduced, by, armstrong, while, goodyear, made, it, popular, with, the, polyglas, trademark, tire, featuring, a, polyester, carcass, with, belts, of, fiberglass, the, belted, tire, starts, two, main, plies, of, polyester, rayon, or, nylon, annealed, as, in, conventional, tires, and, then, placed, on, top, are, circumferential, belts, at, different, angles, that, improve, performance, compared, to, non, belted, bias, tires, the, belts, may, be, fiberglass, or, steel, tubeless, tires, are, pneumatic, tires, that, do, not, require, a, separate, inner, tube, semi, pneumatic, tires, have, a, hollow, center, but, they, are, not, pressurized, they, are, lightweight, low, cost, puncture, proof, and, provide, cushioning, these, tires, often, come, as, a, complete, assembly, with, the, wheel, and, even, integral, ball, bearings, they, are, used, on, lawn, mowers, wheelchairs, and, wheelbarrows, they, can, also, be, rugged, typically, used, in, industrial, applications, and, are, designed, to, not, pull, off, their, rim, under, use, an, airless, tire, is, a, non, pneumatic, tire, that, is, not, supported, by, air, pressure, they, are, most, commonly, used, on, small, vehicles, such, as, golf, carts, and, on, utility, vehicles, in, situations, where, the, risk, of, puncture, is, high, such, as, on, construction, equipment, many, tires, used, in, industrial, and, commercial, applications, are, non, pneumatic, and, are, manufactured, from, solid, rubber, and, plastic, compounds, via, molding, operations, solid, tires, include, those, used, for, lawnmowers, skateboards, golf, carts, scooters, and, many, types, of, light, industrial, vehicles, carts, and, trailers, one, of, the, most, common, applications, for, solid, tires, is, for, material, handling, equipment, forklifts, such, tires, are, installed, utilizing, a, hydraulic, tire, press, wooden, wheels, for, horse, drawn, vehicles, usually, have, a, wrought, iron, tire, this, construction, was, extended, to, wagons, on, horse, drawn, tramways, rolling, on, granite, setts, or, cast, iron, rails, the, wheels, of, some, railway, engines, and, older, types, of, rolling, stock, are, fitted, with, railway, tires, to, prevent, the, need, to, replace, the, entirety, of, a, wheel, the, tire, usually, made, of, steel, surrounds, the, wheel, and, is, primarily, held, in, place, by, interference, fit, aircraft, tires, may, operate, at, pressures, that, exceed, 200, pounds, per, square, inch, 14, bar, 1, 400, kpa, some, aircraft, tires, are, inflated, with, nitrogen, to, eliminate, the, possibility, of, a, chemical, reaction, between, atmospheric, oxygen, and, volatile, gases, from, the, tire, inner, liner, producing, a, tire, explosion, pneumatic, tires, are, manufactured, in, about, 450, tire, factories, around, the, world, tire, production, starts, with, bulk, raw, materials, such, as, rubber, carbon, black, and, chemicals, and, produces, numerous, specialized, components, that, are, assembled, and, cured, many, kinds, of, rubber, are, used, the, most, common, being, styrene, butadiene, copolymer, forecasts, for, the, global, automotive, tire, market, indicate, continued, growth, through, 2027, estimates, put, the, value, of, worldwide, sales, volume, around, 126, billion, in, 2022, it, is, expected, to, reach, the, value, of, over, 176, billion, by, 2027, production, of, tires, is, also, experiencing, growth, in, 2015, the, us, manufactured, almost, 170, million, tires, over, 2, 5, billion, tires, are, manufactured, annually, making, the, tire, industry, a, major, consumer, of, natural, rubber, it, is, estimated, that, by, 2019, 3, billion, tires, will, be, to, be, sold, globally, every, year, estimates, put, worldwide, tire, production, of, 2, 268, million, in, 2021, and, is, predicted, to, reach, 2, 665, million, tires, by, 2027, as, of, 2011, the, top, three, tire, manufacturing, companies, by, revenue, were, bridgestone, manufacturing, 190, million, tires, michelin, 184, million, goodyear, 181, million, they, were, followed, by, continental, and, pirelli, the, lego, group, produced, over, 318, million, toy, tires, in, 2011, and, was, recognized, by, guinness, world, records, as, having, the, highest, annual, production, of, tires, by, any, manufacturer, a, tire, comprises, several, components, the, tread, bead, sidewall, shoulder, and, ply, the, tread, is, the, part, of, the, tire, that, comes, in, contact, with, the, road, surface, the, portion, that, is, in, contact, with, the, road, at, a, given, instant, in, time, is, the, contact, patch, the, tread, is, a, thick, rubber, or, rubber, composite, compound, formulated, to, provide, an, appropriate, level, of, traction, that, does, not, wear, away, too, quickly, the, tread, pattern, is, characterized, by, a, system, of, circumferential, grooves, lateral, sipes, and, slots, for, road, tires, or, a, system, of, lugs, and, voids, for, tires, designed, for, soft, terrain, or, snow, grooves, run, circumferentially, around, the, tire, and, are, needed, to, channel, away, water, lugs, are, that, portion, of, the, tread, design, that, contacts, the, road, surface, grooves, sipes, and, slots, allow, tires, to, evacuate, water, the, design, of, treads, and, the, interaction, of, specific, tire, types, with, the, roadway, surface, affects, roadway, noise, a, source, of, noise, pollution, emanating, from, moving, vehicles, these, sound, intensities, increase, with, higher, vehicle, speeds, tires, treads, may, incorporate, a, variety, of, distances, between, slots, pitch, lengths, to, minimize, noise, levels, at, discrete, frequencies, sipes, are, slits, cut, across, the, tire, usually, perpendicular, to, the, grooves, which, allow, the, water, from, the, grooves, to, escape, sideways, and, mitigate, hydroplaning, different, tread, designs, address, a, variety, of, driving, conditions, as, the, ratio, of, tire, tread, area, to, groove, area, increases, so, does, tire, friction, on, dry, pavement, as, seen, on, formula, one, tires, some, of, which, have, no, grooves, high, performance, tires, often, have, smaller, void, areas, to, provide, more, rubber, in, contact, with, the, road, for, higher, traction, but, may, be, compounded, with, softer, rubber, that, provides, better, traction, but, wears, quickly, mud, and, snow, m, s, tires, employ, larger, and, deeper, slots, to, engage, mud, and, snow, snow, tires, have, still, larger, and, deeper, slots, that, compact, snow, and, create, shear, strength, within, the, compacted, snow, to, improve, braking, and, cornering, performance, wear, bars, or, wear, indicators, are, raised, features, located, at, the, bottom, of, the, tread, grooves, that, indicate, the, tire, has, reached, its, wear, limit, when, the, tread, lugs, are, worn, to, the, point, that, the, wear, bars, connect, across, the, lugs, the, tires, are, fully, worn, and, should, be, taken, out, of, service, typically, at, a, remaining, tread, depth, of, 1, 6, millimetres, 0, 063, in, the, tire, bead, is, the, part, of, the, tire, that, contacts, the, rim, on, the, wheel, this, essential, component, is, constructed, with, robust, steel, cables, encased, in, durable, specially, formulated, rubber, designed, to, resist, stretching, the, precision, of, the, bead, s, fit, is, crucial, as, it, seals, the, tire, against, the, wheel, maintaining, air, pressure, integrity, and, preventing, any, loss, of, air, the, bead, s, design, ensures, a, secure, non, slip, connection, preventing, the, tire, from, rotating, independently, from, the, wheel, during, vehicle, motion, additionally, the, interplay, between, the, bead, s, dimensions, and, the, wheel, s, width, significantly, influences, the, vehicle, s, steering, responsiveness, and, stability, as, it, helps, to, maintain, the, tire, s, intended, shape, and, contact, with, the, road, the, sidewall, is, that, part, of, the, tire, or, bicycle, tire, that, bridges, between, the, tread, and, bead, the, sidewall, is, largely, rubber, but, reinforced, with, fabric, or, steel, cords, that, provide, for, tensile, strength, and, flexibility, the, sidewall, contains, air, pressure, and, transmits, the, torque, applied, by, the, drive, axle, to, the, tread, to, create, traction, but, supports, little, of, the, weight, of, the, vehicle, as, is, clear, from, the, total, collapse, of, the, tire, when, punctured, sidewalls, are, molded, with, manufacturer, specific, detail, government, mandated, warning, labels, and, other, consumer, information, sidewall, may, also, have, sometimes, decorative, ornamentation, that, includes, whitewall, or, red, line, inserts, as, well, as, tire, lettering, the, shoulder, is, that, part, of, the, tire, at, the, edge, of, the, tread, as, it, makes, the, transition, to, the, sidewall, plies, are, layers, of, relatively, inextensible, cords, embedded, in, the, rubber, to, hold, its, shape, by, preventing, the, rubber, from, stretching, in, response, to, the, internal, pressure, the, orientations, of, the, plies, play, a, large, role, in, the, performance, of, the, tire, and, are, one, of, the, main, ways, that, tires, are, categorized, blem, short, for, blemished, is, a, term, used, for, a, tire, that, failed, inspection, during, manufacturing, but, only, for, superficial, cosmetic, aesthetic, reasons, for, example, a, tire, with, white, painted, lettering, which, is, smudged, or, incomplete, might, be, classified, as, a, blem, blem, tires, are, fully, functional, and, generally, carry, the, same, warranty, as, flawless, tires, but, are, sold, at, a, discount, the, materials, of, modern, pneumatic, tires, can, be, divided, into, two, groups, the, cords, that, make, up, the, ply, and, the, elastomer, which, encases, them, the, cords, which, form, the, ply, and, bead, and, provide, the, tensile, strength, necessary, to, contain, the, inflation, pressure, can, be, composed, of, steel, natural, fibers, such, as, cotton, or, silk, or, synthetic, fibers, such, as, nylon, or, kevlar, good, adhesion, between, the, cords, and, the, rubber, is, important, to, achieve, this, the, steel, cords, are, coated, in, a, thin, layer, of, brass, various, additives, will, also, be, added, to, the, rubber, to, improve, binding, such, as, resorcinol, hmmm, mixtures, the, elastomer, which, forms, the, tread, and, encases, the, cords, to, protect, them, from, abrasion, and, hold, them, in, place, is, a, key, component, of, pneumatic, tire, design, it, can, be, composed, of, various, composites, of, rubber, material, the, most, common, being, styrene, butadiene, copolymer, with, other, chemical, compounds, such, as, silica, and, carbon, black, optimizing, rolling, resistance, in, the, elastomer, material, is, a, key, challenge, for, reducing, fuel, consumption, in, the, transportation, sector, it, is, estimated, that, passenger, vehicles, consume, approximately, 5, 15, of, their, fuel, to, overcome, rolling, resistance, while, the, estimate, is, understood, to, be, higher, for, heavy, trucks, however, there, is, a, trade, off, between, rolling, resistance, and, wet, traction, and, grip, while, low, rolling, resistance, can, be, achieved, by, reducing, the, viscoelastic, properties, of, the, rubber, compound, low, tangent, it, comes, at, the, cost, of, wet, traction, and, grip, which, requires, hysteresis, and, energy, dissipation, high, tangent, a, low, tangent, value, at, 60, c, is, used, as, an, indicator, of, low, rolling, resistance, while, a, high, tangent, value, at, 0, c, is, used, as, an, indicator, of, high, wet, traction, designing, an, elastomer, material, that, can, achieve, both, high, wet, traction, and, low, rolling, resistance, is, key, in, achieving, safety, and, fuel, efficiency, in, the, transportation, sector, the, most, common, elastomer, material, used, today, is, a, styrene, butadiene, copolymer, it, combines, the, properties, of, polybutadiene, which, is, a, highly, rubbery, polymer, tg, 100, c, having, high, hysteresis, and, thus, offering, good, wet, grip, properties, with, the, properties, of, polystyrene, which, is, a, glassy, polymer, tg, 100, c, having, low, hysteresis, and, thus, offering, low, rolling, resistance, in, addition, to, wear, resistance, therefore, the, ratio, of, the, two, monomers, in, the, styrene, butadiene, copolymer, is, considered, key, in, determining, the, glass, transition, temperature, of, the, material, which, is, correlated, to, its, grip, and, resistance, properties, non, exhaust, emissions, of, particulate, matter, generated, by, the, wearing, down, of, brakes, clutches, tires, and, road, surfaces, as, well, as, by, the, suspension, of, road, dust, constitute, a, little, known, but, rising, share, of, emissions, from, road, traffic, and, significantly, harm, public, health, associated, components, of, tires, include, the, wheel, on, which, it, is, mounted, the, valve, stem, through, which, air, is, introduced, and, for, some, tires, an, inner, tube, that, provides, the, airtight, means, for, maintaining, tire, pressure, the, interactions, of, a, tire, with, the, pavement, are, complex, a, commonly, used, empirical, model, of, tire, properties, is, pacejka, s, magic, formula, some, are, explained, below, alphabetically, by, section, tire, wear, is, a, major, source, of, rubber, pollution, a, concern, hereby, is, that, vehicle, tire, wear, pollution, is, unregulated, unlike, exhaust, emissions, automotive, tires, have, a, variety, of, identifying, markings, molded, onto, the, sidewall, as, a, tire, code, they, denote, size, rating, and, other, information, pertinent, to, that, individual, tire, the, national, highway, and, traffic, safety, administration, nhtsa, is, a, u, s, government, body, within, the, department, of, transportation,

tires, according, to, the, code, of, federal, regulations, 49, cfr, 575, 104, it, requires, labeling, of, tires, for, tread, wear, traction, and, temperature, the, dot, code, is, an, alphanumeric, character, sequence, molded, into, the, sidewall, of, the, tire, and, allows, the, identification, of, the, tire, and, its, age, the, code, is, mandated, by, the, u, s, department, of, transportation, but, is, used, worldwide, the, dot, code, is, also, useful, in, identifying, tires, subject, to, product, recall, or, at, end, of, life, due, to, age, the, tire, and, rim, association, t, ra, is, a,

rolling, resistance, of, pneumatic, tires, many, vehicles, have, monitoring, systems, to, assure, proper, inflation, most, passenger, cars, are, advised, to, maintain, a, tire, pressure, within, the, range, of, 32, to, 35, pounds, per, square, inch, 220, to, 240, kpa, when, the, tires, are, not, warmed, by, driving, tire, hazards, may, occur, from, failure, of, the, tire, itself, or, from, loss, of, traction, on, the, surface, over, which, it, is, rolling, structural, failures, of, a, tire, can, result, in, flat, tires, or, more, dangerous, blowouts, some, of, these, failures, can, be, caused, by, manufacture, error, and, may, lead, to, recalls, such, as, the, widespread, firestone, tire, failures, on, ford, vehicles, that, lead, to, the, firestone, and, ford, tire, controversy, in, the, 1990s, tires, may, fail, for, any, of, a, variety, of, reasons, including, tires, contain, a, number, of, trace, toxic, chemicals, including, heavy, metals, and, chemical, agents, used, to, increase, the, durability, of, the, tires, these, typically, include, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbon, benzothiazoles, isoprene, and, heavy, metals, such, as, zinc, and, lead, as, tires, are, used, for, vehicle, operations, the, natural, wear, of, the, tire, leaves, microfine, particles, equivalent, to, pm0, 1, pm2, 5, and, pm10, as, tire, residue, this, residue, accumulates, near, roadways, and, vehicle, use, areas, but, also, will, travel, into, the, environment, through, surface, runoff, both, humans, and, animals, are, exposed, to, these, chemicals, at, the, site, of, accumulation, i, e, walking, on, the, road, surface, and, through, the, accumulation, in, natural, environments, and, foodchains, a, 2023, literature, review, from, imperial, college, london, warned, of, both, the, toxic, chemicals, and, microplastics, produced, from, tire, wear, as, having, potential, widespread, serious, environmental, and, health, consequences, moreover, burning, of, tires, releases, these, chemicals, as, air, pollutants, as, well, as, leaving, toxic, residues, that, can, have, significant, effects, on, local, communities, and, first, responders, once, tires, are, discarded, they, are, considered, scrap, tires, scrap, tires, are, often, re, used, for, things, from, bumper, car, barriers, to, weights, to, hold, down, tarps, tires, are, not, desired, at, landfills, due, to, their, large, volumes, and, 75, void, space, which, quickly, consumes, valuable, space, rubber, tires, are, likely, to, contain, some, traces, of, heavy, metals, or, other, serious, pollutants, but, these, are, tightly, bonded, within, the, actual, rubber, compound, so, they, are, unlikely, to, be, hazardous, unless, the, tire, structure, is, seriously, damaged, by, fire, or, strong, chemicals, some, facilities, are, permitted, to, recycle, scrap, tires, by, chipping, and, processing, them, into, new, products, or, selling, the, material, to, licensed, power, plants, for, fuel, some, tires, may, also, be, retreaded, for, re, use, americans, generate, about, 285, million, scrap, tires, per, year, many, states, have, regulations, as, to, the, number, of, scrap, tires, that, can, be, held, on, site, due, to, concerns, with, dumping, fire, hazards, and, mosquitoes, in, the, past, millions, of, tires, have, been, discarded, into, open, fields, this, creates, a, breeding, ground, for, mosquitoes, since, the, tires, often, hold, water, inside, and, remain, warm, enough, for, mosquito, breeding, mosquitoes, create, a, nuisance, and, may, increase, the, likelihood, of, spreading, disease, it, also, creates, a, fire, danger, since, such, a, large, tire, pile, is, a, lot, of, fuel, some, tire, fires, have, burned, for, months, since, water, does, not, adequately, penetrate, or, cool, the, burning, tires, tires, have, been, known, to, liquefy, releasing, hydrocarbons, and, other, contaminants, to, the, ground, and, even, groundwater, under, extreme, heat, and, temperatures, from, a, fire, the, black, smoke, from, a, tire, fire, causes, air, pollution, and, is, a, hazard, to, downwind, properties, the, use, of, scrap, tire, chips, for, landscaping, has, become, controversial, due, to, the, leaching, of, metals, and, other, contaminants, from, the, tire, pieces, zinc, is, concentrated, up, to, 2, by, weight, to, levels, high, enough, to, be, highly, toxic, to, aquatic, life, and, plants, of, particular, concern, is, evidence, that, some, of, the, compounds, that, leach, from, tires, into, the, water, contain, hormone, disruptors, and, cause, liver, lesions, tires, are, a, major, source, of, microplastic, pollution, tires, that, are, fully, worn, can, be, retreaded, re, manufactured, to, replace, the, worn, tread, this, is, known, as, retreading, or, recapping, a, process, of, buffing, away, the, worn, tread, and, applying, a, new, tread, there, are, two, main, processes, used, for, retreading, tires, called, mold, cure, and, pre, cure, methods, both, processes, start, with, the, inspection, of, the, tire, followed, by, non, destructive, inspection, method, such, as, shearography, to, locate, non, visible, damage, and, embedded, debris, and, nails, some, casings, are, repaired, and, some, are, discarded, tires, can, be, retreaded, multiple, times, if, the, casing, is, in, usable, condition, tires, used, for, short, delivery, vehicles, are, retreaded, more, than, long, haul, tires, over, the, life, of, the, tire, body, casings, fit, for, retreading, have, the, old, tread, buffed, away, to, prepare, for, retreading, during, the, retreading, process, retread, technicians, must, ensure, the, casing, is, in, the, best, condition, possible, to, minimize, the, possibility, of, a, casing, failure, casings, with, problems, such, as, capped, tread, tread, separation, irreparable, cuts, corroded, belts, or, sidewall, damage, or, any, run, flat, or, skidded, tires, will, be, rejected, the, mold, cure, method, involves, the, application, of, raw, rubber, on, the, previously, buffed, and, prepared, casing, which, is, later, cured, in, matrices, during, the, curing, period, vulcanization, takes, place, and, the, raw, rubber, bonds, to, the, casing, taking, the, tread, shape, of, the, matrix, on, the, other, hand, the, pre, cure, method, involves, the, application, of, a, ready, made, tread, band, on, the, buffed, and, prepared, casing, which, later, is, cured, in, an, autoclave, so, that, vulcanization, can, occur, tires, can, be, recycled, into, among, other, things, the, hot, melt, asphalt, typically, as, crumb, rubber, modifier, recycled, asphalt, pavement, crm, rap, and, as, an, aggregate, in, portland, cement, concrete, shredded, tires, can, create, rubber, mulch, on, playgrounds, to, diminish, fall, injuries, there, are, some, green, buildings, that, are, being, made, both, private, and, public, buildings, that, are, made, from, old, tires, the, tire, pyrolysis, method, for, recycling, used, tires, is, a, technique, that, heats, whole, or, shredded, tires, in, a, reactor, vessel, containing, an, oxygen, free, atmosphere, and, a, heat, source, in, the, reactor, the, rubber, is, softened, after, which, the, rubber, polymers, continuously, break, down, into, smaller, molecules, other, downstream, uses, have, been, developed, for, worn, out, tires, including
