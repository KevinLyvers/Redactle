agronomy, is, the, science, and, technology, of, producing, and, using, plants, by, agriculture, for, food, fuel, fiber, chemicals, recreation, or, land, conservation, agronomy, has, come, to, include, research, of, plant, genetics, plant, physiology, meteorology, and, soil, science, it, is, the, application, of, a, combination, of, sciences, such, as, biology, chemistry, economics, ecology, earth, science, and, genetics, professionals, of, agronomy, are, termed, agronomists, agronomy, has, a, long, and, rich, history, dating, to, the, neolithic, revolution, some, of, the, earliest, practices, of, agronomy, are, found, in, ancient, civilizations, including, ancient, egypt, mesopotamia, china, and, india, they, developed, various, techniques, for, the, management, of, soil, fertility, irrigation, and, crop, rotation, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, advances, in, science, led, to, the, development, of, modern, agronomy, german, chemist, justus, von, liebig, and, john, bennett, lawes, an, english, entrepreneur, contributed, to, the, understanding, of, plant, nutrition, and, soil, chemistry, their, work, laid, for, the, establishment, of, modern, fertilizers, and, agricultural, practices, agronomy, continued, to, evolve, with, the, development, of, new, technology, and, practices, in, the, 20th, century, from, the, 1960s, the, green, revolution, saw, the, introduction, of, high, yield, variety, of, crops, modern, fertilizers, and, improvement, of, agricultural, practices, it, led, to, an, increase, of, global, food, production, to, help, reduce, hunger, and, poverty, in, many, parts, of, the, world, this, topic, of, agronomy, involves, selective, breeding, of, plants, to, produce, the, best, crops, for, various, conditions, plant, breeding, has, increased, crop, yields, and, has, improved, the, nutritional, value, of, numerous, crops, including, corn, soybeans, and, wheat, it, has, also, resulted, in, the, development, of, new, types, of, plants, for, example, a, hybrid, grain, named, triticale, was, produced, by, crossbreeding, rye, and, wheat, triticale, contains, more, usable, protein, than, does, either, rye, or, wheat, agronomy, has, also, been, instrumental, for, fruit, and, vegetable, production, research, furthermore, the, application, of, plant, breeding, for, turfgrass, development, has, resulted, in, a, reduction, in, the, demand, for, fertilizer, and, water, inputs, requirements, as, well, as, turf, types, with, higher, disease, resistance, agronomists, use, biotechnology, to, extend, and, expedite, the, development, of, desired, characteristics, biotechnology, is, often, a, laboratory, activity, requiring, field, testing, of, new, crop, varieties, that, are, developed, in, addition, to, increasing, crop, yields, agronomic, biotechnology, is, being, applied, increasingly, for, novel, uses, other, than, food, for, example, oilseed, is, at, present, used, mainly, for, margarine, and, other, food, oils, but, it, can, be, modified, to, produce, fatty, acids, for, detergents, substitute, fuels, and, petrochemicals, agronomists, study, sustainable, ways, to, make, soils, more, productive, and, profitable, they, classify, soils, and, analyze, them, to, determine, whether, they, contain, nutrients, vital, for, plant, growth, common, macronutrients, analyzed, include, compounds, of, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and, sulfur, soil, is, also, assessed, for, several, micronutrients, like, zinc, and, boron, the, percentage, of, organic, matter, soil, ph, and, nutrient, holding, capacity, cation, exchange, capacity, are, tested, in, a, regional, laboratory, agronomists, will, interpret, these, laboratory, reports, and, make, recommendations, to, modify, soil, nutrients, for, optimal, plant, growth, additionally, agronomists, develop, methods, to, preserve, soil, and, decrease, the, effects, of, by, wind, and, water, for, example, a, technique, known, as, contour, plowing, may, be, used, to, prevent, soil, erosion, and, conserve, rainfall, researchers, of, agronomy, also, seek, ways, to, use, the, soil, more, effectively, for, solving, other, problems, such, problems, include, the, disposal, of, human, and, animal, manure, water, pollution, and, pesticide, accumulation, in, the, soil, as, well, as, preserving, the, soil, for, future, generations, such, as, the, burning, of, paddocks, after, crop, production, pasture, management, techniques, include, no, till, farming, planting, of, soil, binding, grasses, along, contours, on, steep, slopes, and, using, contour, drains, of, depths, as, much, as, 1, metre, agroecology, is, the, management, of, agricultural, systems, with, an, emphasis, on, ecological, and, environmental, applications, this, topic, is, associated, closely, with, work, for, sustainable, agriculture, organic, farming, and, alternative, food, systems, and, the, development, of, alternative, cropping, systems, theoretical, production, ecology, is, the, quantitative, study, of, the, growth, of, crops, the, plant, is, treated, as, a, kind, of, biological, factory, which, processes, light, carbon, dioxide, water, and, nutrients, into, harvestable, products, the, main, parameters, considered, are, temperature, sunlight, standing, crop, biomass, plant, production, distribution, and, nutrient, and, water, supply
