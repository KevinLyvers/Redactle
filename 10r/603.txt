space, exploration, is, the, use, of, astronomy, and, space, technology, to, explore, outer, space, while, the, exploration, of, space, is, currently, carried, out, mainly, by, astronomers, with, telescopes, its, physical, exploration, is, conducted, both, by, uncrewed, robotic, space, probes, and, human, spaceflight, space, exploration, like, its, classical, form, astronomy, is, one, of, the, main, sources, for, space, science, while, the, observation, of, objects, in, space, known, as, astronomy, predates, reliable, recorded, history, it, was, the, development, of, large, and, relatively, efficient, rockets, during, the, mid, twentieth, century, that, allowed, physical, space, exploration, to, become, a, reality, common, rationales, for, exploring, space, include, advancing, scientific, research, national, prestige, uniting, different, nations, ensuring, the, future, survival, of, humanity, and, developing, military, and, strategic, advantages, against, other, countries, the, early, era, of, space, exploration, was, driven, by, a, space, race, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, a, driving, force, of, the, start, of, space, exploration, was, during, the, cold, war, after, the, ability, to, create, nuclear, weapons, the, narrative, of, defense, offense, left, land, and, the, power, to, control, the, air, became, the, focus, both, the, soviet, and, the, u, s, were, fighting, to, prove, their, superiority, in, technology, through, exploring, the, unknown, space, in, fact, the, reason, nasa, was, made, was, due, to, the, response, of, sputnik, i, the, launch, of, the, first, human, made, object, to, orbit, earth, the, soviet, union, s, sputnik, 1, on, 4, october, 1957, and, the, first, moon, landing, by, the, american, apollo, 11, mission, on, 20, july, 1969, are, often, taken, as, landmarks, for, this, initial, period, the, soviet, space, program, achieved, many, of, the, first, milestones, including, the, first, living, being, in, orbit, in, 1957, the, first, human, spaceflight, yuri, gagarin, aboard, vostok, 1, in, 1961, the, first, spacewalk, by, alexei, leonov, on, 18, march, 1965, the, first, automatic, landing, on, another, celestial, body, in, 1966, and, the, launch, of, the, first, space, station, salyut, 1, in, 1971, after, the, first, 20, years, of, exploration, focus, shifted, from, one, off, flights, to, renewable, hardware, such, as, the, space, shuttle, program, and, from, competition, to, cooperation, as, with, the, international, space, station, iss, with, the, substantial, completion, of, the, iss, following, sts, 133, in, march, 2011, plans, for, space, exploration, by, the, u, s, remained, in, flux, the, constellation, program, aiming, for, a, return, to, the, moon, by, 2020, was, judged, unrealistic, by, an, expert, review, panel, reporting, in, 2009, constellation, ultimately, was, replaced, with, the, artemis, program, of, which, the, first, mission, occurred, in, 2022, with, a, planned, crewed, landing, to, occur, with, artemis, 3, the, rise, of, the, private, space, industry, also, began, in, earnest, in, the, 2010s, with, the, development, of, private, launch, vehicles, space, capsules, and, satellite, manufacturing, in, the, 2000s, china, initiated, a, successful, crewed, spaceflight, program, while, india, launched, the, chandrayaan, programme, while, the, european, union, and, japan, have, also, planned, future, crewed, space, missions, the, two, primary, global, programs, gaining, traction, in, the, 2020s, are, the, chinese, led, international, lunar, research, station, and, the, us, led, artemis, program, with, its, plan, to, build, the, lunar, gateway, and, the, artemis, base, camp, each, having, its, own, set, of, international, partners, the, first, telescope, is, said, to, have, been, invented, in, 1608, in, the, netherlands, by, an, eyeglass, maker, named, hans, lippershey, but, their, first, recorded, use, in, astronomy, was, by, galileo, galilei, in, 1609, in, 1668, isaac, newton, built, his, own, reflecting, telescope, the, first, fully, functional, telescope, of, this, kind, and, a, landmark, for, future, developments, due, to, its, superior, features, over, the, previous, galilean, telescope, a, string, of, discoveries, in, the, solar, system, and, beyond, followed, then, and, in, the, next, centuries, the, mountains, of, the, moon, the, phases, of, venus, the, main, satellites, of, jupiter, and, saturn, the, rings, of, saturn, many, comets, the, asteroids, the, new, planets, uranus, and, neptune, and, many, more, satellites, the, orbiting, astronomical, observatory, 2, was, the, first, space, telescope, launched, 1968, but, the, launching, of, hubble, space, telescope, in, 1990, set, a, milestone, as, of, 1, december, 2022, there, were, 5, 284, confirmed, exoplanets, discovered, the, milky, way, is, estimated, to, contain, 100, 400, billion, stars, and, more, than, 100, billion, planets, there, are, at, least, 2, trillion, galaxies, in, the, observable, universe, hd1, is, the, most, distant, known, object, from, earth, reported, as, 33, 4, billion, light, years, away, mw, 18014, was, a, german, v, 2, rocket, test, launch, that, took, place, on, 20, june, 1944, at, the, peenem, nde, army, research, center, in, peenem, nde, it, was, the, first, human, made, object, to, reach, outer, space, attaining, an, apogee, of, 176, kilometers, which, is, well, above, the, k, rm, n, line, it, was, a, vertical, test, launch, although, the, rocket, reached, space, it, did, not, reach, orbital, velocity, and, therefore, returned, to, earth, in, an, impact, becoming, the, first, sub, orbital, spaceflight, the, first, successful, orbital, launch, was, of, the, soviet, uncrewed, sputnik, 1, satellite, 1, mission, on, 4, october, 1957, the, satellite, weighed, about, 83, kg, 183, lb, and, is, believed, to, have, orbited, earth, at, a, height, of, about, 250, km, 160, mi, it, had, two, radio, transmitters, 20, and, 40, mhz, which, emitted, beeps, that, could, be, heard, by, radios, around, the, globe, analysis, of, the, radio, signals, was, used, to, gather, information, about, the, electron, density, of, the, ionosphere, while, temperature, and, pressure, data, was, encoded, in, the, duration, of, radio, beeps, the, results, indicated, that, the, satellite, was, not, punctured, by, a, meteoroid, sputnik, 1, was, launched, by, an, r, 7, rocket, it, burned, up, upon, re, entry, on, 3, january, 1958, the, first, successful, human, spaceflight, was, vostok, 1, east, 1, carrying, the, 27, year, old, russian, cosmonaut, yuri, gagarin, on, 12, april, 1961, the, spacecraft, completed, one, orbit, around, the, globe, lasting, about, 1, hour, and, 48, minutes, gagarin, s, flight, resonated, around, the, world, it, was, a, demonstration, of, the, advanced, soviet, space, program, and, it, opened, an, entirely, new, era, in, space, exploration, human, spaceflight, the, first, artificial, object, to, reach, another, celestial, body, was, luna, 2, reaching, the, moon, in, 1959, the, first, soft, landing, on, another, celestial, body, was, performed, by, luna, 9, landing, on, the, moon, on, 3, february, 1966, luna, 10, became, the, first, artificial, satellite, of, the, moon, entering, in, a, lunar, orbit, on, 3, april, 1966, the, first, crewed, landing, on, another, celestial, body, was, performed, by, apollo, 11, on, 20, july, 1969, landing, on, the, moon, there, have, been, a, total, of, six, spacecraft, with, humans, landing, on, the, moon, starting, from, 1969, to, the, last, human, landing, in, 1972, the, first, interplanetary, flyby, was, the, 1961, venera, 1, flyby, of, venus, though, the, 1962, mariner, 2, was, the, first, flyby, of, venus, to, return, data, closest, approach, 34, 773, kilometers, pioneer, 6, was, the, first, satellite, to, orbit, the, sun, launched, on, 16, december, 1965, the, other, planets, were, first, flown, by, in, 1965, for, mars, by, mariner, 4, 1973, for, jupiter, by, pioneer, 10, 1974, for, mercury, by, mariner, 10, 1979, for, saturn, by, pioneer, 11, 1986, for, uranus, by, voyager, 2, 1989, for, neptune, by, voyager, 2, in, 2015, the, dwarf, planets, ceres, and, pluto, were, orbited, by, dawn, and, passed, by, new, horizons, respectively, this, accounts, for, flybys, of, each, of, the, eight, planets, in, the, solar, system, the, sun, the, moon, and, ceres, and, pluto, two, of, the, five, recognized, dwarf, planets, the, first, interplanetary, surface, mission, to, return, at, least, limited, surface, data, from, another, planet, was, the, 1970, landing, of, venera, 7, which, returned, data, to, earth, for, 23, minutes, from, venus, in, 1975, the, venera, 9, was, the, first, to, return, images, from, the, surface, of, another, planet, returning, images, from, venus, in, 1971, the, mars, 3, mission, achieved, the, first, soft, landing, on, mars, returning, data, for, almost, 20, seconds, later, much, longer, duration, surface, missions, were, achieved, including, over, six, years, of, mars, surface, operation, by, viking, 1, from, 1975, to, 1982, and, over, two, hours, of, transmission, from, the, surface, of, venus, by, venera, 13, in, 1982, the, longest, ever, soviet, planetary, surface, mission, venus, and, mars, are, the, two, planets, outside, of, earth, on, which, humans, have, conducted, surface, missions, with, uncrewed, robotic, spacecraft, salyut, 1, was, the, first, space, station, of, any, kind, launched, into, low, earth, orbit, by, the, soviet, union, on, 19, april, 1971, the, international, space, station, is, currently, the, largest, and, oldest, of, the, 2, current, fully, functional, space, stations, inhabited, continuously, since, the, year, 2000, the, other, tiangong, space, station, built, by, china, is, now, fully, crewed, and, operational, voyager, 1, became, the, first, human, made, object, to, leave, the, solar, system, into, interstellar, space, on, 25, august, 2012, the, probe, passed, the, heliopause, at, 121, au, to, enter, interstellar, space, the, apollo, 13, flight, passed, the, far, side, of, the, moon, at, an, altitude, of, 254, kilometers, 158, miles, 137, nautical, miles, above, the, lunar, surface, and, 400, 171, km, 248, 655, mi, from, earth, marking, the, record, for, the, farthest, humans, have, ever, traveled, from, earth, in, 1970, as, of, 26, november, 2022, voyager, 1, was, at, a, distance, of, 159, au, 23, 8, billion, km, 14, 8, billion, mi, from, earth, it, is, the, most, distant, human, made, object, from, earth, starting, in, the, mid, 20th, century, probes, and, then, human, mission, were, sent, into, earth, orbit, and, then, on, to, the, moon, also, probes, were, sent, throughout, the, known, solar, system, and, into, solar, orbit, uncrewed, spacecraft, have, been, sent, into, orbit, around, saturn, jupiter, mars, venus, and, mercury, by, the, 21st, century, and, the, most, distance, active, spacecraft, voyager, 1, and, 2, traveled, beyond, 100, times, the, earth, sun, distance, the, instruments, were, enough, though, that, it, is, thought, they, have, left, the, sun, s, heliosphere, a, sort, of, bubble, of, particles, made, in, the, galaxy, by, the, sun, s, solar, wind, the, sun, is, a, major, focus, of, space, exploration, being, above, the, atmosphere, in, particular, and, earth, s, magnetic, field, gives, access, to, the, solar, wind, and, infrared, and, ultraviolet, radiations, that, cannot, reach, earth, s, surface, the, sun, generates, most, space, weather, which, can, affect, power, generation, and, transmission, systems, on, earth, and, interfere, with, and, even, damage, satellites, and, space, probes, numerous, spacecraft, dedicated, to, observing, the, sun, beginning, with, the, apollo, telescope, mount, have, been, launched, and, still, others, have, had, solar, observation, as, a, secondary, objective, parker, solar, probe, launched, in, 2018, will, approach, the, sun, to, within, 1, 9th, the, orbit, of, mercury, mercury, remains, the, least, explored, of, the, terrestrial, planets, as, of, may, 2013, the, mariner, 10, and, messenger, missions, have, been, the, only, missions, that, have, made, close, observations, of, mercury, messenger, entered, orbit, around, mercury, in, march, 2011, to, further, investigate, the, observations, made, by, mariner, 10, in, 1975, munsell, 2006b, a, third, mission, to, mercury, scheduled, to, arrive, in, 2025, bepicolombo, is, to, include, two, probes, bepicolombo, is, a, joint, mission, between, japan, and, the, european, space, agency, messenger, and, bepicolombo, are, intended, to, gather, complementary, data, to, help, scientists, understand, many, of, the, mysteries, discovered, by, mariner, 10, s, flybys, flights, to, other, planets, within, the, solar, system, are, accomplished, at, a, cost, in, energy, which, is, described, by, the, net, change, in, velocity, of, the, spacecraft, or, delta, v, due, to, the, relatively, high, delta, v, to, reach, mercury, and, its, proximity, to, the, sun, it, is, difficult, to, explore, and, orbits, around, it, are, rather, unstable, venus, was, the, first, target, of, interplanetary, flyby, and, lander, missions, and, despite, one, of, the, most, hostile, surface, environments, in, the, solar, system, has, had, more, landers, sent, to, it, nearly, all, from, the, soviet, union, than, any, other, planet, in, the, solar, system, the, first, flyby, was, the, 1961, venera, 1, though, the, 1962, mariner, 2, was, the, first, flyby, to, successfully, return, data, mariner, 2, has, been, followed, by, several, other, flybys, by, multiple, space, agencies, often, as, part, of, missions, using, a, venus, flyby, to, provide, a, gravitational, assist, en, route, to, other, celestial, bodies, in, 1967, venera, 4, became, the, first, probe, to, enter, and, directly, examine, the, atmosphere, of, venus, in, 1970, venera, 7, became, the, first, successful, lander, to, reach, the, surface, of, venus, and, by, 1985, it, had, been, followed, by, eight, additional, successful, soviet, venus, landers, which, provided, images, and, other, direct, surface, data, starting, in, 1975, with, the, soviet, orbiter, venera, 9, some, ten, successful, orbiter, missions, have, been, sent, to, venus, including, later, missions, which, were, able, to, map, the, surface, of, venus, using, radar, to, pierce, the, obscuring, atmosphere, space, exploration, has, been, used, as, a, tool, to, understand, earth, as, a, celestial, object, orbital, missions, can, provide, data, for, earth, that, can, be, difficult, or, impossible, to, obtain, from, a, purely, ground, based, point, of, reference, for, example, the, existence, of, the, van, allen, radiation, belts, was, unknown, until, their, discovery, by, the, united, states, first, artificial, satellite, explorer, 1, these, belts, contain, radiation, trapped, by, earth, s, magnetic, fields, which, currently, renders, construction, of, habitable, space, stations, above, 1000, km, impractical, following, this, early, unexpected, discovery, a, large, number, of, earth, observation, satellites, have, been, deployed, specifically, to, explore, earth, from, a, space, based, perspective, these, satellites, have, significantly, contributed, to, the, understanding, of, a, variety, of, earth, based, phenomena, for, instance, the, hole, in, the, ozone, layer, was, found, by, an, artificial, satellite, that, was, exploring, earth, s, atmosphere, and, satellites, have, allowed, for, the, discovery, of, archeological, sites, or, geological, formations, that, were, difficult, or, impossible, to, otherwise, identify, the, moon, was, the, first, celestial, body, to, be, the, object, of, space, exploration, it, holds, the, distinctions, of, being, the, first, remote, celestial, object, to, be, flown, by, orbited, and, landed, upon, by, spacecraft, and, the, only, remote, celestial, object, ever, to, be, visited, by, humans, in, 1959, the, soviets, obtained, the, first, images, of, the, far, side, of, the, moon, never, previously, visible, to, humans, the, u, s, exploration, of, the, moon, began, with, the, ranger, 4, impactor, in, 1962, starting, in, 1966, the, soviets, successfully, deployed, a, number, of, landers, to, the, moon, which, were, able, to, obtain, data, directly, from, the, moon, s, surface, just, four, months, later, surveyor, 1, marked, the, debut, of, a, successful, series, of, u, s, landers, the, soviet, uncrewed, missions, culminated, in, the, lunokhod, program, in, the, early, 1970s, which, included, the, first, uncrewed, rovers, and, also, successfully, brought, lunar, soil, samples, to, earth, for, study, this, marked, the, first, and, to, date, the, only, automated, return, of, extraterrestrial, soil, samples, to, earth, uncrewed, exploration, of, the, moon, continues, with, various, nations, periodically, deploying, lunar, orbiters, china, s, chang, e, 4, in, 2019, and, chang, e, 6, in, 2024, achieved, the, world, s, first, landing, and, sample, return, on, the, far, side, of, the, moon, india, s, chandrayaan, 3, in, 2023, achieved, the, world, s, first, landing, on, the, lunar, south, pole, region, crewed, exploration, of, the, moon, began, in, 1968, with, the, apollo, 8, mission, that, successfully, orbited, the, moon, the, first, time, any, extraterrestrial, object, was, orbited, by, humans, in, 1969, the, apollo, 11, mission, marked, the, first, time, humans, set, foot, upon, another, world, crewed, exploration, of, the, moon, did, not, continue, for, long, the, apollo, 17, mission, in, 1972, marked, the, sixth, landing, and, the, most, recent, human, visit, artemis, 2, is, scheduled, to, complete, a, crewed, flyby, of, the, moon, in, 2025, and, artemis, 3, will, perform, the, first, lunar, landing, since, apollo, 17, with, it, scheduled, for, launch, no, earlier, than, 2026, robotic, missions, are, still, pursued, vigorously, the, exploration, of, mars, has, been, an, important, part, of, the, space, exploration, programs, of, the, soviet, union, later, russia, the, united, states, europe, japan, and, india, dozens, of, robotic, spacecraft, including, orbiters, landers, and, rovers, have, been, launched, toward, mars, since, the, 1960s, these, missions, were, aimed, at, gathering, data, about, current, conditions, and, answering, questions, about, the, history, of, mars, the, questions, raised, by, the, scientific, community, are, expected, to, not, only, give, a, better, appreciation, of, the, red, planet, but, also, yield, further, insight, into, the, past, and, possible, future, of, earth, the, exploration, of, mars, has, come, at, a, considerable, financial, cost, with, roughly, two, thirds, of, all, spacecraft, destined, for, mars, failing, before, completing, their, missions, with, some, failing, before, they, even, began, such, a, high, failure, rate, can, be, attributed, to, the, complexity, and, large, number, of, variables, involved, in, an, interplanetary, journey, and, has, led, researchers, to, jokingly, speak, of, the, great, galactic, ghoul, which, subsists, on, a, diet, of, mars, probes, this, phenomenon, is, also, informally, known, as, the, mars, curse, in, contrast, to, overall, high, failure, rates, in, the, exploration, of, mars, india, has, become, the, first, country, to, achieve, success, of, its, maiden, attempt, india, s, mars, orbiter, mission, mom, is, one, of, the, least, expensive, interplanetary, missions, ever, undertaken, with, an, approximate, total, cost, of, 450, crore, us, 73, million, the, first, mission, to, mars, by, any, arab, country, has, been, taken, up, by, the, united, arab, emirates, called, the, emirates, mars, mission, it, was, launched, on, 19, july, 2020, and, went, into, orbit, around, mars, on, 9, february, 2021, the, uncrewed, exploratory, probe, was, named, hope, probe, and, was, sent, to, mars, to, study, its, atmosphere, in, detail, the, russian, space, mission, fobos, grunt, which, launched, on, 9, november, 2011, experienced, a, failure, leaving, it, stranded, in, low, earth, orbit, it, was, to, begin, exploration, of, the, phobos, and, martian, circumterrestrial, orbit, and, study, whether, the, moons, of, mars, or, at, least, phobos, could, be, a, trans, shipment, point, for, spaceships, traveling, to, mars, until, the, advent, of, space, travel, objects, in, the, asteroid, belt, were, merely, pinpricks, of, light, in, even, the, largest, telescopes, their, shapes, and, terrain, remaining, a, mystery, several, asteroids, have, now, been, visited, by, probes, the, first, of, which, was, galileo, which, flew, past, two, 951, gaspra, in, 1991, followed, by, 243, ida, in, 1993, both, of, these, lay, near, enough, to, galileo, s, planned, trajectory, to, jupiter, that, they, could, be, visited, at, acceptable, cost, the, first, landing, on, an, asteroid, was, performed, by, the, near, shoemaker, probe, in, 2000, following, an, orbital, survey, of, the, object, 433, eros, the, dwarf, planet, ceres, and, the, asteroid, 4, vesta, two, of, the, three, largest, asteroids, were, visited, by, nasa, s, dawn, spacecraft, launched, in, 2007, hayabusa, was, a, robotic, spacecraft, developed, by, the, japan, aerospace, exploration, agency, to, return, a, sample, of, material, from, the, small, near, earth, asteroid, 25143, itokawa, to, earth, for, further, analysis, hayabusa, was, launched, on, 9, may, 2003, and, rendezvoused, with, itokawa, in, mid, september, 2005, after, arriving, at, itokawa, hayabusa, studied, the, asteroid, s, shape, spin, topography, color, composition, density, and, history, in, november, 2005, it, landed, on, the, asteroid, twice, to, collect, samples, the, spacecraft, returned, to, earth, on, 13, june, 2010, the, exploration, of, jupiter, has, consisted, solely, of, a, number, of, automated, nasa, spacecraft, visiting, the, planet, since, 1973, a, large, majority, of, the, missions, have, been, flybys, in, which, detailed, observations, are, taken, without, the, probe, landing, or, entering, orbit, such, as, in, pioneer, and, voyager, programs, the, galileo, and, juno, spacecraft, are, the, only, spacecraft, to, have, entered, the, planet, s, orbit, as, jupiter, is, believed, to, have, only, a, relatively, small, rocky, core, and, no, real, solid, surface, a, landing, mission, is, precluded, reaching, jupiter, from, earth, requires, a, delta, v, of, 9, 2, km, s, which, is, comparable, to, the, 9, 7, km, s, delta, v, needed, to, reach, low, earth, orbit, fortunately, gravity, assists, through, planetary, flybys, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, energy, required, at, launch, to, reach, jupiter, albeit, at, the, cost, of, a, significantly, longer, flight, duration, jupiter, has, 95, known, moons, many, of, which, have, relatively, little, known, information, about, them, saturn, has, been, explored, only, through, uncrewed, spacecraft, launched, by, nasa, including, one, mission, cassini, huygens, planned, and, executed, in, cooperation, with, other, space, agencies, these, missions, consist, of, flybys, in, 1979, by, pioneer, 11, in, 1980, by, voyager, 1, in, 1982, by, voyager, 2, and, an, orbital, mission, by, the, cassini, spacecraft, which, lasted, from, 2004, until, 2017, saturn, has, at, least, 62, known, moons, although, the, exact, number, is, debatable, since, saturn, s, rings, are, made, up, of, vast, numbers, of, independently, orbiting, objects, of, varying, sizes, the, largest, of, the, moons, is, titan, which, holds, the, distinction, of, being, the, only, moon, in, the, solar, system, with, an, atmosphere, denser, and, thicker, than, that, of, earth, titan, holds, the, distinction, of, being, the, only, object, in, the, outer, solar, system, that, has, been, explored, with, a, lander, the, huygens, probe, deployed, by, the, cassini, spacecraft, the, exploration, of, uranus, has, been, entirely, through, the, voyager, 2, spacecraft, with, no, other, visits, currently, planned, given, its, axial, tilt, of, 97, 77, with, its, polar, regions, exposed, to, sunlight, or, darkness, for, long, periods, scientists, were, not, sure, what, to, expect, at, uranus, the, closest, approach, to, uranus, occurred, on, 24, january, 1986, voyager, 2, studied, the, planet, s, unique, atmosphere, and, magnetosphere, voyager, 2, also, examined, its, ring, system, and, the, moons, of, uranus, including, all, five, of, the, previously, known, moons, while, discovering, an, additional, ten, previously, unknown, moons, images, of, uranus, proved, to, have, a, very, uniform, appearance, with, no, evidence, of, the, dramatic, storms, or, atmospheric, banding, evident, on, jupiter, and, saturn, great, effort, was, required, to, even, identify, a, few, clouds, in, the, images, of, the, planet, the, magnetosphere, of, uranus, however, proved, to, be, unique, being, profoundly, affected, by, the, planet, s, unusual, axial, tilt, in, contrast, to, the, bland, appearance, of, uranus, itself, striking, images, were, obtained, of, the, moons, of, uranus, including, evidence, that, miranda, had, been, unusually, geologically, active, the, exploration, of, neptune, began, with, 25, august, 1989, voyager, 2, flyby, the, sole, visit, to, the, system, as, of, 2024, the, possibility, of, a, neptune, orbiter, has, been, discussed, but, no, other, missions, have, been, given, serious, thought, although, the, extremely, uniform, appearance, of, uranus, during, voyager, 2, s, visit, in, 1986, had, led, to, expectations, that, neptune, would, also, have, few, visible, atmospheric, phenomena, the, spacecraft, found, that, neptune, had, obvious, banding, visible, clouds, auroras, and, even, a, conspicuous, anticyclone, storm, system, rivaled, in, size, only, by, jupiter, s, great, red, spot, neptune, also, proved, to, have, the, fastest, winds, of, any, planet, in, the, solar, system, measured, as, high, as, 2, 100, km, h, voyager, 2, also, examined, neptune, s, ring, and, moon, system, it, discovered, 900, complete, rings, and, additional, partial, ring, arcs, around, neptune, in, addition, to, examining, neptune, s, three, previously, known, moons, voyager, 2, also, discovered, five, previously, unknown, moons, one, of, which, proteus, proved, to, be, the, last, largest, moon, in, the, system, data, from, voyager, 2, supported, the, view, that, neptune, s, largest, moon, triton, is, a, captured, kuiper, belt, object, the, dwarf, planet, pluto, presents, significant, challenges, for, spacecraft, because, of, its, great, distance, from, earth, requiring, high, velocity, for, reasonable, trip, times, and, small, mass, making, capture, into, orbit, very, difficult, at, present, voyager, 1, could, have, visited, pluto, but, controllers, opted, instead, for, a, close, flyby, of, saturn, s, moon, titan, resulting, in, a, trajectory, incompatible, with, a, pluto, flyby, voyager, 2, never, had, a, plausible, trajectory, for, reaching, pluto, after, an, intense, political, battle, a, mission, to, pluto, dubbed, new, horizons, was, granted, funding, from, the, united, states, government, in, 2003, new, horizons, was, launched, successfully, on, 19, january, 2006, in, early, 2007, the, craft, made, use, of, a, gravity, assist, from, jupiter, its, closest, approach, to, pluto, was, on, 14, july, 2015, scientific, observations, of, pluto, began, five, months, prior, to, closest, approach, and, continued, for, 16, days, after, the, encounter, the, new, horizons, mission, also, did, a, flyby, of, the, small, planetesimal, arrokoth, in, the, kuiper, belt, in, 2019, this, was, its, first, extended, mission, although, many, comets, have, been, studied, from, earth, sometimes, with, centuries, worth, of, observations, only, a, few, comets, have, been, closely, visited, in, 1985, the, international, cometary, explorer, conducted, the, first, comet, fly, by, 21p, giacobini, zinner, before, joining, the, halley, armada, studying, the, famous, comet, the, deep, impact, probe, smashed, into, 9p, tempel, to, learn, more, about, its, structure, and, composition, and, the, stardust, mission, returned, samples, of, another, comet, s, tail, the, philae, lander, successfully, landed, on, comet, churyumov, gerasimenko, in, 2014, as, part, of, the, broader, rosetta, mission, deep, space, exploration, is, the, branch, of, astronomy, astronautics, and, space, technology, that, is, involved, with, the, exploration, of, distant, regions, of, outer, space, physical, exploration, of, space, is, conducted, both, by, human, spaceflights, deep, space, astronautics, and, by, robotic, spacecraft, some, of, the, best, candidates, for, future, deep, space, engine, technologies, include, anti, matter, nuclear, power, and, beamed, propulsion, the, latter, beamed, propulsion, appears, to, be, the, best, candidate, for, deep, space, exploration, presently, available, since, it, uses, known, physics, and, known, technology, that, is, being, developed, for, other, purposes, breakthrough, starshot, is, a, research, and, engineering, project, by, the, breakthrough, initiatives, to, develop, a, proof, of, concept, fleet, of, light, sail, spacecraft, named, starchip, to, be, capable, of, making, the, journey, to, the, alpha, centauri, star, system, 4, 37, light, years, away, it, was, founded, in, 2016, by, yuri, milner, stephen, hawking, and, mark, zuckerberg, an, article, in, science, magazine, nature, suggested, the, use, of, asteroids, as, a, gateway, for, space, exploration, with, the, ultimate, destination, being, mars, in, order, to, make, such, an, approach, viable, three, requirements, need, to, be, fulfilled, first, a, thorough, asteroid, survey, to, find, thousands, of, nearby, bodies, suitable, for, astronauts, to, visit, second, extending, flight, duration, and, distance, capability, to, ever, increasing, ranges, out, to, mars, and, finally, developing, better, robotic, vehicles, and, tools, to, enable, astronauts, to, explore, an, asteroid, regardless, of, its, size, shape, or, spin, furthermore, using, asteroids, would, provide, astronauts, with, protection, from, galactic, cosmic, rays, with, mission, crews, being, able, to, land, on, them, without, great, risk, to, radiation, exposure, the, james, webb, space, telescope, jwst, or, webb, is, a, space, telescope, that, is, the, successor, to, the, hubble, space, telescope, the, jwst, will, provide, greatly, improved, resolution, and, sensitivity, over, the, hubble, and, will, enable, a, broad, range, of, investigations, across, the, fields, of, astronomy, and, cosmology, including, observing, some, of, the, most, distant, events, and, objects, in, the, universe, such, as, the, formation, of, the, first, galaxies, other, goals, include, understanding, the, formation, of, stars, and, planets, and, direct, imaging, of, exoplanets, and, novas, the, primary, mirror, of, the, james, webb, space, telescope, the, optical, telescope, element, is, composed, of, 18, hexagonal, mirror, segments, made, of, gold, plated, beryllium, which, combine, to, create, a, 6, 5, meter, 21, ft, 260, in, diameter, mirror, that, is, much, larger, than, the, hubble, s, 2, 4, meter, 7, 9, ft, 94, in, mirror, unlike, the, hubble, which, observes, in, the, near, ultraviolet, visible, and, near, infrared, 0, 1, to, 1, m, spectra, the, jwst, will, observe, in, a, lower, frequency, range, from, long, wavelength, visible, light, through, mid, infrared, 0, 6, to, 27, m, which, will, allow, it, to, observe, high, redshift, objects, that, are, too, old, and, too, distant, for, the, hubble, to, observe, the, telescope, must, be, kept, very, cold, in, order, to, observe, in, the, infrared, without, interference, so, it, will, be, deployed, in, space, near, the, earth, sun, l, 2, lagrangian, point, and, a, large, sunshield, made, of, silicon, and, aluminum, coated, kapton, will, keep, its, mirror, and, instruments, below, 50, k, 220, c, 370, f, the, artemis, program, is, an, ongoing, crewed, spaceflight, program, carried, out, by, nasa, u, s, commercial, spaceflight, companies, and, international, partners, such, as, esa, with, the, goal, of, landing, the, first, woman, and, the, next, man, on, the, moon, specifically, at, the, lunar, south, pole, region, by, 2024, artemis, would, be, the, next, step, towards, the, long, term, goal, of, establishing, a, sustainable, presence, on, the, moon, laying, the, foundation, for, private, companies, to, build, a, lunar, economy, and, eventually, sending, humans, to, mars, in, 2017, the, lunar, campaign, was, authorized, by, space, policy, directive, 1, utilizing, various, ongoing, spacecraft, programs, such, as, orion, the, lunar, gateway, commercial, lunar, payload, services, and, adding, an, undeveloped, crewed, lander, the, space, launch, system, will, serve, as, the, primary, launch, vehicle, for, orion, while, commercial, launch, vehicles, are, planned, for, use, to, launch, various, other, elements, of, the, campaign, nasa, requested, 1, 6, billion, in, additional, funding, for, artemis, for, fiscal, year, 2020, while, the, senate, appropriations, committee, requested, from, nasa, a, five, year, budget, profile, which, is, needed, for, evaluation, and, approval, by, congress, as, of, 2024, the, first, artemis, mission, was, launched, in, 2022, with, the, second, mission, a, crewed, lunar, flyby, planned, for, 2025, construction, on, the, lunar, gateway, is, underway, with, initial, capabilities, set, for, the, 2025, 2027, timeframe, the, first, clps, lander, landed, in, 2024, marking, the, first, us, spacecraft, to, land, since, apollo, 17, the, research, that, is, conducted, by, national, space, exploration, agencies, such, as, nasa, and, roscosmos, is, one, of, the, reasons, supporters, cite, to, justify, government, expenses, economic, analyses, of, the, nasa, programs, often, showed, ongoing, economic, benefits, such, as, nasa, spin, offs, generating, many, times, the, revenue, of, the, cost, of, the, program, it, is, also, argued, that, space, exploration, would, lead, to, the, extraction, of, resources, on, other, planets, and, especially, asteroids, which, contain, billions, of, dollars, worth, of, minerals, and, metals, such, expeditions, could, generate, a, lot, of, revenue, in, addition, it, has, been, argued, that, space, exploration, programs, help, inspire, youth, to, study, in, science, and, engineering, space, exploration, also, gives, scientists, the, ability, to, perform, experiments, in, other, settings, and, expand, humanity, s, knowledge, another, claim, is, that, space, exploration, is, a, necessity, to, humankind, and, that, staying, on, earth, will, lead, to, extinction, some, of, the, reasons, are, lack, of, natural, resources, comets, nuclear, war, and, worldwide, epidemic, stephen, hawking, renowned, british, theoretical, physicist, said, that, i, don, t, think, the, human, race, will, survive, the, next, thousand, years, unless, we, spread, into, space, there, are, too, many, accidents, that, can, befall, life, on, a, single, planet, but, i, m, an, optimist, we, will, reach, out, to, the, stars, arthur, c, clarke, 1950, presented, a, summary, of, motivations, for, the, human, exploration, of, space, in, his, non, fiction, semi, technical, monograph, interplanetary, flight, he, argued, that, humanity, s, choice, is, essentially, between, expansion, off, earth, into, space, versus, cultural, and, eventually, biological, stagnation, and, death, these, motivations, could, be, attributed, to, one, of, the, first, rocket, scientists, in, nasa, wernher, von, braun, and, his, vision, of, humans, moving, beyond, earth, the, basis, of, this, plan, was, to, develop, multi, stage, rockets, capable, of, placing, satellites, animals, and, humans, in, space, development, of, large, winged, reusable, spacecraft, capable, of, carrying, humans, and, equipment, into, earth, orbit, in, a, way, that, made, space, access, routine, and, cost, effective, construction, of, a, large, permanently, occupied, space, station, to, be, used, as, a, platform, both, to, observe, earth, and, from, which, to, launch, deep, space, expeditions, launching, the, first, human, flights, around, the, moon, leading, to, the, first, landings, of, humans, on, the, moon, with, the, intent, of, exploring, that, body, and, establishing, permanent, lunar, bases, assembly, and, fueling, of, spaceships, in, earth, orbit, for, the, purpose, of, sending, humans, to, mars, with, the, intent, of, eventually, colonizing, that, planet, known, as, the, von, braun, paradigm, the, plan, was, formulated, to, lead, humans, in, the, exploration, of, space, von, braun, s, vision, of, human, space, exploration, served, as, the, model, for, efforts, in, space, exploration, well, into, the, twenty, first, century, with, nasa, incorporating, this, approach, into, the, majority, of, their, projects, the, steps, were, followed, out, of, order, as, seen, by, the, apollo, program, reaching, the, moon, before, the, space, shuttle, program, was, started, which, in, turn, was, used, to, complete, the, international, space, station, von, braun, s, paradigm, formed, nasa, s, drive, for, human, exploration, in, the, hopes, that, humans, discover, the, far, reaches, of, the, universe, nasa, has, produced, a, series, of, public, service, announcement, videos, supporting, the, concept, of, space, exploration, overall, the, public, remains, largely, supportive, of, both, crewed, and, uncrewed, space, exploration, according, to, an, associated, press, poll, conducted, in, july, 2003, 71, of, u, s, citizens, agreed, with, the, statement, that, the, space, program, is, a, good, investment, compared, to, 21, who, did, not, space, advocacy, and, space, policy, regularly, invokes, exploration, as, a, human, nature, spaceflight, is, the, use, of, space, technology, to, achieve, the, flight, of, spacecraft, into, and, through, outer, space, spaceflight, is, used, in, space, exploration, and, also, in, commercial, activities, like, space, tourism, and, satellite, telecommunications, additional, non, commercial, uses, of, spaceflight, include, space, observatories, reconnaissance, satellites, and, other, earth, observation, satellites, a, spaceflight, typically, begins, with, a, rocket, launch, which, provides, the, initial, thrust, to, overcome, the, force, of, gravity, and, propels, the, spacecraft, from, the, surface, of, earth, once, in, space, the, motion, of, a, spacecraft, both, when, unpropelled, and, when, under, propulsion, is, covered, by, the, area, of, study, called, astrodynamics, some, spacecraft, remain, in, space, indefinitely, some, disintegrate, during, atmospheric, reentry, and, others, reach, a, planetary, or, lunar, surface, for, landing, or, impact, satellites, are, used, for, a, large, number, of, purposes, common, types, include, military, spy, and, civilian, earth, observation, satellites, communication, satellites, navigation, satellites, weather, satellites, and, research, satellites, space, stations, and, human, spacecraft, in, orbit, are, also, satellites, the, commercialization, of, space, first, started, out, with, the, launching, of, private, satellites, by, nasa, or, other, space, agencies, current, examples, of, the, commercial, satellite, use, of, space, include, satellite, navigation, systems, satellite, television, and, satellite, radio, the, next, step, of, commercialization, of, space, was, seen, as, human, spaceflight, flying, humans, safely, to, and, from, space, had, become, routine, to, nasa, reusable, spacecraft, were, an, entirely, new, engineering, challenge, something, only, seen, in, novels, and, films, like, star, trek, and, war, of, the, worlds, great, names, like, buzz, aldrin, supported, the, use, of, making, a, reusable, vehicle, like, the, space, shuttle, aldrin, held, that, reusable, spacecraft, were, the, key, in, making, space, travel, affordable, stating, that, the, use, of, passenger, space, travel, is, a, huge, potential, market, big, enough, to, justify, the, creation, of, reusable, launch, vehicles, how, can, the, public, go, against, the, words, of, one, of, america, s, best, known, heroes, in, space, exploration, after, all, exploring, space, is, the, next, great, expedition, following, the, example, of, lewis, and, clark, space, tourism, is, the, next, step, reusable, vehicles, in, the, commercialization, of, space, the, purpose, of, this, form, of, space, travel, is, used, by, individuals, for, the, purpose, of, personal, pleasure, private, spaceflight, companies, such, as, spacex, and, blue, origin, and, commercial, space, stations, such, as, the, axiom, space, and, the, bigelow, commercial, space, station, have, dramatically, changed, the, landscape, of, space, exploration, and, will, continue, to, do, so, in, the, near, future, astrobiology, is, the, interdisciplinary, study, of, life, in, the, universe, combining, aspects, of, astronomy, biology, and, geology, it, is, focused, primarily, on, the, study, of, the, origin, distribution, and, evolution, of, life, it, is, also, known, as, exobiology, from, greek, exo, outside, the, term, xenobiology, has, been, used, as, well, but, this, is, technically, incorrect, because, its, terminology, means, biology, of, the, foreigners, astrobiologists, must, also, consider, the, possibility, of, life, that, is, chemically, entirely, distinct, from, any, life, found, on, earth, in, the, solar, system, some, of, the, prime, locations, for, current, or, past, astrobiology, are, on, enceladus, europa, mars, and, titan, to, date, the, longest, human, occupation, of, space, is, the, international, space, station, which, has, been, in, continuous, use, for, 23, years, 316, days, valeri, polyakov, s, record, single, spaceflight, of, almost, 438, days, aboard, the, mir, space, station, has, not, been, surpassed, the, health, effects, of, space, have, been, well, documented, through, years, of, research, conducted, in, the, field, of, aerospace, medicine, analog, environments, similar, to, those, one, may, experience, in, space, travel, like, deep, sea, submarines, have, been, used, in, this, research, to, further, explore, the, relationship, between, isolation, and, extreme, environments, it, is, imperative, that, the, health, of, the, crew, be, maintained, as, any, deviation, from, baseline, may, compromise, the, integrity, of, the, mission, as, well, as, the, safety, of, the, crew, hence, the, reason, why, astronauts, must, endure, rigorous, medical, screenings, and, tests, prior, to, embarking, on, any, missions, however, it, does, not, take, long, for, the, environmental, dynamics, of, spaceflight, to, commence, its, toll, on, the, human, body, for, example, space, motion, sickness, sms, a, condition, which, affects, the, neurovestibular, system, and, culminates, in, mild, to, severe, signs, and, symptoms, such, as, vertigo, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and, disorientation, plagues, almost, all, space, travelers, within, their, first, few, days, in, orbit, space, travel, can, also, have, a, profound, impact, on, the, psyche, of, the, crew, members, as, delineated, in, anecdotal, writings, composed, after, their, retirement, space, travel, can, adversely, affect, the, body, s, natural, biological, clock, circadian, rhythm, sleep, patterns, causing, sleep, deprivation, and, fatigue, and, social, interaction, consequently, residing, in, a, low, earth, orbit, leo, environment, for, a, prolonged, amount, of, time, can, result, in, both, mental, and, physical, exhaustion, long, term, stays, in, space, reveal, issues, with, bone, and, muscle, loss, in, low, gravity, immune, system, suppression, and, radiation, exposure, the, lack, of, gravity, causes, fluid, to, rise, upward, which, can, cause, pressure, to, build, up, in, the, eye, resulting, in, vision, problems, the, loss, of, bone, minerals, and, densities, cardiovascular, deconditioning, and, decreased, endurance, and, muscle, mass, radiation, is, an, insidious, health, hazard, to, space, travelers, as, it, is, invisible, and, can, cause, cancer, when, above, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, spacecraft, are, no, longer, protected, from, the, sun, s, radiation, the, danger, of, radiation, is, even, more, potent, in, deep, space, the, hazards, of, radiation, can, be, ameliorated, through, protective, shielding, on, the, spacecraft, alerts, and, dosimetry, fortunately, with, new, and, rapidly, evolving, technological, advancements, those, in, mission, control, are, able, to, monitor, the, health, of, their, astronauts, more, closely, utilizing, telemedicine, one, may, not, be, able, to, completely, evade, the, physiological, effects, of, space, flight, but, they, can, be, mitigated, for, example, medical, systems, aboard, space, vessels, such, as, the, international, space, station, iss, are, well, equipped, and, designed, to, counteract, the, effects, of, lack, of, gravity, and, weightlessness, on, board, treadmills, can, help, prevent, muscle, loss, and, reduce, the, risk, of, developing, premature, osteoporosis, additionally, a, crew, medical, officer, is, appointed, for, each, iss, mission, and, a, flight, surgeon, is, available, 24, 7, via, the, iss, mission, control, center, located, in, houston, texas, although, the, interactions, are, intended, to, take, place, in, real, time, communications, between, the, space, and, terrestrial, crew, may, become, delayed, sometimes, by, as, much, as, 20, minutes, as, their, distance, from, each, other, increases, when, the, spacecraft, moves, further, out, of, leo, because, of, this, the, crew, are, trained, and, need, to, be, prepared, to, respond, to, any, medical, emergencies, that, may, arise, on, the, vessel, as, the, ground, crew, are, hundreds, of, miles, away, as, one, can, see, travelling, and, possibly, living, in, space, poses, many, challenges, many, past, and, current, concepts, for, the, continued, exploration, and, colonization, of, space, focus, on, a, return, to, the, moon, as, a, stepping, stone, to, the, other, planets, especially, mars, at, the, end, of, 2006, nasa, announced, they, were, planning, to, build, a, permanent, moon, base, with, continual, presence, by, 2024, beyond, the, technical, factors, that, could, make, living, in, space, more, widespread, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, lack, of, private, property, the, inability, or, difficulty, in, establishing, property, rights, in, space, has, been, an, impediment, to, the, development, of, space, for, human, habitation, since, the, advent, of, space, technology, in, the, latter, half, of, the, twentieth, century, the, ownership, of, property, in, space, has, been, murky, with, strong, arguments, both, for, and, against, in, particular, the, making, of, national, territorial, claims, in, outer, space, and, on, celestial, bodies, has, been, specifically, proscribed, by, the, outer, space, treaty, which, had, been, as, of, 2012, ratified, by, all, spacefaring, nations, space, colonization, also, called, space, settlement, and, space, humanization, would, be, the, permanent, autonomous, self, sufficient, human, habitation, of, locations, outside, earth, especially, of, natural, satellites, or, planets, such, as, the, moon, or, mars, using, significant, amounts, of, in, situ, resource, utilization, participation, and, representation, of, humanity, in, space, is, an, issue, ever, since, the, first, phase, of, space, exploration, some, rights, of, non, spacefaring, countries, have, been, mostly, secured, through, international, space, law, declaring, space, the, province, of, all, mankind, understanding, spaceflight, as, its, resource, though, sharing, of, space, for, all, humanity, is, still, criticized, as, imperialist, and, lacking, additionally, to, international, inclusion, the, inclusion, of, women, and, people, of, colour, has, also, been, lacking, to, reach, a, more, inclusive, spaceflight, some, organizations, like, the, justspace, alliance, and, iau, featured, inclusive, astronomy, have, been, formed, in, recent, years, the, first, woman, to, go, to, space, was, valentina, tereshkova, she, flew, in, 1963, but, it, was, not, until, the, 1980s, that, another, woman, entered, space, again, all, astronauts, were, required, to, be, military, test, pilots, at, the, time, and, women, were, not, able, to, join, this, career, this, is, one, reason, for, the, delay, in, allowing, women, to, join, space, crews, after, the, rule, changed, svetlana, savitskaya, became, the, second, woman, to, go, to, space, she, was, also, from, the, soviet, union, sally, ride, became, the, next, woman, in, space, and, the, first, woman, to, fly, to, space, through, the, united, states, program, since, then, eleven, other, countries, have, allowed, women, astronauts, the, first, all, female, space, walk, occurred, in, 2018, including, christina, koch, and, jessica, meir, they, had, both, previously, participated, in, space, walks, with, nasa, the, first, woman, to, go, to, the, moon, is, planned, for, 2024, despite, these, developments, women, are, still, underrepresented, among, astronauts, and, especially, cosmonauts, issues, that, block, potential, applicants, from, the, programs, and, limit, the, space, missions, they, are, able, to, go, on, include, artistry, in, and, from, space, ranges, from, signals, capturing, and, arranging, material, like, yuri, gagarin, s, selfie, in, space, or, the, image, the, blue, marble, over, drawings, like, the, first, one, in, space, by, cosmonaut, and, artist, alexei, leonov, music, videos, like, chris, hadfield, s, cover, of, space, oddity, on,
