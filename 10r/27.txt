plant, breeding, is, the, science, of, changing, the, traits, of, plants, in, order, to, produce, desired, characteristics, it, has, been, used, to, improve, the, quality, of, nutrition, in, products, for, humans, and, animals, the, goals, of, plant, breeding, are, to, produce, crop, varieties, that, boast, unique, and, superior, traits, for, a, variety, of, applications, the, most, frequently, addressed, agricultural, traits, are, those, related, to, biotic, and, abiotic, stress, tolerance, grain, or, biomass, yield, end, use, quality, characteristics, such, as, taste, or, the, concentrations, of, specific, biological, molecules, proteins, sugars, lipids, vitamins, fibers, and, ease, of, processing, harvesting, milling, baking, malting, blending, etc, plant, breeding, can, be, performed, through, many, different, techniques, ranging, from, simply, selecting, plants, with, desirable, characteristics, for, propagation, to, methods, that, make, use, of, knowledge, of, genetics, and, chromosomes, to, more, complex, molecular, techniques, genes, in, a, plant, are, what, determine, what, type, of, qualitative, or, quantitative, traits, it, will, have, plant, breeders, strive, to, create, a, specific, outcome, of, plants, and, potentially, new, plant, varieties, and, in, the, course, of, doing, so, narrow, down, the, genetic, diversity, of, that, variety, to, a, specific, few, biotypes, it, is, practiced, worldwide, by, individuals, such, as, gardeners, and, farmers, and, by, professional, plant, breeders, employed, by, organizations, such, as, government, institutions, universities, crop, specific, industry, associations, or, research, centers, international, development, agencies, believe, that, breeding, new, crops, is, important, for, ensuring, food, security, by, developing, new, varieties, that, are, higher, yielding, disease, resistant, drought, tolerant, or, regionally, adapted, to, different, environments, and, growing, conditions, a, recent, study, shows, that, without, plant, breeding, europe, would, have, produced, 20, fewer, arable, crops, over, the, last, 20, years, consuming, an, additional, 21, 6, million, hectares, 53, million, acres, of, land, and, emitting, 4, billion, tonnes, 3, 9, 10, 9, long, tons, 4, 4, 10, 9, short, tons, of, carbon, wheat, species, created, for, morocco, are, currently, being, crossed, with, plants, to, create, new, varieties, for, northern, france, soy, beans, which, were, previously, grown, predominantly, in, the, south, of, france, are, now, grown, in, southern, germany, plant, breeding, started, with, sedentary, agriculture, and, particularly, the, domestication, of, the, first, agricultural, plants, a, practice, which, is, estimated, to, date, back, 9, 000, to, 11, 000, years, initially, early, farmers, simply, selected, food, plants, with, particular, desirable, characteristics, and, employed, these, as, progenitors, for, subsequent, generations, resulting, in, an, accumulation, of, valuable, traits, over, time, grafting, technology, had, been, practiced, in, china, before, 2000, bce, by, 500, bce, grafting, was, well, established, and, practiced, gregor, mendel, 1822, 84, is, considered, the, father, of, genetics, his, experiments, with, plant, hybridization, led, to, his, establishing, laws, of, inheritance, genetics, stimulated, research, to, improve, crop, production, through, plant, breeding, modern, plant, breeding, is, applied, genetics, but, its, scientific, basis, is, broader, covering, molecular, biology, cytology, systematics, physiology, pathology, entomology, chemistry, and, statistics, biometrics, it, has, also, developed, its, own, technology, one, major, technique, of, plant, breeding, is, selection, the, process, of, selectively, propagating, plants, with, desirable, characteristics, and, eliminating, or, culling, those, with, less, desirable, characteristics, another, technique, is, the, deliberate, interbreeding, crossing, of, closely, or, distantly, related, individuals, to, produce, new, crop, varieties, or, lines, with, desirable, properties, plants, are, crossbred, to, introduce, traits, genes, from, one, variety, or, line, into, a, new, genetic, background, for, example, a, mildew, resistant, pea, may, be, crossed, with, a, high, yielding, but, susceptible, pea, the, goal, of, the, cross, being, to, introduce, mildew, resistance, without, losing, the, high, yield, characteristics, progeny, from, the, cross, would, then, be, crossed, with, the, high, yielding, parent, to, ensure, that, the, progeny, were, most, like, the, high, yielding, parent, backcrossing, the, progeny, from, that, cross, would, then, be, tested, for, yield, selection, as, described, above, and, mildew, resistance, and, high, yielding, resistant, plants, would, be, further, developed, plants, may, also, be, crossed, with, themselves, to, produce, inbred, varieties, for, breeding, pollinators, may, be, excluded, through, the, use, of, pollination, bags, classical, breeding, relies, largely, on, homologous, recombination, between, chromosomes, to, generate, genetic, diversity, the, classical, plant, breeder, may, also, make, use, of, a, number, of, in, vitro, techniques, such, as, protoplast, fusion, embryo, rescue, or, mutagenesis, see, below, to, generate, diversity, and, produce, hybrid, plants, that, would, not, exist, in, nature, traits, that, breeders, have, tried, to, incorporate, into, crop, plants, include, successful, commercial, plant, breeding, concerns, were, founded, from, the, late, 19th, century, gartons, agricultural, plant, breeders, in, england, was, established, in, the, 1890s, by, john, garton, who, was, one, of, the, first, to, commercialize, new, varieties, of, agricultural, crops, created, through, cross, pollination, the, firm, s, first, introduction, was, the, abundance, oat, an, oat, variety, it, is, one, of, the, first, agricultural, grain, varieties, bred, from, a, controlled, cross, introduced, to, commerce, in, 1892, in, the, early, 20th, century, plant, breeders, realized, that, gregor, mendel, s, findings, on, the, non, random, nature, of, inheritance, could, be, applied, to, seedling, populations, produced, through, deliberate, pollinations, to, predict, the, frequencies, of, different, types, wheat, hybrids, were, bred, to, increase, the, crop, production, of, italy, during, the, so, called, battle, for, grain, 1925, 1940, heterosis, was, explained, by, george, harrison, shull, it, describes, the, tendency, of, the, progeny, of, a, specific, cross, to, outperform, both, parents, the, detection, of, the, usefulness, of, heterosis, for, plant, breeding, has, led, to, the, development, of, inbred, lines, that, reveal, a, heterotic, yield, advantage, when, they, are, crossed, maize, was, the, first, species, where, heterosis, was, widely, used, to, produce, hybrids, statistical, methods, were, also, developed, to, analyze, gene, action, and, distinguish, heritable, variation, from, variation, caused, by, environment, in, 1933, another, important, breeding, technique, cytoplasmic, male, sterility, cms, developed, in, maize, was, described, by, marcus, morton, rhoades, cms, is, a, maternally, inherited, trait, that, makes, the, plant, produce, sterile, pollen, this, enables, the, production, of, hybrids, without, the, need, for, labor, intensive, detasseling, these, early, breeding, techniques, resulted, in, large, yield, increase, in, the, united, states, in, the, early, 20th, century, similar, yield, increases, were, not, produced, elsewhere, until, after, world, war, ii, the, green, revolution, increased, crop, production, in, the, developing, world, in, the, 1960s, following, world, war, ii, a, number, of, techniques, were, developed, that, allowed, plant, breeders, to, hybridize, distantly, related, species, and, artificially, induce, genetic, diversity, when, distantly, related, species, are, crossed, plant, breeders, make, use, of, a, number, of, plant, tissue, culture, techniques, to, produce, progeny, from, otherwise, fruitless, mating, interspecific, and, intergeneric, hybrids, are, produced, from, a, cross, of, related, species, or, genera, that, do, not, normally, sexually, reproduce, with, each, other, these, crosses, are, referred, to, as, wide, crosses, for, example, the, cereal, triticale, is, a, wheat, and, rye, hybrid, the, cells, in, the, plants, derived, from, the, first, generation, created, from, the, cross, contained, an, uneven, number, of, chromosomes, and, as, a, result, was, sterile, the, cell, division, inhibitor, colchicine, was, used, to, double, the, number, of, chromosomes, in, the, cell, and, thus, allow, the, production, of, a, fertile, line, failure, to, produce, a, hybrid, may, be, due, to, pre, or, post, fertilization, incompatibility, if, fertilization, is, possible, between, two, species, or, genera, the, hybrid, embryo, may, abort, before, maturation, if, this, does, occur, the, embryo, resulting, from, an, interspecific, or, intergeneric, cross, can, sometimes, be, rescued, and, cultured, to, produce, a, whole, plant, such, a, method, is, referred, to, as, embryo, rescue, this, technique, has, been, used, to, produce, new, rice, for, africa, an, interspecific, cross, of, asian, rice, oryza, sativa, and, african, rice, o, glaberrima, hybrids, may, also, be, produced, by, a, technique, called, protoplast, fusion, in, this, case, protoplasts, are, fused, usually, in, an, electric, field, viable, recombinants, can, be, regenerated, in, culture, chemical, mutagens, like, ethyl, methanesulfonate, ems, and, dimethyl, sulfate, dms, radiation, and, transposons, are, used, for, mutagenesis, mutagenesis, is, the, generation, of, mutants, the, breeder, hopes, for, desirable, traits, to, be, bred, with, other, cultivars, a, process, known, as, mutation, breeding, classical, plant, breeders, also, generate, genetic, diversity, within, a, species, by, exploiting, a, process, called, somaclonal, variation, which, occurs, in, plants, produced, from, tissue, culture, particularly, plants, derived, from, callus, induced, polyploidy, and, the, addition, or, removal, of, chromosomes, using, a, technique, called, chromosome, engineering, may, also, be, used, when, a, desirable, trait, has, been, bred, into, a, species, a, number, of, crosses, to, the, favored, parent, are, made, to, make, the, new, plant, as, similar, to, the, favored, parent, as, possible, returning, to, the, example, of, the, mildew, resistant, pea, being, crossed, with, a, high, yielding, but, susceptible, pea, to, make, the, mildew, resistant, progeny, of, the, cross, most, like, the, high, yielding, parent, the, progeny, will, be, crossed, back, to, that, parent, for, several, generations, see, backcrossing, this, process, removes, most, of, the, genetic, contribution, of, the, mildew, resistant, parent, classical, breeding, is, therefore, a, cyclical, process, with, classical, breeding, techniques, the, breeder, does, not, know, exactly, what, genes, have, been, introduced, to, the, new, cultivars, some, scientists, therefore, argue, that, plants, produced, by, classical, breeding, methods, should, undergo, the, same, safety, testing, regime, as, genetically, modified, plants, there, have, been, instances, where, plants, bred, using, classical, techniques, have, been, unsuitable, for, human, consumption, for, example, the, poison, solanine, was, unintentionally, increased, to, unacceptable, levels, in, certain, varieties, of, potato, through, plant, breeding, new, potato, varieties, are, often, screened, for, solanine, levels, before, reaching, the, marketplace, even, with, the, very, latest, in, biotech, assisted, conventional, breeding, incorporation, of, a, trait, takes, an, average, of, seven, generations, for, clonally, propagated, crops, nine, for, self, fertilising, and, seventeen, for, cross, pollinating, modern, plant, breeding, may, use, techniques, of, molecular, biology, to, select, or, in, the, case, of, genetic, modification, to, insert, desirable, traits, into, plants, application, of, biotechnology, or, molecular, biology, is, also, known, as, molecular, breeding, sometimes, many, different, genes, can, influence, a, desirable, trait, in, plant, breeding, the, use, of, tools, such, as, molecular, markers, or, dna, fingerprinting, can, map, thousands, of, genes, this, allows, plant, breeders, to, screen, large, populations, of, plants, for, those, that, possess, the, trait, of, interest, the, screening, is, based, on, the, presence, or, absence, of, a, certain, gene, as, determined, by, laboratory, procedures, rather, than, on, the, visual, identification, of, the, expressed, trait, in, the, plant, the, purpose, of, marker, assisted, selection, or, plant, genome, analysis, is, to, identify, the, location, and, function, phenotype, of, various, genes, within, the, genome, if, all, of, the, genes, are, identified, it, leads, to, genome, sequence, all, plants, have, varying, sizes, and, lengths, of, genomes, with, genes, that, code, for, different, proteins, but, many, are, also, the, same, if, a, gene, s, location, and, function, is, identified, in, one, plant, species, a, very, similar, gene, likely, can, also, be, found, in, a, similar, location, in, another, related, species, genome, homozygous, plants, with, desirable, traits, can, be, produced, from, heterozygous, starting, plants, if, a, haploid, cell, with, the, alleles, for, those, traits, can, be, produced, and, then, used, to, make, a, doubled, haploid, the, doubled, haploid, will, be, homozygous, for, the, desired, traits, furthermore, two, different, homozygous, plants, created, in, that, way, can, be, used, to, produce, a, generation, of, f1, hybrid, plants, which, have, the, advantages, of, heterozygosity, and, a, greater, range, of, possible, traits, thus, an, individual, heterozygous, plant, chosen, for, its, desirable, characteristics, can, be, converted, into, a, heterozygous, variety, f1, hybrid, without, the, necessity, of, vegetative, reproduction, but, as, the, result, of, the, cross, of, two, homozygous, doubled, haploid, lines, derived, from, the, originally, selected, plant, plant, tissue, culturing, can, produce, haploid, or, double, haploid, plant, lines, and, generations, this, cuts, down, the, genetic, diversity, taken, from, that, plant, species, in, order, to, select, for, desirable, traits, that, will, increase, the, fitness, of, the, individuals, using, this, method, decreases, the, need, for, breeding, multiple, generations, of, plants, to, get, a, generation, that, is, homogeneous, for, the, desired, traits, thereby, saving, much, time, over, the, natural, version, of, the, same, process, there, are, many, plant, tissue, culturing, techniques, that, can, be, used, to, achieve, haploid, plants, but, microspore, culturing, is, currently, the, most, promising, for, producing, the, largest, numbers, of, them, genetic, modification, of, plants, is, achieved, by, adding, a, specific, gene, or, genes, to, a, plant, or, by, knocking, down, a, gene, with, rnai, to, produce, a, desirable, phenotype, the, plants, resulting, from, adding, a, gene, are, often, referred, to, as, transgenic, plants, if, for, genetic, modification, genes, of, the, species, or, of, a, crossable, plant, are, used, under, control, of, their, native, promoter, then, they, are, called, cisgenic, plants, sometimes, genetic, modification, can, produce, a, plant, with, the, desired, trait, or, traits, faster, than, classical, breeding, because, the, majority, of, the, plant, s, genome, is, not, altered, to, genetically, modify, a, plant, a, genetic, construct, must, be, designed, so, that, the, gene, to, be, added, or, removed, will, be, expressed, by, the, plant, to, do, this, a, promoter, to, drive, transcription, and, a, termination, sequence, to, stop, transcription, of, the, new, gene, and, the, gene, or, genes, of, interest, must, be, introduced, to, the, plant, a, marker, for, the, selection, of, transformed, plants, is, also, included, in, the, laboratory, antibiotic, resistance, is, a, commonly, used, marker, plants, that, have, been, successfully, transformed, will, grow, on, media, containing, antibiotics, plants, that, have, not, been, transformed, will, die, in, some, instances, markers, for, selection, are, removed, by, backcrossing, with, the, parent, plant, prior, to, commercial, release, the, construct, can, be, inserted, in, the, plant, genome, by, genetic, recombination, using, the, bacteria, agrobacterium, tumefaciens, or, a, rhizogenes, or, by, direct, methods, like, the, gene, gun, or, microinjection, using, plant, viruses, to, insert, genetic, constructs, into, plants, is, also, a, possibility, but, the, technique, is, limited, by, the, host, range, of, the, virus, for, example, cauliflower, mosaic, virus, camv, only, infects, cauliflower, and, related, species, another, limitation, of, viral, vectors, is, that, the, virus, is, not, usually, passed, on, to, the, progeny, so, every, plant, has, to, be, inoculated, the, majority, of, commercially, released, transgenic, plants, are, currently, limited, to, plants, that, have, introduced, resistance, to, insect, pests, and, herbicides, insect, resistance, is, achieved, through, incorporation, of, a, gene, from, bacillus, thuringiensis, bt, that, encodes, a, protein, that, is, toxic, to, some, insects, for, example, the, cotton, bollworm, a, common, cotton, pest, feeds, on, bt, cotton, it, will, ingest, the, toxin, and, die, herbicides, usually, work, by, binding, to, certain, plant, enzymes, and, inhibiting, their, action, the, enzymes, that, the, herbicide, inhibits, are, known, as, the, herbicide, s, target, site, herbicide, resistance, can, be, engineered, into, crops, by, expressing, a, version, of, target, site, protein, that, is, not, inhibited, by, the, herbicide, this, is, the, method, used, to, produce, glyphosate, resistant, roundup, ready, crop, plants, genetic, modification, can, further, increase, yields, by, increasing, stress, tolerance, to, a, given, environment, stresses, such, as, temperature, variation, are, signalled, to, the, plant, via, a, cascade, of, signalling, molecules, which, will, activate, a, transcription, factor, to, regulate, gene, expression, overexpression, of, particular, genes, involved, in, cold, acclimation, has, been, shown, to, produce, more, resistance, to, freezing, which, is, one, common, cause, of, yield, loss, genetic, modification, of, plants, that, can, produce, pharmaceuticals, and, industrial, chemicals, sometimes, called, pharming, is, a, rather, radical, new, area, of, plant, breeding, the, debate, surrounding, genetically, modified, food, during, the, 1990s, peaked, in, 1999, in, terms, of, media, coverage, and, risk, perception, and, continues, today, for, example, germany, has, thrown, its, weight, behind, a, growing, european, mutiny, over, genetically, modified, crops, by, banning, the, planting, of, a, widely, grown, pest, resistant, corn, variety, the, debate, encompasses, the, ecological, impact, of, genetically, modified, plants, the, safety, of, genetically, modified, food, and, concepts, used, for, safety, evaluation, like, substantial, equivalence, such, concerns, are, not, new, to, plant, breeding, most, countries, have, regulatory, processes, in, place, to, help, ensure, that, new, crop, varieties, entering, the, marketplace, are, both, safe, and, meet, farmers, needs, examples, include, variety, registration, seed, schemes, regulatory, authorizations, for, gm, plants, etc, industrial, breeding, of, plants, has, unintentionally, altered, how, agricultural, cultivars, associate, with, their, microbiome, in, maize, for, example, breeding, has, altered, the, nitrogen, cycling, taxa, required, to, the, rhizosphere, with, more, modern, lines, recruiting, less, nitrogen, fixing, taxa, and, more, nitrifiers, and, denitrifiers, microbiomes, of, breeding, lines, showed, that, hybrid, plants, share, much, of, their, bacterial, community, with, their, parents, such, as, cucurbita, seeds, and, apple, shoot, endophytes, in, addition, the, proportional, contribution, of, the, microbiome, from, parents, to, offspring, corresponds, to, the, amount, of, genetic, material, contributed, by, each, parent, during, breeding, and, domestication, as, of, 2020, machine, learning, and, especially, deep, machine, learning, has, recently, become, more, commonly, used, in, phenotyping, computer, vision, using, ml, has, made, great, strides, and, is, now, being, applied, to, leaf, phenotyping, and, other, phenotyping, jobs, typically, performed, by, human, eyes, pound, et, al, 2017, and, singh, et, al, 2016, are, especially, salient, examples, of, early, successful, application, and, demonstration, of, the, general, usability, of, the, process, across, multiple, target, plant, species, these, methods, will, work, even, better, with, large, publicly, available, open, data, sets, speed, breeding, is, introduced, by, watson, et, al, 2018, classical, human, performed, phenotyping, during, speed, breeding, is, also, possible, using, a, procedure, developed, by, richard, et, al, 2015, as, of, 2020, it, is, highly, anticipated, that, sb, and, automated, phenotyping, will, combined, produce, greatly, improved, outcomes, see, phenotyping, and, artificial, intelligence, above, the, ngs, platform, has, substantially, declined, the, time, and, cost, required, for, sequencing, and, facilitated, snp, discovery, in, model, and, non, model, plants, this, in, turn, has, led, to, employing, large, scale, snp, markers, in, genomic, selection, approaches, which, aim, at, predicting, genomic, breeding, values, gebvs, of, genotypes, in, a, given, population, this, method, can, increase, the, selection, accuracy, and, decrease, the, time, of, each, breeding, cycle, it, has, been, used, in, different, crops, such, as, maize, wheat, etc, participatory, plant, breeding, ppb, is, when, farmers, are, involved, in, a, crop, improvement, programme, with, opportunities, to, make, decisions, and, contribute, to, the, research, process, at, different, stages, participatory, approaches, to, crop, improvement, can, also, be, applied, when, plant, biotechnologies, are, being, used, for, crop, improvement, local, agricultural, systems, and, genetic, diversity, are, strengthened, by, participatory, programs, and, outcomes, are, enhanced, by, farmers, knowledge, of, the, quality, required, and, evaluation, of, the, target, environment, a, 2019, review, of, participatory, plant, breeding, indicated, that, it, had, not, gained, widespread, acceptance, despite, its, record, of, successfully, developing, varieties, with, improved, diversity, and, nutritional, quality, as, well, as, greater, likelihood, of, these, improved, varieties, being, adopted, by, farmers, this, review, also, found, participatory, plant, breeding, to, have, a, better, cost, benefit, ratio, than, non, participatory, approaches, and, suggested, incorporating, participatory, plant, breeding, with, evolutionary, plant, breeding, evolutionary, plant, breeding, describes, practices, which, use, mass, populations, with, diverse, genotypes, grown, under, competitive, natural, selection, survival, in, common, crop, cultivation, environments, is, the, predominant, method, of, selection, rather, than, direct, selection, by, growers, and, breeders, individual, plants, that, are, favored, under, prevailing, growing, conditions, such, as, environment, and, inputs, contribute, more, seed, to, the, next, generation, than, less, adapted, individuals, evolutionary, plant, breeding, has, been, successfully, used, by, the, nepal, national, gene, bank, to, preserve, landrace, diversity, within, jumli, marshi, rice, while, reducing, its, susceptibility, to, blast, disease, these, practices, have, also, been, used, in, nepal, with, bean, landraces, in, 1929, harlan, and, martini, proposed, a, method, of, plant, breeding, with, heterogeneous, populations, by, pooling, an, equal, number, of, f2, seeds, obtained, from, 378, crosses, among, 28, geographically, diverse, barley, cultivars, in, 1938, harlan, and, martini, demonstrated, evolution, by, natural, selection, in, mixed, dynamic, populations, as, a, few, varieties, that, became, dominant, in, some, locations, almost, disappeared, in, others, poorly, adapted, varieties, disappeared, everywhere, evolutionary, breeding, populations, have, been, used, to, establish, self, regulating, plant, pathogen, systems, examples, include, barley, where, breeders, were, able, to, improve, resistance, to, rynchosporium, secalis, scald, over, 45, generations, an, evolutionary, breeding, project, grew, f5, hybrid, bulk, soybean, populations, on, soil, infested, by, the, soybean, cyst, nematode, and, was, able, to, increase, the, proportion, of, resistant, plants, from, 5, to, 40, the, international, center, for, agricultural, research, in, the, dry, areas, icarda, evolutionary, plant, breeding, is, combined, with, participatory, plant, breeding, in, order, to, allow, farmers, to, choose, which, varieties, suit, their, needs, in, their, local, environment, an, influential, 1956, effort, by, coit, a, suneson, to, codify, this, approach, coined, the, term, evolutionary, plant, breeding, and, concluded, that, 15, generations, of, natural, selection, are, desirable, to, produce, results, that, are, competitive, with, conventional, breeding, evolutionary, breeding, allows, working, with, much, larger, plant, population, sizes, than, conventional, breeding, it, has, also, been, used, in, tandem, with, conventional, practices, in, order, to, develop, both, heterogeneous, and, homogeneous, crop, lines, for, low, input, agricultural, systems, that, have, unpredictable, stress, conditions, evolutionary, plant, breeding, has, been, delineated, into, four, stages, issues, facing, plant, breeding, in, the, future, include, the, lack, of, arable, land, increasingly, harsh, cropping, conditions, and, the, need, to, maintain, food, security, which, involves, being, able, to, provide, the, world, population, with, sufficient, nutrition, crops, need, to, be, able, to, mature, in, multiple, environments, to, allow, worldwide, access, which, involves, solving, problems, including, drought, tolerance, it, has, been, suggested, that, global, solutions, are, achievable, through, the, process, of, plant, breeding, with, its, ability, to, select, specific, genes, allowing, crops, to, perform, at, a, level, which, yields, the, desired, results, one, issue, facing, agriculture, is, the, loss, of, landraces, and, other, local, varieties, which, have, diversity, that, may, have, useful, genes, for, climate, adaptation, in, the, future, conventional, breeding, intentionally, limits, phenotype, plasticity, within, genotypes, and, limits, variability, between, genotypes, uniformity, does, not, allow, crops, to, adapt, to, climate, change, and, other, biotic, stresses, and, abiotic, stresses, plant, breeders, rights, is, an, important, and, controversial, issue, production, of, new, varieties, is, dominated, by, commercial, plant, breeders, who, seek, to, protect, their, work, and, collect, royalties, through, national, and, international, agreements, based, in, intellectual, property, rights, the, range, of, related, issues, is, complex, in, the, simplest, terms, critics, of, the, increasingly, restrictive, regulations, argue, that, through, a, combination, of, technical, and, economic, pressures, commercial, breeders, are, reducing, biodiversity, and, significantly, constraining, individuals, such, as, farmers, from, developing, and, trading, seed, on, a, regional, level, efforts, to, strengthen, breeders, rights, for, example, by, lengthening, periods, of, variety, protection, are, ongoing, intellectual, property, legislation, for, plants, often, uses, definitions, that, typically, include, genetic, uniformity, and, unchanging, appearance, over, generations, these, legal, definitions, of, stability, contrast, with, traditional, agronomic, usage, which, considers, stability, in, terms, of, how, consistent, the, yield, or, quality, of, a, crop, remains, across, locations, and, over, time, as, of, 2020, regulations, in, nepal, only, allow, uniform, varieties, to, be, registered, or, released, evolutionary, plant, populations, and, many, landraces, are, polymorphic, and, do, not, meet, these, standards, uniform, and, genetically, stable, cultivars, can, be, inadequate, for, dealing, with, environmental, fluctuations, and, novel, stress, factors, plant, breeders, have, focused, on, identifying, crops, which, will, ensure, crops, perform, under, these, conditions, a, way, to, achieve, this, is, finding, strains, of, the, crop, that, is, resistance, to, drought, conditions, with, low, nitrogen, it, is, evident, from, this, that, plant, breeding, is, vital, for, future, agriculture, to, survive, as, it, enables, farmers, to, produce, stress, resistant, crops, hence, improving, food, security, in, countries, that, experience, harsh, winters, such, as, iceland, germany, and, further, east, in, europe, plant, breeders, are, involved, in, breeding, for, tolerance, to, frost, continuous, snow, cover, frost, drought, desiccation, from, wind, and, solar, radiation, under, frost, and, high, moisture, levels, in, soil, in, winter, breeding, is, not, a, quick, process, which, is, especially, important, when, breeding, to, ameliorate, a, disease, the, average, time, from, human, recognition, of, a, new, fungal, disease, threat, to, the, release, of, a, resistant, crop, for, that, pathogen, is, at, least, twelve, years, when, new, plant, breeds, or, cultivars, are, bred, they, must, be, maintained, and, propagated, some, plants, are, propagated, by, asexual, means, while, others, are, propagated, by, seeds, seed, propagated, cultivars, require, specific, control, over, seed, source, and, production, procedures, to, maintain, the, integrity, of, the, plant, breeds, results, isolation, is, necessary, to, prevent, cross, contamination, with, related, plants, or, the, mixing, of, seeds, after, harvesting, isolation, is, normally, accomplished, by, planting, distance, but, in, certain, crops, plants, are, enclosed, in, greenhouses, or, cages, most, commonly, used, when, producing, f1, hybrids, modern, plant, breeding, whether, classical, or, through, genetic, engineering, comes, with, issues, of, concern, particularly, with, regard, to, food, crops, the, question, of, whether, breeding, can, have, a, negative, effect, on, nutritional, value, is, central, in, this, respect, although, relatively, little, direct, research, in, this, area, has, been, done, there, are, scientific, indications, that, by, favoring, certain, aspects, of, a, plant, s, development, other, aspects, may, be, retarded, a, study, published, in, the, journal, of, the, american, college, of, nutrition, in, 2004, entitled, changes, in, usda, food, composition, data, for, 43, garden, crops, 1950, to, 1999, compared, nutritional, analysis, of, vegetables, done, in, 1950, and, in, 1999, and, found, substantial, decreases, in, six, of, 13, nutrients, measured, including, 6, of, protein, and, 38, of, riboflavin, reductions, in, calcium, phosphorus, iron, and, ascorbic, acid, were, also, found, the, study, conducted, at, the, biochemical, institute, university, of, texas, at, austin, concluded, in, summary, we, suggest, that, any, real, declines, are, generally, most, easily, explained, by, changes, in, cultivated, varieties, between, 1950, and, 1999, in, which, there, may, be, trade, offs, between, yield, and, nutrient, content, plant, breeding, can, contribute, to, global, food, security, as, it, is, a, cost, effective, tool, for, increasing, nutritional, value, of, forage, and, crops, improvements, in, nutritional, value, for, forage, crops, from, the, use, of, analytical, chemistry, and, rumen, fermentation, technology, have, been, recorded, since, 1960, this, science, and, technology, gave, breeders, the, ability, to, screen, thousands, of, samples, within, a, small, amount, of, time, meaning, breeders, could, identify, a, high, performing, hybrid, quicker, the, genetic, improvement, was, mainly, in, vitro, dry, matter, digestibility, ivdmd, resulting, in, 0, 7, 2, 5, increase, at, just, 1, increase, in, ivdmd, a, single, bos, taurus, also, known, as, beef, cattle, reported, 3, 2, increase, in, daily, gains, this, improvement, indicates, plant, breeding, is, an, essential, tool, in, gearing, future, agriculture, to, perform, at, a, more, advanced, level, with, an, increasing, population, the, production, of, food, needs, to, increase, with, it, it, is, estimated, that, a, 70, increase, in, food, production, is, needed, by, 2050, in, order, to, meet, the, declaration, of, the, world, summit, on, food, security, but, with, the, degradation, of, agricultural, land, simply, planting, more, crops, is, no, longer, a, viable, option, new, varieties, of, plants, can, in, some, cases, be, developed, through, plant, breeding, that, generate, an, increase, of, yield, without, relying, on, an, increase, in, land, area, an, example, of, this, can, be, seen, in, asia, where, food, production, per, capita, has, increased, twofold, this, has, been, achieved, through, not, only, the, use, of, fertilisers, but, through, the, use, of, better, crops, that, have, been, specifically, designed, for, the, area, some, critics, of, organic, agriculture, claim, it, is, too, low, yielding, to, be, a, viable, alternative, to, conventional, agriculture, in, situations, when, that, poor, performance, may, be, the, result, in, part, of, growing, poorly, adapted, varieties, it, is, estimated, that, over, 95, of, organic, agriculture, is, based, on, conventionally, adapted, varieties, even, though, the, production, environments, found, in, organic, vs, conventional, farming, systems, are, vastly, different, due, to, their, distinctive, management, practices, most, notably, organic, farmers, have, fewer, inputs, available, than, conventional, growers, to, control, their, production, environments, breeding, varieties, specifically, adapted, to, the, unique, conditions, of, organic, agriculture, is, critical, for, this, sector, to, realize, its, full, potential, this, requires, selection, for, traits, such, as, currently, few, breeding, programs, are, directed, at, organic, agriculture, and, until, recently, those, that, did, address, this, sector, have, generally, relied, on, indirect, selection, i, e, selection, in, conventional, environments, for, traits, considered, important, for, organic, agriculture, however, because, the, difference, between, organic, and, conventional, environments, is, large, a, given, genotype, may, perform, very, differently, in, each, environment, due, to, an, interaction, between, genes, and, the, environment, see, gene, environment, interaction, if, this, interaction, is, severe, enough, an, important, trait, required, for, the, organic, environment, may, not, be, revealed, in, the, conventional, environment, which, can, result, in, the, selection, of, poorly, adapted, individuals, to, ensure, the, most, adapted, varieties, are, identified, advocates, of, organic, breeding, now, promote, the, use, of, direct, selection, i, e, selection, in, the, target, environment, for, many, agronomic, traits, there, are, many, classical, and, modern, breeding, techniques, that, can, be, utilized, for, crop, improvement, in, organic, agriculture, despite, the, ban, on, genetically, modified, organisms, for, instance, controlled, crosses, between, individuals, allow, desirable, genetic, variation, to, be, recombined, and, transferred, to, seed, progeny, via, natural, processes, marker, assisted, selection, can, also, be, employed, as, a, diagnostics, tool, to, facilitate, selection, of, progeny, who, possess, the, desired, trait, s, greatly, speeding, up, the, breeding, process, this, technique, has, proven, particularly, useful, for, the, introgression, of, resistance, genes, into, new, backgrounds, as, well, as, the, efficient, selection, of, many, resistance, genes, pyramided, into, a, single, individual, molecular, markers, are, not, currently, available, for, many, important, traits, especially, complex, ones, controlled, by, many, genes
