cyperus, papyrus, a, wetland, sedge, papyrus, plural, papyri, or, papyruses, can, also, refer, to, a, document, written, on, sheets, of, such, material, joined, side, by, side, and, rolled, up, into, a, scroll, an, early, form, of, a, book, papyrus, was, first, known, to, have, been, used, in, egypt, at, least, as, far, back, as, the, first, dynasty, as, the, papyrus, plant, was, once, abundant, across, the, nile, delta, it, was, also, used, throughout, the, mediterranean, region, apart, from, writing, material, ancient, egyptians, employed, papyrus, in, the, construction, of, other, artifacts, such, as, reed, boats, mats, rope, sandals, and, baskets, papyrus, was, first, manufactured, in, egypt, as, far, back, as, the, third, millennium, bce, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, papyrus, was, excavated, in, 2012, and, 2013, at, wadi, al, jarf, an, ancient, egyptian, harbor, located, on, the, red, sea, coast, these, documents, the, diary, of, merer, date, from, c, 2560, 2550, bce, end, of, the, reign, of, khufu, the, papyrus, rolls, describe, the, last, years, of, building, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, for, multiple, millennia, papyrus, was, commonly, rolled, into, scrolls, as, a, form, of, storage, however, at, some, point, late, in, its, history, papyrus, began, being, collected, together, in, the, form, of, codices, akin, to, the, modern, book, this, may, have, been, mimicing, the, book, form, of, codicies, created, with, parchment, early, christian, writers, soon, adopted, the, codex, form, and, in, the, greco, roman, world, it, became, common, to, cut, sheets, from, papyrus, rolls, to, form, codices, codices, were, an, improvement, on, the, papyrus, scroll, as, the, papyrus, was, not, pliable, enough, to, fold, without, cracking, and, a, long, roll, or, scroll, was, required, to, create, large, volume, texts, papyrus, had, the, advantage, of, being, relatively, cheap, and, easy, to, produce, but, it, was, fragile, and, susceptible, to, both, moisture, and, excessive, dryness, unless, the, papyrus, was, of, perfect, quality, the, writing, surface, was, irregular, and, the, range, of, media, that, could, be, used, was, also, limited, papyrus, was, gradually, overtaken, in, europe, by, a, rival, writing, surface, that, rose, in, prominence, known, as, parchment, which, was, made, from, animal, skins, by, the, beginning, of, the, fourth, century, a, d, the, most, important, books, began, to, be, manufactured, in, parchment, and, works, worth, preserving, were, transferred, from, papyrus, to, parchment, parchment, had, significant, advantages, over, papyrus, including, higher, durability, in, moist, climates, and, being, more, conducive, to, writing, on, both, sides, of, the, surface, the, main, advantage, of, papyrus, had, been, its, cheaper, raw, material, the, papyrus, plant, is, easy, to, cultivate, in, a, suitable, climate, and, produces, more, writing, material, than, animal, hides, the, most, expensive, books, made, from, foetal, vellum, would, take, up, to, dozens, of, bovine, fetuses, to, produce, however, as, trade, networks, declined, the, availability, of, papyrus, outside, the, range, of, the, papyrus, plant, became, limited, and, it, thus, lost, its, cost, advantage, papyrus, last, appearance, in, the, merovingian, chancery, was, with, a, document, from, 692, a, d, though, it, was, known, in, gaul, until, the, middle, of, the, following, century, the, latest, certain, dates, for, the, use, of, papyrus, in, europe, are, 1057, for, a, papal, decree, typically, conservative, all, papal, bulls, were, on, papyrus, until, 1022, under, pope, victor, ii, and, 1087, for, an, arabic, document, its, use, in, egypt, continued, until, it, was, replaced, by, less, expensive, paper, introduced, by, the, islamic, world, which, originally, learned, of, it, from, the, chinese, by, the, 12th, century, parchment, and, paper, were, in, use, in, the, byzantine, empire, but, papyrus, was, still, an, option, until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, only, some, isolated, documents, written, on, papyrus, were, known, and, museums, simply, showed, them, as, curiosities, they, did, not, contain, literary, works, the, first, modern, discovery, of, papyri, rolls, was, made, at, herculaneum, in, 1752, until, then, the, only, papyri, known, had, been, a, few, surviving, from, medieval, times, scholarly, investigations, began, with, the, dutch, historian, caspar, jacob, christiaan, reuvens, 1793, 1835, he, wrote, about, the, content, of, the, leyden, papyrus, published, in, 1830, the, first, publication, has, been, credited, to, the, british, scholar, charles, wycliffe, goodwin, 1817, 1878, who, published, for, the, cambridge, antiquarian, society, one, of, the, papyri, graecae, magicae, v, translated, into, english, with, commentary, in, 1853, papyrus, was, made, in, several, qualities, and, prices, pliny, the, elder, and, isidore, of, seville, described, six, variations, of, papyrus, that, were, sold, in, the, roman, market, of, the, day, these, were, graded, by, quality, based, on, how, fine, firm, white, and, smooth, the, writing, surface, was, grades, ranged, from, the, superfine, augustan, which, was, produced, in, sheets, of, 13, digits, 10, inches, wide, to, the, least, expensive, and, most, coarse, measuring, six, digits, four, inches, wide, materials, deemed, unusable, for, writing, or, less, than, six, digits, were, considered, commercial, quality, and, were, pasted, edge, to, edge, to, be, used, only, for, wrapping, the, english, word, papyrus, derives, via, latin, from, greek, papyros, a, loanword, of, unknown, perhaps, pre, greek, origin, greek, has, a, second, word, for, it, byblos, said, to, derive,

herculaneum, ripples, of, expectation, spread, among, the, learned, men, of, the, time, however, since, these, papyri, were, badly, charred, their, unscrolling, and, deciphering, are, still, going, on, today, papyrus, was, made, from, the, stem, of, the, papyrus, plant, cyperus, papyrus, the, outer, rind, was, first, removed, and, the, sticky, fibrous, inner, pith, is, cut, lengthwise, into, thin, strips, about, 40, cm, 16, in, long, the, strips, were, then, placed, side, by, side, on, a, hard, surface, with, their, edges, slightly, overlapping, and, then, another, layer, of, strips, is, laid, on, top, at, right, angles, the, strips, may, have, been, soaked, in, water, long, enough, for, decomposition, to, begin, perhaps, increasing, adhesion, but, this, is, not, certain, the, two, layers, possibly, were, glued, together, while, still, moist, the, two, layers, were, hammered, together, mashing, the, layers, into, a, single, sheet, the, sheet, was, then, dried, under, pressure, after, drying, the, sheet, was, polished, with, a, rounded, object, possibly, a, stone, seashell, or, round, hardwood, sheets, or, mollema, could, be, cut, to, fit, the, obligatory, size, or, glued, together, to, create, a, longer, roll, the, point, where, the, mollema, are, joined, with, glue, is, called, the, kollesis, a, wooden, stick, would, be, attached, to, the, last, sheet, in, a, roll, making, it, easier, to, handle, to, form, the, long, strip, scrolls, required, several, such, sheets, were, united, and, placed, so, all, the, horizontal, fibres, parallel, with, the, roll, s, length, were, on, one, side, and, all, the, vertical, fibres, on, the, other, normally, texts, were, first, written, on, the, recto, the, lines, following, the, fibres, parallel, to, the, long, edges, of, the, scroll, secondarily, papyrus, was, often, reused, writing, across, the, fibres, on, the, verso, one, source, used, for, determining, the, method, by, which, papyrus, was, created, in, antiquity, is, through, the, examination, of, tombs, in, the, ancient, egyptian, city, of, thebes, which, housed, a, necropolis, containing, many, murals, displaying, the, process, of, papyrus, making, the, roman, commander, pliny, the, elder, also, describes, the, methods, of, preparing, papyrus, in, his, naturalis, historia, 5, in, a, dry, climate, like, that, of, egypt, papyrus, is, stable, formed, as, it, is, of, highly, rot, resistant, cellulose, but, storage, in, humid, conditions, can, result, in, molds, attacking, and, destroying, the, material, library, papyrus, rolls, were, stored, in,

of, papyrus, have, been, made, since, the, mid, 18th, century, scottish, explorer, james, bruce, experimented, in, the, late, 18th, century, with, papyrus, plants, from, sudan, for, papyrus, had,

the, 1920s, when, egyptologist, battiscombe, gunn, lived, in, maadi, outside, cairo, he, experimented, with, the, manufacture, of, papyrus, growing, the, plant, in, his, garden, he, beat, the, sliced, papyrus, stalks, between, two, layers, of, linen, and, produced, successful, examples, of, papyrus, one, of, which, was, exhibited, in, the, egyptian, museum, in, cairo, the, modern, technique, of, papyrus, production, used, in, egypt, for, the, tourist, trade, was, developed, in, 1962, by, the, egyptian, engineer, hassan, ragab, using, plants, that, had, been, reintroduced, into, egypt, in, 1872, from, france, both, sicily, and, egypt, have, centres, of, limited, papyrus, production, papyrus, is, still, used, by, communities, living, in, the, vicinity, of, swamps, to, the, extent, that,
