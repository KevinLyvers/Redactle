a, wing, is, a, type, of, fin, that, produces, lift, while, moving, through, air, or, some, other, fluid, accordingly, wings, have, streamlined, cross, sections, that, are, subject, to, aerodynamic, forces, and, act, as, airfoils, a, wing, s, aerodynamic, efficiency, is, expressed, as, its, lift, to, drag, ratio, the, lift, a, wing, generates, at, a, given, speed, and, angle, of, attack, can, be, one, to, two, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, total, drag, on, the, wing, a, high, lift, to, drag, ratio, requires, a, significantly, smaller, thrust, to, propel, the, wings, through, the, air, at, sufficient, lift, lifting, structures, used, in, water, include, various, foils, like, hydrofoils, hydrodynamics, is, the, governing, science, rather, than, aerodynamics, applications, of, underwater, foils, occur, in, hydroplanes, sailboats, and, submarines, for, many, centuries, the, word, wing, from, the, old, norse, v, ngr, referred, mainly, to, the, foremost, limbs, of, birds, in, addition, to, the, architectural, aisle, but, in, recent, centuries, the, word, s, meaning, has, extended, to, include, lift, producing, appendages, of, insects, bats, pterosaurs, boomerangs, some, sail, boats, and, inverted, airfoils, on, race, cars, that, generate, a, downward, force, to, increase, traction, the, design, and, analysis, of, the, wings, of, aircraft, is, one, of, the, principal, applications, of, the, science, of, aerodynamics, which, is, a, branch, of, fluid, mechanics, in, principle, the, properties, of, the, airflow, around, any, moving, object, can, be, found, by, solving, the, navier, stokes, equations, of, fluid, dynamics, however, except, for, simple, geometries, these, equations, are, notoriously, difficult, to, solve, and, simpler, equations, are, used, for, a, wing, to, produce, lift, it, must, be, oriented, at, a, suitable, angle, of, attack, when, that, occurs, the, wing, deflects, the, airflow, downwards, as, it, passes, the, wing, since, the, wing, exerts, a, force, on, the, air, to, change, its, direction, the, air, must, also, exert, an, equal, and, opposite, force, on, the, wing, an, airfoil, american, english, or, aerofoil, british, english, is, the, shape, of, a, wing, blade, of, a, propeller, rotor, or, turbine, or, sail, as, seen, in, cross, section, wings, with, an, asymmetrical, cross, section, are, the, norm, in, subsonic, flight, wings, with, a, symmetrical, cross, section, can, also, generate, lift, by, using, a, positive, angle, of, attack, to, deflect, air, downward, symmetrical, airfoils, have, higher, stalling, speeds, than, cambered, airfoils, of, the, same, wing, area, but, are, used, in, aerobatic, aircraft, as, they, provide, practical, performance, whether, the, aircraft, is, upright, or, inverted, another, example, comes, from, sailboats, where, the, sail, is, a, thin, membrane, with, no, path, length, difference, between, one, side, and, the, other, for, flight, speeds, near, the, speed, of, sound, transonic, flight, airfoils, with, complex, asymmetrical, shapes, are, used, to, minimize, the, drastic, increase, in, drag, associated, with, airflow, near, the, speed, of, sound, such, airfoils, called, supercritical, airfoils, are, flat, on, top, and, curved, on, the, bottom, aircraft, wings, may, feature, some, of, the, following, aircraft, wings, may, have, various, devices, such, as, flaps, or, slats, that, the, pilot, uses, to, modify, the, shape, and, surface, area, of, the, wing, to, change, its, operating, characteristics, in, flight, wings, may, have, other, minor, independent, surfaces, besides, fixed, wing, aircraft, applications, for, wing, shapes, include, in, nature, wings, have, evolved, in, insects, pterosaurs, dinosaurs, birds, scansoriopterygidae, and, mammals, bats, as, a, means, of, locomotion, various, species, of, penguins, and, other, flighted, or, flightless, water, birds, such, as, auks, cormorants, guillemots, shearwaters, eider, and, scoter, ducks, and, diving, petrels, are, avid, swimmers, using, their, wings, to, propel, themselves, through, water, in, 1948, francis, rogallo, invented, a, kite, like, tensile, wing, supported, by, inflated, or, rigid, struts, which, ushered, in, new, possibilities, for, aircraft, near, that, time, domina, jalbert, invented, flexible, un, sparred, ram, air, airfoiled, thick, wings, these, two, new, branches, of, wings, have, been, since, extensively, studied, and, applied, in, new, branches, of, aircraft, especially, altering, the, personal, recreational, aviation, landscape
