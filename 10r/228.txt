https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueduct_(water_supply)
an, aqueduct, is, a, watercourse, constructed, to, carry, water, from, a, source, to, a, distribution, point, far, away, in, modern, engineering, the, term, aqueduct, is, used, for, any, system, of, pipes, ditches, canals, tunnels, and, other, structures, used, for, this, purpose, the, term, aqueduct, also, often, refers, specifically, to, a, bridge, carrying, an, artificial, watercourse, aqueducts, were, used, in, ancient, greece, the, ancient, near, east, ancient, rome, ancient, aztec, and, ancient, inca, the, simplest, aqueducts, are, small, ditches, cut, into, the, earth, much, larger, channels, may, be, used, in, modern, aqueducts, aqueducts, sometimes, run, for, some, or, all, of, their, path, through, tunnels, constructed, underground, modern, aqueducts, may, also, use, pipelines, historically, agricultural, societies, have, constructed, aqueducts, to, irrigate, crops, and, supply, large, cities, with, drinking, water, the, word, aqueduct, is, derived, from, the, latin, words, aqua, water, and, ductus, led, or, guided, although, particularly, associated, with, the, romans, aqueducts, were, devised, much, earlier, in, greece, the, near, east, nile, valley, and, indian, subcontinent, where, peoples, such, as, the, egyptians, and, harappans, built, sophisticated, irrigation, systems, the, aztecs, and, incans, also, built, such, systems, independently, later, roman, style, aqueducts, were, used, as, early, as, the, 7th, century, bc, when, the, assyrians, built, an, 80, km, long, limestone, aqueduct, which, included, a, 10, m, high, section, to, cross, a, 300, m, wide, valley, to, carry, water, to, their, capital, city, nineveh, although, particularly, associated, with, the, romans, aqueducts, were, likely, first, used, by, the, minoans, around, 2000, bce, the, minoans, had, developed, what, was, then, an, extremely, advanced, irrigation, system, including, several, aqueducts, the, indian, subcontinent, is, believed, to, have, some, of, the, earliest, aqueducts, evidence, can, be, found, at, the, sites, of, present, day, hampi, karnataka, the, massive, aqueducts, near, tungabhadra, river, supplying, irrigation, water, were, once, 15, miles, 24, km, long, the, waterways, supplied, water, to, royal, bath, tubs, in, oman, from, the, iron, age, in, salut, bat, and, other, sites, a, system, of, underground, aqueducts, called, falaj, or, qan, ts, were, constructed, a, series, of, well, like, vertical, shafts, connected, by, gently, sloping, horizontal, tunnels, there, are, three, types, of, falaj, these, enabled, large, scale, agriculture, to, flourish, in, a, dry, land, environment, in, persia, starting, around, 3000, years, ago, a, system, of, underground, aqueducts, called, qan, ts, were, constructed, a, series, of, well, like, vertical, shafts, connected, by, gently, sloping, tunnels, this, technique, throughout, petra, jordan, the, nabataean, engineers, took, advantage, of, every, natural, spring, and, every, winter, downpour, to, channel, water, where, it, was, needed, they, constructed, aqueducts, and, piping, systems, that, allowed, water, to, flow, across, mountains, through, gorges, and, into, the, temples, homes, and, gardens, of, petra, s, citizens, walking, through, the, siq, one, can, easily, spot, the, remains, of, channels, that, directed, water, to, the, city, center, as, well, as, durable, retention, dams, that, kept, powerful, flood, waters, at, bay, on, the, island, of, samos, the, tunnel, of, eupalinos, was, built, during, the, reign, of, polycrates, 538, 522, bc, it, is, considered, an, underground, aqueduct, and, brought, fresh, water, to, pythagoreion, for, roughly, a, thousand, years, roman, aqueducts, were, built, in, all, parts, of, the, roman, empire, from, germany, to, africa, and, especially, in, the, city, of, rome, where, they, totalled, over, 415, kilometres, 258, mi, the, aqueducts, supplied, fresh, water, to, public, baths, and, for, drinking, water, in, large, cities, across, the, empire, and, set, a, standard, of, engineering, that, was, not, surpassed, for, more, than, a, thousand, years, bridges, built, in, stone, with, multiple, arches, were, a, distinctive, feature, of, roman, aqueducts, and, hence, the, term, aqueduct, is, often, applied, specifically, to, a, bridge, for, carrying, water, near, the, peruvian, town, of, nazca, an, ancient, pre, columbian, system, of, aqueducts, called, puquios, were, built, and, are, still, in, use, today, they, were, made, of, intricately, placed, stones, a, construction, material, widely, used, by, the, nazca, culture, the, time, period, in, which, they, were, constructed, is, still, debated, but, some, evidence, supports, circa, a, d, 540, 552, in, response, to, drought, periods, in, the, region, the, guayabo, national, monument, of, costa, rica, a, park, covering, the, largest, archaeological, site, in, the, country, contains, a, system, of, aqueducts, the, complex, network, of, uncovered, and, covered, aqueducts, still, functions, well, the, aqueducts, are, constructed, from, rounded, river, stones, which, are, mostly, made, of, volcanic, rock, the, civilization, that, constructed, the, aqueduct, system, remains, a, mystery, to, archaeologists, it, is, suspected, that, guayabo, s, aqueducts, sat, at, a, point, of, ancient, cultural, confluence, between, aztecs, mayans, and, incas, when, europeans, saw, the, aztec, capital, tenochtitlan, early, in, the, 16th, century, the, city, was, watered, by, two, aqueducts, one, of, these, chapultepec, aqueduct, built, c, 1420, was, rebuilt, by, the, spanish, almost, three, hundred, years, later, originally, tracing, part, of, its, path, over, now, gone, lake, texcoco, only, a, fragment, remains, in, mexico, city, today, extensive, usage, of, elaborate, aqueducts, have, been, found, to, have, been, used, in, ancient, sri, lanka, the, best, example, is, the, yoda, ela, or, jaya, ganga, an, 87, kilometres, 54, mi, long, water, canal, carrying, excess, water, between, two, artificial, reservoirs, with, a, gradient, of, 10, to, 20, cm, per, kilometer, during, the, fifth, century, ad, however, the, ancient, engineering, methods, in, calculating, the, exact, elevation, between, the, two, reservoirs, and, the, exact, gradient, of, the, canal, to, such, fine, precision, had, been, lost, with, the, fall, of, the, civilization, in, 13th, century, modern, aqueducts, are, a, central, part, of, many, countries, water, distribution, infrastructure, the, united, states, aqueducts, are, some, of, the, world, s, largest, the, catskill, aqueduct, carries, water, to, new, york, city, over, a, distance, of, 120, miles, 190, km, but, is, dwarfed, by, aqueducts, in, the, far, west, of, the, country, most, notably, the, 242, mile, 389, km, colorado, river, aqueduct, which, supplies, the, los, angeles, area, with, water, from, the, colorado, river, nearly, 250, miles, to, the, east, and, the, 701, 5, mile, 1, 129, 0, km, california, aqueduct, which, runs, from, the, sacramento, san, joaquin, river, delta, to, lake, perris, the, central, arizona, project, is, the, largest, and, most, expensive, aqueduct, constructed, in, the, united, states, it, stretches, 336, miles, from, its, source, near, parker, arizona, to, the, metropolitan, areas, of, phoenix, and, tucson, an, aqueduct, in, new, zealand, the, oamaru, borough, race, was, constructed, in, the, late, 19th, century, to, deliver, water, and, water, power, about, 50, km, from, the, waitaki, river, at, kurow, to, the, coastal, town, of, oamaru, in, spain, the, tagus, segura, water, transfer, system, of, aqueducts, opened, in, 1979, and, transports, water, 286, kilometres, 178, mi, from, north, to, south, in, china, the, south, north, water, transfer, project, aims, to, connect, the, yangtze, river, basin, to, beijing, through, three, separate, systems, the, project, will, reuse, part, of, the, grand, canal, of, china, the, simplest, aqueducts, are, small, ditches, cut, into, the, earth, much, larger, channels, may, be, used, in, modern, aqueducts, for, instance, the, central, arizona, project, uses, 7, 3, m, 24, ft, wide, channels, a, major, factor, in, the, design, of, all, open, channels, is, its, gradient, a, higher, gradient, allows, a, smaller, channel, to, carry, the, same, amount, of, water, as, a, larger, channel, with, a, lower, gradient, but, increases, the, potential, of, the, water, to, damage, the, aqueduct, s, structure, a, typical, roman, aqueduct, had, a, gradient, of, about, 1, 4800, a, constructed, functional, rill, is, a, small, canal, or, aqueduct, of, stone, brick, concrete, or, other, lining, material, usually, rectilinear, in, cross, section, for, water, transportation, from, a, source, such, as, a, river, spring, reservoir, qanat, or, aqueduct, for, domestic, consumption, or, agricultural, irrigation, of, crop, land, uses, rills, were, traditionally, used, in, middle, eastern, and, mediterranean, climate, cultures, of, ancient, and, historical, eras, and, other, climates, and, continents, worldwide, they, are, distinguished, from, a, water, ditch, by, being, lined, to, reduce, absorption, losses, and, to, increase, durability, the, falaj, irrigation, system, at, the, al, ain, oasis, in, present, day, abu, dhabi, emirate, uses, rills, as, part, of, its, qanat, water, system, sometimes, in, the, spanish, language, they, are, called, acequias, rills, are, also, used, for, aesthetic, purposes, in, landscape, design, rills, are, used, as, narrow, channels, of, water, inset, into, the, pavement, of, a, garden, as, linear, water, features, and, often, tiled, and, part, of, a, fountain, design, the, historical, origins, are, from, paradise, garden, religious, images, that, first, translated, into, ancient, persian, gardens, rills, were, later, exceptionally, developed, in, the, moorish, spanish, gardens, of, al, andalus, such, as, at, the, alhambra, in, granada, and, also, in, other, islamic, gardens, cultures, and, countries, early, 20th, century, examples, are, in, the, mar, a, luisa, park, gardens, in, seville, spain, and, at, the, casa, del, herrero, gardens, in, montecito, california, aqueducts, sometimes, run, for, some, or, all, of, their, path, through, tunnels, constructed, underground, a, version, of, this, common, in, north, africa, and, central, asia, that, has, vertical, wells, at, regular, intervals, is, called, a, qanat, one, historic, example, found, in, syria, the, qanat, firaun, extends, over, 100, kilometers, modern, aqueducts, may, also, make, extensive, use, of, pipelines, pipelines, are, useful, for, transporting, water, over, long, distances, when, it, needs, to, move, over, hills, or, where, open, channels, are, poor, choices, due, to, considerations, of, evaporation, freezing, pollution, or, environmental, impact, they, can, also, be, used, to, carry, treated, water, historically, agricultural, societies, have, constructed, aqueducts, to, irrigate, crops, archimedes, invented, the, water, screw, to, raise, water, for, use, in, irrigation, of, croplands, another, use, for, aqueducts, is, to, supply, large, cities, with, drinking, water, they, also, help, drought, prone, areas, with, water, supply, some, of, the, roman, aqueducts, still, supply, water, to, rome, today, in, california, united, states, three, large, aqueducts, supply, water, over, hundreds, of, miles, to, the, los, angeles, area, two, are, from, the, owens, river, area, and, a, third, is, from, the, colorado, river, in, modern, civil, engineering, projects, detailed, study, and, analysis, of, open, channel, flow, is, commonly, required, to, support, flood, control, irrigation, systems, and, large, water, supply, systems, when, an, aqueduct, rather, than, a, pipeline, is, the, preferred, solution, in, the, past, aqueducts, often, had, channels, made, of, earth, or, other, porous, materials, but, significant, amounts, of, water, are, lost, through, such, unlined, aqueducts, as, water, gets, increasingly, scarce, these, canals, are, being, lined, with, concrete, polymers, or, impermeable, soil, in, some, cases, a, new, aqueduct, is, built, alongside, the, old, one, because, it, cannot, be, shut, down, during, construction
