information, technology, it, is, a, set, of, related, fields, that, encompass, computer, systems, software, programming, languages, and, data, and, information, processing, and, storage, it, forms, part, of, information, and, communications, technology, ict, an, information, technology, system, it, system, is, generally, an, information, system, a, communications, system, or, more, specifically, speaking, a, computer, system, including, all, hardware, software, and, peripheral, equipment, operated, by, a, limited, group, of, it, users, and, an, it, project, usually, refers, to, the, commissioning, and, implementation, of, an, it, system, it, systems, play, a, vital, role, in, facilitating, efficient, data, management, enhancing, communication, networks, and, supporting, organizational, processes, across, various, industries, successful, it, projects, require, meticulous, planning, seamless, integration, and, ongoing, maintenance, to, ensure, optimal, functionality, and, alignment, with, organizational, objectives, although, humans, have, been, storing, retrieving, manipulating, and, communicating, information, since, the, earliest, writing, systems, were, developed, the, term, information, technology, in, its, modern, sense, first, appeared, in, a, 1958, article, published, in, the, harvard, business, review, authors, harold, j, leavitt, and, thomas, l, whisler, commented, that, the, new, technology, does, not, yet, have, a, single, established, name, we, shall, call, it, information, technology, it, their, definition, consists, of, three, categories, techniques, for, processing, the, application, of, statistical, and, mathematical, methods, to, decision, making, and, the, simulation, of, higher, order, thinking, through, computer, programs, the, term, is, commonly, used, as, a, synonym, for, computers, and, computer, networks, but, it, also, encompasses, other, information, distribution, technologies, such, as, television, and, telephones, several, products, or, services, within, an, economy, are, associated, with, information, technology, including, computer, hardware, software, electronics, semiconductors, internet, telecom, equipment, and, e, commerce, based, on, the, storage, and, processing, technologies, employed, it, is, possible, to, distinguish, four, distinct, phases, of, it, development, pre, mechanical, 3000, bc, 1450, ad, mechanical, 1450, 1840, electromechanical, 1840, 1940, and, electronic, 1940, to, present, information, technology, is, a, branch, of, computer, science, defined, as, the, study, of, procedures, structures, and, the, processing, of, various, types, of, data, as, this, field, continues, to, evolve, globally, its, priority, and, importance, have, grown, leading, to, the, introduction, of, computer, science, related, courses, in, k, 12, education, ideas, of, computer, science, were, first, mentioned, before, the, 1950s, under, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, and, harvard, university, where, they, had, discussed, and, began, thinking, of, computer, circuits, and, numerical, calculations, as, time, went, on, the, field, of, information, technology, and, computer, science, became, more, complex, and, was, able, to, handle, the, processing, of, more, data, scholarly, articles, began, to, be, published, from, different, organizations, looking, at, early, computing, alan, turing, j, presper, eckert, and, john, mauchly, were, considered, some, of, the, major, pioneers, of, computer, technology, in, the, mid, 1900s, giving, them, such, credit, for, their, developments, most, of, their, efforts, were, focused, on, designing, the, first, digital, computer, along, with, that, topics, such, as, artificial, intelligence, began, to, be, brought, up, as, turing, was, beginning, to, question, such, technology, of, the, time, period, devices, have, been, used, to, aid, computation, for, thousands, of, years, probably, initially, in, the, form, of, a, tally, stick, the, antikythera, mechanism, dating, from, about, the, beginning, of, the, first, century, bc, is, generally, considered, the, earliest, known, mechanical, analog, computer, and, the, earliest, known, geared, mechanism, comparable, geared, devices, did, not, emerge, in, europe, until, the, 16th, century, and, it, was, not, until, 1645, that, the, first, mechanical, calculator, capable, of, performing, the, four, basic, arithmetical, operations, was, developed, electronic, computers, using, either, relays, or, valves, began, to, appear, in, the, early, 1940s, the, electromechanical, zuse, z3, completed, in, 1941, was, the, world, s, first, programmable, computer, and, by, modern, standards, one, of, the, first, machines, that, could, be, considered, a, complete, computing, machine, during, the, second, world, war, colossus, developed, the, first, electronic, digital, computer, to, decrypt, german, messages, although, it, was, programmable, it, was, not, general, purpose, being, designed, to, perform, only, a, single, task, it, also, lacked, the, ability, to, store, its, program, in, memory, programming, was, carried, out, using, plugs, and, switches, to, alter, the, internal, wiring, the, first, recognizably, modern, electronic, digital, stored, program, computer, was, the, manchester, baby, which, ran, its, first, program, on, 21, june, 1948, the, development, of, transistors, in, the, late, 1940s, at, bell, laboratories, allowed, a, new, generation, of, computers, to, be, designed, with, greatly, reduced, power, consumption, the, first, commercially, available, stored, program, computer, the, ferranti, mark, i, contained, 4050, valves, and, had, a, power, consumption, of, 25, kilowatts, by, comparison, the, first, transistorized, computer, developed, at, the, university, of, manchester, and, operational, by, november, 1953, consumed, only, 150, watts, in, its, final, version, several, other, breakthroughs, in, semiconductor, technology, include, the, integrated, circuit, ic, invented, by, jack, kilby, at, texas, instruments, and, robert, noyce, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1959, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, invented, by, mohamed, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, at, bell, laboratories, in, 1959, and, the, microprocessor, invented, by, ted, hoff, federico, faggin, masatoshi, shima, and, stanley, mazor, at, intel, in, 1971, these, important, inventions, led, to, the, development, of, the, personal, computer, pc, in, the, 1970s, and, the, emergence, of, information, and, communications, technology, ict, by, the, year, of, 1984, according, to, the, national, westminster, bank, quarterly, review, the, term, information, technology, had, been, redefined, as, the, development, of, cable, television, was, made, possible, by, the, convergence, of, telecommunications, and, computing, technology, generally, known, in, britain, as, information, technology, we, then, begin, to, see, the, appearance, of, the, term, in, 1990, contained, within, documents, for, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, innovations, in, technology, have, already, revolutionized, the, world, by, the, twenty, first, century, as, people, were, able, to, access, different, online, services, this, has, changed, the, workforce, drastically, as, thirty, percent, of, u, s, workers, were, already, in, careers, in, this, profession, 136, 9, million, people, were, personally, connected, to, the, internet, which, was, equivalent, to, 51, million, households, along, with, the, internet, new, types, of, technology, were, also, being, introduced, across, the, globe, which, has, improved, efficiency, and, made, things, easier, across, the, globe, along, with, technology, revolutionizing, society, millions, of, processes, could, be, done, in, seconds, innovations, in, communication, were, also, crucial, as, people, began, to, rely, on, the, computer, to, communicate, through, telephone, lines, and, cable, the, introduction, of, the, email, was, considered, revolutionary, as, companies, in, one, part, of, the, world, could, communicate, by, e, mail, with, suppliers, and, buyers, in, another, part, of, the, world, not, only, personally, computers, and, technology, have, also, revolutionized, the, marketing, industry, resulting, in, more, buyers, of, their, products, during, the, year, of, 2002, americans, exceeded, 28, billion, in, goods, just, over, the, internet, alone, while, e, commerce, a, decade, later, resulted, in, 289, billion, in, sales, and, as, computers, are, rapidly, becoming, more, sophisticated, by, the, day, they, are, becoming, more, used, as, people, are, becoming, more, reliant, on, them, during, the, twenty, first, century, early, electronic, computers, such, as, colossus, made, use, of, punched, tape, a, long, strip, of, paper, on, which, data, was, represented, by, a, series, of, holes, a, technology, now, obsolete, electronic, data, storage, which, is, used, in, modern, computers, dates, from, world, war, ii, when, a, form, of, delay, line, memory, was, developed, to, remove, the, clutter, from, radar, signals, the, first, practical, application, of, which, was, the, mercury, delay, line, the, first, random, access, digital, storage, device, was, the, williams, tube, which, was, based, on, a, standard, cathode, ray, tube, however, the, information, stored, in, it, and, delay, line, memory, was, volatile, in, the, fact, that, it, had, to, be, continuously, refreshed, and, thus, was, lost, once, power, was, removed, the, earliest, form, of, non, volatile, computer, storage, was, the, magnetic, drum, invented, in, 1932, and, used, in, the, ferranti, mark, 1, the, world, s, first, commercially, available, general, purpose, electronic, computer, ibm, introduced, the, first, hard, disk, drive, in, 1956, as, a, component, of, their, 305, ramac, computer, system, 6, most, digital, data, today, is, still, stored, magnetically, on, hard, disks, or, optically, on, media, such, as, cd, roms, 4, 5, until, 2002, most, information, was, stored, on, analog, devices, but, that, year, digital, storage, capacity, exceeded, analog, for, the, first, time, as, of, 2007, almost, 94, of, the, data, stored, worldwide, was, held, digitally, 52, on, hard, disks, 28, on, optical, devices, and, 11, on, digital, magnetic, tape, it, has, been, estimated, that, the, worldwide, capacity, to, store, information, on, electronic, devices, grew, from, less, than, 3, exabytes, in, 1986, to, 295, exabytes, in, 2007, doubling, roughly, every, 3, years, database, management, systems, dms, emerged, in, the, 1960s, to, address, the, problem, of, storing, and, retrieving, large, amounts, of, data, accurately, and, quickly, an, early, such, system, was, ibm, s, information, management, system, ims, which, is, still, widely, deployed, more, than, 50, years, later, ims, stores, data, hierarchically, but, in, the, 1970s, ted, codd, proposed, an, alternative, relational, storage, model, based, on, set, theory, and, predicate, logic, and, the, familiar, concepts, of, tables, rows, and, columns, in, 1981, the, first, commercially, available, relational, database, management, system, rdbms, was, released, by, oracle, all, dms, consist, of, components, they, allow, the, data, they, store, to, be, accessed, simultaneously, by, many, users, while, maintaining, its, integrity, all, databases, are, common, in, one, point, that, the, structure, of, the, data, they, contain, is, defined, and, stored, separately, from, the, data, itself, in, a, database, schema, in, recent, years, the, extensible, markup, language, xml, has, become, a, popular, format, for, data, representation, although, xml, data, can, be, stored, in, normal, file, systems, it, is, commonly, held, in, relational, databases, to, take, advantage, of, their, robust, implementation, verified, by, years, of, both, theoretical, and, practical, effort, as, an, evolution, of, the, standard, generalized, markup, language, sgml, xml, s, text, based, structure, offers, the, advantage, of, being, both, machine, and, human, readable, data, transmission, has, three, aspects, transmission, propagation, and, reception, it, can, be, broadly, categorized, as, broadcasting, in, which, information, is, transmitted, unidirectionally, downstream, or, telecommunications, with, bidirectional, upstream, and, downstream, channels, xml, has, been, increasingly, employed, as, a, means, of, data, interchange, since, the, early, 2000s, particularly, for, machine, oriented, interactions, such, as, those, involved, in, web, oriented, protocols, such, as, soap, describing, data, in, transit, rather, than, data, at, rest, hilbert, and, lopez, identify, the, exponential, pace, of, technological, change, a, kind, of, moore, s, law, machines, application, specific, capacity, to, compute, information, per, capita, roughly, doubled, every, 14, months, between, 1986, and, 2007, the, per, capita, capacity, of, the, world, s, general, purpose, computers, doubled, every, 18, months, during, the, same, two, decades, the, global, telecommunication, capacity, per, capita, doubled, every, 34, months, the, world, s, storage, capacity, per, capita, required, roughly, 40, months, to, double, every, 3, years, and, per, capita, broadcast, information, has, doubled, every, 12, 3, years, massive, amounts, of, data, are, stored, worldwide, every, day, but, unless, it, can, be, analyzed, and, presented, effectively, it, essentially, resides, in, what, have, been, called, data, tombs, data, archives, that, are, seldom, visited, to, address, that, issue, the, field, of, data, mining, the, process, of, discovering, interesting, patterns, and, knowledge, from, large, amounts, of, data, emerged, in, the, late, 1980s, the, technology, and, services, it, provides, for, sending, and, receiving, electronic, messages, called, letters, or, electronic, letters, over, a, distributed, including, global, computer, network, in, terms, of, the, composition, of, elements, and, the, principle, of, operation, electronic, mail, practically, repeats, the, system, of, regular, paper, mail, borrowing, both, terms, mail, letter, envelope, attachment, box, delivery, and, others, and, characteristic, features, ease, of, use, message, transmission, delays, sufficient, reliability, and, at, the, same, time, no, guarantee, of, delivery, the, advantages, of, e, mail, are, easily, perceived, and, remembered, by, a, person, addresses, of, the, form, user, name, domain, name, for, example, somebody, example, com, the, ability, to, transfer, both, plain, text, and, formatted, as, well, as, arbitrary, files, independence, of, servers, in, the, general, case, they, address, each, other, directly, sufficiently, high, reliability, of, message, delivery, ease, of, use, by, humans, and, programs, disadvantages, of, e, mail, the, presence, of, such, a, phenomenon, as, spam, massive, advertising, and, viral, mailings, the, theoretical, impossibility, of, guaranteed, delivery, of, a, particular, letter, possible, delays, in, message, delivery, up, to, several, days, limits, on, the, size, of, one, message, and, on, the, total, size, of, messages, in, the, mailbox, personal, for, users, a, software, and, hardware, complex, with, a, web, interface, that, provides, the, ability, to, search, for, information, on, the, internet, a, search, engine, usually, means, a, site, that, hosts, the, interface, front, end, of, the, system, the, software, part, of, a, search, engine, is, a, search, engine, search, engine, a, set, of, programs, that, provides, the, functionality, of, a, search, engine, and, is, usually, a, trade, secret, of, the, search, engine, developer, company, most, search, engines, look, for, information, on, world, wide, web, sites, but, there, are, also, systems, that, can, look, for, files, on, ftp, servers, items, in, online, stores, and, information, on, usenet, newsgroups, improving, search, is, one, of, the, priorities, of, the, modern, internet, see, the, deep, web, article, about, the, main, problems, in, the, work, of, search, engines, companies, in, the, information, technology, field, are, often, discussed, as, a, group, as, the, tech, sector, or, the, tech, industry, these, titles, can, be, misleading, at, times, and, should, not, be, mistaken, for, tech, companies, which, are, generally, large, scale, for, profit, corporations, that, sell, consumer, technology, and, software, it, is, also, worth, noting, that, from, a, business, perspective, information, technology, departments, are, a, cost, center, the, majority, of, the, time, a, cost, center, is, a, department, or, staff, which, incurs, expenses, or, costs, within, a, company, rather, than, generating, profits, or, revenue, streams, modern, businesses, rely, heavily, on, technology, for, their, day, to, day, operations, so, the, expenses, delegated, to, cover, technology, that, facilitates, business, in, a, more, efficient, manner, are, usually, seen, as, just, the, cost, of, doing, business, it, departments, are, allocated, funds, by, senior, leadership, and, must, attempt, to, achieve, the, desired, deliverables, while, staying, within, that, budget, government, and, the, private, sector, might, have, different, funding, mechanisms, but, the, principles, are, more, or, less, the, same, this, is, an, often, overlooked, reason, for, the, rapid, interest, in, automation, and, artificial, intelligence, but, the, constant, pressure, to, do, more, with, less, is, opening, the, door, for, automation, to, take, control, of, at, least, some, minor, operations, in, large, companies, many, companies, now, have, it, departments, for, managing, the, computers, networks, and, other, technical, areas, of, their, businesses, companies, have, also, sought, to, integrate, it, with, business, outcomes, and, decision, making, through, a, bizops, or, business, operations, department, in, a, business, context, the, information, technology, association, of, america, has, defined, information, technology, as, the, study, design, development, application, implementation, support, or, management, of, computer, based, information, systems, the, responsibilities, of, those, working, in, the, field, include, network, administration, software, development, and, installation, and, the, planning, and, management, of, an, organization, s, technology, life, cycle, by, which, hardware, and, software, are, maintained, upgraded, and, replaced, information, services, is, a, term, somewhat, loosely, applied, to, a, variety, of, it, related, services, offered, by, commercial, companies, as, well, as, data, brokers, the, field, of, information, ethics, was, established, by, mathematician, norbert, wiener, in, the, 1940s, 9, some, of, the, ethical, issues, associated, with, the, use, of, information, technology, include, 20, 21, research, suggests, that, it, projects, in, business, and, public, administration, can, easily, become, significant, in, scale, work, conducted, by, mckinsey, in, collaboration, with, the, university, of, oxford, suggested, that, half, of, all, large, scale, it, projects, those, with, initial, cost, estimates, of, 15, million, or, more, often, failed, to, maintain, costs, within, their, initial, budgets, or, to, complete, on, time
