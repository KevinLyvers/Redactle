a, photocopier, also, called, copier, or, copy, machine, and, formerly, xerox, machine, the, generic, trademark, is, a, machine, that, makes, copies, of, documents, and, other, visual, images, onto, paper, or, plastic, film, quickly, and, cheaply, most, modern, photocopiers, use, a, technology, called, xerography, a, dry, process, that, uses, electrostatic, charges, on, a, light, sensitive, photoreceptor, to, first, attract, and, then, transfer, toner, particles, a, powder, onto, paper, in, the, form, of, an, image, the, toner, is, then, fused, onto, the, paper, using, heat, pressure, or, a, combination, of, both, copiers, can, also, use, other, technologies, such, as, inkjet, but, xerography, is, standard, for, office, copying, commercial, xerographic, office, photocopying, gradually, replaced, copies, made, by, verifax, photostat, carbon, paper, mimeograph, machines, and, other, duplicating, machines, photocopying, is, widely, used, in, the, business, education, and, government, sectors, while, there, have, been, predictions, that, photocopiers, will, eventually, become, obsolete, as, information, workers, increase, their, use, of, digital, document, creation, storage, and, distribution, and, rely, less, on, distributing, actual, pieces, of, paper, as, of, 2015, photocopiers, continue, to, be, widely, used, during, the, 1980s, a, convergence, began, in, some, high, end, machines, towards, what, came, to, be, called, a, multi, function, printer, a, device, that, combined, the, roles, of, a, photocopier, a, fax, machine, a, scanner, and, a, computer, network, connected, printer, low, end, machines, that, can, copy, and, print, in, color, have, increasingly, dominated, the, home, office, market, as, their, prices, fell, steadily, during, the, 1990s, high, end, color, photocopiers, capable, of, heavy, duty, handling, cycles, and, large, format, printing, remain, a, costly, option, found, primarily, in, print, and, design, shops, chester, carlson, 1906, 1968, the, inventor, of, photocopying, was, originally, a, patent, attorney, as, well, as, a, part, time, researcher, and, inventor, his, job, at, the, patent, office, in, new, york, required, him, to, make, a, large, number, of, copies, of, important, papers, carlson, who, was, arthritic, found, this, a, painful, and, tedious, process, this, motivated, him, to, conduct, experiments, with, photoconductivity, carlson, used, his, kitchen, for, his, electrophotography, experiments, and, in, 1938, he, applied, for, a, patent, for, the, process, he, made, the, first, photocopy, using, a, zinc, plate, covered, with, sulfur, the, words, 10, 22, 38, astoria, were, written, on, a, microscope, slide, which, was, placed, on, top, of, more, sulfur, and, under, a, bright, light, after, the, slide, was, removed, a, mirror, image, of, the, words, remained, carlson, tried, to, sell, his, invention, to, some, companies, but, failed, because, the, process, was, still, underdeveloped, at, the, time, multiple, copies, were, most, commonly, made, at, the, point, of, document, origination, using, carbon, paper, or, manual, duplicating, machines, people, did, not, see, the, need, for, an, electronic, copier, between, 1939, and, 1944, carlson, was, turned, down, by, over, 20, companies, including, ibm, and, general, electric, neither, of, which, believed, there, was, a, significant, market, for, copiers, in, 1944, the, battelle, memorial, institute, a, non, profit, organization, in, columbus, ohio, contracted, with, carlson, to, refine, his, new, process, over, the, next, five, years, the, institute, conducted, experiments, to, improve, the, process, of, electrophotography, in, 1947, haloid, corporation, a, manufacturer, of, photographic, paper, approached, battelle, to, obtain, a, license, to, develop, and, market, a, copying, machine, based, on, this, technology, haloid, felt, that, the, word, electrophotography, was, too, complicated, and, did, not, have, good, recall, value, after, consulting, a, professor, of, classical, language, at, ohio, state, university, haloid, and, carlson, changed, the, name, of, the, process, to, xerography, a, term, coined, from, greek, roots, that, meant, dry, writing, haloid, called, the, new, copier, machines, xerox, machines, and, in, 1948, the, term, xerox, was, trademarked, haloid, eventually, became, xerox, corporation, in, 1961, in, 1949, xerox, corporation, introduced, the, first, xerographic, copier, called, the, model, a, seeing, off, computing, leader, ibm, in, the, office, copying, market, xerox, became, so, successful, that, in, north, america, photocopying, came, to, be, popularly, known, as, xeroxing, xerox, has, actively, fought, to, prevent, xerox, from, becoming, a, genericized, trademark, while, the, word, xerox, has, appeared, in, some, dictionaries, as, a, synonym, for, photocopying, xerox, corporation, typically, requests, such, entries, be, modified, and, discourages, use, of, the, term, xerox, in, this, way, in, the, early, 1950s, radio, corporation, of, america, rca, introduced, a, variation, on, the, process, called, electrofax, whereby, images, are, formed, directly, on, specially, coated, paper, and, rendered, with, a, toner, dispersed, in, a, liquid, during, the, 1960s, and, through, the, 1980s, savin, corporation, developed, and, sold, a, line, of, liquid, toner, copiers, that, implemented, a, technology, based, on, patents, held, by, the, company, before, the, widespread, adoption, of, xerographic, copiers, photo, direct, copies, produced, by, machines, such, as, kodak, s, verifax, based, on, a, 1947, patent, were, used, a, primary, obstacle, associated, with, the, pre, xerographic, copying, technologies, was, the, high, cost, of, supplies, a, verifax, print, required, supplies, costing, us, 0, 15, in, 1969, while, a, xerox, print, could, be, made, for, 0, 03, including, paper, and, labor, the, coin, operated, photostat, machines, still, found, in, some, public, libraries, in, the, late, 1960s, made, letter, size, copies, for, 0, 25, each, when, the, minimum, wage, for, a, us, worker, was, 1, 65, per, hour, the, xerox, machines, that, replaced, them, typically, charged, 0, 10, xerographic, copier, manufacturers, took, advantage, of, the, high, perceived, value, copying, had, in, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, and, marketed, specially, designed, paper, for, xerographic, output, by, the, end, of, the, 1970s, paper, producers, made, xerographic, runability, one, of, the, requirements, for, most, of, their, office, paper, brands, some, devices, sold, as, photocopiers, have, replaced, the, drum, based, process, with, inkjet, or, transfer, film, technology, among, the, key, advantages, of, photocopiers, over, earlier, copying, technologies, is, their, ability, in, 1970, paul, orfalea, founded, kinko, s, retail, chain, in, isla, vista, california, starting, with, a, single, copier, that, year, this, copy, service, chain, would, expand, to, over, 1, 000, locations, around, the, world, by, the, 1980s, kinko, s, operated, 24, hours, a, day, 7, days, a, week, with, customers, using, the, copy, center, for, academic, and, business, work, as, well, as, personal, publishing, and, advertising, by, the, 1990s, kinko, s, had, 700, locations, around, the, united, states, with, 5, in, manhattan, in, such, urban, areas, kinko, s, became, a, place, where, a, multitude, of, users, could, make, their, ideas, typed, designed, and, xeroxed, then, transmitted, by, fax, computer, disk, and, federal, express, kate, eichhorn, in, adjusted, margin, xerography, art, and, activism, in, the, late, twentieth, century, notes, that, during, this, period, 1970s, through, 1990s, the, copy, machine, played, an, especially, notable, role, in, the, era, s, punk, street, art, and, diy, movements, fedex, purchased, the, kinko, s, chain, in, 2004, and, its, services, were, incorporated, into, the, name, fedex, office, in, 2008, colored, toner, became, available, in, the, 1940s, although, full, color, copiers, were, not, commercially, available, until, 1968, when, 3m, released, the, color, in, color, copier, which, used, a, dye, sublimation, process, rather, than, conventional, electrostatic, technology, xerox, introduced, the, first, electrostatic, color, copier, the, 6500, in, 1973, color, photocopying, is, a, concern, to, governments, as, it, facilitates, counterfeiting, currency, and, other, documents, for, more, information, see, counterfeiting, section, there, is, an, increasing, trend, for, new, photocopiers, to, implement, digital, technology, thereby, replacing, the, older, analog, technology, with, digital, copying, the, copier, effectively, consists, of, an, integrated, scanner, and, laser, printer, this, design, has, several, advantages, such, as, automatic, image, quality, enhancement, and, the, ability, to, build, jobs, that, is, to, scan, page, images, independently, of, printing, them, some, digital, copiers, can, function, as, high, speed, scanners, such, models, typically, offer, the, ability, to, send, documents, via, email, or, make, them, available, on, file, servers, a, significant, advantage, of, digital, copier, technology, is, automatic, digital, collation, for, example, when, copying, a, set, of, 20, pages, 20, times, a, digital, copier, scans, each, page, only, once, then, uses, the, stored, information, to, produce, 20, sets, in, an, analog, copier, either, each, page, is, scanned, 20, times, a, total, of, 400, scans, making, one, set, at, a, time, or, 20, separate, output, trays, are, used, for, the, 20, sets, low, end, copiers, also, use, digital, technology, but, tend, to, consist, of, a, standard, pc, scanner, coupled, to, an, inkjet, or, low, end, laser, printer, which, are, far, slower, than, their, counterparts, in, high, end, copiers, however, low, end, scanner, inkjets, can, provide, color, copying, at, a, lower, upfront, purchase, price, but, a, much, higher, cost, per, copy, combined, digital, scanner, printers, sometimes, have, built, in, fax, machines, and, can, be, classified, as, one, type, of, multifunction, printer, a, negative, photocopy, inverts, the, document, s, colors, when, creating, a, photocopy, resulting, in, letters, that, appear, white, on, a, black, background, instead, of, black, on, a, white, background, negative, photocopies, of, old, or, faded, documents, sometimes, produce, documents, that, have, better, focus, and, are, easier, to, read, and, study, photocopying, material, that, is, subject, to, copyright, such, as, books, or, scientific, papers, is, subject, to, restrictions, in, most, countries, this, is, common, practice, as, the, cost, of, purchasing, a, book, for, the, sake, of, one, article, or, a, few, pages, can, be, excessive, the, principle, of, fair, use, in, the, united, states, or, fair, dealing, in, other, berne, convention, countries, allows, copying, for, certain, specified, purposes, in, certain, countries, such, as, canada, some, universities, pay, royalties, from, each, photocopy, made, at, university, copy, machines, and, copy, centers, to, copyright, collectives, out, of, the, revenues, from, the, photocopying, and, these, collectives, distribute, resulting, funds, to, various, scholarly, publishers, in, the, united, states, photocopied, compilations, of, articles, handouts, graphics, and, other, information, called, readers, often, require, texts, for, college, classes, either, the, instructor, or, the, copy, center, is, responsible, for, clearing, copyright, for, every, article, in, the, reader, and, attribution, information, must, be, clearly, included, in, the, reader, to, counter, the, risk, of, people, using, color, copiers, to, create, counterfeit, copies, of, paper, currency, some, countries, have, incorporated, anti, counterfeiting, technologies, into, their, currency, these, include, watermarks, microprinting, holograms, tiny, security, strips, made, of, plastic, or, other, material, and, ink, that, appears, to, change, color, as, the, currency, is, viewed, at, an, angle, some, photocopying, machines, contain, special, software, that, can, prevent, copying, currency, that, has, a, special, pattern, color, copying, also, raises, concerns, regarding, the, copying, and, or, forging, of, other, documents, such, as, driver, s, licenses, and, university, degrees, and, transcripts, some, driver, s, licenses, are, made, with, embedded, holograms, so, that, a, police, officer, can, detect, a, fake, copy, some, university, and, college, transcripts, have, special, anti, copying, watermarks, in, the, background, if, a, copy, is, made, the, watermarks, will, become, highly, visible, which, allows, the, recipient, to, determine, that, they, have, a, copy, rather, than, a, genuine, original, transcript, exposure, to, ultraviolet, light, is, a, concern, in, the, early, days, of, photocopiers, the, sensitizing, light, source, was, filtered, green, to, match, the, optimal, sensitivity, of, the, photoconductive, surface, this, filtering, conveniently, removed, all, ultraviolet, currently, a, variety, of, light, sources, are, used, as, glass, transmits, ultraviolet, rays, between, 325, and, 400, nanometers, copiers, with, ultraviolet, producing, lights, such, as, fluorescent, tungsten, halogen, or, xenon, flash, expose, documents, to, some, ultraviolet, concerns, about, emissions, from, photocopy, machines, have, been, expressed, by, some, in, connection, with, the, use, of, selenium, and, emissions, of, ozone, and, fumes, from, heated, toner, similar, to, forensic, identification, of, typewriters, computer, printers, and, copiers, can, be, traced, by, imperfections, in, their, output, the, mechanical, tolerances, of, the, toner, and, paper, feed, mechanisms, cause, banding, which, can, reveal, information, about, the, individual, device, s, mechanical, properties, it, is, often, possible, to, identify, the, manufacturer, and, brand, and, in, some, cases, the, individual, printer, can, be, identified, from, a, set, of, known, printers, by, comparing, their, outputs, some, high, quality, color, printers, and, copiers, steganographically, embed, their, identification, code, into, the, printed, pages, as, fine, and, almost, invisible, patterns, of, yellow, dots, some, sources, identify, xerox, and, canon, as, companies, doing, this, the, electronic, frontier, foundation, eff, has, investigated, this, issue, and, documented, how, the, xerox, docucolor, printer, s, serial, number, as, well, as, the, date, and, time, of, the, printout, are, encoded, in, a, repeating, 8, 15, dot, pattern, in, the, yellow, channel, eff, is, working, to, reverse, engineer, additional, printers, the, eff, also, reports, that, the, us, government, has, asked, these, companies, to, implement, such, a, tracking, scheme, so, that, counterfeiting, can, be, traced, the, eff, has, filed, a, freedom, of, information, act, request, in, order, to, look, into, privacy, implications, of, this, tracking, photocopying, using, liquid, developer, was, developed, by, ken, metcalfe, and, bob, wright, of, defence, standards, laboratory, in, adelaide, in, 1952, photocopying, using, liquid, developer, was, used, in, 1967, images, from, wet, photocopying, do, not, last, as, long, as, dry, toner, images, but, this, is, not, due, to, acidity
