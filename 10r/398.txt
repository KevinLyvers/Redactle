a, saw, is, a, tool, consisting, of, a, tough, blade, wire, or, chain, with, a, hard, toothed, edge, used, to, cut, through, material, various, terms, are, used, to, describe, toothed, and, abrasive, saws, saws, began, as, serrated, materials, and, when, mankind, learned, how, to, use, iron, it, became, the, preferred, material, for, saw, blades, of, all, kind, there, are, numerous, types, of, hands, saws, and, mechanical, saws, and, different, types, of, blades, and, cuts, a, saw, is, a, tool, consisting, of, a, tough, blade, wire, or, chain, with, a, hard, toothed, edge, it, is, used, to, cut, through, material, very, often, wood, though, sometimes, metal, or, stone, a, number, of, terms, are, used, to, describe, saws, the, narrow, channel, left, behind, by, the, saw, and, relatedly, the, measure, of, its, width, is, known, as, the, kerf, as, such, it, also, refers, to, the, wasted, material, that, is, turned, into, sawdust, and, becomes, a, factor, in, measurements, when, making, cuts, for, example, cutting, an, 8, foot, 2, 4, meter, piece, of, wood, into, 1, foot, 30, cm, sections, with, 1, 8, inch, 3, mm, kerf, will, produce, only, seven, sections, plus, one, that, is, 7, 8, inch, 21, mm, too, short, when, factoring, in, the, kerf, from, all, the, cuts, the, kerf, depends, on, several, factors, the, width, of, the, saw, blade, the, set, of, the, blade, s, teeth, the, amount, of, wobble, created, during, cutting, and, the, amount, of, material, pulled, out, of, the, sides, of, the, cut, although, the, term, kerf, is, often, used, informally, to, refer, simply, to, the, thickness, of, the, saw, blade, or, to, the, width, of, the, set, this, can, be, misleading, because, blades, with, the, same, thickness, and, set, may, create, different, kerfs, for, example, a, too, thin, blade, can, cause, excessive, wobble, creating, a, wider, than, expected, kerf, the, kerf, created, by, a, given, blade, can, be, changed, by, adjusting, the, set, of, its, teeth, with, a, tool, called, a, saw, tooth, setter, the, kerf, left, behind, by, a, laser, beam, can, be, changed, based, on, the, laser, s, power, and, type, of, material, being, cut, a, toothed, saw, or, tooth, saw, has, a, hard, toothed, edge, the, cut, is, made, by, placing, the, toothed, edge, against, the, material, and, moving, it, back, and, forth, or, continuously, forward, this, force, may, be, applied, by, hand, or, powered, by, steam, water, electricity, or, other, power, source, the, most, common, measurement, of, the, frequency, of, teeth, on, a, saw, blade, is, point, per, inch, 25, mm, it, is, taken, by, setting, the, tip, or, point, of, one, tooth, at, the, zero, point, on, a, ruler, and, then, counting, the, number, of, points, between, the, zero, mark, and, the, one, inch, mark, inclusive, that, is, including, both, the, point, at, the, zero, mark, and, any, point, that, lines, up, precisely, with, the, one, inch, mark, there, is, always, one, more, point, per, inch, than, there, are, teeth, per, inch, e, g, a, saw, with, 14, points, per, inch, will, have, 13, teeth, per, inch, and, a, saw, with, 10, points, per, inch, will, have, 9, teeth, per, inch, some, saws, do, not, have, the, same, number, of, teeth, per, inch, throughout, their, entire, length, but, the, vast, majority, do, those, with, more, teeth, per, inch, at, the, toe, are, described, as, having, incremental, teeth, in, order, to, make, starting, the, saw, cut, easier, an, alternative, measurement, of, the, frequency, of, teeth, on, a, saw, blade, is, teeth, per, inch, usually, abbreviated, tpi, as, in, a, blade, consisting, of, 18tpi, cf, points, per, inch, set, is, the, degree, to, which, the, teeth, are, bent, out, sideways, away, from, the, blade, usually, in, both, directions, in, most, modern, serrated, saws, the, teeth, are, set, so, that, the, kerf, the, width, of, the, cut, will, be, wider, than, the, blade, itself, this, allows, the, blade, to, move, through, the, cut, easily, without, binding, getting, stuck, the, set, may, be, different, depending, on, the, kind, of, cut, the, saw, is, intended, to, make, for, example, a, ripsaw, has, a, tooth, set, that, is, similar, to, the, angle, used, on, a, chisel, so, that, it, rips, or, tears, the, material, apart, a, flush, cutting, saw, has, no, set, on, one, side, so, that, the, saw, can, be, laid, flat, on, a, surface, and, cut, along, that, surface, without, scratching, it, the, set, of, the, blade, s, teeth, can, be, adjusted, with, a, tool, called, a, saw, set, an, abrasive, saw, has, a, powered, circular, blade, designed, to, cut, through, metal, or, ceramic, saws, were, at, first, serrated, materials, such, as, flint, obsidian, sea, shells, and, shark, teeth, serrated, tools, with, indications, that, they, were, used, to, cut, wood, were, found, at, pech, de, l, az, cave, iv, in, france, these, tools, date, to, 90, 000, 30, 000, years, bce, in, ancient, egypt, open, unframed, pull, saws, made, of, copper, are, documented, as, early, as, the, early, dynastic, period, c, 3, 100, 2, 686, bc, many, copper, saws, were, found, in, tomb, no, 3471, dating, to, the, reign, of, djer, in, the, 31st, century, bc, saws, were, used, for, cutting, a, variety, of, materials, including, humans, death, by, sawing, and, models, of, saws, were, used, in, many, contexts, throughout, egyptian, history, particularly, useful, are, tomb, wall, illustrations, of, carpenters, at, work, that, show, the, sizes, and, use, of, different, types, of, saws, egyptian, saws, were, at, first, serrated, hardened, copper, which, may, have, cut, on, both, pull, and, push, strokes, as, the, saw, developed, teeth, were, raked, to, cut, only, on, the, pull, stroke, and, set, with, the, teeth, projecting, only, on, one, side, rather, than, in, the, modern, fashion, with, an, alternating, set, saws, were, also, made, of, bronze, and, later, iron, in, the, iron, age, frame, saws, were, developed, holding, the, thin, blades, in, tension, the, earliest, known, sawmill, is, the, roman, hierapolis, sawmill, from, the, third, century, ad, and, was, for, sawing, stone, according, to, chinese, legend, the, saw, was, invented, by, lu, ban, in, greek, mythology, as, recounted, by, ovid, talos, the, nephew, of, daedalus, invented, the, saw, in, archeological, reality, saws, date, back, to, prehistory, and, most, probably, evolved, from, neolithic, stone, or, bone, tools, he, identities, of, the, axe, adz, chisel, and, saw, were, clearly, established, more, than, 4, 000, years, ago, once, mankind, had, learned, how, to, use, iron, it, became, the, preferred, material, for, saw, blades, of, all, kinds, some, cultures, learned, how, to, harden, the, surface, case, hardening, or, steeling, prolonging, the, blade, s, life, and, sharpness, steel, made, of, iron, with, moderate, carbon, content, and, hardened, by, quenching, hot, steel, in, water, was, used, as, early, as, 1200, bc, by, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, european, manufacture, centred, on, germany, the, bergisches, land, in, london, and, the, midlands, of, england, most, blades, were, made, of, steel, iron, carbonised, and, re, forged, by, different, methods, in, the, mid, 18th, century, a, superior, form, of, completely, melted, steel, crucible, cast, began, to, be, made, in, sheffield, england, and, this, rapidly, became, the, preferred, material, due, to, its, hardness, ductility, springiness, and, ability, to, take, a, fine, polish, a, small, saw, industry, survived, in, london, and, birmingham, but, by, the, 1820s, the, industry, was, growing, rapidly, and, increasingly, concentrated, in, sheffield, which, remained, the, largest, centre, of, production, with, over, 50, of, the, nation, s, saw, makers, the, us, industry, began, to, overtake, it, in, the, last, decades, of, the, century, due, to, superior, mechanisation, better, marketing, a, large, domestic, market, and, the, imposition, of, high, tariffs, on, imports, highly, productive, industries, continued, in, germany, and, france, early, european, saws, were, made, from, a, heated, sheet, of, iron, or, steel, produced, by, flattening, by, several, men, simultaneously, hammering, on, an, anvil, after, cooling, the, teeth, were, punched, out, one, at, a, time, with, a, die, the, size, varying, with, the, size, of, the, saw, the, teeth, were, sharpened, with, a, triangular, file, of, appropriate, size, and, set, with, a, hammer, or, a, wrest, by, the, mid, 18th, century, rolling, the, metal, was, usual, the, power, for, the, rolls, being, supplied, first, by, water, and, increasingly, by, the, early, 19th, century, by, steam, engines, the, industry, gradually, mechanized, all, the, processes, including, the, important, grinding, the, saw, plate, thin, to, the, back, by, a, fraction, of, an, inch, which, helped, the, saw, to, pass, through, the, kerf, without, binding, the, use, of, steel, added, the, need, to, harden, and, temper, the, saw, plate, to, grind, it, flat, to, smith, it, by, hand, hammering, and, ensure, the, springiness, and, resistance, to, bending, deformity, and, finally, to, polish, it, most, hand, saws, are, today, entirely, made, without, human, intervention, with, the, steel, plate, supplied, ready, rolled, to, thickness, and, tensioned, before, being, cut, to, shape, by, laser, the, teeth, are, shaped, and, sharpened, by, grinding, and, are, flame, hardened, to, obviate, and, actually, prevent, sharpening, once, they, have, become, blunt, a, large, measure, of, hand, finishing, remains, to, this, day, for, quality, saws, by, the, very, few, specialist, makers, reproducing, the, 19th, century, designs, a, pit, saw, was, a, two, man, ripsaw, in, parts, of, early, colonial, north, america, it, was, one, of, the, principal, tools, used, in, shipyards, and, other, industries, where, water, powered, sawmills, were, not, available, it, was, so, named, because, it, was, typically, operated, over, a, saw, pit, either, at, ground, level, or, on, trestles, across, which, logs, that, were, to, be, cut, into, boards, the, pit, saw, was, a, strong, steel, cutting, plate, of, great, breadth, with, large, teeth, highly, polished, and, thoroughly, wrought, some, eight, or, ten, feet, in, length, with, either, a, handle, on, each, end, or, a, frame, saw, a, pit, saw, was, also, sometimes, known, as, a, whipsaw, it, took, 2, 4, people, to, operate, a, pit, man, stood, in, the, pit, a, top, man, stood, outside, the, pit, and, they, worked, together, to, make, cuts, guide, the, saw, and, raise, it, pit, saw, workers, were, among, the, most, highly, paid, laborers, in, early, colonial, north, america, hand, saws, typically, have, a, relatively, thick, blade, to, make, them, stiff, enough, to, cut, through, material, the, pull, stroke, also, reduces, the, amount, of, stiffness, required, thin, bladed, handsaws, are, made, stiff, enough, either, by, holding, them, in, tension, in, a, frame, or, by, backing, them, with, a, folded, strip, of, steel, formerly, iron, or, brass, on, account, of, which, the, latter, are, called, back, saws, some, examples, of, hand, saws, are, back, saws, which, have, a, thin, blade, backed, with, steel, or, brass, to, maintain, rigidity, are, a, subset, of, hand, saws, back, saws, have, different, names, depending, on, the, length, of, the, blade, tenon, saw, from, use, in, making, mortise, and, tenon, joints, is, often, used, as, a, generic, name, for, all, the, sizes, of, woodworking, backsaw, some, examples, are, a, class, of, saws, for, cutting, all, types, of, material, they, may, be, small, or, large, and, the, frame, may, be, wood, or, metal, most, blade, teeth, are, made, either, of, tool, steel, or, carbide, carbide, is, harder, and, holds, a, sharp, edge, much, longer, there, are, several, materials, used, in, saws, with, each, of, its, own, specifications, salaman, r, a, dictionary, of, woodworking, tools, revised, edition, 1989
