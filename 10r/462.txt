telegraphy, is, the, long, distance, transmission, of, messages, where, the, sender, uses, symbolic, codes, known, to, the, recipient, rather, than, a, physical, exchange, of, an, object, bearing, the, message, thus, flag, semaphore, is, a, method, of, telegraphy, whereas, pigeon, post, is, not, ancient, signalling, systems, although, sometimes, quite, extensive, and, sophisticated, as, in, china, were, generally, not, capable, of, transmitting, arbitrary, text, messages, possible, messages, were, fixed, and, predetermined, so, such, systems, are, thus, not, true, telegraphs, the, earliest, true, telegraph, put, into, widespread, use, was, the, chappe, telegraph, an, optical, telegraph, invented, by, claude, chappe, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, system, was, used, extensively, in, france, and, european, nations, occupied, by, france, during, the, napoleonic, era, the, electric, telegraph, started, to, replace, the, optical, telegraph, in, the, mid, 19th, century, it, was, first, taken, up, in, britain, in, the, form, of, the, cooke, and, wheatstone, telegraph, initially, used, mostly, as, an, aid, to, railway, signalling, this, was, quickly, followed, by, a, different, system, developed, in, the, united, states, by, samuel, morse, the, electric, telegraph, was, slower, to, develop, in, france, due, to, the, established, optical, telegraph, system, but, an, electrical, telegraph, was, put, into, use, with, a, code, compatible, with, the, chappe, optical, telegraph, the, morse, system, was, adopted, as, the, international, standard, in, 1865, using, a, modified, morse, code, developed, in, germany, in, 1848, the, heliograph, is, a, telegraph, system, using, reflected, sunlight, for, signalling, it, was, mainly, used, in, areas, where, the, electrical, telegraph, had, not, been, established, and, generally, used, the, same, code, the, most, extensive, heliograph, network, established, was, in, arizona, and, new, mexico, during, the, apache, wars, the, heliograph, was, standard, military, equipment, as, late, as, world, war, ii, wireless, telegraphy, developed, in, the, early, 20th, century, became, important, for, maritime, use, and, was, a, competitor, to, electrical, telegraphy, using, submarine, telegraph, cables, in, international, communications, telegrams, became, a, popular, means, of, sending, messages, once, telegraph, prices, had, fallen, sufficiently, traffic, became, high, enough, to, spur, the, development, of, automated, systems, teleprinters, and, punched, tape, transmission, these, systems, led, to, new, telegraph, codes, starting, with, the, baudot, code, however, telegrams, were, never, able, to, compete, with, the, letter, post, on, price, and, competition, from, the, telephone, which, removed, their, speed, advantage, drove, the, telegraph, into, decline, from, 1920, onwards, the, few, remaining, telegraph, applications, were, largely, taken, over, by, alternatives, on, the, internet, towards, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, the, word, telegraph, from, ancient, greek, t, le, at, a, distance, and, gr, phein, to, write, was, coined, by, the, french, inventor, of, the, semaphore, telegraph, claude, chappe, who, also, coined, the, word, semaphore, a, telegraph, is, a, device, for, transmitting, and, receiving, messages, over, long, distances, i, e, for, telegraphy, the, word, telegraph, alone, generally, refers, to, an, electrical, telegraph, wireless, telegraphy, is, transmission, of, messages, over, radio, with, telegraphic, codes, contrary, to, the, extensive, definition, used, by, chappe, morse, argued, that, the, term, telegraph, can, strictly, be, applied, only, to, systems, that, transmit, and, record, messages, at, a, distance, this, is, to, be, distinguished, from, semaphore, which, merely, transmits, messages, smoke, signals, for, instance, are, to, be, considered, semaphore, not, telegraph, according, to, morse, telegraph, dates, only, from, 1832, when, pavel, schilling, invented, one, of, the, earliest, electrical, telegraphs, a, telegraph, message, sent, by, an, electrical, telegraph, operator, or, telegrapher, using, morse, code, or, a, printing, telegraph, operator, using, plain, text, was, known, as, a, telegram, a, cablegram, was, a, message, sent, by, a, submarine, telegraph, cable, often, shortened, to, cable, or, wire, the, suffix, gram, is, derived, from, ancient, greek, gramma, meaning, something, written, i, e, telegram, means, something, written, at, a, distance, and, cablegram, means, something, written, via, a, cable, whereas, telegraph, implies, the, process, of, writing, at, a, distance, later, a, telex, was, a, message, sent, by, a, telex, network, a, switched, network, of, teleprinters, similar, to, a, telephone, network, a, wirephoto, or, wire, picture, was, a, newspaper, picture, that, was, sent, from, a, remote, location, by, a, facsimile, telegraph, a, diplomatic, telegram, also, known, as, a, diplomatic, cable, is, a, confidential, communication, between, a, diplomatic, mission, and, the, foreign, ministry, of, its, parent, country, these, continue, to, be, called, telegrams, or, cables, regardless, of, the, method, used, for, transmission, passing, messages, by, signalling, over, distance, is, an, ancient, practice, one, of, the, oldest, examples, is, the, signal, towers, of, the, great, wall, of, china, in, 400, bc, signals, could, be, sent, by, beacon, fires, or, drum, beats, by, 200, bc, complex, flag, signalling, had, developed, and, by, the, han, dynasty, 200, bc, 220, ad, signallers, had, a, choice, of, lights, flags, or, gunshots, to, send, signals, by, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, a, message, could, be, sent, 1, 100, kilometres, 700, mi, in, 24, hours, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, added, artillery, to, the, possible, signals, while, the, signalling, was, complex, for, instance, different, coloured, flags, could, be, used, to, indicate, enemy, strength, only, predetermined, messages, could, be, sent, the, chinese, signalling, system, extended, well, beyond, the, great, wall, signal, towers, away, from, the, wall, were, used, to, give, early, warning, of, an, attack, others, were, built, even, further, out, as, part, of, the, protection, of, trade, routes, especially, the, silk, road, signal, fires, were, widely, used, in, europe, and, elsewhere, for, military, purposes, the, roman, army, made, frequent, use, of, them, as, did, their, enemies, and, the, remains, of, some, of, the, stations, still, exist, few, details, have, been, recorded, of, european, mediterranean, signalling, systems, and, the, possible, messages, one, of, the, few, for, which, details, are, known, is, a, system, invented, by, aeneas, tacticus, 4th, century, bc, tacticus, s, system, had, water, filled, pots, at, the, two, signal, stations, which, were, drained, in, synchronisation, annotation, on, a, floating, scale, indicated, which, message, was, being, sent, or, received, signals, sent, by, means, of, torches, indicated, when, to, start, and, stop, draining, to, keep, the, synchronisation, none, of, the, signalling, systems, discussed, above, are, true, telegraphs, in, the, sense, of, a, system, that, can, transmit, arbitrary, messages, over, arbitrary, distances, lines, of, signalling, relay, stations, can, send, messages, to, any, required, distance, but, all, these, systems, are, limited, to, one, extent, or, another, in, the, range, of, messages, that, they, can, send, a, system, like, flag, semaphore, with, an, alphabetic, code, can, certainly, send, any, given, message, but, the, system, is, designed, for, short, range, communication, between, two, persons, an, engine, order, telegraph, used, to, send, instructions, from, the, bridge, of, a, ship, to, the, engine, room, fails, to, meet, both, criteria, it, has, a, limited, distance, and, very, simple, message, set, there, was, only, one, ancient, signalling, system, described, that, does, meet, these, criteria, that, was, a, system, using, the, polybius, square, to, encode, an, alphabet, polybius, 2nd, century, bc, suggested, using, two, successive, groups, of, torches, to, identify, the, coordinates, of, the, letter, of, the, alphabet, being, transmitted, the, number, of, said, torches, held, up, signalled, the, grid, square, that, contained, the, letter, there, is, no, definite, record, of, the, system, ever, being, used, but, there, are, several, passages, in, ancient, texts, that, some, think, are, suggestive, holzmann, and, pehrson, for, instance, suggest, that, livy, is, describing, its, use, by, philip, v, of, macedon, in, 207, bc, during, the, first, macedonian, war, nothing, else, that, could, be, described, as, a, true, telegraph, existed, until, the, 17th, century, 26, 29, possibly, the, first, alphabetic, telegraph, code, in, the, modern, era, is, due, to, franz, kessler, who, published, his, work, in, 1616, kessler, used, a, lamp, placed, inside, a, barrel, with, a, moveable, shutter, operated, by, the, signaller, the, signals, were, observed, at, a, distance, with, the, newly, invented, telescope, 32, 34, an, optical, telegraph, is, a, telegraph, consisting, of, a, line, of, stations, in, towers, or, natural, high, points, which, signal, to, each, other, by, means, of, shutters, or, paddles, signalling, by, means, of, indicator, pointers, was, called, semaphore, early, proposals, for, an, optical, telegraph, system, were, made, to, the, royal, society, by, robert, hooke, in, 1684, and, were, first, implemented, on, an, experimental, level, by, sir, richard, lovell, edgeworth, in, 1767, the, first, successful, optical, telegraph, network, was, invented, by, claude, chappe, and, operated, in, france, from, 1793, the, two, most, extensive, systems, were, chappe, s, in, france, with, branches, into, neighbouring, countries, and, the, system, of, abraham, niclas, edelcrantz, in, sweden, ix, x, 47, during, 1790, 1795, at, the, height, of, the, french, revolution, france, needed, a, swift, and, reliable, communication, system, to, thwart, the, war, efforts, of, its, enemies, in, 1790, the, chappe, brothers, set, about, devising, a, system, of, communication, that, would, allow, the, central, government, to, receive, intelligence, and, to, transmit, orders, in, the, shortest, possible, time, on, 2, march, 1791, at, 11, am, they, sent, the, message, si, vous, r, ussissez, vous, serez, bient, t, couverts, de, gloire, if, you, succeed, you, will, soon, bask, in, glory, between, brulon, and, parce, a, distance, of, 16, kilometres, 10, mi, the, first, means, used, a, combination, of, black, and, white, panels, clocks, telescopes, and, codebooks, to, send, their, message, in, 1792, claude, was, appointed, ing, nieur, t, l, graphiste, and, charged, with, establishing, a, line, of, stations, between, paris, and, lille, a, distance, of, 230, kilometres, 140, mi, it, was, used, to, carry, dispatches, for, the, war, between, france, and, austria, in, 1794, it, brought, news, of, a, french, capture, of, cond, sur, l, escaut, from, the, austrians, less, than, an, hour, after, it, occurred, a, decision, to, replace, the, system, with, an, electric, telegraph, was, made, in, 1846, but, it, took, a, decade, before, it, was, fully, taken, out, of, service, the, fall, of, sevastopol, was, reported, by, chappe, telegraph, in, 1855, 92, 94, the, prussian, system, was, put, into, effect, in, the, 1830s, however, they, were, highly, dependent, on, good, weather, and, daylight, to, work, and, even, then, could, accommodate, only, about, two, words, per, minute, the, last, commercial, semaphore, link, ceased, operation, in, sweden, in, 1880, as, of, 1895, france, still, operated, coastal, commercial, semaphore, telegraph, stations, for, ship, to, shore, communication, the, early, ideas, for, an, electric, telegraph, included, in, 1753, using, electrostatic, deflections, of, pith, balls, proposals, for, electrochemical, bubbles, in, acid, by, campillo, in, 1804, and, von, s, mmering, in, 1809, the, first, experimental, system, over, a, substantial, distance, was, by, ronalds, in, 1816, using, an, electrostatic, generator, ronalds, offered, his, invention, to, the, british, admiralty, but, it, was, rejected, as, unnecessary, the, existing, optical, telegraph, connecting, the, admiralty, in, london, to, their, main, fleet, base, in, portsmouth, being, deemed, adequate, for, their, purposes, as, late, as, 1844, after, the, electrical, telegraph, had, come, into, use, the, admiralty, s, optical, telegraph, was, still, used, although, it, was, accepted, that, poor, weather, ruled, it, out, on, many, days, of, the, year, 16, 37, france, had, an, extensive, optical, telegraph, system, dating, from, napoleonic, times, and, was, even, slower, to, take, up, electrical, systems, 217, 218, eventually, electrostatic, telegraphs, were, abandoned, in, favour, of, electromagnetic, systems, an, early, experimental, system, schilling, 1832, led, to, a, proposal, to, establish, a, telegraph, between, st, petersburg, and, kronstadt, but, it, was, never, completed, the, first, operative, electric, telegraph, gauss, and, weber, 1833, connected, g, ttingen, observatory, to, the, institute, of, physics, about, 1, km, away, during, experimental, investigations, of, the, geomagnetic, field, the, first, commercial, telegraph, was, by, cooke, and, wheatstone, following, their, english, patent, of, 10, june, 1837, it, was, demonstrated, on, the, london, and, birmingham, railway, in, july, of, the, same, year, in, july, 1839, a, five, needle, five, wire, system, was, installed, to, provide, signalling, over, a, record, distance, of, 21, km, on, a, section, of, the, great, western, railway, between, london, paddington, station, and, west, drayton, however, in, trying, to, get, railway, companies, to, take, up, his, telegraph, more, widely, for, railway, signalling, cooke, was, rejected, several, times, in, favour, of, the, more, familiar, but, shorter, range, steam, powered, pneumatic, signalling, even, when, his, telegraph, was, taken, up, it, was, considered, experimental, and, the, company, backed, out, of, a, plan, to, finance, extending, the, telegraph, line, out, to, slough, however, this, led, to, a, breakthrough, for, the, electric, telegraph, as, up, to, this, point, the, great, western, had, insisted, on, exclusive, use, and, refused, cooke, permission, to, open, public, telegraph, offices, cooke, extended, the, line, at, his, own, expense, and, agreed, that, the, railway, could, have, free, use, of, it, in, exchange, for, the, right, to, open, it, up, to, the, public, 19, 20, most, of, the, early, electrical, systems, required, multiple, wires, ronalds, system, was, an, exception, but, the, system, developed, in, the, united, states, by, morse, and, vail, was, a, single, wire, system, this, was, the, system, that, first, used, the, soon, to, become, ubiquitous, morse, code, by, 1844, the, morse, system, connected, baltimore, to, washington, and, by, 1861, the, west, coast, of, the, continent, was, connected, to, the, east, coast, the, cooke, and, wheatstone, telegraph, in, a, series, of, improvements, also, ended, up, with, a, one, wire, system, but, still, using, their, own, code, and, needle, displays, the, electric, telegraph, quickly, became, a, means, of, more, general, communication, the, morse, system, was, officially, adopted, as, the, standard, for, continental, european, telegraphy, in, 1851, with, a, revised, code, which, later, became, the, basis, of, international, morse, code, however, great, britain, and, the, british, empire, continued, to, use, the, cooke, and, wheatstone, system, in, some, places, as, late, as, the, 1930s, likewise, the, united, states, continued, to, use, american, morse, code, internally, requiring, translation, operators, skilled, in, both, codes, for, international, messages, railway, signal, telegraphy, was, developed, in, britain, from, the, 1840s, onward, it, was, used, to, manage, railway, traffic, and, to, prevent, accidents, as, part, of, the, railway, signalling, system, on, 12, june, 1837, cooke, and, wheatstone, were, awarded, a, patent, for, an, electric, telegraph, this, was, demonstrated, between, euston, railway, station, where, wheatstone, was, located, and, the, engine, house, at, camden, town, where, cooke, was, stationed, together, with, robert, stephenson, the, london, and, birmingham, railway, line, s, chief, engineer, the, messages, were, for, the, operation, of, the, rope, haulage, system, for, pulling, trains, up, the, 1, in, 77, bank, the, world, s, first, permanent, railway, telegraph, was, completed, in, july, 1839, between, london, paddington, and, west, drayton, on, the, great, western, railway, with, an, electric, telegraph, using, a, four, needle, system, the, concept, of, a, signalling, block, system, was, proposed, by, cooke, in, 1842, railway, signal, telegraphy, did, not, change, in, essence, from, cooke, s, initial, concept, for, more, than, a, century, in, this, system, each, line, of, railway, was, divided, into, sections, or, blocks, of, varying, length, entry, to, and, exit, from, the, block, was, to, be, authorised, by, electric, telegraph, and, signalled, by, the, line, side, semaphore, signals, so, that, only, a, single, train, could, occupy, the, rails, in, cooke, s, original, system, a, single, needle, telegraph, was, adapted, to, indicate, just, two, messages, line, clear, and, line, blocked, the, signaller, would, adjust, his, line, side, signals, accordingly, as, first, implemented, in, 1844, each, station, had, as, many, needles, as, there, were, stations, on, the, line, giving, a, complete, picture, of, the, traffic, as, lines, expanded, a, sequence, of, pairs, of, single, needle, instruments, were, adopted, one, pair, for, each, block, in, each, direction, wigwag, is, a, form, of, flag, signalling, using, a, single, flag, unlike, most, forms, of, flag, signalling, which, are, used, over, relatively, short, distances, wigwag, is, designed, to, maximise, the, distance, covered, up, to, 32, km, 20, mi, in, some, cases, wigwag, achieved, this, by, using, a, large, flag, a, single, flag, can, be, held, with, both, hands, unlike, flag, semaphore, which, has, a, flag, in, each, hand, and, using, motions, rather, than, positions, as, its, symbols, since, motions, are, more, easily, seen, it, was, invented, by, us, army, surgeon, albert, j, myer, in, the, 1850s, who, later, became, the, first, head, of, the, signal, corps, wigwag, was, used, extensively, during, the, american, civil, war, where, it, filled, a, gap, left, by, the, electrical, telegraph, although, the, electrical, telegraph, had, been, in, use, for, more, than, a, decade, the, network, did, not, yet, reach, everywhere, and, portable, ruggedized, equipment, suitable, for, military, use, was, not, immediately, available, permanent, or, semi, permanent, stations, were, established, during, the, war, some, of, them, towers, of, enormous, height, and, the, system, was, extensive, enough, to, be, described, as, a, communications, network, a, heliograph, is, a, telegraph, that, transmits, messages, by, flashing, sunlight, with, a, mirror, usually, using, morse, code, the, idea, for, a, telegraph, of, this, type, was, first, proposed, as, a, modification, of, surveying, equipment, gauss, 1821, various, uses, of, mirrors, were, made, for, communication, in, the, following, years, mostly, for, military, purposes, but, the, first, device, to, become, widely, used, was, a, heliograph, with, a, moveable, mirror, mance, 1869, the, system, was, used, by, the, french, during, the, 1870, 71, siege, of, paris, with, night, time, signalling, using, kerosene, lamps, as, the, source, of, light, an, improved, version, begbie, 1870, was, used, by, british, military, in, many, colonial, wars, including, the, anglo, zulu, war, 1879, at, some, point, a, morse, key, was, added, to, the, apparatus, to, give, the, operator, the, same, degree, of, control, as, in, the, electric, telegraph, another, type, of, heliograph, was, the, heliostat, or, heliotrope, fitted, with, a, colomb, shutter, the, heliostat, was, essentially, a, surveying, instrument, with, a, fixed, mirror, and, so, could, not, transmit, a, code, by, itself, the, term, heliostat, is, sometimes, used, as, a, synonym, for, heliograph, because, of, this, origin, the, colomb, shutter, bolton, and, colomb, 1862, was, originally, invented, to, enable, the, transmission, of, morse, code, by, signal, lamp, between, royal, navy, ships, at, sea, the, heliograph, was, heavily, used, by, nelson, a, miles, in, arizona, and, new, mexico, after, he, took, over, command, 1886, of, the, fight, against, geronimo, and, other, apache, bands, in, the, apache, wars, miles, had, previously, set, up, the, first, heliograph, line, in, the, us, between, fort, keogh, and, fort, custer, in, montana, he, used, the, heliograph, to, fill, in, vast, thinly, populated, areas, that, were, not, covered, by, the, electric, telegraph, twenty, six, stations, covered, an, area, 320, by, 480, km, 200, by, 300, mi, in, a, test, of, the, system, a, message, was, relayed, 640, km, 400, mi, in, four, hours, miles, enemies, used, smoke, signals, and, flashes, of, sunlight, from, metal, but, lacked, a, sophisticated, telegraph, code, the, heliograph, was, ideal, for, use, in, the, american, southwest, due, to, its, clear, air, and, mountainous, terrain, on, which, stations, could, be, located, it, was, found, necessary, to, lengthen, the, morse, dash, which, is, much, shorter, in, american, morse, code, than, in, the, modern, international, morse, code, to, aid, differentiating, from, the, morse, dot, use, of, the, heliograph, declined, from, 1915, onwards, but, remained, in, service, in, britain, and, british, commonwealth, countries, for, some, time, australian, forces, used, the, heliograph, as, late, as, 1942, in, the, western, desert, campaign, of, world, war, ii, some, form, of, heliograph, was, used, by, the, mujahideen, in, the, soviet, afghan, war, 1979, 1989, a, teleprinter, is, a, telegraph, machine, that, can, send, messages, from, a, typewriter, like, keyboard, and, print, incoming, messages, in, readable, text, with, no, need, for, the, operators, to, be, trained, in, the, telegraph, code, used, on, the, line, it, developed, from, various, earlier, printing, telegraphs, and, resulted, in, improved, transmission, speeds, the, morse, telegraph, 1837, was, originally, conceived, as, a, system, marking, indentations, on, paper, tape, a, chemical, telegraph, making, blue, marks, improved, the, speed, of, recording, bain, 1846, but, was, delayed, by, a, patent, challenge, from, morse, the, first, true, printing, telegraph, that, is, printing, in, plain, text, used, a, spinning, wheel, of, types, in, the, manner, of, a, daisy, wheel, printer, house, 1846, improved, by, hughes, 1855, the, system, was, adopted, by, western, union, early, teleprinters, used, the, baudot, code, a, five, bit, sequential, binary, code, this, was, a, telegraph, code, developed, for, use, on, the, french, telegraph, using, a, five, key, keyboard, baudot, 1874, teleprinters, generated, the, same, code, from, a, full, alphanumeric, keyboard, a, feature, of, the, baudot, code, and, subsequent, telegraph, codes, was, that, unlike, morse, code, every, character, has, a, code, of, the, same, length, making, it, more, machine, friendly, the, baudot, code, was, used, on, the, earliest, ticker, tape, machines, calahan, 1867, a, system, for, mass, distributing, information, on, current, price, of, publicly, listed, companies, in, a, punched, tape, system, the, message, is, first, typed, onto, punched, tape, using, the, code, of, the, telegraph, system, morse, code, for, instance, it, is, then, either, immediately, or, at, some, later, time, run, through, a, transmission, machine, which, sends, the, message, to, the, telegraph, network, multiple, messages, can, be, sequentially, recorded, on, the, same, run, of, tape, the, advantage, of, doing, this, is, that, messages, can, be, sent, at, a, steady, fast, rate, making, maximum, use, of, the, available, telegraph, lines, the, economic, advantage, of, doing, this, is, greatest, on, long, busy, routes, where, the, cost, of, the, extra, step, of, preparing, the, tape, is, outweighed, by, the, cost, of, providing, more, telegraph, lines, the, first, machine, to, use, punched, tape, was, bain, s, teleprinter, bain, 1843, but, the, system, saw, only, limited, use, later, versions, of, bain, s, system, achieved, speeds, up, to, 1000, words, per, minute, far, faster, than, a, human, operator, could, achieve, the, first, widely, used, system, wheatstone, 1858, was, first, put, into, service, with, the, british, general, post, office, in, 1867, a, novel, feature, of, the, wheatstone, system, was, the, use, of, bipolar, encoding, that, is, both, positive, and, negative, polarity, voltages, were, used, bipolar, encoding, has, several, advantages, one, of, which, is, that, it, permits, duplex, communication, the, wheatstone, tape, reader, was, capable, of, a, speed, of, 400, words, per, minute, 190, a, worldwide, communication, network, meant, that, telegraph, cables, would, have, to, be, laid, across, oceans, on, land, cables, could, be, run, uninsulated, suspended, from, poles, underwater, a, good, insulator, that, was, both, flexible, and, capable, of, resisting, the, ingress, of, seawater, was, required, a, solution, presented, itself, with, gutta, percha, a, natural, rubber, from, the, palaquium, gutta, tree, after, william, montgomerie, sent, samples, to, london, from, singapore, in, 1843, the, new, material, was, tested, by, michael, faraday, and, in, 1845, wheatstone, suggested, that, it, should, be, used, on, the, cable, planned, between, dover, and, calais, by, john, watkins, brett, the, idea, was, proved, viable, when, the, south, eastern, railway, company, successfully, tested, a, three, kilometre, two, mile, gutta, percha, insulated, cable, with, telegraph, messages, to, a, ship, off, the, coast, of, folkestone, the, cable, to, france, was, laid, in, 1850, but, was, almost, immediately, severed, by, a, french, fishing, vessel, it, was, relaid, the, next, year, and, connections, to, ireland, and, the, low, countries, soon, followed, getting, a, cable, across, the, atlantic, ocean, proved, much, more, difficult, the, atlantic, telegraph, company, formed, in, london, in, 1856, had, several, failed, attempts, a, cable, laid, in, 1858, worked, poorly, for, a, few, days, sometimes, taking, all, day, to, send, a, message, despite, the, use, of, the, highly, sensitive, mirror, galvanometer, developed, by, william, thomson, the, future, lord, kelvin, before, being, destroyed, by, applying, too, high, a, voltage, its, failure, and, slow, speed, of, transmission, prompted, thomson, and, oliver, heaviside, to, find, better, mathematical, descriptions, of, long, transmission, lines, the, company, finally, succeeded, in, 1866, with, an, improved, cable, laid, by, ss, great, eastern, the, largest, ship, of, its, day, designed, by, isambard, kingdom, brunel, an, overland, telegraph, from, britain, to, india, was, first, connected, in, 1866, but, was, unreliable, so, a, submarine, telegraph, cable, was, connected, in, 1870, several, telegraph, companies, were, combined, to, form, the, eastern, telegraph, company, in, 1872, australia, was, first, linked, to, the, rest, of, the, world, in, october, 1872, by, a, submarine, telegraph, cable, at, darwin, from, the, 1850s, until, well, into, the, 20th, century, british, submarine, cable, systems, dominated, the, world, system, this, was, set, out, as, a, formal, strategic, goal, which, became, known, as, the, all, red, line, in, 1896, there, were, thirty, cable, laying, ships, in, the, world, and, twenty, four, of, them, were, owned, by, british, companies, in, 1892, british, companies, owned, and, operated, two, thirds, of, the, world, s, cables, and, by, 1923, their, share, was, still, 42, 7, percent, during, world, war, i, britain, s, telegraph, communications, were, almost, completely, uninterrupted, while, it, was, able, to, quickly, cut, germany, s, cables, worldwide, in, 1843, scottish, inventor, alexander, bain, invented, a, device, that, could, be, considered, the, first, facsimile, machine, he, called, his, invention, a, recording, telegraph, bain, s, telegraph, was, able, to, transmit, images, by, electrical, wires, frederick, bakewell, made, several, improvements, on, bain, s, design, and, demonstrated, a, telefax, machine, in, 1855, an, italian, priest, giovanni, caselli, also, created, an, electric, telegraph, that, could, transmit, images, caselli, called, his, invention, pantelegraph, pantelegraph, was, successfully, tested, and, approved, for, a, telegraph, line, between, paris, and, lyon, in, 1881, english, inventor, shelford, bidwell, constructed, the, scanning, phototelegraph, that, was, the, first, telefax, machine, to, scan, any, two, dimensional, original, not, requiring, manual, plotting, or, drawing, around, 1900, german, physicist, arthur, korn, invented, the, bildtelegraph, widespread, in, continental, europe, especially, since, a, widely, noticed, transmission, of, a, wanted, person, photograph, from, paris, to, london, in, 1908, used, until, the, wider, distribution, of, the, radiofax, its, main, competitors, were, the, b, linographe, by, douard, belin, first, then, since, the, 1930s, the, hellschreiber, invented, in, 1929, by, german, inventor, rudolf, hell, a, pioneer, in, mechanical, image, scanning, and, transmission, the, late, 1880s, through, to, the, 1890s, saw, the, discovery, and, then, development, of, a, newly, understood, phenomenon, into, a, form, of, wireless, telegraphy, called, hertzian, wave, wireless, telegraphy, radiotelegraphy, or, later, simply, radio, between, 1886, and, 1888, heinrich, rudolf, hertz, published, the, results, of, his, experiments, where, he, was, able, to, transmit, electromagnetic, waves, radio, waves, through, the, air, proving, james, clerk, maxwell, s, 1873, theory, of, electromagnetic, radiation, many, scientists, and, inventors, experimented, with, this, new, phenomenon, but, the, consensus, was, that, these, new, waves, similar, to, light, would, be, just, as, short, range, as, light, and, therefore, useless, for, long, range, communication, at, the, end, of, 1894, the, young, italian, inventor, guglielmo, marconi, began, working, on, the, idea, of, building, a, commercial, wireless, telegraphy, system, based, on, the, use, of, hertzian, waves, radio, waves, a, line, of, inquiry, that, he, noted, other, inventors, did, not, seem, to, be, pursuing, building, on, the, ideas, of, previous, scientists, and, inventors, marconi, re, engineered, their, apparatus, by, trial, and, error, attempting, to, build, a, radio, based, wireless, telegraphic, system, that, would, function, the, same, as, wired, telegraphy, he, would, work, on, the, system, through, 1895, in, his, lab, and, then, in, field, tests, making, improvements, to, extend, its, range, after, many, breakthroughs, including, applying, the, wired, telegraphy, concept, of, grounding, the, transmitter, and, receiver, marconi, was, able, by, early, 1896, to, transmit, radio, far, beyond, the, short, ranges, that, had, been, predicted, having, failed, to, interest, the, italian, government, the, 22, year, old, inventor, brought, his, telegraphy, system, to, britain, in, 1896, and, met, william, preece, a, welshman, who, was, a, major, figure, in, the, field, and, chief, engineer, of, the, general, post, office, a, series, of, demonstrations, for, the, british, government, followed, by, march, 1897, marconi, had, transmitted, morse, code, signals, over, a, distance, of, about, 6, km, 3, 1, 2, mi, across, salisbury, plain, on, 13, may, 1897, marconi, assisted, by, george, kemp, a, cardiff, post, office, engineer, transmitted, the, first, wireless, signals, over, water, to, lavernock, near, penarth, in, wales, from, flat, holm, his, star, rising, he, was, soon, sending, signals, across, the, english, channel, 1899, from, shore, to, ship, 1899, and, finally, across, the, atlantic, 1901, a, study, of, these, demonstrations, of, radio, with, scientists, trying, to, work, out, how, a, phenomenon, predicted, to, have, a, short, range, could, transmit, over, the, horizon, led, to, the, discovery, of, a, radio, reflecting, layer, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, in, 1902, later, called, the, ionosphere, radiotelegraphy, proved, effective, for, rescue, work, in, sea, disasters, by, enabling, effective, communication, between, ships, and, from, ship, to, shore, in, 1904, marconi, began, the, first, commercial, service, to, transmit, nightly, news, summaries, to, subscribing, ships, which, could, incorporate, them, into, their, on, board, newspapers, a, regular, transatlantic, radio, telegraph, service, was, finally, begun, on, 17, october, 1907, notably, marconi, s, apparatus, was, used, to, help, rescue, efforts, after, the, sinking, of, rms, titanic, britain, s, postmaster, general, summed, up, referring, to, the, titanic, disaster, those, who, have, been, saved, have, been, saved, through, one, man, mr, marconi, and, his, marvellous, invention, the, successful, development, of, radiotelegraphy, was, preceded, by, a, 50, year, history, of, ingenious, but, ultimately, unsuccessful, experiments, by, inventors, to, achieve, wireless, telegraphy, by, other, means, several, wireless, electrical, signaling, schemes, based, on, the, sometimes, erroneous, idea, that, electric, currents, could, be, conducted, long, range, through, water, ground, and, air, were, investigated, for, telegraphy, before, practical, radio, systems, became, available, the, original, telegraph, lines, used, two, wires, between, the, two, stations, to, form, a, complete, electrical, circuit, or, loop, in, 1837, however, carl, august, von, steinheil, of, munich, germany, found, that, by, connecting, one, leg, of, the, apparatus, at, each, station, to, metal, plates, buried, in, the, ground, he, could, eliminate, one, wire, and, use, a, single, wire, for, telegraphic, communication, this, led, to, speculation, that, it, might, be, possible, to, eliminate, both, wires, and, therefore, transmit, telegraph, signals, through, the, ground, without, any, wires, connecting, the, stations, other, attempts, were, made, to, send, the, electric, current, through, bodies, of, water, to, span, rivers, for, example, prominent, experimenters, along, these, lines, included, samuel, f, b, morse, in, the, united, states, and, james, bowman, lindsay, in, great, britain, who, in, august, 1854, was, able, to, demonstrate, transmission, across, a, mill, dam, at, a, distance, of, 500, yards, 457, metres, us, inventors, william, henry, ward, 1871, and, mahlon, loomis, 1872, developed, electrical, conduction, systems, based, on, the, erroneous, belief, that, there, was, an, electrified, atmospheric, stratum, accessible, at, low, altitude, they, thought, atmosphere, current, connected, with, a, return, path, using, earth, currents, would, allow, for, wireless, telegraphy, as, well, as, supply, power, for, the, telegraph, doing, away, with, artificial, batteries, a, more, practical, demonstration, of, wireless, transmission, via, conduction, came, in, amos, dolbear, s, 1879, magneto, electric, telephone, that, used, ground, conduction, to, transmit, over, a, distance, of, a, quarter, of, a, mile, in, the, 1890s, inventor, nikola, tesla, worked, on, an, air, and, ground, conduction, wireless, electric, power, transmission, system, similar, to, loomis, which, he, planned, to, include, wireless, telegraphy, tesla, s, experiments, had, led, him, to, incorrectly, conclude, that, he, could, use, the, entire, globe, of, the, earth, to, conduct, electrical, energy, and, his, 1901, large, scale, application, of, his, ideas, a, high, voltage, wireless, power, station, now, called, wardenclyffe, tower, lost, funding, and, was, abandoned, after, a, few, years, telegraphic, communication, using, earth, conductivity, was, eventually, found, to, be, limited, to, impractically, short, distances, as, was, communication, conducted, through, water, or, between, trenches, during, world, war, i, both, electrostatic, and, electromagnetic, induction, were, used, to, develop, wireless, telegraph, systems, that, saw, limited, commercial, application, in, the, united, states, thomas, edison, in, the, mid, 1880s, patented, an, electromagnetic, induction, system, he, called, grasshopper, telegraphy, which, allowed, telegraphic, signals, to, jump, the, short, distance, between, a, running, train, and, telegraph, wires, running, parallel, to, the, tracks, this, system, was, successful, technically, but, not, economically, as, there, turned, out, to, be, little, interest, by, train, travelers, in, the, use, of, an, on, board, telegraph, service, during, the, great, blizzard, of, 1888, this, system, was, used, to, send, and, receive, wireless, messages, from, trains, buried, in, snowdrifts, the, disabled, trains, were, able, to, maintain, communications, via, their, edison, induction, wireless, telegraph, systems, perhaps, the, first, successful, use, of, wireless, telegraphy, to, send, distress, calls, edison, would, also, help, to, patent, a, ship, to, shore, communication, system, based, on, electrostatic, induction, the, most, successful, creator, of, an, electromagnetic, induction, telegraph, system, was, william, preece, chief, engineer, of, post, office, telegraphs, of, the, general, post, office, gpo, in, the, united, kingdom, preece, first, noticed, the, effect, in, 1884, when, overhead, telegraph, wires, in, grays, inn, road, were, accidentally, carrying, messages, sent, on, buried, cables, tests, in, newcastle, succeeded, in, sending, a, quarter, of, a, mile, using, parallel, rectangles, of, wire, 243, in, tests, across, the, bristol, channel, in, 1892, preece, was, able, to, telegraph, across, gaps, of, about, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, miles, however, his, induction, system, required, extensive, lengths, of, antenna, wires, many, kilometers, long, at, both, the, sending, and, receiving, ends, the, length, of, those, sending, and, receiving, wires, needed, to, be, about, the, same, length, as, the, width, of, the, water, or, land, to, be, spanned, for, example, for, preece, s, station, to, span, the, english, channel, from, dover, england, to, the, coast, of, france, would, require, sending, and, receiving, wires, of, about, 30, miles, 48, kilometres, along, the, two, coasts, these, facts, made, the, system, impractical, on, ships, boats, and, ordinary, islands, which, are, much, smaller, than, great, britain, or, greenland, also, the, relatively, short, distances, that, a, practical, preece, system, could, span, meant, that, it, had, few, advantages, over, underwater, telegraph, cables, a, telegram, service, is, a, company, or, public, entity, that, delivers, telegraphed, messages, directly, to, the, recipient, telegram, services, were, not, inaugurated, until, electric, telegraphy, became, available, earlier, optical, systems, were, largely, limited, to, official, government, and, military, purposes, historically, telegrams, were, sent, between, a, network, of, interconnected, telegraph, offices, a, person, visiting, a, local, telegraph, office, paid, by, the, word, to, have, a, message, telegraphed, to, another, office, and, delivered, to, the, addressee, on, a, paper, form, 276, messages, i, e, telegrams, sent, by, telegraph, could, be, delivered, by, telegram, messenger, faster, than, mail, and, even, in, the, telephone, age, the, telegram, remained, popular, for, social, and, business, correspondence, at, their, peak, in, 1929, an, estimated, 200, million, telegrams, were, sent, 274, in, 1919, the, central, bureau, for, registered, addresses, was, established, in, the, financial, district, of, new, york, city, the, bureau, was, created, to, ease, the, growing, problem, of, messages, being, delivered, to, the, wrong, recipients, to, combat, this, issue, the, bureau, offered, telegraph, customers, the, option, to, register, unique, code, names, for, their, telegraph, addresses, customers, were, charged, 2, 50, per, year, per, code, by, 1934, 28, 000, codes, had, been, registered, telegram, services, still, operate, in, much, of, the, world, see, worldwide, use, of, telegrams, by, country, but, e, mail, and, text, messaging, have, rendered, telegrams, obsolete, in, many, countries, and, the, number, of, telegrams, sent, annually, has, been, declining, rapidly, since, the, 1980s, where, telegram, services, still, exist, the, transmission, method, between, offices, is, no, longer, by, telegraph, but, by, telex, or, ip, link, as, telegrams, have, been, traditionally, charged, by, the, word, messages, were, often, abbreviated, to, pack, information, into, the, smallest, possible, number, of, words, in, what, came, to, be, called, telegram, style, the, average, length, of, a, telegram, in, the, 1900s, in, the, us, was, 11, 93, words, more, than, half, of, the, messages, were, 10, words, or, fewer, according, to, another, study, the, mean, length, of, the, telegrams, sent, in, the, uk, before, 1950, was, 14, 6, words, or, 78, 8, characters, for, german, telegrams, the, mean, length, is, 11, 5, words, or, 72, 4, characters, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, average, length, of, a, german, telegram, was, calculated, as, 14, 2, words, telex, telegraph, exchange, was, a, public, switched, network, of, teleprinters, it, used, rotary, telephone, style, pulse, dialling, for, automatic, routing, through, the, network, it, initially, used, the, baudot, code, for, messages, telex, development, began, in, germany, in, 1926, becoming, an, operational, service, in, 1933, run, by, the, reichspost, the, german, imperial, postal, service, it, had, a, speed, of, 50, baud, approximately, 66, words, per, minute, up, to, 25, telex, channels, could, share, a, single, long, distance, telephone, channel, by, using, voice, frequency, telegraphy, multiplexing, making, telex, the, least, expensive, method, of, reliable, long, distance, communication, telex, was, introduced, into, canada, in, july, 1957, and, the, united, states, in, 1958, a, new, code, ascii, was, introduced, in, 1963, by, the, american, standards, association, ascii, was, a, seven, bit, code, and, could, thus, support, a, larger, number, of, characters, than, baudot, in, particular, ascii, supported, upper, and, lower, case, whereas, baudot, was, upper, case, only, telegraph, use, began, to, permanently, decline, around, 1920, 248, the, decline, began, with, the, growth, of, the, use, of, the, telephone, 253, ironically, the, invention, of, the, telephone, grew, out, of, the, development, of, the, harmonic, telegraph, a, device, which, was, supposed, to, increase, the, efficiency, of, telegraph, transmission, and, improve, the, profits, of, telegraph, companies, western, union, gave, up, its, patent, battle, with, alexander, graham, bell, because, it, believed, the, telephone, was, not, a, threat, to, its, telegraph, business, the, bell, telephone, company, was, formed, in, 1877, and, had, 230, subscribers, which, grew, to, 30, 000, by, 1880, by, 1886, there, were, a, quarter, of, a, million, phones, worldwide, 276, 277, and, nearly, 2, million, by, 1900, 204, the, decline, was, briefly, postponed, by, the, rise, of, special, occasion, congratulatory, telegrams, traffic, continued, to, grow, between, 1867, and, 1893, despite, the, introduction, of, the, telephone, in, this, period, 274, but, by, 1900, the, telegraph, was, definitely, in, decline, 277, there, was, a, brief, resurgence, in, telegraphy, during, world, war, i, but, the, decline, continued, as, the, world, entered, the, great, depression, years, of, the, 1930s, 277, after, the, second, world, war, new, technology, improved, communication, in, the, telegraph, industry, telegraph, lines, continued, to, be, an, important, means, of, distributing, news, feeds, from, news, agencies, by, teleprinter, machine, until, the, rise, of, the, internet, in, the, 1990s, for, western, union, one, service, remained, highly, profitable, the, wire, transfer, of, money, this, service, kept, western, union, in, business, long, after, the, telegraph, had, ceased, to, be, important, 277, in, the, modern, era, the, telegraph, that, began, in, 1837, has, been, gradually, replaced, by, digital, data, transmission, based, on, computer, information, systems, optical, telegraph, lines, were, installed, by, governments, often, for, a, military, purpose, and, reserved, for, official, use, only, in, many, countries, this, situation, continued, after, the, introduction, of, the, electric, telegraph, starting, in, germany, and, the, uk, electric, telegraph, lines, were, installed, by, railway, companies, railway, use, quickly, led, to, private, telegraph, companies, in, the, uk, and, the, us, offering, a, telegraph, service, to, the, public, using, telegraph, along, railway, lines, the, availability, of, this, new, form, of, communication, brought, on, widespread, social, and, economic, changes, the, electric, telegraph, freed, communication, from, the, time, constraints, of, postal, mail, and, revolutionized, the, global, economy, and, society, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, telegraph, was, becoming, an, increasingly, common, medium, of, communication, for, ordinary, people, the, telegraph, isolated, the, message, information, from, the, physical, movement, of, objects, or, the, process, there, was, some, fear, of, the, new, technology, according, to, author, allan, j, kimmel, some, people, feared, that, the, telegraph, would, erode, the, quality, of, public, discourse, through, the, transmission, of, irrelevant, context, free, information, henry, david, thoreau, thought, of, the, transatlantic, cable, perchance, the, first, news, that, will, leak, through, into, the, broad, flapping, american, ear, will, be, that, princess, adelaide, has, the, whooping, cough, kimmel, says, these, fears, anticipate, many, of, the, characteristics, of, the, modern, internet, age, initially, the, telegraph, was, expensive, but, it, had, an, enormous, effect, on, three, industries, finance, newspapers, and, railways, telegraphy, facilitated, the, growth, of, organizations, in, the, railroads, consolidated, financial, and, commodity, markets, and, reduced, information, costs, within, and, between, firms, in, the, us, there, were, 200, to, 300, stock, exchanges, before, the, telegraph, but, most, of, these, were, unnecessary, and, unprofitable, once, the, telegraph, made, financial, transactions, at, a, distance, easy, and, drove, down, transaction, costs, 274, 75, this, immense, growth, in, the, business, sectors, influenced, society, to, embrace, the, use, of, telegrams, once, the, cost, had, fallen, worldwide, telegraphy, changed, the, gathering, of, information, for, news, reporting, journalists, were, using, the, telegraph, for, war, reporting, as, early, as, 1846, when, the, mexican, american, war, broke, out, news, agencies, were, formed, such, as, the, associated, press, for, the, purpose, of, reporting, news, by, telegraph, 274, 75, messages, and, information, would, now, travel, far, and, wide, and, the, telegraph, demanded, a, language, stripped, of, the, local, the, regional, and, colloquial, to, better, facilitate, a, worldwide, media, language, media, language, had, to, be, standardized, which, led, to, the, gradual, disappearance, of, different, forms, of, speech, and, styles, of, journalism, and, storytelling, the, spread, of, the, railways, created, a, need, for, an, accurate, standard, time, to, replace, local, standards, based, on, local, noon, the, means, of, achieving, this, synchronisation, was, the, telegraph, this, emphasis, on, precise, time, has, led, to, major, societal, changes, such, as, the, concept, of, the, time, value, of, money, 273, 74, during, the, telegraph, era, there, was, widespread, employment, of, women, in, telegraphy, the, shortage, of, men, to, work, as, telegraph, operators, in, the, american, civil, war, opened, up, the, opportunity, for, women, of, a, well, paid, skilled, job, 274, in, the, uk, there, was, widespread, employment, of, women, as, telegraph, operators, even, earlier, from, the, 1850s, by, all, the, major, companies, the, attraction, of, women, for, the, telegraph, companies, was, that, they, could, pay, them, less, than, men, nevertheless, the, jobs, were, popular, with, women, for, the, same, reason, as, in, the, us, most, other, work, available, for, women, was, very, poorly, paid, 77, 85, the, economic, impact, of, the, telegraph, was, not, much, studied, by, economic, historians, until, parallels, started, to, be, drawn, with, the, rise, of, the, internet, in, fact, the, electric, telegraph, was, as, important, as, the, invention, of, printing, in, this, respect, according, to, economist, ronnie, j, phillips, the, reason, for, this, may, be, that, institutional, economists, paid, more, attention, to, advances, that, required, greater, capital, investment, the, investment, required, to, build, railways, for, instance, is, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, that, for, the, telegraph, 269, 70, the, optical, telegraph, was, quickly, forgotten, once, it, went, out, of, service, while, it, was, in, operation, it, was, very, familiar, to, the, public, across, europe, examples, appear, in, many, paintings, of, the, period, poems, include, le, tel, graphe, by, victor, hugo, and, the, collection, telegrafen, optisk, kalender, f, r, 1858, by, elias, sehlstedt, is, dedicated, to, the, telegraph, in, novels, the, telegraph, is, a, major, component, in, lucien, leuwen, by, stendhal, and, it, features, in, the, count, of, monte, cristo, by, alexandre, dumas, vii, ix, joseph, chudy, s, 1796, opera, der, telegraph, oder, die, fernschreibmaschine, was, written, to, publicise, chudy, s, telegraph, a, binary, code, with, five, lamps, when, it, became, clear, that, chappe, s, design, was, being, taken, up, 42, 43, rudyard, kipling, wrote, a, poem, in, praise, of, submarine, telegraph,
