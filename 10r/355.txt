a, siphon, from, ancient, greek, s, ph, n, pipe, tube, also, spelled, syphon, is, any, of, a, wide, variety, of, devices, that, involve, the, flow, of, liquids, through, tubes, in, a, narrower, sense, the, word, refers, particularly, to, a, tube, in, an, inverted, u, shape, which, causes, a, liquid, to, flow, upward, above, the, surface, of, a, reservoir, with, no, pump, but, powered, by, the, fall, of, the, liquid, as, it, flows, down, the, tube, under, the, pull, of, gravity, then, discharging, at, a, level, lower, than, the, surface, of, the, reservoir, from, which, it, came, there, are, two, leading, theories, about, how, siphons, cause, liquid, to, flow, uphill, against, gravity, without, being, pumped, and, powered, only, by, gravity, the, traditional, theory, for, centuries, was, that, gravity, pulling, the, liquid, down, on, the, exit, side, of, the, siphon, resulted, in, reduced, pressure, at, the, top, of, the, siphon, then, atmospheric, pressure, was, able, to, push, the, liquid, from, the, upper, reservoir, up, into, the, reduced, pressure, at, the, top, of, the, siphon, like, in, a, barometer, or, drinking, straw, and, then, over, however, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, siphons, can, operate, in, a, vacuum, and, to, heights, exceeding, the, barometric, height, of, the, liquid, consequently, the, cohesion, tension, theory, of, siphon, operation, has, been, advocated, where, the, liquid, is, pulled, over, the, siphon, in, a, way, similar, to, the, chain, fountain, it, need, not, be, one, theory, or, the, other, that, is, correct, but, rather, both, theories, may, be, correct, in, different, circumstances, of, ambient, pressure, the, atmospheric, pressure, with, gravity, theory, cannot, explain, siphons, in, vacuum, where, there, is, no, significant, atmospheric, pressure, but, the, cohesion, tension, with, gravity, theory, cannot, explain, co, 2, gas, siphons, siphons, working, despite, bubbles, and, the, flying, droplet, siphon, where, gases, do, not, exert, significant, pulling, forces, and, liquids, not, in, contact, cannot, exert, a, cohesive, tension, force, all, known, published, theories, in, modern, times, recognize, bernoulli, s, equation, as, a, decent, approximation, to, idealized, friction, free, siphon, operation, egyptian, reliefs, from, 1500, bc, depict, siphons, used, to, extract, liquids, from, large, storage, jars, physical, evidence, for, the, use, of, siphons, by, greeks, are, the, justice, cup, of, pythagoras, in, samos, in, the, 6th, century, bc, and, usage, by, greek, engineers, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, at, pergamon, hero, of, alexandria, wrote, extensively, about, siphons, in, the, treatise, pneumatica, the, banu, musa, brothers, of, 9th, century, baghdad, invented, a, double, concentric, siphon, which, they, described, in, their, book, of, ingenious, devices, the, edition, edited, by, hill, includes, an, analysis, of, the, double, concentric, siphon, siphons, were, studied, further, in, the, 17th, century, in, the, context, of, suction, pumps, and, the, recently, developed, vacuum, pumps, particularly, with, an, eye, to, understanding, the, maximum, height, of, pumps, and, siphons, and, the, apparent, vacuum, at, the, top, of, early, barometers, this, was, initially, explained, by, galileo, galilei, via, the, theory, of, horror, vacui, nature, abhors, a, vacuum, which, dates, to, aristotle, and, which, galileo, restated, as, resintenza, del, vacuo, but, this, was, subsequently, disproved, by, later, workers, notably, evangelista, torricelli, and, blaise, pascal, see, barometer, history, a, practical, siphon, operating, at, typical, atmospheric, pressures, and, tube, heights, works, because, gravity, pulling, down, on, the, taller, column, of, liquid, leaves, reduced, pressure, at, the, top, of, the, siphon, formally, hydrostatic, pressure, when, the, liquid, is, not, moving, this, reduced, pressure, at, the, top, means, gravity, pulling, down, on, the, shorter, column, of, liquid, is, not, sufficient, to, keep, the, liquid, stationary, against, the, atmospheric, pressure, pushing, it, up, into, the, reduced, pressure, zone, at, the, top, of, the, siphon, so, the, liquid, flows, from, the, higher, pressure, area, of, the, upper, reservoir, up, to, the, lower, pressure, zone, at, the, top, of, the, siphon, over, the, top, and, then, with, the, help, of, gravity, and, a, taller, column, of, liquid, down, to, the, higher, pressure, zone, at, the, exit, the, chain, model, is, a, useful, but, not, completely, accurate, conceptual, model, of, a, siphon, the, chain, model, helps, to, understand, how, a, siphon, can, cause, liquid, to, flow, uphill, powered, only, by, the, downward, force, of, gravity, a, siphon, can, sometimes, be, thought, of, like, a, chain, hanging, over, a, pulley, with, one, end, of, the, chain, piled, on, a, higher, surface, than, the, other, since, the, length, of, chain, on, the, shorter, side, is, lighter, than, the, length, of, chain, on, the, taller, side, the, heavier, chain, on, the, taller, side, will, move, down, and, pull, up, the, chain, on, the, lighter, side, similar, to, a, siphon, the, chain, model, is, obviously, just, powered, by, gravity, acting, on, the, heavier, side, and, there, is, clearly, no, violation, of, conservation, of, energy, because, the, chain, is, ultimately, just, moving, from, a, higher, to, a, lower, location, as, the, liquid, does, in, a, siphon, there, are, a, number, of, problems, with, the, chain, model, of, a, siphon, and, understanding, these, differences, helps, to, explain, the, actual, workings, of, siphons, first, unlike, in, the, chain, model, of, the, siphon, it, is, not, actually, the, weight, on, the, taller, side, compared, to, the, shorter, side, that, matters, rather, it, is, the, difference, in, height, from, the, reservoir, surfaces, to, the, top, of, the, siphon, that, determines, the, balance, of, pressure, for, example, if, the, tube, from, the, upper, reservoir, to, the, top, of, the, siphon, has, a, much, larger, diameter, than, the, taller, section, of, tube, from, the, lower, reservoir, to, the, top, of, the, siphon, the, shorter, upper, section, of, the, siphon, may, have, a, much, larger, weight, of, liquid, in, it, and, yet, the, lighter, volume, of, liquid, in, the, down, tube, can, pull, liquid, up, the, fatter, up, tube, and, the, siphon, can, function, normally, another, difference, is, that, under, most, practical, circumstances, dissolved, gases, vapor, pressure, and, sometimes, lack, of, adhesion, with, tube, walls, conspire, to, render, the, tensile, strength, within, the, liquid, ineffective, for, siphoning, thus, unlike, a, chain, which, has, significant, tensile, strength, liquids, usually, have, little, tensile, strength, under, typical, siphon, conditions, and, therefore, the, liquid, on, the, rising, side, cannot, be, pulled, up, in, the, way, the, chain, is, pulled, up, on, the, rising, side, an, occasional, misunderstanding, of, siphons, is, that, they, rely, on, the, tensile, strength, of, the, liquid, to, pull, the, liquid, up, and, over, the, rise, while, water, has, been, found, to, have, a, significant, tensile, strength, in, some, experiments, such, as, with, the, z, tube, and, siphons, in, vacuum, rely, on, such, cohesion, common, siphons, can, easily, be, demonstrated, to, need, no, liquid, tensile, strength, at, all, to, function, furthermore, since, common, siphons, operate, at, positive, pressures, throughout, the, siphon, there, is, no, contribution, from, liquid, tensile, strength, because, the, molecules, are, actually, repelling, each, other, in, order, to, resist, the, pressure, rather, than, pulling, on, each, other, to, demonstrate, the, longer, lower, leg, of, a, common, siphon, can, be, plugged, at, the, bottom, and, filled, almost, to, the, crest, with, liquid, as, in, the, figure, leaving, the, top, and, the, shorter, upper, leg, completely, dry, and, containing, only, air, when, the, plug, is, removed, and, the, liquid, in, the, longer, lower, leg, is, allowed, to, fall, the, liquid, in, the, upper, reservoir, will, then, typically, sweep, the, air, bubble, down, and, out, of, the, tube, the, apparatus, will, then, continue, to, operate, as, a, normal, siphon, as, there, is, no, contact, between, the, liquid, on, either, side, of, the, siphon, at, the, beginning, of, this, experiment, there, can, be, no, cohesion, between, the, liquid, molecules, to, pull, the, liquid, over, the, rise, it, has, been, suggested, by, advocates, of, the, liquid, tensile, strength, theory, that, the, air, start, siphon, only, demonstrates, the, effect, as, the, siphon, starts, but, that, the, situation, changes, after, the, bubble, is, swept, out, and, the, siphon, achieves, steady, flow, but, a, similar, effect, can, be, seen, in, the, flying, droplet, siphon, see, above, the, flying, droplet, siphon, works, continuously, without, liquid, tensile, strength, pulling, the, liquid, up, the, siphon, in, the, video, demonstration, operated, steadily, for, more, than, 28, minutes, until, the, upper, reservoir, was, empty, another, simple, demonstration, that, liquid, tensile, strength, is, not, needed, in, the, siphon, is, to, simply, introduce, a, bubble, into, the, siphon, during, operation, the, bubble, can, be, large, enough, to, entirely, disconnect, the, liquids, in, the, tube, before, and, after, the, bubble, defeating, any, liquid, tensile, strength, and, yet, if, the, bubble, is, not, too, big, the, siphon, will, continue, to, operate, with, little, change, as, it, sweeps, the, bubble, out, another, common, misconception, about, siphons, is, that, because, the, atmospheric, pressure, is, virtually, identical, at, the, entrance, and, exit, the, atmospheric, pressure, cancels, and, therefore, atmospheric, pressure, cannot, be, pushing, the, liquid, up, the, siphon, but, equal, and, opposite, forces, may, not, completely, cancel, if, there, is, an, intervening, force, that, counters, some, or, all, of, one, of, the, forces, in, the, siphon, the, atmospheric, pressure, at, the, entrance, and, exit, are, both, lessened, by, the, force, of, gravity, pulling, down, the, liquid, in, each, tube, but, the, pressure, on, the, down, side, is, lessened, more, by, the, taller, column, of, liquid, on, the, down, side, in, effect, the, atmospheric, pressure, coming, up, the, down, side, does, not, entirely, make, it, to, the, top, to, cancel, all, of, the, atmospheric, pressure, pushing, up, the, up, side, this, effect, can, be, seen, more, easily, in, the, example, of, two, carts, being, pushed, up, opposite, sides, of, a, hill, as, shown, in, the, diagram, even, though, the, person, on, the, left, seems, to, have, his, push, canceled, entirely, by, the, equal, and, opposite, push, from, the, person, on, the, right, the, person, on, the, left, s, seemingly, canceled, push, is, still, the, source, of, the, force, to, push, the, left, cart, up, in, some, situations, siphons, do, function, in, the, absence, of, atmospheric, pressure, and, due, to, tensile, strength, see, vacuum, siphons, and, in, these, situations, the, chain, model, can, be, instructive, further, in, other, settings, water, transport, does, occur, due, to, tension, most, significantly, in, transpirational, pull, in, the, xylem, of, vascular, plants, water, and, other, liquids, may, seem, to, have, no, tensile, strength, because, when, a, handful, is, scooped, up, and, pulled, on, the, liquids, narrow, and, pull, apart, effortlessly, but, liquid, tensile, strength, in, a, siphon, is, possible, when, the, liquid, adheres, to, the, tube, walls, and, thereby, resists, narrowing, any, contamination, on, the, tube, walls, such, as, grease, or, air, bubbles, or, other, minor, influences, such, as, turbulence, or, vibration, can, cause, the, liquid, to, detach, from, the, walls, and, lose, all, tensile, strength, in, more, detail, one, can, look, at, how, the, hydrostatic, pressure, varies, through, a, static, siphon, considering, in, turn, the, vertical, tube, from, the, top, reservoir, the, vertical, tube, from, the, bottom, reservoir, and, the, horizontal, tube, connecting, them, assuming, a, u, shape, at, liquid, level, in, the, top, reservoir, the, liquid, is, under, atmospheric, pressure, and, as, one, goes, up, the, siphon, the, hydrostatic, pressure, decreases, under, vertical, pressure, variation, since, the, weight, of, atmospheric, pressure, pushing, the, water, up, is, counterbalanced, by, the, column, of, water, in, the, siphon, pushing, down, until, one, reaches, the, maximal, height, of, a, barometer, siphon, at, which, point, the, liquid, cannot, be, pushed, higher, the, hydrostatic, pressure, at, the, top, of, the, tube, is, then, lower, than, atmospheric, pressure, by, an, amount, proportional, to, the, height, of, the, tube, doing, the, same, analysis, on, the, tube, rising, from, the, lower, reservoir, yields, the, pressure, at, the, top, of, that, vertical, tube, this, pressure, is, lower, because, the, tube, is, longer, there, is, more, water, pushing, down, and, requires, that, the, lower, reservoir, is, lower, than, the, upper, reservoir, or, more, generally, that, the, discharge, outlet, simply, be, lower, than, the, surface, of, the, upper, reservoir, considering, now, the, horizontal, tube, connecting, them, one, sees, that, the, pressure, at, the, top, of, the, tube, from, the, top, reservoir, is, higher, since, less, water, is, being, lifted, while, the, pressure, at, the, top, of, the, tube, from, the, bottom, reservoir, is, lower, since, more, water, is, being, lifted, and, since, liquids, move, from, high, pressure, to, low, pressure, the, liquid, flows, across, the, horizontal, tube, from, the, top, basin, to, the, bottom, basin, the, liquid, is, under, positive, pressure, compression, throughout, the, tube, not, tension, bernoulli, s, equation, is, considered, in, the, scientific, literature, to, be, a, fair, approximation, to, the, operation, of, the, siphon, in, non, ideal, fluids, compressibility, tensile, strength, and, other, characteristics, of, the, working, fluid, or, multiple, fluids, complicate, bernoulli, s, equation, once, started, a, siphon, requires, no, additional, energy, to, keep, the, liquid, flowing, up, and, out, of, the, reservoir, the, siphon, will, draw, liquid, out, of, the, reservoir, until, the, level, falls, below, the, intake, allowing, air, or, other, surrounding, gas, to, break, the, siphon, or, until, the, outlet, of, the, siphon, equals, the, level, of, the, reservoir, whichever, comes, first, in, addition, to, atmospheric, pressure, the, density, of, the, liquid, and, gravity, the, maximal, height, of, the, crest, in, practical, siphons, is, limited, by, the, vapour, pressure, of, the, liquid, when, the, pressure, within, the, liquid, drops, to, below, the, liquid, s, vapor, pressure, tiny, vapor, bubbles, can, begin, to, form, at, the, high, point, and, the, siphon, effect, will, end, this, effect, depends, on, how, efficiently, the, liquid, can, nucleate, bubbles, in, the, absence, of, impurities, or, rough, surfaces, to, act, as, easy, nucleation, sites, for, bubbles, siphons, can, temporarily, exceed, their, standard, maximal, height, during, the, extended, time, it, takes, bubbles, to, nucleate, one, siphon, of, degassed, water, was, demonstrated, to, 24, m, 79, feet, for, an, extended, period, of, time, and, other, controlled, experiments, to, 10, m, 33, feet, for, water, at, standard, atmospheric, pressure, the, maximal, siphon, height, is, approximately, 10, m, 33, feet, for, mercury, it, is, 76, cm, 30, inches, which, is, the, definition, of, standard, pressure, this, equals, the, maximal, height, of, a, suction, pump, which, operates, by, the, same, principle, the, ratio, of, heights, about, 13, 6, equals, the, ratio, of, densities, of, water, and, mercury, at, a, given, temperature, since, the, column, of, water, resp, mercury, is, balancing, with, the, column, of, air, yielding, atmospheric, pressure, and, indeed, maximal, height, is, neglecting, vapor, pressure, and, velocity, of, liquid, inversely, proportional, to, density, of, liquid, in, 1948, malcolm, nokes, investigated, siphons, working, in, both, air, pressure, and, in, a, partial, vacuum, for, siphons, in, vacuum, he, concluded, the, gravitational, force, on, the, column, of, liquid, in, the, downtake, tube, less, the, gravitational, force, in, the, uptake, tube, causes, the, liquid, to, move, the, liquid, is, therefore, in, tension, and, sustains, a, longitudinal, strain, which, in, the, absence, of, disturbing, factors, is, insufficient, to, break, the, column, of, liquid, but, for, siphons, of, small, uptake, height, working, at, atmospheric, pressure, he, wrote, the, tension, of, the, liquid, column, is, neutralized, and, reversed, by, the, compressive, effect, of, the, atmosphere, on, the, opposite, ends, of, the, liquid, column, potter, and, barnes, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, revisited, siphons, in, 1971, they, re, examined, the, theories, of, the, siphon, and, ran, experiments, on, siphons, in, air, pressure, they, concluded, by, now, it, should, be, clear, that, despite, a, wealth, of, tradition, the, basic, mechanism, of, a, siphon, does, not, depend, upon, atmospheric, pressure, gravity, pressure, and, molecular, cohesion, were, the, focus, of, work, in, 2010, by, hughes, at, the, queensland, university, of, technology, he, used, siphons, at, air, pressure, and, his, conclusion, was, the, flow, of, water, out, of, the, bottom, of, a, siphon, depends, on, the, difference, in, height, between, the, inflow, and, outflow, and, therefore, cannot, be, dependent, on, atmospheric, pressure, hughes, did, further, work, on, siphons, at, air, pressure, in, 2011, and, concluded, the, experiments, described, above, demonstrate, that, ordinary, siphons, at, atmospheric, pressure, operate, through, gravity, and, not, atmospheric, pressure, the, father, and, son, researchers, ramette, and, ramette, successfully, siphoned, carbon, dioxide, under, air, pressure, in, 2011, and, concluded, that, molecular, cohesion, is, not, required, for, the, operation, of, a, siphon, but, the, basic, explanation, of, siphon, action, is, that, once, the, tube, is, filled, the, flow, is, initiated, by, the, greater, pull, of, gravity, on, the, fluid, on, the, longer, side, compared, with, that, on, the, short, side, this, creates, a, pressure, drop, throughout, the, siphon, tube, in, the, same, sense, that, sucking, on, a, straw, reduces, the, pressure, along, its, length, all, the, way, to, the, intake, point, the, ambient, atmospheric, pressure, at, the, intake, point, responds, to, the, reduced, pressure, by, forcing, the, fluid, upwards, sustaining, the, flow, just, as, in, a, steadily, sucked, straw, in, a, milkshake, again, in, 2011, richert, and, binder, at, the, university, of, hawaii, examined, the, siphon, and, concluded, that, molecular, cohesion, is, not, required, for, the, operation, of, a, siphon, but, relies, upon, gravity, and, a, pressure, differential, writing, as, the, fluid, initially, primed, on, the, long, leg, of, the, siphon, rushes, down, due, to, gravity, it, leaves, behind, a, partial, vacuum, that, allows, pressure, on, the, entrance, point, of, the, higher, container, to, push, fluid, up, the, leg, on, that, side, the, research, team, of, boatwright, puttick, and, licence, all, at, the, university, of, nottingham, succeeded, in, running, a, siphon, in, high, vacuum, also, in, 2011, they, wrote, it, is, widely, believed, that, the, siphon, is, principally, driven, by, the, force, of, atmospheric, pressure, an, experiment, is, described, that, shows, that, a, siphon, can, function, even, under, high, vacuum, conditions, molecular, cohesion, and, gravity, are, shown, to, be, contributing, factors, in, the, operation, of, a, siphon, the, presence, of, a, positive, atmospheric, pressure, is, not, required, writing, in, physics, today, in, 2011, j, dooley, from, millersville, university, stated, that, both, a, pressure, differential, within, the, siphon, tube, and, the, tensile, strength, of, the, liquid, are, required, for, a, siphon, to, operate, a, researcher, at, humboldt, state, university, a, mcguire, examined, flow, in, siphons, in, 2012, using, the, advanced, general, purpose, multiphysics, simulation, software, package, ls, dyna, he, examined, pressure, initialisation, flow, and, pressure, propagation, within, a, siphon, he, concluded, pressure, gravity, and, molecular, cohesion, can, all, be, driving, forces, in, the, operation, of, siphons, in, 2014, hughes, and, gurung, at, the, queensland, university, of, technology, ran, a, water, siphon, under, varying, air, pressures, ranging, from, sea, level, to, 11, 9, km, 39, 000, ft, altitude, they, noted, flow, remained, more, or, less, constant, during, ascension, indicating, that, siphon, flow, is, independent, of, ambient, barometric, pressure, they, used, bernoulli, s, equation, and, the, poiseuille, equation, to, examine, pressure, differentials, and, fluid, flow, within, a, siphon, their, conclusion, was, it, follows, from, the, above, analysis, that, there, must, be, a, direct, cohesive, connection, between, water, molecules, flowing, in, and, out, of, a, siphon, this, is, true, at, all, atmospheric, pressures, in, which, the, pressure, in, the, apex, of, the, siphon, is, above, the, vapour, pressure, of, water, an, exception, being, ionic, liquids, a, plain, tube, can, be, used, as, a, siphon, an, external, pump, has, to, be, applied, to, start, the, liquid, flowing, and, prime, the, siphon, in, home, use, this, is, often, done, by, a, person, inhaling, through, the, tube, until, enough, of, it, has, filled, with, liquid, this, may, pose, danger, to, the, user, depending, on, the, liquid, that, is, being, siphoned, this, is, sometimes, done, with, any, leak, free, hose, to, siphon, gasoline, from, a, motor, vehicle, s, gasoline, tank, to, an, external, tank, siphoning, gasoline, by, mouth, often, results, in, the, accidental, swallowing, of, gasoline, or, aspirating, it, into, the, lungs, which, can, cause, death, or, lung, damage, if, the, tube, is, flooded, with, liquid, before, part, of, the, tube, is, raised, over, the, intermediate, high, point, and, care, is, taken, to, keep, the, tube, flooded, while, it, is, being, raised, no, pump, is, required, devices, sold, as, siphons, often, come, with, a, siphon, pump, to, start, the, siphon, process, in, some, applications, it, can, be, helpful, to, use, siphon, tubing, that, is, not, much, larger, than, necessary, using, piping, of, too, great, a, diameter, and, then, throttling, the, flow, using, valves, or, constrictive, piping, appears, to, increase, the, effect, of, previously, cited, concerns, over, gases, or, vapor, collecting, in, the, crest, which, serve, to, break, the, vacuum, if, the, vacuum, is, reduced, too, much, the, siphon, effect, can, be, lost, reducing, the, size, of, pipe, used, closer, to, requirements, appears, to, reduce, this, effect, and, creates, a, more, functional, siphon, that, does, not, require, constant, re, priming, and, restarting, in, this, respect, where, the, requirement, is, to, match, a, flow, into, a, container, with, a, flow, out, of, said, container, to, maintain, a, constant, level, in, a, pond, fed, by, a, stream, for, example, it, would, be, preferable, to, utilize, two, or, three, smaller, separate, parallel, pipes, that, can, be, started, as, required, rather, than, attempting, to, use, a, single, large, pipe, and, attempting, to, throttle, it, siphons, are, sometimes, employed, as, automatic, machines, in, situations, where, it, is, desirable, to, turn, a, continuous, trickling, flow, or, an, irregular, small, surge, flow, into, a, large, surge, volume, a, common, example, of, this, is, a, public, restroom, with, urinals, regularly, flushed, by, an, automatic, siphon, in, a, small, water, tank, overhead, when, the, container, is, filled, all, the, stored, liquid, is, released, emerging, as, a, large, surge, volume, that, then, resets, and, fills, again, one, way, to, do, this, intermittent, action, involves, complex, machinery, such, as, floats, chains, levers, and, valves, but, these, can, corrode, wear, out, or, jam, over, time, an, alternate, method, is, with, rigid, pipes, and, chambers, using, only, the, water, itself, in, a, siphon, as, the, operating, mechanism, a, siphon, used, in, an, automatic, unattended, device, needs, to, be, able, to, function, reliably, without, failure, this, is, different, from, the, common, demonstration, self, starting, siphons, in, that, there, are, ways, the, siphon, can, fail, to, function, which, require, manual, intervention, to, return, to, normal, surge, flow, operation, a, video, demonstration, of, a, self, starting, siphon, can, be, found, here, courtesy, of, the, curiosity, show, the, most, common, failure, is, for, the, liquid, to, dribble, out, slowly, matching, the, rate, that, the, container, is, filling, and, the, siphon, enters, an, undesired, steady, state, condition, preventing, dribbling, typically, involves, pneumatic, principles, to, trap, one, or, more, large, air, bubbles, in, various, pipes, which, are, sealed, by, water, traps, this, method, can, fail, if, it, cannot, start, working, intermittently, without, water, already, present, in, parts, of, the, mechanism, and, which, will, not, be, filled, if, the, mechanism, starts, from, a, dry, state, a, second, problem, is, that, the, trapped, air, pockets, will, shrink, over, time, if, the, siphon, is, not, operating, due, to, no, inflow, the, air, in, pockets, is, absorbed, by, the, liquid, which, pulls, liquid, up, into, the, piping, until, the, air, pocket, disappears, and, can, cause, activation, of, water, flow, outside, the, normal, range, of, operating, when, the, storage, tank, is, not, full, leading, to, loss, of, the, liquid, seal, in, lower, parts, of, the, mechanism, a, third, problem, is, where, the, lower, end, of, the, liquid, seal, is, simply, a, u, trap, bend, in, an, outflow, pipe, during, vigorous, emptying, the, kinetic, motion, of, the, liquid, out, the, outflow, can, propel, too, much, liquid, out, causing, a, loss, of, the, sealing, volume, in, the, outflow, trap, and, loss, of, the, trapped, air, bubble, to, maintain, intermittent, operation, a, fourth, problem, involves, seep, holes, in, the, mechanism, intended, to, slowly, refill, these, various, sealing, chambers, when, the, siphon, is, dry, the, seep, holes, can, be, plugged, by, debris, and, corrosion, requiring, manual, cleaning, and, intervention, to, prevent, this, the, siphon, may, be, restricted, to, pure, liquid, sources, free, of, solids, or, precipitate, many, automatic, siphons, have, been, invented, going, back, to, at, least, the, 1850s, for, automatic, siphon, mechanisms, that, attempt, to, overcome, these, problems, using, various, pneumatic, and, hydrodynamic, principles, when, certain, liquids, needs, to, be, purified, siphoning, can, help, prevent, either, the, bottom, dregs, or, the, top, foam, and, floaties, from, being, transferred, out, of, one, container, into, a, new, container, siphoning, is, thus, useful, in, the, fermentation, of, wine, and, beer, for, this, reason, since, it, can, keep, unwanted, impurities, out, of, the, new, container, self, constructed, siphons, made, of, pipes, or, tubes, can, be, used, to, evacuate, water, from, cellars, after, floodings, between, the, flooded, cellar, and, a, deeper, place, outside, a, connection, is, built, using, a, tube, or, some, pipes, they, are, filled, with, water, through, an, intake, valve, at, the, highest, end, of, the, construction, when, the, ends, are, opened, the, water, flows, through, the, pipe, into, the, sewer, or, the, river, siphoning, is, common, in, irrigated, fields, to, transfer, a, controlled, amount, of, water, from, a, ditch, over, the, ditch, wall, into, furrows, large, siphons, may, be, used, in, municipal, waterworks, and, industry, their, size, requires, control, via, valves, at, the, intake, outlet, and, crest, of, the, siphon, the, siphon, may, be, primed, by, closing, the, intake, and, outlets, and, filling, the, siphon, at, the, crest, if, intakes, and, outlets, are, submerged, a, vacuum, pump, may, be, applied, at, the, crest, to, prime, the, siphon, alternatively, the, siphon, may, be, primed, by, a, pump, at, either, the, intake, or, outlet, gas, in, the, liquid, is, a, concern, in, large, siphons, the, gas, tends, to, accumulate, at, the, crest, and, if, enough, accumulates, to, break, the, flow, of, liquid, the, siphon, stops, working, the, siphon, itself, will, exacerbate, the, problem, because, as, the, liquid, is, raised, through, the, siphon, the, pressure, drops, causing, dissolved, gases, within, the, liquid, to, come, out, of, solution, higher, temperature, accelerates, the, release, of, gas, from, liquids, so, maintaining, a, constant, low, temperature, helps, the, longer, the, liquid, is, in, the, siphon, the, more, gas, is, released, so, a, shorter, siphon, overall, helps, local, high, points, will, trap, gas, so, the, intake, and, outlet, legs, should, have, continuous, slopes, without, intermediate, high, points, the, flow, of, the, liquid, moves, bubbles, thus, the, intake, leg, can, have, a, shallow, slope, as, the, flow, will, push, the, gas, bubbles, to, the, crest, conversely, the, outlet, leg, needs, to, have, a, steep, slope, to, allow, the, bubbles, to, move, against, the, liquid, flow, though, other, designs, call, for, a, shallow, slope, in, the, outlet, leg, as, well, to, allow, the, bubbles, to, be, carried, out, of, the, siphon, at, the, crest, the, gas, can, be, trapped, in, a, chamber, above, the, crest, the, chamber, needs, to, be, occasionally, primed, again, with, liquid, to, remove, the, gas, a, siphon, rain, gauge, is, a, rain, gauge, that, can, record, rainfall, over, an, extended, period, a, siphon, is, used, to, automatically, empty, the, gauge, it, is, often, simply, called, a, siphon, gauge, and, is, not, to, be, confused, with, a, siphon, pressure, gauge, a, siphon, drainage, method, is, being, implemented, in, several, expressways, as, of, 2022, recent, studies, found, that, it, can, reduce, groundwater, level, behind, expressway, retaining, walls, and, there, was, no, indication, of, clogging, this, new, drainage, system, is, being, pioneered, as, a, long, term, method, to, limit, leakage, hazard, in, the, retaining, wall, siphon, drainage, is, also, used, in, draining, unstable, slopes, and, siphon, roof, water, drainage, systems, have, been, in, use, since, the, 1960s, a, siphon, spillway, in, a, dam, is, usually, not, technically, a, siphon, as, it, is, generally, used, to, drain, elevated, water, levels, however, a, siphon, spillway, operates, as, an, actual, siphon, if, it, raises, the, flow, higher, than, the, surface, of, the, source, reservoir, as, sometimes, is, the, case, when, used, in, irrigation, in, operation, a, siphon, spillway, is, considered, to, be, pipe, flow, or, closed, duct, flow, a, normal, spillway, flow, is, pressurized, by, the, height, of, the, reservoir, above, the, spillway, whereas, a, siphon, flow, rate, is, governed, by, the, difference, in, height, of, the, inlet, and, outlet, some, designs, make, use, of, an, automatic, system, that, uses, the, flow, of, water, in, a, spiral, vortex, to, remove, the, air, above, to, prime, the, siphon, such, a, design, includes, the, volute, siphon, flush, toilets, often, have, some, siphon, effect, as, the, bowl, empties, some, toilets, also, use, the, siphon, principle, to, obtain, the, actual, flush, from, the, cistern, the, flush, is, triggered, by, a, lever, or, handle, that, operates, a, simple, diaphragm, like, piston, pump, that, lifts, enough, water, to, the, crest, of, the, siphon, to, start, the, flow, of, water, which, then, completely, empties, the, contents, of, the, cistern, into, the, toilet, bowl, the, advantage, of, this, system, was, that, no, water, would, leak, from, the, cistern, excepting, when, flushed, these, were, mandatory, in, the, uk, until, 2011, early, urinals, incorporated, a, siphon, in, the, cistern, which, would, flush, automatically, on, a, regular, cycle, because, there, was, a, constant, trickle, of, clean, water, being, fed, to, the, cistern, by, a, slightly, open, valve, while, if, both, ends, of, a, siphon, are, at, atmospheric, pressure, liquid, flows, from, high, to, low, if, the, bottom, end, of, a, siphon, is, pressurized, liquid, can, flow, from, low, to, high, if, pressure, is, removed, from, the, bottom, end, the, liquid, flow, will, reverse, illustrating, that, it, is, pressure, driving, the, siphon, an, everyday, illustration, of, this, is, the, siphon, coffee, brewer, which, works, as, follows, designs, vary, this, is, a, standard, design, omitting, coffee, grounds, in, practice, the, top, vessel, is, filled, with, coffee, grounds, and, the, heat, is, removed, from, the, bottom, vessel, when, the, coffee, has, finished, brewing, what, vapor, pressure, means, concretely, is, that, the, boiling, water, converts, high, density, water, a, liquid, into, low, density, steam, a, gas, which, thus, expands, to, take, up, more, volume, in, other, words, the, pressure, increases, this, pressure, from, the, expanding, steam, then, forces, the, liquid, up, the, siphon, when, the, steam, then, condenses, down, to, water, the, pressure, decreases, and, the, liquid, flows, back, down, while, a, simple, siphon, cannot, output, liquid, at, a, level, higher, than, the, source, reservoir, a, more, complicated, device, utilizing, an, airtight, metering, chamber, at, the, crest, and, a, system, of, automatic, valves, may, discharge, liquid, on, an, ongoing, basis, at, a, level, higher, than, the, source, reservoir, without, outside, pumping, energy, being, added, it, can, accomplish, this, despite, what, initially, appears, to, be, a, violation, of, conservation, of, energy, because, it, can, take, advantage, of, the, energy, of, a, large, volume, of, liquid, dropping, some, distance, to, raise, and, discharge, a, small, volume, of, liquid, above, the, source, reservoir, thus, it, might, be, said, to, require, a, large, quantity, of, falling, liquid, to, power, the, dispensing, of, a, small, quantity, such, a, system, typically, operates, in, a, cyclical, or, start, stop, but, ongoing, and, self, powered, manner, ram, pumps, do, not, work, in, this, way, these, metering, pumps, are, true, siphon, pumping, devices, which, use, siphons, as, their, power, source, an, inverted, siphon, is, not, a, siphon, but, a, term, applied, to, pipes, that, must, dip, below, an, obstruction, to, form, a, u, shaped, flow, path, large, inverted, siphons, are, used, to, convey, water, being, carried, in, canals, or, flumes, across, valleys, for, irrigation, or, gold, mining, the, romans, used, inverted, siphons, of, lead, pipes, to, cross, valleys, that, were, too, big, to, construct, an, aqueduct, inverted, siphons, are, commonly, called, traps, for, their, function, in, preventing, sewer, gases, from, coming, back, out, of, sewers, and, sometimes, making, dense, objects, like, rings, and, electronic, components, retrievable, after, falling, into, a, drain, liquid, flowing, in, one, end, simply, forces, liquid, up, and, out, the, other, end, but, solids, like, sand, will, accumulate, this, is, especially, important, in, sewerage, systems, or, culverts, which, must, be, routed, under, rivers, or, other, deep, obstructions, where, the, better, term, is, depressed, sewer, back, siphonage, is, a, plumbing, term, applied, to, the, reversal, of, normal, water, flow, in, a, plumbing, system, due, to, sharply, reduced, or, negative, pressure, on, the, water, supply, side, such, as, high, demand, on, water, supply, by, fire, fighting, it, is, not, an, actual, siphon, as, it, is, suction, back, siphonage, is, rare, as, it, depends, on, submerged, inlets, at, the, outlet, home, end, and, these, are, uncommon, back, siphonage, is, not, to, be, confused, with, backflow, which, is, the, reversed, flow, of, water, from, the, outlet, end, to, the, supply, end, caused, by, pressure, occurring, at, the, outlet, end, also, building, codes, usually, demand, a, check, valve, where, the, water, supply, enters, a, building, to, prevent, backflow, into, the, drinking, water, system, building, codes, often, contain, specific, sections, on, back, siphonage, and, especially, for, external, faucets, see, the, sample, building, code, quote, below, backflow, prevention, devices, such, as, anti, siphon, valves, are, required, in, such, designs, the, reason, is, that, external, faucets, may, be, attached, to, hoses, which, may, be, immersed, in, an, external, body, of, water, such, as, a, garden, pond, swimming, pool, aquarium, or, washing, machine, in, these, situations, the, unwanted, flow, is, not, actually, the, result, of, a, siphon, but, suction, due, to, reduced, pressure, on, the, water, supply, side, should, the, pressure, within, the, water, supply, system, fall, the, external, water, may, be, returned, by, back, pressure, into, the, drinking, water, system, through, the, faucet, another, possible, contamination, point, is, the, water, intake, in, the, toilet, tank, an, anti, siphon, valve, is, also, required, here, to, prevent, pressure, drops, in, the, water, supply, line, from, suctioning, water, out, of, the, toilet, tank, which, may, contain, additives, such, as, toilet, blue, and, contaminating, the, water, system, anti, siphon, valves, function, as, a, one, direction, check, valve, anti, siphon, valves, are, also, used, medically, hydrocephalus, or, excess, fluid, in, the, brain, may, be, treated, with, a, shunt, which, drains, cerebrospinal, fluid, from, the, brain, all, shunts, have, a, valve, to, relieve, excess, pressure, in, the, brain, the, shunt, may, lead, into, the, abdominal, cavity, such, that, the, shunt, outlet, is, significantly, lower, than, the, shunt, intake, when, the, patient, is, standing, thus, a, siphon, effect, may, take, place, and, instead, of, simply, relieving, excess, pressure, the, shunt, may, act, as, a, siphon, completely, draining, cerebrospinal, fluid, from, the, brain, the, valve, in, the, shunt, may, be, designed, to, prevent, this, siphon, action, so, that, negative, pressure, on, the, drain, of, the, shunt, does, not, result, in, excess, drainage, only, excess, positive, pressure, from, within, the, brain, should, result, in, drainage, the, anti, siphon, valve, in, medical, shunts, is, preventing, excess, forward, flow, of, liquid, in, plumbing, systems, the, anti, siphon, valve, is, preventing, backflow, sample, building, code, regulations, regarding, back, siphonage, from, the, canadian, province, of, ontario, along, with, anti, siphon, valves, anti, siphoning, devices, also, exist, the, two, are, unrelated, in, application, siphoning, can, be, used, to, remove, fuel, from, tanks, with, the, cost, of, fuel, increasing, it, has, been, linked, in, several, countries, to, the, rise, in, fuel, theft, trucks, with, their, large, fuel, tanks, are, most, vulnerable, the, anti, siphon, device, prevents, thieves, from, inserting, a, tube, into, the, fuel, tank, a, siphon, barometer, is, the, term, sometimes, applied, to, the, simplest, of, mercury, barometers, a, continuous, u, shaped, tube, of, the, same, diameter, throughout, is, sealed, on, one, end, and, filled, with, mercury, when, placed, into, the, upright, u, position, mercury, will, flow, away, from, the, sealed, end, forming, a, partial, vacuum, until, balanced, by, atmospheric, pressure, on, the, other, end, the, term, siphon, derives, from, the, belief, that, air, pressure, is, involved, in, the, operation, of, a, siphon, the, difference, in, height, of, the, fluid, between, the, two, arms, of, the, u, shaped, tube, is, the, same, as, the, maximum, intermediate, height, of, a, siphon, when, used, to, measure, pressures, other, than, atmospheric, pressure, a, siphon, barometer, is, sometimes, called, a, siphon, gauge, these, are, not, siphons, but, follow, a, standard, u, shaped, design, leading, to, the, term, siphon, barometers, are, still, produced, as, precision, instruments, siphon, barometers, should, not, be, confused, with, a, siphon, rain, gauge, a, siphon, bottle, also, called, a, soda, syphon, or, archaically, a, siphoid, is, a, pressurized, bottle, with, a, vent, and, a, valve, it, is, not, a, siphon, as, pressure, within, the, bottle, drives, the, liquid, up, and, out, a, tube, a, special, form, was, the, gasogene, a, siphon, cup, is, the, hanging, reservoir, of, paint, attached, to, a, spray, gun, it, is, not, a, siphon, as, a, vacuum, pump, extracts, the, paint, this, name, is, to, distinguish, it, from, gravity, fed, reservoirs, an, archaic, use, of, the, term, is, a, cup, of, oil, in, which, the, oil, is, transported, out, of, the, cup, via, a, cotton, wick, or, tube, to, a, surface, to, be, lubricated, this, is, not, a, siphon, but, an, example, of, capillary, action, heron, s, siphon, is, not, a, siphon, as, it, works, as, a, gravity, driven, pressure, pump, at, first, glance, it, appears, to, be, a, perpetual, motion, machine, but, will, stop, when, the, air, in, the, priming, pump, is, depleted, in, a, slightly, differently, configuration, it, is, also, known, as, heron, s, fountain, a, venturi, siphon, also, known, as, an, eductor, is, not, a, siphon, but, a, form, of, vacuum, pump, using, the, venturi, effect, of, fast, flowing, fluids, e, g, air, to, produce, low, pressures, to, suction, other, fluids, a, common, example, is, the, carburetor, see, pressure, head, the, low, pressure, at, the, throat, of, the, venturi, is, called, a, siphon, when, a, second, fluid, is, introduced, or, an, aspirator, when, the, fluid, is, air, this, is, an, example, of, the, misconception, that, air, pressure, is, the, operating, force, for, siphons, despite, the, name, siphonic, roof, drainage, does, not, work, as, a, siphon, the, technology, makes, use, of, gravity, induced, vacuum, pumping, to, carry, water, horizontally, from, multiple, roof, drains, to, a, single, downpipe, and, to, increase, flow, velocity, metal, baffles, at, the, roof, drain, inlets, reduce, the, injection, of, air, which, increases, the, efficiency, of, the, system, one, benefit, to, this, drainage, technique, is, reduced, capital, costs, in, construction, compared, to, traditional, roof, drainage, another, benefit, is, the, elimination, of, pipe, pitch, or, gradient, required, for, conventional, roof, drainage, piping, however, this, system, of, gravity, pumping, is, mainly, suitable, for, large, buildings, and, is, not, usually, suitable, for, residential, properties, the, term, self, siphon, is, used, in, a, number, of, ways, liquids, that, are, composed, of, long, polymers, can, self, siphon, and, these, liquids, do, not, depend, on, atmospheric, pressure, self, siphoning, polymer, liquids, work, the, same, as, the, siphon, chain, model, where, the, lower, part, of, the, chain, pulls, the, rest, of, the, chain, up, and, over, the, crest, this, phenomenon, is, also, called, a, tubeless, siphon, self, siphon, is, also, often, used, in, sales, literature, by, siphon, manufacturers, to, describe, portable, siphons, that, contain, a, pump, with, the, pump, no, external, suction, e, g, from, a, person, s, mouth, lungs, is, required, to, start, the, siphon, and, thus, the, product, is, described, as, a, self, siphon, if, the, upper, reservoir, is, such, that, the, liquid, there, can, rise, above, the, height, of, the, siphon, crest, the, rising, liquid, in, the, reservoir, can, self, prime, the, siphon, and, the, whole, apparatus, be, described, as, a, self, siphon, once, primed, such, a, siphon, will, continue, to, operate, until, the, level, of, the, upper, reservoir, falls, below, the, intake, of, the, siphon, such, self, priming, siphons, are, useful, in, some, rain, gauges, and, dams, the, term, siphon, is, used, for, a, number, of, structures, in, human, and, animal, anatomy, either, because, flowing, liquids, are, involved, or, because, the, structure, is, shaped, like, a, siphon, but, in, which, no, actual, siphon, effect, is, occurring, see, siphon, disambiguation, there, has, been, a, debate, if, whether, the, siphon, mechanism, plays, a, role, in, blood, circulation, however, in, the, closed, loop, of, circulation, this, was, discounted, in, contrast, in, closed, systems, like, the, circulation, gravity, does, not, hinder, uphill, flow, nor, does, it, cause, downhill, flow, because, gravity, acts, equally, on, the, ascending, and, descending, limbs, of, the, circuit, but, for, historical, reasons, the, term, is, used, one, hypothesis, in, 1989, was, that, a, siphon, existed, in, the, circulation, of, the, giraffe, but, further, research, in, 2004, found, that, there, is, no, hydrostatic, gradient, and, since, the, fall, of, fluid, does, not, assist, the, ascending, arm, there, is, no, siphon, the, giraffe, s, high, arterial, pressure, which, is, sufficient, to, raise, the, blood, 2, m, from, heart, to, head, with, sufficient, remaining, pressure, to, perfuse, the, brain, supports, this, concept, however, a, paper, written, in, 2005, urged, more, research, on, the, hypothesis, the, principle, of, the, siphon, is, not, species, specific, and, should, be, a, fundamental, principle, of, closed, circulatory, systems, therefore, the, controversy, surrounding, the, role, of, the, siphon, principle, may, best, be, resolved, by, a, comparative, approach, analyses, of, blood, pressure, on, a, variety, of, long, necked, and, long, bodied, animals, which, take, into, account, phylogenetic, relatedness, will, be, important, in, addition, experimental, studies, that, combined, measurements, of, arterial, and, venous, blood, pressures, with, cerebral, blood, flow, under, a, variety, of, gravitational, stresses, different, head, positions, will, ultimately, resolve, this, controversy, some, species, are, named, after, siphons, because, they, resemble, siphons, in, whole, or, in, part, geosiphons, are, fungi, there, are, species, of, alga, belonging, to, the, family, siphonocladaceae, in, the, phylum, chlorophyta, which, have, tube, like, structures, ruellia, villosa, is, a, tropical, plant, in, the, family, acanthaceae, that, is, also, known, by, the, botanical, synonym, siphonacanthus, villosus, nees, in, speleology, a, siphon, or, a, sump, is, that, part, of, a, cave, passage, that, lies, under, water, and, through, which, cavers, have, to, dive, to, progress, further, into, the, cave, system, but, it, is, not, an, actual, siphon, a, river, siphon, occurs, when, part, of, the, water, flow, passes, under, a, submerged, object, like, a, rock, or, tree, trunk, the, water, flowing, under, the, obstruction, can, be, very, powerful, and, as, such, can, be, very, dangerous, for, kayaking, canyoning, and, other, river, based, watersports, bernoulli, s, equation, may, be, applied, to, a, siphon, to, derive, its, ideal, flow, rate, and, theoretical, maximum, height, bernoulli, s, equation, apply, bernoulli, s, equation, to, the, surface, of, the, upper, reservoir, the, surface, is, technically, falling, as, the, upper, reservoir, is, being, drained, however, for, this, example, we, will, assume, the, reservoir, to, be, infinite, and, the, velocity, of, the, surface, may, be, set, to, zero, furthermore, the, pressure, at, both, the, surface, and, the, exit, point, c, is, atmospheric, pressure, thus, apply, bernoulli, s, equation, to, point, a, at, the, start, of, the, siphon, tube, in, the, upper, reservoir, where, p, p, a, v, v, a, and, y, d, apply, bernoulli, s, equation, to, point, b, at, the, intermediate, high, point, of, the, siphon, tube, where, p, p, b, v, v, b, and, y, h, b, apply, bernoulli, s, equation, to, point, c, where, the, siphon, empties, where, v, v, c, and, y, h, c, furthermore, the, pressure, at, the, exit, point, is, atmospheric, pressure, thus, as, the, siphon, is, a, single, system, the, constant, in, all, four, equations, is, the, same, setting, equations, 1, and, 4, equal, to, each, other, gives, solving, for, v, c, the, velocity, of, the, siphon, is, thus, driven, solely, by, the, height, difference, between, the, surface, of, the, upper, reservoir, and, the, drain, point, the, height, of, the, intermediate, high, point, h, b, does, not, affect, the, velocity, of, the, siphon, however, as, the, siphon, is, a, single, system, v, b, v, c, and, the, intermediate, high, point, does, limit, the, maximum, velocity, the, drain, point, cannot, be, lowered, indefinitely, to, increase, the, velocity, equation, 3, will, limit, the, velocity, to, retain, a, positive, pressure, at, the, intermediate, high, point, to, prevent, cavitation, the, maximum, velocity, may, be, calculated, by, combining, equations, 1, and, 3, setting, p, b, 0, and, solving, for, v, max, the, depth, d, of, the, initial, entry, point, of, the, siphon, in, the, upper, reservoir, does, not, affect, the, velocity, of, the, siphon, no, limit, to, the, depth, of, the, siphon, start, point, is, implied, by, equation, 2, as, pressure, p, a, increases, with, depth, d, both, these, facts, imply, the, operator, of, the, siphon, may, bottom, skim, or, top, skim, the, upper, reservoir, without, impacting, the, siphon, s, performance, this, equation, for, the, velocity, is, the, same, as, that, of, any, object, falling, height, h, c, this, equation, assumes, p, c, is, atmospheric, pressure, if, the, end, of, the, siphon, is, below, the, surface, the, height, to, the, end, of, the, siphon, cannot, be, used, rather, the, height, difference, between, the, reservoirs, should, be, used, although, siphons, can, exceed, the, barometric, height, of, the, liquid, in, special, circumstances, e, g, when, the, liquid, is, degassed, and, the, tube, is, clean, and, smooth, in, general, the, practical, maximum, height, can, be, found, as, follows, setting, equations, 1, and, 3, equal, to, each, other, gives, maximum, height, of, the, intermediate, high, point, occurs, when, it, is, so, high, that, the, pressure, at, the, intermediate, high, point, is, zero, in, typical, scenarios, this, will, cause, the, liquid, to, form, bubbles, and, if, the, bubbles, enlarge, to, fill, the, pipe, then, the, siphon, will, break, setting, p, b, 0, solving, for, h, b, this, means, that, the, height, of, the, intermediate, high, point, is, limited, by, pressure, along, the, streamline, being, always, greater, than, zero, this, is, the, maximum, height, that, a, siphon, will, work, substituting, values, will, give, approximately, 10, m, 33, feet, for, water, and, by, definition, of, standard, pressure, 0, 76, m, 760, mm, 30, in, for, mercury, the, ratio, of, heights, about, 13, 6, equals, the, ratio, of, densities, of, water, and, mercury, at, a, given, temperature, as, long, as, this, condition, is, satisfied, pressure, greater, than, zero, the, flow, at, the, output, of, the, siphon, is, still, only, governed, by, the, height, difference, between, the, source, surface, and, the, outlet, volume, of, fluid, in, the, apparatus, is, not, relevant, as, long, as, the, pressure, head, remains, above, zero, in, every, section, because, pressure, drops, when, velocity, is, increased, a, static, siphon, or, manometer, can, have, a, slightly, higher, height, than, a, flowing, siphon, experiments, have, shown, that, siphons, can, operate, in, a, vacuum, via, cohesion, and, tensile, strength, between, molecules, provided, that, the, liquids, are, pure, and, degassed, and, surfaces, are, very, clean, the, oxford, english, dictionary, oed, entry, on, siphon, published, in, 1911, states, that, a, siphon, works, by, atmospheric, pressure, stephen, hughes, of, queensland, university, of, technology, criticized, this, in, a, 2010, article, which, was, widely, reported, in, the, media, the, oed, editors, stated, there, is, continuing, debate, among, scientists, as, to, which, view, is, correct, we, would, expect, to, reflect, this, debate, in, the, fully, updated, entry, for, siphon, due, to, be, published, later, this, year, hughes, continued, to, defend, his, view, of, the, siphon, in, a, late, september, post, at, the, oxford, blog, the, 2015, definition, by, the, oed, is, a, tube, used, to, convey, liquid, upwards, from, a, reservoir, and, then, down, to, a, lower, level, of, its, own, accord, once, the, liquid, has, been, forced, into, the, tube, typically, by,

bent, to, form, two, legs, of, unequal, length, for, conveying, liquid, over, the, edge, of, a, vessel, and, delivering, it, at, a, lower, level, siphons, may, be, of, any, size, the, action, depends, upon, the, influence, of, gravity, not, as, sometimes, thought, on, the, difference, in, atmospheric, pressure, a, siphon, will, work, in, a, vacuum, and, upon, the, cohesive, forces, that, prevent, the, columns, of, liquid, in, the, legs, of, the, siphon, from, breaking, under, their, own, weight, at, sea, level, water, can, be, lifted, a, little, more, than, 10, metres, 33, feet, by, a, siphon,
