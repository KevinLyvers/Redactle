natural, gas, also, called, fossil, gas, methane, gas, or, simply, gas, is, a, naturally, occurring, mixture, of, gaseous, hydrocarbons, consisting, primarily, of, methane, 95, in, addition, to, various, smaller, amounts, of, other, higher, alkanes, traces, of, carbon, dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfide, and, helium, are, also, usually, present, methane, is, colorless, and, odorless, and, the, second, largest, greenhouse, gas, contributor, to, global, climate, change, after, carbon, dioxide, because, natural, gas, is, odorless, odorizers, such, as, mercaptan, which, smells, like, sulfur, or, rotten, eggs, are, commonly, added, to, it, for, safety, so, that, leaks, can, be, readily, detected, natural, gas, is, a, fossil, fuel, that, is, formed, when, layers, of, organic, matter, primarily, marine, microorganisms, decompose, under, anaerobic, conditions, and, are, subjected, to, intense, heat, and, pressure, underground, over, millions, of, years, the, energy, that, the, decayed, organisms, originally, obtained, from, the, sun, via, photosynthesis, is, stored, as, chemical, energy, within, the, molecules, of, methane, and, other, hydrocarbons, natural, gas, can, be, burned, for, heating, cooking, and, electricity, generation, it, is, also, used, as, a, chemical, feedstock, in, the, manufacture, of, plastics, and, other, commercially, important, organic, chemicals, and, less, commonly, used, as, a, fuel, for, vehicles, the, extraction, and, consumption, of, natural, gas, is, a, major, and, growing, contributor, to, climate, change, both, the, gas, itself, specifically, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, which, is, released, when, natural, gas, is, burned, are, greenhouse, gases, when, burned, for, heat, or, electricity, natural, gas, emits, fewer, toxic, air, pollutants, less, carbon, dioxide, and, almost, no, particulate, matter, compared, to, other, fossil, and, biomass, fuels, however, gas, venting, and, unintended, fugitive, emissions, throughout, the, supply, chain, can, result, in, natural, gas, having, a, similar, carbon, footprint, to, other, fossil, fuels, overall, natural, gas, can, be, found, in, underground, geological, formations, often, alongside, other, fossil, fuels, like, coal, and, oil, petroleum, most, natural, gas, has, been, created, through, either, biogenic, or, thermogenic, processes, thermogenic, gas, takes, a, much, longer, period, of, time, to, form, and, is, created, when, organic, matter, is, heated, and, compressed, deep, underground, methanogenic, organisms, produce, methane, from, a, variety, of, sources, principally, carbon, dioxide, during, petroleum, production, natural, gas, is, sometimes, flared, rather, than, being, collected, and, used, before, natural, gas, can, be, burned, as, a, fuel, or, used, in, manufacturing, processes, it, almost, always, has, to, be, processed, to, remove, impurities, such, as, water, the, byproducts, of, this, processing, include, ethane, propane, butanes, pentanes, and, higher, molecular, weight, hydrocarbons, hydrogen, sulfide, which, may, be, converted, into, pure, sulfur, carbon, dioxide, water, vapor, and, sometimes, helium, and, nitrogen, must, also, be, removed, natural, gas, is, sometimes, informally, referred, to, simply, as, gas, especially, when, it, is, being, compared, to, other, energy, sources, such, as, oil, coal, or, renewables, however, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, gasoline, which, is, also, shortened, in, colloquial, usage, to, gas, especially, in, north, america, natural, gas, is, measured, in, standard, cubic, meters, or, standard, cubic, feet, the, density, compared, to, air, ranges, from, 0, 58, 16, 8, g, mole, 0, 71, kg, per, standard, cubic, meter, to, as, high, as, 0, 79, 22, 9, g, mole, 0, 97, kg, per, scm, but, generally, less, than, 0, 64, 18, 5, g, mole, 0, 78, kg, per, scm, for, comparison, pure, methane, 16, 0425, g, mole, has, a, density, 0, 5539, times, that, of, air, 0, 678, kg, per, standard, cubic, meter, in, the, early, 1800s, natural, gas, became, known, as, natural, to, distinguish, it, from, the, dominant, gas, fuel, at, the, time, coal, gas, unlike, coal, gas, which, is, manufactured, by, heating, coal, natural, gas, can, be, extracted, from, the, ground, in, its, native, gaseous, form, when, the, use, of, natural, gas, overtook, the, use, of, coal, gas, in, english, speaking, countries, in, the, 20th, century, it, was, increasingly, referred, to, as, simply, gas, in, order, to, highlight, its, role, in, exacerbating, the, climate, crisis, however, many, organizations, have, criticized, the, continued, use, of, the, word, natural, in, referring, to, the, gas, these, advocates, prefer, the, term, fossil, gas, or, methane, gas, as, better, conveying, to, the, public, its, climate, threat, a, 2020, study, of, americans, perceptions, of, the, fuel, found, that, across, political, identifications, the, term, methane, gas, led, to, better, estimates, of, its, harms, and, risks, natural, gas, can, come, out, of, the, ground, and, cause, a, long, burning, fire, in, ancient, greece, the, gas, flames, at, mount, chimaera, contributed, to, the, legend, of, the, fire, breathing, creature, chimera, in, ancient, china, gas, resulting, from, the, drilling, for, brines, was, first, used, by, about, 400, bc, the, chinese, transported, gas, seeping, from, the, ground, in, crude, pipelines, of, bamboo, to, where, it, was, used, to, boil, salt, water, to, extract, the, salt, in, the, ziliujing, district, of, sichuan, natural, gas, was, not, widely, used, before, the, development, of, long, distance, pipelines, in, the, early, twentieth, century, before, that, most, use, was, near, to, the, source, of, the, well, and, the, predominant, gas, for, fuel, and, lighting, during, the, industrial, revolution, was, manufactured, coal, gas, the, history, of, natural, gas, in, the, united, states, begins, with, localized, use, in, the, seventeenth, century, french, missionaries, witnessed, the, american, indians, setting, fire, to, natural, gas, seeps, around, lake, erie, and, scattered, observations, of, these, seeps, were, made, by, european, descended, settlers, throughout, the, eastern, seaboard, through, the, 1700s, in, 1821, william, hart, dug, the, first, commercial, natural, gas, well, in, the, united, states, at, fredonia, new, york, united, states, which, led, in, 1858, to, the, formation, of, the, fredonia, gas, light, company, further, such, ventures, followed, near, wells, in, other, states, until, technological, innovations, allowed, the, growth, of, major, long, distance, pipelines, from, the, 1920s, onward, by, 2009, 66, 000, km, 3, 16, 000, cu, mi, or, 8, had, been, used, out, of, the, total, 850, 000, km, 3, 200, 000, cu, mi, of, estimated, remaining, recoverable, reserves, of, natural, gas, in, the, 19th, century, natural, gas, was, primarily, obtained, as, a, by, product, of, producing, oil, the, small, light, gas, carbon, chains, came, out, of, solution, as, the, extracted, fluids, underwent, pressure, reduction, from, the, reservoir, to, the, surface, similar, to, uncapping, a, soft, drink, bottle, where, the, carbon, dioxide, effervesces, the, gas, was, often, viewed, as, a, by, product, a, hazard, and, a, disposal, problem, in, active, oil, fields, the, large, volumes, produced, could, not, be, used, until, relatively, expensive, pipeline, and, storage, facilities, were, constructed, to, deliver, the, gas, to, consumer, markets, until, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, most, natural, gas, associated, with, oil, was, either, simply, released, or, burned, off, at, oil, fields, gas, venting, and, production, flaring, are, still, practised, in, modern, times, but, efforts, are, ongoing, around, the, world, to, retire, them, and, to, replace, them, with, other, commercially, viable, and, useful, alternatives, in, addition, to, transporting, gas, via, pipelines, for, use, in, power, generation, other, end, uses, for, natural, gas, include, export, as, liquefied, natural, gas, lng, or, conversion, of, natural, gas, into, other, liquid, products, via, gas, to, liquids, gtl, technologies, gtl, technologies, can, convert, natural, gas, into, liquids, products, such, as, gasoline, diesel, or, jet, fuel, a, variety, of, gtl, technologies, have, been, developed, including, fischer, tropsch, f, t, methanol, to, gasoline, mtg, and, syngas, to, gasoline, plus, stg, f, t, produces, a, synthetic, crude, that, can, be, further, refined, into, finished, products, while, mtg, can, produce, synthetic, gasoline, from, natural, gas, stg, can, produce, drop, in, gasoline, diesel, jet, fuel, and, aromatic, chemicals, directly, from, natural, gas, via, a, single, loop, process, in, 2011, royal, dutch, shell, s, 140, 000, barrels, 22, 000, m, 3, per, day, f, t, plant, went, into, operation, in, qatar, natural, gas, can, be, associated, found, in, oil, fields, or, non, associated, isolated, in, natural, gas, fields, and, is, also, found, in, coal, beds, as, coalbed, methane, it, sometimes, contains, a, significant, amount, of, ethane, propane, butane, and, pentane, heavier, hydrocarbons, removed, for, commercial, use, prior, to, the, methane, being, sold, as, a, consumer, fuel, or, chemical, plant, feedstock, non, hydrocarbons, such, as, carbon, dioxide, nitrogen, helium, rarely, and, hydrogen, sulfide, must, also, be, removed, before, the, natural, gas, can, be, transported, natural, gas, extracted, from, oil, wells, is, called, casinghead, gas, whether, or, not, truly, produced, up, the, annulus, and, through, a, casinghead, outlet, or, associated, gas, the, natural, gas, industry, is, extracting, an, increasing, quantity, of, gas, from, challenging, unconventional, resource, types, sour, gas, tight, gas, shale, gas, and, coalbed, methane, there, is, some, disagreement, on, which, country, has, the, largest, proven, gas, reserves, sources, that, consider, that, russia, has, by, far, the, largest, proven, reserves, include, the, us, central, intelligence, agency, 47, 600, km, 3, and, energy, information, administration, 47, 800, km, 3, as, well, as, the, organization, of, petroleum, exporting, countries, 48, 700, km, 3, contrarily, bp, credits, russia, with, only, 32, 900, km, 3, which, would, place, it, in, second, slightly, behind, iran, 33, 100, to, 33, 800, km, 3, depending, on, the, source, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, about, 900, 000, km, 3, of, unconventional, gas, such, as, shale, gas, of, which, 180, 000, km, 3, may, be, recoverable, in, turn, many, studies, from, mit, black, veatch, and, the, us, department, of, energy, predict, that, natural, gas, will, account, for, a, larger, portion, of, electricity, generation, and, heat, in, the, future, the, world, s, largest, gas, field, is, the, offshore, south, pars, north, dome, gas, condensate, field, shared, between, iran, and, qatar, it, is, estimated, to, have, 51, 000, cubic, kilometers, 12, 000, cu, mi, of, natural, gas, and, 50, billion, barrels, 7, 9, billion, cubic, meters, of, natural, gas, condensates, because, natural, gas, is, not, a, pure, product, as, the, reservoir, pressure, drops, when, non, associated, gas, is, extracted, from, a, field, under, supercritical, pressure, temperature, conditions, the, higher, molecular, weight, components, may, partially, condense, upon, isothermic, depressurizing, an, effect, called, retrograde, condensation, the, liquid, thus, formed, may, get, trapped, as, the, pores, of, the, gas, reservoir, get, depleted, one, method, to, deal, with, this, problem, is, to, re, inject, dried, gas, free, of, condensate, to, maintain, the, underground, pressure, and, to, allow, re, evaporation, and, extraction, of, condensates, more, frequently, the, liquid, condenses, at, the, surface, and, one, of, the, tasks, of, the, gas, plant, is, to, collect, this, condensate, the, resulting, liquid, is, called, natural, gas, liquid, ngl, and, has, commercial, value, shale, gas, is, natural, gas, produced, from, shale, because, shale, s, matrix, permeability, is, too, low, to, allow, gas, to, flow, in, economical, quantities, shale, gas, wells, depend, on, fractures, to, allow, the, gas, to, flow, early, shale, gas, wells, depended, on, natural, fractures, through, which, gas, flowed, almost, all, shale, gas, wells, today, require, fractures, artificially, created, by, hydraulic, fracturing, since, 2000, shale, gas, has, become, a, major, source, of, natural, gas, in, the, united, states, and, canada, because, of, increased, shale, gas, production, the, united, states, was, in, 2014, the, number, one, natural, gas, producer, in, the, world, the, production, of, shale, gas, in, the, united, states, has, been, described, as, a, shale, gas, revolution, and, as, one, of, the, landmark, events, in, the, 21st, century, following, the, increased, production, in, the, united, states, shale, gas, exploration, is, beginning, in, countries, such, as, poland, china, and, south, africa, chinese, geologists, have, identified, the, sichuan, basin, as, a, promising, target, for, shale, gas, drilling, because, of, the, similarity, of, shales, to, those, that, have, proven, productive, in, the, united, states, production, from, the, wei, 201, well, is, between, 10, 000, and, 20, 000, m, 3, per, day, in, late, 2020, china, national, petroleum, corporation, claimed, daily, production, of, 20, million, cubic, meters, of, gas, from, its, changning, weiyuan, demonstration, zone, town, gas, is, a, flammable, gaseous, fuel, made, by, the, destructive, distillation, of, coal, it, contains, a, variety, of, calorific, gases, including, hydrogen, carbon, monoxide, methane, and, other, volatile, hydrocarbons, together, with, small, quantities, of, non, calorific, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, and, nitrogen, and, was, used, in, a, similar, way, to, natural, gas, this, is, a, historical, technology, and, is, not, usually, economically, competitive, with, other, sources, of, fuel, gas, today, most, town, gashouses, located, in, the, eastern, us, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, were, simple, by, product, coke, ovens, that, heated, bituminous, coal, in, air, tight, chambers, the, gas, driven, off, from, the, coal, was, collected, and, distributed, through, networks, of, pipes, to, residences, and, other, buildings, where, it, was, used, for, cooking, and, lighting, gas, heating, did, not, come, into, widespread, use, until, the, last, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, coal, tar, or, asphalt, that, collected, in, the, bottoms, of, the, gashouse, ovens, was, often, used, for, roofing, and, other, waterproofing, purposes, and, when, mixed, with, sand, and, gravel, was, used, for, paving, streets, huge, quantities, of, natural, gas, primarily, methane, exist, in, the, form, of, clathrates, under, sediment, on, offshore, continental, shelves, and, on, land, in, arctic, regions, that, experience, permafrost, such, as, those, in, siberia, hydrates, require, a, combination, of, high, pressure, and, low, temperature, to, form, in, 2013, japan, oil, gas, and, metals, national, corporation, jogmec, announced, that, they, had, recovered, commercially, relevant, quantities, of, natural, gas, from, methane, hydrate, the, image, below, is, a, schematic, block, flow, diagram, of, a, typical, natural, gas, processing, plant, it, shows, the, various, unit, processes, used, to, convert, raw, natural, gas, into, sales, gas, pipelined, to, the, end, user, markets, the, block, flow, diagram, also, shows, how, processing, of, the, raw, natural, gas, yields, byproduct, sulfur, byproduct, ethane, and, natural, gas, liquids, ngl, propane, butanes, and, natural, gasoline, denoted, as, pentanes, as, of, mid, 2020, natural, gas, production, in, the, us, had, peaked, three, times, with, current, levels, exceeding, both, previous, peaks, it, reached, 24, 1, trillion, cubic, feet, per, year, in, 1973, followed, by, a, decline, and, reached, 24, 5, trillion, cubic, feet, in, 2001, after, a, brief, drop, withdrawals, increased, nearly, every, year, since, 2006, owing, to, the, shale, gas, boom, with, 2017, production, at, 33, 4, trillion, cubic, feet, and, 2019, production, at, 40, 7, trillion, cubic, feet, after, the, third, peak, in, december, 2019, extraction, continued, to, fall, from, march, onward, due, to, decreased, demand, caused, by, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, the, us, the, 2021, global, energy, crisis, was, driven, by, a, global, surge, in, demand, as, the, world, quit, the, economic, recession, caused, by, covid, 19, particularly, due, to, strong, energy, demand, in, asia, because, of, its, low, density, it, is, not, easy, to, store, natural, gas, or, to, transport, it, by, vehicle, natural, gas, pipelines, are, impractical, across, oceans, since, the, gas, needs, to, be, cooled, down, and, compressed, as, the, friction, in, the, pipeline, causes, the, gas, to, heat, up, many, existing, pipelines, in, the, us, are, close, to, reaching, their, capacity, prompting, some, politicians, representing, northern, states, to, speak, of, potential, shortages, the, large, trade, cost, implies, that, natural, gas, markets, are, globally, much, less, integrated, causing, significant, price, differences, across, countries, in, western, europe, the, gas, pipeline, network, is, already, dense, new, pipelines, are, planned, or, under, construction, between, western, europe, and, the, near, east, or, northern, africa, whenever, gas, is, bought, or, sold, at, custody, transfer, points, rules, and, agreements, are, made, regarding, the, gas, quality, these, may, include, the, maximum, allowable, concentration, of, co, 2, h, 2, s, and, h, 2, o, usually, sales, quality, gas, that, has, been, treated, to, remove, contamination, is, traded, on, a, dry, gas, basis, and, is, required, to, be, commercially, free, from, objectionable, odours, materials, and, dust, or, other, solid, or, liquid, matter, waxes, gums, and, gum, forming, constituents, which, might, damage, or, adversely, affect, operation, of, equipment, downstream, of, the, custody, transfer, point, lng, carrier, ships, transport, liquefied, natural, gas, lng, across, oceans, while, tank, trucks, can, carry, lng, or, compressed, natural, gas, cng, over, shorter, distances, sea, transport, using, cng, carrier, ships, that, are, now, under, development, may, be, competitive, with, lng, transport, in, specific, conditions, gas, is, turned, into, liquid, at, a, liquefaction, plant, and, is, returned, to, gas, form, at, regasification, plant, at, the, terminal, shipborne, regasification, equipment, is, also, used, lng, is, the, preferred, form, for, long, distance, high, volume, transportation, of, natural, gas, whereas, pipeline, is, preferred, for, transport, for, distances, up, to, 4, 000, km, 2, 500, mi, over, land, and, approximately, half, that, distance, offshore, cng, is, transported, at, high, pressure, typically, above, 200, bars, 20, 000, kpa, 2, 900, psi, compressors, and, decompression, equipment, are, less, capital, intensive, and, may, be, economical, in, smaller, unit, sizes, than, liquefaction, regasification, plants, natural, gas, trucks, and, carriers, may, transport, natural, gas, directly, to, end, users, or, to, distribution, points, such, as, pipelines, in, the, past, the, natural, gas, which, was, recovered, in, the, course, of, recovering, petroleum, could, not, be, profitably, sold, and, was, simply, burned, at, the, oil, field, in, a, process, known, as, flaring, flaring, is, now, illegal, in, many, countries, additionally, higher, demand, in, the, last, 20, 30, years, has, made, production, of, gas, associated, with, oil, economically, viable, as, a, further, option, the, gas, is, now, sometimes, re, injected, into, the, formation, for, enhanced, oil, recovery, by, pressure, maintenance, as, well, as, miscible, or, immiscible, flooding, conservation, re, injection, or, flaring, of, natural, gas, associated, with, oil, is, primarily, dependent, on, proximity, to, markets, pipelines, and, regulatory, restrictions, natural, gas, can, be, indirectly, exported, through, the, absorption, in, other, physical, output, the, expansion, of, shale, gas, production, in, the, us, has, caused, prices, to, drop, relative, to, other, countries, this, has, caused, a, boom, in, energy, intensive, manufacturing, sector, exports, whereby, the, average, dollar, unit, of, us, manufacturing, exports, has, almost, tripled, its, energy, content, between, 1996, and, 2012, a, master, gas, system, was, invented, in, saudi, arabia, in, the, late, 1970s, ending, any, necessity, for, flaring, satellite, and, nearby, infra, red, camera, observations, however, shows, that, flaring, and, venting, are, still, happening, in, some, countries, natural, gas, is, used, to, generate, electricity, and, heat, for, desalination, similarly, some, landfills, that, also, discharge, methane, gases, have, been, set, up, to, capture, the, methane, and, generate, electricity, natural, gas, is, often, stored, underground, inside, depleted, gas, reservoirs, from, previous, gas, wells, salt, domes, or, in, tanks, as, liquefied, natural, gas, the, gas, is, injected, in, a, time, of, low, demand, and, extracted, when, demand, picks, up, storage, nearby, end, users, helps, to, meet, volatile, demands, but, such, storage, may, not, always, be, practicable, with, 15, countries, accounting, for, 84, of, the, worldwide, extraction, access, to, natural, gas, has, become, an, important, issue, in, international, politics, and, countries, vie, for, control, of, pipelines, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, gazprom, the, state, owned, energy, company, in, russia, engaged, in, disputes, with, ukraine, and, belarus, over, the, price, of, natural, gas, which, have, created, concerns, that, gas, deliveries, to, parts, of, europe, could, be, cut, off, for, political, reasons, the, united, states, is, preparing, to, export, natural, gas, floating, liquefied, natural, gas, flng, is, an, innovative, technology, designed, to, enable, the, development, of, offshore, gas, resources, that, would, otherwise, remain, untapped, due, to, environmental, or, economic, factors, which, currently, make, them, impractical, to, develop, via, a, land, based, lng, operation, flng, technology, also, provides, a, number, of, environmental, and, economic, advantages, many, gas, and, oil, companies, are, considering, the, economic, and, environmental, benefits, of, floating, liquefied, natural, gas, flng, there, are, currently, projects, underway, to, construct, five, flng, facilities, petronas, is, close, to, completion, on, their, flng, 1, at, daewoo, shipbuilding, and, marine, engineering, and, are, underway, on, their, flng, 2, project, at, samsung, heavy, industries, shell, prelude, is, due, to, start, production, 2017, the, browse, lng, project, will, commence, feed, in, 2019, natural, gas, is, primarily, used, in, the, northern, hemisphere, north, america, and, europe, are, major, consumers, often, well, head, gases, require, removal, of, various, hydrocarbon, molecules, contained, within, the, gas, some, of, these, gases, include, heptane, pentane, propane, and, other, hydrocarbons, with, molecular, weights, above, methane, ch, 4, the, natural, gas, transmission, lines, extend, to, the, natural, gas, processing, plant, or, unit, which, removes, the, higher, molecular, weight, hydrocarbons, to, produce, natural, gas, with, energy, content, between, 35, 39, megajoules, per, cubic, metre, 950, 1, 050, british, thermal, units, per, cubic, foot, the, processed, natural, gas, may, then, be, used, for, residential, commercial, and, industrial, uses, natural, gas, flowing, in, the, distribution, lines, is, called, mid, stream, natural, gas, and, is, often, used, to, power, engines, which, rotate, compressors, these, compressors, are, required, in, the, transmission, line, to, pressurize, and, repressurize, the, mid, stream, natural, gas, as, the, gas, travels, typically, natural, gas, powered, engines, require, 35, 39, mj, m, 3, 950, 1, 050, btu, cu, ft, natural, gas, to, operate, at, the, rotational, name, plate, specifications, several, methods, are, used, to, remove, these, higher, molecular, weighted, gases, for, use, by, the, natural, gas, engine, a, few, technologies, are, as, follows, in, the, us, over, one, third, of, households, 40, million, homes, cook, with, gas, natural, gas, dispensed, in, a, residential, setting, can, generate, temperatures, in, excess, of, 1, 100, c, 2, 000, f, making, it, a, powerful, domestic, cooking, and, heating, fuel, stanford, scientists, estimated, that, gas, stoves, emit, 0, 8, 1, 3, of, the, gas, they, use, as, unburned, methane, and, that, total, u, s, stove, emissions, are, 28, 1, gigagrams, of, methane, in, much, of, the, developed, world, it, is, supplied, through, pipes, to, homes, where, it, is, used, for, many, purposes, including, ranges, and, ovens, heating, cooling, outdoor, and, portable, grills, and, central, heating, heaters, in, homes, and, other, buildings, may, include, boilers, furnaces, and, water, heaters, both, north, america, and, europe, are, major,

in, pressure, in, the, reservoir, such, decrease, in, pressure, in, turn, may, result, in, subsidence, sinking, of, the, ground, above, subsidence, may, affect, ecosystems, waterways, sewer, and, water, supply, systems, foundations, and, so, on, releasing, natural, gas, from, subsurface, porous, rock, formations, may, be, accomplished, by, a, process, called, hydraulic, fracturing, or, fracking, since, the, first, commercial, hydraulic, fracturing, operation, in, 1949, approximately, one, million, wells, have, been, hydraulically, fractured, in, the, united, states, the, production, of, natural, gas, from, hydraulically, fractured, wells, has, used, the, technological, developments, of, directional, and, horizontal, drilling, which, improved, access, to, natural, gas, in, tight, rock, formations, strong, growth, in, the, production, of, unconventional, gas, from, hydraulically, fractured, wells, occurred, between, 2000, and, 2012, in, hydraulic, fracturing, well, operators,

rock, formation, sand, and, other, particles, are, added, to, the, water, as, a, proppant, to, keep, the, fractures, in, the, rock, open, thus, enabling, the, gas, to, flow, into, the, casing, and, then, to, the, surface, chemicals, are, added, to, the, fluid, to, perform, such, functions, as, reducing, friction, and, inhibiting, corrosion, after, the, frack, oil, or, gas, is, extracted, and, 30, 70, of, the, frack, fluid, i, e, the, mixture, of, water, chemicals, sand, etc, flows, back, to, the, surface, many, gas, bearing, formations, also, contain, water, which, will, flow, up, the, wellbore, to, the, surface, along, with, the, gas, in, both, hydraulically, fractured, and, non, hydraulically, fractured, wells, this, produced, water, often, has, a, high, content, of, salt, and, other, dissolved, minerals, that, occur, in, the, formation, the, volume, of, water, used, to, hydraulically, fracture, wells, varies, according, to, the, hydraulic, fracturing, technique, in, the, united, states, the, average, volume, of, water, used, per, hydraulic, fracture, has, been, reported, as, nearly, 7, 375, gallons, for, vertical, oil, and, gas, wells, prior, to, 1953, nearly, 197, 000, gallons, for, vertical, oil, and, gas, wells, between, 2000, and, 2010, and, nearly, 3, million, gallons, for, horizontal, gas, wells, between, 2000, and, 2010, determining, which, fracking, technique, is, appropriate, for, well, productivity, depends, largely, on, the, properties, of, the, reservoir, rock, from, which, to, extract, oil, or, gas, if, the, rock, is, characterized, by, low, permeability, which, refers, to, its, ability, to, let, substances, i, e, gas, pass, through, it, then, the, rock, may, be, considered, a, source, of, tight, gas, fracking, for, shale, gas, which, is, currently, also, known, as, a, source, of, unconventional, gas, involves, drilling, a, borehole, vertically, until, it, reaches, a, lateral, shale, rock, formation, at, which, point, the, drill, turns, to, follow, the, rock, for, hundreds, or, thousands, of, feet, horizontally, in, contrast, conventional, oil, and, gas, sources, are, characterized, by, higher, rock, permeability, which, naturally, enables, the, flow, of, oil, or, gas, into, the, wellbore, with, less, intensive, hydraulic, fracturing, techniques, than, the, production, of, tight, gas, has, required, the, decades, in, development, of, drilling, technology, for, conventional, and, unconventional, oil, and, gas, production, have, not, only, improved, access, to, natural, gas, in, low, permeability, reservoir, rocks, but, also, posed, significant, adverse, impacts, on, environmental, and, public, health, the, us, epa, has, acknowledged, that, toxic, carcinogenic, chemicals, i, e, benzene, and, ethylbenzene, have, been, used, as, gelling, agents, in, water, and, chemical, mixtures, for, high, volume, horizontal, fracturing, hvhf, following, the, hydraulic, fracture, in, hvhf, the, water, chemicals, and, frack,

in, shale, rock, formations, fracking, chemicals, radioactive, materials, heavy, metals, and, salts, that, are, removed, from, the, hvhf, well, by, well, operators, are, so, difficult, to, remove, from, the, water, they, are, mixed, with, and, would, so, heavily, pollute, the, water, cycle, that, most, of, the, flowback, is, either, recycled, into, other, fracking, operations, or, injected, into, deep, underground, wells, eliminating, the, water, that, hvhf, required, from, the, hydrologic, cycle, historically, low, gas, prices, have, delayed, the, nuclear, renaissance, as, well, as,
