a, telephone, colloquially, referred, to, as, a, phone, is, a, telecommunications, device, that, permits, two, or, more, users, to, conduct, a, conversation, when, they, are, too, far, apart, to, be, easily, heard, directly, a, telephone, converts, sound, typically, and, most, efficiently, the, human, voice, into, electronic, signals, that, are, transmitted, via, cables, and, other, communication, channels, to, another, telephone, which, reproduces, the, sound, to, the, receiving, user, the, term, is, derived, from, ancient, greek, romanized, t, le, lit, far, and, ph, n, voice, together, meaning, distant, voice, in, 1876, alexander, graham, bell, was, the, first, to, be, granted, a, united, states, patent, for, a, device, that, produced, clearly, intelligible, replication, of, the, human, voice, at, a, second, device, this, instrument, was, further, developed, by, many, others, and, became, rapidly, indispensable, in, business, government, and, in, households, the, essential, elements, of, a, telephone, are, a, microphone, transmitter, to, speak, into, and, an, earphone, receiver, which, reproduces, the, voice, at, a, distant, location, the, receiver, and, transmitter, are, usually, built, into, a, handset, which, is, held, up, to, the, ear, and, mouth, during, conversation, the, transmitter, converts, the, sound, waves, to, electrical, signals, which, are, sent, through, the, telecommunications, system, to, the, receiving, telephone, which, converts, the, signals, into, audible, sound, in, the, receiver, or, sometimes, a, loudspeaker, telephones, permit, transmission, in, both, directions, simultaneously, most, telephones, also, contain, an, alerting, feature, such, as, a, ringer, or, a, visual, indicator, to, announce, an, incoming, telephone, call, telephone, calls, are, initiated, most, commonly, with, a, keypad, or, dial, affixed, to, the, telephone, to, enter, a, telephone, number, which, is, the, address, of, the, call, recipient, s, telephone, in, the, telecommunications, system, but, other, methods, existed, in, the, early, history, of, the, telephone, the, first, telephones, were, directly, connected, to, each, other, from, one, customer, s, office, or, residence, to, another, customer, s, location, being, impractical, beyond, just, a, few, customers, these, systems, were, quickly, replaced, by, manually, operated, centrally, located, switchboards, these, exchanges, were, soon, connected, together, eventually, forming, an, automated, worldwide, public, switched, telephone, network, for, greater, mobility, various, radio, systems, were, developed, in, the, mid, 20th, century, for, transmission, between, mobile, stations, on, ships, and, in, automobiles, hand, held, mobile, phones, were, introduced, for, personal, service, starting, in, 1973, in, later, decades, the, analog, cellular, system, evolved, into, digital, networks, with, greater, capability, and, lower, cost, convergence, in, communication, services, has, provided, a, broad, spectrum, of, capabilities, in, cell, phones, including, mobile, computing, giving, rise, to, the, smartphone, the, dominant, type, of, telephone, in, the, world, today, before, the, development, of, the, electric, telephone, the, term, telephone, was, applied, to, other, inventions, and, not, all, early, researchers, of, the, electrical, device, used, the, term, perhaps, the, earliest, use, of, the, word, for, a, communications, system, was, the, telephon, created, by, gottfried, huth, in, 1796, huth, proposed, an, alternative, to, the, optical, telegraph, of, claude, chappe, in, which, the, operators, in, the, signaling, towers, would, shout, to, each, other, by, means, of, what, he, called, speaking, tubes, but, would, now, be, called, giant, megaphones, a, communication, device, for, sailing, vessels, called, telephone, was, invented, by, captain, john, taylor, in, 1844, this, instrument, used, four, air, horns, to, communicate, with, vessels, in, foggy, weather, johann, philipp, reis, used, the, term, in, reference, to, his, invention, commonly, known, as, the, reis, telephone, in, c, 1860, his, device, appears, to, be, the, first, device, based, on, the, conversion, of, sound, into, electrical, impulses, the, term, telephone, was, adopted, into, the, vocabulary, of, many, languages, it, is, derived, from, the, greek, t, le, far, and, ph, n, voice, together, meaning, distant, voice, credit, for, the, invention, of, the, electric, telephone, is, frequently, disputed, as, with, other, influential, inventions, such, as, radio, television, the, light, bulb, and, the, computer, several, inventors, pioneered, experimental, work, on, voice, transmission, over, a, wire, and, improved, on, each, other, s, ideas, new, controversies, over, the, issue, still, arise, from, time, to, time, charles, bourseul, antonio, meucci, johann, philipp, reis, alexander, graham, bell, and, elisha, gray, amongst, others, have, all, been, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, telephone, alexander, graham, bell, was, the, first, to, be, awarded, a, patent, for, the, electric, telephone, by, the, united, states, patent, and, trademark, office, uspto, in, march, 1876, before, bell, s, patent, the, telephone, transmitted, sound, in, a, way, that, was, similar, to, the, telegraph, this, method, used, vibrations, and, circuits, to, send, electrical, pulses, but, was, missing, key, features, bell, found, that, this, method, produced, a, sound, through, intermittent, currents, but, in, order, for, the, telephone, to, work, a, fluctuating, current, reproduced, sounds, the, best, the, fluctuating, currents, became, the, basis, for, the, working, telephone, creating, bell, s, patent, that, first, patent, by, bell, was, the, master, patent, of, the, telephone, from, which, other, patents, for, electric, telephone, devices, and, features, flowed, in, 1876, shortly, after, bell, s, patent, application, hungarian, engineer, tivadar, pusk, s, proposed, the, telephone, switch, which, allowed, for, the, formation, of, telephone, exchanges, and, eventually, networks, in, the, united, kingdom, the, blower, is, used, as, a, slang, term, for, a, telephone, the, term, came, from, navy, slang, for, a, speaking, tube, in, the, u, s, a, somewhat, dated, slang, term, refers, to, the, telephone, as, the, horn, as, in, i, couldn, t, get, him, on, the, horn, or, i, ll, be, off, the, horn, in, a, moment, early, telephones, were, technically, diverse, some, used, a, water, microphone, some, had, a, metal, diaphragm, that, induced, current, in, an, electromagnet, wound, around, a, permanent, magnet, and, some, were, dynamic, their, diaphragm, vibrated, a, coil, of, wire, in, the, field, of, a, permanent, magnet, or, the, coil, vibrated, the, diaphragm, the, sound, powered, dynamic, variants, survived, in, small, numbers, through, the, 20th, century, in, military, and, maritime, applications, where, its, ability, to, create, its, own, electrical, power, was, crucial, most, however, used, the, edison, berliner, carbon, transmitter, which, was, much, louder, than, the, other, kinds, even, though, it, required, an, induction, coil, which, was, an, impedance, matching, transformer, to, make, it, compatible, with, the, impedance, of, the, line, the, edison, patents, kept, the, bell, monopoly, viable, into, the, 20th, century, by, which, time, the, network, was, more, important, than, the, instrument, early, telephones, were, locally, powered, using, either, a, dynamic, transmitter, or, by, the, powering, of, a, transmitter, with, a, local, battery, one, of, the, jobs, of, outside, plant, personnel, was, to, visit, each, telephone, periodically, to, inspect, the, battery, during, the, 20th, century, telephones, powered, from, the, telephone, exchange, over, the, same, wires, that, carried, the, voice, signals, became, common, early, telephones, used, a, single, wire, for, the, subscriber, s, line, with, ground, return, used, to, complete, the, circuit, as, used, in, telegraphs, the, earliest, dynamic, telephones, also, had, only, one, port, opening, for, sound, with, the, user, alternately, listening, and, speaking, or, rather, shouting, into, the, same, hole, sometimes, the, instruments, were, operated, in, pairs, at, each, end, making, conversation, more, convenient, but, also, more, expensive, at, first, the, benefits, of, a, telephone, exchange, were, not, exploited, instead, telephones, were, leased, in, pairs, to, a, subscriber, who, had, to, arrange, for, a, telegraph, contractor, to, construct, a, line, between, them, for, example, between, a, home, and, a, shop, users, who, wanted, the, ability, to, speak, to, several, different, locations, would, need, to, obtain, and, set, up, three, or, four, pairs, of, telephones, western, union, already, using, telegraph, exchanges, quickly, extended, the, principle, to, its, telephones, in, new, york, city, and, san, francisco, and, bell, was, not, slow, in, appreciating, the, potential, signalling, began, in, an, appropriately, primitive, manner, the, user, alerted, the, other, end, or, the, exchange, operator, by, whistling, into, the, transmitter, exchange, operation, soon, resulted, in, telephones, being, equipped, with, a, bell, in, a, ringer, box, first, operated, over, a, second, wire, and, later, over, the, same, wire, but, with, a, condenser, capacitor, in, series, with, the, bell, coil, to, allow, the, ac, ringer, signal, through, while, still, blocking, dc, keeping, the, phone, on, hook, telephones, connected, to, the, earliest, strowger, switch, automatic, exchanges, had, seven, wires, one, for, the, knife, switch, one, for, each, telegraph, key, one, for, the, bell, one, for, the, push, button, and, two, for, speaking, large, wall, telephones, in, the, early, 20th, century, usually, incorporated, the, bell, and, separate, bell, boxes, for, desk, phones, dwindled, away, in, the, middle, of, the, century, rural, and, other, telephones, that, were, not, on, a, common, battery, exchange, had, a, magneto, hand, cranked, generator, to, produce, a, high, voltage, alternating, signal, to, ring, the, bells, of, other, telephones, on, the, line, and, to, alert, the, operator, some, local, farming, communities, that, were, not, connected, to, the, main, networks, set, up, barbed, wire, telephone, lines, that, exploited, the, existing, system, of, field, fences, to, transmit, the, signal, in, the, 1890s, a, new, smaller, style, of, telephone, was, introduced, packaged, in, three, parts, the, transmitter, stood, on, a, stand, known, as, a, candlestick, for, its, shape, when, not, in, use, the, receiver, hung, on, a, hook, with, a, switch, in, it, known, as, a, switchhook, previous, telephones, required, the, user, to, operate, a, separate, switch, to, connect, either, the, voice, or, the, bell, with, the, new, kind, the, user, was, less, likely, to, leave, the, phone, off, the, hook, in, phones, connected, to, magneto, exchanges, the, bell, induction, coil, battery, and, magneto, were, in, a, separate, bell, box, or, ringer, box, in, phones, connected, to, common, battery, exchanges, the, ringer, box, was, installed, under, a, desk, or, other, out, of, the, way, place, since, it, did, not, need, a, battery, or, magneto, cradle, designs, were, also, used, at, this, time, having, a, handle, with, the, receiver, and, transmitter, attached, now, called, a, handset, separate, from, the, cradle, base, that, housed, the, magneto, crank, and, other, parts, they, were, larger, than, the, candlestick, and, more, popular, disadvantages, of, single, wire, operation, such, as, crosstalk, and, hum, from, nearby, ac, power, wires, had, already, led, to, the, use, of, twisted, pairs, and, for, long, distance, telephones, four, wire, circuits, users, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, did, not, place, long, distance, calls, from, their, own, telephones, but, made, an, appointment, and, were, connected, with, the, assistance, of, a, telephone, operator, what, turned, out, to, be, the, most, popular, and, longest, lasting, physical, style, of, telephone, was, introduced, in, the, early, 20th, century, including, bell, s, 202, type, desk, set, a, carbon, granule, transmitter, and, electromagnetic, receiver, were, united, in, a, single, molded, plastic, handle, which, when, not, in, use, was, secured, in, a, cradle, in, the, base, unit, the, circuit, diagram, of, the, model, 202, shows, the, direct, connection, of, the, transmitter, to, the, line, while, the, receiver, was, inductively, coupled, in, local, battery, configurations, when, the, local, loop, was, too, long, to, provide, sufficient, current, from, the, exchange, the, transmitter, was, powered, by, a, local, battery, and, inductively, coupled, while, the, receiver, was, included, in, the, local, loop, the, coupling, transformer, and, the, ringer, were, mounted, in, a, separate, enclosure, called, the, subscriber, set, the, dial, switch, in, the, base, interrupted, the, line, current, by, repeatedly, but, very, briefly, disconnecting, the, line, one, to, ten, times, for, each, digit, and, the, hook, switch, in, the, center, of, the, circuit, diagram, disconnected, the, line, and, the, transmitter, battery, while, the, handset, was, on, the, cradle, in, the, 1930s, telephone, sets, were, developed, that, combined, the, bell, and, induction, coil, with, the, desk, set, obviating, a, separate, ringer, box, the, rotary, dial, becoming, commonplace, in, the, 1930s, in, many, areas, enabled, customer, dialed, service, but, some, magneto, systems, remained, even, into, the, 1960s, after, world, war, ii, the, telephone, networks, saw, rapid, expansion, and, more, efficient, telephone, sets, such, as, the, model, 500, telephone, in, the, united, states, were, developed, that, permitted, larger, local, networks, centered, around, central, offices, a, breakthrough, new, technology, was, the, introduction, of, touch, tone, signaling, using, push, button, telephones, by, american, telephone, telegraph, company, at, t, in, 1963, the, invention, of, the, transistor, in, 1947, dramatically, changed, the, technology, used, in, telephone, systems, and, in, the, long, distance, transmission, networks, over, the, next, several, decades, with, the, development, of, stored, program, control, and, mos, integrated, circuits, for, electronic, switching, systems, and, new, transmission, technologies, such, as, pulse, code, modulation, pcm, telephony, gradually, evolved, towards, digital, telephony, which, improved, the, capacity, quality, and, cost, of, the, network, integrated, services, digital, network, isdn, was, launched, in, the, 1980, s, providing, businesses, and, consumers, with, access, to, digital, telephony, services, such, as, data, voice, video, and, fax, services, the, development, of, digital, data, communications, methods, made, it, possible, to, digitize, voice, and, transmit, it, as, real, time, data, across, computer, networks, and, the, internet, giving, rise, to, the, field, of, internet, protocol, ip, telephony, also, known, as, voice, over, internet, protocol, voip, voip, has, proven, to, be, a, disruptive, technology, that, is, rapidly, replacing, traditional, telephone, network, infrastructure, by, january, 2005, up, to, 10, of, telephone, subscribers, in, japan, and, south, korea, had, switched, to, this, digital, telephone, service, a, january, 2005, newsweek, article, suggested, that, internet, telephony, may, be, the, next, big, thing, the, technology, has, spawned, a, new, industry, comprising, many, voip, companies, that, offer, services, to, consumers, and, businesses, the, reported, global, voip, market, in, october, 2021, was, 85, 2, billion, with, a, projection, of, 102, 5, billion, by, 2026, ip, telephony, uses, high, bandwidth, internet, connections, and, specialized, customer, premises, equipment, to, transmit, telephone, calls, via, the, internet, or, any, modern, private, data, network, the, customer, equipment, may, be, an, analog, telephone, adapter, ata, which, translates, the, signals, of, a, conventional, analog, telephone, an, ip, phone, a, dedicated, standalone, device, or, a, computer, softphone, application, utilizing, the, microphone, and, headset, devices, of, a, personal, computer, or, smartphone, while, traditional, analog, telephones, are, typically, powered, from, the, central, office, through, the, telephone, line, digital, telephones, require, a, local, power, supply, internet, based, digital, service, also, requires, special, provisions, to, provide, the, service, location, to, the, emergency, services, when, an, emergency, telephone, number, is, called, a, cordless, telephone, or, portable, telephone, consists, of, a, base, station, unit, and, one, or, more, portable, cordless, handsets, the, base, station, connects, to, a, telephone, line, or, provides, service, by, voice, over, ip, voip, the, handset, communicates, with, the, base, station, via, radio, frequency, signals, a, handset, s, operational, range, is, limited, usually, to, within, the, same, building, or, within, a, short, distance, from, the, base, station, base, stations, include, a, radio, transceiver, which, enables, full, duplex, outgoing, and, incoming, signals, and, speech, with, the, handsets, the, base, station, often, includes, a, microphone, audio, amplifier, and, a, loudspeaker, to, enable, hands, free, speakerphone, conversations, without, needing, to, use, a, handset, the, base, station, may, also, have, a, numeric, keypad, for, dialing, and, a, display, for, caller, id, in, addition, answering, machine, function, may, be, built, in, the, cordless, handset, contains, a, rechargeable, battery, which, the, base, station, recharges, when, the, handset, rests, in, its, cradle, muilt, handset, systems, generally, also, have, additional, charging, stands, a, cordless, telephone, typically, requires, a, constant, electricity, supply, to, power, the, base, station, and, charger, units, by, means, of, a, dc, transformer, which, plugs, into, a, wall, ac, power, outlet, a, mobile, phone, or, cellphone, or, hand, phone, is, a, handheld, telephone, which, connects, via, radio, transmissions, to, a, cellular, telephone, network, the, cellular, network, consists, of, a, network, of, ground, based, transmitter, receiver, stations, with, antennas, which, are, usually, located, on, towers, or, on, buildings, and, infrastructure, connecting, to, land, based, telephone, lines, analog, cellular, networks, first, appeared, in, 1979, with, the, first, digital, cellular, networks, appearing, in, the, early, 1990s, mobile, phones, require, a, sim, card, to, be, inserted, into, the, phone, the, sim, card, is, a, small, pvc, card, containing, a, small, integrated, circuit, which, stores, the, user, s, international, mobile, subscriber, identity, imsi, number, and, its, related, key, which, are, used, to, identify, and, authenticate, subscribers, to, the, cellular, network, mobile, phones, generally, incorporate, an, lcd, or, oled, display, with, some, types, such, as, smartphones, having, touch, screens, since, the, 1990s, mobile, phones, have, gained, other, features, which, are, not, directly, related, to, their, primary, function, as, telephones, these, include, text, messaging, calendars, alarm, clocks, personal, schedulers, cameras, music, players, games, and, later, internet, access, and, smartphone, functionality, nearly, all, mobile, phones, have, the, ability, to, send, text, messages, to, other, users, via, the, sms, short, message, service, protocol, the, multimedia, messaging, service, mms, protocol, enables, users, to, send, and, receive, multimedia, content, such, as, photos, audio, files, and, video, files, as, their, functionality, has, increased, over, the, years, many, types, of, mobile, phone, notably, smartphones, require, an, operating, system, to, run, popular, mobile, phone, operating, systems, in, the, past, have, included, symbian, palm, os, blackberry, os, and, mobile, phone, versions, of, windows, as, of, 2022, the, most, used, operating, systems, are, google, s, android, and, apple, s, ios, before, the, era, of, smartphones, mobile, phones, were, generally, manufactured, by, companies, specializing, in, telecommunications, equipment, such, as, nokia, motorola, and, ericsson, since, the, advent, of, smartphones, mobile, phone, manufacturers, have, also, included, consumer, electronics, companies, such, as, apple, samsung, and, xiaomi, as, of, 2022, most, mobile, phones, are, smartphones, being, a, combination, of, a, mobile, phone, and, a, personal, computing, device, in, the, same, unit, most, smartphones, are, primarily, operated, using, a, graphical, user, interface, and, a, touch, screen, many, phones, have, a, secondary, voice, user, interface, such, as, siri, on, apple, iphones, which, can, operate, many, of, the, device, s, functions, as, well, as, enabling, users, to, use, spoken, commands, to, interact, with, the, internet, typically, alphanumeric, text, input, is, accomplished, via, an, on, screen, virtual, keyboard, although, some, smartphones, have, a, small, physical, keyboard, smartphones, offer, the, ability, to, access, internet, data, through, the, cellular, network, and, via, wi, fi, and, usually, allow, direct, connectivity, to, other, devices, via, bluetooth, or, a, wired, interface, such, as, usb, or, lightning, connectors, smartphones, being, able, to, run, apps, have, vastly, expanded, functionality, compared, to, previous, mobile, phones, having, internet, access, and, built, in, cameras, smartphones, have, made, video, calling, readily, accessible, via, ip, connections, smartphones, also, have, access, to, a, large, number, of, web, services, and, web, apps, giving, them, functionality, similar, to, traditional, computers, although, smartphones, are, often, limited, by, their, relatively, small, screen, size, and, the, size, of, their, keyboards, typically, smartphones, feature, such, tools, as, cameras, media, players, web, browsers, email, clients, interactive, maps, satellite, navigation, and, a, variety, of, sensors, such, as, a, compass, accelerometers, and, gps, receivers, in, addition, to, voice, calls, smartphone, users, commonly, communicate, using, a, wide, variety, of, messaging, formats, including, sms, mms, email, and, various, proprietary, messaging, services, such, as, imessage, and, various, social, media, platforms, in, 2002, only, 10, of, the, world, s, population, used, mobile, phones, and, by, 2005, that, percentage, had, risen, to, 46, by, the, end, of, 2009, there, were, a, total, of, nearly, 6, billion, mobile, and, fixed, line, telephone, subscribers, worldwide, this, included, 1, 26, billion, fixed, line, subscribers, and, 4, 6, billion, mobile, subscribers
