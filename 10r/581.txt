a, lens, is, a, transmissive, optical, device, that, focuses, or, disperses, a, light, beam, by, means, of, refraction, a, simple, lens, consists, of, a, single, piece, of, transparent, material, while, a, compound, lens, consists, of, several, simple, lenses, elements, usually, arranged, along, a, common, axis, lenses, are, made, from, materials, such, as, glass, or, plastic, and, are, ground, polished, or, molded, to, the, required, shape, a, lens, can, focus, light, to, form, an, image, unlike, a, prism, which, refracts, light, without, focusing, devices, that, similarly, focus, or, disperse, waves, and, radiation, other, than, visible, light, are, also, called, lenses, such, as, microwave, lenses, electron, lenses, acoustic, lenses, or, explosive, lenses, lenses, are, used, in, various, imaging, devices, such, as, telescopes, binoculars, and, cameras, they, are, also, used, as, visual, aids, in, glasses, to, correct, defects, of, vision, such, as, myopia, and, hypermetropia, the, word, lens, comes, from, l, ns, the, latin, name, of, the, lentil, a, seed, of, a, lentil, plant, because, a, double, convex, lens, is, lentil, shaped, the, lentil, also, gives, its, name, to, a, geometric, figure, some, scholars, argue, that, the, archeological, evidence, indicates, that, there, was, widespread, use, of, lenses, in, antiquity, spanning, several, millennia, the, so, called, nimrud, lens, is, a, rock, crystal, artifact, dated, to, the, 7th, century, bce, which, may, or, may, not, have, been, used, as, a, magnifying, glass, or, a, burning, glass, others, have, suggested, that, certain, egyptian, hieroglyphs, depict, simple, glass, meniscal, lenses, the, oldest, certain, reference, to, the, use, of, lenses, is, from, aristophanes, play, the, clouds, 424, bce, mentioning, a, burning, glass, pliny, the, elder, 1st, century, confirms, that, burning, glasses, were, known, in, the, roman, period, pliny, also, has, the, earliest, known, reference, to, the, use, of, a, corrective, lens, when, he, mentions, that, nero, was, said, to, watch, the, gladiatorial, games, using, an, emerald, presumably, concave, to, correct, for, nearsightedness, though, the, reference, is, vague, both, pliny, and, seneca, the, younger, 3, bc, 65, ad, described, the, magnifying, effect, of, a, glass, globe, filled, with, water, ptolemy, 2nd, century, wrote, a, book, on, optics, which, however, survives, only, in, the, latin, translation, of, an, incomplete, and, very, poor, arabic, translation, the, book, was, however, received, by, medieval, scholars, in, the, islamic, world, and, commented, upon, by, ibn, sahl, 10th, century, who, was, in, turn, improved, upon, by, alhazen, book, of, optics, 11th, century, the, arabic, translation, of, ptolemy, s, optics, became, available, in, latin, translation, in, the, 12th, century, eugenius, of, palermo, 1154, between, the, 11th, and, 13th, century, reading, stones, were, invented, these, were, primitive, plano, convex, lenses, initially, made, by, cutting, a, glass, sphere, in, half, the, medieval, 11th, or, 12th, century, rock, crystal, visby, lenses, may, or, may, not, have, been, intended, for, use, as, burning, glasses, spectacles, were, invented, as, an, improvement, of, the, reading, stones, of, the, high, medieval, period, in, northern, italy, in, the, second, half, of, the, 13th, century, this, was, the, start, of, the, optical, industry, of, grinding, and, polishing, lenses, for, spectacles, first, in, venice, and, florence, in, the, late, 13th, century, and, later, in, the, spectacle, making, centres, in, both, the, netherlands, and, germany, spectacle, makers, created, improved, types, of, lenses, for, the, correction, of, vision, based, more, on, empirical, knowledge, gained, from, observing, the, effects, of, the, lenses, probably, without, the, knowledge, of, the, rudimentary, optical, theory, of, the, day, the, practical, development, and, experimentation, with, lenses, led, to, the, invention, of, the, compound, optical, microscope, around, 1595, and, the, refracting, telescope, in, 1608, both, of, which, appeared, in, the, spectacle, making, centres, in, the, netherlands, with, the, invention, of, the, telescope, and, microscope, there, was, a, great, deal, of, experimentation, with, lens, shapes, in, the, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, by, those, trying, to, correct, chromatic, errors, seen, in, lenses, opticians, tried, to, construct, lenses, of, varying, forms, of, curvature, wrongly, assuming, errors, arose, from, defects, in, the, spherical, figure, of, their, surfaces, optical, theory, on, refraction, and, experimentation, was, showing, no, single, element, lens, could, bring, all, colours, to, a, focus, this, led, to, the, invention, of, the, compound, achromatic, lens, by, chester, moore, hall, in, england, in, 1733, an, invention, also, claimed, by, fellow, englishman, john, dollond, in, a, 1758, patent, developments, in, transatlantic, commerce, were, the, impetus, for, the, construction, of, modern, lighthouses, in, the, 18th, century, which, utilize, a, combination, of, elevated, sightlines, lighting, sources, and, lenses, to, provide, navigational, aid, overseas, with, maximal, distance, of, visibility, needed, in, lighthouses, conventional, convex, lenses, would, need, to, be, significantly, sized, which, would, negatively, affect, the, development, of, lighthouses, in, terms, of, cost, design, and, implementation, fresnel, lens, were, developed, that, considered, these, constraints, by, featuring, less, material, through, their, concentric, annular, sectioning, they, were, first, fully, implemented, into, a, lighthouse, in, 1823, most, lenses, are, spherical, lenses, their, two, surfaces, are, parts, of, the, surfaces, of, spheres, each, surface, can, be, convex, bulging, outwards, from, the, lens, concave, depressed, into, the, lens, or, planar, flat, the, line, joining, the, centres, of, the, spheres, making, up, the, lens, surfaces, is, called, the, axis, of, the, lens, typically, the, lens, axis, passes, through, the, physical, centre, of, the, lens, because, of, the, way, they, are, manufactured, lenses, may, be, cut, or, ground, after, manufacturing, to, give, them, a, different, shape, or, size, the, lens, axis, may, then, not, pass, through, the, physical, centre, of, the, lens, toric, or, sphero, cylindrical, lenses, have, surfaces, with, two, different, radii, of, curvature, in, two, orthogonal, planes, they, have, a, different, focal, power, in, different, meridians, this, forms, an, astigmatic, lens, an, example, is, eyeglass, lenses, that, are, used, to, correct, astigmatism, in, someone, s, eye, lenses, are, classified, by, the, curvature, of, the, two, optical, surfaces, a, lens, is, biconvex, or, double, convex, or, just, convex, if, both, surfaces, are, convex, if, both, surfaces, have, the, same, radius, of, curvature, the, lens, is, equiconvex, a, lens, with, two, concave, surfaces, is, biconcave, or, just, concave, if, one, of, the, surfaces, is, flat, the, lens, is, plano, convex, or, plano, concave, depending, on, the, curvature, of, the, other, surface, a, lens, with, one, convex, and, one, concave, side, is, convex, concave, or, meniscus, convex, concave, lenses, are, most, commonly, used, in, corrective, lenses, since, the, shape, minimizes, some, aberrations, for, a, biconvex, or, plano, convex, lens, in, a, lower, index, medium, a, collimated, beam, of, light, passing, through, the, lens, converges, to, a, spot, a, focus, behind, the, lens, in, this, case, the, lens, is, called, a, positive, or, converging, lens, for, a, thin, lens, in, air, the, distance, from, the, lens, to, the, spot, is, the, focal, length, of, the, lens, which, is, commonly, represented, by, f, in, diagrams, and, equations, an, extended, hemispherical, lens, is, a, special, type, of, plano, convex, lens, in, which, the, lens, s, curved, surface, is, a, full, hemisphere, and, the, lens, is, much, thicker, than, the, radius, of, curvature, another, extreme, case, of, a, thick, convex, lens, is, a, ball, lens, whose, shape, is, completely, round, when, used, in, novelty, photography, it, is, often, called, a, lensball, a, ball, shaped, lens, has, the, advantage, of, being, omnidirectional, but, for, most, optical, glass, types, its, focal, point, lies, close, to, the, ball, s, surface, because, of, the, ball, s, curvature, extremes, compared, to, the, lens, size, optical, aberration, is, much, worse, than, thin, lenses, with, the, notable, exception, of, chromatic, aberration, for, a, biconcave, or, plano, concave, lens, in, a, lower, index, medium, a, collimated, beam, of, light, passing, through, the, lens, is, diverged, spread, the, lens, is, thus, called, a, negative, or, diverging, lens, the, beam, after, passing, through, the, lens, appears, to, emanate, from, a, particular, point, on, the, axis, in, front, of, the, lens, for, a, thin, lens, in, air, the, distance, from, this, point, to, the, lens, is, the, focal, length, though, it, is, negative, with, respect, to, the, focal, length, of, a, converging, lens, the, behavior, reverses, when, a, lens, is, placed, in, a, medium, with, higher, refractive, index, than, the, material, of, the, lens, in, this, case, a, biconvex, or, plano, convex, lens, diverges, light, and, a, biconcave, or, plano, concave, one, converges, it, convex, concave, meniscus, lenses, can, be, either, positive, or, negative, depending, on, the, relative, curvatures, of, the, two, surfaces, a, negative, meniscus, lens, has, a, steeper, concave, surface, with, a, shorter, radius, than, the, convex, surface, and, is, thinner, at, the, centre, than, at, the, periphery, conversely, a, positive, meniscus, lens, has, a, steeper, convex, surface, with, a, shorter, radius, than, the, concave, surface, and, is, thicker, at, the, centre, than, at, the, periphery, an, ideal, thin, lens, with, two, surfaces, of, equal, curvature, also, equal, in, the, sign, would, have, zero, optical, power, as, its, focal, length, becomes, infinity, as, shown, in, the, lensmaker, s, equation, meaning, that, it, would, neither, converge, nor, diverge, light, all, real, lenses, have, a, nonzero, thickness, however, which, makes, a, real, lens, with, identical, curved, surfaces, slightly, positive, to, obtain, exactly, zero, optical, power, a, meniscus, lens, must, have, slightly, unequal, curvatures, to, account, for, the, effect, of, the, lens, thickness, for, a, single, refraction, for, a, circular, boundary, the, relation, between, object, and, its, image, in, the, paraxial, approximation, is, given, by, n, 1, u, n, 2, v, n, 2, n, 1, r, displaystyle,

the, optical, power, in, dioptres, inverse, metres, lenses, have, the, same, focal, length, when, light, travels, from, the, back, to, the, front, as, when, light, goes, from, the, front, to, the, back, other, properties, of, the, lens, such, as, the, aberrations, are, not, the, same, in, both, directions, the, signs, of, the, lens, radii, of, curvature, indicate, whether, the, corresponding, surfaces, are, convex, or, concave, the, sign, convention, used, to, represent, this, varies, but, in, this, article, a, positive, r, indicates, a, surface, s, center, of, curvature, is, further,

if, an, object, is, placed, at, a, distance, s, 1, f, from, a, positive, lens, of, focal, length, f, we, will, find, an, image, at, a, distance, s, 2, according, to, this, formula, if, a, screen, is, placed, at, a, distance, s, 2, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, lens, an, image, is, formed, on, it, this, sort, of, image, which, can, be, projected, onto, a, screen, or, image, sensor, is, known, as, a, real, image, this, is, the, principle, of, the, camera, and, also, of, the, human, eye, in, which, the, retina, serves, as, the, image, sensor, the, focusing, adjustment, of, a, camera, adjusts, s, 2, as, using, an, image, distance, different, from, that, required, by, this, formula, produces, a, defocused, fuzzy, image, for, an, object, at, a, distance, of, s, 1, from, the, camera, put, another, way, modifying, s, 2, causes, objects, at, a, different, s, 1, to, come, into, perfect, focus, in, some, cases, s, 2, is, negative, indicating, that, the, image, is, formed, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, lens, from, where, those, rays, are, being, considered, since, the, diverging, light, rays, emanating, from, the, lens, never, come, into, focus, and, those, rays, are, not, physically, present, at, the, point, where, they, appear, to, form, an, image, this, is, called, a, virtual, image, unlike, real, images, a, virtual, image, cannot, be, projected, on, a, screen, but, appears, to, an, observer, looking, through, the, lens, as, if, it, were, a, real, object, at, the, location, of, that, virtual, image, likewise, it, appears, to, a, subsequent, lens, as, if, it, were, an, object, at, that, location, so, that, second, lens, could, again, focus, that, light, into, a, real, image, s, 1, then, being, measured, from, the, virtual, image, location, behind, the, first, lens, to, the, second, lens, this, is, exactly, what, the, eye, does, when, looking, through, a, magnifying, glass, the, magnifying, glass, creates, a, magnified, virtual, image, behind, the, magnifying, glass, but, those, rays, are, then, re, imaged, by, the, lens, of, the, eye, to, create, a, real, image, on, the, retina, using, a, positive, lens, of, focal, length, f, a, virtual, image, results, when, s, 1, f, the, lens, thus, being, used, as, a, magnifying, glass, rather, than, if, s, 1, f, as, for, a, camera, using, a, negative, lens, f, 0, with, a, real, object, s, 1, 0, can, only, produce, a, virtual, image, s, 2, 0, according, to, the, above, formula, it, is, also, possible, for, the, object, distance, s, 1, to, be, negative, in, which, case, the, lens, sees, a, so, called, virtual, object, this, happens, when, the, lens, is, inserted, into, a, converging, beam, being, focused, by, a, previous, lens, before, the, location, of, its, real, image, in, that, case, even, a, negative, lens, can, project, a, real, image, as, is, done, by, a, barlow, lens, for, a, thin, lens, the, distances, s, 1, and, s, 2, are, measured, from, the, object, and, image, to, the, position, of, the, lens, as, described, above, when, the, thickness, of, the, lens, is, not, much, smaller, than, s, 1, and, s, 2, or, there, are, multiple, lens, elements, a, compound, lens, one, must, instead, measure, from, the, object, and, image, to, the, principal, planes, of, the, lens, if, distances, s, 1, or, s, 2, pass, through, a, medium, other, than, air, or, vacuum, a, more, complicated, analysis, is, required, the, linear, magnification, of, an, imaging, system, using, a, single, lens, is, given, by, m, s, 2, s, 1, f, f, s, 1, displaystyle, m, frac, s, 2, s, 1, frac, f, f, s, 1, where, m, is, the, magnification, factor, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, size, of, an, image, compared, to, the, size, of, the, object, the, sign, convention, here, dictates, that, if, m, is, negative, as, it, is, for, real, images, the, image, is, upside, down, with, respect, to, the, object, for, virtual, images, m, is, positive, so, the, image, is, upright, this, magnification, formula, provides, two, easy, ways, to, distinguish, converging, f, 0, and, diverging, f, 0, lenses, for, an, object, very, close, to, the, lens, 0, s, 1, f, a, converging, lens, would, form, a, magnified, bigger, virtual, image, whereas, a, diverging, lens, would, form, a, demagnified, smaller, image, for, an, object, very, far, from, the, lens, s, 1, f, 0, a, converging, lens, would, form, an, inverted, image, whereas, a, diverging, lens, would, form, an, upright, image, linear, magnification, m, is, not, always, the, most, useful, measure, of, magnifying, power, for, instance, when, characterizing, a, visual, telescope, or, binoculars, that, produce, only, a, virtual, image, one, would, be, more, concerned, with, the, angular, magnification, which, expresses, how, much, larger, a, distant, object, appears, through, the, telescope, compared, to, the, naked, eye, in, the, case, of, a, camera, one, would, quote, the, plate, scale, which, compares, the, apparent, angular, size, of, a, distant, object, to, the, size, of, the, real, image, produced, at, the, focus, the, plate, scale, is, the, reciprocal, of, the, focal, length, of, the, camera, lens, lenses, are, categorized, as, long, focus, lenses, or, wide, angle, lenses, according, to, their, focal, lengths, using, an, inappropriate, measurement, of, magnification, can, be, formally, correct, but, yield, a, meaningless, number, for, instance, using, a, magnifying, glass, of, 5, cm, focal, length, held, 20, cm, from, the, eye, and, 5, cm, from, the, object, produces, a, virtual, image, at, infinity, of, infinite, linear, size, m, but, the, angular, magnification, is, 5, meaning, that, the, object, appears, 5, times, larger, to, the, eye, than, without, the, lens, when, taking, a, picture, of, the, moon, using, a, camera, with, a, 50, mm, lens, one, is, not, concerned, with, the, linear, magnification, m, 50, mm, 380, 000, km, 1, 3, 10, 10, rather, the, plate, scale, of, the, camera, is, about, 1, mm, from, which, one, can, conclude, that, the, 0, 5, mm, image, on, the, film, corresponds, to, an, angular, size, of, the, moon, seen, from, earth, of, about, 0, 5, in, the, extreme, case, where, an, object, is, an, infinite, distance, away, s, 1, s, 2, f, and, m, f, 0, indicating, that, the, object, would, be, imaged, to, a, single, point, in, the, focal, plane, in, fact, the, diameter, of, the, projected, spot, is, not, actually, zero, since, diffraction, places, a, lower, limit, on, the, size, of, the, point, spread, function, this, is, called, the, diffraction, limit, lenses, do, not, form, perfect, images, and, always, introduce, some, degree, of, distortion, or, aberration, that, makes, the, image, an, imperfect, replica, of, the, object, careful, design, of, the, lens, system, for, a, particular, application, minimizes, the, aberration, several, types, of, aberration, affect, image, quality, including, spherical, aberration, coma, and, chromatic, aberration, spherical, aberration, occurs, because, spherical, surfaces, are, not, the, ideal, shape, for, a, lens, but, are, by, far, the, simplest, shape, to, which, glass, can, be, ground, and, polished, and, so, are, often, used, spherical, aberration, causes, beams, parallel, to, but, distant, from, the, lens, axis, to, be, focused, in, a, slightly, different, place, than, beams, close, to, the, axis, this, manifests, itself, as, a, blurring, of, the, image, spherical, aberration, can, be, minimised, with, normal, lens, shapes, by, carefully, choosing, the, surface, curvatures, for, a, particular, application, for, instance, a, plano, convex, lens, which, is, used, to, focus, a, collimated, beam, produces, a, sharper, focal, spot, when, used, with, the, convex, side, towards, the, beam, source, coma, or, comatic, aberration, derives, its, name, from, the, comet, like, appearance, of, the, aberrated, image, coma, occurs, when, an, object, off, the, optical, axis, of, the, lens, is, imaged, where, rays, pass, through, the, lens, at, an, angle, to, the, axis, rays, that, pass, through, the, centre, of, a, lens, of, focal, length, f, are, focused, at, a, point, with, distance, f, tan, from, the, axis, rays, passing, through, the, outer, margins, of, the, lens, are, focused, at, different, points, either, further, from, the, axis, positive, coma, or, closer, to, the, axis, negative, coma, in, general, a, bundle, of, parallel, rays, passing, through, the, lens, at, a, fixed, distance, from, the, centre, of, the, lens, are, focused, to, a, ring, shaped, image, in, the, focal, plane, known, as, a, comatic, circle, the, sum, of, all, these, circles, results, in, a, v, shaped, or, comet, like, flare, as, with, spherical, aberration, coma, can, be, minimised, and, in, some, cases, eliminated, by, choosing, the, curvature, of, the, two, lens, surfaces, to, match, the, application, lenses, in, which, both, spherical, aberration, and, coma, are, minimised, are, called, bestform, lenses, chromatic, aberration, is, caused, by, the, dispersion, of, the, lens, material, the, variation, of, its, refractive, index, n, with, the, wavelength, of, light, since, from, the, formulae, above, f, is, dependent, upon, n, it, follows, that, light, of, different, wavelengths, is, focused, to, different, positions, chromatic, aberration, of, a, lens, is, seen, as, fringes, of, colour, around, the, image, it, can, be, minimised, by, using, an, achromatic, doublet, or, achromat, in, which, two, materials, with, differing, dispersion, are, bonded, together, to, form, a, single, lens, this, reduces, the, amount, of, chromatic, aberration, over, a, certain, range, of, wavelengths, though, it, does, not, produce, perfect, correction, the, use, of, achromats, was, an, important, step, in, the, development, of, the, optical, microscope, an, apochromat, is, a, lens, or, lens, system, with, even, better, chromatic, aberration, correction, combined, with, improved, spherical, aberration, correction, apochromats, are, much, more, expensive, than, achromats, different, lens, materials, may, also, be, used, to, minimise, chromatic, aberration, such, as, specialised, coatings, or, lenses, made, from, the, crystal, fluorite, this, naturally, occurring, substance, has, the, highest, known, abbe, number, indicating, that, the, material, has, low, dispersion, other, kinds, of, aberration, include, field, curvature, barrel, and, pincushion, distortion, and, astigmatism, even, if, a, lens, is, designed, to, minimize, or, eliminate, the, aberrations, described, above, the, image, quality, is, still, limited, by, the, diffraction, of, light, passing, through, the, lens, finite, aperture, a, diffraction, limited, lens, is, one, in, which, aberrations, have, been, reduced, to, the, point, where, the, image, quality, is, primarily, limited, by, diffraction, under, the, design, conditions, simple, lenses, are, subject, to, the, optical, aberrations, discussed, above, in, many, cases, these, aberrations, can, be, compensated, for, to, a, great, extent, by, using, a, combination, of, simple, lenses, with, complementary, aberrations, a, compound, lens, is, a, collection, of, simple, lenses, of, different, shapes, and, made, of, materials, of, different, refractive, indices, arranged, one, after, the, other, with, a, common, axis, in, a, multiple, lens, system, each, lens, treats, the, previous, lens, s, image, as, an, object, and, produces, a, new, image, of, it, so, that, the, imaging, is, cascaded, through, the, lenses, this, is, easy, to, understand, when, the, image, from, one, lens, is, before, the, front, focus, of, the, next, lens, but, it, remains, true, even, when, the, intermediate, image, is, located, within, the, focal, length, of, the, next, lens, or, even, beyond, it, for, a, two, lens, system, the, object, distances, of, each, lens, can, be, denoted, as, s, o, 1, textstyle, s, o1, and, s, o, 2, textstyle, s, o2, and, the, image, distances, as, and, s, i, 1, textstyle, s, i1, and, s, i, 2, textstyle, s, i2, if, the, lenses, are, thin, each, satisfies, the, thin, lens, formula, 1, f, j, 1, s, o, j, 1, s, i, j, displaystyle, frac, 1, f, j, frac, 1, s, oj, frac, 1, s, ij, if, the, distance, between, the, two, lenses, is, d, displaystyle, d, then, s, o, 2, d, s, i, 1, textstyle, s, o2, d, s, i1, the, 2nd, lens, images, the, image, of, the, first, lens, ffd, front, focal, distance, is, defined, as, the, distance, between, the, front, left, focal, point, of, an, optical, system, and, its, nearest, optical, surface, vertex, if, an, object, is, located, at, the, front, focal, point, of, the, system, then, its, image, made, by, the, system, is, located, infinitely, far, way, to, the, right, i, e, light, rays, from, the, object, is, collimated, after, the, system, to, do, this, the, image, of, the, 1st, lens, is, located, at, the, focal, point, of, the, 2nd, lens, i, e, s, i, 1, d, f, 2, displaystyle, s, i1, d, f, 2, so, the, thin, lens, formula, for, the, 1st, lens, becomes, 1, f, 1, 1, f, f, d, 1, d, f, 2, f, f, d, f, 1, d, f, 2, d, f, 1, f, 2, displaystyle, frac, 1, f, 1, frac, 1, ffd, frac, 1, d, f, 2, rightarrow, ffd, frac, f, 1, d, f, 2, d, f, 1, f, 2, bfd, back, focal, distance, is, similarly, defined, as, the, distance, between, the, back, right, focal, point, of, an, optical, system, and, its, nearest, optical, surface, vertex, if, an, object, is, located, infinitely, far, away, from, the, system, to, the, left, then, its, image, made, by, the, system, is, located, at, the, back, focal, point, in, this, case, the, 1st, lens, images, the, object, at, its, focal, point, so, the, thin, lens, formula, for, the, 2nd, lens, becomes, 1, f, 2, 1, b, f, d, 1, d, f, 1, b, f, d, f, 2, d, f, 1, d, f, 1, f, 2, displaystyle, frac, 1, f, 2, frac, 1, bfd, frac, 1, d, f, 1, rightarrow, bfd, frac, f, 2, d, f, 1, d, f, 1, f, 2, a, simplest, case, is, where, thin, lenses, are, placed, in, contact, d, 0, displaystyle, d, 0, then, the, combined, focal, length, f, of, the, lenses, is, given, by, 1, f, 1, f, 1, 1, f, 2, displaystyle, frac, 1, f, frac, 1, f, 1, frac, 1, f, 2, since, 1, f, is, the, power, of, a, lens, with, focal, length, f, it, can, be, seen, that, the, powers, of, thin, lenses, in, contact, are, additive, the, general, case, of, multiple, thin, lenses, in, contact, is, 1, f, k, 1, n, 1, f, k, displaystyle, frac, 1, f, sum, k, 1, n, frac, 1, f, k, where, n, textstyle, n, is, the, number, of, lenses, if, two, thin, lenses, are, separated, in, air, by, some, distance, d, then, the, focal, length, for, the, combined, system, is, given, by, 1, f, 1, f, 1, 1, f, 2, d, f, 1, f, 2, displaystyle, frac, 1, f, frac, 1, f, 1, frac, 1, f, 2, frac, d, f, 1, f, 2, as, d, tends, to, zero, the, focal, length, of, the, system, tends, to, the, value, of, f, given, for, thin, lenses, in, contact, it, can, be, shown, that, the, same, formula, works, for, thick, lenses, if, d, is, taken, as, the, distance, between, their, principal, planes, if, the, separation, distance, between, two, lenses, is, equal, to, the, sum, of, their, focal, lengths, d, f, 1, f, 2, then, the, ffd, and, bfd, are, infinite, this, corresponds, to, a, pair, of, lenses, that, transforms, a, parallel, collimated, beam, into, another, collimated, beam, this, type, of, system, is, called, an, afocal, system, since, it, produces, no, net, convergence, or, divergence, of, the, beam, two, lenses, at, this, separation, form, the, simplest, type, of, optical, telescope, although, the, system, does, not, alter, the, divergence, of, a, collimated, beam, it, does, alter, the, transverse, width, of, the, beam, the, magnification, of, such, a, telescope, is, given, by, m, f, 2, f, 1, displaystyle, m, frac, f, 2, f, 1, which, is, the, ratio, of, the, output, beam, width, to, the, input, beam, width, note, the, sign, convention, a, telescope, with, two, convex, lenses, f, 1, 0, f, 2, 0, produces, a, negative, magnification, indicating, an, inverted, image, a, convex, plus, a, concave, lens, f, 1, 0, f, 2, produces, a, positive, magnification, and, the, image, is, upright, for, further, information, on, simple, optical, telescopes, see, refracting, telescope, refracting, telescope, designs, cylindrical, lenses, have, curvature, along, only, one, axis, they, are, used, to, focus, light, into, a, line, or, to, convert, the, elliptical, light, from, a, laser, diode, into, a, round, beam, they, are, also, used, in, motion, picture, anamorphic, lenses, aspheric, lenses, have, at, least, one, surface, that, is, neither, spherical, nor, cylindrical, the, more, complicated, shapes, allow, such, lenses, to, form, images, with, less, aberration, than, standard, simple, lenses, but, they, are, more, difficult, and, expensive, to, produce, these, were, formerly, complex, to, make, and, often, extremely, expensive, but, advances, in, technology, have, greatly, reduced, the, manufacturing, cost, for, such, lenses, a, fresnel, lens, has, its, optical, surface, broken, up, into, narrow, rings, allowing, the, lens, to, be, much, thinner, and, lighter, than, conventional, lenses, durable, fresnel, lenses, can, be, molded, from, plastic, and, are, inexpensive, lenticular, lenses, are, arrays, of, microlenses, that, are, used, in, lenticular, printing, to, make, images, that, have, an, illusion, of, depth, or, that, change, when, viewed, from, different, angles, bifocal, lens, has, two, or, more, or, a, graduated, focal, lengths, ground, into, the, lens, a, gradient, index, lens, has, flat, optical, surfaces, but, has, a, radial, or, axial, variation, in, index, of, refraction, that, causes, light, passing, through, the, lens, to, be, focused, an, axicon, has, a, conical, optical, surface, it, images, a, point, source, into, a, line, along, the, optic, axis, or, transforms, a,

resolutions, exceeding, the, diffraction, limit, the, first, superlenses, were, made, in, 2004, using, such, a, metamaterial, for, microwaves, improved, versions, have, been, made, by, other, researchers, as, of, 2014, the, superlens, has, not, yet, been, demonstrated, at, visible, or, near, infrared, wavelengths, a, prototype, flat, ultrathin, lens, with, no, curvature, has, been, developed, a, single, convex, lens, mounted, in, a, frame, with, a, handle, or, stand, is, a, magnifying, glass, lenses, are, used, as, prosthetics, for, the, correction, of, refractive, errors, such, as, myopia, hypermetropia, presbyopia, and, astigmatism, see, corrective, lens, contact, lens, eyeglasses, intraocular, lens, most, lenses, used, for, other, purposes, have, strict, axial, symmetry, eyeglass, lenses, are, only, approximately, symmetric, they, are, usually, shaped, to, fit, in, a, roughly, oval, not, circular, frame, the, optical, centres, are, placed, over, the, eyeballs, their, curvature, may, not, be, axially, symmetric, to, correct, for, astigmatism, sunglasses, lenses, are, designed, to, attenuate, light, sunglass, lenses, that, also, correct, visual, impairments, can, be, custom, made, other, uses, are, in, imaging, systems, such, as, monoculars, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes, cameras, and, projectors, some, of, these, instruments, produce, a, virtual, image, when, applied, to, the, human, eye, others, produce, a, real, image, that, can, be, captured, on, photographic, film, or, an, optical, sensor, or, can, be, viewed, on, a, screen, in, these, devices, lenses, are, sometimes, paired, up, with, curved, mirrors, to, make, a, catadioptric, system, where, the, lens, s, spherical, aberration, corrects, the, opposite, aberration, in, the, mirror, such, as, schmidt, and, meniscus, correctors, convex, lenses, produce, an, image, of, an, object, at, infinity, at, their, focus, if, the, sun, is, imaged, much, of, the, visible, and, infrared, light, incident, on, the, lens, is, concentrated, into, the, small, image, a, large, lens, creates, enough, intensity, to, burn, a, flammable, object, at, the, focal, point, since, ignition, can, be, achieved, even, with, a, poorly, made, lens, lenses, have, been, used, as, burning, glasses, for, at, least, 2400, years, a, modern, application, is, the, use, of, relatively, large, lenses, to,
