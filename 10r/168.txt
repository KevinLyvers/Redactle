automation, describes, a, wide, range, of, technologies, that, reduce, human, intervention, in, processes, mainly, by, predetermining, decision, criteria, subprocess, relationships, and, related, actions, as, well, as, embodying, those, predeterminations, in, machines, automation, has, been, achieved, by, various, means, including, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, electronic, devices, and, computers, usually, in, combination, complicated, systems, such, as, modern, factories, airplanes, and, ships, typically, use, combinations, of, all, of, these, techniques, the, benefit, of, automation, includes, labor, savings, reducing, waste, savings, in, electricity, costs, savings, in, material, costs, and, improvements, to, quality, accuracy, and, precision, automation, includes, the, use, of, various, equipment, and, control, systems, such, as, machinery, processes, in, factories, boilers, and, heat, treating, ovens, switching, on, telephone, networks, steering, stabilization, of, ships, aircraft, and, other, applications, and, vehicles, with, reduced, human, intervention, examples, range, from, a, household, thermostat, controlling, a, boiler, to, a, large, industrial, control, system, with, tens, of, thousands, of, input, measurements, and, output, control, signals, automation, has, also, found, a, home, in, the, banking, industry, it, can, range, from, simple, on, off, control, to, multi, variable, high, level, algorithms, in, terms, of, control, complexity, in, the, simplest, type, of, an, automatic, control, loop, a, controller, compares, a, measured, value, of, a, process, with, a, desired, set, value, and, processes, the, resulting, error, signal, to, change, some, input, to, the, process, in, such, a, way, that, the, process, stays, at, its, set, point, despite, disturbances, this, closed, loop, control, is, an, application, of, negative, feedback, to, a, system, the, mathematical, basis, of, control, theory, was, begun, in, the, 18th, century, and, advanced, rapidly, in, the, 20th, the, term, automation, inspired, by, the, earlier, word, automatic, coming, from, automaton, was, not, widely, used, before, 1947, when, ford, established, an, automation, department, it, was, during, this, time, that, the, industry, was, rapidly, adopting, feedback, controllers, which, were, introduced, in, the, 1930s, the, world, bank, s, world, development, report, of, 2019, shows, evidence, that, the, new, industries, and, jobs, in, the, technology, sector, outweigh, the, economic, effects, of, workers, being, displaced, by, automation, job, losses, and, downward, mobility, blamed, on, automation, have, been, cited, as, one, of, many, factors, in, the, resurgence, of, nationalist, protectionist, and, populist, politics, in, the, us, uk, and, france, among, other, countries, since, the, 2010s, it, was, a, preoccupation, of, the, greeks, and, arabs, in, the, period, between, about, 300, bc, and, about, 1200, ad, to, keep, accurate, track, of, time, in, ptolemaic, egypt, about, 270, bc, ctesibius, described, a, float, regulator, for, a, water, clock, a, device, not, unlike, the, ball, and, cock, in, a, modern, flush, toilet, this, was, the, earliest, feedback, controlled, mechanism, the, appearance, of, the, mechanical, clock, in, the, 14th, century, made, the, water, clock, and, its, feedback, control, system, obsolete, the, persian, ban, m, s, brothers, in, their, book, of, ingenious, devices, 850, ad, described, a, number, of, automatic, controls, two, step, level, controls, for, fluids, a, form, of, discontinuous, variable, structure, controls, were, developed, by, the, banu, musa, brothers, they, also, described, a, feedback, controller, the, design, of, feedback, control, systems, up, through, the, industrial, revolution, was, by, trial, and, error, together, with, a, great, deal, of, engineering, intuition, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 19th, century, that, the, stability, of, feedback, control, systems, was, analyzed, using, mathematics, the, formal, language, of, automatic, control, theory, the, centrifugal, governor, was, invented, by, christiaan, huygens, in, the, seventeenth, century, and, used, to, adjust, the, gap, between, millstones, the, introduction, of, prime, movers, or, self, driven, machines, advanced, grain, mills, furnaces, boilers, and, the, steam, engine, created, a, new, requirement, for, automatic, control, systems, including, temperature, regulators, invented, in, 1624, see, cornelius, drebbel, pressure, regulators, 1681, float, regulators, 1700, and, speed, control, devices, another, control, mechanism, was, used, to, tent, the, sails, of, windmills, it, was, patented, by, edmund, lee, in, 1745, also, in, 1745, jacques, de, vaucanson, invented, the, first, automated, loom, around, 1800, joseph, marie, jacquard, created, a, punch, card, system, to, program, looms, in, 1771, richard, arkwright, invented, the, first, fully, automated, spinning, mill, driven, by, water, power, known, at, the, time, as, the, water, frame, an, automatic, flour, mill, was, developed, by, oliver, evans, in, 1785, making, it, the, first, completely, automated, industrial, process, a, centrifugal, governor, was, used, by, mr, bunce, of, england, in, 1784, as, part, of, a, model, steam, crane, the, centrifugal, governor, was, adopted, by, james, watt, for, use, on, a, steam, engine, in, 1788, after, watt, s, partner, boulton, saw, one, at, a, flour, mill, boulton, watt, were, building, the, governor, could, not, actually, hold, a, set, speed, the, engine, would, assume, a, new, constant, speed, in, response, to, load, changes, the, governor, was, able, to, handle, smaller, variations, such, as, those, caused, by, fluctuating, heat, load, to, the, boiler, also, there, was, a, tendency, for, oscillation, whenever, there, was, a, speed, change, as, a, consequence, engines, equipped, with, this, governor, were, not, suitable, for, operations, requiring, constant, speed, such, as, cotton, spinning, several, improvements, to, the, governor, plus, improvements, to, valve, cut, off, timing, on, the, steam, engine, made, the, engine, suitable, for, most, industrial, uses, before, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, advances, in, the, steam, engine, stayed, well, ahead, of, science, both, thermodynamics, and, control, theory, the, governor, received, relatively, little, scientific, attention, until, james, clerk, maxwell, published, a, paper, that, established, the, beginning, of, a, theoretical, basis, for, understanding, control, theory, relay, logic, was, introduced, with, factory, electrification, which, underwent, rapid, adaption, from, 1900, through, the, 1920s, central, electric, power, stations, were, also, undergoing, rapid, growth, and, the, operation, of, new, high, pressure, boilers, steam, turbines, and, electrical, substations, created, a, large, demand, for, instruments, and, controls, central, control, rooms, became, common, in, the, 1920s, but, as, late, as, the, early, 1930s, most, process, controls, were, on, off, operators, typically, monitored, charts, drawn, by, recorders, that, plotted, data, from, instruments, to, make, corrections, operators, manually, opened, or, closed, valves, or, turned, switches, on, or, off, control, rooms, also, used, color, coded, lights, to, send, signals, to, workers, in, the, plant, to, manually, make, certain, changes, the, development, of, the, electronic, amplifier, during, the, 1920s, which, was, important, for, long, distance, telephony, required, a, higher, signal, to, noise, ratio, which, was, solved, by, negative, feedback, noise, cancellation, this, and, other, telephony, applications, contributed, to, the, control, theory, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, german, mathematician, irmgard, fl, gge, lotz, developed, the, theory, of, discontinuous, automatic, controls, which, found, military, applications, during, the, second, world, war, to, fire, control, systems, and, aircraft, navigation, systems, controllers, which, were, able, to, make, calculated, changes, in, response, to, deviations, from, a, set, point, rather, than, on, off, control, began, being, introduced, in, the, 1930s, controllers, allowed, manufacturing, to, continue, showing, productivity, gains, to, offset, the, declining, influence, of, factory, electrification, factory, productivity, was, greatly, increased, by, electrification, in, the, 1920s, u, s, manufacturing, productivity, growth, fell, from, 5, 2, yr, 1919, 29, to, 2, 76, yr, 1929, 41, alexander, field, notes, that, spending, on, non, medical, instruments, increased, significantly, from, 1929, to, 1933, and, remained, strong, thereafter, the, first, and, second, world, wars, saw, major, advancements, in, the, field, of, mass, communication, and, signal, processing, other, key, advances, in, automatic, controls, include, differential, equations, stability, theory, and, system, theory, 1938, frequency, domain, analysis, 1940, ship, control, 1950, and, stochastic, analysis, 1941, starting, in, 1958, various, systems, based, on, solid, state, digital, logic, modules, for, hard, wired, programmed, logic, controllers, the, predecessors, of, programmable, logic, controllers, emerged, to, replace, electro, mechanical, relay, logic, in, industrial, control, systems, for, process, control, and, automation, including, early, telefunken, aeg, logistat, siemens, simatic, philips, mullard, valvo, norbit, bbc, sigmatronic, acec, logacec, akkord, estacord, krone, mibakron, bistat, datapac, norlog, ssr, or, procontic, systems, in, 1959, texaco, s, port, arthur, refinery, became, the, first, chemical, plant, to, use, digital, control, conversion, of, factories, to, digital, control, began, to, spread, rapidly, in, the, 1970s, as, the, price, of, computer, hardware, fell, the, automatic, telephone, switchboard, was, introduced, in, 1892, along, with, dial, telephones, by, 1929, 31, 9, of, the, bell, system, was, automatic, 158, automatic, telephone, switching, originally, used, vacuum, tube, amplifiers, and, electro, mechanical, switches, which, consumed, a, large, amount, of, electricity, call, volume, eventually, grew, so, fast, that, it, was, feared, the, telephone, system, would, consume, all, electricity, production, prompting, bell, labs, to, begin, research, on, the, transistor, the, logic, performed, by, telephone, switching, relays, was, the, inspiration, for, the, digital, computer, the, first, commercially, successful, glass, bottle, blowing, machine, was, an, automatic, model, introduced, in, 1905, the, machine, operated, by, a, two, man, crew, working, 12, hour, shifts, could, produce, 17, 280, bottles, in, 24, hours, compared, to, 2, 880, bottles, made, by, a, crew, of, six, men, and, boys, working, in, a, shop, for, a, day, the, cost, of, making, bottles, by, machine, was, 10, to, 12, cents, per, gross, compared, to, 1, 80, per, gross, by, the, manual, glassblowers, and, helpers, sectional, electric, drives, were, developed, using, control, theory, sectional, electric, drives, are, used, on, different, sections, of, a, machine, where, a, precise, differential, must, be, maintained, between, the, sections, in, steel, rolling, the, metal, elongates, as, it, passes, through, pairs, of, rollers, which, must, run, at, successively, faster, speeds, in, paper, making, paper, the, sheet, shrinks, as, it, passes, around, steam, heated, drying, arranged, in, groups, which, must, run, at, successively, slower, speeds, the, first, application, of, a, sectional, electric, drive, was, on, a, paper, machine, in, 1919, one, of, the, most, important, developments, in, the, steel, industry, during, the, 20th, century, was, continuous, wide, strip, rolling, developed, by, armco, in, 1928, before, automation, many, chemicals, were, made, in, batches, in, 1930, with, the, widespread, use, of, instruments, and, the, emerging, use, of, controllers, the, founder, of, dow, chemical, co, was, advocating, continuous, production, self, acting, machine, tools, that, displaced, hand, dexterity, so, they, could, be, operated, by, boys, and, unskilled, laborers, were, developed, by, james, nasmyth, in, the, 1840s, machine, tools, were, automated, with, numerical, control, nc, using, punched, paper, tape, in, the, 1950s, this, soon, evolved, into, computerized, numerical, control, cnc, today, extensive, automation, is, practiced, in, practically, every, type, of, manufacturing, and, assembly, process, some, of, the, larger, processes, include, electrical, power, generation, oil, refining, chemicals, steel, mills, plastics, cement, plants, fertilizer, plants, pulp, and, paper, mills, automobile, and, truck, assembly, aircraft, production, glass, manufacturing, natural, gas, separation, plants, food, and, beverage, processing, canning, and, bottling, and, manufacture, of, various, kinds, of, parts, robots, are, especially, useful, in, hazardous, applications, like, automobile, spray, painting, robots, are, also, used, to, assemble, electronic, circuit, boards, automotive, welding, is, done, with, robots, and, automatic, welders, are, used, in, applications, like, pipelines, with, the, advent, of, the, space, age, in, 1957, controls, design, particularly, in, the, united, states, turned, away, from, the, frequency, domain, techniques, of, classical, control, theory, and, backed, into, the, differential, equation, techniques, of, the, late, 19th, century, which, were, couched, in, the, time, domain, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, german, mathematician, irmgard, flugge, lotz, developed, the, theory, of, discontinuous, automatic, control, which, became, widely, used, in, hysteresis, control, systems, such, as, navigation, systems, fire, control, systems, and, electronics, through, flugge, lotz, and, others, the, modern, era, saw, time, domain, design, for, nonlinear, systems, 1961, navigation, 1960, optimal, control, and, estimation, theory, 1962, nonlinear, control, theory, 1969, digital, control, and, filtering, theory, 1974, and, the, personal, computer, 1983, perhaps, the, most, cited, advantage, of, automation, in, industry, is, that, it, is, associated, with, faster, production, and, cheaper, labor, costs, another, benefit, could, be, that, it, replaces, hard, physical, or, monotonous, work, additionally, tasks, that, take, place, in, hazardous, environments, or, that, are, otherwise, beyond, human, capabilities, can, be, done, by, machines, as, machines, can, operate, even, under, extreme, temperatures, or, in, atmospheres, that, are, radioactive, or, toxic, they, can, also, be, maintained, with, simple, quality, checks, however, at, the, time, being, not, all, tasks, can, be, automated, and, some, tasks, are, more, expensive, to, automate, than, others, initial, costs, of, installing, the, machinery, in, factory, settings, are, high, and, failure, to, maintain, a, system, could, result, in, the, loss, of, the, product, itself, moreover, some, studies, seem, to, indicate, that, industrial, automation, could, impose, ill, effects, beyond, operational, concerns, including, worker, displacement, due, to, systemic, loss, of, employment, and, compounded, environmental, damage, however, these, findings, are, both, convoluted, and, controversial, in, nature, and, could, potentially, be, circumvented, the, main, advantages, of, automation, are, automation, primarily, describes, machines, replacing, human, action, but, it, is, also, loosely, associated, with, mechanization, machines, replacing, human, labor, coupled, with, mechanization, extending, human, capabilities, in, terms, of, size, strength, speed, endurance, visual, range, acuity, hearing, frequency, precision, electromagnetic, sensing, effecting, etc, advantages, include, the, main, disadvantages, of, automation, are, the, paradox, of, automation, says, that, the, more, efficient, the, automated, system, the, more, crucial, the, human, contribution, of, the, operators, humans, are, less, involved, but, their, involvement, becomes, more, critical, lisanne, bainbridge, a, cognitive, psychologist, identified, these, issues, notably, in, her, widely, cited, paper, ironies, of, automation, if, an, automated, system, has, an, error, it, will, multiply, that, error, until, it, is, fixed, or, shut, down, this, is, where, human, operators, come, in, a, fatal, example, of, this, was, air, france, flight, 447, where, a, failure, of, automation, put, the, pilots, into, a, manual, situation, they, were, not, prepared, for, many, roles, for, humans, in, industrial, processes, presently, lie, beyond, the, scope, of, automation, human, level, pattern, recognition, language, comprehension, and, language, production, ability, are, well, beyond, the, capabilities, of, modern, mechanical, and, computer, systems, but, see, watson, computer, tasks, requiring, subjective, assessment, or, synthesis, of, complex, sensory, data, such, as, scents, and, sounds, as, well, as, high, level, tasks, such, as, strategic, planning, currently, require, human, expertise, in, many, cases, the, use, of, humans, is, more, cost, effective, than, mechanical, approaches, even, where, the, automation, of, industrial, tasks, is, possible, therefore, algorithmic, management, as, the, digital, rationalization, of, human, labor, instead, of, its, substitution, has, emerged, as, an, alternative, technological, strategy, overcoming, these, obstacles, is, a, theorized, path, to, post, scarcity, economics, increased, automation, often, causes, workers, to, feel, anxious, about, losing, their, jobs, as, technology, renders, their, skills, or, experience, unnecessary, early, in, the, industrial, revolution, when, inventions, like, the, steam, engine, were, making, some, job, categories, expendable, workers, forcefully, resisted, these, changes, luddites, for, instance, were, english, textile, workers, who, protested, the, introduction, of, weaving, machines, by, destroying, them, more, recently, some, residents, of, chandler, arizona, have, slashed, tires, and, pelted, rocks, at, self, driving, car, in, protest, over, the, cars, perceived, threat, to, human, safety, and, job, prospects, the, relative, anxiety, about, automation, reflected, in, opinion, polls, seems, to, correlate, closely, with, the, strength, of, organized, labor, in, that, region, or, nation, for, example, while, a, study, by, the, pew, research, center, indicated, that, 72, of, americans, are, worried, about, increasing, automation, in, the, workplace, 80, of, swedes, see, automation, and, artificial, intelligence, ai, as, a, good, thing, due, to, the, country, s, still, powerful, unions, and, a, more, robust, national, safety, net, in, the, u, s, 47, of, all, current, jobs, have, the, potential, to, be, fully, automated, by, 2033, according, to, the, research, of, experts, carl, benedikt, frey, and, michael, osborne, furthermore, wages, and, educational, attainment, appear, to, be, strongly, negatively, correlated, with, an, occupation, s, risk, of, being, automated, even, highly, skilled, professional, jobs, like, a, lawyer, doctor, engineer, journalist, are, at, risk, of, automation, prospects, are, particularly, bleak, for, occupations, that, do, not, presently, require, a, university, degree, such, as, truck, driving, even, in, high, tech, corridors, like, silicon, valley, concern, is, spreading, about, a, future, in, which, a, sizable, percentage, of, adults, have, little, chance, of, sustaining, gainful, employment, in, the, second, machine, age, erik, brynjolfsson, and, andrew, mcafee, argue, that, there, s, never, been, a, better, time, to, be, a, worker, with, special, skills, or, the, right, education, because, these, people, can, use, technology, to, create, and, capture, value, however, there, s, never, been, a, worse, time, to, be, a, worker, with, only, ordinary, skills, and, abilities, to, offer, because, computers, robots, and, other, digital, technologies, are, acquiring, these, skills, and, abilities, at, an, extraordinary, rate, as, the, example, of, sweden, suggests, however, the, transition, to, a, more, automated, future, need, not, inspire, panic, if, there, is, sufficient, political, will, to, promote, the, retraining, of, workers, whose, positions, are, being, rendered, obsolete, according, to, a, 2020, study, in, the, journal, of, political, economy, automation, has, robust, negative, effects, on, employment, and, wages, one, more, robot, per, thousand, workers, reduces, the, employment, to, population, ratio, by, 0, 2, percentage, points, and, wages, by, 0, 42, research, by, carl, benedikt, frey, and, michael, osborne, of, the, oxford, martin, school, argued, that, employees, engaged, in, tasks, following, well, defined, procedures, that, can, easily, be, performed, by, sophisticated, algorithms, are, at, risk, of, displacement, and, 47, of, jobs, in, the, us, were, at, risk, the, study, released, as, a, working, paper, in, 2013, and, published, in, 2017, predicted, that, automation, would, put, low, paid, physical, occupations, most, at, risk, by, surveying, a, group, of, colleagues, on, their, opinions, however, according, to, a, study, published, in, mckinsey, quarterly, in, 2015, the, impact, of, computerization, in, most, cases, is, not, the, replacement, of, employees, but, the, automation, of, portions, of, the, tasks, they, perform, the, methodology, of, the, mckinsey, study, has, been, heavily, criticized, for, being, intransparent, and, relying, on, subjective, assessments, the, methodology, of, frey, and, osborne, has, been, subjected, to, criticism, as, lacking, evidence, historical, awareness, or, credible, methodology, additionally, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, found, that, across, the, 21, oecd, countries, 9, of, jobs, are, automatable, the, obama, administration, pointed, out, that, every, 3, months, about, 6, percent, of, jobs, in, the, economy, are, destroyed, by, shrinking, or, closing, businesses, while, a, slightly, larger, percentage, of, jobs, are, added, a, recent, mit, economics, study, of, automation, in, the, u, s, from, 1990, to, 2007, found, that, there, may, be, a, negative, impact, on, employment, and, wages, when, robots, are, introduced, to, an, industry, when, one, robot, is, added, per, one, thousand, workers, the, employment, to, population, ratio, decreases, between, 0, 18, and, 0, 34, percentages, and, wages, are, reduced, by, 0, 25, 0, 5, percentage, points, during, the, time, period, studied, the, us, did, not, have, many, robots, in, the, economy, which, restricts, the, impact, of, automation, however, automation, is, expected, to, triple, conservative, estimate, or, quadruple, a, generous, estimate, leading, these, numbers, to, become, substantially, higher, based, on, a, formula, by, gilles, saint, paul, an, economist, at, toulouse, 1, university, the, demand, for, unskilled, human, capital, declines, at, a, slower, rate, than, the, demand, for, skilled, human, capital, increases, in, the, long, run, and, for, society, as, a, whole, it, has, led, to, cheaper, products, lower, average, work, hours, and, new, industries, forming, i, e, robotics, industries, computer, industries, design, industries, these, new, industries, provide, many, high, salary, skill, based, jobs, to, the, economy, by, 2030, between, 3, and, 14, percent, of, the, global, workforce, will, be, forced, to, switch, job, categories, due, to, automation, eliminating, jobs, in, an, entire, sector, while, the, number, of, jobs, lost, to, automation, is, often, offset, by, jobs, gained, from, technological, advances, the, same, type, of, job, loss, is, not, the, same, one, replaced, and, that, leading, to, increasing, unemployment, in, the, lower, middle, class, this, occurs, largely, in, the, us, and, developed, countries, where, technological, advances, contribute, to, higher, demand, for, highly, skilled, labor, but, demand, for, middle, wage, labor, continues, to, fall, economists, call, this, trend, income, polarization, where, unskilled, labor, wages, are, driven, down, and, skilled, labor, is, driven, up, and, it, is, predicted, to, continue, in, developed, economies, unemployment, is, becoming, a, problem, in, the, u, s, due, to, the, exponential, growth, rate, of, automation, and, technology, according, to, kim, kim, and, lee, 2017, 1, seminal, study, by, frey, and, osborne, in, 2013, predicted, that, 47, of, the, 702, examined, occupations, in, the, u, s, faced, a, high, risk, of, decreased, employment, rate, within, the, next, 10, 25, years, as, a, result, of, computerization, as, many, jobs, are, becoming, obsolete, which, is, causing, job, displacement, one, possible, solution, would, be, for, the, government, to, assist, with, a, universal, basic, income, ubi, program, ubi, would, be, a, guaranteed, non, taxed, income, of, around, 1000, dollars, per, month, paid, to, all, u, s, citizens, over, the, age, of, 21, ubi, would, help, those, who, are, displaced, take, on, jobs, that, pay, less, money, and, still, afford, to, get, by, it, would, also, give, those, that, are, employed, with, jobs, that, are, likely, to, be, replaced, by, automation, and, technology, extra, money, to, spend, on, education, and, training, on, new, demanding, employment, skills, ubi, however, should, be, seen, as, a, short, term, solution, as, it, doesn, t, fully, address, the, issue, of, income, inequality, which, will, be, exacerbated, by, job, displacement, lights, out, manufacturing, is, a, production, system, with, no, human, workers, to, eliminate, labor, costs, lights, out, manufacturing, grew, in, popularity, in, the, u, s, when, general, motors, in, 1982, implemented, humans, hands, off, manufacturing, to, replace, risk, averse, bureaucracy, with, automation, and, robots, however, the, factory, never, reached, full, lights, out, status, the, expansion, of, lights, out, manufacturing, requires, the, costs, of, automation, to, the, environment, are, different, depending, on, the, technology, product, or, engine, automated, there, are, automated, engines, that, consume, more, energy, resources, from, the, earth, in, comparison, with, previous, engines, and, vice, versa, hazardous, operations, such, as, oil, refining, the, manufacturing, of, industrial, chemicals, and, all, forms, of, metal, working, were, always, early, contenders, for, automation, the, automation, of, vehicles, could, prove, to, have, a, substantial, impact, on, the, environment, although, the, nature, of, this, impact, could, be, beneficial, or, harmful, depending, on, several, factors, because, automated, vehicles, are, much, less, likely, to, get, into, accidents, compared, to, human, driven, vehicles, some, precautions, built, into, current, models, such, as, anti, lock, brakes, or, laminated, glass, would, not, be, required, for, self, driving, versions, removal, of, these, safety, features, reduces, the, weight, of, the, vehicle, and, coupled, with, more, precise, acceleration, and, braking, as, well, as, fuel, efficient, route, mapping, can, increase, fuel, economy, and, reduce, emissions, despite, this, some, researchers, theorize, that, an, increase, in, the, production, of, self, driving, cars, could, lead, to, a, boom, in, vehicle, ownership, and, usage, which, could, potentially, negate, any, environmental, benefits, of, self, driving, cars, if, they, are, used, more, frequently, automation, of, homes, and, home, appliances, is, also, thought, to, impact, the, environment, a, study, of, energy, consumption, of, automated, homes, in, finland, showed, that, smart, homes, could, reduce, energy, consumption, by, monitoring, levels, of, consumption, in, different, areas, of, the, home, and, adjusting, consumption, to, reduce, energy, leaks, e, g, automatically, reducing, consumption, during, the, nighttime, when, activity, is, low, this, study, along, with, others, indicated, that, the, smart, home, s, ability, to, monitor, and, adjust, consumption, levels, would, reduce, unnecessary, energy, usage, however, some, research, suggests, that, smart, homes, might, not, be, as, efficient, as, non, automated, homes, a, more, recent, study, has, indicated, that, while, monitoring, and, adjusting, consumption, levels, do, decrease, unnecessary, energy, use, this, process, requires, monitoring, systems, that, also, consume, an, amount, of, energy, the, energy, required, to, run, these, systems, sometimes, negates, their, benefits, resulting, in, little, to, no, ecological, benefit, another, major, shift, in, automation, is, the, increased, demand, for, flexibility, and, convertibility, in, manufacturing, processes, manufacturers, are, increasingly, demanding, the, ability, to, easily, switch, from, manufacturing, product, a, to, manufacturing, product, b, without, having, to, completely, rebuild, the, production, lines, flexibility, and, distributed, processes, have, led, to, the, introduction, of, automated, guided, vehicles, with, natural, features, navigation, digital, electronics, helped, too, former, analog, based, instrumentation, was, replaced, by, digital, equivalents, which, can, be, more, accurate, and, flexible, and, offer, greater, scope, for, more, sophisticated, configuration, parametrization, and, operation, this, was, accompanied, by, the, fieldbus, revolution, which, provided, a, networked, i, e, a, single, cable, means, of, communicating, between, control, systems, and, field, level, instrumentation, eliminating, hard, wiring, discrete, manufacturing, plants, adopted, these, technologies, fast, the, more, conservative, process, industries, with, their, longer, plant, life, cycles, have, been, slower, to, adopt, and, analog, based, measurement, and, control, still, dominate, the, growing, use, of, industrial, ethernet, on, the, factory, floor, is, pushing, these, trends, still, further, enabling, manufacturing, plants, to, be, integrated, more, tightly, within, the, enterprise, via, the, internet, if, necessary, global, competition, has, also, increased, demand, for, reconfigurable, manufacturing, systems, engineers, can, now, have, numerical, control, over, automated, devices, the, result, has, been, a, rapidly, expanding, range, of, applications, and, human, activities, computer, aided, technologies, or, cax, now, serve, as, the, basis, for, mathematical, and, organizational, tools, used, to, create, complex, systems, notable, examples, of, cax, include, computer, aided, design, cad, software, and, computer, aided, manufacturing, cam, software, the, improved, design, analysis, and, manufacture, of, products, enabled, by, cax, has, been, beneficial, for, industry, information, technology, together, with, industrial, machinery, and, processes, can, assist, in, the, design, implementation, and, monitoring, of, control, systems, one, example, of, an, industrial, control, system, is, a, programmable, logic, controller, plc, plcs, are, specialized, hardened, computers, which, are, frequently, used, to, synchronize, the, flow, of, inputs, from, physical, sensors, and, events, with, the, flow, of, outputs, to, actuators, and, events, human, machine, interfaces, hmi, or, computer, human, interfaces, chi, formerly, known, as, man, machine, interfaces, are, usually, employed, to, communicate, with, plcs, and, other, computers, service, personnel, who, monitor, and, control, through, hmis, can, be, called, by, different, names, in, the, industrial, process, and, manufacturing, environments, they, are, called, operators, or, something, similar, in, boiler, houses, and, central, utility, departments, they, are, called, stationary, engineers, different, types, of, automation, tools, exist, host, simulation, software, hss, is, a, commonly, used, testing, tool, that, is, used, to, test, the, equipment, software, hss, is, used, to, test, equipment, performance, concerning, factory, automation, standards, timeouts, response, time, processing, time, cognitive, automation, as, a, subset, of, ai, is, an, emerging, genus, of, automation, enabled, by, cognitive, computing, its, primary, concern, is, the, automation, of, clerical, tasks, and, workflows, that, consist, of, structuring, unstructured, data, cognitive, automation, relies, on, multiple, disciplines, natural, language, processing, real, time, computing, machine, learning, algorithms, big, data, analytics, and, evidence, based, learning, according, to, deloitte, cognitive, automation, enables, the, replication, of, human, tasks, and, judgment, at, rapid, speeds, and, considerable, scale, such, tasks, include, artificially, intelligent, computer, aided, design, cad, can, use, text, to, 3d, image, to, 3d, and, video, to, 3d, to, automate, in, 3d, modeling, ai, cad, libraries, could, also, be, developed, using, linked, open, data, of, schematics, and, diagrams, ai, cad, assistants, are, used, as, tools, to, help, streamline, workflow, technologies, like, solar, panels, wind, turbines, and, other, renewable, energy, sources, together, with, smart, grids, micro, grids, battery, storage, can, automate, power, production, many, agricultural, operations, are, automated, with, machinery, and, equipment, to, improve, their, diagnosis, decision, making, and, or, performing, agricultural, automation, can, relieve, the, drudgery, of, agricultural, work, improve, the, timeliness, and, precision, of, agricultural, operations, raise, productivity, and, resource, use, efficiency, build, resilience, and, improve, food, quality, and, safety, increased, productivity, can, free, up, labour, allowing, agricultural, households, to, spend, more, time, elsewhere, the, technological, evolution, in, agriculture, has, resulted, in, progressive, shifts, to, digital, equipment, and, robotics, motorized, mechanization, using, engine, power, automates, the, performance, of, agricultural, operations, such, as, ploughing, and, milking, with, digital, automation, technologies, it, also, becomes, possible, to, automate, diagnosis, and, decision, making, of, agricultural, operations, for, example, autonomous, crop, robots, can, harvest, and, seed, crops, while, drones, can, gather, information, to, help, automate, input, application, precision, agriculture, often, employs, such, automation, technologies, motorized, mechanization, has, generally, increased, in, recent, years, sub, saharan, africa, is, the, only, region, where, the, adoption, of, motorized, mechanization, has, stalled, over, the, past, decades, automation, technologies, are, increasingly, used, for, managing, livestock, though, evidence, on, adoption, is, lacking, global, automatic, milking, system, sales, have, increased, over, recent, years, but, adoption, is, likely, mostly, in, northern, europe, and, likely, almost, absent, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, automated, feeding, machines, for, both, cows, and, poultry, also, exist, but, data, and, evidence, regarding, their, adoption, trends, and, drivers, is, likewise, scarce, many, supermarkets, and, even, smaller, stores, are, rapidly, introducing, self, checkout, systems, reducing, the, need, for, employing, checkout, workers, in, the, u, s, the, retail, industry, employs, 15, 9, million, people, as, of, 2017, around, 1, in, 9, americans, in, the, workforce, globally, an, estimated, 192, million, workers, could, be, affected, by, automation, according, to, research, by, eurasia, group, online, shopping, could, be, considered, a, form, of, automated, retail, as, the, payment, and, checkout, are, through, an, automated, online, transaction, processing, system, with, the, share, of, online, retail, accounting, jumping, from, 5, 1, in, 2011, to, 8, 3, in, 2016, however, two, thirds, of, books, music, and, films, are, now, purchased, online, in, addition, automation, and, online, shopping, could, reduce, demands, for, shopping, malls, and, retail, property, which, in, the, united, states, is, currently, estimated, to, account, for, 31, of, all, commercial, property, or, around, 7, billion, square, feet, 650, million, square, metres, amazon, has, gained, much, of, the, growth, in, recent, years, for, online, shopping, accounting, for, half, of, the, growth, in, online, retail, in, 2016, other, forms, of, automation, can, also, be, an, integral, part, of, online, shopping, for, example, the, deployment, of, automated, warehouse, robotics, such, as, that, applied, by, amazon, using, kiva, systems, the, food, retail, industry, has, started, to, apply, automation, to, the, ordering, process, mcdonald, s, has, introduced, touch, screen, ordering, and, payment, systems, in, many, of, its, restaurants, reducing, the, need, for, as, many, cashier, employees, the, university, of, texas, at, austin, has, introduced, fully, automated, cafe, retail, locations, some, cafes, and, restaurants, have, utilized, mobile, and, tablet, apps, to, make, the, ordering, process, more, efficient, by, customers, ordering, and, paying, on, their, device, some, restaurants, have, automated, food, delivery, to, tables, of, customers, using, a, conveyor, belt, system, the, use, of, robots, is, sometimes, employed, to, replace, waiting, staff, automation, in, construction, is, the, combination, of, methods, processes, and, systems, that, allow, for, greater, machine, autonomy, in, construction, activities, construction, automation, may, have, multiple, goals, including, but, not, limited, to, reducing, jobsite, injuries, decreasing, activity, completion, times, and, assisting, with, quality, control, and, quality, assurance, automated, mining, involves, the, removal, of, human, labor, from, the, mining, process, the, mining, industry, is, currently, in, the, transition, towards, automation, currently, it, can, still, require, a, large, amount, of, human, capital, particularly, in, the, third, world, where, labor, costs, are, low, so, there, is, less, incentive, for, increasing, efficiency, through, automation, the, defense, advanced, research, projects, agency, darpa, started, the, research, and, development, of, automated, visual, surveillance, and, monitoring, vsam, program, between, 1997, and, 1999, and, airborne, video, surveillance, avs, programs, from, 1998, to, 2002, currently, there, is, a, major, effort, underway, in, the, vision, community, to, develop, a, fully, automated, tracking, surveillance, system, automated, video, surveillance, monitors, people, and, vehicles, in, real, time, within, a, busy, environment, existing, automated, surveillance, systems, are, based, on, the, environment, they, are, primarily, designed, to, observe, i, e, indoor, outdoor, or, airborne, the, number, of, sensors, that, the, automated, system, can, handle, and, the, mobility, of, sensors, i, e, stationary, camera, vs, mobile, camera, the, purpose, of, a, surveillance, system, is, to, record, properties, and, trajectories, of, objects, in, a, given, area, generate, warnings, or, notify, the, designated, authorities, in, case, of, occurrence, of, particular, events, as, demands, for, safety, and, mobility, have, grown, and, technological, possibilities, have, multiplied, interest, in, automation, has, grown, seeking, to, accelerate, the, development, and, introduction, of, fully, automated, vehicles, and, highways, the, u, s, congress, authorized, more, than, 650, million, over, six, years, for, intelligent, transport, systems, its, and, demonstration, projects, in, the, 1991, intermodal, surface, transportation, efficiency, act, istea, congress, legislated, in, istea, that, he, secretary, of, transportation, shall, develop, an, automated, highway, and, vehicle, prototype, from, which, future, fully, automated, intelligent, vehicle, highway, systems, can, be, developed, such, development, shall, include, research, in, human, factors, to, ensure, the, success, of, the, man, machine, relationship, the, goal, of, this, program, is, to, have, the, first, fully, automated, highway, roadway, or, an, automated, test, track, in, operation, by, 1997, this, system, shall, accommodate, the, installation, of, equipment, in, new, and, existing, motor, vehicles, full, automation, commonly, defined, as, requiring, no, control, or, very, limited, control, by, the, driver, such, automation, would, be, accomplished, through, a, combination, of, sensor, computer, and, communications, systems, in, vehicles, and, along, the, roadway, fully, automated, driving, would, in, theory, allow, closer, vehicle, spacing, and, higher, speeds, which, could, enhance, traffic, capacity, in, places, where, additional, road, building, is, physically, impossible, politically, unacceptable, or, prohibitively, expensive, automated, controls, also, might, enhance, road, safety, by, reducing, the, opportunity, for, driver, error, which, causes, a, large, share, of, motor, vehicle, crashes, other, potential, benefits, include, improved, air, quality, as, a, result, of, more, efficient, traffic, flows, increased, fuel, economy, and, spin, off, technologies, generated, during, research, and, development, related, to, automated, highway, systems, automated, waste, collection, trucks, prevent, the, need, for, as, many, workers, as, well, as, easing, the, level, of, labor, required, to, provide, the, service, business, process, automation, bpa, is, the, technology, enabled, automation, of, complex, business, processes, it, can, help, to, streamline, a, business, for, simplicity, achieve, digital, transformation, increase, service, quality, improve, service, delivery, or, contain, costs, bpa, consists, of, integrating, applications, restructuring, labor, resources, and, using, software, applications, throughout, the, organization, robotic, process, automation, rpa, or, rpaai, for, self, guided, rpa, 2, 0, is, an, emerging, field, within, bpa, and, uses, ai, bpas, can, be, implemented, in, a, number, of, business, areas, including, marketing, sales, and, workflow, home, automation, also, called, domotics, designates, an, emerging, practice, of, increased, automation, of, household, appliances, and, features, in, residential, dwellings, particularly, through, electronic, means, that, allow, for, things, impracticable, overly, expensive, or, simply, not, possible, in, recent, past, decades, the, rise, in, the, usage, of, home, automation, solutions, has, taken, a, turn, reflecting, the, increased, dependency, of, people, on, such, automation, solutions, however, the, increased, comfort, that, gets, added, through, these, automation, solutions, is, remarkable, automation, is, essential, for, many, scientific, and, clinical, applications, therefore, automation, has, been, extensively, employed, in, laboratories, from, as, early, as, 1980, fully, automated, laboratories, have, already, been, working, however, automation, has, not, become, widespread, in, laboratories, due, to, its, high, cost, this, may, change, with, the, ability, of, integrating, low, cost, devices, with, standard, laboratory, equipment, autosamplers, are, common, devices, used, in, laboratory, automation, logistics, automation, is, the, application, of, computer, software, or, automated, machinery, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, logistics, operations, typically, this, refers, to, operations, within, a, warehouse, or, distribution, center, with, broader, tasks, undertaken, by, supply, chain, engineering, systems, and, enterprise, resource, planning, systems, industrial, automation, deals, primarily, with, the, automation, of, manufacturing, quality, control, and, material, handling, processes, general, purpose, controllers, for, industrial, processes, include, programmable, logic, controllers, stand, alone, i, o, modules, and, computers, industrial, automation, is, to, replace, the, human, action, and, manual, command, response, activities, with, the, use, of, mechanized, equipment, and, logical, programming, commands, one, trend, is, increased, use, of, machine, vision, to, provide, automatic, inspection, and, robot, guidance, functions, another, is, a, continuing, increase, in, the, use, of, robots, industrial, automation, is, simply, required, in, industries, the, rise, of, industrial, automation, is, directly, tied, to, the, fourth, industrial, revolution, which, is, better, known, now, as, industry, 4, 0, originating, from, germany, industry, 4, 0, encompasses, numerous, devices, concepts, and, machines, as, well, as, the, advancement, of, the, industrial, internet, of, things, iiot, an, internet, of, things, is, a, seamless, integration, of, diverse, physical, objects, in, the, internet, through, a, virtual, representation, these, new, revolutionary, advancements, have, drawn, attention, to, the, world, of, automation, in, an, entirely, new, light, and, shown, ways, for, it, to, grow, to, increase, productivity, and, efficiency, in, machinery, and, manufacturing, facilities, industry, 4, 0, works, with, the, iiot, and, software, hardware, to, connect, in, a, way, that, through, communication, technologies, add, enhancements, and, improve, manufacturing, processes, being, able, to, create, smarter, safer, and, more, advanced, manufacturing, is, now, possible, with, these, new, technologies, it, opens, up, a, manufacturing, platform, that, is, more, reliable, consistent, and, efficient, than, before, implementation, of, systems, such, as, scada, is, an, example, of, software, that, takes, place, in, industrial, automation, today, scada, is, a, supervisory, data, collection, software, just, one, of, the, many, used, in, industrial, automation, industry, 4, 0, vastly, covers, many, areas, in, manufacturing, and, will, continue, to, do, so, as, time, goes, on, industrial, robotics, is, a, sub, branch, in, industrial, automation, that, aids, in, various, manufacturing, processes, such, manufacturing, processes, include, machining, welding, painting, assembling, and, material, handling, to, name, a, few, industrial, robots, use, various, mechanical, electrical, as, well, as, software, systems, to, allow, for, high, precision, accuracy, and, speed, that, far, exceed, any, human, performance, the, birth, of, industrial, robots, came, shortly, after, world, war, ii, as, the, u, s, saw, the, need, for, a, quicker, way, to, produce, industrial, and, consumer, goods, servos, digital, logic, and, solid, state, electronics, allowed, engineers, to, build, better, and, faster, systems, and, over, time, these, systems, were, improved, and, revised, to, the, point, where, a, single, robot, is, capable, of, running, 24, hours, a, day, with, little, or, no, maintenance, in, 1997, there, were, 700, 000, industrial, robots, in, use, the, number, has, risen, to, 1, 8m, in, 2017, in, recent, years, ai, with, robotics, is, also, used, in, creating, an, automatic, labeling, solution, using, robotic, arms, as, the, automatic, label, applicator, and, ai, for, learning, and, detecting, the, products, to, be, labelled, industrial, automation, incorporates, programmable, logic, controllers, in, the, manufacturing, process, programmable, logic, controllers, plcs, use, a, processing, system, which, allows, for, variation, of, controls, of, inputs, and, outputs, using, simple, programming, plcs, make, use, of, programmable, memory, storing, instructions, and, functions, like, logic, sequencing, timing, counting, etc, using, a, logic, based, language, a, plc, can, receive, a, variety, of, inputs, and, return, a, variety, of, logical, outputs, the, input, devices, being, sensors, and, output, devices, being, motors, valves, etc, plcs, are, similar, to, computers, however, while, computers, are, optimized, for, calculations, plcs, are, optimized, for, control, tasks, and, use, in, industrial, environments, they, are, built, so, that, only, basic, logic, based, programming, knowledge, is, needed, and, to, handle, vibrations, high, temperatures, humidity, and, noise, the, greatest, advantage, plcs, offer, is, their, flexibility, with, the, same, basic, controllers, a, plc, can, operate, a, range, of, different, control, systems, plcs, make, it, unnecessary, to, rewire, a, system, to, change, the, control, system, this, flexibility, leads, to, a, cost, effective, system, for, complex, and, varied, control, systems, plcs, can, range, from, small, building, brick, devices, with, tens, of, i, o, in, a, housing, integral, with, the, processor, to, large, rack, mounted, modular, devices, with, a, count, of, thousands, of, i, o, and, which, are, often, networked, to, other, plc, and, scada, systems, they, can, be, designed, for, multiple, arrangements, of, digital, and, analog, inputs, and, outputs, i, o, extended, temperature, ranges, immunity, to, electrical, noise, and, resistance, to, vibration, and, impact, programs, to, control, machine, operation, are, typically, stored, in, battery, backed, up, or, non, volatile, memory, it, was, from, the, automotive, industry, in, the, united, states, that, the, plc, was, born, before, the, plc, control, sequencing, and, safety, interlock, logic, for, manufacturing, automobiles, was, mainly, composed, of, relays, cam, timers, drum, sequencers, and, dedicated, closed, loop, controllers, since, these, could, number, in, the, hundreds, or, even, thousands, the, process, for, updating, such, facilities, for, the, yearly, model, change, over, was, very, time, consuming, and, expensive, as, electricians, needed, to, individually, rewire, the, relays, to, change, their, operational, characteristics, when, digital, computers, became, available, being, general, purpose, programmable, devices, they, were, soon, applied, to, control, sequential, and, combinatorial, logic, in, industrial, processes, however, these, early, computers, required, specialist, programmers, and, stringent, operating, environmental, control, for, temperature, cleanliness, and, power, quality, to, meet, these, challenges, the, plc, was, developed, with, several, key, attributes, it, would, tolerate, the, shop, floor, environment, it, would, support, discrete, bit, form, input, and, output, in, an, easily, extensible, manner, it, would, not, require, years, of, training, to, use, and, it, would, permit, its, operation, to, be, monitored, since, many, industrial, processes, have, timescales, easily, addressed, by, millisecond, response, times, modern, fast, small, reliable, electronics, greatly, facilitate, building, reliable, controllers, and, performance, could, be, traded, off, for, reliability, agent, assisted, automation, refers, to, automation, used, by, call, center, agents, to, handle, customer, inquiries, the, key, benefit, of, agent, assisted, automation, is, compliance, and, error, proofing, agents, are, sometimes, not, fully, trained, or, they, forget, or, ignore, key, steps, in, the, process, the, use, of, automation, ensures, that, what, is, supposed, to, happen, on, the, call, actually, does, every, time, there, are, two, basic, types, desktop, automation, and, automated, voice, solutions, fundamentally, there, are, two, types, of, control, loop, open, loop, control, feedforward, and, closed, loop, control, feedback, in, open, loop, control, the, control, action, from, the, controller, is, independent, of, the, process, output, or, controlled, process, variable, a, good, example, of, this, is, a, central, heating, boiler, controlled, only, by, a, timer, so, that, heat, is, applied, for, a, constant, time, regardless, of, the, temperature, of, the, building, the, control, action, is, the, switching, on, off, of, the, boiler, but, the, controlled, variable, should, be, the, building, temperature, but, is, not, because, this, is, open, loop, control, of, the, boiler, which, does, not, give, closed, loop, control, of, the, temperature, in, closed, loop, control, the, control, action, from, the, controller, is, dependent, on, the, process, output, in, the, case, of, the, boiler, analogy, this, would, include, a, thermostat, to, monitor, the, building, temperature, and, thereby, feed, back, a, signal, to, ensure, the, controller, maintains, the, building, at, the, temperature, set, on, the, thermostat, a, closed, loop, controller, therefore, has, a, feedback, loop, which, ensures, the, controller, exerts, a, control, action, to, give, a, process, output, the, same, as, the, reference, input, or, set, point, for, this, reason, closed, loop, controllers, are, also, called, feedback, controllers, the, definition, of, a, closed, loop, control, system, according, to, the, british, standards, institution, is, a, control, system, possessing, monitoring, feedback, the, deviation, signal, formed, as, a, result, of, this, feedback, being, used, to, control, the, action, of, a, final, control, element, in, such, a, way, as, to, tend, to, reduce, the, deviation, to, zero, one, of, the, simplest, types, of, control, is, on, off, control, an, example, is, a, thermostat, used, on, household, appliances, which, either, open, or, close, an, electrical, contact, thermostats, were, originally, developed, as, true, feedback, control, mechanisms, rather, than, the, on, off, common, household, appliance, thermostat, sequence, control, in, which, a, programmed, sequence, of, discrete, operations, is, performed, often, based, on, system, logic, that, involves, system, states, an, elevator, control, system, is, an, example, of, sequence, control, a, proportional, integral, derivative, controller, pid, controller, is, a, control, loop, feedback, mechanism, controller, widely, used, in, industrial, control, systems, in, a, pid, loop, the, controller, continuously, calculates, an, error, value, e, t, displaystyle, e, t, as, the, difference, between, a, desired, setpoint, and, a, measured, process, variable, and, applies, a, correction, based, on, proportional, integral, and, derivative, terms, respectively, sometimes, denoted, p, i, and, d, which, give, their, name, to, the, controller, type, the, theoretical, understanding, and, application, date, from, the, 1920s, and, they, are, implemented, in, nearly, all, analog, control, systems, originally, in, mechanical, controllers, and, then, using, discrete, electronics, and, latterly, in, industrial, process, computers, sequential, control, may, be, either, to, a, fixed, sequence, or, to, a, logical, one, that, will, perform, different, actions, depending, on, various, system, states, an, example, of, an, adjustable, but, otherwise, fixed, sequence, is, a, timer, on, a, lawn, sprinkler, states, refer, to, the, various, conditions, that, can, occur, in, a, use, or, sequence, scenario, of, the, system, an, example, is, an, elevator, which, uses, logic, based, on, the, system, state, to, perform, certain, actions, in, response, to, its, state, and, operator, input, for, example, if, the, operator, presses, the, floor, n, button, the, system, will, respond, depending, on, whether, the, elevator, is, stopped, or, moving, going, up, or, down, or, if, the, door, is, open, or, closed, and, other, conditions, early, development, of, sequential, control, was, relay, logic, by, which, electrical, relays, engage, electrical, contacts, which, either, start, or, interrupt, power, to, a, device, relays, were, first, used, in, telegraph, networks, before, being, developed, for, controlling, other, devices, such, as, when, starting, and, stopping, industrial, sized, electric, motors, or, opening, and, closing, solenoid, valves, using, relays, for, control, purposes, allowed, event, driven, control, where, actions, could, be, triggered, out, of, sequence, in, response, to, external, events, these, were, more, flexible, in, their, response, than, the, rigid, single, sequence, cam, timers, more, complicated, examples, involved, maintaining, safe, sequences, for, devices, such, as, swing, bridge, controls, where, a, lock, bolt, needed, to, be, disengaged, before, the, bridge, could, be, moved, and, the, lock, bolt, could, not, be, released, until, the, safety, gates, had, already, been, closed, the, total, number, of, relays, and, cam, timers, can, number, into, the, hundreds, or, even, thousands, in, some, factories, early, programming, techniques, and, languages, were, needed, to, make, such, systems, manageable, one, of, the, first, being, ladder, logic, where, diagrams, of, the, interconnected, relays, resembled, the, rungs, of, a, ladder, special, computers, called, programmable, logic, controllers, were, later, designed, to, replace, these, collections, of, hardware, with, a, single, more, easily, re, programmed, unit, in, a, typical, hard, wired, motor, start, and, stop, circuit, called, a, control, circuit, a, motor, is, started, by, pushing, a, start, or, run, button, that, activates, a, pair, of, electrical, relays, the, lock, in, relay, locks, in, contacts, that, keep, the, control, circuit, energized, when, the, push, button, is, released, the, start, button, is, a, normally, open, contact, and, the, stop, button, is, a, normally, closed, contact, another, relay, energizes, a, switch, that, powers, the, device, that, throws, the, motor, starter, switch, three, sets, of, contacts, for, three, phase, industrial, power, in, the, main, power, circuit, large, motors, use, high, voltage, and, experience, high, in, rush, current, making, speed, important, in, making, and, breaking, contact, this, can, be, dangerous, for, personnel, and, property, with, manual, switches, the, lock, in, contacts, in, the, start, circuit, and, the, main, power, contacts, for, the, motor, are, held, engaged, by, their, respective, electromagnets, until, a, stop, or, off, button, is, pressed, which, de, energizes, the, lock, in, relay, commonly, interlocks, are, added, to, a, control, circuit, suppose, that, the, motor, in, the, example, is, powering, machinery, that, has, a, critical, need, for, lubrication, in, this, case, an, interlock, could, be, added, to, ensure, that, the, oil, pump, is, running, before, the, motor, starts, timers, limit, switches, and, electric, eyes, are, other, common, elements, in, control, circuits, solenoid, valves, are, widely, used, on, compressed, air, or, hydraulic, fluid, for, powering, actuators, on, mechanical, components, while, motors, are, used, to, supply, continuous, rotary, motion, actuators, are, typically, a, better, choice, for, intermittently, creating, a, limited, range, of, movement, for, a, mechanical, component, such, as, moving, various, mechanical, arms, opening, or, closing, valves, raising, heavy, press, rolls, applying, pressure, to, presses, computers, can, perform, both, sequential, control, and, feedback, control, and, typically, a, single, computer, will, do, both, in, an, industrial, application, programmable, logic, controllers, plcs, are, a, type, of, special, purpose, microprocessor, that, replaced, many, hardware, components, such, as, timers, and, drum, sequencers, used, in, relay, logic, type, systems, general, purpose, process, control, computers, have, increasingly, replaced, stand, alone, controllers, with, a, single, computer, able, to, perform, the, operations, of, hundreds, of, controllers, process, control, computers, can, process, data, from, a, network, of, plcs, instruments, and, controllers, to, implement, typical, such, as, pid, control, of, many, individual, variables, or, in, some, cases, to, implement, complex, control, algorithms, using, multiple, inputs, and, mathematical, manipulations, they, can, also, analyze, data, and, create, real, time, graphical, displays, for, operators, and, run, reports, for, operators, engineers, and, management, control, of, an, automated, teller, machine, atm, is, an, example, of, an, interactive, process, in, which, a, computer, will, perform, a, logic, derived, response, to, a, user, selection, based, on, information, retrieved, from, a, networked, database, the, atm, process, has, similarities, with, other, online, transaction, processes, the, different, logical, responses, are, called, scenarios, such, processes, are, typically, designed, with, the, aid, of, use, cases, and, flowcharts, which, guide, the, writing, of, the, software, code, the, earliest, feedback, control, mechanism, was, the, water, clock, invented, by, greek, engineer, ctesibius, 285, 222, bc
