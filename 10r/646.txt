crochet, english, k, r, o, e, french, is, a, process, of, creating, textiles, by, using, a, crochet, hook, to, interlock, loops, of, yarn, thread, or, strands, of, other, materials, the, name, is, derived, from, the, french, term, croc, which, means, hook, hooks, can, be, made, from, a, variety, of, materials, such, as, metal, wood, bamboo, bone, or, even, plastic, the, key, difference, between, crochet, and, knitting, beyond, the, implements, used, for, their, production, is, that, each, stitch, in, crochet, is, completed, before, the, next, one, is, begun, while, knitting, keeps, many, stitches, open, at, a, time, some, variant, forms, of, crochet, such, as, tunisian, crochet, and, broomstick, lace, do, keep, multiple, crochet, stitches, open, at, a, time, the, word, crochet, is, derived, from, the, french, word, crochet, a, diminutive, of, croche, in, turn, from, the, germanic, croc, both, meaning, hook, it, was, used, in, 17th, century, french, lace, making, where, the, term, crochetage, designated, a, stitch, used, to, join, separate, pieces, of, lace, the, word, crochet, subsequently, came, to, describe, both, the, specific, type, of, textile, and, the, hooked, needle, used, to, produce, it, in, 1567, the, tailor, of, mary, queen, of, scots, jehan, de, compiegne, supplied, her, with, silk, thread, for, sewing, and, crochet, soye, coudre, et, crochetz, knitted, textiles, survive, from, as, early, as, the, 11th, century, ce, but, the, first, substantive, evidence, of, crocheted, fabric, emerges, in, europe, during, the, 19th, century, earlier, work, identified, as, crochet, was, commonly, made, by, n, lebinding, a, different, looped, yarn, technique, the, first, known, published, instructions, for, crochet, explicitly, using, that, term, to, describe, the, craft, in, its, present, sense, appeared, in, the, dutch, magazine, pen, lop, in, 1823, this, includes, a, colour, plate, showing, five, styles, of, purse, of, which, three, were, intended, to, be, crocheted, with, silk, thread, the, first, is, simple, open, crochet, crochet, simple, ajour, a, mesh, of, chain, stitch, arches, the, second, illustrated, here, starts, in, a, semi, open, form, demi, jour, where, chain, stitch, arches, alternate, with, equally, long, segments, of, slip, stitch, crochet, and, closes, with, a, star, made, with, double, crochet, stitches, dubbelde, hekelsteek, double, crochet, in, british, terminology, single, crochet, in, us, the, third, purse, is, made, entirely, in, double, crochet, the, instructions, prescribe, the, use, of, a, tambour, needle, as, illustrated, below, and, introduce, a, number, of, decorative, techniques, the, earliest, dated, reference, in, english, to, garments, made, of, cloth, produced, by, looping, yarn, with, a, hook, shepherd, s, knitting, is, in, the, memoirs, of, a, highland, lady, by, elizabeth, grant, 1797, 1830, the, journal, entry, itself, is, dated, 1812, but, was, not, recorded, in, its, subsequently, published, form, until, some, time, between, 1845, and, 1867, and, the, actual, date, of, publication, was, first, in, 1898, nonetheless, the, 1833, volume, of, pen, lop, describes, and, illustrates, a, shepherd, s, hook, and, recommends, its, use, for, crochet, with, coarser, yarn, in, 1844, one, of, the, numerous, books, discussing, crochet, that, began, to, appear, in, the, 1840s, states, crochet, needles, sometimes, called, shepherds, hooks, are, made, of, steel, ivory, or, box, wood, they, have, a, hook, at, one, end, similar, in, shape, to, a, fish, hook, by, which, the, wool, or, silk, is, caught, and, drawn, through, the, work, these, instruments, are, to, be, procured, of, various, sizes, two, years, later, the, same, author, writes, crochet, a, species, of, knitting, originally, practised, by, the, peasants, in, scotland, with, a, small, hooked, needle, called, a, shepherd, s, hook, has, within, the, last, seven, years, aided, by, taste, and, fashion, obtained, the, preference, over, all, other, ornamental, works, of, a, similar, nature, it, derives, its, present, name, from, the, french, the, instrument, with, which, it, is, worked, being, by, them, from, its, crooked, shape, termed, crochet, this, art, has, attained, its, highest, degree, of, perfection, in, england, whence, it, has, been, transplanted, to, france, and, germany, and, both, countries, although, unjustifiably, have, claimed, the, invention, an, instruction, book, from, 1846, describes, shepherd, or, single, crochet, as, what, in, current, international, terminology, is, either, called, single, crochet, or, slip, stitch, crochet, with, u, s, terminology, always, using, the, latter, reserving, single, crochet, for, use, as, noted, above, it, similarly, equates, double, and, french, crochet, notwithstanding, the, categorical, assertion, of, a, purely, british, origin, there, is, solid, evidence, of, a, connection, between, french, tambour, embroidery, and, crochet, french, tambour, embroidery, was, illustrated, in, detail, in, 1763, in, diderot, s, encyclopedia, the, tip, of, the, needle, shown, there, is, indistinguishable, from, that, of, a, present, day, inline, crochet, hook, and, the, chain, stitch, separated, from, a, cloth, support, is, a, fundamental, element, of, the, latter, technique, the, 1823, pen, lop, instructions, unequivocally, state, that, the, tambour, tool, was, used, for, crochet, and, the, first, of, the, 1840s, instruction, books, uses, the, terms, tambour, and, crochet, as, synonyms, this, equivalence, is, retained, in, the, 4th, edition, of, that, work, 1847, the, strong, taper, of, the, shepherd, s, hook, eases, the, production, of, slip, stitch, crochet, but, is, less, amenable, to, stitches, that, require, multiple, loops, on, the, hook, at, the, same, time, early, yarn, hooks, were, also, continuously, tapered, but, gradually, enough, to, accommodate, multiple, loops, the, design, with, a, cylindrical, shaft, that, is, commonplace, today, was, largely, reserved, for, tambour, style, steel, needles, both, types, gradually, merged, into, the, modern, form, that, appeared, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, including, both, tapered, and, cylindrical, segments, and, the, continuously, tapered, bone, hook, remained, in, industrial, production, until, world, war, ii, the, early, instruction, books, make, frequent, reference, to, the, alternative, use, of, ivory, bone, or, wooden, hooks, and, steel, needles, in, a, handle, as, appropriate, to, the, stitch, being, made, taken, with, the, synonymous, labeling, of, shepherd, s, and, single, crochet, and, the, similar, equivalence, of, french, and, double, crochet, there, is, a, strong, suggestion, that, crochet, is, rooted, both, in, tambour, embroidery, and, shepherd, s, knitting, leading, to, thread, and, yarn, crochet, respectively, a, distinction, that, is, still, made, the, locus, of, the, fusion, of, all, these, elements, the, invention, noted, above, has, yet, to, be, determined, as, does, the, origin, of, shepherd, s, knitting, shepherd, s, hooks, are, still, being, made, for, local, slip, stitch, crochet, traditions, the, form, in, the, accompanying, photograph, is, typical, for, contemporary, production, a, longer, continuously, tapering, design, intermediate, between, it, and, the, 19th, century, tapered, hook, was, also, in, earlier, production, commonly, being, made, from, the, handles, of, forks, and, spoons, in, the, 19th, century, as, ireland, was, facing, the, great, irish, famine, 1845, 1849, crochet, lace, work, was, introduced, as, a, form, of, famine, relief, the, production, of, crocheted, lace, being, an, alternative, way, of, making, money, for, impoverished, irish, workers, men, women, children, joined, a, co, operative, in, order, to, crochet, and, produce, products, to, help, with, famine, relief, during, the, great, irish, famine, schools, to, teach, crocheting, were, started, teachers, were, trained, and, sent, across, ireland, to, teach, this, craft, when, the, irish, immigrated, to, the, americas, they, were, able, to, take, with, them, crocheting, mademoiselle, riego, de, la, branchardiere, is, generally, credited, with, the, invention, of, irish, crochet, publishing, the, first, book, of, patterns, in, 1846, irish, lace, became, popular, in, europe, and, america, and, was, made, in, quantity, until, the, first, world, war, fashions, in, crochet, changed, with, the, end, of, the, victorian, era, in, the, 1890s, crocheted, laces, in, the, new, edwardian, era, peaking, between, 1910, and, 1920, became, even, more, elaborate, in, texture, and, complicated, stitching, the, strong, victorian, colours, disappeared, though, and, new, publications, called, for, white, or, pale, threads, except, for, fancy, purses, which, were, often, crocheted, of, brightly, colored, silk, and, elaborately, beaded, after, world, war, i, far, fewer, crochet, patterns, were, published, and, most, of, them, were, simplified, versions, of, the, early, 20th, century, patterns, after, world, war, ii, from, the, late, 1940s, until, the, early, 1960s, there, was, a, resurgence, in, interest, in, home, crafts, particularly, in, the, united, states, with, many, new, and, imaginative, crochet, designs, published, for, colorful, doilies, potholders, and, other, home, items, along, with, updates, of, earlier, publications, these, patterns, called, for, thicker, threads, and, yarns, than, in, earlier, patterns, and, included, variegated, colors, the, craft, remained, primarily, a, homemaker, s, art, until, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, when, the, new, generation, picked, up, on, crochet, and, popularized, granny, squares, a, motif, worked, in, the, round, and, incorporating, bright, colors, although, crochet, underwent, a, subsequent, decline, in, popularity, the, early, 21st, century, has, seen, a, revival, of, interest, in, handcrafts, and, diy, as, well, as, improvement, of, the, quality, and, varieties, of, yarn, as, well, as, books, and, classes, there, are, youtube, tutorials, and, tiktok, videos, to, help, people, who, may, need, a, clearer, explanation, to, learn, how, to, crochet, filet, crochet, tunisian, crochet, tapestry, crochet, broomstick, lace, hairpin, lace, cro, hooking, and, irish, crochet, are, all, variants, of, the, basic, crochet, method, crochet, has, experienced, a, revival, on, the, catwalk, as, well, christopher, kane, s, fall, 2011, ready, to, wear, collection, makes, intensive, use, of, the, granny, square, one, of, the, most, basic, of, crochet, motifs, in, addition, crochet, has, been, utilized, many, times, by, designers, on, the, reality, show, project, runway, websites, such, as, etsy, and, ravelry, have, made, it, easier, for, individual, hobbyists, to, sell, and, distribute, their, patterns, or, projects, across, the, internet, creating, crocheted, items, has, become, a, way, to, make, sustainable, fashion, fast, fashion, brands, like, shein, have, created, products, that, resemble, crocheted, items, basic, materials, required, for, crochet, are, hook, scissors, to, cut, yarn, and, some, type, of, material, that, will, be, crocheted, most, commonly, used, are, yarn, or, thread, yarn, one, of, the, most, commonly, used, materials, for, crocheting, has, varying, weights, which, need, to, be, taken, into, consideration, when, following, patterns, the, weight, of, the, yarn, can, affect, not, only, the, look, of, the, product, but, also, the, feeling, acrylic, can, also, be, used, when, crocheting, as, it, is, synthetic, and, an, alternative, for, wool, additional, tools, are, convenient, for, making, related, accessories, examples, of, such, tools, include, cardboard, cutouts, which, can, be, used, to, make, tassels, fringe, and, many, other, items, a, pom, pom, circle, used, to, make, pom, poms, a, tape, measure, and, a, gauge, measure, both, used, for, measuring, crocheted, work, and, counting, stitches, a, row, counter, and, occasionally, plastic, rings, which, are, used, for, special, projects, in, recent, years, yarn, selections, have, moved, beyond, synthetic, and, plant, and, animal, based, fibers, to, include, bamboo, qiviut, hemp, and, banana, stalks, to, name, a, few, many, advanced, crocheters, have, also, incorporated, recycled, materials, into, their, work, in, an, effort, to, go, green, and, experiment, with, new, textures, by, using, items, such, as, plastic, bags, old, t, shirts, or, sheets, vcr, or, cassette, tape, and, ribbon, the, crochet, hook, comes, in, many, sizes, and, materials, because, sizing, is, categorized, by, the, diameter, of, the, hook, s, shaft, a, crafter, aims, to, create, stitches, of, a, certain, size, in, order, to, reach, a, particular, gauge, specified, in, a, given, pattern, if, gauge, is, not, reached, with, one, hook, another, is, used, until, the, stitches, made, are, the, needed, size, crafters, may, have, a, preference, for, one, type, of, hook, material, over, another, due, to, aesthetic, appeal, yarn, glide, or, hand, disorders, such, as, arthritis, where, bamboo, or, wood, hooks, are, favored, over, metal, for, the, perceived, warmth, and, flexibility, during, use, hook, grips, and, ergonomic, hook, handles, are, also, available, to, assist, crafters, steel, crochet, hooks, range, in, size, from, 0, 4, to, 3, 5, millimeters, or, from, 00, to, 16, in, american, sizing, these, hooks, are, used, for, fine, crochet, work, such, as, doilies, and, lace, aluminium, bamboo, and, plastic, crochet, hooks, are, available, from, 2, 5, to, 19, millimeters, in, size, or, from, b, to, s, in, american, sizing, artisan, made, hooks, are, often, made, of, hand, turned, woods, sometimes, decorated, with, semi, precious, stones, or, beads, crochet, hooks, used, for, tunisian, crochet, are, elongated, and, have, a, stopper, at, the, end, of, the, handle, while, double, ended, crochet, hooks, have, a, hook, on, both, ends, of, the, handle, there, is, also, a, double, hooked, apparatus, called, a, cro, hook, that, has, become, popular, while, this, is, not, in, itself, a, hook, it, is, a, device, used, in, conjunction, with, a, crochet, hook, to, produce, stitches, yarn, for, crochet, is, usually, sold, as, balls, or, skeins, hanks, although, it, may, also, be, wound, on, spools, or, cones, skeins, and, balls, are, generally, sold, with, a, yarn, band, a, label, that, describes, the, yarn, s, weight, length, dye, lot, fiber, content, washing, instructions, suggested, needle, size, likely, gauge, etc, it, is, a, common, practice, to, save, the, yarn, band, for, future, reference, especially, if, additional, skeins, must, be, purchased, crocheters, generally, ensure, that, the, yarn, for, a, project, comes, from, a, single, dye, lot, the, dye, lot, specifies, a, group, of, skeins, that, were, dyed, together, and, thus, have, precisely, the, same, color, skeins, from, different, dye, lots, even, if, very, similar, in, color, are, usually, slightly, different, and, may, produce, a, visible, stripe, when, added, onto, existing, work, if, insufficient, yarn, of, a, single, dye, lot, is, bought, to, complete, a, project, additional, skeins, of, the, same, dye, lot, can, sometimes, be, obtained, from, other, yarn, stores, or, online, the, thickness, or, weight, of, the, yarn, is, a, significant, factor, in, determining, how, many, stitches, and, rows, are, required, to, cover, a, given, area, for, a, given, stitch, pattern, this, is, also, termed, the, gauge, thicker, yarns, generally, require, large, diameter, crochet, hooks, whereas, thinner, yarns, may, be, crocheted, with, thick, or, thin, hooks, hence, thicker, yarns, generally, require, fewer, stitches, and, therefore, less, time, to, work, up, a, given, project, the, recommended, gauge, for, a, given, ball, of, yarn, can, be, found, on, the, label, that, surrounds, the, skein, when, buying, in, stores, patterns, and, motifs, are, coarser, with, thicker, yarns, and, produce, bold, visual, effects, whereas, thinner, yarns, are, best, for, refined, or, delicate, pattern, work, yarns, are, standardly, grouped, by, thickness, into, six, categories, superfine, fine, light, medium, bulky, and, superbulky, quantitatively, thickness, is, measured, by, the, number, of, wraps, per, inch, wpi, the, related, weight, per, unit, length, is, usually, measured, in, tex, or, denier, before, use, hanks, are, wound, into, balls, in, which, the, yarn, emerges, from, the, center, making, crocheting, easier, by, preventing, the, yarn, from, becoming, easily, tangled, the, winding, process, may, be, performed, by, hand, or, done, with, a, ball, winder, and, swift, a, yarn, s, usefulness, is, judged, by, several, factors, such, as, its, loft, its, ability, to, trap, air, its, resilience, elasticity, under, tension, its, washability, and, colorfastness, its, hand, its, feel, particularly, softness, vs, scratchiness, its, durability, against, abrasion, its, resistance, to, pilling, its, hairiness, fuzziness, its, tendency, to, twist, or, untwist, its, overall, weight, and, drape, its, blocking, and, felting, qualities, its, comfort, breathability, moisture, absorption, wicking, properties, and, its, appearance, which, includes, its, color, sheen, smoothness, and, ornamental, features, other, factors, include, allergenicity, speed, of, drying, resistance, to, chemicals, moths, and, mildew, melting, point, and, flammability, retention, of, static, electricity, and, the, propensity, to, accept, dyes, desirable, properties, may, vary, for, different, projects, so, there, is, no, one, best, yarn, although, crochet, may, be, done, with, ribbons, metal, wire, or, more, exotic, filaments, most, yarns, are, made, by, spinning, fibers, in, spinning, the, fibers, are, twisted, so, that, the, yarn, resists, breaking, under, tension, the, twisting, may, be, done, in, either, direction, resulting, in, a, z, twist, or, s, twist, yarn, if, the, fibers, are, first, aligned, by, combing, them, and, the, spinner, uses, a, worsted, type, drafting, method, such, as, the, short, forward, draw, the, yarn, is, smoother, and, called, a, worsted, by, contrast, if, the, fibers, are, carded, but, not, combed, and, the, spinner, uses, a, woolen, drafting, method, such, as, the, long, backward, draw, the, yarn, is, fuzzier, and, called, woolen, spun, the, fibers, making, up, a, yarn, may, be, continuous, filament, fibers, such, as, silk, and, many, synthetics, or, they, may, be, staples, fibers, of, an, average, length, typically, a, few, inches, naturally, filament, fibers, are, sometimes, cut, up, into, staples, before, spinning, the, strength, of, the, spun, yarn, against, breaking, is, determined, by, the, amount, of, twist, the, length, of, the, fibers, and, the, thickness, of, the, yarn, in, general, yarns, become, stronger, with, more, twist, also, called, worst, longer, fibers, and, thicker, yarns, more, fibers, for, example, thinner, yarns, require, more, twist, than, do, thicker, yarns, to, resist, breaking, under, tension, the, thickness, of, the, yarn, may, vary, along, its, length, a, slub, is, a, much, thicker, section, in, which, a, mass, of, fibers, is, incorporated, into, the, yarn, the, spun, fibers, are, generally, divided, into, animal, fibers, plant, and, synthetic, fibers, these, fiber, types, are, chemically, different, corresponding, to, proteins, carbohydrates, and, synthetic, polymers, respectively, animal, fibers, include, silk, but, generally, are, long, hairs, of, animals, such, as, sheep, wool, goat, angora, or, cashmere, goat, rabbit, angora, llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and, muskox, qiviut, plants, used, for, fibers, include, cotton, flax, for, linen, bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, raffia, yucca, coconut, husk, banana, trees, soy, and, corn, rayon, and, acetate, fibers, are, also, produced, from, cellulose, mainly, derived, from, trees, common, synthetic, fibers, include, acrylics, polyesters, such, as, dacron, and, ingeo, nylon, and, other, polyamides, and, olefins, such, as, polypropylene, of, these, types, wool, is, generally, favored, for, crochet, chiefly, owing, to, its, superior, elasticity, warmth, and, sometimes, felting, however, wool, is, generally, less, convenient, to, clean, and, some, people, are, allergic, to, it, it, is, also, common, to, blend, different, fibers, in, the, yarn, e, g, 85, alpaca, and, 15, silk, even, within, a, type, of, fiber, there, can, be, great, variety, in, the, length, and, thickness, of, the, fibers, for, example, merino, wool, and, egyptian, cotton, are, favored, because, they, produce, exceptionally, long, thin, fine, fibers, for, their, type, a, single, spun, yarn, may, be, crochet, as, is, or, braided, or, plied, with, another, in, plying, two, or, more, yarns, are, spun, together, almost, always, in, the, opposite, sense, from, which, they, were, spun, individually, for, example, two, z, twist, yarns, are, usually, plied, with, an, s, twist, the, opposing, twist, relieves, some, of, the, yarns, tendency, to, curl, up, and, produces, a, thicker, balanced, yarn, plied, yarns, may, themselves, be, plied, together, producing, cabled, yarns, or, multi, stranded, yarns, sometimes, the, yarns, being, plied, are, fed, at, different, rates, so, that, one, yarn, loops, around, the, other, as, in, boucl, the, single, yarns, may, be, dyed, separately, before, plying, or, afterwards, to, give, the, yarn, a, uniform, look, the, dyeing, of, yarns, is, a, complex, art, yarns, need, not, be, dyed, or, they, may, be, dyed, one, color, or, a, great, variety, of, colors, dyeing, may, be, done, industrially, by, hand, or, even, hand, painted, onto, the, yarn, a, great, variety, of, synthetic, dyes, have, been, developed, since, the, synthesis, of, indigo, dye, in, the, mid, 19th, century, however, natural, dyes, are, also, possible, although, they, are, generally, less, brilliant, the, color, scheme, of, a, yarn, is, sometimes, called, its, colorway, variegated, yarns, can, produce, interesting, visual, effects, such, as, diagonal, stripes, crocheted, fabric, is, begun, by, placing, a, slip, knot, loop, on, the, hook, though, other, methods, such, as, a, magic, ring, or, simple, folding, over, of, the, yarn, may, be, used, pulling, another, loop, through, the, first, loop, and, repeating, this, process, to, create, a, chain, of, a, suitable, length, the, chain, is, either, turned, and, worked, in, rows, or, joined, to, the, beginning, of, the, row, with, a, slip, stitch, and, worked, in, rounds, rounds, can, also, be, created, by, working, many, stitches, into, a, single, loop, stitches, are, made, by, pulling, one, or, more, loops, through, each, loop, of, the, chain, at, any, one, time, at, the, end, of, a, stitch, there, is, only, one, loop, left, on, the, hook, tunisian, crochet, however, draws, all, of, the, loops, for, an, entire, row, onto, a, long, hook, before, working, them, off, one, at, a, time, like, knitting, crochet, can, be, worked, either, flat, back, and, forth, in, rows, or, in, the, round, in, spirals, such, as, when, making, tubular, pieces, there, are, six, main, types, of, basic, stitches, the, following, description, uses, international, crochet, terminology, with, us, variants, noted, in, backets, while, the, horizontal, distance, covered, by, these, basic, stitches, is, the, same, they, differ, in, height, and, can, be, replaced, with, a, length, of, ch, when, required, eg, 1, tr, 3, ch, the, more, advanced, stitches, are, often, combinations, of, these, basic, stitches, or, are, made, by, inserting, the, hook, into, the, work, in, unusual, locations, more, advanced, stitches, include, the, shell, stitch, v, stitch, spike, stitch, afghan, stitch, butterfly, stitch, popcorn, stitch, cluster, stitch, and, crocodile, stitch, there, are, two, main, notations, of, basic, stitches, one, used, across, europe, australia, india, and, other, crocheting, nations, the, other, in, the, us, and, canada, in, america, international, terminology, is, often, erroneously, called, british, or, uk, terminology, crochet, is, traditionally, worked, from, a, written, pattern, using, standard, abbreviations, or, from, a, diagram, thus, enabling, non, english, speakers, to, use, english, based, patterns, to, help, counter, confusion, when, reading, patterns, a, diagramming, system, using, a, standard, international, notation, has, come, into, use, illustration, left, in, the, united, states, crochet, terminology, and, sizing, guidelines, as, well, as, standards, for, yarn, and, hook, labeling, are, primarily, regulated, by, the, craft, yarn, council, another, terminological, difference, is, known, as, tension, international, and, gauge, us, individual, crocheters, work, yarn, with, a, loose, or, a, tight, hold, and, if, unmeasured, these, differences, can, lead, to, significant, size, changes, in, finished, garments, that, have, the, same, number, of, stitches, in, order, to, control, for, this, inconsistency, printed, crochet, instructions, include, a, standard, for, the, number, of, stitches, across, a, standard, swatch, of, fabric, an, individual, crocheter, begins, work, by, producing, a, test, swatch, and, compensating, for, any, discrepancy, by, changing, to, a, smaller, or, larger, hook, one, of, the, more, obvious, differences, is, that, crochet, uses, one, hook, while, much, knitting, uses, two, needles, in, most, crochet, the, artisan, usually, has, only, one, live, stitch, on, the, hook, with, the, exception, being, tunisian, crochet, while, a, knitter, keeps, an, entire, row, of, stitches, active, simultaneously, dropped, stitches, which, can, unravel, a, knitted, fabric, rarely, interfere, with, crochet, work, due, to, a, second, structural, difference, between, knitting, and, crochet, in, knitting, each, stitch, is, supported, by, the, corresponding, stitch, in, the, row, above, and, it, supports, the, corresponding, stitch, in, the, row, below, whereas, crochet, stitches, are, only, supported, by, and, support, the, stitches, on, either, side, of, it, if, a, stitch, in, a, finished, crocheted, item, breaks, the, stitches, above, and, below, remain, intact, and, because, of, the, complex, looping, of, each, stitch, the, stitches, on, either, side, are, unlikely, to, come, loose, unless, heavily, stressed, round, or, cylindrical, patterns, are, simple, to, produce, with, a, regular, crochet, hook, but, cylindrical, knitting, requires, either, a, set, of, circular, needles, or, three, to, five, special, double, ended, needles, many, crocheted, items, are, composed, of, individual, motifs, which, are, then, joined, either, by, sewing, or, crocheting, whereas, knitting, is, usually, composed, of, one, fabric, such, as, entrelac, freeform, crochet, is, a, technique, that, can, create, interesting, shapes, in, three, dimensions, because, new, stitches, can, be, made, independently, of, previous, stitches, almost, anywhere, in, the, crocheted, piece, it, is, generally, accomplished, by, building, shapes, or, structural, elements, onto, existing, crocheted, fabric, at, any, place, the, crafter, desires, knitting, can, be, accomplished, by, machine, while, many, crochet, stitches, can, only, be, crafted, by, hand, the, height, of, knitted, and, crocheted, stitches, is, also, different, a, single, crochet, stitch, is, twice, the, height, of, a, knit, stitch, in, the, same, yarn, size, and, comparable, diameter, tools, and, a, double, crochet, stitch, is, about, four, times, the, height, of, a, knit, stitch, while, most, crochet, is, made, with, a, hook, there, is, also, a, method, of, crocheting, with, a, knitting, loom, this, is, called, loomchet, slip, stitch, crochet, is, very, similar, to, knitting, each, stitch, in, slip, stitch, crochet, is, formed, the, same, way, as, a, knit, or, purl, stitch, which, is, then, bound, off, a, person, working, in, slip, stitch, crochet, can, follow, a, knitted, pattern, with, knits, purls, and, cables, and, get, a, similar, result, it, is, a, common, perception, that, crochet, produces, a, thicker, fabric, than, knitting, tends, to, have, less, give, than, knitted, fabric, and, uses, approximately, a, third, more, yarn, for, a, comparable, project, than, knitted, items, although, this, is, true, when, comparing, a, single, crochet, swatch, with, a, stockinette, swatch, both, made, with, the, same, size, yarn, and, needle, hook, it, is, not, necessarily, true, for, crochet, in, general, most, crochet, uses, far, less, than, 1, 3, more, yarn, than, knitting, for, comparable, pieces, and, a, crocheter, can, get, similar, feel, and, drape, to, knitting, by, using, a, larger, hook, or, thinner, yarn, tunisian, crochet, and, slip, stitch, crochet, can, in, some, cases, use, less, yarn, than, knitting, for, comparable, pieces, according, to, sources, claiming, to, have, tested, the, 1, 3, more, yarn, assertion, a, single, crochet, stitch, sc, uses, approximately, the, same, amount, of, yarn, as, knit, garter, stitch, but, more, yarn, than, stockinette, stitch, any, stitch, using, yarnovers, uses, less, yarn, than, single, crochet, to, produce, the, same, amount, of, fabric, cluster, stitches, which, are, in, fact, multiple, stitches, worked, together, will, use, the, most, length, standard, crochet, stitches, like, sc, and, dc, also, produce, a, thicker, fabric, more, like, knit, garter, stitch, this, is, part, of, why, they, use, more, yarn, slip, stitch, can, produce, a, fabric, much, like, stockinette, that, is, thinner, and, therefore, uses, less, yarn, any, yarn, can, be, either, knitted, or, crocheted, provided, needles, or, hooks, of, the, correct, size, are, used, but, the, cord, s, properties, should, be, taken, into, account, for, example, lofty, thick, woolen, yarns, tend, to, function, better, when, knitted, which, does, not, crush, their, airy, structure, while, thin, and, tightly, spun, yarn, helps, to, achieve, the, firm, texture, required, for, amigurumi, crochet, it, has, been, very, common, for, people, and, groups, to, crochet, clothing, and, other, garments, and, then, donate, them, to, soldiers, during, war, people, have, also, crocheted, clothing, and, then, donated, it, to, hospitals, for, sick, patients, and, also, for, newborn, babies, sometimes, groups, will, crochet, for, a, specific, charity, purpose, such, as, crocheting, for, homeless, shelters, nursing, homes, etc, it, is, becoming, increasingly, popular, to, crochet, hats, commonly, referred, to, as, chemo, caps, and, donate, them, to, cancer, treatment, centers, for, those, undergoing, chemotherapy, and, therefore, losing, hair, during, october, pink, hats, and, scarves, are, made, and, proceeds, are, donated, to, breast, cancer, funds, organizations, dedicated, to, using, crochet, as, a, way, to, help, others, include, knots, of, love, crochet, for, cancer, and, soldiers, angels, these, organizations, offer, warm, useful, items, for, people, in, need, in, 2020, people, around, the, world, banded, together, to, help, save, the, wildlife, affected, by, the, australian, bushfires, by, crocheting, kangaroo, pouches, koala, mittens, and, wildlife, nests, this, was, an, international, effort, to, help, during, the, particularly, bad, bushfire, season, which, devastated, local, ecological, systems, a, group, started, in, 2005, to, create, crochet, versions, of, coral, reefs, grew, by, 2022, to, over, 20, 000, contributors, in, what, became, the, crochet, coral, reef, project, to, promote, awareness, of, the, effects, of, global, warming, their, creations, have, been, displayed, in, galleries, and, museums, by, an, estimated, 2, million, people, many, creations, apply, hyperbolic, curved, geometric, shapes, distinguished, from, euclidean, flat, geometry, to, emulate, natural, structures, crochet, has, been, used, to, illustrate, shapes, in, hyperbolic, space, that, are, difficult, to, reproduce, using, other, media, or, are, difficult, to, understand, when, viewed, two, dimensionally, mathematician, daina, taimi, a, first, used, crochet, in, 1997, to, create, strong, durable, models, of, hyperbolic, space, after, finding, paper, models, were, delicate, and, hard, to, create, these, models, enable, one, to, turn, fold, and, otherwise, manipulate, space, to, more, fully, grasp, ideas, such, as, how, a, line, can, appear, curved, in, hyperbolic, space, yet, actually, be, straight, her, work, received, an, exhibition, by, the, institute, for,
