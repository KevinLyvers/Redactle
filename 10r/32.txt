pesticides, are, substances, that, are, used, to, control, pests, they, include, herbicides, insecticides, nematicides, fungicides, and, many, others, see, table, the, most, common, of, these, are, herbicides, which, account, for, approximately, 50, of, all, pesticide, use, globally, most, pesticides, are, used, as, plant, protection, products, also, known, as, crop, protection, products, which, in, general, protect, plants, from, weeds, fungi, or, insects, in, general, a, pesticide, is, a, chemical, or, biological, agent, such, as, a, virus, bacterium, or, fungus, that, deters, incapacitates, kills, or, otherwise, discourages, pests, target, pests, can, include, insects, plant, pathogens, weeds, molluscs, birds, mammals, fish, nematodes, roundworms, and, microbes, that, destroy, property, cause, nuisance, or, spread, disease, or, are, disease, vectors, along, with, these, benefits, pesticides, also, have, drawbacks, such, as, potential, toxicity, to, humans, and, other, species, the, word, pesticide, derives, from, the, latin, pestis, plague, and, caedere, kill, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, has, defined, pesticide, as, pesticides, can, be, classified, by, target, organism, e, g, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, and, pediculicides, see, table, biopesticides, according, to, the, epa, include, microbial, pesticides, biochemical, pesticides, and, plant, incorporated, protectants, pesticides, can, be, classified, into, structural, classes, with, many, structural, classes, developed, for, each, of, the, target, organisms, listed, in, the, table, a, structural, class, is, usually, associated, with, a, single, mode, of, action, whereas, a, mode, of, action, may, encompass, more, than, one, structural, class, the, pesticidal, chemical, active, ingredient, is, mixed, formulated, with, other, components, to, form, the, product, that, is, sold, and, which, is, applied, in, various, ways, pesticides, in, gas, form, are, fumigants, pesticides, can, be, classified, based, upon, their, mode, of, action, which, indicates, the, exact, biological, mechanism, which, the, pesticide, disrupts, the, modes, of, action, are, important, for, resistance, management, and, are, categorized, and, administered, by, the, insecticide, herbicide, and, fungicide, resistance, action, committees, pesticides, may, be, systemic, or, non, systemic, a, systemic, pesticide, moves, translocates, inside, the, plant, translocation, may, be, upward, in, the, xylem, or, downward, in, the, phloem, or, both, non, systemic, pesticides, contact, pesticides, remain, on, the, surface, and, act, through, direct, contact, with, the, target, organism, pesticides, are, more, effective, if, they, are, systemic, systemicity, is, a, prerequisite, for, the, pesticide, to, be, used, as, a, seed, treatment, pesticides, can, be, classified, as, persistent, non, biodegradable, or, non, persistent, biodegradable, a, pesticide, must, be, persistent, enough, to, kill, or, control, its, target, but, must, degrade, fast, enough, not, to, accumulate, in, the, environment, or, the, food, chain, in, order, to, be, approved, by, the, authorities, persistent, pesticides, including, ddt, were, banned, many, years, ago, an, exception, being, spraying, in, houses, to, combat, malaria, vectors, from, biblical, times, until, the, 1950s, the, pesticides, used, were, inorganic, compounds, and, plant, extracts, the, inorganic, compounds, were, derivatives, of, copper, arsenic, mercury, sulfur, among, others, and, the, plant, extracts, contained, pyrethrum, nicotine, and, rotenone, among, others, the, less, toxic, of, these, are, still, in, use, in, organic, farming, in, the, 1940s, the, insecticide, ddt, and, the, herbicide, 2, 4, d, were, introduced, these, synthetic, organic, i, e, non, inorganic, compounds, were, widely, used, and, were, very, profitable, they, were, followed, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, by, numerous, other, synthetic, pesticides, which, led, to, the, growth, of, the, pesticide, industry, during, this, period, it, became, increasing, evident, that, ddt, which, had, been, sprayed, widely, in, the, environment, to, combat, the, vector, had, accumulated, in, the, food, chain, and, become, a, global, pollutant, as, summarised, in, the, well, known, book, silent, spring, finally, ddt, was, banned, in, the, 1970s, in, several, countries, and, subsequently, all, persistent, pesticides, were, banned, worldwide, an, exception, being, spraying, on, interior, walls, for, vector, control, resistance, to, a, pesticide, was, first, seen, in, the, 1920s, with, inorganic, pesticides, and, later, it, was, found, that, development, of, resistance, is, to, be, expected, and, measures, to, delay, it, are, important, integrated, pest, management, ipm, was, introduced, in, the, 1950s, by, careful, analysis, and, spraying, only, when, an, economical, or, biological, threshold, of, crop, damage, is, reached, pesticide, application, is, reduced, this, became, in, the, 2020s, the, official, policy, of, international, organisations, industry, and, many, governments, with, the, introduction, of, high, yielding, varieties, in, the, 1960s, in, the, green, revolution, more, pesticides, were, used, since, the, 1980s, genetically, modified, crops, were, introduced, which, resulted, in, lower, amounts, of, insecticides, used, on, them, organic, agriculture, which, uses, only, non, synthetic, pesticides, has, grown, and, in, 2020, represents, about, 1, 5, per, cent, of, the, world, s, total, agricultural, land, pesticides, have, become, more, effective, application, rates, fell, from, 1, 000, 2, 500, grams, of, active, ingredient, per, hectare, g, ha, in, the, 1950s, to, 40, 100, g, ha, in, the, 2000s, despite, this, amounts, used, have, increased, in, high, income, countries, over, 20, years, between, the, 1990s, and, 2010s, amounts, used, increased, 20, while, in, the, low, income, countries, amounts, increased, 1623, the, aim, is, to, find, new, compounds, or, agents, with, improved, properties, such, as, a, new, mode, of, action, or, lower, application, rate, another, aim, is, to, replace, older, pesticides, which, have, been, banned, for, reasons, of, toxicity, or, environmental, harm, or, have, become, less, effective, due, to, development, of, resistance, the, process, starts, with, testing, screening, against, target, organisms, such, as, insects, fungi, or, plants, inputs, are, typically, random, compounds, natural, products, compounds, designed, to, disrupt, a, biochemical, target, compounds, described, in, patents, or, literature, or, biocontro, l, organisms, compounds, that, are, active, in, the, screening, process, known, as, hits, or, leads, cannot, be, used, as, pesticides, except, for, biocontrol, organisms, and, some, potent, natural, products, these, lead, compounds, need, to, be, optimised, by, a, series, of, cycles, of, synthesis, and, testing, of, analogs, for, approval, by, regulatory, authorities, for, use, as, pesticides, the, optimized, compounds, must, meet, several, requirements, in, addition, to, being, potent, low, application, rate, they, must, show, low, toxicity, low, environmental, impact, and, viable, manufacturing, cost, the, cost, of, developing, a, pesticide, in, 2022, was, estimated, to, be, 350, million, us, dollars, it, has, become, more, difficult, to, find, new, pesticides, more, than, 100, new, active, ingredients, were, introduced, in, the, 2000s, and, less, than, 40, in, the, 2010s, biopesticides, are, cheaper, to, develop, since, the, authorities, require, less, toxicological, and, environmental, study, since, 2000, the, rate, of, new, biological, product, introduction, has, frequently, exceeded, that, of, conventional, products, more, than, 25, of, existing, chemical, pesticides, contain, one, or, more, chiral, centres, stereogenic, centres, newer, pesticides, with, lower, application, rates, tend, to, have, more, complex, structures, and, thus, more, often, contain, chiral, centres, in, cases, when, most, or, all, of, the, pesticidal, activity, in, a, new, compound, is, found, in, one, enantiomer, the, eutomer, the, registration, and, use, of, the, compound, as, this, single, enantiomer, is, preferred, this, reduces, the, total, application, rate, and, avoids, the, tedious, environmental, testing, required, when, registering, a, racemate, however, if, a, viable, enantioselective, manufacturing, route, cannot, be, found, then, the, racemate, is, registered, and, used, insecticides, with, systemic, activity, against, sucking, pests, which, are, safe, to, pollinators, are, sought, after, particularly, in, view, of, the, partial, bans, on, neonicotinoids, revised, 2023, guidance, by, registration, authorities, describes, the, bee, testing, that, is, required, for, new, insecticides, to, be, approved, for, commercial, use, in, addition, to, their, main, use, in, agriculture, pesticides, have, a, number, of, other, applications, pesticides, are, used, to, control, organisms, that, are, considered, to, be, harmful, or, pernicious, to, their, surroundings, for, example, they, are, used, to, kill, mosquitoes, that, can, transmit, potentially, deadly, diseases, like, west, nile, virus, yellow, fever, and, malaria, they, can, also, kill, bees, wasps, or, ants, that, can, cause, allergic, reactions, insecticides, can, protect, animals, from, illnesses, that, can, be, caused, by, parasites, such, as, fleas, pesticides, can, prevent, sickness, in, humans, that, could, be, caused, by, moldy, food, or, diseased, produce, herbicides, can, be, used, to, clear, roadside, weeds, trees, and, brush, they, can, also, kill, invasive, weeds, that, may, cause, environmental, damage, herbicides, are, commonly, applied, in, ponds, and, lakes, to, control, algae, and, plants, such, as, water, grasses, that, can, interfere, with, activities, like, swimming, and, fishing, and, cause, the, water, to, look, or, smell, unpleasant, uncontrolled, pests, such, as, termites, and, mold, can, damage, structures, such, as, houses, pesticides, are, used, in, grocery, stores, and, food, storage, facilities, to, manage, rodents, and, insects, that, infest, food, such, as, grain, pesticides, are, used, on, lawns, and, golf, courses, partly, for, cosmetic, reasons, integrated, pest, management, the, use, of, multiple, approaches, to, control, pests, is, becoming, widespread, and, has, been, used, with, success, in, countries, such, as, indonesia, china, bangladesh, the, u, s, australia, and, mexico, ipm, attempts, to, recognize, the, more, widespread, impacts, of, an, action, on, an, ecosystem, so, that, natural, balances, are, not, upset, each, use, of, a, pesticide, carries, some, associated, risk, proper, pesticide, use, decreases, these, associated, risks, to, a, level, deemed, acceptable, by, pesticide, regulatory, agencies, such, as, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, and, the, pest, management, regulatory, agency, pmra, of, canada, ddt, sprayed, on, the, walls, of, houses, is, an, organochlorine, that, has, been, used, to, fight, malaria, vectors, mosquitos, since, the, 1940s, the, world, health, organization, recommend, this, approach, it, and, other, organochlorine, pesticides, have, been, banned, in, most, countries, worldwide, because, of, their, persistence, in, the, environment, and, human, toxicity, ddt, has, become, less, effective, as, resistance, was, identified, in, africa, as, early, as, 1955, and, by, 1972, nineteen, species, of, mosquito, worldwide, were, resistant, to, ddt, total, pesticides, use, in, agriculture, in, 2021, was, 3, 54, million, tonnes, of, active, ingredients, mt, a, 4, percent, increase, with, respect, to, 2020, an, 11, percent, increase, in, a, decade, and, a, doubling, since, 1990, pesticides, use, per, area, of, cropland, in, 2021, was, 2, 26, kg, per, hectare, kg, ha, an, increase, of, 4, percent, with, respect, to, 2020, use, per, value, of, agricultural, production, was, 0, 86, kg, per, thousand, international, dollar, kg, 1000, i, 2, and, use, per, person, was, 0, 45, kg, per, capita, kg, cap, 3, between, 1990, and, 2021, these, indicators, increased, by, 85, percent, 3, percent, and, 33, percent, respectively, brazil, was, the, world, s, largest, user, of, pesticides, in, 2021, with, 720, kt, of, pesticides, applications, for, agricultural, use, while, the, usa, 457, kt, was, the, second, largest, user, applications, per, cropland, area, in, 2021, varied, widely, from, 10, 9, kg, hectare, in, brazil, to, 0, 8, kg, ha, in, the, russian, federation, the, level, in, brazil, was, about, twice, as, high, as, in, argentina, 5, 6, kg, ha, and, indonesia, 5, 3, kg, ha, insecticide, use, in, the, us, has, declined, by, more, than, half, since, 1980, 0, 6, yr, mostly, due, to, the, near, phase, out, of, organophosphates, in, corn, fields, the, decline, was, even, steeper, due, to, the, switchover, to, transgenic, bt, corn, pesticides, increase, agricultural, yields, and, lower, costs, one, study, found, that, not, using, pesticides, reduced, crop, yields, by, about, 10, another, study, conducted, in, 1999, found, that, a, ban, on, pesticides, in, the, united, states, may, result, in, a, rise, of, food, prices, loss, of, jobs, and, an, increase, in, world, hunger, there, are, two, levels, of, benefits, for, pesticide, use, primary, and, secondary, primary, benefits, are, direct, gains, from, the, use, of, pesticides, and, secondary, benefits, are, effects, that, are, more, long, term, controlling, pests, and, plant, disease, vectors, controlling, human, livestock, disease, vectors, and, nuisance, organisms, controlling, organisms, that, harm, other, human, activities, and, structures, in, 2018, world, pesticide, sales, were, estimated, to, be, 65, billion, of, which, 88, was, used, for, agriculture, generic, accounted, for, 85, of, sales, in, 2018, in, one, study, it, was, estimated, that, for, every, dollar, 1, that, is, spent, on, pesticides, for, crops, results, in, up, to, four, dollars, 4, in, crops, which, would, otherwise, be, lost, to, insects, fungi, and, weeds, in, general, farmers, benefit, from, having, an, increase, in, crop, yield, and, from, being, able, to, grow, a, variety, of, crops, throughout, the, year, consumers, of, agricultural, products, also, benefit, from, being, able, to, afford, the, vast, quantities, of, produce, available, year, round, on, the, cost, side, of, pesticide, use, there, can, be, costs, to, the, environment, and, costs, to, human, health, pesticides, safety, education, and, pesticide, applicator, regulation, are, designed, to, protect, the, public, from, pesticide, misuse, but, do, not, eliminate, all, misuse, reducing, the, use, of, pesticides, and, choosing, less, toxic, pesticides, may, reduce, risks, placed, on, society, and, the, environment, from, pesticide, use, pesticides, may, affect, health, negatively, mimicking, hormones, causing, reproductive, problems, and, also, causing, cancer, a, 2007, systematic, review, found, that, most, studies, on, non, hodgkin, lymphoma, and, leukemia, showed, positive, associations, with, pesticide, exposure, and, thus, concluded, that, cosmetic, use, of, pesticides, should, be, decreased, there, is, substantial, evidence, of, associations, between, organophosphate, insecticide, exposures, and, neurobehavioral, alterations, limited, evidence, also, exists, for, other, negative, outcomes, from, pesticide, exposure, including, neurological, birth, defects, and, fetal, death, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, recommends, limiting, exposure, of, children, to, pesticides, and, using, safer, alternatives, pesticides, are, also, found, in, majority, of, u, s, households, with, 88, million, out, of, the, 121, 1, million, households, indicating, that, they, use, some, form, of, pesticide, in, 2012, as, of, 2007, there, were, more, than, 1, 055, active, ingredients, registered, as, pesticides, which, yield, over, 20, 000, pesticide, products, that, are, marketed, in, the, united, states, owing, to, inadequate, regulation, and, safety, precautions, 99, of, pesticide, related, deaths, occur, in, developing, countries, that, account, for, only, 25, of, pesticide, usage, one, study, found, pesticide, self, poisoning, the, method, of, choice, in, one, third, of, suicides, worldwide, and, recommended, among, other, things, more, restrictions, on, the, types, of, pesticides, that, are, most, harmful, to, humans, a, 2014, epidemiological, review, found, associations, between, autism, and, exposure, to, certain, pesticides, but, noted, that, the, available, evidence, was, insufficient, to, conclude, that, the, relationship, was, causal, the, world, health, organization, and, the, un, environment, programme, estimate, that, 3, million, agricultural, workers, in, the, developing, world, experience, severe, poisoning, from, pesticides, each, year, resulting, in, 18, 000, deaths, according, to, one, study, as, many, as, 25, million, workers, in, developing, countries, may, suffer, mild, pesticide, poisoning, yearly, other, occupational, exposures, besides, agricultural, workers, including, pet, groomers, groundskeepers, and, fumigators, may, also, put, individuals, at, risk, of, health, effects, from, pesticides, pesticide, use, is, widespread, in, latin, america, as, around, us, 3, billion, are, spent, each, year, in, the, region, records, indicate, an, increase, in, the, frequency, of, pesticide, poisonings, over, the, past, two, decades, the, most, common, incidents, of, pesticide, poisoning, is, thought, to, result, from, exposure, to, organophosphate, and, carbamate, insecticides, at, home, pesticide, use, use, of, unregulated, products, and, the, role, of, undocumented, workers, within, the, agricultural, industry, makes, characterizing, true, pesticide, exposure, a, challenge, it, is, estimated, that, 50, 80, of, pesticide, poisoning, cases, are, unreported, underreporting, of, pesticide, poisoning, is, especially, common, in, areas, where, agricultural, workers, are, less, likely, to, seek, care, from, a, healthcare, facility, that, may, be, monitoring, or, tracking, the, incidence, of, acute, poisoning, the, extent, of, unintentional, pesticide, poisoning, may, be, much, greater, than, available, data, suggest, particularly, among, developing, countries, globally, agriculture, and, food, production, remain, one, of, the, largest, industries, in, east, africa, the, agricultural, industry, represents, one, of, the, largest, sectors, of, the, economy, with, nearly, 80, of, its, population, relying, on, agriculture, for, income, farmers, in, these, communities, rely, on, pesticide, products, to, maintain, high, crop, yields, some, east, africa, governments, are, shifting, to, corporate, farming, and, opportunities, for, foreign, conglomerates, to, operate, commercial, farms, have, led, to, more, accessible, research, on, pesticide, use, and, exposure, among, workers, in, other, areas, where, large, proportions, of, the, population, rely, on, subsistence, small, scale, farming, estimating, pesticide, use, and, exposure, is, more, difficult, pesticides, may, exhibit, toxic, effects, on, humans, and, other, non, target, species, the, severity, of, which, depends, on, the, frequency, and, magnitude, of, exposure, toxicity, also, depends, on, the, rate, of, absorption, distribution, within, the, body, metabolism, and, elimination, of, compounds, from, the, body, commonly, used, pesticides, like, organophosphates, and, carbamates, act, by, inhibiting, acetylcholinesterase, activity, which, prevents, the, breakdown, of, acetylcholine, at, the, neural, synapse, excess, acetylcholine, can, lead, to, symptoms, like, muscle, cramps, or, tremors, confusion, dizziness, and, nausea, studies, show, that, farm, workers, in, ethiopia, kenya, and, zimbabwe, have, decreased, concentrations, of, plasma, acetylcholinesterase, the, enzyme, responsible, for, breaking, down, acetylcholine, acting, on, synapses, throughout, the, nervous, system, other, studies, in, ethiopia, have, observed, reduced, respiratory, function, among, farm, workers, who, spray, crops, with, pesticides, numerous, exposure, pathways, for, farm, workers, increase, the, risk, of, pesticide, poisoning, including, dermal, absorption, walking, through, fields, and, applying, products, as, well, as, inhalation, exposure, there, are, multiple, approaches, to, measuring, a, person, s, exposure, to, pesticides, each, of, which, provides, an, estimate, of, an, individual, s, internal, dose, two, broad, approaches, include, measuring, biomarkers, and, markers, of, biological, effect, the, former, involves, taking, direct, measurement, of, the, parent, compound, or, its, metabolites, in, various, types, of, media, urine, blood, serum, biomarkers, may, include, a, direct, measurement, of, the, compound, in, the, body, before, it, s, been, biotransformed, during, metabolism, other, suitable, biomarkers, may, include, the, metabolites, of, the, parent, compound, after, they, ve, been, biotransformed, during, metabolism, toxicokinetic, data, can, provide, more, detailed, information, on, how, quickly, the, compound, is, metabolized, and, eliminated, from, the, body, and, provide, insights, into, the, timing, of, exposure, markers, of, biological, effect, provide, an, estimation, of, exposure, based, on, cellular, activities, related, to, the, mechanism, of, action, for, example, many, studies, investigating, exposure, to, pesticides, often, involve, the, quantification, of, the, acetylcholinesterase, enzyme, at, the, neural, synapse, to, determine, the, magnitude, of, the, inhibitory, effect, of, organophosphate, and, carbamate, pesticides, another, method, of, quantifying, exposure, involves, measuring, at, the, molecular, level, the, amount, of, pesticide, interacting, with, the, site, of, action, these, methods, are, more, commonly, used, for, occupational, exposures, where, the, mechanism, of, action, is, better, understood, as, described, by, who, guidelines, published, in, biological, monitoring, of, chemical, exposure, in, the, workplace, better, understanding, of, how, pesticides, elicit, their, toxic, effects, is, needed, before, this, method, of, exposure, assessment, can, be, applied, to, occupational, exposure, of, agricultural, workers, alternative, methods, to, assess, exposure, include, questionnaires, to, discern, from, participants, whether, they, are, experiencing, symptoms, associated, with, pesticide, poisoning, self, reported, symptoms, may, include, headaches, dizziness, nausea, joint, pain, or, respiratory, symptoms, multiple, challenges, exist, in, assessing, exposure, to, pesticides, in, the, general, population, and, many, others, that, are, specific, to, occupational, exposures, of, agricultural, workers, beyond, farm, workers, estimating, exposure, to, family, members, and, children, presents, additional, challenges, and, may, occur, through, take, home, exposure, from, pesticide, residues, collected, on, clothing, or, equipment, belonging, to, parent, farm, workers, and, inadvertently, brought, into, the, home, children, may, also, be, exposed, to, pesticides, prenatally, from, mothers, who, are, exposed, to, pesticides, during, pregnancy, characterizing, children, s, exposure, resulting, from, drift, of, airborne, and, spray, application, of, pesticides, is, similarly, challenging, yet, well, documented, in, developing, countries, because, of, critical, development, periods, of, the, fetus, and, newborn, children, these, non, working, populations, are, more, vulnerable, to, the, effects, of, pesticides, and, may, be, at, increased, risk, of, developing, neurocognitive, effects, and, impaired, development, while, measuring, biomarkers, or, markers, of, biological, effects, may, provide, more, accurate, estimates, of, exposure, collecting, these, data, in, the, field, is, often, impractical, and, many, methods, are, not, sensitive, enough, to, detect, low, level, concentrations, rapid, cholinesterase, test, kits, exist, to, collect, blood, samples, in, the, field, conducting, large, scale, assessments, of, agricultural, workers, in, remote, regions, of, developing, countries, makes, the, implementation, of, these, kits, a, challenge, the, cholinesterase, assay, is, a, useful, clinical, tool, to, assess, individual, exposure, and, acute, toxicity, considerable, variability, in, baseline, enzyme, activity, among, individuals, makes, it, difficult, to, compare, field, measurements, of, cholinesterase, activity, to, a, reference, dose, to, determine, health, risk, associated, with, exposure, another, challenge, researchers, face, in, deriving, a, reference, dose, is, identifying, health, endpoints, that, are, relevant, to, exposure, more, epidemiological, research, is, needed, to, identify, critical, health, endpoints, particularly, among, populations, who, are, occupationally, exposed, minimizing, harmful, exposure, to, pesticides, can, be, achieved, by, proper, use, of, personal, protective, equipment, adequate, reentry, times, into, recently, sprayed, areas, and, effective, product, labeling, for, hazardous, substances, as, per, fifra, regulations, training, high, risk, populations, including, agricultural, workers, on, the, proper, use, and, storage, of, pesticides, can, reduce, the, incidence, of, acute, pesticide, poisoning, and, potential, chronic, health, effects, associated, with, exposure, continued, research, into, the, human, toxic, health, effects, of, pesticides, serves, as, a, basis, for, relevant, policies, and, enforceable, standards, that, are, health, protective, to, all, populations, pesticide, use, raises, a, number, of, environmental, concerns, over, 98, of, sprayed, insecticides, and, 95, of, herbicides, reach, a, destination, other, than, their, target, species, including, non, target, species, air, water, and, soil, pesticide, drift, occurs, when, pesticides, suspended, in, the, air, as, particles, are, carried, by, wind, to, other, areas, potentially, contaminating, them, pesticides, are, one, of, the, causes, of, water, pollution, and, some, pesticides, were, persistent, organic, pollutants, now, banned, which, contribute, to, soil, and, flower, pollen, nectar, contamination, furthermore, pesticide, use, can, adversely, impact, neighboring, agricultural, activity, as, pests, themselves, drift, to, and, harm, nearby, crops, that, have, no, pesticide, used, on, them, in, addition, pesticide, use, reduces, biodiversity, contributes, to, pollinator, decline, destroys, habitat, especially, for, birds, and, threatens, endangered, species, pests, can, develop, a, resistance, to, the, pesticide, pesticide, resistance, necessitating, a, new, pesticide, alternatively, a, greater, dose, of, the, pesticide, can, be, used, to, counteract, the, resistance, although, this, will, cause, a, worsening, of, the, ambient, pollution, problem, the, stockholm, convention, on, persistent, organic, pollutants, banned, all, persistent, pesticides, in, particular, ddt, and, other, organochlorine, pesticides, which, were, stable, and, lipophilic, and, thus, able, to, bioaccumulate, in, the, body, and, the, food, chain, and, which, spread, throughout, the, planet, persistent, pesticides, are, no, longer, used, for, agriculture, and, will, not, be, approved, by, the, authorities, because, the, half, life, in, soil, is, long, for, ddt, 2, 15, years, residues, can, still, be, detected, in, humans, at, levels, 5, to, 10, times, lower, than, found, in, the, 1970s, pesticides, now, have, to, be, degradable, in, the, environment, such, degradation, of, pesticides, is, due, to, both, innate, chemical, properties, of, the, compounds, and, environmental, processes, or, conditions, for, example, the, presence, of, halogens, within, a, chemical, structure, often, slows, down, degradation, in, an, aerobic, environment, adsorption, to, soil, may, retard, pesticide, movement, but, also, may, reduce, bioavailability, to, microbial, degraders, pesticide, contamination, in, the, environment, can, be, monitored, through, bioindicators, such, as, bee, pollinators, in, one, study, the, human, health, and, environmental, costs, due, to, pesticides, in, the, united, states, was, estimated, to, be, 9, 6, billion, offset, by, about, 40, billion, in, increased, agricultural, production, additional, costs, include, the, registration, process, and, the, cost, of, purchasing, pesticides, which, are, typically, borne, by, agrichemical, companies, and, farmers, respectively, the, registration, process, can, take, several, years, to, complete, there, are, 70, different, types, of, field, tests, and, can, cost, 50, 70, million, for, a, single, pesticide, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, the, united, states, spent, approximately, 10, billion, on, pesticides, annually, the, use, of, pesticides, inherently, entails, the, risk, of, resistance, developing, various, techniques, and, procedures, of, pesticide, application, can, slow, the, development, of, resistance, as, can, some, natural, features, of, the, target, population, and, surrounding, environment, alternatives, to, pesticides, are, available, and, include, methods, of, cultivation, use, of, biological, pest, controls, such, as, pheromones, and, microbial, pesticides, genetic, engineering, mostly, of, crops, and, methods, of, interfering, with, insect, breeding, application, of, composted, yard, waste, has, also, been, used, as, a, way, of, controlling, pests, these, methods, are, becoming, increasingly, popular, and, often, are, safer, than, traditional, chemical, pesticides, in, addition, epa, is, registering, reduced, risk, pesticides, in, increasing, numbers, cultivation, practices, include, polyculture, growing, multiple, types, of, plants, crop, rotation, planting, crops, in, areas, where, the, pests, that, damage, them, do, not, live, timing, planting, according, to, when, pests, will, be, least, problematic, and, use, of, trap, crops, that, attract, pests, away, from, the, real, crop, trap, crops, have, successfully, controlled, pests, in, some, commercial, agricultural, systems, while, reducing, pesticide, usage, in, other, systems, trap, crops, can, fail, to, reduce, pest, densities, at, a, commercial, scale, even, when, the, trap, crop, works, in, controlled, experiments, release, of, other, organisms, that, fight, the, pest, is, another, example, of, an, alternative, to, pesticide, use, these, organisms, can, include, natural, predators, or, parasites, of, the, pests, biological, pesticides, based, on, entomopathogenic, fungi, bacteria, and, viruses, causing, disease, in, the, pest, species, can, also, be, used, interfering, with, insects, reproduction, can, be, accomplished, by, sterilizing, males, of, the, target, species, and, releasing, them, so, that, they, mate, with, females, but, do, not, produce, offspring, this, technique, was, first, used, on, the, screwworm, fly, in, 1958, and, has, since, been, used, with, the, medfly, the, tsetse, fly, and, the, gypsy, moth, this, is, a, costly, and, slow, approach, that, only, works, on, some, types, of, insects, other, alternatives, include, laserweeding, the, use, of, novel, agricultural, robots, for, weed, control, using, lasers, the, term, push, pull, was, established, in, 1987, as, an, approach, for, integrated, pest, management, ipm, this, strategy, uses, a, mixture, of, behavior, modifying, stimuli, to, manipulate, the, distribution, and, abundance, of, insects, push, means, the, insects, are, repelled, or, deterred, away, from, whatever, resource, is, being, protected, pull, means, that, certain, stimuli, semiochemical, stimuli, pheromones, food, additives, visual, stimuli, genetically, altered, plants, etc, are, used, to, attract, pests, to, trap, crops, where, they, will, be, killed, there, are, numerous, different, components, involved, in, order, to, implement, a, push, pull, strategy, in, ipm, many, case, studies, testing, the, effectiveness, of, the, push, pull, approach, have, been, done, across, the, world, the, most, successful, push, pull, strategy, was, developed, in, africa, for, subsistence, farming, another, successful, case, study, was, performed, on, the, control, of, helicoverpa, in, cotton, crops, in, australia, in, europe, the, middle, east, and, the, united, states, push, pull, strategies, were, successfully, used, in, the, controlling, of, sitona, lineatus, in, bean, fields, some, advantages, of, using, the, push, pull, method, are, less, use, of, chemical, or, biological, materials, and, better, protection, against, insect, habituation, to, this, control, method, some, disadvantages, of, the, push, pull, strategy, are, that, if, there, is, a, lack, of, appropriate, knowledge, of, the, behavioral, and, chemical, ecology, of, the, host, pest, interactions, then, this, method, becomes, unreliable, furthermore, because, the, push, pull, method, is, not, a, very, popular, method, of, ipm, operational, and, registration, costs, are, higher, some, evidence, shows, that, alternatives, to, pesticides, can, be, equally, effective, as, the, use, of, chemicals, a, study, of, maize, fields, in, northern, florida, found, that, the, application, of, composted, yard, waste, with, high, carbon, to, nitrogen, ratio, to, agricultural, fields, was, highly, effective, at, reducing, the, population, of, plant, parasitic, nematodes, and, increasing, crop, yield, with, yield, increases, ranging, from, 10, to, 212, the, observed, effects, were, long, term, often, not, appearing, until, the, third, season, of, the, study, additional, silicon, nutrition, protects, some, horticultural, crops, against, fungal, diseases, almost, completely, while, insufficient, silicon, sometimes, leads, to, severe, infection, even, when, fungicides, are, used, pesticide, resistance, is, increasing, and, that, may, make, alternatives, more, attractive, biopesticides, are, certain, types, of, pesticides, derived, from, such, natural, materials, as, animals, plants, bacteria, and, certain, minerals, for, example, canola, oil, and, baking, soda, have, pesticidal, applications, and, are, considered, biopesticides, biopesticides, fall, into, three, major, classes, pesticides, that, are, related, to, the, type, of, pests, are, in, many, countries, pesticides, must, be, approved, for, sale, and, use, by, a, government, agency, worldwide, 85, of, countries, have, pesticide, legislation, for, the, proper, storage, of, pesticides, and, 51, include, provisions, to, ensure, proper, disposal, of, all, obsolete, pesticides, though, pesticide, regulations, differ, from, country, to, country, pesticides, and, products, on, which, they, were, used, are, traded, across, international, borders, to, deal, with, inconsistencies, in, regulations, among, countries, delegates, to, a, conference, of, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, adopted, an, international, code, of, conduct, on, the, distribution, and, use, of, pesticides, in, 1985, to, create, voluntary, standards, of, pesticide, regulation, for, different, countries, the, code, was, updated, in, 1998, and, 2002, the, fao, claims, that, the, code, has, raised, awareness, about, pesticide, hazards, and, decreased, the, number, of, countries, without, restrictions, on, pesticide, use, three, other, efforts, to, improve, regulation, of, international, pesticide, trade, are, the, united, nations, london, guidelines, for, the, exchange, of, information, on, chemicals, in, international, trade, and, the, united, nations, codex, alimentarius, commission, the, former, seeks, to, implement, procedures, for, ensuring, that, prior, informed, consent, exists, between, countries, buying, and, selling, pesticides, while, the, latter, seeks, to, create, uniform, standards, for, maximum, levels, of, pesticide, residues, among, participating, countries, in, the, united, states, the, environmental, protection, agency, epa, is, responsible, for, regulating, pesticides, under, the, federal, insecticide, fungicide, and, rodenticide, act, fifra, and, the, food, quality, protection, act, fqpa, studies, must, be, conducted, to, establish, the, conditions, in, which, the, material, is, safe, to, use, and, the, effectiveness, against, the, intended, pest, s, the, epa, regulates, pesticides, to, ensure, that, these, products, do, not, pose, adverse, effects, to, humans, or, the, environment, with, an, emphasis, on, the, health, and, safety, of, children, pesticides, produced, before, november, 1984, continue, to, be, reassessed, in, order, to, meet, the, current, scientific, and, regulatory, standards, all, registered, pesticides, are, reviewed, every, 15, years, to, ensure, they, meet, the, proper, standards, during, the, registration, process, a, label, is, created, the, label, contains, directions, for, proper, use, of, the, material, in, addition, to, safety, restrictions, based, on, acute, toxicity, pesticides, are, assigned, to, a, toxicity, class, pesticides, are, the, most, thoroughly, tested, chemicals, after, drugs, in, the, united, states, those, used, on, food, require, more, than, 100, tests, to, determine, a, range, of, potential, impacts, some, pesticides, are, considered, too, hazardous, for, sale, to, the, general, public, and, are, designated, restricted, use, pesticides, only, certified, applicators, who, have, passed, an, exam, may, purchase, or, supervise, the, application, of, restricted, use, pesticides, records, of, sales, and, use, are, required, to, be, maintained, and, may, be, audited, by, government, agencies, charged, with, the, enforcement, of, pesticide, regulations, these, records, must, be, made, available, to, employees, and, state, or, territorial, environmental, regulatory, agencies, in, addition, to, the, epa, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, usda, and, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, fda, set, standards, for, the, level, of, pesticide, residue, that, is, allowed, on, or, in, crops, the, epa, looks, at, what, the, potential, human, health, and, environmental, effects, might, be, associated, with, the, use, of, the, pesticide, in, addition, the, u, s, epa, uses, the, national, research, council, s, four, step, process, for, human, health, risk, assessment, 1, hazard, identification, 2, dose, response, assessment, 3, exposure, assessment, and, 4, risk, characterization, in, 2013, kaua, i, county, hawai, i, passed, bill, no, 2491, to, add, an, article, to, chapter, 22, of, the, county, s, code, relating, to, pesticides, and, gmos, the, bill, strengthens, protections, of, local, communities, in, kaua, i, where, many, large, pesticide, companies, test, their, products, the, first, legislation, providing, federal, authority, for, regulating, pesticides, was, enacted, in, 1910, eu, legislation, has, been, approved, banning, the, use, of, highly, toxic, pesticides, including, those, that, are, carcinogenic, mutagenic, or, toxic, to, reproduction, those, that, are, endocrine, disrupting, and, those, that, are, persistent, bioaccumulative, and, toxic, pbt, or, very, persistent, and, very, bioaccumulative, vpvb, and, measures, have, been, approved, to, improve, the, general, safety, of, pesticides, across, all, eu, member, states, in, 2023, the, environment, committee, of, european, parliament, approved, a, decision, aiming, to, reduce, pesticide, use, by, 50, the, most, hazardous, by, 65, by, the, year, 2030, and, ensure, sustainable, use, of, pesticides, for, example, use, them, only, as, a, last, resort, the, decision, also, includes, measures, for, providing, farmers, with, alternatives, pesticide, residue, refers, to, the, pesticides, that, may, remain, on, or, in, food, after, they, are, applied, to, food, crops, the, maximum, residue, limits, mrl, of, pesticides, in, food, are, carefully, set, by, the, regulatory, authorities, to, ensure, to, their, best, judgement, no, health, impacts, regulations, such, as, pre, harvest, intervals, also, often, prevent, harvest, of, crop, or, livestock, products, if, recently, treated, in, order, to, allow, residue, concentrations, to, decrease, over, time, to, safe, levels, before, harvest, exposure, of, the, general, population, to, these, residues, most, commonly, occurs, through, consumption, of, treated, food, sources, or, being, in, close, contact, to, areas, treated, with, pesticides, such, as, farms, or, lawns, persistent, pesticides, are, no, longer, used, for,
