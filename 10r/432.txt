a, loom, is, a, device, used, to, weave, cloth, and, tapestry, the, basic, purpose, of, any, loom, is, to, hold, the, warp, threads, under, tension, to, facilitate, the, interweaving, of, the, weft, threads, the, precise, shape, of, the, loom, and, its, mechanics, may, vary, but, the, basic, function, is, the, same, the, word, loom, derives, from, the, old, english, geloma, formed, from, ge, perfective, prefix, and, loma, a, root, of, unknown, origin, the, whole, word, geloma, meant, a, utensil, tool, or, machine, of, any, kind, in, 1404, lome, was, used, to, mean, a, machine, to, enable, weaving, thread, into, cloth, by, 1838, loom, had, gained, the, additional, meaning, of, a, machine, for, interlacing, thread, weaving, is, done, on, two, sets, of, threads, or, yarns, which, cross, one, another, the, warp, threads, are, the, ones, stretched, on, the, loom, from, the, proto, indo, european, werp, to, bend, each, thread, of, the, weft, i, e, that, which, is, woven, is, inserted, so, that, it, passes, over, and, under, the, warp, threads, the, ends, of, the, warp, threads, are, usually, fastened, to, beams, one, end, is, fastened, to, one, beam, the, other, end, to, a, second, beam, so, that, the, warp, threads, all, lie, parallel, and, are, all, the, same, length, the, beams, are, held, apart, to, keep, the, warp, threads, taut, the, textile, is, woven, starting, at, one, end, of, the, warp, threads, and, progressing, towards, the, other, end, the, beam, on, the, finished, fabric, end, is, called, the, cloth, beam, the, other, beam, is, called, the, warp, beam, beams, may, be, used, as, rollers, to, allow, the, weaver, to, weave, a, piece, of, cloth, longer, than, the, loom, as, the, cloth, is, woven, the, warp, threads, are, gradually, unrolled, from, the, warp, beam, and, the, woven, portion, of, the, cloth, is, rolled, up, onto, the, cloth, beam, which, is, also, called, the, takeup, roll, the, portion, of, the, fabric, that, has, already, been, formed, but, not, yet, rolled, up, on, the, takeup, roll, is, called, the, fell, not, all, looms, have, two, beams, for, instance, warp, weighted, looms, have, only, one, beam, the, warp, yarns, hang, from, this, beam, the, bottom, ends, of, the, warp, yarns, are, tied, to, dangling, loom, weights, a, loom, has, to, perform, three, principal, motions, shedding, picking, and, battening, there, are, also, usually, two, secondary, motions, because, the, newly, constructed, fabric, must, be, wound, onto, cloth, beam, this, process, is, called, taking, up, at, the, same, time, the, warp, yarns, must, be, let, off, or, released, from, the, warp, beam, unwinding, from, it, to, become, fully, automatic, a, loom, needs, a, tertiary, motion, the, filling, stop, motion, this, will, brake, the, loom, if, the, weft, thread, breaks, an, automatic, loom, requires, 0, 125, hp, to, 0, 5, hp, to, operate, 100w, to, 400w, a, loom, then, usually, needs, two, beams, and, some, way, to, hold, them, apart, it, generally, has, additional, components, to, make, shedding, picking, and, battening, faster, and, easier, there, are, also, often, components, to, help, take, up, the, fell, the, nature, of, the, loom, frame, and, the, shedding, picking, and, battening, devices, vary, looms, come, in, a, wide, variety, of, types, many, of, them, specialized, for, specific, types, of, weaving, they, are, also, specialized, for, the, lifestyle, of, the, weaver, for, instance, nomadic, weavers, tend, to, use, lighter, more, portable, looms, while, weavers, living, in, cramped, city, dwellings, are, more, likely, to, use, a, tall, upright, loom, or, a, loom, that, folds, into, a, narrow, space, when, not, in, use, loom, frames, can, be, roughly, divided, by, the, orientation, of, the, warp, threads, into, horizontal, looms, and, vertical, looms, there, are, many, finer, divisions, most, handloom, frame, designs, can, be, constructed, fairly, simply, the, back, strap, loom, also, known, as, belt, loom, is, a, simple, loom, with, ancient, roots, still, used, in, many, cultures, around, the, world, such, as, andean, textiles, it, consists, of, two, sticks, or, bars, between, which, the, warps, are, stretched, one, bar, is, attached, to, a, fixed, object, and, the, other, to, the, weaver, usually, by, means, of, a, strap, around, the, weaver, s, back, the, weaver, leans, back, and, uses, their, body, weight, to, tension, the, loom, both, simple, and, complex, textiles, can, be, woven, on, backstrap, looms, they, produce, narrowcloth, width, is, limited, to, the, weaver, s, armspan, they, can, readily, produce, warp, faced, textiles, often, decorated, with, intricate, pick, up, patterns, woven, in, complementary, and, supplementary, warp, techniques, and, brocading, balanced, weaves, are, also, possible, on, the, backstrap, loom, the, warp, weighted, loom, is, a, vertical, loom, that, may, have, originated, in, the, neolithic, period, its, defining, characteristic, is, hanging, weights, loom, weights, which, keep, bundles, of, the, warp, threads, taut, frequently, extra, warp, thread, is, wound, around, the, weights, when, a, weaver, has, woven, far, enough, down, the, completed, section, fell, can, be, rolled, around, the, top, beam, and, additional, lengths, of, warp, threads, can, be, unwound, from, the, weights, to, continue, this, frees, the, weaver, from, vertical, size, constraint, horizontally, breadth, is, limited, by, armspan, making, broadwoven, cloth, requires, two, weavers, standing, side, by, side, at, the, loom, simple, weaves, and, complex, weaves, that, need, more, than, two, different, sheds, can, both, be, woven, on, a, warp, weighted, loom, they, can, also, be, used, to, produce, tapestries, in, pegged, looms, the, beams, can, be, simply, held, apart, by, hooking, them, behind, pegs, driven, into, the, ground, with, wedges, or, lashings, used, to, adjust, the, tension, pegged, looms, may, however, also, have, horizontal, sidepieces, holding, the, beams, apart, such, looms, are, easy, to, set, up, and, dismantle, and, are, easy, to, transport, so, they, are, popular, with, nomadic, weavers, they, are, generally, only, used, for, comparatively, small, woven, articles, urbanites, are, unlikely, to, use, horizontal, floor, looms, as, they, take, up, a, lot, of, floor, space, and, full, time, professional, weavers, are, unlikely, to, use, them, as, they, are, unergonomic, their, cheapness, and, portability, is, less, valuable, to, urban, professional, weavers, in, a, treadle, loom, the, shedding, is, controlled, by, the, feet, which, tread, on, the, treadles, the, earliest, evidence, of, a, horizontal, loom, is, found, on, a, pottery, dish, in, ancient, egypt, dated, to, 4400, bc, it, was, a, frame, loom, equipped, with, treadles, to, lift, the, warp, threads, leaving, the, weaver, s, hands, free, to, pass, and, beat, the, weft, thread, a, pit, loom, has, a, pit, for, the, treadles, reducing, the, stress, transmitted, through, the, much, shorter, frame, in, a, wooden, vertical, shaft, loom, the, heddles, are, fixed, in, place, in, the, shaft, the, warp, threads, pass, alternately, through, a, heddle, and, through, a, space, between, the, heddles, the, shed, so, that, raising, the, shaft, raises, half, the, threads, those, passing, through, the, heddles, and, lowering, the, shaft, lowers, the, same, threads, the, threads, passing, through, the, spaces, between, the, heddles, remain, in, place, a, treadle, loom, for, figured, weaving, may, have, a, large, number, of, harnesses, or, a, control, head, it, can, for, instance, have, a, jacquard, machine, attached, to, it, see, loom, shedding, methods, tapestry, can, have, extremely, complex, wefts, as, different, strands, of, wefts, of, different, colours, are, used, to, form, the, pattern, speed, is, lower, and, shedding, and, picking, devices, may, be, simpler, looms, used, for, weaving, traditional, tapestry, are, called, not, as, vertical, warp, and, horizontal, warp, but, as, high, warp, or, low, warp, the, french, terms, haute, lisse, and, basse, lisse, are, also, used, in, english, inkle, looms, are, narrow, looms, used, for, narrow, work, they, are, used, to, make, narrow, warp, faced, strips, such, as, ribbons, bands, or, tape, they, are, often, quite, small, some, are, used, on, a, tabletop, others, are, backstraps, looms, with, a, rigid, heddle, and, very, portable, there, exist, very, small, hand, held, looms, known, as, darning, looms, they, are, made, to, fit, under, the, fabric, being, mended, and, are, often, held, in, place, by, an, elastic, band, on, one, side, of, the, cloth, and, a, groove, around, the, loom, s, darning, egg, portion, on, the, other, they, may, have, heddles, made, of, flip, flopping, rotating, hooks, see, loom, rotating, hook, heddles, other, devices, sold, as, darning, looms, are, just, a, darning, egg, and, a, separate, comb, like, piece, with, teeth, to, hook, the, warp, over, these, are, used, for, repairing, knitted, garments, and, are, like, a, linear, knitting, spool, darning, looms, were, sold, during, world, war, two, clothing, rationing, in, the, united, kingdom, and, canada, and, some, are, homemade, circular, looms, are, used, to, create, seamless, tubes, of, fabric, for, products, such, as, hosiery, sacks, clothing, fabric, hoses, such, as, fire, hoses, and, the, like, tablet, weaving, can, be, used, to, knit, tubes, including, tubes, that, split, and, join, small, jigs, also, used, for, circular, knitting, are, also, sometimes, called, circular, looms, but, they, are, used, for, knitting, not, weaving, it, is, possible, to, weave, by, manually, threading, the, weft, over, and, under, the, warp, threads, but, this, is, slow, some, tapestry, techniques, use, manual, shedding, pin, looms, and, peg, looms, also, generally, have, no, shedding, devices, pile, carpets, generally, do, not, use, shedding, for, the, pile, because, each, pile, thread, is, individually, knotted, onto, the, warps, but, there, may, be, shedding, for, the, weft, holding, the, carpet, together, usually, weaving, uses, shedding, devices, these, devices, pull, some, of, the, warp, threads, to, each, side, so, that, a, shed, is, formed, between, them, and, the, weft, is, passed, through, the, shed, there, are, a, variety, of, methods, for, forming, the, shed, at, least, two, sheds, must, be, formed, the, shed, and, the, countershed, two, sheds, is, enough, for, tabby, weave, more, complex, weaves, such, as, twill, weaves, satin, weaves, diaper, weaves, and, figured, picture, forming, weaves, require, more, sheds, a, shed, rod, shedding, stick, shed, roll, is, simply, a, stick, woven, through, the, warp, threads, when, pulled, perpendicular, to, the, threads, or, rotated, to, stand, on, edge, for, wide, flat, shedding, rods, it, creates, a, shed, to, create, the, counter, shed, a, heddle, bar, is, usually, used, a, heddle, bar, is, simply, a, stick, placed, across, the, warp, and, tied, to, individual, warp, threads, when, it, is, lifted, it, pulls, the, warp, threads, it, is, tied, to, out, of, position, creating, a, shed, a, warp, weighted, loom, see, diagram, typically, uses, a, heddle, bar, it, has, two, upright, posts, c, they, support, a, horizontal, beam, d, which, is, cylindrical, so, that, the, finished, cloth, can, be, rolled, around, it, allowing, the, loom, to, be, used, to, weave, a, piece, of, cloth, taller, than, the, loom, and, preserving, an, ergonomic, working, height, the, warp, threads, f, and, a, and, b, hang, from, the, beam, and, rest, against, the, shed, rod, e, the, heddle, bar, g, is, tied, to, some, of, the, warp, threads, a, but, not, b, using, loops, of, string, called, leashes, h, so, when, the, heddle, rod, is, pulled, out, and, placed, in, the, forked, sticks, protruding, from, the, posts, not, lettered, no, technical, term, given, in, citation, the, shed, 1, is, replaced, by, the, counter, shed, 2, by, passing, the, weft, through, the, shed, and, the, counter, shed, alternately, cloth, is, woven, heddle, rods, are, used, on, modern, tapestry, looms, tablet, weaving, uses, cards, punched, with, holes, the, warp, threads, pass, through, the, holes, and, the, cards, are, twisted, and, shifted, to, created, varied, sheds, this, shedding, technique, is, used, for, narrow, work, it, is, also, used, to, finish, edges, weaving, decorative, selvage, bands, instead, of, hemming, there, are, heddles, made, of, flip, flopping, rotating, hooks, which, raise, and, lower, the, warp, creating, sheds, the, hooks, when, vertical, have, the, weft, threads, looped, around, them, horizontally, if, the, hooks, are, flopped, over, on, side, or, another, the, loop, of, weft, twists, raising, one, or, the, other, side, of, the, loop, which, creates, the, shed, and, countershed, rigid, heddles, are, generally, used, on, single, shaft, looms, odd, warp, threads, go, through, the, slots, and, even, ones, through, the, circular, holes, or, vice, versa, the, shed, is, formed, by, lifting, the, heddle, and, the, countershed, by, depressing, it, the, warp, threads, in, the, slots, stay, where, they, are, and, the, ones, in, the, circular, holes, are, pulled, back, and, forth, a, single, rigid, heddle, can, hold, all, the, warp, threads, though, sometimes, multiple, rigid, heddles, are, used, treadles, may, be, used, to, drive, the, rigid, heddle, up, and, down, rigid, heddles, above, are, called, rigid, to, distinguish, them, from, string, and, metal, heddles, where, each, warp, thread, has, its, own, heddle, which, has, an, eye, at, each, end, and, one, in, the, middle, for, the, warp, thread, the, eyes, in, the, ends, are, fastened, to, a, shaft, all, in, a, row, this, requires, multiple, shafts, it, cannot, be, done, on, a, single, shaft, loom, the, different, shafts, also, called, harnesses, must, be, controlled, by, some, mechanism, while, non, rigid, heddles, generally, mean, that, two, shafts, are, needed, even, for, a, plain, tabby, weave, twill, weaves, require, three, or, more, depending, on, the, type, of, twill, and, more, complex, figured, weaves, require, still, more, harnesses, treadle, looms, can, control, multiple, harnessess, with, multiple, treadles, the, weaver, selects, which, harnesses, are, engaged, with, their, feet, one, treadle, may, be, connected, to, more, than, one, harness, and, any, number, of, treadles, can, be, engaged, at, once, meaning, that, the, number, of, different, sheds, that, can, be, selected, is, two, to, the, power, of, the, number, of, treadles, eight, is, a, large, but, reasonable, number, of, treadles, giving, a, maximum, of, 2, 8, 256, sheds, some, of, which, will, not, have, enough, threads, on, one, side, to, be, useful, the, weaver, must, remember, the, sequence, of, treadling, needed, to, produce, the, pattern, a, drawloom, is, for, weaving, figured, cloth, in, a, drawloom, a, figure, harness, is, used, to, control, each, warp, thread, separately, allowing, very, complex, patterns, a, drawloom, requires, two, operators, the, weaver, and, an, assistant, called, a, drawboy, to, manage, the, figure, harness, the, earliest, confirmed, drawloom, fabrics, come, from, the, state, of, chu, and, date, c, 400, bc, some, scholars, speculate, an, independent, invention, in, ancient, syria, since, drawloom, fabrics, found, in, dura, europas, are, thought, to, date, before, 256, ad, the, draw, loom, was, invented, in, china, during, the, han, dynasty, state, of, liu, foot, powered, multi, harness, looms, and, jacquard, looms, were, used, for, silk, weaving, and, embroidery, both, of, which, were, cottage, industries, with, imperial, workshops, the, drawloom, enhanced, and, sped, up, the, production, of, silk, and, played, a, significant, role, in, chinese, silk, weaving, the, loom, was, introduced, to, persia, india, and, europe, a, dobby, head, is, a, device, that, replaces, the, drawboy, the, weaver, s, helper, who, used, to, control, the, warp, threads, by, pulling, on, draw, threads, dobby, is, a, corruption, of, draw, boy, mechanical, dobbies, pull, on, the, draw, threads, using, pegs, in, bars, to, lift, a, set, of, levers, the, placement, of, the, pegs, determines, which, levers, are, lifted, the, sequence, of, bars, they, are, strung, together, effectively, remembers, the, sequence, for, the, weaver, computer, controlled, dobbies, use, solenoids, instead, of, pegs, the, jacquard, loom, is, a, mechanical, loom, invented, by, joseph, marie, jacquard, in, 1801, which, simplifies, the, process, of, manufacturing, figured, textiles, with, complex, patterns, such, as, brocade, damask, and, matelasse, the, loom, is, controlled, by, punched, cards, with, punched, holes, each, row, of, which, corresponds, to, one, row, of, the, design, multiple, rows, of, holes, are, punched, on, each, card, and, the, many, cards, that, compose, the, design, of, the, textile, are, strung, together, in, order, it, is, based, on, earlier, inventions, by, the, frenchmen, basile, bouchon, 1725, jean, baptiste, falcon, 1728, and, jacques, vaucanson, 1740, to, call, it, a, loom, is, a, misnomer, a, jacquard, head, could, be, attached, to, a, power, loom, or, a, handloom, the, head, controlling, which, warp, thread, was, raised, during, shedding, multiple, shuttles, could, be, used, to, control, the, colour, of, the, weft, during, picking, the, jacquard, loom, is, the, predecessor, to, the, computer, punched, card, readers, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, weft, may, be, passed, across, the, shed, as, a, ball, of, yarn, but, usually, this, is, too, bulky, and, unergonomic, shuttles, are, designed, to, be, slim, so, they, pass, through, the, shed, to, carry, a, lot, of, yarn, so, the, weaver, does, not, need, to, refill, them, too, often, and, to, be, an, ergonomic, size, and, shape, for, the, particular, weaver, loom, and, yarn, they, may, also, be, designed, for, low, friction, at, their, simplest, these, are, just, sticks, wrapped, with, yarn, they, may, be, specially, shaped, as, with, the, bobbins, and, bones, used, in, tapestry, making, bobbins, are, used, on, vertical, warps, and, bones, on, horizontal, ones, boat, shuttles, may, be, closed, central, hollow, with, a, solid, bottom, or, open, central, hole, goes, right, through, the, yarn, may, be, side, feed, or, end, feed, they, are, commonly, made, for, 10, cm, 4, inch, and, 15, cm, 6, inch, bobbin, lengths, hand, weavers, who, threw, a, shuttle, could, only, weave, a, cloth, as, wide, as, their, armspan, if, cloth, needed, to, be, wider, two, people, would, do, the, task, often, this, would, be, an, adult, with, a, child, john, kay, 1704, 1779, patented, the, flying, shuttle, in, 1733, the, weaver, held, a, picking, stick, that, was, attached, by, cords, to, a, device, at, both, ends, of, the, shed, with, a, flick, of, the, wrist, one, cord, was, pulled, and, the, shuttle, was, propelled, through, the, shed, to, the, other, end, with, considerable, force, speed, and, efficiency, a, flick, in, the, opposite, direction, and, the, shuttle, was, propelled, back, a, single, weaver, had, control, of, this, motion, but, the, flying, shuttle, could, weave, much, wider, fabric, than, an, arm, s, length, at, much, greater, speeds, than, had, been, achieved, with, the, hand, thrown, shuttle, the, flying, shuttle, was, one, of, the, key, developments, in, weaving, that, helped, fuel, the, industrial, revolution, the, whole, picking, motion, no, longer, relied, on, manual, skill, and, it, was, just, a, matter, of, time, before, it, could, be, powered, by, something, other, than, a, human, different, types, of, power, looms, are, most, often, defined, by, the, way, that, the, weft, or, pick, is, inserted, into, the, warp, many, advances, in, weft, insertion, have, been, made, in, order, to, make, manufactured, cloth, more, cost, effective, weft, insertion, rate, is, a, limiting, factor, in, production, speed, as, of, 2010, industrial, looms, can, weave, at, 2, 000, weft, insertions, per, minute, there, are, five, main, types, of, weft, insertion, and, they, are, as, follows, the, newest, weft, thread, must, be, beaten, against, the, fell, battening, can, be, done, with, a, long, stick, placed, in, the, shed, parallel, to, the, weft, a, sword, batten, a, shorter, stick, threaded, between, the, warp, threads, perpendicular, to, warp, and, weft, a, pin, batten, a, comb, or, a, reed, a, comb, with, both, ends, closed, so, that, it, has, to, be, sleyed, that, is, have, the, warp, threads, threaded, through, it, when, the, loom, is, warped, for, rigid, heddle, looms, the, heddle, may, be, used, as, a, reed, patented, in, 1802, dandy, looms, automatically, rolled, up, the, finished, cloth, keeping, the, fell, always, the, same, length, they, significantly, speeded, up, hand, weaving, still, a, major, part, of, the, textile, industry, in, the, 1800s, similar, mechanisms, were, used, in, power, looms, the, temples, act, to, keep, the, cloth, from, shrinking, sideways, as, it, is, woven, some, warp, weighted, looms, had, temples, made, of, loom, weights, suspended, by, strings, so, that, they, pulled, the, cloth, breadthwise, other, looms, may, have, temples, tied, to, the, frame, or, temples, that, are, hooks, with, an, adjustable, shaft, between, them, power, looms, may, use, temple, cylinders, pins, can, leave, a, series, of, holes, in, the, selvages, these, may, be, from, stenter, pins, used, in, post, processing, a, power, loom, is, a, loom, powered, by, a, source, of, energy, other, than, the, weaver, s, muscles, when, power, looms, were, developed, other, looms, came, to, be, referred, to, as, handlooms, most, cloth, is, now, woven, on, power, looms, but, some, is, still, woven, on, handlooms, the, development, of, power, looms, was, gradual, the, capabilities, of, power, looms, gradually, expanded, but, handlooms, remained, the, most, cost, effective, way, to, make, some, types, of, textiles, for, most, of, the, 1800s, many, improvements, in, loom, mechanisms, were, first, applied, to, hand, looms, like, the, dandy, loom, and, only, later, integrated, into, power, looms, edmund, cartwright, built, and, patented, a, power, loom, in, 1785, and, it, was, this, that, was, adopted, by, the, nascent, cotton, industry, in, england, the, silk, loom, made, by, jacques, vaucanson, in, 1745, operated, on, the, same, principles, but, was, not, developed, further, the, invention, of, the, flying, shuttle, by, john, kay, allow, a, hand, weaver, to, weave, broadwoven, cloth, without, an, assistant, and, was, also, critical, to, the, development, of, a, commercially, successful, power, loom, cartwright, s, loom, was, impractical, but, the, ideas, behind, it, were, developed, by, numerous, inventors, in, the, manchester, area, of, england, where, by, 1818, there, were, 32, factories, containing, 5, 732, looms, the, horrocks, loom, was, viable, but, it, was, the, roberts, loom, in, 1830, that, marked, the, turning, point, incremental, changes, to, the, three, motions, continued, to, be, made, the, problems, of, sizing, stop, motions, consistent, take, up, and, a, temple, to, maintain, the, width, remained, in, 1841, kenworthy, and, bullough, produced, the, lancashire, loom, which, was, self, acting, or, semi, automatic, this, enables, a, youngster, to, run, six, looms, at, the, same, time, thus, for, simple, calicos, the, power, loom, became, more, economical, to, run, than, the, handloom, with, complex, patterning, that, used, a, dobby, or, jacquard, head, jobs, were, still, put, out, to, handloom, weavers, until, the, 1870s, incremental, changes, were, made, such, as, the, dickinson, loom, culminating, in, the, keighley, born, inventor, northrop, who, was, working, for, the, draper, corporation, in, hopedale, producing, the, fully, automatic, northrop, loom, this, loom, recharged, the, shuttle, when, the, pirn, was, empty, the, draper, e, and, x, models, became, the, leading, products, from, 1909, they, were, challenged, by, synthetic, fibres, such, as, rayon, by, 1942, faster, more, efficient, and, shuttleless, sulzer, and, rapier, looms, had, been, introduced, the, loom, is, a, symbol, of, cosmic, creation, and, the, structure, upon, which, individual, destiny, is, woven, this, symbolism, is, encapsulated, in, the, classical, myth, of, arachne, who, was, changed, into, a, spider, by, the, goddess, athena, who, was, jealous, of, her, skill, at, the, godlike, craft, of, weaving, in, maya, civilization, the, goddess, ixchel, taught, the, first, woman, how, to, weave, at, the, beginning, of, time
