a, spear, is, a, polearm, consisting, of, a, shaft, usually, of, wood, with, a, pointed, head, the, head, may, be, simply, the, sharpened, end, of, the, shaft, itself, as, is, the, case, with, fire, hardened, spears, or, it, may, be, made, of, a, more, durable, material, fastened, to, the, shaft, such, as, bone, flint, obsidian, copper, bronze, iron, or, steel, the, most, common, design, for, hunting, and, or, warfare, since, ancient, times, has, incorporated, a, metal, spearhead, shaped, like, a, triangle, diamond, or, leaf, the, heads, of, fishing, spears, usually, feature, multiple, sharp, points, with, or, without, barbs, spears, can, be, divided, into, two, broad, categories, those, designed, for, thrusting, as, a, melee, weapon, including, weapons, such, as, lances, and, pikes, and, those, designed, for, throwing, as, a, ranged, weapon, usually, referred, to, as, javelins, the, spear, has, been, used, throughout, human, history, as, a, tool, for, hunting, and, or, fishing, and, as, a, weapon, along, with, the, club, knife, and, axe, it, is, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, widespread, tools, ever, developed, by, early, humans, as, a, weapon, it, may, be, wielded, with, either, one, or, two, hands, it, was, used, in, virtually, every, conflict, up, until, the, modern, era, where, even, to, this, day, it, lives, on, in, the, form, of, a, bayonet, fixed, onto, the, muzzle, of, a, long, gun, the, word, spear, comes, from, the, old, english, spere, from, the, proto, germanic, speri, from, a, proto, indo, european, root, sper, spear, pole, spear, manufacture, and, use, is, not, confined, to, humans, it, is, also, practiced, by, the, western, chimpanzee, chimpanzees, near, k, dougou, senegal, have, been, observed, to, create, spears, by, breaking, straight, limbs, off, trees, stripping, them, of, their, bark, and, side, branches, and, sharpening, one, end, with, their, teeth, they, then, used, the, weapons, to, hunt, galagos, sleeping, in, hollows, the, clacton, spear, found, in, england, and, the, sch, ningen, spears, found, in, present, day, germany, document, that, wooden, spears, have, been, used, for, hunting, since, at, least, 400, 000, years, ago, a, 2012, study, from, the, site, of, kathu, pan, in, south, africa, suggests, that, hominids, possibly, homo, heidelbergensis, may, have, developed, the, technology, of, hafted, stone, tipped, spears, in, africa, about, 500, 000, years, ago, wood, does, not, preserve, well, however, and, craig, stanford, a, primatologist, and, professor, of, anthropology, at, the, university, of, southern, california, has, suggested, that, the, discovery, of, spear, use, by, chimpanzees, means, that, early, humans, may, have, used, wooden, spears, before, this, from, circa, 200, 000, bc, onwards, middle, paleolithic, humans, began, to, make, complex, stone, blades, with, flaked, edges, which, were, used, as, spear, heads, these, stone, heads, could, be, fixed, to, the, spear, shaft, by, gum, or, resin, or, by, bindings, made, of, animal, sinew, leather, strips, or, vegetable, matter, during, this, period, a, clear, difference, remained, between, spears, designed, to, be, thrown, and, those, designed, to, be, used, in, hand, to, hand, combat, by, the, magdalenian, period, c, 15, 000, 9500, bc, spear, throwers, similar, to, the, later, atlatl, were, in, use, the, spear, is, the, main, weapon, of, the, warriors, of, homer, s, iliad, the, use, of, both, a, single, thrusting, spear, and, two, throwing, spears, are, mentioned, it, has, been, suggested, that, two, styles, of, combat, are, being, described, an, early, style, with, thrusting, spears, dating, to, the, mycenaean, period, in, which, the, iliad, is, set, and, anachronistically, a, later, style, with, throwing, spears, from, homer, s, own, archaic, period, in, the, 7th, century, bc, the, greeks, evolved, a, new, close, order, infantry, formation, the, phalanx, the, key, to, this, formation, was, the, hoplite, who, was, equipped, with, a, large, circular, bronze, faced, shield, aspis, and, a, 210, 270, cm, 7, 9, ft, spear, with, an, iron, head, and, bronze, butt, spike, doru, the, hoplite, phalanx, dominated, warfare, among, the, greek, city, states, from, the, 7th, into, the, 4th, century, bc, the, 4th, century, saw, major, changes, one, was, the, greater, use, of, peltasts, light, infantry, armed, with, spear, and, javelins, the, other, was, the, development, of, the, sarissa, a, two, handed, pike, 550, cm, 18, ft, in, length, by, the, macedonians, under, phillip, of, macedon, and, alexander, the, great, the, pike, phalanx, supported, by, peltasts, and, cavalry, became, the, dominant, mode, of, warfare, among, the, greeks, from, the, late, 4th, century, onward, until, greek, military, systems, were, supplanted, by, the, roman, legions, in, the, pre, marian, roman, armies, the, first, two, lines, of, battle, the, hastati, and, principes, often, fought, with, a, sword, called, a, gladius, and, pila, heavy, javelins, that, were, specifically, designed, to, be, thrown, at, an, enemy, to, pierce, and, foul, a, target, s, shield, originally, the, principes, were, armed, with, a, short, spear, called, a, hasta, but, these, gradually, fell, out, of, use, eventually, being, replaced, by, the, gladius, the, third, line, the, triarii, continued, to, use, the, hasta, from, the, late, 2nd, century, bc, all, legionaries, were, equipped, with, the, pilum, the, pilum, continued, to, be, the, standard, legionary, spear, until, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, ad, auxilia, however, were, equipped, with, a, simple, hasta, and, perhaps, javelins, or, darts, during, the, 3rd, century, ad, although, the, pilum, continued, to, be, used, legionaries, usually, were, equipped, with, other, forms, of, throwing, and, thrusting, spear, similar, to, auxilia, of, the, previous, century, by, the, 4th, century, the, pilum, had, effectively, disappeared, from, common, use, in, the, late, period, of, the, roman, empire, the, spear, became, more, often, used, because, of, its, anti, cavalry, capacities, as, the, barbarian, invasions, were, often, conducted, by, people, with, a, developed, culture, of, cavalry, in, warfare, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, spear, and, shield, continued, to, be, used, by, nearly, all, western, european, cultures, since, a, medieval, spear, required, only, a, small, amount, of, steel, along, the, sharpened, edges, most, of, the, spear, tip, was, wrought, iron, it, was, an, economical, weapon, quick, to, manufacture, and, needing, less, smithing, skill, than, a, sword, it, remained, the, main, weapon, of, the, common, soldier, the, vikings, for, instance, although, often, portrayed, with, an, axe, sword, or, lance, in, hand, were, armed, mostly, with, spears, as, were, their, anglo, saxon, irish, or, continental, contemporaries, spears, eventually, evolved, into, lances, this, is, where, the, lance, depiction, comes, from, with, a, good, majority, of, medieval, weapons, being, spears, they, became, integrated, into, many, war, tactics, spears, were, very, commonly, used, while, providing, a, defensive, block, when, men, on, horses, tried, to, get, by, these, blocks, they, would, often, be, killed, by, the, spears, that, could, poke, through, the, shield, walls, spears, became, more, common, than, swords, and, axes, because, of, how, cheap, long, and, fast, spears, were, made, broadly, speaking, spears, were, either, designed, to, be, used, in, melee, or, to, be, thrown, within, this, simple, classification, there, was, a, remarkable, range, of, types, for, example, m, j, swanton, identified, thirty, different, spearhead, categories, and, sub, categories, in, early, saxon, england, most, medieval, spearheads, were, generally, leaf, shaped, notable, types, of, early, medieval, spears, include, the, angon, a, throwing, spear, with, a, long, head, similar, to, the, roman, pilum, used, by, the, franks, and, anglo, saxons, and, the, winged, or, lugged, spear, which, had, two, prominent, wings, at, the, base, of, the, spearhead, either, to, prevent, the, spear, penetrating, too, far, into, an, enemy, or, to, aid, in, spear, fencing, originally, a, frankish, weapon, the, winged, spear, also, was, popular, with, the, vikings, it, would, become, the, ancestor, of, later, medieval, polearms, such, as, the, partisan, and, spetum, the, thrusting, spear, also, has, the, advantage, of, reach, being, considerably, longer, than, other, weapon, types, exact, spear, lengths, are, hard, to, deduce, as, few, spear, shafts, survive, archaeologically, but, 180, 240, cm, 6, 8, ft, would, seem, to, have, been, the, average, length, some, nations, were, noted, for, their, long, spears, including, the, scots, and, the, flemish, spears, usually, were, used, in, tightly, ordered, formations, such, as, the, shield, wall, or, the, schiltron, to, resist, cavalry, spear, shafts, could, be, planted, against, the, ground, william, wallace, drew, up, his, schiltrons, in, a, circle, at, the, battle, of, falkirk, in, 1298, to, deter, charging, cavalry, this, was, a, widespread, tactic, sometimes, known, as, the, crown, formation, thomas, randolph, 1st, earl, of, moray, used, a, circular, schiltron, on, the, first, day, of, the, battle, of, bannockburn, however, the, rectangular, schiltron, was, much, more, common, and, was, used, by, king, robert, the, bruce, on, the, second, day, of, the, battle, of, bannockburn, and, in, the, battle, of, old, byland, when, he, defeated, english, armies, throwing, spears, became, rarer, as, the, middle, ages, drew, on, but, survived, in, the, hands, of, specialists, such, as, the, catalan, almogavars, they, were, commonly, used, in, ireland, until, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, spears, began, to, lose, fashion, among, the, infantry, during, the, 14th, century, being, replaced, by, polearms, that, combined, the, thrusting, properties, of, the, spear, with, the, cutting, properties, of, the, axe, such, as, the, halberd, where, spears, were, retained, they, grew, in, length, eventually, evolving, into, pikes, which, would, be, a, dominant, infantry, weapon, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, cavalry, spears, were, originally, the, same, as, infantry, spears, and, were, often, used, with, two, hands, or, held, with, one, hand, overhead, in, the, 12th, century, after, the, adoption, of, stirrups, and, a, high, cantled, saddle, the, spear, became, a, decidedly, more, powerful, weapon, a, mounted, knight, would, secure, the, lance, by, holding, it, with, one, hand, and, tucking, it, under, the, armpit, the, couched, lance, technique, in, combination, with, a, lance, rest, this, allowed, all, the, momentum, of, the, horse, and, knight, to, be, focused, on, the, weapon, s, tip, whilst, still, retaining, accuracy, and, control, this, use, of, the, spear, spurred, the, development, of, the, lance, as, a, distinct, weapon, that, was, perfected, in, the, medieval, sport, of, jousting, in, the, 14th, century, tactical, developments, meant, that, knights, and, men, at, arms, often, fought, on, foot, this, led, to, the, practice, of, shortening, the, lance, to, about, 150, cm, 5, ft, to, make, it, more, manageable, as, dismounting, became, commonplace, specialist, polearms, such, as, the, pollaxe, were, adopted, by, knights, and, this, practice, ceased, the, development, of, both, the, long, two, handed, pike, and, gunpowder, firearms, in, renaissance, europe, saw, an, ever, increasing, focus, on, integrated, infantry, tactics, those, infantry, not, armed, with, these, weapons, carried, variations, on, the, polearm, including, the, halberd, and, the, bill, at, the, start, of, the, renaissance, cavalry, remained, predominantly, lance, armed, gendarmes, with, the, heavy, knightly, lance, and, lighter, cavalry, with, a, variety, of, lighter, lances, by, the, 1540s, however, pistol, armed, cavalry, called, reiters, were, beginning, to, make, their, mark, cavalry, armed, with, pistols, and, other, lighter, firearms, along, with, a, sword, had, virtually, replaced, lance, armed, cavalry, in, western, europe, by, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, ultimately, the, spear, proper, was, rendered, obsolete, on, the, battlefield, its, last, flowering, was, the, half, pike, or, spontoon, a, shortened, version, of, the, pike, carried, by, officers, of, various, ranks, while, originally, a, weapon, this, came, to, be, seen, more, as, a, badge, of, office, or, leading, staff, by, which, troops, were, directed, the, half, pike, sometimes, known, as, a, boarding, pike, was, also, used, as, a, weapon, on, board, ships, until, the, late, 19th, century, muslim, warriors, used, a, spear, that, was, called, an, az, za, yah, berbers, pronounced, it, za, ya, but, the, english, term, derived, from, the, old, french, via, berber, is, assegai, it, is, a, polearm, used, for, throwing, or, hurling, usually, a, light, spear, or, javelin, made, of, hard, wood, and, pointed, with, a, forged, iron, tip, the, az, za, yah, played, an, important, role, during, the, islamic, conquest, as, well, as, during, later, periods, well, into, the, 20th, century, a, longer, pole, az, za, yah, was, being, used, as, a, hunting, weapon, from, horseback, the, az, za, yah, was, widely, used, it, existed, in, various, forms, in, areas, stretching, from, southern, africa, to, the, indian, subcontinent, although, these, places, already, had, their, own, variants, of, the, spear, this, javelin, was, the, weapon, of, choice, during, the, fulani, jihad, as, well, as, during, the, mahdist, war, in, sudan, it, is, still, being, used, by, certain, wandering, sufi, ascetics, derwishes, in, the, chinese, martial, arts, the, chinese, spear, qiang, is, popularly, known, as, the, king, of, weapons, the, spear, is, listed, in, the, group, of, the, four, major, weapons, along, with, the, gun, staff, dao, a, single, edged, blade, similar, to, a, sabre, and, the, jian, sword, spears, were, used, first, as, hunting, weapons, amongst, the, ancient, chinese, they, became, popular, as, infantry, weapons, during, the, warring, states, and, qin, era, when, spearmen, were, used, as, especially, highly, disciplined, soldiers, in, organized, group, attacks, when, used, in, formation, fighting, spearmen, would, line, up, their, large, rectangular, or, circular, shields, in, a, shieldwall, manner, the, qin, also, employed, long, spears, more, akin, to, a, pike, in, formations, similar, to, swiss, pikemen, in, order, to, ward, off, cavalry, the, han, empire, would, use, similar, tactics, as, its, qin, predecessors, halberds, polearms, and, dagger, axes, were, also, common, weapons, during, this, time, spears, were, also, common, weaponry, for, warring, states, qin, and, han, era, cavalry, units, during, these, eras, the, spear, would, develop, into, a, longer, lance, like, weapon, used, for, cavalry, charges, there, are, many, words, in, chinese, that, would, be, classified, as, a, spear, in, english, the, mao, is, the, predecessor, of, the, qiang, the, first, bronze, mao, appeared, in, the, shang, dynasty, this, weapon, was, less, prominent, on, the, battlefield, than, the, ge, dagger, axe, in, some, archaeological, examples, two, tiny, holes, or, ears, can, be, found, in, the, blade, of, the, spearhead, near, the, socket, these, holes, were, presumably, used, to, attach, tassels, much, like, modern, day, wushu, spears, in, the, early, shang, the, mao, appeared, to, have, a, relatively, short, shaft, as, well, as, a, relatively, narrow, shaft, as, opposed, to, mao, in, the, later, shang, and, western, zhou, period, some, mao, from, this, era, are, heavily, decorated, as, is, evidenced, by, a, warring, states, period, mao, from, the, ba, shu, area, in, the, han, dynasty, the, mao, and, the, ji, ji, can, be, loosely, defined, as, a, halberd, rose, to, prominence, in, the, military, interesting, to, note, is, that, the, amount, of, iron, mao, heads, found, exceeds, the, number, of, bronze, heads, by, the, end, of, the, han, dynasty, eastern, han, the, process, of, replacement, of, the, iron, mao, had, been, completed, and, the, bronze, mao, had, been, rendered, completely, obsolete, after, the, han, dynasty, toward, the, sui, and, tang, dynasties, the, mao, used, by, cavalry, were, fitted, with, much, longer, shafts, as, is, mentioned, above, during, this, era, the, use, of, the, shuo, was, widespread, among, the, footmen, the, shuo, can, be, likened, to, a, pike, or, simply, a, long, spear, after, the, tang, dynasty, the, popularity, of, the, mao, declined, and, was, replaced, by, the, qiang, the, tang, dynasty, divided, the, qiang, in, four, categories, roughly, translated, the, four, categories, are, qi, a, kind, of, wood, spears, wooden, spears, bai, gan, a, kind, of, wood, spears, and, pu, tou, qiang, the, qiang, that, were, produced, in, the, song, and, ming, dynasties, consisted, of, four, major, parts, spearhead, shaft, end, spike, and, tassel, the, types, of, qiang, that, exist, are, many, among, the, types, there, are, cavalry, qiang, that, were, the, length, of, one, zhang, approximately, 320, cm, or, 10, ft, litte, flower, spears, xiao, hua, qiang, that, are, the, length, of, one, person, and, their, arm, extended, above, his, head, double, hooked, spears, single, hooked, spears, ringed, spears, and, many, more, there, is, some, confusion, as, to, how, to, distinguish, the, qiang, from, the, mao, as, they, are, obviously, very, similar, some, people, say, that, a, mao, is, longer, than, a, qiang, others, say, that, the, main, difference, is, between, the, stiffness, of, the, shaft, where, the, qiang, would, be, flexible, and, the, mao, would, be, stiff, scholars, seem, to, lean, toward, the, latter, explanation, more, than, the, former, because, of, the, difference, in, the, construction, of, the, mao, and, the, qiang, the, usage, is, also, different, though, there, is, no, definitive, answer, as, to, what, exactly, the, differences, are, between, the, mao, and, the, qiang, spears, are, known, as, bhala, in, indian, languages, spears, in, the, indian, society, were, used, both, in, missile, and, non, missile, form, both, by, cavalry, and, foot, soldiers, mounted, spear, fighting, was, practiced, using, with, a, 300, cm, 10, ft, ball, tipped, wooden, lance, called, a, bothati, the, end, of, which, was, covered, in, dye, so, that, hits, may, be, confirmed, spears, were, constructed, from, a, variety, of, materials, such, as, the, sang, made, completely, of, steel, and, the, ballam, which, had, a, bamboo, shaft, the, arab, presence, in, sindh, and, the, mameluks, of, delhi, introduced, the, middle, eastern, javelin, into, india, the, rajputs, wielded, a, type, of, spear, for, infantrymen, which, had, a, club, integrated, into, the, spearhead, and, a, pointed, butt, end, other, spears, had, forked, blades, several, spear, points, and, numerous, other, innovations, one, particular, spear, unique, to, india, was, the, vita, or, corded, lance, used, by, the, maratha, army, it, had, a, rope, connecting, the, spear, with, the, user, s, wrist, allowing, the, weapon, to, be, thrown, and, pulled, back, the, vel, is, a, type, of, spear, or, lance, originated, in, southern, india, primarily, used, by, tamils, sikh, nihangs, sometimes, carry, a, spear, even, today, spears, were, used, in, conflicts, and, training, by, armed, paramilitary, units, such, as, the, razakars, of, nizams, of, hyderabad, state, as, late, as, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, hoko, spear, was, used, in, ancient, japan, sometime, between, the, yayoi, period, and, the, heian, period, but, it, became, unpopular, as, early, samurai, often, acted, as, horseback, archers, medieval, japan, employed, spears, again, for, infantrymen, to, use, but, it, was, not, until, the, 11th, century, in, that, samurai, began, to, prefer, spears, over, bows, several, polearms, were, used, in, the, japanese, theatres, the, naginata, was, a, glaive, like, weapon, with, a, long, curved, blade, popularly, among, the, samurai, and, the, buddhist, warrior, monks, often, used, against, cavalry, the, yari, was, a, longer, polearm, with, a, straight, bladed, spearhead, which, became, the, weapon, of, choice, of, both, the, samurai, and, the, ashigaru, footmen, during, the, warring, states, era, the, horseback, samurai, used, shorter, yari, for, his, single, armed, combat, on, the, other, hand, ashigaru, infantries, used, long, yari, similar, with, european, pike, for, their, massed, combat, formation, filipino, spears, sibat, were, used, as, both, a, weapon, and, a, tool, throughout, the, philippines, it, is, also, called, a, bangkaw, after, the, bankaw, revolt, sumbling, or, palupad, in, the, islands, of, visayas, and, mindanao, sibat, are, typically, made, from, rattan, either, with, a, sharpened, tip, or, a, head, made, from, metal, these, heads, may, either, be, single, edged, double, edged, or, barbed, styles, vary, according, to, function, and, origin, for, example, a, sibat, designed, for, fishing, may, not, be, the, same, as, those, used, for, hunting, the, spear, was, used, as, the, primary, weapon, in, expeditions, and, battles, against, neighbouring, island, kingdoms, and, it, became, famous, during, the, 1521, battle, of, mactan, where, the, chieftain, lapu, lapu, of, cebu, fought, against, spanish, forces, led, by, ferdinand, magellan, who, was, subsequently, killed, the, various, types, of, the, assegai, a, light, spear, or, javelin, made, of, wood, and, pointed, with, iron, or, fire, hardened, tip, were, used, throughout, africa, and, it, was, the, most, common, weapon, used, before, the, introduction, of, firearms, the, zulu, xhosa, and, other, nguni, tribes, of, south, africa, were, renowned, for, their, use, of, the, assegai, shaka, of, the, zulu, invented, a, shorter, stabbing, spear, with, a, 30, cm, 1, ft, shaft, and, a, larger, broader, blade, one, foot, 0, 3m, long, this, weapon, is, otherwise, known, as, the, iklwa, or, ixwa, after, the, sound, that, was, heard, as, it, was, withdrawn, from, the, victim, s, wound, the, traditional, spear, was, not, abandoned, but, was, used, to, range, attack, enemy, formations, before, closing, in, for, close, quarters, battle, with, the, iklwa, this, tactical, combination, originated, during, shaka, s, military, reforms, this, weapon, was, typically, used, with, one, hand, while, the, off, hand, held, a, cowhide, shield, for, protection, similar, to, most, armies, of, their, period, ancient, egyptian, forces, were, centered, around, the, use, of, the, spear, in, battle, spearmen, would, be, armed, with, a, bronze, tipped, spear, dja, and, shield, ikem, which, were, used, in, elaborate, formations, much, like, greek, and, roman, forces, before, the, hyksos, invasion, into, egypt, wooden, spears, were, used, which, were, prone, to, splinter, but, the, influx, of, a, new, population, brought, innovations, around, bronze, technology, unlike, other, cultures, who, wielded, spears, at, this, time, the, egyptians, did, not, treat, their, javelins, around, 1, meter, to, 3, 3, feet, long, as, disposable, using, them, both, for, thrusting, and, throwing, as, advanced, metallurgy, was, largely, unknown, in, pre, columbian, america, outside, of, western, mexico, and, south, america, most, weapons, in, meso, america, were, made, of, wood, or, obsidian, this, did, not, mean, that, they, were, less, lethal, as, obsidian, may, be, sharpened, to, become, many, times, sharper, than, steel, meso, american, spears, varied, greatly, in, shape, and, size, while, the, aztecs, preferred, the, sword, like, macuahuitl, clubs, for, fighting, the, advantage, of, a, far, reaching, thrusting, weapon, was, recognised, and, a, large, portion, of, the, army, would, carry, the, tepoztopilli, into, battle, the, tepoztopilli, was, a, polearm, and, to, judge, from, depictions, in, various, aztec, codices, it, was, roughly, the, height, of, a, man, with, a, broad, wooden, head, about, twice, the, length, of, the, users, palm, or, shorter, edged, with, razor, sharp, obsidian, blades, which, were, deeply, set, in, grooves, carved, into, the, head, and, cemented, in, place, with, bitumen, or, plant, resin, as, an, adhesive, the, tepoztopilli, was, able, both, to, thrust, and, slash, effectively, throwing, spears, also, were, used, extensively, in, meso, american, warfare, usually, with, the, help, of,
