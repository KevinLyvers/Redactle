steelmaking, is, the, process, of, producing, steel, from, iron, ore, and, or, scrap, in, steelmaking, impurities, such, as, nitrogen, silicon, phosphorus, sulfur, and, excess, carbon, the, most, important, impurity, are, removed, from, the, sourced, iron, and, alloying, elements, such, as, manganese, nickel, chromium, carbon, and, vanadium, are, added, to, produce, different, grades, of, steel, steelmaking, has, existed, for, millennia, but, it, was, not, commercialized, on, a, massive, scale, until, the, mid, 19th, century, an, ancient, process, of, steelmaking, was, the, crucible, process, in, the, 1850s, and, 1860s, the, bessemer, process, and, the, siemens, martin, process, turned, steelmaking, into, a, heavy, industry, today, there, are, two, major, commercial, processes, for, making, steel, namely, basic, oxygen, steelmaking, which, has, liquid, pig, iron, from, the, blast, furnace, and, scrap, steel, as, the, main, feed, materials, and, electric, arc, furnace, eaf, steelmaking, which, uses, scrap, steel, or, direct, reduced, iron, dri, as, the, main, feed, materials, oxygen, steelmaking, is, fueled, predominantly, by, the, exothermic, nature, of, the, reactions, inside, the, vessel, in, contrast, in, eaf, steelmaking, electrical, energy, is, used, to, melt, the, solid, scrap, and, or, dri, materials, in, recent, times, eaf, steelmaking, technology, has, evolved, closer, to, oxygen, steelmaking, as, more, chemical, energy, is, introduced, into, the, process, steelmaking, is, one, of, the, most, carbon, emission, intensive, industries, in, the, world, as, of, 2020, steelmaking, is, responsible, for, about, 10, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, to, mitigate, global, warming, the, industry, will, need, to, find, significant, reductions, in, emissions, steelmaking, has, played, a, crucial, role, in, the, development, of, ancient, medieval, and, modern, technological, societies, early, processes, of, steel, making, were, made, during, the, classical, era, in, ancient, china, india, and, rome, cast, iron, is, a, hard, brittle, material, that, is, difficult, to, work, whereas, steel, is, malleable, relatively, easily, formed, and, a, versatile, material, for, much, of, human, history, steel, has, only, been, made, in, small, quantities, since, the, invention, of, the, bessemer, process, in, 19th, century, britain, and, subsequent, technological, developments, in, injection, technology, and, process, control, mass, production, of, steel, has, become, an, integral, part, of, the, global, economy, and, a, key, indicator, of, modern, technological, development, the, earliest, means, of, producing, steel, was, in, a, bloomery, early, modern, methods, of, producing, steel, were, often, labor, intensive, and, highly, skilled, arts, see, an, important, aspect, of, the, industrial, revolution, was, the, development, of, large, scale, methods, of, producing, forgeable, metal, bar, iron, or, steel, the, puddling, furnace, was, initially, a, means, of, producing, wrought, iron, but, was, later, applied, to, steel, production, the, real, revolution, in, modern, steelmaking, only, began, at, the, end, of, the, 1850s, when, the, bessemer, process, became, the, first, successful, method, of, steelmaking, in, high, quantity, followed, by, the, open, hearth, furnace, modern, steelmaking, processes, can, be, divided, into, three, steps, primary, secondary, and, tertiary, primary, steelmaking, involves, smelting, iron, into, steel, secondary, steelmaking, involves, adding, or, removing, other, elements, such, as, alloying, agents, and, dissolved, gases, tertiary, steelmaking, involves, casting, into, sheets, rolls, or, other, forms, multiple, techniques, are, available, for, each, step, basic, oxygen, steelmaking, is, a, method, of, primary, steelmaking, in, which, carbon, rich, pig, iron, is, melted, and, converted, into, steel, blowing, oxygen, through, molten, pig, iron, converts, some, of, the, carbon, in, the, iron, into, co, and, co, 2, turning, it, into, steel, refractories, calcium, oxide, and, magnesium, oxide, line, the, smelting, vessel, to, withstand, the, high, temperature, and, corrosive, nature, of, the, molten, metal, and, slag, the, chemistry, of, the, process, is, controlled, to, ensure, that, impurities, such, as, silicon, and, phosphorus, are, removed, from, the, metal, the, modern, process, was, developed, in, 1948, by, robert, durrer, as, a, refinement, of, the, bessemer, converter, that, replaced, air, with, more, efficient, oxygen, it, reduced, the, capital, cost, of, the, plants, and, smelting, time, and, increased, labor, productivity, between, 1920, and, 2000, labour, requirements, in, the, industry, decreased, by, a, factor, of, 1000, to, just, 0, 003, man, hours, per, tonne, in, 2013, 70, of, global, steel, output, was, produced, using, the, basic, oxygen, furnace, furnaces, can, convert, up, to, 350, tons, of, iron, into, steel, in, less, than, 40, minutes, compared, to, 10, 12, hours, in, an, open, hearth, furnace, electric, arc, furnace, steelmaking, is, the, manufacture, of, steel, from, scrap, or, direct, reduced, iron, melted, by, electric, arcs, in, an, electric, arc, furnace, a, batch, heat, of, iron, is, loaded, into, the, furnace, sometimes, with, a, hot, heel, molten, steel, from, a, previous, heat, gas, burners, may, be, used, to, assist, with, the, melt, as, in, basic, oxygen, steelmaking, fluxes, are, also, added, to, protect, the, lining, of, the, vessel, and, help, improve, the, removal, of, impurities, electric, arc, furnace, steelmaking, typically, uses, furnaces, of, capacity, around, 100, tonnes, that, produce, steel, every, 40, to, 50, minutes, this, process, allows, larger, alloy, additions, than, the, basic, oxygen, method, in, hisarna, ironmaking, process, iron, ore, is, processed, almost, directly, into, liquid, iron, or, hot, metal, the, process, is, based, around, a, type, of, blast, furnace, called, a, cyclone, converter, furnace, which, makes, it, possible, to, skip, the, process, of, manufacturing, pig, iron, pellets, that, is, necessary, for, the, basic, oxygen, steelmaking, process, without, the, necessity, of, this, preparatory, step, the, hisarna, process, is, more, energy, efficient, and, has, a, lower, carbon, footprint, than, traditional, steelmaking, processes, steel, can, be, produced, from, direct, reduced, iron, which, in, turn, can, be, produced, from, iron, ore, as, it, undergoes, chemical, reduction, with, hydrogen, renewable, hydrogen, allows, steelmaking, without, the, use, of, fossil, fuels, in, 2021, a, pilot, plant, in, sweden, tested, this, process, direct, reduction, occurs, at, 1, 500, f, 820, c, the, iron, is, infused, with, carbon, from, coal, in, an, electric, arc, furnace, hydrogen, produced, by, electrolysis, requires, approximately, 2600, kwh, per, ton, of, steel, costs, are, estimated, to, be, 20, 30, higher, than, conventional, methods, however, the, cost, of, co, 2, emissions, add, to, the, price, of, basic, oxygen, production, and, a, 2018, study, of, science, magazine, estimates, that, the, prices, will, break, even, when, that, price, is, 68, per, tonne, co, 2, which, is, expected, to, be, reached, in, the, 2030s, secondary, steelmaking, is, most, commonly, performed, in, ladles, some, of, the, operations, performed, in, ladles, include, de, oxidation, or, killing, vacuum, degassing, alloy, addition, inclusion, removal, inclusion, chemistry, modification, de, sulphurisation, and, homogenisation, it, is, now, common, to, perform, ladle, metallurgical, operations, in, gas, stirred, ladles, with, electric, arc, heating, in, the, lid, of, the, furnace, tight, control, of, ladle, metallurgy, is, associated, with, producing, high, grades, of, steel, in, which, the, tolerances, in, chemistry, and, consistency, are, narrow, as, of, 2021, steelmaking, is, estimated, to, be, responsible, for, around, 11, of, the, global, emissions, of, carbon, dioxide, and, around, 7, of, the, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, making, 1, ton, of, steel, emits, about, 1, 8, tons, of, carbon, dioxide, the, bulk, of, these, emissions, results, from, the, industrial, process, in, which, coal, is, used, as, the, source, of, carbon, that, removes, oxygen, from, iron, ore, in, the, following, chemical, reaction, which, occurs, in, a, blast, furnace, fe, 2, o, 3, s, 3, co, g, 2, fe, s, 3, co, 2, g, additional, carbon, dioxide, emissions, result, from, mining, refining, and, shipping, the, ore, used, basic, oxygen, steelmaking, calcination, and, the, hot, blast, carbon, capture, and, use, or, carbon, capture, and, storage, are, proposed, techniques, to, reduce, the, carbon, dioxide, emissions, in, the, steel, industry, and, reduction, of, iron, ore, using, green, hydrogen, rather, than, carbon, see, below, for, further, decarbonization, strategies, coal, and, iron, ore, mining, are, very, energy, intensive, and, result, in, numerous, environmental, damages, from, pollution, to, biodiversity, loss, deforestation, and, greenhouse, gas, emissions, iron, ore, is, shipped, great, distances, to, steel, mills, to, make, pure, steel, iron, and, carbon, are, needed, on, its, own, iron, is, not, very, strong, but, a, low, concentration, of, carbon, less, than, 1, percent, depending, on, the, kind, of, steel, gives, the, steel, its, important, properties, the, carbon, in, steel, is, obtained, from, coal, and, the, iron, from, iron, ore, however, iron, ore, is, a, mixture, of, iron, and, oxygen, and, other, trace, elements, to, make, steel, the, iron, needs, to, be, separated, from, the, oxygen, and, a, tiny, amount, of, carbon, needs, to, be, added, both, are, accomplished, by, melting, the, iron, ore, at, a, very, high, temperature, 1, 700, degrees, celsius, or, over, 3, 000, degrees, fahrenheit, in, the, presence, of, oxygen, from, the, air, and, a, type, of, coal, called, coke, at, those, temperatures, the, iron, ore, releases, its, oxygen, which, is, carried, away, by, the, carbon, from, the, coke, in, the, form, of, carbon, dioxide, fe, 2, o, 3, s, 3, co, g, 2, fe, s, 3, co, 2, g, the, reaction, occurs, due, to, the, lower, favorable, energy, state, of, carbon, dioxide, compared, to, iron, oxide, and, the, high, temperatures, are, needed, to, achieve, the, activation, energy, for, this, reaction, a, small, amount, of, carbon, bonds, with, the, iron, forming, pig, iron, which, is, an, intermediary, before, steel, as, it, has, carbon, content, that, is, too, high, around, 4, to, reduce, the, carbon, content, in, pig, iron, and, obtain, the, desired, carbon, content, of, steel, the, pig, iron, is, re, melted, and, oxygen, is, blown, through, in, a, process, called, basic, oxygen, steelmaking, which, occurs, in, a, ladle, in, this, step, the, oxygen, binds, with, the, undesired, carbon, carrying, it, away, in, the, form, of, carbon, dioxide, gas, an, additional, source, of, emissions, after, this, step, the, carbon, content, in, the, pig, iron, is, lowered, sufficiently, and, steel, is, obtained, further, carbon, dioxide, emissions, result, from, the, use, of, limestone, which, is, melted, at, high, temperatures, in, a, reaction, called, calcination, which, has, the, following, chemical, reaction, caco, 3, s, cao, s, co, 2, g, carbon, dioxide, is, an, additional, source, of, emissions, in, this, reaction, modern, industry, has, introduced, calcium, oxide, cao, quicklime, as, a, replacement, it, acts, as, a, chemical, flux, removing, impurities, such, as, sulfur, or, phosphorus, e, g, apatite, or, fluorapatite, in, the, form, of, slag, and, keeps, emissions, of, co, 2, low, for, example, the, calcium, oxide, can, react, to, remove, silicon, oxide, impurities, sio, 2, cao, casio, 3, this, use, of, limestone, to, provide, a, flux, occurs, both, in, the, blast, furnace, to, obtain, pig, iron, and, in, the, basic, oxygen, steel, making, to, obtain, steel, further, carbon, dioxide, emissions, result, from, the, hot, blast, which, is, used, to, increase, the, heat, of, the, blast, furnace, the, hot, blast, pumps, hot, air, into, the, blast, furnace, where, the, iron, ore, is, reduced, to, pig, iron, helping, to, achieve, the, high, activation, energy, the, hot, blast, temperature, can, be, from, 900, to, 1, 300, c, 1, 650, to, 2, 370, f, depending, on, the, stove, design, and, condition, oil, tar, natural, gas, powdered, coal, and, oxygen, can, also, be, injected, into, the, furnace, to, combine, with, the, coke, to, release, additional, energy, and, increase, the, percentage, of, reducing, gases, present, increasing, productivity, if, the, air, in, the, hot, blast, is, heated, by, burning, fossil, fuels, which, often, is, the, case, this, is, an, additional, source, of, carbon, dioxide, emissions, the, steel, industry, produces, 7, 8, of, co, 2, emissions, created, by, humans, almost, two, tonnes, for, every, tonne, of, steel, produced, and, it, is, one, of, the, most, energy, consuming, industries, on, earth, there, are, several, carbon, abatement, and, decarbonization, strategies, in, the, steelmaking, industry, which, on, the, basic, manufacturing, process, used, options, fall, into, three, general, categories, switching, the, energy, source, from, fossil, fuels, to, wind, and, solar, increasing, the, efficiency, of, processing, and, innovative, new, technological, processes, all, three, may, be, used, in, combination, green, steel, is, the, term, used, for, manufacturing, steel, without, the, use, of, fossil, fuels, that, is, zero, emission, products, however, not, all, companies, claiming, to, produce, green, steel, meet, this, criterion, some, merely, reduce, emissions, australia, produces, nearly, 40, of, the, world, s, iron, ore, and, the, government, via, the, australian, renewable, energy, agency, arena, is, helping, to, fund, many, research, projects, involving, direct, reduced, ironmaking, dri, to, increase, green, steel, and, iron, production, large, companies, such, as, rio, tinto, bhp, and, bluescope, are, developing, green, steel, projects, co, 2, emissions, vary, according, to, energy, sources, when, sustainable, energy, such, as, wind, or, solar, are, used, to, power, the, process, either, in, electric, arc, furnaces, or, to, create, hydrogen, as, a, fuel, emissions, can, be, reduced, dramatically, european, projects, from, hybrit, lkab, voestalpine, and, thyssenkrupp, are, pursuing, strategies, to, reduce, emissions, hybrit, claims, to, produce, true, green, steel, top, gas, from, the, blast, furnace, is, the, gas, that, is, normally, exhausted, into, the, air, during, steelmaking, this, gas, contains, co, 2, and, is, also, rich, in, the, reducing, agents, of, h, 2, and, co, the, top, gas, can, be, captured, the, co, 2, removed, and, the, reducing, agents, reinjected, into, the, blast, furnace, a, 2012, study, suggested, that, this, process, can, reduce, bf, co, 2, emissions, by, 75, while, a, 2017, study, showed, that, emissions, are, reduced, by, 56, 5, with, carbon, capture, and, storage, and, reduced, by, 26, 2, if, only, the, recycling, of, the, reducing, agents, is, used, to, keep, the, carbon, captured, from, entering, the, atmosphere, a, method, of, storing, it, or, using, it, would, have, to, be, found, another, way, to, use, the, top, gas, would, be, in, a, top, recovery, turbine, which, then, generates, electricity, which, could, be, used, to, reduce, the, energy, intensity, of, the, process, if, electric, arc, smelting, is, used, carbon, could, also, be, captured, from, gases, in, the, coke, oven, as, of, 2022, separating, the, co2, from, other, gases, and, components, in, the, system, and, the, high, cost, of, the, equipment, and, infrastructure, changes, needed, have, kept, this, strategy, minimal, but, the, potential, for, emission, reduction, has, been, estimated, to, be, up, to, 65, to, 80, alternatively, hydrogen, can, be, used, in, a, shaft, furnace, to, reduce, the, iron, oxides, only, water, is, produced, as, the, by, product, of, the, reaction, between, iron, oxide, and, hydrogen, and, results, in, emission, free, iron, making, known, as, hydrogen, direct, reduction, hdr, this, is, the, most, prominent, among, green, steel, technologies, this, differs, from, conventional, steel, making, processes, in, which, carbon, in, coke, is, used, as, the, reductant, to, strip, oxygen, from, iron, ore, which, creates, iron, and, carbon, dioxide, where, hydrogen, is, generated, from, a, renewable, energy, source, as, both, the, alternative, reductant, and, the, fuel, the, greatest, gain, in, co, 2, emissions, is, achieved, as, of, 2021, only, arcelormittal, in, france, voestalpine, in, austria, and, tata, in, the, netherlands, were, committed, to, using, green, hydrogen, to, make, steel, from, scratch, hdr, is, employed, in, the, hybrit, project, in, sweden, however, this, approach, requires, a, substantial, amount, of, renewables, to, produce, the, needed, renewable, hydrogen, for, the, european, union, it, is, estimated, that, the, hydrogen, demand, for, hydrogen, based, steelmaking, would, require, 180, gw, of, renewable, capacity, another, developing, possible, technology, is, iron, ore, electrolysis, where, the, reducing, agent, is, simply, electrons, as, opposed, to, h, 2, co, or, carbon, one, method, for, this, is, molten, oxide, electrolysis, here, the, cell, consists, of, an, inert, anode, a, liquid, oxide, electrolyte, cao, mgo, etc, and, the, molten, steel, when, heated, the, iron, ore, is, reduced, to, iron, and, oxygen, boston, metal, is, at, the, semi, industrial, stage, for, this, process, with, plans, to, reach, commercialization, by, 2026, expanding, a, pilot, plant, in, woburn, massachusetts, and, building, a, production, facility, in, brazil, it, was, founded, by, mit, professors, donald, sadoway, and, antoine, allanore, a, research, project, which, involved, the, steel, company, arcelormittal, tested, a, different, type, of, iron, ore, electrolysis, process, in, a, pilot, project, called, siderwin, it, operates, on, relatively, low, temperatures, around, 110, c, while, the, boston, metal, process, operates, on, high, temperatures, 1, 600, c, as, of, march, 2023, arcelormittal, is, investigating, whether, the, company, wants, scale, up, the, technology, and, build, a, larger, plant, and, expects, an, investment, decision, by, 2025, scrap, in, steelmaking, refers, to, steel, that, has, either, reached, its, end, of, life, use, or, was, generated, during, the, manufacture, of, steel, components, steel, is, easy, to, separate, and, recycle, due, to, its, inherent, magnetism, and, using, scrap, avoids, the, emissions, of, 1, 5, tons, of, co, 2, for, every, ton, of, scrap, used, as, of, 2023, steel, has, one, of, the, highest, recycling, rates, of, any, material, with, around, 30, of, the, world, s, steel, being, made, from, recycled, components, however, steel, cannot, be, recycled, forever, and, the, recycling, processes, using, arc, furnaces, use, electricity, in, the, blast, furnace, the, iron, oxides, are, reduced, by, a, combination, of, co, h, 2, and, carbon, only, around, 10, of, the, iron, oxides, are, reduced, by, h, 2, with, h, 2, enrichment, processing, the, proportion, of, iron, oxides, reduced, by, h, 2, is, increased, so, that, less, carbon, is, consumed, and, less, co, 2, is, emitted, this, process, can, reduce, emissions, by, an, estimated, 20, the, hisarna, ironmaking, process, was, described, above, as, a, way, of, producing, iron, in, a, cyclone, converter, furnace, without, the, pre, processing, steps, of, choking, agglomeration, which, reduces, the, co, 2, emissions, by, around, 20, one, speculative, idea, is, and, ongoing, project, by, susteel, to, develop, a, hydrogen, plasma, technology, that, reduces, the, oxides, with, hydrogen, as, opposed, to, with, co, or, carbon, and, melts, the, iron, at, high, operating, temperatures, in, steelmaking, coal, and, coke, are, used, for, fuel, and, iron, reduction, biomass, such, as, charcoal, or, wood, pellets, are, a, potential, alternative, fuel, but, this, does, not, actually, reduce, emissions, as, the, burning, biomass, still, emits, carbon, it, merely, provides, a, carbon, offset, where, emissions, are, traded, against, the, sequestration, of, the, source, biomass, ofsetting, emissions, by, 5, to, 28, of, current, co, 2, values, offsetting, has, a, very, low, reputation, globally, as, cutting, down, the, trees, to, create, the, pellets, or, charcoal, does, not, sequester, carbon, it, interrupts, the, natural, sequestration, the, tree, was, providing, offsetting, is, not, reduction, overall, there, are, a, number, of, innovative, methods, to, reduce, co, 2, emissions, within, the, steelmaking, industry, some, of, these, such, as, top, gas, recovery, and, using, hydrogen, reduction, in, dri, eaf, are, highly, feasible, with, current, infrastructure, and, technology, levels, others, such, as, hydrogen, plasma, and, iron, ore, electrolysis, are, still, in, the, research, or, semi, industrial, stage
