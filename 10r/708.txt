https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balloon_(aeronautics)
in, aeronautics, a, balloon, is, an, unpowered, aerostat, which, remains, aloft, or, floats, due, to, its, buoyancy, a, balloon, may, be, free, moving, with, the, wind, or, tethered, to, a, fixed, point, it, is, distinct, from, an, airship, which, is, a, powered, aerostat, that, can, propel, itself, through, the, air, in, a, controlled, manner, many, balloons, have, a, basket, gondola, or, capsule, suspended, beneath, the, main, envelope, for, carrying, people, or, equipment, including, cameras, and, telescopes, and, flight, control, mechanisms, aerostation, is, an, obsolete, term, referring, to, ballooning, and, the, construction, operation, and, navigation, of, lighter, than, air, vehicles, tiberius, cavallo, s, the, history, and, practice, of, aerostation, was, published, in, 1785, other, books, were, published, on, the, subject, including, by, monck, mason, dramatist, frederick, pilon, wrote, a, play, with, aerostation, as, its, title, a, balloon, is, conceptually, the, simplest, of, all, flying, machines, the, balloon, is, a, fabric, envelope, filled, with, a, gas, that, is, lighter, than, the, surrounding, atmosphere, as, the, entire, balloon, is, less, dense, than, its, surroundings, it, rises, taking, along, with, it, a, basket, attached, underneath, which, carries, passengers, or, payload, although, a, balloon, has, no, propulsion, system, a, degree, of, directional, control, is, possible, by, making, the, balloon, rise, or, sink, in, altitude, to, find, favorable, wind, directions, there, are, three, main, types, of, balloons, both, the, hot, air, or, montgolfi, re, balloon, and, the, gas, balloon, are, still, in, common, use, montgolfi, re, balloons, are, relatively, inexpensive, as, they, do, not, require, high, grade, materials, for, their, envelopes, and, they, are, popular, for, balloonist, sport, activity, the, first, balloon, which, carried, passengers, used, hot, air, to, obtain, buoyancy, and, was, built, by, the, brothers, joseph, and, etienne, montgolfier, in, annonay, france, in, 1783, the, first, passenger, flight, was, 19, september, 1783, carrying, a, sheep, a, duck, and, a, rooster, the, first, tethered, manned, balloon, flight, was, by, a, larger, montgolfier, balloon, probably, on, 15, october, 1783, the, first, free, balloon, flight, was, by, the, same, montgolfier, balloon, on, 21, november, 1783, when, heated, air, expands, so, a, given, volume, of, space, contains, less, air, this, makes, it, lighter, and, if, its, lifting, power, is, greater, than, the, weight, of, the, balloon, containing, it, it, will, lift, the, balloon, upwards, a, hot, air, balloon, can, only, stay, up, while, it, has, fuel, for, its, burner, to, keep, the, air, hot, enough, the, montgolfiers, early, hot, air, balloons, used, a, solid, fuel, brazier, which, proved, less, practical, than, the, hydrogen, balloons, that, had, followed, almost, immediately, and, hot, air, ballooning, soon, died, out, in, the, 1950s, the, convenience, and, low, cost, of, bottled, gas, burners, led, to, a, revival, of, hot, air, ballooning, for, sport, and, leisure, the, height, or, altitude, of, a, hot, air, balloon, is, controlled, by, turning, the, burner, up, or, down, as, needed, unlike, a, gas, balloon, where, ballast, weights, are, often, carried, so, that, they, can, be, dropped, if, the, balloon, gets, too, low, and, in, order, to, land, some, lifting, gas, must, be, vented, through, a, valve, a, man, carrying, balloon, using, the, light, gas, hydrogen, for, buoyancy, was, made, by, professor, jacques, charles, and, flown, less, than, a, month, after, the, montgolfier, flight, on, 1, december, 1783, gas, balloons, have, greater, lift, for, a, given, volume, so, they, do, not, need, to, be, so, large, and, they, can, also, stay, up, for, much, longer, than, hot, air, so, gas, balloons, dominated, ballooning, for, the, next, 200, years, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, common, to, use, manufactured, town, gas, coal, gas, to, fill, balloons, this, was, not, as, light, as, pure, hydrogen, gas, having, about, half, the, lifting, power, but, it, was, much, cheaper, and, readily, available, light, gas, balloons, are, predominant, in, scientific, applications, as, they, are, capable, of, reaching, much, higher, altitudes, for, much, longer, periods, of, time, they, are, generally, filled, with, helium, although, hydrogen, has, more, lifting, power, it, is, explosive, in, an, atmosphere, rich, in, oxygen, with, a, few, exceptions, scientific, balloon, missions, are, unmanned, there, are, two, types, of, light, gas, balloons, zero, pressure, and, superpressure, zero, pressure, balloons, are, the, traditional, form, of, light, gas, balloon, they, are, partially, inflated, with, the, light, gas, before, launch, with, the, gas, pressure, the, same, both, inside, and, outside, the, balloon, as, the, zero, pressure, balloon, rises, its, gas, expands, to, maintain, the, zero, pressure, difference, and, the, balloon, s, envelope, swells, at, night, the, gas, in, a, zero, pressure, balloon, cools, and, contracts, causing, the, balloon, to, sink, a, zero, pressure, balloon, can, only, maintain, altitude, by, releasing, gas, when, it, goes, too, high, where, the, expanding, gas, can, threaten, to, rupture, the, envelope, or, releasing, ballast, when, it, sinks, too, low, loss, of, gas, and, ballast, limits, the, endurance, of, zero, pressure, balloons, to, a, few, days, a, superpressure, balloon, in, contrast, has, a, tough, and, inelastic, envelope, that, is, filled, with, light, gas, to, pressure, higher, than, that, of, the, external, atmosphere, and, then, sealed, the, superpressure, balloon, cannot, change, size, greatly, and, so, maintains, a, generally, constant, volume, the, superpressure, balloon, maintains, an, altitude, of, constant, density, in, the, atmosphere, and, can, maintain, flight, until, gas, leakage, gradually, brings, it, down, superpressure, balloons, offer, flight, endurance, of, months, rather, than, days, in, fact, in, typical, operation, an, earth, based, superpressure, balloon, mission, is, ended, by, a, command, from, ground, control, to, open, the, envelope, rather, than, by, natural, leakage, of, gas, high, altitude, balloons, are, used, as, high, flying, vessels, to, carry, scientific, instruments, like, weather, balloons, or, reach, near, space, altitudes, to, take, footage, or, photos, of, the, earth, these, balloons, can, fly, over, 100, 000, feet, 30, 5, km, into, the, air, and, are, designed, to, burst, at, a, set, altitude, where, the, parachute, will, deploy, to, safely, carry, the, payload, back, to, earth, cluster, ballooning, uses, many, smaller, gas, filled, balloons, for, flight, early, hot, air, balloons, could, not, stay, up, for, very, long, because, they, used, a, lot, of, fuel, while, early, hydrogen, balloons, were, difficult, to, take, higher, or, lower, as, desired, because, the, aeronaut, could, only, vent, the, gas, or, drop, off, ballast, a, limited, number, of, times, pil, tre, de, rozier, realised, that, for, a, long, distance, flight, such, as, crossing, the, english, channel, the, aeronaut, would, need, to, make, use, of, the, differing, wind, directions, at, different, altitudes, it, would, be, essential, therefore, to, have, good, control, of, altitude, while, still, able, to, stay, up, for, a, long, time, he, developed, a, combination, balloon, having, two, gas, bags, the, rozier, balloon, the, upper, one, held, hydrogen, and, provided, most, of, the, steady, lift, the, lower, one, held, hot, air, and, could, be, quickly, heated, or, cooled, to, provide, the, varying, lift, for, good, altitude, control, in, 1785, pil, tre, de, rozier, took, off, in, an, attempt, to, fly, across, the, channel, but, shortly, into, the, flight, the, hydrogen, gas, bag, caught, fire, and, de, rozier, did, not, survive, the, ensuing, accident, this, earned, de, rozier, the, title, the, first, to, fly, and, the, first, to, die, it, wasn, t, until, the, 1980s, that, technology, was, developed, to, allow, safe, operation, of, the, rozier, type, for, example, by, using, non, flammable, helium, as, the, lifting, gas, and, several, designs, have, successfully, undertaken, long, distance, flights, as, an, alternative, to, free, flight, a, balloon, may, be, tethered, to, allow, reliable, take, off, and, landing, at, the, same, location, some, of, the, earliest, balloon, flights, were, tethered, for, safety, and, since, then, balloons, have, been, tethered, for, many, purposes, including, military, observation, and, aerial, barrage, meteorological, and, commercial, uses, the, natural, spherical, shape, of, a, balloon, is, unstable, in, high, winds, tethered, balloons, for, use, in, windy, conditions, are, often, stabilised, by, aerodynamic, shaping, and, connecting, to, the, tether, by, a, halter, arrangement, these, are, called, kite, balloons, a, kite, balloon, is, distinct, from, a, kytoon, which, obtains, a, portion, of, its, lift, aerodynamically, unmanned, hot, air, balloons, are, mentioned, in, chinese, history, zhuge, liang, of, the, shu, han, kingdom, in, the, three, kingdoms, era, 220, 280, ad, used, airborne, lanterns, for, military, signaling, these, lanterns, are, known, as, kongming, lanterns, the, mongolian, army, learned, of, the, kongming, lantern, from, the, chinese, and, used, it, in, battle, of, legnica, during, the, mongol, invasion, of, poland, in, 1709, the, brazilian, portuguese, cleric, bartolomeu, de, gusm, o, made, a, balloon, filled, with, heated, air, rise, inside, a, room, in, lisbon, on, august, 8, 1709, in, lisbon, gusm, o, managed, to, lift, a, small, balloon, made, of, paper, with, hot, air, about, four, meters, in, front, of, king, john, v, and, the, portuguese, court, he, also, claimed, to, have, built, a, balloon, named, passarola, big, bird, and, attempted, to, lift, himself, from, saint, george, castle, in, lisbon, landing, about, one, kilometre, away, however, the, claim, of, this, feat, remains, uncertain, even, though, there, is, record, of, this, flight, in, the, source, used, by, the, fai, the, exact, distance, and, conditions, of, the, flight, are, not, confirmed, following, henry, cavendish, s, 1766, work, on, hydrogen, joseph, black, proposed, that, a, balloon, filled, with, hydrogen, would, be, able, to, rise, in, the, air, the, first, recorded, manned, flight, was, made, in, a, hot, air, balloon, built, by, the, montgolfier, brothers, on, 21, november, 1783, the, flight, started, in, paris, and, reached, a, height, of, 500, feet, or, so, the, pilots, jean, fran, ois, pil, tre, de, rozier, and, fran, ois, laurent, d, arlandes, covered, about, 5, 5, miles, 8, 9, km, in, 25, minutes, on, 1, december, 1783, professor, jacques, charles, and, the, robert, brothers, made, the, first, gas, balloon, flight, also, from, paris, their, hydrogen, filled, balloon, flew, to, almost, 2, 000, feet, 600, m, stayed, aloft, for, over, 2, hours, and, covered, a, distance, of, 27, miles, 43, km, landing, in, the, small, town, of, nesles, la, vall, e, the, first, italian, balloon, ascent, was, made, by, count, paolo, andreani, and, two, other, passengers, in, a, balloon, designed, and, constructed, by, the, three, gerli, brothers, on, 25, february, 1784, a, public, demonstration, occurred, in, brugherio, a, few, days, later, on, 13, march, 1784, when, the, vehicle, flew, to, a, height, of, 1, 537, metres, 5, 043, ft, and, a, distance, of, 8, kilometres, 5, 0, mi, on, 28, march, andreani, received, a, standing, ovation, at, la, scala, and, later, a, medal, from, joseph, ii, holy, roman, emperor, de, rozier, together, with, joseph, proust, took, part, in, a, further, flight, on, 23, june, 1784, in, a, modified, version, of, the, montgolfiers, first, balloon, christened, la, marie, antoinette, after, the, queen, they, took, off, in, front, of, the, king, of, france, and, king, gustav, iii, of, sweden, the, balloon, flew, north, at, an, altitude, of, approximately, 3, 000, metres, above, the, clouds, travelling, 52, km, in, 45, minutes, before, cold, and, turbulence, forced, them, to, descend, past, luzarches, between, coye, et, orry, la, ville, near, the, chantilly, forest, the, first, balloon, ascent, in, britain, was, made, by, james, tytler, on, 25, august, 1784, at, edinburgh, scotland, in, a, hot, air, balloon, the, first, aircraft, disaster, occurred, in, may, 1785, when, the, town, of, tullamore, county, offaly, ireland, was, seriously, damaged, when, the, crash, of, a, balloon, resulted, in, a, fire, that, burned, down, about, 100, houses, making, the, town, home, to, the, world, s, first, aviation, disaster, to, this, day, the, town, shield, depicts, a, phoenix, rising, from, the, ashes, jean, pierre, blanchard, went, on, to, make, the, first, manned, flight, of, a, balloon, in, america, on, 9, january, 1793, after, touring, europe, to, set, the, record, for, the, first, balloon, flight, in, countries, including, the, austrian, netherlands, germany, the, netherlands, and, poland, his, hydrogen, filled, balloon, took, off, from, a, prison, yard, in, philadelphia, pennsylvania, the, flight, reached, 5, 800, feet, 1, 770, m, and, landed, in, gloucester, county, new, jersey, president, george, washington, was, among, the, guests, observing, the, takeoff, sophie, blanchard, married, to, jean, pierre, was, the, first, woman, to, pilot, her, own, balloon, and, the, first, woman, to, adopt, ballooning, as, a, career, on, 29, september, 1804, abraham, hopman, became, the, first, dutchman, to, make, a, successful, balloon, flight, in, the, netherlands, gas, balloons, became, the, most, common, type, from, the, 1790s, until, the, 1960s, the, french, military, observation, balloon, l, intr, pide, of, 1795, is, the, oldest, preserved, aircraft, in, europe, it, is, on, display, in, the, heeresgeschichtliches, museum, in, vienna, jules, verne, wrote, a, short, non, fiction, story, published, in, 1852, about, being, stranded, aboard, a, hydrogen, balloon, the, earliest, successful, balloon, flight, recorded, in, australia, was, by, william, dean, in, 1858, his, balloon, was, gas, filled, and, travelled, 30, km, with, two, people, aboard, on, 5, january, 1870, t, gale, made, an, ascent, from, the, domain, in, sydney, his, balloon, was, 17, metres, in, length, by, 31, metres, in, circumference, and, his, ascent, with, him, seated, on, the, netting, took, him, about, a, mile, before, he, landed, in, glebe, henri, giffard, also, developed, a, tethered, balloon, for, passengers, in, 1878, in, the, tuileries, garden, in, paris, the, first, tethered, balloon, in, modern, times, was, made, in, france, at, chantilly, castle, in, 1994, by, aerophile, sa, ballooning, developed, as, a, leisure, activity, it, was, given, a, significant, boost, when, charles, green, discovered, that, readily, available, coal, gas, then, coming, into, urban, use, gave, half, the, lifting, power, of, hydrogen, which, had, to, be, specially, manufactured, in, 1836, green, made, an, almost, 500, mile, long, distance, flight, from, london, england, to, weilberg, in, germany, the, first, military, use, of, a, balloon, was, at, the, battle, of, fleurus, in, 1794, when, l, entreprenant, was, used, by, the, french, aerostatic, corps, to, watch, the, movements, of, the, enemy, on, 2, april, 1794, an, aeronauts, corps, was, created, in, the, french, army, however, given, the, logistical, problems, linked, with, the, production, of, hydrogen, on, the, battlefield, it, required, constructing, ovens, and, pouring, water, on, white, hot, iron, the, corps, was, disbanded, in, 1799, the, first, major, use, of, balloons, in, the, military, occurred, during, the, american, civil, war, with, the, union, army, balloon, corps, established, in, 1861, during, the, paraguayan, war, 1864, 70, observation, balloons, were, used, by, the, brazilian, army, balloons, were, used, by, the, british, royal, engineers, in, 1885, for, reconnaissance, and, observation, purposes, during, the, bechuanaland, expedition, and, the, sudan, expedition, although, experiments, in, britain, had, been, conducted, as, early, as, 1863, a, school, of, ballooning, was, not, established, at, chatham, medway, kent, until, 1888, during, the, anglo, boer, war, 1899, 1902, use, was, made, of, observation, balloons, a, 11, 500, cubic, feet, 330, m, 3, balloon, was, kept, inflated, for, 22, days, and, marched, 165, miles, into, the, transvaal, with, the, british, forces, hydrogen, filled, balloons, were, widely, used, during, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, to, detect, enemy, troop, movements, and, to, direct, artillery, fire, observers, phoned, their, reports, to, officers, on, the, ground, who, then, relayed, the, information, to, those, who, needed, it, balloons, were, frequently, targets, of, opposing, aircraft, planes, assigned, to, attack, enemy, balloons, were, often, equipped, with, incendiary, bullets, for, the, purpose, of, igniting, the, hydrogen, the, aeronaut, badge, was, established, by, the, united, states, army, in, world, war, i, to, denote, service, members, who, were, qualified, balloon, pilots, observation, balloons, were, retained, well, after, the, great, war, being, used, in, the, russo, finnish, wars, the, winter, war, of, 1939, 40, and, the, continuation, war, of, 1941, 45, during, world, war, ii, the, japanese, launched, thousands, of, hydrogen, fire, balloons, against, the, united, states, and, canada, in, operation, outward, the, british, used, balloons, to, carry, incendiaries, to, nazi, germany, during, 2018, incendiary, balloons, and, kites, were, launched, from, gaza, at, israel, burning, some, 12, 000, dunams, 3, 000, acres, in, israel, large, helium, balloons, are, used, by, the, south, korean, government, and, private, activists, advocating, freedom, in, north, korea, they, float, hundreds, of, kilometers, across, the, border, carrying, news, from, the, outside, world, illegal, radios, foreign, currency, and, gifts, of, personal, hygiene, supplies, a, north, korean, military, official, has, described, it, as, psychological, warfare, and, threatened, to, attack, south, korea, if, their, release, continued, ed, yost, redesigned, the, hot, air, balloon, in, the, late, 1950s, using, rip, stop, nylon, fabrics, and, high, powered, propane, burners, to, create, the, modern, hot, air, balloon, his, first, flight, of, such, a, balloon, lasting, 25, minutes, and, covering, 3, miles, 5, km, occurred, on, 22, october, 1960, in, bruning, nebraska, yost, s, improved, design, for, hot, air, balloons, triggered, the, modern, sport, balloon, movement, today, hot, air, balloons, are, much, more, common, than, gas, balloons, in, the, late, 1970s, the, british, hot, air, balloonist, julian, nott, constructed, a, hot, air, balloon, using, technologies, he, believed, would, have, been, available, to, the, nazca, culture, of, peru, some, 1500, to, 2000, years, earlier, and, demonstrated, that, it, could, fly, and, again, in, 2003, nott, has, speculated, that, the, nazca, might, have, used, it, as, a, tool, for, designing, the, nazca, lines, nott, also, pioneered, the, use, of, hybrid, energy, where, solar, power, is, a, significant, heat, source, and, in, 1981, he, crossed, the, english, channel, in, 2012, the, red, bull, stratos, balloon, took, felix, baumgartner, to, 128, 100, ft, for, a, freefall, jump, from, the, stratosphere, tethered, gas, balloons, have, been, installed, as, amusement, rides, in, paris, since, 1999, in, berlin, since, 2000, in, disneyland, paris, since, 2005, in, the, san, diego, wild, animal, park, since, 2005, in, walt, disney, world, in, orlando, since, 2009, and, the, dhl, balloon, in, singapore, in, 2006, modern, tethered, gas, balloons, are, made, by, aerophile, sas, hot, air, balloons, used, in, sport, flying, are, sometimes, made, in, special, designs, to, advertise, a, company, or, product, such, as, the, chubb, fire, extinguisher, illustrated, a, balloon, in, space, uses, internal, gas, pressure, only, to, maintain, its, shape, the, echo, satellite, was, a, balloon, satellite, launched, into, earth,
