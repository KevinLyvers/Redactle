a, liquid, crystal, display, lcd, is, a, flat, panel, display, or, other, electronically, modulated, optical, device, that, uses, the, light, modulating, properties, of, liquid, crystals, combined, with, polarizers, liquid, crystals, do, not, emit, light, directly, but, instead, use, a, backlight, or, reflector, to, produce, images, in, color, or, monochrome, lcds, are, available, to, display, arbitrary, images, as, in, a, general, purpose, computer, display, or, fixed, images, with, low, information, content, which, can, be, displayed, or, hidden, preset, words, digits, and, seven, segment, displays, as, in, a, digital, clock, are, all, examples, of, devices, with, these, displays, they, use, the, same, basic, technology, except, that, arbitrary, images, are, made, from, a, matrix, of, small, pixels, while, other, displays, have, larger, elements, lcds, can, either, be, normally, on, positive, or, off, negative, depending, on, the, polarizer, arrangement, for, example, a, character, positive, lcd, with, a, backlight, will, have, black, lettering, on, a, background, that, is, the, color, of, the, backlight, and, a, character, negative, lcd, will, have, a, black, background, with, the, letters, being, of, the, same, color, as, the, backlight, lcds, are, used, in, a, wide, range, of, applications, including, lcd, televisions, computer, monitors, instrument, panels, aircraft, cockpit, displays, and, indoor, and, outdoor, signage, small, lcd, screens, are, common, in, lcd, projectors, and, portable, consumer, devices, such, as, digital, cameras, watches, calculators, and, mobile, telephones, including, smartphones, lcd, screens, have, replaced, heavy, bulky, and, less, energy, efficient, cathode, ray, tube, crt, displays, in, nearly, all, applications, the, phosphors, used, in, crts, make, them, vulnerable, to, image, burn, in, when, a, static, image, is, displayed, on, a, screen, for, a, long, time, e, g, the, table, frame, for, an, airline, flight, schedule, on, an, indoor, sign, lcds, do, not, have, this, weakness, but, are, still, susceptible, to, image, persistence, each, pixel, of, an, lcd, typically, consists, of, a, layer, of, molecules, aligned, between, two, transparent, electrodes, often, made, of, indium, tin, oxide, ito, and, two, polarizing, filters, parallel, and, perpendicular, polarizers, the, axes, of, transmission, of, which, are, in, most, of, the, cases, perpendicular, to, each, other, without, the, liquid, crystal, between, the, polarizing, filters, light, passing, through, the, first, filter, would, be, blocked, by, the, second, crossed, polarizer, before, an, electric, field, is, applied, the, orientation, of, the, liquid, crystal, molecules, is, determined, by, the, alignment, at, the, surfaces, of, electrodes, in, a, twisted, nematic, tn, device, the, surface, alignment, directions, at, the, two, electrodes, are, perpendicular, to, each, other, and, so, the, molecules, arrange, themselves, in, a, helical, structure, or, twist, this, induces, the, rotation, of, the, polarization, of, the, incident, light, and, the, device, appears, gray, if, the, applied, voltage, is, large, enough, the, liquid, crystal, molecules, in, the, center, of, the, layer, are, almost, completely, untwisted, and, the, polarization, of, the, incident, light, is, not, rotated, as, it, passes, through, the, liquid, crystal, layer, this, light, will, then, be, mainly, polarized, perpendicular, to, the, second, filter, and, thus, be, blocked, and, the, pixel, will, appear, black, by, controlling, the, voltage, applied, across, the, liquid, crystal, layer, in, each, pixel, light, can, be, allowed, to, pass, through, in, varying, amounts, thus, constituting, different, levels, of, gray, the, chemical, formula, of, the, liquid, crystals, used, in, lcds, may, vary, formulas, may, be, patented, an, example, is, a, mixture, of, 2, 4, alkoxyphenyl, 5, alkylpyrimidine, with, cyanobiphenyl, patented, by, merck, and, sharp, corporation, the, patent, that, covered, that, specific, mixture, expired, most, color, lcd, systems, use, the, same, technique, with, color, filters, used, to, generate, red, green, and, blue, subpixels, the, lcd, color, filters, are, made, with, a, photolithography, process, on, large, glass, sheets, that, are, later, glued, with, other, glass, sheets, containing, a, thin, film, transistor, tft, array, spacers, and, liquid, crystal, creating, several, color, lcds, that, are, then, cut, from, one, another, and, laminated, with, polarizer, sheets, red, green, blue, and, black, photoresists, resists, are, used, all, resists, contain, a, finely, ground, powdered, pigment, with, particles, being, just, 40, nanometers, across, the, black, resist, is, the, first, to, be, applied, this, will, create, a, black, grid, known, in, the, industry, as, a, black, matrix, that, will, separate, red, green, and, blue, subpixels, from, one, another, increasing, contrast, ratios, and, preventing, light, from, leaking, from, one, subpixel, onto, other, surrounding, subpixels, after, the, black, resist, has, been, dried, in, an, oven, and, exposed, to, uv, light, through, a, photomask, the, unexposed, areas, are, washed, away, creating, a, black, grid, then, the, same, process, is, repeated, with, the, remaining, resists, this, fills, the, holes, in, the, black, grid, with, their, corresponding, colored, resists, another, color, generation, method, used, in, early, color, pdas, and, some, calculators, was, done, by, varying, the, voltage, in, a, super, twisted, nematic, lcd, where, the, variable, twist, between, tighter, spaced, plates, causes, a, varying, double, refraction, birefringence, thus, changing, the, hue, they, were, typically, restricted, to, 3, colors, per, pixel, orange, green, and, blue, the, optical, effect, of, a, tn, device, in, the, voltage, on, state, is, far, less, dependent, on, variations, in, the, device, thickness, than, that, in, the, voltage, off, state, because, of, this, tn, displays, with, low, information, content, and, no, backlighting, are, usually, operated, between, crossed, polarizers, such, that, they, appear, bright, with, no, voltage, the, eye, is, much, more, sensitive, to, variations, in, the, dark, state, than, the, bright, state, as, most, of, 2010, era, lcds, are, used, in, television, sets, monitors, and, smartphones, they, have, high, resolution, matrix, arrays, of, pixels, to, display, arbitrary, images, using, backlighting, with, a, dark, background, when, no, image, is, displayed, different, arrangements, are, used, for, this, purpose, tn, lcds, are, operated, between, parallel, polarizers, whereas, ips, lcds, feature, crossed, polarizers, in, many, applications, ips, lcds, have, replaced, tn, lcds, particularly, in, smartphones, both, the, liquid, crystal, material, and, the, alignment, layer, material, contain, ionic, compounds, if, an, electric, field, of, one, particular, polarity, is, applied, for, a, long, period, of, time, this, ionic, material, is, attracted, to, the, surfaces, and, degrades, the, device, performance, this, is, avoided, either, by, applying, an, alternating, current, or, by, reversing, the, polarity, of, the, electric, field, as, the, device, is, addressed, the, response, of, the, liquid, crystal, layer, is, identical, regardless, of, the, polarity, of, the, applied, field, displays, for, a, small, number, of, individual, digits, or, fixed, symbols, as, in, digital, watches, and, pocket, calculators, can, be, implemented, with, independent, electrodes, for, each, segment, in, contrast, full, alphanumeric, or, variable, graphics, displays, are, usually, implemented, with, pixels, arranged, as, a, matrix, consisting, of, electrically, connected, rows, on, one, side, of, the, lc, layer, and, columns, on, the, other, side, which, makes, it, possible, to, address, each, pixel, at, the, intersections, the, general, method, of, matrix, addressing, consists, of, sequentially, addressing, one, side, of, the, matrix, for, example, by, selecting, the, rows, one, by, one, and, applying, the, picture, information, on, the, other, side, at, the, columns, row, by, row, for, details, on, the, various, matrix, addressing, schemes, see, passive, matrix, and, active, matrix, addressed, lcds, lcds, are, manufactured, in, cleanrooms, borrowing, techniques, from, semiconductor, manufacturing, and, using, large, sheets, of, glass, whose, size, has, increased, over, time, several, displays, are, manufactured, at, the, same, time, and, then, cut, from, the, sheet, of, glass, also, known, as, the, mother, glass, or, lcd, glass, substrate, the, increase, in, size, allows, more, displays, or, larger, displays, to, be, made, just, like, with, increasing, wafer, sizes, in, semiconductor, manufacturing, the, glass, sizes, are, as, follows, until, gen, 8, manufacturers, would, not, agree, on, a, single, mother, glass, size, and, as, a, result, different, manufacturers, would, use, slightly, different, glass, sizes, for, the, same, generation, some, manufacturers, have, adopted, gen, 8, 6, mother, glass, sheets, which, are, only, slightly, larger, than, gen, 8, 5, allowing, for, more, 50, and, 58, inch, lcds, to, be, made, per, mother, glass, specially, 58, inch, lcds, in, which, case, 6, can, be, produced, on, a, gen, 8, 6, mother, glass, vs, only, 3, on, a, gen, 8, 5, mother, glass, significantly, reducing, waste, the, thickness, of, the, mother, glass, also, increases, with, each, generation, so, larger, mother, glass, sizes, are, better, suited, for, larger, displays, an, lcd, module, lcm, is, a, ready, to, use, lcd, with, a, backlight, thus, a, factory, that, makes, lcd, modules, does, not, necessarily, make, lcds, it, may, only, assemble, them, into, the, modules, lcd, glass, substrates, are, made, by, companies, such, as, agc, inc, corning, inc, and, nippon, electric, glass, the, origin, and, the, complex, history, of, liquid, crystal, displays, from, the, perspective, of, an, insider, during, the, early, days, were, described, by, joseph, a, castellano, in, liquid, gold, the, story, of, liquid, crystal, displays, and, the, creation, of, an, industry, another, report, on, the, origins, and, history, of, lcd, from, a, different, perspective, until, 1991, has, been, published, by, hiroshi, kawamoto, available, at, the, ieee, history, center, a, description, of, swiss, contributions, to, lcd, developments, written, by, peter, j, wild, can, be, found, at, the, engineering, and, technology, history, wiki, in, 1888, friedrich, reinitzer, 1858, 1927, discovered, the, liquid, crystalline, nature, of, cholesterol, extracted, from, carrots, that, is, two, melting, points, and, generation, of, colors, and, published, his, findings, in, 1904, otto, lehmann, published, his, work, fl, ssige, kristalle, liquid, crystals, in, 1911, charles, mauguin, first, experimented, with, liquid, crystals, confined, between, plates, in, thin, layers, in, 1922, georges, friedel, described, the, structure, and, properties, of, liquid, crystals, and, classified, them, in, three, types, nematics, smectics, and, cholesterics, in, 1927, vsevolod, frederiks, devised, the, electrically, switched, light, valve, called, the, fr, edericksz, transition, the, essential, effect, of, all, lcd, technology, in, 1936, the, marconi, wireless, telegraph, company, patented, the, first, practical, application, of, the, technology, the, liquid, crystal, light, valve, in, 1962, the, first, major, english, language, publication, molecular, structure, and, properties, of, liquid, crystals, was, published, by, dr, george, w, gray, in, 1962, richard, williams, of, rca, found, that, liquid, crystals, had, some, interesting, electro, optic, characteristics, and, he, realized, an, electro, optical, effect, by, generating, stripe, patterns, in, a, thin, layer, of, liquid, crystal, material, by, the, application, of, a, voltage, this, effect, is, based, on, an, electro, hydrodynamic, instability, forming, what, are, now, called, williams, domains, inside, the, liquid, crystal, building, on, early, mosfets, paul, k, weimer, at, rca, developed, the, thin, film, transistor, tft, in, 1962, it, was, a, type, of, mosfet, distinct, from, the, standard, bulk, mosfet, in, 1964, george, h, heilmeier, who, was, working, at, the, rca, laboratories, on, the, effect, discovered, by, richard, williams, achieved, the, switching, of, colors, by, field, induced, realignment, of, dichroic, dyes, in, a, homeotropically, oriented, liquid, crystal, practical, problems, with, this, new, electro, optical, effect, made, heilmeier, continue, to, work, on, scattering, effects, in, liquid, crystals, and, finally, the, achievement, of, the, first, operational, liquid, crystal, display, based, on, what, he, called, the, dynamic, scattering, mode, dsm, application, of, a, voltage, to, a, dsm, display, switches, the, initially, clear, transparent, liquid, crystal, layer, into, a, milky, turbid, state, dsm, displays, could, be, operated, in, transmissive, and, in, reflective, mode, but, they, required, a, considerable, current, to, flow, for, their, operation, george, h, heilmeier, was, inducted, in, the, national, inventors, hall, of, fame, and, credited, with, the, invention, of, lcds, heilmeier, s, work, is, an, ieee, milestone, in, the, late, 1960s, pioneering, work, on, liquid, crystals, was, undertaken, by, the, uk, s, royal, radar, establishment, at, malvern, england, the, team, at, rre, supported, ongoing, work, by, george, william, gray, and, his, team, at, the, university, of, hull, who, ultimately, discovered, the, cyanobiphenyl, liquid, crystals, which, had, correct, stability, and, temperature, properties, for, application, in, lcds, the, idea, of, a, tft, based, liquid, crystal, display, lcd, was, conceived, by, bernard, lechner, of, rca, laboratories, in, 1968, lechner, f, j, marlowe, e, o, nester, and, j, tults, demonstrated, the, concept, in, 1968, with, an, 18x2, matrix, dynamic, scattering, mode, dsm, lcd, that, used, standard, discrete, mosfets, on, december, 4, 1970, the, twisted, nematic, field, effect, tn, in, liquid, crystals, was, filed, for, patent, by, hoffmann, laroche, in, switzerland, swiss, patent, no, 532, 261, archived, march, 9, 2021, at, the, wayback, machine, with, wolfgang, helfrich, and, martin, schadt, then, working, for, the, central, research, laboratories, listed, as, inventors, hoffmann, la, roche, licensed, the, invention, to, swiss, manufacturer, brown, boveri, cie, its, joint, venture, partner, at, that, time, which, produced, tn, displays, for, wristwatches, and, other, applications, during, the, 1970s, for, the, international, markets, including, the, japanese, electronics, industry, which, soon, produced, the, first, digital, quartz, wristwatches, with, tn, lcds, and, numerous, other, products, james, fergason, while, working, with, sardari, arora, and, alfred, saupe, at, kent, state, university, liquid, crystal, institute, filed, an, identical, patent, in, the, united, states, on, april, 22, 1971, in, 1971, the, company, of, fergason, ilixco, now, lxd, incorporated, produced, lcds, based, on, the, tn, effect, which, soon, superseded, the, poor, quality, dsm, types, due, to, improvements, of, lower, operating, voltages, and, lower, power, consumption, tetsuro, hama, and, izuhiko, nishimura, of, seiko, received, a, us, patent, dated, february, 1971, for, an, electronic, wristwatch, incorporating, a, tn, lcd, in, 1972, the, first, wristwatch, with, tn, lcd, was, launched, on, the, market, the, gruen, teletime, which, was, a, four, digit, display, watch, in, 1972, the, concept, of, the, active, matrix, thin, film, transistor, tft, liquid, crystal, display, panel, was, prototyped, in, the, united, states, by, t, peter, brody, s, team, at, westinghouse, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, in, 1973, brody, j, a, asars, and, g, d, dixon, at, westinghouse, research, laboratories, demonstrated, the, first, thin, film, transistor, liquid, crystal, display, tft, lcd, as, of, 2013, all, modern, high, resolution, and, high, quality, electronic, visual, display, devices, use, tft, based, active, matrix, displays, brody, and, fang, chen, luo, demonstrated, the, first, flat, active, matrix, liquid, crystal, display, am, lcd, in, 1974, and, then, brody, coined, the, term, active, matrix, in, 1975, in, 1972, north, american, rockwell, microelectronics, corp, introduced, the, use, of, dsm, lcds, for, calculators, for, marketing, by, lloyds, electronics, inc, though, these, required, an, internal, light, source, for, illumination, sharp, corporation, followed, with, dsm, lcds, for, pocket, sized, calculators, in, 1973, and, then, mass, produced, tn, lcds, for, watches, in, 1975, other, japanese, companies, soon, took, a, leading, position, in, the, wristwatch, market, like, seiko, and, its, first, 6, digit, tn, lcd, quartz, wristwatch, and, casio, s, casiotron, color, lcds, based, on, guest, host, interaction, were, invented, by, a, team, at, rca, in, 1968, a, particular, type, of, such, a, color, lcd, was, developed, by, japan, s, sharp, corporation, in, the, 1970s, receiving, patents, for, their, inventions, such, as, a, patent, by, shinji, kato, and, takaaki, miyazaki, in, may, 1975, and, then, improved, by, fumiaki, funada, and, masataka, matsuura, in, december, 1975, tft, lcds, similar, to, the, prototypes, developed, by, a, westinghouse, team, in, 1972, were, patented, in, 1976, by, a, team, at, sharp, consisting, of, fumiaki, funada, masataka, matsuura, and, tomio, wada, then, improved, in, 1977, by, a, sharp, team, consisting, of, kohei, kishi, hirosaku, nonomura, keiichiro, shimizu, and, tomio, wada, however, these, tft, lcds, were, not, yet, ready, for, use, in, products, as, problems, with, the, materials, for, the, tfts, were, not, yet, solved, in, 1983, researchers, at, brown, boveri, cie, bbc, research, center, switzerland, invented, the, super, twisted, nematic, stn, structure, for, passive, matrix, addressed, lcds, h, amstutz, et, al, were, listed, as, inventors, in, the, corresponding, patent, applications, filed, in,

brown, boveri, started, a, 50, 50, joint, venture, with, the, dutch, philips, company, called, videlec, philips, had, the, required, know, how, to, design, and, build, integrated, circuits, for, the, control, of, large, lcd, panels, in, addition, philips, had, better, access, to, markets, for, electronic, components, and, intended, to, use, lcds, in, new, product, generations, of, hi, fi, video, equipment, and, telephones, in, 1984, philips, researchers, theodorus, welzen, and, adrianus, de, vaan, invented, a, video, speed, drive, scheme, that, solved, the, slow, response, time, of, stn, lcds, enabling, high, resolution, high, quality, and, smooth, moving, video, images, on, stn, lcds, in, 1985, philips, inventors, theodorus, welzen, and, adrianus, de, vaan, solved, the, problem, of, driving, high, resolution, stn, lcds, using, low, voltage, cmos, based, drive, electronics, allowing, the, application, of, high, quality, high, resolution, and, video, speed, lcd, panels, in, battery, operated, portable, products, like, notebook, computers, and, mobile, phones, in, 1985, philips, acquired, 100, of, the, videlec, ag, company, based, in, switzerland, afterwards, philips, moved, the, videlec, production, lines, to, the, netherlands, years, later, philips, successfully, produced, and, marketed, complete, modules, consisting, of, the, lcd, screen, microphone, speakers, etc, in, high, volume, production, for, the, booming, mobile, phone, industry, the, first, color, lcd, televisions, were, developed, as, handheld, televisions, in, japan, in, 1980, hattori, seiko, s, r, d, group, began, development, on, color, lcd, pocket, televisions, in, 1982, seiko, epson, released, the, first, lcd, television, the, epson, tv, watch, a, wristwatch, equipped, with, a, small, active, matrix, lcd, television, sharp, corporation, introduced, dot, matrix, tn, lcd, in, 1983, in, 1984, epson, released, the, et, 10, the, first, full, color, pocket, lcd, television, the, same, year, citizen, watch, introduced, the, citizen, pocket, tv, a, 2, 7, inch, color, lcd, tv, with, the, first, commercial, tft, lcd, in, 1988, sharp, demonstrated, a, 14, inch, active, matrix, full, color, full, motion, tft, lcd, this, led, to, japan, launching, an, lcd, industry, which, developed, large, size, lcds, including, tft, computer, monitors, and, lcd, televisions, epson, developed, the, 3lcd, projection, technology, in, the, 1980s, and, licensed, it, for, use, in, projectors, in, 1988, epson, s, vpj, 700, released, in, january, 1989, was, the, world, s, first, compact, full, color, lcd, projector, in, 1990, under, different, titles, inventors, conceived, electro, optical, effects, as, alternatives, to, twisted, nematic, field, effect, lcds, tn, and, stn, lcds, one, approach, was, to, use, interdigital, electrodes, on, one, glass, substrate, only, to, produce, an, electric, field, essentially, parallel, to, the, glass, substrates, to, take, full, advantage, of, the, properties, of, this, in, plane, switching, ips, technology, further, work, was, needed, after, thorough, analysis, details, of, advantageous, embodiments, are, filed, in, germany, by, guenter, baur, et, al, and, patented, in, various, countries, the, fraunhofer, institute, ise, in, freiburg, where, the, inventors, worked, assigns, these, patents, to, merck, kgaa, darmstadt, a, supplier, of, lc, substances, in, 1992, shortly, thereafter, engineers, at, hitachi, work, out, various, practical, details, of, the, ips, technology, to, interconnect, the, thin, film, transistor, array, as, a, matrix, and, to, avoid, undesirable, stray, fields, in, between, pixels, the, first, wall, mountable, lcd, tv, was, introduced, by, sharp, corporation, in, 1992, hitachi, also, improved, the, viewing, angle, dependence, further, by, optimizing, the, shape, of, the, electrodes, super, ips, nec, and, hitachi, become, early, manufacturers, of, active, matrix, addressed, lcds, based, on, the, ips, technology, this, is, a, milestone, for, implementing, large, screen, lcds, having, acceptable, visual, performance, for, flat, panel, computer, monitors, and, television, screens, in, 1996, samsung, developed, the, optical, patterning, technique, that, enables, multi, domain, lcd, multi, domain, and, in, plane, switching, subsequently, remain, the, dominant, lcd, designs, through, 2006, in, the, late, 1990s, the, lcd, industry, began, shifting, away, from, japan, towards, south, korea, and, taiwan, and, later, on, towards, china, in, 2007, the, image, quality, of, lcd, televisions, surpassed, the, image, quality, of, cathode, ray, tube, based, crt, tvs, in, the, fourth, quarter, of, 2007, lcd, televisions, surpassed, crt, tvs, in, worldwide, sales, for, the, first, time, lcd, tvs, were, projected, to, account, 50, of, the, 200, million, tvs, to, be, shipped, globally, in, 2006, according, to, displaybank, in, october, 2011, toshiba, announced, 2560, 1600, pixels, on, a, 6, 1, inch, 155, mm, lcd, panel, suitable, for, use, in, a, tablet, computer, especially, for, chinese, character, display, the, 2010s, also, saw, the, wide, adoption, of, tgp, tracking, gate, line, in, pixel, which, moves, the, driving, circuitry, from, the, borders, of, the, display, to, in, between, the, pixels, allowing, for, narrow, bezels, in, 2016, panasonic, developed, ips, lcds, with, a, contrast, ratio, of, 1, 000, 000, 1, rivaling, oleds, this, technology, was, later, put, into, mass, production, as, dual, layer, dual, panel, or, lmcl, light, modulating, cell, layer, lcds, the, technology, uses, 2, liquid, crystal, layers, instead, of, one, and, may, be, used, along, with, a, mini, led, backlight, and, quantum, dot, sheets, since, lcds, produce, no, light, of, their, own, they, require, external, light, to, produce, a, visible, image, in, a, transmissive, type, of, lcd, the, light, source, is, provided, at, the, back, of, the, glass, stack, and, is, called, a, backlight, active, matrix, lcds, are, almost, always, backlit, passive, lcds, may, be, backlit, but, many, are, reflective, as, they, use, a, use, a, reflective, surface, or, film, at, the, back, of, the, glass, stack, to, utilize, ambient, light, transflective, lcds, combine, the, features, of, a, backlit, transmissive, display, and, a, reflective, display, the, common, implementations, of, lcd, backlight, technology, are, today, most, lcd, screens, are, being, designed, with, an, led, backlight, instead, of, the, traditional, ccfl, backlight, while, that, backlight, is, dynamically, controlled, with, the, video, information, dynamic, backlight, control, the, combination, with, the, dynamic, backlight, control, invented, by, philips, researchers, douglas, stanton, martinus, stroomer, and, adrianus, de, vaan, simultaneously, increases, the, dynamic, range, of, the, display, system, also, marketed, as, hdr, high, dynamic, range, television, or, flad, full, area, local, area, dimming, the, lcd, backlight, systems, are, made, highly, efficient, by, applying, optical, films, such, as, prismatic, structure, prism, sheet, to, gain, the, light, into, the, desired, viewer, directions, and, reflective, polarizing, films, that, recycle, the, polarized, light, that, was, formerly, absorbed, by, the, first, polarizer, of, the, lcd, invented, by, philips, researchers, adrianus, de, vaan, and, paulus, schaareman, generally, achieved, using, so, called, dbef, films, manufactured, and, supplied, by, 3m, improved, versions, of, the, prism, sheet, have, a, wavy, rather, than, a, prismatic, structure, and, introduce, waves, laterally, into, the, structure, of, the, sheet, while, also, varying, the, height, of, the, waves, directing, even, more, light, towards, the, screen, and, reducing, aliasing, or, moir, between, the, structure, of, the, prism, sheet, and, the, subpixels, of, the, lcd, a, wavy, structure, is, easier, to, mass, produce, than, a, prismatic, one, using, conventional, diamond, machine, tools, which, are, used, to, make, the, rollers, used, to, imprint, the, wavy, structure, into, plastic, sheets, thus, producing, prism, sheets, a, diffuser, sheet, is, placed, on, both, sides, of, the, prism, sheet, to, distribute, the, light, of, the, backlight, uniformly, while, a, mirror, is, placed, behind, the, light, guide, plate, to, direct, all, light, forwards, the, prism, sheet, with, its, diffuser, sheets, are, placed, on, top, of, the, light, guide, plate, the, dbef, polarizers, consist, of, a, large, stack, of, uniaxial, oriented, birefringent, films, that, reflect, the, former, absorbed, polarization, mode, of, the, light, such, reflective, polarizers, using, uniaxial, oriented, polymerized, liquid, crystals, birefringent, polymers, or, birefringent, glue, are, invented, in, 1989, by, philips, researchers, dirk, broer, adrianus, de, vaan, and, joerg, brambring, the, combination, of, such, reflective, polarizers, and, led, dynamic, backlight, control, make, today, s, lcd, televisions, far, more, efficient, than, the, crt, based, sets, leading, to, a, worldwide, energy, saving, of, 600, twh, 2017, equal, to, 10, of, the, electricity, consumption, of, all, households, worldwide, or, equal, to, 2, times, the, energy, production, of, all, solar, cells, in, the, world, a, standard, television, receiver, screen, a, modern, lcd, panel, has, over, six, million, pixels, and, they, are, all, individually, powered, by, a, wire, network, embedded, in, the, screen, the, fine, wires, or, pathways, form, a, grid, with, vertical, wires, across, the, whole, screen, on, one, side, of, the, screen, and, horizontal, wires, across, the, whole, screen, on, the, other, side, of, the, screen, to, this, grid, each, pixel, has, a, positive, connection, on, one, side, and, a, negative, connection, on, the, other, side, so, the, total, amount, of, wires, needed, for, a, 1080p, display, is, 3, x, 1920, going, vertically, and, 1080, going, horizontally, for, a, total, of, 6840, wires, horizontally, and, vertically, that, s, three, for, red, green, and, blue, and, 1920, columns, of, pixels, for, each, color, for, a, total, of, 5760, wires, going, vertically, and, 1080, rows, of, wires, going, horizontally, for, a, panel, that, is, 28, 8, inches, 73, centimeters, wide, that, means, a, wire, density, of, 200, wires, per, inch, along, the, horizontal, edge, the, lcd, panel, is, powered, by, lcd, drivers, that, are, carefully, matched, up, with, the, edge, of, the, lcd, panel, at, the, factory, level, the, drivers, may, be, installed, using, several, methods, the, most, common, of, which, are, cog, chip, on, glass, and, tab, tape, automated, bonding, these, same, principles, apply, also, for, smartphone, screens, that, are, much, smaller, than, tv, screens, lcd, panels, typically, use, thinly, coated, metallic, conductive, pathways, on, a, glass, substrate, to, form, the, cell, circuitry, to, operate, the, panel, it, is, usually, not, possible, to, use, soldering, techniques, to, directly, connect, the, panel, to, a, separate, copper, etched, circuit, board, instead, interfacing, is, accomplished, using, anisotropic, conductive, film, or, for, lower, densities, elastomeric, connectors, monochrome, and, later, color, passive, matrix, lcds, were, standard, in, most, early, laptops, although, a, few, used, plasma, displays, and, the, original, nintendo, game, boy, until, the, mid, 1990s, when, color, active, matrix, became, standard, on, all, laptops, the, commercially, unsuccessful, macintosh, portable, released, in, 1989, was, one, of, the, first, to, use, an, active, matrix, display, though, still, monochrome, passive, matrix, lcds, are, still, used, in, the, 2010s, for, applications, less, demanding, than, laptop, computers, and, tvs, such, as, inexpensive, calculators, in, particular, these, are, used, on, portable, devices, where, less, information, content, needs, to, be, displayed, lowest, power, consumption, no, backlight, and, low, cost, are, desired, or, readability, in, direct, sunlight, is, needed, displays, having, a, passive, matrix, structure, are, employing, super, twisted, nematic, stn, invented, by, brown, boveri, research, center, baden, switzerland, in, 1983, scientific, details, were, published, or, double, layer, stn, dstn, technology, the, latter, of, which, addresses, a, color, shifting, problem, with, the, former, and, color, stn, cstn, in, which, color, is, added, by, using, an, internal, color, filter, stn, lcds, have, been, optimized, for, passive, matrix, addressing, they, exhibit, a, sharper, threshold, of, the, contrast, vs, voltage, characteristic, than, the, original, tn, lcds, this, is, important, because, pixels, are, subjected, to, partial, voltages, even, while, not, selected, crosstalk, between, activated, and, non, activated, pixels, has, to, be, handled, properly, by, keeping, the, rms, voltage, of, non, activated, pixels, below, the, threshold, voltage, as, discovered, by, peter, j, wild, in, 1972, while, activated, pixels, are, subjected, to, voltages, above, threshold, the, voltages, according, to, the, alt, pleshko, drive, scheme, driving, such, stn, displays, according, to, the, alt, pleshko, drive, scheme, require, very, high, line, addressing, voltages, welzen, and, de, vaan, invented, an, alternative, drive, scheme, a, non, alt, pleshko, drive, scheme, requiring, much, lower, voltages, such, that, the, stn, display, could, be, driven, using, low, voltage, cmos, technologies, white, on, blue, lcds, are, stn, and, can, use, a, blue, polarizer, or, birefringence, which, gives, them, their, distinctive, appearance, stn, lcds, have, to, be, continuously, refreshed, by, alternating, pulsed, voltages, of, one, polarity, during, one, frame, and, pulses, of, opposite, polarity, during, the, next, frame, individual, pixels, are, addressed, by, the, corresponding, row, and, column, circuits, this, type, of, display, is, called, passive, matrix, addressed, because, the, pixel, must, retain, its, state, between, refreshes, without, the, benefit, of, a, steady, electrical, charge, as, the, number, of, pixels, and, correspondingly, columns, and, rows, increases, this, type, of, display, becomes, less, feasible, slow, response, times, and, poor, contrast, are, typical, of, passive, matrix, addressed, lcds, with, too, many, pixels, and, driven, according, to, the, alt, pleshko, drive, scheme, welzen, and, de, vaan, also, invented, a, non, rms, drive, scheme, enabling, to, drive, stn, displays, with, video, rates, and, enabling, to, show, smooth, moving, video, images, on, an, stn, display, citizen, among, others, licensed, these, patents, and, successfully, introduced, several, stn, based, lcd, pocket, televisions, on, the, market, bistable, lcds, do, not, require, continuous, refreshing, rewriting, is, only, required, for, picture, information, changes, in, 1984, ha, van, sprang, and, ajsm, de, vaan, invented, an, stn, type, display, that, could, be, operated, in, a, bistable, mode, enabling, extremely, high, resolution, images, up, to, 4000, lines, or, more, using, only, low, voltages, since, a, pixel, may, be, either, in, an, on, state, or, in, an, off, state, at, the, moment, new, information, needs, to, be, written, to, that, particular, pixel, the, addressing, method, of, these, bistable, displays, is, rather, complex, a, reason, why, these, displays, did, not, made, it, to, the, market, that, changed, when, in, the, 2010, zero, power, bistable, lcds, became, available, potentially, passive, matrix, addressing, can, be, used, with, devices, if, their, write, erase, characteristics, are, suitable, which, was, the, case, for, ebooks, which, need, to, show, still, pictures, only, after, a, page, is, written, to, the, display, the, display, may, be, cut, from, the, power, while, retaining, readable, images, this, has, the, advantage, that, such, ebooks, may, be, operated, for, long, periods, of, time, powered, by, only, a, small, battery, high, resolution, color, displays, such, as, modern, lcd, computer, monitors, and, televisions, use, an, active, matrix, structure, a, matrix, of, thin, film, transistors, tfts, is, added, to, the, electrodes, in, contact, with, the, lc, layer, each, pixel, has, its, own, dedicated, transistor, allowing, each, column, line, to, access, one, pixel, when, a, row, line, is, selected, all, of, the, column, lines, are, connected, to, a, row, of, pixels, and, voltages, corresponding, to, the, picture, information, are, driven, onto, all, of, the, column, lines, the, row, line, is, then, deactivated, and, the, next, row, line, is, selected, all, of, the, row, lines, are, selected, in, sequence, during, a, refresh, operation, active, matrix, addressed, displays, look, brighter, and, sharper, than, passive, matrix, addressed, displays, of, the, same, size, and, generally, have, quicker, response, times, producing, much, better, images, sharp, produces, bistable, reflective, lcds, with, a, 1, bit, sram, cell, per, pixel, that, only, requires, small, amounts, of, power, to, maintain, an, image, segment, lcds, can, also, have, color, by, using, field, sequential, color, fsc, lcd, this, kind, of, displays, have, a, high, speed, passive, segment, lcd, panel, with, an, rgb, backlight, the, backlight, quickly, changes, color, making, it, appear, white, to, the, naked, eye, the, lcd, panel, is, synchronized, with, the, backlight, for, example, to, make, a, segment, appear, red, the, segment, is, only, turned, on, when, the, backlight, is, red, and, to, make, a, segment, appear, magenta, the, segment, is, turned, on, when, the, backlight, is, blue, and, it, continues, to, be, on, while, the, backlight, becomes, red, and, it, turns, off, when, the, backlight, becomes, green, to, make, a, segment, appear, black, the, segment, is, always, turned, on, an, fsc, lcd, divides, a, color, image, into, 3, images, one, red, one, green, and, one, blue, and, it, displays, them, in, order, due, to, persistence, of, vision, the, 3, monochromatic, images, appear, as, one, color, image, an, fsc, lcd, needs, an, lcd, panel, with, a, refresh, rate, of, 180, hz, and, the, response, time, is, reduced, to, just, 5, milliseconds, when, compared, with, normal, stn, lcd, panels, which, have, a, response, time, of, 16, milliseconds, fsc, lcds, contain, a, chip, on, glass, driver, ic, can, also, be, used, with, a, capacitive, touchscreen, samsung, introduced, ufb, ultra, fine, bright, displays, back, in, 2002, utilized, the, super, birefringent, effect, it, has, the, luminance, color, gamut, and, most, of, the, contrast, of, a, tft, lcd, but, only, consumes, as, much, power, as, an, stn, display, according, to, samsung, it, was, being, used, in, a, variety, of, samsung, cellular, telephone, models, produced, until, late, 2006, when, samsung, stopped, producing, ufb, displays, ufb, displays, were, also, used, in, certain, models, of, lg, mobile, phones, twisted, nematic, displays, contain, liquid, crystals, that, twist, and, untwist, at, varying, degrees, to, allow, light, to, pass, through, when, no, voltage, is, applied, to, a, tn, liquid, crystal, cell, polarized, light, passes, through, the, 90, degrees, twisted, lc, layer, in, proportion, to, the, voltage, applied, the, liquid, crystals, untwist, changing, the, polarization, and, blocking, the, light, s, path, by, properly, adjusting, the, level, of, the, voltage, almost, any, gray, level, or, transmission, can, be, achieved, in, plane, switching, is, an, lcd, technology, that, aligns, the, liquid, crystals, in, a, plane, parallel, to, the, glass, substrates, in, this, method, the, electrical, field, is, applied, through, opposite, electrodes, on, the, same, glass, substrate, so, that, the, liquid, crystals, can, be, reoriented, switched, essentially, in, the, same, plane, although, fringe, fields, inhibit, a, homogeneous, reorientation, this, requires, two, transistors, for, each, pixel, instead, of, the, single, transistor, needed, for, a, standard, thin, film, transistor, tft, display, the, ips, technology, is, used, in, everything, from, televisions, computer, monitors, and, even, wearable, devices, especially, almost, all, lcd, smartphone, panels, are, ips, ffs, mode, ips, displays, belong, to, the, lcd, panel, family, screen, types, the, other, two, types, are, va, and, tn, before, lg, enhanced, ips, was, introduced, in, 2001, by, hitachi, as, 17, monitor, in, market, the, additional, transistors, resulted, in, blocking, more, transmission, area, thus, requiring, a, brighter, backlight, and, consuming, more, power, making, this, type, of, display, less, desirable, for, notebook, computers, panasonic, himeji, g8, 5, was, using, an, enhanced, version, of, ips, also, lgd, in, korea, then, currently, the, world, biggest, lcd, panel, manufacture, boe, in, china, is, also, ips, ffs, mode, tv, panel, super, ips, was, later, introduced, after, in, plane, switching, with, even, better, response, times, and, color, reproduction, in, 2015, lg, display, announced, the, implementation, of, a, new, technology, called, m, which, is, the, addition, of, white, subpixel, along, with, the, regular, rgb, dots, in, their, ips, panel, technology, most, of, the, new, m, technology, was, employed, on, 4k, tv, sets, which, led, to, a, controversy, after, tests, showed, that, the, addition, of, a, white, sub, pixel, replacing, the, traditional, rgb, structure, had, also, been, accompanied, by, a, reduction, in, resolution, by, around, 25, this, meant, that, a, 4k, m, tv, would, not, display, the, full, uhd, tv, standard, the, media, and, internet, users, called, them, rgbw, tvs, because, of, the, white, sub, pixel, although, lg, display, has, developed, this, technology, for, use, in, notebook, display, outdoor, and, smartphones, it, became, more, popular, in, the, tv, market, because, of, the, announced, 4k, uhd, resolution, but, still, being, incapable, of, achieving, true, uhd, resolution, defined, by, the, cta, as, 3840x2160, active, pixels, with, 8, bit, color, this, negatively, impacted, the, rendering, of, text, making, it, a, bit, fuzzier, which, was, especially, noticeable, when, a, tv, is, used, as, a, pc, monitor, in, 2011, lg, claimed, the, smartphone, lg, optimus, black, ips, lcd, lcd, nova, has, the, brightness, up, to, 700, nits, while, the, competitor, has, only, ips, lcd, with, 518, nits, and, double, an, active, matrix, oled, amoled, display, with, 305, nits, lg, also, claimed, the, nova, display, to, be, 50, percent, more, efficient, than, regular, lcds, and, to, consume, only, 50, percent, of, the, power, of, amoled, displays, when, producing, white, on, screen, when, it, comes, to, contrast, ratio, amoled, display, still, performs, best, due, to, its, underlying, technology, where, the, black, levels, are, displayed, as, pitch, black, and, not, as, dark, gray, on, august, 24, 2011, nokia, announced, the, nokia, 701, and, also, made, the, claim, of, the, world, s, brightest, display, at, 1000, nits, the, screen, also, had, nokia, s, clearblack, layer, improving, the, contrast, ratio, and, bringing, it, closer, to, that, of, the, amoled, screens, known, as, fringe, field, switching, ffs, until, 2003, advanced, fringe, field, switching, is, similar, to, ips, or, s, ips, offering, superior, performance, and, color, gamut, with, high, luminosity, affs, was, developed, by, hydis, technologies, co, ltd, korea, formally, hyundai, electronics, lcd, task, force, affs, applied, notebook, applications, minimize, color, distortion, while, maintaining, a, wider, viewing, angle, for, a, professional, display, color, shift, and, deviation, caused, by, light, leakage, is, corrected, by, optimizing, the, white, gamut, which, also, enhances, white, gray, reproduction, in, 2004, hydis, technologies, co, ltd, licensed, affs, to, japan, s, hitachi, displays, hitachi, is, using, affs, to, manufacture, high, end, panels, in, 2006, hydis, licensed, affs, to, sanyo, epson, imaging, devices, corporation, shortly, thereafter, hydis, introduced, a, high, transmittance, evolution, of, the, affs, display, called, hffs, ffs, hydis, introduced, affs, with, improved, outdoor, readability, in, 2007, affs, panels, are, mostly, utilized, in, the, cockpits, of, latest, commercial, aircraft, displays, however, it, is, no, longer, produced, as, of, february, 2015, vertical, alignment, displays, are, a, form, of, lcds, in, which, the, liquid, crystals, naturally, align, vertically, to, the, glass, substrates, when, no, voltage, is, applied, the, liquid, crystals, remain, perpendicular, to, the, substrate, creating, a, black, display, between, crossed, polarizers, when, voltage, is, applied, the, liquid, crystals, shift, to, a, tilted, position, allowing, light, to, pass, through, and, create, a, gray, scale, display, depending, on, the, amount, of, tilt, generated, by, the, electric, field, it, has, a, deeper, black, background, a, higher, contrast, ratio, a, wider, viewing, angle, and, better, image, quality, at, extreme, temperatures, than, traditional, twisted, nematic, displays, compared, to, ips, the, black, levels, are, still, deeper, allowing, for, a, higher, contrast, ratio, but, the, viewing, angle, is, narrower, with, color, and, especially, contrast, shift, being, more, apparent, and, the, cost, of, va, is, lower, than, ips, but, higher, than, tn, blue, phase, mode, lcds, have, been, shown, as, engineering, samples, early, in, 2008, but, they, are, not, in, mass, production, the, physics, of, blue, phase, mode, lcds, suggest, that, very, short, switching, times, 1, ms, can, be, achieved, so, time, sequential, color, control, can, possibly, be, realized, and, expensive, color, filters, would, be, obsolete, some, lcd, panels, have, defective, transistors, causing, permanently, lit, or, unlit, pixels, which, are, commonly, referred, to, as, stuck, pixels, or, dead, pixels, respectively, unlike, integrated, circuits, ics, lcd, panels, with, a, few, defective, transistors, are, usually, still, usable, manufacturers, policies, for, the, acceptable, number, of, defective, pixels, vary, greatly, at, one, point, samsung, held, a, zero, tolerance, policy, for, lcd, monitors, sold, in, korea, as, of, 2005, samsung, adheres, to, the, less, restrictive, iso, 13406, 2, standard, other, companies, have, been, known, to, tolerate, as, many, as, 11, dead, pixels, in, their, policies, dead, pixel, policies, are, often, hotly, debated, between, manufacturers, and, customers, to, regulate, the, acceptability, of, defects, and, to, protect, the, end, user, iso, released, the, iso, 13406, 2, standard, which, was, made, obsolete, in, 2008, with, the, release, of, iso, 9241, specifically, iso, 9241, 302, 303, 305, 307, 2008, pixel, defects, however, not, every, lcd, manufacturer, conforms, to, the, iso, standard, and, the, iso, standard, is, quite, often, interpreted, in, different, ways, lcd, panels, are, more, likely, to, have, defects, than, most, ics, due, to, their, larger, size, some, manufacturers, notably, in, south, korea, where, some, of, the, largest, lcd, panel, manufacturers, such, as, lg, are, located, now, have, a, zero, defective, pixel, guarantee, which, is, an, extra, screening, process, which, can, then, determine, a, and, b, grade, panels, many, manufacturers, would, replace, a, product, even, with, one, defective, pixel, even, where, such, guarantees, do, not, exist, the, location, of, defective, pixels, is, important, a, display, with, only, a, few, defective, pixels, may, be, unacceptable, if, the, defective, pixels, are, near, each, other, lcd, panels, also, commonly, have, a, defect, known, as, clouding, dirty, screen, effect, or, less, commonly, mura, which, involves, uneven, patches, of, luminance, on, the, panel, it, is, most, visible, in, dark, or, black, areas, of, displayed, scenes, as, of, 2010, most, premium, branded, computer, lcd, panel, manufacturers, specify, their, products, as, having, zero, defects, the, zenithal, bistable, device, zbd, developed, by, qinetiq, formerly, dera, can, retain, an, image, without, power, the, crystals, may, exist, in, one, of, two, stable, orientations, black, and, white, and, power, is, only, required, to, change, the, image, zbd, displays, is, a, spin, off, company, from, qinetiq, who, manufactured, both, grayscale, and, color, zbd, devices, kent, displays, has, also, developed, a, no, power, display, that, uses, polymer, stabilized, cholesteric, liquid, crystal, chlcd, in, 2009, kent, demonstrated, the, use, of, a, chlcd, to, cover, the, entire, surface, of, a, mobile, phone, allowing, it, to, change, colors, and, keep, that, color, even, when, power, is, removed, in, 2004, researchers, at, the, university, of, oxford, demonstrated, two, new, types, of, zero, power, bistable, lcds, based, on, zenithal, bistable, techniques, several, bistable, technologies, like, the, 360, btn, and, the, bistable, cholesteric, depend, mainly, on, the, bulk, properties, of, the, liquid, crystal, lc, and, use, standard, strong, anchoring, with, alignment, films, and, lc, mixtures, similar, to, the, traditional, monostable, materials, other, bistable, technologies, e, g, binem, technology, are, based, mainly, on, the, surface, properties, and, need, specific, weak, anchoring, materials, some, of, these, issues, relate, to, full, screen, displays, others, to, small, displays, as, on, watches, etc, many, of, the, comparisons, are, with, crt, displays, several, different, families, of, liquid, crystals, are, used, in, liquid, crystal, displays, the, molecules, used, have, to, be, anisotropic, and, to, exhibit, mutual, attraction, polarizable, rod, shaped, molecules, biphenyls, terphenyls, etc, are, common, a, common, form, is, a, pair, of, aromatic, benzene, rings, with, a, nonpolar, moiety, pentyl, heptyl, octyl, or, alkyl, oxy, group, on, one, end, and, polar, nitrile, halogen, on, the, other, sometimes, the, benzene, rings, are, separated, with, an, acetylene, group, ethylene, ch, n, ch, no, n, n, n, no, or, ester, group, in, practice, eutectic, mixtures, of, several, chemicals, are, used, to, achieve, wider, temperature, operating, range, 10, 60, c, for, low, end, and, 20, 100, c, for, high, performance, displays, for, example, the, e7, mixture, is, composed, of, three, biphenyls, and, one, terphenyl, 39, wt, of, 4, pentyl, 4, carbonitrile, nematic, range, 24, 35, c, 36, wt, of, 4, heptyl, 4, carbonitrile, nematic, range, 30, 43, c, 16, wt, of, 4, octoxy, 4, carbonitrile, nematic, range, 54, 80, c, and, 9, wt, of, 4, pentyl, 4, carbonitrile, nematic, range, 131, 240, c, the, production, of, lcd, screens, uses, nitrogen, trifluoride, nf, 3, as, an, etching, fluid, during, the, production, of, the, thin, film, components, nf, 3, is, a, potent, greenhouse, gas, and, its, relatively, long, half, life, may, make, it, a, potentially, harmful, contributor, to, global, warming, a, report, in, geophysical, research, letters, suggested, that, its, effects, were, theoretically, much, greater, than, better, known, sources, of, greenhouse, gasses, like, carbon, dioxide, as, nf, 3, was, not, in, widespread, use, at, the, time, it, was, not, made, part, of, the, kyoto, protocol, and, was, deemed, the, missing, greenhouse, gas, nf, 3, was, added, to, the, kyoto, protocol, for, the, second, compliance, period, during, the, doha, round, critics, of, the, report, point, out, that, it, assumes, that, all, of, the, nf, 3, produced, would, be, released, to, the, atmosphere, in, reality, the, vast, majority, of, nf, 3, is, broken, down, during, the, cleaning, processes, two, earlier, studies, found, that, only, 2, to, 3, of, the, gas, escapes, destruction, after, its, use, furthermore, the, report, failed, to, compare, nf, 3, s, effects, with, what, it, replaced, perfluorocarbon, another, powerful, greenhouse, gas, of, which, anywhere, from, 30, to, 70, escapes, to, the, atmosphere, in, typical, use
