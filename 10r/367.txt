a, nut, is, a, type, of, fastener, with, a, threaded, hole, nuts, are, almost, always, used, in, conjunction, with, a, mating, bolt, to, fasten, multiple, parts, together, the, two, partners, are, kept, together, by, a, combination, of, their, threads, friction, with, slight, elastic, deformation, a, slight, stretching, of, the, bolt, and, compression, of, the, parts, to, be, held, together, in, applications, where, vibration, or, rotation, may, work, a, nut, loose, various, locking, mechanisms, may, be, employed, lock, washers, jam, nuts, eccentric, double, nuts, specialist, adhesive, thread, locking, fluid, such, as, loctite, safety, pins, split, pins, or, lockwire, in, conjunction, with, castellated, nuts, nylon, inserts, nyloc, nut, or, slightly, oval, shaped, threads, square, nuts, as, well, as, bolt, heads, were, the, first, shape, made, and, used, to, be, the, most, common, largely, because, they, were, much, easier, to, manufacture, especially, by, hand, while, rare, today, due, to, the, reasons, stated, below, for, the, preference, of, hexagonal, nuts, they, are, occasionally, used, in, some, situations, when, a, maximum, amount, of, torque, and, grip, is, needed, for, a, given, size, the, greater, length, of, each, side, allows, a, spanner, to, be, applied, with, a, larger, surface, area, and, more, leverage, at, the, nut, the, most, common, shape, today, is, hexagonal, for, similar, reasons, as, the, bolt, head, six, sides, give, a, good, granularity, of, angles, for, a, tool, to, approach, from, good, in, tight, spots, but, more, and, smaller, corners, would, be, vulnerable, to, being, rounded, off, it, takes, only, one, sixth, of, a, rotation, to, obtain, the, next, side, of, the, hexagon, and, grip, is, optimal, however, polygons, with, more, than, six, sides, do, not, give, the, requisite, grip, and, polygons, with, fewer, than, six, sides, take, more, time, to, be, given, a, complete, rotation, other, specialized, shapes, exist, for, certain, needs, such, as, wingnuts, for, finger, adjustment, and, captive, nuts, e, g, cage, nuts, for, inaccessible, areas, a, wide, variety, of, nuts, exists, from, household, hardware, versions, to, specialized, industry, specific, designs, that, are, engineered, to, meet, various, technical, standards, fasteners, used, in, automotive, engineering, and, industrial, applications, usually, need, to, be, tightened, to, a, specific, torque, setting, using, a, torque, wrench, nuts, are, graded, with, strength, ratings, compatible, with, their, respective, bolts, for, example, an, iso, property, class, 10, nut, will, be, able, to, support, the, bolt, proof, strength, load, of, an, iso, property, class, 10, 9, bolt, without, stripping, likewise, an, sae, class, 5, nut, can, support, the, proof, load, of, an, sae, class, 5, bolt, and, so, on, many, specialised, types, of, nut, exist, to, resist, loosening, of, bolted, joints, either, by, providing, a, prevailing, torque, against, the, male, fastener, or, by, gripping, against, the, bolted, components, these, are, generally, referred, to, as, locknuts, note, that, flat, spanner, or, wrench, sizes, differ, between, industry, standards, for, example, spanner, or, wrench, sizes, of, fastener, used, in, japanese, built, cars, comply, with, jis, automotive, standard, hex, nuts, recognized, by, their, six, sided, shape, and, square, nuts, with, a, square, form, are, commonly, used, steel, nuts, are, strong, and, great, for, construction, while, stainless, steel, ones, resist, rust, perfect, for, outdoor, use, brass, nuts, corrosion, resistant, find, their, place, in, electrical, and, plumbing, work, lock, nuts, like, nylon, insert, or, prevailing, torque, types, prevent, loosening, due, to, vibration, or, torque, catering, to, specific, needs, across, industries, the, manufacturing, process, of, nuts, involves, several, steps, it, begins, with, the, selection, of, raw, materials, like, steel, stainless, steel, or, brass, depending, on, the, desired, type, of, nut, the, chosen, material, undergoes, heating, to, make, it, more, malleable, followed, by, forming, or, forging, processes, to, create, the, basic, shape, of, the, nut, threads, are, then, cut, or, formed, onto, the, nut, using, specialized, machinery, after, threading, nuts, may, undergo, additional, treatments, such, as, heat, treatment, or, surface, finishing, to, enhance, their, strength, durability, or, appearance, quality, control, checks, are, performed, throughout, the, manufacturing, process, to, ensure, that, the, nuts, meet, industry, standards, and, specifications
