a, tank, is, an, armoured, fighting, vehicle, intended, as, a, primary, offensive, weapon, in, front, line, ground, combat, tank, designs, are, a, balance, of, heavy, firepower, strong, armour, and, battlefield, mobility, provided, by, tracks, and, a, powerful, engine, their, main, armament, is, often, mounted, within, a, turret, they, are, a, mainstay, of, modern, 20th, and, 21st, century, ground, forces, and, a, key, part, of, combined, arms, combat, modern, tanks, are, versatile, mobile, land, weapons, platforms, whose, main, armament, is, a, large, caliber, tank, gun, mounted, in, a, rotating, gun, turret, supplemented, by, machine, guns, or, other, ranged, weapons, such, as, anti, tank, guided, missiles, or, rocket, launchers, they, have, heavy, vehicle, armour, which, provides, protection, for, the, crew, the, vehicle, s, munition, storage, fuel, tank, and, propulsion, systems, the, use, of, tracks, rather, than, wheels, provides, improved, operational, mobility, which, allows, the, tank, to, overcome, rugged, terrain, and, adverse, conditions, such, as, mud, and, ice, snow, better, than, wheeled, vehicles, and, thus, be, more, flexibly, positioned, at, advantageous, locations, on, the, battlefield, these, features, enable, the, tank, to, perform, in, a, variety, of, intense, combat, situations, simultaneously, both, offensively, with, direct, fire, from, their, powerful, main, gun, and, defensively, as, fire, support, and, defilade, for, friendly, troops, due, to, the, near, invulnerability, to, common, infantry, small, arms, and, good, resistance, against, heavier, weapons, although, anti, tank, weapons, used, in, 2022, some, of, them, man, portable, have, demonstrated, the, ability, to, destroy, older, generations, of, tanks, with, single, shots, all, while, maintaining, the, mobility, needed, to, exploit, changing, tactical, situations, fully, integrating, tanks, into, modern, military, forces, spawned, a, new, era, of, combat, armoured, warfare, until, the, invention, of, the, main, battle, tank, tanks, were, typically, categorized, either, by, weight, class, light, medium, heavy, or, superheavy, tanks, or, doctrinal, purpose, breakthrough, cavalry, infantry, cruiser, or, reconnaissance, tanks, some, are, larger, and, more, thickly, armoured, and, with, large, guns, while, others, are, smaller, lightly, armoured, and, equipped, with, a, smaller, caliber, and, lighter, gun, these, smaller, tanks, move, over, terrain, with, speed, and, agility, and, can, perform, a, reconnaissance, role, in, addition, to, engaging, hostile, targets, the, smaller, faster, tank, would, not, normally, engage, in, battle, with, a, larger, heavily, armoured, tank, except, during, a, surprise, flanking, manoeuvre, the, word, tank, was, first, applied, in, a, military, context, to, british, landships, in, 1915, to, keep, their, nature, secret, before, they, entered, service, on, 24, december, 1915, a, meeting, took, place, of, the, inter, departmental, conference, including, representatives, of, the, director, of, naval, construction, s, committee, the, admiralty, the, ministry, of, munitions, and, the, war, office, its, purpose, was, to, discuss, the, progress, of, the, plans, for, what, were, described, as, caterpillar, machine, gun, destroyers, or, land, cruisers, in, his, autobiography, albert, gerald, stern, secretary, to, the, landship, committee, later, head, of, the, mechanical, warfare, supply, department, says, that, at, that, meeting, mr, thomas, j, macnamara, m, p, and, parliamentary, and, financial, secretary, to, the, admiralty, then, suggested, for, secrecy, s, sake, to, change, the, title, of, the, landship, committee, mr, d, eyncourt, agreed, that, it, was, very, desirable, to, retain, secrecy, by, all, means, and, proposed, to, refer, to, the, vessel, as, a, water, carrier, in, government, offices, committees, and, departments, are, always, known, by, their, initials, for, this, reason, i, as, secretary, considered, the, proposed, title, totally, unsuitable, in, our, search, for, a, synonymous, term, we, changed, the, word, water, carrier, to, tank, and, became, the, tank, supply, or, t, s, committee, that, is, how, these, weapons, came, to, be, called, tanks, he, incorrectly, added, and, the, name, has, now, been, adopted, by, all, countries, in, the, world, lieutenant, colonel, ernest, swinton, who, was, secretary, to, the, meeting, says, that, he, was, instructed, to, find, a, non, committal, word, when, writing, his, report, of, the, proceedings, in, the, evening, he, discussed, it, with, a, fellow, officer, lt, col, walter, dally, jones, and, they, chose, the, word, tank, that, night, in, the, draft, report, of, the, conference, the, word, tank, was, employed, in, its, new, sense, for, the, first, time, swinton, s, notes, on, the, employment, of, tanks, in, which, he, uses, the, word, throughout, was, published, in, january, 1916, in, july, 1918, popular, science, monthly, reported, because, a, fellow, of, the, royal, historical, society, has, unintentionally, misled, the, british, public, as, to, the, origin, of, the, famous, tanks, sir, william, tritton, who, designed, and, built, them, has, published, the, real, story, of, their, name, since, it, was, obviously, inadvisable, to, herald, little, willie, s, reason, for, existence, to, the, world, he, was, known, as, the, instructional, demonstration, unit, little, willie, s, hull, was, called, in, the, shop, orders, a, water, carrier, for, mesopotamia, no, one, knew, that, the, hull, was, intended, to, be, mounted, on, a, truck, naturally, the, water, carrier, began, to, be, called, a, tank, so, the, name, came, to, be, used, by, managers, and, foremen, of, the, shop, until, now, it, has, a, place, in, the, army, vocabulary, and, will, probably, be, so, known, in, history, for, all, time, f, j, gardiner, f, r, hist, s, d, eyncourt, s, account, differs, from, swinton, s, and, tritton, s, when, the, future, arrangements, were, under, discussion, for, transporting, the, first, landships, to, france, a, question, arose, as, to, how, from, a, security, point, of, view, the, consignment, should, be, labelled, to, justify, their, size, we, decided, to, call, them, water, carriers, for, russia, the, idea, being, that, they, should, be, taken, for, some, new, method, of, taking, water, to, forward, troops, in, the, battle, areas, lt, col, swinton, raised, a, humorous, objection, to, this, remarking, that, the, war, office, pundits, would, probably, contract, the, description, to, w, c, s, for, russia, and, that, we, had, better, forestall, this, by, merely, labelling, the, packages, tanks, so, tanks, they, became, and, tanks, they, have, remained, this, appears, to, be, an, imperfect, recollection, he, says, that, the, name, problem, arose, when, we, shipped, the, first, two, vehicles, to, france, the, following, year, august, 1916, but, by, that, time, the, name, tank, had, been, in, use, for, eight, months, the, tanks, were, labelled, with, care, to, petrograd, but, the, belief, was, encouraged, that, they, were, a, type, of, snowplough, the, term, tank, is, used, throughout, the, english, speaking, world, but, other, countries, use, different, terminology, in, france, the, second, country, to, use, tanks, in, battle, the, word, tank, or, tanque, was, adopted, initially, but, was, then, largely, at, the, insistence, of, colonel, j, b, e, estienne, rejected, in, favour, of, char, d, assaut, assault, vehicle, or, simply, char, vehicle, during, world, war, i, german, sources, tended, to, refer, to, british, tanks, as, tanks, and, to, their, own, as, kampfwagen, later, tanks, became, referred, to, as, panzer, lit, armour, a, shortened, form, of, the, full, term, panzerkampfwagen, literally, armoured, fighting, vehicle, in, the, arab, world, tanks, are, called, dabb, ba, after, a, type, of, siege, engine, in, italian, a, tank, is, a, carro, armato, lit, armed, wagon, without, reference, to, its, armour, norway, uses, the, term, stridsvogn, and, sweden, the, similar, stridsvagn, lit, battle, wagon, also, used, for, chariots, whereas, denmark, uses, kampvogn, lit, fight, wagon, finland, uses, panssarivaunu, armoured, wagon, although, tankki, is, also, used, colloquially, the, polish, name, czo, g, derived, from, verb, czo, ga, si, to, crawl, is, used, depicting, the, way, of, machine, s, movement, and, its, speed, in, hungarian, the, tank, is, called, harckocsi, combat, wagon, albeit, tank, is, also, common, in, japanese, the, term, sensha, lit, battle, vehicle, is, taken, from, chinese, and, used, and, this, term, is, likewise, borrowed, into, korean, as, jeoncha, more, recent, chinese, literature, uses, the, english, derived, t, nk, tank, as, opposed, to, zh, nch, battle, vehicle, used, in, earlier, days, the, modern, tank, is, the, result, of, a, century, of, development, from, the, first, primitive, armoured, vehicles, due, to, improvements, in, technology, such, as, the, internal, combustion, engine, which, allowed, the, rapid, movement, of, heavy, armoured, vehicles, as, a, result, of, these, advances, tanks, underwent, tremendous, shifts, in, capability, in, the, years, since, their, first, appearance, tanks, in, world, war, i, were, developed, separately, and, simultaneously, by, great, britain, and, france, as, a, means, to, break, the, deadlock, of, trench, warfare, on, the, western, front, the, first, british, prototype, nicknamed, little, willie, was, constructed, at, william, foster, co, in, lincoln, england, in, 1915, with, leading, roles, played, by, major, walter, gordon, wilson, who, designed, the, gearbox, and, hull, and, by, william, tritton, of, william, foster, and, co, who, designed, the, track, plates, this, was, a, prototype, of, a, new, design, that, would, become, the, british, army, s, mark, i, tank, the, first, tank, used, in, combat, in, september, 1916, during, the, battle, of, the, somme, the, name, tank, was, adopted, by, the, british, during, the, early, stages, of, their, development, as, a, security, measure, to, conceal, their, purpose, see, etymology, while, the, british, and, french, built, thousands, of, tanks, in, world, war, i, germany, was, unconvinced, of, the, tank, s, potential, and, did, not, have, enough, resources, thus, it, built, only, twenty, tanks, of, the, interwar, period, evolved, into, the, much, larger, and, more, powerful, designs, of, world, war, ii, important, new, concepts, of, armoured, warfare, were, developed, the, soviet, union, launched, the, first, mass, tank, air, attack, at, khalkhin, gol, nomonhan, in, august, 1939, and, later, developed, the, t, 34, one, of, the, predecessors, of, the, main, battle, tank, less, than, two, weeks, later, germany, began, their, large, scale, armoured, campaigns, that, would, become, known, as, blitzkrieg, lightning, war, massed, concentrations, of, tanks, combined, with, motorized, and, mechanized, infantry, artillery, and, air, power, designed, to, break, through, the, enemy, front, and, collapse, enemy, resistance, the, widespread, introduction, of, high, explosive, anti, tank, warheads, during, the, second, half, of, world, war, ii, led, to, lightweight, infantry, carried, anti, tank, weapons, such, as, the, panzerfaust, which, could, destroy, some, types, of, tanks, tanks, in, the, cold, war, were, designed, with, these, weapons, in, mind, and, led, to, greatly, improved, armour, types, during, the, 1960s, especially, composite, armour, improved, engines, transmissions, and, suspensions, allowed, tanks, of, this, period, to, grow, larger, aspects, of, gun, technology, changed, significantly, as, well, with, advances, in, shell, design, and, aiming, technology, during, the, cold, war, the, main, battle, tank, concept, arose, and, became, a, key, component, of, modern, armies, in, the, 21st, century, with, the, increasing, role, of, asymmetrical, warfare, and, the, end, of, the, cold, war, that, also, contributed, to, the, increase, of, cost, effective, anti, tank, rocket, propelled, grenades, rpgs, worldwide, and, its, successors, the, ability, of, tanks, to, operate, independently, has, declined, modern, tanks, are, more, frequently, organized, into, combined, arms, units, which, involve, the, support, of, infantry, who, may, accompany, the, tanks, in, infantry, fighting, vehicles, and, supported, by, reconnaissance, or, ground, attack, aircraft, the, tank, is, the, 20th, century, realization, of, an, ancient, concept, that, of, providing, troops, with, mobile, protection, and, firepower, the, internal, combustion, engine, armour, plate, and, continuous, track, were, key, innovations, leading, to, the, invention, of, the, modern, tank, during, the, 119, bc, battle, of, mobei, of, the, han, xiongnu, war, the, famous, han, general, wei, qing, led, his, army, through, a, fatiguing, expeditionary, march, across, the, gobi, desert, only, to, find, yizhixie, chanyu, s, main, force, waiting, to, encircle, them, on, the, other, side, using, armored, heavy, wagons, known, as, wu, gang, wagon, chinese, in, ring, formations, that, provided, chinese, archers, crossbowmen, and, infantry, protection, from, the, xiongnu, s, powerful, cavalry, charges, and, allowed, han, troops, to, utilize, their, ranged, weapons, advantages, of, precision, this, forced, a, stalemate, and, allowed, time, for, his, troops, to, recover, strength, before, using, the, cover, of, a, sandstorm, to, launch, a, counteroffensive, which, overran, the, nomads, many, sources, imply, that, leonardo, da, vinci, and, h, g, wells, in, some, way, foresaw, or, invented, the, tank, leonardo, s, late, 15th, century, drawings, of, what, some, describe, as, a, tank, show, a, man, powered, wheeled, vehicle, with, cannons, all, around, it, however, the, human, crew, would, not, have, enough, power, to, move, it, over, larger, distance, and, usage, of, animals, was, problematic, in, a, space, so, confined, in, the, 15th, century, jan, i, ka, built, armoured, wagons, known, as, wagenburg, containing, cannons, and, used, them, effectively, in, several, battles, during, the, hussite, wars, the, continuous, caterpillar, track, arose, from, attempts, to, improve, the, mobility, of, wheeled, vehicles, by, spreading, their, weight, reducing, ground, pressure, and, increasing, their, traction, experiments, can, be, traced, back, as, far, as, the, 17th, century, and, by, the, late, nineteenth, they, existed, in, various, recognizable, and, practical, forms, in, several, countries, it, is, frequently, claimed, that, richard, lovell, edgeworth, created, a, caterpillar, track, it, is, true, that, in, 1770, he, patented, a, machine, that, should, carry, and, lay, down, its, own, road, but, this, was, edgeworth, s, choice, of, words, his, own, account, in, his, autobiography, is, of, a, horse, drawn, wooden, carriage, on, eight, retractable, legs, capable, of, lifting, itself, over, high, walls, the, description, bears, no, similarity, to, a, caterpillar, track, armoured, trains, appeared, in, the, mid, 19th, century, and, various, armoured, steam, and, petrol, engined, vehicles, were, also, proposed, the, machines, described, in, wells, s, 1903, short, story, the, land, ironclads, are, a, step, closer, insofar, as, they, are, armour, plated, have, an, internal, power, plant, and, are, able, to, cross, trenches, some, aspects, of, the, story, foresee, the, tactical, use, and, impact, of, the, tanks, that, later, came, into, being, however, wells, s, vehicles, were, driven, by, steam, and, moved, on, pedrail, wheels, technologies, that, were, already, outdated, at, the, time, of, writing, after, seeing, british, tanks, in, 1916, wells, denied, having, invented, them, writing, yet, let, me, state, at, once, that, i, was, not, their, prime, originator, i, took, up, an, idea, manipulated, it, slightly, and, handed, it, on, it, is, though, possible, that, one, of, the, british, tank, pioneers, ernest, swinton, was, subconsciously, or, otherwise, influenced, by, wells, s, tale, the, first, combinations, of, the, three, principal, components, of, the, tank, appeared, in, the, decade, before, world, war, one, in, 1903, captain, l, on, ren, levavasseur, of, the, french, artillery, proposed, mounting, a, field, gun, in, an, armoured, box, on, tracks, major, william, e, donohue, of, the, british, army, s, mechanical, transport, committee, suggested, fixing, a, gun, and, armoured, shield, on, a, british, type, of, track, driven, vehicle, the, first, armoured, car, was, produced, in, austria, in, 1904, however, all, were, restricted, to, rails, or, reasonably, passable, terrain, it, was, the, development, of, a, practical, caterpillar, track, that, provided, the, necessary, independent, all, terrain, mobility, in, a, memorandum, of, 1908, antarctic, explorer, robert, falcon, scott, presented, his, view, that, man, hauling, to, the, south, pole, was, impossible, and, that, motor, traction, was, needed, snow, vehicles, did, not, yet, exist, however, and, so, his, engineer, reginald, skelton, developed, the, idea, of, a, caterpillar, track, for, snow, surfaces, these, tracked, motors, were, built, by, the, wolseley, tool, and, motor, car, company, in, birmingham, and, tested, in, switzerland, and, norway, and, can, be, seen, in, action, in, herbert, ponting, s, 1911, documentary, film, of, scott, s, antarctic, terra, nova, expedition, scott, died, during, the, expedition, in, 1912, but, expedition, member, and, biographer, apsley, cherry, garrard, credited, scott, s, motors, with, the, inspiration, for, the, british, world, war, i, tanks, writing, scott, never, knew, their, true, possibilities, for, they, were, the, direct, ancestors, of, the, tanks, in, france, in, 1911, a, lieutenant, engineer, in, the, austrian, army, g, nther, burstyn, presented, to, the, austrian, and, prussian, war, ministries, plans, for, a, light, three, man, tank, with, a, gun, in, a, revolving, turret, the, so, called, burstyn, motorgesch, tz, in, the, same, year, an, australian, civil, engineer, named, lancelot, de, mole, submitted, a, basic, design, for, a, tracked, armoured, vehicle, to, the, british, war, office, in, russia, vasiliy, mendeleev, designed, a, tracked, vehicle, containing, a, large, naval, gun, all, of, these, ideas, were, rejected, and, by, 1914, forgotten, although, it, was, officially, acknowledged, after, the, war, that, de, mole, s, design, was, at, least, the, equal, to, the, initial, british, tanks, various, individuals, continued, to, contemplate, the, use, of, tracked, vehicles, for, military, applications, but, by, the, outbreak, of, the, war, no, one, in, a, position, of, responsibility, in, any, army, seems, to, have, given, much, thought, to, tanks, the, direct, military, impact, of, the, tank, can, be, debated, but, its, effect, on, the, germans, was, immense, it, caused, bewilderment, terror, and, concern, in, equal, measure, it, was, also, a, huge, boost, to, the, civilians, at, home, after, facing, the, zeppelins, at, last, britain, had, a, wonder, weapon, tanks, were, taken, on, tours, and, treated, almost, like, film, stars, from, late, 1914, a, small, number, of, middle, ranking, british, army, officers, tried, to, persuade, the, war, office, and, the, government, to, consider, the, creation, of, armoured, vehicles, amongst, their, suggestions, was, the, use, of, caterpillar, tractors, but, although, the, army, used, many, such, vehicles, for, towing, heavy, guns, it, could, not, be, persuaded, that, they, could, be, adapted, as, armoured, vehicles, the, consequence, was, that, early, tank, development, in, the, united, kingdom, was, carried, out, by, the, royal, navy, as, the, result, of, an, approach, by, royal, naval, air, service, officers, who, had, been, operating, armoured, cars, on, the, western, front, the, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, winston, churchill, formed, the, landship, committee, on, 20, february, 1915, the, director, of, naval, construction, for, the, royal, navy, eustace, tennyson, d, eyncourt, was, appointed, to, head, the, committee, in, view, of, his, experience, with, the, engineering, methods, it, was, felt, might, be, required, the, two, other, members, were, naval, officers, and, a, number, of, industrialists, were, engaged, as, consultants, so, many, played, a, part, in, its, long, and, complicated, development, that, it, is, not, possible, to, name, any, individual, as, the, sole, inventor, of, the, tank, however, leading, roles, were, played, by, lt, walter, gordon, wilson, r, n, who, designed, the, gearbox, and, developed, practical, tracks, and, by, william, tritton, whose, agricultural, machinery, company, william, foster, co, in, lincoln, lincolnshire, england, built, the, prototypes, on, 22, july, 1915, a, commission, was, placed, to, design, a, machine, that, could, cross, a, trench, 4, ft, wide, secrecy, surrounded, the, project, with, the, designers, locking, themselves, in, a, room, at, the, white, hart, hotel, in, lincoln, the, committee, s, first, design, little, willie, ran, for, the, first, time, in, september, 1915, and, served, to, develop, the, form, of, the, track, but, an, improved, design, better, able, to, cross, trenches, swiftly, followed, and, in, january, 1916, the, prototype, nicknamed, mother, was, adopted, as, the, design, for, future, tanks, the, first, order, for, tanks, was, placed, on, 12, february, 1916, and, a, second, on, 21, april, fosters, built, 37, all, male, and, metropolitan, railway, carriage, and, wagon, company, of, birmingham, 113, 38, male, and, 75, female, a, total, of, 150, production, models, of, male, tanks, armed, with, naval, cannon, and, machine, guns, and, females, carrying, only, machine, guns, would, go, on, to, fight, in, history, s, first, tank, action, at, the, somme, in, september, 1916, great, britain, produced, about, 2, 600, tanks, of, various, types, during, the, war, the, first, tank, to, engage, in, battle, was, designated, d1, a, british, mark, i, male, during, the, battle, of, flers, courcelette, part, of, the, wider, somme, offensive, on, 15, september, 1916, bert, chaney, a, nineteen, year, old, signaller, with, the, 7th, london, territorial, battalion, reported, that, three, huge, mechanical, monsters, such, as, had, never, seen, before, rumbled, their, way, onto, the, battlefield, frightening, the, jerries, out, of, their, wits, and, making, them, scuttle, like, frightened, rabbits, when, the, news, of, the, first, use, of, the, tanks, emerged, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, commented, it, is, really, to, mr, winston, churchill, that, the, credit, is, due, more, than, to, anyone, else, he, took, up, with, enthusiasm, the, idea, of, making, them, a, long, time, ago, and, he, met, with, many, difficulties, he, converted, me, and, at, the, ministry, of, munitions, he, went, ahead, and, made, them, the, admiralty, experts, were, invaluable, and, gave, the, greatest, possible, assistance, they, are, of, course, experts, in, the, matter, of, armour, plating, major, stern, formerly, an, officer, in, the, royal, naval, air, service, a, business, man, at, the, ministry, of, munitions, had, charge, of, the, work, of, getting, them, built, and, he, did, the, task, very, well, col, swinton, and, others, also, did, valuable, work, whilst, several, experimental, machines, were, investigated, in, france, it, was, a, colonel, of, artillery, j, b, e, estienne, who, directly, approached, the, commander, in, chief, with, detailed, plans, for, a, tank, on, caterpillar, tracks, in, late, 1915, the, result, was, two, largely, unsatisfactory, types, of, tank, 400, each, of, the, schneider, and, saint, chamond, both, based, on, the, holt, tractor, the, following, year, the, french, pioneered, the, use, of, a, full, 360, rotation, turret, in, a, tank, for, the, first, time, with, the, creation, of, the, renault, ft, light, tank, with, the, turret, containing, the, tank, s, main, armament, in, addition, to, the, traversable, turret, another, innovative, feature, of, the, ft, was, its, engine, located, at, the, rear, this, pattern, with, the, gun, located, in, a, mounted, turret, and, the, engine, at, the, back, has, become, the, standard, for, most, succeeding, tanks, across, the, world, even, to, this, day, the, ft, was, the, most, numerous, tank, of, the, war, over, 3, 000, were, made, by, late, 1918, germany, fielded, very, few, tanks, during, world, war, i, and, started, development, only, after, encountering, british, tanks, on, the, somme, the, a7v, the, only, type, made, was, introduced, in, march, 1918, with, just, 20, being, produced, during, the, war, the, first, tank, versus, tank, action, took, place, on, 24, april, 1918, at, the, second, battle, of, villers, bretonneux, france, when, three, british, mark, ivs, met, three, german, a7vs, captured, british, mk, ivs, formed, the, bulk, of, germany, s, tank, forces, during, world, war, i, about, 35, were, in, service, at, any, one, time, plans, to, expand, the, tank, programme, were, under, way, when, the, war, ended, the, united, states, tank, corps, used, tanks, supplied, by, france, and, great, britain, during, world, war, i, production, of, american, built, tanks, had, just, begun, when, the, war, came, to, an, end, italy, also, manufactured, two, fiat, 2000s, towards, the, end, of, the, war, too, late, to, see, service, russia, independently, built, and, trialed, two, prototypes, early, in, the, war, the, tracked, two, man, vezdekhod, and, the, huge, lebedenko, but, neither, went, into, production, a, tracked, self, propelled, gun, was, also, designed, but, not, produced, although, tank, tactics, developed, rapidly, during, the, war, piecemeal, deployments, mechanical, problems, and, poor, mobility, limited, the, military, significance, of, the, tank, in, world, war, i, and, the, tank, did, not, fulfil, its, promise, of, rendering, trench, warfare, obsolete, nonetheless, it, was, clear, to, military, thinkers, on, both, sides, that, tanks, in, some, way, could, have, a, significant, role, in, future, conflicts, in, the, interwar, period, tanks, underwent, further, mechanical, development, in, terms, of, tactics, j, f, c, fuller, s, doctrine, of, spearhead, attacks, with, massed, tank, formations, was, the, basis, for, work, by, heinz, guderian, in, germany, percy, hobart, in, britain, adna, r, chaffee, jr, in, the, us, charles, de, gaulle, in, france, and, mikhail, tukhachevsky, in, the, ussr, liddell, hart, held, a, more, moderate, view, that, all, arms, cavalry, infantry, and, artillery, should, be, mechanized, and, work, together, the, british, formed, the, all, arms, experimental, mechanized, force, to, test, the, use, of, tanks, with, supporting, forces, in, the, second, world, war, only, germany, would, initially, put, the, theory, into, practice, on, a, large, scale, and, it, was, their, superior, tactics, and, french, blunders, not, superior, weapons, that, made, the, blitzkrieg, so, successful, in, may, 1940, for, information, regarding, tank, development, in, this, period, see, tank, development, between, the, wars, germany, italy, and, the, soviet, union, all, experimented, heavily, with, tank, warfare, during, their, clandestine, and, volunteer, involvement, in, the, spanish, civil, war, which, saw, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, successful, mechanized, combined, arms, such, as, when, republican, troops, equipped, with, soviet, supplied, tanks, and, supported, by, aircraft, eventually, routed, italian, troops, fighting, for, the, nationalists, in, the, seven, day, battle, of, guadalajara, in, 1937, however, of, the, nearly, 700, tanks, deployed, during, this, conflict, only, about, 64, tanks, representing, the, franco, faction, and, 331, from, the, republican, side, were, equipped, with, cannon, and, of, those, 64, nearly, all, were, world, war, i, vintage, renault, ft, tanks, while, the, 331, soviet, supplied, machines, had, 45mm, main, guns, and, were, of, 1930s, manufacture, the, balance, of, nationalist, tanks, were, machine, gun, armed, the, primary, lesson, learned, from, this, war, was, that, machine, gun, armed, tanks, had, to, be, equipped, with, cannon, with, the, associated, armour, inherent, to, modern, tanks, the, five, month, long, war, between, the, soviet, union, and, the, japanese, 6th, army, at, khalkhin, gol, nomonhan, in, 1939, brought, home, some, lessons, in, this, conflict, the, soviets, fielded, over, two, thousand, tanks, to, the, around, 73, cannon, armed, tanks, deployed, by, the, japanese, the, major, difference, being, that, japanese, armour, were, equipped, with, diesel, engines, as, opposed, to, the, russian, tanks, equipped, with, petrol, engines, after, general, georgy, zhukov, inflicted, a, defeat, on, the, japanese, 6th, army, with, his, massed, combined, tank, and, air, attack, the, soviets, learned, a, lesson, on, the, use, of, gasoline, engines, and, quickly, incorporated, those, newly, found, experiences, into, their, new, t, 34, medium, tank, during, world, war, ii, prior, to, world, war, ii, the, tactics, and, strategy, of, deploying, tank, forces, underwent, a, revolution, in, august, 1939, soviet, general, georgy, zhukov, used, the, combined, force, of, tanks, and, airpower, at, nomonhan, against, the, japanese, 6th, army, heinz, guderian, a, tactical, theoretician, who, was, heavily, involved, in, the, formation, of, the, first, independent, german, tank, force, said, where, tanks, are, the, front, is, and, this, concept, became, a, reality, in, world, war, ii, guderian, s, armoured, warfare, ideas, combined, with, germany, s, existing, doctrines, of, bewegungskrieg, maneuver, warfare, and, infiltration, tactics, from, world, war, i, became, the, basis, of, blitzkrieg, in, the, opening, stages, of, world, war, ii, during, world, war, ii, the, first, conflict, in, which, armoured, vehicles, were, critical, to, battlefield, success, the, tank, and, related, tactics, developed, rapidly, armoured, forces, proved, capable, of, tactical, victory, in, an, unprecedentedly, short, amount, of, time, yet, new, anti, tank, weaponry, showed, that, the, tank, was, not, invulnerable, during, the, invasion, of, poland, tanks, performed, in, a, more, traditional, role, in, close, cooperation, with, infantry, units, but, in, the, battle, of, france, deep, independent, armoured, penetrations, were, executed, by, the, germans, a, technique, later, called, blitzkrieg, blitzkrieg, used, innovative, combined, arms, tactics, and, radios, in, all, of, the, tanks, to, provide, a, level, of, tactical, flexibility, and, power, that, surpassed, that, of, the, allied, armour, the, french, army, with, tanks, equal, or, superior, to, the, german, tanks, in, both, quality, and, quantity, employed, a, linear, defensive, strategy, in, which, the, armoured, cavalry, units, were, made, subservient, to, the, needs, of, the, infantry, armies, to, cover, their, entrenchment, in, belgium, in, addition, they, lacked, radios, in, many, of, their, tanks, and, headquarters, which, limited, their, ability, to, respond, to, german, attacks, in, accordance, with, blitzkrieg, methods, german, tanks, bypassed, enemy, strongpoints, and, could, radio, for, close, air, support, to, destroy, them, or, leave, them, to, the, infantry, a, related, development, motorized, infantry, allowed, some, of, the, troops, to, keep, up, with, the, tanks, and, create, highly, mobile, combined, arms, forces, the, defeat, of, a, major, military, power, within, weeks, shocked, the, rest, of, the, world, spurring, tank, and, anti, tank, weapon, development, the, north, african, campaign, also, provided, an, important, battleground, for, tanks, as, the, flat, desolate, terrain, with, relatively, few, obstacles, or, urban, environments, was, ideal, for, conducting, mobile, armoured, warfare, however, this, battlefield, also, showed, the, importance, of, logistics, especially, in, an, armoured, force, as, the, principal, warring, armies, the, german, afrika, korps, and, the, british, eighth, army, often, outpaced, their, supply, trains, in, repeated, attacks, and, counter, attacks, on, each, other, resulting, in, complete, stalemate, this, situation, would, not, be, resolved, until, 1942, when, during, the, second, battle, of, el, alamein, the, afrika, korps, crippled, by, disruptions, in, their, supply, lines, had, 95, of, its, tanks, destroyed, and, was, forced, to, retreat, by, a, massively, reinforced, eighth, army, the, first, in, a, series, of, defeats, that, would, eventually, lead, to, the, surrender, of, the, remaining, axis, forces, in, tunisia, when, germany, launched, its, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, operation, barbarossa, the, soviets, had, a, superior, tank, design, the, t, 34, a, lack, of, preparations, for, the, axis, surprise, attack, mechanical, problems, poor, training, of, the, crews, and, incompetent, leadership, caused, the, soviet, machines, to, be, surrounded, and, destroyed, in, large, numbers, however, interference, from, adolf, hitler, the, geographic, scale, of, the, conflict, the, dogged, resistance, of, the, soviet, combat, troops, and, the, soviets, massive, advantages, in, manpower, and, production, capability, prevented, a, repeat, of, the, german, successes, of, 1940, despite, early, successes, against, the, soviets, the, germans, were, forced, to, up, gun, their, panzer, ivs, and, to, design, and, build, both, the, larger, and, more, expensive, tiger, heavy, tank, in, 1942, and, the, panther, medium, tank, the, following, year, in, doing, so, the, wehrmacht, denied, the, infantry, and, other, support, arms, the, production, priorities, that, they, needed, to, remain, equal, partners, with, the, increasingly, sophisticated, tanks, in, turn, violating, the, principle, of, combined, arms, they, had, pioneered, soviet, developments, following, the, invasion, included, upgunning, the, t, 34, development, of, self, propelled, anti, tank, guns, such, as, the, su, 152, and, deployment, of, the, is, 2, in, the, closing, stages, of, the, war, with, the, t, 34, being, the, most, produced, tank, of, world, war, ii, totalling, up, to, some, 65, 000, examples, by, may, 1945, much, like, the, soviets, when, entering, world, war, ii, six, months, later, december, 1941, the, united, states, mass, production, capacity, enabled, it, to, rapidly, construct, thousands, of, relatively, cheap, m4, sherman, medium, tanks, a, compromise, all, round, the, sherman, was, reliable, and, formed, a, large, part, of, the, anglo, american, ground, forces, but, in, a, tank, versus, tank, battle, was, no, match, for, the, panther, or, tiger, numerical, and, logistical, superiority, and, the, successful, use, of, combined, arms, allowed, the, allies, to, overrun, the, german, forces, during, the, battle, of, normandy, upgunned, versions, with, the, 76, mm, gun, m1, and, the, 17, pounder, were, introduced, to, improve, the, m4, s, firepower, but, concerns, about, protection, remained, despite, the, apparent, armour, deficiencies, a, total, of, some, 42, 000, shermans, were, built, and, delivered, to, the, allied, nations, using, it, during, the, war, years, a, total, second, only, to, the, t, 34, tank, hulls, were, modified, to, produce, flame, tanks, mobile, rocket, artillery, and, combat, engineering, vehicles, for, tasks, including, mine, clearing, and, bridging, specialized, self, propelled, guns, most, of, which, could, double, as, tank, destroyers, were, also, both, developed, by, the, germans, with, their, sturmgesch, tz, panzerj, ger, and, jagdpanzer, vehicles, and, the, samokhodnaya, ustanovka, families, of, afv, s, for, the, soviets, such, turretless, casemate, style, tank, destroyers, and, assault, guns, were, less, complex, stripped, down, tanks, carrying, heavy, guns, solely, firing, forward, the, firepower, and, low, cost, of, these, vehicles, made, them, attractive, but, as, manufacturing, techniques, improved, and, larger, turret, rings, made, larger, tank, guns, feasible, the, gun, turret, was, recognized, as, the, most, effective, mounting, for, the, main, gun, to, allow, movement, in, a, different, direction, from, firing, enhancing, tactical, flexibility, during, the, cold, war, tension, between, the, warsaw, pact, countries, and, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, nato, countries, created, an, arms, race, that, ensured, that, tank, development, proceeded, largely, as, it, had, during, world, war, ii, the, essence, of, tank, designs, during, the, cold, war, had, been, hammered, out, in, the, closing, stages, of, world, war, ii, large, turrets, capable, suspension, systems, greatly, improved, engines, sloped, armour, and, large, caliber, 90, mm, and, larger, guns, were, standard, tank, design, during, the, cold, war, built, on, this, foundation, and, included, improvements, to, fire, control, gyroscopic, gun, stabilization, communications, primarily, radio, and, crew, comfort, and, saw, the, introduction, of, laser, rangefinders, and, infrared, night, vision, equipment, armour, technology, progressed, in, an, ongoing, race, against, improvements, in, anti, tank, weapons, especially, antitank, guided, missiles, like, the, tow, medium, tanks, of, world, war, ii, evolved, into, the, main, battle, tank, mbt, of, the, cold, war, and, took, over, the, majority, of, tank, roles, on, the, battlefield, this, gradual, transition, occurred, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, due, to, anti, tank, guided, missiles, sabot, ammunition, and, high, explosive, anti, tank, warheads, world, war, ii, had, shown, that, the, speed, of, a, light, tank, was, no, substitute, for, armour, firepower, and, medium, tanks, were, vulnerable, to, newer, weapon, technology, rendering, them, obsolete, in, a, trend, started, in, world, war, ii, economies, of, scale, led, to, serial, production, of, progressively, upgraded, models, of, all, major, tanks, during, the, cold, war, for, the, same, reason, many, upgraded, post, world, war, ii, tanks, and, their, derivatives, for, example, the, t, 55, and, t, 72, remain, in, active, service, around, the, world, and, even, an, obsolete, tank, may, be, the, most, formidable, weapon, on, battlefields, in, many, parts, of, the, world, among, the, tanks, of, the, 1950s, were, the, british, centurion, and, soviet, t, 54, 55, in, service, from, 1946, and, the, us, m48, from, 1951, these, three, vehicles, formed, the, bulk, of, the, armoured, forces, of, nato, and, the, warsaw, pact, throughout, much, of, the, cold, war, lessons, learned, from, tanks, such, as, the, leopard, 1, m48, patton, series, chieftain, and, t, 72, led, to, the, contemporary, leopard, 2, m1, abrams, challenger, 2, c1, ariete, t, 90, and, merkava, iv, tanks, and, anti, tank, weapons, of, the, cold, war, era, saw, action, in, a, number, of, proxy, wars, like, the, korean, war, vietnam, war, indo, pakistani, war, of, 1971, soviet, afghan, war, and, arab, israeli, conflicts, culminating, with, the, yom, kippur, war, the, t, 55, for, example, has, seen, action, in, no, fewer, than, 32, conflicts, in, these, wars, the, u, s, or, nato, countries, and, the, soviet, union, or, china, consistently, backed, opposing, forces, proxy, wars, were, studied, by, western, and, soviet, military, analysts, and, provided, a, contribution, to, the, cold, war, tank, development, process, the, role, of, tank, vs, tank, combat, is, becoming, diminished, tanks, work, in, concert, with, infantry, in, urban, warfare, by, deploying, them, ahead, of, the, platoon, when, engaging, enemy, infantry, tanks, can, provide, covering, fire, on, the, battlefield, conversely, tanks, can, spearhead, attacks, when, infantry, are, deployed, in, personnel, carriers, tanks, were, used, to, spearhead, the, initial, us, invasion, of, iraq, in, 2003, as, of, 2005, there, were, 1, 100, m1, abrams, used, by, the, united, states, army, in, the, course, of, the, iraq, war, and, they, have, proven, to, have, an, unexpectedly, high, level, of, vulnerability, to, roadside, bombs, a, relatively, new, type, of, remotely, detonated, mine, the, explosively, formed, penetrator, has, been, used, with, some, success, against, american, armoured, vehicles, particularly, the, bradley, fighting, vehicle, however, with, upgrades, to, their, armour, in, the, rear, m1s, have, proven, invaluable, in, fighting, insurgents, in, urban, combat, particularly, at, the, battle, of, fallujah, where, the, us, marines, brought, in, two, extra, brigades, israeli, merkava, tanks, contain, features, that, enable, them, to, support, infantry, in, low, intensity, conflicts, lic, and, counter, terrorism, operations, such, features, are, the, rear, door, and, rear, corridor, enabling, the, tank, to, carry, infantry, and, embark, safely, the, imi, apam, mp, t, multi, purpose, ammunition, round, advanced, c4is, systems, and, recently, trophy, active, protection, system, which, protects, the, tank, from, shoulder, launched, anti, tank, weapons, during, the, second, intifada, further, modifications, were, made, designated, as, merkava, mk, 3d, baz, lic, in, terms, of, firepower, the, focus, of, 2010s, era, r, d, was, increased, detection, capability, such, as, thermal, imagers, automated, fire, control, systems, for, the, guns, and, increased, muzzle, energy, from, the, gun, to, improve, range, accuracy, and, armour, penetration, the, most, mature, future, gun, technology, is, the, electrothermal, chemical, gun, the, xm291, electrothermal, chemical, tank, gun, has, gone, through, successful, multiple, firing, sequences, on, a, modified, american, m8, armored, gun, system, chassis, to, improve, tank, protection, one, field, of, research, involves, making, the, tank, invisible, to, radar, by, adapting, stealth, technologies, originally, designed, for, aircraft, improvements, to, camouflage, or, and, attempts, to, render, it, invisible, through, active, camouflage, which, changes, according, to, where, the, tank, is, located, are, being, pursued, research, is, also, ongoing, in, electromagnetic, armour, systems, to, disperse, or, deflect, incoming, shaped, charges, as, well, as, various, forms, of, active, protection, systems, to, prevent, incoming, projectiles, rpgs, missiles, etc, from, striking, the, tank, mobility, may, be, enhanced, in, future, tanks, by, the, use, of, diesel, electric, or, turbine, electric, series, hybrid, drives, first, used, in, a, primitive, gasoline, engined, form, with, porsche, s, elefant, german, tank, destroyer, of, 1943, improving, fuel, efficiency, while, reducing, the, size, and, weight, of, the, power, plant, furthermore, advances, in, gas, turbine, technology, including, the, use, of, advanced, recuperators, have, allowed, for, reduction, in, engine, volume, and, mass, to, less, than, 1, m, 3, and, 1, metric, ton, respectively, while, maintaining, fuel, efficiency, similar, to, that, of, a, diesel, engine, in, line, with, the, new, doctrine, of, network, centric, warfare, the, 2010s, era, modern, battle, tank, shows, increasing, sophistication, in, its, electronics, and, communication, systems, the, future, of, tanks, has, been, challenged, by, the, proliferation, of, relatively, inexpensive, anti, tank, guided, missiles, and, rockets, during, the, russo, ukrainian, war, the, three, traditional, factors, determining, a, tank, s, capability, effectiveness, are, its, firepower, protection, and, mobility, firepower, is, the, ability, of, a, tank, s, crew, to, identify, engage, and, destroy, enemy, tanks, and, other, targets, using, its, large, caliber, cannon, protection, is, the, degree, to, which, the, tank, s, armour, profile, and, camouflage, enables, the, tank, crew, to, evade, detection, protect, themselves, from, enemy, fire, and, retain, vehicle, functionality, during, and, after, combat, mobility, includes, how, well, the, tank, can, be, transported, by, rail, sea, or, air, to, the, operational, staging, area, from, the, staging, area, by, road, or, over, terrain, towards, the, enemy, and, tactical, movement, by, the, tank, over, the, battlefield, during, combat, including, traversing, of, obstacles, and, rough, terrain, the, variations, of, tank, designs, have, been, determined, by, the, way, these, three, fundamental, features, are, blended, for, instance, in, 1937, the, french, doctrine, focused, on, firepower, and, protection, more, than, mobility, because, tanks, worked, in, intimate, liaison, with, the, infantry, there, was, also, the, case, of, the, development, of, a, heavy, cruiser, tank, which, focused, on, armour, and, firepower, to, challenge, germany, s, tiger, and, panther, tanks, tanks, have, been, classified, by, weight, role, or, other, criteria, that, has, changed, over, time, and, place, classification, is, determined, by, the, prevailing, theories, of, armoured, warfare, which, have, been, altered, in, turn, by, rapid, advances, in, technology, no, one, classification, system, works, across, all, periods, or, all, nations, in, particular, weight, based, classification, is, inconsistent, between, countries, and, eras, in, world, war, i, the, first, tank, designs, focused, on, crossing, wide, trenches, requiring, very, long, and, large, vehicles, such, as, the, british, mark, i, these, became, classified, as, heavy, tanks, tanks, that, fulfilled, other, combat, roles, were, smaller, like, the, french, renault, ft, these, were, classified, as, light, tanks, or, tankettes, many, late, war, and, inter, war, tank, designs, diverged, from, these, according, to, new, though, mostly, untried, concepts, for, future, tank, roles, and, tactics, tank, classifications, varied, considerably, according, to, each, nation, s, own, tank, development, such, as, cavalry, tanks, fast, tanks, and, breakthrough, tanks, during, world, war, ii, many, tank, concepts, were, found, unsatisfactory, and, discarded, mostly, leaving, the, more, multi, role, tanks, these, became, easier, to, classify, tank, classes, based, on, weight, and, the, corresponding, transport, and, logistical, needs, led, to, new, definitions, of, heavy, and, light, tank, classes, with, medium, tanks, covering, the, balance, of, those, between, the, british, maintained, cruiser, tanks, focused, on, speed, and, infantry, tanks, that, traded, speed, for, more, armour, tank, destroyers, are, tanks, or, other, armoured, fighting, vehicles, specifically, designed, to, defeat, enemy, tanks, assault, guns, are, armoured, fighting, vehicles, that, could, combine, the, roles, of, infantry, tanks, and, tank, destroyers, some, tanks, were, converted, to, flame, tanks, specializing, on, close, in, attacks, on, enemy, strongholds, with, flamethrowers, as, the, war, went, on, tanks, tended, to, become, larger, and, more, powerful, shifting, some, tank, classifications, and, leading, to, super, heavy, tanks, experience, and, technology, advances, during, the, cold, war, continued, to, consolidate, tank, roles, with, the, worldwide, adoption, of, the, modern, main, battle, tank, designs, which, favour, a, modular, universal, design, most, other, classifications, are, dropped, from, modern, terminology, all, main, battle, tanks, tend, to, have, a, good, balance, of, speed, armour, and, firepower, even, while, technology, continues, to, improve, all, three, being, fairly, large, main, battle, tanks, can, be, complemented, with, light, tanks, armoured, personnel, carriers, infantry, fighting, vehicles, or, similar, relatively, lighter, armoured, fighting, vehicles, typically, in, the, roles, of, armoured, reconnaissance, amphibious, or, air, assault, operations, or, against, enemies, lacking, main, battle, tanks, the, main, weapon, of, modern, tanks, is, typically, a, single, large, caliber, cannon, mounted, in, a, fully, traversing, rotating, gun, turret, the, typical, modern, tank, gun, is, a, smoothbore, weapon, capable, of, firing, a, variety, of, ammunition, including, armour, piercing, kinetic, energy, penetrators, kep, also, known, as, armour, piercing, discarding, sabot, apds, and, or, armour, piercing, fin, stabilized, discarding, sabot, apfsds, and, high, explosive, anti, tank, heat, shells, and, or, high, explosive, squash, head, hesh, and, or, anti, tank, guided, missiles, atgm, to, destroy, armoured, targets, as, well, as, high, explosive, he, shells, for, shooting, at, soft, targets, unarmoured, vehicles, or, troops, or, fortifications, canister, shot, may, be, used, in, close, or, urban, combat, situations, where, the, risk, of, hitting, friendly, forces, with, shrapnel, from, he, rounds, is, unacceptably, high, a, gyroscope, is, used, to, stabilise, the, main, gun, allowing, it, to, be, effectively, aimed, and, fired, at, the, short, halt, or, on, the, move, modern, tank, guns, are, also, commonly, fitted, with, insulating, thermal, sleeves, to, reduce, gun, barrel, warping, caused, by, uneven, thermal, expansion, bore, evacuators, to, minimise, gun, firing, fumes, entering, the, crew, compartment, and, sometimes, muzzle, brakes, to, minimise, the, effect, of, recoil, on, accuracy, and, rate, of, fire, traditionally, target, detection, relied, on, visual, identification, this, was, accomplished, from, within, the, tank, through, telescopic, periscopes, often, however, tank, commanders, would, open, up, the, hatch, to, view, the, outside, surroundings, which, improved, situational, awareness, but, incurred, the, penalty, of, vulnerability, to, sniper, fire, though, several, developments, in, target, detection, have, taken, place, these, methods, are, still, common, practice, in, the, 2010s, more, electronic, target, detection, methods, are, available, in, some, cases, spotting, rifles, were, used, to, confirm, proper, trajectory, and, range, to, a, target, these, spotting, rifles, were, mounted, co, axially, to, the, main, gun, and, fired, tracer, ammunition, ballistically, matched, to, the, gun, itself, the, gunner, would, track, the, movement, of, the, tracer, round, in, flight, and, upon, impact, with, a, hard, surface, it, would, give, off, a, flash, and, a, puff, of, smoke, after, which, the, main, gun, was, immediately, fired, however, this, slow, method, has, been, mostly, superseded, by, laser, rangefinding, equipment, modern, tanks, also, use, sophisticated, light, intensification, and, thermal, imaging, equipment, to, improve, fighting, capability, at, night, in, poor, weather, and, in, smoke, the, accuracy, of, modern, tank, guns, is, pushed, to, the, mechanical, limit, by, computerized, fire, control, systems, a, fire, control, system, uses, a, laser, rangefinder, to, determine, the, range, to, the, target, a, thermocouple, anemometer, and, wind, vane, to, correct, for, weather, effects, and, a, muzzle, referencing, system, to, correct, for, gun, barrel, temperature, warping, and, wear, two, sightings, of, a, target, with, the, range, finder, enable, calculation, of, the, target, movement, vector, this, information, is, combined, with, the, known, movement, of, the, tank, and, the, principles, of, ballistics, to, calculate, the, elevation, and, aim, point, that, maximises, the, probability, of, hitting, the, target, usually, tanks, carry, smaller, caliber, armament, for, short, range, defense, where, fire, from, the, main, weapon, would, be, ineffective, or, wasteful, for, example, when, engaging, infantry, light, vehicles, or, close, air, support, aircraft, a, typical, complement, of, secondary, weapons, is, a, general, purpose, machine, gun, mounted, coaxially, with, the, main, gun, and, a, heavier, anti, aircraft, capable, machine, gun, on, the, turret, roof, some, tanks, also, have, a, hull, mounted, machine, gun, these, weapons, are, often, modified, variants, of, those, used, by, infantry, and, so, use, the, same, kinds, of, ammunition, the, measure, of, a, tank, s, protection, is, the, combination, of, its, ability, to, avoid, detection, due, to, having, a, low, profile, and, through, the, use, of, camouflage, to, avoid, being, hit, by, enemy, fire, its, resistance, to, the, effects, of, enemy, fire, and, its, capacity, to, sustain, damage, whilst, still, completing, its, objective, or, at, least, protecting, its, crew, this, is, done, by, a, variety, of, countermeasures, such, as, armour, plating, and, reactive, defenses, as, well, as, more, complex, ones, such, as, heat, emissions, reduction, in, common, with, most, unit, types, tanks, are, subject, to, additional, hazards, in, dense, wooded, and, urban, combat, environments, which, largely, negate, the, advantages, of, the, tank, s, long, range, firepower, and, mobility, limit, the, crew, s, detection, capabilities, and, can, restrict, turret, traverse, despite, these, disadvantages, tanks, retain, high, survivability, against, previous, generation, rocket, propelled, grenades, aimed, at, the, most, armoured, sections, however, as, effective, and, advanced, as, armour, plating, has, become, tank, survivability, against, newer, generation, tandem, warhead, anti, tank, missiles, is, a, concern, for, military, planners, tandem, warhead, rpgs, use, two, warheads, to, fool, active, protection, systems, a, first, dummy, warhead, is, fired, first, to, trigger, the, active, defenses, with, the, real, warhead, following, it, for, example, the, rpg, 29, from, the, 1980s, is, able, to, penetrate, the, frontal, hull, armour, of, the, challenger, ii, and, also, managed, to, damage, a, m1, abrams, as, well, even, tanks, with, advanced, armour, plating, can, have, their, tracks, or, gear, cogs, damaged, by, rpgs, which, may, render, them, immobile, or, hinder, their, mobility, despite, all, of, the, advances, in, armour, plating, a, tank, with, its, hatches, open, remains, vulnerable, to, molotov, cocktail, gasoline, bombs, and, grenades, even, a, buttoned, up, tank, may, have, components, which, are, vulnerable, to, molotov, cocktails, such, as, optics, extra, gas, cans, and, extra, ammunition, stored, on, the, outside, of, the, tank, a, tank, avoids, detection, using, the, doctrine, of, countermeasures, known, as, ccd, camouflage, looks, the, same, as, the, surroundings, concealment, cannot, be, seen, and, deception, looks, like, something, else, camouflage, can, include, disruptive, painted, shapes, on, the, tank, to, break, up, the, distinctive, appearance, and, silhouette, of, a, tank, netting, or, actual, branches, from, the, surrounding, landscape, are, also, used, prior, to, development, of, infrared, technology, tanks, were, often, given, a, coating, of, camouflage, paint, that, depending, on, environmental, region, or, season, would, allow, it, to, blend, in, with, the, rest, of, its, environment, a, tank, operating, in, wooded, areas, would, typically, get, a, green, and, brown, paintjob, a, tank, in, a, winter, environment, would, get, white, paint, often, mixed, with, some, darker, colors, tanks, in, the, desert, often, get, khaki, paintjobs, the, russian, nakidka, camouflage, kit, was, designed, to, reduce, the, optical, thermal, infrared, and, radar, signatures, of, a, tank, so, that, acquisition, of, the, tank, would, be, difficult, according, to, nii, stali, the, designers, of, nakidka, nakidka, would, reduce, the, probabilities, of, detection, via, visual, and, near, ir, bands, by, 30, the, thermal, band, by, 2, 3, fold, radar, band, by, 6, fold, and, radar, thermal, band, to, near, background, levels, concealment, can, include, hiding, the, tank, among, trees, or, digging, in, the, tank, by, having, a, combat, bulldozer, dig, out, part, of, a, hill, so, that, much, of, the, tank, will, be, hidden, a, tank, commander, can, conceal, the, tank, by, using, hull, down, approaches, to, going, over, upward, sloping, hills, so, that, she, or, he, can, look, out, the, commander, s, cupola, without, the, distinctive, looking, main, cannon, cresting, over, the, hill, adopting, a, turret, down, or, hull, down, position, reduces, the, visible, silhouette, of, a, tank, as, well, as, providing, the, added, protection, of, a, position, in, defilade, working, against, efforts, to, avoid, detection, is, the, fact, that, a, tank, is, a, large, metallic, object, with, a, distinctive, angular, silhouette, that, emits, copious, heat, and, engine, noise, a, tank, that, is, operating, in, cold, weather, or, which, needs, to, use, its, radio, or, other, communications, or, target, detecting, electronics, will, need, to, start, its, engine, regularly, to, maintain, its, battery, power, which, will, create, engine, noise, consequently, it, is, difficult, to, effectively, camouflage, a, tank, in, the, absence, of, some, form, of, cover, or, concealment, e, g, woods, it, can, hide, its, hull, behind, the, tank, becomes, easier, to, detect, when, moving, typically, whenever, it, is, in, use, due, to, the, large, distinctive, auditory, vibration, and, thermal, signature, of, its, engine, and, power, plant, tank, tracks, and, dust, clouds, also, betray, past, or, present, tank, movement, switched, off, tanks, are, vulnerable, to, infra, red, detection, due, to, differences, between, the, thermal, conductivity, and, therefore, heat, dissipation, of, the, metallic, tank, and, its, surroundings, at, close, range, the, tank, can, be, detected, even, when, powered, down, and, fully, concealed, due, to, the, column, of, warmer, air, above, the, tank, and, the, smell, of, diesel, or, gasoline, thermal, blankets, slow, the, rate, of, heat, emission, and, some, thermal, camouflage, nets, use, a, mix, of, materials, with, differing, thermal, properties, to, operate, in, the, infra, red, as, well, as, the, visible, spectrum, grenade, launchers, can, rapidly, deploy, a, smoke, screen, that, is, opaque, to, infrared, light, to, hide, it, from, the, thermal, viewer, of, another, tank, in, addition, to, using, its, own, grenade, launchers, a, tank, commander, could, call, in, an, artillery, unit, to, provide, smoke, cover, some, tanks, can, produce, a, smoke, screen, sometimes, camouflage, and, concealment, are, used, at, the, same, time, for, example, a, camouflage, painted, and, branch, covered, tank, camouflage, may, be, hidden, in, a, behind, a, hill, or, in, a, dug, in, emplacement, concealment, some, armoured, recovery, vehicles, often, tracked, tank, chassis, based, tow, trucks, for, tanks, have, dummy, turrets, and, cannons, this, makes, it, less, likely, that, enemy, tanks, will, fire, on, these, vehicles, some, armies, have, fake, dummy, tanks, made, of, wood, which, troops, can, carry, into, position, and, hide, behind, obstacles, these, dummy, tanks, may, cause, the, enemy, to, think, that, there, are, more, tanks, than, are, actually, possessed, to, effectively, protect, the, tank, and, its, crew, tank, armour, must, counter, a, wide, variety, of, antitank, threats, protection, against, kinetic, energy, penetrators, and, high, explosive, anti, tank, heat, shells, fired, by, other, tanks, is, of, primary, importance, but, tank, armour, also, aims, to, protect, against, infantry, mortars, grenades, rocket, propelled, grenades, anti, tank, guided, missiles, anti, tank, mines, anti, tank, rifles, bombs, direct, artillery, hits, and, less, often, nuclear, biological, and, chemical, threats, any, of, which, could, disable, or, destroy, a, tank, or, its, crew, steel, armour, plate, was, the, earliest, type, of, armour, the, germans, pioneered, the, use, of, face, hardened, steel, during, world, war, ii, and, the, soviets, also, achieved, improved, protection, with, sloped, armour, technology, world, war, ii, developments, led, to, the, obsolescence, of, homogeneous, steel, armour, with, the, development, of, shaped, charge, warheads, exemplified, by, the, panzerfaust, and, bazooka, infantry, carried, weapons, which, were, effective, despite, some, early, success, with, spaced, armour, magnetic, mines, led, to, the, development, of, anti, magnetic, paste, and, paint, from, wwii, to, the, modern, era, troops, have, added, improvised, armour, to, tanks, while, in, combat, settings, such, as, sandbags, or, pieces, of, old, armour, plating, british, tank, researchers, took, the, next, step, with, the, development, of, chobham, armour, or, more, generally, composite, armour, incorporating, ceramics, and, plastics, in, a, resin, matrix, between, steel, plates, which, provided, good, protection, against, heat, weapons, high, explosive, squash, head, warheads, led, to, anti, spall, armour, linings, and, kinetic, energy, penetrators, led, to, the, inclusion, of, exotic, materials, like, a, matrix, of, depleted, uranium, into, a, composite, armour, configuration, reactive, armour, consists, of, small, explosive, filled, metal, boxes, that, detonate, when, hit, by, the, metallic, jet, projected, by, an, exploding, heat, warhead, causing, their, metal, plates, to, disrupt, it, tandem, warheads, defeat, reactive, armour, by, causing, the, armour, to, detonate, prematurely, modern, reactive, armour, protects, itself, from, tandem, warheads, by, having, a, thicker, front, metal, plate, to, prevent, the, precursor, charge, from, detonating, the, explosive, in, the, reactive, armour, reactive, armours, can, also, reduce, the, penetrative, abilities, of, kinetic, energy, penetrators, by, deforming, the, penetrator, with, the, metal, plates, on, the, reactive, armour, thereby, reducing, its, effectiveness, against, the, main, armour, of, the, tank, the, latest, generation, of, protective, measures, for, tanks, are, active, protection, systems, the, term, active, is, used, to, contrast, these, approaches, with, the, armour, used, as, the, primary, protective, approach, in, earlier, tanks, the, mobility, of, a, tank, is, described, by, its, battlefield, or, tactical, mobility, its, operational, mobility, and, its, strategic, mobility, tank, agility, is, a, function, of, the, weight, of, the, tank, due, to, its, inertia, while, manoeuvring, and, its, ground, pressure, the, power, output, of, the, installed, power, plant, and, the, tank, transmission, and, track, design, in, addition, rough, terrain, effectively, limits, the, tank, s, speed, through, the, stress, it, puts, on, the, suspension, and, the, crew, a, breakthrough, in, this, area, was, achieved, during, world, war, ii, when, improved, suspension, systems, were, developed, that, allowed, better, cross, country, performance, and, limited, firing, on, the, move, systems, like, the, earlier, christie, or, later, torsion, bar, suspension, developed, by, ferdinand, porsche, dramatically, improved, the, tank, s, cross, country, performance, and, overall, mobility, tanks, are, highly, mobile, and, able, to, travel, over, most, types, of, terrain, due, to, their, continuous, tracks, and, advanced, suspension, the, tracks, disperse, the, weight, of, the, vehicle, over, a, large, area, resulting, in, less, ground, pressure, a, tank, can, travel, at, approximately, 40, kilometres, per, hour, 25, mph, across, flat, terrain, and, up, to, 70, kilometres, per, hour, 43, mph, on, roads, but, due, to, the, mechanical, strain, this, places, on, the, vehicle, and, the, logistical, strain, on, fuel, delivery, and, tank, maintenance, these, must, be, considered, burst, speeds, that, invite, mechanical, failure, of, engine, and, transmission, systems, consequently, wheeled, tank, transporters, and, rail, infrastructure, is, used, wherever, possible, for, long, distance, tank, transport, the, limitations, of, long, range, tank, mobility, can, be, viewed, in, sharp, contrast, to, that, of, wheeled, armoured, fighting, vehicles, the, majority, of, blitzkrieg, operations, were, conducted, at, the, pedestrian, pace, of, 5, kilometres, per, hour, 3, 1, mph, and, that, was, only, achieved, on, the, roads, of, france, the, tank, s, power, plant, supplies, kinetic, energy, to, move, the, tank, and, electric, power, via, a, generator, to, components, such, as, the, turret, rotation, motors, and, the, tank, s, electronic, systems, the, tank, power, plant, evolved, from, predominantly, petrol, and, adapted, large, displacement, aeronautical, or, automotive, engines, to, diesel, engines, japan, was, the, first, to, begin, transitioning, to, this, engine, type, beginning, with, the, type, 89b, in, 1934, the, main, advantage, of, diesel, is, their, higher, fuel, economy, which, allows, for, greater, operating, ranges, diesel, engines, can, also, run, on, a, variety, of, fuels, such, as, aviation, kerosene, and, even, gasoline, advanced, multi, fuel, diesel, engines, have, been, adopted, powerful, per, unit, weight, but, fuel, hungry, gas, turbines, have, seen, some, limited, use, namely, by, the, soviet, t, 80, and, american, m1, abrams, the, transition, from, petrol, to, diesel, in, the, absence, of, combat, engineers, most, tanks, are, limited, to, fording, small, rivers, the, typical, fording, depth, for, mbts, is, approximately, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, being, limited, by, the, height, of, the, engine, air, intake, and, driver, s, position, modern, tanks, such, as, the, russian, t, 90, and, the, german, leopard, 1, and, leopard, 2, tanks, can, ford, to, a, depth, of, 3, to, 4, m, 9, 8, to, 13, 1, ft, when, properly, prepared, and, equipped, with, a, snorkel, to, supply, air, for, the, crew, and, engine, tank, crews, usually, have, a, negative, reaction, towards, deep, fording, but, it, adds, considerable, scope, for, surprise, and, tactical, flexibility, in, water, crossing, operations, by, opening, new, and, unexpected, avenues, of, attack, amphibious, tanks, are, specially, designed, or, adapted, for, water, operations, such, as, by, including, snorkels, and, skirts, but, they, are, rare, in, modern, armies, being, replaced, by, purpose, built, amphibious, assault, vehicles, or, armoured, personnel, carriers, in, amphibious, assaults, advances, such, as, the, efa, mobile, bridge, and, armoured, vehicle, launched, scissors, bridges, have, also, reduced, the, impediment, to, tank, advance, that, rivers, posed, in, world, war, ii, most, modern, tanks, most, often, have, four, crew, members, or, three, if, an, auto, loader, is, installed, these, are, the, operating, a, tank, is, a, team, effort, for, example, the, loader, is, assisted, by, the, rest, of, the, crew, in, stowing, ammunition, the, driver, is, assisted, in, maintaining, the, automotive, features, historically, crews, have, varied, from, just, two, members, to, a, dozen, first, world, war, tanks, were, developed, with, immature, technologies, in, addition, to, the, crew, needed, to, man, the, multiple, guns, and, machine, guns, up, to, four, crewmen, were, needed, to, drive, the, tank, the, driver, acting, as, the, vehicle, commander, and, manning, the, brakes, drove, via, orders, to, his, gears, men, a, co, driver, operated, the, gearbox, and, throttle, and, two, gears, men, one, on, each, track, steered, by, setting, one, side, or, the, other, to, idle, allowing, the, track, on, the, other, side, to, slew, the, tank, to, one, side, pre, world, war, ii, french, tanks, were, noted, for, having, a, two, man, crew, in, which, the, overworked, commander, had, to, load, and, fire, the, gun, in, addition, to, commanding, the, tank, with, world, war, ii, the, multi, turreted, tanks, proved, impracticable, and, as, the, single, turret, on, a, low, hull, design, became, standard, crews, became, standardized, around, a, crew, of, four, or, five, in, those, tanks, with, a, fifth, crew, member, usually, three, were, located, in, the, turret, as, described, above, while, the, fifth, was, most, often, seated, in, the, hull, next, to, the, driver, and, operated, the, hull, machine, gun, in, addition, to, acting, as, a, co, driver, or, radio, operator, well, designed, crew, stations, giving, proper, considerations, to, comfort, and, ergonomics, are, an, important, factor, in, the, combat, effectiveness, of, a, tank, as, it, limits, fatigue, and, speeds, up, individual, actions, a, noted, author, on, the, subject, of, tank, design, engineering, richard, ogorkiewicz, outlined, the, following, basic, engineering, sub, systems, that, are, commonly, incorporated, into, tank, s, technological, development, to, the, above, can, be, added, unit, communication, systems, and, electronic, anti, tank, countermeasures, crew, ergonomic, and, survival, systems, including, flame, suppression, and, provision, for, technological, upgrading, few, tank, designs, have, survived, their, entire, service, lives, without, some, upgrading, or, modernization, particularly, during, wartime, including, some, that, have, changed, almost, beyond, recognition, such, as, the, latest, israeli, magach, versions, the, characteristics, of, a, tank, are, determined, by, the, performance, criteria, required, for, the, tank, the, obstacles, that, must, be, traversed, affect, the, vehicles, front, and, rear, profiles, the, terrain, that, is, expected, to, be, traversed, determines, the, track, ground, pressure, that, may, be, allowed, to, be, exerted, for, that, particular, terrain, tank, design, is, a, compromise, between, its, technological, and, budgetary, constraints, and, its, tactical, capability, requirements, it, is, not, possible, to, maximise, firepower, protection, and, mobility, simultaneously, while, incorporating, the, latest, technology, and, retain, affordability, for, sufficient, procurement, quantity, to, enter, production, for, example, in, the, case, of, tactical, capability, requirements, increasing, protection, by, adding, armour, will, result, in, an, increase, in, weight, and, therefore, decrease, in, mobility, increasing, firepower, by, installing, a, larger, gun, will, force, the, designer, team, to, increase, armour, the, therefore, weight, of, the, tank, by, retaining, same, internal, volume, to, ensure, crew, efficiency, during, combat, in, the, case, of, the, abrams, mbt, which, has, good, firepower, speed, and, armour, these, advantages, are, counterbalanced, by, its, engine, s, notably, high, fuel, consumption, which, ultimately, reduces, its, range, and, in, a, larger, sense, its, mobility, since, the, second, world, war, the, economics, of, tank, production, governed, by, the, complexity, of, manufacture, and, cost, and, the, impact, of, a, given, tank, design, on, logistics, and, field, maintenance, capabilities, have, also, been, accepted, as, important, in, determining, how, many, tanks, a, nation, can, afford, to, field, in, its, force, structure, some, tank, designs, that, were, fielded, in, significant, numbers, such, as, tiger, i, and, m60a2, proved, to, be, too, complex, or, expensive, to, manufacture, and, made, unsustainable, demands, on, the, logistics, services, support, of, the, armed, forces, the, affordability, of, the, design, therefore, takes, precedence, over, the, combat, capability, requirements, nowhere, was, this, principle, illustrated, better, than, during, the, second, world, war, when, two, allied, designs, the, t, 34, and, the, m4, sherman, although, both, simple, designs, which, accepted, engineering, compromises, were, used, successfully, against, more, sophisticated, designs, by, germany, that, were, more, complex, and, expensive, to, produce, and, more, demanding, on, overstretched, logistics, of, the, wehrmacht, given, that, a, tank, crew, will, spend, most, of, its, time, occupied, with, maintenance, of, the, vehicle, engineering, simplicity, has, become, the, primary, constraint, on, tank, design, since, the, second, world, war, despite, advances, in, mechanical, electrical, and, electronics, technologies, since, the, second, world, war, tank, development, has, incorporated, experimenting, with, significant, mechanical, changes, to, the, tank, design, while, focusing, on, technological, advances, in, the, tank, s, many, subsystems, to, improve, its, performance, however, a, number, of, novel, designs, have, appeared, throughout, this, period, with, mixed, success, including, the, soviet, it, 1, and, t, 64, in, firepower, and, the, israeli, merkava, and, swedish, s, tank, in, protection, while, for, decades, the, us, s, m551, remained, the, only, light, tank, deployable, by, parachute, commanding, and, coordinating, tanks, in, the, field, has, always, been, subject, to, particular, problems, particularly, in, the, area, of, communications, but, in, modern, armies, these, problems, have, been, partially, alleviated, by, networked, integrated, systems, that, enable, communications, and, contribute, to, enhanced, situational, awareness, armoured, bulkheads, engine, noise, intervening, terrain, dust, and, smoke, and, the, need, to, operate, with, hatches, closed, are, severe, detriments, to, communication, and, lead, to, a, sense, of, isolation, for, small, tank, units, individual, vehicles, and, tank, crew, radios, were, not, portable, or, robust, enough, to, be, mounted, in, a, tank, although, morse, code, transmitters, were, installed, in, some, mark, ivs, at, cambrai, as, messaging, vehicles, the, mounting, of, a, field, telephone, to, the, rear, was, not, a, practice, during, world, war, i, when, these, failed, or, were, unavailable, situation, reports, were, sent, back, to, headquarters, by, some, crews, releasing, carrier, pigeons, through, loopholes, or, hatches, and, communications, between, vehicles, was, accomplished, using, hand, signals, handheld, semaphore, flags, which, continued, in, use, in, the, red, army, soviet, army, through, the, second, and, cold, wars, or, by, foot, or, horse, mounted, messengers, from, the, beginning, the, german, military, stressed, wireless, communications, equipping, their, combat, vehicles, with, radios, and, drilled, all, units, to, rely, on, disciplined, radio, use, as, a, basic, element, of, tactics, this, allowed, them, to, respond, to, developing, threats, and, opportunities, during, battles, giving, the, germans, a, notable, tactical, advantage, early, in, the, war, even, where, allied, tanks, initially, had, better, firepower, and, armour, they, generally, lacked, individual, radios, by, mid, war, western, allied, tanks, adopted, full, use, of, radios, although, russian, use, of, radios, remained, relatively, limited, on, the, modern, battlefield, an, intercom, mounted, in, the, crew, helmet, provides, internal, communications, and, a, link, to, the, radio, network, and, on, some, tanks, an, external, intercom, on, the, rear, of, the, tank, provides, communication, with, co, operating, infantry, radio, networks, employ, radio, voice, procedure, to, minimize, confusion, and, chatter, a, recent, development, in, afv, equipment, and, doctrine, is, integration, of, information, from, the, fire, control, system, laser, rangefinder, global, positioning, system, and, terrain, information, via, hardened, military, specification, electronics, and, a, battlefield, network, to, display, information, on, enemy, targets, and, friendly, units, on, a, monitor, in, the, tank, the, sensor, data, can, be, sourced, from, nearby, tanks, planes, uavs, or, in, the, future, infantry, such, as, the, us, future, force, warrior, project, this, improves, the, tank, commander, s, situational, awareness, and, ability, to, navigate, the, battlefield, and, select, and, engage, targets, in, addition, to, easing, the, reporting, burden, by, automatically, logging, all, orders, and, actions, orders, are, sent, via, the, network, with,

tanks, including, the, k, 2, black, panther, have, taken, up, the, first, major, step, forward, in, adopting, a, fully, radar, integrated, fire, control, system, which, allows, it, to, detect, tanks, from, a, further, distance, and, identify, it, as, a, friend, or, foe, as, well, as, increasing, the, tank, s, accuracy, as, well, as, its, capability, to, lock, onto, tanks, performing, situational,
