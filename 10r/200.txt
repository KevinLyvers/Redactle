wind, power, is, the, use, of, wind, energy, to, generate, useful, work, historically, wind, power, was, used, by, sails, windmills, and, windpumps, but, today, it, is, mostly, used, to, generate, electricity, this, article, deals, only, with, wind, power, for, electricity, generation, today, wind, power, is, generated, almost, completely, with, wind, turbines, generally, grouped, into, wind, farms, and, connected, to, the, electrical, grid, in, 2022, wind, supplied, over, 2, 304, twh, of, electricity, which, was, 7, 8, of, world, electricity, with, about, 100, gw, added, during, 2021, mostly, in, china, and, the, united, states, global, installed, wind, power, capacity, exceeded, 800, gw, 32, countries, generated, more, than, a, tenth, of, their, electricity, from, wind, power, in, 2023, and, wind, generation, has, nearly, tripled, since, 2015, to, help, meet, the, paris, agreement, goals, to, limit, climate, change, analysts, say, it, should, expand, much, faster, by, over, 1, of, electricity, generation, per, year, wind, power, is, considered, a, sustainable, renewable, energy, source, and, has, a, much, smaller, impact, on, the, environment, compared, to, burning, fossil, fuels, wind, power, is, variable, so, it, needs, energy, storage, or, other, dispatchable, generation, energy, sources, to, attain, a, reliable, supply, of, electricity, land, based, onshore, wind, farms, have, a, greater, visual, impact, on, the, landscape, than, most, other, power, stations, per, energy, produced, wind, farms, sited, offshore, have, less, visual, impact, and, have, higher, capacity, factors, although, they, are, generally, more, expensive, offshore, wind, power, currently, has, a, share, of, about, 10, of, new, installations, wind, power, is, one, of, the, lowest, cost, electricity, sources, per, unit, of, energy, produced, in, many, locations, new, onshore, wind, farms, are, cheaper, than, new, coal, or, gas, plants, regions, in, the, higher, northern, and, southern, latitudes, have, the, highest, potential, for, wind, power, in, most, regions, wind, power, generation, is, higher, in, nighttime, and, in, winter, when, solar, power, output, is, low, for, this, reason, combinations, of, wind, and, solar, power, are, suitable, in, many, countries, wind, is, air, movement, in, the, earth, s, atmosphere, in, a, unit, of, time, say, 1, second, the, volume, of, air, that, had, passed, an, area, a, displaystyle, a, is, a, v, displaystyle, av, if, the, air, density, is, displaystyle, rho, the, mass, of, this, volume, of, air, is, m, a, v, displaystyle, m, rho, av, and, the, power, transfer, or, energy, transfer, per, second, is, p, 1, 2, m, v, 2, 1, 2, a, v, 3, displaystyle, p, tfrac, 1, 2, mv, 2, tfrac, 1, 2, rho, av, 3, wind, power, is, thus, proportional, to, the, third, power, of, the, wind, speed, the, available, power, increases, eightfold, when, the, wind, speed, doubles, change, of, wind, speed, by, a, factor, of, 2, 1544, increases, the, wind, power, by, one, order, of, magnitude, multiply, by, 10, the, global, wind, kinetic, energy, averaged, approximately, 1, 50, mj, m, 2, over, the, period, from, 1979, to, 2010, 1, 31, mj, m, 2, in, the, northern, hemisphere, with, 1, 70, mj, m, 2, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, atmosphere, acts, as, a, thermal, engine, absorbing, heat, at, higher, temperatures, releasing, heat, at, lower, temperatures, the, process, is, responsible, for, the, production, of, wind, kinetic, energy, at, a, rate, of, 2, 46, w, m, 2, thus, sustaining, the, circulation, of, the, atmosphere, against, friction, through, wind, resource, assessment, it, is, possible, to, estimate, wind, power, potential, globally, by, country, or, region, or, for, a, specific, site, the, global, wind, atlas, provided, by, the, technical, university, of, denmark, in, partnership, with, the, world, bank, provides, a, global, assessment, of, wind, power, potential, unlike, static, wind, resource, atlases, which, average, estimates, of, wind, speed, and, power, density, across, multiple, years, tools, such, as, renewables, ninja, provide, time, varying, simulations, of, wind, speed, and, power, output, from, different, wind, turbine, models, at, an, hourly, resolution, more, detailed, site, specific, assessments, of, wind, resource, potential, can, be, obtained, from, specialist, commercial, providers, and, many, of, the, larger, wind, developers, have, in, house, modeling, capabilities, the, total, amount, of, economically, extractable, power, available, from, the, wind, is, considerably, more, than, present, human, power, use, from, all, sources, the, strength, of, wind, varies, and, an, average, value, for, a, given, location, does, not, alone, indicate, the, amount, of, energy, a, wind, turbine, could, produce, there, to, assess, prospective, wind, power, sites, a, probability, distribution, function, is, often, fit, to, the, observed, wind, speed, data, different, locations, will, have, different, wind, speed, distributions, the, weibull, model, closely, mirrors, the, actual, distribution, of, hourly, ten, minute, wind, speeds, at, many, locations, the, weibull, factor, is, often, close, to, 2, and, therefore, a, rayleigh, distribution, can, be, used, as, a, less, accurate, but, simpler, model, a, wind, farm, is, a, group, of, wind, turbines, in, the, same, location, a, large, wind, farm, may, consist, of, several, hundred, individual, wind, turbines, distributed, over, an, extended, area, the, land, between, the, turbines, may, be, used, for, agricultural, or, other, purposes, a, wind, farm, may, also, be, located, offshore, almost, all, large, wind, turbines, have, the, same, design, a, horizontal, axis, wind, turbine, having, an, upwind, rotor, with, 3, blades, attached, to, a, nacelle, on, top, of, a, tall, tubular, tower, in, a, wind, farm, individual, turbines, are, interconnected, with, a, medium, voltage, often, 34, 5, kv, power, collection, system, and, communications, network, in, general, a, distance, of, 7d, 7, times, the, rotor, diameter, of, the, wind, turbine, is, set, between, each, turbine, in, a, fully, developed, wind, farm, at, a, substation, this, medium, voltage, electric, current, is, increased, in, voltage, with, a, transformer, for, connection, to, the, high, voltage, electric, power, transmission, system, most, modern, turbines, use, variable, speed, generators, combined, with, either, a, partial, or, full, scale, power, converter, between, the, turbine, generator, and, the, collector, system, which, generally, have, more, desirable, properties, for, grid, interconnection, and, have, low, voltage, ride, through, capabilities, modern, turbines, use, either, doubly, fed, electric, machines, with, partial, scale, converters, or, squirrel, cage, induction, generators, or, synchronous, generators, both, permanently, and, electrically, excited, with, full, scale, converters, black, start, is, possible, and, is, being, further, developed, for, places, such, as, iowa, which, generate, most, of, their, electricity, from, wind, transmission, system, operators, will, supply, a, wind, farm, developer, with, a, grid, code, to, specify, the, requirements, for, interconnection, to, the, transmission, grid, this, will, include, the, power, factor, the, constancy, of, frequency, and, the, dynamic, behaviour, of, the, wind, farm, turbines, during, a, system, fault, offshore, wind, power, is, wind, farms, in, large, bodies, of, water, usually, the, sea, these, installations, can, use, the, more, frequent, and, powerful, winds, that, are, available, in, these, locations, and, have, less, visual, impact, on, the, landscape, than, land, based, projects, however, the, construction, and, maintenance, costs, are, considerably, higher, as, of, november, 2021, the, hornsea, wind, farm, in, the, united, kingdom, is, the, largest, offshore, wind, farm, in, the, world, at, 1, 218, mw, near, offshore, wind, farms, may, be, connected, by, ac, and, far, offshore, by, hvdc, wind, power, resources, are, not, always, located, near, to, high, population, density, as, transmission, lines, become, longer, the, losses, associated, with, power, transmission, increase, as, modes, of, losses, at, lower, lengths, are, exacerbated, and, new, modes, of, losses, are, no, longer, negligible, as, the, length, is, increased, making, it, harder, to, transport, large, loads, over, large, distances, when, the, transmission, capacity, does, not, meet, the, generation, capacity, wind, farms, are, forced, to, produce, below, their, full, potential, or, stop, running, altogether, in, a, process, known, as, curtailment, while, this, leads, to, potential, renewable, generation, left, untapped, it, prevents, possible, grid, overload, or, risk, to, reliable, service, one, of, the, biggest, current, challenges, to, wind, power, grid, integration, in, some, countries, is, the, necessity, of, developing, new, transmission, lines, to, carry, power, from, wind, farms, usually, in, remote, lowly, populated, areas, due, to, availability, of, wind, to, high, load, locations, usually, on, the, coasts, where, population, density, is, higher, any, existing, transmission, lines, in, remote, locations, may, not, have, been, designed, for, the, transport, of, large, amounts, of, energy, in, particular, geographic, regions, peak, wind, speeds, may, not, coincide, with, peak, demand, for, electrical, power, whether, offshore, or, onshore, a, possible, future, option, may, be, to, interconnect, widely, dispersed, geographic, areas, with, an, hvdc, super, grid, in, 2020, wind, supplied, almost, 1600, twh, of, electricity, which, was, over, 5, of, worldwide, electrical, generation, and, about, 2, of, energy, consumption, with, over, 100, gw, added, during, 2020, mostly, in, china, global, installed, wind, power, capacity, reached, more, than, 730, gw, but, to, help, meet, the, paris, agreement, s, goals, to, limit, climate, change, analysts, say, it, should, expand, much, faster, by, over, 1, of, electricity, generation, per, year, expansion, of, wind, power, is, being, hindered, by, fossil, fuel, subsidies, the, actual, amount, of, electric, power, that, wind, can, generate, is, calculated, by, multiplying, the, nameplate, capacity, by, the, capacity, factor, which, varies, according, to, equipment, and, location, estimates, of, the, capacity, factors, for, wind, installations, are, in, the, range, of, 35, to, 44, since, wind, speed, is, not, constant, a, wind, farm, s, annual, energy, production, is, never, as, much, as, the, sum, of, the, generator, nameplate, ratings, multiplied, by, the, total, hours, in, a, year, the, ratio, of, actual, productivity, in, a, year, to, this, theoretical, maximum, is, called, the, capacity, factor, online, data, is, available, for, some, locations, and, the, capacity, factor, can, be, calculated, from, the, yearly, output, wind, energy, penetration, is, the, fraction, of, energy, produced, by, wind, compared, with, the, total, generation, wind, power, s, share, of, worldwide, electricity, usage, in, 2021, was, almost, 7, up, from, 3, 5, in, 2015, there, is, no, generally, accepted, maximum, level, of, wind, penetration, the, limit, for, a, particular, grid, will, depend, on, the, existing, generating, plants, pricing, mechanisms, capacity, for, energy, storage, demand, management, and, other, factors, an, interconnected, electric, power, grid, will, already, include, reserve, generating, and, transmission, capacity, to, allow, for, equipment, failures, this, reserve, capacity, can, also, serve, to, compensate, for, the, varying, power, generation, produced, by, wind, stations, studies, have, indicated, that, 20, of, the, total, annual, electrical, energy, consumption, may, be, incorporated, with, minimal, difficulty, these, studies, have, been, for, locations, with, geographically, dispersed, wind, farms, some, degree, of, dispatchable, energy, or, hydropower, with, storage, capacity, demand, management, and, interconnected, to, a, large, grid, area, enabling, the, export, of, electric, power, when, needed, electrical, utilities, continue, to, study, the, effects, of, large, scale, penetration, of, wind, generation, on, system, stability, a, wind, energy, penetration, figure, can, be, specified, for, different, duration, of, time, but, is, often, quoted, annually, to, generate, almost, all, electricity, from, wind, annually, requires, substantial, interconnection, to, other, systems, for, example, some, wind, power, in, scotland, is, sent, to, the, rest, of, the, british, grid, on, a, monthly, weekly, daily, or, hourly, basis, or, less, wind, might, supply, as, much, as, or, more, than, 100, of, current, use, with, the, rest, stored, exported, or, curtailed, the, seasonal, industry, might, then, take, advantage, of, high, wind, and, low, usage, times, such, as, at, night, when, wind, output, can, exceed, normal, demand, such, industry, might, include, the, production, of, silicon, aluminum, steel, or, natural, gas, and, hydrogen, and, using, future, long, term, storage, to, facilitate, 100, energy, from, variable, renewable, energy, homes, and, businesses, can, also, be, programmed, to, vary, electricity, demand, for, example, by, remotely, turning, up, water, heater, thermostats, wind, power, is, variable, and, during, low, wind, periods, it, may, need, to, be, replaced, by, other, power, sources, transmission, networks, presently, cope, with, outages, of, other, generation, plants, and, daily, changes, in, electrical, demand, but, the, variability, of, intermittent, power, sources, such, as, wind, power, is, more, frequent, than, those, of, conventional, power, generation, plants, which, when, scheduled, to, be, operating, may, be, able, to, deliver, their, nameplate, capacity, around, 95, of, the, time, electric, power, generated, from, wind, power, can, be, highly, variable, at, several, different, timescales, hourly, daily, or, seasonally, annual, variation, also, exists, but, is, not, as, significant, because, instantaneous, electrical, generation, and, consumption, must, remain, in, balance, to, maintain, grid, stability, this, variability, can, present, substantial, challenges, to, incorporating, large, amounts, of, wind, power, into, a, grid, system, intermittency, and, the, non, dispatchable, nature, of, wind, energy, production, can, raise, costs, for, regulation, incremental, operating, reserve, and, at, high, penetration, levels, could, require, an, increase, in, the, already, existing, energy, demand, management, load, shedding, storage, solutions, or, system, interconnection, with, hvdc, cables, fluctuations, in, load, and, allowance, for, the, failure, of, large, fossil, fuel, generating, units, require, operating, reserve, capacity, which, can, be, increased, to, compensate, for, the, variability, of, wind, generation, utility, scale, batteries, are, often, used, to, balance, hourly, and, shorter, timescale, variation, but, car, batteries, may, gain, ground, from, the, mid, 2020s, wind, power, advocates, argue, that, periods, of, low, wind, can, be, dealt, with, by, simply, restarting, existing, power, stations, that, have, been, held, in, readiness, or, interlinking, with, hvdc, the, combination, of, diversifying, variable, renewables, by, type, and, location, forecasting, their, variation, and, integrating, them, with, dispatchable, renewables, flexible, fueled, generators, and, demand, response, can, create, a, power, system, that, has, the, potential, to, meet, power, supply, needs, reliably, integrating, ever, higher, levels, of, renewables, is, being, successfully, demonstrated, in, the, real, world, solar, power, tends, to, be, complementary, to, wind, on, daily, to, weekly, timescales, high, pressure, areas, tend, to, bring, clear, skies, and, low, surface, winds, whereas, low, pressure, areas, tend, to, be, windier, and, cloudier, on, seasonal, timescales, solar, energy, peaks, in, summer, whereas, in, many, areas, wind, energy, is, lower, in, summer, and, higher, in, winter, thus, the, seasonal, variation, of, wind, and, solar, power, tend, to, cancel, each, other, somewhat, wind, hybrid, power, systems, are, becoming, more, popular, for, any, particular, generator, there, is, an, 80, chance, that, wind, output, will, change, less, than, 10, in, an, hour, and, a, 40, chance, that, it, will, change, 10, or, more, in, 5, hours, in, summer, 2021, wind, power, in, the, united, kingdom, fell, due, to, the, lowest, winds, in, seventy, years, in, the, future, smoothing, peaks, by, producing, green, hydrogen, may, help, when, wind, has, a, larger, share, of, generation, while, the, output, from, a, single, turbine, can, vary, greatly, and, rapidly, as, local, wind, speeds, vary, as, more, turbines, are, connected, over, larger, and, larger, areas, the, average, power, output, becomes, less, variable, and, more, predictable, weather, forecasting, permits, the, electric, power, network, to, be, readied, for, the, predictable, variations, in, production, that, occur, it, is, thought, that, the, most, reliable, low, carbon, electricity, systems, will, include, a, large, share, of, wind, power, typically, conventional, hydroelectricity, complements, wind, power, very, well, when, the, wind, is, blowing, strongly, nearby, hydroelectric, stations, can, temporarily, hold, back, their, water, when, the, wind, drops, they, can, provided, they, have, the, generation, capacity, rapidly, increase, production, to, compensate, this, gives, a, very, even, overall, power, supply, and, virtually, no, loss, of, energy, and, uses, no, more, water, alternatively, where, a, suitable, head, of, water, is, not, available, pumped, storage, hydroelectricity, or, other, forms, of, grid, energy, storage, such, as, compressed, air, energy, storage, and, thermal, energy, storage, can, store, energy, developed, by, high, wind, periods, and, release, it, when, needed, the, type, of, storage, needed, depends, on, the, wind, penetration, level, low, penetration, requires, daily, storage, and, high, penetration, requires, both, short, and, long, term, storage, as, long, as, a, month, or, more, stored, energy, increases, the, economic, value, of, wind, energy, since, it, can, be, shifted, to, displace, higher, cost, generation, during, peak, demand, periods, the, potential, revenue, from, this, arbitrage, can, offset, the, cost, and, losses, of, storage, although, pumped, storage, power, systems, are, only, about, 75, efficient, and, have, high, installation, costs, their, low, running, costs, and, ability, to, reduce, the, required, electrical, base, load, can, save, both, fuel, and, total, electrical, generation, costs, the, energy, needed, to, build, a, wind, farm, divided, into, the, total, output, over, its, life, energy, return, on, energy, invested, of, wind, power, varies, but, averages, about, 20, 25, thus, the, energy, payback, time, is, typically, around, a, year, onshore, wind, is, an, inexpensive, source, of, electric, power, cheaper, than, coal, plants, and, new, gas, plants, according, to, businessgreen, wind, turbines, reached, grid, parity, the, point, at, which, the, cost, of, wind, power, matches, traditional, sources, in, some, areas, of, europe, in, the, mid, 2000s, and, in, the, us, around, the, same, time, falling, prices, continue, to, drive, the, levelized, cost, down, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, has, reached, general, grid, parity, in, europe, in, 2010, and, will, reach, the, same, point, in, the, us, around, 2016, due, to, an, expected, reduction, in, capital, costs, of, about, 12, in, 2021, the, ceo, of, siemens, gamesa, warned, that, increased, demand, for, low, cost, wind, turbines, combined, with, high, input, costs, and, high, costs, of, steel, result, in, increased, pressure, on, the, manufacturers, and, decreasing, profit, margins, northern, eurasia, canada, some, parts, of, the, united, states, and, patagonia, in, argentina, are, the, best, areas, for, onshore, wind, whereas, in, other, parts, of, the, world, solar, power, or, a, combination, of, wind, and, solar, tend, to, be, cheaper, 8, wind, power, is, capital, intensive, but, has, no, fuel, costs, the, price, of, wind, power, is, therefore, much, more, stable, than, the, volatile, prices, of, fossil, fuel, sources, however, the, estimated, average, cost, per, unit, of, electric, power, must, incorporate, the, cost, of, construction, of, the, turbine, and, transmission, facilities, borrowed, funds, return, to, investors, including, the, cost, of, risk, estimated, annual, production, and, other, components, averaged, over, the, projected, useful, life, of, the, equipment, which, may, be, more, than, 20, years, energy, cost, estimates, are, highly, dependent, on, these, assumptions, so, published, cost, figures, can, differ, substantially, the, presence, of, wind, energy, even, when, subsidized, can, reduce, costs, for, consumers, 5, billion, yr, in, germany, by, reducing, the, marginal, price, by, minimizing, the, use, of, expensive, peaking, power, plants, the, cost, has, decreased, as, wind, turbine, technology, has, improved, there, are, now, longer, and, lighter, wind, turbine, blades, improvements, in, turbine, performance, and, increased, power, generation, efficiency, also, wind, project, capital, expenditure, costs, and, maintenance, costs, have, continued, to, decline, in, 2021, a, lazard, study, of, unsubsidized, electricity, said, that, wind, power, levelized, cost, of, electricity, continues, to, fall, but, more, slowly, than, before, the, study, estimated, new, wind, generated, electricity, cost, from, 26, to, 50, mwh, compared, to, new, gas, power, from, 45, to, 74, mwh, the, median, cost, of, fully, deprecated, existing, coal, power, was, 42, mwh, nuclear, 29, mwh, and, gas, 24, mwh, the, study, estimated, offshore, wind, at, around, 83, mwh, compound, annual, growth, rate, was, 4, per, year, from, 2016, to, 2021, compared, to, 10, per, year, from, 2009, to, 2021, turbine, prices, have, fallen, significantly, in, recent, years, due, to, tougher, competitive, conditions, such, as, the, increased, use, of, energy, auctions, and, the, elimination, of, subsidies, in, many, markets, as, of, 2021, subsidies, are, still, often, given, to, offshore, wind, but, they, are, generally, no, longer, necessary, for, onshore, wind, in, countries, with, even, a, very, low, carbon, price, such, as, china, provided, there, are, no, competing, fossil, fuel, subsidies, secondary, market, forces, provide, incentives, for, businesses, to, use, wind, generated, power, even, if, there, is, a, premium, price, for, the, electricity, for, example, socially, responsible, manufacturers, pay, utility, companies, a, premium, that, goes, to, subsidize, and, build, new, wind, power, infrastructure, companies, use, wind, generated, power, and, in, return, they, can, claim, that, they, are, undertaking, strong, green, efforts, wind, projects, provide, local, taxes, or, payments, in, place, of, taxes, and, strengthen, the, economy, of, rural, communities, by, providing, income, to, farmers, with, wind, turbines, on, their, land, the, wind, energy, sector, can, also, produce, jobs, during, the, construction, and, operating, phase, jobs, include, the, manufacturing, of, wind, turbines, and, the, construction, process, which, includes, transporting, installing, and, then, maintaining, the, turbines, an, estimated, 1, 25, million, people, were, employed, in, wind, power, in, 2020, small, scale, wind, power, is, the, name, given, to, wind, generation, systems, with, the, capacity, to, produce, up, to, 50, kw, of, electrical, power, isolated, communities, that, may, otherwise, rely, on, diesel, generators, may, use, wind, turbines, as, an, alternative, individuals, may, purchase, these, systems, to, reduce, or, eliminate, their, dependence, on, grid, electric, power, for, economic, reasons, or, to, reduce, their, carbon, footprint, wind, turbines, have, been, used, for, household, electric, power, generation, in, conjunction, with, battery, storage, over, many, decades, in, remote, areas, examples, of, small, scale, wind, power, projects, in, an, urban, setting, can, be, found, in, new, york, city, where, since, 2009, several, building, projects, have, capped, their, roofs, with, gorlov, type, helical, wind, turbines, although, the, energy, they, generate, is, small, compared, to, the, buildings, overall, consumption, they, help, to, reinforce, the, building, s, green, credentials, in, ways, that, showing, people, your, high, tech, boiler, cannot, with, some, of, the, projects, also, receiving, the, direct, support, of, the, new, york, state, energy, research, and, development, authority, grid, connected, domestic, wind, turbines, may, use, grid, energy, storage, thus, replacing, purchased, electric, power, with, locally, produced, power, when, available, the, surplus, power, produced, by, domestic, microgenerators, can, in, some, jurisdictions, be, fed, into, the, network, and, sold, to, the, utility, company, producing, a, retail, credit, for, the, microgenerators, owners, to, offset, their, energy, costs, off, grid, system, users, can, either, adapt, to, intermittent, power, or, use, batteries, photovoltaic, or, diesel, systems, to, supplement, the, wind, turbine, equipment, such, as, parking, meters, traffic, warning, signs, street, lighting, or, wireless, internet, gateways, may, be, powered, by, a, small, wind, turbine, possibly, combined, with, a, photovoltaic, system, that, charges, a, small, battery, replacing, the, need, for, a, connection, to, the, power, grid, airborne, wind, turbines, such, as, kites, can, be, used, in, places, at, risk, of, hurricanes, as, they, can, be, taken, down, in, advance, the, environmental, impact, of, electricity, generation, from, wind, power, is, minor, when, compared, to, that, of, fossil, fuel, power, wind, turbines, have, some, of, the, lowest, life, cycle, greenhouse, gas, emissions, of, energy, sources, far, less, greenhouse, gas, is, emitted, than, for, the, average, unit, of, electricity, so, wind, power, helps, limit, climate, change, use, of, engineered, wood, may, allow, carbon, negative, wind, power, wind, power, consumes, no, fuel, and, emits, no, local, air, pollution, unlike, fossil, fuel, power, sources, onshore, wind, farms, can, have, a, significant, visual, impact, due, to, a, very, low, surface, power, density, and, spacing, requirements, wind, farms, typically, need, to, be, spread, over, more, land, than, other, power, stations, their, network, of, turbines, access, roads, transmission, lines, and, substations, can, result, in, energy, sprawl, although, land, between, the, turbines, and, roads, can, still, be, used, for, agriculture, some, wind, farms, are, opposed, for, potentially, spoiling, protected, scenic, areas, archaeological, landscapes, and, heritage, sites, a, report, by, the, mountaineering, council, of, scotland, concluded, that, wind, farms, harmed, tourism, in, areas, known, for, natural, landscapes, and, panoramic, views, habitat, loss, and, fragmentation, are, the, greatest, potential, impacts, on, wildlife, of, onshore, wind, farms, but, the, worldwide, ecological, impact, is, minimal, thousands, of, birds, and, bats, including, rare, species, have, been, killed, by, wind, turbine, blades, though, wind, turbines, are, responsible, for, far, fewer, bird, deaths, than, fossil, fueled, power, stations, when, climate, change, effects, are, included, not, including, these, effects, modern, wind, turbines, kill, about, 0, 273, birds, per, gwh, in, comparison, with, 0, 200, by, coal, power, plants, the, effects, of, wind, turbines, on, birds, can, be, mitigated, with, proper, wildlife, monitoring, many, wind, turbine, blades, are, made, of, fiberglass, and, have, a, lifetime, of, 20, years, blades, are, hollow, some, blades, are, crushed, to, reduce, their, volume, and, then, landfilled, however, as, they, can, take, a, lot, of, weight, they, can, be, made, into, long, lasting, small, bridges, for, walkers, or, cyclists, blade, end, of, life, is, complicated, and, blades, manufactured, in, the, 2020s, are, more, likely, to, be, designed, to, be, completely, recyclable, wind, turbines, also, generate, noise, at, a, distance, of, 300, metres, 980, ft, this, may, be, around, 45, db, which, is, slightly, louder, than, a, refrigerator, at, 1, 5, km, 1, mi, they, become, inaudible, there, are, anecdotal, reports, of, negative, health, effects, on, people, who, live, very, close, to, wind, turbines, peer, reviewed, research, has, generally, not, supported, these, claims, although, wind, turbines, with, fixed, bases, are, a, mature, technology, and, new, installations, are, generally, no, longer, subsidized, floating, wind, turbines, are, a, relatively, new, technology, so, some, governments, subsidize, them, for, example, to, use, deeper, waters, fossil, fuel, subsidies, by, some, governments, are, slowing, the, growth, of, renewables, permitting, of, wind, farms, can, take, years, and, some, governments, are, trying, to, speed, up, the, wind, industry, says, this, will, help, limit, climate, change, and, increase, energy, security, sometimes, groups, such, as, fishers, resist, this, but, governments, say, that, rules, protecting, biodiversity, will, still, be, followed, surveys, of, public, attitudes, across, europe, and, in, many, other, countries, show, strong, public, support, for, wind, power, bakker, et, al, 2012, found, in, their, study, that, residents, who, did, not, want, turbines, built, near, them, suffered, significantly, more, stress, than, those, who, benefited, economically, from, wind, turbines, although, wind, power, is, a, popular, form, of, energy, generation, onshore, or, near, offshore, wind, farms, are, sometimes, opposed, for, their, impact, on, the, landscape, especially, scenic, areas, heritage, areas, and, archaeological, landscapes, as, well, as, noise, and, impact, on, tourism, in, other, cases, there, is, direct, community, ownership, of, wind, farms, the, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, who, have, become, involved, in, germany, s, small, and, medium, sized, wind, farms, demonstrate, such, support, there, a, 2010, harris, poll, found, strong, support, for, wind, power, in, germany, other, european, countries, and, the, united, states, public, support, in, the, united, states, has, decreased, from, 75, in, 2020, to, 62, in, 2021, with, the, democratic, party, supporting, the, use, of, wind, energy, twice, as, much, as, the, republican, party, president, biden, has, signed, an, executive, order, to, begin, building, large, scale, wind, farms, in, china, shen, et, al, 2019, found, that, chinese, city, dwellers, may, be, resistant, to, building, wind, turbines, in, urban, areas, with, a, surprisingly, high, proportion, of, people, citing, an, unfounded, fear, of, radiation, as, driving, their, concerns, also, the, study, finds, that, like, their, counterparts, in, oecd, countries, urban, chinese, respondents, are, sensitive, to, direct, costs, and, wildlife, externalities, distributing, relevant, information, about, turbines, to, the, public, may, alleviate, resistance, many, wind, power, companies, work, with, local, communities, to, reduce, environmental, and, other, concerns, associated, with, particular, wind, farms, in, other, cases, there, is, direct, community, ownership, of, wind, farm, projects, appropriate, government, consultation, planning, and, approval, procedures, also, help, to, minimize, environmental, risks, some, may, still, object, to, wind, farms, but, many, say, their, concerns, should, be, weighed, against, the, need, to, address, the, threats, posed, by, air, pollution, climate, change, and, the, opinions, of, the, broader, community, in, the, us, wind, power, projects, are, reported, to, boost, local, tax, bases, helping, to, pay, for, schools, roads, and, hospitals, and, to, revitalize, the, economies, of, rural, communities, by, providing, steady, income, to, farmers, and, other, landowners, in, the, uk, both, the, national, trust, and, the, campaign, to, protect, rural, england, have, expressed, concerns, about, the, effects, on, the, rural, landscape, caused, by, inappropriately, sited, wind, turbines, and, wind, farms, some, wind, farms, have, become, tourist, attractions, the, whitelee, wind, farm, visitor, centre, has, an, exhibition, room, a, learning, hub, a, caf, with, a, viewing, deck, and, also, a, shop, it, is, run, by, the, glasgow, science, centre, in, denmark, a, loss, of, value, scheme, gives, people, the, right, to, claim, compensation, for, loss, of, value, of, their, property, if, it, is, caused, by, proximity, to, a, wind, turbine, the, loss, must, be, at, least, 1, of, the, property, s, value, despite, this, general, support, for, the, concept, of, wind, power, in, the, public, at, large, local, opposition, often, exists, and, has, delayed, or, aborted, a, number, of, projects, as, well, as, concerns, about, the, landscape, there, are, concerns, that, some, installations, can, produce, excessive, sound, and, vibration, levels, leading, to, a, decrease, in, property, values, a, study, of, 50, 000, home, sales, near, wind, turbines, found, no, statistical, evidence, that, prices, were, affected, while, aesthetic, issues, are, subjective, and, some, find, wind, farms, pleasant, and, optimistic, or, symbols, of, energy, independence, and, local, prosperity, protest, groups, are, often, formed, to, attempt, to, block, some, wind, power, stations, for, various, reasons, some, opposition, to, wind, farms, is, dismissed, as, nimbyism, but, research, carried, out, in, 2009, found, that, there, is, little, evidence, to, support, the, belief, that, residents, only, object, to, wind, farms, because, of, a, not, in, my, back, yard, attitude, wind, cannot, be, cut, off, unlike, oil, and, gas, so, can, contribute, to, energy, security, wind, turbines, are, devices, that, convert, the, wind, s, kinetic, energy, into, electrical, power, the, result, of, over, a, millennium, of, windmill, development, and, modern, engineering, today, s, wind, turbines, are, manufactured, in, a, wide, range, of, horizontal, axis, and, vertical, axis, types, the, smallest, turbines, are, used, for, applications, such, as, battery, charging, for, auxiliary, power, slightly, larger, turbines, can, be, used, for, making, small, contributions, to, a, domestic, power, supply, while, selling, unused, power, back, to, the, utility, supplier, via, the, electrical, grid, arrays, of, large, turbines, known, as, wind, farms, have, become, an, increasingly, important, source, of, renewable, energy, and, are, used, in, many, countries, as, part, of, a, strategy, to, reduce, their, reliance, on, fossil, fuels, wind, turbine, design, is, the, process, of, defining, the, form, and, specifications, of, a, wind, turbine, to, extract, energy, from, the, wind, a, wind, turbine, installation, consists, of, the, necessary, systems, needed, to, capture, the, wind, s, energy, point, the, turbine, into, the, wind, convert, mechanical, rotation, into, electrical, power, and, other, systems, to, start, stop, and, control, the, turbine, in, 1919, the, german, physicist, albert, betz, showed, that, for, a, hypothetical, ideal, wind, energy, extraction, machine, the, fundamental, laws, of, conservation, of, mass, and, energy, allowed, no, more, than, 16, 27, 59, of, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, wind, to, be, captured, this, betz, limit, can, be, approached, in, modern, turbine, designs, which, may, reach, 70, to, 80, of, the, theoretical, betz, limit, the, aerodynamics, of, a, wind, turbine, are, not, straightforward, the, airflow, at, the, blades, is, not, the, same, as, the, airflow, far, away, from, the, turbine, the, very, nature, of, how, energy, is, extracted, from, the, air, also, causes, air, to, be, deflected, by, the, turbine, this, affects, the, objects, or, other, turbines, downstream, which, is, known, as, wake, effect, also, the, aerodynamics, of, a, wind, turbine, at, the, rotor, surface, exhibit, phenomena, that, are, rarely, seen, in, other, aerodynamic, fields, the, shape, and, dimensions, of, the, blades, of, the, wind, turbine, are, determined, by, the, aerodynamic, performance, required, to, efficiently, extract, energy, from, the, wind, and, by, the, strength, required, to, resist, the, forces, on, the, blade, in, addition, to, the, aerodynamic, design, of, the, blades, the, design, of, a, complete, wind, power, system, must, also, address, the, design, of, the, installation, s, rotor, hub, nacelle, tower, structure, generator, controls, and, foundation, wind, power, has, been, used, as, long, as, humans, have, put, sails, into, the, wind, wind, powered, machines, used, to, grind, grain, and, pump, water, the, windmill, and, wind, pump, were, developed, in, what, is, now, iran, afghanistan, and, pakistan, by, the, 9th, century, wind, power, was, widely, available, and, not, confined, to, the, banks, of, fast, flowing, streams, or, later, requiring, sources, of, fuel, wind, powered, pumps, drained, the, polders, of, the, netherlands, and, in, arid, regions, such, as, the, american, mid, west, or, the, australian, outback, wind, pumps, provided, water, for, livestock, and, steam, engines, the, first, windmill, used, for, the, production, of, electric, power, was, built, in, scotland, in, july, 1887, by, prof, james, blyth, of, anderson, s, college, glasgow, the, precursor, of, strathclyde, university, blyth, s, 10, metres, 33, ft, high, cloth, sailed, wind, turbine, was, installed, in, the, garden, of, his, holiday, cottage, at, marykirk, in, kincardineshire, and, was, used, to, charge, accumulators, developed, by, the, frenchman, camille, alphonse, faure, to, power, the, lighting, in, the, cottage, thus, making, it, the, first, house, in, the, world, to, have, its, electric, power, supplied, by, wind, power, blyth, offered, the, surplus, electric, power, to, the, people, of, marykirk, for, lighting, the, main, street, however, they, turned, down, the, offer, as, they, thought, electric, power, was, the, work, of, the, devil, although, he, later, built, a, wind, turbine, to, supply, emergency, power, to, the, local, lunatic, asylum, infirmary, and, dispensary, of, montrose, the, invention, never, really, caught, on, as, the, technology, was, not, considered, to, be, economically, viable, across, the, atlantic, in, cleveland, ohio, a, larger, and, heavily, engineered, machine, was, designed, and, constructed, in, the, winter, of, 1887, 1888, by, charles, f, brush, this, was, built, by, his, engineering, company, at, his, home, and, operated, from, 1886, until, 1900, the, brush, wind, turbine, had, a, rotor, 17, metres, 56, ft, in, diameter, and, was, mounted, on, an, 18, metres, 59, ft, tower, although, large, by, today, s, standards, the, machine, was, only, rated, at, 12, kw, the, connected, dynamo, was, used, either, to, charge, a, bank, of, batteries, or, to, operate, up, to, 100, incandescent, light, bulbs, three, arc, lamps, and, various, motors, in, brush, s, laboratory, with, the, development, of, electric, power, wind, power, found, new, applications, in, lighting, buildings, remote, from, centrally, generated, power, throughout, the, 20th, century, parallel, paths, developed, small, wind, stations, suitable, for, farms, or, residences, from, 1932, many, isolated, properties, in, australia, ran, their, lighting, and, electric, fans, from, batteries, charged, by, a, freelite, wind, driven, generator, producing, 100, watts, of, electrical, power, from, as, little, wind, speed, as, 10, miles, per, hour, 16, km, h, the, 1973, oil, crisis, triggered, the, investigation, in, denmark, and, the, united, states, that, led, to, larger, utility, scale, wind, generators, that, could, be, connected, to, electric, power, grids, for, remote, use, of, power, by, 2008, the, u, s, installed, capacity, had, reached, 25, 4, gigawatts, and, by, 2012, the, installed, capacity, was, 60, gigawatts, today, wind, powered, generators, operate, in, every, size, range, between, tiny, stations, for, battery, charging, at, isolated, residences, up, to, gigawatt, sized, offshore, wind, farms, that, provide, electric, power, to, national, electrical, networks, the, european, union, is, working, to, augment, these, prospects, in, 2023, the, global, wind, power, sector, experienced, significant, growth, with, 116, 6, gigawatts, gw, of, new, capacity, added, to, the, power, grid, representing, a, 50, increase, over, the, amount, added, in, 2022, this, surge, in, capacity, brought, the, total, installed, wind, power, capacity, worldwide, to, 1, 021, gw, by, the, end, of, the, year, marking, a, growth, of, 13, compared, to, the, previous, year, 138
