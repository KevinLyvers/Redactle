a, flat, panel, display, fpd, is, an, electronic, display, used, to, display, visual, content, such, as, text, or, images, it, is, present, in, consumer, medical, transportation, and, industrial, equipment, flat, panel, displays, are, thin, lightweight, provide, better, linearity, and, are, capable, of, higher, resolution, than, typical, consumer, grade, tvs, from, earlier, eras, they, are, usually, less, than, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, thick, while, the, highest, resolution, for, consumer, grade, crt, televisions, was, 1080i, many, flat, panel, displays, in, the, 2020s, are, capable, of, 1080p, and, 4k, resolution, in, the, 2010s, portable, consumer, electronics, such, as, laptops, mobile, phones, and, portable, cameras, have, used, flat, panel, displays, since, they, consume, less, power, and, are, lightweight, as, of, 2016, flat, panel, displays, have, almost, completely, replaced, crt, displays, most, 2010s, era, flat, panel, displays, use, lcd, or, light, emitting, diode, led, technologies, sometimes, combined, most, lcd, screens, are, back, lit, with, color, filters, used, to, display, colors, in, many, cases, flat, panel, displays, are, combined, with, touch, screen, technology, which, allows, the, user, to, interact, with, the, display, in, a, natural, manner, for, example, modern, smartphone, displays, often, use, oled, panels, with, capacitive, touch, screens, flat, panel, displays, can, be, divided, into, two, display, device, categories, volatile, and, static, the, former, requires, that, pixels, be, periodically, electronically, refreshed, to, retain, their, state, e, g, liquid, crystal, displays, lcd, and, can, only, show, an, image, when, it, has, power, on, the, other, hand, static, flat, panel, displays, rely, on, materials, whose, color, states, are, bistable, such, as, displays, that, make, use, of, e, ink, technology, and, as, such, retain, content, even, when, power, is, removed, the, first, engineering, proposal, for, a, flat, panel, tv, was, by, general, electric, in, 1954, as, a, result, of, its, work, on, radar, monitors, the, publication, of, their, findings, gave, all, the, basics, of, future, flat, panel, tvs, and, monitors, but, ge, did, not, continue, with, the, r, d, required, and, never, built, a, working, flat, panel, at, that, time, the, first, production, flat, panel, display, was, the, aiken, tube, developed, in, the, early, 1950s, and, produced, in, limited, numbers, in, 1958, this, saw, some, use, in, military, systems, as, a, heads, up, display, and, as, an, oscilloscope, monitor, but, conventional, technologies, overtook, its, development, attempts, to, commercialize, the, system, for, home, television, use, ran, into, continued, problems, and, the, system, was, never, released, commercially, dennis, gabor, better, known, as, the, inventor, of, holography, patented, a, flat, screen, crt, in, 1958, this, was, substantially, similar, to, aiken, s, concept, and, led, to, a, years, long, patent, battle, by, the, time, the, lawsuits, were, complete, with, aiken, s, patent, applying, in, the, us, and, gabor, s, in, the, uk, the, commercial, aspects, had, long, lapsed, and, the, two, became, friends, around, this, time, clive, sinclair, came, across, gabor, s, work, and, began, an, ultimately, unsuccessful, decade, long, effort, to, commercialize, it, the, philco, predicta, featured, a, relatively, flat, for, its, day, cathode, ray, tube, setup, and, would, be, the, first, commercially, released, flat, panel, upon, its, launch, in, 1958, the, predicta, was, a, commercial, failure, the, plasma, display, panel, was, invented, in, 1964, at, the, university, of, illinois, according, to, the, history, of, plasma, display, panels, the, mosfet, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, or, mos, transistor, was, invented, by, mohamed, m, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, at, bell, labs, in, 1959, and, presented, in, 1960, building, on, their, work, paul, k, weimer, at, rca, developed, the, thin, film, transistor, tft, in, 1962, it, was, a, type, of, mosfet, distinct, from, the, standard, bulk, mosfet, the, idea, of, a, tft, based, lcd, was, conceived, by, bernard, j, lechner, of, rca, laboratories, in, 1968, b, j, lechner, f, j, marlowe, e, o, nester, and, j, tults, demonstrated, the, concept, in, 1968, with, a, dynamic, scattering, lcd, that, used, standard, discrete, mosfets, the, first, active, matrix, addressed, electroluminescent, display, eld, was, made, using, tfts, by, t, peter, brody, s, thin, film, devices, department, at, westinghouse, electric, corporation, in, 1968, in, 1973, brody, j, a, asars, and, g, d, dixon, at, westinghouse, research, laboratories, demonstrated, the, first, thin, film, transistor, liquid, crystal, display, tft, lcd, brody, and, fang, chen, luo, demonstrated, the, first, flat, active, matrix, liquid, crystal, display, am, lcd, using, tfts, in, 1974, by, 1982, pocket, lcd, tvs, based, on, lcd, technology, were, developed, in, japan, the, 2, 1, inch, epson, et, 10, epson, elf, was, the, first, color, lcd, pocket, tv, released, in, 1984, in, 1988, a, sharp, research, team, led, by, engineer, t, nagayasu, demonstrated, a, 14, inch, full, color, lcd, which, convinced, the, electronics, industry, that, lcd, would, eventually, replace, crts, as, the, standard, television, display, technology, as, of, 2013, all, modern, high, resolution, and, high, quality, electronic, visual, display, devices, use, tft, based, active, matrix, displays, the, first, usable, led, display, was, developed, by, hewlett, packard, hp, and, introduced, in, 1968, it, was, the, result, of, research, and, development, r, d, on, practical, led, technology, between, 1962, and, 1968, by, a, research, team, under, howard, c, borden, gerald, p, pighini, and, mohamed, m, atalla, at, hp, associates, and, hp, labs, in, february, 1969, they, introduced, the, hp, model, 5082, 7000, numeric, indicator, it, was, the, first, alphanumeric, led, display, and, was, a, revolution, in, digital, display, technology, replacing, the, nixie, tube, for, numeric, displays, and, becoming, the, basis, for, later, led, displays, in, 1977, james, p, mitchell, prototyped, and, later, demonstrated, what, was, perhaps, the, earliest, monochromatic, flat, panel, led, television, display, ching, w, tang, and, steven, van, slyke, at, eastman, kodak, built, the, first, practical, organic, led, oled, device, in, 1987, in, 2003, hynix, produced, an, organic, el, driver, capable, of, lighting, in, 4, 096, colors, in, 2004, the, sony, qualia, 005, was, the, first, led, backlit, lcd, the, sony, xel, 1, released, in, 2007, was, the, first, oled, television, field, effect, lcds, are, lightweight, compact, portable, cheap, more, reliable, and, easier, on, the, eyes, than, crt, screens, lcd, screens, use, a, thin, layer, of, liquid, crystal, a, liquid, that, exhibits, crystalline, properties, it, is, sandwiched, between, two, glass, plates, carrying, transparent, electrodes, two, polarizing, films, are, placed, at, each, side, of, the, lcd, by, generating, a, controlled, electric, field, between, electrodes, various, segments, or, pixels, of, the, liquid, crystal, can, be, activated, causing, changes, in, their, polarizing, properties, these, polarizing, properties, depend, on, the, alignment, of, the, liquid, crystal, layer, and, the, specific, field, effect, used, being, either, twisted, nematic, tn, in, plane, switching, ips, or, vertical, alignment, va, color, is, produced, by, applying, appropriate, color, filters, red, green, and, blue, to, the, individual, subpixels, lc, displays, are, used, in, various, electronics, like, watches, calculators, mobile, phones, tvs, computer, monitors, and, laptops, screens, etc, most, earlier, large, lcd, screens, were, back, lit, using, a, number, of, ccfl, cold, cathode, fluorescent, lamps, however, small, pocket, size, devices, almost, always, used, leds, as, their, illumination, source, with, the, improvement, of, leds, almost, all, new, displays, are, now, equipped, with, led, backlight, technology, the, image, is, still, generated, by, the, lcd, layer, a, plasma, display, consists, of, two, glass, plates, separated, by, a, thin, gap, filled, with, a, gas, such, as, neon, each, of, these, plates, has, several, parallel, electrodes, running, across, it, the, electrodes, on, the, two, plates, are, at, right, angles, to, each, other, a, voltage, applied, between, the, two, electrodes, one, on, each, plate, causes, a, small, segment, of, gas, at, the, two, electrodes, to, glow, the, glow, of, gas, segments, is, maintained, by, a, lower, voltage, that, is, continuously, applied, to, all, electrodes, by, 2010, consumer, plasma, displays, had, been, discontinued, by, numerous, manufacturers, in, an, electroluminescent, display, eld, the, image, is, created, by, applying, electrical, signals, to, the, plates, which, make, the, phosphor, glow, an, oled, organic, light, emitting, diode, is, a, light, emitting, diode, led, in, which, the, emissive, electroluminescent, layer, is, a, film, of, organic, compound, which, emits, light, in, response, to, an, electric, current, this, layer, of, organic, semiconductor, is, situated, between, two, electrodes, typically, at, least, one, of, these, electrodes, is, transparent, oleds, are, used, to, create, digital, displays, in, devices, such, as, television, screens, computer, monitors, portable, systems, such, as, mobile, phones, handheld, game, consoles, and, pdas, qled, or, quantum, dot, led, is, a, flat, panel, display, technology, introduced, by, samsung, under, this, trademark, other, television, set, manufacturers, such, as, sony, have, used, the, same, technology, to, enhance, the, backlighting, of, lcd, tvs, already, in, 2013, quantum, dots, create, their, own, unique, light, when, illuminated, by, a, light, source, of, shorter, wavelength, such, as, blue, leds, this, type, of, led, tv, enhances, the, colour, gamut, of, lcd, panels, where, the, image, is, still, generated, by, the, lcd, in, the, view, of, samsung, quantum, dot, displays, for, large, screen, tvs, are, expected, to, become, more, popular, than, the, oled, displays, in, the, coming, years, firms, like, nanoco, and, nanosys, compete, to, provide, the, qd, materials, in, the, meantime, samsung, galaxy, devices, such, as, smartphones, are, still, equipped, with, oled, displays, manufactured, by, samsung, as, well, samsung, explains, on, their, website, that, the, qled, tv, they, produce, can, determine, what, part, of, the, display, needs, more, or, less, contrast, samsung, also, announced, a, partnership, with, microsoft, that, will, promote, the, new, samsung, qled, tv, volatile, displays, require, that, pixels, be, periodically, refreshed, to, retain, their, state, even, for, a, static, image, as, such, a, volatile, screen, needs, electrical, power, either, from, mains, electricity, being, plugged, into, a, wall, socket, or, a, battery, to, maintain, an, image, on, the, display, or, change, the, image, this, refresh, typically, occurs, many, times, a, second, if, this, is, not, done, for, example, if, there, is, a, power, outage, the, pixels, will, gradually, lose, their, coherent, state, and, the, image, will, fade, from, the, screen, the, following, flat, display, technologies, have, been, commercialized, in, 1990s, to, 2010s, technologies, that, were, extensively, researched, but, their, commercialization, was, limited, or, has, been, ultimately, abandoned, static, flat, panel, displays, rely, on, materials, whose, color, states, are, bistable, this, means, that, the, image, they, hold, requires, no, energy, to, maintain, but, instead, requires, energy, to, change, this, results, in, a, much, more, energy, efficient, display, but, with, a, tendency, toward, slow, refresh, rates, which, are, undesirable, in, an, interactive, display, bistable, flat, panel, displays, are, beginning, deployment, in, limited, applications, cholesteric, liquid, crystal, displays, manufactured, by, magink, in, outdoor, advertising, electrophoretic, displays, in, e, book, reader, devices, from, sony, and, irex, anlabels, interferometric, modulator, displays, in, a, smartwatch
