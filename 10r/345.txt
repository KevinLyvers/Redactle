robotics, is, the, interdisciplinary, study, and, practice, of, the, design, construction, operation, and, use, of, robots, within, mechanical, engineering, robotics, is, the, design, and, construction, of, the, physical, structures, of, robots, while, in, computer, science, robotics, focuses, on, robotic, automation, algorithms, other, disciplines, contributing, to, robotics, include, electrical, control, software, information, electronic, telecommunication, computer, mechatronic, and, materials, engineering, the, goal, of, most, robotics, is, to, design, machines, that, can, help, and, assist, humans, many, robots, are, built, to, do, jobs, that, are, hazardous, to, people, such, as, finding, survivors, in, unstable, ruins, and, exploring, space, mines, and, shipwrecks, others, replace, people, in, jobs, that, are, boring, repetitive, or, unpleasant, such, as, cleaning, monitoring, transporting, and, assembling, today, robotics, is, a, rapidly, growing, field, as, technological, advances, continue, researching, designing, and, building, new, robots, serve, various, practical, purposes, robotics, usually, combines, three, aspects, of, design, work, to, create, robot, systems, as, more, and, more, robots, are, designed, for, specific, tasks, this, method, of, classification, becomes, more, relevant, for, example, many, robots, are, designed, for, assembly, work, which, may, not, be, readily, adaptable, for, other, applications, they, are, termed, assembly, robots, for, seam, welding, some, suppliers, provide, complete, welding, systems, with, the, robot, i, e, the, welding, equipment, along, with, other, material, handling, facilities, like, turntables, etc, as, an, integrated, unit, such, an, integrated, robotic, system, is, called, a, welding, robot, even, though, its, discrete, manipulator, unit, could, be, adapted, to, a, variety, of, tasks, some, robots, are, specifically, designed, for, heavy, load, manipulation, and, are, labeled, as, heavy, duty, robots, current, and, potential, applications, include, at, present, mostly, lead, acid, batteries, are, used, as, a, power, source, many, different, types, of, batteries, can, be, used, as, a, power, source, for, robots, they, range, from, lead, acid, batteries, which, are, safe, and, have, relatively, long, shelf, lives, but, are, rather, heavy, compared, to, silver, cadmium, batteries, which, are, much, smaller, in, volume, and, are, currently, much, more, expensive, designing, a, battery, powered, robot, needs, to, take, into, account, factors, such, as, safety, cycle, lifetime, and, weight, generators, often, some, type, of, internal, combustion, engine, can, also, be, used, however, such, designs, are, often, mechanically, complex, and, need, fuel, require, heat, dissipation, and, are, relatively, heavy, a, tether, connecting, the, robot, to, a, power, supply, would, remove, the, power, supply, from, the, robot, entirely, this, has, the, advantage, of, saving, weight, and, space, by, moving, all, power, generation, and, storage, components, elsewhere, however, this, design, does, come, with, the, drawback, of, constantly, having, a, cable, connected, to, the, robot, which, can, be, difficult, to, manage, potential, power, sources, could, be, actuators, are, the, muscles, of, a, robot, the, parts, which, convert, stored, energy, into, movement, by, far, the, most, popular, actuators, are, electric, motors, that, rotate, a, wheel, or, gear, and, linear, actuators, that, control, industrial, robots, in, factories, there, are, some, recent, advances, in, alternative, types, of, actuators, powered, by, electricity, chemicals, or, compressed, air, the, vast, majority, of, robots, use, electric, motors, often, brushed, and, brushless, dc, motors, in, portable, robots, or, ac, motors, in, industrial, robots, and, cnc, machines, these, motors, are, often, preferred, in, systems, with, lighter, loads, and, where, the, predominant, form, of, motion, is, rotational, various, types, of, linear, actuators, move, in, and, out, instead, of, by, spinning, and, often, have, quicker, direction, changes, particularly, when, very, large, forces, are, needed, such, as, with, industrial, robotics, they, are, typically, powered, by, compressed, and, oxidized, air, pneumatic, actuator, or, an, oil, hydraulic, actuator, linear, actuators, can, also, be, powered, by, electricity, which, usually, consists, of, a, motor, and, a, leadscrew, another, common, type, is, a, mechanical, linear, actuator, such, as, a, rack, and, pinion, on, a, car, series, elastic, actuation, sea, relies, on, the, idea, of, introducing, intentional, elasticity, between, the, motor, actuator, and, the, load, for, robust, force, control, due, to, the, resultant, lower, reflected, inertia, series, elastic, actuation, improves, safety, when, a, robot, interacts, with, the, environment, e, g, humans, or, workpieces, or, during, collisions, furthermore, it, also, provides, energy, efficiency, and, shock, absorption, mechanical, filtering, while, reducing, excessive, wear, on, the, transmission, and, other, mechanical, components, this, approach, has, successfully, been, employed, in, various, robots, particularly, advanced, manufacturing, robots, and, walking, humanoid, robots, the, controller, design, of, a, series, elastic, actuator, is, most, often, performed, within, the, passivity, framework, as, it, ensures, the, safety, of, interaction, with, unstructured, environments, despite, its, remarkable, stability, and, robustness, this, framework, suffers, from, the, stringent, limitations, imposed, on, the, controller, which, may, trade, off, performance, the, reader, is, referred, to, the, following, survey, which, summarizes, the, common, controller, architectures, for, sea, along, with, the, corresponding, sufficient, passivity, conditions, one, recent, study, has, derived, the, necessary, and, sufficient, passivity, conditions, for, one, of, the, most, common, impedance, control, architectures, namely, velocity, sourced, sea, this, work, is, of, particular, importance, as, it, drives, the, non, conservative, passivity, bounds, in, an, sea, scheme, for, the, first, time, which, allows, a, larger, selection, of, control, gains, pneumatic, artificial, muscles, also, known, as, air, muscles, are, special, tubes, that, expand, typically, up, to, 42, when, air, is, forced, inside, them, they, are, used, in, some, robot, applications, muscle, wire, also, known, as, shape, memory, alloy, nitinol, or, flexinol, wire, is, a, material, that, contracts, under, 5, when, electricity, is, applied, they, have, been, used, for, some, small, robot, applications, eaps, or, epams, are, a, plastic, material, that, can, contract, substantially, up, to, 380, activation, strain, from, electricity, and, have, been, used, in, facial, muscles, and, arms, of, humanoid, robots, and, to, enable, new, robots, to, float, fly, swim, or, walk, recent, alternatives, to, dc, motors, are, piezo, motors, or, ultrasonic, motors, these, work, on, a, fundamentally, different, principle, whereby, tiny, piezoceramic, elements, vibrating, many, thousands, of, times, per, second, cause, linear, or, rotary, motion, there, are, different, mechanisms, of, operation, one, type, uses, the, vibration, of, the, piezo, elements, to, step, the, motor, in, a, circle, or, a, straight, line, another, type, uses, the, piezo, elements, to, cause, a, nut, to, vibrate, or, to, drive, a, screw, the, advantages, of, these, motors, are, nanometer, resolution, speed, and, available, force, for, their, size, these, motors, are, already, available, commercially, and, being, used, on, some, robots, elastic, nanotubes, are, a, promising, artificial, muscle, technology, in, early, stage, experimental, development, the, absence, of, defects, in, carbon, nanotubes, enables, these, filaments, to, deform, elastically, by, several, percent, with, energy, storage, levels, of, perhaps, 10, j, cm, 3, for, metal, nanotubes, human, biceps, could, be, replaced, with, an, 8, mm, diameter, wire, of, this, material, such, compact, muscle, might, allow, future, robots, to, outrun, and, outjump, humans, sensors, allow, robots, to, receive, information, about, a, certain, measurement, of, the, environment, or, internal, components, this, is, essential, for, robots, to, perform, their, tasks, and, act, upon, any, changes, in, the, environment, to, calculate, the, appropriate, response, they, are, used, for, various, forms, of, measurements, to, give, the, robots, warnings, about, safety, or, malfunctions, and, to, provide, real, time, information, about, the, task, it, is, performing, current, robotic, and, prosthetic, hands, receive, far, less, tactile, information, than, the, human, hand, recent, research, has, developed, a, tactile, sensor, array, that, mimics, the, mechanical, properties, and, touch, receptors, of, human, fingertips, the, sensor, array, is, constructed, as, a, rigid, core, surrounded, by, conductive, fluid, contained, by, an, elastomeric, skin, electrodes, are, mounted, on, the, surface, of, the, rigid, core, and, are, connected, to, an, impedance, measuring, device, within, the, core, when, the, artificial, skin, touches, an, object, the, fluid, path, around, the, electrodes, is, deformed, producing, impedance, changes, that, map, the, forces, received, from, the, object, the, researchers, expect, that, an, important, function, of, such, artificial, fingertips, will, be, adjusting, the, robotic, grip, on, held, objects, scientists, from, several, european, countries, and, israel, developed, a, prosthetic, hand, in, 2009, called, smarthand, which, functions, like, a, real, one, allowing, patients, to, write, with, it, type, on, a, keyboard, play, piano, and, perform, other, fine, movements, the, prosthesis, has, sensors, which, enable, the, patient, to, sense, real, feelings, in, its, fingertips, other, common, forms, of, sensing, in, robotics, use, lidar, radar, and, sonar, lidar, measures, the, distance, to, a, target, by, illuminating, the, target, with, laser, light, and, measuring, the, reflected, light, with, a, sensor, radar, uses, radio, waves, to, determine, the, range, angle, or, velocity, of, objects, sonar, uses, sound, propagation, to, navigate, communicate, with, or, detect, objects, on, or, under, the, surface, of, the, water, one, of, the, most, common, types, of, end, effectors, are, grippers, in, its, simplest, manifestation, it, consists, of, just, two, fingers, that, can, open, and, close, to, pick, up, and, let, go, of, a, range, of, small, objects, fingers, can, for, example, be, made, of, a, chain, with, a, metal, wire, running, through, it, hands, that, resemble, and, work, more, like, a, human, hand, include, the, shadow, hand, and, the, robonaut, hand, hands, that, are, of, a, mid, level, complexity, include, the, delft, hand, mechanical, grippers, can, come, in, various, types, including, friction, and, encompassing, jaws, friction, jaws, use, all, the, force, of, the, gripper, to, hold, the, object, in, place, using, friction, encompassing, jaws, cradle, the, object, in, place, using, less, friction, suction, end, effectors, powered, by, vacuum, generators, are, very, simple, astrictive, devices, that, can, hold, very, large, loads, provided, the, prehension, surface, is, smooth, enough, to, ensure, suction, pick, and, place, robots, for, electronic, components, and, for, large, objects, like, car, windscreens, often, use, very, simple, vacuum, end, effectors, suction, is, a, highly, used, type, of, end, effector, in, industry, in, part, because, the, natural, compliance, of, soft, suction, end, effectors, can, enable, a, robot, to, be, more, robust, in, the, presence, of, imperfect, robotic, perception, as, an, example, consider, the, case, of, a, robot, vision, system, that, estimates, the, position, of, a, water, bottle, but, has, 1, centimeter, of, error, while, this, may, cause, a, rigid, mechanical, gripper, to, puncture, the, water, bottle, the, soft, suction, end, effector, may, just, bend, slightly, and, conform, to, the, shape, of, the, water, bottle, surface, some, advanced, robots, are, beginning, to, use, fully, humanoid, hands, like, the, shadow, hand, manus, and, the, schunk, hand, they, have, powerful, robot, dexterity, intelligence, rdi, with, as, many, as, 20, degrees, of, freedom, and, hundreds, of, tactile, sensors, the, mechanical, structure, of, a, robot, must, be, controlled, to, perform, tasks, the, control, of, a, robot, involves, three, distinct, phases, perception, processing, and, action, robotic, paradigms, sensors, give, information, about, the, environment, or, the, robot, itself, e, g, the, position, of, its, joints, or, its, end, effector, this, information, is, then, processed, to, be, stored, or, transmitted, and, to, calculate, the, appropriate, signals, to, the, actuators, motors, which, move, the, mechanical, structure, to, achieve, the, required, co, ordinated, motion, or, force, actions, the, processing, phase, can, range, in, complexity, at, a, reactive, level, it, may, translate, raw, sensor, information, directly, into, actuator, commands, e, g, firing, motor, power, electronic, gates, based, directly, upon, encoder, feedback, signals, to, achieve, the, required, torque, velocity, of, the, shaft, sensor, fusion, and, internal, models, may, first, be, used, to, estimate, parameters, of, interest, e, g, the, position, of, the, robot, s, gripper, from, noisy, sensor, data, an, immediate, task, such, as, moving, the, gripper, in, a, certain, direction, until, an, object, is, detected, with, a, proximity, sensor, is, sometimes, inferred, from, these, estimates, techniques, from, control, theory, are, generally, used, to, convert, the, higher, level, tasks, into, individual, commands, that, drive, the, actuators, most, often, using, kinematic, and, dynamic, models, of, the, mechanical, structure, at, longer, time, scales, or, with, more, sophisticated, tasks, the, robot, may, need, to, build, and, reason, with, a, cognitive, model, cognitive, models, try, to, represent, the, robot, the, world, and, how, the, two, interact, pattern, recognition, and, computer, vision, can, be, used, to, track, objects, mapping, techniques, can, be, used, to, build, maps, of, the, world, finally, motion, planning, and, other, artificial, intelligence, techniques, may, be, used, to, figure, out, how, to, act, for, example, a, planner, may, figure, out, how, to, achieve, a, task, without, hitting, obstacles, falling, over, etc, modern, commercial, robotic, control, systems, are, highly, complex, integrate, multiple, sensors, and, effectors, have, many, interacting, degrees, of, freedom, dof, and, require, operator, interfaces, programming, tools, and, real, time, capabilities, they, are, oftentimes, interconnected, to, wider, communication, networks, and, in, many, cases, are, now, both, iot, enabled, and, mobile, progress, towards, open, architecture, layered, user, friendly, and, intelligent, sensor, based, interconnected, robots, has, emerged, from, earlier, concepts, related, to, flexible, manufacturing, systems, fms, and, several, open, or, hybrid, reference, architectures, exist, which, assist, developers, of, robot, control, software, and, hardware, to, move, beyond, traditional, earlier, notions, of, closed, robot, control, systems, have, been, proposed, open, architecture, controllers, are, said, to, be, better, able, to, meet, the, growing, requirements, of, a, wide, range, of, robot, users, including, system, developers, end, users, and, research, scientists, and, are, better, positioned, to, deliver, the, advanced, robotic, concepts, related, to, industry, 4, 0, in, addition, to, utilizing, many, established, features, of, robot, controllers, such, as, position, velocity, and, force, control, of, end, effectors, they, also, enable, iot, interconnection, and, the, implementation, of, more, advanced, sensor, fusion, and, control, techniques, including, adaptive, control, fuzzy, control, and, artificial, neural, network, ann, based, control, when, implemented, in, real, time, such, techniques, can, potentially, improve, the, stability, and, performance, of, robots, operating, in, unknown, or, uncertain, environments, by, enabling, the, control, systems, to, learn, and, adapt, to, environmental, changes, there, are, several, examples, of, reference, architectures, for, robot, controllers, and, also, examples, of, successful, implementations, of, actual, robot, controllers, developed, from, them, one, example, of, a, generic, reference, architecture, and, associated, interconnected, open, architecture, robot, and, controller, implementation, was, used, in, a, number, of, research, and, development, studies, including, prototype, implementation, of, novel, advanced, and, intelligent, control, and, environment, mapping, methods, in, real, time, a, definition, of, robotic, manipulation, has, been, provided, by, matt, mason, as, manipulation, refers, to, an, agent, s, control, of, its, environment, through, selective, contact, robots, need, to, manipulate, objects, pick, up, modify, destroy, move, or, otherwise, have, an, effect, thus, the, functional, end, of, a, robot, arm, intended, to, make, the, effect, whether, a, hand, or, tool, are, often, referred, to, as, end, effectors, while, the, arm, is, referred, to, as, a, manipulator, most, robot, arms, have, replaceable, end, effectors, each, allowing, them, to, perform, some, small, range, of, tasks, some, have, a, fixed, manipulator, that, cannot, be, replaced, while, a, few, have, one, very, general, purpose, manipulator, for, example, a, humanoid, hand, for, simplicity, most, mobile, robots, have, four, wheels, or, a, number, of, continuous, tracks, some, researchers, have, tried, to, create, more, complex, wheeled, robots, with, only, one, or, two, wheels, these, can, have, certain, advantages, such, as, greater, efficiency, and, reduced, parts, as, well, as, allowing, a, robot, to, navigate, in, confined, places, that, a, four, wheeled, robot, would, not, be, able, to, balancing, robots, generally, use, a, gyroscope, to, detect, how, much, a, robot, is, falling, and, then, drive, the, wheels, proportionally, in, the, same, direction, to, counterbalance, the, fall, at, hundreds, of, times, per, second, based, on, the, dynamics, of, an, inverted, pendulum, many, different, balancing, robots, have, been, designed, while, the, segway, is, not, commonly, thought, of, as, a, robot, it, can, be, thought, of, as, a, component, of, a, robot, when, used, as, such, segway, refer, to, them, as, rmp, robotic, mobility, platform, an, example, of, this, use, has, been, as, nasa, s, robonaut, that, has, been, mounted, on, a, segway, a, one, wheeled, balancing, robot, is, an, extension, of, a, two, wheeled, balancing, robot, so, that, it, can, move, in, any, 2d, direction, using, a, round, ball, as, its, only, wheel, several, one, wheeled, balancing, robots, have, been, designed, recently, such, as, carnegie, mellon, university, s, ballbot, which, is, the, approximate, height, and, width, of, a, person, and, tohoku, gakuin, university, s, ballip, because, of, the, long, thin, shape, and, ability, to, maneuver, in, tight, spaces, they, have, the, potential, to, function, better, than, other, robots, in, environments, with, people, several, attempts, have, been, made, in, robots, that, are, completely, inside, a, spherical, ball, either, by, spinning, a, weight, inside, the, ball, or, by, rotating, the, outer, shells, of, the, sphere, these, have, also, been, referred, to, as, an, orb, bot, or, a, ball, bot, using, six, wheels, instead, of, four, wheels, can, give, better, traction, or, grip, in, outdoor, terrain, such, as, on, rocky, dirt, or, grass, tracks, provide, even, more, traction, than, a, six, wheeled, robot, tracked, wheels, behave, as, if, they, were, made, of, hundreds, of, wheels, therefore, are, very, common, for, outdoor, off, road, robots, where, the, robot, must, drive, on, very, rough, terrain, however, they, are, difficult, to, use, indoors, such, as, on, carpets, and, smooth, floors, examples, include, nasa, s, urban, robot, urbie, walking, is, a, difficult, and, dynamic, problem, to, solve, several, robots, have, been, made, which, can, walk, reliably, on, two, legs, however, none, have, yet, been, made, which, are, as, robust, as, a, human, there, has, been, much, study, on, human, inspired, walking, such, as, amber, lab, which, was, established, in, 2008, by, the, mechanical, engineering, department, at, texas, a, m, university, many, other, robots, have, been, built, that, walk, on, more, than, two, legs, due, to, these, robots, being, significantly, easier, to, construct, walking, robots, can, be, used, for, uneven, terrains, which, would, provide, better, mobility, and, energy, efficiency, than, other, locomotion, methods, typically, robots, on, two, legs, can, walk, well, on, flat, floors, and, can, occasionally, walk, up, stairs, none, can, walk, over, rocky, uneven, terrain, some, of, the, methods, which, have, been, tried, are, the, zero, moment, point, zmp, is, the, algorithm, used, by, robots, such, as, honda, s, asimo, the, robot, s, onboard, computer, tries, to, keep, the, total, inertial, forces, the, combination, of, earth, s, gravity, and, the, acceleration, and, deceleration, of, walking, exactly, opposed, by, the, floor, reaction, force, the, force, of, the, floor, pushing, back, on, the, robot, s, foot, in, this, way, the, two, forces, cancel, out, leaving, no, moment, force, causing, the, robot, to, rotate, and, fall, over, however, this, is, not, exactly, how, a, human, walks, and, the, difference, is, obvious, to, human, observers, some, of, whom, have, pointed, out, that, asimo, walks, as, if, it, needs, the, lavatory, asimo, s, walking, algorithm, is, not, static, and, some, dynamic, balancing, is, used, see, below, however, it, still, requires, a, smooth, surface, to, walk, on, several, robots, built, in, the, 1980s, by, marc, raibert, at, the, mit, leg, laboratory, successfully, demonstrated, very, dynamic, walking, initially, a, robot, with, only, one, leg, and, a, very, small, foot, could, stay, upright, simply, by, hopping, the, movement, is, the, same, as, that, of, a, person, on, a, pogo, stick, as, the, robot, falls, to, one, side, it, would, jump, slightly, in, that, direction, in, order, to, catch, itself, soon, the, algorithm, was, generalised, to, two, and, four, legs, a, bipedal, robot, was, demonstrated, running, and, even, performing, somersaults, a, quadruped, was, also, demonstrated, which, could, trot, run, pace, and, bound, for, a, full, list, of, these, robots, see, the, mit, leg, lab, robots, page, a, more, advanced, way, for, a, robot, to, walk, is, by, using, a, dynamic, balancing, algorithm, which, is, potentially, more, robust, than, the, zero, moment, point, technique, as, it, constantly, monitors, the, robot, s, motion, and, places, the, feet, in, order, to, maintain, stability, this, technique, was, recently, demonstrated, by, anybots, dexter, robot, which, is, so, stable, it, can, even, jump, another, example, is, the, tu, delft, flame, perhaps, the, most, promising, approach, uses, passive, dynamics, where, the, momentum, of, swinging, limbs, is, used, for, greater, efficiency, it, has, been, shown, that, totally, unpowered, humanoid, mechanisms, can, walk, down, a, gentle, slope, using, only, gravity, to, propel, themselves, using, this, technique, a, robot, need, only, supply, a, small, amount, of, motor, power, to, walk, along, a, flat, surface, or, a, little, more, to, walk, up, a, hill, this, technique, promises, to, make, walking, robots, at, least, ten, times, more, efficient, than, zmp, walkers, like, asimo, a, modern, passenger, airliner, is, essentially, a, flying, robot, with, two, humans, to, manage, it, the, autopilot, can, control, the, plane, for, each, stage, of, the, journey, including, takeoff, normal, flight, and, even, landing, other, flying, robots, are, uninhabited, and, are, known, as, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, uavs, they, can, be, smaller, and, lighter, without, a, human, pilot, on, board, and, fly, into, dangerous, territory, for, military, surveillance, missions, some, can, even, fire, on, targets, under, command, uavs, are, also, being, developed, which, can, fire, on, targets, automatically, without, the, need, for, a, command, from, a, human, other, flying, robots, include, cruise, missiles, the, entomopter, and, the, epson, micro, helicopter, robot, robots, such, as, the, air, penguin, air, ray, and, air, jelly, have, lighter, than, air, bodies, are, propelled, by, paddles, and, are, guided, by, sonar, bfrs, take, inspiration, from, flying, mammals, birds, or, insects, bfrs, can, have, flapping, wings, which, generate, the, lift, and, thrust, or, they, can, be, propeller, actuated, bfrs, with, flapping, wings, have, increased, stroke, efficiencies, increased, maneuverability, and, reduced, energy, consumption, in, comparison, to, propeller, actuated, bfrs, mammal, and, bird, inspired, bfrs, share, similar, flight, characteristics, and, design, considerations, for, instance, both, mammal, and, bird, inspired, bfrs, minimize, edge, fluttering, and, pressure, induced, wingtip, curl, by, increasing, the, rigidity, of, the, wing, edge, and, wingtips, mammal, and, insect, inspired, bfrs, can, be, impact, resistant, making, them, useful, in, cluttered, environments, mammal, inspired, bfrs, typically, take, inspiration, from, bats, but, the, flying, squirrel, has, also, inspired, a, prototype, examples, of, bat, inspired, bfrs, include, bat, bot, and, the, daler, mammal, inspired, bfrs, can, be, designed, to, be, multi, modal, therefore, they, re, capable, of, both, flight, and, terrestrial, movement, to, reduce, the, impact, of, landing, shock, absorbers, can, be, implemented, along, the, wings, alternatively, the, bfr, can, pitch, up, and, increase, the, amount, of, drag, it, experiences, by, increasing, the, drag, force, the, bfr, will, decelerate, and, minimize, the, impact, upon, grounding, different, land, gait, patterns, can, also, be, implemented, bird, inspired, bfrs, can, take, inspiration, from, raptors, gulls, and, everything, in, between, bird, inspired, bfrs, can, be, feathered, to, increase, the, angle, of, attack, range, over, which, the, prototype, can, operate, before, stalling, the, wings, of, bird, inspired, bfrs, allow, for, in, plane, deformation, and, the, in, plane, wing, deformation, can, be, adjusted, to, maximize, flight, efficiency, depending, on, the, flight, gait, an, example, of, a, raptor, inspired, bfr, is, the, prototype, by, savastano, et, al, the, prototype, has, fully, deformable, flapping, wings, and, is, capable, of, carrying, a, payload, of, up, to, 0, 8, kg, while, performing, a, parabolic, climb, steep, descent, and, rapid, recovery, the, gull, inspired, prototype, by, grant, et, al, accurately, mimics, the, elbow, and, wrist, rotation, of, gulls, and, they, find, that, lift, generation, is, maximized, when, the, elbow, and, wrist, deformations, are, opposite, but, equal, insect, inspired, bfrs, typically, take, inspiration, from, beetles, or, dragonflies, an, example, of, a, beetle, inspired, bfr, is, the, prototype, by, phan, and, park, and, a, dragonfly, inspired, bfr, is, the, prototype, by, hu, et, al, the, flapping, frequency, of, insect, inspired, bfrs, are, much, higher, than, those, of, other, bfrs, this, is, because, of, the, aerodynamics, of, insect, flight, insect, inspired, bfrs, are, much, smaller, than, those, inspired, by, mammals, or, birds, so, they, are, more, suitable, for, dense, environments, a, class, of, robots, that, are, biologically, inspired, but, which, do, not, attempt, to, mimic, biology, are, creations, such, as, the, entomopter, funded, by, darpa, nasa, the, united, states, air, force, and, the, georgia, tech, research, institute, and, patented, by, prof, robert, c, michelson, for, covert, terrestrial, missions, as, well, as, flight, in, the, lower, mars, atmosphere, the, entomopter, flight, propulsion, system, uses, low, reynolds, number, wings, similar, to, those, of, the, hawk, moth, manduca, sexta, but, flaps, them, in, a, non, traditional, opposed, x, wing, fashion, while, blowing, the, surface, to, enhance, lift, based, on, the, coand, effect, as, well, as, to, control, vehicle, attitude, and, direction, waste, gas, from, the, propulsion, system, not, only, facilitates, the, blown, wing, aerodynamics, but, also, serves, to, create, ultrasonic, emissions, like, that, of, a, bat, for, obstacle, avoidance, the, entomopter, and, other, biologically, inspired, robots, leverage, features, of, biological, systems, but, do, not, attempt, to, create, mechanical, analogs, several, snake, robots, have, been, successfully, developed, mimicking, the, way, real, snakes, move, these, robots, can, navigate, very, confined, spaces, meaning, they, may, one, day, be, used, to, search, for, people, trapped, in, collapsed, buildings, the, japanese, acm, r5, snake, robot, can, even, navigate, both, on, land, and, in, water, a, small, number, of, skating, robots, have, been, developed, one, of, which, is, a, multi, mode, walking, and, skating, device, it, has, four, legs, with, unpowered, wheels, which, can, either, step, or, roll, another, robot, plen, can, use, a, miniature, skateboard, or, roller, skates, and, skate, across, a, desktop, several, different, approaches, have, been, used, to, develop, robots, that, have, the, ability, to, climb, vertical, surfaces, one, approach, mimics, the, movements, of, a, human, climber, on, a, wall, with, protrusions, adjusting, the, center, of, mass, and, moving, each, limb, in, turn, to, gain, leverage, an, example, of, this, is, capuchin, built, by, ruixiang, zhang, at, stanford, university, california, another, approach, uses, the, specialized, toe, pad, method, of, wall, climbing, geckoes, which, can, run, on, smooth, surfaces, such, as, vertical, glass, examples, of, this, approach, include, wallbot, and, stickybot, china, s, technology, daily, reported, on, 15, november, 2008, that, li, hiu, yeung, and, his, research, group, of, new, concept, aircraft, zhuhai, co, ltd, had, successfully, developed, a, bionic, gecko, robot, named, speedy, freelander, according, to, yeung, the, gecko, robot, could, rapidly, climb, up, and, down, a, variety, of, building, walls, navigate, through, ground, and, wall, fissures, and, walk, upside, down, on, the, ceiling, it, was, also, able, to, adapt, to, the, surfaces, of, smooth, glass, rough, sticky, or, dusty, walls, as, well, as, various, types, of, metallic, materials, it, could, also, identify, and, circumvent, obstacles, automatically, its, flexibility, and, speed, were, comparable, to, a, natural, gecko, a, third, approach, is, to, mimic, the, motion, of, a, snake, climbing, a, pole, it, is, calculated, that, when, swimming, some, fish, can, achieve, a, propulsive, efficiency, greater, than, 90, furthermore, they, can, accelerate, and, maneuver, far, better, than, any, man, made, boat, or, submarine, and, produce, less, noise, and, water, disturbance, therefore, many, researchers, studying, underwater, robots, would, like, to, copy, this, type, of, locomotion, notable, examples, are, the, robotic, fish, g9, and, robot, tuna, built, to, analyze, and, mathematically, model, thunniform, motion, the, aqua, penguin, copies, the, streamlined, shape, and, propulsion, by, front, flippers, of, penguins, the, aqua, ray, and, aqua, jelly, emulate, the, locomotion, of, manta, ray, and, jellyfish, respectively, in, 2014, isplash, ii, was, developed, as, the, first, robotic, fish, capable, of, outperforming, real, carangiform, fish, in, terms, of, average, maximum, velocity, measured, in, body, lengths, second, and, endurance, the, duration, that, top, speed, is, maintained, this, build, attained, swimming, speeds, of, 11, 6bl, s, i, e, 3, 7, m, s, the, first, build, isplash, i, 2014, was, the, first, robotic, platform, to, apply, a, full, body, length, carangiform, swimming, motion, which, was, found, to, increase, swimming, speed, by, 27, over, the, traditional, approach, of, a, posterior, confined, waveform, sailboat, robots, have, also, been, developed, in, order, to, make, measurements, at, the, surface, of, the, ocean, a, typical, sailboat, robot, is, vaimos, since, the, propulsion, of, sailboat, robots, uses, the, wind, the, energy, of, the, batteries, is, only, used, for, the, computer, for, the, communication, and, for, the, actuators, to, tune, the, rudder, and, the, sail, if, the, robot, is, equipped, with, solar, panels, the, robot, could, theoretically, navigate, forever, the, two, main, competitions, of, sailboat, robots, are, wrsc, which, takes, place, every, year, in, europe, and, sailbot, control, systems, may, also, have, varying, levels, of, autonomy, another, classification, takes, into, account, the, interaction, between, human, control, and, the, machine, motions, computer, vision, is, the, science, and, technology, of, machines, that, see, as, a, scientific, discipline, computer, vision, is, concerned, with, the, theory, behind, artificial, systems, that, extract, information, from, images, the, image, data, can, take, many, forms, such, as, video, sequences, and, views, from, cameras, in, most, practical, computer, vision, applications, the, computers, are, pre, programmed, to, solve, a, particular, task, but, methods, based, on, learning, are, now, becoming, increasingly, common, computer, vision, systems, rely, on, image, sensors, that, detect, electromagnetic, radiation, which, is, typically, in, the, form, of, either, visible, light, or, infra, red, light, the, sensors, are, designed, using, solid, state, physics, the, process, by, which, light, propagates, and, reflects, off, surfaces, is, explained, using, optics, sophisticated, image, sensors, even, require, quantum, mechanics, to, provide, a, complete, understanding, of, the, image, formation, process, robots, can, also, be, equipped, with, multiple, vision, sensors, to, be, better, able, to, compute, the, sense, of, depth, in, the, environment, like, human, eyes, robots, eyes, must, also, be, able, to, focus, on, a, particular, area, of, interest, and, also, adjust, to, variations, in, light, intensities, there, is, a, subfield, within, computer, vision, where, artificial, systems, are, designed, to, mimic, the, processing, and, behavior, of, biological, system, at, different, levels, of, complexity, also, some, of, the, learning, based, methods, developed, within, computer, vision, have, a, background, in, biology, though, a, significant, percentage, of, robots, in, commission, today, are, either, human, controlled, or, operate, in, a, static, environment, there, is, an, increasing, interest, in, robots, that, can, operate, autonomously, in, a, dynamic, environment, these, robots, require, some, combination, of, navigation, hardware, and, software, in, order, to, traverse, their, environment, in, particular, unforeseen, events, e, g, people, and, other, obstacles, that, are, not, stationary, can, cause, problems, or, collisions, some, highly, advanced, robots, such, as, asimo, and, mein, robot, have, particularly, good, robot, navigation, hardware, and, software, also, self, controlled, cars, ernst, dickmanns, driverless, car, and, the, entries, in, the, darpa, grand, challenge, are, capable, of, sensing, the, environment, well, and, subsequently, making, navigational, decisions, based, on, this, information, including, by, a, swarm, of, autonomous, robots, most, of, these, robots, employ, a, gps, navigation, device, with, waypoints, along, with, radar, sometimes, combined, with, other, sensory, data, such, as, lidar, video, cameras, and, inertial, guidance, systems, for, better, navigation, between, waypoints, the, state, of, the, art, in, sensory, intelligence, for, robots, will, have, to, progress, through, several, orders, of, magnitude, if, we, want, the, robots, working, in, our, homes, to, go, beyond, vacuum, cleaning, the, floors, if, robots, are, to, work, effectively, in, homes, and, other, non, industrial, environments, the, way, they, are, instructed, to, perform, their, jobs, and, especially, how, they, will, be, told, to, stop, will, be, of, critical, importance, the, people, who, interact, with, them, may, have, little, or, no, training, in, robotics, and, so, any, interface, will, need, to, be, extremely, intuitive, science, fiction, authors, also, typically, assume, that, robots, will, eventually, be, capable, of, communicating, with, humans, through, speech, gestures, and, facial, expressions, rather, than, a, command, line, interface, although, speech, would, be, the, most, natural, way, for, the, human, to, communicate, it, is, unnatural, for, the, robot, it, will, probably, be, a, long, time, before, robots, interact, as, naturally, as, the, fictional, c, 3po, or, data, of, star, trek, next, generation, even, though, the, current, state, of, robotics, cannot, meet, the, standards, of, these, robots, from, science, fiction, robotic, media, characters, e, g, wall, e, r2, d2, can, elicit, audience, sympathies, that, increase, people, s, willingness, to, accept, actual, robots, in, the, future, acceptance, of, social, robots, is, also, likely, to, increase, if, people, can, meet, a, social, robot, under, appropriate, conditions, studies, have, shown, that, interacting, with, a, robot, by, looking, at, touching, or, even, imagining, interacting, with, the, robot, can, reduce, negative, feelings, that, some, people, have, about, robots, before, interacting, with, them, however, if, pre, existing, negative, sentiments, are, especially, strong, interacting, with, a, robot, can, increase, those, negative, feelings, towards, robots, interpreting, the, continuous, flow, of, sounds, coming, from, a, human, in, real, time, is, a, difficult, task, for, a, computer, mostly, because, of, the, great, variability, of, speech, the, same, word, spoken, by, the, same, person, may, sound, different, depending, on, local, acoustics, volume, the, previous, word, whether, or, not, the, speaker, has, a, cold, etc, it, becomes, even, harder, when, the, speaker, has, a, different, accent, nevertheless, great, strides, have, been, made, in, the, field, since, davis, biddulph, and, balashek, designed, the, first, voice, input, system, which, recognized, ten, digits, spoken, by, a, single, user, with, 100, accuracy, in, 1952, currently, the, best, systems, can, recognize, continuous, natural, speech, up, to, 160, words, per, minute, with, an, accuracy, of, 95, with, the, help, of, artificial, intelligence, machines, nowadays, can, use, people, s, voice, to, identify, their, emotions, such, as, satisfied, or, angry, other, hurdles, exist, when, allowing, the, robot, to, use, voice, for, interacting, with, humans, for, social, reasons, synthetic, voice, proves, suboptimal, as, a, communication, medium, making, it, necessary, to, develop, the, emotional, component, of, robotic, voice, through, various, techniques, an, advantage, of, diphonic, branching, is, the, emotion, that, the, robot, is, programmed, to, project, can, be, carried, on, the, voice, tape, or, phoneme, already, pre, programmed, onto, the, voice, media, one, of, the, earliest, examples, is, a, teaching, robot, named, leachim, developed, in, 1974, by, michael, j, freeman, leachim, was, able, to, convert, digital, memory, to, rudimentary, verbal, speech, on, pre, recorded, computer, discs, it, was, programmed, to, teach, students, in, the, bronx, new, york, facial, expressions, can, provide, rapid, feedback, on, the, progress, of, a, dialog, between, two, humans, and, soon, may, be, able, to, do, the, same, for, humans, and, robots, robotic, faces, have, been, constructed, by, hanson, robotics, using, their, elastic, polymer, called, frubber, allowing, a, large, number, of, facial, expressions, due, to, the, elasticity, of, the, rubber, facial, coating, and, embedded, subsurface, motors, servos, the, coating, and, servos, are, built, on, a, metal, skull, a, robot, should, know, how, to, approach, a, human, judging, by, their, facial, expression, and, body, language, whether, the, person, is, happy, frightened, or, crazy, looking, affects, the, type, of, interaction, expected, of, the, robot, likewise, robots, like, kismet, and, the, more, recent, addition, nexi, can, produce, a, range, of, facial, expressions, allowing, it, to, have, meaningful, social, exchanges, with, humans, one, can, imagine, in, the, future, explaining, to, a, robot, chef, how, to, make, a, pastry, or, asking, directions, from, a, robot, police, officer, in, both, of, these, cases, making, hand, gestures, would, aid, the, verbal, descriptions, in, the, first, case, the, robot, would, be, recognizing, gestures, made, by, the, human, and, perhaps, repeating, them, for, confirmation, in, the, second, case, the, robot, police, officer, would, gesture, to, indicate, down, the, road, then, turn, right, it, is, likely, that, gestures, will, make, up, a, part, of, the, interaction, between, humans, and, robots, a, great, many, systems, have, been, developed, to, recognize, human, hand, gestures, proxemics, is, the, study, of, personal, space, and, hri, systems, may, try, to, model, and, work, with, its, concepts, for, human, interactions, artificial, emotions, can, also, be, generated, composed, of, a, sequence, of, facial, expressions, or, gestures, as, can, be, seen, from, the, movie, final, fantasy, the, spirits, within, the, programming, of, these, artificial, emotions, is, complex, and, requires, a, large, amount, of, human, observation, to, simplify, this, programming, in, the, movie, presets, were, created, together, with, a, special, software, program, this, decreased, the, amount, of, time, needed, to, make, the, film, these, presets, could, possibly, be, transferred, for, use, in, real, life, robots, an, example, of, a, robot, with, artificial, emotions, is, robin, the, robot, developed, by, an, armenian, it, company, expper, technologies, which, uses, ai, based, peer, to, peer, interaction, its, main, task, is, achieving, emotional, well, being, i, e, overcome, stress, and, anxiety, robin, was, trained, to, analyze, facial, expressions, and, use, his, face, to, display, his, emotions, given, the, context, the, robot, has, been, tested, by, kids, in, us, clinics, and, observations, show, that, robin, increased, the, appetite, and, cheerfulness, of, children, after, meeting, and, talking, many, of, the, robots, of, science, fiction, have, a, personality, something, which, may, or, may, not, be, desirable, in, the, commercial, robots, of, the, future, nevertheless, researchers, are, trying, to, create, robots, which, appear, to, have, a, personality, i, e, they, use, sounds, facial, expressions, and, body, language, to, try, to, convey, an, internal, state, which, may, be, joy, sadness, or, fear, one, commercial, example, is, pleo, a, toy, robot, dinosaur, which, can, exhibit, several, apparent, emotions, much, of, the, research, in, robotics, focuses, not, on, specific, industrial, tasks, but, on, investigations, into, new, types, of, robots, alternative, ways, to, think, about, or, design, robots, and, new, ways, to, manufacture, them, other, investigations, such, as, mit, s, cyberflora, project, are, almost, wholly, academic, to, describe, the, level, of, advancement, of, a, robot, the, term, generation, robots, can, be, used, this, term, is, coined, by, professor, hans, moravec, principal, research, scientist, at, the, carnegie, mellon, university, robotics, institute, in, describing, the, near, future, evolution, of, robot, technology, first, generation, robots, moravec, predicted, in, 1997, should, have, an, intellectual, capacity, comparable, to, perhaps, a, lizard, and, should, become, available, by, 2010, because, the, first, generation, robot, would, be, incapable, of, learning, however, moravec, predicts, that, the, second, generation, robot, would, be, an, improvement, over, the, first, and, become, available, by, 2020, with, the, intelligence, maybe, comparable, to, that, of, a, mouse, the, third, generation, robot, should, have, intelligence, comparable, to, that, of, a, monkey, though, fourth, generation, robots, robots, with, human, intelligence, professor, moravec, predicts, would, become, possible, he, does, not, predict, this, happening, before, around, 2040, or, 2050, the, study, of, motion, can, be, divided, into, kinematics, and, dynamics, direct, kinematics, or, forward, kinematics, refers, to, the, calculation, of, end, effector, position, orientation, velocity, and, acceleration, when, the, corresponding, joint, values, are, known, inverse, kinematics, refers, to, the, opposite, case, in, which, required, joint, values, are, calculated, for, given, end, effector, values, as, done, in, path, planning, some, special, aspects, of, kinematics, include, handling, of, redundancy, different, possibilities, of, performing, the, same, movement, collision, avoidance, and, singularity, avoidance, once, all, relevant, positions, velocities, and, accelerations, have, been, calculated, using, kinematics, methods, from, the, field, of, dynamics, are, used, to, study, the, effect, of, forces, upon, these, movements, direct, dynamics, refers, to, the, calculation, of, accelerations, in, the, robot, once, the, applied, forces, are, known, direct, dynamics, is, used, in, computer, simulations, of, the, robot, inverse, dynamics, refers, to, the, calculation, of, the, actuator, forces, necessary, to, create, a, prescribed, end, effector, acceleration, this, information, can, be, used, to, improve, the, control, algorithms, of, a, robot, in, each, area, mentioned, above, researchers, strive, to, develop, new, concepts, and, strategies, improve, existing, ones, and, improve, the, interaction, between, these, areas, to, do, this, criteria, for, optimal, performance, and, ways, to, optimize, design, structure, and, control, of, robots, must, be, developed, and, implemented, open, source, robotics, research, seeks, standards, for, defining, and, methods, for, designing, and, building, robots, so, that, they, can, easily, be, reproduced, by, anyone, research, includes, legal, and, technical, definitions, seeking, out, alternative, tools, and, materials, to, reduce, costs, and, simplify, builds, and, creating, interfaces, and, standards, for, designs, to, work, together, human, usability, research, also, investigates, how, to, best, document, builds, through, visual, text, or, video, instructions, evolutionary, robots, is, a, methodology, that, uses, evolutionary, computation, to, help, design, robots, especially, the, body, form, or, motion, and, behavior, controllers, in, a, similar, way, to, natural, evolution, a, large, population, of, robots, is, allowed, to, compete, in, some, way, or, their, ability, to, perform, a, task, is, measured, using, a, fitness, function, those, that, perform, worst, are, removed, from, the, population, and, replaced, by, a, new, set, which, have, new, behaviors, based, on, those, of, the, winners, over, time, the, population, improves, and, eventually, a, satisfactory, robot, may, appear, this, happens, without, any, direct, programming, of, the, robots, by, the, researchers, researchers, use, this, method, both, to, create, better, robots, and, to, explore, the, nature, of, evolution, because, the, process, often, requires, many, generations, of, robots, to, be, simulated, this, technique, may, be, run, entirely, or, mostly, in, simulation, using, a, robot, simulator, software, package, then, tested, on, real, robots, once, the, evolved, algorithms, are, good, enough, currently, there, are, about, 10, million, industrial, robots, toiling, around, the, world, and, japan, is, the, top, country, having, high, density, of, utilizing, robots, in, its, manufacturing, industry, bionics, and, biomimetics, apply, the, physiology, and, methods, of, locomotion, of, animals, to, the, design, of, robots, for, example, the, design, of, bionickangaroo, was, based, on, the, way, kangaroos, jump, swarm, robotics, is, an, approach, to, the, coordination, of, multiple, robots, as, a, system, which, consist, of, large, numbers, of, mostly, simple, physical, robots, in, a, robot, swarm, the, collective, behavior, of, the, robots, results, from, local, interactions, between, the, robots, and, between, the, robots, and, the, environment, in, which, they, act, there, has, been, some, research, into, whether, robotics, algorithms, can, be, run, more, quickly, on, quantum, computers, than, they, can, be, run, on, digital, computers, this, area, has, been, referred, to, as, quantum, robotics, the, main, venues, for, robotics, research, are, the, international, conferences, icra, and, iros, robotics, engineers, design, robots, maintain, them, develop, new, applications, for, them, and, conduct, research, to, expand, the, potential, of, robotics, robots, have, become, a, popular, educational, tool, in, some, middle, and, high, schools, particularly, in, parts, of, the, usa, as, well, as, in, numerous, youth, summer, camps, raising, interest, in, programming, artificial, intelligence, and, robotics, among, students, robotics, is, an, essential, component, in, many, modern, manufacturing, environments, as, factories, increase, their, use, of, robots, the, number, of, robotics, related, jobs, grow, and, have, been, observed, to, be, steadily, rising, the, employment, of, robots, in, industries, has, increased, productivity, and, efficiency, savings, and, is, typically, seen, as, a, long, term, investment, for, benefactors, a, study, found, that, 47, percent, of, us, jobs, are, at, risk, to, automation, over, some, unspecified, number, of, years, these, claims, have, been, criticized, on, the, ground, that, social, policy, not, ai, causes, unemployment, in, a, 2016, article, in, the, guardian, stephen, hawking, stated, the, automation, of, factories, has, already, decimated, jobs, in, traditional, manufacturing, and, the, rise, of, artificial, intelligence, is, likely, to, extend, this, job, destruction, deep, into, the, middle, classes, with, only, the, most, caring, creative, or, supervisory, roles, remaining, the, rise, of, robotics, is, thus, often, used, as, an, argument, for, universal, basic, income, according, to, a, globaldata, september, 2021, report, the, robotics, industry, was, worth, 45bn, in, 2020, and, by, 2030, it, will, have, grown, at, a, compound, annual, growth, rate, cagr, of, 29, to, 568bn, driving, jobs, in, robotics, and, related, industries, a, discussion, paper, drawn, up, by, eu, osha, highlights, how, the, spread, of, robotics, presents, both, opportunities, and, challenges, for, occupational, safety, and, health, osh, the, greatest, osh, benefits, stemming, from, the, wider, use, of, robotics, should, be, substitution, for, people, working, in, unhealthy, or, dangerous, environments, in, space, defense, security, or, the, nuclear, industry, but, also, in, logistics, maintenance, and, inspection, autonomous, robots, are, particularly, useful, in, replacing, human, workers, performing, dirty, dull, or, unsafe, tasks, thus, avoiding, workers, exposures, to, hazardous, agents, and, conditions, and, reducing, physical, ergonomic, and, psychosocial, risks, for, example, robots, are, already, used, to, perform, repetitive, and, monotonous, tasks, to, handle, radioactive, material, or, to, work, in, explosive, atmospheres, in, the, future, many, other, highly, repetitive, risky, or, unpleasant, tasks, will, be, performed, by, robots, in, a, variety, of, sectors, like, agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting, or, cleaning, services, moreover, there, are, certain, skills, to, which, humans, will, be, better, suited, than, machines, for, some, time, to, come, and, the, question, is, how, to, achieve, the, best, combination, of, human, and, robot, skills, the, advantages, of, robotics, include, heavy, duty, jobs, with, precision, and, repeatability, whereas, the, advantages, of, humans, include, creativity, decision, making, flexibility, and, adaptability, this, need, to, combine, optimal, skills, has, resulted, in, collaborative, robots, and, humans, sharing, a, common, workspace, more, closely, and, led, to, the, development, of, new, approaches, and, standards, to, guarantee, the, safety, of, the, man, robot, merger, some, european, countries, are, including, robotics, in, their, national, programs, and, trying, to, promote, a, safe, and, flexible, cooperation, between, robots, and, operators, to, achieve, better, productivity, for, example, the, german, federal, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, baua, organises, annual, workshops, on, the, topic, human, robot, collaboration, in, the, future, cooperation, between, robots, and, humans, will, be, diversified, with, robots, increasing, their, autonomy, and, human, robot, collaboration, reaching, completely, new, forms, current, approaches, and, technical, standards, aiming, to, protect, employees, from, the, risk, of, working, with, collaborative, robots, will, have, to, be, revised, great, user, experience, predicts, the, needs, experiences, behaviors, language, and, cognitive, abilities, and, other, factors, of, each, user, group, it, then, uses, these, insights, to, produce, a, product, or, solution, that, is, ultimately, useful, and, usable, for, robots, user, experience, begins, with, an, understanding, of, the, robot, s, intended, task, and, environment, while, considering, any, possible, social, impact, the, robot, may, have, on, human, operations, and, interactions, with, it, it, defines, that, communication, as, the, transmission, of, information, through, signals, which, are, elements, perceived, through, touch, sound, smell, and, sight, the, author, states, that, the, signal, connects, the, sender, to, the, receiver, and, consists, of, three, parts, the, signal, itself, what, it, refers, to, and, the, interpreter, body, postures, and, gestures, facial, expressions, hand, and, head, movements, are, all, part, of, nonverbal, behavior, and, communication, robots, are, no, exception, when, it, comes, to, human, robot, interaction, therefore, humans, use, their, verbal, and, nonverbal, behaviors, to, communicate, their, defining, characteristics, similarly, social, robots, need, this, coordination, to, perform, human, like, behaviors, robotics, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, combining, primarily, mechanical, engineering, and, computer, science, but, also, drawing, on, electronic, engineering, and, other, subjects, the, usual, way, to, build, a, career, in, robotics, is, to, complete, an, undergraduate, degree, in, one, of, these, established, subjects, followed, by, a, graduate, masters, degree, in, robotics, graduate, degrees, are, typically, joined, by, students, coming, from, all, of, the, contributing, disciplines, and, include, familiarization, of, relevant, undergraduate, level, subject, matter, from, each, of, them, followed, by, specialist, study, in, pure, robotics, topics, which, build, upon, them, as, an, interdisciplinary, subject, robotics, graduate, programmes, tend, to, be, especially, reliant, on, students, working, and, learning, together, and, sharing, their, knowledge, and, skills, from, their, home, discipline, first, degrees, robotics, industry, careers, then, follow, the, same, pattern, with, most, roboticists, working, as, part, of, interdisciplinary, teams, of, specialists, from, these, home, disciplines, followed, by, the, robotics, graduate, degrees, which, enable, them, to, work, together, workers, typically, continue, to, identify, as, members, of, their, home, disciplines, who, work, in, robotics, rather, than, as, roboticists, this, structure, is, reinforced, by, the, nature, of, some, engineering, professions, which, grant, chartered, engineer, status, to, members, of, home, disciplines, rather, than, to, robotics, as, a, whole, robotics, careers, are, widely, predicted, to, grow, in, the, 21st, century, as, robots, replace, more, manual, and, intellectual, human, work, some, workers, who, lose, their, jobs, to, robotics, may, be, well, placed, to, retrain, to, build, and, maintain, these, robots, using, their, domain, specific, knowledge, and, skills
