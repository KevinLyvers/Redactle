a, bridge, is, a, structure, built, to, span, a, physical, obstacle, such, as, a, body, of, water, valley, road, or, railway, without, blocking, the, path, underneath, it, is, constructed, for, the, purpose, of, providing, passage, over, the, obstacle, which, is, usually, something, that, is, otherwise, difficult, or, impossible, to, cross, there, are, many, different, designs, of, bridges, each, serving, a, particular, purpose, and, applicable, to, different, situations, designs, of, bridges, vary, depending, on, factors, such, as, the, function, of, the, bridge, the, nature, of, the, terrain, where, the, bridge, is, constructed, and, anchored, the, material, used, to, make, it, and, the, funds, available, to, build, it, the, earliest, bridges, were, likely, made, with, fallen, trees, and, stepping, stones, the, neolithic, people, built, boardwalk, bridges, across, marshland, the, arkadiko, bridge, dating, from, the, 13th, century, bc, in, the, peloponnese, is, one, of, the, oldest, arch, bridges, in, existence, and, used, the, oxford, english, dictionary, traces, the, origin, of, the, word, bridge, to, an, old, english, word, brycg, of, the, same, meaning, bridge, 1, the, oxford, english, dictionary, also, notes, that, there, is, some, suggestion, that, the, word, can, be, traced, directly, back, to, proto, indo, european, b, r, w, however, they, also, note, that, this, poses, semantic, problems, the, origin, of, the, word, for, the, card, game, of, the, same, name, is, unknown, bridge, 2, the, simplest, and, earliest, types, of, bridges, were, stepping, stones, neolithic, people, also, built, a, form, of, boardwalk, across, marshes, examples, of, such, bridges, include, the, sweet, track, and, the, post, track, in, england, approximately, 6000, years, old, ancient, people, would, also, have, used, log, bridges, consisting, of, logs, that, fell, naturally, or, were, intentionally, felled, or, placed, across, streams, some, of, the, first, human, made, bridges, with, significant, span, were, probably, intentionally, felled, trees, among, the, oldest, timber, bridges, is, the, holzbr, cke, rapperswil, hurden, bridge, that, crossed, upper, lake, z, rich, in, switzerland, prehistoric, timber, pilings, discovered, to, the, west, of, the, seedamm, causeway, date, back, to, 1523, bc, the, first, wooden, footbridge, there, led, across, lake, z, rich, it, was, reconstructed, several, times, through, the, late, 2nd, century, ad, when, the, roman, empire, built, a, 6, metre, wide, 20, ft, wooden, bridge, to, carry, transport, across, the, lake, between, 1358, and, 1360, rudolf, iv, duke, of, austria, built, a, new, wooden, bridge, across, the, lake, that, was, used, until, 1878, it, was, approximately, 1, 450, metres, 4, 760, ft, long, and, 4, metres, 13, ft, wide, on, 6, april, 2001, a, reconstruction, of, the, original, wooden, footbridge, was, opened, it, is, also, the, longest, wooden, bridge, in, switzerland, the, arkadiko, bridge, is, one, of, four, mycenaean, corbel, arch, bridges, part, of, a, former, network, of, roads, designed, to, accommodate, chariots, between, the, fort, of, tiryns, and, town, of, epidauros, in, the, peloponnese, in, southern, greece, dating, to, the, greek, bronze, age, 13th, century, bc, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, arch, bridges, still, in, existence, and, use, several, intact, arched, stone, bridges, from, the, hellenistic, era, can, be, found, in, the, peloponnese, the, greatest, bridge, builders, of, antiquity, were, the, ancient, romans, the, romans, built, arch, bridges, and, aqueducts, that, could, stand, in, conditions, that, would, damage, or, destroy, earlier, designs, some, stand, today, an, example, is, the, alc, ntara, bridge, built, over, the, river, tagus, in, spain, the, romans, also, used, cement, which, reduced, the, variation, of, strength, found, in, natural, stone, one, type, of, cement, called, pozzolana, consisted, of, water, lime, sand, and, volcanic, rock, brick, and, mortar, bridges, were, built, after, the, roman, era, as, the, technology, for, cement, was, lost, then, later, rediscovered, in, india, the, arthashastra, treatise, by, kautilya, mentions, the, construction, of, dams, and, bridges, a, mauryan, bridge, near, girnar, was, surveyed, by, james, princep, the, bridge, was, swept, away, during, a, flood, and, later, repaired, by, puspagupta, the, chief, architect, of, emperor, chandragupta, i, the, use, of, stronger, bridges, using, plaited, bamboo, and, iron, chain, was, visible, in, india, by, about, the, 4th, century, a, number, of, bridges, both, for, military, and, commercial, purposes, were, constructed, by, the, mughal, administration, in, india, although, large, bridges, of, wooden, construction, existed, in, china, at, the, time, of, the, warring, states, period, the, oldest, surviving, stone, bridge, in, china, is, the, zhaozhou, bridge, built, from, 595, to, 605, ad, during, the, sui, dynasty, this, bridge, is, also, historically, significant, as, it, is, the, world, s, oldest, open, spandrel, stone, segmental, arch, bridge, european, segmental, arch, bridges, date, back, to, at, least, the, alcon, tar, bridge, approximately, 2nd, century, ad, while, the, enormous, roman, era, trajan, s, bridge, 105, ad, featured, open, spandrel, segmental, arches, in, wooden, construction, rope, bridges, a, simple, type, of, suspension, bridge, were, used, by, the, inca, civilization, in, the, andes, mountains, of, south, america, just, prior, to, european, colonization, in, the, 16th, century, the, ashanti, built, bridges, over, streams, and, rivers, they, were, constructed, by, pounding, four, large, forked, tree, trunks, into, the, stream, bed, placing, beams, along, these, forked, pillars, then, positioning, cross, beams, that, were, finally, covered, with, four, to, six, inches, of, dirt, during, the, 18th, century, there, were, many, innovations, in, the, design, of, timber, bridges, by, hans, ulrich, grubenmann, johannes, grubenmann, as, well, as, others, the, first, book, on, bridge, engineering, was, written, by, hubert, gautier, in, 1716, a, major, breakthrough, in, bridge, technology, came, with, the, erection, of, the, iron, bridge, in, shropshire, england, in, 1779, it, used, cast, iron, for, the, first, time, as, arches, to, cross, the, river, severn, with, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, 19th, century, truss, systems, of, wrought, iron, were, developed, for, larger, bridges, but, iron, does, not, have, the, tensile, strength, to, support, large, loads, with, the, advent, of, steel, which, has, a, high, tensile, strength, much, larger, bridges, were, built, many, using, the, ideas, of, gustave, eiffel, in, canada, and, the, united, states, numerous, timber, covered, bridges, were, built, in, the, late, 1700s, to, the, late, 1800s, reminiscent, of, earlier, designs, in, germany, and, switzerland, some, covered, bridges, were, also, built, in, asia, in, later, years, some, were, partly, made, of, stone, or, metal, but, the, trusses, were, usually, still, made, of, wood, in, the, united, states, there, were, three, styles, of, trusses, the, queen, post, the, burr, arch, and, the, town, lattice, hundreds, of, these, structures, still, stand, in, north, america, they, were, brought, to, the, attention, of, the, general, public, in, the, 1990s, by, the, novel, movie, and, play, the, bridges, of, madison, county, in, 1927, welding, pioneer, stefan, bry, a, designed, the, first, welded, road, bridge, in, the, world, the, maurzyce, bridge, which, was, later, built, across, the, river, s, udwia, at, maurzyce, near, owicz, poland, in, 1929, in, 1995, the, american, welding, society, presented, the, historic, welded, structure, award, for, the, bridge, to, poland, bridges, can, be, categorized, in, several, different, ways, common, categories, include, the, type, of, structural, elements, used, by, what, they, carry, whether, they, are, fixed, or, movable, and, by, the, materials, used, bridges, may, be, classified, by, how, the, actions, of, tension, compression, bending, torsion, and, shear, are, distributed, through, their, structure, most, bridges, will, employ, all, of, these, to, some, degree, but, only, a, few, will, predominate, the, separation, of, forces, and, moments, may, be, quite, clear, in, a, suspension, or, cable, stayed, bridge, the, elements, in, tension, are, distinct, in, shape, and, placement, in, other, cases, the, forces, may, be, distributed, among, a, large, number, of, members, as, in, a, truss, the, world, s, longest, beam, bridge, is, lake, pontchartrain, causeway, in, southern, louisiana, in, the, united, states, at, 23, 83, miles, 38, 35, km, with, individual, spans, of, 56, feet, 17, m, beam, bridges, are, the, simplest, and, oldest, type, of, bridge, in, use, today, and, are, a, popular, type, some, cantilever, bridges, also, have, a, smaller, beam, connecting, the, two, cantilevers, for, extra, strength, the, largest, cantilever, bridge, is, the, 549, metre, 1, 801, ft, quebec, bridge, in, quebec, canada, with, the, span, of, 220, metres, 720, ft, the, solkan, bridge, over, the, so, a, river, at, solkan, in, slovenia, is, the, second, largest, stone, bridge, in, the, world, and, the, longest, railroad, stone, bridge, it, was, completed, in, 1905, its, arch, which, was, constructed, from, over, 5, 000, tonnes, 4, 900, long, tons, 5, 500, short, tons, of, stone, blocks, in, just, 18, days, is, the, second, largest, stone, arch, in, the, world, surpassed, only, by, the, friedensbr, cke, syratalviadukt, in, plauen, and, the, largest, railroad, stone, arch, the, arch, of, the, friedensbr, cke, which, was, built, in, the, same, year, has, the, span, of, 90, m, 295, ft, and, crosses, the, valley, of, the, syrabach, river, the, difference, between, the, two, is, that, the, solkan, bridge, was, built, from, stone, blocks, whereas, the, friedensbr, cke, was, built, from, a, mixture, of, crushed, stone, and, cement, mortar, the, world, s, largest, arch, bridge, is, the, chaotianmen, bridge, over, the, yangtze, river, with, a, length, of, 1, 741, m, 5, 712, ft, and, a, span, of, 552, m, 1, 811, ft, the, bridge, was, opened, 29, april, 2009, in, chongqing, china, the, longest, suspension, bridge, in, the, world, is, the, 4, 608, m, 15, 118, ft, 1915, anakkale, bridge, in, turkey, the, longest, cable, stayed, bridge, since, 2012, is, the, 1, 104, m, 3, 622, ft, russky, bridge, in, vladivostok, russia, some, engineers, sub, divide, beam, bridges, into, slab, beam, and, slab, and, box, girder, on, the, basis, of, their, cross, section, a, slab, can, be, solid, or, voided, though, this, is, no, longer, favored, for, inspectability, reasons, while, beam, and, slab, consists, of, concrete, or, steel, girders, connected, by, a, concrete, slab, a, box, girder, cross, section, consists, of, a, single, cell, or, multi, cellular, box, in, recent, years, integral, bridge, construction, has, also, become, popular, most, bridges, are, fixed, bridges, meaning, they, have, no, moving, parts, and, stay, in, one, place, until, they, fail, or, are, demolished, temporary, bridges, such, as, bailey, bridges, are, designed, to, be, assembled, taken, apart, transported, to, a, different, site, and, re, used, they, are, important, in, military, engineering, and, are, also, used, to, carry, traffic, while, an, old, bridge, is, being, rebuilt, movable, bridges, are, designed, to, move, out, of, the, way, of, boats, or, other, kinds, of, traffic, which, would, otherwise, be, too, tall, to, fit, these, are, generally, electrically, powered, the, tank, bridge, transporter, tbt, has, the, same, cross, country, performance, as, a, tank, even, when, fully, loaded, it, can, deploy, drop, off, and, load, bridges, independently, but, it, cannot, recover, them, double, decked, or, double, decker, bridges, have, two, levels, such, as, the, george, washington, bridge, connecting, new, york, city, to, bergen, county, new, jersey, us, as, the, world, s, busiest, bridge, carrying, 102, million, vehicles, annually, truss, work, between, the, roadway, levels, provided, stiffness, to, the, roadways, and, reduced, movement, of, the, upper, level, when, the, lower, level, was, installed, three, decades, after, the, upper, level, the, tsing, ma, bridge, and, kap, shui, mun, bridge, in, hong, kong, have, six, lanes, on, their, upper, decks, and, on, their, lower, decks, there, are, two, lanes, and, a, pair, of, tracks, for, mtr, metro, trains, some, double, decked, bridges, only, use, one, level, for, street, traffic, the, washington, avenue, bridge, in, minneapolis, reserves, its, lower, level, for, automobile, and, light, rail, traffic, and, its, upper, level, for, pedestrian, and, bicycle, traffic, predominantly, students, at, the, university, of, minnesota, likewise, in, toronto, the, prince, edward, viaduct, has, five, lanes, of, motor, traffic, bicycle, lanes, and, sidewalks, on, its, upper, deck, and, a, pair, of, tracks, for, the, bloor, danforth, subway, line, on, its, lower, deck, the, western, span, of, the, san, francisco, oakland, bay, bridge, also, has, two, levels, robert, stephenson, s, high, level, bridge, across, the, river, tyne, in, newcastle, upon, tyne, completed, in, 1849, is, an, early, example, of, a, double, decked, bridge, the, upper, level, carries, a, railway, and, the, lower, level, is, used, for, road, traffic, other, examples, include, britannia, bridge, over, the, menai, strait, and, craigavon, bridge, in, derry, northern, ireland, the, oresund, bridge, between, copenhagen, and, malm, consists, of, a, four, lane, highway, on, the, upper, level, and, a, pair, of, railway, tracks, at, the, lower, level, tower, bridge, in, london, is, different, example, of, a, double, decked, bridge, with, the, central, section, consisting, of, a, low, level, bascule, span, and, a, high, level, footbridge, a, viaduct, is, made, up, of, multiple, bridges, connected, into, one, longer, structure, the, longest, and, some, of, the, highest, bridges, are, viaducts, such, as, the, lake, pontchartrain, causeway, and, millau, viaduct, a, multi, way, bridge, has, three, or, more, separate, spans, which, meet, near, the, center, of, the, bridge, multi, way, bridges, with, only, three, spans, appear, as, a, t, or, y, when, viewed, from, above, multi, way, bridges, are, extremely, rare, the, tridge, margaret, bridge, and, zanesville, y, bridge, are, examples, a, bridge, can, be, categorized, by, what, it, is, designed, to, carry, such, as, trains, pedestrian, or, road, traffic, road, bridge, a, pipeline, pipe, bridge, or, waterway, for, water, transport, or, barge, traffic, an, aqueduct, is, a, bridge, that, carries, water, resembling, a, viaduct, which, is, a, bridge, that, connects, points, of, equal, height, a, road, rail, bridge, carries, both, road, and, rail, traffic, overway, is, a, term, for, a, bridge, that, separates, incompatible, intersecting, traffic, especially, road, and, rail, some, bridges, accommodate, other, purposes, such, as, the, tower, of, nov, most, bridge, in, bratislava, which, features, a, restaurant, or, a, bridge, restaurant, which, is, a, bridge, built, to, serve, as, a, restaurant, other, suspension, bridge, towers, carry, transmission, antennas, conservationists, use, wildlife, overpasses, to, reduce, habitat, fragmentation, and, animal, vehicle, collisions, the, first, animal, bridges, sprung, up, in, france, in, the, 1950s, and, these, types, of, bridges, are, now, used, worldwide, to, protect, both, large, and, small, wildlife, bridges, are, subject, to, unplanned, uses, as, well, the, areas, underneath, some, bridges, have, become, makeshift, shelters, and, homes, to, homeless, people, and, the, undertimbers, of, bridges, all, around, the, world, are, spots, of, prevalent, graffiti, some, bridges, attract, people, attempting, suicide, and, become, known, as, suicide, bridges, the, materials, used, to, build, the, structure, are, also, used, to, categorize, bridges, until, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, bridges, were, made, out, of, timber, stone, and, masonry, modern, bridges, are, currently, built, in, concrete, steel, fiber, reinforced, polymers, frp, stainless, steel, or, combinations, of, those, materials, living, bridges, have, been, constructed, of, live, plants, such, as, ficus, elastica, tree, roots, in, india, and, wisteria, vines, in, japan, unlike, buildings, whose, design, is, led, by, architects, bridges, are, usually, designed, by, engineers, this, follows, from, the, importance, of, the, engineering, requirements, namely, spanning, the, obstacle, and, having, the, durability, to, survive, with, minimal, maintenance, in, an, aggressive, outdoor, environment, bridges, are, first, analysed, the, bending, moment, and, shear, force, distributions, are, calculated, due, to, the, applied, loads, for, this, the, finite, element, method, is, the, most, popular, the, analysis, can, be, one, two, or, three, dimensional, for, the, majority, of, bridges, a, two, dimensional, plate, model, often, with, stiffening, beams, is, sufficient, or, an, upstand, finite, element, model, on, completion, of, the, analysis, the, bridge, is, designed, to, resist, the, applied, bending, moments, and, shear, forces, section, sizes, are, selected, with, sufficient, capacity, to, resist, the, stresses, many, bridges, are, made, of, prestressed, concrete, which, has, good, durability, properties, either, by, pre, tensioning, of, beams, prior, to, installation, or, post, tensioning, on, site, in, most, countries, bridges, like, other, structures, are, designed, according, to, load, and, resistance, factor, design, lrfd, principles, in, simple, terms, this, means, that, the, load, is, factored, up, by, a, factor, greater, than, unity, while, the, resistance, or, capacity, of, the, structure, is, factored, down, by, a, factor, less, than, unity, the, effect, of, the, factored, load, stress, bending, moment, should, be, less, than, the, factored, resistance, to, that, effect, both, of, these, factors, allow, for, uncertainty, and, are, greater, when, the, uncertainty, is, greater, most, bridges, are, utilitarian, in, appearance, but, in, some, cases, the, appearance, of, the, bridge, can, have, great, importance, often, this, is, the, case, with, a, large, bridge, that, serves, as, an, entrance, to, a, city, or, crosses, over, a, main, harbor, entrance, these, are, sometimes, known, as, signature, bridges, designers, of, bridges, in, parks, and, along, parkways, often, place, more, importance, on, aesthetics, as, well, examples, include, the, stone, faced, bridges, along, the, taconic, state, parkway, in, new, york, bridges, are, typically, more, aesthetically, pleasing, if, they, are, simple, in, shape, the, deck, is, thinner, in, proportion, to, its, span, the, lines, of, the, structure, are, continuous, and, the, shapes, of, the, structural, elements, reflect, the, forces, acting, on, them, to, create, a, beautiful, image, some, bridges, are, built, much, taller, than, necessary, this, type, often, found, in, east, asian, style, gardens, is, called, a, moon, bridge, evoking, a, rising, full, moon, other, garden, bridges, may, cross, only, a, dry, bed, of, stream, washed, pebbles, intended, only, to, convey, an, impression, of, a, stream, often, in, palaces, a, bridge, will, be, built, over, an, artificial, waterway, as, symbolic, of, a, passage, to, an, important, place, or, state, of, mind, a, set, of, five, bridges, cross, a, sinuous, waterway, in, an, important, courtyard, of, the, forbidden, city, in, beijing, china, the, central, bridge, was, reserved, exclusively, for, the, use, of, the, emperor, and, empress, with, their, attendants, the, estimated, life, of, bridges, varies, between, 25, and, 80, years, depending, on, location, and, material, bridges, may, age, hundred, years, with, proper, maintenance, and, rehabilitation, bridge, maintenance, consisting, of, a, combination, of, structural, health, monitoring, and, testing, this, is, regulated, in, country, specific, engineer, standards, and, includes, an, ongoing, monitoring, every, three, to, six, months, a, simple, test, or, inspection, every, two, to, three, years, and, a, major, inspection, every, six, to, ten, years, in, europe, the, cost, of, maintenance, is, considerable, and, is, higher, in, some, countries, than, spending, on, new, bridges, the, lifetime, of, welded, steel, bridges, can, be, significantly, extended, by, aftertreatment, of, the, weld, transitions, this, results, in, a, potential, high, benefit, using, existing, bridges, far, beyond, the, planned, lifetime, while, the, response, of, a, bridge, to, the, applied, loading, is, well, understood, the, applied, traffic, loading, itself, is, still, the, subject, of, research, this, is, a, statistical, problem, as, loading, is, highly, variable, particularly, for, road, bridges, load, effects, in, bridges, stresses, bending, moments, are, designed, for, using, the, principles, of, load, and, resistance, factor, design, before, factoring, to, allow, for, uncertainty, the, load, effect, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, maximum, characteristic, value, in, a, specified, return, period, notably, in, europe, it, is, the, maximum, value, expected, in, 1000, years, bridge, standards, generally, include, a, load, model, deemed, to, represent, the, characteristic, maximum, load, to, be, expected, in, the, return, period, in, the, past, these, load, models, were, agreed, by, standard, drafting, committees, of, experts, but, today, this, situation, is, changing, it, is, now, possible, to, measure, the, components, of, bridge, traffic, load, to, weigh, trucks, using, weigh, in, motion, wim, technologies, with, extensive, wim, databases, it, is, possible, to, calculate, the, maximum, expected, load, effect, in, the, specified, return, period, this, is, an, active, area, of, research, addressing, issues, of, opposing, direction, lanes, side, by, side, same, direction, lanes, traffic, growth, permit, non, permit, vehicles, and, long, span, bridges, see, below, rather, than, repeat, this, complex, process, every, time, a, bridge, is, to, be, designed, standards, authorities, specify, simplified, notional, load, models, notably, hl, 93, intended, to, give, the, same, load, effects, as, the, characteristic, maximum, values, the, eurocode, is, an, example, of, a, standard, for, bridge, traffic, loading, that, was, developed, in, this, way, most, bridge, standards, are, only, applicable, for, short, and, medium, spans, for, example, the, eurocode, is, only, applicable, for, loaded, lengths, up, to, 200, m, longer, spans, are, dealt, with, on, a, case, by, case, basis, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, intensity, of, load, reduces, as, span, increases, because, the, probability, of, many, trucks, being, closely, spaced, and, extremely, heavy, reduces, as, the, number, of, trucks, involved, increases, it, is, also, generally, assumed, that, short, spans, are, governed, by, a, small, number, of, trucks, traveling, at, high, speed, with, an, allowance, for, dynamics, longer, spans, on, the, other, hand, are, governed, by, congested, traffic, and, no, allowance, for, dynamics, is, needed, calculating, the, loading, due, to, congested, traffic, remains, a, challenge, as, there, is, a, paucity, of, data, on, inter, vehicle, gaps, both, within, lane, and, inter, lane, in, congested, conditions, weigh, in, motion, wim, systems, provide, data, on, inter, vehicle, gaps, but, only, operate, well, in, free, flowing, traffic, conditions, some, authors, have, used, cameras, to, measure, gaps, and, vehicle, lengths, in, jammed, situations, and, have, inferred, weights, from, lengths, using, wim, data, others, have, used, microsimulation, to, generate, typical, clusters, of, vehicles, on, the, bridge, bridges, vibrate, under, load, and, this, contributes, to, a, greater, or, lesser, extent, to, the, stresses, vibration, and, dynamics, are, generally, more, significant, for, slender, structures, such, as, pedestrian, bridges, and, long, span, road, or, rail, bridges, one, of, the, most, famous, examples, is, the, tacoma, narrows, bridge, that, collapsed, shortly, after, being, constructed, due, to, excessive, vibration, more, recently, the, millennium, bridge, in, london, vibrated, excessively, under, pedestrian, loading, and, was, closed, and, retrofitted, with, a, system, of, dampers, for, smaller, bridges, dynamics, is, not, catastrophic, but, can, contribute, an, added, amplification, to, the, stresses, due, to, static, effects, for, example, the, eurocode, for, bridge, loading, specifies, amplifications, of, between, 10, and, 70, depending, on, the, span, the, number, of, traffic, lanes, and, the, type, of, stress, bending, moment, or, shear, force, there, have, been, many, studies, of, the, dynamic, interaction, between, vehicles, and, bridges, during, vehicle, crossing, events, fryba, did, pioneering, work, on, the, interaction, of, a, moving, load, and, an, euler, bernoulli, beam, with, increased, computing, power, vehicle, bridge, interaction, vbi, models, have, become, ever, more, sophisticated, the, concern, is, that, one, of, the, many, natural, frequencies, associated, with, the, vehicle, will, resonate, with, the, bridge, s, first, natural, frequency, the, vehicle, related, frequencies, include, body, bounce, and, axle, hop, but, there, are, also, pseudo, frequencies, associated, with, the, vehicle, s, speed, of, crossing, and, there, are, many, frequencies, associated, with, the, surface, profile, given, the, wide, variety, of, heavy, vehicles, on, road, bridges, a, statistical, approach, has, been, suggested, with, vbi, analyses, carried, out, for, many, statically, extreme, loading, events, the, failure, of, bridges, is, of, special, concern, for, structural, engineers, in, trying, to, learn, lessons, vital, to, bridge, design, construction, and, maintenance, the, failure, of, bridges, first, assumed, national, interest, in, britain, during, the, victorian, era, when, many, new, designs, were, being, built, often, using, new, materials, with, some, of, them, failing, catastrophically, in, the, united, states, the, national, bridge, inventory, tracks, the, structural, evaluations, of, all, bridges, including, designations, such, as, structurally, deficient, and, functionally, obsolete, there, are, several, methods, used, to, monitor, the, condition, of, large, structures, like, bridges, many, long, span, bridges, are, now, routinely, monitored, with, a, range, of, sensors, including, strain, transducers, accelerometers, tiltmeters, and, gps, accelerometers, have, the, advantage, that, they, are, inertial, i, e, they, do, not, require, a, reference, point, to, measure, from, this, is, often, a, problem, for, distance, or, deflection, measurement, especially, if, the, bridge, is, over, water, crowdsourcing, bridge, conditions, by, accessing, data, passively, captured, by, cell, phones, which, routinely, include, accelerometers, and, gps, sensors, has, been, suggested, as, an, alternative, to, including, sensors, during, bridge, construction, and, an, augment, for, professional, examinations, an, option, for, structural, integrity, monitoring, is, non, contact, monitoring, which, uses, the, doppler, effect, doppler, shift, a, laser, beam, from, a, laser, doppler, vibrometer, is, directed, at, the, point, of, interest, and, the, vibration, amplitude, and, frequency, are, extracted, from, the, doppler, shift, of, the, laser, beam, frequency, due, to, the, motion, of, the, surface, the, advantage, of, this, method, is, that, the, setup, time, for, the, equipment, is, faster, and, unlike, an, accelerometer, this, makes, measurements, possible, on, multiple, structures, in, as, short, a, time, as, possible, additionally, this, method, can, measure, specific, points, on, a, bridge, that, might, be, difficult, to, access, however, vibrometers, are, relatively, expensive, and, have, the, disadvantage, that, a, reference, point, is, needed, to, measure, from, snapshots, in, time, of, the, external, condition, of, a, bridge, can, be, recorded, using, lidar, to, aid, bridge, inspection, this, can, provide, measurement, of, the, bridge, geometry, to, facilitate, the, building, of, a, computer, model, but, the, accuracy, is, generally, insufficient, to, measure, bridge, deflections, under, load, while, larger, modern, bridges, are, routinely, monitored, electronically, smaller, bridges, are, generally, inspected, visually, by, trained, inspectors, there, is, considerable, research, interest, in, the, challenge, of, smaller, bridges, as, they, are, often, remote, and, do, not, have, electrical, power, on, site, possible, solutions, are, the, installation, of, sensors, on, a, specialist, inspection, vehicle, and, the, use, of, its, measurements, as, it, drives, over, the, bridge, to, infer, information, about, the, bridge, condition, these, vehicles, can, be, equipped, with, accelerometers, gyrometers, laser, doppler, vibrometers, and, some, even, have, the, capability, to, apply, a, resonant, force, to, the, road, surface, to, dynamically, excite, the, bridge, at, its, resonant, frequency
