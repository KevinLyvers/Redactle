a, cooling, tower, is, a, device, that, rejects, waste, heat, to, the, atmosphere, through, the, cooling, of, a, coolant, stream, usually, a, water, stream, to, a, lower, temperature, cooling, towers, may, either, use, the, evaporation, of, water, to, remove, heat, and, cool, the, working, fluid, to, near, the, wet, bulb, air, temperature, or, in, the, case, of, dry, cooling, towers, rely, solely, on, air, to, cool, the, working, fluid, to, near, the, dry, bulb, air, temperature, using, radiators, common, applications, include, cooling, the, circulating, water, used, in, oil, refineries, petrochemical, and, other, chemical, plants, thermal, power, stations, nuclear, power, stations, and, hvac, systems, for, cooling, buildings, the, classification, is, based, on, the, type, of, air, induction, into, the, tower, the, main, types, of, cooling, towers, are, natural, draft, and, induced, draft, cooling, towers, cooling, towers, vary, in, size, from, small, roof, top, units, to, very, large, hyperboloid, structures, that, can, be, up, to, 200, metres, 660, ft, tall, and, 100, metres, 330, ft, in, diameter, or, rectangular, structures, that, can, be, over, 40, metres, 130, ft, tall, and, 80, metres, 260, ft, long, hyperboloid, cooling, towers, are, often, associated, with, nuclear, power, plants, although, they, are, also, used, in, many, coal, fired, plants, and, to, some, extent, in, some, large, chemical, and, other, industrial, plants, the, steam, turbine, is, what, necessitates, the, cooling, tower, although, these, large, towers, are, very, prominent, the, vast, majority, of, cooling, towers, are, much, smaller, including, many, units, installed, on, or, near, buildings, to, discharge, heat, from, air, conditioning, cooling, towers, are, also, often, thought, to, emit, smoke, or, harmful, fumes, by, the, general, public, when, in, reality, the, emissions, from, those, towers, mostly, do, not, contribute, to, carbon, footprint, and, consist, solely, of, water, vapor, cooling, towers, originated, in, the, 19th, century, through, the, development, of, condensers, for, use, with, the, steam, engine, condensers, use, relatively, cool, water, via, various, means, to, condense, the, steam, coming, out, of, the, cylinders, or, turbines, this, reduces, the, back, pressure, which, in, turn, reduces, the, steam, consumption, and, thus, the, fuel, consumption, while, at, the, same, time, increasing, power, and, recycling, boiler, water, however, the, condensers, require, an, ample, supply, of, cooling, water, without, which, they, are, impractical, while, water, usage, is, not, an, issue, with, marine, engines, it, forms, a, significant, limitation, for, many, land, based, systems, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, several, evaporative, methods, of, recycling, cooling, water, were, in, use, in, areas, lacking, an, established, water, supply, as, well, as, in, urban, locations, where, municipal, water, mains, may, not, be, of, sufficient, supply, reliable, in, times, of, demand, or, otherwise, adequate, to, meet, cooling, needs, in, areas, with, available, land, the, systems, took, the, form, of, cooling, ponds, in, areas, with, limited, land, such, as, in, cities, they, took, the, form, of, cooling, towers, these, early, towers, were, positioned, either, on, the, rooftops, of, buildings, or, as, free, standing, structures, supplied, with, air, by, fans, or, relying, on, natural, airflow, an, american, engineering, textbook, from, 1911, described, one, design, as, a, circular, or, rectangular, shell, of, light, plate, in, effect, a, chimney, stack, much, shortened, vertically, 20, to, 40, ft, high, and, very, much, enlarged, laterally, at, the, top, is, a, set, of, distributing, troughs, to, which, the, water, from, the, condenser, must, be, pumped, from, these, it, trickles, down, over, mats, made, of, wooden, slats, or, woven, wire, screens, which, fill, the, space, within, the, tower, a, hyperboloid, cooling, tower, was, patented, by, the, dutch, engineers, frederik, van, iterson, and, gerard, kuypers, in, the, netherlands, on, august, 16, 1916, the, first, hyperboloid, reinforced, concrete, cooling, towers, were, built, by, the, dutch, state, mine, dsm, emma, in, 1918, in, heerlen, the, first, ones, in, the, united, kingdom, were, built, in, 1924, at, lister, drive, power, station, in, liverpool, england, on, both, locations, they, were, built, to, cool, water, used, at, a, coal, fired, electrical, power, station, according, to, gas, technology, institute, gti, report, the, indirect, dew, point, evaporative, cooling, maisotsenko, cycle, m, cycle, is, a, theoretically, sound, method, of, reducing, a, fluid, to, dew, point, temperature, which, is, lower, than, its, wet, bulb, temperature, the, m, cycle, utilizes, the, psychrometric, energy, or, the, potential, energy, available, from, the, latent, heat, of, water, evaporating, into, the, air, while, its, current, manifestation, is, as, the, m, cycle, hmx, for, air, conditioning, through, engineering, design, this, cycle, could, be, applied, as, a, heat, and, moisture, recovery, device, for, combustion, devices, cooling, towers, condensers, and, other, processes, involving, humid, gas, streams, the, consumption, of, cooling, water, by, inland, processing, and, power, plants, is, estimated, to, reduce, power, availability, for, the, majority, of, thermal, power, plants, by, 2040, 2069, in, 2021, researchers, presented, a, method, for, steam, recapture, the, steam, is, charged, using, an, ion, beam, and, then, captured, in, a, wire, mesh, of, opposite, charge, the, water, s, purity, exceeded, epa, potability, standards, an, hvac, heating, ventilating, and, air, conditioning, cooling, tower, is, used, to, dispose, of, reject, unwanted, heat, from, a, chiller, liquid, cooled, chillers, are, normally, more, energy, efficient, than, air, cooled, chillers, due, to, heat, rejection, to, tower, water, at, or, near, wet, bulb, temperatures, air, cooled, chillers, must, reject, heat, at, the, higher, dry, bulb, temperature, and, thus, have, a, lower, average, reverse, carnot, cycle, effectiveness, in, areas, with, a, hot, climate, large, office, buildings, hospitals, and, schools, typically, use, one, or, more, cooling, towers, as, part, of, their, air, conditioning, systems, generally, industrial, cooling, towers, are, much, larger, than, hvac, towers, hvac, use, of, a, cooling, tower, pairs, the, cooling, tower, with, a, liquid, cooled, chiller, or, liquid, cooled, condenser, a, ton, of, air, conditioning, is, defined, as, the, removal, of, 12, 000, british, thermal, units, per, hour, 3, 5, kw, the, equivalent, ton, on, the, cooling, tower, side, actually, rejects, about, 15, 000, british, thermal, units, per, hour, 4, 4, kw, due, to, the, additional, waste, heat, equivalent, of, the, energy, needed, to, drive, the, chiller, s, compressor, this, equivalent, ton, is, defined, as, the, heat, rejection, in, cooling, 3, us, gallons, per, minute, 11, litres, per, minute, or, 1, 500, pounds, per, hour, 680, kg, h, of, water, by, 10, f, 5, 6, c, which, amounts, to, 15, 000, british, thermal, units, per, hour, 4, 4, kw, assuming, a, chiller, coefficient, of, performance, cop, of, 4, 0, this, cop, is, equivalent, to, an, energy, efficiency, ratio, eer, of, 14, cooling, towers, are, also, used, in, hvac, systems, that, have, multiple, water, source, heat, pumps, that, share, a, common, piping, water, loop, in, this, type, of, system, the, water, circulating, inside, the, water, loop, removes, heat, from, the, condenser, of, the, heat, pumps, whenever, the, heat, pumps, are, working, in, the, cooling, mode, then, the, externally, mounted, cooling, tower, is, used, to, remove, heat, from, the, water, loop, and, reject, it, to, the, atmosphere, by, contrast, when, the, heat, pumps, are, working, in, heating, mode, the, condensers, draw, heat, out, of, the, loop, water, and, reject, it, into, the, space, to, be, heated, when, the, water, loop, is, being, used, primarily, to, supply, heat, to, the, building, the, cooling, tower, is, normally, shut, down, and, may, be, drained, or, winterized, to, prevent, freeze, damage, and, heat, is, supplied, by, other, means, usually, from, separate, boilers, industrial, cooling, towers, can, be, used, to, remove, heat, from, various, sources, such, as, machinery, or, heated, process, material, the, primary, use, of, large, industrial, cooling, towers, is, to, remove, the, heat, absorbed, in, the, circulating, cooling, water, systems, used, in, power, plants, petroleum, refineries, petrochemical, plants, natural, gas, processing, plants, food, processing, plants, semi, conductor, plants, and, for, other, industrial, facilities, such, as, in, condensers, of, distillation, columns, for, cooling, liquid, in, crystallization, etc, the, circulation, rate, of, cooling, water, in, a, typical, 700, mw, th, coal, fired, power, plant, with, a, cooling, tower, amounts, to, about, 71, 600, cubic, metres, an, hour, 315, 000, us, gallons, per, minute, and, the, circulating, water, requires, a, supply, water, make, up, rate, of, perhaps, 5, percent, i, e, 3, 600, cubic, metres, an, hour, equivalent, to, one, cubic, metre, every, second, if, that, same, plant, had, no, cooling, tower, and, used, once, through, cooling, water, it, would, require, about, 100, 000, cubic, metres, an, hour, a, large, cooling, water, intake, typically, kills, millions, of, fish, and, larvae, annually, as, the, organisms, are, impinged, on, the, intake, screens, a, large, amount, of, water, would, have, to, be, continuously, returned, to, the, ocean, lake, or, river, from, which, it, was, obtained, and, continuously, re, supplied, to, the, plant, furthermore, discharging, large, amounts, of, hot, water, may, raise, the, temperature, of, the, receiving, river, or, lake, to, an, unacceptable, level, for, the, local, ecosystem, elevated, water, temperatures, can, kill, fish, and, other, aquatic, organisms, see, thermal, pollution, or, can, also, cause, an, increase, in, undesirable, organisms, such, as, invasive, species, of, zebra, mussels, or, algae, a, cooling, tower, serves, to, dissipate, the, heat, into, the, atmosphere, instead, so, that, wind, and, air, diffusion, spreads, the, heat, over, a, much, larger, area, than, hot, water, can, distribute, heat, in, a, body, of, water, evaporative, cooling, water, cannot, be, used, for, subsequent, purposes, other, than, rain, somewhere, whereas, surface, only, cooling, water, can, be, re, used, some, coal, fired, and, nuclear, power, plants, located, in, coastal, areas, do, make, use, of, once, through, ocean, water, but, even, there, the, offshore, discharge, water, outlet, requires, very, careful, design, to, avoid, environmental, problems, petroleum, refineries, may, also, have, very, large, cooling, tower, systems, a, typical, large, refinery, processing, 40, 000, metric, tonnes, of, crude, oil, per, day, 300, 000, barrels, 48, 000, m, 3, per, day, circulates, about, 80, 000, cubic, metres, of, water, per, hour, through, its, cooling, tower, system, the, world, s, tallest, cooling, tower, is, the, 210, metres, 690, ft, tall, cooling, tower, of, the, pingshan, ii, power, station, in, huaibei, anhui, province, china, these, types, of, cooling, towers, are, factory, preassembled, and, can, be, simply, transported, on, trucks, as, they, are, compact, machines, the, capacity, of, package, type, towers, is, limited, and, for, that, reason, they, are, usually, preferred, by, facilities, with, low, heat, rejection, requirements, such, as, food, processing, plants, textile, plants, some, chemical, processing, plants, or, buildings, like, hospitals, hotels, malls, automotive, factories, etc, due, to, their, frequent, use, in, or, near, residential, areas, sound, level, control, is, a, relatively, more, important, issue, for, package, type, cooling, towers, facilities, such, as, power, plants, steel, processing, plants, petroleum, refineries, or, petrochemical, plants, usually, install, field, erected, type, cooling, towers, due, to, their, greater, capacity, for, heat, rejection, field, erected, towers, are, usually, much, larger, in, size, compared, to, the, package, type, cooling, towers, a, typical, field, erected, cooling, tower, has, a, pultruded, fiber, reinforced, plastic, frp, structure, frp, cladding, a, mechanical, unit, for, air, draft, and, a, drift, eliminator, with, respect, to, the, heat, transfer, mechanism, employed, the, main, types, are, in, a, wet, cooling, tower, or, open, circuit, cooling, tower, the, warm, water, can, be, cooled, to, a, temperature, lower, than, the, ambient, air, dry, bulb, temperature, if, the, air, is, relatively, dry, see, dew, point, and, psychrometrics, as, ambient, air, is, drawn, past, a, flow, of, water, a, small, portion, of, the, water, evaporates, and, the, energy, required, to, evaporate, that, portion, of, the, water, is, taken, from, the, remaining, mass, of, water, thus, reducing, its, temperature, approximately, 2, 300, kilojoules, per, kilogram, 970, btu, lb, of, heat, energy, is, absorbed, for, the, evaporated, water, evaporation, results, in, saturated, air, conditions, lowering, the, temperature, of, the, water, processed, by, the, tower, to, a, value, close, to, wet, bulb, temperature, which, is, lower, than, the, ambient, dry, bulb, temperature, the, difference, determined, by, the, initial, humidity, of, the, ambient, air, to, achieve, better, performance, more, cooling, a, medium, called, fill, is, used, to, increase, the, surface, area, and, the, time, of, contact, between, the, air, and, water, flows, splash, fill, consists, of, material, placed, to, interrupt, the, water, flow, causing, splashing, film, fill, is, composed, of, thin, sheets, of, material, usually, pvc, upon, which, the, water, flows, both, methods, create, increased, surface, area, and, time, of, contact, between, the, fluid, water, and, the, gas, air, to, improve, heat, transfer, with, respect, to, drawing, air, through, the, tower, there, are, three, types, of, cooling, towers, on, 16, august, 1916, frederik, van, iterson, took, out, the, uk, patent, 108, 863, for, improved, construction, of, cooling, towers, of, reinforced, concrete, the, patent, was, filed, on, 9, august, 1917, and, published, on, 11, april, 1918, in, 1918, dsm, built, the, first, hyperboloid, natural, draft, cooling, tower, at, the, staatsmijn, emma, to, his, design, hyperboloid, sometimes, incorrectly, known, as, hyperbolic, cooling, towers, have, become, the, design, standard, for, all, natural, draft, cooling, towers, because, of, their, structural, strength, and, minimum, usage, of, material, the, hyperboloid, shape, also, aids, in, accelerating, the, upward, convective, air, flow, improving, cooling, efficiency, these, designs, are, popularly, associated, with, nuclear, power, plants, however, this, association, is, misleading, as, the, same, kind, of, cooling, towers, are, often, used, at, large, coal, fired, power, plants, and, some, geothermal, plants, as, well, the, steam, turbine, is, what, necessitates, the, cooling, tower, conversely, not, all, nuclear, power, plants, have, cooling, towers, and, some, instead, cool, their, working, fluid, with, lake, river, or, ocean, water, typically, lower, initial, and, long, term, cost, mostly, due, to, pump, requirements, crossflow, is, a, design, in, which, the, airflow, is, directed, perpendicular, to, the, water, flow, see, diagram, at, left, airflow, enters, one, or, more, vertical, faces, of, the, cooling, tower, to, meet, the, fill, material, water, flows, perpendicular, to, the, air, through, the, fill, by, gravity, the, air, continues, through, the, fill, and, thus, past, the, water, flow, into, an, open, plenum, volume, lastly, a, fan, forces, the, air, out, into, the, atmosphere, a, distribution, or, hot, water, basin, consisting, of, a, deep, pan, with, holes, or, nozzles, in, its, bottom, is, located, near, the, top, of, a, crossflow, tower, gravity, distributes, the, water, through, the, nozzles, uniformly, across, the, fill, material, cross, flow, v, s, counter, flow, advantages, of, the, crossflow, design, disadvantages, of, the, crossflow, design, in, a, counterflow, design, the, air, flow, is, directly, opposite, to, the, water, flow, see, diagram, at, left, air, flow, first, enters, an, open, area, beneath, the, fill, media, and, is, then, drawn, up, vertically, the, water, is, sprayed, through, pressurized, nozzles, near, the, top, of, the, tower, and, then, flows, downward, through, the, fill, opposite, to, the, air, flow, advantages, of, the, counterflow, design, disadvantages, of, the, counterflow, design, common, aspects, of, both, designs, both, crossflow, and, counterflow, designs, can, be, used, in, natural, draft, and, in, mechanical, draft, cooling, towers, quantitatively, the, material, balance, around, a, wet, evaporative, cooling, tower, system, is, governed, by, the, operational, variables, of, make, up, volumetric, flow, rate, evaporation, and, windage, losses, draw, off, rate, and, the, concentration, cycles, in, the, adjacent, diagram, water, pumped, from, the, tower, basin, is, the, cooling, water, routed, through, the, process, coolers, and, condensers, in, an, industrial, facility, the, cool, water, absorbs, heat, from, the, hot, process, streams, which, need, to, be, cooled, or, condensed, and, the, absorbed, heat, warms, the, circulating, water, c, the, warm, water, returns, to, the, top, of, the, cooling, tower, and, trickles, downward, over, the, fill, material, inside, the, tower, as, it, trickles, down, it, contacts, ambient, air, rising, up, through, the, tower, either, by, natural, draft, or, by, forced, draft, using, large, fans, in, the, tower, that, contact, causes, a, small, amount, of, the, water, to, be, lost, as, windage, or, drift, w, and, some, of, the, water, e, to, evaporate, the, heat, required, to, evaporate, the, water, is, derived, from, the, water, itself, which, cools, the, water, back, to, the, original, basin, water, temperature, and, the, water, is, then, ready, to, recirculate, the, evaporated, water, leaves, its, dissolved, salts, behind, in, the, bulk, of, the, water, which, has, not, been, evaporated, thus, raising, the, salt, concentration, in, the, circulating, cooling, water, to, prevent, the, salt, concentration, of, the, water, from, becoming, too, high, a, portion, of, the, water, is, drawn, off, or, blown, down, d, for, disposal, fresh, water, make, up, m, is, supplied, to, the, tower, basin, to, compensate, for, the, loss, of, evaporated, water, the, windage, loss, water, and, the, draw, off, water, using, these, flow, rates, and, concentration, dimensional, units, a, water, balance, around, the, entire, system, is, then, since, the, evaporated, water, e, has, no, salts, a, chloride, balance, around, the, system, is, and, therefore, from, a, simplified, heat, balance, around, the, cooling, tower, windage, or, drift, losses, w, is, the, amount, of, total, tower, water, flow, that, is, entrained, in, the, flow, of, air, to, the, atmosphere, from, large, scale, industrial, cooling, towers, in, the, absence, of, manufacturer, s, data, it, may, be, assumed, to, be, cycle, of, concentration, represents, the, accumulation, of, dissolved, minerals, in, the, recirculating, cooling, water, discharge, of, draw, off, or, blowdown, is, used, principally, to, control, the, buildup, of, these, minerals, the, chemistry, of, the, make, up, water, including, the, amount, of, dissolved, minerals, can, vary, widely, make, up, waters, low, in, dissolved, minerals, such, as, those, from, surface, water, supplies, lakes, rivers, etc, tend, to, be, aggressive, to, metals, corrosive, make, up, waters, from, ground, water, supplies, such, as, wells, are, usually, higher, in, minerals, and, tend, to, be, scaling, deposit, minerals, increasing, the, amount, of, minerals, present, in, the, water, by, cycling, can, make, water, less, aggressive, to, piping, however, excessive, levels, of, minerals, can, cause, scaling, problems, as, the, cycles, of, concentration, increase, the, water, may, not, be, able, to, hold, the, minerals, in, solution, when, the, solubility, of, these, minerals, have, been, exceeded, they, can, precipitate, out, as, mineral, solids, and, cause, fouling, and, heat, exchange, problems, in, the, cooling, tower, or, the, heat, exchangers, the, temperatures, of, the, recirculating, water, piping, and, heat, exchange, surfaces, determine, if, and, where, minerals, will, precipitate, from, the, recirculating, water, often, a, professional, water, treatment, consultant, will, evaluate, the, make, up, water, and, the, operating, conditions, of, the, cooling, tower, and, recommend, an, appropriate, range, for, the, cycles, of, concentration, the, use, of, water, treatment, chemicals, pretreatment, such, as, water, softening, ph, adjustment, and, other, techniques, can, affect, the, acceptable, range, of, cycles, of, concentration, concentration, cycles, in, the, majority, of, cooling, towers, usually, range, from, 3, to, 7, in, the, united, states, many, water, supplies, use, well, water, which, has, significant, levels, of, dissolved, solids, on, the, other, hand, one, of, the, largest, water, supplies, for, new, york, city, has, a, surface, rainwater, source, quite, low, in, minerals, thus, cooling, towers, in, that, city, are, often, allowed, to, concentrate, to, 7, or, more, cycles, of, concentration, since, higher, cycles, of, concentration, represent, less, make, up, water, water, conservation, efforts, may, focus, on, increasing, cycles, of, concentration, highly, treated, recycled, water, may, be, an, effective, means, of, reducing, cooling, tower, consumption, of, potable, water, in, regions, where, potable, water, is, scarce, clean, visible, dirt, debris, from, the, cold, water, basin, and, surfaces, with, any, visible, biofilm, i, e, slime, disinfectant, and, other, chemical, levels, in, cooling, towers, and, hot, tubs, should, be, continuously, maintained, and, regularly, monitored, regular, checks, of, water, quality, specifically, the, aerobic, bacteria, levels, using, dipslides, should, be, taken, as, the, presence, of, other, organisms, can, support, legionella, by, producing, the, organic, nutrients, that, it, needs, to, thrive, besides, treating, the, circulating, cooling, water, in, large, industrial, cooling, tower, systems, to, minimize, scaling, and, fouling, the, water, should, be, filtered, to, remove, particulates, and, also, be, dosed, with, biocides, and, algaecides, to, prevent, growths, that, could, interfere, with, the, continuous, flow, of, the, water, under, certain, conditions, a, biofilm, of, micro, organisms, such, as, bacteria, fungi, and, algae, can, grow, very, rapidly, in, the, cooling, water, and, can, reduce, the, heat, transfer, efficiency, of, the, cooling, tower, biofilm, can, be, reduced, or, prevented, by, using, sodium, chlorite, or, other, chlorine, based, chemicals, a, normal, industrial, practice, is, to, use, two, biocides, such, as, oxidizing, and, non, oxidizing, types, to, complement, each, other, s, strengths, and, weaknesses, and, to, ensure, a, broader, spectrum, of, attack, in, most, cases, a, continual, low, level, oxidizing, biocide, is, used, then, alternating, to, a, periodic, shock, dose, of, non, oxidizing, biocides, algaecides, as, their, name, might, suggest, is, intended, to, kill, algae, and, other, related, plant, like, microbes, in, the, water, biocides, can, reduce, other, living, matter, that, remains, improving, the, system, and, keeping, clean, and, efficient, water, usage, in, a, cooling, tower, one, of, the, most, common, options, when, it, comes, to, biocides, for, your, water, is, bromine, among, the, issues, that, cause, the, most, damage, and, strain, to, a, water, tower, s, systems, is, scaling, when, an, unwanted, material, or, contaminant, in, the, water, builds, up, in, a, certain, area, it, can, create, deposits, that, grow, over, time, this, can, cause, issues, ranging, from, the, narrowing, of, pipes, to, total, blockages, and, equipment, failures, the, water, consumption, of, the, cooling, tower, comes, from, drift, bleed, off, evaporation, loss, the, water, that, is, immediately, replenished, into, the, cooling, tower, due, to, loss, is, called, make, up, water, the, function, of, make, up, water, is, to, make, machinery, and, equipment, run, safely, and, stably, another, very, important, reason, for, using, biocides, in, cooling, towers, is, to, prevent, the, growth, of, legionella, including, species, that, cause, legionellosis, or, legionnaires, disease, most, notably, l, pneumophila, or, mycobacterium, avium, the, various, legionella, species, are, the, cause, of, legionnaires, disease, in, humans, and, transmission, is, via, exposure, to, aerosols, the, inhalation, of, mist, droplets, containing, the, bacteria, common, sources, of, legionella, include, cooling, towers, used, in, open, recirculating, evaporative, cooling, water, systems, domestic, hot, water, systems, fountains, and, similar, disseminators, that, tap, into, a, public, water, supply, natural, sources, include, freshwater, ponds, and, creeks, french, researchers, found, that, legionella, bacteria, travelled, up, to, 6, kilometres, 3, 7, mi, through, the, air, from, a, large, contaminated, cooling, tower, at, a, petrochemical, plant, in, pas, de, calais, france, that, outbreak, killed, 21, of, the, 86, people, who, had, a, laboratory, confirmed, infection, drift, or, windage, is, the, term, for, water, droplets, of, the, process, flow, allowed, to, escape, in, the, cooling, tower, discharge, drift, eliminators, are, used, in, order, to, hold, drift, rates, typically, to, 0, 001, 0, 005, of, the, circulating, flow, rate, a, typical, drift, eliminator, provides, multiple, directional, changes, of, airflow, to, prevent, the, escape, of, water, droplets, a, well, designed, and, well, fitted, drift, eliminator, can, greatly, reduce, water, loss, and, potential, for, legionella, or, water, treatment, chemical, exposure, also, about, every, six, months, inspect, the, conditions, of, the, drift, eliminators, making, sure, there, are, no, gaps, to, allow, the, free, flow, of, dirt, the, us, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, cdc, does, not, recommend, that, health, care, facilities, regularly, test, for, the, legionella, pneumophila, bacteria, scheduled, microbiologic, monitoring, for, legionella, remains, controversial, because, its, presence, is, not, necessarily, evidence, of, a, potential, for, causing, disease, the, cdc, recommends, aggressive, disinfection, measures, for, cleaning, and, maintaining, devices, known, to, transmit, legionella, but, does, not, recommend, regularly, scheduled, microbiologic, assays, for, the, bacteria, however, scheduled, monitoring, of, potable, water, within, a, hospital, might, be, considered, in, certain, settings, where, persons, are, highly, susceptible, to, illness, and, mortality, from, legionella, infection, e, g, hematopoietic, stem, cell, transplantation, units, or, solid, organ, transplant, units, also, after, an, outbreak, of, legionellosis, health, officials, agree, that, monitoring, is, necessary, to, identify, the, source, and, to, evaluate, the, efficacy, of, biocides, or, other, prevention, measures, studies, have, found, legionella, in, 40, to, 60, of, cooling, towers, under, certain, ambient, conditions, plumes, of, water, vapor, can, be, seen, rising, out, of, the, discharge, from, a, cooling, tower, and, can, be, mistaken, as, smoke, from, a, fire, if, the, outdoor, air, is, at, or, near, saturation, and, the, tower, adds, more, water, to, the, air, saturated, air, with, liquid, water, droplets, can, be, discharged, which, is, seen, as, fog, this, phenomenon, typically, occurs, on, cool, humid, days, but, is, rare, in, many, climates, fog, and, clouds, associated, with, cooling, towers, can, be, described, as, homogenitus, as, with, other, clouds, of, man, made, origin, such, as, contrails, and, ship, tracks, this, phenomenon, can, be, prevented, by, decreasing, the, relative, humidity, of, the, saturated, discharge, air, for, that, purpose, in, hybrid, towers, saturated, discharge, air, is, mixed, with, heated, low, relative, humidity, air, some, air, enters, the, tower, above, drift, eliminator, level, passing, through, heat, exchangers, the, relative, humidity, of, the, dry, air, is, even, more, decreased, instantly, as, being, heated, while, entering, the, tower, the, discharged, mixture, has, a, relatively, lower, relative, humidity, and, the, fog, is, invisible, issues, related, to, applied, meteorology, of, cooling, towers, including, the, assessment, of, the, impact, of, cooling, towers, on, cloud, enhancement, were, considered, in, a, series, of, models, and, experiments, one, of, the, results, by, haman, s, group, indicated, significant, dynamic, influences, of, the, condensation, trails, on, the, surrounding, atmosphere, manifested, in, temperature, and, humidity, disturbances, the, mechanism, of, these, influences, seemed, to, be, associated, either, with, the, airflow, over, the, trail, as, an, obstacle, or, with, vertical, waves, generated, by, the, trail, often, at, a, considerable, altitude, above, it, when, wet, cooling, towers, with, seawater, make, up, are, installed, in, various, industries, located, in, or, near, coastal, areas, the, drift, of, fine, droplets, emitted, from, the, cooling, towers, contain, nearly, 6, sodium, chloride, which, deposits, on, the, nearby, land, areas, this, deposition, of, sodium, salts, on, the, nearby, agriculture, vegetative, lands, can, convert, them, into, sodic, saline, or, sodic, alkaline, soils, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, soil, and, enhance, the, sodicity, of, ground, and, surface, water, the, salt, deposition, problem, from, such, cooling, towers, aggravates, where, national, pollution, control, standards, are, not, imposed, or, not, implemented, to, minimize, the, drift, emissions, from, wet, cooling, towers, using, seawater, make, up, respirable, suspended, particulate, matter, of, less, than, 10, micrometers, m, in, size, can, be, present, in, the, drift, from, cooling, towers, larger, particles, above, 10, m, in, size, are, generally, filtered, out, in, the, nose, and, throat, via, cilia, and, mucus, but, particulate, matter, smaller, than, 10, m, referred, to, as, pm, 10, can, settle, in, the, bronchi, and, lungs, and, cause, health, problems, similarly, particles, smaller, than, 2, 5, m, pm, 2, 5, tend, to, penetrate, into, the, gas, exchange, regions, of, the, lung, and, very, small, particles, less, than, 100, nanometers, may, pass, through, the, lungs, to, affect, other, organs, though, the, total, particulate, emissions, from, wet, cooling, towers, with, fresh, water, make, up, is, much, less, they, contain, more, pm, 10, and, pm, 2, 5, than, the, total, emissions, from, wet, cooling, towers, with, sea, water, make, up, this, is, due, to, lesser, salt, content, in, fresh, water, drift, below, 2, 000, ppm, compared, to, the, salt, content, of, sea, water, drift, 60, 000, ppm, at, some, modern, power, stations, equipped, with, flue, gas, purification, such, as, the, gro, krotzenburg, power, station, and, the, rostock, power, station, the, cooling, tower, is, also, used, as, a, flue, gas, stack, industrial, chimney, thus, saving, the, cost, of, a, separate, chimney, structure, at, plants, without, flue, gas, purification, problems, with, corrosion, may, occur, due, to, reactions, of, raw, flue, gas, with, water, to, form, acids, sometimes, natural, draft, cooling, towers, are, constructed, with, structural, steel, in, place, of, concrete, rcc, when, the, construction, time, of, natural, draft, cooling, tower, is, exceeding, the, construction, time, of, the, rest, of, the, plant, or, the, local, soil, is, of, poor, strength, to, bear, the, heavy, weight, of, rcc, cooling, towers, or, cement, prices, are, higher, at, a, site, to, opt, for, cheaper, natural, draft, cooling, towers, made, of, structural, steel, some, cooling, towers, such, as, smaller, building, air, conditioning, systems, are, shut, down, seasonally, drained, and, winterized, to, prevent, freeze, damage, during, the, winter, other, sites, continuously, operate, cooling, towers, with, 4, c, 39, f, water, leaving, the, tower, basin, heaters, tower, draindown, and, other, freeze, protection, methods, are, often, employed, in, cold, climates, operational, cooling, towers, with, malfunctions, can, freeze, during, very, cold, weather, typically, freezing, starts, at, the, corners, of, a, cooling, tower, with, a, reduced, or, absent, heat, load, severe, freezing, conditions, can, create, growing, volumes, of, ice, resulting, in, increased, structural, loads, which, can, cause, structural, damage, or, collapse, to, prevent, freezing, the, following, procedures, are, used, cooling, towers, constructed, in, whole, or, in, part, of, combustible, materials, can, support, internal, fire, propagation, such, fires, can, become, very, intense, due, to, the, high, surface, volume, ratio, of, the, towers, and, fires, can, be, further, intensified, by, natural, convection, or, fan, assisted, draft, the, resulting, damage, can, be, sufficiently, severe, to, require, the, replacement, of, the, entire, cell, or, tower, structure, for, this, reason, some, codes, and, standards, recommend, that, combustible, cooling, towers, be, provided, with, an, automatic, fire, sprinkler, system, fires, can, propagate, internally, within, the, tower, structure, when, the, cell, is, not, in, operation, such, as, for, maintenance, or, construction, and, even, while, the, tower, is, in, operation, especially, those, of, the, induced, draft, type, because, of, the, existence, of, relatively, dry, areas, within, the, towers, being, very, large, structures, cooling, towers, are, susceptible, to, wind, damage, and, several, spectacular, failures, have, occurred, in, the, past, at, ferrybridge, power, station, on, 1, november, 1965, the, station, was, the, site, of, a, major, structural, failure, when, three, of, the, cooling, towers, collapsed, owing, to, vibrations, in, 85, mph, 137, km, h, winds, although, the, structures, had, been, built, to, withstand, higher, wind, speeds, the, shape, of, the, cooling, towers, caused, westerly, winds, to, be, funneled, into, the, towers, themselves, creating, a, vortex, three, out, of, the, original, eight, cooling, towers, were, destroyed, and, the, remaining, five, were, severely, damaged, the, towers, were, later, rebuilt, and, all, eight, cooling, towers, were, strengthened, to, tolerate, adverse, weather, conditions, building, codes, were, changed, to, include, improved, structural, support, and, wind, tunnel, tests, were, introduced, to, check, tower, structures, and, configuration
