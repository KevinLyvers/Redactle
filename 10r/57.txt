a, supercomputer, is, a, type, of, computer, with, a, high, level, of, performance, as, compared, to, a, general, purpose, computer, the, performance, of, a, supercomputer, is, commonly, measured, in, floating, point, operations, per, second, flops, instead, of, million, instructions, per, second, mips, since, 2017, supercomputers, have, existed, which, can, perform, over, 10, 17, flops, a, hundred, quadrillion, flops, 100, petaflops, or, 100, pflops, for, comparison, a, desktop, computer, has, performance, in, the, range, of, hundreds, of, gigaflops, 10, 11, to, tens, of, teraflops, 10, 13, since, november, 2017, all, of, the, world, s, fastest, 500, supercomputers, run, on, linux, based, operating, systems, additional, research, is, being, conducted, in, the, united, states, the, european, union, taiwan, japan, and, china, to, build, faster, more, powerful, and, technologically, superior, exascale, supercomputers, supercomputers, play, an, important, role, in, the, field, of, computational, science, and, are, used, for, a, wide, range, of, computationally, intensive, tasks, in, various, fields, including, quantum, mechanics, weather, forecasting, climate, research, oil, and, gas, exploration, molecular, modeling, computing, the, structures, and, properties, of, chemical, compounds, biological, macromolecules, polymers, and, crystals, and, physical, simulations, such, as, simulations, of, the, early, moments, of, the, universe, airplane, and, spacecraft, aerodynamics, the, detonation, of, nuclear, weapons, and, nuclear, fusion, they, have, been, essential, in, the, field, of, cryptanalysis, supercomputers, were, introduced, in, the, 1960s, and, for, several, decades, the, fastest, was, made, by, seymour, cray, at, control, data, corporation, cdc, cray, research, and, subsequent, companies, bearing, his, name, or, monogram, the, first, such, machines, were, highly, tuned, conventional, designs, that, ran, more, quickly, than, their, more, general, purpose, contemporaries, through, the, decade, increasing, amounts, of, parallelism, were, added, with, one, to, four, processors, being, typical, in, the, 1970s, vector, processors, operating, on, large, arrays, of, data, came, to, dominate, a, notable, example, is, the, highly, successful, cray, 1, of, 1976, vector, computers, remained, the, dominant, design, into, the, 1990s, from, then, until, today, massively, parallel, supercomputers, with, tens, of, thousands, of, off, the, shelf, processors, became, the, norm, the, us, has, long, been, the, leader, in, the, supercomputer, field, first, through, cray, s, almost, uninterrupted, dominance, of, the, field, and, later, through, a, variety, of, technology, companies, japan, made, major, strides, in, the, field, in, the, 1980s, and, 90s, with, china, becoming, increasingly, active, in, the, field, as, of, may, 2022, the, fastest, supercomputer, on, the, top500, supercomputer, list, is, frontier, in, the, us, with, a, linpack, benchmark, score, of, 1, 102, exaflop, s, followed, by, fugaku, the, us, has, five, of, the, top, 10, china, has, two, japan, finland, and, france, have, one, each, in, june, 2018, all, combined, supercomputers, on, the, top500, list, broke, the, 1, exaflops, mark, in, 1960, univac, built, the, livermore, atomic, research, computer, larc, today, considered, among, the, first, supercomputers, for, the, us, navy, research, and, development, center, it, still, used, high, speed, drum, memory, rather, than, the, newly, emerging, disk, drive, technology, also, among, the, first, supercomputers, was, the, ibm, 7030, stretch, the, ibm, 7030, was, built, by, ibm, for, the, los, alamos, national, laboratory, which, then, in, 1955, had, requested, a, computer, 100, times, faster, than, any, existing, computer, the, ibm, 7030, used, transistors, magnetic, core, memory, pipelined, instructions, prefetched, data, through, a, memory, controller, and, included, pioneering, random, access, disk, drives, the, ibm, 7030, was, completed, in, 1961, and, despite, not, meeting, the, challenge, of, a, hundredfold, increase, in, performance, it, was, purchased, by, the, los, alamos, national, laboratory, customers, in, england, and, france, also, bought, the, computer, and, it, became, the, basis, for, the, ibm, 7950, harvest, a, supercomputer, built, for, cryptanalysis, the, third, pioneering, supercomputer, project, in, the, early, 1960s, was, the, atlas, at, the, university, of, manchester, built, by, a, team, led, by, tom, kilburn, he, designed, the, atlas, to, have, memory, space, for, up, to, a, million, words, of, 48, bits, but, because, magnetic, storage, with, such, a, capacity, was, unaffordable, the, actual, core, memory, of, the, atlas, was, only, 16, 000, words, with, a, drum, providing, memory, for, a, further, 96, 000, words, the, atlas, supervisor, swapped, data, in, the, form, of, pages, between, the, magnetic, core, and, the, drum, the, atlas, operating, system, also, introduced, time, sharing, to, supercomputing, so, that, more, than, one, program, could, be, executed, on, the, supercomputer, at, any, one, time, atlas, was, a, joint, venture, between, ferranti, and, manchester, university, and, was, designed, to, operate, at, processing, speeds, approaching, one, microsecond, per, instruction, about, one, million, instructions, per, second, the, cdc, 6600, designed, by, seymour, cray, was, finished, in, 1964, and, marked, the, transition, from, germanium, to, silicon, transistors, silicon, transistors, could, run, more, quickly, and, the, overheating, problem, was, solved, by, introducing, refrigeration, to, the, supercomputer, design, thus, the, cdc6600, became, the, fastest, computer, in, the, world, given, that, the, 6600, outperformed, all, the, other, contemporary, computers, by, about, 10, times, it, was, dubbed, a, supercomputer, and, defined, the, supercomputing, market, when, one, hundred, computers, were, sold, at, 8, million, each, cray, left, cdc, in, 1972, to, form, his, own, company, cray, research, four, years, after, leaving, cdc, cray, delivered, the, 80, mhz, cray, 1, in, 1976, which, became, one, of, the, most, successful, supercomputers, in, history, the, cray, 2, was, released, in, 1985, it, had, eight, central, processing, units, cpus, liquid, cooling, and, the, electronics, coolant, liquid, fluorinert, was, pumped, through, the, supercomputer, architecture, it, reached, 1, 9, gigaflops, making, it, the, first, supercomputer, to, break, the, gigaflop, barrier, the, only, computer, to, seriously, challenge, the, cray, 1, s, performance, in, the, 1970s, was, the, illiac, iv, this, machine, was, the, first, realized, example, of, a, true, massively, parallel, computer, in, which, many, processors, worked, together, to, solve, different, parts, of, a, single, larger, problem, in, contrast, with, the, vector, systems, which, were, designed, to, run, a, single, stream, of, data, as, quickly, as, possible, in, this, concept, the, computer, instead, feeds, separate, parts, of, the, data, to, entirely, different, processors, and, then, recombines, the, results, the, illiac, s, design, was, finalized, in, 1966, with, 256, processors, and, offer, speed, up, to, 1, gflops, compared, to, the, 1970s, cray, 1, s, peak, of, 250, mflops, however, development, problems, led, to, only, 64, processors, being, built, and, the, system, could, never, operate, more, quickly, than, about, 200, mflops, while, being, much, larger, and, more, complex, than, the, cray, another, problem, was, that, writing, software, for, the, system, was, difficult, and, getting, peak, performance, from, it, was, a, matter, of, serious, effort, but, the, partial, success, of, the, illiac, iv, was, widely, seen, as, pointing, the, way, to, the, future, of, supercomputing, cray, argued, against, this, famously, quipping, that, if, you, were, plowing, a, field, which, would, you, rather, use, two, strong, oxen, or, 1024, chickens, but, by, the, early, 1980s, several, teams, were, working, on, parallel, designs, with, thousands, of, processors, notably, the, connection, machine, cm, that, developed, from, research, at, mit, the, cm, 1, used, as, many, as, 65, 536, simplified, custom, microprocessors, connected, together, in, a, network, to, share, data, several, updated, versions, followed, the, cm, 5, supercomputer, is, a, massively, parallel, processing, computer, capable, of, many, billions, of, arithmetic, operations, per, second, in, 1982, osaka, university, s, links, 1, computer, graphics, system, used, a, massively, parallel, processing, architecture, with, 514, microprocessors, including, 257, zilog, z8001, control, processors, and, 257, iapx, 86, 20, floating, point, processors, it, was, mainly, used, for, rendering, realistic, 3d, computer, graphics, fujitsu, s, vpp500, from, 1992, is, unusual, since, to, achieve, higher, speeds, its, processors, used, gaas, a, material, normally, reserved, for, microwave, applications, due, to, its, toxicity, fujitsu, s, numerical, wind, tunnel, supercomputer, used, 166, vector, processors, to, gain, the, top, spot, in, 1994, with, a, peak, speed, of, 1, 7, gigaflops, gflops, per, processor, the, hitachi, sr2201, obtained, a, peak, performance, of, 600, gflops, in, 1996, by, using, 2048, processors, connected, via, a, fast, three, dimensional, crossbar, network, the, intel, paragon, could, have, 1000, to, 4000, intel, i860, processors, in, various, configurations, and, was, ranked, the, fastest, in, the, world, in, 1993, the, paragon, was, a, mimd, machine, which, connected, processors, via, a, high, speed, two, dimensional, mesh, allowing, processes, to, execute, on, separate, nodes, communicating, via, the, message, passing, interface, software, development, remained, a, problem, but, the, cm, series, sparked, off, considerable, research, into, this, issue, similar, designs, using, custom, hardware, were, made, by, many, companies, including, the, evans, sutherland, es, 1, maspar, ncube, intel, ipsc, and, the, goodyear, mpp, but, by, the, mid, 1990s, general, purpose, cpu, performance, had, improved, so, much, in, that, a, supercomputer, could, be, built, using, them, as, the, individual, processing, units, instead, of, using, custom, chips, by, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, designs, featuring, tens, of, thousands, of, commodity, cpus, were, the, norm, with, later, machines, adding, graphic, units, to, the, mix, in, 1998, david, bader, developed, the, first, linux, supercomputer, using, commodity, parts, while, at, the, university, of, new, mexico, bader, sought, to, build, a, supercomputer, running, linux, using, consumer, off, the, shelf, parts, and, a, high, speed, low, latency, interconnection, network, the, prototype, utilized, an, alta, technologies, altacluster, of, eight, dual, 333, mhz, intel, pentium, ii, computers, running, a, modified, linux, kernel, bader, ported, a, significant, amount, of, software, to, provide, linux, support, for, necessary, components, as, well, as, code, from, members, of, the, national, computational, science, alliance, ncsa, to, ensure, interoperability, as, none, of, it, had, been, run, on, linux, previously, using, the, successful, prototype, design, he, led, the, development, of, roadrunner, the, first, linux, supercomputer, for, open, use, by, the, national, science, and, engineering, community, via, the, national, science, foundation, s, national, technology, grid, roadrunner, was, put, into, production, use, in, april, 1999, at, the, time, of, its, deployment, it, was, considered, one, of, the, 100, fastest, supercomputers, in, the, world, though, linux, based, clusters, using, consumer, grade, parts, such, as, beowulf, existed, prior, to, the, development, of, bader, s, prototype, and, roadrunner, they, lacked, the, scalability, bandwidth, and, parallel, computing, capabilities, to, be, considered, true, supercomputers, systems, with, a, massive, number, of, processors, generally, take, one, of, two, paths, in, the, grid, computing, approach, the, processing, power, of, many, computers, organized, as, distributed, diverse, administrative, domains, is, opportunistically, used, whenever, a, computer, is, available, in, another, approach, many, processors, are, used, in, proximity, to, each, other, e, g, in, a, computer, cluster, in, such, a, centralized, massively, parallel, system, the, speed, and, flexibility, of, the, interconnect, becomes, very, important, and, modern, supercomputers, have, used, various, approaches, ranging, from, enhanced, infiniband, systems, to, three, dimensional, torus, interconnects, the, use, of, multi, core, processors, combined, with, centralization, is, an, emerging, direction, e, g, as, in, the, cyclops64, system, as, the, price, performance, and, energy, efficiency, of, general, purpose, graphics, processing, units, gpgpus, have, improved, a, number, of, petaflops, supercomputers, such, as, tianhe, i, and, nebulae, have, started, to, rely, on, them, however, other, systems, such, as, the, k, computer, continue, to, use, conventional, processors, such, as, sparc, based, designs, and, the, overall, applicability, of, gpgpus, in, general, purpose, high, performance, computing, applications, has, been, the, subject, of, debate, in, that, while, a, gpgpu, may, be, tuned, to, score, well, on, specific, benchmarks, its, overall, applicability, to, everyday, algorithms, may, be, limited, unless, significant, effort, is, spent, to, tune, the, application, to, it, however, gpus, are, gaining, ground, and, in, 2012, the, jaguar, supercomputer, was, transformed, into, titan, by, retrofitting, cpus, with, gpus, high, performance, computers, have, an, expected, life, cycle, of, about, three, years, before, requiring, an, upgrade, the, gyoukou, supercomputer, is, unique, in, that, it, uses, both, a, massively, parallel, design, and, liquid, immersion, cooling, a, number, of, special, purpose, systems, have, been, designed, dedicated, to, a, single, problem, this, allows, the, use, of, specially, programmed, fpga, chips, or, even, custom, asics, allowing, better, price, performance, ratios, by, sacrificing, generality, examples, of, special, purpose, supercomputers, include, belle, deep, blue, and, hydra, for, playing, chess, gravity, pipe, for, astrophysics, mdgrape, 3, for, protein, structure, prediction, and, molecular, dynamics, and, deep, crack, for, breaking, the, des, cipher, throughout, the, decades, the, management, of, heat, density, has, remained, a, key, issue, for, most, centralized, supercomputers, the, large, amount, of, heat, generated, by, a, system, may, also, have, other, effects, e, g, reducing, the, lifetime, of, other, system, components, there, have, been, diverse, approaches, to, heat, management, from, pumping, fluorinert, through, the, system, to, a, hybrid, liquid, air, cooling, system, or, air, cooling, with, normal, air, conditioning, temperatures, a, typical, supercomputer, consumes, large, amounts, of, electrical, power, almost, all, of, which, is, converted, into, heat, requiring, cooling, for, example, tianhe, 1a, consumes, 4, 04, megawatts, mw, of, electricity, the, cost, to, power, and, cool, the, system, can, be, significant, e, g, 4, mw, at, 0, 10, kwh, is, 400, an, hour, or, about, 3, 5, million, per, year, heat, management, is, a, major, issue, in, complex, electronic, devices, and, affects, powerful, computer, systems, in, various, ways, the, thermal, design, power, and, cpu, power, dissipation, issues, in, supercomputing, surpass, those, of, traditional, computer, cooling, technologies, the, supercomputing, awards, for, green, computing, reflect, this, issue, the, packing, of, thousands, of, processors, together, inevitably, generates, significant, amounts, of, heat, density, that, need, to, be, dealt, with, the, cray, 2, was, liquid, cooled, and, used, a, fluorinert, cooling, waterfall, which, was, forced, through, the, modules, under, pressure, however, the, submerged, liquid, cooling, approach, was, not, practical, for, the, multi, cabinet, systems, based, on, off, the, shelf, processors, and, in, system, x, a, special, cooling, system, that, combined, air, conditioning, with, liquid, cooling, was, developed, in, conjunction, with, the, liebert, company, in, the, blue, gene, system, ibm, deliberately, used, low, power, processors, to, deal, with, heat, density, the, ibm, power, 775, released, in, 2011, has, closely, packed, elements, that, require, water, cooling, the, ibm, aquasar, system, uses, hot, water, cooling, to, achieve, energy, efficiency, the, water, being, used, to, heat, buildings, as, well, the, energy, efficiency, of, computer, systems, is, generally, measured, in, terms, of, flops, per, watt, in, 2008, roadrunner, by, ibm, operated, at, 376, mflops, w, in, november, 2010, the, blue, gene, q, reached, 1, 684, mflops, w, and, in, june, 2011, the, top, two, spots, on, the, green, 500, list, were, occupied, by, blue, gene, machines, in, new, york, one, achieving, 2097, mflops, w, with, the, degima, cluster, in, nagasaki, placing, third, with, 1375, mflops, w, because, copper, wires, can, transfer, energy, into, a, supercomputer, with, much, higher, power, densities, than, forced, air, or, circulating, refrigerants, can, remove, waste, heat, the, ability, of, the, cooling, systems, to, remove, waste, heat, is, a, limiting, factor, as, of, 2015, many, existing, supercomputers, have, more, infrastructure, capacity, than, the, actual, peak, demand, of, the, machine, designers, generally, conservatively, design, the, power, and, cooling, infrastructure, to, handle, more, than, the, theoretical, peak, electrical, power, consumed, by, the, supercomputer, designs, for, future, supercomputers, are, power, limited, the, thermal, design, power, of, the, supercomputer, as, a, whole, the, amount, that, the, power, and, cooling, infrastructure, can, handle, is, somewhat, more, than, the, expected, normal, power, consumption, but, less, than, the, theoretical, peak, power, consumption, of, the, electronic, hardware, since, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, supercomputer, operating, systems, have, undergone, major, transformations, based, on, the, changes, in, supercomputer, architecture, while, early, operating, systems, were, custom, tailored, to, each, supercomputer, to, gain, speed, the, trend, has, been, to, move, away, from, in, house, operating, systems, to, the, adaptation, of, generic, software, such, as, linux, since, modern, massively, parallel, supercomputers, typically, separate, computations, from, other, services, by, using, multiple, types, of, nodes, they, usually, run, different, operating, systems, on, different, nodes, e, g, using, a, small, and, efficient, lightweight, kernel, such, as, cnk, or, cnl, on, compute, nodes, but, a, larger, system, such, as, a, linux, derivative, on, server, and, i, o, nodes, while, in, a, traditional, multi, user, computer, system, job, scheduling, is, in, effect, a, tasking, problem, for, processing, and, peripheral, resources, in, a, massively, parallel, system, the, job, management, system, needs, to, manage, the, allocation, of, both, computational, and, communication, resources, as, well, as, gracefully, deal, with, inevitable, hardware, failures, when, tens, of, thousands, of, processors, are, present, although, most, modern, supercomputers, use, linux, based, operating, systems, each, manufacturer, has, its, own, specific, linux, derivative, and, no, industry, standard, exists, partly, due, to, the, fact, that, the, differences, in, hardware, architectures, require, changes, to, optimize, the, operating, system, to, each, hardware, design, the, parallel, architectures, of, supercomputers, often, dictate, the, use, of, special, programming, techniques, to, exploit, their, speed, software, tools, for, distributed, processing, include, standard, apis, such, as, mpi, and, pvm, vtl, and, open, source, software, such, as, beowulf, in, the, most, common, scenario, environments, such, as, pvm, and, mpi, for, loosely, connected, clusters, and, openmp, for, tightly, coordinated, shared, memory, machines, are, used, significant, effort, is, required, to, optimize, an, algorithm, for, the, interconnect, characteristics, of, the, machine, it, will, be, run, on, the, aim, is, to, prevent, any, of, the, cpus, from, wasting, time, waiting, on, data, from, other, nodes, gpgpus, have, hundreds, of, processor, cores, and, are, programmed, using, programming, models, such, as, cuda, or, opencl, moreover, it, is, quite, difficult, to, debug, and, test, parallel, programs, special, techniques, need, to, be, used, for, testing, and, debugging, such, applications, opportunistic, supercomputing, is, a, form, of, networked, grid, computing, whereby, a, super, virtual, computer, of, many, loosely, coupled, volunteer, computing, machines, performs, very, large, computing, tasks, grid, computing, has, been, applied, to, a, number, of, large, scale, embarrassingly, parallel, problems, that, require, supercomputing, performance, scales, however, basic, grid, and, cloud, computing, approaches, that, rely, on, volunteer, computing, cannot, handle, traditional, supercomputing, tasks, such, as, fluid, dynamic, simulations, the, fastest, grid, computing, system, is, the, volunteer, computing, project, folding, home, f, h, as, of, april, 2020, f, h, reported, 2, 5, exaflops, of, x86, processing, power, of, this, over, 100, pflops, are, contributed, by, clients, running, on, various, gpus, and, the, rest, from, various, cpu, systems, the, berkeley, open, infrastructure, for, network, computing, boinc, platform, hosts, a, number, of, volunteer, computing, projects, as, of, february, 2017, boinc, recorded, a, processing, power, of, over, 166, petaflops, through, over, 762, thousand, active, computers, hosts, on, the, network, as, of, october, 2016, great, internet, mersenne, prime, search, s, gimps, distributed, mersenne, prime, search, achieved, about, 0, 313, pflops, through, over, 1, 3, million, computers, the, primenet, server, has, supported, gimps, s, grid, computing, approach, one, of, the, earliest, volunteer, computing, projects, since, 1997, quasi, opportunistic, supercomputing, is, a, form, of, distributed, computing, whereby, the, super, virtual, computer, of, many, networked, geographically, disperse, computers, performs, computing, tasks, that, demand, huge, processing, power, quasi, opportunistic, supercomputing, aims, to, provide, a, higher, quality, of, service, than, opportunistic, grid, computing, by, achieving, more, control, over, the, assignment, of, tasks, to, distributed, resources, and, the, use, of, intelligence, about, the, availability, and, reliability, of, individual, systems, within, the, supercomputing, network, however, quasi, opportunistic, distributed, execution, of, demanding, parallel, computing, software, in, grids, should, be, achieved, through, the, implementation, of, grid, wise, allocation, agreements, co, allocation, subsystems, communication, topology, aware, allocation, mechanisms, fault, tolerant, message, passing, libraries, and, data, pre, conditioning, cloud, computing, with, its, recent, and, rapid, expansions, and, development, have, grabbed, the, attention, of, high, performance, computing, hpc, users, and, developers, in, recent, years, cloud, computing, attempts, to, provide, hpc, as, a, service, exactly, like, other, forms, of, services, available, in, the, cloud, such, as, software, as, a, service, platform, as, a, service, and, infrastructure, as, a, service, hpc, users, may, benefit, from, the, cloud, in, different, angles, such, as, scalability, resources, being, on, demand, fast, and, inexpensive, on, the, other, hand, moving, hpc, applications, have, a, set, of, challenges, too, good, examples, of, such, challenges, are, virtualization, overhead, in, the, cloud, multi, tenancy, of, resources, and, network, latency, issues, much, research, is, currently, being, done, to, overcome, these, challenges, and, make, hpc, in, the, cloud, a, more, realistic, possibility, in, 2016, penguin, computing, parallel, works, r, hpc, amazon, web, services, univa, silicon, graphics, international, rescale, sabalcore, and, gomput, started, to, offer, hpc, cloud, computing, the, penguin, on, demand, pod, cloud, is, a, bare, metal, compute, model, to, execute, code, but, each, user, is, given, virtualized, login, node, pod, computing, nodes, are, connected, via, non, virtualized, 10, gbit, s, ethernet, or, qdr, infiniband, networks, user, connectivity, to, the, pod, data, center, ranges, from, 50, mbit, s, to, 1, gbit, s, citing, amazon, s, ec2, elastic, compute, cloud, penguin, computing, argues, that, virtualization, of, compute, nodes, is, not, suitable, for, hpc, penguin, computing, has, also, criticized, that, hpc, clouds, may, have, allocated, computing, nodes, to, customers, that, are, far, apart, causing, latency, that, impairs, performance, for, some, hpc, applications, supercomputers, generally, aim, for, the, maximum, in, capability, computing, rather, than, capacity, computing, capability, computing, is, typically, thought, of, as, using, the, maximum, computing, power, to, solve, a, single, large, problem, in, the, shortest, amount, of, time, often, a, capability, system, is, able, to, solve, a, problem, of, a, size, or, complexity, that, no, other, computer, can, e, g, a, very, complex, weather, simulation, application, capacity, computing, in, contrast, is, typically, thought, of, as, using, efficient, cost, effective, computing, power, to, solve, a, few, somewhat, large, problems, or, many, small, problems, architectures, that, lend, themselves, to, supporting, many, users, for, routine, everyday, tasks, may, have, a, lot, of, capacity, but, are, not, typically, considered, supercomputers, given, that, they, do, not, solve, a, single, very, complex, problem, in, general, the, speed, of, supercomputers, is, measured, and, benchmarked, in, flops, floating, point, operations, per, second, and, not, in, terms, of, mips, million, instructions, per, second, as, is, the, case, with, general, purpose, computers, these, measurements, are, commonly, used, with, an, si, prefix, such, as, tera, combined, into, the, shorthand, tflops, 10, 12, flops, pronounced, teraflops, or, peta, combined, into, the, shorthand, pflops, 10, 15, flops, pronounced, petaflops, petascale, supercomputers, can, process, one, quadrillion, 10, 15, 1000, trillion, flops, exascale, is, computing, performance, in, the, exaflops, eflops, range, an, eflops, is, one, quintillion, 10, 18, flops, one, million, tflops, however, the, performance, of, a, supercomputer, can, be, severely, impacted, by, fluctuation, brought, on, by, elements, like, system, load, network, traffic, and, concurrent, processes, as, mentioned, by, brehm, and, bruhwiler, 2015, no, single, number, can, reflect, the, overall, performance, of, a, computer, system, yet, the, goal, of, the, linpack, benchmark, is, to, approximate, how, fast, the, computer, solves, numerical, problems, and, it, is, widely, used, in, the, industry, the, flops, measurement, is, either, quoted, based, on, the, theoretical, floating, point, performance, of, a, processor, derived, from, manufacturer, s, processor, specifications, and, shown, as, rpeak, in, the, top500, lists, which, is, generally, unachievable, when, running, real, workloads, or, the, achievable, throughput, derived, from, the, linpack, benchmarks, and, shown, as, rmax, in, the, top500, list, the, linpack, benchmark, typically, performs, lu, decomposition, of, a, large, matrix, the, linpack, performance, gives, some, indication, of, performance, for, some, real, world, problems, but, does, not, necessarily, match, the, processing, requirements, of, many, other, supercomputer, workloads, which, for, example, may, require, more, memory, bandwidth, or, may, require, better, integer, computing, performance, or, may, need, a, high, performance, i, o, system, to, achieve, high, levels, of, performance, since, 1993, the, fastest, supercomputers, have, been, ranked, on, the, top500, list, according, to, their, linpack, benchmark, results, the, list, does, not, claim, to, be, unbiased, or, definitive, but, it, is, a, widely, cited, current, definition, of, the, fastest, supercomputer, available, at, any, given, time, this, is, a, list, of, the, computers, which, appeared, at, the, top, of, the, top500, list, since, june, 1993, and, the, peak, speed, is, given, as, the, rmax, rating, in, 2018, lenovo, became, the, world, s, largest, provider, for, the, top500, supercomputers, with,
