an, attack, aircraft, strike, aircraft, or, attack, bomber, is, a, tactical, military, aircraft, that, has, a, primary, role, of, carrying, out, airstrikes, with, greater, precision, than, bombers, and, is, prepared, to, encounter, strong, low, level, air, defenses, while, pressing, the, attack, this, class, of, aircraft, is, designed, mostly, for, close, air, support, and, naval, air, to, surface, missions, overlapping, the, tactical, bomber, mission, designs, dedicated, to, non, naval, roles, are, often, known, as, ground, attack, aircraft, fighter, aircraft, often, carry, out, the, attack, role, although, they, would, not, be, considered, attack, aircraft, per, se, fighter, bomber, conversions, of, those, same, aircraft, would, be, considered, part, of, the, class, strike, fighters, which, have, effectively, replaced, the, fighter, bomber, and, light, bomber, concepts, also, differ, little, from, the, broad, concept, of, an, attack, aircraft, the, dedicated, attack, aircraft, as, a, separate, class, existed, primarily, during, and, after, world, war, ii, the, precise, implementation, varied, from, country, to, country, and, was, handled, by, a, wide, variety, of, designs, in, the, united, states, and, britain, attack, aircraft, were, generally, light, bombers, or, medium, bombers, sometimes, carrying, heavier, forward, firing, weapons, like, the, north, american, b, 25g, mitchell, and, de, havilland, mosquito, tsetse, in, germany, and, the, ussr, where, they, were, known, as, schlachtflugzeug, battle, aircraft, or, sturmovik, storm, trooper, respectively, this, role, was, carried, out, by, purpose, designed, and, heavily, armored, aircraft, such, as, the, henschel, hs, 129, and, ilyushin, il, 2, the, germans, and, soviets, also, used, light, bombers, in, this, role, cannon, armed, versions, of, the, junkers, ju, 87, stuka, greatly, outnumbered, the, hs, 129, while, the, petlyakov, pe, 2, was, used, for, this, role, in, spite, of, not, being, specifically, designed, for, it, in, the, latter, part, of, world, war, ii, the, fighter, bomber, began, to, take, over, many, attack, roles, a, transition, that, continued, in, the, post, war, era, jet, powered, examples, were, relatively, rare, but, not, unknown, such, as, the, blackburn, buccaneer, the, u, s, navy, continued, to, introduce, new, aircraft, in, their, a, series, but, these, were, mostly, similar, to, light, and, medium, bombers, the, need, for, a, separate, attack, aircraft, category, was, greatly, diminished, by, the, introduction, of, precision, guided, munitions, which, allowed, almost, any, aircraft, to, carry, out, this, role, while, remaining, safe, at, high, altitude, attack, helicopters, also, have, overtaken, many, remaining, roles, that, could, only, be, carried, out, at, lower, altitudes, since, the, 1960s, only, two, dedicated, attack, aircraft, designs, have, been, widely, introduced, the, american, fairchild, republic, a, 10, thunderbolt, ii, and, the, soviet, russian, sukhoi, su, 25, frogfoot, a, variety, of, light, attack, aircraft, has, also, been, introduced, in, the, post, world, war, ii, era, usually, based, on, adapted, trainers, or, other, light, fixed, wing, aircraft, these, have, been, used, in, counter, insurgency, operations, u, s, attack, aircraft, are, currently, identified, by, the, prefix, a, as, in, a, 6, intruder, and, a, 10, thunderbolt, ii, however, until, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, a, designation, was, shared, between, attack, planes, and, light, bombers, for, usaaf, aircraft, as, opposed, to, b, prefix, for, medium, or, heavy, bombers, the, us, navy, used, a, separate, designation, system, and, at, the, time, preferred, to, call, similar, aircraft, scout, bombers, sb, or, torpedo, bombers, tb, or, bt, for, example, douglas, sbd, dauntless, scout, bomber, was, designated, a, 24, when, used, by, the, usaaf, it, was, not, until, 1946, when, the, us, navy, and, us, marine, corps, started, using, the, attack, a, designation, when, it, renamed, bt2d, skyraider, and, btm, mauler, to, respectively, ad, skyraider, and, am, mauler, as, with, many, aircraft, classifications, the, definition, of, attack, aircraft, is, somewhat, vague, and, has, tended, to, change, over, time, current, u, s, military, doctrine, defines, it, as, an, aircraft, which, most, likely, performs, an, attack, mission, more, than, any, other, kind, of, mission, attack, mission, means, in, turn, specifically, tactical, air, to, ground, action, in, other, words, neither, air, to, air, action, nor, strategic, bombing, is, considered, an, attack, mission, in, united, states, navy, vocabulary, the, alternative, designation, for, the, same, activity, is, a, strike, mission, attack, missions, are, principally, divided, into, two, categories, air, interdiction, and, close, air, support, in, the, last, several, decades, the, rise, of, the, ubiquitous, multi, role, fighter, has, created, some, confusion, about, the, difference, between, attack, and, fighter, aircraft, according, to, the, current, u, s, designation, system, an, attack, aircraft, a, is, designed, primarily, for, air, to, surface, attack, aircraft, designed, to, find, attack, and, destroy, land, or, sea, targets, missions, also, known, as, attack, missions, while, a, fighter, category, f, incorporates, not, only, aircraft, designed, primarily, for, air, to, air, combat, but, additionally, multipurpose, aircraft, designed, also, for, ground, attack, missions, f, fighter, aircraft, were, designed, to, intercept, and, destroy, other, aircraft, or, missiles, this, includes, multipurpose, aircraft, also, designed, for, ground, support, missions, such, as, interdiction, and, close, air, support, just, to, mention, one, example, amongst, many, the, f, 111, aardvark, was, designated, f, despite, having, only, minimal, air, to, air, capabilities, only, a, single, aircraft, in, the, usaf, s, current, inventory, bears, a, simple, unmixed, a, designation, the, a, 10, thunderbolt, ii, british, designations, have, included, fb, for, fighter, bomber, and, more, recently, g, for, ground, attack, as, in, harrier, gr1, meaning, ground, attack, reconnaissance, mark, 1, imperial, japanese, navy, designation, use, b, to, designate, carrier, attack, bomber, such, as, the, nakajima, b5n, type, 97, bomber, although, these, aircraft, are, mostly, used, for, torpedo, attack, and, level, bombing, they, also, use, d, to, specifically, designate, carrier, dive, bomber, like, the, yokosuka, d4y, suisei, however, by, the, end, of, the, world, war, ii, the, ijn, introduced, the, aichi, b7a, ryusei, which, could, performed, both, torpedo, bombing, and, dive, bombing, rendering, the, d, designation, redundant, the, nato, reporting, names, for, soviet, russian, ground, attack, aircraft, at, first, started, with, b, categorizing, them, as, bombers, as, in, case, of, il, 10, beast, but, later, they, were, usually, classified, as, fighters, f, possibly, because, since, sukhoi, su, 7, they, were, similar, in, size, and, visual, appearance, to, soviet, fighters, or, were, simply, derivatives, of, such, the, attack, aircraft, as, a, role, was, defined, by, its, use, during, world, war, i, in, support, of, ground, forces, on, battlefields, battlefield, support, is, generally, divided, into, close, air, support, and, battlefield, air, interdiction, the, first, requiring, strict, and, the, latter, only, general, cooperation, with, friendly, surface, forces, such, aircraft, also, attacked, targets, in, rear, areas, such, missions, required, flying, where, light, anti, aircraft, fire, was, expected, and, operating, at, low, altitudes, to, precisely, identify, targets, other, roles, including, those, of, light, bombers, medium, bombers, dive, bombers, reconnaissance, fighters, fighter, bombers, could, and, did, perform, air, strikes, on, battlefields, all, these, types, could, significantly, damage, ground, targets, from, a, low, level, flight, either, by, bombing, machine, guns, or, both, attack, aircraft, came, to, diverge, from, bombers, and, fighters, while, bombers, could, be, used, on, a, battlefield, their, slower, speeds, made, them, extremely, vulnerable, to, ground, fire, as, did, the, lighter, construction, of, fighters, the, survivability, of, attack, aircraft, was, guaranteed, by, their, speed, power, protection, i, e, armor, panels, and, strength, of, construction, germany, was, the, first, country, to, produce, dedicated, ground, attack, aircraft, designated, cl, class, and, j, class, they, were, put, into, use, in, autumn, 1917, during, world, war, i, most, notable, was, the, junkers, j, i, which, pioneered, the, idea, of, an, armored, bathtub, that, was, both, fuselage, structure, and, protection, for, engine, and, crew, the, british, experimented, with, the, sopwith, tf, series, termed, trench, fighters, although, these, did, not, see, combat, the, last, battles, of, 1918, on, the, western, front, demonstrated, that, ground, attacking, aircraft, were, a, valuable, component, of, all, arms, tactics, close, support, ground, strafing, machine, gunning, and, tactical, bombing, of, infantry, especially, when, moving, between, trenches, and, along, roads, machine, gun, posts, artillery, and, supply, formations, was, a, part, of, the, allied, armies, strength, in, holding, german, attacks, and, supporting, allied, counter, attacks, and, offensives, admittedly, the, cost, to, the, allies, was, high, with, the, royal, flying, corps, sustaining, a, loss, rate, approaching, 30, among, ground, attack, aircraft, after, world, war, i, it, was, widely, believed, that, using, aircraft, against, tactical, targets, was, of, little, use, other, than, in, harassing, and, undermining, enemy, morale, attacking, combatants, was, generally, much, more, dangerous, to, aircrews, than, their, targets, a, problem, that, was, continually, becoming, more, acute, with, the, ongoing, refinement, of, anti, aircraft, weapons, within, the, range, of, types, serving, attack, roles, dive, bombers, were, increasingly, being, seen, as, more, effective, than, aircraft, designed, for, strafing, with, machine, guns, or, cannons, nevertheless, during, the, 1920s, the, us, military, in, particular, procured, specialized, attack, aircraft, and, formed, dedicated, units, that, were, trained, primarily, for, that, role, the, us, army, engineering, division, became, involved, in, designing, ground, attack, aircraft, the, 1920, boeing, ga, 1, was, an, armored, twin, engine, triplane, for, ground, strafing, with, eight, machine, guns, and, about, a, ton, of, armor, plate, and, the, 1922, aeromarine, pg, 1, was, a, combined, pursuit, fighter, and, ground, attack, design, with, a, 37mm, gun, the, united, states, marine, corps, aviation, applied, close, air, support, tactics, in, the, banana, wars, while, they, did, not, pioneer, dive, bombing, tactics, marine, aviators, were, the, first, to, include, it, in, their, doctrine, during, the, united, states, occupation, of, haiti, and, nicaragua, the, united, states, army, air, corps, was, notable, for, its, creation, of, a, separate, a, designation, for, attack, types, distinct, from, and, alongside, b, for, bomber, types, and, p, for, pursuit, later, replaced, by, f, for, fighter, aircraft, the, first, designated, attack, type, to, be, operational, with, the, usaac, was, the, curtiss, a, 2, falcon, nevertheless, such, aircraft, including, the, a, 2, s, replacement, the, curtiss, a, 12, shrike, were, unarmored, and, highly, vulnerable, to, aa, fire, the, british, royal, air, force, focused, primarily, on, strategic, bombing, rather, than, ground, attack, however, like, most, air, arms, of, the, period, it, did, operate, attack, aircraft, named, army, cooperation, in, raf, parlance, which, included, the, hawker, hector, westland, lysander, and, others, aviation, played, a, role, in, the, brazilian, constitutionalist, revolution, of, 1932, although, both, sides, had, few, aircraft, the, federal, government, had, approximately, 58, aircraft, divided, between, the, navy, and, the, army, as, the, air, force, at, this, time, did, not, constitute, an, independent, branch, in, contrast, the, rebels, had, only, two, potez, 25, planes, and, two, waco, cso, plus, a, small, number, of, private, aircraft, during, the, 1930s, nazi, germany, had, begun, to, field, a, class, of, schlacht, battle, aircraft, such, as, the, henschel, hs, 123, moreover, the, experiences, of, german, condor, legion, during, the, spanish, civil, war, against, an, enemy, with, few, fighter, aircraft, changed, ideas, about, ground, attack, though, equipped, with, generally, unsuitable, designs, such, as, the, henschel, hs, 123, and, cannon, armed, versions, of, the, heinkel, he, 112, their, armament, and, pilots, proved, that, aircraft, were, a, very, effective, weapon, even, without, bombs, this, led, to, some, support, within, the, luftwaffe, for, the, creation, of, an, aircraft, dedicated, to, this, role, resulting, in, tenders, for, a, new, attack, aircraft, this, led, to, the, introduction, in, 1942, of, a, unique, single, seat, twin, engine, attack, aircraft, the, slow, moving, but, heavily, armored, and, formidably, armed, henschel, hs, 129, panzerknacker, safecracker, tank, cracker, in, japan, the, imperial, japanese, navy, had, developed, the, aichi, d3a, dive, bomber, based, on, the, heinkel, he, 70, and, the, mitsubishi, b5m, light, attack, bomber, both, like, their, us, counterparts, were, lightly, armored, types, and, were, critically, reliant, on, surprise, attacks, and, the, absence, of, significant, fighter, or, aa, opposition, during, the, winter, war, the, soviet, air, forces, used, the, polikarpov, r, 5, sss, and, polikarpov, r, z, sh, as, attack, aircraft, perhaps, the, most, notable, attack, type, to, emerge, during, the, late, 1930s, was, the, soviet, ilyushin, il, 2, sturmovik, which, became, the, most, produced, military, aircraft, type, in, history, as, world, war, ii, approached, the, concept, of, an, attack, aircraft, was, not, well, defined, and, various, air, services, used, many, different, names, for, widely, differing, types, all, performing, similar, roles, sometimes, in, tandem, with, non, attack, roles, of, bombers, fighters, reconnaissance, and, other, roles, the, british, concept, of, a, light, aircraft, mixing, all, the, roles, that, required, extensive, communication, with, land, forces, reconnaissance, liaison, artillery, spotting, aerial, supply, and, last, but, not, least, occasional, strikes, on, the, battlefield, the, concept, was, similar, to, front, line, aircraft, used, in, the, world, war, i, which, was, called, the, cl, class, in, the, german, empire, eventually, the, raf, s, experience, showed, types, such, as, westland, lysander, to, be, unacceptably, vulnerable, and, it, was, replaced, by, faster, fighter, types, for, photoreconnaissance, and, light, aircraft, for, artillery, spotting, during, the, inter, war, period, the, british, considered, that, in, a, future, war, it, would, be, france, that, would, be, the, enemy, for, the, light, day, bomber, they, had, the, fairey, battle, which, originated, in, a, 1932, specification, designs, in, 1938, for, a, replacement, were, adapted, as, a, target, tug, the, last, british, specification, issued, for, a, light, bomber, was, b, 20, 40, described, as, a, close, army, support, bomber, capable, of, dive, bombing, and, photoreconnaissance, however, the, specification, was, dropped, before, an, aircraft, went, into, production, in, some, air, services, dive, bombers, did, not, equip, ground, attack, units, but, were, treated, as, a, separate, class, in, nazi, germany, the, luftwaffe, distinguished, between, the, stuka, sturzkampf, dive, bombing, units, equipped, with, junkers, ju, 87, from, schlacht, battle, units, using, strafing, low, level, bombing, types, such, as, the, henschel, hs, 123, although, not, a, synonymous, class, with, ground, attack, aircraft, fighter, bombers, were, usually, used, for, the, role, and, proved, to, excel, at, it, even, when, they, were, only, lightly, armored, the, royal, air, force, and, united, states, army, air, forces, relegated, obsolescent, fighters, to, this, role, while, cutting, edge, fighters, would, serve, as, interceptors, and, establish, air, superiority, the, united, states, navy, in, distinction, to, the, usaaf, preferred, the, older, term, scout, bomber, under, a, sb, designation, such, as, the, curtiss, sb2c, helldiver, the, junkers, ju, 87s, of, the, german, luftwaffe, became, virtually, synonymous, with, close, air, support, during, the, early, months, of, world, war, ii, the, british, commonwealth, s, desert, air, force, led, by, arthur, tedder, became, the, first, allied, tactical, formation, to, emphasize, the, attack, role, usually, in, the, form, of, single, engine, hawker, hurricane, and, curtiss, p, 40, fighter, bombers, or, specialized, tank, busters, such, as, the, hurricane, mk, iid, armed, with, two, 40, mm, vickers, s, guns, notably, no, 6, squadron, raf, at, around, the, same, time, a, massive, invasion, by, axis, forces, had, forced, the, soviet, air, forces, to, quickly, expand, their, army, support, capacity, such, as, the, ilyushin, il, 2, sturmovik, the, women, pilots, known, as, the, night, witches, utilised, an, obsolescent, wooden, light, trainer, biplane, type, the, polikarpov, po, 2, and, small, anti, personnel, bombs, in, harassment, bombing, attacks, that, proved, difficult, to, counter, wartime, experience, showed, that, poorly, armored, and, or, lightly, built, pre, war, types, were, unacceptably, vulnerable, especially, to, fighters, nevertheless, skilled, crews, could, be, highly, successful, in, those, types, such, as, the, leading, stuka, ace, hans, ulrich, rudel, who, claimed, 500, tanks, a, battleship, a, cruiser, and, two, destroyers, in, 2, 300, combat, missions, the, bristol, beaufighter, based, on, an, obsolescent, raf, bomber, became, a, versatile, twin, engine, attack, aircraft, and, served, in, almost, every, theatre, of, the, war, in, the, maritime, strike, and, ground, attack, roles, as, well, as, that, of, night, fighter, conversely, some, mid, war, attack, types, emerged, as, adaptations, of, fighters, including, several, versions, of, the, german, focke, wulf, fw, 190, the, british, hawker, typhoon, and, the, us, republic, p, 47, thunderbolt, the, typhoon, which, was, disappointing, as, a, fighter, due, to, poor, high, altitude, performance, was, very, fast, at, low, altitudes, and, thus, became, the, raf, s, premier, ground, attack, fighter, it, was, armed, with, four, 20mm, cannon, augmented, first, with, bombs, then, rockets, likewise, the, p, 47, was, designed, and, intended, for, use, as, a, high, altitude, bomber, escort, but, gradually, found, that, role, filled, by, the, north, american, p, 51, mustang, because, of, its, much, longer, range, and, greater, maneuverability, the, p, 47, was, also, heavier, and, more, robust, than, the, p, 51, and, regarded, therefore, as, an, energy, fighter, ideal, for, high, speed, dive, and, climb, tactics, including, strafing, attacks, its, armament, of, eight, 0, 50, caliber, machine, guns, was, effective, against, axis, infantry, and, light, vehicles, in, both, europe, and, the, pacific, while, machine, guns, and, cannon, were, initially, sufficient, the, evolution, of, well, armored, tanks, required, heavier, weapons, to, augment, bombs, high, explosive, rockets, were, introduced, although, these, unguided, projectiles, were, still, barely, adequate, because, of, their, inaccuracy, for, the, british, rp3, one, hit, per, sortie, was, considered, acceptable, however, even, a, near, miss, with, rockets, could, cause, damage, or, injuries, to, soft, targets, and, patrols, by, allied, rocket, armed, aircraft, over, normandy, disrupted, or, even, completely, paralyzed, german, road, traffic, they, also, affected, morale, because, even, the, prospect, of, a, rocket, attack, was, unnerving, the, ultimate, development, of, the, cannon, armed, light, attack, aircraft, was, the, small, production, run, in, 1944, of, the, henschel, hs, 129, b, 3, armed, with, a, modified, pak, 40, 75, mm, anti, tank, gun, this, weapon, the, bordkanone, bk, 7, 5, was, the, most, powerful, forward, firing, weapon, fitted, to, a, production, military, aircraft, during, world, war, ii, the, only, other, aircraft, to, be, factory, equipped, with, similar, guns, were, the, 1, 420, maritime, strike, variants, of, the, north, american, b, 25, mitchell, g, h, which, mounted, either, a, m4, cannon, or, light, weight, t13e1, or, m5, versions, of, the, same, gun, these, weapons, however, were, hand, loaded, had, shorter, barrels, and, or, a, lower, muzzle, velocity, than, the, bk, 7, 5, and, therefore, poorer, armor, penetration, accuracy, and, rate, of, fire, except, for, versions, of, the, piaggio, p, 108, armed, with, a, 102mm, anti, ship, cannon, the, bk, 7, 5, was, unsurpassed, as, an, aircraft, fitted, gun, until, 1971, when, the, four, engine, lockheed, ac, 130, e, spectre, equipped, with, a, 105, mm, m102, howitzer, entered, service, with, the, us, air, force, in, the, immediate, post, war, era, the, piston, engined, ground, attack, aircraft, remained, useful, since, all, of, the, early, jets, lacked, endurance, due, to, the, fuel, consumption, rates, of, the, jet, engines, the, higher, powered, piston, engine, types, that, had, been, too, late, for, world, war, ii, were, still, capable, of, holding, their, own, against, the, jets, as, they, were, able, to, both, out, accelerate, and, out, maneuver, the, jets, the, royal, navy, hawker, sea, fury, fighters, and, the, u, s, vought, f4u, corsair, and, douglas, a, 1, skyraider, were, operated, during, the, korean, war, while, the, latter, continued, to, be, used, throughout, the, vietnam, war, many, post, world, war, ii, era, air, forces, have, been, reluctant, to, adopt, fixed, wing, jet, aircraft, developed, specifically, for, ground, attack, although, close, air, support, and, interdiction, remain, crucial, to, the, modern, battlefield, attack, aircraft, are, less, glamorous, than, fighters, while, air, force, pilots, and, military, planners, have, a, certain, well, cultivated, contempt, for, mud, movers, more, practically, the, cost, of, operating, a, specialized, ground, attack, aircraft, is, harder, to, justify, when, compared, with, multirole, combat, aircraft, jet, attack, aircraft, were, designed, and, employed, during, the, cold, war, era, such, as, the, carrier, based, nuclear, strike, douglas, a, 3, skywarrior, and, north, american, a, 5, vigilante, while, the, grumman, a, 6, intruder, f, 105, thunderchief, f, 111, f, 117, nighthawk, ltv, a, 7, corsair, ii, sukhoi, su, 25, a, 10, thunderbolt, ii, panavia, tornado, amx, dassault, tendard, super, tendard, and, others, were, designed, specifically, for, ground, attack, strike, close, support, and, anti, armor, work, with, little, or, no, air, to, air, capability, ground, attack, has, increasingly, become, a, task, of, converted, trainers, like, the, bae, systems, hawk, or, aero, l, 39, albatros, and, many, trainers, are, built, with, this, task, in, mind, like, the, casa, c, 101, or, the, aermacchi, mb, 339, such, counter, insurgency, aircraft, are, popular, with, air, forces, which, cannot, afford, to, purchase, more, expensive, multirole, aircraft, or, do, not, wish, to, risk, the, few, such, aircraft, they, have, on, light, ground, attack, missions, a, proliferation, of, low, intensity, conflicts, in, the, post, world, war, ii, era, has, also, expanded, need, for, these, types, of, aircraft, to, conduct, counter, insurgency, and, light, ground, attack, operations, a, primary, distinction, of, post, world, war, ii, aviation, between, the, u, s, army, and, the, u, s, air, force, was, that, latter, had, generally, been, allocated, all, fixed, wing, aircraft, while, helicopters, were, under, control, of, the, former, this, was, governed, by, the, 1948, key, west, agreement, the, army, wishing, to, have, its, own, resources, to, support, its, troops, in, combat, and, faced, with, a, lack, of, air, force, enthusiasm, for, the, ground, attack, role, developed, the, dedicated, attack, helicopter, on, 17, january, 1991, task, force, normandy, began, its, attack, on, two, iraqi, anti, aircraft, missile, sites, tf, normandy, under, the, command, of, ltc, richard, a, dick, cody, consisted, of, nine, ah, 64, apaches, one, uh, 60, black, hawk, and, four, air, force, mh, 53j, pave, low, helicopters, the, purpose, of, this, mission, was, to, create, a, safe, corridor, through, the, iraqi, air, defense, system, the, attack, was, a, huge, success, and, cleared, the, way, for, the, beginning, of, the, allied, bombing, campaign, of, operation, desert, storm, one, concern, involving, the, apache, arose, when, a, unit, of, these, helicopters, was, very, slow, to, deploy, during, u, s, military, involvement, in, kosovo, according, to, the, army, times, the, army, is, shifting, its, doctrine, to, favor, ground, attack, aircraft, over, attack, helicopters, for, deep, strike, attack, missions, because, ground, attack, helicopters, have, proved, to, be, highly, vulnerable, to,
