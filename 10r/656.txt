weaving, is, a, method, of, textile, production, in, which, two, distinct, sets, of, yarns, or, threads, are, interlaced, at, right, angles, to, form, a, fabric, or, cloth, other, methods, are, knitting, crocheting, felting, and, braiding, or, plaiting, the, longitudinal, threads, are, called, the, warp, and, the, lateral, threads, are, the, weft, woof, or, filling, the, method, in, which, these, threads, are, interwoven, affects, the, characteristics, of, the, cloth, cloth, is, usually, woven, on, a, loom, a, device, that, holds, the, warp, threads, in, place, while, filling, threads, are, woven, through, them, a, fabric, band, that, meets, this, definition, of, cloth, warp, threads, with, a, weft, thread, winding, between, can, also, be, made, using, other, methods, including, tablet, weaving, back, strap, loom, or, other, techniques, that, can, be, done, without, looms, the, way, the, warp, and, filling, threads, interlace, with, each, other, is, called, the, weave, the, majority, of, woven, products, are, created, with, one, of, three, basic, weaves, plain, weave, satin, weave, or, twill, weave, woven, cloth, can, be, plain, or, classic, in, one, colour, or, a, simple, pattern, or, can, be, woven, in, decorative, or, artistic, design, in, general, weaving, involves, using, a, loom, to, interlace, two, sets, of, threads, at, right, angles, to, each, other, the, warp, which, runs, longitudinally, and, the, weft, older, woof, that, crosses, it, weft, is, an, old, english, word, meaning, that, which, is, woven, compare, leave, and, left, one, warp, thread, is, called, an, end, and, one, weft, thread, is, called, a, pick, the, warp, threads, are, held, taut, and, in, parallel, to, each, other, typically, in, a, loom, there, are, many, types, of, looms, weaving, can, be, summarized, as, a, repetition, of, these, three, actions, also, called, the, primary, motions, of, the, loom, the, warp, is, divided, into, two, overlapping, groups, or, lines, most, often, adjacent, threads, belonging, to, the, opposite, group, that, run, in, two, planes, one, above, another, so, the, shuttle, can, be, passed, between, them, in, a, straight, motion, then, the, upper, group, is, lowered, by, the, loom, mechanism, and, the, lower, group, is, raised, shedding, allowing, the, shuttle, to, pass, in, the, opposite, direction, also, in, a, straight, motion, repeating, these, actions, forms, a, fabric, mesh, but, without, beating, up, the, final, distance, between, the, adjacent, wefts, would, be, irregular, and, far, too, large, the, secondary, motions, of, the, loom, are, the, the, tertiary, motions, of, the, loom, are, the, stop, motions, to, stop, the, loom, in, the, event, of, a, thread, break, the, two, main, stop, motions, are, the, the, principal, parts, of, a, loom, are, the, frame, the, warp, beam, or, weavers, beam, the, cloth, roll, apron, bar, the, heddles, and, their, mounting, the, reed, the, warp, beam, is, a, wooden, or, metal, cylinder, on, the, back, of, the, loom, on, which, the, warp, is, delivered, the, threads, of, the, warp, extend, in, parallel, order, from, the, warp, beam, to, the, front, of, the, loom, where, they, are, attached, to, the, cloth, roll, each, thread, or, group, of, threads, of, the, warp, passes, through, an, opening, eye, in, a, heddle, the, warp, threads, are, separated, by, the, heddles, into, two, or, more, groups, each, controlled, and, automatically, drawn, up, and, down, by, the, motion, of, the, heddles, in, the, case, of, small, patterns, the, movement, of, the, heddles, is, controlled, by, cams, which, move, up, the, heddles, by, means, of, a, frame, called, a, harness, in, larger, patterns, the, heddles, are, controlled, by, a, dobby, mechanism, where, the, healds, are, raised, according, to, pegs, inserted, into, a, revolving, drum, where, a, complex, design, is, required, the, healds, are, raised, by, harness, cords, attached, to, a, jacquard, machine, every, time, the, harness, the, heddles, moves, up, or, down, an, opening, shed, is, made, between, the, threads, of, warp, through, which, the, pick, is, inserted, traditionally, the, weft, thread, is, inserted, by, a, shuttle, on, a, conventional, loom, continuous, weft, thread, is, carried, on, a, pirn, in, a, shuttle, that, passes, through, the, shed, a, handloom, weaver, could, propel, the, shuttle, by, throwing, it, from, side, to, side, with, the, aid, of, a, picking, stick, the, picking, on, a, power, loom, is, done, by, rapidly, hitting, the, shuttle, from, each, side, using, an, overpick, or, underpick, mechanism, controlled, by, cams, 80, 250, times, a, minute, when, a, pirn, is, depleted, it, is, ejected, from, the, shuttle, and, replaced, with, the, next, pirn, held, in, a, battery, attached, to, the, loom, multiple, shuttle, boxes, allow, more, than, one, shuttle, to, be, used, each, can, carry, a, different, colour, which, allows, banding, across, the, loom, the, rapier, type, weaving, machines, do, not, have, shuttles, they, propel, cut, lengths, of, weft, by, means, of, small, grippers, or, rapiers, that, pick, up, the, filling, thread, and, carry, it, halfway, across, the, loom, where, another, rapier, picks, it, up, and, pulls, it, the, rest, of, the, way, some, carry, the, filling, yarns, across, the, loom, at, rates, in, excess, of, 2, 000, metres, per, minute, manufacturers, such, as, picanol, have, reduced, the, mechanical, adjustments, to, a, minimum, and, control, all, the, functions, through, a, computer, with, a, graphical, user, interface, other, types, use, compressed, air, to, insert, the, pick, they, are, all, fast, versatile, and, quiet, the, warp, is, sized, in, a, starch, mixture, for, smoother, running, the, loom, warped, loomed, or, dressed, by, passing, the, sized, warp, threads, through, two, or, more, heddles, attached, to, harnesses, the, power, weavers, loom, is, warped, by, separate, workers, most, looms, used, for, industrial, purposes, have, a, machine, that, ties, new, warps, threads, to, the, waste, of, previously, used, warps, threads, while, still, on, the, loom, then, an, operator, rolls, the, old, and, new, threads, back, on, the, warp, beam, the, harnesses, are, controlled, by, cams, dobbies, or, a, jacquard, head, the, raising, and, lowering, sequence, of, warp, threads, in, various, sequences, gives, rise, to, many, possible, weave, structures, both, warp, and, weft, can, be, visible, in, the, final, product, by, spacing, the, warp, more, closely, it, can, completely, cover, the, weft, that, binds, it, giving, a, warp, faced, textile, such, as, rep, weave, conversely, if, the, warp, is, spread, out, the, weft, can, slide, down, and, completely, cover, the, warp, giving, a, weft, faced, textile, such, as, a, tapestry, or, a, kilim, rug, there, are, a, variety, of, loom, styles, for, hand, weaving, and, tapestry, there, are, some, indications, that, weaving, was, already, known, in, the, paleolithic, era, as, early, as, 27, 000, years, ago, an, indistinct, textile, impression, has, been, found, at, the, doln, v, stonice, site, according, to, the, find, the, weavers, of, the, upper, palaeolithic, were, manufacturing, a, variety, of, cordage, types, produced, plaited, basketry, and, sophisticated, twined, and, plain, woven, cloth, the, artifacts, include, imprints, in, clay, and, burned, remnants, of, cloth, the, oldest, known, textiles, found, in, the, americas, are, remnants, of, six, finely, woven, textiles, and, cordage, found, in, guitarrero, cave, peru, the, weavings, made, from, plant, fibres, are, dated, between, 10, 100, and, 9080, bce, in, 2013, a, piece, of, cloth, woven, from, hemp, was, found, in, burial, f, 7121, at, the, atalh, y, k, site, suggested, to, be, from, around, 7000, bce, further, finds, come, from, the, neolithic, civilisation, preserved, in, the, pile, dwellings, in, switzerland, another, extant, fragment, from, the, neolithic, was, found, in, fayum, at, a, site, dated, to, about, 5000, bce, this, fragment, is, woven, at, about, 12, threads, by, 9, threads, per, centimetre, in, a, plain, weave, flax, was, the, predominant, fibre, in, egypt, at, this, time, 3600, bce, and, had, continued, popularity, in, the, nile, valley, though, wool, became, the, primary, fibre, used, in, other, cultures, around, 2000, bce, the, oldest, known, weavings, in, north, america, come, from, the, windover, archaeological, site, in, florida, dating, from, 4900, to, 6500, bce, and, made, from, plant, fibres, the, windover, hunter, gatherers, produced, finely, crafted, twined, and, plain, weave, textiles, eighty, seven, pieces, of, fabric, were, found, associated, with, 37, burials, researchers, have, identified, seven, different, weaves, in, the, fabric, one, kind, of, fabric, had, 26, strands, per, inch, 10, strands, per, centimetre, there, were, also, weaves, using, two, strand, and, three, strand, wefts, a, round, bag, made, from, twine, was, found, as, well, as, matting, the, yarn, was, probably, made, from, palm, leaves, cabbage, palm, saw, palmetto, and, scrub, palmetto, are, all, common, in, the, area, and, would, have, been, so, 8, 000, years, ago, evidence, of, weaving, as, a, commercial, household, industry, in, the, historical, region, of, macedonia, has, been, found, at, the, olynthus, site, when, the, city, was, destroyed, by, philip, ii, in, 348, bce, artifacts, were, preserved, in, the, houses, loomweights, were, found, in, many, houses, enough, to, produce, cloth, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, household, but, some, of, the, houses, contained, more, loomweights, enough, for, commercial, production, and, one, of, the, houses, was, adjacent, to, the, agora, and, contained, three, shops, where, many, coins, were, found, it, is, probable, that, such, homes, were, engaged, in, commercial, textile, manufacture, weaving, was, known, in, all, the, great, civilisations, but, no, clear, line, of, causality, has, been, established, early, looms, required, two, people, to, create, the, shed, and, one, person, to, pass, through, the, filling, early, looms, wove, a, fixed, length, of, cloth, but, later, ones, allowed, warp, to, be, wound, out, as, the, fell, progressed, weaving, became, simpler, when, the, warp, was, sized, around, the, 4th, century, bce, the, cultivation, of, cotton, and, the, knowledge, of, its, spinning, and, weaving, in, mero, reached, a, high, level, export, of, textiles, was, one, of, the, main, sources, of, wealth, for, kush, aksumite, king, ezana, boasted, in, his, inscription, that, he, destroyed, large, cotton, plantations, in, mero, during, his, conquest, of, the, region, the, indigenous, people, of, the, americas, wove, textiles, of, cotton, throughout, tropical, and, subtropical, america, and, in, the, south, american, andes, of, wool, from, camelids, primarily, domesticated, llamas, and, alpacas, cotton, and, the, camelids, were, both, domesticated, by, about, 4, 000, bce, american, weavers, are, credited, with, independently, inventing, nearly, every, non, mechanized, technique, known, today, in, the, inca, empire, of, the, andes, both, men, and, women, produced, textiles, women, mostly, did, their, weaving, using, backstrap, looms, to, make, small, pieces, of, cloth, and, vertical, frame, and, single, heddle, looms, for, larger, pieces, men, used, upright, looms, the, inca, elite, valued, cumbi, which, was, a, fine, tapestry, woven, textile, produced, on, upright, looms, the, elite, often, offered, cumbi, as, gifts, of, reciprocity, to, lords, other, elite, in, the, empire, in, regions, under, direct, control, of, the, inca, special, artisans, produced, cumbi, for, the, elite, women, who, created, cumbi, in, these, regions, were, called, acllas, or, mamaconas, and, men, were, called, cumbicamayos, andean, textile, weavings, were, of, practical, symbolic, religious, and, ceremonial, importance, and, used, as, currency, tribute, and, as, a, determinant, of, social, class, and, rank, sixteenth, century, spanish, colonists, were, impressed, by, both, the, quality, and, quantity, of, textiles, produced, by, the, inca, empire, some, of, the, techniques, and, designs, are, still, in, use, in, the, 21st, century, whereas, european, cloth, making, generally, created, ornamentation, through, suprastructural, means, by, adding, embroidery, ribbons, brocade, dyeing, and, other, elements, onto, the, finished, woven, textile, pre, columbian, andean, weavers, created, elaborate, cloth, by, focusing, on, structural, designs, involving, manipulation, of, the, warp, and, weft, of, the, fabric, itself, andeans, used, tapestry, techniques, double, triple, and, quadruple, cloth, techniques, gauze, weaves, warp, patterned, weaves, discontinuous, warp, or, scaffold, weaves, and, plain, weaves, among, many, other, techniques, in, addition, to, the, suprastructural, techniques, listed, above, the, weaving, of, silk, from, silkworm, cocoons, has, been, known, in, china, since, about, 3500, bce, silk, that, was, intricately, woven, and, dyed, showing, a, well, developed, craft, has, been, found, in, a, chinese, tomb, dating, back, to, 2700, bce, silk, weaving, in, china, was, an, intricate, process, that, was, very, involved, men, and, women, usually, from, the, same, family, had, their, own, roles, in, the, weaving, process, the, actual, work, of, weaving, was, done, by, both, men, and, women, women, were, often, weavers, since, it, was, a, way, they, could, contribute, to, the, household, income, while, staying, at, home, women, would, usually, weave, simpler, designs, within, the, household, while, men, would, be, in, charge, of, the, weaving, of, more, intricate, and, complex, pieces, of, clothing, the, process, of, sericulture, and, weaving, emphasized, the, idea, that, men, and, women, should, work, together, instead, of, women, being, subordinate, to, men, weaving, became, an, integral, part, of, chinese, women, s, social, identity, several, rituals, and, myths, were, associated, with, the, promotion, of, silk, weaving, especially, as, a, symbol, of, female, power, weaving, contributed, to, the, balance, between, men, and, women, s, economic, contributions, and, had, many, economic, benefits, there, were, many, paths, into, the, occupation, of, weaver, women, usually, married, into, the, occupation, belonged, to, a, family, of, weavers, and, or, lived, in, a, location, that, had, ample, weather, conditions, that, allowed, for, the, process, of, silk, weaving, weavers, usually, belonged, to, the, peasant, class, silk, weaving, became, a, specialized, job, requiring, specific, technology, and, equipment, that, was, completed, domestically, within, households, although, most, of, the, silk, weaving, was, done, within, the, confines, of, the, home, and, family, there, were, some, specialized, workshops, that, hired, skilled, silk, weavers, as, well, these, workshops, took, care, of, the, weaving, process, although, the, raising, of, the, silkworms, and, reeling, of, the, silk, remained, work, for, peasant, families, the, silk, that, was, woven, in, workshops, rather, than, homes, were, of, higher, quality, since, the, workshop, could, afford, to, hire, the, best, weavers, these, weavers, were, usually, men, who, operated, more, complicated, looms, such, as, the, wooden, draw, loom, this, created, a, competitive, market, of, silk, weavers, the, quality, and, ease, of, the, weaving, process, depended, on, the, silk, that, was, produced, by, the, silk, worms, the, easiest, silk, to, work, with, came, from, breeds, of, silk, worms, that, spun, their, cocoons, so, that, it, could, be, unwound, in, one, long, strand, the, reeling, or, unwinding, of, silk, worm, cocoons, is, started, by, placing, the, cocoons, in, boiling, water, in, order, to, break, apart, the, silk, filaments, as, well, as, kill, the, silk, worm, pupae, women, would, then, find, the, end, of, the, strands, of, silk, by, sticking, their, hand, into, the, boiling, water, usually, this, task, was, done, by, girls, aged, eight, to, twelve, while, the, more, complex, jobs, were, given, to, older, women, they, would, then, create, a, silk, thread, which, could, vary, in, thickness, and, strength, from, the, unwound, cocoons, after, the, reeling, of, the, silk, the, silk, would, be, dyed, before, the, weaving, process, began, there, were, many, different, looms, and, tools, for, weaving, for, high, quality, and, intricate, designs, a, wooden, draw, loom, or, pattern, loom, was, used, this, loom, would, require, two, or, three, weavers, and, was, usually, operated, by, men, there, were, also, other, smaller, looms, such, as, the, waist, loom, that, could, be, operated, by, a, single, woman, and, were, usually, used, domestically, sericulture, and, silk, weaving, spread, to, korea, by, 200, bce, to, khotan, by, 50, ce, and, to, japan, by, about, 300, ce, the, pit, treadle, loom, may, have, originated, in, india, though, most, authorities, establish, the, invention, in, china, pedals, were, added, to, operate, heddles, by, the, middle, ages, such, devices, also, appeared, in, persia, sudan, egypt, and, possibly, the, arabian, peninsula, where, the, operator, sat, with, his, feet, in, a, pit, below, a, fairly, low, slung, loom, in, 700, ce, horizontal, looms, and, vertical, looms, could, be, found, in, many, parts, of, asia, africa, and, europe, in, africa, the, rich, dressed, in, cotton, while, the, poorer, wore, wool, by, the, 12th, century, it, had, come, to, europe, either, from, the, byzantium, or, moorish, spain, where, the, mechanism, was, raised, higher, above, the, ground, on, a, more, substantial, frame, in, the, philippines, numerous, pre, colonial, weaving, traditions, exist, among, different, ethnic, groups, they, used, various, plant, fibers, mainly, abac, or, banana, but, also, including, tree, cotton, buri, palm, locally, known, as, buntal, and, other, palms, various, grasses, like, amumuting, and, tikog, and, barkcloth, the, oldest, evidence, of, weaving, traditions, are, neolithic, stone, tools, used, for, preparing, barkcloth, found, in, archeological, sites, in, sagung, cave, of, southern, palawan, and, arku, cave, of, pe, ablanca, cagayan, the, latter, has, been, dated, to, around, 1255, 605, bce, the, predominant, fibre, in, europe, during, the, medieval, period, was, wool, followed, by, linen, and, nettlecloth, for, the, lower, classes, cotton, was, introduced, to, sicily, and, spain, in, the, 9th, century, when, sicily, was, captured, by, the, normans, they, took, the, technology, to, northern, italy, and, then, the, rest, of, europe, silk, fabric, production, was, reintroduced, towards, the, end, of, this, period, and, the, more, sophisticated, silk, weaving, techniques, were, applied, to, the, other, staples, the, weaver, worked, at, home, and, marketed, his, cloth, at, fairs, warp, weighted, looms, were, commonplace, in, europe, before, the, introduction, of, horizontal, looms, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, weaving, became, an, urban, craft, and, to, regulate, their, trade, craftsmen, applied, to, establish, a, guild, these, initially, were, merchant, guilds, but, developed, into, separate, trade, guilds, for, each, skill, the, cloth, merchant, who, was, a, member, of, a, city, s, weavers, guild, was, allowed, to, sell, cloth, he, acted, as, a, middleman, between, the, tradesmen, weavers, and, the, purchaser, the, trade, guilds, controlled, quality, and, the, training, needed, before, an, artisan, could, call, himself, a, weaver, by, the, 13th, century, an, organisational, change, took, place, and, a, system, of, putting, out, was, introduced, the, cloth, merchant, purchased, the, wool, and, provided, it, to, the, weaver, who, sold, his, produce, back, to, the, merchant, the, merchant, controlled, the, rates, of, pay, and, economically, dominated, the, cloth, industry, the, merchants, prosperity, is, reflected, in, the, wool, towns, of, eastern, england, norwich, bury, st, edmunds, and, lavenham, being, good, examples, wool, was, a, political, issue, the, supply, of, thread, has, always, limited, the, output, of, a, weaver, about, that, time, the, spindle, method, of, spinning, was, replaced, by, the, great, wheel, and, soon, after, the, treadle, driven, spinning, wheel, the, loom, remained, the, same, but, with, the, increased, volume, of, thread, it, could, be, operated, continuously, the, 14th, century, saw, considerable, flux, in, population, the, 13th, century, had, been, a, period, of, relative, peace, europe, became, overpopulated, poor, weather, led, to, a, series, of, poor, harvests, and, starvation, there, was, great, loss, of, life, in, the, hundred, years, war, then, in, 1346, europe, was, struck, with, the, black, death, and, the, population, was, reduced, by, up, to, a, half, arable, land, was, labour, intensive, and, sufficient, workers, no, longer, could, be, found, land, prices, dropped, and, land, was, sold, and, put, to, sheep, pasture, traders, from, florence, and, bruges, bought, the, wool, then, sheep, owning, landlords, started, to, weave, wool, outside, the, jurisdiction, of, the, city, and, trade, guilds, the, weavers, started, by, working, in, their, own, homes, then, production, was, moved, into, purpose, built, buildings, the, working, hours, and, the, amount, of, work, were, regulated, the, putting, out, system, had, been, replaced, by, a, factory, system, the, migration, of, the, huguenot, weavers, calvinists, fleeing, from, religious, persecution, in, mainland, europe, to, britain, around, the, time, of, 1685, challenged, the, english, weavers, of, cotton, woollen, and, worsted, cloth, who, subsequently, learned, the, huguenots, superior, techniques, colonial, america, relied, heavily, on, great, britain, for, manufactured, goods, of, all, kinds, british, policy, was, to, encourage, the, production, of, raw, materials, in, colonies, and, discourage, manufacturing, the, wool, act, 1699, restricted, the, export, of, colonial, wool, as, a, result, many, people, wove, cloth, from, locally, produced, fibres, the, colonists, also, used, wool, cotton, and, flax, linen, for, weaving, though, hemp, could, be, made, into, serviceable, canvas, and, heavy, cloth, they, could, get, one, cotton, crop, each, year, until, the, invention, of, the, cotton, gin, it, was, a, labour, intensive, process, to, separate, the, seeds, from, the, fibres, functional, tape, bands, straps, and, fringe, were, woven, on, box, and, paddle, looms, a, plain, weave, was, preferred, as, the, added, skill, and, time, required, to, make, more, complex, weaves, kept, them, from, common, use, sometimes, designs, were, woven, into, the, fabric, but, most, were, added, after, weaving, using, wood, block, prints, or, embroidery, before, the, industrial, revolution, weaving, was, a, manual, craft, and, wool, was, the, principal, staple, in, the, great, wool, districts, a, form, of, factory, system, had, been, introduced, but, in, the, uplands, weavers, worked, from, home, on, a, putting, out, system, the, wooden, looms, of, that, time, might, be, broad, or, narrow, broad, looms, were, those, too, wide, for, the, weaver, to, pass, the, shuttle, through, the, shed, so, that, the, weaver, needed, an, expensive, assistant, often, an, apprentice, this, ceased, to, be, necessary, after, john, kay, invented, the, flying, shuttle, in, 1733, the, shuttle, and, the, picking, stick, sped, up, the, process, of, weaving, there, was, thus, a, shortage, of, thread, or, a, surplus, of, weaving, capacity, the, opening, of, the, bridgewater, canal, in, june, 1761, allowed, cotton, to, be, brought, into, manchester, an, area, rich, in, fast, flowing, streams, that, could, be, used, to, power, machinery, spinning, was, the, first, to, be, mechanised, spinning, jenny, spinning, mule, and, this, led, to, limitless, thread, for, the, weaver, edmund, cartwright, first, proposed, building, a, weaving, machine, that, would, function, similar, to, recently, developed, cotton, spinning, mills, in, 1784, drawing, scorn, from, critics, who, said, the, weaving, process, was, too, nuanced, to, automate, he, built, a, factory, at, doncaster, and, obtained, a, series, of, patents, between, 1785, and, 1792, in, 1788, his, brother, major, john, cartwight, built, revolution, mill, at, retford, named, for, the, centenary, of, the, glorious, revolution, in, 1791, he, licensed, his, loom, to, the, grimshaw, brothers, of, manchester, but, their, knott, mill, burnt, down, the, following, year, possibly, a, case, of, arson, edmund, cartwight, was, granted, a, reward, of, 10, 000, by, parliament, for, his, efforts, in, 1809, however, success, in, power, weaving, also, required, improvements, by, others, including, h, horrocks, of, stockport, only, during, the, two, decades, after, about, 1805, did, power, weaving, take, hold, at, that, time, there, were, 250, 000, hand, weavers, in, the, uk, textile, manufacture, was, one, of, the, leading, sectors, in, the, british, industrial, revolution, but, weaving, was, a, comparatively, late, sector, to, be, mechanised, the, loom, became, semi, automatic, in, 1842, with, kenworthy, and, bulloughs, lancashire, loom, the, various, innovations, took, weaving, from, a, home, based, artisan, activity, labour, intensive, and, man, powered, to, steam, driven, factories, process, a, large, metal, manufacturing, industry, grew, to, produce, the, looms, firms, such, as, howard, bullough, of, accrington, and, tweedales, and, smalley, and, platt, brothers, most, power, weaving, took, place, in, weaving, sheds, in, small, towns, circling, greater, manchester, away, from, the, cotton, spinning, area, the, earlier, combination, mills, where, spinning, and, weaving, took, place, in, adjacent, buildings, became, rarer, wool, and, worsted, weaving, took, place, in, west, yorkshire, and, particular, bradford, here, there, were, large, factories, such, as, lister, s, or, drummond, s, where, all, the, processes, took, place, both, men, and, women, with, weaving, skills, emigrated, and, took, the, knowledge, to, their, new, homes, in, new, england, to, places, like, pawtucket, and, lowell, woven, grey, cloth, was, then, sent, to, the, finishers, where, it, was, bleached, dyed, and, printed, natural, dyes, were, originally, used, with, synthetic, dyes, coming, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, a, demand, for, new, dyes, followed, the, discovery, of, mauveine, in, 1856, and, its, popularity, in, fashion, researchers, continued, to, explore, the, chemical, potential, of, coal, tar, waste, from, the, growing, number, of, gas, works, in, britain, and, europe, creating, an, entirely, new, sector, in, the, chemical, industry, the, invention, in, france, of, the, jacquard, loom, patented, in, 1804, enabled, complicated, patterned, cloths, to, be, woven, by, using, punched, cards, to, determine, which, threads, of, coloured, yarn, should, appear, on, the, upper, side, of, the, cloth, the, jacquard, allowed, individual, control, of, each, warp, thread, row, by, row, without, repeating, so, very, complex, patterns, were, suddenly, feasible, samples, exist, showing, calligraphy, and, woven, copies, of, engravings, jacquards, could, be, attached, to, handlooms, or, powerlooms, a, distinction, can, be, made, between, the, role, and, lifestyle, and, status, of, a, handloom, weaver, and, that, of, the, power, loom, weaver, and, craft, weaver, the, perceived, threat, of, the, power, loom, led, to, disquiet, and, industrial, unrest, well, known, protests, movements, such, as, the, luddites, and, the, chartists, had, handloom, weavers, amongst, their, leaders, in, the, early, 19th, century, power, weaving, became, viable, richard, guest, in, 1823, made, a, comparison, of, the, productivity, of, power, and, handloom, weavers, a, very, good, hand, weaver, a, man, twenty, five, or, thirty, years, of, age, will, weave, two, pieces, of, nine, eighths, shirting, per, week, each, twenty, four, yards, long, and, containing, one, hundred, and, five, shoots, of, weft, in, an, inch, the, reed, of, the, cloth, being, a, forty, four, bolton, count, and, the, warp, and, weft, forty, hanks, to, the, pound, a, steam, loom, weaver, fifteen, years, of, age, will, in, the, same, time, weave, seven, similar, pieces, he, then, speculates, about, the, wider, economics, of, using, power, loom, weavers, it, may, very, safely, be, said, that, the, work, is, done, in, a, steam, factory, containing, two, hundred, looms, would, if, done, by, hand, weavers, find, employment, and, support, for, a, population, of, more, than, two, thousand, persons, with, the, industrial, revolution, came, a, growth, in, opportunity, for, women, to, work, within, textile, factories, however, in, spite, of, their, gender, their, work, was, perceived, to, have, a, lower, social, and, economic, value, than, work, done, by, their, male, counterparts, in, the, 1920s, the, weaving, workshop, of, the, bauhaus, design, school, in, germany, aimed, to, raise, weaving, previously, seen, as, a, craft, to, a, fine, art, and, also, to, investigate, the, industrial, requirements, of, modern, weaving, and, fabrics, under, the, direction, of, gunta, st, lzl, the, workshop, experimented, with, unorthodox, materials, including, cellophane, fibreglass, and, metal, from, expressionist, tapestries, to, the, development, of, soundproofing, and, light, reflective, fabric, the, workshop, s, innovative, approach, instigated, a, modernist, theory, of, weaving, former, bauhaus, student, and, teacher, anni, albers, published, the, seminal, 20th, century, text, on, weaving, in, 1965, other, notables, from, the, bauhaus, weaving, workshop, include, otti, berger, margaretha, reichardt, and, benita, koch, otte, in, the, bauhaus, the, weaving, workshop, was, considered, the, women, s, department, and, many, women, were, forced, to, join, against, wishes, to, study, another, art, form, some, weavers, like, helene, nonn, schmidt, believed, that, women, were, made, to, weave, because, they, could, only, produce, work, in, 2, d, she, thought, women, lacked, the, spatial, imagination, and, genius, men, had, to, work, in, other, mediums, hand, weaving,

such, as, in, the, cotton, famine, regular, income, they, were, paid, a, wage, and, a, piece, work, bonus, even, when, working, in, a, combined, mill, weavers, stuck, together, and, enjoyed, a, tight, knit, community, the, women, usually, minded, the, four, machines, and, kept, the, looms, oiled, and, clean, they, were, assisted, by, little, tenters, children, on, a, fixed, wage, who, ran, errands, and, did, small, tasks, they, learnt, the, job, of, the, weaver, by, watching, often, they, would, be, half, timers, carrying, a, green, card, which, teacher, and, overlookers, would, sign, to, say, they, had, turned, up, at, the, mill, in, the, morning, and, the, afternoon, at, the, school, at, fourteen, or, so, they, come, full, time, into, the, mill, and, started, by, sharing, looms, with, an, experienced, worker, where, it, was, important, to, learn, quickly, as, they, would, both, be, on, piece, work, serious, problems, with, the, loom, were, left, to, the, tackler, to, sort, out, he,

has, been, a, hierarchy, between, artists, who, were, considered, craftspeople, and, artists, who, worked, in, traditional, mediums, of, painting, and, sculpture, the, traditional, artists, wanted, to, keep, artisans, in, the, minority, so, there, was, little, reception, for, arts, that, were, considered, craft, in, 1939, art, critic, clement, greenberg, wrote, avant, garde, and, kitsch, where,

with, femininity, in, the, early, 1900s, by, critics, like, adolf, loos, and, karl, scheffler, although, greenberg, never, explicitly, says, the, word, craft, many, scholars, postulate, that, this, is, one, of, the, origins, of, western, opposition, to, weaving, and, more, largely, art, that, is, considered, craft, only, recently, has, the, art, world, begun, to, recognize, weaving, as, an, art,
