sewing, is, the, craft, of, fastening, or, attaching, objects, using, stitches, made, with, a, sewing, needle, and, thread, sewing, is, one, of, the, oldest, of, the, textile, arts, arising, in, the, paleolithic, era, before, the, invention, of, spinning, yarn, or, weaving, fabric, archaeologists, believe, stone, age, people, across, europe, and, asia, sewed, fur, and, leather, clothing, using, bone, antler, or, ivory, sewing, needles, and, thread, made, of, various, animal, body, parts, including, sinew, catgut, and, veins, for, thousands, of, years, all, sewing, was, done, by, hand, the, invention, of, the, sewing, machine, in, the, 19th, century, and, the, rise, of, computerization, in, the, 20th, century, led, to, mass, production, and, export, of, sewn, objects, but, hand, sewing, is, still, practiced, around, the, world, fine, hand, sewing, is, a, characteristic, of, high, quality, tailoring, haute, couture, fashion, and, custom, dressmaking, and, is, pursued, by, both, textile, artists, and, hobbyists, as, a, means, of, creative, expression, the, first, known, use, of, the, word, sewing, was, in, the, 14th, century, sewing, has, an, ancient, history, estimated, to, begin, during, the, paleolithic, era, sewing, was, used, to, stitch, together, animal, hides, for, clothing, and, for, shelter, the, inuit, for, example, used, sinew, from, caribou, for, thread, and, needles, made, of, bone, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, american, plains, and, canadian, prairies, used, sophisticated, sewing, methods, to, assemble, tipi, shelters, sewing, was, combined, with, the, weaving, of, plant, leaves, in, africa, to, create, baskets, such, as, those, made, by, zulu, weavers, who, used, thin, strips, of, palm, leaf, as, thread, to, stitch, wider, strips, of, palm, leaf, that, had, been, woven, into, a, coil, the, weaving, of, cloth, from, natural, fibers, originated, in, the, middle, east, around, 4000, bc, and, perhaps, earlier, during, the, neolithic, age, and, the, sewing, of, cloth, accompanied, this, development, during, the, middle, ages, europeans, who, could, afford, it, employed, seamstresses, and, tailors, the, vital, importance, of, sewing, was, indicated, by, the, honorific, position, of, lord, sewer, at, many, european, coronations, from, the, middle, ages, an, example, was, robert, radcliffe, 1st, earl, of, sussex, who, was, appointed, lord, sewer, at, the, coronation, of, henry, viii, of, england, in, 1509, sewing, for, the, most, part, was, a, woman, s, occupation, and, most, sewing, before, the, 19th, century, was, practical, clothing, was, an, expensive, investment, for, most, people, and, women, had, an, important, role, in, extending, the, longevity, of, items, of, clothing, sewing, was, used, for, mending, clothing, that, was, faded, would, be, turned, inside, out, so, that, it, could, continue, to, be, worn, and, sometimes, had, to, be, taken, apart, and, reassembled, to, suit, this, purpose, once, clothing, became, worn, or, torn, it, would, be, taken, apart, and, the, reusable, cloth, sewn, together, into, new, items, of, clothing, made, into, quilts, or, otherwise, put, to, practical, use, the, many, steps, involved, in, making, clothing, from, scratch, weaving, pattern, making, cutting, alterations, and, so, forth, meant, that, women, often, bartered, their, expertise, in, a, particular, skill, with, one, another, decorative, needlework, such, as, embroidery, was, a, valued, skill, and, young, women, with, the, time, and, means, would, practice, to, build, their, skill, in, this, area, from, the, middle, ages, to, the, 17th, century, sewing, tools, such, as, needles, pins, and, pincushions, were, included, in, the, trousseaus, of, many, european, brides, sewing, birds, or, sewing, clamps, were, used, as, a, third, hand, and, were, popular, gifts, for, seamstresses, in, the, 19th, century, decorative, embroidery, was, valued, in, many, cultures, worldwide, although, most, embroidery, stitches, in, the, western, repertoire, are, traditionally, british, irish, or, western, european, in, origin, stitches, originating, in, different, cultures, are, known, throughout, the, world, today, some, examples, are, the, cretan, open, filling, stitch, romanian, couching, or, oriental, couching, and, the, japanese, stitch, the, stitches, associated, with, embroidery, spread, by, way, of, the, trade, routes, that, were, active, during, the, middle, ages, the, silk, road, brought, chinese, embroidery, techniques, to, western, asia, and, eastern, europe, while, techniques, originating, in, the, middle, east, spread, to, southern, and, western, europe, through, morocco, and, spain, european, imperial, settlements, also, spread, embroidery, and, sewing, techniques, worldwide, however, there, are, instances, of, sewing, techniques, indigenous, to, cultures, in, distant, locations, from, one, another, where, cross, cultural, communication, would, have, been, historically, unlikely, for, example, a, method, of, reverse, appliqu, known, to, areas, of, south, america, is, also, known, to, southeast, asia, the, industrial, revolution, shifted, the, production, of, textiles, from, the, household, to, the, mills, in, the, early, decades, of, the, industrial, revolution, the, machinery, produced, whole, cloth, the, world, s, first, sewing, machine, was, patented, in, 1790, by, thomas, saint, by, the, early, 1840s, other, early, sewing, machines, began, to, appear, barth, lemy, thimonnier, introduced, a, simple, sewing, machine, in, 1841, to, produce, military, uniforms, for, france, s, army, shortly, afterward, a, mob, of, tailors, broke, into, thimonnier, s, shop, and, threw, the, machines, out, of, the, windows, believing, the, machines, would, put, them, out, of, work, by, the, 1850s, isaac, singer, developed, the, first, sewing, machines, that, could, operate, quickly, and, accurately, and, surpass, the, productivity, of, a, seamstress, or, tailor, sewing, by, hand, while, much, clothing, was, still, produced, at, home, by, female, members, of, the, family, more, and, more, ready, made, clothes, for, the, middle, classes, were, being, produced, with, sewing, machines, textile, sweatshops, full, of, poorly, paid, sewing, machine, operators, grew, into, entire, business, districts, in, large, cities, like, london, and, new, york, city, to, further, support, the, industry, piece, work, was, done, for, little, money, by, women, living, in, slums, needlework, was, one, of, the, few, occupations, considered, acceptable, for, women, but, it, did, not, pay, a, living, wage, women, working, from, home, often, worked, 14, hour, days, to, earn, enough, to, support, themselves, sometimes, by, renting, sewing, machines, that, they, could, not, afford, to, buy, tailors, became, associated, with, higher, end, clothing, during, this, period, in, london, this, status, grew, out, of, the, dandy, trend, of, the, early, 19th, century, when, new, tailor, shops, were, established, around, savile, row, these, shops, acquired, a, reputation, for, sewing, high, quality, handmade, clothing, in, the, style, of, the, latest, british, fashions, as, well, as, more, classic, styles, the, boutique, culture, of, carnaby, street, was, absorbed, by, savile, row, tailors, during, the, late, 20th, century, ensuring, the, continued, flourishing, of, savile, row, s, businesses, sewing, underwent, further, developments, during, the, 20th, century, as, sewing, machines, became, more, affordable, to, the, working, class, demand, for, sewing, patterns, grew, women, had, become, accustomed, to, seeing, the, latest, fashions, in, periodicals, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, increasing, demand, for, sewing, patterns, yet, more, american, tailor, and, manufacturer, ebenezer, butterick, met, the, demand, with, paper, patterns, that, could, be, traced, and, used, by, home, sewers, the, patterns, sold, in, small, packets, became, wildly, popular, several, pattern, companies, soon, established, themselves, women, s, magazines, also, carried, sewing, patterns, and, continued, to, do, so, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, this, practice, declined, during, the, later, decades, of, the, 20th, century, when, ready, made, clothing, became, a, necessity, as, women, joined, the, paid, workforce, in, larger, numbers, leaving, them, with, less, time, to, sew, if, indeed, they, had, an, interest, today, the, low, price, of, ready, made, clothing, in, shops, means, that, home, sewing, is, confined, largely, to, hobbyists, in, western, countries, with, the, exception, of, cottage, industries, in, custom, dressmaking, and, upholstery, sewing, as, a, pleasurable, hobby, has, gained, popularity, as, attested, by, the, bbc, televisions, show, the, great, british, sewing, bee, on, air, since, 2013, the, spread, of, sewing, machine, technology, to, industrialized, economies, around, the, world, meant, the, spread, of, western, style, sewing, methods, and, clothing, styles, as, well, in, japan, traditional, clothing, was, sewn, together, with, running, stitch, that, could, be, removed, so, that, the, clothing, could, be, taken, apart, and, the, assorted, pieces, laundered, separately, the, tight, locked, stitches, made, by, home, sewing, machines, and, the, use, of, western, clothing, patterns, led, to, a, movement, towards, wearing, western, style, clothing, during, the, early, 20th, century, western, sewing, and, clothing, styles, were, disseminated, in, sub, saharan, africa, by, christian, missionaries, from, the, 1830s, onward, indigenous, cultures, such, as, the, zulu, and, tswana, were, indoctrinated, in, the, western, way, of, dress, as, a, sign, of, conversion, to, christianity, first, western, hand, sewing, techniques, and, later, machine, sewing, spread, throughout, the, regions, where, the, european, colonists, settled, however, a, recent, examination, of, new, online, learning, methods, demonstrated, that, technology, can, be, adapted, to, share, knowledge, of, a, culture, s, traditional, sewing, methods, using, self, paced, online, tutorials, a, malay, sewing, class, learned, how, to, tailor, and, sew, a, traditional, men, s, baju, kurung, garment, in, 3, days, whereas, a, traditional, malay, sewing, class, would, have, taken, 5, days, to, teach, the, same, information, advances, in, industrial, technology, such, as, the, development, of, synthetic, fibres, during, the, early, 20th, century, have, brought, profound, changes, to, the, textile, industry, as, a, whole, textile, industries, in, western, countries, have, declined, sharply, as, textile, companies, compete, for, cheaper, labour, in, other, parts, of, the, world, according, to, the, u, s, department, of, labor, employment, of, sewers, and, tailors, is, expected, to, experience, little, or, no, change, growing, 1, percent, from, 2010, to, 2020, it, is, estimated, that, every, lost, textile, job, in, a, western, country, in, recent, years, has, resulted, in, 1, 5, jobs, being, created, in, an, outsourced, country, such, as, china, textile, workers, who, perform, tasks, with, sewing, machines, or, do, detailed, work, by, hand, are, still, a, vital, component, of, the, industry, however, small, scale, sewing, is, also, an, economic, standby, in, many, developing, countries, where, many, people, both, male, and, female, are, self, employed, sewers, garment, construction, is, usually, guided, by, a, sewing, pattern, a, pattern, can, be, quite, simple, some, patterns, are, nothing, more, than, a, mathematical, formula, that, the, sewer, calculates, based, on, the, intended, wearer, s, measurements, once, calculated, the, sewer, has, the, measurements, needed, to, cut, the, cloth, and, sew, the, garment, together, at, the, other, end, of, the, spectrum, are, haute, couture, fashion, designs, when, a, couture, garment, is, made, of, unusual, material, or, has, extreme, proportions, the, design, may, challenge, the, sewer, s, engineering, knowledge, complex, designs, are, drafted, and, refitted, dozens, of, times, may, take, around, 40, hours, to, develop, a, final, pattern, and, require, 60, hours, of, cutting, and, sewing, it, is, important, for, a, pattern, to, be, created, well, because, the, way, a, completed, piece, fits, is, the, reason, it, will, either, be, worn, or, not, most, clothing, today, is, mass, produced, and, conforms, to, standard, sizing, based, on, body, measurements, that, are, intended, to, fit, the, greatest, proportion, of, the, population, however, while, standard, sizing, is, generally, a, useful, guideline, it, is, little, more, than, that, because, there, is, no, industry, standard, that, is, both, widely, accepted, and, strictly, adhered, to, in, all, markets, home, sewers, often, work, from, sewing, patterns, purchased, from, companies, such, as, simplicity, butterick, mccall, s, vogue, and, many, others, such, patterns, are, typically, printed, on, large, pieces, of, tissue, paper, a, sewer, may, simply, cut, out, the, required, pattern, pieces, for, use, but, may, choose, to, transfer, the, pattern, onto, a, thicker, paper, if, repeated, use, is, desired, a, sewer, may, choose, to, alter, a, pattern, to, make, it, more, accurately, fit, the, intended, wearer, patterns, may, be, changed, to, increase, or, decrease, length, to, add, or, remove, fullness, to, adjust, the, position, of, the, waistline, shoulder, line, or, any, other, seam, or, a, variety, of, other, adjustments, volume, can, be, added, with, elements, such, as, pleats, or, reduced, with, the, use, of, darts, before, work, is, started, on, the, final, garment, test, garments, may, be, made, sometimes, referred, to, as, muslins, sewers, working, on, a, simple, project, need, only, a, few, sewing, tools, such, as, measuring, tape, needle, thread, cloth, and, sewing, shears, more, complex, projects, may, only, need, a, few, more, simple, tools, to, get, the, job, done, but, there, are, an, ever, growing, variety, of, helpful, sewing, aids, available, in, addition, to, sewing, shears, rotary, cutters, may, be, used, for, cutting, fabric, usually, used, with, a, cutting, mat, to, protect, other, surfaces, from, being, damaged, seam, rippers, are, used, to, remove, mistaken, stitches, special, marking, pens, and, chalk, are, used, to, mark, the, fabric, as, a, guide, to, construction, pressing, and, ironing, are, an, essential, part, of, many, sewing, projects, and, require, additional, tools, a, steam, iron, is, used, to, press, seams, and, garments, and, a, variety, of, pressing, aids, such, as, a, seam, roll, or, tailor, s, ham, are, used, to, aid, in, shaping, a, garment, a, pressing, cloth, may, be, used, to, protect, the, fabric, from, damage, sewing, machines, are, now, made, for, a, broad, range, of, specialised, sewing, purposes, such, as, quilting, machines, heavy, duty, machines, for, sewing, thicker, fabrics, such, as, leather, computerized, machines, for, embroidery, and, sergers, for, finishing, raw, edges, of, fabric, a, wide, variety, of, presser, foot, attachments, are, available, for, many, sewing, machines, feet, exist, to, help, with, hemming, pintucks, attaching, cording, assembling, patchwork, quilting, and, a, variety, of, other, functions, a, thimble, is, a, small, hard, tool, used, as, a, protective, device, for, sewing, a, seam, ripper, may, also, be, used, if, working, with, existing, garments, seamstresses, are, provided, with, the, pattern, while, tailors, would, draft, their, own, pattern, both, with, the, intent, of, using, as, little, fabric, as, possible, patterns, will, specify, whether, to, cut, on, the, grain, or, the, bias, to, manipulate, fabric, stretch, special, placement, may, be, required, for, directional, striped, or, plaid, fabrics, supporting, materials, such, as, interfacing, interlining, or, lining, may, be, used, in, garment, construction, to, give, the, fabric, a, more, rigid, or, durable, shape, before, or, after, the, pattern, pieces, are, cut, it, is, often, necessary, to, mark, the, pieces, to, provide, a, guide, during, the, sewing, process, marking, methods, may, include, using, pens, pencils, or, chalk, tailor, s, tacks, snips, pins, or, thread, tracing, among, others, in, addition, to, the, normal, lockstitch, construction, stitches, include, edgestitching, understitching, staystitching, and, topstitching, seam, types, include, the, plain, seam, zigzag, seam, flat, fell, seam, french, seam, and, many, others, with, the, development, of, cloth, simulation, software, such, as, clo3d, marvelous, designer, and, optitex, seamsters, can, now, draft, patterns, on, the, computer, and, visualize, clothing, designs, by, using, the, pattern, creation, tools, and, virtual, sewing, machines, within, these, cloth, simulation, programs, tailorbirds, genus, orthotomus, such, as, the, common, tailorbird, exhibit, sewing, behaviour, as, do, some, birds, of, related, genera, they, are, capable, of, stitching, together, the, edges, of, leaves, using, plant, fibres, or, spider, silk, as, thread, in, order, to, create, cavities, in, which, to, build, their, nests
