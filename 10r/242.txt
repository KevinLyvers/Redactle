glass, is, an, amorphous, non, crystalline, solid, because, it, is, often, transparent, and, chemically, inert, glass, has, found, widespread, practical, technological, and, decorative, use, in, window, panes, tableware, and, optics, some, common, objects, made, of, glass, like, a, glass, of, water, glasses, and, magnifying, glass, are, named, after, the, material, glass, is, most, often, formed, by, rapid, cooling, quenching, of, the, molten, form, some, glasses, such, as, volcanic, glass, are, naturally, occurring, and, obsidian, has, been, used, to, make, arrowheads, and, knives, since, the, stone, age, archaeological, evidence, suggests, glassmaking, dates, back, to, at, least, 3600, bc, in, mesopotamia, egypt, or, syria, the, earliest, known, glass, objects, were, beads, perhaps, created, accidentally, during, metalworking, or, the, production, of, faience, which, is, a, form, of, pottery, using, lead, glazes, due, to, its, ease, of, formability, into, any, shape, glass, has, been, traditionally, used, for, vessels, such, as, bowls, vases, bottles, jars, and, drinking, glasses, soda, lime, glass, containing, around, 70, silica, accounts, for, around, 90, of, modern, manufactured, glass, glass, can, be, coloured, by, adding, metal, salts, or, painted, and, printed, with, vitreous, enamels, leading, to, its, use, in, stained, glass, windows, and, other, glass, art, objects, the, refractive, reflective, and, transmission, properties, of, glass, make, glass, suitable, for, manufacturing, optical, lenses, prisms, and, optoelectronics, materials, extruded, glass, fibres, have, applications, as, optical, fibres, in, communications, networks, thermal, insulating, material, when, matted, as, glass, wool, to, trap, air, or, in, glass, fibre, reinforced, plastic, fibreglass, the, standard, definition, of, a, glass, or, vitreous, solid, is, a, non, crystalline, solid, formed, by, rapid, melt, quenching, however, the, term, glass, is, often, defined, in, a, broader, sense, to, describe, any, non, crystalline, amorphous, solid, that, exhibits, a, glass, transition, when, heated, towards, the, liquid, state, glass, is, an, amorphous, solid, although, the, atomic, scale, structure, of, glass, shares, characteristics, of, the, structure, of, a, supercooled, liquid, glass, exhibits, all, the, mechanical, properties, of, a, solid, as, in, other, amorphous, solids, the, atomic, structure, of, a, glass, lacks, the, long, range, periodicity, observed, in, crystalline, solids, due, to, chemical, bonding, constraints, glasses, do, possess, a, high, degree, of, short, range, order, with, respect, to, local, atomic, polyhedra, the, notion, that, glass, flows, to, an, appreciable, extent, over, extended, periods, well, below, the, glass, transition, temperature, is, not, supported, by, empirical, research, or, theoretical, analysis, see, viscosity, in, solids, though, atomic, motion, at, glass, surfaces, can, be, observed, and, viscosity, on, the, order, of, 10, 17, 10, 18, pa, s, can, be, measured, in, glass, such, a, high, value, reinforces, the, fact, that, glass, would, not, change, shape, appreciably, over, even, large, periods, of, time, for, melt, quenching, if, the, cooling, is, sufficiently, rapid, relative, to, the, characteristic, crystallization, time, then, crystallization, is, prevented, and, instead, the, disordered, atomic, configuration, of, the, supercooled, liquid, is, frozen, into, the, solid, state, at, t, g, the, tendency, for, a, material, to, form, a, glass, while, quenched, is, called, glass, forming, ability, this, ability, can, be, predicted, by, the, rigidity, theory, generally, a, glass, exists, in, a, structurally, metastable, state, with, respect, to, its, crystalline, form, although, in, certain, circumstances, for, example, in, atactic, polymers, there, is, no, crystalline, analogue, of, the, amorphous, phase, glass, is, sometimes, considered, to, be, a, liquid, due, to, its, lack, of, a, first, order, phase, transition, where, certain, thermodynamic, variables, such, as, volume, entropy, and, enthalpy, are, discontinuous, through, the, glass, transition, range, the, glass, transition, may, be, described, as, analogous, to, a, second, order, phase, transition, where, the, intensive, thermodynamic, variables, such, as, the, thermal, expansivity, and, heat, capacity, are, discontinuous, however, the, equilibrium, theory, of, phase, transformations, does, not, hold, for, glass, and, hence, the, glass, transition, cannot, be, classed, as, one, of, the, classical, equilibrium, phase, transformations, in, solids, glass, can, form, naturally, from, volcanic, magma, obsidian, is, a, common, volcanic, glass, with, high, silica, sio, 2, content, formed, when, felsic, lava, extruded, from, a, volcano, cools, rapidly, impactite, is, a, form, of, glass, formed, by, the, impact, of, a, meteorite, where, moldavite, found, in, central, and, eastern, europe, and, libyan, desert, glass, found, in, areas, in, the, eastern, sahara, the, deserts, of, eastern, libya, and, western, egypt, are, notable, examples, vitrification, of, quartz, can, also, occur, when, lightning, strikes, sand, forming, hollow, branching, rootlike, structures, called, fulgurites, trinitite, is, a, glassy, residue, formed, from, the, desert, floor, sand, at, the, trinity, nuclear, bomb, test, site, edeowie, glass, found, in, south, australia, is, proposed, to, originate, from, pleistocene, grassland, fires, lightning, strikes, or, hypervelocity, impact, by, one, or, several, asteroids, or, comets, naturally, occurring, obsidian, glass, was, used, by, stone, age, societies, as, it, fractures, along, very, sharp, edges, making, it, ideal, for, cutting, tools, and, weapons, glassmaking, dates, back, at, least, 6000, years, long, before, humans, had, discovered, how, to, smelt, iron, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, the, first, true, synthetic, glass, was, made, in, lebanon, and, the, coastal, north, syria, mesopotamia, or, ancient, egypt, the, earliest, known, glass, objects, of, the, mid, third, millennium, bc, were, beads, perhaps, initially, created, as, accidental, by, products, of, metalworking, slags, or, during, the, production, of, faience, a, pre, glass, vitreous, material, made, by, a, process, similar, to, glazing, early, glass, was, rarely, transparent, and, often, contained, impurities, and, imperfections, and, is, technically, faience, rather, than, true, glass, which, did, not, appear, until, the, 15th, century, bc, however, red, orange, glass, beads, excavated, from, the, indus, valley, civilization, dated, before, 1700, bc, possibly, as, early, as, 1900, bc, predate, sustained, glass, production, which, appeared, around, 1600, bc, in, mesopotamia, and, 1500, bc, in, egypt, during, the, late, bronze, age, there, was, a, rapid, growth, in, glassmaking, technology, in, egypt, and, western, asia, archaeological, finds, from, this, period, include, coloured, glass, ingots, vessels, and, beads, much, early, glass, production, relied, on, grinding, techniques, borrowed, from, stoneworking, such, as, grinding, and, carving, glass, in, a, cold, state, the, term, glass, developed, in, the, late, roman, empire, it, was, in, the, roman, glassmaking, centre, at, trier, located, in, current, day, germany, that, the, late, latin, term, glesum, originated, probably, from, a, germanic, word, for, a, transparent, lustrous, substance, glass, objects, have, been, recovered, across, the, roman, empire, in, domestic, funerary, and, industrial, contexts, as, well, as, trade, items, in, marketplaces, in, distant, provinces, examples, of, roman, glass, have, been, found, outside, of, the, former, roman, empire, in, china, the, baltics, the, middle, east, and, india, the, romans, perfected, cameo, glass, produced, by, etching, and, carving, through, fused, layers, of, different, colours, to, produce, a, design, in, relief, on, the, glass, object, in, post, classical, west, africa, benin, was, a, manufacturer, of, glass, and, glass, beads, glass, was, used, extensively, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, anglo, saxon, glass, has, been, found, across, england, during, archaeological, excavations, of, both, settlement, and, cemetery, sites, from, the, 10th, century, onwards, glass, was, employed, in, stained, glass, windows, of, churches, and, cathedrals, with, famous, examples, at, chartres, cathedral, and, the, basilica, of, saint, denis, by, the, 14th, century, architects, were, designing, buildings, with, walls, of, stained, glass, such, as, sainte, chapelle, paris, 1203, 1248, and, the, east, end, of, gloucester, cathedral, with, the, change, in, architectural, style, during, the, renaissance, period, in, europe, the, use, of, large, stained, glass, windows, became, much, less, prevalent, although, stained, glass, had, a, major, revival, with, gothic, revival, architecture, in, the, 19th, century, during, the, 13th, century, the, island, of, murano, venice, became, a, centre, for, glass, making, building, on, medieval, techniques, to, produce, colourful, ornamental, pieces, in, large, quantities, murano, glass, makers, developed, the, exceptionally, clear, colourless, glass, cristallo, so, called, for, its, resemblance, to, natural, crystal, which, was, extensively, used, for, windows, mirrors, ships, lanterns, and, lenses, in, the, 13th, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, enamelling, and, gilding, on, glass, vessels, were, perfected, in, egypt, and, syria, towards, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, bohemia, became, an, important, region, for, glass, production, remaining, so, until, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, by, the, 17th, century, glass, in, the, venetian, tradition, was, also, being, produced, in, england, in, about, 1675, george, ravenscroft, invented, lead, crystal, glass, with, cut, glass, becoming, fashionable, in, the, 18th, century, ornamental, glass, objects, became, an, important, art, medium, during, the, art, nouveau, period, in, the, late, 19th, century, throughout, the, 20th, century, new, mass, production, techniques, led, to, the, widespread, availability, of, glass, in, much, larger, amounts, making, it, practical, as, a, building, material, and, enabling, new, applications, of, glass, in, the, 1920s, a, mould, etch, process, was, developed, in, which, art, was, etched, directly, into, the, mould, so, that, each, cast, piece, emerged, from, the, mould, with, the, image, already, on, the, surface, of, the, glass, this, reduced, manufacturing, costs, and, combined, with, a, wider, use, of, coloured, glass, led, to, cheap, glassware, in, the, 1930s, which, later, became, known, as, depression, glass, in, the, 1950s, pilkington, bros, england, developed, the, float, glass, process, producing, high, quality, distortion, free, flat, sheets, of, glass, by, floating, on, molten, tin, modern, multi, story, buildings, are, frequently, constructed, with, curtain, walls, made, almost, entirely, of, glass, laminated, glass, has, been, widely, applied, to, vehicles, for, windscreens, optical, glass, for, spectacles, has, been, used, since, the, middle, ages, the, production, of, lenses, has, become, increasingly, proficient, aiding, astronomers, as, well, as, having, other, applications, in, medicine, and, science, glass, is, also, employed, as, the, aperture, cover, in, many, solar, energy, collectors, in, the, 21st, century, glass, manufacturers, have, developed, different, brands, of, chemically, strengthened, glass, for, widespread, application, in, touchscreens, for, smartphones, tablet, computers, and, many, other, types, of, information, appliances, these, include, gorilla, glass, developed, and, manufactured, by, corning, agc, inc, s, dragontrail, and, schott, ag, s, xensation, glass, is, in, widespread, use, in, optical, systems, due, to, its, ability, to, refract, reflect, and, transmit, light, following, geometrical, optics, the, most, common, and, oldest, applications, of, glass, in, optics, are, as, lenses, windows, mirrors, and, prisms, the, key, optical, properties, refractive, index, dispersion, and, transmission, of, glass, are, strongly, dependent, on, chemical, composition, and, to, a, lesser, degree, its, thermal, history, optical, glass, typically, has, a, refractive, index, of, 1, 4, to, 2, 4, and, an, abbe, number, which, characterises, dispersion, of, 15, to, 100, the, refractive, index, may, be, modified, by, high, density, refractive, index, increases, or, low, density, refractive, index, decreases, additives, glass, transparency, results, from, the, absence, of, grain, boundaries, which, diffusely, scatter, light, in, polycrystalline, materials, semi, opacity, due, to, crystallization, may, be, induced, in, many, glasses, by, maintaining, them, for, a, long, period, at, a, temperature, just, insufficient, to, cause, fusion, in, this, way, the, crystalline, devitrified, material, known, as, r, aumur, s, glass, porcelain, is, produced, although, generally, transparent, to, visible, light, glasses, may, be, opaque, to, other, wavelengths, of, light, while, silicate, glasses, are, generally, opaque, to, infrared, wavelengths, with, a, transmission, cut, off, at, 4, m, heavy, metal, fluoride, and, chalcogenide, glasses, are, transparent, to, infrared, wavelengths, of, 7, to, 18, m, the, addition, of, metallic, oxides, results, in, different, coloured, glasses, as, the, metallic, ions, will, absorb, wavelengths, of, light, corresponding, to, specific, colours, in, the, manufacturing, process, glasses, can, be, poured, formed, extruded, and, moulded, into, forms, ranging, from, flat, sheets, to, highly, intricate, shapes, the, finished, product, is, brittle, but, can, be, laminated, or, tempered, to, enhance, durability, glass, is, typically, inert, resistant, to, chemical, attack, and, can, mostly, withstand, the, action, of, water, making, it, an, ideal, material, for, the, manufacture, of, containers, for, foodstuffs, and, most, chemicals, nevertheless, although, usually, highly, resistant, to, chemical, attack, glass, will, corrode, or, dissolve, under, some, conditions, the, materials, that, make, up, a, particular, glass, composition, affect, how, quickly, the, glass, corrodes, glasses, containing, a, high, proportion, of, alkali, or, alkaline, earth, elements, are, more, susceptible, to, corrosion, than, other, glass, compositions, the, density, of, glass, varies, with, chemical, composition, with, values, ranging, from, 2, 2, grams, per, cubic, centimetre, 2, 200, kg, m, 3, for, fused, silica, to, 7, 2, grams, per, cubic, centimetre, 7, 200, kg, m, 3, for, dense, flint, glass, glass, is, stronger, than, most, metals, with, a, theoretical, tensile, strength, for, pure, flawless, glass, estimated, at, 14, to, 35, gigapascals, 2, 000, 000, to, 5, 100, 000, psi, due, to, its, ability, to, undergo, reversible, compression, without, fracture, however, the, presence, of, scratches, bubbles, and, other, microscopic, flaws, lead, to, a, typical, range, of, 14, to, 175, megapascals, 2, 000, to, 25, 400, psi, in, most, commercial, glasses, several, processes, such, as, toughening, can, increase, the, strength, of, glass, carefully, drawn, flawless, glass, fibres, can, be, produced, with, a, strength, of, up, to, 11, 5, gigapascals, 1, 670, 000, psi, the, observation, that, old, windows, are, sometimes, found, to, be, thicker, at, the, bottom, than, at, the, top, is, often, offered, as, supporting, evidence, for, the, view, that, glass, flows, over, a, timescale, of, centuries, the, assumption, being, that, the, glass, has, exhibited, the, liquid, property, of, flowing, from, one, shape, to, another, this, assumption, is, incorrect, as, once, solidified, glass, stops, flowing, the, sags, and, ripples, observed, in, old, glass, were, already, there, the, day, it, was, made, manufacturing, processes, used, in, the, past, produced, sheets, with, imperfect, surfaces, and, non, uniform, thickness, the, near, perfect, float, glass, used, today, only, became, widespread, in, the, 1960s, a, 2017, study, computed, the, rate, of, flow, of, the, medieval, glass, used, in, westminster, abbey, from, the, year, 1268, the, study, found, that, the, room, temperature, viscosity, of, this, glass, was, roughly, 10, 24, pa, s, which, is, about, 10, 16, times, less, viscous, than, a, previous, estimate, made, in, 1998, which, focused, on, soda, lime, silicate, glass, even, with, this, lower, viscosity, the, study, authors, calculated, that, the, maximum, flow, rate, of, medieval, glass, is, 1, nm, per, billion, years, making, it, impossible, to, observe, in, a, human, timescale, silicon, dioxide, sio, 2, is, a, common, fundamental, constituent, of, glass, fused, quartz, is, a, glass, made, from, chemically, pure, silica, it, has, very, low, thermal, expansion, and, excellent, resistance, to, thermal, shock, being, able, to, survive, immersion, in, water, while, red, hot, resists, high, temperatures, 1000, 1500, c, and, chemical, weathering, and, is, very, hard, it, is, also, transparent, to, a, wider, spectral, range, than, ordinary, glass, extending, from, the, visible, further, into, both, the, uv, and, ir, ranges, and, is, sometimes, used, where, transparency, to, these, wavelengths, is, necessary, fused, quartz, is, used, for, high, temperature, applications, such, as, furnace, tubes, lighting, tubes, melting, crucibles, etc, however, its, high, melting, temperature, 1723, c, and, viscosity, make, it, difficult, to, work, with, therefore, normally, other, substances, fluxes, are, added, to, lower, the, melting, temperature, and, simplify, glass, processing, sodium, carbonate, na, 2, co, 3, soda, is, a, common, additive, and, acts, to, lower, the, glass, transition, temperature, however, sodium, silicate, is, water, soluble, so, lime, cao, calcium, oxide, generally, obtained, from, limestone, along, with, magnesium, oxide, mgo, and, aluminium, oxide, al, 2, o, 3, are, commonly, added, to, improve, chemical, durability, soda, lime, glasses, na, 2, o, lime, cao, magnesia, mgo, alumina, al, 2, o, 3, account, for, over, 75, of, manufactured, glass, containing, about, 70, to, 74, silica, by, weight, soda, lime, silicate, glass, is, transparent, easily, formed, and, most, suitable, for, window, glass, and, tableware, however, it, has, a, high, thermal, expansion, and, poor, resistance, to, heat, soda, lime, glass, is, typically, used, for, windows, bottles, light, bulbs, and, jars, borosilicate, glasses, e, g, pyrex, duran, typically, contain, 5, 13, boron, trioxide, b, 2, o, 3, borosilicate, glasses, have, fairly, low, coefficients, of, thermal, expansion, 7740, pyrex, cte, is, 3, 25, 10, 6, c, as, compared, to, about, 9, 10, 6, c, for, a, typical, soda, lime, glass, they, are, therefore, less, subject, to, stress, caused, by, thermal, expansion, and, thus, less, vulnerable, to, cracking, from, thermal, shock, they, are, commonly, used, for, e, g, labware, household, cookware, and, sealed, beam, car, head, lamps, the, addition, of, lead, ii, oxide, into, silicate, glass, lowers, the, melting, point, and, viscosity, of, the, melt, the, high, density, of, lead, glass, silica, lead, oxide, pbo, potassium, oxide, k, 2, o, soda, na, 2, o, zinc, oxide, zno, alumina, results, in, a, high, electron, density, and, hence, high, refractive, index, making, the, look, of, glassware, more, brilliant, and, causing, noticeably, more, specular, reflection, and, increased, optical, dispersion, lead, glass, has, a, high, elasticity, making, the, glassware, more, workable, and, giving, rise, to, a, clear, ring, sound, when, struck, however, lead, glass, cannot, withstand, high, temperatures, well, lead, oxide, also, facilitates, the, solubility, of, other, metal, oxides, and, is, used, in, coloured, glass, the, viscosity, decrease, of, lead, glass, melt, is, very, significant, roughly, 100, times, in, comparison, with, soda, glass, this, allows, easier, removal, of, bubbles, and, working, at, lower, temperatures, hence, its, frequent, use, as, an, additive, in, vitreous, enamels, and, glass, solders, the, high, ionic, radius, of, the, pb, 2, ion, renders, it, highly, immobile, and, hinders, the, movement, of, other, ions, lead, glasses, therefore, have, high, electrical, resistance, about, two, orders, of, magnitude, higher, than, soda, lime, glass, 10, 8, 5, vs, 10, 6, 5, cm, dc, at, 250, c, aluminosilicate, glass, typically, contains, 5, 10, alumina, al, 2, o, 3, aluminosilicate, glass, tends, to, be, more, difficult, to, melt, and, shape, compared, to, borosilicate, compositions, but, has, excellent, thermal, resistance, and, durability, aluminosilicate, glass, is, extensively, used, for, fibreglass, used, for, making, glass, reinforced, plastics, boats, fishing, rods, etc, top, of, stove, cookware, and, halogen, bulb, glass, the, addition, of, barium, also, increases, the, refractive, index, thorium, oxide, gives, glass, a, high, refractive, index, and, low, dispersion, and, was, formerly, used, in, producing, high, quality, lenses, but, due, to, its, radioactivity, has, been, replaced, by, lanthanum, oxide, in, modern, eyeglasses, iron, can, be, incorporated, into, glass, to, absorb, infrared, radiation, for, example, in, heat, absorbing, filters, for, movie, projectors, while, cerium, iv, oxide, can, be, used, for, glass, that, absorbs, ultraviolet, wavelengths, fluorine, lowers, the, dielectric, constant, of, glass, fluorine, is, highly, electronegative, and, lowers, the, polarizability, of, the, material, fluoride, silicate, glasses, are, used, in, the, manufacture, of, integrated, circuits, as, an, insulator, glass, ceramic, materials, contain, both, non, crystalline, glass, and, crystalline, ceramic, phases, they, are, formed, by, controlled, nucleation, and, partial, crystallisation, of, a, base, glass, by, heat, treatment, crystalline, grains, are, often, embedded, within, a, non, crystalline, intergranular, phase, of, grain, boundaries, glass, ceramics, exhibit, advantageous, thermal, chemical, biological, and, dielectric, properties, as, compared, to, metals, or, organic, polymers, the, most, commercially, important, property, of, glass, ceramics, is, their, imperviousness, to, thermal, shock, thus, glass, ceramics, have, become, extremely, useful, for, countertop, cooking, and, industrial, processes, the, negative, thermal, expansion, coefficient, cte, of, the, crystalline, ceramic, phase, can, be, balanced, with, the, positive, cte, of, the, glassy, phase, at, a, certain, point, 70, crystalline, the, glass, ceramic, has, a, net, cte, near, zero, this, type, of, glass, ceramic, exhibits, excellent, mechanical, properties, and, can, sustain, repeated, and, quick, temperature, changes, up, to, 1000, c, fibreglass, also, called, glass, fibre, reinforced, plastic, grp, is, a, composite, material, made, by, reinforcing, a, plastic, resin, with, glass, fibres, it, is, made, by, melting, glass, and, stretching, the, glass, into, fibres, these, fibres, are, woven, together, into, a, cloth, and, left, to, set, in, a, plastic, resin, fibreglass, has, the, properties, of, being, lightweight, and, corrosion, resistant, and, is, a, good, insulator, enabling, its, use, as, building, insulation, material, and, for, electronic, housing, for, consumer, products, fibreglass, was, originally, used, in, the, united, kingdom, and, united, states, during, world, war, ii, to, manufacture, radomes, uses, of, fibreglass, include, building, and, construction, materials, boat, hulls, car, body, parts, and, aerospace, composite, materials, glass, fibre, wool, is, an, excellent, thermal, and, sound, insulation, material, commonly, used, in, buildings, e, g, attic, and, cavity, wall, insulation, and, plumbing, e, g, pipe, insulation, and, soundproofing, it, is, produced, by, forcing, molten, glass, through, a, fine, mesh, by, centripetal, force, and, breaking, the, extruded, glass, fibres, into, short, lengths, using, a, stream, of, high, velocity, air, the, fibres, are, bonded, with, an, adhesive, spray, and, the, resulting, wool, mat, is, cut, and, packed, in, rolls, or, panels, besides, common, silica, based, glasses, many, other, inorganic, and, organic, materials, may, also, form, glasses, including, metals, aluminates, phosphates, borates, chalcogenides, fluorides, germanates, glasses, based, on, geo, 2, tellurites, glasses, based, on, teo, 2, antimonates, glasses, based, on, sb, 2, o, 3, arsenates, glasses, based, on, as, 2, o, 3, titanates, glasses, based, on, tio, 2, tantalates, glasses, based, on, ta, 2, o, 5, nitrates, carbonates, plastics, acrylic, and, many, other, substances, some, of, these, glasses, e, g, germanium, dioxide, geo, 2, germania, in, many, respects, a, structural, analogue, of, silica, fluoride, aluminate, phosphate, borate, and, chalcogenide, glasses, have, physicochemical, properties, useful, for, their, application, in, fibre, optic, waveguides, in, communication, networks, and, other, specialised, technological, applications, silica, free, glasses, may, often, have, poor, glass, forming, tendencies, novel, techniques, including, containerless, processing, by, aerodynamic, levitation, cooling, the, melt, whilst, it, floats, on, a, gas, stream, or, splat, quenching, pressing, the, melt, between, two, metal, anvils, or, rollers, may, be, used, to, increase, the, cooling, rate, or, to, reduce, crystal, nucleation, triggers, in, the, past, small, batches, of, amorphous, metals, with, high, surface, area, configurations, ribbons, wires, films, etc, have, been, produced, through, the, implementation, of, extremely, rapid, rates, of, cooling, amorphous, metal, wires, have, been, produced, by, sputtering, molten, metal, onto, a, spinning, metal, disk, several, alloys, have, been, produced, in, layers, with, thicknesses, exceeding, 1, millimetre, these, are, known, as, bulk, metallic, glasses, bmg, liquidmetal, technologies, sells, several, zirconium, based, bmgs, batches, of, amorphous, steel, have, also, been, produced, that, demonstrate, mechanical, properties, far, exceeding, those, found, in, conventional, steel, alloys, experimental, evidence, indicates, that, the,
