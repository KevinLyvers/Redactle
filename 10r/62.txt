in, computing, a, database, is, an, organized, collection, of, data, or, a, type, of, data, store, based, on, the, use, of, a, database, management, system, dbms, the, software, that, interacts, with, end, users, applications, and, the, database, itself, to, capture, and, analyze, the, data, the, dbms, additionally, encompasses, the, core, facilities, provided, to, administer, the, database, the, sum, total, of, the, database, the, dbms, and, the, associated, applications, can, be, referred, to, as, a, database, system, often, the, term, database, is, also, used, loosely, to, refer, to, any, of, the, dbms, the, database, system, or, an, application, associated, with, the, database, small, databases, can, be, stored, on, a, file, system, while, large, databases, are, hosted, on, computer, clusters, or, cloud, storage, the, design, of, databases, spans, formal, techniques, and, practical, considerations, including, data, modeling, efficient, data, representation, and, storage, query, languages, security, and, privacy, of, sensitive, data, and, distributed, computing, issues, including, supporting, concurrent, access, and, fault, tolerance, computer, scientists, may, classify, database, management, systems, according, to, the, database, models, that, they, support, relational, databases, became, dominant, in, the, 1980s, these, model, data, as, rows, and, columns, in, a, series, of, tables, and, the, vast, majority, use, sql, for, writing, and, querying, data, in, the, 2000s, non, relational, databases, became, popular, collectively, referred, to, as, nosql, because, they, use, different, query, languages, formally, a, database, refers, to, a, set, of, related, data, accessed, through, the, use, of, a, database, management, system, dbms, which, is, an, integrated, set, of, computer, software, that, allows, users, to, interact, with, one, or, more, databases, and, provides, access, to, all, of, the, data, contained, in, the, database, although, restrictions, may, exist, that, limit, access, to, particular, data, the, dbms, provides, various, functions, that, allow, entry, storage, and, retrieval, of, large, quantities, of, information, and, provides, ways, to, manage, how, that, information, is, organized, because, of, the, close, relationship, between, them, the, term, database, is, often, used, casually, to, refer, to, both, a, database, and, the, dbms, used, to, manipulate, it, outside, the, world, of, professional, information, technology, the, term, database, is, often, used, to, refer, to, any, collection, of, related, data, such, as, a, spreadsheet, or, a, card, index, as, size, and, usage, requirements, typically, necessitate, use, of, a, database, management, system, existing, dbmss, provide, various, functions, that, allow, management, of, a, database, and, its, data, which, can, be, classified, into, four, main, functional, groups, both, a, database, and, its, dbms, conform, to, the, principles, of, a, particular, database, model, database, system, refers, collectively, to, the, database, model, database, management, system, and, database, physically, database, servers, are, dedicated, computers, that, hold, the, actual, databases, and, run, only, the, dbms, and, related, software, database, servers, are, usually, multiprocessor, computers, with, generous, memory, and, raid, disk, arrays, used, for, stable, storage, hardware, database, accelerators, connected, to, one, or, more, servers, via, a, high, speed, channel, are, also, used, in, large, volume, transaction, processing, environments, dbmss, are, found, at, the, heart, of, most, database, applications, dbmss, may, be, built, around, a, custom, multitasking, kernel, with, built, in, networking, support, but, modern, dbmss, typically, rely, on, a, standard, operating, system, to, provide, these, functions, since, dbmss, comprise, a, significant, market, computer, and, storage, vendors, often, take, into, account, dbms, requirements, in, their, own, development, plans, databases, and, dbmss, can, be, categorized, according, to, the, database, model, s, that, they, support, such, as, relational, or, xml, the, type, s, of, computer, they, run, on, from, a, server, cluster, to, a, mobile, phone, the, query, language, s, used, to, access, the, database, such, as, sql, or, xquery, and, their, internal, engineering, which, affects, performance, scalability, resilience, and, security, the, sizes, capabilities, and, performance, of, databases, and, their, respective, dbmss, have, grown, in, orders, of, magnitude, these, performance, increases, were, enabled, by, the, technology, progress, in, the, areas, of, processors, computer, memory, computer, storage, and, computer, networks, the, concept, of, a, database, was, made, possible, by, the, emergence, of, direct, access, storage, media, such, as, magnetic, disks, which, became, widely, available, in, the, mid, 1960s, earlier, systems, relied, on, sequential, storage, of, data, on, magnetic, tape, the, subsequent, development, of, database, technology, can, be, divided, into, three, eras, based, on, data, model, or, structure, navigational, sql, relational, and, post, relational, the, two, main, early, navigational, data, models, were, the, hierarchical, model, and, the, codasyl, model, network, model, these, were, characterized, by, the, use, of, pointers, often, physical, disk, addresses, to, follow, relationships, from, one, record, to, another, the, relational, model, first, proposed, in, 1970, by, edgar, f, codd, departed, from, this, tradition, by, insisting, that, applications, should, search, for, data, by, content, rather, than, by, following, links, the, relational, model, employs, sets, of, ledger, style, tables, each, used, for, a, different, type, of, entity, only, in, the, mid, 1980s, did, computing, hardware, become, powerful, enough, to, allow, the, wide, deployment, of, relational, systems, dbmss, plus, applications, by, the, early, 1990s, however, relational, systems, dominated, in, all, large, scale, data, processing, applications, and, as, of, 2018, they, remain, dominant, ibm, db2, oracle, mysql, and, microsoft, sql, server, are, the, most, searched, dbms, the, dominant, database, language, standardized, sql, for, the, relational, model, has, influenced, database, languages, for, other, data, models, object, databases, were, developed, in, the, 1980s, to, overcome, the, inconvenience, of, object, relational, impedance, mismatch, which, led, to, the, coining, of, the, term, post, relational, and, also, the, development, of, hybrid, object, relational, databases, the, next, generation, of, post, relational, databases, in, the, late, 2000s, became, known, as, nosql, databases, introducing, fast, key, value, stores, and, document, oriented, databases, a, competing, next, generation, known, as, newsql, databases, attempted, new, implementations, that, retained, the, relational, sql, model, while, aiming, to, match, the, high, performance, of, nosql, compared, to, commercially, available, relational, dbmss, the, introduction, of, the, term, database, coincided, with, the, availability, of, direct, access, storage, disks, and, drums, from, the, mid, 1960s, onwards, the, term, represented, a, contrast, with, the, tape, based, systems, of, the, past, allowing, shared, interactive, use, rather, than, daily, batch, processing, the, oxford, english, dictionary, cites, a, 1962, report, by, the, system, development, corporation, of, california, as, the, first, to, use, the, term, data, base, in, a, specific, technical, sense, as, computers, grew, in, speed, and, capability, a, number, of, general, purpose, database, systems, emerged, by, the, mid, 1960s, a, number, of, such, systems, had, come, into, commercial, use, interest, in, a, standard, began, to, grow, and, charles, bachman, author, of, one, such, product, the, integrated, data, store, ids, founded, the, database, task, group, within, codasyl, the, group, responsible, for, the, creation, and, standardization, of, cobol, in, 1971, the, database, task, group, delivered, their, standard, which, generally, became, known, as, the, codasyl, approach, and, soon, a, number, of, commercial, products, based, on, this, approach, entered, the, market, the, codasyl, approach, offered, applications, the, ability, to, navigate, around, a, linked, data, set, which, was, formed, into, a, large, network, applications, could, find, records, by, one, of, three, methods, later, systems, added, b, trees, to, provide, alternate, access, paths, many, codasyl, databases, also, added, a, declarative, query, language, for, end, users, as, distinct, from, the, navigational, api, however, codasyl, databases, were, complex, and, required, significant, training, and, effort, to, produce, useful, applications, ibm, also, had, its, own, dbms, in, 1966, known, as, information, management, system, ims, ims, was, a, development, of, software, written, for, the, apollo, program, on, the, system, 360, ims, was, generally, similar, in, concept, to, codasyl, but, used, a, strict, hierarchy, for, its, model, of, data, navigation, instead, of, codasyl, s, network, model, both, concepts, later, became, known, as, navigational, databases, due, to, the, way, data, was, accessed, the, term, was, popularized, by, bachman, s, 1973, turing, award, presentation, the, programmer, as, navigator, ims, is, classified, by, ibm, as, a, hierarchical, database, idms, and, cincom, systems, total, databases, are, classified, as, network, databases, ims, remains, in, use, as, of, 2014, edgar, f, codd, worked, at, ibm, in, san, jose, california, in, one, of, their, offshoot, offices, that, were, primarily, involved, in, the, development, of, hard, disk, systems, he, was, unhappy, with, the, navigational, model, of, the, codasyl, approach, notably, the, lack, of, a, search, facility, in, 1970, he, wrote, a, number, of, papers, that, outlined, a, new, approach, to, database, construction, that, eventually, culminated, in, the, groundbreaking, a, relational, model, of, data, for, large, shared, data, banks, in, this, paper, he, described, a, new, system, for, storing, and, working, with, large, databases, instead, of, records, being, stored, in, some, sort, of, linked, list, of, free, form, records, as, in, codasyl, codd, s, idea, was, to, organize, the, data, as, a, number, of, tables, each, table, being, used, for, a, different, type, of, entity, each, table, would, contain, a, fixed, number, of, columns, containing, the, attributes, of, the, entity, one, or, more, columns, of, each, table, were, designated, as, a, primary, key, by, which, the, rows, of, the, table, could, be, uniquely, identified, cross, references, between, tables, always, used, these, primary, keys, rather, than, disk, addresses, and, queries, would, join, tables, based, on, these, key, relationships, using, a, set, of, operations, based, on, the, mathematical, system, of, relational, calculus, from, which, the, model, takes, its, name, splitting, the, data, into, a, set, of, normalized, tables, or, relations, aimed, to, ensure, that, each, fact, was, only, stored, once, thus, simplifying, update, operations, virtual, tables, called, views, could, present, the, data, in, different, ways, for, different, users, but, views, could, not, be, directly, updated, codd, used, mathematical, terms, to, define, the, model, relations, tuples, and, domains, rather, than, tables, rows, and, columns, the, terminology, that, is, now, familiar, came, from, early, implementations, codd, would, later, criticize, the, tendency, for, practical, implementations, to, depart, from, the, mathematical, foundations, on, which, the, model, was, based, the, use, of, primary, keys, user, oriented, identifiers, to, represent, cross, table, relationships, rather, than, disk, addresses, had, two, primary, motivations, from, an, engineering, perspective, it, enabled, tables, to, be, relocated, and, resized, without, expensive, database, reorganization, but, codd, was, more, interested, in, the, difference, in, semantics, the, use, of, explicit, identifiers, made, it, easier, to, define, update, operations, with, clean, mathematical, definitions, and, it, also, enabled, query, operations, to, be, defined, in, terms, of, the, established, discipline, of, first, order, predicate, calculus, because, these, operations, have, clean, mathematical, properties, it, becomes, possible, to, rewrite, queries, in, provably, correct, ways, which, is, the, basis, of, query, optimization, there, is, no, loss, of, expressiveness, compared, with, the, hierarchic, or, network, models, though, the, connections, between, tables, are, no, longer, so, explicit, in, the, hierarchic, and, network, models, records, were, allowed, to, have, a, complex, internal, structure, for, example, the, salary, history, of, an, employee, might, be, represented, as, a, repeating, group, within, the, employee, record, in, the, relational, model, the, process, of, normalization, led, to, such, internal, structures, being, replaced, by, data, held, in, multiple, tables, connected, only, by, logical, keys, for, instance, a, common, use, of, a, database, system, is, to, track, information, about, users, their, name, login, information, various, addresses, and, phone, numbers, in, the, navigational, approach, all, of, this, data, would, be, placed, in, a, single, variable, length, record, in, the, relational, approach, the, data, would, be, normalized, into, a, user, table, an, address, table, and, a, phone, number, table, for, instance, records, would, be, created, in, these, optional, tables, only, if, the, address, or, phone, numbers, were, actually, provided, as, well, as, identifying, rows, records, using, logical, identifiers, rather, than, disk, addresses, codd, changed, the, way, in, which, applications, assembled, data, from, multiple, records, rather, than, requiring, applications, to, gather, data, one, record, at, a, time, by, navigating, the, links, they, would, use, a, declarative, query, language, that, expressed, what, data, was, required, rather, than, the, access, path, by, which, it, should, be, found, finding, an, efficient, access, path, to, the, data, became, the, responsibility, of, the, database, management, system, rather, than, the, application, programmer, this, process, called, query, optimization, depended, on, the, fact, that, queries, were, expressed, in, terms, of, mathematical, logic, codd, s, paper, was, picked, up, by, two, people, at, berkeley, eugene, wong, and, michael, stonebraker, they, started, a, project, known, as, ingres, using, funding, that, had, already, been, allocated, for, a, geographical, database, project, and, student, programmers, to, produce, code, beginning, in, 1973, ingres, delivered, its, first, test, products, which, were, generally, ready, for, widespread, use, in, 1979, ingres, was, similar, to, system, r, in, a, number, of, ways, including, the, use, of, a, language, for, data, access, known, as, quel, over, time, ingres, moved, to, the, emerging, sql, standard, ibm, itself, did, one, test, implementation, of, the, relational, model, prtv, and, a, production, one, business, system, 12, both, now, discontinued, honeywell, wrote, mrds, for, multics, and, now, there, are, two, new, implementations, alphora, dataphor, and, rel, most, other, dbms, implementations, usually, called, relational, are, actually, sql, dbmss, in, 1970, the, university, of, michigan, began, development, of, the, micro, information, management, system, based, on, d, l, childs, set, theoretic, data, model, micro, was, used, to, manage, very, large, data, sets, by, the, us, department, of, labor, the, u, s, environmental, protection, agency, and, researchers, from, the, university, of, alberta, the, university, of, michigan, and, wayne, state, university, it, ran, on, ibm, mainframe, computers, using, the, michigan, terminal, system, the, system, remained, in, production, until, 1998, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, attempts, were, made, to, build, database, systems, with, integrated, hardware, and, software, the, underlying, philosophy, was, that, such, integration, would, provide, higher, performance, at, a, lower, cost, examples, were, ibm, system, 38, the, early, offering, of, teradata, and, the, britton, lee, inc, database, machine, another, approach, to, hardware, support, for, database, management, was, icl, s, cafs, accelerator, a, hardware, disk, controller, with, programmable, search, capabilities, in, the, long, term, these, efforts, were, generally, unsuccessful, because, specialized, database, machines, could, not, keep, pace, with, the, rapid, development, and, progress, of, general, purpose, computers, thus, most, database, systems, nowadays, are, software, systems, running, on, general, purpose, hardware, using, general, purpose, computer, data, storage, however, this, idea, is, still, pursued, in, certain, applications, by, some, companies, like, netezza, and, oracle, exadata, ibm, started, working, on, a, prototype, system, loosely, based, on, codd, s, concepts, as, system, r, in, the, early, 1970s, the, first, version, was, ready, in, 1974, 5, and, work, then, started, on, multi, table, systems, in, which, the, data, could, be, split, so, that, all, of, the, data, for, a, record, some, of, which, is, optional, did, not, have, to, be, stored, in, a, single, large, chunk, subsequent, multi, user, versions, were, tested, by, customers, in, 1978, and, 1979, by, which, time, a, standardized, query, language, sql, had, been, added, codd, s, ideas, were, establishing, themselves, as, both, workable, and, superior, to, codasyl, pushing, ibm, to, develop, a, true, production, version, of, system, r, known, as, sql, ds, and, later, database, 2, ibm, db2, larry, ellison, s, oracle, database, or, more, simply, oracle, started, from, a, different, chain, based, on, ibm, s, papers, on, system, r, though, oracle, v1, implementations, were, completed, in, 1978, it, was, not, until, oracle, version, 2, when, ellison, beat, ibm, to, market, in, 1979, stonebraker, went, on, to, apply, the, lessons, from, ingres, to, develop, a, new, database, postgres, which, is, now, known, as, postgresql, postgresql, is, often, used, for, global, mission, critical, applications, the, org, and, info, domain, name, registries, use, it, as, their, primary, data, store, as, do, many, large, companies, and, financial, institutions, in, sweden, codd, s, paper, was, also, read, and, mimer, sql, was, developed, in, the, mid, 1970s, at, uppsala, university, in, 1984, this, project, was, consolidated, into, an, independent, enterprise, another, data, model, the, entity, relationship, model, emerged, in, 1976, and, gained, popularity, for, database, design, as, it, emphasized, a, more, familiar, description, than, the, earlier, relational, model, later, on, entity, relationship, constructs, were, retrofitted, as, a, data, modeling, construct, for, the, relational, model, and, the, difference, between, the, two, has, become, irrelevant, the, 1980s, ushered, in, the, age, of, desktop, computing, the, new, computers, empowered, their, users, with, spreadsheets, like, lotus, 1, 2, 3, and, database, software, like, dbase, the, dbase, product, was, lightweight, and, easy, for, any, computer, user, to, understand, out, of, the, box, c, wayne, ratliff, the, creator, of, dbase, stated, dbase, was, different, from, programs, like, basic, c, fortran, and, cobol, in, that, a, lot, of, the, dirty, work, had, already, been, done, the, data, manipulation, is, done, by, dbase, instead, of, by, the, user, so, the, user, can, concentrate, on, what, he, is, doing, rather, than, having, to, mess, with, the, dirty, details, of, opening, reading, and, closing, files, and, managing, space, allocation, dbase, was, one, of, the, top, selling, software, titles, in, the, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, the, 1990s, along, with, a, rise, in, object, oriented, programming, saw, a, growth, in, how, data, in, various, databases, were, handled, programmers, and, designers, began, to, treat, the, data, in, their, databases, as, objects, that, is, to, say, that, if, a, person, s, data, were, in, a, database, that, person, s, attributes, such, as, their, address, phone, number, and, age, were, now, considered, to, belong, to, that, person, instead, of, being, extraneous, data, this, allows, for, relations, between, data, to, be, related, to, objects, and, their, attributes, and, not, to, individual, fields, the, term, object, relational, impedance, mismatch, described, the, inconvenience, of, translating, between, programmed, objects, and, database, tables, object, databases, and, object, relational, databases, attempt, to, solve, this, problem, by, providing, an, object, oriented, language, sometimes, as, extensions, to, sql, that, programmers, can, use, as, alternative, to, purely, relational, sql, on, the, programming, side, libraries, known, as, object, relational, mappings, orms, attempt, to, solve, the, same, problem, xml, databases, are, a, type, of, structured, document, oriented, database, that, allows, querying, based, on, xml, document, attributes, xml, databases, are, mostly, used, in, applications, where, the, data, is, conveniently, viewed, as, a, collection, of, documents, with, a, structure, that, can, vary, from, the, very, flexible, to, the, highly, rigid, examples, include, scientific, articles, patents, tax, filings, and, personnel, records, nosql, databases, are, often, very, fast, do, not, require, fixed, table, schemas, avoid, join, operations, by, storing, denormalized, data, and, are, designed, to, scale, horizontally, in, recent, years, there, has, been, a, strong, demand, for, massively, distributed, databases, with, high, partition, tolerance, but, according, to, the, cap, theorem, it, is, impossible, for, a, distributed, system, to, simultaneously, provide, consistency, availability, and, partition, tolerance, guarantees, a, distributed, system, can, satisfy, any, two, of, these, guarantees, at, the, same, time, but, not, all, three, for, that, reason, many, nosql, databases, are, using, what, is, called, eventual, consistency, to, provide, both, availability, and, partition, tolerance, guarantees, with, a, reduced, level, of, data, consistency, newsql, is, a, class, of, modern, relational, databases, that, aims, to, provide, the, same, scalable, performance, of, nosql, systems, for, online, transaction, processing, read, write, workloads, while, still, using, sql, and, maintaining, the, acid, guarantees, of, a, traditional, database, system, databases, are, used, to, support, internal, operations, of, organizations, and, to, underpin, online, interactions, with, customers, and, suppliers, see, enterprise, software, databases, are, used, to, hold, administrative, information, and, more, specialized, data, such, as, engineering, data, or, economic, models, examples, include, computerized, library, systems, flight, reservation, systems, computerized, parts, inventory, systems, and, many, content, management, systems, that, store, websites, as, collections, of, webpages, in, a, database, one, way, to, classify, databases, involves, the, type, of, their, contents, for, example, bibliographic, document, text, statistical, or, multimedia, objects, another, way, is, by, their, application, area, for, example, accounting, music, compositions, movies, banking, manufacturing, or, insurance, a, third, way, is, by, some, technical, aspect, such, as, the, database, structure, or, interface, type, this, section, lists, a, few, of, the, adjectives, used, to, characterize, different, kinds, of, databases, connolly, and, begg, define, database, management, system, dbms, as, a, software, system, that, enables, users, to, define, create, maintain, and, control, access, to, the, database, examples, of, dbms, s, include, mysql, mariadb, postgresql, microsoft, sql, server, oracle, database, and, microsoft, access, the, dbms, acronym, is, sometimes, extended, to, indicate, the, underlying, database, model, with, rdbms, for, the, relational, oodbms, for, the, object, oriented, and, ordbms, for, the, object, relational, model, other, extensions, can, indicate, some, other, characteristics, such, as, ddbms, for, a, distributed, database, management, systems, the, functionality, provided, by, a, dbms, can, vary, enormously, the, core, functionality, is, the, storage, retrieval, and, update, of, data, codd, proposed, the, following, functions, and, services, a, fully, fledged, general, purpose, dbms, should, provide, it, is, also, generally, to, be, expected, the, dbms, will, provide, a, set, of, utilities, for, such, purposes, as, may, be, necessary, to, administer, the, database, effectively, including, import, export, monitoring, defragmentation, and, analysis, utilities, the, core, part, of, the, dbms, interacting, between, the, database, and, the, application, interface, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, database, engine, often, dbmss, will, have, configuration, parameters, that, can, be, statically, and, dynamically, tuned, for, example, the, maximum, amount, of, main, memory, on, a, server, the, database, can, use, the, trend, is, to, minimize, the, amount, of, manual, configuration, and, for, cases, such, as, embedded, databases, the, need, to, target, zero, administration, is, paramount, the, large, major, enterprise, dbmss, have, tended, to, increase, in, size, and, functionality, and, have, involved, up, to, thousands, of, human, years, of, development, effort, throughout, their, lifetime, early, multi, user, dbms, typically, only, allowed, for, the, application, to, reside, on, the, same, computer, with, access, via, terminals, or, terminal, emulation, software, the, client, server, architecture, was, a, development, where, the, application, resided, on, a, client, desktop, and, the, database, on, a, server, allowing, the, processing, to, be, distributed, this, evolved, into, a, multitier, architecture, incorporating, application, servers, and, web, servers, with, the, end, user, interface, via, a, web, browser, with, the, database, only, directly, connected, to, the, adjacent, tier, a, general, purpose, dbms, will, provide, public, application, programming, interfaces, api, and, optionally, a, processor, for, database, languages, such, as, sql, to, allow, applications, to, be, written, to, interact, with, and, manipulate, the, database, a, special, purpose, dbms, may, use, a, private, api, and, be, specifically, customized, and, linked, to, a, single, application, for, example, an, email, system, performs, many, of, the, functions, of, a, general, purpose, dbms, such, as, message, insertion, message, deletion, attachment, handling, blocklist, lookup, associating, messages, an, email, address, and, so, forth, however, these, functions, are, limited, to, what, is, required, to, handle, email, external, interaction, with, the, database, will, be, via, an, application, program, that, interfaces, with, the, dbms, this, can, range, from, a, database, tool, that, allows, users, to, execute, sql, queries, textually, or, graphically, to, a, website, that, happens, to, use, a, database, to, store, and, search, information, a, programmer, will, code, interactions, to, the, database, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, datasource, via, an, application, program, interface, api, or, via, a, database, language, the, particular, api, or, language, chosen, will, need, to, be, supported, by, dbms, possibly, indirectly, via, a, preprocessor, or, a, bridging, api, some, api, s, aim, to, be, database, independent, odbc, being, a, commonly, known, example, other, common, api, s, include, jdbc, and, ado, net, database, languages, are, special, purpose, languages, which, allow, one, or, more, of, the, following, tasks, sometimes, distinguished, as, sublanguages, database, languages, are, specific, to, a, particular, data, model, notable, examples, include, a, database, language, may, also, incorporate, features, like, database, storage, is, the, container, of, the, physical, materialization, of, a, database, it, comprises, the, internal, physical, level, in, the, database, architecture, it, also, contains, all, the, information, needed, e, g, metadata, data, about, the, data, and, internal, data, structures, to, reconstruct, the, conceptual, level, and, external, level, from, the, internal, level, when, needed, databases, as, digital, objects, contain, three, layers, of, information, which, must, be, stored, the, data, the, structure, and, the, semantics, proper, storage, of, all, three, layers, is, needed, for, future, preservation, and, longevity, of, the, database, putting, data, into, permanent, storage, is, generally, the, responsibility, of, the, database, engine, a, k, a, storage, engine, though, typically, accessed, by, a, dbms, through, the, underlying, operating, system, and, often, using, the, operating, systems, file, systems, as, intermediates, for, storage, layout, storage, properties, and, configuration, settings, are, extremely, important, for, the, efficient, operation, of, the, dbms, and, thus, are, closely, maintained, by, database, administrators, a, dbms, while, in, operation, always, has, its, database, residing, in, several, types, of, storage, e, g, memory, and, external, storage, the, database, data, and, the, additional, needed, information, possibly, in, very, large, amounts, are, coded, into, bits, data, typically, reside, in, the, storage, in, structures, that, look, completely, different, from, the, way, the, data, look, at, the, conceptual, and, external, levels, but, in, ways, that, attempt, to, optimize, the, best, possible, these, levels, reconstruction, when, needed, by, users, and, programs, as, well, as, for, computing, additional, types, of, needed, information, from, the, data, e, g, when, querying, the, database, some, dbmss, support, specifying, which, character, encoding, was, used, to, store, data, so, multiple, encodings, can, be, used, in, the, same, database, various, low, level, database, storage, structures, are, used, by, the, storage, engine, to, serialize, the, data, model, so, it, can, be, written, to, the, medium, of, choice, techniques, such, as, indexing, may, be, used, to, improve, performance, conventional, storage, is, row, oriented, but, there, are, also, column, oriented, and, correlation, databases, often, storage, redundancy, is, employed, to, increase, performance, a, common, example, is, storing, materialized, views, which, consist, of, frequently, needed, external, views, or, query, results, storing, such, views, saves, the, expensive, computing, them, each, time, they, are, needed, the, downsides, of, materialized, views, are, the, overhead, incurred, when, updating, them, to, keep, them, synchronized, with, their, original, updated, database, data, and, the, cost, of, storage, redundancy, occasionally, a, database, employs, storage, redundancy, by, database, objects, replication, with, one, or, more, copies, to, increase, data, availability, both, to, improve, performance, of, simultaneous, multiple, end, user, accesses, to, the, same, database, object, and, to, provide, resiliency, in, a, case, of, partial, failure, of, a, distributed, database, updates, of, a, replicated, object, need, to, be, synchronized, across, the, object, copies, in, many, cases, the, entire, database, is, replicated, with, data, virtualization, the, data, used, remains, in, its, original, locations, and, real, time, access, is, established, to, allow, analytics, across, multiple, sources, this, can, aid, in, resolving, some, technical, difficulties, such, as, compatibility, problems, when, combining, data, from, various, platforms, lowering, the, risk, of, error, caused, by, faulty, data, and, guaranteeing, that, the, newest, data, is, used, furthermore, avoiding, the, creation, of, a, new, database, containing, personal, information, can, make, it, easier, to, comply, with, privacy, regulations, however, with, data, virtualization, the, connection, to, all, necessary, data, sources, must, be, operational, as, there, is, no, local, copy, of, the, data, which, is, one, of, the, main, drawbacks, of, the, approach, database, security, deals, with, all, various, aspects, of, protecting, the, database, content, its, owners, and, its, users, it, ranges, from, protection, from, intentional, unauthorized, database, uses, to, unintentional, database, accesses, by, unauthorized, entities, e, g, a, person, or, a, computer, program, database, access, control, deals, with, controlling, who, a, person, or, a, certain, computer, program, are, allowed, to, access, what, information, in, the, database, the, information, may, comprise, specific, database, objects, e, g, record, types, specific, records, data, structures, certain, computations, over, certain, objects, e, g, query, types, or, specific, queries, or, using, specific, access, paths, to, the, former, e, g, using, specific, indexes, or, other, data, structures, to, access, information, database, access, controls, are, set, by, special, authorized, by, the, database, owner, personnel, that, uses, dedicated, protected, security, dbms, interfaces, this, may, be, managed, directly, on, an, individual, basis, or, by, the, assignment, of, individuals, and, privileges, to, groups, or, in, the, most, elaborate, models, through, the, assignment, of, individuals, and, groups, to, roles, which, are, then, granted, entitlements, data, security, prevents, unauthorized, users, from, viewing, or, updating, the, database, using, passwords, users, are, allowed, access, to, the, entire, database, or, subsets, of, it, called, subschemas, for, example, an, employee, database, can, contain, all, the, data, about, an, individual, employee, but, one, group, of, users, may, be, authorized, to, view, only, payroll, data, while, others, are, allowed, access, to, only, work, history, and, medical, data, if, the, dbms, provides, a, way, to, interactively, enter, and, update, the, database, as, well, as, interrogate, it, this, capability, allows, for, managing, personal, databases, data, security, in, general, deals, with, protecting, specific, chunks, of, data, both, physically, i, e, from, corruption, or, destruction, or, removal, e, g, see, physical, security, or, the, interpretation, of, them, or, parts, of, them, to, meaningful, information, e, g, by, looking, at, the, strings, of, bits, that, they, comprise, concluding, specific, valid, credit, card, numbers, e, g, see, data, encryption, change, and, access, logging, records, who, accessed, which, attributes, what, was, changed, and, when, it, was, changed, logging, services, allow, for, a, forensic, database, audit, later, by, keeping, a, record, of, access, occurrences, and, changes, sometimes, application, level, code, is, used, to, record, changes, rather, than, leaving, this, in, the, database, monitoring, can, be, set, up, to, attempt, to, detect, security, breaches, therefore, organizations, must, take, database, security, seriously, because, of, the, many, benefits, it, provides, organizations, will, be, safeguarded, from, security, breaches, and, hacking, activities, like, firewall, intrusion, virus, spread, and, ransom, ware, this, helps, in, protecting, the, company, s, essential, information, which, cannot, be, shared, with, outsiders, at, any, cause, database, transactions, can, be, used, to, introduce, some, level, of, fault, tolerance, and, data, integrity, after, recovery, from, a, crash, a, database, transaction, is, a, unit, of, work, typically, encapsulating, a, number, of, operations, over, a, database, e, g, reading, a, database, object, writing, acquiring, or, releasing, a, lock, etc, an, abstraction, supported, in, database, and, also, other, systems, each, transaction, has, well, defined, boundaries, in, terms, of, which, program, code, executions, are, included, in, that, transaction, determined, by, the, transaction, s, programmer, via, special, transaction, commands, the, acronym, acid, describes, some, ideal, properties, of, a, database, transaction, atomicity, consistency, isolation, and, durability, a, database, built, with, one, dbms, is, not, portable, to, another, dbms, i, e, the, other, dbms, cannot, run, it, however, in, some, situations, it, is, desirable, to, migrate, a, database, from, one, dbms, to, another, the, reasons, are, primarily, economical, different, dbmss, may, have, different, total, costs, of, ownership, or, tcos, functional, and, operational, different, dbmss, may, have, different, capabilities, the, migration, involves, the, database, s, transformation, from, one, dbms, type, to, another, the, transformation, should, maintain, if, possible, the, database, related, application, i, e, all, related, application, programs, intact, thus, the, database, s, conceptual, and, external, architectural, levels, should, be, maintained, in, the, transformation, it, may, be, desired, that, also, some, aspects, of, the, architecture, internal, level, are, maintained, a, complex, or, large, database, migration, may, be, a, complicated, and, costly, one, time, project, by, itself, which, should, be, factored, into, the, decision, to, migrate, this, is, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, tools, may, exist, to, help, migration, between, specific, dbmss, typically, a, dbms, vendor, provides, tools, to, help, import, databases, from, other, popular, dbmss, after, designing, a, database, for, an, application, the, next, stage, is, building, the, database, typically, an, appropriate, general, purpose, dbms, can, be, selected, to, be, used, for, this, purpose, a, dbms, provides, the, needed, user, interfaces, to, be, used, by, database, administrators, to, define, the, needed, application, s, data, structures, within, the, dbms, s, respective, data, model, other, user, interfaces, are, used, to, select, needed, dbms, parameters, like, security, related, storage, allocation, parameters, etc, when, the, database, is, ready, all, its, data, structures, and, other, needed, components, are, defined, it, is, typically, populated, with, initial, application, s, data, database, initialization, which, is, typically, a, distinct, project, in, many, cases, using, specialized, dbms, interfaces, that, support, bulk, insertion, before, making, it, operational, in, some, cases, the, database, becomes, operational, while, empty, of, application, data, and, data, are, accumulated, during, its, operation, after, the, database, is, created, initialized, and, populated, it, needs, to, be, maintained, various, database, parameters, may, need, changing, and, the, database, may, need, to, be, tuned, tuning, for, better, performance, application, s, data, structures, may, be, changed, or, added, new, related, application, programs, may, be, written, to, add, to, the, application, s, functionality, etc, sometimes, it, is, desired, to, bring, a, database, back, to, a, previous, state, for, many, reasons, e, g, cases, when, the, database, is, found, corrupted, due, to, a, software, error, or, if, it, has, been, updated, with, erroneous, data, to, achieve, this, a, backup, operation, is, done, occasionally, or, continuously, where, each, desired, database, state, i, e, the, values, of, its, data, and, their, embedding, in, database, s, data, structures, is, kept, within, dedicated, backup, files, many, techniques, exist, to, do, this, effectively, when, it, is, decided, by, a, database, administrator, to, bring, the, database, back, to, this, state, e, g, by, specifying, this, state, by, a, desired, point, in, time, when, the, database, was, in, this, state, these, files, are, used, to, restore, that, state, static, analysis, techniques, for, software, verification, can, be, applied, also, in, the, scenario, of, query, languages, in, particular, the, abstract, interpretation, framework, has, been, extended, to, the, field, of, query, languages, for, relational, databases, as, a, way, to, support, sound, approximation, techniques, the, semantics, of, query, languages, can, be, tuned, according, to, suitable, abstractions, of, the, concrete, domain, of, data, the, abstraction, of, relational, database, systems, has, many, interesting, applications, in, particular, for, security, purposes, such, as, fine, grained, access, control, watermarking, etc, other, dbms, features, might, include, increasingly, there, are, calls, for, a, single, system, that, incorporates, all, of, these, core, functionalities, into, the, same, build, test, and, deployment, framework, for, database, management, and, source, control, borrowing, from, other, developments, in, the, software, industry, some, market, such, offerings, as, devops, for, database, the, first, task, of, a, database, designer, is, to, produce, a, conceptual, data, model, that, reflects, the, structure, of, the, information, to, be, held, in, the, database, a, common, approach, to, this, is, to, develop, an, entity, relationship, model, often, with, the, aid, of, drawing, tools, another, popular, approach, is, the, unified, modeling, language, a, successful, data, model, will, accurately, reflect, the, possible, state, of, the, external, world, being, modeled, for, example, if, people, can, have, more, than, one, phone, number, it, will, allow, this, information, to, be, captured, designing, a, good, conceptual, data, model, requires, a, good, understanding, of, the, application, domain, it, typically, involves, asking, deep, questions, about, the, things, of, interest, to, an, organization, like, can, a, customer, also, be, a, supplier, or, if, a, product, is, sold, with, two, different, forms, of, packaging, are, those, the, same, product, or, different, products, or, if, a, plane, flies, from, new, york, to, dubai, via, frankfurt, is, that, one, flight, or, two, or, maybe, even, three, the, answers, to, these, questions, establish, definitions, of, the, terminology, used, for, entities, customers, products, flights, flight, segments, and, their, relationships, and, attributes, producing, the, conceptual, data, model, sometimes, involves, input, from, business, processes, or, the, analysis, of, workflow, in, the, organization, this, can, help, to, establish, what, information, is, needed, in, the, database, and, what, can, be, left, out, for, example, it, can, help, when, deciding, whether, the, database, needs, to, hold, historic, data, as, well, as, current, data, having, produced, a, conceptual, data, model, that, users, are, happy, with, the, next, stage, is, to, translate, this, into, a, schema, that, implements, the, relevant, data, structures, within, the, database, this, process, is, often, called, logical, database, design, and, the, output, is, a, logical, data, model, expressed, in, the, form, of, a, schema, whereas, the, conceptual, data, model, is, in, theory, at, least, independent, of, the, choice, of, database, technology, the, logical, data, model, will, be, expressed, in, terms, of, a, particular, database, model, supported, by, the, chosen, dbms, the, terms, data, model, and, database, model, are, often, used, interchangeably, but, in, this, article, we, use, data, model, for, the, design, of, a, specific, database, and, database, model, for, the, modeling, notation, used, to, express, that, design, the, most, popular, database, model, for, general, purpose, databases, is, the, relational, model, or, more, precisely, the, relational, model, as, represented, by, the, sql, language, the, process, of, creating, a, logical, database, design, using, this, model, uses, a, methodical, approach, known, as, normalization, the, goal, of, normalization, is, to, ensure, that, each, elementary, fact, is, only, recorded, in, one, place, so, that, insertions, updates, and, deletions, automatically, maintain, consistency, the, final, stage, of, database, design, is, to, make, the, decisions, that, affect, performance, scalability, recovery, security, and, the, like, which, depend, on, the, particular, dbms, this, is, often, called, physical, database, design, and, the, output, is, the, physical, data, model, a, key, goal, during, this, stage, is, data, independence, meaning, that, the, decisions, made, for, performance, optimization, purposes, should, be, invisible, to, end, users, and, applications, there, are, two, types, of, data, independence, physical, data, independence, and, logical, data, independence, physical, design, is, driven, mainly, by, performance, requirements, and, requires, a, good, knowledge, of, the, expected, workload, and, access, patterns, and, a, deep, understanding, of, the, features, offered, by, the, chosen, dbms, another, aspect, of, physical, database, design, is, security, it, involves, both, defining, access, control, to, database, objects, as, well, as, defining, security, levels, and, methods, for, the, data, itself, a, database, model, is, a, type, of, data, model, that, determines, the, logical, structure, of, a, database, and, fundamentally, determines, in, which, manner, data, can, be, stored, organized, and, manipulated, the, most, popular, example, of, a, database, model, is, the, relational, model, or, the, sql, approximation, of, relational, which, uses, a, table, based, format, common, logical, data, models, for, databases, include, an, object, relational, database, combines, the, two, related, structures, physical, data, models, include, other, models, include, specialized, models, are, optimized, for, particular, types, of, data, a, database, management, system, provides, three, views, of, the, database, data, while, there, is, typically, only, one, conceptual, and, internal, view, of, the, data, there, can, be, any, number, of, different, external, views, this, allows, users, to, see, database, information, in, a, more, business, related, way, rather, than, from, a, technical, processing, viewpoint, for, example, a, financial, department, of, a, company, needs, the, payment, details, of, all, employees, as, part, of, the, company, s, expenses, but, does, not, need, details, about, employees, that, are, in, the, interest, of, the, human, resources, department, thus, different, departments, need, different, views, of, the, company, s, database, the, three, level, database, architecture, relates, to, the, concept, of, data, independence, which, was, one, of, the, major, initial, driving, forces, of, the, relational, model, the, idea, is, that, changes, made, at, a, certain, level, do, not, affect, the, view, at, a, higher, level, for, example, changes, in, the, internal, level, do, not, affect, application, programs, written, using, conceptual, level, interfaces, which, reduces, the, impact, of, making, physical, changes, to, improve, performance, the, conceptual, view, provides, a, level, of, indirection, between, internal, and, external, on, the, one, hand, it, provides, a, common, view, of, the, database, independent, of, different, external, view, structures, and, on, the, other, hand, it, abstracts, away, details, of, how, the, data, are, stored, or, managed, internal, level, in, principle, every, level, and, even, every, external, view, can, be, presented, by, a, different, data, model, in, practice, usually, a, given, dbms, uses, the, same, data, model, for, both, the, external, and, the, conceptual, levels, e, g, relational, model, the, internal, level, which, is, hidden, inside, the, dbms, and, depends, on, its, implementation, requires, a, different, level, of, detail, and, uses, its, own, types, of, data, structure, types, database, technology, has, been, an, active, research, topic, since, the, 1960s, both, in, academia, and, in, the, research, and, development, groups, of, companies, for, example, ibm, research, research, activity, includes, theory, and, development, of, prototypes, notable, research, topics, have, included, models, the, atomic, transaction, concept, related, concurrency, control, techniques, query, languages, and, query, optimization, methods, raid, and, more, the, database, research, area, has, several, dedicated, academic, journals, for, example, acm, transactions, on, database, systems, tods, data, and, knowledge, engineering, dke, and, annual, conferences, e, g, acm, sigmod, acm, pods, vldb, ieee, icde
