recycling, is, the, process, of, converting, waste, materials, into, new, materials, and, objects, this, concept, often, includes, the, recovery, of, energy, from, waste, materials, the, recyclability, of, a, material, depends, on, its, ability, to, reacquire, the, properties, it, had, in, its, original, state, it, is, an, alternative, to, conventional, waste, disposal, that, can, save, material, and, help, lower, greenhouse, gas, emissions, it, can, also, prevent, the, waste, of, potentially, useful, materials, and, reduce, the, consumption, of, fresh, raw, materials, reducing, energy, use, air, pollution, from, incineration, and, water, pollution, from, landfilling, recycling, is, a, key, component, of, modern, waste, reduction, and, is, the, third, component, of, the, reduce, reuse, and, recycle, waste, hierarchy, it, promotes, environmental, sustainability, by, removing, raw, material, input, and, redirecting, waste, output, in, the, economic, system, there, are, some, iso, standards, related, to, recycling, such, as, iso, 15270, 2008, for, plastics, waste, and, iso, 14001, 2015, for, environmental, management, control, of, recycling, practice, recyclable, materials, include, many, kinds, of, glass, paper, cardboard, metal, plastic, tires, textiles, batteries, and, electronics, the, composting, and, other, reuse, of, biodegradable, waste, such, as, food, and, garden, waste, is, also, a, form, of, recycling, materials, for, recycling, are, either, delivered, to, a, household, recycling, center, or, picked, up, from, curbside, bins, then, sorted, cleaned, and, reprocessed, into, new, materials, for, manufacturing, new, products, in, ideal, implementations, recycling, a, material, produces, a, fresh, supply, of, the, same, material, for, example, used, office, paper, would, be, converted, into, new, office, paper, and, used, polystyrene, foam, into, new, polystyrene, some, types, of, materials, such, as, metal, cans, can, be, remanufactured, repeatedly, without, losing, their, purity, with, other, materials, this, is, often, difficult, or, too, expensive, compared, with, producing, the, same, product, from, raw, materials, or, other, sources, so, recycling, of, many, products, and, materials, involves, their, reuse, in, producing, different, materials, for, example, paperboard, another, form, of, recycling, is, the, salvage, of, constituent, materials, from, complex, products, due, to, either, their, intrinsic, value, such, as, lead, from, car, batteries, and, gold, from, printed, circuit, boards, or, their, hazardous, nature, e, g, removal, and, reuse, of, mercury, from, thermometers, and, thermostats, reusing, materials, has, been, a, common, practice, for, most, of, human, history, with, recorded, advocates, as, far, back, as, plato, in, the, fourth, century, bc, during, periods, when, resources, were, scarce, archaeological, studies, of, ancient, waste, dumps, show, less, household, waste, such, as, ash, broken, tools, and, pottery, implying, that, more, waste, was, recycled, in, place, of, new, material, however, archaeological, artefacts, made, from, recyclable, material, such, as, glass, or, metal, may, neither, be, the, original, object, nor, resemble, it, with, the, consequence, that, a, successful, ancient, recycling, economy, can, become, invisible, when, recycling, is, synonymous, with, re, melting, rather, than, reuse, in, pre, industrial, times, there, is, evidence, of, scrap, bronze, and, other, metals, being, collected, in, europe, and, melted, down, for, continuous, reuse, paper, recycling, was, first, recorded, in, 1031, when, japanese, shops, sold, repulped, paper, in, britain, dust, and, ash, from, wood, and, coal, fires, was, collected, by, dustmen, and, downcycled, as, a, base, material, for, brick, making, these, forms, of, recycling, were, driven, by, the, economic, advantage, of, obtaining, recycled, materials, instead, of, virgin, material, and, the, need, for, waste, removal, in, ever, more, densely, populated, areas, in, 1813, benjamin, law, developed, the, process, of, turning, rags, into, shoddy, and, mungo, wool, in, batley, yorkshire, which, combined, recycled, fibers, with, virgin, wool, the, west, yorkshire, shoddy, industry, in, towns, such, as, batley, and, dewsbury, lasted, from, the, early, 19th, century, to, at, least, 1914, industrialization, spurred, demand, for, affordable, materials, in, addition, to, rags, ferrous, scrap, metals, were, coveted, as, they, were, cheaper, to, acquire, than, virgin, ore, railroads, purchased, and, sold, scrap, metal, in, the, 19th, century, and, the, growing, steel, and, automobile, industries, purchased, scrap, in, the, early, 20th, century, many, secondary, goods, were, collected, processed, and, sold, by, peddlers, who, scoured, dumps, and, city, streets, for, discarded, machinery, pots, pans, and, other, sources, of, metal, by, world, war, i, thousands, of, such, peddlers, roamed, the, streets, of, american, cities, taking, advantage, of, market, forces, to, recycle, post, consumer, materials, into, industrial, production, manufacturers, of, beverage, bottles, including, schweppes, began, offering, refundable, recycling, deposits, in, great, britain, and, ireland, around, 1800, an, official, recycling, system, with, refundable, deposits, for, bottles, was, established, in, sweden, in, 1884, and, for, aluminum, beverage, cans, in, 1982, it, led, to, recycling, rates, of, 84, 99, depending, on, type, glass, bottles, can, be, refilled, around, 20, times, new, chemical, industries, created, in, the, late, 19th, century, both, invented, new, materials, e, g, bakelite, in, 1907, and, promised, to, transform, valueless, into, valuable, materials, proverbially, you, could, not, make, a, silk, purse, of, a, sow, s, ear, until, the, us, firm, arthur, d, little, published, in, 1921, on, the, making, of, silk, purses, from, sows, ears, its, research, proving, that, when, chemistry, puts, on, overalls, and, gets, down, to, business, new, values, appear, new, and, better, paths, are, opened, to, reach, the, goals, desired, recycling, or, salvage, as, it, was, then, usually, known, was, a, major, issue, for, governments, during, world, war, ii, where, financial, constraints, and, significant, material, shortages, made, it, necessary, to, reuse, goods, and, recycle, materials, these, resource, shortages, caused, by, the, world, wars, and, other, such, world, changing, events, greatly, encouraged, recycling, it, became, necessary, for, most, homes, to, recycle, their, waste, allowing, people, to, make, the, most, of, what, was, available, recycling, household, materials, also, meant, more, resources, were, left, available, for, war, efforts, massive, government, campaigns, such, as, the, national, salvage, campaign, in, britain, and, the, salvage, for, victory, campaign, in, the, united, states, occurred, in, every, fighting, nation, urging, citizens, to, donate, metal, paper, rags, and, rubber, as, a, patriotic, duty, a, considerable, investment, in, recycling, occurred, in, the, 1970s, due, to, rising, energy, costs, recycling, aluminium, uses, only, 5, of, the, energy, of, virgin, production, glass, paper, and, other, metals, have, less, dramatic, but, significant, energy, savings, when, recycled, although, consumer, electronics, have, been, popular, since, the, 1920s, recycling, them, was, almost, unheard, of, until, early, 1991, the, first, electronic, waste, recycling, scheme, was, implemented, in, switzerland, beginning, with, collection, of, old, refrigerators, then, expanding, to, cover, all, devices, when, these, programs, were, created, many, countries, could, not, deal, with, the, sheer, quantity, of, e, waste, or, its, hazardous, nature, and, began, to, export, the, problem, to, developing, countries, without, enforced, environmental, legislation, for, example, recycling, computer, monitors, in, the, united, states, costs, 10, times, more, than, in, china, demand, for, electronic, waste, in, asia, began, to, grow, when, scrapyards, found, they, could, extract, valuable, substances, such, as, copper, silver, iron, silicon, nickel, and, gold, during, the, recycling, process, the, 2000s, saw, a, boom, in, both, the, sales, of, electronic, devices, and, their, growth, as, a, waste, stream, in, 2002, e, waste, grew, faster, than, any, other, type, of, waste, in, the, eu, this, spurred, investment, in, modern, automated, facilities, to, cope, with, the, influx, especially, after, strict, laws, were, implemented, in, 2003, as, of, 2014, the, european, union, had, about, 50, of, world, share, of, waste, and, recycling, industries, with, over, 60, 000, companies, employing, 500, 000, people, and, a, turnover, of, 24, billion, eu, countries, are, mandated, to, reach, recycling, rates, of, at, least, 50, leading, countries, are, already, at, around, 65, the, overall, eu, average, was, 39, in, 2013, and, is, rising, steadily, to, 45, in, 2015, in, 2015, the, united, nations, general, assembly, set, 17, sustainable, development, goals, goal, 12, responsible, consumption, and, production, specifies, 11, targets, to, ensure, sustainable, consumption, and, production, patterns, the, fifth, target, target, 12, 5, is, defined, as, substantially, reducing, waste, generation, by, 2030, indicated, by, the, national, recycling, rate, in, 2018, changes, in, the, recycling, industry, have, sparked, a, global, crisis, on, 31, december, 2017, china, announced, its, national, sword, policy, setting, new, standards, for, imports, of, recyclable, material, and, banning, materials, deemed, too, dirty, or, hazardous, the, new, policy, caused, drastic, disruptions, in, the, global, recycling, market, and, reduced, the, prices, of, scrap, plastic, and, low, grade, paper, exports, of, recyclable, materials, from, g7, countries, to, china, dropped, dramatically, with, many, shifting, to, countries, in, southeast, asia, this, generated, significant, concern, about, the, recycling, industry, s, practices, and, environmental, sustainability, the, abrupt, shift, caused, countries, to, accept, more, materials, than, they, could, process, and, raised, fundamental, questions, about, shipping, waste, from, developed, countries, to, countries, with, few, environmental, regulations, a, practice, that, predated, the, crisis, according, to, the, who, 2023, every, year, millions, of, electrical, and, electronic, devices, are, discarded, a, threat, to, the, environment, and, to, human, health, if, they, are, not, treated, disposed, of, and, recycled, appropriately, common, items, include, computers, e, waste, are, recycled, using, environmentally, unsound, techniques, and, are, likely, stored, in, homes, and, warehouses, dumped, exported, or, recycled, under, inferior, conditions, when, e, waste, is, treated, using, inferior, activities, it, can, release, as, many, as, 1000, different, chemical, substances, including, harmful, neurotoxicants, such, as, lead, copper, slag, is, obtained, when, copper, and, nickel, ores, are, recovered, from, their, source, ores, using, a, pyrometallurgical, process, and, these, ores, usually, contain, other, elements, which, include, iron, cobalt, silica, and, alumina, an, estimate, of, 2, 2, 3, tons, of, copper, slag, is, generated, per, ton, of, copper, produced, resulting, in, around, 24, 6, tons, of, slag, per, year, which, is, regarded, as, waste, environmental, impact, of, slag, include, copper, paralysis, which, leads, to, death, due, to, gastric, hemorrhage, if, ingested, by, humans, it, may, also, cause, acute, dermatitis, upon, skin, exposure, toxicity, may, also, be, uptaken, by, crops, through, soil, consequently, spreading, animals, and, food, sources, and, increasing, the, risk, of, cardiovascular, diseases, cancer, cognitive, impairment, chronic, anemia, and, damage, to, kidneys, bones, nervous, system, brain, and, skin, substituting, gravel, and, grit, in, quarries, has, been, more, cost, effective, due, to, having, its, sources, with, better, proximity, to, consumer, markets, trading, between, countries, and, establishment, of, blast, furnaces, is, helping, increase, slag, utilization, hence, reducing, wastage, and, pollution, economist, steven, landsburg, author, of, a, paper, entitled, why, i, am, not, an, environmentalist, claimed, that, paper, recycling, actually, reduces, tree, populations, he, argues, that, because, paper, companies, have, incentives, to, replenish, their, forests, large, demands, for, paper, lead, to, large, forests, while, reduced, demand, for, paper, leads, to, fewer, farmed, forests, when, foresting, companies, cut, down, trees, more, are, planted, in, their, place, however, such, farmed, forests, are, inferior, to, natural, forests, in, several, ways, farmed, forests, are, not, able, to, fix, the, soil, as, quickly, as, natural, forests, this, can, cause, widespread, soil, erosion, and, often, requiring, large, amounts, of, fertilizer, to, maintain, the, soil, while, containing, little, tree, and, wild, life, biodiversity, compared, to, virgin, forests, also, the, new, trees, planted, are, not, as, big, as, the, trees, that, were, cut, down, and, the, argument, that, there, would, be, more, trees, is, not, compelling, to, forestry, advocates, when, they, are, counting, saplings, in, particular, wood, from, tropical, rainforests, is, rarely, harvested, for, paper, because, of, their, heterogeneity, according, to, the, united, nations, framework, convention, on, climate, change, secretariat, the, overwhelming, direct, cause, of, deforestation, is, subsistence, farming, 48, of, deforestation, and, commercial, agriculture, 32, which, is, linked, to, food, not, paper, production, other, non, conventional, methods, of, material, recycling, like, waste, to, energy, wte, systems, have, garnered, increased, attention, in, the, recent, past, due, to, the, polarizing, nature, of, their, emissions, while, viewed, as, a, sustainable, method, of, capturing, energy, from, material, waste, feedstocks, by, many, others, have, cited, numerous, explanations, for, why, the, technology, has, not, been, scaled, globally, for, a, recycling, program, to, work, a, large, stable, supply, of, recyclable, material, is, crucial, three, legislative, options, have, been, used, to, create, such, supplies, mandatory, recycling, collection, container, deposit, legislation, and, refuse, bans, mandatory, collection, laws, set, recycling, targets, for, cities, usually, in, the, form, that, a, certain, percentage, of, a, material, must, be, diverted, from, the, city, s, waste, stream, by, a, target, date, the, city, is, responsible, for, working, to, meet, this, target, container, deposit, legislation, mandates, refunds, for, the, return, of, certain, containers, typically, glass, plastic, and, metal, when, a, product, in, such, a, container, is, purchased, a, small, surcharge, is, added, that, the, consumer, can, reclaim, when, the, container, is, returned, to, a, collection, point, these, programs, have, succeeded, in, creating, an, average, 80, recycling, rate, despite, such, good, results, the, shift, in, collection, costs, from, local, government, to, industry, and, consumers, has, created, strong, opposition, in, some, areas, for, example, where, manufacturers, bear, the, responsibility, for, recycling, their, products, in, the, european, union, the, weee, directive, requires, producers, of, consumer, electronics, to, reimburse, the, recyclers, costs, an, alternative, way, to, increase, the, supply, of, recyclates, is, to, ban, the, disposal, of, certain, materials, as, waste, often, including, used, oil, old, batteries, tires, and, garden, waste, this, can, create, a, viable, economy, for, the, proper, disposal, of, the, products, care, must, be, taken, that, enough, recycling, services, exist, to, meet, the, supply, or, such, bans, can, create, increased, illegal, dumping, four, forms, of, legislation, have, also, been, used, to, increase, and, maintain, the, demand, for, recycled, materials, minimum, recycled, content, mandates, utilization, rates, procurement, policies, and, recycled, product, labeling, both, minimum, recycled, content, mandates, and, utilization, rates, increase, demand, by, forcing, manufacturers, to, include, recycling, in, their, operations, content, mandates, specify, that, a, certain, percentage, of, a, new, product, must, consist, of, recycled, material, utilization, rates, are, a, more, flexible, option, industries, can, meet, their, recycling, targets, at, any, point, of, their, operations, or, even, contract, out, recycling, in, exchange, for, tradable, credits, opponents, to, these, methods, cite, their, large, increase, in, reporting, requirements, and, claim, that, they, rob, the, industry, of, flexibility, governments, have, used, their, own, purchasing, power, to, increase, recycling, demand, through, procurement, policies, these, policies, are, either, set, asides, which, reserve, a, certain, amount, of, spending, for, recycled, products, or, price, preference, programs, that, provide, larger, budgets, when, recycled, items, are, purchased, additional, regulations, can, target, specific, cases, in, the, united, states, for, example, the, environmental, protection, agency, mandates, the, purchase, of, oil, paper, tires, and, building, insulation, from, recycled, or, re, refined, sources, whenever, possible, the, final, government, regulation, toward, increased, demand, is, recycled, product, labeling, when, producers, are, required, to, label, their, packaging, with, the, amount, of, recycled, material, it, contains, including, the, packaging, consumers, can, make, more, educated, choices, consumers, with, sufficient, buying, power, can, choose, more, environmentally, conscious, options, prompting, producers, to, increase, the, recycled, material, in, their, products, and, increase, demand, standardized, recycling, labeling, can, also, have, a, positive, effect, on, the, supply, of, recyclates, when, it, specifies, how, and, where, the, product, can, be, recycled, recyclate, is, a, raw, material, sent, to, and, processed, in, a, waste, recycling, plant, or, materials, recovery, facility, so, it, can, be, used, in, the, production, of, new, materials, and, products, for, example, plastic, bottles, can, be, made, into, plastic, pellets, and, synthetic, fabrics, the, quality, of, recyclates, is, one, of, the, principal, challenges, for, the, success, of, a, long, term, vision, of, a, green, economy, and, achieving, zero, waste, it, generally, refers, to, how, much, of, it, is, composed, of, target, material, versus, non, target, material, and, other, non, recyclable, material, steel, and, other, metals, have, intrinsically, higher, recyclate, quality, it, is, estimated, that, two, thirds, of, all, new, steel, comes, from, recycled, steel, only, target, material, is, likely, to, be, recycled, so, higher, amounts, of, non, target, and, non, recyclable, materials, can, reduce, the, quantity, of, recycled, products, a, high, proportion, of, non, target, and, non, recyclable, material, can, make, it, more, difficult, to, achieve, high, quality, recycling, and, if, recyclate, is, of, poor, quality, it, is, more, likely, to, end, up, being, down, cycled, or, in, more, extreme, cases, sent, to, other, recovery, options, or, landfilled, for, example, to, facilitate, the, remanufacturing, of, clear, glass, products, there, are, tight, restrictions, for, colored, glass, entering, the, re, melt, process, another, example, is, the, downcycling, of, plastic, where, products, such, as, plastic, food, packaging, are, often, downcycled, into, lower, quality, products, and, do, not, get, recycled, into, the, same, plastic, food, packaging, the, quality, of, recyclate, not, only, supports, high, quality, recycling, but, it, can, also, deliver, significant, environmental, benefits, by, reducing, reusing, and, keeping, products, out, of, landfills, high, quality, recycling, can, support, economic, growth, by, maximizing, the, value, of, waste, material, higher, income, levels, from, the, sale, of, quality, recyclates, can, return, value, significant, to, local, governments, households, and, businesses, pursuing, high, quality, recycling, can, also, promote, consumer, and, business, confidence, in, the, waste, and, resource, management, sector, and, may, encourage, investment, in, it, there, are, many, actions, along, the, recycling, supply, chain, each, of, which, can, affect, recyclate, quality, waste, producers, who, place, non, target, and, non, recyclable, wastes, in, recycling, collections, can, affect, the, quality, of, final, recyclate, streams, and, require, extra, efforts, to, discard, those, materials, at, later, stages, in, the, recycling, process, different, collection, systems, can, induce, different, levels, of, contamination, when, multiple, materials, are, collected, together, extra, effort, is, required, to, sort, them, into, separate, streams, and, can, significantly, reduce, the, quality, of, the, final, products, transportation, and, the, compaction, of, materials, can, also, make, this, more, difficult, despite, improvements, in, technology, and, quality, of, recyclate, sorting, facilities, are, still, not, 100, effective, in, separating, materials, when, materials, are, stored, outside, where, they, can, become, wet, can, also, cause, problems, for, re, processors, further, sorting, steps, may, be, required, to, satisfactorily, reduce, the, amount, of, non, target, and, non, recyclable, material, scotland, s, recyclate, quality, action, plan, proposes, a, number, of, actions, the, scottish, government, wants, to, take, to, increase, the, quality, of, materials, collected, for, recycling, and, sorted, at, recovery, facilities, before, it, is, exported, or, sold, on, the, reprocessing, market, its, objectives, are, to, the, plan, focuses, on, three, key, areas, with, 14, actions, to, increase, the, quality, of, materials, collected, sorted, and, presented, to, the, processing, market, in, scotland, these, areas, are, a, number, of, systems, have, been, implemented, to, collect, recyclates, from, the, general, waste, stream, occupying, different, places, on, the, spectrum, of, trade, off, between, public, convenience, and, government, ease, and, expense, the, three, main, categories, of, collection, are, drop, off, centers, buy, back, centers, and, curbside, collection, about, two, thirds, of, the, cost, of, recycling, is, incurred, in, the, collection, phase, curbside, collection, encompasses, many, subtly, different, systems, which, differ, mostly, on, where, in, the, process, the, recyclates, are, sorted, and, cleaned, the, main, categories, are, mixed, waste, collection, commingled, recyclables, and, source, separation, a, waste, collection, vehicle, generally, picks, up, the, waste, in, mixed, waste, collection, recyclates, are, collected, mixed, with, the, rest, of, the, waste, and, the, desired, materials, are, sorted, out, and, cleaned, at, a, central, sorting, facility, this, results, in, a, large, amount, of, recyclable, waste, especially, paper, being, too, soiled, to, reprocess, but, has, advantages, as, well, the, city, need, not, pay, for, the, separate, collection, of, recyclates, no, public, education, is, needed, and, any, changes, to, the, recyclability, of, certain, materials, are, implemented, where, sorting, occurs, in, a, commingled, or, single, stream, system, recyclables, are, mixed, but, kept, separate, from, non, recyclable, waste, this, greatly, reduces, the, need, for, post, collection, cleaning, but, requires, public, education, on, what, materials, are, recyclable, source, separation, is, the, other, extreme, where, each, material, is, cleaned, and, sorted, prior, to, collection, it, requires, the, least, post, collection, sorting, and, produces, the, purest, recyclates, however, it, incurs, additional, operating, costs, for, collecting, each, material, and, requires, extensive, public, education, to, avoid, recyclate, contamination, in, oregon, usa, oregon, deq, surveyed, multi, family, property, managers, about, half, of, them, reported, problems, including, contamination, of, recyclables, due, to, trespassers, such, as, transients, gaining, access, to, collection, areas, source, separation, used, to, be, the, preferred, method, due, to, the, high, cost, of, sorting, commingled, mixed, waste, collection, however, advances, in, sorting, technology, have, substantially, lowered, this, overhead, and, many, areas, that, had, developed, source, separation, programs, have, switched, to, what, is, called, co, mingled, collection, at, buy, back, centers, separated, cleaned, recyclates, are, purchased, providing, a, clear, incentive, for, use, and, creating, a, stable, supply, the, post, processed, material, can, then, be, sold, if, profitable, this, conserves, the, emission, of, greenhouse, gases, if, unprofitable, it, increases, their, emission, buy, back, centres, generally, need, government, subsidies, to, be, viable, according, to, a, 1993, report, by, the, u, s, national, waste, recycling, association, it, costs, an, average, 50, to, process, a, ton, of, material, that, can, be, resold, for, 30, drop, off, centers, require, the, waste, producer, to, carry, recyclates, to, a, central, location, either, an, installed, or, mobile, collection, station, or, the, reprocessing, plant, itself, they, are, the, easiest, type, of, collection, to, establish, but, suffer, from, low, and, unpredictable, throughput, for, some, waste, materials, such, as, plastic, recent, technical, devices, called, recyclebots, enable, a, form, of, distributed, recycling, called, dram, distributed, recycling, additive, manufacturing, preliminary, life, cycle, analysis, lca, indicates, that, such, distributed, recycling, of, hdpe, to, make, filament, for, 3d, printers, in, rural, regions, consumes, less, energy, than, using, virgin, resin, or, using, conventional, recycling, processes, with, their, associated, transportation, another, form, of, distributed, recycling, mixes, waste, plastic, with, sand, to, make, bricks, in, africa, several, studies, have, looked, at, the, properties, of, recycled, waste, plastic, and, sand, bricks, the, composite, pavers, can, be, sold, at, 100, profit, while, employing, workers, at, 1, 5, the, minimum, wage, in, the, west, african, region, where, distributed, recycling, has, the, potential, to, produce, 19, million, pavement, tiles, from, 28, 000, tons, of, plastic, water, sachets, annually, in, ghana, nigeria, and, liberia, this, has, also, been, done, with, covid19, masks, once, commingled, recyclates, are, collected, and, delivered, to, a, materials, recovery, facility, the, materials, must, be, sorted, this, is, done, in, a, series, of, stages, many, of, which, involve, automated, processes, enabling, a, truckload, of, material, to, be, fully, sorted, in, less, than, an, hour, some, plants, can, now, sort, materials, automatically, this, is, known, as, single, stream, recycling, automatic, sorting, may, be, aided, by, robotics, and, machine, learning, in, plants, a, variety, of, materials, is, sorted, including, paper, different, types, of, plastics, glass, metals, food, scraps, and, most, types, of, batteries, a, 30, increase, in, recycling, rates, has, been, seen, in, areas, with, these, plants, in, the, us, there, are, over, 300, materials, recovery, facilities, initially, commingled, recyclates, are, removed, from, the, collection, vehicle, and, placed, on, a, conveyor, belt, spread, out, in, a, single, layer, large, pieces, of, corrugated, fiberboard, and, plastic, bags, are, removed, by, hand, at, this, stage, as, they, can, cause, later, machinery, to, jam, next, automated, machinery, such, as, disk, screens, and, air, classifiers, separate, the, recyclates, by, weight, splitting, lighter, paper, and, plastic, from, heavier, glass, and, metal, cardboard, is, removed, from, mixed, paper, and, the, most, common, types, of, plastic, pet, 1, and, hdpe, 2, are, collected, so, these, materials, can, be, diverted, into, the, proper, collection, channels, this, is, usually, done, by, hand, but, in, some, sorting, centers, spectroscopic, scanners, are, used, to, differentiate, between, types, of, paper, and, plastic, based, on, their, absorbed, wavelengths, plastics, tend, to, be, incompatible, with, each, other, due, to, differences, in, chemical, composition, their, polymer, molecules, repel, each, other, similar, to, oil, and, water, strong, magnets, are, used, to, separate, out, ferrous, metals, such, as, iron, steel, and, tin, cans, non, ferrous, metals, are, ejected, by, magnetic, eddy, currents, a, rotating, magnetic, field, induces, an, electric, current, around, aluminum, cans, creating, an, eddy, current, inside, the, cans, that, is, repulsed, by, a, large, magnetic, field, ejecting, the, cans, from, the, stream, finally, glass, is, sorted, according, to, its, color, brown, amber, green, or, clear, it, may, be, sorted, either, by, hand, or, by, a, machine, that, uses, colored, filters, to, detect, colors, glass, fragments, smaller, than, 10, millimetres, 0, 39, in, cannot, be, sorted, automatically, and, are, mixed, together, as, glass, fines, in, 2003, san, francisco, s, department, of, the, environment, set, a, citywide, goal, of, zero, waste, by, 2020, san, francisco, s, refuse, hauler, recology, operates, an, effective, recyclables, sorting, facility, that, has, helped, the, city, reach, a, record, breaking, landfill, diversion, rate, of, 80, as, of, 2021, other, american, cities, including, los, angeles, have, achieved, similar, rates, although, many, government, programs, concentrate, on, recycling, at, home, 64, of, waste, in, the, united, kingdom, is, generated, by, industry, the, focus, of, many, recycling, programs, in, industry, is, their, cost, effectiveness, the, ubiquitous, nature, of, cardboard, packaging, makes, cardboard, a, common, waste, product, recycled, by, companies, that, deal, heavily, in, packaged, goods, such, as, retail, stores, warehouses, and, goods, distributors, other, industries, deal, in, niche, and, specialized, products, depending, on, the, waste, materials, they, handle, glass, lumber, wood, pulp, and, paper, manufacturers, all, deal, directly, in, commonly, recycled, materials, however, independent, tire, dealers, may, collect, and, recycle, rubber, tires, for, a, profit, the, waste, produced, from, burning, coal, in, a, coal, fired, power, station, is, often, called, fuel, ash, or, fly, ash, in, the, united, states, it, is, a, very, useful, material, and, used, in, concrete, construction, it, exhibits, pozzolanic, activity, levels, of, metals, recycling, are, generally, low, in, 2010, the, international, resource, panel, hosted, by, the, united, nations, environment, programme, unep, published, reports, on, metal, stocks, and, their, recycling, rates, it, reported, that, the, increase, in, the, use, of, metals, during, the, 20th, and, into, the, 21st, century, has, led, to, a, substantial, shift, in, metal, stocks, from, below, ground, to, use, in, above, ground, applications, within, society, for, example, in, the, us, in, use, copper, grew, from, 73, to, 238, kg, per, capita, between, 1932, 1999, the, report, s, authors, observed, that, as, metals, are, inherently, recyclable, metal, stocks, in, society, can, serve, as, huge, above, ground, mines, the, term, urban, mining, has, thus, been, coined, however, they, found, that, the, recycling, rates, of, many, metals, are, low, they, warned, that, the, recycling, rates, of, some, rare, metals, used, in, applications, such, as, mobile, phones, battery, packs, for, hybrid, cars, and, fuel, cells, are, so, low, that, unless, future, end, of, life, recycling, rates, are, dramatically, increased, these, critical, metals, will, become, unavailable, for, use, in, modern, technology, the, military, recycles, some, metals, the, u, s, navy, s, ship, disposal, program, uses, ship, breaking, to, reclaim, the, steel, of, old, vessels, ships, may, also, be, sunk, to, create, artificial, reefs, uranium, is, a, dense, metal, that, has, qualities, superior, to, lead, and, titanium, for, many, military, and, industrial, uses, uranium, left, over, from, processing, it, into, nuclear, weapons, and, fuel, for, nuclear, reactors, is, called, depleted, uranium, and, is, used, by, all, branches, of, the, u, s, military, for, the, development, of, such, things, as, armor, piercing, shells, and, shielding, the, construction, industry, may, recycle, concrete, and, old, road, surface, pavement, selling, these, materials, for, profit, some, rapidly, growing, industries, particularly, the, renewable, energy, and, solar, photovoltaic, technology, industries, are, proactively, creating, recycling, policies, even, before, their, waste, streams, have, considerable, volume, anticipating, future, demand, recycling, of, plastics, is, more, difficult, as, most, programs, are, not, able, to, reach, the, necessary, level, of, quality, recycling, of, pvc, often, results, in, downcycling, of, the, material, which, means, only, products, of, lower, quality, standard, can, be, made, with, the, recycled, material, e, waste, is, a, growing, problem, accounting, for, 20, 50, million, metric, tons, of, global, waste, per, year, according, to, the, epa, it, is, also, the, fastest, growing, waste, stream, in, the, eu, many, recyclers, do, not, recycle, e, waste, responsibly, after, the, cargo, barge, khian, sea, dumped, 14, 000, metric, tons, of, toxic, ash, in, haiti, the, basel, convention, was, formed, to, stem, the, flow, of, hazardous, substances, into, poorer, countries, they, created, the, e, stewards, certification, to, ensure, that, recyclers, are, held, to, the, highest, standards, for, environmental, responsibility, and, to, help, consumers, identify, responsible, recyclers, it, operates, alongside, other, prominent, legislation, such, as, the, waste, electrical, and, electronic, equipment, directive, of, the, eu, and, the, united, states, national, computer, recycling, act, to, prevent, poisonous, chemicals, from, entering, waterways, and, the, atmosphere, in, the, recycling, process, television, sets, monitors, cell, phones, and, computers, are, typically, tested, for, reuse, and, repaired, if, broken, they, may, be, disassembled, for, parts, still, having, high, value, if, labor, is, cheap, enough, other, e, waste, is, shredded, to, pieces, roughly, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, in, size, and, manually, checked, to, separate, toxic, batteries, and, capacitors, which, contain, poisonous, metals, the, remaining, pieces, are, further, shredded, to, 10, millimetres, 0, 39, in, particles, and, passed, under, a, magnet, to, remove, ferrous, metals, an, eddy, current, ejects, non, ferrous, metals, which, are, sorted, by, density, either, by, a, centrifuge, or, vibrating, plates, precious, metals, can, be, dissolved, in, acid, sorted, and, smelted, into, ingots, the, remaining, glass, and, plastic, fractions, are, separated, by, density, and, sold, to, re, processors, television, sets, and, monitors, must, be, manually, disassembled, to, remove, lead, from, crts, and, the, mercury, backlight, from, lcds, vehicles, solar, panels, and, wind, turbines, can, also, be, recycled, they, often, contain, rare, earth, elements, ree, and, or, other, critical, raw, materials, for, electric, car, production, large, amounts, of, ree, s, are, typically, required, whereas, many, critical, raw, elements, and, ree, s, can, be, recovered, environmental, engineer, phillipe, bihouix, archived, 6, september, 2021, at, the, wayback, machine, reports, that, recycling, of, indium, gallium, germanium, selenium, and, tantalum, is, still, very, difficult, and, their, recycling, rates, are, very, low, plastic, recycling, is, the, process, of, recovering, scrap, or, waste, plastic, and, reprocessing, the, material, into, useful, products, sometimes, completely, different, in, form, from, their, original, state, for, instance, this, could, mean, melting, down, soft, drink, bottles, and, then, casting, them, as, plastic, chairs, and, tables, for, some, types, of, plastic, the, same, piece, of, plastic, can, only, be, recycled, about, 2, 3, times, before, its, quality, decreases, to, the, point, where, it, can, no, longer, be, used, some, plastics, are, remelted, to, form, new, plastic, objects, for, example, pet, water, bottles, can, be, converted, into, polyester, destined, for, clothing, a, disadvantage, of, this, type, of, recycling, is, that, the, molecular, weight, of, the, polymer, can, change, further, and, the, levels, of, unwanted, substances, in, the, plastic, can, increase, with, each, remelt, a, commercial, built, recycling, facility, was, sent, to, the, international, space, station, in, late, 2019, the, facility, takes, in, plastic, waste, and, unneeded, plastic, parts, and, physically, converts, them, into, spools, of, feedstock, for, the, space, station, additive, manufacturing, facility, used, for, in, space, 3d, printing, for, some, polymers, it, is, possible, to, convert, them, back, into, monomers, for, example, pet, can, be, treated, with, an, alcohol, and, a, catalyst, to, form, a, dialkyl, terephthalate, the, terephthalate, diester, can, be, used, with, ethylene, glycol, to, form, a, new, polyester, polymer, thus, making, it, possible, to, use, the, pure, polymer, again, in, 2019, eastman, chemical, company, announced, initiatives, of, methanolysis, and, syngas, designed, to, handle, a, greater, variety, of, used, material, another, process, involves, the, conversion, of, assorted, polymers, into, petroleum, by, a, much, less, precise, thermal, depolymerization, process, such, a, process, would, be, able, to, accept, almost, any, polymer, or, mix, of, polymers, including, thermoset, materials, such, as, vulcanized, rubber, tires, and, the, biopolymers, in, feathers, and, other, agricultural, waste, like, natural, petroleum, the, chemicals, produced, can, be, used, as, fuels, or, as, feedstock, a, resem, technology, plant, of, this, type, in, carthage, missouri, us, uses, turkey, waste, as, input, material, gasification, is, a, similar, process, but, is, not, technically, recycling, since, polymers, are, not, likely, to, become, the, result, plastic, pyrolysis, can, convert, petroleum, based, waste, streams, such, as, plastics, into, quality, fuels, carbons, given, below, is, the, list, of, suitable, plastic, raw, materials, for, pyrolysis, the, ideal, recycling, process, can, be, differentiated, into, three, loops, one, for, manufacture, production, waste, recycling, and, two, for, disposal, of, the, product, product, and, material, recycling, the, product, s, manufacturing, phase, which, consists, of, material, processing, and, fabrication, forms, the, production, waste, recycling, loop, industrial, waste, materials, are, fed, back, into, and, reused, in, the, same, production, process, the, product, s, disposal, process, requires, two, recycling, loops, product, recycling, and, material, recycling, the, product, or, product, parts, are, reused, in, the, product, recycling, phase, this, happens, in, one, of, two, ways, the, product, is, used, retaining, the, product, functionality, reuse, or, the, product, continues, to, be, used, but, with, altered, functionality, further, use, the, product, design, is, unmodified, or, only, slightly, modified, in, both, scenarios, product, disassembly, requires, material, recycling, where, product, materials, are, recovered, and, recycled, ideally, the, materials, are, processed, so, they, can, flow, back, into, the, production, process, in, order, to, meet, recyclers, needs, while, providing, manufacturers, a, consistent, uniform, system, a, coding, system, was, developed, the, recycling, code, for, plastics, was, introduced, in, 1988, by, the, plastics, industry, through, the, society, of, the, plastics, industry, because, municipal, recycling, programs, traditionally, have, targeted, packaging, primarily, bottles, and, containers, the, resin, coding, system, offered, a, means, of, identifying, the, resin, content, of, bottles, and, containers, commonly, found, in, the, residential, waste, stream, in, the, united, states, plastic, products, are, printed, with, numbers, 1, 7, depending, on, the, type, of, resin, type, 1, polyethylene, terephthalate, is, commonly, found, in, soft, drink, and, water, bottles, type, 2, high, density, polyethylene, is, found, in, most, hard, plastics, such, as, milk, jugs, laundry, detergent, bottles, and, some, dishware, type, 3, polyvinyl, chloride, includes, items, such, as, shampoo, bottles, shower, curtains, hula, hoops, credit, cards, wire, jacketing, medical, equipment, siding, and, piping, type, 4, low, density, polyethylene, is, found, in, shopping, bags, squeezable, bottles, tote, bags, clothing, furniture, and, carpet, type, 5, is, polypropylene, and, makes, up, syrup, bottles, straws, tupperware, and, some, automotive, parts, type, 6, is, polystyrene, and, makes, up, meat, trays, egg, cartons, clamshell, containers, and, compact, disc, cases, type, 7, includes, all, other, plastics, such, as, bulletproof, materials, 3, and, 5, gallon, water, bottles, cell, phone, and, tablet, frames, safety, goggles, and, sunglasses, having, a, recycling, code, or, the, chasing, arrows, logo, on, a, material, is, not, an, automatic, indicator, that, a, material, is, recyclable, but, rather, an, explanation, of, what, the, material, is, types, 1, and, 2, are, the, most, commonly, recycled, in, addition, to, environmental, impact, there, is, debate, over, whether, recycling, is, economically, efficient, according, to, a, natural, resources, defense, council, study, waste, collection, and, landfill, disposal, creates, less, than, one, job, per, 1, 000, tons, of, waste, material, managed, in, contrast, the, collection, processing, and, manufacturing, of, recycled, materials, creates, 6, 13, or, more, jobs, per, 1, 000, tons, according, to, the, u, s, recycling, economic, informational, study, there, are, over, 50, 000, recycling, establishments, that, have, created, over, a, million, jobs, in, the, us, the, national, waste, recycling, association, nwra, reported, in, may, 2015, that, recycling, and, waste, made, a, 6, 7, billion, economic, impact, in, ohio, u, s, and, employed, 14, 000, people, economists, would, classify, this, extra, labor, used, as, a, cost, rather, than, a, benefit, since, these, workers, could, have, been, employed, elsewhere, the, cost, effectiveness, of, creating, these, additional, jobs, remains, unclear, sometimes, cities, have, found, recycling, saves, resources, compared, to, other, methods, of, disposal, of, waste, two, years, after, new, york, city, declared, that, implementing, recycling, programs, would, be, a, drain, on, the, city, new, york, city, leaders, realized, that, an, efficient, recycling, system, could, save, the, city, over, 20, million, municipalities, often, see, fiscal, benefits, from, implementing, recycling, programs, largely, due, to, the, reduced, landfill, costs, a, study, conducted, by, the, technical, university, of, denmark, according, to, the, economist, found, that, in, 83, percent, of, cases, recycling, is, the, most, efficient, method, to, dispose, of, household, waste, however, a, 2004, assessment, by, the, danish, environmental, assessment, institute, concluded, that, incineration, was, the, most, effective, method, for, disposing, of, drink, containers, even, aluminium, ones, fiscal, efficiency, is, separate, from, economic, efficiency, economic, analysis, of, recycling, does, not, include, what, economists, call, externalities, unpriced, costs, and, benefits, that, accrue, to, individuals, outside, of, private, transactions, examples, include, less, air, pollution, and, greenhouse, gases, from, incineration, and, less, waste, leaching, from, landfills, without, mechanisms, such, as, taxes, or, subsidies, businesses, and, consumers, following, their, private, benefit, would, ignore, externalities, despite, the, costs, imposed, on, society, if, landfills, and, incinerator, pollution, is, inadequately, regulated, these, methods, of, waste, disposal, appear, cheaper, than, they, really, are, because, part, of, their, cost, is, the, pollution, imposed, on, people, nearby, thus, advocates, have, pushed, for, legislation, to, increase, demand, for, recycled, materials, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, has, concluded, in, favor, of, recycling, saying, that, recycling, efforts, reduced, the, country, s, carbon, emissions, by, a, net, 49, million, metric, tonnes, in, 2005, in, the, united, kingdom, the, waste, and, resources, action, programme, stated, that, great, britain, s, recycling, efforts, reduce, co, 2, emissions, by, 10, 15, million, tonnes, a, year, the, question, for, economic, efficiency, is, whether, this, reduction, is, worth, the, extra, cost, of, recycling, and, thus, makes, the, artificial, demand, creates, by, legislation, worthwhile, certain, requirements, must, be, met, for, recycling, to, be, economically, feasible, and, environmentally, effective, these, include, an, adequate, source, of, recyclates, a, system, to, extract, those, recyclates, from, the, waste, stream, a, nearby, factory, capable, of, reprocessing, the, recyclates, and, a, potential, demand, for, the, recycled, products, these, last, two, requirements, are, often, overlooked, without, both, an, industrial, market, for, production, using, the, collected, materials, and, a, consumer, market, for, the, manufactured, goods, recycling, is, incomplete, and, in, fact, only, collection, free, market, economist, julian, simon, remarked, there, are, three, ways, society, can, organize, waste, disposal, a, commanding, b, guiding, by, tax, and, subsidy, and, c, leaving, it, to, the, individual, and, the, market, these, principles, appear, to, divide, economic, thinkers, today, frank, ackerman, favours, a, high, level, of, government, intervention, to, provide, recycling, services, he, believes, that, recycling, s, benefit, cannot, be, effectively, quantified, by, traditional, laissez, faire, economics, allen, hershkowitz, supports, intervention, saying, that, it, is, a, public, service, equal, to, education, and, policing, he, argues, that, manufacturers, should, shoulder, more, of, the, burden, of, waste, disposal, paul, calcott, and, margaret, walls, advocate, the, second, option, a, deposit, refund, scheme, and, a, small, refuse, charge, would, encourage, recycling, but, not, at, the, expense, of, illegal, dumping, thomas, c, kinnaman, concludes, that, a, landfill, tax, would, force, consumers, companies, and, councils, to, recycle, more, most, free, market, thinkers, detest, subsidy, and, intervention, arguing, that, they, waste, resources, the, general, argument, is, that, if, cities, charge, the, full, cost, of, garbage, collection, private, companies, can, profitably, recycle, any, materials, for, which, the, benefit, of, recycling, exceeds, the, cost, e, g, aluminum, and, do, not, recycle, other, materials, for, which, the, benefit, is, less, than, the, cost, e, g, glass, cities, on, the, other, hand, often, recycle, even, when, they, not, only, do, not, receive, enough, for, the, paper, or, plastic, to, pay, for, its, collection, but, must, actually, pay, private, recycling, companies, to, take, it, off, of, their, hands, terry, anderson, and, donald, leal, think, that, all, recycling, programmes, should, be, privately, operated, and, therefore, would, only, operate, if, the, money, saved, by, recycling, exceeds, its, costs, daniel, k, benjamin, argues, that, it, wastes, people, s, resources, and, lowers, the, wealth, of, a, population, he, notes, that, recycling, can, cost, a, city, more, than, twice, as, much, as, landfills, that, in, the, united, states, landfills, are, so, heavily, regulated, that, their, pollution, effects, are, negligible, and, that, the, recycling, process, also, generates, pollution, and, uses, energy, which, may, or, may, not, be, less, than, from, virgin, production, certain, countries, trade, in, unprocessed, recyclates, some, have, complained, that, the, ultimate, fate, of, recyclates, sold, to, another, country, is, unknown, and, they, may, end, up, in, landfills, instead, of, being, reprocessed, according, to, one, report, in, america, 50, 80, percent, of, computers, destined, for, recycling, are, actually, not, recycled, there, are, reports, of, illegal, waste, imports, to, china, being, dismantled, and, recycled, solely, for, monetary, gain, without, consideration, for, workers, health, or, environmental, damage, although, the, chinese, government, has, banned, these, practices, it, has, not, been, able, to, eradicate, them, in, 2008, the, prices, of, recyclable, waste, plummeted, before, rebounding, in, 2009, cardboard, averaged, about, 53, tonne, from, 2004, to, 2008, dropped, to, 19, tonne, and, then, went, up, to, 59, tonne, in, may, 2009, pet, plastic, averaged, about, 156, tonne, dropped, to, 75, tonne, and, then, moved, up, to, 195, tonne, in, may, 2009, certain, regions, have, difficulty, using, or, exporting, as, much, of, a, material, as, they, recycle, this, problem, is, most, prevalent, with, glass, both, britain, and, the, u, s, import, large, quantities, of, wine, bottled, in, green, glass, though, much, of, this, glass, is, sent, to, be, recycled, outside, the, american, midwest, there, is, not, enough, wine, production, to, use, all, of, the, reprocessed, material, the, extra, must, be, downcycled, into, building, materials, or, re, inserted, into, the, regular, waste, stream, similarly, the, northwestern, united, states, has, difficulty, finding, markets, for, recycled, newspaper, given, the, large, number, of, pulp, mills, in, the, region, as, well, as, the, proximity, to, asian, markets, in, other, areas, of, the, u, s, however, demand, for, used, newsprint, has, seen, wide, fluctuation, in, some, u, s, states, a, program, called, recyclebank, pays, people, to, recycle, receiving, money, from, local, municipalities, for, the, reduction, in, landfill, space, that, must, be, purchased, it, uses, a, single, stream, process, in, which, all, material, is, automatically, sorted, critics, dispute, the, net, economic, and, environmental, benefits, of, recycling, over, its, costs, and, suggest, that, proponents, of, recycling, often, make, matters, worse, and, suffer, from, confirmation, bias, specifically, critics, argue, that, the, costs, and, energy, used, in, collection, and, transportation, detract, from, and, outweigh, the, costs, and, energy, saved, in, the, production, process, also, that, the, jobs, produced, by, the, recycling, industry, can, be, a, poor, trade, for, the, jobs, lost, in, logging, mining, and, other, industries, associated, with, production, and, that, materials, such, as, paper, pulp, can, only, be, recycled, a, few, times, before, material, degradation, prevents, further, recycling, journalist, john, tierney, notes, that, it, is, generally, more, expensive, for, municipalities, to, recycle, waste, from, households, than, to, send, it, to, a, landfill, and, that, recycling, may, be, the, most, wasteful, activity, in, modern, america, much, of, the, difficulty, inherent, in, recycling, comes, from, the, fact, that, most, products, are, not, designed, with, recycling, in, mind, the, concept, of, sustainable, design, aims, to, solve, this, problem, and, was, laid, out, in, the, 2002, book, cradle, to, cradle, remaking, the, way, we, make, things, by, architect, william, mcdonough, and, chemist, michael, braungart, they, suggest, that, every, product, and, all, packaging, it, requires, should, have, a, complete, closed, loop, cycle, mapped, out, for, each, component, a, way, in, which, every, component, either, returns, to, the, natural, ecosystem, through, biodegradation, or, is, recycled, indefinitely, complete, recycling, is, impossible, from, a, practical, standpoint, in, summary, substitution, and, recycling, strategies, only, delay, the, depletion, of, non, renewable, stocks, and, therefore, may, buy, time, in, the, transition, to, true, or, strong, sustainability, which, ultimately, is, only, guaranteed, in, an, economy, based, on, renewable, resources, 21, while, recycling, diverts, waste, from, entering, directly, into, landfill, sites, current, recycling, misses, the, dispersive, components, critics, believe, that, complete, recycling, is, impracticable, as, highly, dispersed, wastes, become, so, diluted, that, the, energy, needed, for, their, recovery, becomes, increasingly, excessive, as, with, environmental, economics, care, must, be, taken, to, ensure, a, complete, view, of, the, costs, and, benefits, involved, for, example, paperboard, packaging, for, food, products, is, more, easily, recycled, than, most, plastic, but, is, heavier, to, ship, and, may, result, in, more, waste, from, spoilage, the, amount, of, energy, saved, through, recycling, depends, upon, the, material, being, recycled, and, the, type, of, energy, accounting, that, is, used, correct, accounting, for, this, saved, energy, can, be, accomplished, with, life, cycle, analysis, using, real, energy, values, and, in, addition, exergy, which, is, a, measure, of, how, much, useful, energy, can, be, used, in, general, it, takes, far, less, energy, to, produce, a, unit, mass, of, recycled, materials, than, it, does, to, make, the, same, mass, of, virgin, materials, some, scholars, use, emergy, spelled, with, an, m, analysis, for, example, budgets, for, the, amount, of, energy, of, one, kind, exergy, that, is, required, to, make, or, transform, things, into, another, kind, of, product, or, service, emergy, calculations, take, into, account, economics, that, can, alter, pure, physics, based, results, using, emergy, life, cycle, analysis, researchers, have, concluded, that, materials, with, large, refining, costs, have, the, greatest, potential, for, high, recycle, benefits, moreover, the, highest, emergy, efficiency, accrues, from, systems, geared, toward, material, recycling, where, materials, are, engineered, to, recycle, back, into, their, original, form, and, purpose, followed, by, adaptive, reuse, systems, where, the, materials, are, recycled, into, a, different, kind, of, product, and, then, by, product, reuse, systems, where, parts, of, the, products, are, used, to, make, an, entirely, different, product, the, energy, information, administration, eia, states, on, its, website, that, a, paper, mill, uses, 40, percent, less, energy, to, make, paper, from, recycled, paper, than, it, does, to, make, paper, from, fresh, lumber, some, critics, argue, that, it, takes, more, energy, to, produce, recycled, products, than, it, does, to, dispose, of, them, in, traditional, landfill, methods, since, the, curbside, collection, of, recyclables, often, requires, a, second, waste, truck, however, recycling, proponents, point, out, that, a, second, timber, or, logging, truck, is, eliminated, when, paper, is, collected, for, recycling, so, the, net, energy, consumption, is, the, same, an, emergy, life, cycle, analysis, on, recycling, revealed, that, fly, ash, aluminum, recycled, concrete, aggregate, recycled, plastic, and, steel, yield, higher, efficiency, ratios, whereas, the, recycling, of, lumber, generates, the, lowest, recycle, benefit, ratio, hence, the, specific, nature, of, the, recycling, process, the, methods, used, to, analyse, the, process, and, the, products, involved, affect, the, energy, savings, budgets, it, is, difficult, to, determine, the, amount, of, energy, consumed, or, produced, in, waste, disposal, processes, in, broader, ecological, terms, where, causal, relations, dissipate, into, complex, networks, of, material, and, energy, flow, ities, do, not, follow, all, the, strategies, of, ecosystem, development, biogeochemical, paths, become, fairly, straight, relative, to, wild, ecosystems, with, reduced, recycling, resulting, in, large, flows, of, waste, and, low, total, energy, efficiencies, by, contrast, in, wild, ecosystems, one, population, s, wastes, are, another, population, s, resources, and, succession, results, in, efficient, exploitation, of, available, resources, however, even, modernized, cities, may, still, be, in, the, earliest, stages, of, a, succession, that, may, take, centuries, or, millennia, to, complete, 720, how, much, energy, is, used, in, recycling, also, depends, on, the, type, of, material, being, recycled, and, the, process, used, to, do, so, aluminium, is, generally, agreed, to, use, far, less, energy, when, recycled, rather, than, being, produced, from, scratch, the, epa, states, that, recycling, aluminum, cans, for, example, saves, 95, percent, of, the, energy, required, to, make, the, same, amount, of, aluminum, from, its, virgin, source, bauxite, in, 2009, more, than, half, of, all, aluminium, cans, produced, came, from, recycled, aluminium, similarly, it, has, been, estimated, that, new, steel, produced, with, recycled, cans, reduces, greenhouse, gas, emissions, by, 75, every, year, millions, of, tons, of, materials, are, being, exploited, from, the, earth, s, crust, and, processed, into, consumer, and, capital, goods, after, decades, to, centuries, most, of, these, materials, are, lost, with, the, exception, of, some, pieces, of, art, or, religious, relics, they, are, no, longer, engaged, in, the, consumption, process, where, are, they, recycling, is, only, an, intermediate, solution, for, such, materials, although, it, does, prolong, the, residence, time, in, the, anthroposphere, for, thermodynamic, reasons, however, recycling, cannot, prevent, the, final, need, for, an, ultimate, sink, 1, economist, steven, landsburg, has, suggested, that, the, sole, benefit, of, reducing, landfill, space, is, trumped, by, the, energy, needed, and, resulting, pollution, from, the, recycling, process, others, however, have, calculated, through, life, cycle, assessment, that, producing, recycled, paper, uses, less, energy, and, water, than, harvesting, pulping, processing, and, transporting, virgin, trees, when, less, recycled, paper, is, used, additional, energy, is, needed, to, create, and, maintain, farmed, forests, until, these, forests, are, as, self, sustainable, as, virgin, forests, other, studies, have, shown, that, recycling, in, itself, is, inefficient, to, perform, the, decoupling, of, economic, development, from, the, depletion, of, non, renewable, raw, materials, that, is, necessary, for, sustainable, development, the, international, transportation, or, recycle, material, flows, through, different, trade, networks, of, the, three, countries, result, in, different, flows, decay, rates, and, potential, recycling, returns, 1, as, global, consumption, of, a, natural, resources, grows, their, depletion, is, inevitable, the, best, recycling, can, do, is, to, delay, complete, closure, of, material, loops, to, achieve, 100, percent, recycling, of, nonrenewables, is, impossible, as, micro, trace, materials, dissipate, into, the, environment, causing, severe, damage, to, the, planet, s, ecosystems, historically, this, was, identified, as, the, metabolic, rift, by, karl, marx, who, identified, the, unequal, exchange, rate, between, energy, and, nutrients, flowing, from, rural, areas, to, feed, urban, cities, that, create, effluent, wastes, degrading, the, planet, s, ecological, capital, such, as, loss, in, soil, nutrient, production, energy, conservation, also, leads, to, what, is, known, as, jevon, s, paradox, where, improvements, in, energy, efficiency, lowers, the, cost, of, production, and, leads, to, a, rebound, effect, where, rates, of, consumption, and, economic, growth, increases, the, amount, of, money, actually, saved, through, recycling, depends, on, the, efficiency, of, the, recycling, program, used, to, do, it, the, institute, for, local, self, reliance, argues, that, the, cost, of, recycling, depends, on, various, factors, such, as, landfill, fees, and, the, amount, of, disposal, that, the, community, recycles, it, states, that, communities, begin, to, save, money, when, they, treat, recycling, as, a, replacement, for, their, traditional, waste, system, rather, than, an, add, on, to, it, and, by, redesigning, their, collection, schedules, and, or, trucks, in, some, cases, the, cost, of, recyclable, materials, also, exceeds, the, cost, of, raw, materials, virgin, plastic, resin, costs, 40, percent, less, than, recycled, resin, additionally, a, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, study, that, tracked, the, price, of, clear, glass, from, 15, july, to, 2, august, 1991, found, that, the, average, cost, per, ton, ranged, from, 40, to, 60, while, a, usgs, report, shows, that, the, cost, per, ton, of, raw, silica, sand, from, years, 1993, to, 1997, fell, between, 17, 33, and, 18, 10, comparing, the, market, cost, of, recyclable, material, with, the, cost, of, new, raw, materials, ignores, economic, externalities, the, costs, that, are, currently, not, counted, by, the, market, creating, a, new, piece, of, plastic, for, instance, may, cause, more, pollution, and, be, less, sustainable, than, recycling, a, similar, piece, of, plastic, but, these, factors, are, not, counted, in, market, cost, a, life, cycle, assessment, can, be, used, to, determine, the, levels, of, externalities, and, decide, whether, the, recycling, may, be, worthwhile, despite, unfavorable, market, costs, alternatively, legal, means, such, as, a, carbon, tax, can, be, used, to, bring, externalities, into, the, market, so, that, the, market, cost, of, the, material, becomes, close, to, the, true, cost, the, recycling, of, waste, electrical, and, electronic, equipment, can, create, a, significant, amount, of, pollution, this, problem, is, specifically, occurrent, in, india, and, china, informal, recycling, in, an, underground, economy, of, these, countries, has, generated, an, environmental, and, health, disaster, high, levels, of, lead, pb, polybrominated, diphenylethers, pbdes, polychlorinated, dioxins, and, furans, as, well, as, polybrominated, dioxins, and, furans, pcdd, fs, and, pbdd, fs, concentrated, in, the, air, bottom, ash, dust, soil, water, and, sediments, in, areas, surrounding, recycling, sites, these, materials, can, make, work, sites, harmful, to, the, workers, themselves, and, the, surrounding, environment, in, some, countries, recycling, is, performed, by, the, entrepreneurial, poor, such, as, the, karung, guni, zabbaleen, the, rag, and, bone, man, waste, picker, and, junk, man, with, the, creation, of, large, recycling, organizations, that, may, be, profitable, either, by, law, or, economies, of, scale, the, poor, are, more, likely, to, be, driven, out, of, the, recycling, and, the, remanufacturing, job, market, to, compensate, for, this, loss, of, income, a, society, may, need, to, create, additional, forms, of, societal, programs, to, help, support, the, poor, like, the, parable, of, the, broken, window, there, is, a, net, loss, to, the, poor, and, possibly, the, whole, of, a, society, to, make, recycling, artificially, profitable, e, g, through, the, law, however, in, brazil, and, argentina, waste, pickers, informal, recyclers, work, alongside, the, authorities, in, fully, or, semi, funded, cooperatives, allowing, informal, recycling, to, be, legitimized, as, a, paid, public, sector, job, because, the, social, support, of, a, country, is, likely, to, be, less, than, the, loss, of, income, to, the, poor, undertaking, recycling, there, is, a, greater, chance, for, the, poor, to, come, in, conflict, with, the, large, recycling, organizations, this, means, fewer, people, can, decide, if, certain, waste, is, more, economically, reusable, in, its, current, form, rather, than, being, reprocessed, contrasted, to, the, recycling, poor, the, efficiency, of, their, recycling, may, actually, be, higher, for, some, materials, because, individuals, have, greater, control, over, what, is, considered, waste, one, labor, intensive, underused, waste, is, electronic, and, computer, waste, because, this, waste, may, still, be, functional, and, wanted, mostly, by, those, on, lower, incomes, who, may, sell, or, use, it, at, a, greater, efficiency, than, large, recyclers, some, recycling, advocates, believe, that, laissez, faire, individual, based, recycling, does, not, cover, all, of, society, s, recycling, needs, thus, it, does, not, negate, the, need, for, an, organized, recycling, program, local, government, can, consider, the, activities, of, the, recycling, poor, as, contributing, to, the, ruining, of, property, changes, that, have, been, demonstrated, to, increase, recycling, rates, include, in, a, study, done, by, social, psychologist, shawn, burn, it, was, found, that, personal, contact, with, individuals, within, a, neighborhood, is, the, most, effective, way, to, increase, recycling, within, a, community, in, her, study, she, had, 10, block, leaders, talk, to, their, neighbors, and, persuade, them, to, recycle, a, comparison, group, was, sent, fliers, promoting, recycling, it, was, found, that, the, neighbors, that, were, personally, contacted, by, their, block, leaders, recycled, much, more, than, the, group, without, personal, contact, as, a, result, of, this, study, shawn, burn, believes, that, personal, contact, within, a, small, group, of, people, is, an, important, factor, in, encouraging, recycling, another, study, done, by, stuart, oskamp, examines, the, effect, of, neighbors, and, friends, on, recycling, it, was, found, in, his, studies, that, people, who, had, friends, and, neighbors, that, recycled, were, much, more, likely, to, also, recycle, than, those, who, did, not, have, friends, and, neighbors, that, recycled, many, schools, have, created, recycling, awareness, clubs, in, order, to, give, young, students, an, insight, on, recycling, these, schools, believe, that, the, clubs, actually, encourage, students, to, not, only, recycle, at, school, but, at, home, as, well, recycling, of, metals, varies, extremely, by, type, titanium, and, lead, have, an, extremely, high, recycling, rates, of, over, 90, copper, and, cobalt, have, high, rates, of, recycling, around, 75, only, about, half, of, aluminum, is, recycled, most, of, the, remaining, metals, have, recycling, rates, of, below, 35, while, 34, types, of, metals, have, recycling, rates, of, under, 1, between, 1960, and, 2000, the, world, production, of, plastic, resins, increased, 25, times, its, original, amount, while, recovery, of, the, material, remained, below, 5, percent, 131, many, studies, have, addressed, recycling, behaviour, and, strategies, to, encourage, community, involvement, in, recycling, programs, it, has, been, argued, that, recycling, behavior, is, not, natural, because, it, requires, a, focus, and, appreciation, for, long, term, planning, whereas, humans, have, evolved, to, be, sensitive, to, short, term, survival, goals, and, that, to, overcome, this, innate, predisposition, the, best, solution, would, be, to, use, social, pressure, to, compel, participation, in, recycling, programs, however, recent, studies, have, concluded, that, social, pressure, does, not, work, in, this, context, one, reason, for, this, is, that, social, pressure, functions, well, in, small, group, sizes, of, 50, to, 150, individuals, common, to, nomadic, hunter, gatherer, peoples, but, not, in, communities, numbering, in, the, millions, as, we, see, today, another, reason, is, that, individual, recycling, does, not, take, place, in, the, public, view, following, the, increasing, popularity, of, recycling, collection, being, sent, to, the, same, landfills, as, trash, some, people, kept, on, putting, recyclables, on, the, recyclables, bin, art, objects, are, more, and, more, often, made, from, recycled, material, by, extending, the, lifespan, of, goods, parts, and, materials, a, circular, economy, seeks, to, minimize, waste, and, maximize, resource, utilization, advanced, sorting, techniques, like, optical, and, robotic, sorting, may, separate, and, recover, valuable, materials, from, waste, streams, lowering, the, requirement, for, virgin, resources, and, accelerating, the, shift, to, a, circular, economy, community, engagement, such, as, education, and, awareness, campaigns, may, support, the, acceptance, of, recycling, and, reuse, programs, and, encourage, the, usage, of, sustainable, practices, one, can, lessen, our, influence, on, the, environment, save, natural, resources, and, generate, economic, possibilities, by, adopting, a, circular, economy, using, cutting, edge, sorting, technology, and, community, engagement, according, to, melati, et, al, to, successfully, transition, to, a, circular, economy, legislative, and, regulatory, frameworks, must, encourage, sustainable, practices, while, addressing, possible, obstacles, and, difficulties, in, putting, these, ideas, into, action
