subsistence, agriculture, occurs, when, farmers, grow, crops, on, smallholdings, to, meet, the, needs, of, themselves, and, their, families, subsistence, agriculturalists, target, farm, output, for, survival, and, for, mostly, local, requirements, planting, decisions, occur, principally, with, an, eye, toward, what, the, family, will, need, during, the, coming, year, and, only, secondarily, toward, market, prices, tony, waters, a, professor, of, sociology, defines, subsistence, peasants, as, people, who, grow, what, they, eat, build, their, own, houses, and, live, without, regularly, making, purchases, in, the, marketplace, 2, despite, the, self, sufficiency, in, subsistence, farming, most, subsistence, farmers, also, participate, in, trade, to, some, degree, although, their, amount, of, trade, as, measured, in, cash, is, less, than, that, of, consumers, in, countries, with, modern, complex, markets, they, use, these, markets, mainly, to, obtain, goods, not, to, generate, income, for, food, these, goods, are, typically, not, necessary, for, survival, and, may, include, sugar, iron, roofing, sheets, bicycles, used, clothing, and, so, forth, many, have, important, trade, contacts, and, trade, items, that, they, can, produce, because, of, their, special, skills, or, special, access, to, resources, valued, in, the, marketplace, subsistence, farming, today, is, most, common, in, developing, countries, subsistence, agriculture, generally, features, small, capital, finance, requirements, mixed, cropping, limited, use, of, agrochemicals, e, g, pesticides, and, fertilizer, unimproved, varieties, of, crops, and, animals, little, or, no, surplus, yield, for, sale, use, of, crude, traditional, tools, e, g, hoes, machetes, and, cutlasses, mainly, the, production, of, crops, small, scattered, plots, of, land, reliance, on, unskilled, labor, often, family, members, and, generally, low, yields, subsistence, agriculture, was, the, dominant, mode, of, production, in, the, world, until, recently, when, market, based, capitalism, became, widespread, subsistence, agriculture, largely, disappeared, in, europe, by, the, beginning, of, the, twentieth, century, it, began, to, decrease, in, north, america, with, the, movement, of, sharecroppers, and, tenant, farmers, out, of, the, american, south, and, midwest, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, in, central, and, eastern, europe, semi, subsistence, agriculture, reappeared, within, the, transition, economy, after, 1990, but, declined, in, significance, or, disappeared, in, most, countries, by, the, accession, to, the, eu, in, 2004, or, 2007, subsistence, farming, continues, today, in, large, parts, of, rural, africa, and, parts, of, asia, and, latin, america, in, 2015, about, 2, billion, people, slightly, more, than, 25, of, the, world, s, population, in, 500, million, households, living, in, rural, areas, of, developing, nations, survive, as, smallholder, farmers, working, less, than, 2, hectares, 5, acres, of, land, around, 98, of, china, s, farmers, work, on, small, farms, and, china, accounts, for, around, half, of, the, total, world, farms, in, india, 80, of, the, total, farmers, are, smallholder, farmers, ethiopia, and, asia, have, almost, 90, being, small, while, mexico, and, brazil, recorded, 50, and, 20, being, small, areas, where, subsistence, farming, is, largely, practiced, today, such, as, india, and, other, regions, in, asia, have, seen, a, recent, decline, in, the, practice, this, is, due, to, processes, such, as, urbanization, the, transformation, of, land, into, rural, areas, and, integration, of, capitalist, forms, of, farming, in, india, the, increase, in, industrialization, and, decrease, in, rural, agriculture, has, led, to, rural, unemployment, and, increased, poverty, for, those, in, lower, caste, groups, those, that, are, able, to, live, and, work, in, urbanized, areas, are, able, to, increase, their, income, while, those, that, remain, in, rural, areas, take, large, decreases, which, is, why, there, was, no, large, decline, in, poverty, this, effectively, widens, the, income, gap, between, lower, and, higher, castes, and, makes, it, harder, for, those, in, rural, areas, to, move, up, in, caste, ranking, this, era, has, marked, a, time, of, increased, farmer, suicides, and, the, vanishing, village, most, subsistence, agriculture, is, practiced, in, developing, countries, located, in, tropical, climates, effects, on, crop, production, brought, about, by, climate, change, will, be, more, intense, in, these, regions, as, extreme, temperatures, are, linked, to, lower, crop, yields, farmers, have, been, forced, to, respond, to, increased, temperatures, through, things, such, as, increased, land, and, labor, inputs, which, threaten, long, term, productivity, coping, measures, in, response, to, variable, climates, can, include, reducing, daily, food, consumption, and, selling, livestock, to, compensate, for, the, decreased, productivity, these, responses, often, threaten, the, future, of, household, farms, in, the, following, seasons, as, many, farmers, will, sell, draft, animals, used, for, labor, and, will, also, consume, seeds, saved, for, planting, measuring, the, full, extent, of, future, climate, change, impacts, is, difficult, to, determine, as, smallholder, farms, are, complex, systems, with, many, different, interactions, different, locations, have, different, adaptation, strategies, available, to, them, such, as, crop, and, livestock, substitutions, rates, of, production, for, cereal, crops, such, as, wheat, oats, and, maize, have, been, declining, largely, due, to, heat, s, effects, on, crop, fertility, this, has, forced, many, farmers, to, switch, to, more, heat, tolerant, crops, to, maintain, levels, of, productivity, substitution, of, crops, for, heat, tolerant, alternatives, limits, the, overall, diversity, of, crops, grown, on, smallholder, farms, as, many, farmers, farm, to, meet, daily, food, needs, this, can, negatively, impact, nutrition, and, diet, among, many, families, practicing, subsistence, agriculture, in, this, type, of, farming, a, patch, of, forest, land, is, cleared, by, a, combination, of, felling, chopping, down, and, burning, and, crops, are, grown, after, two, three, years, the, fertility, of, the, soil, begins, to, decline, the, land, is, abandoned, and, the, farmer, moves, to, clear, a, fresh, piece, of, land, elsewhere, in, the, forest, as, the, process, continues, while, the, land, is, left, fallow, the, forest, regrows, in, the, cleared, area, and, soil, fertility, and, biomass, is, restored, after, a, decade, or, more, the, farmer, may, return, to, the, first, piece, of, land, this, form, of, agriculture, is, sustainable, at, low, population, densities, but, higher, population, loads, require, more, frequent, clearing, which, prevents, soil, fertility, from, recovering, opens, up, more, of, the, forest, canopy, and, encourages, scrub, at, the, expense, of, large, trees, eventually, resulting, in, deforestation, and, soil, erosion, shifting, cultivation, is, called, dredd, in, india, ladang, in, indonesia, and, jhumming, in, north, east, india, while, shifting, agriculture, s, slash, and, burn, technique, may, describe, the, method, for, opening, new, land, commonly, the, farmers, in, question, have, in, existence, at, the, same, time, smaller, fields, sometimes, merely, gardens, near, the, homestead, there, they, practice, intensive, non, shifting, techniques, these, farmers, pair, this, with, slash, and, burn, techniques, to, clear, additional, land, and, by, the, burning, provide, fertilizer, ash, such, gardens, near, the, homestead, often, regularly, receive, household, refuse, the, manure, of, any, household, chickens, or, goats, are, initially, thrown, into, compost, piles, just, to, get, them, out, of, the, way, however, such, farmers, often, recognize, the, value, of, such, compost, and, apply, it, regularly, to, their, smaller, fields, they, also, may, irrigate, part, of, such, fields, if, they, are, near, a, source, of, water, in, some, areas, of, tropical, africa, at, least, such, smaller, fields, may, be, ones, in, which, crops, are, grown, on, raised, beds, thus, farmers, practicing, slash, and, burn, agriculture, are, often, much, more, sophisticated, agriculturalists, than, the, term, slash, and, burn, subsistence, farmers, suggests, in, this, type, of, farming, people, migrate, along, with, their, animals, from, one, place, to, another, in, search, of, fodder, for, their, animals, generally, they, rear, cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and, or, yaks, for, milk, skin, meat, and, wool, this, way, of, life, is, common, in, parts, of, central, and, western, asia, india, east, and, southwest, africa, and, northern, eurasia, examples, are, the, nomadic, bhotiyas, and, gujjars, of, the, himalayas, they, carry, their, belongings, such, as, tents, etc, on, the, backs, of, donkeys, horses, and, camels, in, mountainous, regions, like, tibet, and, the, andes, yak, and, llama, are, reared, reindeer, are, the, livestock, in, arctic, and, sub, arctic, areas, sheep, goats, and, camels, are, common, animals, and, cattle, and, horses, are, also, important, in, intensive, subsistence, agriculture, the, farmer, cultivates, a, small, plot, of, land, using, simple, tools, and, more, labour, climate, with, large, number, of, days, with, sunshine, and, fertile, soils, permits, growing, of, more, than, one, crop, annually, on, the, same, plot, farmers, use, their, small, land, holdings, to, produce, enough, for, their, local, consumption, while, remaining, produce, is, used, for, exchange, against, other, goods, it, results, in, much, more, food, being, produced, per, acre, compared, to, other, subsistence, patterns, in, the, most, intensive, situation, farmers, may, even, create, terraces, along, steep, hillsides, to, cultivate, rice, paddies, such, fields, are, found, in, densely, populated, parts, of, asia, such, as, in, the, philippines, they, may, also, intensify, by, using, manure, artificial, irrigation, and, animal, waste, as, fertilizer, intensive, subsistence, farming, is, prevalent, in, the, thickly, populated, areas, of, the, monsoon, regions, of, south, southwest, and, southeast, asia, subsistence, agriculture, can, be, used, as, a, poverty, alleviation, strategy, specifically, as, a, safety, net, for, food, price, shocks, and, for, food, security, poor, countries, are, limited, in, fiscal, and, institutional, resources, that, would, allow, them, to, contain, rises, in, domestic, prices, as, well, as, to, manage, social, assistance, programs, which, is, often, because, they, are, using, policy, tools, that, are, intended, for, middle, and, high, income, countries, low, income, countries, tend, to, have, populations, in, which, 80, of, poor, are, in, rural, areas, and, more, than, 90, of, rural, households, have, access, to, land, yet, a, majority, of, these, rural, poor, have, insufficient, access, to, food, subsistence, agriculture, can, be, used, in, low, income, countries, as, a, part, of, policy, responses, to, a, food, crisis, in, the, short, and, medium, term, and, provide, a, safety, net, for, the, poor, in, these, countries, agriculture, is, more, successful, over, non, agricultural, jobs, in, combating, poverty, in, countries, that, have, a, larger, population, of, people, without, education, or, that, are, unskilled, however, there, are, levels, of, poverty, to, be, aware, of, to, target, agriculture, towards, the, right, audience, agriculture, is, better, at, reducing, poverty, in, those, that, have, an, income, of, 1, per, day, than, those, that, have, an, income, of, 2, per, day, in, africa, people, who, make, less, income, are, more, likely, to, be, poorly, educated, and, have, fewer, opportunities, therefore, they, work, more, labor, intensive, jobs, such, as, agriculture, people, who, make, 2, have, more, opportunities, to, work, in, less, labor, intensive, jobs, in, non, agricultural, fields
