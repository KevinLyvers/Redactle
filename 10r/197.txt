solar, energy, is, radiant, light, and, heat, from, the, sun, that, is, harnessed, using, a, range, of, technologies, such, as, solar, power, to, generate, electricity, solar, thermal, energy, including, solar, water, heating, and, solar, architecture, it, is, an, essential, source, of, renewable, energy, and, its, technologies, are, broadly, characterized, as, either, passive, solar, or, active, solar, depending, on, how, they, capture, and, distribute, solar, energy, or, convert, it, into, solar, power, active, solar, techniques, include, the, use, of, photovoltaic, systems, concentrated, solar, power, and, solar, water, heating, to, harness, the, energy, passive, solar, techniques, include, orienting, a, building, to, the, sun, selecting, materials, with, favorable, thermal, mass, or, light, dispersing, properties, and, designing, spaces, that, naturally, circulate, air, in, 2011, the, international, energy, agency, said, that, the, development, of, affordable, inexhaustible, and, clean, solar, energy, technologies, will, have, huge, longer, term, benefits, it, will, increase, countries, energy, security, through, reliance, on, an, indigenous, inexhaustible, and, mostly, import, independent, resource, enhance, sustainability, reduce, pollution, lower, the, costs, of, mitigating, global, warming, these, advantages, are, global, the, earth, receives, 174, petawatts, pw, of, incoming, solar, radiation, insolation, at, the, upper, atmosphere, approximately, 30, is, reflected, back, to, space, while, the, rest, 122, pw, is, absorbed, by, clouds, oceans, and, land, masses, the, spectrum, of, solar, light, at, the, earth, s, surface, is, mostly, spread, across, the, visible, and, near, infrared, ranges, with, a, small, part, in, the, near, ultraviolet, most, of, the, world, s, population, live, in, areas, with, insolation, levels, of, 150, 300, watts, m, 2, or, 3, 5, 7, 0, kwh, m, 2, per, day, solar, radiation, is, absorbed, by, the, earth, s, land, surface, oceans, which, cover, about, 71, of, the, globe, and, atmosphere, warm, air, containing, evaporated, water, from, the, oceans, rises, causing, atmospheric, circulation, or, convection, when, the, air, reaches, a, high, altitude, where, the, temperature, is, low, water, vapor, condenses, into, clouds, which, rain, onto, the, earth, s, surface, completing, the, water, cycle, the, latent, heat, of, water, condensation, amplifies, convection, producing, atmospheric, phenomena, such, as, wind, cyclones, and, anticyclones, sunlight, absorbed, by, the, oceans, and, land, masses, keeps, the, surface, at, an, average, temperature, of, 14, c, by, photosynthesis, green, plants, convert, solar, energy, into, chemically, stored, energy, which, produces, food, wood, and, the, biomass, from, which, fossil, fuels, are, derived, the, total, solar, energy, absorbed, by, earth, s, atmosphere, oceans, and, land, masses, is, approximately, 122, pw, year, 3, 850, 000, exajoules, ej, per, year, in, 2002, 2019, this, was, more, energy, in, one, hour, one, hour, and, 25, minutes, than, the, world, used, in, one, year, photosynthesis, captures, approximately, 3, 000, ej, per, year, in, biomass, the, potential, solar, energy, that, could, be, used, by, humans, differs, from, the, amount, of, solar, energy, present, near, the, surface, of, the, planet, because, factors, such, as, geography, time, variation, cloud, cover, and, the, land, available, to, humans, limit, the, amount, of, solar, energy, that, we, can, acquire, in, 2021, carbon, tracker, initiative, estimated, the, land, area, needed, to, generate, all, our, energy, from, solar, alone, was, 450, 000, km, 2, or, about, the, same, as, the, area, of, sweden, or, the, area, of, morocco, or, the, area, of, california, 0, 3, of, the, earth, s, total, land, area, solar, technologies, are, categorized, as, either, passive, or, active, depending, on, the, way, they, capture, convert, and, distribute, sunlight, and, enable, solar, energy, to, be, harnessed, at, different, levels, around, the, world, mostly, depending, on, the, distance, from, the, equator, although, solar, energy, refers, primarily, to, the, use, of, solar, radiation, for, practical, ends, all, types, of, renewable, energy, other, than, geothermal, power, and, tidal, power, are, derived, either, directly, or, indirectly, from, the, sun, active, solar, techniques, use, photovoltaics, concentrated, solar, power, solar, thermal, collectors, pumps, and, fans, to, convert, sunlight, into, useful, output, passive, solar, techniques, include, selecting, materials, with, favorable, thermal, properties, designing, spaces, that, naturally, circulate, air, and, referencing, the, position, of, a, building, to, the, sun, active, solar, technologies, increase, the, supply, of, energy, and, are, considered, supply, side, technologies, while, passive, solar, technologies, reduce, the, need, for, alternative, resources, and, are, generally, considered, demand, side, technologies, in, 2000, the, united, nations, development, programme, un, department, of, economic, and, social, affairs, and, world, energy, council, published, an, estimate, of, the, potential, solar, energy, that, could, be, used, by, humans, each, year, this, took, into, account, factors, such, as, insolation, cloud, cover, and, the, land, that, is, usable, by, humans, it, was, stated, that, solar, energy, has, a, global, potential, of, 1, 600, to, 49, 800, exajoules, 4, 4, 10, 14, to, 1, 4, 10, 16, kwh, per, year, see, table, below, quantitative, relation, of, global, solar, potential, vs, the, world, s, primary, energy, consumption, source, united, nations, development, programme, world, energy, assessment, 2000, solar, thermal, technologies, can, be, used, for, water, heating, space, heating, space, cooling, and, process, heat, generation, in, 1878, at, the, universal, exposition, in, paris, augustin, mouchot, successfully, demonstrated, a, solar, steam, engine, but, could, not, continue, development, because, of, cheap, coal, and, other, factors, in, 1897, frank, shuman, a, us, inventor, engineer, and, solar, energy, pioneer, built, a, small, demonstration, solar, engine, that, worked, by, reflecting, solar, energy, onto, square, boxes, filled, with, ether, which, has, a, lower, boiling, point, than, water, and, were, fitted, internally, with, black, pipes, which, in, turn, powered, a, steam, engine, in, 1908, shuman, formed, the, sun, power, company, with, the, intent, of, building, larger, solar, power, plants, he, along, with, his, technical, advisor, a, s, e, ackermann, and, british, physicist, sir, charles, vernon, boys, developed, an, improved, system, using, mirrors, to, reflect, solar, energy, upon, collector, boxes, increasing, heating, capacity, to, the, extent, that, water, could, now, be, used, instead, of, ether, shuman, then, constructed, a, full, scale, steam, engine, powered, by, low, pressure, water, enabling, him, to, patent, the, entire, solar, engine, system, by, 1912, shuman, built, the, world, s, first, solar, thermal, power, station, in, maadi, egypt, between, 1912, and, 1913, his, plant, used, parabolic, troughs, to, power, a, 45, 52, kilowatts, 60, 70, hp, engine, that, pumped, more, than, 22, 000, litres, 4, 800, imp, gal, 5, 800, us, gal, of, water, per, minute, from, the, nile, river, to, adjacent, cotton, fields, although, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, and, the, discovery, of, cheap, oil, in, the, 1930s, discouraged, the, advancement, of, solar, energy, shuman, s, vision, and, basic, design, were, resurrected, in, the, 1970s, with, a, new, wave, of, interest, in, solar, thermal, energy, in, 1916, shuman, was, quoted, in, the, media, advocating, solar, energy, s, utilization, saying, we, have, proved, the, commercial, profit, of, sun, power, in, the, tropics, and, have, more, particularly, proved, that, after, our, stores, of, oil, and, coal, are, exhausted, the, human, race, can, receive, unlimited, power, from, the, rays, of, the, sun, solar, hot, water, systems, use, sunlight, to, heat, water, in, middle, geographical, latitudes, between, 40, degrees, north, and, 40, degrees, south, 60, to, 70, of, the, domestic, hot, water, use, with, water, temperatures, up, to, 60, c, 140, f, can, be, provided, by, solar, heating, systems, the, most, common, types, of, solar, water, heaters, are, evacuated, tube, collectors, 44, and, glazed, flat, plate, collectors, 34, generally, used, for, domestic, hot, water, and, unglazed, plastic, collectors, 21, used, mainly, to, heat, swimming, pools, as, of, 2015, the, total, installed, capacity, of, solar, hot, water, systems, was, approximately, 436, thermal, gigawatt, gw, th, and, china, is, the, world, leader, in, their, deployment, with, 309, gw, th, installed, taken, up, 71, of, the, market, israel, and, cyprus, are, the, per, capita, leaders, in, the, use, of, solar, hot, water, systems, with, over, 90, of, homes, using, them, in, the, united, states, canada, and, australia, heating, swimming, pools, is, the, dominant, application, of, solar, hot, water, with, an, installed, capacity, of, 18, gw, th, as, of, 2005, in, the, united, states, heating, ventilation, and, air, conditioning, hvac, systems, account, for, 30, 4, 65, ej, yr, of, the, energy, used, in, commercial, buildings, and, nearly, 50, 10, 1, ej, yr, of, the, energy, used, in, residential, buildings, solar, heating, cooling, and, ventilation, technologies, can, be, used, to, offset, a, portion, of, this, energy, use, of, solar, for, heating, can, roughly, be, divided, into, passive, solar, concepts, and, active, solar, concepts, depending, on, whether, active, elements, such, as, sun, tracking, and, solar, concentrator, optics, are, used, thermal, mass, is, any, material, that, can, be, used, to, store, heat, heat, from, the, sun, in, the, case, of, solar, energy, common, thermal, mass, materials, include, stone, cement, and, water, historically, they, have, been, used, in, arid, climates, or, warm, temperate, regions, to, keep, buildings, cool, by, absorbing, solar, energy, during, the, day, and, radiating, stored, heat, to, the, cooler, atmosphere, at, night, however, they, can, be, used, in, cold, temperate, areas, to, maintain, warmth, as, well, the, size, and, placement, of, thermal, mass, depend, on, several, factors, such, as, climate, daylighting, and, shading, conditions, when, duly, incorporated, thermal, mass, maintains, space, temperatures, in, a, comfortable, range, and, reduces, the, need, for, auxiliary, heating, and, cooling, equipment, a, solar, chimney, or, thermal, chimney, in, this, context, is, a, passive, solar, ventilation, system, composed, of, a, vertical, shaft, connecting, the, interior, and, exterior, of, a, building, as, the, chimney, warms, the, air, inside, is, heated, causing, an, updraft, that, pulls, air, through, the, building, performance, can, be, improved, by, using, glazing, and, thermal, mass, materials, in, a, way, that, mimics, greenhouses, deciduous, trees, and, plants, have, been, promoted, as, a, means, of, controlling, solar, heating, and, cooling, when, planted, on, the, southern, side, of, a, building, in, the, northern, hemisphere, or, the, northern, side, in, the, southern, hemisphere, their, leaves, provide, shade, during, the, summer, while, the, bare, limbs, allow, light, to, pass, during, the, winter, since, bare, leafless, trees, shade, 1, 3, to, 1, 2, of, incident, solar, radiation, there, is, a, balance, between, the, benefits, of, summer, shading, and, the, corresponding, loss, of, winter, heating, in, climates, with, significant, heating, loads, deciduous, trees, should, not, be, planted, on, the, equator, facing, side, of, a, building, because, they, will, interfere, with, winter, solar, availability, they, can, however, be, used, on, the, east, and, west, sides, to, provide, a, degree, of, summer, shading, without, appreciably, affecting, winter, solar, gain, solar, cookers, use, sunlight, for, cooking, drying, and, pasteurization, they, can, be, grouped, into, three, broad, categories, box, cookers, panel, cookers, and, reflector, cookers, the, simplest, solar, cooker, is, the, box, cooker, first, built, by, horace, de, saussure, in, 1767, a, basic, box, cooker, consists, of, an, insulated, container, with, a, transparent, lid, it, can, be, used, effectively, with, partially, overcast, skies, and, will, typically, reach, temperatures, of, 90, 150, c, 194, 302, f, panel, cookers, use, a, reflective, panel, to, direct, sunlight, onto, an, insulated, container, and, reach, temperatures, comparable, to, box, cookers, reflector, cookers, use, various, concentrating, geometries, dish, trough, fresnel, mirrors, to, focus, light, on, a, cooking, container, these, cookers, reach, temperatures, of, 315, c, 599, f, and, above, but, require, direct, light, to, function, properly, and, must, be, repositioned, to, track, the, sun, solar, concentrating, technologies, such, as, parabolic, dish, trough, and, scheffler, reflectors, can, provide, process, heat, for, commercial, and, industrial, applications, the, first, commercial, system, was, the, solar, total, energy, project, step, in, shenandoah, georgia, us, where, a, field, of, 114, parabolic, dishes, provided, 50, of, the, process, heating, air, conditioning, and, electrical, requirements, for, a, clothing, factory, this, grid, connected, cogeneration, system, provided, 400, kw, of, electricity, plus, thermal, energy, in, the, form, of, 401, kw, steam, and, 468, kw, chilled, water, and, had, a, one, hour, peak, load, thermal, storage, evaporation, ponds, are, shallow, pools, that, concentrate, dissolved, solids, through, evaporation, the, use, of, evaporation, ponds, to, obtain, salt, from, seawater, is, one, of, the, oldest, applications, of, solar, energy, modern, uses, include, concentrating, brine, solutions, used, in, leach, mining, and, removing, dissolved, solids, from, waste, streams, clothes, lines, clotheshorses, and, clothes, racks, dry, clothes, through, evaporation, by, wind, and, sunlight, without, consuming, electricity, or, gas, in, some, states, of, the, united, states, legislation, protects, the, right, to, dry, clothes, unglazed, transpired, collectors, utc, are, perforated, sun, facing, walls, used, for, preheating, ventilation, air, utcs, can, raise, the, incoming, air, temperature, up, to, 22, c, 40, f, and, deliver, outlet, temperatures, of, 45, 60, c, 113, 140, f, the, short, payback, period, of, transpired, collectors, 3, to, 12, years, makes, them, a, more, cost, effective, alternative, than, glazed, collection, systems, as, of, 2003, over, 80, systems, with, a, combined, collector, area, of, 35, 000, square, metres, 380, 000, sq, ft, had, been, installed, worldwide, including, an, 860, m, 2, 9, 300, sq, ft, collector, in, costa, rica, used, for, drying, coffee, beans, and, a, 1, 300, m, 2, 14, 000, sq, ft, collector, in, coimbatore, india, used, for, drying, marigolds, solar, distillation, can, be, used, to, make, saline, or, brackish, water, potable, the, first, recorded, instance, of, this, was, by, 16th, century, arab, alchemists, a, large, scale, solar, distillation, project, was, first, constructed, in, 1872, in, the, chilean, mining, town, of, las, salinas, the, plant, which, had, solar, collection, area, of, 4, 700, m, 2, 51, 000, sq, ft, could, produce, up, to, 22, 700, l, 5, 000, imp, gal, 6, 000, us, gal, per, day, and, operate, for, 40, years, individual, still, designs, include, single, slope, double, slope, or, greenhouse, type, vertical, conical, inverted, absorber, multi, wick, and, multiple, effect, these, stills, can, operate, in, passive, active, or, hybrid, modes, double, slope, stills, are, the, most, economical, for, decentralized, domestic, purposes, while, active, multiple, effect, units, are, more, suitable, for, large, scale, applications, solar, water, disinfection, sodis, involves, exposing, water, filled, plastic, polyethylene, terephthalate, pet, bottles, to, sunlight, for, several, hours, exposure, times, vary, depending, on, weather, and, climate, from, a, minimum, of, six, hours, to, two, days, during, fully, overcast, conditions, it, is, recommended, by, the, world, health, organization, as, a, viable, method, for, household, water, treatment, and, safe, storage, over, two, million, people, in, developing, countries, use, this, method, for, their, daily, drinking, water, solar, energy, may, be, used, in, a, water, stabilization, pond, to, treat, waste, water, without, chemicals, or, electricity, a, further, environmental, advantage, is, that, algae, grow, in, such, ponds, and, consume, carbon, dioxide, in, photosynthesis, although, algae, may, produce, toxic, chemicals, that, make, the, water, unusable, molten, salt, can, be, employed, as, a, thermal, energy, storage, method, to, retain, thermal, energy, collected, by, a, solar, tower, or, solar, trough, of, a, concentrated, solar, power, plant, so, that, it, can, be, used, to, generate, electricity, in, bad, weather, or, at, night, it, was, demonstrated, in, the, solar, two, project, from, 1995, to, 1999, the, system, is, predicted, to, have, an, annual, efficiency, of, 99, a, reference, to, the, energy, retained, by, storing, heat, before, turning, it, into, electricity, versus, converting, heat, directly, into, electricity, the, molten, salt, mixtures, vary, the, most, extended, mixture, contains, sodium, nitrate, potassium, nitrate, and, calcium, nitrate, it, is, non, flammable, and, non, toxic, and, has, already, been, used, in, the, chemical, and, metals, industries, as, a, heat, transport, fluid, hence, experience, with, such, systems, exists, in, non,

aircraft, to, remain, airborne, for, several, days, a, solar, balloon, is, a, black, balloon, that, is, filled, with, ordinary, air, as, sunlight, shines, on, the, balloon, the, air, inside, is, heated, and, expands, causing, an, upward, buoyancy, force, much, like, an, artificially, heated, hot, air, balloon, some, solar, balloons, are, large, enough, for, human, flight, but, usage, is, generally, limited, to, the, toy, market, as, the, surface, area, to, payload, weight, ratio, is, relatively, high, the, squad, solar, is, a, neighborhood, electric, vehicle, that, has, a, solar, roof, and, can, be, plugged, into, a, normal, 120, volt, outlet, to, be, charged, solar, chemical, processes, use, solar, energy, to, drive, chemical, reactions, these, processes, offset, energy, that, would, otherwise, come, from, a, fossil, fuel, source, and, can, also, convert, solar, energy, into, storable, and, transportable, fuels, solar, induced, chemical, reactions, can, be, divided, into, thermochemical, or, photochemical, a, variety, of, fuels, can, be, produced, by, artificial, photosynthesis, the, multielectron, catalytic, chemistry, involved, in, making, carbon, based, fuels, such, as, methanol, from, reduction, of, carbon, dioxide, is, challenging, a, feasible, alternative, is, hydrogen, production, from, protons, though, use, of, water, as, the, source, of, electrons, as, plants, do, requires, mastering, the, multielectron, oxidation, of, two, water, molecules, to, molecular, oxygen, some, have, envisaged, working, solar, fuel, plants, in, coastal, metropolitan, areas, by, 2050, the, splitting, of, seawater, providing, hydrogen, to, be, run, through, adjacent, fuel, cell, electric, power, plants, and, the, pure, water, by, product, going, directly, into, the, municipal, water, system, in, addition, chemical, energy, storage, is, another, solution, to, solar, energy, storage, hydrogen, production, technologies, have, been, a, significant, area, of, solar, chemical, research, since, the, 1970s, aside, from, electrolysis, driven, by, photovoltaic, or, photochemical, cells, several, thermochemical, processes, have, also, been, explored, one, such, route, uses, concentrators, to, split, water, into, oxygen, and, hydrogen, at, high, temperatures, 2, 300, 2, 600, c, or, 4, 200, 4, 700, f, another, approach, uses, the, heat, from, solar, concentrators, to, drive, the, steam, reformation, of, natural, gas, thereby, increasing, the, overall, hydrogen, yield, compared, to, conventional, reforming, methods, thermochemical, cycles, characterized, by, the, decomposition, and, regeneration, of, reactants, present, another, avenue, for, hydrogen, production, the, solzinc, process, under, development, at, the, weizmann, institute, of, science, uses, a, 1, mw, solar, furnace, to, decompose, zinc, oxide, zno, at, temperatures, above, 1, 200, c, 2, 200, f, this, initial, reaction, produces, pure, zinc, which, can, subsequently, be, reacted, with, water, to, produce, hydrogen, thermal, mass, systems, can, store, solar, energy, in, the, form, of, heat, at, domestically, useful, temperatures, for, daily, or, interseasonal, durations, thermal, storage, systems, generally, use, readily, available, materials, with, high, specific, heat, capacities, such, as, water, earth, and, stone, well, designed, systems, can, lower, peak, demand, shift, time, of, use, to, off, peak, hours, and, reduce, overall, heating, and, cooling, requirements, phase, change, materials, such, as, paraffin, wax, and, glauber, s, salt, are, another, thermal, storage, medium, these, materials, are, inexpensive, readily, available, and, can, deliver, domestically, useful, temperatures, approximately, 64, c, or, 147, f, the, dover, house, in, dover, massachusetts, was, the, first, to, use, a, glauber, s, salt, heating, system, in, 1948, solar, energy, can, also, be, stored, at, high, temperatures, using, molten, salts, salts, are, an, effective, storage, medium, because, they, are, low, cost, have, a, high, specific, heat, capacity, and, can, deliver, heat, at, temperatures, compatible, with, conventional, power, systems, the, solar, two, project, used, this, method, of, energy, storage, allowing, it, to, store, 1, 44, terajoules, 400, 000, kwh, in, its, 68, m, 3, storage, tank, with, an, annual, storage, efficiency, of, about, 99, off, grid, pv, systems, have, traditionally, used, rechargeable, batteries, to, store, excess, electricity, with, grid, tied, systems, excess, electricity, can, be, sent, to, the, transmission, grid, while, standard, grid, electricity, can, be, used, to, meet, shortfalls, net, metering, programs, give, household, systems, credit, for, any, electricity, they, deliver, to, the, grid, this, is, handled, by, rolling, back, the, meter, whenever, the, home, produces, more, electricity, than, it, consumes, if, the, net, electricity, use, is, below, zero, the, utility, then, rolls, over, the, kilowatt, hour, credit, to, the, next, month, other, approaches, involve, the, use, of, two, meters, to, measure, electricity, consumed, vs, electricity, produced, this, is, less, common, due, to, the, increased, installation, cost, of, the, second, meter, most, standard, meters, accurately, measure, in, both, directions, making, a, second, meter, unnecessary, pumped, storage, hydroelectricity, stores, energy, in, the, form, of, water, pumped, when, energy, is, available, from, a, lower, elevation, reservoir, to, a, higher, elevation, one, the, energy, is, recovered, when, demand, is, high, by, releasing, the, water, with, the, pump, becoming, a, hydroelectric, power, generator, beginning, with, the, surge, in, coal, use, which, accompanied, the, industrial, revolution, energy, consumption, steadily, transitioned, from, wood, and, biomass, to, fossil, fuels, the, early, development, of, solar, technologies, starting, in, the, 1860s, was, driven, by, an, expectation, that, coal, would, soon, become, scarce, however, development, of, solar, technologies, stagnated, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, face, of, the, increasing, availability, economy, and, utility, of, coal, and, petroleum, the, 1973, oil, embargo, and, 1979, energy, crisis, caused, a, reorganization, of, energy, policies, around, the, world, it, brought, renewed, attention, to, developing, solar, technologies, deployment, strategies, focused, on, incentive, programs, such, as, the, federal, photovoltaic, utilization, program, in, the, us, and, the, sunshine, program, in, japan, other, efforts, included, the, formation, of, research, facilities, in, the, us, seri, now, nrel, japan, nedo, and, germany, fraunhofer, institute, for, solar, energy, systems, ise, commercial, solar, water, heaters, began, appearing, in, the, united, states, in, the, 1890s, these, systems, saw, increasing, use, until, the, 1920s, but, were, gradually, replaced, by, cheaper, and, more, reliable, heating, fuels, as, with, photovoltaics, solar, water, heating, attracted, renewed, attention, as, a, result, of, the, oil, crises, in, the, 1970s, but, interest, subsided, in, the, 1980s, due, to, falling, petroleum, prices, development, in, the, solar, water, heating, sector, progressed, steadily, throughout, the, 1990s, and, annual, growth, rates, have, averaged, 20, since, 1999, although, generally, underestimated, solar, water, heating, and, cooling, is, by, far, the, most, widely, deployed, solar, technology, with, an, estimated, capacity, of, 154, gw, as, of, 2007, the, international, energy, agency, has, said, that, solar, energy, can, make, considerable, contributions, to, solving, some, of, the, most, urgent, problems, the, world, now, faces, the, development, of, affordable, inexhaustible, and, clean, solar, energy, technologies, will, have, huge, longer, term, benefits, it, will, increase, countries, energy, security, through, reliance, on, an, indigenous, inexhaustible, and, mostly, import, independent, resource, enhance, sustainability, reduce, pollution, lower, the, costs, of, mitigating, climate, change, and, keep, fossil, fuel, prices, lower, than, otherwise, these, advantages, are, global, hence, the, additional, costs, of, the, incentives, for, early, deployment, should, be, considered, learning, investments, they, must, be, wisely, spent, and, need, to, be, widely, shared, in, 2011, a, report, by, the, international, energy, agency, found, that, solar, energy, technologies, such, as, photovoltaics, solar, hot, water, and, concentrated, solar, power, could, provide, a, third, of, the, world, s, energy, by, 2060, if, politicians, commit, to, limiting, climate, change, and, transitioning, to, renewable, energy, the, energy, from, the, sun, could, play, a, key, role, in, de, carbonizing, the, global, economy, alongside, improvements, in, energy, efficiency, and, imposing, costs, on, greenhouse, gas, emitters, the, strength, of, solar, is, the, incredible, variety, and, flexibility, of, applications, from, small, scale, to, big, scale, we, have, proved, that, after, our, stores, of, oil, and, coal, are, exhausted, the, human, race, can, receive, unlimited, power, from, the, rays, of, the, sun, in, 2021, lazard, estimated, the, levelized, cost, of, new, build, unsubsidized, utility, scale, solar, electricity, at, less, than, 37, dollars, per, mwh, and, existing, coal, fired, power, above, that, amount, the, 2021, report, also, said, that, new, solar, was, also, cheaper, than, new, gas, fired, power, but, not, generally, existing, gas, power, concentrated, photovoltaics, cpv, systems, employ, sunlight, concentrated, onto, photovoltaic, surfaces, for, the, purpose, of, electricity, generation, thermoelectric, or, thermovoltaic, devices, convert, a, temperature, difference, between, dissimilar, materials, into, an, electric, current, floating, solar, or, floating, photovoltaics, fpv, sometimes, called, floatovoltaics, are, solar, panels, mounted, on, a, structure, that, floats, on, a, body, of, water, typically, a, reservoir, or, a, lake, such, as, drinking, water, reservoirs, quarry, lakes, irrigation, canals, or, remediation, and, tailing, ponds, the, systems, can, have, advantages, over, photovoltaics, pv, on, land, water, surfaces, may, be, less, expensive, than, the, cost, of, land, and, there, are, fewer, rules, and, regulations, for, structures, built, on, bodies, of, water, not, used, for, recreation, life, cycle, analysis, indicates, that, foam, based, fpv, have, some, of, the, shortest, energy, payback, times, 1, 3, years, and, the, lowest, greenhouse, gas, emissions, to, energy, ratio, 11, kg, co, 2, eq, mwh, in, crystalline, silicon, solar, photovoltaic, technologies, reported, floating, arrays, can, achieve, higher, efficiencies, than, pv, panels, on, land, because, water, cools, the, panels, the, panels, can, have, a, special, coating, to, prevent, rust, or, corrosion, the, market, for, this, renewable, energy, technology, has, grown, rapidly, since, 2016, the, first, 20, plants, with, capacities, of, a, few, dozen, kwp, were, built, between, 2007, and, 2013, installed, power, grew, from, 3, gw, in, 2020, to, 13, gw, in, 2022, surpassing, a, prediction, of, 10, gw, by, 2025, the, world, bank, estimated, there, are, 6, 600, large, bodies, of, water, suitable, for, floating, solar, with, a, technical, capacity, of, over, 4, 000, gw, if, 10, of, their, surfaces, were, covered, with, solar, panels, a, heat, pump, is, a, device, that, provides, heat, energy, from, a, source, of, heat, to, a, destination, called, a, heat, sink, heat, pumps, are, designed, to, move, thermal, energy, opposite, to, the, direction, of, spontaneous, heat, flow, by, absorbing, heat, from, a, cold, space, and, releasing, it, to, a, warmer, one, a, solar, assisted, heat, pump, represents, the, integration, of, a, heat, pump, and, thermal, solar, panels, in, a, single, integrated, system, typically, these, two, technologies, are, used, separately, or, only, placing, them, in, parallel, to, produce, hot, water, in, this, system, the, solar, thermal, panel, performs, the, function, of, the, low, temperature, heat, source, and, the, heat, produced, is, used, to, feed, the, heat, pump, s, evaporator, the, goal, of, this, system, is, to, get, high, cop, and, then, produce, energy, in, a, more, efficient, and, less, expensive, way, it, is, possible, to, use, any, type, of, solar, thermal, panel, sheet, and, tubes, roll, bond, heat, pipe, thermal, plates, or, hybrid, mono, polycrystalline, thin, film, in, combination, with, the, heat, pump, the, use, of, a, hybrid, panel, is, preferable, because, it, allows, covering, a, part, of, the, electricity, demand, of, the, heat, pump, and, reduces, the, power, consumption, and, consequently, the, variable, costs, of, the, system, an, electric, aircraft, is, an, aircraft, that, runs, on, electric, motors, rather, than, internal, combustion, engines, with, electricity, coming, from, fuel, cells, solar, cells, ultracapacitors, power, beaming, or, batteries, currently, flying, manned, electric, aircraft, are, mostly, experimental, demonstrators, though, many, small, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, are, powered, by, batteries, electrically, powered, model, aircraft, have, been, flown, since, the, 1970s, with, one, report, in, 1957, the, first, man, carrying, electrically, powered, flights, were, made, in, 1973, between, 2015, and, 2016, a, manned, solar, powered, plane,
