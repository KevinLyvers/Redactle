a, clutch, is, a, mechanical, device, that, allows, an, output, shaft, to, be, disconnected, from, a, rotating, input, shaft, the, clutch, s, input, shaft, is, typically, attached, to, a, motor, while, the, clutch, s, output, shaft, is, connected, to, the, mechanism, that, does, the, work, in, a, motor, vehicle, the, clutch, acts, as, a, mechanical, linkage, between, the, engine, and, transmission, by, disengaging, the, clutch, the, engine, speed, rpm, is, no, longer, determined, by, the, speed, of, the, driven, wheels, another, example, of, clutch, usage, is, in, electric, drills, the, clutch, s, input, shaft, is, driven, by, a, motor, and, the, output, shaft, is, connected, to, the, drill, bit, via, several, intermediate, components, the, clutch, allows, the, drill, bit, to, either, spin, at, the, same, speed, as, the, motor, clutch, engaged, spin, at, a, lower, speed, than, the, motor, clutch, slipping, or, remain, stationary, while, the, motor, is, spinning, clutch, disengaged, a, dry, clutch, uses, dry, friction, to, transfer, power, from, the, input, shaft, to, the, output, shaft, for, example, a, friction, disk, presses, against, a, car, engine, s, flywheel, by, a, spring, mechanism, the, wheels, of, the, vehicle, only, rotate, when, the, flywheel, is, in, contact, with, the, friction, disk, to, stop, the, transfer, of, power, the, friction, disk, is, moved, away, from, the, flywheel, by, means, of, a, lever, mechanism, the, majority, of, automotive, clutches, on, manual, transmissions, are, dry, clutches, slippage, of, a, friction, clutch, where, the, clutch, is, partially, engaged, but, the, shafts, are, rotating, at, different, speeds, is, sometimes, required, such, as, when, a, motor, vehicle, accelerates, from, a, standstill, however, the, slippage, should, be, minimised, to, avoid, increased, wear, rates, in, a, pull, type, clutch, pressing, the, pedal, pulls, the, release, bearing, to, disengage, the, clutch, in, a, push, type, clutch, pressing, the, pedal, pushes, the, release, bearing, to, disengage, the, clutch, a, multi, plate, clutch, consists, of, several, friction, plates, arranged, concentrically, in, some, cases, it, is, used, instead, of, a, larger, diameter, clutch, drag, racing, cars, use, multi, plate, clutches, to, control, the, rate, of, power, transfer, to, the, wheels, as, the, vehicle, accelerates, from, a, standing, start, some, clutch, disks, include, springs, designed, to, change, the, natural, frequency, of, the, clutch, disc, in, order, to, reduce, nvh, within, the, vehicle, also, some, clutches, for, manual, transmission, cars, use, a, clutch, delay, valve, to, avoid, abrupt, engagements, of, the, clutch, in, a, wet, clutch, the, friction, material, sits, in, an, oil, bath, or, has, flow, through, oil, which, cools, and, lubricates, the, clutch, this, can, provide, smoother, engagement, and, a, longer, lifespan, of, the, clutch, however, wet, clutches, can, have, a, lower, efficiency, due, to, some, energy, being, transferred, to, the, oil, since, the, surfaces, of, a, wet, clutch, can, be, slippery, as, with, a, motorcycle, clutch, bathed, in, engine, oil, stacking, multiple, clutch, discs, can, compensate, for, the, lower, coefficient, of, friction, and, so, eliminate, slippage, under, power, when, fully, engaged, wet, clutches, often, use, a, composite, paper, material, a, centrifugal, clutch, automatically, engages, as, the, speed, of, the, input, shaft, increases, and, disengages, as, the, input, shaft, speed, decreases, applications, include, small, motorcycles, motor, scooters, chainsaws, and, some, older, automobiles, a, cone, clutch, is, similar, to, dry, friction, plate, clutch, except, the, friction, material, is, applied, to, the, outside, of, a, conical, shaped, object, a, common, application, for, cone, clutches, is, the, synchronizer, ring, in, a, manual, transmission, a, dog, clutch, is, a, non, slip, design, of, clutch, which, is, used, in, non, synchronous, transmissions, the, single, revolution, clutch, was, developed, in, the, 19th, century, to, power, machinery, such, as, shears, or, presses, where, a, single, pull, of, the, operating, lever, or, later, press, of, a, button, would, trip, the, mechanism, engaging, the, clutch, between, the, power, source, and, the, machine, s, crankshaft, for, exactly, one, revolution, before, disengaging, the, clutch, when, the, clutch, is, disengaged, the, driven, member, is, stationary, early, designs, were, typically, dog, clutches, with, a, cam, on, the, driven, member, used, to, disengage, the, dogs, at, the, appropriate, point, greatly, simplified, single, revolution, clutches, were, developed, in, the, 20th, century, requiring, much, smaller, operating, forces, and, in, some, variations, allowing, for, a, fixed, fraction, of, a, revolution, per, operation, fast, action, friction, clutches, replaced, dog, clutches, in, some, applications, eliminating, the, problem, of, impact, loading, on, the, dogs, every, time, the, clutch, engaged, in, addition, to, their, use, in, heavy, manufacturing, equipment, single, revolution, clutches, were, applied, to, numerous, small, machines, in, tabulating, machines, for, example, pressing, the, operate, key, would, trip, a, single, revolution, clutch, to, process, the, most, recently, entered, number, in, typesetting, machines, pressing, any, key, selected, a, particular, character, and, also, engaged, a, single, rotation, clutch, to, cycle, the, mechanism, to, typeset, that, character, similarly, in, teleprinters, the, receipt, of, each, character, tripped, a, single, revolution, clutch, to, operate, one, cycle, of, the, print, mechanism, in, 1928, frederick, g, creed, developed, a, single, turn, wrap, spring, clutch, that, was, particularly, well, suited, to, the, repetitive, start, stop, action, required, in, teleprinters, in, 1942, two, employees, of, pitney, bowes, postage, meter, company, developed, an, improved, single, turn, spring, clutch, in, these, clutches, a, coil, spring, is, wrapped, around, the, driven, shaft, and, held, in, an, expanded, configuration, by, the, trip, lever, when, tripped, the, spring, rapidly, contracts, around, the, power, shaft, engaging, the, clutch, at, the, end, of, one, revolution, if, the, trip, lever, has, been, reset, it, catches, the, end, of, the, spring, or, a, pawl, attached, to, it, and, the, angular, momentum, of, the, driven, member, releases, the, tension, on, the, spring, these, clutches, have, long, operating, lives, many, have, performed, tens, and, perhaps, hundreds, of, millions, of, cycles, without, the, need, of, maintenance, other, than, occasional, lubrication, cascaded, pawl, single, revolution, clutches, superseded, wrap, spring, single, revolution, clutches, in, page, printers, such, as, teleprinters, including, the, teletype, model, 28, and, its, successors, using, the, same, design, principles, ibm, selectric, typewriters, also, used, them, these, are, typically, disc, shaped, assemblies, mounted, on, the, driven, shaft, inside, the, hollow, disc, shaped, drive, drum, are, two, or, three, freely, floating, pawls, arranged, so, that, when, the, clutch, is, tripped, the, pawls, spring, outward, much, like, the, shoes, in, a, drum, brake, when, engaged, the, load, torque, on, each, pawl, transfers, to, the, others, to, keep, them, engaged, these, clutches, do, not, slip, once, locked, up, and, they, engage, very, quickly, on, the, order, of, milliseconds, a, trip, projection, extends, out, from, the, assembly, if, the, trip, lever, engaged, this, projection, the, clutch, was, disengaged, when, the, trip, lever, releases, this, projection, internal, springs, and, friction, engage, the, clutch, the, clutch, then, rotates, one, or, more, turns, stopping, when, the, trip, lever, again, engages, the, trip, projection, most, cars, and, trucks, with, a, manual, transmission, use, a, dry, clutch, which, is, operated, by, the, driver, using, the, left, most, pedal, the, motion, of, the, pedal, is, transferred, to, the, clutch, using, hydraulics, master, and, slave, cylinders, or, a, cable, the, clutch, is, only, disengaged, at, times, when, the, driver, is, pressing, on, the, clutch, pedal, therefore, the, default, state, is, for, the, transmission, to, be, connected, to, the, engine, a, neutral, gear, position, is, provided, so, that, the, clutch, pedal, can, be, released, with, the, vehicle, remaining, stationary, the, clutch, is, required, for, standing, starts, and, is, usually, but, not, always, used, to, assist, in, synchronising, the, speeds, of, the, engine, and, transmission, during, gear, changes, i, e, while, reducing, the, engine, speed, rpm, during, upshifts, and, increasing, the, engine, speed, during, downshifts, the, clutch, is, usually, mounted, directly, to, the, face, of, the, engine, s, flywheel, as, this, already, provides, a, convenient, large, diameter, steel, disk, that, can, act, as, one, driving, plate, of, the, clutch, some, racing, clutches, use, small, multi, plate, disk, packs, that, are, not, part, of, the, flywheel, both, clutch, and, flywheel, are, enclosed, in, a, conical, bellhousing, for, the, gearbox, the, friction, material, used, for, the, clutch, disk, varies, with, a, common, material, being, an, organic, compound, resin, with, a, copper, wire, facing, or, a, ceramic, material, in, an, automatic, transmission, the, role, of, the, clutch, is, performed, by, a, torque, converter, however, the, transmission, itself, often, includes, internal, clutches, such, as, a, lock, up, clutch, to, prevent, slippage, of, the, torque, converter, in, order, to, reduce, the, energy, loss, through, the, transmission, and, therefore, improve, fuel, economy, older, belt, driven, engine, cooling, fans, often, use, a, heat, activated, clutch, in, the, form, of, a, bimetallic, strip, when, the, temperature, is, low, the, spring, winds, and, closes, the, valve, which, lets, the, fan, spin, at, about, 20, to, 30, of, the, crankshaft, speed, as, the, temperature, of, the, spring, rises, it, unwinds, and, opens, the, valve, allowing, fluid, past, the, valve, making, the, fan, spin, at, about, 60, to, 90, of, crankshaft, speed, a, vehicle, s, air, conditioning, compressor, often, uses, magnetic, clutches, to, engage, the, compressor, as, required, motorcycles, typically, employ, a, wet, clutch, with, the, clutch, riding, in, the, same, oil, as, the, transmission, these, clutches, are, usually, made, up, of, a, stack, of, alternating, friction, plates, and, steel, plates, the, friction, plates, have, lugs, on, their, outer, diameters, that, lock, them, into, a, basket, that, is, turned, by, the, crankshaft, the, steel, plates, have, lugs, on, their, inner, diameters, that, lock, them, to, the, transmission, input, shaft, a, set, of, coil, springs, or, a, diaphragm, spring, plate, force, the, plates, together, when, the, clutch, is, engaged, on, motorcycles, the, clutch, is, operated, by, a, hand, lever, on, the, left, handlebar, no, pressure, on, the, lever, means, that, the, clutch, plates, are, engaged, driving, while, pulling, the, lever, back, towards, the, rider, disengages, the, clutch, plates, through, cable, or, hydraulic, actuation, allowing, the, rider, to, shift, gears, or, coast, racing, motorcycles, often, use, slipper, clutches, to, eliminate, the, effects, of, engine, braking, which, being, applied, only, to, the, rear, wheel, can, cause, instability
