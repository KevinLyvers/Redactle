infrastructure, is, the, set, of, facilities, and, systems, that, serve, a, country, city, or, other, area, and, encompasses, the, services, and, facilities, necessary, for, its, economy, households, and, firms, to, function, infrastructure, is, composed, of, public, and, private, physical, structures, such, as, roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, water, supply, sewers, electrical, grids, and, telecommunications, including, internet, connectivity, and, broadband, access, in, general, infrastructure, has, been, defined, as, the, physical, components, of, interrelated, systems, providing, commodities, and, services, essential, to, enable, sustain, or, enhance, societal, living, conditions, and, maintain, the, surrounding, environment, especially, in, light, of, the, massive, societal, transformations, needed, to, mitigate, and, adapt, to, climate, change, contemporary, infrastructure, conversations, frequently, focus, on, sustainable, development, and, green, infrastructure, acknowledging, this, importance, the, international, community, has, created, policy, focused, on, sustainable, infrastructure, through, the, sustainable, development, goals, especially, sustainable, development, goal, 9, industry, innovation, and, infrastructure, one, way, to, describe, different, types, of, infrastructure, is, to, classify, them, as, two, distinct, kinds, hard, infrastructure, and, soft, infrastructure, hard, infrastructure, is, the, physical, networks, necessary, for, the, functioning, of, a, modern, industrial, society, or, industry, this, includes, roads, bridges, and, railways, soft, infrastructure, is, all, the, institutions, that, maintain, the, economic, health, social, environmental, and, cultural, standards, of, a, country, this, includes, educational, programs, official, statistics, parks, and, recreational, facilities, law, enforcement, agencies, and, emergency, services, the, word, infrastructure, has, been, used, in, french, since, 1875, and, in, english, since, 1887, originally, meaning, installations, that, form, the, basis, for, any, operation, or, system, it, is, a, loanword, from, french, where, it, was, already, used, for, establishing, a, roadbed, of, substrate, material, required, before, railroad, tracks, or, constructed, pavement, could, be, laid, on, top, of, it, the, word, is, a, combination, of, the, latin, prefix, infra, meaning, below, as, many, of, these, constructions, are, underground, for, example, tunnels, water, and, gas, systems, and, railways, and, the, french, word, structure, the, army, use, of, the, term, achieved, currency, in, the, united, states, after, the, formation, of, nato, in, the, 1940s, and, by, 1970, was, adopted, by, urban, planners, in, its, modern, civilian, sense, a, 1987, us, national, research, council, panel, adopted, the, term, public, works, infrastructure, referring, to, both, specific, functional, modes, highways, streets, roads, and, bridges, mass, transit, airports, and, airways, water, supply, and, water, resources, wastewater, management, solid, waste, treatment, and, disposal, electric, power, generation, and, transmission, telecommunications, and, hazardous, waste, management, and, the, combined, system, these, modal, elements, comprise, a, comprehension, of, infrastructure, spans, not, only, these, public, works, facilities, but, also, the, operating, procedures, management, practices, and, development, policies, that, interact, together, with, societal, demand, and, the, physical, world, to, facilitate, the, transport, of, people, and, goods, provision, of, water, for, drinking, and, a, variety, of, other, uses, safe, disposal, of, society, s, waste, products, provision, of, energy, where, it, is, needed, and, transmission, of, information, within, and, between, communities, the, american, society, of, civil, engineers, publishes, an, infrastructure, report, card, which, represents, the, organizations, opinion, on, the, condition, of, various, infrastructure, every, 2, 4, years, as, of, 2017, they, grade, 16, categories, namely, aviation, bridges, dams, drinking, water, energy, hazardous, waste, inland, waterways, levees, parks, and, recreation, ports, rail, roads, schools, solid, waste, transit, and, wastewater, 4, the, united, states, has, received, a, rating, of, d, on, its, infrastructure, this, aging, infrastructure, is, a, result, of, governmental, neglect, and, inadequate, funding, as, the, united, states, presumably, looks, to, upgrade, its, existing, infrastructure, sustainable, measures, could, be, a, consideration, of, the, design, build, and, operation, plans, a, way, to, embody, personal, infrastructure, is, to, think, of, it, in, terms, of, human, capital, human, capital, is, defined, by, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, as, intangible, collective, resources, possessed, by, individuals, and, groups, within, a, given, population, the, goal, of, personal, infrastructure, is, to, determine, the, quality, of, the, economic, agents, values, this, results, in, three, major, tasks, the, task, of, economic, proxies, in, the, economic, process, teachers, unskilled, and, qualified, labor, etc, the, importance, of, personal, infrastructure, for, an, individual, short, and, long, term, consumption, of, education, and, the, social, relevance, of, personal, infrastructure, essentially, personal, infrastructure, maps, the, human, impact, on, infrastructure, as, it, is, related, to, the, economy, individual, growth, and, social, impact, institutional, infrastructure, branches, from, the, term, economic, constitution, according, to, gianpiero, torrisi, institutional, infrastructure, is, the, object, of, economic, and, legal, policy, it, compromises, the, growth, and, sets, norms, it, refers, to, the, degree, of, fair, treatment, of, equal, economic, data, and, determines, the, framework, within, which, economic, agents, may, formulate, their, own, economic, plans, and, carry, them, out, in, co, operation, with, others, sustainable, infrastructure, refers, to, the, processes, of, design, and, construction, that, take, into, consideration, their, environmental, economic, and, social, impact, included, in, this, section, are, several, elements, of, sustainable, schemes, including, materials, water, energy, transportation, and, waste, management, infrastructure, although, there, are, endless, other, factors, of, consideration, those, will, not, be, covered, in, this, section, material, infrastructure, is, defined, as, those, immobile, non, circulating, capital, goods, that, essentially, contribute, to, the, production, of, infrastructure, goods, and, services, needed, to, satisfy, basic, physical, and, social, requirements, of, economic, agents, there, are, two, distinct, qualities, of, material, infrastructures, 1, fulfillment, of, social, needs, and, 2, mass, production, the, first, characteristic, deals, with, the, basic, needs, of, human, life, the, second, characteristic, is, the, non, availability, of, infrastructure, goods, and, services, today, there, are, various, materials, that, can, be, used, to, build, infrastructure, the, most, prevalent, ones, are, asphalt, concrete, steel, masonry, wood, polymers, and, composites, according, to, the, business, dictionary, economic, infrastructure, can, be, defined, as, internal, facilities, of, a, country, that, make, business, activity, possible, such, as, communication, transportation, and, distribution, networks, financial, institutions, and, related, international, markets, and, energy, supply, systems, economic, infrastructure, support, productive, activities, and, events, this, includes, roads, highways, bridges, airports, cycling, infrastructure, water, distribution, networks, sewer, systems, and, irrigation, plants, social, infrastructure, can, be, broadly, defined, as, the, construction, and, maintenance, of, facilities, that, support, social, services, social, infrastructures, are, created, to, increase, social, comfort, and, promote, economic, activity, these, include, schools, parks, and, playgrounds, structures, for, public, safety, waste, disposal, plants, hospitals, and, sports, areas, core, assets, provide, essential, services, and, have, monopolistic, characteristics, investors, seeking, core, infrastructure, look, for, five, different, characteristics, income, low, volatility, of, returns, diversification, inflation, protection, and, long, term, liability, matching, core, infrastructure, incorporates, all, the, main, types, of, infrastructure, such, as, roads, highways, railways, public, transportation, water, and, gas, supply, basic, infrastructure, refers, to, main, railways, roads, canals, harbors, and, docks, the, electromagnetic, telegraph, drainage, dikes, and, land, reclamation, it, consist, of, the, more, well, known, and, common, features, of, infrastructure, that, we, come, across, in, our, daily, lives, buildings, roads, docks, complementary, infrastructure, refers, to, things, like, light, railways, tramways, and, gas, electricity, water, supply, to, complement, something, means, to, bring, it, to, perfection, or, complete, it, complementary, infrastructure, deals, with, the, little, parts, of, the, engineering, world, that, make, life, more, convenient, and, efficient, they, are, needed, to, ensure, successful, usage, and, marketing, of, an, already, finished, product, like, in, the, case, of, road, bridges, other, examples, are, lights, on, sidewalks, landscaping, around, buildings, and, benches, where, pedestrians, can, rest, engineers, generally, limit, the, term, infrastructure, to, describe, fixed, assets, that, are, in, the, form, of, a, large, network, in, other, words, hard, infrastructure, efforts, to, devise, more, generic, definitions, of, infrastructures, have, typically, referred, to, the, network, aspects, of, most, of, the, structures, and, to, the, accumulated, value, of, investments, in, the, networks, as, assets, one, such, definition, from, 1998, defined, infrastructure, as, the, network, of, assets, where, the, system, as, a, whole, is, intended, to, be, maintained, indefinitely, at, a, specified, standard, of, service, by, the, continuing, replacement, and, refurbishment, of, its, components, civil, defense, planners, and, developmental, economists, generally, refer, to, both, hard, and, soft, infrastructure, including, public, services, such, as, schools, and, hospitals, emergency, services, such, as, police, and, fire, fighting, and, basic, services, in, the, economic, sector, the, notion, of, infrastructure, based, development, combining, long, term, infrastructure, investments, by, government, agencies, at, central, and, regional, levels, with, public, private, partnerships, has, proven, popular, among, economists, in, asia, notably, singapore, and, china, mainland, europe, and, latin, america, military, infrastructure, is, the, buildings, and, permanent, installations, necessary, for, the, support, of, military, forces, whether, they, are, stationed, in, bases, being, deployed, or, engaged, in, operations, examples, include, barracks, headquarters, airfields, communications, facilities, stores, of, military, equipment, port, installations, and, maintenance, stations, communications, infrastructure, is, the, informal, and, formal, channels, of, communication, political, and, social, networks, or, beliefs, held, by, members, of, particular, groups, as, well, as, information, technology, software, development, tools, still, underlying, these, more, conceptual, uses, is, the, idea, that, infrastructure, provides, organizing, structure, and, support, for, the, system, or, organization, it, serves, whether, it, is, a, city, a, nation, a, corporation, or, a, collection, of, people, with, common, interests, examples, include, it, infrastructure, research, infrastructure, terrorist, infrastructure, employment, infrastructure, and, tourism, infrastructure, the, term, infrastructure, may, be, confused, with, the, following, overlapping, or, related, concepts, land, improvement, and, land, development, are, general, terms, that, in, some, contexts, may, include, infrastructure, but, in, the, context, of, a, discussion, of, infrastructure, would, refer, only, to, smaller, scale, systems, or, works, that, are, not, included, in, infrastructure, because, they, are, typically, limited, to, a, single, parcel, of, land, and, are, owned, and, operated, by, the, landowner, for, example, an, irrigation, canal, that, serves, a, region, or, district, would, be, included, with, infrastructure, but, the, private, irrigation, systems, on, individual, land, parcels, would, be, considered, land, improvements, not, infrastructure, service, connections, to, municipal, service, and, public, utility, networks, would, also, be, considered, land, improvements, not, infrastructure, the, term, public, works, includes, government, owned, and, operated, infrastructure, as, well, as, public, buildings, such, as, schools, and, courthouses, public, works, generally, refers, to, physical, assets, needed, to, deliver, public, services, public, services, include, both, infrastructure, and, services, generally, provided, by, the, government, infrastructure, may, be, owned, and, managed, by, governments, or, by, privately, held, companies, such, as, sole, public, utility, or, railway, companies, generally, most, roads, major, airports, and, other, ports, water, distribution, systems, and, sewage, networks, are, publicly, owned, whereas, most, energy, and, telecommunications, networks, are, privately, owned, publicly, owned, infrastructure, may, be, paid, for, from, taxes, tolls, or, metered, user, fees, whereas, private, infrastructure, is, generally, paid, for, by, metered, user, fees, major, investment, projects, are, generally, financed, by, the, issuance, of, long, term, bonds, government, owned, and, operated, infrastructure, may, be, developed, and, operated, in, the, private, sector, or, in, public, private, partnerships, in, addition, to, in, the, public, sector, as, of, 2008, in, the, united, states, for, example, public, spending, on, infrastructure, has, varied, between, 2, 3, and, 3, 6, of, gdp, since, 1950, many, financial, institutions, invest, in, infrastructure, according, to, researchers, at, the, overseas, development, institute, the, lack, of, infrastructure, in, many, developing, countries, represents, one, of, the, most, significant, limitations, to, economic, growth, and, achievement, of, the, millennium, development, goals, mdgs, infrastructure, investments, and, maintenance, can, be, very, expensive, especially, in, such, areas, as, landlocked, rural, and, sparsely, populated, countries, in, africa, it, has, been, argued, that, infrastructure, investments, contributed, to, more, than, half, of, africa, s, improved, growth, performance, between, 1990, and, 2005, and, increased, investment, is, necessary, to, maintain, growth, and, tackle, poverty, the, returns, to, investment, in, infrastructure, are, very, significant, with, on, average, thirty, to, forty, percent, returns, for, telecommunications, ict, investments, over, forty, percent, for, electricity, generation, and, eighty, percent, for, roads, the, demand, for, infrastructure, both, by, consumers, and, by, companies, is, much, higher, than, the, amount, invested, there, are, severe, constraints, on, the, supply, side, of, the, provision, of, infrastructure, in, asia, the, infrastructure, financing, gap, between, what, is, invested, in, asia, pacific, around, us, 48, billion, and, what, is, needed, us, 228, billion, is, around, us, 180, billion, every, year, in, latin, america, three, percent, of, gdp, around, us, 71, billion, would, need, to, be, invested, in, infrastructure, in, order, to, satisfy, demand, yet, in, 2005, for, example, only, around, two, percent, was, invested, leaving, a, financing, gap, of, approximately, us, 24, billion, in, africa, in, order, to, reach, the, seven, percent, annual, growth, calculated, to, be, required, to, meet, the, mdgs, by, 2015, would, require, infrastructure, investments, of, about, fifteen, percent, of, gdp, or, around, us, 93, billion, a, year, in, fragile, states, over, thirty, seven, percent, of, gdp, would, be, required, the, source, of, financing, for, infrastructure, varies, significantly, across, sectors, some, sectors, are, dominated, by, government, spending, others, by, overseas, development, aid, oda, and, yet, others, by, private, investors, in, california, infrastructure, financing, districts, are, established, by, local, governments, to, pay, for, physical, facilities, and, services, within, a, specified, area, by, using, property, tax, increases, in, order, to, facilitate, investment, of, the, private, sector, in, developing, countries, infrastructure, markets, it, is, necessary, to, design, risk, allocation, mechanisms, more, carefully, given, the, higher, risks, of, their, markets, the, spending, money, that, comes, from, the, government, is, less, than, it, used, to, be, from, the, 1930s, to, 2019, the, united, states, went, from, spending, 4, 2, of, gdp, to, 2, 5, of, gdp, on, infrastructure, these, under, investments, have, accrued, in, fact, according, to, the, 2017, asce, infrastructure, report, card, from, 2016, to, 2025, infrastructure, will, be, underinvested, by, 2, trillion, compared, to, the, global, gdp, percentages, the, united, states, is, tied, for, second, to, last, place, with, an, average, percentage, of, 2, 4, this, means, that, the, government, spends, less, money, on, repairing, old, infrastructure, and, or, on, infrastructure, as, a, whole, in, sub, saharan, africa, governments, spend, around, us, 9, 4, billion, out, of, a, total, of, us, 24, 9, billion, in, irrigation, governments, represent, almost, all, spending, in, transport, and, energy, a, majority, of, investment, is, government, spending, in, ict, and, water, supply, and, sanitation, the, private, sector, represents, the, majority, of, capital, expenditure, overall, between, them, aid, the, private, sector, and, non, oecd, financiers, exceed, government, spending, the, private, sector, spending, alone, equals, state, capital, expenditure, though, the, majority, is, focused, on, ict, infrastructure, investments, external, financing, increased, in, the, 2000s, decade, and, in, africa, alone, external, infrastructure, investments, increased, from, us, 7, billion, in, 2002, to, us, 27, billion, in, 2009, china, in, particular, has, emerged, as, an, important, investor, the, 2020, covid, 19, pandemic, has, only, exacerbated, the, underfunding, of, infrastructure, globally, that, has, been, accumulating, for, decades, the, pandemic, has, increased, unemployment, and, has, widely, disrupted, the, economy, this, has, serious, impacts, on, households, businesses, and, federal, state, and, local, governments, this, is, especially, detrimental, to, infrastructure, because, it, is, so, dependent, on, funding, from, government, agencies, with, state, and, local, governments, accounting, for, approximately, 75, of, spending, on, public, infrastructure, in, the, united, states, governments, are, facing, enormous, decreases, in, revenue, economic, downturns, overworked, health, systems, and, hesitant, workforces, resulting, in, huge, budget, deficits, across, the, board, however, they, must, also, scale, up, public, investment, to, ensure, successful, reopening, boost, growth, and, employment, and, green, their, economies, the, unusually, large, scale, of, the, packages, needed, for, covid, 19, was, accompanied, by, widespread, calls, for, greening, them, to, meet, the, dual, goals, of, economic, recovery, and, environmental, sustainability, however, as, of, march, 2021, only, a, small, fraction, of, the, g20, covid, 19, related, fiscal, measures, was, found, to, be, climate, friendly, although, it, is, readily, apparent, that, much, effort, is, needed, to, repair, the, economic, damage, inflicted, by, the, coronavirus, epidemic, an, immediate, return, to, business, as, usual, could, be, environmentally, harmful, as, shown, by, the, 2007, 08, financial, crisis, in, the, united, states, while, the, ensuing, economic, slowdown, reduced, global, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, 2009, emissions, reached, a, record, high, in, 2010, partially, due, to, governments, implemented, economic, stimulus, measures, with, minimal, consideration, of, the, environmental, consequences, the, concern, is, whether, this, same, pattern, will, repeat, itself, the, post, covid, 19, period, could, determine, whether, the, world, meets, or, misses, the, emissions, goals, of, the, 2015, paris, agreement, and, limits, global, warming, to, 1, 5, degrees, c, to, 2, degrees, c, as, a, result, of, the, covid, 19, epidemic, a, host, of, factors, could, jeopardize, a, low, carbon, recovery, plan, this, includes, reduced, attention, on, the, global, political, stage, 2020, un, climate, summit, has, been, postponed, to, 2021, the, relaxing, of, environmental, regulations, in, pursuit, of, economic, growth, decreased, oil, prices, preventing, low, carbon, technologies, from, being, competitive, and, finally, stimulus, programs, that, take, away, funds, that, could, have, been, used, to, further, the, process, of, decarbonization, research, suggests, that, a, recovery, plan, based, on, lower, carbon, emissions, could, not, only, make, significant, emissions, reductions, needed, to, battle, climate, change, but, also, create, more, economic, growth, and, jobs, than, a, high, carbon, recovery, plan, would, a, study, published, in, the, oxford, review, of, economic, policy, more, than, 200, economists, and, economic, officials, reported, that, green, economic, recovery, initiatives, performed, at, least, as, well, as, less, green, initiatives, there, have, also, been, calls, for, an, independent, body, could, provide, a, comparable, assessment, of, countries, fiscal, policies, promoting, transparency, and, accountability, at, the, international, level, in, addition, in, an, econometric, study, published, in, the, economic, modelling, journal, an, analysis, on, government, energy, technology, spending, showed, that, spending, on, the, renewable, energy, sector, created, five, more, jobs, per, million, dollars, invested, than, spending, on, fossil, fuels, since, sustainable, infrastructure, is, more, beneficial, in, both, an, economic, and, environmental, context, it, represents, the, future, of, infrastructure, especially, with, increasing, pressure, from, climate, change, and, diminishing, natural, resources, infrastructure, not, only, needs, to, maintain, economic, development, and, job, development, and, a, high, quality, of, life, for, residents, but, also, protect, the, environment, and, its, natural, resources, sustainable, energy, infrastructure, includes, types, of, renewable, energy, power, plants, as, well, as, the, means, of, exchange, from, the, plant, to, the, homes, and, businesses, that, use, that, energy, renewable, energy, includes, well, researched, and, widely, implemented, methods, such, as, wind, solar, and, hydraulic, power, as, well, as, newer, and, less, commonly, used, types, of, power, creation, such, as, fusion, energy, sustainable, energy, infrastructure, must, maintain, a, strong, supply, relative, to, demand, and, must, also, maintain, sufficiently, low, prices, for, consumers, so, as, not, to, decrease, demand, any, type, of, renewable, energy, infrastructure, that, fails, to, meet, these, consumption, and, price, requirements, will, ultimately, be, forced, out, of, the, market, by, prevailing, non, renewable, energy, sources, sustainable, water, infrastructure, is, focused, on, a, community, s, sufficient, access, to, clean, safe, drinking, water, water, is, a, public, good, along, with, electricity, which, means, that, sustainable, water, catchment, and, distribution, systems, must, remain, affordable, to, all, members, of, a, population, sustainable, water, may, refer, to, a, nation, or, community, s, ability, to, be, self, sustainable, with, enough, water, to, meet, multiple, needs, including, agriculture, industry, sanitation, and, drinking, water, it, can, also, refer, to, the, holistic, and, effective, management, of, water, resources, increasingly, policy, makers, and, regulators, are, incorporating, nature, based, solutions, nbs, or, nbs, into, attempts, to, achieve, sustainable, water, infrastructure, sustainable, waste, management, systems, aim, to, minimize, the, amount, of, waste, products, produced, by, individuals, and, corporations, commercial, waste, management, plans, have, transitioned, from, simple, waste, removal, plans, into, comprehensive, plans, focused, on, reducing, the, total, amount, of, waste, produced, before, removal, sustainable, waste, management, is, beneficial, environmentally, and, can, also, cut, costs, for, businesses, that, reduce, their, amount, of, disposed, goods, sustainable, transportation, includes, a, shift, away, from, private, greenhouse, gas, emitting, cars, in, favor, of, adopting, methods, of, transportation, that, are, either, carbon, neutral, or, reduce, carbon, emissions, such, as, bikes, or, electric, bus, systems, additionally, cities, must, invest, in, the, appropriate, built, environments, for, these, ecologically, preferable, modes, of, transportation, cities, will, need, to, invest, in, public, transportation, networks, as, well, as, bike, path, networks, among, other, sustainable, solutions, that, incentivize, citizens, to, use, these, alternate, transit, options, reducing, the, urban, dependency, on, cars, is, a, fundamental, goal, of, developing, sustainable, transportation, and, this, cannot, be, accomplished, without, a, coordinated, focus, on, both, creating, the, methods, of, transportation, themselves, and, providing, them, with, networks, that, are, equally, or, more, efficient, than, existing, car, networks, such, as, aging, highway, systems, another, solution, to, transition, into, a, more, sustainable, infrastructure, is, using, more, sustainable, materials, a, material, is, sustainable, if, the, needed, amount, can, be, produced, without, depleting, non, renewable, resources, it, also, should, have, low, environmental, impacts, by, not, disrupting, the, established, steady, state, equilibrium, of, it, the, materials, should, also, be, resilient, renewable, reusable, and, recyclable, today, concrete, is, one, of, the, most, common, materials, used, in, infrastructure, there, is, twice, as, much, concrete, used, in, construction, than, all, other, building, materials, combined, it, is, the, backbone, of, industrialization, as, it, is, used, in, bridges, piers, pipelines, pavements, and, buildings, however, while, they, do, serve, as, a, connection, between, cities, transportation, for, people, and, goods, and, protection, for, land, against, flooding, and, erosion, they, only, last, for, 50, to, 100, years, many, were, built, within, the, last, 50, years, which, means, many, infrastructures, need, substantial, maintenance, to, continue, functioning, however, concrete, is, not, sustainable, the, production, of, concrete, contributes, up, to, 8, of, the, world, s, greenhouse, gas, emissions, a, tenth, of, the, world, s, industrial, water, usage, is, from, producing, concrete, even, transporting, the, raw, materials, to, concrete, production, sites, adds, to, airborne, pollution, furthermore, the, production, sites, and, the, infrastructures, themselves, all, strip, away, agricultural, land, that, could, have, been, fertile, soil, or, habitats, vital, to, the, ecosystem, green, infrastructure, is, a, type, of, sustainable, infrastructure, green, infrastructure, uses, plant, or, soil, systems, to, restore, some, of, the, natural, processes, needed, to, manage, water, and, create, healthier, urban, environments, in, a, more, practical, sense, it, refers, to, a, decentralized, network, of, stormwater, management, practices, which, includes, green, roofs, trees, bioretention, and, infiltration, and, permeable, pavement, green, infrastructure, has, become, an, increasingly, popular, strategy, in, recent, years, due, to, its, effectiveness, in, providing, ecological, economic, and, social, benefits, including, positively, impacting, energy, consumption, air, quality, and, carbon, reduction, and, sequestration, a, green, roof, is, a, rooftop, that, is, partially, or, completely, covered, with, growing, vegetation, planted, over, a, membrane, it, also, includes, additional, layers, including, a, root, barrier, and, drainage, and, irrigation, systems, there, are, several, categories, of, green, roofs, including, extensive, have, a, growing, media, depth, ranging, from, two, to, six, inches, and, intensive, have, a, growing, media, with, a, depth, greater, than, six, inches, one, benefit, of, green, roofs, is, that, they, reduce, stormwater, runoff, because, of, its, ability, to, store, water, in, its, growing, media, reducing, the, runoff, entering, the, sewer, system, and, waterways, which, also, decreases, the, risk, of, combined, sewer, overflows, they, reduce, energy, usage, since, the, growing, media, provides, additional, insulation, reduces, the, amount, of, solar, radiation, on, the, roof, s, surface, and, provides, evaporative, cooling, from, water, in, the, plants, which, reduce, the, roof, surface, temperatures, and, heat, influx, green, roofs, also, reduce, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, since, the, vegetation, sequesters, carbon, and, since, they, reduce, energy, usage, and, the, urban, heat, island, by, reducing, the, roof, temperature, they, also, lower, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, electricity, generation, tree, planting, provides, a, host, of, ecological, social, and, economic, benefits, trees, can, intercept, rain, support, infiltration, and, water, storage, in, soil, diminish, the, impact, of, raindrops, on, barren, surfaces, minimize, soil, moisture, through, transpiration, and, they, help, reduce, stormwater, runoff, additionally, trees, contribute, to, recharging, local, aquifers, and, improve, the, health, of, watershed, systems, trees, also, reduce, energy, usage, by, providing, shade, and, releasing, water, into, the, atmosphere, which, cools, the, air, and, reduces, the, amount, of, heat, absorbed, by, buildings, finally, trees, improve, air, quality, by, absorbing, harmful, air, pollutants, reducing, the, amount, of, greenhouse, gases, there, are, a, variety, of, types, of, bioretention, and, infiltration, practices, including, rain, gardens, and, bioswales, a, rain, garden, is, planted, in, a, small, depression, or, natural, slope, and, includes, native, shrubs, and, flowers, they, temporarily, hold, and, absorb, rain, water, and, are, effective, in, removing, up, to, 90, of, nutrients, and, chemicals, and, up, to, 80, of, sediments, from, the, runoff, as, a, result, they, soak, 30, more, water, than, conventional, gardens, bioswales, are, planted, in, paved, areas, like, parking, lots, or, sidewalks, and, are, made, to, allow, for, overflow, into, the, sewer, system, by, trapping, silt, and, other, pollutants, which, are, normally, left, over, from, impermeable, surfaces, both, rain, gardens, and, bioswales, mitigate, flood, impacts, and, prevent, stormwater, from, polluting, local, waterways, increase, the, usable, water, supply, by, reducing, the, amount, of, water, needed, for, outdoor, irrigation, improve, air, quality, by, minimizing, the, amount, of, water, going, into, treatment, facilities, which, also, reduces, energy, usage, and, as, a, result, reduces, air, pollution, since, less, greenhouse, gases, are, emitted, smart, cities, use, innovative, methods, of, design, and, implementation, in, various, sectors, of, infrastructure, and, planning, to, create, communities, that, operate, at, a, higher, level, of, relative, sustainability, than, their, traditional, counterparts, in, a, sustainable, city, urban, resilience, as, well, as, infrastructure, reliability, must, both, be, present, urban, resilience, is, defined, by, a, city, s, capacity, to, quickly, adapt, or, recover, from, infrastructure, defects, and, infrastructure, reliability, means, that, systems, must, work, efficiently, while, continuing, to, maximize, their, output, when, urban, resilience, and, infrastructure, reliability, interact, cities, are, able, to, produce, the, same, level, of, output, at, similarly, reasonable, costs, as, compared, to, other, non, sustainable, communities, while, still, maintaining, ease, of, operation, and, usage, masdar, city, is, a, proposed, zero, emission, smart, city, that, will, be, contracted, in, the, united, arab, emirates, some, individuals, have, referred, to, this, planned, settlement, as, utopia, like, due, to, the, fact, that, it, will, feature, multiple, sustainable, infrastructure, elements, including, energy, water, waste, management, and, transportation, masdar, city, will, have, a, power, infrastructure, containing, renewable, energy, methods, including, solar, energy, masdar, city, is, located, in, a, desert, region, meaning, that, sustainable, collection, and, distribution, of, water, is, dependent, on, the, city, s, ability, to, use, water, at, innovative, stages, of, the, water, cycle, the, city, will, use, groundwater, greywater, seawater, blackwater, and, other, water, resources, to, obtain, both, drinking, and, landscaping, water, initially, masdar, city, will, be, waste, free, recycling, and, other, waste, management, and, waste, reduction, methods, will, be, encouraged, additionally, the, city, will, implement, a, system, to, convert, waste, into, fertilizer, which, will, decrease, the, amount, of, space, needed, for, waste, accumulation, as, well, as, provide, an, environmentally, friendly, alternative, to, traditional, fertilizer, production, methods, no, cars, will, be, allowed, in, masdar, city, contributing, to, low, carbon, emissions, within, the, city, boundaries, instead, alternative, transportation, options, will, be, prioritized, during, infrastructure, development, this, means, that, a, bike, lane, network, will, be, accessible, and, comprehensive, and, other, options, will, also, be, available
