a, fixed, wing, aircraft, is, a, heavier, than, air, aircraft, such, as, an, airplane, which, is, capable, of, flight, using, aerodynamic, lift, fixed, wing, aircraft, are, distinct, from, rotary, wing, aircraft, in, which, a, rotor, mounted, on, a, spinning, shaft, generates, lift, and, ornithopters, in, which, the, wings, oscillate, to, generate, lift, the, wings, of, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, are, not, necessarily, rigid, kites, hang, gliders, variable, sweep, wing, aircraft, and, airplanes, that, use, wing, morphing, are, all, classified, as, fixed, wing, gliding, fixed, wing, aircraft, including, free, flying, gliders, and, tethered, kites, can, use, moving, air, to, gain, altitude, powered, fixed, wing, aircraft, airplanes, that, gain, forward, thrust, from, an, engine, include, powered, paragliders, powered, hang, gliders, and, ground, effect, vehicles, most, fixed, wing, aircraft, are, operated, by, a, pilot, but, some, are, unmanned, and, controlled, either, remotely, or, autonomously, kites, were, used, approximately, 2, 800, years, ago, in, china, where, kite, building, materials, were, available, leaf, kites, may, have, been, flown, earlier, in, what, is, now, sulawesi, based, on, their, interpretation, of, cave, paintings, on, nearby, muna, island, by, at, least, 549, ad, paper, kites, were, flying, as, recorded, that, year, a, paper, kite, was, used, as, a, message, for, a, rescue, mission, ancient, and, medieval, chinese, sources, report, kites, used, for, measuring, distances, testing, the, wind, lifting, men, signaling, and, communication, for, military, operations, kite, stories, were, brought, to, europe, by, marco, polo, towards, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, and, kites, were, brought, back, by, sailors, from, japan, and, malaysia, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, although, initially, regarded, as, curiosities, by, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, kites, were, used, for, scientific, research, around, 400, bc, in, greece, archytas, was, reputed, to, have, designed, and, built, the, first, self, propelled, flying, device, shaped, like, a, bird, and, propelled, by, a, jet, of, what, was, probably, steam, said, to, have, flown, some, 200, m, 660, ft, this, machine, may, have, been, suspended, during, its, flight, one, of, the, earliest, attempts, with, gliders, was, by, 11th, century, monk, eilmer, of, malmesbury, which, failed, a, 17th, century, account, states, that, 9th, century, poet, abbas, ibn, firnas, made, a, similar, attempt, though, no, earlier, sources, record, this, event, in, 1799, sir, george, cayley, laid, out, the, concept, of, the, modern, airplane, as, a, fixed, wing, machine, with, systems, for, lift, propulsion, and, control, cayley, was, building, and, flying, models, of, fixed, wing, aircraft, as, early, as, 1803, and, built, a, successful, passenger, carrying, glider, in, 1853, in, 1856, frenchman, jean, marie, le, bris, made, the, first, powered, flight, had, his, glider, l, albatros, artificiel, towed, by, a, horse, along, a, beach, in, 1884, american, john, j, montgomery, made, controlled, flights, in, a, glider, as, a, part, of, a, series, of, gliders, he, built, between, 1883, and, 1886, other, aviators, who, made, similar, flights, at, that, time, were, otto, lilienthal, percy, pilcher, and, prot, g, s, of, octave, chanute, in, the, 1890s, lawrence, hargrave, conducted, research, on, wing, structures, and, developed, a, box, kite, that, lifted, the, weight, of, a, man, his, designs, were, widely, adopted, he, also, developed, a, type, of, rotary, aircraft, engine, but, did, not, create, a, powered, fixed, wing, aircraft, sir, hiram, maxim, built, a, craft, that, weighed, 3, 5, tons, with, a, 110, foot, 34, meter, wingspan, powered, by, two, 360, horsepower, 270, kw, steam, engines, driving, two, propellers, in, 1894, his, machine, was, tested, with, overhead, rails, to, prevent, it, from, rising, the, test, showed, that, it, had, enough, lift, to, take, off, the, craft, was, uncontrollable, and, maxim, abandoned, work, on, it, the, wright, brothers, flights, in, 1903, with, their, flyer, i, are, recognized, by, the, f, d, ration, a, ronautique, internationale, fai, the, standard, setting, and, record, keeping, body, for, aeronautics, as, the, first, sustained, and, controlled, heavier, than, air, powered, flight, by, 1905, the, wright, flyer, iii, was, capable, of, fully, controllable, stable, flight, for, substantial, periods, in, 1906, brazilian, inventor, alberto, santos, dumont, designed, built, and, piloted, an, aircraft, that, set, the, first, world, record, recognized, by, the, a, ro, club, de, france, by, flying, the, 14, bis, 220, metres, 720, ft, in, less, than, 22, seconds, the, flight, was, certified, by, the, fai, the, bleriot, viii, design, of, 1908, was, an, early, aircraft, design, that, had, the, modern, monoplane, tractor, configuration, it, had, movable, tail, surfaces, controlling, both, yaw, and, pitch, a, form, of, roll, control, supplied, either, by, wing, warping, or, by, ailerons, and, controlled, by, its, pilot, with, a, joystick, and, rudder, bar, it, was, an, important, predecessor, of, his, later, bleriot, xi, channel, crossing, aircraft, of, the, summer, of, 1909, world, war, i, served, initiated, the, use, of, aircraft, as, weapons, and, observation, platforms, the, earliest, known, aerial, victory, with, a, synchronized, machine, gun, armed, fighter, aircraft, occurred, in, 1915, flown, by, german, luftstreitkr, fte, lieutenant, kurt, wintgens, fighter, aces, appeared, the, greatest, by, number, of, air, victories, was, manfred, von, richthofen, alcock, and, brown, crossed, the, atlantic, non, stop, for, the, first, time, in, 1919, the, first, commercial, flights, traveled, between, the, united, states, and, canada, in, 1919, the, so, called, golden, age, of, aviation, occurred, between, the, two, world, wars, during, which, updated, interpretations, of, earlier, breakthroughs, innovations, include, hugo, junkers, all, metal, air, frames, in, 1915, leading, to, multi, engine, aircraft, of, up, to, 60, meter, wingspan, sizes, by, the, early, 1930s, adoption, of, the, mostly, air, cooled, radial, engine, as, a, practical, aircraft, power, plant, alongside, v, 12, liquid, cooled, aviation, engines, and, longer, and, longer, flights, as, with, a, vickers, vimy, in, 1919, followed, months, later, by, the, u, s, navy, s, nc, 4, transatlantic, flight, culminating, in, may, 1927, with, charles, lindbergh, s, solo, trans, atlantic, flight, in, the, spirit, of, st, louis, spurring, ever, longer, flight, attempts, airplanes, had, a, presence, in, the, major, battles, of, world, war, ii, they, were, an, essential, component, of, military, strategies, such, as, the, german, blitzkrieg, or, the, american, and, japanese, aircraft, carrier, campaigns, of, the, pacific, military, gliders, were, developed, and, used, in, several, campaigns, but, were, limited, by, the, high, casualty, rate, encountered, the, focke, achgelis, fa, 330, bachstelze, wagtail, rotor, kite, of, 1942, was, notable, for, its, use, by, german, u, boats, before, and, during, the, war, british, and, german, designers, worked, on, jet, engines, the, first, jet, aircraft, to, fly, in, 1939, was, the, german, heinkel, he, 178, in, 1943, the, first, operational, jet, fighter, the, messerschmitt, me, 262, went, into, service, with, the, german, luftwaffe, later, in, the, war, the, british, gloster, meteor, entered, service, but, never, saw, action, top, air, speeds, for, that, era, went, as, high, as, 1, 130, km, h, 700, mph, with, the, early, july, 1944, unofficial, record, flight, of, the, german, me, 163b, v18, rocket, fighter, prototype, in, october, 1947, the, bell, x, 1, was, the, first, aircraft, to, exceed, the, speed, of, sound, flown, by, chuck, yeager, in, 1948, 49, aircraft, transported, supplies, during, the, berlin, blockade, new, aircraft, types, such, as, the, b, 52, were, produced, during, the, cold, war, the, first, jet, airliner, the, de, havilland, comet, was, introduced, in, 1952, followed, by, the, soviet, tupolev, tu, 104, in, 1956, the, boeing, 707, the, first, widely, successful, commercial, jet, was, in, commercial, service, for, more, than, 50, years, from, 1958, to, 2010, the, boeing, 747, was, the, world, s, biggest, passenger, aircraft, from, 1970, until, it, was, surpassed, by, the, airbus, a380, in, 2005, the, most, successful, aircraft, is, the, douglas, dc, 3, a, medium, twin, engine, passenger, aircraft, that, has, been, in, service, since, 1936, and, is, still, used, for, skydiving, and, other, recreational, flights, some, of, the, thousands, of, versions, found, other, purposes, like, the, ac, 47, a, vietnam, war, era, gunship, which, is, still, used, in, some, militaries, an, airplane, aeroplane, or, plane, is, a, powered, fixed, wing, aircraft, propelled, by, thrust, from, a, jet, engine, or, propeller, planes, come, in, many, sizes, shapes, and, wing, configurations, uses, include, recreation, transportation, of, goods, and, people, military, and, research, a, seaplane, hydroplane, is, capable, of, taking, off, and, landing, alighting, on, water, seaplanes, that, can, also, operate, from, dry, land, are, a, subclass, called, amphibian, aircraft, seaplanes, and, amphibians, divide, into, two, categories, float, planes, and, flying, boats, many, forms, of, glider, may, include, a, small, power, plant, these, include, a, ground, effect, vehicle, gev, flies, close, to, the, terrain, making, use, of, the, ground, effect, the, interaction, between, the, wings, and, the, surface, some, gevs, are, able, to, fly, higher, out, of, ground, effect, oge, when, required, these, are, classed, as, powered, fixed, wing, aircraft, a, glider, is, a, heavier, than, air, craft, whose, free, flight, does, not, require, an, engine, a, sailplane, is, a, fixed, wing, glider, designed, for, soaring, gaining, height, using, updrafts, of, air, and, to, fly, for, long, periods, gliders, are, mainly, used, for, recreation, but, have, found, use, for, purposes, such, as, aerodynamics, research, warfare, and, spacecraft, recovery, motor, gliders, are, equipped, with, a, limited, propulsion, system, for, takeoff, or, to, extend, flight, duration, as, is, the, case, with, planes, gliders, come, in, diverse, forms, with, varied, wings, aerodynamic, efficiency, pilot, location, and, controls, large, gliders, are, most, commonly, born, aloft, by, a, tow, plane, or, by, a, winch, military, gliders, have, been, used, in, combat, to, deliver, troops, and, equipment, while, specialized, gliders, have, been, used, in, atmospheric, and, aerodynamic, research, rocket, powered, aircraft, and, spaceplanes, have, made, unpowered, landings, similar, to, a, glider, gliders, and, sailplanes, that, are, used, for, the, sport, of, gliding, have, high, aerodynamic, efficiency, the, highest, lift, to, drag, ratio, is, 70, 1, though, 50, 1, is, common, after, take, off, further, altitude, can, be, gained, through, the, skillful, exploitation, of, rising, air, flights, of, thousands, of, kilometers, at, average, speeds, over, 200, km, h, have, been, achieved, one, small, scale, example, of, a, glider, is, the, paper, airplane, an, ordinary, sheet, of, paper, can, be, folded, into, an, aerodynamic, shape, fairly, easily, its, low, mass, relative, to, its, surface, area, reduces, the, required, lift, for, flight, allowing, it, to, glide, some, distance, gliders, and, sailplanes, share, many, design, elements, and, aerodynamic, principles, with, powered, aircraft, for, example, the, horten, h, iv, was, a, tailless, flying, wing, glider, and, the, delta, winged, space, shuttle, orbiter, glided, during, its, descent, phase, many, gliders, adopt, similar, control, surfaces, and, instruments, as, airplanes, the, main, application, of, modern, glider, aircraft, is, sport, and, recreation, gliders, were, developed, in, the, 1920s, for, recreational, purposes, as, pilots, began, to, understand, how, to, use, rising, air, sailplane, gliders, were, developed, with, a, high, lift, to, drag, ratio, these, allowed, the, craft, to, glide, to, the, next, source, of, lift, increasing, their, range, this, gave, rise, to, the, popular, sport, of, gliding, early, gliders, were, built, mainly, of, wood, and, metal, later, replaced, by, composite, materials, incorporating, glass, carbon, or, aramid, fibers, to, minimize, drag, these, types, have, a, streamlined, fuselage, and, long, narrow, wings, incorporating, a, high, aspect, ratio, single, seat, and, two, seat, gliders, are, available, initially, training, was, done, by, short, hops, in, primary, gliders, which, have, no, cockpit, and, minimal, instruments, since, shortly, after, world, war, ii, training, is, done, in, two, seat, dual, control, gliders, but, high, performance, two, seaters, can, make, long, flights, originally, skids, were, used, for, landing, later, replaced, by, wheels, often, retractable, gliders, known, as, motor, gliders, are, designed, for, unpowered, flight, but, can, deploy, piston, rotary, jet, or, electric, engines, gliders, are, classified, by, the, fai, for, competitions, into, glider, competition, classes, mainly, on, the, basis, of, wingspan, and, flaps, a, class, of, ultralight, sailplanes, including, some, known, as, microlift, gliders, and, some, known, as, airchairs, has, been, defined, by, the, fai, based, on, weight, they, are, light, enough, to, be, transported, easily, and, can, be, flown, without, licensing, in, some, countries, ultralight, gliders, have, performance, similar, to, hang, gliders, but, offer, some, crash, safety, as, the, pilot, can, strap, into, an, upright, seat, within, a, deform, able, structure, landing, is, usually, on, one, or, two, wheels, which, distinguishes, these, craft, from, hang, gliders, most, are, built, by, individual, designers, and, hobbyists, military, gliders, were, used, during, world, war, ii, for, carrying, troops, glider, infantry, and, heavy, equipment, to, combat, zones, the, gliders, were, towed, into, the, air, and, most, of, the, way, to, their, target, by, transport, planes, e, g, c, 47, dakota, or, by, one, time, bombers, that, had, been, relegated, to, secondary, activities, e, g, short, stirling, the, advantage, over, paratroopers, were, that, heavy, equipment, could, be, landed, and, that, troops, were, quickly, assembled, rather, than, dispersed, over, a, parachute, drop, zone, the, gliders, were, treated, as, disposable, constructed, from, inexpensive, materials, such, as, wood, though, a, few, were, re, used, by, the, time, of, the, korean, war, transport, aircraft, had, become, larger, and, more, efficient, so, that, even, light, tanks, could, be, dropped, by, parachute, obsoleting, gliders, even, after, the, development, of, powered, aircraft, gliders, continued, to, be, used, for, aviation, research, the, nasa, paresev, rogallo, flexible, wing, was, developed, to, investigate, alternative, methods, of, recovering, spacecraft, although, this, application, was, abandoned, publicity, inspired, hobbyists, to, adapt, the, flexible, wing, airfoil, for, hang, gliders, initial, research, into, many, types, of, fixed, wing, craft, including, flying, wings, and, lifting, bodies, was, also, carried, out, using, unpowered, prototypes, a, hang, glider, is, a, glider, aircraft, in, which, the, pilot, is, suspended, in, a, harness, suspended, from, the, air, frame, and, exercises, control, by, shifting, body, weight, in, opposition, to, a, control, frame, hang, gliders, are, typically, made, of, an, aluminum, alloy, or, composite, framed, fabric, wing, pilots, can, soar, for, hours, gain, thousands, of, meters, of, altitude, in, thermal, updrafts, perform, aerobatics, and, glide, cross, country, for, hundreds, of, kilometers, a, paraglider, is, a, lightweight, free, flying, foot, launched, glider, with, no, rigid, body, the, pilot, is, suspended, in, a, harness, below, a, hollow, fabric, wing, whose, shape, is, formed, by, its, suspension, lines, air, entering, vents, in, the, front, of, the, wing, and, the, aerodynamic, forces, of, the, air, flowing, over, the, outside, power, the, craft, paragliding, is, most, often, a, recreational, activity, a, paper, plane, is, a, toy, aircraft, usually, a, glider, made, out, of, paper, or, paperboard, model, glider, aircraft, are, models, of, aircraft, using, lightweight, materials, such, as, polystyrene, and, balsa, wood, designs, range, from, simple, glider, aircraft, to, accurate, scale, models, some, of, which, can, be, very, large, glide, bombs, are, bombs, with, aerodynamic, surfaces, to, allow, a, gliding, flight, path, rather, than, a, ballistic, one, this, enables, stand, off, aircraft, to, attack, a, target, from, a, distance, a, kite, is, a, tethered, aircraft, held, aloft, by, wind, that, blows, over, its, wing, s, high, pressure, below, the, wing, deflects, the, airflow, downwards, this, deflection, generates, horizontal, drag, in, the, direction, of, the, wind, the, resultant, force, vector, from, the, lift, and, drag, force, components, is, opposed, by, the, tension, of, the, tether, kites, are, mostly, flown, for, recreational, purposes, but, have, many, other, uses, early, pioneers, such, as, the, wright, brothers, and, j, w, dunne, sometimes, flew, an, aircraft, as, a, kite, in, order, to, confirm, its, flight, characteristics, before, adding, an, engine, and, flight, controls, kites, have, been, used, for, signaling, for, delivery, of, munitions, and, for, observation, by, lifting, an, observer, above, the, field, of, battle, and, by, using, kite, aerial, photography, kites, have, been, used, for, scientific, purposes, such, as, benjamin, franklin, s, famous, experiment, proving, that, lightning, is, electricity, kites, were, the, precursors, to, the, traditional, aircraft, and, were, instrumental, in, the, development, of, early, flying, craft, alexander, graham, bell, experimented, with, large, man, lifting, kites, as, did, the, wright, brothers, and, lawrence, hargrave, kites, had, a, historical, role, in, lifting, scientific, instruments, to, measure, atmospheric, conditions, for, weather, forecasting, kites, can, be, used, to, carry, radio, antennas, this, method, was, used, for, the, reception, station, of, the, first, transatlantic, transmission, by, marconi, captive, balloons, may, be, more, convenient, for, such, experiments, because, kite, carried, antennas, require, strong, wind, which, may, be, not, always, available, with, heavy, equipment, and, a, ground, conductor, kites, can, be, used, to, carry, light, sources, such, as, light, sticks, or, battery, powered, lights, kites, can, be, used, to, pull, people, and, vehicles, downwind, efficient, foil, type, kites, such, as, power, kites, can, also, be, used, to, sail, upwind, under, the, same, principles, as, used, by, other, sailing, craft, provided, that, lateral, forces, on, the, ground, or, in, the, water, are, redirected, as, with, the, keels, center, boards, wheels, and, ice, blades, of, traditional, sailing, craft, in, the, last, two, decades, kite, sailing, sports, have, become, popular, such, as, kite, buggying, kite, landboarding, kite, boating, and, kite, surfing, snow, kiting, is, also, popular, kite, sailing, opens, several, possibilities, not, available, in, traditional, sailing, research, and, development, projects, investigate, kites, for, harnessing, high, altitude, wind, currents, for, electricity, generation, kite, festivals, are, a, popular, form, of, entertainment, throughout, the, world, they, include, local, events, traditional, festivals, and, major, international, festivals, the, structural, element, of, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, is, the, air, frame, it, varies, according, to, the, aircraft, s, type, purpose, and, technology, early, airframes, were, made, of, wood, with, fabric, wing, surfaces, when, engines, became, available, for, powered, flight, their, mounts, were, made, of, metal, as, speeds, increased, metal, became, more, common, until, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, all, metal, and, glass, aircraft, were, common, in, modern, times, composite, materials, became, more, common, typical, structural, elements, include, the, wings, of, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, are, static, planes, extending, to, either, side, of, the, aircraft, when, the, aircraft, travels, forwards, air, flows, over, the, wings, that, are, shaped, to, create, lift, kites, and, some, lightweight, gliders, and, airplanes, have, flexible, wing, surfaces, that, are, stretched, across, a, frame, and, made, rigid, by, the, lift, forces, exerted, by, the, airflow, over, them, larger, aircraft, have, rigid, wing, surfaces, whether, flexible, or, rigid, most, wings, have, a, strong, frame, to, give, them, shape, and, to, transfer, lift, from, the, wing, surface, to, the, rest, of, the, aircraft, the, main, structural, elements, are, one, or, more, spars, running, from, root, to, tip, and, ribs, running, from, the, leading, front, to, the, trailing, rear, edge, early, airplane, engines, had, little, power, and, light, weight, was, critical, also, early, airfoil, sections, were, thin, and, could, not, support, a, strong, frame, until, the, 1930s, most, wings, were, so, fragile, that, external, bracing, struts, and, wires, were, added, as, engine, power, increased, wings, could, be, made, heavy, and, strong, enough, that, bracing, was, unnecessary, such, an, unbraced, wing, is, called, a, cantilever, wing, the, number, and, shape, of, wings, vary, widely, some, designs, blend, the, wing, with, the, fuselage, while, left, and, right, wings, separated, by, the, fuselage, are, more, common, occasionally, more, wings, have, been, used, such, as, the, three, winged, triplane, from, world, war, i, four, winged, quadruplanes, and, other, multiplane, designs, have, had, little, success, most, planes, are, monoplanes, with, one, or, two, parallel, wings, biplanes, and, triplanes, stack, one, wing, above, the, other, tandem, wings, place, one, wing, behind, the, other, possibly, joined, at, the, tips, when, the, available, engine, power, increased, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, and, bracing, was, no, longer, needed, the, unbraced, or, cantilever, monoplane, became, the, most, common, form, the, planform, is, the, shape, when, seen, from, above, below, to, be, aerodynamically, efficient, wings, are, straight, with, a, long, span, but, a, short, chord, high, aspect, ratio, to, be, structurally, efficient, and, hence, lightweight, wingspan, must, be, as, small, as, possible, but, offer, enough, area, to, provide, lift, to, travel, at, transonic, speeds, variable, geometry, wings, change, orientation, angling, backward, to, reduce, drag, from, supersonic, shock, waves, the, variable, sweep, wing, transforms, between, an, efficient, straight, configuration, for, takeoff, and, landing, to, a, low, drag, swept, configuration, for, high, speed, flight, other, forms, of, variable, planform, have, been, flown, but, none, have, gone, beyond, the, research, stage, the, swept, wing, is, a, straight, wing, swept, backward, or, forwards, the, delta, wing, is, a, triangular, shape, that, serves, various, purposes, as, a, flexible, rogallo, wing, it, allows, a, stable, shape, under, aerodynamic, forces, and, is, often, used, for, kites, and, other, ultralight, craft, it, is, supersonic, capable, combining, high, strength, with, low, drag, wings, are, typically, hollow, also, serving, as, fuel, tanks, they, are, equipped, with, flaps, which, allow, the, wing, to, increase, decrease, drag, lift, for, take, off, and, landing, and, acting, in, opposition, to, change, direction, the, fuselage, is, typically, long, and, thin, usually, with, tapered, or, rounded, ends, to, make, its, shape, aerodynamically, smooth, most, fixed, wing, aircraft, have, a, single, fuselage, others, may, have, multiple, fuselages, or, the, fuselage, may, be, fitted, with, booms, on, either, side, of, the, tail, to, allow, the, extreme, rear, of, the, fuselage, to, be, utilized, the, fuselage, typically, carries, the, flight, crew, passengers, cargo, and, sometimes, fuel, and, engine, s, gliders, typically, omit, fuel, andengines, although, some, variations, such, as, motor, gliders, and, rocket, gliders, have, them, for, temporary, or, optional, use, pilots, of, manned, commercial, fixed, wing, aircraft, control, them, from, inside, a, cockpit, within, the, fuselage, typically, located, at, the, front, top, equipped, with, controls, windows, and, instruments, separated, from, passengers, by, a, secure, door, in, small, aircraft, the, passengers, typically, sit, behind, the, pilot, s, in, the, cabin, occasionally, a, passenger, may, sit, beside, or, in, front, of, the, pilot, larger, passenger, aircraft, have, a, separate, passenger, cabin, or, occasionally, cabins, that, are, physically, separated, from, the, cockpit, aircraft, often, have, two, or, more, pilots, with, one, in, overall, command, the, pilot, and, one, or, more, co, pilots, on, larger, aircraft, a, navigator, is, typically, also, seated, in, the, cockpit, as, well, some, military, or, specialized, aircraft, may, have, other, flight, crew, members, in, the, cockpit, as, well, a, flying, wing, is, a, tailless, aircraft, that, has, no, distinct, fuselage, housing, the, crew, payload, and, equipment, inside, 224, the, flying, wing, configuration, was, studied, extensively, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, notably, by, jack, northrop, and, cheston, l, eshelman, in, the, united, states, and, alexander, lippisch, and, the, horten, brothers, in, germany, after, the, war, numerous, experimental, designs, were, based, on, the, flying, wing, concept, general, interest, continued, into, the, 1950s, but, designs, did, not, offer, a, great, advantage, in, range, and, presented, technical, problems, the, flying, wing, is, most, practical, for, designs, in, the, slow, to, medium, speed, range, and, drew, continual, interest, as, a, tactical, airlifter, design, interest, in, flying, wings, reemerged, in, the, 1980s, due, to, their, potentially, low, radar, cross, sections, stealth, technology, relies, on, shapes, that, reflect, radar, waves, only, in, certain, directions, thus, making, it, harder, to, detect, this, approach, eventually, led, to, the, northrop, b, 2, spirit, stealth, bomber, pictured, the, flying, wing, s, aerodynamics, are, not, the, primary, concern, computer, controlled, fly, by, wire, systems, compensated, for, many, of, the, aerodynamic, drawbacks, enabling, an, efficient, and, stable, long, range, aircraft, blended, wing, body, aircraft, have, a, flattened, airfoil, shaped, body, which, produces, most, of, the, lift, to, keep, itself, aloft, and, distinct, and, separate, wing, structures, though, the, wings, are, blended, with, the, body, blended, wing, bodied, aircraft, incorporate, design, features, from, both, fuselage, and, flying, wing, designs, the, purported, advantages, of, the, blended, wing, body, approach, are, efficient, high, lift, wings, and, a, wide, airfoil, shaped, body, this, enables, the, entire, craft, to, contribute, to, lift, generation, with, potentially, increased, fuel, economy, a, lifting, body, is, a, configuration, in, which, the, body, produces, lift, in, contrast, to, a, flying, wing, which, is, a, wing, with, minimal, or, no, conventional, fuselage, a, lifting, body, can, be, thought, of, as, a, fuselage, with, little, or, no, conventional, wing, whereas, a, flying, wing, seeks, to, maximize, cruise, efficiency, at, subsonic, speeds, by, eliminating, non, lifting, surfaces, lifting, bodies, generally, minimize, the, drag, and, structure, of, a, wing, for, subsonic, supersonic, and, hypersonic, flight, or, spacecraft, re, entry, all, of, these, flight, regimes, pose, challenges, for, flight, stability, lifting, bodies, were, a, major, area, of, research, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, as, a, means, to, build, small, and, lightweight, manned, spacecraft, the, us, built, lifting, body, rocket, planes, to, test, the, concept, as, well, as, several, rocket, launched, re, entry, vehicles, interest, waned, as, the, us, air, force, lost, interest, in, the, manned, mission, and, major, development, ended, during, the, space, shuttle, design, process, when, it, became, clear, that, highly, shaped, fuselages, made, it, difficult, to, fit, fuel, tanks, the, classic, airfoil, section, wing, is, unstable, in, flight, flexible, wing, planes, often, rely, on, an, anchor, line, or, the, weight, of, a, pilot, hanging, beneath, to, maintain, the, correct, attitude, some, free, flying, types, use, an, adapted, airfoil, that, is, stable, or, other, mechanisms, including, electronic, artificial, stability, in, order, to, achieve, trim, stability, and, control, most, fixed, wing, types, have, an, empennage, comprising, a, fin, and, rudder, that, act, horizontally, and, a, tailplane, and, elevator, that, act, vertically, this, is, so, common, that, it, is, known, as, the, conventional, layout, sometimes, two, or, more, fins, are, spaced, out, along, the, tailplane, some, types, have, a, horizontal, canard, foreplane, ahead, of, the, main, wing, instead, of, behind, it, 86, this, foreplane, may, contribute, to, the, trim, stability, or, control, of, the, aircraft, or, to, several, of, these, kites, are, controlled, by, one, or, more, tethers, gliders, and, airplanes, have, sophisticated, control, systems, especially, if, they, are, piloted, the, controls, allow, the, pilot, to, direct, the, aircraft, in, the, air, and, on, the, ground, typically, these, are, other, common, controls, include, a, craft, may, have, two, pilot, seats, with, dual, controls, allowing, two, to, take, turns, the, control, system, may, allow, full, or, partial, automation, such, as, an, autopilot, a, wing, leveler, or, a, flight, management, system, an, unmanned, aircraft, has, no, pilot, and, is, controlled, remotely, or, via, gyroscopes, computers, sensors, or, other, forms, of, autonomous, control, on, manned, fixed, wing, aircraft, instruments, provide, information, to, the, pilots, including, flight, engines, navigation, communications, and, other, aircraft, systems, that, may, be, installed, the, six, basic, instruments, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, six, pack, are, other, cockpit, instruments, include, some, or, all, of, these, instruments, may, appear, on, a, computer, display, and, be, operated, with, touches, ala, a, phone
