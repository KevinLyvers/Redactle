a, compass, is, a, device, that, shows, the, cardinal, directions, used, for, navigation, and, geographic, orientation, it, commonly, consists, of, a, magnetized, needle, or, other, element, such, as, a, compass, card, or, compass, rose, which, can, pivot, to, align, itself, with, magnetic, north, other, methods, may, be, used, including, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and, gps, receivers, compasses, often, show, angles, in, degrees, north, corresponds, to, 0, and, the, angles, increase, clockwise, so, east, is, 90, south, is, 180, and, west, is, 270, these, numbers, allow, the, compass, to, show, azimuths, or, bearings, which, are, commonly, stated, in, degrees, if, local, variation, between, magnetic, north, and, true, north, is, known, then, direction, of, magnetic, north, also, gives, direction, of, true, north, among, the, four, great, inventions, the, magnetic, compass, was, first, invented, as, a, device, for, divination, as, early, as, the, chinese, han, dynasty, since, c, 206, bc, and, later, adopted, for, navigation, by, the, song, dynasty, chinese, during, the, 11th, century, the, first, usage, of, a, compass, recorded, in, western, europe, and, the, islamic, world, occurred, around, 1190, the, magnetic, compass, is, the, most, familiar, compass, type, it, functions, as, a, pointer, to, magnetic, north, the, local, magnetic, meridian, because, the, magnetized, needle, at, its, heart, aligns, itself, with, the, horizontal, component, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, the, magnetic, field, exerts, a, torque, on, the, needle, pulling, the, north, end, or, pole, of, the, needle, approximately, toward, the, earth, s, north, magnetic, pole, and, pulling, the, other, toward, the, earth, s, south, magnetic, pole, the, needle, is, mounted, on, a, low, friction, pivot, point, in, better, compasses, a, jewel, bearing, so, it, can, turn, easily, when, the, compass, is, held, level, the, needle, turns, until, after, a, few, seconds, to, allow, oscillations, to, die, out, it, settles, into, its, equilibrium, orientation, in, navigation, directions, on, maps, are, usually, expressed, with, reference, to, geographical, or, true, north, the, direction, toward, the, geographical, north, pole, the, rotation, axis, of, the, earth, depending, on, where, the, compass, is, located, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, angle, between, true, north, and, magnetic, north, called, magnetic, declination, can, vary, widely, with, geographic, location, the, local, magnetic, declination, is, given, on, most, maps, to, allow, the, map, to, be, oriented, with, a, compass, parallel, to, true, north, the, locations, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, poles, slowly, change, with, time, which, is, referred, to, as, geomagnetic, secular, variation, the, effect, of, this, means, a, map, with, the, latest, declination, information, should, be, used, some, magnetic, compasses, include, means, to, manually, compensate, for, the, magnetic, declination, so, that, the, compass, shows, true, directions, the, first, compasses, in, ancient, han, dynasty, china, were, made, of, lodestone, a, naturally, magnetized, ore, of, iron, the, wet, compass, reached, southern, india, in, the, 4th, century, ad, later, compasses, were, made, of, iron, needles, magnetized, by, striking, them, with, a, lodestone, which, appeared, in, china, by, 1088, during, the, song, dynasty, as, described, by, shen, kuo, dry, compasses, began, to, appear, around, 1300, in, medieval, europe, and, the, islamic, world, this, was, supplanted, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, the, liquid, filled, magnetic, compass, modern, compasses, usually, use, a, magnetized, needle, or, dial, inside, a, capsule, completely, filled, with, a, liquid, lamp, oil, mineral, oil, white, spirits, purified, kerosene, or, ethyl, alcohol, are, common, while, older, designs, commonly, incorporated, a, flexible, rubber, diaphragm, or, airspace, inside, the, capsule, to, allow, for, volume, changes, caused, by, temperature, or, altitude, some, modern, liquid, compasses, use, smaller, housings, and, or, flexible, capsule, materials, to, accomplish, the, same, result, the, liquid, inside, the, capsule, serves, to, damp, the, movement, of, the, needle, reducing, oscillation, time, and, increasing, stability, key, points, on, the, compass, including, the, north, end, of, the, needle, are, often, marked, with, phosphorescent, photoluminescent, or, self, luminous, materials, to, enable, the, compass, to, be, read, at, night, or, in, poor, light, as, the, compass, fill, liquid, is, noncompressible, under, pressure, many, ordinary, liquid, filled, compasses, will, operate, accurately, underwater, to, considerable, depths, many, modern, compasses, incorporate, a, baseplate, and, protractor, tool, and, are, referred, to, variously, as, orienteering, baseplate, map, compass, or, protractor, designs, this, type, of, compass, uses, a, separate, magnetized, needle, inside, a, rotating, capsule, an, orienting, box, or, gate, for, aligning, the, needle, with, magnetic, north, a, transparent, base, containing, map, orienting, lines, and, a, bezel, outer, dial, marked, in, degrees, or, other, units, of, angular, measurement, the, capsule, is, mounted, in, a, transparent, baseplate, containing, a, direction, of, travel, dot, indicator, for, use, in, taking, bearings, directly, from, a, map, other, features, found, on, modern, orienteering, compasses, are, map, and, romer, scales, for, measuring, distances, and, plotting, positions, on, maps, luminous, markings, on, the, face, or, bezels, various, sighting, mechanisms, mirror, prism, etc, for, taking, bearings, of, distant, objects, with, greater, precision, gimbal, mounted, global, needles, for, use, in, differing, hemispheres, special, rare, earth, magnets, to, stabilize, compass, needles, adjustable, declination, for, obtaining, instant, true, bearings, without, resorting, to, arithmetic, and, devices, such, as, inclinometers, for, measuring, gradients, the, sport, of, orienteering, has, also, resulted, in, the, development, of, models, with, extremely, fast, settling, and, stable, needles, utilizing, rare, earth, magnets, for, optimal, use, with, a, topographic, map, a, land, navigation, technique, known, as, terrain, association, many, marine, compasses, designed, for, use, on, boats, with, constantly, shifting, angles, use, dampening, fluids, such, as, isopar, m, or, isopar, l, to, limit, the, rapid, fluctuation, and, direction, of, the, needle, the, military, forces, of, a, few, nations, notably, the, united, states, army, continue, to, issue, field, compasses, with, magnetized, compass, dials, or, cards, instead, of, needles, a, magnetic, card, compass, is, usually, equipped, with, an, optical, lensatic, or, prismatic, sight, which, allows, the, user, to, read, the, bearing, or, azimuth, off, the, compass, card, while, simultaneously, aligning, the, compass, with, the, objective, see, photo, magnetic, card, compass, designs, normally, require, a, separate, protractor, tool, in, order, to, take, bearings, directly, from, a, map, the, u, s, m, 1950, military, lensatic, compass, does, not, use, a, liquid, filled, capsule, as, a, damping, mechanism, but, rather, electromagnetic, induction, to, control, oscillation, of, its, magnetized, card, a, deep, well, design, is, used, to, allow, the, compass, to, be, used, globally, with, a, card, tilt, of, up, to, 8, degrees, without, impairing, accuracy, as, induction, forces, provide, less, damping, than, fluid, filled, designs, a, needle, lock, is, fitted, to, the, compass, to, reduce, wear, operated, by, the, folding, action, of, the, rear, sight, lens, holder, the, use, of, air, filled, induction, compasses, has, declined, over, the, years, as, they, may, become, inoperative, or, inaccurate, in, freezing, temperatures, or, extremely, humid, environments, due, to, condensation, or, water, ingress, some, military, compasses, like, the, u, s, m, 1950, cammenga, 3h, military, lensatic, compass, the, silva, 4b, militaire, and, the, suunto, m, 5n, t, contain, the, radioactive, material, tritium, 3, 1, h, and, a, combination, of, phosphors, the, u, s, m, 1950, equipped, with, self, luminous, lighting, contains, 120, mci, millicuries, of, tritium, the, purpose, of, the, tritium, and, phosphors, is, to, provide, illumination, for, the, compass, via, radioluminescent, tritium, illumination, which, does, not, require, the, compass, to, be, recharged, by, sunlight, or, artificial, light, however, tritium, has, a, half, life, of, only, about, 12, years, so, a, compass, that, contains, 120, mci, of, tritium, when, new, will, contain, only, 60, when, it, is, 12, years, old, 30, when, it, is, 24, years, old, and, so, on, consequently, the, illumination, of, the, display, will, fade, mariners, compasses, can, have, two, or, more, magnets, permanently, attached, to, a, compass, card, which, moves, freely, on, a, pivot, a, lubber, line, which, can, be, a, marking, on, the, compass, bowl, or, a, small, fixed, needle, indicates, the, ship, s, heading, on, the, compass, card, traditionally, the, card, is, divided, into, thirty, two, points, known, as, rhumbs, although, modern, compasses, are, marked, in, degrees, rather, than, cardinal, points, the, glass, covered, box, or, bowl, contains, a, suspended, gimbal, within, a, binnacle, this, preserves, the, horizontal, position, the, magnetic, compass, is, very, reliable, at, moderate, latitudes, but, in, geographic, regions, near, the, earth, s, magnetic, poles, it, becomes, unusable, as, the, compass, is, moved, closer, to, one, of, the, magnetic, poles, the, magnetic, declination, the, difference, between, the, direction, to, geographical, north, and, magnetic, north, becomes, greater, and, greater, at, some, point, close, to, the, magnetic, pole, the, compass, will, not, indicate, any, particular, direction, but, will, begin, to, drift, also, the, needle, starts, to, point, up, or, down, when, getting, closer, to, the, poles, because, of, the, so, called, magnetic, inclination, cheap, compasses, with, bad, bearings, may, get, stuck, because, of, this, and, therefore, indicate, a, wrong, direction, magnetic, compasses, are, influenced, by, any, fields, other, than, earth, s, local, environments, may, contain, magnetic, mineral, deposits, and, artificial, sources, such, as, mris, large, iron, or, steel, bodies, electrical, engines, or, strong, permanent, magnets, any, electrically, conductive, body, produces, its, own, magnetic, field, when, it, is, carrying, an, electric, current, magnetic, compasses, are, prone, to, errors, in, the, neighborhood, of, such, bodies, some, compasses, include, magnets, which, can, be, adjusted, to, compensate, for, external, magnetic, fields, making, the, compass, more, reliable, and, accurate, a, compass, is, also, subject, to, errors, when, the, compass, is, accelerated, or, decelerated, in, an, airplane, or, automobile, depending, on, which, of, the, earth, s, hemispheres, the, compass, is, located, and, if, the, force, is, acceleration, or, deceleration, the, compass, will, increase, or, decrease, the, indicated, heading, compasses, that, include, compensating, magnets, are, especially, prone, to, these, errors, since, accelerations, tilt, the, needle, bringing, it, closer, or, further, from, the, magnets, another, error, of, the, mechanical, compass, is, the, turning, error, when, one, turns, from, a, heading, of, east, or, west, the, compass, will, lag, behind, the, turn, or, lead, ahead, of, the, turn, magnetometers, and, substitutes, such, as, gyrocompasses, are, more, stable, in, such, situations, a, thumb, compass, is, a, type, of, compass, commonly, used, in, orienteering, a, sport, in, which, map, reading, and, terrain, association, are, paramount, consequently, most, thumb, compasses, have, minimal, or, no, degree, markings, at, all, and, are, normally, used, only, to, orient, the, map, to, magnetic, north, an, oversized, rectangular, needle, or, north, indicator, aids, visibility, thumb, compasses, are, also, often, transparent, so, that, an, orienteer, can, hold, a, map, in, the, hand, with, the, compass, and, see, the, map, through, the, compass, the, best, models, use, rare, earth, magnets, to, reduce, needle, settling, time, to, 1, second, or, less, small, compasses, found, in, clocks, mobile, phones, and, other, electronic, devices, are, solid, state, microelectromechanical, systems, mems, compasses, usually, built, out, of, two, or, three, magnetic, field, sensors, that, provide, data, for, a, microprocessor, often, the, device, is, a, discrete, component, which, outputs, either, a, digital, or, analog, signal, proportional, to, its, orientation, this, signal, is, interpreted, by, a, controller, or, microprocessor, and, either, used, internally, or, sent, to, a, display, unit, the, sensor, uses, highly, calibrated, internal, electronics, to, measure, the, response, of, the, device, to, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, apart, from, navigational, compasses, other, specialty, compasses, have, also, been, designed, to, accommodate, specific, uses, these, include, a, magnetic, rod, is, required, when, constructing, a, compass, this, can, be, created, by, aligning, an, iron, or, steel, rod, with, earth, s, magnetic, field, and, then, tempering, or, striking, it, however, this, method, produces, only, a, weak, magnet, so, other, methods, are, preferred, for, example, a, magnetised, rod, can, be, created, by, repeatedly, rubbing, an, iron, rod, with, a, magnetic, lodestone, this, magnetised, rod, or, magnetic, needle, is, then, placed, on, a, low, friction, surface, to, allow, it, to, freely, pivot, to, align, itself, with, the, magnetic, field, it, is, then, labeled, so, the, user, can, distinguish, the, north, pointing, from, the, south, pointing, end, in, modern, convention, the, north, end, is, typically, marked, in, some, way, if, a, needle, is, rubbed, on, a, lodestone, or, other, magnet, the, needle, becomes, magnetized, when, it, is, inserted, in, a, cork, or, piece, of, wood, and, placed, in, a, bowl, of, water, it, becomes, a, compass, such, devices, were, universally, used, as, compasses, until, the, invention, of, the, box, like, compass, with, a, dry, pivoting, needle, sometime, around, 1300, originally, many, compasses, were, marked, only, as, to, the, direction, of, magnetic, north, or, to, the, four, cardinal, points, north, south, east, west, later, these, were, divided, in, china, into, 24, and, in, europe, into, 32, equally, spaced, points, around, the, compass, card, for, a, table, of, the, thirty, two, points, see, compass, points, in, the, modern, era, the, 360, degree, system, took, hold, this, system, is, still, in, use, today, for, civilian, navigators, the, degree, system, spaces, 360, equidistant, points, located, clockwise, around, the, compass, dial, in, the, 19th, century, some, european, nations, adopted, the, grad, also, called, grade, or, gon, system, instead, where, a, right, angle, is, 100, grads, to, give, a, circle, of, 400, grads, dividing, grads, into, tenths, to, give, a, circle, of, 4000, decigrades, has, also, been, used, in, armies, most, military, forces, have, adopted, the, french, millieme, system, this, is, an, approximation, of, a, milli, radian, 6283, per, circle, in, which, the, compass, dial, is, spaced, into, 6400, units, or, mils, for, additional, precision, when, measuring, angles, laying, artillery, etc, the, value, to, the, military, is, that, one, angular, mil, subtends, approximately, one, metre, at, a, distance, of, one, kilometer, imperial, russia, used, a, system, derived, by, dividing, the, circumference, of, a, circle, into, chords, of, the, same, length, as, the, radius, each, of, these, was, divided, into, 100, spaces, giving, a, circle, of, 600, the, soviet, union, divided, these, into, tenths, to, give, a, circle, of, 6000, units, usually, translated, as, mils, this, system, was, adopted, by, the, former, warsaw, pact, countries, e, g, the, soviet, union, east, germany, etc, often, counterclockwise, see, picture, of, wrist, compass, this, is, still, in, use, in, russia, because, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, s, inclination, and, intensity, vary, at, different, latitudes, compasses, are, often, balanced, during, manufacture, so, that, the, dial, or, needle, will, be, level, eliminating, needle, drag, most, manufacturers, balance, their, compass, needles, for, one, of, five, zones, ranging, from, zone, 1, covering, most, of, the, northern, hemisphere, to, zone, 5, covering, australia, and, the, southern, oceans, this, individual, zone, balancing, prevents, excessive, dipping, of, one, end, of, the, needle, which, can, cause, the, compass, card, to, stick, and, give, false, readings, some, compasses, feature, a, special, needle, balancing, system, that, will, accurately, indicate, magnetic, north, regardless, of, the, particular, magnetic, zone, other, magnetic, compasses, have, a, small, sliding, counterweight, installed, on, the, needle, this, sliding, counterweight, called, a, rider, can, be, used, for, counterbalancing, the, needle, against, the, dip, caused, by, inclination, if, the, compass, is, taken, to, a, zone, with, a, higher, or, lower, dip, like, any, magnetic, device, compasses, are, affected, by, nearby, ferrous, materials, as, well, as, by, strong, local, electromagnetic, forces, compasses, used, for, wilderness, land, navigation, should, not, be, used, in, proximity, to, ferrous, metal, objects, or, electromagnetic, fields, car, electrical, systems, automobile, engines, steel, pitons, etc, as, that, can, affect, their, accuracy, compasses, are, particularly, difficult, to, use, accurately, in, or, near, trucks, cars, or, other, mechanized, vehicles, even, when, corrected, for, deviation, by, the, use, of, built, in, magnets, or, other, devices, large, amounts, of, ferrous, metal, combined, with, the, on, and, off, electrical, fields, caused, by, the, vehicle, s, ignition, and, charging, systems, generally, result, in, significant, compass, errors, at, sea, a, ship, s, compass, must, also, be, corrected, for, errors, called, deviation, caused, by, iron, and, steel, in, its, structure, and, equipment, the, ship, is, swung, that, is, rotated, about, a, fixed, point, while, its, heading, is, noted, by, alignment, with, fixed, points, on, the, shore, a, compass, deviation, card, is, prepared, so, that, the, navigator, can, convert, between, compass, and, magnetic, headings, the, compass, can, be, corrected, in, three, ways, first, the, lubber, line, can, be, adjusted, so, that, it, is, aligned, with, the, direction, in, which, the, ship, travels, then, the, effects, of, permanent, magnets, can, be, corrected, for, by, small, magnets, fitted, within, the, case, of, the, compass, the, effect, of, ferromagnetic, materials, in, the, compass, s, environment, can, be, corrected, by, two, iron, balls, mounted, on, either, side, of, the, compass, binnacle, in, concert, with, permanent, magnets, and, a, flinders, bar, the, coefficient, a, 0, displaystyle, a, 0, represents, the, error, in, the, lubber, line, while, a, 1, b, 1, displaystyle, a, 1, b, 1, the, ferromagnetic, effects, and, a, 2, b, 2, displaystyle, a, 2, b, 2, the, non, ferromagnetic, component, a, similar, process, is, used, to, calibrate, the, compass, in, light, general, aviation, aircraft, with, the, compass, deviation, card, often, mounted, permanently, just, above, or, below, the, magnetic, compass, on, the, instrument, panel, fluxgate, electronic, compasses, can, be, calibrated, automatically, and, can, also, be, programmed, with, the, correct, local, compass, variation, so, as, to, indicate, the, true, heading, a, magnetic, compass, points, to, magnetic, north, pole, which, is, approximately, 1, 000, miles, from, the, true, geographic, north, pole, a, magnetic, compass, s, user, can, determine, true, north, by, finding, the, magnetic, north, and, then, correcting, for, variation, and, deviation, variation, is, defined, as, the, angle, between, the, direction, of, true, geographic, north, and, the, direction, of, the, meridian, between, the, magnetic, poles, variation, values, for, most, of, the, oceans, had, been, calculated, and, published, by, 1914, deviation, refers, to, the, response, of, the, compass, to, local, magnetic, fields, caused, by, the, presence, of, iron, and, electric, currents, one, can, partly, compensate, for, these, by, careful, location, of, the, compass, and, the, placement, of, compensating, magnets, under, the, compass, itself, mariners, have, long, known, that, these, measures, do, not, completely, cancel, deviation, hence, they, performed, an, additional, step, by, measuring, the, compass, bearing, of, a, landmark, with, a, known, magnetic, bearing, they, then, pointed, their, ship, to, the, next, compass, point, and, measured, again, graphing, their, results, in, this, way, correction, tables, could, be, created, which, would, be, consulted, when, compasses, were, used, when, traveling, in, those, locations, mariners, are, concerned, about, very, accurate, measurements, however, casual, users, need, not, be, concerned, with, differences, between, magnetic, and, true, north, except, in, areas, of, extreme, magnetic, declination, variance, 20, degrees, or, more, this, is, enough, to, protect, from, walking, in, a, substantially, different, direction, than, expected, over, short, distances, provided, the, terrain, is, fairly, flat, and, visibility, is, not, impaired, by, carefully, recording, distances, time, or, paces, and, magnetic, bearings, traveled, one, can, plot, a, course, and, return, to, one, s, starting, point, using, the, compass, alone, compass, navigation, in, conjunction, with, a, map, terrain, association, requires, a, different, method, to, take, a, map, bearing, or, true, bearing, a, bearing, taken, in, reference, to, true, not, magnetic, north, to, a, destination, with, a, protractor, compass, the, edge, of, the, compass, is, placed, on, the, map, so, that, it, connects, the, current, location, with, the, desired, destination, some, sources, recommend, physically, drawing, a, line, the, orienting, lines, in, the, base, of, the, compass, dial, are, then, rotated, to, align, with, actual, or, true, north, by, aligning, them, with, a, marked, line, of, longitude, or, the, vertical, margin, of, the, map, ignoring, the, compass, needle, entirely, the, resulting, true, bearing, or, map, bearing, may, then, be, read, at, the, degree, indicator, or, direction, of, travel, dot, line, which, may, be, followed, as, an, azimuth, course, to, the, destination, if, a, magnetic, north, bearing, or, compass, bearing, is, desired, the, compass, must, be, adjusted, by, the, amount, of, magnetic, declination, before, using, the, bearing, so, that, both, map, and, compass, are, in, agreement, in, the, given, example, the, large, mountain, in, the, second, photo, was, selected, as, the, target, destination, on, the, map, some, compasses, allow, the, scale, to, be, adjusted, to, compensate, for, the, local, magnetic, declination, if, adjusted, correctly, the, compass, will, give, the, true, bearing, instead, of, the, magnetic, bearing, the, modern, hand, held, protractor, compass, always, has, an, additional, direction, of, travel, dot, arrow, or, indicator, inscribed, on, the, baseplate, to, check, one, s, progress, along, a, course, or, azimuth, or, to, ensure, that, the, object, in, view, is, indeed, the, destination, a, new, compass, reading, may, be, taken, to, the, target, if, visible, here, the, large, mountain, after, pointing, the, dot, arrow, on, the, baseplate, at, the, target, the, compass, is, oriented, so, that, the, needle, is, superimposed, over, the, orienting, arrow, in, the, capsule, the, resulting, bearing, indicated, is, the, magnetic, bearing, to, the, target, again, if, one, is, using, true, or, map, bearings, and, the, compass, does, not, have, preset, pre, adjusted, declination, one, must, additionally, add, or, subtract, magnetic, declination, to, convert, the, magnetic, bearing, into, a, true, bearing, the, exact, value, of, the, magnetic, declination, is, place, dependent, and, varies, over, time, though, declination, is, frequently, given, on, the, map, itself, or, obtainable, on, line, from, various, sites, if, the, hiker, has, been, following, the, correct, path, the, compass, corrected, true, indicated, bearing, should, closely, correspond, to, the, true, bearing, previously, obtained, from, the, map, a, compass, should, be, laid, down, on, a, level, surface, so, that, the, needle, only, rests, or, hangs, on, the, bearing, fused, to, the, compass, casing, if, used, at, a, tilt, the, needle, might, touch, the, casing, on, the, compass, and, not, move, freely, hence, not, pointing, to, the, magnetic, north, accurately, giving, a, faulty, reading, to, see, if, the, needle, is, well, leveled, look, closely, at, the, needle, and, tilt, it, slightly, to, see, if, the, needle, is, swaying, side, to, side, freely, and, the, needle, is, not, contacting, the, casing, of, the, compass, if, the, needle, tilts, to, one, direction, tilt, the, compass, slightly, and, gently, to, the, opposing, direction, until, the, compass, needle, is, horizontal, lengthwise, items, to, avoid, around, compasses, are, magnets, of, any, kind, and, any, electronics, magnetic, fields, from, electronics, can, easily, disrupt, the, needle, preventing, it, from, aligning, with, the, earth, s, magnetic, fields, causing, inaccurate, readings, the, earth, s, natural, magnetic, forces, are, considerably, weak, measuring, at, 0, 5, gauss, and, magnetic, fields, from, household, electronics, can, easily, exceed, it, overpowering, the, compass, needle, exposure, to, strong, magnets, or, magnetic, interference, can, sometimes, cause, the, magnetic, poles, of, the, compass, needle, to, differ, or, even, reverse, avoid, iron, rich, deposits, when, using, a, compass, for, example, certain, rocks, which, contain, magnetic, minerals, like, magnetite, this, is, often, indicated, by, a, rock, with, a, surface, which, is, dark, and, has, a, metallic, luster, not, all, magnetic, mineral, bearing, rocks, have, this, indication, to, see, if, a, rock, or, an, area, is, causing, interference, on, a, compass, get, out, of, the, area, and, see, if, the, needle, on, the, compass, moves, if, it, does, it, means, that, the, area, or, rock, the, compass, was, previously, at, is, causing, interference, and, should, be, avoided, there, are, other, ways, to, find, north, than, the, use, of, magnetism, and, from, a, navigational, point, of, view, a, total, of, seven, possible, ways, exist, where, magnetism, is, one, of, the, seven, two, sensors, that, use, two, of, the, remaining, six, principles, are, often, also, called, compasses, i, e, the, gyrocompass, and, gps, compass, a, gyrocompass, is, similar, to, a, gyroscope, it, is, a, non, magnetic, compass, that, finds, true, north, by, using, an, electrically, powered, fast, spinning, wheel, and, friction, forces, in, order, to, exploit, the, rotation, of, the, earth, gyrocompasses, are, widely, used, on, ships, they, have, two, main, advantages, over, magnetic, compasses, large, ships, typically, rely, on, a, gyrocompass, using, the, magnetic, compass, only, as, a, backup, increasingly, electronic, fluxgate, compasses, are, used, on, smaller, vessels, however, magnetic, compasses, are, still, widely, in, use, as, they, can, be, small, use, simple, reliable, technology, are, comparatively, cheap, are, often, easier, to, use, than, gps, require, no, energy, supply, and, unlike, gps, are, not, affected, by, objects, e, g, trees, that, can, block, the, reception, of, electronic, signals, gps, receivers, using, two, or, more, antennae, mounted, separately, and, blending, the, data, with, an, inertial, motion, unit, imu, can, now, achieve, 0, 02, in, heading, accuracy, and, have, startup, times, in, seconds, rather, than, hours, for, gyrocompass, systems, the, devices, accurately, determine, the, positions, latitudes, longitudes, and, altitude, of, the, antennae, on, the, earth, from, which, the, cardinal, directions, can, be, calculated, manufactured, primarily, for, maritime, and, aviation, applications, they, can, also, detect, pitch, and, roll, of, ships, small, portable, gps, receivers, with, only, a, single, antenna, can, also, determine, directions, if, they, are, being, moved, even, if, only, at, walking, pace, by, accurately, determining, its, position, on, the, earth, at, times, a, few, seconds, apart, the, device, can, calculate, its, speed, and, the, true, bearing, relative, to, true, north, of, its, direction, of, motion, frequently, it, is, preferable, to, measure, the, direction, in, which, a, vehicle, is, actually, moving, rather, than, its, heading, i, e, the, direction, in, which, its, nose, is, pointing, these, directions, may, be, different, if, there, is, a, crosswind, or, tidal, current, gps, compasses, share, the, main, advantages, of, gyrocompasses, they, determine, true, north, as, opposed, to, magnetic, north, and, they, are, unaffected, by, perturbations, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, additionally, compared, with, gyrocompasses, they, are, much, cheaper, they, work, better, in, polar, regions, they, are, less, prone, to, be, affected, by, mechanical, vibration, and, they, can, be, initialized, far, more, quickly, however, they, depend, on, the, functioning, of, and, communication, with, the, gps, satellites, which, might, be, disrupted, by, an, electronic, attack, or, by, the, effects, of, a, severe, solar, storm, gyrocompasses, remain, in, use, for, military, purposes, especially, in, submarines, where, magnetic, and, gps, compasses, are, useless, but, have, been, largely, superseded, by, gps, compasses, with, magnetic, backups, in, civilian, contexts
