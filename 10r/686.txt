a, railway, track, british, english, and, uic, terminology, or, railroad, track, american, english, also, known, as, a, train, track, or, permanent, way, often, perway, in, australia, or, p, way, in, britain, is, the, structure, on, a, railway, or, railroad, consisting, of, the, rails, fasteners, railroad, ties, sleepers, british, english, and, ballast, or, slab, track, plus, the, underlying, subgrade, it, enables, trains, to, move, by, providing, a, dependable, surface, for, their, wheels, to, roll, upon, early, tracks, were, constructed, with, wooden, or, cast, iron, rails, and, wooden, or, stone, sleepers, since, the, 1870s, rails, have, almost, universally, been, made, from, steel, the, first, railway, in, britain, was, the, wollaton, wagonway, built, in, 1603, between, wollaton, and, strelley, in, nottinghamshire, it, used, wooden, rails, and, was, the, first, of, around, 50, wooden, railed, tramways, built, over, the, next, 164, years, these, early, wooden, tramways, typically, used, rails, of, oak, or, beech, attached, to, wooden, sleepers, with, iron, or, wooden, nails, gravel, or, small, stones, were, packed, around, the, sleepers, to, hold, them, in, place, and, provide, a, walkway, for, the, people, or, horses, that, moved, wagons, along, the, track, the, rails, were, usually, about, 3, feet, 0, 91, m, long, and, were, not, joined, instead, adjacent, rails, were, laid, on, a, common, sleeper, the, straight, rails, could, be, angled, at, these, joints, to, form, primitive, curved, track, the, first, iron, rails, laid, in, britain, were, at, the, darby, ironworks, in, coalbrookdale, in, 1767, when, steam, locomotives, were, introduced, starting, in, 1804, the, track, then, in, use, proved, too, weak, to, carry, the, additional, weight, richard, trevithick, s, pioneering, locomotive, at, pen, y, darren, broke, the, plateway, track, and, had, to, be, withdrawn, as, locomotives, became, more, widespread, in, the, 1810s, and, 1820s, engineers, built, rigid, track, formations, with, iron, rails, mounted, on, stone, sleepers, and, cast, iron, chairs, holding, them, in, place, this, proved, to, be, a, mistake, and, was, soon, replaced, with, flexible, track, structures, that, allowed, a, degree, of, elastic, movement, as, trains, passed, over, them, traditionally, tracks, are, constructed, using, flat, bottomed, steel, rails, laid, on, and, spiked, or, screwed, into, timber, or, pre, stressed, concrete, sleepers, known, as, ties, in, north, america, with, crushed, stone, ballast, placed, beneath, and, around, the, sleepers, most, modern, railroads, with, heavy, traffic, use, continuously, welded, rails, that, are, attached, to, the, sleepers, with, base, plates, that, spread, the, load, when, concrete, sleepers, are, used, a, plastic, or, rubber, pad, is, usually, placed, between, the, rail, and, the, tie, plate, rail, is, usually, attached, to, the, sleeper, with, resilient, fastenings, although, cut, spikes, are, widely, used, in, north, america, for, much, of, the, 20th, century, rail, track, used, softwood, timber, sleepers, and, jointed, rails, and, a, considerable, amount, of, this, track, remains, on, secondary, and, tertiary, routes, in, north, america, and, australia, flat, bottomed, rails, were, typically, fastened, to, the, sleepers, with, dog, spikes, through, a, flat, tie, plate, in, britain, and, ireland, bullhead, rails, were, carried, in, cast, iron, chairs, which, were, spiked, to, the, sleepers, in, 1936, the, london, midland, and, scottish, railway, pioneered, the, conversion, to, flat, bottomed, rail, in, britain, though, earlier, lines, had, made, some, use, of, it, jointed, rails, were, used, at, first, because, contemporary, technology, did, not, offer, any, alternative, however, the, intrinsic, weakness, in, resisting, vertical, loading, results, in, the, ballast, becoming, depressed, and, a, heavy, maintenance, workload, is, imposed, to, prevent, unacceptable, geometrical, defects, at, the, joints, the, joints, also, needed, to, be, lubricated, and, wear, at, the, fishplate, joint, bar, mating, surfaces, needed, to, be, rectified, by, shimming, for, this, reason, jointed, track, is, not, financially, appropriate, for, heavily, operated, railroads, timber, sleepers, are, of, many, available, timbers, and, are, often, treated, with, creosote, chromated, copper, arsenate, or, other, wood, preservatives, pre, stressed, concrete, sleepers, are, often, used, where, timber, is, scarce, and, where, tonnage, or, speeds, are, high, steel, is, used, in, some, applications, the, track, ballast, is, customarily, crushed, stone, and, the, purpose, of, this, is, to, support, the, sleepers, and, allow, some, adjustment, of, their, position, while, allowing, free, drainage, a, disadvantage, of, traditional, track, structures, is, the, heavy, demand, for, maintenance, particularly, surfacing, tamping, and, lining, to, restore, the, desired, track, geometry, and, smoothness, of, vehicle, running, weakness, of, the, subgrade, and, drainage, deficiencies, also, lead, to, heavy, maintenance, costs, this, can, be, overcome, by, using, ballastless, track, in, its, simplest, form, this, consists, of, a, continuous, slab, of, concrete, like, a, highway, structure, with, the, rails, supported, directly, on, its, upper, surface, using, a, resilient, pad, there, are, a, number, of, proprietary, systems, variations, include, a, continuous, reinforced, concrete, slab, and, the, use, of, pre, cast, pre, stressed, concrete, units, laid, on, a, base, layer, many, permutations, of, design, have, been, put, forward, however, ballastless, track, has, a, high, initial, cost, and, in, the, case, of, existing, railroads, the, upgrade, to, such, requires, closure, of, the, route, for, a, long, period, its, whole, life, cost, can, be, lower, because, of, the, reduction, in, maintenance, ballastless, track, is, usually, considered, for, new, very, high, speed, or, very, high, loading, routes, in, short, extensions, that, require, additional, strength, e, g, railway, stations, or, for, localised, replacement, where, there, are, exceptional, maintenance, difficulties, for, example, in, tunnels, most, rapid, transit, lines, and, rubber, tyred, metro, systems, use, ballastless, track, early, railways, c, 1840s, experimented, with, continuous, bearing, railtrack, in, which, the, rail, was, supported, along, its, length, with, examples, including, brunel, s, baulk, road, on, the, great, western, railway, as, well, as, use, on, the, newcastle, and, north, shields, railway, on, the, lancashire, and, yorkshire, railway, to, a, design, by, john, hawkshaw, and, elsewhere, continuous, bearing, designs, were, also, promoted, by, other, engineers, the, system, was, tested, on, the, baltimore, and, ohio, railway, in, the, 1840s, but, was, found, to, be, more, expensive, to, maintain, than, rail, with, cross, sleepers, this, type, of, track, still, exists, on, some, bridges, on, network, rail, where, the, timber, baulks, are, called, waybeams, or, longitudinal, timbers, generally, the, speed, over, such, structures, is, low, later, applications, of, continuously, supported, track, include, balfour, beatty, s, embedded, slab, track, which, uses, a, rounded, rectangular, rail, profile, bb14072, embedded, in, a, slipformed, or, pre, cast, concrete, base, development, 2000s, the, embedded, rail, structure, used, in, the, netherlands, since, 1976, initially, used, a, conventional, uic, 54, rail, embedded, in, concrete, and, later, developed, late, 1990s, to, use, a, mushroom, shaped, sa42, rail, profile, a, version, for, light, rail, using, a, rail, supported, in, an, asphalt, concrete, filled, steel, trough, has, also, been, developed, 2002, modern, ladder, track, can, be, considered, a, development, of, baulk, road, ladder, track, utilizes, sleepers, aligned, along, the, same, direction, as, the, rails, with, rung, like, gauge, restraining, cross, members, both, ballasted, and, ballastless, types, exist, modern, track, typically, uses, hot, rolled, steel, with, a, profile, of, an, asymmetrical, rounded, i, beam, unlike, some, other, uses, of, iron, and, steel, railway, rails, are, subject, to, very, high, stresses, and, have, to, be, made, of, very, high, quality, steel, alloy, it, took, many, decades, to, improve, the, quality, of, the, materials, including, the, change, from, iron, to, steel, the, stronger, the, rails, and, the, rest, of, the, trackwork, the, heavier, and, faster, the, trains, the, track, can, carry, other, profiles, of, rail, include, bullhead, rail, grooved, rail, flat, bottomed, rail, vignoles, rail, or, flanged, t, rail, bridge, rail, inverted, u, shaped, used, in, baulk, road, and, barlow, rail, inverted, v, north, american, railroads, until, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, used, rails, 39, feet, 11, 9, m, long, so, they, could, be, carried, in, gondola, cars, open, wagons, often, 40, feet, 12, 2, m, long, as, gondola, sizes, increased, so, did, rail, lengths, according, to, the, railway, gazette, international, the, planned, but, cancelled, 150, kilometre, rail, line, for, the, baffinland, iron, mine, on, baffin, island, would, have, used, older, carbon, steel, alloys, for, its, rails, instead, of, more, modern, higher, performance, alloys, because, modern, alloy, rails, can, become, brittle, at, very, low, temperatures, early, north, american, railroads, used, iron, on, top, of, wooden, rails, as, an, economy, measure, but, gave, up, this, method, of, construction, after, the, iron, came, loose, began, to, curl, and, intruded, into, the, floors, of, the, coaches, the, iron, strap, rail, coming, through, the, floors, of, the, coaches, came, to, be, referred, to, as, snake, heads, by, early, railroaders, the, deeside, tramway, in, north, wales, used, this, form, of, rail, it, opened, around, 1870, and, closed, in, 1947, with, long, sections, still, using, these, rails, it, was, one, of, the, last, uses, of, iron, topped, wooden, rails, rail, is, graded, by, its, linear, density, that, is, its, mass, over, a, standard, length, heavier, rail, can, support, greater, axle, loads, and, higher, train, speeds, without, sustaining, damage, than, lighter, rail, but, at, a, greater, cost, in, north, america, and, the, united, kingdom, rail, is, graded, in, pounds, per, yard, usually, shown, as, pound, or, lb, so, 130, pound, rail, would, weigh, 130, lb, yd, 64, kg, m, the, usual, range, is, 115, to, 141, lb, yd, 57, to, 70, kg, m, in, europe, rail, is, graded, in, kilograms, per, metre, and, the, usual, range, is, 40, to, 60, kg, m, 81, to, 121, lb, yd, the, heaviest, mass, produced, rail, was, 155, pounds, per, yard, 77, kg, m, rolled, for, the, pennsylvania, railroad, the, rails, used, in, rail, transport, are, produced, in, sections, of, fixed, length, rail, lengths, are, made, as, long, as, possible, as, the, joints, between, rails, are, a, source, of, weakness, throughout, the, history, of, rail, production, lengths, have, increased, as, manufacturing, processes, have, improved, the, following, are, lengths, of, single, sections, produced, by, steel, mills, without, any, thermite, welding, shorter, rails, may, be, welded, with, flashbutt, welding, but, the, following, rail, lengths, are, unwelded, welding, of, rails, into, longer, lengths, was, first, introduced, around, 1893, making, train, rides, quieter, and, safer, with, the, introduction, of, thermite, welding, after, 1899, the, process, became, less, labour, intensive, and, ubiquitous, modern, production, techniques, allowed, the, production, of, longer, unwelded, segments, newer, longer, rails, tend, to, be, made, as, simple, multiples, of, older, shorter, rails, so, that, old, rails, can, be, replaced, without, cutting, some, cutting, would, be, needed, as, slightly, longer, rails, are, needed, on, the, outside, of, sharp, curves, compared, to, the, rails, on, the, inside, rails, can, be, supplied, pre, drilled, with, boltholes, for, fishplates, or, without, where, they, will, be, welded, into, place, there, are, usually, two, or, three, boltholes, at, each, end, rails, are, produced, in, fixed, lengths, and, need, to, be, joined, end, to, end, to, make, a, continuous, surface, on, which, trains, may, run, the, traditional, method, of, joining, the, rails, is, to, bolt, them, together, using, metal, fishplates, jointbars, in, the, us, producing, jointed, track, for, more, modern, usage, particularly, where, higher, speeds, are, required, the, lengths, of, rail, may, be, welded, together, to, form, continuous, welded, rail, cwr, jointed, track, is, made, using, lengths, of, rail, usually, around, 20, m, 66, ft, long, in, the, uk, and, 39, or, 78, ft, 12, or, 24, m, long, in, north, america, bolted, together, using, perforated, steel, plates, known, as, fishplates, uk, or, joint, bars, north, america, fishplates, are, usually, 600, mm, 2, ft, long, used, in, pairs, either, side, of, the, rail, ends, and, bolted, together, usually, four, but, sometimes, six, bolts, per, joint, the, bolts, have, alternating, orientations, so, that, in, the, event, of, a, derailment, and, a, wheel, flange, striking, the, joint, only, some, of, the, bolts, will, be, sheared, reducing, the, likelihood, of, the, rails, misaligning, with, each, other, and, exacerbating, the, derailment, this, technique, is, not, applied, universally, european, practice, being, to, have, all, the, bolt, heads, on, the, same, side, of, the, rail, small, gaps, which, function, as, expansion, joints, are, deliberately, left, between, the, rail, ends, to, allow, for, expansion, of, the, rails, in, hot, weather, european, practice, was, to, have, the, rail, joints, on, both, rails, adjacent, to, each, other, while, north, american, practice, is, to, stagger, them, because, of, these, small, gaps, when, trains, pass, over, jointed, tracks, they, make, a, clickety, clack, sound, unless, it, is, well, maintained, jointed, track, does, not, have, the, ride, quality, of, welded, rail, and, is, less, desirable, for, high, speed, trains, however, jointed, track, is, still, used, in, many, countries, on, lower, speed, lines, and, sidings, and, is, used, extensively, in, poorer, countries, due, to, the, lower, construction, cost, and, the, simpler, equipment, required, for, its, installation, and, maintenance, a, major, problem, of, jointed, track, is, cracking, around, the, bolt, holes, which, can, lead, to, breaking, of, the, rail, head, the, running, surface, this, was, the, cause, of, the, hither, green, rail, crash, which, caused, british, railways, to, begin, converting, much, of, its, track, to, continuous, welded, rail, where, track, circuits, exist, for, signalling, purposes, insulated, block, joints, are, required, these, compound, the, weaknesses, of, ordinary, joints, specially, made, glued, joints, where, all, the, gaps, are, filled, with, epoxy, resin, increase, the, strength, again, as, an, alternative, to, the, insulated, joint, audio, frequency, track, circuits, can, be, employed, using, a, tuned, loop, formed, in, approximately, 20, m, 66, ft, of, the, rail, as, part, of, the, blocking, circuit, some, insulated, joints, are, unavoidable, within, turnouts, another, alternative, is, an, axle, counter, which, can, reduce, the, number, of, track, circuits, and, thus, the, number, of, insulated, rail, joints, required, most, modern, railways, use, continuous, welded, rail, cwr, sometimes, referred, to, as, ribbon, rails, or, seamless, rails, in, this, form, of, track, the, rails, are, welded, together, by, utilising, flash, butt, welding, to, form, one, continuous, rail, that, may, be, several, kilometres, long, because, there, are, few, joints, this, form, of, track, is, very, strong, gives, a, smooth, ride, and, needs, less, maintenance, trains, can, travel, on, it, at, higher, speeds, and, with, less, friction, welded, rails, are, more, expensive, to, lay, than, jointed, tracks, but, have, much, lower, maintenance, costs, the, first, welded, track, was, used, in, germany, in, 1924, and, has, become, common, on, main, lines, since, the, 1950s, the, preferred, process, of, flash, butt, welding, involves, an, automated, track, laying, machine, running, a, strong, electric, current, through, the, touching, ends, of, two, unjoined, rails, the, ends, become, white, hot, due, to, electrical, resistance, and, are, then, pressed, together, forming, a, strong, weld, thermite, welding, is, used, to, repair, or, splice, together, existing, cwr, segments, this, is, a, manual, process, requiring, a, reaction, crucible, and, form, to, contain, the, molten, iron, north, american, practice, is, to, weld, 1, 4, mile, long, 400, m, segments, of, rail, at, a, rail, facility, and, load, it, on, a, special, train, to, carry, it, to, the, job, site, this, train, is, designed, to, carry, many, segments, of, rail, which, are, placed, so, they, can, slide, off, their, racks, to, the, rear, of, the, train, and, be, attached, to, the, ties, sleepers, in, a, continuous, operation, if, not, restrained, rails, would, lengthen, in, hot, weather, and, shrink, in, cold, weather, to, provide, this, restraint, the, rail, is, prevented, from, moving, in, relation, to, the, sleeper, by, use, of, clips, or, anchors, attention, needs, to, be, paid, to, compacting, the, ballast, effectively, including, under, between, and, at, the, ends, of, the, sleepers, to, prevent, the, sleepers, from, moving, anchors, are, more, common, for, wooden, sleepers, whereas, most, concrete, or, steel, sleepers, are, fastened, to, the, rail, by, special, clips, that, resist, longitudinal, movement, of, the, rail, there, is, no, theoretical, limit, to, how, long, a, welded, rail, can, be, however, if, longitudinal, and, lateral, restraint, are, insufficient, the, track, could, become, distorted, in, hot, weather, and, cause, a, derailment, distortion, due, to, heat, expansion, is, known, in, north, america, as, sun, kink, and, elsewhere, as, buckling, in, extreme, hot, weather, special, inspections, are, required, to, monitor, sections, of, track, known, to, be, problematic, in, north, american, practice, extreme, temperature, conditions, will, trigger, slow, orders, to, allow, for, crews, to, react, to, buckling, or, sun, kinks, if, encountered, the, german, railway, company, deutsche, bahn, is, starting, to, paint, rails, white, to, lower, the, peak, temperatures, reached, in, summer, days, after, new, segments, of, rail, are, laid, or, defective, rails, replaced, welded, in, the, rails, can, be, artificially, stressed, if, the, temperature, of, the, rail, during, laying, is, cooler, than, what, is, desired, the, stressing, process, involves, either, heating, the, rails, causing, them, to, expand, or, stretching, the, rails, with, hydraulic, equipment, they, are, then, fastened, clipped, to, the, sleepers, in, their, expanded, form, this, process, ensures, that, the, rail, will, not, expand, much, further, in, subsequent, hot, weather, in, cold, weather, the, rails, try, to, contract, but, because, they, are, firmly, fastened, cannot, do, so, in, effect, stressed, rails, are, a, bit, like, a, piece, of, stretched, elastic, firmly, fastened, down, in, extremely, cold, weather, rails, are, heated, to, prevent, pull, aparts, cwr, is, laid, including, fastening, at, a, temperature, roughly, midway, between, the, extremes, experienced, at, that, location, this, is, known, as, the, rail, neutral, temperature, this, installation, procedure, is, intended, to, prevent, tracks, from, buckling, in, summer, heat, or, pulling, apart, in, the, winter, cold, in, north, america, because, broken, rails, are, typically, detected, by, interruption, of, the, current, in, the, signaling, system, they, are, seen, as, less, of, a, potential, hazard, than, undetected, heat, kinks, joints, are, used, in, the, continuous, welded, rail, when, necessary, usually, for, signal, circuit, gaps, instead, of, a, joint, that, passes, straight, across, the, rail, the, two, rail, ends, are, sometimes, cut, at, an, angle, to, give, a, smoother, transition, in, extreme, cases, such, as, at, the, end, of, long, bridges, a, breather, switch, referred, to, in, north, america, and, britain, as, an, expansion, joint, gives, a, smooth, path, for, the, wheels, while, allowing, the, end, of, one, rail, to, expand, relative, to, the, next, rail, a, sleeper, tie, or, crosstie, is, a, rectangular, object, on, which, the, rails, are, supported, and, fixed, the, sleeper, has, two, main, roles, to, transfer, the, loads, from, the, rails, to, the, track, ballast, and, the, ground, underneath, and, to, hold, the, rails, to, the, correct, width, apart, to, maintain, the, rail, gauge, they, are, generally, laid, transversely, to, the, rails, various, methods, exist, for, fixing, the, rail, to, the, sleeper, historically, spikes, gave, way, to, cast, iron, chairs, fixed, to, the, sleeper, more, recently, springs, such, as, pandrol, clips, are, used, to, fix, the, rail, to, the, sleeper, chair, sometimes, rail, tracks, are, designed, to, be, portable, and, moved, from, one, place, to, another, as, required, during, construction, of, the, panama, canal, tracks, were, moved, around, excavation, works, these, track, gauge, were, 5, ft, 1, 524, mm, and, the, rolling, stock, full, size, portable, tracks, have, often, been, used, in, open, pit, mines, in, 1880, in, new, york, city, sections, of, heavy, portable, track, along, with, much, other, improvised, technology, helped, in, the, move, of, the, ancient, obelisk, in, central, park, to, its, final, location, from, the, dock, where, it, was, unloaded, from, the, cargo, ship, ss, dessoug, cane, railways, often, had, permanent, tracks, for, the, main, lines, with, portable, tracks, serving, the, canefields, themselves, these, tracks, were, narrow, gauge, for, example, 2, ft, 610, mm, and, the, portable, track, came, in, straights, curves, and, turnouts, rather, like, on, a, model, railway, decauville, was, a, source, of, many, portable, light, rail, tracks, also, used, for, military, purposes, the, permanent, way, is, so, called, because, temporary, way, tracks, were, often, used, in, the, construction, of, that, permanent, way, the, geometry, of, the, tracks, is, three, dimensional, by, nature, but, the, standards, that, express, the, speed, limits, and, other, regulations, in, the, areas, of, track, gauge, alignment, elevation, curvature, and, track, surface, are, usually, expressed, in, two, separate, layouts, for, horizontal, and, vertical, horizontal, layout, is, the, track, layout, on, the, horizontal, plane, this, involves, the, layout, of, three, main, track, types, tangent, track, straight, line, curved, track, and, track, transition, curve, also, called, transition, spiral, or, spiral, which, connects, between, a, tangent, and, a, curved, track, vertical, layout, is, the, track, layout, on, the, vertical, plane, including, the, concepts, such, as, crosslevel, cant, and, gradient, a, sidetrack, is, a, railroad, track, other, than, siding, that, is, auxiliary, to, the, main, track, the, word, is, also, used, as, a, verb, without, object, to, refer, to, the, movement, of, trains, and, railcars, from, the, main, track, to, a, siding, and, in, common, parlance, to, refer, to, giving, in, to, distractions, apart, from, a, main, subject, sidetracks, are, used, by, railroads, to, order, and, organise, the, flow, of, rail, traffic, during, the, early, days, of, rail, there, was, considerable, variation, in, the, gauge, used, by, different, systems, and, in, the, uk, during, the, railway, building, boom, of, the, 1840s, brunel, s, broad, gauge, of, 7, ft, 1, 4, in, 2, 140, mm, was, in, competition, with, what, was, referred, to, at, the, time, as, the, narrow, gauge, of, 1, 435, mm, 4, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, eventually, the, 1, 435, mm, 4, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, gauge, won, the, battle, and, became, the, standard, gauge, with, the, term, narrow, gauge, henceforth, used, for, gauges, narrower, than, the, new, standard, as, of, 2017, about, 60, of, the, world, s, railways, use, a, gauge, of, 1, 435, mm, 4, ft, 8, 1, 2, in, known, as, standard, or, international, gauge, gauges, wider, than, standard, gauge, are, called, broad, gauge, narrower, narrow, gauge, some, stretches, of, track, are, dual, gauge, with, three, or, sometimes, four, parallel, rails, in, place, of, the, usual, two, to, allow, trains, of, two, different, gauges, to, use, the, same, track, gauge, can, safely, vary, over, a, range, for, example, u, s, federal, safety, standards, allow, standard, gauge, to, vary, from, 4, ft, 8, in, 1, 420, mm, to, 4, ft, 9, 1, 2, in, 1, 460, mm, for, operation, up, to, 60, mph, 97, km, h, track, needs, regular, maintenance, to, remain, in, good, order, especially, when, high, speed, trains, are, involved, inadequate, maintenance, may, lead, to, a, slow, order, north, american, terminology, or, temporary, speed, restriction, in, the, united, kingdom, being, imposed, to, avoid, accidents, see, slow, zone, track, maintenance, was, at, one, time, hard, manual, labour, requiring, teams, of, labourers, or, trackmen, us, gandy, dancers, uk, platelayers, australia, fettlers, who, used, lining, bars, to, correct, irregularities, in, horizontal, alignment, line, of, the, track, and, tamping, and, jacks, to, correct, vertical, irregularities, surface, currently, maintenance, is, facilitated, by, a, variety, of, specialised, machines, the, surface, of, the, head, of, each, of, the, two, rails, can, be, maintained, by, using, a, railgrinder, common, maintenance, jobs, include, changing, sleepers, lubricating, and, adjusting, switches, tightening, loose, track, components, and, surfacing, and, lining, track, to, keep, straight, sections, straight, and, curves, within, maintenance, limits, the, process, of, sleeper, and, rail, replacement, can, be, automated, by, using, a, track, renewal, train, spraying, ballast, with, herbicide, to, prevent, weeds, growing, through, and, redistributing, the, ballast, is, typically, done, with, a, special, weed, killing, train, over, time, ballast, is, crushed, or, moved, by, the, weight, of, trains, passing, over, it, periodically, requiring, relevelling, tamping, and, eventually, to, be, cleaned, or, replaced, if, this, is, not, done, the, tracks, may, become, uneven, causing, swaying, rough, riding, and, possibly, derailments, an, alternative, to, tamping, is, to, lift, the, rails, and, sleepers, and, reinsert, the, ballast, beneath, for, this, specialist, stoneblower, trains, are, used, rail, inspections, utilize, nondestructive, testing, methods, to, detect, internal, flaws, in, the, rails, this, is, done, by, using, specially, equipped, hirail, trucks, inspection, cars, or, in, some, cases, handheld, inspection, devices, rails, must, be, replaced, before, the, railhead, profile, wears, to, a, degree, that, may, trigger, a, derailment, worn, mainline, rails, usually, have, sufficient, life, remaining, to, be, used, on, a, branch, line, siding, or, stub, afterwards, and, are, cascaded, to, those, applications, the, environmental, conditions, along, railroad, track, create, a, unique, railway, ecosystem, this, is, particularly, so, in, the, united, kingdom, where, steam, locomotives, are, only, used, on, special, services, and, vegetation, has, not, been, trimmed, back, so, thoroughly, this, creates, a, fire, risk, in, prolonged, dry, weather, in, the, uk, the, cess, is, used, by, track, repair, crews, to, walk, to, a, work, site, and, as, a, safe, place, to, stand, when, a, train, is, passing, this, helps, when, doing, minor, work, while, needing, to, keep, trains, running, by, not, needing, a, hi, railer, or, transport, vehicle, blocking, the, line, to, transport, crew, to, get, to, the, site, railway, tracks, are, generally, laid, on, a, bed, of, stone, track, ballast, or, track, bed, which, in, turn, is, supported, by, prepared, earthworks, known, as, the, track, formation, the, formation, comprises, the, subgrade, and, a, layer, of, sand, or, stone, dust, often, sandwiched, in, impervious, plastic, known, as, the, blanket, which, restricts, the, upward, migration, of, wet, clay, or, silt, there, may, also, be, layers, of, waterproof, fabric, to, prevent, water, penetrating, to, the, subgrade, the, track, and, ballast, form, the, permanent, way, the, foundation, may, refer, to, the, ballast, and, formation, i, e, all, man, made, structures, below, the, tracks, some, railroads, are, using, asphalt, pavement, below, the, ballast, in, order, to, keep, dirt, and, moisture, from, moving, into, the, ballast, and, spoiling, it, the, fresh, asphalt, also, serves, to, stabilize, the, ballast, so, it, does, not, move, around, so, easily, additional, measures, are, required, where, the, track, is, laid, over, permafrost, such, as, on, the, qingzang, railway, in, tibet, for, example, transverse, pipes, through, the, subgrade, allow, cold, air, to, penetrate, the, formation, and, prevent, that, subgrade, from, melting, geosynthetics, are, used, to, reduce, or, replace, traditional, layers, in, trackbed, construction, and, rehabilitation, worldwide, to, improve, track, support, and, reduce, track, maintenance, costs, reinforcement, geosynthetics, such, as, geocells, which, rely, on, 3d, soil, confinement, mechanisms, have, demonstrated, efficacy, in, stabilizing, soft, subgrade, soils, and, reinforcing, substructural, layers, to, limit, progressive, track, degradation, reinforcement, geosynthetics, increase, soil, bearing, capacity, limit, ballast, movement, and, degradation, and, reduce, differential, settlement, that, affects, track, geometry, they, also, reduce, construction, time, and, cost, while, reducing, environmental, impact, and, carbon, footprint, the, increased, use, of, geosynthetic, reinforcement, solutions, is, supported, by, new, high, performance, geocell, materials, e, g, npa, novel, polymeric, alloy, published, research, case, studies, projects, and, international, standards, iso, astm, crow, sbrcurnet, the, hybrid, use, of, high, performance, geogrids, at, the, subgrade, and, high, performance, geocell, in, the, upper, subbase, subballast, layer, has, been, shown, to, increase, the, reinforcement, factor, greater, than, their, separate, sums, and, is, particularly, effective, in, attenuating, heaving, of, expansive, subgrade, clay, soils, a, field, test, project, on, amtrak, s, ne, corridor, suffering, clay, mud, pumping, demonstrated, how, the, hybrid, solution, improved, track, quality, index, tqi, significantly, reduced, track, geometry, degradation, and, lowered, track, surface, maintenance, by, factor, of, 6, 7x, utilizing, high, performance, npa, geocell, geosynthetic, reinforcement, is, also, used, to, stabilize, railway, embankments, which, must, be, robust, enough, to, withstand, repeated, cyclical, loading, geocells, can, utilize, recycled, marginal, or, poorly, graded, granular, material, to, create, stable, embankments, make, railway, construction, more, economical, and, sustainable, some, buses, can, use, tracks, this, concept, came, out, of, germany, and, was, called, o, bahn, the, first, such, track, the, o, bahn, busway, was, built, in, adelaide, australia
