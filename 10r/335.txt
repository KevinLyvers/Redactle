the, channel, tunnel, french, tunnel, sous, la, manche, sometimes, referred, to, informally, as, the, chunnel, is, a, 50, 46, kilometre, 31, 35, mi, undersea, railway, tunnel, opened, in, 1994, that, connects, folkestone, kent, england, with, coquelles, pas, de, calais, france, beneath, the, english, channel, at, the, strait, of, dover, it, is, the, only, fixed, link, between, the, island, of, great, britain, and, the, european, mainland, at, its, lowest, point, it, is, 75, metres, 246, ft, below, the, sea, bed, and, 115, metres, 377, ft, below, sea, level, at, 37, 9, kilometres, 23, 5, mi, it, has, the, longest, underwater, section, of, any, tunnel, in, the, world, and, is, the, third, longest, railway, tunnel, in, the, world, the, speed, limit, for, trains, through, the, tunnel, is, 160, kilometres, per, hour, 99, mph, the, tunnel, is, owned, and, operated, by, getlink, formerly, groupe, eurotunnel, the, tunnel, carries, high, speed, eurostar, passenger, trains, leshuttle, services, for, road, vehicles, and, freight, trains, it, connects, end, to, end, with, high, speed, railway, lines, the, lgv, nord, in, france, and, high, speed, 1, in, england, in, 2017, rail, services, carried, 10, 3, million, passengers, and, 1, 22, million, tonnes, of, freight, and, the, shuttle, carried, 10, 4, million, passengers, 2, 6, million, cars, 51, 000, coaches, and, 1, 6, million, lorries, equivalent, to, 21, 3, million, tonnes, of, freight, compared, with, 11, 7, million, passengers, 2, 6, million, lorries, and, 2, 2, million, cars, by, sea, through, the, port, of, dover, plans, to, build, a, cross, channel, tunnel, were, proposed, as, early, as, 1802, but, british, political, and, media, criticism, motivated, by, fears, of, compromising, national, security, had, disrupted, attempts, to, build, one, an, early, unsuccessful, attempt, was, made, in, the, late, 19th, century, on, the, english, side, in, the, hope, of, forcing, the, hand, of, the, english, government, the, eventual, successful, project, organised, by, eurotunnel, began, construction, in, 1988, and, opened, in, 1994, estimated, to, cost, 5, 5, billion, in, 1985, it, was, at, the, time, the, most, expensive, construction, project, ever, proposed, the, cost, finally, amounted, to, 9, billion, equivalent, to, 22, 6, billion, in, 2023, since, its, opening, the, tunnel, has, experienced, occasional, mechanical, problems, both, fires, and, cold, weather, have, temporarily, disrupted, its, operation, since, at, least, 1997, aggregations, of, migrants, around, calais, seeking, entry, to, the, united, kingdom, such, as, through, the, tunnel, have, prompted, deterrence, and, countermeasures, in, 1802, albert, mathieu, favier, a, french, mining, engineer, proposed, a, tunnel, under, the, english, channel, with, illumination, from, oil, lamps, horse, drawn, coaches, and, an, artificial, island, positioned, mid, channel, for, changing, horses, his, design, envisaged, a, bored, two, level, tunnel, with, the, top, tunnel, used, for, transport, and, the, bottom, one, for, groundwater, flows, in, 1839, aim, thom, de, gamond, a, frenchman, performed, the, first, geological, and, hydrographical, surveys, on, the, channel, between, calais, and, dover, he, explored, several, schemes, and, in, 1856, presented, a, proposal, to, napoleon, iii, for, a, mined, railway, tunnel, from, cap, gris, nez, to, east, wear, point, with, a, port, airshaft, on, the, varne, sandbank, at, a, cost, of, 170, million, francs, or, less, than, 7, million, in, 1865, a, deputation, led, by, george, ward, hunt, proposed, the, idea, of, a, tunnel, to, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, of, the, day, william, ewart, gladstone, in, 1866, henry, marc, brunel, made, a, survey, of, the, floor, of, the, strait, of, dover, by, his, results, he, proved, that, the, floor, was, composed, of, chalk, like, the, adjoining, cliffs, and, thus, a, tunnel, was, feasible, for, this, survey, he, invented, the, gravity, corer, which, is, still, used, in, geology, around, 1866, william, low, and, sir, john, hawkshaw, promoted, tunnel, ideas, but, apart, from, preliminary, geological, studies, none, were, implemented, an, official, anglo, french, protocol, was, established, in, 1876, for, a, cross, channel, railway, tunnel, in, 1881, british, railway, entrepreneur, sir, edward, watkin, and, alexandre, lavalley, a, french, suez, canal, contractor, were, in, the, anglo, french, submarine, railway, company, that, conducted, exploratory, work, on, both, sides, of, the, channel, from, june, 1882, to, march, 1883, the, british, tunnel, boring, machine, tunnelled, through, chalk, a, total, of, 1, 840, m, 6, 037, ft, while, lavalley, used, a, similar, machine, to, drill, 1, 669, m, 5, 476, ft, from, sangatte, on, the, french, side, however, the, cross, channel, tunnel, project, was, abandoned, in, 1883, despite, this, success, after, fears, raised, by, the, british, military, that, an, underwater, tunnel, might, be, used, as, an, invasion, route, nevertheless, in, 1883, this, tbm, was, used, to, bore, a, railway, ventilation, tunnel, 7, feet, 2, 1, m, in, diameter, and, 6, 750, feet, 2, 060, m, long, between, birkenhead, and, liverpool, england, through, sandstone, under, the, mersey, river, these, early, works, were, encountered, more, than, a, century, later, during, the, project, transmanche, link, tml, a, 1907, film, tunnelling, the, english, channel, by, pioneer, filmmaker, georges, m, li, s, depicts, king, edward, vii, and, president, armand, falli, res, dreaming, of, building, a, tunnel, under, the, english, channel, in, 1919, during, the, paris, peace, conference, british, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, repeatedly, brought, up, the, idea, of, a, channel, tunnel, as, a, way, of, reassuring, france, about, british, willingness, to, defend, against, another, german, attack, the, french, did, not, take, the, idea, seriously, and, nothing, came, of, the, proposal, in, the, 1920s, winston, churchill, advocated, for, the, channel, tunnel, using, that, exact, name, in, his, essay, should, strategists, veto, the, tunnel, it, was, published, on, 27, july, 1924, in, the, weekly, dispatch, and, argued, vehemently, against, the, idea, that, the, tunnel, could, be, used, by, a, continental, enemy, in, an, invasion, of, britain, churchill, expressed, his, enthusiasm, for, the, project, again, in, an, article, for, the, daily, mail, on, 12, february, 1936, why, not, a, channel, tunnel, there, was, another, proposal, in, 1929, but, nothing, came, of, this, discussion, and, the, idea, was, abandoned, proponents, estimated, the, construction, cost, at, us, 150, million, the, engineers, had, addressed, the, concerns, of, both, nations, military, leaders, by, designing, two, sumps, one, near, the, coast, of, each, country, that, could, be, flooded, at, will, to, block, the, tunnel, but, this, did, not, appease, the, military, or, dispel, concerns, about, hordes, of, tourists, who, would, disrupt, english, life, a, british, film, from, gaumont, studios, the, tunnel, also, known, as, transatlantic, tunnel, was, released, in, 1935, as, a, science, fiction, project, concerning, the, creation, of, a, transatlantic, tunnel, it, referred, briefly, to, its, protagonist, a, mr, mcallan, as, having, completed, a, british, channel, tunnel, successfully, in, 1940, five, years, into, the, future, of, the, film, s, release, military, fears, continued, during, world, war, ii, after, the, surrender, of, france, as, britain, prepared, for, an, expected, german, invasion, a, royal, navy, officer, in, the, directorate, of, miscellaneous, weapons, development, calculated, that, hitler, could, use, slave, labour, to, build, two, channel, tunnels, in, 18, months, the, estimate, caused, rumours, that, germany, had, already, begun, digging, by, 1955, defence, arguments, had, become, less, relevant, due, to, the, dominance, of, air, power, and, both, the, british, and, french, governments, supported, technical, and, geological, surveys, in, 1958, the, 1881, workings, were, cleared, in, preparation, for, a, 100, 000, geological, survey, by, the, channel, tunnel, study, group, 30, of, the, funding, came, from, channel, tunnel, co, ltd, the, largest, shareholder, of, which, was, the, british, transport, commission, as, successor, to, the, south, eastern, railway, a, detailed, geological, survey, was, carried, out, in, 1964, and, 1965, although, the, two, countries, agreed, to, build, a, tunnel, in, 1964, the, phase, 1, initial, studies, and, signing, of, a, second, agreement, to, cover, phase, 2, took, until, 1973, the, plan, described, a, government, funded, project, to, create, two, tunnels, to, accommodate, car, shuttle, wagons, on, either, side, of, a, service, tunnel, construction, started, on, both, sides, of, the, channel, in, 1974, on, 20, january, 1975, to, the, dismay, of, their, french, partners, the, then, governing, labour, party, in, britain, cancelled, the, project, due, to, uncertainty, about, the, uk, s, membership, of, the, european, economic, community, doubling, cost, estimates, amid, the, general, economic, crisis, at, the, time, by, this, time, the, british, tunnel, boring, machine, was, ready, and, the, ministry, of, transport, had, performed, a, 300, m, 980, ft, experimental, drive, this, short, tunnel, named, adit, a1, was, eventually, reused, as, the, starting, and, access, point, for, tunnelling, operations, from, the, british, side, and, remains, an, access, point, to, the, service, tunnel, the, cancellation, costs, were, estimated, at, 17, million, on, the, french, side, a, tunnel, boring, machine, had, been, installed, underground, in, a, stub, tunnel, it, lay, there, for, 14, years, until, 1988, when, it, was, sold, dismantled, refurbished, and, shipped, to, turkey, where, it, was, used, to, drive, the, moda, tunnel, for, the, istanbul, sewerage, scheme, in, 1979, the, mouse, hole, project, was, suggested, when, the, conservatives, came, to, power, in, britain, the, concept, was, a, single, track, rail, tunnel, with, a, service, tunnel, but, without, shuttle, terminals, the, british, government, took, no, interest, in, funding, the, project, but, british, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, did, not, object, to, a, privately, funded, project, although, she, said, she, assumed, it, would, be, for, cars, rather, than, trains, in, 1981, thatcher, and, french, president, fran, ois, mitterrand, agreed, to, establish, a, working, group, to, evaluate, a, privately, funded, project, in, june, 1982, the, franco, british, study, group, favoured, a, twin, tunnel, to, accommodate, conventional, trains, and, a, vehicle, shuttle, service, in, april, 1985, promoters, were, invited, to, submit, scheme, proposals, four, submissions, were, shortlisted, the, cross, channel, ferry, industry, protested, using, the, name, flexilink, in, 1975, there, was, no, campaign, protesting, a, fixed, link, with, one, of, the, largest, ferry, operators, sealink, being, state, owned, flexilink, continued, rousing, opposition, throughout, 1986, and, 1987, public, opinion, strongly, favoured, a, drive, through, tunnel, but, concerns, about, ventilation, accident, management, and, driver, mesmerisation, resulted, in, the, only, shortlisted, rail, submission, ctg, f, m, being, awarded, the, project, in, january, 1986, reasons, given, for, the, selection, included, that, it, caused, least, disruption, to, shipping, in, the, channel, and, least, environmental, disruption, was, the, best, protected, against, terrorism, and, was, the, most, likely, to, attract, sufficient, private, finance, the, british, channel, tunnel, group, consisted, of, two, banks, and, five, construction, companies, while, their, french, counterparts, france, manche, consisted, of, three, banks, and, five, construction, companies, the, banks, role, was, to, advise, on, financing, and, secure, loan, commitments, on, 2, july, 1985, the, groups, formed, channel, tunnel, group, france, manche, ctg, f, m, their, submission, to, the, british, and, french, governments, was, drawn, from, the, 1975, project, including, 11, volumes, and, a, substantial, environmental, impact, statement, the, anglo, french, treaty, on, the, channel, tunnel, was, signed, by, both, governments, in, canterbury, cathedral, the, treaty, of, canterbury, 1986, prepared, the, concession, for, the, construction, and, operation, of, the, fixed, link, by, privately, owned, companies, and, outlined, arbitration, methods, to, be, used, in, the, event, of, disputes, it, established, the, intergovernmental, commission, igc, responsible, for, monitoring, all, matters, associated, with, the, tunnel, s, construction, and, operation, on, behalf, of, the, british, and, french, governments, and, a, safety, authority, to, advise, the, igc, it, drew, a, land, frontier, between, the, two, countries, in, the, middle, of, the, channel, tunnel, the, first, of, its, kind, design, and, construction, were, done, by, the, ten, construction, companies, in, the, ctg, f, m, group, the, french, terminal, and, boring, from, sangatte, were, done, by, the, five, french, construction, companies, in, the, joint, venture, group, gie, transmanche, construction,

by, a, bi, national, project, organisation, transmanche, link, tml, the, ma, tre, d, oeuvre, was, a, supervisory, engineering, body, employed, by, eurotunnel, under, the, terms, of, the, concession, that, monitored, the, project, and, reported, to, the, governments, and, banks, in, france, with, its, long, tradition, of, infrastructure, investment, the, project, had, widespread, approval, the, french, national, assembly, approved, it, unanimously, in, april, 1987, and, after, a, public, inquiry, the, senate, approved, it, unanimously, in, june, in, britain, select, committees, examined, the, proposal, making, history, by, holding, hearings, away, from, westminster, in, kent, in, february, 1987, the, third, reading, of, the, channel, tunnel, bill, took, place, in, the, house, of, commons, and, passed, by, 94, votes, to, 22, the, channel, tunnel, act, gained, royal, assent, and, passed, into, law, in, july, parliamentary, support, for, the, project, came, partly, from, provincial, members, of, parliament, on, the, basis, of, promises, of, regional, eurostar, through, train, services, that, never, materialised, the, promises, were, repeated, in, 1996, when, the, contract, for, construction, of, the, channel, tunnel, rail, link, was, awarded, the, tunnel, is, a, build, own, operate, transfer, boot, project, with, a, concession, tml, would, design, and, build, the, tunnel, but, financing, was, through, a, separate, legal, entity, eurotunnel, eurotunnel, absorbed, ctg, f, m, and, signed, a, construction, contract, with, tml, but, the, british, and, french, governments, controlled, final, engineering, and, safety, decisions, now, managed, by, the, channel, tunnel, safety, authority, the, british, and, french, governments, gave, eurotunnel, a, 55, year, operating, concession, from, 1987, extended, by, 10, years, to, 65, years, in, 1993, to, repay, loans, and, pay, dividends, a, railway, usage, agreement, was, signed, between, eurotunnel, british, rail, and, sncf, guaranteeing, future, revenue, in, exchange, for, the, railways, obtaining, half, of, the, tunnel, s, capacity, private, funding, for, such, a, complex, infrastructure, project, was, of, unprecedented, scale, initial, equity, of, 45, million, was, raised, by, ctg, f, m, increased, by, 206, million, private, institutional, placement, 770, million, was, raised, in, a, public, share,

tbms, cut, through, chalk, marl, to, construct, two, rail, tunnels, and, a, service, tunnel, the, vehicle, shuttle, terminals, are, at, cheriton, part, of, folkestone, and, coquelles, and, are, connected, to, the, english, m20, and, french, a16, motorways, respectively, tunnelling, commenced, in, 1988, and, the, tunnel, began, operating, in, 1994, at, the, peak, of, construction, 15, 000, people, were, employed, with, daily, expenditure, over, 3, million, ten, workers, eight, of, them, british, were, killed, during, construction, between, 1987, and, 1993, most, in, the, first, few, months, of, boring, a, 50, mm, 2, 0, in, diameter, pilot, hole, allowed, the, service, tunnel, to, break, through, without, ceremony, on, 30, october, 1990, on, 1, december, 1990, englishman, graham, fagg, and, frenchman, phillippe, cozette, broke, through, the, service, tunnel, with, the, media, watching, eurotunnel, completed, the, tunnel, on, time, a, bbc, tv, television, commentator, called, graham, fagg, the, first, man, to, cross, the, channel, by, land, for, 8000, years, the, two, tunnelling, efforts, met, each, other, with, an, offset, of, only, 36, 2, cm, 14, 3, in, a, paddington, bear, soft, toy, was, chosen, by, british, tunnellers, as, the, first, item, to, pass, through, to, their, french, counterparts, when, the, two, sides, met, the, tunnel, was, officially, opened, one, year, later, than, originally, planned, by, the, french, president, fran, ois, mitterrand, and, queen, elizabeth, ii, at, a, ceremony, in, calais, on, 6, may, 1994, the, queen, travelled, through, the, tunnel, to, calais, on, a, eurostar, train, which, stopped, nose, to, nose, with, the, train, that, carried, president, mitterrand, from, paris, after, the, ceremony, president, mitterrand, and, the, queen, travelled, on, le, shuttle, to, a, similar, ceremony, in, folkestone, a, full, public, service, did, not, start, for, several, months, the, first, freight, train, however, ran, on, 1, june, 1994, and, carried, rover, and, mini, cars, being, exported, to, italy, the, channel, tunnel, rail, link, ctrl, now, called, high, speed, 1, runs, 69, miles, 111, km, from, st, pancras, railway, station, in, london, to, the, tunnel, portal, at, folkestone, in, kent, it, cost, 5, 8, billion, on, 16, september, 2003, the, prime, minister, tony, blair, opened, the, first, section, of, high, speed, 1, from, folkestone, to, north, kent, on, 6, november, 2007, the, queen, officially, opened, high, speed, 1, and, st, pancras, international, station, replacing, the, original, slower, link,

hour, 51, minutes, in, 1994, the, american, society, of, civil, engineers, elected, the, tunnel, as, one, of, the, seven, modern, wonders, of, the, world, in, 1995, the, american, magazine, popular, mechanics, published, the, results, the, opening, was, phased, for, various, services, offered, as, the, channel, tunnel, safety, authority, the, igc, gave, permission, for, various, services, to, begin, at, several, dates, over, the, period, 1994, 1995, but, start, up, dates, were, a, few, days, later, site, investigation, undertaken, in, the, 20, years, before, construction, confirmed, earlier, speculations, that, a, tunnel, could, be, bored, through, a, chalk, marl, stratum, the, chalk, marl, is, conducive, to, tunnelling, with, impermeability, ease, of, excavation, and, strength, the, chalk, marl, runs, along, the, entire, length, of, the, english, side, of, the, tunnel, but, on, the, french, side, a, length, of, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, mi, has, variable, and, difficult, geology, the, tunnel, consists, of, three, bores, two, 7, 6, metre, 24, ft, 11, in, diameter, rail, tunnels, 30, metres, 98, ft, apart, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, in, length, with, a, 4, 8, metre, 15, ft, 9, in, diameter, service, tunnel, in, between, the, three, bores, are, connected, by, cross, passages, and, piston, relief, ducts, the, service, tunnel, was, used, as, a, pilot, tunnel, boring, ahead, of, the, main, tunnels, to, determine, the, conditions, english, access, was, provided, at, shakespeare, cliff, and, french, access, from, a, shaft, at, sangatte, the, french, side, used, five, tunnel, boring, machines, tbms, and, the, english, side, six, the, service, tunnel, uses, service, tunnel, transport, system, stts, and, light, service, tunnel, vehicles, ladogs, fire, safety, was, a, critical, design, issue, between, the, portals, at, beussingue, and, castle, hill, the, tunnel, is, 50, 5, kilometres, 31, mi, long, with, 3, 3, kilometres, 2, mi, under, land, on, the, french, side, and, 9, 3, kilometres, 6, mi, on, the, uk, side, and, 37, 9, kilometres, 24, mi, under, sea, it, is, the, third, longest, rail, tunnel, in, the, world, behind, the, gotthard, base, tunnel, in, switzerland, and, the, seikan, tunnel, in, japan, but, with, the, longest, under, sea, section, the, average, depth, is, 45, metres, 148, ft, below, the, seabed, on, the, uk, side, of, the, expected, 5, million, cubic, metres, 6, 5, 10, 6, cu, yd, of, spoil, approximately, 1, million, cubic, metres, 1, 3, 10, 6, cu, yd, was, used, for, fill, at, the, terminal, site, and, the, remainder, was, deposited, at, lower, shakespeare, cliff, behind, a, seawall, reclaiming, 74, acres, 30, ha, of, land, this, land, was, then, made, into, the, samphire, hoe, country, park, environmental, assessment, did, not, identify, any, major, risks, for, the, project, and, further, studies, into, safety, noise, and, air, pollution, were, overall, positive, however, environmental, objections, were, raised, concerning, a, high, speed, link, to, london, successful, tunnelling, required, a, sound, understanding, of, topography, and, geology, and, the, selection, of, the, best, rock, strata, through, which, to, dig, the, geology, of, this, site, generally, consists, of, northeasterly, dipping, cretaceous, strata, part, of, the, northern, limb, of, the, wealden, boulonnais, dome, characteristics, include, on, the, english, side, the, stratum, dip, is, less, than, 5, on, the, french, side, this, increases, to, 20, jointing, and, faulting, are, present, on, both, sides, on, the, english, side, only, minor, faults, of, displacement, less, than, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, exist, on, the, french, side, displacements, of, up, to, 15, metres, 49, ft, 3, in, are, present, owing, to, the, quenocs, anticlinal, fold, the, faults, are, of, limited, width, filled, with, calcite, pyrite, and, remolded, clay, the, increased, dip, and, faulting, restricted, the, selection, of, routes, on, the, french, side, to, avoid, confusion, microfossil, assemblages, were, used, to, classify, the, chalk, marl, on, the, french, side, particularly, near, the, coast, the, chalk, was, harder, more, brittle, and, more, fractured, than, on, the, english, side, this, led, to, the, adoption, of, different, tunnelling, techniques, on, the, two, sides, the, quaternary, undersea, valley, fosse, dangeard, and, castle, hill, landslip, at, the, english, portal, caused, concerns, identified, by, the, 1964, 65, geophysical, survey, the, fosse, dangeard, is, an, infilled, valley, system, extending, 80, metres, 262, ft, below, the, seabed, 500, metres, 1, 640, ft, south, of, the, tunnel, route, in, mid, channel, a, 1986, survey, showed, that, a, tributary, crossed, the, path, of, the, tunnel, and, so, the, tunnel, route, was, made, as, far, north, and, deep, as, possible, the, english, terminal, had, to, be, located, in, the, castle, hill, landslip, which, consists, of, displaced, and, tipping, blocks, of, lower, chalk, glauconitic, marl, and, gault, debris, thus, the, area, was, stabilised, by, buttressing, and, inserting, drainage, adits, the, service, tunnel, acted, as, a, pilot, preceding, the, main, ones, so, that, the, geology, areas, of, crushed, rock, and, zones, of, high, water, inflow, could, be, predicted, exploratory, probing, was, done, in, the, service, tunnel, in, the, form, of, extensive, forward, probing, vertical, downward, probes, and, sideways, probing, marine, soundings, and, samplings, were, made, by, thom, de, gamond, in, 1833, 67, establishing, the, seabed, depth, at, a, maximum, of, 55, metres, 180, ft, and, the, continuity, of, geological, strata, layers, surveying, continued, for, many, years, with, 166, marine, and, 70, land, deep, boreholes, being, drilled, and, more, than, 4, 000, line, kilometres, of, the, marine, geophysical, survey, completed, surveys, were, undertaken, in, 1958, 1959, 1964, 1965, 1972, 1974, and, 1986, 1988, the, surveying, in, 1958, 59, catered, for, immersed, tube, and, bridge, designs, as, well, as, a, bored, tunnel, and, thus, a, wide, area, was, investigated, at, this, time, marine, geophysics, surveying, for, engineering, projects, was, in, its, infancy, with, poor, positioning, and, resolution, from, seismic, profiling, the, 1964, 65, surveys, concentrated, on, a, northerly, route, that, left, the, english, coast, at, dover, harbour, using, 70, boreholes, an, area, of, deeply, weathered, rock, with, high, permeability, was, located, just, south, of, dover, harbour, given, the, previous, survey, results, and, access, constraints, a, more, southerly, route, was, investigated, in, the, 1972, 73, survey, and, the, route, was, confirmed, to, be, feasible, information, for, the, tunnelling, project, also, came, from, work, before, the, 1975, cancellation, on, the, french, side, at, sangatte, a, deep, shaft, with, adits, was, made, on, the, english, side, at, shakespeare, cliff, the, government, allowed, 250, metres, 820, ft, of, 4, 5, metre, 15, ft, diameter, tunnel, to, be, driven, the, actual, tunnel, alignment, method, of, excavation, and, support, were, essentially, the, same, as, the, 1975, attempt, in, the, 1986, 87, survey, previous, findings, were, reinforced, and, the, characteristics, of, the, gault, clay, and, the, tunnelling, medium, chalk, marl, that, made, up, 85, of, the, route, were, investigated, geophysical, techniques, from, the, oil, industry, were, employed, tunnelling, was, a, major, engineering, challenge, with, the, only, precedent, being, the, undersea, seikan, tunnel, in, japan, which, opened, in, 1988, a, serious, health, and, safety, risk, with, building, tunnels, underwater, is, major, water, inflow, due, to, the, high, hydrostatic, pressure, from, the, sea, above, under, weak, ground, conditions, the, tunnel, also, had, the, challenge, of, time, being, privately, funded, an, early, financial, return, was, paramount, the, objective, was, to, construct, two, 7, 6, metre, diameter, 25, ft, rail, tunnels, 30, metres, 98, ft, apart, 50, kilometres, 31, mi, in, length, a, 4, 8, metre, diameter, 16, ft, service, tunnel, between, the, two, main, ones, pairs, of, 3, 3, metre, 10, ft, 10, in, diameter, cross, passages, linking, the, rail, tunnels, to, the, service, one, at, 375, metre, 1, 230, ft, spacing, piston, relief, ducts, 2, metres, 6, ft, 7, in, in, diameter, connecting, the, rail, tunnels, 250, metres, 820, ft, apart, two, undersea, crossover, caverns, to, connect, the, rail, tunnels, with, the, service, tunnel, always, preceding, the, main, ones, by, at, least, 1, kilometre, 0, 6, mi, to, ascertain, the, ground, conditions, there, was, plenty, of, experience, with, excavating, through, chalk, in, the, mining, industry, while, the, undersea, crossover, caverns, were, a, complex, engineering, problem, the, french, one, was, based, on, the, mount, baker, ridge, freeway, tunnel, in, seattle, the, uk, cavern, was, dug, from, the, service, tunnel, ahead, of, the, main, ones, to, avoid, delay, precast, segmental, linings, in, the, main, tbm, drives, were, used, but, two, different, solutions, were, used, on, the, french, side, neoprene, and, grout, sealed, bolted, linings, made, of, cast, iron, or, high, strength, reinforced, concrete, were, used, on, the, english, side, the, main, requirement, was, for, speed, so, bolting, of, cast, iron, lining, segments, was, only, done, in, areas, of, poor, geology, in, the, uk, rail, tunnels, eight, lining, segments, plus, a, key, segment, were, used, in, the, french, side, five, segments, plus, a, key, on, the, french, side, a, 55, metre, 180, ft, diameter, 75, metre, 246, ft, deep, grout, curtained, shaft, at, sangatte, was, used, for, access, on, the, english, side, a, marshalling, area, was, 140, metres, 459, ft, below, the, top, of, shakespeare, cliff, the, new, austrian, tunnelling, method, natm, was, first, applied, in, the, chalk, marl, here, on, the, english, side, the, land, tunnels, were, driven, from, shakespeare, cliff, the, same, place, as, the, marine, tunnels, not, from, folkestone, the, platform, at, the, base, of, the, cliff, was, not, large, enough, for, all, of, the, drives, and, despite, environmental, objections, tunnel, spoil, was, placed, behind, a, reinforced, concrete, seawall, on, condition, of, placing, the, chalk, in, an, enclosed, lagoon, to, avoid, wide, dispersal, of, chalk, fines, owing, to, limited, space, the, precast, lining, factory, was, on, the, isle, of, grain, in, the, thames, estuary, which, used, scottish, granite, aggregate, delivered, by, ship, from, the, foster, yeoman, coastal, super, quarry, at, glensanda, in, loch, linnhe, on, the, west, coast, of, scotland, on, the, french, side, owing, to, the, greater, permeability, to, water, earth, pressure, balance, tbms, with, open, and, closed, modes, was, used, the, tbms, were, of, a, closed, nature, during, the, initial, 5, kilometres, 3, mi, but, then, operated, as, open, boring, through, the, chalk, marl, stratum, this, minimised, the, impact, to, the, ground, allowed, high, water, pressures, to, be, withstood, and, it, also, alleviated, the, need, to, grout, ahead, of, the, tunnel, the, french, effort, required, five, tbms, two, main, marine, machines, one, mainland, machine, the, short, land, drives, of, 3, km, 2, mi, allowed, one, tbm, to, complete, the, first, drive, then, reverse, direction, and, complete, the, other, and, two, service, tunnel, machines, on, the, english, side, the, simpler, geology, allowed, faster, open, faced, tbms, six, machines, were, used, all, commenced, digging, from, shakespeare, cliff, three, marine, bound, and, three, for, the, land, tunnels, towards, the, completion, of, the, undersea, drives, the, uk, tbms, were, driven, steeply, downwards, and, buried, clear, of, the, tunnel, these, buried, tbms, were, then, used, to, provide, an, electrical, earth, the, french, tbms, then, completed, the, tunnel, and, were, dismantled, a, 900, mm, 35, in, gauge, railway, was, used, on, the, english, side, during, construction, in, contrast, to, the, english, machines, which, were, given, technical, names, the, french, tunnelling, machines, were, all, named, after, women, brigitte, europa, catherine, virginie, pascaline, s, verine, at, the, end, of, the, tunnelling, one, machine, was, on, display, at, the, side, of, the, m20, motorway, in, folkestone, until, eurotunnel, sold, it, on, ebay, for, 39, 999, to, a, scrap, metal,

and, nord, pas, de, calais, would, have, increased, traffic, volumes, due, to, the, general, growth, of, cross, channel, traffic, and, traffic, attracted, by, the, tunnel, in, kent, a, high, speed, rail, line, to, london, would, transfer, traffic, from, road, to, rail, kent, s, regional, development, would, benefit, from, the, tunnel, but, being, so, close, to, london, restricts, the, benefits, gains, are, in, the, traditional, industries, and, are, largely, dependent, on, the, development, of, ashford, international, railway, station, without, which, kent, would, be, dependent, totally, on, london, s, expansion, nord, pas, de, calais, enjoys, a, strong, internal, symbolic, effect, of, the, tunnel, which, results, in, significant, gains, in, manufacturing, the, removal, of, a, bottleneck, by, means, like, the, tunnel, does, not, necessarily, induce, economic, gains, in, all, adjacent, regions, the, image, of, a, region, being, connected, to, european, high, speed, transport, and, active, political, response, is, more, important, for, regional, economic, development, some, small, medium, enterprises, located, in, the, immediate, vicinity, of, the, terminal, have, used, the, opportunity, to, re, brand, the, profile, of, their, business, with, positive, effects, such, as, the, new, inn, at, etchinghill, which, was, able, to, commercially, exploit, its, unique, selling, point, as, being, the, closest, pub, to, the, channel, tunnel, tunnel, induced, regional, development, is, small, compared, to, general, economic, growth, the, south, east, of, england, is, likely, to, benefit, developmentally, and, socially, from, faster, and, cheaper, transport, to, continental, europe, but, the, benefits, are, unlikely, to, be, distributed, equally, throughout, the, region, the, overall, environmental, effect, is, almost, certainly, negative, since, the, opening, of, the, tunnel, small, positive, effects, on, the, wider, economy, have, been, felt, but, it, is, difficult, to, identify, major, economic, successes, attributed, directly, to, the, tunnel, the, eurotunnel, does, operate, profitably, offering, an, alternative, transportation, mode, unaffected, by, poor, weather, high, costs, of, construction, did, delay, profitability, however, and, companies, involved, in, the, tunnel, s, construction, and, operation, early, in, operation, relied, on, government,

international, press, attention, and, by, 1999, the, french, red, cross, opened, the, first, migrant, centre, at, sangatte, using, a, warehouse, once, used, for, tunnel, construction, by, 2002, it, housed, up, to, 1, 500, people, at, a, time, most, of, them, trying, to, get, to, the, uk, in, 2001, most, came, from, afghanistan, iraq, and, iran, but, african, countries, were, also, represented, eurotunnel, the, company, that, operates, the, crossing, said, that, more, than, 37, 000, migrants, were, intercepted, between, january, and, july, 2015, approximately, 3, 000, migrants, mainly, from, ethiopia, eritrea, sudan, and, afghanistan, were, living, in, the, temporary, camps, erected, in, calais, at, the, time, of, an, official, count, in, july, 2015, an, estimated, 3, 000, to, 5, 000,

length, of, one, of, the, tunnels, he, was, arrested, close, to, the, british, side, after, having, walked, about, 30, miles, 48, km, through, the, tunnel, there, have, been, three, fires, in, the, tunnel, all, on, the, heavy, goods, vehicle, hgv, shuttles, that, were, significant, enough, to, close, the, tunnel, as, well, as, other, minor, incidents, on, 9, december, 1994, during, an, invitation, only, testing, phase, a, fire, broke, out, in, a, ford, escort, car, while, its, owner, was, loading, it, onto, the, upper, deck, of, a, tourist, shuttle, the, fire, started, at, about, 10, 00, with, the, shuttle, train, stationary, in, the, folkestone, terminal, and, was, put, out, about, 40, minutes, later, with, no, passenger, injuries, on, 18, november, 1996, a, fire, broke, out, on, an, hgv, shuttle, wagon, in, the, tunnel, but, nobody, was, hurt, seriously, the, exact, cause, is, unknown, although, it, was, neither, a, eurotunnel, equipment, nor, rolling, stock, problem, it, may, have, been, due, to, arson, of, a, heavy, goods, vehicle, it, is, estimated, that, the, heart, of, the, fire, reached, 1, 000, c, 1, 800, f, with, the, tunnel, severely, damaged, over, 46,
