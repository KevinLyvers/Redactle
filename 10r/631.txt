the, mauna, kea, observatories, mko, are, a, group, of, independent, astronomical, research, facilities, and, large, telescope, observatories, that, are, located, at, the, summit, of, mauna, kea, on, the, big, island, of, hawai, i, united, states, the, facilities, are, located, in, a, 525, acre, 212, ha, special, land, use, zone, known, as, the, astronomy, precinct, which, is, located, within, the, 11, 228, acre, 4, 544, ha, mauna, kea, science, reserve, the, astronomy, precinct, was, established, in, 1967, and, is, located, on, land, protected, by, the, historical, preservation, act, for, its, significance, to, hawaiian, culture, the, presence, and, continued, construction, of, telescopes, is, highly, controversial, due, to, mauna, kea, s, centrality, in, native, hawaiian, religion, and, culture, as, well, as, for, a, variety, of, environmental, reasons, the, location, is, near, ideal, because, of, its, dark, skies, from, lack, of, light, pollution, good, astronomical, seeing, low, humidity, high, elevation, of, 4, 205, meters, 13, 796, ft, position, above, most, of, the, water, vapor, in, the, atmosphere, clean, air, good, weather, and, low, latitude, location, significantly, predating, the, current, observatories, there, is, evidence, of, active, astronomy, on, mauna, kea, in, the, 1901, land, office, map, of, the, island, of, hawaii, showing, the, hawaii, astronomy, station, near, the, mauna, kea, summit, after, studying, photos, for, nasa, s, apollo, program, that, contained, greater, detail, than, any, ground, based, telescope, gerard, kuiper, began, seeking, an, arid, site, for, infrared, studies, while, he, first, began, looking, in, chile, he, also, made, the, decision, to, perform, tests, in, the, hawaiian, islands, tests, on, maui, s, haleakal, were, promising, but, the, mountain, was, too, low, in, the, inversion, layer, and, often, covered, by, clouds, on, the, big, island, of, hawai, i, mauna, kea, is, considered, the, second, highest, island, mountain, in, the, world, while, the, summit, is, often, covered, with, snow, the, air, is, extremely, dry, kuiper, began, looking, into, the, possibility, of, an, observatory, on, mauna, kea, after, testing, he, discovered, the, low, humidity, was, perfect, for, infrared, signals, he, persuaded, hawai, i, governor, john, a, burns, to, bulldoze, a, dirt, road, to, the, summit, where, he, built, a, small, telescope, on, pu, u, poli, ahu, a, cinder, cone, peak, the, peak, was, the, second, highest, on, the, mountain, with, the, highest, peak, being, holy, ground, so, kuiper, avoided, it, 25, next, kuiper, tried, enlisting, nasa, to, fund, a, larger, facility, with, a, large, telescope, housing, and, other, needed, structures, nasa, in, turn, decided, to, make, the, project, open, to, competition, professor, of, physics, john, jefferies, of, the, university, of, hawaii, placed, a, bid, on, behalf, of, the, university, jefferies, had, gained, his, reputation, through, observations, at, sacramento, peak, observatory, the, proposal, was, for, a, two, meter, telescope, to, serve, both, the, needs, of, nasa, and, the, university, while, large, telescopes, are, not, ordinarily, awarded, to, universities, without, well, established, astronomers, jefferies, and, uh, were, awarded, the, nasa, contract, infuriating, kuiper, who, felt, that, his, mountain, had, been, stolen, from, him, kuiper, would, abandon, his, site, the, very, first, telescope, on, mauna, kea, over, the, competition, and, begin, work, in, arizona, on, a, different, nasa, project, after, considerable, testing, by, jefferies, team, the, best, locations, were, determined, to, be, near, the, summit, at, the, top, of, the, cinder, cones, testing, also, determined, mauna, kea, to, be, superb, for, nighttime, viewing, due, to, many, factors, including, the, thin, air, constant, trade, winds, and, being, surrounded, by, sea, jefferies, would, build, a, 2, 24, meter, telescope, with, the, state, of, hawai, i, agreeing, to, build, a, reliable, all, weather, roadway, to, the, summit, building, began, in, 1967, and, first, light, was, seen, in, 1970, other, groups, began, requesting, subleases, on, the, newly, accessible, mountaintop, by, 1970, two, 24, in, 0, 6, m, telescopes, had, been, constructed, by, the, united, states, air, force, and, lowell, observatory, in, 1973, canada, and, france, agreed, to, build, the, 3, 6, m, cfht, on, mauna, kea, however, local, organizations, started, to, raise, concerns, about, the, environmental, impact, of, the, observatory, this, led, the, department, of, land, and, natural, resources, to, prepare, an, initial, management, plan, drafted, in, 1977, and, supplemented, in, 1980, in, january, 1982, the, university, of, hawai, i, board, of, regents, approved, a, plan, to, support, the, continued, development, of, scientific, facilities, at, the, site, in, 1998, 2, 033, acres, 823, ha, were, transferred, from, the, observatory, lease, to, supplement, the, mauna, kea, ice, age, reserve, the, 1982, plan, was, replaced, in, 2000, by, an, extension, designed, to, serve, until, 2020, it, instituted, an, office, of, mauna, kea, management, designated, 525, acres, 212, ha, for, astronomy, and, shifted, the, remaining, 10, 763, acres, 4, 356, ha, to, natural, and, cultural, preservation, this, plan, was, further, revised, to, address, concern, expressed, in, the, hawaiian, community, that, a, lack, of, respect, was, being, shown, toward, the, cultural, value, the, mountain, embodied, to, the, region, s, indigenous, people, as, of, 2012, the, mauna, kea, science, reserve, has, 13, observation, facilities, each, funded, by, as, many, as, 11, countries, it, is, one, of, the, world, s, premier, observatories, for, optical, infrared, and, submillimeter, astronomy, and, in, 2009, was, the, largest, measured, by, light, gathering, power, there, are, nine, telescopes, working, in, the, visible, and, infrared, spectrum, three, in, the, submillimeter, spectrum, and, one, in, the, radio, spectrum, with, mirrors, or, dishes, ranging, from, 0, 9, to, 25, m, 3, to, 82, ft, in, comparison, the, hubble, space, telescope, has, a, 2, 4, m, 7, 9, ft, mirror, similar, in, size, to, the, uh88, now, the, second, smallest, telescope, on, the, mountain, planned, new, telescopes, including, the, thirty, meter, telescope, have, attracted, controversy, due, to, their, potential, cultural, and, ecological, impact, the, multi, telescope, outrigger, extension, to, the, keck, telescopes, which, required, new, sites, was, eventually, canceled, three, or, four, of, the, mountain, s, 13, existing, telescopes, must, be, dismantled, over, the, next, decade, with, the, tmt, proposal, to, be, the, last, area, on, mauna, kea, on, which, any, telescope, would, ever, be, built, with, all, the, controversy, the, building, of, telescopes, has, led, to, the, creation, of, the, hawaii, night, sky, protection, act, as, artificial, light, forms, a, light, cloud, above, the, land, the, excess, light, disrupts, the, clear, pictures, taken, by, the, telescopes, on, july, 1, 2013, the, hawaii, night, sky, protection, act, was, initiated, affecting, both, the, big, island, and, maui, a, large, difference, between, the, hawaiian, islands, and, the, mainland, united, states, can, be, observed, street, lighting, almost, all, streets, are, dark, as, the, lamps, have, either, not, been, built, have, been, removed, or, have, been, dimmed, the, mauna, kea, observatories, involves, thirteen, large, telescopes, in, november, 2020, in, collaboration, with, europe, s, low, frequency, array, radio, telescope, mauna, kea, s, gemini, observatory, and, the, nasa, infrared, telescope, facility, nitf, discovered, the, first, super, planet, in, october, 2011, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, was, awarded, to, saul, perlmutter, brian, p, schmidt, and, adam, g, riess, the, prize, recognized, their, findings, based, on, research, on, supernovae, at, the, observatories, that, dark, energy, is, a, force, causing, the, universe, to, expand, at, an, accelerating, rate, the, reserve, was, established, in, 1968, and, is, leased, by, the, state, of, hawai, i, s, department, of, land, and, natural, resources, dlnr, the, university, of, hawai, i, manages, the, site, and, leases, land, to, several, multi, national, facilities, which, have, invested, more, than, 2, billion, in, science, and, technology, the, lease, expires, in, 2033, and, after, that, 40, of, 45, square, kilometers, 25, of, 28, square, miles, revert, to, the, state, of, hawaii, currently, pressure, has, been, placed, on, the, university, based, management, locals, never, agreed, to, thirteen, telescopes, atop, the, mountain, and, demand, a, say, in, the, legislation, process, house, bill, 2024, pushes, for, new, stewardship, on, the, summit, the, area, will, be, integrated, in, terms, of, management, some, land, will, be, jurisdicted, by, the, local, community, the, bill, pushes, for, future, laws, and, regulations, in, terms, of, new, building, as, always, the, cultural, and, environmental, sites, will, be, heavily, recognized, as, a, factor, for, consideration, the, altitude, and, isolation, in, the, middle, of, the, pacific, ocean, makes, mauna, kea, one, of, the, best, locations, on, earth, for, ground, based, astronomy, it, is, an, ideal, location, for, submillimeter, infrared, and, optical, observations, the, seeing, statistics, show, that, mauna, kea, is, the, best, site, in, terms, of, optical, and, infrared, image, quality, for, example, the, cfht, site, has, a, median, seeing, of, 0, 43, arcseconds, accommodations, for, research, astronomers, are, located, at, the, onizuka, center, for, international, astronomy, often, called, hale, p, haku, 7, miles, 11, km, by, unpaved, steep, road, from, the, summit, at, 9, 300, feet, 2, 800, m, above, sea, level, an, adjacent, visitor, information, station, is, located, at, 9, 200, feet, 2, 800, m, the, summit, of, mauna, kea, is, so, high, that, tourists, are, advised, to, stop, at, the, visitor, station, for, at, least, 30, minutes, to, acclimate, to, atmospheric, conditions, before, continuing, to, the, summit, and, scientists, often, stay, at, hale, p, haku, for, eight, hours, or, more, before, spending, a, full, night, at, observatories, on, the, summit, with, some, telescopes, requiring, observers, to, spend, one, full, night, at, hale, p, haku, before, working, at, the, summit, telescopes, found, at, the, summit, of, mauna, kea, are, funded, by, government, agencies, of, various, nations, the, university, of, hawai, i, directly, administers, two, telescopes, in, total, there, are, twelve, facilities, housing, thirteen, telescopes, at, or, around, the, summit, of, mauna, kea, cso, ukirt, and, hoku, kea, are, scheduled, for, decommissioning, as, part, of, the, mauna, kea, comprehensive, management, plan, in, honolulu, the, governor, and, legislature, enthusiastic, about, the, development, set, aside, an, even, larger, area, for, the, observatory, after, the, initial, project, causing, opposition, on, the, big, island, in, the, city, of, hilo, native, hawaiians, k, naka, iwi, believed, the, entire, site, was, sacred, and, that, developing, the, mountain, even, for, science, would, spoil, the, area, environmentalists, were, concerned, about, rare, native, bird, populations, and, other, citizens, of, hilo, were, concerned, about, the, sight, of, the, domes, from, the, city, using, town, hall, meetings, jefferies, was, able, to, overcome, opposition, by, weighing, the, economic, advantage, and, prestige, the, island, would, receive, there, has, been, substantial, opposition, to, the, mauna, kea, observatories, that, continues, to, grow, over, the, years, the, opposition, to, the, observatories, may, have, become, the, most, visible, example, of, the, conflict, science, has, encountered, over, access, and, use, of, environmental, and, culturally, significant, sites, opposition, to, development, grew, shortly, after, expansion, of, the, observatories, commenced, once, access, was, opened, up, by, the, roadway, to, the, summit, skiers, began, using, it, for, recreation, and, objected, when, the, road, was, closed, as, a, precaution, against, vandalism, when, the, telescopes, were, being, built, hunters, voiced, concerns, as, did, the, hawaiian, audubon, society, who, were, supported, by, governor, george, ariyoshi, 56, the, audubon, society, objected, to, further, development, on, mauna, kea, over, concerns, to, habitat, of, the, endangered, palila, a, species, endemic, to, only, specific, parts, of, this, mountain, the, bird, is, the, last, of, the, finch, billed, honeycreepers, existing, on, the, island, over, 50, of, native, bird, species, had, been, killed, off, due, to, loss, of, habitat, from, early, western, settlers, or, the, introduction, of, non, native, species, competing, for, resources, hunters, and, sportsmen, were, concerned, that, the, hunting, of, feral, animals, would, be, affected, by, the, telescope, operations, a, save, mauna, kea, movement, was, inspired, by, the, proliferation, of, telescopes, with, opposition, believing, development, of, the, mountain, to, be, sacrilegious, native, hawaiian, non, profit, groups, such, as, kahea, whose, goals, are, the, protection, of, cultural, heritage, and, the, environment, oppose, development, on, mauna, kea, as, a, sacred, space, to, the, hawaiian, religion, the, land, is, protected, by, the, united, states, historical, preservation, act, due, to, its, significance, to, hawaiian, culture, but, still, allowed, development, a, number, of, the, telescopes, sustained, minor, damage, during, the, october, 15, 2006, kiholo, bay, earthquake, and, aftershocks, jcmt, was, performing, an, inclinometry, run, and, recorded, the, earthquake, on, its, tilt, sensors, both, cfht, and, w, m, keck, observatory, were, operational, and, back, online, by, october, 19
