https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang
a, boomerang, b, u, m, r, is, a, thrown, tool, typically, constructed, with, airfoil, sections, and, designed, to, spin, about, an, axis, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, its, flight, a, returning, boomerang, is, designed, to, return, to, the, thrower, while, a, non, returning, boomerang, is, designed, as, a, weapon, to, be, thrown, straight, and, is, traditionally, used, by, some, aboriginal, australians, for, hunting, historically, boomerangs, have, been, used, for, hunting, sport, and, entertainment, and, are, made, in, various, shapes, and, sizes, to, suit, different, purposes, although, considered, an, australian, icon, ancient, boomerangs, have, also, been, discovered, in, egypt, the, americas, and, eurasia, a, boomerang, is, a, throwing, stick, with, aerodynamic, properties, traditionally, made, of, wood, but, also, of, bone, horn, tusks, and, even, iron, modern, boomerangs, used, for, sport, can, be, made, from, plywood, or, plastics, such, as, abs, polypropylene, phenolic, paper, or, carbon, fibre, reinforced, plastics, boomerangs, come, in, many, shapes, and, sizes, depending, on, their, geographic, or, tribal, origins, and, intended, function, including, the, traditional, australian, type, the, cross, stick, the, pinwheel, the, tumble, stick, the, boomabird, and, other, less, common, types, boomerangs, return, to, the, thrower, distinguishing, them, from, throwing, sticks, the, origin, of, the, term, is, uncertain, one, source, asserts, that, the, term, entered, the, language, in, 1827, adapted, from, an, extinct, aboriginal, language, of, new, south, wales, australia, but, mentions, a, variant, wo, mur, rang, which, it, dates, to, 1798, the, first, recorded, encounter, with, a, boomerang, by, europeans, was, at, farm, cove, port, jackson, in, december, 1804, when, a, weapon, was, witnessed, during, a, tribal, skirmish, the, white, spectators, were, justly, astonished, at, the, dexterity, and, incredible, force, with, which, a, bent, edged, waddy, resembling, slightly, a, turkish, scimytar, was, thrown, by, bungary, a, native, distinguished, by, his, remarkable, courtesy, the, weapon, thrown, at, 20, or, 30, yards, distance, twirled, round, in, the, air, with, astonishing, velocity, and, alighting, on, the, right, arm, of, one, of, his, opponents, actually, rebounded, to, a, distance, not, less, than, 70, or, 80, yards, leaving, a, horrible, contusion, behind, and, exciting, universal, admiration, david, collins, listed, wo, mur, r, ng, as, one, of, eight, aboriginal, names, of, clubs, in, 1798, but, was, probably, referring, to, the, woomera, which, is, actually, a, spear, thrower, an, anonymous, 1790, manuscript, on, aboriginal, languages, of, new, south, wales, reported, boo, mer, rit, as, the, scimiter, in, 1822, it, was, described, in, detail, and, recorded, as, a, bou, mar, rang, in, the, language, of, the, turuwal, people, a, sub, group, of, the, darug, of, the, georges, river, near, port, jackson, the, turawal, used, other, words, for, their, hunting, sticks, but, used, boomerang, to, refer, to, a, returning, throw, stick, boomerangs, were, historically, used, as, hunting, weapons, percussive, musical, instruments, battle, clubs, fire, starters, decoys, for, hunting, waterfowl, and, as, recreational, play, toys, the, smallest, boomerang, may, be, less, than, 10, cm, 3, 9, in, from, tip, to, tip, and, the, largest, over, 180, cm, 71, in, in, length, tribal, boomerangs, may, be, inscribed, or, painted, with, designs, meaningful, to, their, makers, most, boomerangs, seen, today, are, of, the, tourist, or, competition, sort, and, are, almost, invariably, of, the, returning, type, depictions, of, boomerangs, being, thrown, at, animals, such, as, kangaroos, appear, in, some, of, the, oldest, rock, art, in, the, world, the, indigenous, australian, rock, art, of, the, kimberley, region, which, is, potentially, up, to, 50, 000, years, old, stencils, and, paintings, of, boomerangs, also, appear, in, the, rock, art, of, west, papua, including, on, bird, s, head, peninsula, and, kaimana, likely, dating, to, the, last, glacial, maximum, when, lower, sea, levels, led, to, cultural, continuity, between, papua, and, arnhem, land, in, northern, australia, the, oldest, surviving, australian, aboriginal, boomerangs, come, from, a, cache, found, in, a, peat, bog, in, the, wyrie, swamp, of, south, australia, and, date, to, 10, 000, bc, although, traditionally, thought, of, as, australian, boomerangs, have, been, found, also, in, ancient, europe, egypt, and, north, america, there, is, evidence, of, the, use, of, non, returning, boomerangs, by, the, native, americans, of, california, and, arizona, and, inhabitants, of, south, india, for, killing, birds, and, rabbits, some, boomerangs, were, not, thrown, at, all, but, were, used, in, hand, to, hand, combat, by, indigenous, australians, ancient, egyptian, examples, however, have, been, recovered, and, experiments, have, shown, that, they, functioned, as, returning, boomerangs, hunting, sticks, discovered, in, europe, seem, to, have, formed, part, of, the, stone, age, arsenal, of, weapons, one, boomerang, that, was, discovered, in, ob, azowa, cave, in, the, carpathian, mountains, in, poland, was, made, of, mammoth, s, tusk, and, is, believed, based, on, ams, dating, of, objects, found, with, it, to, be, about, 30, 000, years, old, in, the, netherlands, boomerangs, have, been, found, in, vlaardingen, and, velsen, from, the, first, century, bc, king, tutankhamun, the, famous, pharaoh, of, ancient, egypt, who, died, over, 3, 300, years, ago, owned, a, collection, of, boomerangs, of, both, the, straight, flying, hunting, and, returning, variety, no, one, knows, for, sure, how, the, returning, boomerang, was, invented, but, some, modern, boomerang, makers, speculate, that, it, developed, from, the, flattened, throwing, stick, still, used, by, aboriginal, australians, and, other, indigenous, peoples, around, the, world, including, the, navajo, in, north, america, a, hunting, boomerang, is, delicately, balanced, and, much, harder, to, make, than, a, returning, one, the, curving, flight, characteristic, of, returning, boomerangs, was, probably, first, noticed, by, early, hunters, trying, to, tune, their, throwing, sticks, to, fly, straight, it, is, thought, by, some, that, the, shape, and, elliptical, flight, path, of, the, returning, boomerang, makes, it, useful, for, hunting, birds, and, small, animals, or, that, noise, generated, by, the, movement, of, the, boomerang, through, the, air, or, by, a, skilled, thrower, lightly, clipping, leaves, of, a, tree, whose, branches, house, birds, would, help, scare, the, birds, towards, the, thrower, it, is, further, supposed, by, some, that, this, was, used, to, frighten, flocks, or, groups, of, birds, into, nets, that, were, usually, strung, up, between, trees, or, thrown, by, hidden, hunters, in, southeastern, australia, it, is, claimed, that, boomerangs, were, made, to, hover, over, a, flock, of, ducks, mistaking, it, for, a, hawk, the, ducks, would, dive, away, toward, hunters, armed, with, nets, or, clubs, traditionally, most, boomerangs, used, by, aboriginal, groups, in, australia, were, non, returning, these, weapons, sometimes, called, throwsticks, or, kylies, were, used, for, hunting, a, variety, of, prey, from, kangaroos, to, parrots, at, a, range, of, about, 100, m, 330, ft, a, 2, kg, 4, 4, lb, non, returning, boomerang, could, inflict, mortal, injury, to, a, large, animal, a, throwstick, thrown, nearly, horizontally, may, fly, in, a, nearly, straight, path, and, could, fell, a, kangaroo, on, impact, to, the, legs, or, knees, while, the, long, necked, emu, could, be, killed, by, a, blow, to, the, neck, hooked, non, returning, boomerangs, known, as, beaked, kylies, used, in, northern, central, australia, have, been, claimed, to, kill, multiple, birds, when, thrown, into, a, dense, flock, throwsticks, are, used, as, multi, purpose, tools, by, today, s, aboriginal, peoples, and, besides, throwing, could, be, wielded, as, clubs, used, for, digging, used, to, start, friction, fires, and, are, sonorous, when, two, are, struck, together, recent, evidence, also, suggests, that, boomerangs, were, used, as, war, weapons, today, boomerangs, are, mostly, used, for, recreation, there, are, different, types, of, throwing, contests, accuracy, of, return, aussie, round, trick, catch, maximum, time, aloft, fast, catch, and, endurance, see, below, the, modern, sport, boomerang, often, referred, to, as, a, boom, or, rang, is, made, of, finnish, birch, plywood, hardwood, plastic, or, composite, materials, and, comes, in, many, different, shapes, and, colours, most, sport, boomerangs, typically, weigh, less, than, 100, g, 3, 5, oz, with, mta, boomerangs, boomerangs, used, for, the, maximum, time, aloft, event, often, under, 25, g, 0, 88, oz, boomerangs, have, also, been, suggested, as, an, alternative, to, clay, pigeons, in, shotgun, sports, where, the, flight, of, the, boomerang, better, mimics, the, flight, of, a, bird, offering, a, more, challenging, target, the, modern, boomerang, is, often, computer, aided, designed, with, precision, airfoils, the, number, of, wings, is, often, more, than, 2, as, more, lift, is, provided, by, 3, or, 4, wings, than, by, 2, among, the, latest, inventions, is, a, round, shaped, boomerang, which, has, a, different, look, but, using, the, same, returning, principle, as, traditional, boomerangs, this, allows, for, safer, catch, for, players, in, 1992, german, astronaut, ulf, merbold, performed, an, experiment, aboard, spacelab, that, established, that, boomerangs, function, in, zero, gravity, as, they, do, on, earth, french, astronaut, jean, fran, ois, clervoy, aboard, mir, repeated, this, in, 1997, in, 2008, japanese, astronaut, takao, doi, again, repeated, the, experiment, on, board, the, international, space, station, beginning, in, the, later, part, of, the, twentieth, century, there, has, been, a, bloom, in, the, independent, creation, of, unusually, designed, art, boomerangs, these, often, have, little, or, no, resemblance, to, the, traditional, historical, ones, and, on, first, sight, some, of, these, objects, may, not, look, like, boomerangs, at, all, the, use, of, modern, thin, plywoods, and, synthetic, plastics, have, greatly, contributed, to, their, success, designs, are, very, diverse, and, can, range, from, animal, inspired, forms, humorous, themes, complex, calligraphic, and, symbolic, shapes, to, the, purely, abstract, painted, surfaces, are, similarly, richly, diverse, some, boomerangs, made, primarily, as, art, objects, do, not, have, the, required, aerodynamic, properties, to, return, a, returning, boomerang, is, a, rotating, wing, it, consists, of, two, or, more, arms, or, wings, connected, at, an, angle, each, wing, is, shaped, as, an, airfoil, section, although, it, is, not, a, requirement, that, a, boomerang, be, in, its, traditional, shape, it, is, usually, flat, boomerangs, can, be, made, for, right, or, left, handed, throwers, the, difference, between, right, and, left, is, subtle, the, planform, is, the, same, but, the, leading, edges, of, the, aerofoil, sections, are, reversed, a, right, handed, boomerang, makes, a, counter, clockwise, circular, flight, to, the, left, while, a, left, handed, boomerang, flies, clockwise, to, the, right, most, sport, boomerangs, weigh, between, 70, and, 110, g, 2, 5, and, 3, 9, oz, have, a, 250, 300, mm, 9, 8, 11, 8, in, wingspan, and, a, 20, 40, m, 66, 131, ft, range, a, falling, boomerang, starts, spinning, and, most, then, fall, in, a, spiral, when, the, boomerang, is, thrown, with, high, spin, a, boomerang, flies, in, a, curved, rather, than, a, straight, line, when, thrown, correctly, a, boomerang, returns, to, its, starting, point, as, the, wing, rotates, and, the, boomerang, moves, through, the, air, the, airflow, over, the, wings, creates, lift, on, both, wings, however, during, one, half, of, each, blade, s, rotation, it, sees, a, higher, airspeed, because, the, rotation, tip, speed, and, the, forward, speed, add, and, when, it, is, in, the, other, half, of, the, rotation, the, tip, speed, subtracts, from, the, forward, speed, thus, if, thrown, nearly, upright, each, blade, generates, more, lift, at, the, top, than, the, bottom, while, it, might, be, expected, that, this, would, cause, the, boomerang, to, tilt, around, the, axis, of, travel, because, the, boomerang, has, significant, angular, momentum, the, gyroscopic, precession, causes, the, plane, of, rotation, to, tilt, about, an, axis, that, is, 90, degrees, to, the, direction, of, flight, causing, it, to, turn, when, thrown, in, the, horizontal, plane, as, with, a, frisbee, instead, of, in, the, vertical, the, same, gyroscopic, precession, will, cause, the, boomerang, to, fly, violently, straight, up, into, the, air, and, then, crash, fast, catch, boomerangs, usually, have, three, or, more, symmetrical, wings, seen, from, above, whereas, a, long, distance, boomerang, is, most, often, shaped, similar, to, a, question, mark, maximum, time, aloft, boomerangs, mostly, have, one, wing, considerably, longer, than, the, other, this, feature, along, with, carefully, executed, bends, and, twists, in, the, wings, help, to, set, up, an, auto, rotation, effect, to, maximise, the, boomerang, s, hover, time, in, descending, from, the, highest, point, in, its, flight, some, boomerangs, have, turbulators, bumps, or, pits, on, the, top, surface, that, act, to, increase, the, lift, as, boundary, layer, transition, activators, to, keep, attached, turbulent, flow, instead, of, laminar, separation, boomerangs, are, generally, thrown, in, unobstructed, open, spaces, at, least, twice, as, large, as, the, range, of, the, boomerang, the, flight, direction, to, the, left, or, right, depends, upon, the, design, of, the, boomerang, itself, not, the, thrower, a, right, handed, or, left, handed, boomerang, can, be, thrown, with, either, hand, but, throwing, a, boomerang, with, the, non, matching, hand, requires, a, throwing, motion, that, many, throwers, find, awkward, the, following, technique, applies, to, a, right, handed, boomerang, the, directions, are, mirrored, for, a, left, handed, boomerang, different, boomerang, designs, have, different, flight, characteristics, and, are, suitable, for, different, conditions, the, accuracy, of, the, throw, depends, on, understanding, the, weight, and, aerodynamics, of, that, particular, boomerang, and, the, strength, consistency, and, direction, of, the, wind, from, this, the, thrower, chooses, the, angle, of, tilt, the, angle, against, the, wind, the, elevation, of, the, trajectory, the, degree, of, spin, and, the, strength, of, the, throw, a, great, deal, of, trial, and, error, is, required, to, perfect, the, throw, over, time, a, properly, thrown, boomerang, will, travel, out, parallel, to, the, ground, sometimes, climbing, gently, perform, a, graceful, anti, clockwise, circular, or, tear, drop, shaped, arc, flatten, out, and, return, in, a, hovering, motion, coming, in, from, the, left, or, spiralling, in, from, behind, ideally, the, hover, will, allow, a, practiced, catcher, to, clamp, their, hands, shut, horizontally, on, the, boomerang, from, above, and, below, sandwiching, the, centre, between, their, hands, the, grip, used, depends, on, size, and, shape, smaller, boomerangs, are, held, between, finger, and, thumb, at, one, end, while, larger, heavier, or, wider, boomerangs, need, one, or, two, fingers, wrapped, over, the, top, edge, in, order, to, induce, a, spin, the, aerofoil, shaped, section, must, face, the, inside, of, the, thrower, and, the, flatter, side, outwards, it, is, usually, inclined, outwards, from, a, nearly, vertical, position, to, 20, or, 30, the, stronger, the, wind, the, closer, to, vertical, the, elbow, of, the, boomerang, can, point, forwards, or, backwards, or, it, can, be, gripped, for, throwing, it, just, needs, to, start, spinning, on, the, required, inclination, in, the, desired, direction, with, the, right, force, the, boomerang, is, aimed, to, the, right, of, the, oncoming, wind, the, exact, angle, depends, on, the, strength, of, the, wind, and, the, boomerang, itself, left, handed, boomerangs, are, thrown, to, the, left, of, the, wind, and, will, fly, a, clockwise, flight, path, the, trajectory, is, either, parallel, to, the, ground, or, slightly, upwards, the, boomerang, can, return, without, the, aid, of, any, wind, but, even, very, slight, winds, must, be, taken, into, account, however, calm, they, might, seem, little, or, no, wind, is, preferable, for, an, accurate, throw, light, winds, up, to, 3, 5, knots, 6, 9, km, h, 3, 6, mph, are, manageable, with, skill, if, the, wind, is, strong, enough, to, fly, a, kite, then, it, may, be, too, strong, unless, a, skilled, thrower, is, using, a, boomerang, designed, for, stability, in, stronger, winds, gusty, days, are, a, great, challenge, and, the, thrower, must, be, keenly, aware, of, the, ebb, and, flow, of, the, wind, strength, finding, appropriate, lulls, in, the, gusts, to, launch, their, boomerang, a, world, record, achievement, was, made, on, 3, june, 2007, by, tim, lendrum, in, aussie, round, lendrum, scored, 96, out, of, 100, giving, him, a, national, record, as, well, as, an, equal, world, record, throwing, an, ayr, made, by, expert, boomerang, maker, adam, carroll, in, international, competition, a, world, cup, is, held, every, second, year, as, of, 2017, teams, from, germany, and, the, united, states, dominated, international, competition, the, individual, world, champion, title, was, won, in, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2012, and, 2016, by, swiss, thrower, manuel, sch, tz, in, 1992, 1998, 2006, and, 2008, fridolin, frost, from, germany, won, the, title, the, team, competitions, of, 2012, and, 2014, were, won, by, boomergang, an, international, team, world, champions, were, germany, in, 2012, and, japan, in, 2014, for, the, first, time, boomergang, was, formed, by, individuals, from, several, countries, including, the, colombian, alejandro, palacio, in, 2016, usa, became, team, world, champion, modern, boomerang, tournaments, usually, involve, some, or, all, of, the, events, listed, below, in, all, disciplines, the, boomerang, must, travel, at, least, 20, metres, 66, ft, from, the, thrower, throwing, takes, place, individually, the, thrower, stands, at, the, centre, of, concentric, rings, marked, on, an, open, field, events, include, non, discipline, record, smallest, returning, boomerang, sadir, kattan, of, australia, in, 1997, with, 48, mm, 1, 9, in, long, and, 46, mm, 1, 8, in, wide, this, tiny, boomerang, flew, the, required, 20, m, 66, ft, before, returning, to, the, accuracy, circles, on, 22, march, 1997, at, the, australian, national, championships, a, boomerang, was, used, to, set, a, guinness, world, record, with, a, throw, of, 427, 2, m, 1, 402, ft, by, david, schummy, on, 15, march, 2005, at, murarrie, recreation, ground, australia, this, broke, the, record, set, by, erin, hemmings, who, threw, an, aerobie, 406, 3, m, 1, 333, ft, on, 14, july, 2003, at, fort, funston, san, francisco, long, distance, boomerang, throwers, aim, to, have, the, boomerang, go, the, furthest, possible, distance, while, returning, close, to, the, throwing, point, in, competition, the, boomerang, must, intersect, an, imaginary, surface, defined, as, an, infinite, vertical, projection, of, a, 40, m, 130, ft, line, centred, on, the, thrower, outside, of, competitions, the, definition, is, not, so, strict, and, throwers, may, be, happy, simply, not, to, walk, too, far, to, recover, the, boomerang, long, distance, boomerangs, are, optimised, to, have, minimal, drag, while, still, having, enough, lift, to, fly, and, return, for, this, reason, they, have, a, very, narrow, throwing, window, which, discourages, many, beginners, from, continuing, with, this, discipline, for, the, same, reason, the, quality, of, manufactured, long, distance, boomerangs, is, often, difficult, to, determine, today, s, long, distance, boomerangs, have, almost, all, an, s, or, question, mark, shape, and, have, a, beveled, edge, on, both, sides, the, bevel, on, the, bottom, side, is, sometimes, called, an, undercut, this, is, to, minimise, drag, and, lower, the, lift, lift, must, be, low, because, the, boomerang, is, thrown, with, an, almost, total, layover, flat, long, distance, boomerangs, are, most, frequently, made, of, composite, material, mainly, fibre, glass, epoxy, composites, the, projection, of, the, flight, path, of, long, distance, boomerang, on, the, ground, resembles, a, water, drop, for, older, types, of, long, distance, boomerangs, all, types, of, so, called, big, hooks, the, first, and, last, third, of, the, flight, path, are, very, low, while, the, middle, third, is, a, fast, climb, followed, by, a, fast, descent, nowadays, boomerangs, are, made, in, a, way, that, their, whole, flight, path, is, almost, planar, with, a, constant, climb, during, the, first, half, of, the, trajectory, and, then, a, rather, constant, descent, during, the, second, half, from, theoretical, point, of, view, distance, boomerangs, are, interesting, also, for, the, following, reason, for, achieving, a, different, behaviour, during, different, flight, phases, the, ratio, of, the, rotation, frequency, to, the, forward, velocity, has, a, u, shaped, function, i, e, its, derivative, crosses, 0, practically, it, means, that, the, boomerang, being, at, the, furthest, point, has, a, very, low, forward, velocity, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, forward, component, is, then, stored, in, the, potential, energy, this, is, not, true, for, other, types, of, boomerangs, where, the, loss, of, kinetic, energy, is, non, reversible, the, mtas, also, store, kinetic, energy, in, potential, energy, during, the, first, half, of, the, flight, but, then, the, potential, energy, is, lost, directly, by, the, drag, in, noongar, language, kylie, is, a, flat, curved, piece, of, wood, similar, in, appearance, to, a, boomerang, that, is, thrown, when, hunting, for, birds, and, animals, kylie, is, one, of, the, aboriginal, words, for, the, hunting, stick, used, in, warfare, and, for, hunting, animals, instead, of, following, curved, flight, paths, kylies, fly, in, straight, lines, from, the, throwers, they, are, typically, much, larger, than, boomerangs, and, can, travel, very, long, distances, due, to, their, size, and, hook, shapes, they, can, cripple, or, kill, an, animal, or, human, opponent, the, word, is, perhaps, an, english, corruption, of, a, word, meaning, boomerang, taken, from, one, of, the, western, desert, languages, for, example, the, warlpiri, word, karli, trademarks, of, australian, companies, using, the, boomerang, as, a, symbol, emblem, or, logo, proliferate, usually, removed, from, aboriginal, context, and, symbolising, returning, or, to, distinguish, an, australian, brand, early, examples, included, bain, s, white, ant, exterminator, 1896, webendorfer, bros, explosives, 1898, e, a, adams, foods, 1920, and, by, the, still, current, boomerang, cigarette, papers, pty, ltd, aboriginalia, including, the, boomerang, as, symbols, of, australia, dates, from, the, late, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, and, was, in, widespread, use, by, a, largely, european, arts, crafts, and, design, community, by, the, 1960s, the, australian, tourism, industry, extended, it, to, the, very, branding, of, australia, particularly, to, overseas, and, domestic, tourists, as, souvenirs, and, gifts, and, thus, aboriginal, culture, at, the, very, time, when, aboriginal, people, and, culture, were, subject, to, policies, that, removed, them, from, their, traditional, lands, and, sought, to, assimilate, them, physiologically, and, culturally, into, mainstream, white, australian, culture, causing, the, stolen, generations, aboriginalia, found, an, ironically, nostalgic, entry, point, into, australian, popular, culture, at, important, social, locations, holiday, resorts, and, in, australian, domestic, interiors, in, the, 21st, century, souvenir, objects, depicting, aboriginal, peoples, symbolism, and, motifs, including, the, boomerang, from, the, 1940s, 1970s, regarded, as, kitsch, and, sold, largely, to, tourists, in, the, first, instance, became, highly, sought, after, by, both, aboriginal, and, non, aboriginal, collectors, and, has, captured, the, imagination, of, aboriginal, artists, and, cultural, commentators
