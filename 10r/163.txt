industrial, engineering, is, an, engineering, profession, that, is, concerned, with, the, optimization, of, complex, processes, systems, or, organizations, by, developing, improving, and, implementing, integrated, systems, of, people, money, knowledge, information, and, equipment, industrial, engineering, is, central, to, manufacturing, operations, industrial, engineers, use, specialized, knowledge, and, skills, in, the, mathematical, physical, and, social, sciences, together, with, engineering, analysis, and, design, principles, and, methods, to, specify, predict, and, evaluate, the, results, obtained, from, systems, and, processes, several, industrial, engineering, principles, are, followed, in, the, manufacturing, industry, to, ensure, the, effective, flow, of, systems, processes, and, operations, these, include, these, principles, allow, the, creation, of, new, systems, processes, or, situations, for, the, useful, coordination, of, labor, materials, and, machines, and, also, improve, the, quality, and, productivity, of, systems, physical, or, social, depending, on, the, subspecialties, involved, industrial, engineering, may, also, overlap, with, operations, research, systems, engineering, manufacturing, engineering, production, engineering, supply, chain, engineering, management, science, engineering, management, financial, engineering, ergonomics, or, human, factors, engineering, safety, engineering, logistics, engineering, quality, engineering, or, other, related, capabilities, or, fields, there, is, a, general, consensus, among, historians, that, the, roots, of, the, industrial, engineering, profession, date, back, to, the, industrial, revolution, the, technologies, that, helped, mechanize, traditional, manual, operations, in, the, textile, industry, including, the, flying, shuttle, the, spinning, jenny, and, perhaps, most, importantly, the, steam, engine, generated, economies, of, scale, that, made, mass, production, in, centralized, locations, attractive, for, the, first, time, the, concept, of, the, production, system, had, its, genesis, in, the, factories, created, by, these, innovations, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, perhaps, leonardo, da, vinci, was, the, first, industrial, engineer, because, there, is, evidence, that, he, applied, science, to, the, analysis, of, human, work, by, examining, the, rate, at, which, a, man, could, shovel, dirt, around, the, year, 1500, others, also, state, that, the, industrial, engineering, profession, grew, from, charles, babbage, s, study, of, factory, operations, and, specifically, his, work, on, the, manufacture, of, straight, pins, in, 1832, however, it, has, been, generally, argued, that, these, early, efforts, while, valuable, were, merely, observational, and, did, not, attempt, to, engineer, the, jobs, studied, or, increase, overall, output, adam, smith, s, concepts, of, division, of, labour, and, the, invisible, hand, of, capitalism, introduced, in, his, treatise, the, wealth, of, nations, motivated, many, of, the, technological, innovators, of, the, industrial, revolution, to, establish, and, implement, factory, systems, the, efforts, of, james, watt, and, matthew, boulton, led, to, the, first, integrated, machine, manufacturing, facility, in, the, world, including, the, application, of, concepts, such, as, cost, control, systems, to, reduce, waste, and, increase, productivity, and, the, institution, of, skills, training, for, craftsmen, charles, babbage, became, associated, with, industrial, engineering, because, of, the, concepts, he, introduced, in, his, book, on, the, economy, of, machinery, and, manufacturers, which, he, wrote, as, a, result, of, his, visits, to, factories, in, england, and, the, united, states, in, the, early, 1800s, the, book, includes, subjects, such, as, the, time, required, to, perform, a, specific, task, the, effects, of, subdividing, tasks, into, smaller, and, less, detailed, elements, and, the, advantages, to, be, gained, from, repetitive, tasks, eli, whitney, and, simeon, north, proved, the, feasibility, of, the, notion, of, interchangeable, parts, in, the, manufacture, of, muskets, and, pistols, for, the, us, government, under, this, system, individual, parts, were, mass, produced, to, tolerances, to, enable, their, use, in, any, finished, product, the, result, was, a, significant, reduction, in, the, need, for, skill, from, specialized, workers, which, eventually, led, to, the, industrial, environment, to, be, studied, later, frederick, taylor, 1856, 1915, is, generally, credited, as, being, the, father, of, the, industrial, engineering, discipline, he, earned, a, degree, in, mechanical, engineering, from, stevens, institute, of, technology, and, earned, several, patents, from, his, inventions, his, books, shop, management, and, the, principles, of, scientific, management, which, were, published, in, the, early, 1900s, were, the, beginning, of, industrial, engineering, improvements, in, work, efficiency, under, his, methods, was, based, on, improving, work, methods, developing, of, work, standards, and, reduction, in, time, required, to, carry, out, the, work, with, an, abiding, faith, in, the, scientific, method, taylor, did, many, experiments, in, machine, shop, work, on, machines, as, well, as, men, taylor, developed, time, study, to, measure, time, taken, for, various, elements, of, a, task, and, then, used, the, study, observations, to, reduce, the, time, further, time, study, was, done, for, the, improved, method, once, again, to, provide, time, standards, which, are, accurate, for, planning, manual, tasks, and, also, for, providing, incentives, the, husband, and, wife, team, of, frank, gilbreth, 1868, 1924, and, lillian, gilbreth, 1878, 1972, was, the, other, cornerstone, of, the, industrial, engineering, movement, whose, work, is, housed, at, purdue, university, school, of, industrial, engineering, they, categorized, the, elements, of, human, motion, into, 18, basic, elements, called, therbligs, this, development, permitted, analysts, to, design, jobs, without, knowledge, of, the, time, required, to, do, a, job, these, developments, were, the, beginning, of, a, much, broader, field, known, as, human, factors, or, ergonomics, in, 1908, the, first, course, on, industrial, engineering, was, offered, as, an, elective, at, pennsylvania, state, university, which, became, a, separate, program, in, 1909, through, the, efforts, of, hugo, diemer, the, first, doctoral, degree, in, industrial, engineering, was, awarded, in, 1933, by, cornell, university, in, 1912, henry, laurence, gantt, developed, the, gantt, chart, which, outlines, actions, the, organization, along, with, their, relationships, this, chart, opens, later, form, familiar, to, us, today, by, wallace, clark, with, the, development, of, assembly, lines, the, factory, of, henry, ford, 1913, accounted, for, a, significant, leap, forward, in, the, field, ford, reduced, the, assembly, time, of, a, car, from, more, than, 700, hours, to, 1, 5, hours, in, addition, he, was, a, pioneer, of, the, economy, of, the, capitalist, welfare, welfare, capitalism, and, the, flag, of, providing, financial, incentives, for, employees, to, increase, productivity, in, 1927, the, then, technische, hochschule, berlin, was, the, first, german, university, to, introduce, the, degree, the, course, of, studies, developed, by, willi, prion, was, then, still, called, business, and, technology, and, was, intended, to, provide, descendants, of, industrialists, with, an, adequate, education, comprehensive, quality, management, system, total, quality, management, or, tqm, developed, in, the, forties, was, gaining, momentum, after, world, war, ii, and, was, part, of, the, recovery, of, japan, after, the, war, the, american, institute, of, industrial, engineering, was, formed, in, 1948, the, early, work, by, f, w, taylor, and, the, gilbreths, was, documented, in, papers, presented, to, the, american, society, of, mechanical, engineers, as, interest, grew, from, merely, improving, machine, performance, to, the, performance, of, the, overall, manufacturing, process, most, notably, starting, with, the, presentation, by, henry, r, towne, 1844, 1924, of, his, paper, the, engineer, as, an, economist, 1886, from, 1960, to, 1975, with, the, development, of, decision, support, systems, in, supply, such, as, material, requirements, planning, mrp, one, can, emphasize, the, timing, issue, inventory, production, compounding, transportation, etc, of, industrial, organization, israeli, scientist, dr, jacob, rubinovitz, installed, the, cmms, program, developed, in, iai, and, control, data, israel, in, 1976, in, south, africa, and, worldwide, in, the, 1970s, with, the, penetration, of, japanese, management, theories, such, as, kaizen, and, kanban, japan, realized, very, high, levels, of, quality, and, productivity, these, theories, improved, issues, of, quality, delivery, time, and, flexibility, companies, in, the, west, realized, the, great, impact, of, kaizen, and, started, implementing, their, own, continuous, improvement, programs, w, edwards, deming, made, significant, contributions, in, the, minimization, of, variance, starting, in, the, 1950s, and, continuing, to, the, end, of, his, life, in, the, 1990s, following, the, global, industry, globalization, process, the, emphasis, was, on, supply, chain, management, and, customer, oriented, business, process, design, the, theory, of, constraints, developed, by, israeli, scientist, eliyahu, m, goldratt, 1985, is, also, a, significant, milestone, in, the, field, engineering, is, traditionally, decompositional, to, understand, the, whole, of, something, it, is, first, broken, down, into, its, parts, one, masters, the, parts, then, puts, them, back, together, to, create, a, better, understanding, of, how, to, master, the, whole, the, approach, of, industrial, and, systems, engineering, ise, is, opposite, any, one, part, cannot, be, understood, without, the, context, of, the, whole, system, changes, in, one, part, of, the, system, affect, the, entire, system, and, the, role, of, a, single, part, is, to, better, serve, the, whole, system, also, industrial, engineering, considers, the, human, factor, and, its, relation, to, the, technical, aspect, of, the, situation, and, all, of, the, other, factors, that, influence, the, entire, situation, while, other, engineering, disciplines, focus, on, the, design, of, inanimate, objects, industrial, engineers, integrate, combinations, of, people, information, materials, and, equipment, that, produce, innovative, and, efficient, organizations, in, addition, to, manufacturing, industrial, engineers, work, and, consult, in, every, industry, including, hospitals, communications, e, commerce, entertainment, government, finance, food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, sports, insurance, sales, accounting, banking, travel, and, transportation, industrial, engineering, is, the, branch, of, engineering, most, closely, related, to, human, resources, in, that, we, apply, social, skills, to, work, with, all, types, of, employees, from, engineers, to, salespeople, to, top, management, one, of, the, main, focuses, of, an, industrial, engineer, is, to, improve, the, working, environments, of, people, not, to, change, the, worker, but, to, change, the, workplace, all, engineers, including, industrial, engineers, take, mathematics, through, calculus, and, differential, equations, industrial, engineering, is, different, in, that, it, is, based, on, discrete, variable, math, whereas, all, other, engineering, is, based, on, continuous, variable, math, we, emphasize, the, use, of, linear, algebra, and, difference, equations, as, opposed, to, the, use, of, differential, equations, which, are, so, prevalent, in, other, engineering, disciplines, this, emphasis, becomes, evident, in, optimization, of, production, systems, in, which, we, are, sequencing, orders, scheduling, batches, determining, the, number, of, materials, handling, units, arranging, factory, layouts, finding, sequences, of, motions, etc, as, industrial, engineers, we, deal, almost, exclusively, with, systems, of, discrete, components, while, originally, applied, to, manufacturing, the, use, of, industrial, in, industrial, engineering, can, be, somewhat, misleading, since, it, has, grown, to, encompass, any, methodical, or, quantitative, approach, to, optimizing, how, a, process, system, or, organization, operates, in, fact, the, industrial, in, industrial, engineering, means, the, industry, in, its, broadest, sense, people, have, changed, the, term, industrial, to, broader, terms, such, as, industrial, and, manufacturing, engineering, industrial, and, systems, engineering, industrial, engineering, and, operations, research, industrial, engineering, and, management, industrial, engineering, has, many, sub, disciplines, the, most, common, of, which, are, listed, below, although, there, are, industrial, engineers, who, focus, exclusively, on, one, of, these, sub, disciplines, many, deals, with, a, combination, of, them, such, as, supply, chain, and, logistics, and, facilities, and, energy, management, methods, engineering,

to, practice, engineering, professionally, in, any, other, universities, offer, degrees, at, the, bachelor, masters, and, doctoral, level, in, the, united, states, the, undergraduate, degree, earned, is, either, a, bachelor, of, science, b, s, or, a, bachelor, of, science, and, engineering, b, s, e, in, industrial, engineering, ie, in, south, africa, the, undergraduate, degree, is, a, bachelor, of, engineering, beng, variations, of, the, title, include, industrial, operations, engineering, ioe, and, industrial, systems, engineering, ise, or, isye, the, typical, curriculum, includes, a, broad, math, and, science, foundation, spanning, chemistry, physics, mechanics, i, e, statics, kinematics, and, dynamics, materials, science, computer, science, electronics, circuits, engineering, design, and, the, standard, range, of, engineering, mathematics, i, e, calculus, linear, algebra, differential, equations, statistics, for, any, engineering, undergraduate, program, to, be, accredited, regardless, of, concentration, it, must, cover, a, largely, similar, span, of, such, foundational, work, which, also, overlaps, heavily, with, the, content, tested, on, one, or, more, engineering, licensure, exams, in, most, jurisdictions, the, coursework, specific, to, ie, entails, specialized, courses, in, areas, such, as, optimization, applied, probability, stochastic, modeling, design, of, experiments, statistical, process, control, simulation, manufacturing, engineering, ergonomics, safety, engineering, and, engineering, economics, industrial, engineering, elective, courses, typically, cover, more, specialized, topics, in, areas, such, as, manufacturing, supply, chains, and, logistics, analytics, and, machine, learning, production, systems, human, factors, and, industrial, design, and, service, systems, certain, business, schools, may, offer, programs, with, some, overlapping, relevance, to, ie, but, the, engineering, programs, are, distinguished, by, a, much, more, intensely, quantitative, focus, required, engineering, science, electives, and, the, core, math, and, science, courses, required, of, all, engineering, programs, the, usual, graduate, degree, earned, is, the, master, of, science, ms, master, of, science, and, engineering, mse, or, master, of, engineering, meng, in, industrial, engineering, or, various, alternative, related, concentration, titles, typical, ms, curricula, may, cover, while, industrial, engineering, as, a, formal, degree, has, been, around, for, years, consensus, on, what, topics, should, be, taught, and, studied, differs, across, countries, for, example, turkey, focuses, on, a, very, technical, degree, while, denmark, finland, and, the, united, kingdom, have, a, management, focus, degree, thus, making, it, less, technical, the, united, states, meanwhile, focuses, on, case, studies, group, problem, solving, and, maintains, a, balance, between, the, technical, and, non, technical, side, traditionally, a, major, aspect, of, industrial, engineering, was, planning, the, layouts, of, factories, and, designing, assembly, lines, and, other, manufacturing, paradigms, and, now, in, lean, manufacturing, systems, industrial, engineers, work, to, eliminate, wastes, of, time, money, materials, energy, and, other, resources, examples, of, where, industrial, engineering, might, be, used, include, flow, process, charting, process, mapping, designing, an, assembly, workstation, strategizing, for, various, operational, logistics, consulting, as, an, efficiency, expert, developing, a, new, financial, algorithm, or, loan, system, for, a, bank, streamlining, operation, and, emergency, room, location, or, usage, in, a, hospital, planning, complex, distribution, schemes, for, materials, or, products, referred, to, as, supply, chain, management, and, shortening, lines, or, queues, at, a, bank, hospital, or, a, theme, park, modern, industrial, engineers, typically, use, predetermined, motion, time, systems, computer, simulation, especially, discrete, event, simulation, along, with, extensive, mathematical, tools, for, modeling, such, as, mathematical, optimization, and, queueing, theory, and, computational, methods, for, system, analysis, evaluation, and, optimization, industrial, engineers, also, use, the, tools, of, data, science, and, machine, learning, in, their, work, owing, to, the, strong, relatedness, of, these, disciplines, with, the, field, and, the, similar, technical, background, required, of, industrial, engineers, including, a, strong, foundation, in, probability, theory, linear, algebra, and, statistics, as, well, as, having, coding, skills
