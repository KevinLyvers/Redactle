that, was, opened, in, march, 2022, the, akashi, kaikyo, bridge, is, one, of, the, key, links, of, the, honsh, shikoku, bridge, project, which, created, three, routes, across, the, seto, inland, sea, the, akashi, kaikyo, bridge, forms, part, of, the, kobe, awaji, naruto, expressway, the, easternmost, route, of, the, bridge, system, linking, the, islands, of, honshu, and, shikoku, the, bridge, crosses, the, akashi, strait, width, 4, km, between, kobe, on, honshu, and, iwaya, on, awaji, island, the, other, major, part, of, the, crossing, is, completed, by, the, naruto, bridge, which, links, awaji, island, to, ge, island, across, the, naruto, strait, before, the, akashi, kaikyo, bridge, was, built, ferries, carried, passengers, across, the, akashi, strait, a, major, passageway, for, shipping, it, is, also, known, for, its, gales, heavy, rain, storms, and, other, natural, disasters, the, sekirei, maru, sinking, in, 1945, which, killed, 304, people, first, stirred, public, discussion, on, the, possibility, of, a, bridge, over, the, span, in, 1955, two, ferries, sank, in, the, shiun, maru, disaster, during, a, storm, killing, 168, people, the, ensuing, shock, and, public, outrage, convinced, the, japanese, government, to, develop, plans, for, a, bridge, to, cross, the, strait, investigations, for, a, bridge, across, the, strait, were, first, conducted, by, the, kobe, municipal, government, in, 1957, followed, by, an, evaluation, by, the, national, ministry, of, construction, in, 1959, in, 1961, the, ministry, of, construction, and, japan, national, railways, jointly, commissioned, the, japan, society, of, civil, engineers, jsce, to, conduct, a, technical, study, and, the, jsce, established, a, committee, to, investigate, five, potential, routes, between, honshu, and, shikoku, in, 1967, the, committee, compiled, the, results, of, the, technical, study, concluding, that, a, bridge, across, the, akashi, strait, would, face, extremely, severe, design, and, construction, conditions, which, have, no, similar, examples, in, the, world, s, long, span, bridges, and, recommending, additional, study, in, response, to, the, report, the, honshu, shikoku, bridge, authority, now, the, honshu, shikoku, bridge, expressway, company, was, established, in, 1970, which, conducted, extensive, investigations, including, sea, trials, to, establish, the, construction, method, of, a, submarine, foundation, in, 1973, a, bridge, with, a, central, span, of, 1, 780, meters, on, the, route, was, approved, but, construction, was, halted, due, to, poor, economic, conditions, the, original, plan, called, for, a, mixed, railway, road, bridge, but, when, construction, on, the, bridge, began, in, april, 1988, the, construction, was, restricted, to, road, only, with, six, lanes, actual, construction, did, not, begin, until, may, 1988, and, involved, more, than, 100, contractors, the, great, hanshin, earthquake, in, january, 1995, did, not, do, substantial, damage, to, the, bridge, due, to, anti, seismic, building, methods, construction, was, finished, on, time, in, september, 1996, the, bridge, was, opened, for, traffic, on, april, 5, 1998, in, a, ceremony, officiated, by, the, then, crown, prince, naruhito, and, his, spouse, crown, princess, masako, of, japan, along, with, construction, minister, tsutomu, kawara, the, bridge, has, four, substructures, two, main, piers, located, beneath, the, water, and, two, anchorages, on, land, these, are, denoted, 1a, 2p, 3p, and, 4a, in, sequence, from, the, kobe, side, 1a, consists, of, an, underground, circular, retaining, wall, filled, with, roller, compacted, concrete, 2p, and, 3p, are, circular, underwater, spread, foundation, caisson, structures, and, 4a, is, a, rectangular, direct, foundation, 2p, is, located, at, the, edge, of, the, sea, plateau, at, a, level, depth, of, 40, 50, m, and, a, bearing, depth, of, 60, m, and, 3p, is, located, at, the, symmetrical, point, to, 2p, with, respect, to, the, bridge, s, center, at, a, level, depth, of, 36, 39, m, and, a, bearing, depth, of, 57, m, the, towers, are, located, in, an, area, of, strong, tidal, currents, where, water, velocity, exceeds, 7, knots, about, 3, 6, m, s, the, selected, scour, protection, measure, includes, the, installation, of, a, filtering, layer, with, a, thickness, of, 2, m, in, a, range, of, 10, m, around, the, caisson, covered, with, rip, raps, of, 8, m, thick, the, bridge, has, three, spans, the, central, span, is, 1, 991, m, 6, 532, ft, and, the, two, other, sections, are, each, 960, m, 3, 150, ft, the, bridge, is, 3, 911, m, 12, 831, ft, long, overall, the, two, towers, were, originally, 1, 990, m, 6, 530, ft, apart, but, the, great, hanshin, earthquake, on, january, 17, 1995, magnitude, 7, 3, with, epicenter, 20, km, west, of, kobe, moved, the, towers, the, only, structures, that, had, been, erected, at, the, time, such, that, the, central, span, had, to, be, increased, by, 1, m, 3, 3, ft, the, central, span, was, required, to, be, greater, than, 1, 500, m, to, accommodate, maritime, traffic, it, was, concluded, before, construction, began, that, a, larger, span, between, 1950, and, 2050, meters, would, minimize, construction, costs, the, bridge, was, designed, with, a, dual, hinged, stiffening, girder, system, allowing, the, structure, to, withstand, winds, of, 286, kilometres, per, hour, 178, mph, earthquakes, measuring, up, to, magnitude, 8, 5, and, harsh, sea, currents, the, bridge, also, contains, tuned, mass, dampers, that, are, designed, to, operate, at, the, resonance, frequency, of, the, bridge, to, damp, forces, the, two, main, supporting, towers, rise, 282, 8, m, 928, ft, above, sea, level, and, the, bridge, can, expand, because, of, heat, by, up, to, 2, m, 6, 6, ft, over, the, course, of, a, day, each, anchorage, required, 350, 000, tonnes, 340, 000, long, tons, 390, 000, short, tons, of, concrete, the, steel, cables, have, 300, 000, kilometres, 190, 000, mi, of, wire, each, cable, is, 112, centimetres, 44, in, in, diameter, and, contains, 36, 830, strands, of, wire, the, akashi, kaikyo, bridge, has, a, total, of, 1, 737, illumination, lights, 1, 084, for, the, main, cables, 116, for, the, main, towers, 405, for, the, girders, and, 132, for, the, anchorages, sets, of, three, high, intensity, discharge, lamps, in, the, colors, red, green, and, blue, are, mounted, on, the, main, cables, the, rgb, color, model, and, computer, technology, make, for, a, variety, of, combinations, twenty, eight, patterns, are, used, for, occasions, such, as, national, or, regional, holidays, memorial, days, or, festivities, the, total, cost, is, estimated, at, 500, billion, or, us, 3, 6, billion, per, 1998, exchange, rates, it, is, expected, to, be, repaid, by, charging, drivers, a, toll, to, cross, the, bridge, the, toll, is, 2, 300, yen, and, the, bridge, is, used, by, approximately, 23, 000, cars, per, day
