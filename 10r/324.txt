drainage, is, the, natural, or, artificial, removal, of, a, surface, s, water, and, sub, surface, water, from, an, area, with, excess, water, the, internal, drainage, of, most, agricultural, soils, can, prevent, severe, waterlogging, anaerobic, conditions, that, harm, root, growth, but, many, soils, need, artificial, drainage, to, improve, production, or, to, manage, water, supplies, the, indus, valley, civilization, had, sewerage, and, drainage, systems, all, houses, in, the, major, cities, of, harappa, and, mohenjo, daro, had, access, to, water, and, drainage, facilities, waste, water, was, directed, to, covered, gravity, sewers, which, lined, the, major, streets, the, invention, of, hollow, pipe, drainage, is, credited, to, sir, hugh, dalrymple, who, died, in, 1753, new, storm, water, drainage, systems, incorporate, geotextile, filters, that, retain, and, prevent, fine, grains, of, soil, from, passing, into, and, clogging, the, drain, geotextiles, are, synthetic, textile, fabrics, specially, manufactured, for, civil, and, environmental, engineering, applications, geotextiles, are, designed, to, retain, fine, soil, particles, while, allowing, water, to, pass, through, in, a, typical, drainage, system, they, would, be, laid, along, a, trench, which, would, then, be, filled, with, coarse, granular, material, gravel, sea, shells, stone, or, rock, the, geotextile, is, then, folded, over, the, top, of, the, stone, and, the, trench, is, then, covered, by, soil, groundwater, seeps, through, the, geotextile, and, flows, through, the, stone, to, an, outfell, in, high, groundwater, conditions, a, perforated, plastic, pvc, or, pe, pipe, is, laid, along, the, base, of, the, drain, to, increase, the, volume, of, water, transported, in, the, drain, alternatively, a, prefabricated, plastic, drainage, system, made, of, hdpe, often, incorporating, geotextile, coco, fiber, or, rag, filters, can, be, considered, the, use, of, these, materials, has, become, increasingly, more, common, due, to, their, ease, of, use, since, they, eliminate, the, need, for, transporting, and, laying, stone, drainage, aggregate, which, is, invariably, more, expensive, than, a, synthetic, drain, and, concrete, liners, over, the, past, 30, years, geotextile, pvc, filters, and, hdpe, filters, have, become, the, most, commonly, used, soil, filter, media, they, are, cheap, to, produce, and, easy, to, lay, with, factory, controlled, properties, that, ensure, long, term, filtration, performance, even, in, fine, silty, soil, conditions, seattle, s, public, utilities, created, a, pilot, program, called, street, edge, alternatives, project, the, project, focuses, on, designing, a, system, to, provide, drainage, that, more, closely, mimics, the, natural, landscape, prior, to, development, than, traditional, piped, systems, the, streets, are, characterized, by, ditches, along, the, side, of, the, roadway, with, plantings, designed, throughout, the, area, an, emphasis, on, non, curbed, sidewalks, allows, water, to, flow, more, freely, into, the, areas, of, permeable, surface, on, the, side, of, the, streets, because, of, the, plantings, the, run, off, water, from, the, urban, area, does, not, all, directly, go, into, the, ground, but, can, also, be, absorbed, into, the, surrounding, environment, monitoring, conducted, by, seattle, public, utilities, reports, a, 99, percent, reduction, of, storm, water, leaving, the, drainage, project, drainage, has, undergone, a, large, scale, environmental, review, in, the, recent, past, in, the, united, kingdom, sustainable, urban, drainage, systems, suds, are, designed, to, encourage, contractors, to, install, drainage, system, that, more, closely, mimic, the, natural, flow, of, water, in, nature, since, 2010, local, and, neighbourhood, planning, in, the, uk, is, required, by, law, to, factor, suds, into, any, development, projects, that, they, are, responsible, for, slot, drainage, is, a, channel, drainage, system, designed, to, eliminate, the, need, for, further, pipework, systems, to, be, installed, in, parallel, to, the, drainage, reducing, the, environmental, impact, of, production, as, well, as, improving, water, collection, stainless, steel, concrete, channel, pvc, and, hdpe, are, all, materials, available, for, slot, drainage, which, have, become, industry, standards, on, construction, projects, the, civil, engineer, is, responsible, for, drainage, in, construction, projects, during, the, construction, process, they, set, out, all, the, necessary, levels, for, roads, street, gutters, drainage, culverts, and, sewers, involved, in, construction, operations, civil, engineers, and, construction, managers, work, alongside, architects, and, supervisors, planners, quantity, surveyors, and, the, general, workforce, as, well, as, subcontractors, typically, most, jurisdictions, have, some, body, of, drainage, law, to, govern, to, what, degree, a, landowner, can, alter, the, drainage, from, their, parcel, drainage, options, for, the, construction, industry, include, the, surface, opening, of, channel, drainage, usually, comes, in, the, form, of, gratings, polymer, plastic, steel, or, iron, or, a, single, slot, slot, drain, that, run, along, the, ground, surface, typically, manufactured, from, steel, or, iron, earth, retaining, structures, such, as, retaining, walls, also, need, to, have, groundwater, drainage, considered, during, their, construction, typical, retaining, walls, are, constructed, of, impermeable, material, which, can, block, the, path, of, groundwater, when, groundwater, flow, is, obstructed, hydrostatic, water, pressure, buildups, against, the, wall, and, may, cause, significant, damage, if, the, water, pressure, is, not, drained, appropriately, retaining, walls, can, bow, move, and, fracture, causing, seams, to, separate, the, water, pressure, can, also, erode, soil, particles, leading, to, voids, behind, the, wall, and, sinkholes, in, the, above, soil, traditional, retaining, wall, drainage, systems, can, include, french, drains, drain, pipes, or, weep, holes, to, prevent, soil, erosion, geotextile, filter, fabrics, are, installed, with, the, drainage, system, drainage, in, planters, refers, to, the, implementation, of, effective, drainage, systems, specifically, designed, for, plant, containers, or, pots, proper, drainage, is, crucial, in, planters, to, prevent, waterlogging, and, promote, healthy, plant, growth, planter, drainage, involves, the, incorporation, of, drainage, holes, drainage, layers, or, specialized, drainage, systems, to, ensure, excess, water, can, escape, from, the, planter, this, helps, to, prevent, root, rot, water, accumulation, and, other, issues, that, can, negatively, impact, plant, health, by, providing, adequate, drainage, in, planters, it, supports, optimal, plant, growth, and, contributes, to, the, overall, success, of, gardening, or, landscaping, projects, drainage, options, for, the, planter, include, wetland, soils, may, need, drainage, to, be, used, for, agriculture, in, the, northern, united, states, and, europe, glaciation, created, numerous, small, lakes, which, gradually, filled, with, humus, to, make, marshes, some, of, these, were, drained, using, open, ditches, and, trenches, to, make, mucklands, which, are, primarily, used, for, high, value, crops, such, as, vegetables, the, largest, project, of, this, type, in, the, world, has, been, in, process, for, centuries, in, the, netherlands, the, area, between, amsterdam, haarlem, and, leiden, was, in, prehistoric, times, swampland, and, small, lakes, turf, cutting, peat, mining, subsidence, and, shoreline, erosion, gradually, caused, the, formation, of, one, large, lake, the, haarlemmermeer, or, lake, of, haarlem, the, invention, of, wind, powered, pumping, engines, in, the, 15th, century, permitted, drainage, of, some, of, the, marginal, land, but, the, final, drainage, of, the, lake, had, to, await, the, design, of, large, steam, powered, pumps, and, agreements, between, regional, authorities, the, elimination, of, the, lake, occurred, between, 1849, and, 1852, creating, thousands, of, km, 2, of, new, land, coastal, plains, and, river, deltas, may, have, seasonally, or, permanently, high, water, tables, and, must, have, drainage, improvements, if, they, are, to, be, used, for, agriculture, an, example, is, the, flatwoods, citrus, growing, region, of, florida, united, states, after, periods, of, high, rainfall, drainage, pumps, are, employed, to, prevent, damage, to, the, citrus, groves, from, overly, wet, soils, rice, production, requires, complete, control, of, water, as, fields, need, to, be, flooded, or, drained, at, different, stages, of, the, crop, cycle, the, netherlands, has, also, led, the, way, in, this, type, of, drainage, not, only, to, drain, lowland, along, the, shore, but, actually, pushing, back, the, sea, until, the, original, nation, has, been, greatly, enlarged, in, moist, climates, soils, may, be, adequate, for, cropping, with, the, exception, that, they, become, waterlogged, for, brief, periods, each, year, from, snow, melt, or, from, heavy, rains, soils, that, are, predominantly, clay, will, pass, water, very, slowly, downward, meanwhile, plant, roots, suffocate, because, the, excessive, water, around, the, roots, eliminates, air, movement, through, the, soil, other, soils, may, have, an, impervious, layer, of, mineralized, soil, called, a, hardpan, or, relatively, impervious, rock, layers, may, underlie, shallow, soils, drainage, is, especially, important, in, tree, fruit, production, soils, that, are, otherwise, excellent, may, be, waterlogged, for, a, week, of, the, year, which, is, sufficient, to, kill, fruit, trees, and, cost, the, productivity, of, the, land, until, replacements, can, be, established, in, each, of, these, cases, appropriate, drainage, carries, off, temporary, flushes, of, water, to, prevent, damage, to, annual, or, perennial, crops, drier, areas, are, often, farmed, by, irrigation, and, one, would, not, consider, drainage, necessary, however, irrigation, water, always, contains, minerals, and, salts, which, can, be, concentrated, to, toxic, levels, by, evapotranspiration, irrigated, land, may, need, periodic, flushes, with, excessive, irrigation, water, and, drainage, to, control, soil, salinity
