urban, agriculture, refers, to, various, practices, of, cultivating, processing, and, distributing, food, in, urban, areas, the, term, also, applies, to, the, area, activities, of, animal, husbandry, aquaculture, beekeeping, and, horticulture, in, an, urban, context, urban, agriculture, is, distinguished, from, peri, urban, agriculture, which, takes, place, in, rural, areas, at, the, edge, of, suburbs, urban, agriculture, can, appear, at, varying, levels, of, economic, and, social, development, it, can, involve, a, movement, of, organic, growers, foodies, and, locavores, who, seek, to, form, social, networks, founded, on, a, shared, ethos, of, nature, and, community, holism, these, networks, can, develop, by, way, of, formal, institutional, support, becoming, integrated, into, local, town, planning, as, a, transition, town, movement, for, sustainable, urban, development, for, others, food, security, nutrition, and, income, generation, are, key, motivations, for, the, practice, in, either, case, the, more, direct, access, to, fresh, vegetable, fruit, and, meat, products, that, may, be, realised, through, urban, agriculture, can, improve, food, security, and, food, safety, while, decreasing, food, miles, leading, to, lower, greenhouse, gas, emissions, thereby, contributing, to, climate, change, mitigation, some, of, the, first, evidence, of, urban, agriculture, comes, from, mesopotamia, farmers, would, set, aside, small, plots, of, land, for, farming, within, the, city, s, walls, 3500bc, in, persia, s, semi, desert, towns, oases, were, fed, through, aqueducts, carrying, mountain, water, to, support, intensive, food, production, nurtured, by, wastes, from, the, communities, in, machu, picchu, water, was, conserved, and, reused, as, part, of, the, stepped, architecture, of, the, city, and, vegetable, beds, were, designed, to, gather, sun, in, order, to, prolong, the, growing, season, the, idea, of, supplemental, food, production, beyond, rural, farming, operations, and, distant, imports, is, not, new, it, was, used, during, war, and, depression, times, when, food, shortage, issues, arose, as, well, as, during, times, of, relative, abundance, allotment, gardens, emerged, in, germany, in, the, early, 19th, century, as, a, response, to, poverty, and, food, insecurity, in, the, context, of, the, usa, urban, agriculture, as, a, widely, recognized, practice, took, root, in, response, of, the, 1893, 1897, economic, depression, in, detroit, in, 1894, mayor, hazen, s, pingree, called, on, outlying, citizens, of, a, depression, struck, detroit, to, lend, their, properties, to, the, city, government, ahead, of, the, winter, season, the, detroit, government, would, in, turn, develop, these, lots, as, makeshift, potato, gardens, nicknamed, pingree, s, potato, patches, after, the, mayor, as, potatoes, were, weather, resistant, and, easy, to, grow, he, intended, for, these, gardens, to, produce, income, food, supply, and, boost, independence, during, times, of, hardship, the, detroit, project, was, successful, enough, that, other, us, cities, adopted, similar, urban, agriculture, practices, by, 1906, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, estimated, that, over, 75, 000, schools, alone, managed, urban, agriculture, programs, to, provide, children, and, their, families, with, fresh, produce, however, it, would, not, be, until, the, first, world, war, that, us, urban, agriculture, spread, widely, during, world, war, one, food, production, became, a, major, national, security, concern, for, several, countries, including, the, us, president, woodrow, wilson, called, upon, all, american, citizens, to, utilize, any, available, open, food, growth, seeing, this, as, a, way, to, pull, them, out, of, a, potentially, damaging, situation, of, food, insecurity, the, national, war, garden, committee, under, the, american, forestry, association, organized, campaigns, with, patriotic, messages, such, as, sow, the, seeds, of, victory, with, the, aim, of, reducing, domestic, pressure, on, food, production, in, so, doing, primary, agricultural, industries, could, focus, on, shipping, rations, to, troops, in, europe, so, called, victory, gardens, sprouted, during, world, war, one, emulated, later, during, world, war, two, in, the, us, as, well, as, canada, the, united, kingdom, by, 1919, american, victory, gardens, numbered, 5, million, plots, country, wide, and, over, 500, million, pounds, of, produce, was, harvested, so, efficient, were, the, american, urban, agriculture, programs, that, surplus, foodstuffs, were, shipped, to, war, ravaged, european, nations, in, addition, to, american, military, forces, a, very, similar, practice, came, into, use, during, the, great, depression, that, provided, a, purpose, job, and, food, to, those, who, would, otherwise, be, without, anything, during, such, harsh, times, these, efforts, helped, raise, spirits, and, boost, economic, growth, over, 2, 8, million, dollars, worth, of, food, was, produced, from, the, subsistence, gardens, during, the, depression, public, and, government, support, for, victory, gardens, waned, during, the, interwar, period, with, most, american, sites, becoming, repurposed, for, various, economic, development, initiatives, by, world, war, ii, the, war, food, administration, set, up, a, national, victory, garden, program, that, set, out, to, systematically, establish, functioning, agriculture, within, cities, indeed, these, new, victory, gardens, became, the, first, line, of, defense, for, the, country, once, more, the, government, supported, and, encouraged, victory, gardens, as, a, means, of, national, security, domestic, pressure, on, major, agricultural, industries, would, be, relieved, to, further, augment, the, war, economy, with, this, new, plan, in, action, as, many, as, 5, 5, million, americans, took, part, in, the, victory, garden, movement, and, over, nine, million, pounds, of, fruit, and, vegetables, were, grown, a, year, accounting, for, 44, of, us, grown, produce, throughout, that, time, in, the, post, war, period, the, us, government, gradually, stopped, assisting, urban, agriculture, programs, partially, due, to, the, lack, of, need, of, war, supplies, and, partially, due, to, the, us, fully, embracing, industrialized, food, systems, by, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, urban, agriculture, was, more, focused, on, grassroots, initiatives, spearheaded, by, politicized, social, movements, including, the, african, american, civil, rights, these, groups, benefited, from, a, great, number, of, vacant, lots, left, behind, during, a, period, of, post, war, urban, to, suburban, migration, despite, these, efforts, vacant, lots, as, a, whole, became, seen, as, blighted, decaying, areas, some, american, cities, such, as, syracuse, ny, once, more, supported, urban, agriculture, programs, not, for, food, security, but, to, make, these, vacant, lots, more, appealing, social, and, environmental, justice, groups, such, as, new, york, city, based, green, guerillas, seattle, based, p, patch, boston, based, urban, gardeners, and, philadelphia, based, philadelphia, green, continued, to, shape, american, urban, agricultural, practices, during, the, 1970s, these, groups, and, many, others, reinvigorated, interest, in, urban, agriculture, aimed, not, only, at, community, development, but, also, combating, environmental, crises, american, urban, agriculture, initiatives, during, the, 1980s, built, upon, the, previous, decade, s, focus, on, community, engagement, a, natural, evolution, was, sites, of, urban, agriculture, entering, everyday, community, roles, and, consequently, requiring, more, funding, than, grassroots, movements, could, muster, the, us, government, created, an, urban, garden, program, which, funded, programs, in, twenty, eight, cities, who, in, turn, produced, roughly, twenty, one, million, dollars, of, produce, though, some, sites, of, urban, agriculture, were, repurposed, for, other, economic, development, the, overall, trend, of, the, 1980s, was, an, expansion, of, the, practice, the, 1990s, continued, this, growth, of, urban, agriculture, sites, in, the, us, while, also, expanding, their, purposes, a, result, of, this, broadening, was, the, division, of, urban, agriculture, practitioners, based, on, motivations, organizational, structure, and, a, host, of, other, operational, concerns, throughout, the, 2000s, 2010s, and, 2020s, urban, agriculture, sites, and, usages, of, these, sites, have, continued, to, grow, groups, managing, some, sites, focus, on, the, economic, security, and, cultural, preservation, of, immigrants, such, as, the, hmong, american, communities, in, various, us, states, other, groups, incorporate, urban, agriculture, programs, as, part, of, wider, social, justice, missions, such, as, those, in, the, city, of, wilmington, delaware, still, others, seek, to, use, urban, agriculture, as, a, means, of, combating, community, scale, food, insecurity, as, part, of, wider, goals, of, rewilding, cities, and, human, diets, among, a, multitude, of, other, uses, much, attention, has, been, placed, on, the, practice, of, urban, agriculture, in, connection, to, food, movements, such, as, alternative, food, networks, sustainable, food, networks, and, local, food, movements, alternative, food, networks, seek, to, redefine, food, production, distribution, and, consumption, by, considering, the, sociocultural, elements, of, local, communities, and, economies, sustainable, food, networks, are, a, related, concept, but, focus, more, on, ecological, concerns, local, food, networks, focus, more, on, the, political, responses, to, globalization, or, concerns, with, the, environmental, impacts, of, industrialized, food, transportation, there, is, no, overarching, term, for, agricultural, plots, in, urban, areas, gardens, and, farms, while, not, easy, to, define, are, the, two, main, types, according, to, the, usda, a, farm, is, any, place, from, which, 1, 000, or, more, of, agricultural, products, were, produced, and, sold, in, europe, the, term, city, farm, is, used, to, include, gardens, and, farms, any, plot, with, produce, being, grown, in, it, can, be, considered, an, urban, farm, size, does, not, matter, it, is, more, about, growing, produce, on, your, own, in, your, personal, plot, or, garden, many, communities, make, community, gardening, accessible, to, the, public, providing, space, for, citizens, to, cultivate, plants, for, food, recreation, and, education, in, many, cities, small, plots, of, land, and, also, rooftops, are, used, for, community, members, to, garden, community, gardens, give, citizens, the, opportunity, to, learn, about, horticulture, through, trial, and, error, and, get, a, better, understanding, of, the, process, of, producing, food, and, other, plants, all, while, still, being, able, to, feed, those, people, in, need, from, the, community, it, holds, as, both, a, learning, experience, as, well, as, a, means, of, help, for, those, people, in, need, a, community, gardening, program, that, is, well, established, is, seattle, s, p, patch, the, grassroots, permaculture, movement, has, been, hugely, influential, in, the, renaissance, of, urban, agriculture, throughout, the, world, during, the, 1960s, a, number, of, community, gardens, were, established, in, the, united, kingdom, influenced, by, the, community, garden, movement, in, the, united, states, bristol, s, severn, project, was, established, in, 2010, for, 2500, and, provides, 34, tons, of, produce, per, year, employing, people, from, disadvantaged, backgrounds, the, first, urban, agriculture, method, of, growing, occurs, when, family, farms, maintain, their, land, as, the, city, grows, around, it, city, farms, urban, farms, are, agricultural, plots, in, urban, areas, that, have, people, working, with, animals, and, plants, to, produce, food, they, are, usually, community, run, gardens, seeking, to, improve, community, relationships, and, offer, an, awareness, of, agriculture, and, farming, to, people, who, live, in, urbanized, areas, although, the, name, says, urban, urban, farming, does, not, have, to, be, in, the, urban, area, it, can, be, in, the, backyard, of, a, house, or, the, rooftop, of, an, apartment, building, they, are, important, sources, of, food, security, for, many, communities, around, the, globe, city, farms, vary, in, size, from, small, plots, in, private, yards, to, larger, farms, that, occupy, a, number, of, acres, in, 1996, a, united, nations, report, estimated, there, are, over, 800, million, people, worldwide, who, grow, food, and, raise, livestock, in, cities, although, some, city, farms, have, paid, employees, most, rely, heavily, on, volunteer, labour, and, some, are, run, by, volunteers, alone, other, city, farms, operate, as, partnerships, with, local, authorities, an, early, city, farm, was, set, up, in, 1972, in, kentish, town, london, it, combines, farm, animals, with, gardening, space, an, addition, inspired, by, children, s, farms, in, the, netherlands, other, city, farms, followed, across, london, and, the, united, kingdom, in, australia, several, city, farms, exist, in, various, capital, cities, in, melbourne, the, collingwood, children, s, farm, was, established, in, 1979, on, the, abbotsford, precinct, heritage, farmlands, the, aphf, the, oldest, continually, farmed, land, in, victoria, farmed, since, 1838, in, 2010, new, york, city, saw, the, building, and, opening, of, the, world, s, largest, privately, owned, and, operated, rooftop, farm, followed, by, an, even, larger, location, in, 2012, both, were, a, result, of, municipal, programs, such, as, the, green, roof, tax, abatement, program, and, green, infrastructure, grant, program, in, singapore, hydroponic, rooftop, farms, which, also, rely, on, vertical, farming, are, appearing, the, goal, behind, these, is, to, rejuvenate, areas, and, workforces, that, have, thus, far, been, marginalized, simultaneously, top, level, pesticide, free, produce, will, be, grown, and, harvested, aquaponics, is, a, closed, loop, farming, technique, that, ingeniously, combines, aquaculture, and, hydroponics, to, create, a, self, sustaining, ecosystem, in, this, mutually, beneficial, relationship, fish, waste, serves, as, a, natural, fertilizer, for, the, plants, while, the, plants, filter, and, purify, the, water, for, the, fish, this, ingenious, system, not, only, minimizes, water, usage, but, also, eliminates, the, need, for, chemical, fertilizers, making, it, an, eco, friendly, and, resource, efficient, method, of, food, production, the, origins, of, aquaponics, can, be, traced, back, to, the, ancient, aztecs, in, mexico, who, practiced, a, form, of, this, method, by, cultivating, crops, on, floating, rafts, in, nutrient, rich, waters, in, modern, times, researchers, like, dr, mark, mcmurtry, and, dr, james, rakocy, further, developed, and, popularized, aquaponics, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, in, practice, fish, are, raised, in, a, tank, and, their, waste, releases, ammonia, beneficial, bacteria, then, convert, the, ammonia, into, nitrites, and, nitrates, which, serve, as, essential, nutrients, for, the, plants, as, the, plants, take, up, these, nutrients, they, cleanse, the, water, which, is, recirculated, back, to, the, fish, tank, completing, the, sustainable, loop, vertical, farming, has, emerged, as, a, solution, for, sustainable, urban, agriculture, enabling, crops, to, be, cultivated, in, vertically, stacked, layers, or, inclined, surfaces, within, controlled, indoor, environments, this, approach, maximizes, space, utilization, and, facilitates, year, round, cultivation, making, it, an, ideal, choice, for, densely, populated, urban, areas, with, limited, land, availability, the, concept, of, vertical, farming, dates, back, to, the, early, 20th, century, but, its, recent, popularity, has, surged, due, to, the, challenges, posed, by, urbanization, and, the, growing, demand, for, sustainable, food, production, vertical, farms, have, gained, significant, traction, globally, as, they, offer, solutions, to, overcome, the, limitations, associated, with, traditional, agriculture, in, practice, vertical, farms, employ, advanced, techniques, such, as, hydroponics, or, aeroponics, allowing, plants, to, grow, without, soil, by, using, nutrient, rich, water, or, air, instead, by, utilizing, vertical, space, these, farms, achieve, higher, crop, yields, per, square, foot, compared, to, conventional, farming, methods, the, integration, of, artificial, lighting, and, sophisticated, climate, control, systems, ensures, optimal, conditions, for, crop, growth, throughout, the, year, singapore, stands, at, the, forefront, of, the, vertical, farming, movement, embracing, this, technology, driven, agriculture, to, address, its, limited, land, availability, and, secure, food, sustainability, as, a, densely, populated, city, state, singapore, s, adoption, of, vertical, farming, showcases, how, innovative, approaches, to, agriculture, can, effectively, tackle, the, challenges, of, urban, living, while, promoting, sustainable, food, production, the, obstacles, that, vertical, farming, must, overcome, include, training, indoor, farming, expertise, commercial, feasibility, and, resistance, from, city, people, politicians, indoor, farming, is, a, method, involves, cultivating, plants, indoors, free, from, the, constraints, of, traditional, agriculture, such, as, weather, fluctuations, and, limited, land, availability, the, concept, of, indoor, farming, emerged, as, a, solution, to, the, challenges, faced, by, conventional, farming, methods, with, unpredictable, weather, patterns, and, urbanization, taking, up, valuable, arable, land, indoor, farming, offers, a, sustainable, alternative, in, practice, indoor, farms, utilize, advanced, techniques, like, hydroponics, aeroponics, or, aquaponics, to, cultivate, plants, these, systems, provide, a, soil, less, environment, ensuring, efficient, use, of, resources, and, optimal, plant, growth, climate, control, systems, play, a, crucial, role, in, maintaining, the, perfect, conditions, for, crops, regulating, temperature, humidity, and, lighting, artificial, lighting, often, powered, by, energy, efficient, led, technology, ensures, that, plants, receive, the, right, light, spectrum, for, photosynthesis, resulting, in, healthy, and, abundant, harvests, the, ultimate, goal, of, developments, includes, providing, superior, agricultural, products, that, meet, urban, consumers, safety, requirements, the, urban, agriculture, network, has, defined, urban, agriculture, as, an, industry, that, produces, processes, and, markets, food, fuel, and, other, outputs, largely, in, response, to, the, daily, demand, of, consumers, within, a, town, city, or, metropolis, many, types, of, privately, and, publicly, held, land, and, water, bodies, were, found, throughout, intra, urban, and, peri, urban, areas, typically, urban, agriculture, applies, intensive, production, methods, frequently, using, and, reusing, natural, resources, and, urban, wastes, to, yield, a, diverse, array, of, land, water, and, air, based, fauna, and, flora, contributing, to, food, security, health, livelihood, and, environment, of, the, individual, household, and, community, with, rising, urbanization, food, resources, in, urban, areas, are, less, accessible, than, in, rural, areas, this, disproportionately, affects, the, poorest, communities, and, the, lack, of, food, access, and, increased, risk, of, malnutrition, has, been, linked, to, socioeconomic, inequities, economic, barriers, to, food, access, are, linked, to, capitalist, market, structures, and, lead, to, socioeconomic, inequities, in, food, choices, less, healthful, foods, and, phenomena, such, as, food, deserts, additionally, racialized, systems, of, governance, of, urban, poor, communities, facilitates, the, increasing, prominence, of, issues, such, as, unemployment, poverty, access, to, health, educational, and, social, resources, including, a, community, s, access, to, healthy, food, today, some, cities, have, much, vacant, land, due, to, urban, sprawl, and, home, foreclosures, this, land, could, be, used, to, address, food, insecurity, one, study, of, cleveland, shows, that, the, city, could, actually, meet, up, to, 100, of, its, fresh, produce, need, this, would, prevent, up, to, 115, million, in, annual, economic, leakage, using, the, rooftop, space, of, new, york, city, would, also, be, able, to, provide, roughly, twice, the, amount, of, space, necessary, to, supply, new, york, city, with, its, green, vegetable, yields, space, could, be, even, better, optimized, through, the, usage, of, hydroponic, or, indoor, factory, production, of, food, growing, gardens, within, cities, would, also, cut, down, on, the, amount, of, food, waste, in, order, to, fund, these, projects, it, would, require, financial, capital, in, the, form, of, private, enterprises, or, government, funding, the, council, for, agricultural, science, and, technology, cast, defines, urban, agriculture, to, include, aspects, of, environmental, health, remediation, and, recreation, urban, agriculture, is, a, complex, system, encompassing, a, spectrum, of, interests, from, a, traditional, core, of, activities, associated, with, the, production, processing, marketing, distribution, and, consumption, to, a, multiplicity, of, other, benefits, and, services, that, are, less, widely, acknowledged, and, documented, these, include, recreation, and, leisure, economic, vitality, and, business, entrepreneurship, individual, health, and, well, being, community, health, and, well, being, landscape, beautification, and, environmental, restoration, and, remediation, modern, planning, and, design, initiatives, are, often, more, responsive, to, this, model, of, urban, agriculture, because, it, fits, within, the, current, scope, of, sustainable, design, the, definition, allows, for, a, multitude, of, interpretations, across, cultures, and, time, frequently, it, is, tied, to, policy, decisions, to, build, sustainable, cities, urban, farms, also, provide, unique, opportunities, for, individuals, especially, those, living, in, cities, to, get, actively, involved, with, ecological, citizenship, by, reconnecting, with, food, production, and, nature, urban, community, gardening, teaches, individuals, the, skills, necessary, to, participate, in, a, democratic, society, decisions, must, be, made, on, a, group, level, basis, in, order, to, run, the, farm, most, effective, results, are, achieved, when, residents, of, a, community, are, asked, to, take, on, more, active, roles, in, the, farm, urban, farming, is, subject, to, less, stringent, regulation, compared, to, commercial, agriculture, this, lack, of, oversight, allows, for, the, use, of, chemicals, without, the, same, level, of, monitoring, or, disclosure, required, of, commercial, growers, as, a, result, there, is, limited, transparency, regarding, the, substances, that, may, be, applied, in, urban, farming, practices, access, to, nutritious, food, both, economically, and, geographically, is, another, perspective, in, the, effort, to, locate, food, and, livestock, production, in, cities, the, tremendous, influx, of, the, world, population, to, urban, areas, has, increased, the, need, for, fresh, and, safe, food, the, community, food, security, coalition, cfsc, defines, food, security, as, all, persons, in, a, community, having, access, to, culturally, acceptable, nutritionally, adequate, food, through, local, non, emergency, sources, at, all, times, areas, faced, with, food, security, issues, have, limited, choices, often, relying, on, highly, processed, fast, food, or, convenience, store, foods, that, are, high, in, calories, and, low, in, nutrients, which, may, lead, to, elevated, rates, of, diet, related, illnesses, such, as, diabetes, these, problems, have, brought, about, the, concept, of, food, justice, which, alkon, and, norgaard, 2009, 289, explain, that, places, access, to, healthy, affordable, culturally, appropriate, food, in, the, contexts, of, institutional, racism, racial, formation, and, racialized, geographies, food, justice, serves, as, a, theoretical, and, political, bridge, between, scholarship, and, activism, on, sustainable, agriculture, food, insecurity, and, environmental, justice, some, systematic, reviews, have, already, explored, urban, agriculture, contribution, to, food, security, and, other, determinants, of, health, outcomes, see, urban, agriculture, is, part, of, a, larger, discussion, of, the, need, for, alternative, agricultural, paradigms, to, address, food, insecurity, inaccessibility, of, fresh, foods, and, unjust, practices, on, multiple, levels, of, the, food, system, and, this, discussion, has, been, led, by, different, actors, including, food, insecure, individuals, farm, workers, educators, and, academics, policymakers, social, movements, organizations, and, marginalized, people, globally, the, issue, of, food, security, is, accompanied, by, the, related, movements, of, food, justice, and, food, sovereignty, these, movements, incorporate, urban, agriculture, in, how, they, address, food, resources, of, a, community, food, sovereignty, in, addition, to, promoting, food, access, also, seeks, to, address, the, power, dynamics, and, political, economy, of, food, it, accounts, for, the, embedded, power, structures, of, the, food, system, ownership, of, production, and, decision, making, on, multiple, levels, i, e, growing, processing, and, distribution, under, this, framework, representative, decision, making, and, responsiveness, to, the, community, are, core, features, agroecology, is, a, scientific, framework, movement, and, applied, practice, of, agricultural, management, systems, that, seeks, to, achieve, food, sovereignty, within, food, systems, in, contrast, to, the, dominant, model, of, agriculture, agroecology, emphasizes, the, importance, of, soil, health, by, fostering, connections, between, the, diverse, biotic, and, abiotic, factors, present, it, prioritizes, farmer, and, consumer, well, being, traditional, knowledge, revival, and, democratized, learning, systems, transdisciplinarity, and, diversity, of, knowledge, is, a, central, theme, to, agroecology, so, many, urban, agroecology, initiatives, address, topics, of, social, justice, gender, empowerment, ecological, sustainability, indigenous, sovereignty, and, public, participation, in, addition, to, promoting, food, access, for, example, agroecology, has, been, integral, to, social, movements, surrounding, public, demand, for, sustainably, grown, food, free, from, pesticides, and, other, chemicals, under, an, agroecological, framework, urban, agriculture, alleviates, much, more, than, simply, food, insecurity, by, also, encouraging, discourse, about, all, facets, of, community, wellness, from, physical, and, mental, health, to, community, connectedness, it, has, the, potential, to, play, a, role, as, a, public, space, as, an, economic, development, strategy, and, as, a, community, organizing, tool, while, alleviating, food, insecurity, in, general, urban, and, peri, urban, agriculture, upa, contributes, to, food, availability, particularly, of, fresh, produce, provides, employment, and, income, and, can, contribute, to, the, food, security, and, nutrition, of, urban, dwellers, urban, and, peri, urban, agriculture, upa, expands, the, economic, base, of, the, city, through, production, processing, packaging, and, marketing, of, consumable, products, this, results, in, an, increase, in, entrepreneurial, activities, and, the, creation, of, jobs, as, well, as, reducing, food, costs, and, improving, quality, upa, provides, employment, income, and, access, to, food, for, urban, populations, which, helps, to, relieve, chronic, and, emergency, food, insecurity, chronic, food, insecurity, refers, to, less, affordable, food, and, growing, urban, poverty, while, emergency, food, insecurity, relates, to, breakdowns, in, the, chain, of, food, distribution, upa, plays, an, important, role, in, making, food, more, affordable, and, in, providing, emergency, supplies, of, food, research, into, market, values, for, produce, grown, in, urban, gardens, has, been, attributed, to, a, community, garden, plot, a, median, yield, value, of, between, approximately, 200, and, 500, us, adjusted, for, inflation, urban, agriculture, can, have, a, large, impact, on, the, social, and, emotional, well, being, of, individuals, ua, can, have, an, overall, positive, impact, on, community, health, which, directly, impacts, individuals, social, and, emotional, well, being, urban, gardens, are, often, places, that, facilitate, positive, social, interaction, which, also, contributes, to, overall, social, and, emotional, well, being, urban, agriculture, sites, have, been, noted, as, lowering, crime, rates, generally, in, local, neighborhoods, many, gardens, facilitate, the, improvement, of, social, networks, within, the, communities, that, they, are, located, for, many, neighborhoods, gardens, provide, a, symbolic, focus, which, leads, to, increased, neighborhood, pride, urban, agriculture, increases, community, participation, through, diagnostic, workshops, or, different, commissions, in, the, area, of, vegetable, gardens, activities, which, involve, hundreds, of, people, when, individuals, come, together, around, ua, physical, activity, levels, are, often, increased, this, can, also, raise, serotonin, levels, akin, to, working, out, at, a, gym, there, is, the, added, element, of, walking, biking, to, the, gardens, further, increasing, physical, activity, and, the, benefits, of, being, outdoors, upa, can, be, seen, as, a, means, of, improving, the, livelihood, of, people, living, in, and, around, cities, taking, part, in, such, practices, is, seen, mostly, as, an, informal, activity, but, in, many, cities, where, inadequate, unreliable, and, irregular, access, to, food, is, a, recurring, problem, urban, agriculture, has, been, a, positive, response, to, tackling, food, concerns, due, to, the, food, security, that, comes, with, ua, feelings, of, independence, and, empowerment, often, arise, the, ability, to, produce, and, grow, food, for, oneself, has, also, been, reported, to, improve, levels, of, self, esteem, or, of, self, efficacy, households, and, small, communities, take, advantage, of, vacant, land, and, contribute, not, only, to, their, household, food, needs, but, also, the, needs, of, their, resident, city, the, cfsc, states, that, community, and, residential, gardening, as, well, as, small, scale, farming, save, household, food, dollars, they, promote, nutrition, and, free, cash, for, non, garden, foods, and, other, items, as, an, example, you, can, raise, your, own, chickens, on, an, urban, farm, and, have, fresh, eggs, for, only, 0, 44, per, dozen, this, allows, families, to, generate, larger, incomes, selling, to, local, grocers, or, to, local, outdoor, markets, while, supplying, their, household, with, the, proper, nutrition, of, fresh, and, nutritional, products, with, the, popularity, of, farmers, markets, recently, this, has, allowed, an, even, larger, income, some, community, urban, farms, can, be, quite, efficient, and, help, women, find, work, who, in, some, cases, are, marginalized, from, finding, employment, in, the, formal, economy, studies, have, shown, that, participation, from, women, have, a, higher, production, rate, therefore, producing, the, adequate, amount, for, household, consumption, while, supplying, more, for, market, sale, as, most, ua, activities, are, conducted, on, vacant, municipal, land, there, have, been, raising, concerns, about, the, allocation, of, land, and, property, rights, the, idrc, and, the, fao, have, published, the, guidelines, for, municipal, policymaking, on, urban, agriculture, and, are, working, with, municipal, governments, to, create, successful, policy, measures, that, can, be, incorporated, in, urban, planning, over, a, third, of, us, households, roughly, 42, million, participate, in, food, gardening, there, has, also, been, an, increase, of, 63, participation, in, farming, by, millennials, from, 2008, to, 2013, us, households, participating, in, community, gardening, has, also, tripled, from, 1, to, 3, million, in, that, time, frame, urban, agriculture, provides, unique, opportunities, to, bridge, diverse, communities, together, in, addition, it, provides, opportunities, for, health, care, providers, to, interact, with, their, patients, thus, making, each, community, garden, a, hub, that, is, reflective, of, the, community, the, current, industrial, agriculture, system, is, accountable, for, high, energy, costs, for, the, transportation, of, foodstuffs, according, to, a, study, by, rich, pirog, associate, director, of, the, leopold, center, for, sustainable, agriculture, at, iowa, state, university, the, average, conventional, produce, item, travels, 1, 500, miles, 2, 400, km, using, if, shipped, by, tractor, trailer, 1, us, gallon, 3, 8, l, 0, 83, imp, gal, of, fossil, fuel, per, 100, pounds, 45, kg, the, energy, used, to, transport, food, is, decreased, when, urban, agriculture, can, provide, cities, with, locally, grown, food, pirog, found, that, traditional, non, local, food, distribution, system, used, 4, to, 17, times, more, fuel, and, emitted, 5, to, 17, times, more, co, 2, than, the, local, and, regional, transport, similarly, in, a, study, by, marc, xuereb, and, region, of, waterloo, public, health, it, was, estimated, that, switching, to, locally, grown, food, could, save, transport, related, emissions, equivalent, to, nearly, 50, 000, metric, tons, of, co, 2, or, the, equivalent, of, taking, 16, 191, cars, off, the, road, in, theory, one, would, save, money, but, everything, is, being, run, on, the, house, s, power, grid, most, of, the, time, so, prices, can, vary, according, to, when, you, water, or, how, you, water, etc, as, mentioned, above, the, energy, efficient, nature, of, urban, agriculture, can, reduce, each, city, s, carbon, footprint, by, reducing, the, amount, of, transport, that, occurs, to, deliver, goods, to, the, consumer, such, areas, can, act, as, carbon, sinks, offsetting, some, of, the, carbon, accumulation, that, is, innate, to, urban, areas, where, pavement, and, buildings, outnumber, plants, plants, absorb, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, and, release, breathable, oxygen, o, 2, through, photosynthesis, the, process, of, carbon, sequestration, can, be, further, improved, by, combining, other, agriculture, techniques, to, increase, removal, from, the, atmosphere, and, prevent, the, release, of, co, 2, during, harvest, time, however, this, process, relies, heavily, on, the, types, of, plants, selected, and, the, methodology, of, farming, specifically, choosing, plants, that, do, not, lose, their, leaves, and, remain, green, all, year, can, increase, the, farm, s, ability, to, sequester, carbon, the, reduction, in, ozone, and, other, particulate, matter, can, benefit, human, health, reducing, these, particulates, and, ozone, gases, could, reduce, mortality, rates, in, urban, areas, along, with, increase, the, health, of, those, living, in, cities, a, 2011, article, found, that, a, rooftop, containing, 2000, m, 2, of, uncut, grass, has, the, potential, to, remove, up, to, 4000, kg, of, particulate, matter, and, that, one, square, meter, of, green, roof, is, sufficient, to, offset, the, annual, particulate, matter, emissions, of, a, car, vacant, urban, lots, are, often, victims, to, illegal, dumping, of, hazardous, chemicals, and, other, wastes, they, are, also, liable, to, accumulate, standing, water, and, grey, water, which, can, be, dangerous, to, public, health, especially, left, stagnant, for, long, periods, the, implementation, of, urban, agriculture, in, these, vacant, lots, can, be, a, cost, effective, method, for, removing, these, chemicals, in, the, process, known, as, phytoremediation, plants, and, the, associated, microorganisms, are, selected, for, their, chemical, ability, to, degrade, absorb, convert, to, an, inert, form, and, remove, toxins, from, the, soil, several, chemicals, can, be, targeted, for, removal, including, heavy, metals, e, g, mercury, and, lead, inorganic, compounds, e, g, arsenic, and, uranium, and, organic, compounds, e, g, petroleum, and, chlorinated, compounds, like, pbcs, phytoremeditation, is, both, an, environmentally, friendly, cost, effective, and, energy, efficient, measure, to, reduce, pollution, phytoremediation, only, costs, about, 5, 40, per, ton, of, soil, being, decontaminated, implementation, of, this, process, also, reduces, the, amount, of, soil, that, must, be, disposed, of, in, a, hazardous, waste, landfill, urban, agriculture, as, a, method, to, mediate, chemical, pollution, can, be, effective, in, preventing, the, spread, of, these, chemicals, into, the, surrounding, environment, other, methods, of, remediation, often, disturb, the, soil, and, force, the, chemicals, contained, within, it, into, the, air, or, water, plants, can, be, used, as, a, method, to, remove, chemicals, and, also, to, hold, the, soil, and, prevent, erosion, of, contaminated, soil, decreasing, the, spread, of, pollutants, and, the, hazard, presented, by, these, lots, one, way, of, identifying, soil, contamination, is, through, using, already, well, established, plants, as, bioindicators, of, soil, health, using, well, studied, plants, is, important, because, there, has, already, been, substantial, bodies, of, work, to, test, them, in, various, conditions, so, responses, can, be, verified, with, certainty, such, plants, are, also, valuable, because, they, are, genetically, identical, as, crops, as, opposed, to, natural, variants, of, the, same, species, typically, urban, soil, has, had, the, topsoil, stripped, away, and, has, led, to, soil, with, low, aeration, porosity, and, drainage, typical, measures, of, soil, health, are, microbial, biomass, and, activity, enzymes, soil, organic, matter, som, total, nitrogen, available, nutrients, porosity, aggregate, stability, and, compaction, a, new, measurement, is, active, carbon, ac, which, is, the, most, usable, portion, of, the, total, organic, carbon, toc, in, the, soil, this, contributes, greatly, to, the, functionality, of, the, soil, food, web, using, common, crops, which, are, generally, well, studied, as, bioindicators, can, be, used, to, effectively, test, the, quality, of, an, urban, farming, plot, before, beginning, planting, large, amounts, of, noise, pollution, not, only, lead, to, lower, property, values, and, high, frustration, they, can, be, damaging, to, human, hearing, and, health, the, study, noise, exposure, and, public, health, found, that, exposure, to, continual, noise, is, a, public, health, problem, examples, of, the, detriment, of, continual, noise, on, humans, to, include, hearing, impairment, hypertension, and, ischemic, heart, disease, annoyance, sleep, disturbance, and, decreased, school, performance, since, most, roofs, or, vacant, lots, consist, of, hard, flat, surfaces, that, reflect, sound, waves, instead, of, absorbing, them, adding, plants, that, can, absorb, these, waves, has, the, potential, to, lead, to, a, vast, reduction, in, noise, pollution, daily, intake, of, a, variety, of, fruits, and, vegetables, is, linked, to, a, decreased, risk, of, chronic, diseases, including, diabetes, heart, disease, and, cancer, urban, agriculture, is, associated, with, increased, consumption, of, fruits, and, vegetables, which, decreases, risk, for, disease, and, can, be, a, cost, effective, way, to, provide, citizens, with, quality, fresh, produce, in, urban, settings, produce, from, urban, gardens, can, be, perceived, to, be, more, flavorful, and, desirable, than, store, bought, produce, which, may, also, lead, to, a, wider, acceptance, and, higher, intake, a, flint, michigan, study, found, that, those, participating, in, community, gardens, consumed, fruits, and, vegetables, 1, 4, times, more, per, day, and, were, 3, 5, times, more, likely, to, consume, fruits, or, vegetables, at, least, 5, times, daily, p, 1, garden, based, education, can, also, yield, nutritional, benefits, in, children, an, idaho, study, reported, a, positive, association, between, school, gardens, and, increased, intake, of, fruit, vegetables, vitamin, a, vitamin, c, and, fiber, among, sixth, graders, harvesting, fruits, and, vegetables, initiates, the, enzymatic, process, of, nutrient, degradation, which, is, especially, detrimental, to, water, soluble, vitamins, such, as, ascorbic, acid, and, thiamin, the, process, of, blanching, produce, in, order, to, freeze, or, can, reduce, nutrient, content, slightly, but, not, nearly, as, much, as, the, amount, of, time, spent, in, storage, harvesting, produce, from, one, s, own, community, garden, cuts, back, on, storage, times, significantly, urban, agriculture, also, provides, quality, nutrition, for, low, income, households, studies, show, that, every, 1, invested, in, a, community, garden, yields, 6, worth, of, vegetables, if, labor, is, not, considered, a, factor, in, investment, many, urban, gardens, reduce, the, strain, on, food, banks, and, other, emergency, food, providers, by, donating, shares, of, their, harvest, and, providing, fresh, produce, in, areas, that, otherwise, might, be, food, deserts, the, supplemental, nutrition, program, women, infants, and, children, wic, as, well, as, the, supplemental, nutrition, assistance, program, snap, have, partnered, with, several, urban, gardens, nationwide, to, improve, the, accessibility, to, produce, in, exchange, for, a, few, hours, of, volunteer, gardening, work, urban, farming, has, been, shown, to, increase, health, outcomes, gardeners, consume, twice, as, much, fruit, and, vegetables, than, non, gardeners, levels, of, physical, activity, are, also, positively, associated, with, urban, farming, these, results, are, seen, indirectly, and, can, be, supported, by, the, social, involvement, in, an, individual, s, community, as, a, member, of, the, community, farm, this, social, involvement, helped, raise, the, aesthetic, appeal, of, the, neighborhood, boosting, the, motivation, or, efficacy, of, the, community, as, a, whole, this, increased, efficacy, was, shown, to, increase, neighborhood, attachment, therefore, the, positive, health, outcomes, of, urban, farming, can, be, explained, in, part, by, interpersonal, and, social, factors, that, boost, health, focusing, on, improving, the, aesthetics, and, community, relationships, and, not, only, on, the, plant, yield, is, the, best, way, to, maximize, the, positive, effect, of, urban, farms, on, a, neighborhood, using, high, density, urban, farming, with, vertical, farms, or, stacked, greenhouses, many, environmental, benefits, can, be, achieved, on, a, citywide, scale, that, would, be, impossible, otherwise, these, systems, do, not, only, provide, food, but, also, produce, potable, water, from, waste, water, and, can, recycle, organic, waste, back, to, energy, and, nutrients, at, the, same, time, they, can, reduce, food, related, transportation, to, a, minimum, while, providing, fresh, food, for, large, communities, in, almost, any, climate, a, 2009, report, by, the, usda, determined, that, evidence, is, both, abundant, and, robust, enough, for, us, to, conclude, that, americans, living, in, low, income, and, minority, areas, tend, to, have, poor, access, to, healthy, food, and, that, the, structural, inequalities, in, these, neighborhoods, contribute, to, inequalities, in, diet, and, diet, related, outcomes, these, diet, related, outcomes, including, obesity, and, diabetes, have, become, epidemic, in, low, income, urban, environments, in, the, united, states, although, the, definition, and, methods, for, determining, food, deserts, have, varied, studies, indicate, that, at, least, in, the, united, states, there, are, racial, disparities, in, the, food, environment, thus, using, the, definition, of, environment, as, the, place, where, people, live, work, play, and, pray, food, disparities, become, an, issue, of, environmental, justice, this, is, especially, true, in, american, inner, cities, where, a, history, of, racist, practices, have, contributed, to, the, development, of, food, deserts, in, the, low, income, minority, areas, of, the, urban, core, the, issue, of, inequality, is, so, integral, to, the, issues, of, food, access, and, health, that, the, growing, food, justice, for, all, initiative, was, founded, with, the, mission, of, dismantling, racism, as, an, integral, part, of, creating, food, security, not, only, can, urban, agriculture, provide, healthy, fresh, food, options, but, also, can, contribute, to, a, sense, of, community, aesthetic, improvement, crime, reduction, minority, empowerment, and, autonomy, and, even, preserve, culture, through, the, use, of, farming, methods, and, heirloom, seeds, preserved, from, areas, of, origin, urban, agriculture, may, advance, environmental, justice, and, food, justice, for, communities, living, in, food, deserts, first, urban, agriculture, may, reduce, racial, and, class, disparities, in, access, to, healthy, food, when, urban, agriculture, leads, to, locally, grown, fresh, produce, sold, at, affordable, prices, in, food, deserts, access, to, healthy, food, is, not, just, available, for, those, who, live, in, wealthy, areas, thereby, leading, to, greater, equity, in, rich, and, poor, neighborhoods, improved, access, to, food, through, urban, agriculture, can, also, help, alleviate, psychosocial, stresses, in, poor, communities, community, members, engaged, in, urban, agriculture, improve, local, knowledge, about, healthy, ways, to, fulfill, dietary, needs, urban, agriculture, can, also, better, the, mental, health, of, community, members, buying, and, selling, quality, products, to, local, producers, and, consumers, allows, community, members, to, support, one, another, which, may, reduce, stress, thus, urban, agriculture, can, help, improve, conditions, in, poor, communities, where, residents, experience, higher, levels, of, stress, due, to, a, perceived, lack, of, control, over, the, quality, of, their, lives, urban, agriculture, may, improve, the, livability, and, built, environment, in, communities, that, lack, supermarkets, and, other, infrastructure, due, to, the, presence, of, high, unemployment, caused, by, deindustrialization, urban, farmers, who, follow, sustainable, agricultural, methods, can, not, only, help, to, build, local, food, system, infrastructure, but, can, also, contribute, to, improving, local, air, and, water, and, soil, quality, urban, farming, serves, as, one, type, of, green, space, in, urban, areas, it, has, a, positive, impact, on, the, air, quality, in, the, surrounding, area, a, case, study, conducted, on, a, rooftop, farm, shows, the, pm2, 5, concentration, in, the, urban, farming, area, is, 7, 33, lower, than, the, surrounding, parts, without, green, spaces, in, a, city, when, agricultural, products, are, produced, locally, within, the, community, they, do, not, need, to, be, transported, which, reduces, co, 2, emission, rates, and, other, pollutants, that, contribute, to, high, rates, of, asthma, in, lower, socioeconomic, areas, sustainable, urban, agriculture, can, also, promote, worker, protection, and, consumer, rights, for, example, communities, in, new, york, city, illinois, and, richmond, virginia, have, demonstrated, improvements, to, their, local, environments, through, urban, agricultural, practices, however, urban, agriculture, can, also, present, urban, growers, with, health, risks, if, the, soil, used, for, urban, farming, is, contaminated, lead, contamination, is, particularly, common, with, hazardous, levels, of, lead, found, in, soil, in, many, united, states, cities, high, lead, levels, in, soil, originate, from, sources, including, flaking, lead, paint, which, was, widely, used, before, being, banned, in, the, 1970s, vehicle, exhaust, and, atmospheric, deposition, without, proper, education, on, the, risks, of, urban, farming, and, safe, practices, urban, consumers, of, urban, agricultural, produce, may, face, additional, health, related, issues, creating, a, community, based, infrastructure, for, urban, agriculture, means, establishing, local, systems, to, grow, and, process, food, and, transfer, it, from, farmer, to, consumer, to, facilitate, food, production, cities, have, established, community, based, farming, projects, some, projects, have, collectively, tended, community, farms, on, common, land, much, like, that, of, the, eighteenth, century, boston, common, one, such, community, farm, is, the, collingwood, children, s, farm, in, melbourne, australia, other, community, garden, projects, use, the, allotment, garden, model, in, which, gardeners, care, for, individual, plots, in, a, larger, gardening, area, often, sharing, a, tool, shed, and, other, amenities, seattle, s, p, patch, gardens, use, this, model, as, did, the, south, central, farm, in, los, angeles, and, the, food, roof, farm, in, st, louis, independent, urban, gardeners, also, grow, food, in, individual, yards, and, on, roofs, garden, sharing, projects, seek, to, pair, producers, with, the, land, typically, residential, yard, space, roof, gardens, allow, for, urban, dwellers, to, maintain, green, spaces, in, the, city, without, having, to, set, aside, a, tract, of, undeveloped, land, rooftop, farms, allow, otherwise, unused, industrial, roofspace, to, be, used, productively, creating, work, and, profit, projects, around, the, world, seek, to, enable, cities, to, become, continuous, productive, landscapes, by, cultivating, vacant, urban, land, and, temporary, or, permanent, kitchen, gardens, food, processing, on, a, community, level, has, been, accommodated, by, centralizing, resources, in, community, tool, sheds, and, processing, facilities, for, farmers, to, share, the, garden, resource, program, collaborative, based, in, detroit, has, cluster, tool, banks, different, areas, of, the, city, have, tool, banks, where, resources, like, tools, compost, mulch, tomato, stakes, seeds, and, education, can, be, shared, and, distributed, with, the, gardeners, in, that, cluster, detroit, s, garden, resource, program, collaborative, also, strengthens, their, gardening, community, by, providing, access, to, their, member, s, transplants, education, on, gardening, policy, and, food, issues, and, by, building, connectivity, between, gardeners, through, workgroups, potlucks, tours, field, trips, and, cluster, workdays, in, brazil, cities, without, hunger, has, generated, a, public, policy, for, the, reconstruction, of, abandoned, areas, with, food, production, and, has, improved, the, green, areas, of, the, community, farmers, markets, such, as, the, farmers, market, in, los, angeles, provide, a, common, land, where, farmers, can, sell, their, product, to, consumers, large, cities, tend, to, open, their, farmer, s, markets, on, the, weekends, and, one, day, in, the, middle, of, the, week, for, example, the, farmers, market, of, boulevard, richard, lenoir, in, paris, france, is, open, on, sundays, and, thursdays, however, to, create, a, consumer, dependency, on, urban, agriculture, and, to, introduce, local, food, production, as, a, sustainable, career, for, farmers, markets, would, have, to, be, open, regularly, for, example, the, los, angeles, farmers, market, is, open, seven, days, a, week, and, has, linked, several, local, grocers, together, to, provide, different, food, products, the, market, s, central, location, in, downtown, los, angeles, provides, the, perfect, interaction, for, a, diverse, group, of, sellers, to, access, their, consumers, the, benefits, that, ua, brings, along, to, cities, that, implement, this, practice, are, numerous, the, transformation, of, cities, from, only, consumers, of, food, to, generators, of, agricultural, products, contributes, to, sustainability, improved, health, and, poverty, alleviation, a, large, part, of, the, people, involved, in, urban, agriculture, are, the, urban, poor, in, developing, countries, the, majority, of, urban, agricultural, production, is, for, self, consumption, with, surpluses, being, sold, in, the, market, according, to, the, fao, food, and, agriculture, organization, of, the, united, nations, urban, poor, consumers, spend, 60, 80, of, their, income, on, food, making, them, very, vulnerable, to, higher, food, prices, community, centers, and, gardens, educate, the, community, to, see, agriculture, as, an, integral, part, of, urban, life, the, florida, house, institute, for, sustainable, development, in, sarasota, florida, serves, as, a, public, community, and, education, center, in, which, innovators, with, sustainable, energy, saving, ideas, can, implement, and, test, them, community, centers, like, florida, house, integrate, agriculture, into, the, urban, lifestyle, by, providing, centralized, urban, areas, to, learn, about, urban, agriculture, and, food, production, urban, farms, also, are, also, a, proven, effective, educational, tool, to, teach, kids, about, healthy, eating, and, meaningful, physical, activity, municipal, greening, policy, goals, can, pose, conflicts, for, example, policies, promoting, urban, tree, canopy, are, not, sympathetic, to, vegetable, gardening, because, of, the, deep, shade, cast, by, trees, however, some, municipalities, like, portland, oregon, and, davenport, iowa, are, encouraging, the, implementation, of, fruit, bearing, trees, as, street, trees, or, as, park, orchards, to, meet, both, greening, and, food, production, goals
