a, memory, card, is, an, electronic, data, storage, device, used, for, storing, digital, information, typically, using, flash, memory, these, are, commonly, used, in, digital, portable, electronic, devices, such, as, digital, cameras, as, well, as, in, many, early, games, consoles, such, as, the, nintendo, wii, they, allow, adding, memory, to, such, devices, using, a, card, in, a, socket, instead, of, protruding, usb, flash, drives, common, types, of, flash, memory, card, include, sd, cards, including, microsd, sony, s, memory, stick, and, compactflash, as, of, 2024, sd, cards, are, the, most, common, type, of, memory, cards, the, basis, for, memory, card, technology, is, flash, memory, it, was, invented, by, fujio, masuoka, at, toshiba, in, 1980, and, commercialized, by, toshiba, in, 1987, the, development, of, memory, cards, was, driven, in, the, 1980s, by, the, need, for, an, alternative, to, floppy, disk, drives, that, had, lower, power, consumption, had, less, weight, and, occupied, less, volume, in, laptops, some, were, also, marketed, as, a, lower, cost, alternative, to, rom, cartridges, several, competing, and, incompatible, memory, card, formats, were, developed, by, several, vendors, such, as, for, example, the, bee, card, astron, softcards, sega, cards, nec, ultralite, memory, cards, and, the, mitsubishi, melcard, which, came, in, variants, using, 60, and, 50, connector, pins, the, sega, card, was, developed, as, a, cheaper, alternative, to, game, cartridges, some, memory, cards, were, used, for, memory, expansion, in, laptops, jeida, the, japan, electronic, industry, development, association, began, to, work, on, a, standard, for, memory, cards, in, 1985, and, developed, the, jeida, memory, card, in, 1986, the, personal, computer, memory, card, international, association, pcmcia, was, an, industry, association, created, in, 1989, to, promote, a, standard, for, memory, cards, in, pcs, and, worked, closely, with, jeida, adopting, their, 68, pin, connector, design, the, specification, for, pcmcia, type, i, cards, later, renamed, pc, cards, was, first, released, in, 1990, and, unified, the, jeida, memory, card, standard, with, the, pc, card, standard, this, format, later, included, support, for, other, devices, besides, memory, cards, pc, card, was, among, the, first, commercial, memory, card, formats, to, come, out, but, is, mainly, used, in, industrial, applications, and, to, connect, i, o, devices, such, as, modems, some, early, memory, cards, used, sram, as, a, storage, medium, which, required, a, lithium, battery, to, keep, the, contents, in, the, sram, these, cards, were, faster, than, their, flash, counterparts, some, of, the, first, pcmcia, cards, had, capacities, of, 1, to, 5, mb, and, cost, us, 100, per, mb, other, early, cards, such, as, the, bee, card, contained, non, modifiable, rom, write, once, read, many, eprom, or, rewriteable, eeprom, memory, in, 1992, sandisk, introduced, flashdisk, a, pcmcia, card, and, one, of, the, first, memory, cards, that, did, not, require, battery, power, to, retain, its, contents, as, it, used, flash, memory, in, 1994, memory, card, formats, smaller, than, the, pc, card, arrived, the, first, one, was, compactflash, and, later, smartmedia, and, miniature, card, the, desire, for, smaller, cards, for, cell, phones, pdas, and, compact, digital, cameras, drove, a, trend, that, left, the, previous, generation, of, compact, cards, looking, big, in, 2000, the, sd, card, was, announced, sd, was, envisioned, as, a, single, memory, card, format, for, several, kinds, of, electronic, devices, that, could, also, function, as, an, expansion, slot, for, adding, new, capabilities, for, a, device, in, 2001, smartmedia, alone, captured, 50, of, the, digital, camera, market, and, cf, had, captured, the, professional, digital, camera, market, however, by, 2005, sd, and, similar, mmc, cards, had, nearly, taken, over, smartmedia, s, spot, though, not, to, the, same, level, and, with, stiff, competition, coming, from, memory, stick, variants, as, well, as, compactflash, in, industrial, and, embedded, fields, even, the, venerable, pc, card, pcmcia, memory, cards, still, manage, to, maintain, a, niche, while, in, mobile, phones, and, pdas, the, memory, card, has, become, smaller, initially, memory, cards, were, expensive, costing, us, 3, per, megabyte, of, capacity, in, 2001, this, led, to, the, development, of, miniaturized, rotating, disk, memory, devices, such, as, the, microdrive, pocketzip, and, dataplay, the, microdrive, had, higher, capacities, than, memory, cards, at, the, time, all, three, concepts, became, obsolete, once, flash, memory, prices, became, lower, and, their, capacities, became, higher, by, 2006, new, products, of, sony, previously, only, using, memory, stick, and, olympus, previously, only, using, xd, card, have, been, offered, with, an, additional, sd, card, slot, beginning, in, 2010, effectively, the, format, war, has, turned, in, sd, card, s, favor, full, duplex, many, older, video, game, consoles, used, memory, cards, to, hold, saved, game, data, cartridge, based, systems, primarily, used, battery, backed, volatile, ram, within, each, individual, cartridge, to, hold, saves, for, that, game, cartridges, without, this, ram, may, have, used, a, password, system, or, would, not, save, progress, at, all, the, neo, geo, aes, released, in, 1990, by, snk, was, the, first, video, game, console, able, to, use, a, memory, card, aes, memory, cards, were, also, compatible, with, neo, geo, mvs, arcade, cabinets, allowing, players, to, migrate, saves, between, home, and, arcade, systems, and, vice, versa, memory, cards, became, commonplace, when, home, consoles, moved, to, read, only, optical, discs, for, storing, the, game, program, beginning, with, systems, such, as, the, turbografx, cd, and, sega, cd, until, the, sixth, generation, of, video, game, consoles, memory, cards, were, based, on, proprietary, formats, later, systems, used, established, industry, formats, for, memory, cards, such, as, fat32, home, consoles, commonly, use, hard, disk, drive, storage, for, saved, games, and, allow, the, use, of, usb, flash, drives, or, other, card, formats, via, a, memory, card, reader, to, transport, game, saves, and, other, game, information, though, some, consoles, have, implemented, cloud, storage, saving, most, portable, gaming, systems, still, rely, on, custom, memory, cartridges, to, store, program, data, due, to, their, low, power, consumption, smaller, physical, size, and, reduced, mechanical, complexity
