a, bomber, is, a, military, combat, aircraft, that, utilizes, air, to, ground, weaponry, to, drop, bombs, launch, torpedoes, or, deploy, air, launched, cruise, missiles, bombs, were, first, dropped, from, an, aircraft, during, the, italo, turkish, war, with, the, first, major, deployments, coming, in, the, first, world, war, and, second, world, war, by, all, major, airforces, damaging, cities, towns, and, rural, areas, the, first, bomber, planes, in, history, were, the, italian, caproni, ca, 30, and, british, bristol, t, b, 8, both, of, 1913, some, bombers, were, decorated, with, nose, art, or, victory, markings, there, are, two, major, classifications, of, bomber, strategic, and, tactical, strategic, bombing, is, done, by, heavy, bombers, primarily, designed, for, long, range, bombing, missions, against, strategic, targets, to, diminish, the, enemy, s, ability, to, wage, war, by, limiting, access, to, resources, through, crippling, infrastructure, reducing, industrial, output, or, inflicting, massive, civilian, casualties, to, an, extent, deemed, to, force, surrender, tactical, bombing, is, aimed, at, countering, enemy, military, activity, and, in, supporting, offensive, operations, and, is, typically, assigned, to, smaller, aircraft, operating, at, shorter, ranges, typically, near, the, troops, on, the, ground, or, against, enemy, shipping, during, wwii, with, engine, power, as, a, major, limitation, combined, with, the, desire, for, accuracy, and, other, operational, factors, bomber, designs, tended, to, be, tailored, to, specific, roles, early, in, the, cold, war, however, bombers, were, the, only, means, of, carrying, nuclear, weapons, to, enemy, targets, and, held, the, role, of, deterrence, with, the, advent, of, guided, air, to, air, missiles, bombers, needed, to, avoid, interception, high, speed, and, high, altitude, flying, became, a, means, of, evading, detection, and, attack, with, the, advent, of, icbms, the, role, of, the, bomber, was, brought, to, a, more, tactical, focus, in, close, air, support, roles, and, a, focus, on, stealth, technology, for, strategic, bombers, strategic, bombing, is, done, by, heavy, bombers, primarily, designed, for, long, range, bombing, missions, against, strategic, targets, such, as, supply, bases, bridges, factories, shipyards, and, cities, themselves, to, diminish, the, enemy, s, ability, to, wage, war, by, limiting, access, to, resources, through, crippling, infrastructure, or, reducing, industrial, output, current, examples, include, the, strategic, nuclear, armed, bombers, b, 2, spirit, b, 52, stratofortress, tupolev, tu, 95, bear, tupolev, tu, 22m, backfire, and, tupolev, tu, 160, blackjack, historically, notable, examples, are, the, gotha, g, iv, avro, lancaster, heinkel, he, 111, junkers, ju, 88, boeing, b, 17, flying, fortress, consolidated, b, 24, liberator, boeing, b, 29, superfortress, and, tupolev, tu, 16, badger, tactical, bombing, aimed, at, countering, enemy, military, activity, and, in, supporting, offensive, operations, is, typically, assigned, to, smaller, aircraft, operating, at, shorter, ranges, typically, near, the, troops, on, the, ground, or, against, enemy, shipping, this, role, is, filled, by, tactical, bomber, class, which, crosses, and, blurs, with, various, other, aircraft, categories, light, bombers, medium, bombers, dive, bombers, interdictors, fighter, bombers, attack, aircraft, multirole, combat, aircraft, and, others, the, first, use, of, an, air, dropped, bomb, actually, four, hand, grenades, specially, manufactured, by, the, italian, naval, arsenal, was, carried, out, by, italian, second, lieutenant, giulio, gavotti, on, 1, november, 1911, during, the, italo, turkish, war, in, libya, although, his, plane, was, not, designed, for, the, task, of, bombing, and, his, improvised, attacks, on, ottoman, positions, had, little, impact, these, picric, acid, filled, steel, spheres, were, nicknamed, ballerinas, from, the, fluttering, fabric, ribbons, attached, on, 16, october, 1912, bulgarian, observer, prodan, tarakchiev, dropped, two, of, those, bombs, on, the, turkish, railway, station, of, kara, a, near, the, besieged, edirne, from, an, albatros, f, 2, aircraft, piloted, by, radul, milkov, during, the, first, balkan, war, this, is, deemed, to, be, the, first, use, of, an, aircraft, as, a, bomber, the, first, heavier, than, air, aircraft, purposely, designed, for, bombing, were, the, italian, caproni, ca, 30, and, british, bristol, t, b, 8, both, of, 1913, the, bristol, t, b, 8, was, an, early, british, single, engined, biplane, built, by, the, bristol, aeroplane, company, they, were, fitted, with, a, prismatic, bombsight, in, the, front, cockpit, and, a, cylindrical, bomb, carrier, in, the, lower, forward, fuselage, capable, of, carrying, twelve, 10, lb, 4, 5, kg, bombs, which, could, be, dropped, singly, or, as, a, salvo, as, required, the, aircraft, was, purchased, for, use, both, by, the, royal, naval, air, service, and, the, royal, flying, corps, rfc, and, three, t, b, 8s, that, were, being, displayed, in, paris, during, december, 1913, fitted, with, bombing, equipment, were, sent, to, france, following, the, outbreak, of, war, under, the, command, of, charles, rumney, samson, a, bombing, attack, on, german, gun, batteries, at, middelkerke, belgium, was, executed, on, 25, november, 1914, the, dirigible, or, airship, was, developed, in, the, early, 20th, century, early, airships, were, prone, to, disaster, but, slowly, the, airship, became, more, dependable, with, a, more, rigid, structure, and, stronger, skin, prior, to, the, outbreak, of, war, zeppelins, a, larger, and, more, streamlined, form, of, airship, designed, by, german, count, ferdinand, von, zeppelin, were, outfitted, to, carry, bombs, to, attack, targets, at, long, range, these, were, the, first, long, range, strategic, bombers, although, the, german, air, arm, was, strong, with, a, total, of, 123, airships, by, the, end, of, the, war, they, were, vulnerable, to, attack, and, engine, failure, as, well, as, navigational, issues, german, airships, inflicted, little, damage, on, all, 51, raids, with, 557, britons, killed, and, 1, 358, injured, the, german, navy, lost, 53, of, its, 73, airships, and, the, german, army, lost, 26, of, its, 50, ships, the, caproni, ca, 30, was, built, by, gianni, caproni, in, italy, it, was, a, twin, boom, biplane, with, three, 67, kw, 80, hp, gnome, rotary, engines, and, first, flew, in, october, 1914, test, flights, revealed, power, to, be, insufficient, and, the, engine, layout, unworkable, and, caproni, soon, adopted, a, more, conventional, approach, installing, three, 81, kw, 110, hp, fiat, a, 10s, the, improved, design, was, bought, by, the, italian, army, and, it, was, delivered, in, quantity, from, august, 1915, while, mainly, used, as, a, trainer, avro, 504s, were, also, briefly, used, as, bombers, at, the, start, of, the, first, world, war, by, the, royal, naval, air, service, rnas, when, they, were, used, for, raids, on, the, german, airship, sheds, bombing, raids, and, interdiction, operations, were, mainly, carried, out, by, french, and, british, forces, during, the, war, as, the, german, air, arm, was, forced, to, concentrate, its, resources, on, a, defensive, strategy, notably, bombing, campaigns, formed, a, part, of, the, british, offensive, at, the, battle, of, neuve, chapelle, in, 1915, with, royal, flying, corps, squadrons, attacking, german, railway, stations, in, an, attempt, to, hinder, the, logistical, supply, of, the, german, army, the, early, improvised, attempts, at, bombing, that, characterized, the, early, part, of, the, war, slowly, gave, way, to, a, more, organized, and, systematic, approach, to, strategic, and, tactical, bombing, pioneered, by, various, air, power, strategists, of, the, entente, especially, major, hugh, trenchard, he, was, the, first, to, advocate, that, there, should, be, sustained, attacks, with, a, view, to, interrupting, the, enemy, s, railway, communications, in, conjunction, with, the, main, operations, of, the, allied, armies, when, the, war, started, bombing, was, very, crude, hand, held, bombs, were, thrown, over, the, side, yet, by, the, end, of, the, war, long, range, bombers, equipped, with, complex, mechanical, bombing, computers, were, being, built, designed, to, carry, large, loads, to, destroy, enemy, industrial, targets, the, most, important, bombers, used, in, world, war, i, were, the, french, breguet, 14, british, de, havilland, dh, 4, german, albatros, c, iii, and, russian, sikorsky, ilya, muromets, the, russian, sikorsky, ilya, muromets, was, the, first, four, engine, bomber, to, equip, a, dedicated, strategic, bombing, unit, during, world, war, i, this, heavy, bomber, was, unrivaled, in, the, early, stages, of, the, war, as, the, central, powers, had, no, comparable, aircraft, until, much, later, long, range, bombing, raids, were, carried, out, at, night, by, multi, engine, biplanes, such, as, the, gotha, g, iv, whose, name, was, synonymous, with, all, multi, engine, german, bombers, and, later, the, handley, page, type, o, the, majority, of, bombing, was, done, by, single, engined, biplanes, with, one, or, two, crew, members, flying, short, distances, to, attack, enemy, lines, and, immediate, hinterland, as, the, effectiveness, of, a, bomber, was, dependent, on, the, weight, and, accuracy, of, its, bomb, load, ever, larger, bombers, were, developed, starting, in, world, war, i, while, considerable, money, was, spent, developing, suitable, bombsights, with, engine, power, as, a, major, limitation, combined, with, the, desire, for, accuracy, and, other, operational, factors, bomber, designs, tended, to, be, tailored, to, specific, roles, by, the, start, of, the, war, this, included, bombers, of, this, era, were, not, intended, to, attack, other, aircraft, although, most, were, fitted, with, defensive, weapons, world, war, ii, saw, the, beginning, of, the, widespread, use, of, high, speed, bombers, which, began, to, minimize, defensive, weaponry, in, order, to, attain, higher, speed, some, smaller, designs, were, used, as, the, basis, for, night, fighters, a, number, of, fighters, such, as, the, hawker, hurricane, were, used, as, ground, attack, aircraft, replacing, earlier, conventional, light, bombers, that, proved, unable, to, defend, themselves, while, carrying, a, useful, bomb, load, at, the, start, of, the, cold, war, bombers, were, the, only, means, of, carrying, nuclear, weapons, to, enemy, targets, and, had, the, role, of, deterrence, with, the, advent, of, guided, air, to, air, missiles, bombers, needed, to, avoid, interception, high, speed, and, high, altitude, flying, became, a, means, of, evading, detection, and, attack, designs, such, as, the, english, electric, canberra, could, fly, faster, or, higher, than, contemporary, fighters, when, surface, to, air, missiles, became, capable, of, hitting, high, flying, bombers, bombers, were, flown, at, low, altitudes, to, evade, radar, detection, and, interception, once, stand, off, nuclear, weapon, designs, were, developed, bombers, did, not, need, to, pass, over, the, target, to, make, an, attack, they, could, fire, and, turn, away, to, escape, the, blast, nuclear, strike, aircraft, were, generally, finished, in, bare, metal, or, anti, flash, white, to, minimize, absorption, of, thermal, radiation, from, the, flash, of, a, nuclear, explosion, the, need, to, drop, conventional, bombs, remained, in, conflicts, with, non, nuclear, powers, such, as, the, vietnam, war, or, malayan, emergency, the, development, of, large, strategic, bombers, stagnated, in, the, later, part, of, the, cold, war, because, of, spiraling, costs, and, the, development, of, the, intercontinental, ballistic, missile, icbm, which, was, felt, to, have, similar, deterrent, value, while, being, impossible, to, intercept, because, of, this, the, united, states, air, force, xb, 70, valkyrie, program, was, cancelled, in, the, early, 1960s, the, later, b, 1b, lancer, and, b, 2, spirit, aircraft, entered, service, only, after, protracted, political, and, development, problems, their, high, cost, meant, that, few, were, built, and, the, 1950s, designed, b, 52s, are, projected, to, remain, in, use, until, the, 2040s, similarly, the, soviet, union, used, the, intermediate, range, tu, 22m, backfire, in, the, 1970s, but, their, mach, 3, bomber, project, stalled, the, mach, 2, tu, 160, blackjack, was, built, only, in, tiny, numbers, leaving, the, 1950s, tupolev, tu, 16, and, tu, 95, bear, heavy, bombers, to, continue, being, used, into, the, 21st, century, the, british, strategic, bombing, force, largely, came, to, an, end, when, the, v, bomber, force, was, phased, out, the, last, of, which, left, service, in, 1983, the, french, mirage, iv, bomber, version, was, retired, in, 1996, although, the, mirage, 2000n, and, the, rafale, have, taken, on, this, role, the, only, other, nation, that, fields, strategic, bombing, forces, is, china, which, has, a, number, of, xian, h, 6s, currently, only, the, united, states, air, force, the, russian, aerospace, forces, long, range, aviation, command, and, china, s, people, s, liberation, army, air, force, operate, strategic, heavy, bombers, other, air, forces, have, transitioned, away, from, dedicated, bombers, in, favor, of, multirole, combat, aircraft, at, present, these, air, forces, are, each, developing, stealth, replacements, for, their, legacy, bomber, fleets, the, usaf, with, the, northrop, grumman, b, 21, the, russian, aerospace, forces, with, the, pak, da, and, the, plaaf, with, the, xian, h, 20, as, of, 2021, the, b, 21, is, expected, to, enter, service, by, 2026, 2027, the, b, 21, would, be, capable, of, loitering, near, target, areas, for, extended, periods, of, time, occasionally, military, aircraft, have, been, used, to, bomb, ice, jams, with, limited, success, as, part, of, an, effort, to, clear, them, in, 2018, the, swedish, air, force, dropped, bombs, on, a, forest, fire, snuffing, out, flames, with, the, aid, of, the, blast, waves, the, fires, had, been, raging, in, an, area, contaminated, with, unexploded, ordnance, rendering, them, difficult, to, extinguish, for, firefighters
