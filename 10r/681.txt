a, traffic, collision, also, known, as, a, motor, vehicle, collision, or, car, crash, occurs, when, a, vehicle, collides, with, another, vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road, debris, or, other, moving, or, stationary, obstruction, such, as, a, tree, pole, or, building, traffic, collisions, often, result, in, injury, disability, death, and, property, damage, as, well, as, financial, costs, to, both, society, and, the, individuals, involved, road, transport, is, statistically, the, most, dangerous, situation, people, deal, with, on, a, daily, basis, but, casualty, figures, from, such, incidents, attract, less, media, attention, than, other, less, frequent, types, of, tragedy, the, commonly, used, term, car, accident, is, increasingly, falling, out, of, favor, with, many, government, departments, and, organizations, with, the, associated, press, style, guide, recommending, caution, before, using, the, term, some, collisions, are, intentional, vehicle, ramming, attacks, staged, crashes, vehicular, homicide, or, vehicular, suicide, several, factors, contribute, to, the, risk, of, collisions, including, vehicle, design, speed, of, operation, road, design, weather, road, environment, driving, skills, impairment, due, to, alcohol, or, drugs, and, behavior, notably, aggressive, driving, distracted, driving, speeding, and, street, racing, in, 2013, 54, million, people, worldwide, sustained, injuries, from, traffic, collisions, this, resulted, in, 1, 4, million, deaths, in, 2013, up, from, 1, 1, million, deaths, in, 1990, about, 68, 000, of, these, occurred, with, children, less, than, five, years, old, almost, all, high, income, countries, have, decreasing, death, rates, while, the, majority, of, low, income, countries, have, increasing, death, rates, due, to, traffic, collisions, middle, income, countries, have, the, highest, rate, with, 20, deaths, per, 100, 000, inhabitants, accounting, for, 80, of, all, road, fatalities, with, 52, of, all, vehicles, while, the, death, rate, in, africa, is, the, highest, 24, 1, per, 100, 000, inhabitants, the, lowest, rate, is, to, be, found, in, europe, 10, 3, per, 100, 000, inhabitants, traffic, collisions, can, be, classified, by, general, types, types, of, collision, include, head, on, road, departure, rear, end, side, collisions, and, rollovers, many, different, terms, are, commonly, used, to, describe, vehicle, collisions, the, world, health, organization, uses, the, term, road, traffic, injury, while, the, u, s, census, bureau, uses, the, term, motor, vehicle, accidents, mva, and, transport, canada, uses, the, term, motor, vehicle, traffic, collision, mvtc, other, common, terms, include, auto, accident, car, accident, car, crash, car, smash, car, wreck, motor, vehicle, collision, mvc, personal, injury, collision, pic, road, accident, road, traffic, accident, rta, road, traffic, collision, rtc, and, road, traffic, incident, rti, as, well, as, more, unofficial, terms, including, smash, up, pile, up, and, fender, bender, many, organizations, companies, and, government, agencies, have, begun, to, avoid, the, term, accident, instead, preferring, terms, such, as, collision, crash, or, incident, this, is, because, the, term, accident, may, imply, that, there, is, no, one, to, blame, or, that, the, collision, was, unavoidable, whereas, most, traffic, collisions, are, the, result, of, driving, under, the, influence, excessive, speed, distractions, such, as, mobile, phones, other, risky, behavior, poor, road, design, or, other, preventable, factors, in, 1997, george, l, reagle, the, associate, administrator, for, motor, carriers, of, the, federal, motor, carrier, safety, administration, wrote, a, letter, stating, that, a, crash, is, not, an, accident, emphasizing, that, the, department, s, research, and, special, programs, administration, the, federal, highway, administration, and, the, national, highway, traffic, safety, administration, had, all, declared, that, accident, should, be, avoided, in, their, published, writings, and, media, communications, in, 2016, the, associated, press, updated, its, style, guide, to, recommend, that, journalists, use, crash, collision, or, other, terms, rather, than, accident, unless, culpability, is, proven, the, ap, also, recommends, avoiding, accident, when, negligence, is, proven, or, claimed, because, the, term, can, be, read, as, exonerating, the, person, responsible, in, 2021, the, american, automobile, association, aaa, passed, a, resolution, to, replace, car, accident, with, car, crash, in, their, vocabulary, in, 2022, the, traffic, management, company, inrix, announced, that, accident, would, be, removed, from, their, lexicon, the, maryland, department, of, transportation, s, highway, safety, office, emphasizes, that, crashes, are, no, accident, saying, that, using, the, word, accident, suggests, that, an, incident, was, unavoidable, but, many, roadway, crashes, can, be, attributed, to, human, error, the, michigan, department, of, transportation, states, that, accident, should, be, dropped, in, favor, of, crash, saying, that, traffic, crashes, are, fixable, problems, caused, by, inattentive, drivers, and, driver, behavior, they, are, not, accidents, in, line, with, their, vision, zero, commitments, the, portland, bureau, of, transportation, recommends, using, crash, rather, than, accident, on, the, contrary, some, have, criticized, the, use, of, terminology, other, than, accident, for, holding, back, safety, improvements, based, on, the, idea, that, such, terms, perpetuate, a, culture, of, blame, that, may, discourage, the, involved, parties, from, fully, disclosing, the, facts, and, thus, frustrate, attempts, to, address, the, real, root, causes, some, traffic, collisions, are, caused, intentionally, by, a, driver, for, example, a, collision, may, be, caused, by, a, driver, who, intends, to, commit, vehicular, suicide, collisions, may, also, be, intentionally, caused, by, people, who, hope, to, make, an, insurance, claim, against, the, other, driver, or, may, be, staged, for, such, purposes, as, insurance, fraud, motor, vehicles, may, also, be, involved, in, collisions, as, part, of, a, deliberate, effort, to, hurt, other, people, such, as, in, a, vehicle, ramming, attack, or, vehicular, homicide, a, number, of, physical, injuries, can, commonly, result, from, the, blunt, force, trauma, caused, by, a, collision, ranging, from, bruising, and, contusions, to, catastrophic, physical, injury, e, g, paralysis, traumatic, or, non, traumatic, cardiac, arrest, and, death, the, cdc, estimates, that, roughly, 100, people, die, in, motor, vehicle, crashes, each, day, in, the, united, states, following, collisions, long, lasting, psychological, trauma, may, occur, these, issues, may, make, those, who, have, been, in, a, crash, afraid, to, drive, again, in, some, cases, psychological, trauma, may, affect, individuals, lives, causing, difficulty, going, to, work, attending, school, or, performing, family, responsibilities, road, incidents, are, caused, by, a, large, number, of, human, factors, such, as, failing, to, act, according, to, weather, conditions, road, design, signage, speed, limits, lighting, conditions, pavement, markings, and, roadway, obstacles, a, 1985, study, by, k, rumar, using, british, and, american, crash, reports, as, data, suggested, 57, of, crashes, were, due, solely, to, driver, factors, 27, to, the, combined, roadway, and, driver, factors, 6, to, the, combined, vehicle, and, driver, factors, 3, solely, to, roadway, factors, 3, to, combined, roadway, driver, and, vehicle, factors, 2, solely, to, vehicle, factors, and, 1, to, combined, roadway, and, vehicle, factors, reducing, the, severity, of, injury, in, crashes, is, more, important, than, reducing, incidence, and, ranking, incidence, by, broad, categories, of, causes, is, misleading, regarding, severe, injury, reduction, vehicle, and, road, modifications, are, generally, more, effective, than, behavioral, change, efforts, with, the, exception, of, certain, laws, such, as, required, use, of, seat, belts, motorcycle, helmets, and, graduated, licensing, of, teenagers, human, factors, in, vehicle, collisions, include, anything, related, to, drivers, and, other, road, users, that, may, contribute, to, a, collision, examples, include, driver, behavior, visual, and, auditory, acuity, decision, making, ability, and, reaction, speed, a, 1985, report, based, on, british, and, american, crash, data, found, driver, error, intoxication, and, other, human, factors, contribute, wholly, or, partly, to, about, 93, of, crashes, a, 2019, report, from, the, u, s, national, highway, traffic, safety, administration, found, that, leading, contributing, factors, for, fatal, crashes, included, driving, too, fast, for, conditions, or, in, excess, of, the, speed, limit, operating, under, the, influence, failure, to, yield, right, of, way, failure, to, keep, within, the, proper, lane, operating, a, vehicle, in, a, careless, manner, and, distracted, driving, drivers, distracted, by, mobile, devices, had, nearly, four, times, greater, risk, of, crashing, their, cars, than, those, who, were, not, research, from, the, virginia, tech, transportation, institute, has, found, that, drivers, who, are, texting, while, driving, are, 23, times, more, likely, to, be, involved, in, a, crash, as, non, texting, drivers, dialing, a, phone, is, the, most, dangerous, distraction, increasing, a, drivers, chance, of, crashing, by, 12, times, followed, by, reading, or, writing, which, increased, the, risk, by, ten, times, an, rac, survey, of, british, drivers, found, 78, of, drivers, thought, they, were, highly, skilled, at, driving, and, most, thought, they, were, better, than, other, drivers, a, result, suggesting, overconfidence, in, their, abilities, nearly, all, drivers, who, had, been, in, a, crash, did, not, believe, themselves, to, be, at, fault, one, survey, of, drivers, reported, that, they, thought, the, key, elements, of, good, driving, were, although, proficiency, in, these, skills, is, taught, and, tested, as, part, of, the, driving, exam, a, good, driver, can, still, be, at, a, high, risk, of, crashing, because, the, feeling, of, being, confident, in, more, and, more, challenging, situations, is, experienced, as, evidence, of, driving, ability, and, that, proven, ability, reinforces, the, feelings, of, confidence, confidence, feeds, itself, and, grows, unchecked, until, something, happens, a, near, miss, or, an, accident, an, axa, survey, concluded, irish, drivers, are, very, safety, conscious, relative, to, other, european, drivers, this, does, not, translate, to, significantly, lower, crash, rates, in, ireland, accompanying, changes, to, road, designs, have, been, wide, scale, adoptions, of, rules, of, the, road, alongside, law, enforcement, policies, that, included, drink, driving, laws, setting, of, speed, limits, and, speed, enforcement, systems, such, as, speed, cameras, some, countries, driving, tests, have, been, expanded, to, test, a, new, driver, s, behavior, during, emergencies, and, their, hazard, perception, there, are, demographic, differences, in, crash, rates, for, example, although, young, people, tend, to, have, good, reaction, times, disproportionately, more, young, male, drivers, feature, in, collisions, with, researchers, observing, that, many, exhibit, behaviors, and, attitudes, to, risk, that, can, place, them, in, more, hazardous, situations, than, other, road, users, this, is, reflected, by, actuaries, when, they, set, insurance, rates, for, different, age, groups, partly, based, on, their, age, sex, and, choice, of, vehicle, older, drivers, with, slower, reactions, might, be, expected, to, be, involved, in, more, collisions, but, this, has, not, been, the, case, as, they, tend, to, drive, less, and, apparently, more, cautiously, attempts, to, impose, traffic, policies, can, be, complicated, by, local, circumstances, and, driver, behavior, in, 1969, leeming, warned, that, there, is, a, balance, to, be, struck, when, improving, the, safety, of, a, road, conversely, a, location, that, does, not, look, dangerous, may, have, a, high, crash, frequency, this, is, in, part, because, if, drivers, perceive, a, location, as, hazardous, they, take, more, care, collisions, may, be, more, likely, to, happen, when, hazardous, road, or, traffic, conditions, are, not, obvious, at, a, glance, or, where, the, conditions, are, too, complicated, for, the, limited, human, machine, to, perceive, and, react, in, the, time, and, distance, available, high, incidence, of, crashes, is, not, indicative, of, high, injury, risk, crashes, are, common, in, areas, of, high, vehicle, congestion, but, fatal, crashes, occur, disproportionately, on, rural, roads, at, night, when, traffic, is, relatively, light, this, phenomenon, has, been, observed, in, risk, compensation, research, where, the, predicted, reductions, in, collision, rates, have, not, occurred, after, legislative, or, technical, changes, one, study, observed, that, the, introduction, of, improved, brakes, resulted, in, more, aggressive, driving, and, another, argued, that, compulsory, seat, belt, laws, have, not, been, accompanied, by, a, clearly, attributed, fall, in, overall, fatalities, most, claims, of, risk, compensation, offsetting, the, effects, of, vehicle, regulation, and, belt, use, laws, have, been, discredited, by, research, using, more, refined, data, in, the, 1990s, hans, monderman, s, studies, of, driver, behavior, led, him, to, the, realization, that, signs, and, regulations, had, an, adverse, effect, on, a, driver, s, ability, to, interact, safely, with, other, road, users, monderman, developed, shared, space, principles, rooted, in, the, principles, of, the, woonerven, of, the, 1970s, he, concluded, that, the, removal, of, highway, clutter, while, allowing, drivers, and, other, road, users, to, mingle, with, equal, priority, could, help, drivers, recognize, environmental, clues, they, relied, on, their, cognitive, skills, alone, reducing, traffic, speeds, radically, and, resulting, in, lower, levels, of, road, casualties, and, lower, levels, of, congestion, some, crashes, are, intended, staged, crashes, for, example, involve, at, least, one, party, who, hopes, to, crash, a, vehicle, in, order, to, submit, lucrative, claims, to, an, insurance, company, in, the, united, states, during, the, 1990s, criminals, recruited, latin, american, immigrants, to, deliberately, crash, cars, usually, by, cutting, in, front, of, another, car, and, slamming, on, the, brakes, it, was, an, illegal, and, risky, job, and, they, were, typically, paid, only, 100, jose, luis, lopez, perez, a, staged, crash, driver, died, after, one, such, maneuver, leading, to, an, investigation, that, uncovered, the, increasing, frequency, of, this, type, of, crash, the, u, s, department, of, transportation, s, federal, highway, administration, reviewed, research, on, traffic, speed, in, 1998, the, summary, says, in, the, u, s, in, 2018, 9, 378, people, were, killed, in, motor, vehicle, crashes, involving, at, least, one, speeding, driver, which, accounted, for, 26, of, all, traffic, related, deaths, for, the, year, in, michigan, in, 2019, excessive, speed, was, a, factor, in, 18, 8, of, the, fatalities, that, resulted, from, fatal, motor, vehicle, crashes, and, in, 15, 6, of, the, suspected, serious, injuries, resulting, from, crashes, the, road, and, traffic, authority, rta, of, the, australian, state, of, new, south, wales, nsw, asserts, speeding, traveling, too, fast, for, the, prevailing, conditions, or, above, the, posted, speed, limit, is, a, factor, in, about, 40, percent, of, road, deaths, the, rta, also, says, speeding, increases, the, risk, of, a, crash, and, its, severity, on, another, web, page, the, rta, qualifies, its, claims, by, referring, to, one, specific, piece, of, research, from, 1997, and, writes, research, has, shown, that, the, risk, of, a, crash, causing, death, or, injury, increases, rapidly, even, with, small, increases, above, an, appropriately, set, speed, limit, the, contributory, factor, report, in, the, official, british, road, casualty, statistics, shows, for, 2006, that, exceeding, the, speed, limit, was, a, contributory, factor, in, 5, of, all, casualty, crashes, 14, of, all, fatal, crashes, and, traveling, too, fast, for, conditions, was, a, contributory, factor, in, 11, of, all, casualty, crashes, 18, of, all, fatal, crashes, in, france, in, 2018, the, speed, limit, was, reduced, from, 90, km, h, to, 80, km, h, on, a, large, part, of, the, local, outside, built, up, area, road, network, in, the, sole, aim, of, reducing, the, number, of, road, fatalities, a, common, cause, of, collisions, is, driving, faster, than, one, can, stop, within, their, field, of, vision, such, practice, is, illegal, and, is, particularly, responsible, for, an, increase, in, fatalities, at, night, when, it, occurs, most, driver, impairment, describes, factors, that, prevent, the, driver, from, driving, at, their, normal, level, of, skill, common, impairments, include, females, in, this, age, group, exhibit, somewhat, lower, collision, and, fatality, rates, than, males, but, still, register, well, above, the, median, for, drivers, of, all, ages, also, within, this, group, the, highest, collision, incidence, rate, occurs, within, the, first, year, of, licensed, driving, for, this, reason, many, us, states, have, enacted, a, zero, tolerance, policy, wherein, receiving, a, moving, violation, within, the, first, six, months, to, one, year, of, obtaining, a, license, results, in, automatic, license, suspension, south, dakota, is, the, only, state, that, allows, fourteen, year, olds, to, obtain, drivers, licenses, various, factors, such, as, fatigue, or, sleep, deprivation, might, increase, the, risk, or, the, number, of, hours, of, driving, might, increase, the, risk, of, an, incident, 41, of, drivers, self, report, having, fallen, asleep, at, the, wheel, 41, it, is, estimated, that, 15, of, fatal, crashes, involve, drowsiness, 10, of, daytime, crashes, and, 24, of, nighttime, crashes, work, factors, can, increase, the, risk, of, drowsy, driving, such, as, long, or, irregular, hours, or, driving, at, night, cell, phone, use, is, an, increasingly, significant, problem, on, the, roads, and, the, u, s, national, safety, council, compiled, more, than, 30, studies, postulating, that, hands, free, is, not, a, safer, option, because, the, brain, remains, distracted, by, the, conversation, and, cannot, focus, solely, on, the, task, of, driving, several, conditions, can, combine, to, create, a, more, dangerous, situation, for, example, low, doses, of, alcohol, and, cannabis, have, a, more, severe, effect, on, driving, performance, than, either, in, isolation, taking, recommended, doses, of, several, drugs, together, which, individually, do, not, cause, impairment, may, cause, drowsiness, this, could, be, more, pronounced, in, an, elderly, person, whose, renal, function, is, less, efficient, than, a, younger, person, s, a, 1985, us, study, showed, that, about, 34, of, serious, crashes, had, contributing, factors, related, to, the, roadway, or, its, environment, most, of, these, crashes, also, involved, a, human, factor, the, road, or, environmental, factor, was, either, noted, as, making, a, significant, contribution, to, the, circumstances, of, the, crash, or, did, not, allow, room, to, recover, in, these, circumstances, it, is, frequently, the, driver, who, is, blamed, rather, than, the, road, those, reporting, the, collisions, have, a, tendency, to, overlook, the, human, factors, involved, such, as, the, subtleties, of, design, and, maintenance, that, a, driver, could, fail, to, observe, or, inadequately, compensate, for, research, has, shown, that, careful, design, and, maintenance, with, well, designed, intersections, road, surfaces, visibility, and, traffic, control, devices, can, result, in, significant, improvements, in, collision, rates, individual, roads, also, have, widely, differing, performance, in, the, event, of, an, impact, in, europe, there, are, now, eurorap, tests, that, indicate, how, self, explaining, and, forgiving, a, particular, road, and, its, roadside, would, be, in, the, event, of, a, major, incident, in, the, uk, research, has, shown, that, investment, in, a, safe, road, infrastructure, program, could, yield, a, 1, 3, reduction, in, road, deaths, saving, as, much, as, 6, billion, per, year, a, consortium, of, 13, major, road, safety, stakeholders, has, formed, the, campaign, for, safe, road, design, which, is, calling, on, the, uk, government, to, make, safe, road, design, a, national, transport, priority, research, has, shown, that, across, all, collision, types, it, is, less, likely, that, seat, belts, were, worn, in, collisions, involving, death, or, serious, injury, rather, than, light, injury, wearing, a, seat, belt, reduces, the, risk, of, death, by, about, 45, percent, seat, belt, use, is, controversial, with, notable, critics, such, as, professor, john, adams, suggesting, that, their, use, may, lead, to, a, net, increase, in, road, casualties, due, to, a, phenomenon, known, as, risk, compensation, observation, of, driver, behaviors, before, and, after, seat, belt, laws, does, not, support, the, risk, compensation, hypothesis, several, driving, behaviors, were, observed, on, the, road, before, and, after, the, belt, use, law, was, enforced, in, newfoundland, and, in, nova, scotia, during, the, same, period, without, a, law, belt, use, increased, from, 16, percent, to, 77, percent, in, newfoundland, and, remained, virtually, unchanged, in, nova, scotia, four, driver, behaviors, speed, stopping, at, intersections, when, the, control, light, was, amber, turning, left, in, front, of, oncoming, traffic, and, gaps, in, following, distance, were, measured, at, various, sites, before, and, after, the, law, changes, in, these, behaviors, in, newfoundland, were, similar, to, those, in, nova, scotia, except, that, drivers, in, newfoundland, drove, slower, on, expressways, after, the, law, contrary, to, the, risk, compensation, theory, a, well, designed, and, well, maintained, vehicle, with, good, brakes, tires, and, well, adjusted, suspension, will, be, more, controllable, in, an, emergency, and, thus, be, better, equipped, to, avoid, collisions, some, mandatory, vehicle, inspection, schemes, include, tests, for, some, aspects, of, roadworthiness, such, as, the, uk, s, mot, test, or, german, t, v, conformance, inspection, the, design, of, vehicles, has, also, evolved, to, improve, protection, after, collision, both, for, vehicle, occupants, and, for, those, outside, of, the, vehicle, much, of, this, work, was, led, by, automotive, industry, competition, and, technological, innovation, leading, to, measures, such, as, saab, s, safety, cage, and, reinforced, roof, pillars, of, 1946, ford, s, 1956, lifeguard, safety, package, and, saab, and, volvo, s, introduction, of, standard, fit, seatbelts, in, 1959, other, initiatives, were, accelerated, as, a, reaction, to, consumer, pressure, after, publications, such, as, ralph, nader, s, 1965, book, unsafe, at, any, speed, accused, motor, manufacturers, of, indifference, to, safety, in, the, early, 1970s, british, leyland, started, an, intensive, program, of, vehicle, safety, research, producing, a, number, of, prototype, experimental, safety, vehicles, demonstrating, various, innovations, for, occupant, and, pedestrian, protection, such, as, airbags, anti, lock, brakes, impact, absorbing, side, panels, front, and, rear, head, restraints, run, flat, tires, smooth, and, deformable, front, ends, impact, absorbing, bumpers, and, retractable, headlamps, the, design, has, also, been, influenced, by, government, legislation, such, as, the, euro, ncap, impact, test, common, features, designed, to, improve, safety, include, thicker, pillars, safety, glass, interiors, with, no, sharp, edges, stronger, bodies, other, active, or, passive, safety, features, and, smooth, exteriors, to, reduce, the, consequences, of, an, impact, on, pedestrians, the, uk, department, for, transport, publish, road, casualty, statistics, for, each, type, of, collision, and, vehicle, through, its, road, casualties, great, britain, report, these, statistics, show, a, ten, to, one, ratio, of, in, vehicle, fatalities, between, types, of, cars, in, most, cars, occupants, have, a, 2, 8, chance, of, death, in, a, two, car, collision, some, crash, types, tend, to, have, more, serious, consequences, rollovers, have, become, more, common, in, recent, years, perhaps, due, to, the, increased, popularity, of, taller, suvs, people, carriers, and, minivans, which, have, a, higher, center, of, gravity, than, standard, passenger, cars, rollovers, can, be, fatal, especially, if, the, occupants, are, ejected, because, they, were, not, wearing, seat, belts, 83, of, ejections, during, rollovers, were, fatal, when, the, driver, did, not, wear, a, seat, belt, compared, to, 25, when, they, did, after, a, first, generation, mercedes, benz, a, class, notoriously, failed, a, moose, test, sudden, swerving, to, avoid, an, obstacle, in, 1997, some, manufacturers, enhanced, suspension, using, stability, control, linked, to, an, anti, lock, braking, system, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, rollover, after, retrofitting, these, systems, to, its, models, in, 1999, 2000, mercedes, saw, its, models, involved, in, fewer, crashes, now, about, 40, of, new, us, vehicles, mainly, the, suvs, vans, and, pickup, trucks, that, are, more, susceptible, to, rollover, are, being, produced, with, a, lower, center, of, gravity, and, enhanced, suspension, with, stability, control, linked, to, its, anti, lock, braking, system, to, reduce, the, risk, of, rollover, and, meet, us, federal, requirements, that, mandate, anti, rollover, technology, by, september, 2011, motorcyclists, and, pillion, riders, have, little, protection, other, than, their, clothing, and, helmets, this, difference, is, reflected, in, the, casualty, statistics, where, they, are, more, than, twice, as, likely, to, suffer, severely, after, a, collision, in, 2005, there, were, 198, 735, road, crashes, with, 271, 017, reported, casualties, on, roads, in, great, britain, this, included, 3, 201, deaths, 1, 1, and, 28, 954, serious, injuries, 10, 7, overall, of, these, casualties, 178, 302, 66, were, car, users, and, 24, 824, 9, were, motorcyclists, of, whom, 569, were, killed, 2, 3, and, 5, 939, seriously, injured, 24, studies, in, united, states, have, shown, that, poor, people, have, a, greater, risk, of, dying, in, a, car, crash, than, people, who, are, well, off, car, deaths, are, also, higher, in, poorer, states, similar, studies, in, france, or, israel, have, shown, the, same, results, this, may, be, due, to, working, class, people, having, less, access, to, secure, equipment, in, cars, having, older, cars, which, are, less, protected, against, crash, and, needing, to, cover, more, distance, to, go, to, work, each, day, while, the, advent, of, the, covid, lockdown, meant, a, decrease, in, road, traffic, in, the, united, states, the, rates, of, incidents, speeding, and, traffic, fatalities, rose, in, 2020, and, 2021, rate, as, measured, against, vehicle, miles, traveled, the, traffic, fatality, rate, jumped, to, 1, 25, per, 100, million, vehicle, miles, traveled, up, from, 1, 06, during, the, same, period, in, 2019, reasons, cited, for, the, increases, are, greater, speeds, not, wearing, seatbelts, and, driving, while, impaired, in, their, preliminary, report, covering, the, first, six, months, of, 2021, the, us, nonprofit, public, safety, advocacy, group, the, national, safety, council, nsc, estimated, of, total, motor, vehicle, deaths, for, the, first, six, months, of, 2021, were, 21, 450, up, 16, from, 2020, and, up, 17, from, 18, 384, in, 2019, the, estimated, mileage, death, rate, in, 2021, was, 1, 43, deaths, per, 100, million, vehicle, miles, traveled, up, 3, from, 1, 39, in, 2020, and, up, 24, from, 1, 15, in, 2019, preliminary, data, also, show, that, even, as, traffic, levels, returned, to, normal, after, the, onset, of, covid, in, march, april, 2020, drivers, continued, to, drive, at, excessive, speeds, a, 2020, study, conducted, by, inrix, private, company, that, analyzes, traffic, patters, behaviors, and, congestion, showed, that, as, traffic, levels, returned, to, normal, during, the, three, month, period, august, to, october, 2020, growth, in, collisions, 57, outpaced, the, growth, in, miles, traveled, 22, resulting, in, a, higher, than, normal, collision, rate, during, this, period, in, france, the, ministry, of, interior, reported, that, traffic, incidents, crash, related, injuries, and, fatalities, dropped, in, 2020, compared, with, 2019, fatalities, dropped, 21, 4, injuries, dropped, 20, 9, and, incidents, overall, dropped, 20, it, also, reported, that, the, number, of, vehicles, on, the, road, dropped, by, 75, which, suggests, the, rate, incidents, per, vehicle, mile, increased, other, possibly, hazardous, factors, that, may, alter, a, driver, s, soundness, on, the, road, include, a, large, body, of, knowledge, has, been, amassed, on, how, to, prevent, car, crashes, and, reduce, the, severity, of, those, that, do, occur, owing, to, the, global, and, massive, scale, of, the, issue, with, predictions, that, by, 2020, road, traffic, deaths, and, injuries, will, exceed, hiv, aids, as, a, cause, of, death, and, disability, the, united, nations, and, its, subsidiary, bodies, have, passed, resolutions, and, held, conferences, on, the, issue, the, first, united, nations, general, assembly, resolution, and, debate, was, in, 2003, the, world, day, of, remembrance, for, road, traffic, victims, was, declared, in, 2005, in, 2009, the, first, high, level, ministerial, conference, on, road, safety, was, held, in, moscow, the, world, health, organization, a, specialized, agency, of, the, united, nations, organization, in, its, global, status, report, on, road, safety, 2009, estimates, that, over, 90, of, the, world, s, fatalities, on, the, roads, occur, in, low, income, and, middle, income, countries, which, have, only, 48, of, the, world, s, registered, vehicles, and, predicts, road, traffic, injuries, will, rise, to, become, the, fifth, leading, cause, of, death, by, 2030, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 3, target, 3, 6, is, directed, at, reducing, road, injuries, and, deaths, february, 2020, saw, a, global, ministerial, conference, which, brought, the, stockholm, declaration, setting, a, target, to, reduce, global, traffic, deaths, and, injuries, by, 50, within, ten, years, the, decade, of, 2021, 2030, was, declared, the, second, decade, of, road, safety, collisions, migration, refers, to, a, situation, where, action, to, reduce, road, traffic, collisions, in, one, place, may, result, in, those, collisions, resurfacing, elsewhere, for, example, an, accident, blackspot, may, occur, at, a, dangerous, bend, the, treatment, for, this, may, be, to, increase, signage, post, an, advisory, speed, limit, apply, a, high, friction, road, surface, add, crash, barriers, or, any, one, of, a, number, of, other, visible, interventions, the, immediate, result, may, be, to, reduce, collisions, at, the, bend, but, the, subconscious, relaxation, on, leaving, the, dangerous, bend, may, cause, drivers, to, act, with, fractionally, less, care, on, the, rest, of, the, road, resulting, in, an, increase, in, collisions, elsewhere, on, the, road, and, no, overall, improvement, over, the, area, in, the, same, way, increasing, familiarity, with, the, treated, area, will, often, result, in, a, reduction, over, time, to, the, previous, level, of, care, and, may, result, in, faster, speeds, around, the, bend, due, to, perceived, increased, safety, risk, compensation, in, 2004, 50, million, more, were, injured, in, motor, vehicle, collisions, in, 2013, between, 1, 25, million, and, 1, 4, million, people, were, killed, in, traffic, collisions, up, from, 1, 1, million, deaths, in, 1990, that, number, represents, about, 2, 5, of, all, deaths, approximately, 50, million, additional, people, were, injured, in, traffic, collisions, a, number, unchanged, from, 2004, india, recorded, 105, 000, traffic, deaths, in, a, year, followed, by, china, with, over, 96, 000, deaths, this, makes, motor, vehicle, collisions, the, leading, cause, of, injury, and, death, among, children, worldwide, 10, 19, years, old, 260, 000, children, die, a, year, 10, million, are, injured, and, the, sixth, leading, preventable, cause, of, death, in, the, united, states, in, 2019, there, were, 36, 096, people, killed, and, 2, 74, million, people, injured, in, motor, vehicle, traffic, crashes, on, roadways, in, the, united, states, in, the, state, of, texas, alone, there, were, a, total, of, 415, 892, traffic, collisions, including, 3, 005, fatal, crashes, in, 2012, in, canada, they, are, the, cause, of, 48, of, severe, injuries, the, safety, performance, of, roadways, is, almost, always, reported, as, a, rate, that, is, some, measure, of, harm, deaths, injuries, or, number, of, crashes, divided, by, some, measure, of, exposure, to, the, risk, of, this, harm, rates, are, used, so, the, safety, performance, of, different, locations, can, be, compared, and, to, prioritize, safety, improvements, common, rates, related, to, road, traffic, fatalities, include, the, number, of, deaths, per, capita, per, registered, vehicle, per, licensed, driver, or, per, vehicle, mile, or, kilometer, traveled, simple, counts, are, almost, never, used, the, annual, count, of, fatalities, is, a, rate, namely, the, number, of, fatalities, per, year, there, is, no, one, rate, that, is, superior, to, others, in, any, general, sense, it, depends, on, the, question, asked, and, the, available, data, some, agencies, concentrate, on, crashes, per, total, vehicle, distance, traveled, and, others, combine, rates, iowa, for, example, selects, high, collision, locations, based, on, a, combination, of, crashes, per, million, miles, traveled, crashes, per, mile, per, year, and, value, loss, crash, severity, the, definition, of, a, road, traffic, fatality, varies, from, country, to, country, in, the, united, states, the, definition, used, in, the, fatality, analysis, reporting, system, fars, run, by, the, national, highway, traffic, safety, administration, nhtsa, is, a, person, who, dies, within, 30, days, of, a, crash, on, a, us, public, road, involving, a, vehicle, with, an, engine, the, death, being, the, result, of, the, crash, in, the, u, s, therefore, if, a, driver, has, a, non, fatal, heart, attack, that, leads, to, a, road, traffic, crash, that, causes, death, that, is, a, road, traffic, fatality, if, the, heart, attack, causes, death, prior, to, the, crash, it, is, not, a, road, traffic, fatality, the, definition, of, a, road, traffic, fatality, can, change, with, time, in, the, same, country, for, example, fatality, was, defined, in, france, as, a, person, who, dies, in, the, six, days, pre, 2005, after, the, collision, and, was, subsequently, changed, to, the, 30, days, post, 2005, after, the, collision, the, world, s, first, recorded, road, traffic, death, involving, a, motor, vehicle, occurred, on, 31, august, 1869, irish, scientist, mary, ward, died, when, she, fell, out, of, her, cousins, steam, car, and, was, run, over, by, it, the, british, road, engineer, j, j, leeming, compared, the, statistics, for, fatality, rates, in, great, britain, for, transport, related, incidents, both, before, and, after, the, introduction, of, the, motor, vehicle, for, journeys, including, those, once, by, water, that, now, are, undertaken, by, motor, vehicle, for, the, period, 1863, 1870, there, were, 470, fatalities, per, million, of, population, 76, on, railways, 143, on, roads, 251, on, water, for, the, period, 1891, 1900, the, corresponding, figures, were, 348, 63, 107, 178, for, the, period, 1931, 1938, 403, 22, 311, 70, and, for, the, year, 1963, 325, 10, 278, 37, leeming, concluded, that, the, data, showed, that, travel, accidents, may, even, have, been, more, frequent, a, century, ago, than, they, are, now, at, least, for, men, he, also, compared, the, circumstances, around, road, deaths, as, reported, in, various, american, states, before, the, widespread, introduction, of, 55, mph, 89, km, h, speed, limits, and, drunk, driving, laws, they, took, into, account, thirty, factors, which, it, was, thought, might, affect, the, death, rate, among, these, were, included, the, annual, consumption, of, wine, of, spirits, and, of, malt, beverages, taken, individually, the, amount, spent, on, road, maintenance, the, minimum, temperature, certain, of, the, legal, measures, such, as, the, amount, spent, on, police, the, number, of, police, per, 100, 000, inhabitants, the, follow, up, programme, on, dangerous, drivers, the, quality, of, driver, testing, and, so, on, the, thirty, factors, were, finally, reduced, to, six, by, eliminating, those, found, to, have, small, or, negligible, effect, the, final, six, were, these, are, placed, in, descending, order, of, importance, these, six, accounted, for, 70, of, the, variations, in, the, rate, united, states, judges, prioritized, pedestrians, rights, in, city, streets, when, early, 20th, century, automobiles, appeared, pedestrian, injuries, were, regarded, as, the, fault, of, a, motorist, driving, too, fast, as, automobile, ownership, increased, the, rate, of, traffic, deaths, in, the, united, states, doubled, from, 1915, to, 1921, when, it, reached, 12, deaths, per, 100, 000, americans, the, right, to, walk, was, considered, dispensable, a, century, later,

account, for, 1, 0, to, 2, 0, of, the, gross, national, product, gnp, of, every, country, each, year, a, recent, study, from, nepal, showed, that, the, total, economic, costs, of, road, injuries, were, approximately, 122, 88, million, equivalent, to, 1, 52, of, the, total, nepal, gnp, for, 2017, indicating, the, growing, national, financial, burden, associate, with, preventable, road, injuries, and, deaths, the, economic, cost, to, the, individuals, involved, in, an, mvc, varies, widely, depending, on, geographic, distribution, and, varies, largely, on, depth, of, accident, insurance, cover, and, legislative, policy, in, the, uk, for, example, a, survey, conducted, using, 500, post, accident, insurance, policy, customers, showed, an, average, individual, financial, loss, of, 1300, 00, this, is, due, in, part, to, voluntary, excesses, that, are, common, tactics, used, to, reduce, overall, premium, and, in, part, due, to, under, valuation, of, vehicles, by, contrast,

action, protocol, for, low, value, personal, injury, claims, in, road, traffic, accidents, from, 31, july, 2013, otherwise, known, as, the, rta, protocol, describes, the, behaviour, the, court, expects, of, the, parties, prior, to, the, start, of, proceedings, where, a, claimant, claims, damages, valued, at, no, more, than, the, protocol, upper, limit, as, a, result, of, a, personal, injury, sustained, by, that, person, in, a, road, traffic, accident, as, of, february, 2022, the, upper, limit, is, 25, 000, for, an, accident, which, occurred, on, or, after, 31, july, 2013, the, limit, under, a, previous, version, of, the, protocol, was, 10, 000, for, an, accident, which, had, occurred, on, or, after, 30, april, 2010, but, before, 31, july, 2013, motor, vehicle, crashes, are, the, leading, cause, of, death, in, the, workplace, in, the, united, states, accounting, for, 35, percent, of, all, workplace, fatalities, in, the, united, states, individuals, involved, in, motor, vehicle, collisions, may, be, held, financially, liable, for, the, consequences, of, a, collision, including, property, damage, and, injuries, to, passengers, and, drivers, where, another, driver, s, vehicle, is, damaged, as, the, result, of, a, crash, some, states, allow, the, owner, of, the, vehicle, to, recover, both, the, cost, of, repair, for, the, diminished, value, of, the, vehicle, from, the, at, fault, driver, because, the, financial, liability, that, results, from, causing, a, crash, is, so, high, most, u, s, states, require, drivers, to, carry, liability, insurance, to, cover, these, potential, costs, in, the, event, of, serious, injuries, or, fatalities, it, is, possible, for, injured, persons, to, seek, compensation, in, excess, of, the, at, fault, driver, s, insurance, coverage, liability, rules, vary, from, state, to, state, with, some, laws, adopting, a, tort, system, and, others, a, no, fault, insurance, system, most, use, a, tort, based, system, wherein, injured, people, seek, financial, compensation, from, at, fault, parties, insurance, carriers, twelve, states, take, the, no, fault, approach, where, injured, parties, file, their, primary, claims, with, their, own, insurer, tort, reform, has, changed, the, legal, landscape, for, example, michigan, had, a, unique, no, fault, system, that, guaranteed, lifetime, benefits, for, people, injured, in, motor, vehicle, collisions, this, changed, in, 2020, when, the, state, legislature, amended, the, laws, allowing, people, to, opt, for, less, coverage, while, the, aim, of, these, laws, is, to, reduce, the, cost, of, insurance, premiums, catastrophically, injured, claimants, might, find, themselves, underinsured, in, some, cases, involving, a, defect, in, the, design, or, manufacture, of, motor, vehicles, such, as, where, defective, design, results, in, suv, rollovers, or, sudden, unintended, acceleration, crashes, caused, by, defective, tires, or, where, injuries, are, caused, or,

of, ownership, coupled, with, the, freedom, of, the, road, the, violence, of, a, car, wreck, provides, a, counterpoint, to, that, promise, and, is, the, subject, of, artwork, by, a, number, of, artists, such, as, john, salt, and, li, yan, though, english, john, salt, was, drawn, to, american, landscapes, of, wrecked, vehicles, like, desert, wreck, airbrushed, oil, on, linen, 1972, similarly,
