a, ruler, sometimes, called, a, rule, scale, or, a, line, gauge, is, an, instrument, used, to, make, length, measurements, whereby, a, user, estimates, a, length, by, reading, from, a, series, of, markings, called, rules, along, an, edge, of, the, device, usually, the, instrument, is, rigid, and, the, edge, itself, is, a, straightedge, ruled, straightedge, which, additionally, allows, one, to, draw, straight, lines, some, rulers, such, as, cloth, or, paper, tape, measures, are, non, rigid, specialty, rulers, exist, that, have, flexible, edges, that, retain, a, chosen, shape, these, find, use, in, sewing, arts, and, crafts, rulers, have, been, used, since, ancient, times, they, are, commonly, made, from, metal, wood, fabric, paper, and, plastic, they, are, important, tools, in, the, design, and, construction, of, buildings, their, ability, to, quickly, and, easily, measure, lengths, makes, them, important, in, the, textile, industry, and, in, the, retail, trade, where, lengths, of, string, fabric, and, paper, goods, can, be, cut, to, size, children, learn, the, basic, use, of, rulers, at, the, elementary, school, level, and, they, are, often, part, of, a, student, s, school, supplies, at, the, high, school, level, rulers, are, often, used, as, straightedges, for, geometric, constructions, in, euclidean, geometry, rulers, are, ubiquitous, in, the, engineering, and, construction, industries, often, in, the, form, of, a, tape, measure, and, are, used, for, making, and, reading, technical, drawings, since, much, technical, work, is, now, done, on, computers, many, software, programs, implement, virtual, rulers, to, help, the, user, estimate, virtual, distances, rulers, have, long, been, made, from, different, materials, and, in, multiple, sizes, historically, they, were, mainly, wooden, but, plastics, have, also, been, used, they, can, be, molded, with, length, markings, instead, of, being, scribed, metal, is, also, used, for, more, durable, rulers, for, use, in, the, workshop, sometimes, a, metal, edge, is, embedded, into, a, wooden, desk, ruler, to, preserve, the, edge, when, used, for, straight, line, cutting, 12, in, or, 30, cm, in, length, is, useful, for, a, ruler, to, be, kept, on, a, desk, to, help, in, drawing, shorter, rulers, are, convenient, for, keeping, in, a, pocket, longer, rulers, e, g, 46, cm, 18, in, are, necessary, in, some, cases, rigid, wooden, or, plastic, yardsticks, 1, yard, long, and, meter, sticks, 1, meter, long, are, also, used, classically, long, measuring, rods, were, used, for, larger, projects, now, superseded, by, the, tape, measure, the, surveyor, s, wheel, or, laser, rangefinders, desk, rulers, are, used, for, three, main, purposes, to, measure, to, aid, in, drawing, straight, lines, and, as, a, straight, guide, for, cutting, and, scoring, with, a, blade, practical, rulers, have, distance, markings, along, their, edges, a, line, gauge, is, a, type, of, ruler, used, in, the, printing, industry, these, may, be, made, from, a, variety, of, materials, typically, metal, or, clear, plastic, units, of, measurement, on, a, basic, line, gauge, usually, include, inches, agate, picas, and, points, more, detailed, line, gauges, may, contain, sample, widths, of, lines, samples, of, common, type, in, several, point, sizes, etc, measuring, instruments, similar, in, function, to, rulers, are, made, portable, by, folding, carpenter, s, folding, rule, or, retracting, into, a, coil, metal, tape, measure, when, not, in, use, when, extended, for, use, they, are, straight, like, a, ruler, the, illustrations, on, this, page, show, a, 2, m, 6, ft, 7, in, carpenter, s, rule, which, folds, down, to, a, length, of, 25, cm, 10, in, to, easily, fit, in, a, pocket, and, a, 5, m, 16, ft, tape, which, retracts, into, a, small, housing, a, flexible, length, measuring, instrument, which, is, not, necessarily, straight, in, use, is, the, tailor, s, fabric, tape, measure, a, length, of, tape, calibrated, in, inches, and, centimeters, it, is, used, to, measure, around, a, solid, body, e, g, for, a, person, s, waist, measurement, as, well, as, for, linear, measurement, e, g, for, the, inside, leg, length, it, is, rolled, up, when, not, in, use, taking, up, little, space, an, online, ruler, software, program, can, be, used, to, measure, pixels, on, a, computer, screen, or, mobile, phone, these, programs, are, also, known, as, screen, rulers, or, online, ruler, it, is, used, to, measure, the, actual, size, of, an, object, in, inches, centimeters, or, millimeters, in, geometry, straight, lines, between, points, may, be, drawn, using, a, straightedge, ruler, without, any, markings, on, it, furthermore, it, is, also, used, to, draw, accurate, graphs, and, tables, a, ruler, and, compass, construction, is, a, construction, that, uses, a, ruler, and, a, compass, it, is, possible, to, bisect, an, angle, into, two, equal, parts, with, a, ruler, and, compass, it, can, be, proven, though, that, it, is, impossible, to, divide, an, angle, into, three, equal, parts, using, only, a, compass, and, straightedge, the, problem, of, angle, trisection, however, if, two, marks, be, allowed, on, the, ruler, the, problem, becomes, solvable, in, the, history, of, measurement, many, distance, units, have, been, used, which, were, based, on, human, body, parts, such, as, the, cubit, hand, and, foot, and, these, units, varied, in, length, by, era, and, location, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, metric, system, came, into, use, and, has, been, adopted, to, varying, degrees, in, almost, all, countries, in, the, world, the, oldest, preserved, measuring, rod, is, a, copper, alloy, bar, that, dates, from, c, 2650, bc, and, was, found, by, the, german, assyriologist, eckhard, unger, while, excavating, at, the, sumerian, city, of, nippur, present, day, iraq, rulers, made, of, ivory, were, in, use, by, the, indus, valley, civilization, period, prior, to, 1500, bc, excavations, at, lothal, 2400, bc, have, yielded, one, such, ruler, calibrated, to, about, 1, 6, millimetres, 1, 16, in, ian, whitelaw, holds, that, the, mohenjo, daro, ruler, is, divided, into, units, corresponding, to, 33, 5, millimetres, 1, 32, in, and, these, are, marked, out, in, decimal, subdivisions, with, amazing, accuracy, to, within, 0, 13, millimetres, 0, 005, in, ancient, bricks, found, throughout, the, region, have, dimensions, that, correspond, to, these, units, anton, ullrich, invented, the, folding, ruler, in, 1851, frank, hunt, later, made, the, flexible, ruler, in, 1902, the, equivalent, of, a, ruler, for, drawing, or, reproducing, a, smooth, curve, where, it, takes, the, form, of, a, rigid, template, is, known, as, a, french, curve, a, flexible, device, that, can, be, bent, to, the, desired, shape, is, known, as, a, flat, spline, or, in, its, more, modern, incarnation, a, flexible, curve, historically, a, flexible, lead, rule, used, by, masons, that, could, be, bent, to, the, curves, of, a, molding, was, known, as, a, lesbian, rule, ludwig, wittgenstein, famously, used, rulers, as, an, example, in, his, discussion, of, language, games, in, the, philosophical, investigations, 1953, he, pointed, out, that, the, standard, meter, bar, in, paris, was, the, criterion, against, which, all, other, rulers, were, determined, to, be, one, meter, long, however, there, was, no, analytical, way, to, demonstrate, that, the, standard, meter, bar, itself, was, one, meter, long, it, could, only, be, asserted, as, one, meter, as, part, of, a, language,
