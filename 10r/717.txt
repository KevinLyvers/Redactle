a, ship, is, a, large, vessel, that, travels, the, world, s, oceans, and, other, navigable, waterways, carrying, cargo, or, passengers, or, in, support, of, specialized, missions, such, as, defense, research, and, fishing, ships, are, generally, distinguished, from, boats, based, on, size, shape, load, capacity, and, purpose, ships, have, supported, exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, and, science, ship, transport, is, responsible, for, the, largest, portion, of, world, commerce, the, word, ship, has, meant, depending, on, the, era, and, the, context, either, just, a, large, vessel, or, specifically, a, ship, rigged, sailing, ship, with, three, or, more, masts, each, of, which, is, square, rigged, as, of, 2016, there, were, more, than, 49, 000, merchant, ships, totaling, almost, 1, 8, billion, deadweight, tons, of, these, 28, were, oil, tankers, 43, were, bulk, carriers, and, 13, were, container, ships, the, earliest, historical, evidence, of, boats, is, found, in, egypt, during, the, 4th, millennium, bce, ships, are, typically, larger, than, boats, but, there, is, no, universally, accepted, distinction, between, the, two, ships, generally, can, remain, at, sea, for, longer, periods, of, time, than, boats, a, legal, definition, of, ship, from, indian, case, law, is, a, vessel, that, carries, goods, by, sea, a, common, notion, is, that, a, ship, can, carry, a, boat, but, not, vice, versa, a, ship, is, likely, to, have, a, full, time, crew, assigned, a, us, navy, rule, of, thumb, is, that, ships, heel, towards, the, outside, of, a, sharp, turn, whereas, boats, heel, towards, the, inside, because, of, the, relative, location, of, the, center, of, mass, versus, the, center, of, buoyancy, american, and, british, 19th, century, maritime, law, distinguished, vessels, from, other, watercraft, ships, and, boats, fall, in, one, legal, category, whereas, open, boats, and, rafts, are, not, considered, vessels, particularly, in, the, age, of, sail, the, word, ship, might, apply, generally, to, a, seagoing, vessel, or, particularly, to, a, full, rigged, sailing, ship, with, three, or, more, masts, all, square, rigged, other, rigs, on, seagoing, vessels, included, brig, barque, and, barquentine, 8, 2, 222, some, large, vessels, are, traditionally, called, boats, notably, submarines, others, include, great, lakes, freighters, riverboats, and, ferryboats, which, may, be, designed, for, operation, on, inland, or, protected, coastal, waters, in, most, maritime, traditions, ships, have, individual, names, and, modern, ships, may, belong, to, a, ship, class, often, named, after, its, first, ship, in, many, documents, the, ship, name, is, introduced, with, a, ship, prefix, being, an, abbreviation, of, the, ship, class, for, example, ms, motor, ship, or, sv, sailing, vessel, making, it, easier, to, distinguish, a, ship, name, from, other, individual, names, in, a, text, ship, along, with, nation, is, an, english, word, that, has, retained, a, female, grammatical, gender, in, some, usages, which, allows, it, sometimes, to, be, referred, to, as, a, she, without, being, of, female, natural, gender, for, most, of, history, transport, by, ship, provided, there, is, a, feasible, route, has, generally, been, cheaper, safer, and, faster, than, making, the, same, journey, on, land, only, the, coming, of, railways, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, and, the, growth, of, commercial, aviation, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, have, changed, this, principle, this, applied, equally, to, sea, crossings, coastal, voyages, and, use, of, rivers, and, lakes, examples, of, the, consequences, of, this, include, the, large, grain, trade, in, the, mediterranean, during, the, classical, period, cities, such, as, rome, were, totally, reliant, on, the, delivery, by, sailing, and, human, powered, oars, ships, of, the, large, amounts, of, grain, needed, it, has, been, estimated, that, it, cost, less, for, a, sailing, ship, of, the, roman, empire, to, carry, grain, the, length, of, the, mediterranean, than, to, move, the, same, amount, 15, miles, by, road, rome, consumed, about, 150, 000, tons, of, egyptian, grain, each, year, over, the, first, three, centuries, ad, 297, ch, 2, 147, until, recently, it, was, generally, the, case, that, a, ship, represented, the, most, advanced, representation, of, the, technology, that, any, society, could, achieve, ch, 1, the, earliest, attestations, of, ships, in, maritime, transport, in, mesopotamia, are, model, ships, which, date, back, to, the, 4th, millennium, bc, in, archaic, texts, in, uruk, sumer, the, ideogram, for, ship, is, attested, but, in, the, inscriptions, of, the, kings, of, lagash, ships, were, first, mentioned, in, connection, to, maritime, trade, and, naval, warfare, at, around, 2500, 2350, bce, austronesian, peoples, originated, in, what, is, now, taiwan, from, here, they, took, part, in, the, austronesian, expansion, their, distinctive, maritime, technology, was, integral, to, this, movement, and, included, catamarans, and, outriggers, it, has, been, deduced, that, they, had, sails, some, time, before, 2000, bce, 144, their, crab, claw, sails, enabled, them, to, sail, for, vast, distances, in, open, ocean, from, taiwan, they, rapidly, colonized, the, islands, of, maritime, southeast, asia, then, sailed, further, onwards, to, micronesia, island, melanesia, polynesia, and, madagascar, eventually, colonizing, a, territory, spanning, half, the, globe, austronesian, sails, were, made, from, woven, leaves, usually, from, pandan, plants, these, were, complemented, by, paddlers, who, usually, positioned, themselves, on, platforms, on, the, outriggers, in, the, larger, boats, austronesian, ships, ranged, in, complexity, from, simple, dugout, canoes, with, outriggers, or, lashed, together, to, large, edge, pegged, plank, built, boats, built, around, a, keel, made, from, a, dugout, canoe, their, designs, were, unique, evolving, from, ancient, rafts, to, the, characteristic, double, hulled, single, outrigger, and, double, outrigger, designs, of, austronesian, ships, early, austronesian, sailors, influenced, the, development, of, sailing, technologies, in, sri, lanka, and, southern, india, through, the, austronesian, maritime, trade, network, of, the, indian, ocean, the, precursor, to, the, spice, trade, route, and, the, maritime, silk, road, which, was, established, at, around, 1500, bc, the, junk, rigs, of, chinese, ships, is, also, believed, to, be, developed, from, tilted, sails, 612, 613, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, people, from, the, indonesian, archipelago, already, made, large, ships, measuring, over, 50, m, long, and, standing, 4, 7, m, out, of, the, water, they, could, carry, 600, 1000, people, and, 250, 1000, ton, cargo, these, ships, were, known, as, kunlun, bo, or, k, unlun, po, lit, ship, of, the, kunlun, people, by, the, chinese, and, kolandiaphonta, by, the, greeks, they, had, 4, 7, masts, and, were, able, to, sail, against, the, wind, due, to, the, usage, of, tanja, sails, these, ships, may, have, reached, as, far, as, ghana, 41, 262, 347, in, the, 11th, century, a, new, type, of, ship, called, djong, or, jong, was, recorded, in, java, and, bali, 222, 230, 267, 82, this, type, of, ship, was, built, using, wooden, dowels, and, treenails, unlike, the, kunlun, bo, which, used, vegetal, fibres, for, lashings, 138, in, china, miniature, models, of, ships, that, feature, steering, oars, have, been, dated, to, the, warring, states, period, c, 475, 221, bc, by, the, han, dynasty, a, well, kept, naval, fleet, was, an, integral, part, of, the, military, sternpost, mounted, rudders, started, to, appear, on, chinese, ship, models, starting, in, the, 1st, century, ad, however, these, early, chinese, ships, were, fluvial, riverine, and, were, not, seaworthy, 20, the, chinese, only, acquired, sea, going, ship, technologies, in, the, 10th, century, ad, song, dynasty, after, contact, with, southeast, asian, k, un, lun, po, trading, ships, leading, to, the, development, of, the, junks, 20, 21, the, earliest, historical, evidence, of, boats, is, found, in, egypt, during, the, 4th, millennium, bce, the, greek, historian, and, geographer, agatharchides, had, documented, ship, faring, among, the, early, egyptians, during, the, prosperous, period, of, the, old, kingdom, between, the, 30th, and, 25th, centuries, bc, the, river, routes, were, kept, in, order, and, egyptian, ships, sailed, the, red, sea, as, far, as, the, myrrh, country, sneferu, s, ancient, cedar, wood, ship, praise, of, the, two, lands, is, the, first, reference, recorded, 2613, bc, to, a, ship, being, referred, to, by, name, the, ancient, egyptians, were, perfectly, at, ease, building, sailboats, a, remarkable, example, of, their, shipbuilding, skills, was, the, khufu, ship, a, vessel, 143, feet, 44, m, in, length, entombed, at, the, foot, of, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, around, 2500, bc, and, found, intact, in, 1954, the, oldest, discovered, sea, faring, hulled, boat, is, the, late, bronze, age, uluburun, shipwreck, off, the, coast, of, turkey, dating, back, to, 1300, bc, by, 1200, b, c, the, phoenicians, were, building, large, merchant, ships, in, world, maritime, history, declares, richard, woodman, they, are, recognized, as, the, first, true, seafarers, founding, the, art, of, pilotage, cabotage, and, navigation, and, the, architects, of, the, first, true, ship, built, of, planks, capable, of, carrying, a, deadweight, cargo, and, being, sailed, and, steered, at, this, time, ships, were, developing, in, asia, in, much, the, same, way, as, europe, japan, used, defensive, naval, techniques, in, the, mongol, invasions, of, japan, in, 1281, it, is, likely, that, the, mongols, of, the, time, took, advantage, of, both, european, and, asian, shipbuilding, techniques, during, the, 15th, century, china, s, ming, dynasty, assembled, one, of, the, largest, and, most, powerful, naval, fleets, in, the, world, for, the, diplomatic, and, power, projection, voyages, of, zheng, he, elsewhere, in, japan, in, the, 15th, century, one, of, the, world, s, first, iron, clads, tekk, sen, literally, meaning, iron, ships, was, also, developed, in, japan, during, the, sengoku, era, from, the, 15th, century, to, 17th, century, the, great, struggle, for, feudal, supremacy, was, fought, in, part, by, coastal, fleets, of, several, hundred, boats, including, the, atakebune, in, korea, in, the, early, 15th, century, during, the, joseon, era, geobukseon, was, developed, the, empire, of, majapahit, used, large, ships, called, jong, built, in, northern, java, for, transporting, troops, overseas, 115, the, jongs, were, transport, ships, which, could, carry, 100, 2000, tons, of, cargo, and, 50, 1000, people, 28, 99, 88, 56, meter, in, length, 60, 62, the, exact, number, of, jong, fielded, by, majapahit, is, unknown, but, the, largest, number, of, jong, deployed, in, an, expedition, is, about, 400, jongs, when, majapahit, attacked, pasai, in, 1350, several, civilizations, became, sea, powers, such, examples, include, the, maritime, republics, of, genoa, and, venice, hanseatic, league, and, the, byzantine, navy, the, vikings, used, their, knarrs, to, explore, north, america, trade, in, the, baltic, sea, and, plunder, many, of, the, coastal, regions, of, western, europe, towards, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, ships, like, the, carrack, began, to, develop, towers, on, the, bow, and, stern, these, towers, decreased, the, vessel, s, stability, and, in, the, 15th, century, the, caravel, designed, by, the, portuguese, based, on, the, arabic, qarib, which, could, sail, closer, to, the, wind, became, more, widely, used, the, towers, were, gradually, replaced, by, the, forecastle, and, sterncastle, as, in, the, carrack, santa, mar, a, of, christopher, columbus, this, increased, freeboard, allowed, another, innovation, the, freeing, port, and, the, artillery, associated, with, it, the, carrack, was, developed, in, portugal, the, crown, of, castile, and, the, crown, of, aragon, then, the, caravel, was, developed, in, portugal, and, the, galleon, was, developed, in, spain, after, columbus, european, exploration, rapidly, accelerated, and, many, new, trade, routes, were, established, in, 1498, by, reaching, india, vasco, da, gama, proved, that, access, to, the, indian, ocean, from, the, atlantic, was, possible, these, explorations, in, the, atlantic, and, indian, oceans, were, soon, followed, by, france, england, and, the, netherlands, who, explored, the, portuguese, and, spanish, trade, routes, into, the, pacific, ocean, reaching, australia, in, 1606, and, new, zealand, in, 1642, after, the, 15th, century, new, crops, that, had, come, from, and, to, the, americas, via, the, european, seafarers, significantly, contributed, to, world, population, growth, parallel, to, the, development, of, warships, ships, in, service, of, marine, fishery, and, trade, also, developed, in, the, period, between, antiquity, and, the, renaissance, maritime, trade, was, driven, by, the, development, of, shipping, companies, with, significant, financial, resources, canal, barges, towed, by, draft, animals, on, an, adjacent, towpath, contended, with, the, railway, up, to, and, past, the, early, days, of, the, industrial, revolution, flat, bottomed, and, flexible, scow, boats, also, became, widely, used, for, transporting, small, cargoes, mercantile, trade, went, hand, in, hand, with, exploration, self, financed, by, the, commercial, benefits, of, exploration, during, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, the, french, navy, began, to, develop, a, new, type, of, vessel, known, as, a, ship, of, the, line, featuring, seventy, four, guns, this, type, of, ship, became, the, backbone, of, all, european, fighting, fleets, these, ships, were, 56, metres, 184, ft, long, and, their, construction, required, 2, 800, oak, trees, and, 40, kilometres, 25, mi, of, rope, they, carried, a, crew, of, about, 800, sailors, and, soldiers, during, the, 19th, century, the, royal, navy, enforced, a, ban, on, the, slave, trade, acted, to, suppress, piracy, and, continued, to, map, the, world, a, clipper, was, a, very, fast, sailing, ship, of, the, 19th, century, the, clipper, routes, fell, into, commercial, disuse, with, the, introduction, of, steam, ships, with, better, fuel, efficiency, and, the, opening, of, the, suez, and, panama, canals, ship, designs, stayed, fairly, unchanged, until, the, late, 19th, century, the, industrial, revolution, new, mechanical, methods, of, propulsion, and, the, ability, to, construct, ships, from, metal, triggered, an, explosion, in, ship, design, factors, including, the, quest, for, more, efficient, ships, the, end, of, long, running, and, wasteful, maritime, conflicts, and, the, increased, financial, capacity, of, industrial, powers, created, an, avalanche, of, more, specialized, boats, and, ships, ships, built, for, entirely, new, functions, such, as, firefighting, rescue, and, research, also, began, to, appear, in, 2019, the, world, s, fleet, included, 51, 684, commercial, vessels, with, gross, tonnage, of, more, than, 1, 000, tons, totaling, 1, 96, billion, tons, such, ships, carried, 11, billion, tons, of, cargo, in, 2018, a, sum, that, grew, by, 2, 7, over, the, previous, year, in, terms, of, tonnage, 29, of, ships, were, tankers, 43, are, bulk, carriers, 13, container, ships, and, 15, were, other, types, in, 2008, there, were, 1, 240, warships, operating, in, the, world, not, counting, small, vessels, such, as, patrol, boats, the, united, states, accounted, for, 3, million, tons, worth, of, these, vessels, russia, 1, 35, million, tons, the, united, kingdom, 504, 660, tons, and, china, 402, 830, tons, the, 20th, century, saw, many, naval, engagements, during, the, two, world, wars, the, cold, war, and, the, rise, to, power, of, naval, forces, of, the, two, blocs, the, world, s, major, powers, have, recently, used, their, naval, power, in, cases, such, as, the, united, kingdom, in, the, falkland, islands, and, the, united, states, in, iraq, the, size, of, the, world, s, fishing, fleet, is, more, difficult, to, estimate, the, largest, of, these, are, counted, as, commercial, vessels, but, the, smallest, are, legion, fishing, vessels, can, be, found, in, most, seaside, villages, in, the, world, as, of, 2004, the, united, nations, food, and, agriculture, organization, estimated, 4, million, fishing, vessels, were, operating, worldwide, the, same, study, estimated, that, the, world, s, 29, million, fishermen, caught, 85, 800, 000, tonnes, 84, 400, 000, long, tons, 94, 600, 000, short, tons, of, fish, and, shellfish, that, year, because, ships, are, constructed, using, the, principles, of, naval, architecture, that, require, same, structural, components, their, classification, is, based, on, their, function, such, as, that, suggested, by, paulet, and, presles, which, requires, modification, of, the, components, the, categories, accepted, in, general, by, naval, architects, are, some, of, these, are, discussed, in, the, following, sections, freshwater, shipping, may, occur, on, lakes, rivers, and, canals, ships, designed, for, those, body, of, waters, may, be, specially, adapted, to, the, widths, and, depths, of, specific, waterways, examples, of, freshwater, waterways, that, are, navigable, in, part, by, large, vessels, include, the, danube, mississippi, rhine, yangtze, and, amazon, rivers, and, the, great, lakes, lake, freighters, also, called, lakers, are, cargo, vessels, that, ply, the, great, lakes, the, most, well, known, is, ss, edmund, fitzgerald, the, latest, major, vessel, to, be, wrecked, on, the, lakes, these, vessels, are, traditionally, called, boats, not, ships, visiting, ocean, going, vessels, are, called, salties, because, of, their, additional, beam, very, large, salties, are, never, seen, inland, of, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, because, the, smallest, of, the, soo, locks, is, larger, than, any, seaway, lock, salties, that, can, pass, through, the, seaway, may, travel, anywhere, in, the, great, lakes, because, of, their, deeper, draft, salties, may, accept, partial, loads, on, the, great, lakes, topping, off, when, they, have, exited, the, seaway, similarly, the, largest, lakers, are, confined, to, the, upper, lakes, superior, michigan, huron, erie, because, they, are, too, large, to, use, the, seaway, locks, beginning, at, the, welland, canal, that, bypasses, the, niagara, river, since, the, freshwater, lakes, are, less, corrosive, to, ships, than, the, salt, water, of, the, oceans, lakers, tend, to, last, much, longer, than, ocean, freighters, lakers, older, than, 50, years, are, not, unusual, and, as, of, 2005, all, were, over, 20, years, of, age, ss, st, marys, challenger, built, in, 1906, as, william, p, snyder, was, the, oldest, laker, still, working, on, the, lakes, until, its, conversion, into, a, barge, starting, in, 2013, similarly, e, m, ford, built, in, 1898, as, presque, isle, was, sailing, the, lakes, 98, years, later, in, 1996, as, of, 2007, e, m, ford, was, still, afloat, as, a, stationary, transfer, vessel, at, a, riverside, cement, silo, in, saginaw, michigan, merchant, ships, are, ships, used, for, commercial, purposes, and, can, be, divided, into, four, broad, categories, fishing, vessels, cargo, ships, passenger, ships, and, special, purpose, ships, the, unctad, review, of, maritime, transport, categorizes, ships, as, oil, tankers, bulk, and, combination, carriers, general, cargo, ships, container, ships, and, other, ships, which, includes, liquefied, petroleum, gas, carriers, liquefied, natural, gas, carriers, parcel, chemical, tankers, specialized, tankers, reefers, offshore, supply, tugs, dredgers, cruise, ferries, other, non, cargo, general, cargo, ships, include, multi, purpose, and, project, vessels, and, roll, on, roll, off, cargo, modern, commercial, vessels, are, typically, powered, by, a, single, propeller, driven, by, a, diesel, or, less, usually, gas, turbine, engine, but, until, the, mid, 19th, century, they, were, predominantly, square, sail, rigged, the, fastest, vessels, may, use, pump, jet, engines, most, commercial, vessels, have, full, hull, forms, to, maximize, cargo, capacity, hulls, are, usually, made, of, steel, although, aluminum, can, be, used, on, faster, craft, and, fiberglass, on, the, smallest, service, vessels, commercial, vessels, generally, have, a, crew, headed, by, a, sea, captain, with, deck, officers, and, engine, officers, on, larger, vessels, special, purpose, vessels, often, have, specialized, crew, if, necessary, for, example, scientists, aboard, research, vessels, fishing, boats, are, generally, small, often, little, more, than, 30, meters, 98, ft, but, up, to, 100, metres, 330, ft, for, a, large, tuna, or, whaling, ship, aboard, a, fish, processing, vessel, the, catch, can, be, made, ready, for, market, and, sold, more, quickly, once, the, ship, makes, port, special, purpose, vessels, have, special, gear, for, example, trawlers, have, winches, and, arms, stern, trawlers, have, a, rear, ramp, and, tuna, seiners, have, skiffs, in, 2004, 85, 800, 000, tonnes, 84, 400, 000, long, tons, 94, 600, 000, short, tons, of, fish, were, caught, in, the, marine, capture, fishery, anchoveta, represented, the, largest, single, catch, at, 10, 700, 000, tonnes, 10, 500, 000, long, tons, 11, 800, 000, short, tons, that, year, the, top, ten, marine, capture, species, also, included, alaska, pollock, blue, whiting, skipjack, tuna, atlantic, herring, chub, mackerel, japanese, anchovy, chilean, jack, mackerel, largehead, hairtail, and, yellowfin, tuna, other, species, including, salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid, and, crab, are, also, commercially, fished, modern, commercial, fishermen, use, many, methods, one, is, fishing, by, nets, such, as, purse, seine, beach, seine, lift, nets, gillnets, or, entangling, nets, another, is, trawling, including, bottom, trawl, hooks, and, lines, are, used, in, methods, like, long, line, fishing, and, hand, line, fishing, another, method, is, the, use, of, fishing, trap, cargo, ships, transport, dry, and, liquid, cargo, dry, cargo, can, be, transported, in, bulk, by, bulk, carriers, packed, directly, onto, a, general, cargo, ship, in, break, bulk, packed, in, intermodal, containers, as, aboard, a, container, ship, or, driven, aboard, as, in, roll, on, roll, off, ships, liquid, cargo, is, generally, carried, in, bulk, aboard, tankers, such, as, oil, tankers, which, may, include, both, crude, and, finished, products, of, oil, chemical, tankers, which, may, also, carry, vegetable, oils, other, than, chemicals, and, gas, carriers, although, smaller, shipments, may, be, carried, on, container, ships, in, tank, containers, passenger, ships, range, in, size, from, small, river, ferries, to, very, large, cruise, ships, this, type, of, vessel, includes, ferries, which, move, passengers, and, vehicles, on, short, trips, ocean, liners, which, carry, passengers, from, one, place, to, another, and, cruise, ships, which, carry, passengers, on, voyages, undertaken, for, pleasure, visiting, several, places, and, with, leisure, activities, on, board, often, returning, them, to, the, port, of, embarkation, riverboats, and, inland, ferries, are, specially, designed, to, carry, passengers, cargo, or, both, in, the, challenging, river, environment, rivers, present, special, hazards, to, vessels, they, usually, have, varying, water, flows, that, alternately, lead, to, high, speed, water, flows, or, protruding, rock, hazards, changing, siltation, patterns, may, cause, the, sudden, appearance, of, shoal, waters, and, often, floating, or, sunken, logs, and, trees, called, snags, can, endanger, the, hulls, and, propulsion, of, riverboats, riverboats, are, generally, of, shallow, draft, being, broad, of, beam, and, rather, square, in, plan, with, a, low, freeboard, and, high, topsides, riverboats, can, survive, with, this, type, of, configuration, as, they, do, not, have, to, withstand, the, high, winds, or, large, waves, that, are, seen, on, large, lakes, seas, or, oceans, fishing, vessels, are, a, subset, of, commercial, vessels, but, generally, small, in, size, and, often, subject, to, different, regulations, and, classification, they, can, be, categorized, by, several, criteria, architecture, the, type, of, fish, they, catch, the, fishing, method, used, geographical, origin, and, technical, features, such, as, rigging, as, of, 2004, the, world, s, fishing, fleet, consisted, of, some, 4, million, vessels, of, these, 1, 3, million, were, decked, vessels, with, enclosed, areas, and, the, rest, were, open, vessels, most, decked, vessels, were, mechanized, but, two, thirds, of, the, open, vessels, were, traditional, craft, propelled, by, sails, and, oars, more, than, 60, of, all, existing, large, fishing, vessels, were, built, in, japan, peru, the, russian, federation, spain, or, the, united, states, of, america, a, weather, ship, was, a, ship, stationed, in, the, ocean, as, a, platform, for, surface, and, upper, air, meteorological, observations, for, use, in, marine, weather, forecasting, surface, weather, observations, were, taken, hourly, and, four, radiosonde, releases, occurred, daily, it, was, also, meant, to, aid, in, search, and, rescue, operations, and, to, support, transatlantic, flights, proposed, as, early, as, 1927, by, the, aviation, community, the, establishment, of, weather, ships, proved, to, be, so, useful, during, world, war, ii, that, the, international, civil, aviation, organization, icao, established, a, global, network, of, weather, ships, in, 1948, with, 13, to, be, supplied, by, the, united, states, this, number, was, eventually, negotiated, down, to, nine, the, weather, ship, crews, were, normally, at, sea, for, three, weeks, at, a, time, returning, to, port, for, 10, day, stretches, weather, ship, observations, proved, to, be, helpful, in, wind, and, wave, studies, as, they, did, not, avoid, weather, systems, like, other, ships, tended, to, for, safety, reasons, they, were, also, helpful, in, monitoring, storms, at, sea, such, as, tropical, cyclones, the, removal, of, a, weather, ship, became, a, negative, factor, in, forecasts, leading, up, to, the, great, storm, of, 1987, beginning, in, the, 1970s, their, role, became, largely, superseded, by, weather, buoys, due, to, the, ships, significant, cost, the, agreement, of, the, use, of, weather, ships, by, the, international, community, ended, in, 1990, the, last, weather, ship, was, polarfront, known, as, weather, station, m, mike, which, was, put, out, of, operation, on, 1, january, 2010, weather, observations, from, ships, continue, from, a, fleet, of, voluntary, merchant, vessels, in, routine, commercial, operation, naval, ships, are, diverse, in, types, of, vessel, they, include, surface, warships, submarines, and, auxiliary, ships, modern, warships, are, generally, divided, into, seven, main, categories, aircraft, carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines, and, amphibious, warfare, ships, the, distinctions, among, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and, corvettes, are, not, codified, the, same, vessel, may, be, described, differently, in, different, navies, battleships, were, used, during, the, second, world, war, and, occasionally, since, then, the, last, battleships, were, removed, from, the, u, s, naval, vessel, register, in, march, 2006, but, were, made, obsolete, by, the, use, of, carrier, borne, aircraft, and, guided, missiles, most, military, submarines, are, either, attack, submarines, or, ballistic, missile, submarines, until, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, primary, role, of, the, diesel, electric, submarine, was, anti, ship, warfare, inserting, and, removing, covert, agents, and, military, forces, and, intelligence, gathering, with, the, development, of, the, homing, torpedo, better, sonar, systems, and, nuclear, propulsion, submarines, also, became, able, to, effectively, hunt, each, other, the, development, of, submarine, launched, nuclear, and, cruise, missiles, gave, submarines, a, substantial, and, long, ranged, ability, to, attack, both, land, and, sea, targets, with, a, variety, of, weapons, ranging, from, cluster, munitions, to, nuclear, weapons, most, navies, also, include, many, types, of, support, and, auxiliary, vessel, such, as, minesweepers, patrol, boats, offshore, patrol, vessels, replenishment, ships, and, hospital, ships, which, are, designated, medical, treatment, facilities, fast, combat, vessels, such, as, cruisers, and, destroyers, usually, have, fine, hulls, to, maximize, speed, and, maneuverability, they, also, usually, have, advanced, marine, electronics, and, communication, systems, as, well, as, weapons, some, components, exist, in, vessels, of, any, size, and, purpose, every, vessel, has, a, hull, of, sorts, every, vessel, has, some, sort, of, propulsion, whether, it, s, a, pole, an, ox, or, a, nuclear, reactor, most, vessels, have, some, sort, of, steering, system, other, characteristics, are, common, but, not, as, universal, such, as, compartments, holds, a, superstructure, and, equipment, such, as, anchors, and, winches, for, a, ship, to, float, its, weight, must, be, less, than, that, of, the, water, displaced, by, the, ship, s, hull, there, are, many, types, of, hulls, from, logs, lashed, together, to, form, a, raft, to, the, advanced, hulls, of, america, s, cup, sailboats, a, vessel, may, have, a, single, hull, called, a, monohull, design, two, in, the, case, of, catamarans, or, three, in, the, case, of, trimarans, vessels, with, more, than, three, hulls, are, rare, but, some, experiments, have, been, conducted, with, designs, such, as, pentamarans, multiple, hulls, are, generally, parallel, to, each, other, and, connected, by, rigid, arms, hulls, have, several, elements, the, bow, is, the, foremost, part, of, the, hull, many, ships, feature, a, bulbous, bow, the, keel, is, at, the, very, bottom, of, the, hull, extending, the, entire, length, of, the, ship, the, rear, part, of, the, hull, is, known, as, the, stern, and, many, hulls, have, a, flat, back, known, as, a, transom, common, hull, appendages, include, propellers, for, propulsion, rudders, for, steering, and, stabilizers, to, quell, a, ship, s, rolling, motion, other, hull, features, can, be, related, to, the, vessel, s, work, such, as, fishing, gear, and, sonar, domes, hulls, are, subject, to, various, hydrostatic, and, hydrodynamic, constraints, the, key, hydrostatic, constraint, is, that, it, must, be, able, to, support, the, entire, weight, of, the, boat, and, maintain, stability, even, with, often, unevenly, distributed, weight, hydrodynamic, constraints, include, the, ability, to, withstand, shock, waves, weather, collisions, and, groundings, older, ships, and, pleasure, craft, often, have, or, had, wooden, hulls, steel, is, used, for, most, commercial, vessels, aluminium, is, frequently, used, for, fast, vessels, and, composite, materials, are, often, found, in, sailboats, and, pleasure, craft, some, ships, have, been, made, with, concrete, hulls, propulsion, systems, for, ships, fall, into, three, categories, human, propulsion, sailing, and, mechanical, propulsion, human, propulsion, includes, rowing, which, was, used, even, on, large, galleys, propulsion, by, sail, generally, consists, of, a, sail, hoisted, on, an, erect, mast, supported, by, stays, and, spars, and, controlled, by, ropes, sail, systems, were, the, dominant, form, of, propulsion, until, the, 19th, century, they, are, now, generally, used, for, recreation, and, competition, although, experimental, sail, systems, such, as, the, turbosails, rotorsails, and, wingsails, have, been, used, on, larger, modern, vessels, for, fuel, savings, mechanical, propulsion, systems, generally, consist, of, a, motor, or, engine, turning, a, propeller, or, less, frequently, an, impeller, or, wave, propulsion, fins, steam, engines, were, first, used, for, this, purpose, but, have, mostly, been, replaced, by, two, stroke, or, four, stroke, diesel, engines, outboard, motors, and, gas, turbine, engines, on, faster, ships, nuclear, reactors, producing, steam, are, used, to, propel, warships, and, icebreakers, and, there, have, been, attempts, to, use, them, to, power, commercial, vessels, see, ns, savannah, in, addition, to, traditional, fixed, and, controllable, pitch, propellers, there, are, many, specialized, variations, such, as, contra, rotating, and, nozzle, style, propellers, most, vessels, have, a, single, propeller, but, some, large, vessels, may, have, up, to, four, propellers, supplemented, with, transverse, thrusters, for, maneuvring, at, ports, the, propeller, is, connected, to, the, main, engine, via, a, propeller, shaft, and, in, case, of, medium, and, high, speed, engines, a, reduction, gearbox, some, modern, vessels, have, a, diesel, electric, powertrain, in, which, the, propeller, is, turned, by, an, electric, motor, powered, by, the, ship, s, generators, as, environmental, sustainability, becomes, a, paramount, concern, the, maritime, industry, is, exploring, cleaner, propulsion, technologies, alternatives, like, lpg, liquefied, petroleum, gas, ammonia, and, hydrogen, are, emerging, as, viable, options, lpg, is, already, utilized, as, fuel, for, long, distance, shipping, offering, a, cleaner, option, with, a, lower, carbon, footprint, meanwhile, hydrogen, and, ammonia, technologies, are, in, development, stages, for, long, haul, applications, promising, even, more, significant, reductions, in, emissions, and, a, step, closer, to, achieving, carbon, neutral, shipping, for, ships, with, independent, propulsion, systems, for, each, side, such, as, manual, oars, or, some, paddles, steering, systems, may, not, be, necessary, in, most, designs, such, as, boats, propelled, by, engines, or, sails, a, steering, system, becomes, necessary, the, most, common, is, a, rudder, a, submerged, plane, located, at, the, rear, of, the, hull, rudders, are, rotated, to, generate, a, lateral, force, which, turns, the, boat, rudders, can, be, rotated, by, a, tiller, manual, wheels, or, electro, hydraulic, systems, autopilot, systems, combine, mechanical, rudders, with, navigation, systems, ducted, propellers, are, sometimes, used, for, steering, some, propulsion, systems, are, inherently, steering, systems, examples, include, the, outboard, motor, the, bow, thruster, and, the, z, drive, larger, boats, and, ships, generally, have, multiple, decks, and, compartments, separate, berthings, and, heads, are, found, on, sailboats, over, about, 25, feet, 7, 6, m, fishing, boats, and, cargo, ships, typically, have, one, or, more, cargo, holds, most, larger, vessels, have, an, engine, room, a, galley, and, various, compartments, for, work, tanks, are, used, to, store, fuel, engine, oil, and, fresh, water, ballast, tanks, are, equipped, to, change, a, ship, s, trim, and, modify, its, stability, superstructures, are, found, above, the, main, deck, on, sailboats, these, are, usually, very, low, on, modern, cargo, ships, they, are, almost, always, located, near, the, ship, s, stern, on, passenger, ships, and, warships, the, superstructure, generally, extends, far, forward, shipboard, equipment, varies, from, ship, to, ship, depending, on, such, factors, as, the, ship, s, era, design, area, of, operation, and, purpose, some, types, of, equipment, that, are, widely, found, include, ships, float, in, the, water, at, a, level, where, mass, of, the, displaced, water, equals, the, mass, of, the, vessel, so, that, the, downwards, force, of, gravity, equals, the, upward, force, of, buoyancy, as, a, vessel, is, lowered, into, the, water, its, weight, remains, constant, but, the, corresponding, weight, of, water, displaced, by, its, hull, increases, if, the, vessel, s, mass, is, evenly, distributed, throughout, it, floats, evenly, along, its, length, and, across, its, beam, width, a, vessel, s, stability, is, considered, in, both, this, hydrostatic, sense, as, well, as, a, hydrodynamic, sense, when, subjected, to, movement, rolling, and, pitching, and, the, action, of, waves, and, wind, stability, problems, can, lead, to, excessive, pitching, and, rolling, and, eventually, capsizing, and, sinking, the, advance, of, a, vessel, through, water, is, resisted, by, the, water, this, resistance, can, be, broken, down, into, several, components, the, main, ones, being, the, friction, of, the, water, on, the, hull, and, wave, making, resistance, to, reduce, resistance, and, therefore, increase, the, speed, for, a, given, power, it, is, necessary, to, reduce, the, wetted, surface, and, use, submerged, hull, shapes, that, produce, low, amplitude, waves, to, do, so, high, speed, vessels, are, often, more, slender, with, fewer, or, smaller, appendages, the, friction, of, the, water, is, also, reduced, by, regular, maintenance, of, the, hull, to, remove, the, sea, creatures, and, algae, that, accumulate, there, antifouling, paint, is, commonly, used, to, assist, in, this, advanced, designs, such, as, the, bulbous, bow, assist, in, decreasing, wave, resistance, a, simple, way, of, considering, wave, making, resistance, is, to, look, at, the, hull, in, relation, to, its, wake, at, speeds, lower, than, the, wave, propagation, speed, the, wave, rapidly, dissipates, to, the, sides, as, the, hull, approaches, the, wave, propagation, speed, however, the, wake, at, the, bow, begins, to, build, up, faster, than, it, can, dissipate, and, so, it, grows, in, amplitude, since, the, water, is, not, able, to, get, out, of, the, way, of, the, hull, fast, enough, the, hull, in, essence, has, to, climb, over, or, push, through, the, bow, wave, this, results, in, an, exponential, increase, in, resistance, with, increasing, speed, this, hull, speed, is, found, by, the, formula, or, in, metric, units, where, l, is, the, length, of, the, waterline, in, feet, or, meters, when, the, vessel, exceeds, a, speed, length, ratio, of, 0, 94, it, starts, to, outrun, most, of, its, bow, wave, and, the, hull, actually, settles, slightly, in, the, water, as, it, is, now, only, supported, by, two, wave, peaks, as, the, vessel, exceeds, a, speed, length, ratio, of, 1, 34, the, hull, speed, the, wavelength, is, now, longer, than, the, hull, and, the, stern, is, no, longer, supported, by, the, wake, causing, the, stern, to, squat, and, the, bow, rise, the, hull, is, now, starting, to, climb, its, own, bow, wave, and, resistance, begins, to, increase, at, a, very, high, rate, while, it, is, possible, to, drive, a, displacement, hull, faster, than, a, speed, length, ratio, of, 1, 34, it, is, prohibitively, expensive, to, do, so, most, large, vessels, operate, at, speed, length, ratios, well, below, that, level, at, speed, length, ratios, of, under, 1, 0, for, large, projects, with, adequate, funding, hydrodynamic, resistance, can, be, tested, experimentally, in, a, hull, testing, pool, or, using, tools, of, computational, fluid, dynamics, vessels, are, also, subject, to, ocean, surface, waves, and, sea, swell, as, well, as, effects, of, wind, and, weather, these, movements, can, be, stressful, for, passengers, and, equipment, and, must, be, controlled, if, possible, the, rolling, movement, can, be, controlled, to, an, extent, by, ballasting, or, by, devices, such, as, fin, stabilizers, pitching, movement, is, more, difficult, to, limit, and, can, be, dangerous, if, the, bow, submerges, in, the, waves, a, phenomenon, called, pounding, sometimes, ships, must, change, course, or, speed, to, stop, violent, rolling, or, pitching, a, ship, will, pass, through, several, stages, during, its, career, the, first, is, usually, an, initial, contract, to, build, the, ship, the, details, of, which, can, vary, widely, based, on, relationships, between, the, shipowners, operators, designers, and, the, shipyard, then, the, design, phase, carried, out, by, a, naval, architect, then, the, ship, is, constructed, in, a, shipyard, after, construction, the, vessel, is, launched, and, goes, into, service, ships, end, their, careers, in, a, number, of, ways, ranging, from, shipwrecks, to, service, as, a, museum, ship, to, the, scrapyard, a, vessel, s, design, starts, with, a, specification, which, a, naval, architect, uses, to, create, a, project, outline, assess, required, dimensions, and, create, a, basic, layout, of, spaces, and, a, rough, displacement, after, this, initial, rough, draft, the, architect, can, create, an, initial, hull, design, a, general, profile, and, an, initial, overview, of, the, ship, s, propulsion, at, this, stage, the, designer, can, iterate, on, the, ship, s, design, adding, detail, and, refining, the, design, at, each, stage, the, designer, will, typically, produce, an, overall, plan, a, general, specification, describing, the, peculiarities, of, the, vessel, and, construction, blueprints, to, be, used, at, the, building, site, designs, for, larger, or, more, complex, vessels, may, also, include, sail, plans, electrical, schematics, and, plumbing, and, ventilation, plans, as, environmental, laws, are, becoming, more, strict, ship, designers, need, to, create, their, design, in, such, a, way, that, the, ship, when, it, nears, its, end, of, term, can, be, disassembled, or, disposed, easily, and, that, waste, is, reduced, to, a, minimum, ship, construction, takes, place, in, a, shipyard, and, can, last, from, a, few, months, for, a, unit, produced, in, series, to, several, years, to, reconstruct, a, wooden, boat, like, the, frigate, hermione, to, more, than, 10, years, for, an, aircraft, carrier, during, world, war, ii, the, need, for, cargo, ships, was, so, urgent, that, construction, time, for, liberty, ships, went, from, initially, eight, months, or, longer, down, to, weeks, or, even, days, builders, employed, production, line, and, prefabrication, techniques, such, as, those, used, in, shipyards, today, hull, materials, and, vessel, size, play, a, large, part, in, determining, the, method, of, construction, the, hull, of, a, mass, produced, fiberglass, sailboat, is, constructed, from, a, mold, while, the, steel, hull, of, a, cargo, ship, is, made, from, large, sections, welded, together, as, they, are, built, generally, construction, starts, with, the, hull, and, on, vessels, over, about, 30, meters, 98, ft, by, the, laying, of, the, keel, this, is, done, in, a, drydock, or, on, land, once, the, hull, is, assembled, and, painted, it, is, launched, the, last, stages, such, as, raising, the, superstructure, and, adding, equipment, and, accommodation, can, be, done, after, the, vessel, is, afloat, once, completed, the, vessel, is, delivered, to, the, customer, ship, launching, is, often, a, ceremony, of, some, significance, and, is, usually, when, the, vessel, is, formally, named, a, typical, small, rowboat, can, cost, under, us, 100, 1, 000, for, a, small, speedboat, tens, of, thousands, of, dollars, for, a, cruising, sailboat, and, about, 2, 000, 000, for, a, vend, e, globe, class, sailboat, a, 25, meters, 82, ft, trawler, may, cost, 2, 5, million, and, a, 1, 000, person, capacity, high, speed, passenger, ferry, can, cost, in, the, neighborhood, of, 50, million, a, ship, s, cost, partly, depends, on, its, complexity, a, small, general, cargo, ship, will, cost, 20, million, a, panamax, sized, bulk, carrier, around, 35, million, a, supertanker, around, 105, million, and, a, large, lng, carrier, nearly, 200, million, the, most, expensive, ships, generally, are, so, because, of, the, cost, of, embedded, electronics, a, seawolf, class, submarine, costs, around, 2, billion, and, an, aircraft, carrier, goes, for, about, 3, 5, billion, ships, undergo, nearly, constant, maintenance, during, their, career, whether, they, be, underway, pierside, or, in, some, cases, in, periods, of, reduced, operating, status, between, charters, or, shipping, seasons, most, ships, however, require, trips, to, special, facilities, such, as, a, drydock, at, regular, intervals, tasks, often, done, at, drydock, include, removing, biological, growths, on, the, hull, sandblasting, and, repainting, the, hull, and, replacing, sacrificial, anodes, used, to, protect, submerged, equipment, from, corrosion, major, repairs, to, the, propulsion, and, steering, systems, as, well, as, major, electrical, systems, are, also, often, performed, at, dry, dock, some, vessels, that, sustain, major, damage, at, sea, may, be, repaired, at, a, facility, equipped, for, major, repairs, such, as, a, shipyard, ships, may, also, be, converted, for, a, new, purpose, oil, tankers, are, often, converted, into, floating, production, storage, and, offloading, units, most, ocean, going, cargo, ships, have, a, life, expectancy, of, between, 20, and, 30, years, a, sailboat, made, of, plywood, or, fiberglass, can, last, between, 30, and, 40, years, solid, wooden, ships, can, last, much, longer, but, require, regular, maintenance, carefully, maintained, steel, hulled, yachts, can, have, a, lifespan, of, over, 100, years, as, ships, age, forces, such, as, corrosion, osmosis, and, rotting, compromise, hull, strength, and, a, vessel, becomes, too, dangerous, to, sail, at, this, point, it, can, be, scuttled, at, sea, or, scrapped, by, shipbreakers, ships, can, also, be, used, as, museum, ships, or, expended, to, construct, breakwaters, or, artificial, reefs, many, ships, do, not, make, it, to, the, scrapyard, and, are, lost, in, fires, collisions, grounding, or, sinking, at, sea, the, allies, lost, some, 5, 150, ships, during, world, war, ii, one, can, measure, ships, in, terms, of, length, overall, length, between, perpendiculars, length, of, the, ship, at, the, waterline, beam, breadth, depth, distance, between, the, crown, of, the, weather, deck, and, the, top, of, the, keelson, draft, distance, between, the, highest, waterline, and, the, bottom, of, the, ship, and, tonnage, a, number, of, different, tonnage, definitions, exist, and, are, used, when, describing, merchant, ships, for, the, purpose, of, tolls, taxation, etc, in, britain, until, samuel, plimsoll, s, merchant, shipping, act, of, 1876, ship, owners, could, load, their, vessels, until, their, decks, were, almost, awash, resulting, in, a, dangerously, unstable, condition, anyone, who, signed, on, to, such, a, ship, for, a, voyage, and, upon, realizing, the, danger, chose, to, leave, the, ship, could, end, up, in, jail, plimsoll, a, member, of, parliament, realised, the, problem, and, engaged, some, engineers, to, derive, a, fairly, simple, formula, to, determine, the, position, of, a, line, on, the, side, of, any, specific, ship, s, hull, which, when, it, reached, the, surface, of, the, water, during, loading, of, cargo, meant, the, ship, had, reached, its, maximum, safe, loading, level, to, this, day, that, mark, called, the, plimsoll, mark, freeboard, mark, or, load, line, mark, exists, on, ships, sides, and, consists, of, a, circle, with, a, horizontal, line, through, the, centre, on, the, great, lakes, of, north, america, the, circle, is, replaced, with, a, diamond, because, different, types, of, water, summer, fresh, tropical, fresh, winter, north, atlantic, have, different, densities, subsequent, regulations, required, painting, a, group, of, lines, forward, of, the, plimsoll, mark, to, indicate, the, safe, depth, or, freeboard, above, the, surface, to, which, a, specific, ship, could, load, in, water, of, various, densities, hence, the, ladder, of, lines, seen, forward, of, the, plimsoll, mark, to, this, day, these, are, called, the, load, lines, in, the, marine, industry, ship, pollution, is, the, pollution, of, air, and, water, by, shipping, it, is, a, problem, that, has, been, accelerating, as, trade, has, become, increasingly, globalized, posing, an, increasing, threat, to, the, world, s, oceans, and, waterways, as, globalization, continues, it, is, expected, that, shipping, traffic, to, and, from, the, united, states, is, projected, to, double, by, 2020, because, of, increased, traffic, in, ocean, ports, pollution, from, ships, also, directly, affects, coastal, areas, the, pollution, produced, affects, biodiversity, climate, food, and, human, health, however, the, degree, to, which, humans, are, polluting, and, how, it, affects, the, world, is, highly, debated, and, has, been, a, hot, international, topic, for, the, past, 30, years, oil, spills, have, devastating, effects, on, the, environment, crude, oil, contains, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, which, are, very, difficult, to, clean, up, and, last, for, years, in, the, sediment, and, marine, environment, marine, species, constantly, exposed, to, pahs, can, exhibit, developmental, problems, susceptibility, to, disease, and, abnormal, reproductive, cycles, by, the, sheer, amount, of, oil, carried, modern, oil, tankers, must, be, considered, something, of, a, threat, to, the, environment, an, oil, tanker, can, carry, 2, million, barrels, 318, 000, m, 3, of, crude, oil, or, 84, 000, 000, us, gallons, 69, 940, 000, imp, gal, 318, 000, 000, l, this, is, more, than, six, times, the, amount, spilled, in, the, widely, known, exxon, valdez, incident, in, this, spill, the, ship, ran, aground, and, dumped, 10, 800, 000, us, gallons, 8, 993, 000, imp, gal, 40, 880, 000, l, of, oil, into, the, ocean, in, march, 1989, despite, efforts, of, scientists, managers, and, volunteers, over, 400, 000, seabirds, about, 1, 000, sea, otters, and, immense, numbers, of, fish, were, killed, the, international, tanker, owners, pollution, federation, has, researched, 9, 351, accidental, spills, since, 1974, according, to, this, study, most, spills, result, from, routine, operations, such, as, loading, cargo, discharging, cargo, and, taking, on, fuel, oil, 91, of, the, operational, oil, spills, were, small, resulting, in, less, than, 7, tons, per, spill, spills, resulting, from, accidents, like, collisions, groundings, hull, failures, and, explosions, are, much, larger, with, 84, of, these, involving, losses, of, over, 700, tons, following, the, exxon, valdez, spill, the, united, states, passed, the, oil, pollution, act, of, 1990, opa, 90, which, included, a, stipulation, that, all, tankers, entering, its, waters, be, double, hulled, by, 2015, following, the, sinkings, of, erika, 1999, and, prestige, 2002, the, european, union, passed, its, own, stringent, anti, pollution, packages, known, as, erika, i, ii, and, iii, which, require, all, tankers, entering, its, waters, to, be, double, hulled, by, 2010, the, erika, packages, are, controversial, because, they, introduced, the, new, legal, concept, of, serious, negligence, when, a, large, vessel, such, as, a, container, ship, or, an, oil, tanker, unloads, cargo, seawater, is, pumped, into, other, compartments, in, the, hull, to, help, stabilize, and, balance, the, ship, during, loading, this, ballast, water, is, pumped, out, from, these, compartments, one, of, the, problems, with, ballast, water, transfer, is, the, transport, of, harmful, organisms, meinesz, believes, that, one, of, the, worst, cases, of, a, single, invasive, species, causing, harm, to, an, ecosystem, can, be, attributed, to, a, seemingly, harmless, planktonic, organism, mnemiopsis, leidyi, a, species, of, comb, jelly, that, inhabits, estuaries, from, the, united, states, to, the, vald, s, peninsula, in, argentina, along, the, atlantic, coast, has, caused, notable, damage, in, the, black, sea, it, was, first, introduced, in, 1982, and, thought, to, have, been, transported, to, the, black, sea, in, a, ship, s, ballast, water, the, population, of, the, comb, jelly, shot, up, exponentially, and, by, 1988, it, was, wreaking, havoc, upon, the, local, fishing, industry, the, anchovy, catch, fell, from, 204, 000, tonnes, 225, 000, short, tons, 201, 000, long, tons, in, 1984, to, 200, tonnes, 220, short, tons, 197, long, tons, in,

tonnes, 4, 410, short, tons, 3, 940, long, tons, in, 1984, to, zero, in, 1993, now, that, the, comb, jellies, have, exhausted, the, zooplankton, including, fish, larvae, their, numbers, have, fallen, dramatically, yet, they, continue, to, maintain, a, stranglehold, on, the, ecosystem, recently, the, comb, jellies, have, been, discovered, in, the, caspian, sea, invasive, species, can, take, over, once, occupied, areas, facilitate, the, spread, of, new, diseases, introduce, new, genetic, material, alter, landscapes, and, jeopardize, the, ability, of, native, species, to, obtain, food, on, land, and, in, the, sea, invasive, species, are, responsible, for, about, 137, billion, dollars, in, lost, revenue, and, management, costs, in, the, u, s, each, year, ballast, and, bilge, discharge, from, ships, can, also, spread, human, pathogens, and, other, harmful, diseases, and, toxins, potentially, causing, health, issues, for, humans, and, marine, life, alike, discharges, into, coastal, waters, along, with, other, sources, of, marine, pollution, have, the, potential, to, be, toxic, to, marine, plants, animals, and, microorganisms, causing, alterations, such, as, changes, in, growth, disruption, of, hormone, cycles, birth, defects, suppression, of, the, immune, system, and, disorders, resulting, in, cancer, tumors, and, genetic, abnormalities, or, even, death, exhaust, emissions, from, ships, are, considered, to, be, a, significant, source, of, air, pollution, seagoing, vessels, are, responsible, for, an, estimated, 14, percent, of, emissions, of, nitrogen, from, fossil, fuels, and, 16, percent, of, the, emissions, of, sulfur, from, petroleum, uses, into, the, atmosphere, in, europe, ships, make, up, a, large, percentage, of, the, sulfur, introduced, to, the, air, as, much, sulfur, as, all, the, cars, lorries, and, factories, in, europe, put, together, by, 2010, up, to, 40, of, air, pollution, over, land, could, come, from, ships, sulfur, in, the, air, creates, acid, rain, which, damages, crops, and, buildings, when, inhaled, sulfur, is, known, to, cause, respiratory, problems, and, increase, the, risk, of, a, heart, attack, ship, breaking, or, ship, demolition, is, a, type, of, ship, disposal, involving, the, breaking, up, of, ships, for, scrap, recycling, with, the, hulls, being, discarded, in, ship, graveyards, most, ships, have, a, lifespan, of, a, few, decades, before, there, is, so, much, wear, that, refitting, and, repair, becomes, uneconomical, ship, breaking, allows, materials, from, the, ship, especially, steel, to, be, reused, in, addition, to, steel, and, other, useful, materials, however, ships, particularly, older, vessels, can, contain, many, substances, that, are, banned, or, considered, dangerous, in, developed, countries, asbestos, and, polychlorinated, biphenyls, pcbs, are, typical, examples, asbestos, was, used, heavily, in, ship, construction, until, it, was, finally, banned, in, most, of, the, developed, world, in, the, mid, 1980s, currently, the, costs, associated, with, removing, asbestos, along, with, the, potentially, expensive, insurance, and, health, risks, have, meant, that, ship, breaking, in, most, developed, countries, is, no, longer, economically, viable, removing, the, metal, for, scrap, can, potentially, cost, more, than, the, scrap, value, of, the, metal, itself, in, most, of, the, developing, world, however, shipyards, can, operate, without, the, risk, of, personal, injury, lawsuits, or, workers, health, claims, meaning, many, of, these, shipyards, may, operate, with, high, health, risks, furthermore, workers, are, paid, very, low, rates, with, no, overtime, or, other, allowances, protective, equipment, is, sometimes, absent, or, inadequate, dangerous, vapors, and, fumes, from, burning, materials, can, be, inhaled, and, dusty, asbestos, laden, areas, around, such, breakdown, locations, are, commonplace, aside, from, the, health, of, the, yard, workers, in, recent, years, ship, breaking, has, also, become, an, issue, of, major, environmental, concern, many, developing, nations, in, which, ship, breaking, yards, are, located, have, lax, or, no, environmental, law, enabling, large, quantities, of, highly, toxic, materials, to, escape, into, the, environment, and, causing, serious, health, problems, among, ship, breakers, the, local, population, and, wildlife, environmental, campaign, groups, such, as, greenpeace, have, made, the, issue, a, high, priority, for, their, campaigns, model, ships, lists, ship, sizes
