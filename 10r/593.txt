a, theodolite, i, d, l, a, t, is, a, precision, optical, instrument, for, measuring, angles, between, designated, visible, points, in, the, horizontal, and, vertical, planes, the, traditional, use, has, been, for, land, surveying, but, it, is, also, used, extensively, for, building, and, infrastructure, construction, and, some, specialized, applications, such, as, meteorology, and, rocket, launching, it, consists, of, a, moveable, telescope, mounted, so, it, can, rotate, around, horizontal, and, vertical, axes, and, provide, angular, readouts, these, indicate, the, orientation, of, the, telescope, and, are, used, to, relate, the, first, point, sighted, through, the, telescope, to, subsequent, sightings, of, other, points, from, the, same, theodolite, position, these, angles, can, be, measured, with, accuracies, down, to, microradians, or, seconds, of, arc, from, these, readings, a, plan, can, be, drawn, or, objects, can, be, positioned, in, accordance, with, an, existing, plan, the, modern, theodolite, has, evolved, into, what, is, known, as, a, total, station, where, angles, and, distances, are, measured, electronically, and, are, read, directly, to, computer, memory, in, a, transit, theodolite, the, telescope, is, short, enough, to, rotate, about, the, trunnion, axis, turning, the, telescope, through, the, vertical, plane, through, the, zenith, for, non, transit, instruments, vertical, rotation, is, restricted, to, a, limited, arc, the, optical, level, is, sometimes, mistaken, for, a, theodolite, but, it, does, not, measure, vertical, angles, and, is, used, only, for, leveling, on, a, horizontal, plane, though, often, combined, with, medium, accuracy, horizontal, range, and, direction, measurements, temporary, adjustments, are, a, set, of, operations, necessary, in, order, to, make, a, theodolite, ready, for, taking, observations, at, a, station, these, include, its, setting, up, centering, leveling, up, and, elimination, of, parallax, and, are, achieved, in, four, steps, sightings, are, taken, by, the, surveyor, who, adjusts, the, telescope, s, vertical, and, horizontal, angular, orientation, so, the, cross, hairs, align, with, the, desired, sighting, point, both, angles, are, read, either, from, exposed, or, internal, scales, and, recorded, the, next, object, is, then, sighted, and, recorded, without, moving, the, position, of, the, instrument, and, tripod, the, earliest, angular, readouts, were, from, open, vernier, scales, directly, visible, to, the, eye, gradually, these, scales, were, enclosed, for, physical, protection, and, finally, became, an, indirect, optical, readout, with, convoluted, light, paths, to, bring, them, to, a, convenient, place, on, the, instrument, for, viewing, the, modern, digital, theodolites, have, electronic, displays, index, error, horizontal, axis, error, trunnion, axis, error, and, collimation, error, are, regularly, determined, by, calibration, and, are, removed, by, mechanical, adjustment, their, existence, is, taken, into, account, in, the, choice, of, measurement, procedure, in, order, to, eliminate, their, effect, on, the, measurement, results, of, the, theodolite, prior, to, the, theodolite, instruments, such, as, the, groma, geometric, square, and, the, dioptra, and, various, other, graduated, circles, see, circumferentor, and, semicircles, see, graphometer, were, used, to, obtain, either, vertical, or, horizontal, angle, measurements, over, time, their, functions, were, combined, into, a, single, instrument, that, could, measure, both, angles, simultaneously, the, first, occurrence, of, the, word, theodolite, is, found, in, the, surveying, textbook, a, geometric, practice, named, pantometria, 1571, by, leonard, digges, the, origin, of, the, word, is, unknown, the, first, part, of, the, neo, latin, theo, delitus, might, stem, from, the, greek, to, behold, or, look, attentively, upon, the, second, part, is, often, attributed, to, an, unscholarly, variation, of, the, greek, word, meaning, evident, or, clear, other, neo, latin, or, greek, derivations, have, been, suggested, as, well, as, an, english, origin, from, the, alidade, the, early, forerunners, of, the, theodolite, were, sometimes, azimuth, instruments, for, measuring, horizontal, angles, while, others, had, an, altazimuth, mount, for, measuring, horizontal, and, vertical, angles, gregorius, reisch, illustrated, an, altazimuth, instrument, in, the, appendix, of, his, 1512, book, margarita, philosophica, martin, waldseem, ller, a, topographer, and, cartographer, made, the, device, in, that, year, calling, it, the, polimetrum, in, digges, s, book, of, 1571, the, term, theodolite, was, applied, to, an, instrument, for, measuring, horizontal, angles, only, but, he, also, described, an, instrument, that, measured, both, altitude, and, azimuth, which, he, called, a, topographicall, instrument, possibly, the, first, instrument, approximating, to, a, true, theodolite, was, the, built, by, josua, habemel, in, 1576, complete, with, compass, and, tripod, the, 1728, cyclopaedia, compares, graphometer, to, half, theodolite, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, the, instrument, for, measuring, horizontal, angles, only, was, called, a, simple, theodolite, and, the, altazimuth, instrument, the, plain, theodolite, the, first, instrument, to, combine, the, essential, features, of, the, modern, theodolite, was, built, in, 1725, by, jonathan, sisson, this, instrument, had, an, altazimuth, mount, with, a, sighting, telescope, the, base, plate, had, spirit, levels, compass, and, adjusting, screws, the, circles, were, read, with, a, vernier, scale, the, theodolite, became, a, modern, accurate, instrument, in, 1787, with, the, introduction, of, jesse, ramsden, s, famous, great, theodolite, which, he, created, using, a, very, accurate, dividing, engine, of, his, own, design, ramsden, s, instruments, were, used, for, the, principal, triangulation, of, great, britain, at, this, time, the, highest, precision, instruments, were, made, in, england, by, such, makers, as, edward, troughton, later, the, first, practical, german, theodolites, were, made, by, breithaupt, together, with, utzschneider, reichenbach, and, fraunhofer, as, technology, progressed, the, vertical, partial, circle, was, replaced, with, a, full, circle, and, both, vertical, and, horizontal, circles, were, finely, graduated, this, was, the, transit, theodolite, this, type, of, theodolite, was, developed, from, 18th, century, astronomical, transit, instruments, used, to, measure, accurate, star, positions, the, technology, was, transferred, to, theodolites, in, the, early, 19th, century, by, instrument, makers, such, as, edward, troughton, and, william, simms, and, became, the, standard, theodolite, design, development, of, the, theodolite, was, spurred, on, by, specific, needs, in, the, 1820s, progress, on, national, surveying, projects, such, as, the, ordnance, survey, in, britain, produced, a, requirement, for, theodolites, capable, of, providing, sufficient, accuracy, for, large, scale, triangulation, and, mapping, the, survey, of, india, at, this, time, produced, a, requirement, for, more, rugged, and, stable, instruments, such, as, the, everest, pattern, theodolite, with, its, lower, center, of, gravity, railway, engineers, working, in, the, 1830s, in, britain, commonly, referred, to, a, theodolite, as, a, transit, the, 1840s, was, the, start, of, a, period, of, rapid, railway, building, in, many, parts, of, the, world, which, resulted, in, a, high, demand, for, theodolites, wherever, railways, were, being, constructed, it, was, also, popular, with, american, railroad, engineers, pushing, west, and, it, replaced, the, railroad, compass, sextant, and, octant, theodolites, were, later, adapted, to, a, wider, variety, of, mountings, and, uses, in, the, 1870s, an, interesting, waterborne, version, of, the, theodolite, using, a, pendulum, device, to, counteract, wave, movement, was, invented, by, edward, samuel, ritchie, it, was, used, by, the, u, s, navy, to, take, the, first, precision, surveys, of, american, harbors, on, the, atlantic, and, gulf, coasts, in, the, early, 1920s, a, step, change, in, theodolite, design, occurred, with, the, introduction, of, the, wild, t2, made, by, the, swiss, wild, heerbrugg, company, heinrich, wild, designed, a, theodolite, with, divided, glass, circles, with, readings, from, both, sides, presented, at, a, single, eyepiece, close, to, the, telescope, so, the, observer, did, not, have, to, move, to, read, them, the, wild, instruments, were, not, only, smaller, easier, to, use, and, more, accurate, than, contemporary, rivals, but, also, sealed, from, rain, and, dust, canadian, surveyors, reported, that, while, the, wild, t2, with, 3, 75, inch, circles, was, not, able, to, provide, the, accuracy, for, primary, triangulation, it, was, the, equal, in, accuracy, to, a, 12, inch, traditional, design, the, wild, t2, t3, and, a1, instruments, were, made, for, many, years, in, 1926, a, conference, was, held, at, tavistock, in, devon, uk, where, wild, theodolites, were, compared, with, british, ones, the, wild, product, outclassed, the, british, theodolites, so, manufacturers, such, as, cooke, troughton, simms, and, hilger, watts, set, about, improving, the, accuracy, of, their, products, to, match, their, competition, cooke, troughton, and, simms, developed, the, tavistock, pattern, theodolite, and, later, the, vickers, v, 22, wild, went, on, to, develop, the, dk1, dkm1, dm2, dkm2, and, dkm3, for, kern, aarau, company, with, continuing, refinements, instruments, steadily, evolved, into, the, modern, theodolite, used, by, surveyors, today, by, 1977, wild, kern, and, hewlett, packard, were, all, offering, total, stations, which, combined, angular, measurements, electronic, distance, measurement, and, microchip, functions, in, a, single, unit, triangulation, as, invented, by, gemma, frisius, around, 1533, consists, of, making, such, direction, plots, of, the, surrounding, landscape, from, two, separate, standpoints, the, two, graphing, papers, are, superimposed, providing, a, scale, model, of, the, landscape, or, rather, the, targets, in, it, the, true, scale, can, be, obtained, by, measuring, one, distance, both, in, the, real, terrain, and, in, the, graphical, representation, modern, triangulation, as, e, g, practiced, by, snellius, is, the, same, procedure, executed, by, numerical, means, photogrammetric, block, adjustment, of, stereo, pairs, of, aerial, photographs, is, a, modern, three, dimensional, variant, in, the, late, 1780s, jesse, ramsden, a, yorkshireman, from, halifax, england, who, had, developed, the, dividing, engine, for, dividing, angular, scales, accurately, to, within, a, second, of, arc, 0, 0048, mrad, or, 4, 8, rad, was, commissioned, to, build, a, new, instrument, for, the, british, ordnance, survey, the, ramsden, theodolite, was, used, over, the, next, few, years, to, map, the, whole, of, southern, britain, by, triangulation, in, network, measurement, the, use, of, forced, centering, speeds, up, operations, while, maintaining, the, highest, precision, the, theodolite, or, the, target, can, be, rapidly, removed, from, or, socketed, into, the, forced, centering, plate, with, sub, millimeter, precision, nowadays, gps, antennas, used, for, geodetic, positioning, use, a, similar, mounting, system, the, height, of, the, reference, point, of, the, theodolite, or, the, target, above, the, ground, benchmark, must, be, measured, precisely, the, term, transit, theodolite, or, transit, for, short, refers, to, a, type, of, theodolite, where, the, telescope, is, short, enough, to, rotate, in, a, full, circle, on, its, horizontal, axis, as, well, as, around, its, vertical, axis, it, features, a, vertical, circle, which, is, graduated, through, the, full, 360, degrees, and, a, telescope, that, could, flip, over, transit, the, scope, by, reversing, the, telescope, and, at, the, same, time, rotating, the, instrument, through, 180, degrees, about, the, vertical, axis, the, instrument, can, be, used, in, plate, left, or, plate, right, modes, plate, refers, to, the, vertical, protractor, circle, by, measuring, the, same, horizontal, and, vertical, angles, in, these, two, modes, and, then, averaging, the, results, centering, and, collimating, errors, in, the, instrument, can, be, eliminated, some, transit, instruments, are, capable, of, reading, angles, directly, to, thirty, arc, seconds, 0, 15, mrad, modern, theodolites, are, usually, of, the, transit, theodolite, design, but, engraved, plates, have, been, replaced, with, glass, plates, designed, to, be, read, with, light, emitting, diodes, and, computer, circuitry, greatly, improving, accuracy, up, to, arc, second, 0, 005, mrad, levels, there, is, a, long, history, of, theodolite, use, in, measuring, winds, aloft, by, using, specially, manufactured, theodolites, to, track, the, horizontal, and, vertical, angles, of, special, weather, balloons, called, ceiling, balloons, or, pilot, balloons, pibal, early, attempts, at, this, were, made, in, the, opening, years, of, the, nineteenth, century, but, the, instruments, and, procedures, weren, t, fully, developed, until, a, hundred, years, later, this, method, was, extensively, used, in, world, war, ii, and, thereafter, and, was, gradually, replaced, by, radio, and, gps, measuring, systems, from, the, 1980s, onward, the, pibal, theodolite, uses, a, prism, to, bend, the, optical, path, by, 90, degrees, so, the, operator, s, eye, position, does, not, change, as, the, elevation, is, changed, through, a, complete, 180, degrees, the, theodolite, is, typically, mounted, on, a, rugged, steel, stand, set, up, so, it, is, level, and, pointed, north, with, the, altitude, and, azimuth, scales, reading, zero, degrees, a, balloon, is, released, in, front, of, the, theodolite, and, its, position, is, precisely, tracked, usually, once, a, minute, the, balloons, are, carefully, constructed, and, filled, so, their, rate, of, ascent, can, be, known, fairly, accurately, in, advance, mathematical, calculations, on, time, rate, of, ascent, azimuth, and, angular, altitude, can, produce, good, estimates, of, wind, speed, and, direction, at, various, altitudes, in, modern, electronic, theodolites, the, readout, of, the, horizontal, and, vertical, circles, is, usually, done, with, a, rotary, encoder, these, produce, signals, indicating, the, altitude, and, azimuth, of, the, telescope, which, are, fed, to, a, microprocessor, ccd, sensors, have, been, added, to, the, focal, plane, of, the, telescope, allowing, both, auto, targeting, and, the, automated, measurement, of, residual, target, offset, all, this, is, implemented, in, embedded, software, of, the, processor, many, modern, theodolites, are, equipped, with, integrated, electro, optical, distance, measuring, devices, generally, infrared, based, allowing, the, measurement, in, one, step, of, complete, three, dimensional, vectors, albeit, in, instrument, defined, polar, coordinates, which, can, then, be, transformed, to, a, preexisting, coordinate, system, in, the, area, by, means, of, a, sufficient, number, of, control, points, this, technique, is, called, a, resection, solution, or, free, station, position, surveying, and, is, widely, used, in, mapping, surveying, such, instruments, are, intelligent, theodolites, called, self, registering, tacheometers, or, colloquially, total, stations, and, perform, all, the, necessary, angular, and, distance, calculations, and, the, results, or, raw, data, can, be, downloaded, to, external, processors, such, as, ruggedized, laptops, pdas, or, programmable, calculators, a, gyrotheodolite, is, used, when, the, north, south, reference, bearing, of, the, meridian, is, required, in, the, absence, of, astronomical, star, sights, this, occurs, mainly, in, the, underground, mining, industry, and, in, tunnel, engineering, for, example, where, a, conduit, must, pass, under, a, river, a, vertical, shaft, on, each, side, of, the, river, might, be, connected, by, a, horizontal, tunnel, a, gyrotheodolite, can, be, operated, at, the, surface, and, then, again, at, the, foot, of, the, shafts, to, identify, the, directions, needed, to, tunnel, between, the, base, of, the, two, shafts, unlike, an, artificial, horizon, or, inertial, navigation, system, a, gyrotheodolite, cannot, be, relocated, while, it, is, operating, it, must, be, restarted, again, at, each, site, the, gyrotheodolite, comprises, a, normal, theodolite, with, an, attachment, that, contains, a, gyrocompass, a, device, which, senses, the, rotation, of, the, earth, in, order, to, find, true, north, and, thus, in, conjunction, with, the, direction, of, gravity, the, plane, of, the, meridian, the, meridian, is, the, plane, that, contains, both, the, axis, of, the, earth, s, rotation, and, the, observer, the, intersection, of, the, meridian, plane, with, the, horizontal, defines, the, true, north, south, direction, found, in, this, way, unlike, magnetic, compasses, gyrocompasses, are, able, to, find, true, north, the, surface, direction, toward, the, north, pole, a, gyrotheodolite, will, function, at, the, equator, and, in, both, the, northern, and, southern, hemispheres, the, meridian, is, undefined, at, the, geographic, poles, a, gyrotheodolite, cannot, be, used, at, the, poles, where, the, earth, s, axis, is, precisely, perpendicular, to, the, horizontal, axis, of, the, spinner, indeed, it, is, not, normally, used, within, about, 15, degrees, of, the, pole, where, the, angle, between, the, earth, s, rotation, and, the, direction, of, gravity, is, too, small, for, it, to, work, reliably, when, available, astronomical, star, sights, are, able, to, give, the, meridian, bearing, to, better, than, one, hundred, times, the, accuracy, of, the, gyrotheodolite, where, this, extra, precision, is, not, required, the, gyrotheodolite, is, able, to, produce, a, result, quickly, without, the, need, for, night, observations
