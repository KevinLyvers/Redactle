a, steam, locomotive, is, a, locomotive, that, provides, the, force, to, move, itself, and, other, vehicles, by, means, of, the, expansion, of, steam, 80, it, is, fuelled, by, burning, combustible, material, usually, coal, oil, or, rarely, wood, to, heat, water, in, the, locomotive, s, boiler, to, the, point, where, it, becomes, gaseous, and, its, volume, increases, 1, 700, times, functionally, it, is, a, steam, engine, on, wheels, in, most, locomotives, the, steam, is, admitted, alternately, to, each, end, of, its, cylinders, in, which, pistons, are, mechanically, connected, to, the, locomotive, s, main, wheels, fuel, and, water, supplies, are, usually, carried, with, the, locomotive, either, on, the, locomotive, itself, or, in, a, tender, coupled, to, it, variations, in, this, general, design, include, electrically, powered, boilers, turbines, in, place, of, pistons, and, using, steam, generated, externally, steam, locomotives, were, first, developed, in, the, united, kingdom, during, the, early, 19th, century, and, used, for, railway, transport, until, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, richard, trevithick, built, the, first, steam, locomotive, known, to, have, hauled, a, load, over, a, distance, at, pen, y, darren, in, 1804, although, he, produced, an, earlier, locomotive, for, trial, at, coalbrookdale, in, 1802, salamanca, built, in, 1812, by, matthew, murray, for, the, middleton, railway, was, the, first, commercially, successful, steam, locomotive, locomotion, no, 1, built, by, george, stephenson, and, his, son, robert, s, company, robert, stephenson, and, company, was, the, first, steam, locomotive, to, haul, passengers, on, a, public, railway, the, stockton, and, darlington, railway, in, 1825, rapid, development, ensued, in, 1830, george, stephenson, opened, the, first, public, inter, city, railway, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, after, the, success, of, rocket, at, the, 1829, rainhill, trials, had, proved, that, steam, locomotives, could, perform, such, duties, robert, stephenson, and, company, was, the, pre, eminent, builder, of, steam, locomotives, in, the, first, decades, of, steam, for, railways, in, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, and, much, of, europe, towards, the, end, of, the, steam, era, a, longstanding, british, emphasis, on, speed, culminated, in, a, record, still, unbroken, of, 126, miles, per, hour, 203, kilometres, per, hour, by, lner, class, a4, 4468, mallard, however, there, are, long, standing, claims, that, the, pennsylvania, railroad, class, s1, achieved, speeds, upwards, of, 150, mph, though, this, was, never, officially, proven, in, the, united, states, larger, loading, gauges, allowed, the, development, of, very, large, heavy, locomotives, such, as, the, union, pacific, big, boy, which, weighs, 540, long, tons, 550, t, 600, short, tons, and, has, a, tractive, effort, of, 135, 375, pounds, force, 602, 180, newtons, beginning, in, the, early, 1900s, steam, locomotives, were, gradually, superseded, by, electric, and, diesel, locomotives, with, railways, fully, converting, to, electric, and, diesel, power, beginning, in, the, late, 1930s, the, majority, of, steam, locomotives, were, retired, from, regular, service, by, the, 1980s, although, several, continue, to, run, on, tourist, and, heritage, lines, the, earliest, railways, employed, horses, to, draw, carts, along, rail, tracks, in, 1784, william, murdoch, a, scottish, inventor, built, a, small, scale, prototype, of, a, steam, road, locomotive, in, birmingham, a, full, scale, rail, steam, locomotive, was, proposed, by, william, reynolds, around, 1787, an, early, working, model, of, a, steam, rail, locomotive, was, designed, and, constructed, by, steamboat, pioneer, john, fitch, in, the, us, during, 1794, some, sources, claim, fitch, s, model, was, operable, already, by, the, 1780s, and, that, he, demonstrated, his, locomotive, to, george, washington, his, steam, locomotive, used, interior, bladed, wheels, guided, by, rails, or, tracks, the, model, still, exists, at, the, ohio, historical, society, museum, in, columbus, us, the, authenticity, and, date, of, this, locomotive, is, disputed, by, some, experts, and, a, workable, steam, train, would, have, to, await, the, invention, of, the, high, pressure, steam, engine, by, richard, trevithick, who, pioneered, the, use, of, steam, locomotives, the, first, full, scale, working, railway, steam, locomotive, was, the, 3, ft, 914, mm, gauge, coalbrookdale, locomotive, built, by, trevithick, in, 1802, it, was, constructed, for, the, coalbrookdale, ironworks, in, shropshire, in, the, united, kingdom, though, no, record, of, it, working, there, has, survived, on, 21, february, 1804, the, first, recorded, steam, hauled, railway, journey, took, place, as, another, of, trevithick, s, locomotives, hauled, a, train, along, the, 4, ft, 4, in, 1, 321, mm, wide, tramway, from, the, pen, y, darren, ironworks, near, merthyr, tydfil, to, abercynon, in, south, wales, accompanied, by, andrew, vivian, it, ran, with, mixed, success, the, design, incorporated, a, number, of, important, innovations, that, included, using, high, pressure, steam, which, reduced, the, weight, of, the, engine, and, increased, its, efficiency, trevithick, visited, the, newcastle, area, in, 1804, and, had, a, ready, audience, of, colliery, coal, mine, owners, and, engineers, the, visit, was, so, successful, that, the, colliery, railways, in, north, east, england, became, the, leading, centre, for, experimentation, and, development, of, the, steam, locomotive, trevithick, continued, his, own, steam, propulsion, experiments, through, another, trio, of, locomotives, concluding, with, the, catch, me, who, can, in, 1808, first, in, the, world, to, haul, fare, paying, passengers, in, 1812, matthew, murray, s, successful, twin, cylinder, rack, locomotive, salamanca, first, ran, on, the, edge, railed, rack, and, pinion, middleton, railway, another, well, known, early, locomotive, was, puffing, billy, built, 1813, 14, by, engineer, william, hedley, it, was, intended, to, work, on, the, wylam, colliery, near, newcastle, upon, tyne, this, locomotive, is, the, oldest, preserved, and, is, on, static, display, at, the, science, museum, london, george, stephenson, a, former, miner, working, as, an, engine, wright, at, killingworth, colliery, developed, up, to, sixteen, killingworth, locomotives, including, bl, cher, in, 1814, another, in, 1815, and, a, newly, identified, killingworth, billy, in, 1816, he, also, constructed, the, duke, in, 1817, for, the, kilmarnock, and, troon, railway, which, was, the, first, steam, locomotive, to, work, in, scotland, in, 1825, stephenson, built, locomotion, no, 1, for, the, stockton, and, darlington, railway, north, east, england, which, was, the, first, public, steam, railway, in, the, world, in, 1829, his, son, robert, built, in, newcastle, the, rocket, which, was, entered, in, and, won, the, rainhill, trials, this, success, led, to, the, company, emerging, as, the, pre, eminent, builder, of, steam, locomotives, used, on, railways, in, the, uk, us, and, much, of, europe, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, opened, a, year, later, making, exclusive, use, of, steam, power, for, passenger, and, goods, trains, before, the, arrival, of, british, imports, some, domestic, steam, locomotive, prototypes, were, built, and, tested, in, the, united, states, including, john, fitch, s, miniature, prototype, a, prominent, full, sized, example, was, col, john, steven, s, steam, wagon, which, was, demonstrated, on, a, loop, of, track, in, hoboken, new, jersey, in, 1825, many, of, the, earliest, locomotives, for, commercial, use, on, american, railroads, were, imported, from, great, britain, including, first, the, stourbridge, lion, and, later, the, john, bull, however, a, domestic, locomotive, manufacturing, industry, was, soon, established, in, 1830, the, baltimore, and, ohio, railroad, s, tom, thumb, designed, by, peter, cooper, was, the, first, commercial, us, built, locomotive, to, run, in, america, it, was, intended, as, a, demonstration, of, the, potential, of, steam, traction, rather, than, as, a, revenue, earning, locomotive, the, dewitt, clinton, built, in, 1831, for, the, mohawk, and, hudson, railroad, was, a, notable, early, locomotive, as, of, 2021, the, original, john, bull, was, on, static, display, in, the, national, museum, of, american, history, in, washington, d, c, the, replica, is, preserved, at, the, railroad, museum, of, pennsylvania, the, first, railway, service, outside, the, united, kingdom, and, north, america, was, opened, in, 1829, in, france, between, saint, etienne, and, lyon, it, was, initially, limited, to, animal, traction, and, converted, to, steam, traction, early, 1831, using, seguin, locomotives, the, first, steam, locomotive, in, service, in, europe, outside, of, france, was, named, the, elephant, which, on, 5, may, 1835, hauled, a, train, on, the, first, line, in, belgium, linking, mechelen, and, brussels, in, germany, the, first, working, steam, locomotive, was, a, rack, and, pinion, engine, similar, to, the, salamanca, designed, by, the, british, locomotive, pioneer, john, blenkinsop, built, in, june, 1816, by, johann, friedrich, krigar, in, the, royal, berlin, iron, foundry, k, nigliche, eisengie, erei, zu, berlin, the, locomotive, ran, on, a, circular, track, in, the, factory, yard, it, was, the, first, locomotive, to, be, built, on, the, european, mainland, and, the, first, steam, powered, passenger, service, curious, onlookers, could, ride, in, the, attached, coaches, for, a, fee, it, is, portrayed, on, a, new, year, s, badge, for, the, royal, foundry, dated, 1816, another, locomotive, was, built, using, the, same, system, in, 1817, they, were, to, be, used, on, pit, railways, in, k, nigsh, tte, and, in, luisenthal, on, the, saar, today, part, of, v, lklingen, but, neither, could, be, returned, to, working, order, after, being, dismantled, moved, and, reassembled, on, 7, december, 1835, the, adler, ran, for, the, first, time, between, nuremberg, and, f, rth, on, the, bavarian, ludwig, railway, it, was, the, 118th, engine, from, the, locomotive, works, of, robert, stephenson, and, stood, under, patent, protection, in, russia, the, first, steam, locomotive, was, built, in, 1834, by, cherepanovs, however, it, suffered, from, the, lack, of, coal, in, the, area, and, was, replaced, with, horse, traction, after, all, the, woods, nearby, had, been, cut, down, the, first, russian, tsarskoye, selo, steam, railway, started, in, 1837, with, locomotives, purchased, from, robert, stephenson, and, company, in, 1837, the, first, steam, railway, started, in, austria, on, the, emperor, ferdinand, northern, railway, between, vienna, floridsdorf, and, deutsch, wagram, the, oldest, continually, working, steam, engine, in, the, world, also, runs, in, austria, the, gkb, 671, built, in, 1860, has, never, been, taken, out, of, service, and, is, still, used, for, special, excursions, in, 1838, the, third, steam, locomotive, to, be, built, in, germany, the, saxonia, was, manufactured, by, the, maschinenbaufirma, bigau, near, dresden, built, by, prof, johann, andreas, schubert, the, first, independently, designed, locomotive, in, germany, was, the, beuth, built, by, august, borsig, in, 1841, the, first, locomotive, produced, by, henschel, werke, in, kassel, the, drache, was, delivered, in, 1848, the, first, steam, locomotives, operating, in, italy, were, the, bayard, and, the, vesuvio, running, on, the, napoli, portici, line, in, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, the, first, railway, line, over, swiss, territory, was, the, strasbourg, basel, line, opened, in, 1844, three, years, later, in, 1847, the, first, fully, swiss, railway, line, the, spanisch, br, tli, bahn, from, z, rich, to, baden, was, opened, the, arid, nature, of, south, australia, posed, distinctive, challenges, to, their, early, steam, locomotion, network, the, high, concentration, of, magnesium, chloride, in, the, well, water, bore, water, used, in, locomotive, boilers, on, the, trans, australian, railway, caused, serious, and, expensive, maintenance, problems, at, no, point, along, its, route, does, the, line, cross, a, permanent, freshwater, watercourse, so, bore, water, had, to, be, relied, on, no, inexpensive, treatment, for, the, highly, mineralised, water, was, available, and, locomotive, boilers, were, lasting, less, than, a, quarter, of, the, time, normally, expected, in, the, days, of, steam, locomotion, about, half, the, total, train, load, was, water, for, the, engine, the, line, s, operator, commonwealth, railways, was, an, early, adopter, of, the, diesel, electric, locomotive, the, fire, tube, boiler, was, standard, practice, for, steam, locomotive, although, other, types, of, boiler, were, evaluated, they, were, not, widely, used, except, for, some, 1, 000, locomotives, in, hungary, which, used, the, water, tube, brotan, boiler, a, boiler, consists, of, a, firebox, where, the, fuel, is, burned, a, barrel, where, water, is, turned, into, steam, and, a, smokebox, which, is, kept, at, a, slightly, lower, pressure, than, outside, the, firebox, solid, fuel, such, as, wood, coal, or, coke, is, thrown, into, the, firebox, through, a, door, by, a, fireman, onto, a, set, of, grates, which, hold, the, fuel, in, a, bed, as, it, burns, ash, falls, through, the, grate, into, an, ashpan, if, oil, is, used, as, the, fuel, a, door, is, needed, for, adjusting, the, air, flow, maintaining, the, firebox, and, cleaning, the, oil, jets, the, fire, tube, boiler, has, internal, tubes, connecting, the, firebox, to, the, smokebox, through, which, the, combustion, gases, flow, transferring, heat, to, the, water, all, the, tubes, together, provide, a, large, contact, area, called, the, tube, heating, surface, between, the, gas, and, water, in, the, boiler, boiler, water, surrounds, the, firebox, to, stop, the, metal, from, becoming, too, hot, this, is, another, area, where, the, gas, transfers, heat, to, the, water, and, is, called, the, firebox, heating, surface, ash, and, char, collect, in, the, smokebox, as, the, gas, gets, drawn, up, the, chimney, stack, or, smokestack, in, the, us, by, the, exhaust, steam, from, the, cylinders, the, pressure, in, the, boiler, has, to, be, monitored, using, a, gauge, mounted, in, the, cab, steam, pressure, can, be, released, manually, by, the, driver, or, fireman, if, the, pressure, reaches, the, boiler, s, design, working, limit, a, safety, valve, opens, automatically, to, reduce, the, pressure, and, avoid, a, catastrophic, accident, the, exhaust, steam, from, the, engine, cylinders, shoots, out, of, a, nozzle, pointing, up, the, chimney, in, the, smokebox, the, steam, entrains, or, drags, the, smokebox, gases, with, it, which, maintains, a, lower, pressure, in, the, smokebox, than, that, under, the, firebox, grate, this, pressure, difference, causes, air, to, flow, up, through, the, coal, bed, and, keeps, the, fire, burning, the, search, for, thermal, efficiency, greater, than, that, of, a, typical, fire, tube, boiler, led, engineers, such, as, nigel, gresley, to, consider, the, water, tube, boiler, although, he, tested, the, concept, on, the, lner, class, w1, the, difficulties, during, development, exceeded, the, will, to, increase, efficiency, by, that, route, the, steam, generated, in, the, boiler, not, only, moves, the, locomotive, but, is, also, used, to, operate, other, devices, such, as, the, whistle, the, air, compressor, for, the, brakes, the, pump, for, replenishing, the, water, in, the, boiler, and, the, passenger, car, heating, system, the, constant, demand, for, steam, requires, a, periodic, replacement, of, water, in, the, boiler, the, water, is, kept, in, a, tank, in, the, locomotive, tender, or, wrapped, around, the, boiler, in, the, case, of, a, tank, locomotive, periodic, stops, are, required, to, refill, the, tanks, an, alternative, was, a, scoop, installed, under, the, tender, that, collected, water, as, the, train, passed, over, a, track, pan, located, between, the, rails, while, the, locomotive, is, producing, steam, the, amount, of, water, in, the, boiler, is, constantly, monitored, by, looking, at, the, water, level, in, a, transparent, tube, or, sight, glass, efficient, and, safe, operation, of, the, boiler, requires, keeping, the, level, in, between, lines, marked, on, the, sight, glass, if, the, water, level, is, too, high, steam, production, falls, efficiency, is, lost, and, water, is, carried, out, with, the, steam, into, the, cylinders, possibly, causing, mechanical, damage, more, seriously, if, the, water, level, gets, too, low, the, crown, sheet, top, sheet, of, the, firebox, becomes, exposed, without, water, on, top, of, the, sheet, to, transfer, away, the, heat, of, combustion, it, softens, and, fails, letting, high, pressure, steam, into, the, firebox, and, the, cab, the, development, of, the, fusible, plug, a, temperature, sensitive, device, ensured, a, controlled, venting, of, steam, into, the, firebox, to, warn, the, fireman, to, add, water, scale, builds, up, in, the, boiler, and, prevents, adequate, heat, transfer, and, corrosion, eventually, degrades, the, boiler, materials, to, the, point, where, it, needs, to, be, rebuilt, or, replaced, start, up, on, a, large, engine, may, take, hours, of, preliminary, heating, of, the, boiler, water, before, sufficient, steam, is, available, although, the, boiler, is, typically, placed, horizontally, for, locomotives, designed, to, work, in, locations, with, steep, slopes, it, may, be, more, appropriate, to, consider, a, vertical, boiler, or, one, mounted, such, that, the, boiler, remains, horizontal, but, the, wheels, are, inclined, to, suit, the, slope, of, the, rails, the, steam, generated, in, the, boiler, fills, the, space, above, the, water, in, the, partially, filled, boiler, its, maximum, working, pressure, is, limited, by, spring, loaded, safety, valves, it, is, then, collected, either, in, a, perforated, tube, fitted, above, the, water, level, or, by, a, dome, that, often, houses, the, regulator, valve, or, throttle, the, purpose, of, which, is, to, control, the, amount, of, steam, leaving, the, boiler, the, steam, then, either, travels, directly, along, and, down, a, steam, pipe, to, the, engine, unit, or, may, first, pass, into, the, wet, header, of, a, superheater, the, role, of, the, latter, being, to, improve, thermal, efficiency, and, eliminate, water, droplets, suspended, in, the, saturated, steam, the, state, in, which, it, leaves, the, boiler, on, leaving, the, superheater, the, steam, exits, the, dry, header, of, the, superheater, and, passes, down, a, steam, pipe, entering, the, steam, chests, adjacent, to, the, cylinders, of, a, reciprocating, engine, inside, each, steam, chest, is, a, sliding, valve, that, distributes, the, steam, via, ports, that, connect, the, steam, chest, to, the, ends, of, the, cylinder, space, the, role, of, the, valves, is, twofold, admission, of, each, fresh, dose, of, steam, and, exhaust, of, the, used, steam, once, it, has, done, its, work, the, cylinders, are, double, acting, with, steam, admitted, to, each, side, of, the, piston, in, turn, in, a, two, cylinder, locomotive, one, cylinder, is, located, on, each, side, of, the, vehicle, the, cranks, are, set, 90, out, of, phase, during, a, full, rotation, of, the, driving, wheel, steam, provides, four, power, strokes, each, cylinder, receives, two, injections, of, steam, per, revolution, the, first, stroke, is, to, the, front, of, the, piston, and, the, second, stroke, to, the, rear, of, the, piston, hence, two, working, strokes, consequently, two, deliveries, of, steam, onto, each, piston, face, in, the, two, cylinders, generates, a, full, revolution, of, the, driving, wheel, each, piston, is, attached, to, the, driving, axle, on, each, side, by, a, connecting, rod, and, the, driving, wheels, are, connected, together, by, coupling, rods, to, transmit, power, from, the, main, driver, to, the, other, wheels, note, that, at, the, two, dead, centres, when, the, connecting, rod, is, on, the, same, axis, as, the, crankpin, on, the, driving, wheel, the, connecting, rod, applies, no, torque, to, the, wheel, therefore, if, both, cranksets, could, be, at, dead, centre, at, the, same, time, and, the, wheels, should, happen, to, stop, in, this, position, the, locomotive, could, not, start, moving, therefore, the, crankpins, are, attached, to, the, wheels, at, a, 90, angle, to, each, other, so, only, one, side, can, be, at, dead, centre, at, a, time, each, piston, transmits, power, through, a, crosshead, connecting, rod, main, rod, in, the, us, and, a, crankpin, on, the, driving, wheel, main, driver, in, the, us, or, to, a, crank, on, a, driving, axle, the, movement, of, the, valves, in, the, steam, chest, is, controlled, through, a, set, of, rods, and, linkages, called, the, valve, gear, actuated, from, the, driving, axle, or, from, the, crankpin, the, valve, gear, includes, devices, that, allow, reversing, the, engine, adjusting, valve, travel, and, the, timing, of, the, admission, and, exhaust, events, the, cut, off, point, determines, the, moment, when, the, valve, blocks, a, steam, port, cutting, off, admission, steam, and, thus, determining, the, proportion, of, the, stroke, during, which, steam, is, admitted, into, the, cylinder, for, example, a, 50, cut, off, admits, steam, for, half, the, stroke, of, the, piston, the, remainder, of, the, stroke, is, driven, by, the, expansive, force, of, the, steam, careful, use, of, cut, off, provides, economical, use, of, steam, and, in, turn, reduces, fuel, and, water, consumption, the, reversing, lever, johnson, bar, in, the, us, or, screw, reverser, if, so, equipped, that, controls, the, cut, off, therefore, performs, a, similar, function, to, a, gearshift, in, an, automobile, maximum, cut, off, providing, maximum, tractive, effort, at, the, expense, of, efficiency, is, used, to, pull, away, from, a, standing, start, whilst, a, cut, off, as, low, as, 10, is, used, when, cruising, providing, reduced, tractive, effort, and, therefore, lower, fuel, water, consumption, exhaust, steam, is, directed, upwards, out, of, the, locomotive, through, the, chimney, by, way, of, a, nozzle, called, a, blastpipe, creating, the, familiar, chuffing, sound, of, the, steam, locomotive, the, blastpipe, is, placed, at, a, strategic, point, inside, the, smokebox, that, is, at, the, same, time, traversed, by, the, combustion, gases, drawn, through, the, boiler, and, grate, by, the, action, of, the, steam, blast, the, combining, of, the, two, streams, steam, and, exhaust, gases, is, crucial, to, the, efficiency, of, any, steam, locomotive, and, the, internal, profiles, of, the, chimney, or, strictly, speaking, the, ejector, require, careful, design, and, adjustment, this, has, been, the, object, of, intensive, studies, by, a, number, of, engineers, and, often, ignored, by, others, sometimes, with, catastrophic, consequences, the, fact, that, the, draught, depends, on, the, exhaust, pressure, means, that, power, delivery, and, power, generation, are, automatically, self, adjusting, among, other, things, a, balance, has, to, be, struck, between, obtaining, sufficient, draught, for, combustion, whilst, giving, the, exhaust, gases, and, particles, sufficient, time, to, be, consumed, in, the, past, a, strong, draught, could, lift, the, fire, off, the, grate, or, cause, the, ejection, of, unburnt, particles, of, fuel, dirt, and, pollution, for, which, steam, locomotives, had, an, unenviable, reputation, moreover, the, pumping, action, of, the, exhaust, has, the, counter, effect, of, exerting, back, pressure, on, the, side, of, the, piston, receiving, steam, thus, slightly, reducing, cylinder, power, designing, the, exhaust, ejector, became, a, specific, science, with, engineers, such, as, chapelon, giesl, and, porta, making, large, improvements, in, thermal, efficiency, and, a, significant, reduction, in, maintenance, time, and, pollution, a, similar, system, was, used, by, some, early, gasoline, kerosene, tractor, manufacturers, advance, rumely, hart, parr, the, exhaust, gas, volume, was, vented, through, a, cooling, tower, allowing, the, steam, exhaust, to, draw, more, air, past, the, radiator, running, gear, includes, the, brake, gear, wheel, sets, axleboxes, springing, and, the, motion, that, includes, connecting, rods, and, valve, gear, the, transmission, of, the, power, from, the, pistons, to, the, rails, and, the, behaviour, of, the, locomotive, as, a, vehicle, being, able, to, negotiate, curves, points, and, irregularities, in, the, track, is, of, paramount, importance, because, reciprocating, power, has, to, be, directly, applied, to, the, rail, from, 0, rpm, upwards, this, creates, the, problem, of, adhesion, of, the, driving, wheels, to, the, smooth, rail, surface, adhesive, weight, is, the, portion, of, the, locomotive, s, weight, bearing, on, the, driving, wheels, this, is, made, more, effective, if, a, pair, of, driving, wheels, is, able, to, make, the, most, of, its, axle, load, i, e, its, individual, share, of, the, adhesive, weight, equalising, beams, connecting, the, ends, of, leaf, springs, have, often, been, deemed, a, complication, in, britain, however, locomotives, fitted, with, the, beams, have, usually, been, less, prone, to, loss, of, traction, due, to, wheel, slip, suspension, using, equalizing, levers, between, driving, axles, and, between, driving, axles, and, trucks, was, standard, practice, on, north, american, locomotives, to, maintain, even, wheel, loads, when, operating, on, uneven, track, locomotives, with, total, adhesion, where, all, of, the, wheels, are, coupled, together, generally, lack, stability, at, speed, to, counter, this, locomotives, often, fit, unpowered, carrying, wheels, mounted, on, two, wheeled, trucks, or, four, wheeled, bogies, centred, by, springs, inverted, rockers, geared, rollers, that, help, to, guide, the, locomotive, through, curves, these, usually, take, on, weight, of, the, cylinders, at, the, front, or, the, firebox, at, the, rear, when, the, width, exceeds, that, of, the, mainframes, locomotives, with, multiple, coupled, wheels, on, a, rigid, chassis, would, have, unacceptable, flange, forces, on, tight, curves, giving, excessive, flange, and, rail, wear, track, spreading, and, wheel, climb, derailments, one, solution, was, to, remove, or, thin, the, flanges, on, an, axle, more, common, was, to, give, axles, end, play, and, use, lateral, motion, control, with, spring, or, inclined, plane, gravity, devices, railroads, generally, preferred, locomotives, with, fewer, axles, to, reduce, maintenance, costs, the, number, of, axles, required, was, dictated, by, the, maximum, axle, loading, of, the, railroad, in, question, a, builder, would, typically, add, axles, until, the, maximum, weight, on, any, one, axle, was, acceptable, to, the, railroad, s, maximum, axle, loading, a, locomotive, with, a, wheel, arrangement, of, two, lead, axles, two, drive, axles, and, one, trailing, axle, was, a, high, speed, machine, two, lead, axles, were, necessary, to, have, good, tracking, at, high, speeds, two, drive, axles, had, a, lower, reciprocating, mass, than, three, four, five, or, six, coupled, axles, they, were, thus, able, to, turn, at, very, high, speeds, due, to, the, lower, reciprocating, mass, a, trailing, axle, was, able, to, support, a, huge, firebox, hence, most, locomotives, with, the, wheel, arrangement, of, 4, 4, 2, american, type, atlantic, were, called, free, steamers, and, were, able, to, maintain, steam, pressure, regardless, of, throttle, setting, the, chassis, or, locomotive, frame, is, the, principal, structure, onto, which, the, boiler, is, mounted, and, which, incorporates, the, various, elements, of, the, running, gear, the, boiler, is, rigidly, mounted, on, a, saddle, beneath, the, smokebox, and, in, front, of, the, boiler, barrel, but, the, firebox, at, the, rear, is, allowed, to, slide, forward, and, backwards, to, allow, for, expansion, when, hot, european, locomotives, usually, use, plate, frames, where, two, vertical, flat, plates, form, the, main, chassis, with, a, variety, of, spacers, and, a, buffer, beam, at, each, end, to, form, a, rigid, structure, when, inside, cylinders, are, mounted, between, the, frames, the, plate, frames, are, a, single, large, casting, that, forms, a, major, support, element, the, axleboxes, slide, up, and, down, to, give, some, sprung, suspension, against, thickened, webs, attached, to, the, frame, called, hornblocks, american, practice, for, many, years, was, to, use, built, up, bar, frames, with, the, smokebox, saddle, cylinder, structure, and, drag, beam, integrated, therein, in, the, 1920s, with, the, introduction, of, superpower, the, cast, steel, locomotive, bed, became, the, norm, incorporating, frames, spring, hangers, motion, brackets, smokebox, saddle, and, cylinder, blocks, into, a, single, complex, sturdy, but, heavy, casting, a, sncf, design, study, using, welded, tubular, frames, gave, a, rigid, frame, with, a, 30, weight, reduction, generally, the, largest, locomotives, are, permanently, coupled, to, a, tender, that, carries, the, water, and, fuel, often, locomotives, working, shorter, distances, do, not, have, a, tender, and, carry, the, fuel, in, a, bunker, with, the, water, carried, in, tanks, placed, next, to, the, boiler, the, tanks, can, be, in, various, configurations, including, two, tanks, alongside, side, tanks, or, pannier, tanks, one, on, top, saddle, tank, or, one, between, the, frames, well, tank, the, fuel, used, depended, on, what, was, economically, available, to, the, railway, in, the, uk, and, other, parts, of, europe, plentiful, supplies, of, coal, made, this, the, obvious, choice, from, the, earliest, days, of, the, steam, engine, until, 1870, the, majority, of, locomotives, in, the, united, states, burned, wood, but, as, the, eastern, forests, were, cleared, coal, gradually, became, more, widely, used, until, it, became, the, dominant, fuel, worldwide, in, steam, locomotives, railways, serving, sugar, cane, farming, operations, burned, bagasse, a, byproduct, of, sugar, refining, in, the, us, the, ready, availability, and, low, price, of, oil, made, it, a, popular, steam, locomotive, fuel, after, 1900, for, the, southwestern, railroads, particularly, the, southern, pacific, in, the, australian, state, of, victoria, many, steam, locomotives, were, converted, to, heavy, oil, firing, after, world, war, ii, german, russian, australian, and, british, railways, experimented, with, using, coal, dust, to, fire, locomotives, during, world, war, 2, a, number, of, swiss, steam, shunting, locomotives, were, modified, to, use, electrically, heated, boilers, consuming, around, 480, kw, of, power, collected, from, an, overhead, line, with, a, pantograph, these, locomotives, were, significantly, less, efficient, than, electric, ones, they, were, used, because, switzerland, was, suffering, a, coal, shortage, because, of, the, war, but, had, access, to, plentiful, hydroelectricity, a, number, of, tourist, lines, and, heritage, locomotives, in, switzerland, argentina, and, australia, have, used, light, diesel, type, oil, water, was, supplied, at, stopping, places, and, locomotive, depots, from, a, dedicated, water, tower, connected, to, water, cranes, or, gantries, in, the, uk, the, us, and, france, water, troughs, track, pans, in, the, us, were, provided, on, some, main, lines, to, allow, locomotives, to, replenish, their, water, supply, without, stopping, from, rainwater, or, snowmelt, that, filled, the, trough, due, to, inclement, weather, this, was, achieved, by, using, a, deployable, water, scoop, fitted, under, the, tender, or, the, rear, water, tank, in, the, case, of, a, large, tank, engine, the, fireman, remotely, lowered, the, scoop, into, the, trough, the, speed, of, the, engine, forced, the, water, up, into, the, tank, and, the, scoop, was, raised, again, once, it, was, full, water, is, essential, for, the, operation, of, a, steam, locomotive, as, swengel, argued, it, has, the, highest, specific, heat, of, any, common, substance, that, is, more, thermal, energy, is, stored, by, heating, water, to, a, given, temperature, than, would, be, stored, by, heating, an, equal, mass, of, steel, or, copper, to, the, same, temperature, in, addition, the, property, of, vapourising, forming, steam, stores, additional, energy, without, increasing, the, temperature, water, is, a, very, satisfactory, medium, for, converting, thermal, energy, of, fuel, into, mechanical, energy, swengel, went, on, to, note, that, at, low, temperature, and, relatively, low, boiler, outputs, good, water, and, regular, boiler, washout, was, an, acceptable, practice, even, though, such, maintenance, was, high, as, steam, pressures, increased, however, a, problem, of, foaming, or, priming, developed, in, the, boiler, wherein, dissolved, solids, in, the, water, formed, tough, skinned, bubbles, inside, the, boiler, which, in, turn, were, carried, into, the, steam, pipes, and, could, blow, off, the, cylinder, heads, to, overcome, the, problem, hot, mineral, concentrated, water, was, deliberately, wasted, blown, down, from, the, boiler, periodically, higher, steam, pressures, required, more, blowing, down, of, water, out, of, the, boiler, oxygen, generated, by, boiling, water, attacks, the, boiler, and, with, increased, steam, pressure, the, rate, of, rust, iron, oxide, generated, inside, the, boiler, increases, one, way, to, help, overcome, the, problem, was, water, treatment, swengel, suggested, that, these, problems, contributed, to, the, interest, in, electrification, of, railways, in, the, 1970s, l, d, porta, developed, a, sophisticated, system, of, heavy, duty, chemical, water, treatment, porta, treatment, that, not, only, keeps, the, inside, of, the, boiler, clean, and, prevents, corrosion, but, modifies, the, foam, in, such, a, way, as, to, form, a, compact, blanket, on, the, water, surface, that, filters, the, steam, as, it, is, produced, keeping, it, pure, and, preventing, carry, over, into, the, cylinders, of, water, and, suspended, abrasive, matter, some, steam, locomotives, have, been, run, on, alternative, fuels, such, as, used, cooking, oil, like, grand, canyon, railway, 4960, grand, canyon, railway, 29, u, s, sugar, 148, and, the, disneyland, railroad, locomotives, a, steam, locomotive, is, normally, controlled, from, the, boiler, s, backhead, and, the, crew, is, usually, protected, from, the, elements, by, a, cab, a, crew, of, at, least, two, people, is, normally, required, to, operate, a, steam, locomotive, one, the, train, driver, or, engineer, north, america, is, responsible, for, controlling, the, locomotive, s, starting, stopping, and, speed, and, the, fireman, is, responsible, for, maintaining, the, fire, regulating, steam, pressure, and, monitoring, boiler, and, tender, water, levels, due, to, the, historical, loss, of, operational, infrastructure, and, staffing, preserved, steam, locomotives, operating, on, the, mainline, will, often, have, a, support, crew, travelling, with, the, train, all, locomotives, are, fitted, with, a, variety, of, appliances, some, of, these, relate, directly, to, the, operation, of, the, steam, engine, others, are, for, signalling, train, control, or, other, purposes, in, the, united, states, the, federal, railroad, administration, mandated, the, use, of, certain, appliances, over, the, years, in, response, to, safety, concerns, the, most, typical, appliances, are, as, follows, water, feedwater, must, be, delivered, to, the, boiler, to, replace, that, which, is, exhausted, as, steam, after, delivering, a, working, stroke, to, the, pistons, as, the, boiler, is, under, pressure, during, operation, feedwater, must, be, forced, into, the, boiler, at, a, pressure, that, is, greater, than, the, steam, pressure, necessitating, the, use, of, some, sort, of, pump, hand, operated, pumps, sufficed, for, the, very, earliest, locomotives, later, engines, used, pumps, driven, by, the, motion, of, the, pistons, axle, pumps, which, were, simple, to, operate, reliable, and, could, handle, large, quantities, of, water, but, only, operated, when, the, locomotive, was, moving, and, could, overload, the, valve, gear, and, piston, rods, at, high, speeds, steam, injectors, later, replaced, the, pump, while, some, engines, transitioned, to, turbopumps, standard, practice, evolved, to, use, two, independent, systems, for, feeding, water, to, the, boiler, either, two, steam, injectors, or, on, more, conservative, designs, axle, pumps, when, running, at, service, speed, and, a, steam, injector, for, filling, the, boiler, when, stationary, or, at, low, speeds, by, the, 20th, century, virtually, all, new, built, locomotives, used, only, steam, injectors, often, one, injector, was, supplied, with, live, steam, straight, from, the, boiler, itself, and, the, other, used, exhaust, steam, from, the, locomotive, s, cylinders, which, was, more, efficient, since, it, made, use, of, otherwise, wasted, steam, but, could, only, be, used, when, the, locomotive, was, in, motion, and, the, regulator, was, open, injectors, became, unreliable, if, the, feedwater, was, at, a, high, temperature, so, locomotives, with, feedwater, heaters, tank, locomotives, with, the, tanks, in, contact, with, the, boiler, and, condensing, locomotives, sometimes, used, reciprocating, steam, pumps, or, turbopumps, vertical, glass, tubes, known, as, water, gauges, or, water, glasses, show, the, level, of, water, in, the, boiler, and, are, carefully, monitored, at, all, times, while, the, boiler, is, being, fired, before, the, 1870s, it, was, more, common, to, have, a, series, of, try, cocks, fitted, to, the, boiler, within, reach, of, the, crew, each, try, cock, at, least, two, and, usually, three, were, fitted, was, mounted, at, a, different, level, by, opening, each, try, cock, and, seeing, if, steam, or, water, vented, through, it, the, level, of, water, in, the, boiler, could, be, estimated, with, limited, accuracy, as, boiler, pressures, increased, the, use, of, try, cocks, became, increasingly, dangerous, and, the, valves, were, prone, to, blockage, with, scale, or, sediment, giving, false, readings, this, led, to, their, replacement, with, the, sight, glass, as, with, the, injectors, two, glasses, with, separate, fittings, were, usually, installed, to, provide, independent, readings, the, term, for, pipe, and, boiler, insulation, is, lagging, which, derives, from, the, cooper, s, term, for, a, wooden, barrel, stave, two, of, the, earliest, steam, locomotives, used, wooden, lagging, to, insulate, their, boilers, the, salamanca, the, first, commercially, successful, steam, locomotive, built, in, 1812, and, the, locomotion, no, 1, the, first, steam, locomotive, to, carry, passengers, on, a, public, rail, line, large, amounts, of, heat, are, wasted, if, a, boiler, is, not, insulated, early, locomotives, used, lags, shaped, wooden, staves, fitted, lengthways, along, the, boiler, barrel, and, held, in, place, by, hoops, metal, bands, the, terms, and, methods, are, from, cooperage, improved, insulating, methods, included, applying, a, thick, paste, containing, a, porous, mineral, such, as, kieselgur, or, attaching, shaped, blocks, of, insulating, compound, such, as, magnesia, blocks, in, the, latter, days, of, steam, mattresses, of, stitched, asbestos, cloth, stuffed, with, asbestos, fibre, were, fixed, to, the, boiler, on, separators, so, as, not, quite, to, touch, the, boiler, however, asbestos, is, currently, banned, in, most, countries, for, health, reasons, the, most, common, modern, day, material, is, glass, wool, or, wrappings, of, aluminium, foil, the, lagging, is, protected, by, a, close, fitted, sheet, metal, casing, known, as, boiler, clothing, or, cleading, effective, lagging, is, particularly, important, for, fireless, locomotives, however, in, recent, times, under, the, influence, of, l, d, porta, exaggerated, insulation, has, been, practised, for, all, types, of, locomotive, on, all, surfaces, liable, to, dissipate, heat, such, as, cylinder, ends, and, facings, between, the, cylinders, and, the, mainframes, this, considerably, reduces, engine, warmup, time, with, a, marked, increase, in, overall, efficiency, early, locomotives, were, fitted, with, a, valve, controlled, by, a, weight, suspended, from, the, end, of, a, lever, with, the, steam, outlet, being, stopped, by, a, cone, shaped, valve, as, there, was, nothing, to, prevent, the, weighted, lever, from, bouncing, when, the, locomotive, ran, over, irregularities, in, the, track, thus, wasting, steam, the, weight, was, later, replaced, by, a, more, stable, spring, loaded, column, often, supplied, by, salter, a, well, known, spring, scale, manufacturer, the, danger, of, these, devices, was, that, the, driving, crew, could, be, tempted, to, add, weight, to, the, arm, to, increase, pressure, most, early, boilers, were, fitted, with, a, tamper, proof, lockup, direct, loaded, ball, valve, protected, by, a, cowl, in, the, late, 1850s, john, ramsbottom, introduced, a, safety, valve, that, became, popular, in, britain, during, the, latter, part, of, the, 19th, century, not, only, was, this, valve, tamper, proof, but, tampering, by, the, driver, could, only, have, the, effect, of, easing, pressure, george, richardson, s, safety, valve, was, an, american, invention, introduced, in, 1875, and, was, designed, to, release, the, steam, only, at, the, moment, when, the, pressure, attained, the, maximum, permitted, this, type, of, valve, is, in, almost, universal, use, at, present, britain, s, great, western, railway, was, a, notable, exception, to, this, rule, retaining, the, direct, loaded, type, until, the, end, of, its, separate, existence, because, it, was, considered, that, such, a, valve, lost, less, pressure, between, opening, and, closing, the, earliest, locomotives, did, not, show, the, pressure, of, steam, in, the, boiler, but, it, was, possible, to, estimate, this, by, the, position, of, the, safety, valve, arm, which, often, extended, onto, the, firebox, back, plate, gradations, marked, on, the, spring, column, gave, a, rough, indication, of, the, actual, pressure, the, promoters, of, the, rainhill, trials, urged, that, each, contender, have, a, proper, mechanism, for, reading, the, boiler, pressure, and, stephenson, devised, a, nine, foot, vertical, tube, of, mercury, with, a, sight, glass, at, the, top, mounted, alongside, the, chimney, for, his, rocket, the, bourdon, tube, gauge, in, which, the, pressure, straightens, an, oval, section, coiled, tube, of, brass, or, bronze, connected, to, a, pointer, was, introduced, in, 1849, and, quickly, gained, acceptance, and, is, still, used, today, some, locomotives, have, an, additional, pressure, gauge, in, the, steam, chest, this, helps, the, driver, avoid, wheel, slip, at, startup, by, warning, if, the, regulator, opening, is, too, great, wood, burners, emit, large, quantities, of, flying, sparks, which, necessitate, an, efficient, spark, arresting, device, generally, housed, in, the, smokestack, many, different, types, were, fitted, the, most, common, early, type, being, the, bonnet, stack, that, incorporated, a, cone, shaped, deflector, placed, before, the, mouth, of, the, chimney, pipe, and, a, wire, screen, covering, the, wide, stack, exit, a, more, efficient, design, was, the, radley, and, hunter, centrifugal, stack, patented, in, 1850, commonly, known, as, the, diamond, stack, incorporating, baffles, so, oriented, as, to, induce, a, swirl, effect, in, the, chamber, that, encouraged, the, embers, to, burn, out, and, fall, to, the, bottom, as, ash, in, the, self, cleaning, smokebox, the, opposite, effect, was, achieved, by, allowing, the, flue, gasses, to, strike, a, series, of, deflector, plates, angled, in, such, a, way, that, the, blast, was, not, impaired, the, larger, particles, were, broken, into, small, pieces, that, would, be, ejected, with, the, blast, rather, than, settle, in, the, bottom, of, the, smokebox, to, be, removed, by, hand, at, the, end, of, the, run, as, with, the, arrestor, a, screen, was, incorporated, to, retain, any, large, embers, locomotives, of, the, british, railways, standard, classes, fitted, with, self, cleaning, smokeboxes, were, identified, by, a, small, cast, oval, plate, marked, s, c, fitted, at, the, bottom, of, the, smokebox, door, these, engines, required, different, disposal, procedures, and, the, plate, highlighted, this, need, to, depot, staff, a, factor, that, limits, locomotive, performance, is, the, rate, at, which, fuel, is, fed, into, the, fire, in, the, early, 20th, century, some, locomotives, became, so, large, that, the, fireman, could, not, shovel, coal, fast, enough, in, the, united, states, various, steam, powered, mechanical, stokers, became, standard, equipment, and, were, adopted, and, used, elsewhere, including, australia, and, south, africa, introducing, cold, water, into, a, boiler, reduces, power, and, from, the, 1920s, a, variety, of, heaters, were, incorporated, the, most, common, type, for, locomotives, was, the, exhaust, steam, feedwater, heater, that, piped, some, of, the, exhaust, through, small, tanks, mounted, on, top, of, the, boiler, or, smokebox, or, into, the, tender, tank, the, warm, water, then, had, to, be, delivered, to, the, boiler, by, a, small, auxiliary, steam, pump, the, rare, economiser, type, differed, in, that, it, extracted, residual, heat, from, the, exhaust, gases, an, example, of, this, is, the, pre, heater, drum, s, found, on, the, franco, crosti, boiler, the, use, of, live, steam, and, exhaust, steam, injectors, also, assists, in, the, pre, heating, of, boiler, feedwater, to, a, small, degree, though, there, is, no, efficiency, advantage, to, live, steam, injectors, such, pre, heating, also, reduces, the, thermal, shock, that, a, boiler, might, experience, when, cold, water, is, introduced, directly, this, is, further, helped, by, the, top, feed, where, water, is, introduced, to, the, highest, part, of, the, boiler, and, made, to, trickle, over, a, series, of, trays, george, jackson, churchward, fitted, this, arrangement, to, the, high, end, of, his, domeless, coned, boilers, other, british, lines, such, as, the, london, brighton, south, coast, railway, fitted, some, locomotives, with, the, top, feed, inside, a, separate, dome, forward, of, the, main, one, steam, locomotives, consume, vast, quantities, of, water, because, they, operate, on, an, open, cycle, expelling, their, steam, immediately, after, a, single, use, rather, than, recycling, it, in, a, closed, loop, as, stationary, and, marine, steam, engines, do, water, was, a, constant, logistical, problem, and, condensing, engines, were, devised, for, use, in, desert, areas, these, engines, had, huge, radiators, in, their, tenders, and, instead, of, exhausting, steam, out, of, the, funnel, it, was, captured, passed, back, to, the, tender, and, condensed, the, cylinder, lubricating, oil, was, removed, from, the, exhausted, steam, to, avoid, a, phenomenon, known, as, priming, a, condition, caused, by, foaming, in, the, boiler, which, would, allow, water, to, be, carried, into, the, cylinders, causing, damage, because, of, its, incompressibility, the, most, notable, engines, employing, condensers, class, 25, the, puffers, which, never, puff, worked, across, the, karoo, desert, of, south, africa, from, the, 1950s, until, the, 1980s, some, british, and, american, locomotives, were, equipped, with, scoops, which, collected, water, from, water, troughs, track, pans, in, the, us, while, in, motion, thus, avoiding, stops, for, water, in, the, us, small, communities, often, did, not, have, refilling, facilities, during, the, early, days, of, railroading, the, crew, simply, stopped, next, to, a, stream, and, filled, the, tender, using, leather, buckets, this, was, known, as, jerking, water, and, led, to, the, term, jerkwater, towns, meaning, a, small, town, a, term, which, today, is, considered, derisive, in, australia, and, south, africa, locomotives, in, drier, regions, operated, with, large, oversized, tenders, and, some, even, had, an, additional, water, wagon, sometimes, called, a, canteen, or, in, australia, particularly, in, new, south, wales, a, water, gin, steam, locomotives, working, on, underground, railways, such, as, london, s, metropolitan, railway, were, fitted, with, condensing, apparatus, to, prevent, steam, from, escaping, into, the, railway, tunnels, these, were, still, being, used, between, king, s, cross, and, moorgate, into, the, early, 1960s, steam, locomotives, usually, have, their, own, braking, system, independent, from, the, rest, of, the, train, locomotive, brakes, employ, large, shoes, which, press, against, the, driving, wheel, treads, they, can, be, either, air, brakes, or, steam, brakes, in, addition, they, nearly, always, have, a, handbrake, to, keep, the, locomotive, stationary, when, there, is, no, steam, pressure, to, power, the, other, braking, systems, because, of, the, limited, braking, force, provided, by, locomotive, only, brakes, many, steam, locomotives, were, fitted, with, a, train, brake, these, came, in, two, main, varieties, air, brakes, and, vacuum, brakes, these, allowed, the, driver, to, control, the, brakes, on, all, cars, in, the, train, air, brakes, invented, by, george, westinghouse, use, a, steam, driven, air, compressor, mounted, on, the, side, of, the, boiler, to, create, the, compressed, air, needed, to, power, the, brake, system, air, brakes, were, the, predominant, form, of, train, braking, in, most, countries, during, the, steam, era, the, primary, competitor, to, the, air, brake, was, the, vacuum, brake, in, which, a, steam, operated, ejector, is, mounted, on, the, engine, instead, of, the, air, pump, to, create, the, vacuum, required, to, power, the, brake, system, a, secondary, ejector, or, crosshead, vacuum, pump, is, used, to, maintain, the, vacuum, in, the, system, against, the, small, leaks, in, the, pipe, connections, between, carriages, and, wagons, vacuum, brakes, were, the, predominant, form, of, train, braking, in, the, united, kingdom, and, countries, that, adopted, its, practices, such, as, india, and, south, africa, during, the, steam, era, steam, locomotives, are, fitted, with, sandboxes, from, which, sand, can, be, deposited, on, top, of, the, rail, to, improve, traction, and, braking, in, wet, or, icy, weather, on, american, locomotives, the, sandboxes, or, sand, domes, are, usually, mounted, on, top, of, the, boiler, in, britain, the, limited, loading, gauge, precludes, this, so, the, sandboxes, are, mounted, just, above, or, just, below, the, running, plate, the, pistons, and, valves, on, the, earliest, locomotives, were, lubricated, by, the, enginemen, dropping, a, lump, of, tallow, down, the, blast, pipe, more, sophisticated, methods, of, delivering, the, substance, were, soon, developed, tallow, adheres, well, to, cylinder, walls, and, is, more, effective, than, mineral, oil, in, resisting, the, action, of, water, it, remains, a, constituent, of, modern, steam, cylinder, oil, formulation, as, speeds, and, distances, increased, mechanisms, were, developed, that, injected, thick, mineral, oil, into, the, steam, supply, the, first, a, displacement, lubricator, mounted, in, the, cab, uses, a, controlled, stream, of, steam, condensing, into, a, sealed, container, of, oil, water, from, the, condensed, steam, displaces, the, oil, into, pipes, the, apparatus, is, usually, fitted, with, sight, glasses, to, confirm, the, rate, of, supply, a, later, method, uses, a, mechanical, pump, worked, from, one, of, the, crossheads, in, both, cases, the, supply, of, oil, is, proportional, to, the, speed, of, the, locomotive, lubricating, the, frame, components, axle, bearings, horn, blocks, and, bogie, pivots, depends, on, capillary, action, trimmings, of, worsted, yarn, are, trailed, from, oil, reservoirs, into, pipes, leading, to, the, respective, component, the, rate, of, oil, supplied, is, controlled, by, the, size, of, the, bundle, of, yarn, and, not, the, speed, of, the, locomotive, so, it, is, necessary, to, remove, the, trimmings, which, are, mounted, on, wire, when, stationary, however, at, regular, stops, such, as, a, terminating, station, platform, oil, finding, its, way, onto, the, track, can, still, be, a, problem, crankpin, and, crosshead, bearings, carry, small, cup, shaped, reservoirs, for, oil, these, have, feed, pipes, to, the, bearing, surface, that, start, above, the, normal, fill, level, or, are, kept, closed, by, a, loose, fitting, pin, so, that, only, when, the, locomotive, is, in, motion, does, oil, enter, in, united, kingdom, practice, the, cups, are, closed, with, simple, corks, but, these, have, a, piece, of, porous, cane, pushed, through, them, to, admit, air, it, is, customary, for, a, small, capsule, of, pungent, oil, aniseed, or, garlic, to, be, incorporated, in, the, bearing, metal, to, warn, if, the, lubrication, fails, and, excess, heating, or, wear, occurs, when, the, locomotive, is, running, under, power, a, draught, on, the, fire, is, created, by, the, exhaust, steam, directed, up, the, chimney, by, the, blastpipe, without, draught, the, fire, will, quickly, die, down, and, steam, pressure, will, fall, when, the, locomotive, is, stopped, or, coasting, with, the, regulator, closed, there, is, no, exhaust, steam, to, create, a, draught, so, the, draught, is, maintained, by, means, of, a, blower, this, is, a, ring, placed, either, around, the, base, of, the, chimney, or, around, the, blast, pipe, orifice, containing, several, small, steam, nozzles, directed, up, the, chimney, these, nozzles, are, fed, with, steam, directly, from, the, boiler, controlled, by, the, blower, valve, when, the, regulator, is, open, the, blower, valve, is, closed, when, the, driver, intends, to, close, the, regulator, he, will, first, open, the, blower, valve, it, is, important, that, the, blower, be, opened, before, the, regulator, is, closed, since, without, draught, on, the, fire, there, may, be, backdraught, where, atmospheric, air, blows, down, the, chimney, causing, the, flow, of, hot, gases, through, the, boiler, tubes, to, be, reversed, with, the, fire, itself, being, blown, through, the, firehole, onto, the, footplate, with, serious, consequences, for, the, crew, the, risk, of, backdraught, is, higher, when, the, locomotive, enters, a, tunnel, because, of, the, pressure, shock, the, blower, is, also, used, to, create, draught, when, steam, is, being, raised, at, the, start, of, the, locomotive, s, duty, at, any, time, when, the, driver, needs, to, increase, the, draught, on, the, fire, and, to, clear, smoke, from, the, driver, s, line, of, vision, blowbacks, were, fairly, common, in, a, 1955, report, on, an, accident, near, dunstable, the, inspector, wrote, in, 1953, twenty, three, cases, which, were, not, caused, by, an, engine, defect, were, reported, and, they, resulted, in, 26, enginemen, receiving, injuries, in, 1954, the, number, of, occurrences, and, of, injuries, were, the, same, and, there, was, also, one, fatal, casualty, they, remain, a, problem, as, evidenced, by, the, 2012, incident, with, br, standard, class, 7, 70013, oliver, cromwell, in, british, and, european, except, former, soviet, union, countries, practice, locomotives, usually, have, buffers, at, each, end, to, absorb, compressive, loads, buffets, the, tensional, load, of, drawing, the, train, draft, force, is, carried, by, the, coupling, system, together, these, control, slack, between, the, locomotive, and, train, absorb, minor, impacts, and, provide, a, bearing, point, for, pushing, movements, in, canadian, and, american, practice, all, of, the, forces, between, the, locomotive, and, cars, are, handled, through, the, coupler, particularly, the, janney, coupler, long, standard, on, american, railroad, rolling, stock, and, its, associated, draft, gear, which, allows, some, limited, slack, movement, small, dimples, called, poling, pockets, at, the, front, and, rear, corners, of, the, locomotive, allowed, cars, to, be, pushed, onto, an, adjacent, track, using, a, pole, braced, between, the, locomotive, and, the, cars, in, britain, and, europe, north, american, style, buckeye, and, other, couplers, that, handle, forces, between, items, of, rolling, stock, have, become, increasingly, popular, a, pilot, was, usually, fixed, to, the, front, end, of, locomotives, although, in, european, and, a, few, other, railway, systems, including, new, south, wales, they, were, considered, unnecessary, plough, shaped, sometimes, called, cow, catchers, they, were, quite, large, and, were, designed, to, remove, obstacles, from, the, track, such, as, cattle, bison, other, animals, or, tree, limbs, though, unable, to, catch, stray, cattle, these, distinctive, items, remained, on, locomotives, until, the, end, of, steam, switching, engines, usually, replaced, the, pilot, with, small, steps, known, as, footboards, many, systems, used, the, pilot, and, other, design, features, to, produce, a, distinctive, appearance, when, night, operations, began, railway, companies, in, some, countries, equipped, their, locomotives, with, lights, to, allow, the, driver, to, see, what, lay, ahead, of, the, train, or, to, enable, others, to, see, the, locomotive, headlights, were, originally, oil, or, acetylene, lamps, but, when, electric, arc, lamps, became, available, in, the, late, 1880s, they, quickly, replaced, the, older, types, britain, did, not, adopt, bright, headlights, as, they, would, affect, night, vision, and, so, could, mask, the, low, intensity, oil, lamps, used, in, the, semaphore, signals, and, at, each, end, of, trains, increasing, the, danger, of, missing, signals, especially, on, busy, tracks, locomotive, stopping, distances, were, also, normally, much, greater, than, the, range, of, headlights, and, the, railways, were, well, signalled, and, fully, fenced, to, prevent, livestock, and, people, from, straying, onto, them, largely, negating, the, need, for, bright, lamps, thus, low, intensity, oil, lamps, continued, to, be, used, positioned, on, the, front, of, locomotives, to, indicate, the, class, of, each, train, four, lamp, irons, brackets, on, which, to, place, the, lamps, were, provided, one, below, the, chimney, and, three, evenly, spaced, across, the, top, of, the, buffer, beam, the, exception, to, this, was, the, southern, railway, and, its, constituents, who, added, an, extra, lamp, iron, each, side, of, the, smokebox, and, the, arrangement, of, lamps, or, in, daylight, white, circular, plates, told, railway, staff, the, origin, and, destination, of, the, train, on, all, vehicles, equivalent, lamp, irons, were, also, provided, on, the, rear, of, the, locomotive, or, tender, for, when, the, locomotive, was, running, tender, or, bunker, first, in, some, countries, heritage, steam, operation, continues, on, the, national, network, some, railway, authorities, have, mandated, powerful, headlights, on, at, all, times, including, during, daylight, this, was, to, further, inform, the, public, or, track, workers, of, any, active, trains, locomotives, used, bells, and, steam, whistles, from, earliest, days, of, steam, locomotion, in, the, united, states, india, and, canada, bells, warned, of, a, train, in, motion, in, britain, where, all, lines, are, by, law, fenced, throughout, bells, were, only, a, requirement, on, railways, running, on, a, road, i, e, not, fenced, off, for, example, a, tramway, along, the, side, of, the, road, or, in, a, dockyard, consequently, only, a, minority, of, locomotives, in, the, uk, carried, bells, whistles, are, used, to, signal, personnel, and, give, warnings, depending, on, the, terrain, the, locomotive, was, being, used, in, the, whistle, could, be, designed, for, long, distance, warning, of, impending, arrival, or, for, more, localised, use, early, bells, and, whistles, were, sounded, through, pull, string, cords, and, levers, automatic, bell, ringers, came, into, widespread, use, in, the, us, after, 1910, from, the, early, 20th, century, operating, companies, in, such, countries, as, germany, and, britain, began, to, fit, locomotives, with, automatic, warning, system, aws, in, cab, signalling, which, automatically, applied, the, brakes, when, a, signal, was, passed, at, caution, in, britain, these, became, mandatory, in, 1956, in, the, united, states, the, pennsylvania, railroad, also, fitted, their, locomotives, with, such, devices, the, booster, engine, was, an, auxiliary, steam, engine, which, provided, extra, tractive, effort, for, starting, it, was, a, low, speed, device, usually, mounted, on, the, trailing, truck, it, was, disengaged, via, an, idler, gear, at, a, low, speed, e, g, 30, km, h, boosters, were, widely, used, in, the, us, and, tried, experimentally, in, britain, and, france, on, the, narrow, gauged, new, zealand, railway, system, six, kb, 4, 8, 4, locomotives, were, fitted, with, boosters, the, only, 3, ft, 6, in, 1, 067, mm, gauge, engines, in, the, world, to, have, such, equipment, booster, engines, were, also, fitted, to, tender, trucks, in, the, us, and, known, as, auxiliary, locomotives, two, and, even, three, truck, axles, were, connected, together, using, side, rods, which, limited, them, to, slow, speed, service, the, firedoor, is, used, to, cover, the, firehole, when, coal, is, not, being, added, it, serves, two, purposes, first, it, prevents, air, being, drawn, over, the, top, of, the, fire, rather, forcing, it, to, be, drawn, through, it, the, second, purpose, is, to, safeguard, the, train, crew, against, blowbacks, it, does, however, have, a, means, to, allow, some, air, to, pass, over, the, top, of, the, fire, referred, to, as, secondary, air, to, complete, the, combustion, of, gases, produced, by, the, fire, firedoors, come, in, multiple, designs, the, most, basic, of, which, is, a, single, piece, which, is, hinged, on, one, side, and, can, swing, open, onto, the, footplate, this, design, has, two, issues, first, it, takes, up, much, room, on, the, footplate, and, second, the, draught, will, tend, to, pull, it, completely, shut, thus, cutting, off, any, secondary, air, to, compensate, for, this, some, locomotives, are, fitted, with, a, latch, that, prevents, the, firedoor, from, closing, completely, whereas, others, have, a, small, vent, on, the, door, that, may, be, opened, to, allow, secondary, air, to, flow, through, though, it, was, considered, to, design, a, firedoor, that, opens, inwards, into, the, firebox, thus, preventing, the, inconvenience, caused, on, the, footplate, such, a, door, would, be, exposed, to, the, full, heat, of, the, fire, and, would, likely, deform, thus, becoming, useless, a, more, popular, type, of, firedoor, consists, of, a, two, piece, sliding, door, operated, by, a, single, lever, there, are, tracks, above, and, below, the, firedoor, which, the, door, runs, along, these, tracks, are, prone, to, becoming, jammed, by, debris, and, the, doors, required, more, effort, to, open, than, the, aforementioned, swinging, door, in, order, to, address, this, some, firedoors, use, powered, operation, which, utilized, a, steam, or, air, cylinder, to, open, the, door, among, these, are, the, butterfly, doors, which, pivot, at, the, upper, corner, the, pivoting, action, offers, low, resistance, to, the, cylinder, that, opens, the, door, numerous, variations, on, the, basic, locomotive, occurred, as, railways, attempted, to, improve, efficiency, and, performance, early, steam, locomotives, had, two, cylinders, one, either, side, and, this, practice, persisted, as, the, simplest, arrangement, the, cylinders, could, be, mounted, between, the, mainframes, known, as, inside, cylinders, or, mounted, outside, the, frames, and, driving, wheels, outside, cylinders, inside, cylinders, drive, cranks, built, into, the, driving, axle, outside, cylinders, drive, cranks, on, extensions, to, the, driving, axles, later, designs, employed, three, or, four, cylinders, mounted, both, inside, and, outside, the, frames, for, a, more, even, power, cycle, and, greater, power, output, this, was, at, the, expense, of, more, complicated, valve, gear, and, increased, maintenance, requirements, in, some, cases, the, third, cylinder, was, added, inside, simply, to, allow, for, smaller, diameter, outside, cylinders, and, hence, reduce, the, width, of, the, locomotive, for, use, on, lines, with, a, restricted, loading, gauge, for, example, the, sr, k1, and, u1, classes, most, british, express, passenger, locomotives, built, between, 1930, and, 1950, were, 4, 6, 0, or, 4, 6, 2, types, with, three, or, four, cylinders, e, g, gwr, 6000, class, lms, coronation, class, sr, merchant, navy, class, lner, gresley, class, a3, from, 1951, all, but, one, of, the, 999, new, british, rail, standard, class, steam, locomotives, across, all, types, used, 2, cylinder, configurations, for, easier, maintenance, early, locomotives, used, a, simple, valve, gear, that, gave, full, power, in, either, forward, or, reverse, soon, the, stephenson, valve, gear, allowed, the, driver, to, control, cut, off, this, was, largely, superseded, by, walschaerts, valve, gear, and, similar, patterns, early, locomotive, designs, using, slide, valves, and, outside, admission, were, relatively, easy, to, construct, but, inefficient, and, prone, to, wear, eventually, slide, valves, were, superseded, by, inside, admission, piston, valves, though, there, were, attempts, to, apply, poppet, valves, commonly, used, in, stationary, engines, in, the, 20th, century, stephenson, valve, gear, was, generally, placed, within, the, frame, and, was, difficult, to, access, for, maintenance, later, patterns, applied, outside, the, frame, were, more, readily, visible, and, maintained, compound, locomotives, were, used, from, 1876, expanding, the, steam, twice, or, more, through, separate, cylinders, reducing, thermal, losses, caused, by, cylinder, cooling, compound, locomotives, were, especially, useful, in, trains, where, long, periods, of, continuous, efforts, were, needed, compounding, contributed, to, the, dramatic, increase, in, power, achieved, by, andr, chapelon, s, rebuilds, from, 1929, a, common, application, was, in, articulated, locomotives, the, most, common, being, that, designed, by, anatole, mallet, in, which, the, high, pressure, stage, was, attached, directly, to, the, boiler, frame, in, front, of, this, was, pivoted, a, low, pressure, engine, on, its, own, frame, which, takes, the, exhaust, from, the, rear, engine, very, powerful, locomotives, tend, to, be, longer, than, those, with, lower, power, output, but, long, rigid, framed, designs, are, impracticable, for, the, tight, curves, frequently, found, on, narrow, gauge, railways, various, designs, for, articulated, locomotives, were, developed, to, overcome, this, problem, the, mallet, and, the, garratt, were, the, two, most, popular, they, had, a, single, boiler, and, two, engine, units, sets, of, cylinders, and, driving, wheels, both, of, the, garratt, s, engine, units, were, on, swivelling, frames, whereas, one, of, the, mallet, s, was, on, a, swivelling, frame, and, the, other, was, fixed, under, the, boiler, unit, a, few, triplex, locomotives, were, also, designed, with, a, third, engine, unit, under, the, tender, other, less, common, variations, included, the, fairlie, locomotive, which, had, two, boilers, back, to, back, on, a, common, frame, with, two, separate, engine, units, duplex, locomotives, containing, two, engines, in, one, rigid, frame, were, also, tried, but, were, not, notably, successful, for, example, the, 4, 4, 4, 4, pennsylvania, railroad, class, t1, designed, for, very, fast, running, suffered, recurring, and, ultimately, unfixable, slippage, problems, throughout, their, careers, for, locomotives, where, a, high, starting, torque, and, low, speed, were, required, the, conventional, direct, drive, approach, was, inadequate, geared, steam, locomotives, such, as, the, shay, the, climax, and, the, heisler, were, developed, to, meet, this, need, on, industrial, logging, mine, and, quarry, railways, the, common, feature, of, these, three, types, was, the, provision, of, reduction, gearing, and, a, drive, shaft, between, the, crankshaft, and, the, driving, axles, this, arrangement, allowed, the, engine, to, run, at, a, much, higher, speed, than, the, driving, wheels, compared, to, the, conventional, design, where, the, ratio, is, 1, 1, in, the, united, states, on, the, southern, pacific, railroad, a, series, of, cab, forward, locomotives, were, produced, with, the, cab, and, the, firebox, at, the, front, of, the, locomotive, and, the, tender, behind, the, smokebox, so, that, the, engine, appeared, to, run, backwards, this, was, only, possible, by, using, oil, firing, southern, pacific, selected, this, design, to, provide, air, free, of, smoke, for, the, engine, driver, to, breathe, as, the, locomotive, passed, through, mountain, tunnels, and, snow, sheds, another, variation, was, the, camelback, locomotive, with, the, cab, situated, halfway, along, the, boiler, in, england, oliver, bulleid, developed, the, sr, leader, class, locomotive, during, the, nationalisation, process, in, the, late, 1940s, the, locomotive, was, heavily, tested, but, several, design, faults, such, as, coal, firing, and, sleeve, valves, meant, that, this, locomotive, and, the, other, part, built, locomotives, were, scrapped, the, cab, forward, design, was, taken, by, bulleid, to, ireland, where, he, moved, after, nationalisation, where, he, developed, the, turfburner, this, locomotive, was, more, successful, but, was, scrapped, due, to, the, dieselisation, of, the, irish, railways, the, only, preserved, cab, forward, locomotive, is, southern, pacific, 4294, in, sacramento, california, in, france, the, three, heilmann, locomotives, were, built, with, a, cab, forward, design, steam, turbines, were, created, as, an, attempt, to, improve, the, operation, and, efficiency, of, steam, locomotives, experiments, with, steam, turbines, using, direct, drive, and, electrical, transmissions, in, various, countries, proved, mostly, unsuccessful, the, london, midland, scottish, railway, built, the, turbomotive, a, largely, successful, attempt, to, prove, the, efficiency, of, steam, turbines, had, it, not, been, for, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, more, may, have, been, built, the, turbomotive, ran, from, 1935, to, 1949, when, it, was, rebuilt, into, a, conventional, locomotive, because, many, parts, required, replacement, an, uneconomical, proposition, for, a, one, off, locomotive, in, the, united, states, union, pacific, chesapeake, ohio, and, norfolk, western, n, w, railways, all, built, turbine, electric, locomotives, the, pennsylvania, railroad, prr, also, built, turbine, locomotives, but, with, a, direct, drive, gearbox, however, all, designs, failed, due, to, dust, vibration, design, flaws, or, inefficiency, at, lower, speeds, the, final, one, remaining, in, service, was, the, n, w, s, retired, in, january, 1958, the, only, truly, successful, design, was, the, tgoj, mt3, used, for, hauling, iron, ore, from, gr, ngesberg, in, sweden, to, the, ports, of, oxel, sund, despite, functioning, correctly, only, three, were, built, two, of, them, are, preserved, in, working, order, in, museums, in, sweden, in, a, fireless, locomotive, the, boiler, is, replaced, by, a, steam, accumulator, which, is, charged, with, steam, actually, water, at, a, temperature, well, above, boiling, point, 100, c, 212, f, from, a, stationary, boiler, fireless, locomotives, were, used, where, there, was, a, high, fire, risk, e, g, oil, refineries, where, cleanliness, was, important, e, g, food, production, plants, or, where, steam, is, readily, available, e, g, paper, mills, and, power, stations, where, steam, is, either, a, by, product, or, is, cheaply, available, the, water, vessel, boiler, is, heavily, insulated, the, same, as, with, a, fired, locomotive, until, all, the, water, has, boiled, away, the, steam, pressure, does, not, drop, except, as, the, temperature, drops, another, class, of, fireless, locomotive, is, a, compressed, air, locomotive, mixed, power, locomotives, utilising, both, steam, and, diesel, propulsion, have, been, produced, in, russia, britain, and, italy, under, unusual, conditions, lack, of, coal, abundant, hydroelectricity, some, locomotives, in, switzerland, were, modified, to, use, electricity, to, heat, the, boiler, making, them, electric, steam, locomotives, a, steam, electric, locomotive, uses, electric, transmission, like, diesel, electric, locomotives, except, that, a, steam, engine, instead, of, a, diesel, engine, is, used, to, drive, a, generator, three, such, locomotives, were, built, by, the, french, engineer, jean, jacques, heilmann, in, the, 1890s, steam, locomotives, are, categorised, by, their, wheel, arrangement, the, two, dominant, systems, for, this, are, the, whyte, notation, and, uic, classification, the, whyte, notation, used, in, most, english, speaking, and, commonwealth, countries, represents, each, set, of, wheels, with, a, number, these, numbers, typically, represented, the, number, of, unpowered, leading, wheels, followed, by, the, number, of, driving, wheels, sometimes, in, several, groups, followed, by, the, number, of, un, powered, trailing, wheels, for, example, a, yard, engine, with, only, 4, driven, wheels, without, any, leading, or, trailing, wheels, would, be, categorised, as, a, 0, 4, 0, wheel, arrangement, a, locomotive, with, a, 4, wheel, leading, truck, followed, by, 6, drive, wheels, and, a, 2, wheel, trailing, truck, would, be, classed, as, a, 4, 6, 2, different, arrangements, were, given, names, which, usually, reflect, the, first, usage, of, the, arrangement, for, instance, the, santa, fe, type, 2, 10, 2, is, so, called, because, the, first, examples, were, built, for, the, atchison, topeka, and, santa, fe, railway, these, names, were, informally, given, and, varied, according, to, region, and, even, politics, the, uic, classification, is, used, mostly, in, european, countries, apart, from, the, united, kingdom, it, designates, consecutive, pairs, of, wheels, informally, axles, with, a, number, for, non, driving, wheels, and, a, capital, letter, for, driving, wheels, a, 1, b, 2, etc, so, a, whyte, 4, 6, 2, designation, would, be, an, equivalent, to, a, 2, c, 1, uic, designation, on, many, railroads, locomotives, were, organised, into, classes, these, broadly, represented, locomotives, which, could, be, substituted, for, each, other, in, service, but, most, commonly, a, class, represented, a, single, design, as, a, rule, classes, were, assigned, some, sort, of, code, generally, based, on, the, wheel, arrangement, classes, also, commonly, acquired, nicknames, such, as, pug, a, small, shunting, locomotive, representing, notable, and, sometimes, uncomplimentary, features, of, the, locomotives, in, the, steam, locomotive, era, two, measures, of, locomotive, performance, were, generally, applied, at, first, locomotives, were, rated, by, tractive, effort, defined, as, the, average, force, developed, during, one, revolution, of, the, driving, wheels, at, the, railhead, this, can, be, roughly, calculated, by, multiplying, the, total, piston, area, by, 85, of, the, boiler, pressure, a, rule, of, thumb, reflecting, the, slightly, lower, pressure, in, the, steam, chest, above, the, cylinder, and, dividing, by, the, ratio, of, the, driver, diameter, over, the, piston, stroke, however, the, precise, formula, is, where, d, is, the, bore, of, the, cylinder, diameter, in, inches, s, is, the, cylinder, stroke, in, inches, p, is, boiler, pressure, in, pounds, per, square, inch, d, is, the, diameter, of, the, driving, wheel, in, inches, and, c, is, a, factor, that, depends, on, the, effective, cut, off, in, the, us, c, is, usually, set, at, 0, 85, but, lower, on, engines, that, have, maximum, cutoff, limited, to, 50, 75, the, tractive, effort, is, only, the, average, force, as, not, all, effort, is, constant, during, the, one, revolution, of, the, drivers, at, some, points, of, the, cycle, only, one, piston, is, exerting, turning, moment, and, at, other, points, both, pistons, are, working, not, all, boilers, deliver, full, power, at, starting, and, the, tractive, effort, also, decreases, as, the, rotating, speed, increases, tractive, effort, is, a, measure, of, the, heaviest, load, a, locomotive, can, start, or, haul, at, very, low, speed, over, the, ruling, grade, in, a, given, territory, however, as, the, pressure, grew, to, run, faster, goods, and, heavier, passenger, trains, tractive, effort, was, seen, to, be, an, inadequate, measure, of, performance, because, it, did, not, take, into, account, speed, therefore, in, the, 20th, century, locomotives, began, to, be, rated, by, power, output, a, variety, of, calculations, and, formulas, were, applied, but, in, general, railways, used, dynamometer, cars, to, measure, tractive, force, at, speed, in, actual, road, testing, british, railway, companies, have, been, reluctant, to, disclose, figures, for, drawbar, horsepower, and, have, usually, relied, on, continuous, tractive, effort, instead, classification, is, indirectly, connected, to, locomotive, performance, given, adequate, proportions, of, the, rest, of, the, locomotive, power, output, is, determined, by, the, size, of, the, fire, and, for, a, bituminous, coal, fuelled, locomotive, this, is, determined, by, the, grate, area, modern, non, compound, locomotives, are, typically, able, to, produce, about, 40, drawbar, horsepower, per, square, foot, of, grate, tractive, force, as, noted, earlier, is, largely, determined, by, the, boiler, pressure, the, cylinder, proportions, and, the, size, of, the, driving, wheels, however, it, is, also, limited, by, the, weight, on, the, driving, wheels, termed, adhesive, weight, which, needs, to, be, at, least, four, times, the, tractive, effort, the, weight, of, the, locomotive, is, roughly, proportional, to, the, power, output, the, number, of, axles, required, is, determined, by, this, weight, divided, by, the, axleload, limit, for, the, trackage, where, the, locomotive, is, to, be, used, the, number, of, driving, wheels, is, derived, from, the, adhesive, weight, in, the, same, manner, leaving, the, remaining, axles, to, be, accounted, for, by, the, leading, and, trailing, bogies, passenger, locomotives, conventionally, had, two, axle, leading, bogies, for, better, guidance, at, speed, on, the, other, hand, the, vast, increase, in, the, size, of, the, grate, and, firebox, in, the, 20th, century, meant, that, a, trailing, bogie, was, called, upon, to, provide, support, in, europe, some, use, was, made, of, several, variants, of, the, bissel, bogie, in, which, the, swivelling, movement, of, a, single, axle, truck, controls, the, lateral, displacement, of, the, front, driving, axle, and, in, one, case, the, second, axle, too, this, was, mostly, applied, to, 8, coupled, express, and, mixed, traffic, locomotives, and, considerably, improved, their, ability, to, negotiate, curves, whilst, restricting, overall, locomotive, wheelbase, and, maximising, adhesion, weight, as, a, rule, shunting, engines, us, switching, engines, omitted, leading, and, trailing, bogies, both, to, maximise, tractive, effort, available, and, to, reduce, wheelbase, speed, was, unimportant, making, the, smallest, engine, and, therefore, smallest, fuel, consumption, for, the, tractive, effort, was, paramount, driving, wheels, were, small, and, usually, supported, the, firebox, as, well, as, the, main, section, of, the, boiler, banking, engines, us, helper, engines, tended, to, follow, the, principles, of, shunting, engines, except, that, the, wheelbase, limitation, did, not, apply, so, banking, engines, tended, to, have, more, driving, wheels, in, the, us, this, process, eventually, resulted, in, the, mallet, type, engine, with, its, many, driven, wheels, and, these, tended, to, acquire, leading, and, then, trailing, bogies, as, guidance, of, the, engine, became, more, of, an, issue, as, locomotive, types, began, to, diverge, in, the, late, 19th, century, freight, engine, designs, at, first, emphasised, tractive, effort, whereas, those, for, passenger, engines, emphasised, speed, over, time, freight, locomotive, size, increased, and, the, overall, number, of, axles, increased, accordingly, the, leading, bogie, was, usually, a, single, axle, but, a, trailing, truck, was, added, to, larger, locomotives, to, support, a, larger, firebox, that, could, no, longer, fit, between, or, above, the, driving, wheels, passenger, locomotives, had, leading, bogies, with, two, axles, fewer, driving, axles, and, very, large, driving, wheels, in, order, to, limit, the, speed, at, which, the, reciprocating, parts, had, to, move, in, the, 1920s, the, focus, in, the, united, states, turned, to, horsepower, epitomised, by, the, super, power, concept, promoted, by, the, lima, locomotive, works, although, tractive, effort, was, still, the, prime, consideration, after, world, war, i, to, the, end, of, steam, goods, trains, were, designed, to, run, faster, while, passenger, locomotives, needed, to, pull, heavier, loads, at, speed, this, was, achieved, by, increasing, the, size, of, grate, and, firebox, without, changes, to, the, rest, of, the, locomotive, requiring, the, addition, of, a, second, axle, to, the, trailing, truck, freight, 2, 8, 2, s, became, 2, 8, 4, s, while, 2, 10, 2, s, became, 2, 10, 4, s, similarly, passenger, 4, 6, 2, s, became, 4, 6, 4, s, in, the, united, states, this, led, to, a, convergence, on, the, dual, purpose, 4, 8, 4, and, the, 4, 6, 6, 4, articulated, configuration, which, was, used, for, both, freight, and, passenger, service, mallet, locomotives, went, through, a, similar, transformation, evolving, from, bank, engines, into, huge, mainline, locomotives, with, much, larger, fireboxes, their, driving, wheels, were, also, increased, in, size, in, order, to, allow, faster, running, the, most, manufactured, single, class, of, steam, locomotive, in, the, world, is, the, 0, 10, 0, russian, locomotive, class, e, steam, locomotive, with, around, 11, 000, produced, both, in, russia, and, other, countries, such, as, czechoslovakia, germany, sweden, hungary, and, poland, the, russian, locomotive, class, o, numbered, 9, 129, locomotives, built, between, 1890, and, 1928, around, 7, 000, units, were, produced, of, the, german, drb, class, 52, 2, 10, 0, kriegslok, in, britain, 863, of, the, gwr, 5700, class, were, built, and, 943, of, the, dx, class, of, the, london, and, north, western, railway, including, 86, engines, built, for, the, lancashire, and, yorkshire, railway, before, the, 1923, grouping, act, production, in, the, uk, was, mixed, the, larger, railway, companies, built, locomotives, in, their, own, workshops, with, the, smaller, ones, and, industrial, concerns, ordering, them, from, outside, builders, a, large, market, for, outside, builders, existed, due, to, the, home, build, policy, exercised, by, the, main, railway, companies, an, example, of, a, pre, grouping, works, was, the, one, at, melton, constable, which, maintained, and, built, some, of, the, locomotives, for, the, midland, and, great, northern, joint, railway, other, works, included, one, at, boston, an, early, gnr, building, and, horwich, works, between, 1923, and, 1947, the, big, four, railway, companies, the, great, western, railway, the, london, midland, scottish, railway, the, london, north, eastern, railway, and, the, southern, railway, all, built, most, of, their, own, locomotives, only, buying, locomotives, from, outside, builders, when, their, own, works, were, fully, occupied, or, as, a, result, of, government, mandated, standardisation, during, wartime, from, 1948, british, railways, br, allowed, the, former, big, four, companies, now, designated, as, regions, to, continue, to, produce, their, own, designs, but, also, created, a, range, of, standard, locomotives, which, supposedly, combined, the, best, features, from, each, region, although, a, policy, of, dieselisation, was, adopted, in, 1955, br, continued, to, build, new, steam, locomotives, until, 1960, with, the, final, engine, being, named, evening, star, some, independent, manufacturers, produced, steam, locomotives, for, a, few, more, years, with, the, last, british, built, industrial, steam, locomotive, being, constructed, by, hunslet, in, 1971, since, then, a, few, specialised, manufacturers, have, continued, to, produce, small, locomotives, for, narrow, gauge, and, miniature, railways, but, as, the, prime, market, for, these, is, the, tourist, and, heritage, railway, sector, the, demand, for, such, locomotives, is, limited, in, november, 2008, a, new, build, main, line, steam, locomotive, 60163, tornado, was, tested, on, uk, mainlines, for, eventual, charter, and, tour, use, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, most, swedish, steam, locomotives, were, manufactured, in, britain, later, however, most, steam, locomotives, were, built, by, local, factories, including, nohab, in, trollh, ttan, and, asj, in, falun, one, of, the, most, successful, types, was, the, class, b, 4, 6, 0, inspired, by, the, prussian, class, p8, many, of, the, swedish, steam, locomotives, were, preserved, during, the, cold, war, in, case, of, war, during, the, 1990s, these, steam, locomotives, were, sold, to, non, profit, associations, or, abroad, which, is, why, the, swedish, class, b, class, s, 2, 6, 4, and, class, e2, 2, 8, 0, locomotives, can, now, be, seen, in, britain, the, netherlands, germany, and, canada, locomotives, for, american, railroads, were, nearly, always, built, in, the, united, states, with, very, few, imports, except, in, the, earliest, days, of, steam, engines, this, was, due, to, the, basic, differences, of, markets, in, the, united, states, which, initially, had, many, small, markets, located, large, distances, apart, in, contrast, to, europe, s, higher, density, of, markets, locomotives, that, were, cheap, and, rugged, and, could, go, large, distances, over, cheaply, built, and, maintained, tracks, were, required, once, the, manufacture, of, engines, was, established, on, a, wide, scale, there, was, very, little, advantage, to, buying, an, engine, from, overseas, that, would, have, to, be, customised, to, fit, the, local, requirements, and, track, conditions, improvements, in, engine, design, of, both, european, and, us, origin, were, incorporated, by, manufacturers, when, they, could, be, justified, in, a, generally, very, conservative, and, slow, changing, market, with, the, notable, exception, of, the, usra, standard, locomotives, built, during, world, war, i, in, the, united, states, steam, locomotive, manufacture, was, always, semi, customised, railroads, ordered, locomotives, tailored, to, their, specific, requirements, though, some, basic, design, features, were, always, present, railroads, developed, some, specific, characteristics, for, example, the, pennsylvania, railroad, and, the, great, northern, railway, had, a, preference, for, the, belpaire, firebox, in, the, united, states, large, scale, manufacturers, constructed, locomotives, for, nearly, all, rail, companies, although, nearly, all, major, railroads, had, shops, capable, of, heavy, repairs, and, some, railroads, for, example, the, norfolk, and, western, railway, and, the, pennsylvania, railroad, which, had, two, erecting, shops, constructed, locomotives, entirely, in, their, own, shops, companies, manufacturing, locomotives, in, the, us, included, baldwin, locomotive, works, american, locomotive, company, alco, and, lima, locomotive, works, altogether, between, 1830, and, 1950, over, 160, 000, steam, locomotives, were, built, in, the, united, states, with, baldwin, accounting, for, the, largest, share, nearly, 70, 000, steam, locomotives, required, regular, and, compared, to, a, diesel, electric, engine, frequent, service, and, overhaul, often, at, government, regulated, intervals, in, europe, and, the, us, alterations, and, upgrades, regularly, occurred, during, overhauls, new, appliances, were, added, unsatisfactory, features, removed, cylinders, improved, or, replaced, almost, any, part, of, the, locomotive, including, boilers, was, replaced, or, upgraded, when, service, or, upgrades, got, too, expensive, the, locomotive, was, traded, off, or, retired, on, the, baltimore, and, ohio, railroad, two, 2, 10, 2, locomotives, were, dismantled, the, boilers, were, placed, onto, two, new, class, t, 4, 8, 2, locomotives, and, the, residual, wheel, machinery, made, into, a, pair, of, class, u, 0, 10, 0, switchers, with, new, boilers, union, pacific, s, fleet, of, 3, cylinder, 4, 10, 2, engines, were, converted, into, two, cylinder, engines, in, 1942, because, of, high, maintenance, problems, in, sydney, clyde, engineering, and, the, eveleigh, railway, workshops, both, built, steam, locomotives, for, the, new, south, wales, government, railways, these, include, the, c38, class, 4, 6, 2, the, first, five, were, built, at, clyde, with, streamlining, the, other, 25, locomotives, were, built, at, eveleigh, 13, and, cardiff, workshops, 12, near, newcastle, in, queensland, steam, locomotives, were, locally, constructed, by, walkers, similarly, the, south, australian, railways, also, manufactured, steam, locomotives, locally, at, islington, railway, workshops, in, adelaide, victorian, railways, constructed, most, of, their, locomotives, at, its, newport, workshops, and, in, bendigo, while, in, the, early, days, locomotives, were, built, at, the, phoenix, foundry, in, ballarat, locomotives, constructed, at, the, newport, shops, ranged, from, the, na, class, 2, 6, 2, t, built, for, the, narrow, gauge, up, to, the, h, class, 4, 8, 4, the, largest, conventional, locomotive, ever, to, operate, in, australia, weighing, 260, tons, however, the, title, of, largest, locomotive, ever, used, in, australia, goes, to, the, 263, ton, new, south, wales, ad60, class, locomotive, 4, 8, 4, 4, 8, 4, garratt, built, by, beyer, peacock, company, in, england, most, steam, locomotives, used, in, western, australia, were, built, in, the, united, kingdom, though, some, examples, were, designed, and, built, locally, at, the, western, australian, government, railways, midland, railway, workshops, the, 10, wagr, s, class, locomotives, introduced, in, 1943, were, the, only, class, of, steam, locomotive, to, be, wholly, conceived, designed, and, built, in, western, australia, while, the, midland, workshops, notably, participated, in, the, australia, wide, construction, program, of, australian, standard, garratts, these, wartime, locomotives, were, built, at, midland, in, western, australia, clyde, engineering, in, new, south, wales, newport, in, victoria, and, islington, in, south, australia, and, saw, varying, degrees, of, service, in, all, australian, states, the, introduction, of, electric, locomotives, around, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, and, later, diesel, electric, locomotives, spelled, the, beginning, of, a, decline, in, the, use, of, steam, locomotives, although, it, was, some, time, before, they, were, phased, out, of, general, use, as, diesel, power, especially, with, electric, transmission, became, more, reliable, in, the, 1930s, it, gained, a, foothold, in, north, america, the, full, transition, away, from, steam, power, in, north, america, took, place, during, the, 1950s, in, continental, europe, large, scale, electrification, had, replaced, steam, power, by, the, 1970s, steam, was, a, familiar, technology, adapted, well, to, local, facilities, and, also, consumed, a, wide, variety, of, fuels, this, led, to, its, continued, use, in, many, countries, until, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, steam, engines, have, considerably, less, thermal, efficiency, than, modern, diesels, requiring, constant, maintenance, and, labour, to, keep, them, operational, water, is, required, at, many, points, throughout, a, rail, network, making, it, a, major, problem, in, desert, areas, as, are, found, in, some, regions, of, the, united, states, australia, and, south, africa, in, places, where, water, is, available, it, may, be, hard, which, can, cause, scale, to, form, composed, mainly, of, calcium, carbonate, magnesium, hydroxide, and, calcium, sulfate, calcium, and, magnesium, carbonates, tend, to, be, deposited, as, off, white, solids, on, the, inside, the, surfaces, of, pipes, and, heat, exchangers, this, precipitation, is, principally, caused, by, thermal, decomposition, of, bicarbonate, ions, but, also, happens, in, cases, where, the, carbonate, ion, is, at, saturation, concentration, the, resulting, build, up, of, scale, restricts, the, flow, of, water, in, pipes, in, boilers, the, deposits, impair, the, flow, of, heat, into, the, water, reducing, the, heating, efficiency, and, allowing, the, metal, boiler, components, to, overheat, the, reciprocating, mechanism, on, the, driving, wheels, of, a, two, cylinder, single, expansion, steam, locomotive, tended, to, pound, the, rails, see, hammer, blow, thus, requiring, more, maintenance, raising, steam, from, coal, took, a, matter, of, hours, and, created, serious, pollution, problems, coal, burning, locomotives, required, fire, cleaning, and, ash, removal, between, turns, of, duty, diesel, or, electric, locomotives, by, comparison, drew, benefit, from, new, custom, built, servicing, facilities, the, smoke, from, steam, locomotives, was, also, deemed, objectionable, the, first, electric, and, diesel, locomotives, were, developed, in, response, to, smoke, abatement, requirements, although, this, did, not, take, into, account, the, high, level, of, less, visible, pollution, in, diesel, exhaust, smoke, especially, when, idling, in, some, countries, however, power, for, electric, locomotives, is, derived, from, steam, generated, in, power, stations, which, are, often, run, by, coal, dramatic, increases, in, the, cost, of, diesel, fuel, prompted, several, initiatives, to, revive, steam, power, however, none, of, these, has, progressed, to, the, point, of, production, and, as, of, the, early, 21st, century, steam, locomotives, operate, only, in, a, few, isolated, regions, of, the, world, and, in, tourist, operations, as, early, as, 1975, railway, enthusiasts, in, the, united, kingdom, began, building, new, steam, locomotives, that, year, trevor, barber, completed, his, 2, ft, 610, mm, gauge, locomotive, trixie, which, ran, on, the, meirion, mill, railway, from, the, 1990s, onwards, the, number, of, new, builds, being, completed, rose, dramatically, with, new, locos, completed, by, the, narrow, gauge, ffestiniog, and, corris, railways, in, wales, the, hunslet, engine, company, was, revived, in, 2005, and, began, building, steam, locomotives, on, a, commercial, basis, a, standard, gauge, lner, peppercorn, pacific, tornado, was, completed, at, hopetown, works, darlington, and, made, its, first, run, on, 1, august, 2008, it, entered, main, line, service, later, in, 2008, as, of, 2009, over, half, a, dozen, projects, to, build, working, replicas, of, extinct, steam, engines, are, going, ahead, in, many, cases, using, existing, parts, from, other, types, to, build, them, examples, include, br, 72010, hengist, br, class, 3mt, no, 82045, br, class, 2mt, no, 84030, brighton, atlantic, beachy, head, the, lms, 5551, the, unknown, warrior, project, gwr, 47xx, 4709, 2999, lady, of, legend, 1014, county, of, glamorgan, and, 6880, betton, grange, projects, these, united, kingdom, based, new, build, projects, are, further, complemented, by, the, new, build, pennsylvania, railroad, 5550, project, in, the, united, states, one, of, the, group, s, goals, is, to, surpass, the, steam, locomotive, speed, record, held, by, the, 4468, mallard, when, the, 5550, is, completed, and, for, the, 5550, to, fill, in, a, huge, gap, in, steam, locomotive, preservation, in, 1980, american, financier, ross, rowland, established, american, coal, enterprises, to, develop, a, modernised, coal, fired, steam, locomotive, his, ace, 3000, concept, attracted, considerable, attention, but, was, never, built, in, 1998, in, his, book, the, red, devil, and, other, tales, from, the, age, of, steam, david, wardale, put, forward, the, concept, of, a, high, speed, high, efficiency, super, class, 5, 4, 6, 0, locomotive, for, future, steam, haulage, of, tour, trains, on, british, main, lines, the, idea, was, formalised, in, 2001, by, the, formation, of, 5at, project, dedicated, to, developing, and, building, the, 5at, advanced, technology, steam, locomotive, but, it, never, received, any, major, railway, backing, locations, where, new, builds, are, taking, place, include, in, 2012, the, coalition, for, sustainable, rail, project, was, started, in, the, us, with, the, goal, of, creating, a, modern, higher, speed, steam, locomotive, incorporating, the, improvements, proposed, by, livio, dante, porta, and, others, and, using, torrefied, biomass, as, solid, fuel, the, fuel, has, been, recently, developed, by, the, university, of, minnesota, in, a, collaboration, between, the, university, s, institute, on, the, environment, ione, and, sustainable, rail, international, sri, an, organisation, set, up, to, explore, the, use, of, steam, traction, in, a, modern, railway, setup, the, group, have, received, the, last, surviving, but, non, running, atsf, 3460, class, steam, locomotive, no, 3463, via, donation, from, its, previous, owner, in, kansas, the, great, overland, station, museum, they, hope, to, use, it, as, a, platform, for, developing, the, world, s, cleanest, most, powerful, passenger, locomotive, capable, of, speeds, up, to, 130, mph, 210, km, h, named, project, 130, it, aims, to, break, the, world, steam, train, speed, record, set, by, lner, class, a4, 4468, mallard, in, the, uk, at, 126, mph, 203, km, h, however, any, demonstration, of, the, project, s, claims, is, yet, to, be, seen, in, germany, a, small, number, of, fireless, steam, locomotives, are, still, working, in, industrial, service, e, g, at, power, stations, where, an, on, site, supply, of, steam, is, readily, available, the, small, town, of, wolsztyn, poland, approximately, 60, kilometres, 37, mi, from, the, historic, city, of, poznan, is, the, last, place, in, the, world, where, one, can, ride, a, regularly, scheduled, passenger, train, pulled, by, steam, power, the, locomotive, shed, at, wolsztyn, is, the, last, of, its, kind, in, the, world, there, are, several, working, locomotives, that, haul, daily, commuter, service, between, wolsztyn, poznan, leszo, and, other, neighboring, cities, one, can, partake, in, footplate, courses, via, the, wolsztyn, experience, there, is, no, place, left, in, the, world, that, still, operates, daily, non, tourist, steam, powered, commuter, passenger, service, other, than, here, at, wolsztyn, there, are, several, polish, built, ol49, class, 2, 6, 2, general, purpose, locomotives, and, one, pt47, class, 2, 8, 2, in, regular, service, each, may, wolsztyn, is, the, site, of, a, steam, locomotive, festival, which, brings, visiting, locomotives, often, well, over, a, dozen, each, year, all, operating, these, operations, are, not, done, for, tourism, or, museum, historical, purposes, this, is, the, last, non, diesel, rail, line, on, the, pkp, polish, state, network, that, has, been, converted, to, diesel, power, the, swiss, company, dampflokomotiv, und, maschinenfabrik, dlm, ag, delivered, eight, steam, locomotives, to, rack, railways, in, switzerland, and, austria, between, 1992, and, 1996, four, of, them, are, now, the, main, traction, on, the, brienz, rothorn, bahn, the, four, others, were, built, for, the, schafbergbahn, in, austria, where, they, run, 90, of, the, trains, the, same, company, also, rebuilt, a, german, dr, class, 52, 80, 2, 10, 0, locomotive, to, new, standards, with, modifications, such, as, roller, bearings, light, oil, firing, and, boiler, insulation, the, future, use, of, steam, locomotives, in, the, united, kingdom, is, in, doubt, because, of, government, policy, on, climate, change, the, heritage, railway, association, is, working, with, the, all, party, parliamentary, group, on, heritage, rail, in, an, effort, to, continue, running, steam, locomotives, on, coal, many, tourist, railroads, use, oil, fired, steam, locomotives, or, have, converted, their, locomotives, to, run, on, oil, to, reduce, their, environmental, footprint, and, because, fuel, oil, can, be, easier, to, obtain, than, coal, of, the, proper, type, and, sizing, for, locomotives, for, example, the, grand, canyon, railway, runs, its, steam, locomotives, on, used, vegetable, oil, an, organization, called, the, coalition, for, sustainable, rail, csr, is, developing, an, environmentally, friendly, coal, substitute, made, from, torrefied, biomass, in, early, 2019, they, performed, a, series, of, tests, using, everett, railroad, to, evaluate, the, performance, of, the, biofuel, with, positive, results, the, biofuel, was, found, to, burn, slightly, faster, and, hotter, than, coal, the, goal, of, the, project, is, primarily, to, find, a, sustainable, fuel, for, historic, steam, locomotives, on, tourist, railroads, but, csr, has, also, suggested, that, in, the, future, steam, locomotives, powered, by, torrefied, biomass, could, be, an, environmentally, and, economically, superior, alternative, to, diesel, locomotives, also, a, large, vat, containing, salt, may, be, used, without, needing, to, replenishing, the, medium, large, heating, elements, would, be, one, method, of, recharging, the, system, however, it, is, possible, to, pump, molten, salt, as, well, removing, the, cooled, salt, and, replenishing, from, facilities, which, contain, a, much, larger, vat, steam, locomotives, have, been,
