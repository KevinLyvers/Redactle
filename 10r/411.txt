a, cotton, gin, meaning, cotton, engine, is, a, machine, that, quickly, and, easily, separates, cotton, fibers, from, their, seeds, enabling, much, greater, productivity, than, manual, cotton, separation, the, separated, seeds, may, be, used, to, grow, more, cotton, or, to, produce, cottonseed, oil, handheld, roller, gins, had, been, used, in, the, indian, subcontinent, since, at, earliest, ad, 500, and, then, in, other, regions, the, indian, worm, gear, roller, gin, was, invented, sometime, around, the, 16th, century, and, has, according, to, lakwete, remained, virtually, unchanged, up, to, the, present, time, a, modern, mechanical, cotton, gin, was, created, by, american, inventor, eli, whitney, in, 1793, and, patented, in, 1794, whitney, s, gin, used, a, combination, of, a, wire, screen, and, small, wire, hooks, to, pull, the, cotton, through, while, brushes, continuously, removed, the, loose, cotton, lint, to, prevent, jams, it, revolutionized, the, cotton, industry, in, the, united, states, but, also, inadvertently, led, to, the, growth, of, slavery, in, the, american, south, whitney, s, gin, made, cotton, farming, more, profitable, and, efficient, so, plantation, owners, expanded, their, plantations, and, used, more, of, their, slaves, to, pick, cotton, whitney, never, invented, the, machine, to, harvest, cotton, it, still, had, to, be, picked, by, hand, the, invention, has, thus, been, identified, as, an, inadvertent, contributing, factor, to, the, outbreak, of, the, american, civil, war, modern, automated, cotton, gins, use, multiple, powered, cleaning, cylinders, and, saws, and, offer, far, higher, productivity, than, their, hand, powered, precursors, cotton, fibers, are, produced, in, the, seed, pods, bolls, of, the, cotton, plant, where, the, fibers, lint, in, the, bolls, are, tightly, interwoven, with, seeds, to, make, the, fibers, usable, the, seeds, and, fibers, must, first, be, separated, a, task, which, had, been, previously, performed, manually, with, production, of, cotton, requiring, hours, of, labor, for, the, separation, many, simple, seed, removing, devices, had, been, invented, but, until, the, innovation, of, the, cotton, gin, most, required, significant, operator, attention, and, worked, only, on, a, small, scale, the, gin, is, made, with, two, rotating, cylinders, the, first, cylinder, has, lines, of, teeth, around, the, circumference, and, angled, against, this, cylinder, is, a, metal, plate, with, small, holes, ginning, ribs, through, which, the, teeth, can, fit, with, minimal, gaps, the, teeth, grip, the, cotton, fibers, as, the, mechanism, rotates, dragging, them, through, these, small, holes, the, seeds, are, too, big, to, fit, through, the, holes, and, are, thus, removed, from, the, rotating, cotton, by, the, metal, plate, before, they, fall, into, a, collecting, pot, on, the, other, side, of, the, first, cylinder, there, is, a, second, cylinder, also, rotating, with, brushes, attached, this, second, cylinder, wipes, the, cotton, from, the, first, and, deposits, it, into, the, collecting, bucket, the, seed, is, reused, for, planting, or, is, sent, to, an, oil, mill, to, be, further, processed, into, cottonseed, oil, and, cottonseed, meal, the, lint, cleaners, again, use, saws, and, grid, bars, this, time, to, separate, immature, seeds, and, any, remaining, foreign, matter, from, the, fibers, the, bale, press, then, compresses, the, cotton, into, bales, for, storage, and, shipping, modern, gins, can, process, up, to, 15, tonnes, 33, 000, lb, of, cotton, per, hour, a, single, roller, cotton, gin, came, into, use, in, india, by, the, 5th, century, an, improvement, invented, in, india, was, the, two, roller, gin, known, as, the, churka, charki, or, wooden, worm, worked, roller, the, earliest, versions, of, the, cotton, gin, consisted, of, a, single, roller, made, of, iron, or, wood, and, a, flat, piece, of, stone, or, wood, the, earliest, evidence, of, the, cotton, gin, is, found, in, the, fifth, century, in, the, form, of, buddhist, paintings, depicting, a, single, roller, gin, in, the, ajanta, caves, in, western, india, these, early, gins, were, difficult, to, use, and, required, a, great, deal, of, skill, a, narrow, single, roller, was, necessary, to, expel, the, seeds, from, the, cotton, without, crushing, the, seeds, the, design, was, similar, to, that, of, a, mealing, stone, which, was, used, to, grind, grain, the, early, history, of, the, cotton, gin, is, ambiguous, because, archeologists, likely, mistook, the, cotton, gin, s, parts, for, other, tools, between, the, 12th, and, 14th, centuries, dual, roller, gins, appeared, in, india, and, china, the, indian, version, of, the, dual, roller, gin, was, prevalent, throughout, the, mediterranean, cotton, trade, by, the, 16th, century, this, mechanical, device, was, in, some, areas, driven, by, waterpower, the, worm, gear, roller, gin, which, was, invented, in, the, indian, subcontinent, during, the, early, delhi, sultanate, era, of, the, 13th, to, 14th, centuries, came, into, use, in, the, mughal, empire, sometime, around, the, 16th, century, and, is, still, used, in, the, indian, subcontinent, through, to, the, present, day, another, innovation, the, incorporation, of, the, crank, handle, in, the, cotton, gin, first, appeared, sometime, during, the, late, delhi, sultanate, or, the, early, mughal, empire, the, incorporation, of, the, worm, gear, and, crank, handle, into, the, roller, cotton, gin, led, to, greatly, expanded, indian, cotton, textile, production, during, the, mughal, era, it, was, reported, that, with, an, indian, cotton, gin, which, is, half, machine, and, half, tool, one, man, and, one, woman, could, clean, 28, pounds, of, cotton, per, day, with, a, modified, forbes, version, one, man, and, a, boy, could, produce, 250, pounds, per, day, if, oxen, were, used, to, power, 16, of, these, machines, and, a, few, people, s, labor, was, used, to, feed, them, they, could, produce, as, much, work, as, 750, people, did, formerly, the, indian, roller, cotton, gin, known, as, the, churka, or, charkha, was, introduced, to, the, united, states, in, the, mid, 18th, century, when, it, was, adopted, in, the, southern, united, states, the, device, was, adopted, for, cleaning, long, staple, cotton, but, was, not, suitable, for, the, short, staple, cotton, that, was, more, common, in, certain, states, such, as, georgia, several, modifications, were, made, to, the, indian, roller, gin, by, mr, krebs, in, 1772, and, joseph, eve, in, 1788, but, their, uses, remained, limited, to, the, long, staple, variety, up, until, eli, whitney, s, development, of, a, short, staple, cotton, gin, in, 1793, eli, whitney, 1765, 1825, applied, for, a, patent, of, his, cotton, gin, on, october, 28, 1793, the, patent, was, granted, on, march, 14, 1794, but, was, not, validated, until, 1807, whitney, s, patent, was, assigned, patent, number, 72x, there, is, slight, controversy, over, whether, the, idea, of, the, modern, cotton, gin, and, its, constituent, elements, are, correctly, attributed, to, eli, whitney, the, popular, image, of, whitney, inventing, the, cotton, gin, is, attributed, to, an, article, on, the, subject, written, in, the, early, 1870s, and, later, reprinted, in, 1910, in, the, library, of, southern, literature, in, this, article, the, author, claimed, catharine, littlefield, greene, suggested, to, whitney, the, use, of, a, brush, like, component, instrumental, in, separating, out, the, seeds, and, cotton, greene, s, alleged, role, in, the, invention, of, the, gin, has, not, been, verified, independently, whitney, s, cotton, gin, model, was, capable, of, cleaning, 50, pounds, 23, kg, of, lint, per, day, the, model, consisted, of, a, wooden, cylinder, covered, by, rows, of, slender, wires, which, caught, the, fibers, of, the, cotton, bolls, each, row, of, wires, then, passed, through, the, bars, of, a, comb, like, grid, pulling, the, cotton, fibers, through, the, grid, as, they, did, the, comb, like, teeth, of, the, grids, were, closely, spaced, preventing, the, seeds, fragments, of, the, hard, dried, calyx, of, the, original, cotton, flower, or, sticks, and, other, debris, attached, to, the, fibers, from, passing, through, a, series, of, brushes, on, a, second, rotating, cylinder, then, brushed, the, now, cleaned, fibers, loose, from, the, wires, preventing, the, mechanism, from, jamming, many, contemporary, inventors, attempted, to, develop, a, design, that, would, process, short, staple, cotton, and, hodgen, holmes, robert, watkins, william, longstreet, and, john, murray, had, all, been, issued, patents, for, improvements, to, the, cotton, gin, by, 1796, however, the, evidence, indicates, whitney, did, invent, the, saw, gin, for, which, he, is, famous, although, he, spent, many, years, in, court, attempting, to, enforce, his, patent, against, planters, who, made, unauthorized, copies, a, change, in, patent, law, ultimately, made, his, claim, legally, enforceable, too, late, for, him, to, make, much, money, from, the, device, in, the, single, year, remaining, before, the, patent, expired, while, whitney, s, gin, facilitated, the, cleaning, of, seeds, from, short, staple, cotton, it, damaged, the, fibers, of, extra, long, staple, cotton, gossypium, barbadense, in, 1840, fones, mccarthy, received, a, patent, for, a, smooth, cylinder, cotton, gin, a, roller, gin, mccarthy, s, gin, was, marketed, for, use, with, both, short, staple, and, extra, long, staple, cotton, but, was, particularly, useful, for, processing, long, staple, cotton, after, mccarthy, s, patent, expired, in, 1861, mccarthy, type, gins, were, manufactured, in, britain, and, sold, around, the, world, mccarthy, s, gin, was, adopted, for, cleaning, the, sea, island, variety, of, extra, long, staple, cotton, grown, in, florida, georgia, and, south, carolina, it, cleaned, cotton, several, times, faster, than, the, older, gins, and, when, powered, by, one, horse, produced, 150, to, 200, pounds, of, lint, a, day, the, mccarthy, gin, used, a, reciprocating, knife, to, detach, seed, from, the, lint, vibration, caused, by, the, reciprocating, motion, limited, the, speed, at, which, the, gin, could, operate, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, gins, using, a, rotating, blade, replaced, ones, using, a, reciprocating, blade, these, descendants, of, the, mccarthy, gin, are, the, only, gins, now, used, for, extra, long, staple, cotton, in, the, united, states, for, a, decade, and, a, half, after, the, end, of, the, civil, war, in, 1865, a, number, of, innovative, features, became, widely, used, for, ginning, in, the, united, states, they, included, steam, power, instead, of, animal, power, an, automatic, feeder, to, assure, that, the, gin, stand, ran, smoothly, a, condenser, to, make, the, clean, cotton, coming, out, of, the, gin, easier, to, handle, and, indoor, presses, so, that, cotton, no, longer, had, to, be, carried, across, the, gin, yard, to, be, baled, then, in, 1879, while, he, was, running, his, father, s, gin, in, rutersville, texas, robert, s, munger, invented, additional, system, ginning, techniques, robert, and, his, wife, mary, collett, later, moved, to, mexia, texas, built, a, system, gin, and, obtained, related, patents, the, munger, system, ginning, outfit, or, system, gin, integrated, all, the, ginning, operation, machinery, thus, assuring, the, cotton, would, flow, through, the, machines, smoothly, such, system, gins, use, air, to, move, cotton, from, machine, to, machine, munger, s, motivation, for, his, inventions, included, improving, employee, working, conditions, in, the, gin, however, the, selling, point, for, most, gin, owners, was, the, accompanying, cost, savings, while, producing, cotton, both, more, speedily, and, of, higher, quality, by, the, 1960s, many, other, advances, had, been, made, in, ginning, machinery, but, the, manner, in, which, cotton, flowed, through, the, gin, machinery, continued, to, be, the, munger, system, economic, historian, william, h, phillips, referred, to, the, development, of, system, ginning, as, the, munger, revolution, in, cotton, ginning, he, wrote, the, munger, innovations, were, the, culmination, of, what, geographer, charles, s, aiken, has, termed, the, second, ginning, revolution, in, which, the, privately, owned, plantation, gins, were, replaced, by, large, scale, public, ginneries, this, revolution, in, turn, led, to, a, major, restructuring, of, the, cotton, gin, industry, as, the, small, scattered, gin, factories, and, shops, of, the, nineteenth, century, gave, way, to, a, dwindling, number, of, large, twentieth, century, corporations, designing, and, constructing, entire, ginning, operations, one, of, the, few, and, perhaps, only, examples, of, a, munger, gin, left, in, existence, is, on, display, at, frogmore, plantation, in, louisiana, prior, to, the, introduction, of, the, mechanical, cotton, gin, cotton, had, required, considerable, labor, to, clean, and, separate, the, fibers, from, the, seeds, with, eli, whitney, s, gin, cotton, became, a, tremendously, profitable, business, creating, many, fortunes, in, the, antebellum, south, cities, such, as, new, orleans, louisiana, mobile, alabama, charleston, south, carolina, and, galveston, texas, became, major, shipping, ports, deriving, substantial, economic, benefit, from, cotton, raised, throughout, the, south, additionally, the, greatly, expanded, supply, of, cotton, created, strong, demand, for, textile, machinery, and, improved, machine, designs, that, replaced, wooden, parts, with, metal, this, led, to, the, invention, of, many, machine, tools, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, invention, of, the, cotton, gin, caused, massive, growth, in, the, production, of, cotton, in, the, united, states, concentrated, mostly, in, the, south, cotton, production, expanded, from, 750, 000, bales, in, 1830, to, 2, 85, million, bales, in, 1850, as, a, result, the, region, became, even, more, dependent, on, plantations, that, used, black, slave, labor, with, plantation, agriculture, becoming, the, largest, sector, of, its, economy, while, it, took, a, single, laborer, about, ten, hours, to, separate, a, single, pound, of, fiber, from, the, seeds, a, team, of, two, or, three, slaves, using, a, cotton, gin, could, produce, around, fifty, pounds, of, cotton, in, just, one, day, the, number, of, slaves, rose, in, concert, with, the, increase, in, cotton, production, increasing, from, around, 700, 000, in, 1790, to, around, 3, 2, million, in, 1850, the, invention, of, the, cotton, gin, led, to, increased, demands, for, slave, labor, in, the, american, south, reversing, the, economic, decline, that, had, occurred, in, the, region, during, the, late, 18th, century, the, cotton, gin, thus, transformed, cotton, as, a, crop, and, the, american, south, into, the, globe, s, first, agricultural, powerhouse, the, invention, of, the, cotton, gin, led, to, an, increase, in, the, use, of, slaves, on, southern, plantations, because, of, that, inadvertent, effect, on, american, slavery, which, ensured, that, the, south, s, economy, developed, in, the, direction, of, plantation, based, agriculture, while, encouraging, the, growth, of, the, textile, industry, elsewhere, such, as, in, the, north, the, invention, of, the, cotton, gin, is, frequently, cited, as, one, of, the, indirect, causes, of, the, american, civil, war, in, modern, cotton, production, cotton, arrives, at, industrial, cotton, gins, either, in, trailers, in, compressed, rectangular, modules, weighing, up, to, 10, metric, tons, each, or, in, polyethylene, wrapped, round, modules, similar, to, a, bale, of, hay, produced, during, the, picking, process, by, the, most, recent, generation, of, cotton, pickers, trailer, cotton, i, e, cotton, not, compressed, into, modules, arriving, at, the, gin, is, sucked, in, via, a, pipe, approximately, 16, inches, 41, cm, in, diameter, that, is, swung, over, the, cotton, this, pipe, is, usually, manually, operated, but, is, increasingly, automated, in, modern, cotton, plants, the, need, for, trailers, to, haul, the, product, to, the, gin, has, been, drastically, reduced, since, the, introduction, of, modules, if, the, cotton, is, shipped, in, modules, the, module, feeder, breaks, the, modules, apart, using, spiked, rollers, and, extracts, the, largest, pieces, of, foreign, material, from, the, cotton, the, module, feeder, s, loose, cotton, is, then, sucked, into, the, same, starting, point, as, the, trailer, cotton, the, cotton, then, enters, a, dryer, which, removes, excess, moisture, the, cylinder, cleaner, uses, six, or, seven, rotating, spiked, cylinders, to, break, up, large, clumps, of, cotton, finer, foreign, material, such, as, soil, and, leaves, passes, through, rods, or, screens, for, removal, the, stick, machine, uses, centrifugal, force, to, remove, larger, foreign, matter, such, as, sticks, and, burrs, while, the, cotton, is, held, by, rapidly, rotating, saw, cylinders, the, gin, stand, uses, the, teeth, of, rotating, saws, to, pull, the, cotton, through, a, series, of, ginning, ribs, which, pull, the, fibers, from, the, seeds, which, are, too, large, to, pass, through, the, ribs, the, cleaned, seed, is, then, removed, from, the, gin, via, an, auger, conveyor, system, the, seed, is, reused, for, planting, or, is, sent, to, an, oil, mill, to, be, further, processed, into, cottonseed, oil, and, cottonseed, meal, the, lint, cleaners, again, use, saws, and, grid, bars, this, time, to, separate, immature, seeds, and, any, remaining, foreign, matter, from, the, fibers, the, bale, press, then, compresses, the, cotton, into, bales, for, storage, and, shipping, modern, gins, can, process, up, to, 15, tonnes, 33, 000, lb, of, cotton, per, hour, modern, cotton, gins, create, a, substantial, amount, of, cotton, gin, residue, cgr, consisting, of, sticks, leaves, dirt, immature, bolls, and, cottonseed, research, is, currently, under, way, to, investigate, the, use, of, this, waste, in, producing, ethanol, due, to, fluctuations, in, the, chemical, composition, in, processing, there, is, difficulty, in, creating, a, consistent, ethanol, process, but, there, is, potential, to, further, maximize, the, utilization, of, waste, in, the, cotton, production, notes, bibliography
