https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_(weapon)
a, sling, is, a, projectile, weapon, typically, used, to, hand, throw, a, blunt, projectile, such, as, a, stone, clay, or, lead, sling, bullet, it, is, also, known, as, the, shepherd, s, sling, or, slingshot, in, british, english, although, elsewhere, it, means, something, else, someone, who, specializes, in, using, slings, is, called, a, slinger, a, sling, has, a, small, cradle, or, pouch, in, the, middle, of, two, retention, cords, where, a, projectile, is, placed, there, is, a, loop, on, the, end, of, one, side, of, the, retention, cords, depending, on, the, design, of, the, sling, either, the, middle, finger, or, the, wrist, is, placed, through, a, loop, on, the, end, of, one, cord, and, a, tab, at, the, end, of, the, other, cord, is, placed, between, the, thumb, and, forefinger, the, sling, is, swung, in, an, arc, and, the, tab, released, at, a, precise, moment, this, action, releases, the, projectile, to, fly, inertially, and, ballistically, towards, the, target, by, its, double, pendulum, kinetics, the, sling, enables, stones, or, spears, to, be, thrown, much, further, than, they, could, be, by, hand, alone, the, sling, is, inexpensive, and, easy, to, build, historically, it, has, been, used, for, hunting, game, and, in, combat, today, the, sling, is, of, interest, as, a, wilderness, survival, tool, and, an, improvised, weapon, the, sling, is, an, ancient, weapon, known, to, neolithic, peoples, around, the, mediterranean, but, is, likely, to, be, much, older, it, is, possible, that, the, sling, was, invented, during, the, upper, palaeolithic, at, a, time, when, new, technologies, such, as, the, spear, thrower, and, the, bow, and, arrow, were, beginning, to, emerge, in, australia, the, woomera, has, the, same, mechanical, dynamics, as, the, sling, transducing, rotational, movement, into, linear, projection, although, it, is, not, known, whether, this, was, an, independent, invention, or, not, whereas, stones, and, clay, objects, thought, by, many, archaeologists, to, be, sling, bullets, are, common, finds, in, the, archaeological, record, slings, themselves, are, rare, this, is, both, because, a, sling, s, materials, are, biodegradable, and, because, slings, were, lower, status, weapons, rarely, preserved, in, a, wealthy, person, s, grave, the, oldest, known, surviving, slings, radiocarbon, dated, to, c, 2500, bc, were, recovered, from, south, american, archaeological, sites, on, the, coast, of, peru, the, oldest, known, surviving, north, american, sling, radiocarbon, dated, to, c, 1200, bc, was, recovered, from, lovelock, cave, nevada, the, oldest, known, extant, slings, from, the, old, world, were, found, in, the, tomb, of, tutankhamun, who, died, c, 1325, bc, a, pair, of, finely, plaited, slings, were, found, with, other, weapons, the, sling, was, probably, intended, for, the, departed, pharaoh, to, use, for, hunting, game, another, egyptian, sling, was, excavated, in, el, lahun, in, al, fayyum, egypt, in, 1914, by, william, matthew, flinders, petrie, and, is, now, in, the, petrie, museum, of, egyptian, archaeology, petrie, dated, it, to, c, 800, bc, it, was, found, alongside, an, iron, spearhead, the, remains, are, broken, into, three, sections, although, fragile, the, construction, is, clear, it, is, made, of, bast, fibre, almost, certainly, flax, twine, the, cords, are, braided, in, a, 10, strand, elliptical, sennit, and, the, cradle, seems, to, have, been, woven, from, the, same, lengths, of, twine, used, to, form, the, cords, representations, of, slingers, can, be, found, on, artifacts, from, all, over, the, ancient, world, including, assyrian, and, egyptian, reliefs, the, columns, of, trajan, and, marcus, aurelius, on, coins, and, on, the, bayeux, tapestry, the, oldest, representation, of, a, slinger, in, art, may, be, from, atalh, y, k, from, c, 7, 000, bc, though, it, is, the, only, such, depiction, at, the, site, despite, numerous, depictions, of, archers, many, european, middle, eastern, asian, and, african, peoples, were, users, of, slings, thucydides, and, others, authors, talk, about, its, usage, by, greeks, and, romans, and, strabo, also, extends, it, to, the, iberians, lusitanians, and, even, some, gauls, which, caesar, describes, further, in, his, account, of, the, siege, of, bibrax, he, also, mentions, persians, and, arabs, among, those, who, used, them, for, his, part, diodorus, includes, libyans, and, phoenicians, britons, were, frequent, users, of, slings, too, livy, mentions, the, most, famous, of, ancient, skillful, slingers, the, people, of, the, balearic, islands, who, often, worked, as, mercenaries, of, balearic, slingers, strabo, writes, and, their, training, in, the, use, of, slings, used, to, be, such, from, childhood, up, that, they, would, not, so, much, as, give, bread, to, their, children, unless, they, first, hit, it, with, the, sling, the, sling, is, mentioned, as, early, as, in, the, writings, of, homer, where, several, characters, kill, enemies, by, hurling, stones, at, them, balearic, slingers, were, amongst, the, specialist, mercenaries, extensively, employed, by, carthage, against, the, romans, and, other, enemies, these, light, troops, used, three, sizes, of, sling, according, to, the, distance, of, their, opponents, the, weapons, were, made, of, vegetable, fibre, and, animal, sinew, launching, either, stones, or, lead, missiles, with, devastating, impact, xenophon, in, his, history, of, the, retreat, of, the, ten, thousand, 401, bc, relates, that, the, greeks, suffered, severely, from, the, slingers, in, the, army, of, artaxerxes, ii, of, persia, while, they, themselves, had, neither, cavalry, nor, slingers, and, were, unable, to, reach, the, enemy, with, their, arrows, and, javelins, this, deficiency, was, rectified, when, a, company, of, 200, rhodians, who, understood, the, use, of, leaden, sling, bullets, was, formed, they, were, able, says, xenophon, to, project, their, missiles, twice, as, far, as, the, persian, slingers, who, used, large, stones, various, greeks, enjoyed, a, reputation, for, skill, with, the, sling, thucydides, mentions, the, acarnanians, and, livy, refers, to, the, inhabitants, of, three, greek, cities, on, the, northern, coast, of, the, peloponnesus, as, expert, slingers, greek, armies, would, also, use, mounted, slingers, roman, skirmishers, armed, with, slings, and, javelins, were, established, by, servius, tullius, the, late, roman, writer, vegetius, in, his, work, de, re, militari, wrote, recruits, are, to, be, taught, the, art, of, throwing, stones, both, with, the, hand, and, sling, the, inhabitants, of, the, balearic, islands, are, said, to, have, been, the, inventors, of, slings, and, to, have, managed, them, with, surprising, dexterity, owing, to, the, manner, of, bringing, up, their, children, the, children, were, not, allowed, to, have, their, food, by, their, mothers, till, they, had, first, struck, it, with, their, sling, soldiers, notwithstanding, their, defensive, armour, are, often, more, annoyed, by, the, round, stones, from, the, sling, than, by, all, the, arrows, of, the, enemy, stones, kill, without, mangling, the, body, and, the, contusion, is, mortal, without, loss, of, blood, it, is, universally, known, the, ancients, employed, slingers, in, all, their, engagements, there, is, the, greater, reason, for, instructing, all, troops, without, exception, in, this, exercise, as, the, sling, cannot, be, reckoned, any, encumbrance, and, often, is, of, the, greatest, service, especially, when, they, are, obliged, to, engage, in, stony, places, to, defend, a, mountain, or, an, eminence, or, to, repulse, an, enemy, at, the, attack, of, a, castle, or, city, the, sling, is, mentioned, in, the, bible, which, provides, what, is, believed, to, be, the, oldest, textual, reference, to, a, sling, in, the, book, of, judges, 20, 16, this, text, was, thought, to, have, been, written, c, 6th, century, bc, but, refers, to, events, several, centuries, earlier, the, bible, provides, a, famous, slinger, account, the, battle, between, david, and, goliath, from, the, first, book, of, samuel, 17, 34, 36, probably, written, in, the, 7th, or, 6th, century, bc, describing, events, that, might, have, occurred, c, 10th, century, bc, the, sling, easily, produced, was, the, weapon, of, choice, for, shepherds, fending, off, animals, due, to, this, the, sling, was, a, commonly, used, weapon, by, the, israelite, militia, goliath, was, a, tall, well, equipped, and, experienced, warrior, in, this, account, the, shepherd, david, persuades, saul, to, let, him, fight, goliath, on, behalf, of, the, israelites, unarmoured, and, equipped, only, with, a, sling, five, smooth, rocks, and, his, staff, david, defeats, the, champion, goliath, with, a, well, aimed, shot, to, the, head, use, of, the, sling, is, also, mentioned, in, second, kings, 3, 25, first, chronicles, 12, 2, and, second, chronicles, 26, 14, to, further, illustrate, israelite, use, ancient, peoples, used, the, sling, in, combat, armies, included, both, specialist, slingers, and, regular, soldiers, equipped, with, slings, as, a, weapon, the, sling, had, several, advantages, a, sling, bullet, lobbed, in, a, high, trajectory, can, achieve, ranges, in, excess, of, 400, m, 1, 300, ft, modern, authorities, vary, widely, in, their, estimates, of, the, effective, range, of, ancient, weapons, a, bow, and, arrow, could, also, have, been, used, to, produce, a, long, range, arcing, trajectory, but, ancient, writers, repeatedly, stress, the, sling, s, advantage, of, range, the, sling, was, light, to, carry, and, cheap, to, produce, ammunition, in, the, form, of, stones, was, readily, available, and, often, to, be, found, near, the, site, of, battle, the, ranges, the, sling, could, achieve, with, moulded, lead, sling, bullets, was, surpassed, only, by, the, strong, composite, bow, caches, of, sling, ammunition, have, been, found, at, the, sites, of, iron, age, hill, forts, of, europe, some, 22, 000, sling, stones, were, found, at, maiden, castle, dorset, it, is, proposed, that, iron, age, hill, forts, of, europe, were, designed, to, maximize, the, effective, defence, by, slingers, the, hilltop, location, of, the, wooden, forts, would, have, given, the, defending, slingers, the, advantage, of, range, over, the, attackers, and, multiple, concentric, ramparts, each, higher, than, the, other, would, allow, a, large, number, of, men, to, create, a, hailstorm, of, stone, consistent, with, this, it, has, been, noted, that, defences, are, generally, narrow, where, the, natural, slope, is, steep, and, wider, where, the, slope, is, more, gradual, a, classic, sling, is, braided, from, non, elastic, material, the, traditional, materials, are, flax, hemp, or, wool, slings, by, balearic, islanders, were, said, to, be, made, from, a, rush, flax, and, hemp, resist, rotting, but, wool, is, softer, and, more, comfortable, polyester, is, often, used, for, modern, slings, because, it, does, not, rot, or, stretch, and, is, soft, and, free, of, splinters, braided, cords, are, used, in, preference, to, twisted, rope, as, a, braid, resists, twisting, when, stretched, this, improves, accuracy, the, overall, length, of, a, sling, can, vary, a, slinger, may, have, slings, of, different, lengths, a, longer, sling, is, used, when, greater, range, is, required, a, length, of, about, 61, to, 100, cm, 2, 0, to, 3, 3, ft, is, typical, at, the, centre, of, the, sling, a, cradle, or, pouch, is, constructed, this, may, be, formed, by, making, a, wide, braid, from, the, same, material, as, the, cords, or, by, inserting, a, piece, of, a, different, material, such, as, leather, the, cradle, is, typically, diamond, shaped, although, some, take, the, form, of, a, net, and, will, fold, around, the, projectile, in, use, some, cradles, have, a, hole, or, slit, that, allows, the, material, to, wrap, around, the, projectile, slightly, thereby, holding, it, more, securely, at, the, end, of, one, cord, called, the, retention, cord, a, finger, loop, is, formed, at, the, end, of, the, other, cord, the, release, cord, it, is, a, common, practice, to, form, a, knot, or, a, tab, the, release, cord, will, be, held, between, finger, and, thumb, to, be, released, at, just, the, right, moment, and, may, have, a, complex, braid, to, add, bulk, to, the, end, this, makes, the, knot, easier, to, hold, and, the, extra, weight, allows, the, loose, end, of, a, discharged, sling, to, be, recovered, with, a, flick, of, the, wrist, braided, construction, resists, stretching, and, therefore, produces, an, accurate, sling, modern, slings, are, begun, by, plaiting, the, cord, for, the, finger, loop, in, the, centre, of, a, double, length, set, of, cords, the, cords, are, then, folded, to, form, the, finger, loop, the, retained, cord, is, then, plaited, away, from, the, loop, as, a, single, cord, up, to, the, pocket, the, pocket, is, then, plaited, most, simply, as, another, pair, of, cords, or, with, flat, braids, or, a, woven, net, the, remainder, of, the, sling, the, released, cord, is, plaited, as, a, single, cord, and, then, finished, with, a, knot, or, plaited, tab, ancient, poets, wrote, that, sling, bullets, could, penetrate, armour, and, that, lead, projectiles, heated, by, their, passage, through, the, air, would, melt, in, flight, in, the, first, instance, it, seems, likely, that, the, authors, were, indicating, that, slings, could, cause, injury, through, armour, by, a, percussive, effect, i, e, the, energy, of, a, sling, bullet, delivered, at, high, velocity, causing, blunt, trauma, injury, upon, impact, rather, than, by, penetration, in, the, latter, case, we, may, imagine, that, they, were, impressed, by, the, degree, of, deformation, suffered, by, lead, sling, bullet, after, hitting, a, hard, target, according, to, description, of, procopius, the, sling, had, an, effective, range, further, than, a, hun, bow, and, arrow, in, his, book, wars, of, justinian, he, recorded, the, felling, of, a, hun, warrior, by, a, slinger, now, one, of, the, huns, who, was, fighting, before, the, others, was, making, more, trouble, for, the, romans, than, all, the, rest, and, some, rustic, made, a, good, shot, and, hit, him, on, the, right, knee, with, a, sling, and, he, immediately, fell, headlong, from, his, horse, to, the, ground, which, thing, heartened, the, romans, still, more, the, simplest, projectile, was, a, stone, preferably, well, rounded, suitable, ammunition, is, frequently, from, a, river, or, a, beach, the, size, of, the, projectiles, can, vary, dramatically, from, pebbles, massing, no, more, than, 50, g, 1, 8, oz, to, fist, sized, stones, massing, 500, g, 18, oz, or, more, the, use, of, such, stones, as, projectiles, is, well, attested, in, the, ethnographic, record, possible, projectiles, were, also, purpose, made, from, clay, this, allowed, a, very, high, consistency, of, size, and, shape, to, aid, range, and, accuracy, many, examples, have, been, found, in, the, archaeological, record, the, best, ammunition, was, cast, from, lead, leaden, sling, bullets, were, widely, used, in, the, greek, and, roman, world, for, a, given, mass, lead, being, very, dense, offers, the, minimum, size, and, therefore, minimum, air, resistance, in, addition, leaden, sling, bullets, are, small, and, difficult, to, see, in, flight, their, concentrated, impact, is, also, a, better, armour, piercer, and, better, able, to, penetrate, a, body, in, some, cases, the, lead, would, be, cast, in, a, simple, open, mould, made, by, pushing, a, finger, or, thumb, into, sand, and, pouring, molten, metal, into, the, hole, however, sling, bullets, were, more, frequently, cast, in, two, part, moulds, such, sling, bullets, come, in, a, number, of, shapes, including, an, ellipsoidal, form, closely, resembling, an, acorn, this, could, be, the, origin, of, the, latin, word, for, a, leaden, sling, bullet, glandes, plumbeae, literally, leaden, acorns, or, simply, glandes, meaning, acorns, singular, glans, other, shapes, include, spherical, and, by, far, the, most, common, biconical, which, resembles, the, shape, of, the, shell, of, an, almond, nut, or, a, flattened, american, football, the, ancients, do, not, seem, to, have, taken, advantage, of, the, manufacturing, process, to, produce, consistent, results, leaden, sling, bullets, vary, significantly, the, reason, why, the, almond, shape, was, favoured, is, not, clear, it, is, possible, that, there, is, some, aerodynamic, advantage, but, it, seems, equally, likely, that, there, is, some, more, prosaic, reason, such, as, the, shape, being, easy, to, extract, from, a, mould, or, the, fact, that, it, will, rest, in, a, sling, cradle, with, little, danger, of, rolling, out, it, is, possible, as, well, that, the, almond, non, circular, shape, made, the, bullet, spin, in, flight, in, a, helicopter, or, disc, like, effect, adding, to, the, flight, distance, almond, shaped, leaden, sling, bullets, were, typically, 35, mm, 1, 4, in, long, 20, mm, 0, 79, in, wide, and, weighs, 28, g, 0, 99, oz, very, often, symbols, or, writings, were, moulded, into, lead, sling, bullets, many, examples, have, been, found, including, a, collection, of, about, 80, sling, bullets, from, the, siege, of, perusia, in, etruria, from, 41, bc, to, be, found, in, the, museum, of, modern, perugia, examples, of, symbols, include, a, stylized, lightning, bolt, a, snake, and, a, scorpion, reminders, of, how, a, sling, might, strike, without, warning, writing, might, include, the, name, of, the, owning, military, unit, or, commander, or, might, be, more, imaginative, take, this, ouch, get, pregnant, with, this, and, even, for, pompey, s, backside, added, insult, to, injury, whereas, dexai, take, this, or, catch, is, merely, sarcastic, in, yavne, a, sling, bullet, with, the, greek, inscription, victory, of, heracles, and, hauronas, was, discovered, the, two, gods, were, the, patrons, of, the, city, during, the, hellenistic, period, julius, caesar, writes, in, de, bello, gallico, book, 5, about, clay, shot, being, heated, before, slinging, so, that, it, might, set, fire, to, thatch, some, bullets, have, been, found, with, holes, drilled, in, them, it, was, thought, the, holes, were, to, contain, poison, john, reid, of, the, trimontium, trust, finding, holed, roman, bullets, excavated, at, the, burnswark, hillfort, has, proposed, that, the, holes, would, cause, the, bullets, to, whistle, in, flight, and, the, sound, would, intimidate, opponents, the, holed, bullets, were, generally, small, and, thus, not, particularly, dangerous, several, could, fit, into, a, pouch, and, a, single, slinger, could, produce, a, terrorizing, barrage, experiments, with, modern, copies, demonstrate, they, produce, a, whooshing, sound, in, flight, the, bayeux, tapestry, of, the, 1070s, portrays, the, use, of, slings, in, a, hunting, context, frederick, i, holy, roman, emperor, employed, slingers, during, the, siege, of, tortona, in, 1155, to, suppress, the, garrison, while, his, own, men, built, siege, engines, indeed, slings, seem, to, have, been, a, fairly, common, weapon, in, italy, during, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, slings, were, also, used, by, the, byzantines, on, the, iberian, peninsula, the, spanish, and, portuguese, infantry, favoured, it, against, light, and, agile, moorish, troops, the, staff, sling, continued, to, be, used, in, sieges, and, the, sling, was, used, as, a, part, of, large, siege, engines, the, sling, was, known, throughout, the, americas, in, ancient, andean, civilizations, such, as, the, inca, empire, slings, were, made, from, llama, wool, these, slings, typically, have, a, cradle, that, is, long, and, thin, and, features, a, relatively, long, slit, andean, slings, were, constructed, from, contrasting, colours, of, wool, complex, braids, and, fine, workmanship, can, result, in, beautiful, patterns, ceremonial, slings, were, also, made, these, were, large, non, functional, and, generally, lacked, a, slit, to, this, day, ceremonial, slings, are, used, in, parts, of, the, andes, as, accessories, in, dances, and, in, mock, battles, they, are, also, used, by, llama, herders, the, animals, will, move, away, from, the, sound, of, a, stone, landing, the, stones, are, not, slung, to, hit, the, animals, but, to, persuade, them, to, move, in, the, desired, direction, the, sling, was, also, used, in, the, americas, for, hunting, and, warfare, one, notable, use, was, in, incan, resistance, against, the, conquistadors, these, slings, were, apparently, very, powerful, in, 1491, new, revelations, of, the, americas, before, columbus, historian, charles, c, mann, quoted, a, conquistador, as, saying, that, an, incan, sling, could, break, a, sword, in, two, pieces, and, kill, a, horse, some, slings, spanned, as, much, as, 2, 2, meters, 86, in, long, and, weighed, an, impressive, 410, grams, 14, 4, oz, unique, amongst, most, pacific, islanders, the, chamorro, reached, a, terrific, competency, with, a, weapon, as, witness, by, 17th, century, belgian, missionary, pedro, coomans, their, offensive, weapons, include, the, sling, which, they, aim, very, skillfully, at, the, head, out, of, small, ropes, they, weave, a, sort, of, net, bag, in, which, to, carry, stones, with, an, oblong, shape, some, formed, out, of, a, marble, stone, and, others, of, clay, hardened, in, either, the, sun, or, fire, they, whirl, and, shoot, those, so, violently, should, it, make, an, impact, upon, a, more, delicate, part, like, the, heart, or, the, head, the, man, is, flattened, on, the, spot, then, if, envy, would, make, them, want, to, burn, a, house, from, a, distance, they, would, stuff, the, perforated, side, of, it, with, tow, burning, with, a, very, ferocious, fire, which, with, a, swift, movement, became, a, flame, and, sail, away, to, seek, shelter, in, enemy, houses, the, sling, stone, in, its, almond, ovoid, shape, is, a, vital, cultural, artifact, of, chamorro, culture, enough, so, that, it, was, adopted, for, the, guamian, flag, and, state, seal, the, staff, sling, also, known, as, the, stave, sling, fustibalus, latin, and, fustibale, french, consists, of, a, staff, a, length, of, wood, with, a, short, sling, at, one, end, one, cord, of, the, sling, is, firmly, attached, to, the, stave, and, the, other, end, has, a, loop, that, can, slide, off, and, release, the, projectile, staff, slings, are, extremely, powerful, because, the, stave, can, be, made, as, long, as, two, meters, creating, a, powerful, lever, ancient, art, shows, slingers, holding, staff, slings, by, one, end, with, the, pocket, behind, them, and, using, both, hands, to, throw, the, staves, forward, over, their, heads, the, staff, sling, has, a, similar, or, superior, range, to, the, shepherd, s, sling, and, can, be, as, accurate, in, practiced, hands, it, is, generally, suited, for, heavier, missiles, and, siege, situations, as, staff, slings, can, achieve, very, steep, trajectories, for, slinging, over, obstacles, such, as, castle, walls, the, staff, itself, can, become, a, close, combat, weapon, in, a, melee, the, staff, sling, is, able, to, throw, heavy, projectiles, a, much, greater, distance, and, at, a, higher, arc, than, a, hand, sling, staff, slings, were, in, use, well, into, the, age, of, gunpowder, as, grenade, launchers, and, were, used, in, ship, to, ship, combat, to, throw, incendiaries, piao, shi, lit, whirlwind, stone, also, known, as, shou, pao, lit, hand, cannon, during, the, song, period, is, the, chinese, name, for, staff, sling, it, consists, of, a, short, cord, tied, to, one, end, of, a, five, chi, bamboo, pole, and, is, usually, employed, in, siege, defense, alongside, larger, stone, throwers, it, is, depicted, and, described, in, the, ji, xiao, xin, shu, the, kestros, also, known, as, the, kestrosphendone, cestrus, or, cestrosphendone, is, a, sling, weapon, mentioned, by, livy, and, polybius, it, seems, to, have, been, a, heavy, dart, flung, from, a, leather, sling, it, was, invented, in, 168, bc, and, was, employed, by, some, of, the, macedonian, troops, of, king, perseus, in, the, third, macedonian, war, the, traction, trebuchet, was, a, siege, engine, which, uses, the, power, of, men, pulling, on, ropes, or, the, energy, stored,
