a, shovel, is, a, tool, used, for, digging, lifting, and, moving, bulk, materials, such, as, soil, coal, gravel, snow, sand, or, ore, most, shovels, are, hand, tools, consisting, of, a, broad, blade, fixed, to, a, medium, length, handle, shovel, blades, are, usually, made, of, sheet, steel, or, hard, plastics, and, are, very, strong, shovel, handles, are, usually, made, of, wood, especially, specific, varieties, such, as, ash, or, maple, or, glass, reinforced, plastic, fiberglass, hand, shovel, blades, made, of, sheet, steel, usually, have, a, folded, seam, or, hem, at, the, back, to, make, a, socket, for, the, handle, this, fold, also, commonly, provides, extra, rigidity, to, the, blade, the, handles, are, usually, riveted, in, place, a, t, piece, is, commonly, fitted, to, the, end, of, the, handle, to, aid, grip, and, control, where, the, shovel, is, designed, for, moving, soil, and, heavy, materials, these, designs, can, all, be, easily, mass, produced, the, term, shovel, also, applies, to, larger, excavating, machines, called, power, shovels, which, serve, the, same, purpose, digging, lifting, and, moving, material, although, such, modern, power, shovels, as, front, end, loaders, and, excavators, including, tractors, that, feature, a, loading, bucket, on, one, end, and, a, backhoe, for, digging, and, placing, material, on, the, other, descend, from, steam, shovels, and, perform, similar, work, they, are, not, classified, as, shovels, hand, shovels, have, been, adapted, for, many, different, tasks, and, environments, they, can, be, optimized, for, a, single, task, or, designed, as, cross, over, or, compromise, multitaskers, they, are, commonly, used, in, agriculture, it, is, also, utilized, in, archaeology, to, locate, and, excavate, all, subsurface, dirt, in, the, neolithic, age, and, earlier, a, large, animal, s, scapula, shoulder, blade, was, often, used, as, a, crude, shovel, or, spade, shovels, at, this, time, were, often, used, for, farming, the, later, invention, of, purpose, built, shovels, was, a, ground, breaking, development, manual, shoveling, often, in, combination, with, picking, was, the, chief, means, of, excavation, in, construction, until, mechanization, via, steam, shovels, and, later, hydraulic, equipment, excavators, such, as, backhoes, and, loaders, gradually, replaced, most, manual, shoveling, the, same, is, also, true, of, the, history, of, mining, and, quarrying, and, of, bulk, materials, handling, in, industries, such, as, steelmaking, and, stevedoring, railroad, cars, and, cargo, holds, containing, ore, coal, gravel, sand, or, grains, were, often, loaded, and, unloaded, this, way, these, industries, did, not, always, rely, exclusively, on, such, work, but, such, work, was, a, ubiquitous, part, of, them, until, the, 1950s, manual, shoveling, employed, large, numbers, of, workers, groups, of, workers, called, labor, gangs, were, assigned, to, whatever, digging, or, bulk, materials, handling, was, needed, in, any, given, week, and, dozens, or, hundreds, of, workers, with, hand, shovels, would, do, the, kind, of, rapid, excavating, or, materials, handling, that, today, is, usually, accomplished, with, powered, excavators, and, loaders, operated, by, a, few, skilled, operators, thus, the, cost, of, labor, even, when, each, individual, worker, was, poorly, paid, was, a, tremendous, expense, of, operations, productivity, of, the, business, was, tied, mostly, to, labor, productivity, it, still, often, is, even, today, but, in, the, past, it, was, even, more, so, in, industrial, and, commercial, materials, handling, hand, shoveling, was, later, replaced, with, loaders, and, backhoes, given, the, central, importance, and, cost, of, manual, labour, in, industry, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, science, of, shoveling, was, something, of, great, interest, to, developers, of, scientific, management, such, as, frederick, winslow, taylor, taylor, with, his, focus, on, time, and, motion, study, took, an, interest, in, differentiating, the, many, motions, of, manual, labor, to, a, far, greater, degree, than, others, tended, to, managers, might, not, care, to, analyze, it, possibly, motivated, by, the, assumption, that, manual, labor, is, intellectually, simple, work, and, workers, might, not, care, to, analyze, it, in, any, way, that, encouraged, management, to, take, away, the, prerogative, in, craft, work, for, the, craftsman, to, decide, the, details, of, his, methods, taylor, realized, that, failing, to, analyze, shoveling, practice, represented, a, missed, opportunity, to, discover, or, synthesize, best, practices, for, shoveling, which, could, achieve, highest, productivity, value, for, dollar, spent, it, was, taylor, and, colleagues, in, the, 1890s, through, 1910s, that, greatly, expanded, the, existing, idea, of, varied, shovel, designs, with, different, sized, scoops, one, for, each, material, based, on, the, material, s, density, under, scientific, management, it, was, no, longer, acceptable, to, use, the, same, shovel, for, shoveling, brown, coal, one, day, and, gravel, the, next, taylor, said, the, increased, worker, productivity, and, corresponding, savings, in, wages, paid, would, offset, the, capital, cost, of, maintaining, two, shovels, during, the, second, industrial, revolution, around, 1900, heavy, equipment, such, as, crawler, excavators, became, available, shovels, known, as, entrenching, tools, were, made, by, the, british, in, 1908, they, were, used, by, the, germans, in, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii
