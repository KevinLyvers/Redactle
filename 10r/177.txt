waste, management, or, waste, disposal, includes, the, processes, and, actions, required, to, manage, waste, from, its, inception, to, its, final, disposal, this, includes, the, collection, transport, treatment, and, disposal, of, waste, together, with, monitoring, and, regulation, of, the, waste, management, process, and, waste, related, laws, technologies, and, economic, mechanisms, waste, can, either, be, solid, liquid, or, gases, and, each, type, has, different, methods, of, disposal, and, management, waste, management, deals, with, all, types, of, waste, including, industrial, biological, household, municipal, organic, biomedical, radioactive, wastes, in, some, cases, waste, can, pose, a, threat, to, human, health, health, issues, are, associated, with, the, entire, process, of, waste, management, health, issues, can, also, arise, indirectly, or, directly, directly, through, the, handling, of, solid, waste, and, indirectly, through, the, consumption, of, water, soil, and, food, waste, is, produced, by, human, activity, for, example, the, extraction, and, processing, of, raw, materials, waste, management, is, intended, to, reduce, the, adverse, effects, of, waste, on, human, health, the, environment, planetary, resources, and, aesthetics, the, aim, of, waste, management, is, to, reduce, the, dangerous, effects, of, such, waste, on, the, environment, and, human, health, a, big, part, of, waste, management, deals, with, municipal, solid, waste, which, is, created, by, industrial, commercial, and, household, activity, waste, management, practices, are, not, the, same, across, countries, developed, and, developing, nations, regions, urban, and, rural, areas, and, residential, and, industrial, sectors, can, all, take, different, approaches, proper, management, of, waste, is, important, for, building, sustainable, and, liveable, cities, but, it, remains, a, challenge, for, many, developing, countries, and, cities, a, report, found, that, effective, waste, management, is, relatively, expensive, usually, comprising, 20, 50, of, municipal, budgets, operating, this, essential, municipal, service, requires, integrated, systems, that, are, efficient, sustainable, and, socially, supported, a, large, portion, of, waste, management, practices, deal, with, municipal, solid, waste, msw, which, is, the, bulk, of, the, waste, that, is, created, by, household, industrial, and, commercial, activity, according, to, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, municipal, solid, waste, is, expected, to, reach, approximately, 3, 4, gt, by, 2050, however, policies, and, lawmaking, can, reduce, the, amount, of, waste, produced, in, different, areas, and, cities, of, the, world, measures, of, waste, management, include, measures, for, integrated, techno, economic, mechanisms, of, a, circular, economy, effective, disposal, facilities, export, and, import, control, and, optimal, sustainable, design, of, products, that, are, produced, in, the, first, systematic, review, of, the, scientific, evidence, around, global, waste, its, management, and, its, impact, on, human, health, and, life, authors, concluded, that, about, a, fourth, of, all, the, municipal, solid, terrestrial, waste, is, not, collected, and, an, additional, fourth, is, mismanaged, after, collection, often, being, burned, in, open, and, uncontrolled, fires, or, close, to, one, billion, tons, per, year, when, combined, they, also, found, that, broad, priority, areas, each, lack, a, high, quality, research, base, partly, due, to, the, absence, of, substantial, research, funding, which, motivated, scientists, often, require, electronic, waste, ewaste, includes, discarded, computer, monitors, motherboards, mobile, phones, and, chargers, compact, discs, cds, headphones, television, sets, air, conditioners, and, refrigerators, according, to, the, global, e, waste, monitor, 2017, india, generates, 2, million, tonnes, mte, of, e, waste, annually, and, ranks, fifth, among, the, e, waste, producing, countries, after, the, united, states, the, people, s, republic, of, china, japan, and, germany, effective, waste, management, involves, the, practice, of, 7r, r, efuse, r, educe, r, euse, r, epair, r, epurpose, r, ecycle, and, r, ecover, amongst, these, 7r, s, the, first, two, refuse, and, reduce, relate, to, the, non, creation, of, waste, by, refusing, to, buy, non, essential, products, and, by, reducing, consumption, the, next, two, reuse, and, repair, refer, to, increasing, the, usage, of, the, existing, product, with, or, without, the, substitution, of, certain, parts, of, the, product, repurpose, and, recycle, involve, maximum, usage, of, the, materials, used, in, the, product, and, recover, is, the, least, preferred, and, least, efficient, waste, management, practice, involving, the, recovery, of, embedded, energy, in, the, waste, material, for, example, burning, the, waste, to, produce, heat, and, electricity, from, heat, certain, non, biodegradable, products, are, also, dumped, away, as, disposal, and, this, is, not, a, waste, management, practice, the, waste, hierarchy, refers, to, the, 3, rs, reduce, reuse, and, recycle, which, classifies, waste, management, strategies, according, to, their, desirability, in, terms, of, waste, minimisation, the, waste, hierarchy, is, the, bedrock, of, most, waste, minimization, strategies, the, aim, of, the, waste, hierarchy, is, to, extract, the, maximum, practical, benefits, from, products, and, to, generate, the, minimum, amount, of, end, waste, see, resource, recovery, the, waste, hierarchy, is, represented, as, a, pyramid, because, the, basic, premise, is, that, policies, should, promote, measures, to, prevent, the, generation, of, waste, the, next, step, or, preferred, action, is, to, seek, alternative, uses, for, the, waste, that, has, been, generated, i, e, by, re, use, the, next, is, recycling, which, includes, composting, following, this, step, is, material, recovery, and, waste, to, energy, the, final, action, is, disposal, in, landfills, or, through, incineration, without, energy, recovery, this, last, step, is, the, final, resort, for, waste, that, has, not, been, prevented, diverted, or, recovered, the, waste, hierarchy, represents, the, progression, of, a, product, or, material, through, the, sequential, stages, of, the, pyramid, of, waste, management, the, hierarchy, represents, the, latter, parts, of, the, life, cycle, for, each, product, the, life, cycle, of, a, product, often, referred, to, as, the, product, lifecycle, encompasses, several, key, stages, that, begin, with, the, design, phase, and, proceed, through, manufacture, distribution, and, primary, use, after, these, initial, stages, the, product, moves, through, the, waste, hierarchy, s, stages, of, reduce, reuse, and, recycle, each, phase, in, this, lifecycle, presents, unique, opportunities, for, policy, intervention, allowing, stakeholders, to, rethink, the, necessity, of, the, product, redesign, it, to, minimize, its, waste, potential, and, extend, its, useful, life, during, the, design, phase, considerations, can, be, made, to, ensure, that, products, are, created, with, fewer, resources, are, more, durable, and, are, easier, to, repair, or, recycle, this, stage, is, critical, for, embedding, sustainability, into, the, product, from, the, outset, designers, can, select, materials, that, have, lower, environmental, impacts, and, create, products, that, require, less, energy, and, resources, to, produce, manufacturing, offers, another, crucial, point, for, reducing, waste, and, conserving, resources, innovations, in, production, processes, can, lead, to, more, efficient, use, of, materials, and, energy, while, also, minimizing, the, generation, of, by, products, and, emissions, adopting, cleaner, production, techniques, and, improving, manufacturing, efficiency, can, significantly, reduce, the, environmental, footprint, of, a, product, distribution, involves, the, logistics, of, getting, the, product, from, the, manufacturer, to, the, consumer, optimizing, this, stage, can, involve, reducing, packaging, choosing, more, sustainable, transportation, methods, and, improving, supply, chain, efficiencies, to, lower, the, overall, environmental, impact, efficient, logistics, planning, can, also, help, in, reducing, fuel, consumption, and, greenhouse, gas, emissions, associated, with, the, transport, of, goods, the, primary, use, phase, of, a, product, s, lifecycle, is, where, consumers, interact, with, the, product, policies, and, practices, that, encourage, responsible, use, regular, maintenance, and, the, proper, functioning, of, products, can, extend, their, lifespan, thus, reducing, the, need, for, frequent, replacements, and, decreasing, overall, waste, once, the, product, reaches, the, end, of, its, primary, use, it, enters, the, waste, hierarchy, s, stages, the, first, stage, reduction, involves, efforts, to, decrease, the, volume, and, toxicity, of, waste, generated, this, can, be, achieved, by, encouraging, consumers, to, buy, less, use, products, more, efficiently, and, choose, items, with, minimal, packaging, the, reuse, stage, encourages, finding, alternative, uses, for, products, whether, through, donation, resale, or, repurposing, reuse, extends, the, life, of, products, and, delays, their, entry, into, the, waste, stream, recycling, the, final, preferred, stage, involves, processing, materials, to, create, new, products, thus, closing, the, loop, in, the, material, lifecycle, effective, recycling, programs, can, significantly, reduce, the, need, for, virgin, materials, and, the, environmental, impacts, associated, with, extracting, and, processing, those, materials, product, life, cycle, analysis, lca, is, a, comprehensive, method, for, evaluating, the, environmental, impacts, associated, with, all, stages, of, a, product, s, life, by, systematically, assessing, these, impacts, lca, helps, identify, opportunities, to, improve, environmental, performance, and, resource, efficiency, through, optimizing, product, designs, manufacturing, processes, and, end, of, life, management, lca, aims, to, maximize, the, use, of, the, world, s, limited, resources, and, minimize, the, unnecessary, generation, of, waste, in, summary, the, product, lifecycle, framework, underscores, the, importance, of, a, holistic, approach, to, product, design, use, and, disposal, by, considering, each, stage, of, the, lifecycle, and, implementing, policies, and, practices, that, promote, sustainability, it, is, possible, to, significantly, reduce, the, environmental, impact, of, products, and, contribute, to, a, more, sustainable, future, resource, efficiency, reflects, the, understanding, that, global, economic, growth, and, development, can, not, be, sustained, at, current, production, and, consumption, patterns, globally, humanity, extracts, more, resources, to, produce, goods, than, the, planet, can, replenish, resource, efficiency, is, the, reduction, of, the, environmental, impact, from, the, production, and, consumption, of, these, goods, from, final, raw, material, extraction, to, the, last, use, and, disposal, the, polluter, pays, principle, mandates, that, the, polluting, parties, pay, for, the, impact, on, the, environment, with, respect, to, waste, management, this, generally, refers, to, the, requirement, for, a, waste, generator, to, pay, for, appropriate, disposal, of, the, unrecoverable, materials, throughout, most, of, history, the, amount, of, waste, generated, by, humans, was, insignificant, due, to, low, levels, of, population, density, and, exploitation, of, natural, resources, common, waste, produced, during, pre, modern, times, was, mainly, ashes, and, human, biodegradable, waste, and, these, were, released, back, into, the, ground, locally, with, minimum, environmental, impact, tools, made, out, of, wood, or, metal, were, generally, reused, or, passed, down, through, the, generations, however, some, civilizations, have, been, more, profligate, in, their, waste, output, than, others, in, particular, the, maya, of, central, america, had, a, fixed, monthly, ritual, in, which, the, people, of, the, village, would, gather, together, and, burn, their, rubbish, in, large, dumps, following, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, industrialisation, and, the, sustained, urban, growth, of, large, population, centres, in, england, the, buildup, of, waste, in, the, cities, caused, a, rapid, deterioration, in, levels, of, sanitation, and, the, general, quality, of, urban, life, the, streets, became, choked, with, filth, due, to, the, lack, of, waste, clearance, regulations, calls, for, the, establishment, of, municipal, authority, with, waste, removal, powers, occurred, as, early, as, 1751, when, corbyn, morris, in, london, proposed, that, as, the, preservation, of, the, health, of, the, people, is, of, great, importance, it, is, proposed, that, the, cleaning, of, this, city, should, be, put, under, one, uniform, public, management, and, all, the, filth, be, conveyed, by, the, thames, to, proper, distance, in, the, country, however, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 19th, century, spurred, by, increasingly, devastating, cholera, outbreaks, and, the, emergence, of, a, public, health, debate, that, the, first, legislation, on, the, issue, emerged, highly, influential, in, this, new, focus, was, the, report, the, sanitary, condition, of, the, labouring, population, in, 1842, of, the, social, reformer, edwin, chadwick, in, which, he, argued, for, the, importance, of, adequate, waste, removal, and, management, facilities, to, improve, the, health, and, wellbeing, of, the, city, s, population, in, the, uk, the, nuisance, removal, and, disease, prevention, act, of, 1846, began, what, was, to, be, a, steadily, evolving, process, of, the, provision, of, regulated, waste, management, in, london, the, metropolitan, board, of, works, was, the, first, citywide, authority, that, centralized, sanitation, regulation, for, the, rapidly, expanding, city, and, the, public, health, act, 1875, made, it, compulsory, for, every, household, to, deposit, their, weekly, waste, in, moveable, receptacles, for, disposal, the, first, concept, for, a, dustbin, in, the, ashanti, empire, by, the, 19th, century, there, existed, a, public, works, department, that, was, responsible, for, sanitation, in, kumasi, and, its, suburbs, they, kept, the, streets, clean, daily, and, commanded, civilians, to, keep, their, compounds, clean, and, weeded, the, dramatic, increase, in, waste, for, disposal, led, to, the, creation, of, the, first, incineration, plants, or, as, they, were, then, called, destructors, in, 1874, the, first, incinerator, was, built, in, nottingham, by, manlove, alliott, co, ltd, to, the, design, of, alfred, fryer, however, these, were, met, with, opposition, on, account, of, the, large, amounts, of, ash, they, produced, and, which, wafted, over, the, neighbouring, areas, similar, municipal, systems, of, waste, disposal, sprung, up, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, in, other, large, cities, of, europe, and, north, america, in, 1895, new, york, city, became, the, first, u, s, city, with, public, sector, garbage, management, early, garbage, removal, trucks, were, simply, open, bodied, dump, trucks, pulled, by, a, team, of, horses, they, became, motorized, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, first, closed, body, trucks, to, eliminate, odours, with, a, dumping, lever, mechanism, were, introduced, in, the, 1920s, in, britain, these, were, soon, equipped, with, hopper, mechanisms, where, the, scooper, was, loaded, at, floor, level, and, then, hoisted, mechanically, to, deposit, the, waste, in, the, truck, the, garwood, load, packer, was, the, first, truck, in, 1938, to, incorporate, a, hydraulic, compactor, waste, collection, methods, vary, widely, among, different, countries, and, regions, domestic, waste, collection, services, are, often, provided, by, local, government, authorities, or, by, private, companies, for, industrial, and, commercial, waste, some, areas, especially, those, in, less, developed, countries, do, not, have, formal, waste, collection, systems, curbside, collection, is, the, most, common, method, of, disposal, in, most, european, countries, canada, new, zealand, the, united, states, and, many, other, parts, of, the, developed, world, in, which, waste, is, collected, at, regular, intervals, by, specialised, trucks, this, is, often, associated, with, curb, side, waste, segregation, in, rural, areas, waste, may, need, to, be, taken, to, a, transfer, station, waste, collected, is, then, transported, to, an, appropriate, disposal, facility, in, some, areas, vacuum, collection, is, used, in, which, waste, is, transported, from, the, home, or, commercial, premises, by, vacuum, along, small, bore, tubes, systems, are, in, use, in, europe, and, north, america, in, some, jurisdictions, unsegregated, waste, is, collected, at, the, curb, side, or, from, waste, transfer, stations, and, then, sorted, into, recyclables, and, unusable, waste, such, systems, are, capable, of, sorting, large, volumes, of, solid, waste, salvaging, recyclables, and, turning, the, rest, into, bio, gas, and, soil, conditioners, in, san, francisco, the, local, government, established, its, mandatory, recycling, and, composting, ordinance, in, support, of, its, goal, of, zero, waste, by, 2020, requiring, everyone, in, the, city, to, keep, recyclables, and, compostables, out, of, the, landfill, the, three, streams, are, collected, with, the, curbside, fantastic, 3, bin, system, blue, for, recyclables, green, for, compostables, and, black, for, landfill, bound, materials, provided, to, residents, and, businesses, and, serviced, by, san, francisco, s, sole, refuse, hauler, recology, the, city, s, pay, as, you, throw, system, charges, customers, by, the, volume, of, landfill, bound, materials, which, provides, a, financial, incentive, to, separate, recyclables, and, compostables, from, other, discards, the, city, s, department, of, the, environment, s, zero, waste, program, has, led, the, city, to, achieve, 80, diversion, the, highest, diversion, rate, in, north, america, other, businesses, such, as, waste, industries, use, a, variety, of, colors, to, distinguish, between, trash, and, recycling, cans, in, addition, in, some, areas, of, the, world, the, disposal, of, municipal, solid, waste, can, cause, environmental, strain, due, to, official, not, having, benchmarks, that, help, measure, the, environmental, sustainability, of, certain, practices, this, is, the, separation, of, wet, waste, and, dry, waste, the, purpose, is, to, recycle, dry, waste, easily, and, to, use, wet, waste, as, compost, when, segregating, waste, the, amount, of, waste, that, gets, landfilled, reduces, considerably, resulting, in, lower, levels, of, air, and, water, pollution, importantly, waste, segregation, should, be, based, on, the, type, of, waste, and, the, most, appropriate, treatment, and, disposal, this, also, makes, it, easier, to, apply, different, processes, to, the, waste, like, composting, recycling, and, incineration, it, is, important, to, practice, waste, management, and, segregation, as, a, community, one, way, to, practice, waste, management, is, to, ensure, there, is, awareness, the, process, of, waste, segregation, should, be, explained, to, the, community, segregated, waste, is, also, often, cheaper, to, dispose, of, because, it, does, not, require, as, much, manual, sorting, as, mixed, waste, there, are, a, number, of, important, reasons, why, waste, segregation, is, important, such, as, legal, obligations, cost, savings, and, protection, of, human, health, and, the, environment, institutions, should, make, it, as, easy, as, possible, for, their, staff, to, correctly, segregate, their, waste, this, can, include, labelling, making, sure, there, are, enough, accessible, bins, and, clearly, indicating, why, segregation, is, so, important, labeling, is, especially, important, when, dealing, with, nuclear, waste, due, to, how, much, harm, to, human, health, the, excess, products, of, the, nuclear, cycle, can, cause, there, are, multiple, facets, of, waste, management, that, all, come, with, hazards, both, for, those, around, the, disposal, site, and, those, who, work, within, waste, management, exposure, to, waste, of, any, kind, can, be, detrimental, to, the, health, of, the, individual, primary, conditions, that, worsen, with, exposure, to, waste, are, asthma, and, tuberculosis, the, exposure, to, waste, on, an, average, individual, is, highly, dependent, on, the, conditions, around, them, those, in, less, developed, or, lower, income, areas, are, more, susceptible, to, the, effects, of, waste, product, especially, though, chemical, waste, the, range, of, hazards, due, to, waste, is, extremely, large, and, covers, every, type, of, waste, not, only, chemical, there, are, many, different, guidelines, to, follow, for, disposing, different, types, of, waste, the, hazards, of, incineration, are, a, large, risk, to, many, variable, communities, including, underdeveloped, countries, and, countries, or, cities, with, little, space, for, landfills, or, alternatives, burning, waste, is, an, easily, accessible, option, for, many, people, around, the, globe, it, has, even, been, encouraged, by, the, world, health, organization, when, there, is, no, other, option, because, burning, waste, is, rarely, paid, attention, to, its, effects, go, unnoticed, the, release, of, hazardous, materials, and, co2, when, waste, is, burned, is, the, largest, hazard, with, incineration, in, most, developed, countries, domestic, waste, disposal, is, funded, from, a, national, or, local, tax, which, may, be, related, to, income, or, property, values, commercial, and, industrial, waste, disposal, is, typically, charged, for, as, a, commercial, service, often, as, an, integrated, charge, which, includes, disposal, costs, this, practice, may, encourage, disposal, contractors, to, opt, for, the, cheapest, disposal, option, such, as, landfill, rather, than, the, environmentally, best, solution, such, as, re, use, and, recycling, financing, solid, waste, management, projects, can, be, overwhelming, for, the, city, government, especially, if, the, government, see, it, as, an, important, service, they, should, render, to, the, citizen, donors, and, grants, are, a, funding, mechanism, that, is, dependent, on, the, interest, of, the, donor, organization, as, much, as, it, is, a, good, way, to, develop, a, city, s, waste, management, infrastructure, attracting, and, utilizing, grants, is, solely, reliant, on, what, the, donor, considers, important, therefore, it, may, be, a, challenge, for, a, city, government, to, dictate, how, the, funds, should, be, distributed, among, the, various, aspect, of, waste, management, an, example, of, a, country, that, enforces, a, waste, tax, is, italy, the, tax, is, based, on, two, rates, fixed, and, variable, the, fixed, rate, is, based, on, the, size, of, the, house, while, the, variable, is, determined, by, the, number, of, people, living, in, the, house, the, world, bank, finances, and, advises, on, solid, waste, management, projects, using, a, diverse, suite, of, products, and, services, including, traditional, loans, results, based, financing, development, policy, financing, and, technical, advisory, world, bank, financed, waste, management, projects, usually, address, the, entire, lifecycle, of, waste, right, from, the, point, of, generation, to, collection, and, transportation, and, finally, treatment, and, disposal, a, landfill, is, a, site, for, the, disposal, of, waste, materials, it, is, the, oldest, and, most, common, form, of, waste, disposal, although, the, systematic, burial, of, waste, with, daily, intermediate, and, final, covers, only, began, in, the, 1940s, in, the, past, waste, was, simply, left, in, piles, or, thrown, into, pits, known, in, archeology, as, middens, incineration, is, a, disposal, method, in, which, solid, organic, wastes, are, subjected, to, combustion, so, as, to, convert, them, into, residue, and, gaseous, products, this, method, is, useful, for, the, disposal, of, both, municipal, solid, waste, and, solid, residue, from, wastewater, treatment, this, process, reduces, the, volume, of, solid, waste, by, 80, to, 95, percent, incineration, and, other, high, temperature, waste, treatment, systems, are, sometimes, described, as, thermal, treatment, incinerators, convert, waste, materials, into, heat, gas, steam, and, ash, incineration, is, carried, out, both, on, a, small, scale, by, individuals, and, on, a, large, scale, by, industry, it, is, used, to, dispose, of, solid, liquid, and, gaseous, waste, it, is, recognized, as, a, practical, method, of, disposing, of, certain, hazardous, waste, materials, such, as, biological, medical, waste, incineration, is, a, controversial, method, of, waste, disposal, due, to, issues, such, as, the, emission, of, gaseous, pollutants, including, substantial, quantities, of, carbon, dioxide, incineration, is, common, in, countries, such, as, japan, where, land, is, more, scarce, as, the, facilities, generally, do, not, require, as, much, area, as, landfills, waste, to, energy, wte, or, energy, from, waste, efw, are, broad, terms, for, facilities, that, burn, waste, in, a, furnace, or, boiler, to, generate, heat, steam, or, electricity, combustion, in, an, incinerator, is, not, always, perfect, and, there, have, been, concerns, about, pollutants, in, gaseous, emissions, from, incinerator, stacks, particular, concern, has, focused, on, some, very, persistent, organic, compounds, such, as, dioxins, furans, and, pahs, which, may, be, created, and, which, may, have, serious, environmental, consequences, and, some, heavy, metals, such, as, mercury, and, lead, which, can, be, volatilised, in, the, combustion, process, recycling, is, a, resource, recovery, practice, that, refers, to, the, collection, and, reuse, of, waste, materials, such, as, empty, beverage, containers, this, process, involves, breaking, down, and, reusing, materials, that, would, otherwise, be, gotten, rid, of, as, trash, there, are, numerous, benefits, of, recycling, and, with, so, many, new, technologies, making, even, more, materials, recyclable, it, is, possible, to, clean, up, the, earth, recycling, not, only, benefits, the, environment, but, also, positively, affects, the, economy, the, materials, from, which, the, items, are, made, can, be, made, into, new, products, materials, for, recycling, may, be, collected, separately, from, general, waste, using, dedicated, bins, and, collection, vehicles, a, procedure, called, kerbside, collection, in, some, communities, the, owner, of, the, waste, is, required, to, separate, the, materials, into, different, bins, e, g, for, paper, plastics, metals, prior, to, its, collection, in, other, communities, all, recyclable, materials, are, placed, in, a, single, bin, for, collection, and, the, sorting, is, handled, later, at, a, central, facility, the, latter, method, is, known, as, single, stream, recycling, the, most, common, consumer, products, recycled, include, aluminium, such, as, beverage, cans, copper, such, as, wire, steel, from, food, and, aerosol, cans, old, steel, furnishings, or, equipment, rubber, tyres, polyethylene, and, pet, bottles, glass, bottles, and, jars, paperboard, cartons, newspapers, magazines, and, light, paper, and, corrugated, fiberboard, boxes, pvc, ldpe, pp, and, ps, see, resin, identification, code, are, also, recyclable, these, items, are, usually, composed, of, a, single, type, of, material, making, them, relatively, easy, to, recycle, into, new, products, the, recycling, of, complex, products, such, as, computers, and, electronic, equipment, is, more, difficult, due, to, the, additional, dismantling, and, separation, required, the, type, of, material, accepted, for, recycling, varies, by, city, and, country, each, city, and, country, has, different, recycling, programs, in, place, that, can, handle, the, various, types, of, recyclable, materials, however, certain, variation, in, acceptance, is, reflected, in, the, resale, value, of, the, material, once, it, is, reprocessed, some, of, the, types, of, recycling, include, waste, paper, and, cardboard, plastic, recycling, metal, recycling, electronic, devices, wood, recycling, glass, recycling, cloth, and, textile, and, so, many, more, in, july, 2017, the, chinese, government, announced, an, import, ban, of, 24, categories, of, recyclables, and, solid, waste, including, plastic, textiles, and, mixed, paper, placing, tremendous, impact, on, developed, countries, globally, which, exported, directly, or, indirectly, to, china, recoverable, materials, that, are, organic, in, nature, such, as, plant, material, food, scraps, and, paper, products, can, be, recovered, through, composting, and, digestion, processes, to, decompose, the, organic, matter, the, resulting, organic, material, is, then, recycled, as, mulch, or, compost, for, agricultural, or, landscaping, purposes, in, addition, waste, gas, from, the, process, such, as, methane, can, be, captured, and, used, for, generating, electricity, and, heat, chp, cogeneration, maximising, efficiencies, there, are, different, types, of, composting, and, digestion, methods, and, technologies, they, vary, in, complexity, from, simple, home, compost, heaps, to, large, scale, industrial, digestion, of, mixed, domestic, waste, the, different, methods, of, biological, decomposition, are, classified, as, aerobic, or, anaerobic, methods, some, methods, use, the, hybrids, of, these, two, methods, the, anaerobic, digestion, of, the, organic, fraction, of, solid, waste, is, more, environmentally, effective, than, landfill, or, incineration, the, intention, of, biological, processing, in, waste, management, is, to, control, and, accelerate, the, natural, process, of, decomposition, of, organic, matter, see, resource, recovery, energy, recovery, from, waste, is, the, conversion, of, non, recyclable, waste, materials, into, usable, heat, electricity, or, fuel, through, a, variety, of, processes, including, combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic, digestion, and, landfill, gas, recovery, this, process, is, often, called, waste, to, energy, energy, recovery, from, waste, is, part, of, the, non, hazardous, waste, management, hierarchy, using, energy, recovery, to, convert, non, recyclable, waste, materials, into, electricity, and, heat, generates, a, renewable, energy, source, and, can, reduce, carbon, emissions, by, offsetting, the, need, for, energy, from, fossil, sources, as, well, as, reduce, methane, generation, from, landfills, globally, waste, to, energy, accounts, for, 16, of, waste, management, the, energy, content, of, waste, products, can, be, harnessed, directly, by, using, them, as, a, direct, combustion, fuel, or, indirectly, by, processing, them, into, another, type, of, fuel, thermal, treatment, ranges, from, using, waste, as, a, fuel, source, for, cooking, or, heating, and, the, use, of, the, gas, fuel, see, above, to, fuel, for, boilers, to, generate, steam, and, electricity, in, a, turbine, pyrolysis, and, gasification, are, two, related, forms, of, thermal, treatment, where, waste, materials, are, heated, to, high, temperatures, with, limited, oxygen, availability, the, process, usually, occurs, in, a, sealed, vessel, under, high, pressure, pyrolysis, of, solid, waste, converts, the, material, into, solid, liquid, and, gas, products, the, liquid, and, gas, can, be, burnt, to, produce, energy, or, refined, into, other, chemical, products, chemical, refinery, the, solid, residue, char, can, be, further, refined, into, products, such, as, activated, carbon, gasification, and, advanced, plasma, arc, gasification, are, used, to, convert, organic, materials, directly, into, a, synthetic, gas, syngas, composed, of, carbon, monoxide, and, hydrogen, the, gas, is, then, burnt, to, produce, electricity, and, steam, an, alternative, to, pyrolysis, is, high, temperature, and, pressure, supercritical, water, decomposition, hydrothermal, monophasic, oxidation, pyrolysis, is, often, used, to, convert, many, types, of, domestic, and, industrial, residues, into, a, recovered, fuel, different, types, of, waste, input, such, as, plant, waste, food, waste, tyres, placed, in, the, pyrolysis, process, potentially, yield, an, alternative, to, fossil, fuels, pyrolysis, is, a, process, of, thermo, chemical, decomposition, of, organic, materials, by, heat, in, the, absence, of, stoichiometric, quantities, of, oxygen, the, decomposition, produces, various, hydrocarbon, gases, during, pyrolysis, the, molecules, of, an, object, vibrate, at, high, frequencies, to, the, extent, that, molecules, start, breaking, down, the, rate, of, pyrolysis, increases, with, temperature, in, industrial, applications, temperatures, are, above, 430, c, 800, f, slow, pyrolysis, produces, gases, and, solid, charcoal, pyrolysis, holds, promise, for, conversion, of, waste, biomass, into, useful, liquid, fuel, pyrolysis, of, waste, wood, and, plastics, can, potentially, produce, fuel, the, solids, left, from, pyrolysis, contain, metals, glass, sand, and, pyrolysis, coke, which, does, not, convert, to, gas, compared, to, the, process, of, incineration, certain, types, of, pyrolysis, processes, release, less, harmful, by, products, that, contain, alkali, metals, sulphur, and, chlorine, however, pyrolysis, of, some, waste, yields, gases, which, impact, the, environment, such, as, hcl, and, so, 2, resource, recovery, is, the, systematic, diversion, of, waste, which, was, intended, for, disposal, for, a, specific, next, use, it, is, the, processing, of, recyclables, to, extract, or, recover, materials, and, resources, or, convert, to, energy, these, activities, are, performed, at, a, resource, recovery, facility, resource, recovery, is, not, only, environmentally, important, but, it, is, also, cost, effective, it, decreases, the, amount, of, waste, for, disposal, saves, space, in, landfills, and, conserves, natural, resources, resource, recovery, an, alternative, approach, to, traditional, waste, management, utilizes, life, cycle, analysis, lca, to, evaluate, and, optimize, waste, handling, strategies, comprehensive, studies, focusing, on, mixed, municipal, solid, waste, msw, have, identified, a, preferred, pathway, for, maximizing, resource, efficiency, and, minimizing, environmental, impact, including, effective, waste, administration, and, management, source, separation, of, waste, materials, efficient, collection, systems, reuse, and, recycling, of, non, organic, fractions, and, processing, of, organic, material, through, anaerobic, digestion, as, an, example, of, how, resource, recycling, can, be, beneficial, many, items, thrown, away, contain, metals, that, can, be, recycled, to, create, a, profit, such, as, the, components, in, circuit, boards, wood, chippings, in, pallets, and, other, packaging, materials, can, be, recycled, into, useful, products, for, horticulture, the, recycled, chips, can, cover, paths, walkways, or, arena, surfaces, application, of, rational, and, consistent, waste, management, practices, can, yield, a, range, of, benefits, including, waste, valorization, beneficial, reuse, beneficial, use, value, recovery, or, waste, reclamation, is, the, process, of, waste, products, or, residues, from, an, economic, process, being, valorized, given, economic, value, by, reuse, or, recycling, in, order, to, create, economically, useful, materials, the, term, comes, from, practices, in, sustainable, manufacturing, and, economics, industrial, ecology, and, waste, management, the, term, is, usually, applied, in, industrial, processes, where, residue, from, creating, or, processing, one, good, is, used, as, a, raw, material, or, energy, feedstock, for, another, industrial, process, industrial, wastes, in, particular, are, good, candidates, for, valorization, because, they, tend, to, be, more, consistent, and, predictable, than, other, waste, such, as, household, waste, liquid, waste, is, an, important, category, of, waste, management, because, it, is, so, difficult, to, deal, with, unlike, solid, wastes, liquid, wastes, cannot, be, easily, picked, up, and, removed, from, an, environment, liquid, wastes, spread, out, and, easily, pollute, other, sources, of, liquid, if, brought, into, contact, this, type, of, waste, also, soaks, into, objects, like, soil, and, groundwater, this, in, turn, carries, over, to, pollute, the, plants, the, animals, in, the, ecosystem, as, well, as, the, humans, within, the, area, of, the, pollution, industrial, wastewater, treatment, describes, the, processes, used, for, treating, wastewater, that, is, produced, by, industries, as, an, undesirable, by, product, after, treatment, the, treated, industrial, wastewater, or, effluent, may, be, reused, or, released, to, a, sanitary, sewer, or, to, a, surface, water, in, the, environment, some, industrial, facilities, generate, wastewater, that, can, be, treated, in, sewage, treatment, plants, most, industrial, processes, such, as, petroleum, refineries, chemical, and, petrochemical, plants, have, their, own, specialized, facilities, to, treat, their, wastewaters, so, that, the, pollutant, concentrations, in, the, treated, wastewater, comply, with, the, regulations, regarding, disposal, of, wastewaters, into, sewers, or, into, rivers, lakes, or, oceans, 1412, this, applies, to, industries, that, generate, wastewater, with, high, concentrations, of, organic, matter, e, g, oil, and, grease, toxic, pollutants, e, g, heavy, metals, volatile, organic, compounds, or, nutrients, such, as, ammonia, 180, some, industries, install, a, pre, treatment, system, to, remove, some, pollutants, e, g, toxic, compounds, and, then, discharge, the, partially, treated, wastewater, to, the, municipal, sewer, system, 60, sewage, sludge, treatment, describes, the, processes, used, to, manage, and, dispose, of, sewage, sludge, produced, during, sewage, treatment, sludge, treatment, is, focused, on, reducing, sludge, weight, and, volume, to, reduce, transportation, and, disposal, costs, and, on, reducing, potential, health, risks, of, disposal, options, water, removal, is, the, primary, means, of, weight, and, volume, reduction, while, pathogen, destruction, is, frequently, accomplished, through, heating, during, thermophilic, digestion, composting, or, incineration, the, choice, of, a, sludge, treatment, method, depends, on, the, volume, of, sludge, generated, and, comparison, of, treatment, costs, required, for, available, disposal, options, air, drying, and, composting, may, be, attractive, to, rural, communities, while, limited, land, availability, may, make, aerobic, digestion, and, mechanical, dewatering, preferable, for, cities, and, economies, of, scale, may, encourage, energy, recovery, alternatives, in, metropolitan, areas, sludge, is, mostly, water, with, some, amounts, of, solid, material, removed, from, liquid, sewage, primary, sludge, includes, settleable, solids, removed, during, primary, treatment, in, primary, clarifiers, secondary, sludge, is, sludge, separated, in, secondary, clarifiers, that, are, used, in, secondary, treatment, bioreactors, or, processes, using, inorganic, oxidizing, agents, in, intensive, sewage, treatment, processes, the, sludge, produced, needs, to, be, removed, from, the, liquid, line, on, a, continuous, basis, because, the, volumes, of, the, tanks, in, the, liquid, line, have, insufficient, volume, to, store, sludge, this, is, done, in, order, to, keep, the, treatment, processes, compact, and, in, balance, production, of, sludge, approximately, equal, to, the, removal, of, sludge, the, sludge, removed, from, the, liquid, line, goes, to, the, sludge, treatment, line, aerobic, processes, such, as, the, activated, sludge, process, tend, to, produce, more, sludge, compared, with, anaerobic, processes, on, the, other, hand, in, extensive, natural, treatment, processes, such, as, ponds, and, constructed, wetlands, the, produced, sludge, remains, accumulated, in, the, treatment, units, liquid, line, and, is, only, removed, after, several, years, of, operation, sludge, treatment, options, depend, on, the, amount, of, solids, generated, and, other, site, specific, conditions, composting, is, most, often, applied, to, small, scale, plants, with, aerobic, digestion, for, mid, sized, operations, and, anaerobic, digestion, for, the, larger, scale, operations, the, sludge, is, sometimes, passed, through, a, so, called, pre, thickener, which, de, waters, the, sludge, types, of, pre, thickeners, include, centrifugal, sludge, thickeners, rotary, drum, sludge, thickeners, and, belt, filter, presses, dewatered, sludge, may, be, incinerated, or, transported, offsite, for, disposal, in, a, landfill, or, use, as, an, agricultural, soil, amendment, an, important, method, of, waste, management, is, the, prevention, of, waste, material, being, created, also, known, as, waste, reduction, waste, minimization, is, reducing, the, quantity, of, hazardous, wastes, achieved, through, a, thorough, application, of, innovative, or, alternative, procedures, methods, of, avoidance, include, reuse, of, second, hand, products, repairing, broken, items, instead, of, buying, new, ones, designing, products, to, be, refillable, or, reusable, such, as, cotton, instead, of, plastic, shopping, bags, encouraging, consumers, to, avoid, using, disposable, products, such, as, disposable, cutlery, removing, any, food, liquid, remains, from, cans, and, packaging, and, designing, products, that, use, less, material, to, achieve, the, same, purpose, for, example, lightweighting, of, beverage, cans, the, global, waste, trade, is, the, international, trade, of, waste, between, countries, for, further, treatment, disposal, or, recycling, toxic, or, hazardous, wastes, are, often, imported, by, developing, countries, from, developed, countries, the, world, bank, report, what, a, waste, a, global, review, of, solid, waste, management, describes, the, amount, of, solid, waste, produced, in, a, given, country, specifically, countries, which, produce, more, solid, waste, are, more, economically, developed, and, more, industrialized, the, report, explains, that, generally, the, higher, the, economic, development, and, rate, of, urbanization, the, greater, the, amount, of, solid, waste, produced, therefore, countries, in, the, global, north, which, are, more, economically, developed, and, urbanized, produce, more, solid, waste, than, global, south, countries, current, international, trade, flows, of, waste, follow, a, pattern, of, waste, being, produced, in, the, global, north, and, being, exported, to, and, disposed, of, in, the, global, south, multiple, factors, affect, which, countries, produce, waste, and, at, what, magnitude, including, geographic, location, degree, of, industrialization, and, level, of, integration, into, the, global, economy, neoliberalism, removes, economics, and, markets, from, the, discourse, of, social, obligations, and, social, costs, as, a, policy, and, political, project, neoliberalism, is, wedded, to, the, privatization, of, public, services, selling, off, of, state, functions, deregulation, of, finance, and, labor, elimination, of, the, welfare, state, and, unions, liberalization, of, trade, in, goods, and, capital, investment, and, the, marketization, and, commodification, of, society, areas, with, developing, economies, often, experience, exhausted, waste, collection, services, and, inadequately, managed, and, uncontrolled, dumpsites, the, problems, are, worsening, problems, with, governance, complicate, the, situation, waste, management, in, these, countries, and, cities, is, an, ongoing, challenge, due, to, weak, institutions, chronic, under, resourcing, and, rapid, urbanization, all, of, these, challenges, along, with, the, lack, of, understanding, of, different, factors, that, contribute, to, the, hierarchy, of, waste, management, affect, the, treatment, of, waste, in, developing, countries, waste, management, activities, are, usually, carried, out, by, the, poor, for, their, survival, it, has, been, estimated, that, 2, of, the, population, in, asia, latin, america, and, africa, are, dependent, on, waste, for, their, livelihood, family, organized, or, individual, manual, scavengers, are, often, involved, with, waste, management, practices, with, very, little, supportive, network, and, facilities, with, increased, risk, of, health, effects, additionally, this, practice, prevents, their, children, from, further, education, the, participation, level, of, most, citizens, in, waste, management, is, very, low, residents, in, urban, areas, are, not, actively, involved, in, the, process, of, waste, management, traditionally, the, waste, management, industry, has, been, a, late, adopter, of, new, technologies, such, as, rfid, radio, frequency, identification, tags, gps, and, integrated, software, packages, which, enable, better, quality, data, to, be, collected, without, the, use, of, estimation, or, manual, data, entry, this, technology, has, been, used, widely, by, many, organizations, in, some, industrialized, countries, radiofrequency, identification, is, a, tagging, system, for, automatic, identification, of, recyclable, components, of, municipal, solid, waste, streams, smart, waste, management, has, been, implemented, in, several, cities, including, san, francisco, varde, or, madrid, waste, containers, are, equipped, with, level, sensors, when, the, container, is, almost, full, the, sensor, warns, the, pickup, truck, which, can, thus, trace, its, route, servicing, the, fullest, containers, and, skipping, the, emptiest, ones, the, global, waste, management, outlook, 2024, supported, by, the, environment, fund, unep, s, core, financial, fund, and, jointly, published, with, the, international, solid, waste, association, iswa, provides, a, comprehensive, update, on, the, trajectory, of, global, waste, generation, and, the, escalating, costs, of, waste, management, since, 2018, the, report, predicts, municipal, solid, waste, to, rise, from, 2, 3, billion, tonnes, in, 2023, to, 3, 8, billion, tonnes, by, 2050, the, direct, global, cost, of, waste, management, was, around, usd, 252, billion, in, 2020, which, could, soar, to, usd, 640, 3, billion, annually, by, 2050, if, current, practices, continue, without, reform, incorporating, life, cycle, assessments, the, report, contrasts, scenarios, from, maintaining, the, status, quo, to, fully, adopting, zero, waste, and, circular, economy, principles, it, indicates, that, effective, waste, prevention, and, management, could, cap, annual, costs, at, usd, 270, 2, billion, by, 2050, while, a, circular, economy, approach, could, transform, the, sector, into, a, net, positive, offering, a, potential, annual, gain, of, usd, 108, 5, billion, to, prevent, the, direst, outcomes, the, report, calls, for, immediate, action, across, multiple, sectors, including, development, banks, governments, municipalities, producers, retailers, and, citizens, providing, targeted, strategies, for, waste, reduction, and, improved, management, practices, municipal, solid, waste, generation, shows, spatiotemporal, variation, in, spatial, distribution, the, point, sources, in, eastern, coastal, regions, are, quite, different, guangdong, shanghai, and, tianjin, produced, msw, of, 30, 35, 7, 85, and, 2, 95, mt, respectively, in, temporal, distribution, during, 2009, 2018, fujian, province, showed, a, 123, increase, in, msw, generation, while, liaoning, province, showed, only, 7, increase, whereas, shanghai, special, zone, had, a, decline, of, 11, after, 2013, msw, composition, characteristics, are, complicated, the, major, components, such, as, kitchen, waste, paper, and, rubber, plastics, in, different, eastern, coastal, cities, have, fluctuation, in, the, range, of, 52, 8, 65, 3, 3, 5, 11, 9, and, 9, 9, 19, 1, respectively, treatment, rate, of, consumption, waste, is, up, to, 99, with, a, sum, of, 52, landfill, 45, incineration, and, 3, composting, technologies, indicating, that, landfill, still, dominates, msw, treatment, morocco, has, seen, benefits, from, implementing, a, 300, million, sanitary, landfill, system, while, it, might, appear, to, be, a, costly, investment, the, country, s, government, predicts, that, it, has, saved, them, another, 440, million, in, damages, or, consequences, of, failing, to, dispose, of, waste, properly, san, francisco, started, to, make, changes, to, their, waste, management, policies, in, 2009, with, the, expectation, to, be, zero, waste, by, 2030, council, made, changes, such, as, making, recycling, and, composting, a, mandatory, practice, for, businesses, and, individuals, banning, styrofoam, and, plastic, bags, putting, charges, on, paper, bags, and, increasing, garbage, collection, rates, businesses, are, fiscally, rewarded, for, correct, disposal, of, recycling, and, composting, and, taxed, for, incorrect, disposal, besides, these, policies, the, waste, bins, were, manufactured, in, various, sizes, the, compost, bin, is, the, largest, the, recycling, bin, is, second, and, the, garbage, bin, is, the, smallest, this, encourages, individuals, to, sort, their, waste, thoughtfully, with, respect, to, the, sizes, these, systems, are, working, because, they, were, able, to, divert, 80, of, waste, from, the, landfill, which, is, the, highest, rate, of, any, major, u, s, city, despite, all, these, changes, debbie, raphael, director, of, the, san, francisco, department, of, the, environment, states, that, zero, waste, is, still, not, achievable, until, all, products, are, designed, differently, to, be, able, to, be, recycled, or, compostable, waste, management, policy, in, england, is, the, responsibility, of, the, department, of, the, environment, food, and, rural, affairs, defra, in, england, the, waste, management, plan, for, england, presents, a, compilation, of, waste, management, policies, in, the, devolved, nations, such, as, scotland, waste, management, policy, is, a, responsibility, of, their, own, respective, departments, in, zambia, asaza, is, a, community, based, organization, whose, principal, purpose, is, to, complement, the, efforts, of, the, government, and, cooperating, partners, to, uplift, the, standard, of, living, for, disadvantaged, communities, the, project, s, main, objective, is, to, minimize, the, problem, of, indiscriminate, littering, which, leads, to, land, degradation, and, pollution, of, the, environment, asaza, is, also, at, the, same, time, helping, alleviate, the, problems, of, unemployment, and, poverty, through, income, generation, and, payment, of, participants, women, and, unskilled, youths, a, record, 53, 6, million, metric, tonnes, mt, of, electronic, waste, was, generated, worldwide, in, 2019, up, 21, percent, in, just, five, years, according, to, the, un, s, global, e, waste, monitor, 2020, released, today, the, new, report, also, predicts, global, e, waste, discarded, products, with, a, battery, or, plug, will, reach, 74, mt, by, 2030, almost, a, doubling, of, e, waste, in, just, 16, years, this, makes, e, waste, the, world, s, fastest, growing, domestic, waste, stream, fueled, mainly, by, higher, consumption, rates, of, electric, and, electronic, equipment, short, life, cycles, and, few, options, for, repair, only, 17, 4, percent, of, 2019, s, e, waste, was, collected, and, recycled, this, means, that, gold, silver, copper, platinum, and, other, high, value, recoverable, materials, conservatively, valued, at, us, 57, billion, a, sum, greater, than, the, gross, domestic, product, of, most, countries, were, mostly, dumped, or, burned, rather, than, being, collected, for, treatment, and, reuse, e, wasteis, predicted, to, double, by, 2050, the, transboundary, e, waste, flows, monitor, quantified, that, 5, 1, mt, just, below, 10, percent, of, the, total, amount, of, global, e, waste, 53, 6, mt, crossed, country, borders, in, 2019, to, better, understand, the, implication, of, transboundary, movement, this, study, categorizes, the, transboundary, movement, of, e, waste, into, controlled, and, uncontrolled, movements, and, also, considers, both, the, receiving, and, sending, regions, related, scientific, journals, in, this, area, include
