a, microwave, oven, or, simply, microwave, is, an, electric, oven, that, heats, and, cooks, food, by, exposing, it, to, electromagnetic, radiation, in, the, microwave, frequency, range, this, induces, polar, molecules, in, the, food, to, vibrate, and, produce, thermal, energy, in, a, process, known, as, dielectric, heating, microwave, ovens, heat, foods, quickly, and, efficiently, because, excitation, is, fairly, uniform, in, the, outer, 25, 38, mm, 1, 1, 5, inches, of, a, homogeneous, high, water, content, food, item, the, development, of, the, cavity, magnetron, in, the, united, kingdom, made, possible, the, production, of, electromagnetic, waves, of, a, small, enough, wavelength, microwaves, to, efficiently, heat, up, water, molecules, american, electrical, engineer, percy, spencer, is, generally, credited, with, inventing, the, modern, microwave, oven, after, world, war, ii, from, radar, technology, developed, during, the, war, named, the, radarange, it, was, first, sold, in, 1947, raytheon, later, licensed, its, patents, for, a, home, use, microwave, oven, that, was, introduced, by, tappan, in, 1955, but, it, was, still, too, large, and, expensive, for, general, home, use, sharp, corporation, introduced, the, first, microwave, oven, with, a, turntable, between, 1964, and, 1966, the, countertop, microwave, oven, was, introduced, in, 1967, by, the, amana, corporation, after, microwave, ovens, became, affordable, for, residential, use, in, the, late, 1970s, their, use, spread, into, commercial, and, residential, kitchens, around, the, world, and, prices, fell, rapidly, during, the, 1980s, in, addition, to, cooking, food, microwave, ovens, are, used, for, heating, in, many, industrial, processes, microwave, ovens, are, a, common, kitchen, appliance, and, are, popular, for, reheating, previously, cooked, foods, and, cooking, a, variety, of, foods, they, rapidly, heat, foods, which, can, easily, burn, or, turn, lumpy, if, cooked, in, conventional, pans, such, as, hot, butter, fats, chocolate, or, porridge, microwave, ovens, usually, do, not, directly, brown, or, caramelize, food, since, they, rarely, attain, the, necessary, temperature, to, produce, maillard, reactions, exceptions, occur, in, cases, where, the, oven, is, used, to, heat, frying, oil, and, other, oily, items, such, as, bacon, which, attain, far, higher, temperatures, than, that, of, boiling, water, microwave, ovens, have, a, limited, role, in, professional, cooking, because, the, boiling, range, temperatures, of, a, microwave, oven, do, not, produce, the, flavorful, chemical, reactions, that, frying, browning, or, baking, at, a, higher, temperature, produces, however, such, high, heat, sources, can, be, added, to, microwave, ovens, in, the, form, of, a, convection, microwave, oven, the, exploitation, of, high, frequency, radio, waves, for, heating, substances, was, made, possible, by, the, development, of, vacuum, tube, radio, transmitters, around, 1920, by, 1930, the, application, of, short, waves, to, heat, human, tissue, had, developed, into, the, medical, therapy, of, diathermy, at, the, 1933, chicago, world, s, fair, westinghouse, demonstrated, the, cooking, of, foods, between, two, metal, plates, attached, to, a, 10, kw, 60, mhz, shortwave, transmitter, the, westinghouse, team, led, by, i, f, mouromtseff, found, that, foods, like, steaks, and, potatoes, could, be, cooked, in, minutes, the, 1937, united, states, patent, application, by, bell, laboratories, states, this, invention, relates, to, heating, systems, for, dielectric, materials, and, the, object, of, the, invention, is, to, heat, such, materials, uniformly, and, substantially, simultaneously, throughout, their, mass, it, has, been, proposed, therefore, to, heat, such, materials, simultaneously, throughout, their, mass, by, means, of, the, dielectric, loss, produced, in, them, when, they, are, subjected, to, a, high, voltage, high, frequency, field, however, lower, frequency, dielectric, heating, as, described, in, the, aforementioned, patent, is, like, induction, heating, an, electromagnetic, heating, effect, the, result, of, the, so, called, near, field, effects, that, exist, in, an, electromagnetic, cavity, that, is, small, compared, with, the, wavelength, of, the, electromagnetic, field, this, patent, proposed, radio, frequency, heating, at, 10, to, 20, megahertz, wavelength, 30, to, 15, meters, respectively, heating, from, microwaves, that, have, a, wavelength, that, is, small, relative, to, the, cavity, as, in, a, modern, microwave, oven, is, due, to, far, field, effects, that, are, due, to, classical, electromagnetic, radiation, that, describes, freely, propagating, light, and, microwaves, suitably, far, from, their, source, nevertheless, the, primary, heating, effect, of, all, types, of, electromagnetic, fields, at, both, radio, and, microwave, frequencies, occurs, via, the, dielectric, heating, effect, as, polarized, molecules, are, affected, by, a, rapidly, alternating, electric, field, the, invention, of, the, cavity, magnetron, made, possible, the, production, of, electromagnetic, waves, of, a, small, enough, wavelength, microwaves, the, cavity, magnetron, was, a, crucial, component, in, the, development, of, short, wavelength, radar, during, world, war, ii, in, 1937, 1940, a, multi, cavity, magnetron, was, built, by, british, physicist, sir, john, turton, randall, frse, and, coworkers, for, the, british, and, american, military, radar, installations, in, world, war, ii, a, higher, powered, microwave, generator, that, worked, at, shorter, wavelengths, was, needed, and, in, 1940, at, the, university, of, birmingham, in, england, randall, and, harry, boot, produced, a, working, prototype, they, invented, a, valve, that, could, produce, pulses, of, microwave, radio, energy, at, a, wavelength, of, 10, cm, an, unprecedented, discovery, sir, henry, tizard, traveled, to, the, us, in, late, september, 1940, to, offer, britain, s, most, valuable, technical, secrets, including, the, cavity, magnetron, in, exchange, for, us, financial, and, industrial, support, see, tizard, mission, an, early, 6, kw, version, built, in, england, by, the, general, electric, company, research, laboratories, wembley, london, was, given, to, the, u, s, government, in, september, 1940, the, cavity, magnetron, was, later, described, by, american, historian, james, phinney, baxter, iii, as, he, most, valuable, cargo, ever, brought, to, our, shores, contracts, were, awarded, to, raytheon, and, other, companies, for, the, mass, production, of, the, cavity, magnetron, in, 1945, the, heating, effect, of, a, high, power, microwave, beam, was, accidentally, discovered, by, percy, spencer, an, american, self, taught, engineer, from, howland, maine, employed, by, raytheon, at, the, time, he, noticed, that, microwaves, from, an, active, radar, set, he, was, working, on, started, to, melt, a, mr, goodbar, candy, bar, he, had, in, his, pocket, the, first, food, deliberately, cooked, with, spencer, s, microwave, oven, was, popcorn, and, the, second, was, an, egg, which, exploded, in, the, face, of, one, of, the, experimenters, to, verify, his, finding, spencer, created, a, high, density, electromagnetic, field, by, feeding, microwave, power, from, a, magnetron, into, a, metal, box, from, which, it, had, no, way, to, escape, when, food, was, placed, in, the, box, with, the, microwave, energy, the, temperature, of, the, food, rose, rapidly, on, 8, october, 1945, raytheon, filed, a, united, states, patent, application, for, spencer, s, microwave, cooking, process, and, an, oven, that, heated, food, using, microwave, energy, from, a, magnetron, was, soon, placed, in, a, boston, restaurant, for, testing, another, early, discovery, of, microwave, oven, technology, was, by, british, scientists, including, james, lovelock, who, in, the, 1950s, used, it, to, reanimate, cryogenically, frozen, hamsters, in, 1947, raytheon, built, the, radarange, the, first, commercially, available, microwave, oven, it, was, almost, 1, 8, metres, 5, ft, 11, in, tall, weighed, 340, kilograms, 750, lb, and, cost, about, us, 5, 000, 68, 000, in, 2023, dollars, each, it, consumed, 3, kilowatts, about, three, times, as, much, as, today, s, microwave, ovens, and, was, water, cooled, the, name, was, the, winning, entry, in, an, employee, contest, an, early, radarange, was, installed, and, remains, in, the, galley, of, the, nuclear, powered, passenger, cargo, ship, ns, savannah, an, early, commercial, model, introduced, in, 1954, consumed, 1, 6, kilowatts, and, sold, for, us, 2, 000, to, us, 3, 000, 23, 000, to, 34, 000, in, 2023, dollars, raytheon, licensed, its, technology, to, the, tappan, stove, company, of, mansfield, ohio, in, 1952, under, contract, to, whirlpool, westinghouse, and, other, major, appliance, manufacturers, looking, to, add, matching, microwave, ovens, to, their, conventional, oven, line, tappan, produced, several, variations, of, their, built, in, model, from, roughly, 1955, to, 1960, due, to, maintenance, some, units, were, water, cooled, in, built, requirement, and, cost, us, 1, 295, 15, 000, in, 2023, dollars, sales, were, limited, japan, s, sharp, corporation, began, manufacturing, microwave, ovens, in, 1961, between, 1964, and, 1966, sharp, introduced, the, first, microwave, oven, with, a, turntable, an, alternative, means, to, promote, more, even, heating, of, food, in, 1965, raytheon, looking, to, expand, their, radarange, technology, into, the, home, market, acquired, amana, to, provide, more, manufacturing, capability, in, 1967, they, introduced, the, first, popular, home, model, the, countertop, radarange, at, a, price, of, us, 495, 5, 000, in, 2023, dollars, unlike, the, sharp, models, a, motor, driven, mode, stirrer, in, the, top, of, the, oven, cavity, rotated, allowing, the, food, to, remain, stationary, in, the, 1960s, litton, bought, studebaker, s, franklin, manufacturing, assets, which, had, been, manufacturing, magnetrons, and, building, and, selling, microwave, ovens, similar, to, the, radarange, litton, developed, a, new, configuration, of, the, microwave, oven, the, short, wide, shape, that, is, now, common, the, magnetron, feed, was, also, unique, this, resulted, in, an, oven, that, could, survive, a, no, load, condition, an, empty, microwave, oven, where, there, is, nothing, to, absorb, the, microwaves, the, new, oven, was, shown, at, a, trade, show, in, chicago, and, helped, begin, a, rapid, growth, of, the, market, for, home, microwave, ovens, sales, volume, of, 40, 000, units, for, the, u, s, industry, in, 1970, grew, to, one, million, by, 1975, market, penetration, was, even, faster, in, japan, due, to, a, less, expensive, re, engineered, magnetron, several, other, companies, joined, in, the, market, and, for, a, time, most, systems, were, built, by, defence, contractors, who, were, most, familiar, with, the, magnetron, litton, was, particularly, well, known, in, the, restaurant, business, while, uncommon, today, combination, microwave, ranges, were, offered, by, major, appliance, manufacturers, through, much, of, the, 1970s, as, a, natural, progression, of, the, technology, both, tappan, and, general, electric, offered, units, that, appeared, to, be, conventional, stove, top, oven, ranges, but, included, microwave, capability, in, the, conventional, oven, cavity, such, ranges, were, attractive, to, consumers, since, both, microwave, energy, and, conventional, heating, elements, could, be, used, simultaneously, to, speed, cooking, and, there, was, no, loss, of, countertop, space, the, proposition, was, also, attractive, to, manufacturers, as, the, additional, component, cost, could, better, be, absorbed, compared, with, countertop, units, where, pricing, was, increasingly, market, sensitive, by, 1972, litton, litton, atherton, division, minneapolis, introduced, two, new, microwave, ovens, priced, at, 349, and, 399, to, tap, into, the, market, estimated, at, 750, million, by, 1976, according, to, robert, i, bruder, president, of, the, division, while, prices, remained, high, new, features, continued, to, be, added, to, home, models, amana, introduced, automatic, defrost, in, 1974, on, their, rr, 4d, model, and, was, the, first, to, offer, a, microprocessor, controlled, digital, control, panel, in, 1975, with, their, rr, 6, model, the, late, 1970s, saw, an, explosion, of, low, cost, countertop, models, from, many, major, manufacturers, formerly, found, only, in, large, industrial, applications, microwave, ovens, increasingly, became, a, standard, fixture, of, residential, kitchens, in, developed, countries, by, 1986, roughly, 25, of, households, in, the, u, s, owned, a, microwave, oven, up, from, only, about, 1, in, 1971, the, u, s, bureau, of, labor, statistics, reported, that, over, 90, of, american, households, owned, a, microwave, oven, in, 1997, in, australia, a, 2008, market, research, study, found, that, 95, of, kitchens, contained, a, microwave, oven, and, that, 83, of, them, were, used, daily, in, canada, fewer, than, 5, of, households, had, a, microwave, oven, in, 1979, but, more, than, 88, of, households, owned, one, by, 1998, in, france, 40, of, households, owned, a, microwave, oven, in, 1994, but, that, number, had, increased, to, 65, by, 2004, adoption, has, been, slower, in, less, developed, countries, as, households, with, disposable, income, concentrate, on, more, important, household, appliances, like, refrigerators, and, ovens, in, india, for, example, only, about, 5, of, households, owned, a, microwave, oven, in, 2013, well, behind, refrigerators, at, 31, ownership, however, microwave, ovens, are, gaining, popularity, in, russia, for, example, the, number, of, households, with, a, microwave, oven, grew, from, almost, 24, in, 2002, to, almost, 40, in, 2008, almost, twice, as, many, households, in, south, africa, owned, microwave, ovens, in, 2008, 38, 7, as, in, 2002, 19, 8, microwave, oven, ownership, in, vietnam, in, 2008, was, at, 16, of, households, versus, 30, ownership, of, refrigerators, this, rate, was, up, significantly, from, 6, 7, microwave, oven, ownership, in, 2002, with, 14, ownership, for, refrigerators, that, year, consumer, household, microwave, ovens, usually, come, with, a, cooking, power, of, between, 600, and, 1200, watts, microwave, cooking, power, also, referred, to, as, output, wattage, is, lower, than, its, input, wattage, which, is, the, manufacturer, s, listed, power, rating, the, size, of, household, microwave, ovens, can, vary, but, usually, have, an, internal, volume, of, around, 20, liters, 1, 200, cu, in, 0, 71, cu, ft, and, external, dimensions, of, approximately, 45, 60, cm, 1, ft, 6, in, 2, ft, 0, in, wide, 35, 40, cm, 1, ft, 2, in, 1, ft, 4, in, deep, and, 25, 35, cm, 9, 8, in, 1, ft, 1, 8, in, tall, microwaves, can, be, turntable, or, flatbed, turntable, ovens, include, a, glass, plate, or, tray, flatbed, ones, do, not, include, a, plate, so, they, have, a, flat, and, wider, cavity, by, position, and, type, us, doe, classifies, them, as, 1, countertop, or, 2, over, the, range, and, built, in, wall, oven, for, a, cabinet, or, a, drawer, model, a, traditional, microwave, only, has, two, power, output, levels, fully, on, and, fully, off, intermediate, heat, settings, are, achieved, using, duty, cycle, modulation, and, switch, between, full, power, and, off, every, few, seconds, with, more, time, on, for, higher, settings, an, inverter, type, however, can, sustain, lower, temperatures, for, a, lengthy, duration, without, having, to, switch, itself, off, and, on, repeatedly, apart, from, offering, superior, cooking, ability, these, microwaves, are, generally, more, energy, efficient, as, of, 2020, the, majority, of, countertop, microwave, ovens, regardless, of, brand, sold, in, the, united, states, were, manufactured, by, the, midea, group, domestic, microwave, ovens, are, typically, marked, with, the, microwave, safe, symbol, next, to, the, device, s, approximate, iec, 60705, output, power, rating, in, watts, typically, either, 600w, 700w, 800w, 900w, 1000w, and, a, voluntary, heating, category, a, e, a, microwave, oven, heats, food, by, passing, microwave, radiation, through, it, microwaves, are, a, form, of, non, ionizing, electromagnetic, radiation, with, a, frequency, in, the, so, called, microwave, region, 300, mhz, to, 300, ghz, microwave, ovens, use, frequencies, in, one, of, the, ism, industrial, scientific, medical, bands, which, are, otherwise, used, for, communication, amongst, devices, that, do, not, need, a, license, to, operate, so, they, do, not, interfere, with, other, vital, radio, services, it, is, a, common, misconception, that, microwave, ovens, heat, food, by, operating, at, a, special, resonance, of, water, molecules, in, the, food, instead, microwave, ovens, heat, by, causing, molecules, to, spin, under, the, influence, of, a, constantly, changing, electric, field, usually, in, the, microwave, frequencies, range, and, a, higher, wattage, power, of, the, microwave, oven, results, in, faster, cooking, times, typically, consumer, ovens, work, around, a, nominal, 2, 45, gigahertz, ghz, a, wavelength, of, 12, 2, centimetres, 4, 80, in, in, the, 2, 4, ghz, to, 2, 5, ghz, ism, band, while, large, industrial, commercial, ovens, often, use, 915, megahertz, mhz, 32, 8, centimetres, 12, 9, in, among, other, differences, the, longer, wavelength, of, a, commercial, microwave, oven, allows, the, initial, heating, effects, to, begin, deeper, within, the, food, or, liquid, and, therefore, become, evenly, spread, within, its, bulk, sooner, as, well, as, raising, the, temperature, deep, within, the, food, more, quickly, a, microwave, oven, takes, advantage, of, the, electric, dipole, structure, of, water, molecules, fats, and, many, other, substances, in, the, food, using, a, process, known, as, dielectric, heating, these, molecules, have, a, partial, positive, charge, at, one, end, and, a, partial, negative, charge, at, the, other, in, an, alternating, electric, field, they, will, constantly, spin, around, as, they, continually, try, to, align, themselves, with, the, electric, field, this, can, happen, over, a, wide, range, of, frequencies, the, electric, field, s, energy, is, absorbed, by, the, dipole, molecules, as, rotational, energy, then, they, hit, non, dipole, molecules, making, them, move, faster, as, well, this, energy, is, shared, deeper, into, the, substance, as, molecular, rotations, vibrations, or, other, movement, signifying, an, increase, in, the, temperature, of, the, food, once, the, electrical, field, s, energy, is, initially, absorbed, heat, will, gradually, spread, through, the, object, similarly, to, any, other, heat, transfer, by, contact, with, a, hotter, body, microwave, heating, is, more, efficient, on, liquid, water, than, on, frozen, water, where, the, movement, of, molecules, is, more, restricted, defrosting, is, done, at, a, low, power, setting, allowing, time, for, conduction, to, carry, heat, to, still, frozen, parts, of, food, dielectric, heating, of, liquid, water, is, also, temperature, dependent, at, 0, c, dielectric, loss, is, greatest, at, a, field, frequency, of, about, 10, ghz, and, for, higher, water, temperatures, at, higher, field, frequencies, sugars, and, triglycerides, fats, and, oils, absorb, microwaves, due, to, the, dipole, moments, of, their, hydroxyl, groups, or, ester, groups, microwave, heating, is, less, efficient, on, fats, and, sugars, than, on, water, because, they, have, a, smaller, molecular, dipole, moment, although, fats, and, sugar, typically, absorb, energy, less, efficiently, than, water, paradoxically, their, temperatures, rise, faster, and, higher, than, water, when, cooking, fats, and, oils, require, less, energy, delivered, per, gram, of, material, to, raise, their, temperature, by, 1, c, than, does, water, they, have, lower, specific, heat, capacity, and, they, begin, cooling, off, by, boiling, only, after, reaching, a, higher, temperature, than, water, the, temperature, they, require, to, vaporize, is, higher, so, inside, microwave, ovens, they, normally, reach, higher, temperatures, sometimes, much, higher, this, can, induce, temperatures, in, oil, or, fatty, foods, like, bacon, far, above, the, boiling, point, of, water, and, high, enough, to, induce, some, browning, reactions, much, in, the, manner, of, conventional, broiling, uk, grilling, braising, or, deep, fat, frying, the, effect, is, most, often, noticed, by, consumers, from, unexpected, damage, to, plastic, containers, when, microwaving, foods, high, in, sugar, starch, or, fat, generates, higher, temperatures, foods, high, in, water, content, and, with, little, oil, rarely, exceed, the, boiling, temperature, of, water, and, do, not, damage, plastic, cookware, must, be, transparent, to, microwaves, conductive, cookware, such, as, metal, pots, reflects, microwaves, and, prevents, the, microwaves, from, reaching, the, food, cookware, made, of, materials, with, high, electrical, permittivity, will, absorb, microwaves, resulting, in, the, cookware, heating, rather, than, the, food, cookware, made, of, melamine, resin, is, a, common, type, of, cookware, that, will, heat, in, a, microwave, oven, reducing, the, effectiveness, of, the, microwave, oven, and, creating, a, hazard, from, burns, or, shattered, cookware, microwave, heating, can, cause, localized, thermal, runaways, in, some, materials, with, low, thermal, conductivity, which, also, have, dielectric, constants, that, increase, with, temperature, an, example, is, glass, which, can, exhibit, thermal, runaway, in, a, microwave, oven, to, the, point, of, melting, if, preheated, additionally, microwaves, can, melt, certain, types, of, rocks, producing, small, quantities, of, molten, rock, some, ceramics, can, also, be, melted, and, may, even, become, clear, upon, cooling, thermal, runaway, is, more, typical, of, electrically, conductive, liquids, such, as, salty, water, another, misconception, is, that, microwave, ovens, cook, food, from, the, inside, out, meaning, from, the, center, of, the, entire, mass, of, food, outwards, this, idea, arises, from, heating, behavior, seen, if, an, absorbent, layer, of, water, lies, beneath, a, less, absorbent, drier, layer, at, the, surface, of, a, food, in, this, case, the, deposition, of, heat, energy, inside, a, food, can, exceed, that, on, its, surface, this, can, also, occur, if, the, inner, layer, has, a, lower, heat, capacity, than, the, outer, layer, causing, it, to, reach, a, higher, temperature, or, even, if, the, inner, layer, is, more, thermally, conductive, than, the, outer, layer, making, it, feel, hotter, despite, having, a, lower, temperature, in, most, cases, however, with, uniformly, structured, or, reasonably, homogeneous, food, item, microwaves, are, absorbed, in, the, outer, layers, of, the, item, at, a, similar, level, to, that, of, the, inner, layers, depending, on, water, content, the, depth, of, initial, heat, deposition, may, be, several, centimetres, or, more, with, microwave, ovens, in, contrast, with, broiling, grilling, infrared, or, convection, heating, methods, which, thinly, deposit, heat, at, the, food, surface, penetration, depth, of, microwaves, depends, on, food, composition, and, the, frequency, with, lower, microwave, frequencies, longer, wavelengths, penetrating, deeper, in, use, microwave, ovens, can, be, as, low, as, 50, efficient, at, converting, electricity, into, microwaves, but, energy, efficient, models, can, exceed, 64, efficiency, stovetop, cooking, is, 40, 90, efficient, depending, on, the, type, of, appliance, used, because, they, are, used, fairly, infrequently, the, average, residential, microwave, oven, consumes, only, 72, kwh, per, year, globally, microwave, ovens, used, an, estimated, 77, twh, per, year, in, 2018, or, 0, 3, of, global, electricity, generation, a, 2000, study, by, lawrence, berkeley, national, laboratory, found, that, the, average, microwave, drew, almost, 3, watts, of, standby, power, when, not, being, used, which, would, total, approximately, 26, kwh, per, year, new, efficiency, standards, imposed, in, 2016, by, the, united, states, department, of, energy, require, less, than, 1, watt, or, approximately, 9, kwh, per, year, of, standby, power, for, most, types, of, microwave, ovens, a, microwave, oven, generally, consists, of, in, most, ovens, the, magnetron, is, driven, by, a, linear, transformer, which, can, only, feasibly, be, switched, completely, on, or, off, one, variant, of, the, ge, spacemaker, had, two, taps, on, the, transformer, primary, for, high, and, low, power, modes, usually, choice, of, power, level, does, not, affect, intensity, of, the, microwave, radiation, instead, the, magnetron, is, cycled, on, and, off, every, few, seconds, thus, altering, the, large, scale, duty, cycle, newer, models, use, inverter, power, supplies, that, use, pulse, width, modulation, to, provide, effectively, continuous, heating, at, reduced, power, settings, so, that, foods, are, heated, more, evenly, at, a, given, power, level, and, can, be, heated, more, quickly, without, being, damaged, by, uneven, heating, the, microwave, frequencies, used, in, microwave, ovens, are, chosen, based, on, regulatory, and, cost, constraints, the, first, is, that, they, should, be, in, one, of, the, industrial, scientific, and, medical, ism, frequency, bands, set, aside, for, unlicensed, purposes, for, household, purposes, 2, 45, ghz, has, the, advantage, over, 915, mhz, in, that, 915, mhz, is, only, an, ism, band, in, some, countries, itu, region, 2, while, 2, 45, ghz, is, available, worldwide, three, additional, ism, bands, exist, in, the, microwave, frequencies, but, are, not, used, for, microwave, cooking, two, of, them, are, centered, on, 5, 8, ghz, and, 24, 125, ghz, but, are, not, used, for, microwave, cooking, because, of, the, very, high, cost, of, power, generation, at, these, frequencies, the, third, centered, on, 433, 92, mhz, is, a, narrow, band, that, would, require, expensive, equipment, to, generate, sufficient, power, without, creating, interference, outside, the, band, and, is, only, available, in, some, countries, the, cooking, chamber, is, similar, to, a, faraday, cage, to, prevent, the, waves, from, coming, out, of, the, oven, even, though, there, is, no, continuous, metal, to, metal, contact, around, the, rim, of, the, door, choke, connections, on, the, door, edges, act, like, metal, to, metal, contact, at, the, frequency, of, the, microwaves, to, prevent, leakage, the, oven, door, usually, has, a, window, for, easy, viewing, with, a, layer, of, conductive, mesh, some, distance, from, the, outer, panel, to, maintain, the, shielding, because, the, size, of, the, perforations, in, the, mesh, is, much, less, than, the, microwaves, wavelength, 12, 2, cm, for, the, usual, 2, 45, ghz, microwave, radiation, cannot, pass, through, the, door, while, visible, light, with, its, much, shorter, wavelength, can, modern, microwave, ovens, use, either, an, analog, dial, type, timer, or, a, digital, control, panel, for, operation, control, panels, feature, an, led, lcd, or, vacuum, fluorescent, display, buttons, for, entering, the, cook, time, and, a, power, level, selection, feature, a, defrost, option, is, typically, offered, as, either, a, power, level, or, a, separate, function, some, models, include, pre, programmed, settings, for, different, food, types, typically, taking, weight, as, input, in, the, 1990s, brands, such, as, panasonic, and, ge, began, offering, models, with, a, scrolling, text, display, showing, cooking, instructions, power, settings, are, commonly, implemented, not, by, actually, varying, the, power, output, but, by, switching, the, emission, of, microwave, energy, off, and, on, at, intervals, the, highest, setting, thus, represents, continuous, power, defrost, might, represent, power, for, two, seconds, followed, by, no, power, for, five, seconds, to, indicate, cooking, has, completed, an, audible, warning, such, as, a, bell, or, a, beeper, is, usually, present, and, or, end, usually, appears, on, the, display, of, a, digital, microwave, microwave, control, panels, are, often, considered, awkward, to, use, and, are, frequently, employed, as, examples, for, user, interface, design, a, variant, of, the, conventional, microwave, oven, is, the, convection, microwave, oven, a, convection, microwave, oven, is, a, combination, of, a, standard, microwave, oven, and, a, convection, oven, it, allows, food, to, be, cooked, quickly, yet, come, out, browned, or, crisped, as, from, a, convection, oven, convection, microwave, ovens, are, more, expensive, than, conventional, microwave, ovens, some, convection, microwave, ovens, those, with, exposed, heating, elements, can, produce, smoke, and, burning, odors, as, food, spatter, from, earlier, microwave, only, use, is, burned, off, the, heating, elements, some, ovens, use, high, speed, air, these, are, known, as, impingement, ovens, and, are, designed, to, cook, food, quickly, in, restaurants, but, cost, more, and, consume, more, power, in, 2000, some, manufacturers, began, offering, high, power, quartz, halogen, bulbs, to, their, convection, microwave, oven, models, marketing, them, under, names, such, as, speedcook, advantium, lightwave, and, optimawave, to, emphasize, their, ability, to, cook, food, rapidly, and, with, good, browning, the, bulbs, heat, the, food, s, surface, with, infrared, ir, radiation, browning, surfaces, as, in, a, conventional, oven, the, food, browns, while, also, being, heated, by, the, microwave, radiation, and, heated, through, conduction, through, contact, with, heated, air, the, ir, energy, which, is, delivered, to, the, outer, surface, of, food, by, the, lamps, is, sufficient, to, initiate, browning, caramelization, in, foods, primarily, made, up, of, carbohydrates, and, maillard, reactions, in, foods, primarily, made, up, of, protein, these, reactions, in, food, produce, a, texture, and, taste, similar, to, that, typically, expected, of, conventional, oven, cooking, rather, than, the, bland, boiled, and, steamed, taste, that, microwave, only, cooking, tends, to, create, in, order, to, aid, browning, sometimes, an, accessory, browning, tray, is, used, usually, composed, of, glass, or, porcelain, it, makes, food, crisp, by, oxidizing, the, top, layer, until, it, turns, brown, ordinary, plastic, cookware, is, unsuitable, for, this, purpose, because, it, could, melt, frozen, dinners, pies, and, microwave, popcorn, bags, often, contain, a, susceptor, made, from, thin, aluminium, film, in, the, packaging, or, included, on, a, small, paper, tray, the, metal, film, absorbs, microwave, energy, efficiently, and, consequently, becomes, extremely, hot, and, radiates, in, the, infrared, concentrating, the, heating, of, oil, for, popcorn, or, even, browning, surfaces, of, frozen, foods, heating, packages, or, trays, containing, susceptors, are, designed, for, a, single, use, and, are, then, discarded, as, waste, microwave, ovens, produce, heat, directly, within, the, food, but, despite, the, common, misconception, that, microwaved, food, cooks, from, the, inside, out, 2, 45, ghz, microwaves, can, only, penetrate, approximately, 1, centimeter, 0, 39, in, into, most, foods, the, inside, portions, of, thicker, foods, are, mainly, heated, by, heat, conducted, from, the, outer, 1, centimeter, 0, 39, in, uneven, heating, in, microwaved, food, can, be, partly, due, to, the, uneven, distribution, of, microwave, energy, inside, the, oven, and, partly, due, to, the, different, rates, of, energy, absorption, in, different, parts, of, the, food, the, first, problem, is, reduced, by, a, stirrer, a, type, of, fan, that, reflects, microwave, energy, to, different, parts, of, the, oven, as, it, rotates, or, by, a, turntable, or, carousel, that, turns, the, food, turntables, however, may, still, leave, spots, such, as, the, center, of, the, oven, which, receive, uneven, energy, distribution, the, second, problem, is, due, to, food, composition, and, geometry, and, must, be, addressed, by, the, cook, by, arranging, the, food, so, that, it, absorbs, energy, evenly, and, periodically, testing, and, shielding, any, parts, of, the, food, that, overheat, in, some, materials, with, low, thermal, conductivity, where, dielectric, constant, increases, with, temperature, microwave, heating, can, cause, localized, thermal, runaway, under, certain, conditions, glass, can, exhibit, thermal, runaway, in, a, microwave, oven, to, the, point, of, melting, due, to, this, phenomenon, microwave, ovens, set, at, too, high, power, levels, may, even, start, to, cook, the, edges, of, frozen, food, while, the, inside, of, the, food, remains, frozen, another, case, of, uneven, heating, can, be, observed, in, baked, goods, containing, berries, in, these, items, the, berries, absorb, more, energy, than, the, drier, surrounding, bread, and, cannot, dissipate, the, heat, due, to, the, low, thermal, conductivity, of, the, bread, often, this, results, in, overheating, the, berries, relative, to, the, rest, of, the, food, defrost, oven, settings, either, use, low, power, levels, or, repeatedly, turn, the, power, off, and, on, intended, to, allow, time, for, heat, to, be, conducted, within, frozen, foods, from, areas, that, absorb, heat, more, readily, to, those, which, heat, more, slowly, in, turntable, equipped, ovens, more, even, heating, can, take, place, by, placing, food, off, center, on, the, turntable, tray, instead, of, exactly, in, the, center, as, this, results, in, more, even, heating, of, the, food, throughout, there, are, microwave, ovens, on, the, market, that, allow, full, power, defrosting, they, do, this, by, exploiting, the, properties, of, the, electromagnetic, radiation, lsm, modes, lsm, full, power, defrosting, may, actually, achieve, more, even, results, than, slow, defrosting, microwave, heating, can, be, deliberately, uneven, by, design, some, microwavable, packages, notably, pies, may, include, materials, that, contain, ceramic, or, aluminium, flakes, which, are, designed, to, absorb, microwaves, and, heat, up, which, aids, in, baking, or, crust, preparation, by, depositing, more, energy, shallowly, in, these, areas, the, technical, term, for, such, a, microwave, absorbing, patch, is, a, susceptor, such, ceramic, patches, affixed, to, cardboard, are, positioned, next, to, the, food, and, are, typically, smokey, blue, or, gray, in, colour, usually, making, them, easily, identifiable, the, cardboard, sleeves, included, with, hot, pockets, which, have, a, silver, surface, on, the, inside, are, a, good, example, of, such, packaging, microwavable, cardboard, packaging, may, also, contain, overhead, ceramic, patches, which, function, in, the, same, way, any, form, of, cooking, diminishes, overall, nutrient, content, in, food, particularly, water, soluble, vitamins, common, in, vegetables, but, the, key, variables, are, how, much, water, is, used, in, the, cooking, how, long, the, food, is, cooked, and, at, what, temperature, nutrients, are, primarily, lost, by, leaching, into, cooking, water, which, tends, to, make, microwave, cooking, effective, given, the, shorter, cooking, times, it, requires, and, that, the, water, heated, is, in, the, food, like, other, heating, methods, microwaving, converts, vitamin, b, 12, from, an, active, to, inactive, form, the, amount, of, conversion, depends, on, the, temperature, reached, as, well, as, the, cooking, time, boiled, food, reaches, a, maximum, of, 100, c, 212, f, the, boiling, point, of, water, whereas, microwaved, food, can, get, internally, hotter, than, this, leading, to, faster, breakdown, of, vitamin, b, 12, the, higher, rate, of, loss, is, partially, offset, by, the, shorter, cooking, times, required, spinach, retains, nearly, all, its, folate, when, cooked, in, a, microwave, oven, when, boiled, it, loses, about, 77, leaching, nutrients, into, the, cooking, water, bacon, cooked, by, microwave, oven, has, significantly, lower, levels, of, nitrosamines, than, conventionally, cooked, bacon, steamed, vegetables, tend, to, maintain, more, nutrients, when, microwaved, than, when, cooked, on, a, stovetop, microwave, blanching, is, 3, 4, times, more, effective, than, boiled, water, blanching, for, retaining, of, the, water, soluble, vitamins, folate, thiamin, and, riboflavin, with, the, exception, of, vitamin, c, of, which, 29, is, lost, compared, with, a, 16, loss, with, boiled, water, blanching, all, microwave, ovens, use, a, timer, to, switch, off, the, oven, at, the, end, of, the, cooking, time, microwave, ovens, heat, food, without, getting, hot, themselves, taking, a, pot, off, a, stove, unless, it, is, an, induction, cooktop, leaves, a, potentially, dangerous, heating, element, or, trivet, that, remains, hot, for, some, time, likewise, when, taking, a, casserole, out, of, a, conventional, oven, one, s, arms, are, exposed, to, the, very, hot, walls, of, the, oven, a, microwave, oven, does, not, pose, this, problem, food, and, cookware, taken, out, of, a, microwave, oven, are, rarely, much, hotter, than, 100, c, 212, f, cookware, used, in, a, microwave, oven, is, often, much, cooler, than, the, food, because, the, cookware, is, transparent, to, microwaves, the, microwaves, heat, the, food, directly, and, the, cookware, is, indirectly, heated, by, the, food, food, and, cookware, from, a, conventional, oven, on, the, other, hand, are, the, same, temperature, as, the, rest, of, the, oven, a, typical, cooking, temperature, is, 180, c, 356, f, that, means, that, conventional, stoves, and, ovens, can, cause, more, serious, burns, the, lower, temperature, of, cooking, the, boiling, point, of, water, is, a, significant, safety, benefit, compared, with, baking, in, the, oven, or, frying, because, it, eliminates, the, formation, of, tars, and, char, which, are, carcinogenic, microwave, radiation, also, penetrates, deeper, than, direct, heat, so, that, the, food, is, heated, by, its, own, internal, water, content, in, contrast, direct, heat, can, burn, the, surface, while, the, inside, is, still, cold, pre, heating, the, food, in, a, microwave, oven, before, putting, it, into, the, grill, or, pan, reduces, the, time, needed, to, heat, up, the, food, and, reduces, the, formation, of, carcinogenic, char, unlike, frying, and, baking, microwaving, does, not, produce, acrylamide, in, potatoes, however, unlike, deep, frying, at, high, temperatures, it, is, of, only, limited, effectiveness, in, reducing, glycoalkaloid, i, e, solanine, levels, acrylamide, has, been, found, in, other, microwaved, products, like, popcorn, studies, have, investigated, the, use, of, the, microwave, oven, to, clean, non, metallic, domestic, sponges, which, have, been, thoroughly, wetted, a, 2006, study, found, that, microwaving, wet, sponges, for, 2, minutes, at, 1, 000, watt, power, removed, 99, of, coliforms, e, coli, and, ms2, phages, bacillus, cereus, spores, were, killed, at, 4, minutes, of, microwaving, a, 2017, study, was, less, affirmative, about, 60, of, the, germs, were, killed, but, the, remaining, ones, quickly, re, colonized, the, sponge, closed, containers, such, as, eggs, can, explode, when, heated, in, a, microwave, oven, due, to, the, increased, pressure, from, steam, intact, fresh, egg, yolks, outside, the, shell, also, explode, as, a, result, of, superheating, insulating, plastic, foams, of, all, types, generally, contain, closed, air, pockets, and, are, generally, not, recommended, for, use, in, a, microwave, oven, as, the, air, pockets, explode, and, the, foam, which, can, be, toxic, if, consumed, may, melt, not, all, plastics, are, microwave, safe, and, some, plastics, absorb, microwaves, to, the, point, that, they, may, become, dangerously, hot, products, that, are, heated, for, too, long, can, catch, fire, though, this, is, inherent, to, any, form, of, cooking, the, rapid, cooking, and, unattended, nature, of, the, use, of, microwave, ovens, results, in, additional, hazard, in, rare, cases, water, and, other, homogeneous, liquids, can, superheat, when, heated, in, a, microwave, oven, in, a, container, with, a, smooth, surface, that, is, the, liquid, reaches, a, temperature, slightly, above, its, normal, boiling, point, without, bubbles, of, vapour, forming, inside, the, liquid, the, boiling, process, can, start, explosively, when, the, liquid, is, disturbed, such, as, when, the, user, takes, hold, of, the, container, to, remove, it, from, the, oven, or, while, adding, solid, ingredients, such, as, powdered, creamer, or, sugar, this, can, result, in, spontaneous, boiling, nucleation, which, may, be, violent, enough, to, eject, the, boiling, liquid, from, the, container, and, cause, severe, scalding, contrary, to, popular, assumptions, metal, objects, can, be, safely, used, in, a, microwave, oven, but, with, some, restrictions, any, metal, or, conductive, object, placed, into, the, microwave, oven, acts, as, an, antenna, to, some, degree, resulting, in, an, electric, current, this, causes, the, object, to, act, as, a, heating, element, this, effect, varies, with, the, object, s, shape, and, composition, and, is, sometimes, utilized, for, cooking, any, object, containing, pointed, metal, can, create, an, electric, arc, sparks, when, microwaved, this, includes, cutlery, crumpled, aluminium, foil, though, some, foil, used, in, microwave, ovens, is, safe, see, below, twist, ties, containing, metal, wire, the, metal, wire, carry, handles, in, oyster, pails, or, almost, any, metal, formed, into, a, poorly, conductive, foil, or, thin, wire, or, into, a, pointed, shape, forks, are, a, good, example, the, tines, of, the, fork, respond, to, the, electric, field, by, producing, high, concentrations, of, electric, charge, at, the, tips, this, has, the, effect, of, exceeding, the, dielectric, breakdown, of, air, about, 3, megavolts, per, meter, 3, 10, 6, v, m, the, air, forms, a, conductive, plasma, which, is, visible, as, a, spark, the, plasma, and, the, tines, may, then, form, a, conductive, loop, which, may, be, a, more, effective, antenna, resulting, in, a, longer, lived, spark, when, dielectric, breakdown, occurs, in, air, some, ozone, and, nitrogen, oxides, are, formed, both, of, which, are, unhealthy, in, large, quantities, microwaving, an, individual, smooth, metal, object, without, pointed, ends, for, example, a, spoon, or, shallow, metal, pan, usually, does, not, produce, sparking, thick, metal, wire, racks, can, be, part, of, the, interior, design, in, microwave, ovens, see, illustration, in, a, similar, way, the, interior, wall, plates, with, perforating, holes, which, allow, light, and, air, into, the, oven, and, allow, interior, viewing, through, the, oven, door, are, all, made, of, conductive, metal, formed, in, a, safe, shape, the, effect, of, microwaving, thin, metal, films, can, be, seen, clearly, on, a, compact, disc, or, dvd, particularly, the, factory, pressed, type, the, microwaves, induce, electric, currents, in, the, metal, film, which, heats, up, melting, the, plastic, in, the, disc, and, leaving, a, visible, pattern, of, concentric, and, radial, scars, similarly, porcelain, with, thin, metal, films, can, also, be, destroyed, or, damaged, by, microwaving, aluminium, foil, is, thick, enough, to, be, used, in, microwave, ovens, as, a, shield, against, heating, parts, of, food, items, if, the, foil, is, not, badly, warped, when, wrinkled, aluminium, foil, is, generally, unsafe, in, microwaves, as, manipulation, of, the, foil, causes, sharp, bends, and, gaps, that, invite, sparking, the, usda, recommends, that, aluminium, foil, used, as, a, partial, food, shield, in, microwave, oven, cooking, cover, no, more, than, one, quarter, of, a, food, object, and, be, carefully, smoothed, to, eliminate, sparking, hazards, another, hazard, is, the, resonance, of, the, magnetron, tube, itself, if, the, microwave, oven, is, run, without, an, object, to, absorb, the, radiation, a, standing, wave, forms, the, energy, is, reflected, back, and, forth, between, the, tube, and, the, cooking, chamber, this, may, cause, the, tube, to, overload, and, burn, out, high, reflected, power, may, also, cause, magnetron, arcing, possibly, resulting, in, primary, power, fuse, failure, though, such, a, causal, relationship, is, not, easily, established, thus, dehydrated, food, or, food, wrapped, in, metal, which, does, not, arc, is, problematic, for, overload, reasons, without, necessarily, being, a, fire, hazard, certain, foods, such, as, grapes, if, properly, arranged, can, produce, an, electric, arc, prolonged, arcing, from, food, carries, similar, risks, to, arcing, from, other, sources, as, noted, above, some, other, objects, that, may, conduct, sparks, are, plastic, holographic, print, thermos, flasks, and, other, heat, retaining, containers, such, as, starbucks, novelty, cups, or, cups, with, metal, lining, if, any, bit, of, the, metal, is, exposed, all, the, outer, shell, can, burst, off, the, object, or, melt, the, high, electrical, fields, generated, inside, a, microwave, oven, often, can, be, illustrated, by, placing, a, radiometer, or, neon, glow, bulb, inside, the, cooking, chamber, creating, glowing, plasma, inside, the, low, pressure, bulb, of, the, device, direct, microwave, exposure, is, not, generally, possible, as, microwaves, emitted, by, the, source, in, a, microwave, oven, are, confined, in, the, oven, by, the, material, out, of, which, the, oven, is, constructed, furthermore, ovens, are, equipped, with, redundant, safety, interlocks, which, remove, power, from, the, magnetron, if, the, door, is, opened, this, safety, mechanism, is, required, by, united, states, federal, regulations, tests, have, shown, confinement, of, the, microwaves, in, commercially, available, ovens, to, be, so, nearly, universal, as, to, make, routine, testing, unnecessary, according, to, the, united, states, food, and, drug, administration, s, center, for, devices, and, radiological, health, a, u, s, federal, standard, limits, the, amount, of, microwaves, that, can, leak, from, an, oven, throughout, its, lifetime, to, 5, milliwatts, of, microwave, radiation, per, square, centimeter, at, approximately, 5, cm, 2, in, from, the, surface, of, the, oven, this, is, far, below, the, exposure, level, currently, considered, to, be, harmful, to, human, health, the, radiation, produced, by, a, microwave, oven, is, non, ionizing, it, therefore, does, not, have, the, cancer, risks, associated, with, ionizing, radiation, such, as, x, rays, and, high, energy, particles, long, term, rodent, studies, to, assess, cancer, risk, have, so, far, failed, to, identify, any, carcinogenicity, from, 2, 45, ghz, microwave, radiation, even, with, chronic, exposure, levels, i, e, large, fraction, of, life, span, far, larger, than, humans, are, likely, to, encounter, from, any, leaking, ovens, however, with, the, oven, door, open, the, radiation, may, cause, damage, by, heating, microwave, ovens, are, sold, with, a, protective, interlock, so, that, it, cannot, be, run, when, the, door, is, open, or, improperly, latched, microwaves, generated, in, microwave, ovens, cease, to, exist, once, the, electrical, power, is, turned, off, they, do, not, remain, in, the, food, when, the, power, is, turned, off, any, more, than, light, from, an, electric, lamp, remains, in, the, walls, and, furnishings, of, a, room, when, the, lamp, is, turned, off, they, do, not, make, the, food, or, the, oven, radioactive, in, contrast, with, conventional, cooking, the, nutritional, content, of, some, foods, may, be, altered, differently, but, generally, in, a, positive, way, by, preserving, more, micronutrients, see, above, there, is, no, indication, of, detrimental, health, issues, associated, with, microwaved, food, there, are, however, a, few, cases, where, people, have, been, exposed, to, direct, microwave, radiation, either, from, appliance, malfunction, or, deliberate, action, this, exposure, generally, results, in, physical, burns, to, the, body, as, human, tissue, particularly, the, outer, fat, and, muscle, layers, has, a, similar, composition, to, some, foods, that, are, typically, cooked, in, microwave, ovens, and, so, experiences, similar, dielectric, heating, effects, when, exposed, to, microwave, electromagnetic, radiation, the, use, of, unmarked, plastics, for, microwave, cooking, raises, the, issue, of, plasticizers, leaching, into, the, food, or, the, plastics, chemically, reacting, to, microwave, energy, with, by, products, leaching, into, the, food, suggesting, that, even, plastic, containers, marked, microwavable, may, still, leach, plastic, by, products, into, the, food, the, plasticizers, which, received, the, most, attention, are, bisphenol, a, bpa, and, phthalates, although, it, is, unclear, whether, other, plastic, components, present, a, toxicity, risk, other, issues, include, melting, and, flammability, an, alleged, issue, of, release, of, dioxins, into, food, has, been, dismissed, as, an, intentional, red, herring, distraction, from, actual, safety, issues, some, current, plastic, containers, and, food, wraps, are, specifically, designed, to, resist, radiation, from, microwaves, products, may, use, the, term, microwave, safe, may, carry, a, microwave, symbol, three, lines, of, waves, one, above, the, other, or, simply, provide, instructions, for, proper, microwave, oven, use, any, of, these, is, an, indication, that, a, product, is, suitable, for, microwaving, when, used, in, accordance, with, the, directions, provided, plastic, containers, can, release, microplastics, into, food, when, heated, in, microwave, ovens, microwave, ovens, are, frequently, used, for, reheating, leftover, food, and, bacterial, contamination, may, not, be, repressed, if, the, microwave, oven, is, used, improperly, if, safe, temperature, is, not, reached, this, can, result, in, foodborne, illness, as, with, other, reheating, methods, while, microwave, ovens, can, destroy, bacteria, as, well, as, conventional, ovens, can, they, cook, rapidly, and, may, not, cook, as, evenly, similar, to, frying, or, grilling, leading, to, a, risk, of, some, food, regions, failing, to, reach, recommended, temperatures, therefore, a, standing, period, after, cooking, to, allow, temperatures, in, the, food, to, equalize, is, recommended, as, well, as, the, use, of, a, food, thermometer, to, verify, internal, temperatures, microwave, ovens, although, shielded, for, safety, purposes, still, emit, low, levels, of, microwave, radiation, this, is, not, harmful, to, humans, but, can, sometimes, cause, interference, to, wi, fi, and, bluetooth, and, other, devices, that, communicate, on, the, 2, 45, ghz, wavebands, particularly, at, close, range, conventional, transformer, ovens, do, not, operate, continuously, over, the, mains, cycle, but, can, cause, significant, slowdowns, for, many, metres, around, the, oven, whereas, inverter, based, ovens, can, stop, nearby, networking, entirely, while, operating
