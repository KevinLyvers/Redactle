fire, is, the, rapid, oxidation, of, a, material, the, fuel, in, the, exothermic, chemical, process, of, combustion, releasing, heat, light, and, various, reaction, products, at, a, certain, point, in, the, combustion, reaction, called, the, ignition, point, flames, are, produced, the, flame, is, the, visible, portion, of, the, fire, flames, consist, primarily, of, carbon, dioxide, water, vapor, oxygen, and, nitrogen, if, hot, enough, the, gases, may, become, ionized, to, produce, plasma, depending, on, the, substances, alight, and, any, impurities, outside, the, color, of, the, flame, and, the, fire, s, intensity, will, be, different, fire, in, its, most, common, form, has, the, potential, to, result, in, conflagration, which, can, lead, to, physical, damage, which, can, be, permanent, through, burning, fire, is, a, significant, process, that, influences, ecological, systems, worldwide, the, positive, effects, of, fire, include, stimulating, growth, and, maintaining, various, ecological, systems, its, negative, effects, include, hazard, to, life, and, property, atmospheric, pollution, and, water, contamination, when, fire, removes, protective, vegetation, heavy, rainfall, can, contribute, to, increased, soil, erosion, by, water, additionally, the, burning, of, vegetation, releases, nitrogen, into, the, atmosphere, unlike, elements, such, as, potassium, and, phosphorus, which, remain, in, the, ash, and, are, quickly, recycled, into, the, soil, this, loss, of, nitrogen, caused, by, a, fire, produces, a, long, term, reduction, in, the, fertility, of, the, soil, which, can, be, recovered, as, atmospheric, nitrogen, is, fixed, and, converted, to, ammonia, by, natural, phenomena, such, as, lightning, or, by, leguminous, plants, such, as, clover, peas, and, green, beans, fire, is, one, of, the, four, classical, elements, and, has, been, used, by, humans, in, rituals, in, agriculture, for, clearing, land, for, cooking, generating, heat, and, light, for, signaling, propulsion, purposes, smelting, forging, incineration, of, waste, cremation, and, as, a, weapon, or, mode, of, destruction, the, word, fire, originated, from, old, english, fyr, fire, a, fire, which, can, be, traced, back, to, the, germanic, root, f, r, which, itself, comes, from, the, proto, indo, european, perjos, from, the, root, paewr, fire, the, current, spelling, of, fire, has, been, in, use, since, as, early, as, 1200, but, it, was, not, until, around, 1600, that, it, completely, replaced, the, middle, english, term, fier, which, is, still, preserved, in, the, word, fiery, the, fossil, record, of, fire, first, appears, with, the, establishment, of, a, land, based, flora, in, the, middle, ordovician, period, 470, million, years, ago, permitting, the, accumulation, of, oxygen, in, the, atmosphere, as, never, before, as, the, new, hordes, of, land, plants, pumped, it, out, as, a, waste, product, when, this, concentration, rose, above, 13, it, permitted, the, possibility, of, wildfire, wildfire, is, first, recorded, in, the, late, silurian, fossil, record, 420, million, years, ago, by, fossils, of, charcoalified, plants, apart, from, a, controversial, gap, in, the, late, devonian, charcoal, is, present, ever, since, the, level, of, atmospheric, oxygen, is, closely, related, to, the, prevalence, of, charcoal, clearly, oxygen, is, the, key, factor, in, the, abundance, of, wildfire, fire, also, became, more, abundant, when, grasses, radiated, and, became, the, dominant, component, of, many, ecosystems, around, 6, to, 7, million, years, ago, this, kindling, provided, tinder, which, allowed, for, the, more, rapid, spread, of, fire, these, widespread, fires, may, have, initiated, a, positive, feedback, process, whereby, they, produced, a, warmer, drier, climate, more, conducive, to, fire, the, ability, to, control, fire, was, a, dramatic, change, in, the, habits, of, early, humans, making, fire, to, generate, heat, and, light, made, it, possible, for, people, to, cook, food, simultaneously, increasing, the, variety, and, availability, of, nutrients, and, reducing, disease, by, killing, pathogenic, microorganisms, in, the, food, the, heat, produced, would, also, help, people, stay, warm, in, cold, weather, enabling, them, to, live, in, cooler, climates, fire, also, kept, nocturnal, predators, at, bay, evidence, of, occasional, cooked, food, is, found, from, 1, million, years, ago, although, this, evidence, shows, that, fire, may, have, been, used, in, a, controlled, fashion, about, 1, million, years, ago, other, sources, put, the, date, of, regular, use, at, 400, 000, years, ago, evidence, becomes, widespread, around, 50, to, 100, thousand, years, ago, suggesting, regular, use, from, this, time, interestingly, resistance, to, air, pollution, started, to, evolve, in, human, populations, at, a, similar, point, in, time, the, use, of, fire, became, progressively, more, sophisticated, as, it, was, used, to, create, charcoal, and, to, control, wildlife, from, tens, of, thousands, of, years, ago, fire, has, also, been, used, for, centuries, as, a, method, of, torture, and, execution, as, evidenced, by, death, by, burning, as, well, as, torture, devices, such, as, the, iron, boot, which, could, be, filled, with, water, oil, or, even, lead, and, then, heated, over, an, open, fire, to, the, agony, of, the, wearer, by, the, neolithic, revolution, during, the, introduction, of, grain, based, agriculture, people, all, over, the, world, used, fire, as, a, tool, in, landscape, management, these, fires, were, typically, controlled, burns, or, cool, fires, as, opposed, to, uncontrolled, hot, fires, which, damage, the, soil, hot, fires, destroy, plants, and, animals, and, endanger, communities, this, is, especially, a, problem, in, the, forests, of, today, where, traditional, burning, is, prevented, in, order, to, encourage, the, growth, of, timber, crops, cool, fires, are, generally, conducted, in, the, spring, and, autumn, they, clear, undergrowth, burning, up, biomass, that, could, trigger, a, hot, fire, should, it, get, too, dense, they, provide, a, greater, variety, of, environments, which, encourages, game, and, plant, diversity, for, humans, they, make, dense, impassable, forests, traversable, another, human, use, for, fire, in, regards, to, landscape, management, is, its, use, to, clear, land, for, agriculture, slash, and, burn, agriculture, is, still, common, across, much, of, tropical, africa, asia, and, south, america, for, small, farmers, controlled, fires, are, a, convenient, way, to, clear, overgrown, areas, and, release, nutrients, from, standing, vegetation, back, into, the, soil, however, this, useful, strategy, is, also, problematic, growing, population, fragmentation, of, forests, and, warming, climate, are, making, the, earth, s, surface, more, prone, to, ever, larger, escaped, fires, these, harm, ecosystems, and, human, infrastructure, cause, health, problems, and, send, up, spirals, of, carbon, and, soot, that, may, encourage, even, more, warming, of, the, atmosphere, and, thus, feed, back, into, more, fires, globally, today, as, much, as, 5, million, square, kilometres, an, area, more, than, half, the, size, of, the, united, states, burns, in, a, given, year, there, are, numerous, modern, applications, of, fire, in, its, broadest, sense, fire, is, used, by, nearly, every, human, being, on, earth, in, a, controlled, setting, every, day, users, of, internal, combustion, vehicles, employ, fire, every, time, they, drive, thermal, power, stations, provide, electricity, for, a, large, percentage, of, humanity, by, igniting, fuels, such, as, coal, oil, or, natural, gas, then, using, the, resultant, heat, to, boil, water, into, steam, which, then, drives, turbines, the, use, of, fire, in, warfare, has, a, long, history, fire, was, the, basis, of, all, early, thermal, weapons, the, byzantine, fleet, used, greek, fire, to, attack, ships, and, men, the, invention, of, gunpowder, in, china, led, to, the, fire, lance, a, flame, thrower, weapon, dating, to, around, 1000, ce, which, was, a, precursor, to, projectile, weapons, driven, by, burning, gunpowder, the, earliest, modern, flamethrowers, were, used, by, infantry, in, the, first, world, war, first, used, by, german, troops, against, entrenched, french, troops, near, verdun, in, february, 1915, they, were, later, successfully, mounted, on, armoured, vehicles, in, the, second, world, war, hand, thrown, incendiary, bombs, improvised, from, glass, bottles, later, known, as, molotov, cocktails, were, deployed, during, the, spanish, civil, war, in, the, 1930s, also, during, that, war, incendiary, bombs, were, deployed, against, guernica, by, fascist, italian, and, nazi, german, air, forces, that, had, been, created, specifically, to, support, franco, s, nationalists, incendiary, bombs, were, dropped, by, axis, and, allies, during, the, second, world, war, notably, on, coventry, tokyo, rotterdam, london, hamburg, and, dresden, in, the, latter, two, cases, firestorms, were, deliberately, caused, in, which, a, ring, of, fire, surrounding, each, city, was, drawn, inward, by, an, updraft, caused, by, a, central, cluster, of, fires, the, united, states, army, air, force, also, extensively, used, incendiaries, against, japanese, targets, in, the, latter, months, of, the, war, devastating, entire, cities, constructed, primarily, of, wood, and, paper, houses, the, incendiary, fluid, napalm, was, used, in, july, 1944, towards, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, although, its, use, did, not, gain, public, attention, until, the, vietnam, war, controlling, a, fire, to, optimize, its, size, shape, and, intensity, is, generally, called, fire, management, and, the, more, advanced, forms, of, it, as, traditionally, and, sometimes, still, practiced, by, skilled, cooks, blacksmiths, ironmasters, and, others, are, highly, skilled, activities, they, include, knowledge, of, which, fuel, to, burn, how, to, arrange, the, fuel, how, to, stoke, the, fire, both, in, early, phases, and, in, maintenance, phases, how, to, modulate, the, heat, flame, and, smoke, as, suited, to, the, desired, application, how, best, to, bank, a, fire, to, be, revived, later, how, to, choose, design, or, modify, stoves, fireplaces, bakery, ovens, or, industrial, furnaces, and, so, on, detailed, expositions, of, fire, management, are, available, in, various, books, about, blacksmithing, about, skilled, camping, or, military, scouting, and, about, domestic, arts, burning, fuel, converts, chemical, energy, into, heat, energy, wood, has, been, used, as, fuel, since, prehistory, the, international, energy, agency, states, that, nearly, 80, of, the, world, s, power, has, consistently, come, from, fossil, fuels, such, as, petroleum, natural, gas, and, coal, in, the, past, decades, the, fire, in, a, power, station, is, used, to, heat, water, creating, steam, that, drives, turbines, the, turbines, then, spin, an, electric, generator, to, produce, electricity, fire, is, also, used, to, provide, mechanical, work, directly, by, thermal, expansion, in, both, external, and, internal, combustion, engines, the, unburnable, solid, remains, of, a, combustible, material, left, after, a, fire, is, called, clinker, if, its, melting, point, is, below, the, flame, temperature, so, that, it, fuses, and, then, solidifies, as, it, cools, and, ash, if, its, melting, point, is, above, the, flame, temperature, fire, is, a, chemical, process, in, which, a, fuel, and, an, oxidizing, agent, react, yielding, carbon, dioxide, and, water, this, process, known, as, a, combustion, reaction, does, not, proceed, directly, and, involves, intermediates, although, the, oxidizing, agent, is, typically, oxygen, other, compounds, are, able, to, fulfill, the, role, for, instance, chlorine, trifluoride, is, able, to, ignite, sand, fires, start, when, a, flammable, or, a, combustible, material, in, combination, with, a, sufficient, quantity, of, an, oxidizer, such, as, oxygen, gas, or, another, oxygen, rich, compound, though, non, oxygen, oxidizers, exist, is, exposed, to, a, source, of, heat, or, ambient, temperature, above, the, flash, point, for, the, fuel, oxidizer, mix, and, is, able, to, sustain, a, rate, of, rapid, oxidation, that, produces, a, chain, reaction, this, is, commonly, called, the, fire, tetrahedron, fire, cannot, exist, without, all, of, these, elements, in, place, and, in, the, right, proportions, for, example, a, flammable, liquid, will, start, burning, only, if, the, fuel, and, oxygen, are, in, the, right, proportions, some, fuel, oxygen, mixes, may, require, a, catalyst, a, substance, that, is, not, consumed, when, added, in, any, chemical, reaction, during, combustion, but, which, enables, the, reactants, to, combust, more, readily, once, ignited, a, chain, reaction, must, take, place, whereby, fires, can, sustain, their, own, heat, by, the, further, release, of, heat, energy, in, the, process, of, combustion, and, may, propagate, provided, there, is, a, continuous, supply, of, an, oxidizer, and, fuel, if, the, oxidizer, is, oxygen, from, the, surrounding, air, the, presence, of, a, force, of, gravity, or, of, some, similar, force, caused, by, acceleration, is, necessary, to, produce, convection, which, removes, combustion, products, and, brings, a, supply, of, oxygen, to, the, fire, without, gravity, a, fire, rapidly, surrounds, itself, with, its, own, combustion, products, and, non, oxidizing, gases, from, the, air, which, exclude, oxygen, and, extinguish, the, fire, because, of, this, the, risk, of, fire, in, a, spacecraft, is, small, when, it, is, coasting, in, inertial, flight, this, does, not, apply, if, oxygen, is, supplied, to, the, fire, by, some, process, other, than, thermal, convection, fire, can, be, extinguished, by, removing, any, one, of, the, elements, of, the, fire, tetrahedron, consider, a, natural, gas, flame, such, as, from, a, stove, top, burner, the, fire, can, be, extinguished, by, any, of, the, following, in, contrast, fire, is, intensified, by, increasing, the, overall, rate, of, combustion, methods, to, do, this, include, balancing, the, input, of, fuel, and, oxidizer, to, stoichiometric, proportions, increasing, fuel, and, oxidizer, input, in, this, balanced, mix, increasing, the, ambient, temperature, so, the, fire, s, own, heat, is, better, able, to, sustain, combustion, or, providing, a, catalyst, a, non, reactant, medium, in, which, the, fuel, and, oxidizer, can, more, readily, react, a, flame, is, a, mixture, of, reacting, gases, and, solids, emitting, visible, infrared, and, sometimes, ultraviolet, light, the, frequency, spectrum, of, which, depends, on, the, chemical, composition, of, the, burning, material, and, intermediate, reaction, products, in, many, cases, such, as, the, burning, of, organic, matter, for, example, wood, or, the, incomplete, combustion, of, gas, incandescent, solid, particles, called, soot, produce, the, familiar, red, orange, glow, of, fire, this, light, has, a, continuous, spectrum, complete, combustion, of, gas, has, a, dim, blue, color, due, to, the, emission, of, single, wavelength, radiation, from, various, electron, transitions, in, the, excited, molecules, formed, in, the, flame, usually, oxygen, is, involved, but, hydrogen, burning, in, chlorine, also, produces, a, flame, producing, hydrogen, chloride, hcl, other, possible, combinations, producing, flames, amongst, many, are, fluorine, and, hydrogen, and, hydrazine, and, nitrogen, tetroxide, hydrogen, and, hydrazine, udmh, flames, are, similarly, pale, blue, while, burning, boron, and, its, compounds, evaluated, in, mid, 20th, century, as, a, high, energy, fuel, for, jet, and, rocket, engines, emits, intense, green, flame, leading, to, its, informal, nickname, of, green, dragon, the, glow, of, a, flame, is, complex, black, body, radiation, is, emitted, from, soot, gas, and, fuel, particles, though, the, soot, particles, are, too, small, to, behave, like, perfect, blackbodies, there, is, also, photon, emission, by, de, excited, atoms, and, molecules, in, the, gases, much, of, the, radiation, is, emitted, in, the, visible, and, infrared, bands, the, color, depends, on, temperature, for, the, black, body, radiation, and, on, chemical, makeup, for, the, emission, spectra, the, common, distribution, of, a, flame, under, normal, gravity, conditions, depends, on, convection, as, soot, tends, to, rise, to, the, top, of, a, general, flame, as, in, a, candle, in, normal, gravity, conditions, making, it, yellow, in, micro, gravity, or, zero, gravity, such, as, an, environment, in, outer, space, convection, no, longer, occurs, and, the, flame, becomes, spherical, with, a, tendency, to, become, more, blue, and, more, efficient, although, it, may, go, out, if, not, moved, steadily, as, the, co, 2, from, combustion, does, not, disperse, as, readily, in, micro, gravity, and, tends, to, smother, the, flame, there, are, several, possible, explanations, for, this, difference, of, which, the, most, likely, is, that, the, temperature, is, sufficiently, evenly, distributed, that, soot, is, not, formed, and, complete, combustion, occurs, experiments, by, nasa, reveal, that, diffusion, flames, in, micro, gravity, allow, more, soot, to, be, completely, oxidized, after, they, are, produced, than, diffusion, flames, on, earth, because, of, a, series, of, mechanisms, that, behave, differently, in, micro, gravity, when, compared, to, normal, gravity, conditions, these, discoveries, have, potential, applications, in, applied, science, and, industry, especially, concerning, fuel, efficiency, the, adiabatic, flame, temperature, of, a, given, fuel, and, oxidizer, pair, is, that, at, which, the, gases, achieve, stable, combustion, fire, science, is, a, branch, of, physical, science, which, includes, fire, behavior, dynamics, and, combustion, applications, of, fire, science, include, fire, protection, fire, investigation, and, wildfire, management, every, natural, ecosystem, on, land, has, its, own, fire, regime, and, the, organisms, in, those, ecosystems, are, adapted, to, or, dependent, upon, that, fire, regime, fire, creates, a, mosaic, of, different, habitat, patches, each, at, a, different, stage, of, succession, different, species, of, plants, animals, and, microbes, specialize, in, exploiting, a, particular, stage, and, by, creating, these, different, types, of, patches, fire, allows, a, greater, number, of, species, to, exist, within, a, landscape, wildfire, prevention, programs, around, the, world, may, employ, techniques, such, as, wildland, fire, use, and, prescribed, or, controlled, burns, wildland, fire, use, refers, to, any, fire, of, natural, causes, that, is, monitored, but, allowed, to, burn, controlled, burns, are, fires, ignited, by, government, agencies, under, less, dangerous, weather, conditions, fire, fighting, services, are, provided, in, most, developed, areas, to, extinguish, or, contain, uncontrolled, fires, trained, firefighters, use, fire, apparatus, water, supply, resources, such, as, water, mains, and, fire, hydrants, or, they, might, use, a, and, b, class, foam, depending, on, what, is, feeding, the, fire, fire, prevention, is, intended, to, reduce, sources, of, ignition, fire, prevention, also, includes, education, to, teach, people, how, to, avoid, causing, fires, buildings, especially, schools, and, tall, buildings, often, conduct, fire, drills, to, inform, and, prepare, citizens, on, how, to, react, to, a, building, fire, purposely, starting, destructive, fires, constitutes, arson, and, is, a, crime, in, most, jurisdictions, model, building, codes, require, passive, fire, protection, and, active, fire, protection, systems, to, minimize, damage, resulting, from, a, fire, the, most, common, form, of, active, fire, protection, is, fire, sprinklers, to, maximize, passive, fire, protection, of, buildings, building, materials, and, furnishings, in, most, developed, countries, are, tested, for, fire, resistance, combustibility, and, flammability, upholstery, carpeting, and, plastics, used, in, vehicles, and, vessels, are, also, tested, where, fire, prevention, and, fire, protection, have, failed, to, prevent, damage, fire, insurance, can, mitigate, the, financial, impact
