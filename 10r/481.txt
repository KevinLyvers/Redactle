magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, is, a, medical, imaging, technique, used, in, radiology, to, form, pictures, of, the, anatomy, and, the, physiological, processes, inside, the, body, mri, scanners, use, strong, magnetic, fields, magnetic, field, gradients, and, radio, waves, to, generate, images, of, the, organs, in, the, body, mri, does, not, involve, x, rays, or, the, use, of, ionizing, radiation, which, distinguishes, it, from, computed, tomography, ct, and, positron, emission, tomography, pet, scans, mri, is, a, medical, application, of, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, which, can, also, be, used, for, imaging, in, other, nmr, applications, such, as, nmr, spectroscopy, mri, is, widely, used, in, hospitals, and, clinics, for, medical, diagnosis, staging, and, follow, up, of, disease, compared, to, ct, mri, provides, better, contrast, in, images, of, soft, tissues, e, g, in, the, brain, or, abdomen, however, it, may, be, perceived, as, less, comfortable, by, patients, due, to, the, usually, longer, and, louder, measurements, with, the, subject, in, a, long, confining, tube, although, open, mri, designs, mostly, relieve, this, additionally, implants, and, other, non, removable, metal, in, the, body, can, pose, a, risk, and, may, exclude, some, patients, from, undergoing, an, mri, examination, safely, mri, was, originally, called, nmri, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, imaging, but, nuclear, was, dropped, to, avoid, negative, associations, certain, atomic, nuclei, are, able, to, absorb, radio, frequency, rf, energy, when, placed, in, an, external, magnetic, field, the, resultant, evolving, spin, polarization, can, induce, an, rf, signal, in, a, radio, frequency, coil, and, thereby, be, detected, in, other, words, the, nuclear, magnetic, spin, of, protons, in, the, hydrogen, nuclei, resonates, with, the, rf, incident, waves, and, emit, coherent, radiation, with, compact, direction, energy, frequency, and, phase, this, coherent, amplified, radiation, is, easily, detected, by, rf, antenas, close, to, the, subject, being, examined, it, is, a, process, similar, to, masers, in, clinical, and, research, mri, hydrogen, atoms, are, most, often, used, to, generate, a, macroscopic, polarized, radiation, that, is, detected, by, the, antennas, hydrogen, atoms, are, naturally, abundant, in, humans, and, other, biological, organisms, particularly, in, water, and, fat, for, this, reason, most, mri, scans, essentially, map, the, location, of, water, and, fat, in, the, body, pulses, of, radio, waves, excite, the, nuclear, spin, energy, transition, and, magnetic, field, gradients, localize, the, polarization, in, space, by, varying, the, parameters, of, the, pulse, sequence, different, contrasts, may, be, generated, between, tissues, based, on, the, relaxation, properties, of, the, hydrogen, atoms, therein, since, its, development, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, mri, has, proven, to, be, a, versatile, imaging, technique, while, mri, is, most, prominently, used, in, diagnostic, medicine, and, biomedical, research, it, also, may, be, used, to, form, images, of, non, living, objects, such, as, mummies, diffusion, mri, and, functional, mri, extend, the, utility, of, mri, to, capture, neuronal, tracts, and, blood, flow, respectively, in, the, nervous, system, in, addition, to, detailed, spatial, images, the, sustained, increase, in, demand, for, mri, within, health, systems, has, led, to, concerns, about, cost, effectiveness, and, overdiagnosis, in, most, medical, applications, hydrogen, nuclei, which, consist, solely, of, a, proton, that, are, in, tissues, create, a, signal, that, is, processed, to, form, an, image, of, the, body, in, terms, of, the, density, of, those, nuclei, in, a, specific, region, given, that, the, protons, are, affected, by, fields, from, other, atoms, to, which, they, are, bonded, it, is, possible, to, separate, responses, from, hydrogen, in, specific, compounds, to, perform, a, study, the, person, is, positioned, within, an, mri, scanner, that, forms, a, strong, magnetic, field, around, the, area, to, be, imaged, first, energy, from, an, oscillating, magnetic, field, is, temporarily, applied, to, the, patient, at, the, appropriate, resonance, frequency, scanning, with, x, and, y, gradient, coils, causes, a, selected, region, of, the, patient, to, experience, the, exact, magnetic, field, required, for, the, energy, to, be, absorbed, the, atoms, are, excited, by, a, rf, pulse, and, the, resultant, signal, is, measured, by, a, receiving, coil, the, rf, signal, may, be, processed, to, deduce, position, information, by, looking, at, the, changes, in, rf, level, and, phase, caused, by, varying, the, local, magnetic, field, using, gradient, coils, as, these, coils, are, rapidly, switched, during, the, excitation, and, response, to, perform, a, moving, line, scan, they, create, the, characteristic, repetitive, noise, of, an, mri, scan, as, the, windings, move, slightly, due, to, magnetostriction, the, contrast, between, different, tissues, is, determined, by, the, rate, at, which, excited, atoms, return, to, the, equilibrium, state, exogenous, contrast, agents, may, be, given, to, the, person, to, make, the, image, clearer, the, major, components, of, an, mri, scanner, are, the, main, magnet, which, polarizes, the, sample, the, shim, coils, for, correcting, shifts, in, the, homogeneity, of, the, main, magnetic, field, the, gradient, system, which, is, used, to, localize, the, region, to, be, scanned, and, the, rf, system, which, excites, the, sample, and, detects, the, resulting, nmr, signal, the, whole, system, is, controlled, by, one, or, more, computers, mri, requires, a, magnetic, field, that, is, both, strong, and, uniform, to, a, few, parts, per, million, across, the, scan, volume, the, field, strength, of, the, magnet, is, measured, in, teslas, and, while, the, majority, of, systems, operate, at, 1, 5, t, commercial, systems, are, available, between, 0, 2, and, 7, t, whole, body, mri, systems, for, research, applications, operate, in, e, g, 9, 4t, 10, 5t, 11, 7t, even, higher, field, whole, body, mri, systems, e, g, 14, t, and, beyond, are, in, conceptual, proposal, or, in, engineering, design, most, clinical, magnets, are, superconducting, magnets, which, require, liquid, helium, to, keep, them, at, low, temperatures, lower, field, strengths, can, be, achieved, with, permanent, magnets, which, are, often, used, in, open, mri, scanners, for, claustrophobic, patients, lower, field, strengths, are, also, used, in, a, portable, mri, scanner, approved, by, the, fda, in, 2020, recently, mri, has, been, demonstrated, also, at, ultra, low, fields, i, e, in, the, microtesla, to, millitesla, range, where, sufficient, signal, quality, is, made, possible, by, prepolarization, on, the, order, of, 10, 100, mt, and, by, measuring, the, larmor, precession, fields, at, about, 100, microtesla, with, highly, sensitive, superconducting, quantum, interference, devices, squids, each, tissue, returns, to, its, equilibrium, state, after, excitation, by, the, independent, relaxation, processes, of, t, 1, spin, lattice, that, is, magnetization, in, the, same, direction, as, the, static, magnetic, field, and, t, 2, spin, spin, transverse, to, the, static, magnetic, field, to, create, a, t, 1, weighted, image, magnetization, is, allowed, to, recover, before, measuring, the, mr, signal, by, changing, the, repetition, time, tr, this, image, weighting, is, useful, for, assessing, the, cerebral, cortex, identifying, fatty, tissue, characterizing, focal, liver, lesions, and, in, general, obtaining, morphological, information, as, well, as, for, post, contrast, imaging, to, create, a, t, 2, weighted, image, magnetization, is, allowed, to, decay, before, measuring, the, mr, signal, by, changing, the, echo, time, te, this, image, weighting, is, useful, for, detecting, edema, and, inflammation, revealing, white, matter, lesions, and, assessing, zonal, anatomy, in, the, prostate, and, uterus, the, information, from, mri, scans, comes, in, the, form, of, image, contrasts, based, on, differences, in, the, rate, of, relaxation, of, nuclear, spins, following, their, perturbation, by, an, oscillating, magnetic, field, in, the, form, of, radiofrequency, pulses, through, the, sample, the, relaxation, rates, are, a, measure, of, the, time, it, takes, for, a, signal, to, decay, back, to, an, equilibrium, state, from, either, the, longitudinal, or, transverse, plane, magnetization, builds, up, along, the, z, axis, in, the, presence, of, a, magnetic, field, b, 0, such, that, the, magnetic, dipoles, in, the, sample, will, on, average, align, with, the, z, axis, summing, to, a, total, magnetization, m, z, this, magnetization, along, z, is, defined, as, the, equilibrium, magnetization, magnetization, is, defined, as, the, sum, of, all, magnetic, dipoles, in, a, sample, following, the, equilibrium, magnetization, a, 90, radiofrequency, rf, pulse, flips, the, direction, of, the, magnetization, vector, in, the, xy, plane, and, is, then, switched, off, the, initial, magnetic, field, b, 0, however, is, still, applied, thus, the, spin, magnetization, vector, will, slowly, return, from, the, xy, plane, back, to, the, equilibrium, state, the, time, it, takes, for, the, magnetization, vector, to, return, to, its, equilibrium, value, m, z, is, referred, to, as, the, longitudinal, relaxation, time, t, 1, subsequently, the, rate, at, which, this, happens, is, simply, the, reciprocal, of, the, relaxation, time, 1, t, 1, r, 1, displaystyle, frac, 1, t1, r1, similarly, the, time, in, which, it, takes, for, m, xy, to, return, to, zero, is, t, 2, with, the, rate, 1, t, 2, r, 2, displaystyle, frac, 1, t2, r2, magnetization, as, a, function, of, time, is, defined, by, the, bloch, equations, t, 1, and, t, 2, values, are, dependent, on, the, chemical, environment, of, the, sample, hence, their, utility, in, mri, soft, tissue, and, muscle, tissue, relax, at, different, rates, yielding, the, image, contrast, in, a, typical, scan, the, standard, display, of, mr, images, is, to, represent, fluid, characteristics, in, black, and, white, images, where, different, tissues, turn, out, as, follows, mri, has, a, wide, range, of, applications, in, medical, diagnosis, and, around, 50, 000, scanners, are, estimated, to, be, in, use, worldwide, mri, affects, diagnosis, and, treatment, in, many, specialties, although, the, effect, on, improved, health, outcomes, is, disputed, in, certain, cases, mri, is, the, investigation, of, choice, in, the, preoperative, staging, of, rectal, and, prostate, cancer, and, has, a, role, in, the, diagnosis, staging, and, follow, up, of, other, tumors, as, well, as, for, determining, areas, of, tissue, for, sampling, in, biobanking, mri, is, the, investigative, tool, of, choice, for, neurological, cancers, over, ct, as, it, offers, better, visualization, of, the, posterior, cranial, fossa, containing, the, brainstem, and, the, cerebellum, the, contrast, provided, between, grey, and, white, matter, makes, mri, the, best, choice, for, many, conditions, of, the, central, nervous, system, including, demyelinating, diseases, dementia, cerebrovascular, disease, infectious, diseases, alzheimer, s, disease, and, epilepsy, since, many, images, are, taken, milliseconds, apart, it, shows, how, the, brain, responds, to, different, stimuli, enabling, researchers, to, study, both, the, functional, and, structural, brain, abnormalities, in, psychological, disorders, mri, also, is, used, in, guided, stereotactic, surgery, and, radiosurgery, for, treatment, of, intracranial, tumors, arteriovenous, malformations, and, other, surgically, treatable, conditions, using, a, device, known, as, the, n, localizer, new, tools, that, implement, artificial, intelligence, in, healthcare, have, demonstrated, higher, image, quality, and, morphometric, analysis, in, neuroimaging, with, the, application, of, a, denoising, system, the, record, for, the, highest, spatial, resolution, of, a, whole, intact, brain, postmortem, is, 100, microns, from, massachusetts, general, hospital, the, data, was, published, in, nature, on, 30, october, 2019, though, mri, is, used, widely, in, research, on, mental, disabilities, based, on, a, 2024, systematic, literature, review, and, meta, analysis, commissioned, by, the, patient, centered, outcomes, research, institute, pcori, available, research, using, mri, scans, to, diagnose, adhd, showed, great, variability, the, authors, conclude, that, mri, cannot, be, reliably, used, to, assist, in, making, a, clinical, diagnosis, of, adhd, cardiac, mri, is, complementary, to, other, imaging, techniques, such, as, echocardiography, cardiac, ct, and, nuclear, medicine, it, can, be, used, to, assess, the, structure, and, the, function, of, the, heart, its, applications, include, assessment, of, myocardial, ischemia, and, viability, cardiomyopathies, myocarditis, iron, overload, vascular, diseases, and, congenital, heart, disease, applications, in, the, musculoskeletal, system, include, spinal, imaging, assessment, of, joint, disease, and, soft, tissue, tumors, also, mri, techniques, can, be, used, for, diagnostic, imaging, of, systemic, muscle, diseases, including, genetic, muscle, diseases, swallowing, movement, of, throat, and, oesophagus, can, cause, motion, artifact, over, the, imaged, spine, therefore, a, saturation, pulse, applied, over, this, region, the, throat, and, oesophagus, can, help, to, avoid, this, artifact, motion, artifact, arising, due, to, pumping, of, the, heart, can, be, reduced, by, timing, the, mri, pulse, according, to, heart, cycles, blood, vessels, flow, artifacts, can, be, reduced, by, applying, saturation, pulses, above, and, below, the, region, of, interest, hepatobiliary, mr, is, used, to, detect, and, characterize, lesions, of, the, liver, pancreas, and, bile, ducts, focal, or, diffuse, disorders, of, the, liver, may, be, evaluated, using, diffusion, weighted, opposed, phase, imaging, and, dynamic, contrast, enhancement, sequences, extracellular, contrast, agents, are, used, widely, in, liver, mri, and, newer, hepatobiliary, contrast, agents, also, provide, the, opportunity, to, perform, functional, biliary, imaging, anatomical, imaging, of, the, bile, ducts, is, achieved, by, using, a, heavily, t2, weighted, sequence, in, magnetic, resonance, cholangiopancreatography, mrcp, functional, imaging, of, the, pancreas, is, performed, following, administration, of, secretin, mr, enterography, provides, non, invasive, assessment, of, inflammatory, bowel, disease, and, small, bowel, tumors, mr, colonography, may, play, a, role, in, the, detection, of, large, polyps, in, patients, at, increased, risk, of, colorectal, cancer, magnetic, resonance, angiography, mra, generates, pictures, of, the, arteries, to, evaluate, them, for, stenosis, abnormal, narrowing, or, aneurysms, vessel, wall, dilatations, at, risk, of, rupture, mra, is, often, used, to, evaluate, the, arteries, of, the, neck, and, brain, the, thoracic, and, abdominal, aorta, the, renal, arteries, and, the, legs, called, a, run, off, a, variety, of, techniques, can, be, used, to, generate, the, pictures, such, as, administration, of, a, paramagnetic, contrast, agent, gadolinium, or, using, a, technique, known, as, flow, related, enhancement, e, g, 2d, and, 3d, time, of, flight, sequences, where, most, of, the, signal, on, an, image, is, due, to, blood, that, recently, moved, into, that, plane, see, also, flash, mri, techniques, involving, phase, accumulation, known, as, phase, contrast, angiography, can, also, be, used, to, generate, flow, velocity, maps, easily, and, accurately, magnetic, resonance, venography, mrv, is, a, similar, procedure, that, is, used, to, image, veins, in, this, method, the, tissue, is, now, excited, inferiorly, while, the, signal, is, gathered, in, the, plane, immediately, superior, to, the, excitation, plane, thus, imaging, the, venous, blood, that, recently, moved, from, the, excited, plane, mri, for, imaging, anatomical, structures, or, blood, flow, do, not, require, contrast, agents, since, the, varying, properties, of, the, tissues, or, blood, provide, natural, contrasts, however, for, more, specific, types, of, imaging, exogenous, contrast, agents, may, be, given, intravenously, orally, or, intra, articularly, most, contrast, agents, are, either, paramagnetic, e, g, gadolinium, manganese, europium, and, are, used, to, shorten, t1, in, the, tissue, they, accumulate, in, or, super, paramagnetic, spions, and, are, used, to, shorten, t2, and, t2, in, healthy, tissue, reducing, its, signal, intensity, negative, contrast, agents, the, most, commonly, used, intravenous, contrast, agents, are, based, on, chelates, of, gadolinium, which, is, highly, paramagnetic, in, general, these, agents, have, proved, safer, than, the, iodinated, contrast, agents, used, in, x, ray, radiography, or, ct, anaphylactoid, reactions, are, rare, occurring, in, approx, 0, 03, 0, 1, of, particular, interest, is, the, lower, incidence, of, nephrotoxicity, compared, with, iodinated, agents, when, given, at, usual, doses, this, has, made, contrast, enhanced, mri, scanning, an, option, for, patients, with, renal, impairment, who, would, otherwise, not, be, able, to, undergo, contrast, enhanced, ct, gadolinium, based, contrast, reagents, are, typically, octadentate, complexes, of, gadolinium, iii, the, complex, is, very, stable, log, k, 20, so, that, in, use, the, concentration, of, the, un, complexed, gd, 3, ions, should, be, below, the, toxicity, limit, the, 9th, place, in, the, metal, ion, s, coordination, sphere, is, occupied, by, a, water, molecule, which, exchanges, rapidly, with, water, molecules, in, the, reagent, molecule, s, immediate, environment, affecting, the, magnetic, resonance, relaxation, time, in, december, 2017, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, in, the, united, states, announced, in, a, drug, safety, communication, that, new, warnings, were, to, be, included, on, all, gadolinium, based, contrast, agents, gbcas, the, fda, also, called, for, increased, patient, education, and, requiring, gadolinium, contrast, vendors, to, conduct, additional, animal, and, clinical, studies, to, assess, the, safety, of, these, agents, although, gadolinium, agents, have, proved, useful, for, patients, with, kidney, impairment, in, patients, with, severe, kidney, failure, requiring, dialysis, there, is, a, risk, of, a, rare, but, serious, illness, nephrogenic, systemic, fibrosis, which, may, be, linked, to, the, use, of, certain, gadolinium, containing, agents, the, most, frequently, linked, is, gadodiamide, but, other, agents, have, been, linked, too, although, a, causal, link, has, not, been, definitively, established, current, guidelines, in, the, united, states, are, that, dialysis, patients, should, only, receive, gadolinium, agents, where, essential, and, that, dialysis, should, be, performed, as, soon, as, possible, after, the, scan, to, remove, the, agent, from, the, body, promptly, in, europe, where, more, gadolinium, containing, agents, are, available, a, classification, of, agents, according, to, potential, risks, has, been, released, in, 2008, a, new, contrast, agent, named, gadoxetate, brand, name, eovist, us, or, primovist, eu, was, approved, for, diagnostic, use, this, has, the, theoretical, benefit, of, a, dual, excretion, path, an, mri, sequence, is, a, particular, setting, of, radiofrequency, pulses, and, gradients, resulting, in, a, particular, image, appearance, the, t1, and, t2, weighting, can, also, be, described, as, mri, sequences, edit, this, table, does, not, include, uncommon, and, experimental, sequences, standard, foundation, and, comparison, for, other, sequences, standard, foundation, and, comparison, for, other, sequences, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, mrs, is, used, to, measure, the, levels, of, different, metabolites, in, body, tissues, which, can, be, achieved, through, a, variety, of, single, voxel, or, imaging, based, techniques, the, mr, signal, produces, a, spectrum, of, resonances, that, corresponds, to, different, molecular, arrangements, of, the, isotope, being, excited, this, signature, is, used, to, diagnose, certain, metabolic, disorders, especially, those, affecting, the, brain, and, to, provide, information, on, tumor, metabolism, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopic, imaging, mrsi, combines, both, spectroscopic, and, imaging, methods, to, produce, spatially, localized, spectra, from, within, the, sample, or, patient, the, spatial, resolution, is, much, lower, limited, by, the, available, snr, but, the, spectra, in, each, voxel, contains, information, about, many, metabolites, because, the, available, signal, is, used, to, encode, spatial, and, spectral, information, mrsi, requires, high, snr, achievable, only, at, higher, field, strengths, 3, t, and, above, the, high, procurement, and, maintenance, costs, of, mri, with, extremely, high, field, strengths, inhibit, their, popularity, however, recent, compressed, sensing, based, software, algorithms, e, g, samv, have, been, proposed, to, achieve, super, resolution, without, requiring, such, high, field, strengths, real, time, magnetic, resonance, imaging, rt, mri, refers, to, the, continuous, monitoring, of, moving, objects, in, real, time, traditionally, real, time, mri, was, possible, only, with, low, image, quality, or, low, temporal, resolution, an, iterative, reconstruction, algorithm, removed, limitations, radial, flash, mri, real, time, yields, a, temporal, resolution, of, 20, to, 30, milliseconds, for, images, with, an, in, plane, resolution, of, 1, 5, to, 2, 0, mm, real, time, mri, adds, information, about, diseases, of, the, joints, and, the, heart, in, many, cases, mri, examinations, become, easier, and, more, comfortable, for, patients, especially, for, the, patients, who, cannot, calm, their, breathing, or, who, have, arrhythmia, the, lack, of, harmful, effects, on, the, patient, and, the, operator, make, mri, well, suited, for, interventional, radiology, where, the, images, produced, by, an, mri, scanner, guide, minimally, invasive, procedures, such, procedures, use, no, ferromagnetic, instruments, a, specialized, growing, subset, of, interventional, mri, is, intraoperative, mri, in, which, an, mri, is, used, in, surgery, some, specialized, mri, systems, allow, imaging, concurrent, with, the, surgical, procedure, more, typically, the, surgical, procedure, is, temporarily, interrupted, so, that, mri, can, assess, the, success, of, the, procedure, or, guide, subsequent, surgical, work, in, guided, therapy, high, intensity, focused, ultrasound, hifu, beams, are, focused, on, a, tissue, that, are, controlled, using, mr, thermal, imaging, due, to, the, high, energy, at, the, focus, the, temperature, rises, to, above, 65, c, 150, f, which, completely, destroys, the, tissue, this, technology, can, achieve, precise, ablation, of, diseased, tissue, mr, imaging, provides, a, three, dimensional, view, of, the, target, tissue, allowing, for, the, precise, focusing, of, ultrasound, energy, the, mr, imaging, provides, quantitative, real, time, thermal, images, of, the, treated, area, this, allows, the, physician, to, ensure, that, the, temperature, generated, during, each, cycle, of, ultrasound, energy, is, sufficient, to, cause, thermal, ablation, within, the, desired, tissue, and, if, not, to, adapt, the, parameters, to, ensure, effective, treatment, hydrogen, has, the, most, frequently, imaged, nucleus, in, mri, because, it, is, present, in, biological, tissues, in, great, abundance, and, because, its, high, gyromagnetic, ratio, gives, a, strong, signal, however, any, nucleus, with, a, net, nuclear, spin, could, potentially, be, imaged, with, mri, such, nuclei, include, helium, 3, lithium, 7, carbon, 13, fluorine, 19, oxygen, 17, sodium, 23, phosphorus, 31, and, xenon, 129, 23, na, and, 31, p, are, naturally, abundant, in, the, body, so, they, can, be, imaged, directly, gaseous, isotopes, such, as, 3, he, or, 129, xe, must, be, hyperpolarized, and, then, inhaled, as, their, nuclear, density, is, too, low, to, yield, a, useful, signal, under, normal, conditions, 17, o, and, 19, f, can, be, administered, in, sufficient, quantities, in, liquid, form, e, g, 17, o, water, that, hyperpolarization, is, not, a, necessity, using, helium, or, xenon, has, the, advantage, of, reduced, background, noise, and, therefore, increased, contrast, for, the, image, itself, because, these, elements, are, not, normally, present, in, biological, tissues, moreover, the, nucleus, of, any, atom, that, has, a, net, nuclear, spin, and, that, is, bonded, to, a, hydrogen, atom, could, potentially, be, imaged, via, heteronuclear, magnetization, transfer, mri, that, would, image, the, high, gyromagnetic, ratio, hydrogen, nucleus, instead, of, the, low, gyromagnetic, ratio, nucleus, that, is, bonded, to, the, hydrogen, atom, in, principle, heteronuclear, magnetization, transfer, mri, could, be, used, to, detect, the, presence, or, absence, of, specific, chemical, bonds, multinuclear, imaging, is, primarily, a, research, technique, at, present, however, potential, applications, include, functional, imaging, and, imaging, of, organs, poorly, seen, on, 1, h, mri, e, g, lungs, and, bones, or, as, alternative, contrast, agents, inhaled, hyperpolarized, 3, he, can, be, used, to, image, the, distribution, of, air, spaces, within, the, lungs, injectable, solutions, containing, 13, c, or, stabilized, bubbles, of, hyperpolarized, 129, xe, have, been, studied, as, contrast, agents, for, angiography, and, perfusion, imaging, 31, p, can, potentially, provide, information, on, bone, density, and, structure, as, well, as, functional, imaging, of, the, brain, multinuclear, imaging, holds, the, potential, to, chart, the, distribution, of, lithium, in, the, human, brain, this, element, finding, use, as, an, important, drug, for, those, with, conditions, such, as, bipolar, disorder, mri, has, the, advantages, of, having, very, high, spatial, resolution, and, is, very, adept, at, morphological, imaging, and, functional, imaging, mri, does, have, several, disadvantages, though, first, mri, has, a, sensitivity, of, around, 10, 3, mol, l, to, 10, 5, mol, l, which, compared, to, other, types, of, imaging, can, be, very, limiting, this, problem, stems, from, the, fact, that, the, population, difference, between, the, nuclear, spin, states, is, very, small, at, room, temperature, for, example, at, 1, 5, teslas, a, typical, field, strength, for, clinical, mri, the, difference, between, high, and, low, energy, states, is, approximately, 9, molecules, per, 2, million, improvements, to, increase, mr, sensitivity, include, increasing, magnetic, field, strength, and, hyperpolarization, via, optical, pumping, or, dynamic, nuclear, polarization, there, are, also, a, variety, of, signal, amplification, schemes, based, on, chemical, exchange, that, increase, sensitivity, to, achieve, molecular, imaging, of, disease, biomarkers, using, mri, targeted, mri, contrast, agents, with, high, specificity, and, high, relaxivity, sensitivity, are, required, to, date, many, studies, have, been, devoted, to, developing, targeted, mri, contrast, agents, to, achieve, molecular, imaging, by, mri, commonly, peptides, antibodies, or, small, ligands, and, small, protein, domains, such, as, her, 2, affibodies, have, been, applied, to, achieve, targeting, to, enhance, the, sensitivity, of, the, contrast, agents, these, targeting, moieties, are, usually, linked, to, high, payload, mri, contrast, agents, or, mri, contrast, agents, with, high, relaxivities, a, new, class, of, gene, targeting, mr, contrast, agents, has, been, introduced, to, show, gene, action, of, unique, mrna, and, gene, transcription, factor, proteins, these, new, contrast, agents, can, trace, cells, with, unique, mrna, microrna, and, virus, tissue, response, to, inflammation, in, living, brains, the, mr, reports, change, in, gene, expression, with, positive, correlation, to, taqman, analysis, optical, and, electron, microscopy, it, takes, time, to, gather, mri, data, using, sequential, applications, of, magnetic, field, gradients, even, for, the, most, streamlined, of, mri, sequences, there, are, physical, and, physiologic, limits, to, the, rate, of, gradient, switching, parallel, mri, circumvents, these, limits, by, gathering, some, portion, of, the, data, simultaneously, rather, than, in, a, traditional, sequential, fashion, this, is, accomplished, using, arrays, of, radiofrequency, rf, detector, coils, each, with, a, different, view, of, the, body, a, reduced, set, of, gradient, steps, is, applied, and, the, remaining, spatial, information, is, filled, in, by, combining, signals, from, various, coils, based, on, their, known, spatial, sensitivity, patterns, the, resulting, acceleration, is, limited, by, the, number, of, coils, and, by, the, signal, to, noise, ratio, which, decreases, with, increasing, acceleration, but, two, to, four, fold, accelerations, may, commonly, be, achieved, with, suitable, coil, array, configurations, and, substantially, higher, accelerations, have, been, demonstrated, with, specialized, coil, arrays, parallel, mri, may, be, used, with, most, mri, sequences, after, a, number, of, early, suggestions, for, using, arrays, of, detectors, to, accelerate, imaging, went, largely, unremarked, in, the, mri, field, parallel, imaging, saw, widespread, development, and, application, following, the, introduction, of, the, simultaneous, acquisition, of, spatial, harmonics, smash, technique, in, 1996, 7, the, sensitivity, encoding, sense, and, generalized, autocalibrating, partially, parallel, acquisitions, grappa, techniques, are, the, parallel, imaging, methods, in, most, common, use, today, the, advent, of, parallel, mri, resulted, in, extensive, research, and, development, in, image, reconstruction, and, rf, coil, design, as, well, as, in, a, rapid, expansion, of, the, number, of, receiver, channels, available, on, commercial, mr, systems, parallel, mri, is, now, used, routinely, for, mri, examinations, in, a, wide, range, of, body, areas, and, clinical, or, research, applications, most, mri, focuses, on, qualitative, interpretation, of, mr, data, by, acquiring, spatial, maps, of, relative, variations, in, signal, strength, which, are, weighted, by, certain, parameters, quantitative, methods, instead, attempt, to, determine, spatial, maps, of, accurate, tissue, relaxometry, parameter, values, or, magnetic, field, or, to, measure, the, size, of, certain, spatial, features, examples, of, quantitative, mri, methods, are, quantitative, mri, aims, to, increase, the, reproducibility, of, mr, images, and, interpretations, but, has, historically, require, longer, scan, times, quantitative, mri, or, qmri, sometimes, more, specifically, refers, to, multi, parametric, quantitative, mri, the, mapping, of, multiple, tissue, relaxometry, parameters, in, a, single, imaging, session, efforts, to, make, multi, parametric, quantitative, mri, faster, have, produced, sequences, which, map, multiple, parameters, simultaneously, either, by, building, separate, encoding, methods, for, each, parameter, into, the, sequence, or, by, fitting, mr, signal, evolution, to, a, multi, parameter, model, traditional, mri, generates, poor, images, of, lung, tissue, because, there, are, fewer, water, molecules, with, protons, that, can, be, excited, by, the, magnetic, field, using, hyperpolarized, gas, an, mri, scan, can, identify, ventilation, defects, in, the, lungs, before, the, scan, a, patient, is, asked, to, inhale, hyperpolarized, xenon, mixed, with, a, buffer, gas, of, helium, or, nitrogen, the, resulting, lung, images, are, much, higher, quality, than, with, traditional, mri, mri, is, in, general, a, safe, technique, although, injuries, may, occur, as, a, result, of, failed, safety, procedures, or, human, error, contraindications, to, mri, include, most, cochlear, implants, and, cardiac, pacemakers, shrapnel, and, metallic, foreign, bodies, in, the, eyes, magnetic, resonance, imaging, in, pregnancy, appears, to, be, safe, at, least, during, the, second, and, third, trimesters, if, done, without, contrast, agents, since, mri, does, not, use, any, ionizing, radiation, its, use, is, generally, favored, in, preference, to, ct, when, either, modality, could, yield, the, same, information, some, patients, experience, claustrophobia, and, may, require, sedation, or, shorter, mri, protocols, amplitude, and, rapid, switching, of, gradient, coils, during, image, acquisition, may, cause, peripheral, nerve, stimulation, mri, uses, powerful, magnets, and, can, therefore, cause, magnetic, materials, to, move, at, great, speeds, posing, a, projectile, risk, and, may, cause, fatal, accidents, however, as, millions, of, mris, are, performed, globally, each, year, fatalities, are, extremely, rare, mri, machines, can, produce, loud, noise, up, to, 120, db, a, this, can, cause, hearing, loss, tinnitus, and, hyperacusis, so, appropriate, hearing, protection, is, essential, for, anyone, inside, the, mri, scanner, room, during, the, examination, medical, societies, issue, guidelines, for, when, physicians, should, use, mri, on, patients, and, recommend, against, overuse, mri, can, detect, health, problems, or, confirm, a, diagnosis, but, medical, societies, often, recommend, that, mri, not, be, the, first, procedure, for, creating, a, plan, to, diagnose, or, manage, a, patient, s, complaint, a, common, case, is, to, use, mri, to, seek, a, cause, of, low, back, pain, the, american, college, of, physicians, for, example, recommends, against, imaging, including, mri, as, unlikely, to, result, in, a, positive, outcome, for, the, patient, an, mri, artifact, is, a, visual, artifact, that, is, an, anomaly, during, visual, representation, many, different, artifacts, can, occur, during, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, some, affecting, the, diagnostic, quality, while, others, may, be, confused, with, pathology, artifacts, can, be, classified, as, patient, related, signal, processing, dependent, and, hardware, machine, related, mri, is, used, industrially, mainly, for, routine, analysis, of, chemicals, the, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, technique, is, also, used, for, example, to, measure, the, ratio, between, water, and, fat, in, foods, monitoring, of, flow, of, corrosive, fluids, in, pipes, or, to, study, molecular, structures, such, as, catalysts, being, non, invasive, and, non, damaging, mri, can, be, used, to, study, the, anatomy, of, plants, their, water, transportation, processes, and, water, balance, it, is, also, applied, to, veterinary, radiology, for, diagnostic, purposes, outside, this, its, use, in, zoology, is, limited, due, to, the, high, cost, but, it, can, be, used, on, many, species, in, palaeontology, it, is, used, to, examine, the, structure, of, fossils, forensic, imaging, provides, graphic, documentation, of, an, autopsy, which, manual, autopsy, does, not, ct, scanning, provides, quick, whole, body, imaging, of, skeletal, and, parenchymal, alterations, whereas, mr, imaging, gives, better, representation, of, soft, tissue, pathology, all, that, being, said, mri, is, more, expensive, and, more, time, consuming, to, utilize, moreover, the, quality, of, mr, imaging, deteriorates, below, 10, c, in, 1971, at, stony, brook, university, paul, lauterbur, applied, magnetic, field, gradients, in, all, three, dimensions, and, a, back, projection, technique, to, create, nmr, images, he, published, the, first, images, of, two, tubes, of, water, in, 1973, in, the, journal, nature, followed, by, the, picture, of, a, living, animal, a, clam, and, in, 1974, by, the, image, of, the, thoracic, cavity, of, a, mouse, lauterbur, called, his, imaging, method, zeugmatography, a, term, which, was, replaced, by, n, mr, imaging, in, the, late, 1970s, physicists, peter, mansfield, and, paul, lauterbur, developed, mri, related, techniques, like, the, echo, planar, imaging, epi, technique, raymond, damadian, s, work, into, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, nmr, has, been, incorporated, into, mri, having, built, one, of, the, first, scanners, advances, in, semiconductor, technology, were, crucial, to, the, development, of, practical, mri, which, requires, a, large, amount, of, computational, power, this, was, made, possible, by, the, rapidly, increasing, number, of, transistors, on, a, single, integrated, circuit, chip, mansfield, and, lauterbur, were, awarded, the, 2003, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, their, discoveries, concerning, magnetic, resonance, imaging
