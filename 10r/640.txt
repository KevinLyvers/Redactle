linen, l, n, n, is, a, textile, made, from, the, fibers, of, the, flax, plant, linen, is, very, strong, and, absorbent, and, dries, faster, than, cotton, because, of, these, properties, linen, is, comfortable, to, wear, in, hot, weather, and, is, valued, for, use, in, garments, linen, textiles, can, be, made, from, flax, plant, fiber, yarn, as, well, as, woven, and, knitted, linen, also, has, other, distinctive, characteristics, such, as, its, tendency, to, wrinkle, it, s, also, hypoallergenic, which, makes, it, a, better, material, for, people, with, allergies, or, chemical, sensitivities, it, takes, significantly, longer, to, harvest, than, a, material, like, cotton, although, both, are, natural, fibers, it, is, also, more, difficult, to, weave, than, cotton, linen, textiles, appear, to, be, some, of, the, oldest, in, the, world, their, history, goes, back, many, thousands, of, years, dyed, flax, fibers, found, in, a, cave, in, southeastern, europe, present, day, georgia, suggest, the, use, of, woven, linen, fabrics, from, wild, flax, may, date, back, over, 30, 000, years, linen, was, used, in, ancient, civilizations, including, mesopotamia, and, ancient, egypt, and, linen, is, mentioned, in, the, bible, in, the, 18th, century, and, beyond, the, linen, industry, was, important, in, the, economies, of, several, countries, in, europe, as, well, as, the, american, colonies, textiles, in, a, linen, weave, texture, even, when, made, of, cotton, hemp, or, other, non, flax, fibers, are, also, loosely, referred, to, as, linen, the, word, linen, is, of, west, germanic, origin, and, cognate, to, the, latin, name, for, the, flax, plant, linum, and, the, earlier, greek, lin, n, this, word, history, has, given, rise, to, a, number, of, other, terms, in, english, most, notably, line, from, the, use, of, a, linen, flax, thread, to, determine, a, straight, line, it, is, also, etymologically, related, to, a, number, of, other, terms, including, lining, because, linen, was, often, used, to, create, an, inner, layer, for, clothing, and, lingerie, from, french, which, originally, denoted, underwear, made, of, linen, people, in, various, parts, of, the, world, began, weaving, linen, at, least, several, thousand, years, ago, it, was, also, recovered, from, qumran, cave, 1, near, the, dead, sea, the, discovery, of, dyed, flax, fibers, in, a, cave, in, southern, caucasus, west, asia, modern, day, country, georgia, dated, to, 36, 000, years, ago, suggests, that, ancient, people, used, wild, flax, fibers, to, create, linen, like, fabrics, from, an, early, date, fragments, of, straw, seeds, fibers, yarns, and, various, types, of, fabrics, including, linen, samples, dating, to, about, 8, 000, bc, have, been, found, in, swiss, lake, dwellings, woven, flax, textile, fragments, have, been, found, between, infant, and, child, in, a, burial, at, atalh, y, k, a, large, settlement, dating, to, around, 7, 000, bc, to, the, southeast, in, ancient, mesopotamia, flax, was, domesticated, and, linen, was, produced, it, was, used, mainly, by, the, wealthier, class, of, the, society, including, priests, the, sumerian, poem, of, the, courtship, of, inanna, mentions, flax, and, linen, in, ancient, egypt, linen, was, used, for, mummification, and, for, burial, shrouds, it, was, also, worn, as, clothing, on, a, daily, basis, white, linen, was, worn, because, of, the, extreme, heat, for, example, the, tarkhan, dress, considered, to, be, among, the, oldest, woven, garments, in, the, world, and, dated, to, between, 3482, and, 3102, bc, is, made, of, linen, plutarch, wrote, that, the, priests, of, isis, also, wore, linen, because, of, its, purity, linen, was, sometimes, used, as, a, form, of, currency, in, ancient, egypt, egyptian, mummies, were, wrapped, in, linen, as, a, symbol, of, light, and, purity, and, as, a, display, of, wealth, some, of, these, fabrics, woven, from, hand, spun, yarns, were, very, fine, for, their, day, but, are, coarse, compared, with, modern, linen, when, the, tomb, of, the, pharaoh, ramses, ii, who, died, in, 1213, bc, was, discovered, in, 1881, the, linen, wrappings, were, in, a, state, of, perfect, preservation, after, more, than, 3000, years, in, the, ulster, museum, belfast, there, is, the, mummy, of, takabuti, the, daughter, of, a, priest, of, amun, who, died, 2, 500, years, ago, the, linen, on, this, mummy, is, also, in, a, perfect, state, of, preservation, the, earliest, written, documentation, of, a, linen, industry, comes, from, the, linear, b, tablets, of, pylos, greece, where, linen, is, depicted, as, an, ideogram, and, also, written, as, li, no, greek, linon, and, the, female, linen, workers, are, cataloged, as, li, ne, ya, lineia, by, the, middle, ages, there, was, a, thriving, trade, in, german, flax, and, linen, the, trade, spread, throughout, germany, by, the, 9th, century, and, spread, to, flanders, and, brabant, by, the, 11th, century, the, lower, rhine, was, a, center, of, linen, making, in, the, middle, ages, flax, was, cultivated, and, linen, used, for, clothing, in, ireland, by, the, 11th, century, evidence, suggests, that, flax, may, have, been, grown, and, sold, in, southern, england, in, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, textiles, primarily, linen, and, wool, were, produced, in, decentralized, home, weaving, mills, linen, continued, to, be, valued, for, garments, in, the, 16th, century, and, beyond, specimens, of, linen, garments, worn, by, historical, figures, have, survived, for, example, a, linen, cap, worn, by, emperor, charles, v, was, carefully, preserved, after, his, death, in, 1558, there, is, a, long, history, of, the, production, of, linen, in, ireland, when, the, edict, of, nantes, was, revoked, in, 1685, many, of, the, huguenots, who, fled, france, settled, in, the, british, isles, and, elsewhere, they, brought, improved, methods, for, linen, production, with, them, contributing, to, the, growth, of, the, linen, industry, in, ireland, in, particular, among, them, was, louis, crommelin, a, leader, who, was, appointed, overseer, of, the, royal, linen, manufacture, of, ireland, he, settled, in, the, town, of, lisburn, near, belfast, which, is, itself, perhaps, the, most, famous, linen, producing, center, throughout, history, during, the, victorian, era, the, majority, of, the, world, s, linen, was, produced, in, the, city, which, gained, it, the, name, linenopolis, although, the, linen, industry, was, already, established, in, ulster, louis, crommelin, found, scope, for, improvement, in, weaving, and, his, efforts, were, so, successful, that, he, was, appointed, by, the, government, to, develop, the, industry, over, a, much, wider, range, than, the, small, confines, of, lisburn, and, its, surroundings, the, direct, result, of, his, good, work, was, the, establishment, under, statute, of, the, board, of, trustees, of, the, linen, manufacturers, of, ireland, in, the, year, 1711, several, grades, were, produced, including, coarse, lockram, the, living, linen, project, was, set, up, in, 1995, as, an, oral, archive, of, the, knowledge, of, the, irish, linen, industry, which, was, at, that, time, still, available, within, a, nucleus, of, people, who, formerly, worked, in, the, industry, in, ulster, the, linen, industry, was, increasingly, critical, in, the, economies, of, europe, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, in, england, and, then, in, germany, industrialization, and, machine, production, replaced, manual, work, and, production, moved, from, the, home, to, new, factories, linen, was, also, an, important, product, in, the, american, colonies, where, it, was, brought, over, with, the, first, settlers, and, became, the, most, commonly, used, fabric, and, a, valuable, asset, for, colonial, households, the, homespun, movement, encouraged, the, use, of, flax, to, make, home, spun, textiles, through, the, 1830s, most, farmers, in, the, northern, united, states, continued, to, grow, flax, for, linen, to, be, used, for, the, family, s, clothing, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, linen, was, very, significant, to, russia, and, its, economy, at, one, time, it, was, the, country, s, greatest, export, item, and, russia, produced, about, 80, of, the, world, s, fiber, flax, crop, in, december, 2006, the, general, assembly, of, the, united, nations, proclaimed, 2009, to, be, the, international, year, of, natural, fibres, in, order, to, raise, people, s, awareness, of, linen, and, other, natural, fibers, one, study, suggests, that, the, functional, properties, of, linen, fabric, can, be, improved, by, incorporating, chitosan, citric, acid, and, phytic, acid, thiourea, the, effects, of, this, process, include, improved, levels, of, antibacterial, activity, increased, wrinkle, resistance, flame, retardancy, uv, protection, and, antioxidant, properties, additionally, the, linen, fabric, was, able, to, retain, durability, for, about, 20, washes, there, are, many, references, to, linen, throughout, the, bible, reflecting, the, textile, s, entrenched, presence, in, human, cultures, in, judaism, the, only, law, concerning, which, fabrics, may, be, interwoven, together, in, clothing, concerns, the, mixture, of, linen, and, wool, called, shaatnez, it, is, restricted, in, deuteronomy, 22, 11, thou, shalt, not, wear, a, mingled, stuff, wool, and, linen, together, and, leviticus, 19, 19, neither, shall, there, come, upon, thee, a, garment, of, two, kinds, of, stuff, mingled, together, there, is, no, explanation, for, this, in, the, torah, itself, and, it, is, categorized, as, a, type, of, law, known, as, chukim, a, statute, beyond, man, s, ability, to, comprehend, first, century, romano, jewish, historian, josephus, suggested, that, the, reason, for, the, prohibition, was, to, keep, the, laity, from, wearing, the, official, garb, of, the, priests, while, medieval, sephardic, jewish, philosopher, maimonides, thought, that, the, reason, was, that, heathen, priests, wore, such, mixed, garments, others, explain, that, it, is, because, god, often, forbids, mixtures, of, disparate, kinds, not, designed, by, god, to, be, compatible, in, a, certain, way, with, mixing, animal, and, vegetable, fibers, being, similar, to, having, two, different, types, of, plowing, animals, yoked, together, also, such, commands, serve, both, a, practical, as, well, as, allegorical, purpose, perhaps, here, preventing, a, priestly, garment, that, would, cause, discomfort, or, excessive, sweat, in, a, hot, climate, linen, is, also, mentioned, in, the, bible, in, proverbs, 31, a, passage, describing, a, noble, wife, proverbs, 31, 22, says, she, makes, coverings, for, her, bed, she, is, clothed, in, fine, linen, and, purple, fine, white, linen, is, also, worn, by, angels, in, the, new, testament, revelation, 15, 6, in, the, book, of, joshua, rahab, a, prostitute, in, jericho, hides, two, israelite, spies, under, bundles, of, flax, many, products, can, be, made, with, linen, such, as, clothing, bed, sheets, aprons, bags, towels, swimming, bath, beach, body, and, wash, towels, napkins, runners, and, upholstery, it, is, used, especially, in, sailcloth, and, lent, cloth, sewing, threads, handkerchiefs, table, cloth, sheets, collars, cuffs, etc, today, linen, is, usually, an, expensive, textile, produced, in, relatively, small, quantities, it, has, a, long, staple, individual, fiber, length, relative, to, cotton, and, other, natural, fibers, linen, fabric, has, been, used, for, table, coverings, bed, coverings, and, clothing, for, centuries, the, significant, cost, of, linen, derives, not, only, from, the, difficulty, of, working, with, the, thread, but, also, because, the, flax, plant, itself, requires, a, great, deal, of, attention, in, addition, flax, thread, is, not, elastic, and, therefore, it, is, difficult, to, weave, without, breaking, threads, thus, linen, is, considerably, more, expensive, to, manufacture, than, cotton, the, collective, term, linens, is, still, often, used, generically, to, describe, a, class, of, woven, or, knitted, bed, bath, table, and, kitchen, textiles, traditionally, made, of, flax, based, linen, but, today, made, from, a, variety, of, fibers, the, term, linens, refers, to, lightweight, undergarments, such, as, shirts, chemises, waist, shirts, lingerie, a, cognate, with, linen, and, detachable, shirt, collars, and, cuffs, all, of, which, were, historically, made, almost, exclusively, out, of, linen, the, inner, layer, of, fine, composite, cloth, garments, as, for, example, dress, jackets, was, traditionally, made, of, linen, hence, the, word, lining, over, the, past, 30, years, the, end, use, for, linen, has, changed, dramatically, approximately, 70, of, linen, production, in, the, 1990s, was, for, apparel, textiles, whereas, in, the, 1970s, only, about, 5, was, used, for, fashion, fabrics, linen, uses, range, across, bed, and, bath, fabrics, tablecloths, bath, towels, dish, towels, bed, sheets, home, and, commercial, furnishing, items, wallpaper, wall, coverings, upholstery, window, treatments, apparel, items, suits, dresses, skirts, shirts, and, industrial, products, luggage, canvases, sewing, thread, it, was, once, the, preferred, yarn, for, hand, sewing, the, uppers, of, moccasin, style, shoes, loafers, but, has, been, replaced, by, synthetics, a, linen, handkerchief, pressed, and, folded, to, display, the, corners, was, a, standard, decoration, of, a, well, dressed, man, s, suit, during, most, of, the, first, part, of, the, 20th, century, nowadays, linen, is, one, of, the, most, preferred, materials, for, bed, sheets, due, to, its, durability, and, hypoallergenic, properties, linen, can, be, up, to, three, times, stronger, than, cotton, this, is, because, the, cellulose, fibers, in, linen, yarn, are, slightly, longer, and, wrapped, tighter, than, those, found, in, cotton, yarn, this, gives, it, great, durability, and, allows, linen, products, to, be, long, lasting, currently, researchers, are, working, on, a, cotton, flax, blend, to, create, new, yarns, which, will, improve, the, feel, of, denim, during, hot, and, humid, weather, conversely, some, brands, such, as, 100, capri, specially, treat, the, linen, to, look, like, denim, linen, fabric, is, one, of, the, preferred, traditional, supports, for, oil, painting, in, the, united, states, cotton, is, popularly, used, instead, as, linen, is, many, times, more, expensive, there, restricting, its, use, to, professional, painters, in, europe, however, linen, is, usually, the, only, fabric, support, available, in, art, shops, in, the, uk, both, are, freely, available, with, cotton, being, cheaper, linen, is, preferred, to, cotton, for, its, strength, durability, and, archival, integrity, linen, is, also, used, extensively, by, artisan, bakers, known, as, a, couche, the, flax, cloth, is, used, to, hold, the, dough, into, shape, while, in, the, final, rise, just, before, baking, the, couche, is, heavily, dusted, with, flour, which, is, rubbed, into, the, pores, of, the, fabric, then, the, shaped, dough, is, placed, on, the, couche, the, floured, couche, makes, a, non, stick, surface, to, hold, the, dough, then, ridges, are, formed, in, the, couche, to, keep, the, dough, from, spreading, in, the, past, linen, was, also, used, for, books, the, only, surviving, example, of, which, is, the, liber, linteus, due, to, its, strength, in, the, middle, ages, linen, was, used, for, shields, gambesons, and, bowstrings, in, classical, antiquity, it, was, used, to, make, a, type, of, body, armour, referred, to, as, a, linothorax, additionally, linen, was, commonly, used, to, make, riggings, sail, cloths, nets, ropes, and, canvases, because, the, tensility, of, the, cloth, would, increase, by, 20, when, wet, because, of, its, strength, when, wet, irish, linen, is, a, very, popular, wrap, of, pool, billiard, cues, due, to, its, absorption, of, sweat, from, hands, in, 1923, the, german, city, bielefeld, issued, banknotes, printed, on, linen, united, states, currency, paper, is, made, from, 25, linen, and, 75, cotton, linen, is, a, bast, fiber, flax, fibers, vary, in, length, from, about, 25, to, 150, mm, 1, to, 6, in, and, average, 12, 16, micrometers, in, diameter, there, are, two, varieties, shorter, tow, fibers, used, for, coarser, fabrics, and, longer, line, fibers, used, for, finer, fabrics, flax, fibers, can, usually, be, identified, by, their, nodes, which, add, to, the, flexibility, and, texture, of, the, fabric, the, cross, section, of, the, linen, fiber, is, made, up, of, irregular, polygonal, shapes, which, contribute, to, the, coarse, texture, of, the, fabric, linen, fabric, feels, cool, to, touch, a, phenomenon, which, indicates, its, higher, conductivity, the, same, principle, that, makes, metals, feel, cold, it, is, smooth, making, the, finished, fabric, lint, free, and, gets, softer, the, more, it, is, washed, however, constant, creasing, in, the, same, place, in, sharp, folds, will, tend, to, break, the, linen, threads, this, wear, can, show, up, in, collars, hems, and, any, area, that, is, iron, creased, during, laundering, linen, s, poor, elasticity, means, that, it, easily, wrinkles, mildew, perspiration, and, bleach, can, damage, the, fabric, but, because, it, is, not, made, from, animal, fibers, keratin, it, is, impervious, to, clothes, moths, and, carpet, beetles, linen, is, relatively, easy, to, take, care, of, since, it, resists, dirt, and, stains, has, no, lint, or, pilling, tendency, and, can, be, dry, cleaned, machine, washed, or, steamed, it, can, withstand, high, temperatures, and, has, only, moderate, initial, shrinkage, linen, should, not, be, dried, too, much, by, tumble, drying, and, it, is, much, easier, to, iron, when, damp, linen, wrinkles, very, easily, and, thus, some, more, formal, garments, require, ironing, often, in, order, to, maintain, perfect, smoothness, nevertheless, the, tendency, to, wrinkle, is, often, considered, part, of, linen, s, particular, charm, and, many, modern, linen, garments, are, designed, to, be, air, dried, on, a, good, clothes, hanger, and, worn, without, the, necessity, of, ironing, a, characteristic, often, associated, with, linen, yarn, is, the, presence, of, slubs, or, small, soft, irregular, lumps, which, occur, randomly, along, its, length, in, the, past, slubs, were, traditionally, considered, to, be, defects, and, were, associated, with, low, quality, linen, however, in, the, case, of, many, present, day, linen, fabrics, particularly, in, the, decorative, furnishing, industry, slubs, are, considered, as, part, of, the, aesthetic, appeal, of, an, expensive, natural, product, in, addition, slubs, do, not, compromise, the, integrity, of, the, fabric, and, therefore, they, are, not, viewed, as, a, defect, however, the, very, finest, linen, has, very, consistent, diameter, threads, with, no, slubs, at, all, linen, can, degrade, in, a, few, weeks, when, buried, in, soil, linen, is, more, biodegradable, than, cotton, making, it, an, eco, friendly, fiber, the, standard, measure, of, bulk, linen, yarn, is, the, lea, which, is, the, number, of, yards, in, a, pound, of, linen, divided, by, 300, for, example, a, yarn, having, a, size, of, 1, lea, will, give, 300, yards, per, pound, the, fine, yarns, used, in, handkerchiefs, etc, might, be, 40, lea, and, give, 40x300, 12, 000, yards, per, pound, this, is, a, specific, length, therefore, an, indirect, measurement, of, the, fineness, of, the, linen, i, e, the, number, of, length, units, per, unit, mass, the, symbol, is, nel, the, metric, unit, nm, is, more, commonly, used, in, continental, europe, this, is, the, number, of, 1, 000, m, lengths, per, kilogram, in, china, the, english, cotton, system, unit, nec, is, common, this, is, the, number, of, 840, yard, lengths, in, a, pound, linen, is, laborious, to, manufacture, the, quality, of, the, finished, linen, product, is, often, dependent, upon, growing, conditions, and, harvesting, techniques, to, generate, the, longest, possible, fibers, flax, is, either, hand, harvested, by, pulling, up, the, entire, plant, or, stalks, are, cut, very, close, to, the, root, after, harvesting, the, plants, are, dried, and, then, the, seeds, are, removed, through, a, mechanized, process, called, rippling, threshing, and, winnowing, the, fibers, must, then, be, loosened, from, the, stalk, this, is, achieved, through, retting, a, process, which, uses, bacteria, to, decompose, the, pectin, that, binds, the, fibers, together, natural, retting, methods, take, place, in, tanks, and, pools, or, directly, in, the, fields, there, are, also, chemical, retting, methods, these, are, faster, but, are, typically, more, harmful, to, the, environment, and, to, the, fibers, themselves, after, retting, the, stalks, are, ready, for, scutching, which, takes, place, between, august, and, december, scutching, removes, the, woody, portion, of, the, stalks, by, crushing, them, between, two, metal, rollers, so, that, the, parts, of, the, stalk, can, be, separated, the, fibers, are, removed, and, the, other, parts, such, as, linseed, shives, and, tow, are, set, aside, for, other, uses, next, the, fibers, are, heckled, the, short, fibers, are, separated, with, heckling, combs, by, combing, them, away, to, leave, behind, only, the, long, soft, flax, fibers, after, the, fibers, have, been, separated, and, processed, they, are, typically, spun, into, yarns, and, woven, or, knit, into, linen, textiles, these, textiles, can, then, be, bleached, dyed, printed, on, or, finished, with, a, number, of, treatments, or, coatings, an, alternate, production, method, is, known, as, cottonizing, which, is, quicker, and, requires, less, equipment, the, flax, stalks, are, processed, using, traditional, cotton, machinery, however, the, finished, fibers, often, lose, the, characteristic, linen, look, in, 2018, according, to, the, united, nations, repository, of, official, international, trade, statistics, china, was, the, top, exporter, of, woven, linen, fabrics, by, trade, value, with, a, reported, 732, 3, million, in, exports, italy, 173, 0, million, belgium, 68, 9, million, and, the, united, kingdom, 51, 7, million, were, also, major, exporters
