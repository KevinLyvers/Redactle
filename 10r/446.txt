a, smartphone, often, simply, called, a, phone, is, a, mobile, device, that, combines, the, functionality, of, a, traditional, mobile, phone, with, advanced, computing, capabilities, it, typically, has, a, touchscreen, interface, allowing, users, to, access, a, wide, range, of, applications, and, services, such, as, web, browsing, email, and, social, media, as, well, as, multimedia, playback, and, streaming, smartphones, have, built, in, cameras, gps, navigation, and, support, for, various, communication, methods, including, voice, calls, text, messaging, and, internet, based, messaging, apps, smartphones, are, distinguished, from, older, design, feature, phones, by, their, more, advanced, hardware, capabilities, and, extensive, mobile, operating, systems, access, to, the, internet, business, applications, mobile, payments, and, multimedia, functionality, including, music, video, gaming, radio, and, television, smartphones, typically, contain, a, number, of, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, integrated, circuit, ic, chips, include, various, sensors, that, can, be, leveraged, by, pre, installed, and, third, party, software, such, as, a, magnetometer, a, proximity, sensor, a, barometer, a, gyroscope, an, accelerometer, and, more, and, support, diverse, wireless, communication, protocols, such, as, lte, 5g, nr, wi, fi, bluetooth, and, satellite, navigation, in, the, mid, 2020s, smartphone, manufacturers, have, begun, to, integrate, satellite, messaging, connectivity, and, satellite, emergency, services, into, devices, for, use, in, remote, regions, where, there, is, no, reliable, cellular, network, following, the, rising, popularity, of, the, iphone, in, the, late, 2000s, the, majority, of, smartphones, have, featured, thin, slate, like, form, factors, with, large, capacitive, touch, screens, with, support, for, multi, touch, gestures, rather, than, physical, keyboards, most, modern, smartphones, have, the, ability, for, users, to, download, or, purchase, additional, applications, from, a, centralized, app, store, they, often, have, support, for, cloud, storage, and, cloud, synchronization, and, virtual, assistants, smartphones, have, largely, replaced, personal, digital, assistant, pda, devices, handheld, palm, sized, pcs, portable, media, players, pmp, point, and, shoot, cameras, camcorders, and, to, a, lesser, extent, handheld, video, game, consoles, e, reader, devices, pocket, calculators, and, gps, tracking, units, since, the, early, 2010s, improved, hardware, and, faster, wireless, communication, due, to, standards, such, as, lte, and, 5g, nr, have, bolstered, the, growth, of, the, smartphone, industry, as, of, 2014, over, a, billion, smartphones, are, sold, globally, every, year, in, 2019, alone, 1, 54, billion, smartphone, units, were, shipped, worldwide, 75, 05, percent, of, the, world, population, were, smartphone, users, as, of, 2020, early, smartphones, were, marketed, primarily, towards, the, enterprise, market, attempting, to, bridge, the, functionality, of, standalone, pda, devices, with, support, for, cellular, telephony, but, were, limited, by, their, bulky, form, short, battery, life, slow, analog, cellular, networks, and, the, immaturity, of, wireless, data, services, these, issues, were, eventually, resolved, with, the, exponential, scaling, and, miniaturization, of, mos, transistors, down, to, sub, micron, levels, moore, s, law, the, improved, lithium, ion, battery, faster, digital, mobile, data, networks, edholm, s, law, and, more, mature, software, platforms, that, allowed, mobile, device, ecosystems, to, develop, independently, of, data, providers, in, the, 2000s, ntt, docomo, s, i, mode, platform, blackberry, nokia, s, symbian, platform, and, windows, mobile, began, to, gain, market, traction, with, models, often, featuring, qwerty, keyboards, or, resistive, touchscreen, input, and, emphasizing, access, to, push, email, and, wireless, internet, in, the, early, 1990s, ibm, engineer, frank, canova, realised, that, chip, and, wireless, technology, was, becoming, small, enough, to, use, in, handheld, devices, the, first, commercially, available, device, that, could, be, properly, referred, to, as, a, smartphone, began, as, a, prototype, called, angler, developed, by, canova, in, 1992, while, at, ibm, and, demonstrated, in, november, of, that, year, at, the, comdex, computer, industry, trade, show, a, refined, version, was, marketed, to, consumers, in, 1994, by, bellsouth, under, the, name, simon, personal, communicator, in, addition, to, placing, and, receiving, cellular, calls, the, touchscreen, equipped, simon, could, send, and, receive, faxes, and, emails, it, included, an, address, book, calendar, appointment, scheduler, calculator, world, time, clock, and, notepad, as, well, as, other, visionary, mobile, applications, such, as, maps, stock, reports, and, news, the, ibm, simon, was, manufactured, by, mitsubishi, electric, which, integrated, features, with, its, own, cellular, radio, technologies, it, featured, a, liquid, crystal, display, lcd, and, pc, card, support, the, simon, was, commercially, unsuccessful, particularly, due, to, its, bulky, form, factor, and, limited, battery, life, using, nicad, batteries, rather, than, the, nickel, metal, hydride, batteries, commonly, used, in, mobile, phones, in, the, 1990s, or, lithium, ion, batteries, used, in, modern, smartphones, the, term, smart, phone, in, two, words, was, not, coined, until, a, year, after, the, introduction, of, the, simon, appearing, in, print, as, early, as, 1995, describing, at, t, s, phonewriter, communicator, the, term, smartphone, as, one, word, was, first, used, by, ericsson, in, 1997, to, describe, a, new, device, concept, the, gs88, beginning, in, the, mid, to, late, 1990s, many, people, who, had, mobile, phones, carried, a, separate, dedicated, pda, device, running, early, versions, of, operating, systems, such, as, palm, os, newton, os, symbian, or, windows, ce, pocket, pc, these, operating, systems, would, later, evolve, into, early, mobile, operating, systems, most, of, the, smartphones, in, this, era, were, hybrid, devices, that, combined, these, existing, familiar, pda, oses, with, basic, phone, hardware, the, results, were, devices, that, were, bulkier, than, either, dedicated, mobile, phones, or, pdas, but, allowed, a, limited, amount, of, cellular, internet, access, pda, and, mobile, phone, manufacturers, competed, in, reducing, the, size, of, devices, the, bulk, of, these, smartphones, combined, with, their, high, cost, and, expensive, data, plans, plus, other, drawbacks, such, as, expansion, limitations, and, decreased, battery, life, compared, to, separate, standalone, devices, generally, limited, their, popularity, to, early, adopters, and, business, users, who, needed, portable, connectivity, in, march, 1996, hewlett, packard, released, the, omnigo, 700lx, a, modified, hp, 200lx, palmtop, pc, with, a, nokia, 2110, mobile, phone, piggybacked, onto, it, and, rom, based, software, to, support, it, it, had, a, 640, 200, resolution, cga, compatible, four, shade, gray, scale, lcd, screen, and, could, be, used, to, place, and, receive, calls, and, to, create, and, receive, text, messages, emails, and, faxes, it, was, also, 100, dos, 5, 0, compatible, allowing, it, to, run, thousands, of, existing, software, titles, including, early, versions, of, windows, in, august, 1996, nokia, released, the, nokia, 9000, communicator, a, digital, cellular, pda, based, on, the, nokia, 2110, with, an, integrated, system, based, on, the, pen, geos, 3, 0, operating, system, from, geoworks, the, two, components, were, attached, by, a, hinge, in, what, became, known, as, a, clamshell, design, with, the, display, above, and, a, physical, qwerty, keyboard, below, the, pda, provided, e, mail, calendar, address, book, calculator, and, notebook, applications, text, based, web, browsing, and, could, send, and, receive, faxes, when, closed, the, device, could, be, used, as, a, digital, cellular, telephone, in, june, 1999, qualcomm, released, the, pdq, smartphone, a, cdma, digital, pcs, smartphone, with, an, integrated, palm, pda, and, internet, connectivity, subsequent, landmark, devices, included, in, 1999, japanese, wireless, provider, ntt, docomo, launched, i, mode, a, new, mobile, internet, platform, which, provided, data, transmission, speeds, up, to, 9, 6, kilobits, per, second, and, access, web, services, available, through, the, platform, such, as, online, shopping, ntt, docomo, s, i, mode, used, chtml, a, language, which, restricted, some, aspects, of, traditional, html, in, favor, of, increasing, data, speed, for, the, devices, limited, functionality, small, screens, and, limited, bandwidth, allowed, for, phones, to, use, the, slower, data, speeds, available, the, rise, of, i, mode, helped, ntt, docomo, accumulate, an, estimated, 40, million, subscribers, by, the, end, of, 2001, and, ranked, first, in, market, capitalization, in, japan, and, second, globally, japanese, cell, phones, increasingly, diverged, from, global, standards, and, trends, to, offer, other, forms, of, advanced, services, and, smartphone, like, functionality, that, were, specifically, tailored, to, the, japanese, market, such, as, mobile, payments, and, shopping, near, field, communication, nfc, allowing, mobile, wallet, functionality, to, replace, smart, cards, for, transit, fares, loyalty, cards, identity, cards, event, tickets, coupons, money, transfer, etc, downloadable, content, like, musical, ringtones, games, and, comics, and, 1seg, mobile, television, phones, built, by, japanese, manufacturers, used, custom, firmware, however, and, did, not, yet, feature, standardized, mobile, operating, systems, designed, to, cater, to, third, party, application, development, so, their, software, and, ecosystems, were, akin, to, very, advanced, feature, phones, as, with, other, feature, phones, additional, software, and, services, required, partnerships, and, deals, with, providers, the, degree, of, integration, between, phones, and, carriers, unique, phone, features, non, standardized, platforms, and, tailoring, to, japanese, culture, made, it, difficult, for, japanese, manufacturers, to, export, their, phones, especially, when, demand, was, so, high, in, japan, that, the, companies, did, not, feel, the, need, to, look, elsewhere, for, additional, profits, the, rise, of, 3g, technology, in, other, markets, and, non, japanese, phones, with, powerful, standardized, smartphone, operating, systems, app, stores, and, advanced, wireless, network, capabilities, allowed, non, japanese, phone, manufacturers, to, finally, break, in, to, the, japanese, market, gradually, adopting, japanese, phone, features, like, emojis, mobile, payments, nfc, etc, and, spreading, them, to, the, rest, of, the, world, phones, that, made, effective, use, of, any, significant, data, connectivity, were, still, rare, outside, japan, until, the, introduction, of, the, danger, hiptop, in, 2002, which, saw, moderate, success, among, u, s, consumers, as, the, t, mobile, sidekick, later, in, the, mid, 2000s, business, users, in, the, u, s, started, to, adopt, devices, based, on, microsoft, s, windows, mobile, and, then, blackberry, smartphones, from, research, in, motion, american, users, popularized, the, term, crackberry, in, 2006, due, to, the, blackberry, s, addictive, nature, in, the, u, s, the, high, cost, of, data, plans, and, relative, rarity, of, devices, with, wi, fi, capabilities, that, could, avoid, cellular, data, network, usage, kept, adoption, of, smartphones, mainly, to, business, professionals, and, early, adopters, outside, the, u, s, and, japan, nokia, was, seeing, success, with, its, smartphones, based, on, symbian, originally, developed, by, psion, for, their, personal, organisers, and, it, was, the, most, popular, smartphone, os, in, europe, during, the, middle, to, late, 2000s, initially, nokia, s, symbian, smartphones, were, focused, on, business, with, the, eseries, similar, to, windows, mobile, and, blackberry, devices, at, the, time, from, 2002, onwards, nokia, started, producing, consumer, focused, smartphones, popularized, by, the, entertainment, focused, nseries, until, 2010, symbian, was, the, world, s, most, widely, used, smartphone, operating, system, the, touchscreen, personal, digital, assistant, pda, derived, nature, of, adapted, operating, systems, like, palm, os, the, pocket, pc, versions, of, what, was, later, windows, mobile, and, the, uiq, interface, that, was, originally, designed, for, pen, based, pdas, on, symbian, os, devices, resulted, in, some, early, smartphones, having, stylus, based, interfaces, these, allowed, for, virtual, keyboards, and, handwriting, input, thus, also, allowing, easy, entry, of, asian, characters, by, the, mid, 2000s, the, majority, of, smartphones, had, a, physical, qwerty, keyboard, most, used, a, keyboard, bar, form, factor, like, the, blackberry, line, windows, mobile, smartphones, palm, treos, and, some, of, the, nokia, eseries, a, few, hid, their, full, physical, qwerty, keyboard, in, a, sliding, form, factor, like, the, danger, hiptop, line, some, even, had, only, a, numeric, keypad, using, t9, text, input, like, the, nokia, nseries, and, other, models, in, the, nokia, eseries, resistive, touchscreens, with, stylus, based, interfaces, could, still, be, found, on, a, few, smartphones, like, the, palm, treos, which, had, dropped, their, handwriting, input, after, a, few, early, models, that, were, available, in, versions, with, graffiti, instead, of, a, keyboard, the, late, 2000s, and, early, 2010s, saw, a, shift, in, smartphone, interfaces, away, from, devices, with, physical, keyboards, and, keypads, to, ones, with, large, finger, operated, capacitive, touchscreens, the, first, phone, of, any, kind, with, a, large, capacitive, touchscreen, was, the, lg, prada, announced, by, lg, in, december, 2006, this, was, a, fashionable, feature, phone, created, in, collaboration, with, italian, luxury, designer, prada, with, a, 3, 240, x, 400, pixel, screen, a, 2, megapixel, digital, camera, with, 144p, video, recording, ability, an, led, flash, and, a, miniature, mirror, for, self, portraits, in, january, 2007, apple, computer, introduced, the, iphone, it, had, a, 3, 5, capacitive, touchscreen, with, twice, the, common, resolution, of, most, smartphone, screens, at, the, time, and, introduced, multi, touch, to, phones, which, allowed, gestures, such, as, pinching, to, zoom, in, or, out, on, photos, maps, and, web, pages, the, iphone, was, notable, as, being, the, first, device, of, its, kind, targeted, at, the, mass, market, to, abandon, the, use, of, a, stylus, keyboard, or, keypad, typical, of, contemporary, smartphones, instead, using, a, large, touchscreen, for, direct, finger, input, as, its, main, means, of, interaction, the, iphone, s, operating, system, was, also, a, shift, away, from, older, operating, systems, which, older, phones, supported, and, which, were, adapted, from, pdas, and, feature, phones, to, an, operative, system, powerful, enough, to, not, require, using, a, limited, stripped, down, web, browser, that, can, only, render, pages, specially, formatted, using, technologies, such, as, wml, chtml, or, xhtml, and, instead, ran, a, version, of, apple, s, safari, browser, that, could, render, full, websites, not, specifically, designed, for, mobile, phones, later, apple, shipped, a, software, update, that, gave, the, iphone, a, built, in, on, device, app, store, allowing, direct, wireless, downloads, of, third, party, software, this, kind, of, centralized, app, store, and, free, developer, tools, quickly, became, the, new, main, paradigm, for, all, smartphone, platforms, for, software, development, distribution, discovery, installation, and, payment, in, place, of, expensive, developer, tools, that, required, official, approval, to, use, and, a, dependence, on, third, party, sources, providing, applications, for, multiple, platforms, the, advantages, of, a, design, with, software, powerful, enough, to, support, advanced, applications, and, a, large, capacitive, touchscreen, affected, the, development, of, another, smartphone, os, platform, android, with, a, more, blackberry, like, prototype, device, scrapped, in, favor, of, a, touchscreen, device, with, a, slide, out, physical, keyboard, as, google, s, engineers, thought, at, the, time, that, a, touchscreen, could, not, completely, replace, a, physical, keyboard, and, buttons, android, is, based, around, a, modified, linux, kernel, again, providing, more, power, than, mobile, operating, systems, adapted, from, pdas, and, feature, phones, the, first, android, device, the, horizontal, sliding, htc, dream, was, released, in, september, 2008, in, 2012, asus, started, experimenting, with, a, convertible, docking, system, named, padfone, where, the, standalone, handset, can, when, necessary, be, inserted, into, a, tablet, sized, screen, unit, with, integrated, supportive, battery, and, used, as, such, in, 2013, and, 2014, samsung, experimented, with, the, hybrid, combination, of, compact, camera, and, smartphone, releasing, the, galaxy, s4, zoom, and, k, zoom, each, equipped, with, integrated, 10, optical, zoom, lens, and, manual, parameter, settings, including, manual, exposure, and, focus, years, before, these, were, widely, adapted, among, smartphones, the, s4, zoom, additionally, has, a, rotary, knob, ring, around, the, lens, and, a, tripod, mount, while, screen, sizes, have, increased, manufacturers, have, attempted, to, make, smartphones, thinner, at, the, expense, of, utility, and, sturdiness, since, a, thinner, frame, is, more, vulnerable, to, bending, and, has, less, space, for, components, namely, battery, capacity, the, iphone, and, later, touchscreen, only, android, devices, together, popularized, the, slate, form, factor, based, on, a, large, capacitive, touchscreen, as, the, sole, means, of, interaction, and, led, to, the, decline, of, earlier, keyboard, and, keypad, focused, platforms, later, navigation, keys, such, as, the, home, back, menu, task, and, search, buttons, have, also, been, increasingly, replaced, by, nonphysical, touch, keys, then, virtual, simulated, on, screen, navigation, keys, commonly, with, access, combinations, such, as, a, long, press, of, the, task, key, to, simulate, a, short, menu, key, press, as, with, home, button, to, search, more, recent, bezel, less, types, have, their, screen, surface, space, extended, to, the, unit, s, front, bottom, to, compensate, for, the, display, area, lost, for, simulating, the, navigation, keys, while, virtual, keys, offer, more, potential, customizability, their, location, may, be, inconsistent, among, systems, depending, on, screen, rotation, and, software, used, multiple, vendors, attempted, to, update, or, replace, their, existing, smartphone, platforms, and, devices, to, better, compete, with, android, and, the, iphone, palm, unveiled, a, new, platform, known, as, webos, for, its, palm, pre, in, late, 2009, to, replace, palm, os, which, featured, a, focus, on, a, task, based, card, metaphor, and, seamless, synchronization, and, integration, between, various, online, services, as, opposed, to, the, then, conventional, concept, of, a, smartphone, needing, a, pc, to, serve, as, a, canonical, authoritative, repository, for, user, data, hp, acquired, palm, in, 2010, and, released, several, other, webos, devices, including, the, pre, 3, and, hp, touchpad, tablet, as, part, of, a, proposed, divestment, of, its, consumer, business, to, focus, on, enterprise, software, hp, abruptly, ended, development, of, future, webos, devices, in, august, 2011, and, sold, the, rights, to, webos, to, lg, electronics, in, 2013, for, use, as, a, smart, tv, platform, research, in, motion, introduced, the, vertical, sliding, blackberry, torch, and, blackberry, os, 6, in, 2010, which, featured, a, redesigned, user, interface, support, for, gestures, such, as, pinch, to, zoom, and, a, new, web, browser, based, on, the, same, webkit, rendering, engine, used, by, the, iphone, the, following, year, rim, released, blackberry, os, 7, and, new, models, in, the, bold, and, torch, ranges, which, included, a, new, bold, with, a, touchscreen, alongside, its, keyboard, and, the, torch, 9860, the, first, blackberry, phone, to, not, include, a, physical, keyboard, in, 2013, it, replaced, the, legacy, blackberry, os, with, a, revamped, qnx, based, platform, known, as, blackberry, 10, with, the, all, touch, blackberry, z10, and, keyboard, equipped, q10, as, launch, devices, in, 2010, microsoft, unveiled, a, replacement, for, windows, mobile, known, as, windows, phone, featuring, a, new, touchscreen, centric, user, interface, built, around, flat, design, and, typography, a, home, screen, with, live, tiles, containing, feeds, of, updates, from, apps, as, well, as, integrated, microsoft, office, apps, in, february, 2011, nokia, announced, that, it, had, entered, into, a, major, partnership, with, microsoft, under, which, it, would, exclusively, use, windows, phone, on, all, of, its, future, smartphones, and, integrate, microsoft, s, bing, search, engine, and, bing, maps, which, as, part, of, the, partnership, would, also, license, nokia, maps, data, into, all, future, devices, the, announcement, led, to, the, abandonment, of, both, symbian, as, well, as, meego, a, linux, based, mobile, platform, it, was, co, developing, with, intel, nokia, s, low, end, lumia, 520, saw, strong, demand, and, helped, windows, phone, gain, niche, popularity, in, some, markets, overtaking, blackberry, in, global, market, share, in, 2013, in, mid, june, 2012, meizu, released, its, mobile, operating, system, flyme, os, many, of, these, attempts, to, compete, with, android, and, iphone, were, short, lived, over, the, course, of, the, decade, the, two, platforms, became, a, clear, duopoly, in, smartphone, sales, and, market, share, with, blackberry, windows, phone, and, other, operating, systems, eventually, stagnating, to, little, or, no, measurable, market, share, in, 2015, blackberry, began, to, pivot, away, from, its, in, house, mobile, platforms, in, favor, of, producing, android, devices, focusing, on, a, security, enhanced, distribution, of, the, software, the, following, year, the, company, announced, that, it, would, also, exit, the, hardware, market, to, focus, more, on, software, and, its, enterprise, middleware, and, began, to, license, the, blackberry, brand, and, its, android, distribution, to, third, party, oems, such, as, tcl, for, future, devices, in, september, 2013, microsoft, announced, its, intent, to, acquire, nokia, s, mobile, device, business, for, 7, 1, billion, as, part, of, a, strategy, under, ceo, steve, ballmer, for, microsoft, to, be, a, devices, and, services, company, despite, the, growth, of, windows, phone, and, the, lumia, range, which, accounted, for, nearly, 90, of, all, windows, phone, devices, sold, the, platform, never, had, significant, market, share, in, the, key, u, s, market, and, microsoft, was, unable, to, maintain, windows, phone, s, momentum, in, the, years, that, followed, resulting, in, dwindling, interest, from, users, and, app, developers, after, balmer, was, succeeded, by, satya, nadella, who, has, placed, a, larger, focus, on, software, and, cloud, computing, as, ceo, of, microsoft, it, took, a, 7, 6, billion, write, off, on, the, nokia, assets, in, july, 2015, and, laid, off, nearly, the, entire, microsoft, mobile, unit, in, may, 2016, prior, to, the, completion, of, the, sale, to, microsoft, nokia, released, a, series, of, android, derived, smartphones, for, emerging, markets, known, as, nokia, x, which, combined, an, android, based, platform, with, elements, of, windows, phone, and, nokia, s, feature, phone, platform, asha, using, microsoft, and, nokia, services, rather, than, google, the, first, commercial, camera, phone, was, the, kyocera, visual, phone, vp, 210, released, in, japan, in, may, 1999, it, was, called, a, mobile, videophone, at, the, time, and, had, a, 110, 000, pixel, front, facing, camera, it, could, send, up, to, two, images, per, second, over, japan, s, personal, handy, phone, system, phs, cellular, network, and, store, up, to, 20, jpeg, digital, images, which, could, be, sent, over, e, mail, the, first, mass, market, camera, phone, was, the, j, sh04, a, sharp, j, phone, model, sold, in, japan, in, november, 2000, it, could, instantly, transmit, pictures, via, cell, phone, telecommunication, by, the, mid, 2000s, higher, end, cell, phones, commonly, had, integrated, digital, cameras, in, 2003, camera, phones, outsold, stand, alone, digital, cameras, and, in, 2006, they, outsold, film, and, digital, stand, alone, cameras, five, billion, camera, phones, were, sold, in, five, years, and, by, 2007, more, than, half, of, the, installed, base, of, all, mobile, phones, were, camera, phones, sales, of, separate, cameras, peaked, in, 2008, many, early, smartphones, did, not, have, cameras, at, all, and, earlier, models, that, had, them, had, low, performance, and, insufficient, image, and, video, quality, that, could, not, compete, with, budget, pocket, cameras, and, fulfill, user, s, needs, by, the, beginning, of, the, 2010s, almost, all, smartphones, had, an, integrated, digital, camera, the, decline, in, sales, of, stand, alone, cameras, accelerated, due, to, the, increasing, use, of, smartphones, with, rapidly, improving, camera, technology, for, casual, photography, easier, image, manipulation, and, abilities, to, directly, share, photos, through, the, use, of, apps, and, web, based, services, by, 2011, cell, phones, with, integrated, cameras, were, selling, hundreds, of, millions, per, year, in, 2015, digital, camera, sales, were, 35, 395, million, units, or, only, less, than, a, third, of, digital, camera, sales, numbers, at, their, peak, and, also, slightly, less, than, film, camera, sold, number, at, their, peak, contributing, to, the, rise, in, popularity, of, smartphones, being, used, over, dedicated, cameras, for, photography, smaller, pocket, cameras, have, difficulty, producing, bokeh, in, images, but, nowadays, some, smartphones, have, dual, lens, cameras, that, reproduce, the, bokeh, effect, easily, and, can, even, rearrange, the, level, of, bokeh, after, shooting, this, works, by, capturing, multiple, images, with, different, focus, settings, then, combining, the, background, of, the, main, image, with, a, macro, focus, shot, in, 2007, the, nokia, n95, was, notable, as, a, smartphone, that, had, a, 5, 0, megapixel, mp, camera, when, most, others, had, cameras, with, around, 3, mp, or, less, than, 2, mp, some, specialized, feature, phones, like, the, lg, viewty, samsung, sgh, g800, and, sony, ericsson, k850i, all, released, later, that, year, also, had, 5, 0, mp, cameras, by, 2010, 5, 0, mp, cameras, were, common, a, few, smartphones, had, 8, 0, mp, cameras, and, the, nokia, n8, sony, ericsson, satio, and, samsung, m8910, pixon12, feature, phone, had, 12, mp, the, main, camera, of, the, 2009, nokia, n86, uniquely, features, a, three, level, aperture, lens, the, altek, leo, a, 14, megapixel, smartphone, with, 3x, optical, zoom, lens, and, 720p, hd, video, camera, was, released, in, late, 2010, in, 2011, the, same, year, the, nintendo, 3ds, was, released, htc, unveiled, the, evo, 3d, a, 3d, phone, with, a, dual, five, megapixel, rear, camera, setup, for, spatial, imaging, among, the, earliest, mobile, phones, with, more, than, one, rear, camera, the, 2012, samsung, galaxy, s3, introduced, the, ability, to, capture, photos, using, voice, commands, in, 2012, nokia, announced, and, released, the, nokia, 808, pureview, featuring, a, 41, megapixel, 1, 1, 2, inch, sensor, and, a, high, resolution, f, 2, 4, zeiss, all, aspherical, one, group, lens, the, high, resolution, enables, four, times, of, lossless, digital, zoom, at, 1080p, and, six, times, at, 720p, resolution, using, image, sensor, cropping, the, 2013, nokia, lumia, 1020, has, a, similar, high, resolution, camera, setup, with, the, addition, of, optical, image, stabilization, and, manual, camera, settings, years, before, common, among, high, end, mobile, phones, although, lacking, expandable, storage, that, could, be, of, use, for, accordingly, high, file, sizes, mobile, optical, image, stabilization, was, first, introduced, by, nokia, in, 2012, with, the, lumia, 920, and, the, earliest, known, smartphone, with, an, optically, stabilized, front, camera, is, the, htc, 10, from, 2016, optical, image, stabilization, enables, prolonged, exposure, times, for, low, light, photography, and, smoothing, out, handheld, video, shaking, since, the, appearance, of, shakes, magnifies, over, a, larger, display, such, as, a, monitor, or, television, set, which, would, be, detrimental, to, the, watching, experience, since, 2012, smartphones, have, become, increasingly, able, to, capture, photos, while, filming, the, resolution, of, those, photos, resolution, may, vary, between, devices, samsung, has, used, the, highest, image, sensor, resolution, at, the, video, s, aspect, ratio, which, at, 16, 9, is, 6, megapixels, 3264, 1836, on, the, galaxy, s3, and, 9, 6, megapixels, 4128, 2322, on, the, galaxy, s4, the, earliest, iphones, with, such, functionality, iphone, 5, and, 5s, captured, simultaneous, photos, at, 0, 9, megapixels, 1280, 720, while, filming, starting, in, 2013, on, the, xperia, z1, sony, experimented, with, real, time, augmented, reality, camera, effects, such, as, floating, text, virtual, plants, volcano, and, a, dinosaur, walking, in, the, scenery, apple, later, did, similarly, in, 2017, with, the, iphone, x, in, the, same, year, ios, 7, introduced, the, later, widely, implemented, viewfinder, intuition, where, exposure, value, can, be, adjusted, through, vertical, swiping, after, focus, and, exposure, has, been, set, by, tapping, and, even, while, locked, after, holding, down, for, a, brief, moment, on, some, devices, this, intuition, may, be, restricted, by, software, in, video, slow, motion, modes, and, for, front, camera, in, 2013, samsung, unveiled, the, galaxy, s4, zoom, smartphone, with, the, grip, shape, of, a, compact, camera, and, a, 10, optical, zoom, lens, as, well, as, a, rotary, knob, ring, around, the, lens, as, used, on, higher, end, compact, cameras, and, an, iso, 1222, tripod, mount, it, is, equipped, with, manual, parameter, settings, including, for, focus, and, exposure, the, successor, 2014, samsung, galaxy, k, zoom, brought, resolution, and, performance, enhancements, but, lacks, the, rotary, knob, and, tripod, mount, to, allow, for, a, more, smartphone, like, shape, with, less, protruding, lens, the, 2014, panasonic, lumix, dmc, cm1, was, another, attempt, at, mixing, mobile, phone, with, compact, camera, so, much, so, that, it, inherited, the, lumix, brand, while, lacking, optical, zoom, its, image, sensor, has, a, format, of, 1, as, used, in, high, end, compact, cameras, such, as, the, lumix, dmc, lx100, and, sony, cybershot, dsc, rx100, series, with, multiple, times, the, surface, size, of, a, typical, mobile, camera, image, sensor, as, well, as, support, for, light, sensitivities, of, up, to, iso, 25600, well, beyond, the, typical, mobile, camera, light, sensitivity, range, as, of, 2021, no, successor, has, been, released, in, 2013, and, 2014, htc, experimentally, traded, in, pixel, count, for, pixel, surface, size, on, their, one, m7, and, m8, both, with, only, four, megapixels, marketed, as, ultrapixel, citing, improved, brightness, and, less, noise, in, low, light, though, the, more, recent, one, m8, lacks, optical, image, stabilization, the, one, m8, additionally, was, one, of, the, earliest, smartphones, to, be, equipped, with, a, dual, camera, setup, its, software, allows, generating, visual, spatial, effects, such, as, 3d, panning, weather, effects, and, focus, adjustment, ufocus, simulating, the, postphotographic, selective, focusing, capability, of, images, produced, by, a, light, field, camera, htc, returned, to, a, high, megapixel, single, camera, setup, on, the, 2015, one, m9, meanwhile, in, 2014, lg, mobile, started, experimenting, with, time, of, flight, camera, functionality, where, a, rear, laser, beam, that, measures, distance, accelerates, autofocus, phase, detection, autofocus, was, increasingly, adapted, throughout, the, mid, 2010s, allowing, for, quicker, and, more, accurate, focusing, than, contrast, detection, in, 2016, apple, introduced, the, iphone, 7, plus, one, of, the, phones, to, popularize, a, dual, camera, setup, the, iphone, 7, plus, included, a, main, 12, mp, camera, along, with, a, 12, mp, telephoto, camera, in, early, 2018, huawei, released, a, new, flagship, phone, the, huawei, p20, pro, one, of, the, first, triple, camera, lens, setups, with, leica, optics, in, late, 2018, samsung, released, a, new, mid, range, smartphone, the, galaxy, a9, 2018, with, the, world, s, first, quad, camera, setup, the, nokia, 9, pureview, was, released, in, 2019, featuring, a, penta, lens, camera, system, 2019, saw, the, commercialization, of, high, resolution, sensors, which, use, pixel, binning, to, capture, more, light, 48, mp, and, 64, mp, sensors, developed, by, sony, and, samsung, are, commonly, used, by, several, manufacturers, 108, mp, sensors, were, first, implemented, in, late, 2019, and, early, 2020, with, stronger, getting, chipsets, to, handle, computing, workload, demands, at, higher, pixel, rates, mobile, video, resolution, and, framerate, has, caught, up, with, dedicated, consumer, grade, cameras, over, years, in, 2009, the, samsung, omnia, hd, became, the, first, mobile, phone, with, 720p, hd, video, recording, in, the, same, year, apple, brought, video, recording, initially, to, the, iphone, 3gs, at, 480p, whereas, the, 2007, original, iphone, and, 2008, iphone, 3g, lacked, video, recording, entirely, 720p, was, more, widely, adapted, in, 2010, on, smartphones, such, as, the, original, samsung, galaxy, s, sony, ericsson, xperia, x10, iphone, 4, and, htc, desire, hd, the, early, 2010s, brought, a, steep, increase, in, mobile, video, resolution, 1080p, mobile, video, recording, was, achieved, in, 2011, on, the, samsung, galaxy, s2, htc, sensation, and, iphone, 4s, in, 2012, and, 2013, select, devices, with, 720p, filming, at, 60, frames, per, second, were, released, the, asus, padfone, 2, and, htc, one, m7, unlike, flagships, of, samsung, sony, and, apple, however, the, 2013, samsung, galaxy, s4, zoom, does, support, it, in, 2013, the, samsung, galaxy, note, 3, introduced, 2160p, 4k, video, recording, at, 30, frames, per, second, as, well, as, 1080p, doubled, to, 60, frames, per, second, for, smoothness, other, vendors, adapted, 2160p, recording, in, 2014, including, the, optically, stabilized, lg, g3, apple, first, implemented, it, in, late, 2015, on, the, iphone, 6s, and, 6s, plus, the, framerate, at, 2160p, was, widely, doubled, to, 60, in, 2017, and, 2018, starting, with, the, iphone, 8, galaxy, s9, lg, g7, and, oneplus, 6, sufficient, computing, performance, of, chipsets, and, image, sensor, resolution, and, its, reading, speeds, have, enabled, mobile, 4320p, 8k, filming, in, 2020, introduced, with, the, samsung, galaxy, s20, and, redmi, k30, pro, though, some, upper, resolution, levels, were, foregone, skipped, throughout, development, including, 1440p, 2, 5k, 2880p, 5k, and, 3240p, 6k, except, 1440p, on, samsung, galaxy, front, cameras, among, mid, range, smartphone, series, the, introduction, of, higher, video, resolutions, was, initially, delayed, by, two, to, three, years, compared, to, flagship, counterparts, 720p, was, widely, adapted, in, 2012, including, with, the, samsung, galaxy, s3, mini, sony, xperia, go, and, 1080p, in, 2013, on, the, samsung, galaxy, s4, mini, and, htc, one, mini, the, proliferation, of, video, resolutions, beyond, 1080p, has, been, postponed, by, several, years, the, mid, class, sony, xperia, m5, supported, 2160p, filming, in, 2016, whereas, samsung, s, mid, class, series, such, as, the, galaxy, j, and, a, series, were, strictly, limited, to, 1080p, in, resolution, and, 30, frames, per, second, at, any, resolution, for, six, years, until, around, 2019, whether, and, how, much, for, technical, reasons, is, unclear, a, lower, video, resolution, setting, may, be, desirable, to, extend, recording, time, by, reducing, space, storage, and, power, consumption, the, camera, software, of, some, sophisticated, devices, such, as, the, lg, v10, is, equipped, with, separate, controls, for, resolution, frame, rate, and, bit, rate, within, a, technically, supported, range, of, pixel, rate, a, distinction, between, different, camera, software, is, the, method, used, to, store, high, frame, rate, video, footage, with, more, recent, phones, retaining, both, the, image, sensor, s, original, output, frame, rate, and, audio, while, earlier, phones, do, not, record, audio, and, stretch, the, video, so, it, can, be, played, back, slowly, at, default, speed, while, the, stretched, encoding, method, used, on, earlier, phones, enables, slow, motion, playback, on, video, player, software, that, lacks, manual, playback, speed, control, typically, found, on, older, devices, if, the, aim, were, to, achieve, a, slow, motion, effect, the, real, time, method, used, by, more, recent, phones, offers, greater, versatility, for, video, editing, where, slowed, down, portions, of, the, footage, can, be, freely, selected, by, the, user, and, exported, into, a, separate, video, a, rudimentary, video, editing, software, for, this, purpose, is, usually, pre, installed, the, video, can, optionally, be, played, back, at, normal, real, time, speed, acting, as, usual, video, the, earliest, smartphone, known, to, feature, a, slow, motion, mode, is, the, 2009, samsung, i8000, omnia, ii, which, can, record, at, qvga, 320, 240, at, 120, fps, frames, per, second, slow, motion, was, not, available, on, the, 2010, galaxy, s1, 2011, galaxy, s2, 2011, galaxy, note, 1, and, 2012, galaxy, s3, flagships, in, early, 2012, the, htc, one, x, allowed, 768, 432, pixel, slow, motion, filming, at, an, undocumented, frame, rate, the, output, footage, has, been, measured, as, a, third, of, real, time, speed, in, late, 2012, the, galaxy, note, 2, brought, back, slow, motion, with, d1, 720, 480, at, 120, fps, in, early, 2013, the, galaxy, s4, and, htc, one, m7, recorded, at, that, frame, rate, with, 800, 450, followed, by, the, note, 3, and, iphone, 5s, with, 720p, 1280, 720, in, late, 2013, the, latter, of, which, retaines, audio, and, original, sensor, frame, rate, as, with, all, later, iphones, in, early, 2014, the, sony, xperia, z2, and, htc, one, m8, adapted, this, resolution, as, well, in, late, 2014, the, iphone, 6, doubled, the, frame, rate, to, 240, fps, and, in, late, 2015, the, iphone, 6s, added, support, for, 1080p, 1920, 1080, at, 120, frames, per, second, in, early, 2015, the, galaxy, s6, became, the, first, samsung, mobile, phone, to, retain, the, sensor, framerate, and, audio, and, in, early, 2016, the, galaxy, s7, became, the, first, samsung, mobile, phone, with, 240, fps, recording, also, at, 720p, in, early, 2015, the, mt6795, chipset, by, mediatek, promised, 1080p, 480, fps, video, recording, the, project, s, status, remains, indefinite, since, early, 2017, starting, with, the, sony, xperia, xz, smartphones, have, been, released, with, a, slow, motion, mode, that, unsustainably, records, at, framerates, multiple, times, as, high, by, temporarily, storing, frames, on, the, image, sensor, s, internal, burst, memory, such, a, recording, endures, few, real, time, seconds, at, most, in, late, 2017, the, iphone, 8, brought, 1080p, at, 240, fps, as, well, as, 2160p, at, 60, fps, followed, by, the, galaxy, s9, in, early, 2018, in, mid, 2018, the, oneplus, 6, brought, 720p, at, 480, fps, sustainable, for, one, minute, in, early, 2021, the, oneplus, 9, pro, became, the, first, phone, with, 2160p, at, 120, fps, the, first, smartphones, to, record, hdr, video, were, the, early, 2013, sony, xperia, z, and, mid, 2013, xperia, z, ultra, followed, by, the, early, 2014, galaxy, s5, all, at, 1080p, mobile, phones, with, multiple, microphones, usually, allow, video, recording, with, stereo, audio, for, spaciality, with, samsung, sony, and, htc, initially, implementing, it, in, 2012, on, their, samsung, galaxy, s3, sony, xperia, s, and, htc, one, x, apple, implemented, stereo, audio, starting, with, the, 2018, iphone, xs, family, and, iphone, xr, emphasis, is, being, put, on, the, front, camera, since, the, mid, 2010s, where, front, cameras, have, reached, resolutions, as, high, as, typical, rear, cameras, such, as, the, 2015, lg, g4, 8, megapixels, sony, xperia, c5, ultra, 13, megapixels, and, 2016, sony, xperia, xa, ultra, 16, megapixels, optically, stabilized, the, 2015, lg, v10, brought, a, dual, front, camera, system, where, the, second, has, a, wider, angle, for, group, photography, samsung, implemented, a, front, camera, sweep, panorama, panorama, selfie, feature, since, the, galaxy, note, 4, to, extend, the, field, of, view, in, 2012, the, galaxy, s3, and, iphone, 5, brought, 720p, hd, front, video, recording, at, 30, fps, in, early, 2013, the, samsung, galaxy, s4, htc, one, m7, and, sony, xperia, z, brought, 1080p, full, hd, at, that, framerate, and, in, late, 2014, the, galaxy, note, 4, introduced, 1440p, video, recording, on, the, front, camera, apple, adapted, 1080p, front, camera, video, with, the, late, 2016, iphone, 7, in, 2019, smartphones, started, adapting, 2160p, 4k, video, recording, on, the, front, camera, six, years, after, rear, camera, 2160p, commenced, with, the, galaxy, note, 3, in, the, early, 2010s, larger, smartphones, with, screen, sizes, of, at, least, 140, millimetres, 5, 5, in, diagonal, dubbed, phablets, began, to, achieve, popularity, with, the, 2011, samsung, galaxy, note, series, gaining, notably, wide, adoption, in, 2013, huawei, launched, the, huawei, mate, series, sporting, a, 155, millimetres, 6, 1, in, hd, 1280, x, 720, ips, lcd, display, which, was, considered, to, be, quite, large, at, the, time, some, companies, began, to, release, smartphones, in, 2013, incorporating, flexible, displays, to, create, curved, form, factors, such, as, the, samsung, galaxy, round, and, lg, g, flex, by, 2014, 1440p, displays, began, to, appear, on, high, end, smartphones, in, 2015, sony, released, the, xperia, z5, premium, featuring, a, 4k, resolution, display, although, only, images, and, videos, could, actually, be, rendered, at, that, resolution, all, other, software, was, shown, at, 1080p, new, trends, for, smartphone, displays, began, to, emerge, in, 2017, with, both, lg, and, samsung, releasing, flagship, smartphones, lg, g6, and, galaxy, s8, utilizing, displays, with, taller, aspect, ratios, than, the, common, 16, 9, ratio, and, a, high, screen, to, body, ratio, also, known, as, a, bezel, less, design, these, designs, allow, the, display, to, have, a, larger, diagonal, measurement, but, with, a, slimmer, width, than, 16, 9, displays, with, an, equivalent, screen, size, another, trend, popularized, in, 2017, were, displays, containing, tab, like, cut, outs, at, the, top, centre, colloquially, known, as, a, notch, to, contain, the, front, facing, camera, and, sometimes, other, sensors, typically, located, along, the, top, bezel, of, a, device, these, designs, allow, for, edge, to, edge, displays, that, take, up, nearly, the, entire, height, of, the, device, with, little, to, no, bezel, along, the, top, and, sometimes, a, minimal, bottom, bezel, as, well, this, design, characteristic, appeared, almost, simultaneously, on, the, sharp, aquos, s2, and, the, essential, phone, which, featured, small, circular, tabs, for, their, cameras, followed, just, a, month, later, by, the, iphone, x, which, used, a, wider, tab, to, contain, a, camera, and, facial, scanning, system, known, as, face, id, the, 2016, lg, v10, had, a, precursor, to, the, concept, with, a, portion, of, the, screen, wrapped, around, the, camera, area, in, the, top, left, corner, and, the, resulting, area, marketed, as, a, second, display, that, could, be, used, for, various, supplemental, features, other, variations, of, the, practice, later, emerged, such, as, a, hole, punch, camera, such, as, those, of, the, honor, view, 20, and, samsung, s, galaxy, a8s, and, galaxy, s10, eschewing, the, tabbed, notch, for, a, circular, or, rounded, rectangular, cut, out, within, the, screen, instead, while, oppo, released, the, first, all, screen, phones, with, no, notches, at, all, including, one, with, a, mechanical, front, camera, that, pops, up, from, the, top, of, the, device, find, x, and, a, 2019, prototype, for, a, front, facing, camera, that, can, be, embedded, and, hidden, below, the, display, using, a, special, partially, translucent, screen, structure, that, allows, light, to, reach, the, image, sensor, below, the, panel, the, first, implementation, was, the, zte, axon, 20, 5g, with, a, 32, mp, sensor, manufactured, by, visionox, displays, supporting, refresh, rates, higher, than, 60, hz, such, as, 90, hz, or, 120, hz, also, began, to, appear, on, smartphones, in, 2017, initially, confined, to, gaming, smartphones, such, as, the, razer, phone, 2017, and, asus, rog, phone, 2018, they, later, became, more, common, on, flagship, phones, such, as, the, pixel, 4, 2019, and, samsung, galaxy, s21, series, 2021, higher, refresh, rates, allow, for, smoother, motion, and, lower, input, latency, but, often, at, the, cost, of, battery, life, as, such, the, device, may, offer, a, means, to, disable, high, refresh, rates, or, be, configured, to, automatically, reduce, the, refresh, rate, when, there, is, low, on, screen, motion, an, early, implementation, of, multiple, simultaneous, tasks, on, a, smartphone, display, are, the, picture, in, picture, video, playback, mode, pop, up, play, and, live, video, list, with, playing, video, thumbnails, of, the, 2012, samsung, galaxy, s3, the, former, of, which, was, later, delivered, to, the, 2011, samsung, galaxy, note, through, a, software, update, later, that, year, a, split, screen, mode, was, implemented, on, the, galaxy, note, 2, later, retrofitted, on, the, galaxy, s3, through, the, premium, suite, upgrade, the, earliest, implementation, of, desktop, and, laptop, like, windowing, was, on, the, 2013, samsung, galaxy, note, 3, smartphones, utilizing, flexible, displays, were, theorized, as, possible, once, manufacturing, costs, and, production, processes, were, feasible, in, november, 2018, the, startup, company, royole, unveiled, the, first, commercially, available, foldable, smartphone, the, royole, flexpai, also, that, month, samsung, presented, a, prototype, phone, featuring, an, infinity, flex, display, at, its, developers, conference, with, a, smaller, outer, display, on, its, cover, and, a, larger, tablet, sized, display, when, opened, samsung, stated, that, it, also, had, to, develop, a, new, polymer, material, to, coat, the, display, as, opposed, to, glass, samsung, officially, announced, the, galaxy, fold, based, on, the, previously, demonstrated, prototype, in, february, 2019, for, an, originally, scheduled, release, in, late, april, due, to, various, durability, issues, with, the, display, and, hinge, systems, encountered, by, early, reviewers, the, release, of, the, galaxy, fold, was, delayed, to, september, to, allow, for, design, changes, in, november, 2019, motorola, unveiled, a, variation, of, the, concept, with, its, re, imagining, of, the, razr, using, a, horizontally, folding, display, to, create, a, clamshell, form, factor, inspired, by, its, previous, feature, phone, range, of, the, same, name, samsung, would, unveil, a, similar, device, known, as, the, galaxy, z, flip, the, following, february, the, first, smartphone, with, a, fingerprint, reader, was, the, motorola, atrix, 4g, in, 2011, in, september, 2013, the, iphone, 5s, was, unveiled, as, the, first, smartphone, on, a, major, u, s, carrier, since, the, atrix, to, feature, this, technology, once, again, the, iphone, popularized, this, concept, one, of, the, barriers, of, fingerprint, reading, amongst, consumers, was, security, concerns, however, apple, was, able, to, address, these, concerns, by, encrypting, this, fingerprint, data, onto, the, a7, processor, located, inside, the, phone, as, well, as, make, sure, this, information, could, not, be, accessed, by, third, party, applications, and, is, not, stored, in, icloud, or, apple, servers, in, 2012, samsung, introduced, the, galaxy, s3, gt, i9300, with, retrofittable, wireless, charging, pop, up, video, playback, 4g, lte, variant, gt, i9305, quad, core, processor, in, 2013, fairphone, launched, its, first, socially, ethical, smartphone, at, the, london, design, festival, to, address, concerns, regarding, the, sourcing, of, materials, in, the, manufacturing, followed, by, shiftphone, in, 2015, in, late, 2013, qsalpha, commenced, production, of, a, smartphone, designed, entirely, around, security, encryption, and, identity, protection, in, october, 2013, motorola, mobility, announced, project, ara, a, concept, for, a, modular, smartphone, platform, that, would, allow, users, to, customize, and, upgrade, their, phones, with, add, on, modules, that, attached, magnetically, to, a, frame, ara, was, retained, by, google, following, its, sale, of, motorola, mobility, to, lenovo, but, was, shelved, in, 2016, that, year, lg, and, motorola, both, unveiled, smartphones, featuring, a, limited, form, of, modularity, for, accessories, the, lg, g5, allowed, accessories, to, be, installed, via, the, removal, of, its, battery, compartment, while, the, moto, z, utilizes, accessories, attached, magnetically, to, the, rear, of, the, device, microsoft, expanding, upon, the, concept, of, motorola, s, short, lived, webtop, unveiled, functionality, for, its, windows, 10, operating, system, for, phones, that, allows, supported, devices, to, be, docked, for, use, with, a, pc, styled, desktop, environment, samsung, and, lg, used, to, be, the, last, standing, manufacturers, to, offer, flagship, devices, with, user, replaceable, batteries, but, in, 2015, samsung, succumbed, to, the, minimalism, trend, set, by, apple, introducing, the, galaxy, s6, without, a, user, replaceable, battery, in, addition, samsung, was, criticised, for, pruning, long, standing, features, such, as, mhl, micro, usb, 3, 0, water, resistance, and, microsd, card, support, of, which, the, latter, two, came, back, in, 2016, with, the, galaxy, s7, and, s7, edge, as, of, 2015, the, global, median, for, smartphone, ownership, was, 43, statista, forecast, that, 2, 87, billion, people, would, own, smartphones, in, 2020, within, the, same, decade, rapid, deployment, of, lte, cellular, network, and, general, availability, of, smartphones, have, increased, popularity, of, the, streaming, television, services, and, the, corresponding, mobile, tv, apps, major, technologies, that, began, to, trend, in, 2016, included, a, focus, on, virtual, reality, and, augmented, reality, experiences, catered, towards, smartphones, the, newly, introduced, usb, c, connector, and, improving, lte, technologies, in, 2016, adjustable, screen, resolution, known, from, desktop, operating, systems, was, introduced, to, smartphones, for, power, saving, whereas, variable, screen, refresh, rates, were, popularized, in, 2020, in, 2018, the, first, smartphones, featuring, fingerprint, readers, embedded, within, oled, displays, were, announced, followed, in, 2019, by, an, implementation, using, an, ultrasonic, sensor, on, the, samsung, galaxy, s10, in, 2019, the, majority, of, smartphones, released, have, more, than, one, camera, are, waterproof, with, ip67, and, ip68, ratings, and, unlock, using, facial, recognition, or, fingerprint, scanners, designs, first, implemented, by, apple, have, been, replicated, by, other, vendors, several, times, these, include, a, sealed, body, that, does, not, allow, replacing, the, battery, a, lack, of, the, physical, audio, connecter, since, the, iphone, 7, from, 2016, a, screen, with, a, cut, out, area, at, the, top, for, the, earphone, and, front, facing, camera, and, sensors, colloquially, known, as, notch, since, the, iphone, x, from, 2017, the, exclusion, of, a, charging, wall, adapter, from, the, scope, of, delivery, since, the, iphone, 12, from, 2019, and, a, camera, user, interface, with, circular, and, usually, solid, colour, shutter, button, and, a, camera, mode, selector, using, perpendicular, text, and, separate, camera, modes, for, photo, and, video, since, ios, 7, from, 2013, in, 2020, the, first, smartphones, featuring, high, speed, 5g, network, capability, were, announced, since, 2020, smartphones, have, decreasingly, been, shipped, with, rudimentary, accessories, like, a, power, adapter, and, headphones, that, have, historically, been, almost, invariably, within, the, scope, of, delivery, this, trend, was, initiated, with, apple, s, iphone, 12, followed, by, samsung, and, xiaomi, on, the, galaxy, s21, and, mi, 11, respectively, months, after, having, mocked, the, same, through, advertisements, the, reason, cited, is, reducing, environmental, footprint, though, reaching, raised, charging, rates, supported, by, newer, models, demands, a, new, charger, shipped, through, separate, packaging, with, its, own, environmental, footprint, with, the, development, of, the, pinephone, and, librem, 5, in, the, 2020s, there, are, intensified, efforts, to, make, open, source, gnu, linux, for, smartphones, a, major, alternative, to, ios, and, android, moreover, associated, software, enabled, convergence, beyond, convergent, and, hybrid, apps, by, allowing, the, smartphones, to, be, used, like, a, desktop, computer, when, connected, to, a, keyboard, mouse, and, monitor, in, the, early, 2020s, manufacturers, began, to, integrate, satellite, connectivity, into, smartphone, devices, for, use, in, remote, areas, where, local, terrestrial, communication, infrastructures, such, as, landline, and, cellular, networks, are, not, available, due, to, the, antenna, limitations, in, the, conventional, phones, in, the, early, stages, of, implementation, satellite, connectivity, would, be, limited, to, the, satellite, messaging, and, satellite, emergency, services, a, typical, smartphone, contains, a, number, of, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, integrated, circuit, ic, chips, which, in, turn, contain, billions, of, tiny, mos, field, effect, transistors, mosfets, a, typical, smartphone, contains, the, following, mos, ic, chips, some, are, also, equipped, with, an, fm, radio, receiver, a, hardware, notification, led, and, an, infrared, transmitter, for, use, as, remote, control, a, few, models, have, additional, sensors, such, as, thermometer, for, measuring, ambient, temperature, hygrometer, for, humidity, and, a, sensor, for, ultraviolet, ray, measurement, a, few, smartphones, designed, around, specific, purposes, are, equipped, with, uncommon, hardware, such, as, a, projector, samsung, beam, i8520, and, samsung, galaxy, beam, i8530, optical, zoom, lenses, samsung, galaxy, s4, zoom, and, samsung, galaxy, k, zoom, thermal, camera, and, even, pmr446, walkie, talkie, radio, transceiver, smartphones, have, central, processing, units, cpus, similar, to, those, in, computers, but, optimised, to, operate, in, low, power, environments, in, smartphones, the, cpu, is, typically, integrated, in, a, cmos, complementary, metal, oxide, semiconductor, system, on, a, chip, soc, application, processor, the, performance, of, mobile, cpu, depends, not, only, on, the, clock, rate, generally, given, in, multiples, of, hertz, but, also, on, the, memory, hierarchy, because, of, these, challenges, the, performance, of, mobile, phone, cpus, is, often, more, appropriately, given, by, scores, derived, from, various, standardized, tests, to, measure, the, real, effective, performance, in, commonly, used, applications, smartphones, are, typically, equipped, with, a, power, button, and, volume, buttons, some, pairs, of, volume, buttons, are, unified, some, are, equipped, with, a, dedicated, camera, shutter, button, units, for, outdoor, use, may, be, equipped, with, an, sos, emergency, call, and, ptt, push, to, talk, button, the, presence, of, physical, front, side, buttons, such, as, the, home, and, navigation, buttons, has, decreased, throughout, the, 2010s, increasingly, becoming, replaced, by, capacitive, touch, sensors, and, simulated, on, screen, buttons, as, with, classic, mobile, phones, early, smartphones, such, as, the, samsung, omnia, ii, were, equipped, with, buttons, for, accepting, and, declining, phone, calls, due, to, the, advancements, of, functionality, besides, phone, calls, these, have, increasingly, been, replaced, by, navigation, buttons, such, as, menu, also, known, as, options, back, and, tasks, some, early, 2010s, smartphones, such, as, the, htc, desire, were, additionally, equipped, with, a, search, button, for, quick, access, to, a, web, search, engine, or, apps, internal, search, feature, since, 2013, smartphones, home, buttons, started, integrating, fingerprint, scanners, starting, with, the, iphone, 5s, and, samsung, galaxy, s5, functions, may, be, assigned, to, button, combinations, for, example, screenshots, can, usually, be, taken, using, the, home, and, power, buttons, with, a, short, press, on, ios, and, one, second, holding, android, os, the, two, most, popular, mobile, operating, systems, on, smartphones, with, no, physical, home, button, usually, the, volume, down, button, is, instead, pressed, with, the, power, button, some, smartphones, have, a, screenshot, and, possibly, screencast, shortcuts, in, the, navigation, button, bar, or, the, power, button, menu, one, of, the, main, characteristics, of, smartphones, is, the, screen, depending, on, the, device, s, design, the, screen, fills, most, or, nearly, all, of, the, space, on, a, device, s, front, surface, many, smartphone, displays, have, an, aspect, ratio, of, 16, 9, but, taller, aspect, ratios, became, more, common, in, 2017, as, well, as, the, aim, to, eliminate, bezels, by, extending, the, display, surface, to, as, close, to, the, edges, as, possible, screen, sizes, are, measured, in, diagonal, inches, phones, with, screens, larger, than, 5, 2, inches, are, often, called, phablets, smartphones, with, screens, over, 4, 5, inches, in, size, are, commonly, difficult, to, use, with, only, a, single, hand, since, most, thumbs, cannot, reach, the, entire, screen, surface, they, may, need, to, be, shifted, around, in, the, hand, held, in, one, hand, and, manipulated, by, the, other, or, used, in, place, with, both, hands, due, to, design, advances, some, modern, smartphones, with, large, screen, sizes, and, edge, to, edge, designs, have, compact, builds, that, improve, their, ergonomics, while, the, shift, to, taller, aspect, ratios, have, resulted, in, phones, that, have, larger, screen, sizes, whilst, maintaining, the, ergonomics, associated, with, smaller, 16, 9, displays, liquid, crystal, displays, lcds, and, organic, light, emitting, diode, oled, displays, are, the, most, common, some, displays, are, integrated, with, pressure, sensitive, digitizers, such, as, those, developed, by, wacom, and, samsung, and, apple, s, force, touch, system, a, few, phones, such, as, the, yotaphone, prototype, are, equipped, with, a, low, power, electronic, paper, rear, display, as, used, in, e, book, readers, some, devices, are, equipped, with, additional, input, methods, such, as, a, stylus, for, higher, precision, input, and, hovering, detection, or, a, self, capacitive, touch, screens, layer, for, floating, finger, detection, the, latter, has, been, implemented, on, few, phones, such, as, the, samsung, galaxy, s4, note, 3, s5, alpha, and, sony, xperia, sola, making, the, galaxy, note, 3, the, only, smartphone, with, both, so, far, hovering, can, enable, preview, tooltips, such, as, on, the, video, player, s, seek, bar, in, text, messages, and, quick, contacts, on, the, dial, pad, as, well, as, lock, screen, animations, and, the, simulation, of, a, hovering, mouse, cursor, on, web, sites, some, styluses, support, hovering, as, well, and, are, equipped, with, a, button, for, quick, access, to, relevant, tools, such, as, digital, post, it, notes, and, highlighting, of, text, and, elements, when, dragging, while, pressed, resembling, drag, selection, using, a, computer, mouse, some, series, such, as, the, samsung, galaxy, note, series, and, lg, g, stylus, series, have, an, integrated, tray, to, store, the, stylus, in, few, devices, such, as, the, iphone, 6s, until, iphone, xs, and, huawei, mate, s, are, equipped, with, a, pressure, sensitive, touch, screen, where, the, pressure, may, be, used, to, simulate, a, gas, pedal, in, video, games, access, to, preview, windows, and, shortcut, menus, controlling, the, typing, cursor, and, a, weight, scale, the, latest, of, which, has, been, rejected, by, apple, from, the, app, store, some, early, 2010s, htc, smartphones, such, as, the, htc, desire, bravo, and, htc, legend, are, equipped, with, an, optical, track, pad, for, scrolling, and, selection, many, smartphones, except, apple, iphones, are, equipped, with, low, power, light, emitting, diodes, besides, the, screen, that, are, able, to, notify, the, user, about, incoming, messages, missed, calls, low, battery, levels, and, facilitate, locating, the, mobile, phone, in, darkness, with, marginial, power, consumption, to, distinguish, between, the, sources, of, notifications, the, colour, combination, and, blinking, pattern, can, vary, usually, three, diodes, in, red, green, and, blue, rgb, are, able, to, create, a, multitude, of, colour, combinations, smartphones, are, equipped, with, a, multitude, of, sensors, to, enable, system, features, and, third, party, applications, accelerometers, and, gyroscopes, enable, automatic, control, of, screen, rotation, uses, by, third, party, software, include, bubble, level, simulation, an, ambient, light, sensor, allows, for, automatic, screen, brightness, and, contrast, adjustment, and, an, rgb, sensor, enables, the, adaption, of, screen, colour, many, mobile, phones, are, also, equipped, with, a, barometer, sensor, to, measure, air, pressure, such, as, samsung, since, 2012, with, the, galaxy, s3, and, apple, since, 2014, with, the, iphone, 6, it, allows, estimating, and, detecting, changes, in, altitude, a, magnetometer, can, act, as, a, digital, compass, by, measuring, earth, s, magnetic, field, samsung, equips, their, flagship, smartphones, since, the, 2014, galaxy, s5, and, galaxy, note, 4, with, a, heart, rate, sensor, to, assist, in, fitness, related, uses, and, act, as, a, shutter, key, for, the, front, facing, camera, so, far, only, the, 2013, samsung, galaxy, s4, and, note, 3, are, equipped, with, an, ambient, temperature, sensor, and, a, humidity, sensor, and, only, the, note, 4, with, an, ultraviolet, radiation, sensor, which, could, warn, the, user, about, excessive,

phones, starting, with, lg, g3, and, lg, v10, due, to, their, currently, rare, occurrence, among, smartphones, not, much, software, to, utilize, these, sensors, has, been, developed, yet, while, emmc, embedded, multi, media, card, flash, storage, was, most, commonly, used, in, mobile, phones, its, successor, ufs, universal, flash, storage, with, higher, transfer, rates, emerged, throughout, the, 2010s, for, upper, class, devices, while, the, internal, storage, capacity, of, mobile, phones, has, been, near, stagnant, during, the, first, half, of, the, 2010s, it, has, increased, steeper, during, its, second, half, with, samsung, for, example, increasing, the, available, internal, storage, options, of, their, flagship, class, units, from, 32, gb, to, 512, gb, within, only, 2, 1, 2, years, between, 2016, and, 2018, the, space, for, data, storage, of, some, mobile, phones, can, be, expanded, using, microsd, memory, cards, whose, capacity, has, multiplied, throughout, the, 2010s, sd, card, 2009, 2019, sdxc, benefits, over, usb, on, the, go, storage, and, cloud, storage, include, offline, availability, and, privacy, not, reserving, and, protruding, from, the, charging, port, no, connection, instability, or, latency, no, dependence, on, voluminous, data, plans, and, preservation, of, the, limited, rewriting, cycles, of, the, device, s, permanent, internal, storage, large, amounts, of, data, can, be, moved, immediately, between, devices, by, changing, memory, cards, large, scale, data, backups, can, be, created, offline, and, data, can, be, read, externally, should, the, smartphone, be, inoperable, in, case, of, technical, defects, which, make, the, device, unusable, or, un, bootable, as, a, result, of, liquid, damage, fall, damage, screen, damage, bending, damage, malware, or, bogus, system, updates, etc, data, stored, on, the, memory, card, is, likely, rescueable, externally, while, data, on, the, inaccessible, internal, storage, would, be, lost, a, memory, card, can, usually, immediately, be, re, used, in, a, different, memory, card, enabled, device, with, no, necessity, for, prior, file, transfers, some, dual, sim, mobile, phones, are, equipped, with, a, hybrid, slot, where, one, of, the, two, slots, can, be, occupied, by, either, a, sim, card, or, a, memory, card, some, models, typically, of, higher, end, are, equipped, with, three, slots, including, one, dedicated, memory, card, slot, for, simultaneous, dual, sim, and, memory, card, usage, the, location, of, both, sim, and, memory, card, slots, vary, among, devices, where, they, might, be, located, accessibly, behind, the, back, cover, or, else, behind, the, battery, the, latter, of, which, denies, hot, swapping, mobile, phones, with, non, removable, rear, cover, typically, house, sim, and, memory, cards, in, a, small, tray, on, the, handset, s, frame, ejected, by, inserting, a, needle, tool, into, a, pinhole, some, earlier, mid, range, phones, such, as, the, 2011, samsung, galaxy, fit, and, ace, have, a, sideways, memory, card, slot, on, the, frame, covered, by, a, cap, that, can, be, opened, without, tool, originally, mass, storage, access, was, commonly, enabled, to, computers, through, usb, over, time, mass, storage, access, was, removed, leaving, the, media, transfer, protocol, as, protocol, for, usb, file, transfer, due, to, its, non, exclusive, access, ability, where, the, computer, is, able, to, access, the, storage, without, it, being, locked, away, from, the, mobile, phone, s, software, for, the, duration, of, the, connection, and, no, necessity, for, common, file, system, support, as, communication, is, done, through, an, abstraction, layer, however, unlike, mass, storage, media, transfer, protocol, lacks, parallelism, meaning, that, only, a, single, transfer, can, run, at, a, time, for, which, other, transfer, requests, need, to, wait, to, finish, this, for, example, denies, browsing, photos, and, playing, back, videos, from, the, device, during, an, active, file, transfer, some, programs, and, devices, lack, support, for, mtp, in, addition, the, direct, access, and, random, access, of, files, through, mtp, is, not, supported, any, file, is, wholly, downloaded, from, the, device, before, opened, some, audio, quality, enhancing, features, such, as, voice, over, lte, and, hd, voice, have, appeared, and, are, often, available, on, newer, smartphones, sound, quality, can, remain, a, problem, due, to, the, design, of, the, phone, the, quality, of, the, cellular, network, and, compression, algorithms, used, in, long, distance, calls, audio, quality, can, be, improved, using, a, voip, application, over, wi, fi, cellphones, have, small, speakers, so, that, the, user, can, use, a, speakerphone, feature, and, talk, to, a, person, on, the, phone, without, holding, it, to, their, ear, the, small, speakers, can, also, be, used, to, listen, to, digital, audio, files, of, music, or, speech, or, watch, videos, with, an, audio, component, without, holding, the, phone, close, to, the, ear, however, integrated, speakers, may, be, small, and, of, restricted, sound, quality, to, conserve, space, some, mobile, phones, such, as, the, htc, one, m8, and, the, sony, xperia, z2, are, equipped, with, stereophonic, speakers, to, create, spacial, sound, when, in, horizontal, orientation, the, 3, 5mm, headphone, receptible, coll, headphone, jack, allows, the, immediate, operation, of, passive, headphones, as, well, as, connection, to, other, external, auxiliary, audio, appliances, among, devices, equipped, with, the, connector, it, is, more, commonly, located, at, the, bottom, charging, port, side, than, on, the, top, of, the, device, the, decline, of, the, connector, s, availability, among, newly, released, mobile, phones, among, all, major, vendors, commenced, in, 2016, with, its, lack, on, the, apple, iphone, 7, an, adapter, reserving, the, charging, port, can, retrofit, the, plug, battery, powered, wireless, bluetooth, headphones, are, an, alternative, those, tend, to, be, costlier, however, due, to, their, need, for, internal, hardware, such, as, a, bluetooth, transceiver, and, a, battery, with, a, charging, controller, and, a, bluetooth, coupling, is, required, ahead, of, each, operation, smartphones, typically, feature, lithium, ion, or, lithium, polymer, batteries, due, to, their, high, energy, densities, batteries, chemically, wear, down, as, a, result, of, repeated, charging, and, discharging, throughout, ordinary, usage, losing, both, energy, capacity, and, output, power, which, results, in, loss, of, processing, speeds, followed, by, system, outages, battery, capacity, may, be, reduced, to, 80, after, few, hundred, recharges, and, the, drop, in, performance, accelerates, with, time, some, mobile, phones, are, designed, with, batteries, that, can, be, interchanged, upon, expiration, by, the, end, user, usually, by, opening, the, back, cover, while, such, a, design, had, initially, been, used, in, most, mobile, phones, including, those, with, touch, screen, that, were, not, apple, iphones, it, has, largely, been, usurped, throughout, the, 2010s, by, permanently, built, in, non, replaceable, batteries, a, design, practice, criticized, for, planned, obsolescence, due, to, limitations, of, electrical, currents, that, existing, usb, cables, copper, wires, could, handle, charging, protocols, which, make, use, of, elevated, voltages, such, as, qualcomm, quick, charge, and, mediatek, pump, express, have, been, developed, to, increase, the, power, throughput, for, faster, charging, to, maximize, the, usage, time, without, restricted, ergonomy, and, to, minimize, the, time, a, device, needs, to, be, attached, to, a, power, source, the, smartphone, s, integrated, charge, controller, ic, requests, the, elevated, voltage, from, a, supported, charger, vooc, by, oppo, also, marketed, as, dash, charge, took, the, counter, approach, and, increased, current, to, cut, out, some, heat, produced, from, internally, regulating, the, arriving, voltage, in, the, end, device, down, to, the, battery, s, charging, terminal, voltage, but, is, incompatible, with, existing, usb, cables, as, it, requires, the, thicker, copper, wires, of, high, current, usb, cables, later, usb, power, delivery, usb, pd, was, developed, with, the, aim, to, standardize, the, negotiation, of, charging, parameters, across, devices, of, up, to, 100, watts, but, is, only, supported, on, cables, with, usb, c, on, both, endings, due, to, the, connector, s, dedicated, pd, channels, while, charging, rates, have, been, increasing, with, 15, watts, in, 2014, 20, watts, in, 2016, and, 45, watts, in, 2018, the, power, throughput, may, be, throttled, down, significantly, during, operation, of, the, device, wireless, charging, has, been, widely, adapted, allowing, for, intermittent, recharging, without, wearing, down, the, charging, port, through, frequent, reconnection, with, qi, being, the, most, common, standard, followed, by, powermat, due, to, the, lower, efficiency, of, wireless, power, transmission, charging, rates, are, below, that, of, wired, charging, and, more, heat, is, produced, at, similar, charging, rates, by, the, end, of, 2017, smartphone, battery, life, has, become, generally, adequate, however, earlier, smartphone, battery, life, was, poor, due, to, the, weak, batteries, that, could, not, handle, the, significant, power, requirements, of, the, smartphones, computer, systems, and, color, screens, smartphone, users, purchase, additional, chargers, for, use, outside, the, home, at, work, and, in, cars, and, by, buying, portable, external, battery, packs, external, battery, packs, include, generic, models, which, are, connected, to, the, smartphone, with, a, cable, and, custom, made, models, that, piggyback, onto, a, smartphone, s, case, in, 2016, samsung, had, to, recall, millions, of, the, galaxy, note, 7, smartphones, due, to, an, explosive, battery, issue, for, consumer, convenience, wireless, charging, stations, have, been, introduced, in, some, hotels, bars, and, other, public, spaces, a, technique, to, minimize, power, consumption, is, the, panel, self, refresh, whereby, the, image, to, be, shown, on, the, display, is, not, sent, at, all, times, from, the, processor, to, the, integrated, controller, ic, of, the, display, component, but, only, if, the, information, on, screen, is, changed, the, display, s, integrated, controller, instead, memorizes, the, last, screen, contents, and, refreshes, the, screen, by, itself, this, technology, was, introduced, around, 2014, and, has, reduced, power, consumption, by, a, few, hundred, milliwatts, cameras, have, become, standard, features, of, smartphones, as, of, 2019, phone, cameras, are, now, a, highly, competitive, area, of, differentiation, between, models, with, advertising, campaigns, commonly, based, on, a, focus, on, the, quality, or, capabilities, of, a, device, s, main, cameras, images, are, usually, saved, in, the, jpeg, file, format, some, high, end, phones, since, the, mid, 2010s, also, have, raw, imaging, capability, typically, smartphones, have, at, least, one, main, rear, facing, camera, and, a, lower, resolution, front, facing, camera, for, selfies, and, video, chat, owing, to, the, limited, depth, available, in, smartphones, for, image, sensors, and, optics, rear, facing, cameras, are, often, housed, in, a, bump, that, is, thicker, than, the, rest, of, the, phone, since, increasingly, thin, mobile, phones, have, more, abundant, horizontal, space, than, the, depth, that, is, necessary, and, used, in, dedicated, cameras, for, better, lenses, there, is, additionally, a,

computing, power, in, mobile, phones, enabled, fast, image, processing, and, high, resolution, filming, with, 1080p, full, hd, being, achieved, in, 2011, and, the, barrier, to, 2160p, 4k, being, breached, in, 2013, however, due, to, design, and, space, limitations, smartphones, lack, several, features, found, even, on, low, budget, compact, cameras, including, a, hot, swappable, memory, card, and, battery, for, nearly, uninterrupted, operation, physical, buttons, and, knobs, for, focusing, and, capturing, and, zooming, a, bolt, thread, tripod, mount, a, capacitor, charged, xenon, flash, that, exceeds, the, brightness, of, smartphones, led, flashlights, and, an, ergonomic, grip, for, steadier, holding, during, handheld, shooting, which, enables, longer, exposure, times, since, dedicated, cameras, can, be, more, spacious, they, can, house, larger, image, sensors, and, feature, optical, zooming, since, the, late, 2010s, smartphone, manufacturers, have, bypassed, the, lack, of, optical, zoom, to, a, limited, extent, by, incorporating, additional, rear, cameras, with, fixed, magnification, levels, in, mobile, phones, released, since, the, second, half, of, the, 2010s, operational, life, span, commonly, is, limited, by, built, in, batteries, which, are, not, designed, to, be, interchangeable, the, life, expectancy, of, batteries, depends, on, usage, intensity, of, the, powered, device, where, activity, longer, usage, and, tasks, demanding, more, energy, expire, the, battery, earlier, lithium, ion, and, lithium, polymer, batteries, those, commonly, powering, portable, electronics, additionally, wear, down, more, from, fuller, charge, and, deeper, discharge, cycles, and, when, unused, for, an, extended, amount, of, time, while, depleted, where, self, discharging, may, lead, to, a, harmful, depth, of, discharge, manufacturers, have, prevented, some, smartphones, from, operating, after, repairs, by, associating, components, unique, serial, numbers, to, the, device, so, it, will, refuse, to, operate, or, disable, some, functionality, in, case, of, a, mismatch, that, would, occur, after, a, replacement, locking, of, the, serial, number, was, first, documented, in, 2015, on, the, iphone, 6, which, would, become, inoperable, from, a, detected, replacement, of, the, home, button, later, some, functionality, was, restricted, on, apple, and, samsung, smartphones, when, a, battery, replacement, not, authorized, by, the, vendor, was, detected
