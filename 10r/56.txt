a, computer, is, a, machine, that, can, be, programmed, to, automatically, carry, out, sequences, of, arithmetic, or, logical, operations, computation, modern, digital, electronic, computers, can, perform, generic, sets, of, operations, known, as, programs, these, programs, enable, computers, to, perform, a, wide, range, of, tasks, the, term, computer, system, may, refer, to, a, nominally, complete, computer, that, includes, the, hardware, operating, system, software, and, peripheral, equipment, needed, and, used, for, full, operation, or, to, a, group, of, computers, that, are, linked, and, function, together, such, as, a, computer, network, or, computer, cluster, a, broad, range, of, industrial, and, consumer, products, use, computers, as, control, systems, including, simple, special, purpose, devices, like, microwave, ovens, and, remote, controls, and, factory, devices, like, industrial, robots, computers, are, at, the, core, of, general, purpose, devices, such, as, personal, computers, and, mobile, devices, such, as, smartphones, computers, power, the, internet, which, links, billions, of, computers, and, users, early, computers, were, meant, to, be, used, only, for, calculations, simple, manual, instruments, like, the, abacus, have, aided, people, in, doing, calculations, since, ancient, times, early, in, the, industrial, revolution, some, mechanical, devices, were, built, to, automate, long, tedious, tasks, such, as, guiding, patterns, for, looms, more, sophisticated, electrical, machines, did, specialized, analog, calculations, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, first, digital, electronic, calculating, machines, were, developed, during, world, war, ii, both, electromechanical, and, using, thermionic, valves, the, first, semiconductor, transistors, in, the, late, 1940s, were, followed, by, the, silicon, based, mosfet, mos, transistor, and, monolithic, integrated, circuit, chip, technologies, in, the, late, 1950s, leading, to, the, microprocessor, and, the, microcomputer, revolution, in, the, 1970s, the, speed, power, and, versatility, of, computers, have, been, increasing, dramatically, ever, since, then, with, transistor, counts, increasing, at, a, rapid, pace, moore, s, law, noted, that, counts, doubled, every, two, years, leading, to, the, digital, revolution, during, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, conventionally, a, modern, computer, consists, of, at, least, one, processing, element, typically, a, central, processing, unit, cpu, in, the, form, of, a, microprocessor, together, with, some, type, of, computer, memory, typically, semiconductor, memory, chips, the, processing, element, carries, out, arithmetic, and, logical, operations, and, a, sequencing, and, control, unit, can, change, the, order, of, operations, in, response, to, stored, information, peripheral, devices, include, input, devices, keyboards, mice, joystick, etc, output, devices, monitor, screens, printers, etc, and, input, output, devices, that, perform, both, functions, e, g, the, 2000s, era, touchscreen, peripheral, devices, allow, information, to, be, retrieved, from, an, external, source, and, they, enable, the, results, of, operations, to, be, saved, and, retrieved, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 20th, century, that, the, word, acquired, its, modern, definition, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, first, known, use, of, the, word, computer, was, in, a, different, sense, in, a, 1613, book, called, the, yong, mans, gleanings, by, the, english, writer, richard, brathwait, i, haue, read, the, truest, computer, of, times, and, the, best, arithmetician, that, euer, breathed, and, he, reduceth, thy, dayes, into, a, short, number, this, usage, of, the, term, referred, to, a, human, computer, a, person, who, carried, out, calculations, or, computations, the, word, continued, to, have, the, same, meaning, until, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, during, the, latter, part, of, this, period, women, were, often, hired, as, computers, because, they, could, be, paid, less, than, their, male, counterparts, by, 1943, most, human, computers, were, women, the, online, etymology, dictionary, gives, the, first, attested, use, of, computer, in, the, 1640s, meaning, one, who, calculates, this, is, an, agent, noun, from, compute, v, the, online, etymology, dictionary, states, that, the, use, of, the, term, to, mean, calculating, machine, of, any, type, is, from, 1897, the, online, etymology, dictionary, indicates, that, the, modern, use, of, the, term, to, mean, programmable, digital, electronic, computer, dates, from, 1945, under, this, name, theoretical, from, 1937, as, turing, machine, the, name, has, remained, although, modern, computers, are, capable, of, many, higher, level, functions, devices, have, been, used, to, aid, computation, for, thousands, of, years, mostly, using, one, to, one, correspondence, with, fingers, the, earliest, counting, device, was, most, likely, a, form, of, tally, stick, later, record, keeping, aids, throughout, the, fertile, crescent, included, calculi, clay, spheres, cones, etc, which, represented, counts, of, items, likely, livestock, or, grains, sealed, in, hollow, unbaked, clay, containers, the, use, of, counting, rods, is, one, example, the, abacus, was, initially, used, for, arithmetic, tasks, the, roman, abacus, was, developed, from, devices, used, in, babylonia, as, early, as, 2400, bce, since, then, many, other, forms, of, reckoning, boards, or, tables, have, been, invented, in, a, medieval, european, counting, house, a, checkered, cloth, would, be, placed, on, a, table, and, markers, moved, around, on, it, according, to, certain, rules, as, an, aid, to, calculating, sums, of, money, the, antikythera, mechanism, is, believed, to, be, the, earliest, known, mechanical, analog, computer, according, to, derek, j, de, solla, price, it, was, designed, to, calculate, astronomical, positions, it, was, discovered, in, 1901, in, the, antikythera, wreck, off, the, greek, island, of, antikythera, between, kythera, and, crete, and, has, been, dated, to, approximately, c, 100, bce, devices, of, comparable, complexity, to, the, antikythera, mechanism, would, not, reappear, until, the, fourteenth, century, many, mechanical, aids, to, calculation, and, measurement, were, constructed, for, astronomical, and, navigation, use, the, planisphere, was, a, star, chart, invented, by, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, in, the, early, 11th, century, the, astrolabe, was, invented, in, the, hellenistic, world, in, either, the, 1st, or, 2nd, centuries, bce, and, is, often, attributed, to, hipparchus, a, combination, of, the, planisphere, and, dioptra, the, astrolabe, was, effectively, an, analog, computer, capable, of, working, out, several, different, kinds, of, problems, in, spherical, astronomy, an, astrolabe, incorporating, a, mechanical, calendar, computer, and, gear, wheels, was, invented, by, abi, bakr, of, isfahan, persia, in, 1235, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, invented, the, first, mechanical, geared, lunisolar, calendar, astrolabe, an, early, fixed, wired, knowledge, processing, machine, with, a, gear, train, and, gear, wheels, c, 1000, ad, the, sector, a, calculating, instrument, used, for, solving, problems, in, proportion, trigonometry, multiplication, and, division, and, for, various, functions, such, as, squares, and, cube, roots, was, developed, in, the, late, 16th, century, and, found, application, in, gunnery, surveying, and, navigation, the, planimeter, was, a, manual, instrument, to, calculate, the, area, of, a, closed, figure, by, tracing, over, it, with, a, mechanical, linkage, the, slide, rule, was, invented, around, 1620, 1630, by, the, english, clergyman, william, oughtred, shortly, after, the, publication, of, the, concept, of, the, logarithm, it, is, a, hand, operated, analog, computer, for, doing, multiplication, and, division, as, slide, rule, development, progressed, added, scales, provided, reciprocals, squares, and, square, roots, cubes, and, cube, roots, as, well, as, transcendental, functions, such, as, logarithms, and, exponentials, circular, and, hyperbolic, trigonometry, and, other, functions, slide, rules, with, special, scales, are, still, used, for, quick, performance, of, routine, calculations, such, as, the, e6b, circular, slide, rule, used, for, time, and, distance, calculations, on, light, aircraft, in, the, 1770s, pierre, jaquet, droz, a, swiss, watchmaker, built, a, mechanical, doll, automaton, that, could, write, holding, a, quill, pen, by, switching, the, number, and, order, of, its, internal, wheels, different, letters, and, hence, different, messages, could, be, produced, in, effect, it, could, be, mechanically, programmed, to, read, instructions, along, with, two, other, complex, machines, the, doll, is, at, the, mus, e, d, art, et, d, histoire, of, neuch, tel, switzerland, and, still, operates, in, 1831, 1835, mathematician, and, engineer, giovanni, plana, devised, a, perpetual, calendar, machine, which, through, a, system, of, pulleys, and, cylinders, and, over, could, predict, the, perpetual, calendar, for, every, year, from, 0, ce, that, is, 1, bce, to, 4000, ce, keeping, track, of, leap, years, and, varying, day, length, the, tide, predicting, machine, invented, by, the, scottish, scientist, sir, william, thomson, in, 1872, was, of, great, utility, to, navigation, in, shallow, waters, it, used, a, system, of, pulleys, and, wires, to, automatically, calculate, predicted, tide, levels, for, a, set, period, at, a, particular, location, the, differential, analyser, a, mechanical, analog, computer, designed, to, solve, differential, equations, by, integration, used, wheel, and, disc, mechanisms, to, perform, the, integration, in, 1876, sir, william, thomson, had, already, discussed, the, possible, construction, of, such, calculators, but, he, had, been, stymied, by, the, limited, output, torque, of, the, ball, and, disk, integrators, in, a, differential, analyzer, the, output, of, one, integrator, drove, the, input, of, the, next, integrator, or, a, graphing, output, the, torque, amplifier, was, the, advance, that, allowed, these, machines, to, work, starting, in, the, 1920s, vannevar, bush, and, others, developed, mechanical, differential, analyzers, in, the, 1890s, the, spanish, engineer, leonardo, torres, quevedo, began, to, develop, a, series, of, advanced, analog, machines, that, could, solve, real, and, complex, roots, of, polynomials, which, were, published, in, 1901, by, the, paris, academy, of, sciences, charles, babbage, an, english, mechanical, engineer, and, polymath, originated, the, concept, of, a, programmable, computer, considered, the, father, of, the, computer, he, conceptualized, and, invented, the, first, mechanical, computer, in, the, early, 19th, century, after, working, on, his, difference, engine, he, announced, his, invention, in, 1822, in, a, paper, to, the, royal, astronomical, society, titled, note, on, the, application, of, machinery, to, the, computation, of, astronomical, and, mathematical, tables, he, also, designed, to, aid, in, navigational, calculations, in, 1833, he, realized, that, a, much, more, general, design, an, analytical, engine, was, possible, the, input, of, programs, and, data, was, to, be, provided, to, the, machine, via, punched, cards, a, method, being, used, at, the, time, to, direct, mechanical, looms, such, as, the, jacquard, loom, for, output, the, machine, would, have, a, printer, a, curve, plotter, and, a, bell, the, machine, would, also, be, able, to, punch, numbers, onto, cards, to, be, read, in, later, the, engine, would, incorporate, an, arithmetic, logic, unit, control, flow, in, the, form, of, conditional, branching, and, loops, and, integrated, memory, making, it, the, first, design, for, a, general, purpose, computer, that, could, be, described, in, modern, terms, as, turing, complete, the, machine, was, about, a, century, ahead, of, its, time, all, the, parts, for, his, machine, had, to, be, made, by, hand, this, was, a, major, problem, for, a, device, with, thousands, of, parts, eventually, the, project, was, dissolved, with, the, decision, of, the, british, government, to, cease, funding, babbage, s, failure, to, complete, the, analytical, engine, can, be, chiefly, attributed, to, political, and, financial, difficulties, as, well, as, his, desire, to, develop, an, increasingly, sophisticated, computer, and, to, move, ahead, faster, than, anyone, else, could, follow, nevertheless, his, son, henry, babbage, completed, a, simplified, version, of, the, analytical, engine, s, computing, unit, the, mill, in, 1888, he, gave, a, successful, demonstration, of, its, use, in, computing, tables, in, 1906, in, his, work, essays, on, automatics, published, in, 1914, leonardo, torres, quevedo, wrote, a, brief, history, of, babbage, s, efforts, at, constructing, a, mechanical, difference, engine, and, analytical, engine, the, paper, contains, a, design, of, a, machine, capable, to, calculate, formulas, like, a, x, y, z, 2, displaystyle, a, x, y, z, 2, for, a, sequence, of, sets, of, values, the, whole, machine, was, to, be, controlled, by, a, read, only, program, which, was, complete, with, provisions, for, conditional, branching, he, also, introduced, the, idea, of, floating, point, arithmetic, in, 1920, to, celebrate, the, 100th, anniversary, of, the, invention, of, the, arithmometer, torres, presented, in, paris, the, electromechanical, arithmometer, which, allowed, a, user, to, input, arithmetic, problems, through, a, keyboard, and, computed, and, printed, the, results, demonstrating, the, feasibility, of, an, electromechanical, analytical, engine, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, many, scientific, computing, needs, were, met, by, increasingly, sophisticated, analog, computers, which, used, a, direct, mechanical, or, electrical, model, of, the, problem, as, a, basis, for, computation, however, these, were, not, programmable, and, generally, lacked, the, versatility, and, accuracy, of, modern, digital, computers, the, first, modern, analog, computer, was, a, tide, predicting, machine, invented, by, sir, william, thomson, later, to, become, lord, kelvin, in, 1872, the, differential, analyser, a, mechanical, analog, computer, designed, to, solve, differential, equations, by, integration, using, wheel, and, disc, mechanisms, was, conceptualized, in, 1876, by, james, thomson, the, elder, brother, of, the, more, famous, sir, william, thomson, the, art, of, mechanical, analog, computing, reached, its, zenith, with, the, differential, analyzer, built, by, h, l, hazen, and, vannevar, bush, at, mit, starting, in, 1927, this, built, on, the, mechanical, integrators, of, james, thomson, and, the, torque, amplifiers, invented, by, h, w, nieman, a, dozen, of, these, devices, were, built, before, their, obsolescence, became, obvious, by, the, 1950s, the, success, of, digital, electronic, computers, had, spelled, the, end, for, most, analog, computing, machines, but, analog, computers, remained, in, use, during, the, 1950s, in, some, specialized, applications, such, as, education, slide, rule, and, aircraft, control, systems, by, 1938, the, united, states, navy, had, developed, an, electromechanical, analog, computer, small, enough, to, use, aboard, a, submarine, this, was, the, torpedo, data, computer, which, used, trigonometry, to, solve, the, problem, of, firing, a, torpedo, at, a, moving, target, during, world, war, ii, similar, devices, were, developed, in, other, countries, as, well, early, digital, computers, were, electromechanical, electric, switches, drove, mechanical, relays, to, perform, the, calculation, these, devices, had, a, low, operating, speed, and, were, eventually, superseded, by, much, faster, all, electric, computers, originally, using, vacuum, tubes, the, z2, created, by, german, engineer, konrad, zuse, in, 1939, in, berlin, was, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, an, electromechanical, relay, computer, in, 1941, zuse, followed, his, earlier, machine, up, with, the, z3, the, world, s, first, working, electromechanical, programmable, fully, automatic, digital, computer, the, z3, was, built, with, 2000, relays, implementing, a, 22, bit, word, length, that, operated, at, a, clock, frequency, of, about, 5, 10, hz, program, code, was, supplied, on, punched, film, while, data, could, be, stored, in, 64, words, of, memory, or, supplied, from, the, keyboard, it, was, quite, similar, to, modern, machines, in, some, respects, pioneering, numerous, advances, such, as, floating, point, numbers, rather, than, the, harder, to, implement, decimal, system, used, in, charles, babbage, s, earlier, design, using, a, binary, system, meant, that, zuse, s, machines, were, easier, to, build, and, potentially, more, reliable, given, the, technologies, available, at, that, time, the, z3, was, not, itself, a, universal, computer, but, could, be, extended, to, be, turing, complete, zuse, s, next, computer, the, z4, became, the, world, s, first, commercial, computer, after, initial, delay, due, to, the, second, world, war, it, was, completed, in, 1950, and, delivered, to, the, eth, zurich, the, computer, was, manufactured, by, zuse, s, own, company, zuse, kg, which, was, founded, in, 1941, as, the, first, company, with, the, sole, purpose, of, developing, computers, in, berlin, purely, electronic, circuit, elements, soon, replaced, their, mechanical, and, electromechanical, equivalents, at, the, same, time, that, digital, calculation, replaced, analog, the, engineer, tommy, flowers, working, at, the, post, office, research, station, in, london, in, the, 1930s, began, to, explore, the, possible, use, of, electronics, for, the, telephone, exchange, experimental, equipment, that, he, built, in, 1934, went, into, operation, five, years, later, converting, a, portion, of, the, telephone, exchange, network, into, an, electronic, data, processing, system, using, thousands, of, vacuum, tubes, in, the, us, john, vincent, atanasoff, and, clifford, e, berry, of, iowa, state, university, developed, and, tested, the, atanasoff, berry, computer, abc, in, 1942, the, first, automatic, electronic, digital, computer, this, design, was, also, all, electronic, and, used, about, 300, vacuum, tubes, with, capacitors, fixed, in, a, mechanically, rotating, drum, for, memory, during, world, war, ii, the, british, code, breakers, at, bletchley, park, achieved, a, number, of, successes, at, breaking, encrypted, german, military, communications, the, german, encryption, machine, enigma, was, first, attacked, with, the, help, of, the, electro, mechanical, bombes, which, were, often, run, by, women, to, crack, the, more, sophisticated, german, lorenz, sz, 40, 42, machine, used, for, high, level, army, communications, max, newman, and, his, colleagues, commissioned, flowers, to, build, the, colossus, he, spent, eleven, months, from, early, february, 1943, designing, and, building, the, first, colossus, after, a, functional, test, in, december, 1943, colossus, was, shipped, to, bletchley, park, where, it, was, delivered, on, 18, january, 1944, and, attacked, its, first, message, on, 5, february, colossus, was, the, world, s, first, electronic, digital, programmable, computer, it, used, a, large, number, of, valves, vacuum, tubes, it, had, paper, tape, input, and, was, capable, of, being, configured, to, perform, a, variety, of, boolean, logical, operations, on, its, data, but, it, was, not, turing, complete, nine, mk, ii, colossi, were, built, the, mk, i, was, converted, to, a, mk, ii, making, ten, machines, in, total, colossus, mark, i, contained, 1, 500, thermionic, valves, tubes, but, mark, ii, with, 2, 400, valves, was, both, five, times, faster, and, simpler, to, operate, than, mark, i, greatly, speeding, the, decoding, process, the, eniac, electronic, numerical, integrator, and, computer, was, the, first, electronic, programmable, computer, built, in, the, u, s, although, the, eniac, was, similar, to, the, colossus, it, was, much, faster, more, flexible, and, it, was, turing, complete, like, the, colossus, a, program, on, the, eniac, was, defined, by, the, states, of, its, patch, cables, and, switches, a, far, cry, from, the, stored, program, electronic, machines, that, came, later, once, a, program, was, written, it, had, to, be, mechanically, set, into, the, machine, with, manual, resetting, of, plugs, and, switches, the, programmers, of, the, eniac, were, six, women, often, known, collectively, as, the, eniac, girls, it, combined, the, high, speed, of, electronics, with, the, ability, to, be, programmed, for, many, complex, problems, it, could, add, or, subtract, 5000, times, a, second, a, thousand, times, faster, than, any, other, machine, it, also, had, modules, to, multiply, divide, and, square, root, high, speed, memory, was, limited, to, 20, words, about, 80, bytes, built, under, the, direction, of, john, mauchly, and, j, presper, eckert, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, eniac, s, development, and, construction, lasted, from, 1943, to, full, operation, at, the, end, of, 1945, the, machine, was, huge, weighing, 30, tons, using, 200, kilowatts, of, electric, power, and, contained, over, 18, 000, vacuum, tubes, 1, 500, relays, and, hundreds, of, thousands, of, resistors, capacitors, and, inductors, the, principle, of, the, modern, computer, was, proposed, by, alan, turing, in, his, seminal, 1936, paper, on, computable, numbers, turing, proposed, a, simple, device, that, he, called, universal, computing, machine, and, that, is, now, known, as, a, universal, turing, machine, he, proved, that, such, a, machine, is, capable, of, computing, anything, that, is, computable, by, executing, instructions, program, stored, on, tape, allowing, the, machine, to, be, programmable, the, fundamental, concept, of, turing, s, design, is, the, stored, program, where, all, the, instructions, for, computing, are, stored, in, memory, von, neumann, acknowledged, that, the, central, concept, of, the, modern, computer, was, due, to, this, paper, turing, machines, are, to, this, day, a, central, object, of, study, in, theory, of, computation, except, for, the, limitations, imposed, by, their, finite, memory, stores, modern, computers, are, said, to, be, turing, complete, which, is, to, say, they, have, algorithm, execution, capability, equivalent, to, a, universal, turing, machine, early, computing, machines, had, fixed, programs, changing, its, function, required, the, re, wiring, and, re, structuring, of, the, machine, with, the, proposal, of, the, stored, program, computer, this, changed, a, stored, program, computer, includes, by, design, an, instruction, set, and, can, store, in, memory, a, set, of, instructions, a, program, that, details, the, computation, the, theoretical, basis, for, the, stored, program, computer, was, laid, out, by, alan, turing, in, his, 1936, paper, in, 1945, turing, joined, the, national, physical, laboratory, and, began, work, on, developing, an, electronic, stored, program, digital, computer, his, 1945, report, proposed, electronic, calculator, was, the, first, specification, for, such, a, device, john, von, neumann, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, also, circulated, his, first, draft, of, a, report, on, the, edvac, in, 1945, the, manchester, baby, was, the, world, s, first, stored, program, computer, it, was, built, at, the, university, of, manchester, in, england, by, frederic, c, williams, tom, kilburn, and, geoff, tootill, and, ran, its, first, program, on, 21, june, 1948, it, was, designed, as, a, testbed, for, the, williams, tube, the, first, random, access, digital, storage, device, although, the, computer, was, described, as, small, and, primitive, by, a, 1998, retrospective, it, was, the, first, working, machine, to, contain, all, of, the, elements, essential, to, a, modern, electronic, computer, as, soon, as, the, baby, had, demonstrated, the, feasibility, of, its, design, a, project, began, at, the, university, to, develop, it, into, a, practically, useful, computer, the, manchester, mark, 1, the, mark, 1, in, turn, quickly, became, the, prototype, for, the, ferranti, mark, 1, the, world, s, first, commercially, available, general, purpose, computer, built, by, ferranti, it, was, delivered, to, the, university, of, manchester, in, february, 1951, at, least, seven, of, these, later, machines, were, delivered, between, 1953, and, 1957, one, of, them, to, shell, labs, in, amsterdam, in, october, 1947, the, directors, of, british, catering, company, j, lyons, company, decided, to, take, an, active, role, in, promoting, the, commercial, development, of, computers, lyons, s, leo, i, computer, modelled, closely, on, the, cambridge, edsac, of, 1949, became, operational, in, april, 1951, and, ran, the, world, s, first, routine, office, computer, job, the, concept, of, a, field, effect, transistor, was, proposed, by, julius, edgar, lilienfeld, in, 1925, john, bardeen, and, walter, brattain, while, working, under, william, shockley, at, bell, labs, built, the, first, working, transistor, the, point, contact, transistor, in, 1947, which, was, followed, by, shockley, s, bipolar, junction, transistor, in, 1948, from, 1955, onwards, transistors, replaced, vacuum, tubes, in, computer, designs, giving, rise, to, the, second, generation, of, computers, compared, to, vacuum, tubes, transistors, have, many, advantages, they, are, smaller, and, require, less, power, than, vacuum, tubes, so, give, off, less, heat, junction, transistors, were, much, more, reliable, than, vacuum, tubes, and, had, longer, indefinite, service, life, transistorized, computers, could, contain, tens, of, thousands, of, binary, logic, circuits, in, a, relatively, compact, space, however, early, junction, transistors, were, relatively, bulky, devices, that, were, difficult, to, manufacture, on, a, mass, production, basis, which, limited, them, to, a, number, of, specialized, applications, at, the, university, of, manchester, a, team, under, the, leadership, of, tom, kilburn, designed, and, built, a, machine, using, the, newly, developed, transistors, instead, of, valves, their, first, transistorized, computer, and, the, first, in, the, world, was, operational, by, 1953, and, a, second, version, was, completed, there, in, april, 1955, however, the, machine, did, make, use, of, valves, to, generate, its, 125, khz, clock, waveforms, and, in, the, circuitry, to, read, and, write, on, its, magnetic, drum, memory, so, it, was, not, the, first, completely, transistorized, computer, that, distinction, goes, to, the, harwell, cadet, of, 1955, built, by, the, electronics, division, of, the, atomic, energy, research, establishment, at, harwell, the, metal, oxide, silicon, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, also, known, as, the, mos, transistor, was, invented, by, mohamed, m, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, at, bell, labs, in, 1959, it, was, the, first, truly, compact, transistor, that, could, be, miniaturized, and, mass, produced, for, a, wide, range, of, uses, with, its, high, scalability, and, much, lower, power, consumption, and, higher, density, than, bipolar, junction, transistors, the, mosfet, made, it, possible, to, build, high, density, integrated, circuits, in, addition, to, data, processing, it, also, enabled, the, practical, use, of, mos, transistors, as, memory, cell, storage, elements, leading, to, the, development, of, mos, semiconductor, memory, which, replaced, earlier, magnetic, core, memory, in, computers, the, mosfet, led, to, the, microcomputer, revolution, and, became, the, driving, force, behind, the, computer, revolution, the, mosfet, is, the, most, widely, used, transistor, in, computers, and, is, the, fundamental, building, block, of, digital, electronics, the, next, great, advance, in, computing, power, came, with, the, advent, of, the, integrated, circuit, ic, the, idea, of, the, integrated, circuit, was, first, conceived, by, a, radar, scientist, working, for, the, royal, radar, establishment, of, the, ministry, of, defence, geoffrey, w, a, dummer, dummer, presented, the, first, public, description, of, an, integrated, circuit, at, the, symposium, on, progress, in, quality, electronic, components, in, washington, d, c, on, 7, may, 1952, the, first, working, ics, were, invented, by, jack, kilby, at, texas, instruments, and, robert, noyce, at, fairchild, semiconductor, kilby, recorded, his, initial, ideas, concerning, the, integrated, circuit, in, july, 1958, successfully, demonstrating, the, first, working, integrated, example, on, 12, september, 1958, in, his, patent, application, of, 6, february, 1959, kilby, described, his, new, device, as, a, body, of, semiconductor, material, wherein, all, the, components, of, the, electronic, circuit, are, completely, integrated, however, kilby, s, invention, was, a, hybrid, integrated, circuit, hybrid, ic, rather, than, a, monolithic, integrated, circuit, ic, chip, kilby, s, ic, had, external, wire, connections, which, made, it, difficult, to, mass, produce, noyce, also, came, up, with, his, own, idea, of, an, integrated, circuit, half, a, year, later, than, kilby, noyce, s, invention, was, the, first, true, monolithic, ic, chip, his, chip, solved, many, practical, problems, that, kilby, s, had, not, produced, at, fairchild, semiconductor, it, was, made, of, silicon, whereas, kilby, s, chip, was, made, of, germanium, noyce, s, monolithic, ic, was, fabricated, using, the, planar, process, developed, by, his, colleague, jean, hoerni, in, early, 1959, in, turn, the, planar, process, was, based, on, mohamed, m, atalla, s, work, on, semiconductor, surface, passivation, by, silicon, dioxide, in, the, late, 1950s, modern, monolithic, ics, are, predominantly, mos, metal, oxide, semiconductor, integrated, circuits, built, from, mosfets, mos, transistors, the, earliest, experimental, mos, ic, to, be, fabricated, was, a, 16, transistor, chip, built, by, fred, heiman, and, steven, hofstein, at, rca, in, 1962, general, microelectronics, later, introduced, the, first, commercial, mos, ic, in, 1964, developed, by, robert, norman, following, the, development, of, the, self, aligned, gate, silicon, gate, mos, transistor, by, robert, kerwin, donald, klein, and, john, sarace, at, bell, labs, in, 1967, the, first, silicon, gate, mos, ic, with, self, aligned, gates, was, developed, by, federico, faggin, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1968, the, mosfet, has, since, become, the, most, critical, device, component, in, modern, ics, the, development, of, the, mos, integrated, circuit, led, to, the, invention, of, the, microprocessor, and, heralded, an, explosion, in, the, commercial, and, personal, use, of, computers, while, the, subject, of, exactly, which, device, was, the, first, microprocessor, is, contentious, partly, due, to, lack, of, agreement, on, the, exact, definition, of, the, term, microprocessor, it, is, largely, undisputed, that, the, first, single, chip, microprocessor, was, the, intel, 4004, designed, and, realized, by, federico, faggin, with, his, silicon, gate, mos, ic, technology, along, with, ted, hoff, masatoshi, shima, and, stanley, mazor, at, intel, in, the, early, 1970s, mos, ic, technology, enabled, the, integration, of, more, than, 10, 000, transistors, on, a, single, chip, system, on, a, chip, socs, are, complete, computers, on, a, microchip, or, chip, the, size, of, a, coin, they, may, or, may, not, have, integrated, ram, and, flash, memory, if, not, integrated, the, ram, is, usually, placed, directly, above, known, as, package, on, package, or, below, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, circuit, board, the, soc, and, the, flash, memory, is, usually, placed, right, next, to, the, soc, this, all, done, to, improve, data, transfer, speeds, as, the, data, signals, do, not, have, to, travel, long, distances, since, eniac, in, 1945, computers, have, advanced, enormously, with, modern, socs, such, as, the, snapdragon, 865, being, the, size, of, a, coin, while, also, being, hundreds, of, thousands, of, times, more, powerful, than, eniac, integrating, billions, of, transistors, and, consuming, only, a, few, watts, of, power, the, first, mobile, computers, were, heavy, and, ran, from, mains, power, the, 50, lb, 23, kg, ibm, 5100, was, an, early, example, later, portables, such, as, the, osborne, 1, and, compaq, portable, were, considerably, lighter, but, still, needed, to, be, plugged, in, the, first, laptops, such, as, the, grid, compass, removed, this, requirement, by, incorporating, batteries, and, with, the, continued, miniaturization, of, computing, resources, and, advancements, in, portable, battery, life, portable, computers, grew, in, popularity, in, the, 2000s, the, same, developments, allowed, manufacturers, to, integrate, computing, resources, into, cellular, mobile, phones, by, the, early, 2000s, these, smartphones, and, tablets, run, on, a, variety, of, operating, systems, and, recently, became, the, dominant, computing, device, on, the, market, these, are, powered, by, system, on, a, chip, socs, which, are, complete, computers, on, a, microchip, the, size, of, a, coin, computers, can, be, classified, in, a, number, of, different, ways, including, the, term, hardware, covers, all, of, those, parts, of, a, computer, that, are, tangible, physical, objects, circuits, computer, chips, graphic, cards, sound, cards, memory, ram, motherboard, displays, power, supplies, cables, keyboards, printers, and, mice, input, devices, are, all, hardware, a, general, purpose, computer, has, four, main, components, the, arithmetic, logic, unit, alu, the, control, unit, the, memory, and, the, input, and, output, devices, collectively, termed, i, o, these, parts, are, interconnected, by, buses, often, made, of, groups, of, wires, inside, each, of, these, parts, are, thousands, to, trillions, of, small, electrical, circuits, which, can, be, turned, off, or, on, by, means, of, an, electronic, switch, each, circuit, represents, a, bit, binary, digit, of, information, so, that, when, the, circuit, is, on, it, represents, a, 1, and, when, off, it, represents, a, 0, in, positive, logic, representation, the, circuits, are, arranged, in, logic, gates, so, that, one, or, more, of, the, circuits, may, control, the, state, of, one, or, more, of, the, other, circuits, when, unprocessed, data, is, sent, to, the, computer, with, the, help, of, input, devices, the, data, is, processed, and, sent, to, output, devices, the, input, devices, may, be, hand, operated, or, automated, the, act, of, processing, is, mainly, regulated, by, the, cpu, some, examples, of, input, devices, are, the, means, through, which, computer, gives, output, are, known, as, output, devices, some, examples, of, output, devices, are, the, control, unit, often, called, a, control, system, or, central, controller, manages, the, computer, s, various, components, it, reads, and, interprets, decodes, the, program, instructions, transforming, them, into, control, signals, that, activate, other, parts, of, the, computer, control, systems, in, advanced, computers, may, change, the, order, of, execution, of, some, instructions, to, improve, performance, a, key, component, common, to, all, cpus, is, the, program, counter, a, special, memory, cell, a, register, that, keeps, track, of, which, location, in, memory, the, next, instruction, is, to, be, read, from, the, control, system, s, function, is, as, follows, this, is, a, simplified, description, and, some, of, these, steps, may, be, performed, concurrently, or, in, a, different, order, depending, on, the, type, of, cpu, since, the, program, counter, is, conceptually, just, another, set, of, memory, cells, it, can, be, changed, by, calculations, done, in, the, alu, adding, 100, to, the, program, counter, would, cause, the, next, instruction, to, be, read, from, a, place, 100, locations, further, down, the, program, instructions, that, modify, the, program, counter, are, often, known, as, jumps, and, allow, for, loops, instructions, that, are, repeated, by, the, computer, and, often, conditional, instruction, execution, both, examples, of, control, flow, the, sequence, of, operations, that, the, control, unit, goes, through, to, process, an, instruction, is, in, itself, like, a, short, computer, program, and, indeed, in, some, more, complex, cpu, designs, there, is, another, yet, smaller, computer, called, a, microsequencer, which, runs, a, microcode, program, that, causes, all, of, these, events, to, happen, the, control, unit, alu, and, registers, are, collectively, known, as, a, central, processing, unit, cpu, early, cpus, were, composed, of, many, separate, components, since, the, 1970s, cpus, have, typically, been, constructed, on, a, single, mos, integrated, circuit, chip, called, a, microprocessor, the, alu, is, capable, of, performing, two, classes, of, operations, arithmetic, and, logic, the, set, of, arithmetic, operations, that, a, particular, alu, supports, may, be, limited, to, addition, and, subtraction, or, might, include, multiplication, division, trigonometry, functions, such, as, sine, cosine, etc, and, square, roots, some, can, operate, only, on, whole, numbers, integers, while, others, use, floating, point, to, represent, real, numbers, albeit, with, limited, precision, however, any, computer, that, is, capable, of, performing, just, the, simplest, operations, can, be, programmed, to, break, down, the, more, complex, operations, into, simple, steps, that, it, can, perform, therefore, any, computer, can, be, programmed, to, perform, any, arithmetic, operation, although, it, will, take, more, time, to, do, so, if, its, alu, does, not, directly, support, the, operation, an, alu, may, also, compare, numbers, and, return, boolean, truth, values, true, or, false, depending, on, whether, one, is, equal, to, greater, than, or, less, than, the, other, is, 64, greater, than, 65, logic, operations, involve, boolean, logic, and, or, xor, and, not, these, can, be, useful, for, creating, complicated, conditional, statements, and, processing, boolean, logic, superscalar, computers, may, contain, multiple, alus, allowing, them, to, process, several, instructions, simultaneously, graphics, processors, and, computers, with, simd, and, mimd, features, often, contain, alus, that, can, perform, arithmetic, on, vectors, and, matrices, a, computer, s, memory, can, be, viewed, as, a, list, of, cells, into, which, numbers, can, be, placed, or, read, each, cell, has, a, numbered, address, and, can, store, a, single, number, the, computer, can, be, instructed, to, put, the, number, 123, into, the, cell, numbered, 1357, or, to, add, the, number, that, is, in, cell, 1357, to, the, number, that, is, in, cell, 2468, and, put, the, answer, into, cell, 1595, the, information, stored, in, memory, may, represent, practically, anything, letters, numbers, even, computer, instructions, can, be, placed, into, memory, with, equal, ease, since, the, cpu, does, not, differentiate, between, different, types, of, information, it, is, the, software, s, responsibility, to, give, significance, to, what, the, memory, sees, as, nothing, but, a, series, of, numbers, in, almost, all, modern, computers, each, memory, cell, is, set, up, to, store, binary, numbers, in, groups, of, eight, bits, called, a, byte, each, byte, is, able, to, represent, 256, different, numbers, 2, 8, 256, either, from, 0, to, 255, or, 128, to, 127, to, store, larger, numbers, several, consecutive, bytes, may, be, used, typically, two, four, or, eight, when, negative, numbers, are, required, they, are, usually, stored, in, two, s, complement, notation, other, arrangements, are, possible, but, are, usually, not, seen, outside, of, specialized, applications, or, historical, contexts, a, computer, can, store, any, kind, of, information, in, memory, if, it, can, be, represented, numerically, modern, computers, have, billions, or, even, trillions, of, bytes, of, memory, the, cpu, contains, a, special, set, of, memory, cells, called, registers, that, can, be, read, and, written, to, much, more, rapidly, than, the, main, memory, area, there, are, typically, between, two, and, one, hundred, registers, depending, on, the, type, of, cpu, registers, are, used, for, the, most, frequently, needed, data, items, to, avoid, having, to, access, main, memory, every, time, data, is, needed, as, data, is, constantly, being, worked, on, reducing, the, need, to, access, main, memory, which, is, often, slow, compared, to, the, alu, and, control, units, greatly, increases, the, computer, s, speed, computer, main, memory, comes, in, two, principal, varieties, ram, can, be, read, and, written, to, anytime, the, cpu, commands, it, but, rom, is, preloaded, with, data, and, software, that, never, changes, therefore, the, cpu, can, only, read, from, it, rom, is, typically, used, to, store, the, computer, s, initial, start, up, instructions, in, general, the, contents, of, ram, are, erased, when, the, power, to, the, computer, is, turned, off, but, rom, retains, its, data, indefinitely, in, a, pc, the, rom, contains, a, specialized, program, called, the, bios, that, orchestrates, loading, the, computer, s, operating, system, from, the, hard, disk, drive, into, ram, whenever, the, computer, is, turned, on, or, reset, in, embedded, computers, which, frequently, do, not, have, disk, drives, all, of, the, required, software, may, be, stored, in, rom, software, stored, in, rom, is, often, called, firmware, because, it, is, notionally, more, like, hardware, than, software, flash, memory, blurs, the, distinction, between, rom, and, ram, as, it, retains, its, data, when, turned, off, but, is, also, rewritable, it, is, typically, much, slower, than, conventional, rom, and, ram, however, so, its, use, is, restricted, to, applications, where, high, speed, is, unnecessary, in, more, sophisticated, computers, there, may, be, one, or, more, ram, cache, memories, which, are, slower, than, registers, but, faster, than, main, memory, generally, computers, with, this, sort, of, cache, are, designed, to, move, frequently, needed, data, into, the, cache, automatically, often, without, the, need, for, any, intervention, on, the, programmer, s, part, i, o, is, the, means, by, which, a, computer, exchanges, information, with, the, outside, world, devices, that, provide, input, or, output, to, the, computer, are, called, peripherals, on, a, typical, personal, computer, peripherals, include, input, devices, like, the, keyboard, and, mouse, and, output, devices, such, as, the, display, and, printer, hard, disk, drives, floppy, disk, drives, and, optical, disc, drives, serve, as, both, input, and, output, devices, computer, networking, is, another, form, of, i, o, i, o, devices, are, often, complex, computers, in, their, own, right, with, their, own, cpu, and, memory, a, graphics, processing, unit, might, contain, fifty, or, more, tiny, computers, that, perform, the, calculations, necessary, to, display, 3d, graphics, modern, desktop, computers, contain, many, smaller, computers, that, assist, the, main, cpu, in, performing, i, o, a, 2016, era, flat, screen, display, contains, its, own, computer, circuitry, while, a, computer, may, be, viewed, as, running, one, gigantic, program, stored, in, its, main, memory, in, some, systems, it, is, necessary, to, give, the, appearance, of, running, several, programs, simultaneously, this, is, achieved, by, multitasking, i, e, having, the, computer, switch, rapidly, between, running, each, program, in, turn, one, means, by, which, this, is, done, is, with, a, special, signal, called, an, interrupt, which, can, periodically, cause, the, computer, to, stop, executing, instructions, where, it, was, and, do, something, else, instead, by, remembering, where, it, was, executing, prior, to, the, interrupt, the, computer, can, return, to, that, task, later, if, several, programs, are, running, at, the, same, time, then, the, interrupt, generator, might, be, causing, several, hundred, interrupts, per, second, causing, a, program, switch, each, time, since, modern, computers, typically, execute, instructions, several, orders, of, magnitude, faster, than, human, perception, it, may, appear, that, many, programs, are, running, at, the, same, time, even, though, only, one, is, ever, executing, in, any, given, instant, this, method, of, multitasking, is, sometimes, termed, time, sharing, since, each, program, is, allocated, a, slice, of, time, in, turn, before, the, era, of, inexpensive, computers, the, principal, use, for, multitasking, was, to, allow, many, people, to, share, the, same, computer, seemingly, multitasking, would, cause, a, computer, that, is, switching, between, several, programs, to, run, more, slowly, in, direct, proportion, to, the, number, of, programs, it, is, running, but, most, programs, spend, much, of, their, time, waiting, for, slow, input, output, devices, to, complete, their, tasks, if, a, program, is, waiting, for, the, user, to, click, on, the, mouse, or, press, a, key, on, the, keyboard, then, it, will, not, take, a, time, slice, until, the, event, it, is, waiting, for, has, occurred, this, frees, up, time, for, other, programs, to, execute, so, that, many, programs, may, be, run, simultaneously, without, unacceptable, speed, loss, some, computers, are, designed, to, distribute, their, work, across, several, cpus, in, a, multiprocessing, configuration, a, technique, once, employed, in, only, large, and, powerful, machines, such, as, supercomputers, mainframe, computers, and, servers, multiprocessor, and, multi, core, multiple, cpus, on, a, single, integrated, circuit, personal, and, laptop, computers, are, now, widely, available, and, are, being, increasingly, used, in, lower, end, markets, as, a, result, supercomputers, in, particular, often, have, highly, unique, architectures, that, differ, significantly, from, the, basic, stored, program, architecture, and, from, general, purpose, computers, they, often, feature, thousands, of, cpus, customized, high, speed, interconnects, and, specialized, computing, hardware, such, designs, tend, to, be, useful, for, only, specialized, tasks, due, to, the, large, scale, of, program, organization, required, to, use, most, of, the, available, resources, at, once, supercomputers, usually, see, usage, in, large, scale, simulation, graphics, rendering, and, cryptography, applications, as, well, as, with, other, so, called, embarrassingly, parallel, tasks, software, refers, to, parts, of, the, computer, which, do, not, have, a, material, form, such, as, programs, data, protocols, etc, software, is, that, part, of, a, computer, system, that, consists, of, encoded, information, or, computer, instructions, in, contrast, to, the, physical, hardware, from, which, the, system, is, built, computer, software, includes, computer, programs, libraries, and, related, non, executable, data, such, as, online, documentation, or, digital, media, it, is, often, divided, into, system, software, and, application, software, computer, hardware, and, software, require, each, other, and, neither, can, be, realistically, used, on, its, own, when, software, is, stored, in, hardware, that, cannot, easily, be, modified, such, as, with, bios, rom, in, an, ibm, pc, compatible, computer, it, is, sometimes, called, firmware, there, are, thousands, of, different, programming, languages, some, intended, for, general, purpose, others, useful, for, only, highly, specialized, applications, the, defining, feature, of, modern, computers, which, distinguishes, them, from, all, other, machines, is, that, they, can, be, programmed, that, is, to, say, that, some, type, of, instructions, the, program, can, be, given, to, the, computer, and, it, will, process, them, modern, computers, based, on, the, von, neumann, architecture, often, have, machine, code, in, the, form, of, an, imperative, programming, language, in, practical, terms, a, computer, program, may, be, just, a, few, instructions, or, extend, to, many, millions, of, instructions, as, do, the, programs, for, word, processors, and, web, browsers, for, example, a, typical, modern, computer, can, execute, billions, of, instructions, per, second, gigaflops, and, rarely, makes, a, mistake, over, many, years, of, operation, large, computer, programs, consisting, of, several, million, instructions, may, take, teams, of, programmers, years, to, write, and, due, to, the, complexity, of, the, task, almost, certainly, contain, errors, this, section, applies, to, most, common, ram, machine, based, computers, in, most, cases, computer, instructions, are, simple, add, one, number, to, another, move, some, data, from, one, location, to, another, send, a, message, to, some, external, device, etc, these, instructions, are, read, from, the, computer, s, memory, and, are, generally, carried, out, executed, in, the, order, they, were, given, however, there, are, usually, specialized, instructions, to, tell, the, computer, to, jump, ahead, or, backwards, to, some, other, place, in, the, program, and, to, carry, on, executing, from, there, these, are, called, jump, instructions, or, branches, furthermore, jump, instructions, may, be, made, to, happen, conditionally, so, that, different, sequences, of, instructions, may, be, used, depending, on, the, result, of, some, previous, calculation, or, some, external, event, many, computers, directly, support, subroutines, by, providing, a, type, of, jump, that, remembers, the, location, it, jumped, from, and, another, instruction, to, return, to, the, instruction, following, that, jump, instruction, program, execution, might, be, likened, to, reading, a, book, while, a, person, will, normally, read, each, word, and, line, in, sequence, they, may, at, times, jump, back, to, an, earlier, place, in, the, text, or, skip, sections, that, are, not, of, interest, similarly, a, computer, may, sometimes, go, back, and, repeat, the, instructions, in, some, section, of, the, program, over, and, over, again, until, some, internal, condition, is, met, this, is, called, the, flow, of, control, within, the, program, and, it, is, what, allows, the, computer, to, perform, tasks, repeatedly, without, human, intervention, comparatively, a, person, using, a, pocket, calculator, can, perform, a, basic, arithmetic, operation, such, as, adding, two, numbers, with, just, a, few, button, presses, but, to, add, together, all, of, the, numbers, from, 1, to, 1, 000, would, take, thousands, of, button, presses, and, a, lot, of, time, with, a, near, certainty, of, making, a, mistake, on, the, other, hand, a, computer, may, be, programmed, to, do, this, with, just, a, few, simple, instructions, the, following, example, is, written, in, the, mips, assembly, language, once, told, to, run, this, program, the, computer, will, perform, the, repetitive, addition, task, without, further, human, intervention, it, will, almost, never, make, a, mistake, and, a, modern, pc, can, complete, the, task, in, a, fraction, of, a, second, in, most, computers, individual, instructions, are, stored, as, machine, code, with, each, instruction, being, given, a, unique, number, its, operation, code, or, opcode, for, short, the, command, to, add, two, numbers, together, would, have, one, opcode, the, command, to, multiply, them, would, have, a, different, opcode, and, so, on, the, simplest, computers, are, able, to, perform, any, of, a, handful, of, different, instructions, the, more, complex, computers, have, several, hundred, to, choose, from, each, with, a, unique, numerical, code, since, the, computer, s, memory, is, able, to, store, numbers, it, can, also, store, the, instruction, codes, this, leads, to, the, important, fact, that, entire, programs, which, are, just, lists, of, these, instructions, can, be, represented, as, lists, of, numbers, and, can, themselves, be, manipulated, inside, the, computer, in, the, same, way, as, numeric, data, the, fundamental, concept, of, storing, programs, in, the, computer, s, memory, alongside, the, data, they, operate, on, is, the, crux, of, the, von, neumann, or, stored, program, architecture, in, some, cases, a, computer, might, store, some, or, all, of, its, program, in, memory, that, is, kept, separate, from, the, data, it, operates, on, this, is, called, the, harvard, architecture, after, the, harvard, mark, i, computer, modern, von, neumann, computers, display, some, traits, of, the, harvard, architecture, in, their, designs, such, as, in, cpu, caches, while, it, is, possible, to, write, computer, programs, as, long, lists, of, numbers, machine, language, and, while, this, technique, was, used, with, many, early, computers, it, is, extremely, tedious, and, potentially, error, prone, to, do, so, in, practice, especially, for, complicated, programs, instead, each, basic, instruction, can, be, given, a, short, name, that, is, indicative, of, its, function, and, easy, to, remember, a, mnemonic, such, as, add, sub, mult, or, jump, these, mnemonics, are, collectively, known, as, a, computer, s, assembly, language, converting, programs, written, in, assembly, language, into, something, the, computer, can, actually, understand, machine, language, is, usually, done, by, a, computer, program, called, an, assembler, programming, languages, provide, various, ways, of, specifying, programs, for, computers, to, run, unlike, natural, languages, programming, languages, are, designed, to, permit, no, ambiguity, and, to, be, concise, they, are, purely, written, languages, and, are, often, difficult, to, read, aloud, they, are, generally, either, translated, into, machine, code, by, a, compiler, or, an, assembler, before, being, run, or, translated, directly, at, run, time, by, an, interpreter, sometimes, programs, are, executed, by, a, hybrid, method, of, the, two, techniques, machine, languages, and, the, assembly, languages, that, represent, them, collectively, termed, low, level, programming, languages, are, generally, unique, to, the, particular, architecture, of, a, computer, s, central, processing, unit, cpu, for, instance, an, arm, architecture, cpu, such, as, may, be, found, in, a, smartphone, or, a, hand, held, videogame, cannot, understand, the, machine, language, of, an, x86, cpu, that, might, be, in, a, pc, historically, a, significant, number, of, other, cpu, architectures, were, created, and, saw, extensive, use, notably, including, the, mos, technology, 6502, and, 6510, in, addition, to, the, zilog, z80, although, considerably, easier, than, in, machine, language, writing, long, programs, in, assembly, language, is, often, difficult, and, is, also, error, prone, therefore, most, practical, programs, are, written, in, more, abstract, high, level, programming, languages, that, are, able, to, express, the, needs, of, the, programmer, more, conveniently, and, thereby, help, reduce, programmer, error, high, level, languages, are, usually, compiled, into, machine, language, or, sometimes, into, assembly, language, and, then, into, machine, language, using, another, computer, program, called, a, compiler, high, level, languages, are, less, related, to, the, workings, of, the, target, computer, than, assembly, language, and, more, related, to, the, language, and, structure, of, the, problem, s, to, be, solved, by, the, final, program, it, is, therefore, often, possible, to, use, different, compilers, to, translate, the, same, high, level, language, program, into, the, machine, language, of, many, different, types, of, computer, this, is, part, of, the, means, by, which, software, like, video, games, may, be, made, available, for, different, computer, architectures, such, as, personal, computers, and, various, video, game, consoles, program, design, of, small, programs, is, relatively, simple, and, involves, the, analysis, of, the, problem, collection, of, inputs, using, the, programming, constructs, within, languages, devising, or, using, established, procedures, and, algorithms, providing, data, for, output, devices, and, solutions, to, the, problem, as, applicable, as, problems, become, larger, and, more, complex, features, such, as, subprograms, modules, formal, documentation, and, new, paradigms, such, as, object, oriented, programming, are, encountered, large, programs, involving, thousands, of, line, of, code, and, more, require, formal, software, methodologies, the, task, of, developing, large, software, systems, presents, a, significant, intellectual, challenge, producing, software, with, an, acceptably, high, reliability, within, a, predictable, schedule, and, budget, has, historically, been, difficult, the, academic, and, professional, discipline, of, software, engineering, concentrates, specifically, on, this, challenge, errors, in, computer, programs, are, called, bugs, they, may, be, benign, and, not, affect, the, usefulness, of, the, program, or, have, only, subtle, effects, however, in, some, cases, they, may, cause, the, program, or, the, entire, system, to, hang, becoming, unresponsive, to, input, such, as, mouse, clicks, or, keystrokes, to, completely, fail, or, to, crash, otherwise, benign, bugs, may, sometimes, be, harnessed, for, malicious, intent, by, an, unscrupulous, user, writing, an, exploit, code, designed, to, take, advantage, of, a, bug, and, disrupt, a, computer, s, proper, execution, bugs, are, usually, not, the, fault, of, the, computer, since, computers, merely, execute, the, instructions, they, are, given, bugs, are, nearly, always, the, result, of, programmer, error, or, an, oversight, made, in, the, program, s, design, admiral, grace, hopper, an, american, computer, scientist, and, developer, of, the, first, compiler, is, credited, for, having, first, used, the, term, bugs, in, computing, after, a, dead, moth, was, found, shorting, a, relay, in, the, harvard, mark, ii, computer, in, september, 1947, computers, have, been, used, to, coordinate, information, between, multiple, locations, since, the, 1950s, the, u, s, military, s, sage, system, was, the, first, large, scale, example, of, such, a, system, which, led, to, a, number, of, special, purpose, commercial, systems, such, as, sabre, in, the, 1970s, computer, engineers, at, research, institutions, throughout, the, united, states, began, to, link, their, computers, together, using, telecommunications, technology, the, effort, was, funded, by, arpa, now, darpa, and, the, computer, network, that, resulted, was, called, the, arpanet, the, technologies, that, made, the, arpanet, possible, spread, and, evolved, in, time, the, network, spread, beyond, academic, and, military, institutions, and, became, known, as, the, internet, the, emergence, of, networking, involved, a, redefinition, of, the, nature, and, boundaries, of, the, computer, computer, operating, systems, and, applications, were, modified, to, include, the, ability, to, define, and, access, the, resources, of, other, computers, on, the, network, such, as, peripheral, devices, stored, information, and, the, like, as, extensions, of, the, resources, of, an, individual, computer, initially, these, facilities, were, available, primarily, to, people, working, in, high, tech, environments, but, in, the, 1990s, the, spread, of, applications, like, e, mail, and, the, world, wide, web, combined, with, the, development, of, cheap, fast, networking, technologies, like, ethernet, and, adsl, saw, computer, networking, become, almost, ubiquitous, in, fact, the, number, of, computers, that, are, networked, is, growing, phenomenally, a, very, large, proportion, of, personal, computers, regularly, connect, to, the, internet, to, communicate, and, receive, information, wireless, networking, often, utilizing, mobile, phone, networks, has, meant, networking, is, becoming, increasingly, ubiquitous, even, in, mobile, computing, environments, a, computer, does, not, need, to, be, electronic, nor, even, have, a, processor, nor, ram, nor, even, a, hard, disk, while, popular, usage, of, the, word, computer, is, synonymous, with, a, personal, electronic, computer, a, typical, modern, definition, of, a, computer, is, a, device, that, computes, especially, a, programmable, electronic, machine, that, performs, high, speed, mathematical, or, logical, operations, or, that, assembles, stores, correlates, or, otherwise, processes, information, according, to, this, definition, any, device, that, processes, information, qualifies, as, a, computer, there, is, active, research, to, make, non, classical, computers, out, of, many, promising, new, types, of, technology, such, as, optical, computers, dna, computers, neural, computers, and, quantum, computers, most, computers, are, universal, and, are, able, to, calculate, any, computable, function, and, are, limited, only, by, their, memory, capacity, and, operating, speed, however, different, designs, of, computers, can, give, very, different, performance, for, particular, problems, for, example, quantum, computers, can, potentially, break, some, modern, encryption, algorithms, by, quantum, factoring, very, quickly, there, are, many, types, of, computer, architectures, of, all, these, abstract, machines, a, quantum, computer, holds, the, most, promise, for, revolutionizing, computing, logic, gates, are, a, common, abstraction, which, can, apply, to, most, of, the, above, digital, or, analog, paradigms, the, ability, to, store, and, execute, lists, of, instructions, called, programs, makes, computers, extremely, versatile, distinguishing, them, from, calculators, the, church, turing, thesis, is, a, mathematical, statement, of, this, versatility, any, computer, with, a, minimum, capability, being, turing, complete, is, in, principle, capable, of, performing, the, same, tasks, that, any, other, computer, can, perform, therefore, any, type, of, computer, netbook, supercomputer, cellular, automaton, etc, is, able, to, perform, the, same, computational, tasks, given, enough, time, and, storage, capacity, a, computer, will, solve, problems, in, exactly, the, way, it, is, programmed, to, without, regard, to, efficiency, alternative, solutions, possible, shortcuts, or, possible, errors, in, the, code, computer, programs, that, learn, and, adapt, are, part, of, the, emerging, field, of, artificial, intelligence, and, machine, learning, artificial, intelligence, based, products, generally, fall, into, two, major, categories, rule, based, systems, and, pattern, recognition, systems, rule, based, systems, attempt, to, represent, the, rules, used, by, human, experts, and, tend, to, be, expensive, to, develop, pattern, based, systems, use, data, about, a, problem, to, generate, conclusions, examples, of, pattern, based, systems, include, voice, recognition, font, recognition, translation, and, the, emerging, field, of, on, line, marketing, as, the, use, of, computers, has, spread, throughout, society, there, are, an, increasing, number, of, careers, involving, computers, the, need, for, computers, to, work, well, together, and, to, be, able, to, exchange, information, has, spawned, the, need, for, many, standards, organizations, clubs, and, societies, of, both, a, formal, and, informal, nature
