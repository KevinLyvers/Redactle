a, computer, monitor, is, an, output, device, that, displays, information, in, pictorial, or, textual, form, a, discrete, monitor, comprises, a, visual, display, support, electronics, power, supply, housing, electrical, connectors, and, external, user, controls, the, display, in, modern, monitors, is, typically, an, lcd, with, led, backlight, having, by, the, 2010s, replaced, ccfl, backlit, lcds, before, the, mid, 2000s, most, monitors, used, a, cathode, ray, tube, crt, as, the, image, output, technology, a, monitor, is, typically, connected, to, its, host, computer, via, displayport, hdmi, usb, c, dvi, or, vga, monitors, sometimes, use, other, proprietary, connectors, and, signals, to, connect, to, a, computer, which, is, less, common, originally, computer, monitors, were, used, for, data, processing, while, television, sets, were, used, for, video, from, the, 1980s, onward, computers, and, their, monitors, have, been, used, for, both, data, processing, and, video, while, televisions, have, implemented, some, computer, functionality, in, the, 2000s, the, typical, display, aspect, ratio, of, both, televisions, and, computer, monitors, changed, from, 4, 3, to, 16, 9, modern, computer, monitors, are, often, functionally, interchangeable, with, television, sets, and, vice, versa, as, most, computer, monitors, do, not, include, integrated, speakers, tv, tuners, or, remote, controls, external, components, such, as, a, dta, box, may, be, needed, to, use, a, computer, monitor, as, a, tv, set, early, electronic, computer, front, panels, were, fitted, with, an, array, of, light, bulbs, where, the, state, of, each, particular, bulb, would, indicate, the, on, off, state, of, a, particular, register, bit, inside, the, computer, this, allowed, the, engineers, operating, the, computer, to, monitor, the, internal, state, of, the, machine, so, this, panel, of, lights, came, to, be, known, as, the, monitor, as, early, monitors, were, only, capable, of, displaying, a, very, limited, amount, of, information, and, were, very, transient, they, were, rarely, considered, for, program, output, instead, a, line, printer, was, the, primary, output, device, while, the, monitor, was, limited, to, keeping, track, of, the, program, s, operation, computer, monitors, were, formerly, known, as, visual, display, units, vdu, particularly, in, british, english, this, term, mostly, fell, out, of, use, by, the, 1990s, multiple, technologies, have, been, used, for, computer, monitors, until, the, 21st, century, most, used, cathode, ray, tubes, but, they, have, largely, been, superseded, by, lcd, monitors, the, first, computer, monitors, used, cathode, ray, tubes, crts, prior, to, the, advent, of, home, computers, in, the, late, 1970s, it, was, common, for, a, video, display, terminal, vdt, using, a, crt, to, be, physically, integrated, with, a, keyboard, and, other, components, of, the, workstation, in, a, single, large, chassis, typically, limiting, them, to, emulation, of, a, paper, teletypewriter, thus, the, early, epithet, of, glass, tty, the, display, was, monochromatic, and, far, less, sharp, and, detailed, than, on, a, modern, monitor, necessitating, the, use, of, relatively, large, text, and, severely, limiting, the, amount, of, information, that, could, be, displayed, at, one, time, high, resolution, crt, displays, were, developed, for, specialized, military, industrial, and, scientific, applications, but, they, were, far, too, costly, for, general, use, wider, commercial, use, became, possible, after, the, release, of, a, slow, but, affordable, tektronix, 4010, terminal, in, 1972, some, of, the, earliest, home, computers, such, as, the, trs, 80, and, commodore, pet, were, limited, to, monochrome, crt, displays, but, color, display, capability, was, already, a, possible, feature, for, a, few, mos, 6500, series, based, machines, such, as, introduced, in, 1977, apple, ii, computer, or, atari, 2600, console, and, the, color, output, was, a, specialty, of, the, more, graphically, sophisticated, atari, 8, bit, computers, introduced, in, 1979, either, computer, could, be, connected, to, the, antenna, terminals, of, an, ordinary, color, tv, set, or, used, with, a, purpose, made, crt, color, monitor, for, optimum, resolution, and, color, quality, lagging, several, years, behind, in, 1981, ibm, introduced, the, color, graphics, adapter, which, could, display, four, colors, with, a, resolution, of, 320, 200, pixels, or, it, could, produce, 640, 200, pixels, with, two, colors, in, 1984, ibm, introduced, the, enhanced, graphics, adapter, which, was, capable, of, producing, 16, colors, and, had, a, resolution, of, 640, 350, by, the, end, of, the, 1980s, color, progressive, scan, crt, monitors, were, widely, available, and, increasingly, affordable, while, the, sharpest, prosumer, monitors, could, clearly, display, high, definition, video, against, the, backdrop, of, efforts, at, hdtv, standardization, from, the, 1970s, to, the, 1980s, failing, continuously, leaving, consumer, sdtvs, to, stagnate, increasingly, far, behind, the, capabilities, of, computer, crt, monitors, well, into, the, 2000s, during, the, following, decade, maximum, display, resolutions, gradually, increased, and, prices, continued, to, fall, as, crt, technology, remained, dominant, in, the, pc, monitor, market, into, the, new, millennium, partly, because, it, remained, cheaper, to, produce, crts, still, offer, color, grayscale, motion, and, latency, advantages, over, today, s, lcds, but, improvements, to, the, latter, have, made, them, much, less, obvious, the, dynamic, range, of, early, lcd, panels, was, very, poor, and, although, text, and, other, motionless, graphics, were, sharper, than, on, a, crt, an, lcd, characteristic, known, as, pixel, lag, caused, moving, graphics, to, appear, noticeably, smeared, and, blurry, there, are, multiple, technologies, that, have, been, used, to, implement, liquid, crystal, displays, lcd, throughout, the, 1990s, the, primary, use, of, lcd, technology, as, computer, monitors, was, in, laptops, where, the, lower, power, consumption, lighter, weight, and, smaller, physical, size, of, lcds, justified, the, higher, price, versus, a, crt, commonly, the, same, laptop, would, be, offered, with, an, assortment, of, display, options, at, increasing, price, points, active, or, passive, monochrome, passive, color, or, active, matrix, color, tft, as, volume, and, manufacturing, capability, have, improved, the, monochrome, and, passive, color, technologies, were, dropped, from, most, product, lines, tft, lcd, is, a, variant, of, lcd, which, is, now, the, dominant, technology, used, for, computer, monitors, the, first, standalone, lcds, appeared, in, the, mid, 1990s, selling, for, high, prices, as, prices, declined, they, became, more, popular, and, by, 1997, were, competing, with, crt, monitors, among, the, first, desktop, lcd, computer, monitors, were, the, eizo, flexscan, l66, in, the, mid, 1990s, the, sgi, 1600sw, apple, studio, display, and, the, viewsonic, vp140, in, 1998, in, 2003, lcds, outsold, crts, for, the, first, time, becoming, the, primary, technology, used, for, computer, monitors, the, physical, advantages, of, lcd, over, crt, monitors, are, that, lcds, are, lighter, smaller, and, consume, less, power, in, terms, of, performance, lcds, produce, less, or, no, flicker, reducing, eyestrain, sharper, image, at, native, resolution, and, better, checkerboard, contrast, on, the, other, hand, crt, monitors, have, superior, blacks, viewing, angles, and, response, time, can, use, arbitrary, lower, resolutions, without, aliasing, and, flicker, can, be, reduced, with, higher, refresh, rates, though, this, flicker, can, also, be, used, to, reduce, motion, blur, compared, to, less, flickery, displays, such, as, most, lcds, many, specialized, fields, such, as, vision, science, remain, dependent, on, crts, the, best, lcd, monitors, having, achieved, moderate, temporal, accuracy, and, so, can, be, used, only, if, their, poor, spatial, accuracy, is, unimportant, high, dynamic, range, hdr, has, been, implemented, into, high, end, lcd, monitors, to, improve, grayscale, accuracy, since, around, the, late, 2000s, widescreen, lcd, monitors, have, become, popular, in, part, due, to, television, series, motion, pictures, and, video, games, transitioning, to, widescreen, which, makes, squarer, monitors, unsuited, to, display, them, correctly, organic, light, emitting, diode, oled, monitors, provide, most, of, the, benefits, of, both, lcd, and, crt, monitors, with, few, of, their, drawbacks, though, much, like, plasma, panels, or, very, early, crts, they, suffer, from, burn, in, and, remain, very, expensive, the, performance, of, a, monitor, is, measured, by, the, following, parameters, on, two, dimensional, display, devices, such, as, computer, monitors, the, display, size, or, viewable, image, size, is, the, actual, amount, of, screen, space, that, is, available, to, display, a, picture, video, or, working, space, without, obstruction, from, the, bezel, or, other, aspects, of, the, unit, s, design, the, main, measurements, for, display, devices, are, width, height, total, area, and, the, diagonal, the, size, of, a, display, is, usually, given, by, manufacturers, diagonally, i, e, as, the, distance, between, two, opposite, screen, corners, this, method, of, measurement, is, inherited, from, the, method, used, for, the, first, generation, of, crt, television, when, picture, tubes, with, circular, faces, were, in, common, use, being, circular, it, was, the, external, diameter, of, the, glass, envelope, that, described, their, size, since, these, circular, tubes, were, used, to, display, rectangular, images, the, diagonal, measurement, of, the, rectangular, image, was, smaller, than, the, diameter, of, the, tube, s, face, due, to, the, thickness, of, the, glass, this, method, continued, even, when, cathode, ray, tubes, were, manufactured, as, rounded, rectangles, it, had, the, advantage, of, being, a, single, number, specifying, the, size, and, was, not, confusing, when, the, aspect, ratio, was, universally, 4, 3, with, the, introduction, of, flat, panel, technology, the, diagonal, measurement, became, the, actual, diagonal, of, the, visible, display, this, meant, that, an, eighteen, inch, lcd, had, a, larger, viewable, area, than, an, eighteen, inch, cathode, ray, tube, estimation, of, monitor, size, by, the, distance, between, opposite, corners, does, not, take, into, account, the, display, aspect, ratio, so, that, for, example, a, 16, 9, 21, inch, 53, cm, widescreen, display, has, less, area, than, a, 21, inch, 53, cm, 4, 3, screen, the, 4, 3, screen, has, dimensions, of, 16, 8, in, 12, 6, in, 43, cm, 32, cm, and, an, area, 211, sq, in, 1, 360, cm, 2, while, the, widescreen, is, 18, 3, in, 10, 3, in, 46, cm, 26, cm, 188, sq, in, 1, 210, cm, 2, until, about, 2003, most, computer, monitors, had, a, 4, 3, aspect, ratio, and, some, had, 5, 4, between, 2003, and, 2006, monitors, with, 16, 9, and, mostly, 16, 10, 8, 5, aspect, ratios, became, commonly, available, first, in, laptops, and, later, also, in, standalone, monitors, reasons, for, this, transition, included, productive, uses, i, e, field, of, view, in, video, games, and, movie, viewing, such, as, the, word, processor, display, of, two, standard, letter, pages, side, by, side, as, well, as, cad, displays, of, large, size, drawings, and, application, menus, at, the, same, time, in, 2008, 16, 10, became, the, most, common, sold, aspect, ratio, for, lcd, monitors, and, the, same, year, 16, 10, was, the, mainstream, standard, for, laptops, and, notebook, computers, in, 2010, the, computer, industry, started, to, move, over, from, 16, 10, to, 16, 9, because, 16, 9, was, chosen, to, be, the, standard, high, definition, television, display, size, and, because, they, were, cheaper, to, manufacture, in, 2011, non, widescreen, displays, with, 4, 3, aspect, ratios, were, only, being, manufactured, in, small, quantities, according, to, samsung, this, was, because, the, demand, for, the, old, square, monitors, has, decreased, rapidly, over, the, last, couple, of, years, and, i, predict, that, by, the, end, of, 2011, production, on, all, 4, 3, or, similar, panels, will, be, halted, due, to, a, lack, of, demand, the, resolution, for, computer, monitors, has, increased, over, time, from, 280, 192, during, the, late, 1970s, to, 1024, 768, during, the, late, 1990s, since, 2009, the, most, commonly, sold, resolution, for, computer, monitors, is, 1920, 1080, shared, with, the, 1080p, of, hdtv, before, 2013, mass, market, lcd, monitors, were, limited, to, 2560, 1600, at, 30, in, 76, cm, excluding, niche, professional, monitors, by, 2015, most, major, display, manufacturers, had, released, 3840, 2160, 4k, uhd, displays, and, the, first, 7680, 4320, 8k, monitors, had, begun, shipping, every, rgb, monitor, has, its, own, color, gamut, bounded, in, chromaticity, by, a, color, triangle, some, of, these, triangles, are, smaller, than, the, srgb, triangle, some, are, larger, colors, are, typically, encoded, by, 8, bits, per, primary, color, the, rgb, value, represents, red, but, slightly, different, colors, in, different, color, spaces, such, as, adobe, rgb, and, srgb, displaying, srgb, encoded, data, on, wide, gamut, devices, can, give, an, unrealistic, result, the, gamut, is, a, property, of, the, monitor, the, image, color, space, can, be, forwarded, as, exif, metadata, in, the, picture, as, long, as, the, monitor, gamut, is, wider, than, the, color, space, gamut, correct, display, is, possible, if, the, monitor, is, calibrated, a, picture, that, uses, colors, that, are, outside, the, srgb, color, space, will, display, on, an, srgb, color, space, monitor, with, limitations, still, today, many, monitors, that, can, display, the, srgb, color, space, are, not, factory, nor, user, calibrated, to, display, it, correctly, color, management, is, needed, both, in, electronic, publishing, via, the, internet, for, display, in, browsers, and, in, desktop, publishing, targeted, to, print, most, modern, monitors, will, switch, to, a, power, saving, mode, if, no, video, input, signal, is, received, this, allows, modern, operating, systems, to, turn, off, a, monitor, after, a, specified, period, of, inactivity, this, also, extends, the, monitor, s, service, life, some, monitors, will, also, switch, themselves, off, after, a, time, period, on, standby, most, modern, laptops, provide, a, method, of, screen, dimming, after, periods, of, inactivity, or, when, the, battery, is, in, use, this, extends, battery, life, and, reduces, wear, most, modern, monitors, have, two, different, indicator, light, colors, wherein, if, video, input, signal, was, detected, the, indicator, light, is, green, and, when, the, monitor, is, in, power, saving, mode, the, screen, is, black, and, the, indicator, light, is, orange, some, monitors, have, different, indicator, light, colors, and, some, monitors, have, a, blinking, indicator, light, when, in, power, saving, mode, many, monitors, have, other, accessories, or, connections, for, them, integrated, this, places, standard, ports, within, easy, reach, and, eliminates, the, need, for, another, separate, hub, camera, microphone, or, set, of, speakers, these, monitors, have, advanced, microprocessors, which, contain, codec, information, windows, interface, drivers, and, other, small, software, which, help, in, proper, functioning, of, these, functions, monitors, that, feature, an, aspect, ratio, greater, than, 2, 1, for, instance, 21, 9, or, 32, 9, as, opposed, to, the, more, common, 16, 9, which, resolves, to, 1, 7, 7, 1, monitors, with, an, aspect, ratio, greater, than, 3, 1, are, marketed, as, super, ultrawide, monitors, these, are, typically, massive, curved, screens, intended, to, replace, a, multi, monitor, deployment, these, monitors, use, touching, of, the, screen, as, an, input, method, items, can, be, selected, or, moved, with, a, finger, and, finger, gestures, may, be, used, to, convey, commands, the, screen, will, need, frequent, cleaning, due, to, image, degradation, from, fingerprints, some, displays, especially, newer, flat, panel, monitors, replace, the, traditional, anti, glare, matte, finish, with, a, glossy, one, this, increases, color, saturation, and, sharpness, but, reflections, from, lights, and, windows, are, more, visible, anti, reflective, coatings, are, sometimes, applied, to, help, reduce, reflections, although, this, only, partly, mitigates, the, problem, most, often, using, nominally, flat, panel, display, technology, such, as, lcd, or, oled, a, concave, rather, than, convex, curve, is, imparted, reducing, geometric, distortion, especially, in, extremely, large, and, wide, seamless, desktop, monitors, intended, for, close, viewing, range, newer, monitors, are, able, to, display, a, different, image, for, each, eye, often, with, the, help, of, special, glasses, and, polarizers, giving, the, perception, of, depth, an, autostereoscopic, screen, can, generate, 3d, images, without, headgear, features, for, medical, using, or, for, outdoor, placement, narrow, viewing, angle, screens, are, used, in, some, security, conscious, applications, integrated, screen, calibration, tools, screen, hoods, signal, transmitters, protective, screens, a, combination, of, a, monitor, with, a, graphics, tablet, such, devices, are, typically, unresponsive, to, touch, without, the, use, of, one, or, more, special, tools, pressure, newer, models, however, are, now, able, to, detect, touch, from, any, pressure, and, often, have, the, ability, to, detect, tool, tilt, and, rotation, as, well, touch, and, tablet, sensors, are, often, used, on, sample, and, hold, displays, such, as, lcds, to, substitute, for, the, light, pen, which, can, only, work, on, crts, the, option, for, using, the, display, as, a, reference, monitor, these, calibration, features, can, give, an, advanced, color, management, control, for, take, a, near, perfect, image, option, for, professional, lcd, monitors, inherent, to, oled, crt, professional, feature, with, mainstream, tendency, near, to, mainstream, professional, feature, advanced, hardware, driver, for, backlit, modules, with, local, zones, of, uniformity, correction, computer, monitors, are, provided, with, a, variety, of, methods, for, mounting, them, depending, on, the, application, and, environment, a, desktop, monitor, is, typically, provided, with, a, stand, from, the, manufacturer, which, lifts, the, monitor, up, to, a, more, ergonomic, viewing, height, the, stand, may, be, attached, to, the, monitor, using, a, proprietary, method, or, may, use, or, be, adaptable, to, a, vesa, mount, a, vesa, standard, mount, allows, the, monitor, to, be, used, with, more, after, market, stands, if, the, original, stand, is, removed, stands, may, be, fixed, or, offer, a, variety, of, features, such, as, height, adjustment, horizontal, swivel, and, landscape, or, portrait, screen, orientation, the, flat, display, mounting, interface, fdmi, also, known, as, vesa, mounting, interface, standard, mis, or, colloquially, as, a, vesa, mount, is, a, family, of, standards, defined, by, the, video, electronics, standards, association, for, mounting, flat, panel, displays, to, stands, or, wall, mounts, it, is, implemented, on, most, modern, flat, panel, monitors, and, tvs, for, computer, monitors, the, vesa, mount, typically, consists, of, four, threaded, holes, on, the, rear, of, the, display, that, will, mate, with, an, adapter, bracket, rack, mount, computer, monitors, are, available, in, two, styles, and, are, intended, to, be, mounted, into, a, 19, inch, rack, a, fixed, rack, mount, monitor, is, mounted, directly, to, the, rack, with, the, flat, panel, or, crt, visible, at, all, times, the, height, of, the, unit, is, measured, in, rack, units, ru, and, 8u, or, 9u, are, most, common, to, fit, 17, inch, or, 19, inch, screens, the, front, sides, of, the, unit, are, provided, with, flanges, to, mount, to, the, rack, providing, appropriately, spaced, holes, or, slots, for, the, rack, mounting, screws, a, 19, inch, diagonal, screen, is, the, largest, size, that, will, fit, within, the, rails, of, a, 19, inch, rack, larger, flat, panels, may, be, accommodated, but, are, mount, on, rack, and, extend, forward, of, the, rack, there, are, smaller, display, units, typically, used, in, broadcast, environments, which, fit, multiple, smaller, screens, side, by, side, into, one, rack, mount, a, stowable, rack, mount, monitor, is, 1u, 2u, or, 3u, high, and, is, mounted, on, rack, slides, allowing, the, display, to, be, folded, down, and, the, unit, slid, into, the, rack, for, storage, as, a, drawer, the, flat, display, is, visible, only, when, pulled, out, of, the, rack, and, deployed, these, units, may, include, only, a, display, or, may, be, equipped, with, a, keyboard, creating, a, kvm, keyboard, video, monitor, most, common, are, systems, with, a, single, lcd, but, there, are, systems, providing, two, or, three, displays, in, a, single, rack, mount, system, a, panel, mount, computer, monitor, is, intended, for, mounting, into, a, flat, surface, with, the, front, of, the, display, unit, protruding, just, slightly, they, may, also, be, mounted, to, the, rear, of, the, panel, a, flange, is, provided, around, the, screen, sides, top, and, bottom, to, allow, mounting, this, contrasts, with, a, rack, mount, display, where, the, flanges, are, only, on, the, sides, the, flanges, will, be, provided, with, holes, for, thru, bolts, or, may, have, studs, welded, to, the, rear, surface, to, secure, the, unit, in, the, hole, in, the, panel, often, a, gasket, is, provided, to, provide, a, water, tight, seal, to, the, panel, and, the, front, of, the, screen, will, be, sealed, to, the, back, of, the, front, panel, to, prevent, water, and, dirt, contamination, an, open, frame, monitor, provides, the, display, and, enough, supporting, structure, to, hold, associated, electronics, and, to, minimally, support, the, display, provision, will, be, made, for, attaching, the, unit, to, some, external, structure, for, support, and, protection, open, frame, monitors, are, intended, to, be, built, into, some, other, piece, of, equipment, providing, its, own, case, an, arcade, video, game, would, be, a, good, example, with, the, display, mounted, inside, the, cabinet, there, is, usually, an, open, frame, display, inside, all, end, use, displays, with, the, end, use, display, simply, providing, an, attractive, protective, enclosure, some, rack, mount, monitor, manufacturers, will, purchase, desktop, displays, take, them, apart, and, discard, the, outer, plastic, parts, keeping, the, inner, open, frame, display, for, inclusion, into, their, product, according, to, an, nsa, document, leaked, to, der, spiegel, the, nsa, sometimes, swaps, the, monitor, cables, on, targeted, computers, with, a, bugged, monitor, cable, to, allow, the, nsa, to, remotely, see, what, is, being, displayed, on, the, targeted, computer, monitor, van, eck, phreaking, is, the, process, of, remotely, displaying, the, contents, of, a, crt, or, lcd, by, detecting, its, electromagnetic, emissions, it, is, named, after, dutch, computer, researcher, wim, van, eck, who, in, 1985, published, the, first, paper, on, it, including, proof, of, concept, phreaking, more, generally, is, the, process, of, exploiting, telephone, networks
