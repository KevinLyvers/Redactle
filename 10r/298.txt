referred, to, the, location, of, one, s, duty, in, its, adjective, form, the, term, office, may, refer, to, business, related, tasks, in, law, a, company, or, organization, has, offices, in, any, place, where, it, has, an, official, presence, even, if, that, presence, consists, of, a, storage, silo, for, example, instead, of, a, more, traditional, establishment, with, a, desk, and, chair, an, office, is, also, an, architectural, and, design, phenomenon, including, small, offices, such, as, a, bench, in, the, corner, of, a, small, business, or, a, room, in, someone, s, home, see, small, office, home, office, entire, floors, of, buildings, and, massive, buildings, dedicated, entirely, to, one, company, in, modern, terms, an, office, is, usually, the, location, where, white, collar, workers, carry, out, their, functions, in, classical, antiquity, offices, were, often, part, of, a, palace, complex, or, a, large, temple, in, the, high, middle, ages, 1000, 1300, the, medieval, chancery, acted, as, a, sort, of, office, serving, as, the, space, where, records, and, laws, were, stored, and, copied, with, the, growth, of, large, complex, organizations, in, the, 18th, century, the, first, purpose, built, office, spaces, were, constructed, as, the, industrial, revolution, intensified, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, industries, of, banking, rail, insurance, retail, petroleum, and, telegraphy, grew, dramatically, requiring, many, clerks, as, a, result, more, office, space, was, assigned, to, house, their, activities, the, time, and, motion, study, pioneered, in, manufacturing, by, f, w, taylor, 1856, 1915, led, to, the, modern, efficiency, desk, of, 1915, its, flat, top, with, drawers, below, was, designed, to, allow, managers, an, easy, view, of, their, workers, by, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, it, became, apparent, that, an, efficient, office, required, additional, control, over, privacy, and, gradually, the, cubicle, system, evolved, the, word, office, stems, from, the, latin, officium, and, its, equivalents, in, various, romance, languages, an, officium, was, not, necessarily, a, place, but, often, referred, instead, to, human, staff, members, of, an, organization, or, even, the, abstract, notion, of, a, formal, position, like, a, magistrate, the, elaborate, roman, bureaucracy, would, not, be, equaled, for, centuries, in, the, west, after, the, fall, of, rome, with, areas, partially, reverting, to, illiteracy, further, east, the, byzantine, empire, and, varying, islamic, caliphates, preserved, a, more, sophisticated, administrative, culture, offices, in, classical, antiquity, were, often, part, of, a, palace, complex, or, a, large, temple, there, was, often, a, room, where, scrolls, were, kept, and, scribes, did, their, work, ancient, texts, mentioning, the, work, of, scribes, allude, to, the, existence, of, such, offices, these, rooms, are, sometimes, called, libraries, by, some, archaeologists, because, of, scrolls, association, with, literature, they, were, however, closer, to, modern, offices, because, the, scrolls, were, meant, for, record, keeping, and, other, management, functions, not, for, poetry, or, works, of, fiction, the, high, middle, ages, 1000, 1300, saw, the, rise, of, the, medieval, chancery, which, was, the, place, where, most, government, letters, were, written, and, laws, were, copied, within, a, kingdom, the, rooms, of, the, chancery, often, had, walls, full, of, pigeonholes, constructed, to, hold, rolled, up, pieces, of, parchment, for, safekeeping, or, ready, reference, this, kind, of, structure, was, a, precursor, to, the, modern, bookshelf, the, introduction, of, the, printing, press, during, the, renaissance, did, not, impact, the, setup, and, function, of, these, government, offices, significantly, medieval, paintings, and, tapestries, often, show, people, in, their, private, offices, handling, record, keeping, books, or, writing, on, scrolls, of, parchment, before, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, and, its, wider, distribution, there, was, often, no, clear, cultural, distinction, between, a, private, office, and, a, private, library, books, were, both, read, and, written, at, the, same, desk, or, table, as, were, personal, and, professional, accounts, and, letters, during, the, 13th, century, the, english, word, office, first, began, to, appear, when, referring, to, a, position, involving, specific, professional, duties, for, example, the, office, of, the, geoffrey, chaucer, appears, to, have, first, used, the, word, in, 1395, to, mean, a, place, where, business, is, transacted, in, the, canterbury, tales, as, mercantilism, became, the, dominant, economic, theory, of, the, renaissance, merchants, tended, to, conduct, their, business, in, buildings, that, also, sometimes, housed, people, doing, retail, sales, warehousing, and, clerical, work, during, the, 15th, century, the, population, density, in, many, cities, reached, a, point, where, merchants, began, to, use, stand, alone, buildings, to, conduct, their, business, a, distinction, began, to, develop, between, religious, administrative, military, and, commercial, uses, for, buildings, the, first, purpose, built, office, spaces, were, constructed, in, the, 18th, century, to, suit, the, needs, of, large, and, growing, organizations, such, as, the, royal, navy, and, the, east, india, company, the, old, admiralty, ripley, building, was, built, in, 1726, and, was, the, first, purpose, built, office, building, in, great, britain, as, well, as, offices, the, building, housed, a, board, room, and, apartments, for, the, lords, of, the, admiralty, in, the, 1770s, many, scattered, offices, for, the, royal, navy, were, gathered, into, somerset, house, the, first, block, purpose, built, for, office, work, the, east, india, house, was, built, in, 1729, on, leadenhall, street, as, the, headquarters, from, which, the, east, india, company, administered, its, indian, colonial, possessions, the, company, developed, a, very, complex, bureaucracy, for, the, task, necessitating, thousands, of, office, employees, to, process, the, required, paperwork, the, company, recognized, the, benefits, of, centralized, administration, and, required, that, all, workers, sign, in, and, out, at, the, central, office, each, day, as, the, industrial, revolution, intensified, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, industries, of, banking, rail, insurance, retail, petroleum, and, telegraphy, dramatically, grew, in, size, and, complexity, increasingly, large, number, of, clerks, were, needed, to, handle, order, processing, accounting, and, document, filing, and, these, clerks, needed, to, be, housed, in, increasingly, specialized, spaces, most, of, the, desks, of, the, era, were, top, heavy, and, had, a, cubicle, like, appearance, with, paper, storage, bins, extending, above, the, desk, work, area, offering, workers, some, degree, of, privacy, the, relatively, high, price, of, land, in, the, central, core, of, cities, led, to, the, first, multi, story, buildings, which, were, limited, to, about, 10, stories, until, the, use, of, iron, and, steel, allowed, for, higher, structures, the, first, purpose, built, office, block, was, the, brunswick, building, built, in, liverpool, in, 1841, the, invention, of, the, safety, elevator, in, 1852, by, elisha, otis, enabled, the, rapid, upward, escalation, of, buildings, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, larger, office, buildings, frequently, contained, large, glass, atriums, to, allow, light, into, the, complex, and, improve, air, circulation, by, 1906, sears, roebuck, and, co, had, opened, their, headquarters, operation, in, a, 3, 000, 000, square, foot, 280, 000, m, 2, building, in, chicago, at, the, time, the, largest, building, in, the, world, the, time, and, motion, study, pioneered, in, manufacturing, by, f, w, taylor, and, later, applied, to, the, office, environment, by, frank, and, lillian, gilbreth, led, to, the, idea, that, managers, needed, to, play, an, active, role, in, directing, the, work, of, subordinates, to, increase, the, efficiency, of, the, workplace, f, w, taylor, advocated, the, use, of, large, open, floor, plans, and, desks, that, faced, supervisors, as, a, result, in, 1915, the, equitable, life, insurance, company, in, new, york, city, introduced, the, modern, efficiency, desk, with, a, flat, top, and, drawers, below, designed, to, allow, managers, an, easy, view, of, the, workers, this, led, to, a, demand, for, large, square, footage, per, floor, in, buildings, and, a, return, to, the, open, spaces, that, were, seen, in, pre, industrial, revolution, buildings, however, by, the, midpoint, of, the, 20th, century, it, became, apparent, that, an, efficient, office, required, more, privacy, in, order, to, combat, tedium, increase, productivity, and, encourage, creativity, in, 1964, the, herman, miller, office, equipment, company, contracted, robert, propst, a, prolific, industrial, designer, propst, came, up, with, the, concept, of, the, action, office, which, later, evolved, into, the, cubicle, office, furniture, system, offices, in, japan, have, developed, unique, characteristics, partly, as, a, result, of, the, country, s, unique, business, culture, japanese, offices, tend, to, follow, open, plan, layouts, in, an, island, style, arrangement, which, promotes, teamwork, and, top, down, management, they, also, use, uchi, awase, informal, meetings, and, ringi, sho, consensus, systems, to, encourage, input, on, policies, from, as, many, groups, throughout, the, office, as, possible, the, main, purpose, of, an, office, environment, is, to, support, its, occupants, in, performing, their, jobs, preferably, at, minimum, cost, and, with, maximum, satisfaction, different, people, performing, different, tasks, will, require, different, office, spaces, or, spaces, that, can, handle, a, variety, of, uses, to, aid, decision, making, in, workplace, and, office, design, one, can, distinguish, three, different, types, of, office, spaces, workspaces, meeting, spaces, and, support, spaces, for, new, or, developing, businesses, remote, satellite, offices, and, project, rooms, or, serviced, offices, can, provide, a, simple, solution, and, provide, all, of, the, former, types, of, space, workspaces, in,

might, see, tens, or, hundreds, of, people, working, in, the, same, room, open, plan, offices, put, multiple, workers, together, in, the, same, space, and, some, studies, have, shown, that, they, can, improve, short, term, productivity, i, e, within, a, single, software, project, at, the, same, time, the, loss, of, privacy, and, security, can, increase, the, incidence, of, theft, and, loss, of, company, secrets, a, type, of, compromise, between, open, plan, and, individual, rooms, is, provided, by, the, cubicle, desk, possibly, made, most, famous, by, the, dilbert, cartoon, series, which, solves, visual, privacy, to, some, extent, but, often, fails, on, acoustic, separation, and, security, most, cubicles, also, require, the, occupant, to, sit, with, their, back, towards, anyone, who, might, be, approaching, workers, in, walled, offices, typically, try, to, position, their, normal, work, seats, and, desks, so, that, they, can, see, someone, entering, and, if, that, goal, is, not, feasible, some, install, tiny, mirrors, on, things, such, as, computer, monitors, according, to, research, open, plan, offices, are, associated, with, increased, stress, a, rise, in, electronic,

almost, any, location, and, in, almost, any, building, some, modern, requirements, for, offices, make, this, more, difficult, these, requirements, can, be, legal, such, as, sufficient, light, levels, or, technical, such, as, requirements, for, computer, networking, other, needs, such, as, security, and, layout, flexibility, have, prompted, the, creation, of, special, buildings, which, are, dedicated, primarily, for, use, as, offices, an, office, building, also, known, as, an, office, block, or, business, center, is, a, form, of, commercial, building, which, contains, spaces, mainly, designed, to, be, used, for, offices, the, primary, purpose, of, an, office, building, is, to, provide, a, workplace, and, working, environment, primarily, for, administrative, and, managerial, workers, these, workers, usually, occupy, set, areas, within, the, office, building, and, usually, are, provided, with, desks, pcs, and, other, equipment, they, may, need, within, their, areas, an, office, building, may, be, divided, into, sections, for, different, companies, or, it, may, be, dedicated, to, one, company, in, either, case, each, company, will, typically, have, a, reception, area, one, or, several, meeting, rooms, singular, or, open, plan, offices, and, service, rooms, such, as, restrooms, many, office, buildings, also, have, kitchen, facilities, and, a, staff, room, where,

rental, rates, for, office, and, retail, space, are, typically, quoted, in, terms, of, cost, per, floor, area, time, usually, cost, per, floor, area, per, year, or, month, for, example, the, rate, for, a, particular, property, may, be, 29, per, square, foot, per, year, 29, sq, ft, yr, or, 290, per, square, meter, per, year, 290, m, 2, yr, in, many, countries, rent, is, typically, paid, monthly, even, if, usually, discussed, in, terms, of, years, examples, in, a, gross, lease, the, rate, quoted, is, an, all, inclusive, rate, the, renter, pays, a, set, amount, of, rent, per, time, and, the, landlord, is, responsible, for, all, other, expenses, including, payments, for, utilities, taxes, insurance, maintenance, and, repairs, the, triple, net, lease, is, one, in, which, the, tenant, is, liable, for, a, share, of, various, expenses, such, as, property, taxes, insurance, maintenance, utilities, climate, control, repairs, janitorial, services, and, landscaping, office, rents, in, the, united, states, are, still, recovering, from, the, high, vacancy, rates, that, occurred, in, the, wake, of, the, 2008, depression, the, building, owners, and, managers, association, boma, classifies, office, space, into, three, categories, class, a, class, b, and, class, c, according, to, boma, class, a, office, buildings, have, the, most, prestigious, buildings, competing, for, premier, office, users, with, rents, above, average, for, the, area, boma, states, that, class, a, facilities, have, high, quality, standard, finishes, state, of, the, art, systems, exceptional, accessibility, and, a, definite, market, presence, boma, describes, class, b, office, buildings, as, those, that, compete, for, a, wide, range, of, users, with, rents, in, the, average, range, for, the, area, boma, states, that, class, b, buildings, have, adequate, systems, and, finishes, that, are, fair, to, good, for, the, area, but, that, the, buildings, do, not, compete, at, the, same, price, rates, as, class, a, buildings, according, to, boma, class, c, buildings, are, aimed, towards, tenants, requiring, functional, space, at, rents, below, the, average, for, the, area, the, lack, of, specifics, allows, considerable, room, for, pushing, the, boundaries, of, these, boma, categories, oftentimes, they, are, further, modified, by, adding, the, plus, or, minus, sign, to, create, subclasses, such, as, class, a, or, class, b
