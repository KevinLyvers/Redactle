an, optical, disc, is, a, flat, usually, disc, shaped, object, that, stores, information, in, the, form, of, physical, variations, on, its, surface, that, can, be, read, with, the, aid, of, a, beam, of, light, optical, discs, can, be, reflective, where, the, light, source, and, detector, are, on, the, same, side, of, the, disc, or, transmissive, where, light, shines, through, the, disc, to, be, detected, on, the, other, side, optical, discs, can, store, analog, information, e, g, laserdisc, digital, information, e, g, dvd, or, store, both, on, the, same, disc, e, g, cd, video, their, main, uses, are, the, distribution, of, media, and, data, and, long, term, archival, the, encoding, material, sits, atop, a, thicker, substrate, usually, polycarbonate, that, makes, up, the, bulk, of, the, disc, and, forms, a, dust, defocusing, layer, the, encoding, pattern, follows, a, continuous, spiral, path, covering, the, entire, disc, surface, and, extending, from, the, innermost, track, to, the, outermost, track, the, data, are, stored, on, the, disc, with, a, laser, or, stamping, machine, and, can, be, accessed, when, the, data, path, is, illuminated, with, a, laser, diode, in, an, optical, disc, drive, that, spins, the, disc, at, speeds, of, about, 200, to, 4, 000, rpm, or, more, depending, on, the, drive, type, disc, format, and, the, distance, of, the, read, head, from, the, center, of, the, disc, outer, tracks, are, read, at, a, higher, data, speed, due, to, higher, linear, velocities, at, the, same, angular, velocities, most, optical, discs, exhibit, a, characteristic, iridescence, as, a, result, of, the, diffraction, grating, formed, by, their, grooves, this, side, of, the, disc, contains, the, actual, data, and, is, typically, coated, with, a, transparent, material, usually, lacquer, the, reverse, side, of, an, optical, disc, usually, has, a, printed, label, sometimes, made, of, paper, but, often, printed, or, stamped, onto, the, disc, itself, unlike, the, 3, 1, 2, inch, floppy, disk, most, optical, discs, do, not, have, an, integrated, protective, casing, and, are, therefore, susceptible, to, data, transfer, problems, due, to, scratches, fingerprints, and, other, environmental, problems, blu, rays, have, a, coating, called, durabis, that, mitigates, these, problems, optical, discs, are, usually, between, 7, 6, and, 30, cm, 3, 0, and, 11, 8, in, in, diameter, with, 12, cm, 4, 7, in, being, the, most, common, size, the, so, called, program, area, that, contains, the, data, commonly, starts, 25, millimetres, away, from, the, center, point, a, typical, disc, is, about, 1, 2, mm, 0, 047, in, thick, while, the, track, pitch, distance, from, the, center, of, one, track, to, the, center, of, the, next, ranges, from, 1, 6, m, for, cds, to, 320, nm, for, blu, ray, discs, an, optical, disc, is, designed, to, support, one, of, three, recording, types, read, only, e, g, cd, and, cd, rom, recordable, write, once, e, g, cd, r, or, re, recordable, rewritable, e, g, cd, rw, write, once, optical, discs, commonly, have, an, organic, dye, may, also, be, a, phthalocyanine, azo, dye, mainly, used, by, verbatim, or, an, oxonol, dye, used, by, fujifilm, recording, layer, between, the, substrate, and, the, reflective, layer, rewritable, discs, typically, contain, an, alloy, recording, layer, composed, of, a, phase, change, material, most, often, aginsbte, an, alloy, of, silver, indium, antimony, and, tellurium, azo, dyes, were, introduced, in, 1996, and, phthalocyanine, only, began, to, see, wide, use, in, 2002, the, type, of, dye, and, the, material, used, on, the, reflective, layer, on, an, optical, disc, may, be, determined, by, shining, a, light, through, the, disc, as, different, dye, and, material, combinations, have, different, colors, blu, ray, disc, recordable, discs, do, not, usually, use, an, organic, dye, recording, layer, instead, using, an, inorganic, recording, layer, those, that, do, are, known, as, low, to, high, lth, discs, and, can, be, made, in, existing, cd, and, dvd, production, lines, but, are, of, lower, quality, than, traditional, blu, ray, recordable, discs, file, systems, specifically, created, for, optical, discs, are, iso9660, and, the, universal, disk, format, udf, iso9660, can, be, extended, using, the, joliet, extension, to, store, longer, file, names, than, standalone, iso9660, the, rock, ridge, extension, can, store, even, longer, file, names, and, unix, linux, style, file, permissions, but, is, not, recognized, by, windows, and, by, dvd, players, and, similar, devices, that, can, read, data, discs, for, cross, platform, compatibility, multiple, file, systems, can, co, exist, on, one, disc, and, reference, the, same, files, optical, discs, are, often, stored, in, special, cases, sometimes, called, jewel, cases, and, are, most, commonly, used, for, digital, preservation, storing, music, e, g, for, use, in, a, cd, player, video, e, g, for, use, in, a, blu, ray, player, or, data, and, programs, for, personal, computers, pc, as, well, as, offline, hard, copy, data, distribution, due, to, lower, per, unit, prices, than, other, types, of, media, the, optical, storage, technology, association, osta, promoted, standardized, optical, storage, formats, libraries, and, archives, enact, optical, media, preservation, procedures, to, ensure, continued, usability, in, the, computer, s, optical, disc, drive, or, corresponding, disc, player, file, operations, of, traditional, mass, storage, devices, such, as, flash, drives, memory, cards, and, hard, drives, can, be, simulated, using, a, udf, live, file, system, for, computer, data, backup, and, physical, data, transfer, optical, discs, such, as, cds, and, dvds, are, gradually, being, replaced, with, faster, smaller, solid, state, devices, especially, the, usb, flash, drive, this, trend, is, expected, to, continue, as, usb, flash, drives, continue, to, increase, in, capacity, and, drop, in, price, additionally, music, movies, games, software, and, tv, shows, purchased, shared, or, streamed, over, the, internet, has, significantly, reduced, the, number, of, audio, cds, video, dvds, and, blu, ray, discs, sold, annually, however, audio, cds, and, blu, rays, are, still, preferred, and, bought, by, some, as, a, way, of, supporting, their, favorite, works, while, getting, something, tangible, in, return, and, also, since, audio, cds, alongside, vinyl, records, and, cassette, tapes, contain, uncompressed, audio, without, the, artifacts, introduced, by, lossy, compression, algorithms, like, mp3, and, blu, rays, offer, better, image, and, sound, quality, than, streaming, media, without, visible, compression, artifacts, due, to, higher, bitrates, and, more, available, storage, space, however, blu, rays, may, sometimes, be, torrented, over, the, internet, but, torrenting, may, not, be, an, option, for, some, due, to, restrictions, put, in, place, by, isps, on, legal, or, copyright, grounds, low, download, speeds, or, not, having, enough, available, storage, space, since, the, content, may, weigh, up, to, several, dozen, gigabytes, blu, rays, may, be, the, only, option, for, those, looking, to, play, large, games, without, having, to, download, them, over, an, unreliable, or, slow, internet, connection, which, is, the, reason, why, they, are, still, as, of, 2020, widely, used, by, gaming, consoles, like, the, playstation, 4, and, xbox, one, x, as, of, 2020, it, is, unusual, for, pc, games, to, be, available, in, a, physical, format, like, blu, ray, discs, should, not, have, any, stickers, and, should, not, be, stored, together, with, paper, papers, must, be, removed, from, the, jewel, case, before, storage, discs, should, be, handled, by, the, edges, to, prevent, scratching, with, the, thumb, on, the, inner, edge, of, the, disc, the, iso, standard, 18938, 2014, is, about, best, optical, disc, handling, techniques, optical, disc, cleaning, should, never, be, done, in, a, circular, pattern, to, avoid, concentric, cirles, from, forming, on, the, disc, improper, cleaning, can, scratch, the, disc, recordable, discs, should, not, be, exposed, to, light, for, extended, periods, of, time, optical, discs, should, be, stored, in, dry, and, cool, conditions, to, increase, longevity, with, temperatures, between, 10, and, 23, c, never, exceeding, 32, c, and, with, humidity, never, falling, below, 10, with, recommended, storage, at, 20, to, 50, of, humidity, without, fluctuations, of, more, than, 10, although, optical, discs, are, more, durable, than, earlier, audio, visual, and, data, storage, formats, they, are, susceptible, to, environmental, and, daily, use, damage, if, handled, improperly, optical, discs, are, not, prone, to, uncontrollable, catastrophic, failures, such, as, head, crashes, power, surges, or, exposure, to, water, like, hard, disk, drives, and, flash, storage, since, optical, drives, storage, controllers, are, not, tied, to, optical, discs, themselves, like, with, hard, disk, drives, and, flash, memory, controllers, and, a, disc, is, usually, recoverable, from, a, defective, optical, drive, by, pushing, an, unsharp, needle, into, the, emergency, ejection, pinhole, and, has, no, point, of, immediate, water, ingress, and, no, integrated, circuitry, as, the, media, itself, only, is, accessed, through, a, laser, beam, no, internal, control, circuitry, it, can, not, contain, malicious, hardware, such, as, so, called, rubber, duckies, or, usb, killers, malware, is, unable, to, spread, over, factory, pressed, media, finalized, media, or, rom, read, only, memory, drive, types, whose, lasers, lack, the, strength, to, write, data, malware, is, conventionally, programmed, to, detect, and, spread, over, traditional, mass, storage, devices, such, as, flash, drives, external, solid, state, drives, and, hard, disk, drives, the, first, recorded, historical, use, of, an, optical, disc, was, in, 1884, when, alexander, graham, bell, chichester, bell, and, charles, sumner, tainter, recorded, sound, on, a, glass, disc, using, a, beam, of, light, optophonie, is, a, very, early, 1931, example, of, a, recording, device, using, light, for, both, recording, and, playing, back, sound, signals, on, a, transparent, photograph, an, early, analogue, optical, disc, system, existed, in, 1935, used, on, welte, s, lichttonorgel, sampling, organ, an, early, analog, optical, disc, used, for, video, recording, was, invented, by, david, paul, gregg, in, 1958, and, patented, in, the, us, in, 1961, and, 1969, this, form, of, optical, disc, was, a, very, early, form, of, the, dvd, u, s, patent, 3, 430, 966, it, is, of, special, interest, that, u, s, patent, 4, 893, 297, filed, 1989, issued, 1990, generated, royalty, income, for, pioneer, corporation, s, dva, until, 2007, then, encompassing, the, cd, dvd, and, blu, ray, systems, in, the, early, 1960s, the, music, corporation, of, america, bought, gregg, s, patents, and, his, company, gauss, electrophysics, american, inventor, james, t, russell, has, been, credited, with, inventing, the, first, system, to, record, a, digital, signal, on, an, optical, transparent, foil, that, is, lit, from, behind, by, a, high, power, halogen, lamp, russell, s, patent, application, was, first, filed, in, 1966, and, he, was, granted, a, patent, in, 1970, following, litigation, sony, and, philips, licensed, russell, s, patents, then, held, by, a, canadian, company, optical, recording, corp, in, the, 1980s, both, gregg, s, and, russell, s, disc, are, floppy, media, read, in, transparent, mode, which, imposes, serious, drawbacks, after, this, were, developed, four, generations, of, optical, drive, that, includes, laserdisc, 1969, worm, 1979, compact, discs, 1984, dvd, 1995, blu, ray, 2005, hd, dvd, 2006, more, formats, are, currently, under, development, from, the, start, optical, discs, were, used, to, store, broadcast, quality, analog, video, and, later, digital, media, such, as, music, or, computer, software, the, laserdisc, format, stored, analog, video, signals, for, the, distribution, of, home, video, but, commercially, lost, to, the, vhs, videocassette, format, due, mainly, to, its, high, cost, and, non, re, recordability, other, first, generation, disc, formats, were, designed, only, to, store, digital, data, and, were, not, initially, capable, of, use, as, a, digital, video, medium, most, first, generation, disc, devices, had, an, infrared, laser, reading, head, the, minimum, size, of, the, laser, spot, is, proportional, to, the, wavelength, of, the, laser, so, wavelength, is, a, limiting, factor, upon, the, amount, of, information, that, can, be, stored, in, a, given, physical, area, on, the, disc, the, infrared, range, is, beyond, the, long, wavelength, end, of, the, visible, light, spectrum, so, it, supports, less, density, than, shorter, wavelength, visible, light, one, example, of, high, density, data, storage, capacity, achieved, with, an, infrared, laser, is, 700, mb, of, net, user, data, for, a, 12, cm, compact, disc, other, factors, that, affect, data, storage, density, include, the, existence, of, multiple, layers, of, data, on, the, disc, the, method, of, rotation, constant, linear, velocity, clv, constant, angular, velocity, cav, or, zoned, cav, the, composition, of, lands, and, pits, and, how, much, margin, is, unused, is, at, the, center, and, the, edge, of, the, disc, types, of, optical, discs, in, the, netherlands, in, 1969, philips, research, physicist, pieter, kramer, invented, an, optical, videodisc, in, reflective, mode, with, a, protective, layer, read, by, a, focused, laser, beam, u, s, patent, 5, 068, 846, filed, 1972, issued, 1991, kramer, s, physical, format, is, used, in, all, optical, discs, in, 1975, philips, and, mca, began, to, work, together, and, in, 1978, commercially, much, too, late, they, presented, their, long, awaited, laserdisc, in, atlanta, mca, delivered, the, discs, and, philips, the, players, however, the, presentation, was, a, commercial, failure, and, the, cooperation, ended, in, japan, and, the, u, s, pioneer, succeeded, with, the, laserdisc, until, the, advent, of, the, dvd, in, 1979, philips, and, sony, in, consortium, successfully, developed, the, audio, compact, disc, in, 1979, exxon, star, systems, in, pasadena, ca, built, a, computer, controlled, worm, drive, that, utilized, thin, film, coatings, of, tellurium, and, selenium, on, a, 12, diameter, glass, disk, the, recording, system, utilized, blue, light, at, 457, nm, to, record, and, red, light, at, 632, 8, nm, to, read, star, systems, was, bought, by, storage, technology, corporation, stc, in, 1981, and, moved, to, boulder, co, development, of, the, worm, technology, was, continued, using, 14, diameter, aluminum, substrates, beta, testing, of, the, disk, drives, originally, labeled, the, laser, storage, drive, 2000, lsd, 2000, was, only, moderately, successful, many, of, the, disks, were, shipped, to, rca, laboratories, now, david, sarnoff, research, center, to, be, used, in, the, library, of, congress, archiving, efforts, the, stc, disks, utilized, a, sealed, cartridge, with, an, optical, window, for, protection, u, s, patent, 4, 542, 495, the, cd, rom, format, was, developed, by, sony, and, philips, introduced, in, 1984, as, an, extension, of, compact, disc, digital, audio, and, adapted, to, hold, any, form, of, digital, data, the, same, year, sony, demonstrated, a, laserdisc, data, storage, format, with, a, larger, data, capacity, of, 3, 28, gb, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, optex, inc, of, rockville, md, built, an, erasable, optical, digital, video, disc, system, u, s, patent, 5, 113, 387, using, electron, trapping, optical, media, etom, u, s, patent, 5, 128, 849, although, this, technology, was, written, up, in, video, pro, magazine, s, december, 1994, issue, promising, the, death, of, the, tape, it, was, never, marketed, magnetic, disks, found, limited, applications, in, storing, the, data, in, large, amount, so, there, was, the, need, of, finding, some, more, data, storing, techniques, as, a, result, it, was, found, that, by, using, optical, means, large, data, storing, devices, can, be, made, that, in, turn, gave, rise, to, the, optical, discs, the, very, first, application, of, this, kind, was, the, compact, disc, cd, which, was, used, in, audio, systems, sony, and, philips, developed, the, first, generation, of, the, cds, in, the, mid, 1980s, with, the, complete, specifications, for, these, devices, with, the, help, of, this, kind, of, technology, the, possibility, of, representing, the, analog, signal, into, digital, signal, was, exploited, to, a, great, level, for, this, purpose, the, 16, bit, samples, of, the, analog, signal, were, taken, at, the, rate, of, 44, 100, samples, per, second, this, sample, rate, was, based, on, the, nyquist, rate, of, 40, 000, samples, per, second, required, to, capture, the, audible, frequency, range, to, 20, khz, without, aliasing, with, an, additional, tolerance, to, allow, the, use, of, less, than, perfect, analog, audio, pre, filters, to, remove, any, higher, frequencies, the, first, version, of, the, standard, allowed, up, to, 75, minutes, of, music, which, required, 650, mb, of, storage, second, generation, optical, discs, were, for, storing, great, amounts, of, data, including, broadcast, quality, digital, video, such, discs, usually, are, read, with, a, visible, light, laser, usually, red, the, shorter, wavelength, and, greater, numerical, aperture, allow, a, narrower, light, beam, permitting, smaller, pits, and, lands, in, the, disc, in, the, dvd, format, this, allows, 4, 7, gb, storage, on, a, standard, 12, cm, single, sided, single, layer, disc, alternatively, smaller, media, such, as, the, dataplay, format, can, have, capacity, comparable, to, that, of, the, larger, standard, compact, 12, cm, disc, in, 1995, a, consortium, of, manufacturers, sony, philips, toshiba, panasonic, developed, the, second, generation, of, the, optical, disc, the, dvd, the, dvd, disc, appeared, after, the, cd, rom, had, become, widespread, in, society, third, generation, optical, discs, are, used, for, distributing, high, definition, video, and, videogames, and, support, greater, data, storage, capacities, accomplished, with, short, wavelength, visible, light, lasers, and, greater, numerical, apertures, blu, ray, disc, and, hd, dvd, uses, blue, violet, lasers, and, focusing, optics, of, greater, aperture, for, use, with, discs, with, smaller, pits, and, lands, thereby, greater, data, storage, capacity, per, layer, in, practice, the, effective, multimedia, presentation, capacity, is, improved, with, enhanced, video, data, compression, codecs, such, as, h, 264, mpeg, 4, avc, and, vc, 1, announced, but, not, released, the, third, generation, optical, disc, was, developed, in, 2000, 2006, and, was, introduced, as, blu, ray, disc, first, movies, on, blu, ray, discs, were, released, in, june, 2006, blu, ray, eventually, prevailed, in, a, high, definition, optical, disc, format, war, over, a, competing, format, the, hd, dvd, a, standard, blu, ray, disc, can, hold, about, 25, gb, of, data, a, dvd, about, 4, 7, gb, and, a, cd, about, 700, mb, the, following, formats, go, beyond, the, current, third, generation, discs, and, have, the, potential, to, hold, more, than, one, terabyte, 1, tb, of, data, and, at, least, some, are, meant, for, cold, data, storage, in, data, centers, announced, but, not, released, in, 2004, development, of, the, holographic, versatile, disc, hvd, commenced, which, promised, the, storage, of, several, terabytes, of, data, per, disc, however, development, stagnated, towards, the, late, 2000s, due, to, lack, of, funding, in, 2006, it, was, reported, that, japanese, researchers, developed, ultraviolet, ray, lasers, with, a, wavelength, of, 210, nanometers, which, would, enable, a, higher, bit, density, than, blu, ray, discs, as, of, 2022, no, updates, on, that, project, have, been, reported, folio, photonics, is, planning, to, release, high, capacity, discs, in, 2024, with, the, cost, of, 5, per, tb, with, a, roadmap, to, 1, per, tb, using, 80, less, power, than, hdd, there, are, numerous, formats, of, optical, direct, to, disk, recording, devices, on, the, market, all, of, which, are, based, on, using, a, laser, to, change, the, reflectivity, of, the, digital, recording, medium, in, order, to, duplicate, the, effects, of, the, pits, and, lands, created, when, a, commercial, optical, disc, is, pressed, formats, such, as, cd, r, and, dvd, r, are, write, once, read, many, or, write, once, while, cd, rw, and, dvd, rw, are, rewritable, more, like, a, magnetic, recording, hard, disk, drive, hdd, media, technologies, vary, for, example, m, disc, media, uses, a, rock, like, layer, to, retain, data, for, longer, than, conventional, recordable, media, while, being, read, only, compatible, with, existing, dvd, and, blu, ray, drives, m, disc, media, can, only, be, written, to, using, a, stronger, laser, specifically, made, for, this, purpose, which, is, built, into, fewer, optical, drive, models, optical, media, can, predictively, be, scanned, for, errors, and, media, deterioration, well, before, any, data, becomes, unreadable, optical, formats, include, some, redundancy, for, error, correction, which, works, until, the, amount, of, error, exceeds, a, threshold, a, higher, rate, of, errors, may, indicate, deteriorating, and, or, low, quality, media, physical, damage, an, unclean, surface, and, or, media, written, using, a, defective, optical, drive, precise, error, scanning, requires, access, to, the, raw, uncorrected, readout, of, a, disc, which, is, not, always, provided, by, a, drive, as, a, result, support, of, this, functionality, varies, per, optical, drive, manufacturer, and, model, on, ordinary, drives, without, this, functionality, it, is, possible, to, still, look, for, unexpected, reduction, in, read, speed, as, an, indirect, much, less, reliable, measure, optical, media, such, as, cds, and, dvds, can, be, scanned, to, detect, errors, and, signs, of, deterioration, well, before, data, becomes, unreadable, these, formats, include, built, in, error, correction, mechanisms, which, function, by, adding, redundant, data, however, once, the, rate, of, errors, surpasses, the, correction, threshold, the, media, becomes, vulnerable, to, failure, a, high, error, rate, can, signal, physical, deterioration, low, quality, manufacturing, surface, contamination, or, data, recorded, by, a, faulty, optical, drive, accurate, error, scanning, requires, access, to, a, disc, s, raw, uncorrected, readout, however, not, all, optical, drives, provide, this, capability, and, support, for, this, feature, can, vary, significantly, between, manufacturers, and, drive, models, on, drives, lacking, raw, data, access, users, may, rely, on, a, less, precise, method, monitoring, unexpected, reductions, in, read, speed, though, this, is, a, far, less, reliable, indicator, of, disc, health, several, specialized, tools, are, available, for, performing, error, scans, on, optical, media, popular, programs, include, nero, discspeed, k, probe, opti, drive, control, previously, known, as, cd, speed, 2000, and, dvd, info, pro, for, windows, for, cross, platform, users, qpxtool, is, available, to, help, monitor, and, maintain, optical, media, integrity, each, of, these, tools, allows, for, detailed, analysis, of, the, error, rates, and, conditions, affecting, optical, discs, there, are, different, types, of, error, measurements, including, so, called, c1, c2, and, cu, errors, on, cds, and, pi, po, parity, inner, outer, errors, and, the, more, critical, pi, po, failures, on, dvds, finer, grain, error, measurements, on, cds, supported, by, very, few, optical, drives, are, called, e11, e21, e31, e21, e22, e32, cu, and, pof, represent, uncorrectable, errors, on, data, cds, and, dvds, respectively, thus, data, loss, and, can, be, a, result, of, too, many, consecutive, smaller, errors, due, to, the, weaker, error, correction, used, on, audio, cds, red, book, standard, and, video, cds, white, book, standard, c2, errors, already, lead, to, data, loss, however, even, with, c2, errors, the, damage, is, inaudible, to, some, extent, blu, ray, discs, use, so, called, ldc, long, distance, code, s, and, bis, burst, indication, subcode, s, error, parameters, according, to, the, developer, of, the, opti, drive, control, software, a, disc, can, be, considered, healthy, at, an, ldc, error, rate, below, 13, and, bis, error, rate, below, 15, optical, discs, are, made, using, replication, this, process, can, be, used, with, all, disc, types, recordable, discs, have, pre, recorded, vital, information, like, manufacturer, disc, type, maximum, read, and, write, speeds, etc, in, replication, a, cleanroom, with, yellow, light, is, necessary, to, protect, the, light, sensitive, photoresist, and, to, prevent, dust, from, corrupting, the, data, on, the, disc, a, glass, master, is, used, in, replication, the, master, is, placed, in, a, machine, that, cleans, it, as, much, as, possible, using, a, rotating, brush, and, deionized, water, preparing, it, for, the, next, step, in, the, next, step, a, surface, analyzer, inspects, the, cleanliness, of, the, master, before, photoresist, is, applied, on, the, master, the, photoresist, is, then, baked, in, an, oven, to, solidify, it, then, in, the, exposure, process, the, master, is, placed, in, a, turntable, where, a, laser, selectively, exposes, the, resist, to, light, at, the, same, time, a, developer, and, deionized, water, are, applied, to, the, disc, to, remove, the, exposed, resist, this, process, forms, the, pits, and, lands, that, represent, the, data, on, the, disc, a, thin, coating, of, metal, is, then, applied, to, the, master, making, a, negative, of, the, master, with, the, pits, and, lands, in, it, the, negative, is, then, peeled, off, the, master, and, coated, in, a, thin, layer, of, plastic, the, plastic, protects, the, coating, while, a, punching, press, punches, a, hole, into, the, center, of, the, disc, and, punches, excess, material, the, negative, is, now, a, stamper, a, part, of, the, mold, that, will, be, used, for, replication, it, is, placed, on, one, side, of, the, mold, with, the, data, side, containing, the, pits, and, lands, facing, out, this, is, done, inside, an, injection, molding, machine, the, machine, then, closes, the, mold, and, injects, polycarbonate, in, the, cavity, formed, by, the, walls, of, the, mold, which, forms, or, molds, the, disc, with, the, data, on, it, the, molten, polycarbonate, fills, the, pits, or, spaces, between, the, lands, on, the, negative, acquiring, their, shape, when, it, solidifies, this, step, is, somewhat, similar, to, record, pressing, the, polycarbonate, disc, cools, quickly, and, is, promptly, removed, from, the, machine, before, forming, another, disc, the, disc, is, then, metallized, covered, with, a, thin, reflective, layer, of, aluminum, the, aluminum, fills, the, space, once, occupied, by, the, negative, a, layer, of, varnish, is, then, applied, to, protect, the, aluminum, coating, and, provide, a, surface, suitable, for, printing, the, varnish, is, applied, near, the, center, of, the, disc, and, the, disc, is, spun, evenly, distributing, the, varnish, on, the, surface, of, the, disc, the, varnish, is, hardened, using, uv, light, the, discs, are, then, silkscreened, or, a, label, is, otherwise, applied, recordable, discs, add, a, dye, layer, and, rewritable, discs, add, a, phase, change, alloy, layer, instead, which, is, protected, by, upper, and, lower, dielectric, electrically, insulating, layers, the, layers, may, be, sputtered, the, additional, layer, is, between, the, grooves, and, the, reflective, layer, of, the, disc, grooves, are, made, in, recordable, discs, in, place, of, the, traditional, pits, and, lands, found, in, replicated, discs, and, the, two, can, be, made, in, the, same, exposure, process, in, dvds, the, same, processes, as, in, cds, are, carried, out, but, in, a, thinner, disc, the, thinner, disc, is, then, bonded, to, a, second, equally, thin, but, blank, disc, using, uv, curable, liquid, optically, clear, adhesive, forming, a, dvd, disc, this, leaves, the, data, in, the, middle, of, the, disc, which, is, necessary, for, dvds, to, achieve, their, storage, capacity, in, multi, layer, discs, semi, reflective, instead, of, reflective, coatings, are, used, for, all, layers, except, the, last, layer, which, is, the, deepest, one, and, uses, a, traditional, reflective, coating, dual, layer, dvds, are, made, slightly, differently, after, metallization, with, a, thinner, metal, layer, to, allow, some, light, to, pass, through, base, and, pit, transfer, resins, are, applied, and, pre, cured, in, the, center, of, the, disc, then, the, disc, is, pressed, again, using, a, different, stamper, and, the, resins, are, completely, cured, using, uv, light, before, being, separated, from, the, stamper, then, the, disc, receives, another, thicker, metallization, layer, and, is, then, bonded, to, the, blank, disc, using, loca, glue, dvd, r, dl, and, dvd, r, dl, discs, receive, a, dye, layer, after, curing, but, before, metallization, cd, r, dvd, r, and, dvd, r, discs, receive, the, dye, layer, after, pressing, but, before, metallization, cd, rw, dvd, rw, and, dvd, rw, receive, a, metal, alloy, layer, sandwiched, between, 2, dielectric, layers, hd, dvd, is, made, in, the, same, way, as, dvd, in, recordable, and, rewritable, media, most, of, the, stamper, is, composed, of, grooves, not, pits, and, lands, the, grooves, contain, a, wobble, frequency, that, is, used, to, locate, the, position, of, the, reading, or, writing, laser, on, the, disc, dvds, use, pre, pits, instead, with, a, constant, frequency, wobble, htl, high, to, low, type, blu, ray, discs, are, made, differently, first, a, silicon, wafer, is, used, instead, of, a, glass, master, the, wafer, is, processed, in, the, same, way, a, glass, master, would, the, wafer, is, then, electroplated, to, form, a, 300, micron, thick, nickel, stamper, which, is, peeled, off, from, the, wafer, the, stamper, is, mounted, onto, a, mold, inside, a, press, or, embosser, the, polycarbonate, discs, are, molded, in, a, similar, fashion, to, dvd, and, cd, discs, if, the, discs, being, produced, are, bd, rs, or, bd, res, the, mold, is, fitted, with, a, stamper, that, stamps, a, groove, pattern, onto, the, discs, in, lieu, of, the, pits, and, lands, found, on, bd, rom, discs, after, cooling, a, 35, nanometre, thick, layer, of, silver, alloy, is, applied, to, the, disc, using, sputtering, then, the, second, layer, is, made, by, applying, base, and, pit, transfer, resins, to, the, disc, and, are, pre, cured, in, its, center, after, application, and, pre, curing, the, disc, is, pressed, or, embossed, using, a, stamper, and, the, resins, are, immediately, cured, using, intense, uv, light, before, the, disc, is, separated, from, the, stamper, the, stamper, contains, the, data, that, will, be, transferred, to, the, disc, this, process, is, known, as, embossing, and, is, the, step, that, engraves, the, data, onto, the, disc, replacing, the, pressing, process, used, in, the, first, layer, and, it, is, also, used, for, multi, layer, dvd, discs, then, a, 30, nanometre, thick, layer, of, silver, alloy, is, then, sputtered, onto, the, disc, and, the, process, is, repeated, as, many, times, as, required, each, repetition, creates, a, new, data, layer, the, resins, are, applied, again, pre, cured, stamped, with, data, or, grooves, and, cured, silver, alloy, is, sputtered, and, so, on, bd, r, and, bd, re, discs, receive, through, sputtering, a, metal, recording, layer, alloy, that, is, sandwiched, between, two, dielectric, layers, also, sputtered, in, bd, re, before, receiving, the, 30, nanometre, metallization, silver, alloy, aluminum, or, gold, layer, which, is, sputtered, alternatively, the, silver, alloy, may, be, applied, before, the, recording, layer, is, applied, silver, alloys, are, usually, used, in, blu, rays, and, aluminum, is, usually, used, on, cds, and, dvds, gold, is, used, in, some, archival, cds, and, dvds, since, it, is, more, chemically, inert, and, resistant, to, corrosion, than, aluminum, which, corrodes, into, aluminum, oxide, which, can, be, seen, in, disc, rot, as, transparent, patches, or, dots, in, the, disc, that, prevent, the, disc, from, being, read, since, the, laser, light, passes, through, the, disc, instead, of, being, reflected, back, into, the, laser, pickup, assembly, to, be, read, normally, aluminum, does, not, corrode, since, it, has, a, thin, oxide, layer, that, forms, on, contact, with, oxygen, in, this, case, it, can, corrode, due, to, its, thinness, then, the, 98, micron, thick, cover, layer, is, applied, using, uv, curable, liquid, optically, clear, adhesive, and, a, 2, micron, thick, hard, coat, such, as, durabis, is, also, applied, and, cured, using, uv, light, in, the, last, step, a, 10, nanometre, thick, silicon, nitride, barrier, layer, is, applied, to, the, label, side, of, the, disc, to, protect, against, humidity, blu, rays, have, their, data, very, close, to, the, read, surface, of, the, disc, which, is, necessary, for, blu, rays, to, achieve, their, capacity, discs, in, large, quantities, can, either, be, replicated, or, duplicated, in, replication, the, process, explained, above, is, used, to, make, the, discs, while, in, duplication, cd, r, dvd, r, or, bd, r, discs, are, recorded, and, finalized, to, prevent, further, recording, and, allow, for, wider, compatibility, see, optical, disc, authoring, the, equipment, is, also, different, replication, is, carried, out, by, fully, automated, purpose, built, machinery, whose, cost, is, in, the, hundreds, of, thousands, of, us, dollars, in, the, used, market, while, duplication, can, be, automated, using, what, s, known, as, an, autoloader, or, be, done, by, hand, and, only, requires, a, small, tabletop, duplicator
