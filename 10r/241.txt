or, pyrotechnics, combining, a, large, number, of, devices, in, an, outdoor, setting, such, displays, are, the, focal, point, of, many, cultural, and, religious, celebrations, though, mismanagement, could, lead, to, fireworks, accidents, fireworks, take, many, forms, to, produce, four, primary, effects, noise, light, smoke, and, floating, materials, confetti, most, notably, they, may, be, designed, to, burn, with, colored, flames, and, sparks, including, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and, silver, they, are, generally, classified, by, where, they, perform, either, ground, or, aerial, aerial, fireworks, may, have, their, own, propulsion, skyrocket, or, be, shot, into, the, air, by, a, mortar, aerial, shell, most, fireworks, consist, of, a, paper, or, pasteboard, tube, or, casing, filled, with, the, combustible, material, often, pyrotechnic, stars, a, number, of, these, tubes, or, cases, may, be, combined, so, as, to, make, when, kindled, a, great, variety, of, sparkling, shapes, often, variously, colored, a, skyrocket, is, a, common, form, of, firework, although, the, first, skyrockets, were, used, in, warfare, the, aerial, shell, however, is, the, backbone, of, today, s, commercial, aerial, display, and, a, smaller, version, for, consumer, use, is, known, as, the, festival, ball, in, the, united, states, fireworks, were, originally, invented, in, china, china, remains, the, largest, manufacturer, and, exporter, of, fireworks, in, the, world, silent, fireworks, displays, are, becoming, popular, due, to, concerns, that, noise, effects, traumatize, pets, wildlife, and, some, humans, however, these, are, not, a, new, type, of, firework, and, they, are, not, completely, silent, silent, firework, displays, refers, to, displays, which, simply, exclude, large, spectacular, noisy, fireworks, and, make, greater, use, of, smaller, quieter, devices, the, earliest, fireworks, came, from, china, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, fireworks, were, used, to, accompany, many, festivities, in, china, pyrotechnicians, were, respected, for, their, knowledge, of, complex, techniques, in, creating, fireworks, and, mounting, firework, displays, during, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, 220, ad, people, threw, bamboo, stems, into, a, fire, to, produce, an, explosion, with, a, loud, sound, in, later, times, gunpowder, packed, into, small, containers, was, used, to, mimic, the, sounds, of, burning, bamboo, exploding, bamboo, stems, and, gunpowder, firecrackers, were, interchangeably, known, as, baozhu, or, baogan, during, the, song, dynasty, people, manufactured, the, first, firecrackers, comprising, tubes, made, from, rolled, sheets, of, paper, containing, gunpowder, and, a, fuse, they, also, strung, these, firecrackers, together, into, large, clusters, known, as, bian, lit, whip, or, bianpao, lit, whip, cannon, so, the, firecrackers, could, be, set, off, one, by, one, in, close, sequence, by, the, 12th, and, possibly, the, 11th, century, the, term, baozhang, was, used, to, specifically, refer, to, gunpowder, firecrackers, the, first, usage, of, the, term, was, in, the, dreams, of, the, glories, of, the, eastern, capital, about, 1148, by, meng, yuanlao, during, the, song, dynasty, common, folk, could, purchase, fireworks, such, as, firecrackers, from, market, vendors, grand, displays, of, fireworks, were, also, known, to, be, held, in, 1110, according, to, the, dreams, of, the, glories, of, the, eastern, capital, a, large, fireworks, display, mounted, by, the, military, was, held, to, entertain, emperor, huizong, of, song, r, 1100, 1125, the, qidong, yeyu, 1264, states, that, a, rocket, propelled, firework, called, a, dilaoshu, lit, earth, rat, went, off, near, the, empress, dowager, gong, sheng, and, startled, her, during, a, feast, held, in, her, honor, by, her, son, emperor, lizong, of, song, r, 1224, 1264, this, type, of, firework, was, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, rocket, propulsion, around, 1280, a, syrian, named, hasan, al, rammah, wrote, of, rockets, fireworks, and, other, incendiaries, using, terms, that, suggested, he, derived, his, knowledge, from, chinese, sources, such, as, his, references, to, fireworks, as, chinese, flowers, colored, fireworks, were, developed, from, earlier, possibly, han, dynasty, or, soon, thereafter, chinese, application, of, chemical, substances, to, create, colored, smoke, and, fire, such, application, appears, in, the, huolongjing, 14th, century, and, wubeizhi, preface, of, 1621, printed, 1628, which, describes, recipes, several, of, which, used, low, nitrate, gunpowder, to, create, military, signal, smokes, with, various, colors, in, the, wubei, huolongjing, ming, completed, after, 1628, two, formulas, appears, for, firework, like, signals, the, sanzhangju, and, baizhanglian, that, produces, silver, sparkles, in, the, smoke, in, the, huoxil, e, 1753, by, zhao, xuemin, there, are, several, recipes, with, low, nitrate, gunpowder, and, other, chemical, substances, to, tint, flames, and, smoke, these, included, for, instance, arsenical, sulphide, for, yellow, copper, acetate, verdigris, for, green, lead, carbonate, for, lilac, white, and, mercurous, chloride, calomel, for, white, the, chinese, pyrotechnics, were, described, by, the, french, author, antoine, caillot, 1818, it, is, certain, that, the, variety, of, colours, which, the, chinese, have, the, secret, of, giving, to, flame, is, the, greatest, mystery, of, their, fireworks, similarly, the, english, geographer, sir, john, barrow, ca, 1797, wrote, the, diversity, of, colours, indeed, with, which, the, chinese, have, the, secret, of, cloathing, fire, seems, to, be, the, chief, merit, of, their, pyrotechny, fireworks, were, produced, in, europe, by, the, 14th, century, becoming, popular, by, the, 17th, century, lev, izmailov, ambassador, of, peter, the, great, once, reported, from, china, they, make, such, fireworks, that, no, one, in, europe, has, ever, seen, in, 1758, the, jesuit, missionary, pierre, nicolas, le, ch, ron, d, incarville, living, in, beijing, wrote, about, the, methods, and, composition, of, chinese, fireworks, to, the, paris, academy, of, sciences, which, published, the, account, five, years, later, am, d, e, fran, ois, fr, zier, published, his, revised, work, trait, des, feux, d, artice, pour, le, spectacle, treatise, on, fireworks, in, 1747, originally, 1706, covering, the, recreational, and, ceremonial, uses, of, fireworks, rather, than, their, military, uses, music, for, the, royal, fireworks, was, composed, by, george, frideric, handel, in, 1749, to, celebrate, the, peace, treaty, of, aix, la, chapelle, which, had, been, declared, the, previous, year, prior, to, the, nineteenth, century, and, the, advent, of, modern, chemistry, they, must, have, been, relatively, dull, and, unexciting, bertholet, in, 1786, discovered, that, oxidations, with, potassium, chlorate, resulted, in, a, violet, emission, subsequent, developments, revealed, that, oxidations, with, the, chlorates, of, barium, strontium, copper, and, sodium, result, in, intense, emission, of, bright, colors, the, isolation, of, metallic, magnesium, and, aluminium, marked, another, breakthrough, as, these, metals, burn, with, an, intense, silvery, light, improper, use, of, fireworks, is, dangerous, both, to, the, person, operating, them, risks, of, burns, and, wounds, and, to, bystanders, in, addition, they, may, start, fires, on, landing, to, prevent, fireworks, accidents, the, use, of, fireworks, is, legally, restricted, in, many, countries, in, such, countries, display, fireworks, are, restricted, for, use, by, professionals, smaller, consumer, versions, may, or, may, not, be, available, to, the, public, birds, and, animals, both, domestic, and, wild, can, be, frightened, by, their, noise, leading, to, them, running, away, often, into, danger, or, hurting, themselves, on, fences, or, in, other, ways, in, an, attempt, to, escape, the, perceived, danger, majority, of, dogs, experience, distress, fear, and, anxiety, during, fireworks, in, 2016, following, a, petition, signed, by, more, than, 100, 000, brits, house, of, commons, of, the, united, kingdom, debated, a, motion, to, restrict, firework, use, fireworks, also, affect, birds, especially, larger, birds, like, geese, eagles, and, others, according, to, a, study, by, max, planck, institute, and, netherlands, institute, of, ecology, many, birds, abruptly, leave, their, sleeping, sites, on, new, year, s, eve, and, some, fly, up, to, 500, km, non, stop, to, get, away, from, human, settlements, on, average, about, 1000, times, more, birds, are, in, flight, on, new, year, s, eve, than, on, other, nights, frightened, birds, also, may, abandon, nests, and, not, return, to, complete, rearing, their, young, a, scientific, study, from, 2022, indicates, that, fireworks, might, have, some, sort, of, lasting, effect, on, birds, with, many, birds, spending, more, time, to, find, food, in, the, weeks, after, new, year, s, eve, fireworks, fireworks, produce, smoke, and, dust, that, may, contain, residues, of, heavy, metals, sulfur, coal, compounds, and, some, low, concentration, toxic, chemicals, these, by, products, of, fireworks, combustion, will, vary, depending, on, the, mix, of, ingredients, of, a, particular, firework, the, color, green, for, instance, may, be, produced, by, adding, the, various, compounds, and, salts, of, barium, some, of, which, are, toxic, and, some, of, which, are, not, some, fishers, have, noticed, and, reported, to, environmental, authorities, that, firework, residues, can, hurt, fish, and, other, water, life, because, some, may, contain, toxic, compounds, such, as, antimony, sulfide, or, arsenic, this, is, a, subject, of, much, debate, due, to, the, fact, that, large, scale, pollution, from, other, sources, makes, it, difficult, to, measure, the, amount, of, pollution, that, comes, specifically, from, fireworks, the, possible, toxicity, of, any, fallout, may, also, be, affected, by, the, amount, of, black, powder, used, type, of, oxidizer, colors, produced, and, launch, method, perchlorate, salts, when, in, solid, form, dissolve, and, move, rapidly, in, groundwater, and, surface, water, even, in, low, concentrations, in, drinking, water, supplies, perchlorate, ions, are, known, to, inhibit, the, uptake, of, iodine, by, the, thyroid, gland, as, of, 2010, there, are, no, federal, drinking, water, standards, for, perchlorates, in, the, united, states, but, the, us, environmental, protection, agency, has, studied, the, impacts, of, perchlorates, on, the, environment, as, well, as, drinking, water, several, u, s, states, have, enacted, drinking, water, standard, for, perchlorates, including, massachusetts, in, 2006, california, s, legislature, enacted, ab, 826, the, perchlorate, contamination, prevention, act, of, 2003, requiring, california, s, department, of, toxic, substance, control, dtsc, to, adopt, regulations, specifying, best, management, practices, for, perchlorate, containing, substances, the, perchlorate, best, management, practices, were, adopted, on, 31, december, 2005, and, became, operative, on, 1, july, 2006, california, issued, drinking, water, standards, in, 2007, several, other, states, including, arizona, maryland, nevada, new, mexico, new, york, and, texas, have, established, non, enforceable, advisory, levels, for, perchlorates, the, courts, have, also, taken, action, with, regard, to, perchlorate, contamination, for, example, in, 2003, a, federal, district, court, in, california, found, that, comprehensive, environmental, response, compensation, and, liability, act, cercla, applied, because, perchlorate, is, ignitable, and, therefore, a, characteristic, hazardous, waste, pollutants, from, fireworks, raise, concerns, because, of, potential, health, risks, associated, with, the, products, of, combustion, during, the, liquid, phase, and, the, solid, phase, after, they, have, cooled, as, well, as, the, gases, produced, particularly, the, carbon, monoxide, and, carbon, dioxide, for, persons, with, asthma, or, other, respiratory, conditions, the, smoke, from, fireworks, may, aggravate, existing, health, problems, pollution, is, also, a, concern, because, fireworks, often, contain, heavy, metals, as, source, of, color, however, gunpowder, smoke, and, the, solid, residues, are, basic, and, as, such, the, cumulative, effect, of, fireworks, on, acid, rain, is, uncertain, what, is, not, disputed, is, that, most, consumer, fireworks, leave, behind, a, considerable, amount, of, solid, debris, including, both, readily, biodegradable, components, as, well, as, nondegradable, plastic, items, concerns, over, pollution, consumer, safety, and, debris, have, restricted, the, sale, and, use, of, consumer, fireworks, in, many, countries, professional, displays, on, the, other, hand, remain, popular, around, the, world, others, argue, that, alleged, concern, over, pollution, from, fireworks, constitutes, a, red, herring, since, the, amount, of, contamination, from, fireworks, is, minuscule, in, comparison, to, emissions, from, sources, such, as, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, in, the, us, some, states, and, local, governments, restrict, the, use, of, fireworks, in, accordance, with, the, clean, air, act, which, allows, laws, relating, to, the, prevention, and, control, of, outdoor, air, pollution, to, be, enacted, some, companies, within, the, u, s, fireworks, industry, claim, they, are, working, with, chinese, manufacturers, to, reduce, and, ultimately, hope, to, eliminate, of, the, pollutant, perchlorate, fireworks, are, illegal, in, most, australian, states, and, territories, unless, part, of, a, display, by, a, licensed, pyrotechnician, and, with, a, permit, however, tasmania, act, and, northern, territory, allow, consumer, use, with, a, permit, dependent, on, calendar, date, and, circumstances, on, 1, july, for, territory, day, one, can, freely, use, fireworks, without, a, permit, in, the, northern, territory, small, novelties, such, as, party, poppers, and, sparklers, are, legal, for, consumers, across, australia, on, 24, august, 2009, the, act, government, announced, a, complete, ban, on, backyard, fireworks, the, use, storage, and, sale, of, commercial, grade, fireworks, in, canada, is, licensed, by, natural, resources, canada, s, explosive, regulatory, division, erd, unlike, their, consumer,

pyrotechnics, those, used, on, stage, and, in, movies, and, another, for, display, fireworks, those, used, in, dedicated, fireworks, shows, each, requires, completion, of, its, own, course, although, there, are, special, categories, of, foc, which, allow, visiting, operators, to, run, their, shows, with, the, assistance, of, a, canadian, supervisor, the, display, fireworks, foc, has, two, levels, assistant, and, fully, licensed, a, fully, licensed, display, fireworks, operator, can, also, be, further, endorsed, for, marine, launch, flying, saucers, and, other, more, technically, demanding,

allows, the, fabrication, of, certain, types, of, pyrotechnic, devices, additionally, a, special, effects, pyrotechnician, can, be, endorsed, for, the, use, of, detonating, cord, since, commercial, grade, fireworks, are, shells, which, are, loaded, into, separate, mortars, by, hand, there, is, danger, in, every, stage, of, the, setup, setup, of, these, fireworks, involves, the, placement, and, securing, of, mortars, on, wooden, or, wire, racks, loading, of, the, shells, and, if, electronically, firing, wiring, and, testing, the, mortars, are, generally, made, of, fre, fiber, reinforced, epoxy, or, hdpe, high, density, polyethylene, older, mortars, made, of, sheet, steel, have, been, banned, by, most, countries, due, to, the, problem, of, shrapnel, produced, during, a, misfire, setup, of, mortars, in, canada, for, an, oblong, firing, site, require, that, a, mortar, be, configured, at, an, angle, of, 10, to, 15, degrees, down, range, with, a, safety, distance, of, at, least, 200, meters, 660, ft, down, range, and, 100, meters, 330, ft, surrounding, the, mortars, plus, distance, adjustments, for, wind, speed, and, direction, in, june, 2007, the, erd, approved, circular, firing, sites, for, use, with, vertically, fired, mortars, with, a, safety, distance, of, at, least, 175, meter, 574, ft, radius, plus, distance, adjustments, for, wind, speed, and, direction, loading, of, shells, is, a, delicate, process, and, must, be, done, with, caution, and, a, loader, must, ensure, not, only, the, mortar, is, clean, but, also, make, sure, that, no, part, of, their, body, is, directly, over, the, mortar, in, case, of, a, premature, fire, wiring, the, shells, is, a, painstaking, process, whether, the, shells, are, being, fired, manually, or, electronically, any, chain, fusing, or, wiring, of, electrical, ignitors, care, must, be, taken, to, prevent, the, fuse, an, electrical, match, often, incorrectly, called, a, squib, from, igniting, if, the, setup, is, wired, electrically, the, electrical, matches, are, usually, plugged, into, a, firing, rail, or, breakout, box, that, runs, back, to, the, main, firing, board, from, there, the, firing, board, is, simply, hooked, up, to, a, car, battery, and, can, proceed, with, firing, the, show, when, ready, since, commercial, grade, fireworks, are, so, much, larger, and, more, powerful, setup, and, firing, crews,
