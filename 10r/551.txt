a, thermonuclear, weapon, fusion, weapon, or, hydrogen, bomb, h, bomb, is, a, second, generation, nuclear, weapon, design, its, greater, sophistication, affords, it, vastly, greater, destructive, power, than, first, generation, nuclear, bombs, a, more, compact, size, a, lower, mass, or, a, combination, of, these, benefits, characteristics, of, nuclear, fusion, reactions, make, possible, the, use, of, non, fissile, depleted, uranium, as, the, weapon, s, main, fuel, thus, allowing, more, efficient, use, of, scarce, fissile, material, such, as, uranium, 235, 235, u, or, plutonium, 239, 239, pu, the, first, full, scale, thermonuclear, test, ivy, mike, was, carried, out, by, the, united, states, in, 1952, and, the, concept, has, since, been, employed, by, most, of, the, world, s, nuclear, powers, in, the, design, of, their, weapons, modern, fusion, weapons, essentially, consist, of, two, main, components, a, nuclear, fission, primary, stage, fueled, by, 235, u, or, 239, pu, and, a, separate, nuclear, fusion, secondary, stage, containing, thermonuclear, fuel, heavy, isotopes, of, hydrogen, deuterium, and, tritium, as, the, pure, element, or, in, modern, weapons, lithium, deuteride, for, this, reason, thermonuclear, weapons, are, often, colloquially, called, hydrogen, bombs, or, h, bombs, a, fusion, explosion, begins, with, the, detonation, of, the, fission, primary, stage, its, temperature, soars, past, 100, million, kelvin, causing, it, to, glow, intensely, with, thermal, soft, x, rays, these, x, rays, flood, the, void, the, radiation, channel, often, filled, with, polystyrene, foam, between, the, primary, and, secondary, assemblies, placed, within, an, enclosure, called, a, radiation, case, which, confines, the, x, ray, energy, and, resists, its, outward, pressure, the, distance, separating, the, two, assemblies, ensures, that, debris, fragments, from, the, fission, primary, which, move, much, more, slowly, than, x, ray, photons, cannot, disassemble, the, secondary, before, the, fusion, explosion, runs, to, completion, the, secondary, fusion, stage, consisting, of, outer, pusher, tamper, fusion, fuel, filler, and, central, plutonium, spark, plug, is, imploded, by, the, x, ray, energy, impinging, on, its, pusher, tamper, this, compresses, the, entire, secondary, stage, and, drives, up, the, density, of, the, plutonium, spark, plug, the, density, of, the, plutonium, fuel, rises, to, such, an, extent, that, the, spark, plug, is, driven, into, a, supercritical, state, and, it, begins, a, nuclear, fission, chain, reaction, the, fission, products, of, this, chain, reaction, heat, the, highly, compressed, and, thus, super, dense, thermonuclear, fuel, surrounding, the, spark, plug, to, around, 300, million, kelvin, igniting, fusion, reactions, between, fusion, fuel, nuclei, in, modern, weapons, fueled, by, lithium, deuteride, the, fissioning, plutonium, spark, plug, also, emits, free, neutrons, that, collide, with, lithium, nuclei, and, supply, the, tritium, component, of, the, thermonuclear, fuel, the, secondary, s, relatively, massive, tamper, which, resists, outward, expansion, as, the, explosion, proceeds, also, serves, as, a, thermal, barrier, to, keep, the, fusion, fuel, filler, from, becoming, too, hot, which, would, spoil, the, compression, if, made, of, uranium, enriched, uranium, or, plutonium, the, tamper, captures, fast, fusion, neutrons, and, undergoes, fission, itself, increasing, the, overall, explosive, yield, additionally, in, most, designs, the, radiation, case, is, also, constructed, of, a, material, that, undergoes, fission, driven, by, fast, thermonuclear, neutrons, such, bombs, are, classified, as, two, stage, weapons, fast, fission, of, the, tamper, and, radiation, case, is, the, main, contribution, to, the, total, yield, and, is, the, dominant, process, that, produces, radioactive, fission, product, fallout, before, ivy, mike, operation, greenhouse, in, 1951, was, the, first, american, nuclear, test, series, to, test, principles, that, led, to, the, development, of, thermonuclear, weapons, sufficient, fission, was, achieved, to, boost, the, associated, fusion, device, and, enough, was, learned, to, achieve, a, full, scale, device, within, a, year, the, design, of, all, modern, thermonuclear, weapons, in, the, united, states, is, known, as, the, teller, ulam, configuration, for, its, two, chief, contributors, edward, teller, and, stanis, aw, ulam, who, developed, it, in, 1951, for, the, united, states, with, certain, concepts, developed, with, the, contribution, of, physicist, john, von, neumann, similar, devices, were, developed, by, the, soviet, union, united, kingdom, france, china, and, india, the, thermonuclear, tsar, bomba, was, the, most, powerful, bomb, ever, detonated, as, thermonuclear, weapons, represent, the, most, efficient, design, for, weapon, energy, yield, in, weapons, with, yields, above, 50, kilotons, of, tnt, 210, tj, virtually, all, the, nuclear, weapons, of, this, size, deployed, by, the, five, nuclear, weapon, states, under, the, non, proliferation, treaty, today, are, thermonuclear, weapons, using, the, teller, ulam, design, detailed, knowledge, of, fission, and, fusion, weapons, is, classified, to, some, degree, in, virtually, every, industrialized, country, in, the, united, states, such, knowledge, can, by, default, be, classified, as, restricted, data, even, if, it, is, created, by, persons, who, are, not, government, employees, or, associated, with, weapons, programs, in, a, legal, doctrine, known, as, born, secret, though, the, constitutional, standing, of, the, doctrine, has, been, at, times, called, into, question, see, united, states, v, progressive, inc, born, secret, is, rarely, invoked, for, cases, of, private, speculation, the, official, policy, of, the, united, states, department, of, energy, has, been, not, to, acknowledge, the, leaking, of, design, information, as, such, acknowledgment, would, potentially, validate, the, information, as, accurate, in, a, small, number, of, prior, cases, the, u, s, government, has, attempted, to, censor, weapons, information, in, the, public, press, with, limited, success, according, to, the, new, york, times, physicist, kenneth, w, ford, defied, government, orders, to, remove, classified, information, from, his, book, building, the, h, bomb, a, personal, history, ford, claims, he, used, only, pre, existing, information, and, even, submitted, a, manuscript, to, the, government, which, wanted, to, remove, entire, sections, of, the, book, for, concern, that, foreign, states, could, use, the, information, though, large, quantities, of, vague, data, have, been, officially, released, and, larger, quantities, of, vague, data, have, been, unofficially, leaked, by, former, bomb, designers, most, public, descriptions, of, nuclear, weapon, design, details, rely, to, some, degree, on, speculation, reverse, engineering, from, known, information, or, comparison, with, similar, fields, of, physics, inertial, confinement, fusion, is, the, primary, example, such, processes, have, resulted, in, a, body, of, unclassified, knowledge, about, nuclear, bombs, that, is, generally, consistent, with, official, unclassified, information, releases, and, related, physics, and, is, thought, to, be, internally, consistent, though, there, are, some, points, of, interpretation, that, are, still, considered, open, the, state, of, public, knowledge, about, the, teller, ulam, design, has, been, mostly, shaped, from, a, few, specific, incidents, outlined, in, a, section, below, the, basic, principle, of, the, teller, ulam, configuration, is, the, idea, that, different, parts, of, a, thermonuclear, weapon, can, be, chained, together, in, stages, with, the, detonation, of, each, stage, providing, the, energy, to, ignite, the, next, stage, at, a, minimum, this, implies, a, primary, section, that, consists, of, an, implosion, type, fission, bomb, a, trigger, and, a, secondary, section, that, consists, of, fusion, fuel, the, energy, released, by, the, primary, compresses, the, secondary, through, the, process, of, radiation, implosion, at, which, point, it, is, heated, and, undergoes, nuclear, fusion, this, process, could, be, continued, with, energy, from, the, secondary, igniting, a, third, fusion, stage, the, soviet, union, s, an602, tsar, bomba, is, thought, to, have, been, a, three, stage, fission, fusion, fusion, device, theoretically, by, continuing, this, process, thermonuclear, weapons, with, arbitrarily, high, yield, could, be, constructed, this, contrasts, with, fission, weapons, which, are, limited, in, yield, because, only, so, much, fission, fuel, can, be, amassed, in, one, place, before, the, danger, of, its, accidentally, becoming, supercritical, becomes, too, great, surrounding, the, other, components, is, a, hohlraum, or, radiation, case, a, container, that, traps, the, first, stage, or, primary, s, energy, inside, temporarily, the, outside, of, this, radiation, case, which, is, also, normally, the, outside, casing, of, the, bomb, is, the, only, direct, visual, evidence, publicly, available, of, any, thermonuclear, bomb, component, s, configuration, numerous, photographs, of, various, thermonuclear, bomb, exteriors, have, been, declassified, the, primary, is, thought, to, be, a, standard, implosion, method, fission, bomb, though, likely, with, a, core, boosted, by, small, amounts, of, fusion, fuel, usually, 1, 1, deuterium, tritium, gas, for, extra, efficiency, the, fusion, fuel, releases, excess, neutrons, when, heated, and, compressed, inducing, additional, fission, when, fired, the, 239, pu, or, 235, u, core, would, be, compressed, to, a, smaller, sphere, by, special, layers, of, conventional, high, explosives, arranged, around, it, in, an, explosive, lens, pattern, initiating, the, nuclear, chain, reaction, that, powers, the, conventional, atomic, bomb, the, secondary, is, usually, shown, as, a, column, of, fusion, fuel, and, other, components, wrapped, in, many, layers, around, the, column, is, first, a, pusher, tamper, a, heavy, layer, of, uranium, 238, 238, u, or, lead, that, helps, compress, the, fusion, fuel, and, in, the, case, of, uranium, may, eventually, undergo, fission, itself, inside, this, is, the, fusion, fuel, usually, a, form, of, lithium, deuteride, which, is, used, because, it, is, easier, to, weaponize, than, liquefied, tritium, deuterium, gas, this, dry, fuel, when, bombarded, by, neutrons, produces, tritium, a, heavy, isotope, of, hydrogen, that, can, undergo, nuclear, fusion, along, with, the, deuterium, present, in, the, mixture, see, the, article, on, nuclear, fusion, for, a, more, detailed, technical, discussion, of, fusion, reactions, inside, the, layer, of, fuel, is, the, spark, plug, a, hollow, column, of, fissile, material, 239, pu, or, 235, u, often, boosted, by, deuterium, gas, the, spark, plug, when, compressed, can, undergo, nuclear, fission, because, of, the, shape, it, is, not, a, critical, mass, without, compression, the, tertiary, if, one, is, present, would, be, set, below, the, secondary, and, probably, be, made, of, the, same, materials, separating, the, secondary, from, the, primary, is, the, interstage, the, fissioning, primary, produces, four, types, of, energy, 1, expanding, hot, gases, from, high, explosive, charges, that, implode, the, primary, 2, superheated, plasma, that, was, originally, the, bomb, s, fissile, material, and, its, tamper, 3, the, electromagnetic, radiation, and, 4, the, neutrons, from, the, primary, s, nuclear, detonation, the, interstage, is, responsible, for, accurately, modulating, the, transfer, of, energy, from, the, primary, to, the, secondary, it, must, direct, the, hot, gases, plasma, electromagnetic, radiation, and, neutrons, toward, the, right, place, at, the, right, time, less, than, optimal, interstage, designs, have, resulted, in, the, secondary, failing, to, work, entirely, on, multiple, shots, known, as, a, fissile, fizzle, the, castle, koon, shot, of, operation, castle, is, a, good, example, a, small, flaw, allowed, the, neutron, flux, from, the, primary, to, prematurely, begin, heating, the, secondary, weakening, the, compression, enough, to, prevent, any, fusion, there, is, very, little, detailed, information, in, the, open, literature, about, the, mechanism, of, the, interstage, one, of, the, best, sources, is, a, simplified, diagram, of, a, british, thermonuclear, weapon, similar, to, the, american, w80, warhead, it, was, released, by, greenpeace, in, a, report, titled, dual, use, nuclear, technology, the, major, components, and, their, arrangement, are, in, the, diagram, though, details, are, almost, absent, what, scattered, details, it, does, include, likely, have, intentional, omissions, or, inaccuracies, they, are, labeled, end, cap, and, neutron, focus, lens, and, reflector, wrap, the, former, channels, neutrons, to, the, 235, u, 239, pu, spark, plug, while, the, latter, refers, to, an, x, ray, reflector, typically, a, cylinder, made, of, an, x, ray, opaque, material, such, as, uranium, with, the, primary, and, secondary, at, either, end, it, does, not, reflect, like, a, mirror, instead, it, gets, heated, to, a, high, temperature, by, the, x, ray, flux, from, the, primary, then, it, emits, more, evenly, spread, x, rays, that, travel, to, the, secondary, causing, what, is, known, as, radiation, implosion, in, ivy, mike, gold, was, used, as, a, coating, over, the, uranium, to, enhance, the, blackbody, effect, next, comes, the, reflector, neutron, gun, carriage, the, reflector, seals, the, gap, between, the, neutron, focus, lens, in, the, center, and, the, outer, casing, near, the, primary, it, separates, the, primary, from, the, secondary, and, performs, the, same, function, as, the, previous, reflector, there, are, about, six, neutron, guns, seen, here, from, sandia, national, laboratories, each, protruding, through, the, outer, edge, of, the, reflector, with, one, end, in, each, section, all, are, clamped, to, the, carriage, and, arranged, more, or, less, evenly, around, the, casing, s, circumference, the, neutron, guns, are, tilted, so, the, neutron, emitting, end, of, each, gun, end, is, pointed, towards, the, central, axis, of, the, bomb, neutrons, from, each, neutron, gun, pass, through, and, are, focused, by, the, neutron, focus, lens, towards, the, centre, of, primary, in, order, to, boost, the, initial, fissioning, of, the, plutonium, a, polystyrene, polarizer, plasma, source, is, also, shown, see, below, the, first, u, s, government, document, to, mention, the, interstage, was, only, recently, released, to, the, public, promoting, the, 2004, initiation, of, the, reliable, replacement, warhead, rrw, program, a, graphic, includes, blurbs, describing, the, potential, advantage, of, a, rrw, on, a, part, by, part, level, with, the, interstage, blurb, saying, a, new, design, would, replace, toxic, brittle, material, and, expensive, special, material, unique, facilities, the, toxic, brittle, material, is, widely, assumed, to, be, beryllium, which, fits, that, description, and, would, also, moderate, the, neutron, flux, from, the, primary, some, material, to, absorb, and, re, radiate, the, x, rays, in, a, particular, manner, may, also, be, used, candidates, for, the, special, material, are, polystyrene, and, a, substance, called, fogbank, an, unclassified, codename, fogbank, s, composition, is, classified, though, aerogel, has, been, suggested, as, a, possibility, it, was, first, used, in, thermonuclear, weapons, with, the, w76, thermonuclear, warhead, and, produced, at, a, plant, in, the, y, 12, complex, at, oak, ridge, tennessee, for, use, in, the, w76, production, of, fogbank, lapsed, after, the, w76, production, run, ended, the, w76, life, extension, program, required, more, fogbank, to, be, made, this, was, complicated, by, the, fact, that, the, original, fogbank, s, properties, were, not, fully, documented, so, a, massive, effort, was, mounted, to, re, invent, the, process, an, impurity, crucial, to, the, properties, of, the, old, fogbank, was, omitted, during, the, new, process, only, close, analysis, of, new, and, old, batches, revealed, the, nature, of, that, impurity, the, manufacturing, process, used, acetonitrile, as, a, solvent, which, led, to, at, least, three, evacuations, of, the, fogbank, plant, in, 2006, widely, used, in, the, petroleum, and, pharmaceutical, industries, acetonitrile, is, flammable, and, toxic, y, 12, is, the, sole, producer, of, fogbank, a, simplified, summary, of, the, above, explanation, is, how, exactly, the, energy, is, transported, from, the, primary, to, the, secondary, has, been, the, subject, of, some, disagreement, in, the, open, press, but, is, thought, to, be, transmitted, through, the, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, that, are, emitted, from, the, fissioning, primary, this, energy, is, then, used, to, compress, the, secondary, the, crucial, detail, of, how, the, x, rays, create, the, pressure, is, the, main, remaining, disputed, point, in, the, unclassified, press, there, are, three, proposed, theories, the, radiation, pressure, exerted, by, the, large, quantity, of, x, ray, photons, inside, the, closed, casing, might, be, enough, to, compress, the, secondary, electromagnetic, radiation, such, as, x, rays, or, light, carries, momentum, and, exerts, a, force, on, any, surface, it, strikes, the, pressure, of, radiation, at, the, intensities, seen, in, everyday, life, such, as, sunlight, striking, a, surface, is, usually, imperceptible, but, at, the, extreme, intensities, found, in, a, thermonuclear, bomb, the, pressure, is, enormous, for, two, thermonuclear, bombs, for, which, the, general, size, and, primary, characteristics, are, well, understood, the, ivy, mike, test, bomb, and, the, modern, w, 80, cruise, missile, warhead, variant, of, the, w, 61, design, the, radiation, pressure, was, calculated, to, be, 73, 10, 6, bar, 7, 3, tpa, for, the, ivy, mike, design, and, 1, 400, 10, 6, bar, 140, tpa, for, the, w, 80, foam, plasma, pressure, is, the, concept, that, chuck, hansen, introduced, during, the, progressive, case, based, on, research, that, located, declassified, documents, listing, special, foams, as, liner, components, within, the, radiation, case, of, thermonuclear, weapons, the, sequence, of, firing, the, weapon, with, the, foam, would, be, as, follows, this, would, complete, the, fission, fusion, fission, sequence, fusion, unlike, fission, is, relatively, clean, it, releases, energy, but, no, harmful, radioactive, products, or, large, amounts, of, nuclear, fallout, the, fission, reactions, though, especially, the, last, fission, reactions, release, a, tremendous, amount, of, fission, products, and, fallout, if, the, last, fission, stage, is, omitted, by, replacing, the, uranium, tamper, with, one, made, of, lead, for, example, the, overall, explosive, force, is, reduced, by, approximately, half, but, the, amount, of, fallout, is, relatively, low, the, neutron, bomb, is, a, hydrogen, bomb, with, an, intentionally, thin, tamper, allowing, as, many, of, the, fast, fusion, neutrons, as, possible, to, escape, current, technical, criticisms, of, the, idea, of, foam, plasma, pressure, focus, on, unclassified, analysis, from, similar, high, energy, physics, fields, that, indicate, that, the, pressure, produced, by, such, a, plasma, would, only, be, a, small, multiplier, of, the, basic, photon, pressure, within, the, radiation, case, and, also, that, the, known, foam, materials, intrinsically, have, a, very, low, absorption, efficiency, of, the, gamma, ray, and, x, ray, radiation, from, the, primary, most, of, the, energy, produced, would, be, absorbed, by, either, the, walls, of, the, radiation, case, or, the, tamper, around, the, secondary, analyzing, the, effects, of, that, absorbed, energy, led, to, the, third, mechanism, ablation, the, outer, casing, of, the, secondary, assembly, is, called, the, tamper, pusher, the, purpose, of, a, tamper, in, an, implosion, bomb, is, to, delay, the, expansion, of, the, reacting, fuel, supply, which, is, very, hot, dense, plasma, until, the, fuel, is, fully, consumed, and, the, explosion, runs, to, completion, the, same, tamper, material, serves, also, as, a, pusher, in, that, it, is, the, medium, by, which, the, outside, pressure, force, acting, on, the, surface, area, of, the, secondary, is, transferred, to, the, mass, of, fusion, fuel, the, proposed, tamper, pusher, ablation, mechanism, posits, that, the, outer, layers, of, the, thermonuclear, secondary, s, tamper, pusher, are, heated, so, extremely, by, the, primary, s, x, ray, flux, that, they, expand, violently, and, ablate, away, fly, off, because, total, momentum, is, conserved, this, mass, of, high, velocity, ejecta, impels, the, rest, of, the, tamper, pusher, to, recoil, inwards, with, tremendous, force, crushing, the, fusion, fuel, and, the, spark, plug, the, tamper, pusher, is, built, robustly, enough, to, insulate, the, fusion, fuel, from, the, extreme, heat, outside, otherwise, the, compression, would, be, spoiled, rough, calculations, for, the, basic, ablation, effect, are, relatively, simple, the, energy, from, the, primary, is, distributed, evenly, onto, all, of, the, surfaces, within, the, outer, radiation, case, with, the, components, coming, to, a, thermal, equilibrium, and, the, effects, of, that, thermal, energy, are, then, analyzed, the, energy, is, mostly, deposited, within, about, one, x, ray, optical, thickness, of, the, tamper, pusher, outer, surface, and, the, temperature, of, that, layer, can, then, be, calculated, the, velocity, at, which, the, surface, then, expands, outwards, is, calculated, and, from, a, basic, newtonian, momentum, balance, the, velocity, at, which, the, rest, of, the, tamper, implodes, inwards, applying, the, more, detailed, form, of, those, calculations, to, the, ivy, mike, device, yields, vaporized, pusher, gas, expansion, velocity, of, 290, kilometres, per, second, 180, mi, s, and, an, implosion, velocity, of, perhaps, 400, km, s, 250, mi, s, if, 3, 4, of, the, total, tamper, pusher, mass, is, ablated, off, the, most, energy, efficient, proportion, for, the, w, 80, the, gas, expansion, velocity, is, roughly, 410, km, s, 250, mi, s, and, the, implosion, velocity, 570, km, s, 350, mi, s, the, pressure, due, to, the, ablating, material, is, calculated, to, be, 5, 3, billion, bars, 530, trillion, pascals, in, the, ivy, mike, device, and, 64, billion, bars, 6, 4, quadrillion, pascals, in, the, w, 80, device, comparing, the, three, mechanisms, proposed, it, can, be, seen, that, the, calculated, ablation, pressure, is, one, order, of, magnitude, greater, than, the, higher, proposed, plasma, pressures, and, nearly, two, orders, of, magnitude, greater, than, calculated, radiation, pressure, no, mechanism, to, avoid, the, absorption, of, energy, into, the, radiation, case, wall, and, the, secondary, tamper, has, been, suggested, making, ablation, apparently, unavoidable, the, other, mechanisms, appear, to, be, unneeded, united, states, department, of, defense, official, declassification, reports, indicate, that, foamed, plastic, materials, are, or, may, be, used, in, radiation, case, liners, and, despite, the, low, direct, plasma, pressure, they, may, be, of, use, in, delaying, the, ablation, until, energy, has, distributed, evenly, and, a, sufficient, fraction, has, reached, the, secondary, s, tamper, pusher, richard, rhodes, book, dark, sun, stated, that, a, 1, inch, thick, 25, mm, layer, of, plastic, foam, was, fixed, to, the, lead, liner, of, the, inside, of, the, ivy, mike, steel, casing, using, copper, nails, rhodes, quotes, several, designers, of, that, bomb, explaining, that, the, plastic, foam, layer, inside, the, outer, case, is, to, delay, ablation, and, thus, recoil, of, the, outer, case, if, the, foam, were, not, there, metal, would, ablate, from, the, inside, of, the, outer, case, with, a, large, impulse, causing, the, casing, to, recoil, outwards, rapidly, the, purpose, of, the, casing, is, to, contain, the, explosion, for, as, long, as, possible, allowing, as, much, x, ray, ablation, of, the, metallic, surface, of, the, secondary, stage, as, possible, so, it, compresses, the, secondary, efficiently, maximizing, the, fusion, yield, plastic, foam, has, a, low, density, so, causes, a, smaller, impulse, when, it, ablates, than, metal, does, possible, variations, to, the, weapon, design, have, been, proposed, most, bombs, do, not, apparently, have, tertiary, stages, that, is, third, compression, stage, s, which, are, additional, fusion, stages, compressed, by, a, previous, fusion, stage, the, fissioning, of, the, last, blanket, of, uranium, which, provides, about, half, the, yield, in, large, bombs, does, not, count, as, a, stage, in, this, terminology, the, u, s, tested, three, stage, bombs, in, several, explosions, during, operation, redwing, but, is, thought, to, have, fielded, only, one, such, tertiary, model, i, e, a, bomb, in, which, a, fission, stage, followed, by, a, fusion, stage, finally, compresses, yet, another, fusion, stage, this, u, s, design, was, the, heavy, but, highly, efficient, i, e, nuclear, weapon, yield, per, unit, bomb, weight, 25, mt, 100, pj, b41, nuclear, bomb, the, soviet, union, is, thought, to, have, used, multiple, stages, including, more, than, one, tertiary, fusion, stage, in, their, 50, mt, 210, pj, 100, mt, 420, pj, in, intended, use, tsar, bomba, the, fissionable, jacket, could, be, replaced, with, lead, as, was, done, with, the, tsar, bomba, if, any, hydrogen, bombs, have, been, made, from, configurations, other, than, those, based, on, the, teller, ulam, design, the, fact, of, it, is, not, publicly, known, a, possible, exception, to, this, is, the, soviet, early, sloika, design, in, essence, the, teller, ulam, configuration, relies, on, at, least, two, instances, of, implosion, occurring, first, the, conventional, chemical, explosives, in, the, primary, would, compress, the, fissile, core, resulting, in, a, fission, explosion, many, times, more, powerful, than, that, which, chemical, explosives, could, achieve, alone, first, stage, second, the, radiation, from, the, fissioning, of, the, primary, would, be, used, to, compress, and, ignite, the, secondary, fusion, stage, resulting, in, a, fusion, explosion, many, times, more, powerful, than, the, fission, explosion, alone, this, chain, of, compression, could, conceivably, be, continued, with, an, arbitrary, number, of, tertiary, fusion, stages, each, igniting, more, fusion, fuel, in, the, next, stage, 192, 193, although, this, is, debated, finally, efficient, bombs, but, not, so, called, neutron, bombs, end, with, the, fissioning, of, the, final, natural, uranium, tamper, something, that, could, not, normally, be, achieved, without, the, neutron, flux, provided, by, the, fusion, reactions, in, secondary, or, tertiary, stages, such, designs, are, suggested, to, be, capable, of, being, scaled, up, to, an, arbitrary, large, yield, with, apparently, as, many, fusion, stages, as, desired, 192, 193, potentially, to, the, level, of, a, doomsday, device, however, usually, such, weapons, were, not, more, than, a, dozen, megatons, which, was, generally, considered, enough, to, destroy, even, the, most, hardened, practical, targets, for, example, a, control, facility, such, as, the, cheyenne, mountain, complex, even, such, large, bombs, have, been, replaced, by, smaller, yield, nuclear, bunker, buster, bombs, for, destruction, of, cities, and, non, hardened, targets, breaking, the, mass, of, a, single, missile, payload, down, into, smaller, mirv, bombs, in, order, to, spread, the, energy, of, the, explosions, into, a, pancake, area, is, far, more, efficient, in, terms, of, area, destruction, per, unit, of, bomb, energy, this, also, applies, to, single, bombs, deliverable, by, cruise, missile, or, other, system, such, as, a, bomber, resulting, in, most, operational, warheads, in, the, u, s, program, having, yields, of, less, than, 500, kt, 2, 100, tj, in, his, 1995, book, dark, sun, the, making, of, the, hydrogen, bomb, author, richard, rhodes, describes, in, detail, the, internal, components, of, the, ivy, mike, sausage, device, based, on, information, obtained, from, extensive, interviews, with, the, scientists, and, engineers, who, assembled, it, according, to, rhodes, the, actual, mechanism, for, the, compression, of, the, secondary, was, a, combination, of, the, radiation, pressure, foam, plasma, pressure, and, tamper, pusher, ablation, theories, the, radiation, from, the, primary, heated, the, polyethylene, foam, lining, of, the, casing, to, a, plasma, which, then, re, radiated, radiation, into, the, secondary, s, pusher, causing, its, surface, to, ablate, and, driving, it, inwards, compressing, the, secondary, igniting, the, sparkplug, and, causing, the, fusion, reaction, the, general, applicability, of, this, principle, is, unclear, in, 1999, a, reporter, for, the, san, jose, mercury, news, reported, that, the, u, s, w88, nuclear, warhead, a, small, mirved, warhead, used, on, the, trident, ii, slbm, had, a, prolate, primary, code, named, komodo, and, a, spherical, secondary, code, named, cursa, inside, a, specially, shaped, radiation, case, known, as, the, peanut, for, its, shape, the, value, of, an, egg, shaped, primary, lies, apparently, in, the, fact, that, a, mirv, warhead, is, limited, by, the, diameter, of, the, primary, if, an, egg, shaped, primary, can, be, made, to, work, properly, then, the, mirv, warhead, can, be, made, considerably, smaller, yet, still, deliver, a, high, yield, explosion, a, w88, warhead, manages, to, yield, up, to, 475, kilotonnes, of, tnt, 1, 990, tj, with, a, physics, package, 68, 9, inches, 1, 750, mm, long, with, a, maximum, diameter, of, 21, 8, inches, 550, mm, and, by, different, estimates, weighing, in, a, range, from, 175, to, 360, kilograms, 386, to, 794, lb, the, smaller, warhead, allows, more, of, them, to, fit, onto, a, single, missile, and, improves, basic, flight, properties, such, as, speed, and, range, the, idea, of, a, thermonuclear, fusion, bomb, ignited, by, a, smaller, fission, bomb, was, first, proposed, by, enrico, fermi, to, his, colleague, edward, teller, when, they, were, talking, at, columbia, university, in, september, 1941, 207, at, the, start, of, what, would, become, the, manhattan, project, teller, spent, much, of, the, manhattan, project, attempting, to, figure, out, how, to, make, the, design, work, preferring, it, over, work, on, the, atomic, bomb, and, over, the, last, year, of, the, project, he, was, assigned, exclusively, to, the, task, 117, 248, however, once, world, war, ii, ended, there, was, little, impetus, to, devote, many, resources, to, the, super, as, it, was, then, known, 202, the, first, atomic, bomb, test, by, the, soviet, union, in, august, 1949, came, earlier, than, expected, by, americans, and, over, the, next, several, months, there, was, an, intense, debate, within, the, u, s, government, military, and, scientific, communities, regarding, whether, to, proceed, with, development, of, the, far, more, powerful, super, 1, 2, the, debate, covered, matters, that, were, alternatively, strategic, pragmatic, and, moral, 16, in, their, report, of, the, general, advisory, committee, robert, oppenheimer, and, colleagues, concluded, that, he, extreme, danger, to, mankind, inherent, in, the, proposal, wholly, outweighs, any, military, advantage, despite, the, objections, raised, on, 31, january, 1950, president, harry, s, truman, made, the, decision, to, go, forward, with, the, development, of, the, new, weapon, 212, 214, teller, and, other, u, s, physicists, struggled, to, find, a, workable, design, 91, 92, stanislaw, ulam, a, co, worker, of, teller, made, the, first, key, conceptual, leaps, towards, a, workable, fusion, design, ulam, s, two, innovations, that, rendered, the, fusion, bomb, practical, were, that, compression, of, the, thermonuclear, fuel, before, extreme, heating, was, a, practical, path, towards, the, conditions, needed, for, fusion, and, the, idea, of, staging, or, placing, a, separate, thermonuclear, component, outside, a, fission, primary, component, and, somehow, using, the, primary, to, compress, the, secondary, teller, then, realized, that, the, gamma, and, x, ray, radiation, produced, in, the, primary, could, transfer, enough, energy, into, the, secondary, to, create, a, successful, implosion, and, fusion, burn, if, the, whole, assembly, was, wrapped, in, a, hohlraum, or, radiation, case, the, george, shot, of, operation, greenhouse, of, 9, may, 1951, tested, the, basic, concept, for, the, first, time, on, a, very, small, scale, as, the, first, successful, uncontrolled, release, of, nuclear, fusion, energy, which, made, up, a, small, fraction, of, the, 225, kt, 940, tj, total, yield, it, raised, expectations, to, a, near, certainty, that, the, concept, would, work, on, 1, november, 1952, the, teller, ulam, configuration, was, tested, at, full, scale, in, the, ivy, mike, shot, at, an, island, in, the, enewetak, atoll, with, a, yield, of, 10, 4, mt, 44, pj, over, 450, times, more, powerful, than, the, bomb, dropped, on, nagasaki, during, world, war, ii, the, device, dubbed, the, sausage, used, an, extra, large, fission, bomb, as, a, trigger, and, liquid, deuterium, kept, in, its, liquid, state, by, 20, short, tons, 18, t, of, cryogenic, equipment, as, its, fusion, fuel, and, weighed, around, 80, short, tons, 73, t, altogether, the, liquid, deuterium, fuel, of, ivy, mike, was, impractical, for, a, deployable, weapon, and, the, next, advance, was, to, use, a, solid, lithium, deuteride, fusion, fuel, instead, in, 1954, this, was, tested, in, the, castle, bravo, shot, the, device, was, code, named, shrimp, which, had, a, yield, of, 15, mt, 63, pj, 2, 5, times, expected, and, is, the, largest, u, s, bomb, ever, tested, efforts, shifted, towards, developing, miniaturized, teller, ulam, weapons, that, could, fit, into, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, and, submarine, launched, ballistic, missiles, by, 1960, with, the, w47, warhead, deployed, on, polaris, ballistic, missile, submarines, megaton, class, warheads, were, as, small, as, 18, inches, 0, 46, m, in, diameter, and, 720, pounds, 330, kg, in, weight, further, innovation, in, miniaturizing, warheads, was, accomplished, by, the, mid, 1970s, when, versions, of, the, teller, ulam, design, were, created, that, could, fit, ten, or, more, warheads, on, the, end, of, a, small, mirved, missile, the, first, soviet, fusion, design, developed, by, andrei, sakharov, and, vitaly, ginzburg, in, 1949, before, the, soviets, had, a, working, fission, bomb, was, dubbed, the, sloika, after, a, russian, layer, cake, and, was, not, of, the, teller, ulam, configuration, it, used, alternating, layers, of, fissile, material, and, lithium, deuteride, fusion, fuel, spiked, with, tritium, this, was, later, dubbed, sakharov, s, first, idea, though, nuclear, fusion, might, have, been, technically, achievable, it, did, not, have, the, scaling, property, of, a, staged, weapon, thus, such, a, design, could, not, produce, thermonuclear, weapons, whose, explosive, yields, could, be, made, arbitrarily, large, unlike, u, s, designs, at, that, time, the, fusion, layer, wrapped, around, the, fission, core, could, only, moderately, multiply, the, fission, energy, modern, teller, ulam, designs, can, multiply, it, 30, fold, additionally, the, whole, fusion, stage, had, to, be, imploded, by, conventional, explosives, along, with, the, fission, core, substantially, increasing, the, amount, of, chemical, explosives, needed, the, first, sloika, design, test, rds, 6s, was, detonated, in, 1953, with, a, yield, equivalent, to, 400, kt, 1, 700, tj, 15, 20, from, fusion, attempts, to, use, a, sloika, design, to, achieve, megaton, range, results, proved, unfeasible, after, the, united, states, tested, the, ivy, mike, thermonuclear, device, in, november, 1952, proving, that, a, multimegaton, bomb, could, be, created, the, soviets, searched, for, an, alternative, design, the, second, idea, as, sakharov, referred, to, it, in, his, memoirs, was, a, previous, proposal, by, ginzburg, in, november, 1948, to, use, lithium, deuteride, in, the, bomb, which, would, in, the, course, of, being, bombarded, by, neutrons, produce, tritium, and, free, deuterium, 299, in, late, 1953, physicist, viktor, davidenko, achieved, the, first, breakthrough, of, staging, the, reaactions, the, next, breakthrough, of, radiation, implosion, was, discovered, and, developed, by, sakharov, and, yakov, zel, dovich, in, early, 1954, sakharov, s, third, idea, as, the, teller, ulam, design, was, known, in, the, ussr, was, tested, in, the, shot, rds, 37, in, november, 1955, with, a, yield, of, 1, 6, mt, 6, 7, pj, the, soviets, demonstrated, the, power, of, the, staging, concept, in, october, 1961, when, they, detonated, the, massive, and, unwieldy, tsar, bomba, it, was, the, largest, nuclear, weapon, developed, and, tested, by, any, country, in, 1954, work, began, at, aldermaston, to, develop, the, british, fusion, bomb, with, sir, william, penney, in, charge, of, the, project, british, knowledge, on, how, to, make, a, thermonuclear, fusion, bomb, was, rudimentary, and, at, the, time, the, united, states, was, not, exchanging, any, nuclear, knowledge, because, of, the, atomic, energy, act, of, 1946, the, united, kingdom, had, worked, closely, with, the, americans, on, the, manhattan, project, british, access, to, nuclear, weapons, information, was, cut, off, by, the, united, states, at, one, point, due, to, concerns, about, soviet, espionage, full, cooperation, was, not, reestablished, until, an, agreement, governing, the, handling, of, secret, information, and, other, issues, was, signed, however, the, british, were, allowed, to, observe, the, u, s, castle, tests, and, used, sampling, aircraft, in, the, mushroom, clouds, providing, them, with, clear, direct, evidence, of, the, compression, produced, in, the, secondary, stages, by, radiation, implosion, because, of, these, difficulties, in, 1955, prime, minister, anthony, eden, agreed, to, a, secret, plan, whereby, if, the, aldermaston, scientists, failed, or, were, greatly, delayed, in, developing, the, fusion, bomb, it, would, be, replaced, by, an, extremely, large, fission, bomb, in, 1957, the, operation, grapple, tests, were, carried, out, the, first, test, green, granite, was, a, prototype, fusion, bomb, that, failed, to, produce, equivalent, yields, compared, to, the, u, s, and, soviets, achieving, only, approximately, 300, kt, 1, 300, tj, the, second, test, orange, herald, was, the, modified, fission, bomb, and, produced, 720, kt, 3, 000, tj, making, it, the, largest, fission, explosion, ever, at, the, time, almost, everyone, including, the, pilots, of, the, plane, that, dropped, it, thought, that, this, was, a, fusion, bomb, this, bomb, was, put, into, service, in, 1958, a, second, prototype, fusion, bomb, purple, granite, was, used, in, the, third, test, but, only, produced, approximately, 150, kt, 630, tj, a, second, set, of, tests, was, scheduled, with, testing, recommencing, in, september, 1957, the, first, test, was, based, on, a, new, simpler, design, a, two, stage, thermonuclear, bomb, that, had, a, much, more, powerful, trigger, this, test, grapple, x, round, c, was, exploded, on, 8, november, and, yielded, approximately, 1, 8, mt, 7, 5, pj, on, 28, april, 1958, a, bomb, was, dropped, that, yielded, 3, mt, 13, pj, britain, s, most, powerful, test, two, final, air, burst, tests, on, 2, and, 11, september, 1958, dropped, smaller, bombs, that, yielded, around, 1, mt, 4, 2, pj, each, american, observers, had, been, invited, to, these, kinds, of, tests, after, britain, s, successful, detonation, of, a, megaton, range, device, and, thus, demonstrating, a, practical, understanding, of, the, teller, ulam, design, secret, the, united, states, agreed, to, exchange, some, of, its, nuclear, designs, with, the, united, kingdom, leading, to, the, 1958, us, uk, mutual, defence, agreement, instead, of, continuing, with, its, own, design, the, british, were, given, access, to, the, design, of, the, smaller, american, mk, 28, warhead, and, were, able, to, manufacture, copies, mao, zedong, decided, to, begin, a, chinese, nuclear, weapons, program, during, the, first, taiwan, strait, crisis, of, 1954, 1955, the, people, s, republic, of, china, detonated, its, first, thermonuclear, bomb, on, 17, june, 1967, 32, months, after, detonating, its, first, fission, weapon, with, a, yield, of, 3, 31, mt, it, took, place, in, the, lop, nor, test, site, in, northwest, china, china, had, received, extensive, technical, help, from, the, soviet, union, to, jump, start, their, nuclear, program, but, by, 1960, the, rift, between, the, soviet, union, and, china, had, become, so, great, that, the, soviet, union, ceased, all, assistance, to, china, a, story, in, the, new, york, times, by, william, broad, reported, that, in, 1995, a, supposed, chinese, double, agent, delivered, information, indicating, that, china, knew, secret, details, of, the, u, s, w88, warhead, supposedly, through, espionage, this, line, of, investigation, eventually, resulted, in, the, abortive, trial, of, wen, ho, lee, the, canopus, test, in, the, fangataufa, atoll, in, french, polynesia, on, 24, august, 1968, was, the, country, s, first, multistage, thermonuclear, weapon, test, the, bomb, was, detonated, from, a, balloon, at, a, height, of, 520, metres, 1, 710, ft, the, result, of, this, test, was, significant, atmospheric, contamination, very, little, is, known, about, france, s, development, of, the, teller, ulam, design, beyond, the, fact, that, france, detonated, a, 2, 6, mt, 11, pj, device, in, the, canopus, test, france, reportedly, had, great, difficulty, with, its, initial, development, of, the, teller, ulam, design, but, it, later, overcame, these, and, is, believed, to, have, nuclear, weapons, equal, in, sophistication, to, the, other, major, nuclear, powers, france, and, china, did, not, sign, or, ratify, the, partial, nuclear, test, ban, treaty, of, 1963, which, banned, nuclear, test, explosions, in, the, atmosphere, underwater, or, in, outer, space, between, 1966, and, 1996, france, carried, out, more, than, 190, nuclear, tests, france, s, final, nuclear, test, took, place, on, 27, january, 1996, and, then, the, country, dismantled, its, polynesian, test, sites, france, signed, the, comprehensive, nuclear, test, ban, treaty, that, same, year, and, then, ratified, the, treaty, within, two, years, in, 2015, france, confirmed, that, its, nuclear, arsenal, contains, about, 300, warheads, carried, by, submarine, launched, ballistic, missiles, and, fighter, bombers, france, has, four, triomphant, class, ballistic, missile, submarines, one, ballistic, missile, submarine, is, deployed, in, the, deep, ocean, but, a, total, of, three, must, be, in, operational, use, at, all, times, the, three, older, submarines, are, armed, with, 16, m45, missiles, the, newest, submarine, le, terrible, was, commissioned, in, 2010, and, it, has, m51, missiles, capable, of, carrying, tn, 75, thermonuclear, warheads, the, air, fleet, is, four, squadrons, at, four, different, bases, in, total, there, are, 23, mirage, 2000n, aircraft, and, 20, rafales, capable, of, carrying, nuclear, warheads, the, m51, 1, missiles, are, intended, to, be, replaced, with, the, new, m51, 2, warhead, beginning, in, 2016, which, has, a, 3, 000, kilometres, 1, 900, mi, greater, range, than, the, m51, 1, france, has, about, 60, air, launched, missiles, tipped, with, tn, 80, tn, 81, warheads, with, a, yield, of, about, 300, kt, 1, 300, tj, each, france, s, nuclear, program, has, been, carefully, designed, to, ensure, that, these, weapons, remain, usable, decades, into, the, future, currently, france, is, no, longer, deliberately, producing, critical, mass, materials, such, as, plutonium, and, enriched, uranium, but, it, still, relies, on, nuclear, energy, for, electricity, with, 239, pu, as, a, byproduct, on, 11, may, 1998, india, announced, that, it, had, detonated, a, thermonuclear, bomb, in, its, operation, shakti, tests, shakti, i, specifically, in, hindi, the, word, shakti, means, power, samar, mubarakmand, a, pakistani, nuclear, physicist, asserted, that, if, shakti, i, had, been, a, thermonuclear, test, the, device, had, failed, to, fire, however, harold, m, agnew, former, director, of, the, los, alamos, national, laboratory, said, that, india, s, assertion, of, having, detonated, a, staged, thermonuclear, bomb, was, believable, india, says, that, their, thermonuclear, device, was, tested, at, a, controlled, yield, of, 45, kt, 190, tj, because, of, the, close, proximity, of, the, khetolai, village, at, about, 5, kilometres, 3, 1, mi, to, ensure, that, the, houses, in, that, village, do, not, suffer, significant, damage, another, cited, reason, was, that, radioactivity, released, from, yields, significantly, more, than, 45, kt, might, not, have, been, contained, fully, after, the, pokhran, ii, tests, rajagopala, chidambaram, former, chairman, of, the, atomic, energy, commission, of, india, said, that, india, has, the, capability, to, build, thermonuclear, bombs, of, any, yield, at, will, india, officially, maintains, that, it, can, build, thermonuclear, weapons, of, various, yields, up, to, around, 200, kt, 840, tj, on, the, basis, of, the, shakti, 1, thermonuclear, test, the, yield, of, india, s, hydrogen, bomb, test, remains, highly, debatable, among, the, indian, science, community, and, the, international, scholars, the, question, of, politicisation, and, disputes, between, indian, scientists, further, complicated, the, matter, in, an, interview, in, august, 2009, the, director, for, the, 1998, test, site, preparations, k, santhanam, claimed, that, the, yield, of, the, thermonuclear, explosion, was, lower, than, expected, and, that, india, should, therefore, not, rush, into, signing, the, comprehensive, nuclear, test, ban, treaty, other, indian, scientists, involved, in, the, test, have, disputed, santhanam, s, claim, arguing, that, his, claims, are, unscientific, british, seismologist, roger, clarke, argued, that, the, magnitudes, suggested, a, combined, yield, of, up, to, 60, kilotonnes, of, tnt, 250, tj, consistent, with, the, indian, announced, total, yield, of, 56, kilotonnes, of, tnt, 230, tj, u, s, seismologist, jack, evernden, has, argued, that, for, correct, estimation, of, yields, one, should, account, properly, for, geological, and, seismological, differences, between, test, sites, israel, is, alleged, to, possess, thermonuclear, weapons, of, the, teller, ulam, design, but, it, is, not, known, to, have, tested, any, nuclear, devices, although, it, is, widely, speculated, that, the, vela, incident, of, 1979, may, have, been, a, joint, israeli, south, african, nuclear, test, 271, 297, 300, it, is, well, established, that, edward, teller, advised, and, guided, the, israeli, establishment, on, general, nuclear, matters, for, some, 20, years, 289, 293, between, 1964, and, 1967, teller, made, six, visits, to, israel, where, he, lectured, at, the, tel, aviv, university, on, general, topics, in, theoretical, physics, it, took, him, a, year, to, convince, the, cia, about, israel, s, capability, and, finally, in, 1976, carl, duckett, of, the, cia, testified, to, the, u, s, congress, after, receiving, credible, information, from, an, american, scientist, teller, on, israel, s, nuclear, capability, 297, 300, during, the, 1990s, teller, eventually, confirmed, speculations, in, the, media, that, it, was, during, his, visits, in, the, 1960s, that, he, concluded, that, israel, was, in, possession, of, nuclear, weapons, 297, 300, after, he, conveyed, the, matter, to, the, higher, level, of, the, u, s, government, teller, reportedly, said, they, have, it, and, they, were, clever, enough, to, trust, their, research, and, not, to, test, they, know, that, to, test, would, get, them, into, trouble, 297, 300, north, korea, claimed, to, have, tested, its, miniaturised, thermonuclear, bomb, on, 6, january, 2016, north, korea, s, first, three, nuclear, tests, 2006, 2009, and, 2013, were, relatively, low, yield, and, do, not, appear, to, have, been, of, a, thermonuclear, weapon, design, in, 2013, the, south, korean, defense, ministry, speculated, that, north, korea, may, be, trying, to, develop, a, hydrogen, bomb, and, such, a, device, may, be, north, korea, s, next, weapons, test, in, january, 2016, north, korea, claimed, to, have, successfully, tested, a, hydrogen, bomb, although, only, a, magnitude, 5, 1, seismic, event, was, detected, at, the, time, of, the, test, a, similar, magnitude, to, the, 2013, test, of, a, 6, 9, kt, 25, 38, tj, atomic, bomb, these, seismic, recordings, cast, doubt, upon, north, korea, s, claim, that, a, hydrogen, bomb, was, tested, and, suggest, it, was, a, non, fusion, nuclear, test, on, 3, september, 2017, the, country, s, state, media, reported, that, a, hydrogen, bomb, test, was, conducted, that, resulted, in, perfect, success, according, to, the, u, s, geological, survey, usgs, the, blast, released, energy, equivalent, to, an, earthquake, with, a, seismic, magnitude, of, 6, 3, 10, times, more, powerful, than, previous, nuclear, tests, conducted, by, north, korea, u, s, intelligence, released, an, early, assessment, that, the, yield, estimate, was, 140, kt, 590, tj, with, an,

even, today, it, is, not, discussed, in, any, detail, by, official, publications, with, origins, behind, the, fence, of, classification, united, states, department, of, energy, doe, policy, has, been, and, continues, to, be, that, they, do, not, acknowledge, when, leaks, occur, because, doing, so, would, acknowledge, the, accuracy, of, the, supposed, leaked, information, aside, from, images, of, the, warhead, casing, most, information, in, the, public, domain, about, this, design, is, relegated, to, a, few, terse, statements, by, the, doe, and, the, work, of, a, few, individual, investigators, in, 1972, the, united, states, government, declassified, a, document, stating, n, thermonuclear, tn, weapons, a, fission, primary, is, used, to, trigger, a, tn, reaction, in, thermonuclear, fuel, referred, to, as, a, secondary, and, in, 1979, added, n, thermonuclear, weapons, radiation, from, a, fission, explosive, can, be, contained, and, used, to, transfer, energy, to, compress, and, ignite, a, physically, separate, component, containing, thermonuclear, fuel, to, this, latter, sentence, the, us, government, specified, that, any, elaboration, of, this, statement, will, be, classified, the, only, information, that, may, pertain, to, the, spark, plug, was, declassified, in, 1991, fact, that, fissile, or, fissionable, materials, are, present, in, some, secondaries, material, unidentified, location, unspecified, use, unspecified, and, weapons, undesignated, in, 1998, the, doe, declassified, the, statement, that, the, fact, that, materials, may, be, present, in, channels, and, the, term, channel, filler, with, no, elaboration, which, may, refer, to, the, polystyrene, foam, or, an, analogous, substance, whether, these, statements, vindicate, some, or, all, of, the, models, presented, above, is, up, for, interpretation, and, official, u, s, government, releases, about, the, technical, details, of, nuclear, weapons, have, been, purposely, equivocating, in, the, past, e, g, smyth, report, other, information, such, as, the, types, of, fuel, used, in, some, of, the, early, weapons, has, been, declassified, though, precise, technical, information, has, not, been, most, of, the, current, ideas, on, the, workings, of, the, teller, ulam, design, came, into, public, awareness, after, the, doe, attempted, to, censor, a, magazine, article, by, u, s, anti, weapons, activist, howard, morland, in, 1979, on, the, secret, of, the, hydrogen, bomb, in, 1978, morland, had, decided, that, discovering, and, exposing, this, last, remaining, secret, would, focus, attention, onto, the, arms, race, and, allow, citizens, to, feel, empowered, to, question, official, statements, on, the, importance, of, nuclear, weapons, and, nuclear, secrecy, most, of, morland, s, ideas, about, how, the, weapon, worked, were, compiled, from, accessible, sources, the, drawings, that, most, inspired, his, approach, came, from, the, encyclopedia, americana, morland, also, interviewed, often, informally, many, former, los, alamos, scientists, including, teller, and, ulam, though, neither, gave, him, any, useful, information, and, he, used, a, variety, of, interpersonal, strategies, to, encourage, informative, responses, from, them, i, e, asking, questions, such, as, do, they, still, use, spark, plugs, even, if, he, was, not, aware, what, the, latter, term, specifically, referred, to, morland, eventually, concluded, that, the, secret, was, that, the, primary, and, secondary, were, kept, separate, and, that, radiation, pressure, from, the, primary, compressed, the, secondary, before, igniting, it, when, an, early, draft, of, the, article, to, be, published, in, the, progressive, magazine, was, sent, to, the, doe, after, falling, into, the, hands, of, a, professor, who, was, opposed, to, morland, s, goal, the, doe, requested, that, the, article, not, be, published, and, pressed, for, a, temporary, injunction, the, doe, argued, that, morland, s, information, was, 1, likely, derived, from, classified, sources, 2, if, not, derived, from, classified, sources, itself, counted, as, secret, information, under, the, born, secret, clause, of, the, 1954, atomic, energy, act, and, 3, was, dangerous, and, would, encourage, nuclear, proliferation, morland, and, his, lawyers, disagreed, on, all, points, but, the, injunction, was, granted, as, the, judge, in, the, case, felt, that, it, was, safer, to, grant, the, injunction, and, allow, morland, et, al, to, appeal, through, a, variety, of, more, complicated, circumstances, the, doe, case, began, to, wane, as, it, became, clear, that, some, of, the, data, they, were, attempting, to, claim, as, secret, had, been, published, in, a, students, encyclopedia, a, few, years, earlier, after, another, h, bomb, speculator, chuck, hansen, had, his, own, ideas, about, the, secret, quite, different, from, morland, s, published, in, a, wisconsin, newspaper, the, doe, claimed, that, the, progressive, case, was, moot, dropped, its, suit, and, allowed, the, magazine, to, publish, its, article, which, it, did, in, november, 1979, morland, had, by, then, however, changed, his, opinion, of, how, the, bomb, worked, suggesting, that, a, foam, medium, the, polystyrene, rather, than, radiation, pressure, was, used, to, compress, the, secondary, and, that, in, the, secondary, there, was, a, spark, plug, of, fissile, material, as, well, he, published, these, changes, based, in, part, on, the, proceedings, of, the, appeals, trial, as, a, short, erratum, in, the, progressive, a, month, later, in, 1981, morland, published, a, book, about, his, experience, describing, in, detail, the, train, of, thought, that, led, him, to, his, conclusions, about, the, secret, morland, s, work, is, interpreted, as, being, at, least, partially, correct, because, the, doe, had, sought, to, censor, it, one, of, the, few, times, they, violated, their, usual, approach, of, not, acknowledging, secret, material, that, had, been, released, however, to, what, degree, it, lacks, information, or, has, incorrect, information, is, not, known, with, any, confidence, the, difficulty, that, other, countries, had, in, developing, the, teller, ulam, design, even, when, they, apparently, understood, the, design, such, as, with, the, united, kingdom, makes, it, somewhat, unlikely, that, this, simple, information, alone, is, what, provides, the, ability, to, manufacture, thermonuclear, weapons, nevertheless, the, ideas, put, forward, by, morland, in, 1979, have, been, the, basis, for, all, the, current, speculation, on, the, teller, ulam, design, on, 5, february, 1958, during, a, training, mission, flown, by, a, b, 47, a, mark, 15, nuclear, bomb, also, known, as, the, tybee, bomb, was, lost, off, the, coast, of, tybee, island, near, savannah, georgia, the, us, air, force, maintains, that, the, bomb, was, unarmed, and, did, not, contain, the, live, plutonium, core, necessary, to, initiate, a, nuclear, explosion, the, bomb, was, thought, by, the, department, of, energy, to, lie, buried, under, several, feet, of, silt, at, the, bottom, of, wassaw, sound, on, 17, january, 1966, a, fatal, collision, occurred, between, a, b, 52g, and, a, kc, 135, stratotanker, over, palomares, spain, the, conventional, explosives, in, two, of, the, mk28, type, hydrogen, bombs, detonated, upon, impact, with, the, ground, dispersing, plutonium, over, nearby, farms, a, third, bomb, landed, intact, near, palomares, while, the, fourth, fell, 12, miles, 19, km, off, the, coast, into, the, mediterranean, sea, and, was, recovered, a, few, months, later, on, 21, january, 1968, a, b, 52g, with, four, b28fi, thermonuclear, bombs, aboard, as, part, of, operation, chrome, dome,
