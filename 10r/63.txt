open, source, software, oss, is, computer, software, that, is, released, under, a, license, in, which, the, copyright, holder, grants, users, the, rights, to, use, study, change, and, distribute, the, software, and, its, source, code, to, anyone, and, for, any, purpose, open, source, software, may, be, developed, in, a, collaborative, public, manner, open, source, software, is, a, prominent, example, of, open, collaboration, meaning, any, capable, user, is, able, to, participate, online, in, development, making, the, number, of, possible, contributors, indefinite, the, ability, to, examine, the, code, facilitates, public, trust, in, the, software, open, source, software, development, can, bring, in, diverse, perspectives, beyond, those, of, a, single, company, a, 2024, estimate, of, the, value, of, open, source, software, to, firms, is, 8, 8, trillion, as, firms, would, need, to, spend, 3, 5, times, the, amount, they, currently, do, without, the, use, of, open, source, software, open, source, code, can, be, used, for, studying, and, allows, capable, end, users, to, adapt, software, to, their, personal, needs, in, a, similar, way, user, scripts, and, custom, style, sheets, allow, for, web, sites, and, eventually, publish, the, modification, as, a, fork, for, users, with, similar, preferences, and, directly, submit, possible, improvements, as, pull, requests, the, open, source, initiative, s, osi, definition, is, recognized, by, several, governments, internationally, as, the, standard, or, de, facto, definition, osi, uses, the, open, source, definition, to, determine, whether, it, considers, a, software, license, open, source, the, definition, was, based, on, the, debian, free, software, guidelines, written, and, adapted, primarily, by, perens, perens, did, not, base, his, writing, on, the, four, freedoms, from, the, free, software, foundation, fsf, which, were, only, widely, available, later, under, perens, definition, open, source, is, a, broad, software, license, that, makes, source, code, available, to, the, general, public, with, relaxed, or, non, existent, restrictions, on, the, use, and, modification, of, the, code, it, is, an, explicit, feature, of, open, source, that, it, puts, very, few, restrictions, on, the, use, or, distribution, by, any, organization, or, user, in, order, to, enable, the, rapid, evolution, of, the, software, according, to, feller, et, al, 2005, the, terms, free, software, and, open, source, software, should, be, applied, to, any, software, products, distributed, under, terms, that, allow, users, to, use, modify, and, redistribute, the, software, in, any, manner, they, see, fit, without, requiring, that, they, pay, the, author, s, of, the, software, a, royalty, or, fee, for, engaging, in, the, listed, activities, despite, initially, accepting, it, richard, stallman, of, the, fsf, now, flatly, opposes, the, term, open, source, being, applied, to, what, they, refer, to, as, free, software, although, he, agrees, that, the, two, terms, describe, almost, the, same, category, of, software, stallman, considers, equating, the, terms, incorrect, and, misleading, stallman, also, opposes, the, professed, pragmatism, of, the, open, source, initiative, as, he, fears, that, the, free, software, ideals, of, freedom, and, community, are, threatened, by, compromising, on, the, fsf, s, idealistic, standards, for, software, freedom, the, fsf, considers, free, software, to, be, a, subset, of, open, source, software, and, richard, stallman, explained, that, drm, software, for, example, can, be, developed, as, open, source, despite, that, it, does, not, give, its, users, freedom, it, restricts, them, and, thus, does, not, qualify, as, free, software, in, his, 1997, essay, the, cathedral, and, the, bazaar, open, source, influential, contributor, eric, s, raymond, suggests, a, model, for, developing, oss, known, as, the, bazaar, model, raymond, likens, the, development, of, software, by, traditional, methodologies, to, building, a, cathedral, with, careful, isolated, work, by, individuals, or, small, groups, he, suggests, that, all, software, should, be, developed, using, the, bazaar, style, with, differing, agendas, and, approaches, in, the, traditional, model, of, development, which, he, called, the, cathedral, model, development, takes, place, in, a, centralized, way, roles, are, clearly, defined, roles, include, people, dedicated, to, designing, the, architects, people, responsible, for, managing, the, project, and, people, responsible, for, implementation, traditional, software, engineering, follows, the, cathedral, model, the, bazaar, model, however, is, different, in, this, model, roles, are, not, clearly, defined, some, proposed, characteristics, of, software, developed, using, the, bazaar, model, should, exhibit, the, following, patterns, users, should, be, treated, as, co, developers, the, users, are, treated, like, co, developers, and, so, they, should, have, access, to, the, source, code, of, the, software, furthermore, users, are, encouraged, to, submit, additions, to, the, software, code, fixes, for, the, software, bug, reports, documentation, etc, having, more, co, developers, increases, the, rate, at, which, the, software, evolves, linus, s, law, states, that, given, enough, eyeballs, all, bugs, are, shallow, this, means, that, if, many, users, view, the, source, code, they, will, eventually, find, all, bugs, and, suggest, how, to, fix, them, some, users, have, advanced, programming, skills, and, furthermore, each, user, s, machine, provides, an, additional, testing, environment, this, new, testing, environment, offers, the, ability, to, find, and, fix, a, new, bug, early, releases, the, first, version, of, the, software, should, be, released, as, early, as, possible, so, as, to, increase, one, s, chances, of, finding, co, developers, early, frequent, integration, code, changes, should, be, integrated, merged, into, a, shared, code, base, as, often, as, possible, so, as, to, avoid, the, overhead, of, fixing, a, large, number, of, bugs, at, the, end, of, the, project, life, cycle, some, open, source, projects, have, nightly, builds, where, integration, is, done, automatically, several, versions, there, should, be, at, least, two, versions, of, the, software, there, should, be, a, buggier, version, with, more, features, and, a, more, stable, version, with, fewer, features, the, buggy, version, also, called, the, development, version, is, for, users, who, want, the, immediate, use, of, the, latest, features, and, are, willing, to, accept, the, risk, of, using, code, that, is, not, yet, thoroughly, tested, the, users, can, then, act, as, co, developers, reporting, bugs, and, providing, bug, fixes, high, modularization, the, general, structure, of, the, software, should, be, modular, allowing, for, parallel, development, on, independent, components, dynamic, decision, making, structure, there, is, a, need, for, a, decision, making, structure, whether, formal, or, informal, that, makes, strategic, decisions, depending, on, changing, user, requirements, and, other, factors, compare, with, extreme, programming, the, process, of, open, source, development, begins, with, a, requirements, elicitation, where, developers, consider, if, they, should, add, new, features, or, if, a, bug, needs, to, be, fixed, in, their, project, this, is, established, by, communicating, with, the, oss, community, through, avenues, such, as, bug, reporting, and, tracking, or, mailing, lists, and, project, pages, next, oss, developers, select, or, are, assigned, to, a, task, and, identify, a, solution, because, there, are, often, many, different, possible, routes, for, solutions, in, oss, the, best, solution, must, be, chosen, with, careful, consideration, and, sometimes, even, peer, feedback, the, developer, then, begins, to, develop, and, commit, the, code, the, code, is, then, tested, and, reviewed, by, peers, developers, can, edit, and, evolve, their, code, through, feedback, from, continuous, integration, once, the, leadership, and, community, are, satisfied, with, the, whole, project, it, can, be, partially, released, and, user, instruction, can, be, documented, if, the, project, is, ready, to, be, released, it, is, frozen, with, only, serious, bug, fixes, or, security, repairs, occurring, finally, the, project, is, fully, released, and, only, changed, through, minor, bug, fixes, open, source, implementation, of, a, standard, can, increase, adoption, of, that, standard, this, creates, developer, loyalty, as, developers, feel, empowered, and, have, a, sense, of, ownership, of, the, end, product, moreover, lower, costs, of, marketing, and, logistical, services, are, needed, for, oss, oss, can, be, a, tool, to, promote, a, company, s, image, including, its, commercial, products, the, oss, development, approach, has, helped, produce, reliable, high, quality, software, quickly, and, inexpensively, open, source, development, offers, the, potential, to, quicken, innovation, and, create, of, social, value, in, france, for, instance, a, policy, that, incentivized, government, to, favor, free, open, source, software, increased, to, nearly, 600, 000, oss, contributions, per, year, generating, social, value, by, increasing, the, quantity, and, quality, of, open, source, software, this, policy, also, led, to, an, estimated, increase, of, up, to, 18, of, tech, startups, and, a, 14, increase, in, the, number, of, people, employed, in, the, it, sector, oss, can, be, highly, reliable, when, it, has, thousands, of, independent, programmers, testing, and, fixing, bugs, of, the, software, open, source, is, not, dependent, on, the, company, or, author, that, originally, created, it, even, if, the, company, fails, the, code, continues, to, exist, and, be, developed, by, its, users, oss, is, flexible, because, modular, systems, allow, programmers, to, build, custom, interfaces, or, add, new, abilities, to, it, and, it, is, innovative, since, open, source, programs, are, the, product, of, collaboration, among, a, large, number, of, different, programmers, the, mix, of, divergent, perspectives, corporate, objectives, and, personal, goals, speeds, up, innovation, moreover, free, software, can, be, developed, in, accordance, with, purely, technical, requirements, it, does, not, require, thinking, about, commercial, pressure, that, often, degrades, the, quality, of, the, software, commercial, pressures, make, traditional, software, developers, pay, more, attention, to, customers, requirements, than, to, security, requirements, since, such, features, are, somewhat, invisible, to, the, customer, in, open, source, software, development, tools, are, used, to, support, the, development, of, the, product, and, the, development, process, itself, version, control, systems, such, as, centralized, version, control, system, cvcs, and, the, distributed, version, control, system, dvcs, are, examples, of, tools, often, open, source, that, help, manage, the, source, code, files, and, the, changes, to, those, files, for, a, software, project, in, order, to, foster, collaboration, cvcs, are, centralized, with, a, central, repository, while, dvcs, are, decentralized, and, have, a, local, repository, for, every, user, concurrent, versions, system, cvs, and, later, subversion, svn, and, git, are, examples, of, cvcs, the, repositories, are, hosted, and, published, on, source, code, hosting, facilities, such, as, github, open, source, projects, use, utilities, such, as, issue, trackers, to, organize, open, source, software, development, commonly, used, bugtrackers, include, bugzilla, and, redmine, tools, such, as, mailing, lists, and, irc, provide, means, of, coordination, and, discussion, of, bugs, among, developers, project, web, pages, wiki, pages, roadmap, lists, and, newsgroups, allow, for, the, distribution, of, project, information, that, focuses, on, end, users, the, basic, roles, oss, participants, can, fall, into, multiple, categories, beginning, with, leadership, at, the, center, of, the, project, who, have, control, over, its, execution, next, are, the, core, contributors, with, a, great, deal, of, experience, and, authority, in, the, project, who, may, guide, the, other, contributors, non, core, contributors, have, less, experience, and, authority, but, regularly, contribute, and, are, vital, to, the, project, s, development, new, contributors, are, the, least, experienced, but, with, mentorship, and, guidance, can, become, regular, contributors, some, possible, ways, of, contributing, to, open, source, software, include, such, roles, as, programming, user, interface, design, and, testing, web, design, bug, triage, accessibility, design, and, testing, ux, design, code, testing, and, security, review, and, testing, however, there, are, several, ways, of, contributing, to, oss, projects, even, without, coding, skills, for, example, some, less, technical, ways, of, participating, are, documentation, writing, and, editing, translation, project, management, event, organization, and, coordination, marketing, release, management, community, management, and, public, relations, and, outreach, funding, is, absolutely, another, terrific, way, that, individuals, and, organizations, choose, to, contribute, to, open, source, projects, groups, like, open, collective, provide, a, means, for, individuals, to, contribute, monthly, to, supporting, their, favorite, projects, organizations, like, the, sovereign, tech, fund, is, able, to, contribute, to, millions, to, supporting, the, tools, the, german, government, uses, the, national, science, foundation, established, a, pathways, to, enable, open, source, ecosystems, pose, program, to, support, open, source, innovation, the, adoption, of, open, source, software, by, industry, is, increasing, over, time, oss, is, popular, in, several, industries, such, as, telecommunications, aerospace, healthcare, and, media, entertainment, due, to, the, benefits, it, provides, adoption, of, oss, is, more, likely, in, larger, organizations, and, is, dependent, on, the, company, s, it, usage, operating, efficiencies, and, the, productivity, of, employees, industries, are, likely, to, use, oss, due, to, back, office, functionality, sales, support, research, and, development, software, features, quick, deployment, portability, across, platforms, and, avoidance, of, commercial, license, management, additionally, lower, cost, for, hardware, and, ownership, are, also, important, benefits, organizations, that, contribute, to, the, development, and, expansions, of, free, and, open, source, software, movements, exist, all, over, the, world, these, organizations, are, dedicated, to, goals, such, as, teaching, and, spreading, technology, as, listed, by, a, former, vice, president, of, the, open, source, initiative, some, american, organizations, include, the, free, software, foundation, software, freedom, conservancy, the, open, source, initiative, and, software, in, the, public, interest, within, europe, some, notable, organizations, are, free, software, foundation, europe, open, source, projects, eu, osp, and, openforum, europe, ofe, one, australian, organization, is, linux, australia, while, asia, has, open, source, asia, and, fossasia, free, and, open, source, software, for, africa, fossfa, and, openafrica, are, african, organizations, and, central, and, south, asia, has, such, organizations, as, flisol, and, grup, de, usuarios, de, software, libre, peru, outside, of, these, many, more, organizations, dedicated, to, the, advancement, of, open, source, software, exist, foss, products, are, generally, licensed, under, two, types, of, licenses, permissive, licensing, and, copyleft, licensing, both, of, these, types, of, licenses, are, different, than, proprietary, licensing, in, that, they, can, allow, more, users, access, to, the, software, and, allow, for, the, creation, of, derivative, works, as, specified, by, the, terms, of, the, specific, license, as, each, license, has, its, own, rules, permissive, licenses, allow, recipients, of, the, software, to, implement, the, author, s, copyright, rights, without, having, to, use, the, same, license, for, distribution, examples, of, this, type, of, license, include, the, bsd, mit, and, apache, licenses, copyleft, licenses, are, different, in, that, they, require, recipients, to, use, the, same, license, for, at, least, some, parts, of, the, distribution, of, their, works, strong, copyleft, licenses, require, all, derivative, works, to, use, the, same, license, while, weak, copyleft, licenses, require, the, use, of, the, same, license, only, under, certain, conditions, examples, of, this, type, of, license, include, the, gnu, family, of, licenses, and, the, mpl, and, epl, licenses, the, similarities, between, these, two, categories, of, licensing, include, that, they, provide, a, broad, grant, of, copyright, rights, require, that, recipients, preserve, copyright, notices, and, that, a, copy, of, the, license, is, provided, to, recipients, with, the, code, one, important, legal, precedent, for, open, source, software, was, created, in, 2008, when, the, jacobson, v, katzer, case, enforced, terms, of, the, artistic, license, including, attribution, and, identification, of, modifications, the, ruling, of, this, case, cemented, enforcement, under, copyright, law, when, the, conditions, of, the, license, were, not, followed, because, of, the, similarity, of, the, artistic, license, to, other, open, source, software, licenses, the, ruling, created, a, precedent, that, applied, widely, examples, of, free, software, license, open, source, licenses, include, apache, license, bsd, license, gnu, general, public, license, gnu, lesser, general, public, license, mit, license, eclipse, public, license, and, mozilla, public, license, several, gray, areas, exist, within, software, regulation, that, have, great, impact, on, open, source, software, such, as, if, software, is, a, good, or, service, what, can, be, considered, a, modification, governance, through, contract, vs, license, ownership, and, right, of, use, while, there, have, been, developments, on, these, issues, they, often, lead, to, even, more, questions, the, existence, of, these, uncertainties, in, regulation, has, a, negative, impact, on, industries, involved, in, technologies, as, a, whole, within, the, legal, history, of, software, as, a, whole, there, was, much, debate, on, whether, to, protect, it, as, intellectual, property, under, patent, law, copyright, law, or, establishing, a, unique, regulation, ultimately, copyright, law, became, the, standard, with, computer, programs, being, considered, a, form, of, literary, work, with, some, tweaks, of, unique, regulation, software, is, generally, considered, source, code, and, object, code, with, both, being, protectable, though, there, is, legal, variety, in, this, definition, some, jurisdictions, attempt, to, expand, or, reduce, this, conceptualization, for, their, own, purposes, for, example, the, european, court, of, justice, defines, a, computer, program, as, not, including, the, functionality, of, a, program, the, programing, language, or, the, format, of, data, files, by, limiting, protections, of, the, different, aspects, of, software, the, law, favors, an, open, source, approach, to, software, use, the, us, especially, has, an, open, approach, to, software, with, most, open, source, licenses, originating, there, however, this, has, increased, the, focus, on, patent, rights, within, these, licenses, which, has, seen, backlash, from, the, oss, community, who, prefer, other, forms, of, ip, protection, another, issue, includes, technological, protection, measures, tpm, and, digital, rights, management, drm, techniques, which, were, internationally, legally, recognized, and, protected, in, the, 1996, world, intellectual, property, organization, wipo, treaty, open, source, software, proponents, disliked, these, technologies, as, they, constrained, end, users, potentially, beyond, copyright, law, europe, responded, to, such, complaints, by, putting, tpm, under, legal, controls, representing, a, victory, for, oss, supporters, in, open, source, communities, instead, of, owning, the, software, produced, the, producer, owns, the, development, of, the, evolving, software, in, this, way, the, future, of, the, software, is, open, making, ownership, or, intellectual, property, difficult, within, oss, licensing, and, branding, can, prevent, others, from, stealing, it, preserving, its, status, as, a, public, good, open, source, software, can, be, considered, a, public, good, as, it, is, available, to, everyone, and, does, not, decrease, in, value, for, others, when, downloaded, by, one, person, open, source, software, is, unique, in, that, it, becomes, more, valuable, as, it, is, used, and, contributed, to, instead, of, diminishing, the, resource, this, is, explained, by, concepts, such, as, investment, in, reputation, and, network, effects, the, economic, model, of, open, source, software, can, be, explained, as, developers, contribute, work, to, projects, creating, public, benefits, developers, choose, projects, based, on, the, perceived, benefits, or, costs, such, as, improved, reputation, or, value, of, the, project, the, motivations, of, developers, can, come, from, many, different, places, and, reasons, but, the, important, takeaway, is, that, money, is, not, the, only, or, even, most, important, incentivization, because, economic, theory, mainly, focuses, on, the, consumption, of, scarce, resources, the, oss, dynamic, can, be, hard, to, understand, in, oss, producers, become, consumers, by, reaping, the, rewards, of, contributing, to, a, project, for, example, a, developer, becomes, well, regarded, by, their, peers, for, a, successful, contribution, to, an, oss, project, the, social, benefits, and, interactions, of, oss, are, difficult, to, account, for, in, economic, models, as, well, furthermore, the, innovation, of, technology, creates, constantly, changing, value, discussions, and, outlooks, making, economic, model, unable, to, predict, social, behavior, although, oss, is, theoretically, challenging, in, economic, models, it, is, explainable, as, a, sustainable, social, activity, that, requires, resources, these, resources, include, time, money, technology, and, contributions, many, developers, have, used, technology, funded, by, organizations, such, as, universities, and, governments, though, these, same, organizations, benefit, from, the, work, done, by, oss, as, oss, grows, hybrid, systems, containing, oss, and, proprietary, systems, are, becoming, more, common, throughout, the, mid, 2000s, more, and, more, tech, companies, have, begun, to, use, oss, for, example, dell, s, move, of, selling, computers, with, gnu, linux, already, installed, microsoft, itself, has, launched, a, linux, based, operating, system, despite, previous, animosity, with, the, oss, movement, despite, these, developments, these, companies, tend, to, only, use, oss, for, certain, purposes, leading, to, worries, that, oss, is, being, taken, advantage, of, by, corporations, and, not, given, anything, in, return, while, many, governments, are, interested, in, implementing, and, promoting, open, source, software, due, to, the, many, benefits, provided, a, huge, issue, to, be, considered, is, cybersecurity, while, accidental, vulnerabilities, are, possible, so, are, attacks, by, outside, agents, because, of, these, fears, governmental, interest, in, contributing, to, the, governance, of, software, has, become, more, prominent, however, these, are, the, broad, strokes, of, the, issue, with, each, country, having, their, own, specific, politicized, interactions, with, open, source, software, and, their, goals, for, its, implementation, for, example, the, united, states, has, focused, on, national, security, in, regard, to, open, source, software, implementation, due, to, the, perceived, threat, of, the, increase, of, open, source, software, activity, in, countries, like, china, and, russia, with, the, department, of, defense, considering, multiple, criteria, for, using, oss, these, criteria, include, if, it, comes, from, and, is, maintained, by, trusted, sources, whether, it, will, continue, to, be, maintained, if, there, are, dependencies, on, sub, components, in, the, software, component, security, and, integrity, and, foreign, governmental, influence, another, issue, for, governments, in, regard, to, open, source, is, their, investments, in, technologies, such, as, operating, systems, semiconductors, cloud, and, artificial, intelligence, these, technologies, all, have, implications, for, global, cooperation, again, opening, up, security, issues, and, political, consequences, many, countries, have, to, balance, technological, innovation, with, technological, dependence, in, these, partnerships, for, example, after, china, s, open, source, dependent, company, huawei, was, prevented, from, using, google, s, android, system, in, 2019, they, began, to, create, their, own, alternative, operating, system, harmony, os, germany, recently, established, a, sovereign, tech, fund, to, help, support, the, governance, and, maintenance, of, the, software, that, they, use, in, the, early, days, of, computing, such, as, the, 1950s, and, into, the, 1960s, programmers, and, developers, shared, software, to, learn, from, each, other, and, evolve, the, field, of, computing, for, example, unix, included, the, operating, system, source, code, for, users, eventually, the, commercialization, of, software, in, the, years, 1970, 1980, began, to, prevent, this, practice, however, academics, still, often, developed, software, collaboratively, in, response, the, open, source, movement, was, born, out, of, the, work, of, skilled, programmer, enthusiasts, widely, referred, to, as, hackers, or, hacker, culture, one, of, these, enthusiasts, richard, stallman, was, a, driving, force, behind, the, free, software, movement, which, would, later, allow, for, the, open, source, movement, in, 1984, he, resigned, from, mit, to, create, a, free, operating, system, gnu, after, the, programmer, culture, in, his, lab, was, stifled, by, proprietary, software, preventing, source, code, from, being, shared, and, improved, upon, gnu, was, unix, compatible, meaning, that, the, programmer, enthusiasts, would, still, be, familiar, with, how, it, worked, however, it, quickly, became, apparent, that, there, was, some, confusion, with, the, label, stallman, had, chosen, of, free, software, which, he, described, as, free, as, in, free, speech, not, free, beer, referring, to, the, meaning, of, free, as, freedom, rather, than, price, he, later, expanded, this, concept, of, freedom, to, the, four, essential, freedoms, through, gnu, open, source, norms, of, incorporating, others, source, code, community, bug, fixes, and, suggestions, of, code, for, new, features, appeared, in, 1985, stallman, founded, the, free, software, foundation, fsf, to, promote, changes, in, software, and, to, help, write, gnu, in, order, to, prevent, his, work, from, being, used, in, proprietary, software, stallman, created, the, concept, of, copyleft, which, allowed, the, use, of, his, work, by, anyone, but, under, specific, terms, to, do, this, he, created, the, gnu, general, public, license, gnu, gpl, in, 1989, which, was, updated, in, 1991, in, 1991, gnu, was, combined, with, the, linux, kernel, written, by, linus, torvalds, as, a, kernel, was, missing, in, gnu, the, operating, system, is, now, usually, referred, to, as, linux, throughout, this, whole, period, there, were, many, other, free, software, projects, and, licenses, around, at, the, time, all, with, different, ideas, of, what, the, concept, of, free, software, was, and, should, be, as, well, as, the, morality, of, proprietary, software, such, as, berkeley, software, distribution, tex, and, the, x, window, system, as, free, software, developed, the, free, software, foundation, began, to, look, how, to, bring, free, software, ideas, and, perceived, benefits, to, the, commercial, software, industry, it, was, concluded, that, fsf, s, social, activism, was, not, appealing, to, companies, and, they, needed, a, way, to, rebrand, the, free, software, movement, to, emphasize, the, business, potential, of, sharing, and, collaborating, on, software, source, code, the, term, open, source, was, suggested, by, christine, peterson, in, 1998, at, a, meeting, of, supporters, of, free, software, many, in, the, group, felt, the, name, free, software, was, confusing, to, newcomers, and, holding, back, industry, interest, and, they, readily, accepted, the, new, designation, of, open, source, creating, the, open, source, initiative, osi, and, the, osi, definition, of, what, open, source, software, is, the, open, source, initiative, s, osi, definition, is, now, recognized, by, several, governments, internationally, as, the, standard, or, de, facto, definition, the, definition, was, based, on, the, debian, free, software, guidelines, written, and, adapted, primarily, by, bruce, perens, the, osi, definition, differed, from, the, free, software, definition, in, that, it, allows, the, inclusion, of, proprietary, software, and, allows, more, liberties, in, its, licensing, some, such, as, stallman, agree, more, with, the, original, concept, of, free, software, as, a, result, because, it, takes, a, strong, moral, stance, against, proprietary, software, through, there, is, much, overlap, between, the, two, movements, in, terms, of, the, operation, of, the, software, while, the, open, source, initiative, sought, to, encourage, the, use, of, the, new, term, and, evangelize, the, principles, it, adhered, to, commercial, software, vendors, found, themselves, increasingly, threatened, by, the, concept, of, freely, distributed, software, and, universal, access, to, an, application, s, source, code, with, an, executive, of, microsoft, calling, open, source, an, intellectual, property, destroyer, in, 2001, however, while, free, and, open, source, software, foss, has, historically, played, a, role, outside, of, mainstream, private, software, development, companies, as, large, as, microsoft, have, begun, to, develop, official, open, source, presences, on, the, internet, ibm, oracle, and, state, farm, are, just, a, few, of, the, companies, with, a, serious, public, stake, in, today, s, competitive, open, source, market, marking, a, significant, shift, in, the, corporate, philosophy, concerning, the, development, of, foss, the, future, of, the, open, source, software, community, and, the, free, software, community, by, extension, has, become, successful, if, not, confused, about, what, it, stands, for, for, example, android, and, ubuntu, are, examples, milestones, of, success, in, the, open, source, software, rise, to, prominence, from, the, sidelines, of, technological, innovation, as, it, existed, in, the, early, 2000s, however, some, in, the, community, consider, them, failures, in, their, representation, of, oss, due, to, issues, such, as, the, downplaying, of, the, oss, center, of, android, by, google, and, its, partners, the, use, of, an, apache, license, that, allowed, forking, and, resulted, in, a, loss, of, opportunities, for, collaboration, within, android, the, prioritization, of, convivence, over, freedom, in, ubuntu, and, features, within, ubuntu, that, track, users, for, marketing, purposes, the, use, of, oss, has, become, more, common, in, business, with, 78, of, companies, reporting, that, they, run, all, or, part, of, their, operations, on, foss, the, popularity, of, oss, has, risen, to, the, point, that, microsoft, a, once, detractor, of, oss, has, included, its, use, in, their, systems, however, this, success, has, raised, concerns, that, will, determine, the, future, of, oss, as, the, community, must, answer, questions, such, as, what, oss, is, what, should, it, be, and, what, should, be, done, to, protect, it, if, it, even, needs, protecting, all, in, all, while, the, free, and, open, source, revolution, has, slowed, to, a, perceived, equilibrium, in, the, market, place, that, does, not, mean, it, is, over, as, many, theoretical, discussions, must, take, place, to, determine, its, future, open, source, software, differs, from, proprietary, software, in, that, it, is, publicly, available, the, license, requires, no, fees, modifications, and, distributions, are, allowed, under, license, specifications, all, of, this, works, to, prevent, a, monopoly, on, any, oss, product, which, is, a, goal, of, proprietary, software, proprietary, software, limits, their, customers, choices, to, either, committing, to, using, that, software, upgrading, it, or, switching, to, other, software, forcing, customers, to, have, their, software, preferences, impacted, by, their, monetary, cost, the, ideal, case, scenario, for, the, proprietary, software, vendor, would, be, a, lock, in, where, the, customer, does, not, or, cannot, switch, software, due, to, these, costs, and, continues, to, buy, products, from, that, vendor, within, proprietary, software, bug, fixes, can, only, be, provided, by, the, vendor, moving, platforms, requires, another, purchase, and, the, existence, of, the, product, relies, on, the, vendor, who, can, discontinue, it, at, any, point, additionally, proprietary, software, does, not, provide, its, source, code, and, cannot, be, altered, by, users, for, businesses, this, can, pose, a, security, risk, and, source, of, frustration, as, they, cannot, specialize, the, product, to, their, needs, and, there, may, be, hidden, threats, or, information, leaks, within, the, software, that, they, cannot, access, or, change, under, osi, s, definition, open, source, is, a, broad, software, license, that, makes, source, code, available, to, the, general, public, with, relaxed, or, non, existent, restrictions, on, the, use, and, modification, of, the, code, it, is, an, explicit, feature, of, open, source, that, it, puts, very, few, restrictions, on, the, use, or, distribution, by, any, organization, or, user, in, order, to, enable, the, rapid, evolution, of, the, software, richard, stallman, leader, of, the, free, software, movement, and, member, of, the, free, software, foundation, opposes, the, term, open, source, being, applied, to, what, they, refer, to, as, free, software, although, he, agrees, that, the, two, terms, describe, almost, the, same, category, of, software, stallman, considers, equating, the, terms, incorrect, and, misleading, he, believes, that, the, main, difference, is, that, by, choosing, one, term, over, the, other, lets, others, know, about, what, one, s, goals, are, development, open, source, or, a, social, stance, free, software, nevertheless, there, is, significant, overlap, between, open, source, software, and, free, software, stallman, also, opposes, the, professed, pragmatism, of, the, open, source, initiative, as, he, fears, that, the, free, software, ideals, of, freedom, and, community, are, threatened, by, compromising, on, the, fsf, s, idealistic, standards, for, software, freedom, the, fsf, considers, free, software, to, be, a, subset, of, open, source, software, and, richard, stallman, explained, that, drm, software, for, example, can, be, developed, as, open, source, despite, how, it, restricts, its, users, and, thus, does, not, qualify, as, free, software, the, fsf, said, that, the, term, open, source, fosters, an, ambiguity, of, a, different, kind, such, that, it, confuses, the, mere, availability, of, the, source, with, the, freedom, to, use, modify, and, redistribute, it, on, the, other, hand, the, term, free, software, was, criticized, for, the, ambiguity, of, the, word, free, which, was, seen, as, discouraging, for, business, adoption, and, for, the, historical, ambiguous, usage, of, the, term, developers, have, used, the, alternative, terms, free, and, open, source, software, foss, or, free, libre, and, open, source, software, floss, consequently, to, describe, open, source, software, that, is, also, free, software, software, can, be, distributed, with, source, code, which, is, a, code, that, is, readable, software, is, source, available, when, this, source, code, is, available, to, be, seen, however, to, be, source, available, or, foss, the, source, code, does, not, need, to, be, accessible, to, all, just, the, users, of, that, software, while, all, foss, software, is, source, available, because, this, is, a, requirement, made, by, the, open, source, definition, not, all, source, available, software, is, foss, for, example, if, the, software, doesn, t, meet, other, aspects, of, the, open, source, definition, such, as, permitted, modification, or, redistribution, even, if, the, source, code, is, available, the, software, is, not, foss, a, recent, trend, within, software, companies, is, open, sourcing, or, transitioning, their, previous, proprietary, software, into, open, source, software, through, releasing, it, under, a, open, source, license, examples, of, companies, who, have, done, this, are, google, microsoft, and, apple, additionally, open, sourcing, can, refer, to, programming, open, source, software, or, installing, open, source, software, open, sourcing, can, be, beneficial, in, multiple, ways, such, as, attracting, more, external, contributors, who, bring, new, perspectives, and, problem, solving, capabilities, the, downsides, of, open, sourcing, include, the, work, that, has, to, be, done, to, maintaining, the, new, community, such, as, making, the, base, code, easily, understandable, setting, up, communication, channels, for, new, developers, and, creating, documentation, to, allow, new, developers, to, easily, join, however, a, review, of, several, open, sourced, projects, found, that, although, a, newly, open, sourced, project, attracts, many, newcomers, a, great, amount, are, likely, to, soon, leave, the, project, and, their, forks, are, also, likely, to, not, be, impactful, other, concepts, that, may, share, some, similarities, to, open, source, are, shareware, public, domain, software, freeware, and, software, viewers, readers, that, are, freely, available, but, do, not, provide, source, code, however, these, differ, from, open, source, software, in, access, to, source, code, licensing, copyright, and, fees, despite, being, able, to, collaborate, internationally, open, source, software, contributors, were, found, to, mostly, be, located, in, large, clusters, such, as, silicon, valley, that, largely, collaborate, within, themselves, possible, reasons, for, this, phenomenon, may, be, that, the, oss, contributor, demographic, largely, works, in, software, meaning, that, the, oss, geographic, location, is, closely, related, to, that, dispersion, and, collaborations, could, be, encouraged, through, work, and, social, networks, code, acceptance, can, be, impacted, by, status, within, these, social, network, clusters, creating, unfair, predispositions, in, code, acceptance, based, on, location, barriers, to, international, collaboration, also, include, linguistic, or, cultural, differences, furthermore, each, country, has, been, shown, to, have, a, higher, acceptance, rate, for, code, from, contributors, within, their, country, except, india, indicating, a, bias, for, culturally, similar, collaborators, in, 2021, the, countries, with, the, highest, open, source, software, contributions, included, the, united, states, china, germany, india, and, the, uk, in, that, order, the, counties, with, the, highest, oss, developers, per, capita, from, a, study, in, 2021, include, in, order, iceland, switzerland, norway, sweden, and, finland, while, in, 2008, the, countries, with, top, amount, of, estimated, contributors, in, sourceforge, were, the, united, states, germany, united, kingdom, canada, and, france, though, there, have, been, several, studies, done, on, the, distribution, and, contributions, of, oss, developers, this, is, still, an, open, field, that, can, be, measured, in, several, different, ways, for, instance, information, and, communication, technology, participation, population, wealth, and, proportion, of, access, to, the, internet, have, been, shown, to, be, correlated, with, oss, contributions, although, gender, diversity, has, been, found, to, enhance, team, productivity, women, still, face, biases, while, contributing, to, open, source, software, projects, when, their, gender, is, identifiable, in, 2002, only, 1, 5, of, international, open, source, software, developers, were, women, while, women, made, up, 28, of, tech, industry, roles, demonstrating, their, low, representation, in, the, software, field, despite, oss, contributions, having, no, prerequisites, this, gender, bias, may, continue, to, exist, due, to, the, common, belief, of, contributors, that, gender, shouldn, t, matter, and, the, quality, of, code, should, be, the, only, consideration, for, code, acceptance, preventing, the, community, from, addressing, the, systemic, disparities, in, female, representation, however, a, more, recent, figure, of, female, oss, participation, internationally, calculated, across, 2005, to, 2021, is, 9, 8, with, most, being, recent, contributors, indicating, that, female, participation, may, be, growing, there, are, many, motivations, for, contributing, to, the, oss, community, for, one, it, is, an, opportunity, to, learn, and, practice, multiple, skills, such, as, coding, and, other, technology, related, abilities, but, also, fundamental, skills, such, as, communication, and, collaboration, and, practical, skills, needed, to, excel, in, technology, related, fields, such, as, issue, tracking, or, version, control, instead, of, learning, through, a, classroom, or, a, job, learning, through, contributing, to, oss, allows, participants, to, learn, at, their, own, pace, and, follow, what, interests, them, when, contributing, to, oss, you, can, learn, the, current, industry, best, practices, technology, and, trends, and, even, have, the, opportunity, to, contribute, to, the, next, big, innovation, as, oss, grows, increasingly, popular, within, the, tech, field, contributing, to, oss, without, payment, means, there, is, no, threat, of, being, fired, though, reputations, can, take, a, hit, on, the, other, hand, a, huge, motivation, to, contribute, to, oss, is, the, reputation, gained, as, you, grow, your, public, portfolio, even, though, programming, was, originally, seen, as, a, female, profession, there, remains, a, large, gap, in, computing, social, identity, tends, to, be, a, large, concern, as, women, in, the, tech, industry, face, insecurity, about, attracting, unwanted, male, attention, and, harassment, or, being, unfeminine, in, their, technology, knowledge, having, a, large, impact, on, confidence, some, male, tech, participants, make, clear, that, they, believe, women, fitting, in, within, the, culture, is, impossible, furthering, the, insecurity, for, women, and, their, place, in, the, tech, industry, additionally, even, in, a, voluntary, contribution, environment, like, open, source, software, women, tend, to, end, up, doing, the, less, technical, aspects, of, projects, such, as, manual, testing, or, documentation, despite, women, and, men, showing, the, same, productivity, in, oss, contributions, explicit, biases, include, longer, feedback, time, more, scrutinization, of, code, and, lower, acceptance, rate, of, code, specifically, in, the, open, source, software, community, women, report, that, sexually, offensive, language, is, common, and, the, women, s, identity, as, female, is, given, more, attention, that, as, an, oss, contributor, bias, is, hard, to, address, due, to, the, belief, that, gender, shouldn, t, matter, with, most, contributors, feeling, that, women, getting, special, treatment, is, unfair, and, success, should, be, dependent, on, skill, preventing, any, changes, to, be, more, inclusive, open, source, software, projects, are, built, and, maintained, by, a, network, of, programmers, who, may, often, be, volunteers, and, are, widely, used, in, free, as, well, as, commercial, products, unix, unix, is, an, operating, system, created, by, at, t, that, began, as, a, precursor, to, open, source, software, in, that, the, free, and, open, source, software, revolution, began, when, developers, began, trying, to, create, operating, systems, without, unix, code, unix, was, created, in, the, 1960s, before, the, commercialization, of, software, and, before, the, concept, of, open, source, software, was, necessary, therefore, it, was, not, considered, a, true, open, source, software, project, it, started, as, a, research, project, before, being, commercialized, in, the, mid, 1980s, before, its, commercialization, it, represented, many, of, the, ideals, held, by, the, free, and, open, source, software, revolution, including, the, decentralized, collaboration, of, global, users, rolling, releases, and, a, community, culture, of, distaste, towards, proprietary, software, bsd, berkely, software, distribution, bsd, is, an, operating, system, that, began, as, a, variant, of, unix, in, 1978, that, mixed, unix, code, with, code, from, berkely, labs, to, increase, functionality, as, bsd, was, focused, on, increasing, functionality, it, would, publicly, share, its, greatest, innovations, with, the, main, unix, operating, system, this, is, an, example, of, the, free, public, code, sharing, that, is, a, central, characteristic, of, foss, today, as, unix, became, commercialized, in, the, 1980s, developers, or, members, of, the, community, who, did, not, support, proprietary, software, began, to, focus, on, bsd, and, turning, it, into, an, operating, system, that, did, not, include, any, of, unix, s, code, the, final, version, of, bsd, was, released, in, 1995, gnu, gnu, is, a, free, operating, system, created, by, richard, stallman, in, 1984, with, its, name, meaning, gnu, s, not, unix, the, idea, was, to, create, a, unix, alternative, operating, system, that, would, be, available, for, anyone, to, use, and, allow, programmers, to, share, code, freely, between, them, however, the, goal, of, gnu, was, not, to, only, replace, unix, but, to, make, a, superior, version, that, had, more, technological, capabilities, it, was, released, before, the, philosophical, beliefs, of, the, free, and, open, source, software, revolution, were, truly, defined, because, of, its, creation, by, prominent, foss, programmer, richard, stallman, gnu, was, heavily, involved, in, foss, activism, with, one, of, the, greatest, achievements, of, gnu, being, the, creation, of, the, gnu, general, public, license, or, gpl, which, allowed, developers, to, release, software, that, could, be, legally, shared, and, modified, linux, linux, is, an, operating, system, kernel, that, was, introduced, in, 1991, by, linus, torvalds, linux, was, inspired, by, making, a, better, version, of, the, for, profit, operating, service, minux, it, was, radically, different, than, what, other, hackers, were, producing, at, the, time, due, to, it, being, totally, free, of, cost, and, being, decentralized, later, linux, was, put, under, the, gpl, license, allowing, people, to, make, money, with, linux, and, bringing, linux, into, the, foss, community, apache, apache, began, in, 1995, as, a, collaboration, between, a, group, of, developers, releasing, their, own, web, server, due, to, their, frustration, with, ncsa, httpd, code, base, the, name, apache, was, used, because, of, the, several, patches, they, applied, to, this, code, base, within, a, year, of, its, release, it, became, the, worldwide, leading, web, server, soon, apache, came, out, with, its, own, license, creating, discord, in, the, greater, foss, community, though, ultimately, proving, successful, the, apache, license, allowed, permitted, members, to, directly, access, source, code, a, marked, difference, from, gnu, and, linux, s, approaches, while, the, term, open, source, applied, originally, only, to, the, source, code, of, software, it, is, now, being, applied, to, many, other, areas, such, as, open, source, ecology, a, movement, to, decentralize, technologies, so, that, any, human, can, use, them, however, it, is, often, misapplied, to, other, areas, that, have, different, and, competing, principles, which, overlap, only, partially, the, same, principles, that, underlie, open, source, software, can, be, found, in, many, other, ventures, such, as, open, source, open, content, and, open, collaboration, this, culture, or, ideology, takes, the, view, that, the, principles, apply, more, generally, to, facilitate, concurrent, input, of, different, agendas, approaches, and, priorities, in, contrast, with, more, centralized, models, of, development, such, as, those, typically, used, in, commercial, companies, more, than, 90, percent, of, companies, use, open, source, software, as, a, component, of, their, proprietary, software, the, decision, to, use, open, source, software, or, even, engage, with, open, source, projects, to, improve, existing, open, source, software, is, typically, a, pragmatic, business, decision, when, proprietary, software, is, in, direct, competition, with, an, open, source, alternative, research, has, found, conflicting, results, on, the, effect, of, the, competition, on, the, proprietary, product, s, price, and, quality, for, decades, some, companies, have, made, servicing, of, an, open, source, software, product, for, enterprise, users, their, business, model, these, companies, control, an, open, source, software, product, and, instead, of, charging, for, licensing, or, use, charge, for, improvements, integration, and, other, servicing, software, as, a, service, saas, products, based, on, open, source, components, are, increasingly, common, open, source, software, is, preferred, for, scientific, applications, because, it, increases, transparency, and, aids, in, the, validation, and, acceptance, of, scientific, results
