a, lawn, mower, also, known, as, a, grass, cutter, or, simply, mower, also, often, spelled, lawnmower, is, a, device, utilizing, one, or, more, revolving, blades, or, a, reel, to, cut, a, grass, surface, to, an, even, height, the, height, of, the, cut, grass, may, be, fixed, by, the, design, of, the, mower, but, generally, is, adjustable, by, the, operator, typically, by, a, single, master, lever, or, by, a, mechanism, on, each, of, the, machine, s, wheels, the, blades, may, be, powered, by, manual, force, with, wheels, mechanically, connected, to, the, cutting, blades, so, that, the, blades, spin, when, the, mower, is, pushed, forward, or, the, machine, may, have, a, battery, powered, or, plug, in, electric, motor, the, most, common, self, contained, power, source, for, lawn, mowers, is, a, small, 4, stroke, typically, one, cylinder, internal, combustion, engine, smaller, mowers, often, lack, any, form, of, self, propulsion, requiring, human, power, to, move, over, a, surface, walk, behind, mowers, are, self, propelled, requiring, a, human, only, to, walk, behind, and, guide, them, larger, lawn, mowers, are, usually, either, self, propelled, walk, behind, types, or, more, often, are, ride, on, mowers, that, the, operator, can, sit, on, and, control, a, robotic, lawn, mower, lawn, mowing, bot, mowbot, etc, is, designed, to, operate, either, entirely, on, its, own, or, less, commonly, by, an, operator, on, a, remote, control, two, main, styles, of, blades, are, used, in, lawn, mowers, lawn, mowers, employing, a, single, blade, that, rotates, about, a, single, vertical, axis, are, known, as, rotary, mowers, while, those, employing, a, cutting, bar, and, multiple, blade, assembly, that, rotates, about, a, single, horizontal, axis, are, known, as, cylinder, or, reel, mowers, although, in, some, versions, the, cutting, bar, is, the, only, blade, and, the, rotating, assembly, consists, of, flat, metal, pieces, which, force, the, blades, of, grass, against, the, sharp, cutting, bar, there, are, several, types, of, mowers, each, suited, to, a, particular, scale, and, purpose, the, smallest, types, non, powered, push, mowers, are, suitable, for, small, residential, lawns, and, gardens, electrical, or, piston, engine, powered, push, mowers, are, used, for, larger, residential, lawns, although, there, is, some, overlap, riding, mowers, which, sometimes, resemble, small, tractors, are, larger, than, push, mowers, and, are, suitable, for, large, lawns, although, commercial, riding, lawn, mowers, such, as, zero, turn, mowers, can, be, stand, on, types, and, often, bear, little, resemblance, to, residential, lawn, tractors, being, designed, to, mow, large, areas, at, high, speed, in, the, shortest, time, possible, the, largest, multi, gang, multi, blade, mowers, are, mounted, on, tractors, and, are, designed, for, large, expanses, of, grass, such, as, golf, courses, and, municipal, parks, although, they, are, ill, suited, for, complex, terrain, the, lawn, mower, was, invented, in, 1830, by, edwin, beard, budding, of, stroud, gloucestershire, england, budding, s, mower, was, designed, primarily, to, cut, the, grass, on, sports, grounds, and, extensive, gardens, as, a, superior, alternative, to, the, scythe, and, was, granted, a, british, patent, on, august, 31, 1830, budding, s, first, machine, was, 19, inches, 480, mm, wide, with, a, frame, made, of, wrought, iron, the, mower, was, pushed, from, behind, cast, iron, gear, wheels, transmitted, power, from, the, rear, roller, to, the, cutting, cylinder, allowing, the, rear, roller, to, drive, the, knives, on, the, cutting, cylinder, the, ratio, was, 16, 1, another, roller, placed, between, the, cutting, cylinder, and, the, main, or, land, roller, could, be, raised, or, lowered, to, alter, the, height, of, cut, the, grass, clippings, were, hurled, forward, into, a, tray, like, box, it, was, soon, realized, however, that, an, extra, handle, was, needed, in, front, to, help, pull, the, machine, along, overall, these, machines, were, remarkably, similar, to, modern, mowers, two, of, the, earliest, budding, machines, sold, went, to, regent, s, park, zoological, gardens, in, london, and, the, oxford, colleges, in, an, agreement, between, john, ferrabee, and, edwin, budding, dated, may, 18, 1830, ferrabee, paid, the, costs, of, enlarging, the, small, blades, obtained, letters, of, patent, and, acquired, rights, to, manufacture, sell, and, license, other, manufacturers, in, the, production, of, lawn, mowers, without, patent, budding, and, ferrabee, were, shrewd, enough, to, allow, other, companies, to, build, copies, of, their, mower, under, licence, the, most, successful, of, these, being, ransomes, of, ipswich, which, began, making, mowers, as, early, as, 1832, his, machine, was, the, catalyst, for, the, preparation, of, modern, style, sporting, ovals, playing, fields, pitches, grass, courts, etc, this, led, to, the, codification, of, modern, rules, for, many, sports, including, for, football, lawn, bowls, lawn, tennis, and, others, it, took, ten, more, years, and, further, innovations, to, create, a, machine, that, could, be, drawn, by, animals, and, sixty, years, before, a, steam, powered, lawn, mower, was, built, in, the, 1850s, thomas, green, son, of, leeds, introduced, a, mower, called, the, silens, messor, meaning, silent, cutter, which, used, a, chain, drive, to, transmit, power, from, the, rear, roller, to, the, cutting, cylinder, these, machines, were, lighter, and, quieter, than, the, gear, driven, machines, that, preceded, them, although, they, were, slightly, more, expensive, the, rise, in, popularity, of, lawn, sports, helped, prompt, the, spread, of, the, invention, lawn, mowers, became, a, more, efficient, alternative, to, the, scythe, and, domesticated, grazing, animals, manufacture, of, lawn, mowers, took, off, in, the, 1860s, by, 1862, ferrabee, s, company, was, making, eight, models, in, various, roller, sizes, he, manufactured, over, 5000, machines, until, production, ceased, in, 1863, the, first, grass, boxes, were, flat, trays, but, took, their, present, shape, in, the, 1860s, james, sumner, of, lancashire, patented, the, first, steam, powered, lawn, mower, in, 1893, his, machine, burned, petrol, and, or, paraffin, kerosene, as, fuel, these, were, heavy, machines, that, took, several, hours, to, warm, up, to, operating, pressure, after, numerous, advances, these, machines, were, sold, by, the, stott, fertilizer, and, insecticide, company, of, manchester, and, sumner, the, company, they, both, controlled, was, called, the, leyland, steam, motor, company, around, 1900, one, of, the, best, known, english, machines, was, the, ransomes, automaton, available, in, chain, or, gear, driven, models, numerous, manufacturers, entered, the, field, with, petrol, gasoline, engine, powered, mowers, after, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1902, the, first, was, produced, by, ransomes, jp, engineering, of, leicester, founded, after, world, war, i, produced, a, range, of, very, popular, chain, driven, mowers, about, this, time, an, operator, could, ride, behind, animals, that, pulled, the, large, machines, these, were, the, first, riding, mowers, the, first, united, states, patent, for, a, reel, lawn, mower, was, granted, to, amariah, hills, on, january, 12, 1868, in, 1870, elwood, mcguire, of, richmond, indiana, designed, a, human, pushed, lawn, mower, which, was, very, lightweight, and, a, commercial, success, john, burr, patented, an, improved, rotary, blade, lawn, mower, in, 1899, with, the, wheel, placement, altered, for, better, performance, amariah, hills, went, on, to, found, the, archimedean, lawn, mower, co, in, 1871, in, the, united, states, gasoline, powered, lawn, mowers, were, first, manufactured, in, 1914, by, ideal, power, mower, co, of, lansing, michigan, based, on, a, patent, by, ransom, e, olds, ideal, power, mower, also, introduced, the, world, s, first, self, propelled, riding, lawn, tractor, in, 1922, known, as, the, triplex, the, roller, drive, lawn, mower, has, changed, very, little, since, around, 1930, gang, mowers, those, with, multiple, sets, of, blades, to, cut, a, wider, swath, were, built, in, the, united, states, in, 1919, by, the, worthington, mower, company, in, the, 1920s, one, of, the, most, successful, companies, to, emerge, during, this, period, was, atco, at, that, time, a, brand, name, of, charles, h, pugh, ltd, the, atco, standard, motor, mower, launched, in, 1921, was, an, immediate, success, just, 900, of, the, 22, inch, cut, machines, were, made, in, 1921, each, costing, 75, within, five, years, annual, production, had, accelerated, to, tens, of, thousands, prices, were, reduced, and, a, range, of, sizes, were, available, making, the, standard, the, first, truly, mass, produced, engine, powered, mower, rotary, mowers, were, not, developed, until, engines, were, small, enough, and, powerful, enough, to, run, the, blades, at, sufficient, speed, many, people, experimented, with, rotary, blade, mowers, in, the, late, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, and, power, specialties, ltd, introduced, a, gasoline, powered, rotary, mower, kut, kwick, replaced, the, saw, blade, of, the, pulp, saw, with, a, double, edged, blade, and, a, cutter, deck, converting, the, pulp, saw, into, the, first, ever, out, front, rotary, mower, one, company, that, produced, rotary, mowers, commercially, was, the, australian, victa, company, starting, in, 1952, its, mowers, were, lighter, and, easier, to, use, than, similar, ones, that, had, come, before, the, first, victa, mowers, were, made, at, mortlake, an, inner, suburb, of, sydney, by, local, resident, mervyn, victor, richardson, he, made, his, first, model, out, of, scrap, in, his, garage, the, first, victa, mowers, were, then, manufactured, going, on, sale, on, 20, september, 1952, the, new, company, victa, mowers, pty, ltd, was, incorporated, on, 13, february, 1953, the, venture, was, so, successful, that, by, 1958, the, company, moved, to, much, larger, premises, in, parramatta, road, concord, and, then, to, milperra, by, which, time, the, mower, incorporated, an, engine, designed, and, manufactured, by, victa, which, was, specially, designed, for, mowing, rather, than, employing, a, general, purpose, engine, bought, from, outside, suppliers, two, victa, mowers, from, 1958, and, 1968, respectively, are, held, in, the, collection, of, the, national, museum, of, australia, the, victa, mower, is, regarded, as, something, of, an, australian, icon, appearing, en, masse, in, simulated, form, at, the, opening, of, the, sydney, olympic, games, in, 2000, the, hover, mower, first, introduced, by, flymo, in, 1964, is, a, form, of, rotary, mower, using, an, air, cushion, on, the, hovercraft, principle, a, cylinder, mower, or, reel, mower, carries, a, fixed, horizontal, cutting, blade, at, the, desired, height, of, cut, over, this, is, a, fast, spinning, reel, of, blades, which, force, the, grass, past, the, cutting, bar, each, blade, in, the, blade, cylinder, forms, a, helix, around, the, reel, axis, and, the, set, of, spinning, blades, describes, a, cylinder, of, all, the, mowers, a, properly, adjusted, cylinder, mower, makes, the, cleanest, cut, of, the, grass, and, this, allows, the, grass, to, heal, more, quickly, the, cut, of, a, well, adjusted, cylinder, mower, is, straight, and, definite, as, if, cut, with, a, pair, of, scissors, this, clean, cut, promotes, healthier, thicker, and, more, resilient, lawn, growth, that, is, more, resistant, to, disease, weeds, and, parasites, lawn, cut, with, a, cylinder, mower, is, less, likely, to, result, in, yellow, white, or, brown, discolouration, as, a, result, of, leaf, shredding, while, the, cutting, action, is, often, likened, to, that, of, scissors, it, is, neither, necessary, nor, desirable, for, the, blades, of, the, spinning, cylinder, to, contact, the, horizontal, cutting, bar, when, the, reel, touches, the, cutting, bar, the, work, required, by, the, mower, increases, dramatically, when, the, gap, between, the, blades, is, less, than, the, thickness, of, the, grass, blades, a, clean, cut, can, still, be, made, without, additional, friction, when, the, gap, is, greater, than, the, thickness, of, the, grass, blades, grass, will, slip, through, the, gap, uncut, reel, mowers, also, have, more, difficulty, mowing, over, uneven, terrain, there, are, many, variants, of, the, cylinder, mower, push, mowers, have, no, engine, and, are, usually, used, on, smaller, lawn, areas, where, access, is, a, problem, where, noise, pollution, is, undesirable, and, where, air, pollution, is, unwanted, as, the, mower, is, pushed, along, the, wheels, drive, gears, which, rapidly, spin, the, reel, typical, cutting, widths, are, 10, to, 16, inches, 250, to, 410, mm, advances, in, materials, and, engineering, have, resulted, in, these, mowers, being, very, light, and, easy, to, operate, and, manoeuvre, compared, with, their, predecessors, while, still, giving, all, the, cutting, advantages, of, professional, cylinder, mowers, their, distinct, environmental, benefits, both, in, noise, and, air, pollution, are, also, strong, selling, points, something, not, lost, on, many, international, zoos, animal, sanctuaries, and, exclusive, hotel, groups, the, basic, push, mower, mechanism, is, also, used, in, gangs, towed, behind, a, tractor, the, individual, mowers, are, arranged, in, a, v, behind, the, tractor, with, each, mower, s, track, slightly, overlapping, that, of, the, mower, in, front, of, it, gang, mowers, are, used, over, large, areas, of, turf, such, as, sports, fields, or, parks, a, gasoline, engine, or, electric, motor, can, be, added, to, a, cylinder, mower, to, power, the, cylinder, the, wheels, the, roller, or, any, combination, of, these, a, typical, arrangement, on, electric, powered, machines, for, residential, lawns, is, for, the, motor, to, power, the, cylinder, while, the, operator, pushes, the, mower, along, the, electric, models, can, be, corded, or, cordless, on, petrol, machines, the, engine, drives, both, the, cylinder, and, the, rear, roller, some, variants, have, only, three, blades, in, a, reel, spinning, at, great, speed, and, these, models, are, able, to, cut, grass, which, has, grown, too, long, for, ordinary, push, mowers, one, type, of, reel, mower, now, largely, obsolete, was, a, powered, version, of, the, traditional, side, wheel, push, mower, which, was, used, on, residential, lawns, an, internal, combustion, engine, sat, atop, the, reel, housing, and, drove, the, wheels, usually, through, a, belt, the, wheels, in, turn, drove, the, reel, as, in, the, push, mower, greens, mowers, are, used, for, the, precision, cutting, of, golf, greens, and, have, a, cylinder, made, up, of, at, least, eight, but, normally, ten, blades, the, machine, has, a, roller, before, and, after, the, cutting, cylinder, which, smooths, the, freshly, cut, lawn, and, minimizes, wheel, marks, due, to, the, weight, the, engine, also, propels, the, mower, much, smaller, and, lighter, variants, of, the, roller, mower, are, sometimes, used, for, small, patches, of, ornamental, lawns, around, flower, beds, and, these, have, no, engine, riding, reel, mowers, are, also, produced, typically, the, cutting, reels, are, ahead, of, the, vehicle, s, main, wheels, so, that, the, grass, can, be, cut, before, the, wheels, push, the, grass, over, onto, the, ground, the, reels, are, often, hydraulically, powered, the, main, parts, of, a, cylinder, or, reel, mower, are, a, rotary, mower, rotates, about, a, vertical, axis, with, the, blade, spinning, at, high, speed, relying, on, impact, to, cut, the, grass, this, tends, to, result, in, a, rougher, cut, and, bruises, and, shreds, the, grass, leaf, resulting, in, discolouration, of, the, leaf, ends, as, the, shredded, portion, dies, this, is, particularly, prevalent, if, the, blades, become, clogged, or, blunt, most, rotary, mowers, need, to, be, set, a, little, higher, than, cylinder, equivalents, to, avoid, scalping, and, gouging, of, slightly, uneven, lawns, although, some, modern, rotaries, are, fitted, with, a, rear, roller, to, provide, a, more, formal, striped, cut, these, machines, will, also, tend, to, cut, lower, 13, mm, or, 1, 2, in, than, a, standard, four, wheeled, rotary, the, main, parts, of, a, rotary, mower, are, extensive, grass, trimming, was, not, common, before, the, widespread, application, of, the, vertical, shaft, single, cylinder, gasoline, petrol, engine, in, the, united, states, this, development, paralleled, the, market, penetration, of, companies, such, as, the, briggs, stratton, company, of, wisconsin, most, rotary, push, mowers, are, powered, by, internal, combustion, engines, such, engines, are, usually, four, stroke, engines, used, for, their, greater, torque, and, cleaner, combustion, although, a, number, of, older, models, used, two, stroke, engines, running, on, gasoline, petrol, or, other, liquid, fuels, internal, combustion, engines, used, with, lawn, mowers, normally, have, only, one, cylinder, power, generally, ranges, from, four, to, seven, horsepower, the, engines, usually, have, a, carburetor, and, require, a, manual, pull, crank, to, start, them, although, an, electric, starter, is, offered, on, some, models, particularly, large, riding, and, commercial, mowers, some, mowers, have, a, throttle, control, on, the, handlebar, with, which, the, operator, can, adjust, the, engine, speed, other, mowers, have, a, fixed, pre, set, engine, speed, all, are, equipped, with, a, governor, often, centrifugal, mechanical, or, air, vane, style, to, open, the, throttle, as, needed, to, maintain, the, pre, selected, speed, when, the, force, needed, to, cut, the, thicker, or, taller, grass, is, encountered, gasoline, mowers, have, the, advantages, over, electric, mowers, of, greater, power, and, distance, range, they, do, create, a, significant, amount, of, pollution, due, to, the, combustion, in, the, engine, and, their, engines, require, periodic, maintenance, such, as, cleaning, or, replacement, of, the, spark, plug, and, air, filter, and, changing, the, engine, oil, california, passed, assembly, bill, 1356, an, air, pollution, control, law, on, october, 9, 2021, the, california, bill, barred, sales, of, spark, ignited, gasoline, fueled, internal, combustion, engines, less, than, 25hp, used, for, farm, or, construction, machines, as, of, january, 1, 2024, the, california, bill, does, not, ban, turf, care, machines, larger, than, 25hp, or, those, powered, by, compression, ignition, diesel, engines, electric, mowers, are, further, subdivided, into, corded, and, cordless, electric, models, both, are, relatively, quiet, typically, producing, less, than, 75, decibels, while, a, gasoline, lawn, mower, can, be, 95, decibels, or, more, corded, electric, mowers, are, limited, in, range, by, their, trailing, power, cord, which, may, limit, their, use, with, lawns, extending, outward, more, than, 100, 150, feet, 30, 45, m, from, the, nearest, available, power, outlet, there, is, the, additional, hazard, with, these, machines, of, accidentally, mowing, over, the, power, cable, which, stops, the, mower, and, may, put, users, at, risk, of, receiving, a, dangerous, electric, shock, installing, a, residual, current, device, gfci, on, the, outlet, may, reduce, the, shock, risk, cordless, electric, mowers, are, powered, by, a, variable, number, typically, 1, 4, of, 12, to, 80, volt, rechargeable, batteries, typically, more, batteries, mean, more, run, time, and, or, power, and, more, weight, batteries, can, be, in, the, interior, of, the, lawnmower, or, on, the, outside, if, on, the, outside, the, depleted, batteries, can, be, quickly, swapped, with, recharged, batteries, cordless, mowers, have, the, maneuverability, of, a, gasoline, powered, mower, and, the, environmental, friendliness, of, a, corded, electric, mower, but, they, are, more, expensive, and, come, in, fewer, models, particularly, the, self, propelling, type, than, either, the, eventual, disposal, of, worn, out, batteries, is, problematic, though, some, manufacturers, offer, to, recycle, them, and, the, motors, in, some, cordless, mowers, tend, to, be, less, powerful, than, gasoline, motors, of, the, same, total, weight, including, batteries, lawn, mowers, powered, by, propane, were, also, manufactured, by, lehr, in, hand, powered, lawn, mowers, the, reel, is, attached, to, the, mower, s, wheels, by, gears, so, that, when, the, mower, is, pushed, forward, the, reel, spins, several, times, faster, than, the, plastic, or, rubber, tired, wheels, turn, depending, on, the, placement, of, the, reel, these, mowers, often, cannot, cut, grass, very, close, to, lawn, obstacles, hover, mowers, are, powered, rotary, push, lawn, mowers, that, use, an, impeller, above, the, spinning, blades, to, drive, air, downward, thereby, creating, an, air, cushion, that, lifts, the, mower, above, the, ground, the, operator, can, then, easily, move, the, mower, as, it, floats, over, the, grass, hover, mowers, are, necessarily, light, in, order, to, achieve, the, air, cushion, and, typically, have, plastic, bodies, with, an, electric, motor, the, most, significant, disadvantage, however, is, the, cumbersome, usability, in, rough, terrain, or, on, the, edges, of, lawns, as, the, lifting, air, cushion, is, destroyed, by, wide, gaps, between, the, chassis, and, the, ground, hover, mowers, are, built, to, operate, on, steep, slopes, waterfronts, and, high, weeded, areas, so, they, are, often, used, by, golf, course, greenskeepers, and, commercial, landscapers, grass, collection, is, often, available, but, can, be, poor, in, some, models, the, quality, of, cut, can, be, inferior, if, the, grass, is, pushed, away, from, the, blade, by, the, cushion, of, air, a, robotic, lawn, mower, is, an, autonomous, robot, used, to, cut, lawn, grass, a, typical, robotic, lawn, mower, in, particular, earlier, generation, models, requires, the, user, to, set, up, a, border, wire, around, the, lawn, that, defines, the, area, to, be, mowed, the, robot, uses, this, wire, to, locate, the, boundary, of, the, area, to, be, trimmed, and, in, some, cases, to, locate, a, recharging, dock, robotic, mowers, are, capable, of, maintaining, up, to, 30, 000, m, 2, 320, 000, sq, ft, of, grass, robotic, lawn, mowers, are, increasingly, sophisticated, are, self, docking, and, some, contain, rain, sensors, if, necessary, nearly, eliminating, human, interaction, robotic, lawn, mowers, represented, the, second, largest, category, of, domestic, robots, used, by, the, end, of, 2005, in, 2012, the, growth, of, robotic, lawn, mower, sales, was, 15, times, that, of, the, traditional, styles, tractor, pulled, mowers, are, usually, in, the, form, of, an, attachment, to, a, tractor, the, attachments, can, simply, function, by, the, movement, of, the, tractor, similar, to, manual, push, cylinder, mowers, but, also, sometimes, may, have, powered, moving, blades, they, are, commonly, mounted, on, either, the, side, or, the, back, of, the, tractor, riding, mowers, u, s, and, canada, or, ride, on, mowers, u, k, and, canada, are, a, popular, alternative, for, large, lawns, the, operator, is, provided, with, a, seat, and, controls, on, the, mower, and, literally, rides, on, the, machine, most, use, the, horizontal, rotating, blade, system, though, usually, with, multiple, blades, a, common, form, of, ride, on, mower, is, the, lawn, tractor, these, are, usually, designed, to, resemble, a, small, agricultural, tractor, with, the, cutting, deck, mounted, amidships, between, the, front, and, rear, axles, the, drives, for, these, mowers, are, in, several, categories, the, most, common, transmission, for, tractors, is, a, manual, transmission, the, second, most, common, transmission, type, is, a, form, of, continuously, variable, transmission, called, the, hydrostatic, transmission, these, transmissions, take, several, forms, from, pumps, driving, separate, motors, which, may, incorporate, a, gear, reduction, to, fully, integrated, units, containing, a, pump, motor, and, gear, reduction, hydrostatic, transmissions, are, more, expensive, than, mechanical, transmissions, but, they, are, easier, to, use, and, can, transmit, greater, torque, to, the, wheels, compared, to, a, typical, mechanical, transmission, the, least, common, drive, type, and, the, most, expensive, is, electric, there, have, been, a, number, of, attempts, to, replace, hydrostatic, transmissions, with, lower, cost, alternatives, but, these, attempts, which, include, variable, belt, types, e, g, mtd, s, auto, drive, and, toroidal, have, various, performance, or, perception, problems, that, have, caused, their, market, life, to, be, short, or, their, market, penetration, to, be, limited, riding, lawn, mowers, can, often, mount, other, devices, such, as, rototillers, rotavators, snow, plows, snow, blowers, yard, vacuums, occasionally, even, front, buckets, or, fork, lift, tines, these, are, more, properly, known, as, lawn, tractors, in, this, case, being, designed, for, a, number, of, tasks, the, ability, to, tow, other, devices, is, because, they, have, multiple, gears, often, up, to, 5, or, 6, and, variable, top, speeds, compact, utility, tractors, equipped, with, a, belly, mower, can, look, similar, to, riding, lawn, mowers, but, they, are, typically, larger, equipped, with, diesel, engines, and, feature, a, three, point, hitch, and, rollover, protection, structure, these, features, are, generally, absent, on, riding, lawn, mowers, the, deck, of, a, rotary, mower, is, typically, made, of, steel, lighter, steel, is, used, on, less, expensive, models, and, heavier, steel, on, more, expensive, models, for, durability, other, deck, materials, include, aluminium, which, does, not, rust, and, is, a, staple, of, higher, priced, mowers, and, hard, composite, plastic, which, does, not, rust, and, is, lighter, and, less, expensive, than, aluminium, electric, mowers, typically, have, a, plastic, deck, riding, mowers, typically, have, an, opening, in, the, side, or, rear, of, the, housing, where, the, cut, grass, is, expelled, as, do, most, rotary, lawn, mowers, some, have, a, grass, catcher, attachment, at, the, opening, to, bag, the, grass, clippings, mulching, mowers, use, special, mulching, blades, which, are, available, for, rotary, mowers, the, blade, is, designed, to, keep, the, clippings, circulating, underneath, the, mower, until, the, clippings, are, chopped, quite, small, other, designs, have, twin, blades, to, mulch, the, clippings, to, small, pieces, this, function, has, the, advantages, of, forgoing, the, additional, work, collecting, and, disposing, of, grass, clippings, while, reducing, lawn, waste, in, such, a, way, that, also, creates, convenient, compost, for, the, lawn, forgoing, the, expense, and, adverse, environmental, effect, of, fertilizer, mower, manufacturers, market, their, mowers, as, side, discharge, 2, in, 1, meaning, bagging, and, mulching, or, side, discharging, and, mulching, and, 3, in, 1, meaning, bagging, mulching, and, side, discharge, most, 2, in, 1, bagging, and, mulching, mowers, require, a, separate, attachment, to, discharge, grass, onto, the, lawn, some, side, discharge, mower, manufacturers, also, sell, separate, mulching, plates, that, will, cover, the, opening, on, the, side, discharge, mower, and, in, combination, with, the, proper, blades, will, convert, the, mower, to, a, mulching, mower, these, conversions, are, impractical, when, compared, with, 2, or, 3, in, 1, mowers, which, can, be, converted, in, the, field, in, seconds, there, are, two, types, of, bagging, mowers, a, rear, bag, mower, features, an, opening, on, the, back, of, the, mower, through, which, the, grass, is, expelled, into, the, bag, hi, vac, mowers, have, a, tunnel, that, extends, from, the, side, discharge, to, the, bag, hi, vac, is, also, the, type, of, grass, collection, used, on, some, riding, lawn, mowers, and, lawn, tractors, and, is, suitable, for, use, in, dry, conditions, but, less, suitable, for, long, wet, lush, grass, as, they, often, clog, up, mulching, and, bagging, mowers, are, not, well, suited, to, long, grass, or, thick, weeds, in, some, ride, on, mowers, the, cut, grass, is, dropped, onto, the, ground, and, then, collected, by, a, set, of, rotating, bristles, allowing, even, long, wet, grass, to, be, collected, rotary, mowers, with, internal, combustion, engines, come, in, three, price, ranges, low, priced, mowers, use, older, technology, smaller, motors, and, lighter, steel, decks, these, mowers, are, targeted, at, the, residential, market, and, typically, price, is, the, most, important, selling, point, professional, grass, cutting, equipment, used, by, large, establishments, such, as, universities, sports, stadiums, and, local, authorities, usually, take, the, form, of, much, larger, dedicated, ride, on, platforms, or, attachments, that, can, be, mounted, on, or, behind, a, standard, tractor, unit, a, gang, mower, either, type, may, use, rotating, blade, or, cylindrical, blade, type, cutters, although, high, quality, mowed, surfaces, demand, the, latter, wide, area, mowers, wams, are, commercial, grade, mowers, which, have, decks, extended, to, either, side, many, to, 12, feet, 3, 7, m, these, extensions, can, be, lowered, for, large, area, mowing, or, raised, to, decrease, the, mower, s, width, and, allow, for, easy, transport, on, city, roads, or, trailers, commercial, lawn, mowing, companies, have, also, enthusiastically, adopted, types, such, as, the, zero, turn, mower, in, both, ride, on, and, stand, on, versions, which, allow, high, speed, over, the, grass, surface, and, rapid, turnaround, at, the, end, of, rows, as, well, as, excellent, maneuverability, around, obstacles, mowers, mounted, on, a, tractor, s, three, point, hitch, may, be, known, as, finish, mowers, used, for, maintaining, lawn, flail, mowers, used, for, maintaining, rough, grass, on, rough, surfaces, or, brush, mowers, used, for, cutting, brush, and, small, trees, rotary, mowers, can, throw, out, debris, with, extreme, velocity, and, energy, additionally, the, blades, of, a, self, powered, push, mower, gasoline, or, electric, can, injure, a, careless, or, inattentive, user, consequently, many, come, equipped, with, a, dead, man, s, switch, to, immediately, disable, the, blade, rotation, when, the, user, is, no, longer, holding, the, handle, in, the, united, states, over, 12, 000, people, per, year, are, hospitalized, as, a, result, of, lawn, mower, accidents, in, 2016, 86, 000, adults, and, 4, 500, children, were, admitted, to, the, emergency, room, for, lawnmower, injuries, the, vast, majority, of, these, injuries, can, be, prevented, by, wearing, protective, footwear, when, mowing, the, american, academy, of, pediatrics, recommends, that, children, be, at, least, 12, years, old, before, they, are, allowed, to, use, a, walk, behind, lawn, mower, and, at, least, 16, years, of, age, before, using, a, riding, mower, and, that, they, should, not, operate, lawn, mowers, until, they, have, displayed, the, necessary, levels, of, judgment, strength, coordination, and, maturity, persons, using, a, mower, should, wear, heavy, footwear, eye, protection, and, hearing, protection, in, the, case, of, engine, powered, mowers, a, 2001, study, showed, that, some, mowers, produce, the, same, amount, of, pollution, emissions, other, than, carbon, dioxide, in, one, hour, as, driving, a, 1992, model, vehicle, for, 650, miles, 1, 050, km, another, estimate, puts, the, amount, of, pollution, from, a, lawn, mower, at, four, times, the, amount, from, a, car, per, hour, although, this, report, is, no, longer, available, beginning, in, 2011, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, set, standards, for, lawn, equipment, emissions, and, expects, a, reduction, of, at, least, 35, percent, gas, powered, lawn, mowers, produce, ghg, emissions, a, minimum, maintained, lawn, management, practice, with, clipping, recycling, and, minimum, irrigation, and, mowing, is, recommended, to, mitigate, global, warming, effects, from, urban, turfgrass, system, battery, powered, lawn, mowers, offer, cleaner, alternatives, to, consumers, by, producing, zero, emissions, being, more, efficient, and, eliminating, risks, of, spilled, gasoline, gasoline, powered, lawnmowers, are, not, regulated, to, have, emission, capturing, technology, mowers, can, create, significant, noise, pollution, and, could, cause, hearing, loss, if, used, without, hearing, protection, for, prolonged, periods, of, time, lawn, mowers, also, present, an, occupational, hearing, hazard, to, the, nearly, one, million, people, who, work, in, lawn, service, and, ground, keeping, one, study, assessed, the, occupational, noise, exposure, among, groundskeepers, at, several, north, carolina, public, universities, and, found, noise, levels, from, push, lawn, mowers, measured, between, 86, and, 95, decibels, a, weighted, and, from, riding, lawn, mowers, between, 88, and, 96, db, a, both, types, exceeded, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, recommended, exposure, limit, of, 85, db, a, the, risk, of, hearing, loss, and, noise, pollution, can, be, reduced, by, using, battery, operated, mowers, or, appropriate, hearing, protection, such, as, earplugs, or, earmuffs, it, is, possible, for, a, lawn, mower, to, damage, the, underlying, soil, the, roots, of, the, grass, and, the, mower, itself, if, the, blades, cut, through, the, grass, and, collide, with, the, underlying, ground, therefore, it, is, important, to, adjust, mower, height, properly, and, choose, the, right, tires, for, a, lawn, mower, to, prevent, any, marking, or, digging
