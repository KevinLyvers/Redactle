a, diode, is, a, two, terminal, electronic, component, that, conducts, current, primarily, in, one, direction, asymmetric, conductance, it, has, low, ideally, zero, resistance, in, one, direction, and, high, ideally, infinite, resistance, in, the, other, a, semiconductor, diode, the, most, commonly, used, type, today, is, a, crystalline, piece, of, semiconductor, material, with, a, p, n, junction, connected, to, two, electrical, terminals, it, has, an, exponential, current, voltage, characteristic, semiconductor, diodes, were, the, first, semiconductor, electronic, devices, the, discovery, of, asymmetric, electrical, conduction, across, the, contact, between, a, crystalline, mineral, and, a, metal, was, made, by, german, physicist, ferdinand, braun, in, 1874, today, most, diodes, are, made, of, silicon, but, other, semiconducting, materials, such, as, gallium, arsenide, and, germanium, are, also, used, the, obsolete, thermionic, diode, is, a, vacuum, tube, with, two, electrodes, a, heated, cathode, and, a, plate, in, which, electrons, can, flow, in, only, one, direction, from, the, cathode, the, to, plate, among, many, uses, diodes, are, found, in, rectifiers, to, convert, alternating, current, ac, power, to, direct, current, dc, demodulation, in, radio, receivers, and, can, even, be, used, for, logic, or, as, temperature, sensors, a, common, variant, of, a, diode, is, a, light, emitting, diode, which, is, used, as, electric, lighting, and, status, indicators, on, electronic, devices, the, most, common, function, of, a, diode, is, to, allow, an, electric, current, to, pass, in, one, direction, called, the, diode, s, forward, direction, while, blocking, it, in, the, opposite, direction, the, reverse, direction, its, hydraulic, analogy, is, a, check, valve, this, unidirectional, behavior, can, convert, alternating, current, ac, to, direct, current, dc, a, process, called, rectification, as, rectifiers, diodes, can, be, used, for, such, tasks, as, extracting, modulation, from, radio, signals, in, radio, receivers, a, diode, s, behavior, is, often, simplified, as, having, a, forward, threshold, voltage, or, turn, on, voltage, or, cut, in, voltage, above, which, there, is, significant, current, and, below, which, there, is, almost, no, current, which, depends, on, a, diode, s, composition, this, voltage, may, loosely, be, referred, to, simply, as, the, diode, s, forward, voltage, drop, or, just, voltage, drop, since, a, consequence, of, the, steepness, of, the, exponential, is, that, a, diode, s, voltage, drop, will, not, significantly, exceed, the, threshold, voltage, under, normal, forward, bias, operating, conditions, datasheets, typically, quote, a, typical, or, maximum, forward, voltage, v, f, for, a, specified, current, and, temperature, e, g, 20, ma, and, 25, c, for, leds, so, the, user, has, a, guarantee, about, when, a, certain, amount, of, current, will, kick, in, at, higher, currents, the, forward, voltage, drop, of, the, diode, increases, for, instance, a, drop, of, 1, v, to, 1, 5, v, is, typical, at, full, rated, current, for, silicon, power, diodes, see, also, rectifier, rectifier, voltage, drop, however, a, semiconductor, diode, s, exponential, current, voltage, characteristic, is, really, more, gradual, than, this, simple, on, off, action, although, an, exponential, function, may, appear, to, have, a, definite, knee, around, this, threshold, when, viewed, on, a, linear, scale, the, knee, is, an, illusion, that, depends, on, the, scale, of, y, axis, representing, current, in, a, semi, log, plot, using, a, logarithmic, scale, for, current, and, a, linear, scale, for, voltage, the, diode, s, exponential, curve, instead, appears, more, like, a, straight, line, since, a, diode, s, forward, voltage, drop, varies, only, a, little, with, the, current, and, is, more, so, a, function, of, temperature, this, effect, can, be, used, as, a, temperature, sensor, or, as, a, somewhat, imprecise, voltage, reference, a, diode, s, high, resistance, to, current, flowing, in, the, reverse, direction, suddenly, drops, to, a, low, resistance, when, the, reverse, voltage, across, the, diode, reaches, a, value, called, the, breakdown, voltage, this, effect, is, used, to, regulate, voltage, zener, diodes, or, to, protect, circuits, from, high, voltage, surges, avalanche, diodes, a, semiconductor, diode, s, current, voltage, characteristic, can, be, tailored, by, selecting, the, semiconductor, materials, and, the, doping, impurities, introduced, into, the, materials, during, manufacture, these, techniques, are, used, to, create, special, purpose, diodes, that, perform, many, different, functions, for, example, to, electronically, tune, radio, and, tv, receivers, varactor, diodes, to, generate, radio, frequency, oscillations, tunnel, diodes, gunn, diodes, impatt, diodes, and, to, produce, light, light, emitting, diodes, tunnel, gunn, and, impatt, diodes, exhibit, negative, resistance, which, is, useful, in, microwave, and, switching, circuits, diodes, both, vacuum, and, semiconductor, can, be, used, as, shot, noise, generators, thermionic, vacuum, tube, diodes, and, solid, state, semiconductor, diodes, were, developed, separately, at, approximately, the, same, time, in, the, early, 1900s, as, radio, receiver, detectors, until, the, 1950s, vacuum, diodes, were, used, more, frequently, in, radios, because, the, early, point, contact, semiconductor, diodes, were, less, stable, in, addition, most, receiving, sets, had, vacuum, tubes, for, amplification, that, could, easily, have, the, thermionic, diodes, included, in, the, tube, for, example, the, 12sq7, double, diode, triode, and, vacuum, tube, rectifiers, and, gas, filled, rectifiers, were, capable, of, handling, some, high, voltage, high, current, rectification, tasks, better, than, the, semiconductor, diodes, such, as, selenium, rectifiers, that, were, available, at, that, time, in, 1873, frederick, guthrie, observed, that, a, grounded, white, hot, metal, ball, brought, in, close, proximity, to, an, electroscope, would, discharge, a, positively, charged, electroscope, but, not, a, negatively, charged, electroscope, in, 1880, thomas, edison, observed, unidirectional, current, between, heated, and, unheated, elements, in, a, bulb, later, called, edison, effect, and, was, granted, a, patent, on, application, of, the, phenomenon, for, use, in, a, dc, voltmeter, about, 20, years, later, john, ambrose, fleming, scientific, adviser, to, the, marconi, company, and, former, edison, employee, realized, that, the, edison, effect, could, be, used, as, a, radio, detector, fleming, patented, the, first, true, thermionic, diode, the, fleming, valve, in, britain, on, 16, november, 1904, followed, by, u, s, patent, 803, 684, in, november, 1905, throughout, the, vacuum, tube, era, valve, diodes, were, used, in, almost, all, electronics, such, as, radios, televisions, sound, systems, and, instrumentation, they, slowly, lost, market, share, beginning, in, the, late, 1940s, due, to, selenium, rectifier, technology, and, then, to, semiconductor, diodes, during, the, 1960s, today, they, are, still, used, in, a, few, high, power, applications, where, their, ability, to, withstand, transient, voltages, and, their, robustness, gives, them, an, advantage, over, semiconductor, devices, and, in, musical, instrument, and, audiophile, applications, in, 1874, german, scientist, karl, ferdinand, braun, discovered, the, unilateral, conduction, across, a, contact, between, a, metal, and, a, mineral, indian, scientist, jagadish, chandra, bose, was, the, first, to, use, a, crystal, for, detecting, radio, waves, in, 1894, the, crystal, detector, was, developed, into, a, practical, device, for, wireless, telegraphy, by, greenleaf, whittier, pickard, who, invented, a, silicon, crystal, detector, in, 1903, and, received, a, patent, for, it, on, 20, november, 1906, other, experimenters, tried, a, variety, of, other, minerals, as, detectors, semiconductor, principles, were, unknown, to, the, developers, of, these, early, rectifiers, during, the, 1930s, understanding, of, physics, advanced, and, in, the, mid, 1930s, researchers, at, bell, telephone, laboratories, recognized, the, potential, of, the, crystal, detector, for, application, in, microwave, technology, researchers, at, bell, labs, western, electric, mit, purdue, and, in, the, uk, intensively, developed, point, contact, diodes, crystal, rectifiers, or, crystal, diodes, during, world, war, ii, for, application, in, radar, after, world, war, ii, at, t, used, these, in, its, microwave, towers, that, criss, crossed, the, united, states, and, many, radar, sets, use, them, even, in, the, 21st, century, in, 1946, sylvania, began, offering, the, 1n34, crystal, diode, during, the, early, 1950s, junction, diodes, were, developed, in, 2022, the, first, superconducting, diode, effect, without, an, external, magnetic, field, was, realized, at, the, time, of, their, invention, asymmetrical, conduction, devices, were, known, as, rectifiers, in, 1919, the, year, tetrodes, were, invented, william, henry, eccles, coined, the, term, diode, from, the, greek, roots, di, from, meaning, two, and, ode, from, meaning, path, the, word, diode, however, was, already, in, use, as, were, triode, tetrode, pentode, hexode, as, terms, of, multiplex, telegraphy, although, all, diodes, rectify, rectifier, usually, applies, to, diodes, used, for, power, supply, to, differentiate, them, from, diodes, intended, for, small, signal, circuits, a, thermionic, diode, is, a, thermionic, valve, device, consisting, of, a, sealed, evacuated, glass, or, metal, envelope, containing, two, electrodes, a, cathode, and, a, plate, the, cathode, is, either, indirectly, heated, or, directly, heated, if, indirect, heating, is, employed, a, heater, is, included, in, the, envelope, in, operation, the, cathode, is, heated, to, red, heat, around, 800, 1, 000, c, 1, 470, 1, 830, f, a, directly, heated, cathode, is, made, of, tungsten, wire, and, is, heated, by, a, current, passed, through, it, from, an, external, voltage, source, an, indirectly, heated, cathode, is, heated, by, infrared, radiation, from, a, nearby, heater, that, is, formed, of, nichrome, wire, and, supplied, with, current, provided, by, an, external, voltage, source, the, operating, temperature, of, the, cathode, causes, it, to, release, electrons, into, the, vacuum, a, process, called, thermionic, emission, the, cathode, is, coated, with, oxides, of, alkaline, earth, metals, such, as, barium, and, strontium, oxides, these, have, a, low, work, function, meaning, that, they, more, readily, emit, electrons, than, would, the, uncoated, cathode, the, plate, not, being, heated, does, not, emit, electrons, but, is, able, to, absorb, them, the, alternating, voltage, to, be, rectified, is, applied, between, the, cathode, and, the, plate, when, the, plate, voltage, is, positive, with, respect, to, the, cathode, the, plate, electrostatically, attracts, the, electrons, from, the, cathode, so, a, current, of, electrons, flows, through, the, tube, from, cathode, to, plate, when, the, plate, voltage, is, negative, with, respect, to, the, cathode, no, electrons, are, emitted, by, the, plate, so, no, current, can, pass, from, the, plate, to, the, cathode, point, contact, diodes, were, developed, starting, in, the, 1930s, out, of, the, early, crystal, detector, technology, and, are, now, generally, used, in, the, 3, to, 30, gigahertz, range, point, contact, diodes, use, a, small, diameter, metal, wire, in, contact, with, a, semiconductor, crystal, and, are, of, either, non, welded, contact, type, or, welded, contact, type, non, welded, contact, construction, utilizes, the, schottky, barrier, principle, the, metal, side, is, the, pointed, end, of, a, small, diameter, wire, that, is, in, contact, with, the, semiconductor, crystal, in, the, welded, contact, type, a, small, p, region, is, formed, in, the, otherwise, n, type, crystal, around, the, metal, point, during, manufacture, by, momentarily, passing, a, relatively, large, current, through, the, device, point, contact, diodes, generally, exhibit, lower, capacitance, higher, forward, resistance, and, greater, reverse, leakage, than, junction, diodes, a, p, n, junction, diode, is, made, of, a, crystal, of, semiconductor, usually, silicon, but, germanium, and, gallium, arsenide, are, also, used, impurities, are, added, to, it, to, create, a, region, on, one, side, that, contains, negative, charge, carriers, electrons, called, an, n, type, semiconductor, and, a, region, on, the, other, side, that, contains, positive, charge, carriers, holes, called, a, p, type, semiconductor, when, the, n, type, and, p, type, materials, are, attached, together, a, momentary, flow, of, electrons, occurs, from, the, n, to, the, p, side, resulting, in, a, third, region, between, the, two, where, no, charge, carriers, are, present, this, region, is, called, the, depletion, region, because, there, are, no, charge, carriers, neither, electrons, nor, holes, in, it, the, diode, s, terminals, are, attached, to, the, n, type, and, p, type, regions, the, boundary, between, these, two, regions, called, a, p, n, junction, is, where, the, action, of, the, diode, takes, place, when, a, sufficiently, higher, electrical, potential, is, applied, to, the, p, side, the, anode, than, to, the, n, side, the, cathode, it, allows, electrons, to, flow, through, the, depletion, region, from, the, n, type, side, to, the, p, type, side, the, junction, does, not, allow, the, flow, of, electrons, in, the, opposite, direction, when, the, potential, is, applied, in, reverse, creating, in, a, sense, an, electrical, check, valve, another, type, of, junction, diode, the, schottky, diode, is, formed, from, a, metal, semiconductor, junction, rather, than, a, p, n, junction, which, reduces, capacitance, and, increases, switching, speed, a, semiconductor, diode, s, behavior, in, a, circuit, is, given, by, its, current, voltage, characteristic, the, shape, of, the, curve, is, determined, by, the, transport, of, charge, carriers, through, the, so, called, depletion, layer, or, depletion, region, that, exists, at, the, p, n, junction, between, differing, semiconductors, when, a, p, n, junction, is, first, created, conduction, band, mobile, electrons, from, the, n, doped, region, diffuse, into, the, p, doped, region, where, there, is, a, large, population, of, holes, vacant, places, for, electrons, with, which, the, electrons, recombine, when, a, mobile, electron, recombines, with, a, hole, both, hole, and, electron, vanish, leaving, behind, an, immobile, positively, charged, donor, dopant, on, the, n, side, and, negatively, charged, acceptor, dopant, on, the, p, side, the, region, around, the, p, n, junction, becomes, depleted, of, charge, carriers, and, thus, behaves, as, an, insulator, however, the, width, of, the, depletion, region, called, the, depletion, width, cannot, grow, without, limit, for, each, electron, hole, pair, recombination, made, a, positively, charged, dopant, ion, is, left, behind, in, the, n, doped, region, and, a, negatively, charged, dopant, ion, is, created, in, the, p, doped, region, as, recombination, proceeds, and, more, ions, are, created, an, increasing, electric, field, develops, through, the, depletion, zone, that, acts, to, slow, and, then, finally, stop, recombination, at, this, point, there, is, a, built, in, potential, across, the, depletion, zone, if, an, external, voltage, is, placed, across, the, diode, with, the, same, polarity, as, the, built, in, potential, the, depletion, zone, continues, to, act, as, an, insulator, preventing, any, significant, electric, current, flow, unless, electron, hole, pairs, are, actively, being, created, in, the, junction, by, for, instance, light, see, photodiode, however, if, the, polarity, of, the, external, voltage, opposes, the, built, in, potential, recombination, can, once, again, proceed, resulting, in, a, substantial, electric, current, through, the, p, n, junction, i, e, substantial, numbers, of, electrons, and, holes, recombine, at, the, junction, that, increases, exponentially, with, voltage, a, diode, s, current, voltage, characteristic, can, be, approximated, by, four, operating, regions, from, lower, to, higher, bias, voltages, these, are, the, shockley, ideal, diode, equation, or, the, diode, law, named, after, the, bipolar, junction, transistor, co, inventor, william, bradford, shockley, models, the, exponential, current, voltage, i, v, relationship, of, diodes, in, moderate, forward, or, reverse, bias, the, article, shockley, diode, equation, provides, details, at, forward, voltages, less, than, the, saturation, voltage, the, voltage, versus, current, characteristic, curve, of, most, diodes, is, not, a, straight, line, the, current, can, be, approximated, by, i, i, s, e, v, d, n, v, t, displaystyle, i, i, text, s, e, v, text, d, nv, text, t, as, explained, in, the, shockley, diode, equation, article, in, detector, and, mixer, applications, the, current, can, be, estimated, by, a, taylor, s, series, the, odd, terms, can, be, omitted, because, they, produce, frequency, components, that, are, outside, the, pass, band, of, the, mixer, or, detector, even, terms, beyond, the, second, derivative, usually, need, not, be, included, because, they, are, small, compared, to, the, second, order, term, the, desired, current, component, is, approximately, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, input, voltage, so, the, response, is, called, square, law, in, this, region, p, 3, following, the, end, of, forwarding, conduction, in, a, p, n, type, diode, a, reverse, current, can, flow, for, a, short, time, the, device, does, not, attain, its, blocking, capability, until, the, mobile, charge, in, the, junction, is, depleted, the, effect, can, be, significant, when, switching, large, currents, very, quickly, a, certain, amount, of, reverse, recovery, time, t, r, on, the, order, of, tens, of, nanoseconds, to, a, few, microseconds, may, be, required, to, remove, the, reverse, recovery, charge, q, r, from, the, diode, during, this, recovery, time, the, diode, can, actually, conduct, in, the, reverse, direction, this, might, give, rise, to, a, large, current, in, the, reverse, direction, for, a, short, time, while, the, diode, is, reverse, biased, the, magnitude, of, such, a, reverse, current, is, determined, by, the, operating, circuit, i, e, the, series, resistance, and, the, diode, is, said, to, be, in, the, storage, phase, in, certain, real, world, cases, it, is, important, to, consider, the, losses, that, are, incurred, by, this, non, ideal, diode, effect, however, when, the, slew, rate, of, the, current, is, not, so, severe, e, g, line, frequency, the, effect, can, be, safely, ignored, for, most, applications, the, effect, is, also, negligible, for, schottky, diodes, the, reverse, current, ceases, abruptly, when, the, stored, charge, is, depleted, this, abrupt, stop, is, exploited, in, step, recovery, diodes, for, the, generation, of, extremely, short, pulses, normal, p, n, diodes, which, operate, as, described, above, are, usually, made, of, doped, silicon, or, germanium, before, the, development, of, silicon, power, rectifier, diodes, cuprous, oxide, and, later, selenium, was, used, their, low, efficiency, required, a, much, higher, forward, voltage, to, be, applied, typically, 1, 4, to, 1, 7, v, per, cell, with, multiple, cells, stacked, so, as, to, increase, the, peak, inverse, voltage, rating, for, application, in, high, voltage, rectifiers, and, required, a, large, heat, sink, often, an, extension, of, the, diode, s, metal, substrate, much, larger, than, the, later, silicon, diode, of, the, same, current, ratings, would, require, the, vast, majority, of, all, diodes, are, the, p, n, diodes, found, in, cmos, integrated, circuits, which, include, two, diodes, per, pin, and, many, other, internal, diodes, the, symbol, used, to, represent, a, particular, type, of, diode, in, a, circuit, diagram, conveys, the, general, electrical, function, to, the, reader, there, are, alternative, symbols, for, some, types, of, diodes, though, the, differences, are, minor, the, triangle, in, the, symbols, points, to, the, forward, direction, i, e, in, the, direction, of, conventional, current, flow, there, are, a, number, of, common, standard, and, manufacturer, driven, numbering, and, coding, schemes, for, diodes, the, two, most, common, being, the, eia, jedec, standard, and, the, european, pro, electron, standard, the, standardized, 1n, series, numbering, eia370, system, was, introduced, in, the, us, by, eia, jedec, joint, electron, device, engineering, council, about, 1960, most, diodes, have, a, 1, prefix, designation, e, g, 1n4003, among, the, most, popular, in, this, series, were, 1n34a, 1n270, germanium, signal, 1n914, 1n4148, silicon, signal, 1n400x, silicon, 1a, power, rectifier, and, 1n580x, silicon, 3a, power, rectifier, the, jis, semiconductor, designation, system, has, all, semiconductor, diode, designations, starting, with, 1s, the, european, pro, electron, coding, system, for, active, components, was, introduced, in, 1966, and, comprises, two, letters, followed, by, the, part, code, the, first, letter, represents, the, semiconductor, material, used, for, the, component, a, germanium, and, b, silicon, and, the, second, letter, represents, the, general, function, of, the, part, for, diodes, a, low, power, signal, b, variable, capacitance, x, multiplier, y, rectifier, and, z, voltage, reference, for, example, other, common, numbering, coding, systems, generally, manufacturer, driven, include, in, optics, an, equivalent, device, for, the, diode, but, with, laser, light, would, be, the, optical, isolator, also, known, as, an, optical, diode, that, allows, light, to, only, pass, in, one, direction, it, uses, a, faraday, rotator, as, the, main, component, the, first, use, for, the, diode, was, the, demodulation, of, amplitude, modulated, am, radio, broadcasts, the, history, of, this, discovery, is, treated, in, depth, in, the, crystal, detector, article, in, summary, an, am, signal, consists, of, alternating, positive, and, negative, peaks, of, a, radio, carrier, wave, whose, amplitude, or, envelope, is, proportional, to, the, original, audio, signal, the, diode, rectifies, the, am, radio, frequency, signal, leaving, only, the, positive, peaks, of, the, carrier, wave, the, audio, is, then, extracted, from, the, rectified, carrier, wave, using, a, simple, filter, and, fed, into, an, audio, amplifier, or, transducer, which, generates, sound, waves, via, audio, speaker, in, microwave, and, millimeter, wave, technology, beginning, in, the, 1930s, researchers, improved, and, miniaturized, the, crystal, detector, point, contact, diodes, crystal, diodes, and, schottky, diodes, are, used, in, radar, microwave, and, millimeter, wave, detectors, rectifiers, are, constructed, from, diodes, where, they, are, used, to, convert, alternating, current, ac, electricity, into, direct, current, dc, automotive, alternators, are, a, common, example, where, the, diode, which, rectifies, the, ac, into, dc, provides, better, performance, than, the, commutator, or, earlier, dynamo, similarly, diodes, are, also, used, in, cockcroft, walton, voltage, multipliers, to, convert, ac, into, higher, dc, voltages, since, most, electronic, circuits, can, be, damaged, when, the, polarity, of, their, power, supply, inputs, are, reversed, a, series, diode, is, sometimes, used, to, protect, against, such, situations, this, concept, is, known, by, multiple, naming, variations, that, mean, the, same, thing, reverse, voltage, protection, reverse, polarity, protection, and, reverse, battery, protection, diodes, are, frequently, used, to, conduct, damaging, high, voltages, away, from, sensitive, electronic, devices, they, are, usually, reverse, biased, non, conducting, under, normal, circumstances, when, the, voltage, rises, above, the, normal, range, the, diodes, become, forward, biased, conducting, for, example, diodes, are, used, in, stepper, motor, and, h, bridge, motor, controller, and, relay, circuits, to, de, energize, coils, rapidly, without, the, damaging, voltage, spikes, that, would, otherwise, occur, a, diode, used, in, such, an, application, is, called, a, flyback, diode, many, integrated, circuits, also, incorporate, diodes, on, the, connection, pins, to, prevent, external, voltages, from, damaging, their, sensitive, transistors, specialized, diodes, are, used, to, protect, from, over, voltages, at, higher, power, see, diode, types, above, diode, resistor, logic, constructs, and, and, or, logic, gates, functional, completeness, can, be, achieved, by, adding, an, active, device, to, provide, inversion, as, done, with, diode, transistor, logic, in, addition, to, light, mentioned, above, semiconductor, diodes, are, sensitive, to, more, energetic, radiation, in, electronics, cosmic, rays, and, other, sources, of, ionizing, radiation, cause, noise, pulses, and, single, and, multiple, bit, errors, this, effect, is, sometimes, exploited, by, particle, detectors, to, detect, radiation, a, single, particle, of, radiation, with, thousands, or, millions, of, electron, volt, s, of, energy, generates, many, charge, carrier, pairs, as, its, energy, is, deposited, in, the, semiconductor, material, if, the, depletion, layer, is, large, enough, to, catch, the, whole, shower, or, to, stop, a, heavy, particle, a, fairly, accurate, measurement, of, the, particle, s, energy, can, be, made, simply, by, measuring, the, charge, conducted, and, without, the, complexity, of, a, magnetic, spectrometer, etc, these, semiconductor, radiation, detectors, need, efficient, and, uniform, charge, collection, and, low, leakage, current, they, are, often, cooled, by, liquid, nitrogen, for, longer, range, about, a, centimeter, particles, they, need, a, very, large, depletion, depth, and, large, area, for, short, range, particles, they, need, any, contact, or, un, depleted, semiconductor, on, at, least, one, surface, to, be, very, thin, the, back, bias, voltages, are, near, breakdown, around, a, thousand, volts, per, centimeter, germanium, and, silicon, are, common, materials, some, of, these, detectors, sense, position, as, well, as, energy, they, have, a, finite, life, especially, when, detecting, heavy, particles, because, of, radiation, damage, silicon, and, germanium, are, quite, different, in, their, ability, to, convert, gamma, rays, to, electron, showers, semiconductor, detectors, for, high, energy, particles, are, used, in, large, numbers, because, of, energy, loss, fluctuations, accurate, measurement, of, the, energy, deposited, is, of, less, use, a, diode, can, be, used, as, a, temperature, measuring, device, since, the, forward, voltage, drop, across, the, diode, depends, on, temperature, as, in, a, silicon, bandgap, temperature, sensor, from, the, shockley, ideal, diode, equation, given, above, it, might, appear, that, the, voltage, has, a, positive, temperature, coefficient, at, a, constant, current, but, usually, the, variation, of, the, reverse, saturation, current, term, is, more, significant, than, the, variation, in, the, thermal, voltage, term, most, diodes, therefore, have, a, negative, temperature, coefficient, typically, 2, mv, c, for, silicon, diodes, the, temperature, coefficient, is, approximately, constant, for, temperatures, above, about, 20, kelvin, some, graphs, are, given, for, 1n400x, series, and, cy7, cryogenic, temperature, sensor, diodes, will, prevent, currents, in, unintended, directions, to, supply, power, to, an, electrical, circuit, during, a, power, failure, the, circuit, can, draw, current, from, a, battery, an, uninterruptible, power, supply, may, use, diodes, in, this, way, to, ensure, that, the, current, is, only, drawn, from, the, battery, when, necessary, likewise, small, boats, typically, have, two, circuits, each, with, their, own, battery, batteries, one, used, for, engine, starting, one, used, for, domestics, normally, both, are, charged, from, a, single, alternator, and, a, heavy, duty, split, charge, diode, is, used, to, prevent, the, higher, charge, battery, typically, the, engine, battery, from, discharging, through, the, lower, charge, battery, when, the, alternator, is, not, running, diodes, are, also, used, in, electronic, musical, keyboards, to, reduce, the, amount, of, wiring, needed, in, electronic, musical, keyboards, these, instruments, often, use, keyboard, matrix, circuits, the, keyboard, controller, scans, the, rows, and, columns, to, determine, which, note, the, player, has, pressed, the, problem, with, matrix, circuits, is, that, when, several, notes, are, pressed, at, once, the, current, can, flow, backward, through, the, circuit, and, trigger, phantom, keys, that, cause, ghost, notes, to, play, to, avoid, triggering, unwanted, notes, most, keyboard, matrix, circuits, have, diodes, soldered, with, the, switch, under, each, key, of, the, musical, keyboard, the, same, principle, is, also, used, for, the, switch, matrix, in, solid, state, pinball, machines, diodes, can, be, used, to, limit, the, positive, or, negative, excursion, of, a, signal, to, a, prescribed, voltage, a, diode, clamp, circuit, can, take, a, periodic, alternating, current, signal, that, oscillates, between, positive, and, negative, values, and, vertically, displace, it, such, that, either, the, positive, or, the, negative, peaks, occur, at, a, prescribed, level, the, clamper, does, not, restrict, the, peak, to, peak, excursion, of, the, signal, it, moves, the, whole, signal, up, or, down, so, as, to, place, the, peaks, at, the, reference, level, the, diode, s, exponential, current, voltage, relationship, is, exploited, to, evaluate, exponentiation, and, its, inverse, function, the, logarithm, using, analog, voltage, signals, see, operational, amplifier, applications, exponential, output, and, logarithmic, output, diodes, are, usually, referred, to, as, d, for, diode, on, pcbs, sometimes, the, abbreviation, cr, for, crystal, rectifier, is, used
