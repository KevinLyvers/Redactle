a, barcode, or, bar, code, is, a, method, of, representing, data, in, a, visual, machine, readable, form, initially, barcodes, represented, data, by, varying, the, widths, spacings, and, sizes, of, parallel, lines, these, barcodes, now, commonly, referred, to, as, linear, or, one, dimensional, 1d, can, be, scanned, by, special, optical, scanners, called, barcode, readers, of, which, there, are, several, types, later, two, dimensional, 2d, variants, were, developed, using, rectangles, dots, hexagons, and, other, patterns, called, 2d, barcodes, or, matrix, codes, although, they, do, not, use, bars, as, such, both, can, be, read, using, purpose, built, 2d, optical, scanners, which, exist, in, a, few, different, forms, matrix, codes, can, also, be, read, by, a, digital, camera, connected, to, a, microcomputer, running, software, that, takes, a, photographic, image, of, the, barcode, and, analyzes, the, image, to, deconstruct, and, decode, the, code, a, mobile, device, with, a, built, in, camera, such, as, a, smartphone, can, function, as, the, latter, type, of, barcode, reader, using, specialized, application, software, and, is, suitable, for, both, 1d, and, 2d, codes, the, barcode, was, invented, by, norman, joseph, woodland, and, bernard, silver, and, patented, in, the, us, in, 1952, the, invention, was, based, on, morse, code, that, was, extended, to, thin, and, thick, bars, however, it, took, over, twenty, years, before, this, invention, became, commercially, successful, uk, magazine, modern, railways, december, 1962, pages, 387, 389, record, how, british, railways, had, already, perfected, a, barcode, reading, system, capable, of, correctly, reading, rolling, stock, travelling, at, 100, mph, 160, km, h, with, no, mistakes, an, early, use, of, one, type, of, barcode, in, an, industrial, context, was, sponsored, by, the, association, of, american, railroads, in, the, late, 1960s, developed, by, general, telephone, and, electronics, gte, and, called, kartrak, aci, automatic, car, identification, this, scheme, involved, placing, colored, stripes, in, various, combinations, on, steel, plates, which, were, affixed, to, the, sides, of, railroad, rolling, stock, two, plates, were, used, per, car, one, on, each, side, with, the, arrangement, of, the, colored, stripes, encoding, information, such, as, ownership, type, of, equipment, and, identification, number, the, plates, were, read, by, a, trackside, scanner, located, for, instance, at, the, entrance, to, a, classification, yard, while, the, car, was, moving, past, the, project, was, abandoned, after, about, ten, years, because, the, system, proved, unreliable, after, long, term, use, barcodes, became, commercially, successful, when, they, were, used, to, automate, supermarket, checkout, systems, a, task, for, which, they, have, become, almost, universal, the, uniform, grocery, product, code, council, had, chosen, in, 1973, the, barcode, design, developed, by, george, laurer, laurer, s, barcode, with, vertical, bars, printed, better, than, the, circular, barcode, developed, by, woodland, and, silver, their, use, has, spread, to, many, other, tasks, that, are, generically, referred, to, as, automatic, identification, and, data, capture, aidc, the, first, successful, system, using, barcodes, was, in, the, uk, supermarket, group, sainsbury, s, in, 1972, using, shelf, mounted, barcodes, which, were, developed, by, plessey, in, june, 1974, marsh, supermarket, in, troy, ohio, used, a, scanner, made, by, photographic, sciences, corporation, to, scan, the, universal, product, code, upc, barcode, on, a, pack, of, wrigley, s, chewing, gum, qr, codes, a, specific, type, of, 2d, barcode, have, recently, become, very, popular, due, to, the, growth, in, smartphone, ownership, other, systems, have, made, inroads, in, the, aidc, market, but, the, simplicity, universality, and, low, cost, of, barcodes, has, limited, the, role, of, these, other, systems, particularly, before, technologies, such, as, radio, frequency, identification, rfid, became, available, after, 2023, in, 1948, bernard, silver, a, graduate, student, at, drexel, institute, of, technology, in, philadelphia, pennsylvania, us, overheard, the, president, of, the, local, food, chain, food, fair, asking, one, of, the, deans, to, research, a, system, to, automatically, read, product, information, during, checkout, silver, told, his, friend, norman, joseph, woodland, about, the, request, and, they, started, working, on, a, variety, of, systems, their, first, working, system, used, ultraviolet, ink, but, the, ink, faded, too, easily, and, was, expensive, convinced, that, the, system, was, workable, with, further, development, woodland, left, drexel, moved, into, his, father, s, apartment, in, florida, and, continued, working, on, the, system, his, next, inspiration, came, from, morse, code, and, he, formed, his, first, barcode, from, sand, on, the, beach, i, just, extended, the, dots, and, dashes, downwards, and, made, narrow, lines, and, wide, lines, out, of, them, to, read, them, he, adapted, technology, from, optical, soundtracks, in, movies, using, a, 500, watt, incandescent, light, bulb, shining, through, the, paper, onto, an, rca935, photomultiplier, tube, from, a, movie, projector, on, the, far, side, he, later, decided, that, the, system, would, work, better, if, it, were, printed, as, a, circle, instead, of, a, line, allowing, it, to, be, scanned, in, any, direction, on, 20, october, 1949, woodland, and, silver, filed, a, patent, application, for, classifying, apparatus, and, method, in, which, they, described, both, the, linear, and, bull, s, eye, printing, patterns, as, well, as, the, mechanical, and, electronic, systems, needed, to, read, the, code, the, patent, was, issued, on, 7, october, 1952, as, us, patent, 2, 612, 994, in, 1951, woodland, moved, to, ibm, and, continually, tried, to, interest, ibm, in, developing, the, system, the, company, eventually, commissioned, a, report, on, the, idea, which, concluded, that, it, was, both, feasible, and, interesting, but, that, processing, the, resulting, information, would, require, equipment, that, was, some, time, off, in, the, future, ibm, offered, to, buy, the, patent, but, the, offer, was, not, accepted, philco, purchased, the, patent, in, 1962, and, then, sold, it, to, rca, sometime, later, during, his, time, as, an, undergraduate, david, jarrett, collins, worked, at, the, pennsylvania, railroad, and, became, aware, of, the, need, to, automatically, identify, railroad, cars, immediately, after, receiving, his, master, s, degree, from, mit, in, 1959, he, started, work, at, gte, sylvania, and, began, addressing, the, problem, he, developed, a, system, called, kartrak, using, blue, white, and, red, reflective, stripes, attached, to, the, side, of, the, cars, encoding, a, four, digit, company, identifier, and, a, six, digit, car, number, light, reflected, off, the, colored, stripes, was, read, by, photomultiplier, vacuum, tubes, the, boston, and, maine, railroad, tested, the, kartrak, system, on, their, gravel, cars, in, 1961, the, tests, continued, until, 1967, when, the, association, of, american, railroads, aar, selected, it, as, a, standard, automatic, car, identification, across, the, entire, north, american, fleet, the, installations, began, on, 10, october, 1967, however, the, economic, downturn, and, rash, of, bankruptcies, in, the, industry, in, the, early, 1970s, greatly, slowed, the, rollout, and, it, was, not, until, 1974, that, 95, of, the, fleet, was, labeled, to, add, to, its, woes, the, system, was, found, to, be, easily, fooled, by, dirt, in, certain, applications, which, greatly, affected, accuracy, the, aar, abandoned, the, system, in, the, late, 1970s, and, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 1980s, that, they, introduced, a, similar, system, this, time, based, on, radio, tags, the, railway, project, had, failed, but, a, toll, bridge, in, new, jersey, requested, a, similar, system, so, that, it, could, quickly, scan, for, cars, that, had, purchased, a, monthly, pass, then, the, u, s, post, office, requested, a, system, to, track, trucks, entering, and, leaving, their, facilities, these, applications, required, special, retroreflector, labels, finally, kal, kan, asked, the, sylvania, team, for, a, simpler, and, cheaper, version, which, they, could, put, on, cases, of, pet, food, for, inventory, control, in, 1967, with, the, railway, system, maturing, collins, went, to, management, looking, for, funding, for, a, project, to, develop, a, black, and, white, version, of, the, code, for, other, industries, they, declined, saying, that, the, railway, project, was, large, enough, and, they, saw, no, need, to, branch, out, so, quickly, collins, then, quit, sylvania, and, formed, the, computer, identics, corporation, as, its, first, innovations, computer, identics, moved, from, using, incandescent, light, bulbs, in, its, systems, replacing, them, with, helium, neon, lasers, and, incorporated, a, mirror, as, well, making, it, capable, of, locating, a, barcode, up, to, a, meter, 3, feet, in, front, of, the, scanner, this, made, the, entire, process, much, simpler, and, more, reliable, and, typically, enabled, these, devices, to, deal, with, damaged, labels, as, well, by, recognizing, and, reading, the, intact, portions, computer, identics, corporation, installed, one, of, its, first, two, scanning, systems, in, the, spring, of, 1969, at, a, general, motors, buick, factory, in, flint, michigan, the, system, was, used, to, identify, a, dozen, types, of, transmissions, moving, on, an, overhead, conveyor, from, production, to, shipping, the, other, scanning, system, was, installed, at, general, trading, company, s, distribution, center, in, carlstadt, new, jersey, to, direct, shipments, to, the, proper, loading, bay, in, 1966, the, national, association, of, food, chains, nafc, held, a, meeting, on, the, idea, of, automated, checkout, systems, rca, who, had, purchased, the, rights, to, the, original, woodland, patent, attended, the, meeting, and, initiated, an, internal, project, to, develop, a, system, based, on, the, bullseye, code, the, kroger, grocery, chain, volunteered, to, test, it, in, the, mid, 1970s, the, nafc, established, the, ad, hoc, committee, for, u, s, supermarkets, on, a, uniform, grocery, product, code, to, set, guidelines, for, barcode, development, in, addition, it, created, a, symbol, selection, subcommittee, to, help, standardize, the, approach, in, cooperation, with, consulting, firm, mckinsey, co, they, developed, a, standardized, 11, digit, code, for, identifying, products, the, committee, then, sent, out, a, contract, tender, to, develop, a, barcode, system, to, print, and, read, the, code, the, request, went, to, singer, national, cash, register, ncr, litton, industries, rca, pitney, bowes, ibm, and, many, others, a, wide, variety, of, barcode, approaches, was, studied, including, linear, codes, rca, s, bullseye, concentric, circle, code, starburst, patterns, and, others, in, the, spring, of, 1971, rca, demonstrated, their, bullseye, code, at, another, industry, meeting, ibm, executives, at, the, meeting, noticed, the, crowds, at, the, rca, booth, and, immediately, developed, their, own, system, ibm, marketing, specialist, alec, jablonover, remembered, that, the, company, still, employed, woodland, and, he, established, a, new, facility, in, raleigh, durham, research, triangle, park, to, lead, development, in, july, 1972, rca, began, an, 18, month, test, in, a, kroger, store, in, cincinnati, barcodes, were, printed, on, small, pieces, of, adhesive, paper, and, attached, by, hand, by, store, employees, when, they, were, adding, price, tags, the, code, proved, to, have, a, serious, problem, the, printers, would, sometimes, smear, ink, rendering, the, code, unreadable, in, most, orientations, however, a, linear, code, like, the, one, being, developed, by, woodland, at, ibm, was, printed, in, the, direction, of, the, stripes, so, extra, ink, would, simply, make, the, code, taller, while, remaining, readable, so, on, 3, april, 1973, the, ibm, upc, was, selected, as, the, nafc, standard, ibm, had, designed, five, versions, of, upc, symbology, for, future, industry, requirements, upc, a, b, c, d, and, e, ncr, installed, a, testbed, system, at, marsh, s, supermarket, in, troy, ohio, near, the, factory, that, was, producing, the, equipment, on, 26, june, 1974, clyde, dawson, pulled, a, 10, pack, of, wrigley, s, juicy, fruit, gum, out, of, his, basket, and, it, was, scanned, by, sharon, buchanan, at, 8, 01, am, the, pack, of, gum, and, the, receipt, are, now, on, display, in, the, smithsonian, institution, it, was, the, first, commercial, appearance, of, the, upc, in, 1971, an, ibm, team, was, assembled, for, an, intensive, planning, session, threshing, out, 12, to, 18, hours, a, day, how, the, technology, would, be, deployed, and, operate, cohesively, across, the, system, and, scheduling, a, roll, out, plan, by, 1973, the, team, were, meeting, with, grocery, manufacturers, to, introduce, the, symbol, that, would, need, to, be, printed, on, the, packaging, or, labels, of, all, of, their, products, there, were, no, cost, savings, for, a, grocery, to, use, it, unless, at, least, 70, of, the, grocery, s, products, had, the, barcode, printed, on, the, product, by, the, manufacturer, ibm, projected, that, 75, would, be, needed, in, 1975, economic, studies, conducted, for, the, grocery, industry, committee, projected, over, 40, million, in, savings, to, the, industry, from, scanning, by, the, mid, 1970s, those, numbers, were, not, achieved, in, that, time, frame, and, some, predicted, the, demise, of, barcode, scanning, the, usefulness, of, the, barcode, required, the, adoption, of, expensive, scanners, by, a, critical, mass, of, retailers, while, manufacturers, simultaneously, adopted, barcode, labels, neither, wanted, to, move, first, and, results, were, not, promising, for, the, first, couple, of, years, with, business, week, proclaiming, the, supermarket, scanner, that, failed, in, a, 1976, article, sims, supermarkets, were, the, first, location, in, australia, to, use, barcodes, starting, in, 1979, a, barcode, system, is, a, network, of, hardware, and, software, consisting, primarily, of, mobile, computers, printers, handheld, scanners, infrastructure, and, supporting, software, barcode, systems, are, used, to, automate, data, collection, where, hand, recording, is, neither, timely, nor, cost, effective, despite, often, being, provided, by, the, same, company, barcoding, systems, are, not, radio, frequency, identification, rfid, systems, many, companies, use, both, technologies, as, part, of, larger, resource, management, systems, a, typical, barcode, system, consist, of, some, infrastructure, either, wired, or, wireless, that, connects, some, number, of, mobile, computers, handheld, scanners, and, printers, to, one, or, many, databases, that, store, and, analyze, the, data, collected, by, the, system, at, some, level, there, must, be, some, software, to, manage, the, system, the, software, may, be, as, simple, as, code, that, manages, the, connection, between, the, hardware, and, the, database, or, as, complex, as, an, erp, mrp, or, some, other, inventory, management, software, there, is, a, wide, range, of, hardware, that, is, manufactured, today, for, use, in, barcode, systems, the, best, known, brand, of, handheld, scanners, and, mobile, computers, is, symbol, which, is, now, a, division, of, motorola, other, manufacturers, include, datalogic, intermec, hhp, hand, held, products, microscan, systems, unitech, metrologic, psc, and, panmobil, while, there, is, a, range, of, hardware, on, the, market, software, is, more, difficult, to, find, from, the, hardware, manufacturers, some, erp, mrp, and, other, inventory, management, software, have, built, in, support, for, barcode, reading, and, some, even, allow, the, software, to, run, directly, on, a, mobile, computer, besides, full, management, software, there, are, more, than, a, few, software, development, kits, on, the, market, that, allow, the, developer, to, easily, produce, custom, mobile, interfaces, and, that, handle, the, connect, to, the, database, one, such, software, is, rfgen, another, is, peoplevox, then, there, is, always, the, option, of, developing, a, custom, software, solution, using, a, language, such, as, c, c, java, visual, basic, net, and, many, others, often, developing, a, custom, interface, using, software, such, as, rfgen, or, developing, new, personalized, software, is, the, most, effective, method, since, it, allows, the, individual, to, have, a, solution, that, is, fitted, to, their, exact, needs, in, 1981, the, united, states, department, of, defense, adopted, the, use, of, code, 39, for, marking, all, products, sold, to, the, united, states, military, this, system, logistics, applications, of, automated, marking, and, reading, symbols, logmars, is, still, used, by, dod, and, is, widely, viewed, as, the, catalyst, for, widespread, adoption, of, barcoding, in, industrial, uses, barcodes, are, widely, used, around, the, world, in, many, contexts, in, stores, upc, barcodes, are, pre, printed, on, most, items, other, than, fresh, produce, from, a, grocery, store, this, speeds, up, processing, at, check, outs, and, helps, track, items, and, also, reduces, instances, of, shoplifting, involving, price, tag, swapping, although, shoplifters, can, now, print, their, own, barcodes, barcodes, that, encode, a, book, s, isbn, are, also, widely, pre, printed, on, books, journals, and, other, printed, materials, in, addition, retail, chain, membership, cards, use, barcodes, to, identify, customers, allowing, for, customized, marketing, and, greater, understanding, of, individual, consumer, shopping, patterns, at, the, point, of, sale, shoppers, can, get, product, discounts, or, special, marketing, offers, through, the, address, or, e, mail, address, provided, at, registration, barcodes, are, widely, used, in, the, healthcare, and, hospital, settings, ranging, from, patient, identification, to, access, patient, data, including, medical, history, drug, allergies, etc, to, creating, soap, notes, with, barcodes, to, medication, management, they, are, also, used, to, facilitate, the, separation, and, indexing, of, documents, that, have, been, imaged, in, batch, scanning, applications, track, the, organization, of, species, in, biology, and, integrate, with, in, motion, checkweighers, to, identify, the, item, being, weighed, in, a, conveyor, line, for, data, collection, they, can, also, be, used, to, keep, track, of, objects, and, people, they, are, used, to, keep, track, of, rental, cars, airline, luggage, nuclear, waste, registered, mail, express, mail, and, parcels, barcoded, tickets, which, may, be, printed, by, the, customer, on, their, home, printer, or, stored, on, their, mobile, device, allow, the, holder, to, enter, sports, arenas, cinemas, theatres, fairgrounds, and, transportation, and, are, used, to, record, the, arrival, and, departure, of, vehicles, from, rental, facilities, etc, this, can, allow, proprietors, to, identify, duplicate, or, fraudulent, tickets, more, easily, barcodes, are, widely, used, in, shop, floor, control, applications, software, where, employees, can, scan, work, orders, and, track, the, time, spent, on, a, job, barcodes, are, also, used, in, some, kinds, of, non, contact, 1d, and, 2d, position, sensors, a, series, of, barcodes, are, used, in, some, kinds, of, absolute, 1d, linear, encoder, the, barcodes, are, packed, close, enough, together, that, the, reader, always, has, one, or, two, barcodes, in, its, field, of, view, as, a, kind, of, fiducial, marker, the, relative, position, of, the, barcode, in, the, field, of, view, of, the, reader, gives, incremental, precise, positioning, in, some, cases, with, sub, pixel, resolution, the, data, decoded, from, the, barcode, gives, the, absolute, coarse, position, an, address, carpet, used, in, digital, paper, such, as, howell, s, binary, pattern, and, the, anoto, dot, pattern, is, a, 2d, barcode, designed, so, that, a, reader, even, though, only, a, tiny, portion, of, the, complete, carpet, is, in, the, field, of, view, of, the, reader, can, find, its, absolute, x, y, position, and, rotation, in, the, carpet, matrix, codes, can, embed, a, hyperlink, to, a, web, page, a, mobile, device, with, a, built, in, camera, might, be, used, to, read, the, pattern, and, browse, the, linked, website, which, can, help, a, shopper, find, the, best, price, for, an, item, in, the, vicinity, since, 2005, airlines, use, an, iata, standard, 2d, barcode, on, boarding, passes, bar, coded, boarding, pass, bcbp, and, since, 2008, 2d, barcodes, sent, to, mobile, phones, enable, electronic, boarding, passes, some, applications, for, barcodes, have, fallen, out, of, use, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, software, source, code, was, occasionally, encoded, in, a, barcode, and, printed, on, paper, cauzin, softstrip, and, paperbyte, are, barcode, symbologies, specifically, designed, for, this, application, and, the, 1991, barcode, battler, computer, game, system, used, any, standard, barcode, to, generate, combat, statistics, artists, have, used, barcodes, in, art, such, as, scott, blake, s, barcode, jesus, as, part, of, the, post, modernism, movement, the, mapping, between, messages, and, barcodes, is, called, a, symbology, the, specification, of, a, symbology, includes, the, encoding, of, the, message, into, bars, and, spaces, any, required, start, and, stop, markers, the, size, of, the, quiet, zone, required, to, be, before, and, after, the, barcode, and, the, computation, of, a, checksum, linear, symbologies, can, be, classified, mainly, by, two, properties, some, symbologies, use, interleaving, the, first, character, is, encoded, using, black, bars, of, varying, width, the, second, character, is, then, encoded, by, varying, the, width, of, the, white, spaces, between, these, bars, thus, characters, are, encoded, in, pairs, over, the, same, section, of, the, barcode, interleaved, 2, of, 5, is, an, example, of, this, stacked, symbologies, repeat, a, given, linear, symbology, vertically, the, most, common, among, the, many, 2d, symbologies, are, matrix, codes, which, feature, square, or, dot, shaped, modules, arranged, on, a, grid, pattern, 2d, symbologies, also, come, in, circular, and, other, patterns, and, may, employ, steganography, hiding, modules, within, an, image, for, example, dataglyphs, linear, symbologies, are, optimized, for, laser, scanners, which, sweep, a, light, beam, across, the, barcode, in, a, straight, line, reading, a, slice, of, the, barcode, light, dark, patterns, scanning, at, an, angle, makes, the, modules, appear, wider, but, does, not, change, the, width, ratios, stacked, symbologies, are, also, optimized, for, laser, scanning, with, the, laser, making, multiple, passes, across, the, barcode, in, the, 1990s, development, of, charge, coupled, device, ccd, imagers, to, read, barcodes, was, pioneered, by, welch, allyn, imaging, does, not, require, moving, parts, as, a, laser, scanner, does, in, 2007, linear, imaging, had, begun, to, supplant, laser, scanning, as, the, preferred, scan, engine, for, its, performance, and, durability, 2d, symbologies, cannot, be, read, by, a, laser, as, there, is, typically, no, sweep, pattern, that, can, encompass, the, entire, symbol, they, must, be, scanned, by, an, image, based, scanner, employing, a, ccd, or, other, digital, camera, sensor, technology, the, earliest, and, still, the, cheapest, barcode, scanners, are, built, from, a, fixed, light, and, a, single, photosensor, that, is, manually, moved, across, the, barcode, barcode, scanners, can, be, classified, into, three, categories, based, on, their, connection, to, the, computer, the, older, type, is, the, rs, 232, barcode, scanner, this, type, requires, special, programming, for, transferring, the, input, data, to, the, application, program, keyboard, interface, scanners, connect, to, a, computer, using, a, ps, 2, or, at, keyboard, compatible, adaptor, cable, a, keyboard, wedge, the, barcode, s, data, is, sent, to, the, computer, as, if, it, had, been, typed, on, the, keyboard, like, the, keyboard, interface, scanner, usb, scanners, do, not, need, custom, code, for, transferring, input, data, to, the, application, program, on, pcs, running, windows, the, human, interface, device, emulates, the, data, merging, action, of, a, hardware, keyboard, wedge, and, the, scanner, automatically, behaves, like, an, additional, keyboard, most, modern, smartphones, are, able, to, decode, barcode, using, their, built, in, camera, google, s, mobile, android, operating, system, can, use, their, own, google, lens, application, to, scan, qr, codes, or, third, party, apps, like, barcode, scanner, to, read, both, one, dimensional, barcodes, and, qr, codes, google, s, pixel, devices, can, natively, read, qr, codes, inside, the, default, pixel, camera, app, nokia, s, symbian, operating, system, featured, a, barcode, scanner, while, mbarcode, is, a, qr, code, reader, for, the, maemo, operating, system, in, apple, ios, 11, the, native, camera, app, can, decode, qr, codes, and, can, link, to, urls, join, wireless, networks, or, perform, other, operations, depending, on, the, qr, code, contents, other, paid, and, free, apps, are, available, with, scanning, capabilities, for, other, symbologies, or, for, earlier, ios, versions, with, blackberry, devices, the, app, world, application, can, natively, scan, barcodes, and, load, any, recognized, web, urls, on, the, device, s, web, browser, windows, phone, 7, 5, is, able, to, scan, barcodes, through, the, bing, search, app, however, these, devices, are, not, designed, specifically, for, the, capturing, of, barcodes, as, a, result, they, do, not, decode, nearly, as, quickly, or, accurately, as, a, dedicated, barcode, scanner, or, portable, data, terminal, it, is, common, for, producers, and, users, of, bar, codes, to, have, a, quality, management, system, which, includes, verification, and, validation, of, bar, codes, barcode, verification, examines, scanability, and, the, quality, of, the, barcode, in, comparison, to, industry, standards, and, specifications, barcode, verifiers, are, primarily, used, by, businesses, that, print, and, use, barcodes, any, trading, partner, in, the, supply, chain, can, test, barcode, quality, it, is, important, to, verify, a, barcode, to, ensure, that, any, reader, in, the, supply, chain, can, successfully, interpret, a, barcode, with, a, low, error, rate, retailers, levy, large, penalties, for, non, compliant, barcodes, these, chargebacks, can, reduce, a, manufacturer, s, revenue, by, 2, to, 10, a, barcode, verifier, works, the, way, a, reader, does, but, instead, of, simply, decoding, a, barcode, a, verifier, performs, a, series, of, tests, for, linear, barcodes, these, tests, are, 2d, matrix, symbols, look, at, the, parameters, depending, on, the, parameter, each, ansi, test, is, graded, from, 0, 0, to, 4, 0, f, to, a, or, given, a, pass, or, fail, mark, each, grade, is, determined, by, analyzing, the, scan, reflectance, profile, srp, an, analog, graph, of, a, single, scan, line, across, the, entire, symbol, the, lowest, of, the, 8, grades, is, the, scan, grade, and, the, overall, iso, symbol, grade, is, the, average, of, the, individual, scan, grades, for, most, applications, a, 2, 5, c, is, the, minimal, acceptable, symbol, grade, compared, with, a, reader, a, verifier, measures, a, barcode, s, optical, characteristics, to, international, and, industry, standards, the, measurement, must, be, repeatable, and, consistent, doing, so, requires, constant, conditions, such, as, distance, illumination, angle, sensor, angle, and, verifier, aperture, based, on, the, verification, results, the, production, process, can, be, adjusted, to, print, higher, quality, barcodes, that, will, scan, down, the, supply, chain, bar, code, validation, may, include, evaluations, after, use, and, abuse, testing, such, as, sunlight, abrasion, impact, moisture, etc, barcode, verifier, standards, are, defined, by, the, international, organization, for, standardization, iso, in, iso, iec, 15426, 1, linear, or, iso, iec, 15426, 2, 2d, the, current, international, barcode, quality, specification, is, iso, iec, 15416, linear, and, iso, iec, 15415, 2d, the, european, standard, en, 1635, has, been, withdrawn, and, replaced, by, iso, iec, 15416, the, original, u, s, barcode, quality, specification, was, ansi, x3, 182, upcs, used, in, the, us, ansi, ucc5, as, of, 2011, the, iso, workgroup, jtc1, sc31, was, developing, a, direct, part, marking, dpm, quality, standard, iso, iec, tr, 29158, in, point, of, sale, management, barcode, systems, can, provide, detailed, up, to, date, information, on, the, business, accelerating, decisions, and, with, more, confidence, for, example, besides, sales, and, inventory, tracking, barcodes, are, very, useful, in, logistics, and, supply, chain, management, barcode, scanners, are, relatively, low, cost, and, extremely, accurate, compared, to, key, entry, with, only, about, 1, substitution, error, in, 15, 000, to, 36, trillion, characters, entered, the, exact, error, rate, depends, on, the, type, of, barcode, a, first, generation, one, dimensional, barcode, that, is, made, up, of, lines, and, spaces, of, various, widths, or, sizes, that, create, specific, patterns, 2d, barcodes, consist, of, bars, but, use, both, dimensions, for, encoding, a, matrix, code, or, simply, a, 2d, code, is, a, two, dimensional, way, to, represent, information, it, can, represent, more, data, per, unit, area, apart, from, dots, various, other, patterns, can, be, used, patented, dataglyphs, can, be, embedded, into, a, half, tone, image, or, background, shading, pattern, in, a, way, that, is, almost, perceptually, invisible, similar, to, steganography, in, architecture, a, building, in, lingang, new, city, by, german, architects, gerkan, marg, and, partners, incorporates, a, barcode, design, as, does, a,

board, of, canada, and, arte, france, launched, a, web, documentary, entitled, barcode, tv, which, allows, users, to, view, films, about, everyday, objects, by, scanning, the, product, s, barcode, with, their, iphone, camera, in, professional, wrestling, the, wwe, stable, d, generation, x, incorporated, a, barcode, into, their, entrance, video, as, well, as, on, a, t, shirt, in, the, tv, series, dark, angel, the, protagonist, and, the, other, transgenics, in, the, manticore, x, series, have, barcodes, on, the, back, of, their, necks, in, video, games, the, protagonist, of, the, hitman, video, game, series, has, a, barcode, tattoo, on, the, back, of, his, head, qr, codes, can, also, be, scanned, in, a, side, mission, in, watch, dogs, the, 2018, videogame, judgment, features, qr, codes, that, protagonist, takayuki, yagami, can, photograph, with, his, phone, camera, these, are, mostly, to, unlock, parts, for, yagami, s, drone, in, the, films, back, to, the, future, part,
