technical, drawing, drafting, or, drawing, is, the, act, and, discipline, of, composing, drawings, that, visually, communicate, how, something, functions, or, is, constructed, technical, drawing, is, essential, for, communicating, ideas, in, industry, and, engineering, to, make, the, drawings, easier, to, understand, people, use, familiar, symbols, perspectives, units, of, measurement, notation, systems, visual, styles, and, page, layout, together, such, conventions, constitute, a, visual, language, and, help, to, ensure, that, the, drawing, is, unambiguous, and, relatively, easy, to, understand, many, of, the, symbols, and, principles, of, technical, drawing, are, codified, in, an, international, standard, called, iso, 128, the, need, for, precise, communication, in, the, preparation, of, a, functional, document, distinguishes, technical, drawing, from, the, expressive, drawing, of, the, visual, arts, artistic, drawings, are, subjectively, interpreted, their, meanings, are, multiply, determined, technical, drawings, are, understood, to, have, one, intended, meaning, a, draftsman, is, a, person, who, makes, a, drawing, technical, or, expressive, a, professional, drafter, who, makes, technical, drawings, is, sometimes, called, a, drafting, technician, a, sketch, is, a, quickly, executed, freehand, drawing, that, is, usually, not, intended, as, a, finished, work, in, general, sketching, is, a, quick, way, to, record, an, idea, for, later, use, architect, s, sketches, primarily, serve, as, a, way, to, try, out, different, ideas, and, establish, a, composition, before, a, more, finished, work, especially, when, the, finished, work, is, expensive, and, time, consuming, architectural, sketches, for, example, are, a, kind, of, diagram, these, sketches, like, metaphors, are, used, by, architects, as, a, means, of, communication, in, aiding, design, collaboration, this, tool, helps, architects, to, abstract, attributes, of, hypothetical, provisional, design, solutions, and, summarize, their, complex, patterns, thereby, enhancing, the, design, process, the, basic, drafting, procedure, is, to, place, a, piece, of, paper, or, other, material, on, a, smooth, surface, with, right, angle, corners, and, straight, sides, typically, a, drawing, board, a, sliding, straightedge, known, as, a, t, square, is, then, placed, on, one, of, the, sides, allowing, it, to, be, slid, across, the, side, of, the, table, and, over, the, surface, of, the, paper, parallel, lines, can, be, drawn, by, moving, the, t, square, and, running, a, pencil, or, technical, pen, along, the, t, square, s, edge, the, t, square, is, used, to, hold, other, devices, such, as, set, squares, or, triangles, in, this, case, the, drafter, places, one, or, more, triangles, of, known, angles, on, the, t, square, which, is, itself, at, right, angles, to, the, edge, of, the, table, and, can, then, draw, lines, at, any, chosen, angle, to, others, on, the, page, modern, drafting, tables, are, equipped, with, a, drafting, machine, that, is, supported, on, both, sides, of, the, table, to, slide, over, a, large, piece, of, paper, because, it, is, secured, on, both, sides, lines, drawn, along, the, edge, are, guaranteed, to, be, parallel, the, drafter, uses, several, technical, drawing, tools, to, draw, curves, and, circles, primary, among, these, are, the, compasses, used, for, drawing, arcs, and, circles, and, the, french, curve, for, drawing, curves, a, spline, is, a, rubber, coated, articulated, metal, that, can, be, manually, bent, to, most, curves, drafting, templates, assist, the, drafter, with, creating, recurring, objects, in, a, drawing, without, having, to, reproduce, the, object, from, scratch, every, time, this, is, especially, useful, when, using, common, symbols, i, e, in, the, context, of, stagecraft, a, lighting, designer, will, draw, from, the, usitt, standard, library, of, lighting, fixture, symbols, to, indicate, the, position, of, a, common, fixture, across, multiple, positions, templates, are, sold, commercially, by, a, number, of, vendors, usually, customized, to, a, specific, task, but, it, is, also, not, uncommon, for, a, drafter, to, create, his, own, templates, this, basic, drafting, system, requires, an, accurate, table, and, constant, attention, to, the, positioning, of, the, tools, a, common, error, is, to, allow, the, triangles, to, push, the, top, of, the, t, square, down, slightly, thereby, throwing, off, all, angles, even, tasks, as, simple, as, drawing, two, angled, lines, meeting, at, a, point, require, a, number, of, moves, of, the, t, square, and, triangles, and, in, general, drafting, can, be, a, time, consuming, process, a, solution, to, these, problems, was, the, introduction, of, the, mechanical, drafting, machine, an, application, of, the, pantograph, sometimes, referred, to, incorrectly, as, a, pentagraph, in, these, situations, which, allowed, the, drafter, to, have, an, accurate, right, angle, at, any, point, on, the, page, quickly, these, machines, often, included, the, ability, to, change, the, angle, hence, removing, the, need, for, the, triangles, in, addition, to, the, mastery, of, the, mechanics, of, drawing, lines, arcs, and, circles, and, text, onto, a, piece, of, paper, with, respect, to, the, detailing, of, physical, objects, the, drafting, effort, requires, a, thorough, understanding, of, geometry, trigonometry, and, spatial, comprehension, and, in, all, cases, demands, precision, and, accuracy, and, attention, to, detail, of, high, order, although, drafting, is, sometimes, accomplished, by, a, project, engineer, architect, or, shop, personnel, such, as, a, machinist, skilled, drafters, and, or, designers, usually, accomplish, the, task, and, are, always, in, demand, to, some, degree, today, the, mechanics, of, the, drafting, task, have, largely, been, automated, and, accelerated, through, the, use, of, computer, aided, design, systems, cad, there, are, two, types, of, computer, aided, design, systems, used, for, the, production, of, technical, drawings, two, dimensions, 2d, and, three, dimensions, 3d, 2d, cad, systems, such, as, autocad, or, microstation, replace, the, paper, drawing, discipline, the, lines, circles, arcs, and, curves, are, created, within, the, software, it, is, down, to, the, technical, drawing, skill, of, the, user, to, produce, the, drawing, there, is, still, much, scope, for, error, in, the, drawing, when, producing, first, and, third, angle, orthographic, projections, auxiliary, projections, and, cross, section, views, a, 2d, cad, system, is, merely, an, electronic, drawing, board, its, greatest, strength, over, direct, to, paper, technical, drawing, is, in, the, making, of, revisions, whereas, in, a, conventional, hand, drawn, technical, drawing, if, a, mistake, is, found, or, a, modification, is, required, a, new, drawing, must, be, made, from, scratch, the, 2d, cad, system, allows, a, copy, of, the, original, to, be, modified, saving, considerable, time, 2d, cad, systems, can, be, used, to, create, plans, for, large, projects, such, as, buildings, and, aircraft, but, provide, no, way, to, check, the, various, components, will, fit, together, a, 3d, cad, system, such, as, keycreator, autodesk, inventor, or, solidworks, first, produces, the, geometry, of, the, part, the, technical, drawing, comes, from, user, defined, views, of, that, geometry, any, orthographic, projected, or, sectioned, view, is, created, by, the, software, there, is, no, scope, for, error, in, the, production, of, these, views, the, main, scope, for, error, comes, in, setting, the, parameter, of, first, or, third, angle, projection, and, displaying, the, relevant, symbol, on, the, technical, drawing, 3d, cad, allows, individual, parts, to, be, assembled, together, to, represent, the, final, product, buildings, aircraft, ships, and, cars, are, modelled, assembled, and, checked, in, 3d, before, technical, drawings, are, released, for, manufacture, both, 2d, and, 3d, cad, systems, can, be, used, to, produce, technical, drawings, for, any, discipline, the, various, disciplines, electrical, electronic, pneumatic, hydraulic, etc, have, industry, recognized, symbols, to, represent, common, components, bs, and, iso, produce, standards, to, show, recommended, practices, but, it, is, up, to, individuals, to, produce, the, drawings, to, a, standard, there, is, no, definitive, standard, for, layout, or, style, the, only, standard, across, engineering, workshop, drawings, is, in, the, creation, of, orthographic, projections, and, cross, section, views, in, representing, complex, three, dimensional, objects, in, two, dimensional, drawings, the, objects, can, be, described, by, at, least, one, view, plus, material, thickness, note, 2, 3, or, as, many, views, and, sections, that, are, required, to, show, all, features, of, object, the, art, and, design, that, goes, into, making, buildings, is, known, as, architecture, to, communicate, all, aspects, of, the, shape, or, design, detail, drawings, are, used, in, this, field, the, term, plan, is, often, used, when, referring, to, the, full, section, view, of, these, drawings, as, viewed, from, three, feet, above, finished, floor, to, show, the, locations, of, doorways, windows, stairwells, etc, architectural, drawings, describe, and, document, an, architect, s, design, engineering, can, be, a, very, broad, term, it, stems, from, the, latin, ingenerare, meaning, to, create, because, this, could, apply, to, everything, that, humans, create, it, is, given, a, narrower, definition, in, the, context, of, technical, drawing, engineering, drawings, generally, deal, with, mechanical, engineered, items, such, as, manufactured, parts, and, equipment, engineering, drawings, are, usually, created, in, accordance, with, standardized, conventions, for, layout, nomenclature, interpretation, appearance, such, as, typefaces, and, line, styles, size, etc, its, purpose, is, to, accurately, and, unambiguously, capture, all, the, geometric, features, of, a, product, or, a, component, the, end, goal, of, an, engineering, drawing, is, to, convey, all, the, required, information, that, will, allow, a, manufacturer, to, produce, that, component, software, engineering, practitioners, make, use, of, diagrams, for, designing, software, formal, standards, and, modelling, languages, such, as, unified, modelling, language, uml, exist, but, most, diagramming, happens, using, informal, ad, hoc, diagrams, that, illustrate, a, conceptual, model, practitioners, reported, that, diagramming, helped, with, analysing, requirements, 539, design, refactoring, documentation, onboarding, communication, with, stake, holders, 560, diagrams, are, often, transient, or, redrawn, as, required, redrawn, diagrams, can, act, as, a, form, of, shared, understanding, in, a, team, 561, technical, illustration, is, the, use, of, illustration, to, visually, communicate, information, of, a, technical, nature, technical, illustrations, can, be, component, technical, drawings, or, diagrams, the, aim, of, technical, illustration, is, to, generate, expressive, images, that, effectively, convey, certain, information, via, the, visual, channel, to, the, human, observer, the, main, purpose, of, technical, illustration, is, to, describe, or, explain, these, items, to, a, more, or, less, nontechnical, audience, the, visual, image, should, be, accurate, in, terms, of, dimensions, and, proportions, and, should, provide, an, overall, impression, of, what, an, object, is, or, does, to, enhance, the, viewer, s, interest, and, understanding, according, to, viola, 2005, illustrative, techniques, are, often, designed, in, a, way, that, even, a, person, with, no, technical, understanding, clearly, understands, the, piece, of, art, the, use, of, varying, line, widths, to, emphasize, mass, proximity, and, scale, helped, to, make, a, simple, line, drawing, more, understandable, to, the, lay, person, cross, hatching, stippling, and, other, low, abstraction, techniques, gave, greater, depth, and, dimension, to, the, subject, matter, a, cutaway, drawing, is, a, technical, illustration, in, which, part, of, the, surface, of, a, three, dimensional, model, is, removed, in, order, to, show, some, of, the, model, s, interior, in, relation, to, its, exterior, the, purpose, of, a, cutaway, drawing, is, to, allow, the, viewer, to, have, a, look, into, an, otherwise, solid, opaque, object, instead, of, letting, the, inner, object, shine, through, the, surrounding, surface, parts, of, outside, object, are, simply, removed, this, produces, a, visual, appearance, as, if, someone, had, cutout, a, piece, of, the, object, or, sliced, it, into, parts, cutaway, illustrations, avoid, ambiguities, with, respect, to, spatial, ordering, provide, a, sharp, contrast, between, foreground, and, background, objects, and, facilitate, a, good, understanding, of, spatial, ordering, the, two, types, of, technical, drawings, are, based, on, graphical, projection, this, is, used, to, create, an, image, of, a, three, dimensional, object, onto, a, two, dimensional, surface, two, dimensional, representation, uses, orthographic, projection, to, create, an, image, where, only, two, of, the, three, dimensions, of, the, object, are, seen, in, a, three, dimensional, representation, also, referred, to, as, a, pictorial, all, three, dimensions, of, an, object, are, visible, multiview, is, a, type, of, orthographic, projection, there, are, two, conventions, for, using, multiview, first, angle, and, third, angle, in, both, cases, the, front, or, main, side, of, the, object, is, the, same, first, angle, is, drawing, the, object, sides, based, on, where, they, land, example, looking, at, the, front, side, rotate, the, object, 90, degrees, to, the, right, what, is, seen, will, be, drawn, to, the, right, of, the, front, side, third, angle, is, drawing, the, object, sides, based, on, where, they, are, example, looking, at, the, front, side, rotate, the, object, 90, degrees, to, the, right, what, is, seen, is, actually, the, left, side, of, the, object, and, will, be, drawn, to, the, left, of, the, front, side, while, multiview, relates, to, external, surfaces, of, an, object, section, views, show, an, imaginary, plane, cut, through, an, object, this, is, often, useful, to, show, voids, in, an, object, auxiliary, views, utilize, an, additional, projection, plane, other, than, the, common, planes, in, a, multiview, since, the, features, of, an, object, need, to, show, the, true, shape, and, size, of, the, object, the, projection, plane, must, be, parallel, to, the, object, surface, therefore, any, surface, that, is, not, in, line, with, the, three, major, axis, needs, its, own, projection, plane, to, show, the, features, correctly, patterns, sometimes, called, developments, show, the, size, and, shape, of, a, flat, piece, of, material, needed, for, later, bending, or, folding, into, a, three, dimensional, shape, an, exploded, view, drawing, is, a, technical, drawing, of, an, object, that, shows, the, relationship, or, order, of, assembly, of, the, various, parts, it, shows, the, components, of, an, object, slightly, separated, by, distance, or, suspended, in, surrounding, space, in, the, case, of, a, three, dimensional, exploded, diagram, an, object, is, represented, as, if, there, had, been, a, small, controlled, explosion, emanating, from, the, middle, of, the, object, causing, the, object, s, parts, to, be, separated, relative, distances, away, from, their, original, locations, an, exploded, view, drawing, evd, can, show, the, intended, assembly, of, mechanical, or, other, parts, in, mechanical, systems, the, component, closest, to, the, center, is, usually, assembled, first, or, is, the, main, part, inside, which, the, other, parts, are, assembled, the, evd, can, also, help, to, represent, the, disassembly, of, parts, where, those, on, the, outside, are, normally, removed, first, there, have, been, many, standard, sizes, of, paper, at, different, times, and, in, different, countries, but, today, most, of, the, world, uses, the, international, standard, a4, and, its, siblings, north, america, uses, its, own, sizes, the, applicant, for, a, patent, will, be, required, by, law, to, furnish, a, drawing, of, the, invention, if, or, when, the, nature, of, the, case, requires, a, drawing, to, understand, the, invention, with, the, job, this, drawing, must, be, filed, with, the, application, this, includes, practically, all, inventions, except, compositions, of, matter, or, processes, but, a, drawing, may, also, be, useful, in, the, case, of, many, processes, the, drawing, must, show, every, feature, of, the, invention, specified, in, the, claims, and, is, required, by, the, patent, office, rules, to, be, in, a, particular, form, the, office, specifies, the, size, of, the, sheet, on, which, the, drawing, is, made, the, type, of, paper, the, margins, and, other, details, relating, to, the, making, of, the, drawing, the, reason, for, specifying, the, standards, in, detail, is, that, the, drawings, are, printed, and, published, in, a, uniform, style, when, the, patent, issues, and, the, drawings, must, also, be, such, that, they, can, be, readily, understood, by, persons, using, the, patent, descriptions, working, drawings, are, the, set, of, technical, drawings, used, during, the, manufacturing, phase, of, a, product, in, architecture, these, include, civil, drawings, architectural, drawings, structural, drawings, mechanical, systems, drawings, electrical, drawings, and, plumbing, drawings, assembly, drawings, show, how, different, parts, go, together, identify, those, parts, by, number, and, have, a, parts, list, often, referred, to, as, a, bill, of, materials, in, a, technical, service, manual, this, type, of, drawing, may, be, referred, to, as, an, exploded, view, drawing, or, diagram, these, parts, may, be, used, in, engineering, also, called, as, built, drawings, or, as, made, drawings, as, fitted, drawings, represent, a, record, of, the, completed, works, literally, as, fitted, these, are, based, upon, the, working, drawings, and, updated, to, reflect, any, changes, or, alterations, undertaken, during, construction, or, manufacture
