an, inductor, also, called, a, coil, choke, or, reactor, is, a, passive, two, terminal, electrical, component, that, stores, energy, in, a, magnetic, field, when, electric, current, flows, through, it, an, inductor, typically, consists, of, an, insulated, wire, wound, into, a, coil, when, the, current, flowing, through, the, coil, changes, the, time, varying, magnetic, field, induces, an, electromotive, force, emf, voltage, in, the, conductor, described, by, faraday, s, law, of, induction, according, to, lenz, s, law, the, induced, voltage, has, a, polarity, direction, which, opposes, the, change, in, current, that, created, it, as, a, result, inductors, oppose, any, changes, in, current, through, them, an, inductor, is, characterized, by, its, inductance, which, is, the, ratio, of, the, voltage, to, the, rate, of, change, of, current, in, the, international, system, of, units, si, the, unit, of, inductance, is, the, henry, h, named, for, 19th, century, american, scientist, joseph, henry, in, the, measurement, of, magnetic, circuits, it, is, equivalent, to, weber, ampere, inductors, have, values, that, typically, range, from, 1, h, 10, 6, h, to, 20, h, many, inductors, have, a, magnetic, core, made, of, iron, or, ferrite, inside, the, coil, which, serves, to, increase, the, magnetic, field, and, thus, the, inductance, along, with, capacitors, and, resistors, inductors, are, one, of, the, three, passive, linear, circuit, elements, that, make, up, electronic, circuits, inductors, are, widely, used, in, alternating, current, ac, electronic, equipment, particularly, in, radio, equipment, they, are, used, to, block, ac, while, allowing, dc, to, pass, inductors, designed, for, this, purpose, are, called, chokes, they, are, also, used, in, electronic, filters, to, separate, signals, of, different, frequencies, and, in, combination, with, capacitors, to, make, tuned, circuits, used, to, tune, radio, and, tv, receivers, the, term, inductor, seems, to, come, from, heinrich, daniel, ruhmkorff, who, called, the, induction, coil, he, invented, in, 1851, an, inductorium, an, electric, current, flowing, through, a, conductor, generates, a, magnetic, field, surrounding, it, the, magnetic, flux, linkage, b, displaystyle, phi, mathbf, b, generated, by, a, given, current, i, displaystyle, i, depends, on, the, geometric, shape, of, the, circuit, their, ratio, defines, the, inductance, l, displaystyle, l, thus, the, inductance, of, a, circuit, depends, on, the, geometry, of, the, current, path, as, well, as, the, magnetic, permeability, of, nearby, materials, an, inductor, is, a, component, consisting, of, a, wire, or, other, conductor, shaped, to, increase, the, magnetic, flux, through, the, circuit, usually, in, the, shape, of, a, coil, or, helix, with, two, terminals, winding, the, wire, into, a, coil, increases, the, number, of, times, the, magnetic, flux, lines, link, the, circuit, increasing, the, field, and, thus, the, inductance, the, more, turns, the, higher, the, inductance, the, inductance, also, depends, on, the, shape, of, the, coil, separation, of, the, turns, and, many, other, factors, by, adding, a, magnetic, core, made, of, a, ferromagnetic, material, like, iron, inside, the, coil, the, magnetizing, field, from, the, coil, will, induce, magnetization, in, the, material, increasing, the, magnetic, flux, the, high, permeability, of, a, ferromagnetic, core, can, increase, the, inductance, of, a, coil, by, a, factor, of, several, thousand, over, what, it, would, be, without, it, any, change, in, the, current, through, an, inductor, creates, a, changing, flux, inducing, a, voltage, across, the, inductor, by, faraday, s, law, of, induction, the, voltage, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, induced, by, any, change, in, magnetic, flux, through, the, circuit, is, given, by, reformulating, the, definition, of, l, above, we, obtain, it, follows, that, e, l, d, i, d, t, displaystyle, quad, mathcal, e, l, frac, di, dt, quad, if, l, is, independent, of, time, current, and, magnetic, flux, linkage, thus, inductance, is, also, a, measure, of, the, amount, of, electromotive, force, voltage, generated, for, a, given, rate, of, change, of, current, this, is, usually, taken, to, be, the, constitutive, relation, defining, equation, of, the, inductor, the, polarity, direction, of, the, induced, voltage, is, given, by, lenz, s, law, which, states, that, the, induced, voltage, will, be, such, as, to, oppose, the, change, in, current, for, example, if, the, current, through, a, 1, henry, inductor, is, increasing, at, a, rate, of, 1, amperes, per, second, the, induced, 1, volt, of, potential, difference, will, be, positive, at, the, current, s, entrance, point, and, negative, at, the, exit, point, tending, to, oppose, the, additional, current, the, energy, from, the, external, circuit, necessary, to, overcome, this, potential, hill, is, being, stored, in, the, magnetic, field, of, the, inductor, if, the, current, is, decreasing, the, induced, voltage, will, be, negative, at, the, current, s, entrance, point, and, positive, at, the, exit, point, tending, to, maintain, the, current, in, this, case, energy, from, the, magnetic, field, is, being, returned, to, the, circuit, because, the, induced, voltage, is, positive, at, the, current, s, entrance, terminal, the, inductor, s, current, voltage, relationship, is, often, expressed, without, a, negative, sign, by, using, the, current, s, exit, terminal, as, the, reference, point, for, the, voltage, v, t, displaystyle, v, t, at, the, current, s, entrance, terminal, as, labeled, in, the, schematic, the, derivative, form, of, this, current, voltage, relationship, is, then, v, t, l, d, i, t, d, t, displaystyle, v, t, l, frac, mathrm, d, i, t, mathrm, d, t, the, integral, form, of, this, current, voltage, relationship, starting, at, time, t, 0, displaystyle, t, 0, with, some, initial, current, i, t, 0, displaystyle, i, t, 0, is, then, i, t, i, t, 0, 1, l, t, 0, t, v, d, displaystyle, i, t, i, t, 0, frac, 1, l, int, t, 0, t, v, tau, mathrm, d, tau, the, dual, of, the, inductor, is, the, capacitor, which, stores, energy, in, an, electric, field, rather, than, a, magnetic, field, its, current, voltage, relation, replaces, l, with, the, capacitance, c, and, has, current, and, voltage, swapped, from, these, equations, one, intuitive, explanation, as, to, why, a, potential, difference, is, induced, on, a, change, of, current, in, an, inductor, goes, as, follows, when, there, is, a, change, in, current, through, an, inductor, there, is, a, change, in, the, strength, of, the, magnetic, field, for, example, if, the, current, is, increased, the, magnetic, field, increases, this, however, does, not, come, without, a, price, the, magnetic, field, contains, potential, energy, and, increasing, the, field, strength, requires, more, energy, to, be, stored, in, the, field, this, energy, comes, from, the, electric, current, through, the, inductor, the, increase, in, the, magnetic, potential, energy, of, the, field, is, provided, by, a, corresponding, drop, in, the, electric, potential, energy, of, the, charges, flowing, through, the, windings, this, appears, as, a, voltage, drop, across, the, windings, as, long, as, the, current, increases, once, the, current, is, no, longer, increased, and, is, held, constant, the, energy, in, the, magnetic, field, is, constant, and, no, additional, energy, must, be, supplied, so, the, voltage, drop, across, the, windings, disappears, similarly, if, the, current, through, the, inductor, decreases, the, magnetic, field, strength, decreases, and, the, energy, in, the, magnetic, field, decreases, this, energy, is, returned, to, the, circuit, in, the, form, of, an, increase, in, the, electrical, potential, energy, of, the, moving, charges, causing, a, voltage, rise, across, the, windings, the, work, done, per, unit, charge, on, the, charges, passing, through, the, inductor, is, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, the, negative, sign, indicates, that, the, work, is, done, against, the, emf, and, is, not, done, by, the, emf, the, current, i, displaystyle, i, is, the, charge, per, unit, time, passing, through, the, inductor, therefore, the, rate, of, work, w, displaystyle, w, done, by, the, charges, against, the, emf, that, is, the, rate, of, change, of, energy, of, the, current, is, given, by, from, the, constitutive, equation, for, the, inductor, e, l, d, i, d, t, displaystyle, mathcal, e, l, frac, di, dt, so, in, a, ferromagnetic, core, inductor, when, the, magnetic, field, approaches, the, level, at, which, the, core, saturates, the, inductance, will, begin, to, change, it, will, be, a, function, of, the, current, l, i, displaystyle, l, i, neglecting, losses, the, energy, w, displaystyle, w, stored, by, an, inductor, with, a, current, i, 0, displaystyle, i, 0, passing, through, it, is, equal, to, the, amount, of, work, required, to, establish, the, current, through, the, inductor, this, is, given, by, w, 0, i, 0, l, d, i, i, d, i, displaystyle, w, int, 0, i, 0, l, d, i, i, di, where, l, d, i, displaystyle, l, d, i, is, the, so, called, differential, inductance, and, is, defined, as, l, d, d, b, d, i, displaystyle, l, d, frac, d, phi, mathbf, b, di, in, an, air, core, inductor, or, a, ferromagnetic, core, inductor, below, saturation, the, inductance, is, constant, and, equal, to, the, differential, inductance, so, the, stored, energy, is, w, 1, 2, l, i, 0, 2, displaystyle, quad, w, frac, 1, 2, l, i, 0, 2, quad, for, inductors, with, magnetic, cores, the, above, equation, is, only, valid, for, linear, regions, of, the, magnetic, flux, at, currents, below, the, saturation, level, of, the, inductor, where, the, inductance, is, approximately, constant, where, this, is, not, the, case, the, integral, form, must, be, used, with, l, d, displaystyle, l, d, variable, when, a, voltage, step, is, applied, to, an, inductor, the, constitutive, equation, describes, the, behavior, of, an, ideal, inductor, with, inductance, l, displaystyle, l, and, without, resistance, capacitance, or, energy, dissipation, in, practice, inductors, do, not, follow, this, theoretical, model, real, inductors, have, a, measurable, resistance, due, to, the, resistance, of, the, wire, and, energy, losses, in, the, core, and, parasitic, capacitance, between, turns, of, the, wire, a, real, inductor, s, capacitive, reactance, rises, with, frequency, and, at, a, certain, frequency, the, inductor, will, behave, as, a, resonant, circuit, above, this, self, resonant, frequency, the, capacitive, reactance, is, the, dominant, part, of, the, inductor, s, impedance, at, higher, frequencies, resistive, losses, in, the, windings, increase, due, to, the, skin, effect, and, proximity, effect, inductors, with, ferromagnetic, cores, experience, additional, energy, losses, due, to, hysteresis, and, eddy, currents, in, the, core, which, increase, with, frequency, at, high, currents, magnetic, core, inductors, also, show, sudden, departure, from, ideal, behavior, due, to, nonlinearity, caused, by, magnetic, saturation, of, the, core, inductors, radiate, electromagnetic, energy, into, surrounding, space, and, may, absorb, electromagnetic, emissions, from, other, circuits, resulting, in, potential, electromagnetic, interference, an, early, solid, state, electrical, switching, and, amplifying, device, called, a, saturable, reactor, exploits, saturation, of, the, core, as, a, means, of, stopping, the, inductive, transfer, of, current, via, the, core, the, winding, resistance, appears, as, a, resistance, in, series, with, the, inductor, it, is, referred, to, as, dcr, dc, resistance, this, resistance, dissipates, some, of, the, reactive, energy, the, quality, factor, or, q, of, an, inductor, is, the, ratio, of, its, inductive, reactance, to, its, resistance, at, a, given, frequency, and, is, a, measure, of, its, efficiency, the, higher, the, q, factor, of, the, inductor, the, closer, it, approaches, the, behavior, of, an, ideal, inductor, high, q, inductors, are, used, with, capacitors, to, make, resonant, circuits, in, radio, transmitters, and, receivers, the, higher, the, q, is, the, narrower, the, bandwidth, of, the, resonant, circuit, the, q, factor, of, an, inductor, is, defined, as, where, l, displaystyle, l, is, the, inductance, r, displaystyle, r, is, the, dc, resistance, and, the, product, l, displaystyle, omega, l, is, the, inductive, reactance, q, increases, linearly, with, frequency, if, l, and, r, are, constant, although, they, are, constant, at, low, frequencies, the, parameters, vary, with, frequency, for, example, skin, effect, proximity, effect, and, core, losses, increase, r, with, frequency, winding, capacitance, and, variations, in, permeability, with, frequency, affect, l, at, low, frequencies, and, within, limits, increasing, the, number, of, turns, n, improves, q, because, l, varies, as, n, 2, while, r, varies, linearly, with, n, similarly, increasing, the, radius, r, of, an, inductor, improves, or, increases, q, because, l, varies, with, r, 2, while, r, varies, linearly, with, r, so, high, q, air, core, inductors, often, have, large, diameters, and, many, turns, both, of, those, examples, assume, the, diameter, of, the, wire, stays, the, same, so, both, examples, use, proportionally, more, wire, if, the, total, mass, of, wire, is, held, constant, then, there, would, be, no, advantage, to, increasing, the, number, of, turns, or, the, radius, of, the, turns, because, the, wire, would, have, to, be, proportionally, thinner, using, a, high, permeability, ferromagnetic, core, can, greatly, increase, the, inductance, for, the, same, amount, of, copper, so, the, core, can, also, increase, the, q, cores, however, also, introduce, losses, that, increase, with, frequency, the, core, material, is, chosen, for, best, results, for, the, frequency, band, high, q, inductors, must, avoid, saturation, one, way, is, by, using, a, physically, larger, air, core, inductor, at, vhf, or, higher, frequencies, an, air, core, is, likely, to, be, used, a, well, designed, air, core, inductor, may, have, a, q, of, several, hundred, inductors, are, used, extensively, in, analog, circuits, and, signal, processing, applications, range, from, the, use, of, large, inductors, in, power, supplies, which, in, conjunction, with, filter, capacitors, remove, ripple, which, is, a, multiple, of, the, mains, frequency, or, the, switching, frequency, for, switched, mode, power, supplies, from, the, direct, current, output, to, the, small, inductance, of, the, ferrite, bead, or, torus, installed, around, a, cable, to, prevent, radio, frequency, interference, from, being, transmitted, down, the, wire, inductors, are, used, as, the, energy, storage, device, in, many, switched, mode, power, supplies, to, produce, dc, current, the, inductor, supplies, energy, to, the, circuit, to, keep, current, flowing, during, the, off, switching, periods, and, enables, topographies, where, the, output, voltage, is, higher, than, the, input, voltage, a, tuned, circuit, consisting, of, an, inductor, connected, to, a, capacitor, acts, as, a, resonator, for, oscillating, current, tuned, circuits, are, widely, used, in, radio, frequency, equipment, such, as, radio, transmitters, and, receivers, as, narrow, bandpass, filters, to, select, a, single, frequency, from, a, composite, signal, and, in, electronic, oscillators, to, generate, sinusoidal, signals, two, or, more, inductors, in, proximity, that, have, coupled, magnetic, flux, mutual, inductance, form, a, transformer, which, is, a, fundamental, component, of, every, electric, utility, power, grid, the, efficiency, of, a, transformer, may, decrease, as, the, frequency, increases, due, to, eddy, currents, in, the, core, material, and, skin, effect, on, the, windings, the, size, of, the, core, can, be, decreased, at, higher, frequencies, for, this, reason, aircraft, use, 400, hertz, alternating, current, rather, than, the, usual, 50, or, 60, hertz, allowing, a, great, saving, in, weight, from, the, use, of, smaller, transformers, transformers, enable, switched, mode, power, supplies, that, galvanically, isolate, the, output, from, the, input, inductors, are, also, employed, in, electrical, transmission, systems, where, they, are, used, to, limit, switching, currents, and, fault, currents, in, this, field, they, are, more, commonly, referred, to, as, reactors, inductors, have, parasitic, effects, which, cause, them, to, depart, from, ideal, behavior, they, create, and, suffer, from, electromagnetic, interference, emi, their, physical, size, prevents, them, from, being, integrated, on, semiconductor, chips, so, the, use, of, inductors, is, declining, in, modern, electronic, devices, particularly, compact, portable, devices, real, inductors, are, increasingly, being, replaced, by, active, circuits, such, as, the, gyrator, which, can, synthesize, inductance, using, capacitors, an, inductor, usually, consists, of, a, coil, of, conducting, material, typically, insulated, copper, wire, wrapped, around, a, core, either, of, plastic, to, create, an, air, core, inductor, or, of, a, ferromagnetic, or, ferrimagnetic, material, the, latter, is, called, an, iron, core, inductor, the, high, permeability, of, the, ferromagnetic, core, increases, the, magnetic, field, and, confines, it, closely, to, the, inductor, thereby, increasing, the, inductance, low, frequency, inductors, are, constructed, like, transformers, with, cores, of, electrical, steel, laminated, to, prevent, eddy, currents, soft, ferrites, are, widely, used, for, cores, above, audio, frequencies, since, they, do, not, cause, the, large, energy, losses, at, high, frequencies, that, ordinary, iron, alloys, do, inductors, come, in, many, shapes, some, inductors, have, an, adjustable, core, which, enables, changing, of, the, inductance, inductors, used, to, block, very, high, frequencies, are, sometimes, made, by, stringing, a, ferrite, bead, on, a, wire, small, inductors, can, be, etched, directly, onto, a, printed, circuit, board, by, laying, out, the, trace, in, a, spiral, pattern, some, such, planar, inductors, use, a, planar, core, small, value, inductors, can, also, be, built, on, integrated, circuits, using, the, same, processes, that, are, used, to, make, interconnects, aluminium, interconnect, is, typically, used, laid, out, in, a, spiral, coil, pattern, however, the, small, dimensions, limit, the, inductance, and, it, is, far, more, common, to, use, a, circuit, called, a, gyrator, that, uses, a, capacitor, and, active, components, to, behave, similarly, to, an, inductor, regardless, of, the, design, because, of, the, low, inductances, and, low, power, dissipation, on, die, inductors, allow, they, are, currently, only, commercially, used, for, high, frequency, rf, circuits, inductors, used, in, power, regulation, systems, lighting, and, other, systems, that, require, low, noise, operating, conditions, are, often, partially, or, fully, shielded, in, telecommunication, circuits, employing, induction, coils, and, repeating, transformers, shielding, of, inductors, in, close, proximity, reduces, circuit, cross, talk, the, term, air, core, coil, describes, an, inductor, that, does, not, use, a, magnetic, core, made, of, a, ferromagnetic, material, the, term, refers, to, coils, wound, on, plastic, ceramic, or, other, nonmagnetic, forms, as, well, as, those, that, have, only, air, inside, the, windings, air, core, coils, have, lower, inductance, than, ferromagnetic, core, coils, but, are, often, used, at, high, frequencies, because, they, are, free, from, energy, losses, called, core, losses, that, occur, in, ferromagnetic, cores, which, increase, with, frequency, a, side, effect, that, can, occur, in, air, core, coils, in, which, the, winding, is, not, rigidly, supported, on, a, form, is, microphony, mechanical, vibration, of, the, windings, can, cause, variations, in, the, inductance, at, high, frequencies, particularly, radio, frequencies, rf, inductors, have, higher, resistance, and, other, losses, in, addition, to, causing, power, loss, in, resonant, circuits, this, can, reduce, the, q, factor, of, the, circuit, broadening, the, bandwidth, in, rf, inductors, specialized, construction, techniques, are, used, to, minimize, these, losses, the, losses, are, due, to, these, effects, to, reduce, parasitic, capacitance, and, proximity, effect, high, q, rf, coils, are, constructed, to, avoid, having, many, turns, lying, close, together, parallel, to, one, another, the, windings, of, rf, coils, are, often, limited, to, a, single, layer, and, the, turns, are, spaced, apart, to, reduce, resistance, due, to, skin, effect, in, high, power, inductors, such, as, those, used, in, transmitters, the, windings, are, sometimes, made, of, a, metal, strip, or, tubing, which, has, a, larger, surface, area, and, the, surface, is, silver, plated, small, inductors, for, low, current, and, low, power, are, made, in, molded, cases, resembling, resistors, these, may, be, either, plain, phenolic, core, or, ferrite, core, an, ohmmeter, readily, distinguishes, them, from, similar, sized, resistors, by, showing, the, low, resistance, of, the, inductor, ferromagnetic, core, or, iron, core, inductors, use, a, magnetic, core, made, of, a, ferromagnetic, or, ferrimagnetic, material, such, as, iron, or, ferrite, to, increase, the, inductance, a, magnetic, core, can, increase, the, inductance, of, a, coil, by, a, factor, of, several, thousand, by, increasing, the, magnetic, field, due, to, its, higher, magnetic, permeability, however, the, magnetic, properties, of, the, core, material, cause, several, side, effects, which, alter, the, behavior, of, the, inductor, and, require, special, construction, low, frequency, inductors, are, often, made, with, laminated, cores, to, prevent, eddy, currents, using, construction, similar, to, transformers, the, core, is, made, of, stacks, of, thin, steel, sheets, or, laminations, oriented, parallel, to, the, field, with, an, insulating, coating, on, the, surface, the, insulation, prevents, eddy, currents, between, the, sheets, so, any, remaining, currents, must, be, within, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, individual, laminations, reducing, the, area, of, the, loop, and, thus, reducing, the, energy, losses, greatly, the, laminations, are, made, of, low, conductivity, silicon, steel, to, further, reduce, eddy, current, losses, for, higher, frequencies, inductors, are, made, with, cores, of, ferrite, ferrite, is, a, ceramic, ferrimagnetic, material, that, is, nonconductive, so, eddy, currents, cannot, flow, within, it, the, formulation, of, ferrite, is, xxfe, 2, o, 4, where, xx, represents, various, metals, for, inductor, cores, soft, ferrites, are, used, which, have, low, coercivity, and, thus, low, hysteresis, losses, another, material, is, powdered, iron, cemented, with, a, binder, medium, frequency, equipment, almost, exclusively, uses, powdered, iron, cores, and, inductors, and, transformers, built, for, the, lower, shortwaves, are, made, using, either, cemented, powdered, iron, or, ferrites, in, an, inductor, wound, on, a, straight, rod, shaped, core, the, magnetic, field, lines, emerging, from, one, end, of, the, core, must, pass, through, the, air, to, re, enter, the, core, at, the, other, end, this, reduces, the, field, because, much, of, the, magnetic, field, path, is, in, air, rather, than, the, higher, permeability, core, material, and, is, a, source, of, electromagnetic, interference, a, higher, magnetic, field, and, inductance, can, be, achieved, by, forming, the, core, in, a, closed, magnetic, circuit, the, magnetic, field, lines, form, closed, loops, within, the, core, without, leaving, the, core, material, the, shape, often, used, is, a, toroidal, or, doughnut, shaped, ferrite, core, because, of, their, symmetry, toroidal, cores, allow, a, minimum, of, the, magnetic, flux, to, escape, outside, the, core, called, leakage, flux, so, they, radiate, less, electromagnetic, interference, than, other, shapes, toroidal, core, coils, are, manufactured, of, various, materials, primarily, ferrite, powdered, iron, and, laminated, cores, probably, the, most, common, type, of, variable, inductor, today, is, one, with, a, moveable, ferrite, magnetic, core, which, can, be, slid, or, screwed, in, or, out, of, the, coil, moving, the, core, farther, into, the, coil, increases, the, permeability, increasing, the, magnetic, field, and, the, inductance, many, inductors, used, in, radio, applications, usually, less, than, 100, mhz, use, adjustable, cores, in, order, to, tune, such, inductors, to, their, desired, value, since, manufacturing, processes, have, certain, tolerances, inaccuracy, sometimes, such, cores, for, frequencies, above, 100, mhz, are, made, from, highly, conductive, non, magnetic, material, such, as, aluminum, they, decrease, the, inductance, because, the, magnetic, field, must, bypass, them, air, core, inductors, can, use, sliding, contacts, or, multiple, taps, to, increase, or, decrease, the, number, of, turns, included, in, the, circuit, to, change, the, inductance, a, type, much, used, in, the, past, but, mostly, obsolete, today, has, a, spring, contact, that, can, slide, along, the, bare, surface, of, the, windings, the, disadvantage, of, this, type, is, that, the, contact, usually, short, circuits, one, or, more, turns, these, turns, act, like, a, single, turn, short, circuited, transformer, secondary, winding, the, large, currents, induced, in, them, cause, power, losses, a, type, of, continuously, variable, air, core, inductor, is, the, variometer, this, consists, of, two, coils, with, the, same, number, of, turns, connected, in, series, one, inside, the, other, the, inner, coil, is, mounted, on, a, shaft, so, its, axis, can, be, turned, with, respect, to, the, outer, coil, when, the, two, coils, axes, are, collinear, with, the, magnetic, fields, pointing, in, the, same, direction, the, fields, add, and, the, inductance, is, maximum, when, the, inner, coil, is, turned, so, its, axis, is, at, an, angle, with, the, outer, the, mutual, inductance, between, them, is, smaller, so, the, total, inductance, is, less, when, the, inner, coil, is, turned, 180, so, the, coils, are, collinear, with, their, magnetic, fields, opposing, the, two, fields, cancel, each, other, and, the, inductance, is, very, small, this, type, has, the, advantage, that, it, is, continuously, variable, over, a, wide, range, it, is, used, in, antenna, tuners, and, matching, circuits, to, match, low, frequency, transmitters, to, their, antennas, another, method, to, control, the, inductance, without, any, moving, parts, requires, an, additional, dc, current, bias, winding, which, controls, the, permeability, of, an, easily, saturable, core, material, see, magnetic, amplifier, a, choke, is, an, inductor, designed, specifically, for, blocking, high, frequency, alternating, current, ac, in, an, electrical, circuit, while, allowing, dc, or, low, frequency, signals, to, pass, because, the, inductor, restricts, or, chokes, the, changes, in, current, this, type, of, inductor, is, called, a, choke, it, usually, consists, of, a, coil, of, insulated, wire, wound, on, a, magnetic, core, although, some, consist, of, a, donut, shaped, bead, of, ferrite, material, strung, on, a, wire, like, other, inductors, chokes, resist, changes, in, current, passing, through, them, increasingly, with, frequency, the, difference, between, chokes, and, other, inductors, is, that, chokes, do, not, require, the, high, q, factor, construction, techniques, that, are, used, to, reduce, the, resistance, in, inductors, used, in, tuned, circuits, the, effect, of, an, inductor, in, a, circuit, is, to, oppose, changes, in, current, through, it, by, developing, a, voltage, across, it, proportional, to, the, rate, of, change, of, the, current, an, ideal, inductor, would, offer, no, resistance, to, a, constant, direct, current, however, only, superconducting, inductors, have, truly, zero, electrical, resistance, the, relationship, between, the, time, varying, voltage, v, t, across, an, inductor, with, inductance, l, and, the, time, varying, current, i, t, passing, through, it, is, described, by, the, differential, equation, when, there, is, a, sinusoidal, alternating, current, ac, through, an, inductor, a, sinusoidal, voltage, is, induced, the, amplitude, of, the, voltage, is, proportional, to, the, product, of, the, amplitude, i, p, displaystyle, i, p, of, the, current, and, the, angular, frequency, displaystyle, omega, of, the, current, in, this, situation, the, phase, of, the, current, lags, that, of, the, voltage, by, 2, 90, for, sinusoids, as, the, voltage, across, the, inductor, goes, to, its, maximum, value, the, current, goes, to, zero, and, as, the, voltage, across, the, inductor, goes, to, zero, the, current, through, it, goes, to, its, maximum, value, if, an, inductor, is, connected, to, a, direct, current, source, with, value, i, via, a, resistance, r, at, least, the, dcr, of, the, inductor, and, then, the, current, source, is, short, circuited, the, differential, relationship, above, shows, that, the, current, through, the, inductor, will, discharge, with, an, exponential, decay, the, ratio, of, the, peak, voltage, to, the, peak, current, in, an, inductor, energised, from, an, ac, source, is, called, the, reactance, and, is, denoted, x, l, thus, where, is, the, angular, frequency, reactance, is, measured, in, ohms, but, referred, to, as, impedance, rather, than, resistance, energy, is, stored, in, the, magnetic, field, as, current, rises, and, discharged, as, current, falls, inductive, reactance, is, proportional, to, frequency, at, low, frequency, the, reactance, falls, at, dc, the, inductor, behaves, as, a, short, circuit, as, frequency, increases, the, reactance, increases, and, at, a, sufficiently, high, frequency, the, reactance, approaches, that, of, an, open, circuit, in, filtering, applications, with, respect, to, a, particular, load, impedance, an, inductor, has, a, corner, frequency, defined, as, when, using, the, laplace, transform, in, circuit, analysis, the, impedance, of, an, ideal, inductor, with, no, initial, current, is, represented, in, the, s, domain, by, where, if, the, inductor, does, have, initial, current, it, can, be, represented, by, where, inductors, in, a, parallel, configuration, each, have, the, same, potential, difference, voltage, to, find, their, total, equivalent, inductance, l, eq, the, current, through, inductors, in, series, stays, the, same, but, the, voltage, across, each, inductor, can, be, different, the, sum, of, the, potential, differences, voltage, is, equal, to, the, total, voltage, to, find, their, total, inductance, these, simple, relationships, hold, true, only, when, there, is, no, mutual, coupling, of, magnetic, fields, between, individual, inductors, mutual, inductance, occurs, when, the, magnetic, field, of, an, inductor, induces, a, magnetic, field, in, an, adjacent, inductor, mutual, induction, is, the, basis, of, transformer, construction, where, m, is, the, maximum, mutual, inductance, possible, between, 2, inductors, and, l, 1, and, l, 2, are, the, two, inductors, in, general, as, only, a, fraction, of, self, flux, is, linked, with, the, other, this, fraction, is, called, coefficient, of, flux, linkage, k, or, coefficient, of, coupling, the, table, below, lists, some, common, simplified, formulas, for, calculating, the, approximate, inductance, of, several, inductor, constructions, where, the, term, b, subtracts, rather, than, adds, l, 0, 2, ln, 4, d, 3, 4, displaystyle, l, frac, mu, 0, 2, pi,
