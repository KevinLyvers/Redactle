a, chainsaw, or, chain, saw, is, a, portable, handheld, power, saw, that, cuts, with, a, set, of, teeth, attached, to, a, rotating, chain, driven, along, a, guide, bar, modern, chainsaws, are, typically, gasoline, or, electric, and, are, used, in, activities, such, as, tree, felling, limbing, bucking, pruning, cutting, firebreaks, in, wildland, fire, suppression, harvesting, of, firewood, for, use, in, chainsaw, art, and, chainsaw, mills, for, cutting, concrete, and, cutting, ice, precursors, to, modern, chainsaws, were, first, used, in, surgery, with, patents, for, wood, chainsaws, beginning, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, chainsaw, comprises, an, engine, a, drive, mechanism, a, guide, bar, a, cutting, chain, a, tensioning, mechanism, and, safety, features, various, safety, practices, and, working, techniques, are, used, with, chainsaws, the, origin, of, chainsaws, in, surgery, is, debated, a, flexible, saw, consisting, of, a, fine, serrated, link, chain, held, between, two, wooden, handles, was, pioneered, in, the, late, 18th, century, c, 1783, 1785, by, two, scottish, doctors, john, aitken, and, james, jeffray, for, symphysiotomy, and, excision, of, diseased, bone, respectively, it, was, illustrated, in, the, second, edition, of, aitken, s, principles, of, midwifery, or, puerperal, medicine, 1785, in, the, context, of, a, pelviotomy, in, 1806, jeffray, published, cases, of, the, excision, of, carious, joints, which, collected, a, paper, previously, published, by, h, park, in, 1782, and, a, translation, of, an, 1803, paper, by, french, physician, p, f, moreau, with, additional, observations, by, park, and, jeffray, in, it, jeffray, reported, having, conceived, the, idea, of, a, saw, with, joints, like, the, chain, of, a, watch, independently, very, soon, after, park, s, original, 1782, publication, but, that, he, was, not, able, to, have, it, produced, until, 1790, after, which, it, was, used, in, the, anatomy, lab, and, occasionally, lent, out, to, surgeons, park, and, moreau, described, successful, excision, of, diseased, joints, particularly, the, knee, and, elbow, and, jeffray, explained, that, the, chainsaw, would, allow, a, smaller, wound, and, protect, the, adjacent, muscles, nerves, and, veins, while, symphysiotomy, had, too, many, complications, for, most, obstetricians, jeffray, s, ideas, about, the, excision, of, the, ends, of, bones, became, more, accepted, especially, after, the, widespread, adoption, of, anaesthetics, for, much, of, the, 19th, century, the, chainsaw, was, a, useful, surgical, instrument, but, it, was, superseded, in, 1894, by, the, gigli, twisted, wire, saw, which, was, substantially, cheaper, to, manufacture, and, gave, a, quicker, narrower, cut, without, risk, of, breaking, and, being, entrapped, in, the, bone, a, precursor, of, the, chainsaw, familiar, today, in, the, timber, industry, was, another, medical, instrument, developed, around, 1830, by, german, precision, mechanic, and, orthopaedist, bernhard, heine, this, instrument, the, osteotome, had, links, of, a, chain, carrying, small, cutting, teeth, with, the, edges, set, at, an, angle, the, chain, was, moved, around, a, guiding, blade, by, turning, the, handle, of, a, sprocket, wheel, as, the, name, implies, this, was, used, to, cut, bone, one, of, the, earliest, patents, for, an, endless, chain, saw, comprising, a, chain, of, links, carrying, saw, teeth, was, granted, to, frederick, l, magaw, of, flatlands, new, york, in, 1883, apparently, for, the, purpose, of, producing, boards, by, stretching, the, chain, between, grooved, drums, a, later, patent, incorporating, a, guide, frame, was, granted, to, samuel, j, bens, of, san, francisco, on, january, 17, 1905, his, intent, being, to, fell, giant, redwoods, the, first, portable, chainsaw, was, developed, and, patented, in, 1918, by, canadian, millwright, james, shand, after, he, allowed, his, rights, to, lapse, in, 1930, his, invention, was, further, developed, by, what, became, the, german, company, festo, in, 1933, the, company, now, operating, as, festool, produces, portable, power, tools, other, important, contributors, to, the, modern, chainsaw, are, joseph, buford, cox, and, andreas, stihl, the, latter, patented, and, developed, an, electric, chainsaw, for, use, on, bucking, sites, in, 1926, and, a, gasoline, powered, chainsaw, in, 1929, and, founded, a, company, to, mass, produce, them, in, 1927, emil, lerp, the, founder, of, dolmar, developed, the, world, s, first, gasoline, powered, chainsaw, and, mass, produced, them, world, war, ii, interrupted, the, supply, of, german, chainsaws, to, north, america, so, new, manufacturers, sprang, up, including, industrial, engineering, ltd, iel, in, 1939, the, forerunner, of, pioneer, saws, ltd, and, part, of, outboard, marine, corporation, the, oldest, manufacturer, of, chainsaws, in, north, america, in, 1944, claude, poulan, was, supervising, german, prisoners, cutting, pulpwood, in, east, texas, poulan, utilized, an, old, truck, fender, and, fashioned, it, into, a, curved, piece, utilized, to, guide, the, chain, the, bow, guide, now, allowed, the, chainsaw, to, be, utilized, by, a, single, operator, mcculloch, in, north, america, started, to, produce, chainsaws, in, 1948, the, early, models, were, heavy, two, person, devices, with, long, bars, often, chainsaws, were, so, heavy, that, they, had, wheels, like, dragsaws, other, outfits, used, driven, lines, from, a, wheeled, power, unit, to, drive, the, cutting, bar, after, world, war, ii, improvements, in, aluminum, and, engine, design, lightened, chainsaws, to, the, point, where, one, person, could, carry, them, in, some, areas, the, chainsaw, and, skidder, crews, have, been, replaced, by, the, feller, buncher, and, harvester, chainsaws, have, almost, entirely, replaced, simple, man, powered, saws, in, forestry, they, are, made, in, many, sizes, from, small, electric, saws, intended, for, home, and, garden, use, to, large, lumberjack, saws, members, of, military, engineer, units, are, trained, to, use, chainsaws, as, are, firefighters, to, fight, forest, fires, and, to, ventilate, structure, fires, three, main, types, of, chainsaw, sharpeners, are, used, handheld, file, electric, chainsaw, and, bar, mounted, the, first, electric, chainsaw, was, invented, by, stihl, in, 1926, corded, chainsaws, became, available, for, sale, to, the, public, from, the, 1960s, onwards, but, these, were, never, as, successful, commercially, as, the, older, gas, powered, type, due, to, limited, range, dependency, upon, the, presence, of, an, electrical, socket, plus, the, health, and, safety, risk, of, the, blade, s, proximity, to, the, cable, for, most, of, the, early, 21st, century, petrol, driven, chainsaws, remained, the, most, common, type, but, they, faced, competition, from, cordless, lithium, battery, powered, chainsaws, from, the, late, 2010s, onwards, although, most, cordless, chainsaws, are, small, and, suitable, only, for, hedge, trimming, and, tree, surgery, husqvarna, and, stihl, began, manufacturing, full, size, chainsaws, for, cutting, logs, during, the, early, 2020s, battery, powered, chainsaws, should, eventually, see, increased, market, share, in, california, due, to, state, restrictions, planned, to, take, effect, in, 2024, on, gas, powered, gardening, equipment, a, chainsaw, consists, of, several, parts, chainsaw, engines, are, traditionally, either, a, two, stroke, gasoline, petrol, internal, combustion, engine, usually, with, a, cylinder, volume, of, 30, to, 120, cm, 3, or, an, electric, motor, driven, by, a, battery, or, electric, power, cord, in, a, petrol, chainsaw, fuel, is, generally, supplied, to, the, engine, by, a, carburetor, at, the, intake, two, stroke, engines, have, been, preferred, for, chainsaws, due, to, their, higher, power, to, weight, ratio, and, simplicity, hydraulic, power, may, be, used, for, chainsaws, for, underwater, use, to, allow, use, in, any, orientation, modern, gas, chainsaws, use, a, diaphragm, carburetor, which, draws, fuel, from, the, tank, using, the, alternating, pressure, differential, within, the, crankcase, early, engines, used, carburetors, with, gravity, fed, float, chambers, which, caused, the, engine, to, stall, when, tilted, the, carburetor, may, need, to, be, adjusted, to, maintain, an, appropriate, idle, speed, and, air, fuel, ratio, such, as, when, moving, to, a, higher, lower, altitude, or, as, the, air, filter, clogs, carburetors, are, adjusted, either, by, the, operator, or, in, some, saws, automatically, by, an, electronic, control, unit, to, prevent, vibration, induced, injury, and, reduce, user, fatigue, saws, generally, have, an, anti, vibration, system, to, physically, decouple, the, handles, from, the, engine, and, bar, this, is, achieved, by, constructing, the, saw, in, two, pieces, connected, by, springs, or, rubber, in, the, same, way, an, automobile, suspension, isolates, the, chassis, from, the, wheels, and, road, in, cold, weather, carburetor, icing, can, occur, so, many, saws, have, a, vent, between, the, cylinders, and, carburetor, which, may, be, opened, to, allow, hot, air, to, pass, cold, temperature, can, also, contribute, to, vibration, induced, injury, and, some, saws, have, a, small, alternator, connected, to, resistive, heating, elements, in, the, handles, and, or, carburetor, typically, a, centrifugal, clutch, and, sprocket, are, used, the, centrifugal, clutch, expands, with, increasing, speed, engaging, a, drum, on, this, drum, sits, either, a, fixed, sprocket, or, an, exchangeable, one, the, clutch, has, three, jobs, when, the, engine, runs, idle, typically, 2500, 2700, rpm, the, chain, does, not, move, when, the, clutch, is, engaged, and, the, chain, stops, in, the, wood, for, another, reason, it, protects, the, engine, most, importantly, it, protects, the, operator, in, case, of, a, kickback, here, the, chain, brake, stops, the, drum, and, the, clutch, releases, immediately, a, guide, bar, typically, an, elongated, bar, with, a, round, end, of, wear, resistant, alloy, steel, typically, 40, to, 90, cm, 16, to, 36, in, in, length, is, used, an, edge, slot, guides, the, cutting, chain, specialized, loop, style, bars, called, bow, bars, were, also, used, at, one, time, for, bucking, logs, and, clearing, brush, although, they, are, now, rarely, encountered, due, to, increased, hazards, of, operation, all, guide, bars, have, some, elements, for, operation, the, lower, part, of, the, chain, runs, in, the, gauge, here, the, lubrication, oil, is, pulled, by, the, chain, to, the, nose, this, is, basically, the, thickness, of, the, drive, links, the, end, of, the, saw, power, head, has, two, oil, holes, one, on, each, side, these, holes, must, match, with, the, outlet, of, the, oil, pump, the, pump, sends, the, oil, through, the, hole, in, the, lower, part, of, the, gauge, saw, bar, producers, provide, a, large, variety, of, bars, matching, different, saws, through, this, hole, grease, is, pumped, typically, each, tank, filling, to, keep, the, nose, sprocket, well, lubricated, here, one, or, two, bolts, from, the, saw, run, through, the, clutch, cover, is, put, on, top, of, the, bar, and, it, is, secured, through, these, bolts, the, number, of, bolts, is, determined, by, the, size, of, the, saw, different, bar, types, are, available, usually, each, segment, in, a, chain, which, is, constructed, from, riveted, metal, sections, similar, to, a, bicycle, chain, but, without, rollers, features, small, sharp, cutting, teeth, each, tooth, takes, the, form, of, a, folded, tab, of, chromium, plated, steel, with, a, sharp, angular, or, curved, corner, and, two, beveled, cutting, edges, one, on, the, top, plate, and, one, on, the, side, plate, left, handed, and, right, handed, teeth, are, alternated, in, the, chain, chains, are, made, in, varying, pitch, and, gauge, the, pitch, of, a, chain, is, defined, as, half, of, the, length, spanned, by, any, three, consecutive, rivets, e, g, 8, mm, 0, 325, inch, while, the, gauge, is, the, thickness, of, the, drive, link, where, it, fits, into, the, guide, bar, e, g, 1, 5, mm, 0, 05, inch, the, conventional, full, complement, chain, has, one, tooth, for, every, two, drive, links, full, skip, chain, has, one, tooth, for, every, three, drive, links, built, into, each, tooth, is, a, depth, gauge, or, raker, which, rides, ahead, of, the, tooth, and, limits, the, depth, of, cut, typically, to, around, 0, 5, mm, 0, 025, depth, gauges, are, critical, to, safe, chain, operation, if, left, too, high, they, cause, very, slow, cutting, if, filed, too, low, the, chain, becomes, more, prone, to, kick, back, low, depth, gauges, also, cause, the, saw, to, vibrate, excessively, vibration, is, uncomfortable, for, the, operator, and, is, detrimental, to, the, saw, the, tension, of, the, cutting, chain, is, adjusted, so, that, it, neither, binds, on, nor, comes, loose, from, the, guide, bar, the, tensioner, for, doing, so, is, either, operated, by, turning, a, screw, or, a, manual, wheel, the, tensioner, is, either, in, a, lateral, position, underneath, the, exhaust, or, integrated, into, the, clutch, cover, lateral, tensioners, have, the, advantage, that, the, clutch, cover, is, easier, to, mount, but, the, disadvantage, that, it, is, more, difficult, to, reach, nearby, the, bar, tensioners, through, the, clutch, cover, are, easier, to, operate, but, the, clutch, cover, is, more, difficult, to, attach, when, turning, the, screw, a, hook, in, a, bar, hole, moves, the, bar, either, out, tensioning, or, in, making, the, chain, loose, tension, is, right, when, it, can, be, moved, easily, by, hand, and, not, hanging, loose, from, the, bar, when, tensioning, hold, the, bar, nose, up, and, pull, the, bar, nuts, tight, otherwise, the, chain, might, derail, the, underside, of, each, link, features, a, small, metal, finger, called, a, drive, link, which, locates, the, chain, on, the, bar, helps, to, carry, lubricating, oil, around, the, bar, and, engages, with, the, engine, s, drive, sprocket, inside, the, body, of, the, saw, the, engine, drives, the, chain, around, the, track, by, a, centrifugal, clutch, engaging, the, chain, as, engine, speed, increases, under, power, but, allowing, it, to, stop, as, the, engine, speed, slows, to, idle, speed, consistent, improvement, to, overall, chainsaw, design, including, adding, safety, features, has, taken, place, over, the, years, these, include, chain, brake, systems, better, chain, design, and, lighter, more, ergonomic, saws, including, fatigue, reducing, antivibration, systems, as, chainsaw, carving, has, become, more, popular, manufacturers, are, making, special, short, narrow, tipped, bars, called, quarter, tipped, nickel, tipped, or, dime, tipped, bars, based, on, the, size, of, their, tips, some, chainsaws, are, built, specifically, for, carving, applications, echo, sponsors, a, carving, series, today, s, chainsaws, have, multiple, safety, features, to, protect, the, operator, these, include, two, stroke, chainsaws, require, about, 2, 5, of, oil, in, the, fuel, to, lubricate, the, engine, while, the, motor, in, electrical, chain, saws, is, normally, lubricated, for, life, most, modern, gasoline, operated, saws, today, require, a, fuel, mix, of, 2, 1, 50, gasoline, that, contains, ethanol, can, result, in, problems, for, the, equipment, because, ethanol, dissolves, plastic, rubber, and, other, material, this, leads, to, problems, especially, on, older, equipment, a, workaround, for, this, problem, is, to, run, fresh, fuel, only, and, run, the, saw, dry, at, the, end, of, the, work, separate, chain, oil, or, bar, oil, is, used, for, the, lubrication, of, the, bar, and, chain, on, all, types, of, chainsaws, the, chain, oil, is, depleted, quickly, because, it, tends, to, be, thrown, off, by, chain, centrifugal, force, and, it, is, soaked, up, by, sawdust, on, two, stroke, chainsaws, the, chain, oil, reservoir, is, usually, filled, up, at, the, same, time, as, refueling, the, reservoir, is, normally, large, enough, to, provide, sufficient, chain, oil, between, refueling, lack, of, chain, oil, or, using, an, oil, of, incorrect, viscosity, is, a, common, source, of, damage, to, chainsaws, and, tends, to, lead, to, rapid, wear, of, the, bar, or, the, chain, seizing, or, coming, off, the, bar, in, addition, to, being, quite, thick, chain, oil, is, particularly, sticky, due, to, tackifier, additives, to, reduce, the, amount, thrown, off, the, chain, although, motor, oil, is, a, common, emergency, substitute, it, is, lost, even, faster, so, leaves, the, chain, under, lubricated, the, oil, is, pumped, from, a, small, pump, to, a, hole, in, the, bar, from, there, the, lower, ends, of, each, chain, drive, link, take, a, portion, of, the, oil, into, the, gauge, towards, the, bar, nose, the, pump, outlet, and, bar, hole, must, be, aligned, since, the, bar, is, moving, out, and, inwards, depending, on, the, chain, length, the, oil, outlet, on, the, saw, side, has, a, banana, style, long, shape, chains, must, be, kept, sharp, to, perform, well, they, become, blunt, rapidly, if, they, touch, soil, metal, or, stones, when, blunt, they, tend, to, produce, powdery, sawdust, rather, than, the, longer, clean, shavings, characteristic, of, a, sharp, chain, a, sharp, saw, also, needs, very, little, force, from, the, operator, to, push, it, into, the, cut, specially, hardened, chains, made, with, tungsten, carbide, are, used, for, applications, where, the, soil, is, likely, to, contaminate, the, cut, such, as, for, cutting, through, roots, a, clear, sign, of, a, blunt, chain, is, the, vibrations, of, the, saw, a, sharp, chain, pulls, itself, into, the, wood, without, pressing, on, the, saw, since, the, air, intake, filter, tends, to, clog, up, with, sawdust, it, must, be, cleaned, from, time, to, time, but, is, not, a, problem, during, normal, operation, protective, clothing, is, designed, to, protect, operators, in, the, event, of, a, moving, chain, touching, their, clothing, by, snarling, the, chain, and, sprocket, by, using, special, synthetic, fibers, woven, into, the, garment, despite, safety, features, and, protective, clothing, injuries, can, still, arise, from, chainsaw, use, from, the, large, forces, involved, in, the, work, from, the, fast, moving, sharp, chain, or, the, vibration, and, noise, of, the, machinery, a, common, accident, arises, from, kickback, when, a, chain, tooth, at, the, tip, of, the, guide, bar, catches, on, wood, without, cutting, through, it, this, throws, the, bar, with, its, moving, chain, in, an, upward, arc, toward, the, operator, which, can, cause, serious, injury, or, even, death, another, dangerous, situation, occurs, when, heavy, timber, begins, to, fall, or, shift, before, a, cut, is, complete, the, chainsaw, operator, may, be, trapped, or, crushed, similarly, timber, falling, in, an, unplanned, direction, may, harm, the, operator, or, other, workers, or, an, operator, working, at, a, height, may, fall, or, be, injured, by, falling, timber, like, other, hand, held, machinery, the, operation, of, chainsaws, can, cause, vibration, white, finger, tinnitus, or, industrial, deafness, these, symptoms, were, very, common, before, vibration, dampening, using, rubber, or, steel, spring, was, introduced, heated, handles, are, additional, help, newer, lighter, and, easier, to, wield, cordless, electric, chainsaws, use, brushless, motors, which, further, decrease, noise, and, vibration, compared, to, traditional, petroleum, powered, models, the, risks, associated, with, chainsaw, use, mean, that, protective, clothing, such, as, chainsaw, boots, chaps, and, hearing, protectors, are, normally, worn, while, operating, them, and, many, jurisdictions, require, that, operators, be, certified, or, licensed, to, work, with, chainsaws, injury, can, also, result, if, the, chain, breaks, during, operation, due, to, poor, maintenance, or, attempting, to, cut, inappropriate, materials, gasoline, powered, chainsaws, expose, operators, to, harmful, carbon, monoxide, gas, especially, indoors, or, in, partially, enclosed, outdoor, areas, drop, starting, or, turning, on, a, chainsaw, by, dropping, it, with, one, hand, while, pulling, the, starting, cord, with, the, other, is, a, safety, violation, in, most, states, in, the, u, s, keeping, both, hands, on, the, saw, for, stability, is, essential, for, safe, chainsaw, use, safe, and, effective, chainsaw, and, crosscut, use, on, federally, administered, public, lands, within, the, united, states, has, been, codified, since, 2016, in, the, final, directive, for, national, saw, program, issued, by, the, united, states, forest, service, which, specifies, the, training, testing, and, certification, process, for, employees, and, unpaid, volunteers, who, operate, chainsaws, within, public, lands, chainsaw, training, is, designed, to, provide, working, technical, knowledge, and, skills, to, safely, operate, the, equipment, chainsaws, with, specially, designed, bar, and, chain, combinations, have, been, developed, as, tools, for, use, in, chainsaw, art, and, chainsaw, mills, specialized, chainsaws, are, used, for, cutting, concrete, during, construction, developments, chainsaws, are, sometimes, used, for, cutting, ice, for, example, ice, sculpture, and, winter, swimming, in, finland, when, fastened, into, a, special, guide, frame, a, chainsaw, can, be, used, as, a, portable, sawmill, to, cut, bulk, wood, into, planks, or, boards, such, usage, is, called, a, chainsaw, mill, or, alaskan, sawmill, special, chainsaws, can, cut, concrete, brick, and, natural, stone, these, use, similar, chains, to, ordinary, chainsaws, but, with, cutting, edges, embedded, with, diamond, grit, they, may, use, gasoline, or, hydraulic, power, and, the, chain, is, lubricated, with, water, because, of, high, friction, and, to, remove, stone, dust, the, machine, is, used, in, construction, for, example, in, cutting, deep, square, holes, in, walls, or, floors, in, stone, sculpture, for, removing, large, chunks, of, stone, during, pre, carving, by, fire, departments, for, gaining, access, to, buildings, and, in, restoration, of, buildings, and, monuments, for, removing, parts, with, minimal, damage, to, the, surrounding, structure, more, recently, concrete, chainsaws, with, electric, motors, of, 230, volts, have, also, been, developed, because, the, material, to, be, cut, is, not, fibrous, much, less, kickback, occurs, so, the, most, used, method, of, cutting, is, plunge, cutting, by, pushing, the, tip, of, the, blade, into, the, material, with, this, method, square, cuts, as, small, as, the, blade, width, can, be, achieved, pushback, can, occur, if, a, block, shifts, when, nearly, cut, through, and, pinches, the, blade, but, overall, the, machine, is, less, dangerous, than, a, wood, cutting, chainsaw, chainsaws, are, used, for, underwater, cutting, by, professional, divers, they, are, usually, driven, by, hydraulic, power, supplied, from, the, surface, and, operated, by, commercial, divers, using, surface, supplied, diving, equipment, underwater, chainsaw, cutting, may, also, be, used, by, public, safety, divers, hydraulic, chainsaws, can, be, used, to, cut, wood, concrete, brick, and, steel, if, the, appropriate, chain, is, used, underwater, cutting, may, be, done, in, conditions, of, moving, water, and, low, visibility, which, can, increase, risk, and, appropriate, safety, precautions, and, suitable, procedures, are, required, for, safety, underwater, wood, structures, may, include, bridge, pilings, pier, and, dock, timbers, chain, saws, generally, include, an, interlocking, safety, trigger, with, hand, guard
