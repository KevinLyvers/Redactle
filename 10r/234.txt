an, abrasive, is, a, material, often, a, mineral, that, is, used, to, shape, or, finish, a, workpiece, through, rubbing, which, leads, to, part, of, the, workpiece, being, worn, away, by, friction, while, finishing, a, material, often, means, polishing, it, to, gain, a, smooth, reflective, surface, the, process, can, also, involve, roughening, as, in, satin, matte, or, beaded, finishes, in, short, the, ceramics, which, are, used, to, cut, grind, and, polish, other, softer, materials, are, known, as, abrasives, abrasives, are, extremely, commonplace, and, are, used, very, extensively, in, a, wide, variety, of, industrial, domestic, and, technological, applications, this, gives, rise, to, a, large, variation, in, the, physical, and, chemical, composition, of, abrasives, as, well, as, the, shape, of, the, abrasive, some, common, uses, for, abrasives, include, grinding, polishing, buffing, honing, cutting, drilling, sharpening, lapping, and, sanding, see, abrasive, machining, for, simplicity, mineral, in, this, article, will, be, used, loosely, to, refer, to, both, minerals, and, mineral, like, substances, whether, man, made, or, not, files, are, not, abrasives, they, remove, material, not, by, scratching, or, rubbing, but, by, the, cutting, action, of, sharp, teeth, which, have, been, cut, into, the, surface, of, the, file, very, much, like, those, of, a, saw, however, diamond, files, are, a, form, of, coated, abrasive, as, they, are, metal, rods, coated, with, diamond, powder, abrasives, generally, rely, upon, a, difference, in, hardness, between, the, abrasive, and, the, material, being, worked, upon, the, abrasive, being, the, harder, of, the, two, substances, however, it, is, not, strictly, necessary, as, any, two, solid, materials, that, repeatedly, rub, against, each, other, will, tend, to, wear, each, other, away, examples, include, softer, shoe, soles, wearing, away, wooden, or, stone, steps, over, decades, or, centuries, or, glaciers, abrading, stone, valleys, typically, materials, used, as, abrasives, are, either, hard, minerals, rated, at, 7, or, above, on, mohs, scale, of, mineral, hardness, or, are, synthetic, stones, some, of, which, may, be, chemically, and, physically, identical, to, naturally, occurring, minerals, but, which, cannot, be, called, minerals, as, they, did, not, arise, naturally, while, useful, for, comparative, purposes, the, mohs, scale, is, of, limited, value, to, materials, engineers, as, it, is, an, arbitrary, ordinal, irregular, scale, diamond, a, common, abrasive, for, instance, occurs, both, naturally, and, is, industrially, produced, as, is, corundum, which, occurs, naturally, but, which, is, nowadays, more, commonly, manufactured, from, bauxite, however, even, softer, minerals, like, calcium, carbonate, are, used, as, abrasives, such, as, polishing, agents, in, toothpaste, these, minerals, are, either, crushed, or, are, already, of, a, sufficiently, small, size, anywhere, from, macroscopic, grains, as, large, as, about, 2, mm, to, microscopic, grains, about, 0, 001, mm, in, diameter, to, permit, their, use, as, an, abrasive, these, grains, commonly, called, grit, have, rough, edges, often, terminating, in, points, which, will, decrease, the, surface, area, in, contact, and, increase, the, localised, contact, pressure, the, abrasive, and, the, material, to, be, worked, are, brought, into, contact, while, in, relative, motion, to, each, other, force, applied, through, the, grains, causes, fragments, of, the, worked, material, to, break, away, while, simultaneously, smoothing, the, abrasive, grain, and, or, causing, the, grain, to, work, loose, from, the, rest, of, the, abrasive, some, factors, which, will, affect, how, quickly, a, substance, is, abraded, include, abrasives, may, be, classified, as, either, natural, or, synthetic, when, discussing, sharpening, stones, natural, stones, have, long, been, considered, superior, but, advances, in, material, technology, are, seeing, this, distinction, become, less, distinct, many, synthetic, abrasives, are, effectively, identical, to, a, natural, mineral, differing, only, in, that, the, synthetic, mineral, has, been, manufactured, rather, than, mined, impurities, in, the, natural, mineral, may, make, it, less, effective, some, naturally, occurring, abrasives, are, some, abrasive, minerals, such, as, zirconia, alumina, occur, naturally, but, are, sufficiently, rare, or, sufficiently, more, difficult, or, costly, to, obtain, such, that, a, synthetic, stone, is, used, industrially, these, and, other, artificial, abrasives, include, abrasives, are, shaped, for, various, purposes, natural, abrasives, are, often, sold, as, dressed, stones, usually, in, the, form, of, a, rectangular, block, both, natural, and, synthetic, abrasives, are, commonly, available, in, a, wide, variety, of, shapes, often, coming, as, bonded, or, coated, abrasives, including, blocks, belts, discs, wheels, sheets, rods, and, loose, grains, a, bonded, abrasive, is, composed, of, an, abrasive, material, contained, within, a, matrix, although, very, fine, aluminium, oxide, abrasive, may, comprise, sintered, material, this, matrix, is, called, a, binder, and, is, often, a, clay, a, resin, a, glass, or, a, rubber, this, mixture, of, binder, and, abrasive, is, typically, shaped, into, blocks, sticks, or, wheels, the, most, common, abrasive, used, is, aluminium, oxide, also, common, are, silicon, carbide, tungsten, carbide, and, garnet, artificial, sharpening, stones, are, often, a, bonded, abrasive, and, are, readily, available, as, a, two, sided, block, each, side, being, a, different, grade, of, grit, grinding, wheels, are, cylinders, that, are, rotated, at, high, speed, while, once, worked, with, a, foot, pedal, or, hand, crank, the, introduction, of, electric, motors, has, made, it, necessary, to, construct, the, wheel, to, withstand, greater, radial, stress, to, prevent, the, wheel, flying, apart, as, it, spins, similar, issues, arise, with, cutting, wheels, which, are, often, structurally, reinforced, with, impregnated, fibres, high, relative, speed, between, abrasive, and, workpiece, often, makes, necessary, the, use, of, a, lubricant, of, some, kind, traditionally, they, were, called, coolants, as, they, were, used, to, prevent, frictional, heat, build, up, which, could, damage, the, workpiece, such, as, ruining, the, temper, of, a, blade, some, research, suggests, that, the, heat, transport, property, of, a, lubricant, is, less, important, when, dealing, with, metals, as, the, metal, will, quickly, conduct, heat, from, the, work, surface, more, important, are, their, effects, upon, lessening, tensile, stresses, while, increasing, some, compressive, stresses, and, reducing, thermal, and, mechanical, stresses, during, chip, formation, various, shapes, are, also, used, as, heads, on, rotary, tools, used, in, precision, work, such, as, scale, modelling, bonded, abrasives, need, to, be, trued, and, dressed, after, they, are, used, dressing, is, the, cleaning, of, the, waste, material, swarf, and, loose, abrasive, from, the, surface, and, exposing, fresh, grit, depending, upon, the, abrasive, and, how, it, was, used, dressing, may, involve, the, abrasive, being, simply, placed, under, running, water, and, brushed, with, a, stiff, brush, for, a, soft, stone, or, the, abrasive, being, ground, against, another, abrasive, such, as, aluminium, oxide, used, to, dress, a, grinding, wheel, truing, is, restoring, the, abrasive, to, its, original, surface, shape, wheels, and, stones, tend, to, wear, unevenly, leaving, the, cutting, surface, no, longer, flat, said, to, be, dished, out, if, it, is, meant, to, be, a, flat, stone, or, no, longer, the, same, diameter, across, the, cutting, face, this, will, lead, to, uneven, abrasion, and, other, difficulties, a, coated, abrasive, comprises, an, abrasive, fixed, to, a, backing, material, such, as, paper, cloth, rubber, resin, polyester, or, even, metal, many, of, which, are, flexible, sandpaper, is, a, very, common, coated, abrasive, coated, abrasives, are, most, commonly, the, same, minerals, as, are, used, for, bonded, abrasives, a, bonding, agent, often, some, sort, of, adhesive, or, resin, is, applied, to, the, backing, to, provide, a, flat, surface, to, which, the, grit, is, then, subsequently, adhered, a, woven, backing, may, also, use, a, filler, agent, again, often, a, resin, to, provide, additional, resilience, coated, abrasives, may, be, shaped, for, use, in, rotary, and, orbital, sanders, for, wrapping, around, sanding, blocks, as, handpads, as, closed, loops, for, use, on, belt, grinders, as, striking, surfaces, on, matchboxes, on, diamond, plates, and, diamond, steels, diamond, tools, though, for, cutting, are, often, abrasive, in, nature, sand, glass, beads, metal, pellets, copper, slag, and, dry, ice, may, all, be, used, for, a, process, called, sandblasting, or, similar, such, as, the, use, of, glass, beads, which, is, bead, blasting, dry, ice, will, sublimate, leaving, behind, no, residual, abrasive, cutting, compound, used, on, automotive, paint, is, an, example, of, an, abrasive, suspended, in, a, liquid, paste, or, wax, as, are, some, polishing, liquids, for, silverware, and, optical, media, the, liquid, paste, or, wax, acts, as, a, binding, agent, that, keeps, the, abrasive, attached, to, the, cloth, which, is, used, as, a, backing, to, move, the, abrasive, across, the, work, piece, on, cars, in, particular, wax, may, serve, as, both, a, protective, agent, by, preventing, exposure, of, the, paint, of, metal, to, air, and, also, act, as, an, optical, filler, to, make, scratches, less, noticeable, toothpaste, contains, calcium, carbonate, or, silica, as, a, polishing, agent, to, remove, plaque, and, other, matter, from, teeth, as, the, hardness, of, calcium, carbonate, is, less, than, that, of, tooth, enamel, but, more, than, that, of, the, contaminating, agent, very, fine, rouge, powder, was, commonly, used, for, grinding, glass, being, somewhat, replaced, by, modern, ceramics, and, is, still, used, in, jewellery, making, for, a, highly, reflective, finish, cleaning, products, may, also, contain, abrasives, suspended, in, a, paste, or, cream, they, are, chosen, to, be, reasonably, safe, on, some, linoleum, tile, metal, or, stone, surfaces, however, many, laminate, surfaces, and, ceramic, topped, stoves, are, easily, damaged, by, these, abrasive, compounds, even, ceramic, pottery, tableware, or, cookware, can, damage, these, surfaces, particularly, the, bottom, of, the, tableware, which, is, often, unglazed, in, part, or, in, whole, and, acts, as, simply, another, bonded, abrasive, metal, pots, and, stoves, are, often, scoured, with, abrasive, cleaners, typically, in, the, form, of, the, aforementioned, cream, or, paste, or, of, steel, wool, and, non, woven, scouring, pads, which, holds, fine, grits, abrasives, human, skin, is, also, subjected, to, abrasion, in, the, form, of, exfoliation, abrasives, for, this, can, be, much, softer, and, more, exotic, than, for, other, purposes, and, may, include, things, like, almond, and, oatmeal, dermabrasion, and, microdermabrasion, are, now, rather, commonplace, cosmetic, procedures, which, use, mineral, abrasives, scratched, compact, discs, and, dvds, may, sometimes, be, repaired, through, buffing, with, a, very, fine, compound, the, principle, being, that, a, multitude, of, small, scratches, will, be, more, optically, transparent, than, a, single, large, scratch, however, this, does, take, some, skill, and, will, eventually, cause, the, protective, coating, of, the, disc, to, be, entirely, eroded, especially, if, the, original, scratch, is, deep, at, which, time, the, data, surface, will, be, destroyed, if, abrasion, continues, silicon, carbide, powders, are, commonly, used, as, abrasive, materials, in, various, machining, processes, including, grinding, water, jet, cutting, and, sandblasting, these, powders, are, effective, for, fine, grinding, or, rough, polishing, of, semiconductors, ceramics, and, ferrous, materials, the, shape, size, and, nature, of, the, workpiece, and, the, desired, finish, will, influence, the, choice, of, the, abrasive, used, a, bonded, abrasive, grind, wheel, may, be, used, to, commercially, sharpen, a, knife, producing, a, hollow, grind, but, an, individual, may, then, sharpen, the, same, knife, with, a, natural, sharpening, stone, or, an, even, flexible, coated, abrasive, like, a, sandpaper, stuck, to, a, soft, non, slip, surface, to, make, achieving, a, convex, grind, easier, similarly, a, brass, mirror, may, be, cut, with, a, bonded, abrasive, have, its, surface, flattened, with, a, coated, abrasive, to, achieve, a, basic, shape, and, then, have, finer, grades, of, abrasive, successively, applied, culminating, in, a, wax, paste, impregnated, with, rouge, to, leave, a, sort, of, grainless, finish, called, in, this, case, a, mirror, finish, also, different, shapes, of, adhesive, may, make, it, harder, to, abrade, certain, areas, of, the, workpiece, health, hazards, can, arise, from, any, dust, produced, which, may, be, ameliorated, through, the, use, of, a, lubricant, which, could, lead, to, silicosis, when, the, abrasive, or, workpiece, is, a, silicate, and, the, choice, of, any, lubricant, besides, water, oils, are, the, most, common, lubricants, these, may, present, inhalation, hazards, contact, hazards, and, as, friction, necessarily, produces, heat, flammable, material, hazards, an, abrasive, which, is, too, hard, or, too, coarse, can, remove, too, much, material, or, leave, undesired, scratch, marks, besides, being, unsightly, scratching, can, have, other, more, serious, effects, excessive, abrasion, or, the, presence, of, scratches, may, a, finer, or, softer, abrasive, will, tend, to, leave, much, finer, scratch, marks, which, may, even, be, invisible, to, the, naked, eye, a, grainless, finish, a, softer, abrasive, may, not, even, significantly, abrade, a, certain, object, a, softer, or, finer, abrasive, will, take, longer, to, cut, as, it, tends, to, cut, less, deeply, than, a, coarser, harder, material, also, the, softer, abrasive, may, become, less, effective, more, quickly, as, the, abrasive, is, itself, abraded, this, allows, fine, abrasives, to, be, used, in, the, polishing, of, metal, and, lenses, where, the, series, of, increasingly, fine, scratches, tends, to, take, on, a, much, more, shiny, or, reflective, appearance, or, greater, transparency, very, fine, abrasives, may, be, used, to, coat, the, strop, for, a, cut, throat, razors, however, the, purpose, of, stropping, is, not, to, abrade, material, but, to, straighten, the, burr, on, an, edge, the, final, stage, of, sharpening, japanese, swords, is, called, polishing, and, may, be, a, form, of, superfinishing, different, chemical, or, structural, modifications, may, be, made, to, alter, the, cutting, properties, of, the, abrasive, other, very, important, considerations, are, price, and, availability, diamond, for, a, long, time, considered, the, hardest, substance, in, existence, is, actually, softer, than, fullerite, and, even, harder, aggregated, diamond, nanorods, both, of, which, have, been, synthesised, in, laboratories, but, no, commercial, process, has, yet, been, developed, diamond, itself, is, expensive, due, to, scarcity, in, nature, and, the, cost, of, synthesising, it, bauxite, is, a, very, common, ore, which, along, with, corundum, s, reasonably, high, hardness, contributes, to, corundum, s, status, as, a, common, inexpensive, abrasive, thought, must, be, given, to, the, desired, task, about, using, an, appropriately, hard, abrasive, at, one, end, using, an, excessively, hard, abrasive, wastes, money, by, wearing, it, down, when, a, cheaper, less, hard, abrasive, would, suffice, at, the, other, end, if, the, abrasive, substance, is, too, soft, abrasion, does, not, take, place, in, a, timely, fashion, effectively, wasting, the, abrasive, as, well, as, any, accruing, costs, associated, with, loss, of, time, aside, from, the, aforementioned, uses, of, shaping, and, finishing, abrasives, may, also, be, used, to, prepare, surfaces, for, application, of, some, sort, of, paint, of, adhesive, an, excessively, smooth, surface, may, prevent, paint, and, adhesives, from, adhering, as, strongly, as, an, irregular, surface, could, allow, inflatable, tyre, repair, kits, which, on, bicycles, particularly, are, actually, patches, for, the, inner, tube, rather, than, the, tyre, require, use, of, an, abrasive, so, that, the, self, vulcanising, cement, will, stick, strongly, inadvertently, people, who, use, knives, on, glass, or, metal, cutting, boards, are, abrading, their, knife, blades, the, pressure, at, the, knife, edge, can, easily, create, microscopic, or, even, macroscopic, cuts, in, the, board, this, cut, is, a, ready, source, of, abrasive, material, as, well, as, a, channel, full, of, this, abrasive, through, which, the, edge, slides, for, this, reason, and, without, regard, for, the, health, benefits, wooden, boards, are, much, more, desirable, a, similar, occurrence, arises, with, glass, cutters, glass, cutters, have, circular, blades, that, are, designed, to, roll, not, slide, they, should, never, retrace, an, already, effected, cut, undesired, abrasion, may, result, from, the, presence, of, carbon, in, internal, combustion, engines, while, smaller, particles, are, readily, transported, by, the, lubrication, system, larger, carbon, particles, may, abrade, components, with, close, tolerances, the, carbon, arises, from, the, excessive, heating, of, engine, oil, or, from, incomplete, combustion, this, soot, may, contain, fullerenes, which, are, noted, for, their, extreme, hardness, and, small, size, and, limited, quantity, which, would, tend, to, limit, their, effect
