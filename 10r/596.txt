digital, photography, uses, cameras, containing, arrays, of, electronic, photodetectors, interfaced, to, an, analog, to, digital, converter, adc, to, produce, images, focused, by, a, lens, as, opposed, to, an, exposure, on, photographic, film, the, digitized, image, is, stored, as, a, computer, file, ready, for, further, digital, processing, viewing, electronic, publishing, or, digital, printing, it, is, a, form, of, digital, imaging, based, on, gathering, visible, light, or, for, scientific, instruments, light, in, various, ranges, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, until, the, advent, of, such, technology, photographs, were, made, by, exposing, light, sensitive, photographic, film, and, paper, which, was, processed, in, liquid, chemical, solutions, to, develop, and, stabilize, the, image, digital, photographs, are, typically, created, solely, by, computer, based, photoelectric, and, mechanical, techniques, without, wet, bath, chemical, processing, in, consumer, markets, apart, from, enthusiast, digital, single, lens, reflex, cameras, dslr, most, digital, cameras, now, come, with, an, electronic, viewfinder, which, approximates, the, final, photograph, in, real, time, this, enables, the, user, to, review, adjust, or, delete, a, captured, photograph, within, seconds, making, this, a, form, of, instant, photography, in, contrast, to, most, photochemical, cameras, from, the, preceding, era, moreover, the, onboard, computational, resources, can, usually, perform, aperture, adjustment, and, focus, adjustment, via, inbuilt, servomotors, as, well, as, set, the, exposure, level, automatically, so, these, technical, burdens, are, removed, from, the, photographer, unless, the, photographer, feels, competent, to, intercede, and, the, camera, offers, traditional, controls, electronic, by, nature, most, digital, cameras, are, instant, mechanized, and, automatic, in, some, or, all, functions, digital, cameras, may, choose, to, emulate, traditional, manual, controls, rings, dials, sprung, levers, and, buttons, or, it, may, instead, provide, a, touchscreen, interface, for, all, functions, most, camera, phones, fall, into, the, latter, category, digital, photography, spans, a, wide, range, of, applications, with, a, long, history, much, of, the, technology, originated, in, the, space, industry, where, it, pertains, to, highly, customized, embedded, systems, combined, with, sophisticated, remote, telemetry, any, electronic, image, sensor, can, be, digitized, this, was, achieved, in, 1951, the, modern, era, in, digital, photography, is, dominated, by, the, semiconductor, industry, which, evolved, later, an, early, semiconductor, milestone, was, the, advent, of, the, charge, coupled, device, ccd, image, sensor, first, demonstrated, in, april, 1970, since, then, the, field, has, advanced, rapidly, with, concurrent, advances, in, photolithographic, fabrication, the, first, consumer, digital, cameras, were, marketed, in, the, late, 1990s, professionals, gravitated, to, digital, slowly, converting, as, their, professional, work, required, using, digital, files, to, fulfill, demands, for, faster, turnaround, than, conventional, methods, could, allow, starting, around, 2000, digital, cameras, were, incorporated, into, cell, phones, in, the, following, years, cell, phone, cameras, became, widespread, particularly, due, to, their, connectivity, to, social, media, and, email, since, 2010, the, digital, point, and, shoot, and, dslr, cameras, have, also, seen, competition, from, the, mirrorless, digital, cameras, which, typically, provide, better, image, quality, than, point, and, shoot, or, cell, phone, cameras, but, are, smaller, in, size, and, shape, than, typical, dslrs, many, mirrorless, cameras, accept, interchangeable, lenses, and, have, advanced, features, through, an, electronic, viewfinder, which, replaces, the, through, the, lens, viewfinder, of, single, lens, reflex, cameras, while, digital, photography, has, only, relatively, recently, become, mainstream, the, late, 20th, century, saw, many, small, developments, leading, to, its, creation, the, history, of, digital, photography, began, in, the, 1950s, in, 1951, the, first, digital, signals, were, saved, to, magnetic, tape, via, the, first, video, tape, recorder, six, years, later, in, 1957, the, first, digital, image, was, produced, through, a, computer, by, russell, kirsch, it, was, an, image, of, his, son, the, first, semiconductor, image, sensor, was, the, charge, coupled, device, ccd, invented, by, physicists, willard, s, boyle, and, george, e, smith, at, bell, labs, in, 1969, while, researching, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, process, they, realized, that, an, electric, charge, was, analogous, to, a, magnetic, bubble, and, that, the, charge, could, be, stored, on, a, tiny, mos, capacitor, as, it, was, fairly, straightforward, to, fabricate, a, series, of, mos, capacitors, in, a, row, they, connected, a, suitable, voltage, to, the, capacitors, so, that, the, charge, could, be, stepped, along, from, one, to, the, next, this, semiconductor, circuit, was, later, used, in, the, first, digital, video, cameras, for, television, broadcasting, and, its, invention, was, recognized, by, a, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 2009, the, first, close, up, image, of, mars, was, taken, as, mariner, 4, flew, by, it, on, july, 15, 1965, with, a, digital, camera, system, designed, by, nasa, and, jpl, in, 1976, the, twin, mars, viking, landers, produced, the, first, images, from, the, surface, of, mars, the, imaging, process, was, different, from, that, of, a, modern, digital, camera, though, the, result, was, similar, viking, used, a, mechanically, scanned, facsimile, camera, rather, than, a, mosaic, of, solid, state, sensor, elements, this, produced, a, digital, image, that, was, stored, on, tape, for, later, relatively, slow, transmission, back, to, earth, the, first, published, color, digital, photograph, was, produced, in, 1972, by, michael, francis, tompsett, using, ccd, sensor, technology, and, was, featured, on, the, cover, of, electronics, magazine, it, was, a, picture, of, his, wife, margaret, tompsett, the, cromemco, cyclops, a, digital, camera, developed, as, a, commercial, product, and, interfaced, to, a, microcomputer, was, featured, in, the, february, 1975, issue, of, popular, electronics, magazine, it, used, mos, technology, for, its, image, sensor, an, important, development, in, digital, image, compression, technology, was, the, discrete, cosine, transform, dct, a, lossy, compression, technique, first, proposed, by, nasir, ahmed, while, he, was, working, at, the, kansas, state, university, in, 1972, dct, compression, is, used, in, the, jpeg, image, standard, which, was, introduced, by, the, joint, photographic, experts, group, in, 1992, jpeg, compresses, images, down, to, much, smaller, file, sizes, and, has, become, the, most, widely, used, image, file, format, the, jpeg, standard, was, largely, responsible, for, popularizing, digital, photography, the, first, self, contained, portable, digital, camera, was, created, in, 1975, by, steven, sasson, of, eastman, kodak, sasson, s, camera, used, ccd, image, sensor, chips, developed, by, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1973, the, camera, weighed, 8, pounds, 3, 6, kg, recorded, black, and, white, images, to, a, cassette, tape, had, a, resolution, of, 0, 01, megapixels, 10, 000, pixels, and, took, 23, seconds, to, capture, its, first, image, in, december, 1975, the, prototype, camera, was, a, technical, exercise, not, intended, for, production, while, it, was, not, until, 1981, that, the, first, consumer, camera, was, produced, by, sony, the, groundwork, for, digital, imaging, and, photography, had, been, laid, the, first, digital, single, lens, reflex, dslr, camera, was, the, nikon, svc, prototype, demonstrated, in, 1986, followed, by, the, commercial, nikon, qv, 1000c, released, in, 1988, the, first, widely, commercially, available, digital, camera, was, the, 1990, dycam, model, 1, it, also, sold, as, the, logitech, fotoman, it, used, a, ccd, image, sensor, stored, pictures, digitally, and, connected, directly, to, a, computer, for, downloading, images, originally, offered, to, professional, photographers, for, a, hefty, price, by, the, mid, to, late, 1990s, due, to, technology, advancements, digital, cameras, were, commonly, available, to, the, general, public, the, advent, of, digital, photography, also, gave, way, to, cultural, changes, in, the, field, of, photography, unlike, film, photography, dark, rooms, and, hazardous, chemicals, were, no, longer, required, for, the, post, production, of, an, image, images, could, now, be, processed, and, enhanced, from, a, personal, computer, this, allowed, photographers, to, be, more, creative, with, their, processing, and, editing, techniques, as, the, field, became, more, popular, digital, photography, and, photographers, diversified, digital, photography, expanded, the, field, of, photography, from, a, small, somewhat, elite, circle, to, one, that, encompassed, many, people, the, camera, phone, further, helped, popularize, digital, photography, along, with, the, internet, social, media, and, the, jpeg, image, format, the, first, cell, phones, with, built, in, digital, cameras, were, produced, in, 2000, by, sharp, and, samsung, small, convenient, and, easy, to, use, camera, phones, have, made, digital, photography, ubiquitous, in, the, daily, life, of, the, general, public, image, sensors, are, arrays, of, electronic, devices, that, convert, the, optical, image, created, by, the, camera, lens, into, a, digital, file, that, is, stored, in, some, digital, memory, device, inside, or, outside, the, camera, each, element, of, the, image, sensor, array, measures, the, intensity, of, light, hitting, a, small, area, of, the, projected, image, a, pixel, and, converts, it, to, a, digital, value, the, two, main, types, of, sensors, are, charge, coupled, devices, ccd, in, which, the, photo, charge, is, shifted, to, a, central, charge, to, voltage, converter, and, cmos, or, active, pixel, sensors, most, cameras, for, the, general, consumer, market, create, color, images, in, which, each, pixel, has, a, color, value, from, a, three, dimensional, color, space, like, rgb, although, there, is, light, sensing, technology, that, can, distinguish, the, wavelength, of, the, light, incident, on, each, pixel, most, cameras, use, monochrome, sensors, that, can, only, record, the, intensity, of, that, light, over, a, broad, range, of, wavelengths, that, includes, all, the, visible, spectrum, to, obtain, color, images, those, cameras, depend, on, color, filters, applied, over, each, pixel, typically, in, a, bayer, pattern, or, rarely, on, movable, filters, or, light, splitters, such, as, dichroic, mirrors, the, resulting, grayscale, images, are, then, combined, to, produce, a, color, image, this, step, is, usually, performed, by, the, camera, itself, although, some, cameras, may, optionally, provide, the, unprocessed, grayscale, images, in, a, so, called, raw, image, format, however, some, special, purpose, cameras, such, as, those, for, thermal, mapping, or, low, light, viewing, or, high, speed, capture, may, record, only, monochrome, grayscale, images, the, leica, monochrom, cameras, for, example, opted, for, a, grayscale, only, sensor, to, get, better, resolution, and, dynamic, range, the, reduction, from, three, dimensional, color, to, grayscale, or, simulated, sepia, toning, may, also, be, performed, by, digital, post, processing, often, as, an, option, in, the, camera, itself, on, the, other, hand, some, multispectral, cameras, may, record, more, than, three, color, coordinates, for, each, pixel, in, most, digital, camera, except, some, high, end, linear, array, cameras, and, simple, low, end, webcams, a, digital, memory, device, is, used, for, storing, images, which, may, be, transferred, to, a, computer, later, this, memory, device, is, usually, a, memory, card, floppy, disks, and, cd, rws, are, less, common, in, addition, to, taking, pictures, digital, cameras, may, also, record, sound, and, video, some, function, as, webcams, some, use, the, pictbridge, standard, to, connect, to, printers, without, using, a, computer, and, some, can, display, pictures, directly, on, a, television, set, similarly, many, camcorders, can, take, still, photographs, and, store, them, on, videotape, or, flash, memory, cards, with, the, same, functionality, as, digital, cameras, digital, photography, is, an, example, of, the, shift, from, analog, information, to, digital, information, in, the, past, conventional, photography, was, an, entirely, chemical, and, mechanical, process, that, did, not, require, electricity, now, modern, photography, is, a, digital, process, in, which, analog, signals, are, converted, to, and, stored, as, digital, data, using, built, in, computers, the, quality, of, a, digital, image, is, a, composite, of, various, factors, many, of, which, are, similar, to, those, of, film, cameras, pixel, count, typically, listed, in, megapixels, millions, of, pixels, is, only, one, of, the, major, factors, though, it, is, the, most, heavily, marketed, figure, of, merit, digital, camera, manufacturers, advertise, this, figure, because, consumers, can, use, it, to, easily, compare, camera, capabilities, it, is, not, however, the, major, factor, in, evaluating, a, digital, camera, for, most, applications, the, processing, system, inside, the, camera, that, turns, the, raw, data, into, a, color, balanced, and, pleasing, photograph, is, usually, more, critical, which, is, why, some, 4, megapixel, cameras, perform, better, than, higher, end, cameras, resolution, in, pixels, is, not, the, only, measure, of, image, quality, a, larger, sensor, with, the, same, number, of, pixels, generally, produces, a, better, image, than, a, smaller, one, one, of, the, most, important, benefits, of, this, is, a, reduction, in, image, noise, this, is, one, of, the, advantages, of, dslr, cameras, which, have, larger, sensors, than, simpler, point, and, shoot, cameras, of, the, same, resolution, additional, factors, that, impact, the, quality, of, a, digital, image, include, the, number, of, pixels, n, for, a, given, maximum, resolution, w, horizontal, pixels, by, h, vertical, pixels, is, the, product, n, w, h, for, example, an, image, 1600, 1200, in, size, has, 1, 920, 000, pixels, or, 1, 92, megapixels, the, pixel, count, quoted, by, manufacturers, can, be, misleading, as, it, may, not, be, the, number, of, full, color, pixels, for, cameras, using, single, chip, image, sensors, the, number, claimed, is, the, total, number, of, single, color, sensitive, photosensors, whether, they, have, different, locations, in, the, plane, as, with, the, bayer, sensor, or, in, stacks, of, three, co, located, photosensors, as, in, the, foveon, x3, sensor, however, the, images, have, different, numbers, of, rgb, pixels, bayer, sensor, cameras, produce, as, many, rgb, pixels, as, photosensors, via, demosaicing, interpolation, while, foveon, sensors, produce, uninterpolated, image, files, with, one, third, as, many, rgb, pixels, as, photosensors, comparisons, of, megapixel, ratings, of, these, two, types, of, sensors, are, sometimes, a, subject, of, dispute, the, relative, increase, in, detail, resulting, from, an, increase, in, resolution, is, better, compared, by, looking, at, the, number, of, pixels, across, or, down, the, picture, rather, than, the, total, number, of, pixels, in, the, picture, area, for, example, a, sensor, of, 2560, 1600, sensor, elements, is, described, as, 4, megapixels, 2560, 1600, 4, 096, 000, increasing, to, 3200, 2048, increases, the, pixels, in, the, picture, to, 6, 553, 600, 6, 5, megapixels, a, factor, of, 1, 6, but, the, pixels, per, cm, in, the, picture, at, the, same, image, size, increases, by, only, 1, 25, times, a, measure, of, the, comparative, increase, in, linear, resolution, is, the, square, root, of, the, increase, in, area, resolution, i, e, megapixels, in, the, entire, image, both, digital, and, film, practical, imaging, systems, have, a, limited, dynamic, range, the, range, of, luminosity, that, can, be, reproduced, accurately, highlights, of, the, subject, that, are, too, bright, are, rendered, as, white, with, no, detail, overexposure, shadows, that, are, too, dark, are, rendered, as, black, underexposure, the, loss, of, detail, in, the, highlights, is, not, abrupt, with, film, or, in, dark, shadows, with, digital, sensors, highlight, burn, out, of, digital, sensors, is, not, usually, abrupt, in, output, images, due, to, the, tone, mapping, required, to, fit, their, large, dynamic, range, into, the, more, limited, dynamic, range, of, the, output, be, it, sdr, display, or, printing, because, sensor, elements, for, different, colors, saturate, in, turn, there, can, be, hue, or, saturation, shift, in, burnt, out, highlights, some, digital, cameras, can, show, these, blown, highlights, in, the, image, review, allowing, the, photographer, to, re, shoot, the, picture, with, a, modified, exposure, others, compensate, for, the, total, contrast, of, a, scene, by, selectively, exposing, darker, pixels, longer, a, third, technique, is, used, by, fujifilm, in, its, finepix, s3, pro, dslr, the, image, sensor, contains, additional, photodiodes, of, lower, sensitivity, than, the, main, ones, these, retain, detail, in, parts, of, the, image, too, bright, for, the, main, sensor, high, dynamic, range, imaging, hdr, addresses, this, problem, by, increasing, the, dynamic, range, of, images, by, either, many, camera, phones, and, most, digital, cameras, use, memory, cards, with, flash, memory, to, store, image, data, the, majority, of, cards, for, separate, cameras, are, secure, digital, sd, format, or, the, older, compactflash, cf, format, other, formats, are, rare, xqd, card, format, was, the, last, new, form, of, card, targeted, at, high, definition, camcorders, and, high, resolution, digital, photo, cameras, most, modern, digital, cameras, also, use, internal, memory, of, limited, capacity, to, hold, pictures, temporarily, regardless, of, whether, or, not, the, camera, is, equipped, with, a, memory, card, these, pictures, can, then, be, transferred, later, to, a, memory, card, or, external, device, memory, cards, can, hold, vast, numbers, of, photos, requiring, attention, only, when, the, memory, card, is, full, for, most, users, this, means, hundreds, of, quality, photos, stored, on, the, same, memory, card, images, may, be, transferred, to, other, media, for, archival, or, personal, use, cards, with, high, speed, and, capacity, are, suited, to, video, and, burst, mode, capture, several, photographs, in, quick, succession, because, photographers, rely, on, the, integrity, of, image, files, it, is, important, to, take, proper, care, of, memory, cards, one, process, is, card, formatting, which, essentially, involves, scanning, the, cards, for, possible, errors, common, advocacy, calls, for, formatting, cards, after, transferring, its, images, onto, a, computer, since, all, cameras, only, do, quick, formatting, of, cards, it, is, advisable, to, occasionally, carry, out, a, more, thorough, formatting, using, appropriate, software, on, a, computer, the, primary, advantage, of, consumer, level, digital, cameras, is, the, low, recurring, cost, as, users, need, not, purchase, photographic, film, processing, costs, may, be, reduced, or, even, eliminated, digicams, tend, also, to, be, easier, to, carry, and, use, than, comparable, film, cameras, and, more, easily, adapt, to, modern, use, of, pictures, some, particularly, those, in, smartphones, can, send, their, pictures, directly, to, email, web, pages, or, other, electronic, distribution, in, professional, usage, digital, cameras, offer, many, advantages, in, speed, precision, flexibility, ease, and, cost, manufacturers, such, as, nikon, and, canon, have, promoted, the, adoption, of, digital, single, lens, reflex, cameras, dslrs, by, photojournalists, images, captured, at, 2, megapixels, are, deemed, of, sufficient, quality, for, small, images, in, newspaper, or, magazine, reproduction, 8, to, 24, megapixel, images, found, in, modern, digital, slrs, when, combined, with, high, end, lenses, can, approximate, the, detail, of, film, prints, from, 35, mm, film, based, slrs, noise, in, a, digital, camera, s, image, may, sometimes, be, visually, similar, to, film, grain, in, a, film, camera, turn, of, the, century, digital, cameras, had, a, long, start, up, delay, compared, to, film, cameras, that, is, the, delay, from, when, they, are, turned, on, until, they, are, ready, to, take, the, first, shot, but, this, is, no, longer, the, case, for, modern, digital, cameras, which, have, start, up, times, under, 1, 4, seconds, while, some, film, cameras, could, reach, up, to, 14, frames, per, second, fps, like, the, canon, f, 1, with, its, rare, high, speed, motor, drive, professional, dslr, cameras, can, take, still, photographs, at, the, highest, frame, rates, while, the, sony, slt, technology, allows, rates, of, up, to, 12, fps, the, canon, eos, 1d, x, can, take, stills, at, a, rate, of, 14, fps, the, nikon, f5, is, limited, to, 36, continuous, frames, the, length, of, the, film, without, the, cumbersome, bulk, film, back, while, the, digital, nikon, d5, is, able, to, capture, over, 100, 14, bit, raw, images, before, its, buffer, must, be, cleared, and, the, remaining, space, on, the, storage, media, can, be, used, depending, on, the, materials, and, how, they, are, stored, analog, photographic, film, and, prints, may, fade, as, they, age, similarly, the, media, on, which, digital, images, are, stored, or, printed, can, decay, or, become, corrupt, leading, to, a, loss, of, image, integrity, color, reproduction, gamut, depends, on, the, type, and, quality, of, film, or, sensor, used, and, the, quality, of, the, optical, system, and, film, processing, different, films, and, sensors, have, different, color, sensitivity, the, photographer, needs, to, understand, their, equipment, the, lighting, conditions, and, the, media, used, to, ensure, accurate, color, reproduction, many, digital, cameras, offer, raw, format, sensor, data, which, makes, it, possible, to, choose, the, color, gamut, in, the, development, stage, regardless, of, camera, settings, even, in, raw, format, however, the, sensor, and, the, camera, s, dynamics, can, only, capture, colors, within, the, gamut, supported, by, the, hardware, when, that, image, is, transferred, for, reproduction, on, any, device, the, widest, achievable, gamut, is, the, gamut, that, the, end, device, supports, for, a, monitor, it, is, the, gamut, of, the, display, device, for, a, photographic, print, it, is, the, gamut, of, the, device, that, prints, the, image, on, a, specific, type, of, paper, professional, photographers, often, use, specially, designed, and, calibrated, monitors, that, help, them, to, reproduce, color, accurately, and, consistently, most, digital, point, and, shoot, cameras, have, an, aspect, ratio, of, 1, 33, 4, 3, the, same, as, analog, television, or, early, movies, however, a, 35, mm, picture, s, aspect, ratio, is, 1, 5, 3, 2, several, digital, cameras, take, photos, in, either, ratio, nearly, all, digital, slrs, take, pictures, in, a, 3, 2, ratio, as, most, can, use, lenses, designed, for, 35, mm, film, some, photo, labs, print, photos, on, 4, 3, ratio, paper, as, well, as, the, existing, 3, 2, in, 2005, panasonic, launched, the, first, consumer, camera, with, a, native, aspect, ratio, of, 16, 9, matching, hdtv, this, is, similar, to, a, 7, 4, aspect, ratio, which, was, a, common, size, for, aps, film, different, aspect, ratios, are, one, of, the, reasons, consumers, have, issues, when, cropping, photos, an, aspect, ratio, of, 4, 3, translates, to, a, size, of, 4, 5, 6, 0, this, loses, half, an, inch, when, printing, on, the, standard, size, of, 4, 6, an, aspect, ratio, of, 3, 2, similar, cropping, occurs, when, printing, on, other, sizes, such, as, 5, 7, 8, 10, or, 11, 14, in, late, 2002, the, cheapest, digital, cameras, in, the, united, states, were, available, for, around, 100, usd, at, the, same, time, many, discount, stores, with, photo, labs, introduced, a, digital, front, end, allowing, consumers, to, obtain, true, chemical, prints, as, opposed, to, ink, jet, prints, in, an, hour, these, prices, were, similar, to, those, of, prints, made, from, film, negatives, in, july, 2003, digital, cameras, entered, the, disposable, camera, market, with, the, release, of, the, ritz, dakota, digital, a, 1, 2, megapixel, 1280, 960, cmos, based, digital, camera, costing, only, 11, following, the, familiar, single, use, concept, long, in, use, with, film, cameras, ritz, intended, the, dakota, digital, for, single, use, when, the, pre, programmed, 25, picture, limit, is, reached, the, camera, is, returned, to, the, store, and, the, consumer, receives, back, prints, and, a, cd, rom, with, their, photos, the, camera, is, then, refurbished, and, resold, since, the, introduction, of, the, dakota, digital, a, number, of, similar, single, use, digital, cameras, have, appeared, most, single, use, digital, cameras, are, nearly, identical, to, the, original, dakota, digital, in, specifications, and, function, though, a, few, include, superior, specifications, and, more, advanced, functions, such, as, higher, image, resolutions, and, lcd, screens, most, if, not, all, these, single, use, digital, cameras, cost, less, than, 20, not, including, processing, however, the, huge, demand, for, complex, digital, cameras, at, competitive, prices, has, often, caused, manufacturing, shortcuts, evidenced, by, a, large, increase, in, customer, complaints, over, camera, malfunctions, high, parts, prices, and, short, service, life, some, digital, cameras, offer, only, a, 90, day, warranty, since, 2003, digital, cameras, have, outsold, film, cameras, prices, of, 35, mm, compact, cameras, have, dropped, with, manufacturers, further, outsourcing, to, countries, such, as, china, kodak, announced, in, january, 2004, that, they, would, no, longer, sell, kodak, branded, film, cameras, in, the, developed, world, in, january, 2006, nikon, followed, suit, and, announced, they, would, stop, production, of, all, but, two, models, of, their, film, cameras, they, will, continue, to, produce, the, low, end, nikon, fm10, and, the, high, end, nikon, f6, in, the, same, month, konica, minolta, announced, it, was, pulling, out, of, the, camera, business, altogether, the, price, of, 35, mm, and, advanced, photo, system, aps, compact, cameras, have, dropped, probably, due, to, direct, competition, from, digital, cameras, and, the, resulting, availability, of, second, hand, film, cameras, pentax, have, reduced, but, not, halted, production, of, film, cameras, the, technology, has, improved, so, rapidly, that, one, of, kodak, s, film, cameras, was, discontinued, before, it, was, awarded, a, camera, of, the, year, award, later, in, the, year, the, decline, in, film, camera, sales, has, also, led, to, a, decline, in, purchases, of, film, for, such, cameras, in, november, 2004, a, german, division, of, agfa, gevaert, agfaphoto, split, off, within, six, months, it, filed, for, bankruptcy, konica, minolta, photo, imaging, inc, ended, production, of, color, film, and, paper, worldwide, by, march, 31, 2007, in, addition, by, 2005, kodak, employed, less, than, a, third, of, the, employees, it, had, twenty, years, earlier, it, is, not, known, if, these, job, losses, in, the, film, industry, have, been, offset, in, the, digital, image, industry, digital, cameras, have, decimated, the, film, photography, industry, through, the, declining, use, of, the, expensive, film, rolls, and, development, chemicals, previously, required, to, develop, the, photos, this, has, had, a, dramatic, effect, on, companies, such, as, fuji, kodak, and, agfa, many, stores, that, formerly, offered, photofinishing, services, or, sold, film, no, longer, do, or, have, seen, a, tremendous, decline, in, 2012, kodak, filed, for, bankruptcy, after, struggling, to, adapt, to, the, changing, industry, digital, camera, sales, peaked, in, march, 2012, averaging, about, 11, million, units, a, month, but, sales, have, declined, significantly, ever, since, by, march, 2014, about, 3, million, were, purchased, each, month, about, 30, percent, of, the, peak, sales, total, the, decline, may, have, bottomed, out, with, sales, average, hovering, around, 3, million, a, month, the, main, competitor, is, smartphones, most, of, which, have, built, in, digital, cameras, and, are, routinely, improved, like, most, digital, cameras, they, also, offer, the, ability, to, record, videos, while, smartphones, continue, to, improve, on, a, technical, level, their, form, factor, is, not, optimized, for, use, as, a, camera, and, their, battery, life, is, typically, more, limited, compared, to, a, digital, camera, digital, photography, has, resulted, in, some, positive, market, impacts, as, well, the, increasing, popularity, of, products, such, as, digital, photo, frames, and, canvas, prints, is, a, direct, result, of, the, increasing, popularity, of, digital, photography, digital, photography, has, made, photography, available, to, a, larger, group, of, people, new, technology, and, editing, programs, available, to, photographers, have, changed, the, way, photographs, are, presented, to, the, public, photographs, can, be, heavily, manipulated, or, photoshopped, to, look, completely, different, from, the, originals, until, the, advent, of, the, digital, camera, amateur, photographers, used, either, print, or, slide, film, for, their, cameras, slides, had, to, be, developed, and, shown, to, an, audience, using, a, slide, projector, digital, photography, eliminated, the, delay, and, cost, of, film, consumers, became, able, to, view, transfer, edit, and, distribute, digital, images, with, ordinary, home, computers, rather, than, using, specialized, equipment, camera, phones, have, recently, had, a, large, impact, on, photography, users, can, set, their, smartphones, to, upload, products, to, the, internet, preserving, images, even, if, the, camera, is, destroyed, or, the, photos, deleted, some, high, street, photography, shops, have, self, service, kiosks, that, allow, images, to, be, printed, directly, from, smartphones, via, bluetooth, technology, archivists, and, historians, have, noticed, the, transitory, nature, of, digital, media, unlike, film, and, print, which, are, tangible, digital, image, storage, is, ever, changing, with, old, media, and, decoding, software, becoming, obsolete, or, inaccessible, by, new, technologies, historians, are, concerned, that, this, is, creating, a, historical, void, where, information, is, being, silently, lost, within, failed, or, inaccessible, digital, media, they, recommend, that, professional, and, amateur, users, develop, strategies, for, digital, preservation, by, migrating, stored, digital, images, from, old, technologies, to, new, ones, scrapbookers, who, may, have, used, film, for, creating, artistic, and, personal, memoirs, may, need, to, modify, their, approach, to, use, and, personalize, digital, photo, books, thereby, retaining, the, special, qualities, of, traditional, photo, albums, the, web, has, been, a, popular, medium, for, storing, and, sharing, photos, ever, since, the, first, photograph, was, published, online, by, tim, berners, lee, in, 1992, an, image, of, the, cern, house, band, les, horribles, cernettes, today, photo, sharing, sites, such, as, flickr, picasa, and, photobucket, as, well, as, social, websites, are, used, by, millions, of, people, to, share, their, pictures, digital, photography, and, social, media, allow, organizations, and, corporations, to, make, photographs, more, accessible, to, a, greater, and, more, diverse, population, for, example, national, geographic, magazine, has, twitter, snapchat, facebook, and, instagram, accounts, each, of, which, includes, content, aimed, at, the, specific, audiences, found, on, its, platform, digital, photography, has, also, impacted, other, fields, such, as, medicine, it, has, allowed, doctors, to, help, diagnose, diabetic, retinopathy, and, is, used, in, hospitals, to, diagnose, and, treat, other, diseases, in, digital, art, and, media, art, digital, photos, are, often, edited, manipulated, or, combined, with, other, digital, images, scanography, is, a, related, process, in, which,

not, meant, to, carry, the, same, value, or, artistic, qualities, as, of, today, advancements, in, digital, photography, have, sky, rocketed, due, to, the, introduction, of, mirrorless, cameras, due, to, their, cutting, edge, technology, portability, and, versatility, being, more, compact, and, innovative, mirrorless, cameras, are, preferred, with, its, manual, controls, adjustable, settings, interchangeable, lenses, and, having, an, electronic, viewfinder, or, lcd, screen, to, display, images, straight, from, the, sensor, mirrorless, cameras, have, the, advantage, over, dslrs, while, mirrorless, cameras, also, provide, quick, autofocus, silent, operations, and, quick, shooting, rates, they, also, have, some, drawbacks, like, a, restricted, range, of, lenses, and, a, shorter, battery, life, however, progress, still, continues, as, of, 2024, ongoing, advancements, in, mirrorless, technology, continue, to, address, these, limitations, solidifying, their, position, as, a, leading, choice, for, photographers, the, rise, of, mirrorless, cameras, has, changed, digital, photography, these, cameras, are, popular, for, their, modern, tech, portability, and, versatility, unlike, dslrs, mirrorless, cameras, have, electronic, viewfinders, or, lcd, screens, for, previewing, photos, and, manual, controls, they, are, smaller, and, lighter, but, may, have, fewer, lens, options, and, shorter, battery, life, ongoing, improvements, are, making, them, even, better, mirrorless, cameras, give, photographers, new, ways, to, shoot, like, seeing, previews, on, the, lcd,
