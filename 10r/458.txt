a, microphone, colloquially, called, a, mic, m, a, k, or, mike, is, a, transducer, that, converts, sound, into, an, electrical, signal, microphones, are, used, in, many, applications, such, as, telephones, hearing, aids, public, address, systems, for, concert, halls, and, public, events, motion, picture, production, live, and, recorded, audio, engineering, sound, recording, two, way, radios, megaphones, and, radio, and, television, broadcasting, they, are, also, used, in, computers, and, other, electronic, devices, such, as, mobile, phones, for, recording, sounds, speech, recognition, voip, and, other, purposes, such, as, ultrasonic, sensors, or, knock, sensors, several, types, of, microphone, are, used, today, which, employ, different, methods, to, convert, the, air, pressure, variations, of, a, sound, wave, to, an, electrical, signal, the, most, common, are, the, dynamic, microphone, which, uses, a, coil, of, wire, suspended, in, a, magnetic, field, the, condenser, microphone, which, uses, the, vibrating, diaphragm, as, a, capacitor, plate, and, the, contact, microphone, which, uses, a, crystal, of, piezoelectric, material, microphones, typically, need, to, be, connected, to, a, preamplifier, before, the, signal, can, be, recorded, or, reproduced, in, order, to, speak, to, larger, groups, of, people, a, need, arose, to, increase, the, volume, of, the, human, voice, the, earliest, devices, used, to, achieve, this, were, acoustic, megaphones, some, of, the, first, examples, from, fifth, century, bc, greece, were, theater, masks, with, horn, shaped, mouth, openings, that, acoustically, amplified, the, voice, of, actors, in, amphitheaters, in, 1665, the, english, physicist, robert, hooke, was, the, first, to, experiment, with, a, medium, other, than, air, with, the, invention, of, the, lovers, telephone, made, of, stretched, wire, with, a, cup, attached, at, each, end, in, 1856, italian, inventor, antonio, meucci, developed, a, dynamic, microphone, based, on, the, generation, of, electric, current, by, moving, a, coil, of, wire, to, various, depths, in, a, magnetic, field, this, method, of, modulation, was, also, the, most, enduring, method, for, the, technology, of, the, telephone, as, well, speaking, of, his, device, meucci, wrote, in, 1857, it, consists, of, a, vibrating, diaphragm, and, an, electrified, magnet, with, a, spiral, wire, that, wraps, around, it, the, vibrating, diaphragm, alters, the, current, of, the, magnet, these, alterations, of, current, transmitted, to, the, other, end, of, the, wire, create, analogous, vibrations, of, the, receiving, diaphragm, and, reproduce, the, word, in, 1861, german, inventor, johann, philipp, reis, built, an, early, sound, transmitter, the, reis, telephone, that, used, a, metallic, strip, attached, to, a, vibrating, membrane, that, would, produce, intermittent, current, better, results, were, achieved, in, 1876, with, the, liquid, transmitter, design, in, early, telephones, from, alexander, graham, bell, and, elisha, gray, the, diaphragm, was, attached, to, a, conductive, rod, in, an, acid, solution, these, systems, however, gave, a, very, poor, sound, quality, the, first, microphone, that, enabled, proper, voice, telephony, was, the, loose, contact, carbon, microphone, this, was, independently, developed, by, david, edward, hughes, in, england, and, emile, berliner, and, thomas, edison, in, the, us, although, edison, was, awarded, the, first, patent, after, a, long, legal, dispute, in, mid, 1877, hughes, had, demonstrated, his, working, device, in, front, of, many, witnesses, some, years, earlier, and, most, historians, credit, him, with, its, invention, the, berliner, microphone, found, commercial, success, through, the, use, by, alexander, graham, bell, for, his, telephone, and, berliner, became, employed, by, bell, the, carbon, microphone, was, critical, in, the, development, of, telephony, broadcasting, and, the, recording, industries, thomas, edison, refined, the, carbon, microphone, into, his, carbon, button, transmitter, of, 1886, this, microphone, was, employed, at, the, first, radio, broadcast, ever, a, performance, at, the, new, york, metropolitan, opera, house, in, 1910, in, 1916, e, c, wente, of, western, electric, developed, the, next, breakthrough, with, the, first, condenser, microphone, in, 1923, the, first, practical, moving, coil, microphone, was, built, the, marconi, sykes, magnetophone, developed, by, captain, h, j, round, became, the, standard, for, bbc, studios, in, london, this, was, improved, in, 1930, by, alan, blumlein, and, herbert, holman, who, released, the, hb1a, and, was, the, best, standard, of, the, day, also, in, 1923, the, ribbon, microphone, was, introduced, another, electromagnetic, type, believed, to, have, been, developed, by, harry, f, olson, who, applied, the, concept, used, in, a, ribbon, speaker, to, making, a, microphone, over, the, years, these, microphones, were, developed, by, several, companies, most, notably, rca, that, made, large, advancements, in, pattern, control, to, give, the, microphone, directionality, with, television, and, film, technology, booming, there, was, a, demand, for, high, fidelity, microphones, and, greater, directionality, electro, voice, responded, with, their, academy, award, winning, shotgun, microphone, in, 1963, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, development, advanced, quickly, with, the, shure, brothers, bringing, out, the, sm58, and, sm57, microphones, are, categorized, by, their, transducer, principle, condenser, dynamic, etc, and, by, their, directional, characteristics, omni, cardioid, etc, sometimes, other, characteristics, such, as, diaphragm, size, intended, use, or, orientation, of, the, principal, sound, input, to, the, principal, axis, end, or, side, address, of, the, microphone, are, used, to, describe, the, microphone, the, condenser, microphone, invented, at, western, electric, in, 1916, by, e, c, wente, is, also, called, a, capacitor, microphone, or, electrostatic, microphone, capacitors, were, historically, called, condensers, the, diaphragm, acts, as, one, plate, of, a, capacitor, and, audio, vibrations, produce, changes, in, the, distance, between, the, plates, because, the, capacitance, of, the, plates, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, distance, between, them, the, vibrations, produce, changes, in, capacitance, these, changes, in, capacitance, are, used, to, measure, the, audio, signal, the, assembly, of, fixed, and, movable, plates, is, called, an, element, or, capsule, condenser, microphones, span, the, range, from, telephone, mouthpieces, through, inexpensive, karaoke, microphones, to, high, fidelity, recording, microphones, they, generally, produce, a, high, quality, audio, signal, and, are, now, the, popular, choice, in, laboratory, and, recording, studio, applications, the, inherent, suitability, of, this, technology, is, due, to, the, very, small, mass, that, must, be, moved, by, the, incident, sound, wave, compared, to, other, microphone, types, that, require, the, sound, wave, to, do, more, work, condenser, microphones, require, a, power, source, provided, either, via, microphone, inputs, on, equipment, as, phantom, power, or, from, a, small, battery, power, is, necessary, for, establishing, the, capacitor, plate, voltage, and, is, also, needed, to, power, the, microphone, electronics, condenser, microphones, are, also, available, with, two, diaphragms, that, can, be, electrically, connected, to, provide, a, range, of, polar, patterns, such, as, cardioid, omnidirectional, and, figure, eight, it, is, also, possible, to, vary, the, pattern, continuously, with, some, microphones, for, example, the, r, de, nt2000, or, cad, m179, there, are, two, main, categories, of, condenser, microphones, depending, on, the, method, of, extracting, the, audio, signal, from, the, transducer, dc, biased, microphones, and, radio, frequency, rf, or, high, frequency, hf, condenser, microphones, with, a, dc, biased, condenser, microphone, the, plates, are, biased, with, a, fixed, charge, q, the, voltage, maintained, across, the, capacitor, plates, changes, with, the, vibrations, in, the, air, according, to, the, capacitance, equation, c, q, v, where, q, charge, in, coulombs, c, capacitance, in, farads, and, v, potential, difference, in, volts, a, nearly, constant, charge, is, maintained, on, the, capacitor, as, the, capacitance, changes, the, charge, across, the, capacitor, does, change, very, slightly, but, at, audible, frequencies, it, is, sensibly, constant, the, capacitance, of, the, capsule, around, 5, to, 100, pf, and, the, value, of, the, bias, resistor, 100, m, to, tens, of, g, form, a, filter, that, is, high, pass, for, the, audio, signal, and, low, pass, for, the, bias, voltage, note, that, the, time, constant, of, an, rc, circuit, equals, the, product, of, the, resistance, and, capacitance, within, the, time, frame, of, the, capacitance, change, as, much, as, 50, ms, at, 20, hz, audio, signal, the, charge, is, practically, constant, and, the, voltage, across, the, capacitor, changes, instantaneously, to, reflect, the, change, in, capacitance, the, voltage, across, the, capacitor, varies, above, and, below, the, bias, voltage, the, voltage, difference, between, the, bias, and, the, capacitor, is, seen, across, the, series, resistor, the, voltage, across, the, resistor, is, amplified, for, performance, or, recording, in, most, cases, the, electronics, in, the, microphone, itself, contribute, no, voltage, gain, as, the, voltage, differential, is, quite, significant, up, to, several, volts, for, high, sound, levels, rf, condenser, microphones, use, a, comparatively, low, rf, voltage, generated, by, a, low, noise, oscillator, the, signal, from, the, oscillator, may, either, be, amplitude, modulated, by, the, capacitance, changes, produced, by, the, sound, waves, moving, the, capsule, diaphragm, or, the, capsule, may, be, part, of, a, resonant, circuit, that, modulates, the, frequency, of, the, oscillator, signal, demodulation, yields, a, low, noise, audio, frequency, signal, with, a, very, low, source, impedance, the, absence, of, a, high, bias, voltage, permits, the, use, of, a, diaphragm, with, looser, tension, which, may, be, used, to, achieve, wider, frequency, response, due, to, higher, compliance, the, rf, biasing, process, results, in, a, lower, electrical, impedance, capsule, a, useful, by, product, of, which, is, that, rf, condenser, microphones, can, be, operated, in, damp, weather, conditions, that, could, create, problems, in, dc, biased, microphones, with, contaminated, insulating, surfaces, the, sennheiser, mkh, series, of, microphones, use, the, rf, biasing, technique, a, covert, remotely, energized, application, of, the, same, physical, principle, called, the, thing, was, devised, by, soviet, russian, inventor, leon, theremin, and, used, to, bug, the, us, ambassador, s, residence, in, moscow, between, 1945, and, 1952, an, electret, microphone, is, a, type, of, condenser, microphone, invented, by, gerhard, sessler, and, jim, west, at, bell, laboratories, in, 1962, the, externally, applied, charge, used, for, a, conventional, condenser, microphone, is, replaced, by, a, permanent, charge, in, an, electret, material, an, electret, is, a, ferroelectric, material, that, has, been, permanently, electrically, charged, or, polarized, the, name, comes, from, electrostatic, and, magnet, a, static, charge, is, embedded, in, an, electret, by, the, alignment, of, the, static, charges, in, the, material, much, the, way, a, permanent, magnet, is, made, by, aligning, the, magnetic, domains, in, a, piece, of, iron, due, to, their, good, performance, and, ease, of, manufacture, hence, low, cost, the, vast, majority, of, microphones, made, today, are, electret, microphones, a, semiconductor, manufacturer, estimates, annual, production, at, over, one, billion, units, they, are, used, in, many, applications, from, high, quality, recording, and, lavalier, lapel, mic, use, to, built, in, microphones, in, small, sound, recording, devices, and, telephones, prior, to, the, proliferation, of, mems, microphones, nearly, all, cell, phone, computer, pda, and, headset, microphones, were, electret, types, unlike, other, capacitor, microphones, they, require, no, polarizing, voltage, but, often, contain, an, integrated, preamplifier, that, does, require, power, this, preamplifier, is, frequently, phantom, powered, in, sound, reinforcement, and, studio, applications, monophonic, microphones, designed, for, personal, computers, pcs, sometimes, called, multimedia, microphones, use, a, 3, 5, mm, plug, as, usually, used, for, stereo, connections, the, ring, instead, of, carrying, the, signal, for, a, second, channel, carries, power, a, valve, microphone, is, a, condenser, microphone, that, uses, a, vacuum, tube, valve, amplifier, they, remain, popular, with, enthusiasts, of, tube, sound, the, dynamic, microphone, also, known, as, the, moving, coil, microphone, works, via, electromagnetic, induction, they, are, robust, relatively, inexpensive, and, resistant, to, moisture, this, coupled, with, their, potentially, high, gain, before, feedback, makes, them, ideal, for, on, stage, use, dynamic, microphones, use, the, same, dynamic, principle, as, in, a, loudspeaker, only, reversed, a, small, movable, induction, coil, positioned, in, the, magnetic, field, of, a, permanent, magnet, is, attached, to, the, diaphragm, when, sound, enters, through, the, windscreen, of, the, microphone, the, sound, wave, moves, the, diaphragm, when, the, diaphragm, vibrates, the, coil, moves, in, the, magnetic, field, producing, a, varying, voltage, across, the, coil, through, electromagnetic, induction, a, single, dynamic, membrane, does, not, respond, linearly, to, all, audio, frequencies, for, this, reason, some, microphones, utilize, multiple, membranes, for, the, different, parts, of, the, audio, spectrum, and, then, combine, the, resulting, signals, combining, the, multiple, signals, correctly, is, difficult, designs, that, do, this, are, rare, and, tend, to, be, expensive, on, the, other, hand, there, are, several, designs, that, are, more, specifically, aimed, towards, isolated, parts, of, the, audio, spectrum, the, akg, d112, for, example, is, designed, for, bass, response, rather, than, treble, ribbon, microphones, use, a, thin, usually, corrugated, metal, ribbon, suspended, in, a, magnetic, field, the, ribbon, is, electrically, connected, to, the, microphone, s, output, and, its, vibration, within, the, magnetic, field, generates, the, electrical, signal, ribbon, microphones, are, similar, to, moving, coil, microphones, in, the, sense, that, both, produce, sound, by, means, of, magnetic, induction, basic, ribbon, microphones, detect, sound, in, a, bi, directional, also, called, figure, eight, as, in, the, diagram, below, pattern, because, the, ribbon, is, open, on, both, sides, also, because, the, ribbon, has, much, less, mass, it, responds, to, the, air, velocity, rather, than, the, sound, pressure, though, the, symmetrical, front, and, rear, pickup, can, be, a, nuisance, in, normal, stereo, recording, the, high, side, rejection, can, be, used, to, advantage, by, positioning, a, ribbon, microphone, horizontally, for, example, above, cymbals, so, that, the, rear, lobe, picks, up, sound, only, from, the, cymbals, crossed, figure, 8, or, blumlein, pair, stereo, recording, is, gaining, in, popularity, and, the, figure, eight, response, of, a, ribbon, microphone, is, ideal, for, that, application, other, directional, patterns, are, produced, by, enclosing, one, side, of, the, ribbon, in, an, acoustic, trap, or, baffle, allowing, sound, to, reach, only, one, side, the, classic, rca, type, 77, dx, microphone, has, several, externally, adjustable, positions, of, the, internal, baffle, allowing, the, selection, of, several, response, patterns, ranging, from, figure, eight, to, unidirectional, such, older, ribbon, microphones, some, of, which, still, provide, high, quality, sound, reproduction, were, once, valued, for, this, reason, but, a, good, low, frequency, response, could, be, obtained, only, when, the, ribbon, was, suspended, very, loosely, which, made, them, relatively, fragile, modern, ribbon, materials, including, new, nanomaterials, have, now, been, introduced, that, eliminate, those, concerns, and, even, improve, the, effective, dynamic, range, of, ribbon, microphones, at, low, frequencies, protective, wind, screens, can, reduce, the, danger, of, damaging, a, vintage, ribbon, and, also, reduce, plosive, artifacts, in, the, recording, properly, designed, wind, screens, produce, negligible, treble, attenuation, in, common, with, other, classes, of, dynamic, microphone, ribbon, microphones, do, not, require, phantom, power, in, fact, this, voltage, can, damage, some, older, ribbon, microphones, some, new, modern, ribbon, microphone, designs, incorporate, a, preamplifier, and, therefore, do, require, phantom, power, and, circuits, of, modern, passive, ribbon, microphones, i, e, those, without, the, aforementioned, preamplifier, are, specifically, designed, to, resist, damage, to, the, ribbon, and, transformer, by, phantom, power, also, there, are, new, ribbon, materials, available, that, are, immune, to, wind, blasts, and, phantom, power, the, carbon, microphone, was, the, earliest, type, of, microphone, the, carbon, button, microphone, or, sometimes, just, a, button, microphone, uses, a, capsule, or, button, containing, carbon, granules, pressed, between, two, metal, plates, like, the, berliner, and, edison, microphones, a, voltage, is, applied, across, the, metal, plates, causing, a, small, current, to, flow, through, the, carbon, one, of, the, plates, the, diaphragm, vibrates, in, sympathy, with, incident, sound, waves, applying, a, varying, pressure, to, the, carbon, the, changing, pressure, deforms, the, granules, causing, the, contact, area, between, each, pair, of, adjacent, granules, to, change, and, this, causes, the, electrical, resistance, of, the, mass, of, granules, to, change, the, changes, in, resistance, cause, a, corresponding, change, in, the, current, flowing, through, the, microphone, producing, the, electrical, signal, carbon, microphones, were, once, commonly, used, in, telephones, they, have, extremely, low, quality, sound, reproduction, and, a, very, limited, frequency, response, range, but, are, very, robust, devices, the, boudet, microphone, which, used, relatively, large, carbon, balls, was, similar, to, the, granule, carbon, button, microphones, unlike, other, microphone, types, the, carbon, microphone, can, also, be, used, as, a, type, of, amplifier, using, a, small, amount, of, sound, energy, to, control, a, larger, amount, of, electrical, energy, carbon, microphones, found, use, as, early, telephone, repeaters, making, long, distance, phone, calls, possible, in, the, era, before, vacuum, tubes, called, a, brown, s, relay, these, repeaters, worked, by, mechanically, coupling, a, magnetic, telephone, receiver, to, a, carbon, microphone, the, faint, signal, from, the, receiver, was, transferred, to, the, microphone, where, it, modulated, a, stronger, electric, current, producing, a, stronger, electrical, signal, to, send, down, the, line, a, crystal, microphone, or, piezo, microphone, uses, the, phenomenon, of, piezoelectricity, the, ability, of, some, materials, to, produce, a, voltage, when, subjected, to, pressure, to, convert, vibrations, into, an, electrical, signal, an, example, of, this, is, potassium, sodium, tartrate, which, is, a, piezoelectric, crystal, that, works, as, a, transducer, both, as, a, microphone, and, as, a, slimline, loudspeaker, component, crystal, microphones, were, once, commonly, supplied, with, vacuum, tube, valve, equipment, such, as, domestic, tape, recorders, their, high, output, impedance, matched, the, high, input, impedance, typically, about, 10, m, of, the, vacuum, tube, input, stage, well, they, were, difficult, to, match, to, early, transistor, equipment, and, were, quickly, supplanted, by, dynamic, microphones, for, a, time, and, later, small, electret, condenser, devices, the, high, impedance, of, the, crystal, microphone, made, it, very, susceptible, to, handling, noise, both, from, the, microphone, itself, and, from, the, connecting, cable, piezoelectric, transducers, are, often, used, as, contact, microphones, to, amplify, sound, from, acoustic, musical, instruments, to, sense, drum, hits, for, triggering, electronic, samples, and, to, record, sound, in, challenging, environments, such, as, underwater, under, high, pressure, saddle, mounted, pickups, on, acoustic, guitars, are, generally, piezoelectric, devices, that, contact, the, strings, passing, over, the, saddle, this, type, of, microphone, is, different, from, magnetic, coil, pickups, commonly, visible, on, typical, electric, guitars, which, use, magnetic, induction, rather, than, mechanical, coupling, to, pick, up, vibration, a, fiber, optic, microphone, converts, acoustic, waves, into, electrical, signals, by, sensing, changes, in, light, intensity, instead, of, sensing, changes, in, capacitance, or, magnetic, fields, as, with, conventional, microphones, during, operation, light, from, a, laser, source, travels, through, an, optical, fiber, to, illuminate, the, surface, of, a, reflective, diaphragm, sound, vibrations, of, the, diaphragm, modulate, the, intensity, of, light, reflecting, off, the, diaphragm, in, a, specific, direction, the, modulated, light, is, then, transmitted, over, a, second, optical, fiber, to, a, photodetector, which, transforms, the, intensity, modulated, light, into, analog, or, digital, audio, for, transmission, or, recording, fiber, optic, microphones, possess, high, dynamic, and, frequency, range, similar, to, the, best, high, fidelity, conventional, microphones, fiber, optic, microphones, do, not, react, to, or, influence, any, electrical, magnetic, electrostatic, or, radioactive, fields, this, is, called, emi, rfi, immunity, the, fiber, optic, microphone, design, is, therefore, ideal, for, use, in, areas, where, conventional, microphones, are, ineffective, or, dangerous, such, as, inside, industrial, turbines, or, in, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, equipment, environments, fiber, optic, microphones, are, robust, resistant, to, environmental, changes, in, heat, and, moisture, and, can, be, produced, for, any, directionality, or, impedance, matching, the, distance, between, the, microphone, s, light, source, and, its, photodetector, may, be, up, to, several, kilometers, without, need, for, any, preamplifier, or, another, electrical, device, making, fiber, optic, microphones, suitable, for, industrial, and, surveillance, acoustic, monitoring, fiber, optic, microphones, are, used, in, very, specific, application, areas, such, as, for, infrasound, monitoring, and, noise, cancellation, they, have, proven, especially, useful, in, medical, applications, such, as, allowing, radiologists, staff, and, patients, within, the, powerful, and, noisy, magnetic, field, to, converse, normally, inside, the, mri, suites, as, well, as, in, remote, control, rooms, other, uses, include, industrial, equipment, monitoring, and, audio, calibration, and, measurement, high, fidelity, recording, and, law, enforcement, laser, microphones, are, often, portrayed, in, movies, as, spy, gadgets, because, they, can, be, used, to, pick, up, sound, at, a, distance, from, the, microphone, equipment, a, laser, beam, is, aimed, at, the, surface, of, a, window, or, other, plane, surface, that, is, affected, by, sound, the, vibrations, of, this, surface, change, the, angle, at, which, the, beam, is, reflected, and, the, motion, of, the, laser, spot, from, the, returning, beam, is, detected, and, converted, to, an, audio, signal, in, a, more, robust, and, expensive, implementation, the, returned, light, is, split, and, fed, to, an, interferometer, which, detects, movement, of, the, surface, by, changes, in, the, optical, path, length, of, the, reflected, beam, the, former, implementation, is, a, tabletop, experiment, the, latter, requires, an, extremely, stable, laser, and, precise, optics, a, new, type, of, laser, microphone, is, a, device, that, uses, a, laser, beam, and, smoke, or, vapor, to, detect, sound, vibrations, in, free, air, on, august, 25, 2009, u, s, patent, 7, 580, 533, issued, for, a, particulate, flow, detection, microphone, based, on, a, laser, photocell, pair, with, a, moving, stream, of, smoke, or, vapor, in, the, laser, beam, s, path, sound, pressure, waves, cause, disturbances, in, the, smoke, that, in, turn, cause, variations, in, the, amount, of, laser, light, reaching, the, photodetector, a, prototype, of, the, device, was, demonstrated, at, the, 127th, audio, engineering, society, convention, in, new, york, city, from, 9, through, october, 12, 2009, early, microphones, did, not, produce, intelligible, speech, until, alexander, graham, bell, made, improvements, including, a, variable, resistance, microphone, transmitter, bell, s, liquid, transmitter, consisted, of, a, metal, cup, filled, with, water, with, a, small, amount, of, sulfuric, acid, added, a, sound, wave, caused, the, diaphragm, to, move, forcing, a, needle, to, move, up, and, down, in, the, water, the, electrical, resistance, between, the, wire, and, the, cup, was, then, inversely, proportional, to, the, size, of, the, water, meniscus, around, the, submerged, needle, elisha, gray, filed, a, caveat, for, a, version, using, a, brass, rod, instead, of, the, needle, other, minor, variations, and, improvements, were, made, to, the, liquid, microphone, by, majoranna, chambers, vanni, sykes, and, elisha, gray, and, one, version, was, patented, by, reginald, fessenden, in, 1903, these, were, the, first, working, microphones, but, they, were, not, practical, for, commercial, application, the, famous, first, phone, conversation, between, bell, and, watson, took, place, using, a, liquid, microphone, the, mems, microelectromechanical, systems, microphone, is, also, called, a, microphone, chip, or, silicon, microphone, a, pressure, sensitive, diaphragm, is, etched, directly, into, a, silicon, wafer, by, mems, processing, techniques, and, is, usually, accompanied, with, an, integrated, preamplifier, most, mems, microphones, are, variants, of, the, condenser, microphone, design, digital, mems, microphones, have, built, in, analog, to, digital, converter, adc, circuits, on, the, same, cmos, chip, making, the, chip, a, digital, microphone, and, so, more, readily, integrated, with, modern, digital, products, major, manufacturers, producing, mems, silicon, microphones, are, wolfson, microelectronics, wm7xxx, now, cirrus, logic, invensense, product, line, sold, by, analog, devices, akustica, aku200x, infineon, smm310, product, knowles, electronics, memstech, msmx, nxp, semiconductors, division, bought, by, knowles, sonion, mems, vesper, aac, acoustic, technologies, and, omron, more, recently, since, the, 2010s, there, has, been, increased, interest, and, research, into, making, piezoelectric, mems, microphones, which, are, a, significant, architectural, and, material, change, from, existing, condenser, style, mems, designs, in, a, plasma, microphone, a, plasma, arc, of, ionized, gas, is, used, the, sound, waves, cause, variations, in, the, pressure, around, the, plasma, in, turn, causing, variations, in, temperature, which, alter, the, conductance, of, the, plasma, these, variations, in, conductance, can, be, picked, up, as, variations, superimposed, on, the, electrical, supply, to, the, plasma, this, is, an, experimental, form, of, microphone, a, loudspeaker, a, transducer, that, turns, an, electrical, signal, into, sound, waves, is, the, functional, opposite, of, a, microphone, since, a, conventional, speaker, is, similar, in, construction, to, a, dynamic, microphone, with, a, diaphragm, coil, and, magnet, speakers, can, actually, work, in, reverse, as, microphones, reciprocity, applies, so, the, resulting, microphone, has, the, same, impairments, as, a, single, driver, loudspeaker, limited, low, and, high, end, frequency, response, poorly, controlled, directivity, and, low, sensitivity, in, practical, use, speakers, are, sometimes, used, as, microphones, in, applications, where, high, bandwidth, and, sensitivity, are, not, needed, such, as, intercoms, walkie, talkies, or, video, game, voice, chat, peripherals, or, when, conventional, microphones, are, in, short, supply, however, there, is, at, least, one, practical, application, that, exploits, those, weaknesses, the, use, of, a, medium, size, woofer, placed, closely, in, front, of, a, kick, drum, bass, drum, in, a, drum, set, to, act, as, a, microphone, a, commercial, product, example, is, the, yamaha, subkick, a, 6, 5, inch, 170, mm, woofer, shock, mounted, into, a, 10, drum, shell, used, in, front, of, kick, drums, since, a, relatively, massive, membrane, is, unable, to, transduce, high, frequencies, while, being, capable, of, tolerating, strong, low, frequency, transients, the, speaker, is, often, ideal, for, picking, up, the, kick, drum, while, reducing, bleed, from, the, nearby, cymbals, and, snare, drums, the, inner, elements, of, a, microphone, are, the, primary, source, of, differences, in, directivity, a, pressure, microphone, uses, a, diaphragm, between, a, fixed, internal, volume, of, air, and, the, environment, and, responds, uniformly, to, pressure, from, all, directions, so, it, is, said, to, be, omnidirectional, a, pressure, gradient, microphone, uses, a, diaphragm, that, is, at, least, partially, open, on, both, sides, the, pressure, difference, between, the, two, sides, produces, its, directional, characteristics, other, elements, such, as, the, external, shape, of, the, microphone, and, external, devices, such, as, interference, tubes, can, also, alter, a, microphone, s, directional, response, a, pure, pressure, gradient, microphone, is, equally, sensitive, to, sounds, arriving, from, front, or, back, but, insensitive, to, sounds, arriving, from, the, side, because, sound, arriving, at, the, front, and, back, at, the, same, time, creates, no, gradient, between, the, two, the, characteristic, directional, pattern, of, a, pure, pressure, gradient, microphone, is, like, a, figure, 8, other, polar, patterns, are, derived, by, creating, a, capsule, that, combines, these, two, effects, in, different, ways, the, cardioid, for, instance, features, a, partially, closed, backside, so, its, response, is, a, combination, of, pressure, and, pressure, gradient, characteristics, a, microphone, s, directionality, or, polar, pattern, indicates, how, sensitive, it, is, to, sounds, arriving, at, different, angles, about, its, central, axis, the, polar, patterns, illustrated, above, represent, the, locus, of, points, in, polar, coordinates, that, produce, the, same, signal, level, output, in, the, microphone, if, a, given, sound, pressure, level, spl, is, generated, from, that, point, how, the, physical, body, of, the, microphone, is, oriented, relative, to, the, diagrams, depends, on, the, microphone, design, for, large, membrane, microphones, such, as, in, the, oktava, pictured, above, the, upward, direction, in, the, polar, diagram, is, usually, perpendicular, to, the, microphone, body, commonly, known, as, side, fire, or, side, address, for, small, diaphragm, microphones, such, as, the, shure, also, pictured, above, it, usually, extends, from, the, axis, of, the, microphone, commonly, known, as, end, fire, or, top, end, address, some, microphone, designs, combine, several, principles, in, creating, the, desired, polar, pattern, this, ranges, from, shielding, meaning, diffraction, dissipation, absorption, by, the, housing, itself, to, electronically, combining, dual, membranes, an, omnidirectional, or, nondirectional, microphone, s, response, is, generally, considered, to, be, a, perfect, sphere, in, three, dimensions, in, the, real, world, this, is, not, the, case, as, with, directional, microphones, the, polar, pattern, for, an, omnidirectional, microphone, is, a, function, of, frequency, the, body, of, the, microphone, is, not, infinitely, small, and, as, a, consequence, it, tends, to, get, in, its, own, way, with, respect, to, sounds, arriving, from, the, rear, causing, a, slight, flattening, of, the, polar, response, this, flattening, increases, as, the, diameter, of, the, microphone, assuming, it, s, cylindrical, reaches, the, wavelength, of, the, frequency, in, question, therefore, the, smallest, diameter, microphone, gives, the, best, omnidirectional, characteristics, at, high, frequencies, the, wavelength, of, sound, at, 10, khz, is, 1, 4, 3, 5, cm, the, smallest, measuring, microphones, are, often, 1, 4, 6, mm, in, diameter, which, practically, eliminates, directionality, even, up, to, the, highest, frequencies, omnidirectional, microphones, unlike, cardioids, do, not, employ, resonant, cavities, as, delays, and, so, can, be, considered, the, purest, microphones, in, terms, of, low, coloration, they, add, very, little, to, the, original, sound, being, pressure, sensitive, they, can, also, have, a, very, flat, low, frequency, response, down, to, 20, hz, or, below, pressure, sensitive, microphones, also, respond, much, less, to, wind, noise, and, plosives, than, directional, velocity, sensitive, microphones, areas, of, application, studios, old, churches, theaters, on, site, tv, interviews, etc, an, example, of, a, nondirectional, microphone, is, the, round, black, eight, ball, a, unidirectional, microphone, is, primarily, sensitive, to, sounds, from, only, one, direction, the, diagram, above, lobar, illustrates, a, number, of, these, patterns, the, microphone, faces, upwards, in, each, diagram, the, sound, intensity, for, a, particular, frequency, is, plotted, for, angles, radially, from, 0, to, 360, professional, diagrams, show, these, scales, and, include, multiple, plots, at, different, frequencies, the, diagrams, given, here, provide, only, an, overview, of, typical, pattern, shapes, and, their, names, the, most, common, unidirectional, microphone, is, a, cardioid, microphone, so, named, because, the, sensitivity, pattern, is, heart, shaped, i, e, a, cardioid, the, cardioid, family, of, microphones, are, commonly, used, as, vocal, or, speech, microphones, since, they, are, good, at, rejecting, sounds, from, other, directions, in, three, dimensions, the, cardioid, is, shaped, like, an, apple, centered, around, the, microphone, which, is, the, stem, of, the, apple, the, cardioid, response, reduces, pickup, from, the, side, and, rear, helping, to, avoid, feedback, from, the, monitors, since, these, directional, transducer, microphones, achieve, their, patterns, by, sensing, pressure, gradient, putting, them, very, close, to, the, sound, source, at, distances, of, a, few, centimeters, results, in, a, bass, boost, due, to, the, increased, gradient, this, is, known, as, the, proximity, effect, the, sm58, has, been, the, most, commonly, used, microphone, for, live, vocals, for, more, than, 50, years, demonstrating, the, importance, and, popularity, of, cardioid, mics, the, cardioid, is, effectively, a, superposition, of, an, omnidirectional, pressure, and, a, figure, 8, pressure, gradient, microphone, for, sound, waves, coming, from, the, back, the, negative, signal, from, the, figure, 8, cancels, the, positive, signal, from, the, omnidirectional, element, whereas, for, sound, waves, coming, from, the, front, the, two, add, to, each, other, however, in, low, frequencies, a, cardioid, microphone, behaves, as, an, omnidirectional, microphone, by, combining, the, two, components, in, different, ratios, any, pattern, between, omni, and, figure, 8, can, be, achieved, which, comprise, the, first, order, cardioid, family, common, shapes, include, three, such, cardioid, microphones, hydrophones, could, be, orthogonally, oriented, as, a, collocated, triad, to, improve, the, gain, and, also, create, a, steerable, beam, pattern, figure, 8, or, bi, directional, microphones, receive, sound, equally, from, both, the, front, and, back, of, the, element, most, ribbon, microphones, are, of, this, pattern, in, principle, they, do, not, respond, to, sound, pressure, at, all, only, to, the, change, in, pressure, between, front, and, back, since, sound, arriving, from, the, side, reaches, front, and, back, equally, there, is, no, difference, in, pressure, and, therefore, no, sensitivity, to, sound, from, that, direction, in, more, mathematical, terms, while, omnidirectional, microphones, are, scalar, transducers, responding, to, pressure, from, any, direction, bi, directional, microphones, are, vector, transducers, responding, to, the, gradient, along, an, axis, normal, to, the, plane, of, the, diaphragm, this, also, has, the, effect, of, inverting, the, output, polarity, for, sounds, arriving, from, the, back, side, shotgun, microphones, are, the, most, highly, directional, of, simple, first, order, unidirectional, types, at, low, frequencies, they, have, the, classic, polar, response, of, a, hypercardioid, while, at, medium, and, higher, frequencies, an, interference, tube, gives, them, an, increased, forward, response, this, is, achieved, by, a, process, of, cancellation, of, off, axis, waves, entering, the, longitudinal, array, of, slots, a, consequence, of, this, technique, is, the, presence, of, some, rear, lobes, that, vary, in, level, and, angle, with, frequency, and, can, cause, some, coloration, effects, several, approaches, have, been, developed, for, effectively, using, a, microphone, in, less, than, ideal, acoustic, spaces, which, often, suffer, from, excessive, reflections, from, one, or, more, of, the, surfaces, boundaries, that, make, up, the, space, if, the, microphone, is, placed, in, or, very, close, to, one, of, these, boundaries, the, reflections, from, that, surface, have, the, same, timing, as, the, direct, sound, thus, giving, the, microphone, a, hemispherical, polar, pattern, and, improved, intelligibility, initially, this, was, done, by, placing, an, ordinary, microphone, adjacent, to, the, surface, sometimes, in, a, block, of, acoustically, transparent, foam, sound, engineers, ed, long, and, ron, wickersham, developed, the, concept, of, placing, the, diaphragm, parallel, to, and, facing, the, boundary, while, the, patent, has, expired, pressure, zone, microphone, and, pzm, are, still, active, trademarks, of, crown, international, while, a, boundary, microphone, was, initially, implemented, using, an, omnidirectional, element, it, is, also, possible, to, mount, a, directional, microphone, close, enough, to, the, surface, to, gain, some, of, the, benefits, of, this, technique, while, retaining, the, directional, properties, of, the, element, crown, s, trademark, on, this, approach, is, phase, coherent, cardioid, or, pcc, but, there, are, other, makers, who, employ, this, technique, as, well, a, lavalier, microphone, is, made, for, hands, free, operation, these, small, microphones, are, worn, on, the, body, originally, they, were, held, in, place, with, a, lanyard, worn, around, the, neck, but, more, often, they, are, fastened, to, clothing, with, a, clip, pin, tape, or, magnet, the, lavalier, cord, may, be, hidden, by, clothes, and, either, run, to, an, rf, transmitter, in, a, pocket, or, clipped, to, a, belt, for, mobile, use, or, run, directly, to, the, mixer, for, stationary, applications, a, wireless, microphone, transmits, the, audio, as, a, radio, or, optical, signal, rather, than, via, a, cable, it, usually, sends, its, signal, using, a, small, radio, transmitter, to, a, nearby, receiver, connected, to, the, sound, system, but, it, can, also, use, infrared, waves, if, the, transmitter, and, receiver, are, within, sight, of, each, other, a, contact, microphone, picks, up, vibrations, directly, from, a, solid, surface, or, object, as, opposed, to, sound, vibrations, carried, through, air, one, use, for, this, is, to, detect, sounds, of, a, very, low, level, such, as, those, from, small, objects, or, insects, the, microphone, commonly, consists, of, a, magnetic, moving, coil, transducer, contact, plate, and, contact, pin, the, contact, plate, is, placed, directly, on, the, vibrating, part, of, a, musical, instrument, or, other, surface, and, the, contact, pin, transfers, vibrations, to, the, coil, contact, microphones, have, been, used, to, pick, up, the, sound, of, a, snail, s, heartbeat, and, the, footsteps, of, ants, a, portable, version, of, this, microphone, has, recently, been, developed, a, throat, microphone, is, a, variant, of, the, contact, microphone, that, picks, up, speech, directly, from, a, person, s, throat, which, it, is, strapped, to, this, lets, the, device, be, used, in, areas, with, ambient, sounds, that, would, otherwise, make, the, speaker, inaudible, a, parabolic, microphone, uses, a, parabolic, reflector, to, collect, and, focus, sound, waves, onto, a, microphone, receiver, in, much, the, same, way, that, a, parabolic, antenna, e, g, satellite, dish, does, with, radio, waves, typical, uses, of, this, microphone, which, has, unusually, focused, front, sensitivity, and, can, pick, up, sounds, from, many, meters, away, include, nature, recording, outdoor, sporting, events, eavesdropping, law, enforcement, and, even, espionage, parabolic, microphones, are, not, typically, used, for, standard, recording, applications, because, they, tend, to, have, a, poor, low, frequency, response, as, a, side, effect, of, their, design, a, stereo, microphone, integrates, two, microphones, in, one, unit, to, produce, a, stereophonic, signal, a, stereo, microphone, is, often, used, for, broadcast, applications, or, field, recording, where, it, would, be, impractical, to, configure, two, separate, condenser, microphones, in, a, classic, x, y, configuration, see, microphone, practice, for, stereophonic, recording, some, such, microphones, have, an, adjustable, angle, of, coverage, between, the, two, channels, a, noise, canceling, microphone, is, a, highly, directional, design, intended, for, noisy, environments, one, such, use, is, in, aircraft, cockpits, where, they, are, normally, installed, as, boom, microphones, on, headsets, another, use, is, in, live, event, support, on, loud, concert, stages, for, vocalists, involved, with, live, performances, many, noise, canceling, microphones, combine, signals, received, from, two, diaphragms, that, are, in, opposite, electrical, polarity, or, are, processed, electronically, in, dual, diaphragm, designs, the, main, diaphragm, is, mounted, closest, to, the, intended, source, and, the, second, is, positioned, farther, away, from, the, source, so, that, it, can, pick, up, environmental, sounds, to, be, subtracted, from, the, main, diaphragm, s, signal, after, the, two, signals, have, been, combined, sounds, other, than, the, intended, source, are, greatly, reduced, substantially, increasing, intelligibility, other, noise, canceling, designs, use, one, diaphragm, that, is, affected, by, ports, open, to, the, sides, and, rear, of, the, microphone, with, the, sum, being, a, 16, db, rejection, of, sounds, that, are, farther, away, one, noise, canceling, headset, design, using, a, single, diaphragm, has, been, used, prominently, by, vocal, artists, such, as, garth, brooks, and, janet, jackson, a, few, noise, canceling, microphones, are, throat, microphones, various, standard, techniques, are, used, with, microphones, used, in, sound, reinforcement, at, live, performances, or, for, recording, in, a, studio, or, on, a, motion, picture, set, by, suitable, arrangement, of, one, or, more, microphones, desirable, features, of, the, sound, to, be, collected, can, be, kept, while, rejecting, unwanted, sounds, microphones, containing, active, circuitry, such, as, most, condenser, microphones, require, power, to, operate, the, active, components, the, first, of, these, used, vacuum, tube, circuits, with, a, separate, power, supply, unit, using, a, multi, pin, cable, and, connector, with, the, advent, of, solid, state, amplification, the, power, requirements, were, greatly, reduced, and, it, became, practical, to, use, the, same, cable, conductors, and, connector, for, audio, and, power, during, the, 1960s, several, powering, methods, were, developed, mainly, in, europe, the, two, dominant, methods, were, initially, defined, in, german, din, 45595, as, tonaderspeisung, or, t, power, and, din, 45596, for, phantom, power, since, the, 1980s, phantom, power, has, become, much, more, common, because, the, same, input, may, be, used, for, both, powered, and, unpowered, microphones, in, consumer, electronics, such, as, dslrs, and, camcorders, plug, in, power, is, more, common, for, microphones, using, a, 3, 5, mm, phone, plug, connector, phantom, t, power, and, plug, in, power, are, described, in, international, standard, iec, 61938, the, most, common, connectors, used, by, microphones, are, some, microphones, use, other, connectors, such, as, a, 5, pin, xlr, or, mini, xlr, for, connection, to, portable, equipment, some, lavalier, or, lapel, from, the, days, of, attaching, the, microphone, to, the, news, reporter, s, suit, lapel, microphones, use, a, proprietary, connector, for, connection, to, a, wireless, transmitter, such, as, a, radio, pack, since, 2005, professional, quality, microphones, with, usb, connections, have, begun, to, appear, designed, for, direct, recording, into, computer, based, software, when, choosing, a, pre, amplifier, for, a, certain, microphone, the, microphone, s, impedance, must, be, known, impedance, is, a, frequency, dependent, electrical, characteristic, measured, in, ohms, that, relates, voltage, to, current, when, not, concerned, with, power, transfer, signals, are, generally, transferred, as, varying, voltages, and, this, is, also, the, case, for, microphones, to, obtain, the, highest, signal, amplitude, one, uses, a, method, called, impedance, bridging, in, this, configuration, the, output, impedance, of, the, microphone, should, be, negligible, in, comparison, with, the, input, impedance, of, the, pre, amplifier, in, practice, a, pre, amp, impedance, at, least, 10, times, greater, than, the, microphone, impedance, is, recommended, by, doing, so, the, signal, is, attenuated, minimally, and, almost, no, power, is, used, in, the, process, the, main, alternative, to, impedance, bridging, is, impedance, matching, which, maximizes, power, transfer, for, a, given, source, impedance, however, this, has, not, been, relevant, since, the, early, 20th, century, when, amplifiers, were, very, expensive, and, produced, a, lot, of, heat, to, reduce, the, number, of, amplifiers, in, telephone, lines, power, loss, needed, to, be, minimal, so, source, and, load, impedances, were, matched, a, downside, to, impedance, matching, is, the, 6, db, loss, in, signal, that, occurs, as, only, half, the, voltage, level, appears, at, the, pre, amplifier, s, input, certain, ribbon, and, dynamic, microphones, however, are, exceptions, due, to, the, designers, assumption, of, a, certain, load, impedance, being, part, of, the, internal, electro, acoustical, damping, circuit, of, the, microphone, different, microphones, can, have, vastly, different, impedances, and, this, depends, on, the, design, in, passive, microphones, this, value, relates, closely, to, the, impedance, of, the, coil, or, similar, mechanism, in, active, microphones, this, value, describes, the, output, impedance, of, its, internal, amplifier, circuitry, low, impedance, is, considered, under, 600, medium, impedance, is, considered, between, 600, and, 10, k, high, impedance, is, above, 10, k, owing, to, their, built, in, amplifier, condenser, microphones, typically, have, an, output, impedance, between, 50, and, 200, the, aes42, standard, published, by, the, audio, engineering, society, defines, a, digital, interface, for, microphones, microphones, conforming, to, this, standard, directly, output, a, digital, audio, stream, through, an, xlr, or, xld, male, connector, rather, than, producing, an, analog, output, digital, microphones, may, be, used, either, with, new, equipment, with, appropriate, input, connections, that, conform, to, the, aes42, standard, or, else, via, a, suitable, interface, box, studio, quality, microphones, that, operate, in, accordance, with, the, aes42, standard, are, now, available, from, a, number, of, microphone, manufacturers, because, of, differences, in, their, construction, microphones, have, their, own, characteristic, responses, to, sound, this, difference, in, response, produces, non, uniform, phase, and, frequency, responses, additionally, microphones, are, not, uniformly, sensitive, to, sound, pressure, and, can, accept, differing, levels, without, distorting, although, for, scientific, applications, microphones, with, a, more, uniform, response, are, desirable, this, is, often, not, the, case, for, music, recording, as, the, non, uniform, response, of, a, microphone, can, produce, a, desirable, coloration, of, the, sound, there, is, an, international, standard, for, microphone, specifications, but, few, manufacturers, adhere, to, it, as, a, result, comparison, of, published, data, from, different, manufacturers, is, difficult, because, different, measurement, techniques, are, used, caution, should, be, used, in, drawing, any, solid, conclusions, from, this, or, any, other, published, data, however, unless, it, is, known, that, the, manufacturer, has, supplied, specifications, in, accordance, with, iec, 60268, 4, a, frequency, response, diagram, plots, the, microphone, sensitivity, in, decibels, over, a, range, of, frequencies, typically, 20, hz, to, 20, khz, generally, for, perfectly, on, axis, sound, sound, arriving, at, 0, to, the, capsule, frequency, response, may, be, less, informatively, stated, textually, like, so, 30, hz, 16, khz, 3, db, this, is, interpreted, as, meaning, a, nearly, flat, linear, plot, between, the, stated, frequencies, with, variations, in, amplitude, of, no, more, than, plus, or, minus, 3, db, however, one, cannot, determine, from, this, information, how, smooth, the, variations, are, nor, in, what, parts, of, the, spectrum, they, occur, note, that, commonly, made, statements, such, as, 20, hz, 20, khz, are, meaningless, without, a, decibel, measure, of, tolerance, directional, microphones, frequency, response, varies, greatly, with, distance, from, the, sound, source, and, with, the, geometry, of, the, sound, source, iec, 60268, 4, specifies, that, frequency, response, should, be, measured, in, plane, progressive, wave, conditions, very, far, away, from, the, source, but, this, is, seldom, practical, close, talking, microphones, may, be, measured, with, different, sound, sources, and, distances, but, there, is, no, standard, and, therefore, no, way, to, compare, data, from, different, models, unless, the, measurement, technique, is, described, the, self, noise, or, equivalent, input, noise, level, is, the, sound, level, that, creates, the, same, output, voltage, as, the, microphone, does, in, the, absence, of, sound, this, represents, the, lowest, point, of, the, microphone, s, dynamic, range, and, is, particularly, important, should, you, wish, to, record, sounds, that, are, quiet, the, measure, is, often, stated, in, db, a, which, is, the, equivalent, loudness, of, the, noise, on, a, decibel, scale, frequency, weighted, for, how, the, ear, hears, for, example, 15, dba, spl, spl, means, sound, pressure, level, relative, to, 20, micropascals, the, lower, the, number, the, better, some, microphone, manufacturers, state, the, noise, level, using, itu, r, 468, noise, weighting, which, more, accurately, represents, the, way, we, hear, noise, but, gives, a, figure, some, 11, 14, db, higher, a, quiet, microphone, typically, measures, 20, dba, spl, or, 32, db, spl, 468, weighted, very, quiet, microphones, have, existed, for, years, for, special, applications, such, the, br, el, kjaer, 4179, with, a, noise, level, around, 0, db, spl, recently, some, microphones, with, low, noise, specifications, have, been, introduced, in, the, studio, entertainment, market, such, as, models, from, neumann, and, r, de, that, advertise, noise, levels, between, 5, 7, dba, typically, this, is, achieved, by, altering, the, frequency, response, of, the, capsule, and, electronics, to, result, in, lower, noise, within, the, a, weighting, curve, while, broadband, noise, may, be, increased, the, clipping, level, is, an, important, indicator, of, maximum, usable, level, as, the, 1, total, harmonic, distortion, thd, figure, usually, quoted, under, max, spl, is, really, a, very, mild, level, of, distortion, quite, inaudible, especially, on, brief, high, peaks, clipping, is, much, more, audible, for, some, microphones, the, clipping, level, may, be, much, higher, than, the, max, spl, the, dynamic, range, of, a, microphone, is, the, difference, in, spl, between, the, noise, floor, and, the, maximum, spl, if, stated, on, its, own, for, example, 120, db, it, conveys, significantly, less, information, than, having, the, self, noise, and, maximum, spl, figures, individually, sensitivity, indicates, how, well, the, microphone, converts, acoustic, pressure, to, an, output, voltage, a, high, sensitivity, microphone, creates, more, voltage, and, so, needs, less, amplification, at, the, mixer, or, recording, device, this, is, a, practical, concern, but, is, not, directly, an, indication, of, the, microphone, s, quality, and, in, fact, the, term, sensitivity, is, something, of, a, misnomer, transduction, gain, being, perhaps, more, meaningful, or, just, output, level, because, true, sensitivity, is, generally, set, by, the, noise, floor, and, too, much, sensitivity, in, terms, of, output, level, compromises, the, clipping, level, there, are, two, common, measures, the, preferred, international, standard, is, made, in, millivolts, per, pascal, at, 1, khz, a, higher, value, indicates, greater, sensitivity, the, older, american, method, is, referred, to, a, 1, v, pa, standard, and, measured, in, plain, decibels, resulting, in, a, negative, value, again, a, higher, value, indicates, greater, sensitivity, so, 60, db, is, more, sensitive, than, 70, db, some, microphones, are, intended, for, testing, speakers, measuring, noise, levels, and, otherwise, quantifying, an, acoustic, experience, these, are, calibrated, transducers, and, are, usually, supplied, with, a, calibration, certificate, that, states, absolute, sensitivity, against, frequency, the, quality, of, measurement, microphones, is, often, referred, to, using, the, designations, class, 1, type, 2, etc, which, are, references, not, to, microphone, specifications, but, to, sound, level, meters, a, more, comprehensive, standard, for, the, description, of, measurement, microphone, performance, was, recently, adopted, measurement, microphones, are, generally, scalar, sensors, of, pressure, they, exhibit, an, omnidirectional, response, limited, only, by, the, scattering, profile, of, their, physical, dimensions, sound, intensity, or, sound, power, measurements, require, pressure, gradient, measurements, which, are, typically, made, using, arrays, of, at, least, two, microphones, or, with, hot, wire, anemometers, to, take, a, scientific, measurement, with, a, microphone, its, precise, sensitivity, must, be, known, in, volts, per, pascal, since, this, may, change, over, the, lifetime, of, the, device, it, is, necessary, to, regularly, calibrate, measurement, microphones, this, service, is, offered, by, some, microphone, manufacturers, and, by, independent, certified, testing, labs, all, microphone, calibration, is, ultimately, traceable, to, primary, standards, at, a, national, measurement, institute, such, as, npl, in, the, uk, ptb, in, germany, and, nist, in, the, united, states, which, most, commonly, calibrate, using, the, reciprocity, primary, standard, measurement, microphones, calibrated, using, this, method, can, then, be, used, to, calibrate, other, microphones, using, comparison, calibration, techniques, depending, on, the, application, measurement, microphones, must, be, tested, periodically, every, year, or, several, months, typically, and, after, any, potentially, damaging, event, such, as, being, dropped, most, such, microphones, come, in, foam, padded, cases, to, reduce, this, risk, or, exposed, to, sounds, beyond, the, acceptable, level, a, microphone, array, is, any, number, of, microphones, operating, in, tandem, there, are, many, applications, typically, an, array, is, made, up, of, omnidirectional, microphones, distributed, about, the, perimeter, of, a, space, linked, to, a, computer, that, records, and, interprets, the, results, into, a, coherent, form, windscreens, or, windshields, the, terms, are, interchangeable, provide, a, method, of, reducing, the, effect, of, wind, on, microphones, while, pop, screens, give, protection, from, unidirectional, blasts, foam, hats, shield, wind, into, the, grille, from, all, directions, and, blimps, zeppelins, and, baskets, entirely, enclose, the, microphone, and, protect, its, body, as, well, the, latter, is, important, because, given, the, extreme, low, frequency, content, of, wind, noise, vibration, induced, in, the, housing, of, the, microphone, can, contribute, substantially, to, the, noise, output, the, shielding, material, used, wire, gauze, fabric, or, foam, is, designed, to, have, a, significant, acoustic, impedance, the, relatively, low, particle, velocity, air, pressure, changes, that, constitute, sound, waves, can, pass, through, with, minimal, attenuation, but, higher, particle, velocity, wind, is, impeded, to, a, far, greater, extent, increasing, the, thickness, of, the, material, improves, wind, attenuation, but, also, begins, to, compromise, high, frequency, audio, content, this, limits, the, practical, size, of, simple, foam, screens, while, foams, and, wire, meshes, can, be, partly, or, wholly, self, supporting, soft, fabrics, and, gauzes, require, stretching, on, frames, or, laminating, with, coarser, structural, elements, since, all, wind, noise, is, generated, at, the, first, surface, the, air, hits, the, greater, the, spacing, between, the, shield, periphery, and, microphone, capsule, the, greater, the, noise, attenuation, for, an, approximately, spherical, shield, attenuation, increases, by, approximately, the, cube, of, that, distance, with, full, basket, windshields, there, is, an, additional, pressure, chamber, effect, first, explained, by, joerg, wuttke, which, for, two, port, pressure, gradient, microphones, allows, the, shield, and, microphone, combination, to, act, as, a, high, pass, acoustic, filter, since, turbulence, at, a, surface, is, the, source, of, wind, noise, reducing, gross, turbulence, can, add, to, noise, reduction, both, aerodynamically, smooth, surfaces, and, ones, that, prevent, powerful, vortices, being, generated, have, been, used, successfully, historically, artificial, fur, has, proved, very, useful, for, this, purpose, since, the, fibers, produce, micro, turbulence, and, absorb, energy, silently, if, not, matted, by, wind, and, rain, the, fur, fibers, are, very, transparent, acoustically, but, the, woven, or, knitted, backing, can, give, significant, attenuation, as, a, material, it, suffers, from, being, difficult, to, manufacture, with, consistency, and, is, hard, to, keep, in, pristine, condition, on, location, thus, there, is, an, interest, in, moving, away, from, its, use
