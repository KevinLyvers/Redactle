heat, treating, or, heat, treatment, is, a, group, of, industrial, thermal, and, metalworking, processes, used, to, alter, the, physical, and, sometimes, chemical, properties, of, a, material, the, most, common, application, is, metallurgical, heat, treatments, are, also, used, in, the, manufacture, of, many, other, materials, such, as, glass, heat, treatment, involves, the, use, of, heating, or, chilling, normally, to, extreme, temperatures, to, achieve, the, desired, result, such, as, hardening, or, softening, of, a, material, heat, treatment, techniques, include, annealing, case, hardening, precipitation, strengthening, tempering, carburizing, normalizing, and, quenching, although, the, term, heat, treatment, applies, only, to, processes, where, the, heating, and, cooling, are, done, for, the, specific, purpose, of, altering, properties, intentionally, heating, and, cooling, often, occur, incidentally, during, other, manufacturing, processes, such, as, hot, forming, or, welding, metallic, materials, consist, of, a, microstructure, of, small, crystals, called, grains, or, crystallites, the, nature, of, the, grains, i, e, grain, size, and, composition, is, one, of, the, most, effective, factors, that, can, determine, the, overall, mechanical, behavior, of, the, metal, heat, treatment, provides, an, efficient, way, to, manipulate, the, properties, of, the, metal, by, controlling, the, rate, of, diffusion, and, the, rate, of, cooling, within, the, microstructure, heat, treating, is, often, used, to, alter, the, mechanical, properties, of, a, metallic, alloy, manipulating, properties, such, as, the, hardness, strength, toughness, ductility, and, elasticity, there, are, two, mechanisms, that, may, change, an, alloy, s, properties, during, heat, treatment, the, formation, of, martensite, causes, the, crystals, to, deform, intrinsically, and, the, diffusion, mechanism, causes, changes, in, the, homogeneity, of, the, alloy, the, crystal, structure, consists, of, atoms, that, are, grouped, in, a, very, specific, arrangement, called, a, lattice, in, most, elements, this, order, will, rearrange, itself, depending, on, conditions, like, temperature, and, pressure, this, rearrangement, called, allotropy, or, polymorphism, may, occur, several, times, at, many, different, temperatures, for, a, particular, metal, in, alloys, this, rearrangement, may, cause, an, element, that, will, not, normally, dissolve, into, the, base, metal, to, suddenly, become, soluble, while, a, reversal, of, the, allotropy, will, make, the, elements, either, partially, or, completely, insoluble, when, in, the, soluble, state, the, process, of, diffusion, causes, the, atoms, of, the, dissolved, element, to, spread, out, attempting, to, form, a, homogenous, distribution, within, the, crystals, of, the, base, metal, if, the, alloy, is, cooled, to, an, insoluble, state, the, atoms, of, the, dissolved, constituents, solutes, may, migrate, out, of, the, solution, this, type, of, diffusion, called, precipitation, leads, to, nucleation, where, the, migrating, atoms, group, together, at, the, grain, boundaries, this, forms, a, microstructure, generally, consisting, of, two, or, more, distinct, phases, for, instance, steel, that, has, been, heated, above, the, austenizing, temperature, red, to, orange, hot, or, around, 1, 500, f, 820, c, to, 1, 600, f, 870, c, depending, on, carbon, content, and, then, cooled, slowly, forms, a, laminated, structure, composed, of, alternating, layers, of, ferrite, and, cementite, becoming, soft, pearlite, after, heating, the, steel, to, the, austenite, phase, and, then, quenching, it, in, water, the, microstructure, will, be, in, the, martensitic, phase, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, the, steel, will, change, from, the, austenite, phase, to, the, martensite, phase, after, quenching, some, pearlite, or, ferrite, may, be, present, if, the, quench, did, not, rapidly, cool, off, all, the, steel, unlike, iron, based, alloys, most, heat, treatable, alloys, do, not, experience, a, ferrite, transformation, in, these, alloys, the, nucleation, at, the, grain, boundaries, often, reinforces, the, structure, of, the, crystal, matrix, these, metals, harden, by, precipitation, typically, a, slow, process, depending, on, temperature, this, is, often, referred, to, as, age, hardening, many, metals, and, non, metals, exhibit, a, martensite, transformation, when, cooled, quickly, with, external, media, like, oil, polymer, water, etc, when, a, metal, is, cooled, very, quickly, the, insoluble, atoms, may, not, be, able, to, migrate, out, of, the, solution, in, time, this, is, called, a, diffusionless, transformation, when, the, crystal, matrix, changes, to, its, low, temperature, arrangement, the, atoms, of, the, solute, become, trapped, within, the, lattice, the, trapped, atoms, prevent, the, crystal, matrix, from, completely, changing, into, its, low, temperature, allotrope, creating, shearing, stresses, within, the, lattice, when, some, alloys, are, cooled, quickly, such, as, steel, the, martensite, transformation, hardens, the, metal, while, in, others, like, aluminum, the, alloy, becomes, softer, the, specific, composition, of, an, alloy, system, will, usually, have, a, great, effect, on, the, results, of, heat, treating, if, the, percentage, of, each, constituent, is, just, right, the, alloy, will, form, a, single, continuous, microstructure, upon, cooling, such, a, mixture, is, said, to, be, eutectoid, however, if, the, percentage, of, the, solutes, varies, from, the, eutectoid, mixture, two, or, more, different, microstructures, will, usually, form, simultaneously, a, hypo, eutectoid, solution, contains, less, of, the, solute, than, the, eutectoid, mix, while, a, hypereutectoid, solution, contains, more, a, eutectoid, eutectic, like, alloy, is, similar, in, behavior, to, a, eutectic, alloy, a, eutectic, alloy, is, characterized, by, having, a, single, melting, point, this, melting, point, is, lower, than, that, of, any, of, the, constituents, and, no, change, in, the, mixture, will, lower, the, melting, point, any, further, when, a, molten, eutectic, alloy, is, cooled, all, of, the, constituents, will, crystallize, into, their, respective, phases, at, the, same, temperature, a, eutectoid, alloy, is, similar, but, the, phase, change, occurs, not, from, a, liquid, but, from, a, solid, solution, upon, cooling, a, eutectoid, alloy, from, the, solution, temperature, the, constituents, will, separate, into, different, crystal, phases, forming, a, single, microstructure, a, eutectoid, steel, for, example, contains, 0, 77, carbon, upon, cooling, slowly, the, solution, of, iron, and, carbon, a, single, phase, called, austenite, will, separate, into, platelets, of, the, phases, ferrite, and, cementite, this, forms, a, layered, microstructure, called, pearlite, since, pearlite, is, harder, than, iron, the, degree, of, softness, achievable, is, typically, limited, to, that, produced, by, the, pearlite, similarly, the, hardenability, is, limited, by, the, continuous, martensitic, microstructure, formed, when, cooled, very, fast, a, hypoeutectic, alloy, has, two, separate, melting, points, both, are, above, the, eutectic, melting, point, for, the, system, but, are, below, the, melting, points, of, any, constituent, forming, the, system, between, these, two, melting, points, the, alloy, will, exist, as, part, solid, and, part, liquid, the, constituent, with, the, higher, melting, point, will, solidify, first, when, completely, solidified, a, hypoeutectic, alloy, will, often, be, in, a, solid, solution, similarly, a, hypoeutectoid, alloy, has, two, critical, temperatures, called, arrests, between, these, two, temperatures, the, alloy, will, exist, partly, as, the, solution, and, partly, as, a, separate, crystallizing, phase, called, the, pro, eutectoid, phase, these, two, temperatures, are, called, the, upper, a, 3, and, lower, a, 1, transformation, temperatures, as, the, solution, cools, from, the, upper, transformation, temperature, toward, an, insoluble, state, the, excess, base, metal, will, often, be, forced, to, crystallize, out, becoming, the, pro, eutectoid, this, will, occur, until, the, remaining, concentration, of, solutes, reaches, the, eutectoid, level, which, will, then, crystallize, as, a, separate, microstructure, for, example, a, hypoeutectoid, steel, contains, less, than, 0, 77, carbon, upon, cooling, a, hypoeutectoid, steel, from, the, austenite, transformation, temperature, small, islands, of, proeutectoid, ferrite, will, form, these, will, continue, to, grow, and, the, carbon, will, recede, until, the, eutectoid, concentration, in, the, rest, of, the, steel, is, reached, this, eutectoid, mixture, will, then, crystallize, as, a, microstructure, of, pearlite, since, ferrite, is, softer, than, pearlite, the, two, microstructures, combine, to, increase, the, ductility, of, the, alloy, consequently, the, hardenability, of, the, alloy, is, lowered, a, hypereutectic, alloy, also, has, different, melting, points, however, between, these, points, it, is, the, constituent, with, the, higher, melting, point, that, will, be, solid, similarly, a, hypereutectoid, alloy, has, two, critical, temperatures, when, cooling, a, hypereutectoid, alloy, from, the, upper, transformation, temperature, it, will, usually, be, the, excess, solutes, that, crystallize, out, first, forming, the, pro, eutectoid, this, continues, until, the, concentration, in, the, remaining, alloy, becomes, eutectoid, which, then, crystallizes, into, a, separate, microstructure, a, hypereutectoid, steel, contains, more, than, 0, 77, carbon, when, slowly, cooling, hypereutectoid, steel, the, cementite, will, begin, to, crystallize, first, when, the, remaining, steel, becomes, eutectoid, in, composition, it, will, crystallize, into, pearlite, since, cementite, is, much, harder, than, pearlite, the, alloy, has, greater, hardenability, at, a, cost, in, ductility, proper, heat, treating, requires, precise, control, over, temperature, time, held, at, a, certain, temperature, and, cooling, rate, with, the, exception, of, stress, relieving, tempering, and, aging, most, heat, treatments, begin, by, heating, an, alloy, beyond, a, certain, transformation, or, arrest, a, temperature, this, temperature, is, referred, to, as, an, arrest, because, at, the, a, temperature, the, metal, experiences, a, period, of, hysteresis, at, this, point, all, of, the, heat, energy, is, used, to, cause, the, crystal, change, so, the, temperature, stops, rising, for, a, short, time, arrests, and, then, continues, climbing, once, the, change, is, complete, therefore, the, alloy, must, be, heated, above, the, critical, temperature, for, a, transformation, to, occur, the, alloy, will, usually, be, held, at, this, temperature, long, enough, for, the, heat, to, completely, penetrate, the, alloy, thereby, bringing, it, into, a, complete, solid, solution, iron, for, example, has, four, critical, temperatures, depending, on, carbon, content, pure, iron, in, its, alpha, room, temperature, state, changes, to, nonmagnetic, gamma, iron, at, its, a, 2, temperature, and, weldable, delta, iron, at, its, a, 4, temperature, however, as, carbon, is, added, becoming, steel, the, a, 2, temperature, splits, into, the, a, 3, temperature, also, called, the, austenizing, temperature, all, phases, become, austenite, a, solution, of, gamma, iron, and, carbon, and, its, a, 1, temperature, austenite, changes, into, pearlite, upon, cooling, between, these, upper, and, lower, temperatures, the, pro, eutectoid, phase, forms, upon, cooling, because, a, smaller, grain, size, usually, enhances, mechanical, properties, such, as, toughness, shear, strength, and, tensile, strength, these, metals, are, often, heated, to, a, temperature, that, is, just, above, the, upper, critical, temperature, in, order, to, prevent, the, grains, of, solution, from, growing, too, large, for, instance, when, steel, is, heated, above, the, upper, critical, temperature, small, grains, of, austenite, form, these, grow, larger, as, the, temperature, is, increased, when, cooled, very, quickly, during, a, martensite, transformation, the, austenite, grain, size, directly, affects, the, martensitic, grain, size, larger, grains, have, large, grain, boundaries, which, serve, as, weak, spots, in, the, structure, the, grain, size, is, usually, controlled, to, reduce, the, probability, of, breakage, the, diffusion, transformation, is, very, time, dependent, cooling, a, metal, will, usually, suppress, the, precipitation, to, a, much, lower, temperature, austenite, for, example, usually, only, exists, above, the, upper, critical, temperature, however, if, the, austenite, is, cooled, quickly, enough, the, transformation, may, be, suppressed, for, hundreds, of, degrees, below, the, lower, critical, temperature, such, austenite, is, highly, unstable, and, if, given, enough, time, will, precipitate, into, various, microstructures, of, ferrite, and, cementite, the, cooling, rate, can, be, used, to, control, the, rate, of, grain, growth, or, can, even, be, used, to, produce, partially, martensitic, microstructures, however, the, martensite, transformation, is, time, independent, if, the, alloy, is, cooled, to, the, martensite, transformation, m, s, temperature, before, other, microstructures, can, fully, form, the, transformation, will, usually, occur, at, just, under, the, speed, of, sound, when, austenite, is, cooled, but, kept, above, the, martensite, start, temperature, ms, so, that, a, martensite, transformation, does, not, occur, the, austenite, grain, size, will, have, an, effect, on, the, rate, of, nucleation, but, it, is, generally, temperature, and, the, rate, of, cooling, that, controls, the, grain, size, and, microstructure, when, austenite, is, cooled, extremely, slowly, it, will, form, large, ferrite, crystals, filled, with, spherical, inclusions, of, cementite, this, microstructure, is, referred, to, as, sphereoidite, if, cooled, a, little, faster, then, coarse, pearlite, will, form, even, faster, and, fine, pearlite, will, form, if, cooled, even, faster, bainite, will, form, with, more, complete, bainite, transformation, occurring, depending, on, the, time, held, above, martensite, start, ms, similarly, these, microstructures, will, also, form, if, cooled, to, a, specific, temperature, and, then, held, there, for, a, certain, time, most, non, ferrous, alloys, are, also, heated, in, order, to, form, a, solution, most, often, these, are, then, cooled, very, quickly, to, produce, a, martensite, transformation, putting, the, solution, into, a, supersaturated, state, the, alloy, being, in, a, much, softer, state, may, then, be, cold, worked, this, causes, work, hardening, that, increases, the, strength, and, hardness, of, the, alloy, moreover, the, defects, caused, by, plastic, deformation, tend, to, speed, up, precipitation, increasing, the, hardness, beyond, what, is, normal, for, the, alloy, even, if, not, cold, worked, the, solutes, in, these, alloys, will, usually, precipitate, although, the, process, may, take, much, longer, sometimes, these, metals, are, then, heated, to, a, temperature, that, is, below, the, lower, critical, a, 1, temperature, preventing, recrystallization, in, order, to, speed, up, the, precipitation, complex, heat, treating, schedules, or, cycles, are, often, devised, by, metallurgists, to, optimize, an, alloy, s, mechanical, properties, in, the, aerospace, industry, a, superalloy, may, undergo, five, or, more, different, heat, treating, operations, to, develop, the, desired, properties, this, can, lead, to, quality, problems, depending, on, the, accuracy, of, the, furnace, s, temperature, controls, and, timer, these, operations, can, usually, be, divided, into, several, basic, techniques, annealing, consists, of, heating, a, metal, to, a, specific, temperature, and, then, cooling, at, a, rate, that, will, produce, a, refined, microstructure, either, fully, or, partially, separating, the, constituents, the, rate, of, cooling, is, generally, slow, annealing, is, most, often, used, to, soften, a, metal, for, cold, working, to, improve, machinability, or, to, enhance, properties, like, electrical, conductivity, in, ferrous, alloys, annealing, is, usually, accomplished, by, heating, the, metal, beyond, the, upper, critical, temperature, and, then, cooling, very, slowly, resulting, in, the, formation, of, pearlite, in, both, pure, metals, and, many, alloys, that, cannot, be, heat, treated, annealing, is, used, to, remove, the, hardness, caused, by, cold, working, the, metal, is, heated, to, a, temperature, where, recrystallization, can, occur, thereby, repairing, the, defects, caused, by, plastic, deformation, in, these, metals, the, rate, of, cooling, will, usually, have, little, effect, most, non, ferrous, alloys, that, are, heat, treatable, are, also, annealed, to, relieve, the, hardness, of, cold, working, these, may, be, slowly, cooled, to, allow, full, precipitation, of, the, constituents, and, produce, a, refined, microstructure, ferrous, alloys, are, usually, either, full, annealed, or, process, annealed, full, annealing, requires, very, slow, cooling, rates, in, order, to, form, coarse, pearlite, in, process, annealing, the, cooling, rate, may, be, faster, up, to, and, including, normalizing, the, main, goal, of, process, annealing, is, to, produce, a, uniform, microstructure, non, ferrous, alloys, are, often, subjected, to, a, variety, of, annealing, techniques, including, recrystallization, annealing, partial, annealing, full, annealing, and, final, annealing, not, all, annealing, techniques, involve, recrystallization, such, as, stress, relieving, normalizing, is, a, technique, used, to, provide, uniformity, in, grain, size, and, composition, equiaxed, crystals, throughout, an, alloy, the, term, is, often, used, for, ferrous, alloys, that, have, been, austenitized, and, then, cooled, in, the, open, air, normalizing, not, only, produces, pearlite, but, also, martensite, and, sometimes, bainite, which, gives, harder, and, stronger, steel, but, with, less, ductility, for, the, same, composition, than, full, annealing, in, the, normalizing, process, the, steel, is, heated, to, about, 40, degrees, celsius, above, its, upper, critical, temperature, limit, held, at, this, temperature, for, some, time, and, then, cooled, in, air, stress, relieving, is, a, technique, to, remove, or, reduce, the, internal, stresses, created, in, metal, these, stresses, may, be, caused, in, a, number, of, ways, ranging, from, cold, working, to, non, uniform, cooling, stress, relieving, is, usually, accomplished, by, heating, a, metal, below, the, lower, critical, temperature, and, then, cooling, uniformly, stress, relieving, is, commonly, used, on, items, like, air, tanks, boilers, and, other, pressure, vessels, to, remove, a, portion, of, the, stresses, created, during, the, welding, process, some, metals, are, classified, as, precipitation, hardening, metals, when, a, precipitation, hardening, alloy, is, quenched, its, alloying, elements, will, be, trapped, in, solution, resulting, in, a, soft, metal, aging, a, solutionized, metal, will, allow, the, alloying, elements, to, diffuse, through, the, microstructure, and, form, intermetallic, particles, these, intermetallic, particles, will, nucleate, and, fall, out, of, the, solution, and, act, as, a, reinforcing, phase, thereby, increasing, the, strength, of, the, alloy, alloys, may, age, naturally, meaning, that, the, precipitates, form, at, room, temperature, or, they, may, age, artificially, when, precipitates, only, form, at, elevated, temperatures, in, some, applications, naturally, aging, alloys, may, be, stored, in, a, freezer, to, prevent, hardening, until, after, further, operations, assembly, of, rivets, for, example, maybe, easier, with, a, softer, part, examples, of, precipitation, hardening, alloys, include, 2000, series, 6000, series, and, 7000, series, aluminium, alloy, as, well, as, some, superalloys, and, some, stainless, steels, steels, that, harden, by, aging, are, typically, referred, to, as, maraging, steels, from, a, combination, of, the, term, martensite, aging, quenching, is, a, process, of, cooling, a, metal, at, a, rapid, rate, this, is, most, often, done, to, produce, a, martensite, transformation, in, ferrous, alloys, this, will, often, produce, a, harder, metal, while, non, ferrous, alloys, will, usually, become, softer, than, normal, to, harden, by, quenching, a, metal, usually, steel, or, cast, iron, must, be, heated, above, the, upper, critical, temperature, steel, above, 815, 900, degress, celsius, and, then, quickly, cooled, depending, on, the, alloy, and, other, considerations, such, as, concern, for, maximum, hardness, vs, cracking, and, distortion, cooling, may, be, done, with, forced, air, or, other, gases, such, as, nitrogen, liquids, may, be, used, due, to, their, better, thermal, conductivity, such, as, oil, water, a, polymer, dissolved, in, water, or, a, brine, upon, being, rapidly, cooled, a, portion, of, austenite, dependent, on, alloy, composition, will, transform, to, martensite, a, hard, brittle, crystalline, structure, the, quenched, hardness, of, a, metal, depends, on, its, chemical, composition, and, quenching, method, cooling, speeds, from, fastest, to, slowest, go, from, brine, polymer, i, e, mixtures, of, water, glycol, polymers, freshwater, oil, and, forced, air, however, quenching, certain, steel, too, fast, can, result, in, cracking, which, is, why, high, tensile, steels, such, as, aisi, 4140, should, be, quenched, in, oil, tool, steels, such, as, iso, 1, 2767, or, h13, hot, work, tool, steel, should, be, quenched, in, forced, air, and, low, alloy, or, medium, tensile, steels, such, as, xk1320, or, aisi, 1040, should, be, quenched, in, brine, some, beta, titanium, based, alloys, have, also, shown, similar, trends, of, increased, strength, through, rapid, cooling, however, most, non, ferrous, metals, like, alloys, of, copper, aluminum, or, nickel, and, some, high, alloy, steels, such, as, austenitic, stainless, steel, 304, 316, produce, an, opposite, effect, when, these, are, quenched, they, soften, austenitic, stainless, steels, must, be, quenched, to, become, fully, corrosion, resistant, as, they, work, harden, significantly, untempered, martensitic, steel, while, very, hard, is, too, brittle, to, be, useful, for, most, applications, a, method, for, alleviating, this, problem, is, called, tempering, most, applications, require, that, quenched, parts, be, tempered, tempering, consists, of, heating, steel, below, the, lower, critical, temperature, often, from, 400, f, to, 1105, f, or, 205, c, to, 595, c, depending, on, the, desired, results, to, impart, some, toughness, higher, tempering, temperatures, maybe, up, to, 1, 300, f, or, 700, c, depending, on, the, alloy, and, application, are, sometimes, used, to, impart, further, ductility, although, some, yield, strength, is, lost, tempering, may, also, be, performed, on, normalized, steels, other, methods, of, tempering, consist, of, quenching, to, a, specific, temperature, which, is, above, the, martensite, start, temperature, and, then, holding, it, there, until, pure, bainite, can, form, or, internal, stresses, can, be, relieved, these, include, austempering, and, martempering, steel, that, has, been, freshly, ground, or, polished, will, form, oxide, layers, when, heated, at, a, very, specific, temperature, the, iron, oxide, will, form, a, layer, with, a, very, specific, thickness, causing, thin, film, interference, this, causes, colors, to, appear, on, the, surface, of, the, steel, as, the, temperature, is, increased, the, iron, oxide, layer, grows, in, thickness, changing, the, color, these, colors, called, tempering, colors, have, been, used, for, centuries, to, gauge, the, temperature, of, the, metal, the, tempering, colors, can, be, used, to, judge, the, final, properties, of, the, tempered, steel, very, hard, tools, are, often, tempered, in, the, light, to, the, dark, straw, range, whereas, springs, are, often, tempered, to, the, blue, however, the, final, hardness, of, the, tempered, steel, will, vary, depending, on, the, composition, of, the, steel, higher, carbon, tool, steel, will, remain, much, harder, after, tempering, than, spring, steel, of, slightly, less, carbon, when, tempered, at, the, same, temperature, the, oxide, film, will, also, increase, in, thickness, over, time, therefore, steel, that, has, been, held, at, 400, f, for, a, very, long, time, may, turn, brown, or, purple, even, though, the, temperature, never, exceeded, that, needed, to, produce, a, light, straw, color, other, factors, affecting, the, final, outcome, are, oil, films, on, the, surface, and, the, type, of, heat, source, used, many, heat, treating, methods, have, been, developed, to, alter, the, properties, of, only, a, portion, of, an, object, these, tend, to, consist, of, either, cooling, different, areas, of, an, alloy, at, different, rates, by, quickly, heating, in, a, localized, area, and, then, quenching, by, thermochemical, diffusion, or, by, tempering, different, areas, of, an, object, at, different, temperatures, such, as, in, differential, tempering, some, techniques, allow, different, areas, of, a, single, object, to, receive, different, heat, treatments, this, is, called, differential, hardening, it, is, common, in, high, quality, knives, and, swords, the, chinese, jian, is, one, of, the, earliest, known, examples, of, this, and, the, japanese, katana, may, be, the, most, widely, known, the, nepalese, khukuri, is, another, example, this, technique, uses, an, insulating, layer, like, layers, of, clay, to, cover, the, areas, that, are, to, remain, soft, the, areas, to, be, hardened, are, left, exposed, allowing, only, certain, parts, of, the, steel, to, fully, harden, when, quenched, flame, hardening, is, used, to, harden, only, a, portion, of, the, metal, unlike, differential, hardening, where, the, entire, piece, is, heated, and, then, cooled, at, different, rates, in, flame, hardening, only, a, portion, of, the, metal, is, heated, before, quenching, this, is, usually, easier, than, differential, hardening, but, often, produces, an, extremely, brittle, zone, between, the, heated, metal, and, the, unheated, metal, as, cooling, at, the, edge, of, this, heat, affected, zone, is, extremely, rapid, induction, hardening, is, a, surface, hardening, technique, in, which, the, surface, of, the, metal, is, heated, very, quickly, using, a, no, contact, method, of, induction, heating, the, alloy, is, then, quenched, producing, a, martensite, transformation, at, the, surface, while, leaving, the, underlying, metal, unchanged, this, creates, a, very, hard, wear, resistant, surface, while, maintaining, the, proper, toughness, in, the, majority, of, the, object, crankshaft, journals, are, a, good, example, of, an, induction, hardened, surface, case, hardening, is, a, thermochemical, diffusion, process, in, which, an, alloying, element, most, commonly, carbon, or, nitrogen, diffuses, into, the, surface, of, a, monolithic, metal, the, resulting, interstitial, solid, solution, is, harder, than, the, base, material, which, improves, wear, resistance, without, sacrificing, toughness, laser, surface, engineering, is, a, surface, treatment, with, high, versatility, selectivity, and, novel, properties, since, the, cooling, rate, is, very, high, in, laser, treatment, metastable, even, metallic, glass, can, be, obtained, by, this, method, although, quenching, steel, causes, the, austenite, to, transform, into, martensite, all, of, the, austenite, usually, does, not, transform, some, austenite, crystals, will, remain, unchanged, even, after, quenching, below, the, martensite, finish, m, f, temperature, further, transformation, of, the, austenite, into, martensite, can, be, induced, by, slowly, cooling, the, metal, to, extremely, low, temperatures, cold, treating, generally, consists, of, cooling, the, steel, to, around, 115, f, 81, c, but, does, not, eliminate, all, of, the, austenite, cryogenic, treating, usually, consists, of, cooling, to, much, lower, temperatures, often, in, the, range, of, 315, f, 192, c, to, transform, most, of, the, austenite, into, martensite, cold, and, cryogenic, treatments, are, typically, done, immediately, after, quenching, before, any, tempering, and, will, increase, the, hardness, wear, resistance, and, reduce, the, internal, stresses, in, the, metal, but, because, it, is, really, an, extension, of, the, quenching, process, it, may, increase, the, chances, of, cracking, during, the, procedure, the, process, is, often, used, for, tools, bearings, or, other, items, that, require, good, wear, resistance, however, it, is, usually, only, effective, in, high, carbon, or, high, alloy, steels, in, which, more, than, 10, austenite, is, retained, after, quenching, the, heating, of, steel, is, sometimes, used, as, a, method, to, alter, the, carbon, content, when, steel, is, heated, in, an, oxidizing, environment, the, oxygen, combines, with, the, iron, to, form, an, iron, oxide, layer, which, protects, the, steel, from, decarburization, when, the, steel, turns, to, austenite, however, the, oxygen, combines, with, iron, to, form, a, slag, which, provides, no, protection, from, decarburization, the, formation, of, slag, and, scale, actually, increases, decarburization, because, the, iron, oxide, keeps, oxygen, in, contact, with, the, decarburization, zone, even, after, the, steel, is, moved, into, an, oxygen, free, environment, such, as, the, coals, of, a, forge, thus, the, carbon, atoms, begin, combining, with, the, surrounding, scale, and, slag, to, form, both, carbon, monoxide, and, carbon, dioxide, which, is, released, into, the, air, steel, contains, a, relatively, small, percentage, of, carbon, which, can, migrate, freely, within, the, gamma, iron, when, austenitized, steel, is, exposed, to, air, for, long, periods, of, time, the, carbon, content, in, the, steel, can, be, lowered, this, is, the, opposite, from, what, happens, when, steel, is, heated, in, a, reducing, environment, in, which, carbon, slowly, diffuses, further, into, the, metal, in, an, oxidizing, environment, the, carbon, can, readily, diffuse, outwardly, so, austenitized, steel, is, very, susceptible, to, decarburization, this, is, often, used, for, cast, steel, where, a, high, carbon, content, is, needed, for, casting, but, a, lower, carbon, content, is, desired, in, the, finished, product, it, is, often, used, on, cast, irons, to, produce, malleable, cast, iron, in, a, process, called, white, tempering, this, tendency, to, decarburize, is, often, a, problem, in, other, operations, such, as, blacksmithing, where, it, becomes, more, desirable, to, austenize, the, steel, for, the, shortest, amount, of, time, possible, to, prevent, too, much, decarburization, usually, the, end, condition, is, specified, instead, of, the, process, used, in, heat, treatment, case, hardening, is, specified, by, hardness, and, case, depth, the, case, depth, can, be, specified, in, two, ways, total, case, depth, or, effective, case, depth, the, total, case, depth, is, the, true, depth, of, the, case, for, most, alloys, the, effective, case, depth, is, the, depth, of, the, case, that, has, a, hardness, equivalent, of, hrc50, however, some, alloys, specify, a, different, hardness, 40, 60, hrc, at, effective, case, depth, this, is, checked, on, a, tukon, microhardness, tester, this, value, can, be, roughly, approximated, as, 65, of, the, total, case, depth, however, the, chemical, composition, and, hardenability, can, affect, this, approximation, if, neither, type, of, case, depth, is, specified, the, total, case, depth, is, assumed, for, case, hardened, parts, the, specification, should, have, a, tolerance, of, at, least, 0, 005, in, 0, 13, mm, if, the, part, is, to, be, ground, after, heat, treatment, the, case, depth, is, assumed, to, be, after, grinding, the, rockwell, hardness, scale, used, for, the, specification, depends, on, the, depth, of, the, total, case, depth, as, shown, in, the, table, below, usually, hardness, is, measured, on, the, rockwell, c, scale, but, the, load, used, on, the, scale, will, penetrate, through, the, case, if, the, case, is, less, than, 0, 030, in, 0, 76, mm, using, rockwell, c, for, a, thinner, case, will, result, in, a, false, reading, for, cases, that, are, less, than, 0, 015, in, 0, 38, mm, thick, a, rockwell, scale, cannot, reliably, be, used, so, file, hard, is, specified, instead, file, hard, is, approximately, equivalent, to, 58, hrc, when, specifying, the, hardness, either, a, range, should, be, given, or, the, minimum, hardness, specified, if, a, range, is, specified, at, least, 5, points, should, be, given, only, hardness, is, listed, for, through, hardening, it, is, usually, in, the, form, of, hrc, with, at, least, a, five, point, range, the, hardness, for, an, annealing, process, is, usually, listed, on, the, hrb, scale, as, a, maximum, value, it, is, a, process, to, refine, grain, size, improve, strength, remove, residual, stress, and, affect, the, electromagnetic, properties, furnaces, used, for, heat, treatment, can, be, split, into, two, broad, categories, batch, furnaces, and, continuous, furnaces, batch, furnaces, are, usually, manually, loaded, and, unloaded, whereas, continuous, furnaces, have, an, automatic, conveying, system, to, provide, a, constant, load, into, the, furnace, chamber, batch, systems, usually, consist, of, an, insulated, chamber, with, a, steel, shell, a, heating, system, and, an, access, door, to, the, chamber, many, basic, box, type, furnaces, have, been, upgraded, to, a, semi, continuous, batch, furnace, with, the, addition, of, integrated, quench, tanks, and, slow, cool, chambers, these, upgraded, furnaces, are, a, very, commonly, used, piece, of, equipment, for, heat, treating, also, known, as, a, bogie, hearth, the, car, furnace, is, an, extremely, large, batch, furnace, the, floor, is, constructed, as, an, insulated, movable, car, that, is, moved, in, and, out, of, the, furnace, for, loading, and, unloading, the, car, is, usually, sealed, using, sand, seals, or, solid, seals, when, in, position, due, to, the, difficulty, in, getting, a, sufficient, seal, car, furnaces, are, usually, used, for, non, atmosphere, processes, similar, in, type, to, the, car, furnace, except, that, the, car, and, hearth, are, rolled, into, position, beneath, the, furnace, and, raised, by, means, of, a, motor, driven, mechanism, elevator, furnaces, can, handle, large, heavy, loads, and, often, eliminate, the, need, for, any, external, cranes, and, transfer, mechanisms, bell, furnaces, have, removable, covers, called, bells, which, are, lowered, over, the, load, and, hearth, by, crane, an, inner, bell, is, placed, over, the, hearth, and, sealed, to, supply, a, protective, atmosphere, an, outer, bell, is, lowered, to, provide, the, heat, supply, furnaces, that, are, constructed, in, a, pit, and, extend, to, floor, level, or, slightly, above, are, called, pit, furnaces, workpieces, can, be, suspended, from, fixtures, held, in, baskets, or, placed, on, bases, in, the, furnace, pit, furnaces, are, suited, to, heating, long, tubes, shafts, and, rods, by, holding, them, in, a, vertical, position, this, manner, of, loading, provides, minimal, distortion, salt, baths, are, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, heat, treatment, processes, including, neutral, hardening, liquid, carburising, liquid, nitriding, austempering, martempering, and, tempering, parts, are, loaded, into, a, pot, of, molten, salt, where, they, are, heated, by, conduction, giving, a, very, readily, available, source, of, heat, the, core, temperature, of, a, part, rises, in, temperature, at, approximately, the, same, rate, as, its, surface, in, a, salt, bath, salt, baths, utilize, a, variety, of, salts, for, heat, treatment, with, cyanide, salts, being, the, most, extensively, used, concerns, about, associated, occupation, health, and, safety, and, expensive, waste, management, and, disposal, due, to, their, environmental, effects, have, made, the, use, of, salt, baths, less, attractive, in, recent, years, consequently, many, salt, baths, are, being, replaced, by, more, environmentally, friendly, fluidized, bed, furnaces, a, fluidised, bed, consists, of, a, cylindrical, retort, made, from, high, temperature, alloy, filled, with, sand, like, aluminum, oxide, particulate, gas, air, or, nitrogen, is, bubbled, through, the, oxide, and, the, sand, moves, in, such, a, way, that, it, exhibits, fluid, like, behavior, hence, the, term, fluidized, the, solid, solid, contact, of, the, oxide, gives, very, high, thermal, conductivity, and, excellent, temperature, uniformity, throughout, the, furnace, comparable, to, those, seen, in, a, salt, bath
