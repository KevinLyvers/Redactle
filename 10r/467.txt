rated, friendships, in, which, they, communicated, face, to, face, and, through, text, messaging, as, being, more, intimate, than, those, in, which, they, communicated, solely, face, to, face, this, indicates, participants, make, new, relationships, with, face, to, face, communication, at, an, early, stage, but, use, text, messaging, to, increase, their, contact, later, on, as, the,

price, led, to, about, five, million, filipinos, owning, a, cell, phone, by, 2001, because, of, the, highly, social, nature, of, philippine, culture, and, the, affordability, of, sms, compared, to, voice, calls, sms, usage, shot, up, filipinos, used, texting, not, only, for, social, messages, but, also, for, political, purposes, as, it, allowed, the, filipinos, to, express, their, opinions, on, current, events, and, political, issues, it, became, a, powerful, tool, for, filipinos, in, promoting, or, denouncing, issues, and, was, a, key, factor, during, the, 2001, edsa, ii, revolution, which, overthrew, then, president, joseph, estrada, who, was, eventually, found, guilty, of, corruption, according, to, 2009, statistics, there, were, about, 72, million, mobile, service, subscriptions,

operators, in, africa, over, the, following, couple, of, years, today, text, messaging, is, already, slowly, gaining, influence, in, the, african, market, one, such, person, used, text, messaging, to,

vote, in, online, and, tv, polls, as, well, as, receive, information, while, they, are, on, the, move, texting, can, also, bring, people, together, and, create, a, sense, of, community, through, smart, mobs, or, net, war, which, create, people, power, research, in, 2015, has, also, proven, that, text, messaging, is, somehow, making, the, social, distances, larger, and, could, be, ruining, verbal, communication, skills, for, many, people, the, small, phone, keypad, and, the, rapidity, of, typical, text, message, exchanges, have, caused, a, number, of, spelling, abbreviations, as, in, the, phrase, txt, msg, u, an, abbreviation, for, you, hmu, hit, me, up, i, e, call, me, or, use, of, camel, case, such, as, in, thisisverylame, to, avoid, the, even, more, limited, message, lengths, allowed, when, using, cyrillic, or, greek, letters, speakers, of, languages, written, in, those, alphabets, often, use, the, latin, alphabet, for, their, own, language, in, certain, languages, utilizing, diacritic, marks, such, as, polish, sms, technology, created, an, entire, new, variant, of, written, language, characters, normally, written, with, diacritic, marks, e, g, in, polish, are, now, being, written, without, them, as, a, e, s, z, to, enable, using, cell, phones, without, polish, script, or, to, save, space, in, unicode, messages, historically, this, language, developed, out, of, shorthand, used, in, bulletin, board, systems, and, later, in, internet, chat, rooms, where, users, would, abbreviate, some, words, to, allow, a, response, to, be, typed, more, quickly, though, the, amount, of, time, saved, was, often, inconsequential, however, this, became, much, more, pronounced, in, sms, where, mobile, phone, users, either, have, a, numeric, keyboard, with, older, cellphones, or, a, small, qwerty, keyboard, for, 2010s, era, smartphones, so, more, effort, is, required, to, type, each, character, and, there, is, sometimes, a, limit, on, the, number, of, characters, that, may, be, sent, in, mandarin, chinese, numbers, that, sound, similar, to, words, are, used, in, place, of, those, words, for, example, the, numbers, 520, in, chinese, w, r, l, ng,

tegic, s, t9, as, well, as, itap, or, letters, eatoni, s, letterwise, reduces, the, labour, of, time, consuming, input, this, makes, abbreviations, not, only, less, necessary, but, slower, to, type, than, regular, words, that, are, in, the, software, s, dictionary, however, it, makes, the, messages, longer, often, requiring, the, text, message, to, be, sent, in, multiple, parts, and, therefore, costing, more, to, send, the, use, of, text, messaging, has, changed, the, way, that, people, talk, and, write, essays, some, believing, it, to, be, harmful, children, today, are, receiving, cell, phones, at, an, age, as, young, as, eight, years, old, more, than, 35, per, cent, of, children, in, second, and, third, grade, have, their, own, mobile, phones, because, of, this, the, texting, language, is, integrated, into, the, way, that, students, think, from, an, earlier, age, than, ever, before, in, november, 2006, new, zealand, qualifications, authority, approved, the, move, that, allowed, students, of, secondary, schools, to, use, mobile, phone, text, language, in, the, end, of, the, year, exam, papers, highly, publicized, reports, beginning, in, 2002, of, the, use, of, text, language, in, school, assignments, caused, some, to, become, concerned, that, the, quality, of, written, communication, is, on, the, decline, and, other, reports, claim, that, teachers, and, professors, are, beginning, to, have, a, hard, time, controlling, the, problem, however, the, notion, that, text, language, is, widespread, or, harmful, is, refuted, by, research, from, linguistic, experts, an, article, in, the, new, yorker, explores, how, text, messaging, has, anglicized, some, of, the, world, s, languages, the, use, of, diacritic, marks, is, dropped, in, languages, such, as, french, as, well, as, symbols, in, ethiopian, languages, in, his, book, txtng, the, gr8, db8, which, translates, as, texting, the, great, debate, david, crystal, states, that, texters, in, all, eleven, languages, use, lol, laughing, out, loud, u, brb, be, right, back, and, gr8, great, all, english, based, shorthands, the, use, of, pictograms, and, logograms, in, texts, are, present, in, every, language, they, shorten, words, by, using, symbols, to, represent, the, word, or, symbols, whose, name, sounds, like, a, syllable, of, the, word, such, as, in, 2day, or, b4, this, is, commonly, used, in, other, languages, as, well, crystal, gives, some, examples, in, several, languages, such, as, italian, sei, six, is, used, for, sei, you, are, example, dv6, dove, sei, where, are, you, and, french, k7, cassette, cassette, tape, there, is, also, the, use, of, numeral, sequences, substituting, for, several, syllables, of, a, word, and, creating, whole, phrases, using, numerals, for, example, in, french, a12c4, can, be, said, as, un, de, ces, quatres, see, you, around, literally, to, one, of, these, four, an, example, of, using, symbols, in, texting, and, borrowing, from, english, is, the, use, of, whenever, it, is, used, in, texting, its, intended, use, is, with, the, english, pronunciation, crystal, gives, the, example, of, the, welsh, use, of, in, f, pronounced, ataf, meaning, to, me, in, character, based, languages, such, as, chinese, and, japanese, numbers, are, assigned, syllables, based, on, the, shortened, form, of, the, pronunciation, of, the, number, sometimes, the, english, pronunciation, of, the, number, in, this, way, numbers, alone, can, be, used, to, communicate, whole, passages, such, as, in, chinese, 8807701314520, b, o, bao, n, q, ng, qing, n, y, sh, ng, y, sh, w, i, n, can, be, literally, translated, as, hug, hug, you, kiss, you, whole, life, whole, life, i, love, you, english, influences, worldwide, texting, in, variation, but, still, in, combination, with, the, individual, properties, of, languages, american, popular, culture, is, also, recognized, in, shorthand, for, example, homer, simpson, translates, into, 8, crystal, also, suggests, that, texting, has, led, to, more, creativity, in, the, english, language, giving, people, opportunities, to, create, their, own, slang, emoticons, abbreviations, acronyms, etc, the, feeling, of, individualism, and, freedom, makes, texting, more, popular, and, a, more, efficient, way, to, communicate, crystal, has, also, been, quoted, in, saying, that, in, a, logical, world, text, messaging, should, not, have, survived, but, text, messaging, didn, t, just, come, out, of, nowhere, it, originally, began, as, a, messaging, system, that, would, send, out, emergency, information, but, it, gained, immediate, popularity, with, the, public, what, followed, is, the, sms, we, see, today, which, is, a, very, quick, and, efficient, way, of, sharing, information, from, person, to, person, work, by, richard, ling, has, shown, that, texting, has, a, gendered, dimension, and, it, plays, into, the, development, of, teen, identity, in, addition, we, text, to, a, very, small, number, of, other, persons, for, most, people, half, of, their, texts, go, to, 3, 5, other, people, research, by, rosen, et, al, 2009, found, that, those, young, adults, who, used, more, language, based, textisms, shortcuts, such, as, lol, 2nite, etc, in, daily, writing, produced, worse, formal, writing, than, those, young, adults, who, used, fewer, linguistic, textisms, in, daily, writing, however, the, exact, opposite, was, true, for, informal, writing, this, suggests, that, perhaps, the, act, of, using, textisms, to, shorten, communication, words, leads, young, adults, to, produce, more, informal, writing, which, may, then, help, them, to, be, better, informal, writers, due, to, text, messaging, teens, are, writing, more, and, some, teachers, see, that, this, comfort, with, language, can, be, harnessed, to, make, better, writers, this, new, form, of, communication, may, be, encouraging, students, to, put, their, thoughts, and, feelings, into, words, and, this, may, be, able, to, be, used, as, a, bridge, to, get, them, more, interested, in, formal, writing, joan, h, lee, in, her, thesis, what, does, txting, do, 2, language, the, influences, of, exposure, to, messaging, and, print, media, on, acceptability, constraints, 2011, she, associates, exposure, to, text, messaging, with, more, rigid, acceptability, constraints, the, thesis, suggests, that, more, exposure, to, the, colloquial, generation, text, language, of, text, messaging, contributes, to, being, less, accepting, of, words, in, contrast, lee, found, that, students, with, more, exposure, to, traditional, print,

review, of, academic, literature, on, the, effects, of, text, messaging, on, language, texting, has, also, been, shown, to, have, had, no, effect, or, some, positive, effects, on, literacy, according, to, plester, wood, and, joshi, and, their, research, done, on, the, study, of, 88, british, 10, 12, year, old, children, and, their, knowledge, of, text, messages, textisms, are, essentially, forms, of, phonetic, abbreviation, that, show, that, to, produce, and, read, such, abbreviations, arguably, requires, a, level, of, phonological, awareness, and, orthographic, awareness, in, the, child,

conducted, a, survey, with, more, than, 900, teens, from, over, 26, high, schools, nationwide, the, results, showed, that, 87, of, students, found, texting, to, be, very, or, extremely, distracting, a, study, by, aaa, found, that, 46, of, teens, admitted, to, being, distracted, behind, the, wheel, due, to, texting, one, example, of, distraction, behind, the, wheel, is, the, 2008, chatsworth,

more, than, 100, long, haul, trucks, which, recorded, the, drivers, over, a, combined, driving, distance, of, three, million, miles, the, study, concluded, that, when, the, drivers, were, texting, their, risk, of, crashing, was, 23, times, greater, than, when, not, texting, due, to, the, proliferation, of, smart, phone, applications, performed, while, walking, texting, while, walking, or,

leads, to, increased, cognitive, distraction, and, reduced, situation, awareness, and, may, lead, to, increases, in, unsafe, behaviour, leading, to, injury, and, death, recent, studies, conducted, on, cell, phone, use, while, walking, showed, that, cell, phone, users, recall, fewer, objects, when, conversing, walk, slower, have, altered, gait, and, are, more, unsafe, when, crossing, a, street, additionally, some, gait, analyses, showed, that, stance, phase, during, overstepping, motion, longitudinal, and, lateral, deviation, increased, during, cell, phone, operation, but, step, length, and,

task, such, as, texting, while, walking, may, interfere, with, working, memory, and, result, in, walking, errors, their, study, demonstrated, that, participants, engaged, in, text, messaging, were, unable, to, maintain, walking, speed, or, retain, accurate, spatial, information, suggesting, an, inability, to, adequately, divide, their, attention, between, two, tasks, according, to, them, the, addition, of, texting, while, walking, with, vision, occluded, increases, the, demands, placed, on, the, working, memory, system, resulting, in, gait, disruptions, texting, on, a, phone, distracts, participants, even, when, the, texting, task, used, is, a, relatively, simple, one, stavrinos, et, al, investigated, the, effect, of, other, cognitive, tasks, such, as, engaging, in, conversations, or, cognitive, tasks, on, a, phone, and, found, that, participants, actually, have, reduced, visual, awareness, this, finding, was, supported, by, licence, et, al, who, conducted, a, similar, study, for, example, texting, pedestrians, may, fail, to, notice, unusual, events, in, their, environment, such, as, a, unicycling, clown, these, findings, suggest, that, tasks, that, require, the, allocation, of, cognitive, resources, can, affect, visual, attention, even, when, the, task, itself, does, not, require, the, participants, to, avert, their, eyes, from, their, environment, the, act, of, texting, itself, seems, to, impair, pedestrians, visual, awareness, it, appears, that, the, distraction, produced, by, texting, is, a, combination, of, both, a, cognitive, and, visual, perceptual, distraction, a, study, conducted, by, licence, et, al, supported, some, of, these, findings, particularly, that, those, who, text, while, walking, significantly, alter, their, gait, however, they, also, found, that, the, gait, pattern, texters, adopted, was, slower, and, more, protective, and, consequently, did, not, increase, obstacle, contact, or, tripping, in, a, typical, pedestrian, context, there, have, also, been, technological, approaches, to, increase, the, safety, awareness, of, pedestrians, that, are, unintentionally, blind, while, using, a, smartphone, e, g, using, a,

between, mobile, devices, using, sms, it, contains, either, text, images, or, video, that, is, intended, to, be, sexually, arousing, sexting, was, reported, as, early, as, 2005, in, the, sunday, telegraph, magazine, constituting, a, trend, in, the, creative, use, of, sms, to, excite, another, with, alluring, messages, throughout, the, day, although, sexting, often, takes, place, consensually, between, two, people, it, can, also, occur, against, the, wishes, of, a, person, who, is, the, subject, of, the, content, a, number, of, instances, have, been, reported, in, which, the, recipients, of, sexting, have, shared, the, content, of, the, messages, with, others, with, less, intimate, intentions, such, as, to, impress, their, friends, or, embarrass, their, sender, celebrities, such, as, miley, cyrus, vanessa, hudgens, and, adrienne, bailon, have, been, victims, of, such, abuses, of, sexting, a, 2008, survey, by, the, national, campaign, to, prevent, teen, and, unplanned, pregnancy,

boys, and, one, quarter, 25, per, cent, of, teen, girls, say, they, were, shown, private, nude, or, semi, nude, images, according, to, the, survey, sexually, suggestive, messages, text, e, mail, and, instant, messaging, were, even, more, common, than, images, with, 39, per, cent, of, teens, having, sent, or, posted, such, messages, and, half, of, the, teens, 50, per, cent, having, received, them, a, 2012, study, that, has, received, wide, international, media, attention, was, conducted, at, the, university, of, utah, department, of, psychology, by, donald, s, strassberg, ryan, kelly, mckinnon, michael, susta, ta, and, jordan, rullo, they, surveyed, 606, teenagers, ages, 14, 18, and, found, that, nearly, 20, per, cent, of, the, students, said, they, had, sent, a, sexually, explicit, image, of, themselves, via, cell, phone, and, nearly, twice, as, many, said, that, they, had, received, a, sexually, explicit, picture, of, those, receiving, such, a, picture, over, 25, per, cent, indicated, that, they, had, forwarded, it, to, others, in, addition, of, those, who, had, sent, a, sexually, explicit, picture, over, a, third, had, done, so, despite, believing, that, there, could, be, serious, legal, and, other, consequences, if, they, got, caught, students, who, had, sent, a, picture, by, cell, phone, were, more, likely, than, others, to, find, the, activity, acceptable, the, authors, conclude, these, results, argue, for, educational, efforts, such, as, cell, phone, safety, assemblies, awareness, days, integration, into, class, curriculum, and, teacher, training, designed, to, raise, awareness, about, the, potential, consequences, of, sexting, among, young, people, sexting, becomes, a, legal, issue, when, teens, under, 18, are, involved, because, any, nude, photos, they,

companies, use, an, sms, gateway, provider, based, on, ss7, connectivity, to, route, the, messages, the, advantage, of, this, international, termination, model, is, the, ability, to, route, data,

to, go, through, the, sms, c, of, other, mobile, operators, this, approach, reduces, the, number, of, mobile, operators, that, handle, the, message, however, experts, have, advised, not, to, consider,
