a, saddle, is, a, supportive, structure, for, a, rider, of, an, animal, fastened, to, an, animal, s, back, by, a, girth, the, most, common, type, is, equestrian, however, specialized, saddles, have, been, created, for, oxen, camels, and, other, animals, it, is, not, known, precisely, when, riders, first, began, to, use, some, sort, of, padding, or, protection, but, a, blanket, attached, by, some, form, of, surcingle, or, girth, was, probably, the, first, saddle, followed, later, by, more, elaborate, padded, designs, the, solid, saddle, tree, was, a, later, invention, and, though, early, stirrup, designs, predated, the, invention, of, the, solid, tree, the, paired, stirrup, which, attached, to, the, tree, was, the, last, element, of, the, saddle, to, reach, the, basic, form, that, is, still, used, today, today, modern, saddles, come, in, a, wide, variety, of, styles, each, designed, for, a, specific, equestrianism, discipline, and, require, careful, fit, to, both, the, rider, and, the, horse, proper, saddle, care, can, extend, the, useful, life, of, a, saddle, often, for, decades, the, saddle, was, a, crucial, step, in, the, increased, use, of, domesticated, animals, during, the, classical, era, the, word, saddle, originates, from, the, proto, germanic, language, sathulaz, with, cognates, in, various, other, indo, european, languages, including, the, latin, sella, some, saddles, also, include, there, is, evidence, though, disputed, that, humans, first, began, riding, the, horse, not, long, after, domestication, possibly, as, early, as, 4000, bc, the, earliest, known, saddle, like, equipment, were, fringed, cloths, or, pads, used, by, assyrian, cavalry, around, 700, bc, these, were, held, on, with, a, girth, or, surcingle, that, included, breast, straps, and, cruppers, from, the, earliest, depictions, saddles, became, status, symbols, to, show, off, an, individual, s, wealth, and, status, embellishments, were, added, to, saddles, including, elaborate, sewing, and, leather, work, precious, metals, such, as, gold, carvings, of, wood, and, horn, and, other, ornamentation, the, earliest, saddle, known, thus, far, was, discovered, inside, a, woman, s, tomb, in, the, turpan, basin, in, what, is, now, xinjiang, china, dating, to, between, 727, 396, bc, the, saddle, is, made, of, cushioned, cow, hide, and, shows, signs, of, usage, and, repair, the, tomb, is, associated, with, the, subeixi, culture, which, is, associated, with, the, jushi, kingdom, described, in, later, chinese, sources, the, subeixi, people, had, contact, with, scythians, and, share, a, similar, material, culture, with, the, pazyryk, culture, where, later, saddles, were, found, eurasian, and, northern, asian, nomads, on, the, mongolian, plateau, developed, an, early, form, of, saddle, with, a, rudimentary, frame, which, included, two, parallel, leather, cushions, with, girth, attached, to, them, a, pommel, and, cantle, with, detachable, bone, horn, hardened, leather, facings, leather, thongs, a, crupper, breastplate, and, a, felt, shabrack, adorned, with, animal, motifs, these, were, located, in, pazyryk, burials, finds, these, saddles, found, in, the, ukok, plateau, siberia, were, dated, to, 500, 400, bc, iconographic, evidence, of, a, predecessor, to, the, modern, saddle, has, been, found, in, the, art, of, the, ancient, armenians, assyrians, and, steppe, nomads, depicted, on, the, assyrian, stone, relief, carvings, from, the, time, of, ashurnasirpal, ii, the, scythians, also, developed, an, early, saddle, that, included, padding, and, decorative, embellishments, though, they, had, neither, a, solid, tree, nor, stirrups, these, early, treeless, saddles, and, pads, provided, protection, and, comfort, to, the, rider, with, a, slight, increase, in, security, the, sarmatians, also, used, a, padded, treeless, early, saddle, possibly, as, early, as, the, seventh, century, bc, and, ancient, greek, artworks, of, alexander, the, great, of, macedon, depict, a, saddle, cloth, the, greeks, called, the, saddlecloth, or, pad, ephippium, or, early, solid, treed, saddles, were, made, of, felt, that, covered, a, wooden, frame, chinese, saddles, are, depicted, among, the, cavalry, horses, in, the, terracotta, army, of, the, qin, dynasty, completed, by, 206, bc, asian, designs, proliferated, during, china, s, han, dynasty, approximately, 200, bc, one, of, the, earliest, solid, treed, saddles, in, the, western, world, was, the, four, horn, design, first, used, by, the, romans, as, early, as, the, 1st, century, bc, neither, design, had, stirrups, recent, archeological, finds, in, mongolia, e, g, urd, ulaan, uneet, site, suggest, that, the, mongolic, rouran, tribes, had, sophisticated, wooden, frame, saddles, as, early, as, the, 3rd, century, ad, the, wooden, frame, saddle, found, at, the, urd, ulaan, uneet, site, in, mongolia, is, one, of, the, earliest, examples, found, in, central, and, east, asia, the, development, of, the, solid, saddle, tree, was, significant, it, raised, the, rider, above, the, horse, s, back, and, distributed, the, rider, s, weight, on, either, side, of, the, animal, s, spine, instead, of, pinpointing, pressure, at, the, rider, s, seat, bones, reducing, the, pressure, force, per, unit, area, on, any, one, part, of, the, horse, s, back, thus, greatly, increasing, the, comfort, of, the, horse, and, prolonging, its, useful, life, the, invention, of, the, solid, saddle, tree, also, allowed, development, of, the, true, stirrup, as, it, is, known, today, without, a, solid, tree, the, rider, s, weight, in, the, stirrups, creates, abnormal, pressure, points, and, makes, the, horse, s, back, sore, thermography, studies, on, treeless, and, flexible, tree, saddle, designs, have, found, that, there, is, considerable, friction, across, the, center, line, of, a, horse, s, back, the, stirrup, was, one, of, the, milestones, in, saddle, development, the, first, stirrup, like, object, was, invented, in, india, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, and, consisted, of, a, simple, leather, strap, in, which, the, rider, s, toe, was, placed, it, offered, very, little, support, however, mongolic, rouran, tribes, in, mongolia, are, thought, to, have, been, the, inventors, of, the, modern, stirrup, but, the, first, dependable, representation, of, a, rider, with, paired, stirrups, was, found, in, china, in, a, jin, dynasty, tomb, of, about, 302, ad, the, stirrup, appeared, to, be, in, widespread, use, across, china, by, 477, ad, and, later, spread, to, europe, this, invention, gave, great, support, for, the, rider, and, was, essential, in, later, warfare, accounts, of, the, cavalry, system, of, the, mali, empire, describe, the, use, of, stirrups, and, saddles, in, the, cavalry, stirrups, and, saddles, brought, about, innovation, in, new, tactics, such, as, mass, charges, with, thrusting, spears, and, swords, saddles, were, improved, upon, during, the, middle, ages, as, knights, needed, saddles, that, were, stronger, and, offered, more, support, the, resulting, saddle, had, a, higher, cantle, and, pommel, to, prevent, the, rider, from, being, unseated, in, warfare, and, was, built, on, a, wooden, tree, that, supported, more, weight, from, a, rider, with, armor, and, weapons, this, saddle, a, predecessor, to, the, modern, western, saddle, was, originally, padded, with, wool, or, horsehair, and, covered, in, leather, or, textiles, it, was, later, modified, for, cattle, tending, and, bullfighting, in, addition, to, the, continual, development, for, use, in, war, other, saddles, derived, from, earlier, treeless, designs, sometimes, added, solid, trees, to, support, stirrups, but, were, kept, light, for, use, by, messengers, and, for, horse, racing, the, saddle, eventually, branched, off, into, different, designs, that, became, the, modern, english, and, western, saddles, one, variant, of, the, english, saddle, was, developed, by, fran, ois, robinchon, de, la, gu, rini, re, a, french, riding, master, and, author, of, ecole, de, cavalerie, who, made, major, contributions, to, what, today, is, known, as, classical, dressage, he, put, great, emphasis, on, the, proper, development, of, a, three, point, seat, that, is, still, used, today, by, many, dressage, riders, in, the, 18th, century, fox, hunting, became, increasingly, popular, in, england, the, high, cantle, high, pommel, design, of, earlier, saddles, became, a, hindrance, unsafe, and, uncomfortable, for, riders, as, they, jumped, due, to, this, fact, gu, rini, re, s, saddle, design, which, included, a, low, pommel, and, cantle, and, allowed, for, more, freedom, of, movement, for, both, horse, and, rider, became, increasingly, popular, throughout, northern, europe, in, the, early, 20th, century, captain, frederico, caprilli, revolutionized, the, jumping, saddle, by, placing, the, flap, at, an, angle, that, allowed, a, rider, to, achieve, the, forward, seat, necessary, for, jumping, high, fences, and, traveling, rapidly, across, rugged, terrain, the, modern, western, saddle, was, developed, from, the, spanish, saddles, that, were, brought, by, the, spanish, conquistadors, when, they, came, to, the, americas, these, saddles, were, adapted, to, suit, the, needs, of, vaqueros, and, cowboys, of, mexico, texas, and, california, including, the, addition, of, a, horn, that, allowed, a, lariat, to, be, tied, or, dallied, for, the, purpose, of, holding, cattle, and, other, livestock, in, the, western, world, there, are, two, basic, types, of, saddles, used, today, for, horseback, riding, usually, called, the, english, saddle, and, the, stock, saddle, the, best, known, stock, saddle, is, the, american, western, saddle, followed, by, the, australian, stock, saddle, in, asia, and, throughout, the, world, there, are, numerous, saddles, of, unique, designs, used, by, various, nationalities, and, ethnic, groups, english, saddles, are, used, for, english, riding, throughout, the, world, not, just, in, england, or, english, speaking, countries, they, are, the, saddles, used, in, all, of, the, olympic, equestrian, disciplines, the, term, english, saddle, encompasses, several, different, styles, of, saddle, including, those, used, for, eventing, show, jumping, and, hunt, seat, dressage, saddle, seat, horse, racing, horse, surfing, and, polo, the, major, distinguishing, feature, of, an, english, saddle, is, its, flatter, appearance, the, lack, of, a, horn, and, the, self, padding, design, of, the, panels, a, pair, of, pads, attached, to, the, underside, of, the, seat, and, filled, with, wool, foam, or, air, however, the, length, and, angle, of, the, flaps, the, depth, of, the, seat, and, height, of, the, cantle, all, play, a, role, in, the, use, for, which, a, particular, saddle, is, intended, the, tree, that, underlies, the, saddle, is, usually, one, of, the, defining, features, of, saddle, quality, traditionally, the, tree, of, an, english, saddle, is, built, of, laminated, layers, of, high, quality, wood, reinforced, with, spring, steel, along, its, length, with, a, riveted, gullet, plate, these, trees, are, semi, adjustable, and, are, considered, spring, trees, they, have, some, give, but, a, minimum, amount, of, flexibility, more, recently, saddle, manufacturers, are, using, various, materials, to, replace, wood, and, create, a, synthetic, molded, tree, some, with, the, integrated, spring, steel, and, gullet, plate, some, without, synthetic, materials, vary, widely, in, quality, polyurethane, trees, are, often, very, well, made, but, some, cheap, saddles, are, made, with, fiberglass, trees, of, limited, durability, synthetic, trees, are, often, lighter, more, durable, and, easier, to, customize, some, designs, are, intended, to, be, more, flexible, and, move, with, the, horse, several, companies, offer, flexible, trees, or, adjustable, gullets, that, allow, the, same, saddle, to, be, used, on, different, sizes, of, horses, western, saddles, are, saddles, originally, designed, to, be, used, on, horses, on, working, cattle, ranches, in, the, united, states, used, today, in, a, wide, variety, of, western, riding, activities, they, are, the, cowboy, saddles, familiar, to, movie, viewers, rodeo, fans, and, those, who, have, gone, on, tourist, trail, rides, the, western, saddle, has, minimal, padding, of, its, own, and, must, be, used, with, a, saddle, blanket, or, pad, in, order, to, provide, a, comfortable, fit, for, the, horse, it, also, has, sturdier, stirrups, and, uses, a, cinch, rather, than, a, girth, its, most, distinctive, feature, is, the, horn, on, the, front, of, the, saddle, originally, used, to, dally, a, lariat, when, roping, cattle, other, nations, such, as, australia, and, argentina, have, stock, saddles, that, usually, do, not, have, a, horn, but, have, other, features, commonly, seen, in, a, western, saddle, including, a, deep, seat, high, cantle, and, heavier, leather, the, tree, of, a, western, saddle, is, the, most, critical, component, defining, the, size, and, shape, of, the, finished, product, the, tree, determines, both, the, width, and, length, of, the, saddle, as, it, sits, on, the, back, of, the, horse, as, well, as, the, length, of, the, seat, for, the, rider, width, of, the, swells, pommel, height, of, cantle, and, usually, shape, of, the, horn, traditional, trees, were, made, of, wood, or, wood, laminate, covered, with, rawhide, and, this, style, is, still, manufactured, today, though, modern, synthetic, materials, are, also, used, the, rawhide, is, stretched, and, molded, around, the, tree, with, minimal, padding, between, the, tree, and, the, exterior, leather, usually, a, bit, of, relatively, thin, padding, on, the, seat, and, a, sheepskin, cover, on, the, underside, of, the, skirts, to, prevent, chafing, and, rubbing, on, the, horse, though, a, western, saddle, is, often, considerably, heavier, than, an, english, saddle, the, tree, is, designed, to, spread, out, the, weight, of, the, rider, and, any, equipment, the, rider, may, be, carrying, so, that, there, are, fewer, pounds, per, square, inch, on, the, horse, s, back, and, when, properly, fitted, few, if, any, pressure, points, thus, the, design, in, spite, of, its, weight, can, be, used, for, many, hours, with, relatively, little, discomfort, to, a, properly, conditioned, horse, and, rider, british, universal, pattern, military, saddles, were, used, by, the, mounted, forces, from, australia, britain, canada, new, zealand, and, south, africa, the, steel, arch, universal, pattern, mark, i, was, issued, in, 1891, this, was, found, to, irritate, riders, and, in, 1893, it, was, discontinued, in, favour, of, the, mark, ii, in, 1898, the, mark, iii, appeared, which, had, the, addition, of, a, v, shaped, arrangement, of, strap, billets, on, the, sideboards, for, the, attachment, of, the, girth, this, girthing, system, could, be, moved, forward, or, back, to, obtain, an, optimum, fit, on, a, wide, range, of, horses, from, 1902, the, universal, military, saddle, was, manufactured, with, a, fixed, tree, broad, panels, to, spread, the, load, and, initially, a, front, arch, in, three, sizes, the, advantage, of, this, saddle, was, its, lightness, ease, of, repair, and, comfort, for, horse, and, rider, from, 1912, the, saddle, was, built, on, an, adjustable, tree, and, consequently, only, one, size, was, needed, its, advantage, over, the, fixed, tree, 1902, pattern, was, its, ability, to, maintain, a, better, fit, on, the, horse, s, back, as, the, horse, gained, or, lost, weight, this, saddle, was, made, using, traditional, methods, and, featured, a, seat, blocked, from, sole, leather, which, maintained, its, shape, well, military, saddles, were, fitted, with, metal, staples, and, dees, to, carry, a, sword, spare, horse, shoes, and, other, equipment, in, the, us, the, mcclellan, saddle, was, introduced, in, the, 1850s, by, george, b, mcclellan, for, use, by, the, united, states, cavalry, and, the, core, design, was, used, continuously, with, some, improvements, until, the, 1940s, today, the, mcclellan, saddle, continues, to, be, used, by, ceremonial, mounted, units, in, the, u, s, army, the, basic, design, that, inspired, mcclellan, saw, use, by, military, units, in, several, other, nations, including, rhodesia, and, mexico, and, even, to, a, degree, by, the, british, in, the, boer, war, military, saddles, are, still, produced, and, are, now, used, in, exhibitions, parades, and, other, events, saddles, in, asia, date, to, the, time, of, the, scythians, and, cimmerians, modern, asian, saddles, can, be, divided, into, two, groups, those, from, nomadic, eurasia, which, have, a, prominent, horn, and, leather, covering, and, those, from, east, asia, which, have, a, high, pommel, and, cantle, central, asian, saddles, are, noted, for, their, wide, seats, and, high, horns, the, saddle, has, a, base, of, wood, with, a, thin, leather, covering, that, frequently, has, a, lacquer, finish, central, asian, saddles, have, no, pad, and, must, be, ridden, with, a, saddle, blanket, the, horn, comes, in, particular, good, use, during, the, rough, horseback, sport, of, buskashi, played, throughout, central, asia, which, involves, two, teams, of, riders, wrestling, over, a, decapitated, goat, s, carcass, in, the, near, east, a, saddle, large, enough, to, carry, more, than, one, person, is, called, a, howdah, which, is, fitted, on, elephants, some, of, the, largest, examples, of, a, saddle, elaborate, howdah, were, used, in, warfare, outfitted, with, weaponry, and, alternatively, for, monarchs, maharajahs, and, sultans, saddles, from, east, asia, differ, from, central, asian, saddles, by, their, high, pommel, and, cantle, and, lack, of, a, horn, east, asian, saddles, can, be, divided, into, several, types, that, are, associated, with, certain, nationalities, and, ethnic, groups, saddles, used, by, the, han, chinese, are, noted, by, their, use, of, inlay, work, for, ornamentation, tibetan, saddles, typically, employ, iron, covers, inlaid, with, precious, metals, on, the, pommel, and, cantle, and, universally, come, with, padding, mongolian, saddles, are, similar, to, the, tibetan, style, except, that, they, are, typically, smaller, and, the, seat, has, a, high, ridge, saddles, from, ethnic, minority, groups, in, china, s, southwest, such, as, in, sichuan, and, yunnan, provinces, have, colorful, lacquer, work, over, a, leather, covering, japanese, saddles, are, classified, as, chinese, style, karagura, or, japanese, style, yamatogura, in, the, nara, period, the, chinese, style, was, adopted, gradually, the, japanese, changed, the, saddle, to, suit, their, needs, and, in, the, heian, period, the, saddle, typically, associated, with, the, samurai, class, was, developed, these, saddles, known, as, kura, were, lacquered, as, protection, from, the, weather, early, samurai, warfare, was, conducted, primarily, on, horseback, and, the, kura, provided, a, rugged, stable, comfortable, platform, for, shooting, arrows, but, it, was, not, well, suited, for, speed, or, distance, in, the, edo, period, horses, were, no, longer, needed, for, warfare, and, japanese, saddles, became, quite, elaborate, and, were, decorated, with, mother, of, pearl, inlays, gold, leaf, and, designs, in, colored, lacquer, a, saddle, regardless, of, type, must, fit, both, horse, and, rider, saddle, fitting, is, an, art, and, in, ideal, circumstances, is, performed, by, a, professional, saddle, maker, or, saddle, fitter, custom, made, saddles, designed, for, an, individual, horse, and, rider, will, fit, the, best, but, are, also, the, most, expensive, however, many, manufactured, saddles, provide, a, decent, fit, if, properly, selected, and, some, minor, adjustments, can, be, made, the, definition, of, a, fitting, saddle, is, still, controversial, however, there, is, a, general, rule, for, fitting, that, no, damage, should, occur, to, the, horse, s, skin, and, no, injury, should, be, presented, to, any, muscular, or, neural, tissues, beneath, the, saddle, width, of, the, saddle, is, the, primary, means, by, which, a, saddle, is, measured, and, fitted, to, a, horse, though, length, of, tree, and, proper, balance, must, also, be, considered, the, gullet, of, a, saddle, must, clear, the, withers, of, the, horse, but, yet, must, not, be, so, narrow, as, to, pinch, the, horse, s, back, the, tree, must, be, positioned, so, that, the, tree, points, english, or, bars, western, do, not, interfere, with, the, movement, of, the, horse, s, shoulder, the, seat, of, the, saddle, must, be, positioned, so, that, the, rider, when, riding, correctly, is, placed, over, the, horse, s, center, of, balance, the, bars, of, the, saddle, must, not, be, so, long, that, they, place, pressure, beyond, the, last, rib, of, the, horse, a, too, short, tree, alone, does, not, usually, create, a, problem, as, shorter, trees, are, most, often, on, saddles, made, for, children, though, a, short, tree, with, an, unbalanced, adult, rider, may, create, abnormal, pressure, points, while, a, horse, s, back, can, be, measured, for, size, and, shape, the, saddle, must, be, tried, on, the, individual, animal, to, assure, proper, fit, saddle, blankets, or, pads, can, provide, assistance, to, correct, minor, fit, problems, as, well, as, provide, comfort, and, protection, to, the, horse, s, back, but, no, amount, of, padding, can, compensate, for, a, poor, fitting, saddle, the, common, problems, associated, with, saddle, fitting, problems, are, bridging, ill, fitting, headplates, and, incorrect, stuffing, of, the, panels, riding, carelessly, on, a, saddle, may, produce, what, is, called, a, saddle, horn, injury, of, the, pelvis, it, occurs, during, horse, riding, when, a, horse, rider, hits, the, horn, of, the, saddle, the, pelvic, ring, may, undergo, anteroposterior, compression, of, the, pelvic, ring, causing, a, separation, of, symphyseal, joint, even, the, sacroiliac, joint, which, is, far, more, stable, may, be, injured
