a, farm, also, called, an, agricultural, holding, is, an, area, of, land, that, is, devoted, primarily, to, agricultural, processes, with, the, primary, objective, of, producing, food, and, other, crops, it, is, the, basic, facility, in, food, production, the, name, is, used, for, specialized, units, such, as, arable, farms, vegetable, farms, fruit, farms, dairy, pig, and, poultry, farms, and, land, used, for, the, production, of, natural, fiber, biofuel, and, other, commodities, it, includes, ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations, and, estates, smallholdings, and, hobby, farms, and, includes, the, farmhouse, and, agricultural, buildings, as, well, as, the, land, in, modern, times, the, term, has, been, extended, so, as, to, include, such, industrial, operations, as, wind, farms, and, fish, farms, both, of, which, can, operate, on, land, or, at, sea, there, are, about, 570, million, farms, in, the, world, most, of, which, are, small, and, family, operated, small, farms, with, a, land, area, of, fewer, than, 2, hectares, operate, on, about, 12, of, the, world, s, agricultural, land, and, family, farms, comprise, about, 75, of, the, world, s, agricultural, land, modern, farms, in, developed, countries, are, highly, mechanized, in, the, united, states, livestock, may, be, raised, on, rangeland, and, finished, in, feedlots, and, the, mechanization, of, crop, production, has, brought, about, a, great, decrease, in, the, number, of, agricultural, workers, needed, in, europe, traditional, family, farms, are, giving, way, to, larger, production, units, in, australia, some, farms, are, very, large, because, the, land, is, unable, to, support, a, high, stocking, density, of, livestock, because, of, climatic, conditions, in, less, developed, countries, small, farms, are, the, norm, and, the, majority, of, rural, residents, are, subsistence, farmers, feeding, their, families, and, selling, any, surplus, products, in, the, local, market, the, word, in, the, sense, of, an, agricultural, land, holding, derives, from, the, verb, to, farm, a, revenue, source, whether, taxes, customs, rents, of, a, group, of, manors, or, simply, to, hold, an, individual, manor, by, the, feudal, land, tenure, of, fee, farm, the, word, is, from, the, medieval, latin, noun, firma, also, the, source, of, the, french, word, ferme, meaning, a, fixed, agreement, contract, from, the, classical, latin, adjective, firmus, meaning, strong, stout, firm, as, in, the, medieval, age, virtually, all, manors, were, engaged, in, the, business, of, agriculture, which, was, their, principal, revenue, source, so, to, hold, a, manor, by, the, tenure, of, fee, farm, became, synonymous, with, the, practice, of, agriculture, itself, farming, has, been, innovated, at, multiple, different, points, and, places, in, human, history, the, transition, from, hunter, gatherer, to, settled, agricultural, societies, is, called, the, neolithic, revolution, and, first, began, around, 12, 000, years, ago, near, the, beginning, of, the, geological, epoch, of, the, holocene, around, 12, 000, years, ago, it, was, the, world, s, first, historically, verifiable, revolution, in, agriculture, farming, spread, from, the, middle, east, to, europe, and, by, 4, 000, bc, people, that, lived, in, the, central, part, of, europe, were, using, oxen, to, pull, plows, and, wagons, subsequent, step, changes, in, human, farming, practices, were, provoked, by, the, british, agricultural, revolution, in, the, 18th, century, and, the, green, revolution, of, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, farming, originated, independently, in, different, parts, of, the, world, as, hunter, gatherer, societies, transitioned, to, food, production, rather, than, food, capture, it, may, have, started, about, 12, 000, years, ago, with, the, domestication, of, livestock, in, the, fertile, crescent, in, western, asia, soon, to, be, followed, by, the, cultivation, of, crops, modern, units, tend, to, specialize, in, the, crops, or, livestock, best, suited, to, the, region, with, their, finished, products, being, sold, for, the, retail, market, or, for, further, processing, with, farm, products, being, traded, around, the, world, a, farm, may, be, owned, and, operated, by, a, single, individual, family, community, corporation, or, a, company, may, produce, one, or, many, types, of, produce, and, can, be, a, holding, of, any, size, from, a, fraction, of, a, hectare, to, several, thousand, hectares, a, farm, may, operate, under, a, monoculture, system, or, with, a, variety, of, cereal, or, arable, crops, which, may, be, separate, from, or, combined, with, raising, livestock, specialist, farms, are, often, denoted, as, such, thus, a, dairy, farm, fish, farm, poultry, farm, or, mink, farm, some, farms, may, not, use, the, word, at, all, hence, vineyard, grapes, orchard, nuts, and, other, fruit, market, garden, or, truck, farm, vegetables, and, flowers, some, farms, may, be, denoted, by, their, topographical, location, such, as, a, hill, farm, while, large, estates, growing, cash, crops, such, as, cotton, or, coffee, may, be, called, plantations, many, other, terms, are, used, to, describe, farms, to, denote, their, methods, of, production, as, in, collective, corporate, intensive, organic, or, vertical, other, farms, may, primarily, exist, for, research, or, education, such, as, an, ant, farm, and, since, farming, is, synonymous, with, mass, production, the, word, farm, may, be, used, to, describe, wind, power, generation, or, puppy, farm, farms, have, special, buildings, some, buildings, such, as, barns, may, hold, animals, there, may, be, separate, buildings, for, chickens, and, pigs, on, dairy, farms, a, milking, parlor, is, an, important, building, it, is, where, dairy, cows, are, milked, the, milk, is, kept, in, a, milking, parlor, until, a, milk, tanker, comes, to, get, it, there, are, also, special, buildings, for, keeping, grain, a, silo, is, a, tall, building, where, grains, such, as, wheat, and, oats, are, stored, farmers, also, use, small, round, metal, buildings, to, store, their, grain, these, buildings, are, called, grain, bins, dairy, farming, is, a, class, of, agriculture, where, female, cattle, goats, or, other, mammals, are, raised, for, their, milk, which, may, be, either, processed, on, site, or, transported, to, a, dairy, for, processing, and, eventual, retail, sale, there, are, many, breeds, of, cattle, that, can, be, milked, some, of, the, best, producing, ones, include, holstein, norwegian, red, kostroma, brown, swiss, and, more, in, most, western, countries, a, centralized, dairy, facility, processes, milk, and, dairy, products, such, as, cream, butter, and, cheese, in, the, united, states, these, dairies, are, usually, local, companies, while, in, the, southern, hemisphere, facilities, may, be, run, by, very, large, nationwide, or, trans, national, corporations, such, as, fonterra, dairy, farms, generally, sell, male, calves, for, veal, meat, as, dairy, breeds, are, not, normally, satisfactory, for, commercial, beef, production, many, dairy, farms, also, grow, their, own, feed, typically, including, maize, alfalfa, and, hay, this, is, fed, directly, to, the, cows, or, stored, as, silage, for, use, during, the, winter, season, additional, dietary, supplements, are, added, to, the, feed, to, improve, milk, production, poultry, farms, are, devoted, to, raising, chickens, egg, layers, or, broilers, turkeys, ducks, and, other, fowl, generally, for, meat, or, eggs, a, pig, farm, is, one, that, specializes, in, raising, pigs, or, hogs, for, bacon, ham, and, other, pork, products, they, may, be, free, range, intensive, or, both, farm, control, and, ownership, has, traditionally, been, a, key, indicator, of, status, and, power, especially, in, medieval, european, agrarian, societies, the, distribution, of, farm, ownership, has, historically, been, closely, linked, to, form, of, government, medieval, feudalism, was, essentially, a, system, that, centralized, control, of, farmland, control, of, farm, labor, and, political, power, while, the, early, american, democracy, in, which, land, ownership, was, a, prerequisite, for, voting, rights, was, built, on, relatively, easy, paths, to, individual, farm, ownership, however, the, gradual, modernization, and, mechanization, of, farming, which, greatly, increases, both, the, efficiency, and, capital, requirements, of, farming, has, led, to, increasingly, large, farms, this, has, usually, been, accompanied, by, the, decoupling, of, political, power, from, farm, ownership, in, some, societies, especially, socialist, and, communist, collective, farming, is, the, norm, with, either, government, ownership, of, the, land, or, common, ownership, by, a, local, group, especially, in, societies, without, widespread, industrialized, farming, tenant, farming, and, sharecropping, are, common, farmers, either, pay, landowners, for, the, right, to, use, farmland, or, give, up, a, portion, of, the, crops, agribusiness, is, the, industry, enterprises, and, the, field, of, study, of, value, chains, in, agriculture, and, in, the, bio, economy, in, which, case, it, is, also, called, bio, business, or, bio, enterprise, the, primary, goal, of, agribusiness, is, to, maximize, profit, while, satisfying, the, needs, of, consumers, for, products, related, to, natural, resources, such, as, biotechnology, farms, food, forestry, fisheries, fuel, and, fiber, studies, of, business, growth, and, performance, in, farming, have, found, successful, agricultural, businesses, are, cost, efficient, internally, and, operate, in, favorable, economic, political, and, physical, organic, environments, they, are, able, to, expand, and, make, profits, improve, the, productivity, of, land, labor, and, capital, and, keep, their, costs, down, to, ensure, market, price, competitiveness, agribusiness, is, not, limited, to, farming, it, encompasses, a, broader, spectrum, through, the, agribusiness, system, which, includes, input, supplies, value, addition, marketing, entrepreneurship, microfinancing, and, agricultural, extension, the, land, and, buildings, of, a, farm, are, called, the, farmstead, enterprises, where, livestock, are, raised, on, rangeland, are, called, ranches, where, livestock, are, raised, in, confinement, on, feed, produced, elsewhere, the, term, feedlot, is, usually, used, in, the, us, in, 1910, there, were, 6, 406, 000, farms, and, 10, 174, 000, family, workers, in, 2000, there, were, only, 2, 172, 000, farms, and, 2, 062, 300, family, workers, the, share, of, u, s, farms, operated, by, women, has, risen, steadily, over, recent, decades, from, 5, percent, in, 1978, to, 14, percent, by, 2007, in, the, united, states, there, are, over, three, million, migrant, and, seasonal, farmworkers, 72, are, foreign, born, 78, are, male, they, have, an, average, age, of, 36, and, average, education, of, 8, years, farmworkers, make, an, average, hourly, rate, of, 9, 10, per, hour, compared, to, an, average, of, over, 18, per, hour, for, nonfarm, labor, their, average, family, income, is, under, 20, 000, and, 23, live, in, families, with, incomes, below, the, federal, poverty, level, one, half, of, all, farmworker, families, earn, less, than, 10, 000, per, year, which, is, significantly, below, the, 2005, u, s, poverty, level, of, 19, 874, for, a, family, of, four, in, 2007, corn, acres, are, expected, to, increase, by, 15, because, of, the, high, demand, for, ethanol, both, in, and, outside, of, the, u, s, producers, are, expecting, to, plant, 90, 5, million, acres, 366, 000, km, 2, of, corn, making, it, the, largest, corn, crop, since, 1944, in, the, uk, farm, as, an, agricultural, unit, always, denotes, the, area, of, pasture, and, other, fields, together, with, its, farmhouse, farmyard, and, outbuildings, large, farms, or, groups, of, farms, under, the, same, ownership, may, be, called, an, estate, conversely, a, small, farm, surrounding, the, owner, s, dwelling, is, called, a, smallholding, and, is, generally, focused, on, self, sufficiency, with, only, the, surplus, being, sold, in, europe, traditional, family, farms, are, giving, way, to, larger, production, units, where, industrial, agriculture, and, mechanization, brings, large, crop, yields, the, common, agricultural, policy, cap, is, one, of, the, most, important, policies, of, the, european, union, and, is, helping, in, the, change, of, farms, from, traditional, family, farms, to, larger, production, units, the, policy, has, the, objectives, of, increasing, agricultural, production, providing, certainty, in, food, supplies, ensuring, a, high, quality, of, life, for, farmers, stabilizing, markets, and, ensuring, reasonable, prices, for, consumers, it, was, until, recently, operated, by, a, system, of, subsidies, and, market, intervention, until, the, 1990s, the, policy, accounted, for, over, 60, per, cent, of, the, european, union, s, annual, budget, and, as, of, 2013, accounts, for, around, 34, per, cent, according, to, the, world, bank, most, empirical, evidence, indicates, that, land, productivity, on, large, farms, in, pakistan, is, lower, than, that, of, small, farms, holding, other, factors, constant, small, farmers, have, higher, net, returns, per, hectare, than, large, farms, according, to, farm, household, income, data, nepal, is, an, agricultural, country, and, about, 80, of, the, total, population, are, engaged, in, farming, rice, is, mainly, produced, in, nepal, along, with, fruits, like, apples, dairy, farming, and, poultry, farming, are, also, growing, in, nepal, farming, is, a, significant, economic, sector, in, australia, a, farm, is, an, area, of, land, used, for, primary, production, which, will, include, buildings, according, to, the, un, green, agriculture, directs, a, greater, share, of, total, farming, input, expenditures, towards, the, purchase, of, locally, sourced, input, e, g, labour, and, organic, fertilisers, and, a, local, multiplier, effect, is, expected, to, kick, in, overall, green, farming, practices, tend, to, require, more, labour, inputs, than, conventional, farming, e, g, from, comparable, levels, to, as, much, as, 30, per, cent, more, fao, 2007, and, european, commission, 2010, creating, jobs, in, rural, areas, and, a, higher, return, on, labour, inputs, where, most, of, the, income, is, from, some, other, employment, and, the, farm, is, really, an, expanded, residence, the, term, hobby, farm, is, common, this, will, allow, sufficient, size, for, recreational, use, but, be, very, unlikely, to, produce, sufficient, income, to, be, self, sustaining, hobby, farms, are, commonly, around, 2, hectares, 4, 9, acres, but, may, be, much, larger, depending, upon, land, prices, which, vary, regionally, often, very, small, farms, used, for, intensive, primary, production, are, referred, to, by, the, specialization, they, are, being, used, for, such, as, a, dairy, rather, than, a, dairy, farm, a, piggery, a, market, garden, etc, this, also, applies, to, feedlots, which, are, specifically, developed, to, a, single, purpose, and, are, often, not, able, to, be, used, for, more, general, purpose, mixed, farming, practices, in, remote, areas, farms, can, become, quite, large, as, with, estates, in, england, there, is, no, defined, size, or, method, of, operation, at, which, a, large, farm, becomes, a, station, a, farm, in, africa, includes, various, structures, depending, on, climate, related, areas, primarily, farming, is, the, raising, and, breeding, of, grazing, livestock, such, as, cattle, sheep, ostriches, horses, or, goats, predominantly, domestic, animals, are, raised, for, their, meat, milk, skin, leather, or, fiber, wool, you, might, even, come, across, silk, farms, furthermore, there, are, plenty, of, hunting, farms, guest, farms, and, game, farms, arable, or, irrigated, land, is, often, used, for, raising, crops, such, as, feed, grains, and, hay, for, animal, feeding, on, some, farms, astro, farm, star, gazing, became, very, popular, because, of, the, excellent, optical, quality, in, the, desert, the, high, energy, stereoscopic, system, h, e, s, s, which, investigates, cosmic, gamma, rays, is, situated, on, farm, g, llschau, in, namibia, farm, equipment, has, evolved, over, the, centuries, from, simple, hand, tools, such, as, the, hoe, through, ox, or, horse, drawn, equipment, such, as, the, plough, and, harrow, to, the, modern, highly, technical, machinery, such, as, the, tractor, baler, and, combine, harvester, replacing, what, was, a, highly, labour, intensive, occupation, before, the, industrial, revolution, today, much, of, the, farm, equipment, used, on, both, small, and, large, farms, is, automated, e, g, using, satellite, guided, farming, as, new, types, of, high, tech, farm, equipment, have, become, inaccessible, to, farmers, that, historically, fixed, their, own, equipment, wired, magazine, reports, there, is, a, growing, backlash, due, mostly, to, companies, using, intellectual, property, law, to, prevent, farmers, from, having, the, legal, right, to, fix, their, equipment, or, gain, access, to, the, information, to, allow, them, to, do, it, this, has, encouraged, groups, such, as, open, source, ecology, and, farm, hack, to, begin, to, make, open, source, hardware, for, agricultural, machinery, in, addition, on, a, smaller, scale, farmbot, and, the, reprap, open, source, 3d, printer, community, has, begun, to, make, open, source, farm, tools, available, of, increasing, levels, of, sophistication
