technology, is, the, application, of, conceptual, knowledge, to, achieve, practical, goals, especially, in, a, reproducible, way, the, word, technology, can, also, mean, the, products, resulting, from, such, efforts, including, both, tangible, tools, such, as, utensils, or, machines, and, intangible, ones, such, as, software, technology, plays, a, critical, role, in, science, engineering, and, everyday, life, technological, advancements, have, led, to, significant, changes, in, society, the, earliest, known, technology, is, the, stone, tool, used, during, prehistoric, times, followed, by, the, control, of, fire, which, contributed, to, the, growth, of, the, human, brain, and, the, development, of, language, during, the, ice, age, the, invention, of, the, wheel, in, the, bronze, age, allowed, greater, travel, and, the, creation, of, more, complex, machines, more, recent, technological, inventions, including, the, printing, press, telephone, and, the, internet, have, lowered, barriers, to, communication, and, ushered, in, the, knowledge, economy, while, technology, contributes, to, economic, development, and, improves, human, prosperity, it, can, also, have, negative, impacts, like, pollution, and, resource, depletion, and, can, cause, social, harms, like, technological, unemployment, resulting, from, automation, as, a, result, philosophical, and, political, debates, about, the, role, and, use, of, technology, the, ethics, of, technology, and, ways, to, mitigate, its, downsides, are, ongoing, technology, is, a, term, dating, back, to, the, early, 17th, century, that, meant, systematic, treatment, from, greek, from, the, greek, romanized, t, khn, lit, craft, art, and, study, knowledge, it, is, predated, in, use, by, the, ancient, greek, word, t, khn, used, to, mean, knowledge, of, how, to, make, things, which, encompassed, activities, like, architecture, starting, in, the, 19th, century, continental, europeans, started, using, the, terms, technik, german, or, technique, french, to, refer, to, a, way, of, doing, which, included, all, technical, arts, such, as, dancing, navigation, or, printing, whether, or, not, they, required, tools, or, instruments, at, the, time, technologie, german, and, french, referred, either, to, the, academic, discipline, studying, the, methods, of, arts, and, crafts, or, to, the, political, discipline, intended, to, legislate, on, the, functions, of, the, arts, and, crafts, the, distinction, between, technik, and, technologie, is, absent, in, english, and, so, both, were, translated, as, technology, the, term, was, previously, uncommon, in, english, and, mostly, referred, to, the, academic, discipline, as, in, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, in, the, 20th, century, as, a, result, of, scientific, progress, and, the, second, industrial, revolution, technology, stopped, being, considered, a, distinct, academic, discipline, and, took, on, the, meaning, the, systemic, use, of, knowledge, to, practical, ends, tools, were, initially, developed, by, hominids, through, observation, and, trial, and, error, around, 2, mya, million, years, ago, they, learned, to, make, the, first, stone, tools, by, hammering, flakes, off, a, pebble, forming, a, sharp, hand, axe, this, practice, was, refined, 75, kya, thousand, years, ago, into, pressure, flaking, enabling, much, finer, work, the, discovery, of, fire, was, described, by, charles, darwin, as, possibly, the, greatest, ever, made, by, man, archaeological, dietary, and, social, evidence, point, to, continuous, fire, use, at, least, 1, 5, mya, fire, fueled, with, wood, and, charcoal, allowed, early, humans, to, cook, their, food, to, increase, its, digestibility, improving, its, nutrient, value, and, broadening, the, number, of, foods, that, could, be, eaten, the, cooking, hypothesis, proposes, that, the, ability, to, cook, promoted, an, increase, in, hominid, brain, size, though, some, researchers, find, the, evidence, inconclusive, archaeological, evidence, of, hearths, was, dated, to, 790, kya, researchers, believe, this, is, likely, to, have, intensified, human, socialization, and, may, have, contributed, to, the, emergence, of, language, other, technological, advances, made, during, the, paleolithic, era, include, clothing, and, shelter, no, consensus, exists, on, the, approximate, time, of, adoption, of, either, technology, but, archaeologists, have, found, archaeological, evidence, of, clothing, 90, 120, kya, and, shelter, 450, kya, as, the, paleolithic, era, progressed, dwellings, became, more, sophisticated, and, more, elaborate, as, early, as, 380, kya, humans, were, constructing, temporary, wood, huts, clothing, adapted, from, the, fur, and, hides, of, hunted, animals, helped, humanity, expand, into, colder, regions, humans, began, to, migrate, out, of, africa, around, 200, kya, initially, moving, to, eurasia, the, neolithic, revolution, or, first, agricultural, revolution, brought, about, an, acceleration, of, technological, innovation, and, a, consequent, increase, in, social, complexity, the, invention, of, the, polished, stone, axe, was, a, major, advance, that, allowed, large, scale, forest, clearance, and, farming, this, use, of, polished, stone, axes, increased, greatly, in, the, neolithic, but, was, originally, used, in, the, preceding, mesolithic, in, some, areas, such, as, ireland, agriculture, fed, larger, populations, and, the, transition, to, sedentism, allowed, for, the, simultaneous, raising, of, more, children, as, infants, no, longer, needed, to, be, carried, around, by, nomads, additionally, children, could, contribute, labor, to, the, raising, of, crops, more, readily, than, they, could, participate, in, hunter, gatherer, activities, with, this, increase, in, population, and, availability, of, labor, came, an, increase, in, labor, specialization, what, triggered, the, progression, from, early, neolithic, villages, to, the, first, cities, such, as, uruk, and, the, first, civilizations, such, as, sumer, is, not, specifically, known, however, the, emergence, of, increasingly, hierarchical, social, structures, and, specialized, labor, of, trade, and, war, among, adjacent, cultures, and, the, need, for, collective, action, to, overcome, environmental, challenges, such, as, irrigation, are, all, thought, to, have, played, a, role, the, invention, of, writing, led, to, the, spread, of, cultural, knowledge, and, became, the, basis, for, history, libraries, schools, and, scientific, research, continuing, improvements, led, to, the, furnace, and, bellows, and, provided, for, the, first, time, the, ability, to, smelt, and, forge, gold, copper, silver, and, lead, native, metals, found, in, relatively, pure, form, in, nature, the, advantages, of, copper, tools, over, stone, bone, and, wooden, tools, were, quickly, apparent, to, early, humans, and, native, copper, was, probably, used, from, near, the, beginning, of, neolithic, times, about, 10, kya, native, copper, does, not, naturally, occur, in, large, amounts, but, copper, ores, are, quite, common, and, some, of, them, produce, metal, easily, when, burned, in, wood, or, charcoal, fires, eventually, the, working, of, metals, led, to, the, discovery, of, alloys, such, as, bronze, and, brass, about, 4, 000, bce, the, first, use, of, iron, alloys, such, as, steel, dates, to, around, 1, 800, bce, after, harnessing, fire, humans, discovered, other, forms, of, energy, the, earliest, known, use, of, wind, power, is, the, sailing, ship, the, earliest, record, of, a, ship, under, sail, is, that, of, a, nile, boat, dating, to, around, 7, 000, bce, from, prehistoric, times, egyptians, likely, used, the, power, of, the, annual, flooding, of, the, nile, to, irrigate, their, lands, gradually, learning, to, regulate, much, of, it, through, purposely, built, irrigation, channels, and, catch, basins, the, ancient, sumerians, in, mesopotamia, used, a, complex, system, of, canals, and, levees, to, divert, water, from, the, tigris, and, euphrates, rivers, for, irrigation, archaeologists, estimate, that, the, wheel, was, invented, independently, and, concurrently, in, mesopotamia, in, present, day, iraq, the, northern, caucasus, maykop, culture, and, central, europe, time, estimates, range, from, 5, 500, to, 3, 000, bce, with, most, experts, putting, it, closer, to, 4, 000, bce, the, oldest, artifacts, with, drawings, depicting, wheeled, carts, date, from, about, 3, 500, bce, more, recently, the, oldest, known, wooden, wheel, in, the, world, as, of, 2024, was, found, in, the, ljubljana, marsh, of, slovenia, austrian, experts, have, established, that, the, wheel, is, between, 5, 100, and, 5, 350, years, old, the, invention, of, the, wheel, revolutionized, trade, and, war, it, did, not, take, long, to, discover, that, wheeled, wagons, could, be, used, to, carry, heavy, loads, the, ancient, sumerians, used, a, potter, s, wheel, and, may, have, invented, it, a, stone, pottery, wheel, found, in, the, city, state, of, ur, dates, to, around, 3, 429, bce, and, even, older, fragments, of, wheel, thrown, pottery, have, been, found, in, the, same, area, fast, rotary, potters, wheels, enabled, early, mass, production, of, pottery, but, it, was, the, use, of, the, wheel, as, a, transformer, of, energy, through, water, wheels, windmills, and, even, treadmills, that, revolutionized, the, application, of, nonhuman, power, sources, the, first, two, wheeled, carts, were, derived, from, travois, and, were, first, used, in, mesopotamia, and, iran, in, around, 3, 000, bce, the, oldest, known, constructed, roadways, are, the, stone, paved, streets, of, the, city, state, of, ur, dating, to, c, 4, 000, bce, and, timber, roads, leading, through, the, swamps, of, glastonbury, england, dating, to, around, the, same, period, the, first, long, distance, road, which, came, into, use, around, 3, 500, bce, spanned, 2, 400, km, from, the, persian, gulf, to, the, mediterranean, sea, but, was, not, paved, and, was, only, partially, maintained, in, around, 2, 000, bce, the, minoans, on, the, greek, island, of, crete, built, a, 50, km, road, leading, from, the, palace, of, gortyn, on, the, south, side, of, the, island, through, the, mountains, to, the, palace, of, knossos, on, the, north, side, of, the, island, unlike, the, earlier, road, the, minoan, road, was, completely, paved, ancient, minoan, private, homes, had, running, water, a, bathtub, virtually, identical, to, modern, ones, was, unearthed, at, the, palace, of, knossos, several, minoan, private, homes, also, had, toilets, which, could, be, flushed, by, pouring, water, down, the, drain, the, ancient, romans, had, many, public, flush, toilets, which, emptied, into, an, extensive, sewage, system, the, primary, sewer, in, rome, was, the, cloaca, maxima, construction, began, on, it, in, the, sixth, century, bce, and, it, is, still, in, use, today, the, ancient, romans, also, had, a, complex, system, of, aqueducts, which, were, used, to, transport, water, across, long, distances, the, first, roman, aqueduct, was, built, in, 312, bce, the, eleventh, and, final, ancient, roman, aqueduct, was, built, in, 226, ce, put, together, the, roman, aqueducts, extended, over, 450, km, but, less, than, 70, km, of, this, was, above, ground, and, supported, by, arches, innovations, continued, through, the, middle, ages, with, the, introduction, of, silk, production, in, asia, and, later, europe, the, horse, collar, and, horseshoes, simple, machines, such, as, the, lever, the, screw, and, the, pulley, were, combined, into, more, complicated, tools, such, as, the, wheelbarrow, windmills, and, clocks, a, system, of, universities, developed, and, spread, scientific, ideas, and, practices, including, oxford, and, cambridge, the, renaissance, era, produced, many, innovations, including, the, introduction, of, the, movable, type, printing, press, to, europe, which, facilitated, the, communication, of, knowledge, technology, became, increasingly, influenced, by, science, beginning, a, cycle, of, mutual, advancement, starting, in, the, united, kingdom, in, the, 18th, century, the, discovery, of, steam, power, set, off, the, industrial, revolution, which, saw, wide, ranging, technological, discoveries, particularly, in, the, areas, of, agriculture, manufacturing, mining, metallurgy, and, transport, and, the, widespread, application, of, the, factory, system, this, was, followed, a, century, later, by, the, second, industrial, revolution, which, led, to, rapid, scientific, discovery, standardization, and, mass, production, new, technologies, were, developed, including, sewage, systems, electricity, light, bulbs, electric, motors, railroads, automobiles, and, airplanes, these, technological, advances, led, to, significant, developments, in, medicine, chemistry, physics, and, engineering, they, were, accompanied, by, consequential, social, change, with, the, introduction, of, skyscrapers, accompanied, by, rapid, urbanization, communication, improved, with, the, invention, of, the, telegraph, the, telephone, the, radio, and, television, the, 20th, century, brought, a, host, of, innovations, in, physics, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, in, the, atomic, age, led, to, both, nuclear, weapons, and, nuclear, power, analog, computers, were, invented, and, asserted, dominance, in, processing, complex, data, while, the, invention, of, vacuum, tubes, allowed, for, digital, computing, with, computers, like, the, eniac, their, sheer, size, precluded, widespread, use, until, innovations, in, quantum, physics, allowed, for, the, invention, of, the, transistor, in, 1947, which, significantly, compacted, computers, and, led, the, digital, transition, information, technology, particularly, optical, fiber, and, optical, amplifiers, allowed, for, simple, and, fast, long, distance, communication, which, ushered, in, the, information, age, and, the, birth, of, the, internet, the, space, age, began, with, the, launch, of, sputnik, 1, in, 1957, and, later, the, launch, of, crewed, missions, to, the, moon, in, the, 1960s, organized, efforts, to, search, for, extraterrestrial, intelligence, have, used, radio, telescopes, to, detect, signs, of, technology, use, or, technosignatures, given, off, by, alien, civilizations, in, medicine, new, technologies, were, developed, for, diagnosis, ct, pet, and, mri, scanning, treatment, like, the, dialysis, machine, defibrillator, pacemaker, and, a, wide, array, of, new, pharmaceutical, drugs, and, research, like, interferon, cloning, and, dna, microarrays, complex, manufacturing, and, construction, techniques, and, organizations, are, needed, to, make, and, maintain, more, modern, technologies, and, entire, industries, have, arisen, to, develop, succeeding, generations, of, increasingly, more, complex, tools, modern, technology, increasingly, relies, on, training, and, education, their, designers, builders, maintainers, and, users, often, require, sophisticated, general, and, specific, training, moreover, these, technologies, have, become, so, complex, that, entire, fields, have, developed, to, support, them, including, engineering, medicine, and, computer, science, and, other, fields, have, become, more, complex, such, as, construction, transportation, and, architecture, technological, change, is, the, largest, cause, of, long, term, economic, growth, throughout, human, history, energy, production, was, the, main, constraint, on, economic, development, and, new, technologies, allowed, humans, to, significantly, increase, the, amount, of, available, energy, first, came, fire, which, made, edible, a, wider, variety, of, foods, and, made, it, less, physically, demanding, to, digest, them, fire, also, enabled, smelting, and, the, use, of, tin, copper, and, iron, tools, used, for, hunting, or, tradesmanship, then, came, the, agricultural, revolution, humans, no, longer, needed, to, hunt, or, gather, to, survive, and, began, to, settle, in, towns, and, cities, forming, more, complex, societies, with, militaries, and, more, organized, forms, of, religion, technologies, have, contributed, to, human, welfare, through, increased, prosperity, improved, comfort, and, quality, of, life, and, medical, progress, but, they, can, also, disrupt, existing, social, hierarchies, cause, pollution, and, harm, individuals, or, groups, recent, years, have, brought, about, a, rise, in, social, media, s, cultural, prominence, with, potential, repercussions, on, democracy, and, economic, and, social, life, early, on, the, internet, was, seen, as, a, liberation, technology, that, would, democratize, knowledge, improve, access, to, education, and, promote, democracy, modern, research, has, turned, to, investigate, the, internet, s, downsides, including, disinformation, polarization, hate, speech, and, propaganda, since, the, 1970s, technology, s, impact, on, the, environment, has, been, criticized, leading, to, a, surge, in, investment, in, solar, wind, and, other, forms, of, clean, energy, since, the, invention, of, the, wheel, technologies, have, helped, increase, humans, economic, output, past, automation, has, both, substituted, and, complemented, labor, machines, replaced, humans, at, some, lower, paying, jobs, for, example, in, agriculture, but, this, was, compensated, by, the, creation, of, new, higher, paying, jobs, studies, have, found, that, computers, did, not, create, significant, net, technological, unemployment, due, to, artificial, intelligence, being, far, more, capable, than, computers, and, still, being, in, its, infancy, it, is, not, known, whether, it, will, follow, the, same, trend, the, question, has, been, debated, at, length, among, economists, and, policymakers, a, 2017, survey, found, no, clear, consensus, among, economists, on, whether, ai, would, increase, long, term, unemployment, according, to, the, world, economic, forum, s, the, future, of, jobs, report, 2020, ai, is, predicted, to, replace, 85, million, jobs, worldwide, and, create, 97, million, new, jobs, by, 2025, from, 1990, to, 2007, a, study, in, the, u, s, by, mit, economist, daron, acemoglu, showed, that, an, addition, of, one, robot, for, every, 1, 000, workers, decreased, the, employment, to, population, ratio, by, 0, 2, or, about, 3, 3, workers, and, lowered, wages, by, 0, 42, concerns, about, technology, replacing, human, labor, however, are, long, lasting, as, us, president, lyndon, johnson, said, in, 1964, technology, is, creating, both, new, opportunities, and, new, obligations, for, us, opportunity, for, greater, productivity, and, progress, obligation, to, be, sure, that, no, workingman, no, family, must, pay, an, unjust, price, for, progress, upon, signing, the, national, commission, on, technology, automation, and, economic, progress, bill, with, the, growing, reliance, of, technology, there, have, been, security, and, privacy, concerns, along, with, it, billions, of, people, use, different, online, payment, methods, such, as, wechat, pay, paypal, alipay, and, much, more, to, help, transfer, money, although, security, measures, are, placed, some, criminals, are, able, to, bypass, them, in, march, 2022, north, korea, used, blender, io, a, mixer, which, helped, them, to, hide, their, cryptocurrency, exchanges, to, launder, over, 20, 5, million, in, cryptocurrency, from, axie, infinity, and, steal, over, 600, million, worth, of, cryptocurrency, from, the, game, s, owner, because, of, this, the, u, s, treasury, department, sanctioned, blender, io, which, marked, the, first, time, it, has, taken, action, against, a, mixer, to, try, and, crack, down, on, north, korean, hackers, the, privacy, of, cryptocurrency, has, been, debated, although, many, customers, like, the, privacy, of, cryptocurrency, many, also, argue, that, it, needs, more, transparency, and, stability, technology, has, impacted, the, world, with, negative, and, positive, environmental, impacts, which, are, usually, the, reverse, of, the, initial, damage, such, as, the, creation, of, pollution, and, the, attempt, to, undo, said, pollution, deforestation, and, the, reversing, of, deforestation, and, oil, spills, all, of, these, have, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, environment, of, the, earth, as, technology, has, advanced, so, has, the, negative, environmental, impact, with, the, releasing, of, greenhouse, gases, like, methane, and, carbon, dioxide, into, the, atmosphere, causing, the, greenhouse, effect, gradually, heating, the, earth, and, causing, global, warming, all, of, this, has, become, worse, with, the, advancement, of, technology, pollution, the, presence, of, contaminants, in, an, environment, that, causes, adverse, effects, could, have, been, present, as, early, as, the, inca, empire, they, used, a, lead, sulfide, flux, in, the, smelting, of, ores, along, with, the, use, of, a, wind, drafted, clay, kiln, which, released, lead, into, the, atmosphere, and, the, sediment, of, rivers, philosophy, of, technology, is, a, branch, of, philosophy, that, studies, the, practice, of, designing, and, creating, artifacts, and, the, nature, of, the, things, so, created, it, emerged, as, a, discipline, over, the, past, two, centuries, and, has, grown, considerably, since, the, 1970s, the, humanities, philosophy, of, technology, is, concerned, with, the, meaning, of, technology, for, and, its, impact, on, society, and, culture, initially, technology, was, seen, as, an, extension, of, the, human, organism, that, replicated, or, amplified, bodily, and, mental, faculties, marx, framed, it, as, a, tool, used, by, capitalists, to, oppress, the, proletariat, but, believed, that, technology, would, be, a, fundamentally, liberating, force, once, it, was, freed, from, societal, deformations, second, wave, philosophers, like, ortega, later, shifted, their, focus, from, economics, and, politics, to, daily, life, and, living, in, a, techno, material, culture, arguing, that, technology, could, oppress, even, the, members, of, the, bourgeoisie, who, were, its, ostensible, masters, and, possessors, third, stage, philosophers, like, don, ihde, and, albert, borgmann, represent, a, turn, toward, de, generalization, and, empiricism, and, considered, how, humans, can, learn, to, live, with, technology, early, scholarship, on, technology, was, split, between, two, arguments, technological, determinism, and, social, construction, technological, determinism, is, the, idea, that, technologies, cause, unavoidable, social, changes, 95, it, usually, encompasses, a, related, argument, technological, autonomy, which, asserts, that, technological, progress, follows, a, natural, progression, and, cannot, be, prevented, social, constructivists, argue, that, technologies, follow, no, natural, progression, and, are, shaped, by, cultural, values, laws, politics, and, economic, incentives, modern, scholarship, has, shifted, towards, an, analysis, of, sociotechnical, systems, assemblages, of, things, people, practices, and, meanings, looking, at, the, value, judgments, that, shape, technology, cultural, critic, neil, postman, distinguished, tool, using, societies, from, technological, societies, and, from, what, he, called, technopolies, societies, that, are, dominated, by, an, ideology, of, technological, and, scientific, progress, to, the, detriment, of, other, cultural, practices, values, and, world, views, herbert, marcuse, and, john, zerzan, suggest, that, technological, society, will, inevitably, deprive, us, of, our, freedom, and, psychological, health, the, ethics, of, technology, is, an, interdisciplinary, subfield, of, ethics, that, analyzes, technology, s, ethical, implications, and, explores, ways, to, mitigate, the, potential, negative, impacts, of, new, technologies, there, is, a, broad, range, of, ethical, issues, revolving, around, technology, from, specific, areas, of, focus, affecting, professionals, working, with, technology, to, broader, social, ethical, and, legal, issues, concerning, the, role, of, technology, in, society, and, everyday, life, prominent, debates, have, surrounded, genetically, modified, organisms, the, use, of, robotic, soldiers, algorithmic, bias, and, the, issue, of, aligning, ai, behavior, with, human, values, technology, ethics, encompasses, several, key, fields, bioethics, looks, at, ethical, issues, surrounding, biotechnologies, and, modern, medicine, including, cloning, human, genetic, engineering, and, stem, cell, research, computer, ethics, focuses, on, issues, related, to, computing, cyberethics, explores, internet, related, issues, like, intellectual, property, rights, privacy, and, censorship, nanoethics, examines, issues, surrounding, the, alteration, of, matter, at, the, atomic, and, molecular, level, in, various, disciplines, including, computer, science, engineering, and, biology, and, engineering, ethics, deals, with, the, professional, standards, of, engineers, including, software, engineers, and, their, moral, responsibilities, to, the, public, a, wide, branch, of, technology, ethics, is, concerned, with, the, ethics, of, artificial, intelligence, it, includes, robot, ethics, which, deals, with, ethical, issues, involved, in, the, design, construction, use, and, treatment, of, robots, as, well, as, machine, ethics, which, is, concerned, with, ensuring, the, ethical, behavior, of, artificially, intelligent, agents, within, the, field, of, ai, ethics, significant, yet, unsolved, research, problems, include, ai, alignment, ensuring, that, ai, behaviors, are, aligned, with, their, creators, intended, goals, and, interests, and, the, reduction, of, algorithmic, bias, some, researchers, have, warned, against, the, hypothetical, risk, of, an, ai, takeover, and, have, advocated, for, the, use, of, ai, capability, control, in, addition, to, ai, alignment, methods, other, fields, of, ethics, have, had, to, contend, with, technology, related, issues, including, military, ethics, media, ethics, and, educational, ethics, futures, studies, is, the, systematic, and, interdisciplinary, study, of, social, and, technological, progress, it, aims, to, quantitatively, and, qualitatively, explore, the, range, of, plausible, futures, and, to, incorporate, human, values, in, the, development, of, new, technologies, 54, more, generally, futures, researchers, are, interested, in, improving, the, freedom, and, welfare, of, humankind, 73, it, relies, on, a, thorough, quantitative, and, qualitative, analysis, of, past, and, present, technological, trends, and, attempts, to, rigorously, extrapolate, them, into, the, future, science, fiction, is, often, used, as, a, source, of, ideas, 173, futures, research, methodologies, include, survey, research, modeling, statistical, analysis, and, computer, simulations, 187, existential, risk, researchers, analyze, risks, that, could, lead, to, human, extinction, or, civilizational, collapse, and, look, for, ways, to, build, resilience, against, them, relevant, research, centers, include, the, cambridge, center, for, the, study, of, existential, risk, and, the, stanford, existential, risk, initiative, future, technologies, may, contribute, to, the, risks, of, artificial, general, intelligence, biological, warfare, nuclear, warfare, nanotechnology, anthropogenic, climate, change, global, warming, or, stable, global, totalitarianism, though, technologies, may, also, help, us, mitigate, asteroid, impacts, and, gamma, ray, bursts, in, 2019, philosopher, nick, bostrom, introduced, the, notion, of, a, vulnerable, world, one, in, which, there, is, some, level, of, technological, development, at, which, civilization, almost, certainly, gets, devastated, by, default, citing, the, risks, of, a, pandemic, caused, by, bioterrorists, or, an, arms, race, triggered, by, the, development, of, novel, armaments, and, the, loss, of, mutual, assured, destruction, he, invites, policymakers, to, question, the, assumptions, that, technological, progress, is, always, beneficial, that, scientific, openness, is, always, preferable, or, that, they, can, afford, to, wait, until, a, dangerous, technology, has, been, invented, before, they, prepare, mitigations, emerging, technologies, are, novel, technologies, whose, development, or, practical, applications, are, still, largely, unrealized, they, include, nanotechnology, biotechnology, robotics, 3d, printing, blockchains, and, artificial, intelligence, in, 2005, futurist, ray, kurzweil, claimed, the, next, technological, revolution, would, rest, upon, advances, in, genetics, nanotechnology, and, robotics, with, robotics, being, the, most, impactful, of, the, three, technologies, genetic, engineering, will, allow, far, greater, control, over, human, biological, nature, through, a, process, called, directed, evolution, some, thinkers, believe, that, this, may, shatter, our, sense, of, self, and, have, urged, for, renewed, public, debate, exploring, the, issue, more, thoroughly, others, fear, that, directed, evolution, could, lead, to, eugenics, or, extreme, social, inequality, nanotechnology, will, grant, us, the, ability, to, manipulate, matter, at, the, molecular, and, atomic, scale, which, could, allow, us, to, reshape, ourselves, and, our, environment, in, fundamental, ways, nanobots, could, be, used, within, the, human, body, to, destroy, cancer, cells, or, form, new, body, parts, blurring, the, line, between, biology, and, technology, autonomous, robots, have, undergone, rapid, progress, and, are, expected, to, replace, humans, at, many, dangerous, tasks, including, search, and, rescue, bomb, disposal, firefighting, and, war, estimates, on, the, advent, of, artificial, general, intelligence, vary, but, half, of, machine, learning, experts, surveyed, in, 2018, believe, that, ai, will, accomplish, every, task, better, and, more, cheaply, than, humans, by, 2063, and, automate, all, human, jobs, by, 2140, this, expected, technological, unemployment, has, led, to, calls, for, increased, emphasis, on, computer, science, education, and, debates, about, universal, basic, income, political, science, experts, predict, that, this, could, lead, to, a, rise, in, extremism, while, others, see, it, as, an, opportunity, to, usher, in, a, post, scarcity, economy, some, segments, of, the, 1960s, hippie, counterculture, grew, to, dislike, urban, living, and, developed, a, preference, for, locally, autonomous, sustainable, and, decentralized, technology, termed, appropriate, technology, this, later, influenced, hacker, culture, and, technopaganism, technological, utopianism, refers, to, the, belief, that, technological, development, is, a, moral, good, which, can, and, should, bring, about, a, utopia, that, is, a, society, in, which, laws, governments, and, social, conditions, serve, the, needs, of, all, its, citizens, examples, of, techno, utopian, goals, include, post, scarcity, economics, life, extension, mind, uploading, cryonics, and, the, creation, of, artificial, superintelligence, major, techno, utopian, movements, include, transhumanism, and, singularitarianism, the, transhumanism, movement, is, founded, upon, the, continued, evolution, of, human, life, beyond, its, current, human, form, through, science, and, technology, informed, by, life, promoting, principles, and, values, the, movement, gained, wider, popularity, in, the, early, 21st, century, singularitarians, believe, that, machine, superintelligence, will, accelerate, technological, progress, by, orders, of, magnitude, and, create, even, more, intelligent, entities, ever, faster, which, may, lead, to, a, pace, of, societal, and, technological, change, that, is, incomprehensible, to, us, this, event, horizon, is, known, as, the, technological, singularity, major, figures, of, techno, utopianism, include, ray, kurzweil, and, nick, bostrom, techno, utopianism, has, attracted, both, praise, and, criticism, from, progressive, religious, and, conservative, thinkers, technology, s, central, role, in, our, lives, has, drawn, concerns, and, backlash, the, backlash, against, technology, is, not, a, uniform, movement, and, encompasses, many, heterogeneous, ideologies, the, earliest, known, revolt, against, technology, was, luddism, a, pushback, against, early, automation, in, textile, production, automation, had, resulted, in, a, need, for, fewer, workers, a, process, known, as, technological, unemployment, between, the, 1970s, and, 1990s, american, terrorist, ted, kaczynski, carried, out, a, series, of, bombings, across, america, and, published, the, unabomber, manifesto, denouncing, technology, s, negative, impacts, on, nature, and, human, freedom, the, essay, resonated, with, a, large, part, of, the, american, public, it, was, partly, inspired, by, jacques, ellul, s, the, technological, society, some, subcultures, like, the, off, the, grid, movement, advocate, a, withdrawal, from, technology, and, a, return, to, nature, the, ecovillage, movement, seeks, to, reestablish, harmony, between, technology, and, nature, engineering, is, the, process, by, which, technology, is, developed, it, often, requires, problem, solving, under, strict, constraints, technological, development, is, action, oriented, while, scientific, knowledge, is, fundamentally, explanatory, polish, philosopher, henryk, skolimowski, framed, it, like, so, science, concerns, itself, with, what, is, technology, with, what, is, to, be, 375, the, direction, of, causality, between, scientific, discovery, and, technological, innovation, has, been, debated, by, scientists, philosophers, and, policymakers, because, innovation, is, often, undertaken, at, the, edge, of, scientific, knowledge, most, technologies, are, not, derived, from, scientific, knowledge, but, instead, from, engineering, tinkering, and, chance, 217, 240, for, example, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, when, knowledge, of, turbulent, combustion, or, fluid, dynamics, was, still, crude, jet, engines, were, invented, through, running, the, device, to, destruction, analyzing, what, broke, and, repeating, the, process, scientific, explanations, often, follow, technological, developments, rather, than, preceding, them, 217, 240, many, discoveries, also, arose, from, pure, chance, like, the, discovery, of, penicillin, as, a, result, of, accidental, lab, contamination, since, the, 1960s, the, assumption, that, government, funding, of, basic, research, would, lead, to, the, discovery, of, marketable, technologies, has, lost, credibility, probabilist, nassim, taleb, argues, that, national, research, programs, that, implement, the, notions, of, serendipity, and, convexity, through, frequent, trial, and, error, are, more, likely, to, lead, to, useful, innovations, than, research, that, aims, to, reach, specific, outcomes, despite, this, modern, technology, is, increasingly, reliant, on, deep, domain, specific, scientific, knowledge, in, 1975, there, was, an, average, of, one, citation, of, scientific, literature, in, every, three, patents, granted, in, the, u, s, by, 1989, this, increased, to, an, average, of, one, citation, per, patent, the, average, was, skewed, upwards, by, patents, related, to, the, pharmaceutical, industry, chemistry, and, electronics, a, 2021, analysis, shows, that, patents, that, are, based, on, scientific, discoveries, are, on, average, 26, more, valuable, than, equivalent, non, science, based, patents, the, use, of, basic, technology, is, also, a, feature, of, non, human, animal, species, tool, use, was, once, considered, a, defining, characteristic, of, the, genus, homo, this, view, was, supplanted, after, discovering, evidence, of, tool, use, among, chimpanzees, and, other, primates, dolphins, and, crows, for, example, researchers, have, observed, wild, chimpanzees, using, basic, foraging, tools, pestles, levers, using, leaves, as, sponges, and, tree, bark, or, vines, as, probes, to, fish, termites, west, african, chimpanzees, use, stone, hammers, and, anvils, for, cracking, nuts, as, do, capuchin, monkeys, of, boa, vista, brazil, tool, use, is, not, the, only, form, of, animal, technology, use, for, example, beaver, dams, built, with, wooden, sticks, or, large, stones, are, a, technology, with, dramatic, impacts, on, river, habitats, and, ecosystems, the, relationship, of, humanity, with, technology, has, been, explored, in, science, fiction, literature, for, example, in, brave, new, world, a, clockwork, orange, nineteen, eighty, four, isaac, asimov, s, essays, and, movies, like, minority, report, total, recall, gattaca, and, inception, it, has, spawned, the, dystopian, and, futuristic, cyberpunk, genre, which, juxtaposes, futuristic, technology, with, societal, collapse, dystopia, or, decay, notable, cyberpunk, works, include, william, gibson, s, neuromancer, novel, and, movies, like, blade, runner, and, the, matrix
