waste, or, wastes, are, unwanted, or, unusable, materials, waste, is, any, substance, discarded, after, primary, use, or, is, worthless, defective, and, of, no, use, a, by, product, by, contrast, is, a, joint, product, of, relatively, minor, economic, value, a, waste, product, may, become, a, by, product, joint, product, or, resource, through, an, invention, that, raises, a, waste, product, s, value, above, zero, examples, include, municipal, solid, waste, household, trash, refuse, hazardous, waste, wastewater, such, as, sewage, which, contains, bodily, wastes, feces, and, urine, and, surface, runoff, radioactive, waste, and, others, what, constitutes, waste, depends, on, the, eye, of, the, beholder, one, person, s, waste, can, be, a, resource, for, another, person, though, waste, is, a, physical, object, its, generation, is, a, physical, and, psychological, process, the, definitions, used, by, various, agencies, are, as, below, according, to, the, basel, convention, on, the, control, of, transboundary, movements, of, hazardous, wastes, and, their, disposal, of, 1989, art, 2, 1, wastes, are, substance, or, objects, which, are, disposed, of, or, are, intended, to, be, disposed, of, or, are, required, to, be, disposed, of, by, the, provisions, of, national, law, the, unsd, glossary, of, environment, statistics, describes, waste, as, materials, that, are, not, prime, products, that, is, products, produced, for, the, market, for, which, the, generator, has, no, further, use, in, terms, of, his, her, own, purposes, of, production, transformation, or, consumption, and, of, which, he, she, wants, to, dispose, wastes, may, be, generated, during, the, extraction, of, raw, materials, the, processing, of, raw, materials, into, intermediate, and, final, products, the, consumption, of, final, products, and, other, human, activities, residuals, recycled, or, reused, at, the, place, of, generation, are, excluded, under, the, waste, framework, directive, 2008, 98, ec, art, 3, 1, the, european, union, defines, waste, as, an, object, the, holder, discards, intends, to, discard, or, is, required, to, discard, for, a, more, structural, description, of, the, waste, directive, see, the, european, commission, s, summary, metabolic, wastes, or, excrements, are, substances, left, over, from, metabolic, processes, such, as, cellular, respiration, which, cannot, be, used, by, the, organism, they, are, surplus, or, toxic, and, must, therefore, be, excreted, this, includes, nitrogen, compounds, water, co, 2, phosphates, sulphates, etc, animals, treat, these, compounds, as, excretes, plants, have, metabolic, pathways, which, transforms, some, of, them, primarily, the, oxygen, compounds, into, useful, substances, the, organization, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, also, known, as, oecd, defines, municipal, solid, waste, msw, as, waste, collected, and, treated, by, or, for, municipalities, typically, this, type, of, waste, includes, household, waste, commercial, waste, and, demolition, or, construction, waste, in, 2018, the, environmental, protection, agency, concluded, that, 292, 4, tons, of, municipal, waste, was, generated, which, equated, to, about, 4, 9, pounds, per, day, per, person, out, of, the, 292, 4, tons, approximately, 69, million, tons, were, recycled, and, 25, million, tons, were, composted, household, waste, more, commonly, known, as, trash, or, garbage, are, items, that, are, typically, thrown, away, daily, from, ordinary, households, items, often, included, in, this, category, include, product, packaging, yard, waste, clothing, food, scraps, appliance, paints, and, batteries, most, of, the, items, that, are, collected, by, municipalities, end, up, in, landfills, across, the, world, in, the, united, states, it, is, estimated, that, 11, 3, million, tons, of, textile, waste, is, generated, on, an, individual, level, it, is, estimated, that, the, average, american, throws, away, 81, 5, pounds, of, clothes, each, year, as, online, shopping, becomes, more, prevalent, items, such, as, cardboard, bubble, wrap, shipping, envelopes, are, ending, up, in, landfills, across, the, united, states, the, epa, has, estimated, that, approximately, 10, 1, million, tons, of, plastic, containers, and, packaging, ended, up, landfills, in, 2018, the, epa, noted, that, only, 30, 5, of, plastic, containers, and, packaging, was, recycled, or, combusted, as, an, energy, source, additionally, approximately, 940, 000, pounds, of, cardboard, ends, up, in, the, landfill, each, year, commercial, waste, is, very, similar, to, household, waste, to, be, considered, as, commercial, waste, it, must, come, from, a, business, or, commercial, occupancy, this, can, be, restaurants, retail, occupants, manufacturing, occupants, or, similar, businesses, typically, commercial, waste, contains, similar, items, such, as, food, scraps, cardboard, paper, and, shipping, materials, generally, speaking, commercial, waste, creates, more, waste, than, household, waste, on, a, per, location, basis, the, epa, defines, this, type, of, waste, as, construction, and, demolition, c, d, debris, is, a, type, of, waste, that, is, not, included, in, municipal, solid, waste, msw, items, typically, found, in, c, d, include, but, are, not, limited, to, steel, wood, products, drywall, and, plaster, brick, and, clay, tile, asphalt, shingles, concrete, and, asphalt, generally, speaking, construction, and, demolition, waste, can, be, categorized, as, any, components, needed, to, build, infrastructures, in, 2018, the, epa, estimated, that, the, us, generated, approximately, 600, million, tons, of, c, d, waste, the, waste, generated, by, construction, and, demolition, is, often, intended, to, be, reused, or, is, sent, to, the, landfill, examples, of, reused, waste, is, milled, asphalt, can, be, used, again, for, the, asphalt, mixture, or, fill, dirt, can, be, used, to, level, grade, the, epa, defines, hazardous, waste, as, a, waste, with, properties, that, make, it, dangerous, or, capable, of, having, a, harmful, effect, on, human, health, or, the, environment, hazardous, waste, falls, under, the, resource, conservation, and, recovery, act, rcra, under, the, rcra, the, epa, has, the, authority, to, control, hazardous, waste, during, its, entire, lifecycle, this, means, from, the, point, of, creation, to, the, point, where, it, has, been, properly, disposed, of, the, life, cycle, of, hazardous, waste, includes, generation, transportation, treatment, and, storage, and, disposal, all, of, which, are, included, in, the, rcra, some, forms, of, hazardous, waste, include, radioactive, waste, explosive, waste, and, electronic, waste, radioactive, waste, often, referred, to, as, nuclear, waste, is, produced, by, various, industries, such, as, nuclear, power, plants, nuclear, reactors, hospitals, research, centers, and, mining, facilities, any, activity, that, involves, radioactive, material, can, generate, radioactive, waste, furthermore, such, waste, emits, radioactive, particles, which, if, not, handled, correctly, can, be, both, an, environmental, hazard, as, well, as, a, human, health, hazard, when, dealing, with, radioactive, waste, it, is, extremely, important, to, understand, the, necessary, protocols, and, follow, the, correct, precautions, failure, to, handle, and, recycle, these, materials, can, have, catastrophic, consequences, and, potentially, damage, the, site, s, ecosystems, for, years, to, come, radioactive, waste, is, monitored, and, regulated, by, multiple, governmental, agencies, such, as, nuclear, regulatory, commission, nrc, department, of, energy, doe, environmental, protection, agency, epa, department, of, transportation, dot, and, department, of, the, interior, doi, each, agency, plays, an, important, role, in, creating, handling, and, properly, disposing, of, radioactive, waste, a, brief, description, of, each, agency, s, role, can, be, found, below, nrc, licenses, and, regulates, the, receipt, and, possession, of, high, level, waste, at, privately, owned, facilities, and, at, certain, doe, facilities, doe, plans, and, carries, out, programs, for, sand, handling, of, doe, generated, radioactive, wastes, develops, waste, disposal, technologies, and, will, design, construct, and, operate, disposal, facilities, for, doe, generated, and, commercial, high, level, wastes, epa, develops, environmental, standards, and, federal, radiation, protection, guidance, for, offsite, radiation, due, to, the, disposal, of, spent, nuclear, fuel, and, high, level, and, transuranic, radioactive, wastes, dot, regulates, both, the, packaging, and, carriage, of, all, hazardous, materials, including, radioactive, waste, doi, through, the, u, s, geological, survey, conducts, laboratory, and, field, geologic, investigations, in, support, of, doe, s, waste, disposal, programs, and, collaborates, with, doe, on, earth, science, technical, activities, the, us, currently, defines, five, types, of, radioactive, waste, as, shown, below, high, level, waste, this, type, of, radioactive, waste, is, generated, from, nuclear, reactors, or, reprocessing, spent, nuclear, fuel, transuranic, waste, this, type, of, radioactive, waste, is, man, made, and, has, an, atomic, number, of, 92, or, higher, uranium, or, thorium, mill, tailings, this, type, of, radioactive, waste, is, a, result, after, the, mining, or, milling, or, uranium, or, thorium, ore, low, level, waste, this, type, of, radioactive, waste, is, radioactively, contaminated, waste, it, is, typically, generated, from, industrial, processes, or, research, examples, of, these, items, include, paper, protective, clothing, bags, and, cardboard, technologically, enhanced, naturally, occurring, radioactive, material, tenorm, this, type, of, radioactive, waste, is, created, through, human, activity, such, as, mining, oil, and, gas, drilling, and, water, treatment, where, naturally, occurring, radiological, material, norm, becomes, concentrated, the, epa, defines, energetic, hazardous, waste, as, wastes, that, have, the, potential, to, detonate, and, bulk, military, propellants, which, cannot, safely, be, disposed, of, through, other, modes, of, treatments, the, items, which, typically, fall, under, this, category, include, munitions, fireworks, flares, hobby, rockets, and, automobile, propellants, munitions, were, added, to, hazardous, waste, in, 1997, when, the, epa, finalized, rcra, a, special, rule, was, added, to, address, munitions, in, waste, this, new, rule, is, commonly, referred, to, as, the, military, munitions, rule, the, epa, defines, military, munitions, as, all, types, of, both, conventional, and, chemical, ammunition, products, and, their, components, produced, by, or, for, the, military, for, national, defense, and, security, including, munitions, produced, by, other, parties, under, contract, to, or, acting, as, an, agent, for, dod, in, the, case, of, government, owned, contractor, operated, operations, the, entire, rule, can, be, found, here, while, a, large, percentage, of, munitions, waste, is, generated, by, the, government, or, governmental, contractors, residents, also, throw, away, expired, or, faulty, ammunition, inside, their, household, waste, every, year, the, us, generates, this, type, of, waste, from, both, the, commercial, and, consumer, aspects, this, waste, is, often, generated, from, fireworks, signal, flares, and, hobby, rockets, which, have, been, damaged, failed, to, operate, or, for, other, reasons, due, to, their, chemical, properties, these, types, of, devices, are, extremely, dangerous, while, automobile, airbag, propellants, are, not, as, common, as, munitions, and, fireworks, they, share, similar, properties, which, makes, them, extremely, hazardous, airbag, propellants, characteristics, of, reactivity, and, ignitability, are, the, characteristics, which, qualify, for, hazardous, waste, when, disposed, undeployed, leaves, these, two, hazardous, characteristics, intact, to, properly, dispose, of, these, items, they, must, be, safely, deployed, which, removes, these, hazardous, characteristics, the, epa, includes, the, waste, of, automobile, airbag, propellants, under, the, rcra, in, 2018, the, epa, issued, a, final, rule, on, handling, of, automobile, airbag, propellants, the, interim, final, rule, provides, an, exemption, of, entities, which, install, and, remove, airbags, this, includes, automobile, dealerships, salvage, yards, automobile, repair, facilities, and, collision, centers, the, handler, and, transporter, are, exempt, from, rcra, but, the, airbag, waste, collection, facility, is, not, exempt, once, the, airbags, have, met, the, collection, center, it, will, then, be, classified, as, rcra, hazardous, waste, and, must, be, disposed, or, recycled, at, a, rcra, disposal, facility, electronic, waste, often, referred, to, as, e, waste, or, e, scrap, are, often, thrown, away, or, sent, to, a, recycler, e, waste, continues, to, end, up, in, landfills, across, the, world, the, epa, estimates, that, in, 2009, 2, 37, million, tons, of, televisions, computers, cell, phones, printers, scanners, and, fax, machines, were, discarded, by, us, consumers, only, 25, of, these, devices, were, recycled, the, remainder, ended, up, in, landfills, across, the, us, e, waste, contains, many, elements, that, can, be, recycled, or, re, used, typically, speaking, electronics, are, encased, in, a, plastic, or, light, metal, enclosure, items, such, as, computer, boards, wiring, capacitors, and, small, motor, items, are, common, types, of, e, waste, of, these, items, the, internal, components, include, iron, gold, palladium, platinum, and, copper, all, of, which, are, mined, from, the, earth, it, requires, energy, to, operate, the, equipment, to, mine, these, metals, which, emits, greenhouse, gases, into, the, atmosphere, donating, e, waste, to, recycling, centers, or, refurbishing, this, equipment, can, reduce, the, greenhouse, gases, emitted, through, the, mining, process, as, well, as, decrease, the, use, of, natural, resources, to, ensure, future, generations, will, have, sufficient, access, to, these, resources, as, this, issue, continued, to, grow, president, obama, established, the, interagency, task, force, on, electronics, stewardship, in, november, 2010, the, overall, goal, for, this, task, was, to, develop, a, national, strategy, for, handling, and, proper, disposal, of, electronic, waste, the, task, force, would, work, with, the, white, house, council, on, environmental, quality, ceq, epa, and, the, us, general, services, administration, gsa, the, task, force, released, its, final, product, the, national, strategy, for, electronics, stewardship, report, the, report, focuses, on, four, goals, of, the, federal, government, s, plan, to, enhance, the, management, of, electronics, 1, incentivizing, greener, design, of, electronics, 2, leading, by, example, 3, increasing, domestic, recycling, 4, reducing, harmful, exports, of, e, waste, and, building, capacity, in, developing, countries, e, waste, is, not, only, a, problem, in, the, us, but, also, a, global, issue, tackling, this, issue, requires, collaboration, from, multiple, agencies, across, the, world, some, agencies, involved, in, this, include, u, s, epa, taiwan, environmental, protection, administration, taiwan, epa, international, e, waste, management, network, iemn, and, environmental, offices, from, asia, latin, america, the, caribbean, africa, and, north, america, mixed, waste, is, a, term, that, has, different, definitions, based, its, context, most, commonly, mixed, waste, refers, to, hazardous, waste, which, contains, radioactive, material, in, this, context, the, management, of, mixed, waste, is, regulated, by, the, epa, and, rcra, and, atomic, energy, act, the, hazardous, materials, content, is, regulated, by, rcra, while, the, radiological, component, is, regulated, by, the, department, of, energy, doe, and, nuclear, regulatory, commission, nrc, mixed, waste, can, also, be, defined, as, a, type, of, waste, which, includes, recyclable, materials, and, organic, materials, some, examples, of, mixed, waste, in, this, context, include, a, combination, of, broken, glassware, floor, sweepings, non, repairable, household, goods, non, recyclable, plastic, and, metal, and, clothing, and, furnishings, additionally, ashes, and, soot, residential, renovation, waste, materials, are, also, included, under, this, definition, this, type, of, waste, is, typically, generated, from, hospitals, physicians, offices, dental, practices, blood, banks, veterinary, offices, and, research, facilities, this, waste, has, often, been, contaminated, with, bodily, fluids, from, humans, or, animals, examples, of, this, type, of, contamination, can, include, blood, vomit, urine, and, other, bodily, fluids, concerns, started, to, generate, when, medical, waste, was, appearing, on, east, coast, beaches, in, the, 1980, s, this, forced, congress, to, pass, the, medical, waste, tracking, act, this, act, was, only, in, effect, for, approximately, 3, years, after, the, epa, concluded, the, disease, causing, medical, waste, was, greatest, at, the, point, of, generation, and, naturally, tapers, off, after, that, point, prior, to, the, hospital, medical, infectious, waste, incinerator, hmiwi, standard, approximately, 90, of, the, infectious, waste, was, incinerated, before, 1997, due, to, the, potential, of, negatively, affect, air, quality, alternative, treatment, and, disposal, technologies, for, medical, waste, was, developed, these, new, alternatives, include, there, are, many, issues, that, surround, reporting, waste, it, is, most, commonly, measured, by, size, or, weight, and, there, is, a, stark, difference, between, the, two, for, example, organic, waste, is, much, heavier, when, it, is, wet, and, plastic, or, glass, bottles, can, have, different, weights, but, be, the, same, size, on, a, global, scale, it, is, difficult, to, report, waste, because, countries, have, different, definitions, of, waste, and, what, falls, into, waste, categories, as, well, as, different, ways, of, reporting, based, on, incomplete, reports, from, its, parties, the, basel, convention, estimated, 338, million, tonnes, of, waste, was, generated, in, 2001, for, the, same, year, oecd, estimated, 4, billion, tonnes, from, its, member, countries, despite, these, inconsistencies, waste, reporting, is, still, useful, on, a, small, and, large, scale, to, determine, key, causes, and, locations, and, to, find, ways, of, preventing, minimizing, recovering, treating, and, disposing, of, waste, inappropriately, managed, waste, can, attract, rodents, and, insects, which, can, harbor, gastrointestinal, parasites, yellow, fever, worms, various, diseases, and, other, conditions, for, humans, and, exposure, to, hazardous, wastes, particularly, when, they, are, burned, can, cause, various, other, diseases, including, cancers, toxic, waste, materials, can, contaminate, surface, water, groundwater, soil, and, air, which, causes, more, problems, for, humans, other, species, and, ecosystems, a, form, of, waste, disposal, involving, combustion, creates, a, significant, amount, of, greenhouse, gases, when, the, burned, waste, contains, metals, it, can, create, toxic, gases, on, the, other, hand, when, the, waste, contains, plastics, the, gases, produce, contain, co, 2, as, global, warming, and, co, 2, emissions, increase, soil, begins, to, become, a, larger, carbon, sink, and, will, become, increasingly, valuable, for, plant, life, waste, management, is, a, significant, environmental, justice, issue, many, of, the, environmental, burdens, cited, above, are, more, often, borne, by, marginalized, groups, such, as, racial, minorities, women, and, residents, of, developing, nations, nimby, not, in, my, back, yard, is, the, opposition, of, residents, to, a, proposal, for, a, new, development, because, it, is, close, to, them, however, the, need, for, expansion, and, siting, of, waste, treatment, and, disposal, facilities, is, increasing, worldwide, there, is, now, a, growing, market, in, the, transboundary, movement, of, waste, and, although, most, waste, that, flows, between, countries, goes, between, developed, nations, a, significant, amount, of, waste, is, moved, from, developed, to, developing, nations, the, economic, costs, of, managing, waste, are, high, and, are, often, paid, for, by, municipal, governments, money, can, often, be, saved, with, more, efficiently, designed, collection, routes, modifying, vehicles, and, with, public, education, environmental, policies, such, as, pay, as, you, throw, can, reduce, the, cost, of, management, and, reduce, waste, quantities, waste, recovery, that, is, recycling, reuse, can, curb, economic, costs, because, it, avoids, extracting, raw, materials, and, often, cuts, transportation, costs, economic, assessment, of, municipal, waste, management, systems, case, studies, using, a, combination, of, life, cycle, assessment, lca, and, life, cycle, costing, lcc, the, location, of, waste, treatment, and, disposal, facilities, often, reduces, property, values, due, to, noise, dust, pollution, unsightliness, and, negative, stigma, the, informal, waste, sector, consists, mostly, of, waste, pickers, who, scavenge, for, metals, glass, plastic, textiles, and, other, materials, and, then, trade, them, for, a, profit, this, sector, can, significantly, alter, or, reduce, waste, in, a, particular, system, but, other, negative, economic, effects, come, with, the, disease, poverty, exploitation, and, abuse, of, its, workers, people, in, developing, countries, suffer, from, contaminated, water, and, landfills, caused, by, unlawful, government, policies, that, allow, first, world, countries, and, companies, to, transport, their, trash, to, their, homes, and, oftentimes, near, bodies, of, water, those, same, governments, do, not, use, any, waste, trade, profits, to, create, ways, to, manage, landfills, or, clean, water, sources, photographer, kevin, mcelvaney, documents, the, world, s, biggest, e, waste, dump, called, agbogbloshie, in, accra, ghana, which, used, to, be, a, wetland, the, young, men, and, children, that, work, in, agbogbloshie, smash, devices, to, get, to, the, metals, obtain, burns, eye, damage, lung, and, back, problems, chronic, nausea, debilitating, headaches, and, respiratory, problems, and, most, workers, die, from, cancer, in, their, 20s, mcelvaney, in, mcelvaney, s, photos, kids, in, fields, burning, refrigerators, and, computers, with, blackened, hands, and, trashed, clothes, and, animals, such, as, cows, with, open, wounds, in, the, dumpsite, there, are, piles, of, waste, used, as, makeshift, bridges, over, lakes, with, metals, and, chemicals, just, seeping, into, the, water, and, groundwater, that, could, be, linked, to, homes, water, systems, the, same, unfortunate, situation, and, dumps, landfills, can, be, seen, in, similar, countries, that, are, considered, the, third, world, such, as, other, west, african, countries, and, china, many, are, advocating, for, waste, management, a, stop, to, the, waste, trade, the, creation, of, wastewater, treatment, facilities, and, providing, a, clean, and, accessible, water, source, the, health, of, all, these, people, in, landfills, and, water, are, human, necessities, rights, that, are, being, taken, away, waste, management, or, waste, disposal, includes, the, processes, and, actions, required, to, manage, waste, from, its, inception, to, its, final, disposal, this, includes, the, collection, transport, treatment, and, disposal, of, waste, together, with, monitoring, and, regulation, of, the, waste, management, process, and, waste, related, laws, technologies, and, economic, mechanisms, waste, can, either, be, solid, liquid, or, gases, and, each, type, has, different, methods, of, disposal, and, management, waste, management, deals, with, all, types, of, waste, including, industrial, biological, household, municipal, organic, biomedical, radioactive, wastes, in, some, cases, waste, can, pose, a, threat, to, human, health, health, issues, are, associated, with, the, entire, process, of, waste, management, health, issues, can, also, arise, indirectly, or, directly, directly, through, the, handling, of, solid, waste, and, indirectly, through, the, consumption, of, water, soil, and, food, waste, is, produced, by, human, activity, for, example, the, extraction, and, processing, of, raw, materials, waste, management, is, intended, to, reduce, the, adverse, effects, of, waste, on, human, health, the, environment, planetary, resources, and, aesthetics, the, aim, of, waste, management, is, to, reduce, the, dangerous, effects, of, such, waste, on, the, environment, and, human, health, a, big, part, of, waste, management, deals, with, municipal, solid, waste, which, is, created, by, industrial, commercial, and, household, activity, waste, management, practices, are, not, the, same, across, countries, developed, and, developing, nations, regions, urban, and, rural, areas, and, residential, and, industrial, sectors, can, all, take, different, approaches, proper, management, of, waste, is, important, for, building, sustainable, and, liveable, cities, but, it, remains, a, challenge, for, many, developing, countries, and, cities, a, report, found, that, effective, waste, management, is, relatively, expensive, usually, comprising, 20, 50, of, municipal, budgets, operating, this, essential, municipal, service, requires, integrated, systems, that, are, efficient, sustainable, and, socially, supported, a, large, portion, of, waste, management, practices, deal, with, municipal, solid, waste, msw, which, is, the, bulk, of, the, waste, that, is, created, by, household, industrial, and, commercial, activity, according, to, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, municipal, solid, waste, is, expected, to, reach, approximately, 3, 4, gt, by, 2050, however, policies, and, lawmaking, can, reduce, the, amount, of, waste, produced, in, different, areas, and, cities, of, the, world, measures, of, waste, management, include, measures, for, integrated, techno, economic, mechanisms, of, a, circular, economy, effective, disposal, facilities, export, and, import, control, and, optimal, sustainable, design, of, products, that, are, produced, in, the, first, systematic, review, of, the, scientific, evidence, around, global, waste, its, management, and, its, impact, on, human, health, and, life, authors, concluded, that, about, a, fourth, of, all, the, municipal, solid, terrestrial, waste, is, not, collected, and, an, additional, fourth, is, mismanaged, after, collection, often, being, burned, in, open, and, uncontrolled, fires, or, close, to, one, billion, tons, per, year, when, combined, they, also, found, that, broad, priority, areas, each, lack, a, high, quality, research, base, partly, due, to, the, absence, of, substantial, research, funding, which, motivated, scientists, often, require, electronic, waste, ewaste, includes, discarded, computer, monitors, motherboards, mobile, phones, and, chargers, compact, discs, cds, headphones, television, sets, air, conditioners, and, refrigerators, according, to, the, global, e, waste, monitor, 2017, india, generates, 2, million, tonnes, mte, of, e, waste, annually, and, ranks, fifth, among, the, e, waste, producing, countries, after, the, united, states, the, people, s, republic, of, china, japan, and, germany, wastewater, treatment, facilities, remove, pollutants, and, contaminants, physically, and, chemically, to, clean, water, to, be, returned, to, society, the, south, gippsland, water, organization, breaks, down, the, three, steps, of, waste, water, treatment, the, primary, treatment, is, to, sift, through, the, water, to, remove, large, solids, to, leave, oils, and, small, particles, in, the, water, secondary, treatment, to, dissolve, remove, oils, particles, and, micro, organisms, from, the, water, to, be, prepared, for, tertiary, treatment, to, chemically, disinfect, the, water, with, chlorine, or, with, uv, light, for, most, industrial, applications, a, 150, 000, gpd, capacity, wwts, would, cost, an, estimated, 500, 000, to, 1, 5, million, inclusive, of, all, necessary, design, engineering, equipment, installation, and, startup, with, such, a, simple, solution, that, has, been, proven, to, clean, water, to, be, reused, and, is, relatively, inexpensive, there, is, no, excuse, why, there, should, not, be, a, waste, water, treatment, facility, in, every, country, every, state, and, every, town, right, now, according, to, a, nasa, led, study, many, of, the, world, s, freshwater, sources, are, being, drained, faster, than, they, are, being, replenished, the, water, table, is, dropping, all, over, the, world, there, s, not, an, infinite, supply, of, water, there, is, a, need, to, preserve, every, resource, every, finite, water, source, that, we, do, have, left, to, maintain, our, lives, and, lifestyles, able, countries, helping, under, developed, countries, with, their, creation, of, wastewater, treatments, benefits, society, another, cost, of, not, adding, wastewater, treatments, in, countries, is, that, people, have, no, choice, but, to, clean, with, cook, with, or, drink, the, contaminated, water, which, has, caused, millions, of, cases, of, disease, and, deaths, between, 400, 000, and, 1, million, people, die, each, year, in, developing, countries, because, of, diseases, caused, by, mismanaged, waste, estimates, poverty, charity, tearfund, society, has, the, means, to, decrease, or, even, eliminate, this, way, of, death, and, save, millions, of, lives, by, providing, the, simple, human, necessity, of, clean, water, resource, recovery, is, using, wastes, as, an, input, material, to, create, valuable, products, as, new, outputs, the, aim, is, to, reduce, the, amount, of, waste, generated, thereby, reducing, the, need, for, landfill, space, and, optimising, the, values, created, from, waste, resource, recovery, delays, the, need, to, use, raw, materials, in, the, manufacturing, process, materials, found, in, municipal, solid, waste, construction, and, demolition, waste, commercial, waste, and, industrial, wastes, can, be, used, to, recover, resources, for, the, manufacturing, of, new, materials, and, products, plastic, paper, aluminium, glass, and, metal, are, examples, of, where, value, can, be, found, in, waste, resource, recovery, goes, further, than, just, the, management, of, waste, resource, recovery, is, part, of, a, circular, economy, in, which, the, extraction, of, natural, resources, and, generation, of, wastes, are, minimised, and, in, which, materials, and, products, are, designed, more, sustainably, for, durability, reuse, repairability, remanufacturing, and, recycling, life, cycle, analysis, lca, can, be, used, to, compare, the, resource, recovery, potential, of, different, treatment, technologies, energy, recovery, from, waste, is, using, non, recyclable, waste, materials, and, extracting, from, it, heat, electricity, or, energy, through, a, variety, of, processes, including, combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, and, anaerobic, digestion, this, process, is, referred, to, as, waste, to, energy, there, are, several, ways, to, recover, energy, from, waste, anaerobic, digestion, is, a, naturally, occurring, process, of, decomposition, where, organic, matter, is, reduced, to, a, simpler, chemical, component, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, incineration, or, direct, controlled, burning, of, municipal, solid, waste, reduces, waste, and, makes, energy, secondary, recovered, fuel, is, the, energy, recovery, from, waste, that, cannot, be, reused, or, recycled, from, mechanical, and, biological, treatment, activities, pyrolysis, involves, heating, of, waste, with, the, absence, of, oxygen, to, high, temperatures, to, break, down, any, carbon, content, into, a, mixture, of, gaseous, and, liquid, fuels, and, solid, residue, gasification, is, the, conversion, of, carbon, rich, material, through, high, temperature, with, partial, oxidation, into, a, gas, stream, plasma, arc, heating, is, the, very, high, heating, of, municipal, solid, waste, to, temperatures, ranging, from, 3, 000, to, 10, 000, c, where, energy, is, released, by, an, electrical, discharge, in, an, inert, atmosphere, using, waste, as, fuel, can, offer, important, environmental, benefits, it, can, provide, a, safe, and, cost, effective, option, for, wastes, that, would, normally, have, to, be, dealt, with, through, disposal, it, can, help, reduce, carbon, dioxide, emissions, by, diverting, energy, use, from, fossil, fuels, while, also, generating, energy, and, using, waste, as, fuel, can, reduce, the, methane, emissions, generated, in, landfills, by, averting, waste, from, landfills, there, is, some, debate, in, the, classification, of, certain, biomass, feedstock, as, wastes, crude, tall, oil, cto, a, co, product, of, the, pulp, and, papermaking, process, is, defined, as, a, waste, or, residue, in, some, european, countries, when, in, fact, it, is, produced, on, purpose, and, has, significant, value, add, potential, in, industrial, applications, several, companies, use, cto, to, produce, fuel, while, the, pine, chemicals, industry, maximizes, it, as, a, feedstock, producing, low, carbon, bio, based, chemicals, through, cascading, use, education, and, awareness, in, the, area, of, waste, and, waste, management, is, increasingly, important, from, a, global, perspective, of, resource, management, the, talloires, declaration, is, a, declaration, for, sustainability, concerned, about, the, unprecedented, scale, and, speed, of, environmental, pollution, and, degradation, and, the, depletion, of, natural, resources, local, regional, and, global, air, pollution, accumulation, and, distribution, of, toxic, wastes, destruction, and, depletion, of, forests, soil, and, water, depletion, of, the, ozone, layer, and, emission, of, green, house, gases, threaten, the, survival, of, humans, and, thousands, of, other, living, species, the, integrity, of, the, earth, and, its, biodiversity, the, security, of, nations, and, the, heritage, of, future, generations, several, universities, have, implemented, the, talloires, declaration, by, establishing, environmental, management, and, waste, management, programs, e, g, the, waste, management, university, project, university, and, vocational, education, are, promoted, by, various, organizations, e, g, wamitab, and, chartered, institution, of, wastes, management
