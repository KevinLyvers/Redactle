inland, waterways, most, are, pushed, by, pusher, boats, or, other, vessels, the, term, barge, has, a, rich, history, and, therefore, there, are, many, other, types, of, barges, barge, is, attested, from, 1300, from, old, french, barge, from, vulgar, latin, barga, the, word, originally, could, refer, to, any, small, boat, the, modern, meaning, arose, around, 1480, bark, small, ship, is, attested,

and, similar, ba, y, r, for, basket, shaped, boat, by, extension, the, term, embark, literally, means, to, board, the, kind, of, boat, called, a, barque, in, great, britain, a, merchant, barge, was, originally, a, flat, bottomed, merchant, vessel, for, use, on, navigable, rivers, most, of, these, barges, had, sails, for, traffic, on, the, river, severn, the, barge, was, described, as, the, lesser, sort, are, called, barges, and, frigates, being, from, forty, to, sixty, feet, in, length, having, a, single, mast, and, square, sail, and, carrying, from, twenty, to, forty, tons, burthen, the, larger, vessels, were, called, trows, on, the, river, irwell, there, was, reference, to, barges, passing, below, barton, aqueduct, with, their, mast, and, sails, standing, barges, on, the, thames, were, called, west, country, barges, during, the, industrial, revolution, a, substantial, network, of, narrow, canals, was, developed, in, great, britain, from, 1750, onward, these, new, british, canals, had, locks, of, only, 7, feet, 2, 1, m, wide, this, led, to, the, development, of, the, narrowboats, which, had, a, beam, of, no, more, than, 6, feet, 10, inches, 2, 08, m, it, was, soon, realized, that, the, narrow, locks, were, too, limiting, later, locks, were, therefore, doubled, in, width, to, 14, feet, 4, 3, m, this, led, to, the, development, of, the, widebeam, the, narrowboats, were, initially, also, known, as, barges, but, only, a, very, few, had, sails, unlike, earlier, vessels, from, the, start, most, of, the, new, canals, were, constructed, with, an, adjacent, towpath, along, which, draft, horses, walked, towing, the, barges, these, types, of, canal, craft, are, so, specific, that, on, the, british, canal, system, the, term, barge, was, not, used, to, describe, narrowboats, and, widebeams, narrowboats, and, widebeams, are, still, used, on, canals, now, engine, powered, on, the, british, canal, system, the, thames, sailing, barge, and, dutch, barge, and, unspecified, other, styles, of, barge, are, still, known, as, barges, the, term, dutch, barge, is, nowadays, often, used, to, refer, to, an, accommodation, ship, but, originally, refers, to, the, slightly, larger, dutch, version, of, the, thames, sailing, barge, the, people, who, moved, barges, were, known, as, lightermen, poles, are, used, on, barges, to, fend, off, other, nearby, vessels, or, a, wharf, these, are, often, called, pike, poles, the, long, pole, used, to, maneuver, or, propel, a, barge, has, given, rise, to, the, saying, i, wouldn, t, touch, that, with, a, barge, pole, in, the, united, kingdom, the, word, barge, had, many, meanings, by, the, 1890s, and, these, varied, locally, on, the, mersey, a, barge, was, called, a, flat, on, the, thames, a, lighter, or, barge, and, on, the, humber, a, keel, a, lighter, had, neither, mast, nor, rigging, a, keel, did, have, a, single, mast, with, sails, barge, and, lighter, were, used, indiscriminately, a, local, distinction, was, that, any, flat, that, was, not, propelled, by, steam, was, a, barge, although, it, might, be, a, sailing, flat, the, term, dumb, barge, was, probably, taken, into, use, to, end, the, confusion, the, term, dumb, barge, surfaced, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, it, first, denoted, the, use, of, a, barge, as, a, mooring, platform, in, a, fixed, place, as, it, went, up, and, down, with, the, tides, it, made, a, very, convenient, mooring, place, for, steam, vessels, within, a, few, decades, the, term, dumb, barge, evolved, and, came, to, mean, a, vessel, propelled, by, oars, only, by, the, 1890s, dumb, barge, was, still, used, only, on, the, thames, by, 1880, barges, on, british, rivers, and, canals, were, often, towed, by, steam, tugboats, on, the, thames, many, dumb, barges, still, relied, on, their, poles, oars, and, the, tide, others, dumb, barges, made, use, of, about, 50, tugboats, to, tow, them, to, their, destinations, while, many, coal, barges, were, towed, many, dumb, barges, that, handled, single, parcels, were, not, in, the, united, states, a, barge, was, not, a, sailing, vessel, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, indeed, barges, were, often, created, by, cutting, down, razeeing, sailing, vessels, in, new, york, this, was, an, accepted, meaning, of, the, term, barge, the, somewhat, smaller, scow, was, built, as, such, but, the, scow, also, had, its, sailing, counterpart, the, sailing, scow, the, innovation, that, led, to, the, modern, barge, was, the, use, of, iron, barges, towed, by, a, steam, tugboat, these, were, first, used, to, transport, grain, and, other, bulk, products, from, about, 1840, to, 1870, the, towed, iron, barge, was, quickly, introduced, on, the, rhine, danube, don, dniester, and, rivers, in, egypt, india, and, australia, many, of, these, barges, were, built, in, great, britain, nowadays, barge, generally, refers, to, a, dumb, barge, in, europe, a, dumb, barge, is, an, inland, waterway, transport, freight, vessel, designed, to, be, towed, which, does, not, have, its, own, means, of, mechanical, propulsion, in, america, a, barge, is, generally, pushed, barges, are, used, today, for, transporting, low, value, bulk, items, as, the, cost, of, hauling, goods, that, way, is, very, low, and, for, larger, project, cargo, such, as, offshore, wind, turbine, blades, barges, are, also, used, for, very, heavy, or, bulky, items, a, typical, american, barge, measures, 195, by, 35, feet, 59, 4, m, 10, 7, m, and, can, carry, up, to, about, 1, 500, short, tons, 1, 400, t, of, cargo, the, most, common, european, barges, measure, 251, by, 37, feet, 76, 5, m, 11, 4, m, and, can, carry, up, to, about, 2, 450, tonnes, 2, 700, short, tons, as, an, example, on, june, 26, 2006, in, the, us, a, 565, short, ton, 513, t, catalytic, cracking, unit, reactor, was, shipped, by, barge, from, the, tulsa, port, of, catoosa, in, oklahoma, to, a, refinery, in, pascagoula, mississippi, extremely, large, objects, are, normally, shipped, in, sections, and, assembled, after, delivery, but, shipping, an, assembled, unit, reduces, costs, and, avoids, reliance, on, construction, labor, at, the, delivery, site, which, in, the, case, of, the, reactor, was, still, recovering, from, hurricane, katrina, of, the, reactor, s, 700, mile, 1, 100, km, journey, only, about, 40, miles, 64, km, were, traveled, overland, from, the, final, port, to, the, refinery, the, transportation, institute, at, texas, a, m, found, that, inland, barge, transportation, in, the, us, produces, far, fewer, emissions, of, carbon, dioxide, for, each, ton, of, cargo, moved, compared, to, transport, by, truck, or, rail, according, to, the, study, transporting, cargo, by, barge, produces, 43, less, greenhouse, gas, emissions, than, rail, and, more, than, 800, less, than, trucks, environmentalists, claim, that, in, areas, where, barges, tugboats, and, towboats, idle, may, produce, more, emissions, like, in, the, locks, and, dams, of, the, mississippi, river, self, propelled, barges, may, be, used, for, traveling, downstream, or, upstream, in, placid, waters, they, are, operated, as, an, unpowered, barge, with, the, assistance, of, a, tugboat, when, traveling, upstream, in, faster, waters, canal, barges, are, usually, made, for, the, particular, canal, in, which, they, will, operate, unpowered, vessels, barges, may, be, used, for, other, purposes, such, as, large, accommodation, vessels, towed, to, where, they, are, needed, and, stationed, there, as, long, as, necessary,
