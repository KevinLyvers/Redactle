fiber, or, fibre, british, english, from, latin, fibra, is, a, natural, or, artificial, substance, that, is, significantly, longer, than, it, is, wide, fibers, are, often, used, in, the, manufacture, of, other, materials, the, strongest, engineering, materials, often, incorporate, fibers, for, example, carbon, fiber, and, ultra, high, molecular, weight, polyethylene, synthetic, fibers, can, often, be, produced, very, cheaply, and, in, large, amounts, compared, to, natural, fibers, but, for, clothing, natural, fibers, have, some, benefits, such, as, comfort, over, their, synthetic, counterparts, natural, fibers, develop, or, occur, in, the, fiber, shape, and, include, those, produced, by, plants, animals, and, geological, processes, they, can, be, classified, according, to, their, origin, artificial, or, chemical, fibers, are, fibers, whose, chemical, composition, structure, and, properties, are, significantly, modified, during, the, manufacturing, process, in, fashion, a, fiber, is, a, long, and, thin, strand, or, thread, of, material, that, can, be, knit, or, woven, into, a, fabric, artificial, fibers, consist, of, regenerated, fibers, and, synthetic, fibers, semi, synthetic, fibers, are, made, from, raw, materials, with, naturally, long, chain, polymer, structure, and, are, only, modified, and, partially, degraded, by, chemical, processes, in, contrast, to, completely, synthetic, fibers, such, as, nylon, polyamide, or, dacron, polyester, which, the, chemist, synthesizes, from, low, molecular, weight, compounds, by, polymerization, chain, building, reactions, the, earliest, semi, synthetic, fiber, is, the, cellulose, regenerated, fiber, rayon, most, semi, synthetic, fibers, are, cellulose, regenerated, fibers, cellulose, fibers, are, a, subset, of, artificial, fibers, regenerated, from, natural, cellulose, the, cellulose, comes, from, various, sources, rayon, from, tree, wood, fiber, bamboo, fiber, from, bamboo, seacell, from, seaweed, etc, in, the, production, of, these, fibers, the, cellulose, is, reduced, to, a, fairly, pure, form, as, a, viscous, mass, and, formed, into, fibers, by, extrusion, through, spinnerets, therefore, the, manufacturing, process, leaves, few, characteristics, distinctive, of, the, natural, source, material, in, the, finished, products, some, examples, of, this, fiber, type, are, historically, cellulose, diacetate, and, triacetate, were, classified, under, the, term, rayon, but, are, now, considered, distinct, materials, synthetic, come, entirely, from, synthetic, materials, such, as, petrochemicals, unlike, those, artificial, fibers, derived, from, such, natural, substances, as, cellulose, or, protein, fiber, classification, in, reinforced, plastics, falls, into, two, classes, i, short, fibers, also, known, as, discontinuous, fibers, with, a, general, aspect, ratio, defined, as, the, ratio, of, fiber, length, to, diameter, between, 20, and, 60, and, ii, long, fibers, also, known, as, continuous, fibers, the, general, aspect, ratio, is, between, 200, and, 500, metallic, fibers, can, be, drawn, from, ductile, metals, such, as, copper, gold, or, silver, and, extruded, or, deposited, from, more, brittle, ones, such, as, nickel, aluminum, or, iron, carbon, fibers, are, often, based, on, oxidized, and, via, pyrolysis, carbonized, polymers, like, pan, but, the, end, product, is, almost, pure, carbon, silicon, carbide, fibers, where, the, basic, polymers, are, not, hydrocarbons, but, polymers, where, about, 50, of, the, carbon, atoms, are, replaced, by, silicon, atoms, so, called, poly, carbo, silanes, the, pyrolysis, yields, an, amorphous, silicon, carbide, including, mostly, other, elements, like, oxygen, titanium, or, aluminium, but, with, mechanical, properties, very, similar, to, those, of, carbon, fibers, fiberglass, made, from, specific, glass, and, optical, fiber, made, from, purified, natural, quartz, are, also, artificial, fibers, that, come, from, natural, raw, materials, silica, fiber, made, from, sodium, silicate, water, glass, and, basalt, fiber, made, from, melted, basalt, mineral, fibers, can, be, particularly, strong, because, they, are, formed, with, a, low, number, of, surface, defects, asbestos, is, a, common, one, invented, in, japan, in, the, early, 1980s, microfibers, are, also, known, as, microdenier, fibers, acrylic, nylon, polyester, lyocell, and, rayon, can, be, produced, as, microfibers, in, 1986, hoechst, a, g, of, germany, produced, microfiber, in, europe, this, fiber, made, it, way, into, the, united, states, in, 1990, by, dupont, microfibers, in, textiles, refer, to, sub, denier, fiber, such, as, polyester, drawn, to, 0, 5, denier, denier, and, dtex, are, two, measurements, of, fiber, yield, based, on, weight, and, length, if, the, fiber, density, is, known, you, also, have, a, fiber, diameter, otherwise, it, is, simpler, to, measure, diameters, in, micrometers, microfibers, in, technical, fibers, refer, to, ultra, fine, fibers, glass, or, meltblown, thermoplastics, often, used, in, filtration, newer, fiber, designs, include, extruding, fiber, that, splits, into, multiple, finer, fibers, most, synthetic, fibers, are, round, in, cross, section, but, special, designs, can, be, hollow, oval, star, shaped, or, trilobal, the, latter, design, provides, more, optically, reflective, properties, synthetic, textile, fibers, are, often, crimped, to, provide, bulk, in, a, woven, non, woven, or, knitted, structure, fiber, surfaces, can, also, be, dull, or, bright, dull, surfaces, reflect, more, light, while, bright, tends, to, transmit, light, and, make, the, fiber, more, transparent, very, short, and, or, irregular, fibers, have, been, called, fibrils, natural, cellulose, such, as, cotton, or, bleached, kraft, show, smaller, fibrils, jutting, out, and, away, from, the, main, fiber, structure, fibers, can, be, divided, into, natural, and, artificial, synthetic, substance, their, properties, can, affect, their, performance, in, many, applications, synthetic, fiber, materials, are, increasingly, replacing, other, conventional, materials, like, glass, and, wood, in, a, number, of, applications, this, is, because, artificial, fibers, can, be, engineered, chemically, physically, and, mechanically, to, suit, particular, technical, engineering, in, choosing, a, fiber, type, a, manufacturer, would, balance, their, properties, with, the, technical, requirements, of, the, applications, various, fibers, are, available, to, select, for, manufacturing, here, are, typical,
