a, relay, is, an, electrically, operated, switch, it, consists, of, a, set, of, input, terminals, for, a, single, or, multiple, control, signals, and, a, set, of, operating, contact, terminals, the, switch, may, have, any, number, of, contacts, in, multiple, contact, forms, such, as, make, contacts, break, contacts, or, combinations, thereof, relays, are, used, where, it, is, necessary, to, control, a, circuit, by, an, independent, low, power, signal, or, where, several, circuits, must, be, controlled, by, one, signal, relays, were, first, used, in, long, distance, telegraph, circuits, as, signal, repeaters, they, refresh, the, signal, coming, in, from, one, circuit, by, transmitting, it, on, another, circuit, relays, were, used, extensively, in, telephone, exchanges, and, early, computers, to, perform, logical, operations, the, traditional, electromechanical, form, of, a, relay, uses, an, electromagnet, to, close, or, open, the, contacts, but, relays, using, other, operating, principles, have, also, been, invented, such, as, in, solid, state, relays, which, use, semiconductor, properties, for, control, without, relying, on, moving, parts, relays, with, calibrated, operating, characteristics, and, sometimes, multiple, operating, coils, are, used, to, protect, electrical, circuits, from, overload, or, faults, in, modern, electric, power, systems, these, functions, are, performed, by, digital, instruments, still, called, protective, relays, or, safety, relays, latching, relays, require, only, a, single, pulse, of, control, power, to, operate, the, switch, persistently, another, pulse, applied, to, a, second, set, of, control, terminals, or, a, pulse, with, opposite, polarity, resets, the, switch, while, repeated, pulses, of, the, same, kind, have, no, effects, magnetic, latching, relays, are, useful, in, applications, when, interrupted, power, should, not, affect, the, circuits, that, the, relay, is, controlling, electrical, relays, got, their, start, in, application, to, telegraphs, american, scientist, joseph, henry, is, often, cited, to, have, invented, a, relay, in, 1835, in, order, to, improve, his, version, of, the, electrical, telegraph, developed, earlier, in, 1831, however, an, official, patent, was, not, issued, until, 1840, to, samuel, morse, for, his, telegraph, which, is, now, called, a, relay, the, mechanism, described, acted, as, a, digital, amplifier, repeating, the, telegraph, signal, and, thus, allowing, signals, to, be, propagated, as, far, as, desired, the, word, relay, appears, in, the, context, of, electromagnetic, operations, from, 1860, onwards, a, simple, electromagnetic, relay, consists, of, a, coil, of, wire, wrapped, around, a, soft, iron, core, a, solenoid, an, iron, yoke, which, provides, a, low, reluctance, path, for, magnetic, flux, a, movable, iron, armature, and, one, or, more, sets, of, contacts, there, are, two, contacts, in, the, relay, pictured, the, armature, is, hinged, to, the, yoke, and, mechanically, linked, to, one, or, more, sets, of, moving, contacts, the, armature, is, held, in, place, by, a, spring, so, that, when, the, relay, is, de, energized, there, is, an, air, gap, in, the, magnetic, circuit, in, this, condition, one, of, the, two, sets, of, contacts, in, the, relay, pictured, is, closed, and, the, other, set, is, open, other, relays, may, have, more, or, fewer, sets, of, contacts, depending, on, their, function, the, relay, in, the, picture, also, has, a, wire, connecting, the, armature, to, the, yoke, this, ensures, continuity, of, the, circuit, between, the, moving, contacts, on, the, armature, and, the, circuit, track, on, the, printed, circuit, board, pcb, via, the, yoke, which, is, soldered, to, the, pcb, when, an, electric, current, is, passed, through, the, coil, it, generates, a, magnetic, field, that, activates, the, armature, and, the, consequent, movement, of, the, movable, contact, s, either, makes, or, breaks, depending, upon, construction, a, connection, with, a, fixed, contact, if, the, set, of, contacts, was, closed, when, the, relay, was, de, energized, then, the, movement, opens, the, contacts, and, breaks, the, connection, and, vice, versa, if, the, contacts, were, open, when, the, current, to, the, coil, is, switched, off, the, armature, is, returned, by, a, force, approximately, half, as, strong, as, the, magnetic, force, to, its, relaxed, position, usually, this, force, is, provided, by, a, spring, but, gravity, is, also, used, commonly, in, industrial, motor, starters, most, relays, are, manufactured, to, operate, quickly, in, a, low, voltage, application, this, reduces, noise, in, a, high, voltage, or, current, application, it, reduces, arcing, when, the, coil, is, energized, with, direct, current, a, flyback, diode, or, snubber, resistor, is, often, placed, across, the, coil, to, dissipate, the, energy, from, the, collapsing, magnetic, field, back, emf, at, deactivation, which, would, otherwise, generate, a, voltage, spike, dangerous, to, semiconductor, circuit, components, such, diodes, were, not, widely, used, before, the, application, of, transistors, as, relay, drivers, but, soon, became, ubiquitous, as, early, germanium, transistors, were, easily, destroyed, by, this, surge, some, automotive, relays, include, a, diode, inside, the, relay, case, resistors, while, more, durable, than, diodes, are, less, efficient, at, eliminating, voltage, spikes, generated, by, relays, and, therefore, not, as, commonly, used, if, the, relay, is, driving, a, large, or, especially, a, reactive, load, there, may, be, a, similar, problem, of, surge, currents, around, the, relay, output, contacts, in, this, case, a, snubber, circuit, a, capacitor, and, resistor, in, series, across, the, contacts, may, absorb, the, surge, suitably, rated, capacitors, and, the, associated, resistor, are, sold, as, a, single, packaged, component, for, this, commonplace, use, if, the, coil, is, designed, to, be, energized, with, alternating, current, ac, some, method, is, used, to, split, the, flux, into, two, out, of, phase, components, which, add, together, increasing, the, minimum, pull, on, the, armature, during, the, ac, cycle, typically, this, is, done, with, a, small, copper, shading, ring, crimped, around, a, portion, of, the, core, that, creates, the, delayed, out, of, phase, component, which, holds, the, contacts, during, the, zero, crossings, of, the, control, voltage, contact, materials, for, relays, vary, by, application, materials, with, low, contact, resistance, may, be, oxidized, by, the, air, or, may, tend, to, stick, instead, of, cleanly, parting, when, opening, contact, material, may, be, optimized, for, low, electrical, resistance, high, strength, to, withstand, repeated, operations, or, high, capacity, to, withstand, the, heat, of, an, arc, where, very, low, resistance, is, required, or, low, thermally, induced, voltages, are, desired, gold, plated, contacts, may, be, used, along, with, palladium, and, other, non, oxidizing, semi, precious, metals, silver, or, silver, plated, contacts, are, used, for, signal, switching, mercury, wetted, relays, make, and, break, circuits, using, a, thin, self, renewing, film, of, liquid, mercury, for, higher, power, relays, switching, many, amperes, such, as, motor, circuit, contactors, contacts, are, made, with, a, mixtures, of, silver, and, cadmium, oxide, providing, low, contact, resistance, and, high, resistance, to, the, heat, of, arcing, contacts, used, in, circuits, carrying, scores, or, hundreds, of, amperes, may, include, additional, structures, for, heat, dissipation, and, management, of, the, arc, produced, when, interrupting, the, circuit, some, relays, have, field, replaceable, contacts, such, as, certain, machine, tool, relays, these, may, be, replaced, when, worn, out, or, changed, between, normally, open, and, normally, closed, state, to, allow, for, changes, in, the, controlled, circuit, since, relays, are, switches, the, terminology, applied, to, switches, is, also, applied, to, relays, a, relay, switches, one, or, more, poles, each, of, whose, contacts, can, be, thrown, by, energizing, the, coil, normally, open, no, contacts, connect, the, circuit, when, the, relay, is, activated, the, circuit, is, disconnected, when, the, relay, is, inactive, normally, closed, nc, contacts, disconnect, the, circuit, when, the, relay, is, activated, the, circuit, is, connected, when, the, relay, is, inactive, all, of, the, contact, forms, involve, combinations, of, no, and, nc, connections, the, national, association, of, relay, manufacturers, and, its, successor, the, relay, and, switch, industry, association, define, 23, distinct, electrical, contact, forms, found, in, relays, and, switches, of, these, the, following, are, commonly, encountered, the, s, single, or, d, double, designator, for, the, pole, count, may, be, replaced, with, a, number, indicating, multiple, contacts, connected, to, a, single, actuator, for, example, 4pdt, indicates, a, four, pole, double, throw, relay, that, has, 12, switching, terminals, en, 50005, are, among, applicable, standards, for, relay, terminal, numbering, a, typical, en, 50005, compliant, spdt, relay, s, terminals, would, be, numbered, 11, 12, 14, a1, and, a2, for, the, c, nc, no, and, coil, connections, respectively, din, 72552, defines, contact, numbers, in, relays, for, automotive, use, where, radio, transmitters, and, receivers, share, one, antenna, often, a, coaxial, relay, is, used, as, a, tr, transmit, receive, relay, which, switches, the, antenna, from, the, receiver, to, the, transmitter, this, protects, the, receiver, from, the, high, power, of, the, transmitter, such, relays, are, often, used, in, transceivers, which, combine, transmitter, and, receiver, in, one, unit, the, relay, contacts, are, designed, not, to, reflect, any, radio, frequency, power, back, toward, the, source, and, to, provide, very, high, isolation, between, receiver, and, transmitter, terminals, the, characteristic, impedance, of, the, relay, is, matched, to, the, transmission, line, impedance, of, the, system, for, example, 50, ohms, a, contactor, is, a, heavy, duty, relay, with, higher, current, ratings, used, for, switching, electric, motors, and, lighting, loads, continuous, current, ratings, for, common, contactors, range, from, 10, amps, to, several, hundred, amps, high, current, contacts, are, made, with, alloys, containing, silver, the, unavoidable, arcing, causes, the, contacts, to, oxidize, however, silver, oxide, is, still, a, good, conductor, contactors, with, overload, protection, devices, are, often, used, to, start, motors, a, force, guided, contacts, relay, has, relay, contacts, that, are, mechanically, linked, together, so, that, when, the, relay, coil, is, energized, or, de, energized, all, of, the, linked, contacts, move, together, if, one, set, of, contacts, in, the, relay, becomes, immobilized, no, other, contact, of, the, same, relay, will, be, able, to, move, the, function, of, force, guided, contacts, is, to, enable, the, safety, circuit, to, check, the, status, of, the, relay, force, guided, contacts, are, also, known, as, positive, guided, contacts, captive, contacts, locked, contacts, mechanically, linked, contacts, or, safety, relays, these, safety, relays, have, to, follow, design, rules, and, manufacturing, rules, that, are, defined, in, one, main, machinery, standard, en, 50205, relays, with, forcibly, guided, mechanically, linked, contacts, these, rules, for, the, safety, design, are, the, one, defined, in, type, b, standards, such, as, en, 13849, 2, as, basic, safety, principles, and, well, tried, safety, principles, for, machinery, that, applies, to, all, machines, force, guided, contacts, by, themselves, can, not, guarantee, that, all, contacts, are, in, the, same, state, however, they, do, guarantee, subject, to, no, gross, mechanical, fault, that, no, contacts, are, in, opposite, states, otherwise, a, relay, with, several, normally, open, no, contacts, may, stick, when, energized, with, some, contacts, closed, and, others, still, slightly, open, due, to, mechanical, tolerances, similarly, a, relay, with, several, normally, closed, nc, contacts, may, stick, to, the, unenergized, position, so, that, when, energized, the, circuit, through, one, set, of, contacts, is, broken, with, a, marginal, gap, while, the, other, remains, closed, by, introducing, both, no, and, nc, contacts, or, more, commonly, changeover, contacts, on, the, same, relay, it, then, becomes, possible, to, guarantee, that, if, any, nc, contact, is, closed, all, no, contacts, are, open, and, conversely, if, any, no, contact, is, closed, all, nc, contacts, are, open, it, is, not, possible, to, reliably, ensure, that, any, particular, contact, is, closed, except, by, potentially, intrusive, and, safety, degrading, sensing, of, its, circuit, conditions, however, in, safety, systems, it, is, usually, the, no, state, that, is, most, important, and, as, explained, above, this, is, reliably, verifiable, by, detecting, the, closure, of, a, contact, of, opposite, sense, force, guided, contact, relays, are, made, with, different, main, contact, sets, either, no, nc, or, changeover, and, one, or, more, auxiliary, contact, sets, often, of, reduced, current, or, voltage, rating, used, for, the, monitoring, system, contacts, may, be, all, no, all, nc, changeover, or, a, mixture, of, these, for, the, monitoring, contacts, so, that, the, safety, system, designer, can, select, the, correct, configuration, for, the, particular, application, safety, relays, are, used, as, part, of, an, engineered, safety, system, a, latching, relay, also, called, impulse, bistable, keep, or, stay, relay, or, simply, latch, maintains, either, contact, position, indefinitely, without, power, applied, to, the, coil, the, advantage, is, that, one, coil, consumes, power, only, for, an, instant, while, the, relay, is, being, switched, and, the, relay, contacts, retain, this, setting, across, a, power, outage, a, latching, relay, allows, remote, control, of, building, lighting, without, the, hum, that, may, be, produced, from, a, continuously, ac, energized, coil, in, one, mechanism, two, opposing, coils, with, an, over, center, spring, or, permanent, magnet, hold, the, contacts, in, position, after, the, coil, is, de, energized, a, pulse, to, one, coil, turns, the, relay, on, and, a, pulse, to, the, opposite, coil, turns, the, relay, off, this, type, is, widely, used, where, control, is, from, simple, switches, or, single, ended, outputs, of, a, control, system, and, such, relays, are, found, in, avionics, and, numerous, industrial, applications, another, latching, type, has, a, remanent, core, that, retains, the, contacts, in, the, operated, position, by, the, remanent, magnetism, in, the, core, this, type, requires, a, current, pulse, of, opposite, polarity, to, release, the, contacts, a, variation, uses, a, permanent, magnet, that, produces, part, of, the, force, required, to, close, the, contact, the, coil, supplies, sufficient, force, to, move, the, contact, open, or, closed, by, aiding, or, opposing, the, field, of, the, permanent, magnet, a, polarity, controlled, relay, needs, changeover, switches, or, an, h, bridge, drive, circuit, to, control, it, the, relay, may, be, less, expensive, than, other, types, but, this, is, partly, offset, by, the, increased, costs, in, the, external, circuit, in, another, type, a, ratchet, relay, has, a, ratchet, mechanism, that, holds, the, contacts, closed, after, the, coil, is, momentarily, energized, a, second, impulse, in, the, same, or, a, separate, coil, releases, the, contacts, this, type, may, be, found, in, certain, cars, for, headlamp, dipping, and, other, functions, where, alternating, operation, on, each, switch, actuation, is, needed, a, stepping, relay, is, a, specialized, kind, of, multi, way, latching, relay, designed, for, early, automatic, telephone, exchanges, an, earth, leakage, circuit, breaker, includes, a, specialized, latching, relay, very, early, computers, often, stored, bits, in, a, magnetically, latching, relay, such, as, ferreed, or, the, later, remreed, in, the, 1ess, switch, some, early, computers, used, ordinary, relays, as, a, kind, of, latch, they, store, bits, in, ordinary, wire, spring, relays, or, reed, relays, by, feeding, an, output, wire, back, as, an, input, resulting, in, a, feedback, loop, or, sequential, circuit, such, an, electrically, latching, relay, requires, continuous, power, to, maintain, state, unlike, magnetically, latching, relays, or, mechanically, ratcheting, relays, while, self, holding, circuits, are, often, realized, with, relays, they, can, also, be, implemented, by, other, means, in, computer, memories, latching, relays, and, other, relays, were, replaced, by, delay, line, memory, which, in, turn, was, replaced, by, a, series, of, ever, faster, and, ever, smaller, memory, technologies, a, machine, tool, relay, is, a, type, standardized, for, industrial, control, of, machine, tools, transfer, machines, and, other, sequential, control, they, are, characterized, by, a, large, number, of, contacts, sometimes, extendable, in, the, field, which, are, easily, converted, from, normally, open, to, normally, closed, status, easily, replaceable, coils, and, a, form, factor, that, allows, compactly, installing, many, relays, in, a, control, panel, although, such, relays, once, were, the, backbone, of, automation, in, such, industries, as, automobile, assembly, the, programmable, logic, controller, plc, mostly, displaced, the, machine, tool, relay, from, sequential, control, applications, a, relay, allows, circuits, to, be, switched, by, electrical, equipment, for, example, a, timer, circuit, with, a, relay, could, switch, power, at, a, preset, time, for, many, years, relays, were, the, standard, method, of, controlling, industrial, electronic, systems, a, number, of, relays, could, be, used, together, to, carry, out, complex, functions, relay, logic, the, principle, of, relay, logic, is, based, on, relays, which, energize, and, de, energize, associated, contacts, relay, logic, is, the, predecessor, of, ladder, logic, which, is, commonly, used, in, programmable, logic, controllers, a, mercury, relay, is, a, relay, that, uses, mercury, as, the, switching, element, they, are, used, where, contact, erosion, would, be, a, problem, for, conventional, relay, contacts, owing, to, environmental, considerations, about, significant, amount, of, mercury, used, and, modern, alternatives, they, are, now, comparatively, uncommon, a, mercury, wetted, reed, relay, is, a, form, of, reed, relay, that, employs, a, mercury, switch, in, which, the, contacts, are, wetted, with, mercury, mercury, reduces, the, contact, resistance, and, mitigates, the, associated, voltage, drop, surface, contamination, may, result, in, poor, conductivity, for, low, current, signals, for, high, speed, applications, the, mercury, eliminates, contact, bounce, and, provides, virtually, instantaneous, circuit, closure, mercury, wetted, relays, are, position, sensitive, and, must, be, mounted, according, to, the, manufacturer, s, specifications, because, of, the, toxicity, and, expense, of, liquid, mercury, these, relays, have, increasingly, fallen, into, disuse, the, high, speed, of, switching, action, of, the, mercury, wetted, relay, is, a, notable, advantage, the, mercury, globules, on, each, contact, coalesce, and, the, current, rise, time, through, the, contacts, is, generally, considered, to, be, a, few, picoseconds, however, in, a, practical, circuit, it, may, be, limited, by, the, inductance, of, the, contacts, and, wiring, it, was, quite, common, before, restrictions, on, the, use, of, mercury, to, use, a, mercury, wetted, relay, in, the, laboratory, as, a, convenient, means, of, generating, fast, rise, time, pulses, however, although, the, rise, time, may, be, picoseconds, the, exact, timing, of, the, event, is, like, all, other, types, of, relay, subject, to, considerable, jitter, possibly, milliseconds, due, to, mechanical, variations, the, same, coalescence, process, causes, another, effect, which, is, a, nuisance, in, some, applications, the, contact, resistance, is, not, stable, immediately, after, contact, closure, and, drifts, mostly, downwards, for, several, seconds, after, closure, the, change, perhaps, being, 0, 5, ohm, multi, voltage, relays, are, devices, designed, to, work, for, wide, voltage, ranges, such, as, 24, to, 240, vac, and, vdc, and, wide, frequency, ranges, such, as, 0, to, 300, hz, they, are, indicated, for, use, in, installations, that, do, not, have, stable, supply, voltages, electric, motors, need, overcurrent, protection, to, prevent, damage, from, over, loading, the, motor, or, to, protect, against, short, circuits, in, connecting, cables, or, internal, faults, in, the, motor, windings, the, overload, sensing, devices, are, a, form, of, heat, operated, relay, where, a, coil, heats, a, bimetallic, strip, or, where, a, solder, pot, melts, to, operate, auxiliary, contacts, these, auxiliary, contacts, are, in, series, with, the, motor, s, contactor, coil, so, they, turn, off, the, motor, when, it, overheats, this, thermal, protection, operates, relatively, slowly, allowing, the, motor, to, draw, higher, starting, currents, before, the, protection, relay, will, trip, where, the, overload, relay, is, exposed, to, the, same, ambient, temperature, as, the, motor, a, useful, though, crude, compensation, for, motor, ambient, temperature, is, provided, the, other, common, overload, protection, system, uses, an, electromagnet, coil, in, series, with, the, motor, circuit, that, directly, operates, contacts, this, is, similar, to, a, control, relay, but, requires, a, rather, high, fault, current, to, operate, the, contacts, to, prevent, short, over, current, spikes, from, causing, nuisance, triggering, the, armature, movement, is, damped, with, a, dashpot, the, thermal, and, magnetic, overload, detections, are, typically, used, together, in, a, motor, protection, relay, electronic, overload, protection, relays, measure, motor, current, and, can, estimate, motor, winding, temperature, using, a, thermal, model, of, the, motor, armature, system, that, can, be, set, to, provide, more, accurate, motor, protection, some, motor, protection, relays, include, temperature, detector, inputs, for, direct, measurement, from, a, thermocouple, or, resistance, thermometer, sensor, embedded, in, the, winding, a, polarized, relay, places, the, armature, between, the, poles, of, a, permanent, magnet, to, increase, sensitivity, polarized, relays, were, used, in, middle, 20th, century, telephone, exchanges, to, detect, faint, pulses, and, correct, telegraphic, distortion, a, reed, relay, is, a, reed, switch, enclosed, in, a, solenoid, the, switch, has, a, set, of, contacts, inside, an, evacuated, or, inert, gas, filled, glass, tube, that, protects, the, contacts, against, atmospheric, corrosion, the, contacts, are, made, of, magnetic, material, that, makes, them, move, under, the, influence, of, the, field, of, the, enclosing, solenoid, or, an, external, magnet, reed, relays, can, switch, faster, than, larger, relays, and, require, very, little, power, from, the, control, circuit, however, they, have, relatively, low, switching, current, and, voltage, ratings, though, rare, the, reeds, can, become, magnetized, over, time, which, makes, them, stick, on, even, when, no, current, is, present, changing, the, orientation, of, the, reeds, or, degaussing, the, switch, with, respect, to, the, solenoid, s, magnetic, field, can, resolve, this, problem, sealed, contacts, with, mercury, wetted, contacts, have, longer, operating, lives, and, less, contact, chatter, than, any, other, kind, of, relay, safety, relays, are, devices, which, generally, implement, protection, functions, in, the, event, of, a, hazard, the, task, of, such, a, safety, function, is, to, use, appropriate, measures, to, reduce, the, existing, risk, to, an, acceptable, level, a, solid, state, contactor, is, a, heavy, duty, solid, state, relay, including, the, necessary, heat, sink, used, where, frequent, on, off, cycles, are, required, such, as, with, electric, heaters, small, electric, motors, and, lighting, loads, there, are, no, moving, parts, to, wear, out, and, there, is, no, contact, bounce, due, to, vibration, they, are, activated, by, ac, control, signals, or, dc, control, signals, from, programmable, logic, controllers, plcs, pcs, transistor, transistor, logic, ttl, sources, or, other, microprocessor, and, microcontroller, controls, a, solid, state, relay, ssr, is, a, solid, state, electronic, component, that, provides, a, function, similar, to, an, electromechanical, relay, but, does, not, have, any, moving, components, increasing, long, term, reliability, a, solid, state, relay, uses, a, thyristor, triac, or, other, solid, state, switching, device, activated, by, the, control, signal, to, switch, the, controlled, load, instead, of, a, solenoid, an, optocoupler, a, light, emitting, diode, led, coupled, with, a, photo, transistor, can, be, used, to, isolate, control, and, controlled, circuits, a, static, relay, consists, of, electronic, circuitry, to, emulate, all, those, characteristics, which, are, achieved, by, moving, parts, in, an, electro, magnetic, relay, timing, relays, are, arranged, for, an, intentional, delay, in, operating, their, contacts, a, very, short, a, fraction, of, a, second, delay, would, use, a, copper, disk, between, the, armature, and, moving, blade, assembly, current, flowing, in, the, disk, maintains, a, magnetic, field, for, a, short, time, lengthening, release, time, for, a, slightly, longer, up, to, a, minute, delay, a, dashpot, is, used, a, dashpot, is, a, piston, filled, with, fluid, that, is, allowed, to, escape, slowly, both, air, filled, and, oil, filled, dashpots, are, used, the, time, period, can, be, varied, by, increasing, or, decreasing, the, flow, rate, for, longer, time, periods, a, mechanical, clockwork, timer, is, installed, relays, may, be, arranged, for, a, fixed, timing, period, or, may, be, field, adjustable, or, remotely, set, from, a, control, panel, modern, microprocessor, based, timing, relays, provide, precision, timing, over, a, great, range, some, relays, are, constructed, with, a, kind, of, shock, absorber, mechanism, attached, to, the, armature, which, prevents, immediate, full, motion, when, the, coil, is, either, energized, or, de, energized, this, addition, gives, the, relay, the, property, of, time, delay, actuation, time, delay, relays, can, be, constructed, to, delay, armature, motion, on, coil, energization, de, energization, or, both, time, delay, relay, contacts, must, be, specified, not, only, as, either, normally, open, or, normally, closed, but, whether, the, delay, operates, in, the, direction, of, closing, or, in, the, direction, of, opening, the, following, is, a, description, of, the, four, basic, types, of, time, delay, relay, contacts, first, we, have, the, normally, open, timed, closed, notc, contact, this, type, of, contact, is, normally, open, when, the, coil, is, unpowered, de, energized, the, contact, is, closed, by, the, application, of, power, to, the, relay, coil, but, only, after, the, coil, has, been, continuously, powered, for, the, specified, amount, of, time, in, other, words, the, direction, of, the, contact, s, motion, either, to, close, or, to, open, is, identical, to, a, regular, no, contact, but, there, is, a, delay, in, closing, direction, because, the, delay, occurs, in, the, direction, of, coil, energization, this, type, of, contact, is, alternatively, known, as, a, normally, open, on, delay, a, vacuum, relay, is, a, sensitive, relay, having, its, contacts, mounted, in, an, evacuated, glass, housing, to, permit, handling, radio, frequency, voltages, as, high, as, 20, 000, volts, without, flashover, between, contacts, even, though, contact, spacing, is, as, low, as, a, few, hundredths, of, an, inch, when, open, relays, are, used, wherever, it, is, necessary, to, control, a, high, power, or, high, voltage, circuit, with, a, low, power, circuit, especially, when, galvanic, isolation, is, desirable, the, first, application, of, relays, was, in, long, telegraph, lines, whereas, the, weak, signal, received, at, an, intermediate, station, could, control, a, contact, regenerating, the, signal, for, further, transmission, high, voltage, or, high, current, devices, can, be, controlled, with, small, low, voltage, wiring, and, pilots, switches, operators, can, be, isolated, from, the, high, voltage, circuit, low, power, devices, such, as, microprocessors, can, drive, relays, to, control, electrical, loads, beyond, their, direct, drive, capability, in, an, automobile, a, starter, relay, allows, the, high, current, of, the, cranking, motor, to, be, controlled, with, small, wiring, and, contacts, in, the, ignition, key, electromechanical, switching, systems, including, strowger, and, crossbar, telephone, exchanges, made, extensive, use, of, relays, in, ancillary, control, circuits, the, relay, automatic, telephone, company, also, manufactured, telephone, exchanges, based, solely, on, relay, switching, techniques, designed, by, gotthilf, ansgarius, betulander, the, first, public, relay, based, telephone, exchange, in, the, uk, was, installed, in, fleetwood, on, 15, july, 1922, and, remained, in, service, until, 1959, the, use, of, relays, for, the, logical, control, of, complex, switching, systems, like, telephone, exchanges, was, studied, by, claude, shannon, who, formalized, the, application, of, boolean, algebra, to, relay, circuit, design, in, a, symbolic, analysis, of, relay, and, switching, circuits, relays, can, perform, the, basic, operations, of, boolean, combinatorial, logic, for, example, the, boolean, and, function, is, realised, by, connecting, normally, open, relay, contacts, in, series, the, or, function, by, connecting, normally, open, contacts, in, parallel, inversion, of, a, logical, input, can, be, done, with, a, normally, closed, contact, relays, were, used, for, control, of, automated, systems, for, machine, tools, and, production, lines, the, ladder, programming, language, is, often, used, for, designing, relay, logic, networks, early, electro, mechanical, computers, such, as, the, arra, harvard, mark, ii, zuse, z2, and, zuse, z3, used, relays, for, logic, and, working, registers, however, electronic, devices, proved, faster, and, easier, to, use, relays, are, much, more, resistant, than, semiconductors, to, nuclear, radiation, so, they, are, widely, used, in, safety, critical, logic, such, as, the, control, panels, of, radioactive, waste, handling, machinery, electromechanical, protective, relays, are, used, to, detect, overload, and, other, faults, on, electrical, lines, by, opening, and, closing, circuit, breakers, for, protection, of, electrical, apparatus, and, transmission, lines, electromechanical, relays, with, accurate, operating, characteristics, were, used, to, detect, overload, short, circuits, and, other, faults, while, many, such, relays, remain, in, use, digital, protective, relays, now, provide, equivalent, and, more, complex, protective, functions, railway, signalling, relays, are, large, considering, the, mostly, small, voltages, less, than, 120, v, and, currents, perhaps, 100, ma, that, they, switch, contacts, are, widely, spaced, to, prevent, flashovers, and, short, circuits, over, a, lifetime, that, may, exceed, fifty, years, since, rail, signal, circuits, must, be, highly, reliable, special, techniques, are, used, to, detect, and, prevent, failures, in, the, relay, system, to, protect, against, false, feeds, double, switching, relay, contacts, are, often, used, on, both, the, positive, and, negative, side, of, a, circuit, so, that, two, false, feeds, are, needed, to, cause, a, false, signal, not, all, relay, circuits, can, be, proved, so, there, is, reliance, on, construction, features, such, as, carbon, to, silver, contacts, to, resist, lightning, induced, contact, welding, and, to, provide, ac, immunity, opto, isolators, are, also, used, in, some, instances, with, railway, signalling, especially, where, only, a, single, contact, is, to, be, switched, selection, of, an, appropriate, relay, for, a, particular, application, requires, evaluation, of, many, different, factors, there, are, many, considerations, involved, in, the, correct, selection, of, a, control, relay, for, a, particular, application, including, factors, such, as, speed, of, operation, sensitivity, and, hysteresis, although, typical, control, relays, operate, in, the, 5, ms, to, 20, ms, range, relays, with, switching, speeds, as, fast, as, 100, s, are, available, reed, relays, which, are, actuated, by, low, currents, and, switch, fast, are, suitable, for, controlling, small, currents, as, with, any, switch, the, contact, current, unrelated, to, the, coil, current, must, not, exceed, a, given, value, to, avoid, damage, in, high, inductance, circuits, such, as, motors, other, issues, must, be, addressed, when, an, inductance, is, connected, to, a, power, source, an, input, surge, current, or, electromotor, starting, current, larger, than, the, steady, state, current, exists, when, the, circuit, is, broken, the, current, cannot, change, instantaneously, which, creates, a, potentially, damaging, arc, across, the, separating, contacts, consequently, for, relays, used, to, control, inductive, loads, we, must, specify, the, maximum, current, that, may, flow, through, the, relay, contacts, when, it, actuates, the, make, rating, the, continuous, rating, and, the, break, rating, the, make, rating, may, be, several, times, larger, than, the, continuous, rating, which, is, larger, than, the, break, rating, switching, while, wet, under, load, causes, undesired, arcing, between, the, contacts, eventually, leading, to, contacts, that, weld, shut, or, contacts, that, fail, due, to, a, buildup, of, surface, damage, caused, by, the, destructive, arc, energy, inside, the, number, one, electronic, switching, system, 1ess, crossbar, switch, and, certain, other, high, reliability, designs, the, reed, switches, are, always, switched, dry, without, load, to, avoid, that, problem, leading, to, much, longer, contact, life, without, adequate, contact, protection, the, occurrence, of, electric, current, arcing, causes, significant, degradation, of, the, contacts, which, suffer, significant, and, visible, damage, every, time, the, relay, contacts, open, or, close, under, load, an, electrical, arc, can, occur, between, the, contacts, of, the, relay, either, a, break, arc, when, opening, or, a, make, bounce, arc, when, closing, in, many, situations, the, break, arc, is, more, energetic, and, thus, more, destructive, in, particular, with, inductive, loads, but, this, can, be, mitigated, by, bridging, the, contacts, with, a, snubber, circuit, the, inrush, current, of, tungsten, filament, incandescent, lamps, is, typically, ten, times, the, normal, operating, current, thus, relays, intended, for, tungsten, loads, may, use, special, contact, composition, or, the, relay, may, have, lower, contact, ratings, for, tungsten, loads, than, for, purely, resistive, loads, an, electrical, arc, across, relay, contacts, can, be, very, hot, thousands, of, degrees, fahrenheit, causing, the, metal, on, the, contact, surfaces, to, melt, pool, and, migrate, with, the, current, the, extremely, high, temperature, of, the, arc, splits, the, surrounding, gas, molecules, creating, ozone, carbon, monoxide, and, other, compounds, over, time, the, arc, energy, slowly, destroys, the, contact, metal, causing, some, material, to, escape, into, the, air, as, fine, particulate, matter, this, action, causes, the, material, in, the, contacts, to, degrade, and, coordination, resulting, in, device, failure, this, contact, degradation, drastically, limits, the, overall, life, of, a, relay, to, a, range, of, about, 10, 000, to, 100, 000, operations, a, level, far, below, the, mechanical, life, of, the, device, which, can, be, in, excess, of, 20, million, operations
