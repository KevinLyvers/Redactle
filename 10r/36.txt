a, genetically, modified, organism, gmo, is, any, organism, whose, genetic, material, has, been, altered, using, genetic, engineering, techniques, the, exact, definition, of, a, genetically, modified, organism, and, what, constitutes, genetic, engineering, varies, with, the, most, common, being, an, organism, altered, in, a, way, that, does, not, occur, naturally, by, mating, and, or, natural, recombination, a, wide, variety, of, organisms, have, been, genetically, modified, gm, including, animals, plants, and, microorganisms, genetic, modification, can, include, the, introduction, of, new, genes, or, enhancing, altering, or, knocking, out, endogenous, genes, in, some, genetic, modifications, genes, are, transferred, within, the, same, species, across, species, creating, transgenic, organisms, and, even, across, kingdoms, creating, a, genetically, modified, organism, is, a, multi, step, process, genetic, engineers, must, isolate, the, gene, they, wish, to, insert, into, the, host, organism, and, combine, it, with, other, genetic, elements, including, a, promoter, and, terminator, region, and, often, a, selectable, marker, a, number, of, techniques, are, available, for, inserting, the, isolated, gene, into, the, host, genome, recent, advancements, using, genome, editing, techniques, notably, crispr, have, made, the, production, of, gmos, much, simpler, herbert, boyer, and, stanley, cohen, made, the, first, genetically, modified, organism, in, 1973, a, bacterium, resistant, to, the, antibiotic, kanamycin, the, first, genetically, modified, animal, a, mouse, was, created, in, 1974, by, rudolf, jaenisch, and, the, first, plant, was, produced, in, 1983, in, 1994, the, flavr, savr, tomato, was, released, the, first, commercialized, genetically, modified, food, the, first, genetically, modified, animal, to, be, commercialized, was, the, glofish, 2003, and, the, first, genetically, modified, animal, to, be, approved, for, food, use, was, the, aquadvantage, salmon, in, 2015, bacteria, are, the, easiest, organisms, to, engineer, and, have, been, used, for, research, food, production, industrial, protein, purification, including, drugs, agriculture, and, art, there, is, potential, to, use, them, for, environmental, purposes, or, as, medicine, fungi, have, been, engineered, with, much, the, same, goals, viruses, play, an, important, role, as, vectors, for, inserting, genetic, information, into, other, organisms, this, use, is, especially, relevant, to, human, gene, therapy, there, are, proposals, to, remove, the, virulent, genes, from, viruses, to, create, vaccines, plants, have, been, engineered, for, scientific, research, to, create, new, colors, in, plants, deliver, vaccines, and, to, create, enhanced, crops, genetically, modified, crops, are, publicly, the, most, controversial, gmos, in, spite, of, having, the, most, human, health, and, environmental, benefits, animals, are, generally, much, harder, to, transform, and, the, vast, majority, are, still, at, the, research, stage, mammals, are, the, best, model, organisms, for, humans, livestock, is, modified, with, the, intention, of, improving, economically, important, traits, such, as, growth, rate, quality, of, meat, milk, composition, disease, resistance, and, survival, genetically, modified, fish, are, used, for, scientific, research, as, pets, and, as, a, food, source, genetic, engineering, has, been, proposed, as, a, way, to, control, mosquitos, a, vector, for, many, deadly, diseases, although, human, gene, therapy, is, still, relatively, new, it, has, been, used, to, treat, genetic, disorders, such, as, severe, combined, immunodeficiency, and, leber, s, congenital, amaurosis, many, objections, have, been, raised, over, the, development, of, gmos, particularly, their, commercialization, many, of, these, involve, gm, crops, and, whether, food, produced, from, them, is, safe, and, what, impact, growing, them, will, have, on, the, environment, other, concerns, are, the, objectivity, and, rigor, of, regulatory, authorities, contamination, of, non, genetically, modified, food, control, of, the, food, supply, patenting, of, life, and, the, use, of, intellectual, property, rights, although, there, is, a, scientific, consensus, that, currently, available, food, derived, from, gm, crops, poses, no, greater, risk, to, human, health, than, conventional, food, gm, food, safety, is, a, leading, issue, with, critics, gene, flow, impact, on, non, target, organisms, and, escape, are, the, major, environmental, concerns, countries, have, adopted, regulatory, measures, to, deal, with, these, concerns, there, are, differences, in, the, regulation, for, the, release, of, gmos, between, countries, with, some, of, the, most, marked, differences, occurring, between, the, us, and, europe, key, issues, concerning, regulators, include, whether, gm, food, should, be, labeled, and, the, status, of, gene, edited, organisms, the, definition, of, a, genetically, modified, organism, gmo, is, not, clear, and, varies, widely, between, countries, international, bodies, and, other, communities, at, its, broadest, the, definition, of, a, gmo, can, include, anything, that, has, had, its, genes, altered, including, by, nature, taking, a, less, broad, view, it, can, encompass, every, organism, that, has, had, its, genes, altered, by, humans, which, would, include, all, crops, and, livestock, in, 1993, the, encyclopedia, britannica, defined, genetic, engineering, as, any, of, a, wide, range, of, techniques, among, them, artificial, insemination, in, vitro, fertilization, e, g, test, tube, babies, sperm, banks, cloning, and, gene, manipulation, the, european, union, eu, included, a, similarly, broad, definition, in, early, reviews, specifically, mentioning, gmos, being, produced, by, selective, breeding, and, other, means, of, artificial, selection, these, definitions, were, promptly, adjusted, with, a, number, of, exceptions, added, as, the, result, of, pressure, from, scientific, and, farming, communities, as, well, as, developments, in, science, the, eu, definition, later, excluded, traditional, breeding, in, vitro, fertilization, induction, of, polyploidy, mutation, breeding, and, cell, fusion, techniques, that, do, not, use, recombinant, nucleic, acids, or, a, genetically, modified, organism, in, the, process, another, approach, was, the, definition, provided, by, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, the, world, health, organization, and, the, european, commission, stating, that, the, organisms, must, be, altered, in, a, way, that, does, not, occur, naturally, by, mating, and, or, natural, recombination, progress, in, science, such, as, the, discovery, of, horizontal, gene, transfer, being, a, relatively, common, natural, phenomenon, further, added, to, the, confusion, on, what, occurs, naturally, which, led, to, further, adjustments, and, exceptions, there, are, examples, of, crops, that, fit, this, definition, but, are, not, normally, considered, gmos, for, example, the, grain, crop, triticale, was, fully, developed, in, a, laboratory, in, 1930, using, various, techniques, to, alter, its, genome, genetically, engineered, organism, geo, can, be, considered, a, more, precise, term, compared, to, gmo, when, describing, organisms, genomes, that, have, been, directly, manipulated, with, biotechnology, the, cartagena, protocol, on, biosafety, used, the, synonym, living, modified, organism, lmo, in, 2000, and, defined, it, as, any, living, organism, that, possesses, a, novel, combination, of, genetic, material, obtained, through, the, use, of, modern, biotechnology, modern, biotechnology, is, further, defined, as, in, vitro, nucleic, acid, techniques, including, recombinant, deoxyribonucleic, acid, dna, and, direct, injection, of, nucleic, acid, into, cells, or, organelles, or, fusion, of, cells, beyond, the, taxonomic, family, originally, the, term, gmo, was, not, commonly, used, by, scientists, to, describe, genetically, engineered, organisms, until, after, usage, of, gmo, became, common, in, popular, media, the, united, states, department, of, agriculture, usda, considers, gmos, to, be, plants, or, animals, with, heritable, changes, introduced, by, genetic, engineering, or, traditional, methods, while, geo, specifically, refers, to, organisms, with, genes, introduced, eliminated, or, rearranged, using, molecular, biology, particularly, recombinant, dna, techniques, such, as, transgenesis, the, definitions, focus, on, the, process, more, than, the, product, which, means, there, could, be, gmos, and, non, gmos, with, very, similar, genotypes, and, phenotypes, this, has, led, scientists, to, label, it, as, a, scientifically, meaningless, category, saying, that, it, is, impossible, to, group, all, the, different, types, of, gmos, under, one, common, definition, it, has, also, caused, issues, for, organic, institutions, and, groups, looking, to, ban, gmos, it, also, poses, problems, as, new, processes, are, developed, the, current, definitions, came, in, before, genome, editing, became, popular, and, there, is, some, confusion, as, to, whether, they, are, gmos, the, eu, has, adjudged, that, they, are, changing, their, gmo, definition, to, include, organisms, obtained, by, mutagenesis, but, has, excluded, them, from, regulation, based, on, their, long, safety, record, and, that, they, have, been, conventionally, been, used, in, a, number, of, applications, in, contrast, the, usda, has, ruled, that, gene, edited, organisms, are, not, considered, gmos, even, greater, inconsistency, and, confusion, is, associated, with, various, non, gmo, or, gmo, free, labeling, schemes, in, food, marketing, where, even, products, such, as, water, or, salt, which, do, not, contain, any, organic, substances, and, genetic, material, and, thus, cannot, be, genetically, modified, by, definition, are, being, labeled, to, create, an, impression, of, being, more, healthy, creating, a, genetically, modified, organism, gmo, is, a, multi, step, process, genetic, engineers, must, isolate, the, gene, they, wish, to, insert, into, the, host, organism, this, gene, can, be, taken, from, a, cell, or, artificially, synthesized, if, the, chosen, gene, or, the, donor, organism, s, genome, has, been, well, studied, it, may, already, be, accessible, from, a, genetic, library, the, gene, is, then, combined, with, other, genetic, elements, including, a, promoter, and, terminator, region, and, a, selectable, marker, a, number, of, techniques, are, available, for, inserting, the, isolated, gene, into, the, host, genome, bacteria, can, be, induced, to, take, up, foreign, dna, usually, by, exposed, heat, shock, or, electroporation, dna, is, generally, inserted, into, animal, cells, using, microinjection, where, it, can, be, injected, through, the, cell, s, nuclear, envelope, directly, into, the, nucleus, or, through, the, use, of, viral, vectors, in, plants, the, dna, is, often, inserted, using, agrobacterium, mediated, recombination, biolistics, or, electroporation, as, only, a, single, cell, is, transformed, with, genetic, material, the, organism, must, be, regenerated, from, that, single, cell, in, plants, this, is, accomplished, through, tissue, culture, in, animals, it, is, necessary, to, ensure, that, the, inserted, dna, is, present, in, the, embryonic, stem, cells, further, testing, using, pcr, southern, hybridization, and, dna, sequencing, is, conducted, to, confirm, that, an, organism, contains, the, new, gene, traditionally, the, new, genetic, material, was, inserted, randomly, within, the, host, genome, gene, targeting, techniques, which, creates, double, stranded, breaks, and, takes, advantage, on, the, cells, natural, homologous, recombination, repair, systems, have, been, developed, to, target, insertion, to, exact, locations, genome, editing, uses, artificially, engineered, nucleases, that, create, breaks, at, specific, points, there, are, four, families, of, engineered, nucleases, meganucleases, zinc, finger, nucleases, transcription, activator, like, effector, nucleases, talens, and, the, cas9, guiderna, system, adapted, from, crispr, talen, and, crispr, are, the, two, most, commonly, used, and, each, has, its, own, advantages, talens, have, greater, target, specificity, while, crispr, is, easier, to, design, and, more, efficient, humans, have, domesticated, plants, and, animals, since, around, 12, 000, bce, using, selective, breeding, or, artificial, selection, as, contrasted, with, natural, selection, 25, the, process, of, selective, breeding, in, which, organisms, with, desired, traits, and, thus, with, the, desired, genes, are, used, to, breed, the, next, generation, and, organisms, lacking, the, trait, are, not, bred, is, a, precursor, to, the, modern, concept, of, genetic, modification, 1, 1, various, advancements, in, genetics, allowed, humans, to, directly, alter, the, dna, and, therefore, genes, of, organisms, in, 1972, paul, berg, created, the, first, recombinant, dna, molecule, when, he, combined, dna, from, a, monkey, virus, with, that, of, the, lambda, virus, herbert, boyer, and, stanley, cohen, made, the, first, genetically, modified, organism, in, 1973, they, took, a, gene, from, a, bacterium, that, provided, resistance, to, the, antibiotic, kanamycin, inserted, it, into, a, plasmid, and, then, induced, other, bacteria, to, incorporate, the, plasmid, the, bacteria, that, had, successfully, incorporated, the, plasmid, was, then, able, to, survive, in, the, presence, of, kanamycin, boyer, and, cohen, expressed, other, genes, in, bacteria, this, included, genes, from, the, toad, xenopus, laevis, in, 1974, creating, the, first, gmo, expressing, a, gene, from, an, organism, of, a, different, kingdom, in, 1974, rudolf, jaenisch, created, a, transgenic, mouse, by, introducing, foreign, dna, into, its, embryo, making, it, the, world, s, first, transgenic, animal, however, it, took, another, eight, years, before, transgenic, mice, were, developed, that, passed, the, transgene, to, their, offspring, genetically, modified, mice, were, created, in, 1984, that, carried, cloned, oncogenes, predisposing, them, to, developing, cancer, mice, with, genes, removed, termed, a, knockout, mouse, were, created, in, 1989, the, first, transgenic, livestock, were, produced, in, 1985, and, the, first, animal, to, synthesize, transgenic, proteins, in, their, milk, were, mice, in, 1987, the, mice, were, engineered, to, produce, human, tissue, plasminogen, activator, a, protein, involved, in, breaking, down, blood, clots, in, 1983, the, first, genetically, engineered, plant, was, developed, by, michael, w, bevan, richard, b, flavell, and, mary, dell, chilton, they, infected, tobacco, with, agrobacterium, transformed, with, an, antibiotic, resistance, gene, and, through, tissue, culture, techniques, were, able, to, grow, a, new, plant, containing, the, resistance, gene, the, gene, gun, was, invented, in, 1987, allowing, transformation, of, plants, not, susceptible, to, agrobacterium, infection, in, 2000, vitamin, a, enriched, golden, rice, was, the, first, plant, developed, with, increased, nutrient, value, in, 1976, genentech, the, first, genetic, engineering, company, was, founded, by, herbert, boyer, and, robert, swanson, a, year, later, the, company, produced, a, human, protein, somatostatin, in, e, coli, genentech, announced, the, production, of, genetically, engineered, human, insulin, in, 1978, the, insulin, produced, by, bacteria, branded, humulin, was, approved, for, release, by, the, food, and, drug, administration, in, 1982, in, 1988, the, first, human, antibodies, were, produced, in, plants, in, 1987, a, strain, of, pseudomonas, syringae, became, the, first, genetically, modified, organism, to, be, released, into, the, environment, when, a, strawberry, and, potato, field, in, california, were, sprayed, with, it, the, first, genetically, modified, crop, an, antibiotic, resistant, tobacco, plant, was, produced, in, 1982, china, was, the, first, country, to, commercialize, transgenic, plants, introducing, a, virus, resistant, tobacco, in, 1992, in, 1994, calgene, attained, approval, to, commercially, release, the, flavr, savr, tomato, the, first, genetically, modified, food, also, in, 1994, the, european, union, approved, tobacco, engineered, to, be, resistant, to, the, herbicide, bromoxynil, making, it, the, first, genetically, engineered, crop, commercialized, in, europe, an, insect, resistant, potato, was, approved, for, release, in, the, us, in, 1995, and, by, 1996, approval, had, been, granted, to, commercially, grow, 8, transgenic, crops, and, one, flower, crop, carnation, in, 6, countries, plus, the, eu, in, 2010, scientists, at, the, j, craig, venter, institute, announced, that, they, had, created, the, first, synthetic, bacterial, genome, they, named, it, synthia, and, it, was, the, world, s, first, synthetic, life, form, the, first, genetically, modified, animal, to, be, commercialized, was, the, glofish, a, zebra, fish, with, a, fluorescent, gene, added, that, allows, it, to, glow, in, the, dark, under, ultraviolet, light, it, was, released, to, the, us, market, in, 2003, in, 2015, aquadvantage, salmon, became, the, first, genetically, modified, animal, to, be, approved, for, food, use, approval, is, for, fish, raised, in, panama, and, sold, in, the, us, the, salmon, were, transformed, with, a, growth, hormone, regulating, gene, from, a, pacific, chinook, salmon, and, a, promoter, from, an, ocean, pout, enabling, it, to, grow, year, round, instead, of, only, during, spring, and, summer, bacteria, were, the, first, organisms, to, be, genetically, modified, in, the, laboratory, due, to, the, relative, ease, of, modifying, their, chromosomes, this, ease, made, them, important, tools, for, the, creation, of, other, gmos, genes, and, other, genetic, information, from, a, wide, range, of, organisms, can, be, added, to, a, plasmid, and, inserted, into, bacteria, for, storage, and, modification, bacteria, are, cheap, easy, to, grow, clonal, multiply, quickly, and, can, be, stored, at, 80, c, almost, indefinitely, once, a, gene, is, isolated, it, can, be, stored, inside, the, bacteria, providing, an, unlimited, supply, for, research, a, large, number, of, custom, plasmids, make, manipulating, dna, extracted, from, bacteria, relatively, easy, their, ease, of, use, has, made, them, great, tools, for, scientists, looking, to, study, gene, function, and, evolution, the, simplest, model, organisms, come, from, bacteria, with, most, of, our, early, understanding, of, molecular, biology, coming, from, studying, escherichia, coli, scientists, can, easily, manipulate, and, combine, genes, within, the, bacteria, to, create, novel, or, disrupted, proteins, and, observe, the, effect, this, has, on, various, molecular, systems, researchers, have, combined, the, genes, from, bacteria, and, archaea, leading, to, insights, on, how, these, two, diverged, in, the, past, in, the, field, of, synthetic, biology, they, have, been, used, to, test, various, synthetic, approaches, from, synthesizing, genomes, to, creating, novel, nucleotides, bacteria, have, been, used, in, the, production, of, food, for, a, long, time, and, specific, strains, have, been, developed, and, selected, for, that, work, on, an, industrial, scale, they, can, be, used, to, produce, enzymes, amino, acids, flavorings, and, other, compounds, used, in, food, production, with, the, advent, of, genetic, engineering, new, genetic, changes, can, easily, be, introduced, into, these, bacteria, most, food, producing, bacteria, are, lactic, acid, bacteria, and, this, is, where, the, majority, of, research, into, genetically, engineering, food, producing, bacteria, has, gone, the, bacteria, can, be, modified, to, operate, more, efficiently, reduce, toxic, byproduct, production, increase, output, create, improved, compounds, and, remove, unnecessary, pathways, food, products, from, genetically, modified, bacteria, include, alpha, amylase, which, converts, starch, to, simple, sugars, chymosin, which, clots, milk, protein, for, cheese, making, and, pectinesterase, which, improves, fruit, juice, clarity, the, majority, are, produced, in, the, us, and, even, though, regulations, are, in, place, to, allow, production, in, europe, as, of, 2015, no, food, products, derived, from, bacteria, are, currently, available, there, genetically, modified, bacteria, are, used, to, produce, large, amounts, of, proteins, for, industrial, use, the, bacteria, are, generally, grown, to, a, large, volume, before, the, gene, encoding, the, protein, is, activated, the, bacteria, are, then, harvested, and, the, desired, protein, purified, from, them, the, high, cost, of, extraction, and, purification, has, meant, that, only, high, value, products, have, been, produced, at, an, industrial, scale, the, majority, of, these, products, are, human, proteins, for, use, in, medicine, many, of, these, proteins, are, impossible, or, difficult, to, obtain, via, natural, methods, and, they, are, less, likely, to, be, contaminated, with, pathogens, making, them, safer, the, first, medicinal, use, of, gm, bacteria, was, to, produce, the, protein, insulin, to, treat, diabetes, other, medicines, produced, include, clotting, factors, to, treat, hemophilia, human, growth, hormone, to, treat, various, forms, of, dwarfism, interferon, to, treat, some, cancers, erythropoietin, for, anemic, patients, and, tissue, plasminogen, activator, which, dissolves, blood, clots, outside, of, medicine, they, have, been, used, to, produce, biofuels, there, is, interest, in, developing, an, extracellular, expression, system, within, the, bacteria, to, reduce, costs, and, make, the, production, of, more, products, economical, with, a, greater, understanding, of, the, role, that, the, microbiome, plays, in, human, health, there, is, a, potential, to, treat, diseases, by, genetically, altering, the, bacteria, to, themselves, be, therapeutic, agents, ideas, include, altering, gut, bacteria, so, they, destroy, harmful, bacteria, or, using, bacteria, to, replace, or, increase, deficient, enzymes, or, proteins, one, research, focus, is, to, modify, lactobacillus, bacteria, that, naturally, provide, some, protection, against, hiv, with, genes, that, will, further, enhance, this, protection, if, the, bacteria, do, not, form, colonies, inside, the, patient, the, person, must, repeatedly, ingest, the, modified, bacteria, in, order, to, get, the, required, doses, enabling, the, bacteria, to, form, a, colony, could, provide, a, more, long, term, solution, but, could, also, raise, safety, concerns, as, interactions, between, bacteria, and, the, human, body, are, less, well, understood, than, with, traditional, drugs, there, are, concerns, that, horizontal, gene, transfer, to, other, bacteria, could, have, unknown, effects, as, of, 2018, there, are, clinical, trials, underway, testing, the, efficacy, and, safety, of, these, treatments, for, over, a, century, bacteria, have, been, used, in, agriculture, crops, have, been, inoculated, with, rhizobia, and, more, recently, azospirillum, to, increase, their, production, or, to, allow, them, to, be, grown, outside, their, original, habitat, application, of, bacillus, thuringiensis, bt, and, other, bacteria, can, help, protect, crops, from, insect, infestation, and, plant, diseases, with, advances, in, genetic, engineering, these, bacteria, have, been, manipulated, for, increased, efficiency, and, expanded, host, range, markers, have, also, been, added, to, aid, in, tracing, the, spread, of, the, bacteria, the, bacteria, that, naturally, colonize, certain, crops, have, also, been, modified, in, some, cases, to, express, the, bt, genes, responsible, for, pest, resistance, pseudomonas, strains, of, bacteria, cause, frost, damage, by, nucleating, water, into, ice, crystals, around, themselves, this, led, to, the, development, of, ice, minus, bacteria, which, have, the, ice, forming, genes, removed, when, applied, to, crops, they, can, compete, with, the, non, modified, bacteria, and, confer, some, frost, resistance, other, uses, for, genetically, modified, bacteria, include, bioremediation, where, the, bacteria, are, used, to, convert, pollutants, into, a, less, toxic, form, genetic, engineering, can, increase, the, levels, of, the, enzymes, used, to, degrade, a, toxin, or, to, make, the, bacteria, more, stable, under, environmental, conditions, bioart, has, also, been, created, using, genetically, modified, bacteria, in, the, 1980s, artist, jon, davis, and, geneticist, dana, boyd, converted, the, germanic, symbol, for, femininity, into, binary, code, and, then, into, a, dna, sequence, which, was, then, expressed, in, escherichia, coli, this, was, taken, a, step, further, in, 2012, when, a, whole, book, was, encoded, onto, dna, paintings, have, also, been, produced, using, bacteria, transformed, with, fluorescent, proteins, viruses, are, often, modified, so, they, can, be, used, as, vectors, for, inserting, genetic, information, into, other, organisms, this, process, is, called, transduction, and, if, successful, the, recipient, of, the, introduced, dna, becomes, a, gmo, different, viruses, have, different, efficiencies, and, capabilities, researchers, can, use, this, to, control, for, various, factors, including, the, target, location, insert, size, and, duration, of, gene, expression, any, dangerous, sequences, inherent, in, the, virus, must, be, removed, while, those, that, allow, the, gene, to, be, delivered, effectively, are, retained, while, viral, vectors, can, be, used, to, insert, dna, into, almost, any, organism, it, is, especially, relevant, for, its, potential, in, treating, human, disease, although, primarily, still, at, trial, stages, there, has, been, some, successes, using, gene, therapy, to, replace, defective, genes, this, is, most, evident, in, curing, patients, with, severe, combined, immunodeficiency, rising, from, adenosine, deaminase, deficiency, ada, scid, although, the, development, of, leukemia, in, some, ada, scid, patients, along, with, the, death, of, jesse, gelsinger, in, a, 1999, trial, set, back, the, development, of, this, approach, for, many, years, in, 2009, another, breakthrough, was, achieved, when, an, eight, year, old, boy, with, leber, s, congenital, amaurosis, regained, normal, eyesight, and, in, 2016, glaxosmithkline, gained, approval, to, commercialize, a, gene, therapy, treatment, for, ada, scid, as, of, 2018, there, are, a, substantial, number, of, clinical, trials, underway, including, treatments, for, hemophilia, glioblastoma, chronic, granulomatous, disease, cystic, fibrosis, and, various, cancers, the, most, common, virus, used, for, gene, delivery, comes, from, adenoviruses, as, they, can, carry, up, to, 7, 5, kb, of, foreign, dna, and, infect, a, relatively, broad, range, of, host, cells, although, they, have, been, known, to, elicit, immune, responses, in, the, host, and, only, provide, short, term, expression, other, common, vectors, are, adeno, associated, viruses, which, have, lower, toxicity, and, longer, term, expression, but, can, only, carry, about, 4kb, of, dna, herpes, simplex, viruses, make, promising, vectors, having, a, carrying, capacity, of, over, 30kb, and, providing, long, term, expression, although, they, are, less, efficient, at, gene, delivery, than, other, vectors, the, best, vectors, for, long, term, integration, of, the, gene, into, the, host, genome, are, retroviruses, but, their, propensity, for, random, integration, is, problematic, lentiviruses, are, a, part, of, the, same, family, as, retroviruses, with, the, advantage, of, infecting, both, dividing, and, non, dividing, cells, whereas, retroviruses, only, target, dividing, cells, other, viruses, that, have, been, used, as, vectors, include, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, measles, viruses, rhabdoviruses, newcastle, disease, virus, poxviruses, and, picornaviruses, most, vaccines, consist, of, viruses, that, have, been, attenuated, disabled, weakened, or, killed, in, some, way, so, that, their, virulent, properties, are, no, longer, effective, genetic, engineering, could, theoretically, be, used, to, create, viruses, with, the, virulent, genes, removed, this, does, not, affect, the, viruses, infectivity, invokes, a, natural, immune, response, and, there, is, no, chance, that, they, will, regain, their, virulence, function, which, can, occur, with, some, other, vaccines, as, such, they, are, generally, considered, safer, and, more, efficient, than, conventional, vaccines, although, concerns, remain, over, non, target, infection, potential, side, effects, and, horizontal, gene, transfer, to, other, viruses, another, potential, approach, is, to, use, vectors, to, create, novel, vaccines, for, diseases, that, have, no, vaccines, available, or, the, vaccines, that, do, not, work, effectively, such, as, aids, malaria, and, tuberculosis, the, most, effective, vaccine, against, tuberculosis, the, bacillus, calmette, gu, rin, bcg, vaccine, only, provides, partial, protection, a, modified, vaccine, expressing, a, m, tuberculosis, antigen, is, able, to, enhance, bcg, protection, it, has, been, shown, to, be, safe, to, use, at, phase, ii, trials, although, not, as, effective, as, initially, hoped, other, vector, based, vaccines, have, already, been, approved, and, many, more, are, being, developed, another, potential, use, of, genetically, modified, viruses, is, to, alter, them, so, they, can, directly, treat, diseases, this, can, be, through, expression, of, protective, proteins, or, by, directly, targeting, infected, cells, in, 2004, researchers, reported, that, a, genetically, modified, virus, that, exploits, the, selfish, behavior, of, cancer, cells, might, offer, an, alternative, way, of, killing, tumours, since, then, several, researchers, have, developed, genetically, modified, oncolytic, viruses, that, show, promise, as, treatments, for, various, types, of, cancer, in, 2017, researchers, genetically, modified, a, virus, to, express, spinach, defensin, proteins, the, virus, was, injected, into, orange, trees, to, combat, citrus, greening, disease, that, had, reduced, orange, production, by, 70, since, 2005, natural, viral, diseases, such, as, myxomatosis, and, rabbit, hemorrhagic, disease, have, been, used, to, help, control, pest, populations, over, time, the, surviving, pests, become, resistant, leading, researchers, to, look, at, alternative, methods, genetically, modified, viruses, that, make, the, target, animals, infertile, through, immunocontraception, have, been, created, in, the, laboratory, as, well, as, others, that, target, the, developmental, stage, of, the, animal, there, are, concerns, with, using, this, approach, regarding, virus, containment, and, cross, species, infection, sometimes, the, same, virus, can, be, modified, for, contrasting, purposes, genetic, modification, of, the, myxoma, virus, has, been, proposed, to, conserve, european, wild, rabbits, in, the, iberian, peninsula, and, to, help, regulate, them, in, australia, to, protect, the, iberian, species, from, viral, diseases, the, myxoma, virus, was, genetically, modified, to, immunize, the, rabbits, while, in, australia, the, same, myxoma, virus, was, genetically, modified, to, lower, fertility, in, the, australian, rabbit, population, outside, of, biology, scientists, have, used, a, genetically, modified, virus, to, construct, a, lithium, ion, battery, and, other, nanostructured, materials, it, is, possible, to, engineer, bacteriophages, to, express, modified, proteins, on, their, surface, and, join, them, up, in, specific, patterns, a, technique, called, phage, display, these, structures, have, potential, uses, for, energy, storage, and, generation, biosensing, and, tissue, regeneration, with, some, new, materials, currently, produced, including, quantum, dots, liquid, crystals, nanorings, and, nanofibres, the, battery, was, made, by, engineering, m13, bacteriaophages, so, they, would, coat, themselves, in, iron, phosphate, and, then, assemble, themselves, along, a, carbon, nanotube, this, created, a, highly, conductive, medium, for, use, in, a, cathode, allowing, energy, to, be, transferred, quickly, they, could, be, constructed, at, lower, temperatures, with, non, toxic, chemicals, making, them, more, environmentally, friendly, fungi, can, be, used, for, many, of, the, same, processes, as, bacteria, for, industrial, applications, yeasts, combine, the, bacterial, advantages, of, being, a, single, celled, organism, that, is, easy, to, manipulate, and, grow, with, the, advanced, protein, modifications, found, in, eukaryotes, they, can, be, used, to, produce, large, complex, molecules, for, use, in, food, pharmaceuticals, hormones, and, steroids, yeast, is, important, for, wine, production, and, as, of, 2016, two, genetically, modified, yeasts, involved, in, the, fermentation, of, wine, have, been, commercialized, in, the, united, states, and, canada, one, has, increased, malolactic, fermentation, efficiency, while, the, other, prevents, the, production, of, dangerous, ethyl, carbamate, compounds, during, fermentation, there, have, also, been, advances, in, the, production, of, biofuel, from, genetically, modified, fungi, fungi, being, the, most, common, pathogens, of, insects, make, attractive, biopesticides, unlike, bacteria, and, viruses, they, have, the, advantage, of, infecting, the, insects, by, contact, alone, although, they, are, out, competed, in, efficiency, by, chemical, pesticides, genetic, engineering, can, improve, virulence, usually, by, adding, more, virulent, proteins, increasing, infection, rate, or, enhancing, spore, persistence, many, of, the, disease, carrying, vectors, are, susceptible, to, entomopathogenic, fungi, an, attractive, target, for, biological, control, are, mosquitos, vectors, for, a, range, of, deadly, diseases, including, malaria, yellow, fever, and, dengue, fever, mosquitos, can, evolve, quickly, so, it, becomes, a, balancing, act, of, killing, them, before, the, plasmodium, they, carry, becomes, the, infectious, disease, but, not, so, fast, that, they, become, resistant, to, the, fungi, by, genetically, engineering, fungi, like, metarhizium, anisopliae, and, beauveria, bassiana, to, delay, the, development, of, mosquito, infectiousness, the, selection, pressure, to, evolve, resistance, is, reduced, another, strategy, is, to, add, proteins, to, the, fungi, that, block, transmission, of, malaria, or, remove, the, plasmodium, altogether, agaricus, bisporus, the, common, white, button, mushroom, has, been, gene, edited, to, resist, browning, giving, it, a, longer, shelf, life, the, process, used, crispr, to, knock, out, a, gene, that, encodes, polyphenol, oxidase, as, it, didn, t, introduce, any, foreign, dna, into, the, organism, it, was, not, deemed, to, be, regulated, under, existing, gmo, frameworks, and, as, such, is, the, first, crispr, edited, organism, to, be, approved, for, release, this, has, intensified, debates, as, to, whether, gene, edited, organisms, should, be, considered, genetically, modified, organisms, and, how, they, should, be, regulated, plants, have, been, engineered, for, scientific, research, to, display, new, flower, colors, deliver, vaccines, and, to, create, enhanced, crops, many, plants, are, pluripotent, meaning, that, a, single, cell, from, a, mature, plant, can, be, harvested, and, under, the, right, conditions, can, develop, into, a, new, plant, this, ability, can, be, taken, advantage, of, by, genetic, engineers, by, selecting, for, cells, that, have, been, successfully, transformed, in, an, adult, plant, a, new, plant, can, then, be, grown, that, contains, the, transgene, in, every, cell, through, a, process, known, as, tissue, culture, much, of, the, advances, in, the, field, of, genetic, engineering, has, come, from, experimentation, with, tobacco, major, advances, in, tissue, culture, and, plant, cellular, mechanisms, for, a, wide, range, of, plants, has, originated, from, systems, developed, in, tobacco, it, was, the, first, plant, to, be, altered, using, genetic, engineering, and, is, considered, a, model, organism, for, not, only, genetic, engineering, but, a, range, of, other, fields, as, such, the, transgenic, tools, and, procedures, are, well, established, making, tobacco, one, of, the, easiest, plants, to, transform, another, major, model, organism, relevant, to, genetic, engineering, is, arabidopsis, thaliana, its, small, genome, and, short, life, cycle, makes, it, easy, to, manipulate, and, it, contains, many, homologs, to, important, crop, species, it, was, the, first, plant, sequenced, has, a, host, of, online, resources, available, and, can, be, transformed, by, simply, dipping, a, flower, in, a, transformed, agrobacterium, solution, in, research, plants, are, engineered, to, help, discover, the, functions, of, certain, genes, the, simplest, way, to, do, this, is, to, remove, the, gene, and, see, what, phenotype, develops, compared, to, the, wild, type, form, any, differences, are, possibly, the, result, of, the, missing, gene, unlike, mutagenisis, genetic, engineering, allows, targeted, removal, without, disrupting, other, genes, in, the, organism, some, genes, are, only, expressed, in, certain, tissues, so, reporter, genes, like, gus, can, be, attached, to, the, gene, of, interest, allowing, visualization, of, the, location, other, ways, to, test, a, gene, is, to, alter, it, slightly, and, then, return, it, to, the, plant, and, see, if, it, still, has, the, same, effect, on, phenotype, other, strategies, include, attaching, the, gene, to, a, strong, promoter, and, see, what, happens, when, it, is, overexpressed, forcing, a, gene, to, be, expressed, in, a, different, location, or, at, different, developmental, stages, some, genetically, modified, plants, are, purely, ornamental, they, are, modified, for, flower, color, fragrance, flower, shape, and, plant, architecture, the, first, genetically, modified, ornamentals, commercialized, altered, color, carnations, were, released, in, 1997, with, the, most, popular, genetically, modified, organism, a, blue, rose, actually, lavender, or, mauve, created, in, 2004, the, roses, are, sold, in, japan, the, united, states, and, canada, other, genetically, modified, ornamentals, include, chrysanthemum, and, petunia, as, well, as, increasing, aesthetic, value, there, are, plans, to, develop, ornamentals, that, use, less, water, or, are, resistant, to, the, cold, which, would, allow, them, to, be, grown, outside, their, natural, environments, it, has, been, proposed, to, genetically, modify, some, plant, species, threatened, by, extinction, to, be, resistant, to, invasive, plants, and, diseases, such, as, the, emerald, ash, borer, in, north, american, and, the, fungal, disease, ceratocystis, platani, in, european, plane, trees, the, papaya, ringspot, virus, devastated, papaya, trees, in, hawaii, in, the, twentieth, century, until, transgenic, papaya, plants, were, given, pathogen, derived, resistance, however, genetic, modification, for, conservation, in, plants, remains, mainly, speculative, a, unique, concern, is, that, a, transgenic, species, may, no, longer, bear, enough, resemblance, to, the, original, species, to, truly, claim, that, the, original, species, is, being, conserved, instead, the, transgenic, species, may, be, genetically, different, enough, to, be, considered, a, new, species, thus, diminishing, the, conservation, worth, of, genetic, modification, genetically, modified, crops, are, genetically, modified, plants, that, are, used, in, agriculture, the, first, crops, developed, were, used, for, animal, or, human, food, and, provide, resistance, to, certain, pests, diseases, environmental, conditions, spoilage, or, chemical, treatments, e, g, resistance, to, a, herbicide, the, second, generation, of, crops, aimed, to, improve, the, quality, often, by, altering, the, nutrient, profile, third, generation, genetically, modified, crops, could, be, used, for, non, food, purposes, including, the, production, of, pharmaceutical, agents, biofuels, and, other, industrially, useful, goods, as, well, as, for, bioremediation, there, are, three, main, aims, to, agricultural, advancement, increased, production, improved, conditions, for, agricultural, workers, and, sustainability, gm, crops, contribute, by, improving, harvests, through, reducing, insect, pressure, increasing, nutrient, value, and, tolerating, different, abiotic, stresses, despite, this, potential, as, of, 2018, the, commercialized, crops, are, limited, mostly, to, cash, crops, like, cotton, soybean, maize, and, canola, and, the, vast, majority, of, the, introduced, traits, provide, either, herbicide, tolerance, or, insect, resistance, soybeans, accounted, for, half, of, all, genetically, modified, crops, planted, in, 2014, adoption, by, farmers, has, been, rapid, between, 1996, and, 2013, the, total, surface, area, of, land, cultivated, with, gm, crops, increased, by, a, factor, of, 100, geographically, though, the, spread, has, been, uneven, with, strong, growth, in, the, americas, and, parts, of, asia, and, little, in, europe, and, africa, its, socioeconomic, spread, has, been, more, even, with, approximately, 54, of, worldwide, gm, crops, grown, in, developing, countries, in, 2013, although, doubts, have, been, raised, most, studies, have, found, growing, gm, crops, to, be, beneficial, to, farmers, through, decreased, pesticide, use, as, well, as, increased, crop, yield, and, farm, profit, the, majority, of, gm, crops, have, been, modified, to, be, resistant, to, selected, herbicides, usually, a, glyphosate, or, glufosinate, based, one, genetically, modified, crops, engineered, to, resist, herbicides, are, now, more, available, than, conventionally, bred, resistant, varieties, in, the, usa, 93, of, soybeans, and, most, of, the, gm, maize, grown, is, glyphosate, tolerant, most, currently, available, genes, used, to, engineer, insect, resistance, come, from, the, bacillus, thuringiensis, bacterium, and, code, for, delta, endotoxins, a, few, use, the, genes, that, encode, for, vegetative, insecticidal, proteins, the, only, gene, commercially, used, to, provide, insect, protection, that, does, not, originate, from, b, thuringiensis, is, the, cowpea, trypsin, inhibitor, cpti, cpti, was, first, approved, for, use, cotton, in, 1999, and, is, currently, undergoing, trials, in, rice, less, than, one, percent, of, gm, crops, contained, other, traits, which, include, providing, virus, resistance, delaying, senescence, and, altering, the, plants, composition, golden, rice, is, the, most, well, known, gm, crop, that, is, aimed, at, increasing, nutrient, value, it, has, been, engineered, with, three, genes, that, biosynthesise, beta, carotene, a, precursor, of, vitamin, a, in, the, edible, parts, of, rice, it, is, intended, to, produce, a, fortified, food, to, be, grown, and, consumed, in, areas, with, a, shortage, of, dietary, vitamin, a, a, deficiency, which, each, year, is, estimated, to, kill, 670, 000, children, under, the, age, of, 5, and, cause, an, additional, 500, 000, cases, of, irreversible, childhood, blindness, the, original, golden, rice, produced, 1, 6, g, g, of, the, carotenoids, with, further, development, increasing, this, 23, times, it, gained, its, first, approvals, for, use, as, food, in, 2018, plants, and, plant, cells, have, been, genetically, engineered, for, production, of, biopharmaceuticals, in, bioreactors, a, process, known, as, pharming, work, has, been, done, with, duckweed, lemna, minor, the, algae, chlamydomonas, reinhardtii, and, the, moss, physcomitrella, patens, biopharmaceuticals, produced, include, cytokines, hormones, antibodies, enzymes, and, vaccines, most, of, which, are, accumulated, in, the, plant, seeds, many, drugs, also, contain, natural, plant, ingredients, and, the, pathways, that, lead, to, their, production, have, been, genetically, altered, or, transferred, to, other, plant, species, to, produce, greater, volume, other, options, for, bioreactors, are, biopolymers, and, biofuels, unlike, bacteria, plants, can, modify, the, proteins, post, translationally, allowing, them, to, make, more, complex, molecules, they, also, pose, less, risk, of, being, contaminated, therapeutics, have, been, cultured, in, transgenic, carrot, and, tobacco, cells, including, a, drug, treatment, for, gaucher, s, disease, vaccine, production, and, storage, has, great, potential, in, transgenic, plants, vaccines, are, expensive, to, produce, transport, and, administer, so, having, a, system, that, could, produce, them, locally, would, allow, greater, access, to, poorer, and, developing, areas, as, well, as, purifying, vaccines, expressed, in, plants, it, is, also, possible, to, produce, edible, vaccines, in, plants, edible, vaccines, stimulate, the, immune, system, when, ingested, to, protect, against, certain, diseases, being, stored, in, plants, reduces, the, long, term, cost, as, they, can, be, disseminated, without, the, need, for, cold, storage, don, t, need, to, be, purified, and, have, long, term, stability, also, being, housed, within, plant, cells, provides, some, protection, from, the, gut, acids, upon, digestion, however, the, cost, of, developing, regulating, and, containing, transgenic, plants, is, high, leading, to, most, current, plant, based, vaccine, development, being, applied, to, veterinary, medicine, where, the, controls, are, not, as, strict, genetically, modified, crops, have, been, proposed, as, one, of, the, ways, to, reduce, farming, related, co, 2, emissions, due, to, higher, yield, reduced, use, of, pesticides, reduced, use, of, tractor, fuel, and, no, tillage, according, to, a, 2021, study, in, eu, alone, widespread, adoption, of, ge, crops, would, reduce, greenhouse, gas, emissions, by, 33, million, tons, of, co, 2, equivalent, or, 7, 5, of, total, farming, related, emissions, the, vast, majority, of, genetically, modified, animals, are, at, the, research, stage, with, the, number, close, to, entering, the, market, remaining, small, as, of, 2018, only, three, genetically, modified, animals, have, been, approved, all, in, the, usa, a, goat, and, a, chicken, have, been, engineered, to, produce, medicines, and, a, salmon, has, increased, its, own, growth, despite, the, differences, and, difficulties, in, modifying, them, the, end, aims, are, much, the, same, as, for, plants, gm, animals, are, created, for, research, purposes, production, of, industrial, or, therapeutic, products, agricultural, uses, or, improving, their, health, there, is, also, a, market, for, creating, genetically, modified, pets, the, process, of, genetically, engineering, mammals, is, slow, tedious, and, expensive, however, new, technologies, are, making, genetic, modifications, easier, and, more, precise, the, first, transgenic, mammals, were, produced, by, injecting, viral, dna, into, embryos, and, then, implanting, the, embryos, in, females, the, embryo, would, develop, and, it, would, be, hoped, that, some, of, the, genetic, material, would, be, incorporated, into, the, reproductive, cells, then, researchers, would, have, to, wait, until, the, animal, reached, breeding, age, and, then, offspring, would, be, screened, for, the, presence, of, the, gene, in, every, cell, the, development, of, the, crispr, cas9, gene, editing, system, as, a, cheap, and, fast, way, of, directly, modifying, germ, cells, effectively, halving, the, amount, of, time, needed, to, develop, genetically, modified, mammals, mammals, are, the, best, models, for, human, disease, making, genetic, engineered, ones, vital, to, the, discovery, and, development, of, cures, and, treatments, for, many, serious, diseases, knocking, out, genes, responsible, for, human, genetic, disorders, allows, researchers, to, study, the, mechanism, of, the, disease, and, to, test, possible, cures, genetically, modified, mice, have, been, the, most, common, mammals, used, in, biomedical, research, as, they, are, cheap, and, easy, to, manipulate, pigs, are, also, a, good, target, as, they, have, a, similar, body, size, and, anatomical, features, physiology, pathophysiological, response, and, diet, nonhuman, primates, are, the, most, similar, model, organisms, to, humans, but, there, is, less, public, acceptance, towards, using, them, as, research, animals, in, 2009, scientists, announced, that, they, had, successfully, transferred, a, gene, into, a, primate, species, marmosets, for, the, first, time, their, first, research, target, for, these, marmosets, was, parkinson, s, disease, but, they, were, also, considering, amyotrophic, lateral, sclerosis, and, huntington, s, disease, human, proteins, expressed, in, mammals, are, more, likely, to, be, similar, to, their, natural, counterparts, than, those, expressed, in, plants, or, microorganisms, stable, expression, has, been, accomplished, in, sheep, pigs, rats, and, other, animals, in, 2009, the, first, human, biological, drug, produced, from, such, an, animal, a, goat, was, approved, the, drug, atryn, is, an, anticoagulant, which, reduces, the, probability, of, blood, clots, during, surgery, or, childbirth, and, is, extracted, from, the, goat, s, milk, human, alpha, 1, antitrypsin, is, another, protein, that, has, been, produced, from, goats, and, is, used, in, treating, humans, with, this, deficiency, another, medicinal, area, is, in, creating, pigs, with, greater, capacity, for, human, organ, transplants, xenotransplantation, pigs, have, been, genetically, modified, so, that, their, organs, can, no, longer, carry, retroviruses, or, have, modifications, to, reduce, the, chance, of, rejection, chimeric, pigs, could, carry, fully, human, organs, the, first, human, transplant, of, a, genetically, modified, pig, heart, occurred, in, 2023, and, kidney, in, 2024, livestock, are, modified, with, the, intention, of, improving, economically, important, traits, such, as, growth, rate, quality, of, meat, milk, composition, disease, resistance, and, survival, animals, have, been, engineered, to, grow, faster, be, healthier, and, resist, diseases, modifications, have, also, improved, the, wool, production, of, sheep, and, udder, health, of, cows, goats, have, been, genetically, engineered, to, produce, milk, with, strong, spiderweb, like, silk, proteins, in, their, milk, a, gm, pig, called, enviropig, was, created, with, the, capability, of, digesting, plant, phosphorus, more, efficiently, than, conventional, pigs, they, could, reduce, water, pollution, since, they, excrete, 30, to, 70, less, phosphorus, in, manure, dairy, cows, have, been, genetically, engineered, to, produce, milk, that, would, be, the, same, as, human, breast, milk, this, could, potentially, benefit, mothers, who, cannot, produce, breast, milk, but, want, their, children, to, have, breast, milk, rather, than, formula, researchers, have, also, developed, a, genetically, engineered, cow, that, produces, allergy, free, milk, scientists, have, genetically, engineered, several, organisms, including, some, mammals, to, include, green, fluorescent, protein, gfp, for, research, purposes, gfp, and, other, similar, reporting, genes, allow, easy, visualization, and, localization, of, the, products, of, the, genetic, modification, fluorescent, pigs, have, been, bred, to, study, human, organ, transplants, regenerating, ocular, photoreceptor, cells, and, other, topics, in, 2011, green, fluorescent, cats, were, created, to, help, find, therapies, for, hiv, aids, and, other, diseases, as, feline, immunodeficiency, virus, is, related, to, hiv, there, have, been, suggestions, that, genetic, engineering, could, be, used, to, bring, animals, back, from, extinction, it, involves, changing, the, genome, of, a, close, living, relative, to, resemble, the, extinct, one, and, is, currently, being, attempted, with, the, passenger, pigeon, genes, associated, with, the, woolly, mammoth, have, been, added, to, the, genome, of, an, african, elephant, although, the, lead, researcher, says, he, has, no, intention, of, creating, live, elephants, and, transferring, all, the, genes, and, reversing, years, of, genetic, evolution, is, a, long, way, from, being, feasible, it, is, more, likely, that, scientists, could, use, this, technology, to, conserve, endangered, animals, by, bringing, back, lost, diversity, or, transferring, evolved, genetic, advantages, from, adapted, organisms, to, those, that, are, struggling, gene, therapy, uses, genetically, modified, viruses, to, deliver, genes, which, can, cure, disease, in, humans, although, gene, therapy, is, still, relatively, new, it, has, had, some, successes, it, has, been, used, to, treat, genetic, disorders, such, as, severe, combined, immunodeficiency, and, leber, s, congenital, amaurosis, treatments, are, also, being, developed, for, a, range, of, other, currently, incurable, diseases, such, as, cystic, fibrosis, sickle, cell, anemia, parkinson, s, disease, cancer, diabetes, heart, disease, and, muscular, dystrophy, these, treatments, only, effect, somatic, cells, meaning, any, changes, would, not, be, inheritable, germline, gene, therapy, results, in, any, change, being, inheritable, which, has, raised, concerns, within, the, scientific, community, in, 2015, crispr, was, used, to, edit, the, dna, of, non, viable, human, embryos, in, november, 2018, he, jiankui, announced, that, he, had, edited, the, genomes, of, two, human, embryos, in, an, attempt, to, disable, the, ccr5, gene, which, codes, for, a, receptor, that, hiv, uses, to, enter, cells, he, said, that, twin, girls, lulu, and, nana, had, been, born, a, few, weeks, earlier, and, that, they, carried, functional, copies, of, ccr5, along, with, disabled, ccr5, mosaicism, and, were, still, vulnerable, to, hiv, the, work, was, widely, condemned, as, unethical, dangerous, and, premature, genetically, modified, fish, are, used, for, scientific, research, as, pets, and, as, a, food, source, aquaculture, is, a, growing, industry, currently, providing, over, half, the, consumed, fish, worldwide, through, genetic, engineering, it, is, possible, to, increase, growth, rates, reduce, food, intake, remove, allergenic, properties, increase, cold, tolerance, and, provide, disease, resistance, fish, can, also, be, used, to, detect, aquatic, pollution, or, function, as, bioreactors, several, groups, have, been, developing, zebrafish, to, detect, pollution, by, attaching, fluorescent, proteins, to, genes, activated, by, the, presence, of, pollutants, the, fish, will, then, glow, and, can, be, used, as, environmental, sensors, the, glofish, is, a, brand, of, genetically, modified, fluorescent, zebrafish, with, bright, red, green, and, orange, fluorescent, color, it, was, originally, developed, by, one, of, the, groups, to, detect, pollution, but, is, now, part, of, the, ornamental, fish, trade, becoming, the, first, genetically, modified, animal, to, become, publicly, available, as, a, pet, when, in, 2003, it, was, introduced, for, sale, in, the, usa, gm, fish, are, widely, used, in, basic, research, in, genetics, and, development, two, species, of, fish, zebrafish, and, medaka, are, most, commonly, modified, because, they, have, optically, clear, chorions, membranes, in, the, egg, rapidly, develop, and, the, one, cell, embryo, is, easy, to, see, and, microinject, with, transgenic, dna, zebrafish, are, model, organisms, for, developmental, processes, regeneration, genetics, behavior, disease, mechanisms, and, toxicity, testing, their, transparency, allows, researchers, to, observe, developmental, stages, intestinal, functions, and, tumour, growth, the, generation, of, transgenic, protocols, whole, organism, cell, or, tissue, specific, tagged, with, reporter, genes, has, increased, the, level, of, information, gained, by, studying, these, fish, gm, fish, have, been, developed, with, promoters, driving, an, over, production, of, growth, hormone, for, use, in, the, aquaculture, industry, to, increase, the, speed, of, development, and, potentially, reduce, fishing, pressure, on, wild, stocks, this, has, resulted, in, dramatic, growth, enhancement, in, several, species, including, salmon, trout, and, tilapia, aquabounty, technologies, a, biotechnology, company, have, produced, a, salmon, called, aquadvantage, salmon, that, can, mature, in, half, the, time, as, wild, salmon, it, obtained, regulatory, approval, in, 2015, the, first, non, plant, gmo, food, to, be, commercialized, as, of, august, 2017, gmo, salmon, is, being, sold, in, canada, sales, in, the, us, started, in, may, 2021, in, biological, research, transgenic, fruit, flies, drosophila, melanogaster, are, model, organisms, used, to, study, the, effects, of, genetic, changes, on, development, fruit, flies, are, often, preferred, over, other, animals, due, to, their, short, life, cycle, and, low, maintenance, requirements, they, also, have, a, relatively, simple, genome, compared, to, many, vertebrates, with, typically, only, one, copy, of, each, gene, making, phenotypic, analysis, easy, drosophila, have, been, used, to, study, genetics, and, inheritance, embryonic, development, learning, behavior, and, aging, the, discovery, of, transposons, in, particular, the, p, element, in, drosophila, provided, an, early, method, to, add, transgenes, to, their, genome, although, this, has, been, taken, over, by, more, modern, gene, editing, techniques, due, to, their, significance, to, human, health, scientists, are, looking, at, ways, to, control, mosquitoes, through, genetic, engineering, malaria, resistant, mosquitoes, have, been, developed, in, the, laboratory, by, inserting, a, gene, that, reduces, the, development, of, the, malaria, parasite, and, then, use, homing, endonucleases, to, rapidly, spread, that, gene, throughout, the, male, population, known, as, a, gene, drive, this, approach, has, been, taken, further, by, using, the, gene, drive, to, spread, a, lethal, gene, in, trials, the, populations, of, aedes, aegypti, mosquitoes, the, single, most, important, carrier, of, dengue, fever, and, zika, virus, were, reduced, by, between, 80, and, by, 90, another, approach, is, to, use, a, sterile, insect, technique, whereby, males, genetically, engineered, to, be, sterile, out, compete, viable, males, to, reduce, population, numbers, other, insect, pests, that, make, attractive, targets, are, moths, diamondback, moths, cause, us, 4, to, 5, billion, of, damage, each, year, worldwide, the, approach, is, similar, to, the, sterile, technique, tested, on, mosquitoes, where, males, are, transformed, with, a, gene, that, prevents, any, females, born, from, reaching, maturity, they, underwent, field, trials, in, 2017, genetically, modified, moths, have, previously, been, released, in, field, trials, in, this, case, a, strain, of, pink, bollworm, that, were, sterilized, with, radiation, were, genetically, engineered, to, express, a, red, fluorescent, protein, making, it, easier, for, researchers, to, monitor, them, silkworm, the, larvae, stage, of, bombyx, mori, is, an, economically, important, insect, in, sericulture, scientists, are, developing, strategies, to, enhance, silk, quality, and, quantity, there, is, also, potential, to, use, the, silk, producing, machinery, to, make, other, valuable, proteins, proteins, currently, developed, to, be, expressed, by, silkworms, include, human, serum, albumin, human, collagen, chain, mouse, monoclonal, antibody, and, n, glycanase, silkworms, have, been, created, that, produce, spider, silk, a, stronger, but, extremely, difficult, to, harvest, silk, and, even, novel, silks, systems, have, been, developed, to, create, transgenic, organisms, in, a, wide, variety, of, other, animals, chickens, have, been, genetically, modified, for, a, variety, of, purposes, this, includes, studying, embryo, development, preventing, the, transmission, of, bird, flu, and, providing, evolutionary, insights, using, reverse, engineering, to, recreate, dinosaur, like, phenotypes, a, gm, chicken, that, produces, the, drug, kanuma, an, enzyme, that, treats, a, rare, condition, in, its, egg, passed, us, regulatory, approval, in, 2015, genetically, modified, frogs, in, particular, xenopus, laevis, and, xenopus, tropicalis, are, used, in, developmental, biology, research, gm, frogs, can, also, be, used, as, pollution, sensors, especially, for, endocrine, disrupting, chemicals, there, are, proposals, to, use, genetic, engineering, to, control, cane, toads, in, australia, the, nematode, caenorhabditis, elegans, is, one, of, the, major, model, organisms, for, researching, molecular, biology, rna, interference, rnai, was, discovered, in, c, elegans, and, could, be, induced, by, simply, feeding, them, bacteria, modified, to, express, double, stranded, rna, it, is, also, relatively, easy, to, produce, stable, transgenic, nematodes, and, this, along, with, rnai, are, the, major, tools, used, in, studying, their, genes, the, most, common, use, of, transgenic, nematodes, has, been, studying, gene, expression, and, localization, by, attaching, reporter, genes, transgenes, can, also, be, combined, with, rnai, techniques, to, rescue, phenotypes, study, gene, function, image, cell, development, in, real, time, or, control, expression, for, different, tissues, or, developmental, stages, transgenic, nematodes, have, been, used, to, study, viruses, toxicology, diseases, and, to, detect, environmental, pollutants, the, gene, responsible, for, albinism, in, sea, cucumbers, has, been, found, and, used, to, engineer, white, sea, cucumbers, a, rare, delicacy, the, technology, also, opens, the, way, to, investigate, the, genes, responsible, for, some, of, the, cucumbers, more, unusual, traits, including, hibernating, in, summer, eviscerating, their, intestines, and, dissolving, their, bodies, upon, death, flatworms, have, the, ability, to, regenerate, themselves, from, a, single, cell, until, 2017, there, was, no, effective, way, to, transform, them, which, hampered, research, by, using, microinjection, and, radiation, scientists, have, now, created, the, first, genetically, modified, flatworms, the, bristle, worm, a, marine, annelid, has, been, modified, it, is, of, interest, due, to, its, reproductive, cycle, being, synchronized, with, lunar, phases, regeneration, capacity, and, slow, evolution, rate, cnidaria, such, as, hydra, and, the, sea, anemone, nematostella, vectensis, are, attractive, model, organisms, to, study, the, evolution, of, immunity, and, certain, developmental, processes, other, animals, that, have, been, genetically, modified, include, snails, geckos, turtles, crayfish, oysters, shrimp, clams, abalone, and, sponges, genetically, modified, organisms, are, regulated, by, government, agencies, this, applies, to, research, as, well, as, the, release, of, genetically, modified, organisms, including, crops, and, food, the, development, of, a, regulatory, framework, concerning, genetic, engineering, began, in, 1975, at, asilomar, california, the, asilomar, meeting, recommended, a, set, of, guidelines, regarding, the, cautious, use, of, recombinant, technology, and, any, products, resulting, from, that, technology, the, cartagena, protocol, on, biosafety, was, adopted, on, 29, january, 2000, and, entered, into, force, on, 11, september, 2003, it, is, an, international, treaty, that, governs, the, transfer, handling, and, use, of, genetically, modified, organisms, one, hundred, and, fifty, seven, countries, are, members, of, the, protocol, and, many, use, it, as, a, reference, point, for, their, own, regulations, universities, and, research, institutes, generally, have, a, special, committee, that, is, responsible, for, approving, any, experiments, that, involve, genetic, engineering, many, experiments, also, need, permission, from, a, national, regulatory, group, or, legislation, all, staff, must, be, trained, in, the, use, of, gmos, and, all, laboratories, must, gain, approval, from, their, regulatory, agency, to, work, with, gmos, the, legislation, covering, gmos, are, often, derived, from, regulations, and, guidelines, in, place, for, the, non, gmo, version, of, the, organism, although, they, are, more, severe, there, is, a, near, universal, system, for, assessing, the, relative, risks, associated, with, gmos, and, other, agents, to, laboratory, staff, and, the, community, they, are, assigned, to, one, of, four, risk, categories, based, on, their, virulence, the, severity, of, the, disease, the, mode, of, transmission, and, the, availability, of, preventive, measures, or, treatments, there, are, four, biosafety, levels, that, a, laboratory, can, fall, into, ranging, from, level, 1, which, is, suitable, for, working, with, agents, not, associated, with, disease, to, level, 4, working, with, life, threatening, agents, different, countries, use, different, nomenclature, to, describe, the, levels, and, can, have, different, requirements, for, what, can, be, done, at, each, level, there, are, differences, in, the, regulation, for, the, release, of, gmos, between, countries, with, some, of, the, most, marked, differences, occurring, between, the, us, and, europe, regulation, varies, in, a, given, country, depending, on, the, intended, use, of, the, products, of, the, genetic, engineering, for, example, a, crop, not, intended, for, food, use, is, generally, not, reviewed, by, authorities, responsible, for, food, safety, some, nations, have, banned, the, release, of, gmos, or, restricted, their, use, and, others, permit, them, with, widely, differing, degrees, of, regulation, in, 2016, thirty, eight, countries, officially, ban, or, prohibit, the, cultivation, of, gmos, and, nine, algeria, bhutan, kenya, kyrgyzstan, madagascar, peru, russia, venezuela, and, zimbabwe, ban, their, importation, most, countries, that, do, not, allow, gmo, cultivation, do, permit, research, using, gmos, despite, regulation, illegal, releases, have, sometimes, occurred, due, to, weakness, of, enforcement, the, european, union, eu, differentiates, between, approval, for, cultivation, within, the, eu, and, approval, for, import, and, processing, while, only, a, few, gmos, have, been, approved, for, cultivation, in, the, eu, a, number, of, gmos, have, been, approved, for, import, and, processing, the, cultivation, of, gmos, has, triggered, a, debate, about, the, market, for, gmos, in, europe, depending, on, the, coexistence, regulations, incentives, for, cultivation, of, gm, crops, differ, the, us, policy, does, not, focus, on, the, process, as, much, as, other, countries, looks, at, verifiable, scientific, risks, and, uses, the, concept, of, substantial, equivalence, whether, gene, edited, organisms, should, be, regulated, the, same, as, genetically, modified, organism, is, debated, usa, regulations, sees, them, as, separate, and, does, not, regulate, them, under, the, same, conditions, while, in, europe, a, gmo, is, any, organism, created, using, genetic, engineering, techniques, one, of, the, key, issues, concerning, regulators, is, whether, gm, products, should, be, labeled, the, european, commission, says, that, mandatory, labeling, and, traceability, are, needed, to, allow, for, informed, choice, avoid, potential, false, advertising, and, facilitate, the, withdrawal, of, products, if, adverse, effects, on, health, or, the, environment, are, discovered, the, american, medical, association, and, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, say, that, absent, scientific, evidence, of, harm, even, voluntary, labeling, is, misleading, and, will, falsely, alarm, consumers, labeling, of, gmo, products, in, the, marketplace, is, required, in, 64, countries, labeling, can, be, mandatory, up, to, a, threshold, gm, content, level, which, varies, between, countries, or, voluntary, in, the, u, s, the, national, bioengineered, food, disclosure, standard, mandatory, compliance, date, january, 1, 2022, requires, labeling, gm, foods, in, canada, labeling, of, gm, food, is, voluntary, while, in, europe, all, food, including, processed, food, or, feed, which, contains, greater, than, 0, 9, of, approved, gmos, must, be, labeled, in, 2014, sales, of, products, that, had, been, labeled, as, non, gmo, grew, 30, percent, to, 1, 1, billion, there, is, controversy, over, gmos, especially, with, regard, to, their, release, outside, laboratory, environments, the, dispute, involves, consumers, producers, biotechnology, companies, governmental, regulators, non, governmental, organizations, and, scientists, many, of, these, concerns, involve, gm, crops, and, whether, food, produced, from, them, is, safe, and, what, impact, growing, them, will, have, on, the, environment, these, controversies, have, led, to, litigation, international, trade, disputes, and, protests, and, to, restrictive, regulation, of, commercial, products, in, some, countries, most, concerns, are, around, the, health, and, environmental, effects, of, gmos, these, include, whether, they, may, provoke, an, allergic, reaction, whether, the, transgenes, could, transfer, to, human, cells, and, whether, genes, not, approved, for, human, consumption, could, outcross, into, the, food, supply, there, is, a, scientific, consensus, that, currently, available, food, derived, from, gm, crops, poses, no, greater, risk, to, human, health, than, conventional, food, but, that, each, gm, food, needs, to, be, tested, on, a, case, by, case, basis, before, introduction, nonetheless, members, of, the, public, are, much, less, likely, than, scientists, to, perceive, gm, foods, as, safe, the, legal, and, regulatory, status, of, gm, foods, varies, by, country, with, some, nations, banning, or, restricting, them, and, others, permitting, them, with, widely, differing, degrees, of, regulation, as, late, as, the, 1990s, gene, flow, into, wild, populations, was, thought, to, be, unlikely, and, rare, and, if, it, were, to, occur, easily, eradicated, it, was, thought, that, this, would, add, no, additional, environmental, costs, or, risks, no, effects, were, expected, other, than, those, already, caused, by, pesticide, applications, however, in, the, decades, since, several, such, examples, have, been, observed, gene, flow, between, gm, crops, and, compatible, plants, along, with, increased, use, of, broad, spectrum, herbicides, can, increase, the, risk, of, herbicide, resistant, weed, populations, debate, over, the, extent, and, consequences, of, gene, flow, intensified, in, 2001, when, a, paper, was, published, showing, transgenes, had, been, found, in, landrace, maize, in, mexico, the, crop, s, center, of, diversity, gene, flow, from, gm, crops, to, other, organisms, has, been, found, to, generally, be, lower, than, what, would, occur, naturally, in, order, to, address, some, of, these, concerns, some, gmos, have, been, developed, with, traits, to, help, control, their, spread, to, prevent, the, genetically, modified, salmon, inadvertently, breeding, with, wild, salmon, all, the, fish, raised, for, food, are, females, triploid, 99, are, reproductively, sterile, and, raised, in, areas, where, escaped, salmon, could, not, survive, bacteria, have, also, been, modified, to, depend, on, nutrients, that, cannot, be, found, in, nature, and, genetic, use, restriction, technology, has, been, developed, though, not, yet, marketed, that, causes, the, second, generation, of, gm, plants, to, be, sterile, other, environmental, and, agronomic, concerns, include, a, decrease, in, biodiversity, an, increase, in, secondary, pests, non, targeted, pests, and, evolution, of, resistant, insect, pests, in, the, areas, of, china, and, the, us, with, bt, crops, the, overall, biodiversity, of, insects, has, increased, and, the, impact, of, secondary, pests, has, been, minimal, resistance, was, found, to, be, slow, to, evolve, when, best, practice, strategies, were, followed, the, impact, of, bt, crops, on, beneficial, non, target, organisms, became, a, public, issue, after, a, 1999, paper, suggested, they, could, be, toxic, to, monarch, butterflies, follow, up, studies, have, since, shown, that, the, toxicity, levels, encountered, in, the, field, were, not, high, enough, to, harm, the, larvae, accusations, that, scientists, are, playing, god, and, other, religious, issues, have, been, ascribed, to, the, technology, from, the, beginning, with, the, ability, to, genetically, engineer, humans, now, possible, there, are, ethical, concerns, over, how, far, this, technology, should, go, or, if, it, should, be, used, at, all, much, debate, revolves, around, where, the, line, between, treatment, and, enhancement, is, and, whether, the, modifications, should, be, inheritable, other, concerns, include, contamination, of, the, non, genetically, modified, food, supply, the, rigor, of, the, regulatory, process, consolidation, of, control, of, the, food, supply, in, companies, that, make, and, sell, gmos, exaggeration, of, the, benefits, of, genetic, modification, or, concerns, over, the, use, of, herbicides, with, glyphosate, other, issues, raised, include, the, patenting, of, life, and, the, use, of, intellectual, property, rights, there, are, large, differences, in, consumer, acceptance, of, gmos, with, europeans, more, likely, to, view, gm, food, negatively, than, north, americans, gmos, arrived, on, the, scene, as, the, public, confidence, in, food, safety, attributed, to, recent, food, scares, such, as, bovine, spongiform, encephalopathy, and, other, scandals, involving, government, regulation, of, products, in, europe, was, low, this, along, with, campaigns, run, by, various, non, governmental, organizations, ngo, have, been, very, successful, in, blocking, or, limiting, the, use, of, gm, crops, ngos, like, the, organic, consumers, association, the, union, of, concerned, scientists, greenpeace, and, other, groups, have, said, that, risks, have, not, been, adequately, identified, and, managed, and, that, there, are, unanswered, questions, regarding, the, potential, long, term, impact, on, human, health, from, food, derived, from, gmos, they, propose, mandatory, labeling, or, a, moratorium, on, such, products, and, contrast
