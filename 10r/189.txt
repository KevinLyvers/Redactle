an, oil, refinery, or, petroleum, refinery, is, an, industrial, process, plant, where, petroleum, crude, oil, is, transformed, and, refined, into, products, such, as, gasoline, petrol, diesel, fuel, asphalt, base, fuel, oils, heating, oil, kerosene, liquefied, petroleum, gas, and, petroleum, naphtha, petrochemical, feedstock, like, ethylene, and, propylene, can, also, be, produced, directly, by, cracking, crude, oil, without, the, need, of, using, refined, products, of, crude, oil, such, as, naphtha, the, crude, oil, feedstock, has, typically, been, processed, by, an, oil, production, plant, there, is, usually, an, oil, depot, at, or, near, an, oil, refinery, for, the, storage, of, incoming, crude, oil, feedstock, as, well, as, bulk, liquid, products, in, 2020, the, total, capacity, of, global, refineries, for, crude, oil, was, about, 101, 2, million, barrels, per, day, oil, refineries, are, typically, large, sprawling, industrial, complexes, with, extensive, piping, running, throughout, carrying, streams, of, fluids, between, large, chemical, processing, units, such, as, distillation, columns, in, many, ways, oil, refineries, use, many, different, technologies, and, can, be, thought, of, as, types, of, chemical, plants, since, december, 2008, the, world, s, largest, oil, refinery, has, been, the, jamnagar, refinery, owned, by, reliance, industries, located, in, gujarat, india, with, a, processing, capacity, of, 1, 24, million, barrels, 197, 000, m, 3, per, day, oil, refineries, are, an, essential, part, of, the, petroleum, industry, s, downstream, sector, the, chinese, were, among, the, first, civilizations, to, refine, oil, as, early, as, the, first, century, the, chinese, were, refining, crude, oil, for, use, as, an, energy, source, between, 512, and, 518, in, the, late, northern, wei, dynasty, the, chinese, geographer, writer, and, politician, li, daoyuan, introduced, the, process, of, refining, oil, into, various, lubricants, in, his, famous, work, commentary, on, the, water, classic, crude, oil, was, often, distilled, by, persian, chemists, with, clear, descriptions, given, in, handbooks, such, as, those, of, muhammad, ibn, zakar, ya, r, zi, c, 865, 925, the, streets, of, baghdad, were, paved, with, tar, derived, from, petroleum, that, became, accessible, from, natural, fields, in, the, region, in, the, 9th, century, oil, fields, were, exploited, in, the, area, around, modern, baku, azerbaijan, these, fields, were, described, by, the, arab, geographer, abu, al, hasan, al, al, mas, d, in, the, 10th, century, and, by, marco, polo, in, the, 13th, century, who, described, the, output, of, those, wells, as, hundreds, of, shiploads, arab, and, persian, chemists, also, distilled, crude, oil, in, order, to, produce, flammable, products, for, military, purposes, through, islamic, spain, distillation, became, available, in, western, europe, by, the, 12th, century, in, the, northern, song, dynasty, 960, 1127, a, workshop, called, the, fierce, oil, workshop, was, established, in, the, city, of, kaifeng, to, produce, refined, oil, for, the, song, military, as, a, weapon, the, troops, would, then, fill, iron, cans, with, refined, oil, and, throw, them, toward, the, enemy, troops, causing, a, fire, effectively, the, world, s, first, fire, bomb, the, workshop, was, one, of, the, world, s, earliest, oil, refining, factories, where, thousands, of, people, worked, to, produce, chinese, oil, powered, weaponry, prior, to, the, nineteenth, century, petroleum, was, known, and, utilized, in, various, fashions, in, babylon, egypt, china, philippines, rome, and, azerbaijan, however, the, modern, history, of, the, petroleum, industry, is, said, to, have, begun, in, 1846, when, abraham, gessner, of, nova, scotia, canada, devised, a, process, to, produce, kerosene, from, coal, shortly, thereafter, in, 1854, ignacy, ukasiewicz, began, producing, kerosene, from, hand, dug, oil, wells, near, the, town, of, krosno, poland, romania, was, registered, as, the, first, country, in, world, oil, production, statistics, according, to, the, academy, of, world, records, in, north, america, the, first, oil, well, was, drilled, in, 1858, by, james, miller, williams, in, oil, springs, ontario, canada, in, the, united, states, the, petroleum, industry, began, in, 1859, when, edwin, drake, found, oil, near, titusville, pennsylvania, the, industry, grew, slowly, in, the, 1800s, primarily, producing, kerosene, for, oil, lamps, in, the, early, twentieth, century, the, introduction, of, the, internal, combustion, engine, and, its, use, in, automobiles, created, a, market, for, gasoline, that, was, the, impetus, for, fairly, rapid, growth, of, the, petroleum, industry, the, early, finds, of, petroleum, like, those, in, ontario, and, pennsylvania, were, soon, outstripped, by, large, oil, booms, in, oklahoma, texas, and, california, samuel, kier, established, america, s, first, oil, refinery, in, pittsburgh, on, seventh, avenue, near, grant, street, in, 1853, polish, pharmacist, and, inventor, ignacy, ukasiewicz, established, an, oil, refinery, in, jas, o, then, part, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, now, in, poland, in, 1854, the, first, large, refinery, opened, at, ploie, ti, romania, in, 1856, 1857, it, was, in, ploiesti, that, 51, years, later, in, 1908, laz, r, edeleanu, a, romanian, chemist, of, jewish, origin, who, got, his, ph, d, in, 1887, by, discovering, the, amphetamine, invented, patented, and, tested, on, industrial, scale, the, first, modern, method, of, liquid, extraction, for, refining, crude, oil, the, edeleanu, process, this, increased, the, refining, efficiency, compared, to, pure, fractional, distillation, and, allowed, a, massive, development, of, the, refining, plants, successively, the, process, was, implemented, in, france, germany, u, s, and, in, a, few, decades, became, worldwide, spread, in, 1910, edeleanu, founded, allgemeine, gesellschaft, f, r, chemische, industrie, in, germany, which, given, the, success, of, the, name, changed, to, edeleanu, gmbh, in, 1930, during, nazi, s, time, the, company, was, bought, by, the, deutsche, erd, l, ag, and, edeleanu, being, of, jewish, origin, moved, back, to, romania, after, the, war, the, trademark, was, used, by, the, successor, company, edeleanu, gesellschaft, mbh, alzenau, rwe, for, many, petroleum, products, while, the, company, was, lately, integrated, as, edl, in, the, p, rner, group, the, ploie, ti, refineries, after, being, taken, over, by, nazi, germany, were, bombed, in, the, 1943, operation, tidal, wave, by, the, allies, during, the, oil, campaign, of, world, war, ii, another, close, contender, for, the, title, of, hosting, the, world, s, oldest, oil, refinery, is, salzbergen, in, lower, saxony, germany, salzbergen, s, refinery, was, opened, in, 1860, at, one, point, the, refinery, in, ras, tanura, saudi, arabia, owned, by, saudi, aramco, was, claimed, to, be, the, largest, oil, refinery, in, the, world, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, the, largest, refinery, was, the, abadan, refinery, in, iran, this, refinery, suffered, extensive, damage, during, the, iran, iraq, war, since, 25, december, 2008, the, world, s, largest, refinery, complex, is, the, jamnagar, refinery, complex, consisting, of, two, refineries, side, by, side, operated, by, reliance, industries, limited, in, jamnagar, india, with, a, combined, production, capacity, of, 1, 240, 000, barrels, per, day, 197, 000, m, 3, d, pdvsa, s, paraguan, refinery, complex, in, paraguan, peninsula, venezuela, with, a, capacity, of, 940, 000, bbl, d, 149, 000, m, 3, d, and, sk, energy, s, ulsan, in, south, korea, with, 840, 000, bbl, d, 134, 000, m, 3, d, are, the, second, and, third, largest, respectively, prior, to, world, war, ii, in, the, early, 1940s, most, petroleum, refineries, in, the, united, states, consisted, simply, of, crude, oil, distillation, units, often, referred, to, as, atmospheric, crude, oil, distillation, units, some, refineries, also, had, vacuum, distillation, units, as, well, as, thermal, cracking, units, such, as, visbreakers, viscosity, breakers, units, to, lower, the, viscosity, of, the, oil, all, of, the, many, other, refining, processes, discussed, below, were, developed, during, the, war, or, within, a, few, years, after, the, war, they, became, commercially, available, within, 5, to, 10, years, after, the, war, ended, and, the, worldwide, petroleum, industry, experienced, very, rapid, growth, the, driving, force, for, that, growth, in, technology, and, in, the, number, and, size, of, refineries, worldwide, was, the, growing, demand, for, automotive, gasoline, and, aircraft, fuel, in, the, united, states, for, various, complex, economic, and, political, reasons, the, construction, of, new, refineries, came, to, a, virtual, stop, in, about, the, 1980s, however, many, of, the, existing, refineries, in, the, united, states, have, revamped, many, of, their, units, and, or, constructed, add, on, units, in, order, to, increase, their, crude, oil, processing, capacity, increase, the, octane, rating, of, their, product, gasoline, lower, the, sulfur, content, of, their, diesel, fuel, and, home, heating, fuels, to, comply, with, environmental, regulations, and, comply, with, environmental, air, pollution, and, water, pollution, requirements, in, the, 19th, century, refineries, in, the, u, s, processed, crude, oil, primarily, to, recover, the, kerosene, there, was, no, market, for, the, more, volatile, fraction, including, gasoline, which, was, considered, waste, and, was, often, dumped, directly, into, the, nearest, river, the, invention, of, the, automobile, shifted, the, demand, to, gasoline, and, diesel, which, remain, the, primary, refined, products, today, today, national, and, state, legislation, require, refineries, to, meet, stringent, air, and, water, cleanliness, standards, in, fact, oil, companies, in, the, u, s, perceive, obtaining, a, permit, to, build, a, modern, refinery, to, be, so, difficult, and, costly, that, no, new, refineries, were, built, though, many, have, been, expanded, in, the, u, s, from, 1976, until, 2014, when, the, small, dakota, prairie, refinery, in, north, dakota, began, operation, more, than, half, the, refineries, that, existed, in, 1981, are, now, closed, due, to, low, utilization, rates, and, accelerating, mergers, as, a, result, of, these, closures, total, us, refinery, capacity, fell, between, 1981, and, 1995, though, the, operating, capacity, stayed, fairly, constant, in, that, time, period, at, around, 15, 000, 000, barrels, per, day, 2, 400, 000, m, 3, d, increases, in, facility, size, and, improvements, in, efficiencies, have, offset, much, of, the, lost, physical, capacity, of, the, industry, in, 1982, the, earliest, data, provided, the, united, states, operated, 301, refineries, with, a, combined, capacity, of, 17, 9, million, barrels, 2, 850, 000, m, 3, of, crude, oil, each, calendar, day, in, 2010, there, were, 149, operable, u, s, refineries, with, a, combined, capacity, of, 17, 6, million, barrels, 2, 800, 000, m, 3, per, calendar, day, by, 2014, the, number, of, refinery, had, reduced, to, 140, but, the, total, capacity, increased, to, 18, 02, million, barrels, 2, 865, 000, m, 3, per, calendar, day, indeed, in, order, to, reduce, operating, costs, and, depreciation, refining, is, operated, in, fewer, sites, but, of, bigger, capacity, in, 2009, through, 2010, as, revenue, streams, in, the, oil, business, dried, up, and, profitability, of, oil, refineries, fell, due, to, lower, demand, for, product, and, high, reserves, of, supply, preceding, the, economic, recession, oil, companies, began, to, close, or, sell, the, less, profitable, refineries, raw, or, unprocessed, crude, oil, is, not, generally, useful, in, industrial, applications, although, light, sweet, low, viscosity, low, sulfur, crude, oil, has, been, used, directly, as, a, burner, fuel, to, produce, steam, for, the, propulsion, of, seagoing, vessels, the, lighter, elements, however, form, explosive, vapors, in, the, fuel, tanks, and, are, therefore, hazardous, especially, in, warships, instead, the, hundreds, of, different, hydrocarbon, molecules, in, crude, oil, are, separated, in, a, refinery, into, components, that, can, be, used, as, fuels, lubricants, and, feedstocks, in, petrochemical, processes, that, manufacture, such, products, as, plastics, detergents, solvents, elastomers, and, fibers, such, as, nylon, and, polyesters, petroleum, fossil, fuels, are, burned, in, internal, combustion, engines, to, provide, power, for, ships, automobiles, aircraft, engines, lawn, mowers, dirt, bikes, and, other, machines, different, boiling, points, allow, the, hydrocarbons, to, be, separated, by, distillation, since, the, lighter, liquid, products, are, in, great, demand, for, use, in, internal, combustion, engines, a, modern, refinery, will, convert, heavy, hydrocarbons, and, lighter, gaseous, elements, into, these, higher, value, products, oil, can, be, used, in, a, variety, of, ways, because, it, contains, hydrocarbons, of, varying, molecular, masses, forms, and, lengths, such, as, paraffins, aromatics, naphthenes, or, cycloalkanes, alkenes, dienes, and, alkynes, while, the, molecules, in, crude, oil, include, different, atoms, such, as, sulfur, and, nitrogen, the, hydrocarbons, are, the, most, common, form, of, molecules, which, are, molecules, of, varying, lengths, and, complexity, made, of, hydrogen, and, carbon, atoms, and, a, small, number, of, oxygen, atoms, the, differences, in, the, structure, of, these, molecules, account, for, their, varying, physical, and, chemical, properties, and, it, is, this, variety, that, makes, crude, oil, useful, in, a, broad, range, of, several, applications, once, separated, and, purified, of, any, contaminants, and, impurities, the, fuel, or, lubricant, can, be, sold, without, further, processing, smaller, molecules, such, as, isobutane, and, propylene, or, butylenes, can, be, recombined, to, meet, specific, octane, requirements, by, processes, such, as, alkylation, or, more, commonly, dimerization, the, octane, grade, of, gasoline, can, also, be, improved, by, catalytic, reforming, which, involves, removing, hydrogen, from, hydrocarbons, producing, compounds, with, higher, octane, ratings, such, as, aromatics, intermediate, products, such, as, gasoils, can, even, be, reprocessed, to, break, a, heavy, long, chained, oil, into, a, lighter, short, chained, one, by, various, forms, of, cracking, such, as, fluid, catalytic, cracking, thermal, cracking, and, hydrocracking, the, final, step, in, gasoline, production, is, the, blending, of, fuels, with, different, octane, ratings, vapor, pressures, and, other, properties, to, meet, product, specifications, another, method, for, reprocessing, and, upgrading, these, intermediate, products, residual, oils, uses, a, devolatilization, process, to, separate, usable, oil, from, the, waste, asphaltene, material, oil, refineries, are, large, scale, plants, processing, about, a, hundred, thousand, to, several, hundred, thousand, barrels, of, crude, oil, a, day, because, of, the, high, capacity, many, of, the, units, operate, continuously, as, opposed, to, processing, in, batches, at, steady, state, or, nearly, steady, state, for, months, to, years, the, high, capacity, also, makes, process, optimization, and, advanced, process, control, very, desirable, petroleum, products, are, materials, derived, from, crude, oil, petroleum, as, it, is, processed, in, oil, refineries, the, majority, of, petroleum, is, converted, to, petroleum, products, which, includes, several, classes, of, fuels, oil, refineries, also, produce, various, intermediate, products, such, as, hydrogen, light, hydrocarbons, reformate, and, pyrolysis, gasoline, these, are, not, usually, transported, but, instead, are, blended, or, processed, further, on, site, chemical, plants, are, thus, often, adjacent, to, oil, refineries, or, a, number, of, further, chemical, processes, are, integrated, into, it, for, example, light, hydrocarbons, are, steam, cracked, in, an, ethylene, plant, and, the, produced, ethylene, is, polymerized, to, produce, polyethene, to, ensure, both, proper, separation, and, environmental, protection, a, very, low, sulfur, content, is, necessary, in, all, but, the, heaviest, products, the, crude, sulfur, contaminant, is, transformed, to, hydrogen, sulfide, via, catalytic, hydrodesulfurization, and, removed, from, the, product, stream, via, amine, gas, treating, using, the, claus, process, hydrogen, sulfide, is, afterward, transformed, to, elementary, sulfur, to, be, sold, to, the, chemical, industry, the, rather, large, heat, energy, freed, by, this, process, is, directly, used, in, the, other, parts, of, the, refinery, often, an, electrical, power, plant, is, combined, into, the, whole, refinery, process, to, take, up, the, excess, heat, according, to, the, composition, of, the, crude, oil, and, depending, on, the, demands, of, the, market, refineries, can, produce, different, shares, of, petroleum, products, the, largest, share, of, oil, products, is, used, as, energy, carriers, i, e, various, grades, of, fuel, oil, and, gasoline, these, fuels, include, or, can, be, blended, to, give, gasoline, jet, fuel, diesel, fuel, heating, oil, and, heavier, fuel, oils, heavier, less, volatile, fractions, can, also, be, used, to, produce, asphalt, tar, paraffin, wax, lubricating, and, other, heavy, oils, refineries, also, produce, other, chemicals, some, of, which, are, used, in, chemical, processes, to, produce, plastics, and, other, useful, materials, since, petroleum, often, contains, a, few, percent, sulfur, containing, molecules, elemental, sulfur, is, also, often, produced, as, a, petroleum, product, carbon, in, the, form, of, petroleum, coke, and, hydrogen, may, also, be, produced, as, petroleum, products, the, hydrogen, produced, is, often, used, as, an, intermediate, product, for, other, oil, refinery, processes, such, as, hydrocracking, and, hydrodesulfurization, petroleum, products, are, usually, grouped, into, four, categories, light, distillates, lpg, gasoline, naphtha, middle, distillates, kerosene, jet, fuel, diesel, heavy, distillates, and, residuum, heavy, fuel, oil, lubricating, oils, wax, asphalt, these, require, blending, various, feedstocks, mixing, appropriate, additives, providing, short, term, storage, and, preparation, for, bulk, loading, to, trucks, barges, product, ships, and, railcars, this, classification, is, based, on, the, way, crude, oil, is, distilled, and, separated, into, fractions, over, 6, 000, items, are, made, from, petroleum, waste, by, products, including, fertilizer, floor, coverings, perfume, insecticide, petroleum, jelly, soap, vitamin, capsules, the, image, below, is, a, schematic, flow, diagram, of, a, typical, oil, refinery, that, depicts, the, various, unit, processes, and, the, flow, of, intermediate, product, streams, that, occurs, between, the, inlet, crude, oil, feedstock, and, the, final, end, products, the, diagram, depicts, only, one, of, the, literally, hundreds, of, different, oil, refinery, configurations, the, diagram, also, does, not, include, any, of, the, usual, refinery, facilities, providing, utilities, such, as, steam, cooling, water, and, electric, power, as, well, as, storage, tanks, for, crude, oil, feedstock, and, for, intermediate, products, and, end, products, there, are, many, process, configurations, other, than, that, depicted, above, for, example, the, vacuum, distillation, unit, may, also, produce, fractions, that, can, be, refined, into, end, products, such, as, spindle, oil, used, in, the, textile, industry, light, machine, oil, motor, oil, and, various, waxes, the, crude, oil, distillation, unit, cdu, is, the, first, processing, unit, in, virtually, all, petroleum, refineries, the, cdu, distills, the, incoming, crude, oil, into, various, fractions, of, different, boiling, ranges, each, of, which, is, then, processed, further, in, the, other, refinery, processing, units, the, cdu, is, often, referred, to, as, the, atmospheric, distillation, unit, because, it, operates, at, slightly, above, atmospheric, pressure, below, is, a, schematic, flow, diagram, of, a, typical, crude, oil, distillation, unit, the, incoming, crude, oil, is, preheated, by, exchanging, heat, with, some, of, the, hot, distilled, fractions, and, other, streams, it, is, then, desalted, to, remove, inorganic, salts, primarily, sodium, chloride, following, the, desalter, the, crude, oil, is, further, heated, by, exchanging, heat, with, some, of, the, hot, distilled, fractions, and, other, streams, it, is, then, heated, in, a, fuel, fired, furnace, fired, heater, to, a, temperature, of, about, 398, c, and, routed, into, the, bottom, of, the, distillation, unit, the, cooling, and, condensing, of, the, distillation, tower, overhead, is, provided, partially, by, exchanging, heat, with, the, incoming, crude, oil, and, partially, by, either, an, air, cooled, or, water, cooled, condenser, additional, heat, is, removed, from, the, distillation, column, by, a, pumparound, system, as, shown, in, the, diagram, below, as, shown, in, the, flow, diagram, the, overhead, distillate, fraction, from, the, distillation, column, is, naphtha, the, fractions, removed, from, the, side, of, the, distillation, column, at, various, points, between, the, column, top, and, bottom, are, called, sidecuts, each, of, the, sidecuts, i, e, the, kerosene, light, gas, oil, and, heavy, gas, oil, is, cooled, by, exchanging, heat, with, the, incoming, crude, oil, all, of, the, fractions, i, e, the, overhead, naphtha, the, sidecuts, and, the, bottom, residue, are, sent, to, intermediate, storage, tanks, before, being, processed, further, a, party, searching, for, a, site, to, construct, a, refinery, or, a, chemical, plant, needs, to, consider, the, following, issues, factors, affecting, site, selection, for, oil, refinery, refineries, that, use, a, large, amount, of, steam, and, cooling, water, need, to, have, an, abundant, source, of, water, oil, refineries, therefore, are, often, located, nearby, navigable, rivers, or, on, a, seashore, nearby, a, port, such, location, also, gives, access, to, transportation, by, river, or, by, sea, the, advantages, of, transporting, crude, oil, by, pipeline, are, evident, and, oil, companies, often, transport, a, large, volume, of, fuel, to, distribution, terminals, by, pipeline, a, pipeline, may, not, be, practical, for, products, with, small, output, and, railcars, road, tankers, and, barges, are, used, petrochemical, plants, and, solvent, manufacturing, fine, fractionating, plants, need, spaces, for, further, processing, of, a, large, volume, of, refinery, products, or, to, mix, chemical, additives, with, a, product, at, source, rather, than, at, blending, terminals, the, refining, process, releases, a, number, of, different, chemicals, into, the, atmosphere, see, ap, 42, compilation, of, air, pollutant, emission, factors, and, a, notable, odor, normally, accompanies, the, presence, of, a, refinery, aside, from, air, pollution, impacts, there, are, also, wastewater, concerns, risks, of, industrial, accidents, such, as, fire, and, explosion, and, noise, health, effects, due, to, industrial, noise, many, governments, worldwide, have, mandated, restrictions, on, contaminants, that, refineries, release, and, most, refineries, have, installed, the, equipment, needed, to, comply, with, the, requirements, of, the, pertinent, environmental, protection, regulatory, agencies, in, the, united, states, there, is, strong, pressure, to, prevent, the, development, of, new, refineries, and, no, major, refinery, has, been, built, in, the, country, since, marathon, s, garyville, louisiana, facility, in, 1976, however, many, existing, refineries, have, been, expanded, during, that, time, environmental, restrictions, and, pressure, to, prevent, the, construction, of, new, refineries, may, have, also, contributed, to, rising, fuel, prices, in, the, united, states, additionally, many, refineries, more, than, 100, since, the, 1980s, have, closed, due, to, obsolescence, and, or, merger, activity, within, the, industry, itself, environmental, and, safety, concerns, mean, that, oil, refineries, are, sometimes, located, some, distance, away, from, major, urban, areas, nevertheless, there, are, many, instances, where, refinery, operations, are, close, to, populated, areas, and, pose, health, risks, in, california, s, contra, costa, county, and, solano, county, a, shoreline, necklace, of, refineries, built, in, the, early, 20th, century, before, this, area, was, populated, and, associated, chemical, plants, are, adjacent, to, urban, areas, in, richmond, martinez, pacheco, concord, pittsburg, vallejo, and, benicia, with, occasional, accidental, events, that, require, shelter, in, place, orders, to, the, adjacent, populations, a, number, of, refineries, are, located, in, sherwood, park, alberta, directly, adjacent, to, the, city, of, edmonton, which, has, a, population, of, over, 1, 000, 000, residents, niosh, criteria, for, occupational, exposure, to, refined, petroleum, solvents, have, been, available, since, 1977, modern, petroleum, refining, involves, a, complicated, system, of, interrelated, chemical, reactions, that, produce, a, wide, variety, of, petroleum, based, products, many, of, these, reactions, require, precise, temperature, and, pressure, parameters, the, equipment, and, monitoring, required, to, ensure, the, proper, progression, of, these, processes, is, complex, and, has, evolved, through, the, advancement, of, the, scientific, field, of, petroleum, engineering, the, wide, array, of, high, pressure, and, or, high, temperature, reactions, along, with, the, necessary, chemical, additives, or, extracted, contaminants, produces, an, astonishing, number, of, potential, health, hazards, to, the, oil, refinery, worker, through, the, advancement, of, technical, chemical, and, petroleum, engineering, the, vast, majority, of, these, processes, are, automated, and, enclosed, thus, greatly, reducing, the, potential, health, impact, to, workers, however, depending, on, the, specific, process, in, which, a, worker, is, engaged, as, well, as, the, particular, method, employed, by, the, refinery, in, which, he, she, works, significant, health, hazards, remain, although, occupational, injuries, in, the, united, states, were, not, routinely, tracked, and, reported, at, the, time, reports, of, the, health, impacts, of, working, in, an, oil, refinery, can, be, found, as, early, as, the, 1800s, for, instance, an, explosion, in, a, chicago, refinery, killed, 20, workers, in, 1890, since, then, numerous, fires, explosions, and, other, significant, events, have, from, time, to, time, drawn, the, public, s, attention, to, the, health, of, oil, refinery, workers, such, events, continue, in, the, 21st, century, with, explosions, reported, in, refineries, in, wisconsin, and, germany, in, 2018, however, there, are, many, less, visible, hazards, that, endanger, oil, refinery, workers, given, the, highly, automated, and, technically, advanced, nature, of, modern, petroleum, refineries, nearly, all, processes, are, contained, within, engineering, controls, and, represent, a, substantially, decreased, risk, of, exposure, to, workers, compared, to, earlier, times, however, certain, situations, or, work, tasks, may, subvert, these, safety, mechanisms, and, expose, workers, to, a, number, of, chemical, see, table, above, or, physical, described, below, hazards, examples, of, these, scenarios, include, a, 2021, systematic, review, associated, working, in, the, petrochemical, industry, with, increased, risk, of, various, cancers, such, as, mesothelioma, it, also, found, reduced, risks, of, other, cancers, such, as, stomach, and, rectal, the, systematic, review, did, mention, that, several, of, the, associations, were, not, due, to, factors, directly, related, to, the, petroleum, industry, rather, were, related, to, lifestyle, factors, such, as, smoking, evidence, for, adverse, health, effects, for, nearby, residents, was, also, weak, with, the, evidence, primarily, centering, around, neighborhoods, in, developed, countries, btx, stands, for, benzene, toluene, xylene, this, is, a, group, of, common, volatile, organic, compounds, vocs, that, are, found, in, the, oil, refinery, environment, and, serve, as, a, paradigm, for, more, in, depth, discussion, of, occupational, exposure, limits, chemical, exposure, and, surveillance, among, refinery, workers, the, most, important, route, of, exposure, for, btx, chemicals, is, inhalation, due, to, the, low, boiling, point, of, these, chemicals, the, majority, of, the, gaseous, production, of, btx, occurs, during, tank, cleaning, and, fuel, transfer, which, causes, offgassing, of, these, chemicals, into, the, air, exposure, can, also, occur, through, ingestion, via, contaminated, water, but, this, is, unlikely, in, an, occupational, setting, dermal, exposure, and, absorption, is, also, possible, but, is, again, less, likely, in, an, occupational, setting, where, appropriate, personal, protective, equipment, is, in, place, in, the, united, states, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, and, american, conference, of, governmental, industrial, hygienists, acgih, have, all, established, occupational, exposure, limits, oels, for, many, of, the, chemicals, above, that, workers, may, be, exposed, to, in, petroleum, refineries, benzene, in, particular, has, multiple, biomarkers, that, can, be, measured, to, determine, exposure, benzene, itself, can, be, measured, in, the, breath, blood, and, urine, and, metabolites, such, as, phenol, t, t, muconic, acid, t, t, ma, and, s, phenylmercapturic, acid, s, pma, can, be, measured, in, urine, in, addition, to, monitoring, the, exposure, levels, via, these, biomarkers, employers, are, required, by, osha, to, perform, regular, blood, tests, on, workers, to, test, for, early, signs, of, some, of, the, feared, hematologic, outcomes, of, which, the, most, widely, recognized, is, leukemia, required, testing, includes, complete, blood, count, with, cell, differentials, and, peripheral, blood, smear, on, a, regular, basis, the, utility, of, these, tests, is, supported, by, formal, scientific, studies, workers, are, at, risk, of, physical, injuries, due, to, a, large, number, of, high, powered, machines, in, the, relatively, close, proximity, of, the, oil, refinery, the, high, pressure, required, for, many, of, the, chemical, reactions, also, presents, the, possibility, of, localized, system, failures, resulting, in, blunt, or, penetrating, trauma, from, exploding, system, components, heat, is, also, a, hazard, the, temperature, required, for, the, proper, progression, of, certain, reactions, in, the, refining, process, can, reach, 1, 600, f, 870, c, as, with, chemicals, the, operating, system, is, designed, to, safely, contain, this, hazard, without, injury, to, the, worker, however, in, system, failures, this, is, a, potent, threat, to, workers, health, concerns, include, both, direct, injury, through, a, heat, illness, or, injury, as, well, as, the, potential, for, devastating, burns, should, the, worker, come, in, contact, with, super, heated, reagents, equipment, noise, is, another, hazard, refineries, can, be, very, loud, environments, and, have, previously, been, shown, to, be, associated, with, hearing, loss, among, workers, the, interior, environment, of, an, oil, refinery, can, reach, levels, in, excess, of, 90, db, in, the, united, states, an, average, of, 90, db, is, the, permissible, exposure, limit, pel, for, an, 8, hour, work, day, noise, exposures, that, average, greater, than, 85, db, over, an, 8, hour, require, a, hearing, conservation, program, to, regularly, evaluate, workers, hearing, and, to, promote, its, protection, regular, evaluation, of, workers, auditory, capacity, and, faithful, use, of, properly, vetted, hearing, protection, are, essential, parts, of, such, programs, while, not, specific, to, the, industry, oil, refinery, workers, may, also, be, at, risk, for, hazards, such, as, vehicle, related, accidents, machinery, associated, injuries, work, in, a, confined, space, explosions, fires, ergonomic, hazards, shift, work, related, sleep, disorders, and, falls, the, theory, of, hierarchy, of, controls, can, be, applied, to, petroleum, refineries, and, their, efforts, to, ensure, worker, safety, elimination, and, substitution, are, unlikely, in, petroleum, refineries, as, many, of, the, raw, materials, waste, products, and, finished, products, are, hazardous, in, one, form, or, another, e, g, flammable, carcinogenic, examples, of, engineering, controls, include, a, fire, detection, extinguishing, system, pressure, chemical, sensors, to, detect, predict, loss, of, structural, integrity, and, adequate, maintenance, of, piping, to, prevent, hydrocarbon, induced, corrosion, leading, to, structural, failure, other, examples, employed, in, petroleum, refineries, include, the, post, construction, protection, of, steel, components, with, vermiculite, to, improve, heat, fire, resistance, compartmentalization, can, help, to, prevent, a, fire, or, other, systems, failure, from, spreading, to, affect, other, areas, of, the, structure, and, may, help, prevent, dangerous, reactions, by, keeping, different, chemicals, separate, from, one, another, until, they, can, be, safely, combined, in, the, proper, environment, administrative, controls, include, careful, planning, and, oversight, of, the, refinery, cleaning, maintenance, and, turnaround, processes, these, occur, when, many, of, the, engineering, controls, are, shut, down, or, suppressed, and, may, be, especially, dangerous, to, workers, detailed, coordination, is, necessary, to, ensure, that, maintenance, of, one, part, of, the, facility, will, not, cause, dangerous, exposures, to, those, performing, the, maintenance, or, to, workers, in, other, areas, of, the, plant, due, to, the, highly, flammable, nature, of, many, of, the, involved, chemicals, smoking, areas, are, tightly, controlled, and, carefully, placed, personal, protective, equipment, ppe, may, be, necessary, depending, on, the, specific, chemical, being, processed, or, produced, particular, care, is, needed, during, sampling, of, the, partially, completed, product, tank, cleaning, and, other, high, risk, tasks, as, mentioned, above, such, activities, may, require, the, use, of, impervious, outerwear, acid, hood, disposable, coveralls, etc, more, generally, all, personnel, in, operating, areas, should, use, appropriate, hearing, and, vision, protection, avoid, clothes, made, of, flammable, material, nylon, dacron, acrylic, or, blends, and, full, length, pants, and, sleeves, worker, health, and, safety, in, oil, refineries, is, closely, monitored, at, a, national, level, by, both, the, occupational, safety, and, health, administration, osha, and, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, in, addition, to, federal, monitoring, california, s, calosha, has, been, particularly, active, in, protecting, worker, health, in, the, industry, and, adopted, a, policy, in, 2017, that, requires, petroleum, refineries, to, perform, a, hierarchy, of, hazard, controls, analysis, see, above, hazard, controls, section, for, each, process, safety, hazard, safety, regulations, have, resulted, in, a, below, average, injury, rate, for, refining, industry, workers, in, a, 2018, report, by, the, us, bureau, of, labor, statistics, they, indicate, that, petroleum, refinery, workers, have, a, significantly, lower, rate, of, occupational, injury, 0, 4, osha, recordable, cases, per, 100, full, time, workers, than, all, industries, 3, 1, cases, oil, and, gas, extraction, 0, 8, cases, and, petroleum, manufacturing, in, general, 1, 3, cases, below, is, a, list, of, the, most, common, regulations, referenced, in, petroleum, refinery, safety, citations, issued, by, osha, corrosion, of, metallic, components, is, a, major, factor, of, inefficiency, in, the, refining, process, because, it, leads, to, equipment, failure, it, is, a, primary, driver, for, the, refinery, maintenance, schedule, corrosion, related, direct, costs, in, the, u, s, petroleum, industry, as, of, 1996, were, estimated, at, us, 3, 7, billion, corrosion, occurs, in, various, forms, in, the, refining, process, such, as, pitting, corrosion, from, water, droplets, embrittlement, from, hydrogen, and, stress, corrosion, cracking, from, sulfide, attack, from, a, materials, standpoint, carbon, steel, is, used, for, upwards, of, 80, percent, of, refinery, components, which, is, beneficial, due, to, its, low, cost, carbon, steel, is, resistant, to, the, most, common, forms, of, corrosion, particularly, from, hydrocarbon, impurities, at, temperatures, below, 205, c, but, other, corrosive, chemicals, and, environments, prevent, its, use, everywhere, common, replacement, materials, are, low, alloy, steels, containing, chromium, and, molybdenum, with, stainless, steels, containing, more, chromium, dealing, with, more, corrosive, environments, more, expensive, materials, commonly, used, are, nickel, titanium, and, copper, alloys, these, are, primarily, saved, for, the, most, problematic, areas, where, extremely, high, temperatures, and, or, very, corrosive, chemicals, are, present, corrosion, is, fought, by, a, complex, system, of, monitoring, preventative, repairs, and, careful, use, of, materials, monitoring, methods, include, both, offline, checks, taken, during, maintenance, and, online, monitoring, offline, checks, measure, corrosion, after, it, has, occurred, telling, the, engineer, when, equipment, must, be, replaced, based, on, the, historical, information, they, have, collected, this, is, referred, to, as, preventative, management, online, systems, are, a, more, modern, development, and, are, revolutionizing, the, way, corrosion, is, approached, there, are, several, types, of, online, corrosion, monitoring, technologies, such, as, linear, polarization, resistance, electrochemical, noise, and, electrical, resistance, online, monitoring, has, generally, had, slow, reporting, rates, in, the, past, minutes, or, hours, and, been, limited, by, process, conditions, and, sources, of, error, but, newer, technologies, can, report, rates, up, to, twice, per, minute, with, much, higher, accuracy, referred, to, as, real, time, monitoring, this, allows, process, engineers, to, treat, corrosion, as, another, process, variable, that, can, be, optimized, in, the, system, immediate, responses, to, process, changes, allow, the, control, of, corrosion, mechanisms, so, they, can, be, minimized, while, also, maximizing, production, output, in, an, ideal, situation, having, on, line, corrosion, information, that, is, accurate, and, real, time, will, allow, conditions, that, cause, high, corrosion, rates, to, be, identified, and, reduced, this, is, known, as, predictive, management, materials, methods, include, selecting, the, proper, material, for, the, application, in, areas, of, minimal, corrosion, cheap, materials, are, preferable, but, when, bad, corrosion, can, occur, more, expensive, but, longer, lasting, materials, should, be, used, other, materials, methods, come, in, the, form, of, protective, barriers, between, corrosive, substances, and, the, equipment, metals, these, can, be, either, a, lining, of, refractory, material, such, as, standard, portland, cement, or, other, special, acid, resistant, cement, that, is, shot, onto, the, inner, surface, of, the, vessel, also, available, are, thin, overlays, of, more, expensive, metals, that, protect, cheaper, metal, against, corrosion, without, requiring, much, material
