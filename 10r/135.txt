in, electrical, engineering, a, capacitor, is, a, device, that, stores, electrical, energy, by, accumulating, electric, charges, on, two, closely, spaced, surfaces, that, are, insulated, from, each, other, the, capacitor, was, originally, known, as, the, condenser, a, term, still, encountered, in, a, few, compound, names, such, as, the, condenser, microphone, it, is, a, passive, electronic, component, with, two, terminals, the, utility, of, a, capacitor, depends, on, its, capacitance, while, some, capacitance, exists, between, any, two, electrical, conductors, in, proximity, in, a, circuit, a, capacitor, is, a, component, designed, specifically, to, add, capacitance, to, some, part, of, the, circuit, the, physical, form, and, construction, of, practical, capacitors, vary, widely, and, many, types, of, capacitor, are, in, common, use, most, capacitors, contain, at, least, two, electrical, conductors, often, in, the, form, of, metallic, plates, or, surfaces, separated, by, a, dielectric, medium, a, conductor, may, be, a, foil, thin, film, sintered, bead, of, metal, or, an, electrolyte, the, nonconducting, dielectric, acts, to, increase, the, capacitor, s, charge, capacity, materials, commonly, used, as, dielectrics, include, glass, ceramic, plastic, film, paper, mica, air, and, oxide, layers, when, an, electric, potential, difference, a, voltage, is, applied, across, the, terminals, of, a, capacitor, for, example, when, a, capacitor, is, connected, across, a, battery, an, electric, field, develops, across, the, dielectric, causing, a, net, positive, charge, to, collect, on, one, plate, and, net, negative, charge, to, collect, on, the, other, plate, no, current, actually, flows, through, a, perfect, dielectric, however, there, is, a, flow, of, charge, through, the, source, circuit, if, the, condition, is, maintained, sufficiently, long, the, current, through, the, source, circuit, ceases, if, a, time, varying, voltage, is, applied, across, the, leads, of, the, capacitor, the, source, experiences, an, ongoing, current, due, to, the, charging, and, discharging, cycles, of, the, capacitor, capacitors, are, widely, used, as, parts, of, electrical, circuits, in, many, common, electrical, devices, unlike, a, resistor, an, ideal, capacitor, does, not, dissipate, energy, although, real, life, capacitors, do, dissipate, a, small, amount, see, non, ideal, behavior, the, earliest, forms, of, capacitors, were, created, in, the, 1740s, when, european, experimenters, discovered, that, electric, charge, could, be, stored, in, water, filled, glass, jars, that, came, to, be, known, as, leyden, jars, today, capacitors, are, widely, used, in, electronic, circuits, for, blocking, direct, current, while, allowing, alternating, current, to, pass, in, analog, filter, networks, they, smooth, the, output, of, power, supplies, in, resonant, circuits, they, tune, radios, to, particular, frequencies, in, electric, power, transmission, systems, they, stabilize, voltage, and, power, flow, the, property, of, energy, storage, in, capacitors, was, exploited, as, dynamic, memory, in, early, digital, computers, and, still, is, in, modern, dram, natural, capacitors, have, existed, since, prehistoric, times, the, most, common, example, of, natural, capacitance, are, the, static, charges, accumulated, between, clouds, in, the, sky, and, the, surface, of, the, earth, where, the, air, between, them, serves, as, the, dielectric, this, results, in, bolts, of, lightning, when, the, breakdown, voltage, of, the, air, is, exceeded, in, october, 1745, ewald, georg, von, kleist, of, pomerania, germany, found, that, charge, could, be, stored, by, connecting, a, high, voltage, electrostatic, generator, by, a, wire, to, a, volume, of, water, in, a, hand, held, glass, jar, von, kleist, s, hand, and, the, water, acted, as, conductors, and, the, jar, as, a, dielectric, although, details, of, the, mechanism, were, incorrectly, identified, at, the, time, von, kleist, found, that, touching, the, wire, resulted, in, a, powerful, spark, much, more, painful, than, that, obtained, from, an, electrostatic, machine, the, following, year, the, dutch, physicist, pieter, van, musschenbroek, invented, a, similar, capacitor, which, was, named, the, leyden, jar, after, the, university, of, leiden, where, he, worked, he, also, was, impressed, by, the, power, of, the, shock, he, received, writing, i, would, not, take, a, second, shock, for, the, kingdom, of, france, daniel, gralath, was, the, first, to, combine, several, jars, in, parallel, to, increase, the, charge, storage, capacity, benjamin, franklin, investigated, the, leyden, jar, and, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, charge, was, stored, on, the, glass, not, in, the, water, as, others, had, assumed, he, also, adopted, the, term, battery, denoting, the, increase, of, power, with, a, row, of, similar, units, as, in, a, battery, of, cannon, subsequently, applied, to, clusters, of, electrochemical, cells, in, 1747, leyden, jars, were, made, by, coating, the, inside, and, outside, of, jars, with, metal, foil, leaving, a, space, at, the, mouth, to, prevent, arcing, between, the, foils, the, earliest, unit, of, capacitance, was, the, jar, equivalent, to, about, 1, 11, nanofarads, leyden, jars, or, more, powerful, devices, employing, flat, glass, plates, alternating, with, foil, conductors, were, used, exclusively, up, until, about, 1900, when, the, invention, of, wireless, radio, created, a, demand, for, standard, capacitors, and, the, steady, move, to, higher, frequencies, required, capacitors, with, lower, inductance, more, compact, construction, methods, began, to, be, used, such, as, a, flexible, dielectric, sheet, like, oiled, paper, sandwiched, between, sheets, of, metal, foil, rolled, or, folded, into, a, small, package, early, capacitors, were, known, as, condensers, a, term, that, is, still, occasionally, used, today, particularly, in, high, power, applications, such, as, automotive, systems, the, term, condensatore, was, used, by, alessandro, volta, in, 1780, to, refer, to, a, device, similar, to, his, electrophorus, he, developed, to, measure, electricity, and, translated, in, 1782, as, condenser, where, the, name, referred, to, the, device, s, ability, to, store, a, higher, density, of, electric, charge, than, was, possible, with, an, isolated, conductor, the, term, became, deprecated, because, of, the, ambiguous, meaning, of, steam, condenser, with, capacitor, becoming, the, recommended, term, in, the, uk, from, 1926, while, the, change, occurred, considerably, later, in, the, united, states, since, the, beginning, of, the, study, of, electricity, non, conductive, materials, like, glass, porcelain, paper, and, mica, have, been, used, as, insulators, decades, later, these, materials, were, also, well, suited, for, use, as, the, dielectric, for, the, first, capacitors, paper, capacitors, made, by, sandwiching, a, strip, of, impregnated, paper, between, strips, of, metal, and, rolling, the, result, into, a, cylinder, were, commonly, used, in, the, late, 19th, century, their, manufacture, started, in, 1876, and, they, were, used, from, the, early, 20th, century, as, decoupling, capacitors, in, telephony, porcelain, was, used, in, the, first, ceramic, capacitors, in, the, early, years, of, marconi, s, wireless, transmitting, apparatus, porcelain, capacitors, were, used, for, high, voltage, and, high, frequency, application, in, the, transmitters, on, the, receiver, side, smaller, mica, capacitors, were, used, for, resonant, circuits, mica, capacitors, were, invented, in, 1909, by, william, dubilier, prior, to, world, war, ii, mica, was, the, most, common, dielectric, for, capacitors, in, the, united, states, charles, pollak, born, karol, pollak, the, inventor, of, the, first, electrolytic, capacitors, found, out, that, the, oxide, layer, on, an, aluminum, anode, remained, stable, in, a, neutral, or, alkaline, electrolyte, even, when, the, power, was, switched, off, in, 1896, he, was, granted, u, s, patent, no, 672, 913, for, an, electric, liquid, capacitor, with, aluminum, electrodes, solid, electrolyte, tantalum, capacitors, were, invented, by, bell, laboratories, in, the, early, 1950s, as, a, miniaturized, and, more, reliable, low, voltage, support, capacitor, to, complement, their, newly, invented, transistor, with, the, development, of, plastic, materials, by, organic, chemists, during, the, second, world, war, the, capacitor, industry, began, to, replace, paper, with, thinner, polymer, films, one, very, early, development, in, film, capacitors, was, described, in, british, patent, 587, 953, in, 1944, electric, double, layer, capacitors, now, supercapacitors, were, invented, in, 1957, when, h, becker, developed, a, low, voltage, electrolytic, capacitor, with, porous, carbon, electrodes, he, believed, that, the, energy, was, stored, as, a, charge, in, the, carbon, pores, used, in, his, capacitor, as, in, the, pores, of, the, etched, foils, of, electrolytic, capacitors, because, the, double, layer, mechanism, was, not, known, by, him, at, the, time, he, wrote, in, the, patent, it, is, not, known, exactly, what, is, taking, place, in, the, component, if, it, is, used, for, energy, storage, but, it, leads, to, an, extremely, high, capacity, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, capacitor, mos, capacitor, originates, from, the, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, mosfet, structure, where, the, mos, capacitor, is, flanked, by, two, doped, regions, the, mosfet, structure, was, invented, by, mohamed, m, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, at, bell, labs, in, 1959, the, mos, capacitor, was, later, widely, adopted, as, a, storage, capacitor, in, memory, chips, and, as, the, basic, building, block, of, the, charge, coupled, device, ccd, in, image, sensor, technology, in, dynamic, random, access, memory, dram, each, memory, cell, typically, consists, of, a, mosfet, and, mos, capacitor, a, capacitor, consists, of, two, conductors, separated, by, a, non, conductive, region, the, non, conductive, region, can, either, be, a, vacuum, or, an, electrical, insulator, material, known, as, a, dielectric, examples, of, dielectric, media, are, glass, air, paper, plastic, ceramic, and, even, a, semiconductor, depletion, region, chemically, identical, to, the, conductors, from, coulomb, s, law, a, charge, on, one, conductor, will, exert, a, force, on, the, charge, carriers, within, the, other, conductor, attracting, opposite, polarity, charge, and, repelling, like, polarity, charges, thus, an, opposite, polarity, charge, will, be, induced, on, the, surface, of, the, other, conductor, the, conductors, thus, hold, equal, and, opposite, charges, on, their, facing, surfaces, and, the, dielectric, develops, an, electric, field, an, ideal, capacitor, is, characterized, by, a, constant, capacitance, c, in, farads, in, the, si, system, of, units, defined, as, the, ratio, of, the, positive, or, negative, charge, q, on, each, conductor, to, the, voltage, v, between, them, c, q, v, displaystyle, c, frac, q, v, a, capacitance, of, one, farad, f, means, that, one, coulomb, of, charge, on, each, conductor, causes, a, voltage, of, one, volt, across, the, device, because, the, conductors, or, plates, are, close, together, the, opposite, charges, on, the, conductors, attract, one, another, due, to, their, electric, fields, allowing, the, capacitor, to, store, more, charge, for, a, given, voltage, than, when, the, conductors, are, separated, yielding, a, larger, capacitance, in, practical, devices, charge, build, up, sometimes, affects, the, capacitor, mechanically, causing, its, capacitance, to, vary, in, this, case, capacitance, is, defined, in, terms, of, incremental, changes, c, d, q, d, v, displaystyle, c, frac, mathrm, d, q, mathrm, d, v, in, the, hydraulic, analogy, voltage, is, analogous, to, water, pressure, and, electrical, current, through, a, wire, is, analogous, to, water, flow, through, a, pipe, a, capacitor, is, like, an, elastic, diaphragm, within, the, pipe, although, water, cannot, pass, through, the, diaphragm, it, moves, as, the, diaphragm, stretches, or, un, stretches, in, a, circuit, a, capacitor, can, behave, differently, at, different, time, instants, however, it, is, usually, easy, to, think, about, the, short, time, limit, and, long, time, limit, the, simplest, model, of, a, capacitor, consists, of, two, thin, parallel, conductive, plates, each, with, an, area, of, a, displaystyle, a, separated, by, a, uniform, gap, of, thickness, d, displaystyle, d, filled, with, a, dielectric, of, permittivity, displaystyle, varepsilon, it, is, assumed, the, gap, d, displaystyle, d, is, much, smaller, than, the, dimensions, of, the, plates, this, model, applies, well, to, many, practical, capacitors, which, are, constructed, of, metal, sheets, separated, by, a, thin, layer, of, insulating, dielectric, since, manufacturers, try, to, keep, the, dielectric, very, uniform, in, thickness, to, avoid, thin, spots, which, can, cause, failure, of, the, capacitor, since, the, separation, between, the, plates, is, uniform, over, the, plate, area, the, electric, field, between, the, plates, e, displaystyle, e, is, constant, and, directed, perpendicularly, to, the, plate, surface, except, for, an, area, near, the, edges, of, the, plates, where, the, field, decreases, because, the, electric, field, lines, bulge, out, of, the, sides, of, the, capacitor, this, fringing, field, area, is, approximately, the, same, width, as, the, plate, separation, d, displaystyle, d, and, assuming, d, displaystyle, d, is, small, compared, to, the, plate, dimensions, it, is, small, enough, to, be, ignored, therefore, if, a, charge, of, q, displaystyle, q, is, placed, on, one, plate, and, q, displaystyle, q, on, the, other, plate, the, situation, for, unevenly, charged, plates, is, discussed, below, the, charge, on, each, plate, will, be, spread, evenly, in, a, surface, charge, layer, of, constant, charge, density, q, a, displaystyle, sigma, pm, q, a, coulombs, per, square, meter, on, the, inside, surface, of, each, plate, from, gauss, s, law, the, magnitude, of, the, electric, field, between, the, plates, is, e, displaystyle, e, sigma, varepsilon, the, voltage, difference, v, displaystyle, v, between, the, plates, is, defined, as, the, line, integral, of, the, electric, field, over, a, line, in, the, z, direction, from, one, plate, to, another, v, 0, d, e, z, d, z, e, d, d, q, d, a, displaystyle, v, int, 0, d, e, z, mathrm, d, z, ed, frac, sigma, varepsilon, d, frac, qd, varepsilon, a, the, capacitance, is, defined, as, c, q, v, displaystyle, c, q, v, substituting, v, displaystyle, v, above, into, this, equation, c, a, d, displaystyle, c, frac, varepsilon, a, d, therefore, in, a, capacitor, the, highest, capacitance, is, achieved, with, a, high, permittivity, dielectric, material, large, plate, area, and, small, separation, between, the, plates, since, the, area, a, displaystyle, a, of, the, plates, increases, with, the, square, of, the, linear, dimensions, and, the, separation, d, displaystyle, d, increases, linearly, the, capacitance, scales, with, the, linear, dimension, of, a, capacitor, c, l, displaystyle, c, varpropto, l, or, as, the, cube, root, of, the, volume, a, parallel, plate, capacitor, can, only, store, a, finite, amount, of, energy, before, dielectric, breakdown, occurs, the, capacitor, s, dielectric, material, has, a, dielectric, strength, u, d, which, sets, the, capacitor, s, breakdown, voltage, at, v, v, bd, u, d, d, the, maximum, energy, that, the, capacitor, can, store, is, therefore, e, 1, 2, c, v, 2, 1, 2, a, d, u, d, d, 2, 1, 2, a, d, u, d, 2, displaystyle, e, frac, 1, 2, cv, 2, frac, 1, 2, frac, varepsilon, a, d, left, u, d, d, right, 2, frac, 1, 2, varepsilon, adu, d, 2, the, maximum, energy, is, a, function, of, dielectric, volume, permittivity, and, dielectric, strength, changing, the, plate, area, and, the, separation, between, the, plates, while, maintaining, the, same, volume, causes, no, change, of, the, maximum, amount, of, energy, that, the, capacitor, can, store, so, long, as, the, distance, between, plates, remains, much, smaller, than, both, the, length, and, width, of, the, plates, in, addition, these, equations, assume, that, the, electric, field, is, entirely, concentrated, in, the, dielectric, between, the, plates, in, reality, there, are, fringing, fields, outside, the, dielectric, for, example, between, the, sides, of, the, capacitor, plates, which, increase, the, effective, capacitance, of, the, capacitor, this, is, sometimes, called, parasitic, capacitance, for, some, simple, capacitor, geometries, this, additional, capacitance, term, can, be, calculated, analytically, it, becomes, negligibly, small, when, the, ratios, of, plate, width, to, separation, and, length, to, separation, are, large, for, unevenly, charged, plates, for, n, displaystyle, n, number, of, plates, in, a, capacitor, the, total, capacitance, would, be, c, o, a, d, n, 1, displaystyle, c, varepsilon, o, frac, a, d, n, 1, where, c, o, a, d, displaystyle, c, varepsilon, o, a, d, is, the, capacitance, for, a, single, plate, and, n, displaystyle, n, is, the, number, of, interleaved, plates, as, shown, to, the, figure, on, the, right, the, interleaved, plates, can, be, seen, as, parallel, plates, connected, to, each, other, every, pair, of, adjacent, plates, acts, as, a, separate, capacitor, the, number, of, pairs, is, always, one, less, than, the, number, of, plates, hence, the, n, 1, displaystyle, n, 1, multiplier, to, increase, the, charge, and, voltage, on, a, capacitor, work, must, be, done, by, an, external, power, source, to, move, charge, from, the, negative, to, the, positive, plate, against, the, opposing, force, of, the, electric, field, if, the, voltage, on, the, capacitor, is, v, displaystyle, v, the, work, d, w, displaystyle, dw, required, to, move, a, small, increment, of, charge, d, q, displaystyle, dq, from, the, negative, to, the, positive, plate, is, d, w, v, d, q, displaystyle, dw, vdq, the, energy, is, stored, in, the, increased, electric, field, between, the, plates, the, total, energy, w, displaystyle, w, stored, in, a, capacitor, expressed, in, joules, is, equal, to, the, total, work, done, in, establishing, the, electric, field, from, an, uncharged, state, w, 0, q, v, q, d, q, 0, q, q, c, d, q, 1, 2, q, 2, c, 1, 2, v, q, 1, 2, c, v, 2, displaystyle, w, int, 0, q, v, q, mathrm, d, q, int, 0, q, frac, q, c, mathrm, d, q, frac,

displaystyle, c, is, the, capacitance, this, potential, energy, will, remain, in, the, capacitor, until, the, charge, is, removed, if, charge, is, allowed, to, move, back, from, the, positive, to, the, negative, plate, for, example, by, connecting, a, circuit, with, resistance, between, the, plates, the, charge, moving, under, the, influence, of, the, electric, field, will, do, work, on, the, external, circuit, if, the, gap, between, the, capacitor, plates, d, displaystyle, d, is, constant, as, in, the, parallel, plate, model, above, the, electric, field, between, the, plates, will, be, uniform, neglecting, fringing, fields, and, will, have, a, constant, value, e, v, d, displaystyle, e, v, d, in, this, case, the, stored, energy, can, be, calculated, from, the, electric, field,

component, in, an, electric, circuit, is, defined, as, the, rate, of, flow, of, a, charge, q, t, passing, through, it, actual, charges, electrons, cannot, pass, through, the, dielectric, of, an, ideal, capacitor, rather, one, electron, accumulates, on, the, negative, plate, for, each, one, that, leaves, the, positive, plate, resulting, in, an, electron, depletion, and, consequent, positive, charge, on, one, electrode, that, is, equal, and, opposite, to, the, accumulated, negative, charge, on, the, other, thus, the, charge, on, the, electrodes, is, equal, to, the, integral, of, the, current, as, well, as, proportional, to, the, voltage, as, discussed, above, as, with, any, antiderivative, a, constant, of, integration, is, added, to, represent, the, initial, voltage, v, t, 0,

results, in, a, lower, voltage, amplitude, per, current, amplitude, an, ac, short, circuit, or, ac, coupling, conversely, for, very, low, frequencies, the, reactance, is, high, so, that, a, capacitor, is, nearly, an, open, circuit, in, ac, analysis, those, frequencies, have, been, filtered, out, capacitors, are, different, from, resistors, and, inductors, in, that, the, impedance, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, defining, characteristic, i, e, capacitance, a, capacitor, connected, to, an, alternating, voltage, source, has, a, displacement, current, to, flowing, through, it, in, the,

several, aspects, some, of, these, such, as, leakage, current, and, parasitic, effects, are, linear, or, can, be, analyzed, as, nearly, linear, and, can, be, accounted, for, by, adding, virtual, components, to, form, an, equivalent, circuit, the, usual, methods, of, network, analysis, can, then, be, applied, in, other, cases, such, as, with, breakdown, voltage, the, effect, is, non, linear, and, ordinary, normal, e, g, linear, network, analysis, cannot, be, used, the, effect, must, be, considered, separately, yet, another, group, of, artifacts, may, exist, including, temperature, dependence, that, may, be, linear, but, invalidates, the, assumption, in, the, analysis, that, capacitance, is, a, constant, finally, combined, parasitic, effects, such, as, inherent, inductance, resistance, or, dielectric, losses, can, exhibit, non, uniform, behavior, at, varying, frequencies, of, operation, above, a, particular, electric, field, strength, known, as, the, dielectric, strength, e, ds, the, dielectric, in, a, capacitor, becomes, conductive, the, voltage, at, which, this, occurs, is, called, the, breakdown, voltage, of, the, device, and, is, given, by, the, product, of, the, dielectric, strength, and, the, separation, between, the, conductors, v, bd, e, ds, d, displaystyle, v, text, bd, e, text, ds, d, the, maximum, energy, that, can, be, stored, safely, in, a, capacitor, is, limited, by, the, breakdown, voltage, exceeding, this, voltage, can, result, in, a, short, circuit, between, the, plates, which, can, often, cause, permanent, damage, to, the, dielectric, plates, or, both, due, to, the, scaling, of, capacitance, and, breakdown, voltage, with, dielectric, thickness, all, capacitors, made, with, a, particular, dielectric, have, approximately, equal, maximum, energy, density, to, the, extent, that, the, dielectric, dominates, their, volume, for, air, dielectric, capacitors, the, breakdown, field, strength, is, of, the, order, 2, 5, mv, m, or, kv, mm, for, mica, the, breakdown, is, 100, 300, mv, m, for, oil, 15, 25, mv, m, it, can, be, much, less, when, other, materials, are, used, for, the, dielectric, the, dielectric, is, used, in, very, thin, layers, and, so, absolute, breakdown, voltage, of, capacitors, is, limited, typical, ratings, for, capacitors, used, for, general, electronics, applications, range, from, a, few, volts, to, 1, kv, as, the, voltage, increases, the, dielectric, must, be, thicker, making, high, voltage, capacitors, larger, per, capacitance, than, those, rated, for, lower, voltages, the, breakdown, voltage, is, critically, affected, by, factors, such, as, the, geometry, of, the, capacitor, conductive, parts, sharp, edges, or, points, increase, the, electric, field, strength, at, that, point, and, can, lead, to, a, local, breakdown, once, this, starts, to, happen, the, breakdown, quickly, tracks, through, the, dielectric, until, it, reaches, the, opposite, plate, leaving, carbon, behind, and, causing, a, short, or, relatively, low, resistance, circuit, the, results, can, be, explosive, as, the, short, in, the, capacitor, draws, current, from, the, surrounding, circuitry, and, dissipates, the, energy, however, in, capacitors, with, particular, dielectrics, and, thin, metal, electrodes, shorts, are, not, formed, after, breakdown, it, happens, because, a, metal, melts, or, evaporates, in, a, breakdown, vicinity, isolating, it, from, the, rest, of, the, capacitor, the, usual, breakdown, route, is, that, the, field, strength, becomes, large, enough, to, pull, electrons, in, the, dielectric, from, their, atoms, thus, causing, conduction, other, scenarios, are, possible, such, as, impurities, in, the, dielectric, and, if, the, dielectric, is, of, a, crystalline, nature, imperfections, in, the, crystal, structure, can, result, in, an, avalanche, breakdown, as, seen, in, semi, conductor, devices, breakdown, voltage, is, also, affected, by, pressure, humidity, and, temperature, an, ideal, capacitor, only, stores, and, releases, electrical, energy, without, dissipation, in, practice, capacitors, have, imperfections, within, the, capacitor, s, materials, that, result, in, the, following, parasitic, components, as, frequency, increases, the, capacitive, impedance, a, negative, reactance, reduces, so, the, dielectric, s, conductance, becomes, less, important, and, the, series, components, become, more, significant, thus, a, simplified, rlc, series, model, valid, for, a, large, frequency, range, simply, treats, the, capacitor, as, being, in, series, with, an, equivalent, series, inductance, esl, displaystyle, text, esl, and, a, frequency, dependent, equivalent, series, resistance, esr, displaystyle, text, esr, which, varies, little, with, frequency, unlike, the, previous, model, this, model, is, not, valid, at, dc, and, very, low, frequencies, where, g, dielectric, displaystyle, g, text, dielectric, is, relevant, inductive, reactance, increases, with, frequency, because, its, sign, is, positive, it, counteracts, the, capacitance, at, the, rlc, circuit, s, natural, frequency, 0, 1, esl, c, displaystyle, omega, 0, tfrac, 1, sqrt, text, esl, cdot, text, c, the, inductance, perfectly, cancels, the, capacitance, so, total, reactance, is, zero, since, the, total, impedance, at, 0, displaystyle, omega, 0, is, just, the, real, value, of, esr, displaystyle, text, esr, average, power, dissipation, reaches, its, maximum, of, v, rms, 2, esr, where, v, rms, is, the, root, mean, square, rms, voltage, across, the, capacitor, at, even, higher, frequencies, the, inductive, impedance, dominates, so, the, capacitor, undesirably, behaves, instead, like, an, inductor, high, frequency, engineering, involves, accounting, for, the, inductance, of, all, connections, and, components, for, a, simplified, model, of, a, capacitor, as, an, ideal, capacitor, in, series, with, an, equivalent, series, resistance, esr, displaystyle, text,

higher, the, q, factor, of, the, capacitor, the, closer, it, approaches, the, behavior, of, an, ideal, capacitor, dissipation, factor, is, its, reciprocal, ripple, current, is, the, ac, component, of, an, applied, source, often, a, switched, mode, power, supply, whose, frequency, may, be, constant, or, varying, ripple, current, causes, heat, to, be, generated, within, the, capacitor, due, to, the, dielectric, losses, caused, by, the, changing, field, strength, together, with, the, current, flow, across, the, slightly, resistive, supply, lines, or, the, electrolyte, in, the, capacitor, the, equivalent, series, resistance, esr, is, the, amount, of, internal, series, resistance, one, would, add, to, a, perfect, capacitor, to, model, this, some, types, of, capacitors, primarily, tantalum, and, aluminum, electrolytic, capacitors, as, well, as, some, film, capacitors, have, a, specified, rating, value, for, maximum, ripple, current, the, capacitance, of, certain, capacitors, decreases, as, the, component, ages, in, ceramic, capacitors, this, is, caused, by, degradation, of, the, dielectric, the, type, of, dielectric, ambient, operating, and, storage, temperatures, are, the, most, significant, aging, factors, while, the, operating, voltage, usually, has, a, smaller, effect, i, e, usual, capacitor, design, is, to, minimize, voltage, coefficient, the, aging, process, may, be, reversed, by, heating, the, component, above, the, curie, point, aging, is, fastest, near, the, beginning, of, life, of, the, component, and, the, device, stabilizes, over, time, electrolytic, capacitors, age, as, the, electrolyte, evaporates, in, contrast, with, ceramic, capacitors, this, occurs, towards, the, end, of, life, of, the, component, temperature, dependence, of, capacitance, is, usually, expressed, in, parts, per, million, ppm, per, c, it, can, usually, be, taken, as, a, broadly, linear, function, but, can, be, noticeably, non, linear, at, the, temperature, extremes, the, temperature, coefficient, may, be, positive, or, negative, depending, mostly, on, the, dielectric, material, some, designated, c0g, np0, but, called, npo, have, a, somewhat, negative, coefficient, at, one, temperature, positive, at, another, and, zero, in, between, such, components, may, be, specified, for, temperature, critical, circuits, capacitors, especially, ceramic, capacitors, and, older, designs, such, as, paper, capacitors, can, absorb, sound, waves, resulting, in, a, microphonic, effect, vibration, moves, the, plates, causing, the, capacitance, to, vary, in, turn, inducing, ac, current, some, dielectrics, also, generate, piezoelectricity, the, resulting, interference, is, especially, problematic, in, audio, applications, potentially, causing, feedback, or, unintended, recording, in, the, reverse, microphonic, effect, the, varying, electric, field, between, the, capacitor, plates, exerts, a, physical, force, moving, them, as, a, speaker, this, can, generate, audible, sound, but, drains, energy, and, stresses, the, dielectric, and, the, electrolyte, if, any, current, reversal, occurs, when, the, current, changes, direction, voltage, reversal, is, the, change, of, polarity, in, a, circuit, reversal, is, generally, described, as, the, percentage, of, the, maximum, rated, voltage, that, reverses, polarity, in, dc, circuits, this, is, usually, less, than, 100, often, in, the, range, of, 0, to, 90, whereas, ac, circuits, experience, 100, reversal, in, dc, circuits, and, pulsed, circuits, current, and, voltage, reversal, are, affected, by, the, damping, of, the, system, voltage, reversal, is, encountered, in, rlc, circuits, that, are, underdamped, the, current, and, voltage, reverse, direction, forming, a, harmonic, oscillator, between, the, inductance, and, capacitance, the, current, and, voltage, tends, to, oscillate, and, may, reverse, direction, several, times, with, each, peak, being, lower, than, the, previous, until, the, system, reaches, an, equilibrium, this, is, often, referred, to, as, ringing, in, comparison, critically, damped, or, overdamped, systems, usually, do, not, experience, a, voltage, reversal, reversal, is, also, encountered, in, ac, circuits, where, the, peak, current, is, equal, in, each, direction, for, maximum, life, capacitors, usually, need, to, be, able, to, handle, the, maximum, amount, of, reversal, that, a, system, may, experience, an, ac, circuit, experiences, 100, voltage, reversal, while, underdamped, dc, circuits, experience, less, than, 100, reversal, creates, excess, electric, fields, in, the, dielectric, causes, excess, heating, of, both, the, dielectric, and, the, conductors, and, can, dramatically, shorten, the, life, expectancy, of, the, capacitor, reversal, ratings, often, affect, the, design, considerations, for, the, capacitor, from, the, choice, of, dielectric, materials, and, voltage, ratings, to, the, types, of, internal, connections, used, capacitors, made, with, any, type, of, dielectric, material, show, some, level, of, dielectric, absorption, or, soakage, on, discharging, a, capacitor, and, disconnecting, it, after, a, short, time, it, may, develop, a, voltage, due, to, hysteresis, in, the, dielectric, this, effect, is, objectionable, in, applications, such, as, precision, sample, and, hold, circuits, or, timing, circuits, the, level, of, absorption, depends, on, many, factors, from, design, considerations, to, charging, time, since, the, absorption, is, a, time, dependent, process, however, the, primary, factor, is, the, type, of, dielectric, material, capacitors, such, as, tantalum, electrolytic, or, polysulfone, film, exhibit, relatively, high, absorption, while, polystyrene, or, teflon, allow, very, small, levels, of, absorption, in, some, capacitors, where, dangerous, voltages, and, energies, exist, such, as, in, flashtubes, television, sets, microwave, ovens, and, defibrillators, the, dielectric, absorption, can, recharge, the, capacitor, to, hazardous, voltages, after, it, has, been, shorted, or, discharged, any, capacitor, containing, over, 10, joules, of, energy, is, generally, considered, hazardous, while, 50, joules, or, higher, is, potentially, lethal, a, capacitor, may, regain, anywhere, from, 0, 01, to, 20, of, its, original, charge, over, a, period, of, several, minutes, allowing, a, seemingly, safe, capacitor, to, become, surprisingly, dangerous, no, material, is, a, perfect, insulator, thus, all, dielectrics, allow, some, small, level, of, current, to, leak, through, which, can, be, measured, with, a, megohmmeter, leakage, is, equivalent, to, a, resistor, in, parallel, with, the, capacitor, constant, exposure, to, factors, such, as, heat, mechanical, stress, or, humidity, can, cause, the, dielectric, to, deteriorate, resulting, in, excessive, leakage, a, problem, often, seen, in, older, vacuum, tube, circuits, particularly, where, oiled, paper, and, foil, capacitors, were, used, in, many, vacuum, tube, circuits, interstage, coupling, capacitors, are, used, to, conduct, a, varying, signal, from, the, plate, of, one, tube, to, the, grid, circuit, of, the, next, stage, a, leaky, capacitor, can, cause, the, grid, circuit, voltage, to, be, raised, from, its, normal, bias, setting, causing, excessive, current, or, signal, distortion, in, the, downstream, tube, in, power, amplifiers, this, can, cause, the, plates, to, glow, red, or, current, limiting, resistors, to, overheat, even, fail, similar, considerations, apply, to, component, fabricated, solid, state, transistor, amplifiers, but, owing, to, lower, heat, production, and, the, use, of, modern, polyester, dielectric, barriers, this, once, common, problem, has, become, relatively, rare, aluminum, electrolytic, capacitors, are, conditioned, when, manufactured, by, applying, a, voltage, sufficient, to, initiate, the, proper, internal, chemical, state, this, state, is, maintained, by, regular, use, of, the, equipment, if, a, system, using, electrolytic, capacitors, is, unused, for, a, long, period, of, time, it, can, lose, its, conditioning, sometimes, they, fail, with, a, short, circuit, when, next, operated, all, capacitors, have, varying, lifespans, depending, upon, their, construction, operational, conditions, and, environmental, conditions, solid, state, ceramic, capacitors, generally, have, very, long, lives, under, normal, use, which, has, little, dependency, on, factors, such, as, vibration, or, ambient, temperature, but, factors, like, humidity, mechanical, stress, and, fatigue, play, a, primary, role, in, their, failure, failure, modes, may, differ, some, capacitors, may, experience, a, gradual, loss, of, capacitance, increased, leakage, or, an, increase, in, equivalent, series, resistance, esr, while, others, may, fail, suddenly, or, even, catastrophically, for, example, metal, film, capacitors, are, more, prone, to, damage, from, stress, and, humidity, but, will, self, heal, when, a, breakdown, in, the, dielectric, occurs, the, formation, of, a, glow, discharge, at, the, point, of, failure, prevents, arcing, by, vaporizing, the, metallic, film, in, that, spot, neutralizing, any, short, circuit, with, minimal, loss, in, capacitance, when, enough, pinholes, accumulate, in, the, film, a, total, failure, occurs, in, a, metal, film, capacitor, generally, happening, suddenly, without, warning, electrolytic, capacitors, generally, have, the, shortest, lifespans, electrolytic, capacitors, are, affected, very, little, by, vibration, or, humidity, but, factors, such, as, ambient, and, operational, temperatures, play, a, large, role, in, their, failure, which, gradually, occur, as, an, increase, in, esr, up, to, 300, and, as, much, as, a, 20, decrease, in, capacitance, the, capacitors, contain, electrolytes, which, will, eventually, diffuse, through, the, seals, and, evaporate, an, increase, in, temperature, also, increases, internal, pressure, and, increases, the, reaction, rate, of, the, chemicals, thus, the, life, of, an, electrolytic, capacitor, is, generally, defined, by, a, modification, of, the, arrhenius, equation, which, is, used, to, determine, chemical, reaction, rates, l, b, e, e, a, k, t, o, displaystyle, l, be, frac, e, a, kt, o, manufacturers, often, use, this, equation, to, supply, an, expected, lifespan, in, hours, for, electrolytic, capacitors, when, used, at, their, designed, operating, temperature, which, is, affected, by, both, ambient, temperature, esr, and, ripple, current, however, these, ideal, conditions, may, not, exist, in, every, use, the, rule, of, thumb, for, predicting, lifespan, under, different, conditions, of, use, is, determined, by, l, a, l, 0, 2, t, 0, t, a, 10, displaystyle, l, a, l, 0, 2, frac, t, 0, t, a, 10, this, says, that, the, capacitor, s, life, decreases, by, half, for, every, 10, degrees, celsius, that, the, temperature, is, increased, where, practical, capacitors, are, available, commercially, in, many, different, forms, the, type, of, internal, dielectric, the, structure, of, the, plates, and, the, device, packaging, all, strongly, affect, the, characteristics, of, the, capacitor, and, its, applications, values, available, range, from, very, low, picofarad, range, while, arbitrarily, low, values, are, in, principle, possible, stray, parasitic, capacitance, in, any, circuit, is, the, limiting, factor, to, about, 5, kf, supercapacitors, above, approximately, 1, microfarad, electrolytic, capacitors, are, usually, used, because, of, their, small, size, and, low, cost, compared, with, other, types, unless, their, relatively, poor, stability, life, and, polarised, nature, make, them, unsuitable, very, high, capacity, supercapacitors, use, a, porous, carbon, based, electrode, material, most, capacitors, have, a, dielectric, spacer, which, increases, their, capacitance, compared, to, air, or, a, vacuum, in, order, to, maximise, the, charge, that, a, capacitor, can, hold, the, dielectric, material, needs, to, have, as, high, a, permittivity, as, possible, while, also, having, as, high, a, breakdown, voltage, as, possible, the, dielectric, also, needs, to, have, as, low, a, loss, with, frequency, as, possible, however, low, value, capacitors, are, available, with, a, high, vacuum, between, their, plates, to, allow, extremely, high, voltage, operation, and, low, losses, variable, capacitors, with, their, plates, open, to, the, atmosphere, were, commonly, used, in, radio, tuning, circuits, later, designs, use, polymer, foil, dielectric, between, the, moving, and, stationary, plates, with, no, significant, air, space, between, the, plates, several, solid, dielectrics, are, available, including, paper, plastic, glass, mica, and, ceramic, paper, was, used, extensively, in, older, capacitors, and, offers, relatively, high, voltage, performance, however, paper, absorbs, moisture, and, has, been, largely, replaced, by, plastic, film, capacitors, most, of, the, plastic, films, now, used, offer, better, stability, and, ageing, performance, than, such, older, dielectrics, such, as, oiled, paper, which, makes, them, useful, in, timer, circuits, although, they, may, be, limited, to, relatively, low, operating, temperatures, and, frequencies, because, of, the, limitations, of, the, plastic, film, being, used, large, plastic, film, capacitors, are, used, extensively, in, suppression, circuits, motor, start, circuits, and, power, factor, correction, circuits, ceramic, capacitors, are, generally, small, cheap, and, useful, for, high, frequency, applications, although, their, capacitance, varies, strongly, with, voltage, and, temperature, and, they, age, poorly, they, can, also, suffer, from, the, piezoelectric, effect, ceramic, capacitors, are, broadly, categorized, as, class, 1, dielectrics, which, have, predictable, variation, of, capacitance, with, temperature, or, class, 2, dielectrics, which, can, operate, at, higher, voltage, modern, multilayer, ceramics, are, usually, quite, small, but, some, types, have, inherently, wide, value, tolerances, microphonic, issues, and, are, usually, physically, brittle, glass, and, mica, capacitors, are, extremely, reliable, stable, and, tolerant, to, high, temperatures, and, voltages, but, are, too, expensive, for, most, mainstream, applications, electrolytic, capacitors, and, supercapacitors, are, used, to, store, small, and, larger, amounts, of, energy, respectively, ceramic, capacitors, are, often, used, in, resonators, and, parasitic, capacitance, occurs, in, circuits, wherever, the, simple, conductor, insulator, conductor, structure, is, formed, unintentionally, by, the, configuration, of, the, circuit,

heat, and, high, leakage, current, poor, quality, capacitors, may, leak, electrolyte, which, is, harmful, to, printed, circuit, boards, the, conductivity, of, the, electrolyte, drops, at, low, temperatures, which, increases, equivalent, series, resistance, while, widely, used, for, power, supply, conditioning, poor, high, frequency, characteristics, make, them, unsuitable, for, many, applications, electrolytic, capacitors, suffer, from, self, degradation, if, unused, for, a, period, around, a, year, and, when, full, power, is, applied, may, short, circuit, permanently, damaging, the, capacitor, and, usually, blowing, a, fuse, or, causing, failure, of, rectifier, diodes, for, example, in, older, equipment, this, may, cause, arcing, in, rectifier, tubes, they, can, be, restored, before, use, by, gradually, applying, the, operating, voltage, often, performed, on, antique, vacuum, tube, equipment, over, a, period, of, thirty, minutes, by, using, a, variable, transformer, to, supply, ac, power, the, use, of, this, technique, may, be, less, satisfactory, for, some, solid, state, equipment, which, may, be, damaged, by, operation, below, its, normal, power, range, requiring, that, the, power, supply, first, be, isolated, from, the, consuming, circuits, such, remedies, may, not, be, applicable, to, modern, high, frequency, power, supplies, as, these,

easily, grounded, earthed, they, also, are, designed, with, direct, current, breakdown, voltages, of, at, least, five, times, the, maximum, ac, voltage, the, dielectric, constant, for, a, number, of, very, useful, dielectrics, changes, as, a, function, of, the, applied, electrical, field, for, example, ferroelectric, materials, so, the, capacitance, for, these, devices, is, more, complex, for, example, in, charging, such, a, capacitor, the, differential, increase, in, voltage, with, charge, is, governed, by, d, q, c, v, d, v, displaystyle, dq, c, v, dv, where, the, voltage, dependence, of,
