a, factory, manufacturing, plant, or, production, plant, is, an, industrial, facility, often, a, complex, consisting, of, several, buildings, filled, with, machinery, where, workers, manufacture, items, or, operate, machines, which, process, each, item, into, another, they, are, a, critical, part, of, modern, economic, production, with, the, majority, of, the, world, s, goods, being, created, or, processed, within, factories, factories, arose, with, the, introduction, of, machinery, during, the, industrial, revolution, when, the, capital, and, space, requirements, became, too, great, for, cottage, industry, or, workshops, early, factories, that, contained, small, amounts, of, machinery, such, as, one, or, two, spinning, mules, and, fewer, than, a, dozen, workers, have, been, called, glorified, workshops, most, modern, factories, have, large, warehouses, or, warehouse, like, facilities, that, contain, heavy, equipment, used, for, assembly, line, production, large, factories, tend, to, be, located, with, access, to, multiple, modes, of, transportation, some, having, rail, highway, and, water, loading, and, unloading, facilities, in, some, countries, like, australia, it, is, common, to, call, a, factory, building, a, shed, factories, may, either, make, discrete, products, or, some, type, of, continuously, produced, material, such, as, chemicals, pulp, and, paper, or, refined, oil, products, factories, manufacturing, chemicals, are, often, called, plants, and, may, have, most, of, their, equipment, tanks, pressure, vessels, chemical, reactors, pumps, and, piping, outdoors, and, operated, from, control, rooms, oil, refineries, have, most, of, their, equipment, outdoors, discrete, products, may, be, final, goods, or, parts, and, sub, assemblies, which, are, made, into, final, products, elsewhere, factories, may, be, supplied, parts, from, elsewhere, or, make, them, from, raw, materials, continuous, production, industries, typically, use, heat, or, electricity, to, transform, streams, of, raw, materials, into, finished, products, the, term, mill, originally, referred, to, the, milling, of, grain, which, usually, used, natural, resources, such, as, water, or, wind, power, until, those, were, displaced, by, steam, power, in, the, 19th, century, because, many, processes, like, spinning, and, weaving, iron, rolling, and, paper, manufacturing, were, originally, powered, by, water, the, term, survives, as, in, steel, mill, paper, mill, etc, max, weber, considered, production, during, ancient, and, medieval, times, as, never, warranting, classification, as, factories, with, methods, of, production, and, the, contemporary, economic, situation, incomparable, to, modern, or, even, pre, modern, developments, of, industry, in, ancient, times, the, earliest, production, limited, to, the, household, developed, into, a, separate, endeavor, independent, to, the, place, of, inhabitation, with, production, at, that, time, only, beginning, to, be, characteristic, of, industry, termed, as, unfree, shop, industry, a, situation, caused, especially, under, the, reign, of, the, egyptian, pharaoh, with, slave, employment, and, no, differentiation, of, skills, within, the, slave, group, comparable, to, modern, definitions, as, division, of, labour, according, to, translations, of, demosthenes, and, herodotus, naucratis, was, a, or, the, only, factory, in, the, entirety, of, ancient, egypt, a, source, of, 1983, hopkins, states, the, largest, factory, production, in, ancient, times, was, of, 120, slaves, within, fourth, century, bc, athens, an, article, within, the, new, york, times, article, dated, 13, october, 2011, states, in, african, cave, signs, of, an, ancient, paint, factory, john, noble, wilford, discovered, at, blombos, cave, a, cave, on, the, south, coast, of, south, africa, where, 100, 000, year, old, tools, and, ingredients, were, found, with, which, early, modern, humans, mixed, an, ochre, based, paint, although, the, cambridge, online, dictionary, definition, of, factory, states, a, building, or, set, of, buildings, where, large, amounts, of, goods, are, made, using, machines, elsewhere, the, utilization, of, machines, presupposes, social, cooperation, and, the, division, of, labour, the, first, machine, is, stated, by, one, source, to, have, been, traps, used, to, assist, with, the, capturing, of, animals, corresponding, to, the, machine, as, a, mechanism, operating, independently, or, with, very, little, force, by, interaction, from, a, human, with, a, capacity, for, use, repeatedly, with, operation, exactly, the, same, on, every, occasion, of, functioning, the, wheel, was, invented, c, 3000, bc, the, spoked, wheel, c, 2000, bc, the, iron, age, began, approximately, 1200, 1000, bc, however, other, sources, define, machinery, as, a, means, of, production, archaeology, provides, a, date, for, the, earliest, city, as, 5000, bc, as, tell, brak, ur, et, al, 2006, therefore, a, date, for, cooperation, and, factors, of, demand, by, an, increased, community, size, and, population, to, make, something, like, factory, level, production, a, conceivable, necessity, archaeologist, bonnet, unearthed, the, foundations, of, numerous, workshops, in, the, city, of, kerma, proving, that, as, early, as, 2000, bc, kerma, was, a, large, urban, capital, the, watermill, was, first, made, in, the, persian, empire, some, time, before, 350, bc, in, the, third, century, bc, philo, of, byzantium, describes, a, water, driven, wheel, in, his, technical, treatises, factories, producing, garum, were, common, in, the, roman, empire, the, barbegal, aqueduct, and, mills, are, an, industrial, complex, from, the, second, century, ad, found, in, southern, france, by, the, time, of, the, fourth, century, ad, there, was, a, water, milling, installation, with, a, capacity, to, grind, 28, tons, of, grain, per, day, a, rate, sufficient, to, meet, the, needs, of, 80, 000, persons, in, the, roman, empire, the, large, population, increase, in, medieval, islamic, cities, such, as, baghdad, s, 1, 5, million, population, led, to, the, development, of, large, scale, factory, milling, installations, with, higher, productivity, to, feed, and, support, the, large, growing, population, a, tenth, century, grain, processing, factory, in, the, egyptian, town, of, bilbays, for, example, milled, an, estimated, 300, tons, of, grain, and, flour, per, day, both, watermills, and, windmills, were, widely, used, in, the, islamic, world, at, the, time, the, venice, arsenal, also, provides, one, of, the, first, examples, of, a, factory, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, word, founded, in, 1104, in, venice, republic, of, venice, several, hundred, years, before, the, industrial, revolution, it, mass, produced, ships, on, assembly, lines, using, manufactured, parts, the, venice, arsenal, apparently, produced, nearly, one, ship, every, day, and, at, its, height, employed, 16, 000, people, one, of, the, earliest, factories, was, john, lombe, s, water, powered, silk, mill, at, derby, operational, by, 1721, by, 1746, an, integrated, brass, mill, was, working, at, warmley, near, bristol, raw, material, went, in, at, one, end, was, smelted, into, brass, and, was, turned, into, pans, pins, wire, and, other, goods, housing, was, provided, for, workers, on, site, josiah, wedgwood, in, staffordshire, and, matthew, boulton, at, his, soho, manufactory, were, other, prominent, early, industrialists, who, employed, the, factory, system, the, factory, system, began, widespread, use, somewhat, later, when, cotton, spinning, was, mechanized, richard, arkwright, is, the, person, credited, with, inventing, the, prototype, of, the, modern, factory, after, he, patented, his, water, frame, in, 1769, he, established, cromford, mill, in, derbyshire, england, significantly, expanding, the, village, of, cromford, to, accommodate, the, migrant, workers, new, to, the, area, the, factory, system, was, a, new, way, of, organizing, workforce, made, necessary, by, the, development, of, machines, which, were, too, large, to, house, in, a, worker, s, cottage, working, hours, were, as, long, as, they, had, been, for, the, farmer, that, is, from, dawn, to, dusk, six, days, per, week, overall, this, practice, essentially, reduced, skilled, and, unskilled, workers, to, replaceable, commodities, arkwright, s, factory, was, the, first, successful, cotton, spinning, factory, in, the, world, it, showed, unequivocally, the, way, ahead, for, industry, and, was, widely, copied, between, 1770, and, 1850, mechanized, factories, supplanted, traditional, artisan, shops, as, the, predominant, form, of, manufacturing, institution, because, the, larger, scale, factories, enjoyed, a, significant, technological, and, supervision, advantage, over, the, small, artisan, shops, the, earliest, factories, using, the, factory, system, developed, in, the, cotton, and, wool, textiles, industry, later, generations, of, factories, included, mechanized, shoe, production, and, manufacturing, of, machinery, including, machine, tools, after, this, came, factories, that, supplied, the, railroad, industry, included, rolling, mills, foundries, and, locomotive, works, along, with, agricultural, equipment, factories, that, produced, cast, steel, plows, and, reapers, bicycles, were, mass, produced, beginning, in, the, 1880s, the, nasmyth, gaskell, and, company, s, bridgewater, foundry, which, began, operation, in, 1836, was, one, of, the, earliest, factories, to, use, modern, materials, handling, such, as, cranes, and, rail, tracks, through, the, buildings, for, handling, heavy, items, large, scale, electrification, of, factories, began, around, 1900, after, the, development, of, the, ac, motor, which, was, able, to, run, at, constant, speed, depending, on, the, number, of, poles, and, the, current, electrical, frequency, at, first, larger, motors, were, added, to, line, shafts, but, as, soon, as, small, horsepower, motors, became, widely, available, factories, switched, to, unit, drive, eliminating, line, shafts, freed, factories, of, layout, constraints, and, allowed, factory, layout, to, be, more, efficient, electrification, enabled, sequential, automation, using, relay, logic, henry, ford, further, revolutionized, the, factory, concept, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, the, innovation, of, the, mass, production, highly, specialized, laborers, situated, alongside, a, series, of, rolling, ramps, would, build, up, a, product, such, as, in, ford, s, case, an, automobile, this, concept, dramatically, decreased, production, costs, for, virtually, all, manufactured, goods, and, brought, about, the, age, of, consumerism, in, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, industrialized, countries, introduced, next, generation, factories, with, two, improvements, some, speculation, as, to, the, future, of, the, factory, includes, scenarios, with, rapid, prototyping, nanotechnology, and, orbital, zero, gravity, facilities, there, is, some, scepticism, about, the, development, of, the, factories, of, the, future, if, the, robotic, industry, is, not, matched, by, a, higher, technological, level, of, the, people, who, operate, it, according, to, some, authors, the, four, basic, pillars, of, the, factories, of, the, future, are, strategy, technology, people, and, habitability, which, would, take, the, form, of, a, kind, of, laboratory, factories, with, management, models, that, allow, producing, with, quality, while, experimenting, to, do, it, better, tomorrow, before, the, advent, of, mass, transportation, factories, needs, for, ever, greater, concentrations, of, labourers, meant, that, they, typically, grew, up, in, an, urban, setting, or, fostered, their, own, urbanization, industrial, slums, developed, and, reinforced, their, own, development, through, the, interactions, between, factories, as, when, one, factory, s, output, or, waste, product, became, the, raw, materials, of, another, factory, preferably, nearby, canals, and, railways, grew, as, factories, spread, each, clustering, around, sources, of, cheap, energy, available, materials, and, or, mass, markets, the, exception, proved, the, rule, even, greenfield, factory, sites, such, as, bournville, founded, in, a, rural, setting, developed, their, own, housing, and, profited, from, convenient, communications, systems, regulation, curbed, some, of, the, worst, excesses, of, industrialization, s, factory, based, society, labourers, of, factory, acts, leading, the, way, in, britain, trams, automobiles, and, town, planning, encouraged, the, separate, development, of, industrial, suburbs, and, residential, suburbs, with, labourers, commuting, between, them, though, factories, dominated, the, industrial, era, the, growth, in, the, service, sector, eventually, began, to, dethrone, them, the, focus, of, labour, in, general, shifted, to, central, city, office, towers, or, to, semi, rural, campus, style, establishments, and, many, factories, stood, deserted, in, local, rust, belts, the, next, blow, to, the, traditional, factories, came, from, globalization, manufacturing, processes, or, their, logical, successors, assembly, plants, in, the, late, 20th, century, re, focussed, in, many, instances, on, special, economic, zones, in, developing, countries, or, on, maquiladoras, just, across, the, national, boundaries, of, industrialized, states, further, re, location, to, the, least, industrialized, nations, appears, possible, as, the, benefits, of, out, sourcing, and, the, lessons, of, flexible, location, apply, in, the, future, much, of, management, theory, developed, in, response, to, the, need, to, control, factory, processes, assumptions, on, the, hierarchies, of, unskilled, semi, skilled, and, skilled, laborers, and, their, supervisors, and, managers, still, linger, on, however, an, example, of, a, more, contemporary, approach, to, handle, design, applicable, to, manufacturing, facilities, can, be, found, in, socio, technical, systems, sts, in, britain, a, shadow, factory, is, one, of, a, number, of, manufacturing, sites, built, in, dispersed, locations, in, times, of, war, to, reduce, the, risk, of, disruption, due, to, enemy, air, raids, and, often, with, the, dual, purpose, of, increasing, manufacturing, capacity, before, world, war, ii, britain, had, built, many, shadow, factories, production, of, the, supermarine, spitfire, at, its, parent, company, s, base, at, woolston, southampton, was, vulnerable, to, enemy, attack, as, a, high, profile, target, and, was, well, within, range, of, luftwaffe, bombers, indeed, on, 26, september, 1940, this, facility, was, completely, destroyed, by, an, enemy, bombing, raid, supermarine, had, already, established, a, plant, at, castle, bromwich, this, action, prompted, them, to, further, disperse, spitfire, production, around, the, country, with, many, premises, being, requisitioned, by, the, british, government, connected, to, the, spitfire, was, production, of, its, equally, important, rolls, royce, merlin, engine, rolls, royce, s, main, aero, engine, facility, was, located, at, derby, the, need, for, increased, output, was, met, by, building, new, factories, in, crewe, and, glasgow, and, using, a, purpose, built, factory, of, ford, of, britain, in, trafford, park, manchester
