the, saturn, v, is, a, retired, american, super, heavy, lift, launch, vehicle, developed, by, nasa, under, the, apollo, program, for, human, exploration, of, the, moon, the, rocket, was, human, rated, had, three, stages, and, was, powered, by, liquid, fuel, flown, from, 1967, to, 1973, it, was, used, for, nine, crewed, flights, to, the, moon, and, to, launch, skylab, the, first, american, space, station, as, of, 2024, the, saturn, v, remains, the, only, launch, vehicle, to, have, carried, humans, beyond, low, earth, orbit, leo, the, saturn, v, holds, the, record, for, the, largest, payload, capacity, to, low, earth, orbit, 311, 152, lb, 141, 136, kg, which, included, unburned, propellant, needed, to, send, the, apollo, command, and, service, module, and, lunar, module, to, the, moon, the, largest, production, model, of, the, saturn, family, of, rockets, the, saturn, v, was, designed, under, the, direction, of, wernher, von, braun, at, the, marshall, space, flight, center, in, huntsville, alabama, the, lead, contractors, for, construction, of, the, rocket, were, boeing, north, american, aviation, douglas, aircraft, company, and, ibm, fifteen, flight, capable, vehicles, were, built, not, counting, three, used, for, ground, testing, a, total, of, thirteen, missions, were, launched, from, kennedy, space, center, nine, of, which, carried, 24, astronauts, to, the, moon, from, apollo, 8, december, 1968, to, apollo, 17, december, 1972, in, september, 1945, the, u, s, government, brought, the, german, rocket, technologist, wernher, von, braun, and, over, 1, 500, german, rocket, engineers, and, technicians, to, the, united, states, in, operation, paperclip, a, program, authorized, by, president, truman, von, braun, who, had, helped, create, the, german, v, 2, rocket, was, assigned, to, the, army, s, rocket, design, division, between, 1945, and, 1958, his, work, was, restricted, to, conveying, the, ideas, and, methods, behind, the, v, 2, to, american, engineers, though, he, wrote, books, and, articles, in, popular, magazines, this, approach, changed, in, 1957, when, the, soviets, launched, sputnik, 1, atop, an, r, 7, icbm, which, could, carry, a, thermonuclear, warhead, to, the, u, s, the, army, and, government, began, putting, more, effort, towards, sending, americans, into, space, before, the, soviets, they, turned, to, von, braun, s, team, who, had, created, the, jupiter, series, of, rockets, the, juno, i, rocket, launched, the, first, american, satellite, in, january, 1958, von, braun, considered, the, jupiter, series, of, rockets, to, be, a, prototype, of, the, upcoming, saturn, series, of, rockets, and, referred, to, it, as, an, infant, saturn, named, after, the, sixth, planet, from, the, sun, the, design, of, the, various, saturn, rockets, evolved, from, the, jupiter, vehicles, between, 1960, and, 1962, the, marshall, space, flight, center, msfc, designed, a, series, of, saturn, rockets, that, could, be, deployed, for, earth, orbit, and, lunar, missions, nasa, planned, to, use, the, saturn, c, 3, as, part, of, the, earth, orbit, rendezvous, eor, method, for, a, lunar, mission, with, at, least, two, or, three, launches, needed, for, a, single, landing, on, the, moon, however, the, msfc, planned, an, even, bigger, rocket, the, c, 4, which, would, use, four, f, 1, engines, in, its, first, stage, an, enlarged, c, 3, second, stage, and, the, s, ivb, a, stage, with, a, single, j, 2, engine, as, its, third, stage, the, c, 4, would, only, need, to, carry, out, two, launches, to, carry, out, an, eor, lunar, mission, on, january, 10, 1962, nasa, announced, plans, to, build, the, c, 5, the, three, stage, rocket, would, consist, of, the, s, ic, first, stage, with, five, f, 1, engines, the, s, ii, second, stage, with, five, j, 2, engines, and, the, s, ivb, third, stage, with, a, single, j, 2, engine, the, c, 5, would, undergo, component, testing, even, before, the, first, model, was, constructed, the, s, ivb, third, stage, would, be, used, as, the, second, stage, for, the, c, 1b, which, would, serve, both, to, demonstrate, proof, of, concept, and, feasibility, for, the, c, 5, but, would, also, provide, flight, data, critical, to, the, development, of, the, c, 5, rather, than, undergoing, testing, for, each, major, component, the, c, 5, would, be, tested, in, an, all, up, fashion, meaning, that, the, first, test, flight, of, the, rocket, would, include, complete, versions, of, all, three, stages, by, testing, all, components, at, once, far, fewer, test, flights, would, be, required, before, a, crewed, launch, the, c, 5, was, confirmed, as, nasa, s, choice, for, the, apollo, program, in, early, 1962, and, was, named, the, saturn, v, the, c, 1, became, the, saturn, i, and, c, 1b, became, saturn, ib, von, braun, headed, a, team, at, the, msfc, to, build, a, vehicle, capable, of, launching, a, crewed, spacecraft, to, the, moon, during, these, revisions, the, team, rejected, the, single, engine, of, the, v, 2, s, design, and, moved, to, a, multiple, engine, design, the, saturn, v, s, final, design, had, several, key, features, f, 1, engines, were, chosen, for, the, first, stage, while, new, liquid, hydrogen, propulsion, system, called, j, 2, for, the, second, and, third, stage, nasa, had, finalized, its, plans, to, proceed, with, von, braun, s, saturn, designs, and, the, apollo, space, program, gained, speed, the, stages, were, designed, by, von, braun, s, marshall, space, flight, center, in, huntsville, and, outside, contractors, were, chosen, for, the, construction, boeing, s, ic, north, american, aviation, s, ii, douglas, aircraft, s, ivb, and, ibm, instrument, unit, early, in, the, planning, process, nasa, considered, three, methods, for, the, moon, mission, earth, orbit, rendezvous, eor, direct, ascent, and, lunar, orbit, rendezvous, lor, a, direct, ascent, configuration, would, require, an, extremely, large, rocket, to, send, a, three, man, spacecraft, to, land, directly, on, the, lunar, surface, an, eor, would, launch, the, direct, landing, spacecraft, in, two, smaller, parts, which, would, combine, in, earth, orbit, a, lor, mission, would, involve, a, single, rocket, launching, two, spacecraft, a, mother, ship, and, a, smaller, two, man, landing, module, which, would, rendezvous, back, with, the, main, spacecraft, in, lunar, orbit, the, lander, would, be, discarded, and, the, mother, ship, would, return, home, at, first, nasa, dismissed, lor, as, a, riskier, option, as, a, space, rendezvous, had, yet, to, be, performed, in, earth, orbit, much, less, in, lunar, orbit, several, nasa, officials, including, langley, research, center, engineer, john, houbolt, and, nasa, administrator, george, low, argued, that, a, lunar, orbit, rendezvous, provided, the, simplest, landing, on, the, moon, with, the, most, cost, efficient, launch, vehicle, and, the, best, chance, to, accomplish, the, lunar, landing, within, the, decade, other, nasa, officials, became, convinced, and, lor, was, then, officially, selected, as, the, mission, configuration, for, the, apollo, program, and, announced, by, nasa, administrator, james, e, webb, on, november, 7, 1962, arthur, rudolph, became, the, project, director, of, the, saturn, v, rocket, program, in, august, 1963, he, developed, the, requirements, for, the, rocket, system, and, the, mission, plan, for, the, apollo, program, the, first, saturn, v, launch, lifted, off, from, kennedy, space, center, and, performed, flawlessly, on, november, 9, 1967, rudolph, s, birthday, he, was, then, assigned, as, the, special, assistant, to, the, director, of, msfc, in, may, 1968, and, subsequently, retired, from, nasa, on, january, 1, 1969, on, july, 16, 1969, the, saturn, v, launched, apollo, 11, putting, the, first, men, on, the, moon, the, size, and, payload, capacity, of, the, saturn, v, dwarfed, those, of, all, other, previous, rockets, successfully, flown, at, that, time, with, the, apollo, spacecraft, on, top, it, stood, 363, feet, 111, m, tall, and, ignoring, the, fins, was, 33, feet, 10, m, in, diameter, fully, fueled, the, saturn, v, weighed, 6, 5, million, pounds, 2, 900, 000, kg, and, had, a, low, earth, orbit, leo, payload, capacity, originally, estimated, at, 261, 000, pounds, 118, 000, kg, but, was, designed, to, send, at, least, 90, 000, pounds, 41, 000, kg, to, the, moon, later, upgrades, increased, that, capacity, on, the, final, three, apollo, lunar, missions, it, sent, up, to, 95, 901, lb, 43, 500, kg, to, the, moon, at, a, height, of, 363, feet, 111, m, the, saturn, v, stood, 58, feet, 18, m, taller, than, the, statue, of, liberty, from, the, ground, to, the, torch, and, 48, feet, 15, m, taller, than, the, elizabeth, tower, which, houses, big, ben, at, the, palace, of, westminster, in, contrast, the, mercury, redstone, launch, vehicle, used, on, freedom, 7, the, first, crewed, american, spaceflight, was, approximately, 11, feet, 3, 4, m, longer, than, the, s, ivb, stage, and, delivered, less, sea, level, thrust, 78, 000, pounds, force, 350, kn, than, the, launch, escape, system, rocket, 150, 000, pounds, force, 667, kn, sea, level, thrust, mounted, atop, the, apollo, command, module, the, apollo, les, fired, for, a, much, shorter, time, than, the, mercury, redstone, 3, 2, seconds, vs, 143, 5, seconds, the, saturn, v, was, principally, designed, by, the, marshall, space, flight, center, in, huntsville, alabama, although, numerous, major, systems, including, propulsion, systems, were, designed, by, subcontractors, the, rocket, used, the, powerful, f, 1, and, j, 2, rocket, engines, during, testing, at, stennis, space, center, the, force, developed, by, the, engines, shattered, the, windows, of, nearby, houses, designers, decided, early, on, to, attempt, to, use, as, much, technology, from, the, saturn, i, program, as, possible, for, the, saturn, v, consequently, the, s, ivb, 500, third, stage, of, the, saturn, v, was, based, on, the, s, ivb, 200, second, stage, of, the, saturn, ib, the, instrument, unit, that, controlled, the, saturn, v, shared, characteristics, with, the, one, carried, by, the, saturn, ib, the, saturn, v, was, primarily, constructed, of, aluminum, it, was, also, made, of, titanium, polyurethane, cork, and, asbestos, blueprints, and, other, plans, of, the, rocket, are, available, on, microfilm, at, the, marshall, space, flight, center, the, saturn, v, consisted, of, three, stages, the, s, ic, first, stage, s, ii, second, stage, and, s, ivb, third, stage, and, the, instrument, unit, all, three, stages, used, liquid, oxygen, lox, as, the, oxidizer, the, first, stage, used, rp, 1, for, fuel, while, the, second, and, third, stages, used, liquid, hydrogen, lh2, lh2, has, a, higher, specific, energy, energy, per, unit, mass, than, rp, 1, which, makes, it, more, suitable, for, higher, energy, orbits, such, as, the, trans, lunar, injection, required, for, apollo, missions, conversely, rp, 1, offers, higher, energy, density, energy, per, unit, volume, and, higher, thrust, than, lh2, which, makes, it, more, suitable, for, reducing, aerodynamic, drag, and, gravity, losses, in, the, early, stages, of, launch, if, the, first, stage, had, used, lh2, the, volume, required, would, have, been, more, than, three, times, greater, which, would, have, been, aerodynamically, infeasible, at, the, time, the, upper, stages, also, used, small, solid, propellant, ullage, motors, that, helped, to, separate, the, stages, during, the, launch, and, to, ensure, that, the, liquid, propellants, were, in, a, proper, position, to, be, drawn, into, the, pumps, the, s, ic, was, built, by, the, boeing, company, at, the, michoud, assembly, facility, new, orleans, where, the, space, shuttle, external, tanks, would, later, be, built, by, lockheed, martin, most, of, its, mass, at, launch, was, propellant, rp, 1, fuel, with, liquid, oxygen, as, the, oxidizer, the, stage, was, 138, feet, 42, m, tall, and, 33, feet, 10, m, in, diameter, it, provided, 7, 750, 000, lbf, 34, 500, kn, of, thrust, at, sea, level, the, s, ic, stage, had, a, dry, mass, of, about, 303, 000, pounds, 137, 000, kilograms, when, fully, fueled, at, launch, it, had, a, total, mass, of, 4, 881, 000, pounds, 2, 214, 000, kilograms, the, s, ic, was, powered, by, five, rocketdyne, f, 1, engines, arrayed, in, a, quincunx, the, center, engine, was, held, in, a, fixed, position, while, the, four, outer, engines, could, be, hydraulically, turned, with, gimbals, to, steer, the, rocket, in, flight, the, center, engine, was, turned, off, about, 26, seconds, earlier, than, the, outboard, engines, to, limit, acceleration, during, launch, the, s, ic, fired, its, engines, for, 168, seconds, ignition, occurred, about, 8, 9, seconds, before, liftoff, and, at, engine, cutoff, the, vehicle, was, at, an, altitude, of, about, 42, miles, 67, km, was, downrange, about, 58, miles, 93, km, and, was, moving, around, 7, 500, feet, per, second, 2, 300, m, s, while, not, put, into, production, a, proposed, replacement, for, the, first, stage, was, the, aj, 260x, this, solid, rocket, motor, would, have, simplified, the, design, by, removing, the, five, engine, configuration, and, in, turn, reduced, launch, costs, the, s, ii, was, built, by, north, american, aviation, at, seal, beach, california, using, liquid, hydrogen, and, liquid, oxygen, it, had, five, rocketdyne, j, 2, engines, in, a, similar, arrangement, to, the, s, ic, and, also, used, the, four, outer, engines, for, control, the, s, ii, was, 81, 6, feet, 24, 87, m, tall, with, a, diameter, of, 33, feet, 10, m, identical, to, the, s, ic, and, thus, was, the, largest, cryogenic, stage, until, the, launch, of, the, space, shuttle, in, 1981, the, s, ii, had, a, dry, mass, of, about, 80, 000, pounds, 36, 000, kg, when, fully, fueled, it, weighed, 1, 060, 000, pounds, 480, 000, kg, the, second, stage, accelerated, the, saturn, v, through, the, upper, atmosphere, with, 1, 100, 000, pounds, force, 4, 900, kn, of, thrust, in, a, vacuum, when, loaded, with, fuel, more, than, 90, percent, of, the, mass, of, the, stage, was, propellant, however, the, ultra, lightweight, design, had, led, to, two, failures, in, structural, testing, instead, of, having, an, intertank, structure, to, separate, the, two, fuel, tanks, as, was, done, in, the, s, ic, the, s, ii, used, a, common, bulkhead, that, was, constructed, from, both, the, top, of, the, lox, tank, and, bottom, of, the, lh2, tank, it, consisted, of, two, aluminum, sheets, separated, by, a, honeycomb, structure, made, of, phenolic, resin, this, bulkhead, had, to, be, able, to, insulate, against, the, 126, f, 70, c, temperature, difference, between, the, two, tanks, the, use, of, a, common, bulkhead, saved, 7, 900, pounds, 3, 6, t, by, both, eliminating, one, bulkhead, and, reducing, the, stage, s, length, like, the, s, ic, the, s, ii, was, transported, from, its, manufacturing, plant, to, cape, kennedy, by, sea, the, s, ivb, stage, was, built, by, the, douglas, aircraft, company, at, huntington, beach, california, it, had, one, rocketdyne, j, 2, engine, and, used, the, same, fuel, as, the, s, ii, the, s, ivb, used, a, common, bulkhead, to, separate, the, two, tanks, it, was, 58, 6, feet, 17, 86, m, tall, with, a, diameter, of, 21, 7, feet, 6, 604, m, and, was, also, designed, with, high, mass, efficiency, though, not, quite, as, aggressively, as, the, s, ii, the, s, ivb, had, a, dry, mass, of, about, 23, 000, pounds, 10, 000, kg, and, when, fully, fueled, weighed, about, 262, 000, pounds, 119, 000, kg, the, s, ivb, was, the, only, rocket, stage, of, the, saturn, v, small, enough, to, be, transported, by, the, cargo, plane, aero, spacelines, pregnant, guppy, for, lunar, missions, it, was, fired, twice, first, for, earth, orbit, insertion, after, second, stage, cutoff, and, a, second, time, for, translunar, injection, tli, the, saturn, v, s, instrument, unit, was, built, by, ibm, and, was, placed, on, top, of, the, rocket, s, third, stage, it, was, constructed, at, the, space, systems, center, in, huntsville, alabama, this, computer, controlled, the, operations, of, the, rocket, from, just, before, liftoff, until, the, s, ivb, was, discarded, it, included, guidance, and, telemetry, systems, for, the, rocket, by, measuring, the, acceleration, and, vehicle, attitude, it, could, calculate, the, position, and, velocity, of, the, rocket, and, correct, for, any, deviations, after, the, construction, and, ground, testing, of, each, stage, was, completed, they, were, each, shipped, to, the, kennedy, space, center, the, first, two, stages, were, so, massive, that, the, only, way, to, transport, them, was, by, barge, the, s, ic, constructed, in, new, orleans, was, transported, down, the, mississippi, river, to, the, gulf, of, mexico, after, rounding, florida, the, stages, were, transported, up, the, intra, coastal, waterway, to, the, vehicle, assembly, building, originally, called, the, vertical, assembly, building, this, was, essentially, the, same, route, which, would, be, used, later, to, ship, space, shuttle, external, tanks, the, s, ii, was, constructed, in, california, and, traveled, to, florida, via, the, panama, canal, the, third, stage, and, instrument, unit, was, carried, by, the, aero, spacelines, pregnant, guppy, and, super, guppy, but, could, also, have, been, carried, by, barge, if, warranted, upon, arrival, at, the, vertical, assembly, building, each, stage, was, inspected, in, a, horizontal, position, before, being, oriented, vertically, nasa, also, constructed, large, spool, shaped, structures, that, could, be, used, in, place, of, stages, if, a, particular, stage, was, delayed, these, spools, had, the, same, height, and, mass, and, contained, the, same, electrical, connections, as, the, actual, stages, nasa, stacked, assembled, the, saturn, v, on, a, mobile, launcher, which, consisted, of, a, launch, umbilical, tower, with, nine, swing, arms, including, the, crew, access, arm, a, hammerhead, crane, and, a, water, suppression, system, which, was, activated, prior, to, engine, ignition, during, a, launch, after, assembly, was, completed, the, entire, stack, was, moved, from, the, vehicle, assembly, building, vab, to, the, launch, pad, using, the, crawler, transporter, ct, built, by, the, marion, power, shovel, company, and, later, used, for, transporting, the, smaller, and, lighter, space, shuttle, as, well, as, the, space, launch, system, the, ct, ran, on, four, double, tracked, treads, each, with, 57, shoes, each, shoe, weighed, 2, 000, pounds, 910, kg, this, transporter, was, also, required, to, keep, the, rocket, level, as, it, traveled, the, 3, miles, 4, 8, km, to, the, launch, site, especially, at, the, 3, percent, grade, encountered, at, the, launch, pad, the, ct, also, carried, the, mobile, service, structure, mss, which, allowed, technicians, access, to, the, rocket, until, eight, hours, before, launch, when, it, was, moved, to, the, halfway, point, on, the, crawlerway, the, junction, between, the, vab, and, the, two, launch, pads, from, 1964, until, 1973, 6, 417, billion, equivalent, to, 40, 9, billion, in, 2023, was, appropriated, for, the, research, and, development, and, flights, of, the, saturn, v, with, the, maximum, being, in, 1966, with, 1, 2, billion, equivalent, to, 8, 61, billion, in, 2023, that, same, year, nasa, received, its, largest, total, budget, of, 4, 5, billion, about, 0, 5, percent, of, the, gross, domestic, product, gdp, of, the, united, states, at, that, time, two, main, reasons, for, the, cancellation, of, the, last, three, apollo, missions, were, the, heavy, investments, in, saturn, v, and, the, ever, increasing, costs, of, the, vietnam, war, to, the, u, s, in, money, and, resources, in, the, time, frame, from, 1969, to, 1971, the, cost, of, launching, a, saturn, v, apollo, mission, was, between, 185, 000, 000, to, 189, 000, 000, of, which, 110, million, were, used, for, the, production, of, the, vehicle, equivalent, to, 1, 18, billion, 1, 2, billion, in, 2023, the, saturn, v, carried, all, apollo, lunar, missions, which, were, launched, from, launch, complex, 39, at, the, john, f, kennedy, space, center, in, florida, after, the, rocket, cleared, the, launch, tower, flight, control, transferred, to, mission, control, at, the, johnson, space, center, in, houston, texas, an, average, mission, used, the, rocket, for, a, total, of, just, 20, minutes, although, apollo, 6, experienced, three, engine, failures, and, apollo, 13, experienced, one, engine, shutdown, the, onboard, computers, were, able, to, compensate, by, burning, the, remaining, engines, longer, to, achieve, parking, orbit, in, the, event, of, an, abort, requiring, the, destruction, of, the, rocket, the, range, safety, officer, would, remotely, shut, down, the, engines, and, after, several, seconds, send, another, command, for, the, shaped, explosive, charges, attached, to, the, outer, surfaces, of, the, rocket, to, detonate, these, would, make, cuts, in, fuel, and, oxidizer, tanks, to, disperse, the, fuel, quickly, and, to, minimize, mixing, the, pause, between, these, two, actions, would, give, time, for, the, crew, to, escape, via, the, launch, escape, tower, or, in, the, later, stages, of, the, flight, the, propulsion, system, of, the, service, module, a, third, command, safe, was, used, after, the, s, ivb, stage, reached, orbit, to, irreversibly, deactivate, the, self, destruct, system, the, system, was, also, held, inactive, as, long, as, the, rocket, was, still, on, the, launch, pad, the, first, stage, burned, for, about, 2, minutes, and, 41, seconds, lifting, the, rocket, to, an, altitude, of, 42, miles, 68, km, and, a, speed, of, 6, 164, miles, per, hour, 2, 756, m, s, and, burning, 4, 700, 000, pounds, 2, 100, 000, kg, of, propellant, at, 8, 9, seconds, before, launch, the, first, stage, ignition, sequence, started, the, center, engine, ignited, first, followed, by, opposing, outboard, pairs, at, 300, millisecond, intervals, to, reduce, the, structural, loads, on, the, rocket, when, thrust, had, been, confirmed, by, the, onboard, computers, the, rocket, was, soft, released, in, two, stages, first, the, hold, down, arms, released, the, rocket, and, second, as, the, rocket, began, to, accelerate, upwards, it, was, slowed, by, tapered, metal, pins, pulled, through, holes, for, half, a, second, once, the, rocket, had, lifted, off, it, could, not, safely, settle, back, down, onto, the, pad, if, the, engines, failed, the, astronauts, considered, this, one, of, the, tensest, moments, in, riding, the, saturn, v, for, if, the, rocket, did, fail, to, lift, off, after, release, they, had, a, low, chance, of, survival, given, the, large, amounts, of, propellant, to, improve, safety, the, saturn, emergency, detection, system, eds, inhibited, engine, shutdown, for, the, first, 30, seconds, of, flight, if, all, three, stages, were, to, explode, simultaneously, on, the, launch, pad, an, unlikely, event, the, saturn, v, had, a, total, explosive, yield, of, 543, tons, of, tnt, or, 0, 543, kilotons, 2, 271, 912, 000, 000, j, or, 155, 143, lbs, of, weight, loss, which, is, 0, 222, kt, for, the, first, stage, 0, 263, kt, for, the, second, stage, and, 0, 068, kt, for, the, third, stage, see, saturn, v, instrument, unit, contrary, to, popular, myth, the, noise, produced, was, not, able, to, melt, concrete, it, took, about, 12, seconds, for, the, rocket, to, clear, the, tower, during, this, time, it, yawed, 1, 25, degrees, away, from, the, tower, to, ensure, adequate, clearance, despite, adverse, winds, this, yaw, although, small, can, be, seen, in, launch, photos, taken, from, the, east, or, west, at, an, altitude, of, 430, feet, 130, m, the, rocket, rolled, to, the, correct, flight, azimuth, and, then, gradually, pitched, down, until, 38, seconds, after, second, stage, ignition, this, pitch, program, was, set, according, to, the, prevailing, winds, during, the, launch, month, the, four, outboard, engines, also, tilted, toward, the, outside, so, that, in, the, event, of, a, premature, outboard, engine, shutdown, the, remaining, engines, would, thrust, through, the, rocket, s, center, of, mass, the, saturn, v, reached, 400, feet, per, second, 120, m, s, at, over, 1, mile, 1, 600, m, in, altitude, much, of, the, early, portion, of, the, flight, was, spent, gaining, altitude, with, the, required, velocity, coming, later, the, saturn, v, broke, the, sound, barrier, at, just, over, 1, minute, at, an, altitude, of, between, 3, 45, and, 4, 6, miles, 5, 55, and, 7, 40, km, at, this, point, shock, collars, or, condensation, clouds, would, form, around, the, bottom, of, the, command, module, and, around, the, top, of, the, second, stage, at, about, 80, seconds, the, rocket, experienced, maximum, dynamic, pressure, max, q, the, dynamic, pressure, on, a, rocket, varies, with, air, density, and, the, square, of, relative, velocity, although, velocity, continues, to, increase, air, density, decreases, so, quickly, with, altitude, that, dynamic, pressure, falls, below, max, q, the, propellant, in, just, the, s, ic, made, up, about, three, quarters, of, saturn, v, s, entire, launch, mass, and, it, was, consumed, at, 13, 000, kilograms, per, second, 1, 700, 000, lb, min, newton, s, second, law, of, motion, states, that, force, is, equal, to, mass, multiplied, by, acceleration, or, equivalently, that, acceleration, is, equal, to, force, divided, by, mass, so, as, the, mass, decreased, and, the, force, increased, somewhat, acceleration, rose, including, gravity, launch, acceleration, was, only, 1, 1, 4, g, i, e, the, astronauts, felt, 1, 1, 4, g, while, the, rocket, accelerated, vertically, at, 1, 4, g, as, the, rocket, rapidly, lost, mass, total, acceleration, including, gravity, increased, to, nearly, 4, g, at, t, 135, seconds, at, this, point, the, inboard, center, engine, was, shut, down, to, prevent, acceleration, from, increasing, beyond, 4, g, when, oxidizer, or, fuel, depletion, was, sensed, in, the, suction, assemblies, the, remaining, four, outboard, engines, were, shut, down, first, stage, separation, occurred, a, little, less, than, one, second, after, this, to, allow, for, f, 1, thrust, tail, off, eight, small, solid, fuel, separation, motors, backed, the, s, ic, from, the, rest, of, the, vehicle, at, an, altitude, of, about, 42, miles, 67, km, the, first, stage, continued, on, a, ballistic, trajectory, to, an, altitude, of, about, 68, miles, 109, km, and, then, fell, in, the, atlantic, ocean, about, 350, miles, 560, km, downrange, the, engine, shutdown, procedure, was, changed, for, the, launch, of, skylab, to, avoid, damage, to, the, apollo, telescope, mount, rather, than, shutting, down, all, four, outboard, engines, at, once, they, were, shut, down, two, at, a, time, with, a, delay, to, reduce, peak, acceleration, further, after, s, ic, separation, the, s, ii, second, stage, burned, for, 6, minutes, and, propelled, the, craft, to, 109, miles, 175, km, and, 15, 647, mph, 25, 181, km, h, close, to, orbital, velocity, for, the, first, two, uncrewed, launches, eight, solid, fuel, ullage, motors, ignited, for, four, seconds, to, accelerate, the, s, ii, stage, followed, by, the, ignition, of, the, five, j, 2, engines, for, the, first, seven, crewed, apollo, missions, only, four, ullage, motors, were, used, on, the, s, ii, and, they, were, eliminated, for, the, final, four, launches, about, 30, seconds, after, first, stage, separation, the, interstage, ring, dropped, from, the, second, stage, this, was, done, with, an, inertially, fixed, attitude, orientation, around, its, center, of, gravity, so, that, the, interstage, only, 3, feet, 3, inches, 1, m, from, the, outboard, j, 2, engines, would, fall, cleanly, without, hitting, them, as, the, interstage, could, have, potentially, damaged, two, of, the, j, 2, engines, if, it, was, attached, to, the, s, ic, shortly, after, interstage, separation, the, launch, escape, system, was, also, jettisoned, about, 38, seconds, after, the, second, stage, ignition, the, saturn, v, switched, from, a, preprogrammed, trajectory, to, a, closed, loop, or, iterative, guidance, mode, the, instrument, unit, now, computed, in, real, time, the, most, fuel, efficient, trajectory, toward, its, target, orbit, if, the, instrument, unit, failed, the, crew, could, switch, control, of, the, saturn, to, the, command, module, s, computer, take, manual, control, or, abort, the, flight, about, 90, seconds, before, the, second, stage, cutoff, the, center, engine, shut, down, to, reduce, longitudinal, pogo, oscillations, at, around, this, time, the, lox, flow, rate, decreased, changing, the, mix, ratio, of, the, two, propellants, and, ensuring, that, there, would, be, as, little, propellant, as, possible, left, in, the, tanks, at, the, end, of, second, stage, flight, this, was, done, at, a, predetermined, delta, v, five, level, sensors, in, the, bottom, of, each, s, ii, propellant, tank, were, armed, during, s, ii, flight, allowing, any, two, to, trigger, s, ii, cutoff, and, staging, when, they, were, uncovered, one, second, after, the, second, stage, cut, off, it, separated, and, several, seconds, later, the, third, stage, ignited, solid, fuel, retro, rockets, mounted, on, the, interstage, at, the, top, of, the, s, ii, fired, to, back, it, away, from, the, s, ivb, the, s, ii, impacted, about, 2, 600, miles, 4, 200, km, from, the, launch, site, on, the, apollo, 13, mission, the, inboard, engine, suffered, major, pogo, oscillation, resulting, in, an, early, automatic, cutoff, to, ensure, sufficient, velocity, was, reached, the, remaining, four, engines, were, kept, active, for, longer, than, planned, a, pogo, suppressor, was, fitted, to, later, apollo, missions, to, avoid, this, though, the, early, fifth, engine, s, cutoff, remained, to, reduce, g, forces, unlike, the, two, plane, separation, of, the, s, ic, and, s, ii, the, s, ii, and, s, ivb, stages, separated, with, a, single, step, although, it, was, constructed, as, part, of, the, third, stage, the, interstage, remained, attached, to, the, second, stage, the, third, stage, did, not, use, much, fuel, to, get, into, leo, low, earth, orbit, because, the, second, stage, had, done, most, of, the, job, during, apollo, 11, a, typical, lunar, mission, the, third, stage, burned, for, about, 2, 5, minutes, until, first, cutoff, at, 11, minutes, 40, seconds, at, this, point, it, was, 1, 645, 61, miles, 2, 648, 35, km, downrange, and, in, a, parking, orbit, at, an, altitude, of, 118, miles, 190, km, and, velocity, of, 17, 432, miles, per, hour, 28, 054, km, h, the, third, stage, remained, attached, to, the, spacecraft, while, it, orbited, the, earth, one, and, a, half, times, while, astronauts, and, mission, controllers, prepared, for, translunar, injection, tli, for, the, final, three, apollo, flights, the, temporary, parking, orbit, was, even, lower, approximately, 107, miles, or, 172, kilometers, to, increase, payload, for, these, missions, the, apollo, 9, earth, orbit, mission, was, launched, into, the, nominal, orbit, consistent, with, apollo, 11, but, the, spacecraft, were, able, to, use, their, own, engines, to, raise, the, perigee, high, enough, to, sustain, the, 10, day, mission, skylab, was, launched, into, a, quite, different, orbit, with, a, 270, mile, 434, km, perigee, which, sustained, it, for, six, years, and, also, a, higher, inclination, to, the, equator, 50, degrees, versus, 32, 5, degrees, for, apollo, on, apollo, 11, tli, came, at, 2, hours, and, 44, minutes, after, launch, the, s, ivb, burned, for, almost, six, minutes, giving, the, spacecraft, a, velocity, close, to, the, earth, s, escape, velocity, of, 25, 053, mph, 40, 319, km, h, this, gave, an, energy, efficient, transfer, to, lunar, orbit, with, the, moon, helping, to, capture, the, spacecraft, with, a, minimum, of, csm, fuel, consumption, about, 40, minutes, after, tli, the, apollo, command, and, service, module, csm, separated, from, the, third, stage, turned, 180, degrees, and, docked, with, the, lunar, module, lm, that, rode, below, the, csm, during, launch, the, csm, and, lm, separated, from, the, spent, third, stage, 50, minutes, later, in, a, maneuver, known, as, transposition, docking, and, extraction, if, it, were, to, remain, on, the, same, trajectory, as, the, spacecraft, the, s, ivb, could, have, presented, a, collision, hazard, so, its, remaining, propellants, were, vented, and, the, auxiliary, propulsion, system, fired, to, move, it, away, for, lunar, missions, before, apollo, 13, the, s, ivb, was, directed, toward, the, moon, s, trailing, edge, in, its, orbit, so, that, the, moon, would, slingshot, it, beyond, earth, escape, velocity, and, into, solar, orbit, from, apollo, 13, onwards, controllers, directed, the, s, ivb, to, hit, the, moon, seismometers, left, behind, by, previous, missions, detected, the, impacts, and, the, information, helped, map, the, internal, structure, of, the, moon, in, 1965, the, apollo, applications, program, aap, was, created, to, look, into, science, missions, that, could, be, performed, using, apollo, hardware, much, of, the, planning, centered, on, the, idea, of, a, space, station, wernher, von, braun, s, earlier, 1964, plans, employed, a, wet, workshop, concept, with, a, spent, s, ii, saturn, v, second, stage, being, launched, into, orbit, and, outfitted, in, space, the, next, year, aap, studied, a, smaller, station, using, the, saturn, ib, second, stage, by, 1969, apollo, funding, cuts, eliminated, the, possibility, of, procuring, more, apollo, hardware, and, forced, the, cancellation, of, some, later, moon, landing, flights, this, freed, up, at, least, one, saturn, v, allowing, the, wet, workshop, to, be, replaced, with, the, dry, workshop, concept, the, station, now, known, as, skylab, would, be, built, on, the, ground, from, a, surplus, saturn, ib, second, stage, and, launched, atop, the, first, two, live, stages, of, a, saturn, v, a, backup, station, constructed, from, a, saturn, v, third, stage, was, built, and, is, now, on, display, at, the, national, air, and, space, museum, skylab, was, the, only, launch, not, directly, related, to, the, apollo, lunar, landing, program, the, only, significant, changes, to, the, saturn, v, from, the, apollo, configurations, involved, some, modification, to, the, s, ii, to, act, as, the, terminal, stage, for, inserting, the, skylab, payload, into, earth, orbit, and, to, vent, excess, propellant, after, engine, cutoff, so, the, spent, stage, would, not, rupture, in, orbit, the, s, ii, remained, in, orbit, for, almost, two, years, and, made, an, uncontrolled, re, entry, on, january, 11, 1975, three, crews, lived, aboard, skylab, from, may, 25, 1973, to, february, 8, 1974, skylab, remained, in, orbit, until, july, 11, 1979, after, apollo, the, saturn, v, was, planned, to, be, the, prime, launch, vehicle, for, prospector, to, be, launched, to, the, moon, prospector, was, a, proposed, 330, kilogram, 730, lb, robotic, rover, similar, to, the, two, soviet, lunokhod, rovers, the, voyager, mars, probes, and, a, scaled, up, version, of, the, voyager, interplanetary, probes, saturn, v, was, also, to, have, been, the, launch, vehicle, for, the, nuclear, rocket, stage, rift, test, program, and, for, some, versions, of, the, upcoming, nerva, project, all, of, these, planned, uses, of, the, saturn, v, were, cancelled, with, cost, being, a, major, factor, edgar, cortright, who, had, been, the, director, of, nasa, langley, stated, decades, later, that, jpl, never, liked, the, big, approach, they, always, argued, against, it, i, probably, was, the, leading, proponent, in, using, the, saturn, v, and, i, lost, probably, very, wise, that, i, lost, the, canceled, second, production, run, of, saturn, vs, would, very, likely, have, used, the, f, 1a, engine, in, its, first, stage, providing, a, substantial, performance, boost, other, likely, changes, would, have, been, the, removal, of, the, fins, which, turned, out, to, provide, little, benefit, when, compared, to, their, weight, a, stretched, s, ic, first, stage, to, support, the, more, powerful, f, 1as, and, uprated, j, 2s, or, an, m, 1, for, the, upper, stages, a, number, of, alternate, saturn, vehicles, were, proposed, based, on, the, saturn, v, ranging, from, the, saturn, int, 20, with, an, s, ivb, stage, and, interstage, mounted, directly, onto, an, s, ic, stage, through, to, the, saturn, v, 23, l, which, would, not, only, have, five, f, 1, engines, in, the, first, stage, but, also, four, strap, on, boosters, with, two, f, 1, engines, each, giving, a, total, of, thirteen, f, 1, engines, firing, at, launch, lack, of, a, second, saturn, v, production, run, killed, these, plans, and, left, the, united, states, without, a, super, heavy, lift, launch, vehicle, some, in, the, u, s, space, community, came, to, lament, this, situation, as, continued, production, could, have, allowed, the, international, space, station, using, a, skylab, or, mir, configuration, with, both, u, s, and, russian, docking, ports, to, be, lifted, with, just, a, handful, of, launches, the, saturn, shuttle, concept, also, could, have, eliminated, the, space, shuttle, solid, rocket, boosters, that, ultimately, precipitated, the, challenger, accident, in, 1986, u, s, proposals, for, a, rocket, larger, than, the, saturn, v, from, the, late, 1950s, through, the, early, 1980s, were, generally, called, nova, over, thirty, different, large, rocket, proposals, carried, the, nova, name, but, none, were, developed, wernher, von, braun, and, others, also, had, plans, for, a, rocket, that, would, have, featured, eight, f, 1, engines, in, its, first, stage, like, the, saturn, c, 8, allowing, a, direct, ascent, flight, to, the, moon, other, plans, for, the, saturn, v, called, for, using, a, centaur, as, an, upper, stage, or, adding, strap, on, boosters, these, enhancements, would, have, enabled, the, launch, of, large, robotic, spacecraft, to, the, outer, planets, or, the, sending, of, astronauts, to, mars, other, saturn, v, derivatives, analyzed, included, the, saturn, mlv, family, of, modified, launch, vehicles, which, would, have, almost, doubled, the, payload, lift, capability, of, the, standard, saturn, v, and, were, intended, for, use, in, a, proposed, mission, to, mars, by, 1980, in, 1968, boeing, studied, another, saturn, v, derivative, the, saturn, c, 5n, which, included, a, nuclear, thermal, rocket, engine, for, the, third, stage, of, the, vehicle, the, saturn, c, 5n, would, carry, a, considerably, greater, payload, for, interplanetary, spaceflight, work, on, the, nuclear, engines, along, with, all, saturn, v, elvs, ended, in, 1973, the, comet, hllv, was, a, massive, heavy, lift, launch, vehicle, designed, for, the, first, lunar, outpost, program, which, was, in, the, design, phase, from, 1992, to, 1993, under, the, space, exploration, initiative, it, was, a, saturn, v, derived, launch, vehicle, with, over, twice, the, payload, capability, and, would, have, relied, completely, on, existing, technology, all, of, the, comet, hllv, engines, were, modernized, versions, of, their, apollo, counterparts, and, the, fuel, tanks, would, be, stretched, its, main, goal, was, to, support, the, first, lunar, outpost, program, and, future, crewed, mars, missions, it, was, designed, to, be, as, cheap, and, easy, to, operate, as, possible, in, 2006, as, part, of, the, proposed, constellation, program, nasa, unveiled, plans, to, construct, two, shuttle, derived, launch, vehicles, the, ares, i, and, ares, v, which, would, use, some, existing, space, shuttle, and, saturn, v, hardware, and, infrastructure, the, two, rockets, were, intended, to, increase, safety, by, specializing, each, vehicle, for, different, tasks, ares, i, for, crew, launches, and, ares, v, for, cargo, launches, the, original, design, of, the, heavy, lift, ares, v, named, in, homage, to, the, saturn, v, was, 360, feet, 110, m, in, height, and, featured, a, core, stage, based, on, the, space, shuttle, external, tank, with, a, diameter, of, 28, feet, 8, 4, m, it, was, to, be, powered, by, five, rs, 25, engines, and, two, five, segment, space, shuttle, solid, rocket, boosters, srbs, as, the, design, evolved, the, rs, 25, engines, were, replaced, with, five, rs, 68, engines, the, same, engines, used, on, the, delta, iv, the, switch, from, the, rs, 25, to, the, rs, 68, was, intended, to, reduce, cost, as, the, latter, was, cheaper, simpler, to, manufacture, and, more, powerful, than, the, rs, 25, though, the, lower, efficiency, of, the, rs, 68, required, an, increase, in, core, stage, diameter, to, 33, ft, 10, m, the, same, diameter, as, the, saturn, v, s, s, ic, and, s, ii, stages, in, 2008, nasa, again, redesigned, the, ares, v, lengthening, the, core, stage, adding, a, sixth, rs, 68, engine, and, increasing, the, srbs, to, 5, 5, segments, each, this, vehicle, would, have, been, 381, feet, 116, m, tall, and, would, have, produced, a, total, thrust, of, approximately, 8, 900, 000, lbf, 40, mn, at, liftoff, more, than, the, saturn, v, or, the, soviet, energia, but, less, than, the, soviet, n, 1, projected, to, place, approximately, 400, 000, pounds, 180, t, into, orbit, the, ares, v, would, have, surpassed, the, saturn, v, in, payload, capability, an, upper, stage, the, earth, departure, stage, would, have, utilized, a, more, advanced, version, of, the, j, 2, engine, the, j, 2x, ares, v, would, have, placed, the, altair, lunar, landing, vehicle, into, low, earth, orbit, an, orion, crew, vehicle, launched, on, ares, i, would, have, docked, with, altair, and, the, earth, departure, stage, would, then, send, the, combined, stack, to, the, moon, after, the, cancellation, of, the, constellation, program, and, hence, ares, i, and, ares, v, nasa, announced, the, space, launch, system, sls, heavy, lift, launch, vehicle, for, beyond, low, earth, orbit, space, exploration, the, sls, similar, to, the, original, ares, v, concept, is, powered, by, four, rs, 25, engines, and, two, five, segment, srbs, its, block, 1, configuration, can, lift, approximately, 209, 000, pounds, 95, t, to, leo, the, block, 1b, configuration, will, add, the, exploration, upper, stage, powered, by, four, rl10, engines, to, increase, payload, capacity, an, eventual, block, 2, variant, will, upgrade, to, advanced, boosters, increasing, leo, payload, to, at, least, 290, 000, pounds, 130, t, one, proposal, for, advanced, boosters, would, use, a, derivative, of, the, saturn, v, s, f, 1, the, f, 1b, and, increase, sls, payload, to, around, 330, 000, pounds, 150, t, to, leo, the, f, 1b, is, to, have, better, specific, impulse, and, be, cheaper, than, the, f, 1, with, a, simplified, combustion, chamber, and, fewer, engine, parts, while, producing, 1, 800, 000, lbf, 8, 0, mn, of, thrust, at, sea, level, an, increase, over, the, approximate, 1, 550, 000, lbf, 6, 9, mn, achieved, by, the, mature, apollo, 15, f, 1, engine, on, september, 3, 2002, astronomer, bill, yeung, discovered, a, suspected, asteroid, which, was, given, the, discovery, designation, j002e3, it, appeared, to, be, in, orbit, around, the, earth, and, was, soon, discovered, from, spectral, analysis, to, be, covered, in, white, titanium, dioxide, which, was, a, major, constituent, of, the, paint, used, on, the, saturn, v, calculation, of, orbital, parameters, led, to, tentative, identification, as, being, the, apollo, 12, s, ivb, stage, mission, controllers, had, planned, to, send, apollo, 12, s, s, ivb, into, solar, orbit, after, separation, from, the, apollo, spacecraft, but, it, is, believed, the, burn, lasted, too, long, and, hence, did, not, send, it, close, enough, to, the, moon, so, it, remained, in, a, barely, stable, orbit, around, the, earth, and, moon, in, 1971, through, a, series, of, gravitational, perturbations, it, is, believed, to, have, entered, in, a, solar, orbit, and, then, returned, into, weakly, captured, earth, orbit, 31, years, later, it, left, earth, orbit, again, in, june, 2003
