a, highway, is, any, public, or, private, road, or, other, public, way, on, land, it, includes, not, just, major, roads, but, also, other, public, roads, and, rights, of, way, in, the, united, states, it, is, also, used, as, an, equivalent, term, to, controlled, access, highway, or, a, translation, for, motorway, autobahn, autostrada, autoroute, etc, according, to, merriam, webster, the, use, of, the, term, predates, the, 12th, century, according, to, etymonline, high, is, in, the, sense, of, main, in, north, american, and, australian, english, major, roads, such, as, controlled, access, highways, or, arterial, roads, are, often, state, highways, canada, provincial, highways, other, roads, may, be, designated, county, highways, in, the, us, and, ontario, these, classifications, refer, to, the, level, of, government, state, provincial, county, that, maintains, the, roadway, in, british, english, highway, is, primarily, a, legal, term, everyday, use, normally, implies, roads, while, the, legal, use, covers, any, route, or, path, with, a, public, right, of, access, including, footpaths, etc, the, term, has, led, to, several, related, derived, terms, including, highway, system, highway, code, highway, patrol, and, highwayman, major, highways, are, often, named, and, numbered, by, the, governments, that, typically, develop, and, maintain, them, australia, s, highway, 1, is, the, longest, national, highway, in, the, world, at, over, 14, 500, kilometres, 9, 000, mi, and, runs, almost, the, entire, way, around, the, continent, china, has, the, world, s, largest, network, of, highways, followed, closely, by, the, united, states, some, highways, like, the, pan, american, highway, or, the, european, routes, span, multiple, countries, some, major, highway, routes, include, ferry, services, such, as, us, route, 10, which, crosses, lake, michigan, traditionally, highways, were, used, by, people, on, foot, or, on, horses, later, they, also, accommodated, carriages, bicycles, and, eventually, motor, cars, facilitated, by, advancements, in, road, construction, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, many, nations, began, investing, heavily, in, highway, systems, in, an, effort, to, spur, commerce, and, bolster, national, defence, major, highways, that, connect, cities, in, populous, developed, and, developing, countries, usually, incorporate, features, intended, to, enhance, the, road, s, capacity, efficiency, and, safety, to, various, degrees, such, features, include, a, reduction, in, the, number, of, locations, for, user, access, the, use, of, dual, carriageways, with, two, or, more, lanes, on, each, carriageway, and, grade, separated, junctions, with, other, roads, and, modes, of, transport, these, features, are, typically, present, on, highways, built, as, motorways, freeways, the, general, legal, definition, deals, with, right, of, use, not, the, form, of, construction, this, is, distinct, from, e, g, the, popular, use, of, the, word, in, the, us, a, highway, is, defined, in, english, common, law, by, a, number, of, similarly, worded, definitions, such, as, a, way, over, which, all, members, of, the, public, have, the, right, to, pass, and, repass, without, hindrance, usually, accompanied, by, at, all, times, ownership, of, the, ground, is, for, most, purposes, irrelevant, thus, the, term, encompasses, all, such, ways, from, the, widest, trunk, roads, in, public, ownership, to, the, narrowest, footpath, providing, unlimited, pedestrian, access, over, private, land, a, highway, might, be, open, to, all, forms, of, lawful, land, traffic, e, g, vehicular, horse, pedestrian, or, limited, to, specific, modes, of, traffic, usually, a, highway, available, to, vehicles, is, also, available, to, foot, or, horse, traffic, a, highway, available, to, horse, traffic, is, available, to, cyclists, and, pedestrians, but, there, are, exceptional, cases, in, which, a, highway, is, only, available, to, vehicles, or, is, subdivided, into, dedicated, parallel, sections, for, different, users, a, highway, can, share, ground, with, a, private, right, of, way, for, which, full, use, is, not, available, to, the, general, public, for, example, farm, roads, which, the, owner, may, use, for, any, purpose, but, for, which, the, general, public, only, has, a, right, of, use, on, foot, or, horseback, the, status, of, highway, on, most, older, roads, has, been, gained, by, established, public, use, while, newer, roads, are, typically, dedicated, as, highways, from, the, time, they, are, adopted, taken, into, the, care, and, control, of, a, council, or, other, public, authority, in, england, and, wales, a, public, highway, is, also, known, as, the, king, s, highway, the, core, definition, of, a, highway, is, modified, in, various, legislation, for, a, number, of, purposes, but, only, for, the, specific, matters, dealt, with, in, each, such, piece, of, legislation, this, is, typically, in, the, case, of, bridges, tunnels, and, other, structures, whose, ownership, mode, of, use, or, availability, would, otherwise, exclude, them, from, the, general, definition, of, a, highway, recent, examples, include, toll, bridges, and, tunnels, which, have, the, definition, of, highway, imposed, upon, them, in, a, legal, order, applying, only, to, the, individual, structure, to, allow, application, of, most, traffic, laws, to, those, using, them, but, without, causing, all, of, the, general, obligations, or, rights, of, use, otherwise, applicable, to, a, highway, limited, access, highways, for, vehicles, with, their, own, traffic, rules, are, called, motorways, in, the, uk, scots, law, is, similar, to, english, law, with, regard, to, highways, but, with, differing, terminology, and, legislation, what, is, defined, in, england, as, a, highway, will, often, in, scotland, be, what, is, defined, by, s, 151, roads, scotland, act, 1984, but, only, in, this, act, although, other, legislation, could, imitate, simply, as, a, road, that, is, the, word, highway, is, itself, no, longer, a, statutory, expression, in, scots, law, but, remains, in, common, law, in, american, law, the, word, highway, is, sometimes, used, to, denote, any, public, way, used, for, travel, whether, a, road, street, and, parkway, however, in, practical, and, useful, meaning, a, highway, is, a, major, and, significant, well, constructed, road, that, is, capable, of, carrying, reasonably, heavy, to, extremely, heavy, traffic, highways, generally, have, a, route, number, designated, by, the, state, and, federal, departments, of, transportation, california, vehicle, code, sections, 360, 590, define, a, highway, as, only, a, way, open, for, use, by, motor, vehicles, but, the, california, supreme, court, has, held, that, the, definition, of, highway, in, the, vehicle, code, is, used, for, special, purposes, of, that, act, and, that, canals, of, the, los, angeles, neighborhood, of, venice, are, highways, that, are, entitled, to, be, maintained, with, state, highway, funds, large, scale, highway, systems, developed, in, the, 20th, century, as, automobile, usage, increased, the, first, united, states, limited, access, road, was, constructed, on, long, island, new, york, and, known, as, the, long, island, motor, parkway, or, the, vanderbilt, motor, parkway, it, was, completed, in, 1911, it, included, many, modern, features, including, banked, turns, guard, rails, and, reinforced, concrete, tarmac, traffic, could, turn, left, between, the, parkway, and, connectors, crossing, oncoming, traffic, so, it, was, not, a, controlled, access, highway, or, freeway, as, later, defined, by, the, federal, government, s, manual, on, uniform, traffic, control, devices, italy, was, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, build, controlled, access, highways, reserved, for, fast, traffic, and, for, motor, vehicles, only, the, autostrada, dei, laghi, lakes, highway, the, first, built, in, the, world, connecting, milan, to, lake, como, and, lake, maggiore, and, now, parts, of, the, a8, and, a9, highways, was, devised, by, piero, puricelli, and, was, inaugurated, in, 1924, this, highway, called, autostrada, contained, only, one, lane, in, each, direction, and, no, interchanges, the, southern, state, parkway, opened, in, 1927, while, the, long, island, motor, parkway, was, closed, in, 1937, and, replaced, by, the, northern, state, parkway, opened, 1931, and, the, contiguous, grand, central, parkway, opened, 1936, in, germany, construction, of, the, bonn, cologne, autobahn, began, in, 1929, and, was, opened, in, 1932, by, konrad, adenauer, then, the, mayor, of, cologne, in, the, us, the, federal, aid, highway, act, of, 1921, phipps, act, enacted, a, fund, to, create, an, extensive, highway, system, in, 1922, the, first, blueprint, for, a, national, highway, system, the, pershing, map, was, published, the, federal, aid, highway, act, of, 1956, allocated, 25, billion, for, the, construction, of, the, 66, 000, kilometre, long, 41, 000, mi, interstate, highway, system, over, a, 20, year, period, in, great, britain, the, special, roads, act, 1949, provided, the, legislative, basis, for, roads, for, restricted, classes, of, vehicles, and, non, standard, or, no, speed, limits, applied, later, mostly, termed, motorways, but, now, with, speed, limits, not, exceeding, 70, mph, in, terms, of, general, road, law, this, legislation, overturned, the, usual, principle, that, a, road, available, to, vehicular, traffic, was, also, available, to, horse, or, pedestrian, traffic, as, is, usually, the, only, practical, change, when, non, motorways, are, reclassified, as, special, roads, the, first, section, of, motorway, in, the, uk, opened, in, 1958, part, of, the, m6, motorway, and, then, in, 1959, the, first, section, of, the, m1, motorway, often, reducing, travel, times, relative, to, city, or, town, streets, highways, with, limited, access, and, grade, separation, can, create, increased, opportunities, for, people, to, travel, for, business, trade, or, pleasure, and, also, provide, trade, routes, for, goods, highways, can, reduce, commute, and, other, travel, time, but, additional, road, capacity, can, also, release, latent, traffic, demand, if, not, accurately, predicted, at, the, planning, stage, this, extra, traffic, may, lead, to, the, new, road, becoming, congested, sooner, than, would, otherwise, be, anticipated, by, considering, increases, in, vehicle, ownership, more, roads, allow, drivers, to, use, their, cars, when, otherwise, alternatives, may, have, been, sought, or, the, journey, may, not, have, been, made, which, can, mean, that, a, new, road, brings, only, short, term, mitigation, of, traffic, congestion, where, highways, are, created, through, existing, communities, there, can, be, reduced, community, cohesion, and, more, difficult, local, access, consequently, property, values, have, decreased, in, many, cutoff, neighborhoods, leading, to, decreased, housing, quality, over, time, mostly, in, the, u, s, many, of, these, effects, are, from, racist, planning, practices, from, before, the, advent, of, civil, rights, this, would, result, in, the, vast, majority, of, displacement, and, social, effects, mostly, going, to, people, like, african, americans, in, recent, times, the, use, of, freeway, removal, or, the, public, policy, of, urban, planning, to, demolish, freeways, and, create, mixed, use, urban, areas, parks, residential, commercial, or, other, land, uses, is, being, popular, in, many, cities, to, combat, most, of, the, social, problems, caused, from, highways, in, transport, demand, can, be, measured, in, numbers, of, journeys, made, or, in, total, distance, travelled, across, all, journeys, e, g, passenger, kilometres, for, public, transport, or, vehicle, kilometres, of, travel, vkt, for, private, transport, supply, is, considered, to, be, a, measure, of, capacity, the, price, of, the, good, travel, is, measured, using, the, generalised, cost, of, travel, which, includes, both, money, and, time, expenditure, the, effect, of, increases, in, supply, capacity, are, of, particular, interest, in, transport, economics, see, induced, demand, as, the, potential, environmental, consequences, are, significant, see, externalities, below, in, addition, to, providing, benefits, to, their, users, transport, networks, impose, both, positive, and, negative, externalities, on, non, users, the, consideration, of, these, externalities, particularly, the, negative, ones, is, a, part, of, transport, economics, positive, externalities, of, transport, networks, may, include, the, ability, to, provide, emergency, services, increases, in, land, value, and, agglomeration, benefits, negative, externalities, are, wide, ranging, and, may, include, local, air, pollution, noise, pollution, light, pollution, safety, hazards, community, severance, and, congestion, the, contribution, of, transport, systems, to, potentially, hazardous, climate, change, is, a, significant, negative, externality, which, is, difficult, to, evaluate, quantitatively, making, it, difficult, but, not, impossible, to, include, in, transport, economics, based, research, and, analysis, congestion, is, considered, a, negative, externality, by, economists, a, 2016, study, found, that, for, the, united, states, a, 10, increase, in, a, region, s, stock, of, highways, causes, a, 1, 7, increase, in, regional, patenting, over, a, five, year, period, a, 2021, study, found, that, areas, that, obtained, access, to, a, new, highway, experienced, a, substantial, increase, in, top, income, taxpayers, and, a, decline, in, low, income, taxpayers, highways, also, contributed, to, job, and, residential, urban, sprawl, highways, are, extended, linear, sources, of, pollution, roadway, noise, increases, with, operating, speed, so, major, highways, generate, more, noise, than, arterial, streets, therefore, considerable, noise, health, effects, are, expected, from, highway, systems, noise, mitigation, strategies, exist, to, reduce, sound, levels, at, nearby, sensitive, receptors, the, idea, that, highway, design, could, be, influenced, by, acoustical, engineering, considerations, first, arose, about, 1973, air, quality, issues, highways, may, contribute, fewer, emissions, than, arterials, carrying, the, same, vehicle, volumes, this, is, because, high, constant, speed, operation, creates, an, emissions, reduction, compared, to, vehicular, flows, with, stops, and, starts, however, concentrations, of, air, pollutants, near, highways, may, be, higher, due, to, increased, traffic, volumes, therefore, the, risk, of, exposure, to, elevated, levels, of, air, pollutants, from, a, highway, may, be, considerable, and, further, magnified, when, highways, have, traffic, congestion, new, highways, can, also, cause, habitat, fragmentation, encourage, urban, sprawl, and, allow, human, intrusion, into, previously, untouched, areas, as, well, as, counterintuitively, increasing, congestion, by, increasing, the, number, of, intersections, they, can, also, reduce, the, use, of, public, transport, indirectly, leading, to, greater, pollution, high, occupancy, vehicle, lanes, are, being, added, to, some, newer, reconstructed, highways, in, the, united, states, and, other, countries, around, the, world, to, encourage, carpooling, and, mass, transit, these, lanes, help, reduce, the, number, of, cars, on, the, highway, and, thus, reduces, pollution, and, traffic, congestion, by, promoting, the, use, of, carpooling, in, order, to, be, able, to, use, these, lanes, however, they, tend, to, require, dedicated, lanes, on, a, highway, which, makes, them, difficult, to, construct, in, dense, urban, areas, where, they, are, the, most, effective, to, address, habitat, fragmentation, wildlife, crossings, have, become, increasingly, popular, in, many, countries, wildlife, crossings, allow, animals, to, safely, cross, human, made, barriers, like, highways, road, traffic, safety, describes, the, safety, performance, of, roads, and, streets, and, methods, used, to, reduce, the, harm, deaths, injuries, and, property, damage, on, the, highway, system, from, traffic, collisions, it, includes, the, design, construction, and, regulation, of, the, roads, the, vehicles, used, on, them, and, the, training, of, drivers, and, other, road, users, a, report, published, by, the, world, health, organization, in, 2004, estimated, that, some, 1, 2, million, people, were, killed, and, 50, million, injured, on, the, roads, around, the, world, each, year, and, was, the, leading, cause, of, death, among, children, 10, 19, years, of, age, the, report, also, noted, that, the, problem, was, most, severe, in, developing, countries, and, that, simple, prevention, measures, could, halve, the, number, of, deaths, for, reasons, of, clear, data, collection, only, harm, involving, a, road, vehicle, is, included, a, person, tripping, with, fatal, consequences, or, dying, for, some, unrelated, reason, on, a, public, road, is, not, included, in, the, relevant, statistics, the, united, states, has, the, world, s, largest, network, of, highways, including, both, the, interstate, highway, system, and, the, united, states, numbered, highway, system, at, least, one, of, these, networks, is, present, in, every, state, and, they, interconnect, most, major, cities, it, is, also, the, world, s, most, expensive, mega, project, as, the, entirety, of, the, interstate, highway, system, was, estimated, to, cost, 27, billion, in, 1955, equivalent, to, 240, billion, in, 2023, china, s, highway, network, is, the, second, most, extensive, in, the, world, with, a, total, length, of, about, 3, 573, 000, kilometres, 2, 220, 000, mi, china, s, expressway, network, is, the, longest, expressway, system, in, the, world, and, it, is, quickly, expanding, stretching, some, 85, 000, kilometres, 53, 000, mi, at, the, end, of, 2011, in, 2008, alone, 6, 433, kilometres, 3, 997, mi, expressways, were, added, to, the, network, in, south, korea, in, february, 1995, a, bus, lane, essentially, an, hov, 9, was, established, between, the, northern, terminus, and, sintanjin, for, important, holidays, and, on, 1, july, 2008, bus, lane, enforcement, between, seoul, and, osan, sintanjin, on, weekends, became, daily, between, 6, a, m, and, 10, p, m, on, 1, october, this, was, adjusted, to, 7, a, m, to, 9, p, m, weekdays, and, 9, a, m, to, 9, p, m, weekends, in, hong, kong, some, highways, are, set, up, with, bus, lanes, to, solve, the, traffic, congestion, traffic, congestion, was, a, principal, problem, in, major, roads, and, highways, in, the, philippines, especially, in, metro, manila, and, other, major, cities, the, government, decided, to, set, up, some, bus, lanes, in, metro, manila, like, in, the, epifanio, delos, santos, avenue, the, following, is, a, list, of, highways, by, country, in, alphabetical, order
