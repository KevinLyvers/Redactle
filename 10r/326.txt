https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_control_in_the_Netherlands
flood, control, is, an, important, issue, for, the, netherlands, as, due, to, its, low, elevation, approximately, two, thirds, of, its, area, is, vulnerable, to, flooding, while, the, country, is, densely, populated, natural, sand, dunes, and, constructed, dikes, dams, and, floodgates, provide, defense, against, storm, surges, from, the, sea, river, dikes, prevent, flooding, from, water, flowing, into, the, country, by, the, major, rivers, rhine, and, meuse, while, a, complicated, system, of, drainage, ditches, canals, and, pumping, stations, historically, windmills, keep, the, low, lying, parts, dry, for, habitation, and, agriculture, water, control, boards, are, the, independent, local, government, bodies, responsible, for, maintaining, this, system, in, modern, times, flood, disasters, coupled, with, technological, developments, have, led, to, large, construction, works, to, reduce, the, influence, of, the, sea, and, prevent, future, floods, these, have, proved, essential, over, the, course, of, dutch, history, both, geographically, and, militarily, and, have, greatly, impacted, the, lives, of, many, living, in, the, cities, affected, stimulating, their, economies, through, constant, infrastructural, improvement, the, greek, geographer, pytheas, noted, of, the, low, countries, as, he, passed, them, on, his, way, to, heligoland, c, 325, bce, that, more, people, died, in, the, struggle, against, water, than, in, the, struggle, against, men, roman, author, pliny, of, the, 1st, century, wrote, something, similar, in, his, natural, history, there, twice, in, every, twenty, four, hours, the, ocean, s, vast, tide, sweeps, in, a, flood, over, a, large, stretch, of, land, and, hides, nature, s, everlasting, controversy, about, whether, this, region, belongs, to, the, land, or, to, the, sea, there, these, wretched, peoples, occupy, high, ground, or, manmade, platforms, constructed, above, the, level, of, the, highest, tide, they, experience, they, live, in, huts, built, on, the, site, so, chosen, and, are, like, sailors, in, ships, when, the, waters, cover, the, surrounding, land, but, when, the, tide, has, receded, they, are, like, shipwrecked, victims, around, their, huts, they, catch, fish, as, they, try, to, escape, with, the, ebbing, tide, it, does, not, fall, to, their, lot, to, keep, herds, and, live, on, milk, like, neighboring, tribes, nor, even, to, fight, with, wild, animals, since, all, undergrowth, has, been, pushed, far, back, the, flood, threatened, area, of, the, netherlands, is, essentially, an, alluvial, plain, built, up, from, sediment, left, by, thousands, of, years, of, flooding, by, rivers, and, the, sea, about, 2, 000, years, ago, most, of, the, netherlands, was, covered, by, extensive, peat, swamps, the, coast, consisted, of, a, row, of, coastal, dunes, and, natural, embankments, which, kept, the, swamps, from, draining, but, also, from, being, washed, away, by, the, sea, the, only, areas, suitable, for, habitation, were, on, the, higher, grounds, in, the, east, and, south, and, on, the, dunes, and, natural, embankments, along, the, coast, and, the, rivers, in, several, places, the, sea, had, broken, through, these, natural, defenses, and, created, extensive, floodplains, in, the, north, the, first, permanent, inhabitants, of, this, area, were, probably, attracted, by, the, sea, deposited, clay, soil, which, was, much, more, fertile, than, the, peat, and, sandy, soil, further, inland, to, protect, themselves, against, floods, they, built, their, homes, on, artificial, dwelling, hills, called, terpen, or, wierden, known, as, warften, or, halligen, in, germany, between, 500, bc, and, ad, 700, there, were, probably, several, periods, of, habitation, and, abandonment, as, the, sea, level, periodically, rose, and, fell, the, first, dikes, were, low, embankments, of, only, a, meter, or, so, in, height, surrounding, fields, to, protect, the, crops, against, occasional, flooding, around, the, 9th, century, the, sea, was, on, the, advance, again, and, many, terps, had, to, be, raised, to, keep, them, safe, many, single, terps, had, by, this, time, grown, together, as, villages, these, were, now, connected, by, the, first, dikes, after, about, ad, 1000, the, population, grew, which, meant, there, was, a, greater, demand, for, arable, land, but, also, that, there, was, a, greater, workforce, available, and, dike, construction, was, taken, up, more, seriously, the, major, contributors, in, later, dike, building, were, the, monasteries, as, the, largest, landowners, they, had, the, organization, resources, and, manpower, to, undertake, the, large, construction, by, 1250, most, dikes, had, been, connected, into, a, continuous, sea, defense, the, next, step, was, to, move, the, dikes, ever, more, seawards, every, cycle, of, high, and, low, tide, left, a, small, layer, of, sediment, over, the, years, these, layers, had, built, up, to, such, a, height, that, they, were, rarely, flooded, it, was, then, considered, safe, to, build, a, new, dike, around, this, area, the, old, dike, was, often, kept, as, a, secondary, defense, called, a, sleeper, dike, a, dike, could, not, always, be, moved, seawards, especially, in, the, southwest, river, delta, it, was, often, the, case, that, the, primary, sea, dike, was, undermined, by, a, tidal, channel, a, secondary, dike, was, then, built, called, an, inlaagdijk, with, an, inland, dike, when, the, seaward, dike, collapses, the, secondary, inland, dike, becomes, the, primary, although, the, redundancy, provides, security, the, land, from, the, first, to, second, dike, is, lost, over, the, years, the, loss, can, become, significant, taking, land, from, the, cycle, of, flooding, by, putting, a, dike, around, it, prevents, it, from, being, raised, by, silt, left, behind, after, a, flooding, at, the, same, time, the, drained, soil, consolidates, and, peat, decomposes, leading, to, land, subsidence, in, this, way, the, difference, between, the, water, level, on, one, side, and, land, level, on, the, other, side, of, the, dike, grew, while, floods, became, more, rare, if, the, dike, did, overflow, or, was, breached, the, destruction, was, much, larger, the, construction, method, of, dikes, has, changed, over, the, centuries, popular, in, the, middle, ages, were, wierdijken, earth, dikes, with, a, protective, layer, of, seaweed, an, earth, embankment, was, cut, vertically, on, the, sea, facing, side, seaweed, was, then, stacked, against, this, edge, held, into, place, with, poles, compression, and, rotting, processes, resulted, in, a, solid, residue, that, proved, very, effective, against, wave, action, and, they, needed, very, little, maintenance, in, places, where, seaweed, was, unavailable, other, materials, such, as, reeds, or, wicker, mats, were, used, another, system, used, much, and, for, a, long, time, was, that, of, a, vertical, screen, of, timbers, backed, by, an, earth, bank, technically, these, vertical, constructions, were, less, successful, as, vibration, from, crashing, waves, and, washing, out, of, the, dike, foundations, weakened, the, dike, much, damage, was, done, to, these, wood, constructions, with, the, arrival, of, the, shipworm, teredo, navalis, a, bivalve, thought, to, have, been, brought, to, the, netherlands, by, voc, trading, ships, that, ate, its, way, through, dutch, sea, defenses, around, 1730, the, change, was, made, from, wood, to, using, stone, for, reinforcement, this, was, a, great, financial, setback, as, there, is, no, naturally, occurring, rock, in, the, netherlands, and, it, all, had, to, be, imported, from, abroad, current, dikes, are, made, with, a, core, of, sand, covered, by, a, thick, layer, of, clay, to, provide, waterproofing, and, resistance, against, erosion, dikes, without, a, foreland, have, a, layer, of, crushed, rock, below, the, waterline, to, slow, wave, action, up, to, the, high, waterline, the, dike, is, often, covered, with, carefully, laid, basalt, stones, or, a, layer, of, tarmac, the, remainder, is, covered, by, grass, and, maintained, by, grazing, sheep, sheep, keep, the, grass, dense, and, compact, the, soil, in, contrast, to, cattle, at, about, the, same, time, as, the, building, of, dikes, the, first, swamps, were, made, suitable, for, agriculture, by, colonists, by, digging, a, system, of, parallel, drainage, ditches, water, was, drained, from, the, land, to, be, able, to, grow, grain, however, the, peat, settled, much, more, than, other, soil, types, when, drained, and, land, subsidence, resulted, in, developed, areas, becoming, wet, again, cultivated, lands, which, were, at, first, primarily, used, for, growing, grain, thus, became, too, wet, and, the, switch, was, made, to, dairy, farming, a, new, area, behind, the, existing, field, was, then, cultivated, heading, deeper, into, the, wild, this, cycle, repeated, itself, several, times, until, the, different, developments, met, each, other, and, no, further, undeveloped, land, was, available, all, land, was, then, used, for, grazing, cattle, because, of, the, continuous, land, subsidence, it, became, ever, more, difficult, to, remove, excess, water, the, mouths, of, streams, and, rivers, were, dammed, to, prevent, high, water, levels, flowing, back, upstream, and, overflowing, cultivated, lands, these, dams, had, a, wooden, culvert, equipped, with, a, valve, allowing, drainage, but, preventing, water, from, flowing, upstream, these, dams, however, blocked, shipping, and, the, economic, activity, caused, by, the, need, to, transship, goods, caused, villages, to, grow, up, near, the, dam, some, famous, examples, are, amsterdam, dam, in, the, river, amstel, and, rotterdam, dam, in, the, rotte, only, in, later, centuries, were, locks, developed, to, allow, ships, to, pass, further, drainage, could, only, be, accomplished, after, the, development, of, the, polder, windmill, in, the, 15th, century, the, wind, driven, water, pump, has, become, one, of, the, trademark, tourist, attractions, of, the, netherlands, the, first, drainage, mills, using, a, scoop, wheel, could, raise, water, at, most, 1, 5, m, by, combining, mills, the, pumping, height, could, be, increased, later, mills, were, equipped, with, an, archimedes, screw, which, could, raise, water, much, higher, the, polders, now, often, below, sea, level, were, kept, dry, with, mills, pumping, water, from, the, polder, ditches, and, canals, to, the, boezem, bosom, a, system, of, canals, and, lakes, connecting, the, different, polders, and, acting, as, a, storage, basin, until, the, water, could, be, let, out, to, river, or, sea, either, by, a, sluice, gate, at, low, tide, or, using, further, pumps, this, system, is, still, in, use, today, though, drainage, mills, have, been, replaced, by, first, steam, and, later, diesel, and, electric, pumping, stations, the, growth, of, towns, and, industry, in, the, middle, ages, resulted, in, an, increased, demand, for, dried, peat, as, fuel, first, all, the, peat, down, to, the, groundwater, table, was, dug, away, in, the, 16th, century, a, method, was, developed, to, dig, peat, below, water, using, a, dredging, net, on, a, long, pole, large, scale, peat, dredging, was, taken, up, by, companies, supported, by, investors, from, the, cities, these, undertakings, often, devastated, the, landscape, as, agricultural, land, was, dug, away, and, the, leftover, ridges, used, for, drying, the, peat, collapsed, under, the, action, of, waves, small, lakes, were, created, which, quickly, grew, in, area, every, increase, in, surface, water, leading, to, more, leverage, of, the, wind, on, the, water, to, attack, more, land, it, even, led, to, villages, being, lost, to, the, waves, of, human, made, lakes, the, development, of, the, polder, mill, gave, the, option, of, draining, the, lakes, in, the, 16th, century, this, work, was, started, on, small, shallow, lakes, continuing, with, ever, larger, and, deeper, lakes, though, it, was, not, until, in, the, 19th, century, that, the, most, dangerous, of, lakes, the, haarlemmermeer, near, amsterdam, was, drained, using, steam, power, drained, lakes, and, new, polders, can, often, be, easily, distinguished, on, topographic, maps, by, their, different, regular, division, pattern, as, compared, to, their, older, surroundings, millwright, and, hydraulic, engineer, jan, leeghwater, has, become, famous, for, his, involvement, in, these, works, three, major, european, rivers, the, rhine, meuse, and, scheldt, flow, through, the, netherlands, of, which, the, rhine, and, meuse, cross, the, country, from, east, to, west, the, first, large, construction, works, on, the, rivers, were, conducted, by, the, romans, nero, claudius, drusus, was, responsible, for, building, a, dam, in, the, rhine, to, divert, water, from, the, river, branches, waal, to, the, nederrijn, and, possibly, for, connecting, the, river, ijssel, previously, only, a, small, stream, to, the, rhine, whether, these, were, intended, as, flood, control, measures, or, just, for, military, defense, and, transport, purposes, is, unclear, the, first, river, dikes, appeared, near, the, river, mouths, in, the, 11th, century, where, incursions, from, the, sea, added, to, the, danger, from, high, water, levels, on, the, river, local, rulers, dammed, branches, of, rivers, to, prevent, flooding, on, their, lands, graaf, van, holland, c, 1160, kromme, rijn, floris, v, 1285, hollandse, ijssel, only, to, cause, problems, to, others, living, further, upstream, large, scale, deforestation, upstream, caused, the, river, levels, to, become, ever, more, extreme, while, the, demand, for, arable, land, led, to, more, land, being, protected, by, dikes, giving, less, space, to, the, river, stream, bed, and, so, causing, even, higher, water, levels, local, dikes, to, protect, villages, were, connected, to, create, a, ban, dike, to, contain, the, river, at, all, times, these, developments, meant, that, while, the, regular, floods, for, the, first, inhabitants, of, the, river, valleys, were, just, a, nuisance, in, contrast, the, later, incidental, floods, when, dikes, burst, were, much, more, destructive, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, were, a, period, of, many, infamous, river, floods, resulting, in, much, loss, of, life, they, were, often, caused, by, ice, dams, blocking, the, river, land, reclamation, works, large, willow, plantations, and, building, in, the, winter, bed, of, the, river, all, worsened, the, problem, next, to, the, obvious, clearing, of, the, winter, bed, overflows, overlaten, were, created, these, were, intentionally, low, dikes, where, the, excess, water, could, be, diverted, downstream, the, land, in, such, a, diversion, channel, was, kept, clear, of, buildings, and, obstructions, as, this, so, called, green, river, could, therefore, essentially, only, be, used, for, grazing, cattle, it, was, in, later, centuries, seen, as, a, wasteful, use, of, land, most, overflows, have, now, been, removed, focusing, instead, on, stronger, dikes, and, more, control, over, the, distribution, of, water, across, the, river, branches, to, achieve, this, canals, such, as, the, pannerdens, kanaal, and, nieuwe, merwede, were, dug, a, committee, reported, in, 1977, about, the, weakness, of, the, river, dikes, but, there, was, too, much, resistance, from, the, local, population, against, demolishing, houses, and, straightening, and, strengthening, the, old, meandering, dikes, it, took, the, flood, threats, in, 1993, and, again, in, 1995, when, over, 200, 000, people, had, to, be, evacuated, and, the, dikes, only, just, held, to, put, plans, into, action, now, the, risk, of, a, river, flooding, has, been, reduced, from, once, every, 100, years, to, once, every, 1, 250, years, further, works, in, the, room, for, the, river, project, are, being, carried, out, to, give, the, rivers, more, space, to, flood, and, in, this, way, reducing, the, flood, height, the, first, dikes, and, water, control, structures, were, built, and, maintained, by, those, directly, benefiting, from, them, mostly, farmers, as, the, structures, got, more, extensive, and, complex, councils, were, formed, from, people, with, a, common, interest, in, the, control, of, water, levels, on, their, land, and, so, the, first, water, boards, began, to, emerge, these, often, controlled, only, a, small, area, a, single, polder, or, dike, later, they, merged, or, an, overall, organization, was, formed, when, different, water, boards, had, conflicting, interests, the, original, water, boards, differed, much, from, each, other, in, the, organisation, power, and, area, that, they, managed, the, differences, were, often, regional, and, were, dictated, by, differing, circumstances, whether, they, had, to, defend, a, sea, dike, against, a, storm, surge, or, keep, the, water, level, in, a, polder, within, bounds, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, there, were, about, 2, 700, water, control, boards, after, many, mergers, there, are, currently, 21, water, boards, left, water, boards, hold, separate, elections, levy, taxes, and, function, independently, from, other, government, bodies, the, dikes, were, maintained, by, the, individuals, who, benefited, from, their, existence, every, farmer, having, been, designated, part, of, the, dike, to, maintain, with, a, three, yearly, viewing, by, the, water, board, directors, the, old, rule, whom, the, water, hurts, he, the, water, stops, wie, het, water, deert, die, het, water, keert, meant, that, those, living, at, the, dike, had, to, pay, and, care, for, it, this, led, to, haphazard, maintenance, and, it, is, believed, that, many, floods, would, not, have, happened, or, would, not, have, been, as, severe, if, the, dikes, had, been, in, better, condition, those, living, further, inland, often, refused, to, pay, or, help, in, the, upkeep, of, the, dikes, though, they, were, just, as, much, affected, by, floods, while, those, living, at, the, dike, itself, could, go, bankrupt, from, having, to, repair, a, breached, dike, rijkswaterstaat, directorate, general, for, public, works, and, water, management, was, set, up, in, 1798, under, french, rule, to, put, water, control, in, the, netherlands, under, a, central, government, local, waterboards, however, were, too, attached, to, their, autonomy, and, for, most, of, the, time, rijkswaterstaat, worked, alongside, the, local, waterboards, rijkswaterstaat, has, been, responsible, for, many, major, water, control, structures, and, was, later, and, still, is, also, involved, in, building, railroads, and, highways, water, boards, may, try, new, experiments, like, the, sand, engine, off, the, coast, of, south, holland, over, the, years, there, have, been, many, storm, surges, and, floods, in, the, netherlands, some, deserve, special, mention, as, they, particularly, have, changed, the, contours, of, the, netherlands, a, series, of, devastating, storm, surges, more, or, less, starting, with, the, first, all, saints, flood, allerheiligenvloed, in, 1170, washed, away, a, large, area, of, peat, marshes, enlarging, the, wadden, sea, and, connecting, the, previously, existing, lake, almere, in, the, middle, of, the, country, to, the, north, sea, thereby, creating, the, zuiderzee, it, in, itself, would, cause, much, trouble, until, the, building, of, the, afsluitdijk, in, 1933, several, storms, starting, in, 1219, created, the, dollart, from, the, mouth, of, the, river, ems, by, 1520, the, dollart, had, reached, its, largest, area, reiderland, containing, several, towns, and, villages, was, lost, much, of, this, land, was, later, reclaimed, in, 1421, the, st, elizabeth, s, flood, caused, the, loss, of, de, grote, waard, in, the, southwest, of, the, country, particularly, the, digging, of, peat, near, the, dike, for, salt, production, and, neglect, because, of, a, civil, war, caused, dikes, to, fail, which, created, the, biesbosch, now, a, valued, nature, reserve, the, more, recent, floodings, of, 1916, and, 1953, gave, rise, to, building, the, afsluitdijk, and, deltaworks, respectively, the, deliberate, inundating, of, certain, areas, can, allow, a, military, defensive, line, to, be, created, in, case, of, an, advancing, enemy, army, the, area, was, to, be, inundated, with, about, 30, cm, 1, ft, of, water, too, shallow, for, boats, but, deep, enough, to, make, advance, on, foot, difficult, by, hiding, underwater, obstacles, such, as, canals, ditches, and, purpose, built, traps, dikes, crossing, the, flooded, area, and, other, strategic, points, were, to, be, protected, by, fortifications, the, system, proved, successful, on, the, hollandic, water, line, in, rampjaar, 1672, during, the, third, anglo, dutch, war, but, was, overcome, in, 1795, because, of, heavy, frost, it, was, also, used, with, the, stelling, van, amsterdam, the, grebbe, line, and, the, ijssel, line, the, advent, of, heavier, artillery, and, especially, airplanes, have, made, that, strategy, largely, obsolete, technological, development, in, the, 20th, century, meant, that, larger, projects, could, be, undertaken, to, further, improve, the, safety, against, flooding, and, to, reclaim, large, areas, of, land, the, most, important, are, the, zuiderzee, works, and, the, delta, works, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, all, sea, inlets, have, been, closed, off, from, the, sea, by, dams, and, barriers, only, the, westerschelde, needs, to, remain, open, for, shipping, access, to, the, port, of, antwerp, plans, to, reclaim, parts, of, the, wadden, sea, and, the, markermeer, were, eventually, called, off, because, of, the, ecological, and, recreational, values, of, these, waters, the, zuiderzee, works, zuiderzeewerken, are, a, system, of, dams, land, reclamation, and, water, drainage, works, the, basis, of, the, project, was, the, damming, off, of, the, zuiderzee, a, large, shallow, inlet, of, the, north, sea, this, dam, called, the, afsluitdijk, was, built, in, 1932, 33, separating, the, zuiderzee, from, the, north, sea, as, result, the, zuider, sea, became, the, ijsselmeer, ijssel, lake, following, the, damming, large, areas, of, land, were, reclaimed, in, the, newly, freshwater, lake, body, by, means, of, polders, the, works, were, performed, in, several, steps, from, 1920, to, 1975, engineer, cornelis, lely, played, a, major, part, in, its, design, and, as, statesman, in, the, authorization, of, its, construction, a, study, done, by, rijkswaterstaat, in, 1937, showed, that, the, sea, defenses, in, the, southwest, river, delta, were, inadequate, to, withstand, a, major, storm, surge, the, proposed, solution, was, to, dam, all, the, river, mouths, and, sea, inlets, thereby, shortening, the, coast, however, because, of, the, scale, of, this, project, and, the, intervention, of, the, second, world, war, its, construction, was, delayed, and, the, first, works, were, only, completed, in, 1950, the, north, sea, flood, of, 1953, gave, a, major, impulse, to, speed, up, the, project, in, the, following, years, a, number, of, dams, were, built, to, close, off, the, estuary, mouths, in, 1976, under, pressures, from, environmental, groups, and, the, fishing, industry, it, was, decided, not, to, close, off, the, oosterschelde, estuary, by, a, solid, dam, but, instead, to, build, the, oosterscheldekering, a, storm, surge, barrier, which, is, only, closed, during, storms, it, is, the, most, well, known, and, most, expensive, dam, of, the, project, a, second, major, hurdle, for, the, works, was, in, the, rijnmond, area, a, storm, surge, through, the, nieuwe, waterweg, would, threaten, about, 1, 5, million, people, around, rotterdam, however, closing, off, this, river, mouth, would, be, very, detrimental, for, the, dutch, economy, as, the, port, of, rotterdam, one, of, the, biggest, sea, ports, in, the, world, uses, this, river, mouth, eventually, the, maeslantkering, was, built, in, 1997, keeping, economical, factors, in, mind, the, maeslantkering, is, a, set, of, two, swinging, doors, that, can, shut, off, the, river, mouth, when, necessary, but, which, are, usually, open, the, maeslantkering, is, forecast, to, close, about, once, per, decade, up, until, january, 2012, it, has, closed, only, once, in, 2007, the, current, sea, defenses, are, stronger, than, ever, but, experts, warn, that, complacency, would, be, a, mistake, new, calculation, methods, revealed, numerous, weak, spots, sea, level, rise, could, increase, the, mean, sea, level, by, one, to, two, meters, by, the, end, of, this, century, with, even, more, following, this, land, subsidence, and, increased, storms, make, further, upgrades, to, the, flood, control, and, water, management, infrastructure, necessary, the, sea, defenses, are, continuously, being, strengthened, and, raised, to, meet, the, safety, norm, of, a, flood, chance, of, once, every, 10, 000, years, for, the, west, which, is, the, economic, heart, and, most, densely,
