character, encoding, is, the, process, of, assigning, numbers, to, graphical, characters, especially, the, written, characters, of, human, language, allowing, them, to, be, stored, transmitted, and, transformed, using, digital, computers, the, numerical, values, that, make, up, a, character, encoding, are, known, as, code, points, and, collectively, comprise, a, code, space, a, code, page, or, a, character, map, early, character, codes, associated, with, the, optical, or, electrical, telegraph, could, only, represent, a, subset, of, the, characters, used, in, written, languages, sometimes, restricted, to, upper, case, letters, numerals, and, some, punctuation, only, the, low, cost, of, digital, representation, of, data, in, modern, computer, systems, allows, more, elaborate, character, codes, such, as, unicode, which, represent, most, of, the, characters, used, in, many, written, languages, character, encoding, using, internationally, accepted, standards, permits, worldwide, interchange, of, text, in, electronic, form, the, most, used, character, encoding, on, the, web, is, utf, 8, used, in, 98, 2, of, surveyed, web, sites, as, of, may, 2024, in, application, programs, and, operating, system, tasks, both, utf, 8, and, utf, 16, are, popular, options, the, history, of, character, codes, illustrates, the, evolving, need, for, machine, mediated, character, based, symbolic, information, over, a, distance, using, once, novel, electrical, means, the, earliest, codes, were, based, upon, manual, and, hand, written, encoding, and, cyphering, systems, such, as, bacon, s, cipher, braille, international, maritime, signal, flags, and, the, 4, digit, encoding, of, chinese, characters, for, a, chinese, telegraph, code, hans, schjellerup, 1869, with, the, adoption, of, electrical, and, electro, mechanical, techniques, these, earliest, codes, were, adapted, to, the, new, capabilities, and, limitations, of, the, early, machines, the, earliest, well, known, electrically, transmitted, character, code, morse, code, introduced, in, the, 1840s, used, a, system, of, four, symbols, short, signal, long, signal, short, space, long, space, to, generate, codes, of, variable, length, though, some, commercial, use, of, morse, code, was, via, machinery, it, was, often, used, as, a, manual, code, generated, by, hand, on, a, telegraph, key, and, decipherable, by, ear, and, persists, in, amateur, radio, and, aeronautical, use, most, codes, are, of, fixed, per, character, length, or, variable, length, sequences, of, fixed, length, codes, e, g, unicode, common, examples, of, character, encoding, systems, include, morse, code, the, baudot, code, the, american, standard, code, for, information, interchange, ascii, and, unicode, unicode, a, well, defined, and, extensible, encoding, system, has, supplanted, most, earlier, character, encodings, but, the, path, of, code, development, to, the, present, is, fairly, well, known, the, baudot, code, a, five, bit, encoding, was, created, by, mile, baudot, in, 1870, patented, in, 1874, modified, by, donald, murray, in, 1901, and, standardized, by, ccitt, as, international, telegraph, alphabet, no, 2, ita2, in, 1930, the, name, baudot, has, been, erroneously, applied, to, ita2, and, its, many, variants, ita2, suffered, from, many, shortcomings, and, was, often, improved, by, many, equipment, manufacturers, sometimes, creating, compatibility, issues, in, 1959, the, u, s, military, defined, its, fieldata, code, a, six, or, seven, bit, code, introduced, by, the, u, s, army, signal, corps, while, fieldata, addressed, many, of, the, then, modern, issues, e, g, letter, and, digit, codes, arranged, for, machine, collation, it, fell, short, of, its, goals, and, was, short, lived, in, 1963, the, first, ascii, code, was, released, x3, 4, 1963, by, the, ascii, committee, which, contained, at, least, one, member, of, the, fieldata, committee, w, f, leubbert, which, addressed, most, of, the, shortcomings, of, fieldata, using, a, simpler, code, many, of, the, changes, were, subtle, such, as, collatable, character, sets, within, certain, numeric, ranges, ascii63, was, a, success, widely, adopted, by, industry, and, with, the, follow, up, issue, of, the, 1967, ascii, code, which, added, lower, case, letters, and, fixed, some, control, code, issues, ascii67, was, adopted, fairly, widely, ascii67, s, american, centric, nature, was, somewhat, addressed, in, the, european, ecma, 6, standard, herman, hollerith, invented, punch, card, data, encoding, in, the, late, 19th, century, to, analyze, census, data, initially, each, hole, position, represented, a, different, data, element, but, later, numeric, information, was, encoded, by, numbering, the, lower, rows, 0, to, 9, with, a, punch, in, a, column, representing, its, row, number, later, alphabetic, data, was, encoded, by, allowing, more, than, one, punch, per, column, electromechanical, tabulating, machines, represented, date, internally, by, the, timing, of, pulses, relative, to, the, motion, of, the, cards, through, the, machine, when, ibm, went, to, electronic, processing, starting, with, the, ibm, 603, electronic, multiplier, it, used, a, variety, of, binary, encoding, schemes, that, were, tied, to, the, punch, card, code, ibm, used, several, binary, coded, decimal, bcd, six, bit, character, encoding, schemes, starting, as, early, as, 1953, in, its, 702, and, 704, computers, and, in, its, later, 7000, series, and, 1400, series, as, well, as, in, associated, peripherals, since, the, punched, card, code, then, in, use, only, allowed, digits, upper, case, english, letters, and, a, few, special, characters, six, bits, were, sufficient, these, bcd, encodings, extended, existing, simple, four, bit, numeric, encoding, to, include, alphabetic, and, special, characters, mapping, them, easily, to, punch, card, encoding, which, was, already, in, widespread, use, ibm, s, codes, were, used, primarily, with, ibm, equipment, other, computer, vendors, of, the, era, had, their, own, character, codes, often, six, bit, but, usually, had, the, ability, to, read, tapes, produced, on, ibm, equipment, these, bcd, encodings, were, the, precursors, of, ibm, s, extended, binary, coded, decimal, interchange, code, usually, abbreviated, as, ebcdic, an, eight, bit, encoding, scheme, developed, in, 1963, for, the, ibm, system, 360, that, featured, a, larger, character, set, including, lower, case, letters, in, trying, to, develop, universally, interchangeable, character, encodings, researchers, in, the, 1980s, faced, the, dilemma, that, on, the, one, hand, it, seemed, necessary, to, add, more, bits, to, accommodate, additional, characters, but, on, the, other, hand, for, the, users, of, the, relatively, small, character, set, of, the, latin, alphabet, who, still, constituted, the, majority, of, computer, users, those, additional, bits, were, a, colossal, waste, of, then, scarce, and, expensive, computing, resources, as, they, would, always, be, zeroed, out, for, such, users, in, 1985, the, average, personal, computer, user, s, hard, disk, drive, could, store, only, about, 10, megabytes, and, it, cost, approximately, us, 250, on, the, wholesale, market, and, much, higher, if, purchased, separately, at, retail, so, it, was, very, important, at, the, time, to, make, every, bit, count, the, compromise, solution, that, was, eventually, found, and, developed, into, unicode, was, to, break, the, assumption, dating, back, to, telegraph, codes, that, each, character, should, always, directly, correspond, to, a, particular, sequence, of, bits, instead, characters, would, first, be, mapped, to, a, universal, intermediate, representation, in, the, form, of, abstract, numbers, called, code, points, code, points, would, then, be, represented, in, a, variety, of, ways, and, with, various, default, numbers, of, bits, per, character, code, units, depending, on, context, to, encode, code, points, higher, than, the, length, of, the, code, unit, such, as, above, 256, for, eight, bit, units, the, solution, was, to, implement, variable, length, encodings, where, an, escape, sequence, would, signal, that, subsequent, bits, should, be, parsed, as, a, higher, code, point, informally, the, terms, character, encoding, character, map, character, set, and, code, page, are, often, used, interchangeably, historically, the, same, standard, would, specify, a, repertoire, of, characters, and, how, they, were, to, be, encoded, into, a, stream, of, code, units, usually, with, a, single, character, per, code, unit, however, due, to, the, emergence, of, more, sophisticated, character, encodings, the, distinction, between, these, terms, has, become, important, code, page, is, a, historical, name, for, a, coded, character, set, originally, a, code, page, referred, to, a, specific, page, number, in, the, ibm, standard, character, set, manual, which, would, define, a, particular, character, encoding, other, vendors, including, microsoft, sap, and, oracle, corporation, also, published, their, own, sets, of, code, pages, the, most, well, known, code, page, suites, are, windows, based, on, windows, 1252, and, ibm, dos, based, on, code, page, 437, despite, no, longer, referring, to, specific, page, numbers, in, a, standard, many, character, encodings, are, still, referred, to, by, their, code, page, number, likewise, the, term, code, page, is, often, still, used, to, refer, to, character, encodings, in, general, the, term, code, page, is, not, used, in, unix, or, linux, where, charmap, is, preferred, usually, in, the, larger, context, of, locales, ibm, s, character, data, representation, architecture, cdra, designates, entities, with, coded, character, set, identifiers, ccsids, each, of, which, is, variously, called, a, charset, character, set, code, page, or, charmap, the, code, unit, size, is, equivalent, to, the, bit, measurement, for, the, particular, encoding, a, code, point, is, represented, by, a, sequence, of, code, units, the, mapping, is, defined, by, the, encoding, thus, the, number, of, code, units, required, to, represent, a, code, point, depends, on, the, encoding, exactly, what, constitutes, a, character, varies, between, character, encodings, for, example, for, letters, with, diacritics, there, are, two, distinct, approaches, that, can, be, taken, to, encode, them, they, can, be, encoded, either, as, a, single, unified, character, known, as, a, precomposed, character, or, as, separate, characters, that, combine, into, a, single, glyph, the, former, simplifies, the, text, handling, system, but, the, latter, allows, any, letter, diacritic, combination, to, be, used, in, text, ligatures, pose, similar, problems, exactly, how, to, handle, glyph, variants, is, a, choice, that, must, be, made, when, constructing, a, particular, character, encoding, some, writing, systems, such, as, arabic, and, hebrew, need, to, accommodate, things, like, graphemes, that, are, joined, in, different, ways, in, different, contexts, but, represent, the, same, semantic, character, unicode, and, its, parallel, standard, the, iso, iec, 10646, universal, character, set, together, constitute, a, unified, standard, for, character, encoding, rather, than, mapping, characters, directly, to, bytes, unicode, separately, defines, a, coded, character, set, that, maps, characters, to, unique, natural, numbers, code, points, how, those, code, points, are, mapped, to, a, series, of, fixed, size, natural, numbers, code, units, and, finally, how, those, units, are, encoded, as, a, stream, of, octets, bytes, the, purpose, of, this, decomposition, is, to, establish, a, universal, set, of, characters, that, can, be, encoded, in, a, variety, of, ways, to, describe, this, model, precisely, unicode, uses, its, own, set, of, terminology, to, describe, its, process, an, abstract, character, repertoire, acr, is, the, full, set, of, abstract, characters, that, a, system, supports, unicode, has, an, open, repertoire, meaning, that, new, characters, will, be, added, to, the, repertoire, over, time, a, coded, character, set, ccs, is, a, function, that, maps, characters, to, code, points, each, code, point, represents, one, character, for, example, in, a, given, repertoire, the, capital, letter, a, in, the, latin, alphabet, might, be, represented, by, the, code, point, 65, the, character, b, by, 66, and, so, on, multiple, coded, character, sets, may, share, the, same, character, repertoire, for, example, iso, iec, 8859, 1, and, ibm, code, pages, 037, and, 500, all, cover, the, same, repertoire, but, map, them, to, different, code, points, a, character, encoding, form, cef, is, the, mapping, of, code, points, to, code, units, to, facilitate, storage, in, a, system, that, represents, numbers, as, bit, sequences, of, fixed, length, i, e, practically, any, computer, system, for, example, a, system, that, stores, numeric, information, in, 16, bit, units, can, only, directly, represent, code, points, 0, to, 65, 535, in, each, unit, but, larger, code, points, say, 65, 536, to, 1, 4, million, could, be, represented, by, using, multiple, 16, bit, units, this, correspondence, is, defined, by, a, cef, a, character, encoding, scheme, ces, is, the, mapping, of, code, units, to, a, sequence, of, octets, to, facilitate, storage, on, an, octet, based, file, system, or, transmission, over, an, octet, based, network, simple, character, encoding, schemes, include, utf, 8, utf, 16be, utf, 32be, utf, 16le, and, utf, 32le, compound, character, encoding, schemes, such, as, utf, 16, utf, 32, and, iso, iec, 2022, switch, between, several, simple, schemes, by, using, a, byte, order, mark, or, escape, sequences, compressing, schemes, try, to, minimize, the, number, of, bytes, used, per, code, unit, such, as, scsu, and, bocu, although, utf, 32be, and, utf, 32le, are, simpler, ceses, most, systems, working, with, unicode, use, either, utf, 8, which, is, backward, compatible, with, fixed, length, ascii, and, maps, unicode, code, points, to, variable, length, sequences, of, octets, or, utf, 16be, which, is, backward, compatible, with, fixed, length, ucs, 2be, and, maps, unicode, code, points, to, variable, length, sequences, of, 16, bit, words, see, comparison, of, unicode, encodings, for, a, detailed, discussion, finally, there, may, be, a, higher, level, protocol, which, supplies, additional, information, to, select, the, particular, variant, of, a, unicode, character, particularly, where, there, are, regional, variants, that, have, been, unified, in, unicode, as, the, same, character, an, example, is, the, xml, attribute, xml, lang, the, unicode, model, uses, the, term, character, map, for, other, systems, which, directly, assign, a, sequence, of, characters, to, a, sequence, of, bytes, covering, all, of, the, ccs, cef, and, ces, layers, in, unicode, a, character, can, be, referred, to, as, u, followed, by, its, codepoint, value, in, hexadecimal, the, range, of, valid, code, points, the, codespace, for, the, unicode, standard, is, u, 0000, to, u, 10ffff, inclusive, divided, in, 17, planes, identified, by, the, numbers, 0, to, 16, characters, in, the, range, u, 0000, to, u, ffff, are, in, plane, 0, called, the, basic, multilingual, plane, bmp, this, plane, contains, most, commonly, used, characters, characters, in, the, range, u, 10000, to, u, 10ffff, in, the, other, planes, are, called, supplementary, characters, the, following, table, shows, examples, of, code, point, values, consider, a, string, of, the, letters, ab, c, that, is, a, string, containing, a, unicode, combining, character, u, 0332, combining, low, line, as, well, a, supplementary, character, u, 10400, deseret, capital, letter, long, i, this, string, has, several, unicode, representations, which, are, logically, equivalent, yet, while, each, is, suited, to, a, diverse, set, of, circumstances, or, range, of, requirements, note, in, particular, that, is, represented, with, either, one, 32, bit, value, utf, 32, two, 16, bit, values, utf, 16, or, four, 8, bit, values, utf, 8, although, each, of, those, forms, uses, the, same, total, number, of, bits, 32, to, represent, the, glyph, it, is, not, obvious, how, the, actual, numeric, byte, values, are, related, as, a, result, of, having, many, character, encoding, methods, in, use, and, the, need, for, backward, compatibility, with, archived, data, many, computer, programs, have, been, developed, to, translate, data, between, character, encoding, schemes, a, process, known, as, transcoding, some, of, these, are, cited, below, cross, platform, windows, the, most, used, character, encoding, on, the, web, is, utf, 8, used, in, 98, 2, of, surveyed, web, sites, as, of, may, 2024, in, application, programs, and, operating, system, tasks, both, utf, 8, and, utf, 16, are, popular, options
