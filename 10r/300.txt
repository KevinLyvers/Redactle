with, tall, buildings, self, supporting, structures, towers, are, specifically, distinguished, from, buildings, in, that, they, are, built, not, to, be, habitable, but, to, serve, other, functions, using, the, height, of, the, tower, for, example, the, height, of, a, clock, tower, improves, the, visibility, of, the, clock, and, the, height, of, a, tower, in, a, fortified, building, such, as, a, castle, increases, the, visibility, of, the, surroundings, for, defensive, purposes, towers, may, also, be, built, for, observation, leisure, or, telecommunication, purposes, a, tower, can, stand,

connected, with, the, ethnonym, as, well, as, with, tusci, from, turs, ci, the, greek, and, latin, names, for, the, etruscans, kretschmer, glotta, 22, 110ff, towers, have, been, used, by, humankind, since, prehistoric, times, the, oldest, known, may, be, the, circular, stone, tower, in, walls, of, neolithic, jericho, 8000, bc, some, of, the, earliest, towers, were, ziggurats, which, existed, in, sumerian, architecture, since, the, 4th, millennium, bc, the, most, famous, ziggurats, include, the, sumerian, ziggurat, of, ur, built, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, and, the, etemenanki, one, of, the, most, famous, examples, of, babylonian, architecture, some, of, the, earliest, surviving, examples, are, the, broch, structures, in, northern, scotland, which, are, conical, tower, houses, these, and, other, examples, from, phoenician, and, roman, cultures, emphasised, the, use, of, a, tower, in, fortification, and, sentinel, roles, for, example, the, name, of, the, moroccan, city, of, mogador, founded, in, the, first, millennium, bc, is, derived, from, the, phoenician, word, for, watchtower, migdol, the, romans, utilised, octagonal, towers, as, elements, of, diocletian, s, palace, in, croatia, which, monument, dates, to, approximately, 300, ad, while, the, servian, walls, 4th, century, bc, and, the, aurelian, walls, 3rd, century, ad, featured, square, ones, the, chinese, used, towers, as, integrated, elements, of, the, great, wall, of, china, in, 210, bc, during, the, qin, dynasty, towers, were, also, an, important, element, of, castles, other, well, known, towers, include, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, in, pisa, italy, built, from, 1173, until, 1372, the, two, towers, in, bologna, italy, built, from, 1109, until, 1119, and, the, towers, of, pavia, 25, survive, built,

be, made, with, the, supporting, structure, with, parallel, sides, however, above, a, certain, height, the, compressive, load, of, the, material, is, exceeded, and, the, tower, will, fail, this, can, be, avoided, if, the, tower, s, support, structure, tapers, up, the, building, a, second, limit, is, that, of, buckling, the, structure, requires, sufficient, stiffness, to, avoid, breaking, under, the, loads, it, faces, especially, those, due, to, winds, many, very, tall, towers, have, their, support, structures, at, the, periphery, of, the, building, which, greatly, increases, the, overall, stiffness, a, third, limit, is, dynamic, a, tower, is, subject, to, varying, winds, vortex, shedding, seismic, disturbances, etc, these, are, often, dealt, with, through, a, combination, of, simple, strength, and, stiffness, as, well, as, in, some, cases, tuned, mass, dampers, to, damp, out, movements, varying, or, tapering, the, outer, aspect, of, the, tower, with, height, avoids, vibrations, due, to, vortex, shedding, occurring, along, the, entire, building, simultaneously, although, not, correctly, defined, as, towers, many, modern, high, rise, buildings, in, particular, skyscraper, have, tower, in, their, name, or, are, colloquially, called, towers, skyscrapers, are, more, properly, classified, as, buildings, in, the, united, kingdom, tall, domestic, buildings, are, referred, to, as, tower, blocks, in, the, united, states, the, original, world, trade, center, had, the, nickname, the, twin, towers, a, name, shared, with, the, petronas, twin, towers, in, kuala, lumpur, in, addition, some, of, the, structures, listed, below, do, not, follow, the, strict, criteria, used, at, list, of, tallest, towers, the, tower, throughout, history, has, provided, its, users, with, an, advantage, in, surveying, defensive, positions, and, obtaining, a, better, view, of, the, surrounding, areas, including, battlefields, they, were, constructed, on, defensive, walls, or, rolled, near, a, target, see, siege, tower, today, strategic, use, towers, are, still, used, at, prisons, military, camps, and, defensive, perimeters, by, using, gravity, to, move, objects, or, substances, downward, a, tower, can, be, used, to, store, items, or, liquids, like, a, storage, silo, or, a, water, tower, or, aim, an, object, into, the, earth, such, as, a, drilling, tower, ski, jump, ramps, use, the, same, idea, and, in, the, absence, of, a, natural, mountain, slope, or, hill, can, be, human, made, in, history, simple, towers, like, lighthouses, bell, towers, clock, towers, signal, towers, and, minarets, were, used, to, communicate, information, over, greater, distances, in, more, recent, years, radio, masts, and, cell, phone, towers, facilitate, communication, by, expanding, the, range, of, the, transmitter, the, cn, tower, in, toronto, ontario, canada, was, built, as, a, communications, tower, with, the, capability, to, act, as, both, a, transmitter, and, repeater, towers, can, also, be, used, to, support, bridges, and, can, reach, heights, that, rival, some, of, the, tallest, buildings, above, water, their, use, is, most, prevalent, in, suspension, bridges, and, cable, stayed, bridges, the, use, of, the, pylon, a, simple, tower, structure, has, also, helped, to, build, railroad, bridges, mass, transit, systems, and, harbors, control, towers, are, used, to, give, visibility, to, help, direct, aviation, traffic, the, term, tower, is, also, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, firefighting, equipment, with, an, extremely, tall, ladder, designed, for, use, in, firefighting, rescue, operations, involving, high, rise, buildings
