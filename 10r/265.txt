welding, is, a, fabrication, process, that, joins, materials, usually, metals, or, thermoplastics, primarily, by, using, high, temperature, to, melt, the, parts, together, and, allow, them, to, cool, causing, fusion, common, alternative, methods, include, solvent, welding, of, thermoplastics, using, chemicals, to, melt, materials, being, bonded, without, heat, and, solid, state, welding, processes, which, bond, without, melting, such, as, pressure, cold, welding, and, diffusion, bonding, metal, welding, is, distinct, from, lower, temperature, bonding, techniques, such, as, brazing, and, soldering, which, do, not, melt, the, base, metal, parent, metal, and, instead, require, flowing, a, filler, metal, to, solidify, their, bonds, in, addition, to, melting, the, base, metal, in, welding, a, filler, material, is, typically, added, to, the, joint, to, form, a, pool, of, molten, material, the, weld, pool, that, cools, to, form, a, joint, that, can, be, stronger, than, the, base, material, welding, also, requires, a, form, of, shield, to, protect, the, filler, metals, or, melted, metals, from, being, contaminated, or, oxidized, many, different, energy, sources, can, be, used, for, welding, including, a, gas, flame, chemical, an, electric, arc, electrical, a, laser, an, electron, beam, friction, and, ultrasound, while, often, an, industrial, process, welding, may, be, performed, in, many, different, environments, including, in, open, air, under, water, and, in, outer, space, welding, is, a, hazardous, undertaking, and, precautions, are, required, to, avoid, burns, electric, shock, vision, damage, inhalation, of, poisonous, gases, and, fumes, and, exposure, to, intense, ultraviolet, radiation, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, only, welding, process, was, forge, welding, which, blacksmiths, had, used, for, millennia, to, join, iron, and, steel, by, heating, and, hammering, arc, welding, and, oxy, fuel, welding, were, among, the, first, processes, to, develop, late, in, the, century, and, electric, resistance, welding, followed, soon, after, welding, technology, advanced, quickly, during, the, early, 20th, century, as, world, wars, drove, the, demand, for, reliable, and, inexpensive, joining, methods, following, the, wars, several, modern, welding, techniques, were, developed, including, manual, methods, like, shielded, metal, arc, welding, now, one, of, the, most, popular, welding, methods, as, well, as, semi, automatic, and, automatic, processes, such, as, gas, metal, arc, welding, submerged, arc, welding, flux, cored, arc, welding, and, electroslag, welding, developments, continued, with, the, invention, of, laser, beam, welding, electron, beam, welding, magnetic, pulse, welding, and, friction, stir, welding, in, the, latter, half, of, the, century, today, as, the, science, continues, to, advance, robot, welding, is, commonplace, in, industrial, settings, and, researchers, continue, to, develop, new, welding, methods, and, gain, greater, understanding, of, weld, quality, the, term, weld, is, derived, from, the, middle, english, verb, well, w, ll, plural, present, tense, w, lle, or, welling, w, llen, meaning, to, heat, to, the, maximum, temperature, possible, to, bring, to, a, boil, the, modern, word, was, probably, derived, from, the, past, tense, participle, welled, w, llende, with, the, addition, of, d, for, this, purpose, being, common, in, the, germanic, languages, of, the, angles, and, saxons, it, was, first, recorded, in, english, in, 1590, a, fourteenth, century, translation, of, the, christian, bible, into, english, by, john, wycliffe, translates, isaiah, 2, 4, as, thei, shul, bete, togidere, their, swerdes, into, shares, they, shall, beat, together, their, swords, into, plowshares, in, the, 1590, version, this, was, changed, to, thei, shullen, welle, togidere, her, swerdes, in, to, scharris, they, shall, weld, together, their, swords, into, plowshares, suggesting, this, particular, use, of, the, word, probably, became, popular, in, english, sometime, between, these, periods, the, old, english, word, for, welding, iron, was, samod, to, bring, together, or, samodwellung, to, bring, together, hot, the, word, is, related, to, the, old, swedish, word, valla, meaning, to, boil, which, could, refer, to, joining, metals, as, in, valla, j, rn, literally, to, boil, iron, sweden, was, a, large, exporter, of, iron, during, the, middle, ages, so, the, word, may, have, entered, english, from, the, swedish, iron, trade, or, may, have, been, imported, with, the, thousands, of, viking, settlements, that, arrived, in, england, before, and, during, the, viking, age, as, more, than, half, of, the, most, common, english, words, in, everyday, use, are, scandinavian, in, origin, the, history, of, joining, metals, goes, back, several, millennia, the, earliest, examples, of, this, come, from, the, bronze, and, iron, ages, in, europe, and, the, middle, east, the, ancient, greek, historian, herodotus, states, in, the, histories, of, the, 5th, century, bc, that, glaucus, of, chios, was, the, man, who, single, handedly, invented, iron, welding, forge, welding, was, used, in, the, construction, of, the, iron, pillar, of, delhi, erected, in, delhi, india, about, 310, ad, and, weighing, 5, 4, metric, tons, the, middle, ages, brought, advances, in, forge, welding, in, which, blacksmiths, pounded, heated, metal, repeatedly, until, bonding, occurred, in, 1540, vannoccio, biringuccio, published, de, la, pirotechnia, which, includes, descriptions, of, the, forging, operation, renaissance, craftsmen, were, skilled, in, the, process, and, the, industry, continued, to, grow, during, the, following, centuries, in, 1800, sir, humphry, davy, discovered, the, short, pulse, electrical, arc, and, presented, his, results, in, 1801, in, 1802, russian, scientist, vasily, petrov, created, the, continuous, electric, arc, and, subsequently, published, news, of, galvanic, voltaic, experiments, in, 1803, in, which, he, described, experiments, carried, out, in, 1802, of, great, importance, in, this, work, was, the, description, of, a, stable, arc, discharge, and, the, indication, of, its, possible, use, for, many, applications, one, being, melting, metals, in, 1808, davy, who, was, unaware, of, petrov, s, work, rediscovered, the, continuous, electric, arc, in, 1881, 82, inventors, nikolai, benardos, russian, and, stanis, aw, olszewski, polish, created, the, first, electric, arc, welding, method, known, as, carbon, arc, welding, using, carbon, electrodes, the, advances, in, arc, welding, continued, with, the, invention, of, metal, electrodes, in, the, late, 1800s, by, a, russian, nikolai, slavyanov, 1888, and, an, american, c, l, coffin, 1890, around, 1900, a, p, strohmenger, released, a, coated, metal, electrode, in, britain, which, gave, a, more, stable, arc, in, 1905, russian, scientist, vladimir, mitkevich, proposed, using, a, three, phase, electric, arc, for, welding, alternating, current, welding, was, invented, by, c, j, holslag, in, 1919, but, did, not, become, popular, for, another, decade, resistance, welding, was, also, developed, during, the, final, decades, of, the, 19th, century, with, the, first, patents, going, to, elihu, thomson, in, 1885, who, produced, further, advances, over, the, next, 15, years, thermite, welding, was, invented, in, 1893, and, around, that, time, another, process, oxyfuel, welding, became, well, established, acetylene, was, discovered, in, 1836, by, edmund, davy, but, its, use, was, not, practical, in, welding, until, about, 1900, when, a, suitable, torch, was, developed, at, first, oxyfuel, welding, was, one, of, the, more, popular, welding, methods, due, to, its, portability, and, relatively, low, cost, as, the, 20th, century, progressed, however, it, fell, out, of, favor, for, industrial, applications, it, was, largely, replaced, with, arc, welding, as, advances, in, metal, coverings, known, as, flux, were, made, flux, covering, the, electrode, primarily, shields, the, base, material, from, impurities, but, also, stabilizes, the, arc, and, can, add, alloying, components, to, the, weld, metal, world, war, i, caused, a, major, surge, in, the, use, of, welding, with, the, various, military, powers, attempting, to, determine, which, of, the, several, new, welding, processes, would, be, best, the, british, primarily, used, arc, welding, even, constructing, a, ship, the, fullagar, with, an, entirely, welded, hull, 142, arc, welding, was, first, applied, to, aircraft, during, the, war, as, well, as, some, german, airplane, fuselages, were, constructed, using, the, process, also, noteworthy, is, the, first, welded, road, bridge, in, the, world, the, maurzyce, bridge, in, poland, 1928, during, the, 1920s, significant, advances, were, made, in, welding, technology, including, the, introduction, of, automatic, welding, in, 1920, in, which, electrode, wire, was, fed, continuously, shielding, gas, became, a, subject, receiving, much, attention, as, scientists, attempted, to, protect, welds, from, the, effects, of, oxygen, and, nitrogen, in, the, atmosphere, porosity, and, brittleness, were, the, primary, problems, and, the, solutions, that, developed, included, the, use, of, hydrogen, argon, and, helium, as, welding, atmospheres, during, the, following, decade, further, advances, allowed, for, the, welding, of, reactive, metals, like, aluminum, and, magnesium, this, in, conjunction, with, developments, in, automatic, welding, alternating, current, and, fluxes, fed, a, major, expansion, of, arc, welding, during, the, 1930s, and, then, during, world, war, ii, in, 1930, the, first, all, welded, merchant, vessel, m, s, carolinian, was, launched, during, the, middle, of, the, century, many, new, welding, methods, were, invented, in, 1930, kyle, taylor, was, responsible, for, the, release, of, stud, welding, which, soon, became, popular, in, shipbuilding, and, construction, submerged, arc, welding, was, invented, the, same, year, and, continues, to, be, popular, today, in, 1932, a, russian, konstantin, khrenov, eventually, implemented, the, first, underwater, electric, arc, welding, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, after, decades, of, development, was, finally, perfected, in, 1941, and, gas, metal, arc, welding, followed, in, 1948, allowing, for, fast, welding, of, non, ferrous, materials, but, requiring, expensive, shielding, gases, shielded, metal, arc, welding, was, developed, during, the, 1950s, using, a, flux, coated, consumable, electrode, and, it, quickly, became, the, most, popular, metal, arc, welding, process, in, 1957, the, flux, cored, arc, welding, process, debuted, in, which, the, self, shielded, wire, electrode, could, be, used, with, automatic, equipment, resulting, in, greatly, increased, welding, speeds, and, that, same, year, plasma, arc, welding, was, invented, by, robert, gage, electroslag, welding, was, introduced, in, 1958, and, it, was, followed, by, its, cousin, electrogas, welding, in, 1961, in, 1953, the, soviet, scientist, n, f, kazakov, proposed, the, diffusion, bonding, method, other, recent, developments, in, welding, include, the, 1958, breakthrough, of, electron, beam, welding, making, deep, and, narrow, welding, possible, through, the, concentrated, heat, source, following, the, invention, of, the, laser, in, 1960, laser, beam, welding, debuted, several, decades, later, and, has, proved, to, be, especially, useful, in, high, speed, automated, welding, magnetic, pulse, welding, mpw, has, been, industrially, used, since, 1967, friction, stir, welding, was, invented, in, 1991, by, wayne, thomas, at, the, welding, institute, twi, uk, and, found, high, quality, applications, all, over, the, world, all, of, these, four, new, processes, continue, to, be, quite, expensive, due, to, the, high, cost, of, the, necessary, equipment, and, this, has, limited, their, applications, the, most, common, gas, welding, process, is, oxyfuel, welding, also, known, as, oxyacetylene, welding, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, versatile, welding, processes, but, in, recent, years, it, has, become, less, popular, in, industrial, applications, it, is, still, widely, used, for, welding, pipes, and, tubes, as, well, as, repair, work, the, equipment, is, relatively, inexpensive, and, simple, generally, employing, the, combustion, of, acetylene, in, oxygen, to, produce, a, welding, flame, temperature, of, about, 3100, c, 5600, f, the, flame, since, it, is, less, concentrated, than, an, electric, arc, causes, slower, weld, cooling, which, can, lead, to, greater, residual, stresses, and, weld, distortion, though, it, eases, the, welding, of, high, alloy, steels, a, similar, process, generally, called, oxyfuel, cutting, is, used, to, cut, metals, these, processes, use, a, welding, power, supply, to, create, and, maintain, an, electric, arc, between, an, electrode, and, the, base, material, to, melt, metals, at, the, welding, point, they, can, use, either, direct, current, dc, or, alternating, current, ac, and, consumable, or, non, consumable, electrodes, the, welding, region, is, sometimes, protected, by, some, type, of, inert, or, semi, inert, gas, known, as, a, shielding, gas, and, filler, material, is, sometimes, used, as, well, one, of, the, most, common, types, of, arc, welding, is, shielded, metal, arc, welding, smaw, it, is, also, known, as, manual, metal, arc, welding, mmaw, or, stick, welding, electric, current, is, used, to, strike, an, arc, between, the, base, material, and, consumable, electrode, rod, which, is, made, of, filler, material, typical, steel, and, is, covered, with, a, flux, that, protects, the, weld, area, from, oxidation, and, contamination, by, producing, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, gas, during, the, welding, process, the, electrode, core, itself, acts, as, filler, material, making, a, separate, filler, unnecessary, the, process, is, versatile, and, can, be, performed, with, relatively, inexpensive, equipment, making, it, well, suited, to, shop, jobs, and, field, work, an, operator, can, become, reasonably, proficient, with, a, modest, amount, of, training, and, can, achieve, mastery, with, experience, weld, times, are, rather, slow, since, the, consumable, electrodes, must, be, frequently, replaced, and, because, slag, the, residue, from, the, flux, must, be, chipped, away, after, welding, furthermore, the, process, is, generally, limited, to, welding, ferrous, materials, though, special, electrodes, have, made, possible, the, welding, of, cast, iron, stainless, steel, aluminum, and, other, metals, gas, metal, arc, welding, gmaw, also, known, as, metal, inert, gas, or, mig, welding, is, a, semi, automatic, or, automatic, process, that, uses, a, continuous, wire, feed, as, an, electrode, and, an, inert, or, semi, inert, gas, mixture, to, protect, the, weld, from, contamination, since, the, electrode, is, continuous, welding, speeds, are, greater, for, gmaw, than, for, smaw, a, related, process, flux, cored, arc, welding, fcaw, uses, similar, equipment, but, uses, wire, consisting, of, a, steel, electrode, surrounding, a, powder, fill, material, this, cored, wire, is, more, expensive, than, the, standard, solid, wire, and, can, generate, fumes, and, or, slag, but, it, permits, even, higher, welding, speed, and, greater, metal, penetration, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, gtaw, or, tungsten, inert, gas, tig, welding, is, a, manual, welding, process, that, uses, a, non, consumable, tungsten, electrode, an, inert, or, semi, inert, gas, mixture, and, a, separate, filler, material, especially, useful, for, welding, thin, materials, this, method, is, characterized, by, a, stable, arc, and, high, quality, welds, but, it, requires, significant, operator, skill, and, can, only, be, accomplished, at, relatively, low, speeds, gtaw, can, be, used, on, nearly, all, weldable, metals, though, it, is, most, often, applied, to, stainless, steel, and, light, metals, it, is, often, used, when, quality, welds, are, extremely, important, such, as, in, bicycle, aircraft, and, naval, applications, a, related, process, plasma, arc, welding, also, uses, a, tungsten, electrode, but, uses, plasma, gas, to, make, the, arc, the, arc, is, more, concentrated, than, the, gtaw, arc, making, transverse, control, more, critical, and, thus, generally, restricting, the, technique, to, a, mechanized, process, because, of, its, stable, current, the, method, can, be, used, on, a, wider, range, of, material, thicknesses, than, can, the, gtaw, process, and, it, is, much, faster, it, can, be, applied, to, all, of, the, same, materials, as, gtaw, except, magnesium, and, automated, welding, of, stainless, steel, is, one, important, application, of, the, process, a, variation, of, the, process, is, plasma, cutting, an, efficient, steel, cutting, process, submerged, arc, welding, saw, is, a, high, productivity, welding, method, in, which, the, arc, is, struck, beneath, a, covering, layer, of, flux, this, increases, arc, quality, since, contaminants, in, the, atmosphere, are, blocked, by, the, flux, the, slag, that, forms, on, the, weld, generally, comes, off, by, itself, and, combined, with, the, use, of, a, continuous, wire, feed, the, weld, deposition, rate, is, high, working, conditions, are, much, improved, over, other, arc, welding, processes, since, the, flux, hides, the, arc, and, almost, no, smoke, is, produced, the, process, is, commonly, used, in, industry, especially, for, large, products, and, in, the, manufacture, of, welded, pressure, vessels, other, arc, welding, processes, include, atomic, hydrogen, welding, electroslag, welding, esw, electrogas, welding, and, stud, arc, welding, esw, is, a, highly, productive, single, pass, welding, process, for, thicker, materials, between, 1, inch, 25, mm, and, 12, inches, 300, mm, in, a, vertical, or, close, to, vertical, position, to, supply, the, electrical, power, necessary, for, arc, welding, processes, a, variety, of, different, power, supplies, can, be, used, the, most, common, welding, power, supplies, are, constant, current, power, supplies, and, constant, voltage, power, supplies, in, arc, welding, the, length, of, the, arc, is, directly, related, to, the, voltage, and, the, amount, of, heat, input, is, related, to, the, current, constant, current, power, supplies, are, most, often, used, for, manual, welding, processes, such, as, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, and, shielded, metal, arc, welding, because, they, maintain, a, relatively, constant, current, even, as, the, voltage, varies, this, is, important, because, in, manual, welding, it, can, be, difficult, to, hold, the, electrode, perfectly, steady, and, as, a, result, the, arc, length, and, thus, voltage, tend, to, fluctuate, constant, voltage, power, supplies, hold, the, voltage, constant, and, vary, the, current, and, as, a, result, are, most, often, used, for, automated, welding, processes, such, as, gas, metal, arc, welding, flux, cored, arc, welding, and, submerged, arc, welding, in, these, processes, arc, length, is, kept, constant, since, any, fluctuation, in, the, distance, between, the, wire, and, the, base, material, is, quickly, rectified, by, a, large, change, in, current, for, example, if, the, wire, and, the, base, material, get, too, close, the, current, will, rapidly, increase, which, in, turn, causes, the, heat, to, increase, and, the, tip, of, the, wire, to, melt, returning, it, to, its, original, separation, distance, the, type, of, current, used, plays, an, important, role, in, arc, welding, consumable, electrode, processes, such, as, shielded, metal, arc, welding, and, gas, metal, arc, welding, generally, use, direct, current, but, the, electrode, can, be, charged, either, positively, or, negatively, in, welding, the, positively, charged, anode, will, have, a, greater, heat, concentration, and, as, a, result, changing, the, polarity, of, the, electrode, affects, weld, properties, if, the, electrode, is, positively, charged, the, base, metal, will, be, hotter, increasing, weld, penetration, and, welding, speed, alternatively, a, negatively, charged, electrode, results, in, more, shallow, welds, non, consumable, electrode, processes, such, as, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, can, use, either, type, of, direct, current, as, well, as, alternating, current, however, with, direct, current, because, the, electrode, only, creates, the, arc, and, does, not, provide, filler, material, a, positively, charged, electrode, causes, shallow, welds, while, a, negatively, charged, electrode, makes, deeper, welds, alternating, current, rapidly, moves, between, these, two, resulting, in, medium, penetration, welds, one, disadvantage, of, ac, the, fact, that, the, arc, must, be, re, ignited, after, every, zero, crossings, has, been, addressed, with, the, invention, of, special, power, units, that, produce, a, square, wave, pattern, instead, of, the, normal, sine, wave, making, rapid, zero, crossings, possible, and, minimizing, the, effects, of, the, problem, resistance, welding, involves, the, generation, of, heat, by, passing, current, through, the, resistance, caused, by, the, contact, between, two, or, more, metal, surfaces, small, pools, of, molten, metal, are, formed, at, the, weld, area, as, high, current, 1, 000, 100, 000, a, is, passed, through, the, metal, in, general, resistance, welding, methods, are, efficient, and, cause, little, pollution, but, their, applications, are, somewhat, limited, and, the, equipment, cost, can, be, high, spot, welding, is, a, popular, resistance, welding, method, used, to, join, overlapping, metal, sheets, of, up, to, 3, mm, thick, two, electrodes, are, simultaneously, used, to, clamp, the, metal, sheets, together, and, to, pass, current, through, the, sheets, the, advantages, of, the, method, include, efficient, energy, use, limited, workpiece, deformation, high, production, rates, easy, automation, and, no, required, filler, materials, weld, strength, is, significantly, lower, than, with, other, welding, methods, making, the, process, suitable, for, only, certain, applications, it, is, used, extensively, in, the, automotive, industry, ordinary, cars, can, have, several, thousand, spot, welds, made, by, industrial, robots, a, specialized, process, called, shot, welding, can, be, used, to, spot, weld, stainless, steel, like, spot, welding, seam, welding, relies, on, two, electrodes, to, apply, pressure, and, current, to, join, metal, sheets, however, instead, of, pointed, electrodes, wheel, shaped, electrodes, roll, along, and, often, feed, the, workpiece, making, it, possible, to, make, long, continuous, welds, in, the, past, this, process, was, used, in, the, manufacture, of, beverage, cans, but, now, its, uses, are, more, limited, other, resistance, welding, methods, include, butt, welding, flash, welding, projection, welding, and, upset, welding, energy, beam, welding, methods, namely, laser, beam, welding, and, electron, beam, welding, are, relatively, new, processes, that, have, become, quite, popular, in, high, production, applications, the, two, processes, are, quite, similar, differing, most, notably, in, their, source, of, power, laser, beam, welding, employs, a, highly, focused, laser, beam, while, electron, beam, welding, is, done, in, a, vacuum, and, uses, an, electron, beam, both, have, a, very, high, energy, density, making, deep, weld, penetration, possible, and, minimizing, the, size, of, the, weld, area, both, processes, are, extremely, fast, and, are, easily, automated, making, them, highly, productive, the, primary, disadvantages, are, their, very, high, equipment, costs, though, these, are, decreasing, and, a, susceptibility, to, thermal, cracking, developments, in, this, area, include, laser, hybrid, welding, which, uses, principles, from, both, laser, beam, welding, and, arc, welding, for, even, better, weld, properties, laser, cladding, and, x, ray, welding, like, forge, welding, the, earliest, welding, process, discovered, some, modern, welding, methods, do, not, involve, the, melting, of, the, materials, being, joined, one, of, the, most, popular, ultrasonic, welding, is, used, to, connect, thin, sheets, or, wires, made, of, metal, or, thermoplastic, by, vibrating, them, at, high, frequency, and, under, high, pressure, the, equipment, and, methods, involved, are, similar, to, that, of, resistance, welding, but, instead, of, electric, current, vibration, provides, energy, input, when, welding, metals, the, vibrations, are, introduced, horizontally, and, the, materials, are, not, melted, with, plastics, which, should, have, similar, melting, temperatures, vertically, ultrasonic, welding, is, commonly, used, for, making, electrical, connections, out, of, aluminum, or, copper, and, it, is, also, a, very, common, polymer, welding, process, another, common, process, explosion, welding, involves, the, joining, of, materials, by, pushing, them, together, under, extremely, high, pressure, the, energy, from, the, impact, plasticizes, the, materials, forming, a, weld, even, though, only, a, limited, amount, of, heat, is, generated, the, process, is, commonly, used, for, welding, dissimilar, materials, including, bonding, aluminum, to, carbon, steel, in, ship, hulls, and, stainless, steel, or, titanium, to, carbon, steel, in, petrochemical, pressure, vessels, other, solid, state, welding, processes, include, friction, welding, including, friction, stir, welding, and, friction, stir, spot, welding, magnetic, pulse, welding, co, extrusion, welding, cold, welding, diffusion, bonding, exothermic, welding, high, frequency, welding, hot, pressure, welding, induction, welding, and, roll, bonding, welds, can, be, geometrically, prepared, in, many, different, ways, the, five, basic, types, of, weld, joints, are, the, butt, joint, lap, joint, corner, joint, edge, joint, and, t, joint, a, variant, of, this, last, is, the, cruciform, joint, other, variations, exist, as, well, for, example, double, v, preparation, joints, are, characterized, by, the, two, pieces, of, material, each, tapering, to, a, single, center, point, at, one, half, their, height, single, u, and, double, u, preparation, joints, are, also, fairly, common, instead, of, having, straight, edges, like, the, single, v, and, double, v, preparation, joints, they, are, curved, forming, the, shape, of, a, u, lap, joints, are, also, commonly, more, than, two, pieces, thick, depending, on, the, process, used, and, the, thickness, of, the, material, many, pieces, can, be, welded, together, in, a, lap, joint, geometry, many, welding, processes, require, the, use, of, a, particular, joint, design, for, example, resistance, spot, welding, laser, beam, welding, and, electron, beam, welding, are, most, frequently, performed, on, lap, joints, other, welding, methods, like, shielded, metal, arc, welding, are, extremely, versatile, and, can, weld, virtually, any, type, of, joint, some, processes, can, also, be, used, to, make, multipass, welds, in, which, one, weld, is, allowed, to, cool, and, then, another, weld, is, performed, on, top, of, it, this, allows, for, the, welding, of, thick, sections, arranged, in, a, single, v, preparation, joint, for, example, after, welding, a, number, of, distinct, regions, can, be, identified, in, the, weld, area, the, weld, itself, is, called, the, fusion, zone, more, specifically, it, is, where, the, filler, metal, was, laid, during, the, welding, process, the, properties, of, the, fusion, zone, depend, primarily, on, the, filler, metal, used, and, its, compatibility, with, the, base, materials, it, is, surrounded, by, the, heat, affected, zone, the, area, that, had, its, microstructure, and, properties, altered, by, the, weld, these, properties, depend, on, the, base, material, s, behavior, when, subjected, to, heat, the, metal, in, this, area, is, often, weaker, than, both, the, base, material, and, the, fusion, zone, and, is, also, where, residual, stresses, are, found, many, distinct, factors, influence, the, strength, of, welds, and, the, material, around, them, including, the, welding, method, the, amount, and, concentration, of, energy, input, the, weldability, of, the, base, material, filler, material, and, flux, material, the, design, of, the, joint, and, the, interactions, between, all, these, factors, for, example, the, factor, of, welding, position, influences, weld, quality, that, welding, codes, specifications, may, require, testing, both, welding, procedures, and, welders, using, specified, welding, positions, 1g, flat, 2g, horizontal, 3g, vertical, 4g, overhead, 5g, horizontal, fixed, pipe, or, 6g, inclined, fixed, pipe, to, test, the, quality, of, a, weld, either, destructive, or, nondestructive, testing, methods, are, commonly, used, to, verify, that, welds, are, free, of, defects, have, acceptable, levels, of, residual, stresses, and, distortion, and, have, acceptable, heat, affected, zone, haz, properties, types, of, welding, defects, include, cracks, distortion, gas, inclusions, porosity, non, metallic, inclusions, lack, of, fusion, incomplete, penetration, lamellar, tearing, and, undercutting, the, metalworking, industry, has, instituted, codes, and, specifications, to, guide, welders, weld, inspectors, engineers, managers, and, property, owners, in, proper, welding, technique, design, of, welds, how, to, judge, the, quality, of, welding, procedure, specification, how, to, judge, the, skill, of, the, person, performing, the, weld, and, how, to, ensure, the, quality, of, a, welding, job, methods, such, as, visual, inspection, radiography, ultrasonic, testing, phased, array, ultrasonics, dye, penetrant, inspection, magnetic, particle, inspection, or, industrial, computed, tomography, can, help, with, detection, and, analysis, of, certain, defects, the, heat, affected, zone, haz, is, a, ring, surrounding, the, weld, in, which, the, temperature, of, the, welding, process, combined, with, the, stresses, of, uneven, heating, and, cooling, alters, the, heat, treatment, properties, of, the, alloy, the, effects, of, welding, on, the, material, surrounding, the, weld, can, be, detrimental, depending, on, the, materials, used, and, the, heat, input, of, the, welding, process, used, the, haz, can, be, of, varying, size, and, strength, the, thermal, diffusivity, of, the, base, material, plays, a, large, role, if, the, diffusivity, is, high, the, material, cooling, rate, is, high, and, the, haz, is, relatively, small, conversely, a, low, diffusivity, leads, to, slower, cooling, and, a, larger, haz, the, amount, of, heat, injected, by, the, welding, process, plays, an, important, role, as, well, as, processes, like, oxyacetylene, welding, have, an, unconcentrated, heat, input, and, increase, the, size, of, the, haz, processes, like, laser, beam, welding, give, a, highly, concentrated, limited, amount, of, heat, resulting, in, a, small, haz, arc, welding, falls, between, these, two, extremes, with, the, individual, processes, varying, somewhat, in, heat, input, to, calculate, the, heat, input, for, arc, welding, procedures, the, following, formula, can, be, used, where, q, heat, input, kj, mm, v, voltage, v, i, current, a, and, s, welding, speed, mm, min, the, efficiency, is, dependent, on, the, welding, process, used, with, shielded, metal, arc, welding, having, a, value, of, 0, 75, gas, metal, arc, welding, and, submerged, arc, welding, 0, 9, and, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, 0, 8, methods, of, alleviating, the, stresses, and, brittleness, created, in, the, haz, include, stress, relieving, and, tempering, one, major, defect, concerning, the, haz, would, be, cracking, at, the, toes, due, to, the, rapid, expansion, heating, and, contraction, cooling, the, material, may, not, have, the, ability, to, withstand, the, stress, and, could, cause, cracking, one, method, the, control, these, stress, would, be, to, control, the, heating, and, cooling, rate, such, as, pre, heating, and, post, heating, the, durability, and, life, of, dynamically, loaded, welded, steel, structures, is, determined, in, many, cases, by, the, welds, in, particular, the, weld, transitions, through, selective, treatment, of, the, transitions, by, grinding, abrasive, cutting, shot, peening, high, frequency, impact, treatment, ultrasonic, impact, treatment, etc, the, durability, of, many, designs, increases, significantly, most, solids, used, are, engineering, materials, consisting, of, crystalline, solids, in, which, the, atoms, or, ions, are, arranged, in, a, repetitive, geometric, pattern, which, is, known, as, a, lattice, structure, the, only, exception, is, material, that, is, made, from, glass, which, is, a, combination, of, a, supercooled, liquid, and, polymers, which, are, aggregates, of, large, organic, molecules, crystalline, solids, cohesion, is, obtained, by, a, metallic, or, chemical, bond, that, is, formed, between, the, constituent, atoms, chemical, bonds, can, be, grouped, into, two, types, consisting, of, ionic, and, covalent, to, form, an, ionic, bond, either, a, valence, or, bonding, electron, separates, from, one, atom, and, becomes, attached, to, another, atom, to, form, oppositely, charged, ions, the, bonding, in, the, static, position, is, when, the, ions, occupy, an, equilibrium, position, where, the, resulting, force, between, them, is, zero, when, the, ions, are, exerted, in, tension, force, the, inter, ionic, spacing, increases, creating, an, electrostatic, attractive, force, while, a, repulsing, force, under, compressive, force, between, the, atomic, nuclei, is, dominant, covalent, bonding, takes, place, when, one, of, the, constituent, atoms, loses, one, or, more, electrons, with, the, other, atom, gaining, the, electrons, resulting, in, an, electron, cloud, that, is, shared, by, the, molecule, as, a, whole, in, both, ionic, and, covalent, bonding, the, location, of, the, ions, and, electrons, are, constrained, relative, to, each, other, thereby, resulting, in, the, bond, being, characteristically, brittle, metallic, bonding, can, be, classified, as, a, type, of, covalent, bonding, for, which, the, constituent, atoms, are, of, the, same, type, and, do, not, combine, with, one, another, to, form, a, chemical, bond, atoms, will, lose, an, electron, s, forming, an, array, of, positive, ions, these, electrons, are, shared, by, the, lattice, which, makes, the, electron, cluster, mobile, as, the, electrons, are, free, to, move, as, well, as, the, ions, for, this, it, gives, metals, their, relatively, high, thermal, and, electrical, conductivity, as, well, as, being, characteristically, ductile, three, of, the, most, commonly, used, crystal, lattice, structures, in, metals, are, the, body, centred, cubic, face, centred, cubic, and, close, packed, hexagonal, ferritic, steel, has, a, body, centred, cubic, structure, and, austenitic, steel, non, ferrous, metals, like, aluminium, copper, and, nickel, have, the, face, centred, cubic, structure, ductility, is, an, important, factor, in, ensuring, the, integrity, of, structures, by, enabling, them, to, sustain, local, stress, concentrations, without, fracture, in, addition, structures, are, required, to, be, of, an, acceptable, strength, which, is, related, to, a, material, s, yield, strength, in, general, as, the, yield, strength, of, a, material, increases, there, is, a, corresponding, reduction, in, fracture, toughness, a, reduction, in, fracture, toughness, may, also, be, attributed, to, the, embrittlement, effect, of, impurities, or, for, body, centred, cubic, metals, from, a, reduction, in, temperature, metals, and, in, particular, steels, have, a, transitional, temperature, range, where, above, this, range, the, metal, has, acceptable, notch, ductility, while, below, this, range, the, material, becomes, brittle, within, the, range, the, materials, behavior, is, unpredictable, the, reduction, in, fracture, toughness, is, accompanied, by, a, change, in, the, fracture, appearance, when, above, the, transition, the, fracture, is, primarily, due, to, micro, void, coalescence, which, results, in, the, fracture, appearing, fibrous, when, the, temperatures, falls, the, fracture, will, show, signs, of, cleavage, facets, these, two, appearances, are, visible, by, the, naked, eye, brittle, fracture, in, steel, plates, may, appear, as, chevron, markings, under, the, microscope, these, arrow, like, ridges, on, the, crack, surface, point, towards, the, origin, of, the, fracture, fracture, toughness, is, measured, using, a, notched, and, pre, cracked, rectangular, specimen, of, which, the, dimensions, are, specified, in, standards, for, example, astm, e23, there, are, other, means, of, estimating, or, measuring, fracture, toughness, by, the, following, the, charpy, impact, test, per, astm, a370, the, crack, tip, opening, displacement, ctod, test, per, bs, 7448, 1, the, j, integral, test, per, astm, e1820, the, pellini, drop, weight, test, per, astm, e208, while, many, welding, applications, are, done, in, controlled, environments, such, as, factories, and, repair, shops, some, welding, processes, are, commonly, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, conditions, such, as, open, air, underwater, and, vacuums, such, as, space, in, open, air, applications, such, as, construction, and, outdoors, repair, shielded, metal, arc, welding, is, the, most, common, process, processes, that, employ, inert, gases, to, protect, the, weld, cannot, be, readily, used, in, such, situations, because, unpredictable, atmospheric, movements, can, result, in, a, faulty, weld, shielded, metal, arc, welding, is, also, often, used, in, underwater, welding, in, the, construction, and, repair, of, ships, offshore, platforms, and, pipelines, but, others, such, as, flux, cored, arc, welding, and, gas, tungsten, arc, welding, are, also, common, welding, in, space, is, also, possible, it, was, first, attempted, in, 1969, by, russian, cosmonauts, during, the, soyuz, 6, mission, when, they, performed, experiments, to, test, shielded, metal, arc, welding, plasma, arc, welding, and, electron, beam, welding, in, a, depressurized, environment, further, testing, of, these, methods, was, done, in, the, following, decades, and, today, researchers, continue, to, develop, methods, for, using, other, welding, processes, in, space, such, as, laser, beam, welding, resistance, welding, and, friction, welding, advances, in, these, areas, may, be, useful, for, future, endeavours, similar, to, the, construction, of, the, international, space, station, which, could, rely, on, welding, for, joining, in, space, the, parts, that, were, manufactured, on, earth, welding, can, be, dangerous, and, unhealthy, if, the, proper, precautions, are, not, taken, however, using, new, technology, and, proper, protection, greatly, reduces, risks, of, injury, and, death, associated, with, welding, since, many, common, welding, procedures, involve, an, open, electric, arc, or, flame, the, risk, of, burns, and, fire, is, significant, this, is, why, it, is, classified, as, a, hot, work, process, to, prevent, injury, welders, wear, personal, protective, equipment, in, the, form, of, heavy, leather, gloves, and, protective, long, sleeve, jackets, to, avoid, exposure, to, extreme, heat, and, flames, synthetic, clothing, such, as, polyester, should, not, be, worn, since, it, may, burn, causing, injury, additionally, the, brightness, of, the, weld, area, leads, to, a, condition, called, arc, eye, or, flash, burns, in, which, ultraviolet, light, causes, inflammation, of, the, cornea, and, can, burn, the, retinas, of, the, eyes, goggles, and, welding, helmets, with, dark, uv, filtering, face, plates, are, worn, to, prevent, this, exposure, since, the, 2000s, some, helmets, have, included, a, face, plate, which, instantly, darkens, upon, exposure, to, the, intense, uv, light, to, protect, bystanders, the, welding, area, is, often, surrounded, with, translucent, welding, curtains, these, curtains, made, of, a, polyvinyl, chloride, plastic, film, shield, people, outside, the, welding, area, from, the, uv, light, of, the, electric, arc, but, cannot, replace, the, filter, glass, used, in, helmets, depending, on, the, type, of, material, welding, varieties, and, other, factors, welding, can, produce, over, 100, db, a, of, noise, long, term, or, continuous, exposure, to, higher, decibels, can, lead, to, noise, induced, hearing, loss, welders, are, often, exposed, to, dangerous, gases, and, particulate, matter, processes, like, flux, cored, arc, welding, and, shielded, metal, arc, welding, produce, smoke, containing, particles, of, various, types, of, oxides, the, size, of, the, particles, in, question, tends, to, influence, the, toxicity, of, the, fumes, with, smaller, particles, presenting, a, greater, danger, this, is, because, smaller, particles, have, the, ability, to, cross, the, blood, brain, barrier, fumes, and, gases, such, as, carbon, dioxide, ozone, and, fumes, containing, heavy, metals, can, be, dangerous, to, welders, lacking, proper, ventilation, and, training, exposure, to, manganese, welding, fumes, for, example, even, at, low, levels, 0, 2, mg, m, 3, may, lead, to, neurological, problems, or, to, damage, to, the, lungs, liver, kidneys, or, central, nervous, system, nano, particles, can, become, trapped, in, the, alveolar, macrophages, of, the, lungs, and, induce, pulmonary, fibrosis, the, use, of, compressed, gases, and, flames, in, many, welding, processes, poses, an, explosion, and, fire, risk, some, common, precautions, include, limiting, the, amount, of, oxygen, in, the, air, and, keeping, combustible, materials, away, from, the, workplace, as, an, industrial, process, the, cost, of, welding, plays, a, crucial, role, in, manufacturing, decisions, many, different, variables, affect, the, total, cost, including, equipment, cost, labor, cost, material, cost, and, energy, cost, depending, on, the, process, equipment, cost, can, vary, from, inexpensive, for, methods, like, shielded, metal, arc, welding, and, oxyfuel, welding, to, extremely, expensive, for, methods, like, laser, beam, welding, and, electron, beam, welding, because, of, their, high, cost, they, are, only, used, in, high, production, operations, similarly, because, automation, and, robots, increase, equipment, costs, they, are, only, implemented, when, high, production, is, necessary, labor, cost, depends, on, the, deposition, rate, the, rate, of, welding, the, hourly, wage, and, the, total, operation, time, including, time, spent, fitting, welding, and, handling, the, part, the, cost, of, materials, includes, the, cost, of, the, base, and, filler, material, and, the, cost, of, shielding, gases, finally, energy, cost, depends, on, arc, time, and, welding, power, demand, for, manual, welding, methods, labor, costs, generally, make, up, the, vast, majority, of, the, total, cost, as, a, result, many, cost, saving, measures, are, focused, on, minimizing, operation, time, to, do, this, welding, procedures, with, high, deposition, rates, can, be, selected, and, weld, parameters, can, be, fine, tuned, to, increase, welding, speed, mechanization, and, automation, are, often, implemented, to, reduce, labor, costs, but, this, frequently, increases, the, cost, of, equipment, and, creates, additional, setup, time, material, costs, tend, to, increase, when, special, properties, are, necessary, and, energy, costs, normally, do, not, amount, to, more, than, several, percent, of, the, total, welding, cost, in, recent, years, in, order, to, minimize, labor, costs, in, high, production, manufacturing, industrial, welding, has, become, increasingly, more, automated, most, notably, with, the, use, of, robots, in, resistance, spot, welding, especially, in, the, automotive, industry, and, in, arc, welding, in, robot, welding, mechanized, devices, both, hold, the, material, and, perform, the, weld, and, at, first, spot, welding, was, its, most, common, application, but, robotic, arc, welding, increases, in, popularity, as, technology, advances, other, key, areas, of, research, and, development, include, the, welding, of, dissimilar, materials, such, as, steel, and, aluminum, for, example, and, new, welding, processes, such, as, friction, stir, magnetic, pulse, conductive, heat, seam, and, laser, hybrid, welding, furthermore, progress, is, desired, in, making, more, specialized, methods, like, laser, beam, welding, practical, for, more, applications, such, as, in, the, aerospace, and, automotive, industries, researchers, also, hope, to, better, understand, the, often, unpredictable, properties, of, welds, especially, microstructure, residual, stresses, and, a, weld, s, tendency, to, crack, or, deform, the, trend, of, accelerating, the, speed, at, which, welds, are, performed, in, the, steel, erection, industry, comes, at, a, risk, to, the, integrity, of, the, connection, without, proper, fusion, to, the, base, materials, provided, by, sufficient, arc, time, on, the, weld, a, project, inspector, cannot, ensure, the, effective, diameter, of, the, puddle, weld, therefore, he, or, she, cannot, guarantee, the, published, load, capacities, unless, they, witness, the, actual, installation, this, method, of, puddle, welding, is, common, in, the, united, states, and, canada, for, attaching, steel, sheets, to, bar, joist, and, structural, steel, members, regional, agencies, are, responsible, for, ensuring, the, proper, installation, of, puddle, welding, on, steel, construction, sites, currently, there, is, no, standard, or, weld, procedure, which, can, ensure, the, published, holding, capacity, of, any, unwitnessed, connection, but, this, is, under, review, by, the, american, welding, society, glasses, and, certain, types, of, plastics, are, commonly, welded, materials, unlike, metals, which, have, a, specific, melting, point, glasses, and, plastics, have, a, melting, range, called, the, glass, transition, when, heating, the, solid, material, past, the, glass, transition, temperature, t, g, into, this, range, it, will, generally, become, softer, and, more, pliable, when, it, crosses, through, the, range, above, the, glass, melting, temperature, t, m, it, will, become, a, very, thick, sluggish, viscous, liquid, slowly, decreasing, in, viscosity, as, temperature, increases, typically, this, viscous, liquid, will, have, very, little, surface, tension, compared, to, metals, becoming, a, sticky, taffy, to, honey, like, consistency, so, welding, can, usually, take, place, by, simply, pressing, two, melted, surfaces, together, the, two, liquids, will, generally, mix, and, join, at, first, contact, upon, cooling, through, the, glass, transition, the, welded, piece, will, solidify, as, one, solid, piece, of, amorphous, material, glass, welding, is, a, common, practice, during, glassblowing, it, is, used, very, often, in, the, construction, of, lighting, neon, signs, flashtubes, scientific, equipment, and, the, manufacture, of, dishes, and, other, glassware, it, is, also, used, during, glass, casting, for, joining, the, halves, of, glass, molds, making, items, such, as, bottles, and, jars, welding, glass, is, accomplished, by, heating, the, glass, through, the, glass, transition, turning, it, into, a, thick, formable, liquid, mass, heating, is, usually, done, with, a, gas, or, oxy, gas, torch, or, a, furnace, because, the, temperatures, for, melting, glass, are, often, quite, high, this, temperature, may, vary, depending, on, the, type, of, glass, for, example, lead, glass, becomes, a, weldable, liquid, at, around, 1, 600, f, 870, c, and, can, be, welded, with, a, simple, propane, torch, on, the, other, hand, quartz, glass, fused, silica, must, be, heated, to, over, 3, 000, f, 1, 650, c, but, quickly, loses, its, viscosity, and, formability, if, overheated, so, an, oxyhydrogen, torch, must, be, used, sometimes, a, tube, may, be, attached, to, the, glass, allowing, it, to, be, blown, into, various, shapes, such, as, bulbs, bottles, or, tubes, when, two, pieces, of, liquid, glass, are, pressed, together, they, will, usually, weld, very, readily, welding, a, handle, onto, a, pitcher, can, usually, be, done, with, relative, ease, however, when, welding, a, tube, to, another, tube, a, combination, of, blowing, and, suction, and, pressing, and, pulling, is, used, to, ensure, a, good, seal, to, shape, the, glass, and, to, keep, the, surface, tension, from, closing, the, tube, in, on, itself, sometimes, a, filler, rod, may, be, used, but, usually, not, because, glass, is, very, brittle, in, its, solid, state, it, is, often, prone, to, cracking, upon, heating, and, cooling, especially, if, the, heating, and, cooling, are, uneven, this, is, because, the, brittleness, of, glass, does, not, allow, for, uneven, thermal, expansion, glass, that, has, been, welded, will, usually, need, to, be, cooled, very, slowly, and, evenly, through, the, glass, transition, in, a, process, called, annealing, to, relieve, any, internal, stresses, created, by, a, temperature, gradient, there, are, many, types, of, glass, and, it, is, most, common, to, weld, using, the, same, types, different, glasses, often, have, different, rates, of, thermal, expansion, which, can, cause, them, to, crack, upon, cooling, when, they, contract, differently, for, instance, quartz, has, very, low, thermal, expansion, while, soda, lime, glass, has, very, high, thermal, expansion, when, welding, different, glasses, to, each, other, it, is, usually, important, to, closely, match, their, coefficients, of, thermal, expansion, to, ensure, that, cracking, does, not, occur, also, some, glasses, will, simply, not, mix, with, others, so, welding, between, certain, types, may, not, be, possible, glass, can, also, be, welded, to, metals, and, ceramics, although, with, metals, the, process, is, usually, more, adhesion, to, the, surface, of, the, metal, rather, than, a, commingling, of, the, two, materials, however, certain, glasses, will, typically, bond, only, to, certain, metals, for, example, lead, glass, bonds, readily, to, copper, or, molybdenum, but, not, to, aluminum, tungsten, electrodes, are, often, used, in, lighting, but, will, not, bond, to, quartz, glass, so, the, tungsten, is, often, wetted, with, molten, borosilicate, glass, which, bonds, to, both, tungsten, and, quartz, however, care, must, be, taken, to, ensure, that, all, materials, have, similar, coefficients, of, thermal, expansion, to, prevent, cracking, both, when, the, object, cools, and, when, it, is, heated, again, special, alloys, are, often, used, for, this, purpose, ensuring, that, the, coefficients, of, expansion, match, and, sometimes, thin, metallic, coatings, may, be, applied, to, a, metal, to, create, a, good, bond, with, the, glass, plastics, are, generally, divided, into, two, categories, which, are, thermosets, and, thermoplastics, a, thermoset, is, a, plastic, in, which, a, chemical, reaction, sets, the, molecular, bonds, after, first, forming, the, plastic, and, then, the, bonds, cannot, be, broken, again, without, degrading, the, plastic, thermosets, cannot, be, melted, therefore, once, a, thermoset, has, set, it, is, impossible, to, weld, it, examples, of, thermosets, include, epoxies, silicone, vulcanized, rubber, polyester, and, polyurethane, thermoplastics, by, contrast, form, long, molecular, chains, which, are, often, coiled, or, intertwined, forming, an, amorphous, structure, without, any, long, range, crystalline, order, some, thermoplastics, may, be, fully, amorphous, while, others, have, a, partially, crystalline, partially, amorphous, structure, both, amorphous, and, semicrystalline, thermoplastics, have, a, glass, transition, above, which, welding, can, occur, but, semicrystallines, also, have, a, specific, melting, point, which, is, above, the, glass, transition, above, this, melting, point, the, viscous, liquid, will, become, a, free, flowing, liquid, see, rheological, weldability, for, thermoplastics, examples, of, thermoplastics, include, polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride, pvc, and, fluoroplastics, like, teflon, and, spectralon, welding, thermoplastic, with, heat, is, very, similar, to, welding, glass, the, plastic, first, must, be, cleaned, and, then, heated, through, the, glass, transition, turning, the, weld, interface, into, a, thick, viscous, liquid, two, heated, interfaces, can, then, be, pressed, together, allowing, the, molecules, to, mix, through, intermolecular, diffusion, joining, them, as, one, then, the, plastic, is, cooled, through, the, glass, transition, allowing, the, weld, to, solidify, a, filler, rod, may, often, be, used, for, certain, types, of, joints, the, main, differences, between, welding, glass, and, plastic, are, the, types, of, heating, methods, the, much, lower, melting, temperatures, and, the, fact, that, plastics, will, burn, if, overheated, many, different, methods, have, been, devised, for, heating, plastic, to, a, weldable, temperature, without, burning, it, ovens, or, electric, heating, tools, can, be, used, to, melt, the, plastic, ultrasonic, laser, or, friction, heating, are, other, methods, resistive, metals, may, be, implanted, in, the, plastic, which, respond, to, induction, heating, some, plastics, will, begin, to, burn, at, temperatures, lower, than, their, glass, transition, so, welding, can, be, performed, by, blowing, a, heated, inert, gas, onto, the, plastic, melting, it, while, at, the, same, time, shielding, it, from, oxygen, many, thermoplastics, can, also, be, welded, using, chemical, solvents, when, placed, in, contact, with, the, plastic, the, solvent, will, begin, to, soften, it, bringing, the, surface, into, a, thick, liquid, solution, when, two, melted, surfaces, are, pressed, together, the, molecules, in, the, solution, mix, joining, them, as, one, because, the, solvent, can, permeate, the, plastic, the, solvent, evaporates, out, through, the, surface, of, the, plastic, causing, the, weld, to, drop, out, of, solution, and, solidify, a, common, use, for, solvent, welding, is, for, joining, pvc, polyvinyl, chloride, or, abs, acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene, pipes, during, plumbing, or, for, welding, styrene, and, polystyrene, plastics, in, the, construction, of, models, solvent, welding, is, especially, effective, on, plastics, like, pvc, which, burn, at, or, below, their, glass, transition, but, may, be, ineffective, on, plastics, like, teflon, or, polyethylene, that, are, resistant, to, chemical, decomposition
