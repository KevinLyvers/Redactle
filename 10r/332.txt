the, golden, gate, bridge, is, a, suspension, bridge, spanning, the, golden, gate, the, one, mile, wide, 1, 6, km, strait, connecting, san, francisco, bay, and, the, pacific, ocean, the, structure, links, the, u, s, city, of, san, francisco, california, the, northern, tip, of, the, san, francisco, peninsula, to, marin, county, carrying, both, u, s, route, 101, and, california, state, route, 1, across, the, strait, it, also, carries, pedestrian, and, bicycle, traffic, and, is, designated, as, part, of, u, s, bicycle, route, 95, recognized, by, the, american, society, of, civil, engineers, as, one, of, the, wonders, of, the, modern, world, the, bridge, is, one, of, the, most, internationally, recognized, symbols, of, san, francisco, and, california, the, idea, of, a, fixed, link, between, san, francisco, and, marin, had, gained, increasing, popularity, during, the, late, 19th, century, but, it, was, not, until, the, early, 20th, century, that, such, a, link, became, feasible, joseph, strauss, served, as, chief, engineer, for, the, project, with, leon, moisseiff, irving, morrow, and, charles, ellis, making, significant, contributions, to, its, design, the, bridge, opened, to, the, public, in, 1937, and, has, undergone, various, retrofits, and, other, improvement, projects, in, the, decades, since, the, golden, gate, bridge, is, described, in, frommer, s, travel, guide, as, possibly, the, most, beautiful, certainly, the, most, photographed, bridge, in, the, world, at, the, time, of, its, opening, in, 1937, it, was, both, the, longest, and, the, tallest, suspension, bridge, in, the, world, titles, it, held, until, 1964, and, 1998, respectively, its, main, span, is, 4, 200, feet, 1, 280, m, and, its, total, height, is, 746, feet, 227, m, before, the, bridge, was, built, the, only, practical, short, route, between, san, francisco, and, what, is, now, marin, county, was, by, boat, across, a, section, of, san, francisco, bay, a, ferry, service, began, as, early, as, 1820, with, a, regularly, scheduled, service, beginning, in, the, 1840s, for, the, purpose, of, transporting, water, to, san, francisco, in, 1867, the, sausalito, land, and, ferry, company, opened, in, 1920, the, service, was, taken, over, by, the, golden, gate, ferry, company, which, merged, in, 1929, with, the, ferry, system, of, the, southern, pacific, railroad, becoming, the, southern, pacific, golden, gate, ferries, ltd, the, largest, ferry, operation, in, the, world, once, for, railroad, passengers, and, customers, only, southern, pacific, s, automobile, ferries, became, very, profitable, and, important, to, the, regional, economy, the, ferry, crossing, between, the, hyde, street, pier, in, san, francisco, and, sausalito, ferry, terminal, in, marin, county, took, approximately, 20, minutes, and, cost, 1, 00, per, vehicle, prior, to, 1937, when, the, price, was, reduced, to, compete, with, the, new, bridge, the, trip, from, the, san, francisco, ferry, building, took, 27, minutes, many, wanted, to, build, a, bridge, to, connect, san, francisco, to, marin, county, san, francisco, was, the, largest, american, city, still, served, primarily, by, ferry, boats, because, it, did, not, have, a, permanent, link, with, communities, around, the, bay, the, city, s, growth, rate, was, below, the, national, average, many, experts, said, that, a, bridge, could, not, be, built, across, the, 6, 700, foot, 2, 000, metre, strait, which, had, strong, swirling, tides, and, currents, with, water, 372, ft, 113, m, deep, at, the, center, of, the, channel, and, frequent, strong, winds, experts, said, that, ferocious, winds, and, blinding, fogs, would, prevent, construction, and, operation, although, the, idea, of, a, bridge, spanning, the, golden, gate, was, not, new, the, proposal, that, eventually, took, hold, was, made, in, a, 1916, san, francisco, bulletin, article, by, former, engineering, student, james, wilkins, san, francisco, s, city, engineer, estimated, the, cost, at, 100, million, equivalent, to, 2, 8, billion, in, 2023, and, impractical, for, the, time, he, asked, bridge, engineers, whether, it, could, be, built, for, less, one, who, responded, joseph, strauss, was, an, ambitious, engineer, and, poet, who, had, for, his, graduate, thesis, designed, a, 55, mile, long, 89, km, railroad, bridge, across, the, bering, strait, at, the, time, strauss, had, completed, some, 400, drawbridges, most, of, which, were, inland, and, nothing, on, the, scale, of, the, new, project, strauss, s, initial, drawings, were, for, a, massive, cantilever, on, each, side, of, the, strait, connected, by, a, central, suspension, segment, which, strauss, promised, could, be, built, for, 17, million, equivalent, to, 476, million, in, 2023, a, suspension, bridge, design, was, chosen, using, recent, advances, in, bridge, design, and, metallurgy, strauss, spent, more, than, a, decade, drumming, up, support, in, northern, california, the, bridge, faced, opposition, including, litigation, from, many, sources, the, department, of, war, was, concerned, that, the, bridge, would, interfere, with, ship, traffic, the, us, navy, feared, that, a, ship, collision, or, sabotage, to, the, bridge, could, block, the, entrance, to, one, of, its, main, harbors, unions, demanded, guarantees, that, local, workers, would, be, favored, for, construction, jobs, southern, pacific, railroad, one, of, the, most, powerful, business, interests, in, california, opposed, the, bridge, as, competition, to, its, ferry, fleet, and, filed, a, lawsuit, against, the, project, leading, to, a, mass, boycott, of, the, ferry, service, in, may, 1924, colonel, herbert, deakyne, held, the, second, hearing, on, the, bridge, on, behalf, of, the, secretary, of, war, in, a, request, to, use, federal, land, for, construction, deakyne, on, behalf, of, the, secretary, of, war, approved, the, transfer, of, land, needed, for, the, bridge, structure, and, leading, roads, to, the, bridging, the, golden, gate, association, and, both, san, francisco, county, and, marin, county, pending, further, bridge, plans, by, strauss, another, ally, was, the, fledgling, automobile, industry, which, supported, the, development, of, roads, and, bridges, to, increase, demand, for, automobiles, the, bridge, s, name, was, first, used, when, the, project, was, initially, discussed, in, 1917, by, m, m, o, shaughnessy, city, engineer, of, san, francisco, and, strauss, the, name, became, official, with, the, passage, of, the, golden, gate, bridge, and, highway, district, act, by, the, state, legislature, in, 1923, creating, a, special, district, to, design, build, and, finance, the, bridge, san, francisco, and, most, of, the, counties, along, the, north, coast, of, california, joined, the, golden, gate, bridge, district, with, the, exception, being, humboldt, county, whose, residents, opposed, the, bridge, s, construction, and, the, traffic, it, would, generate, strauss, was, the, chief, engineer, in, charge, of, the, overall, design, and, construction, of, the, bridge, project, however, because, he, had, little, understanding, or, experience, with, cable, suspension, designs, responsibility, for, much, of, the, engineering, and, architecture, fell, on, other, experts, strauss, s, initial, design, proposal, two, double, cantilever, spans, linked, by, a, central, suspension, segment, was, unacceptable, from, a, visual, standpoint, the, final, suspension, design, was, conceived, and, championed, by, leon, moisseiff, the, engineer, of, the, manhattan, bridge, in, new, york, city, irving, morrow, a, relatively, unknown, residential, architect, designed, the, overall, shape, of, the, bridge, towers, the, lighting, scheme, and, art, deco, elements, such, as, the, tower, decorations, streetlights, railing, and, walkways, the, famous, international, orange, color, was, morrow, s, personal, selection, winning, out, over, other, possibilities, including, the, us, navy, s, suggestion, that, it, be, painted, with, black, and, yellow, stripes, to, ensure, visibility, by, passing, ships, senior, engineer, charles, alton, ellis, collaborating, remotely, with, moisseiff, was, the, principal, engineer, of, the, project, moisseiff, produced, the, basic, structural, design, introducing, his, deflection, theory, by, which, a, thin, flexible, roadway, would, flex, in, the, wind, greatly, reducing, stress, by, transmitting, forces, via, suspension, cables, to, the, bridge, towers, although, the, golden, gate, bridge, design, has, proved, sound, a, later, moisseiff, design, the, original, tacoma, narrows, bridge, collapsed, in, a, strong, windstorm, soon, after, it, was, completed, because, of, an, unexpected, aeroelastic, flutter, ellis, was, also, tasked, with, designing, a, bridge, within, a, bridge, in, the, southern, abutment, to, avoid, the, need, to, demolish, fort, point, a, pre, civil, war, masonry, fortification, viewed, even, then, as, worthy, of, historic, preservation, he, penned, a, graceful, steel, arch, spanning, the, fort, and, carrying, the, roadway, to, the, bridge, s, southern, anchorage, ellis, was, a, greek, scholar, and, mathematician, who, at, one, time, was, a, university, of, illinois, professor, of, engineering, despite, having, no, engineering, degree, he, eventually, earned, a, degree, in, civil, engineering, from, the, university, of, illinois, prior, to, designing, the, golden, gate, bridge, and, spent, the, last, twelve, years, of, his, career, as, a, professor, at, purdue, university, he, became, an, expert, in, structural, design, writing, the, standard, textbook, of, the, time, ellis, did, much, of, the, technical, and, theoretical, work, that, built, the, bridge, but, he, received, none, of, the, credit, in, his, lifetime, in, november, 1931, strauss, fired, ellis, and, replaced, him, with, a, former, subordinate, clifford, paine, ostensibly, for, wasting, too, much, money, sending, telegrams, back, and, forth, to, moisseiff, ellis, obsessed, with, the, project, and, unable, to, find, work, elsewhere, during, the, depression, continued, working, 70, hours, per, week, on, an, unpaid, basis, eventually, turning, in, ten, volumes, of, hand, calculations, with, an, eye, toward, self, promotion, and, posterity, strauss, downplayed, the, contributions, of, his, collaborators, who, despite, receiving, little, recognition, or, compensation, are, largely, responsible, for, the, final, form, of, the, bridge, he, succeeded, in, having, himself, credited, as, the, person, most, responsible, for, the, design, and, vision, of, the, bridge, only, much, later, were, the, contributions, of, the, others, on, the, design, team, properly, appreciated, in, may, 2007, the, golden, gate, bridge, district, issued, a, formal, report, on, 70, years, of, stewardship, of, the, famous, bridge, and, decided, to, give, ellis, major, credit, for, the, design, of, the, bridge, the, golden, gate, bridge, and, highway, district, authorized, by, an, act, of, the, california, legislature, was, incorporated, in, 1928, as, the, official, entity, to, design, construct, and, finance, the, golden, gate, bridge, however, after, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, the, district, was, unable, to, raise, the, construction, funds, so, it, lobbied, for, a, 30, million, bond, measure, equivalent, to, 532, million, today, the, bonds, were, approved, in, november, 1930, by, votes, in, the, counties, affected, by, the, bridge, the, construction, budget, at, the, time, of, approval, was, 27, million, 492, million, today, however, the, district, was, unable, to, sell, the, bonds, until, 1932, when, amadeo, giannini, the, founder, of, san, francisco, based, bank, of, america, agreed, on, behalf, of, his, bank, to, buy, the, entire, issue, in, order, to, help, the, local, economy, construction, began, on, january, 5, 1933, the, project, cost, more, than, 35, million, 610, million, in, 2023, dollars, and, was, completed, ahead, of, schedule, and, 1, 3, million, under, budget, equivalent, to, 28, 9, million, today, the, golden, gate, bridge, construction, project, was, carried, out, by, the, mcclintic, marshall, construction, co, a, subsidiary, of, bethlehem, steel, corporation, founded, by, howard, h, mcclintic, and, charles, d, marshall, both, of, lehigh, university, strauss, remained, head, of, the, project, overseeing, day, to, day, construction, and, making, some, groundbreaking, contributions, a, graduate, of, the, university, of, cincinnati, he, placed, a, brick, from, his, alma, mater, s, demolished, mcmicken, hall, in, the, south, anchorage, before, the, concrete, was, poured, strauss, also, innovated, the, use, of, movable, safety, netting, beneath, the, men, working, which, saved, many, lives, nineteen, men, saved, by, the, nets, over, the, course, of, the, project, formed, the, half, way, to, hell, club, nonetheless, eleven, men, were, killed, in, falls, ten, on, february, 17, 1937, when, a, scaffold, secured, by, undersized, bolts, with, twelve, men, on, it, fell, into, and, broke, through, the, safety, net, two, of, the, twelve, survived, the, 200, foot, 61, m, fall, into, the, water, the, bridge, opened, may, 27, 1937, the, round, house, caf, diner, was, then, included, in, the, southeastern, end, of, the, golden, gate, bridge, adjacent, to, the, tourist, plaza, which, was, renovated, in, 2012, the, round, house, caf, an, art, deco, design, by, alfred, finnila, completed, in, 1938, has, been, popular, throughout, the, years, as, a, starting, point, for, various, commercial, tours, of, the, bridge, and, an, unofficial, gift, shop, the, diner, was, renovated, in, 2012, and, the, gift, shop, was, then, removed, as, a, new, official, gift, shop, has, been, included, in, the, adjacent, plaza, during, the, bridge, work, the, assistant, civil, engineer, of, california, alfred, finnila, had, overseen, the, entire, iron, work, of, the, bridge, as, well, as, half, of, the, bridge, s, road, work, plaque, of, the, major, contributors, to, the, golden, gate, bridge, lists, contractors, engineering, staff, directors, and, officers, contractors, engineering, staff, directors, officers, on, december, 1, 1951, a, windstorm, revealed, swaying, and, rolling, instabilities, of, the, bridge, resulting, in, its, closure, in, 1953, and, 1954, the, bridge, was, retrofitted, with, lateral, and, diagonal, bracing, that, connected, the, lower, chords, of, the, two, side, trusses, this, bracing, stiffened, the, bridge, deck, in, torsion, so, that, it, would, better, resist, the, types, of, twisting, that, had, destroyed, the, tacoma, narrows, bridge, in, 1940, the, original, bridge, used, a, concrete, deck, salt, carried, by, fog, or, mist, reached, the, rebar, causing, corrosion, and, concrete, spalling, from, 1982, to, 1986, the, original, bridge, deck, in, 747, sections, was, systematically, replaced, with, a, 40, lighter, and, stronger, steel, orthotropic, deck, panels, over, 401, nights, without, closing, the, roadway, completely, to, traffic, the, roadway, was, also, widened, by, two, feet, resulting, in, outside, curb, lane, width, of, 11, feet, instead, of, 10, feet, for, the, inside, lanes, this, deck, replacement, was, the, bridge, s, greatest, engineering, project, since, it, was, built, and, cost, over, 68, million, the, bridge, opening, celebration, in, 1937, began, on, may, 27, and, lasted, for, one, week, the, day, before, vehicle, traffic, was, allowed, 200, 000, people, crossed, either, on, foot, or, on, roller, skates, on, opening, day, mayor, angelo, rossi, and, other, officials, rode, the, ferry, to, marin, then, crossed, the, bridge, in, a, motorcade, past, three, ceremonial, barriers, the, last, a, blockade, of, beauty, queens, who, required, joseph, strauss, to, present, the, bridge, to, the, highway, district, before, allowing, him, to, pass, an, official, song, there, s, a, silver, moon, on, the, golden, gate, was, chosen, to, commemorate, the, event, strauss, wrote, a, poem, that, is, now, on, the, golden, gate, bridge, entitled, the, mighty, task, is, done, the, next, day, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, pushed, a, button, in, washington, d, c, signaling, the, official, start, of, vehicle, traffic, over, the, bridge, at, noon, weeks, of, civil, and, cultural, activities, called, the, fiesta, followed, a, statue, of, strauss, was, moved, in, 1955, to, a, site, near, the, bridge, as, part, of, the, fiftieth, anniversary, celebration, in, 1987, the, golden, gate, bridge, district, again, closed, the, bridge, to, automobile, traffic, and, allowed, pedestrians, to, cross, it, on, may, 24, this, sunday, morning, celebration, attracted, 750, 000, to, 1, 000, 000, people, and, ineffective, crowd, control, meant, the, bridge, became, congested, with, roughly, 300, 000, people, causing, the, center, span, of, the, bridge, to, flatten, out, under, the, weight, although, the, bridge, is, designed, to, flex, in, that, way, under, heavy, loads, and, was, estimated, not, to, have, exceeded, 40, of, the, yielding, stress, of, the, suspension, cables, bridge, officials, stated, that, uncontrolled, pedestrian, access, was, not, being, considered, as, part, of, the, 75th, anniversary, on, sunday, may, 27, 2012, because, of, the, additional, law, enforcement, costs, required, since, 9, 11, until, 1964, the, golden, gate, bridge, had, the, longest, suspension, bridge, main, span, in, the, world, at, 4, 200, feet, 1, 280, m, since, 1964, its, main, span, length, has, been, surpassed, by, eighteen, bridges, it, now, has, the, second, longest, main, span, in, the, americas, after, the, verrazzano, narrows, bridge, in, new, york, city, the, total, length, of, the, golden, gate, bridge, from, abutment, to, abutment, is, 8, 981, feet, 2, 737, m, the, golden, gate, bridge, s, clearance, above, high, water, averages, 220, feet, 67, m, while, its, towers, at, 746, feet, 227, m, above, the, water, were, the, world, s, tallest, on, a, suspension, bridge, until, 1993, when, it, was, surpassed, by, the, mezcala, bridge, in, mexico, the, weight, of, the, roadway, is, hung, from, 250, pairs, of, vertical, suspender, ropes, which, are, attached, to, two, main, cables, the, main, cables, pass, over, the, two, main, towers, and, are, fixed, in, concrete, at, each, end, each, cable, is, made, of, 27, 572, strands, of, wire, the, total, length, of, galvanized, steel, wire, used, to, fabricate, both, main, cables, is, estimated, to, be, 80, 000, miles, 130, 000, km, each, of, the, bridge, s, two, towers, has, approximately, 600, 000, rivets, in, the, 1960s, when, the, bay, area, rapid, transit, system, bart, was, being, planned, the, engineering, community, had, conflicting, opinions, about, the, feasibility, of, running, train, tracks, north, to, marin, county, over, the, bridge, in, june, 1961, consultants, hired, by, bart, completed, a, study, that, determined, the, bridge, s, suspension, section, was, capable, of, supporting, service, on, a, new, lower, deck, in, july, 1961, one, of, the, bridge, s, consulting, engineers, clifford, paine, disagreed, with, their, conclusion, in, january, 1962, due, to, more, conflicting, reports, on, feasibility, the, bridge, s, board, of, directors, appointed, an, engineering, review, board, to, analyze, all, the, reports, the, review, board, s, report, released, in, april, 1962, concluded, that, running, bart, on, the, bridge, was, not, advisable, aesthetics, was, the, foremost, reason, why, the, first, design, of, joseph, strauss, was, rejected, upon, re, submission, of, his, bridge, construction, plan, he, added, details, such, as, lighting, to, outline, the, bridge, s, cables, and, towers, in, 1999, it, was, ranked, fifth, on, the, list, of, america, s, favorite, architecture, by, the, american, institute, of, architects, the, color, of, the, bridge, is, officially, an, orange, vermilion, called, international, orange, the, color, was, selected, by, consulting, architect, irving, morrow, because, it, complements, the, natural, surroundings, and, enhances, the, bridge, s, visibility, in, fog, the, bridge, was, originally, painted, with, red, lead, primer, and, a, lead, based, topcoat, which, was, touched, up, as, required, in, the, mid, 1960s, a, program, was, started, to, improve, corrosion, protection, by, stripping, the, original, paint, and, repainting, the, bridge, with, zinc, silicate, primer, and, vinyl, topcoats, since, 1990, acrylic, topcoats, have, been, used, instead, for, air, quality, reasons, the, program, was, completed, in, 1995, and, it, is, now, maintained, by, 38, painters, who, touch, up, the, paintwork, where, it, becomes, seriously, corroded, the, ongoing, maintenance, task, of, painting, the, bridge, is, continuous, most, maps, and, signage, mark, the, bridge, as, part, of, the, concurrency, between, u, s, route, 101, and, california, state, route, 1, although, part, of, the, national, highway, system, the, bridge, is, not, officially, part, of, california, s, highway, system, for, example, under, the, california, streets, and, highways, code, 401, route, 101, ends, at, the, approach, to, the, golden, gate, bridge, and, then, resumes, at, a, point, in, marin, county, opposite, san, francisco, the, golden, gate, bridge, highway, and, transportation, district, has, jurisdiction, over, the, segment, of, highway, that, crosses, the, bridge, instead, of, the, california, department, of, transportation, caltrans, the, movable, median, barrier, between, the, lanes, is, moved, several, times, daily, to, conform, to, traffic, patterns, on, weekday, mornings, traffic, flows, mostly, southbound, into, the, city, so, four, of, the, six, lanes, run, southbound, conversely, on, weekday, afternoons, four, lanes, run, northbound, during, off, peak, periods, and, weekends, traffic, is, split, with, three, lanes, in, each, direction, from, 1968, to, 2015, opposing, traffic, was, separated, by, small, plastic, pylons, during, that, time, there, were, 16, fatalities, resulting, from, 128, head, on, collisions, to, improve, safety, the, speed, limit, on, the, golden, gate, bridge, was, reduced, from, 50, to, 45, mph, 80, to, 72, km, h, on, october, 1, 1983, although, there, had, been, discussion, concerning, the, installation, of, a, movable, barrier, since, the, 1980s, only, in, march, 2005, did, the, bridge, board, of, directors, commit, to, finding, funding, to, complete, the, 2, million, study, required, prior, to, the, installation, of, a, movable, median, barrier, installation, of, the, resulting, barrier, was, completed, on, january, 11, 2015, following, a, closure, of, 45, 5, hours, to, private, vehicle, traffic, the, longest, in, the, bridge, s, history, the, new, barrier, system, including, the, zipper, trucks, cost, approximately, 30, 3, million, to, purchase, and, install, the, bridge, carries, about, 112, 000, vehicles, per, day, according, to, the, golden, gate, bridge, highway, and, transportation, district, the, bridge, is, popular, with, pedestrians, and, bicyclists, and, was, built, with, walkways, on, either, side, of, the, six, vehicle, traffic, lanes, initially, they, were, separated, from, the, traffic, lanes, by, only, a, metal, curb, but, railings, between, the, walkways, and, the, traffic, lanes, were, added, in, 2003, primarily, as, a, measure, to, prevent, bicyclists, from, falling, into, the, roadway, the, bridge, was, designated, as, part, of, u, s, bicycle, route, 95, in, 2021, the, main, walkway, is, on, the, eastern, side, and, is, open, for, use, by, both, pedestrians, and, bicycles, in, the, morning, to, mid, afternoon, during, weekdays, 5, 00, a, m, to, 3, 30, p, m, and, to, pedestrians, only, for, the, remaining, daylight, hours, until, 6, 00, p, m, or, 9, 00, p, m, during, dst, the, eastern, walkway, is, reserved, for, pedestrians, on, weekends, 5, 00, a, m, to, 6, 00, p, m, or, 9, 00, p, m, during, dst, and, is, open, exclusively, to, bicyclists, in, the, evening, and, overnight, when, it, is, closed, to, pedestrians, the, western, walkway, is, open, only, for, bicyclists, and, only, during, the, hours, when, they, are, not, allowed, on, the, eastern, walkway, bus, service, across, the, bridge, is, provided, by, one, public, transportation, agency, golden, gate, transit, which, runs, numerous, bus, lines, throughout, the,
