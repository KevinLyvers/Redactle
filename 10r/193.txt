geothermal, power, is, electrical, power, generated, from, geothermal, energy, technologies, in, use, include, dry, steam, power, stations, flash, steam, power, stations, and, binary, cycle, power, stations, geothermal, electricity, generation, is, currently, used, in, 26, countries, while, geothermal, heating, is, in, use, in, 70, countries, as, of, 2019, worldwide, geothermal, power, capacity, amounts, to, 15, 4, gigawatts, gw, of, which, 23, 9, 3, 68, gw, are, installed, in, the, united, states, international, markets, grew, at, an, average, annual, rate, of, 5, percent, over, the, three, years, to, 2015, and, global, geothermal, power, capacity, is, expected, to, reach, 14, 5, 17, 6, gw, by, 2020, based, on, current, geologic, knowledge, and, technology, the, geothermal, energy, association, gea, publicly, discloses, the, gea, estimates, that, only, 6, 9, of, total, global, potential, has, been, tapped, so, far, while, the, ipcc, reported, geothermal, power, potential, to, be, in, the, range, of, 35, gw, to, 2, tw, countries, generating, more, than, 15, percent, of, their, electricity, from, geothermal, sources, include, el, salvador, kenya, the, philippines, iceland, new, zealand, and, costa, rica, indonesia, has, an, estimated, potential, of, 29, gw, of, geothermal, energy, resources, the, largest, in, the, world, in, 2017, its, installed, capacity, was, 1, 8, gw, geothermal, power, is, considered, to, be, a, sustainable, renewable, source, of, energy, because, the, heat, extraction, is, small, compared, with, the, earth, s, heat, content, the, greenhouse, gas, emissions, of, geothermal, electric, stations, average, 45, grams, of, carbon, dioxide, per, kilowatt, hour, of, electricity, or, less, than, 5, of, those, of, conventional, coal, fired, plants, as, a, source, of, renewable, energy, for, both, power, and, heating, geothermal, has, the, potential, to, meet, 3, to, 5, of, global, demand, by, 2050, with, economic, incentives, it, is, estimated, that, by, 2100, it, will, be, possible, to, meet, 10, of, global, demand, with, geothermal, power, in, the, 20th, century, demand, for, electricity, led, to, the, consideration, of, geothermal, power, as, a, generating, source, prince, piero, ginori, conti, tested, the, first, geothermal, power, generator, on, 4, july, 1904, in, larderello, italy, it, successfully, lit, four, light, bulbs, later, in, 1911, the, world, s, first, commercial, geothermal, power, station, was, built, there, experimental, generators, were, built, in, beppu, japan, and, the, geysers, california, in, the, 1920s, but, italy, was, the, world, s, only, industrial, producer, of, geothermal, electricity, until, 1958, in, 1958, new, zealand, became, the, second, major, industrial, producer, of, geothermal, electricity, when, its, wairakei, station, was, commissioned, wairakei, was, the, first, station, to, use, flash, steam, technology, over, the, past, 60, years, net, fluid, production, has, been, in, excess, of, 2, 5km, 3, subsidence, at, wairakei, tauhara, has, been, an, issue, in, a, number, of, formal, hearings, related, to, environmental, consents, for, expanded, development, of, the, system, as, a, source, of, renewable, energy, in, 1960, pacific, gas, and, electric, began, operation, of, the, first, successful, geothermal, electric, power, station, in, the, united, states, at, the, geysers, in, california, the, original, turbine, lasted, for, more, than, 30, years, and, produced, 11, mw, net, power, the, binary, cycle, power, station, was, first, demonstrated, in, 1967, in, the, soviet, union, and, later, introduced, to, the, united, states, in, 1981, following, the, 1970s, energy, crisis, and, significant, changes, in, regulatory, policies, this, technology, allows, the, use, of, much, lower, temperature, resources, than, were, previously, recoverable, in, 2006, a, binary, cycle, station, in, chena, hot, springs, alaska, came, on, line, producing, electricity, from, a, record, low, fluid, temperature, of, 57, c, 135, f, geothermal, electric, stations, have, until, recently, been, built, exclusively, where, high, temperature, geothermal, resources, are, available, near, the, surface, the, development, of, binary, cycle, power, plants, and, improvements, in, drilling, and, extraction, technology, may, enable, enhanced, geothermal, systems, over, a, much, greater, geographical, range, demonstration, projects, are, operational, in, landau, pfalz, germany, and, soultz, sous, for, ts, france, while, an, earlier, effort, in, basel, switzerland, was, shut, down, after, it, triggered, earthquakes, other, demonstration, projects, are, under, construction, in, australia, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, of, america, the, thermal, efficiency, of, geothermal, electric, stations, is, low, around, 7, 10, because, geothermal, fluids, are, at, a, low, temperature, compared, with, steam, from, boilers, by, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, this, low, temperature, limits, the, efficiency, of, heat, engines, in, extracting, useful, energy, during, the, generation, of, electricity, exhaust, heat, is, wasted, unless, it, can, be, used, directly, and, locally, for, example, in, greenhouses, timber, mills, and, district, heating, the, efficiency, of, the, system, does, not, affect, operational, costs, as, it, would, for, a, coal, or, other, fossil, fuel, plant, but, it, does, factor, into, the, viability, of, the, station, in, order, to, produce, more, energy, than, the, pumps, consume, electricity, generation, requires, high, temperature, geothermal, fields, and, specialized, heat, cycles, because, geothermal, power, does, not, rely, on, variable, sources, of, energy, unlike, for, example, wind, or, solar, its, capacity, factor, can, be, quite, large, up, to, 96, has, been, demonstrated, however, the, global, average, capacity, factor, was, 74, 5, in, 2008, according, to, the, ipcc, the, earth, s, heat, content, is, about, 1, 10, 19, tj, 2, 8, 10, 15, twh, this, heat, naturally, flows, to, the, surface, by, conduction, at, a, rate, of, 44, 2, tw, and, is, replenished, by, radioactive, decay, at, a, rate, of, 30, tw, these, power, rates, are, more, than, double, humanity, s, current, energy, consumption, from, primary, sources, but, most, of, this, power, is, too, diffuse, approximately, 0, 1, w, m, 2, on, average, to, be, recoverable, the, earth, s, crust, effectively, acts, as, a, thick, insulating, blanket, which, must, be, pierced, by, fluid, conduits, of, magma, water, or, other, to, release, the, heat, underneath, electricity, generation, requires, high, temperature, resources, that, can, only, come, from, deep, underground, the, heat, must, be, carried, to, the, surface, by, fluid, circulation, either, through, magma, conduits, hot, springs, hydrothermal, circulation, oil, wells, drilled, water, wells, or, a, combination, of, these, this, circulation, sometimes, exists, naturally, where, the, crust, is, thin, magma, conduits, bring, heat, close, to, the, surface, and, hot, springs, bring, the, heat, to, the, surface, if, a, hot, spring, is, not, available, a, well, must, be, drilled, into, a, hot, aquifer, away, from, tectonic, plate, boundaries, the, geothermal, gradient, is, 25, 30, c, per, kilometre, km, of, depth, in, most, of, the, world, so, wells, would, have, to, be, several, kilometres, deep, to, permit, electricity, generation, the, quantity, and, quality, of, recoverable, resources, improves, with, drilling, depth, and, proximity, to, tectonic, plate, boundaries, in, ground, that, is, hot, but, dry, or, where, water, pressure, is, inadequate, injected, fluid, can, stimulate, production, developers, bore, two, holes, into, a, candidate, site, and, fracture, the, rock, between, them, with, explosives, or, high, pressure, water, then, they, pump, water, or, liquefied, carbon, dioxide, down, one, borehole, and, it, comes, up, the, other, borehole, as, a, gas, this, approach, is, called, hot, dry, rock, geothermal, energy, in, europe, or, enhanced, geothermal, systems, in, north, america, much, greater, potential, may, be, available, from, this, approach, than, from, conventional, tapping, of, natural, aquifers, estimates, of, the, electricity, generating, potential, of, geothermal, energy, vary, from, 35, to, 2000, gw, depending, on, the, scale, of, investments, this, does, not, include, non, electric, heat, recovered, by, co, generation, geothermal, heat, pumps, and, other, direct, use, a, 2006, report, by, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, that, included, the, potential, of, enhanced, geothermal, systems, estimated, that, investing, us, 1, billion, in, research, and, development, over, 15, years, would, allow, the, creation, of, 100, gw, of, electrical, generating, capacity, by, 2050, in, the, united, states, alone, the, mit, report, estimated, that, over, 200, 10, 9, tj, 200, zj, 5, 6, 10, 7, twh, would, be, extractable, with, the, potential, to, increase, this, to, over, 2, 000, zj, with, technology, improvements, sufficient, to, provide, all, the, world, s, present, energy, needs, for, several, millennia, at, present, geothermal, wells, are, rarely, more, than, 3, km, 1, 9, mi, deep, upper, estimates, of, geothermal, resources, assume, wells, as, deep, as, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, drilling, near, this, depth, is, now, possible, in, the, petroleum, industry, although, it, is, an, expensive, process, the, deepest, research, well, in, the, world, the, kola, superdeep, borehole, ksdb, 3, is, 12, 261, km, 7, 619, mi, deep, wells, drilled, to, depths, greater, than, 4, km, 2, 5, mi, generally, incur, drilling, costs, in, the, tens, of, millions, of, dollars, the, technological, challenges, are, to, drill, wide, bores, at, low, cost, and, to, break, larger, volumes, of, rock, geothermal, power, is, considered, to, be, sustainable, because, the, heat, extraction, is, small, compared, to, the, earth, s, heat, content, but, extraction, must, still, be, monitored, to, avoid, local, depletion, although, geothermal, sites, are, capable, of, providing, heat, for, many, decades, individual, wells, may, cool, down, or, run, out, of, water, the, three, oldest, sites, at, larderello, wairakei, and, the, geysers, have, all, reduced, production, from, their, peaks, it, is, not, clear, whether, these, stations, extracted, energy, faster, than, it, was, replenished, from, greater, depths, or, whether, the, aquifers, supplying, them, are, being, depleted, if, production, is, reduced, and, water, is, reinjected, these, wells, could, theoretically, recover, their, full, potential, such, mitigation, strategies, have, already, been, implemented, at, some, sites, the, long, term, sustainability, of, geothermal, energy, has, been, demonstrated, at, the, larderello, field, in, italy, since, 1913, at, the, wairakei, field, in, new, zealand, since, 1958, and, at, the, geysers, field, in, california, since, 1960, geothermal, power, stations, are, similar, to, other, steam, turbine, thermal, power, stations, in, that, heat, from, a, fuel, source, in, geothermal, s, case, the, earth, s, core, is, used, to, heat, water, or, another, working, fluid, the, working, fluid, is, then, used, to, turn, a, turbine, of, a, generator, thereby, producing, electricity, the, fluid, is, then, cooled, and, returned, to, the, heat, source, dry, steam, stations, are, the, simplest, and, oldest, design, there, are, few, power, stations, of, this, type, because, they, require, a, resource, that, produces, dry, steam, but, they, are, the, most, efficient, with, the, simplest, facilities, at, these, sites, there, may, be, liquid, water, present, in, the, reservoir, but, only, steam, not, water, is, produced, to, the, surface, dry, steam, power, directly, uses, geothermal, steam, of, 150, c, or, greater, to, turn, turbines, as, the, turbine, rotates, it, powers, a, generator, that, produces, electricity, and, adds, to, the, power, field, then, the, steam, is, emitted, to, a, condenser, where, it, turns, back, into, a, liquid, which, then, cools, the, water, after, the, water, is, cooled, it, flows, down, a, pipe, that, conducts, the, condensate, back, into, deep, wells, where, it, can, be, reheated, and, produced, again, at, the, geysers, in, california, after, the, first, 30, years, of, power, production, the, steam, supply, had, depleted, and, generation, was, substantially, reduced, to, restore, some, of, the, former, capacity, supplemental, water, injection, was, developed, during, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, including, utilization, of, effluent, from, nearby, municipal, sewage, treatment, facilities, flash, steam, stations, pull, deep, high, pressure, hot, water, into, lower, pressure, tanks, and, use, the, resulting, flashed, steam, to, drive, turbines, they, require, fluid, temperatures, of, at, least, 180, c, usually, more, this, is, the, most, common, type, of, station, in, operation, today, flash, steam, plants, use, geothermal, reservoirs, of, water, with, temperatures, greater, than, 360, f, 182, c, the, hot, water, flows, up, through, wells, in, the, ground, under, its, own, pressure, as, it, flows, upward, the, pressure, decreases, and, some, of, the, hot, water, is, transformed, into, steam, the, steam, is, then, separated, from, the, water, and, used, to, power, a, turbine, generator, any, leftover, water, and, condensed, steam, may, be, injected, back, into, the, reservoir, making, this, a, potentially, sustainable, resource, binary, cycle, power, stations, are, the, most, recent, development, and, can, accept, fluid, temperatures, as, low, as, 57, c, the, moderately, hot, geothermal, water, is, passed, by, a, secondary, fluid, with, a, much, lower, boiling, point, than, water, this, causes, the, secondary, fluid, to, flash, vaporize, which, then, drives, the, turbines, this, is, the, most, common, type, of, geothermal, electricity, station, being, constructed, today, both, organic, rankine, and, kalina, cycles, are, used, the, thermal, efficiency, of, this, type, of, station, is, typically, about, 10, 13, binary, cycle, power, plants, have, an, average, unit, capacity, of, 6, 3, mw, 30, 4, mw, at, single, flash, power, plants, 37, 4, mw, at, double, flash, plants, and, 45, 4, mw, at, power, plants, working, on, superheated, steam, the, international, renewable, energy, agency, has, reported, that, 14, 438, megawatts, mw, of, geothermal, power, was, online, worldwide, at, the, end, of, 2020, generating, 94, 949, gwh, of, electricity, in, theory, the, world, s, geothermal, resources, are, sufficient, to, supply, humans, with, energy, however, only, a, tiny, fraction, of, the, world, s, geothermal, resources, can, at, present, be, explored, on, a, profitable, basis, al, gore, said, in, the, climate, project, asia, pacific, summit, that, indonesia, could, become, a, super, power, country, in, electricity, production, from, geothermal, energy, in, 2013, the, publicly, owned, electricity, sector, in, india, announced, a, plan, to, develop, the, country, s, first, geothermal, power, facility, in, the, landlocked, state, of, chhattisgarh, geothermal, power, in, canada, has, high, potential, due, to, its, position, on, the, pacific, ring, of, fire, the, region, of, greatest, potential, is, the, canadian, cordillera, stretching, from, british, columbia, to, the, yukon, where, estimates, of, generating, output, have, ranged, from, 1, 550, mw, to, 5, 000, mw, the, geography, of, japan, is, uniquely, suited, for, geothermal, power, production, japan, has, numerous, hot, springs, that, could, provide, fuel, for, geothermal, power, plants, but, a, massive, investment, in, japan, s, infrastructure, would, be, necessary, the, largest, group, of, geothermal, power, plants, in, the, world, is, located, at, the, geysers, a, geothermal, field, in, california, united, states, as, of, 2021, five, countries, kenya, iceland, el, salvador, new, zealand, and, nicaragua, generate, more, than, 15, of, their, electricity, from, geothermal, sources, the, following, table, lists, these, data, for, each, country, data, are, for, the, year, 2021, data, are, sourced, from, the, eia, only, includes, countries, with, more, than, 0, 01, twh, of, generation, links, for, each, location, go, to, the, relevant, geothermal, power, page, when, available, existing, geothermal, electric, stations, that, fall, within, the, 50th, percentile, of, all, total, life, cycle, emissions, studies, reviewed, by, the, ipcc, produce, on, average, 45, kg, of, co, 2, equivalent, emissions, per, megawatt, hour, of, generated, electricity, kg, co, 2, eq, mw, h, for, comparison, a, coal, fired, power, plant, emits, 1, 001, kg, of, co, 2, equivalent, per, megawatt, hour, when, not, coupled, with, carbon, capture, and, storage, ccs, as, many, geothermal, projects, are, situated, in, volcanically, active, areas, that, naturally, emit, greenhouse, gases, it, is, hypothesized, that, geothermal, plants, may, actually, decrease, the, rate, of, de, gassing, by, reducing, the, pressure, on, underground, reservoirs, stations, that, experience, high, levels, of, acids, and, volatile, chemicals, are, usually, equipped, with, emission, control, systems, to, reduce, the, exhaust, geothermal, stations, can, also, inject, these, gases, back, into, the, earth, as, a, form, of, carbon, capture, and, storage, such, as, in, new, zealand, and, in, the, carbfix, project, in, iceland, other, stations, like, the, k, z, ldere, geothermal, power, plant, exhibit, the, capability, to, utilize, geothermal, fluids, to, process, carbon, dioxide, gas, into, dry, ice, at, two, nearby, plants, resulting, in, very, little, environmental, impact, in, addition, to, dissolved, gases, hot, water, from, geothermal, sources, may, hold, in, solution, trace, amounts, of, toxic, chemicals, such, as, mercury, arsenic, boron, antimony, and, salt, these, chemicals, come, out, of, solution, as, the, water, cools, and, can, cause, environmental, damage, if, released, the, modern, practice, of, injecting, geothermal, fluids, back, into, the, earth, to, stimulate, production, has, the, side, benefit, of, reducing, this, environmental, risk, station, construction, can, adversely, affect, land, stability, subsidence, has, occurred, in, the, wairakei, field, in, new, zealand, enhanced, geothermal, systems, can, trigger, earthquakes, due, to, water, injection, the, project, in, basel, switzerland, was, suspended, because, more, than, 10, 000, seismic, events, measuring, up, to, 3, 4, on, the, richter, scale, occurred, over, the, first, 6, days, of, water, injection, the, risk, of, geothermal, drilling, leading, to, uplift, has, been, experienced, in, staufen, im, breisgau, geothermal, has, minimal, land, and, freshwater, requirements, geothermal, stations, use, 404, square, meters, per, gw, h, versus, 3, 632, and, 1, 335, square, meters, for, coal, facilities, and, wind, farms, respectively, they, use, 20, litres, of, freshwater, per, mw, h, versus, over, 1000, litres, per, mw, h, for, nuclear, coal, or, oil, local, climate, cooling, is, possible, as, a, result, of, the, work, of, the, geothermal, circulation, systems, however, according, to, an, estimation, given, by, leningrad, mining, institute, in, 1980s, possible, cool, down, will, be, negligible, compared, to, natural, climate, fluctuations, while, volcanic, activity, produces, geothermal, energy, it, is, also, risky, as, of, 2022, the, puna, geothermal, venture, has, still, not, returned, to, full, capacity, after, the, 2018, lower, puna, eruption, geothermal, power, requires, no, fuel, it, is, therefore, immune, to, fuel, cost, fluctuations, however, capital, costs, tend, to, be, high, drilling, accounts, for, over, half, the, costs, and, exploration, of, deep, resources, entails, significant, risks, a, typical, well, doublet, in, nevada, can, support, 4, 5, megawatts, mw, of, electricity, generation, and, costs, about, 10, million, to, drill, with, a, 20, failure, rate, in, total, electrical, station, construction, and, well, drilling, costs, about, 2, 5, million, per, mw, of, electrical, capacity, while, the, levelised, energy, cost, is, 0, 04, 0, 10, per, kw, h, enhanced, geothermal, systems, tend, to, be, on, the, high, side, of, these, ranges, with, capital, costs, above, 4, million, per, mw, and, levelized, costs, above, 0, 054, per, kw, h, in, 2007, research, suggests, in, reservoir, storage, could, increase, the, economic, viability, of, enhanced, geothermal, systems, in, energy, systems, with, a, large, share, of, variable, renewable, energy, sources, geothermal, power, is, highly, scalable, a, small, power, station, can, supply, a, rural, village, though, initial, capital, costs, can, be, high, the, most, developed, geothermal, field, is, the, geysers, in, california, in, 2008, this, field, supported, 15, stations, all, owned, by, calpine, with, a, total, generating, capacity, of, 725, mw
