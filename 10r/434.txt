in, pottery, a, potter, s, wheel, is, a, machine, used, in, the, shaping, known, as, throwing, of, clay, into, round, ceramic, ware, the, wheel, may, also, be, used, during, the, process, of, trimming, excess, clay, from, leather, hard, dried, ware, that, is, stiff, but, malleable, and, for, applying, incised, decoration, or, rings, of, colour, use, of, the, potter, s, wheel, became, widespread, throughout, the, old, world, but, was, unknown, in, the, pre, columbian, new, world, where, pottery, was, handmade, by, methods, that, included, coiling, and, beating, a, potter, s, wheel, may, occasionally, be, referred, to, as, a, potter, s, lathe, however, that, term, is, better, used, for, another, kind, of, machine, that, is, used, for, a, different, shaping, process, turning, similar, to, that, used, for, shaping, of, metal, and, wooden, articles, the, pottery, wheel, is, an, important, component, to, create, arts, and, craft, products, the, techniques, of, jiggering, and, jolleying, can, be, seen, as, extensions, of, the, potter, s, wheel, in, jiggering, a, shaped, tool, is, slowly, brought, down, onto, the, plastic, clay, body, that, has, been, placed, on, top, of, the, rotating, plaster, mould, the, jigger, tool, shapes, one, face, the, mould, the, other, the, term, is, specific, to, the, shaping, of, flat, ware, such, as, plates, whilst, a, similar, technique, jolleying, refers, to, the, production, of, hollow, ware, such, as, cups, prior, to, using, a, wheel, all, of, these, civilizations, used, techniques, such, as, pinching, coiling, paddling, and, shaping, to, create, ceramic, forms, in, addition, several, of, these, crafts, can, continue, to, be, used, while, on, the, wheel, to, create, more, rounded, or, symmetrical, shapes, most, early, ceramic, ware, was, hand, built, using, a, simple, coiling, technique, in, which, clay, was, rolled, into, long, threads, that, were, then, pinched, and, smoothed, together, to, form, the, body, of, a, vessel, in, the, coiling, method, of, construction, all, the, energy, required, to, form, the, main, part, of, a, piece, is, supplied, indirectly, by, the, hands, of, the, potter, early, ceramics, built, by, coiling, were, often, placed, on, mats, or, large, leaves, to, allow, them, to, be, worked, more, conveniently, the, evidence, of, this, lies, in, mat, or, leaf, impressions, left, in, the, clay, of, the, base, of, the, pot, this, arrangement, allowed, the, potter, to, rotate, the, vessel, during, construction, rather, than, walk, around, it, to, add, coils, of, clay, the, oldest, forms, of, the, potter, s, wheel, called, tourneys, or, slow, wheels, were, probably, developed, as, an, extension, to, this, procedure, tournettes, in, use, around, 3500, bc, in, the, near, east, were, turned, slowly, by, hand, or, by, foot, while, coiling, a, pot, only, a, small, range, of, vessels, were, fashioned, on, the, tournette, suggesting, that, it, was, used, by, a, limited, number, of, potters, the, introduction, of, the, slow, wheel, increased, the, efficiency, of, hand, powered, pottery, production, in, the, mid, to, late, 3rd, millennium, bc, the, fast, wheel, was, developed, which, operated, on, the, flywheel, principle, it, utilised, energy, stored, in, the, rotating, mass, of, the, heavy, stone, wheel, itself, to, speed, the, process, this, wheel, was, wound, up, and, charged, with, energy, by, kicking, or, pushing, it, around, with, a, stick, providing, angular, momentum, the, fast, wheel, enabled, a, new, process, of, pottery, making, to, develop, called, throwing, in, which, a, lump, of, clay, was, placed, centrally, on, the, wheel, and, then, squeezed, lifted, and, shaped, as, the, wheel, turned, the, process, tends, to, leave, rings, on, the, inside, of, the, pot, and, can, be, used, to, create, thinner, walled, pieces, and, a, wider, variety, of, shapes, including, stemmed, vessels, so, wheel, thrown, pottery, can, be, distinguished, from, handmade, potters, could, now, produce, many, more, pots, per, hour, a, first, step, towards, industrialization, many, modern, scholars, suggest, that, the, first, potter, s, wheel, was, first, developed, by, the, ancient, sumerians, in, mesopotamia, a, stone, potter, s, wheel, found, at, the, sumerian, city, of, ur, in, modern, day, iraq, has, been, dated, to, about, 3129, bc, but, fragments, of, wheel, thrown, pottery, of, an, even, earlier, date, have, been, recovered, in, the, same, area, however, southeastern, europe, and, china, have, also, been, claimed, as, possible, places, of, origin, a, potter, s, wheel, in, western, ukraine, from, the, cucuteni, trypillia, culture, has, been, dated, to, the, middle, of, the, 5th, millennium, bc, and, is, the, oldest, ever, found, and, which, further, precedes, the, earliest, use, of, the, potter, s, wheel, in, mesopotamia, by, several, hundred, years, on, the, other, hand, egypt, is, considered, as, being, the, place, of, origin, of, the, potter, s, wheel, it, was, here, that, the, turntable, shaft, was, lengthened, about, 3000, bc, and, a, flywheel, added, the, flywheel, was, kicked, and, later, was, moved, by, pulling, the, edge, with, the, left, hand, while, forming, the, clay, with, the, right, this, led, to, the, counterclockwise, motion, for, the, potter, s, wheel, which, is, almost, universal, thus, the, exact, origin, of, the, wheel, is, not, wholly, clear, yet, in, the, iron, age, the, potter, s, wheel, in, common, use, had, a, turning, platform, about, one, metre, 3, feet, over, the, floor, connected, by, a, long, axle, to, a, heavy, flywheel, at, ground, level, this, arrangement, allowed, the, potter, to, keep, the, turning, wheel, rotating, by, kicking, the, flywheel, with, the, foot, leaving, both, hands, free, for, manipulating, the, vessel, under, construction, however, from, an, ergonomic, standpoint, sweeping, the, foot, from, side, to, side, against, the, spinning, hub, is, rather, awkward, at, some, point, an, alternative, solution, was, invented, that, involved, a, crankshaft, with, a, lever, that, converted, up, and, down, motion, into, rotary, motion, in, japan, the, potter, s, wheel, first, showed, by, in, the, asuka, or, sueki, period, 552, 710, ce, where, wares, were, more, sophisticated, and, complicated, in, addition, to, the, new, technology, of, the, wheel, firing, was, also, changed, to, a, much, higher, temperature, in, a, rudimentary, kiln, the, industrialization, continued, through, the, nara, period, 710, 794, and, into, the, heian, or, fujiwara, period, 794, 1185, with, higher, temperature, firings, new, glazes, followed, green, yellowish, brown, and, white, in, addition, new, styles, and, techniques, of, glazing, emerged, ceramic, wares, that, emerged, from, china, were, processed, with, a, very, similar, beginning, as, japan, the, history, of, chinese, pottery, began, in, the, neolithic, era, about, 4300, bc, down, to, 2000, bc, unlike, japan, which, focused, on, production, of, everyday, wares, china, created, mostly, decorative, pieces, with, few, opportunities, for, industrialization, and, production, of, ceramic, wares, because, china, focused, on, decorative, wares, most, of, their, pottery, was, centered, around, porcelain, instead, of, earthen, wares, seem, almost, everywhere, else, and, they, used, the, potter, s, wheel, for, the, development, of, porcelain, clay, culture, porcelain, took, off, during, the, ming, dynasty, and, the, qing, dynasty, 1644, 1911, when, the, iconic, blue, and, white, porcelain, ceramics, emerged, several, places, in, china, mix, traditional, elements, and, methods, with, modern, design, and, technologies, native, americans, have, been, creating, ceramics, by, hand, and, in, more, modern, eras, started, incorporating, a, wheel, into, their, work, pottery, can, be, identified, in, the, southwest, of, north, american, dating, back, to, 150, ce, and, has, been, an, important, part, of, native, american, culture, for, over, 2, 000, years, historically, native, americans, have, been, using, the, coiling, method, to, achieve, their, decorative, and, functional, pieces, and, the, technology, to, create, an, electric, wheel, did, not, show, up, until, the, arrival, of, europeans, however, smaller, turntables, or, slow, wheels, could, have, been, used, occasionally, the, use, of, the, motor, driven, wheel, has, become, common, in, modern, times, particularly, with, craft, potters, and, educational, institutions, although, human, powered, ones, are, still, in, use, and, are, preferred, by, some, studio, potters, social, consequences, that, can, arrive, of, these, technological, advancements, include, increased, economic, advancements, in, the, sales, of, pottery, created, using, the, potter, s, wheel, and, industrialization, of, the, ceramics, processes, the, potter, s, wheel, greatly, increased, the, production, rate, of, ceramics, which, allowed, for, more, products, to, be, created, with, the, industrialization, of, ceramics, in, japan, ceramics, also, lost, some, of, its, historical, value, and, some, techniques, and, meanings, of, the, ceramics, were, lost, in, the, process, a, skilled, potter, can, quickly, throw, a, vessel, from, up, to, 15, kg, 30, lb, of, clay, alternatively, by, throwing, and, adding, coils, of, clay, then, throwing, again, pots, up, to, four, feet, high, may, be, made, the, heat, of, a, blowlamp, being, used, to, firm, each, thrown, section, before, adding, the, next, coil, in, chinese, manufacturing, very, large, pots, are, made, by, two, throwers, working, simultaneously, in, ancient, egyptian, mythology, the, deity, khnum, was, said, to, have, formed, the, first, humans, on, a, potter, s, wheel
