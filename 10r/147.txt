in, electrical, engineering, a, transformer, is, a, passive, component, that, transfers, electrical, energy, from, one, electrical, circuit, to, another, circuit, or, multiple, circuits, a, varying, current, in, any, coil, of, the, transformer, produces, a, varying, magnetic, flux, in, the, transformer, s, core, which, induces, a, varying, electromotive, force, emf, across, any, other, coils, wound, around, the, same, core, electrical, energy, can, be, transferred, between, separate, coils, without, a, metallic, conductive, connection, between, the, two, circuits, faraday, s, law, of, induction, discovered, in, 1831, describes, the, induced, voltage, effect, in, any, coil, due, to, a, changing, magnetic, flux, encircled, by, the, coil, transformers, are, used, to, change, ac, voltage, levels, such, transformers, being, termed, step, up, or, step, down, type, to, increase, or, decrease, voltage, level, respectively, transformers, can, also, be, used, to, provide, galvanic, isolation, between, circuits, as, well, as, to, couple, stages, of, signal, processing, circuits, since, the, invention, of, the, first, constant, potential, transformer, in, 1885, transformers, have, become, essential, for, the, transmission, distribution, and, utilization, of, alternating, current, electric, power, a, wide, range, of, transformer, designs, is, encountered, in, electronic, and, electric, power, applications, transformers, range, in, size, from, rf, transformers, less, than, a, cubic, centimeter, in, volume, to, units, weighing, hundreds, of, tons, used, to, interconnect, the, power, grid, ideal, transformer, equations, by, faraday, s, law, of, induction, where, v, displaystyle, v, is, the, instantaneous, voltage, n, displaystyle, n, is, the, number, of, turns, in, a, winding, d, dt, is, the, derivative, of, the, magnetic, flux, through, one, turn, of, the, winding, over, time, t, and, subscripts, p, and, s, denotes, primary, and, secondary, combining, the, ratio, of, eq, 1, eq, 2, where, for, a, step, up, transformer, a, 1, and, for, a, step, down, transformer, a, 1, by, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, apparent, real, and, reactive, power, are, each, conserved, in, the, input, and, output, where, s, displaystyle, s, is, apparent, power, and, i, displaystyle, i, is, current, combining, eq, 3, eq, 4, with, this, endnote, gives, the, ideal, transformer, identity, where, l, displaystyle, l, is, winding, self, inductance, by, ohm, s, law, and, ideal, transformer, identity, where, z, l, displaystyle, z, text, l, is, the, load, impedance, of, the, secondary, circuit, z, l, displaystyle, z, text, l, is, the, apparent, load, or, driving, point, impedance, of, the, primary, circuit, the, superscript, displaystyle, denoting, referred, to, the, primary, an, ideal, transformer, is, linear, lossless, and, perfectly, coupled, perfect, coupling, implies, infinitely, high, core, magnetic, permeability, and, winding, inductance, and, zero, net, magnetomotive, force, i, e, i, p, n, p, i, s, n, s, 0, a, varying, current, in, the, transformer, s, primary, winding, creates, a, varying, magnetic, flux, in, the, transformer, core, which, is, also, encircled, by, the, secondary, winding, this, varying, flux, at, the, secondary, winding, induces, a, varying, electromotive, force, or, voltage, in, the, secondary, winding, this, electromagnetic, induction, phenomenon, is, the, basis, of, transformer, action, and, in, accordance, with, lenz, s, law, the, secondary, current, so, produced, creates, a, flux, equal, and, opposite, to, that, produced, by, the, primary, winding, the, windings, are, wound, around, a, core, of, infinitely, high, magnetic, permeability, so, that, all, of, the, magnetic, flux, passes, through, both, the, primary, and, secondary, windings, with, a, voltage, source, connected, to, the, primary, winding, and, a, load, connected, to, the, secondary, winding, the, transformer, currents, flow, in, the, indicated, directions, and, the, core, magnetomotive, force, cancels, to, zero, according, to, faraday, s, law, since, the, same, magnetic, flux, passes, through, both, the, primary, and, secondary, windings, in, an, ideal, transformer, a, voltage, is, induced, in, each, winding, proportional, to, its, number, of, turns, the, transformer, winding, voltage, ratio, is, equal, to, the, winding, turns, ratio, an, ideal, transformer, is, a, reasonable, approximation, for, a, typical, commercial, transformer, with, voltage, ratio, and, winding, turns, ratio, both, being, inversely, proportional, to, the, corresponding, current, ratio, the, load, impedance, referred, to, the, primary, circuit, is, equal, to, the, turns, ratio, squared, times, the, secondary, circuit, load, impedance, the, ideal, transformer, model, neglects, many, basic, linear, aspects, of, real, transformers, including, unavoidable, losses, and, inefficiencies, a, core, losses, collectively, called, magnetizing, current, losses, consisting, of, b, unlike, the, ideal, model, the, windings, in, a, real, transformer, have, non, zero, resistances, and, inductances, associated, with, c, similar, to, an, inductor, parasitic, capacitance, and, self, resonance, phenomenon, due, to, the, electric, field, distribution, three, kinds, of, parasitic, capacitance, are, usually, considered, and, the, closed, loop, equations, are, provided, inclusion, of, capacitance, into, the, transformer, model, is, complicated, and, is, rarely, attempted, the, real, transformer, model, s, equivalent, circuit, shown, below, does, not, include, parasitic, capacitance, however, the, capacitance, effect, can, be, measured, by, comparing, open, circuit, inductance, i, e, the, inductance, of, a, primary, winding, when, the, secondary, circuit, is, open, to, a, short, circuit, inductance, when, the, secondary, winding, is, shorted, the, ideal, transformer, model, assumes, that, all, flux, generated, by, the, primary, winding, links, all, the, turns, of, every, winding, including, itself, in, practice, some, flux, traverses, paths, that, take, it, outside, the, windings, such, flux, is, termed, leakage, flux, and, results, in, leakage, inductance, in, series, with, the, mutually, coupled, transformer, windings, leakage, flux, results, in, energy, being, alternately, stored, in, and, discharged, from, the, magnetic, fields, with, each, cycle, of, the, power, supply, it, is, not, directly, a, power, loss, but, results, in, inferior, voltage, regulation, causing, the, secondary, voltage, not, to, be, directly, proportional, to, the, primary, voltage, particularly, under, heavy, load, transformers, are, therefore, normally, designed, to, have, very, low, leakage, inductance, in, some, applications, increased, leakage, is, desired, and, long, magnetic, paths, air, gaps, or, magnetic, bypass, shunts, may, deliberately, be, introduced, in, a, transformer, design, to, limit, the, short, circuit, current, it, will, supply, leaky, transformers, may, be, used, to, supply, loads, that, exhibit, negative, resistance, such, as, electric, arcs, mercury, and, sodium, vapor, lamps, and, neon, signs, or, for, safely, handling, loads, that, become, periodically, short, circuited, such, as, electric, arc, welders, 485, air, gaps, are, also, used, to, keep, a, transformer, from, saturating, especially, audio, frequency, transformers, in, circuits, that, have, a, dc, component, flowing, in, the, windings, a, saturable, reactor, exploits, saturation, of, the, core, to, control, alternating, current, knowledge, of, leakage, inductance, is, also, useful, when, transformers, are, operated, in, parallel, it, can, be, shown, that, if, the, percent, impedance, and, associated, winding, leakage, reactance, to, resistance, x, r, ratio, of, two, transformers, were, the, same, the, transformers, would, share, the, load, power, in, proportion, to, their, respective, ratings, however, the, impedance, tolerances, of, commercial, transformers, are, significant, also, the, impedance, and, x, r, ratio, of, different, capacity, transformers, tends, to, vary, referring, to, the, diagram, a, practical, transformer, s, physical, behavior, may, be, represented, by, an, equivalent, circuit, model, which, can, incorporate, an, ideal, transformer, winding, joule, losses, and, leakage, reactance, are, represented, by, the, following, series, loop, impedances, of, the, model, in, normal, course, of, circuit, equivalence, transformation, r, s, and, x, s, are, in, practice, usually, referred, to, the, primary, side, by, multiplying, these, impedances, by, the, turns, ratio, squared, n, p, n, s, 2, a, 2, core, loss, and, reactance, is, represented, by, the, following, shunt, leg, impedances, of, the, model, r, c, and, x, m, are, collectively, termed, the, magnetizing, branch, of, the, model, core, losses, are, caused, mostly, by, hysteresis, and, eddy, current, effects, in, the, core, and, are, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, core, flux, for, operation, at, a, given, frequency, 142, 143, the, finite, permeability, core, requires, a, magnetizing, current, i, m, to, maintain, mutual, flux, in, the, core, magnetizing, current, is, in, phase, with, the, flux, the, relationship, between, the, two, being, non, linear, due, to, saturation, effects, however, all, impedances, of, the, equivalent, circuit, shown, are, by, definition, linear, and, such, non, linearity, effects, are, not, typically, reflected, in, transformer, equivalent, circuits, 142, with, sinusoidal, supply, core, flux, lags, the, induced, emf, by, 90, with, open, circuited, secondary, winding, magnetizing, branch, current, i, 0, equals, transformer, no, load, current, the, resulting, model, though, sometimes, termed, exact, equivalent, circuit, based, on, linearity, assumptions, retains, a, number, of, approximations, analysis, may, be, simplified, by, assuming, that, magnetizing, branch, impedance, is, relatively, high, and, relocating, the, branch, to, the, left, of, the, primary, impedances, this, introduces, error, but, allows, combination, of, primary, and, referred, secondary, resistances, and, reactance, by, simple, summation, as, two, series, impedances, transformer, equivalent, circuit, impedance, and, transformer, ratio, parameters, can, be, derived, from, the, following, tests, open, circuit, test, short, circuit, test, winding, resistance, test, and, transformer, ratio, test, if, the, flux, in, the, core, is, purely, sinusoidal, the, relationship, for, either, winding, between, its, rms, voltage, e, rms, of, the, winding, and, the, supply, frequency, f, number, of, turns, n, core, cross, sectional, area, a, in, m, 2, and, peak, magnetic, flux, density, b, peak, in, wb, m, 2, or, t, tesla, is, given, by, the, universal, emf, equation, a, dot, convention, is, often, used, in, transformer, circuit, diagrams, nameplates, or, terminal, markings, to, define, the, relative, polarity, of, transformer, windings, positively, increasing, instantaneous, current, entering, the, primary, winding, s, dot, end, induces, positive, polarity, voltage, exiting, the, secondary, winding, s, dot, end, three, phase, transformers, used, in, electric, power, systems, will, have, a, nameplate, that, indicate, the, phase, relationships, between, their, terminals, this, may, be, in, the, form, of, a, phasor, diagram, or, using, an, alpha, numeric, code, to, show, the, type, of, internal, connection, wye, or, delta, for, each, winding, the, emf, of, a, transformer, at, a, given, flux, increases, with, frequency, by, operating, at, higher, frequencies, transformers, can, be, physically, more, compact, because, a, given, core, is, able, to, transfer, more, power, without, reaching, saturation, and, fewer, turns, are, needed, to, achieve, the, same, impedance, however, properties, such, as, core, loss, and, conductor, skin, effect, also, increase, with, frequency, aircraft, and, military, equipment, employ, 400, hz, power, supplies, which, reduce, core, and, winding, weight, conversely, frequencies, used, for, some, railway, electrification, systems, were, much, lower, e, g, 16, 7, hz, and, 25, hz, than, normal, utility, frequencies, 50, 60, hz, for, historical, reasons, concerned, mainly, with, the, limitations, of, early, electric, traction, motors, consequently, the, transformers, used, to, step, down, the, high, overhead, line, voltages, were, much, larger, and, heavier, for, the, same, power, rating, than, those, required, for, the, higher, frequencies, operation, of, a, transformer, at, its, designed, voltage, but, at, a, higher, frequency, than, intended, will, lead, to, reduced, magnetizing, current, at, a, lower, frequency, the, magnetizing, current, will, increase, operation, of, a, large, transformer, at, other, than, its, design, frequency, may, require, assessment, of, voltages, losses, and, cooling, to, establish, if, safe, operation, is, practical, transformers, may, require, protective, relays, to, protect, the, transformer, from, overvoltage, at, higher, than, rated, frequency, one, example, is, in, traction, transformers, used, for, electric, multiple, unit, and, high, speed, train, service, operating, across, regions, with, different, electrical, standards, the, converter, equipment, and, traction, transformers, have, to, accommodate, different, input, frequencies, and, voltage, ranging, from, as, high, as, 50, hz, down, to, 16, 7, hz, and, rated, up, to, 25, kv, at, much, higher, frequencies, the, transformer, core, size, required, drops, dramatically, a, physically, small, transformer, can, handle, power, levels, that, would, require, a, massive, iron, core, at, mains, frequency, the, development, of, switching, power, semiconductor, devices, made, switch, mode, power, supplies, viable, to, generate, a, high, frequency, then, change, the, voltage, level, with, a, small, transformer, transformers, for, higher, frequency, applications, such, as, smps, typically, use, core, materials, with, much, lower, hysteresis, and, eddy, current, losses, than, those, for, 50, 60, hz, primary, examples, are, iron, powder, and, ferrite, cores, the, lower, frequency, dependant, losses, of, these, cores, often, is, at, the, expense, of, flux, density, at, saturation, for, instance, ferrite, saturation, occurs, at, a, substantially, lower, flux, density, than, laminated, iron, large, power, transformers, are, vulnerable, to, insulation, failure, due, to, transient, voltages, with, high, frequency, components, such, as, caused, in, switching, or, by, lightning, transformer, energy, losses, are, dominated, by, winding, and, core, losses, transformers, efficiency, tends, to, improve, with, increasing, transformer, capacity, the, efficiency, of, typical, distribution, transformers, is, between, about, 98, and, 99, percent, as, transformer, losses, vary, with, load, it, is, often, useful, to, tabulate, no, load, loss, full, load, loss, half, load, loss, and, so, on, hysteresis, and, eddy, current, losses, are, constant, at, all, load, levels, and, dominate, at, no, load, while, winding, loss, increases, as, load, increases, the, no, load, loss, can, be, significant, so, that, even, an, idle, transformer, constitutes, a, drain, on, the, electrical, supply, designing, energy, efficient, transformers, for, lower, loss, requires, a, larger, core, good, quality, silicon, steel, or, even, amorphous, steel, for, the, core, and, thicker, wire, increasing, initial, cost, the, choice, of, construction, represents, a, trade, off, between, initial, cost, and, operating, cost, transformer, losses, arise, from, closed, core, transformers, are, constructed, in, core, form, or, shell, form, when, windings, surround, the, core, the, transformer, is, core, form, when, windings, are, surrounded, by, the, core, the, transformer, is, shell, form, shell, form, design, may, be, more, prevalent, than, core, form, design, for, distribution, transformer, applications, due, to, the, relative, ease, in, stacking, the, core, around, winding, coils, core, form, design, tends, to, as, a, general, rule, be, more, economical, and, therefore, more, prevalent, than, shell, form, design, for, high, voltage, power, transformer, applications, at, the, lower, end, of, their, voltage, and, power, rating, ranges, less, than, or, equal, to, nominally, 230, kv, or, 75, mva, at, higher, voltage, and, power, ratings, shell, form, transformers, tend, to, be, more, prevalent, shell, form, design, tends, to, be, preferred, for, extra, high, voltage, and, higher, mva, applications, because, though, more, labor, intensive, to, manufacture, shell, form, transformers, are, characterized, as, having, inherently, better, kva, to, weight, ratio, better, short, circuit, strength, characteristics, and, higher, immunity, to, transit, damage, transformers, for, use, at, power, or, audio, frequencies, typically, have, cores, made, of, high, permeability, silicon, steel, the, steel, has, a, permeability, many, times, that, of, free, space, and, the, core, thus, serves, to, greatly, reduce, the, magnetizing, current, and, confine, the, flux, to, a, path, which, closely, couples, the, windings, early, transformer, developers, soon, realized, that, cores, constructed, from, solid, iron, resulted, in, prohibitive, eddy, current, losses, and, their, designs, mitigated, this, effect, with, cores, consisting, of, bundles, of, insulated, iron, wires, later, designs, constructed, the, core, by, stacking, layers, of, thin, steel, laminations, a, principle, that, has, remained, in, use, each, lamination, is, insulated, from, its, neighbors, by, a, thin, non, conducting, layer, of, insulation, the, transformer, universal, emf, equation, can, be, used, to, calculate, the, core, cross, sectional, area, for, a, preferred, level, of, magnetic, flux, the, effect, of, laminations, is, to, confine, eddy, currents, to, highly, elliptical, paths, that, enclose, little, flux, and, so, reduce, their, magnitude, thinner, laminations, reduce, losses, but, are, more, laborious, and, expensive, to, construct, thin, laminations, are, generally, used, on, high, frequency, transformers, with, some, of, very, thin, steel, laminations, able, to, operate, up, to, 10, khz, one, common, design, of, laminated, core, is, made, from, interleaved, stacks, of, e, shaped, steel, sheets, capped, with, i, shaped, pieces, leading, to, its, name, of, e, i, transformer, such, a, design, tends, to, exhibit, more, losses, but, is, very, economical, to, manufacture, the, cut, core, or, c, core, type, is, made, by, winding, a, steel, strip, around, a, rectangular, form, and, then, bonding, the, layers, together, it, is, then, cut, in, two, forming, two, c, shapes, and, the, core, assembled, by, binding, the, two, c, halves, together, with, a, steel, strap, they, have, the, advantage, that, the, flux, is, always, oriented, parallel, to, the, metal, grains, reducing, reluctance, a, steel, core, s, remanence, means, that, it, retains, a, static, magnetic, field, when, power, is, removed, when, power, is, then, reapplied, the, residual, field, will, cause, a, high, inrush, current, until, the, effect, of, the, remaining, magnetism, is, reduced, usually, after, a, few, cycles, of, the, applied, ac, waveform, overcurrent, protection, devices, such, as, fuses, must, be, selected, to, allow, this, harmless, inrush, to, pass, on, transformers, connected, to, long, overhead, power, transmission, lines, induced, currents, due, to, geomagnetic, disturbances, during, solar, storms, can, cause, saturation, of, the, core, and, operation, of, transformer, protection, devices, distribution, transformers, can, achieve, low, no, load, losses, by, using, cores, made, with, low, loss, high, permeability, silicon, steel, or, amorphous, non, crystalline, metal, alloy, the, higher, initial, cost, of, the, core, material, is, offset, over, the, life, of, the, transformer, by, its, lower, losses, at, light, load, powdered, iron, cores, are, used, in, circuits, such, as, switch, mode, power, supplies, that, operate, above, mains, frequencies, and, up, to, a, few, tens, of, kilohertz, these, materials, combine, high, magnetic, permeability, with, high, bulk, electrical, resistivity, for, frequencies, extending, beyond, the, vhf, band, cores, made, from, non, conductive, magnetic, ceramic, materials, called, ferrites, are, common, some, radio, frequency, transformers, also, have, movable, cores, sometimes, called, slugs, which, allow, adjustment, of, the, coupling, coefficient, and, bandwidth, of, tuned, radio, frequency, circuits, toroidal, transformers, are, built, around, a, ring, shaped, core, which, depending, on, operating, frequency, is, made, from, a, long, strip, of, silicon, steel, or, permalloy, wound, into, a, coil, powdered, iron, or, ferrite, a, strip, construction, ensures, that, the, grain, boundaries, are, optimally, aligned, improving, the, transformer, s, efficiency, by, reducing, the, core, s, reluctance, the, closed, ring, shape, eliminates, air, gaps, inherent, in, the, construction, of, an, e, i, core, 485, the, cross, section, of, the, ring, is, usually, square, or, rectangular, but, more, expensive, cores, with, circular, cross, sections, are, also, available, the, primary, and, secondary, coils, are, often, wound, concentrically, to, cover, the, entire, surface, of, the, core, this, minimizes, the, length, of, wire, needed, and, provides, screening, to, minimize, the, core, s, magnetic, field, from, generating, electromagnetic, interference, toroidal, transformers, are, more, efficient, than, the, cheaper, laminated, e, i, types, for, a, similar, power, level, other, advantages, compared, to, e, i, types, include, smaller, size, about, half, lower, weight, about, half, less, mechanical, hum, making, them, superior, in, audio, amplifiers, lower, exterior, magnetic, field, about, one, tenth, low, off, load, losses, making, them, more, efficient, in, standby, circuits, single, bolt, mounting, and, greater, choice, of, shapes, the, main, disadvantages, are, higher, cost, and, limited, power, capacity, see, classification, parameters, below, because, of, the, lack, of, a, residual, gap, in, the, magnetic, path, toroidal, transformers, also, tend, to, exhibit, higher, inrush, current, compared, to, laminated, e, i, types, ferrite, toroidal, cores, are, used, at, higher, frequencies, typically, between, a, few, tens, of, kilohertz, to, hundreds, of, megahertz, to, reduce, losses, physical, size, and, weight, of, inductive, components, a, drawback, of, toroidal, transformer, construction, is, the, higher, labor, cost, of, winding, this, is, because, it, is, necessary, to, pass, the, entire, length, of, a, coil, winding, through, the, core, aperture, each, time, a, single, turn, is, added, to, the, coil, as, a, consequence, toroidal, transformers, rated, more, than, a, few, kva, are, uncommon, relatively, few, toroids, are, offered, with, power, ratings, above, 10, kva, and, practically, none, above, 25, kva, small, distribution, transformers, may, achieve, some, of, the, benefits, of, a, toroidal, core, by, splitting, it, and, forcing, it, open, then, inserting, a, bobbin, containing, primary, and, secondary, windings, a, transformer, can, be, produced, by, placing, the, windings, near, each, other, an, arrangement, termed, an, air, core, transformer, an, air, core, transformer, eliminates, loss, due, to, hysteresis, in, the, core, material, the, magnetizing, inductance, is, drastically, reduced, by, the, lack, of, a, magnetic, core, resulting, in, large, magnetizing, currents, and, losses, if, used, at, low, frequencies, air, core, transformers, are, unsuitable, for, use, in, power, distribution, but, are, frequently, employed, in, radio, frequency, applications, air, cores, are, also, used, for, resonant, transformers, such, as, tesla, coils, where, they, can, achieve, reasonably, low, loss, despite, the, low, magnetizing, inductance, the, electrical, conductor, used, for, the, windings, depends, upon, the, application, but, in, all, cases, the, individual, turns, must, be, electrically, insulated, from, each, other, to, ensure, that, the, current, travels, throughout, every, turn, for, small, transformers, in, which, currents, are, low, and, the, potential, difference, between, adjacent, turns, is, small, the, coils, are, often, wound, from, enamelled, magnet, wire, larger, power, transformers, may, be, wound, with, copper, rectangular, strip, conductors, insulated, by, oil, impregnated, paper, and, blocks, of, pressboard, high, frequency, transformers, operating, in, the, tens, to, hundreds, of, kilohertz, often, have, windings, made, of, braided, litz, wire, to, minimize, the, skin, effect, and, proximity, effect, losses, large, power, transformers, use, multiple, stranded, conductors, as, well, since, even, at, low, power, frequencies, non, uniform, distribution, of, current, would, otherwise, exist, in, high, current, windings, each, strand, is, individually, insulated, and, the, strands, are, arranged, so, that, at, certain, points, in, the, winding, or, throughout, the, whole, winding, each, portion, occupies, different, relative, positions, in, the, complete, conductor, the, transposition, equalizes, the, current, flowing, in, each, strand, of, the, conductor, and, reduces, eddy, current, losses, in, the, winding, itself, the, stranded, conductor, is, also, more, flexible, than, a, solid, conductor, of, similar, size, aiding, manufacture, the, windings, of, signal, transformers, minimize, leakage, inductance, and, stray, capacitance, to, improve, high, frequency, response, coils, are, split, into, sections, and, those, sections, interleaved, between, the, sections, of, the, other, winding, power, frequency, transformers, may, have, taps, at, intermediate, points, on, the, winding, usually, on, the, higher, voltage, winding, side, for, voltage, adjustment, taps, may, be, manually, reconnected, or, a, manual, or, automatic, switch, may, be, provided, for, changing, taps, automatic, on, load, tap, changers, are, used, in, electric, power, transmission, or, distribution, on, equipment, such, as, arc, furnace, transformers, or, for, automatic, voltage, regulators, for, sensitive, loads, audio, frequency, transformers, used, for, the, distribution, of, audio, to, public, address, loudspeakers, have, taps, to, allow, adjustment, of, impedance, to, each, speaker, a, center, tapped, transformer, is, often, used, in, the, output, stage, of, an, audio, power, amplifier, in, a, push, pull, circuit, modulation, transformers, in, am, transmitters, are, very, similar, it, is, a, rule, of, thumb, that, the, life, expectancy, of, electrical, insulation, is, halved, for, about, every, 7, c, to, 10, c, increase, in, operating, temperature, an, instance, of, the, application, of, the, arrhenius, equation, small, dry, type, and, liquid, immersed, transformers, are, often, self, cooled, by, natural, convection, and, radiation, heat, dissipation, as, power, ratings, increase, transformers, are, often, cooled, by, forced, air, cooling, forced, oil, cooling, water, cooling, or, combinations, of, these, large, transformers, are, filled, with, transformer, oil, that, both, cools, and, insulates, the, windings, transformer, oil, is, often, a, highly, refined, mineral, oil, that, cools, the, windings, and, insulation, by, circulating, within, the, transformer, tank, the, mineral, oil, and, paper, insulation, system, has, been, extensively, studied, and, used, for, more, than, 100, years, it, is, estimated, that, 50, of, power, transformers, will, survive, 50, years, of, use, that, the, average, age, of, failure, of, power, transformers, is, about, 10, to, 15, years, and, that, about, 30, of, power, transformer, failures, are, due, to, insulation, and, overloading, failures, prolonged, operation, at, elevated, temperature, degrades, insulating, properties, of, winding, insulation, and, dielectric, coolant, which, not, only, shortens, transformer, life, but, can, ultimately, lead, to, catastrophic, transformer, failure, with, a, great, body, of, empirical, study, as, a, guide, transformer, oil, testing, including, dissolved, gas, analysis, provides, valuable, maintenance, information, building, regulations, in, many, jurisdictions, require, indoor, liquid, filled, transformers, to, either, use, dielectric, fluids, that, are, less, flammable, than, oil, or, be, installed, in, fire, resistant, rooms, air, cooled, dry, transformers, can, be, more, economical, where, they, eliminate, the, cost, of, a, fire, resistant, transformer, room, the, tank, of, liquid, filled, transformers, often, has, radiators, through, which, the, liquid, coolant, circulates, by, natural, convection, or, fins, some, large, transformers, employ, electric, fans, for, forced, air, cooling, pumps, for, forced, liquid, cooling, or, have, heat, exchangers, for, water, cooling, an, oil, immersed, transformer, may, be, equipped, with, a, buchholz, relay, which, depending, on, severity, of, gas, accumulation, due, to, internal, arcing, is, used, to, either, trigger, an, alarm, or, de, energize, the, transformer, oil, immersed, transformer, installations, usually, include, fire, protection, measures, such, as, walls, oil, containment, and, fire, suppression, sprinkler, systems, polychlorinated, biphenyls, pcbs, have, properties, that, once, favored, their, use, as, a, dielectric, coolant, though, concerns, over, their, environmental, persistence, led, to, a, widespread, ban, on, their, use, today, non, toxic, stable, silicone, based, oils, or, fluorinated, hydrocarbons, may, be, used, where, the, expense, of, a, fire, resistant, liquid, offsets, additional, building, cost, for, a, transformer, vault, however, the, long, life, span, of, transformers, can, mean, that, the, potential, for, exposure, can, be, high, long, after, banning, some, transformers, are, gas, insulated, their, windings, are, enclosed, in, sealed, pressurized, tanks, and, often, cooled, by, nitrogen, or, sulfur, hexafluoride, gas, experimental, power, transformers, in, the, 500, 1, 000, kva, range, have, been, built, with, liquid, nitrogen, or, helium, cooled, superconducting, windings, which, eliminates, winding, losses, without, affecting, core, losses, insulation, must, be, provided, between, the, individual, turns, of, the, windings, between, the, windings, between, windings, and, core, and, at, the, terminals, of, the, winding, inter, turn, insulation, of, small, transformers, may, be, a, layer, of, insulating, varnish, on, the, wire, layer, of, paper, or, polymer, films, may, be, inserted, between, layers, of, windings, and, between, primary, and, secondary, windings, a, transformer, may, be, coated, or, dipped, in, a, polymer, resin, to, improve, the, strength, of, windings, and, protect, them, from, moisture, or, corrosion, the, resin, may, be, impregnated, into, the, winding, insulation, using, combinations, of, vacuum, and, pressure, during, the, coating, process, eliminating, all, air, voids, in, the, winding, in, the, limit, the, entire, coil, may, be, placed, in, a, mold, and, resin, cast, around, it, as, a, solid, block, encapsulating, the, windings, large, oil, filled, power, transformers, use, windings, wrapped, with, insulating, paper, which, is, impregnated, with, oil, during, assembly, of, the, transformer, oil, filled, transformers, use, highly, refined, mineral, oil, to, insulate, and, cool, the, windings, and, core, construction, of, oil, filled, transformers, requires, that, the, insulation, covering, the, windings, be, thoroughly, dried, of, residual, moisture, before, the, oil, is, introduced, drying, may, be, done, by, circulating, hot, air, around, the, core, by, circulating, externally, heated, transformer, oil, or, by, vapor, phase, drying, vpd, where, an, evaporated, solvent, transfers, heat, by, condensation, on, the, coil, and, core, for, small, transformers, resistance, heating, by, injection, of, current, into, the, windings, is, used, larger, transformers, are, provided, with, high, voltage, insulated, bushings, made, of, polymers, or, porcelain, a, large, bushing, can, be, a, complex, structure, since, it, must, provide, careful, control, of, the, electric, field, gradient, without, letting, the, transformer, leak, oil, transformers, can, be, classified, in, many, ways, such, as, the, following, various, specific, electrical, application, designs, require, a, variety, of, transformer, types, although, they, all, share, the, basic, characteristic, transformer, principles, they, are, customized, in, construction, or, electrical, properties, for, certain, installation, requirements, or, circuit, conditions, in, electric, power, transmission, transformers, allow, transmission, of, electric, power, at, high, voltages, which, reduces, the, loss, due, to, heating, of, the, wires, this, allows, generating, plants, to, be, located, economically, at, a, distance, from, electrical, consumers, all, but, a, tiny, fraction, of, the, world, s, electrical, power, has, passed, through, a, series, of, transformers, by, the, time, it, reaches, the, consumer, in, many, electronic, devices, a, transformer, is, used, to, convert, voltage, from, the, distribution, wiring, to, convenient, values, for, the, circuit, requirements, either, directly, at, the, power, line, frequency, or, through, a, switch, mode, power, supply, signal, and, audio, transformers, are, used, to, couple, stages, of, amplifiers, and, to, match, devices, such, as, microphones, and, record, players, to, the, input, of, amplifiers, audio, transformers, allowed, telephone, circuits, to, carry, on, a, two, way, conversation, over, a, single, pair, of, wires, a, balun, transformer, converts, a, signal, that, is, referenced, to, ground, to, a, signal, that, has, balanced, voltages, to, ground, such, as, between, external, cables, and, internal, circuits, isolation, transformers, prevent, leakage, of, current, into, the, secondary, circuit, and, are, used, in, medical, equipment, and, at, construction, sites, resonant, transformers, are, used, for, coupling, between, stages, of, radio, receivers, or, in, high, voltage, tesla, coils, electromagnetic, induction, the, principle, of, the, operation, of, the, transformer, was, discovered, independently, by, michael, faraday, in, 1831, and, joseph, henry, in, 1832, only, faraday, furthered, his, experiments, to, the, point, of, working, out, the, equation, describing, the, relationship, between, emf, and, magnetic, flux, now, known, as, faraday, s, law, of, induction, where, e, displaystyle, mathcal, e, is, the, magnitude, of, the, emf, in, volts, and, b, is, the, magnetic, flux, through, the, circuit, in, webers, faraday, performed, early, experiments, on, induction, between, coils, of, wire, including, winding, a, pair, of, coils, around, an, iron, ring, thus, creating, the, first, toroidal, closed, core, transformer, however, he, only, applied, individual, pulses, of, current, to, his, transformer, and, never, discovered, the, relation, between, the, turns, ratio, and, emf, in, the, windings, the, first, type, of, transformer, to, see, wide, use, was, the, induction, coil, invented, by, irish, catholic, rev, nicholas, callan, of, maynooth, college, ireland, in, 1836, he, was, one, of, the, first, researchers, to, realize, the, more, turns, the, secondary, winding, has, in, relation, to, the, primary, winding, the, larger, the, induced, secondary, emf, will, be, induction, coils, evolved, from, scientists, and, inventors, efforts, to, get, higher, voltages, from, batteries, since, batteries, produce, direct, current, dc, rather, than, ac, induction, coils, relied, upon, vibrating, electrical, contacts, that, regularly, interrupted, the, current, in, the, primary, to, create, the, flux, changes, necessary, for, induction, between, the, 1830s, and, the, 1870s, efforts, to, build, better, induction, coils, mostly, by, trial, and, error, slowly, revealed, the, basic, principles, of, transformers, by, the, 1870s, efficient, generators, producing, alternating, current, ac, were, available, and, it, was, found, ac, could, power, an, induction, coil, directly, without, an, interrupter, in, 1876, russian, engineer, pavel, yablochkov, invented, a, lighting, system, based, on, a, set, of, induction, coils, where, the, primary, windings, were, connected, to, a, source, of, ac, the, secondary, windings, could, be, connected, to, several, electric, candles, arc, lamps, of, his, own, design, the, coils, yablochkov, employed, functioned, essentially, as, transformers, in, 1878, the, ganz, factory, budapest, hungary, began, producing, equipment, for, electric, lighting, and, by, 1883, had, installed, over, fifty, systems, in, austria, hungary, their, ac, systems, used, arc, and, incandescent, lamps, generators, and, other, equipment, in, 1882, lucien, gaulard, and, john, dixon, gibbs, first, exhibited, a, device, with, an, initially, widely, criticized, laminated, plate, open, iron, core, called, a, secondary, generator, in, london, then, sold, the, idea, to, the, westinghouse, company, in, the, united, states, in, 1886, they, also, exhibited, the, invention, in, turin, italy, in, 1884, where, it, was, highly, successful, and, adopted, for, an, electric, lighting, system, their, device, used, a, fixed, 1, 1, ratio, to, supply, a, series, circuit, for, the, utilization, load, lamps, the, voltage, of, their, system, was, controlled, by, pushing, in, and, pulling, out, its, open, iron, core, induction, coils, with, open, magnetic, circuits, are, inefficient, at, transferring, power, to, loads, until, about, 1880, the, paradigm, for, ac, power, transmission, from, a, high, voltage, supply, to, a, low, voltage, load, was, a, series, circuit, open, core, transformers, with, a, ratio, near, 1, 1, were, connected, with, their, primaries, in, series, to, allow, use, of, a, high, voltage, for, transmission, while, presenting, a, low, voltage, to, the, lamps, the, inherent, flaw, in, this, method, was, that, turning, off, a, single, lamp, or, other, electric, device, affected, the, voltage, supplied, to, all, others, on, the, same, circuit, many, adjustable, transformer, designs, were, introduced, to, compensate, for, this, problematic, characteristic, of, the, series, circuit, including, those, employing, methods, of, adjusting, the, core, or, bypassing, the, magnetic, flux, around, part, of, a, coil, efficient, practical, transformer, designs, did, not, appear, until, the, 1880s, but, within, a, decade, the, transformer, would, be, instrumental, in, the, war, of, the, currents, and, in, seeing, ac, distribution, systems, triumph, over, their, dc, counterparts, a, position, in, which, they, have, remained, dominant, ever, since, in, the, autumn, of, 1884, k, roly, zipernowsky, ott, bl, thy, and, miksa, d, ri, zbd, three, hungarian, engineers, associated, with, the, ganz, works, had, determined, that, open, core, devices, were, impracticable, as, they, were, incapable, of, reliably, regulating, voltage, the, ganz, factory, had, also, in, the, autumn, of, 1884, made, delivery, of, the, world, s, first, five, high, efficiency, ac, transformers, the, first, of, these, units, having, been, shipped, on, september, 16, 1884, this, first, unit, had, been, manufactured, to, the, following, specifications, 1, 400, w, 40, hz, 120, 72, v, 11, 6, 19, 4, a, ratio, 1, 67, 1, one, phase, shell, form, in, their, joint, 1885, patent, applications, for, novel, transformers, later, called, zbd, transformers, they, described, two, designs, with, closed, magnetic, circuits, where, copper, windings, were, either, wound, around, an, iron, wire, ring, core, or, surrounded, by, an, iron, wire, core, the, two, designs, were, the, first, application, of, the, two, basic, transformer, constructions, in, common, use, to, this, day, termed, core, form, or, shell, form, in, both, designs, the, magnetic, flux, linking, the, primary, and, secondary, windings, traveled, almost, entirely, within, the, confines, of, the, iron, core, with, no, intentional, path, through, air, see, toroidal, cores, below, the, new, transformers, were, 3, 4, times, more, efficient, than, the, open, core, bipolar, devices, of, gaulard, and, gibbs, the, zbd, patents, included, two, other, major, interrelated, innovations, one, concerning, the, use, of, parallel, connected, instead, of, series, connected, utilization, loads, the, other, concerning, the, ability, to, have, high, turns, ratio, transformers, such, that, the, supply, network, voltage, could, be, much, higher, initially, 1, 400, to, 2, 000, v, than, the, voltage, of, utilization, loads, 100, v, initially, preferred, when, employed, in, parallel, connected, electric, distribution, systems, closed, core, transformers, finally, made, it, technically, and, economically, feasible, to, provide, electric, power, for, lighting, in, homes, businesses, and, public, spaces, bl, thy, had, suggested, the, use, of, closed, cores, zipernowsky, had, suggested, the, use, of, parallel, shunt, connections, and, d, ri, had, performed, the, experiments, in, early, 1885, the, three, engineers, also, eliminated, the, problem, of, eddy, current, losses, with, the, invention, of, the, lamination, of, electromagnetic, cores, transformers, today, are, designed, on, the, principles, discovered, by, the, three, engineers, they, also, popularized, the, word, transformer, to, describe, a, device, for, altering, the, emf, of, an, electric, current, although, the, term, had, already, been, in, use, by, 1882, in, 1886, the, zbd, engineers, designed, and, the, ganz, factory, supplied, electrical, equipment, for, the, world, s, first, power, station, that, used, ac, generators, to, power, a, parallel, connected, common, electrical, network, the, steam, powered, rome, cerchi, power, plant, building, on, the, advancement, of, ac, technology, in, europe, george, westinghouse, founded, the, westinghouse, electric, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, on, january, 8, 1886, the, new, firm, became, active, in, developing, alternating, current, ac, electric, infrastructure, throughout, the, united, states, the, edison, electric, light, company, held, an, option, on, the, us, rights, for, the, zbd, transformers, requiring, westinghouse, to, pursue, alternative, designs, on, the, same, principles, george, westinghouse, had, bought, gaulard, and, gibbs, patents, for, 50, 000, in, february, 1886, he, assigned, to, william, stanley, the, task, of, redesign, the, gaulard, and, gibbs, transformer, for, commercial, use, in, united, states, stanley, s, first, patented, design, was, for, induction, coils, with, single, cores, of, soft, iron, and, adjustable, gaps, to, regulate, the, emf, present, in, the, secondary, winding, see, image, this, design, was, first, used, commercially, in, the, us, in, 1886, but, westinghouse, was, intent, on, improving, the, stanley, design, to, make, it, unlike, the, zbd, type, easy, and, cheap, to, produce, westinghouse, stanley, and, associates, soon, developed, a, core, that, was, easier, to, manufacture, consisting, of, a, stack, of, thin, e, shaped, iron, plates, insulated, by, thin, sheets, of, paper, or, other, insulating, material, pre, wound, copper, coils, could, then, be, slid, into, place, and, straight, iron, plates, laid, in, to, create, a, closed, magnetic, circuit, westinghouse, obtained, a, patent, for, the, new, low, cost, design, in, 1887, in, 1889, russian, born, engineer, mikhail, dolivo, dobrovolsky, developed, the, first, three, phase, transformer, at, the, allgemeine, elektricit, ts, gesellschaft, general, electricity, company, in, germany, in, 1891, nikola, tesla, invented, the, tesla, coil, an, air, cored, dual, tuned, resonant, transformer, for, producing, very, high, voltages, at, high, frequency, audio, frequency, transformers, repeating, coils, were, used, by, early, experimenters, in, the, development, of, the, telephone, general, links
