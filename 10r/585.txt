a, polarizer, or, polariser, is, an, optical, filter, that, lets, light, waves, of, a, specific, polarization, pass, through, while, blocking, light, waves, of, other, polarizations, it, can, filter, a, beam, of, light, of, undefined, or, mixed, polarization, into, a, beam, of, well, defined, polarization, known, as, polarized, light, polarizers, are, used, in, many, optical, techniques, and, instruments, polarizers, find, applications, in, photography, and, lcd, technology, in, photography, a, polarizing, filter, can, be, used, to, filter, out, reflections, the, common, types, of, polarizers, are, linear, polarizers, and, circular, polarizers, polarizers, can, also, be, made, for, other, types, of, electromagnetic, waves, besides, visible, light, such, as, radio, waves, microwaves, and, x, rays, linear, polarizers, can, be, divided, into, two, general, categories, absorptive, polarizers, where, the, unwanted, polarization, states, are, absorbed, by, the, device, and, beam, splitting, polarizers, where, the, unpolarized, beam, is, split, into, two, beams, with, opposite, polarization, states, polarizers, which, maintain, the, same, axes, of, polarization, with, varying, angles, of, incidence, are, often, called, cartesian, polarizers, since, the, polarization, vectors, can, be, described, with, simple, cartesian, coordinates, for, example, horizontal, vs, vertical, independent, from, the, orientation, of, the, polarizer, surface, when, the, two, polarization, states, are, relative, to, the, direction, of, a, surface, usually, found, with, fresnel, reflection, they, are, usually, termed, s, and, p, this, distinction, between, cartesian, and, s, p, polarization, can, be, negligible, in, many, cases, but, it, becomes, significant, for, achieving, high, contrast, and, with, wide, angular, spreads, of, the, incident, light, certain, crystals, due, to, the, effects, described, by, crystal, optics, show, dichroism, preferential, absorption, of, light, which, is, polarized, in, particular, directions, they, can, therefore, be, used, as, linear, polarizers, the, best, known, crystal, of, this, type, is, tourmaline, however, this, crystal, is, seldom, used, as, a, polarizer, since, the, dichroic, effect, is, strongly, wavelength, dependent, and, the, crystal, appears, coloured, herapathite, is, also, dichroic, and, is, not, strongly, coloured, but, is, difficult, to, grow, in, large, crystals, a, polaroid, polarizing, filter, functions, similarly, on, an, atomic, scale, to, the, wire, grid, polarizer, it, was, originally, made, of, microscopic, herapathite, crystals, its, current, h, sheet, form, is, made, from, polyvinyl, alcohol, pva, plastic, with, an, iodine, doping, stretching, of, the, sheet, during, manufacture, causes, the, pva, chains, to, align, in, one, particular, direction, valence, electrons, from, the, iodine, dopant, are, able, to, move, linearly, along, the, polymer, chains, but, not, transverse, to, them, so, incident, light, polarized, parallel, to, the, chains, is, absorbed, by, the, sheet, light, polarized, perpendicularly, to, the, chains, is, transmitted, the, durability, and, practicality, of, polaroid, makes, it, the, most, common, type, of, polarizer, in, use, for, example, for, sunglasses, photographic, filters, and, liquid, crystal, displays, it, is, also, much, cheaper, than, other, types, of, polarizer, a, modern, type, of, absorptive, polarizer, is, made, of, elongated, silver, nano, particles, embedded, in, thin, 0, 5, mm, glass, plates, these, polarizers, are, more, durable, and, can, polarize, light, much, better, than, plastic, polaroid, film, achieving, polarization, ratios, as, high, as, 100, 000, 1, and, absorption, of, correctly, polarized, light, as, low, as, 1, 5, such, glass, polarizers, perform, best, for, long, wavelength, infrared, light, and, are, widely, used, in, fiber, optic, communication, beam, splitting, polarizers, split, the, incident, beam, into, two, beams, of, differing, linear, polarization, for, an, ideal, polarizing, beamsplitter, these, would, be, fully, polarized, with, orthogonal, polarizations, for, many, common, beam, splitting, polarizers, however, only, one, of, the, two, output, beams, is, fully, polarized, the, other, contains, a, mixture, of, polarization, states, unlike, absorptive, polarizers, beam, splitting, polarizers, do, not, need, to, absorb, and, dissipate, the, energy, of, the, rejected, polarization, state, and, so, they, are, more, suitable, for, use, with, high, intensity, beams, such, as, laser, light, true, polarizing, beamsplitters, are, also, useful, where, the, two, polarization, components, are, to, be, analyzed, or, used, simultaneously, when, light, reflects, by, fresnel, reflection, at, an, angle, from, an, interface, between, two, transparent, materials, the, reflectivity, is, different, for, light, polarized, in, the, plane, of, incidence, and, light, polarized, perpendicular, to, it, light, polarized, in, the, plane, is, said, to, be, p, polarized, while, that, polarized, perpendicular, to, it, is, s, polarized, at, a, special, angle, known, as, brewster, s, angle, no, p, polarized, light, is, reflected, from, the, surface, thus, all, reflected, light, must, be, s, polarized, with, an, electric, field, perpendicular, to, the, plane, of, incidence, a, simple, linear, polarizer, can, be, made, by, tilting, a, stack, of, glass, plates, at, brewster, s, angle, to, the, beam, some, of, the, s, polarized, light, is, reflected, from, each, surface, of, each, plate, for, a, stack, of, plates, each, reflection, depletes, the, incident, beam, of, s, polarized, light, leaving, a, greater, fraction, of, p, polarized, light, in, the, transmitted, beam, at, each, stage, for, visible, light, in, air, and, typical, glass, brewster, s, angle, is, about, 57, and, about, 16, of, the, s, polarized, light, present, in, the, beam, is, reflected, for, each, air, to, glass, or, glass, to, air, transition, it, takes, many, plates, to, achieve, even, mediocre, polarization, of, the, transmitted, beam, with, this, approach, for, a, stack, of, 10, plates, 20, reflections, about, 3, 1, 0, 16, 20, of, the, s, polarized, light, is, transmitted, the, reflected, beam, while, fully, polarized, is, spread, out, and, may, not, be, very, useful, a, more, useful, polarized, beam, can, be, obtained, by, tilting, the, pile, of, plates, at, a, steeper, angle, to, the, incident, beam, counterintuitively, using, incident, angles, greater, than, brewster, s, angle, yields, a, higher, degree, of, polarization, of, the, transmitted, beam, at, the, expense, of, decreased, overall, transmission, for, angles, of, incidence, steeper, than, 80, the, polarization, of, the, transmitted, beam, can, approach, 100, with, as, few, as, four, plates, although, the, transmitted, intensity, is, very, low, in, this, case, adding, more, plates, and, reducing, the, angle, allows, a, better, compromise, between, transmission, and, polarization, to, be, achieved, because, their, polarization, vectors, depend, on, incidence, angle, polarizers, based, on, fresnel, reflection, inherently, tend, to, produce, s, p, polarization, rather, than, cartesian, polarization, which, limits, their, use, in, some, applications, other, linear, polarizers, exploit, the, birefringent, properties, of, crystals, such, as, quartz, and, calcite, in, these, crystals, a, beam, of, unpolarized, light, incident, on, their, surface, is, split, by, refraction, into, two, rays, snell, s, law, holds, for, both, of, these, rays, the, ordinary, or, o, ray, and, the, extraordinary, or, e, ray, with, each, ray, experiencing, a, different, index, of, refraction, this, is, called, double, refraction, in, general, the, two, rays, will, be, in, different, polarization, states, though, not, in, linear, polarization, states, except, for, certain, propagation, directions, relative, to, the, crystal, axis, a, nicol, prism, was, an, early, type, of, birefringent, polarizer, that, consists, of, a, crystal, of, calcite, which, has, been, split, and, rejoined, with, canada, balsam, the, crystal, is, cut, such, that, the, o, and, e, rays, are, in, orthogonal, linear, polarization, states, total, internal, reflection, of, the, o, ray, occurs, at, the, balsam, interface, since, it, experiences, a, larger, refractive, index, in, calcite, than, in, the, balsam, and, the, ray, is, deflected, to, the, side, of, the, crystal, the, e, ray, which, sees, a, smaller, refractive, index, in, the, calcite, is, transmitted, through, the, interface, without, deflection, nicol, prisms, produce, a, very, high, purity, of, polarized, light, and, were, extensively, used, in, microscopy, though, in, modern, use, they, have, been, mostly, replaced, with, alternatives, such, as, the, glan, thompson, prism, glan, foucault, prism, and, glan, taylor, prism, these, prisms, are, not, true, polarizing, beamsplitters, since, only, the, transmitted, beam, is, fully, polarized, a, wollaston, prism, is, another, birefringent, polarizer, consisting, of, two, triangular, calcite, prisms, with, orthogonal, crystal, axes, that, are, cemented, together, at, the, internal, interface, an, unpolarized, beam, splits, into, two, linearly, polarized, rays, which, leave, the, prism, at, a, divergence, angle, of, 15, 45, the, rochon, and, s, narmont, prisms, are, similar, but, use, different, optical, axis, orientations, in, the, two, prisms, the, s, narmont, prism, is, air, spaced, unlike, the, wollaston, and, rochon, prisms, these, prisms, truly, split, the, beam, into, two, fully, polarized, beams, with, perpendicular, polarizations, the, nomarski, prism, is, a, variant, of, the, wollaston, prism, which, is, widely, used, in, differential, interference, contrast, microscopy, thin, film, linear, polarizers, also, known, as, tfpn, are, glass, substrates, on, which, a, special, optical, coating, is, applied, either, brewster, s, angle, reflections, or, interference, effects, in, the, film, cause, them, to, act, as, beam, splitting, polarizers, the, substrate, for, the, film, can, either, be, a, plate, which, is, inserted, into, the, beam, at, a, particular, angle, or, a, wedge, of, glass, that, is, cemented, to, a, second, wedge, to, form, a, cube, with, the, film, cutting, diagonally, across, the, center, one, form, of, this, is, the, very, common, macneille, cube, thin, film, polarizers, generally, do, not, perform, as, well, as, glan, type, polarizers, but, they, are, inexpensive, and, provide, two, beams, that, are, about, equally, well, polarized, the, cube, type, polarizers, generally, perform, better, than, the, plate, polarizers, the, former, are, easily, confused, with, glan, type, birefringent, polarizers, one, of, the, simplest, linear, polarizers, is, the, wire, grid, polarizer, wgp, which, consists, of, many, fine, parallel, metallic, wires, placed, in, a, plane, wgps, mostly, reflect, the, non, transmitted, polarization, and, can, thus, be, used, as, polarizing, beam, splitters, the, parasitic, absorption, is, relatively, high, compared, to, most, of, the, dielectric, polarizers, though, much, lower, than, in, absorptive, polarizers, electromagnetic, waves, that, have, a, component, of, their, electric, fields, aligned, parallel, to, the, wires, will, induce, the, movement, of, electrons, along, the, length, of, the, wires, since, the, electrons, are, free, to, move, in, this, direction, the, polarizer, behaves, in, a, similar, manner, to, the, surface, of, a, metal, when, reflecting, light, and, the, wave, is, reflected, backwards, along, the, incident, beam, minus, a, small, amount, of, energy, lost, to, joule, heating, of, the, wire, for, waves, with, electric, fields, perpendicular, to, the, wires, the, electrons, cannot, move, very, far, across, the, width, of, each, wire, therefore, little, energy, is, reflected, and, the, incident, wave, is, able, to, pass, through, the, grid, in, this, case, the, grid, behaves, like, a, dielectric, material, overall, this, causes, the, transmitted, wave, to, be, linearly, polarized, with, an, electric, field, completely, perpendicular, to, the, wires, the, hypothesis, that, the, waves, slip, through, the, gaps, between, the, wires, is, incorrect, for, practical, purposes, the, separation, between, wires, must, be, less, than, the, wavelength, of, the, incident, radiation, in, addition, the, width, of, each, wire, should, be, small, compared, to, the, spacing, between, wires, therefore, it, is, relatively, easy, to, construct, wire, grid, polarizers, for, microwaves, far, infrared, and, mid, infrared, radiation, for, far, infrared, optics, the, polarizer, can, be, even, made, as, free, standing, mesh, entirely, without, transmissive, optics, in, addition, advanced, lithographic, techniques, can, also, build, very, tight, pitch, metallic, grids, typ, 50, 100, nm, allowing, for, the, polarization, of, visible, or, infrared, light, to, a, useful, degree, since, the, degree, of, polarization, depends, little, on, wavelength, and, angle, of, incidence, they, are, used, for, broad, band, applications, such, as, projection, analytical, solutions, using, rigorous, coupled, wave, analysis, for, wire, grid, polarizers, have, shown, that, for, electric, field, components, perpendicular, to, the, wires, the, medium, behaves, like, a, dielectric, and, for, electric, field, components, parallel, to, the, wires, the, medium, behaves, like, a, metal, reflective, malus, law, m, l, u, s, which, is, named, after, tienne, louis, malus, says, that, when, a, perfect, polarizer, is, placed, in, a, polarized, beam, of, light, the, irradiance, i, of, the, light, that, passes, through, is, given, by, where, i, 0, is, the, initial, intensity, and, i, is, the, angle, between, the, light, s, initial, polarization, direction, and, the, axis, of, the, polarizer, a, beam, of, unpolarized, light, can, be, thought, of, as, containing, a, uniform, mixture, of, linear, polarizations, at, all, possible, angles, since, the, average, value, of, cos, 2, displaystyle, cos, 2, theta, is, 1, 2, the, transmission, coefficient, becomes, in, practice, some, light, is, lost, in, the, polarizer, and, the, actual, transmission, will, be, somewhat, lower, than, this, around, 38, for, polaroid, type, polarizers, but, considerably, higher, 49, 9, for, some, birefringent, prism, types, if, two, polarizers, are, placed, one, after, another, the, second, polarizer, is, generally, called, an, analyzer, the, mutual, angle, between, their, polarizing, axes, gives, the, value, of, in, malus, s, law, if, the, two, axes, are, orthogonal, the, polarizers, are, crossed, and, in, theory, no, light, is, transmitted, though, again, practically, speaking, no, polarizer, is, perfect, and, the, transmission, is, not, exactly, zero, for, example, crossed, polaroid, sheets, appear, slightly, blue, in, colour, because, their, extinction, ratio, is, better, in, the, red, if, a, transparent, object, is, placed, between, the, crossed, polarizers, any, polarization, effects, present, in, the, sample, such, as, birefringence, will, be, shown, as, an, increase, in, transmission, this, effect, is, used, in, polarimetry, to, measure, the, optical, activity, of, a, sample, real, polarizers, are, also, not, perfect, blockers, of, the, polarization, orthogonal, to, their, polarization, axis, the, ratio, of, the, transmission, of, the, unwanted, component, to, the, wanted, component, is, called, the, extinction, ratio, and, varies, from, around, 1, 500, for, polaroid, to, about, 1, 10, 6, for, glan, taylor, prism, polarizers, in, x, ray, the, malus, law, relativistic, form, where, f, 0, displaystyle, f, 0, frequency, of, the, polarized, radiation, falling, on, the, polarizer, f, displaystyle, f, frequency, of, the, radiation, passes, through, polarizer, displaystyle, lambda, compton, wavelength, of, electron, c, displaystyle, c, speed, of, light, in, vacuum, circular, polarizers, cpl, or, circular, polarizing, filters, can, be, used, to, create, circularly, polarized, light, or, alternatively, to, selectively, absorb, or, pass, clockwise, and, counter, clockwise, circularly, polarized, light, they, are, used, as, polarizing, filters, in, photography, to, reduce, oblique, reflections, from, non, metallic, surfaces, and, are, the, lenses, of, the, 3d, glasses, worn, for, viewing, some, stereoscopic, movies, notably, the, reald, 3d, variety, where, the, polarization, of, light, is, used, to, differentiate, which, image, should, be, seen, by, the, left, and, right, eye, there, are, several, ways, to, create, circularly, polarized, light, the, cheapest, and, most, common, involves, placing, a, quarter, wave, plate, after, a, linear, polarizer, and, directing, unpolarized, light, through, the, linear, polarizer, the, linearly, polarized, light, leaving, the, linear, polarizer, is, transformed, into, circularly, polarized, light, by, the, quarter, wave, plate, the, transmission, axis, of, the, linear, polarizer, needs, to, be, half, way, 45, between, the, fast, and, slow, axes, of, the, quarter, wave, plate, in, the, arrangement, above, the, transmission, axis, of, the, linear, polarizer, is, at, a, positive, 45, angle, relative, to, the, right, horizontal, and, is, represented, with, an, orange, line, the, quarter, wave, plate, has, a, horizontal, slow, axis, and, a, vertical, fast, axis, and, they, are, also, represented, using, orange, lines, in, this, instance, the, unpolarized, light, entering, the, linear, polarizer, is, displayed, as, a, single, wave, whose, amplitude, and, angle, of, linear, polarization, are, suddenly, changing, when, one, attempts, to, pass, unpolarized, light, through, the, linear, polarizer, only, light, that, has, its, electric, field, at, the, positive, 45, angle, leaves, the, linear, polarizer, and, enters, the, quarter, wave, plate, in, the, illustration, the, three, wavelengths, of, unpolarized, light, represented, would, be, transformed, into, the, three, wavelengths, of, linearly, polarized, light, on, the, other, side, of, the, linear, polarizer, in, the, illustration, toward, the, right, is, the, electric, field, of, the, linearly, polarized, light, just, before, it, enters, the, quarter, wave, plate, the, red, line, and, associated, field, vectors, represent, how, the, magnitude, and, direction, of, the, electric, field, varies, along, the, direction, of, travel, for, this, plane, electromagnetic, wave, each, vector, represents, the, magnitude, and, direction, of, the, electric, field, for, an, entire, plane, that, is, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, travel, refer, to, these, two, images, in, the, plane, wave, article, to, better, appreciate, this, light, and, all, other, electromagnetic, waves, have, a, magnetic, field, which, is, in, phase, with, and, perpendicular, to, the, electric, field, being, displayed, in, these, illustrations, to, understand, the, effect, the, quarter, wave, plate, has, on, the, linearly, polarized, light, it, is, useful, to, think, of, the, light, as, being, divided, into, two, components, which, are, at, right, angles, orthogonal, to, each, other, towards, this, end, the, blue, and, green, lines, are, projections, of, the, red, line, onto, the, vertical, and, horizontal, planes, respectively, and, represent, how, the, electric, field, changes, in, the, direction, of, those, two, planes, the, two, components, have, the, same, amplitude, and, are, in, phase, because, the, quarter, wave, plate, is, made, of, a, birefringent, material, when, in, the, wave, plate, the, light, travels, at, different, speeds, depending, on, the, direction, of, its, electric, field, this, means, that, the, horizontal, component, which, is, along, the, slow, axis, of, the, wave, plate, will, travel, at, a, slower, speed, than, the, component, that, is, directed, along, the, vertical, fast, axis, initially, the, two, components, are, in, phase, but, as, the, two, components, travel, through, the, wave, plate, the, horizontal, component, of, the, light, drifts, farther, behind, that, of, the, vertical, by, adjusting, the, thickness, of, the, wave, plate, one, can, control, how, much, the, horizontal, component, is, delayed, relative, to, vertical, component, before, the, light, leaves, the, wave, plate, and, they, begin, again, to, travel, at, the, same, speed, when, the, light, leaves, the, quarter, wave, plate, the, rightward, horizontal, component, will, be, exactly, one, quarter, of, a, wavelength, behind, the, vertical, component, making, the, light, left, hand, circularly, polarized, when, viewed, from, the, receiver, at, the, top, of, the, illustration, toward, the, right, is, the, circularly, polarized, light, after, it, leaves, the, wave, plate, directly, below, it, for, comparison, purposes, is, the, linearly, polarized, light, that, entered, the, quarter, wave, plate, in, the, upper, image, because, this, is, a, plane, wave, each, vector, leading, from, the, axis, to, the, helix, represents, the, magnitude, and, direction, of, the, electric, field, for, an, entire, plane, that, is, perpendicular, to, the, direction, of, travel, all, the, electric, field, vectors, have, the, same, magnitude, indicating, that, the, strength, of, the, electric, field, does, not, change, the, direction, of, the, electric, field, however, steadily, rotates, the, blue, and, green, lines, are, projections, of, the, helix, onto, the, vertical, and, horizontal, planes, respectively, and, represent, how, the, electric, field, changes, in, the, direction, of, those, two, planes, notice, how, the, rightward, horizontal, component, is, now, one, quarter, of, a, wavelength, behind, the, vertical, component, it, is, this, quarter, of, a, wavelength, phase, shift, that, results, in, the, rotational, nature, of, the, electric, field, when, the, magnitude, of, one, component, is, at, a, maximum, the, magnitude, of, the, other, component, is, always, zero, this, is, the, reason, that, there, are, helix, vectors, which, exactly, correspond, to, the, maxima, of, the, two, components, in, the, instance, just, cited, using, the, handedness, convention, used, in, many, optics, textbooks, the, light, is, considered, left, handed, counter, clockwise, circularly, polarized, referring, to, the, accompanying, animation, it, is, considered, left, handed, because, if, one, points, one, s, left, thumb, against, the, direction, of, travel, ones, fingers, curl, in, the, direction, the, electric, field, rotates, as, the, wave, passes, a, given, point, in, space, the, helix, also, forms, a, left, handed, helix, in, space, similarly, this, light, is, considered, counter, clockwise, circularly, polarized, because, if, a, stationary, observer, faces, against, the, direction, of, travel, the, person, will, observe, its, electric, field, rotate, in, the, counter, clockwise, direction, as, the, wave, passes, a, given, point, in, space, to, create, right, handed, clockwise, circularly, polarized, light, one, simply, rotates, the, axis, of, the, quarter, wave, plate, 90, relative, to, the, linear, polarizer, this, reverses, the, fast, and, slow, axes, of, the, wave, plate, relative, to, the, transmission, axis, of, the, linear, polarizer, reversing, which, component, leads, and, which, component, lags, in, trying, to, appreciate, how, the, quarter, wave, plate, transforms, the, linearly, polarized, light, it, is, important, to, realize, that, the, two, components, discussed, are, not, entities, in, and, of, themselves, but, are, merely, mental, constructs, one, uses, to, help, appreciate, what, is, happening, in, the, case, of, linearly, and, circularly, polarized, light, at, each, point, in, space, there, is, always, a, single, electric, field, with, a, distinct, vector, direction, the, quarter, wave, plate, merely, has, the, effect, of, transforming, this, single, electric, field, circular, polarizers, can, also, be, used, to, selectively, absorb, or, pass, right, handed, or, left, handed, circularly, polarized, light, it, is, this, feature, which, is, utilized, by, the, 3d, glasses, in, stereoscopic, cinemas, such, as, reald, cinema, a, given, polarizer, which, creates, one, of, the, two, polarizations, of, light, will, pass, that, same, polarization, of, light, when, that, light, is, sent, through, it, in, the, other, direction, in, contrast, it, will, block, light, of, the, opposite, polarization, the, illustration, above, is, identical, to, the, previous, similar, one, with, the, exception, that, the, left, handed, circularly, polarized, light, is, now, approaching, the, polarizer, from, the, opposite, direction, and, linearly, polarized, light, is, exiting, the, polarizer, toward, the, right, first, note, that, a, quarter, wave, plate, always, transforms, circularly, polarized, light, into, linearly, polarized, light, it, is, only, the, resulting, angle, of, polarization, of, the, linearly, polarized, light, that, is, determined, by, the, orientation, of, the, fast, and, slow, axes, of, the, quarter, wave, plate, and, the, handedness, of, the, circularly, polarized, light, in, the, illustration, the, left, handed, circularly, polarized, light, entering, the, polarizer, is, transformed, into, linearly, polarized, light, which, has, its, direction, of, polarization, along, the, transmission, axis, of, the, linear, polarizer, and, it, therefore, passes, in, contrast, right, handed, circularly, polarized, light, would, have, been, transformed, into, linearly, polarized, light, that, had, its, direction, of, polarization, along, the, absorbing, axis, of, the, linear, polarizer, which, is, at, right, angles, to, the, transmission, axis, and, it, would, have, therefore, been, blocked, to, understand, this, process, refer, to, the, illustration, on, the, right, it, is, absolutely, identical, to, the, earlier, illustration, even, though, the, circularly, polarized, light, at, the, top, is, now, considered, to, be, approaching, the, polarizer, from, the, left, one, can, observe, from, the, illustration, that, the, leftward, horizontal, as, observed, looking, along, the, direction, of, travel, component, is, leading, the, vertical, component, and, that, when, the, horizontal, component, is, retarded, by, one, quarter, of, a, wavelength, it, will, be, transformed, into, the, linearly, polarized, light, illustrated, at, the, bottom, and, it, will, pass, through, the, linear, polarizer, there, is, a, relatively, straightforward, way, to, appreciate, why, a, polarizer, which, creates, a, given, handedness, of, circularly, polarized, light, also, passes, that, same, handedness, of, polarized, light, first, given, the, dual, usefulness, of, this, image, begin, by, imagining, the, circularly, polarized, light, displayed, at, the, top, as, still, leaving, the, quarter, wave, plate, and, traveling, toward, the, left, observe, that, had, the, horizontal, component, of, the, linearly, polarized, light, been, retarded, by, a, quarter, of, wavelength, twice, which, would, amount, to, a, full, half, wavelength, the, result, would, have, been, linearly, polarized, light, that, was, at, a, right, angle, to, the, light, that, entered, if, such, orthogonally, polarized, light, were, rotated, on, the, horizontal, plane, and, directed, back, through, the, linear, polarizer, section, of, the, circular, polarizer, it, would, clearly, pass, through, given, its, orientation, now, imagine, the, circularly, polarized, light, which, has, already, passed, through, the, quarter, wave, plate, once, turned, around, and, directed, back, toward, the, circular, polarizer, again, let, the, circularly, polarized, light, illustrated, at, the, top, now, represent, that, light, such, light, is, going, to, travel, through, the, quarter, wave, plate, a, second, time, before, reaching, the, linear, polarizer, and, in, the, process, its, horizontal, component, is, going, to, be, retarded, a, second, time, by, one, quarter, of, a, wavelength, whether, that, horizontal, component, is, retarded, by, one, quarter, of, a, wavelength, in, two, distinct, steps, or, retarded, a, full, half, wavelength, all, at, once, the, orientation, of, the, resulting, linearly, polarized, light, will, be, such, that, it, passes, through, the, linear, polarizer, had, it, been, right, handed, clockwise, circularly, polarized, light, approaching, the, circular, polarizer, from, the, left, its, horizontal, component, would, have, also, been, retarded, however, the, resulting, linearly, polarized, light, would, have, been, polarized, along, the, absorbing, axis, of, the, linear, polarizer, and, it, would, not, have, passed, to, create, a, circular, polarizer, that, instead, passes, right, handed, polarized, light, and, absorbs, left, handed, light, one, again, rotates, the, wave, plate, and, linear, polarizer, 90, relative, to, each, another, it, is, easy, to, appreciate, that, by, reversing, the, positions, of, the, transmitting, and, absorbing, axes, of, the, linear, polarizer, relative, to, the, quarter, wave, plate, one, changes, which, handedness, of, polarized, light, gets, transmitted, and, which, gets, absorbed, a, homogeneous, circular, polarizer, passes, one, handedness, of, circular, polarization, unaltered, and, blocks, the, other, handedness, this, is, similar, to, the, way, that, a, linear, polarizer, would, fully, pass, one, angle, of, linearly, polarized, light, unaltered, but, would, fully, block, any, linearly, polarized, light, that, was, orthogonal, to, it, a, homogeneous, circular, polarizer, can, be, created, by, sandwiching, a, linear, polarizer, between, two, quarter, wave, plates, specifically, we, take, the, circular, polarizer, described, previously, which, transforms, circularly, polarized, light, into, linear, polarized, light, and, add, to, it, a, second, quarter, wave, plate, rotated, 90, relative, to, the, first, one, generally, speaking, and, not, making, direct, reference, to, the, above, illustration, when, either, of, the, two, polarizations, of, circularly, polarized, light, enters, the, first, quarter, wave, plate, one, of, a, pair, of, orthogonal, components, is, retarded, by, one, quarter, of, a, wavelength, relative, to, the, other, this, creates, one, of, two, linear, polarizations, depending, on, the, handedness, the, circularly, polarized, light, the, linear, polarizer, sandwiched, between, the, quarter, wave, plates, is, oriented, so, that, it, will, pass, one, linear, polarization, and, block, the, other, the, second, quarter, wave, plate, then, takes, the, linearly, polarized, light, that, passes, and, retards, the, orthogonal, component, that, was, not, retarded, by, the, previous, quarter, wave, plate, this, brings, the, two, components, back, into, their, initial, phase, relationship, reestablishing, the, selected, circular, polarization, note, that, it, does, not, matter, in, which, direction, one, passes, the, circularly, polarized, light, linear, polarizing, filters, were, the, first, types, to, be, used, in, photography, and, can, still, be, used, for, non, reflex, and, older, single, lens, reflex, cameras, slrs, however, cameras, with, through, the, lens, metering, ttl, and, autofocusing, systems, that, is, all, modern, slr, and, dslr, rely, on, optical, elements, that, pass, linearly, polarized, light, if, light, entering, the, camera, is, already, linearly, polarized, it, can, upset, the, exposure, or, autofocus, systems, circular, polarizing, filters, cut, out, linearly, polarized, light, and, so, can, be, used, to, darken, skies, improve, saturation, and, remove, reflections, but, the, circular, polarized, light, it, passes, does, not, impair, through, the, lens, systems
