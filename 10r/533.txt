a, firearm, is, any, type, of, gun, that, uses, an, explosive, charge, and, is, designed, to, be, readily, carried, and, operated, by, an, individual, the, term, is, legally, defined, further, in, different, countries, see, legal, definitions, the, first, firearms, originated, in, 10th, century, china, when, bamboo, tubes, containing, gunpowder, and, pellet, projectiles, were, mounted, on, spears, to, make, the, portable, fire, lance, operable, by, a, single, person, which, was, later, used, effectively, as, a, shock, weapon, in, the, siege, of, de, an, in, 1132, in, the, 13th, century, fire, lance, barrels, were, replaced, with, metal, tubes, and, transformed, into, the, metal, barreled, hand, cannon, the, technology, gradually, spread, throughout, eurasia, during, the, 14th, century, older, firearms, typically, used, black, powder, as, a, propellant, but, modern, firearms, use, smokeless, powder, or, other, explosive, propellants, most, modern, firearms, with, the, notable, exception, of, smoothbore, shotguns, have, rifled, barrels, to, impart, spin, to, the, projectile, for, improved, flight, stability, modern, firearms, can, be, described, by, their, caliber, i, e, bore, diameter, for, pistols, and, rifles, this, is, given, in, millimeters, or, inches, e, g, 7, 62mm, or, 308, in, in, the, case, of, shotguns, gauge, e, g, 12, ga, and, 20, ga, they, are, also, described, by, the, type, of, action, employed, e, g, muzzleloader, breechloader, lever, bolt, pump, revolver, semi, automatic, fully, automatic, etc, together, with, the, usual, means, of, deportment, i, e, hand, held, or, mechanical, mounting, further, classification, may, make, reference, to, the, type, of, barrel, used, i, e, rifled, and, to, the, barrel, length, e, g, 24, inches,

a, particular, variation, e, g, gatling, gun, shooters, aim, firearms, at, their, targets, with, hand, eye, coordination, using, either, iron, sights, or, optical, sights, the, accurate, range, of, pistols, generally, does, not, exceed, 100, metres, 110, yd, 330, ft, while, most, rifles, are, accurate, to, 500, metres, 550, yd, 1, 600, ft, using, iron, sights, or, to, longer, ranges, whilst, using, optical, sights, purpose, built, sniper, rifles, and, anti, materiel, rifles, are, accurate, to, ranges, of, more, than, 2, 000, metres, 2, 200, yd, firearm, rounds, may, be, dangerous, or, lethal, well, beyond, their, accurate, range, the, minimum, distance, for, safety, is, much, greater, than, the, specified, range, for, accuracy, a, firearm, is, a, barreled, ranged, weapon, that, inflicts, damage, on, targets, by, launching, one, or, more, projectiles, driven, by, rapidly, expanding, high, pressure, gas, produced, by, exothermic, combustion, deflagration, of, a, chemical, propellant, historically, black, powder, now, smokeless, powder, in, the, military, firearms, are, categorized, into, heavy, and, light, weapons, regarding, their, portability, by, infantry, light, firearms, are, those, that, can, be, readily, carried, by, individual, foot, soldier, though, they, might, still, require, more, than, one, individual, crew, served, to, achieve, optimal, operational, capacity, heavy, firearms, are, those, that, are, too, large, and, heavy, to, be, transported, on, foot, or, too, unstable, against, recoil, and, thus, require, the, support, of, a, weapons, platform, e, g, a, fixed, mount, wheeled, carriage, vehicle, aircraft, or, water, vessel, to, be, tactically, mobile, or, useful, the, subset, of, light, firearms, that, only, use, kinetic, projectiles, and, are, compact, enough, to, be, operated, to, full, capacity, by, a, single, infantryman, individual, served, are, also, referred, to, as, small, arms, such, firearms, include, handguns, such, as, pistols, revolvers, and, derringers, and, long, guns, such, as, rifles, and, their, subtypes, shotguns, submachine, guns, and, machine, guns, among, the, world, s, arms, manufacturers, the, top, firearms, manufacturers, are, browning, remington, colt, ruger, smith, wesson, savage, mossberg, united, states, heckler, koch, sig, sauer, walther, germany, zub, czech, republic, glock, steyr, arms,

single, hand, they, are, the, smallest, of, all, firearms, and, are, common, as, sidearms, concealed, carry, weapons, or, as, backup, weapons, for, self, defense, handguns, can, be, categorized, into, two, broad, types, pistols, which, have, a, single, fixed, firing, chamber, machined, into, the, rear, of, the, barrel, and, are, often, loaded, using, magazines, of, varying, capacities, revolvers, which, have, a, number, of, firing, chambers, or, charge, holes, in, a, revolving, cylinder, each, one, loaded, with, a, single, cartridge, or, charge, and, derringers, broadly, defined, as, any, handgun, that, is, not, a, traditional, pistol, nor, a, revolver, there, are, various, types, of, the, aforementioned, handguns, designed, for, different, mechanisms, or, purposes, such, as, single, shot, manual, repeating, semi, automatic, or, automatic, pistols, single, action, double, action, or, double, action, single, action, revolvers, and, small, compact, handguns, for, concealed, carry, such, as, pocket, pistols, and, saturday, night, specials, examples, of, pistols, include, the, glock, browning, hi, power, m1911, pistol, makarov, pistol, walther, pp, luger, pistol, mauser, c96, and, beretta, 92, examples, of, revolvers, include, the, colt, single, action, army, smith, wesson, model, 10, colt, official, police, colt, python, new, nambu, m60, and, mateba, autorevolver, examples, of, derringers, include, the, remington, model, 95, fp, 45, liberator, and, cop, 357, derringer, a, long, gun, is, any, firearm, with, a, notably, long, barrel, typically, a, length, of, 10, to, 30, inches, 250, to, 760, mm, there, are, restrictions, on, minimum, barrel, length, in, many, jurisdictions, maximum, barrel, length, is, usually, a, matter, of, practicality, unlike, a, handgun, long, guns, are, designed, to, be, held, and, fired, with, both, hands, while, braced, against, either, the, hip, or, the, shoulder, for, better, stability, the, receiver, and, trigger, group, is, mounted, into, a, stock, made, of, wood, plastic, metal, or, composite, material, which, has, sections, that, form, a, foregrip, rear, grip, and, optionally, but, typically, a, shoulder, mount, called, the, butt, early, long, arms, from, the, renaissance, up, to, the, mid, 19th, century, were, generally, smoothbore, firearms, that, fired, one, or, more, ball, shot, called, muskets, or, arquebus, depending, on, caliber, and, firing, mechanism, since, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, various, types, of, long, guns, have, been, created, for, different, purposes, a, rifle, is, a, long, gun, that, has, riflings, spiral, grooves, machined, into, the, bore, inner, surface, of, its, barrel, imparting, a, gyroscopically, stabilizing, spin, to, the, bullets, that, it, fires, a, descendant, of, the, musket, rifles, produce, a, single, point, of, impact, with, each, firing, with, a, long, range, and, high, accuracy, for, this, reason, as, well, as, for, their, ubiquity, rifles, are, very, popular, among, militaries, as, service, rifles, police, as, accurate, long, range, alternatives, to, their, traditional, shotgun, long, guns, and, civilians, for, hunting, shooting, sports, and, self, defense, many, types, of, rifles, exist, owing, to, their, wide, adoption, and, versatility, ranging, from, mere, barrel, length, differences, as, in, short, barreled, rifles, and, carbines, to, classifications, per, the, rifle, s, function, and, purpose, as, in, semi, automatic, rifles, automatic, rifles, and, sniper, rifles, to, differences, in, the, rifle, s, action, as, in, bolt, action, lever, action, and, break, action, rifles, examples, of, rifles, of, various, types, include, the, henry, rifle, winchester, rifle, lee, enfield, gewehr, 98, m1, garand, mas, 36, rifle, akm, ruger, 10, 22, heckler, koch, g3, remington, model, 700, and, heckler, koch, hk417, a, shotgun, is, a, long, gun, that, has, a, predominantly, smoothbore, barrel, meaning, it, lacks, rifling, designed, to, fire, a, number, of, shot, pellets, in, each, discharge, these, shot, pellet, sizes, commonly, range, between, 2, mm, 9, birdshot, and, 8, 4, mm, 00, double, aught, buckshot, and, produce, a, cluster, of, impact, points, with, considerably, less, range, and, accuracy, since, shot, spreads, during, flight, shotguns, are, also, capable, of, firing, single, solid, projectiles, called, slugs, or, specialty, often, less, lethal, munitions, such, as, bean, bags, or, tear, gas, to, function, as, a, riot, gun, or, breaching, rounds, to, function, as, a, door, breaching, shotgun, shotgun, munitions, regardless, of, type, are, packed, into, shotgun, shells, cartridges, designed, specifically, for, shotguns, that, are, loaded, into, the, shotgun, for, use, these, shells, are, commonly, loose, and, manually, loaded, one, by, one, though, some, shotguns, accept, magazines, shotguns, share, many, qualities, with, rifles, such, as, both, being, descendants, of, early, long, guns, such, as, the, musket, both, having, bolt, action, lever, action, break, action, pump, action, semi, automatic, and, automatic, variants, and, both, being, popular, with, militaries, police, and, civilians, for, largely, the, same, reasons, however, unlike, rifles, shotguns, are, less, favored, in, combat, roles, due, to, their, low, accuracy, and, limited, effectiveness, in, modern, warfare, with, combat, shotguns, often, only, used, for, breaching, or, close, quarters, combat, and, sometimes, limited, to, underbarrel, attachments, such, as, the, m26, modular, accessory, shotgun, system, shotguns, are, still, popular, with, civilians, for, the, suitability, of, their, shot, spread, in, hunting, clay, pigeon, shooting, and, home, defense, double, barreled, shotguns, are, break, action, shotguns, with, two, parallel, barrels, horizontal, side, by, side, or, vertical, over, under, allowing, two, single, shots, that, can, be, loaded, and, fired, in, quick, succession, examples, of, shotguns, include, the, winchester, model, 1897, browning, auto, 5, ithaca, 37, remington, model, 870, mossberg, 500, benelli, m4, franchi, spas, 12, atchisson, aa, 12, and, knight, s, armament, company, masterkey, a, carbine, is, a, long, gun, usually, a, rifle, that, has, had, its, barrel, shortened, from, its, original, length, or, is, of, a, certain, size, smaller, than, standard, rifles, but, is, still, large, enough, to, be, considered, a, long, gun, how, considerable, the, difference, is, between, a, rifle, and, a, carbine, varies, for, example, the, standard, heckler, koch, g36, s, barrel, has, a, length, of, 480, mm, 18, 9, in, the, g36k, carbine, variant, s, barrel, is, 318, mm, 12, 5, in, and, the, g36c, compact, variant, s, barrel, is, 228, mm, 9, 0, in, some, carbines, are, also, redesigned, compared, to, their, rifle, counterparts, such, as, the, aforementioned, g36, g36k, and, g36c, or, the, ak, 74, and, aks, 74u, however, some, carbines, such, as, the, m1, carbine, are, not, a, variant, of, any, existing, design, and, are, their, own, firearm, model, carbines, are, regardless, very, similar, to, rifles, and, often, have, the, same, actions, single, shot, lever, action, bolt, action, semi, automatic, automatic, etc, this, similarity, has, given, carbines, the, alternate, name, of, short, barreled, rifle, sbr, though, this, more, accurately, describes, a, full, size, rifle, with, a, shortened, carbine, style, barrel, for, close, quarters, use, the, small, size, of, a, carbine, provides, lower, weight, and, better, maneuverability, making, them, ideal, for, close, quarters, combat, and, storage, in, compact, areas, this, makes, them, popular, firearms, among, special, forces, and, police, tactical, units, alongside, submachine, guns, considerably, so, since, the, late, 1990s, due, to, the, familiarity, and, better, stopping, power, of, carbines, compared, to, submachine, guns, they, are, also, popular, with, and, were, originally, mostly, intended, for, military, personnel, in, roles, that, are, expected, to, engage, in, combat, but, where, a, full, size, rifle, would, be, an, impediment, to, the, primary, duties, of, that, soldier, logistical, personnel, airborne, forces, military, engineers, officers, etc, though, since, the, turn, of, the, millennium, these, have, been, superseded, to, a, degree, in, some, roles, by, personal, defense, weapons, carbines, are, also, common, among, civilian, firearm, owners, who, have, size, space, and, power, concerns, similar, to, military, and, police, users, examples, of, carbines, include, the, winchester, model, 1892, rifle, no, 5, mk, i, sks, m1, carbine, ruger, mini, 14, m4, carbine, and, kel, tec, sub, 2000, an, assault, rifle, is, commonly, defined, as, a, selective, fire, rifle, chambered, in, an, intermediate, cartridge, such, as, 5, 56, 45mm, nato, 7, 62, 39mm, 5, 45, 39mm, and, 300, aac, blackout, and, fed, with, a, detachable, magazine, assault, rifles, are, also, usually, smaller, than, full, sized, rifles, such, as, battle, rifles, originating, with, the, stg, 44, produced, by, nazi, germany, during, world, war, ii, assault, rifles, have, since, become, extremely, popular, among, militaries, and, other, armed, groups, due, to, their, universal, versatility, and, they, have, made, up, the, vast, majority, of, standard, issue, military, service, rifles, since, the, mid, 20th, century, various, configurations, of, assault, rifle, exist, such, as, the, bullpup, in, which, the, firing, grip, is, located, in, front, of, the, breech, instead, of, behind, it, examples, of, assault, rifles, include, the, kalashnikov, rifles, of, soviet, and, russian, origin, such, as, the, ak, 47, akm, and, ak, 74, as, well, as, the, american, m4, carbine, and, m16, rifle, a, battle, rifle, is, commonly, defined, as, a, semi, automatic, or, selective, fire, rifle, that, is, larger, or, longer, than, an, assault, rifle, and, is, chambered, in, a, full, power, cartridge, e, g, 7, 62, 51mm, nato, 7, 92, 57mm, mauser, 7, 62, 54mmr, the, term, originated, as, a, retronym, to, differentiate, older, full, powered, rifles, of, these, configurations, like, the, m1, garand, from, newer, assault, rifles, using, intermediate, cartridges, like, the, heckler, koch, hk33, but, it, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, similar, modern, rifles, such, as, the, fn, scar, battle, rifles, serve, similar, purposes, as, assault, rifles, as, they, both, are, usually, employed, by, ground, infantry, for, essentially, the, same, purposes, however, some, prefer, battle, rifles, for, their, more, powerful, cartridge, despite, the, added, recoil, some, designated, marksman, rifles, are, configured, from, battle, rifles, such, as, the, mk, 14, enhanced, battle, rifle, and, united, states, marine, corps, designated, marksman, rifle, both, essentially, heavily, modified, and, modernized, variants, of, the, m14, rifle, examples, of, rifles, considered, to, be, battle, rifles, include, the, fg, 42, gewehr, 43, fn, fal, howa, type, 64, and, desert, tech, mdr, a, sniper, rifle, is, per, widespread, definition, a, high, powered, precision, rifle, often, bolt, action, or, semi, automatic, with, an, effective, range, farther, than, that, of, a, standard, rifle, though, any, rifle, in, a, sniper, configuration, usually, with, a, telescopic, sight, and, bipod, can, be, considered, a, sniper, rifle, most, sniper, rifles, are, purpose, built, for, their, applications, or, are, variants, of, existing, rifles, that, have, been, modified, to, function, as, sniper, rifles, such, as, the, type, 97, sniper, rifle, which, was, essentially, a, standard, type, 38, rifle, that, was, modified, to, be, lighter, and, come, with, a, telescopic, sight, related, developments, are, anti, materiel, rifles, high, caliber, rifles, designed, to, destroy, enemy, materiel, such, as, vehicles, supplies, or, hardware, anti, tank, rifles, anti, materiel, rifles, that, were, designed, specifically, to, combat, early, armoured, fighting, vehicles, but, are, now, largely, obsolete, due, to, advances, in, vehicle, armour, scout, rifles, a, broad, class, of, rifles, generally, summed, up, as, short, lightweight, portable, sniper, rifles, and, designated, marksman, rifles, semi, automatic, high, precision, rifles, usually, chambered, in, intermediate, or, full, power, cartridges, that, fill, the, range, gap, between, sniper, rifles, and, regular, rifles, and, are, designed, for, designated, marksmen, in, squads, examples, of, sniper, and, scout, rifles, include, the, m40, rifle, heckler, koch, psg1, walther, wa, 2000, accuracy, international, awm, m24, sniper, weapon, system, steyr, scout, sako, trg, and, cheytac, intervention, examples, of, anti, materiel, and, anti, tank, rifles, include, the, mauser, tankgewehr, m1918, boys, anti, tank, rifle, ptrs, 41, barrett, m82, gep, rd, anti, materiel, rifle, and, mcmillan, tac, 50, examples, of, designated, marksman, rifles, include, the, svd, sr, 25, dragunov, svu, marine, scout, sniper, rifle, mk, 14, enhanced, battle, rifle, and, m110, semi, automatic, sniper, system, an, automatic, rifle, is, a, magazine, fed, rifle, that, is, capable, of, automatic, fire, they, include, most, assault, rifles, and, battle, rifles, but, originated, as, their, own, category, of, rifles, capable, of, automatic, fire, as, opposed, to, the, bolt, action, and, semi, automatic, rifles, commonly, issued, to, infantry, at, the, time, of, their, invention, they, usually, have, smaller, magazine, capacities, than, machine, guns, the, french, chauchat, had, a, 20, round, box, magazine, while, the, hotchkiss, mle, 1914, machine, gun, the, french, army, s, standard, machine, gun, at, the, time, was, fed, by, a, 250, round, ammunition, belt, though, automatic, rifles, are, sometimes, considered, to, be, their, own, category, they, are, also, occasionally, considered, to, be, other, types, of, firearms, that, postdated, their, invention, usually, as, light, machine, guns, automatic, rifles, are, sometimes, confused, with, machine, guns, or, vice, versa, or, are, defined, as, such, by, law, the, national, firearms, act, and, firearm, owners, protection, act, define, a, machine, gun, in, united, states, code, title, 26, subtitle, e, chapter, 53, subchapter, b, part, 1, 5845, as, any, firearm, which, shoots, automatically, more, than, one, shot, without, manual, reloading, by, a, single, function, of, the, trigger, machine, gun, is, therefore, largely, synonymous, with, automatic, weapon, in, american, civilian, parlance, covering, all, automatic, firearms, in, most, jurisdictions, automatic, rifles, as, well, as, automatic, firearms, in, general, are, prohibited, from, civilian, purchase, or, are, at, least, heavily, restricted, in, the, u, s, for, instance, most, automatic, rifles, are, title, ii, weapons, that, require, certain, licenses, and, are, greatly, regulated, examples, of, automatic, rifles, include, the, cei, rigotti, lewis, gun, fedorov, avtomat, and, m1918, browning, automatic, rifle, a, machine, gun, is, a, fully, automatic, firearm, chambered, in, intermediate, or, full, power, rifle, cartridges, designed, to, provide, sustained, automatic, direct, fire, as, opposed, to, the, semi, automatic, or, burst, fire, of, standard, rifles, they, are, commonly, associated, with, being, belt, fed, though, many, machine, guns, are, also, fed, by, box, drum, pan, or, hopper, magazines, they, generally, have, a, high, rate, of, fire, and, a, large, ammunition, capacity, and, are, often, used, for, suppressive, fire, to, support, infantry, advances, or, defend, positions, from, enemy, assaults, owing, to, their, versatility, and, firepower, they, are, also, commonly, installed, on, military, vehicles, and, military, aircraft, either, as, main, or, ancillary, weapons, many, machine, guns, are, individual, served, and, can, be, operated, by, a, single, soldier, though, some, are, crew, served, weapons, that, require, a, dedicated, crew, of, soldiers, to, operate, usually, between, two, and, six, soldiers, depending, on, the, machine, gun, s, operation, and, the, crew, members, roles, ammunition, bearers, spotters, etc, machine, guns, can, be, divided, into, three, categories, light, machine, guns, individual, served, machine, guns, of, an, intermediate, cartridge, that, are, usually, magazine, fed, medium, machine, guns, belt, fed, machine, guns, of, a, full, power, caliber, and, a, certain, weight, that, can, be, operated, by, an, individual, but, tend, to, work, best, with, a, crew, and, heavy, machine, guns, machine, guns, that, are, too, large, and, heavy, to, be, carried, and, are, thus, mounted, to, something, like, a, tripod, or, military, vehicle, and, require, a, crew, to, operate, a, general, purpose, machine, gun, combines, these, categories, under, a, single, flexible, machine, gun, platform, often, one, that, is, most, suitable, as, a, light, or, medium, machine, gun, but, fares, well, as, a, heavy, machine, gun, a, closely, related, concept, is, the, squad, automatic, weapon, a, portable, light, machine, gun, or, even, a, modified, rifle, that, is, designed, and, fielded, to, provide, a, squad, with, rapid, direct, fire, examples, of, machine, guns, include, the, maxim, gun, m2, browning, bren, light, machine, gun, mg, 42, pk, machine, gun, fn, mag, m249, light, machine, gun, rpk, iwi, negev, and, m134, minigun, a, submachine, gun, is, a, magazine, fed, carbine, chambered, in, a, small, caliber, handgun, cartridge, such, as, 9, 19mm, parabellum, 45, acp, 22, long, rifle, and, 40, s, w, they, cannot, be, considered, machine, guns, due, to, their, small, caliber, hence, the, prefix, sub, to, differentiate, them, from, proper, machine, guns, submachine, guns, are, commonly, associated, with, high, rates, of, fire, automatic, fire, capabilities, and, low, recoil, though, many, submachine, guns, differentiate, from, this, in, various, ways, such, as, having, fairly, low, rates, of, fire, or, including, burst, and, semi, automatic, modes, available, through, selective, fire, most, submachine, guns, are, the, size, of, carbines, and, short, barreled, rifles, and, use, similar, configurations, many, are, designed, to, take, as, little, space, as, possible, for, use, in, close, quarters, or, for, easy, storage, in, vehicles, and, cases, some, submachine, guns, are, designed, and, configured, similar, to, pistols, even, down, to, size, and, are, thus, occasionally, classed, as, machine, pistols, even, if, they, are, not, actually, a, handgun, i, e, designed, to, require, two, hands, to, use, submachine, guns, are, considered, ideal, for, close, quarters, combat, and, are, cheap, to, mass, produce, they, were, very, common, in, military, service, through, much, of, the, 20th, century, but, have, since, been, superseded, in, most, combat, roles, by, rifles, carbines, and, personal, defense, weapons, due, to, their, low, effective, range, and, poor, penetration, against, most, body, armor, developed, since, the, late, 20th, century, however, they, remain, popular, among, special, forces, and, police, for, their, effectiveness, in, close, quarters, and, low, likelihood, to, overpenetrate, targets, examples, of, submachine, guns, include, the, mp, 18, mp, 40, thompson, submachine, gun, m3, submachine, gun, uzi, heckler, koch, mp5, spectre, m4, steyr, tmp, heckler, koch, ump, pp, 2000, kriss, vector, and, sig, mpx, a, personal, defense, weapon, is, in, simplest, terms, a, submachine, gun, that, is, designed, to, fire, ammunition, with, ballistic, performance, that, is, similar, to, but, not, actually, a, type, of, rifle, cartridges, often, called, sub, intermediate, cartridges, in, this, way, it, combines, the, high, automatic, rate, of, fire, reliable, low, recoil, and, lightweight, compact, maneuverability, of, submachine, guns, with, the, versatility, penetration, and, effective, range, of, rifles, effectively, making, them, an, in, between, of, submachine, guns, and, carbines, personal, defense, weapons, were, developed, to, provide, rear, and, second, line, personnel, not, otherwise, armed, with, high, caliber, firearms, vehicle, and, weapon, crews, engineers, logistical, personnel, etc, with, a, method, of, effective, self, defense, against, skirmishers, and, infiltrators, who, cannot, effectively, be, defeated, by, low, powered, submachine, guns, and, handguns, often, the, only, firearms, suitable, for, those, personnel, while, they, could, be, issued, rifles, or, carbines, those, would, become, unnecessary, burdens, in, their, normal, duties, during, which, the, likelihood, of, hostility, is, fairly, rare, regardless, making, their, issuance, questionable, thus, per, their, name, personal, defense, weapons, allow, these, personnel, to, effectively, defend, themselves, from, enemies, and, repel, attacks, themselves, or, at, least, until, support, can, arrive, they, are, not, intended, for, civilian, self, defense, due, to, their, nature, as, automatic, firearms, which, are, usually, prohibited, from, civilian, purchase, though, some, semi, automatic, pdws, exist, for, the, civilian, market, albeit, often, with, longer, barrels, examples, of, personal, defense, weapons, include, the, fn, p90, heckler, koch, mp7, aac, honey, badger, and, st, kinetics, cpw, types, aside, firearms, are, also, categorized, by, their, action, which, describes, their, loading, firing, and, unloading, cycle, manual, action, or, manual, operation, is, essentially, any, type, of, firearm, action, that, is, loaded, and, usually, also, fired, one, cartridge, at, a, time, by, the, user, rather, than, automatically, manual, action, firearms, can, be, divided, into, two, basic, categories, single, shot, firearms, that, can, only, be, fired, once, per, barrel, before, it, must, be, reloaded, or, charged, via, an, external, mechanism, or, series, of, steps, and, repeating, firearms, that, can, be, fired, multiple, times, per, barrel, but, can, only, be, fired, once, with, each, subsequent, pull, of, the, trigger, or, ignite, and, the, firearm, s, action, must, be, reloaded, or, charged, via, an, internal, mechanism, between, trigger, pulls, types, of, manual, actions, include, lever, action, bolt, action, and, pump, action, lever, action, is, a, repeating, action, that, is, operated, by, using, a, cocking, handle, the, lever, located, around, the, trigger, guard, area, often, incorporating, it, that, is, pulled, down, then, back, up, to, move, the, bolt, via, internal, linkages, and, cock, the, firing, pin, mechanism, expelling, the, old, cartridge, and, loading, a, new, one, bolt, action, is, a, repeating, and, rarely, single, shot, action, that, is, operated, by, directly, manipulating, the, bolt, via, a, bolt, handle, the, bolt, is, unlocked, from, the, receiver, then, pulled, back, to, open, the, breech, ejecting, a, cartridge, and, cocking, the, striker, and, engaging, it, against, the, sear, when, the, bolt, is, returned, to, the, forward, position, a, new, cartridge, if, loaded, is, pushed, out, of, the, magazine, and, into, the, barrel, chamber, and, the, breech, is, re, locked, two, designs, of, bolt, action, exist, rotating, bolt, where, the, bolt, must, be, axially, rotated, to, unlock, and, lock, the, receiver, and, straight, pull, which, does, not, require, the, bolt, to, be, rotated, simplifying, the, bolt, action, mechanism, and, allowing, for, a, greater, rate, of, fire, pump, action, or, slide, action, is, a, repeating, action, that, is, operated, by, moving, a, sliding, handguard, the, pump, on, the, gun, s, forestock, rearward, frontward, on, some, models, ejecting, any, spent, cartridges, and, cocking, the, hammer, or, striker, then, moving, the, handguard, forward, to, load, a, new, cartridge, into, the, chamber, it, is, most, common, on, shotguns, though, pump, action, rifles, and, grenade, launchers, also, exist, semi, automatic, self, loading, or, autoloading, is, a, firearm, action, that, after, a, single, discharge, automatically, performs, the, feeding, and, ignition, procedures, necessary, to, prepare, the, firearm, for, a, subsequent, discharge, semi, automatic, firearms, only, discharge, once, with, each, trigger, actuation, and, the, trigger, must, be, actuated, again, to, fire, another, cartridge, types, of, semi, automatic, actions, and, modes, include, automatic, burst, and, selective, automatic, is, a, firearm, action, that, uses, the, same, automated, action, cycling, as, semi, automatic, but, continues, to, do, so, for, as, long, as, the, trigger, is, actuated, until, the, trigger, is, let, go, of, or, the, firearm, is, depleted, of, available, ammunition, the, excess, energy, released, from, a, discharged, cartridge, is, used, to, load, a, new, cartridge, into, the, chamber, then, igniting, the, propellant, and, discharging, said, new, cartridge, by, delivering, a, hammer, or, striker, impact, on, the, primer, automatic, firearms, are, further, defined, by, the, type, of, cycling, principles, used, such, as, recoil, operation, uses, energy, from, the, recoil, to, cycle, the, action, blowback, uses, energy, from, the, cartridge, case, as, it, is, pushed, by, expanding, gas, blow, forward, use, propellant, gas, pressure, to, open, the, breech, or, gas, operation, uses, high, pressure, gas, from, a, fired, cartridge, to, dispose, of, the, spent, case, and, load, a, new, cartridge, burst, is, a, fire, mode, of, some, semi, automatic, and, automatic, firearms, that, fires, a, predetermined, amount, of, rounds, usually, two, or, three, in, the, same, manner, as, automatic, fire, depending, on, the, firearm, a, single, trigger, actuation, may, fire, the, full, burst, of, rounds, or, it, must, be, depressed, for, the, entire, discharge, with, a, single, pull, of, the, trigger, firing, a, single, round, or, an, incomplete, burst, most, firearms, with, burst, capabilities, have, it, as, a, fire, mode, secondary, to, semi, automatic, and, automatic, selective, fire, or, select, fire, is, the, capability, of, a, firearm, to, have, its, fire, mode, adjusted, between, semi, automatic, burst, or, automatic, the, modes, are, chosen, by, means, of, a, fire, mode, selector, which, varies, depending, on, the, weapon, s, design, the, presence, of, selective, fire, modes, on, firearms, allows, more, efficient, use, of, ammunition, for, specific, tactical, needs, either, precision, aimed, or, suppressive, fire, selective, fire, is, most, commonly, found, on, assault, rifles, and, submachine, guns, firearms, can, be, used, as, blunt, weapons, for, instance, to, conserve, limited, ammunition, or, when, ammunition, has, run, out, entirely, new, recruits, of, the, israel, defense, forces, undergo, training, on, the, safe, practice, of, using, the, m16, rifle, as, a, blunt, weapon, mainly, so, that, in, close, quarter, fighting, the, weapon, cannot, be, pulled, away, from, them, other, training, includes, the, recruit, learning, how, to, jab, parts, of, the, body, with, the, muzzle, and, using, the, butt, stock, as, a, weapon, forensic, medicine, recognizes, evidence, for, various, types, of, blunt, force, injuries, produced, by, firearms, for, example, pistol, whipping, typically, leaves, semicircular, or, triangular, lacerations, of, skin, produced, by, the, butt, of, a, pistol, in, armed, robberies, beating, the, victims, with, firearms, is, a, more, common, way, to, complete, the, robbery, rather, than, shooting, or, stabbing, them, examples, include, the, first, firearms, were, invented, in, 10th, century, china, when, the, man, portable, fire, lance, a, bamboo, or, metal, tube, that, could, shoot, ignited, gunpowder, was, combined, with, projectiles, such, as, scrap, metal, broken, porcelain, or, darts, arrows, an, early, depiction, of, a, firearm, is, a, sculpture, from, a, cave, in, sichuan, china, the, sculpture, dates, to, the, 12th, century, and, represents, a, figure, carrying, a, vase, shaped, bombard, with, flames, and, a, cannonball, coming, out, of, it, the, oldest, surviving, gun, a, hand, cannon, made, of, bronze, has, been, dated, to, 1288, because, it, was, discovered, at, a, site, in, modern, day, acheng, district, heilongjiang, china, where, the, yuan, shi, records, that, battles, were, fought, at, that, time, the, firearm, had, a, 17, 5, cm, 6, 9, in, barrel, of, a, 2, 5, cm, 1, in, diameter, a, 6, 6, cm, 2, 6, in, chamber, for, the, gunpowder, and, a, socket, for, the, firearm, s, handle, it, is, 34, centimetres, 13, in, long, and, 3, 54, kilograms, 7, 8, lb, without, the, handle, which, would, have, been, made, of, wood, the, arabs, and, mamluks, had, firearms, in, the, late, 13th, century, europeans, obtained, firearms, in, the, 14th, century, the, koreans, adopted, firearms, from, the, chinese, in, the, 14th, century, the, iranians, first, aq, qoyunlu, and, safavids, and, indians, first, mughals, all, got, them, no, later, than, the, 15th, century, from, the, ottoman, turks, the, people, of, the, nusantara, archipelago, of, southeast, asia, used, the, long, arquebus, at, least, by, the, last, quarter, of, the, 15th, century, 23, even, though, the, knowledge, of, making, gunpowder, based, weapons, in, the, nusantara, archipelago, had, been, known, after, the, failed, mongol, invasion, of, java, 1293, and, the, predecessor, of, firearms, the, pole, gun, bedil, tombak, was, recorded, as, being, used, by, java, in, 1413, 245, the, knowledge, of, making, true, firearms, came, much, later, after, the, middle, of, 15th, century, it, was, brought, by, the, islamic, nations, of, west, asia, most, probably, the, arabs, the, precise, year, of, introduction, is, unknown, but, it, may, be, safely, concluded, to, be, no, earlier, than, 1460, 23, before, the, arrival, of, the, portuguese, in, southeast, asia, the, natives, already, possessed, firearms, the, java, arquebus, the, technology, of, firearms, in, southeast, asia, further, improved, after, the, portuguese, capture, of, malacca, 1511, starting, in, the, 1513, the, traditions, of, german, bohemian, gun, making, merged, with, turkish, gun, making, traditions, 39, 41, this, resulted, in, the, indo, portuguese, tradition, of, matchlocks, indian, craftsmen, modified, the, design, by, introducing, a, very, short, almost, pistol, like, buttstock, held, against, the, cheek, not, the, shoulder, when, aiming, they, also, reduced, the, caliber, and, made, the, gun, lighter, and, more, balanced, this, was, a, hit, with, the, portuguese, who, did, a, lot, of, fighting, aboard, ship, and, on, river, craft, and, valued, a, more, compact, gun, 41, the, malaccan, gunfounders, compared, as, being, in, the, same, level, with, those, of, germany, quickly, adapted, these, new, firearms, and, thus, a, new, type, of, arquebus, the, istinggar, appeared, 385, the, japanese, did, not, acquire, firearms, until, the, 16th, century, and, then, from, the, portuguese, rather, than, from, the, chinese, developments, in, firearms, accelerated, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, breech, loading, became, more, or, less, a, universal, standard, for, the, reloading, of, most, hand, held, firearms, and, continues, to, be, so, with, some, notable, exceptions, such, as, mortars, instead, of, loading, individual, rounds, into, weapons, magazines, holding, multiple, munitions, were, adopted, these, aided, rapid, reloading, automatic, and, semi, automatic, firing, mechanisms, meant, that, a, single, soldier, could, fire, many, more, rounds, in, a, minute, than, a, vintage, weapon, could, fire, over, the, course, of, a, battle, polymers, and, alloys, in, firearm, construction, made, weaponry, progressively, lighter, and, thus, easier, to, deploy, ammunition, changed, over, the, centuries, from, simple, metallic, ball, shaped, projectiles, that, rattled, down, the, barrel, to, bullets, and, cartridges, manufactured, to, high, precision, especially, in, the, past, century, particular, attention, has, focused, on, accuracy, and, sighting, to, make, firearms, altogether, far, more, accurate, than, ever, before, more, than, any, single, factor, though, firearms, have, proliferated, due, to, the, advent, of, mass, production, enabling, arms, manufacturers, to, produce, large, quantities, of, weaponry, to, a, consistent, standard, velocities, of, bullets, increased, with, the, use, of, a, jacket, of, metals, such, as, copper, or, copper, alloys, that, covered, a, lead, core, and, allowed, the, bullet, to, glide, down, the, barrel, more, easily, than, exposed, lead, such, bullets, are, known, as, full, metal, jacket, fmj, such, fmj, bullets, are, less, likely, to, fragment, on, impact, and, are, more, likely, to, traverse, through, a, target, while, imparting, less, energy, hence, fmj, bullets, impart, less, tissue, damage, than, non, jacketed, bullets, that, expand, this, led, to, their, adoption, for, military, use, by, countries, adhering, to, the, hague, convention, of, 1899, that, said, the, basic, principle, behind, firearm, operation, remains, unchanged, to, this, day, a, musket, of, several, centuries, ago, is, still, similar, in, principle, to, a, modern, day, rifle, using, the, expansion, of, gases, to, propel, projectiles, over, long, distances, albeit, less, accurately, and, rapidly, the, chinese, fire, lance, from, the, 10th, century, was, the, direct, predecessor, to, the, modern, concept, of, the, firearm, it, was, not, a, gun, itself, but, an, addition, to, soldiers, spears, originally, it, consisted, of, paper, or, bamboo, barrels, that, would, contain, incendiary, gunpowder, that, could, be, lit, one, time, and, which, would, project, flames, at, the, enemy, sometimes, chinese, troops, would, place, small, projectiles, within, the, barrel, that, would, also, be, projected, when, the, gunpowder, was, lit, but, most, of, the, explosive, force, would, create, flames, later, the, barrel, was, changed, to, be, made, of, metal, so, that, more, explosive, gunpowder, could, be, used, and, put, more, force, into, the, propulsion, of, projectiles, 31, 32, the, original, predecessor, of, all, firearms, the, chinese, hand, cannon, from, the, 13th, century, was, loaded, with, gunpowder, and, the, projectile, initially, lead, shot, later, replaced, by, cast, iron, through, the, muzzle, while, a, fuse, was, placed, at, the, rear, this, fuse, was, lit, causing, the, gunpowder, to, ignite, and, propel, the, projectiles, in, military, use, the, standard, hand, cannon, was, tremendously, powerful, while, also, being, somewhat, erratic, due, to, the, relative, inability, of, the, gunner, to, aim, the, weapon, or, to, control, the, ballistic, properties, of, the, projectile, recoil, could, be, absorbed, by, bracing, the, barrel, against, the, ground, using, a, wooden, support, the, forerunner, of, the, stock, neither, the, quality, nor, amount, of, gunpowder, nor, the, consistency, in, projectile, dimensions, was, controlled, with, resulting, inaccuracy, in, firing, due, to, windage, variance, in, gunpowder, composition, and, the, difference, in, diameter, between, the, bore, and, the, shot, hand, cannons, were, replaced, around, the, 15th, century, by, lighter, carriage, mounted, artillery, pieces, and, ultimately, by, the, arquebus, in, the, 1420s, gunpowder, was, used, to, propel, missiles, from, hand, held, tubes, during, the, hussite, revolt, in, bohemia, the, arquebus, is, a, long, gun, that, appeared, in, europe, and, the, ottoman, empire, during, the, 15th, century, the, term, arquebus, is, derived, from, the, dutch, word, haaqbus, literally, meaning, hook, gun, the, term, arquebus, was, applied, to, many, different, types, of, guns, in, their, earliest, form, they, were, defensive, weapon, mounts, on, german, city, walls, in, the, 15th, century, the, addition, of, a, shoulder, stock, priming, pan, and, matchlock, mechanism, in, the, late, 15th, century, turned, the, arquebus, into, a, handheld, firearm, and, also, first, firearm, equipped, with, a, trigger, heavy, arquebuses, mounted, on, war, wagons, were, called, arquebus, a, croc, these, heavy, arquebuses, fired, a, lead, ball, of, about, 3, 5, ounces, 100g, muzzle, loading, muskets, smooth, bored, long, guns, were, among, the, first, firearms, developed, the, firearm, was, loaded, through, the, muzzle, with, gunpowder, optionally, with, some, wadding, and, then, with, a, bullet, usually, a, solid, lead, ball, but, musketeers, could, shoot, stones, when, they, ran, out, of, bullets, greatly, improved, muzzleloaders, usually, rifled, instead, of, smooth, bored, are, manufactured, today, and, have, many, enthusiasts, many, of, whom, hunt, large, and, small, game, with, their, guns, muzzleloaders, have, to, be, manually, reloaded, after, each, shot, a, skilled, archer, could, fire, multiple, arrows, faster, than, most, early, muskets, could, be, reloaded, and, fired, although, by, the, mid, 18th, century, when, muzzleloaders, became, the, standard, small, armament, of, the, military, a, well, drilled, soldier, could, fire, six, rounds, in, a, minute, using, prepared, cartridges, in, his, musket, before, then, the, effectiveness, of, muzzleloaders, was, hindered, both, by, the, low, reloading, speed, and, before, the, firing, mechanism, was, perfected, by, the, very, high, risk, posed, by, the, firearm, to, the, person, attempting, to, fire, it, one, interesting, solution, to, the, reloading, problem, was, the, roman, candle, gun, with, superposed, loads, this, was, a, muzzleloader, in, which, multiple, charges, and, balls, were, loaded, one, on, top, of, the, other, with, a, small, hole, in, each, ball, to, allow, the, subsequent, charge, to, be, ignited, after, the, one, ahead, of, it, was, ignited, it, was, neither, a, very, reliable, nor, popular, firearm, but, it, enabled, a, form, of, automatic, fire, long, before, the, advent, of, the, machine, gun, matchlocks, were, the, first, and, simplest, firearms, firing, mechanisms, developed, in, the, matchlock, mechanism, the, powder, in, the, gun, barrel, was, ignited, by, a, piece, of, burning, cord, called, a, match, the, match, was, wedged, into, one, end, of, an, s, shaped, piece, of, steel, when, the, trigger, often, actually, a, lever, was, pulled, the, match, was, brought, into, the, open, end, of, a, touch, hole, at, the, base, of, the, gun, barrel, which, contained, a, very, small, quantity, of, gunpowder, igniting, the, main, charge, of, gunpowder, in, the, gun, barrel, the, match, usually, had, to, be, relit, after, each, firing, the, main, parts, of, the, matchlock, firing, mechanism, are, the, pan, match, arm, and, trigger, a, benefit, of, the, pan, and, arm, swivel, being, moved, to, the, side, of, the, gun, was, it, gave, a, clear, line, of, fire, an, advantage, to, the, matchlock, firing, mechanism, is, that, it, did, not, misfire, however, it, also, came, with, some, disadvantages, one, disadvantage, involved, weather, in, rain, the, match, could, not, be, kept, lit, to, fire, the, weapon, another, issue, with, the, match, was, it, could, give, away, the, position, of, soldiers, because, of, the, glow, sound, and, smell, while, european, pistols, were, equipped, with, wheellock, and, flintlock, mechanisms, asian, pistols, used, matchlock, mechanisms, the, wheellock, action, a, successor, to, the, matchlock, predated, the, flintlock, despite, its, many, faults, the, wheellock, was, a, significant, improvement, over, the, matchlock, in, terms, of, both, convenience, and, safety, since, it, eliminated, the, need, to, keep, a, smoldering, match, in, proximity, to, loose, gunpowder, it, operated, using, a, small, wheel, much, like, that, on, a, cigarette, lighter, which, was, wound, up, with, a, key, before, use, and, which, when, the, trigger, was, pulled, spun, against, a, flint, creating, the, shower, of, sparks, that, ignited, the, powder, in, the, touch, hole, supposedly, invented, by, leonardo, da, vinci, 1452, 1519, the, italian, renaissance, man, the, wheellock, action, was, an, innovation, that, was, not, widely, adopted, due, to, the, high, cost, of, the, clockwork, mechanism, the, flintlock, action, represented, a, major, innovation, in, firearm, design, the, spark, used, to, ignite, the, gunpowder, in, the, touch, hole, came, from, a, sharpened, piece, of, flint, clamped, in, the, jaws, of, a, cock, which, when, released, by, the, trigger, struck, a, piece, of, steel, called, the, frizzen, to, generate, the, necessary, sparks, the, spring, loaded, arm, that, holds, a, piece, of, flint, or, pyrite, is, referred, to, as, a, cock, because, of, its, resemblance, to, a, rooster, the, cock, had, to, be, manually, reset, after, each, firing, and, the, flint, had, to, be, replaced, periodically, due, to, wear, from, striking, the, frizzen, see, also, flintlock, mechanism, snaphance, miquelet, lock, the, flintlock, was, widely, used, during, the, 17th, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, in, both, muskets, and, rifles, percussion, caps, caplock, mechanisms, coming, into, wide, service, in, the, early, 19th, century, offered, a, dramatic, improvement, over, flintlocks, with, the, percussion, cap, mechanism, the, small, primer, charge, of, gunpowder, used, in, all, preceding, firearms, was, replaced, by, a, completely, self, contained, explosive, charge, contained, in, a, small, brass, cap, the, cap, was, fastened, to, the, touch, hole, of, the, gun, extended, to, form, a, nipple, and, ignited, by, the, impact, of, the, gun, s, hammer, the, hammer, is, roughly, the, same, as, the, cock, found, on, flintlocks, except, that, it, does, not, clamp, onto, anything, in, the, case, of, percussion, caps, the, hammer, was, hollow, on, the, end, to, fit, around, the, cap, in, order, to, keep, the, cap, from, fragmenting, and, injuring, the, shooter, once, struck, the, flame, from, the, cap, in, turn, ignited, the, main, charge, of, gunpowder, as, with, the, flintlock, but, there, was, no, longer, any, need, to, charge, the, touch, hole, with, gunpowder, and, even, better, the, touch, hole, was, no, longer, exposed, to, the, elements, as, a, result, the, percussion, cap, mechanism, was, considerably, safer, far, more, weatherproof, and, vastly, more, reliable, cloth, bound, cartridges, containing, a, pre, measured, charge, of, gunpowder, and, a, ball, had, been, in, regular, military, service, for, many, years, but, the, exposed, gunpowder, in, the, entry, to, the, touch, hole, had, long, been, a, source, of, misfires, all, muzzleloaders, manufactured, since, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, use, percussion, caps, except, those, built, as, replicas, of, the, flintlock, or, earlier, firearms, most, early, firearms, were, muzzle, loading, this, form, of, loading, has, several, disadvantages, such, as, a, slow, rate, of, fire, and, having, to, expose, oneself, to, enemy, fire, to, reload, as, the, weapon, had, to, be, pointed, upright, so, the, powder, could, be, poured, through, the, muzzle, into, the, breech, followed, by, the, ramming, the, projectile, into, the, breech, as, effective, methods, of, sealing, the, breech, developed, along, with, sturdy, weatherproof, self, contained, metallic, cartridges, muzzle, loaders, were, replaced, by, single, shot, breech, loaders, eventually, single, shot, weapons, were, replaced, by, the, following, repeater, type, weapons, many, firearms, made, from, the, late, 19th, century, through, the, 1950s, used, internal, magazines, to, load, the, cartridge, into, the, chamber, of, the, weapon, the, most, notable, and, revolutionary, weapons, of, this, period, appeared, during, the, u, s, civil, war, of, 1861, 1865, the, spencer, and, henry, repeating, rifles, both, used, fixed, tubular, magazines, the, former, having, the, magazine, in, the, buttstock, and, the, latter, under, the, barrel, which, allowed, a, larger, capacity, later, weapons, used, fixed, box, magazines, that, could, not, be, removed, from, the, weapon, without, disassembling, the, weapon, itself, fixed, magazines, permitted, the, use, of, larger, cartridges, and, eliminated, the, hazard, of, having, the, bullet, of, one, cartridge, butting, next, to, the, primer, or, rim, of, another, cartridge, these, magazines, are, loaded, while, they, are, in, the, weapon, often, using, a, stripper, clip, a, clip, is, used, to, transfer, cartridges, into, the, magazine, some, notable, weapons, that, use, internal, magazines, include, the, mosin, nagant, the, mauser, kar, 98k, the, springfield, m1903, the, m1, garand, and, the, sks, firearms, that, have, internal, magazines, are, usually, but, not, always, rifles, some, exceptions, to, this, include, the, mauser, c96, pistol, which, uses, an, internal, magazine, and, the, breda, 30, an, italian, light, machine, gun, many, modern, firearms, use, what, are, called, detachable, or, box, magazines, as, their, method, of, chambering, a, cartridge, detachable, magazines, can, be, removed, from, the, weapon, without, disassembling, the, firearms, usually, by, pushing, a, magazine, release, a, belt, or, ammunition, belt, a, device, used, to, retain, and, feed, cartridges, into, a, firearm, is, commonly, used, with, machine, guns, belts, were, originally, composed, of, canvas, or, cloth, with, pockets, spaced, evenly, to, allow, the, belt, to, be, mechanically, fed, into, the, gun, these, designs, were, prone, to, malfunctions, due, to, the, effects, of, oil, and, other, contaminants, altering, the, belt, later, belt, designs, used, permanently, connected, metal, links, to, retain, the, cartridges, during, feeding, these, belts, were, more, tolerant, to, exposure, to, solvents, and, oil, notable, weapons, that, use, belts, include, the, m240, the, m249, the, m134, minigun, and, the, pk, machine, gun, frenchman, louis, nicolas, flobert, invented, the, first, rimfire, metallic, cartridge, in, 1845, his, cartridge, consisted, of, a, percussion, cap, with, a, bullet, attached, to, the, top, flobert, then, made, what, he, called, parlor, guns, for, this, cartridge, as, these, rifles, and, pistols, were, designed, to, be, shot, in, indoor, shooting, parlors, in, large, homes, these, 6mm, flobert, cartridges, do, not, contain, any, powder, the, only, propellant, substance, contained, in, the, cartridge, is, the, percussion, cap, in, english, speaking, countries, the, 6mm, flobert, cartridge, corresponds, to, 22, bb, cap, and, 22, cb, cap, ammunition, these, cartridges, have, a, relatively, low, muzzle, velocity, of, around, 700, ft, s, 210, m, s, cartridges, represented, a, major, innovation, firearms, ammunition, previously, delivered, as, separate, bullets, and, powder, was, combined, in, a, single, metallic, usually, brass, cartridge, containing, a, percussion, cap, powder, and, a, bullet, in, one, weatherproof, package, the, main, technical, advantage, of, the, brass, cartridge, case, was, the, effective, and, reliable, sealing, of, high, pressure, gasses, at, the, breech, as, the, gas, pressure, forces, the, cartridge, case, to, expand, outward, pressing, it, firmly, against, the, inside, of, the, gun, barrel, chamber, this, prevents, the, leakage, of, hot, gas, which, could, injure, the, shooter, the, brass, cartridge, also, opened, the, way, for, modern, repeating, arms, by, uniting, the, bullet, gunpowder, and, primer, into, one, assembly, that, could, be, fed, reliably, into, the, breech, by, mechanical, action, in, the, firearm, before, this, a, cartridge, was, simply, a, pre, measured, quantity, of, gunpowder, together, with, a, ball, in, a, small, cloth, bag, or, rolled, paper, cylinder, which, also, acted, as, wadding, for, the, charge, and, ball, this, early, form, of, cartridge, had, to, be, rammed, into, the, muzzleloader, s, barrel, and, either, a, small, charge, of, gunpowder, in, the, touch, hole, or, an, external, percussion, cap, mounted, on, the, touch, hole, ignited, the, gunpowder, in, the, cartridge, cartridges, with, built, in, percussion, caps, called, primers, continue, to, this, day, to, be, the, standard, in, firearms, in, cartridge, firing, firearms, a, hammer, or, a, firing, pin, struck, by, the, hammer, strikes, the, cartridge, primer, which, then, ignites, the, gunpowder, within, the, primer, charge, is, at, the, base, of, the, cartridge, either, within, the, rim, a, rimfire, cartridge, or, in, a, small, percussion, cap, embedded, in, the, center, of, the, base, a, centerfire, cartridge, as, a, rule, centerfire, cartridges, are, more, powerful, than, rimfire, cartridges, operating, at, considerably, higher, pressures, than, rimfire, cartridges, centerfire, cartridges, are, also, safer, as, a, dropped, rimfire, cartridge, has, the, potential, to, discharge, if, its, rim, strikes, the, ground, with, sufficient, force, to, ignite, the, primer, this, is, practically, impossible, with, most, centerfire, cartridges, nearly, all, contemporary, firearms, load, cartridges, directly, into, their, breech, some, additionally, or, exclusively, load, from, a, magazine, that, holds, multiple, cartridges, a, magazine, is, a, part, of, the, firearm, which, exists, to, store, ammunition, and, to, assist, in, its, feeding, by, the, action, into, the, breech, such, as, through, the, rotation, of, a, revolver, s, cylinder, or, by, spring, loaded, platforms, in, most, pistol, and, rifle, designs, some, magazines, such, as, that, of, most, centerfire, hunting, rifles, and, all, revolvers, are, internal, to, and, inseparable, from, the, firearm, and, are, loaded, by, using, a, clip, a, clip, the, term, often, mistakenly, refers, to, a, detachable, magazine, is, a, device, that, holds, the, ammunition, by, the, rim, of, the, case, and, is, designed, to, assist, the, shooter, in, reloading, the, firearm, s, magazine, examples, include, revolver, speedloaders, the, stripper, clip, used, to, aid, loading, rifles, such, as, the, lee, enfield, or, mauser, 98, and, the, en, bloc, clip, used, in, loading, the, m1, garand, in, this, sense, magazines, and, clips, though, often, used, synonymously, refer, to, different, types, of, devices, many, firearms, are, single, shot, i, e, each, time, a, cartridge, is, fired, the, operator, must, manually, re, cock, the, firearm, and, load, another, cartridge, the, classic, single, barreled, shotgun, offers, a, good, example, a, firearm, that, can, load, multiple, cartridges, as, the, firearm, is, re, cocked, is, considered, a, repeating, firearm, or, simply, a, repeater, a, lever, action, rifle, a, pump, action, shotgun, and, most, bolt, action, rifles, are, good, examples, of, repeating, firearms, a, firearm, that, automatically, re, cocks, and, reloads, the, next, round, with, each, trigger, pull, is, considered, a, semi, automatic, or, autoloading, firearm, the, first, rapid, firing, firearms, were, usually, similar, to, the, 19th, century, gatling, gun, which, would, fire, cartridges, from, a, magazine, as, fast, as, and, as, long, as, the, operator, turned, a, crank, eventually, the, rapid, firing, mechanism, was, perfected, and, miniaturized, to, the, extent, that, either, the, recoil, of, the, firearm, or, the, gas, pressure, from, firing, could, be, used, to, operate, it, thus, the, operator, needed, only, to, pull, a, trigger, this, made, the, firing, mechanisms, truly, automatic, an, automatic, or, fully, automatic, firearm, automatically, re, cocks, reloads, and, fires, as, long, as, the, trigger, is, depressed, an, automatic, firearm, is, capable, of, firing, multiple, rounds, with, one, pull, of, the, trigger, the, gatling, gun, may, have, been, the, first, automatic, weapon, though, the, modern, trigger, actuated, machine, gun, was, not, widely, introduced, until, the, first, world, war, 1914, 1918, with, the, german, spandau, adopted, in, 1908, and, the, british, lewis, gun, in, service, from, 1914, automatic, rifles, such, as, the, browning, automatic, rifle, were, in, common, use, by, the, military, during, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, and, automatic, rifles, that, fired, handgun, rounds, known, as, submachine, guns, also, appeared, at, this, time, many, modern, military, firearms, have, a, selective, fire, option, which, is, a, mechanical, switch, that, allows, the, firearm, to, be, fired, either, in, the, semi, automatic, or, fully, automatic, mode, in, the, current, m16a2, and, m16a4, variants, of, the, u, s, made, m16, continuous, fully, automatic, fire, is, not, possible, having, been, replaced, by, an, automatic, burst, of, three, cartridges, this, conserves, ammunition, and, increases, controllability, automatic, weapons, are, largely, restricted, to, military, and, paramilitary, organizations, though, many, automatic, designs, are, infamous, for, their, use, by, civilians, firearm, hazard, is, quite, notable, with, a, significant, impact, on, the, health, system, in, 2001, for, quantification, purposes, it, was, estimated, that, the, cost, of, fatalities, and, injuries, was, us, 4700, million, per, year, in, canada, us, 170, per, canadian, and, us, 100, 000, million, per, year, in, the, u, s, us, 300, per, american, from, 1990, to, 2015, global, deaths, from, assault, by, firearm, rose, from, 128, 000, to, 173, 000, however, this, represents, a, drop, in, rate, from, 2, 41, 100, 000, to, 2, 35, 100, 000, as, world, population, has, increased, by, more, than, two, billion, in, 2017, there, were, 39, 773, gun, related, deaths, in, the, united, states, over, 60, were, suicides, from, firearms, in, 2001, firearms, were, involved, in, cases, constituting, the, second, leading, cause, of, mechanism, of, injury, deaths, which, are, deaths, which, occur, as, a, direct, identifiable, and, immediate, consequence, of, an, event, such, as, a, shooting, or, poisoning, and, do, not, include, deaths, due, to, natural, causes, or, indirect, causes, such, as, chronic, alcohol, abuse, or, tobacco, use, after, motor, vehicle, accidents, which, comprised, the, majority, of, deaths, in, this, category, the, most, recent, complete, data, from, 2017, shows, gunshot, related, homicides, as, having, been, the, 31st, most, common, cause, of, death, in, the, us, while, gunshot, related, suicides, was, the, 21st, most, common, cause, of, death, accidental, discharge, of, a, firearm, accounted, for, the, 59th, most, common, cause, of, death, with, 486, deaths, in, 2017, while, 616, individuals, were, killed, by, law, enforcement, comprising, the, 58th, most, common, cause, of, death, the, total, number, of, deaths, related, to, firearms, in, 2017, was, 38, 882, not, including, incidents, of, deaths, resulting, from, lethal, force, when, used, by, law, enforcement, while, the, most, common, cause, of, death, heart, disease, claimed, 647, 457, lives, over, sixteen, times, that, of, firearms, including, suicides, the, most, recent, data, from, the, cdc, from, 2020, shows, that, deaths, involving, firearms, accounted, for, about, 0, 2, of, all, deaths, nationwide, in, 2020, of, which, about, two, thirds, were, suicides, in, the, 52, high, and, middle, income, countries, with, a, combined, population, of, 1, 400, million, and, not, engaged, in, civil, conflict, fatalities, due, to, firearm, injuries, were, estimated, at, 115, 000, people, per, annum, in, the, 1990s, in, those, 52, countries, a, firearm, is, the, first, method, used, for, homicide, two, thirds, but, only, the, second, method, for, suicide, 20, to, prevent, unintentional, injury, gun, safety, training, includes, education, on, proper, firearm, storage, and, firearm, handling, etiquette, based, on, us, data, it, is, estimated, that, three, people, are, injured, for, one, killed, a, 2017, study, found, that, attacks, account, for, more, than, half, 50, 2, of, all, nonfatal, gun, injuries, while, unintentional, injuries, make, up, more, than, one, third, 36, 7, ptsd, or, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, is, extremely, prevalent, in, the, aftermath, of, different, firearm, related, events, such, as, mass, shootings, injuries, and, police, involved, incidents, in, particular, military, veterans, are, especially, at, high, risk, for, the, development, of, ptsd, in, 2004, hoge, et, al, found, that, soldiers, that, fought, in, iraq, or, afghanistan, who, significantly, engaged, in, firefights, had, a, linear, association, with, the, risk, of, ptsd, hoge, found, that, the, rates, of, ptsd, ranged, from, 4, 5, from, those, who, had, not, been, involved, in, firefights, to, 19, 3, to, those, involved, in, five, or, more, firefights, displaying, an, apparent, correlation, between, risk, of, ptsd, and, firefights, additionally, school, shootings, are, often, studied, and, exhibit, a, connection, between, ptsd, and, the, involvement, with, firearms, it, was, found, that, rates, of, ptsd, were, highest, in, students, that, were, in, direct, exposure, which, was, around, 9, 7, of, the, recorded, population, rates, would, be, as, low, as, 3, 4, in, those, with, no, exposure, many, bullets, used, with, firearms, are, made, of, lead, if, lead, reaches, the, bloodstream, which, can, occur, when, handling, ammunition, it, can, lead, to, kidney, damage, and, issues, with, brain, development, extremely, high, levels, can, lead, to, seizures, unconsciousness, and, even, death, a, common, hazard, of, repeated, firearm, use, is, noise, induced, hearing, loss, nihl, nihl, can, result, from, long, term, exposure, to, noise, or, from, high, intensity, impact, noises, such, as, gunshots, individuals, who, shoot, guns, often, have, a, characteristic, pattern, of, hearing, loss, referred, to, as, shooters, ear, they, often, have, a, high, frequency, loss, with, better, hearing, in, the, low, frequencies, and, one, ear, is, typically, worse, than, the, other, the, ear, on, the, side, the, shooter, is, holding, the, gun, will, receive, protection, from, the, sound, wave, from, the, shoulder, while, the, other, ear, remains, unprotected, and, more, susceptible, to, the, full, impact, of, the, sound, wave, the, intensity, of, a, gunshot, does, vary, lower, caliber, guns, are, typically, on, the, softer, side, while, higher, caliber, guns, are, often, louder, the, intensity, of, a, gunshot, though, typically, ranges, from, 140, db, to, 175, db, indoor, shooting, also, causes, loud, reverberations, which, can, also, be, as, damaging, as, the, actual, gunshot, itself, according, to, the, national, institute, on, deafness, and, other, communication, disorders, noise, above, 85, db, can, begin, to, cause, hearing, loss, while, many, sounds, cause, damage, over, time, at, the, intensity, level, of, a, gunshot, 140, db, or, louder, damage, to, the, ear, can, occur, instantly, shooters, use, custom, hearing, protection, such, as, electronic, type, hearing, protection, for, hunters, which, can, amplify, soft, sounds, like, leaves, crunching, while, reducing, the, intensity, of, the, gunshot, and, custom, hearing, protection, for, skeet, shooting, even, with, hearing, protection, due, to, the, high, intensity, of, the, noise, guns, produce, shooters, still, develop, hearing, loss, over, time, firearms, include, a, variety, of, ranged, weapons, and, there, is, no, agreed, upon, definition, for, instance, english, language, laws, of, big, legal, entities, such, as, the, united, states, india, the, european, union, and, canada, use, different, definitions, other, english,
