a, war, elephant, was, an, elephant, that, was, trained, and, guided, by, humans, for, combat, the, war, elephant, s, main, use, was, to, charge, the, enemy, break, their, ranks, and, instill, terror, and, fear, elephantry, is, a, term, for, specific, military, units, using, elephant, mounted, troops, war, elephants, played, a, critical, role, in, several, key, battles, in, antiquity, especially, in, ancient, india, while, seeing, limited, and, periodic, use, in, ancient, china, they, became, a, permanent, fixture, in, armies, of, historical, kingdoms, in, southeast, asia, during, classical, antiquity, they, were, also, used, in, ancient, persia, and, in, the, mediterranean, world, within, armies, of, macedon, hellenistic, greek, states, the, roman, republic, and, later, empire, and, ancient, carthage, in, north, africa, in, some, regions, they, maintained, a, firm, presence, on, the, battlefield, throughout, the, medieval, era, however, their, use, declined, with, the, spread, of, firearms, and, other, gunpowder, weaponry, in, early, modern, warfare, after, this, war, elephants, became, restricted, to, non, combat, engineering, and, labour, roles, as, well, as, being, used, for, minor, ceremonial, uses, they, continued, to, be, used, in, combat, however, in, some, parts, of, the, world, such, as, in, burma, thailand, and, vietnam, well, into, the, 19th, century, an, elephant, trainer, rider, or, keeper, is, called, a, mahout, mahouts, were, responsible, for, capturing, and, handling, elephants, to, accomplish, this, they, utilize, metal, chains, and, a, specialized, hook, called, an, ankus, or, elephant, goad, according, to, chanakya, as, recorded, in, the, arthashastra, first, the, mahout, would, have, to, get, the, elephant, used, to, being, led, the, elephant, would, have, learned, how, to, raise, its, legs, to, help, a, rider, climb, on, then, the, elephants, were, taught, to, run, and, maneuver, around, obstacles, and, move, in, formation, these, elephants, would, be, fit, to, learn, how, to, systematically, trample, and, charge, enemies, the, first, elephant, species, to, be, tamed, was, the, asian, elephant, for, use, in, agriculture, elephant, taming, not, full, domestication, as, they, are, still, captured, in, the, wild, rather, than, being, bred, in, captivity, may, have, begun, in, any, of, three, different, places, the, oldest, evidence, comes, from, the, indus, valley, civilization, around, roughly, 2000, bc, archaeological, evidence, for, the, presence, of, wild, elephants, in, the, yellow, river, valley, in, shang, china, c, 1600, 1100, bc, may, suggest, that, they, also, used, elephants, in, warfare, the, wild, elephant, populations, of, mesopotamia, and, china, declined, quickly, because, of, deforestation, and, human, population, growth, by, 850, bc, the, mesopotamian, elephants, were, extinct, and, by, 500, bc, the, chinese, elephants, were, seriously, reduced, in, numbers, and, limited, to, areas, well, south, of, the, yellow, river, capturing, elephants, from, the, wild, remained, a, difficult, task, but, a, necessary, one, given, the, difficulties, of, breeding, in, captivity, and, the, long, time, required, for, an, elephant, to, reach, sufficient, maturity, to, engage, in, battle, sixty, year, old, war, elephants, were, always, prized, as, being, at, the, most, suitable, age, for, battle, service, and, gifts, of, elephants, of, this, age, were, seen, as, particularly, generous, today, an, elephant, is, considered, in, its, prime, and, at, the, height, of, its, power, between, the, ages, of, 25, and, 40, yet, elephants, as, old, as, 80, are, used, in, tiger, hunts, because, they, are, more, disciplined, and, experienced, it, is, commonly, thought, that, the, reason, all, war, elephants, were, male, was, because, of, males, greater, aggression, but, it, was, instead, because, a, female, elephant, in, battle, will, run, from, a, male, therefore, only, males, could, be, used, in, war, whereas, female, elephants, were, more, commonly, used, for, logistics, according, to, the, first, book, of, maccabees, the, seleucids, used, the, blood, of, grapes, and, mulberries, to, provoke, their, war, elephants, in, preparation, for, battle, there, is, uncertainty, as, to, when, elephant, warfare, first, started, but, it, is, widely, accepted, that, it, began, in, ancient, india, the, early, vedic, period, did, not, extensively, specify, the, use, of, elephants, in, war, however, in, the, ramayana, indra, is, depicted, as, riding, either, airavata, a, mythological, elephant, or, on, the, uchchaihshravas, as, his, mounts, elephants, were, widely, utilized, in, warfare, by, the, later, vedic, period, by, the, 6th, century, bc, the, increased, conscription, of, elephants, in, the, military, history, of, india, coincides, with, the, expansion, of, the, vedic, kingdoms, into, the, indo, gangetic, plain, suggesting, its, introduction, during, the, intervening, period, the, practice, of, riding, on, elephants, in, peace, and, war, royalty, or, commoner, was, first, recorded, in, the, 6th, or, 5th, century, bc, this, practice, is, believed, to, be, much, older, than, proper, recorded, history, the, ancient, indian, epics, ramayana, and, mah, bh, rata, dating, from, 5th, 4th, century, bc, elaborately, depict, elephant, warfare, they, are, recognized, as, an, essential, component, of, royal, and, military, processions, in, ancient, india, initially, the, army, was, fourfold, chaturanga, consisting, of, infantry, cavalry, elephants, and, chariots, kings, and, princes, principally, ride, on, chariots, which, was, considered, the, most, royal, while, seldom, riding, the, back, of, elephants, although, viewed, as, secondary, to, chariots, by, royalty, elephants, were, the, preferred, vehicle, of, warriors, especially, the, elite, ones, while, the, chariots, eventually, fell, into, disuse, the, other, three, arms, continued, to, be, valued, many, characters, in, the, epic, mah, bh, rata, were, trained, in, the, art, according, to, the, rules, of, engagement, set, for, the, kurukshetra, war, two, men, were, to, duel, utilizing, the, same, weapon, and, mount, including, elephants, in, the, mah, bh, rata, the, akshauhini, battle, formation, consists, of, a, ratio, of, 1, chariot, 1, elephant, 3, cavalry, 5, infantry, soldiers, many, characters, in, the, mah, bh, rata, were, described, as, skilled, in, the, art, of, elephant, warfare, e, g, duryodhana, rides, an, elephant, into, battle, to, bolster, the, demoralized, kaurava, army, scriptures, like, the, nik, ya, and, vinaya, pitaka, assign, elephants, in, their, proper, place, in, the, organization, of, an, army, the, samyutta, nikaya, additionally, mentions, the, gautama, buddha, being, visited, by, a, hatth, roho, g, ma, i, he, is, the, head, of, a, village, community, bound, together, by, their, profession, as, mercenary, soldiers, forming, an, elephant, corp, ancient, indian, kings, certainly, valued, the, elephant, in, war, some, stating, that, an, army, without, elephants, is, as, despicable, as, a, forest, without, a, lion, a, kingdom, without, a, king, or, as, valor, unaided, by, weapons, the, use, of, elephants, further, increased, with, the, rise, of, the, mahajanapadas, king, bimbisara, c, 543, bc, who, began, the, expansion, of, the, magadha, kingdom, relied, heavily, on, his, war, elephants, the, mahajanapadas, would, be, conquered, by, the, nanda, empire, under, the, reign, of, mahapadma, nanda, pliny, the, elder, and, plutarch, also, estimated, the, nanda, army, strength, in, the, east, as, 200, 000, infantry, 80, 000, cavalry, 8, 000, chariots, and, 6, 000, war, elephants, alexander, the, great, would, come, in, contact, with, the, nanda, empire, on, the, banks, of, the, beas, river, and, was, forced, to, return, due, to, his, army, s, unwillingness, to, advance, even, if, the, numbers, and, prowess, of, these, elephants, were, exaggerated, by, historic, accounts, elephants, were, established, firmly, as, war, machines, in, this, period, chandragupta, maurya, 321, 297, bc, formed, the, maurya, empire, the, largest, empire, to, exist, in, south, asia, at, the, height, of, his, power, chandragupta, is, said, to, have, wielded, a, military, of, 600, 000, infantry, 30, 000, cavalry, 8, 000, chariots, and, 9, 000, war, elephants, besides, followers, and, attendants, in, the, mauryan, empire, the, 30, member, war, office, was, made, up, of, six, boards, the, sixth, board, looked, after, the, elephants, and, were, headed, by, gajadhyaksha, the, gajadhyaksha, was, the, superintendent, of, elephants, and, his, qualifications, the, use, of, elephants, in, the, maurya, empire, as, recorded, by, chanakya, in, the, arthashastra, according, to, chanakya, catching, training, and, controlling, war, elephants, was, one, of, the, most, important, skills, taught, by, the, military, academies, he, advised, chandragupta, to, set, up, forested, sanctuaries, for, the, wellness, of, the, elephants, chanakya, explicitly, conveyed, the, importance, of, these, sanctuaries, the, maurya, empire, would, reach, its, zenith, under, the, reign, of, ashoka, who, used, elephants, extensively, during, his, conquest, during, the, kalinga, war, kalinga, had, a, standing, army, of, 60, 000, infantry, 1000, cavalry, and, 700, war, elephants, kalinga, was, notable, for, the, quality, of, their, war, elephants, which, were, prized, by, its, neighbors, for, being, stronger, later, the, king, kharavela, was, to, restore, an, independent, kalinga, into, a, powerful, kingdom, using, war, elephants, as, stated, in, the, hathigumpha, inscription, or, elephant, cave, inscriptions, following, indian, accounts, foreign, rulers, would, also, adopt, the, use, of, elephants, the, chola, empire, of, tamil, nadu, also, had, a, very, strong, elephant, force, the, chola, emperor, rajendra, chola, had, an, armored, elephant, force, which, played, a, major, role, in, his, campaigns, sri, lanka, made, extensive, use, of, elephants, and, also, exported, elephants, with, pliny, the, elder, stating, that, the, sri, lankan, elephants, for, example, were, larger, fiercer, and, better, for, war, than, local, elephants, this, superiority, as, well, as, the, proximity, of, the, supply, to, seaports, made, sri, lanka, s, elephants, a, lucrative, trading, commodity, sri, lankan, history, records, indicate, elephants, were, used, as, mounts, for, kings, leading, their, men, in, the, battlefield, with, individual, mounts, being, recorded, in, history, the, elephant, kandula, was, king, dutugamunu, s, mount, and, maha, pambata, big, rock, the, mount, of, king, ellalan, during, their, historic, encounter, on, the, battlefield, in, 200, bc, for, example, elephants, were, used, for, warfare, in, china, by, a, small, handful, of, southern, dynasties, the, state, of, chu, used, elephants, in, 506, bc, against, wu, by, tying, torches, to, their, tails, and, sending, them, into, the, ranks, of, the, enemy, soldiers, but, the, attempt, failed, in, december, 554, ad, the, liang, dynasty, used, armoured, war, elephants, carrying, towers, against, western, wei, they, were, defeated, by, a, volley, of, arrows, the, southern, han, dynasty, is, the, only, state, in, chinese, history, to, have, kept, a, permanent, corps, of, war, elephants, these, elephants, were, able, to, carry, a, tower, with, some, ten, people, on, their, backs, they, were, used, successfully, during, the, han, invasion, of, ma, chu, in, 948, in, 970, the, song, dynasty, invaded, southern, han, and, their, crossbowmen, readily, routed, the, han, elephants, on, 23, january, 971, during, the, taking, of, shao, that, was, the, last, time, elephants, were, used, in, chinese, warfare, although, the, wanli, emperor, r, 1572, 1620, did, keep, a, herd, of, elephants, capable, of, carrying, a, tower, and, eight, men, which, he, showed, to, his, guests, in, 1598, these, elephants, were, probably, not, native, to, china, and, were, delivered, to, the, ming, dynasty, by, southeast, asian, countries, such, as, siam, during, the, revolt, of, the, three, feudatories, the, rebels, used, elephants, against, the, qing, dynasty, but, the, qing, bannermen, shot, them, with, so, many, arrows, that, they, resembled, porcupines, and, repelled, the, elephant, charge, the, soldiers, of, the, first, column, were, attacked, by, the, elephants, the, flags, of, major, general, of, the, guards, walda, of, the, yellow, banner, and, of, lieutenant, ulehi, of, the, manchu, mongol, cavalry, were, captured, as, the, elephants, closed, in, on, the, encircled, soldiers, of, the, second, column, the, arrows, shot, by, all, of, my, men, looked, like, the, quills, of, a, porcupine, the, elephants, fled, towards, the, hills, i, was, greatly, alarmed, and, had, a, strange, feeling, the, rebels, withdrew, from, the, plain, and, split, into, groups, in, the, thick, forest, of, the, mountain, chinese, armies, faced, off, against, war, elephants, in, southeast, asia, such, as, during, the, sui, l, m, p, war, 605, l, song, war, 1075, 1077, ming, mong, mao, war, 1386, 1388, and, ming, h, war, 1406, 1407, in, 605, the, champa, kingdom, of, l, m, p, in, what, is, now, southern, vietnam, used, elephants, against, the, invading, army, of, china, s, sui, dynasty, the, sui, army, dug, pits, and, lured, the, elephants, into, them, and, shot, them, with, crossbows, causing, the, elephants, to, turn, back, and, trample, their, own, army, in, 1075, the, song, defeated, elephants, deployed, on, the, borderlands, of, i, vi, t, during, the, l, song, war, the, song, forces, used, scythed, polearms, to, cut, the, elephants, trunks, causing, them, to, trample, their, own, troops, during, the, mong, mao, campaign, the, elephants, were, routed, by, an, assortment, of, gunpowder, projectiles, in, the, war, against, the, h, dynasty, ming, troops, covered, their, horses, with, lion, masks, to, scare, the, elephants, and, shot, them, with, firearms, the, elephants, all, trembled, with, fear, and, were, wounded, by, the, guns, and, arrows, causing, the, viet, army, to, panic, from, india, military, thinking, on, the, use, of, war, elephants, spread, westwards, to, the, persian, achaemenid, empire, where, they, were, used, in, several, campaigns, they, in, turn, came, to, influence, the, campaigns, of, alexander, the, great, king, of, macedonia, in, hellenistic, greece, the, first, confrontation, between, europeans, and, the, persian, war, elephants, occurred, at, alexander, s, battle, of, gaugamela, 331, bc, where, the, persians, deployed, fifteen, elephants, these, elephants, were, placed, at, the, centre, of, the, persian, line, and, made, such, an, impression, on, alexander, s, army, that, he, felt, the, need, to, sacrifice, to, phobos, the, god, of, fear, the, night, before, the, battle, but, according, to, some, sources, the, elephants, ultimately, failed, to, deploy, in, the, final, battle, owing, to, their, long, march, the, day, before, alexander, won, resoundingly, at, gaugamela, but, was, deeply, impressed, by, the, enemy, elephants, and, took, these, first, fifteen, into, his, own, army, adding, to, their, number, during, his, capture, of, the, rest, of, persia, by, the, time, alexander, reached, the, borders, of, india, five, years, later, he, had, a, substantial, number, of, elephants, under, his, own, command, when, it, came, to, defeating, porus, who, ruled, in, what, is, now, punjab, pakistan, alexander, found, himself, facing, a, considerable, force, of, between, 85, and, 100, war, elephants, at, the, battle, of, the, hydaspes, preferring, stealth, and, mobility, to, sheer, force, alexander, manoeuvered, and, engaged, with, just, his, infantry, and, cavalry, ultimately, defeating, porus, forces, including, his, elephant, corps, albeit, at, some, cost, porus, for, his, part, placed, his, elephants, individually, at, long, intervals, from, each, other, a, short, distance, in, front, of, his, main, infantry, line, in, order, to, scare, off, macedonian, cavalry, attacks, and, aid, his, own, infantry, in, their, struggle, against, the, phalanx, the, elephants, caused, many, losses, with, their, tusks, fitted, with, iron, spikes, or, by, lifting, the, enemies, with, their, trunks, and, trampling, them, arrian, described, the, subsequent, fight, herever, the, beasts, could, wheel, around, they, rushed, forth, against, the, ranks, of, infantry, and, demolished, the, phalanx, of, the, macedonians, dense, as, it, was, the, macedonians, adopted, the, standard, ancient, tactic, for, fighting, elephants, loosening, their, ranks, to, allow, the, elephants, to, pass, through, and, assailing, them, with, javelins, as, they, tried, to, wheel, around, they, managed, to, pierce, the, unarmoured, elephants, legs, the, panicked, and, wounded, elephants, turned, on, the, indians, themselves, the, mahouts, were, armed, with, poisoned, rods, to, kill, the, beasts, but, were, slain, by, javelins, and, archers, looking, further, east, again, however, alexander, could, see, that, the, emperors, and, kings, of, the, nanda, empire, and, gangaridai, could, deploy, between, 3, 000, and, 6, 000, war, elephants, such, a, force, was, many, times, larger, than, the, number, of, elephants, employed, by, the, persians, and, greeks, which, probably, discouraged, alexander, s, army, and, effectively, halted, their, advance, into, india, on, his, return, alexander, established, a, force, of, elephants, to, guard, his, palace, at, babylon, and, created, the, post, of, elephantarch, to, lead, his, elephant, units, the, successful, military, use, of, elephants, spread, further, the, successors, to, alexander, s, empire, the, diadochi, used, hundreds, of, indian, elephants, in, their, wars, with, the, seleucid, empire, being, particularly, notable, for, their, use, of, the, animals, still, being, largely, brought, from, india, indeed, the, seleucid, mauryan, war, of, 305, 303, bc, ended, with, the, seleucids, ceding, vast, eastern, territories, in, exchange, for, 500, war, elephants, a, small, part, of, the, mauryan, forces, which, included, up, to, 9000, elephants, by, some, accounts, the, seleucids, put, their, new, elephants, to, good, use, at, the, battle, of, ipsus, four, years, later, where, they, blocked, the, return, of, the, victorious, antigonid, cavalry, allowing, the, latter, s, phalanx, to, be, isolated, and, defeated, the, first, use, of, war, elephants, in, europe, was, made, in, 318, bc, by, polyperchon, one, of, alexander, s, generals, when, he, besieged, megalopolis, in, the, peloponnesus, during, the, wars, of, the, diadochi, he, used, 60, elephants, brought, from, asia, with, their, mahouts, a, veteran, of, alexander, s, army, named, damis, helped, the, besieged, megalopolitians, to, defend, themselves, against, the, elephants, and, eventually, polyperchon, was, defeated, those, elephants, were, subsequently, taken, by, cassander, and, transported, partly, by, sea, to, other, battlefields, in, greece, it, is, assumed, that, cassander, constructed, the, first, elephant, transport, sea, vessels, some, of, the, elephants, died, of, starvation, in, 316, bc, in, the, besieged, city, of, pydna, in, macedonia, others, of, polyperchon, s, elephants, were, used, in, various, parts, of, greece, by, cassander, although, the, use, of, war, elephants, in, the, western, mediterranean, is, most, famously, associated, with, the, wars, between, carthage, and, roman, republic, the, introduction, of, war, elephants, there, was, primarily, the, result, of, an, invasion, by, hellenistic, era, epirus, across, the, adriatic, sea, king, pyrrhus, of, epirus, brought, twenty, elephants, to, attack, roman, italy, at, the, battle, of, heraclea, in, 280, bc, leaving, some, fifty, additional, animals, on, loan, from, ptolemaic, pharaoh, ptolemy, ii, on, the, mainland, the, romans, were, unprepared, for, fighting, elephants, and, the, epirot, forces, routed, the, romans, the, next, year, the, epirots, again, deployed, a, similar, force, of, elephants, attacking, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, asculum, this, time, the, romans, came, prepared, with, flammable, weapons, and, anti, elephant, devices, these, were, ox, drawn, wagons, equipped, with, long, spikes, to, wound, the, elephants, pots, of, fire, to, scare, them, and, accompanying, screening, troops, who, would, hurl, javelins, at, the, elephants, to, drive, them, away, a, final, charge, of, epirot, elephants, won, the, day, again, but, this, time, pyrrhus, had, suffered, very, heavy, casualties, a, pyrrhic, victory, the, seleucid, king, antiochus, v, eupator, whose, father, and, he, contended, with, ptolemaic, egypt, s, ruler, ptolemy, vi, for, control, of, syria, invaded, judea, in, 161, bce, with, eighty, elephants, some, sources, claim, thirty, two, some, of, which, were, clad, in, armored, breastplates, in, an, attempt, to, subdue, the, jews, who, had, revolted, during, the, maccabean, revolt, in, the, ensuing, battle, near, the, mountainous, straights, adjacent, to, beth, zachariah, eleazar, brother, of, judas, maccabeus, attacked, the, largest, of, the, elephants, piercing, its, underside, and, causing, it, to, collapse, upon, him, killing, him, under, its, weight, the, north, african, elephant, was, a, significant, animal, in, nubian, culture, they, were, depicted, on, the, walls, of, temples, and, on, meroitic, lamps, kushite, kings, also, utilize, war, elephants, which, are, believed, to, have, been, kept, and, trained, in, the, great, enclosure, at, musawwarat, al, sufa, the, kingdom, of, kush, provided, these, war, elephants, to, the, egyptians, ptolemies, and, syrians, the, ptolemaic, egypt, and, the, punics, began, acquiring, african, elephants, for, the, same, purpose, as, did, numidia, and, the, kingdom, of, kush, the, animal, used, was, the, north, african, elephant, loxodonta, africana, pharaohensis, which, would, become, extinct, from, overexploitation, these, animals, were, smaller, and, harder, to, tame, and, could, not, swim, deep, rivers, compared, with, the, asian, elephants, used, by, the, seleucid, empire, on, the, east, of, the, mediterranean, region, particularly, syrian, elephants, which, stood, 2, 5, 3, 5, meters, 8, 2, 11, 5, ft, at, the, shoulder, it, is, likely, that, at, least, some, syrian, elephants, were, traded, abroad, the, favorite, and, perhaps, last, surviving, elephant, of, hannibal, s, crossing, of, the, alps, was, an, impressive, animal, named, surus, the, syrian, which, may, have, been, of, syrian, stock, though, the, evidence, remains, ambiguous, since, the, late, 1940s, a, strand, of, scholarship, has, argued, that, the, african, forest, elephants, used, by, numidia, the, ptolemies, and, the, military, of, carthage, did, not, carry, howdahs, or, turrets, in, combat, perhaps, owing, to, the, physical, weakness, of, the, species, some, allusions, to, turrets, in, ancient, literature, are, certainly, anachronistic, or, poetic, invention, but, other, references, are, less, easily, discounted, there, is, explicit, contemporary, testimony, that, the, army, of, juba, i, of, numidia, included, turreted, elephants, in, 46, bc, this, is, confirmed, by, the, image, of, a, turreted, african, elephant, used, on, the, coinage, of, juba, ii, this, also, appears, to, be, the, case, with, ptolemaic, armies, polybius, reports, that, at, the, battle, of, raphia, in, 217, bc, the, elephants, of, ptolemy, iv, carried, turrets, these, elephants, were, significantly, smaller, than, the, asian, elephants, fielded, by, the, seleucids, and, so, presumably, african, forest, elephants, there, is, also, evidence, that, carthaginian, war, elephants, were, furnished, with, turrets, and, howdahs, in, certain, military, contexts, farther, south, tribes, would, have, had, access, to, the, african, savanna, elephant, loxodonta, africana, oxyotis, although, much, larger, than, either, the, african, forest, elephant, or, the, asian, elephant, these, proved, difficult, to, tame, for, war, purposes, and, were, not, used, extensively, asian, elephants, were, traded, westwards, to, the, mediterranean, markets, with, sri, lankan, elephants, being, particularly, preferred, for, war, perhaps, inspired, by, the, victories, of, pyrrhus, of, epirus, carthage, developed, its, own, use, of, war, elephants, and, deployed, them, extensively, during, the, first, and, second, punic, wars, the, performance, of, the, carthaginian, elephant, corps, was, rather, mixed, illustrating, the, need, for, proper, tactics, to, take, advantage, of, the, elephant, s, strength, and, cover, its, weaknesses, at, adyss, in, 255, bc, the, carthaginian, elephants, were, ineffective, due, to, the, terrain, while, at, the, battle, of, panormus, in, 251, bc, the, romans, velites, were, able, to, terrify, the, carthaginian, elephants, being, used, unsupported, which, fled, from, the, field, at, the, battle, of, tunis, however, the, charge, of, the, carthaginian, elephants, helped, to, disorder, the, legions, allowing, the, carthaginian, phalanx, to, stand, fast, and, defeat, the, romans, during, the, second, punic, war, hannibal, famously, led, an, army, of, war, elephants, across, the, alps, although, many, of, them, perished, in, the, harsh, conditions, the, surviving, elephants, were, successfully, used, in, the, battle, of, trebia, where, they, panicked, the, roman, cavalry, and, gallic, allies, the, romans, eventually, developed, effective, anti, elephant, tactics, leading, to, hannibal, s, defeat, at, his, final, battle, of, zama, in, 202, bc, his, elephant, charge, unlike, the, one, at, the, battle, of, tunis, was, ineffective, because, the, disciplined, roman, maniples, simply, made, way, for, them, to, pass, rome, brought, back, many, elephants, at, the, end, of, the, punic, wars, and, used, them, in, its, campaigns, for, many, years, afterwards, the, conquest, of, greece, saw, many, battles, in, which, the, romans, deployed, war, elephants, including, the, invasion, of, macedonia, in, 199, bc, the, battle, of, cynoscephalae, 197, bc, the, battle, of, thermopylae, and, the, battle, of, magnesia, in, 190, bc, during, which, antiochus, iii, s, fifty, four, elephants, took, on, the, roman, force, of, sixteen, in, later, years, the, romans, deployed, twenty, two, elephants, at, pydna, in, 168, bc, the, role, of, the, elephant, force, at, cynoscephalae, was, particularly, decisive, as, their, quick, charge, shattered, the, unformed, macedonian, left, wing, allowing, the, romans, to, encircle, and, destroy, the, victorious, macedonian, right, a, similar, event, also, occurred, at, pydna, the, romans, successful, use, of, war, elephants, against, the, macedonians, might, be, considered, ironic, given, that, it, was, pyrrhus, who, first, taught, them, the, military, potential, of, elephants, elephants, also, featured, throughout, the, roman, campaign, against, the, lusitanians, and, celtiberians, in, hispania, during, the, second, celtiberian, war, quintus, fulvius, nobilior, was, helped, by, ten, elephants, sent, by, king, masinissa, of, numidia, he, deployed, them, against, the, celtiberian, forces, of, numantia, but, a, falling, stone, hit, one, of, the, elephants, which, panicked, and, frightened, the, rest, turning, them, against, the, roman, forces, after, the, subsequent, celtiberian, counterattack, the, romans, were, forced, to, withdraw, later, quintus, fabius, maximus, servilianus, marched, against, viriathus, with, another, ten, elephants, sent, by, king, micipsa, however, the, lusitanian, style, of, ambushes, in, narrow, terrains, ensured, his, elephants, did, not, play, an, important, factor, in, the, conflict, and, servilianus, was, eventually, defeated, by, viriathus, in, the, city, of, erisana, famously, the, romans, used, a, war, elephant, in, their, first, invasion, of, britain, one, ancient, writer, recording, that, caesar, had, one, large, elephant, which, was, equipped, with, armor, and, carried, archers, and, slingers, in, its, tower, when, this, unknown, creature, entered, the, river, the, britons, and, their, horses, fled, and, the, roman, army, crossed, over, although, he, may, have, confused, this, incident, with, the, use, of, a, similar, war, elephant, in, claudius, final, conquest, of, britain, at, least, one, elephantine, skeleton, with, flint, weapons, that, has, been, found, in, england, was, initially, misidentified, as, these, elephants, but, later, dating, proved, it, to, be, a, mammoth, skeleton, from, the, stone, age, in, the, african, campaign, of, the, roman, civil, war, of, 49, 45, bc, the, army, of, metellus, scipio, used, elephants, against, caesar, s, army, at, the, battle, of, thapsus, scipio, trained, his, elephants, before, the, battle, by, aligning, the, elephants, in, front, of, slingers, that, would, throw, rocks, at, them, and, another, line, of, slingers, at, the, elephants, rear, to, perform, the, same, in, order, to, propel, the, elephants, only, in, one, direction, preventing, them, turning, their, backs, because, of, frontal, attack, and, charging, against, his, own, lines, but, the, author, of, de, bello, africano, admits, of, the, enormous, effort, and, time, required, to, accomplish, this, by, the, time, of, claudius, however, such, animals, were, being, used, by, the, romans, in, single, numbers, only, the, last, significant, use, of, war, elephants, in, the, mediterranean, was, against, the, romans, at, the, battle, of, thapsus, 46, bc, where, julius, caesar, armed, his, fifth, legion, alaudae, with, axes, and, commanded, his, legionaries, to, strike, at, the, elephant, s, legs, the, legion, withstood, the, charge, and, the, elephant, became, its, symbol, thapsus, was, the, last, significant, use, of, elephants, in, the, west, the, remainder, of, the, elephants, seemed, to, have, been, thrown, into, panic, by, caesar, s, archers, and, slingers, the, parthian, empire, occasionally, used, war, elephants, in, their, battles, against, the, roman, empire, having, done, so, in, at, least, one, war, against, the, romans, but, elephants, were, of, substantial, importance, in, the, army, of, the, subsequent, sassanid, empire, the, sasanian, war, elephants, are, recorded, in, engagements, against, the, romans, such, as, during, julian, s, invasion, of, persia, other, examples, include, the, battle, of, vartanantz, in, 451, ad, at, which, the, sassanid, elephants, terrified, the, armenians, and, the, battle, of, al, q, disiyyah, of, 636, ad, in, which, a, unit, of, thirty, three, elephants, was, used, against, the, invading, arab, muslims, in, which, battle, the, war, elephants, proved, to, be, a, double, edged, sword, the, sassanid, elephant, corps, held, primacy, amongst, the, sassanid, cavalry, forces, and, was, recruited, from, india, the, elephant, corps, was, under, a, special, chief, known, as, the, zend, hapet, literally, meaning, commander, of, the, indians, either, because, the, animals, came, from, that, country, or, because, they, were, managed, by, natives, of, hindustan, the, sassanid, elephant, corps, was, never, on, the, same, scale, as, others, further, east, however, and, after, the, fall, of, the, sassanid, empire, the, use, of, war, elephants, died, out, in, the, region, the, kingdom, of, aksum, in, what, is, now, ethiopia, and, eritrea, made, use, of, war, elephants, in, 525, ad, during, the, invasion, of,

the, am, al, fil, arabic, year, of, the, elephant, approximately, equating, to, 570, ad, at, that, time, abraha, the, christian, ruler, of, yemen, marched, upon, the, ka, bah, in, mecca, intending, to, demolish, it, he, had, a, large, army, which, included, one, or, more, elephants, as, many, as, eight, in, some, accounts, however, the, single, or, lead, elephant, whose, name, was, mahmud, is, said, to, have, stopped, at, the, boundary, around, mecca, and, refused, to, enter, which, was, taken, by, both, the, meccans, and, their, yemenite, foes, as, a, serious, omen, according, to, islamic,

fight, the, danes, in, 804, and, the, crusades, gave, holy, roman, emperor, frederick, ii, the, opportunity, to, capture, an, elephant, in, the, holy, land, the, same, animal, later, being, used, in, the, capture, of, cremona, in, 1214, but, the, use, of, these, individual, animals, was, more, symbolic, than, practical, especially, when, contrasting, food, and, water, consumption, of, elephants, in, foreign, lands, and, the, harsh, conditions, of, the, crusades, the, mongols, faced, war, elephants, in, khorazm, burma, siam, vietnam, khmer, and, india, throughout, the, 13th, century, despite, their, unsuccessful, campaigns, in, vietnam, and, india, the, mongols, defeated, the, war, elephants, outside, samarkand, by, using, catapults, and, mangonels, and, during, the, mongol, invasions, of,

central, asian, invader, timur, faced, similar, challenges, a, century, later, in, the, sack, of, delhi, timur, s, army, faced, more, than, one, hundred, indian, elephants, in, battle, and, almost, lost, because, of, the, fear, they, caused, amongst, his, troops, historical, accounts, say, that, the, timurids, ultimately, won, by, employing, an, ingenious, strategy, timur, tied, flaming, straw, to, the, back, of, his, camels, before, the, charge, the, smoke, made, the, camels, run, forward, scaring, the, elephants, who, crushed, their, own, troops, in, their, efforts, to, retreat, another,

against, the, ottoman, empire, in, southeast, asia, the, powerful, khmer, empire, had, come, to, regional, dominance, by, the, 9th, century, ad, drawing, heavily, on, the, use, of, war, elephants, uniquely, the, khmer, military, deployed, double, cross, bows, on, the, top, of, their, elephants, with, the, collapse, of, khmer, power, in, the, 15th, century, the, successor, region, powers, of, burma, now, myanmar, and, siam, now, thailand, also, adopted, the, widespread, use, of, war, elephants, in, many, battles, of, the, period, it, was, the, practice, for, leaders, to, fight, each, other, personally, in, elephant, duels, one, famous, battle, occurred, when, the, burmese, army, attacked, siam, s, kingdom, of, ayutthaya, the, war, may, have, been, concluded, when, the, burmese, crown, prince, mingyi, swa, was, killed, by, siamese, king, naresuan, in, personal, combat, on, elephant, in, 1593, however, this, duel, may, be, apocryphal, in, thailand, the, king, or, general, rode, on, the, elephant, s, neck, and, carried, ngaw, a, long, pole, with, a, sabre, at, the, end, plus, a, metal, hook, for, controlling, the, elephant, sitting, behind, him, on, a, howdah, was, a, signaller, who, signalled, by, waving, of, a, pair, of, peacock, feathers, above, the, signaller, was, the, chatras, consisting, of, progressively, stacked, circular, canopies, the, number, signifying, the, rank, of, the, rider, finally, behind, the, signaller, on, the, elephant, s, back, was, the, steerer, who, steered, via, a, long, pole, the, steerer, may, have, also, carried, a, short, musket, and, a, sword, 40, 41, in, malaysia, 20, elephants, battled, the, portuguese, during, the, capture, of, malacca, 1511, the, chinese, continued, to, reject, the, use, of, war, elephants, throughout, the, period, with, the, notable, exception, of, the, southern, han, during, the, 10th, century, ad, the, only, nation, on, chinese, soil, ever, to, maintain, a, line, of, elephants, as, a, regular, part, of, its, army, this, anomaly, in, chinese, warfare, is, explained, by, the, geographical, proximity, and, close, cultural, links, of, the, southern, han, to, southeast, asia, the, military, officer, who, commanded, these, elephants, was, given, the, title, legate, digitant, and, agitant, of, the, gigantic, elephants, each, elephant, supported, a, wooden, tower, that, could, allegedly, hold, ten, or, more, men, for, a, brief, time, war, elephants, played, a, vital, role, in, southern, han, victories, such, as, the, invasion, of, chu, in, 948, ad, but, the, southern, han, elephant, corps, were, ultimately, soundly, defeated, at, shao, in, 971, ad, defeated, by, crossbow, shooting, from, troops, of, the, song, dynasty, as, one, academic, has, put, it, thereafter, this, exotic, introduction, into, chinese, culture, passed, out, of, history, and, the, tactical, habits, of, the, north, prevailed, however, as, late, as, the, ming, dynasty, in, as, far, north, as, beijing, there, were, still, records, of, elephants, being, used, in, chinese, warfare, namely, in, 1449, where, a, vietnamese, contingent, of, war, elephants, helped, the, ming, dynasty, defend, the, city, from, the, mongols, with, the, advent, of, gunpowder, warfare, in, the, late, 15th, century, the, balance, of, advantage, for, war, elephants, on, the, battlefield, began, to, change, while, muskets, had, limited, impact, on, elephants, which, could, withstand, numerous, volleys, cannon, fire, was, a, different, matter, entirely, an, animal, could, easily, be, knocked, down, by, a, single, shot, with, elephants, still, being, used, to, carry, commanders, on, the, battlefield, they, became, even, more, tempting, targets, for, enemy, artillery, nonetheless, in, south, east, asia, the, use, of, elephants, on, the, battlefield, continued, up, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, one, of, the, major, difficulties, in, the, region, was, terrain, and, elephants, could, cross, difficult, terrain, in, many, cases, more, easily, than, horse, cavalry, burmese, forces, used, war, elephants, against, the, chinese, in, the, sino, burmese, war, where, they, routed, the, chinese, cavalry, the, burmese, used, them, again, during, the, battle, of, danubyu, during, the, first, anglo, burmese, war, where, the, elephants, were, easily, repulsed, by, congreve, rockets, deployed, by, british, forces, the, siamese, army, continued, utilising, war, elephants, armed, with, jingals, up, until, the, franco, siamese, conflict, of, 1893, while, the, vietnamese, used, them, in, battle, as, late, as, 1885, during, the, sino, french, war, during, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, british, forces, in, india, possessed, specialised, elephant, batteries, to, haul, large, siege, artillery, pieces, over, ground, unsuitable, for, oxen, into, the, 20th, century, military, elephants, were, used, for, non, combat, purposes, in, the, second, world, war, particularly, because, the, animals, could, perform, tasks, in, regions, that, were, problematic, for, motor, vehicles, sir, william, slim, commander, of, the, xivth, army, wrote, about, elephants, in, his, introduction, to, elephant, bill, they, built, hundreds, of, bridges, for, us, they, helped, to, build, and, launch, more, ships, for, us, than, helen, ever, did, for, greece, without, them, our, retreat, from, burma, would, have, been, even, more, arduous, and, our, advance, to, its, liberation, slower, and, more, difficult, military, elephants, were, used, as, late, as, the, vietnam, war, elephants, were, as, of, 2017, being, used, by, the, kachin, independence, army, for, an, auxiliary, role, elephants, are, now, more, valuable, to, many, armies, in, failing, states, for, their, ivory, than, as, transport, and, many, thousands, of, elephants, have, died, during, civil, conflicts, due, to, poaching, they, are, classed, as, a, pack, animal, in, a, u, s, special, forces, field, manual, issued, as, recently, as, 2004, but, their, use, by, u, s, personnel, is, discouraged, because, elephants, are, endangered, there, were, many, military, purposes, for, which, elephants, could, be, used, in, battle, war, elephants, were, usually, deployed, in, the, centre, of, the, line, where, they, could, be, useful, to, prevent, a, charge, or, to, conduct, one, of, their, own, their, sheer, size, and, their, terrifying, appearance, made, them, valued, heavy, cavalry, off, the, battlefield, they, could, carry, heavy, materiel, and, with, a, top, speed, of, approximately, 30, kilometres, per, hour, 19, mph, provided, a, useful, means, of, transport, before, mechanized, vehicles, rendered, them, mostly, obsolete, in, addition, to, charging, elephants, could, provide, a, safe, and, stable, platform, for, archers, to, shoot, arrows, in, the, middle, of, the, battlefield, from, which, more, targets, could, be, seen, and, engaged, the, driver, called, a, mahout, was, responsible, for, controlling, the, animal, who, often, also, carried, weapons, himself, like, a, chisel, blade, and, a, hammer, to, kill, his, own, mount, in, an, emergency, elephants, were, sometimes, further, enhanced, with, their, own, weaponry, and, armour, as, well, in, india, and, sri, lanka, heavy, iron, chains, with, steel, balls, at, the, end, were, tied, to, their, trunks, which, the, animals, were, trained, to, swirl, menacingly, and, with, great, skill, numerous, cultures, designed, specialized, equipment, for, elephants, like, tusk, swords, and, a, protective, tower, on, their, backs, called, howdahs, the, late, sixteenth, century, saw, the, introduction, of, culverins, jingals, and, rockets, against, elephants, innovations, that, would, ultimately, drive, these, animals, out, of, active, service, on, the, battlefield, besides, the, dawn, of, more, efficient, means, of, transportation, and, weaponry, war, elephants, also, had, clear, tactical, weaknesses, that, lead, to, their, eventual, retirement, after, sustaining, painful, wounds, or, when, their, driver, was, killed, elephants, had, the, tendency, to, panic, often, causing, them, to, run, amok, indiscriminately, making, casualties, on, either, side, experienced, roman, infantrymen, often, tried, to, sever, their, trunks, causing, instant, distress, and, possibly, leading, the, elephant, to, flee, back, into, its, own, lines, fast, skirmishers, armed, with, javelins, were, also, used, by, the, romans, to, drive, them, away, as, well, as, flaming, objects, or, a, stout, line, of, long, spears, such, as, triarii, another, method, for, disrupting, elephant, units, in, classical, antiquity, was, the, deployment, of, war, pigs, ancient, writers, believed, that, elephants, could, be, scared, by, the, smallest, squeal, of, a, pig, some, warlords, however, interpreted, this, expression, literally, at, the, siege, of, megara, during, the, diadochi, wars, for, example, the, megarians, reportedly, poured, oil, on, a, herd, of, pigs, set, them, alight, and, drove, them, towards, the, enemy, s, massed, war, elephants, which, subsequently, bolted, in, terror, the, value, of, war, elephants, in, battle, remains, a, contested, issue, in, the, 19th, century, it, was, fashionable, to, contrast, the, western, roman, focus, on, infantry, and, discipline, with, the, eastern, exotic, use, of, war, elephants, that, relied, merely, on, fear, to, defeat, their, enemy, one, writer, commented, that, war, elephants, have, been, found, to, be, skittish, and, easily, alarmed, by, unfamiliar, sounds, and, for, this, reason, they, were, found, prone, to, break, ranks, and, flee, nonetheless, the, continued, use, of, war, elephants, for, several, thousand, years, attests, to, their, enduring, value, to, the, historical, battlefield, commander, the, use, of, war, elephants, over, the, centuries, has, left, a, deep, cultural, legacy, in, many, countries, many, traditional, war, games, incorporate, war, elephants, there, is, piece, in, chess, called, elephant, while, englishmen, call, that, piece, bishop, it, is, called, gajam, in, sanskrit, in, malayalam, it, is, called, aana, meaning,
