canals, or, artificial, waterways, are, waterways, or, engineered, channels, built, for, drainage, management, e, g, flood, control, and, irrigation, or, for, conveyancing, water, transport, vehicles, e, g, water, taxi, they, carry, free, calm, surface, flow, under, atmospheric, pressure, and, can, be, thought, of, as, artificial, rivers, in, most, cases, a, canal, has, a, series, of, dams, and, locks, that, create, reservoirs, of, low, speed, current, flow, these, reservoirs, are, referred, to, as, slack, water, levels, often, just, called, levels, a, canal, can, be, called, a, navigation, canal, when, it, parallels, a, natural, river, and, shares, part, of, the, latter, s, discharges, and, drainage, basin, and, leverages, its, resources, by, building, dams, and, locks, to, increase, and, lengthen, its, stretches, of, slack, water, levels, while, staying, in, its, valley, a, canal, can, cut, across, a, drainage, divide, atop, a, ridge, generally, requiring, an, external, water, source, above, the, highest, elevation, the, best, known, example, of, such, a, canal, is, the, panama, canal, many, canals, have, been, built, at, elevations, above, valleys, and, other, waterways, canals, with, sources, of, water, at, a, higher, level, can, deliver, water, to, a, destination, such, as, a, city, where, water, is, needed, the, roman, empire, s, aqueducts, were, such, water, supply, canals, the, term, was, once, used, to, describe, linear, features, seen, on, the, surface, of, mars, martian, canals, an, optical, illusion, a, navigation, is, a, series, of, channels, that, run, roughly, parallel, to, the, valley, and, stream, bed, of, an, unimproved, river, a, navigation, always, shares, the, drainage, basin, of, the, river, a, vessel, uses, the, calm, parts, of, the, river, itself, as, well, as, improvements, traversing, the, same, changes, in, height, a, true, canal, is, a, channel, that, cuts, across, a, drainage, divide, making, a, navigable, channel, connecting, two, different, drainage, basins, both, navigations, and, canals, use, engineered, structures, to, improve, navigation, since, they, cut, across, drainage, divides, canals, are, more, difficult, to, construct, and, often, need, additional, improvements, like, viaducts, and, aqueducts, to, bridge, waters, over, streams, and, roads, and, ways, to, keep, water, in, the, channel, there, are, two, broad, types, of, canal, historically, canals, were, of, immense, importance, to, commerce, and, the, development, growth, and, vitality, of, a, civilization, in, 1855, the, lehigh, canal, carried, over, 1, 2, million, tons, of, anthracite, coal, by, the, 1930s, the, company, which, built, and, operated, it, for, over, a, century, ceased, operation, the, few, canals, still, in, operation, in, our, modern, age, are, a, fraction, of, the, numbers, that, once, fueled, and, enabled, economic, growth, indeed, were, practically, a, prerequisite, to, further, urbanization, and, industrialization, for, the, movement, of, bulk, raw, materials, such, as, coal, and, ores, are, difficult, and, marginally, affordable, without, water, transport, such, raw, materials, fueled, the, industrial, developments, and, new, metallurgy, resulting, of, the, spiral, of, increasing, mechanization, during, 17th, 20th, century, leading, to, new, research, disciplines, new, industries, and, economies, of, scale, raising, the, standard, of, living, for, any, industrialized, society, most, ship, canals, today, primarily, service, bulk, cargo, and, large, ship, transportation, industries, whereas, the, once, critical, smaller, inland, waterways, conceived, and, engineered, as, boat, and, barge, canals, have, largely, been, supplanted, and, filled, in, abandoned, and, left, to, deteriorate, or, kept, in, service, and, staffed, by, state, employees, where, dams, and, locks, are, maintained, for, flood, control, or, pleasure, boating, their, replacement, was, gradual, beginning, first, in, the, united, states, in, the, mid, 1850s, where, canal, shipping, was, first, augmented, by, then, began, being, replaced, by, using, much, faster, less, geographically, constrained, limited, and, generally, cheaper, to, maintain, railways, by, the, early, 1880s, canals, which, had, little, ability, to, economically, compete, with, rail, transport, were, off, the, map, in, the, next, couple, of, decades, coal, was, increasingly, diminished, as, the, heating, fuel, of, choice, by, oil, and, growth, of, coal, shipments, leveled, off, later, after, world, war, i, when, motor, trucks, came, into, their, own, the, last, small, u, s, barge, canals, saw, a, steady, decline, in, cargo, ton, miles, alongside, many, railways, the, flexibility, and, steep, slope, climbing, capability, of, lorries, taking, over, cargo, hauling, increasingly, as, road, networks, were, improved, and, which, also, had, the, freedom, to, make, deliveries, well, away, from, rail, lined, road, beds, or, ditches, in, the, dirt, which, could, not, operate, in, the, winter, the, longest, extant, canal, today, the, grand, canal, in, northern, china, still, remains, in, heavy, use, especially, the, portion, south, of, the, yellow, river, it, stretches, from, beijing, to, hangzhou, at, 1, 794, kilometres, 1, 115, miles, canals, are, built, in, one, of, three, ways, or, a, combination, of, the, three, depending, on, available, water, and, available, path, smaller, transportation, canals, can, carry, barges, or, narrowboats, while, ship, canals, allow, seagoing, ships, to, travel, to, an, inland, port, e, g, manchester, ship, canal, or, from, one, sea, or, ocean, to, another, e, g, caledonian, canal, panama, canal, at, their, simplest, canals, consist, of, a, trench, filled, with, water, depending, on, the, stratum, the, canal, passes, through, it, may, be, necessary, to, line, the, cut, with, some, form, of, watertight, material, such, as, clay, or, concrete, when, this, is, done, with, clay, it, is, known, as, puddling, canals, need, to, be, level, and, while, small, irregularities, in, the, lie, of, the, land, can, be, dealt, with, through, cuttings, and, embankments, for, larger, deviations, other, approaches, have, been, adopted, the, most, common, is, the, pound, lock, which, consists, of, a, chamber, within, which, the, water, level, can, be, raised, or, lowered, connecting, either, two, pieces, of, canal, at, a, different, level, or, the, canal, with, a, river, or, the, sea, when, there, is, a, hill, to, be, climbed, flights, of, many, locks, in, short, succession, may, be, used, prior, to, the, development, of, the, pound, lock, in, 984, ad, in, china, by, chhaio, wei, yo, and, later, in, europe, in, the, 15th, century, either, flash, locks, consisting, of, a, single, gate, were, used, or, ramps, sometimes, equipped, with, rollers, were, used, to, change, the, level, flash, locks, were, only, practical, where, there, was, plenty, of, water, available, locks, use, a, lot, of, water, so, builders, have, adopted, other, approaches, for, situations, where, little, water, is, available, these, include, boat, lifts, such, as, the, falkirk, wheel, which, use, a, caisson, of, water, in, which, boats, float, while, being, moved, between, two, levels, and, inclined, planes, where, a, caisson, is, hauled, up, a, steep, railway, to, cross, a, stream, road, or, valley, where, the, delay, caused, by, a, flight, of, locks, at, either, side, would, be, unacceptable, the, valley, can, be, spanned, by, a, navigable, aqueduct, a, famous, example, in, wales, is, the, pontcysyllte, aqueduct, now, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, across, the, valley, of, the, river, dee, another, option, for, dealing, with, hills, is, to, tunnel, through, them, an, example, of, this, approach, is, the, harecastle, tunnel, on, the, trent, and, mersey, canal, tunnels, are, only, practical, for, smaller, canals, some, canals, attempted, to, keep, changes, in, level, down, to, a, minimum, these, canals, known, as, contour, canals, would, take, longer, winding, routes, along, which, the, land, was, a, uniform, altitude, other, generally, later, canals, took, more, direct, routes, requiring, the, use, of, various, methods, to, deal, with, the, change, in, level, canals, have, various, features, to, tackle, the, problem, of, water, supply, in, cases, like, the, suez, canal, the, canal, is, open, to, the, sea, where, the, canal, is, not, at, sea, level, a, number, of, approaches, have, been, adopted, taking, water, from, existing, rivers, or, springs, was, an, option, in, some, cases, sometimes, supplemented, by, other, methods, to, deal, with, seasonal, variations, in, flow, where, such, sources, were, unavailable, reservoirs, either, separate, from, the, canal, or, built, into, its, course, and, back, pumping, were, used, to, provide, the, required, water, in, other, cases, water, pumped, from, mines, was, used, to, feed, the, canal, in, certain, cases, extensive, feeder, canals, were, built, to, bring, water, from, sources, located, far, from, the, canal, where, large, amounts, of, goods, are, loaded, or, unloaded, such, as, at, the, end, of, a, canal, a, canal, basin, may, be, built, this, would, normally, be, a, section, of, water, wider, than, the, general, canal, in, some, cases, the, canal, basins, contain, wharfs, and, cranes, to, assist, with, movement, of, goods, when, a, section, of, the, canal, needs, to, be, sealed, off, so, it, can, be, drained, for, maintenance, stop, planks, are, frequently, used, these, consist, of, planks, of, wood, placed, across, the, canal, to, form, a, dam, they, are, generally, placed, in, pre, existing, grooves, in, the, canal, bank, on, more, modern, canals, guard, locks, or, gates, were, sometimes, placed, to, allow, a, section, of, the, canal, to, be, quickly, closed, off, either, for, maintenance, or, to, prevent, a, major, loss, of, water, due, to, a, canal, breach, a, canal, fall, or, canal, drop, is, a, vertical, drop, in, the, canal, bed, these, are, built, when, the, natural, ground, slope, is, steeper, than, the, desired, canal, gradient, they, are, constructed, so, the, falling, water, s, kinetic, energy, is, dissipated, in, order, to, prevent, it, from, scouring, the, bed, and, sides, of, the, canal, 643, a, canal, fall, is, constructed, by, cut, and, fill, it, may, be, combined, with, a, regulator, bridge, or, other, structure, to, save, costs, 643, 4, there, are, various, types, of, canal, falls, based, on, their, shape, one, type, is, the, ogee, fall, where, the, drop, follows, an, s, shaped, curve, to, create, a, smooth, transition, and, reduce, turbulence, however, this, smooth, transition, does, not, dissipate, the, water, s, kinetic, energy, which, leads, to, heavy, scouring, as, a, result, the, canal, needs, to, be, reinforced, with, concrete, or, masonry, to, protect, it, from, eroding, 644, another, type, of, canal, fall, is, the, vertical, fall, which, is, simple, and, economical, these, feature, a, cistern, or, depressed, area, just, downstream, from, the, fall, to, cushion, the, water, by, providing, a, deep, pool, for, its, kinetic, energy, to, be, diffused, in, vertical, falls, work, for, drops, of, up, to, 1, 5, m, in, height, and, for, discharge, of, up, to, 15, cubic, meters, per, second, 646, the, transport, capacity, of, pack, animals, and, carts, is, limited, a, mule, can, carry, an, eighth, ton, maximum, load, over, a, journey, measured, in, days, and, weeks, though, much, more, for, shorter, distances, and, periods, with, appropriate, rest, besides, carts, need, roads, transport, over, water, is, much, more, efficient, and, cost, effective, for, large, cargoes, the, oldest, known, canals, were, irrigation, canals, built, in, mesopotamia, c, 4000, bc, in, what, is, now, iraq, the, indus, valley, civilization, of, ancient, india, c, 3000, bc, had, sophisticated, irrigation, and, storage, systems, developed, including, the, reservoirs, built, at, girnar, in, 3000, bc, this, is, the, first, time, that, such, planned, civil, project, had, taken, place, in, the, ancient, world, in, egypt, canals, date, back, at, least, to, the, time, of, pepi, i, meryre, reigned, 2332, 2283, bc, who, ordered, a, canal, built, to, bypass, the, cataract, on, the, nile, near, aswan, in, ancient, china, large, canals, for, river, transport, were, established, as, far, back, as, the, spring, and, autumn, period, 8th, 5th, centuries, bc, the, longest, one, of, that, period, being, the, hong, gou, canal, of, the, wild, geese, which, according, to, the, ancient, historian, sima, qian, connected, the, old, states, of, song, zhang, chen, cai, cao, and, wei, the, caoyun, system, of, canals, was, essential, for, imperial, taxation, which, was, largely, assessed, in, kind, and, involved, enormous, shipments, of, rice, and, other, grains, by, far, the, longest, canal, was, the, grand, canal, of, china, still, the, longest, canal, in, the, world, today, and, the, oldest, extant, one, it, is, 1, 794, kilometres, 1, 115, mi, long, and, was, built, to, carry, the, emperor, yang, guang, between, zhuodu, beijing, and, yuhang, hangzhou, the, project, began, in, 605, and, was, completed, in, 609, although, much, of, the, work, combined, older, canals, the, oldest, section, of, the, canal, existing, since, at, least, 486, bc, even, in, its, narrowest, urban, sections, it, is, rarely, less, than, 30, metres, 98, ft, wide, in, the, 5th, century, bc, achaemenid, king, xerxes, i, of, persia, ordered, the, construction, of, the, xerxes, canal, through, the, base, of, mount, athos, peninsula, chalkidiki, northern, greece, it, was, constructed, as, part, of, his, preparations, for, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, a, part, of, the, greco, persian, wars, it, is, one, of, the, few, monuments, left, by, the, persian, empire, in, europe, greek, engineers, were, also, among, the, first, to, use, canal, locks, by, which, they, regulated, the, water, flow, in, the, ancient, suez, canal, as, early, as, the, 3rd, century, bc, there, was, little, experience, moving, bulk, loads, by, carts, while, a, pack, horse, would, carry, only, an, eighth, of, a, ton, on, a, soft, road, a, horse, might, be, able, to, draw, 5, 8ths, of, a, ton, but, if, the, load, were, carried, by, a, barge, on, a, waterway, then, up, to, 30, tons, could, be, drawn, by, the, same, horse, technology, historian, ronald, w, clark, referring, to, transport, realities, before, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, canal, age, hohokam, was, a, society, in, the, north, american, southwest, in, what, is, now, part, of, arizona, united, states, and, sonora, mexico, their, irrigation, systems, supported, the, largest, population, in, the, southwest, by, 1300, ce, archaeologists, working, at, a, major, archaeological, dig, in, the, 1990s, in, the, tucson, basin, along, the, santa, cruz, river, identified, a, culture, and, people, that, may, have, been, the, ancestors, of, the, hohokam, this, prehistoric, group, occupied, southern, arizona, as, early, as, 2000, bce, and, in, the, early, agricultural, period, grew, corn, lived, year, round, in, sedentary, villages, and, developed, sophisticated, irrigation, canals, the, large, scale, hohokam, irrigation, network, in, the, phoenix, metropolitan, area, was, the, most, complex, in, ancient, north, america, a, portion, of, the, ancient, canals, has, been, renovated, for, the, salt, river, project, and, now, helps, to, supply, the, city, s, water, the, sinhalese, constructed, the, 87, km, 54, mi, yodha, ela, in, 459, a, d, as, a, part, of, their, extensive, irrigation, network, which, functioned, in, a, way, of, a, moving, reservoir, due, to, its, single, banking, aspect, to, manage, the, canal, pressure, with, the, influx, of, water, it, was, also, designed, as, an, elongated, reservoir, passing, through, traps, creating, 66, mini, catchments, as, it, flows, from, kala, wewa, to, thissa, wawa, the, canal, was, not, designed, for, the, quick, conveying, of, water, from, kala, wewa, to, thissa, wawa, but, to, create, a, mass, of, water, between, the, two, reservoirs, which, would, in, turn, provided, for, agriculture, and, the, use, of, humans, and, animals, they, also, achieved, a, rather, low, gradient, for, its, time, the, canal, is, still, in, use, after, renovation, in, the, middle, ages, water, transport, was, several, times, cheaper, and, faster, than, transport, overland, overland, transport, by, animal, drawn, conveyances, was, used, around, settled, areas, but, unimproved, roads, required, pack, animal, trains, usually, of, mules, to, carry, any, degree, of, mass, and, while, a, mule, could, carry, an, eighth, ton, it, also, needed, teamsters, to, tend, it, and, one, man, could, only, tend, perhaps, five, mules, meaning, overland, bulk, transport, was, also, expensive, as, men, expect, compensation, in, the, form, of, wages, room, and, board, this, was, because, long, haul, roads, were, unpaved, more, often, than, not, too, narrow, for, carts, much, less, wagons, and, in, poor, condition, wending, their, way, through, forests, marshy, or, muddy, quagmires, as, often, as, unimproved, but, dry, footing, in, that, era, as, today, greater, cargoes, especially, bulk, goods, and, raw, materials, could, be, transported, by, ship, far, more, economically, than, by, land, in, the, pre, railroad, days, of, the, industrial, revolution, water, transport, was, the, gold, standard, of, fast, transportation, the, first, artificial, canal, in, western, europe, was, the, fossa, carolina, built, at, the, end, of, the, 8th, century, under, personal, supervision, of, charlemagne, in, britain, the, glastonbury, canal, is, believed, to, be, the, first, post, roman, canal, and, was, built, in, the, middle, of, the, 10th, century, to, link, the, river, brue, at, northover, with, glastonbury, abbey, a, distance, of, about, 1, 75, kilometres, 1, 900, yd, its, initial, purpose, is, believed, to, be, the, transport, of, building, stone, for, the, abbey, but, later, it, was, used, for, delivering, produce, including, grain, wine, and, fish, from, the, abbey, s, outlying, properties, it, remained, in, use, until, at, least, the, 14th, century, but, possibly, as, late, as, the, mid, 16th, century, more, lasting, and, of, more, economic, impact, were, canals, like, the, naviglio, grande, built, between, 1127, and, 1257, to, connect, milan, with, the, river, ticino, the, naviglio, grande, is, the, most, important, of, the, lombard, navigli, and, the, oldest, functioning, canal, in, europe, later, canals, were, built, in, the, netherlands, and, flanders, to, drain, the, polders, and, assist, transportation, of, goods, and, people, canal, building, was, revived, in, this, age, because, of, commercial, expansion, from, the, 12th, century, river, navigations, were, improved, progressively, by, the, use, of, single, or, flash, locks, taking, boats, through, these, used, large, amounts, of, water, leading, to, conflicts, with, watermill, owners, and, to, correct, this, the, pound, or, chamber, lock, first, appeared, in, the, 10th, century, in, china, and, in, europe, in, 1373, in, vreeswijk, netherlands, another, important, development, was, the, mitre, gate, which, was, it, is, presumed, introduced, in, italy, by, bertola, da, novate, in, the, 16th, century, this, allowed, wider, gates, and, also, removed, the, height, restriction, of, guillotine, locks, to, break, out, of, the, limitations, caused, by, river, valleys, the, first, summit, level, canals, were, developed, with, the, grand, canal, of, china, in, 581, 617, ad, whilst, in, europe, the, first, also, using, single, locks, was, the, stecknitz, canal, in, germany, in, 1398, in, the, songhai, empire, of, west, africa, several, canals, were, constructed, under, sunni, ali, and, askia, muhammad, i, between, kabara, and, timbuktu, in, the, 15th, century, these, were, used, primarily, for, irrigation, and, transport, sunni, ali, also, attempted, to, construct, a, canal, from, the, niger, river, to, walata, to, facilitate, conquest, of, the, city, but, his, progress, was, halted, when, he, went, to, war, with, the, mossi, kingdoms, around, 1500, 1800, the, first, summit, level, canal, to, use, pound, locks, in, europe, was, the, briare, canal, connecting, the, loire, and, seine, 1642, followed, by, the, more, ambitious, canal, du, midi, 1683, connecting, the, atlantic, to, the, mediterranean, this, included, a, staircase, of, 8, locks, at, b, ziers, a, 157, metres, 515, ft, tunnel, and, three, major, aqueducts, canal, building, progressed, steadily, in, germany, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, with, three, great, rivers, the, elbe, oder, and, weser, being, linked, by, canals, in, post, roman, britain, the, first, early, modern, period, canal, built, appears, to, have, been, the, exeter, canal, which, was, surveyed, in, 1563, and, open, in, 1566, the, oldest, canal, in, the, european, settlements, of, north, america, technically, a, mill, race, built, for, industrial, purposes, is, mother, brook, between, the, boston, massachusetts, neighbourhoods, of, dedham, and, hyde, park, connecting, the, higher, waters, of, the, charles, river, and, the, mouth, of, the, neponset, river, and, the, sea, it, was, constructed, in, 1639, to, provide, water, power, for, mills, in, russia, the, volga, baltic, waterway, a, nationwide, canal, system, connecting, the, baltic, sea, and, caspian, sea, via, the, neva, and, volga, rivers, was, opened, in, 1718, the, modern, canal, system, was, mainly, a, product, of, the, 18th, century, and, early, 19th, century, it, came, into, being, because, the, industrial, revolution, which, began, in, britain, during, the, mid, 18th, century, demanded, an, economic, and, reliable, way, to, transport, goods, and, commodities, in, large, quantities, by, the, early, 18th, century, river, navigations, such, as, the, aire, and, calder, navigation, were, becoming, quite, sophisticated, with, pound, locks, and, longer, and, longer, cuts, some, with, intermediate, locks, to, avoid, circuitous, or, difficult, stretches, of, river, eventually, the, experience, of, building, long, multi, level, cuts, with, their, own, locks, gave, rise, to, the, idea, of, building, a, pure, canal, a, waterway, designed, on, the, basis, of, where, goods, needed, to, go, not, where, a, river, happened, to, be, the, claim, for, the, first, pure, canal, in, great, britain, is, debated, between, sankey, and, bridgewater, supporters, the, first, true, canal, in, what, is, now, the, united, kingdom, was, the, newry, canal, in, northern, ireland, constructed, by, thomas, steers, in, 1741, the, sankey, brook, navigation, which, connected, st, helens, with, the, river, mersey, is, often, claimed, as, the, first, modern, purely, artificial, canal, because, although, originally, a, scheme, to, make, the, sankey, brook, navigable, it, included, an, entirely, new, artificial, channel, that, was, effectively, a, canal, along, the, sankey, brook, valley, however, bridgewater, supporters, point, out, that, the, last, quarter, mile, of, the, navigation, is, indeed, a, canalized, stretch, of, the, brook, and, that, it, was, the, bridgewater, canal, less, obviously, associated, with, an, existing, river, that, captured, the, popular, imagination, and, inspired, further, canals, in, the, mid, eighteenth, century, the, 3rd, duke, of, bridgewater, who, owned, a, number, of, coal, mines, in, northern, england, wanted, a, reliable, way, to, transport, his, coal, to, the, rapidly, industrializing, city, of, manchester, he, commissioned, the, engineer, james, brindley, to, build, a, canal, for, that, purpose, brindley, s, design, included, an, aqueduct, carrying, the, canal, over, the, river, irwell, this, was, an, engineering, wonder, which, immediately, attracted, tourists, the, construction, of, this, canal, was, funded, entirely, by, the, duke, and, was, called, the, bridgewater, canal, it, opened, in, 1761, and, was, the, first, major, british, canal, the, new, canals, proved, highly, successful, the, boats, on, the, canal, were, horse, drawn, with, a, towpath, alongside, the, canal, for, the, horse, to, walk, along, this, horse, drawn, system, proved, to, be, highly, economical, and, became, standard, across, the, british, canal, network, commercial, horse, drawn, canal, boats, could, be, seen, on, the, uk, s, canals, until, as, late, as, the, 1950s, although, by, then, diesel, powered, boats, often, towing, a, second, unpowered, boat, had, become, standard, the, canal, boats, could, carry, thirty, tons, at, a, time, with, only, one, horse, pulling, more, than, ten, times, the, amount, of, cargo, per, horse, that, was, possible, with, a, cart, because, of, this, huge, increase, in, supply, the, bridgewater, canal, reduced, the, price, of, coal, in, manchester, by, nearly, two, thirds, within, just, a, year, of, its, opening, the, bridgewater, was, also, a, huge, financial, success, with, it, earning, what, had, been, spent, on, its, construction, within, just, a, few, years, this, success, proved, the, viability, of, canal, transport, and, soon, industrialists, in, many, other, parts, of, the, country, wanted, canals, after, the, bridgewater, canal, early, canals, were, built, by, groups, of, private, individuals, with, an, interest, in, improving, communications, in, staffordshire, the, famous, potter, josiah, wedgwood, saw, an, opportunity, to, bring, bulky, cargoes, of, clay, to, his, factory, doors, and, to, transport, his, fragile, finished, goods, to, market, in, manchester, birmingham, or, further, away, by, water, minimizing, breakages, within, just, a, few, years, of, the, bridgewater, s, opening, an, embryonic, national, canal, network, came, into, being, with, the, construction, of, canals, such, as, the, oxford, canal, and, the, trent, mersey, canal, the, new, canal, system, was, both, cause, and, effect, of, the, rapid, industrialization, of, the, midlands, and, the, north, the, period, between, the, 1770s, and, the, 1830s, is, often, referred, to, as, the, golden, age, of, british, canals, for, each, canal, an, act, of, parliament, was, necessary, to, authorize, construction, and, as, people, saw, the, high, incomes, achieved, from, canal, tolls, canal, proposals, came, to, be, put, forward, by, investors, interested, in, profiting, from, dividends, at, least, as, much, as, by, people, whose, businesses, would, profit, from, cheaper, transport, of, raw, materials, and, finished, goods, in, a, further, development, there, was, often, out, and, out, speculation, where, people, would, try, to, buy, shares, in, a, newly, floated, company, to, sell, them, on, for, an, immediate, profit, regardless, of, whether, the, canal, was, ever, profitable, or, even, built, during, this, period, of, canal, mania, huge, sums, were, invested, in, canal, building, and, although, many, schemes, came, to, nothing, the, canal, system, rapidly, expanded, to, nearly, 4, 000, miles, over, 6, 400, kilometres, in, length, many, rival, canal, companies, were, formed, and, competition, was, rampant, perhaps, the, best, example, was, worcester, bar, in, birmingham, a, point, where, the, worcester, and, birmingham, canal, and, the, birmingham, canal, navigations, main, line, were, only, seven, feet, apart, for, many, years, a, dispute, about, tolls, meant, that, goods, travelling, through, birmingham, had, to, be, portaged, from, boats, in, one, canal, to, boats, in, the, other, canal, companies, were, initially, chartered, by, individual, states, in, the, united, states, these, early, canals, were, constructed, owned, and, operated, by, private, joint, stock, companies, four, were, completed, when, the, war, of, 1812, broke, out, these, were, the, south, hadley, canal, opened, 1795, in, massachusetts, santee, canal, opened, 1800, in, south, carolina, the, middlesex, canal, opened, 1802, also, in, massachusetts, and, the, dismal, swamp, canal, opened, 1805, in, virginia, the, erie, canal, opened, 1825, was, chartered, and, owned, by, the, state, of, new, york, and, financed, by, bonds, bought, by, private, investors, the, erie, canal, runs, about, 363, miles, 584, km, from, albany, new, york, on, the, hudson, river, to, buffalo, new, york, at, lake, erie, the, hudson, river, connects, albany, to, the, atlantic, port, of, new, york, city, and, the, erie, canal, completed, a, navigable, water, route, from, the, atlantic, ocean, to, the, great, lakes, the, canal, contains, 36, locks, and, encompasses, a, total, elevation, differential, of, around, 565, ft, 169, m, the, erie, canal, with, its, easy, connections, to, most, of, the, u, s, mid, west, and, new, york, city, soon, quickly, paid, back, all, its, invested, capital, us, 7, million, and, started, turning, a, profit, by, cutting, transportation, costs, in, half, or, more, it, became, a, large, profit, center, for, albany, and, new, york, city, as, it, allowed, the, cheap, transportation, of, many, of, the, agricultural, products, grown, in, the, mid, west, of, the, united, states, to, the, rest, of, the, world, from, new, york, city, these, agricultural, products, could, easily, be, shipped, to, other, u, s, states, or, overseas, assured, of, a, market, for, their, farm, products, the, settlement, of, the, u, s, mid, west, was, greatly, accelerated, by, the, erie, canal, the, profits, generated, by, the, erie, canal, project, started, a, canal, building, boom, in, the, united, states, that, lasted, until, about, 1850, when, railroads, started, becoming, seriously, competitive, in, price, and, convenience, the, blackstone, canal, finished, in, 1828, in, massachusetts, and, rhode, island, fulfilled, a, similar, role, in, the, early, industrial, revolution, between, 1828, and, 1848, the, blackstone, valley, was, a, major, contributor, of, the, american, industrial, revolution, where, samuel, slater, built, his, first, textile, mill, a, power, canal, refers, to, a, canal, used, for, hydraulic, power, generation, rather, than, for, transport, nowadays, power, canals, are, built, almost, exclusively, as, parts, of, hydroelectric, power, stations, parts, of, the, united, states, particularly, in, the, northeast, had, enough, fast, flowing, rivers, that, water, power, was, the, primary, means, of, powering, factories, usually, textile, mills, until, after, the, american, civil, war, for, example, lowell, massachusetts, considered, to, be, the, cradle, of, the, american, industrial, revolution, has, 6, miles, 9, 7, km, of, canals, built, from, around, 1790, to, 1850, that, provided, water, power, and, a, means, of, transportation, for, the, city, the, output, of, the, system, is, estimated, at, 10, 000, horsepower, other, cities, with, extensive, power, canal, systems, include, lawrence, massachusetts, holyoke, massachusetts, manchester, new, hampshire, and, augusta, georgia, the, most, notable, power, canal, was, built, in, 1862, for, the, niagara, falls, hydraulic, power, and, manufacturing, company, competition, from, railways, from, the, 1830s, and, roads, in, the, 20th, century, made, the, smaller, canals, obsolete, for, most, commercial, transport, and, many, of, the, british, canals, fell, into, decay, only, the, manchester, ship, canal, and, the, aire, and, calder, canal, bucked, this, trend, yet, in, other, countries, canals, grew, in, size, as, construction, techniques, improved, during, the, 19th, century, in, the, us, the, length, of, canals, grew, from, 100, miles, 161, km, to, over, 4, 000, with, a, complex, network, making, the, great, lakes, navigable, in, conjunction, with, canada, although, some, canals, were, later, drained, and, used, as, railroad, rights, of, way, in, the, united, states, navigable, canals, reached, into, isolated, areas, and, brought, them, in, touch, with, the, world, beyond, by, 1825, the, erie, canal, 363, miles, 584, km, long, with, 36, locks, opened, up, a, connection, from, the, populated, northeast, to, the, great, lakes, settlers, flooded, into, regions, serviced, by, such, canals, since, access, to, markets, was, available, the, erie, canal, as, well, as, other, canals, was, instrumental, in, lowering, the, differences, in, commodity, prices, between, these, various, markets, across, america, the, canals, caused, price, convergence, between, different, regions, because, of, their, reduction, in, transportation, costs, which, allowed, americans, to, ship, and, buy, goods, from, farther, distances, much, cheaper, ohio, built, many, miles, of, canal, indiana, had, working, canals, for, a, few, decades, and, the, illinois, and, michigan, canal, connected, the, great, lakes, to, the, mississippi, river, system, until, replaced, by, a, channelized, river, waterway, three, major, canals, with, very, different, purposes, were, built, in, what, is, now, canada, the, first, welland, canal, which, opened, in, 1829, between, lake, ontario, and, lake, erie, bypassing, niagara, falls, and, the, lachine, canal, 1825, which, allowed, ships, to, skirt, the, nearly, impassable, rapids, on, the, st, lawrence, river, at, montreal, were, built, for, commerce, the, rideau, canal, completed, in, 1832, connects, ottawa, on, the, ottawa, river, to, kingston, ontario, on, lake, ontario, the, rideau, canal, was, built, as, a, result, of, the, war, of, 1812, to, provide, military, transportation, between, the, british, colonies, of, upper, canada, and, lower, canada, as, an, alternative, to, part, of, the, st, lawrence, river, which, was, susceptible, to, blockade, by, the, united, states, in, france, a, steady, linking, of, all, the, river, systems, rhine, rh, ne, sa, ne, and, seine, and, the, north, sea, was, boosted, in, 1879, by, the, establishment, of, the, freycinet, gauge, which, specified, the, minimum, size, of, locks, canal, traffic, doubled, in, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, many, notable, sea, canals, were, completed, in, this, period, starting, with, the, suez, canal, 1869, which, carries, tonnage, many, times, that, of, most, other, canals, and, the, kiel, canal, 1897, though, the, panama, canal, was, not, opened, until, 1914, in, the, 19th, century, a, number, of, canals, were, built, in, japan, including, the, biwako, canal, and, the, tone, canal, these, canals, were, partially, built, with, the, help, of, engineers, from, the, netherlands, and, other, countries, a, major, question, was, how, to, connect, the, atlantic, and, the, pacific, with, a, canal, through, narrow, central, america, the, panama, railroad, opened, in, 1855, the, original, proposal, was, for, a, sea, level, canal, through, what, is, today, nicaragua, taking, advantage, of, the, relatively, large, lake, nicaragua, this, canal, has, never, been, built, in, part, because, of, political, instability, which, scared, off, potential, investors, it, remains, an, active, project, the, geography, has, not, changed, and, in, the, 2010s, chinese, involvement, was, developing, the, second, choice, for, a, central, american, canal, was, a, panama, canal, the, de, lessups, company, which, ran, the, suez, canal, first, attempted, to, build, a, panama, canal, in, the, 1880s, the, difficulty, of, the, terrain, and, weather, rain, encountered, caused, the, company, to, go, bankrupt, high, worker, mortality, from, disease, also, discouraged, further, investment, in, the, project, delessup, s, abandoned, excavating, equipment, sits, isolated, decaying, machines, today, tourist, attractions, twenty, years, later, an, expansionist, united, states, that, just, acquired, colonies, after, defeating, spain, in, the, 1898, spanish, american, war, and, whose, navy, became, more, important, decided, to, reactivate, the, project, the, united, states, and, colombia, did, not, reach, agreement, on, the, terms, of, a, canal, treaty, see, hay, herr, n, treaty, panama, which, did, not, have, and, still, does, not, have, a, land, connection, with, the, rest, of, colombia, was, already, thinking, of, independence, in, 1903, the, united, states, with, support, from, panamanians, who, expected, the, canal, to, provide, substantial, wages, revenues, and, markets, for, local, goods, and, services, took, panama, province, away, from, colombia, and, set, up, a, puppet, republic, panama, its, currency, the, balboa, a, name, that, suggests, the, country, began, as, a, way, to, get, from, one, hemisphere, to, the, other, was, a, replica, of, the, us, dollar, the, us, dollar, was, and, remains, legal, tender, used, as, currency, a, u, s, military, zone, the, canal, zone, 10, miles, 16, km, wide, with, u, s, military, stationed, there, bases, 2, tv, stations, channels, 8, and, 10, pxs, a, u, s, style, high, school, split, panama, in, half, the, canal, a, major, engineering, project, was, built, the, u, s, did, not, feel, that, conditions, were, stable, enough, to, withdraw, until, 1979, the, withdrawal, from, panama, contributed, to, president, jimmy, carter, s, defeat, in, 1980, large, scale, ship, canals, such, as, the, panama, canal, and, suez, canal, continue, to, operate, for, cargo, transportation, as, do, european, barge, canals, due, to, globalization, they, are, becoming, increasingly, important, resulting, in, expansion, projects, such, as, the, panama, canal, expansion, project, the, expanded, canal, began, commercial, operation, on, 26, june, 2016, the, new, set, of, locks, allow, transit, of, larger, post, panamax, and, new, panamax, ships, the, narrow, early, industrial, canals, however, have, ceased, to, carry, significant, amounts, of, trade, and, many, have, been, abandoned, to, navigation, but, may, still, be, used, as, a, system, for, transportation, of, untreated, water, in, some, cases, railways, have, been, built, along, the, canal, route, an, example, being, the, croydon, canal, a, movement, that, began, in, britain, and, france, to, use, the, early, industrial, canals, for, pleasure, boats, such, as, hotel, barges, has, spurred, rehabilitation, of, stretches, of, historic, canals, in, some, cases, abandoned, canals, such, as, the, kennet, and, avon, canal, have, been, restored, and, are, now, used, by, pleasure, boaters, in, britain, canalside, housing, has, also, proven, popular, in, recent, years, the, seine, nord, europe, canal, is, being, developed, into, a, major, transportation, waterway, linking, france, with, belgium, germany, and, the, netherlands, canals, have, found, another, use, in, the, 21st, century, as, easements, for, the, installation, of, fibre, optic, telecommunications, network, cabling, avoiding, having, them, buried, in, roadways, while, facilitating, access, and, reducing, the, hazard, of, being, damaged, from, digging, equipment, canals, are, still, used, to, provide, water, for, agriculture, an, extensive, canal, system, exists, within, the, imperial, valley, in, the, southern, california, desert, to, provide, irrigation, to, agriculture, within, the, area, canals, are, so, deeply, identified, with, venice, that, many, canal, cities, have, been, nicknamed, the, venice, of, the, city, is, built, on, marshy, islands, with, wooden, piles, supporting, the, buildings, so, that, the, land, is, man, made, rather, than, the, waterways, the, islands, have, a, long, history, of, settlement, by, the, 12th, century, venice, was, a, powerful, city, state, amsterdam, was, built, in, a, similar, way, with, buildings, on, wooden, piles, it, became, a, city, around, 1300, many, amsterdam, canals, were, built, as, part, of, fortifications, they, became, grachten, when, the, city, was, enlarged, and, houses, were, built, alongside, the, water, its, nickname, as, the, venice, of, the, north, is, shared, with, hamburg, of, germany, st, petersburg, of, russia, and, bruges, of, belgium, suzhou, was, dubbed, the, venice, of, the, east, by, marco, polo, during, his, travels, there, in, the, 13th, century, with, its, modern, canalside, pingjiang, road, and, shantang, street, becoming, major, tourist, attractions, other, nearby, cities, including, nanjing, shanghai, wuxi, jiaxing, huzhou, nantong, taizhou, yangzhou, and, changzhou, are, located, along, the, lower, mouth, of, the, yangtze, river, and, lake, tai, yet, another, source, of, small, rivers, and, creeks, which, have, been, canalized, and, developed, for, centuries, other, cities, with, extensive, canal, networks, include, alkmaar, amersfoort, bolsward, brielle, delft, den, bosch, dokkum, dordrecht, enkhuizen, franeker, gouda, haarlem, harlingen, leeuwarden, leiden, sneek, and, utrecht, in, the, netherlands, brugge, and, gent, in, flanders, belgium, birmingham, in, england, saint, petersburg, in, russia,

c, n, th, in, vietnam, bangkok, in, thailand, and, lahore, in, pakistan, liverpool, maritime, mercantile, city, was, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, near, the, centre, of, liverpool, england, where, a, system, of, intertwining, waterways, and, docks, is, now, being, developed, for, mainly, residential, and, leisure, use, canal, estates, sometimes, known, as, bayous, in, the, united, states, are, a, form, of, subdivision, popular, in, cities, like, miami, florida, texas, city, texas, and, the, gold, coast, queensland, the, gold, coast, has, over, 890, km, of, residential, canals, wetlands, are, difficult, areas, upon, which, to, build, housing, estates, so, dredging, part, of, the, wetland, down, to, a, navigable, channel, provides, fill, to, build, up, another, part, of, the, wetland, above, the, flood, level, for, houses, land, is, built, up, in, a, finger, pattern, that, provides, a, suburban, street, layout, of, waterfront, housing, blocks, inland, canals, have, often, had, boats, specifically, built, for, them, an, example, of, this, is, the, british, narrowboat, which, is, up, to, 72, feet, 21, 95, m, long, and, 7, feet, 2, 13, m, wide, and, was, primarily, built, for, british, midland, canals, in, this, case, the, limiting, factor, was, the, size, of, the, locks, this, is, also, the, limiting, factor, on, the, panama, canal, where, panamax, ships, were, limited, to, a, length, of, 289, 56, m, 950, ft, and, a, beam, of, 32, 31, m, 106, ft, until, 26, june, 2016, when, the, opening, of, larger, locks, allowed, for, the, passage, of, larger, new, panamax, ships, for, the, lockless, suez, canal, the, limiting, factor, for, suezmax, ships, is, generally, draft, which, is, limited, to, 16, m, 52, 5, ft, at, the, other, end, of, the, scale, tub, boat, canals, such, as, the, bude, canal, were, limited, to, boats, of, under, 10, tons, for, much, of, their, length, due, to, the, capacity, of, their, inclined, planes, or, boat, lifts, most, canals, have, a, limit, on, height, imposed, either, by, bridges, or, by, tunnels
