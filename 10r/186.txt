petroleum, or, crude, oil, also, referred, to, as, simply, oil, is, a, naturally, occurring, yellowish, black, liquid, mixture, of, mainly, hydrocarbons, and, is, found, in, geological, formations, the, name, petroleum, covers, both, naturally, occurring, unprocessed, crude, oil, and, petroleum, products, that, consist, of, refined, crude, oil, petroleum, is, primarily, recovered, by, oil, drilling, drilling, is, carried, out, after, studies, of, structural, geology, sedimentary, basin, analysis, and, reservoir, characterization, unconventional, reserves, such, as, oil, sands, and, oil, shale, exist, once, extracted, oil, is, refined, and, separated, most, easily, by, distillation, into, innumerable, products, for, direct, use, or, use, in, manufacturing, products, include, fuels, such, as, gasoline, petrol, diesel, kerosene, and, jet, fuel, asphalt, and, lubricants, chemical, reagents, used, to, make, plastics, solvents, textiles, refrigerants, paint, synthetic, rubber, fertilizers, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and, thousands, of, others, petroleum, is, used, in, manufacturing, a, vast, variety, of, materials, essential, for, modern, life, and, it, is, estimated, that, the, world, consumes, about, 100, million, barrels, 16, million, cubic, metres, each, day, petroleum, production, can, be, extremely, profitable, and, was, critical, to, global, economic, development, in, the, 20th, century, some, countries, known, as, petrostates, gained, significant, economic, and, international, power, over, their, control, of, oil, production, and, trade, petroleum, exploitation, can, be, damaging, to, the, environment, and, human, health, extraction, refining, and, burning, of, petroleum, fuels, all, release, large, quantities, of, greenhouse, gases, so, petroleum, is, one, of, the, major, contributors, to, climate, change, other, negative, environmental, effects, include, direct, releases, such, as, oil, spills, as, well, as, air, and, water, pollution, at, almost, all, stages, of, use, these, environmental, effects, have, direct, and, indirect, health, consequences, for, humans, oil, has, also, been, a, source, of, internal, and, inter, state, conflict, leading, to, both, state, led, wars, and, other, resource, conflicts, production, of, petroleum, is, estimated, to, reach, peak, oil, before, 2035, as, global, economies, lower, dependencies, on, petroleum, as, part, of, climate, change, mitigation, and, a, transition, towards, renewable, energy, and, electrification, oil, has, played, a, key, role, in, industrialization, and, economic, development, the, word, petroleum, comes, from, medieval, latin, petroleum, literally, rock, oil, which, comes, from, latin, petra, rock, from, greek, p, tra, and, oleum, oil, from, greek, laion, the, origin, of, the, term, stems, from, monasteries, in, southern, italy, where, it, was, in, use, by, the, end, of, the, first, millennium, as, an, alternative, for, the, older, term, naphtha, after, that, the, term, was, used, in, numerous, manuscripts, and, books, such, as, in, the, treatise, de, natura, fossilium, published, in, 1546, by, the, german, mineralogist, georg, bauer, also, known, as, georgius, agricola, after, the, advent, of, the, oil, industry, during, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, term, became, commonly, known, for, the, liquid, form, of, hydrocarbons, petroleum, in, one, form, or, another, has, been, used, since, ancient, times, more, than, 4300, years, ago, bitumen, was, mentioned, when, the, sumerians, used, it, to, make, boats, a, tablet, of, the, legend, of, the, birth, of, sargon, of, akkad, mentions, a, basket, which, was, closed, by, straw, and, bitumen, more, than, 4000, years, ago, according, to, herodotus, and, diodorus, siculus, asphalt, was, used, in, the, construction, of, the, walls, and, towers, of, babylon, there, were, oil, pits, near, ardericca, and, babylon, and, a, pitch, spring, on, zakynthos, great, quantities, of, it, were, found, on, the, banks, of, the, river, issus, one, of, the, tributaries, of, the, euphrates, ancient, persian, tablets, indicate, the, medicinal, and, lighting, uses, of, petroleum, in, the, upper, levels, of, their, society, the, use, of, petroleum, in, ancient, china, dates, back, to, more, than, 2000, years, ago, the, i, ching, one, of, the, earliest, chinese, writings, cites, that, oil, in, its, raw, state, without, refining, was, first, discovered, extracted, and, used, in, china, in, the, first, century, bce, in, addition, the, chinese, were, the, first, to, record, the, use, of, petroleum, as, fuel, as, early, as, the, fourth, century, bce, by, 347, ce, oil, was, produced, from, bamboo, drilled, wells, in, china, in, the, 7th, century, petroleum, was, among, the, essential, ingredients, for, greek, fire, an, incendiary, projectile, weapon, that, was, used, by, byzantine, greeks, against, arab, ships, which, were, then, attacking, constantinople, crude, oil, was, also, distilled, by, persian, chemists, with, clear, descriptions, given, in, arabic, handbooks, such, as, those, of, abu, bakr, al, razi, rhazes, the, streets, of, baghdad, were, paved, with, tar, derived, from, petroleum, that, became, accessible, from, natural, fields, in, the, region, in, the, 9th, century, oil, fields, were, exploited, in, the, area, around, modern, baku, azerbaijan, these, fields, were, described, by, the, arab, geographer, abu, bakr, al, razi, in, the, 10th, century, and, by, marco, polo, in, the, 13th, century, who, described, the, output, of, those, wells, as, hundreds, of, shiploads, arab, and, persian, chemists, also, distilled, crude, oil, to, produce, flammable, products, for, military, purposes, through, islamic, spain, distillation, became, available, in, western, europe, by, the, 12th, century, it, has, also, been, present, in, romania, since, the, 13th, century, being, recorded, as, p, cur, sophisticated, oil, pits, 4, 5, to, 6, metres, 15, to, 20, ft, deep, were, dug, by, the, seneca, people, and, other, iroquois, in, western, pennsylvania, as, early, as, 1415, 1450, the, french, general, louis, joseph, de, montcalm, encountered, seneca, using, petroleum, for, ceremonial, fires, and, as, a, healing, lotion, during, a, visit, to, fort, duquesne, in, 1750, early, british, explorers, to, myanmar, documented, a, flourishing, oil, extraction, industry, based, in, yenangyaung, that, in, 1795, had, hundreds, of, hand, dug, wells, under, production, merkwiller, pechelbronn, is, said, to, be, the, first, european, site, where, petroleum, has, been, explored, and, used, the, still, active, erdpechquelle, a, spring, where, petroleum, appears, mixed, with, water, has, been, used, since, 1498, notably, for, medical, purposes, there, was, activity, in, various, parts, of, the, world, in, the, mid, 19th, century, a, group, directed, by, major, alexeyev, of, the, bakinskii, corps, of, mining, engineers, hand, drilled, a, well, in, the, baku, region, of, bibi, heybat, in, 1846, there, were, engine, drilled, wells, in, west, virginia, in, the, same, year, as, drake, s, well, an, early, commercial, well, was, hand, dug, in, poland, in, 1853, and, another, in, nearby, romania, in, 1857, at, around, the, same, time, the, world, s, first, small, oil, refinery, was, opened, at, jas, o, in, poland, then, austria, with, a, larger, one, opened, at, ploie, ti, in, romania, then, ottoman, empire, shortly, after, romania, then, being, a, part, of, the, ottoman, empire, is, the, first, country, in, the, world, to, have, had, its, annual, crude, oil, output, officially, recorded, in, international, statistics, 275, tonnes, for, 1857, in, 1858, georg, christian, konrad, hun, us, found, a, significant, amount, of, petroleum, while, drilling, for, lignite, in, wietze, germany, wietze, later, provided, about, 80, of, german, consumption, in, the, wilhelminian, era, the, production, stopped, in, 1963, but, wietze, has, hosted, a, petroleum, museum, since, 1970, oil, sands, have, been, mined, since, the, 18th, century, in, wietze, in, lower, saxony, natural, asphalt, bitumen, has, been, explored, since, the, 18th, century, both, in, pechelbronn, as, in, wietze, the, coal, industry, dominated, the, petroleum, technologies, chemist, james, young, in, 1847, noticed, a, natural, petroleum, seepage, in, the, coal, mine, at, riddings, alfreton, derbyshire, from, which, he, distilled, a, light, thin, oil, suitable, for, use, as, lamp, oil, at, the, same, time, obtaining, a, more, viscous, oil, suitable, for, lubricating, machinery, in, 1848, young, set, up, a, small, business, refining, crude, oil, young, eventually, succeeded, by, distilling, cannel, coal, at, low, heat, in, creating, a, fluid, resembling, petroleum, which, when, treated, in, the, same, way, as, the, seep, oil, gave, similar, products, young, found, that, by, slow, distillation, he, could, obtain, several, useful, liquids, from, it, one, of, which, he, named, paraffine, oil, because, at, low, temperatures, it, congealed, into, a, substance, resembling, paraffin, wax, the, production, of, these, oils, and, solid, paraffin, wax, from, coal, formed, the, subject, of, his, patent, dated, october, 17, 1850, in, 1850, young, meldrum, and, edward, william, binney, entered, into, partnership, under, the, title, of, e, w, binney, co, at, bathgate, in, west, lothian, and, e, meldrum, co, at, glasgow, their, works, at, bathgate, were, completed, in, 1851, and, became, the, first, truly, commercial, oil, works, in, the, world, with, the, first, modern, oil, refinery, the, world, s, first, oil, refinery, was, built, in, 1856, by, ignacy, ukasiewicz, in, austria, his, achievements, also, included, the, discovery, of, how, to, distill, kerosene, from, seep, oil, the, invention, of, the, modern, kerosene, lamp, 1853, the, introduction, of, the, first, modern, street, lamp, in, europe, 1853, and, the, construction, of, the, world, s, first, modern, oil, mine, 1854, at, b, brka, near, krosno, still, operational, as, of, 2020, the, demand, for, petroleum, as, a, fuel, for, lighting, in, north, america, and, around, the, world, quickly, grew, the, first, oil, well, in, the, americas, was, drilled, in, 1859, by, edwin, drake, at, what, is, now, called, the, drake, well, in, cherrytree, township, pennsylvania, there, also, was, a, company, associated, with, it, and, it, sparked, a, major, oil, drilling, boom, the, first, commercial, oil, well, in, canada, became, operational, in, 1858, at, oil, springs, ontario, then, canada, west, businessman, james, miller, williams, dug, several, wells, between, 1855, and, 1858, before, discovering, a, rich, reserve, of, oil, four, metres, below, ground, williams, extracted, 1, 5, million, litres, of, crude, oil, by, 1860, refining, much, of, it, into, kerosene, lamp, oil, williams, s, well, became, commercially, viable, a, year, before, drake, s, pennsylvania, operation, and, could, be, argued, to, be, the, first, commercial, oil, well, in, north, america, the, discovery, at, oil, springs, touched, off, an, oil, boom, which, brought, hundreds, of, speculators, and, workers, to, the, area, advances, in, drilling, continued, into, 1862, when, local, driller, shaw, reached, a, depth, of, 62, metres, using, the, spring, pole, drilling, method, on, january, 16, 1862, after, an, explosion, of, natural, gas, canada, s, first, oil, gusher, came, into, production, shooting, into, the, air, at, a, recorded, rate, of, 480, cubic, metres, 3, 000, bbl, per, day, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, russian, empire, particularly, the, branobel, company, in, azerbaijan, had, taken, the, lead, in, production, access, to, oil, was, and, still, is, a, major, factor, in, several, military, conflicts, of, the, 20th, century, including, world, war, ii, during, which, oil, facilities, were, a, major, strategic, asset, and, were, extensively, bombed, the, german, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, included, the, goal, to, capture, the, baku, oilfields, as, it, would, provide, much, needed, oil, supplies, for, the, german, military, which, was, suffering, from, blockades, oil, exploration, in, north, america, during, the, early, 20th, century, later, led, to, the, u, s, becoming, the, leading, producer, by, mid, century, as, petroleum, production, in, the, u, s, peaked, during, the, 1960s, the, united, states, was, surpassed, by, saudi, arabia, and, the, soviet, union, in, total, output, in, 1973, saudi, arabia, and, other, arab, nations, imposed, an, oil, embargo, against, the, united, states, united, kingdom, japan, and, other, western, nations, which, supported, israel, in, the, yom, kippur, war, of, october, 1973, the, embargo, caused, an, oil, crisis, this, was, followed, by, the, 1979, oil, crisis, which, was, caused, by, a, drop, in, oil, production, in, the, wake, of, the, iranian, revolution, and, caused, oil, prices, to, more, than, double, the, two, oil, price, shocks, had, many, short, and, long, term, effects, on, global, politics, and, the, global, economy, they, led, to, sustained, reductions, in, demand, as, a, result, of, substitution, to, other, fuels, especially, coal, and, nuclear, and, improvements, in, energy, efficiency, facilitated, by, government, policies, high, oil, prices, also, induced, investment, in, oil, production, by, non, opec, countries, including, prudhoe, bay, in, alaska, the, north, sea, offshore, fields, of, the, united, kingdom, and, norway, the, cantarell, offshore, field, of, mexico, and, oil, sands, in, canada, about, 90, percent, of, vehicular, fuel, needs, are, met, by, oil, petroleum, also, makes, up, 40, percent, of, total, energy, consumption, in, the, united, states, but, is, responsible, for, only, one, percent, of, electricity, generation, petroleum, s, worth, as, a, portable, dense, energy, source, powering, the, vast, majority, of, vehicles, and, as, the, base, of, many, industrial, chemicals, makes, it, one, of, the, world, s, most, important, commodities, the, top, three, oil, producing, countries, as, of, 2018, are, the, united, states, russia, and, saudi, arabia, in, 2018, due, in, part, to, developments, in, hydraulic, fracturing, and, horizontal, drilling, the, united, states, became, the, world, s, largest, producer, about, 80, percent, of, the, world, s, readily, accessible, reserves, are, located, in, the, middle, east, with, 62, 5, percent, coming, from, the, arab, five, saudi, arabia, united, arab, emirates, iraq, qatar, and, kuwait, a, large, portion, of, the, world, s, total, oil, exists, as, unconventional, sources, such, as, bitumen, in, athabasca, oil, sands, and, extra, heavy, oil, in, the, orinoco, belt, while, significant, volumes, of, oil, are, extracted, from, oil, sands, particularly, in, canada, logistical, and, technical, hurdles, remain, as, oil, extraction, requires, large, amounts, of, heat, and, water, making, its, net, energy, content, quite, low, relative, to, conventional, crude, oil, thus, canada, s, oil, sands, are, not, expected, to, provide, more, than, a, few, million, barrels, per, day, in, the, foreseeable, future, petroleum, consists, of, a, variety, of, liquid, gaseous, and, solid, components, lighter, hydrocarbons, are, the, gases, methane, ethane, propane, and, butane, otherwise, the, bulk, of, the, liquid, and, solids, are, largely, heavier, organic, compounds, often, hydrocarbons, c, and, h, only, the, proportion, of, light, hydrocarbons, in, the, petroleum, mixture, varies, among, oil, fields, an, oil, well, produces, predominantly, crude, oil, because, the, pressure, is, lower, at, the, surface, than, underground, some, of, the, gas, will, come, out, of, solution, and, be, recovered, or, burned, as, associated, gas, or, solution, gas, a, gas, well, produces, predominantly, natural, gas, however, because, the, underground, temperature, is, higher, than, at, the, surface, the, gas, may, contain, heavier, hydrocarbons, such, as, pentane, hexane, and, heptane, natural, gas, condensate, often, shortened, to, condensate, condensate, resembles, gasoline, in, appearance, and, is, similar, in, composition, to, some, volatile, light, crude, oils, the, hydrocarbons, in, crude, oil, are, mostly, alkanes, cycloalkanes, and, various, aromatic, hydrocarbons, while, the, other, organic, compounds, contain, nitrogen, oxygen, and, sulfur, and, traces, of, metals, such, as, iron, nickel, copper, and, vanadium, many, oil, reservoirs, contain, live, bacteria, the, exact, molecular, composition, of, crude, oil, varies, widely, from, formation, to, formation, but, the, proportion, of, chemical, elements, varies, over, fairly, narrow, limits, as, follows, four, different, types, of, hydrocarbon, appear, in, crude, oil, the, relative, percentage, of, each, varies, from, oil, to, oil, determining, the, properties, of, each, oil, the, alkanes, from, pentane, c, 5, h, 12, to, octane, c, 8, h, 18, are, refined, into, gasoline, the, ones, from, nonane, c, 9, h, 20, to, hexadecane, c, 16, h, 34, into, diesel, fuel, kerosene, and, jet, fuel, alkanes, with, more, than, 16, carbon, atoms, can, be, refined, into, fuel, oil, and, lubricating, oil, at, the, heavier, end, of, the, range, paraffin, wax, is, an, alkane, with, approximately, 25, carbon, atoms, while, asphalt, has, 35, and, up, although, these, are, usually, cracked, in, modern, refineries, into, more, valuable, products, the, lightest, fraction, the, so, called, petroleum, gases, are, subjected, to, diverse, processing, depending, on, cost, these, gases, are, either, flared, off, sold, as, liquefied, petroleum, gas, or, used, to, power, the, refinery, s, own, burners, during, the, winter, butane, c, 4, h, 10, is, blended, into, the, gasoline, pool, at, high, rates, because, its, high, vapour, pressure, assists, with, cold, starts, the, aromatic, hydrocarbons, are, unsaturated, hydrocarbons, that, have, one, or, more, benzene, rings, they, tend, to, burn, with, a, sooty, flame, and, many, have, a, sweet, aroma, some, are, carcinogenic, these, different, components, are, separated, by, fractional, distillation, at, an, oil, refinery, to, produce, gasoline, jet, fuel, kerosene, and, other, hydrocarbon, fractions, the, components, in, an, oil, sample, can, be, determined, by, gas, chromatography, and, mass, spectrometry, due, to, the, large, number, of, co, eluted, hydrocarbons, within, oil, many, cannot, be, resolved, by, traditional, gas, chromatography, this, unresolved, complex, mixture, ucm, of, hydrocarbons, is, particularly, apparent, when, analysing, weathered, oils, and, extracts, from, tissues, of, organisms, exposed, to, oil, crude, oil, varies, greatly, in, appearance, depending, on, its, composition, it, is, usually, black, or, dark, brown, although, it, may, be, yellowish, reddish, or, even, greenish, in, the, reservoir, it, is, usually, found, in, association, with, natural, gas, which, being, lighter, forms, a, gas, cap, over, the, petroleum, and, saline, water, which, being, heavier, than, most, forms, of, crude, oil, generally, sinks, beneath, it, crude, oil, may, also, be, found, in, a, semi, solid, form, mixed, with, sand, and, water, as, in, the, athabasca, oil, sands, in, canada, where, it, is, usually, referred, to, as, crude, bitumen, in, canada, bitumen, is, considered, a, sticky, black, tar, like, form, of, crude, oil, which, is, so, thick, and, heavy, that, it, must, be, heated, or, diluted, before, it, will, flow, venezuela, also, has, large, amounts, of, oil, in, the, orinoco, oil, sands, although, the, hydrocarbons, trapped, in, them, are, more, fluid, than, in, canada, and, are, usually, called, extra, heavy, oil, these, oil, sands, resources, are, called, unconventional, oil, to, distinguish, them, from, oil, which, can, be, extracted, using, traditional, oil, well, methods, between, them, canada, and, venezuela, contain, an, estimated, 3, 6, trillion, barrels, 570, 10, 9, m, 3, of, bitumen, and, extra, heavy, oil, about, twice, the, volume, of, the, world, s, reserves, of, conventional, oil, petroleum, is, a, fossil, fuel, derived, from, fossilized, organic, materials, such, as, zooplankton, and, algae, vast, amounts, of, these, remains, settled, to, sea, or, lake, bottoms, where, they, were, covered, in, stagnant, water, water, with, no, dissolved, oxygen, or, sediments, such, as, mud, and, silt, faster, than, they, could, decompose, aerobically, approximately, 1, m, below, this, sediment, water, oxygen, concentration, was, low, below, 0, 1, mg, l, and, anoxic, conditions, existed, temperatures, also, remained, constant, as, further, layers, settled, into, the, sea, or, lake, bed, intense, heat, and, pressure, built, up, in, the, lower, regions, this, process, caused, the, organic, matter, to, change, first, into, a, waxy, material, known, as, kerogen, found, in, various, oil, shales, around, the, world, and, then, with, more, heat, into, liquid, and, gaseous, hydrocarbons, via, a, process, known, as, catagenesis, formation, of, petroleum, occurs, from, hydrocarbon, pyrolysis, in, a, variety, of, mainly, endothermic, reactions, at, high, temperatures, or, pressures, or, both, these, phases, are, described, in, detail, below, in, the, absence, of, plentiful, oxygen, aerobic, bacteria, were, prevented, from, decaying, the, organic, matter, after, it, was, buried, under, a, layer, of, sediment, or, water, however, anaerobic, bacteria, were, able, to, reduce, sulfates, and, nitrates, among, the, matter, to, h, 2, s, and, n, 2, respectively, by, using, the, matter, as, a, source, for, other, reactants, due, to, such, anaerobic, bacteria, at, first, this, matter, began, to, break, apart, mostly, via, hydrolysis, polysaccharides, and, proteins, were, hydrolyzed, to, simple, sugars, and, amino, acids, respectively, these, were, further, anaerobically, oxidized, at, an, accelerated, rate, by, the, enzymes, of, the, bacteria, e, g, amino, acids, went, through, oxidative, deamination, to, imino, acids, which, in, turn, reacted, further, to, ammonia, and, keto, acids, monosaccharides, in, turn, ultimately, decayed, to, co, 2, and, methane, the, anaerobic, decay, products, of, amino, acids, monosaccharides, phenols, and, aldehydes, combined, into, fulvic, acids, fats, and, waxes, were, not, extensively, hydrolyzed, under, these, mild, conditions, some, phenolic, compounds, produced, from, previous, reactions, worked, as, bactericides, and, the, actinomycetales, order, of, bacteria, also, produced, antibiotic, compounds, e, g, streptomycin, thus, the, action, of, anaerobic, bacteria, ceased, at, about, 10, m, below, the, water, or, sediment, the, mixture, at, this, depth, contained, fulvic, acids, unreacted, and, partially, reacted, fats, and, waxes, slightly, modified, lignin, resins, and, other, hydrocarbons, as, more, layers, of, organic, matter, settled, into, the, sea, or, lake, bed, intense, heat, and, pressure, built, up, in, the, lower, regions, as, a, consequence, compounds, of, this, mixture, began, to, combine, in, poorly, understood, ways, to, kerogen, combination, happened, in, a, similar, fashion, as, phenol, and, formaldehyde, molecules, react, to, urea, formaldehyde, resins, but, kerogen, formation, occurred, in, a, more, complex, manner, due, to, a, bigger, variety, of, reactants, the, total, process, of, kerogen, formation, from, the, beginning, of, anaerobic, decay, is, called, diagenesis, a, word, that, means, a, transformation, of, materials, by, dissolution, and, recombination, of, their, constituents, kerogen, formation, continued, to, a, depth, of, about, 1, km, from, the, earth, s, surface, where, temperatures, may, reach, around, 50, c, kerogen, formation, represents, a, halfway, point, between, organic, matter, and, fossil, fuels, kerogen, can, be, exposed, to, oxygen, oxidize, and, thus, be, lost, or, it, could, be, buried, deeper, inside, the, earth, s, crust, and, be, subjected, to, conditions, which, allow, it, to, slowly, transform, into, fossil, fuels, like, petroleum, the, latter, happened, through, catagenesis, in, which, the, reactions, were, mostly, radical, rearrangements, of, kerogen, these, reactions, took, thousands, to, millions, of, years, and, no, external, reactants, were, involved, due, to, the, radical, nature, of, these, reactions, kerogen, reacted, towards, two, classes, of, products, those, with, low, h, c, ratio, anthracene, or, products, similar, to, it, and, those, with, high, h, c, ratio, methane, or, products, similar, to, it, i, e, carbon, rich, or, hydrogen, rich, products, because, catagenesis, was, closed, off, from, external, reactants, the, resulting, composition, of, the, fuel, mixture, was, dependent, on, the, composition, of, the, kerogen, via, reaction, stoichiometry, three, types, of, kerogen, exist, type, i, algal, ii, liptinic, and, iii, humic, which, were, formed, mainly, from, algae, plankton, and, woody, plants, this, term, includes, trees, shrubs, and, lianas, respectively, catagenesis, was, pyrolytic, despite, the, fact, that, it, happened, at, relatively, low, temperatures, when, compared, to, commercial, pyrolysis, plants, of, 60, to, several, hundred, c, pyrolysis, was, possible, because, of, the, long, reaction, times, involved, heat, for, catagenesis, came, from, the, decomposition, of, radioactive, materials, of, the, crust, especially, 40, k, 232, th, 235, u, and, 238, u, the, heat, varied, with, geothermal, gradient, and, was, typically, 10, 30, c, per, km, of, depth, from, the, earth, s, surface, unusual, magma, intrusions, however, could, have, created, greater, localized, heating, geologists, often, refer, to, the, temperature, range, in, which, oil, forms, as, an, oil, window, below, the, minimum, temperature, oil, remains, trapped, in, the, form, of, kerogen, above, the, maximum, temperature, the, oil, is, converted, to, natural, gas, through, the, process, of, thermal, cracking, sometimes, oil, formed, at, extreme, depths, may, migrate, and, become, trapped, at, a, much, shallower, level, the, athabasca, oil, sands, are, one, example, of, this, an, alternative, mechanism, to, the, one, described, above, was, proposed, by, russian, scientists, in, the, mid, 1850s, the, hypothesis, of, abiogenic, petroleum, origin, petroleum, formed, by, inorganic, means, but, this, is, contradicted, by, geological, and, geochemical, evidence, abiogenic, sources, of, oil, have, been, found, but, never, in, commercially, profitable, amounts, the, controversy, isn, t, over, whether, abiogenic, oil, reserves, exist, said, larry, nation, of, the, american, association, of, petroleum, geologists, the, controversy, is, over, how, much, they, contribute, to, earth, s, overall, reserves, and, how, much, time, and, effort, geologists, should, devote, to, seeking, them, out, three, conditions, must, be, present, for, oil, reservoirs, to, form, the, reactions, that, produce, oil, and, natural, gas, are, often, modeled, as, first, order, breakdown, reactions, where, hydrocarbons, are, broken, down, to, oil, and, natural, gas, by, a, set, of, parallel, reactions, and, oil, eventually, breaks, down, to, natural, gas, by, another, set, of, reactions, the, latter, set, is, regularly, used, in, petrochemical, plants, and, oil, refineries, petroleum, has, mostly, been, recovered, by, oil, drilling, natural, petroleum, springs, are, rare, drilling, is, carried, out, after, studies, of, structural, geology, at, the, reservoir, scale, sedimentary, basin, analysis, and, reservoir, characterisation, mainly, in, terms, of, the, porosity, and, permeability, of, geologic, reservoir, structures, wells, are, drilled, into, oil, reservoirs, to, extract, the, crude, oil, natural, lift, production, methods, that, rely, on, the, natural, reservoir, pressure, to, force, the, oil, to, the, surface, are, usually, sufficient, for, a, while, after, reservoirs, are, first, tapped, in, some, reservoirs, such, as, in, the, middle, east, the, natural, pressure, is, sufficient, over, a, long, time, the, natural, pressure, in, most, reservoirs, however, eventually, dissipates, then, the, oil, must, be, extracted, using, artificial, lift, means, over, time, these, primary, methods, become, less, effective, and, secondary, production, methods, may, be, used, a, common, secondary, method, is, waterflood, or, injection, of, water, into, the, reservoir, to, increase, pressure, and, force, the, oil, to, the, drilled, shaft, or, wellbore, eventually, tertiary, or, enhanced, oil, recovery, methods, may, be, used, to, increase, the, oil, s, flow, characteristics, by, injecting, steam, carbon, dioxide, and, other, gases, or, chemicals, into, the, reservoir, in, the, united, states, primary, production, methods, account, for, less, than, 40, percent, of, the, oil, produced, on, a, daily, basis, secondary, methods, account, for, about, half, and, tertiary, recovery, the, remaining, 10, percent, extracting, oil, or, bitumen, from, oil, tar, sand, and, oil, shale, deposits, requires, mining, the, sand, or, shale, and, heating, it, in, a, vessel, or, retort, or, using, in, situ, methods, of, injecting, heated, liquids, into, the, deposit, and, then, pumping, the, liquid, back, out, saturated, with, oil, oil, eating, bacteria, biodegrade, oil, that, has, escaped, to, the, surface, oil, sands, are, reservoirs, of, partially, biodegraded, oil, still, in, the, process, of, escaping, and, being, biodegraded, but, they, contain, so, much, migrating, oil, that, although, most, of, it, has, escaped, vast, amounts, are, still, present, more, than, can, be, found, in, conventional, oil, reservoirs, the, lighter, fractions, of, the, crude, oil, are, destroyed, first, resulting, in, reservoirs, containing, an, extremely, heavy, form, of, crude, oil, called, crude, bitumen, in, canada, or, extra, heavy, crude, oil, in, venezuela, these, two, countries, have, the, world, s, largest, deposits, of, oil, sands, on, the, other, hand, oil, shales, are, source, rocks, that, have, not, been, exposed, to, heat, or, pressure, long, enough, to, convert, their, trapped, hydrocarbons, into, crude, oil, technically, speaking, oil, shales, are, not, always, shales, and, do, not, contain, oil, but, are, fined, grain, sedimentary, rocks, containing, an, insoluble, organic, solid, called, kerogen, the, kerogen, in, the, rock, can, be, converted, into, crude, oil, using, heat, and, pressure, to, simulate, natural, processes, the, method, has, been, known, for, centuries, and, was, patented, in, 1694, under, british, crown, patent, no, 330, covering, a, way, to, extract, and, make, great, quantities, of, pitch, tar, and, oil, out, of, a, sort, of, stone, although, oil, shales, are, found, in, many, countries, the, united, states, has, the, world, s, largest, deposits, the, petroleum, industry, generally, classifies, crude, oil, by, the, geographic, location, it, is, produced, in, e, g, west, texas, intermediate, brent, or, oman, its, api, gravity, an, oil, industry, measure, of, density, and, its, sulfur, content, crude, oil, may, be, considered, light, if, it, has, low, density, heavy, if, it, has, high, density, or, medium, if, it, has, a, density, between, that, of, light, and, heavy, additionally, it, may, be, referred, to, as, sweet, if, it, contains, relatively, little, sulfur, or, sour, if, it, contains, substantial, amounts, of, sulfur, the, geographic, location, is, important, because, it, affects, transportation, costs, to, the, refinery, light, crude, oil, is, more, desirable, than, heavy, oil, since, it, produces, a, higher, yield, of, gasoline, while, sweet, oil, commands, a, higher, price, than, sour, oil, because, it, has, fewer, environmental, problems, and, requires, less, refining, to, meet, sulfur, standards, imposed, on, fuels, in, consuming, countries, each, crude, oil, has, unique, molecular, characteristics, which, are, revealed, by, the, use, of, crude, oil, assay, analysis, in, petroleum, laboratories, barrels, from, an, area, in, which, the, crude, oil, s, molecular, characteristics, have, been, determined, and, the, oil, has, been, classified, are, used, as, pricing, references, throughout, the, world, some, of, the, common, reference, crudes, are, there, are, declining, amounts, of, these, benchmark, oils, being, produced, each, year, so, other, oils, are, more, commonly, what, is, actually, delivered, while, the, reference, price, may, be, for, west, texas, intermediate, delivered, at, cushing, the, actual, oil, being, traded, may, be, a, discounted, canadian, heavy, oil, western, canadian, select, delivered, at, hardisty, alberta, and, for, a, brent, blend, delivered, at, shetland, it, may, be, a, discounted, russian, export, blend, delivered, at, the, port, of, primorsk, once, extracted, oil, is, refined, and, separated, most, easily, by, distillation, into, numerous, products, for, direct, use, or, use, in, manufacturing, such, as, gasoline, petrol, diesel, and, kerosene, to, asphalt, and, chemical, reagents, ethylene, propylene, butene, acrylic, acid, para, xylene, used, to, make, plastics, pesticides, and, pharmaceuticals, in, terms, of, volume, most, petroleum, is, converted, into, fuels, for, combustion, engines, in, terms, of, value, petroleum, underpins, the, petrochemical, industry, which, includes, many, high, value, products, such, as, pharmaceuticals, and, plastics, petroleum, is, used, mostly, by, volume, for, refining, into, fuel, oil, and, gasoline, both, important, primary, energy, sources, 84, by, volume, of, the, hydrocarbons, present, in, petroleum, is, converted, into, fuels, including, gasoline, diesel, jet, heating, and, other, fuel, oils, and, liquefied, petroleum, gas, due, to, its, high, energy, density, easy, transportability, and, relative, abundance, oil, has, become, the, world, s, most, important, source, of, energy, since, the, mid, 1950s, petroleum, is, also, the, raw, material, for, many, chemical, products, including, pharmaceuticals, solvents, fertilizers, pesticides, and, plastics, the, 16, percent, not, used, for, energy, production, is, converted, into, these, other, materials, petroleum, is, found, in, porous, rock, formations, in, the, upper, strata, of, some, areas, of, the, earth, s, crust, there, is, also, petroleum, in, oil, sands, tar, sands, known, oil, reserves, are, typically, estimated, at, 190, km, 3, 1, 2, trillion, short, scale, barrels, without, oil, sands, or, 595, km, 3, 3, 74, trillion, barrels, with, oil, sands, consumption, is, currently, around, 84, million, barrels, 13, 4, 10, 6, m, 3, per, day, or, 4, 9, km, 3, per, year, yielding, a, remaining, oil, supply, of, only, about, 120, years, if, current, demand, remains, static, more, recent, studies, however, put, the, number, at, around, 50, years, closely, related, to, fuels, for, combustion, engines, are, lubricants, greases, and, viscosity, stabilizers, all, are, derived, from, petroleum, many, pharmaceuticals, are, derived, from, petroleum, albeit, via, multistep, processes, modern, medicine, depends, on, petroleum, as, a, source, of, building, blocks, reagents, and, solvents, similarly, virtually, all, pesticides, insecticides, herbicides, etc, are, derived, from, petroleum, pesticides, have, profoundly, affected, life, expectancies, by, controlling, disease, vectors, and, by, increasing, yields, of, crops, like, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, are, in, essence, petrochemicals, virtually, all, plastics, and, synthetic, polymers, are, derived, from, petroleum, which, is, the, source, of, monomers, alkenes, olefins, are, one, important, class, of, these, precursor, molecules, the, petroleum, industry, also, known, as, the, oil, industry, or, the, oil, patch, includes, the, global, processes, of, exploration, extraction, refining, transportation, often, by, oil, tankers, and, pipelines, and, marketing, of, petroleum, products, the, largest, volume, products, of, the, industry, are, fuel, oil, and, gasoline, petrol, petroleum, is, also, the, raw, material, for, many, chemical, products, including, pharmaceuticals, solvents, fertilizers, pesticides, synthetic, fragrances, and, plastics, the, industry, is, usually, divided, into, three, major, components, upstream, midstream, and, downstream, upstream, regards, exploration, and, extraction, of, crude, oil, midstream, encompasses, transportation, and, storage, of, crude, and, downstream, concerns, refining, crude, oil, into, various, end, products, petroleum, is, vital, to, many, industries, and, is, necessary, for, the, maintenance, of, industrial, civilization, in, its, current, configuration, making, it, a, critical, concern, for, many, nations, oil, accounts, for, a, large, percentage, of, the, world, s, energy, consumption, ranging, from, a, low, of, 32, for, europe, and, asia, to, a, high, of, 53, for, the, middle, east, in, the, 1950s, shipping, costs, made, up, 33, percent, of, the, price, of, oil, transported, from, the, persian, gulf, to, the, united, states, but, due, to, the, development, of, supertankers, in, the, 1970s, the, cost, of, shipping, dropped, to, only, 5, percent, of, the, price, of, persian, oil, in, the, us, due, to, the, increase, in, the, value, of, crude, oil, during, the, last, 30, years, the, share, of, the, shipping, cost, on, the, final, cost, of, the, delivered, commodity, was, less, than, 3, in, 2010, the, price, of, oil, or, the, oil, price, generally, refers, to, the, spot, price, of, a, barrel, 159, litres, of, benchmark, crude, oil, a, reference, price, for, buyers, and, sellers, of, crude, oil, such, as, west, texas, intermediate, wti, brent, crude, dubai, crude, opec, reference, basket, tapis, crude, bonny, light, urals, oil, isthmus, and, western, canadian, select, wcs, oil, prices, are, determined, by, global, supply, and, demand, rather, than, any, country, s, domestic, production, level, the, global, price, of, crude, oil, was, relatively, consistent, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, early, twentieth, century, this, changed, in, the, 1970s, with, a, significant, increase, in, the, price, of, oil, globally, there, have, been, a, number, of, structural, drivers, of, global, oil, prices, historically, including, oil, supply, demand, and, storage, shocks, and, shocks, to, global, economic, growth, affecting, oil, prices, notable, events, driving, significant, price, fluctuations, include, the, 1973, opec, oil, embargo, targeting, nations, that, had, supported, israel, during, the, yom, kippur, war, 329, resulting, in, the, 1973, oil, crisis, the, iranian, revolution, in, the, 1979, oil, crisis, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, and, the, more, recent, 2013, oil, supply, glut, that, led, to, the, largest, oil, price, declines, in, modern, history, in, 2014, to, 2016, the, 70, decline, in, global, oil, prices, was, one, of, the, three, biggest, declines, since, world, war, ii, and, the, longest, lasting, since, the, supply, driven, collapse, of, 1986, by, 2015, the, united, states, had, become, the, third, largest, producer, of, oil, and, resumed, exporting, oil, upon, repeal, of,

with, water, certain, naturally, occurring, bacteria, such, as, micrococcus, arthrobacter, and, rhodococcus, have, been, shown, to, degrade, these, contaminants, because, petroleum, is, a, naturally, occurring, substance, its, presence, in, the, environment, does, not, need, to, be, the, result, of, human, causes, such, as, accidents, and, routine, activities, seismic, exploration, drilling,

but, as, of, 2022, the, best, alternatives, are, unclear, control, of, petroleum, production, has, been, a, significant, driver, of, international, relations, during, much, of, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, organizations, like, opec, have, played, an, outsized, role, in, international, politics, some, historians, and, commentators, have, called, this, the, age, of, oil, with, the, rise, of, renewable, energy, and, addressing, climate, change, some, commentators, expect, a, realignment, of, international, power, away, from, petrostates, oil, rents, have, been, described, as, connected, with, corruption, in, political, literature, a, 2011, study, suggested, that, increases, in, oil, rents, increased, corruption, in, countries, with, heavy, government, involvement, in, the, production, of, oil, the, study, found, that, increases, in, oil, rents, significantly, deteriorates, political, rights, the, investigators, say, that, oil, exploitation, gave, politicians, an, incentive, to, extend, civil, liberties, but, reduce, political, rights, in, the, presence, of, oil, windfalls, to, evade, redistribution, and, conflict, petroleum, production, has, been, linked, with, conflict, for, many, years, leading, to, thousands, of, deaths, petroleum, deposits, are, in, hardly, any, countries, around, the, world, mainly, in, russia, and, some, parts, of, the, middle, east, conflicts, may, start, when, countries, refuse, to, cut, oil, production, in, which, other, countries, respond, to, such, actions, by, increasing, their, production, causing, a, trade, war, as, experienced, during, the, 2020, russia, saudi, arabia, oil, price, war, other, conflicts, start, due, to, countries, wanting, petroleum, resources, or, other, reasons, on, oil, resource, territory,

producing, and, oil, dependent, countries, in, order, to, collectively, influence, the, global, oil, market, and, maximize, profit, it, was, founded, on, 14, september, 1960, in, baghdad, by, the, first, five, members, iran, iraq, kuwait, saudi, arabia, and, venezuela, the, organization, which, currently, comprises, 12, member, countries, accounted, for, an, estimated, 30, percent, of, global, oil, production, a, 2022, report, further, details, that, opec, member, countries, were, responsible, for, approximately, 38, percent, of, it, additionally, it, is, estimated, that, 79, 5, percent, of, the, world, s, proven, oil, reserves, are, located, within, opec, nations, with, the, middle, east, alone, accounting, for, 67, 2, percent, of, opec, s, total, reserves, in, a, series, of, steps, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, opec, restructured, the, global, system, of, oil, production, in, favor, of, oil, producing, states, and, away, from, an, oligopoly, of, dominant, anglo, american, oil, firms, the, seven, sisters, in, the, 1970s, restrictions, in, oil, production, led, to, a, dramatic, rise, in, oil, prices, with, long, lasting, and, far, reaching, consequences, for, the, global, economy, since, the, 1980s, opec, has, had, a, limited, impact, on, world, oil, supply, and, oil, price, stability, as, there, is, frequent, cheating, by, members, on, their, commitments, to, one, another, and, as, member, commitments, reflect, what, they, would, do, even, in, the, absence, of, opec, however, since, 2020, opec, countries, along, with, non, opec, participants, had, helped, in, stabilising, oil, markets, after, the, covid, 19, pandemic, resulted, in, a, collapse, in, oil, demand, this, has, allowed, oil, markets, to, remain, stable, relative, to, other, energy, markets, that, experienced, unprecedented, volatility, the, formation, of, opec, marked, a, turning, point, toward, national, sovereignty, over, natural, resources, opec, decisions, have, come, to, play, a, prominent, role, in, the, global, oil, market, and, in, international, relations, economists, have, characterized, opec, as, a, textbook, example, of, a, cartel, a, group, whose, members, cooperate, to, reduce, market, competition, but, one, whose, consultations, may, be, protected, by, the, doctrine, of, state, immunity, under, international, law, consumption, in, the, twentieth, and, twenty, first, centuries, has, been, abundantly, pushed, by, automobile, sector, growth, the, 1985, 2003, oil, glut, even, fueled, the, sales, of, low, fuel, economy, vehicles, in, oecd, countries, the, 2008, economic, crisis, seems, to, have, had, some, impact, on, the, sales, of, such, vehicles, still, in, 2008, oil, consumption, showed, a, small, increase, in, 2016, goldman, sachs, predicted, lower, demand, for, oil, due, to, emerging, economies, concerns, especially, china, the, brics, brasil, russia, india, china, south, africa, countries, might, also, kick, in, as, china, briefly, had, the, largest, automobile, market, in, december, 2009, in, the, long, term, uncertainties, linger, the, opec, believes, that, the, oecd, countries, will, push, low, consumption, policies, at, some, point, in, the, future, when, that, happens, it, will, definitely, curb, oil, sales, and, both, opec, and, the, energy, information, administration, eia, kept, lowering, their, 2020, consumption, estimates, during, the, past, five, years, a, detailed, review, of, international, energy, agency, oil, projections, have, revealed, that, revisions, of, world, oil, production, price, and, investments, have, been, motivated, by, a, combination, of, demand, and, supply, factors, all, together, non, opec, conventional, projections, have, been, fairly, stable, the, last, 15, years, while, downward, revisions, were, mainly, allocated, to, opec, upward, revisions, are, primarily, a, result, of, us, tight, oil, production, will, also, face, an, increasingly, complex, situation, while, opec, countries, still, have, large, reserves, at, low, production, prices, newly, found, reservoirs, often, lead, to, higher, prices, offshore, giants, such, as, tupi, guara, and, tiber, demand, high, investments, and, ever, increasing, technological, abilities, subsalt, reservoirs, such, as, tupi, were, unknown, in, the, twentieth, century, mainly, because, the, industry, was, unable, to, probe, them, enhanced, oil, recovery, eor, techniques, example, daqing, china, will, continue, to, play, a, major, role, in, increasing, the, world, s, recoverable, oil, the, expected, availability, of, petroleum, resources, has, always, been, around, 35, years, or, even, less, since, the, start, of, the, modern, exploration, the, oil, constant, an, insider, pun, in, the, german, industry, refers, to, that, effect, a, growing, number, of, divestment, campaigns, from, major, funds, pushed, by, newer, generations, who, question, the, sustainability, of, petroleum, may, hinder, the, financing, of, future, oil, prospection, and, production, peak, oil, is, a, term, applied, to, the, projection, that, future, petroleum, production, whether, for, individual, oil, wells, entire, oil, fields, whole, countries, or, worldwide, production, will, eventually, peak, and, then, decline, at, a, similar, rate, to, the, rate, of, increase, before, the, peak, as, these, reserves, are, exhausted, the, peak, of, oil, discoveries, was, in, 1965, and, oil, production, per, year, has, surpassed, oil, discoveries, every, year, since, 1980, however, this, does, not, mean, that, potential, oil, production, has, surpassed, oil, demand, it, is, difficult, to, predict, the, oil, peak, in, any, given, region, due, to, the, lack, of, knowledge, and, or, transparency, in, the, accounting, of, global, oil, reserves, based, on, available, production, data, proponents, have, previously, predicted, the, peak, for, the, world, to, be, in, the, years, 1989, 1995, or, 1995, 2000, some, of, these, predictions, date, from, before, the, recession, of, the, early, 1980s, and, the, consequent, lowering, in, global, consumption, the, effect, of, which, was, to, delay, the, date, of, any, peak, by, several, years, just, as, the, 1971, u, s, peak, in, oil, production, was, only, clearly, recognized, after, the, fact, a, peak, in, world, production, will, be, difficult, to, discern, until, production, clearly, drops, off, in, 2020, according, to, bp, s, energy, outlook, 2020, peak, oil, had, been, reached, due, to, the, changing, energy, landscape, coupled, with, the, economic, toll, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, while, there, has, been, much, focus, historically, on, peak, oil, supply, the, focus, is, increasingly, shifting, to, peak, demand, as, more, countries, seek, to, transition, to, renewable, energy, the, gegalo, index, of, geopolitical, gains, and, losses, assesses, how, the, geopolitical, position, of, 156, countries, may, change, if, the, world, fully, transitions, to, renewable, energy, resources, former, oil, exporters, are, expected, to, lose, power, while, the, positions, of, former, oil, importers, and, countries, rich, in, renewable, energy, resources, is, expected, to, strengthen, unconventional, oil, is, petroleum, produced, or, extracted, using, techniques, other, than, the, conventional, methods, the, calculus, for, peak, oil, has, changed, with, the, introduction, of, unconventional, production, methods, in, particular, the, combination, of, horizontal, drilling, and, hydraulic, fracturing, has, resulted, in, a, significant, increase, in, production, from, previously, uneconomic, plays, certain, rock, strata, contain, hydrocarbons, but, have, low, permeability, and, are, not, thick, from, a, vertical, perspective, conventional, vertical, wells, would, be, unable, to, economically, retrieve, these, hydrocarbons, horizontal, drilling, extending, horizontally, through, the, strata, permits, the, well, to, access, a, much, greater, volume, of, the, strata, hydraulic, fracturing, creates, greater, permeability, and, increases, hydrocarbon, flow, to, the, wellbore, on, saturn, s, largest, moon, titan, lakes, of, liquid, hydrocarbons, comprising, methane, ethane, propane, and, other, constituents, occur, naturally, data, collected, by, the, space, probe, cassini, huygens, yield, an, estimate, that, the, visible, lakes, and, seas, of, titan, contain, about, 300, times, the, volume, of, earth, s, proven, oil, reserves, drilled, samples, from, the, surface, of, mars, taken, in, 2015, by, the, curiosity, rover, s, mars, science, laboratory, have, found, organic, molecules, of, benzene, and, propane, in, 3, billion, year, old, rock, samples, in, gale, crater
