a, wind, turbine, is, a, device, that, converts, the, kinetic, energy, of, wind, into, electrical, energy, as, of, 2020, hundreds, of, thousands, of, large, turbines, in, installations, known, as, wind, farms, were, generating, over, 650, gigawatts, of, power, with, 60, gw, added, each, year, wind, turbines, are, an, increasingly, important, source, of, intermittent, renewable, energy, and, are, used, in, many, countries, to, lower, energy, costs, and, reduce, reliance, on, fossil, fuels, one, study, claimed, that, as, of, 2009, wind, had, the, lowest, relative, greenhouse, gas, emissions, the, least, water, consumption, demands, and, the, most, favorable, social, impacts, compared, to, photovoltaic, hydro, geothermal, coal, and, gas, energy, sources, smaller, wind, turbines, are, used, for, applications, such, as, battery, charging, and, remote, devices, such, as, traffic, warning, signs, larger, turbines, can, contribute, to, a, domestic, power, supply, while, selling, unused, power, back, to, the, utility, supplier, via, the, electrical, grid, wind, turbines, are, manufactured, in, a, wide, range, of, sizes, with, either, horizontal, or, vertical, axes, though, horizontal, is, most, common, the, windwheel, of, hero, of, alexandria, 10, 70, ce, marks, one, of, the, first, recorded, instances, of, wind, powering, a, machine, however, the, first, known, practical, wind, power, plants, were, built, in, sistan, an, eastern, province, of, persia, now, iran, from, the, 7th, century, these, panemone, were, vertical, axle, windmills, which, had, long, vertical, drive, shafts, with, rectangular, blades, made, of, six, to, twelve, sails, covered, in, reed, matting, or, cloth, material, these, windmills, were, used, to, grind, grain, or, draw, up, water, and, were, used, in, the, gristmilling, and, sugarcane, industries, wind, power, first, appeared, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, the, first, historical, records, of, their, use, in, england, date, to, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, there, are, reports, of, german, crusaders, taking, their, windmill, making, skills, to, syria, around, 1190, by, the, 14th, century, dutch, windmills, were, in, use, to, drain, areas, of, the, rhine, delta, advanced, wind, turbines, were, described, by, croatian, inventor, fausto, veranzio, in, his, book, machinae, novae, 1595, he, described, vertical, axis, wind, turbines, with, curved, or, v, shaped, blades, the, first, electricity, generating, wind, turbine, was, installed, by, the, austrian, josef, friedl, nder, at, the, vienna, international, electrical, exhibition, in, 1883, it, was, a, halladay, windmill, for, driving, a, dynamo, friedl, nder, s, 6, 6, m, 22, ft, diameter, halladay, wind, motor, was, supplied, by, u, s, wind, engine, pump, co, of, batavia, illinois, the, 3, 7, kw, 5, hp, windmill, drove, a, dynamo, at, ground, level, that, fed, electricity, into, a, series, of, batteries, the, batteries, powered, various, electrical, tools, and, lamps, as, well, as, a, threshing, machine, friedl, nder, s, windmill, and, its, accessories, were, prominently, installed, at, the, north, entrance, to, the, main, exhibition, hall, rotunde, in, the, vienna, prater, in, july, 1887, scottish, academic, james, blyth, installed, a, battery, charging, machine, to, light, his, holiday, home, in, marykirk, scotland, some, months, later, american, inventor, charles, f, brush, was, able, to, build, the, first, automatically, operated, wind, turbine, after, consulting, local, university, professors, and, his, colleagues, jacob, s, gibbs, and, brinsley, coleberd, and, successfully, getting, the, blueprints, peer, reviewed, for, electricity, production, although, blyth, s, turbine, was, considered, uneconomical, in, the, united, kingdom, electricity, generation, by, wind, turbines, was, more, cost, effective, in, countries, with, widely, scattered, populations, in, denmark, by, 1900, there, were, about, 2500, windmills, for, mechanical, loads, such, as, pumps, and, mills, producing, an, estimated, combined, peak, power, of, about, 30, megawatts, mw, the, largest, machines, were, on, 24, metre, 79, ft, towers, with, four, bladed, 23, metre, 75, ft, diameter, rotors, by, 1908, there, were, 72, wind, driven, electric, generators, operating, in, the, united, states, from, 5, kilowatts, kw, to, 25, kw, around, the, time, of, world, war, i, american, windmill, makers, were, producing, 100, 000, farm, windmills, each, year, mostly, for, water, pumping, by, the, 1930s, use, of, wind, turbines, in, rural, areas, was, declining, as, the, distribution, system, extended, to, those, areas, a, forerunner, of, modern, horizontal, axis, wind, generators, was, in, service, at, yalta, ussr, in, 1931, this, was, a, 100, kw, generator, on, a, 30, meter, 98, ft, tower, connected, to, the, local, 6, 3, kv, distribution, system, it, was, reported, to, have, an, annual, capacity, factor, of, 32, percent, not, much, different, from, current, wind, machines, in, the, autumn, of, 1941, the, first, megawatt, class, wind, turbine, was, synchronized, to, a, utility, grid, in, vermont, the, smith, putnam, wind, turbine, only, ran, for, about, five, years, before, one, of, the, blades, snapped, off, the, unit, was, not, repaired, because, of, a, shortage, of, materials, during, the, war, the, first, utility, grid, connected, wind, turbine, to, operate, in, the, uk, was, built, by, john, brown, company, in, 1951, in, the, orkney, islands, in, the, early, 1970s, however, anti, nuclear, protests, in, denmark, spurred, artisan, mechanics, to, develop, microturbines, of, 22, kw, despite, declines, in, the, industry, organizing, owners, into, associations, and, co, operatives, led, to, the, lobbying, of, the, government, and, utilities, and, provided, incentives, for, larger, turbines, throughout, the, 1980s, and, later, local, activists, in, germany, nascent, turbine, manufacturers, in, spain, and, large, investors, in, the, united, states, in, the, early, 1990s, then, lobbied, for, policies, that, stimulated, the, industry, in, those, countries, it, has, been, argued, that, expanding, the, use, of, wind, power, will, lead, to, increasing, geopolitical, competition, over, critical, materials, for, wind, turbines, such, as, rare, earth, elements, neodymium, praseodymium, and, dysprosium, however, this, perspective, has, been, critically, dismissed, for, failing, to, relay, how, most, wind, turbines, do, not, use, permanent, magnets, and, for, underestimating, the, power, of, economic, incentives, for, the, expanded, production, of, these, minerals, wind, power, density, wpd, is, a, quantitative, measure, of, wind, energy, available, at, any, location, it, is, the, mean, annual, power, available, per, square, meter, of, swept, area, of, a, turbine, and, is, calculated, for, different, heights, above, ground, calculation, of, wind, power, density, includes, the, effect, of, wind, velocity, and, air, density, wind, turbines, are, classified, by, the, wind, speed, they, are, designed, for, from, class, i, to, class, iii, with, a, to, c, referring, to, the, turbulence, intensity, of, the, wind, conservation, of, mass, requires, that, the, mass, of, air, entering, and, exiting, a, turbine, must, be, equal, likewise, the, conservation, of, energy, requires, the, energy, given, to, the, turbine, from, incoming, wind, to, be, equal, to, that, of, the, combination, of, the, energy, in, the, outgoing, wind, and, the, energy, converted, to, electrical, energy, since, outgoing, wind, will, still, possess, some, kinetic, energy, there, must, be, a, maximum, proportion, of, the, input, energy, that, is, available, to, be, converted, to, electrical, energy, accordingly, betz, s, law, gives, the, maximal, achievable, extraction, of, wind, power, by, a, wind, turbine, known, as, betz, s, coefficient, as, 16, 27, 59, 3, of, the, rate, at, which, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, air, arrives, at, the, turbine, the, maximum, theoretical, power, output, of, a, wind, machine, is, thus, 16, 27, times, the, rate, at, which, kinetic, energy, of, the, air, arrives, at, the, effective, disk, area, of, the, machine, if, the, effective, area, of, the, disk, is, a, and, the, wind, velocity, v, the, maximum, theoretical, power, output, p, is, where, is, the, air, density, wind, to, rotor, efficiency, including, rotor, blade, friction, and, drag, are, among, the, factors, affecting, the, final, price, of, wind, power, further, inefficiencies, such, as, gearbox, generator, and, converter, losses, reduce, the, power, delivered, by, a, wind, turbine, to, protect, components, from, undue, wear, extracted, power, is, held, constant, above, the, rated, operating, speed, as, theoretical, power, increases, as, the, cube, of, wind, speed, further, reducing, theoretical, efficiency, in, 2001, commercial, utility, connected, turbines, delivered, 75, to, 80, of, the, betz, limit, of, power, extractable, from, the, wind, at, rated, operating, speed, efficiency, can, decrease, slightly, over, time, one, of, the, main, reasons, being, dust, and, insect, carcasses, on, the, blades, which, alter, the, aerodynamic, profile, and, essentially, reduce, the, lift, to, drag, ratio, of, the, airfoil, analysis, of, 3128, wind, turbines, older, than, 10, years, in, denmark, showed, that, half, of, the, turbines, had, no, decrease, while, the, other, half, saw, a, production, decrease, of, 1, 2, per, year, in, general, more, stable, and, constant, weather, conditions, most, notably, wind, speed, result, in, an, average, of, 15, greater, efficiency, than, that, of, a, wind, turbine, in, unstable, weather, conditions, thus, allowing, up, to, a, 7, increase, in, wind, speed, under, stable, conditions, this, is, due, to, a, faster, recovery, wake, and, greater, flow, entrainment, that, occur, in, conditions, of, higher, atmospheric, stability, however, wind, turbine, wakes, have, been, found, to, recover, faster, under, unstable, atmospheric, conditions, as, opposed, to, a, stable, environment, different, materials, have, varying, effects, on, the, efficiency, of, wind, turbines, in, an, ege, university, experiment, three, wind, turbines, each, with, three, blades, with, a, diameter, of, one, meter, were, constructed, with, blades, made, of, different, materials, a, glass, and, glass, carbon, epoxy, glass, carbon, and, glass, polyester, when, tested, the, results, showed, that, the, materials, with, higher, overall, masses, had, a, greater, friction, moment, and, thus, a, lower, power, coefficient, the, air, velocity, is, the, major, contributor, to, the, turbine, efficiency, this, is, the, reason, for, the, importance, of, choosing, the, right, location, the, wind, velocity, will, be, high, near, the, shore, because, of, the, temperature, difference, between, the, land, and, the, ocean, another, option, is, to, place, turbines, on, mountain, ridges, the, higher, the, wind, turbine, will, be, the, higher, the, wind, velocity, on, average, a, windbreak, can, also, increase, the, wind, velocity, near, the, turbine, wind, turbines, can, rotate, about, either, a, horizontal, or, a, vertical, axis, the, former, being, both, older, and, more, common, they, can, also, include, blades, or, be, bladeless, household, size, vertical, designs, produce, less, power, and, are, less, common, large, three, bladed, horizontal, axis, wind, turbines, hawt, with, the, blades, upwind, of, the, tower, i, e, blades, facing, the, incoming, wind, produce, the, overwhelming, majority, of, wind, power, in, the, world, today, these, turbines, have, the, main, rotor, shaft, and, electrical, generator, at, the, top, of, a, tower, and, must, be, pointed, into, the, wind, small, turbines, are, pointed, by, a, simple, wind, vane, while, large, turbines, generally, use, a, wind, sensor, coupled, with, a, yaw, system, most, have, a, gearbox, which, turns, the, slow, rotation, of, the, blades, into, a, quicker, rotation, that, is, more, suitable, to, drive, an, electrical, generator, some, turbines, use, a, different, type, of, generator, suited, to, slower, rotational, speed, input, these, don, t, need, a, gearbox, and, are, called, direct, drive, meaning, they, couple, the, rotor, directly, to, the, generator, with, no, gearbox, in, between, while, permanent, magnet, direct, drive, generators, can, be, more, costly, due, to, the, rare, earth, materials, required, these, gearless, turbines, are, sometimes, preferred, over, gearbox, generators, because, they, eliminate, the, gear, speed, increaser, which, is, susceptible, to, significant, accumulated, fatigue, torque, loading, related, reliability, issues, and, maintenance, costs, there, is, also, the, pseudo, direct, drive, mechanism, which, has, some, advantages, over, the, permanent, magnet, direct, drive, mechanism, most, horizontal, axis, turbines, have, their, rotors, upwind, of, the, supporting, tower, downwind, machines, have, been, built, because, they, don, t, need, an, additional, mechanism, for, keeping, them, in, line, with, the, wind, in, high, winds, downwind, blades, can, also, be, designed, to, bend, more, than, upwind, ones, which, reduces, their, swept, area, and, thus, their, wind, resistance, mitigating, risk, during, gales, despite, these, advantages, upwind, designs, are, preferred, because, the, pulsing, change, in, loading, from, the, wind, as, each, blade, passes, behind, the, supporting, tower, can, cause, damage, to, the, turbine, turbines, used, in, wind, farms, for, commercial, production, of, electric, power, are, usually, three, bladed, these, have, low, torque, ripple, which, contributes, to, good, reliability, the, blades, are, usually, colored, white, for, daytime, visibility, by, aircraft, and, range, in, length, from, 20, to, 80, meters, 66, to, 262, ft, the, size, and, height, of, turbines, increase, year, by, year, offshore, wind, turbines, are, built, up, to, 8, mw, today, and, have, a, blade, length, up, to, 80, meters, 260, ft, designs, with, 10, to, 12, mw, were, in, preparation, in, 2018, and, a, 15, mw, prototype, with, three, 118, metre, 387, ft, blades, is, planned, to, be, constructed, in, 2022, the, average, hub, height, of, horizontal, axis, wind, turbines, is, 90, meters, vertical, axis, wind, turbines, or, vawts, have, the, main, rotor, shaft, arranged, vertically, one, advantage, of, this, arrangement, is, that, the, turbine, does, not, need, to, be, pointed, into, the, wind, to, be, effective, which, is, an, advantage, on, a, site, where, the, wind, direction, is, highly, variable, it, is, also, an, advantage, when, the, turbine, is, integrated, into, a, building, because, it, is, inherently, less, steerable, also, the, generator, and, gearbox, can, be, placed, near, the, ground, using, a, direct, drive, from, the, rotor, assembly, to, the, ground, based, gearbox, improving, accessibility, for, maintenance, however, these, designs, produce, much, less, energy, averaged, over, time, which, is, a, major, drawback, vertical, turbine, designs, have, much, lower, efficiency, than, standard, horizontal, designs, the, key, disadvantages, include, the, relatively, low, rotational, speed, with, the, consequential, higher, torque, and, hence, higher, cost, of, the, drive, train, the, inherently, lower, power, coefficient, the, 360, degree, rotation, of, the, aerofoil, within, the, wind, flow, during, each, cycle, and, hence, the, highly, dynamic, loading, on, the, blade, the, pulsating, torque, generated, by, some, rotor, designs, on, the, drive, train, and, the, difficulty, of, modelling, the, wind, flow, accurately, and, hence, the, challenges, of, analysing, and, designing, the, rotor, prior, to, fabricating, a, prototype, when, a, turbine, is, mounted, on, a, rooftop, the, building, generally, redirects, wind, over, the, roof, and, this, can, double, the, wind, speed, at, the, turbine, if, the, height, of, a, rooftop, mounted, turbine, tower, is, approximately, 50, of, the, building, height, it, is, near, the, optimum, for, maximum, wind, energy, and, minimum, wind, turbulence, while, wind, speeds, within, the, built, environment, are, generally, much, lower, than, at, exposed, rural, sites, noise, may, be, a, concern, and, an, existing, structure, may, not, adequately, resist, the, additional, stress, subtypes, of, the, vertical, axis, design, include, eggbeater, turbines, or, darrieus, turbines, were, named, after, the, french, inventor, georges, darrieus, they, have, good, efficiency, but, produce, large, torque, ripple, and, cyclical, stress, on, the, tower, which, contributes, to, poor, reliability, they, also, generally, require, some, external, power, source, or, an, additional, savonius, rotor, to, start, turning, because, the, starting, torque, is, very, low, the, torque, ripple, is, reduced, by, using, three, or, more, blades, which, results, in, greater, solidity, of, the, rotor, solidity, is, measured, by, the, blade, area, divided, by, the, rotor, area, a, subtype, of, darrieus, turbine, with, straight, as, opposed, to, curved, blades, the, cycloturbine, variety, has, variable, pitch, to, reduce, the, torque, pulsation, and, is, self, starting, the, advantages, of, variable, pitch, are, high, starting, torque, a, wide, relatively, flat, torque, curve, a, higher, coefficient, of, performance, more, efficient, operation, in, turbulent, winds, and, a, lower, blade, speed, ratio, which, lowers, blade, bending, stresses, straight, v, or, curved, blades, may, be, used, these, are, drag, type, devices, with, two, or, more, scoops, that, are, used, in, anemometers, flettner, vents, commonly, seen, on, bus, and, van, roofs, and, in, some, high, reliability, low, efficiency, power, turbines, they, are, always, self, starting, if, there, are, at, least, three, scoops, twisted, savonius, is, a, modified, savonius, with, long, helical, scoops, to, provide, smooth, torque, this, is, often, used, as, a, rooftop, wind, turbine, and, has, even, been, adapted, for, ships, airborne, wind, turbines, consist, of, wings, or, a, small, aircraft, tethered, to, the, ground, they, are, useful, for, reaching, faster, winds, above, which, traditional, turbines, can, operate, there, are, prototypes, in, operation, in, east, africa, these, are, offshore, wind, turbines, that, are, supported, by, a, floating, platform, by, having, them, float, they, are, able, to, be, installed, in, deeper, water, allowing, more, of, them, this, also, allows, them, to, be, further, out, of, sight, from, land, and, therefore, less, public, concern, about, the, visual, appeal, wind, turbine, design, is, a, careful, balance, of, cost, energy, output, and, fatigue, life, wind, turbines, convert, wind, energy, to, electrical, energy, for, distribution, conventional, horizontal, axis, turbines, can, be, divided, into, three, components, a, 1, 5, mw, wind, turbine, of, a, type, frequently, seen, in, the, united, states, has, a, tower, 80, meters, 260, ft, high, the, rotor, assembly, blades, and, hub, measures, about, 80, meters, 260, ft, in, diameter, the, nacelle, which, contains, the, generator, is, 15, 24, meters, 50, 0, ft, and, weighs, around, 300, tons, due, to, data, transmission, problems, structural, health, monitoring, of, wind, turbines, is, usually, performed, using, several, accelerometers, and, strain, gages, attached, to, the, nacelle, to, monitor, the, gearbox, and, equipment, currently, digital, image, correlation, and, stereophotogrammetry, are, used, to, measure, dynamics, of, wind, turbine, blades, these, methods, usually, measure, displacement, and, strain, to, identify, location, of, defects, dynamic, characteristics, of, non, rotating, wind, turbines, have, been, measured, using, digital, image, correlation, and, photogrammetry, three, dimensional, point, tracking, has, also, been, used, to, measure, rotating, dynamics, of, wind, turbines, generally, efficiency, increases, along, with, turbine, blade, lengths, the, blades, must, be, stiff, strong, durable, light, and, resistant, to, fatigue, materials, with, these, properties, include, composites, such, as, polyester, and, epoxy, while, glass, fiber, and, carbon, fiber, have, been, used, for, the, reinforcing, construction, may, involve, manual, layup, or, injection, molding, retrofitting, existing, turbines, with, larger, blades, reduces, the, task, and, risks, of, redesign, as, of, 2021, the, longest, blade, was, 115, 5, m, 379, ft, producing, 15, mw, blades, usually, last, around, 20, years, the, typical, lifespan, of, a, wind, turbine, materials, commonly, used, in, wind, turbine, blades, are, described, below, the, stiffness, of, composites, is, determined, by, the, stiffness, of, fibers, and, their, volume, content, typically, e, glass, fibers, are, used, as, main, reinforcement, in, the, composites, typically, the, glass, epoxy, composites, for, wind, turbine, blades, contain, up, to, 75, glass, by, weight, this, increases, the, stiffness, tensile, and, compression, strength, a, promising, composite, material, is, glass, fiber, with, modified, compositions, like, s, glass, r, glass, etc, other, glass, fibers, developed, by, owens, corning, are, ecrglas, advantex, and, windstrand, carbon, fiber, has, more, tensile, strength, higher, stiffness, and, lower, density, than, glass, fiber, an, ideal, candidate, for, these, properties, is, the, spar, cap, a, structural, element, of, a, blade, that, experiences, high, tensile, loading, a, 100, metre, 330, ft, glass, fiber, blade, could, weigh, up, to, 50, tonnes, 110, 000, lb, while, using, carbon, fiber, in, the, spar, saves, 20, to, 30, weight, about, 15, tonnes, 33, 000, lb, instead, of, making, wind, turbine, blade, reinforcements, from, pure, glass, or, pure, carbon, hybrid, designs, trade, weight, for, cost, for, example, for, an, 8, metre, 26, ft, blade, a, full, replacement, by, carbon, fiber, would, save, 80, of, weight, but, increase, costs, by, 150, while, a, 30, replacement, would, save, 50, of, weight, and, increase, costs, by, 90, hybrid, reinforcement, materials, include, e, glass, carbon, e, glass, aramid, the, current, longest, blade, by, lm, wind, power, is, made, of, carbon, glass, hybrid, composites, more, research, is, needed, about, the, optimal, composition, of, materials, additions, of, small, amount, 0, 5, weight, of, nanoreinforcement, carbon, nanotubes, or, nanoclay, in, the, polymer, matrix, of, composites, fiber, sizing, or, inter, laminar, layers, can, improve, fatigue, resistance, shear, or, compressive, strength, and, fracture, toughness, of, the, composites, by, 30, to, 80, research, has, also, shown, that, incorporating, small, amounts, of, carbon, nanotubes, cnt, can, increase, the, lifetime, up, to, 1500, as, of, 2019, the, capital, cost, of, a, wind, turbine, was, around, 1, million, per, megawatt, of, nameplate, capacity, though, this, figure, varies, by, location, for, example, such, numbers, ranged, from, a, half, million, in, south, america, to, 1, 7, million, in, asia, for, the, wind, turbine, blades, while, the, material, cost, is, much, higher, for, hybrid, glass, carbon, fiber, blades, than, all, glass, fiber, blades, labor, costs, can, be, lower, using, carbon, fiber, allows, simpler, designs, that, use, less, raw, material, the, chief, manufacturing, process, in, blade, fabrication, is, the, layering, of, plies, thinner, blades, allow, reducing, the, number, of, layers, and, thus, the, labor, and, in, some, cases, equate, to, the, cost, of, labor, for, glass, fiber, blades, offshore, has, significantly, higher, installation, costs, wind, turbine, parts, other, than, the, rotor, blades, including, the, rotor, hub, gearbox, frame, and, tower, are, largely, made, of, steel, smaller, turbines, as, well, as, megawatt, scale, enercon, turbines, have, begun, using, aluminum, alloys, for, these, components, to, make, turbines, lighter, and, more, efficient, this, trend, may, grow, if, fatigue, and, strength, properties, can, be, improved, pre, stressed, concrete, has, been, increasingly, used, for, the, material, of, the, tower, but, still, requires, much, reinforcing, steel, to, meet, the, strength, requirement, of, the, turbine, additionally, step, up, gearboxes, are, being, increasingly, replaced, with, variable, speed, generators, which, requires, magnetic, materials, modern, turbines, use, a, couple, of, tons, of, copper, for, generators, and, cables, and, such, as, of, 2018, global, production, of, wind, turbines, use, 450, 000, tonnes, 990, million, pounds, of, copper, per, year, a, 2015, study, of, the, material, consumption, trends, and, requirements, for, wind, energy, in, europe, found, that, bigger, turbines, have, a, higher, consumption, of, precious, metals, but, lower, material, input, per, kw, generated, the, material, consumption, and, stock, at, that, time, was, compared, to, input, materials, for, various, onshore, system, sizes, in, all, eu, countries, the, estimates, for, 2020, doubled, the, values, consumed, in, 2009, these, countries, would, need, to, expand, their, resources, to, meet, the, estimated, demand, for, 2020, for, example, the, eu, had, 3, of, world, supply, of, fluorspar, and, it, would, require, 14, by, 2020, globally, the, main, exporting, countries, are, south, africa, mexico, and, china, this, is, similar, with, other, critical, and, valuable, materials, required, for, energy, systems, such, as, magnesium, silver, and, indium, the, levels, of, recycling, of, these, materials, are, very, low, and, focusing, on, that, could, alleviate, supply, because, most, of, these, valuable, materials, are, also, used, in, other, emerging, technologies, like, light, emitting, diodes, leds, photo, voltaics, pvs, and, liquid, crystal, displays, lcds, their, demand, is, expected, to, grow, a, 2011, study, by, the, united, states, geological, survey, estimated, resources, required, to, fulfill, the, us, commitment, to, supplying, 20, of, its, electricity, from, wind, power, by, 2030, it, did, not, consider, requirements, for, small, turbines, or, offshore, turbines, because, those, were, not, common, in, 2008, when, the, study, was, done, common, materials, such, as, cast, iron, steel, and, concrete, would, increase, by, 2, 3, compared, to, 2008, between, 110, 000, and, 115, 000, metric, tons, of, fiber, glass, would, be, required, per, year, a, 14, increase, rare, earth, metal, use, would, not, increase, much, compared, to, available, supply, however, rare, earth, metals, that, are, also, used, for, other, technologies, such, as, batteries, which, are, increasing, its, global, demand, need, to, be, taken, into, account, land, required, would, be, 50, 000, square, kilometers, onshore, and, 11, 000, offshore, this, would, not, be, a, problem, in, the, us, due, to, its, vast, area, and, because, the, same, land, can, be, used, for, farming, a, greater, challenge, would, be, the, variability, and, transmission, to, areas, of, high, demand, permanent, magnets, for, wind, turbine, generators, contain, rare, earth, metals, such, as, neodymium, nd, praseodymium, pr, terbium, tb, and, dysprosium, dy, systems, that, use, magnetic, direct, drive, turbines, require, greater, amounts, of, rare, earth, metals, therefore, an, increase, in, wind, turbine, manufacture, would, increase, the, demand, for, these, resources, by, 2035, the, demand, for, nd, is, estimated, to, increase, by, 4, 000, to, 18, 000, tons, and, for, dy, by, 200, to, 1, 200, tons, these, values, are, a, quarter, to, half, of, current, production, however, these, estimates, are, very, uncertain, because, technologies, are, developing, rapidly, reliance, on, rare, earth, minerals, for, components, has, risked, expense, and, price, volatility, as, china, has, been, main, producer, of, rare, earth, minerals, 96, in, 2009, and, was, reducing, its, export, quotas, however, in, recent, years, other, producers, have, increased, production, and, china, has, increased, export, quotas, leading, to, higher, supply, lower, cost, and, greater, viability, of, large, scale, use, of, variable, speed, generators, glass, fiber, is, the, most, common, material, for, reinforcement, its, demand, has, grown, due, to, growth, in, construction, transportation, and, wind, turbines, its, global, market, might, reach, us, 17, 4, billion, by, 2024, compared, to, us, 8, 5, billion, in, 2014, in, 2014, asia, pacific, produced, more, than, 45, of, the, market, now, china, is, the, largest, producer, the, industry, receives, subsidies, from, the, chinese, government, allowing, it, to, export, cheaper, to, the, us, and, europe, however, price, wars, have, led, to, anti, dumping, measures, such, as, tariffs, on, chinese, glass, fiber, a, few, localities, have, exploited, the, attention, getting, nature, of, wind, turbines, by, placing, them, on, public, display, either, with, visitor, centers, around, their, bases, or, with, viewing, areas, farther, away, the, wind, turbines, are, generally, of, conventional, horizontal, axis, three, bladed, design, and, generate, power, to, feed, electrical, grids, but, they, also, serve, the, unconventional, roles, of, technology, demonstration, public, relations, and, education, small, wind, turbines, may, be, used, for, a, variety, of, applications, including, on, or, off, grid, residences, telecom, towers, offshore, platforms, rural, schools, and, clinics, remote, monitoring, and, other, purposes, that, require, energy, where, there, is, no, electric, grid, or, where, the, grid, is, unstable, small, wind, turbines, may, be, as, small, as, a, fifty, watt, generator, for, boat, or, caravan, use, hybrid, solar, and, wind, powered, units, are, increasingly, being, used, for, traffic, signage, particularly, in, rural, locations, since, they, avoid, the, need, to, lay, long, cables, from, the, nearest, mains, connection, point, the, u, s, department, of, energy, s, national, renewable, energy, laboratory, nrel, defines, small, wind, turbines, as, those, smaller, than, or, equal, to, 100, kilowatts, small, units, often, have, direct, drive, generators, direct, current, output, aeroelastic, blades, and, lifetime, bearings, and, use, a, vane, to, point, into, the, wind, on, most, horizontal, wind, turbine, farms, a, spacing, of, about, 6, 10, times, the, rotor, diameter, is, often, upheld, however, for, large, wind, farms, distances, of, about, 15, rotor, diameters, should, be, more, economical, taking, into, account, typical, wind, turbine, and, land, costs, this, conclusion, has, been, reached, by, research, conducted, by, charles, meneveau, of, johns, hopkins, university, and, johan, meyers, of, leuven, university, in, belgium, based, on, computer, simulations, that, take, into, account, the, detailed, interactions, among, wind, turbines, wakes, as, well, as, with, the, entire, turbulent, atmospheric, boundary, layer, recent, research, by, john, dabiri, of, caltech, suggests, that, vertical, wind, turbines, may, be, placed, much, more, closely, together, so, long, as, an, alternating, pattern, of, rotation, is, created, allowing, blades, of, neighbouring, turbines, to, move, in, the, same, direction, as, they, approach, one, another, wind, turbines, need, regular, maintenance, to, stay, reliable, and, available, in, the, best, case, turbines, are, available, to, generate, energy, 98, of, the, time, ice, accretion, on, turbine, blades, has, also, been, found, to, greatly, reduce, the, efficiency, of, wind, turbines, which, is, a, common, challenge, in, cold, climates, where, in, cloud, icing, and, freezing, rain, events, occur, deicing, is, mainly, performed, by, internal, heating, or, in, some, cases, by, helicopters, spraying, clean, warm, water, on, the, blades, modern, turbines, usually, have, a, small, onboard, crane, for, hoisting, maintenance, tools, and, minor, components, however, large, heavy, components, like, generators, gearboxes, blades, and, so, on, are, rarely, replaced, and, a, heavy, lift, external, crane, is, needed, in, those, cases, if, the, turbine, has, a, difficult, access, road, a, containerized, crane, can, be, lifted, up, by, the, internal, crane, to, provide, heavier, lifting, installation, of, new, wind, turbines, can, be, controversial, an, alternative, is, repowering, where, existing, wind, turbines, are, replaced, with, bigger, more, powerful, ones, sometimes, in, smaller, numbers, while, keeping, or, increasing, capacity, some, wind, turbines, which, are, out, of, use, are, recycled, or, repowered, 85, of, turbine, materials, are, easily, reused, or, recycled, but, the, blades, made, of, a, composite, material, are, more, difficult, to, process, interest, in, recycling, blades, varies, in, different, markets, and, depends, on, the, waste, legislation, and, local, economics, a, challenge, in, recycling, blades, is, related, to, the, composite, material, which, is, made, of, fiberglass, with, carbon, fibers, in, epoxy, resin, which, cannot, be, remolded, to, form, new, composites, wind, farm, waste, is, less, toxic, than, other, garbage, wind, turbine, blades, represent, only, a, fraction, of, overall, waste, in, the, us, according, to, the, wind, industry, trade, association, american, wind, energy, association, several, utilities, startup, companies, and, researchers, are, developing, methods, for, reusing, or, recycling, blades, manufacturer, vestas, has, developed, technology, that, can, separate, the, fibers, from, the, resin, allowing, for, reuse, in, germany, wind, turbine, blades, are, commercially, recycled, as, part, of, an, alternative, fuel, mix, for, a, cement, factory, in, the, united, kingdom, a, project, will, trial, cutting, blades, into, strips, for, use, as, rebar, in, concrete, with, the, aim, of, reducing, emissions, in, the, construction, of, high, speed, 2, used, wind, turbine, blades, have, been, recycled, by, incorporating, them, as, part, of, the, support, structures, within, pedestrian, bridges, in, poland, and, ireland, wind, turbines, is, one, of, the, lowest, cost, sources, of, renewable, energy, along, with, solar, panels, as, technology, needed, for, wind, turbines, continued, to, improve, the, prices, decreased, as, well, in, addition, there, is, currently, no, competitive, market, for, wind, energy, though, there, may, be, in, the, future, because, wind, is, a, freely, available, natural, resource, most, of, which, is, untapped, the, main, cost, of, small, wind, turbines, is, the, purchase, and, installation, process, which, averages, between, 48, 000, and, 65, 000, per, installation, usually, the, total, amount, of, energy, harvested, amount, to, more, than, the, cost, of, the, turbines, wind, turbines, provide, a, clean, energy, source, use, little, water, emitting, no, greenhouse, gases, and, no, waste, products, during, operation, over, 1, 400, tonnes, 1, 500, short, tons, of, carbon, dioxide, per, year, can, be, eliminated, by, using, a, one, megawatt, turbine, instead, of, one, megawatt, of, energy, from, a, fossil, fuel, wind, turbines, can, be, very, large, reaching, over, 260, m, 850, ft, tall, with, blades, 110, m, 360, ft, long, and, people, have, often, complained, about, their, visual, impact, environmental, impact, of, wind, power, includes, effect, on, wildlife, but, can, be, mitigated, if, proper, strategies, are, implemented, thousands, of, birds, including, rare, species, have, been, killed, by, the, blades, of, wind, turbines, though, wind, turbines, contribute, relatively, insignificantly, to, anthropogenic, avian, mortality, wind, farms, and, nuclear, power, plants, are, responsible, for, between, 0, 3, and, 0, 4, bird, deaths, per, gigawatt, hour, gwh, of, electricity, while, fossil, fuel, power, stations, are, responsible, for, about, 5, 2, fatalities, per, gwh, in, comparison, conventional, coal, fired, generators, contribute, significantly, more, to, bird, mortality, a, study, on, recorded, bird, populations, in, the, united, states, from, 2000, to, 2020, found, the, presence, of, wind, turbines, had, no, significant, effect, on, bird, population, numbers, energy, harnessed, by, wind, turbines, is, variable, and, is, not, a, dispatchable, source, of, power, its, availability, is, based, on, whether, the, wind, is, blowing, not, whether, electricity, is, needed, turbines, can, be, placed, on, ridges, or, bluffs, to, maximize, the, access, of, wind, they, have, but, this, also, limits, the, locations, where, they, can, be, placed, in, this, way, wind, energy, is, not, a, particularly, reliable, source, of, energy, however, it, can, form, part, of, the, energy, mix, which, also, includes, power, from, other, sources, technology, is, also, being, developed, to, store, excess, energy, which, can, then, make, up, for, any, deficits, in, supplies, wind, turbines, have, blinking, lights, that, warn, aircraft, to, avoid, collisions, residents, living, near, windfarms, especially, those, in, rural, areas, have, complained, that, the, blinking, lights, are, a, bothersome, form, of, light, pollution, a, light, mitigation, approach, involves, aircraft, detection, lighting, systems, adlss, by, which, the, lights, are, turned, on, only, when, the, adls, s, radar, detects,
