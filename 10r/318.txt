heating, ventilation, and, air, conditioning, hvac, is, the, use, of, various, technologies, to, control, the, temperature, humidity, and, purity, of, the, air, in, an, enclosed, space, its, goal, is, to, provide, thermal, comfort, and, acceptable, indoor, air, quality, hvac, system, design, is, a, subdiscipline, of, mechanical, engineering, based, on, the, principles, of, thermodynamics, fluid, mechanics, and, heat, transfer, refrigeration, is, sometimes, added, to, the, field, s, abbreviation, as, hvac, r, or, hvacr, or, ventilation, is, dropped, as, in, hacr, as, in, the, designation, of, hacr, rated, circuit, breakers, hvac, is, an, important, part, of, residential, structures, such, as, single, family, homes, apartment, buildings, hotels, and, senior, living, facilities, medium, to, large, industrial, and, office, buildings, such, as, skyscrapers, and, hospitals, vehicles, such, as, cars, trains, airplanes, ships, and, submarines, and, in, marine, environments, where, safe, and, healthy, building, conditions, are, regulated, with, respect, to, temperature, and, humidity, using, fresh, air, from, outdoors, ventilating, or, ventilation, the, v, in, hvac, is, the, process, of, exchanging, or, replacing, air, in, any, space, to, provide, high, indoor, air, quality, which, involves, temperature, control, oxygen, replenishment, and, removal, of, moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne, bacteria, carbon, dioxide, and, other, gases, ventilation, removes, unpleasant, smells, and, excessive, moisture, introduces, outside, air, keeps, interior, building, air, circulating, and, prevents, stagnation, of, the, interior, air, methods, for, ventilating, a, building, are, divided, into, mechanical, forced, and, natural, types, the, three, major, functions, of, heating, ventilation, and, air, conditioning, are, interrelated, especially, with, the, need, to, provide, thermal, comfort, and, acceptable, indoor, air, quality, within, reasonable, installation, operation, and, maintenance, costs, hvac, systems, can, be, used, in, both, domestic, and, commercial, environments, hvac, systems, can, provide, ventilation, and, maintain, pressure, relationships, between, spaces, the, means, of, air, delivery, and, removal, from, spaces, is, known, as, room, air, distribution, in, modern, buildings, the, design, installation, and, control, systems, of, these, functions, are, integrated, into, one, or, more, hvac, systems, for, very, small, buildings, contractors, normally, estimate, the, capacity, and, type, of, system, needed, and, then, design, the, system, selecting, the, appropriate, refrigerant, and, various, components, needed, for, larger, buildings, building, service, designers, mechanical, engineers, or, building, services, engineers, analyze, design, and, specify, the, hvac, systems, specialty, mechanical, contractors, and, suppliers, then, fabricate, install, and, commission, the, systems, building, permits, and, code, compliance, inspections, of, the, installations, are, normally, required, for, all, sizes, of, buildings, although, hvac, is, executed, in, individual, buildings, or, other, enclosed, spaces, like, norad, s, underground, headquarters, the, equipment, involved, is, in, some, cases, an, extension, of, a, larger, district, heating, dh, or, district, cooling, dc, network, or, a, combined, dhc, network, in, such, cases, the, operating, and, maintenance, aspects, are, simplified, and, metering, becomes, necessary, to, bill, for, the, energy, that, is, consumed, and, in, some, cases, energy, that, is, returned, to, the, larger, system, for, example, at, a, given, time, one, building, may, be, utilizing, chilled, water, for, air, conditioning, and, the, warm, water, it, returns, may, be, used, in, another, building, for, heating, or, for, the, overall, heating, portion, of, the, dhc, network, likely, with, energy, added, to, boost, the, temperature, basing, hvac, on, a, larger, network, helps, provide, an, economy, of, scale, that, is, often, not, possible, for, individual, buildings, for, utilizing, renewable, energy, sources, such, as, solar, heat, winter, s, cold, the, cooling, potential, in, some, places, of, lakes, or, seawater, for, free, cooling, and, the, enabling, function, of, seasonal, thermal, energy, storage, by, utilizing, natural, sources, that, can, be, used, for, hvac, systems, it, can, make, a, huge, difference, for, the, environment, and, help, expand, the, knowledge, of, using, different, methods, hvac, is, based, on, inventions, and, discoveries, made, by, nikolay, lvov, michael, faraday, rolla, c, carpenter, willis, carrier, edwin, ruud, reuben, trane, james, joule, william, rankine, sadi, carnot, alice, parker, and, many, others, multiple, inventions, within, this, time, frame, preceded, the, beginnings, of, the, first, comfort, air, conditioning, system, which, was, designed, in, 1902, by, alfred, wolff, cooper, 2003, for, the, new, york, stock, exchange, while, willis, carrier, equipped, the, sacketts, wilhems, printing, company, with, the, process, ac, unit, the, same, year, coyne, college, was, the, first, school, to, offer, hvac, training, in, 1899, the, first, residential, ac, was, installed, by, 1914, and, by, the, 1950s, there, was, widespread, adoption, of, residential, ac, the, invention, of, the, components, of, hvac, systems, went, hand, in, hand, with, the, industrial, revolution, and, new, methods, of, modernization, higher, efficiency, and, system, control, are, constantly, being, introduced, by, companies, and, inventors, worldwide, heaters, are, appliances, whose, purpose, is, to, generate, heat, i, e, warmth, for, the, building, this, can, be, done, via, central, heating, such, a, system, contains, a, boiler, furnace, or, heat, pump, to, heat, water, steam, or, air, in, a, central, location, such, as, a, furnace, room, in, a, home, or, a, mechanical, room, in, a, large, building, the, heat, can, be, transferred, by, convection, conduction, or, radiation, space, heaters, are, used, to, heat, single, rooms, and, only, consist, of, a, single, unit, heaters, exist, for, various, types, of, fuel, including, solid, fuels, liquids, and, gases, another, type, of, heat, source, is, electricity, normally, heating, ribbons, composed, of, high, resistance, wire, see, nichrome, this, principle, is, also, used, for, baseboard, heaters, and, portable, heaters, electrical, heaters, are, often, used, as, backup, or, supplemental, heat, for, heat, pump, systems, the, heat, pump, gained, popularity, in, the, 1950s, in, japan, and, the, united, states, heat, pumps, can, extract, heat, from, various, sources, such, as, environmental, air, exhaust, air, from, a, building, or, from, the, ground, heat, pumps, transfer, heat, from, outside, the, structure, into, the, air, inside, initially, heat, pump, hvac, systems, were, only, used, in, moderate, climates, but, with, improvements, in, low, temperature, operation, and, reduced, loads, due, to, more, efficient, homes, they, are, increasing, in, popularity, in, cooler, climates, they, can, also, operate, in, reverse, to, cool, an, interior, in, the, case, of, heated, water, or, steam, piping, is, used, to, transport, the, heat, to, the, rooms, most, modern, hot, water, boiler, heating, systems, have, a, circulator, which, is, a, pump, to, move, hot, water, through, the, distribution, system, as, opposed, to, older, gravity, fed, systems, the, heat, can, be, transferred, to, the, surrounding, air, using, radiators, hot, water, coils, hydro, air, or, other, heat, exchangers, the, radiators, may, be, mounted, on, walls, or, installed, within, the, floor, to, produce, floor, heat, the, use, of, water, as, the, heat, transfer, medium, is, known, as, hydronics, the, heated, water, can, also, supply, an, auxiliary, heat, exchanger, to, supply, hot, water, for, bathing, and, washing, warm, air, systems, distribute, the, heated, air, through, ductwork, systems, of, supply, and, return, air, through, metal, or, fiberglass, ducts, many, systems, use, the, same, ducts, to, distribute, air, cooled, by, an, evaporator, coil, for, air, conditioning, the, air, supply, is, normally, filtered, through, air, filters, to, remove, dust, and, pollen, particles, the, use, of, furnaces, space, heaters, and, boilers, as, a, method, of, indoor, heating, could, result, in, incomplete, combustion, and, the, emission, of, carbon, monoxide, nitrogen, oxides, formaldehyde, volatile, organic, compounds, and, other, combustion, byproducts, incomplete, combustion, occurs, when, there, is, insufficient, oxygen, the, inputs, are, fuels, containing, various, contaminants, and, the, outputs, are, harmful, byproducts, most, dangerously, carbon, monoxide, which, is, a, tasteless, and, odorless, gas, with, serious, adverse, health, effects, without, proper, ventilation, carbon, monoxide, can, be, lethal, at, concentrations, of, 1000, ppm, 0, 1, however, at, several, hundred, ppm, carbon, monoxide, exposure, induces, headaches, fatigue, nausea, and, vomiting, carbon, monoxide, binds, with, hemoglobin, in, the, blood, forming, carboxyhemoglobin, reducing, the, blood, s, ability, to, transport, oxygen, the, primary, health, concerns, associated, with, carbon, monoxide, exposure, are, its, cardiovascular, and, neurobehavioral, effects, carbon, monoxide, can, cause, atherosclerosis, the, hardening, of, arteries, and, can, also, trigger, heart, attacks, neurologically, carbon, monoxide, exposure, reduces, hand, to, eye, coordination, vigilance, and, continuous, performance, it, can, also, affect, time, discrimination, ventilation, is, the, process, of, changing, or, replacing, air, in, any, space, to, control, the, temperature, or, remove, any, combination, of, moisture, odors, smoke, heat, dust, airborne, bacteria, or, carbon, dioxide, and, to, replenish, oxygen, ventilation, often, refers, to, the, intentional, delivery, of, the, outside, air, to, the, building, indoor, space, it, is, one, of, the, most, important, factors, for, maintaining, acceptable, indoor, air, quality, in, buildings, methods, for, ventilating, a, building, may, be, divided, into, mechanical, forced, and, natural, types, mechanical, or, forced, ventilation, is, provided, by, an, air, handler, ahu, and, used, to, control, indoor, air, quality, excess, humidity, odors, and, contaminants, can, often, be, controlled, via, dilution, or, replacement, with, outside, air, however, in, humid, climates, more, energy, is, required, to, remove, excess, moisture, from, ventilation, air, kitchens, and, bathrooms, typically, have, mechanical, exhausts, to, control, odors, and, sometimes, humidity, factors, in, the, design, of, such, systems, include, the, flow, rate, which, is, a, function, of, the, fan, speed, and, exhaust, vent, size, and, noise, level, direct, drive, fans, are, available, for, many, applications, and, can, reduce, maintenance, needs, in, summer, ceiling, fans, and, table, floor, fans, circulate, air, within, a, room, for, the, purpose, of, reducing, the, perceived, temperature, by, increasing, evaporation, of, perspiration, on, the, skin, of, the, occupants, because, hot, air, rises, ceiling, fans, may, be, used, to, keep, a, room, warmer, in, the, winter, by, circulating, the, warm, stratified, air, from, the, ceiling, to, the, floor, natural, ventilation, is, the, ventilation, of, a, building, with, outside, air, without, using, fans, or, other, mechanical, systems, it, can, be, via, operable, windows, louvers, or, trickle, vents, when, spaces, are, small, and, the, architecture, permits, ashrae, defined, natural, ventilation, as, the, flow, of, air, through, open, windows, doors, grilles, and, other, planned, building, envelope, penetrations, and, as, being, driven, by, natural, and, or, artificially, produced, pressure, differentials, in, more, complex, schemes, warm, air, is, allowed, to, rise, and, flow, out, high, building, openings, to, the, outside, stack, effect, causing, cool, outside, air, to, be, drawn, into, low, building, openings, natural, ventilation, schemes, can, use, very, little, energy, but, care, must, be, taken, to, ensure, comfort, in, warm, or, humid, climates, maintaining, thermal, comfort, solely, via, natural, ventilation, might, not, be, possible, air, conditioning, systems, are, used, either, as, backups, or, supplements, air, side, economizers, also, use, outside, air, to, condition, spaces, but, do, so, using, fans, ducts, dampers, and, control, systems, to, introduce, and, distribute, cool, outdoor, air, when, appropriate, an, important, component, of, natural, ventilation, is, air, change, rate, or, air, changes, per, hour, the, hourly, rate, of, ventilation, divided, by, the, volume, of, the, space, for, example, six, air, changes, per, hour, means, an, amount, of, new, air, equal, to, the, volume, of, the, space, is, added, every, ten, minutes, for, human, comfort, a, minimum, of, four, air, changes, per, hour, is, typical, though, warehouses, might, have, only, two, too, high, of, an, air, change, rate, may, be, uncomfortable, akin, to, a, wind, tunnel, which, has, thousands, of, changes, per, hour, the, highest, air, change, rates, are, for, crowded, spaces, bars, night, clubs, commercial, kitchens, at, around, 30, to, 50, air, changes, per, hour, room, pressure, can, be, either, positive, or, negative, with, respect, to, outside, the, room, positive, pressure, occurs, when, there, is, more, air, being, supplied, than, exhausted, and, is, common, to, reduce, the, infiltration, of, outside, contaminants, natural, ventilation, is, a, key, factor, in, reducing, the, spread, of, airborne, illnesses, such, as, tuberculosis, the, common, cold, influenza, meningitis, or, covid, 19, opening, doors, and, windows, are, good, ways, to, maximize, natural, ventilation, which, would, make, the, risk, of, airborne, contagion, much, lower, than, with, costly, and, maintenance, requiring, mechanical, systems, old, fashioned, clinical, areas, with, high, ceilings, and, large, windows, provide, the, greatest, protection, natural, ventilation, costs, little, and, is, maintenance, free, and, is, particularly, suited, to, limited, resource, settings, and, tropical, climates, where, the, burden, of, tb, and, institutional, tb, transmission, is, highest, in, settings, where, respiratory, isolation, is, difficult, and, climate, permits, windows, and, doors, should, be, opened, to, reduce, the, risk, of, airborne, contagion, natural, ventilation, requires, little, maintenance, and, is, inexpensive, natural, ventilation, is, not, practical, in, much, of, the, infrastructure, because, of, climate, this, means, that, the, facilities, need, to, have, effective, mechanical, ventilation, systems, and, or, use, ceiling, level, uv, or, far, uv, ventilation, systems, ventilation, is, measured, in, terms, of, air, changes, per, hour, ach, as, of, 2023, the, cdc, recommends, that, all, spaces, have, a, minimum, of, 5, ach, for, hospital, rooms, with, airborne, contagions, the, cdc, recommends, a, minimum, of, 12, ach, the, challenges, in, facility, ventilation, are, public, unawareness, ineffective, government, oversight, poor, building, codes, that, are, based, on, comfort, levels, poor, system, operations, poor, maintenance, and, lack, of, transparency, uvc, or, ultraviolet, germicidal, irradiation, is, a, function, used, in, modern, air, conditioners, which, reduces, airborne, viruses, bacteria, and, fungi, through, the, use, of, a, built, in, led, uv, light, like, a, vigilant, guardian, it, emits, a, gentle, glow, across, the, evaporator, ensuring, thorough, coverage, as, the, cross, flow, fan, circulates, the, room, air, any, unwelcome, viruses, are, guided, through, the, sterilization, module, s, irradiation, range, rendering, them, instantly, inactive, an, air, conditioning, system, or, a, standalone, air, conditioner, provides, cooling, and, or, humidity, control, for, all, or, part, of, a, building, air, conditioned, buildings, often, have, sealed, windows, because, open, windows, would, work, against, the, system, intended, to, maintain, constant, indoor, air, conditions, outside, fresh, air, is, generally, drawn, into, the, system, by, a, vent, into, a, mix, air, chamber, for, mixing, with, the, space, return, air, then, the, mixture, air, enters, an, indoor, or, outdoor, heat, exchanger, section, where, the, air, is, to, be, cooled, down, then, be, guided, to, the, space, creating, positive, air, pressure, the, percentage, of, return, air, made, up, of, fresh, air, can, usually, be, manipulated, by, adjusting, the, opening, of, this, vent, typical, fresh, air, intake, is, about, 10, of, the, total, supply, air, air, conditioning, and, refrigeration, are, provided, through, the, removal, of, heat, heat, can, be, removed, through, radiation, convection, or, conduction, the, heat, transfer, medium, is, a, refrigeration, system, such, as, water, air, ice, and, chemicals, are, referred, to, as, refrigerants, a, refrigerant, is, employed, either, in, a, heat, pump, system, in, which, a, compressor, is, used, to, drive, thermodynamic, refrigeration, cycle, or, in, a, free, cooling, system, that, uses, pumps, to, circulate, a, cool, refrigerant, typically, water, or, a, glycol, mix, it, is, imperative, that, the, air, conditioning, horsepower, is, sufficient, for, the, area, being, cooled, underpowered, air, conditioning, systems, will, lead, to, power, wastage, and, inefficient, usage, adequate, horsepower, is, required, for, any, air, conditioner, installed, the, refrigeration, cycle, uses, four, essential, elements, to, cool, which, are, compressor, condenser, metering, device, and, evaporator, in, variable, climates, the, system, may, include, a, reversing, valve, that, switches, from, heating, in, winter, to, cooling, in, summer, by, reversing, the, flow, of, refrigerant, the, heat, pump, refrigeration, cycle, is, changed, from, cooling, to, heating, or, vice, versa, this, allows, a, facility, to, be, heated, and, cooled, by, a, single, piece, of, equipment, by, the, same, means, and, with, the, same, hardware, free, cooling, systems, can, have, very, high, efficiencies, and, are, sometimes, combined, with, seasonal, thermal, energy, storage, so, that, the, cold, of, winter, can, be, used, for, summer, air, conditioning, common, storage, mediums, are, deep, aquifers, or, a, natural, underground, rock, mass, accessed, via, a, cluster, of, small, diameter, heat, exchanger, equipped, boreholes, some, systems, with, small, storages, are, hybrids, using, free, cooling, early, in, the, cooling, season, and, later, employing, a, heat, pump, to, chill, the, circulation, coming, from, the, storage, the, heat, pump, is, added, in, because, the, storage, acts, as, a, heat, sink, when, the, system, is, in, cooling, as, opposed, to, charging, mode, causing, the, temperature, to, gradually, increase, during, the, cooling, season, some, systems, include, an, economizer, mode, which, is, sometimes, called, a, free, cooling, mode, when, economizing, the, control, system, will, open, fully, or, partially, the, outside, air, damper, and, close, fully, or, partially, the, return, air, damper, this, will, cause, fresh, outside, air, to, be, supplied, to, the, system, when, the, outside, air, is, cooler, than, the, demanded, cool, air, this, will, allow, the, demand, to, be, met, without, using, the, mechanical, supply, of, cooling, typically, chilled, water, or, a, direct, expansion, dx, unit, thus, saving, energy, the, control, system, can, compare, the, temperature, of, the, outside, air, vs, return, air, or, it, can, compare, the, enthalpy, of, the, air, as, is, frequently, done, in, climates, where, humidity, is, more, of, an, issue, in, both, cases, the, outside, air, must, be, less, energetic, than, the, return, air, for, the, system, to, enter, the, economizer, mode, central, all, air, air, conditioning, systems, or, package, systems, with, a, combined, outdoor, condenser, evaporator, unit, are, often, installed, in, north, american, residences, offices, and, public, buildings, but, are, difficult, to, retrofit, install, in, a, building, that, was, not, designed, to, receive, it, because, of, the, bulky, air, ducts, required, minisplit, ductless, systems, are, used, in, these, situations, outside, of, north, america, packaged, systems, are, only, used, in, limited, applications, involving, large, indoor, space, such, as, stadiums, theatres, or, exhibition, halls, an, alternative, to, packaged, systems, is, the, use, of, separate, indoor, and, outdoor, coils, in, split, systems, split, systems, are, preferred, and, widely, used, worldwide, except, in, north, america, in, north, america, split, systems, are, most, often, seen, in, residential, applications, but, they, are, gaining, popularity, in, small, commercial, buildings, split, systems, are, used, where, ductwork, is, not, feasible, or, where, the, space, conditioning, efficiency, is, of, prime, concern, the, benefits, of, ductless, air, conditioning, systems, include, easy, installation, no, ductwork, greater, zonal, control, flexibility, of, control, and, quiet, operation, in, space, conditioning, the, duct, losses, can, account, for, 30, of, energy, consumption, the, use, of, minisplits, can, result, in, energy, savings, in, space, conditioning, as, there, are, no, losses, associated, with, ducting, with, the, split, system, the, evaporator, coil, is, connected, to, a, remote, condenser, unit, using, refrigerant, piping, between, an, indoor, and, outdoor, unit, instead, of, ducting, air, directly, from, the, outdoor, unit, indoor, units, with, directional, vents, mount, onto, walls, suspended, from, ceilings, or, fit, into, the, ceiling, other, indoor, units, mount, inside, the, ceiling, cavity, so, that, short, lengths, of, duct, handle, air, from, the, indoor, unit, to, vents, or, diffusers, around, the, rooms, split, systems, are, more, efficient, and, the, footprint, is, typically, smaller, than, the, package, systems, on, the, other, hand, package, systems, tend, to, have, a, slightly, lower, indoor, noise, level, compared, to, split, systems, since, the, fan, motor, is, located, outside, dehumidification, air, drying, in, an, air, conditioning, system, is, provided, by, the, evaporator, since, the, evaporator, operates, at, a, temperature, below, the, dew, point, moisture, in, the, air, condenses, on, the, evaporator, coil, tubes, this, moisture, is, collected, at, the, bottom, of, the, evaporator, in, a, pan, and, removed, by, piping, to, a, central, drain, or, onto, the, ground, outside, a, dehumidifier, is, an, air, conditioner, like, device, that, controls, the, humidity, of, a, room, or, building, it, is, often, employed, in, basements, that, have, a, higher, relative, humidity, because, of, their, lower, temperature, and, propensity, for, damp, floors, and, walls, in, food, retailing, establishments, large, open, chiller, cabinets, are, highly, effective, at, dehumidifying, the, internal, air, conversely, a, humidifier, increases, the, humidity, of, a, building, the, hvac, components, that, dehumidify, the, ventilation, air, deserve, careful, attention, because, outdoor, air, constitutes, most, of, the, annual, humidity, load, for, nearly, all, buildings, all, modern, air, conditioning, systems, even, small, window, package, units, are, equipped, with, internal, air, filters, these, are, generally, of, a, lightweight, gauze, like, material, and, must, be, replaced, or, washed, as, conditions, warrant, for, example, a, building, in, a, high, dust, environment, or, a, home, with, furry, pets, will, need, to, have, the, filters, changed, more, often, than, buildings, without, these, dirt, loads, failure, to, replace, these, filters, as, needed, will, contribute, to, a, lower, heat, exchange, rate, resulting, in, wasted, energy, shortened, equipment, life, and, higher, energy, bills, low, air, flow, can, result, in, iced, over, evaporator, coils, which, can, completely, stop, airflow, additionally, very, dirty, or, plugged, filters, can, cause, overheating, during, a, heating, cycle, which, can, result, in, damage, to, the, system, or, even, fire, because, an, air, conditioner, moves, heat, between, the, indoor, coil, and, the, outdoor, coil, both, must, be, kept, clean, this, means, that, in, addition, to, replacing, the, air, filter, at, the, evaporator, coil, it, is, also, necessary, to, regularly, clean, the, condenser, coil, failure, to, keep, the, condenser, clean, will, eventually, result, in, harm, to, the, compressor, because, the, condenser, coil, is, responsible, for, discharging, both, the, indoor, heat, as, picked, up, by, the, evaporator, and, the, heat, generated, by, the, electric, motor, driving, the, compressor, hvac, is, significantly, responsible, for, promoting, energy, efficiency, of, buildings, as, the, building, sector, consumes, the, largest, percentage, of, global, energy, since, the, 1980s, manufacturers, of, hvac, equipment, have, been, making, an, effort, to, make, the, systems, they, manufacture, more, efficient, this, was, originally, driven, by, rising, energy, costs, and, has, more, recently, been, driven, by, increased, awareness, of, environmental, issues, additionally, improvements, to, the, hvac, system, efficiency, can, also, help, increase, occupant, health, and, productivity, in, the, us, the, epa, has, imposed, tighter, restrictions, over, the, years, there, are, several, methods, for, making, hvac, systems, more, efficient, in, the, past, water, heating, was, more, efficient, for, heating, buildings, and, was, the, standard, in, the, united, states, today, forced, air, systems, can, double, for, air, conditioning, and, are, more, popular, some, benefits, of, forced, air, systems, which, are, now, widely, used, in, churches, schools, and, high, end, residences, are, a, drawback, is, the, installation, cost, which, can, be, slightly, higher, than, traditional, hvac, systems, energy, efficiency, can, be, improved, even, more, in, central, heating, systems, by, introducing, zoned, heating, this, allows, a, more, granular, application, of, heat, similar, to, non, central, heating, systems, zones, are, controlled, by, multiple, thermostats, in, water, heating, systems, the, thermostats, control, zone, valves, and, in, forced, air, systems, they, control, zone, dampers, inside, the, vents, which, selectively, block, the, flow, of, air, in, this, case, the, control, system, is, very, critical, to, maintaining, a, proper, temperature, forecasting, is, another, method, of, controlling, building, heating, by, calculating, the, demand, for, heating, energy, that, should, be, supplied, to, the, building, in, each, time, unit, ground, source, or, geothermal, heat, pumps, are, similar, to, ordinary, heat, pumps, but, instead, of, transferring, heat, to, or, from, outside, air, they, rely, on, the, stable, even, temperature, of, the, earth, to, provide, heating, and, air, conditioning, many, regions, experience, seasonal, temperature, extremes, which, would, require, large, capacity, heating, and, cooling, equipment, to, heat, or, cool, buildings, for, example, a, conventional, heat, pump, system, used, to, heat, a, building, in, montana, s, 57, c, 70, f, low, temperature, or, cool, a, building, in, the, highest, temperature, ever, recorded, in, the, us, 57, c, 134, f, in, death, valley, california, in, 1913, would, require, a, large, amount, of, energy, due, to, the, extreme, difference, between, inside, and, outside, air, temperatures, a, metre, below, the, earth, s, surface, however, the, ground, remains, at, a, relatively, constant, temperature, utilizing, this, large, source, of, relatively, moderate, temperature, earth, a, heating, or, cooling, system, s, capacity, can, often, be, significantly, reduced, although, ground, temperatures, vary, according, to, latitude, at, 1, 8, metres, 6, ft, underground, temperatures, generally, only, range, from, 7, to, 24, c, 45, to, 75, f, photovoltaic, solar, panels, offer, a, new, way, to, potentially, decrease, the, operating, cost, of, air, conditioning, traditional, air, conditioners, run, using, alternating, current, and, hence, any, direct, current, solar, power, needs, to, be, inverted, to, be, compatible, with, these, units, new, variable, speed, dc, motor, units, allow, solar, power, to, more, easily, run, them, since, this, conversion, is, unnecessary, and, since, the, motors, are, tolerant, of, voltage, fluctuations, associated, with, variance, in, supplied,
