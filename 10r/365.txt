a, knot, is, an, intentional, complication, in, cordage, which, may, be, practical, or, decorative, or, both, practical, knots, are, classified, by, function, including, hitches, bends, loop, knots, and, splices, a, hitch, fastens, a, rope, to, another, object, a, bend, fastens, two, ends, of, a, rope, to, each, another, a, loop, knot, is, any, knot, creating, a, loop, and, splice, denotes, any, multi, strand, knot, including, bends, and, loops, a, knot, may, also, refer, in, the, strictest, sense, to, a, stopper, or, knob, at, the, end, of, a, rope, to, keep, that, end, from, slipping, through, a, grommet, or, eye, knots, have, excited, interest, since, ancient, times, for, their, practical, uses, as, well, as, their, topological, intricacy, studied, in, the, area, of, mathematics, known, as, knot, theory, knots, and, knotting, have, been, used, and, studied, throughout, history, for, example, chinese, knotting, is, a, decorative, handicraft, art, that, began, as, a, form, of, chinese, folk, art, in, the, tang, and, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, ad, in, china, later, popularized, in, the, ming, knot, theory, is, the, recent, mathematical, study, of, knots, knots, of, ancient, origin, include, the, bottle, sling, bowline, cat, s, paw, clove, hitch, cow, hitch, double, fisherman, s, knot, eskimo, bowline, figure, eight, knot, fisherman, s, knot, half, hitch, kalmyk, loop, one, sided, overhand, bend, overhand, knot, overhand, loop, reef, knot, running, bowline, single, hitch, thief, knot, turk, s, head, knot, and, two, half, hitches, the, eleven, main, knots, of, chinese, knotting, are, the, four, flower, knot, six, flower, knot, chinese, button, knot, double, connection, knot, double, coin, knot, agemaki, cross, knot, square, knot, plafond, knot, pan, chang, knot, and, the, good, luck, knot, knots, of, more, recent, origin, include, the, friendship, knot, of, chinese, knotting, the, sheepshank, knot, originates, from, 1627, while, the, western, union, splice, originates, from, the, beginning, of, telegraphy, there, is, a, large, variety, of, knots, each, with, properties, that, make, it, suitable, for, a, range, of, tasks, some, knots, are, used, to, attach, the, rope, or, other, knotting, material, to, other, objects, such, as, another, rope, cleat, ring, or, stake, some, knots, are, used, to, bind, or, constrict, objects, decorative, knots, usually, bind, to, themselves, to, produce, attractive, patterns, while, some, people, can, look, at, diagrams, or, photos, and, tie, the, illustrated, knots, others, learn, best, by, watching, how, a, knot, is, tied, knot, tying, skills, are, often, transmitted, by, sailors, scouts, climbers, canyoners, cavers, arborists, rescue, professionals, stagehands, fishermen, linemen, and, surgeons, the, international, guild, of, knot, tyers, is, an, organization, dedicated, to, the, promotion, of, knot, tying, truckers, in, need, of, securing, a, load, may, use, a, trucker, s, hitch, gaining, mechanical, advantage, knots, can, save, spelunkers, from, being, buried, under, rock, many, knots, can, also, be, used, as, makeshift, tools, for, example, the, bowline, can, be, used, as, a, rescue, loop, and, the, munter, hitch, can, be, used, for, belaying, the, diamond, hitch, was, widely, used, to, tie, packages, on, to, donkeys, and, mules, in, hazardous, environments, such, as, mountains, knots, are, very, important, in, the, event, of, someone, falling, into, a, ravine, or, a, similar, terrain, feature, with, the, correct, equipment, and, knowledge, of, knots, a, rappel, system, can, be, set, up, to, lower, a, rescuer, down, to, a, casualty, and, set, up, a, hauling, system, to, allow, a, third, individual, to, pull, both, the, rescuer, and, the, casualty, out, of, the, ravine, further, application, of, knots, includes, developing, a, high, line, which, is, similar, to, a, zip, line, and, which, can, be, used, to, move, supplies, injured, people, or, the, untrained, across, rivers, crevices, or, ravines, note, the, systems, mentioned, typically, require, carabiners, and, the, use, of, multiple, appropriate, knots, these, knots, include, the, bowline, double, figure, eight, munter, hitch, munter, mule, prusik, autoblock, and, clove, hitch, thus, any, individual, who, goes, into, a, mountainous, environment, should, have, basic, knowledge, of, knots, and, knot, systems, to, increase, safety, and, the, ability, to, undertake, activities, such, as, rappelling, knots, can, be, applied, in, combination, to, produce, complex, objects, such, as, lanyards, and, netting, in, ropework, the, frayed, end, of, a, rope, is, held, together, by, a, type, of, knot, called, a, whipping, knot, many, types, of, textiles, use, knots, to, repair, damage, macram, one, kind, of, textile, is, generated, exclusively, through, the, use, of, knotting, instead, of, knits, crochets, weaves, or, felting, macram, can, produce, self, supporting, three, dimensional, textile, structures, as, well, as, flat, work, and, is, often, used, ornamentally, or, decoratively, knots, weaken, the, rope, in, which, they, are, made, when, knotted, rope, is, strained, to, its, breaking, point, it, almost, always, fails, at, the, knot, or, close, to, it, unless, it, is, defective, or, damaged, elsewhere, the, bending, crushing, and, chafing, forces, that, hold, a, knot, in, place, also, unevenly, stress, rope, fibers, and, ultimately, lead, to, a, reduction, in, strength, the, exact, mechanisms, that, cause, the, weakening, and, failure, are, complex, and, are, the, subject, of, continued, study, special, fibers, that, show, differences, in, color, in, response, to, strain, are, being, developed, and, used, to, study, stress, as, it, relates, to, types, of, knots, relative, knot, strength, also, called, knot, efficiency, is, the, breaking, strength, of, a, knotted, rope, in, proportion, to, the, breaking, strength, of, the, rope, without, the, knot, determining, a, precise, value, for, a, particular, knot, is, difficult, because, many, factors, can, affect, a, knot, efficiency, test, the, type, of, fiber, the, style, of, rope, the, size, of, rope, whether, it, is, wet, or, dry, how, the, knot, is, dressed, before, loading, how, rapidly, it, is, loaded, whether, the, knot, is, repeatedly, loaded, and, so, on, the, efficiency, of, common, knots, ranges, between, 40, and, 80, of, the, rope, s, original, strength, in, most, situations, forming, loops, and, bends, with, conventional, knots, is, far, more, practical, than, using, rope, splices, even, though, the, latter, can, maintain, nearly, the, rope, s, full, strength, prudent, users, allow, for, a, large, safety, margin, in, the, strength, of, rope, chosen, for, a, task, due, to, the, weakening, effects, of, knots, aging, damage, shock, loading, etc, the, working, load, limit, of, a, rope, is, generally, specified, with, a, significant, safety, factor, up, to, 15, 1, for, critical, applications, for, life, threatening, applications, other, factors, come, into, play, even, if, the, rope, does, not, break, a, knot, may, still, fail, to, hold, knots, that, hold, firm, under, a, variety, of, adverse, conditions, are, said, to, be, more, secure, than, those, that, do, not, the, following, sections, describe, the, main, ways, that, knots, fail, to, hold, the, load, creates, tension, that, pulls, the, rope, back, through, the, knot, in, the, direction, of, the, load, if, this, continues, far, enough, the, working, end, passes, into, the, knot, and, the, knot, unravels, and, fails, this, behavior, can, worsen, when, the, knot, is, repeatedly, strained, and, let, slack, dragged, over, rough, terrain, or, repeatedly, struck, against, hard, objects, such, as, masts, and, flagpoles, even, with, secure, knots, slippage, may, occur, when, the, knot, is, first, put, under, real, tension, this, can, be, mitigated, by, leaving, plenty, of, rope, at, the, working, end, outside, of, the, knot, and, by, dressing, the, knot, cleanly, and, tightening, it, as, much, as, possible, before, loading, sometimes, the, use, of, a, stopper, knot, or, even, better, a, backup, knot, can, prevent, the, working, end, from, passing, through, the, knot, but, if, a, knot, is, observed, to, slip, it, is, generally, preferable, to, use, a, more, secure, knot, life, critical, applications, often, require, backup, knots, to, maximize, safety, to, capsize, or, spill, a, knot, is, to, change, its, form, and, rearrange, its, parts, usually, by, pulling, on, specific, ends, in, certain, ways, when, used, inappropriately, some, knots, tend, to, capsize, easily, or, even, spontaneously, often, the, capsized, form, of, the, knot, offers, little, resistance, to, slipping, or, unraveling, a, reef, knot, when, misused, as, a, bend, can, capsize, dangerously, sometimes, a, knot, is, intentionally, capsized, as, a, method, of, tying, another, knot, as, with, the, lightning, method, of, tying, a, bowline, some, knots, such, as, the, carrick, bend, are, generally, tied, in, one, form, then, capsized, to, obtain, a, stronger, or, more, stable, form, in, knots, that, are, meant, to, grip, other, objects, failure, can, be, defined, as, the, knot, moving, relative, to, the, gripped, object, while, the, knot, itself, is, not, untied, it, ceases, to, perform, the, desired, function, for, instance, a, simple, rolling, hitch, tied, around, a, railing, and, pulled, parallel, to, the, railing, might, hold, up, to, a, certain, tension, then, start, sliding, sometimes, this, problem, can, be, corrected, by, working, up, the, knot, tighter, before, subjecting, it, to, load, but, usually, the, problem, requires, either, a, knot, with, more, wraps, or, a, rope, of, different, diameter, or, material, knots, differ, in, the, effort, required, to, untie, them, after, loading, knots, that, are, very, difficult, to, untie, such, as, the, water, knot, are, said, to, jam, or, be, jamming, knots, knots, that, come, untied, with, less, difficulty, such, as, the, zeppelin, bend, are, referred, to, as, non, jamming, the, list, of, knots, is, extensive, but, common, properties, allow, for, a, useful, system, of, categorization, for, example, loop, knots, share, the, attribute, of, having, some, kind, of, an, anchor, point, constructed, on, the, standing, end, such, as, a, loop, or, overhand, knot, into, which, the, working, end, is, easily, hitched, using, a, round, turn, an, example, of, this, is, the, bowline, constricting, knots, often, rely, on, friction, to, cinch, down, tight, on, loose, bundles, an, example, is, the, miller, s, knot, knots, may, belong, to, more, than, one, category, trick, knots, are, knots, that, are, used, as, part, of, a, magic, trick, a, joke, or, a, puzzle, they, are, useful, for, these, purposes, because, they, have, a, deceptive, appearance, being, easier, or, more, difficult, to, tie, or, untie, than, their, appearance, would, suggest, the, easiest, trick, knot, is, the, slip, knot, other, noted, trick, knots, include, coxcombing, is, a, decorative, knotwork, performed, by, sailors, during, the, age, of, sail, the, general, purpose, was, to, dress, up, protect, or, help, identify, specific, items, and, parts, of, ships, and, boats, it, is, still, found, today, in, some, whippings, and, wrappings, of, small, diameter, line, on, boat, tillers, and, ships, wheels, to, enhance, the, grip, or, to, identify, rudder, amidships, knots, used, in, coxcombing, include, turk, s, head, knot, flemish, french, whipping, and, others, knot, theory, is, a, branch, of, topology, it, deals, with, the, mathematical, analysis, of, knots, their, structure, and, properties, and, with, the, relationships, between, different, knots, in, topology, a, knot, is, a, figure, consisting, of, a, single, loop, with, any, number, of, crossing, or, knotted, elements, a, closed, curve, in, space, which, may, be, moved, around, so, long, as, its, strands, never, pass, through, each, other, as, a, closed, loop, a, mathematical, knot, has, no, proper, ends, and, cannot, be, undone, or, untied, however, any, physical, knot, in, a, piece, of, string, can, be, thought, of, as, a, mathematical, knot, by, fusing, the, two, ends, a, configuration, of, several, knots, winding, around, each, other, is, called, a, link, various, mathematical, techniques, are, used, to, classify, and, distinguish, knots, and, links, for, instance, the, alexander, polynomial, associates, certain, numbers, with, any, given, knot, these, numbers, are, different, for, the, trefoil, knot, the, figure, eight, knot, and, the, unknot, a, simple, loop, showing, that, one, cannot, be, moved, into, the, other, without, strands, passing, through, each, other, a, simple, mathematical, theory, of, hitches, has, been, proposed, by, bayman, and, extended, by, maddocks, and, keller, it, makes, predictions, that, are, approximately, correct, when, tested, empirically, no, similarly, successful, theory, has, been, developed, for, knots, in, general, knot, tying, consists, of, the, techniques, and, skills, employed, in, tying, a, knot, in, rope, nylon, webbing, or, other, articles, the, proper, tying, of, a, knot, can, be, the, difference, between, an, attractive, knot, and, a, messy, one, and, occasionally, life, and, death, it, is, important, to, understand, the, often, subtle, differences, between, what, works, and, what, does, not, for, example, many, knots, spill, or, pull, through, particularly, if, they, are, not, backed, up, usually, with, a, single, or, double, overhand, knot, to, make, sure, the, end, of, the, rope, does, not, make, its, way, through, the, main, knot, causing, all, strength, to, be, lost, the, tying, of, a, knot, may, be, very, straightforward, such, as, with, an, overhand, knot, or, it, may, be, more, complicated, such, as, a, monkey, s, fist, knot, tying, knots, correctly, requires, an, understanding, of, the, type, of, material, being, tied, string, cord, monofilament, line, kernmantle, rope, or, nylon, webbing, for, example, cotton, string, may, be, very, small, and, easy, to, tie, with, much, internal, friction, to, keep, it, from, falling, apart, once, tied, while, stiff, 5, 8, thick, kernmantle, rope, will, be, very, difficult, to, tie, and, may, be, so, slick, as, to, tend, to, come, apart, once, tied, the, form, of, the, material, will, influence, the, tying, of, a, knot, as, well, rope, is, round, in, cross, section, and, has, little, dependence, upon, the, manner, in, which, the, material, is, tied, nylon, webbing, on, the, other, hand, is, flat, and, usually, tubular, in, construction, meaning, that, it, is, spiral, woven, and, has, a, hollow, core, in, order, to, retain, as, much, of, the, strength, as, possible, with, webbing, the, material, must, be, tied, flat, such, that, parallel, sections, do, not, cross, and, that, the, sections, of, webbing, are, not, twisted, when, they, cross, each, other, within, a, knot, the, crossing, of, strands, is, important, when, dealing, with, round, rope, in, other, knots, for, example, the, figure, eight, loop, loses, strength, when, strands, are, crossed, while, the, knot, is, being, finished, and, tightened, moreover, the, standing, end, or, the, end, from, which, the, hauling, will, be, done, must, have, the, greater, radius, of, curvature, in, the, finished, knot, to, maximize, the, strength, of, the, knot, tools, are, sometimes, employed, in, the, finishing, or, untying, of, a, knot, such, as, a, fid, a, tapered, piece, of, wood, that, is, often, used, in, splicing, with, the, advent, of, wire, rope, many, other, tools, are, used, in, the, tying, of, knots, however, for, cordage, and, other, non, metallic, appliances, the, tools, used, are, generally, limited, to, sharp, edges, or, blades, such, as, a, sheepsfoot, blade, occasionally, a, fine, needle, for, proper, whipping, of, laid, rope, a, hot, cutter, for, nylon, and, other, synthetic, fibers, and, for, larger, ropes, a, shoe, for, smoothing, out, large, knots, by, rolling, them, on, the, ground, the, hagfish, is, known, to, strip, slime, from, its, skin, by, tying, itself, into, a, simple, overhand, knot, and, moving, its, body, to, make, the, knot, travel, toward, the, tail, it, also, uses, this, action, in, reverse, tail, to, head, to, pry, out, flesh, after, biting, into, a, carcass
