spinning, is, an, ancient, textile, art, in, which, plant, animal, or, synthetic, fibres, are, drawn, out, and, twisted, together, to, form, yarn, for, thousands, of, years, fibre, was, spun, by, hand, using, simple, tools, the, spindle, and, distaff, after, the, introduction, of, the, spinning, wheel, in, the, 13th, century, the, output, of, individual, spinners, increased, dramatically, mass, production, later, arose, in, the, 18th, century, with, the, beginnings, of, the, industrial, revolution, hand, spinning, remains, a, popular, handicraft, characteristics, of, spun, yarn, vary, according, to, the, material, used, fibre, length, and, alignment, quantity, of, fibre, used, and, degree, of, twist, the, origins, of, spinning, fibre, to, make, string, or, yarn, are, lost, in, time, but, archaeological, evidence, in, the, form, of, representation, of, string, skirts, has, been, dated, to, the, upper, paleolithic, era, some, 20, 000, years, ago, there, has, also, been, recent, discovery, of, plied, cord, spun, by, neanderthals, and, dating, back, 41, 000, 52, 000, years, in, the, earliest, type, of, spinning, tufts, of, animal, hair, or, plant, fibre, are, rolled, down, the, thigh, with, the, hand, and, additional, tufts, are, added, as, needed, until, the, desired, length, of, spun, fibre, is, achieved, an, advanced, technique, of, thigh, spinning, while, simultaneously, plying, two, singles, is, still, used, today, in, several, cultures, such, as, with, chilkat, weaving, and, ravenstail, weaving, in, earlier, practice, of, thigh, spinning, the, fibre, might, be, fastened, to, a, stone, which, is, twirled, round, until, the, yarn, is, sufficiently, twisted, whereupon, it, is, wound, upon, the, stone, and, the, process, repeated, over, and, over, the, next, method, of, spinning, yarn, is, with, the, spindle, a, straight, stick, eight, to, twelve, inches, long, on, which, the, yarn, is, wound, after, twisting, at, first, the, stick, had, a, cleft, or, split, in, the, top, in, which, the, thread, was, fixed, later, a, hook, of, bone, was, added, to, the, upper, end, the, bunch, of, wool, or, plant, fibres, is, held, in, the, left, hand, with, the, right, hand, the, fibres, are, drawn, out, several, inches, and, the, end, fastened, securely, in, the, slit, or, hook, on, the, top, of, the, spindle, a, whirling, motion, is, given, to, the, spindle, on, the, thigh, or, any, convenient, part, of, the, body, the, twisted, yarn, is, then, wound, on, to, the, upper, part, of, the, spindle, another, bunch, of, fibres, is, drawn, out, the, spindle, is, given, another, twirl, the, yarn, is, wound, on, the, spindle, and, so, on, the, distaff, was, used, for, holding, the, bunch, of, wool, flax, or, other, fibres, it, was, a, short, stick, on, one, end, of, which, was, loosely, wound, the, raw, material, the, other, end, of, the, distaff, was, held, in, the, hand, under, the, arm, or, thrust, in, the, girdle, of, the, spinner, when, held, thus, one, hand, was, left, free, for, drawing, out, the, fibres, a, spindle, containing, a, quantity, of, yarn, rotates, more, easily, steadily, and, continues, longer, than, an, empty, one, hence, the, next, improvement, was, the, addition, of, a, weight, called, a, spindle, whorl, at, the, bottom, of, the, spindle, these, whorls, are, discs, of, wood, stone, clay, or, metal, with, a, hole, in, the, centre, for, the, spindle, which, keep, the, spindle, steady, and, promote, its, rotation, spindle, whorls, appeared, in, the, neolithic, era, they, allowed, the, spinner, to, slowly, lower, or, drop, the, spindle, as, it, was, spinning, thus, allowing, a, greater, quantity, of, yarn, to, be, made, before, it, had, to, be, wound, onto, the, spindle, hence, the, name, drop, spindle, which, is, now, most, commonly, used, for, the, hand, spindle, with, whorl, attached, the, scottish, drop, spindle, is, called, fairsaid, farsadh, or, dealgan, the, spinning, wheel, was, possibly, invented, in, the, islamic, world, by, 1030, it, later, spread, to, china, by, 1090, and, then, spread, from, the, islamic, world, to, europe, and, india, by, the, 13th, century, in, medieval, times, poor, families, had, such, a, need, for, yarn, to, make, their, own, cloth, and, clothes, that, practically, all, girls, and, unmarried, women, would, keep, busy, spinning, and, spinster, became, synonymous, with, an, unmarried, woman, subsequent, improvements, with, spinning, wheels, and, then, mechanical, methods, made, hand, spinning, increasingly, uneconomic, but, as, late, as, the, twentieth, century, hand, spinning, remained, widespread, in, poor, countries, in, conscious, rejection, of, international, industrialization, gandhi, was, a, notable, practitioner, the, hand, spinning, movement, that, he, initiated, as, a, part, of, the, indian, freedom, struggle, has, made, the, handwoven, cloth, known, as, khadi, made, from, handspun, cotton, yarn, world, famous, women, spinners, of, cotton, yarn, still, continue, to, work, to, produce, handspun, yarn, for, the, weaving, of, khadi, in, ponduru, a, village, in, south, india, a, great, wheel, also, called, a, wool, wheel, high, wheel, or, walking, wheel, is, advantageous, when, using, the, long, draw, technique, to, spin, wool, or, cotton, because, the, high, ratio, between, the, large, wheel, and, the, whorl, sheave, enables, the, spinner, to, turn, the, bobbin, faster, thus, significantly, speeding, up, production, a, saxony, wheel, also, called, a, flax, wheel, or, an, upright, wheel, also, called, a, castle, wheel, is, invaluable, when, spinning, flax, to, make, linen, the, ends, of, flax, fibres, tend, to, stick, out, from, the, thread, unless, wetted, while, being, spun, so, the, spinner, usually, keeps, a, bowl, of, water, handy, when, spinning, flax, on, these, types, of, wheels, both, hands, are, free, as, the, wheel, is, turned, with, a, treadle, rather, than, by, hand, so, the, spinner, can, use, one, hand, to, draft, the, fibres, and, the, other, to, wet, them, these, wheels, can, also, be, used, to, spin, wool, or, cotton, powered, spinning, originally, done, by, water, or, steam, power, but, now, done, by, electricity, is, vastly, faster, than, hand, spinning, the, spinning, jenny, a, multi, spool, spinning, wheel, invented, c, 1764, by, james, hargreaves, dramatically, reduced, the, amount, of, work, needed, to, produce, yarn, of, high, consistency, with, a, single, worker, able, to, work, eight, or, more, spools, at, once, at, roughly, the, same, time, richard, arkwright, and, a, team, of, craftsmen, developed, the, spinning, frame, which, produced, a, stronger, thread, than, the, spinning, jenny, too, large, to, be, operated, by, hand, a, spinning, frame, powered, by, a, waterwheel, became, the, water, frame, in, 1779, samuel, crompton, combined, elements, of, the, spinning, jenny, and, water, frame, to, create, the, spinning, mule, this, produced, a, stronger, thread, and, was, suitable, for, mechanisation, on, a, grand, scale, a, later, development, from, 1828, 29, was, ring, spinning, in, the, 20th, century, new, techniques, including, open, end, spinning, or, rotor, spinning, were, invented, to, produce, yarns, at, rates, in, excess, of, 40, meters, per, second, yarn, can, be, and, is, spun, from, a, wide, variety, of, materials, including, natural, fibres, such, as, animal, plant, and, mineral, fibres, and, synthetic, fibres, the, direction, in, which, the, yarn, is, spun, is, called, twist, yarns, are, characterized, as, s, twist, or, z, twist, according, to, the, direction, of, spinning, see, diagram, tightness, of, twist, is, measured, in, tpi, twists, per, inch, or, turns, per, inch, two, or, more, spun, yarns, may, be, twisted, together, or, plied, to, form, a, thicker, yarn, generally, handspun, single, plies, are, spun, with, a, z, twist, and, plying, is, done, with, an, s, twist, this, is, a, cultural, preference, differing, in, some, areas, but, surprisingly, common, it, is, important, however, to, spin, the, single, plies, in, one, direction, and, then, spin, them, together, in, the, opposite, direction, in, this, way, the, opposite, direction, plying, keeps, the, spun, yarn, from, untwisting, itself, yarns, can, be, made, of, two, three, four, or, more, plies, or, may, be, used, as, singles, without, plying, two, ply, yarn, can, also, be, plied, from, both, ends, of, one, long, strand, of, singles, using, a, centre, pull, ball, where, one, end, feeds, from, within, a, ball, of, yarn, while, the, other, end, feeds, from, the, outside, andean, plying, in, which, the, single, is, first, wound, around, one, hand, in, a, specific, manner, that, allows, unwinding, both, ends, at, once, without, tangling, is, another, way, to, ply, smaller, amounts, of, yarn, the, name, comes, from, a, method, used, by, andean, spinners, to, manage, and, splice, unevenly, matched, singles, being, plied, from, multiple, spindles, navajo, plying, a, k, a, chain, plying, is, another, method, of, producing, a, three, ply, yarn, in, which, one, strand, of, singles, is, looped, around, itself, in, a, manner, similar, to, crochet, and, the, resulting, three, parallel, strands, twisted, together, this, method, is, often, used, to, keep, colours, together, on, singles, dyed, in, sequential, colours, cabled, yarns, are, usually, four, ply, yarns, made, by, plying, two, strands, of, two, ply, yarn, together, in, the, direction, opposite, to, the, plying, direction, for, the, two, ply, yarns, hand, spinning, is, still, an, important, skill, in, many, traditional, societies, hobby, or, small, scale, artisan, spinners, spin, their, own, yarn, to, control, specific, yarn, qualities, and, produce, yarn, that, is, not, widely, available, commercially, sometimes, these, yarns, are, made, available, to, non, spinners, online, and, in, local, yarn, stores, handspinners, also, may, spin, for, self, sufficiency, a, sense, of, accomplishment, or, a, sense, of, connection, to, history, and, the, land, in, addition, they, may, take, up, spinning, for, its, meditative, qualities, within, the, recent, past, many, new, spinners, have, joined, into, this, ancient, process, innovating, the, craft, and, creating, new, techniques, from, using, new, dyeing, methods, before, spinning, to, mixing, in, novelty, elements, christmas, garland, eccentric, beads, money, etc, that, would, not, normally, be, found, in, traditional, yarns, to, creating, and, employing, new, techniques, like, coiling, this, craft, is, constantly, evolving, and, shifting, to, make, various, yarns, besides, adding, novelty, elements, spinners, can, vary, all, the, same, things, as, in, a, machined, yarn, i, e, the, fibre, the, preparation, the, colour, the, spinning, technique, the, direction, of, the, twist, etc, a, common, misconception, is, that, yarn, spun, from, rolags, may, not, be, as, strong, but, the, strength, of, a, yarn, is, actually, based, on, the, length, of, hair, fibre, and, the, degree, of, twist, when, working, with, shorter, hairs, such, as, from, llama, or, angora, rabbit, the, spinner, may, choose, to, integrate, longer, fibres, such, as, mohair, to, prevent, yarn, breakage, yarns, made, of, shorter, fibres, are, also, given, more, twist, than, yarns, of, longer, fibres, and, are, generally, spun, with, the, short, draw, technique, the, fibre, can, be, dyed, at, any, time, but, is, often, dyed, before, carding, or, after, the, yarn, has, been, spun, wool, may, be, spun, before, or, after, washing, although, excessive, amounts, of, lanolin, may, make, spinning, difficult, especially, when, using, a, drop, spindle, careless, washing, may, cause, felting, when, done, prior, to, spinning, this, often, leads, to, unusable, wool, fibre, in, washing, wool, the, key, thing, to, avoid, is, too, much, agitation, and, fast, temperature, changes, from, hot, to, cold, generally, washing, is, done, lock, by, lock, in, warm, water, with, dish, soap, there, are, number, of, guilds, and, educational, institutions, which, offer, certificate, programs, in, handspinning, the, handweavers, guild, of, america, hga, offers, a, certificate, of, excellence, in, handspinning, olds, college, in, alberta, canada, offers, a, master, spinner, program, both, on, campus, and, by, distance, education, the, ontario, handweavers, spinners, offer, both, a, spinning, certificate, and, a, master, spinning, certificate, these, programs, feature, in, depth, examinations, of, handspinning, topics, as, well, as, extensive, assignments, and, skill, evaluations, a, tightly, spun, wool, yarn, made, from, fibre, with, a, long, staple, length, in, it, is, called, worsted, it, is, hand, spun, from, combed, top, and, the, fibres, all, lie, in, the, same, direction, as, the, yarn, a, woollen, yarn, in, contrast, is, hand, spun, from, a, rolag, or, other, carded, fibre, roving, batts, where, the, fibres, are, not, as, strictly, aligned, to, the, yarn, created, the, woollen, yarn, thus, captures, much, more, air, and, makes, for, a, softer, and, generally, bulkier, yarn, there, are, two, main, techniques, to, create, these, different, yarns, short, draw, creates, worsted, yarns, and, long, draw, creates, woollen, yarns, often, a, spinner, will, spin, using, a, combination, of, both, techniques, and, thus, make, a, semi, worsted, yarn, short, draw, spinning, is, used, to, create, worsted, yarns, it, is, spun, from, combed, roving, sliver, or, wool, top, the, spinner, keeps, his, her, hands, very, close, to, each, other, the, fibres, are, held, fanned, out, in, one, hand, and, the, other, hand, pulls, a, small, number, from, the, mass, the, twist, is, kept, between, the, second, hand, and, the, wheel, there, is, never, any, twist, between, the, two, hands, long, draw, is, spun, from, a, carded, rolag, the, rolag, is, spun, without, much, stretching, of, the, fibres, from, the, cylindrical, configuration, this, is, done, by, allowing, twist, into, a, short, section, of, the, rolag, and, then, pulling, back, without, letting, the, rolag, change, position, in, one, s, hands, until, the, yarn, is, the, desired, thickness, the, twist, will, concentrate, in, the, thinnest, part, of, the, roving, thus, when, the, yarn, is, pulled, the, thicker, sections, with, less, twist, will, tend, to, thin, out, once, the, yarn, is, the, desired, thickness, enough, twist, is, added, to, make, the, yarn, strong, then, the, yarn, is, wound, onto, the, bobbin, and, the, process, starts, again, handspinners, are, split, when, spinning, wool, as, to, whether, it, is, better, to, spin, it, in, the, grease, with, lanolin, still, in, or, after, it, has, been, washed, more, traditional, spinners, are, more, willing, to, spin, in, the, grease, as, it, is, less, work, to, wash, the, wool, after, it, is, in, yarn, form, spinners, who, spin, very, fine, yarn, may, also, prefer, to, spin, in, the, grease, as, it, can, allow, them, to, spin, finer, yarns, with, more, ease, spinning, in, the, grease, covers, the, spinner, s, hands, in, lanolin, and, thus, softens, the, spinner, s, hands, spinning, in, the, grease, works, best, if, the, fleece, is, newly, sheared, after, several, months, the, lanolin, becomes, sticky, which, makes, the, wool, harder, to, spin, using, the, short, draw, technique, and, almost, impossible, to, spin, using, the, long, draw, technique, in, general, spinners, who, use, the, long, draw, technique, do, not, spin, in, the, grease, such, spinners, generally, buy, their, fibres, pre, washed, and, carded, in, the, form, of, roving, sliver, or, batts, this, means, less, work, for, the, spinners, as, they, do, not, have, to, wash, out, the, lanolin, spinners, then, have, available, predyed, fibre, or, blends, of, fibres, which, are, hard, to, create, when, the, wool, is, still, in, the, grease, as, machine, carders, cannot, card, wool, in, the, grease, pre, carded, yarn, generally, is, not, spun, in, the, grease, some, spinners, use, spray, on, lanolin, like, products, to, get, the, same, feel, of, spinning, in, the, grease, with, carded, fibre
