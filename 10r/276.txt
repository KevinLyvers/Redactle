a, ceiling, s, i, l, is, an, overhead, interior, roof, that, covers, the, upper, limits, of, a, room, it, is, not, generally, considered, a, structural, element, but, a, finished, surface, concealing, the, underside, of, the, roof, structure, or, the, floor, of, a, story, above, ceilings, can, be, decorated, to, taste, and, there, are, many, examples, of, frescoes, and, artwork, on, ceilings, especially, within, religious, buildings, a, ceiling, can, also, be, the, upper, limit, of, a, tunnel, the, most, common, type, of, ceiling, is, the, dropped, ceiling, which, is, suspended, from, structural, elements, above, panels, of, drywall, are, fastened, either, directly, to, the, ceiling, joists, or, to, a, few, layers, of, moisture, proof, plywood, which, are, then, attached, to, the, joists, pipework, or, ducts, can, be, run, in, the, gap, above, the, ceiling, and, insulation, and, fireproofing, material, can, be, placed, here, alternatively, ceilings, may, be, spray, painted, instead, leaving, the, pipework, and, ducts, exposed, but, painted, and, using, spray, foam, a, subset, of, the, dropped, ceiling, is, the, suspended, ceiling, wherein, a, network, of, aluminum, struts, as, opposed, to, drywall, are, attached, to, the, joists, forming, a, series, of, rectangular, spaces, individual, pieces, of, cardboard, are, then, placed, inside, the, bottom, of, those, spaces, so, that, the, outer, side, of, the, cardboard, interspersed, with, aluminum, rails, is, seen, as, the, ceiling, from, below, this, makes, it, relatively, easy, to, repair, the, pipes, and, insulation, behind, the, ceiling, since, all, that, is, necessary, is, to, lift, off, the, cardboard, rather, than, digging, through, the, drywall, and, then, replacing, it, other, types, of, ceiling, include, the, cathedral, ceiling, the, concave, or, barrel, shaped, ceiling, the, stretched, ceiling, and, the, coffered, ceiling, coving, often, links, the, ceiling, to, the, surrounding, walls, ceilings, can, play, a, part, in, reducing, fire, hazard, and, a, system, is, available, for, rating, the, fire, resistance, of, dropped, ceilings, ceilings, are, classified, according, to, their, appearance, or, construction, a, cathedral, ceiling, is, any, tall, ceiling, area, similar, to, those, in, a, church, a, dropped, ceiling, is, one, in, which, the, finished, surface, is, constructed, anywhere, from, a, few, inches, or, centimeters, to, several, feet, or, a, few, meters, below, the, structure, above, it, this, may, be, done, for, aesthetic, purposes, such, as, achieving, a, desirable, ceiling, height, or, practical, purposes, such, as, acoustic, damping, or, providing, a, space, for, hvac, or, piping, an, inverse, of, this, would, be, a, raised, floor, a, concave, or, barrel, shaped, ceiling, is, curved, or, rounded, upward, usually, for, visual, or, acoustical, value, while, a, coffered, ceiling, is, divided, into, a, grid, of, recessed, square, or, octagonal, panels, also, called, a, lacunar, ceiling, a, cove, ceiling, uses, a, curved, plaster, transition, between, wall, and, ceiling, it, is, named, for, cove, molding, a, molding, with, a, concave, curve, a, stretched, ceiling, or, stretch, ceiling, uses, a, number, of, individual, panels, using, material, such, as, pvc, fixed, to, a, perimeter, rail, ceilings, have, frequently, been, decorated, with, fresco, painting, mosaic, tiles, and, other, surface, treatments, while, hard, to, execute, at, least, in, place, a, decorated, ceiling, has, the, advantage, that, it, is, largely, protected, from, damage, by, fingers, and, dust, in, the, past, however, this, was, more, than, compensated, for, by, the, damage, from, smoke, from, candles, or, a, fireplace, many, historic, buildings, have, celebrated, ceilings, perhaps, the, most, famous, is, the, sistine, chapel, ceiling, by, michelangelo, ceiling, height, may, have, psychological, impacts, particularly, low, ceilings, the, most, common, ceiling, that, contributes, to, fire, resistance, ratings, in, commercial, and, residential, construction, is, the, dropped, ceiling, in, the, case, of, a, dropped, ceiling, the, rating, is, achieved, by, the, entire, system, which, is, both, the, structure, above, from, which, the, ceilings, is, suspended, which, could, be, a, concrete, floor, or, a, timber, floor, as, well, as, the, suspension, mechanism, and, finally, the, lowest, membrane, or, dropped, ceiling, between, the, structure, that, the, dropped, ceiling, is, suspended, from, and, the, dropped, membrane, such, as, a, t, bar, ceiling, or, a, layer, of, drywall, there, is, often, some, room, for, mechanical, and, electrical, piping, wiring, and, ducting, to, run, an, independent, ceiling, however, can, be, constructed, such, that, it, has, a, stand, alone, fire, resistance, rating, such, systems, must, be, tested, without, the, benefit, of, being, suspended, from, a, slab, above, in, order, to, prove, that, the, resulting, system, is, capable, of, holding, itself, up, this, type, of, ceiling, would, be, installed, to, protect, items, above, from, fire
