a, rifle, is, a, long, barreled, firearm, designed, for, accurate, shooting, and, higher, stopping, power, with, a, barrel, that, has, a, helical, or, spiralling, pattern, of, grooves, rifling, cut, into, the, bore, wall, in, keeping, with, their, focus, on, accuracy, rifles, are, typically, designed, to, be, held, with, both, hands, and, braced, firmly, against, the, shooter, s, shoulder, via, a, buttstock, for, stability, during, shooting, rifles, have, been, used, in, warfare, law, enforcement, hunting, and, target, shooting, sports, the, term, was, originally, rifled, gun, with, the, verb, rifle, referring, to, the, early, modern, machining, process, of, creating, grooves, with, cutting, tools, by, the, 20th, century, the, weapon, had, become, so, common, that, the, modern, noun, rifle, is, now, often, used, for, any, log, shaped, handheld, ranged, weapon, designed, for, well, aimed, discharge, activated, by, a, trigger, like, all, typical, firearms, a, rifle, s, projectile, bullet, is, propelled, by, the, contained, deflagration, of, a, combustible, propellant, compound, originally, black, powder, and, now, nitrocellulose, and, other, smokeless, powders, although, other, propulsive, means, are, used, such, as, compressed, air, in, air, rifles, which, are, popular, for, vermin, control, small, game, hunting, competitive, target, shooting, and, casual, sport, shooting, plinking, the, distinct, feature, that, separates, a, rifle, from, the, earlier, smoothbore, long, guns, e, g, arquebuses, muskets, is, the, rifling, within, its, barrel, the, raised, areas, of, a, barrel, s, rifling, are, called, lands, they, make, contact, with, and, exert, torque, on, the, projectile, as, it, moves, down, the, bore, imparting, a, spin, when, the, projectile, leaves, the, barrel, this, spin, persists, and, lends, gyroscopic, stability, to, the, projectile, due, to, conservation, of, angular, momentum, increasing, accuracy, and, hence, effective, range, historically, rifles, only, fired, a, single, projectile, with, each, squeeze, of, the, trigger, modern, rifles, are, commonly, classified, as, single, shot, bolt, action, semi, automatic, or, automatic, single, shot, bolt, action, and, semi, automatic, rifles, are, limited, by, their, designs, to, fire, a, single, shot, for, each, trigger, pull, only, automatic, rifles, are, capable, of, firing, more, than, one, round, per, trigger, squeeze, however, some, automatic, rifles, are, limited, to, fixed, bursts, of, two, three, or, more, rounds, per, squeeze, modern, automatic, rifles, overlap, to, some, extent, in, design, and, function, with, machine, guns, in, fact, many, light, machine, guns, are, adaptations, of, existing, automatic, rifle, designs, such, as, the, rpk, and, m27, infantry, automatic, rifle, a, military, s, light, machine, guns, are, typically, chambered, for, the, same, caliber, ammunition, as, its, service, rifles, generally, the, difference, between, an, automatic, rifle, and, a, machine, gun, comes, down, to, weight, cooling, system, and, ammunition, feed, system, rifles, with, their, relatively, lighter, components, which, overheat, quickly, and, smaller, capacity, magazines, are, incapable, of, sustained, automatic, fire, in, the, way, that, machine, guns, are, they, trade, this, capability, in, favor, of, increased, mobility, modern, military, rifles, are, fed, by, magazines, while, machine, guns, are, generally, belt, fed, many, machine, guns, allow, the, operator, to, quickly, exchange, barrels, in, order, to, prevent, overheating, whereas, rifles, generally, do, not, most, machine, guns, fire, from, an, open, bolt, in, order, to, reduce, the, danger, of, cook, off, while, almost, all, rifles, fire, from, a, closed, bolt, for, accuracy, machine, guns, are, often, crewed, by, more, than, one, soldier, the, rifle, is, an, individual, weapon, the, term, rifle, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, larger, rifled, crew, served, weapons, firing, explosive, shells, for, example, recoilless, rifles, and, naval, rifles, in, many, works, of, fiction, rifle, refers, to, any, weapon, that, has, a, stock, and, is, shouldered, before, firing, even, if, the, weapon, is, not, rifled, or, does, not, fire, solid, projectiles, e, g, laser, rifle, the, origins, of, rifling, are, difficult, to, trace, but, some, of, the, earliest, european, experiments, seem, to, have, been, carried, out, during, the, 15th, century, archers, had, long, realized, that, a, twist, added, to, the, tail, feathers, of, their, arrows, gave, them, greater, accuracy, early, muskets, produced, large, quantities, of, smoke, and, soot, which, had, to, be, cleaned, from, the, action, and, bore, of, the, musket, frequently, either, through, the, action, of, repeated, bore, scrubbing, or, a, deliberate, attempt, to, create, soot, grooves, that, would, allow, for, more, shots, to, be, fired, from, the, firearm, while, many, people, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, concept, of, rifling, and, rifles, friedrich, engels, claimed, it, as, a, german, invention, in, his, extensive, writings, about, the, history, of, the, rifle, and, the, evolution, and, use, of, the, technology, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, european, grooved, gun, barrels, were, reportedly, manufactured, during, 1440, and, further, developed, by, gaspard, kollner, of, vienna, c, 1498, although, other, scholars, allege, they, were, a, joint, effort, between, kollner, and, augustus, kotter, of, nuremberg, c, 1520, military, commanders, preferred, smoothbore, weapons, for, infantry, use, because, rifles, were, much, more, prone, to, problems, due, to, powder, fouling, the, barrel, and, because, they, took, longer, to, reload, and, fire, than, muskets, rifles, were, created, as, an, improvement, in, the, accuracy, of, smoothbore, muskets, in, the, early, 18th, century, benjamin, robins, an, english, mathematician, realized, that, an, elongated, bullet, would, retain, the, momentum, and, kinetic, energy, of, a, musket, ball, but, would, slice, through, the, air, with, greater, ease, the, black, powder, used, in, early, muzzle, loading, rifles, quickly, fouled, the, barrel, making, loading, slower, and, more, difficult, the, greater, range, of, the, rifle, was, considered, to, be, of, little, practical, use, since, the, smoke, from, black, powder, quickly, obscured, the, battlefield, and, made, it, almost, impossible, to, aim, the, weapon, from, a, distance, since, musketeers, could, not, afford, to, take, the, time, to, stop, and, clean, their, barrels, in, the, middle, of, a, battle, rifles, were, limited, to, use, by, sharpshooters, and, non, military, uses, like, hunting, muskets, were, smoothbore, large, caliber, weapons, using, spherical, ammunition, fired, at, relatively, low, velocity, due, to, the, high, cost, and, great, difficulty, of, precision, manufacturing, and, the, need, to, load, readily, from, the, muzzle, the, musket, ball, was, a, loose, fit, in, the, barrel, consequently, on, firing, the, ball, bounced, off, the, sides, of, the, barrel, when, fired, and, the, final, direction, on, leaving, the, muzzle, was, unpredictable, the, performance, of, early, muskets, defined, the, style, of, warfare, at, the, time, due, to, the, lack, of, accuracy, soldiers, were, deployed, in, long, lines, thus, line, infantry, to, fire, at, the, opposing, forces, precise, aim, was, thus, not, necessary, to, hit, an, opponent, muskets, were, used, for, comparatively, rapid, imprecisely, aimed, volley, fire, and, the, average, soldier, could, be, easily, trained, to, use, them, in, the, province, of, pennsylvania, usa, one, of, the, most, successful, early, rifles, the, long, rifle, was, developed, over, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, compared, to, the, more, common, brown, bess, these, pennsylvania, and, kentucky, rifles, had, a, tighter, bore, with, no, space, between, bullet, and, barrel, and, still, used, balls, instead, of, conical, bullets, the, balls, the, long, rifle, used, were, smaller, allowing, the, production, of, more, rounds, for, a, given, amount, of, lead, these, rifles, also, had, longer, barrels, allowing, more, accuracy, which, were, rifled, with, a, helical, groove, these, first, started, appearing, sometime, before, 1740, one, early, example, being, made, by, jacob, dickert, a, german, immigrant, by, 1750, there, were, a, number, of, such, manufacturers, in, the, area, the, longer, barrel, was, a, departure, by, local, gunsmiths, from, their, german, roots, allowing, bullets, to, achieve, a, higher, speed, as, the, burning, gunpowder, was, contained, longer, before, emerging, from, the, barrel, during, the, 1700s, 18th, century, colonial, settlers, particularly, those, immigrating, from, germany, and, switzerland, adapted, and, improved, upon, their, european, rifles, the, improved, long, rifles, were, used, for, precise, shooting, aiming, and, firing, at, individual, targets, instead, of, the, musket, s, use, for, imprecise, fire, during, the, american, revolution, the, colonist, troops, favoured, these, more, accurate, rifles, while, their, use, was, resisted, by, the, british, and, hessian, troops, by, the, time, of, the, american, revolutionary, war, these, rifles, were, commonly, used, by, frontiersmen, and, congress, authorized, the, establishment, of, ten, companies, of, riflemen, one, of, the, most, critical, units, was, morgan, s, riflemen, led, by, daniel, morgan, this, sharpshooting, unit, eventually, proved, itself, integral, to, the, battle, of, saratoga, and, in, the, southern, states, where, general, morgan, commanded, as, well, taking, advantage, of, the, rifle, s, improved, accuracy, morgan, s, sharpshooters, picked, off, cannoneers, and, officers, reducing, the, impact, of, enemy, artillery, this, kind, of, advantage, was, considered, pivotal, in, many, battles, such, as, the, battles, of, cowpens, saratoga, and, king, s, mountain, later, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, british, 95th, regiment, green, jackets, and, 60th, regiment, royal, american, as, well, as, sharpshooters, and, riflemen, during, the, war, of, 1812, used, the, rifle, to, great, effect, during, skirmishing, because, of, a, slower, loading, time, than, a, musket, they, were, not, adopted, by, the, whole, army, since, rifles, were, used, by, sharpshooters, who, did, not, routinely, fire, over, other, men, s, shoulders, long, length, was, not, required, to, avoid, the, forward, line, a, shorter, length, made, a, handier, weapon, in, which, tight, fitting, balls, did, not, have, to, be, rammed, so, far, down, the, barrel, the, invention, of, the, mini, ball, in, the, 1840s, solved, the, slow, loading, problem, and, in, the, 1850s, and, 1860s, rifles, quickly, replaced, muskets, on, the, battlefield, many, rifles, often, referred, to, as, rifled, muskets, were, very, similar, to, the, muskets, they, replaced, but, the, military, also, experimented, with, other, designs, breech, loading, weapons, proved, to, have, a, much, faster, rate, of, fire, than, muzzleloaders, causing, military, forces, to, abandon, muzzle, loaders, in, favor, of, breech, loading, designs, in, the, late, 1860s, in, the, later, part, of, the, 19th, century, rifles, were, generally, single, shot, breech, loading, guns, designed, for, aimed, discretionary, fire, by, individual, soldiers, then, as, now, rifles, had, a, stock, either, fixed, or, folding, to, be, braced, against, the, shoulder, when, firing, the, adoption, of, cartridges, and, breech, loading, in, the, 19th, century, was, concurrent, with, the, general, adoption, of, rifles, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, soldiers, were, trained, to, shoot, accurately, over, long, ranges, with, high, powered, cartridges, world, war, i, lee, enfield, rifles, among, others, were, equipped, with, long, range, volley, sights, for, massed, firing, at, ranges, of, up, to, 1, 6, km, 1, mi, individual, shots, were, unlikely, to, hit, but, a, platoon, firing, repeatedly, could, produce, a, beaten, ground, effect, similar, to, light, artillery, or, machine, guns, currently, rifles, are, the, most, common, firearm, in, general, use, for, hunting, with, the, exception, of, bird, hunting, where, shotguns, are, favored, rifles, derived, from, military, designs, have, long, been, popular, with, civilian, shooters, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, british, army, created, several, experimental, units, known, as, rifles, armed, with, the, baker, rifle, these, rifle, regiments, were, deployed, as, skirmishers, during, the, peninsular, war, in, spain, and, portugal, and, were, more, effective, than, skirmishers, armed, with, muskets, due, to, their, accuracy, and, long, range, gradually, rifles, appeared, with, cylindrical, barrels, cut, with, helical, grooves, the, surfaces, between, the, grooves, being, lands, the, innovation, was, shortly, followed, by, the, mass, adoption, of, breech, loading, weapons, as, it, was, not, practical, to, push, an, overbore, bullet, down, through, a, rifled, barrel, the, dirt, and, grime, from, prior, shots, were, pushed, down, ahead, of, a, tight, bullet, or, ball, which, may, have, been, a, looser, fit, in, the, clean, barrel, before, the, first, shot, and, loading, was, far, more, difficult, as, the, lead, had, to, be, deformed, to, go, down, in, the, first, place, reducing, the, accuracy, due, to, deformation, several, systems, were, tried, to, deal, with, the, problem, usually, by, resorting, to, an, under, bore, bullet, that, expanded, upon, firing, the, original, muzzle, loading, rifle, with, a, closely, fitting, ball, to, take, the, rifling, grooves, was, loaded, with, difficulty, particularly, when, foul, and, for, this, reason, was, not, generally, used, for, military, purposes, with, the, advent, of, rifling, the, bullet, itself, did, not, initially, change, but, was, wrapped, in, a, greased, cloth, patch, to, grip, the, rifling, grooves, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, saw, a, distinct, change, in, the, shape, and, function, of, the, bullet, in, 1826, delvigne, a, french, infantry, officer, invented, a, breech, with, abrupt, shoulders, on, which, a, spherical, bullet, was, rammed, down, until, it, caught, the, rifling, grooves, delvigne, s, method, however, deformed, the, bullet, and, was, inaccurate, soon, after, the, carabine, tige, was, invented, by, louis, etienne, de, thouvenin, which, had, a, stem, at, the, bottom, of, the, barrel, that, would, deform, and, expand, the, base, of, the, bullet, when, rammed, therefore, enabling, accurate, contact, with, the, rifling, however, the, area, around, the, stem, clogged, and, got, dirty, easily, one, of, the, most, famous, was, the, mini, system, invented, by, french, army, captain, claude, tienne, mini, which, relied, on, a, conical, bullet, known, as, a, mini, ball, with, a, hollow, skirt, at, the, base, of, the, bullet, when, fired, the, skirt, would, expand, from, the, pressure, of, the, exploding, charge, and, grip, the, rifling, as, the, round, was, fired, the, better, seal, gave, more, power, as, less, gas, escaped, past, the, bullet, also, for, the, same, bore, caliber, diameter, a, long, bullet, was, heavier, than, a, round, ball, the, extra, grip, also, spun, the, bullet, more, consistently, which, increased, the, range, from, about, 50, yards, for, a, smoothbore, musket, to, about, 300, yards, for, a, rifle, using, the, mini, system, the, expanding, skirt, of, the, mini, ball, also, solved, the, problem, that, earlier, tight, fitting, bullets, were, difficult, to, load, as, black, powder, residue, fouled, the, inside, of, the, barrel, the, mini, system, allowed, conical, bullets, to, be, loaded, into, rifles, just, as, quickly, as, round, balls, in, smooth, bores, which, allowed, rifle, muskets, to, replace, muskets, on, the, battlefield, mini, system, rifles, notably, the, u, s, springfield, and, the, british, enfield, of, the, early, 1860s, featured, prominently, in, the, u, s, civil, war, due, to, their, enhanced, power, and, accuracy, at, the, time, of, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, the, mini, rifle, was, considered, the, best, in, military, use, over, the, 19th, century, bullet, design, also, evolved, the, bullets, becoming, gradually, smaller, and, lighter, by, 1910, the, standard, blunt, nosed, bullet, had, been, replaced, by, the, pointed, spitzer, bullet, an, innovation, that, increased, range, and, penetration, cartridge, design, evolved, from, simple, paper, tubes, containing, black, powder, and, shot, to, sealed, brass, cases, with, integral, primers, for, ignition, and, black, powder, was, replaced, by, cordite, and, then, other, nitro, cellulose, based, smokeless, powder, mixtures, propelling, bullets, to, higher, velocities, than, before, the, increased, velocity, meant, that, new, problems, arrived, and, so, bullets, went, from, being, soft, lead, to, harder, lead, then, to, copper, jacketed, in, order, to, better, engage, the, spiral, grooves, without, stripping, them, in, the, same, way, that, a, screw, or, bolt, thread, would, be, stripped, if, subjected, to, extreme, forces, from, 1836, breech, loading, rifles, were, introduced, with, the, german, dreyse, needle, gun, followed, by, the, french, tabati, re, in, 1857, and, the, british, calisher, and, terry, carbine, made, in, birmingham, and, later, in, 1864, and, the, better, known, british, snider, enfield, primitive, chamber, locking, mechanisms, were, soon, replaced, by, bolt, action, mechanisms, exemplified, by, the, french, chassepot, in, 1866, breech, loading, was, to, have, a, major, impact, on, warfare, as, breech, loading, rifles, can, be, fired, at, a, rate, many, times, faster, than, muzzle, loaded, rifles, and, significantly, can, be, loaded, from, a, prone, rather, than, standing, position, firing, prone, i, e, lying, down, is, more, accurate, than, firing, from, a, standing, position, and, a, prone, rifleman, presents, a, much, smaller, target, than, a, standing, soldier, the, higher, accuracy, and, range, combined, with, reduced, vulnerability, generally, benefited, the, defense, while, making, the, traditional, battle, between, lines, of, standing, and, volleying, infantrymen, obsolete, revolving, rifles, were, an, attempt, to, increase, the, rate, of, fire, of, rifles, by, combining, them, with, the, revolving, firing, mechanism, that, had, been, developed, earlier, for, revolving, pistols, colt, began, experimenting, with, revolving, rifles, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, other, manufacturers, like, remington, later, experimented, with, them, as, well, the, colt, revolving, rifle, model, 1855, was, an, early, repeating, rifle, and, the, first, one, to, be, used, by, the, u, s, government, and, saw, some, limited, action, during, the, american, civil, war, revolvers, both, rifles, and, pistols, tend, to, spray, fragments, of, metal, from, the, front, of, the, cylinder, the, winchester, repeating, rifle, was, invented, in, 1866, the, firer, pulled, on, a, lever, to, reload, the, rifle, with, a, stored, cartridge, an, important, area, of, development, was, the, way, that, cartridges, were, stored, and, used, in, the, weapon, the, spencer, repeating, rifle, was, a, breech, loading, manually, operated, lever, action, rifle, that, was, adopted, by, the, united, states, over, 20, 000, were, used, during, the, american, civil, war, it, was, the, first, adoption, of, a, removable, magazine, fed, infantry, rifle, the, design, was, completed, by, christopher, spencer, in, 1860, it, used, copper, rimfire, cartridges, stored, in, a, removable, seven, round, tube, magazine, enabling, the, rounds, to, be, fired, one, after, another, when, the, magazine, was, empty, it, could, be, exchanged, for, another, in, the, russo, japanese, war, of, 1904, 1905, military, observers, from, europe, and, the, united, states, witnessed, a, major, conflict, fought, with, high, velocity, bolt, action, rifles, firing, smokeless, powder, 179, 229, 230, 104, 105, the, battle, of, mukden, fought, in, 1905, consisted, of, nearly, 343, 000, russian, troops, against, over, 281, 000, japanese, troops, the, russian, mosin, nagant, model, 1891, in, 7, 62, mm, was, pitted, against, the, japanese, arisaka, type, 30, bolt, action, rifle, in, 6, 5, mm, 104, 105, 155, both, had, velocities, well, over, 2, 000, feet, per, second, 610, m, s, 187, 28, 29, until, the, late, 19th, century, rifles, tended, to, be, very, long, some, long, rifles, reaching, approximately, 2, m, 7, ft, in, length, to, maximize, accuracy, making, early, rifles, impractical, for, use, by, cavalry, however, following, the, advent, of, more, powerful, smokeless, powder, a, shorter, barrel, did, not, impair, accuracy, as, much, as, a, result, cavalry, saw, limited, but, noteworthy, usage, in, 20th, century, conflicts, the, advent, of, the, massed, rapid, firepower, of, the, machine, gun, submachine, gun, and, rifled, artillery, was, so, quick, as, to, outstrip, the, development, of, any, way, to, attack, a, trench, defended, by, riflemen, and, machine, gunners, the, carnage, of, world, war, i, was, perhaps, the, greatest, vindication, and, vilification, of, the, rifle, as, a, military, weapon, the, m1, garand, was, a, semi, automatic, rapid, fire, rifle, developed, for, modern, warfare, use, in, world, war, ii, during, and, after, world, war, ii, it, became, accepted, that, most, infantry, engagements, occurred, at, ranges, of, less, than, 300, m, the, range, and, power, of, the, large, full, powered, rifle, cartridges, were, overkill, requiring, weapons, heavier, than, otherwise, necessary, this, led, to, germany, s, development, of, the, 7, 92, 33mm, kurz, short, round, the, mkb, 42, and, ultimately, the, assault, rifle, today, an, infantryman, s, rifle, is, optimized, for, ranges, of, 300, m, or, less, and, soldiers, are, trained, to, deliver, individual, rounds, or, bursts, of, fire, within, these, distances, typically, the, application, of, accurate, long, range, fire, is, the, domain, of, the, marksman, and, the, sniper, in, warfare, and, of, enthusiastic, target, shooters, in, peacetime, the, modern, marksman, rifle, and, sniper, rifle, are, usually, capable, of, accuracy, better, than, 0, 3, mrad, at, 100, yards, 1, arcminute, the, grizzly, is, a, 3d, printed, 22, caliber, rifle, created, around, august, 2013, it, was, created, using, a, stratasys, dimension, 1200es, printer, it, was, created, by, a, canadian, only, known, by, the, pseudonym, matthew, who, told, the, verge, that, he, was, in, his, late, 20s, and, his, main, job, was, making, tools, for, the, construction, industry, the, original, grizzly, fired, a, single, shot, before, breaking, grizzly, 2, 0, fired, fourteen, bullets, before, getting, damaged, due, to, the, strain, in, october, 2020, another, 3d, printed, 9mm, rifle, known, as, the, fgc, 9mm, was, created, it, is, reported, that, it, can, be, made, in, 2, weeks, with, 500, of, tools, a, second, model, was, later, made, in, april, 2021, a, youth, rifle, is, a, rifle, designed, or, modified, for, fitting, children, or, other, small, framed, shooters, a, youth, rifle, is, often, a, single, shot, 22, caliber, rifle, or, a, bolt, action, rifle, although, some, youth, rifles, are, semi, automatic, they, are, usually, very, light, with, a, greatly, shortened, length, of, pull, which, is, necessary, to, accommodate, children, youth, stocks, are, available, for, many, popular, rifles, such, as, the, ruger, 10, 22, a, semi, automatic, 22, lr, rifle, allowing, a, youth, rifle, to, be, made, from, a, standard, rifle, by, simply, changing, the, stock, the, typical, ages, of, shooters, for, such, rifles, vary, from, about, age, 5, the, usual, form, of, rifling, was, helical, grooves, in, a, round, bore, some, early, rifled, firearms, had, barrels, with, a, twisted, polygonal, bore, the, whitworth, rifle, was, the, first, such, type, designed, to, spin, the, round, for, accuracy, bullets, for, these, guns, were, made, to, match, the, shape, of, the, bore, so, the, bullet, would, grip, the, rifle, bore, and, take, a, spin, that, way, these, were, generally, large, caliber, weapons, and, the, ammunition, still, did, not, fit, tightly, in, the, barrel, many, different, shapes, and, degrees, of, spiraling, were, used, in, experimental, designs, one, widely, produced, example, was, the, metford, rifling, in, the, pattern, 1888, lee, metford, service, rifle, although, uncommon, polygonal, rifling, is, still, used, in, some, weapons, today, one, example, being, the, glock, line, of, pistols, which, fire, standard, bullets, many, of, the, early, designs, were, prone, to, dangerous, backfiring, which, could, lead, to, the, destruction, of, the, weapon, and, serious, injury, to, the, person, firing, it, as, the, bullet, enters, the, barrel, it, inserts, itself, into, the, rifling, a, process, that, gradually, wears, down, the, barrel, and, also, causes, the, barrel, to, heat, up, more, rapidly, therefore, some, machine, guns, are, equipped, with, quick, change, barrels, that, can, be, swapped, every, few, thousand, rounds, or, in, earlier, designs, were, water, cooled, unlike, older, carbon, steel, barrels, which, were, limited, to, around, 1, 000, shots, before, the, extreme, heat, caused, accuracy, to, fade, modern, stainless, steel, barrels, for, target, rifles, are, much, more, resistant, to, wear, allowing, many, thousands, of, rounds, to, be, fired, before, accuracy, drops, many, shotguns, and, small, arms, have, chrome, lined, barrels, to, reduce, wear, and, enhance, corrosion, resistance, this, is, rare, on, rifles, designed, for, extreme, accuracy, as, the, plating, process, is, difficult, and, liable, to, reduce, the, effect, of, the, rifling, modern, ammunition, has, a, hardened, lead, core, with, a, softer, outer, cladding, or, jacket, typically, of, an, alloy, of, copper, and, nickel, cupro, nickel, some, ammunition, is, coated, with, molybdenum, disulfide, to, further, reduce, internal, friction, the, so, called, moly, coated, bullet, rifles, were, initially, single, shot, muzzle, loading, weapons, during, the, 18th, century, breech, loading, weapons, were, designed, which, allowed, the, rifleman, to, reload, while, under, cover, but, defects, in, manufacturing, and, the, difficulty, in, forming, a, reliable, gas, tight, seal, prevented, widespread, adoption, during, the, 19th, century, multi, shot, repeating, rifles, using, lever, pump, or, linear, bolt, actions, became, standard, further, increasing, the, rate, of, fire, and, minimizing, the, fuss, involved, in, loading, a, firearm, the, problem, of, proper, seal, creation, had, been, solved, with, the, use, of, brass, cartridge, cases, which, expanded, in, an, elastic, fashion, at, the, point, of, firing, and, effectively, sealed, the, breech, while, the, pressure, remained, high, then, relaxed, back, enough, to, allow, for, easy, removal, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, leading, bolt, action, design, was, that, of, paul, mauser, whose, action, wedded, to, a, reliable, design, possessing, a, five, shot, magazine, became, a, world, standard, through, two, world, wars, and, beyond, the, mauser, rifle, was, paralleled, by, britain, s, ten, shot, lee, enfield, and, america, s, 1903, springfield, rifle, models, the, american, m1903, closely, copied, mauser, s, original, design, barrel, rifling, dramatically, increased, the, range, and, accuracy, of, the, musket, indeed, throughout, its, development, the, rifle, s, history, has, been, marked, by, increases, in, range, and, accuracy, from, the, mini, rifle, and, beyond, the, rifle, has, become, ever, more, potent, at, long, range, strikes, in, recent, decades, large, caliber, anti, materiel, rifles, typically, firing, between, 12, 7, mm, and, 20, mm, caliber, cartridges, have, been, developed, the, us, barrett, m82a1, is, probably, the, best, known, such, rifle, a, second, example, is, the, ax50, by, accuracy, international, these, weapons, are, typically, used, to, strike, critical, vulnerable, targets, such, as, computerized, command, and, control, vehicles, radio, trucks, radar, antennae, vehicle, engine, blocks, and, the, jet, engines, of, enemy, aircraft, anti, materiel, rifles, can, be, used, against, human, targets, but, the, much, higher, weight, of, rifle, and, ammunition, and, the, massive, recoil, and, muzzle, blast, usually, make, them, less, than, practical, for, such, use, the, barrett, m82, is, designed, with, a, maximum, effective, range, of, 1, 800, m, 1, 1, mi, although, it, has, a, confirmed, kill, distance, of, 2, 430, m, 1, 51, mi, in, afghanistan, during, operation, anaconda, in, 2002, the, record, for, the, longest, confirmed, kill, shot, stands, at, 3, 540, m, 11, 610, ft, set, by, an, unnamed, soldier, with, canada, s, elite, special, operations, unit, joint, task, force, 2, using, a, mcmillan, tac, 50, sniper, rifle, bullets, leaving, a, rifled, barrel, can, spin, at, a, rotational, speed, of, over, 100, 000, revolutions, per, minute, rpm, or, over, about, 1, 67, kilohertz, since, 1, rpm, 1, 60, hz, the, rotational, speed, depends, both, on, the, muzzle, velocity, of, the, bullet, and, the, pitch, of, the, rifling, excessive, rotational, speed, can, exceed, the, bullet, s, designed, limits, and, the, inadequate, centripetal, force, will, fail, to, keep, the, bullet, from, disintegrating, in, a, radial, fashion, the, rotational, speed, of, the, bullet, can, be, calculated, by, using, the, formula, below, using, metric, units, the, formula, divides, the, number, of, millimeters, in, a, meter, 1000, by, the, barrel, twist, in, millimeters, the, length, of, travel, along, the, barrel, per, full, rotation, this, number, is, then, multiplied, by, the, muzzle, velocity, in, meters, per, second, m, s, and, the, number, of, seconds, in, a, minute, 60, for, example, using, a, barrel, that, has, a, twist, rate, of, 190, mm, with, a, muzzle, velocity, of, 900, m, s, using, imperial, units, the, formula, divides, the, number, of, inches, in, a, foot, 12, by, the, rate, of, twist, that, the, barrel, has, this, number, is, multiplied, by, the, muzzle, velocity, mv, and, the, number, of, seconds, in, a, minute, 60, for, example, a, bullet, with, a, muzzle, velocity, of, 3, 000, feet, per, second, 910, m, s, leaving, a, barrel, that, twists, once, per, foot, 1, 12, would, rotate, at, 180, 000rpm, for, example, using, a, barrel, that, has, a, twist, rate, of, 1, turn, in, 8, with, a, muzzle, velocity, of, 3000, ft, s, rifles, may, be, chambered, in, a, variety, of, calibers, bullet, or, barrel, diameters, from, as, low, as, 4, 4, mm, 17, inch, varmint, calibers, to, as, high, as, 20, mm, 80, caliber, in, the, case, of, the, largest, anti, tank, rifles, the, term, caliber, essentially, refers, to, the, width, of, the, bullet, fired, through, a, rifle, s, barrel, armies, have, consistently, attempted, to, find, and, procure, the, most, lethal, and, accurate, caliber, for, their, firearms, the, standard, calibers, used, by, the, world, s, militaries, tend, to, follow, worldwide, trends, these, trends, have, significantly, changed, during, the, centuries, of, firearm, design, and, re, design, muskets, were, normally, chambered, for, large, calibers, such, as, 50, or, 59, 12, 7, mm, or, 15, mm, with, the, theory, that, these, large, bullets, caused, the, most, damage, during, world, war, i, and, ii, most, rifles, were, chambered, in, 30, caliber, 7, 62, mm, a, combination, of, power, and, speed, examples, would, be, the, 303, british, lee, enfield, the, american, m1903, 30, 06, and, the, german, 8mm, mauser, k98, an, exception, was, the, italian, modello, 91, rifle, which, used, the, 6, 5, 52mm, mannlicher, carcano, cartridge, detailed, study, of, infantry, combat, during, and, after, world, war, ii, revealed, that, most, small, arms, engagements, occurred, within, 100, meters, meaning, that, the, power, and, range, of, the, traditional, 30, caliber, weapons, designed, for, engagements, at, 500, meters, and, beyond, were, essentially, wasted, the, single, greatest, predictor, of, an, individual, soldier, s, combat, effectiveness, was, the, number, of, rounds, he, fired, weapons, designers, and, strategists, realized, that, service, rifles, firing, smaller, caliber, projectiles, would, allow, troops, to, carry, far, more, ammunition, for, the, same, weight, the, lower, recoil, and, more, generous, magazine, capacities, of, small, caliber, weapons, also, allow, troops, a, much, greater, volume, of, fire, compared, to, historical, battle, rifles, smaller, faster, traveling, less, stable, projectiles, have, also, demonstrated, greater, terminal, ballistics, and, therein, a, greater, lethality, than, traditional, 30, caliber, rounds, most, modern, service, rifles, fire, a, projectile, of, approximately, 5, 56, mm, examples, of, firearms, in, this, range, are, the, american, 5, 56, mm, m16, and, the, russian, 5, 45, 39mm, ak, 74
