pottery, is, the, process, and, the, products, of, forming, vessels, and, other, objects, with, clay, and, other, raw, materials, which, are, fired, at, high, temperatures, to, give, them, a, hard, and, durable, form, the, place, where, such, wares, are, made, by, a, potter, is, also, called, a, pottery, plural, potteries, the, definition, of, pottery, used, by, the, astm, international, is, all, fired, ceramic, wares, that, contain, clay, when, formed, except, technical, structural, and, refractory, products, end, applications, include, tableware, decorative, ware, sanitary, ware, and, in, technology, and, industry, such, as, electrical, insulators, and, laboratory, ware, in, art, history, and, archaeology, especially, of, ancient, and, prehistoric, periods, pottery, often, means, only, vessels, and, sculpted, figurines, of, the, same, material, are, called, terracottas, pottery, is, one, of, the, oldest, human, inventions, originating, before, the, neolithic, period, with, ceramic, objects, such, as, the, gravettian, culture, venus, of, doln, v, stonice, figurine, discovered, in, the, czech, republic, dating, back, to, 29, 000, 25, 000, bc, however, the, earliest, known, pottery, vessels, were, discovered, in, jiangxi, china, which, date, back, to, 18, 000, bc, other, early, neolithic, and, pre, neolithic, pottery, artifacts, have, been, found, in, j, mon, japan, 10, 500, bc, the, russian, far, east, 14, 000, bc, sub, saharan, africa, 9, 400, bc, south, america, 9, 000s, 7, 000s, bc, and, the, middle, east, 7, 000s, 6, 000s, bc, pottery, is, made, by, forming, a, clay, body, into, objects, of, a, desired, shape, and, heating, them, to, high, temperatures, 600, 1600, c, in, a, bonfire, pit, or, kiln, which, induces, reactions, that, lead, to, permanent, changes, including, increasing, the, strength, and, rigidity, of, the, object, much, pottery, is, purely, utilitarian, but, some, can, also, be, regarded, as, ceramic, art, an, article, can, be, decorated, before, or, after, firing, pottery, is, traditionally, divided, into, three, types, earthenware, stoneware, and, porcelain, all, three, may, be, glazed, and, unglazed, all, may, also, be, decorated, by, various, techniques, in, many, examples, the, group, a, piece, belongs, to, is, immediately, visually, apparent, but, this, is, not, always, the, case, for, example, fritware, uses, no, or, little, clay, so, falls, outside, these, groups, historic, pottery, of, all, these, types, is, often, grouped, as, either, fine, wares, relatively, expensive, and, well, made, and, following, the, aesthetic, taste, of, the, culture, concerned, or, alternatively, coarse, popular, folk, or, village, wares, mostly, undecorated, or, simply, so, and, often, less, well, made, cooking, in, pottery, became, less, popular, once, metal, pots, became, available, but, is, still, used, for, dishes, that, benefit, from, the, qualities, of, pottery, cooking, typically, slow, cooking, in, an, oven, such, as, biryani, cassoulet, daube, tagine, jollof, rice, kedjenou, cazuela, and, types, of, baked, beans, the, earliest, forms, of, pottery, were, made, from, clays, that, were, fired, at, low, temperatures, initially, in, pit, fires, or, in, open, bonfires, they, were, hand, formed, and, undecorated, earthenware, can, be, fired, as, low, as, 600, c, and, is, normally, fired, below, 1200, c, because, unglazed, earthenware, is, porous, it, has, limited, utility, for, the, storage, of, liquids, or, as, tableware, however, earthenware, has, had, a, continuous, history, from, the, neolithic, period, to, today, it, can, be, made, from, a, wide, variety, of, clays, some, of, which, fire, to, a, buff, brown, or, black, colour, with, iron, in, the, constituent, minerals, resulting, in, a, reddish, brown, reddish, coloured, varieties, are, called, terracotta, especially, when, unglazed, or, used, for, sculpture, the, development, of, ceramic, glaze, made, impermeable, pottery, possible, improving, the, popularity, and, practicality, of, pottery, vessels, decoration, has, evolved, and, developed, through, history, stoneware, is, pottery, that, has, been, fired, in, a, kiln, at, a, relatively, high, temperature, from, about, 1, 100, c, to, 1, 200, c, and, is, stronger, and, non, porous, to, liquids, the, chinese, who, developed, stoneware, very, early, on, classify, this, together, with, porcelain, as, high, fired, wares, in, contrast, stoneware, could, only, be, produced, in, europe, from, the, late, middle, ages, as, european, kilns, were, less, efficient, and, the, right, type, of, clay, less, common, it, remained, a, speciality, of, germany, until, the, renaissance, stoneware, is, very, tough, and, practical, and, much, of, it, has, always, been, utilitarian, for, the, kitchen, or, storage, rather, than, the, table, but, fine, stoneware, has, been, important, in, china, japan, and, the, west, and, continues, to, be, made, many, utilitarian, types, have, also, come, to, be, appreciated, as, art, porcelain, is, made, by, heating, materials, generally, including, kaolin, in, a, kiln, to, temperatures, between, 1, 200, and, 1, 400, c, 2, 200, and, 2, 600, f, this, is, higher, than, used, for, the, other, types, and, achieving, these, temperatures, was, a, long, struggle, as, well, as, realizing, what, materials, were, needed, the, toughness, strength, and, translucence, of, porcelain, relative, to, other, types, of, pottery, arises, mainly, from, vitrification, and, the, formation, of, the, mineral, mullite, within, the, body, at, these, high, temperatures, although, porcelain, was, first, made, in, china, the, chinese, traditionally, do, not, recognise, it, as, a, distinct, category, grouping, it, with, stoneware, as, high, fired, ware, opposed, to, low, fired, earthenware, this, confuses, the, issue, of, when, it, was, first, made, a, degree, of, translucency, and, whiteness, was, achieved, by, the, tang, dynasty, ad, 618, 906, and, considerable, quantities, were, being, exported, the, modern, level, of, whiteness, was, not, reached, until, much, later, in, the, 14th, century, porcelain, was, also, made, in, korea, and, in, japan, from, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, after, suitable, kaolin, was, located, in, those, countries, it, was, not, made, effectively, outside, east, asia, until, the, 18th, century, the, study, of, pottery, can, help, to, provide, an, insight, into, past, cultures, fabric, analysis, see, section, below, used, to, analyse, the, fabric, of, pottery, is, important, part, of, archaeology, for, understanding, the, archaeological, culture, of, the, excavated, site, by, studying, the, fabric, of, artifacts, such, as, their, usage, source, material, composition, decorative, pattern, color, of, patterns, etc, this, helps, to, understand, characteristics, sophistication, habits, technology, tools, trade, etc, of, the, people, who, made, and, used, the, pottery, carbon, dating, reveals, the, age, sites, with, similar, pottery, characteristics, have, the, same, culture, those, sites, which, have, distinct, cultural, characteristics, but, with, some, overlap, are, indicative, of, cultural, exchange, such, as, trade, or, living, in, vicinity, or, continuity, of, habitation, etc, examples, are, black, and, red, ware, redware, sothi, siswal, culture, and, painted, grey, ware, culture, the, six, fabrics, of, kalibangan, is, a, good, example, of, use, of, fabric, analysis, in, identifying, a, differentiated, culture, which, was, earlier, thought, to, be, typical, indus, valley, civilisation, ivc, culture, pottery, is, durable, and, fragments, at, least, often, survive, long, after, artifacts, made, from, less, durable, materials, have, decayed, past, recognition, combined, with, other, evidence, the, study, of, pottery, artefacts, is, helpful, in, the, development, of, theories, on, the, organisation, economic, condition, and, the, cultural, development, of, the, societies, that, produced, or, acquired, pottery, the, study, of, pottery, may, also, allow, inferences, to, be, drawn, about, a, culture, s, daily, life, religion, social, relationships, attitudes, towards, neighbours, attitudes, to, their, own, world, and, even, the, way, the, culture, understood, the, universe, it, is, valuable, to, look, into, pottery, as, an, archaeological, record, of, potential, interaction, between, peoples, when, pottery, is, placed, within, the, context, of, linguistic, and, migratory, patterns, it, becomes, an, even, more, prevalent, category, of, social, artifact, as, proposed, by, olivier, p, gosselain, it, is, possible, to, understand, ranges, of, cross, cultural, interaction, by, looking, closely, at, the, cha, ne, op, ratoire, of, ceramic, production, the, methods, used, to, produce, pottery, in, early, sub, saharan, africa, are, divisible, into, three, categories, techniques, visible, to, the, eye, decoration, firing, and, post, firing, techniques, techniques, related, to, the, materials, selection, or, processing, of, clay, etc, and, techniques, of, molding, or, fashioning, the, clay, these, three, categories, can, be, used, to, consider, the, implications, of, the, reoccurrence, of, a, particular, sort, of, pottery, in, different, areas, generally, the, techniques, that, are, easily, visible, the, first, category, of, those, mentioned, above, are, thus, readily, imitated, and, may, indicate, a, more, distant, connection, between, groups, such, as, trade, in, the, same, market, or, even, relatively, close, settlements, techniques, that, require, more, studied, replication, i, e, the, selection, of, clay, and, the, fashioning, of, clay, may, indicate, a, closer, connection, between, peoples, as, these, methods, are, usually, only, transmissible, between, potters, and, those, otherwise, directly, involved, in, production, such, a, relationship, requires, the, ability, of, the, involved, parties, to, communicate, effectively, implying, pre, existing, norms, of, contact, or, a, shared, language, between, the, two, thus, the, patterns, of, technical, diffusion, in, pot, making, that, are, visible, via, archaeological, findings, also, reveal, patterns, in, societal, interaction, chronologies, based, on, pottery, are, often, essential, for, dating, non, literate, cultures, and, are, often, of, help, in, the, dating, of, historic, cultures, as, well, trace, element, analysis, mostly, by, neutron, activation, allows, the, sources, of, clay, to, be, accurately, identified, and, the, thermoluminescence, test, can, be, used, to, provide, an, estimate, of, the, date, of, last, firing, examining, sherds, from, prehistory, scientists, learned, that, during, high, temperature, firing, iron, materials, in, clay, record, the, state, of, the, earth, s, magnetic, field, at, that, moment, the, clay, body, is, also, called, the, paste, or, the, fabric, which, consists, of, 2, things, the, clay, matrix, composed, of, grains, of, less, than, 0, 02, mm, grains, which, can, be, seen, using, the, high, powered, microscopes, or, a, scanning, electron, microscope, and, the, clay, inclusions, which, are, larger, grains, of, clay, and, could, be, seen, with, the, naked, eye, or, a, low, power, binocular, microscope, for, geologists, fabric, analysis, means, spatial, arrangement, of, minerals, in, a, rock, for, archaeologists, the, fabric, analysis, of, pottery, entails, the, study, of, clay, matrix, and, inclusions, in, the, clay, body, as, well, as, the, firing, temperature, and, conditions, analysis, is, done, to, examine, the, following, 3, in, detail, the, six, fabrics, of, kalibangan, is, a, good, example, of, fabric, analysis, body, or, clay, body, is, the, material, used, to, form, pottery, thus, a, potter, might, prepare, or, order, from, a, supplier, such, an, amount, of, earthenware, body, stoneware, body, or, porcelain, body, the, compositions, of, clay, bodies, varies, considerably, and, include, both, prepared, and, as, dug, the, former, being, by, far, the, dominant, type, for, studio, and, industry, the, properties, also, vary, considerably, and, include, plasticity, and, mechanical, strength, before, firing, the, firing, temperature, needed, to, mature, them, properties, after, firing, such, as, permeability, mechanical, strength, and, colour, there, can, be, regional, variations, in, the, properties, of, raw, materials, used, for, pottery, and, these, can, lead, to, wares, that, are, unique, in, character, to, a, locality, the, main, ingredient, of, the, body, is, clay, some, different, types, used, for, pottery, include, it, is, common, for, clays, and, other, raw, materials, to, be, mixed, to, produce, clay, bodies, suited, to, specific, purposes, various, mineral, processing, techniques, are, often, utilised, before, mixing, the, raw, materials, with, comminution, being, effectively, universal, for, non, clay, materials, examples, of, non, clay, materials, include, the, production, of, pottery, includes, the, following, stages, before, being, shaped, clay, must, be, prepared, this, may, include, kneading, to, ensure, an, even, moisture, content, throughout, the, body, air, trapped, within, the, clay, body, needs, to, be, removed, or, de, aired, and, can, be, accomplished, either, by, a, machine, called, a, vacuum, pug, or, manually, by, wedging, wedging, can, also, help, produce, an, even, moisture, content, once, a, clay, body, has, been, kneaded, and, de, aired, or, wedged, it, is, shaped, by, a, variety, of, techniques, which, include, prior, to, firing, the, water, in, an, article, needs, to, be, removed, a, number, of, different, stages, or, conditions, of, the, article, can, be, identified, firing, produces, permanent, and, irreversible, chemical, and, physical, changes, in, the, body, it, is, only, after, firing, that, the, article, or, material, is, pottery, in, lower, fired, pottery, the, changes, include, sintering, the, fusing, together, of, coarser, particles, in, the, body, at, their, points, of, contact, with, each, other, in, the, case, of, porcelain, where, higher, firing, temperatures, are, used, the, physical, chemical, and, mineralogical, properties, of, the, constituents, in, the, body, are, greatly, altered, in, all, cases, the, reason, for, firing, is, to, permanently, harden, the, wares, and, the, firing, regime, must, be, appropriate, to, the, materials, used, as, a, rough, guide, modern, earthenwares, are, normally, fired, at, temperatures, in, the, range, of, about, 1, 000, c, 1, 830, f, to, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, stonewares, at, between, about, 1, 100, c, 2, 010, f, to, 1, 300, c, 2, 370, f, and, porcelains, at, between, about, 1, 200, c, 2, 190, f, to, 1, 400, c, 2, 550, f, historically, reaching, high, temperatures, was, a, long, lasting, challenge, and, earthenware, can, be, fired, effectively, as, low, as, 600, c, 1, 112, f, achievable, in, primitive, pit, firing, the, time, spent, at, any, particular, temperature, is, also, important, the, combination, of, heat, and, time, is, known, as, heatwork, kilns, can, be, monitored, by, pyrometers, thermocouples, and, pyrometric, devices, the, atmosphere, within, a, kiln, during, firing, can, affect, the, appearance, of, the, body, and, glaze, key, to, this, is, the, differing, colours, of, the, various, oxides, of, iron, such, as, iron, iii, oxide, also, known, as, ferric, oxide, or, fe, 2, o, 3, which, is, associated, with, brown, red, colours, whilst, iron, ii, oxide, also, known, as, ferrous, oxide, or, feo, is, associated, with, much, darker, colours, including, black, the, oxygen, concentration, in, the, kiln, influences, the, type, and, relative, proportions, of, these, iron, oxides, in, fired, the, body, and, glaze, for, example, where, there, is, a, lack, of, oxygen, during, firing, the, associated, carbon, monoxide, co, will, readily, react, with, oxygen, in, fe, 2, o, 3, in, the, raw, materials, and, cause, it, to, be, reduced, to, feo, an, oxygen, deficient, condition, called, a, reducing, atmosphere, is, generated, by, preventing, the, complete, combustion, of, the, kiln, fuel, this, is, achieved, by, deliberately, restricting, the, supply, of, air, or, by, supplying, an, excess, of, fuel, firing, pottery, can, be, done, using, a, variety, of, methods, with, a, kiln, being, the, usual, firing, method, both, the, maximum, temperature, and, the, duration, of, firing, influences, the, final, characteristics, of, the, ceramic, thus, the, maximum, temperature, within, a, kiln, is, often, held, constant, for, a, period, of, time, to, soak, the, wares, to, produce, the, maturity, required, in, the, body, of, the, wares, kilns, may, be, heated, by, burning, combustible, materials, such, as, wood, coal, and, gas, or, by, electricity, the, use, of, microwave, energy, has, been, investigated, when, used, as, fuels, coal, and, wood, can, introduce, smoke, soot, and, ash, into, the, kiln, which, can, affect, the, appearance, of, unprotected, wares, for, this, reason, wares, fired, in, wood, or, coal, fired, kilns, are, often, placed, in, the, kiln, in, saggars, ceramic, boxes, to, protect, them, modern, kilns, fuelled, by, gas, or, electricity, are, cleaner, and, more, easily, controlled, than, older, wood, or, coal, fired, kilns, and, often, allow, shorter, firing, times, to, be, used, niche, techniques, include, pots, are, positioned, on, and, amid, the, branches, and, then, grass, is, piled, high, to, complete, the, mound, although, the, mound, contains, the, pots, of, many, women, who, are, related, through, their, husbands, extended, families, each, women, is, responsible, for, her, own, or, her, immediate, family, s, pots, within, the, mound, when, a, mound, is, completed, and, the, ground, around, has, been, swept, clean, of, residual, combustible, material, a, senior, potter, lights, the, fire, a, handful, of, grass, is, lit, and, the, woman, runs, around, the, circumference, of, the, mound, touching, the, burning, torch, to, the, dried, grass, some, mounds, are, still, being, constructed, as, others, are, already, burning, pottery, may, be, decorated, in, many, different, ways, some, decoration, can, be, done, before, or, after, the, firing, and, may, be, undertaken, before, or, after, glazing, glaze, is, a, glassy, coating, on, pottery, and, reasons, to, use, it, include, decoration, ensuring, the, item, is, impermeable, to, liquids, and, minimizing, the, adherence, of, pollutants, glaze, may, be, applied, by, spraying, dipping, trailing, or, brushing, on, an, aqueous, suspension, of, the, unfired, glaze, the, colour, of, a, glaze, after, it, has, been, fired, may, be, significantly, different, from, before, firing, to, prevent, glazed, wares, sticking, to, kiln, furniture, during, firing, either, a, small, part, of, the, object, being, fired, for, example, the, foot, is, left, unglazed, or, alternatively, special, refractory, spurs, are, used, as, supports, these, are, removed, and, discarded, after, the, firing, some, specialised, glazing, techniques, include, although, many, of, the, environmental, effects, of, pottery, production, have, existed, for, millennia, some, of, these, have, been, amplified, with, modern, technology, and, scales, of, production, the, principal, factors, for, consideration, fall, into, two, categories, historically, lead, poisoning, plumbism, was, a, significant, health, concern, to, those, glazing, pottery, this, was, recognised, at, least, as, early, as, the, nineteenth, century, the, first, legislation, in, the, uk, to, limit, pottery, workers, exposure, to, lead, was, included, in, the, factories, act, extension, act, in, 1864, with, further, introduced, in, 1899, silicosis, is, an, occupational, lung, disease, caused, by, inhaling, large, amounts, of, crystalline, silica, dust, usually, over, many, years, workers, in, the, ceramic, industry, can, develop, it, due, to, exposure, to, silica, dust, in, the, raw, materials, colloquially, it, has, been, known, as, potter, s, rot, less, than, 10, years, after, its, introduction, in, 1720, as, a, raw, material, to, the, british, ceramics, industry, the, negative, effects, of, calcined, flint, on, the, lungs, of, workers, had, been, noted, in, one, study, reported, in, 2022, of, 106, uk, pottery, workers, 55, per, cent, had, at, least, some, stage, of, silicosis, exposure, to, siliceous, dusts, is, reduced, by, either, processing, and, using, the, source, materials, as, aqueous, suspension, or, as, damp, solids, or, by, the, use, of, dust, control, measures, such, as, local, exhaust, ventilation, these, have, been, mandated, by, legislation, such, as, the, pottery, health, and, welfare, special, regulations, 1950, the, health, and, safety, executive, in, the, uk, has, produced, guidelines, on, controlling, exposure, to, respirable, crystalline, silica, in, potteries, and, the, british, ceramics, federation, provide, as, a, free, download, a, guidance, booklet, archived, 2023, 04, 19, at, the, wayback, machine, environmental, concerns, include, off, site, water, pollution, air, pollution, disposal, of, hazardous, materials, disposal, of, rejected, ware, and, fuel, consumption, a, great, part, of, the, history, of, pottery, is, prehistoric, part, of, past, pre, literate, cultures, therefore, much, of, this, history, can, only, be, found, among, the, artifacts, of, archaeology, because, pottery, is, so, durable, pottery, and, shards, of, pottery, survive, for, millennia, at, archaeological, sites, and, are, typically, the, most, common, and, important, type, of, artifact, to, survive, many, prehistoric, cultures, are, named, after, the, pottery, that, is, the, easiest, way, to, identify, their, sites, and, archaeologists, develop, the, ability, to, recognise, different, types, from, the, chemistry, of, small, shards, before, pottery, becomes, part, of, a, culture, several, conditions, must, generally, be, met, pottery, may, well, have, been, discovered, independently, in, various, places, probably, by, accidentally, creating, it, at, the, bottom, of, fires, on, a, clay, soil, the, earliest, known, ceramic, objects, are, gravettian, figurines, such, as, those, discovered, at, doln, v, stonice, in, the, modern, day, czech, republic, the, venus, of, doln, v, stonice, is, a, venus, figurine, a, statuette, of, a, nude, female, figure, dated, to, 29, 000, 25, 000, bc, gravettian, industry, but, there, is, no, evidence, of, pottery, vessels, from, this, period, weights, for, looms, or, fishing, nets, are, a, very, common, use, for, the, earliest, pottery, sherds, have, been, found, in, china, and, japan, from, a, period, between, 12, 000, and, perhaps, as, long, as, 18, 000, years, ago, as, of, 2012, the, earliest, pottery, vessels, found, anywhere, in, the, world, dating, to, 20, 000, to, 19, 000, years, before, the, present, was, found, at, xianren, cave, in, the, jiangxi, province, of, china, other, early, pottery, vessels, include, those, excavated, from, the, yuchanyan, cave, in, southern, china, dated, from, 16, 000, bc, and, those, found, in, the, amur, river, basin, in, the, russian, far, east, dated, from, 14, 000, bc, the, odai, yamamoto, i, site, belonging, to, the, j, mon, period, currently, has, the, oldest, pottery, in, japan, excavations, in, 1998, uncovered, earthenware, fragments, which, have, been, dated, as, early, as, 14, 500, bc, the, term, j, mon, means, cord, marked, in, japanese, this, refers, to, the, markings, made, on, the, vessels, and, figures, using, sticks, with, cords, during, their, production, recent, research, has, elucidated, how, j, mon, pottery, was, used, by, its, creators, it, appears, that, pottery, was, independently, developed, in, sub, saharan, africa, during, the, 10th, millennium, bc, with, findings, dating, to, at, least, 9, 400, bc, from, central, mali, and, in, south, america, during, the, 9, 000s, 7, 000s, bc, the, malian, finds, date, to, the, same, period, as, similar, finds, from, east, asia, the, triangle, between, siberia, china, and, japan, and, are, associated, in, both, regions, to, the, same, climatic, changes, at, the, end, of, the, ice, age, new, grassland, develops, enabling, hunter, gatherers, to, expand, their, habitat, met, independently, by, both, cultures, with, similar, developments, the, creation, of, pottery, for, the, storage, of, wild, cereals, pearl, millet, and, that, of, small, arrowheads, for, hunting, small, game, typical, of, grassland, alternatively, the, creation, of, pottery, in, the, case, of, the, incipient, j, mon, civilisation, could, be, due, to, the, intensive, exploitation, of, freshwater, and, marine, organisms, by, late, glacial, foragers, who, started, developing, ceramic, containers, for, their, catch, in, japan, the, j, mon, period, has, a, long, history, of, development, of, j, mon, pottery, which, was, characterized, by, impressions, of, rope, on, the, surface, of, the, pottery, created, by, pressing, rope, into, the, clay, before, firing, glazed, stoneware, was, being, created, as, early, as, the, 15th, century, bc, in, china, a, form, of, chinese, porcelain, became, a, significant, chinese, export, from, the, tang, dynasty, ad, 618, 906, onwards, korean, potters, adopted, porcelain, as, early, as, the, 14th, century, ad, the, ceramic, industry, has, developed, greatly, since,
