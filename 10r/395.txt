drilling, is, a, cutting, process, where, a, drill, bit, is, spun, to, cut, a, hole, of, circular, cross, section, in, solid, materials, the, drill, bit, is, usually, a, rotary, cutting, tool, often, multi, point, the, bit, is, pressed, against, the, work, piece, and, rotated, at, rates, from, hundreds, to, thousands, of, revolutions, per, minute, this, forces, the, cutting, edge, against, the, work, piece, cutting, off, chips, swarf, from, the, hole, as, it, is, drilled, in, rock, drilling, the, hole, is, usually, not, made, through, a, circular, cutting, motion, though, the, bit, is, usually, rotated, instead, the, hole, is, usually, made, by, hammering, a, drill, bit, into, the, hole, with, quickly, repeated, short, movements, the, hammering, action, can, be, performed, from, outside, the, hole, top, hammer, drill, or, within, the, hole, down, the, hole, drill, dth, drills, used, for, horizontal, drilling, are, called, drifter, drills, in, rare, cases, specially, shaped, bits, are, used, to, cut, holes, of, non, circular, cross, section, a, square, cross, section, is, possible, drilled, holes, are, characterized, by, their, sharp, edge, on, the, entrance, side, and, the, presence, of, burrs, on, the, exit, side, unless, they, have, been, removed, also, the, inside, of, the, hole, usually, has, helical, feed, marks, drilling, may, affect, the, mechanical, properties, of, the, workpiece, by, creating, low, residual, stresses, around, the, hole, opening, and, a, very, thin, layer, of, highly, stressed, and, disturbed, material, on, the, newly, formed, surface, this, causes, the, workpiece, to, become, more, susceptible, to, corrosion, and, crack, propagation, at, the, stressed, surface, a, finish, operation, may, be, done, to, avoid, these, detrimental, conditions, for, fluted, drill, bits, any, chips, are, removed, via, the, flutes, chips, may, form, long, spirals, or, small, flakes, depending, on, the, material, and, process, parameters, the, type, of, chips, formed, can, be, an, indicator, of, the, machinability, of, the, material, with, long, chips, suggesting, good, material, machinability, when, possible, drilled, holes, should, be, located, perpendicular, to, the, workpiece, surface, this, minimizes, the, drill, bit, s, tendency, to, walk, that, is, to, be, deflected, from, the, intended, center, line, of, the, bore, causing, the, hole, to, be, misplaced, the, higher, the, length, to, diameter, ratio, of, the, drill, bit, the, greater, the, tendency, to, walk, the, tendency, to, walk, is, also, preempted, in, various, other, ways, which, include, surface, finish, produced, by, drilling, may, range, from, 32, to, 500, microinches, finish, cuts, will, generate, surfaces, near, 32, microinches, and, roughing, will, be, near, 500, microinches, cutting, fluid, is, commonly, used, to, cool, the, drill, bit, increase, tool, life, increase, speeds, and, feeds, increase, the, surface, finish, and, aid, in, ejecting, chips, application, of, these, fluids, is, usually, done, by, flooding, the, workpiece, with, coolant, and, lubricant, or, by, applying, a, spray, mist, in, deciding, which, drill, s, to, use, it, is, important, to, consider, the, task, at, hand, and, evaluate, which, drill, would, best, accomplish, the, task, there, are, a, variety, of, drill, styles, that, each, serve, a, different, purpose, the, subland, drill, is, capable, of, drilling, more, than, one, diameter, the, spade, drill, is, used, to, drill, larger, hole, sizes, the, indexable, drill, is, useful, in, managing, chips, the, purpose, of, spot, drilling, is, to, drill, a, hole, that, will, act, as, a, guide, for, drilling, the, final, hole, the, hole, is, only, drilled, part, way, into, the, workpiece, because, it, is, only, used, to, guide, the, beginning, of, the, next, drilling, process, centre, drill, is, a, two, fluted, tool, consisting, of, a, twist, drill, with, a, 60, countersink, used, to, drill, countersink, center, holes, in, a, workpiece, to, be, mounted, between, centers, for, turning, or, grinding, deep, hole, drilling, is, defined, as, drilling, a, hole, of, depth, greater, than, ten, times, the, diameter, of, the, hole, these, types, of, holes, require, special, equipment, to, maintain, the, straightness, and, tolerances, other, considerations, are, roundness, and, surface, finish, deep, hole, drilling, is, generally, achievable, with, a, few, tooling, methods, usually, gun, drilling, or, bta, drilling, these, are, differentiated, due, to, the, coolant, entry, method, internal, or, external, and, chip, removal, method, internal, or, external, using, methods, such, as, a, rotating, tool, and, counter, rotating, workpiece, are, common, techniques, to, achieve, required, straightness, tolerances, secondary, tooling, methods, include, trepanning, skiving, and, burnishing, pull, boring, or, bottle, boring, finally, a, new, kind, of, drilling, technology, is, available, to, face, this, issue, vibration, drilling, this, technology, breaks, up, the, chips, by, a, small, controlled, axial, vibration, of, the, drill, the, small, chips, are, easily, removed, by, the, flutes, of, the, drill, a, high, tech, monitoring, system, is, used, to, control, force, torque, vibrations, and, acoustic, emission, vibration, is, considered, a, major, defect, in, deep, hole, drilling, which, can, often, cause, the, drill, to, break, a, special, coolant, is, usually, used, to, aid, in, this, type, of, drilling, gun, drilling, was, originally, developed, to, drill, out, gun, barrels, and, is, used, commonly, for, drilling, smaller, diameter, deep, holes, the, depth, to, diameter, ratio, can, be, even, greater, than, 300, 1, the, key, feature, of, gun, drilling, is, that, the, bits, are, self, centering, this, is, what, allows, for, such, deep, accurate, holes, the, bits, use, a, rotary, motion, similar, to, a, twist, drill, however, the, bits, are, designed, with, bearing, pads, that, slide, along, the, surface, of, the, hole, keeping, the, drill, bit, on, center, gun, drilling, is, usually, done, at, high, speeds, and, low, feed, rates, trepanning, is, commonly, used, for, creating, larger, diameter, holes, up, to, 915, mm, 36, 0, in, where, a, standard, drill, bit, is, not, feasible, or, economical, trepanning, removes, the, desired, diameter, by, cutting, out, a, solid, disk, similar, to, the, workings, of, a, drafting, compass, trepanning, is, performed, on, flat, products, such, as, sheet, metal, granite, curling, stone, plates, or, structural, members, like, i, beams, trepanning, can, also, be, useful, to, make, grooves, for, inserting, seals, such, as, o, rings, microdrilling, refers, to, the, drilling, of, holes, less, than, 0, 5, mm, 0, 020, in, drilling, of, holes, at, this, small, diameter, presents, greater, problems, since, coolant, fed, drills, cannot, be, used, and, high, spindle, speeds, are, required, high, spindle, speeds, that, exceed, 10, 000, rpm, also, require, the, use, of, balanced, tool, holders, the, first, studies, into, vibration, drilling, began, in, the, 1950s, pr, v, n, poduraev, moscow, bauman, university, the, main, principle, consists, in, generating, axial, vibrations, or, oscillations, in, addition, to, the, feed, movement, of, the, drill, so, that, the, chips, break, up, and, are, then, easily, removed, from, the, cutting, zone, there, are, two, main, technologies, of, vibration, drilling, self, maintained, vibration, systems, and, forced, vibration, systems, most, vibration, drilling, technologies, are, still, at, a, research, stage, in, the, case, of, self, maintained, vibration, drilling, the, eigenfrequency, of, the, tool, is, used, in, order, to, make, it, naturally, vibrate, while, cutting, vibrations, are, self, maintained, by, a, mass, spring, system, included, in, the, tool, holder, other, works, use, a, piezoelectric, system, to, generate, and, control, the, vibrations, these, systems, allow, high, vibration, frequencies, up, to, 2, khz, for, small, magnitude, about, a, few, micrometers, they, are, particularly, suitable, for, drilling, small, holes, finally, vibrations, can, be, generated, by, mechanical, systems, the, frequency, is, given, by, the, combination, of, the, rotation, speed, and, the, number, of, oscillation, per, rotation, a, few, oscillations, per, rotation, with, magnitude, about, 0, 1, mm, this, last, technology, is, a, fully, industrial, one, example, sineholing, technology, of, mitis, vibration, drilling, is, a, preferred, solution, in, situations, like, deep, hole, drilling, multi, material, stack, drilling, aeronautics, and, dry, drilling, without, lubrication, generally, it, provides, improved, reliability, and, greater, control, of, the, drilling, operation, circle, interpolating, also, known, as, orbital, drilling, is, a, process, for, creating, holes, using, machine, cutters, orbital, drilling, is, based, on, rotating, a, cutting, tool, around, its, own, axis, and, simultaneously, about, a, centre, axis, which, is, off, set, from, the, axis, of, the, cutting, tool, the, cutting, tool, can, then, be, moved, simultaneously, in, an, axial, direction, to, drill, or, machine, a, hole, and, or, combined, with, an, arbitrary, sidewards, motion, to, machine, an, opening, or, cavity, by, adjusting, the, offset, a, cutting, tool, of, a, specific, diameter, can, be, used, to, drill, holes, of, different, diameters, as, illustrated, this, implies, that, the, cutting, tool, inventory, can, be, substantially, reduced, the, term, orbital, drilling, comes, from, that, the, cutting, tool, orbits, around, the, hole, center, the, mechanically, forced, dynamic, offset, in, orbital, drilling, has, several, advantages, compared, to, conventional, drilling, that, drastically, increases, the, hole, precision, the, lower, thrust, force, results, in, a, burr, less, hole, when, drilling, in, metals, when, drilling, in, composite, materials, the, problem, with, delamination, is, eliminated, under, normal, usage, swarf, is, carried, up, and, away, from, the, tip, of, the, drill, bit, by, the, fluting, of, the, drill, bit, the, cutting, edges, produce, more, chips, which, continue, the, movement, of, the, chips, outwards, from, the, hole, this, is, successful, until, the, chips, pack, too, tightly, either, because, of, deeper, than, normal, holes, or, insufficient, backing, off, removing, the, drill, slightly, or, totally, from, the, hole, while, drilling, cutting, fluid, is, sometimes, used, to, ease, this, problem, and, to, prolong, the, tool, s, life, by, cooling, and, lubricating, the, tip, and, chip, flow, coolant, may, be, introduced, via, holes, through, the, drill, shank, which, is, common, when, using, a, gun, drill, when, cutting, aluminum, in, particular, cutting, fluid, helps, ensure, a, smooth, and, accurate, hole, while, preventing, the, metal, from, grabbing, the, drill, bit, in, the, process, of, drilling, the, hole, when, cutting, brass, and, other, soft, metals, that, can, grab, the, drill, bit, and, causes, chatter, a, face, of, approx, 1, 2, millimeters, can, be, ground, on, the, cutting, edge, to, create, an, obtuse, angle, of, 91, to, 93, degrees, this, prevents, chatter, during, which, the, drill, tears, rather, than, cuts, the, metal, however, with, that, shape, of, bit, cutting, edge, the, drill, is, pushing, the, metal, away, rather, than, grabbing, the, metal, this, creates, high, friction, and, very, hot, swarf, for, heavy, feeds, and, comparatively, deep, holes, oil, hole, drills, are, used, in, the, drill, bit, with, a, lubricant, pumped, to, the, drill, head, through, a, small, hole, in, the, bit, and, flowing, out, along, the, fluting, a, conventional, drill, press, arrangement, can, be, used, in, oil, hole, drilling, but, it, is, more, commonly, seen, in, automatic, drilling, machinery, in, which, it, is, the, workpiece, that, rotates, rather, than, the, drill, bit, in, computer, numerical, control, cnc, machine, tools, a, process, called, peck, drilling, or, interrupted, cut, drilling, is, used, to, keep, swarf, from, detrimentally, building, up, when, drilling, deep, holes, approximately, when, the, depth, of, the, hole, is, three, times, greater, than, the, drill, diameter, peck, drilling, involves, plunging, the, drill, part, way, through, the, workpiece, no, more, than, five, times, the, diameter, of, the, drill, and, then, retracting, it, to, the, surface, this, is, repeated, until, the, hole, is, finished, a, modified, form, of, this, process, called, high, speed, peck, drilling, or, chip, breaking, only, retracts, the, drill, slightly, this, process, is, faster, but, is, only, used, in, moderately, long, holes, otherwise, it, will, overheat, the, drill, bit, it, is, also, used, when, drilling, stringy, material, to, break, the, chips, when, it, is, not, possible, to, bring, the, material, to, the, n, machine, a, magnetic, base, drilling, machine, may, be, used, the, base, allows, drilling, in, a, horizontal, position, and, even, on, a, ceiling, usually, for, these, machines, it, is, better, to, use, cutters, because, they, can, drill, much, faster, with, less, speed, cutter, sizes, vary, from, 12mm, to, 200mm, dia, and, from, 30mm, to, 200mm, doc, depth, of, cut, these, machines, are, widely, used, in, construction, fabrication, marine, and, oil, gas, industries, in, the, oil, and, gas, industry, pneumatic, magnetic, drilling, machines, are, used, to, avoid, sparks, as, well, as, special, tube, magnetic, drilling, machines, that, can, be, fixed, on, pipes, of, different, sizes, even, inside, heavy, duty, plate, drilling, machines, provide, high, quality, solutions, in, the, manufacturing, of, steel, construction, bridge, construction, shipyards, and, various, fields, of, the, construction, sector, wood, being, softer, than, most, metals, drilling, in, wood, is, considerably, easier, and, faster, than, drilling, in, metal, cutting, fluids, are, not, used, or, needed, the, main, issue, in, drilling, wood, is, ensuring, clean, entry, and, exit, holes, and, preventing, burning, avoiding, burning, is, a, question, of, using, sharp, bits, and, the, appropriate, cutting, speed, drill, bits, can, tear, out, chips, of, wood, around, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, hole, and, this, is, undesirable, in, fine, woodworking, applications, the, ubiquitous, twist, drill, bits, used, in, metalworking, also, work, well, in, wood, but, they, tend, to, chip, wood, out, at, the, entry, and, exit, of, the, hole, in, some, cases, as, in, holes, for, rough, carpentry, the, quality, of, the, hole, does, not, matter, and, a, number, of, bits, for, fast, cutting, in, wood, exist, including, spade, bits, and, self, feeding, auger, bits, many, types, of, specialised, drill, bits, for, boring, clean, holes, in, wood, have, been, developed, including, brad, point, bits, forstner, bits, and, hole, saws, chipping, on, exit, can, be, minimized, by, using, a, piece, of, wood, as, backing, behind, the, work, piece, and, the, same, technique, is, sometimes, used, to, keep, the, hole, entry, neat, holes, are, easier, to, start, in, wood, as, the, drill, bit, can, be, accurately, positioned, by, pushing, it, into, the, wood, and, creating, a, dimple, the, bit, will, thus, have, little, tendency, to, wander, some, materials, like, plastics, as, well, as, other, non, metals, and, some, metals, have, a, tendency, to, heat, up, enough, to, expand, making, the, hole, smaller, than, desired, the, following, are, some, related, processes, that, often, accompany, drilling
