software, engineering, is, an, engineering, approach, to, software, development, a, practitioner, called, a, software, engineer, applies, the, engineering, design, process, to, develop, software, the, terms, programmer, and, coder, overlap, software, engineer, but, they, imply, only, the, construction, aspect, of, typical, software, engineer, workload, a, software, engineer, applies, a, software, development, process, which, involves, defining, implementing, testing, managing, and, maintaining, software, systems, and, creating, and, modifying, the, development, process, beginning, in, the, 1960s, software, engineering, was, recognized, as, a, separate, field, of, engineering, the, development, of, software, engineering, was, seen, as, a, struggle, problems, included, software, that, was, over, budget, exceeded, deadlines, required, extensive, debugging, and, maintenance, and, unsuccessfully, met, the, needs, of, consumers, or, was, never, even, completed, in, 1968, nato, held, the, first, software, engineering, conference, where, issues, related, to, software, were, addressed, guidelines, and, best, practices, for, the, development, of, software, were, established, the, origins, of, the, term, software, engineering, have, been, attributed, to, various, sources, the, term, appeared, in, a, list, of, services, offered, by, companies, in, the, june, 1965, issue, of, computers, and, automation, and, was, used, more, formally, in, the, august, 1966, issue, of, communications, of, the, acm, volume, 9, number, 8, in, president, s, letter, to, the, acm, membership, by, anthony, a, oettinger, it, is, also, associated, with, the, title, of, a, nato, conference, in, 1968, by, professor, friedrich, l, bauer, margaret, hamilton, described, the, discipline, of, software, engineering, during, the, apollo, missions, to, give, what, they, were, doing, legitimacy, at, the, time, there, was, perceived, to, be, a, software, crisis, the, 40th, international, conference, on, software, engineering, icse, 2018, celebrates, 50, years, of, software, engineering, with, the, plenary, sessions, keynotes, of, frederick, brooks, and, margaret, hamilton, in, 1984, the, software, engineering, institute, sei, was, established, as, a, federally, funded, research, and, development, center, headquartered, on, the, campus, of, carnegie, mellon, university, in, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, united, states, watts, humphrey, founded, the, sei, software, process, program, aimed, at, understanding, and, managing, the, software, engineering, process, the, process, maturity, levels, introduced, became, the, capability, maturity, model, integration, for, development, cmmi, dev, which, defined, how, the, us, government, evaluates, the, abilities, of, a, software, development, team, modern, generally, accepted, best, practices, for, software, engineering, have, been, collected, by, the, iso, iec, jtc, 1, sc, 7, subcommittee, and, published, as, the, software, engineering, body, of, knowledge, swebok, software, engineering, is, considered, one, of, the, major, computing, disciplines, notable, definitions, of, software, engineering, include, the, term, has, also, been, used, less, formally, margaret, hamilton, promoted, the, term, software, engineering, during, her, work, on, the, apollo, program, the, term, engineering, was, used, to, acknowledge, that, the, work, should, be, taken, just, as, seriously, as, other, contributions, toward, the, advancement, of, technology, hamilton, details, her, use, of, the, term, when, i, first, came, up, with, the, term, no, one, had, heard, of, it, before, at, least, in, our, world, it, was, an, ongoing, joke, for, a, long, time, they, liked, to, kid, me, about, my, radical, ideas, it, was, a, memorable, day, when, one, of, the, most, respected, hardware, gurus, explained, to, everyone, in, a, meeting, that, he, agreed, with, me, that, the, process, of, building, software, should, also, be, considered, an, engineering, discipline, just, like, with, hardware, not, because, of, his, acceptance, of, the, new, term, per, se, but, because, we, had, earned, his, and, the, acceptance, of, the, others, in, the, room, as, being, in, an, engineering, field, in, its, own, right, individual, commentators, have, disagreed, sharply, on, how, to, define, software, engineering, or, its, legitimacy, as, an, engineering, discipline, david, parnas, has, said, that, software, engineering, is, in, fact, a, form, of, engineering, steve, mcconnell, has, said, that, it, is, not, but, that, it, should, be, donald, knuth, has, said, that, programming, is, an, art, and, a, science, edsger, w, dijkstra, claimed, that, the, terms, software, engineering, and, software, engineer, have, been, misused, in, the, united, states, requirements, engineering, is, about, elicitation, analysis, specification, and, validation, of, requirements, for, software, software, requirements, can, be, functional, non, functional, or, domain, functional, requirements, describe, expected, behaviors, i, e, outputs, non, functional, requirements, specify, issues, like, portability, security, maintainability, reliability, scalability, performance, reusability, and, flexibility, they, are, classified, into, the, following, types, interface, constraints, performance, constraints, such, as, response, time, security, storage, space, etc, operating, constraints, life, cycle, constraints, maintainability, portability, etc, and, economic, constraints, knowledge, of, how, the, system, or, software, works, is, needed, when, it, comes, to, specifying, non, functional, requirements, domain, requirements, have, to, do, with, the, characteristic, of, a, certain, category, or, domain, of, projects, software, design, is, the, process, of, making, high, level, plans, for, the, software, design, is, sometimes, divided, into, levels, software, construction, typically, involves, programming, a, k, a, coding, unit, testing, integration, testing, and, debugging, so, as, to, implement, the, design, software, testing, is, related, to, but, different, from, debugging, testing, during, this, phase, is, generally, performed, by, the, programmer, and, with, the, purpose, to, verify, that, the, code, behaves, as, designed, and, to, know, when, the, code, is, ready, for, the, next, level, of, testing, software, testing, is, an, empirical, technical, investigation, conducted, to, provide, stakeholders, with, information, about, the, quality, of, the, software, under, test, when, described, separately, from, construction, testing, typically, is, performed, by, test, engineers, or, quality, assurance, instead, of, the, programmers, who, wrote, it, it, is, performed, at, the, system, level, and, is, considered, an, aspect, of, software, quality, program, analysis, is, the, process, of, analyzing, computer, programs, with, respect, to, an, aspect, such, as, performance, robustness, and, security, software, maintenance, refers, to, supporting, the, software, after, release, it, may, include, but, is, not, limited, to, error, correction, optimization, deletion, of, unused, and, discarded, features, and, enhancement, of, existing, features, usually, maintenance, takes, up, 40, to, 80, of, project, cost, knowledge, of, computer, programming, is, a, prerequisite, for, becoming, a, software, engineer, in, 2004, the, ieee, computer, society, produced, the, swebok, which, has, been, published, as, iso, iec, technical, report, 1979, 2005, describing, the, body, of, knowledge, that, they, recommend, to, be, mastered, by, a, graduate, software, engineer, with, four, years, of, experience, many, software, engineers, enter, the, profession, by, obtaining, a, university, degree, or, training, at, a, vocational, school, one, standard, international, curriculum, for, undergraduate, software, engineering, degrees, was, defined, by, the, joint, task, force, on, computing, curricula, of, the, ieee, computer, society, and, the, association, for, computing, machinery, and, updated, in, 2014, a, number, of, universities, have, software, engineering, degree, programs, as, of, 2010, there, were, 244, campus, bachelor, of, software, engineering, programs, 70, online, programs, 230, masters, level, programs, 41, doctorate, level, programs, and, 69, certificate, level, programs, in, the, united, states, in, addition, to, university, education, many, companies, sponsor, internships, for, students, wishing, to, pursue, careers, in, information, technology, these, internships, can, introduce, the, student, to, real, world, tasks, that, typical, software, engineers, encounter, every, day, similar, experience, can, be, gained, through, military, service, in, software, engineering, half, of, all, practitioners, today, have, degrees, in, computer, science, information, systems, or, information, technology, a, small, but, growing, number, of, practitioners, have, software, engineering, degrees, in, 1987, the, department, of, computing, at, imperial, college, london, introduced, the, first, three, year, software, engineering, bachelor, s, degree, in, the, world, in, the, following, year, the, university, of, sheffield, established, a, similar, program, in, 1996, the, rochester, institute, of, technology, established, the, first, software, engineering, bachelor, s, degree, program, in, the, united, states, however, it, did, not, obtain, abet, accreditation, until, 2003, the, same, year, as, rice, university, clarkson, university, milwaukee, school, of, engineering, and, mississippi, state, university, in, 1997, psg, college, of, technology, in, coimbatore, india, was, the, first, to, start, a, five, year, integrated, master, of, science, degree, in, software, engineering, since, then, software, engineering, undergraduate, degrees, have, been, established, at, many, universities, a, standard, international, curriculum, for, undergraduate, software, engineering, degrees, se2004, was, defined, by, a, steering, committee, between, 2001, and, 2004, with, funding, from, the, association, for, computing, machinery, and, the, ieee, computer, society, as, of, 2004, about, 50, universities, in, the, u, s, offer, software, engineering, degrees, which, teach, both, computer, science, and, engineering, principles, and, practices, the, first, software, engineering, master, s, degree, was, established, at, seattle, university, in, 1979, since, then, graduate, software, engineering, degrees, have, been, made, available, from, many, more, universities, likewise, in, canada, the, canadian, engineering, accreditation, board, ceab, of, the, canadian, council, of, professional, engineers, has, recognized, several, software, engineering, programs, in, 1998, the, us, naval, postgraduate, school, nps, established, the, first, doctorate, program, in, software, engineering, in, the, world, additionally, many, online, advanced, degrees, in, software, engineering, have, appeared, such, as, the, master, of, science, in, software, engineering, mse, degree, offered, through, the, computer, science, and, engineering, department, at, california, state, university, fullerton, steve, mcconnell, opines, that, because, most, universities, teach, computer, science, rather, than, software, engineering, there, is, a, shortage, of, true, software, engineers, ets, cole, de, technologie, sup, rieure, university, and, uqam, universit, du, qu, bec, montr, al, were, mandated, by, ieee, to, develop, the, software, engineering, body, of, knowledge, swebok, which, has, become, an, iso, standard, describing, the, body, of, knowledge, covered, by, a, software, engineer, legal, requirements, for, the, licensing, or, certification, of, professional, software, engineers, vary, around, the, world, in, the, uk, there, is, no, licensing, or, legal, requirement, to, assume, or, use, the, job, title, software, engineer, in, some, areas, of, canada, such, as, alberta, british, columbia, ontario, and, quebec, software, engineers, can, hold, the, professional, engineer, p, eng, designation, and, or, the, information, systems, professional, i, s, p, designation, in, europe, software, engineers, can, obtain, the, european, engineer, eur, ing, professional, title, software, engineers, can, also, become, professionally, qualified, as, a, chartered, engineer, through, the, british, computer, society, in, the, united, states, the, ncees, began, offering, a, professional, engineer, exam, for, software, engineering, in, 2013, thereby, allowing, software, engineers, to, be, licensed, and, recognized, ncees, ended, the, exam, after, april, 2019, due, to, lack, of, participation, mandatory, licensing, is, currently, still, largely, debated, and, perceived, as, controversial, the, ieee, computer, society, and, the, acm, the, two, main, us, based, professional, organizations, of, software, engineering, publish, guides, to, the, profession, of, software, engineering, the, ieee, s, guide, to, the, software, engineering, body, of, knowledge, 2004, version, or, swebok, defines, the, field, and, describes, the, knowledge, the, ieee, expects, a, practicing, software, engineer, to, have, the, most, current, swebok, v3, is, an, updated, version, and, was, released, in, 2014, the, ieee, also, promulgates, a, software, engineering, code, of, ethics, there, are, an, estimated, 26, 9, million, professional, software, engineers, in, the, world, as, of, 2022, up, from, 21, million, in, 2016, many, software, engineers, work, as, employees, or, contractors, software, engineers, work, with, businesses, government, agencies, civilian, or, military, and, non, profit, organizations, some, software, engineers, work, for, themselves, as, freelancers, some, organizations, have, specialists, to, perform, each, of, the, tasks, in, the, software, development, process, other, organizations, require, software, engineers, to, do, many, or, all, of, them, in, large, projects, people, may, specialize, in, only, one, role, in, small, projects, people, may, fill, several, or, all, roles, at, the, same, time, many, companies, hire, interns, often, university, or, college, students, during, a, summer, break, or, externships, specializations, include, analysts, architects, developers, testers, technical, support, middleware, analysts, project, managers, software, product, managers, educators, and, researchers, most, software, engineers, and, programmers, work, 40, hours, a, week, but, about, 15, percent, of, software, engineers, and, 11, percent, of, programmers, worked, more, than, 50, hours, a, week, in, 2008, potential, injuries, in, these, occupations, are, possible, because, like, other, workers, who, spend, long, periods, sitting, in, front, of, a, computer, terminal, typing, at, a, keyboard, engineers, and, programmers, are, susceptible, to, eyestrain, back, discomfort, and, hand, and, wrist, problems, such, as, carpal, tunnel, syndrome, the, u, s, bureau, of, labor, statistics, bls, counted, 1, 365, 500, software, developers, holding, jobs, in, the, u, s, in, 2018, due, to, its, relative, newness, as, a, field, of, study, formal, education, in, software, engineering, is, often, taught, as, part, of, a, computer, science, curriculum, and, many, software, engineers, hold, computer, science, degrees, the, bls, estimates, from, 2014, to, 2024, that, computer, software, engineering, would, increase, by, 17, this, is, down, from, the, 2012, to, 2022, bls, estimate, of, 22, for, software, engineering, and, is, further, down, from, their, 30, 2010, to, 2020, bls, estimate, due, to, this, trend, job, growth, may, not, be, as, fast, as, during, the, last, decade, as, jobs, that, would, have, gone, to, computer, software, engineers, in, the, united, states, would, instead, be, outsourced, to, computer, software, engineers, in, countries, such, as, india, and, other, foreign, countries, in, addition, the, bls, job, outlook, for, computer, programmers, the, u, s, bureau, of, labor, statistics, bls, occupational, outlook, predicts, a, decline, of, 7, percent, from, 2016, to, 2026, a, further, decline, of, 9, percent, from, 2019, to, 2029, a, decline, of, 10, percent, from, 2021, to, 2031, and, then, a, decline, of, 11, percent, from, 2022, to, 2032, since, computer, programming, can, be, done, from, anywhere, in, the, world, companies, sometimes, hire, programmers, in, countries, where, wages, are, lower, furthermore, women, in, many, software, fields, has, also, been, declining, over, the, years, as, compared, to, other, engineering, fields, then, there, is, the, additional, concern, that, recent, advances, in, artificial, intelligence, might, impact, the, demand, for, future, generations, of, software, engineers, however, this, trend, may, change, or, slow, in, the, future, as, many, current, software, engineers, in, the, u, s, market, flee, the, profession, or, age, out, of, the, market, in, the, next, few, decades, the, software, engineering, institute, offers, certifications, on, specific, topics, like, security, process, improvement, and, software, architecture, ibm, microsoft, and, other, companies, also, sponsor, their, own, certification, examinations, many, it, certification, programs, are, oriented, toward, specific, technologies, and, managed, by, the, vendors, of, these, technologies, these, certification, programs, are, tailored, to, the, institutions, that, would, employ, people, who, use, these, technologies, broader, certification, of, general, software, engineering, skills, is, available, through, various, professional, societies, as, of, 2006, the, ieee, had, certified, over, 575, software, professionals, as, a, certified, software, development, professional, csdp, in, 2008, they, added, an, entry, level, certification, known, as, the, certified, software, development, associate, csda, the, acm, had, a, professional, certification, program, in, the, early, 1980s, which, was, discontinued, due, to, lack, of, interest, the, acm, and, the, ieee, computer, society, together, examined, the, possibility, of, licensing, of, software, engineers, as, professional, engineers, in, the, 1990s, but, eventually, decided, that, such, licensing, was, inappropriate, for, the, professional, industrial, practice, of, software, engineering, john, c, knight, and, nancy, g, leveson, presented, a, more, balanced, analysis, of, the, licensing, issue, in, 2002, in, the, u, k, the, british, computer, society, has, developed, a, legally, recognized, professional, certification, called, chartered, it, professional, citp, available, to, fully, qualified, members, mbcs, software, engineers, may, be, eligible, for, membership, of, the, british, computer, society, or, institution, of, engineering, and, technology, and, so, qualify, to, be, considered, for, chartered, engineer, status, through, either, of, those, institutions, in, canada, the, canadian, information, processing, society, has, developed, a, legally, recognized, professional, certification, called, information, systems, professional, isp, in, ontario, canada, software, engineers, who, graduate, from, a, canadian, engineering, accreditation, board, ceab, accredited, program, successfully, complete, peo, s, professional, engineers, ontario, professional, practice, examination, ppe, and, have, at, least, 48, months, of, acceptable, engineering, experience, are, eligible, to, be, licensed, through, the, professional, engineers, ontario, and, can, become, professional, engineers, p, eng, the, peo, does, not, recognize, any, online, or, distance, education, however, and, does, not, consider, computer, science, programs, to, be, equivalent, to, software, engineering, programs, despite, the, tremendous, overlap, between, the, two, this, has, sparked, controversy, and, a, certification, war, it, has, also, held, the, number, of, p, eng, holders, for, the, profession, exceptionally, low, the, vast, majority, of, working, professionals, in, the, field, hold, a, degree, in, cs, not, se, given, the, difficult, certification, path, for, holders, of, non, se, degrees, most, never, bother, to, pursue, the, license, the, initial, impact, of, outsourcing, and, the, relatively, lower, cost, of, international, human, resources, in, developing, third, world, countries, led, to, a, massive, migration, of, software, development, activities, from, corporations, in, north, america, and, europe, to, india, and, later, china, russia, and, other, developing, countries, this, approach, had, some, flaws, mainly, the, distance, time, zone, difference, that, prevented, human, interaction, between, clients, and, developers, and, the, massive, job, transfer, this, had, a, negative, impact, on, many, aspects, of, the, software, engineering, profession, for, example, some, students, in, the, developed, world, avoid, education, related, to, software, engineering, because, of, the, fear, of, offshore, outsourcing, importing, software, products, or, services, from, other, countries, and, of, being, displaced, by, foreign, visa, workers, although, statistics, do, not, currently, show, a, threat, to, software, engineering, itself, a, related, career, computer, programming, does, appear, to, have, been, affected, nevertheless, the, ability, to, smartly, leverage, offshore, and, near, shore, resources, via, the, follow, the, sun, workflow, has, improved, the, overall, operational, capability, of, many, organizations, when, north, americans, leave, work, asians, are, just, arriving, to, work, when, asians, are, leaving, work, europeans, arrive, to, work, this, provides, a, continuous, ability, to, have, human, oversight, on, business, critical, processes, 24, hours, per, day, without, paying, overtime, compensation, or, disrupting, a, key, human, resource, sleep, patterns, while, global, outsourcing, has, several, advantages, global, and, generally, distributed, development, can, run, into, serious, difficulties, resulting, from, the, distance, between, developers, this, is, due, to, the, key, elements, of, this, type, of, distance, that, have, been, identified, as, geographical, temporal, cultural, and, communication, that, includes, the, use, of, different, languages, and, dialects, of, english, in, different, locations, research, has, been, carried, out, in, the, area, of, global, software, development, over, the, last, 15, years, and, an, extensive, body, of, relevant, work, published, that, highlights, the, benefits, and, problems, associated, with, the, complex, activity, as, with, other, aspects, of, software, engineering, research, is, ongoing, in, this, and, related, areas, there, are, various, prizes, in, the, field, of, software, engineering, some, call, for, licensing, certification, and, codified, bodies, of, knowledge, as, mechanisms, for, spreading, the, engineering, knowledge, and, maturing, the, field, some, claim, that, the, concept, of, software, engineering, is, so, new, that, it, is, rarely, understood, and, it, is, widely, misinterpreted, including, in, software, engineering, textbooks, papers, and, among, the, communities, of, programmers, and, crafters, some, claim, that, a, core, issue, with, software, engineering, is, that, its, approaches, are, not, empirical, enough, because, a, real, world, validation, of, approaches, is, usually, absent, or, very, limited, and, hence, software, engineering, is, often, misinterpreted, as, feasible, only, in, a, theoretical, environment, edsger, dijkstra, a, founder, of, many, of, the, concepts, in, software, development, today, rejected, the, idea, of, software, engineering, up, until, his, death, in, 2002, arguing, that, those, terms, were, poor, analogies, for, what, he, called, the, radical, novelty, of, computer, science, a, number, of, these, phenomena, have, been, bundled, under, the, name, software, engineering, as, economics, is, known, as, the, miserable, science, software, engineering, should, be, known, as, the, doomed, discipline, doomed, because, it, cannot, even, approach, its, goal, since, its, goal, is, self, contradictory, software, engineering, of, course, presents, itself, as, another, worthy, cause, but, that, is, eyewash, if, you, carefully, read, its, literature, and, analyse, what, its, devotees, actually, do, you, will, discover, that, software, engineering, has, accepted, as, its, charter, how, to, program, if, you, cannot
