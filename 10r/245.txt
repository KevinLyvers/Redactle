parchment, is, a, writing, material, made, from, specially, prepared, untanned, skins, of, animals, primarily, sheep, calves, and, goats, it, has, been, used, as, a, writing, medium, for, over, two, millennia, vellum, is, a, finer, quality, parchment, made, from, the, skins, of, young, animals, such, as, lambs, and, young, calves, it, is, sometimes, called, animal, membrane, by, libraries, and, museums, that, wish, to, avoid, distinguishing, between, parchment, and, the, more, restricted, term, vellum, see, below, the, word, is, derived, from, the, koin, greek, city, name, pergamum, in, anatolia, where, parchment, was, supposedly, first, developed, around, the, second, century, bce, probably, as, a, substitute, for, papyrus, today, the, term, parchment, is, often, used, in, non, technical, contexts, to, refer, to, any, animal, skin, particularly, goat, sheep, or, cow, that, has, been, scraped, or, dried, under, tension, the, term, originally, referred, only, to, the, skin, of, sheep, and, occasionally, goats, the, equivalent, material, made, from, calfskin, which, was, of, finer, quality, was, known, as, vellum, from, the, old, french, velin, or, vellin, and, ultimately, from, the, latin, vitulus, meaning, a, calf, while, the, finest, of, all, was, uterine, vellum, taken, from, a, calf, foetus, or, stillborn, calf, some, authorities, have, sought, to, observe, these, distinctions, strictly, for, example, lexicographer, samuel, johnson, in, 1755, and, master, calligrapher, edward, johnston, in, 1906, however, when, old, books, and, documents, are, encountered, it, may, be, difficult, without, scientific, analysis, to, determine, the, precise, animal, origin, of, a, skin, either, in, terms, of, its, species, or, in, terms, of, the, animal, s, age, in, practice, therefore, there, has, long, been, considerable, blurring, of, the, boundaries, between, the, different, terms, in, 1519, william, horman, wrote, in, his, vulgaria, that, stouffe, that, we, wrytte, upon, and, is, made, of, beestis, skynnes, is, somtyme, called, parchement, somtyme, velem, somtyme, abortyve, somtyme, membraan, in, shakespeare, s, hamlet, written, c, 1599, 1602, the, following, exchange, occurs, hamlet, is, not, parchment, made, of, sheepskins, horatio, ay, my, lord, and, of, calves, skins, too, lee, ustick, writing, in, 1936, commented, to, day, the, distinction, among, collectors, of, manuscripts, is, that, vellum, is, a, highly, refined, form, of, skin, parchment, a, cruder, form, usually, thick, harsh, less, highly, polished, than, vellum, but, with, no, distinction, between, skin, of, calf, or, sheep, or, of, goat, it, is, for, these, reasons, that, many, modern, conservators, librarians, and, archivists, prefer, to, use, either, the, broader, term, parchment, or, the, neutral, term, animal, membrane, the, word, parchment, evolved, via, the, latin, pergamenum, and, the, french, parchemin, from, the, name, of, the, city, of, pergamon, which, was, a, thriving, center, of, parchment, production, during, the, hellenistic, period, the, city, so, dominated, the, trade, that, a, legend, later, arose, which, said, that, parchment, had, been, invented, in, pergamon, to, replace, the, use, of, papyrus, which, had, become, monopolized, by, the, rival, city, of, alexandria, this, account, originating, in, the, writings, of, pliny, the, elder, natural, history, book, xiii, 69, 70, is, almost, assuredly, false, because, parchment, had, been, in, use, in, anatolia, and, elsewhere, long, before, the, rise, of, pergamon, herodotus, mentions, writing, on, skins, as, common, in, his, time, the, 5th, century, bc, and, in, his, histories, v, 58, he, states, that, the, ionians, of, asia, minor, had, been, accustomed, to, give, the, name, of, skins, diphtherai, to, books, this, word, was, adapted, by, hellenized, jews, to, describe, scrolls, writing, on, prepared, animal, skins, had, a, long, history, in, other, cultures, outside, of, the, greeks, as, well, david, diringer, noted, that, the, first, mention, of, egyptian, documents, written, on, leather, goes, back, to, the, fourth, dynasty, c, 2550, 2450, bc, but, the, earliest, of, such, documents, extant, are, a, fragmentary, roll, of, leather, of, the, sixth, dynasty, c, 24th, century, bc, unrolled, by, dr, h, ibscher, and, preserved, in, the, cairo, museum, a, roll, of, the, twelfth, dynasty, c, 1990, 1777, bc, now, in, berlin, the, mathematical, text, now, in, the, british, museum, ms, 10250, and, a, document, of, the, reign, of, ramses, ii, early, thirteenth, century, bc, civilizations, such, as, the, assyrians, and, the, babylonians, most, commonly, impressed, their, cuneiform, on, clay, tablets, but, they, also, wrote, on, parchment, from, the, 6th, century, bc, onward, by, the, fourth, century, ad, in, cultures, that, traditionally, used, papyrus, for, writing, parchment, began, to, become, the, new, standard, for, use, in, manufacturing, important, books, and, most, works, which, wished, to, be, preserved, were, eventually, moved, from, papyrus, to, parchment, in, the, later, middle, ages, especially, the, 15th, century, parchment, was, largely, replaced, by, paper, for, most, uses, except, luxury, manuscripts, some, of, which, were, also, on, paper, new, techniques, in, paper, milling, allowed, it, to, be, much, cheaper, than, parchment, it, was, made, of, textile, rags, and, of, very, high, quality, following, the, arrival, of, printing, in, the, later, fifteenth, century, ad, the, supply, of, animal, skins, for, parchment, could, not, keep, up, with, the, demands, of, printers, there, was, a, short, period, during, the, introduction, of, printing, where, parchment, and, paper, were, used, at, the, same, time, with, parchment, in, fact, vellum, the, more, expensive, luxury, option, preferred, by, rich, and, conservative, customers, although, most, copies, of, the, gutenberg, bible, are, on, paper, some, were, printed, on, parchment, 12, of, the, 48, surviving, copies, with, most, incomplete, in, 1490, johannes, trithemius, preferred, the, older, methods, because, handwriting, placed, on, parchment, will, be, able, to, endure, a, thousand, years, but, how, long, will, printing, last, which, is, dependent, on, paper, for, if, it, lasts, for, two, hundred, years, that, is, a, long, time, in, fact, high, quality, paper, from, this, period, has, survived, 500, years, or, more, very, well, if, kept, in, reasonable, library, conditions, parchment, or, vellum, continues, to, be, use, for, ritual, or, legal, reasons, rabbinic, literature, traditionally, maintains, that, the, institution, of, employing, parchment, made, of, animal, hides, for, the, writing, of, ritual, objects, as, detailed, below, in, the, united, kingdom, acts, of, parliament, are, still, printed, on, vellum, the, heyday, of, parchment, use, was, during, the, medieval, period, but, there, has, been, a, growing, revival, of, its, use, among, artists, since, the, late, 20th, century, although, parchment, never, stopped, being, used, primarily, for, governmental, documents, and, diplomas, it, had, ceased, to, be, a, primary, choice, for, artists, supports, by, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, renaissance, this, was, partly, due, to, its, expense, and, partly, due, to, its, unusual, working, properties, parchment, consists, mostly, of, collagen, when, the, water, in, paint, media, touches, the, parchment, s, surface, the, collagen, melts, slightly, forming, a, raised, bed, for, the, paint, a, quality, highly, prized, by, some, artists, parchment, is, also, extremely, affected, by, its, environment, and, changes, in, humidity, which, can, cause, buckling, books, with, parchment, pages, were, bound, with, strong, wooden, boards, and, clamped, tightly, shut, by, metal, often, brass, clasps, or, leather, straps, this, acted, to, keep, the, pages, pressed, flat, despite, humidity, changes, such, metal, fittings, continued, to, be, found, on, books, as, decorative, features, even, after, the, use, of, paper, made, them, unnecessary, some, contemporary, artists, prize, the, changeability, of, parchment, noting, that, the, material, seems, alive, and, like, an, active, participant, in, making, artwork, to, support, the, needs, of, the, revival, of, use, by, artists, a, revival, in, the, art, of, preparing, individual, skins, is, also, underway, hand, prepared, skins, are, usually, preferred, by, artists, because, they, are, more, uniform, in, surface, and, have, fewer, oily, spots, which, can, cause, long, term, cracking, of, paint, than, mass, produced, parchment, which, is, usually, made, for, lamp, shades, furniture, or, other, interior, design, purposes, parchment, is, prepared, from, pelt, i, e, wet, unhaired, and, limed, skin, by, drying, at, ordinary, temperatures, under, tension, most, commonly, on, a, wooden, frame, known, as, a, stretching, frame, after, a, carcass, is, skinned, the, hide, is, soaked, in, water, for, about, a, day, this, removes, blood, and, grime, and, prepares, the, skin, for, a, dehairing, liquor, the, dehairing, liquor, was, originally, made, of, rotted, or, fermented, vegetable, matter, like, beer, or, other, liquors, but, by, the, middle, ages, a, dehairing, bath, included, lime, today, the, lime, solution, is, occasionally, sharpened, by, the, use, of, sodium, sulfide, the, liquor, bath, would, have, been, in, wooden, or, stone, vats, and, the, hides, stirred, with, a, long, wooden, pole, to, avoid, human, contact, with, the, alkaline, solution, sometimes, the, skins, would, stay, in, the, dehairing, bath, for, eight, or, more, days, depending, how, concentrated, and, how, warm, the, solution, was, kept, dehairing, could, take, up, to, twice, as, long, in, winter, the, vat, was, stirred, two, or, three, times, a, day, to, ensure, the, solution, s, deep, and, uniform, penetration, replacing, the, lime, water, bath, also, sped, the, process, up, however, if, the, skins, were, soaked, in, the, liquor, too, long, they, would, be, weakened, and, not, able, to, stand, the, stretching, required, for, parchment, after, soaking, in, water, to, make, the, skins, workable, the, skins, were, placed, on, a, stretching, frame, a, simple, frame, with, nails, would, work, well, in, stretching, the, pelts, the, skins, could, be, attached, by, wrapping, small, smooth, rocks, in, the, skins, with, rope, or, leather, strips, both, sides, would, be, left, open, to, the, air, so, they, could, be, scraped, with, a, sharp, semi, lunar, knife, to, remove, the, last, of, the, hair, and, get, the, skin, to, the, right, thickness, the, skins, which, were, made, almost, entirely, of, collagen, would, form, a, natural, glue, while, drying, and, once, taken, off, the, frame, they, would, keep, their, form, the, stretching, aligned, the, fibres, to, be, more, nearly, parallel, to, the, surface, to, make, the, parchment, more, aesthetically, pleasing, or, more, suitable, for, the, scribes, special, treatments, were, used, according, to, reed, there, were, a, variety, of, these, treatments, rubbing, pumice, powder, into, the, flesh, side, of, parchment, while, it, was, still, wet, on, the, frame, was, used, to, make, it, smooth, and, to, modify, the, surface, to, enable, inks, to, penetrate, more, deeply, powders, and, pastes, of, calcium, compounds, were, also, used, to, help, remove, grease, so, the, ink, would, not, run, to, make, the, parchment, smooth, and, white, thin, pastes, starchgrain, or, staunchgrain, of, lime, flour, egg, whites, and, milk, were, rubbed, into, the, skins, meliora, di, curci, in, her, paper, the, history, and, technology, of, parchment, making, notes, that, parchment, was, not, always, white, cennini, a, 15th, century, craftsman, provides, recipes, to, tint, parchment, a, variety, of, colours, including, purple, indigo, green, red, and, peach, the, early, medieval, codex, argenteus, and, codex, vercellensis, the, stockholm, codex, aureus, and, the, codex, brixianus, give, a, range, of, luxuriously, produced, manuscripts, all, on, purple, vellum, in, imitation, of, byzantine, examples, like, the, rossano, gospels, sinope, gospels, and, the, vienna, genesis, which, at, least, at, one, time, are, believed, to, have, been, reserved, for, imperial, commissions, many, techniques, for, parchment, repair, exist, to, restore, creased, torn, or, incomplete, parchments, between, the, seventh, and, the, ninth, centuries, many, earlier, parchment, manuscripts, were, scrubbed, and, scoured, to, be, ready, for, rewriting, and, often, the, earlier, writing, can, still, be, read, these, recycled, parchments, are, known, as, palimpsests, later, more, thorough, techniques, of, scouring, the, surface, irretrievably, lost, the, earlier, text, the, way, in, which, parchment, was, processed, from, hide, to, parchment, has, undergone, a, tremendous, evolution, based, on, time, and, location, parchment, and, vellum, are, not, the, sole, methods, of, preparing, animal, skins, for, writing, in, the, babylonian, talmud, bava, batra, 14b, moses, is, described, as, having, written, the, first, torah, scroll, on, the, unsplit, cow, hide, called, gevil, parchment, is, still, the, only, medium, used, by, traditional, religious, jews, for, torah, scrolls, or, tefilin, and, mezuzahs, and, is, produced, by, large, companies, in, israel, this, usage, is, sinaitic, in, origin, with, special, designations, for, different, types, of, parchment, such, as, gevil, and, klaf, for, those, uses, only, hides, of, kosher, animals, are, permitted, since, there, are, many, requirements, for, it, being, fit, for, the, religious, use, the, liming, is, usually, processed, under, supervision, of, a, qualified, rabbi, in, some, universities, the, word, parchment, is, still, used, to, refer, to, the, certificate, scroll, presented, at, graduation, ceremonies, even, though, the, modern, document, is, printed, on, paper, or, thin, card, although, doctoral, graduates, may, be, given, the, option, of, having, their, scroll, written, by, a, calligrapher, on, vellum, heriot, watt, university, still, uses, goatskin, parchment, for, their, degrees, vegetable, paper, parchment, is, made, by, passing, a, waterleaf, an, unsized, paper, like, blotters, made, of, pulp, fibers, into, sulfuric, acid, the, sulfuric, acid, hydrolyses, and, solubilises, the, main, natural, organic, polymer, cellulose, present, in, the, pulp, wood, fibers, the, paper, web, is, then, washed, in, water, which, stops, the, hydrolysis, of, the, cellulose, and, causes, a, kind, of, cellulose, coating, to, form, on, the, waterleaf, the, final, paper, is, dried, this, coating, is, a, natural, non, porous, cement, that, gives, to, the, vegetable, parchment, paper, its, resistance, to, grease, and, its, semi, translucency, other, processes, can, be, used, to, obtain, grease, resistant, paper, such, as, waxing, the, paper, or, using, fluorine, based, chemicals, highly, beating, the, fibers, gives, an, even, more, translucent, paper, with, the, same, grease, resistance, silicone, and, other, coatings, may, also, be, applied, to, the, parchment, a, silicone, coating, treatment, produces, a, cross, linked, material, with, high, density, stability, and, heat, resistance, and, low, surface, tension, which, imparts, good, anti, stick, or, release, properties, chromium, salts, can, also, be, used, to, impart, moderate, anti, stick, properties, historians, believe, that, parchment, craft, originated, as, an, art, form, in, europe, during, the, fifteenth, or, sixteenth, centuries, parchment, craft, at, that, time, occurred, principally, in, catholic, communities, where, crafts, persons, created, lace, like, items, such, as, devotional, pictures, and, communion, cards, the, craft, developed, over, time, with, new, techniques, and, refinements, being, added, until, the, sixteenth, century, parchment, craft, was, a, european, art, form, however, missionaries, and, other, settlers, relocated, to, south, america, taking, parchment, craft, with, them, as, before, the, craft, appeared, largely, among, the, catholic, communities, often, young, girls, receiving, their, first, communion, received, gifts, of, handmade, parchment, crafts, although, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, led, to, a, reduced, interest, in, hand, made, cards, and, items, by, the, eighteenth, century, people, were, regaining, interest, in, detailed, handwork, parchment, cards, became, larger, in, size, and, crafters, began, adding, wavy, borders, and, perforations, in, the, nineteenth, century, influenced, by, french, romanticism, parchment, crafters, began, adding, floral, themes, and, cherubs, and, hand, embossing, parchment, craft, today, involves, various, techniques, including, tracing, a, pattern, with, white, or, colored, ink, embossing, to, create, a, raised, effect, stippling, perforating, coloring, and, cutting, parchment, craft, appears, in, hand, made, cards, as, scrapbook, embellishments, as, bookmarks, lampshades, decorative, small, boxes, wall, hangings, and, more, the, radiocarbon, dating, techniques, that, are, used, on, papyrus, can, be, applied, to, parchment, as, well, they, do, not, date, the, age, of, the, writing, but, the, preparation, of, the, parchment, itself, while, it, is, feasibly, possible, also, to, radiocarbon, date, certain, kinds, of, ink, it, is, extremely, difficult, to, do, due, to, the, fact, that, they, are, generally, present, on, the, text, only, in, trace, amounts, and, it, is, hard, to, get, a, carbon, sample, of, them, without, the, carbon, in, the, parchment, contaminating, it, an, article, published, in, 2009, considered, the, possibilities, of, tracing, the, origin, of, medieval, parchment, manuscripts, and, codices, through, dna, analysis, the, methodology, would, employ, polymerase, chain, reaction, to, replicate, a, small, dna, sample, to, a, size, sufficiently, large, for, testing, the, article, discusses, the, use, of, dna, testing, to, estimate, the, age, of, the, calf, at, the, creation, of, the, vellum, parchment, a, 2006, study, revealed, the, genetic, signature, of, several, greek, manuscripts, to, have, goat, related, sequences, utilizing, these, techniques, we, may, be, able, to, determine, whether, related, library, materials, were, made, from, genetically, related, animals, perhaps, from, the, same, herd, and, locate, the, vellum, s, origination, in, 2020, it, was, reported, that, the, species, of, several, of, the, animals, used, to, provide, parchment, for, the, dead, sea, scrolls, could, be, identified, and, the, relationship, between, skins, obtained, from, the, same, animal, inferred, the, breakthrough, was, made, possible, by, the, use, of, whole, genome, sequencing
