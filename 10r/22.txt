a, breed, is, a, specific, group, of, breedable, domestic, animals, having, homogeneous, appearance, phenotype, homogeneous, behavior, and, or, other, characteristics, that, distinguish, it, from, other, organisms, of, the, same, species, in, literature, there, exist, several, slightly, deviating, definitions, breeds, are, formed, through, genetic, isolation, and, either, natural, adaptation, to, the, environment, or, selective, breeding, or, a, combination, of, the, two, despite, the, centrality, of, the, idea, of, breeds, to, animal, husbandry, and, agriculture, no, single, scientifically, accepted, definition, of, the, term, exists, 340, a, breed, is, therefore, not, an, objective, or, biologically, verifiable, classification, but, is, instead, a, term, of, art, amongst, groups, of, breeders, who, share, a, consensus, around, what, qualities, make, some, members, of, a, given, species, members, of, a, nameable, subset, another, point, of, view, is, that, a, breed, is, consistent, enough, in, type, to, be, logically, grouped, together, and, when, mated, within, the, group, produce, the, same, type, when, bred, together, individuals, of, the, same, breed, pass, on, these, predictable, traits, to, their, offspring, and, this, ability, known, as, breeding, true, is, a, requirement, for, a, breed, plant, breeds, are, more, commonly, known, as, cultivars, the, offspring, produced, as, a, result, of, breeding, animals, of, one, breed, with, other, animals, of, another, breed, are, known, as, crossbreeds, or, mixed, breeds, crosses, between, animal, or, plant, variants, above, the, level, of, breed, cultivar, i, e, between, species, subspecies, botanical, variety, even, different, genera, are, referred, to, as, hybrids, the, breeder, or, group, of, breeders, who, initially, establishes, a, breed, does, so, by, selecting, individual, animals, from, within, a, gene, pool, that, they, see, as, having, the, necessary, qualities, needed, to, enhance, the, breed, model, they, are, aiming, for, these, animals, are, referred, to, as, foundation, stock, furthermore, the, breeder, mates, the, most, desirable, representatives, of, the, breed, from, his, or, her, point, of, view, aiming, to, pass, such, characteristics, to, their, progeny, this, process, is, known, as, selective, breeding, a, written, description, of, desirable, and, undesirable, breed, representatives, is, referred, to, as, a, breed, standard, breed, specific, characteristics, also, known, as, breed, traits, are, inherited, and, purebred, animals, pass, such, traits, from, generation, to, generation, thus, all, specimens, of, the, same, breed, carry, several, genetic, characteristics, of, the, original, foundation, animal, s, in, order, to, maintain, the, breed, a, breeder, would, select, those, animals, with, the, most, desirable, traits, to, achieve, further, maintenance, and, developing, of, such, traits, at, the, same, time, the, breed, would, avoid, animals, carrying, characteristics, undesirable, or, not, typical, for, the, breed, including, faults, or, genetic, defects, the, population, within, the, same, breed, should, consist, of, a, sufficient, number, of, animals, to, maintain, the, breed, within, the, specified, parameters, without, the, necessity, of, forced, inbreeding, domestic, animal, breeds, commonly, differ, from, country, to, country, and, from, nation, to, nation, breeds, originating, in, a, certain, country, are, known, as, native, breeds, of, that, country
