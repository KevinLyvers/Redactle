a, sail, is, a, tensile, structure, which, is, made, from, fabric, or, other, membrane, materials, that, uses, wind, power, to, propel, sailing, craft, including, sailing, ships, sailboats, windsurfers, ice, boats, and, even, sail, powered, land, vehicles, sails, may, be, made, from, a, combination, of, woven, materials, including, canvas, or, polyester, cloth, laminated, membranes, or, bonded, filaments, usually, in, a, three, or, four, sided, shape, a, sail, provides, propulsive, force, via, a, combination, of, lift, and, drag, depending, on, its, angle, of, attack, its, angle, with, respect, to, the, apparent, wind, apparent, wind, is, the, air, velocity, experienced, on, the, moving, craft, and, is, the, combined, effect, of, the, true, wind, velocity, with, the, velocity, of, the, sailing, craft, angle, of, attack, is, often, constrained, by, the, sailing, craft, s, orientation, to, the, wind, or, point, of, sail, on, points, of, sail, where, it, is, possible, to, align, the, leading, edge, of, the, sail, with, the, apparent, wind, the, sail, may, act, as, an, airfoil, generating, propulsive, force, as, air, passes, along, its, surface, just, as, an, airplane, wing, generates, lift, which, predominates, over, aerodynamic, drag, retarding, forward, motion, the, more, that, the, angle, of, attack, diverges, from, the, apparent, wind, as, a, sailing, craft, turns, downwind, the, more, drag, increases, and, lift, decreases, as, propulsive, forces, until, a, sail, going, downwind, is, predominated, by, drag, forces, sails, are, unable, to, generate, propulsive, force, if, they, are, aligned, too, closely, to, the, wind, sails, may, be, attached, to, a, mast, boom, or, other, spar, or, may, be, attached, to, a, wire, that, is, suspended, by, a, mast, they, are, typically, raised, by, a, line, called, a, halyard, and, their, angle, with, respect, to, the, wind, is, usually, controlled, by, a, line, called, a, sheet, in, use, they, may, be, designed, to, be, curved, in, both, directions, along, their, surface, often, as, a, result, of, their, curved, edges, battens, may, be, used, to, extend, the, trailing, edge, of, a, sail, beyond, the, line, of, its, attachment, points, other, non, rotating, airfoils, that, power, sailing, craft, include, wingsails, which, are, rigid, wing, like, structures, and, kites, that, power, kite, rigged, vessels, but, do, not, employ, a, mast, to, support, the, airfoil, and, are, beyond, the, scope, of, this, article, sailing, craft, employ, two, types, of, rig, the, square, rig, and, the, fore, and, aft, rig, the, square, rig, carries, the, primary, driving, sails, on, horizontal, spars, which, are, perpendicular, or, square, to, the, keel, of, the, vessel, and, to, the, masts, these, spars, are, called, yards, and, their, tips, beyond, the, lifts, are, called, the, yardarms, a, ship, mainly, so, rigged, is, called, a, square, rigger, a, fore, and, aft, rig, consists, of, sails, that, are, set, along, the, line, of, the, keel, rather, than, perpendicular, to, it, vessels, so, rigged, are, described, as, fore, and, aft, rigged, the, invention, of, the, sail, was, a, technological, advance, of, equal, or, even, greater, importance, than, the, invention, of, the, wheel, it, has, been, suggested, by, some, that, it, has, the, significance, of, the, development, of, the, neolithic, lifestyle, or, the, first, establishment, of, cities, yet, it, is, not, known, when, or, where, this, invention, took, place, 173, much, of, the, early, development, of, water, transport, is, believed, to, have, occurred, in, two, main, nursery, areas, of, the, world, island, southeast, asia, and, the, mediterranean, region, in, both, of, these, you, have, warmer, waters, so, that, use, of, rafts, is, possible, without, the, risk, of, hypothermia, a, raft, is, usually, a, flow, through, structure, and, a, number, of, intervisible, islands, create, both, an, invitation, to, travel, and, an, environment, where, advanced, navigation, techniques, are, not, needed, alongside, this, the, nile, has, a, northward, flowing, current, with, a, prevailing, wind, in, the, opposite, direction, so, giving, the, potential, to, drift, in, one, direction, and, sail, in, the, other, 113, 7, many, do, not, consider, sails, to, have, been, used, before, the, 5th, millennium, bce, others, consider, sails, to, have, been, invented, much, earlier, 174, 175, archaeological, studies, of, the, cucuteni, trypillian, culture, ceramics, show, use, of, sailing, boats, from, the, sixth, millennium, bce, onwards, excavations, of, the, ubaid, period, c, 6000, 4300, bce, in, mesopotamia, provide, direct, evidence, of, sailing, boats, sails, from, ancient, egypt, are, depicted, around, 3200, bce, where, reed, boats, sailed, upstream, against, the, river, nile, s, current, ancient, sumerians, used, square, rigged, sailing, boats, at, about, the, same, time, and, it, is, believed, they, established, sea, trading, routes, as, far, away, as, the, indus, valley, greeks, and, phoenicians, began, trading, by, ship, by, around, 1200, bce, v, shaped, square, rigs, with, two, spars, that, come, together, at, the, hull, were, the, ancestral, sailing, rig, of, the, austronesian, peoples, before, they, developed, the, fore, and, aft, crab, claw, tanja, and, junk, rigs, the, date, of, introduction, of, these, later, austronesian, sails, is, disputed, lateen, sails, emerged, by, around, the, 2nd, century, ce, in, the, mediterranean, they, did, not, become, common, until, the, 5th, century, when, there, is, evidence, that, the, mediterranean, square, sail, which, had, been, in, wide, use, throughout, the, classical, period, was, undergoing, a, simplification, of, its, rigging, components, both, the, increasing, popularity, of, the, lateen, and, the, changes, to, the, contemporary, square, rig, are, suggested, to, be, cost, saving, measures, reducing, the, number, of, expensive, components, needed, to, fit, out, a, ship, it, has, been, a, common, and, erroneous, presumption, among, maritime, historians, that, lateen, had, significantly, better, sailing, performance, than, the, square, rig, of, the, same, period, analysis, of, voyages, described, in, contemporary, accounts, and, also, in, various, replica, vessels, demonstrates, that, the, performance, of, square, rig, and, lateen, were, very, similar, lateen, provided, a, cheaper, rig, to, build, and, maintain, with, no, degradation, of, performance, the, lateen, was, adopted, by, arab, seafarers, usually, in, the, sub, type, the, settee, sail, but, the, date, is, uncertain, with, no, firm, evidence, for, their, use, in, the, western, indian, ocean, before, 1500, ce, there, is, however, good, iconographic, evidence, of, square, sails, being, used, by, arab, persian, and, indian, ships, in, this, region, in, for, instance, 1519, the, popularity, of, the, caravel, in, northern, european, waters, from, about, 1440, made, lateen, sails, familiar, in, this, part, of, the, world, additionally, lateen, sails, were, used, for, the, mizzen, on, early, three, masted, ships, playing, a, significant, role, in, the, development, of, the, full, rigged, ship, it, did, not, however, provide, much, of, the, propulsive, force, of, these, vessels, rather, serving, as, a, balancing, sail, that, was, needed, for, some, manoeuvres, in, some, sea, and, wind, conditions, the, extensive, amount, of, contemporary, maritime, art, showing, the, lateen, mizzen, on, 16th, and, 17th, century, ships, often, has, the, sail, furled, practical, experience, on, the, duyfken, replica, confirmed, the, role, of, the, lateen, mizzen, austronesian, invention, of, catamarans, outriggers, and, the, bi, sparred, triangular, crab, claw, sails, enabled, their, ships, to, sail, for, vast, distances, in, open, ocean, it, led, to, the, austronesian, expansion, from, taiwan, they, rapidly, settled, the, islands, of, maritime, southeast, asia, then, later, sailed, further, onwards, to, micronesia, island, melanesia, polynesia, and, madagascar, eventually, settling, a, territory, spanning, half, the, globe, the, proto, austronesian, words, for, sail, lay, r, and, some, other, rigging, parts, date, to, about, 3000, bce, when, this, group, began, their, pacific, expansion, austronesian, rigs, are, distinctive, in, that, they, have, spars, supporting, both, the, upper, and, lower, edges, of, the, sails, and, sometimes, in, between, the, sails, were, also, made, from, salt, resistant, woven, leaves, usually, from, pandan, plants, crab, claw, sails, used, with, single, outrigger, ships, in, micronesia, island, melanesia, polynesia, and, madagascar, were, intrinsically, unstable, when, tacking, leeward, to, deal, with, this, austronesians, in, these, regions, developed, the, shunting, technique, in, sailing, in, conjunction, with, uniquely, reversible, single, outriggers, in, the, rest, of, austronesia, crab, claw, sails, were, mainly, for, double, outrigger, trimarans, and, double, hulled, catamarans, boats, which, remained, stable, even, leeward, in, western, island, southeast, asia, later, square, sails, also, evolved, from, the, crab, claw, sail, the, tanja, and, the, junk, rig, both, of, which, retained, the, austronesian, characteristic, of, having, more, than, one, spar, supporting, the, sail, aerodynamic, forces, on, sails, depend, on, wind, speed, and, direction, and, the, speed, and, direction, of, the, craft, the, direction, that, the, craft, is, traveling, with, respect, to, the, true, wind, the, wind, direction, and, speed, over, the, surface, is, called, the, point, of, sail, the, speed, of, the, craft, at, a, given, point, of, sail, contributes, to, the, apparent, wind, v, a, the, wind, speed, and, direction, as, measured, on, the, moving, craft, the, apparent, wind, on, the, sail, creates, a, total, aerodynamic, force, which, may, be, resolved, into, drag, the, force, component, in, the, direction, of, the, apparent, wind, and, lift, the, force, component, normal, 90, to, the, apparent, wind, depending, on, the, alignment, of, the, sail, with, the, apparent, wind, lift, or, drag, may, be, the, predominant, propulsive, component, total, aerodynamic, force, also, resolves, into, a, forward, propulsive, driving, force, resisted, by, the, medium, through, or, over, which, the, craft, is, passing, e, g, through, water, air, or, over, ice, sand, and, a, lateral, force, resisted, by, the, underwater, foils, ice, runners, or, wheels, of, the, sailing, craft, for, apparent, wind, angles, aligned, with, the, entry, point, of, the, sail, the, sail, acts, as, an, airfoil, and, lift, is, the, predominant, component, of, propulsion, for, apparent, wind, angles, behind, the, sail, lift, diminishes, and, drag, increases, as, the, predominant, component, of, propulsion, for, a, given, true, wind, velocity, over, the, surface, a, sail, can, propel, a, craft, to, a, higher, speed, on, points, of, sail, when, the, entry, point, of, the, sail, is, aligned, with, the, apparent, wind, than, it, can, with, the, entry, point, not, aligned, because, of, a, combination, of, the, diminished, force, from, airflow, around, the, sail, and, the, diminished, apparent, wind, from, the, velocity, of, the, craft, because, of, limitations, on, speed, through, the, water, displacement, sailboats, generally, derive, power, from, sails, generating, lift, on, points, of, sail, that, include, close, hauled, through, broad, reach, approximately, 40, to, 135, off, the, wind, because, of, low, friction, over, the, surface, and, high, speeds, over, the, ice, that, create, high, apparent, wind, speeds, for, most, points, of, sail, iceboats, can, derive, power, from, lift, further, off, the, wind, than, displacement, boats, each, rig, is, configured, in, a, sail, plan, appropriate, to, the, size, of, the, sailing, craft, a, sail, plan, is, a, set, of, drawings, usually, prepared, by, a, naval, architect, which, shows, the, various, combinations, of, sail, proposed, for, a, sailing, ship, sail, plans, may, vary, for, different, wind, conditions, light, to, heavy, both, square, rigged, and, fore, and, aft, rigged, vessels, have, been, built, with, a, wide, range, of, configurations, for, single, and, multiple, masts, with, sails, and, with, a, variety, of, means, of, primary, attachment, to, the, craft, including, high, performance, yachts, including, the, international, c, class, catamaran, have, used, or, use, rigid, wing, sails, which, perform, better, than, traditional, soft, sails, but, are, more, difficult, to, manage, a, rigid, wing, sail, was, used, by, stars, and, stripes, the, defender, which, won, the, 1988, america, s, cup, and, by, usa, 17, the, challenger, which, won, the, 2010, america, s, cup, usa, 17, s, performance, during, the, 2010, america, s, cup, races, demonstrated, a, velocity, made, good, upwind, of, over, twice, the, wind, speed, and, downwind, of, over, 2, 5, times, the, wind, speed, and, the, ability, to, sail, as, close, as, 20, degrees, off, the, apparent, wind, the, shape, of, a, sail, is, defined, by, its, edges, and, corners, in, the, plane, of, the, sail, laid, out, on, a, flat, surface, the, edges, may, be, curved, either, to, extend, the, sail, s, shape, as, an, airfoil, or, to, define, its, shape, in, use, in, use, the, sail, becomes, a, curved, shape, adding, the, dimension, of, depth, or, draft, sail, characteristics, derive, in, part, from, the, design, construction, and, the, attributes, of, the, fibers, which, are, woven, together, to, make, the, sail, cloth, there, are, several, key, factors, in, evaluating, a, fiber, for, suitability, in, weaving, a, sail, cloth, initial, modulus, breaking, strength, tenacity, creep, and, flex, strength, both, the, initial, cost, and, its, durability, of, the, material, define, its, cost, effectiveness, over, time, traditionally, sails, were, made, from, flax, or, cotton, canvas, although, scandinavian, scottish, and, icelandic, cultures, used, woolen, sails, from, the, 11th, into, the, 19th, centuries, materials, used, in, sails, as, of, the, 21st, century, include, nylon, for, spinnakers, where, light, weight, and, elastic, resistance, to, shock, load, are, valued, and, a, range, of, fibers, used, for, triangular, sails, that, includes, dacron, aramid, fibers, including, kevlar, and, other, liquid, crystal, polymer, fibers, including, vectran, woven, materials, like, dacron, may, specified, as, either, high, or, low, tenacity, as, indicated, in, part, by, their, denier, count, a, unit, of, measure, for, the, linear, mass, density, of, fibers, cross, cut, sails, have, the, panels, sewn, parallel, to, one, another, often, parallel, to, the, foot, of, the, sail, and, are, the, least, expensive, of, the, two, sail, constructions, triangular, cross, cut, sail, panels, are, designed, to, meet, the, mast, and, stay, at, an, angle, from, either, the, warp, or, the, weft, on, the, bias, to, allow, stretching, along, the, luff, but, minimize, stretching, on, the, luff, and, foot, where, the, fibers, are, aligned, with, the, edges, of, the, sail, radial, sails, have, panels, that, radiate, from, corners, in, order, to, efficiently, transmit, stress, and, are, typically, of, higher, performance, than, cross, cut, sails, a, bi, radial, sail, has, panels, radiating, from, two, of, three, corners, a, tri, radial, sail, has, panels, radiating, from, all, three, corners, mainsails, are, more, likely, to, be, bi, radial, since, there, is, very, little, stress, at, the, tack, whereas, head, sails, spinnakers, and, jibs, are, more, likely, to, be, tri, radial, because, they, are, tensioned, at, their, corners, higher, performance, sails, may, be, laminated, constructed, directly, from, multiple, plies, of, filaments, fibers, taffetas, and, films, instead, of, woven, textiles, that, are, adhered, together, molded, sails, are, laminated, sails, formed, over, a, curved, mold, and, adhered, together, into, a, shape, that, does, not, lie, flat, conventional, sail, panels, are, sewn, together, sails, are, tensile, structures, so, the, role, of, a, seam, is, to, transmit, a, tensile, load, from, panel, to, panel, for, a, sewn, textile, sail, this, is, done, through, thread, and, is, limited, by, the, strength, of, the, thread, and, the, strength, of, the, hole, in, the, textile, through, which, it, passes, sail, seams, are, often, overlapped, between, panels, and, sewn, with, zig, zag, stitches, that, create, many, connections, per, unit, of, seam, length, whereas, textiles, are, typically, sewn, together, other, sail, materials, may, be, ultrasonically, welded, a, technique, whereby, high, frequency, ultrasonic, acoustic, vibrations, are, locally, applied, to, workpieces, being, held, together, under, pressure, to, create, a, solid, state, weld, it, is, commonly, used, for, plastics, and, especially, for, joining, dissimilar, materials, sails, feature, reinforcements, of, fabric, layers, where, lines, attach, at, grommets, or, cringles, a, bolt, rope, may, be, sewn, onto, the, edges, of, a, sail, to, reinforce, it, or, to, fix, the, sail, into, a, groove, in, the, boom, in, the, mast, or, in, the, luff, foil, of, a, roller, furling, jib, they, may, have, stiffening, features, called, battens, that, help, shape, the, sail, when, full, length, or, just, the, roach, when, present, they, may, have, a, variety, of, means, of, reefing, them, reducing, sail, area, including, rows, of, short, lines, affixed, to, the, sail, to, wrap, up, unused, sail, as, on, square, and, gaff, rigs, or, simply, grommets, through, which, a, line, or, a, hook, may, pass, as, on, bermuda, mainsails, fore, and, aft, sails, may, have, tell, tales, pieces, of, yarn, thread, or, tape, that, are, affixed, to, sails, to, help, visualize, airflow, over, their, surfaces, the, lines, that, attach, to, and, control, sails, are, part, of, the, running, rigging, and, differ, between, square, and, fore, and, aft, rigs, some, rigs, shift, from, one, side, of, the, mast, to, the, other, e, g, the, dipping, lug, sail, and, the, lateen, the, lines, can, be, categorized, as, those, that, support, the, sail, those, that, shape, it, and, those, that, control, its, angle, to, the, wind, fore, and, aft, rigged, vessels, have, rigging, that, supports, shapes, and, adjusts, the, sails, to, optimize, their, performance, in, the, wind, which, include, the, following, lines, square, rigged, vessels, require, more, controlling, lines, than, fore, and, aft, rigged, ones, including, the, following, sails, on, high, performance, sailing, craft, sails, on, craft, subject, to, low, forward, resistance, and, high, lateral, resistance, typically, have, full, length, battens
