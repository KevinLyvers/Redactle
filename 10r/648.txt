a, dye, is, a, colored, substance, that, chemically, bonds, to, the, substrate, to, which, it, is, being, applied, this, distinguishes, dyes, from, pigments, which, do, not, chemically, bind, to, the, material, they, color, dye, is, generally, applied, in, an, aqueous, solution, and, may, require, a, mordant, to, improve, the, fastness, of, the, dye, on, the, fiber, the, majority, of, natural, dyes, are, derived, from, non, animal, sources, such, as, roots, berries, bark, leaves, wood, fungi, and, lichens, however, due, to, large, scale, demand, and, technological, improvements, most, dyes, used, in, the, modern, world, are, synthetically, produced, from, substances, such, as, petrochemicals, some, are, extracted, from, insects, and, or, minerals, synthetic, dyes, are, produced, from, various, chemicals, the, great, majority, of, dyes, are, obtained, in, this, way, because, of, their, superior, cost, optical, properties, color, and, resilience, fastness, mordancy, both, dyes, and, pigments, are, colored, because, they, absorb, only, some, wavelengths, of, visible, light, dyes, are, usually, soluble, in, some, solvent, whereas, pigments, are, insoluble, some, dyes, can, be, rendered, insoluble, with, the, addition, of, salt, to, produce, a, lake, pigment, textile, dyeing, dates, back, to, the, neolithic, period, throughout, history, people, have, dyed, their, textiles, using, common, locally, available, materials, scarce, dyestuffs, that, produced, brilliant, and, permanent, colors, such, as, the, natural, invertebrate, dyes, tyrian, purple, and, crimson, kermes, were, highly, prized, luxury, items, in, the, ancient, and, medieval, world, plant, based, dyes, such, as, woad, indigo, saffron, and, madder, were, important, trade, goods, in, the, economies, of, asia, and, europe, across, asia, and, africa, patterned, fabrics, were, produced, using, resist, dyeing, techniques, to, control, the, absorption, of, color, in, piece, dyed, cloth, dyes, from, the, new, world, such, as, cochineal, and, logwood, were, brought, to, europe, by, the, spanish, treasure, fleets, and, the, dyestuffs, of, europe, were, carried, by, colonists, to, america, dyed, flax, fibers, have, been, found, in, the, republic, of, georgia, in, a, prehistoric, cave, dated, to, 36, 000, bp, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, particularly, in, india, and, phoenicia, dyeing, has, been, widely, carried, out, for, over, 5, 000, years, early, dyes, were, obtained, from, animal, vegetable, or, mineral, sources, with, no, to, very, little, processing, by, far, the, greatest, source, of, dyes, has, been, from, the, plant, kingdom, notably, roots, berries, bark, leaves, and, wood, only, few, of, which, are, used, on, a, commercial, scale, early, industrialization, was, conducted, by, j, pullar, and, sons, in, scotland, the, first, synthetic, dye, mauve, was, discovered, serendipitously, by, william, henry, perkin, in, 1856, the, discovery, of, mauveine, started, a, surge, in, synthetic, dyes, and, in, organic, chemistry, in, general, other, aniline, dyes, followed, such, as, fuchsine, safranine, and, induline, many, thousands, of, synthetic, dyes, have, since, been, prepared, the, discovery, of, mauve, also, led, to, developments, within, immunology, and, chemotherapy, in, 1863, the, forerunner, to, bayer, ag, was, formed, in, what, became, wuppertal, germany, in, 1891, paul, ehrlich, discovered, that, certain, cells, or, organisms, took, up, certain, dyes, selectively, he, then, reasoned, that, a, sufficiently, large, dose, could, be, injected, to, kill, pathogenic, microorganisms, if, the, dye, did, not, affect, other, cells, ehrlich, went, on, to, use, a, compound, to, target, syphilis, the, first, time, a, chemical, was, used, in, order, to, selectively, kill, bacteria, in, the, body, he, also, used, methylene, blue, to, target, the, plasmodium, responsible, for, malaria, the, color, of, a, dye, is, dependent, upon, the, ability, of, the, substance, to, absorb, light, within, the, visible, region, of, the, electromagnetic, spectrum, 380, 750, nm, an, earlier, theory, known, as, witt, theory, stated, that, a, colored, dye, had, two, components, a, chromophore, which, imparts, color, by, absorbing, light, in, the, visible, region, some, examples, are, nitro, azo, quinoid, groups, and, an, auxochrome, which, serves, to, deepen, the, color, this, theory, has, been, superseded, by, modern, electronic, structure, theory, which, states, that, the, color, in, dyes, is, due, to, excitation, of, valence, electrons, by, visible, light, dyes, are, classified, according, to, their, solubility, and, chemical, properties, acid, dyes, are, water, soluble, anionic, dyes, that, are, applied, to, fibers, such, as, silk, wool, nylon, and, modified, acrylic, fibers, using, neutral, to, acid, dye, baths, attachment, to, the, fiber, is, attributed, at, least, partly, to, salt, formation, between, anionic, groups, in, the, dyes, and, cationic, groups, in, the, fiber, acid, dyes, are, not, substantive, to, cellulosic, fibers, most, synthetic, food, colors, fall, in, this, category, examples, of, acid, dye, are, alizarine, pure, blue, b, acid, red, 88, etc, basic, dyes, are, water, soluble, cationic, dyes, that, are, mainly, applied, to, acrylic, fibers, but, find, some, use, for, wool, and, silk, usually, acetic, acid, is, added, to, the, dye, bath, to, help, the, uptake, of, the, dye, onto, the, fiber, basic, dyes, are, also, used, in, the, coloration, of, paper, direct, or, substantive, dyeing, is, normally, carried, out, in, a, neutral, or, slightly, alkaline, dye, bath, at, or, near, boiling, point, with, the, addition, of, either, sodium, chloride, nacl, or, sodium, sulfate, na, 2, so, 4, or, sodium, carbonate, na, 2, co, 3, direct, dyes, are, used, on, cotton, paper, leather, wool, silk, and, nylon, they, are, also, used, as, ph, indicators, and, as, biological, stains, laser, dyes, are, used, in, the, production, of, some, lasers, optical, media, cd, r, and, camera, sensors, color, filter, array, mordant, dyes, require, a, mordant, which, improves, the, fastness, of, the, dye, against, water, light, and, perspiration, the, choice, of, mordant, is, very, important, as, different, mordants, can, change, the, final, color, significantly, most, natural, dyes, are, mordant, dyes, and, there, is, therefore, a, large, literature, base, describing, dyeing, techniques, the, most, important, mordant, dyes, are, the, synthetic, mordant, dyes, or, chrome, dyes, used, for, wool, these, comprise, some, 30, of, dyes, used, for, wool, and, are, especially, useful, for, black, and, navy, shades, the, mordant, potassium, dichromate, is, applied, as, an, after, treatment, it, is, important, to, note, that, many, mordants, particularly, those, in, the, heavy, metal, category, can, be, hazardous, to, health, and, extreme, care, must, be, taken, in, using, them, vat, dyes, are, essentially, insoluble, in, water, and, incapable, of, dyeing, fibres, directly, however, reduction, in, alkaline, liquor, produces, the, water, soluble, alkali, metal, salt, of, the, dye, this, form, is, often, colorless, in, which, case, it, is, referred, to, as, a, leuco, dye, and, has, an, affinity, for, the, textile, fibre, subsequent, oxidation, reforms, the, original, insoluble, dye, the, color, of, denim, is, due, to, indigo, the, original, vat, dye, reactive, dyes, utilize, a, chromophore, attached, to, a, substituent, that, is, capable, of, directly, reacting, with, the, fiber, substrate, the, covalent, bonds, that, attach, reactive, dye, to, natural, fibers, make, them, among, the, most, permanent, of, dyes, cold, reactive, dyes, such, as, procion, mx, cibacron, f, and, drimarene, k, are, very, easy, to, use, because, the, dye, can, be, applied, at, room, temperature, reactive, dyes, are, by, far, the, best, choice, for, dyeing, cotton, and, other, cellulose, fibers, at, home, or, in, the, art, studio, disperse, dyes, were, originally, developed, for, the, dyeing, of, cellulose, acetate, and, are, water, insoluble, the, dyes, are, finely, ground, in, the, presence, of, a, dispersing, agent, and, sold, as, a, paste, or, spray, dried, and, sold, as, a, powder, their, main, use, is, to, dye, polyester, but, they, can, also, be, used, to, dye, nylon, cellulose, triacetate, and, acrylic, fibers, in, some, cases, a, dyeing, temperature, of, 130, c, 266, f, is, required, and, a, pressurized, dyebath, is, used, the, very, fine, particle, size, gives, a, large, surface, area, that, aids, dissolution, to, allow, uptake, by, the, fiber, the, dyeing, rate, can, be, significantly, influenced, by, the, choice, of, dispersing, agent, used, during, the, grinding, azoic, dyeing, is, a, technique, in, which, an, insoluble, azo, dye, is, produced, directly, onto, or, within, the, fiber, this, is, achieved, by, treating, a, fiber, with, both, diazoic, and, coupling, components, with, suitable, adjustment, of, dyebath, conditions, the, two, components, react, to, produce, the, required, insoluble, azo, dye, this, technique, of, dyeing, is, unique, in, that, the, final, color, is, controlled, by, the, choice, of, the, diazoic, and, coupling, components, this, method, of, dyeing, cotton, is, declining, in, importance, due, to, the, toxic, nature, of, the, chemicals, used, sulfur, dyes, are, inexpensive, dyes, used, to, dye, cotton, with, dark, colors, dyeing, is, effected, by, heating, the, fabric, in, a, solution, of, an, organic, compound, typically, a, nitrophenol, derivative, and, sulfide, or, polysulfide, the, organic, compound, reacts, with, the, sulfide, source, to, form, dark, colors, that, adhere, to, the, fabric, sulfur, black, 1, the, largest, selling, dye, by, volume, does, not, have, a, well, defined, chemical, structure, some, dyes, commonly, used, in, staining, one, other, class, that, describes, the, role, of, dyes, rather, than, their, mode, of, use, is, the, food, dye, because, food, dyes, are, classed, as, food, additives, they, are, manufactured, to, a, higher, standard, than, some, industrial, dyes, food, dyes, can, be, direct, mordant, and, vat, dyes, and, their, use, is, strictly, controlled, by, legislation, many, are, azo, dyes, although, anthraquinone, and, triphenylmethane, compounds, are, used, for, colors, such, as, green, and, blue, some, naturally, occurring, dyes, are, also, used, a, number, of, other, classes, have, also, been, established, including, by, the, nature, of, their, chromophore, dyes, are, divided, into, dyes, produced, by, the, textile, printing, and, paper, industries, are, a, source, of, pollution, of, rivers, and, waterways, an, estimated, 700, 000, tons, of, dyestuffs, are, produced, annually, 1990, data, the, disposal, of, that, material, has, received, much, attention, using, chemical, and, biological, means, a, vital, dye, or, stain, is, a, dye, capable, of, penetrating, living, cells, or, tissues, without, causing, immediate, visible, degenerative, changes, such, dyes, are, useful, in, medical, and, pathological, fields, in, order, to, selectively, color, certain, structures, such, as, cells, in, order, to, distinguish, them, from, surrounding, tissue, and, thus, make, them, more, visible, for, study, for, instance, under, a, microscope, as, the, visibility, is, meant, to, allow, study, of, the, cells, or, tissues, it, is, usually, important, that, the, dye, not, have, other, effects, on, the, structure, or, function, of, the, tissue, that, might, impair, objective, observation, a, distinction, is, drawn, between, dyes, that, are, meant, to, be, used, on, cells, that, have, been, removed, from, the, organism, prior, to, study, supravital, staining, and, dyes, that, are, used, within, a, living, body, administered, by, injection, or, other, means, intravital, staining, as, the, latter, is, for, instance, subject, to, higher, safety, standards, and, must, typically, be, a, chemical, known, to, avoid, causing, adverse, effects, on, any, biochemistry, until, cleared, from, the, tissue, not, just, to, the, tissue, being, studied, or, in, the, short, term, the, term, vital, stain, is, occasionally, used, interchangeably, with, both, intravital, and, supravital, stains, the, underlying, concept, in, either, case, being, that, the, cells, examined, are, still, alive, in, a, stricter, sense, the, term, vital, staining, means, the, polar, opposite, of, supravital, staining, if, living, cells, absorb, the, stain, during, supravital, staining, they, exclude, it, during, vital, staining, for, example, they, color, negatively, while, only, dead, cells, color, positively, and, thus, viability, can, be, determined, by, counting, the, percentage, of, total, cells, that, stain, negatively, because, the, dye, determines, whether, the, staining, is, supravital, or, intravital, a, combination, of, supravital, and, vital, dyes, can, be, used, to, more, accurately, classify, cells, into, various, groups, e, g, viable, dead, dying
