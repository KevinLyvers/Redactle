the, afghan, pesh, kabz, or, in, some, instances, no, cutting, edge, at, all, such, as, the, stiletto, of, the, renaissance, however, in, the, last, hundred, years, or, so, in, most, contexts, a,

weapons, so, knife, legislation, in, many, places, restricts, their, manufacture, sale, possession, transport, or, use, the, earliest, daggers, were, made, of, materials, such, as, flint, ivory, or, bone, in, neolithic, times, copper, daggers, appeared, first, in, the, early, bronze, age, in, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, and, copper, daggers, of, early, minoan, iii, 2400, 2000, bc, were, recovered,

production, did, not, begin, until, 1200, bc, and, iron, ore, was, not, found, in, egypt, making, the, iron, dagger, rare, and, the, context, suggests, that, the, iron, dagger, was, valued, on, a, level, equal, to, that, of, its, ceremonial, gold, counterpart, these, facts, and, the, composition, of, the, dagger, had, long, suggested, a, meteoritic, origin, however, evidence, for, its, meteoritic, origin, was, not, entirely, conclusive, until, june, 2016, when, researchers, using, x, ray, fluorescence, spectrometry, confirmed, similar, proportions, of, metals, iron, 10, nickel, and, 0, 6, cobalt, in, a, meteorite, discovered, in, the, area, deposited, by, an, ancient, meteor, shower, one, of, the, earliest, objects, made, of, smelted, iron, is, a, dagger, dating, to, before, 2000, bc, found, in, a, context, that, suggests, it, was, treated, as, an, ornamental, object, of, great, value, found, in, a, hattic, royal, tomb, dated, about, 2500, bc, at, alaca, h, y, k, in, northern, anatolia, the, dagger, has, a, smelted, iron, blade, and, a, gold, handle, the, artisans, and, blacksmiths, of, iberia, in, what, is, now, southern, spain, and, southwestern, france, produced, various, iron, daggers, and, swords, of, high, quality, from, the, 5th, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, in, ornamentation, and, patterns, influenced, by, greek, punic, carthaginian, and, phoenician, culture, the, exceptional, purity, of, iberian, iron, and, the, sophisticated, method, of, forging, which, included, cold, hammering, produced, double, edged, weapons, of, excellent, quality, one, can, find, technologically, advanced, designs, such, as, folding, knives, rusted, among, the, artifacts, of, many, second, iberian, iron, age, cremation, burials, or, in, roman, empire, excavations, all, around, spain, and, the, mediterranean, iberian, infantrymen, carried, several, types, of, iron, daggers, most, of, them, based, on, shortened, versions, of, double, edged, swords, but, the, true, iberian, dagger, had, a, triangular, shaped, blade, iberian, daggers, and, swords, were, later, adopted, by, hannibal, and, his, carthaginian, armies, the, lusitanii, a, pre, celtic, people, dominating, the, lands, west, of, iberia, most, of, modern, portugal, and, extremadura, successfully, held, off, the, roman, empire, for, many, years, with, a, variety, of, innovative, tactics, and, light, weapons, including, iron, bladed, short, spears, and, daggers, modeled, after, iberian, patterns, during, the, roman, empire, legionaries, were, issued, a, pugio, from, the, latin, pugn, or, fight, a, double, edged, iron, thrusting, dagger, with, a, blade, of, 7, 12, in, 18, 30, cm, the, design, and, fabrication, of, the, pugio, was, taken, directly, from, iberian, daggers, and, short, swords, the, romans, even, adopted, the, triangular, bladed, iberian, dagger, which, they, called, the, parazonium, like, the, gladius, the, pugio, was, most, often, used, as, a, thrusting, stabbing, weapon, as, an, extreme, close, quarter, combat, weapon, the, pugio, was, the, roman, soldier, s, last, line, of, defense, when, not, in, battle, the, pugio, served, as, a, convenient, utility, knife, the, term, dagger, appears, only, in, the, late, middle, ages, reflecting, the, fact, that, while, the, dagger, had, been, known, in, antiquity, it, had, disappeared, during, the, early, middle, ages, replaced, by, the, hewing, knife, or, seax, the, dagger, reappeared, in, the, 12th, century, as, the, knightly, dagger, or, more, properly, cross, hilt, or, quillon, dagger, and, was, developed, into, a, common, arm, and, tool, for, civilian, use, by, the, late, medieval, period, the, earliest, known, depiction, of, a, cross, hilt, dagger, is, the, so, called, guido, relief, inside, the, grossm, nster, of, z, rich, c, 1120, a, number, of, depictions, of, the, fully, developed, cross, hilt, dagger, are, found, in, the, morgan, bible, c, 1240, many, of, these, cross, hilt, daggers, resemble, miniature, swords, with, cross, guards, and, pommels, very, similar, in, form, to, swords, of, the, period, others, however, are, not, an, exact, match, to, known, sword, designs, having, for, example, pommel, caps, large, hollow, star, shaped, pommels, on, so, called, burgundian, heraldic, daggers, or, antenna, style, cross, and, pommel, reminiscent, of, hallstatt, era, daggers, the, cross, hilt, type, persisted, well, into, the, renaissance, the, old, french, term, dague, appears, to, have, referred, to, these, weapons, in, the, 13th, century, alongside, other, terms, such, as, poignal, and, basilard, the, middle, english, dagger, is, used, from, the, 1380s, during, this, time, the, dagger, was, often, employed, in, the, role, of, a, secondary, defense, weapon, in, close, combat, the, knightly, dagger, evolved, into, the, larger, baselard, knife, in, the, 14th, century, during, the, 14th, century, it, became, fairly, common, for, knights, to, fight, on, foot, to, strengthen, the, infantry, defensive, line, this, necessitated, more, use, of, daggers, at, agincourt, 1415, archers, used, them, to, dispatch, dismounted, knights, by, thrusting, the, narrow, blades, through, helmet, vents, and, other, apertures, the, baselard, was, considered, an, intermediate, between, a, short, sword, and, a, long, dagger, and, became, popular, also, as, a, civilian, weapon, sloane, ms, 2593, c, 1400, records, a, song, satirizing, the, use, of, oversized, baselard, knives, as, fashion, accessories, weapons, of, this, sort, called, anelace, somewhere, between, a, large, dagger, and, a, short, sword, were, much, in, use, in, 14th, century, england, as, civilians, accoutrements, worn, suspended, by, a, ring, from, the, girdle, in, the, late, middle, ages, knives, with, blade, designs, that, emphasized, thrusting, attacks, such, as, the, stiletto, became, increasingly, popular, and, some, thrusting, knives, commonly, referred, to, as, daggers, ceased, to, have, a, cutting, edge, this, was, a, response, to, the, deployment, of, heavy, armor, such, as, maille, and, plate, armour, where, cutting, attacks, were, ineffective, and, focus, was, on, thrusts, with, narrow, blades, to, punch, through, mail, or, aim, at, armour, plate, intersections, or, the, eye, slits, of, the, helmet, visor, these, late, medieval, thrusting, weapons, are, sometimes, classed, by, the, shape, of, their, hilt, as, either, roundel, bollock, or, ear, daggers, the, term, dagger, is, coined, in, this, time, as, are, the, early, modern, german, equivalents, dolch, tolch, and, degen, tegen, in, the, german, school, of, fencing, johannes, liechtenauer, ms, 3227a, and, his, successors, specifically, andres, lignizer, in, cod, 44, a, 8, taught, fighting, with, the, dagger, these, techniques, in, some, respects, resemble, modern, knife, fighting, but, emphasized, thrusting, strokes, almost, exclusively, instead, of, slashes, and, cuts, when, used, offensively, a, standard, attack, frequently, employed, the, reverse, or, icepick, grip, stabbing, downward, with, the, blade, to, increase, thrust, and, penetrative, force, this, was, done, primarily, because, the, blade, point, frequently, had, to, penetrate, or, push, apart, an, opponent, s, steel, chain, mail, or, plate, armor, in, order, to, inflict, an, injury, the, disadvantage, of, employing, the, medieval, dagger, in, this, manner, was, that, it, could, easily, be, blocked, by, a, variety, of, techniques, most, notably, by, a, block, with, the, weaponless, arm, while, simultaneously, attacking, with, a, weapon, held, in, the, right, hand, another, disadvantage, was, the, reduction, in, effective, blade, reach, to, the, opponent, when, using, a, reverse, grip, as, the, wearing, of, armor, fell, out, of, favor, dagger, fighting, techniques, began, to, evolve, which, emphasized, the, use, of, the, dagger, with, a, conventional, or, forward, grip, while, the, reverse, or, icepick, grip, was, retained, when, attacking, an, unsuspecting, opponent, from, behind, such, as, in, an, assassination, the, dagger, was, very, popular, as, a, fencing, and, personal, defense, weapon, in, 17th, and, 18th, century, spain, where, it, was, referred, to, as, the, daga, or, pu, al, during, the, renaissance, age, the, dagger, was, used, as, part, of, everyday, dress, and, daggers, were, the, only, weapon, commoners, were, allowed, to, carry, on, their, person, in, english, the, terms, poniard, and, dirk, are, loaned, during, the, late, 16th, to, early, 17th, century, the, latter, in, the, spelling, dork, durk, presumably, via, low, german, dutch, or, scandinavian, dolk, dolch, ultimately, from, a, west, slavic, tulich, the, modern, spelling, dirk, dating, to, 18th, century, scots, beginning, in, the, 17th, century, another, form, of, dagger, the, plug, bayonet, and, later, the, socket, bayonet, was, used, to, convert, muskets, and, other, longarms, into, spears, by, mounting, them, on, the, barrel, they, were, periodically, used, for, eating, the, arm, was, also, used, for, a, variety, of, other, tasks, such, as, mending, boots, house, repairs, and, farm, jobs, the, final, function, of, the, dagger, was, as, an, obvious, and, ostentatious, means, of, enhancing, a, man, s, personal, apparel, conforming, to, fashion, which, dictated, that, all, men, carried, them, ww1, trench, warfare, caused, daggers, and, fighting, knives, to, come, back, in, play, they, also, replaced, the, sabres, worn, by, officers, which, were, too, long, and, clumsy, for, trench, warfare, they, were, worn, with, pride, as, a, sign, of, having, served, front, line, duty, daggers, achieved, public, notoriety, in, the, 20th, century, as, ornamental, uniform, regalia, during, the, fascist, dictatorships, of, mussolini, s, italy, and, hitler, s, germany, dress, daggers, were, used, by, several, other, countries, as, well, including, japan, but, never, to, the, same, extent, as, combat, equipment, they, were, carried, by, many, infantry, and, commando, forces, during, the, second, world, war, british, commando, and, other, elite, units, were, issued, an, especially, slender, dagger, the, fairbairn, sykes, fighting, knife, developed, by, william, e, fairbairn, and, eric, a, sykes, from, real, life, close, combat, experiences, gained, while, serving, on, the, shanghai, municipal, police, force, the, f, s, dagger, proved, very, popular, with, the, commandos, who, used, it, primarily, for, sentry, elimination, some, units, of, the, u, s, marine, corps, raiders, in, the, pacific, were, issued, a, similar, fighting, dagger, the, marine, raider, stiletto, though, this, modified, design, proved, less, than, successful, when, used, in, the, type, of, knife, combat, encountered, in, the, pacific, theater, due, to, this, version, using, inferior, materials, and, manufacturing, techniques, during, the, vietnam, war, the, gerber, mark, ii, designed, by, us, army, captain, bud, holzman, and, al, mar, was, a, popular, fighting, knife, pattern, that, was, privately, purchased, by, many, u, s, soldiers, and, marines, who, served, in,

boot, knife, the, boot, knife, is, nothing, more, than, a, shortened, dagger, that, is, compact, enough, to, be, worn, on, the, lower, leg, usually, by, means, of, a, sheath, clipped, or, strapped, to, a, boot, or, other, footwear, the, dagger, is, symbolically, ambiguous, for, some, cultures, and, military, organizations, the, dagger, symbolizes, courage, and, daring, in, combat, however, daggers, may, be, associated, with, deception, or, treachery, due, to, the, ease, of, concealment, and, surprise, that, the, user, could, inflict, upon, an, unsuspecting, victim, indeed, many, assassinations, have, been, carried, out, with, the, use, of, a, dagger, including, that, of, julius, caesar, a, cloak, and, dagger, attack, is, one, in, which, a, deceitful, traitorous, or,
