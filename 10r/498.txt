from, close, ranged, weaponry, or, projectiles, such, as, arrows, by, means, of, active, blocks, as, well, as, to, provide, passive, protection, by, closing, one, or, more, lines, of, engagement, during, combat, shields, vary, greatly, in, size, and, shape, ranging, from, large, panels, that, protect, the, user, s, whole, body, to, small, models, such, as, the, buckler, that, were, intended, for, hand, to, hand, combat, use, shields, also, vary, a, great, deal, in, thickness, whereas, some, shields, were, made, of, relatively, deep, absorbent, wooden, planking, to, protect, soldiers, from, the, impact, of, spears, and, crossbow, bolts, others, were, thinner, and, lighter, and, designed, mainly, for, deflecting, blade, strikes, like, the, roromaraugi, or, qauata, finally, shields, vary, greatly, in, shape, ranging, in, roundness, to, angularity, proportional, length, and, width, symmetry, and, edge, pattern, different, shapes, provide, more, optimal, protection, for, infantry, or, cavalry, enhance, portability, provide, secondary, uses, such, as, ship, protection, or, as, a, weapon, and, so, on, in, prehistory, and, during, the, era, of, the, earliest, civilisations, shields, were, made, of, wood, animal, hide, woven, reeds, or, wicker, in, classical, antiquity, the, barbarian, invasions, and, the, middle, ages, they, were, normally, constructed, of, poplar, tree, lime, or, another, split, resistant, timber, covered, in, some, instances, with, a, material, such, as, leather, or, rawhide, and, often, reinforced, with, a, metal, boss, rim, or, banding, they, were, carried, by, foot, soldiers, knights, and, cavalry, depending, on, time, and, place, shields, could, be, round, oval, square, rectangular, triangular, bilabial, or, scalloped, sometimes, they, took, on, the, form, of, kites, or, flatirons, or, had, rounded, tops, on, a, rectangular, base, with, perhaps, an, eye, hole, to, look, through, when, used, with, combat, the, shield, was, held, by, a, central, grip, or, by, straps, with, some, going, over, or, around, the, user, s, arm, and, one, or, more, being, held, by, the, hand, often, shields, were, decorated, with, a, painted, pattern, or, an, animal, representation, to, show, their, army, or, clan, these, designs, developed, into, systematized, heraldic, devices, during, the, high, middle, ages, for, purposes, of, battlefield, identification, even, after, the, introduction, of, gunpowder, and, firearms, to, the, battlefield, shields, continued, to, be, used, by, certain, groups, in, the, 18th, century, for, example, scottish, highland, fighters, liked, to, wield, small, shields, known, as, targes, and, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, some, non, industrialized, peoples, such, as, zulu, warriors, employed, them, when, waging, wars, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, century, shields, have, been, used, by, military, and, police, units, that, specialize, in, anti, terrorist, actions, hostage, rescue, riot, control, and, siege, breaking, the, oldest, form, of, shield, was, a, protection, device, designed, to, block, attacks, by, hand, weapons, such, as, swords, axes, and, maces, or, ranged, weapons, like, sling, stones, and, arrows, shields, have, varied, greatly, in, construction, over, time, and, place, sometimes, shields, were, made, of, metal, but, wood, or, animal, hide, construction, was, much, more, common, wicker, and, even, turtle, shells, have, been, used, many, surviving, examples, of, metal, shields, are, generally, felt, to, be, ceremonial, rather, than, practical, for, example, the, yetholm, type, shields, of, the, bronze, age, or, the, iron, age, battersea, shield, size, and, weight, varied, greatly, lightly, armored, warriors, relying, on, speed, and, surprise, would, generally, carry, light, shields, pelte, that, were, either, small, or, thin, heavy, troops, might, be, equipped, with, robust, shields, that, could, cover, most, of, the, body, many, had, a, strap, called, a, guige, that, allowed, them, to, be, slung, over, the, user, s, back, when, not, in, use, or, on, horseback, during, the, 14th, 13th, century, bc, the, sards, or, shardana, working, as, mercenaries, for, the, egyptian, pharaoh, ramses, ii, utilized, either, large, or, small, round, shields, against, the, hittites, the, mycenaean, greeks, used, two, types, of, shields, the, figure, of, eight, shield, and, a, rectangular, tower, shield, these, shields, were, made, primarily, from, a, wicker, frame, and, then, reinforced, with, leather, covering, the, body, from, head, to, foot, the, figure, of, eight, and, tower, shield, offered, most, of, the, warrior, s, body, a, good, deal, of, protection, in, hand, to, hand, combat, the, ancient, greek, hoplites, used, a, round, bowl, shaped, wooden, shield, that, was, reinforced, with, bronze, and, called, an, aspis, the, aspis, was, also, the, longest, lasting, and, most, famous, and, influential, of, all, of, the, ancient, greek, shields, the, spartans, used, the, aspis, to, create, the, greek, phalanx, formation, their, shields, offered, protection, not, only, for, themselves, but, for, their, comrades, to, their, left, examples, of, germanic, wooden, shields, circa, 350, bc, 500, ad, survive, from, weapons, sacrifices, in, danish, bogs, the, heavily, armored, roman, legionaries, carried, large, shields, scuta, that, could, provide, far, more, protection, but, made, swift, movement, a, little, more, difficult, the, scutum, originally, had, an, oval, shape, but, gradually, the, curved, tops, and, sides, were, cut, to, produce, the, familiar, rectangular, shape, most, commonly, seen, in, the, early, imperial, legions, famously, the, romans, used, their, shields, to, create, a, tortoise, like, formation, called, a, testudo, in, which, entire, groups, of, soldiers, would, be, enclosed, in, an, armoured, box, to, provide, protection, against, missiles, many, ancient, shield, designs, featured, incuts, of, one, sort, or, another, this, was, done, to, accommodate, the, shaft, of, a, spear, thus, facilitating, tactics, requiring, the, soldiers, to, stand, close, together, forming, a, wall, of, shields, typical, in, the, early, european, middle, ages, were, round, shields, with, light, non, splitting, wood, like, linden, fir, alder, or, poplar, usually, reinforced, with, leather, cover, on, one, or, both, sides, and, occasionally, metal, rims, encircling, a, metal, shield, boss, these, light, shields, suited, a, fighting, style, where, each, incoming, blow, is, intercepted, with, the, boss, in, order, to, deflect, it, the, normans, introduced, the, kite, shield, around, the, 10th, century, which, was, rounded, at, the, top, and, tapered, at, the, bottom, this, gave, some, protection, to, the, user, s, legs, without, adding, too, much, to, the, total, weight, of, the, shield, the, kite, shield, predominantly, features, enarmes, leather, straps, used, to, grip, the, shield, tight, to, the, arm, used, by, foot, and, mounted, troops, alike, it, gradually, came, to, replace, the, round, shield, as, the, common, choice, until, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, when, more, efficient, limb, armour, allowed, the, shields, to, grow, shorter, and, be, entirely, replaced, by, the, 14th, century, as, body, armour, improved, knight, s, shields, became, smaller, leading, to, the, familiar, heater, shield, style, both, kite, and, heater, style, shields, were, made, of, several, layers, of, laminated, wood, with, a, gentle, curve, in, cross, section, the, heater, style, inspired, the, shape, of, the, symbolic, heraldic, shield, that, is, still, used, today, eventually, specialised, shapes, were, developed, such, as, the, bouche, which, had, a, lance, rest, cut, into, the, upper, corner, of, the, lance, side, to, help, guide, it, in, combat, or, tournament, free, standing, shields, called, pavises, which, were, propped, up, on, stands, were, used, by, medieval, crossbowmen, who, needed, protection, while, reloading, in, time, some, armoured, foot, knights, gave, up, shields, entirely, in, favour, of, mobility, and, two, handed, weapons, other, knights, and, common, soldiers, adopted, the, buckler, giving, rise, to, the, term, swashbuckler, the, buckler, is, a, small, round, shield, typically, between, 8, and, 16, inches, 20, 40, cm, in, diameter, the, buckler, was, one, of, very, few, types, of, shield, that, were, usually, made, of, metal, small, and, light, the, buckler, was, easily, carried, by, being, hung, from, a, belt, it, gave, little, protection, from, missiles, and, was, reserved, for, hand, to, hand, combat, where, it, served, both, for, protection, and, offence, the, buckler, s, use, began, in, the, middle, ages, and, continued, well, into, the, 16th, century, in, italy, the, targa, parma, and, rotella, were, used, by, common, people, fencers, and, even, knights, the, development, of, plate, armour, made, shields, less, and, less, common, as, it, eliminated, the, need, for, a, shield, lightly, armoured, troops, continued, to, use, shields, after, men, at, arms, and, knights, ceased, to, use, them, shields, continued, in, use, even, after, gunpowder, powered, weapons, made, them, essentially, obsolete, on, the, battlefield, in, the, 18th, century, the, scottish, clans, used, a, small, round, targe, that, was, partially, effective, against, the, firearms, of, the, time, although, it, was, arguably, more, often, used, against, british, infantry, bayonets, and, cavalry, swords, in, close, in, fighting, during, the, 19th, century, non, industrial, cultures, with, little, access, to, guns, were, still, using, war, shields, zulu, warriors, carried, large, lightweight, shields, called, ishlangu, made, from, a, single, ox, hide, supported, by, a, wooden, spine, this, was, used, in, combination, with, a, short, spear, iklwa, and, or, club, other, african, shields, include, glagwa, from, cameroon, or, nguba, from, congo, shields, for, protection, from, armed, attack, are, still, used, by, many, police, forces, around, the, world, these, modern, shields, are, usually, intended, for, two, broadly, distinct, purposes, the, first, type, riot, shields, are, used, for, riot, control, and, can, be, made, from, metal, or, polymers, such, as, polycarbonate, lexan, or, makrolon, or, bopet, mylar, these, typically, offer, protection, from, relatively, large, and, low, velocity, projectiles, such, as, rocks, and, bottles, as, well, as, blows, from, fists, or, clubs, synthetic, riot, shields, are, normally, transparent, allowing, full, use, of, the, shield, without, obstructing, vision, similarly, metal, riot, shields, often, have, a, small, window, at, eye, level, for, this, purpose, these, riot, shields, are, most, commonly, used, to, block, and, push, back, crowds, when, the, users, stand, in, a, wall, to, block, protesters, and, to, protect, against, shrapnel, projectiles, like, stones, and, bricks, molotov, cocktails, and, during, hand, to, hand, combat, the, second, type, of, modern, police, shield, is, the, bullet, resistant, ballistic, shield, also, called, tactical, shield, these, shields, are, typically, manufactured, from, advanced, synthetics, such, as, kevlar, and, are, designed, to, be, bulletproof, or, at, least, bullet, resistant, two, types, of, shields, are, available, tactical, shields, often, have, a, firing, port, so, that, the, officer, holding, the, shield, can, fire, a, weapon, while, being, protected, by, the, shield, and, they, often, have, a, bulletproof, glass, viewing, port, they, are, typically, employed, by, specialist, police, such, as, swat, teams, in, high, risk, entry, and, siege, scenarios, such, as, hostage, rescue, and, breaching, gang, compounds, as, well, as, in, antiterrorism, operations, law, enforcement, shields, often, have, a, large, signs, stating, police, or, the, name, of, a, force, such, as, us, marshals, to, indicate, that, the, user, is, a, law, enforcement, officer
