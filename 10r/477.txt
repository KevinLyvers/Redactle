electrocardiography, is, the, process, of, producing, an, electrocardiogram, ecg, or, ekg, a, recording, of, the, heart, s, electrical, activity, through, repeated, cardiac, cycles, it, is, an, electrogram, of, the, heart, which, is, a, graph, of, voltage, versus, time, of, the, electrical, activity, of, the, heart, using, electrodes, placed, on, the, skin, these, electrodes, detect, the, small, electrical, changes, that, are, a, consequence, of, cardiac, muscle, depolarization, followed, by, repolarization, during, each, cardiac, cycle, heartbeat, changes, in, the, normal, ecg, pattern, occur, in, numerous, cardiac, abnormalities, including, traditionally, ecg, usually, means, a, 12, lead, ecg, taken, while, lying, down, as, discussed, below, however, other, devices, can, record, the, electrical, activity, of, the, heart, such, as, a, holter, monitor, but, also, some, models, of, smartwatch, are, capable, of, recording, an, ecg, ecg, signals, can, be, recorded, in, other, contexts, with, other, devices, in, a, conventional, 12, lead, ecg, ten, electrodes, are, placed, on, the, patient, s, limbs, and, on, the, surface, of, the, chest, the, overall, magnitude, of, the, heart, s, electrical, potential, is, then, measured, from, twelve, different, angles, leads, and, is, recorded, over, a, period, of, time, usually, ten, seconds, in, this, way, the, overall, magnitude, and, direction, of, the, heart, s, electrical, depolarization, is, captured, at, each, moment, throughout, the, cardiac, cycle, there, are, three, main, components, to, an, ecg, during, each, heartbeat, a, healthy, heart, has, an, orderly, progression, of, depolarization, that, starts, with, pacemaker, cells, in, the, sinoatrial, node, spreads, throughout, the, atrium, and, passes, through, the, atrioventricular, node, down, into, the, bundle, of, his, and, into, the, purkinje, fibers, spreading, down, and, to, the, left, throughout, the, ventricles, this, orderly, pattern, of, depolarization, gives, rise, to, the, characteristic, ecg, tracing, to, the, trained, clinician, an, ecg, conveys, a, large, amount, of, information, about, the, structure, of, the, heart, and, the, function, of, its, electrical, conduction, system, among, other, things, an, ecg, can, be, used, to, measure, the, rate, and, rhythm, of, heartbeats, the, size, and, position, of, the, heart, chambers, the, presence, of, any, damage, to, the, heart, s, muscle, cells, or, conduction, system, the, effects, of, heart, drugs, and, the, function, of, implanted, pacemakers, the, overall, goal, of, performing, an, ecg, is, to, obtain, information, about, the, electrical, functioning, of, the, heart, medical, uses, for, this, information, are, varied, and, often, need, to, be, combined, with, knowledge, of, the, structure, of, the, heart, and, physical, examination, signs, to, be, interpreted, some, indications, for, performing, an, ecg, include, the, following, ecgs, can, be, recorded, as, short, intermittent, tracings, or, continuous, ecg, monitoring, continuous, monitoring, is, used, for, critically, ill, patients, patients, undergoing, general, anesthesia, and, patients, who, have, an, infrequently, occurring, cardiac, arrhythmia, that, would, unlikely, be, seen, on, a, conventional, ten, second, ecg, continuous, monitoring, can, be, conducted, by, using, holter, monitors, internal, and, external, defibrillators, and, pacemakers, and, or, biotelemetry, for, adults, evidence, does, not, support, the, use, of, ecgs, among, those, without, symptoms, or, at, low, risk, of, cardiovascular, disease, as, an, effort, for, prevention, this, is, because, an, ecg, may, falsely, indicate, the, existence, of, a, problem, leading, to, misdiagnosis, the, recommendation, of, invasive, procedures, and, overtreatment, however, persons, employed, in, certain, critical, occupations, such, as, aircraft, pilots, may, be, required, to, have, an, ecg, as, part, of, their, routine, health, evaluations, hypertrophic, cardiomyopathy, screening, may, also, be, considered, in, adolescents, as, part, of, a, sports, physical, out, of, concern, for, sudden, cardiac, death, electrocardiograms, are, recorded, by, machines, that, consist, of, a, set, of, electrodes, connected, to, a, central, unit, early, ecg, machines, were, constructed, with, analog, electronics, where, the, signal, drove, a, motor, to, print, out, the, signal, onto, paper, today, electrocardiographs, use, analog, to, digital, converters, to, convert, the, electrical, activity, of, the, heart, to, a, digital, signal, many, ecg, machines, are, now, portable, and, commonly, include, a, screen, keyboard, and, printer, on, a, small, wheeled, cart, recent, advancements, in, electrocardiography, include, developing, even, smaller, devices, for, inclusion, in, fitness, trackers, and, smart, watches, these, smaller, devices, often, rely, on, only, two, electrodes, to, deliver, a, single, lead, i, portable, twelve, lead, devices, powered, by, batteries, are, also, available, recording, an, ecg, is, a, safe, and, painless, procedure, the, machines, are, powered, by, mains, power, but, they, are, designed, with, several, safety, features, including, an, earthed, ground, lead, other, features, include, most, modern, ecg, machines, include, automated, interpretation, algorithms, this, analysis, calculates, features, such, as, the, pr, interval, qt, interval, corrected, qt, qtc, interval, pr, axis, qrs, axis, rhythm, and, more, the, results, from, these, automated, algorithms, are, considered, preliminary, until, verified, and, or, modified, by, expert, interpretation, despite, recent, advances, computer, misinterpretation, remains, a, significant, problem, and, can, result, in, clinical, mismanagement, besides, the, standard, electrocardiograph, machine, there, are, other, devices, capable, of, recording, ecg, signals, portable, devices, have, existed, since, the, holter, monitor, was, produced, in, 1962, traditionally, these, monitors, have, used, electrodes, with, patches, on, the, skin, to, record, the, ecg, but, new, devices, can, stick, to, the, chest, as, a, single, patch, without, need, for, wires, developed, by, zio, zio, xt, tz, medical, trident, philips, biotel, and, bardydx, cam, among, many, others, implantable, devices, such, as, the, artificial, cardiac, pacemaker, and, implantable, cardioverter, defibrillator, are, capable, of, measuring, a, far, field, signal, between, the, leads, in, the, heart, and, the, implanted, battery, generator, that, resembles, an, ecg, signal, technically, the, signal, recorded, in, the, heart, is, called, an, electrogram, which, is, interpreted, differently, advancement, of, the, holter, monitor, became, the, implantable, loop, recorder, that, performs, the, same, function, but, in, an, implantable, device, with, batteries, that, last, on, the, order, of, years, additionally, there, are, available, various, arduino, kits, with, ecg, sensor, modules, and, smartwatch, devices, that, are, capable, of, recording, an, ecg, signal, as, well, such, as, with, the, 4th, generation, apple, watch, samsung, galaxy, watch, 4, and, newer, devices, electrodes, are, the, actual, conductive, pads, attached, to, the, body, surface, any, pair, of, electrodes, can, measure, the, electrical, potential, difference, between, the, two, corresponding, locations, of, attachment, such, a, pair, forms, a, lead, however, leads, can, also, be, formed, between, a, physical, electrode, and, a, virtual, electrode, known, as, wilson, s, central, terminal, wct, whose, potential, is, defined, as, the, average, potential, measured, by, three, limb, electrodes, that, are, attached, to, the, right, arm, the, left, arm, and, the, left, foot, respectively, commonly, 10, electrodes, attached, to, the, body, are, used, to, form, 12, ecg, leads, with, each, lead, measuring, a, specific, electrical, potential, difference, as, listed, in, the, table, below, leads, are, broken, down, into, three, types, limb, augmented, limb, and, precordial, or, chest, the, 12, lead, ecg, has, a, total, of, three, limb, leads, and, three, augmented, limb, leads, arranged, like, spokes, of, a, wheel, in, the, coronal, plane, vertical, and, six, precordial, leads, or, chest, leads, that, lie, on, the, perpendicular, transverse, plane, horizontal, in, medical, settings, the, term, leads, is, also, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, the, wires, or, to, the, electrodes, themselves, although, this, is, technically, incorrect, the, term, leads, should, be, reserved, for, the, electrocardiographic, measurements, or, for, their, graphical, representations, the, 10, electrodes, in, a, 12, lead, ecg, are, listed, below, two, types, of, electrodes, in, common, use, are, a, flat, paper, thin, sticker, and, a, self, adhesive, circular, pad, the, former, are, typically, used, in, a, single, ecg, recording, while, the, latter, are, for, continuous, recordings, as, they, stick, longer, each, electrode, consists, of, an, electrically, conductive, electrolyte, gel, and, a, silver, silver, chloride, conductor, the, gel, typically, contains, potassium, chloride, sometimes, silver, chloride, as, well, to, permit, electron, conduction, from, the, skin, to, the, wire, and, to, the, electrocardiogram, the, common, virtual, electrode, known, as, wilson, s, central, terminal, v, w, is, produced, by, averaging, the, measurements, from, the, electrodes, ra, la, and, ll, to, give, an, average, potential, of, the, body, in, a, 12, lead, ecg, all, leads, except, the, limb, leads, are, assumed, to, be, unipolar, avr, avl, avf, v, 1, v, 2, v, 3, v, 4, v, 5, and, v, 6, the, measurement, of, a, voltage, requires, two, contacts, and, so, electrically, the, unipolar, leads, are, measured, from, the, common, lead, negative, and, the, unipolar, lead, positive, this, averaging, for, the, common, lead, and, the, abstract, unipolar, lead, concept, makes, for, a, more, challenging, understanding, and, is, complicated, by, sloppy, usage, of, lead, and, electrode, in, fact, instead, of, being, a, constant, reference, v, w, has, a, value, that, fluctuates, throughout, the, heart, cycle, it, also, does, not, truly, represent, the, center, of, heart, potential, due, to, the, body, parts, the, signals, travel, through, because, voltage, is, by, definition, a, bipolar, measurement, between, two, points, describing, an, electrocardiographic, lead, as, unipolar, makes, little, sense, electrically, and, should, be, avoided, the, american, heart, association, states, all, leads, are, effectively, bipolar, and, the, term, unipolar, in, description, of, the, augmented, limb, leads, and, the, precordial, leads, lacks, precision, leads, i, ii, and, iii, are, called, the, limb, leads, the, electrodes, that, form, these, signals, are, located, on, the, limbs, one, on, each, arm, and, one, on, the, left, leg, the, limb, leads, form, the, points, of, what, is, known, as, einthoven, s, triangle, leads, avr, avl, and, avf, are, the, augmented, limb, leads, they, are, derived, from, the, same, three, electrodes, as, leads, i, ii, and, iii, but, they, use, goldberger, s, central, terminal, as, their, negative, pole, goldberger, s, central, terminal, is, a, combination, of, inputs, from, two, limb, electrodes, with, a, different, combination, for, each, augmented, lead, it, is, referred, to, immediately, below, as, the, negative, pole, together, with, leads, i, ii, and, iii, augmented, limb, leads, avr, avl, and, avf, form, the, basis, of, the, hexaxial, reference, system, which, is, used, to, calculate, the, heart, s, electrical, axis, in, the, frontal, plane, older, versions, of, the, nodes, vr, vl, vf, use, wilson, s, central, terminal, as, the, negative, pole, but, the, amplitude, is, too, small, for, the, thick, lines, of, old, ecg, machines, the, goldberger, terminals, scale, up, augments, the, wilson, results, by, 50, at, the, cost, of, sacrificing, physical, correctness, by, not, having, the, same, negative, pole, for, all, three, the, precordial, leads, lie, in, the, transverse, horizontal, plane, perpendicular, to, the, other, six, leads, the, six, precordial, electrodes, act, as, the, positive, poles, for, the, six, corresponding, precordial, leads, v, 1, v, 2, v, 3, v, 4, v, 5, and, v, 6, wilson, s, central, terminal, is, used, as, the, negative, pole, recently, unipolar, precordial, leads, have, been, used, to, create, bipolar, precordial, leads, that, explore, the, right, to, left, axis, in, the, horizontal, plane, additional, electrodes, may, rarely, be, placed, to, generate, other, leads, for, specific, diagnostic, purposes, right, sided, precordial, leads, may, be, used, to, better, study, pathology, of, the, right, ventricle, or, for, dextrocardia, and, are, denoted, with, an, r, e, g, v, 5r, posterior, leads, v, 7, to, v, 9, may, be, used, to, demonstrate, the, presence, of, a, posterior, myocardial, infarction, the, lewis, lead, or, s5, lead, requiring, an, electrode, at, the, right, sternal, border, in, the, second, intercostal, space, can, be, used, to, better, detect, atrial, activity, in, relation, to, that, of, the, ventricles, an, esophageal, lead, can, be, inserted, to, a, part, of, the, esophagus, where, the, distance, to, the, posterior, wall, of, the, left, atrium, is, only, approximately, 5, 6, mm, remaining, constant, in, people, of, different, age, and, weight, an, esophageal, lead, avails, for, a, more, accurate, differentiation, between, certain, cardiac, arrhythmias, particularly, atrial, flutter, av, nodal, reentrant, tachycardia, and, orthodromic, atrioventricular, reentrant, tachycardia, it, can, also, evaluate, the, risk, in, people, with, wolff, parkinson, white, syndrome, as, well, as, terminate, supraventricular, tachycardia, caused, by, re, entry, an, intracardiac, electrogram, iceg, is, essentially, an, ecg, with, some, added, intracardiac, leads, that, is, inside, the, heart, the, standard, ecg, leads, external, leads, are, i, ii, iii, avl, v, 1, and, v, 6, two, to, four, intracardiac, leads, are, added, via, cardiac, catheterization, the, word, electrogram, egm, without, further, specification, usually, means, an, intracardiac, electrogram, a, standard, 12, lead, ecg, report, an, electrocardiograph, shows, a, 2, 5, second, tracing, of, each, of, the, twelve, leads, the, tracings, are, most, commonly, arranged, in, a, grid, of, four, columns, and, three, rows, the, first, column, is, the, limb, leads, i, ii, and, iii, the, second, column, is, the, augmented, limb, leads, avr, avl, and, avf, and, the, last, two, columns, are, the, precordial, leads, v, 1, to, v, 6, additionally, a, rhythm, strip, may, be, included, as, a, fourth, or, fifth, row, the, timing, across, the, page, is, continuous, and, notes, tracings, of, the, 12, leads, for, the, same, time, period, in, other, words, if, the, output, were, traced, by, needles, on, paper, each, row, would, switch, which, leads, as, the, paper, is, pulled, under, the, needle, for, example, the, top, row, would, first, trace, lead, i, then, switch, to, lead, avr, then, switch, to, v, 1, and, then, switch, to, v, 4, and, so, none, of, these, four, tracings, of, the, leads, are, from, the, same, time, period, as, they, are, traced, in, sequence, through, time, each, of, the, 12, ecg, leads, records, the, electrical, activity, of, the, heart, from, a, different, angle, and, therefore, align, with, different, anatomical, areas, of, the, heart, two, leads, that, look, at, neighboring, anatomical, areas, are, said, to, be, contiguous, in, addition, any, two, precordial, leads, next, to, one, another, are, considered, to, be, contiguous, for, example, though, v, 4, is, an, anterior, lead, and, v, 5, is, a, lateral, lead, they, are, contiguous, because, they, are, next, to, one, another, the, study, of, the, conduction, system, of, the, heart, is, called, cardiac, electrophysiology, ep, an, ep, study, is, performed, via, a, right, sided, cardiac, catheterization, a, wire, with, an, electrode, at, its, tip, is, inserted, into, the, right, heart, chambers, from, a, peripheral, vein, and, placed, in, various, positions, in, close, proximity, to, the, conduction, system, so, that, the, electrical, activity, of, that, system, can, be, recorded, standard, catheter, positions, for, an, ep, study, include, high, right, atrium, or, hra, near, the, sinus, node, a, his, across, the, septal, wall, of, the, tricuspid, valve, to, measure, bundle, of, his, a, coronary, sinus, into, the, coronary, sinus, and, a, right, ventricle, in, the, apex, of, the, right, ventricle, interpretation, of, the, ecg, is, fundamentally, about, understanding, the, electrical, conduction, system, of, the, heart, normal, conduction, starts, and, propagates, in, a, predictable, pattern, and, deviation, from, this, pattern, can, be, a, normal, variation, or, be, pathological, an, ecg, does, not, equate, with, mechanical, pumping, activity, of, the, heart, for, example, pulseless, electrical, activity, produces, an, ecg, that, should, pump, blood, but, no, pulses, are, felt, and, constitutes, a, medical, emergency, and, cpr, should, be, performed, ventricular, fibrillation, produces, an, ecg, but, is, too, dysfunctional, to, produce, a, life, sustaining, cardiac, output, certain, rhythms, are, known, to, have, good, cardiac, output, and, some, are, known, to, have, bad, cardiac, output, ultimately, an, echocardiogram, or, other, anatomical, imaging, modality, is, useful, in, assessing, the, mechanical, function, of, the, heart, like, all, medical, tests, what, constitutes, normal, is, based, on, population, studies, the, heartrate, range, of, between, 60, and, 100, beats, per, minute, bpm, is, considered, normal, since, data, shows, this, to, be, the, usual, resting, heart, rate, interpretation, of, the, ecg, is, ultimately, that, of, pattern, recognition, in, order, to, understand, the, patterns, found, it, is, helpful, to, understand, the, theory, of, what, ecgs, represent, the, theory, is, rooted, in, electromagnetics, and, boils, down, to, the, four, following, points, thus, the, overall, direction, of, depolarization, and, repolarization, produces, positive, or, negative, deflection, on, each, lead, s, trace, for, example, depolarizing, from, right, to, left, would, produce, a, positive, deflection, in, lead, i, because, the, two, vectors, point, in, the, same, direction, in, contrast, that, same, depolarization, would, produce, minimal, deflection, in, v, 1, and, v, 2, because, the, vectors, are, perpendicular, and, this, phenomenon, is, called, isoelectric, normal, rhythm, produces, four, entities, a, p, wave, a, qrs, complex, a, t, wave, and, a, u, wave, that, each, have, a, fairly, unique, pattern, changes, in, the, structure, of, the, heart, and, its, surroundings, including, blood, composition, change, the, patterns, of, these, four, entities, the, u, wave, is, not, typically, seen, and, its, absence, is, generally, ignored, atrial, repolarization, is, typically, hidden, in, the, much, more, prominent, qrs, complex, and, normally, cannot, be, seen, without, additional, specialized, electrodes, ecgs, are, normally, printed, on, a, grid, the, horizontal, axis, represents, time, and, the, vertical, axis, represents, voltage, the, standard, values, on, this, grid, are, shown, in, the, adjacent, image, at, 25mm, sec, the, large, box, is, represented, by, a, heavier, line, weight, than, the, small, boxes, the, standard, printing, speed, in, the, united, states, is, 25, mm, per, sec, 5, big, boxes, per, second, but, in, other, countries, it, can, be, 50, mm, per, sec, faster, speeds, such, as, 100, and, 200, mm, per, sec, are, used, during, electrophysiology, studies, not, all, aspects, of, an, ecg, rely, on, precise, recordings, or, having, a, known, scaling, of, amplitude, or, time, for, example, determining, if, the, tracing, is, a, sinus, rhythm, only, requires, feature, recognition, and, matching, and, not, measurement, of, amplitudes, or, times, i, e, the, scale, of, the, grids, are, irrelevant, an, example, to, the, contrary, the, voltage, requirements, of, left, ventricular, hypertrophy, require, knowing, the, grid, scale, in, a, normal, heart, the, heart, rate, is, the, rate, at, which, the, sinoatrial, node, depolarizes, since, it, is, the, source, of, depolarization, of, the, heart, heart, rate, like, other, vital, signs, such, as, blood, pressure, and, respiratory, rate, change, with, age, in, adults, a, normal, heart, rate, is, between, 60, and, 100, bpm, normocardic, whereas, it, is, higher, in, children, a, heart, rate, below, normal, is, called, bradycardia, 60, in, adults, and, above, normal, is, called, tachycardia, 100, in, adults, a, complication, of, this, is, when, the, atria, and, ventricles, are, not, in, synchrony, and, the, heart, rate, must, be, specified, as, atrial, or, ventricular, e, g, the, ventricular, rate, in, ventricular, fibrillation, is, 300, 600, bpm, whereas, the, atrial, rate, can, be, normal, or, faster, in, normal, resting, hearts, the, physiologic, rhythm, of, the, heart, is, normal, sinus, rhythm, nsr, normal, sinus, rhythm, produces, the, prototypical, pattern, of, p, wave, qrs, complex, and, t, wave, generally, deviation, from, normal, sinus, rhythm, is, considered, a, cardiac, arrhythmia, thus, the, first, question, in, interpreting, an, ecg, is, whether, or, not, there, is, a, sinus, rhythm, a, criterion, for, sinus, rhythm, is, that, p, waves, and, qrs, complexes, appear, 1, to, 1, thus, implying, that, the, p, wave, causes, the, qrs, complex, once, sinus, rhythm, is, established, or, not, the, second, question, is, the, rate, for, a, sinus, rhythm, this, is, either, the, rate, of, p, waves, or, qrs, complexes, since, they, are, 1, to, 1, if, the, rate, is, too, fast, then, it, is, sinus, tachycardia, and, if, it, is, too, slow, then, it, is, sinus, bradycardia, if, it, is, not, a, sinus, rhythm, then, determining, the, rhythm, is, necessary, before, proceeding, with, further, interpretation, some, arrhythmias, with, characteristic, findings, determination, of, rate, and, rhythm, is, necessary, in, order, to, make, sense, of, further, interpretation, the, heart, has, several, axes, but, the, most, common, by, far, is, the, axis, of, the, qrs, complex, references, to, the, axis, imply, the, qrs, axis, each, axis, can, be, computationally, determined, to, result, in, a, number, representing, degrees, of, deviation, from, zero, or, it, can, be, categorized, into, a, few, types, the, qrs, axis, is, the, general, direction, of, the, ventricular, depolarization, wavefront, or, mean, electrical, vector, in, the, frontal, plane, it, is, often, sufficient, to, classify, the, axis, as, one, of, three, types, normal, left, deviated, or, right, deviated, population, data, shows, that, a, normal, qrs, axis, is, from, 30, to, 105, with, 0, being, along, lead, i, and, positive, being, inferior, and, negative, being, superior, best, understood, graphically, as, the, hexaxial, reference, system, beyond, 105, is, right, axis, deviation, and, beyond, 30, is, left, axis, deviation, the, third, quadrant, of, 90, to, 180, is, very, rare, and, is, an, indeterminate, axis, a, shortcut, for, determining, if, the, qrs, axis, is, normal, is, if, the, qrs, complex, is, mostly, positive, in, lead, i, and, lead, ii, or, lead, i, and, avf, if, 90, is, the, upper, limit, of, normal, the, normal, qrs, axis, is, generally, down, and, to, the, left, following, the, anatomical, orientation, of, the, heart, within, the, chest, an, abnormal, axis, suggests, a, change, in, the, physical, shape, and, orientation, of, the, heart, or, a, defect, in, its, conduction, system, that, causes, the, ventricles, to, depolarize, in, an, abnormal, way, the, extent, of, a, normal, axis, can, be, 90, or, 105, depending, on, the, source, all, of, the, waves, on, an, ecg, tracing, and, the, intervals, between, them, have, a, predictable, time, duration, a, range, of, acceptable, amplitudes, voltages, and, a, typical, morphology, any, deviation, from, the, normal, tracing, is, potentially, pathological, and, therefore, of, clinical, significance, for, ease, of, measuring, the, amplitudes, and, intervals, an, ecg, is, printed, on, graph, paper, at, a, standard, scale, each, 1, mm, one, small, box, on, the, standard, 25mm, s, ecg, paper, represents, 40, milliseconds, of, time, on, the, x, axis, and, 0, 1, millivolts, on, the, y, axis, the, animation, shown, to, the, right, illustrates, how, the, path, of, electrical, conduction, gives, rise, to, the, ecg, waves, in, the, limb, leads, what, is, green, zone, recall, that, a, positive, current, as, created, by, depolarization, of, cardiac, cells, traveling, towards, the, positive, electrode, and, away, from, the, negative, electrode, creates, a, positive, deflection, on, the, ecg, likewise, a, positive, current, traveling, away, from, the, positive, electrode, and, towards, the, negative, electrode, creates, a, negative, deflection, on, the, ecg, the, red, arrow, represents, the, overall, direction, of, travel, of, the, depolarization, the, magnitude, of, the, red, arrow, is, proportional, to, the, amount, of, tissue, being, depolarized, at, that, instance, the, red, arrow, is, simultaneously, shown, on, the, axis, of, each, of, the, 3, limb, leads, both, the, direction, and, the, magnitude, of, the, red, arrow, s, projection, onto, the, axis, of, each, limb, lead, is, shown, with, blue, arrows, then, the, direction, and, magnitude, of, the, blue, arrows, are, what, theoretically, determine, the, deflections, on, the, ecg, for, example, as, a, blue, arrow, on, the, axis, for, lead, i, moves, from, the, negative, electrode, to, the, right, towards, the, positive, electrode, the, ecg, line, rises, creating, an, upward, wave, as, the, blue, arrow, on, the, axis, for, lead, i, moves, to, the, left, a, downward, wave, is, created, the, greater, the, magnitude, of, the, blue, arrow, the, greater, the, deflection, on, the, ecg, for, that, particular, limb, lead, frames, 1, 3, depict, the, depolarization, being, generated, in, and, spreading, through, the, sinoatrial, node, the, sa, node, is, too, small, for, its, depolarization, to, be, detected, on, most, ecgs, frames, 4, 10, depict, the, depolarization, traveling, through, the, atria, towards, the, atrioventricular, node, during, frame, 7, the, depolarization, is, traveling, through, the, largest, amount, of, tissue, in, the, atria, which, creates, the, highest, point, in, the, p, wave, frames, 11, 12, depict, the, depolarization, traveling, through, the, av, node, like, the, sa, node, the, av, node, is, too, small, for, the, depolarization, of, its, tissue, to, be, detected, on, most, ecgs, this, creates, the, flat, pr, segment, frame, 13, depicts, an, interesting, phenomenon, in, an, over, simplified, fashion, it, depicts, the, depolarization, as, it, starts, to, travel, down, the, interventricular, septum, through, the, bundle, of, his, and, bundle, branches, after, the, bundle, of, his, the, conduction, system, splits, into, the, left, bundle, branch, and, the, right, bundle, branch, both, branches, conduct, action, potentials, at, about, 1, m, s, interestingly, however, the, action, potential, starts, traveling, down, the, left, bundle, branch, about, 5, milliseconds, before, it, starts, traveling, down, the, right, bundle, branch, as, depicted, by, frame, 13, this, causes, the, depolarization, of, the, interventricular, septum, tissue, to, spread, from, left, to, right, as, depicted, by, the, red, arrow, in, frame, 14, in, some, cases, this, gives, rise, to, a, negative, deflection, after, the, pr, interval, creating, a, q, wave, such, as, the, one, seen, in, lead, i, in, the, animation, to, the, right, depending, on, the, mean, electrical, axis, of, the, heart, this, phenomenon, can, result, in, a, q, wave, in, lead, ii, as, well, following, depolarization, of, the, interventricular, septum, the, depolarization, travels, towards, the, apex, of, the, heart, this, is, depicted, by, frames, 15, 17, and, results, in, a, positive, deflection, on, all, three, limb, leads, which, creates, the, r, wave, frames, 18, 21, then, depict, the, depolarization, as, it, travels, throughout, both, ventricles, from, the, apex, of, the, heart, following, the, action, potential, in, the, purkinje, fibers, this, phenomenon, creates, a, negative, deflection, in, all, three, limb, leads, forming, the, s, wave, on, the, ecg, repolarization, of, the, atria, occurs, at, the, same, time, as, the, generation, of, the, qrs, complex, but, it, is, not, detected, by, the, ecg, since, the, tissue, mass, of, the, ventricles, is, so, much, larger, than, that, of, the, atria, ventricular, contraction, occurs, between, ventricular, depolarization, and, repolarization, during, this, time, there, is, no, movement, of, charge, so, no, deflection, is, created, on, the, ecg, this, results, in, the, flat, st, segment, after, the, s, wave, frames, 24, 28, in, the, animation, depict, repolarization, of, the, ventricles, the, epicardium, is, the, first, layer, of, the, ventricles, to, repolarize, followed, by, the, myocardium, the, endocardium, is, the, last, layer, to, repolarize, the, plateau, phase, of, depolarization, has, been, shown, to, last, longer, in, endocardial, cells, than, in, epicardial, cells, this, causes, repolarization, to, start, from, the, apex, of, the, heart, and, move, upwards, since, repolarization, is, the, spread, of, negative, current, as, membrane, potentials, decrease, back, down, to, the, resting, membrane, potential, the, red, arrow, in, the, animation, is, pointing, in, the, direction, opposite, of, the, repolarization, this, therefore, creates, a, positive, deflection, in, the, ecg, and, creates, the, t, wave, ischemia, or, non, st, elevation, myocardial, infarctions, non, stemis, may, manifest, as, st, depression, or, inversion, of, t, waves, it, may, also, affect, the, high, frequency, band, of, the, qrs, st, elevation, myocardial, infarctions, stemis, have, different, characteristic, ecg, findings, based, on, the, amount, of, time, elapsed, since, the, mi, first, occurred, the, earliest, sign, is, hyperacute, t, waves, peaked, t, waves, due, to, local, hyperkalemia, in, ischemic, myocardium, this, then, progresses, over, a, period, of, minutes, to, elevations, of, the, st, segment, by, at, least, 1, mm, over, a, period, of, hours, a, pathologic, q, wave, may, appear, and, the, t, wave, will, invert, over, a, period, of, days, the, st, elevation, will, resolve, pathologic, q, waves, generally, will, remain, permanently, the, coronary, artery, that, has, been, occluded, can, be, identified, in, an, stemi, based, on, the, location, of, st, elevation, the, left, anterior, descending, lad, artery, supplies, the, anterior, wall, of, the, heart, and, therefore, causes, st, elevations, in, anterior, leads, v, 1, and, v, 2, the, lcx, supplies, the, lateral, aspect, of, the, heart, and, therefore, causes, st, elevations, in, lateral, leads, i, avl, and, v, 6, the, right, coronary, artery, rca, usually, supplies, the, inferior, aspect, of, the, heart, and, therefore, causes, st, elevations, in, inferior, leads, ii, iii, and, avf, an, ecg, tracing, is, affected, by, patient, motion, some, rhythmic, motions, such, as, shivering, or, tremors, can, create, the, illusion, of, cardiac, arrhythmia, artifacts, are, distorted, signals, caused, by, a, secondary, internal, or, external, sources, such, as, muscle, movement, or, interference, from, an, electrical, device, distortion, poses, significant, challenges, to, healthcare, providers, who, employ, various, techniques, and, strategies, to, safely, recognize, these, false, signals, accurately, separating, the, ecg, artifact, from, the, true, ecg, signal, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, patient, outcomes, and, legal, liabilities, improper, lead, placement, for, example, reversing, two, of, the, limb, leads, has, been, estimated, to, occur, in, 0, 4, to, 4, of, all, ecg, recordings, and, has, resulted, in, improper, diagnosis, and, treatment, including, unnecessary, use, of, thrombolytic, therapy, whitbread, consultant, nurse, and, paramedic, suggests, ten, rules, of, the, normal, ecg, deviation, from, which, is, likely, to, indicate, pathology, these, have, been, added, to, creating, the, 15, rules, for, 12, lead, and, 15, or, 18, lead, interpretation, rule, 1, all, waves, in, avr, are, negative, rule, 2, the, st, segment, j, point, starts, on, the, isoelectric, line, except, in, v1, v2, where, it, may, be, elevated, by, not, greater, than, 1, mm, rule, 3, the, pr, interval, should, be, 0, 12, 0, 2, seconds, long, rule, 4, the, qrs, complex, should, not, exceed, 0, 11, 0, 12, seconds, rule, 5, the, qrs, and, t, waves, tend, to, have, the, same, general, direction, in, the, limb, leads, rule, 6, the, r, wave, in, the, precordial, chest, leads, grows, from, v1, to, at, least, v4, where, it, may, or, may, not, decline, again, rule, 7, the, qrs, is, mainly, upright, in, i, and, ii, rule, 8, the, p, wave, is, upright, in, i, ii, and, v2, to, v6, rule, 9, there, is, no, q, wave, or, only, a, small, q, 0, 04, seconds, in, width, in, i, ii, and, v2, to, v6, rule, 10, the, t, wave, is, upright, in, i, ii, and, v2, to, v6, the, end, of, the, t, wave, should, not, drop, below, the, isoelectric, baseline, rule, 11, does, the, deepest, s, wave, in, v1, plus, the, tallest, r, wave, in, v5, or, v6, equal, 35, mm, rule, 12, is, there, an, epsilon, wave, rule, 13, is, there, an, j, wave, rule, 14, is, there, a, delta, wave, rule, 15, are, there, any, patterns, representing, an, occlusive, myocardial, infarction, omi, numerous, diagnoses, and, findings, can, be, made, based, upon, electrocardiography, and, many, are, discussed, above, overall, the, diagnoses, are, made, based, on, the, patterns, for, example, an, irregularly, irregular, qrs, complex, without, p, waves, is, the, hallmark, of, atrial, fibrillation, however, other, findings, can, be, present, as, well, such, as, a, bundle, branch, block, that, alters, the, shape, of, the, qrs, complexes, ecgs, can, be, interpreted, in, isolation, but, should, be, applied, like, all, diagnostic, tests, in, the, context, of, the, patient, for, example, an, observation, of, peaked, t, waves, is, not, sufficient, to, diagnose, hyperkalemia, such, a, diagnosis, should, be, verified, by, measuring, the, blood, potassium, level, conversely, a, discovery, of, hyperkalemia, should, be, followed, by, an, ecg, for, manifestations, such, as, peaked, t, waves, widened, qrs, complexes, and, loss, of, p, waves, the, following, is, an, organized, list, of, possible, ecg, based, diagnoses, rhythm, disturbances, or, arrhythmias, heart, block, and, conduction, problems, electrolytes, disturbances, and, intoxication, ischemia, and, infarction, structural, other, phenomena, the, word, is, derived, from, the, greek, electro, meaning, related, to, electrical, activity, kardia, meaning, heart, and, graph, meaning, to, write
