a, thread, is, a, long, strand, of, material, often, composed, of, several, filaments, or, fibres, used, for, joining, creating, or, decorating, textiles, ancient, egyptians, were, known, for, creating, thread, using, plant, fibers, wool, and, hair, today, thread, can, also, be, made, of, many, different, materials, including, but, not, limited, to, cotton, wool, flax, nylon, silk, polyester, etc, there, are, also, metal, threads, sometimes, used, in, decorative, textiles, which, can, be, made, of, fine, wire, thread, is, similar, to, yarn, cord, twine, or, string, and, there, is, some, overlap, between, the, way, these, terms, are, used, however, thread, is, most, often, used, to, mean, materials, fine, and, smooth, enough, for, sewing, embroidery, weaving, or, making, lace, or, net, yarn, is, often, used, to, mean, a, thicker, and, softer, material, suitable, for, knitting, and, crochet, cords, twines, or, strings, are, usually, stronger, materials, suitable, for, tying, and, fastening, thread, is, made, from, a, wide, variety, of, materials, where, a, thread, is, stronger, than, the, material, that, it, is, being, used, to, join, if, seams, are, placed, under, strain, the, material, may, tear, before, the, thread, breaks, garments, are, usually, sewn, with, threads, of, lesser, strength, than, the, fabric, so, that, if, stressed, the, seam, will, break, before, the, garment, heavy, goods, that, must, withstand, considerable, stresses, such, as, upholstery, car, seating, tarpaulins, tents, and, saddlery, require, very, strong, threads, attempting, repairs, with, light, weight, thread, will, usually, result, in, rapid, failure, though, again, using, a, thread, that, is, stronger, than, the, material, being, sewn, can, end, up, causing, rips, in, that, material, before, the, thread, itself, gives, way, polyester, polyester, core, spun, thread, is, made, by, wrapping, staple, polyester, around, a, continuous, polyester, filament, during, spinning, and, plying, these, yarns, into, a, sewing, thread, yarns, are, measured, by, the, density, of, the, yarn, which, is, described, by, various, units, of, textile, measurement, relating, to, a, standardized, length, per, weight, these, units, do, not, directly, correspond, to, thread, diameter, the, most, common, weight, system, for, thread, specifies, the, length, of, the, thread, in, kilometres, required, to, weigh, 1, kilogram, therefore, a, greater, weight, number, indicated, in, the, american, standard, by, the, abbreviation, wt, indicates, a, thinner, finer, thread, the, american, standard, of, thread, weight, was, adopted, from, the, gunze, count, standard, of, japan, which, uses, two, numbers, separated, by, a, forward, slash, the, first, number, corresponds, to, the, wt, number, of, the, thread, and, the, second, number, indicates, how, many, strands, of, fiber, were, used, to, compose, the, finished, thread, it, is, common, to, wrap, three, strands, of, the, same, weight, to, make, one, thread, though, this, is, not, a, formal, requirement, in, the, us, standard, which, is, therefore, less, informative, a, denier, weight, specification, states, how, many, grams, 9, 000, metres, of, the, thread, weighs, unlike, the, common, thread, weight, system, the, greater, the, denier, number, the, thicker, the, thread, the, denier, weight, system, like, the, common, weight, system, also, specifies, the, number, of, strands, of, the, specified, weight, which, were, wrapped, together, to, make, the, finished, thread, only, embroidery, threads, have, their, weights, given, in, denier, tex, is, the, mass, in, grams, of, 1, 000, metres, of, thread, if, 1, 000, m, weighs, 25, g, it, is, a, tex, 25, larger, tex, numbers, are, heavier, threads, tex, is, used, throughout, north, america, and, europe, manufacturers, producing, fine, silk, threads, apply, their, own, scales, of, thread, measurement, using, aughts, or, zeroes, at, the, finest, end, and, fff, at, the, other, thus, scaling, 000, 00, 0, a, b, c, d, e, f, ff, fff, the, three, finest, threads, are, described, as, having, three, aughts, two, aughts, and, one, aught, respectively, and, as, having, different, aught, counts, within, a, given, manufacturer, s, spectrum, a, higher, aught, count, indicates, a, finer, thread, this, may, be, given, as, a, single, digit, followed, by, a, forward, slash, and, a, zero, for, example, 3, 0, indicates, a, three, aught, thread, or, a, thread, size, 000, but, this, number, only, has, significance, when, compared, to, other, threads, produced, by, the, same, manufacturer, one, manufacturer, s, 3, 0, will, always, be, more, fine, than, that, same, manufacturer, s, 2, 0, but, may, not, be, comparable, to, the, 3, 0, of, another, manufacturer, very, roughly, however, size, a, is, 900, yards, per, pound, of, thread, and, every, 100, yards, difference, is, one, letter, size, different, the, size, is, always, given, for, the, overall, thread, not, its, individual, silk, plies, some, heavier, duty, threads, are, given, commercial, size, designations, in, set, sizes, of, 30, 46, 69, 92, 138, 207, 277, 346, 415, and, 554, only, each, of, these, numbers, is, merely, the, thread, s, denier, size, divided, by, 10, a, commercial, size, 138, thread, has, a, denier, of, 1380, thread, weight, conversion, table, for, example, 40, weight, 225, denier, tex, 25, commercial, 27, 8, a, common, tex, number, for, general, sewing, thread, is, tex, 25, or, tex, 30, a, slightly, heavier, silk, buttonhole, thread, suitable, for, bartacking, small, leather, items, and, decorative, seams, might, be, tex, 40, a, strong, durable, upholstery, thread, tex, 75, a, heavy, duty, topstitching, thread, for, coats, bags, and, shoes, tex, 100, a, very, strong, topstitching, thread, suitable, for, luggage, and, tarpaulins, tex, 265, tex, 290, but, a, fine, serging, thread, is, only, tex, 13, and, blindstitching, and, felling, machines, an, even, finer, tex, 8, threads, of, different, composition, and, construction, may, be, labeled, in, a, variety, of, ways, most, threads, are, composed, of, 2, or, more, plies, of, fiber, and, this, information, is, often, provided, on, thread, packaging, along, with, the, finalized, thread, s, weight, according, to, a, particular, scale, of, measurement, the, actual, physical, diameter, of, a, thread, is, not, recorded, and, is, unhelpful, spools, may, have, codes, that, indicate, their, fiber, content, as, well, such, a, p, for, polyester, if, a, fiber, content, is, given, in, the, label, code, it, will, be, the, first, piece, if, information, located, there, sometimes, a, manufacturer, does, not, provide, any, weight, specification, at, all, on, its, spools, and, instead, provides, only, the, fiber, content, and, spool, length, such, as, 100, silk, 250, m, this, means, only, that, the, spool, has, 250, meters, of, pure, silk, but, does, not, indicate, how, many, plies, make, up, that, thread, nor, what, the, plies, or, the, combined, thread, s, weight, is, the, cotton, count, system, is, based, on, the, number, of, 840, yard, hanks, that, will, result, from, a, single, pound, of, a, particular, finished, thread, this, is, the, non, metric, equivalent, of, the, gunze, count, and, is, given, with, two, numbers, separated, by, a, slash, the, first, is, the, size, of, the, thread, and, the, second, is, the, number, of, plies, of, that, size, used, in, the, finished, thread, the, cotton, count, was, developed, for, the, cotton, industry, but, cotton, counts, are, also, frequently, given, for, polyester, and, polyester, cotton, blends, as, well, a, hong, kong, ticket, number, when, present, is, a, cotton, count, number, without, the, slash, and, with, the, final, number, always, indicating, the, number, of, plies, if, more, than, one, a, hong, kong, ticket, number, of, 1002, is, made, of, two, plies, of, size, 100, thread, a, number, of, 100, is, made, of, a, single, ply, of, size, 100, thread, a, size, 503, is, made, of, three, plies, of, size, 50, thread, a, spool, of, thread, may, be, described, in, terms, of, its, single, s, equivalent, this, is, the, cotton, count, size, of, the, thread, divided, by, the, number, of, plies, which, make, it, up, a, spool, of, 30, 3, thread, has, a, single, s, equivalent, of, 10, because, a, single, strand, or, ply, of, that, thread, has, a, cotton, count, size, of, 10, a, 20, 2, spool, has, the, same, single, s, equivalent, as, a, 30, 3, but, a, 30, 2, spool, has, a, single, s, equivalent, of, 15, which, means, it, is, composed, of, individually, heavier, plies, than, a, 30, 3, high, temperature, sewing, threads, provide, durability, and, resistance, to, extreme, temperatures, some, threads, can, be, used, for, applications, up, to, 800, c, 1472, f, there, are, a, variety, of, different, sewing, threads, available, which, have, different, applications, and, benefits, kevlar, coated, stainless, steel, sewing, threads, have, a, high, temperature, and, flame, resistant, steel, core, combined, with, kevlar, coating, designed, to, facilitate, easier, machine, sewing, the, stainless, steel, core, has, a, temperature, resistance, of, up, to, 800, c, 1472, f, and, the, kevlar, coating, is, heat, resistant, up, to, 220, c, 428, f, ptfe, coated, glass, sewing, threads, have, an, excellent, temperature, resistance, combined, with, a, ptfe, coating, to, provide, easier, machine, sewing, the, glass, core, has, a, temperature, resistance, of, up, to, 550, c, 1022, f, and, the, ptfe, coating, is, heat, resistant, up, to, 230, c, 446, f, nomex, sewing, threads, are, inherently, flame, retardant, and, heat, resistant, with, a, tough, protective, coating, that, resists, abrasion, during, the, sewing, operation, it, is, temperature, resistant, up, to, 370, c, 698, f, bonded, nylon, sewing, threads, are, tough, coated, with, abrasion, resistance, rot, proofing, and, have, good, tensile, strength, for, lower, temperature, applications, they, are, temperature, resistant, up, to, 120, c, 248, f, bonded, polyester, sewing, threads, are, tough, coated, with, abrasion, resistance, rot, proofing, and, have, exceptional, tensile, strength, for, lower, temperatures, but, heavier, duty, sewing, operations, they, are, temperature, resistant, up, to, 120, c, 248, f
