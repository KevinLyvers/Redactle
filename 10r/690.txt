a, train, station, railroad, station, or, railroad, depot, mainly, north, american, terminology, and, railway, station, mainly, uk, and, other, anglophone, countries, is, a, railway, facility, where, trains, stop, to, load, or, unload, passengers, freight, or, both, it, generally, consists, of, at, least, one, platform, one, track, and, a, station, building, providing, such, ancillary, services, as, ticket, sales, waiting, rooms, and, baggage, freight, service, stations, on, a, single, track, line, often, have, a, passing, loop, to, accommodate, trains, travelling, in, the, opposite, direction, locations, at, which, passengers, only, occasionally, board, or, leave, a, train, sometimes, consisting, of, a, short, platform, and, a, waiting, area, but, sometimes, indicated, by, no, more, than, a, sign, are, variously, referred, to, as, stops, flag, stops, halts, or, provisional, stopping, places, the, stations, themselves, may, be, at, ground, level, underground, or, elevated, connections, may, be, available, to, intersecting, rail, lines, or, other, transport, modes, such, as, buses, trams, or, other, rapid, transit, systems, train, station, is, the, terminology, typically, used, in, the, u, s, in, europe, the, terms, train, station, and, railway, station, are, both, commonly, used, with, railroad, being, obsolete, in, british, commonwealth, nations, usage, where, railway, station, is, the, traditional, term, the, word, station, is, commonly, understood, to, mean, a, railway, station, unless, otherwise, specified, in, the, united, states, the, term, depot, is, sometimes, used, as, an, alternative, name, for, station, along, with, the, compound, forms, train, depot, railway, depot, and, railroad, depot, it, is, used, for, both, passenger, and, freight, facilities, the, term, depot, is, not, used, in, reference, to, vehicle, maintenance, facilities, in, the, u, s, whereas, it, is, used, as, such, in, canada, and, the, united, kingdom, the, world, s, first, recorded, railway, station, for, trains, drawn, by, horses, rather, than, engined, locomotives, began, passenger, service, in, 1807, it, was, the, mount, in, swansea, wales, on, the, oystermouth, later, the, swansea, and, mumbles, railway, the, world, s, oldest, station, for, engined, trains, was, at, heighington, on, the, stockton, and, darlington, railway, in, north, east, england, built, by, george, stephenson, in, the, early, 19th, century, operated, by, locomotive, locomotion, no, 1, the, station, opened, in, 1827, and, was, in, use, until, the, 1970s, the, building, grade, ii, listed, was, in, bad, condition, but, was, restored, in, 1984, as, an, inn, the, inn, closed, in, 2017, in, 2024, there, were, plans, to, renovate, the, derelict, station, in, time, for, the, 200th, anniversary, of, the, opening, of, the, railway, line, the, two, storey, mount, clare, station, in, baltimore, maryland, united, states, which, survives, as, a, museum, first, saw, passenger, service, as, the, terminus, of, the, horse, drawn, baltimore, and, ohio, railroad, on, 22, may, 1830, the, oldest, terminal, station, in, the, world, was, crown, street, railway, station, in, liverpool, england, built, in, 1830, on, the, locomotive, hauled, liverpool, to, manchester, line, the, station, was, slightly, older, than, the, still, extant, liverpool, road, railway, station, terminal, in, manchester, the, station, was, the, first, to, incorporate, a, train, shed, crown, street, station, was, demolished, in, 1836, as, the, liverpool, terminal, station, moved, to, lime, street, railway, station, crown, street, station, was, converted, to, a, goods, station, terminal, the, first, stations, had, little, in, the, way, of, buildings, or, amenities, the, first, stations, in, the, modern, sense, were, on, the, liverpool, and, manchester, railway, opened, in, 1830, manchester, s, liverpool, road, station, the, second, oldest, terminal, station, in, the, world, is, preserved, as, part, of, the, museum, of, science, and, industry, in, manchester, it, resembles, a, row, of, georgian, houses, early, stations, were, sometimes, built, with, both, passenger, and, freight, facilities, though, some, railway, lines, were, goods, only, or, passenger, only, and, if, a, line, was, dual, purpose, there, would, often, be, a, freight, depot, apart, from, the, passenger, station, this, type, of, dual, purpose, station, can, sometimes, still, be, found, today, though, in, many, cases, goods, facilities, are, restricted, to, major, stations, many, stations, date, from, the, 19th, century, and, reflect, the, grandiose, architecture, of, the, time, lending, prestige, to, the, city, as, well, as, to, railway, operations, countries, where, railways, arrived, later, may, still, have, such, architecture, as, later, stations, often, imitated, 19th, century, styles, various, forms, of, architecture, have, been, used, in, the, construction, of, stations, from, those, boasting, grand, intricate, baroque, or, gothic, style, edifices, to, plainer, utilitarian, or, modernist, styles, stations, in, europe, tended, to, follow, british, designs, and, were, in, some, countries, like, italy, financed, by, british, railway, companies, train, stations, built, more, recently, often, have, a, similar, feel, to, airports, with, a, simple, abstract, style, examples, of, modern, stations, include, those, on, newer, high, speed, rail, networks, such, as, the, shinkansen, in, japan, thsr, in, taiwan, tgv, lines, in, france, and, ice, lines, in, germany, stations, normally, have, staffed, ticket, sales, offices, automated, ticket, machines, or, both, although, on, some, lines, tickets, are, sold, on, board, the, trains, many, stations, include, a, shop, or, convenience, store, larger, stations, usually, have, fast, food, or, restaurant, facilities, in, some, countries, stations, may, also, have, a, bar, or, pub, other, station, facilities, may, include, toilets, left, luggage, lost, and, found, departures, and, arrivals, schedules, luggage, carts, waiting, rooms, taxi, ranks, bus, bays, and, even, car, parks, larger, or, staffed, stations, tend, to, have, a, greater, range, of, facilities, including, also, a, station, security, office, these, are, usually, open, for, travellers, when, there, is, sufficient, traffic, over, a, long, enough, period, of, time, to, warrant, the, cost, in, large, cities, this, may, mean, facilities, available, around, the, clock, a, basic, station, might, only, have, platforms, though, it, may, still, be, distinguished, from, a, halt, a, stopping, or, halting, place, that, may, not, even, have, platforms, many, stations, either, larger, or, smaller, offer, interchange, with, local, transportation, this, can, vary, from, a, simple, bus, stop, across, the, street, to, underground, rapid, transit, urban, rail, stations, in, many, african, south, american, and, asian, countries, stations, are, also, used, as, a, place, for, public, markets, and, other, informal, businesses, this, is, especially, true, on, tourist, routes, or, stations, near, tourist, destinations, as, well, as, providing, services, for, passengers, and, loading, facilities, for, goods, stations, can, sometimes, have, locomotive, and, rolling, stock, depots, usually, with, facilities, for, storing, and, refuelling, rolling, stock, and, carrying, out, minor, repairs, the, basic, configuration, of, a, station, and, various, other, features, set, certain, types, apart, the, first, is, the, level, of, the, tracks, stations, are, often, sited, where, a, road, crosses, the, railway, unless, the, crossing, is, a, level, crossing, the, road, and, railway, will, be, at, different, levels, the, platforms, will, often, be, raised, or, lowered, relative, to, the, station, entrance, the, station, buildings, may, be, on, either, level, or, both, the, other, arrangement, where, the, station, entrance, and, platforms, are, on, the, same, level, is, also, common, but, is, perhaps, rarer, in, urban, areas, except, when, the, station, is, a, terminus, stations, located, at, level, crossings, can, be, problematic, if, the, train, blocks, the, roadway, while, it, stops, causing, road, traffic, to, wait, for, an, extended, period, of, time, stations, also, exist, where, the, station, buildings, are, above, the, tracks, an, example, of, this, is, arbroath, occasionally, a, station, serves, two, or, more, railway, lines, at, differing, levels, this, may, be, due, to, the, station, s, position, at, a, point, where, two, lines, cross, example, berlin, hauptbahnhof, or, may, be, to, provide, separate, station, capacity, for, two, types, of, service, such, as, intercity, and, suburban, examples, paris, gare, de, lyon, and, philadelphia, s, 30th, street, station, or, for, two, different, destinations, stations, may, also, be, classified, according, to, the, layout, of, the, platforms, apart, from, single, track, lines, the, most, basic, arrangement, is, a, pair, of, tracks, for, the, two, directions, there, is, then, a, basic, choice, of, an, island, platform, between, two, separate, platforms, outside, the, tracks, side, platforms, or, a, combination, of, the, two, with, more, tracks, the, possibilities, expand, some, stations, have, unusual, platform, layouts, due, to, space, constraints, of, the, station, location, or, the, alignment, of, the, tracks, examples, include, staggered, platforms, such, as, at, tutbury, and, hatton, railway, station, on, the, crewe, derby, line, and, curved, platforms, such, as, cheadle, hulme, railway, station, on, the, macclesfield, to, manchester, line, stations, at, junctions, can, also, have, unusual, shapes, a, keilbahnhof, or, wedge, shaped, station, is, sited, where, two, lines, split, triangular, stations, also, exist, where, two, lines, form, a, three, way, junction, and, platforms, are, built, on, all, three, sides, for, example, shipley, and, earlestown, stations, in, a, station, there, are, different, types, of, tracks, to, serve, different, purposes, a, station, may, also, have, a, passing, loop, with, a, loop, line, that, comes, off, the, straight, main, line, and, merge, back, to, the, main, line, on, the, other, end, by, railroad, switches, to, allow, trains, to, pass, a, track, with, a, spot, at, the, station, to, board, and, disembark, trains, is, called, station, track, or, house, track, regardless, of, whether, it, is, a, main, line, or, loop, line, if, such, track, is, served, by, a, platform, the, track, may, be, called, platform, track, a, loop, line, without, a, platform, which, is, used, to, allow, a, train, to, clear, the, main, line, at, the, station, only, is, called, passing, track, a, track, at, the, station, without, a, platform, which, is, used, for, trains, to, pass, the, station, without, stopping, is, called, through, track, there, may, be, other, sidings, at, the, station, which, are, lower, speed, tracks, for, other, purposes, a, maintenance, track, or, a, maintenance, siding, usually, connected, to, a, passing, track, is, used, for, parking, maintenance, equipment, trains, not, in, service, autoracks, or, sleepers, a, refuge, track, is, a, dead, end, siding, that, is, connected, to, a, station, track, as, a, temporary, storage, of, a, disabled, train, a, terminus, or, terminal, is, a, station, at, the, end, of, a, railway, line, trains, arriving, there, have, to, end, their, journeys, terminate, or, reverse, out, of, the, station, depending, on, the, layout, of, the, station, this, usually, permits, travellers, to, reach, all, the, platforms, without, the, need, to, cross, any, tracks, the, public, entrance, to, the, station, and, the, main, reception, facilities, being, at, the, far, end, of, the, platforms, sometimes, the, track, continues, for, a, short, distance, beyond, the, station, and, terminating, trains, continue, forward, after, depositing, their, passengers, before, either, proceeding, to, sidings, or, reversing, to, the, station, to, pick, up, departing, passengers, bondi, junction, australia, and, kristiansand, station, norway, are, examples, a, terminus, is, frequently, but, not, always, the, final, destination, of, trains, arriving, at, the, station, especially, in, continental, europe, a, city, may, have, a, terminus, as, its, main, railway, station, and, all, main, lines, converge, on, it, in, such, cases, all, trains, arriving, at, the, terminus, must, leave, in, the, reverse, direction, from, that, of, their, arrival, there, are, several, ways, in, which, this, can, be, accomplished, there, may, also, be, a, bypass, line, used, by, freight, trains, that, do, not, need, to, stop, at, the, terminus, some, termini, have, a, newer, set, of, through, platforms, underneath, or, above, or, alongside, the, terminal, platforms, on, the, main, level, they, are, used, by, a, cross, city, extension, of, the, main, line, often, for, commuter, trains, while, the, terminal, platforms, may, serve, long, distance, services, examples, of, underground, through, lines, include, the, thameslink, platforms, at, st, pancras, in, london, the, argyle, and, north, clyde, lines, of, glasgow, s, suburban, rail, network, in, antwerp, in, belgium, the, rer, at, the, gare, du, nord, in, paris, the, milan, suburban, railway, service, s, passante, railway, and, many, of, the, numerous, s, bahn, lines, at, terminal, stations, in, germany, austria, and, switzerland, such, as, at, z, rich, hauptbahnhof, due, to, the, disadvantages, of, terminus, stations, there, have, been, multiple, cases, in, which, one, or, several, terminus, stations, were, replaced, with, a, new, through, station, including, the, cases, of, berlin, hauptbahnhof, vienna, hauptbahnhof, and, numerous, examples, throughout, the, first, century, of, railroading, stuttgart, 21, is, a, controversial, project, involving, the, replacement, of, a, terminus, station, by, a, through, station, an, american, example, of, a, terminal, with, this, feature, is, union, station, in, washington, dc, where, there, are, bay, platforms, on, the, main, concourse, level, to, serve, terminating, trains, and, standard, island, platforms, one, level, below, to, serve, trains, continuing, southward, the, lower, tracks, run, in, a, tunnel, beneath, the, concourse, and, emerge, a, few, blocks, away, to, cross, the, potomac, river, into, virginia, terminus, stations, in, large, cities, are, by, far, the, biggest, stations, with, the, largest, being, grand, central, terminal, in, new, york, city, other, major, cities, such, as, london, boston, paris, istanbul, tokyo, and, milan, have, more, than, one, terminus, rather, than, routes, straight, through, the, city, train, journeys, through, such, cities, often, require, alternative, transport, metro, bus, taxi, or, ferry, from, one, terminus, to, the, other, for, instance, in, istanbul, transfers, from, the, sirkeci, terminal, the, european, terminus, and, the, haydarpa, a, terminal, the, asian, terminus, historically, required, crossing, the, bosphorus, via, alternative, means, before, the, marmaray, railway, tunnel, linking, europe, and, asia, was, completed, some, cities, including, new, york, have, both, termini, and, through, lines, terminals, that, have, competing, rail, lines, using, the, station, frequently, set, up, a, jointly, owned, terminal, railroad, to, own, and, operate, the, station, and, its, associated, tracks, and, switching, operations, during, a, journey, the, term, station, stop, may, be, used, in, announcements, to, differentiate, a, halt, during, which, passengers, may, alight, for, another, reason, such, as, a, locomotive, change, while, a, junction, or, interlocking, usually, divides, two, or, more, lines, or, routes, and, thus, has, remotely, or, locally, operated, signals, a, station, stop, does, not, a, station, stop, usually, does, not, have, any, tracks, other, than, the, main, tracks, and, may, or, may, not, have, switches, points, crossovers, an, intermediate, station, does, not, have, any, other, connecting, route, unlike, branch, off, stations, connecting, stations, transfer, stations, and, railway, junctions, in, a, broader, sense, an, intermediate, station, is, generally, any, station, on, the, route, between, its, two, terminal, stations, the, majority, of, stations, are, in, practice, intermediate, stations, they, are, mostly, designed, as, through, stations, there, are, only, a, few, intermediate, stations, that, take, the, form, of, a, stub, end, station, for, example, at, some, zigzags, if, there, is, a, station, building, it, is, usually, located, to, the, side, of, the, tracks, in, the, case, of, intermediate, stations, used, for, both, passenger, and, freight, traffic, there, is, a, distinction, between, those, where, the, station, building, and, goods, facilities, are, on, the, same, side, of, the, tracks, and, those, in, which, the, goods, facilities, are, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, tracks, from, the, station, building, intermediate, stations, also, occur, on, some, funicular, and, cable, car, routes, a, halt, in, railway, parlance, in, the, commonwealth, of, nations, ireland, and, portugal, is, a, small, station, usually, unstaffed, or, with, very, few, staff, and, with, few, or, no, facilities, in, some, cases, trains, stop, only, on, request, when, passengers, on, the, platform, indicate, that, they, wish, to, board, or, passengers, on, the, train, inform, the, crew, that, they, wish, to, alight, these, can, sometimes, appear, with, signals, and, sometimes, without, the, great, western, railway, in, great, britain, began, opening, haltes, on, 12, october, 1903, from, 1905, the, french, spelling, was, anglicised, to, halt, these, gwr, halts, had, the, most, basic, facilities, with, platforms, long, enough, for, just, one, or, two, carriages, some, had, no, raised, platform, at, all, necessitating, the, provision, of, steps, on, the, carriages, halts, were, normally, unstaffed, tickets, being, sold, on, the, train, on, 1, september, 1904, a, larger, version, known, on, the, gwr, as, a, platform, instead, of, a, halt, was, introduced, these, had, longer, platforms, and, were, usually, staffed, by, a, senior, grade, porter, who, sold, tickets, and, sometimes, booked, parcels, or, milk, consignments, from, 1903, to, 1947, the, gwr, built, 379, halts, and, inherited, a, further, 40, from, other, companies, at, the, grouping, of, 1923, peak, building, periods, were, before, the, first, world, war, 145, built, and, 1928, 1939, 198, built, ten, more, were, opened, by, british, rail, on, ex, gwr, lines, the, gwr, also, built, 34, platforms, many, such, stops, remain, on, the, national, railway, networks, in, the, united, kingdom, such, as, penmaenmawr, in, north, wales, yorton, in, shropshire, and, the, lakes, in, warwickshire, where, passengers, are, requested, to, inform, a, member, of, on, board, train, staff, if, they, wish, to, alight, or, if, catching, a, train, from, the, station, to, make, themselves, clearly, visible, to, the, driver, and, use, a, hand, signal, as, the, train, approaches, most, have, had, halt, removed, from, their, names, two, publicly, advertised, and, publicly, accessible, national, rail, stations, retain, it, coombe, junction, halt, and, st, keyne, wishing, well, halt, a, number, of, other, halts, are, still, open, and, operational, on, privately, owned, heritage, and, preserved, railways, throughout, the, british, isles, the, word, is, often, used, informally, to, describe, national, rail, network, stations, with, limited, service, and, low, usage, such, as, the, oxfordshire, halts, on, the, cotswold, line, it, has, also, sometimes, been, used, for, stations, served, by, public, services, but, accessible, only, by, persons, travelling, to, from, an, associated, factory, for, example, ibm, near, greenock, and, british, steel, redcar, although, neither, of, these, is, any, longer, served, by, trains, or, military, base, such, as, lympstone, commando, or, railway, yard, the, only, two, such, private, stopping, places, on, the, national, system, where, the, halt, designation, is, still, officially, used, seem, to, be, staff, halt, at, durnsford, road, wimbledon, and, battersea, pier, sidings, staff, halt, both, of, which, are, solely, for, railway, staff, in, portugal, railway, stops, are, called, halts, portuguese, apeadeiro, in, ireland, a, few, small, railway, stations, are, designated, as, halts, irish, stadanna, sing, stad, in, some, commonwealth, countries, the, term, halt, is, used, in, australia, with, its, sparse, rural, populations, such, stopping, places, were, common, on, lines, that, were, still, open, for, passenger, traffic, in, the, state, of, victoria, for, example, a, location, on, a, railway, line, where, a, small, diesel, railcar, or, railmotor, could, stop, on, request, allowing, passengers, to, board, or, alight, was, called, a, rail, motor, stopping, place, rmsp, usually, situated, near, a, level, crossing, it, was, often, designated, solely, by, a, sign, beside, the, railway, the, passenger, could, hail, the, driver, to, stop, and, could, buy, a, ticket, from, the, train, guard, or, conductor, in, south, australia, such, facilities, were, called, provisional, stopping, places, they, were, often, placed, on, routes, on, which, school, trains, services, conveying, children, from, rural, localities, to, and, from, school, operated, in, west, malaysia, halts, are, commonplace, along, the, less, developed, ktm, east, coast, railway, line, to, serve, rural, kampongs, villages, that, require, train, services, to, stay, connected, to, important, nodes, but, do, not, have, a, need, for, staff, people, boarding, at, halts, who, have, not, bought, tickets, online, can, buy, it, through, staff, on, board, in, rural, and, remote, communities, across, canada, and, the, united, states, passengers, wanting, to, board, the, train, at, such, places, had, to, flag, the, train, down, to, stop, it, hence, the, name, flag, stops, or, flag, stations, accessibility, for, disabled, people, is, mandated, by, law, in, some, countries, considerations, include, in, the, united, kingdom, rail, operators, will, arrange, alternative, transport, typically, a, taxi, at, no, extra, cost, to, the, ticket, holder, if, the, station, they, intend, to, travel, to, or, from, is, inaccessible, goods, or, freight, stations, deal, exclusively, or, predominantly, with, the, loading, and, unloading, of, goods, and, may, well, have, marshalling, yards, classification, yards, for, the, sorting, of, wagons, the, world, s, first, goods, terminal, was, the, 1830, park, lane, goods, station, at, the, south, end, liverpool, docks, built, in, 1830, the, terminal, was, reached, by, a, 1, 24, mile, 2, km, tunnel, as, goods, are, increasingly, moved, by, road, many, former, goods, stations, as, well, as, the, goods, sheds, at, passenger, stations, have, closed, many, are, used, purely, for, the, cross, loading, of, freight, and, may, be, known, as, transshipment, stations, where, they, primarily, handle, containers, they, are, also, known, as, container, stations, or, terminals, busiest, largest, highest
