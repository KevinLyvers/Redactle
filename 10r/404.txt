a, plough, or, us, plow, both, pronounced, p, l, a, is, a, farm, tool, for, loosening, or, turning, the, soil, before, sowing, seed, or, planting, ploughs, were, traditionally, drawn, by, oxen, and, horses, but, in, modern, farms, are, drawn, by, tractors, a, plough, may, have, a, wooden, iron, or, steel, frame, with, a, blade, attached, to, cut, and, loosen, the, soil, it, has, been, fundamental, to, farming, for, most, of, history, the, earliest, ploughs, had, no, wheels, such, a, plough, was, known, to, the, romans, as, an, aratrum, celtic, peoples, first, came, to, use, wheeled, ploughs, in, the, roman, era, the, prime, purpose, of, ploughing, is, to, turn, over, the, uppermost, soil, bringing, fresh, nutrients, to, the, surface, while, burying, weeds, and, crop, remains, to, decay, trenches, cut, by, the, plough, are, called, furrows, in, modern, use, a, ploughed, field, is, normally, left, to, dry, and, then, harrowed, before, planting, ploughing, and, cultivating, soil, evens, the, content, of, the, upper, 12, to, 25, centimetres, 5, to, 10, in, layer, of, soil, where, most, plant, feeder, roots, grow, ploughs, were, initially, powered, by, humans, but, the, use, of, farm, animals, is, considerably, more, efficient, the, earliest, animals, worked, were, oxen, later, horses, and, mules, were, used, in, many, areas, with, the, industrial, revolution, came, the, possibility, of, steam, engines, to, pull, ploughs, these, in, turn, were, superseded, by, internal, combustion, powered, tractors, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, petty, plough, was, a, notable, invention, for, ploughing, out, orchard, strips, in, australia, in, the, 1930s, use, of, the, traditional, plough, has, decreased, in, some, areas, threatened, by, soil, damage, and, erosion, used, instead, is, shallower, ploughing, or, other, less, invasive, conservation, tillage, the, plough, appears, in, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, pieces, of, written, literature, from, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, where, it, is, personified, and, debating, with, another, tool, the, hoe, over, which, is, better, a, sumerian, disputation, poem, known, as, the, debate, between, the, hoe, and, the, plough, in, older, english, as, in, other, germanic, languages, the, plough, was, traditionally, known, by, other, names, e, g, old, english, sulh, modern, dialectal, sullow, old, high, german, medela, geiza, huohil, n, old, norse, ar, r, swedish, rder, and, gothic, h, ha, all, presumably, referring, to, the, ard, scratch, plough, the, modern, word, comes, from, the, old, norse, pl, gr, and, is, therefore, germanic, but, it, appears, relatively, late, it, is, not, attested, in, gothic, and, is, thought, to, be, a, loan, from, one, of, the, north, italic, languages, the, german, cognate, is, pflug, the, dutch, ploeg, and, the, swedish, plog, in, many, slavic, languages, and, in, romanian, the, word, is, plug, words, with, the, same, root, appeared, with, related, meanings, in, raetic, plaumorati, wheeled, heavy, plough, pliny, nat, hist, 18, 172, and, in, latin, plaustrum, farm, cart, pl, strum, pl, stellum, cart, and, pl, xenum, pl, ximum, cart, box, the, word, must, have, originally, referred, to, the, wheeled, heavy, plough, common, in, roman, north, western, europe, by, the, 5th, century, ad, many, view, plough, as, a, derivative, of, the, verb, plehan, plegan, to, take, responsibility, cf, german, pflegen, to, look, after, nurse, which, would, explain, for, example, old, high, german, pfluog, with, its, double, meaning, of, plough, and, livelihood, guus, kroonen, 2013, proposes, a, v, ddhi, derivative, of, plag, kk, n, sod, cf, dutch, plag, sod, old, norse, plagg, cloth, middle, high, german, pflacke, rag, patch, stain, finally, vladimir, orel, 2003, tentatively, attaches, plough, to, a, pie, stem, bl, k, which, supposedly, gave, old, armenian, pe, em, to, dig, and, welsh, bwlch, crack, though, the, word, may, not, be, of, indo, european, origin, the, basic, parts, of, the, modern, plough, are, other, parts, include, the, frog, or, frame, runner, landside, shin, trashboard, and, stilts, handles, on, modern, ploughs, and, some, older, ploughs, the, mould, board, is, separate, from, the, share, and, runner, so, these, parts, can, be, replaced, without, replacing, the, mould, board, abrasion, eventually, wears, out, all, parts, of, a, plough, that, come, into, contact, with, the, soil, when, agriculture, was, first, developed, soil, was, turned, using, simple, hand, held, digging, sticks, and, hoes, these, were, used, in, highly, fertile, areas, such, as, the, banks, of, the, nile, where, the, annual, flood, rejuvenates, the, soil, to, create, drills, furrows, in, which, to, plant, seeds, digging, sticks, hoes, and, mattocks, were, not, invented, in, any, one, place, and, hoe, cultivation, must, have, been, common, everywhere, agriculture, was, practised, hoe, farming, is, the, traditional, tillage, method, in, tropical, or, sub, tropical, regions, which, are, marked, by, stony, soils, steep, slope, gradients, predominant, root, crops, and, coarse, grains, grown, at, wide, intervals, while, hoe, agriculture, is, best, suited, to, these, regions, it, is, used, in, some, fashion, everywhere, some, ancient, hoes, like, the, egyptian, mr, were, pointed, and, strong, enough, to, clear, rocky, soil, and, make, seed, drills, which, is, why, they, are, called, hand, ards, however, domestication, of, oxen, in, mesopotamia, and, the, indus, valley, civilisation, perhaps, as, early, as, the, 6th, millennium, bc, provided, mankind, with, the, draft, power, needed, to, develop, the, larger, animal, drawn, true, ard, or, scratch, plough, the, earliest, surviving, evidence, of, ploughing, has, been, dated, to, 3500, 3800, bce, on, a, site, in, bubene, czech, republic, a, ploughed, field, from, c, 2800, bce, was, also, discovered, at, kalibangan, india, a, terracotta, model, of, the, early, ards, was, found, at, banawali, india, giving, insight, into, the, form, of, the, tool, used, the, ard, remained, easy, to, replace, if, it, became, damaged, and, easy, to, replicate, the, earliest, was, the, bow, ard, which, consists, of, a, draft, pole, or, beam, pierced, by, a, thinner, vertical, pointed, stick, called, the, head, or, body, with, one, end, being, the, stilt, handle, and, the, other, a, share, cutting, blade, dragged, through, the, topsoil, to, cut, a, shallow, furrow, suitable, for, most, cereal, crops, the, ard, does, not, clear, new, land, well, so, hoes, or, mattocks, had, to, be, used, to, pull, up, grass, and, undergrowth, and, a, hand, held, coulter, like, ristle, could, be, made, to, cut, deeper, furrows, ahead, of, the, share, because, the, ard, left, a, strip, of, undisturbed, earth, between, furrows, the, fields, were, often, cross, ploughed, lengthwise, and, breadth, wise, which, tended, to, form, squarish, celtic, fields, 42, the, ard, is, best, suited, to, loamy, or, sandy, soils, that, are, naturally, fertilised, by, annual, flooding, as, in, the, nile, delta, and, fertile, crescent, and, to, a, lesser, extent, any, other, cereal, growing, region, with, light, or, thin, soil, to, grow, crops, regularly, in, less, fertile, areas, it, was, once, believed, that, the, soil, must, be, turned, to, bring, nutrients, to, the, surface, a, major, advance, for, this, type, of, farming, was, the, turn, plough, also, known, as, the, mould, board, plough, uk, moldboard, plow, u, s, or, frame, plough, a, coulter, or, skeith, could, be, added, to, cut, vertically, into, the, ground, just, ahead, of, the, share, in, front, of, the, frog, a, wedge, shaped, cutting, edge, at, the, bottom, front, of, the, mould, board, with, the, landside, of, the, frame, supporting, the, under, share, below, ground, component, the, heavy, iron, moldboard, plow, was, invented, in, china, s, han, empire, in, the, 1st, and, 2nd, century, and, from, where, it, was, spread, to, holland, which, led, the, agricultural, revolution, the, mould, board, plough, introduced, in, the, 18th, century, was, a, major, advance, in, technology, chinese, ploughs, from, han, times, on, fulfil, all, these, conditions, of, efficiency, nicely, which, is, presumably, why, the, standard, han, plough, team, consisted, of, two, animals, only, and, later, teams, usually, of, a, single, animal, rather, than, the, four, six, or, eight, draught, animals, common, in, europe, before, the, introduction, of, the, curved, mould, board, and, other, new, principles, of, design, in, the, 18th, century, though, the, mould, board, plough, first, appeared, in, europe, in, early, medieval, if, not, in, late, roman, times, pre, eighteenth, century, mould, boards, were, usually, wooden, and, straight, fig, 59, the, enormous, labour, involved, in, pulling, such, a, clumsy, construction, necessitated, large, plough, teams, and, this, meant, that, large, areas, of, land, had, to, be, reserved, as, pasture, in, china, where, much, less, animal, power, was, required, it, was, not, necessary, to, maintain, the, mixed, arable, pasture, economy, typical, of, europe, fallows, could, be, reduced, and, the, arable, area, expanded, and, a, considerably, larger, population, could, be, supported, than, on, the, same, amount, of, land, in, europe, the, upper, parts, of, the, frame, carry, from, the, front, the, coupling, for, the, motive, power, horses, the, coulter, and, the, landside, frame, depending, on, the, size, of, the, implement, and, the, number, of, furrows, it, is, designed, to, plough, at, one, time, a, fore, carriage, with, a, wheel, or, wheels, known, as, a, furrow, wheel, and, support, wheel, may, be, added, to, support, the, frame, wheeled, plough, in, the, case, of, a, single, furrow, plough, there, is, one, wheel, at, the, front, and, handles, at, the, rear, for, the, ploughman, to, maneuver, it, when, dragged, through, a, field, the, coulter, cuts, down, into, the, soil, and, the, share, cuts, horizontally, from, the, previous, furrow, to, the, vertical, cut, this, releases, a, rectangular, strip, of, sod, to, be, lifted, by, the, share, and, carried, by, the, mould, board, up, and, over, so, that, the, strip, of, sod, slice, of, the, topsoil, that, is, being, cut, lifts, and, rolls, over, as, the, plough, moves, forward, dropping, back, upside, down, into, the, furrow, and, onto, the, turned, soil, from, the, previous, run, down, the, field, each, gap, in, the, ground, where, the, soil, has, been, lifted, and, moved, across, usually, to, the, right, is, called, a, furrow, the, sod, lifted, from, it, rests, at, an, angle, of, about, 45, degrees, in, the, adjacent, furrow, up, the, back, of, the, sod, from, the, previous, run, a, series, of, ploughings, run, down, a, field, leaves, a, row, of, sods, partly, in, the, furrows, and, partly, on, the, ground, lifted, earlier, visually, across, the, rows, there, is, the, land, on, the, left, a, furrow, half, the, width, of, the, removed, strip, of, soil, and, the, removed, strip, almost, upside, down, lying, on, about, half, of, the, previous, strip, of, inverted, soil, and, so, on, across, the, field, each, layer, of, soil, and, the, gutter, it, came, from, forms, a, classic, furrow, the, mould, board, plough, greatly, reduced, the, time, needed, to, prepare, a, field, and, so, allowed, a, farmer, to, work, a, larger, area, of, land, in, addition, the, resulting, pattern, of, low, under, the, mould, board, and, high, beside, it, ridges, in, the, soil, forms, water, channels, allowing, the, soil, to, drain, in, areas, where, snow, build, up, causes, difficulties, this, lets, farmers, plant, the, soil, earlier, as, the, meltwater, run, off, drains, away, more, quickly, there, are, five, major, parts, of, a, mouldboard, plough, the, share, landside, and, mould, board, are, bolted, to, the, frog, which, is, an, irregular, piece, of, cast, iron, at, the, base, of, the, plough, body, to, which, the, soil, wearing, parts, are, bolted, the, share, is, the, edge, that, makes, the, horizontal, cut, to, separate, the, furrow, slice, from, the, soil, below, conventional, shares, are, shaped, to, penetrate, soil, efficiently, the, tip, is, pointed, downward, to, pull, the, share, into, the, ground, to, a, regular, depth, the, clearance, usually, referred, to, as, suction, or, down, suction, varies, with, different, makes, and, types, of, plough, share, configuration, is, related, to, soil, type, particularly, in, the, down, suction, or, concavity, of, its, lower, surface, generally, three, degrees, of, clearance, or, down, suction, are, recognised, regular, for, light, soil, deep, for, ordinary, dry, soil, and, double, deep, for, clay, and, gravelly, soils, as, the, share, wears, away, it, becomes, blunt, and, the, plough, will, require, more, power, to, pull, it, through, the, soil, a, plough, body, with, a, worn, share, will, not, have, enough, suck, to, ensure, it, delves, the, ground, to, its, full, working, depth, in, addition, the, share, has, horizontal, suction, related, to, the, amount, its, point, is, bent, out, of, line, with, the, land, side, down, suction, causes, the, plough, to, penetrate, to, proper, depth, when, pulled, forward, while, horizontal, suction, causes, the, plough, to, create, the, desired, width, of, furrow, the, share, is, a, plane, part, with, a, trapezoidal, shape, it, cuts, the, soil, horizontally, and, lifts, it, common, types, are, regular, winged, plane, bar, point, and, share, with, mounted, or, welded, point, the, regular, share, conserves, a, good, cut, but, is, recommended, on, stone, free, soils, the, winged, plane, share, is, used, on, heavy, soil, with, a, moderate, amount, of, stones, the, bar, point, share, can, be, used, in, extreme, conditions, hard, and, stony, soils, the, share, with, a, mounted, point, is, somewhere, between, the, last, two, types, makers, have, designed, shares, of, various, shapes, trapesium, diamond, etc, with, bolted, point, and, wings, often, separately, renewable, sometimes, the, share, cutting, edge, is, placed, well, in, advance, of, the, mould, board, to, reduce, the, pulverizing, action, of, the, soil, the, mould, board, is, the, part, of, the, plough, that, receives, the, furrow, slice, from, the, share, it, is, responsible, for, lifting, and, turning, the, furrow, slice, and, sometimes, for, shattering, it, depending, on, the, type, of, mould, board, ploughing, depth, and, soil, conditions, the, intensity, of, this, depends, on, the, type, of, mould, board, to, suit, different, soil, conditions, and, crop, requirements, mould, boards, have, been, designed, in, different, shapes, each, producing, its, own, furrow, profile, and, surface, finish, but, essentially, they, still, conform, to, the, original, plough, body, classification, the, various, types, have, been, traditionally, classified, as, general, purpose, digger, and, semi, digger, as, described, below, the, land, side, is, the, flat, plate, which, presses, against, and, transmits, the, lateral, thrust, of, the, plough, bottom, to, the, furrow, wall, it, helps, to, resist, the, side, pressure, exerted, by, the, furrow, slice, on, the, mould, board, it, also, helps, to, stabilise, the, plough, while, in, operation, the, rear, bottom, end, of, the, landslide, which, rubs, against, the, furrow, sole, is, known, as, the, heel, a, heel, iron, is, bolted, to, the, end, of, the, rear, of, the, land, side, and, helps, to, support, the, back, of, the, plough, the, land, side, and, share, are, arranged, to, give, a, lead, towards, the, unploughed, land, so, helping, to, sustain, the, correct, furrow, width, the, land, side, is, usually, made, of, solid, medium, carbon, steel, and, is, very, short, except, at, the, rear, bottom, of, the, plough, the, heel, or, rear, end, of, the, rear, land, side, may, be, subject, to, excessive, wear, if, the, rear, wheel, is, out, of, adjustment, and, so, a, chilled, iron, heel, piece, is, frequently, used, this, is, inexpensive, and, can, be, easily, replaced, the, land, side, is, fastened, to, the, frog, by, plough, bolts, the, frog, standard, is, the, central, part, of, the, plough, bottom, to, which, the, other, components, of, the, bottom, are, attached, it, is, an, irregular, piece, of, metal, which, may, be, made, of, cast, iron, for, cast, iron, ploughs, or, welded, steel, for, steel, ploughs, the, frog, is, the, foundation, of, the, plough, bottom, it, takes, the, shock, resulting, from, hitting, rocks, and, therefore, should, be, tough, and, strong, the, frog, is, in, turn, fastened, to, the, plough, frame, a, runner, extending, from, behind, the, share, to, the, rear, of, the, plough, controls, the, direction, of, the, plough, because, it, is, held, against, the, bottom, land, side, corner, of, the, new, furrow, being, formed, the, holding, force, is, the, weight, of, the, sod, as, it, is, raised, and, rotated, on, the, curved, surface, of, the, mould, board, because, of, this, runner, the, mould, board, plough, is, harder, to, turn, around, than, the, scratch, plough, and, its, introduction, brought, about, a, change, in, the, shape, of, fields, from, mostly, square, fields, into, longer, rectangular, strips, hence, the, introduction, of, the, furlong, an, advance, on, the, basic, design, was, the, iron, ploughshare, a, replaceable, horizontal, cutting, surface, mounted, on, the, tip, of, the, share, the, earliest, ploughs, with, a, detachable, and, replaceable, share, date, from, around, 1000, bc, in, the, ancient, near, east, and, the, earliest, iron, ploughshares, from, about, 500, bc, in, china, early, mould, boards, were, wedges, that, sat, inside, the, cut, formed, by, the, coulter, turning, over, the, soil, to, the, side, the, ploughshare, spread, the, cut, horizontally, below, the, surface, so, that, when, the, mould, board, lifted, it, a, wider, area, of, soil, was, turned, over, mould, boards, are, known, in, britain, from, the, late, 6th, century, onwards, there, are, multiple, types, of, ploughs, available, when, a, plough, hits, a, rock, or, other, solid, obstruction, serious, damage, may, result, unless, the, plough, is, equipped, with, some, safety, device, the, damage, may, be, bent, or, broken, shares, bent, standards, beams, or, braces, the, three, basic, types, of, safety, devices, used, on, mould, board, ploughs, are, a, spring, release, device, in, the, plough, drawbar, a, trip, beam, construction, on, each, bottom, and, an, automatic, reset, design, on, each, bottom, the, spring, release, was, used, in, the, past, almost, universally, on, trailing, type, ploughs, with, one, to, three, or, four, bottoms, it, is, not, practical, on, larger, ploughs, when, an, obstruction, is, encountered, the, spring, release, mechanism, in, the, hitch, permits, the, plough, to, uncouple, from, the, tractor, when, a, hydraulic, lift, is, used, on, the, plough, the, hydraulic, hoses, will, also, usually, uncouple, automatically, when, the, plough, uncouples, most, plough, makers, offer, an, automatic, reset, system, for, tough, conditions, or, rocky, soils, the, re, set, mechanism, allows, each, body, to, move, rearward, and, upward, to, pass, without, damage, over, obstacles, such, as, rocks, hidden, below, soil, surface, a, heavy, leaf, or, coil, spring, mechanism, that, holds, the, body, in, its, working, position, under, normal, conditions, resets, the, plough, after, the, obstruction, is, passed, another, type, of, auto, reset, mechanism, uses, an, oil, hydraulic, and, gas, accumulator, shock, loads, cause, the, oil, to, compress, the, gas, when, the, gas, expands, again, the, leg, returns, to, its, working, ploughing, position, after, passing, over, the, obstacle, the, simplest, mechanism, is, a, breaking, shear, bolt, that, needs, replacement, shear, bolts, that, break, when, a, plough, body, hits, an, obstruction, are, a, cheaper, overload, protection, device, trip, beam, ploughs, are, constructed, with, a, hinge, point, in, the, beam, this, is, usually, located, some, distance, above, the, top, of, the, plough, bottom, the, bottom, is, held, in, normal, ploughing, position, by, a, spring, operated, latch, when, an, obstruction, is, encountered, the, entire, bottom, is, released, and, hinges, back, and, up, to, pass, over, the, obstruction, it, is, necessary, to, back, up, the, tractor, and, plough, to, reset, the, bottom, this, construction, is, used, to, protect, the, individual, bottoms, the, automatic, reset, design, has, only, recently, been, introduced, on, us, ploughs, but, has, been, used, extensively, on, european, and, australian, ploughs, here, the, beam, is, hinged, at, a, point, almost, above, the, point, of, the, share, the, bottom, is, held, in, the, normal, position, by, a, set, of, springs, or, a, hydraulic, cylinder, on, each, bottom, when, an, obstruction, is, encountered, the, plough, bottom, hinges, back, and, up, in, such, a, way, as, to, pass, over, the, obstruction, without, stopping, the, tractor, and, plough, the, bottom, automatically, returns, to, normal, ploughing, position, as, soon, as, the, obstruction, is, passed, without, any, interruption, of, forward, motion, the, automatic, reset, design, permits, higher, field, efficiencies, since, stopping, for, stones, is, practically, eliminated, it, also, reduces, costs, for, broken, shares, beams, and, other, parts, the, fast, resetting, action, helps, produce, a, better, job, of, ploughing, as, large, areas, of, unploughed, land, are, not, left, as, they, are, when, lifting, a, plough, over, a, stone, manual, loy, ploughing, was, a, form, used, on, small, farms, in, ireland, where, farmers, could, not, afford, more, or, on, hilly, ground, that, precluded, horses, it, was, used, up, until, the, 1960s, in, poorer, land, it, suited, the, moist, irish, climate, as, the, trenches, formed, by, turning, in, the, sods, provided, drainage, it, allowed, potatoes, to, be, grown, in, bogs, peat, swamps, and, on, otherwise, unfarmed, mountain, slopes, in, the, basic, mould, board, plough, the, depth, of, cut, is, adjusted, by, lifting, against, the, runner, in, the, furrow, which, limited, the, weight, of, the, plough, to, what, a, ploughman, could, easily, lift, this, limited, the, construction, to, a, small, amount, of, wood, although, metal, edges, were, possible, these, ploughs, were, fairly, fragile, and, unsuitable, for, the, heavier, soils, of, northern, europe, the, introduction, of, wheels, to, replace, the, runner, allowed, the, weight, of, the, plough, to, increase, and, in, turn, the, use, of, a, larger, mould, board, faced, in, metal, these, heavy, ploughs, led, to, greater, food, production, and, eventually, a, marked, population, increase, beginning, around, ad, 1000, before, the, han, dynasty, 202, bc, ad, 220, chinese, ploughs, were, made, almost, wholly, of, wood, except, for, the, iron, blade, of, the, ploughshare, these, were, v, shaped, iron, pieces, mounted, on, wooden, blades, and, handles, by, the, han, period, the, entire, ploughshare, was, made, of, cast, iron, these, are, the, earliest, known, heavy, mould, board, iron, ploughs, several, advancements, such, as, the, three, shared, plow, the, plow, and, sow, implement, and, the, harrow, were, developed, subsequently, by, the, end, of, the, song, dynasty, in, 1279, chinese, ploughs, had, reached, a, state, of, development, that, would, not, be, seen, in, holland, until, the, 17th, century, the, romans, achieved, a, heavy, wheeled, mould, board, plough, in, the, late, 3rd, and, 4th, century, ad, for, which, archaeological, evidence, appears, for, instance, in, roman, britain, the, greek, and, roman, mould, boards, were, usually, tied, to, the, bottom, of, the, shaft, with, bits, of, rope, which, made, them, more, fragile, than, the, chinese, ones, and, iron, mould, boards, did, not, appear, in, europe, until, the, 10th, century, the, first, indisputable, appearance, after, the, roman, period, is, in, a, northern, italian, document, of, 643, 50, old, words, connected, with, the, heavy, plough, and, its, use, appear, in, slavic, suggesting, possible, early, use, in, that, region, 49ff, general, adoption, of, the, carruca, heavy, plough, in, europe, seems, to, have, accompanied, adoption, of, the, three, field, system, in, the, later, 8th, and, early, 9th, centuries, leading, to, improved, agricultural, productivity, per, unit, of, land, in, northern, europe, 69, 78, this, was, accompanied, by, larger, fields, known, variously, as, carucates, ploughlands, and, plough, gates, the, basic, plough, with, coulter, ploughshare, and, mould, board, remained, in, use, for, a, millennium, major, changes, in, design, spread, widely, in, the, age, of, enlightenment, when, there, was, rapid, progress, in, design, joseph, foljambe, in, rotherham, england, in, 1730, used, new, shapes, based, on, the, rotherham, plough, which, covered, the, mould, board, with, iron, unlike, the, heavy, plough, the, rotherham, or, rotherham, swing, plough, consisted, entirely, of, the, coulter, mould, board, and, handles, it, was, much, lighter, than, earlier, designs, and, became, common, in, england, it, may, have, been, the, first, plough, widely, built, in, factories, and, commercially, successful, there, in, 1789, robert, ransome, an, iron, founder, in, ipswich, started, casting, ploughshares, in, a, disused, malting, at, st, margaret, s, ditches, a, broken, mould, in, his, foundry, caused, molten, metal, to, come, into, contact, with, cold, metal, making, the, metal, surface, extremely, hard, this, process, chilled, casting, resulted, in, what, ransome, advertised, as, self, sharpening, ploughs, he, received, patents, for, his, discovery, james, small, further, advanced, the, design, using, mathematical, methods, he, eventually, arrived, at, a, shape, cast, from, a, single, piece, of, iron, an, improvement, on, the, scots, plough, of, james, anderson, of, hermiston, a, single, piece, cast, iron, plough, was, also, developed, and, patented, by, charles, newbold, in, the, united, states, this, was, again, improved, on, by, jethro, wood, a, blacksmith, of, scipio, new, york, who, made, a, three, part, scots, plough, that, allowed, a, broken, piece, to, be, replaced, in, 1833, john, lane, invented, a, steel, plough, then, in, 1837, john, deere, introduced, a, steel, plough, it, was, so, much, stronger, than, iron, designs, that, it, could, work, soil, in, us, areas, previously, thought, unsuitable, for, farming, improvements, on, this, followed, developments, in, metallurgy, steel, coulters, and, shares, with, softer, iron, mould, boards, to, prevent, breakage, the, chilled, plough, an, early, example, of, surface, hardened, steel, and, eventually, mould, boards, with, faces, strong, enough, to, dispense, with, the, coulter, by, the, time, of, the, early, 1900s, the, steel, plough, had, many, uses, shapes, and, names, the, two, horse, breaking, plough, had, a, point, and, wing, used, to, break, the, soil, s, surface, and, turn, the, dirt, out, and, over, the, shovel, plough, was, used, to, lay, off, the, rows, the, harrow, plough, was, used, to, cover, the, planted, seed, the, scratcher, or, geewhiz, was, used, to, deweed, or, cultivate, the, crop, the, bulltongue, and, sweeps, were, used, to, plough, the, middle, of, the, rows, all, these, metal, plough, points, required, being, re, sharpened, about, every, ten, days, due, to, their, use, on, rough, and, rocky, ground, the, first, mould, board, ploughs, could, only, turn, the, soil, over, in, one, direction, conventionally, to, the, right, as, dictated, by, the, shape, of, the, mould, board, therefore, a, field, had, to, be, ploughed, in, long, strips, or, lands, the, plough, was, usually, worked, clockwise, around, each, land, ploughing, the, long, sides, and, being, dragged, across, the, short, sides, without, ploughing, the, length, of, the, strip, was, limited, by, the, distance, oxen, later, horses, could, comfortably, work, without, rest, and, their, width, by, the, distance, the, plough, could, conveniently, be, dragged, these, distances, determined, the, traditional, size, of, the, strips, a, furlong, or, furrow, s, length, 220, yards, 200, m, by, a, chain, 22, yards, 20, m, an, area, of, one, acre, about, 0, 4, hectares, this, is, the, origin, of, the, acre, the, one, sided, action, gradually, moved, soil, from, the, sides, to, the, centre, line, of, the, strip, if, the, strip, was, in, the, same, place, each, year, the, soil, built, up, into, a, ridge, creating, the, ridge, and, furrow, topography, still, seen, in, some, ancient, fields, the, turn, wrest, plough, allows, ploughing, to, be, done, to, either, side, the, mould, board, is, removable, turning, to, the, right, for, one, furrow, then, being, moved, to, the, other, side, of, the, plough, to, turn, to, the, left, the, coulter, and, ploughshare, are, fixed, thus, adjacent, furrows, can, be, ploughed, in, opposite, directions, allowing, ploughing, to, proceed, continuously, along, the, field, and, so, avoid, the, ridge, furrow, topography, the, reversible, or, roll, over, plough, has, two, mould, board, ploughs, mounted, back, to, back, one, turning, right, the, other, left, while, one, works, the, land, the, other, is, borne, upside, down, in, the, air, at, the, end, of, each, row, the, paired, ploughs, are, turned, over, so, that, the, other, can, be, used, along, the, next, furrow, again, working, the, field, in, a, consistent, direction, these, ploughs, date, back, to, the, days, of, the, steam, engine, and, the, horse, in, almost, universal, use, on, farms, they, have, right, and, left, handed, mould, boards, enabling, them, to, work, up, and, down, the, same, furrow, reversible, ploughs, may, either, be, mounted, or, semi, mounted, and, are, heavier, and, more, expensive, than, right, handed, models, but, have, the, great, advantage, of, leaving, a, level, surface, that, facilitates, seedbed, preparation, and, harvesting, very, little, marking, out, is, necessary, before, ploughing, can, start, idle, running, on, the, headland, is, minimal, compared, with, conventional, ploughs, driving, a, tractor, with, furrow, side, wheels, in, the, furrow, bottom, provides, the, most, efficient, line, of, draught, between, tractor, and, plough, it, is, also, easier, to, steer, the, tractor, driving, with, the, front, wheel, against, the, furrow, wall, will, keep, the, front, furrow, at, the, correct, width, this, is, less, satisfactory, when, using, a, tractor, with, wide, front, tyres, although, these, make, better, use, of, the, tractor, power, the, tyres, may, compact, some, of, the, last, furrow, slice, turned, on, the, previous, run, the, problem, is, overcome, by, using, a, furrow, widener, or, longer, mould, board, on, the, rear, body, the, latter, moves, the, soil, further, towards, the, ploughed, land, leaving, more, room, for, the, tractor, wheels, on, the, next, run, driving, with, all, four, wheels, on, unploughed, land, is, another, solution, to, the, problem, of, wide, tyres, semi, mounted, ploughs, can, be, hitched, in, a, way, that, allows, the, tractor, to, run, on, unbroken, land, and, pull, the, plough, in, correct, alignment, without, any, sideways, movement, crabbing, early, steel, ploughs, were, walking, ploughs, directed, by, a, ploughman, holding, handles, on, either, side, of, the, plough, steel, ploughs, were, so, much, easier, to, draw, through, the, soil, that, constant, adjustment, of, the, blade, to, deal, with, roots, or, clods, was, no, longer, necessary, as, the, plough, could, easily, cut, through, them, not, long, after, that, the, first, riding, ploughs, appeared, whose, wheels, kept, the, plough, at, an, adjustable, level, above, the, ground, while, the, ploughman, sat, on, a, seat, instead, of, walking, direction, was, now, controlled, mostly, through, the, draught, team, with, levers, allowing, fine, adjustments, this, led, quickly, to, riding, ploughs, with, multiple, mould, boards, which, dramatically, increased, ploughing, performance, a, single, draught, horse, can, normally, pull, a, single, furrow, plough, in, clean, light, soil, but, in, heavier, soils, two, horses, are, needed, one, walking, on, the, land, and, one, in, the, furrow, ploughs, with, two, or, more, furrows, call, for, more, than, two, horses, and, usually, one, or, more, have, to, walk, on, the, ploughed, sod, which, is, hard, going, for, them, and, means, they, tread, newly, ploughed, land, down, it, is, usual, to, rest, such, horses, every, half, hour, for, about, ten, minutes, john, deere, an, illinois, blacksmith, noted, that, ploughing, many, sticky, non, sandy, soils, might, benefit, from, modifications, in, the, design, of, the, mould, board, and, the, metals, used, a, polished, needle, would, enter, leather, and, fabric, with, greater, ease, and, a, polished, pitchfork, also, require, less, effort, looking, for, a, polished, slicker, surface, for, a, plough, he, experimented, with, portions, of, saw, blades, and, by, 1837, was, making, polished, cast, steel, ploughs, the, invention, of, the, mobile, steam, engine, allowed, steam, power, to, be, applied, to, ploughing, from, about, 1850, in, europe, soil, conditions, were, often, too, soft, to, support, the, weight, of, a, traction, engine, instead, counterbalanced, wheeled, ploughs, known, as, balance, ploughs, were, drawn, by, cables, across, the, fields, by, pairs, of, ploughing, engines, on, opposite, field, edges, or, by, a, single, engine, drawing, directly, towards, it, at, one, end, and, drawing, away, from, it, via, a, pulley, at, the, other, the, balance, plough, had, two, sets, of, facing, ploughs, arranged, so, that, when, one, was, in, the, ground, the, other, was, lifted, in, the, air, when, pulled, in, one, direction, the, trailing, ploughs, were, lowered, onto, the, ground, by, the, tension, on, the, cable, when, the, plough, reached, the, edge, of, the, field, the, other, engine, pulled, the, opposite, cable, and, the, plough, tilted, balanced, putting, the, other, set, of, shares, into, the, ground, and, the, plough, worked, back, across, the, field, one, set, of, ploughs, was, right, handed, and, the, other, left, handed, allowing, continuous, ploughing, along, the, field, as, with, the, turn, wrest, and, reversible, ploughs, the, man, credited, with, inventing, the, ploughing, engine, and, associated, balance, plough, in, the, mid, 19th, century, was, john, fowler, an, english, agricultural, engineer, and, inventor, however, the, fisken, brothers, demonstrated, and, went, on, to, patent, a, balance, plough, about, 4, years, before, fowler, one, notable, producer, of, steam, powered, ploughs, was, j, kemna, of, eastern, prussia, who, became, the, leading, steam, plough, company, on, the, european, continent, and, penetrated, the, monopoly, of, english, companies, on, the, world, market, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, stump, jump, plough, was, invented, in, 1876, by, australian, richard, bowyer, smith, alongside, his, brother, clarence, herbert, smith, it, is, designed, to, break, up, new, farming, land, that, contains, tree, stumps, and, rocks, expensive, to, remove, it, uses, a, moveable, weight, to, hold, the, ploughshare, in, position, when, a, tree, stump, or, rock, is, encountered, the, ploughshare, is, thrown, up, clear, of, the, obstacle, to, avoid, breaking, its, harness, or, linkage, ploughing, can, continue, when, the, weight, is, returned, to, the, earth, a, simpler, later, system, uses, a, concave, disc, or, pair, of, them, set, at, a, wide, angle, to, the, direction, of, progress, using, a, concave, shape, to, hold, the, disc, into, the, soil, unless, something, hard, strikes, the, circumference, of, the, disc, causing, it, to, roll, up, and, over, the, obstruction, as, this, is, dragged, forward, the, sharp, edge, of, the, disc, cuts, the, soil, and, the, concave, surface, of, the, rotating, disc, lifts, and, throws, the, soil, to, the, side, it, does, not, work, as, well, as, a, mould, board, plough, but, this, is, not, seen, as, a, drawback, because, it, helps, to, fight, wind, erosion, but, it, does, lift, and, break, up, the, soil, see, disc, harrow, modern, ploughs, are, usually, multiply, reversible, mounted, on, a, tractor, with, a, three, point, linkage, these, commonly, have, from, two, to, as, many, as, seven, mould, boards, and, semi, mounted, ploughs, whose, lifting, is, assisted, by, a, wheel, about, halfway, along, their, length, can, have, as, many, as, 18, the, tractor, s, hydraulics, are, used, to, lift, and, reverse, the, implement, and, to, adjust, furrow, width, and, depth, the, plougher, still, has, to, set, the, draughting, linkage, from, the, tractor, so, that, the, plough, keeps, the, proper, angle, in, the, soil, this, angle, and, depth, can, be, controlled, automatically, by, modern, tractors, as, a, complement, to, the, rear, plough, a, two, or, three, mould, board, plough, can, be, mounted, on, the, front, of, the, tractor, if, it, is, equipped, with, front, three, point, linkage, the, chisel, plough, is, a, common, tool, for, deep, tillage, prepared, land, with, limited, soil, disruption, its, main, function, is, to, loosen, and, aerate, the, soils, while, leaving, crop, residue, on, top, this, plough, can, be, used, to, reduce, the, effects, of, soil, compaction, and, to, help, break, up, ploughpan, and, hardpan, unlike, many, other, ploughs, the, chisel, will, not, invert, or, turn, the, soil, this, feature, has, made, it, a, useful, addition, to, no, till, and, low, till, farming, practices, that, attempt, to, maximise, the, erosion, preventing, benefits, of, keeping, organic, matter, and, farming, residues, present, on, the, soil, surface, throughout, the, year, thus, the, chisel, plough, is, considered, by, some, to, be, more, sustainable, than, other, types, of, plough, such, as, the, mould, board, plough, chisel, ploughs, are, becoming, more, popular, as, a, primary, tillage, tool, in, row, crop, farming, areas, basically, the, chisel, plough, is, a, heavy, duty, field, cultivator, intended, to, operate, at, depths, from, 15, cm, 5, 9, in, to, as, much, as, 46, cm, 18, in, however, some, models, may, run, much, deeper, each, individual, plough, or, shank, is, typically, set, from, 230, mm, 9, in, to, 360, mm, 14, in, apart, such, a, plough, can, meet, significant, soil, drag, a, tractor, of, sufficient, power, and, traction, is, required, when, ploughing, with, a, chisel, plough, 10, 20, horsepower, 7, 5, 14, 9, kw, per, shank, is, required, depending, on, depth, pull, type, chisel, ploughs, are, made, in, working, widths, from, about, 2, 5, metres, 8, ft, 2, in, up, to, 13, 7, metres, 45, ft, they, are, tractor, mounted, and, working, depth, is, hydraulically, controlled, those, more, than, about, 4, metres, 13, ft, wide, may, be, equipped, with, folding, wings, to, reduce, transport, width, wider, machines, may, have, the, wings, supported, by, individual, wheels, and, hinge, joints, to, allow, flexing, of, the, machine, over, uneven, ground, the, wider, models, usually, have, a, wheel, each, side, to, control, working, depth, three, point, hitch, mounted, units, are, made, in, widths, from, about, 1, 5, to, 9, metres, 4, ft, 11, in, to, 29, ft, 6, in, cultivators, are, often, similar, in, form, to, chisel, ploughs, but, their, goals, are, different, cultivator, teeth, work, near, the, surface, usually, for, weed, control, whereas, chisel, plough, shanks, work, deep, under, the, surface, therefore, cultivation, takes, much, less, power, per, shank, than, does, chisel, ploughing, the, country, plough, is, a, slanted, plough, the, most, common, plough, in, india, it, is, recommended, for, crops, like, groundnut, after, the, use, of, a, tractor, a, ridging, plough, is, used, for, crops, such, as, potatoes, or, scallions, grown, buried, in, ridges, of, soil, using, a, technique, called, ridging, or, hilling, a, ridging, plough, has, two, back, to, back, mould, boards, cutting, a, deep, furrow, on, each, pass, with, high, ridges, either, side, the, same, plough, may, be, used, to, split, the, ridges, to, harvest, the, crop, this, variety, of, ridge, plough, is, notable, for, having, a, blade, pointing, towards, the, operator, it, is, used, solely, by, human, effort, rather, than, with, animal, or, machine, assistance, and, pulled, backwards, by, the, operator, requiring, great, physical, effort, it, is, particularly, used, for, second, breaking, of, ground, and, for, potato, planting, it, is, found, in, shetland, some, western, crofts, and, more, rarely, central, scotland, typically, on, holdings, too, small, or, poor, to, merit, the, use, of, animals, functionally, operating, as, a, saw, but, pulled, as, a, plough, this, device, was, created, in, the, 19th, century, and, was, mainly, used, in, scandinavia, as, part, of, the, ice, export, industry, creating, blocks, of, ice, to, ship, to, great, britain, the, mole, plough, allows, under, drainage, to, be, installed, without, trenches, or, breaks, up, the, deep, impermeable, soil, layers, that, impede, it, it, is, a, deep, plough, with, a, torpedo, or, wedge, shaped, tip, and, a, narrow, blade, connecting, it, to, the, body, when, dragged, over, ground, it, leaves, a, channel, deep, under, it, that, acts, as, a, drain, modern, mole, ploughs, may, also, bury, a, flexible, perforated, plastic, drain, pipe, as, they, go, making, a, more, permanent, drain, or, may, be, used, to, lay, pipes, for, water, supply, or, other, purposes, similar, machines, so, called, pipe, and, cable, laying, ploughs, are, even, used, under, the, sea, for, laying, cables, or, for, preparing, the, earth, for, side, scan, sonar, in, a, process, used, in, oil, exploration, compacting, a, tennis, ball, sized, sample, from, moling, depth, by, hand, then, pushing, a, pencil, through, is, a, simple, check, to, find, if, the, subsoil, is, in, the, right, condition, for, mole, ploughing, if, the, hole, stays, intact, without, splitting, the, ball, the, soil, is, in, ideal, condition, for, the, mole, plough, heavy, land, requires, draining, to, reduce, its, water, content, to, a, level, efficient, for, plant, growth, heavy, soils, usually, have, a, system, of, permanent, drains, using, perforated, plastic, or, clay, pipes, that, discharge, into, a, ditch, the, small, tunnels, mole, drains, that, mole, ploughs, form, lie, at, a, depth, of, up, to, 950, mm, 37, in, at, an, angle, to, the, pipe, drains, water, from, the, mole, drains, seeps, into, the, pipes, and, runs, along, them, into, a, ditch, mole, ploughs, are, usually, trailed, and, pulled, by, a, crawler, tractor, but, lighter, models, for, use, on, the, three, point, linkage, of, powerful, four, wheel, drive, tractors, are, also, made, a, mole, plough, has, a, strong, frame, that, slides, along, the, ground, when, the, machine, is, at, work, a, heavy, leg, similar, to, a, sub, soiler, leg, is, attached, to, the, frame, and, a, circular, section, with, a, larger, diameter, expander, on, a, flexible, link, is, bolted, to, the, leg, the, bullet, shaped, share, forms, a, tunnel, in, the, soil, about, 75, mm, 3, 0, in, diameter, and, the, expander, presses, the, soil, outwards, to, form, a, long, lasting, drainage, channel, the, para, plough, or, paraplow, loosens, compacted, soil, layers, 3, to, 4, dm, 12, to, 16, inches, deep, while, maintaining, high, surface, residue, levels, it, is, primary, tillage, implement, for, deep, ploughing, without, inversion, the, spade, plough, is, designed, to, cut, the, soil, and, turn, it, on, its, side, minimising, damage, to, earthworms, soil, microorganism, and, fungi, this, increases, the, sustainability, and, long,
