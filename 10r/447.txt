printing, is, a, process, for, mass, reproducing, text, and, images, using, a, master, form, or, template, the, earliest, non, paper, products, involving, printing, include, cylinder, seals, and, objects, such, as, the, cyrus, cylinder, and, the, cylinders, of, nabonidus, the, earliest, known, form, of, printing, evolved, from, ink, rubbings, made, on, paper, or, cloth, from, texts, on, stone, tablets, used, during, the, sixth, century, printing, by, pressing, an, inked, image, onto, paper, using, woodblock, printing, appeared, later, that, century, later, developments, in, printing, technology, include, the, movable, type, invented, by, bi, sheng, around, 1040, and, the, printing, press, invented, by, johannes, gutenberg, in, the, 15th, century, the, technology, of, printing, played, a, key, role, in, the, development, of, the, renaissance, and, the, scientific, revolution, and, laid, the, material, basis, for, the, modern, knowledge, based, economy, and, the, spread, of, learning, to, the, masses, woodblock, printing, is, a, technique, for, printing, text, images, or, patterns, that, was, used, widely, throughout, east, asia, it, originated, in, china, in, antiquity, as, a, method, of, printing, on, textiles, and, later, on, paper, the, earliest, examples, of, ink, squeeze, rubbings, and, potential, stone, printing, blocks, appear, in, the, mid, sixth, century, in, china, a, type, of, printing, called, mechanical, woodblock, printing, on, paper, started, during, the, 7th, century, in, the, tang, dynasty, and, subsequently, spread, throughout, east, asia, nara, japan, printed, the, hyakumant, darani, en, masse, around, 770, and, distributed, them, to, temples, throughout, japan, in, korea, an, example, of, woodblock, printing, from, the, eighth, century, was, discovered, in, 1966, a, copy, of, the, buddhist, dharani, sutra, called, the, pure, light, dharani, sutra, korean, hanja, rr, mugu, jeonggwang, dae, darani, gyeong, discovered, in, gyeongju, in, a, silla, dynasty, pagoda, that, was, repaired, in, 751, was, undated, but, must, have, been, created, sometime, before, the, reconstruction, of, the, shakyamuni, pagoda, of, bulguk, temple, kyongju, province, in, 751, the, document, is, estimated, to, have, been, created, no, later, than, 704, by, the, ninth, century, printing, on, paper, had, taken, off, and, the, first, completely, surviving, printed, book, is, the, diamond, sutra, british, library, of, 868, uncovered, from, dunhuang, by, the, tenth, century, 400, 000, copies, of, some, sutras, and, pictures, were, printed, and, the, confucian, classics, were, in, print, a, skilled, printer, could, print, up, to, 2, 000, double, page, sheets, per, day, printing, spread, early, to, korea, and, japan, which, also, used, chinese, logograms, but, the, technique, was, also, used, in, turpan, and, vietnam, using, a, number, of, other, scripts, this, technique, then, spread, to, persia, and, russia, this, technique, was, transmitted, to, europe, by, around, 1400, and, was, used, on, paper, for, old, master, prints, and, playing, cards, block, printing, called, tarsh, in, arabic, developed, in, arabic, egypt, during, the, ninth, and, tenth, centuries, mostly, for, prayers, and, amulets, there, is, some, evidence, to, suggest, that, these, print, blocks, were, made, from, non, wood, materials, possibly, tin, lead, or, clay, the, techniques, employed, are, uncertain, block, printing, later, went, out, of, use, during, the, timurid, renaissance, the, printing, technique, in, egypt, was, embraced, by, reproducing, texts, on, paper, strips, and, supplying, them, in, different, copies, to, meet, the, demand, block, printing, first, came, to, europe, as, a, method, for, printing, on, cloth, where, it, was, common, by, 1300, images, printed, on, cloth, for, religious, purposes, could, be, quite, large, and, elaborate, when, paper, became, relatively, easily, available, around, 1400, the, technique, transferred, very, quickly, to, small, woodcut, religious, images, and, playing, cards, printed, on, paper, these, prints, were, produced, in, very, large, numbers, from, about, 1425, onward, around, the, mid, fifteenth, century, block, books, woodcut, books, with, both, text, and, images, usually, carved, in, the, same, block, emerged, as, a, cheaper, alternative, to, manuscripts, and, books, printed, with, movable, type, these, were, all, short, heavily, illustrated, works, the, bestsellers, of, the, day, repeated, in, many, different, block, book, versions, the, ars, moriendi, and, the, biblia, pauperum, were, the, most, common, there, is, still, some, controversy, among, scholars, as, to, whether, their, introduction, preceded, or, in, the, majority, view, followed, the, introduction, of, movable, type, with, the, estimated, range, of, dates, being, between, about, 1440, and, 1460, movable, type, is, the, system, of, printing, and, typography, using, movable, pieces, of, metal, type, made, by, casting, from, matrices, struck, by, letterpunches, movable, type, allowed, for, much, more, flexible, processes, than, hand, copying, or, block, printing, around, 1040, the, first, known, movable, type, system, was, created, in, china, by, bi, sheng, out, of, porcelain, bi, sheng, used, clay, type, which, broke, easily, but, wang, zhen, by, 1298, had, carved, a, more, durable, type, from, wood, he, also, developed, a, complex, system, of, revolving, tables, and, number, association, with, written, chinese, characters, that, made, typesetting, and, printing, more, efficient, still, the, main, method, in, use, there, remained, woodblock, printing, xylography, which, proved, to, be, cheaper, and, more, efficient, for, printing, chinese, with, its, thousands, of, characters, copper, movable, type, printing, originated, in, china, at, the, beginning, of, the, 12th, century, it, was, used, in, large, scale, printing, of, paper, money, issued, by, the, northern, song, dynasty, movable, type, spread, to, korea, during, the, goryeo, dynasty, around, 1230, koreans, invented, a, metal, type, movable, printing, using, bronze, the, jikji, published, in, 1377, is, the, earliest, known, metal, printed, book, type, casting, was, used, adapted, from, the, method, of, casting, coins, the, character, was, cut, in, beech, wood, which, was, then, pressed, into, a, soft, clay, to, form, a, mould, and, bronze, poured, into, the, mould, and, finally, the, type, was, polished, eastern, metal, movable, type, was, spread, to, europe, between, the, late, 14th, and, early, 15th, centuries, the, korean, form, of, metal, movable, type, was, described, by, the, french, scholar, henri, jean, martin, as, extremely, similar, to, gutenberg, s, authoritative, historians, frances, gies, and, joseph, gies, claimed, that, the, asian, priority, of, invention, movable, type, is, now, firmly, established, and, that, chinese, korean, technique, or, a, report, of, it, traveled, westward, is, almost, certain, around, 1450, johannes, gutenberg, introduced, the, first, movable, type, printing, system, in, europe, he, advanced, innovations, in, casting, type, based, on, a, matrix, and, hand, mould, adaptations, to, the, screw, press, the, use, of, an, oil, based, ink, and, the, creation, of, a, softer, and, more, absorbent, paper, gutenberg, was, the, first, to, create, his, type, pieces, from, an, alloy, of, lead, tin, antimony, copper, and, bismuth, the, same, components, still, used, today, johannes, gutenberg, started, work, on, his, printing, press, around, 1436, in, partnership, with, andreas, dritzehen, whom, he, had, previously, instructed, in, gem, cutting, and, andreas, heilmann, the, owner, of, a, paper, mill, compared, to, woodblock, printing, movable, type, page, setting, and, printing, using, a, press, was, faster, and, more, durable, also, the, metal, type, pieces, were, sturdier, and, the, lettering, more, uniform, leading, to, typography, and, fonts, the, high, quality, and, relatively, low, price, of, the, gutenberg, bible, 1455, established, the, superiority, of, movable, type, for, western, languages, the, printing, press, rapidly, spread, across, europe, leading, up, to, the, renaissance, and, later, all, around, the, world, time, life, magazine, called, gutenberg, s, innovations, in, movable, type, printing, the, most, important, invention, of, the, second, millennium, the, steam, powered, rotary, printing, press, invented, in, 1843, in, the, united, states, by, richard, m, hoe, ultimately, allowed, millions, of, copies, of, a, page, in, a, single, day, mass, production, of, printed, works, flourished, after, the, transition, to, rolled, paper, as, continuous, feed, allowed, the, presses, to, run, at, a, much, faster, pace, hoe, s, original, design, operated, at, up, to, 2, 000, revolutions, per, hour, where, each, revolution, deposited, 4, page, images, giving, the, press, a, throughput, of, 8, 000, pages, per, hour, by, 1891, the, new, york, world, and, philadelphia, item, were, operating, presses, producing, either, 90, 000, 4, page, sheets, per, hour, or, 48, 000, 8, page, sheets, the, rotary, printing, press, uses, impressions, curved, around, a, cylinder, to, print, on, long, continuous, rolls, of, paper, or, other, substrates, rotary, drum, printing, was, later, significantly, improved, by, william, bullock, there, are, multiple, types, of, rotary, printing, press, technologies, that, are, still, used, today, sheetfed, offset, rotogravure, and, flexographic, printing, the, table, lists, the, maximum, number, of, pages, which, various, press, designs, could, print, per, hour, all, printing, process, are, concerned, with, two, kinds, of, areas, on, the, final, output, after, the, information, has, been, prepared, for, production, the, prepress, step, each, printing, process, has, definitive, means, of, separating, the, image, from, the, non, image, areas, conventional, printing, has, four, types, of, process, to, print, an, image, without, a, blank, area, around, the, image, the, non, printing, areas, must, be, trimmed, after, printing, crop, marks, can, be, used, to, show, the, printer, where, the, printing, area, ends, and, the, non, printing, area, begins, the, part, of, the, image, which, is, trimmed, off, is, called, bleed, letterpress, printing, is, a, technique, of, relief, printing, a, worker, composes, and, locks, movable, type, into, the, bed, of, a, press, inks, it, and, presses, paper, against, it, to, transfer, the, ink, from, the, type, which, creates, an, impression, on, the, paper, there, is, different, paper, for, different, works, the, quality, of, paper, shows, different, ink, to, use, letterpress, printing, was, the, normal, form, of, printing, text, from, its, invention, by, johannes, gutenberg, in, the, mid, 15th, century, and, remained, in, wide, use, for, books, and, other, uses, until, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, when, offset, printing, was, developed, more, recently, letterpress, printing, has, seen, a, revival, in, an, artisanal, form, offset, printing, is, a, widely, used, modern, printing, process, this, technology, is, best, described, as, when, a, positive, right, reading, image, on, a, printing, plate, is, inked, and, transferred, or, offset, from, the, plate, to, a, rubber, blanket, the, blanket, image, becomes, a, mirror, image, of, the, plate, image, an, offset, transfer, moves, the, image, to, a, printing, substrate, typically, paper, making, the, image, right, reading, again, offset, printing, uses, a, lithographic, process, which, is, based, on, the, repulsion, of, oil, and, water, the, offset, process, employs, a, flat, planographic, image, carrier, plate, which, is, mounted, on, a, press, cylinder, the, image, to, be, printed, obtains, ink, from, ink, rollers, while, the, non, printing, area, attracts, an, acidic, film, of, water, keeping, the, non, image, areas, ink, free, most, offset, presses, use, three, cylinders, plate, blanket, impression, currently, most, books, and, newspapers, are, printed, using, offset, lithography, gravure, printing, is, an, intaglio, printing, technique, where, the, image, being, printed, is, made, up, of, small, depressions, in, the, surface, of, the, printing, plate, the, cells, are, filled, with, ink, and, the, excess, is, scraped, off, the, surface, with, a, doctor, blade, then, a, rubber, covered, roller, presses, paper, onto, the, surface, of, the, plate, and, into, contact, with, the, ink, in, the, cells, the, printing, cylinders, are, usually, made, from, copper, plated, steel, which, is, subsequently, chromed, and, may, be, produced, by, diamond, engraving, etching, or, laser, ablation, gravure, printing, is, known, for, its, ability, to, produce, high, quality, high, resolution, images, with, accurate, color, reproduction, and, using, viscosity, control, equipment, during, production, ink, evaporation, control, affects, the, change, in, the, color, of, the, printed, image, gravure, printing, is, used, for, long, high, quality, print, runs, such, as, magazines, mail, order, catalogues, packaging, and, printing, onto, fabric, and, wallpaper, it, is, also, used, for, printing, postage, stamps, and, decorative, plastic, laminates, such, as, kitchen, worktops, flexography, is, a, type, of, relief, printing, the, relief, plates, are, typically, made, from, photopolymers, the, process, is, used, for, flexible, packaging, corrugated, board, labels, newspapers, and, more, in, this, market, it, competes, with, gravure, printing, by, holding, 80, of, the, market, in, us, 50, in, europe, but, only, 20, in, asia, the, other, significant, printing, techniques, include, it, is, estimated, that, following, the, innovation, of, gutenberg, s, printing, press, the, european, book, output, rose, from, a, few, million, to, around, one, billion, copies, within, a, span, of, less, than, four, centuries, samuel, hartlib, who, was, exiled, in, britain, and, enthusiastic, about, social, and, cultural, reforms, wrote, in, 1641, that, the, art, of, printing, will, so, spread, knowledge, that, the, common, people, knowing, their, own, rights, and, liberties, will, not, be, governed, by, way, of, oppression, in, the, muslim, world, printing, especially, in, arabic, scripts, was, strongly, opposed, throughout, the, early, modern, period, partially, due, to, the, high, artistic, renown, of, the, art, of, traditional, calligraphy, however, printing, in, hebrew, or, armenian, script, was, often, permitted, thus, the, first, movable, type, printing, in, the, ottoman, empire, was, in, hebrew, in, 1493, after, which, both, religious, and, non, religious, texts, were, able, to, be, printed, in, hebrew, according, to, an, imperial, ambassador, to, istanbul, in, the, middle, of, the, sixteenth, century, it, was, a, sin, for, the, turks, particularly, turkish, muslims, to, print, religious, books, in, 1515, sultan, selim, i, issued, a, decree, under, which, the, practice, of, printing, would, be, punishable, by, death, at, the, end, of, the, sixteenth, century, sultan, murad, iii, permitted, the, sale, of, non, religious, printed, books, in, arabic, characters, yet, the, majority, were, imported, from, italy, ibrahim, muteferrika, established, the, first, press, for, printing, in, arabic, in, the, ottoman, empire, against, opposition, from, the, calligraphers, and, parts, of, the, ulama, it, operated, until, 1742, producing, altogether, seventeen, works, all, of, which, were, concerned, with, non, religious, utilitarian, matters, printing, did, not, become, common, in, the, islamic, world, until, the, 19th, century, hebrew, language, printers, were, banned, from, printing, guilds, in, some, germanic, states, as, a, result, hebrew, printing, flourished, in, italy, beginning, in, 1470, in, rome, then, spreading, to, other, cities, including, bari, pisa, livorno, and, mantua, local, rulers, had, the, authority, to, grant, or, revoke, licenses, to, publish, hebrew, books, and, many, of, those, printed, during, this, period, carry, the, words, con, licenza, de, superiori, indicating, their, printing, having, been, officially, licensed, on, their, title, pages, it, was, thought, that, the, introduction, of, printing, would, strengthen, religion, and, enhance, the, power, of, monarchs, the, majority, of, books, were, of, a, religious, nature, with, the, church, and, crown, regulating, the, content, the, consequences, of, printing, wrong, material, were, extreme, meyrowitz, used, the, example, of, william, carter, who, in, 1584, printed, a, pro, catholic, pamphlet, in, protestant, dominated, england, the, consequence, of, his, action, was, hanging, print, gave, a, broader, range, of, readers, access, to, knowledge, and, enabled, later, generations, to, build, directly, on, the, intellectual, achievements, of, earlier, ones, without, the, changes, arising, within, verbal, traditions, print, according, to, acton, in, his, 1895, lecture, on, the, study, of, history, gave, assurance, that, the, work, of, the, renaissance, would, last, that, what, was, written, would, be, accessible, to, all, that, such, an, occultation, of, knowledge, and, ideas, as, had, depressed, the, middle, ages, would, never, recur, that, not, an, idea, would, be, lost, print, was, instrumental, in, changing, the, social, nature, of, reading, elizabeth, eisenstein, identifies, two, long, term, effects, of, the, invention, of, printing, she, claims, that, print, created, a, sustained, and, uniform, reference, for, knowledge, and, allowed, comparisons, of, incompatible, views, asa, briggs, and, peter, burke, identify, five, kinds, of, reading, that, developed, in, relation, to, the, introduction, of, print, the, invention, of, printing, also, changed, the, occupational, structure, of, european, cities, printers, emerged, as, a, new, group, of, artisans, for, whom, literacy, was, essential, while, the, much, more, labour, intensive, occupation, of, the, scribe, naturally, declined, proof, correcting, arose, as, a, new, occupation, while, a, rise, in, the, numbers, of, booksellers, and, librarians, naturally, followed, the, explosion, in, the, numbers, of, books, gutenberg, s, printing, press, had, profound, impacts, on, universities, as, well, universities, were, influenced, in, their, language, of, scholarship, libraries, curriculum, pedagogy, before, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, most, written, material, was, in, latin, however, after, the, invention, of, printing, the, number, of, books, printed, expanded, as, well, as, the, vernacular, latin, was, not, replaced, completely, but, remained, an, international, language, until, the, eighteenth, century, at, this, time, universities, began, establishing, accompanying, libraries, cambridge, made, the, chaplain, responsible, for, the, library, in, the, fifteenth, century, but, this, position, was, abolished, in, 1570, and, in, 1577, cambridge, established, the, new, office, of, university, librarian, although, the, university, of, leuven, did, not, see, a, need, for, a, university, library, based, on, the, idea, that, professor, were, the, library, libraries, also, began, receiving, so, many, books, from, gifts, and, purchases, that, they, began, to, run, out, of, room, however, the, issue, was, solved, in, 1589, by, a, man, named, merton, who, decided, books, should, be, stored, on, horizontal, shelves, rather, than, lecterns, the, printed, press, changed, university, libraries, in, many, ways, professors, were, finally, able, to, compare, the, opinions, of, different, authors, rather, than, being, forced, to, look, at, only, one, or, two, specific, authors, textbooks, themselves, were, also, being, printed, in, different, levels, of, difficulty, rather, than, just, one, introductory, text, being, made, available, 30, 000, a3, trim, size, web, fed, by, 2005, digital, printing, accounted, for, approximately, 9, of, the, 45, trillion, pages, printed, annually, around, the, world, printing, at, home, an, office, or, an, engineering, environment, is, subdivided, into, some, of, the, more, common, printing, technologies, are, vendors, typically, stress, the, total, cost, to, operate, the, equipment, involving, complex, calculations, that, include, all, cost, factors, involved, in, the, operation, as, well, as, the, capital, equipment, costs, amortization, etc, for, the, most, part, toner, systems, are, more, economical, than, inkjet, in, the, long, run, even, though, inkjets, are, less, expensive, in, the, initial, purchase, price, professional, digital, printing, using, toner, primarily, uses, an, electrical, charge, to, transfer, toner, or, liquid, ink, to, the, substrate, onto, which, it, is, printed, digital, print, quality, has, steadily, improved, from, early, color, and, black, and, white, copiers, to, sophisticated, colour, digital, presses, such, as, the, xerox, igen3, the, kodak, nexpress, the, hp, indigo, digital, press, series, and, the, infoprint, 5000, the, igen3, and, nexpress, use, toner, particles, and, the, indigo, uses, liquid, ink, the, infoprint, 5000, is, a, full, color, continuous, forms, inkjet, drop, on, demand, printing, system, all, handle, variable, data, and, rival, offset, in, quality, digital, offset, presses, are, also, called, direct, imaging, presses, although, these, presses, can, receive, computer, files, and, automatically, turn, them, into, print, ready, plates, they, cannot, insert, variable, data, small, press, and, fanzines, generally, use, digital, printing, prior, to, the, introduction, of, cheap, photocopying, the, use, of, machines, such, as, the, spirit, duplicator, hectograph, and, mimeograph, was, common, 3d, printing, is, a, form, of, manufacturing, technology, where, physical, objects, are, created, from, three, dimensional, digital, models, using, 3d, printers, the, objects, are, created, by, laying, down, or, building, up, many, thin, layers, of, material, in, succession, the, technique, is, also, known, as, additive, manufacturing, rapid, prototyping, or, fabricating, in, the, 1980s, 3d, printing, techniques, were, considered, suitable, only, for, the, production, of, functional, or, aesthetic, prototypes, and, a, more, appropriate, term, for, it, at, the, time, was, rapid, prototyping, as, of, 2019, the, precision, repeatability, and, material, range, of, 3d, printing, have, increased, to, the, point, that, some, 3d, printing, processes, are, considered, viable, as, an, industrial, production, technology, whereby, the, term, additive, manufacturing, can, be, used, synonymously, with, 3d, printing, one, of, the, key, advantages, of, 3d, printing, is, the, ability, to, produce, very, complex, shapes, or, geometries, that, would, be, otherwise, infeasible, to, construct, by, hand, including, hollow, parts, or, parts, with, internal, truss, structures, to, reduce, weight, fused, deposition, modeling, fdm, which, uses, a, continuous, filament, of, a, thermoplastic, material, is, the, most, common, 3d, printing, process, in, use, as, of, 2020, the, classic, manual, of, early, hand, press, technology, is
