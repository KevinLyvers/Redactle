gardening, is, the, process, of, growing, plants, for, their, vegetables, fruits, flowers, herbs, and, appearances, within, a, designated, space, gardens, fulfill, a, wide, assortment, of, purposes, notably, the, production, of, aesthetically, pleasing, areas, medicines, cosmetics, dyes, foods, poisons, wildlife, habitats, and, saleable, goods, see, market, gardening, people, often, partake, in, gardening, for, its, therapeutic, health, educational, cultural, philosophical, environmental, and, religious, benefits, gardening, varies, in, scale, from, the, 800, hectare, versailles, gardens, down, to, container, gardens, grown, inside, gardens, take, many, forms, some, only, contain, one, type, of, plant, while, others, involve, a, complex, assortment, of, plants, with, no, particular, order, gardening, can, be, difficult, to, differentiate, from, farming, they, are, most, easily, differentiated, based, on, their, primary, objectives, farming, prioritizes, saleable, goods, and, may, include, livestock, production, whereas, gardening, often, prioritizes, aesthetics, and, leisure, as, it, pertains, to, food, production, gardening, generally, happens, on, a, much, smaller, scale, with, the, intent, of, personal, or, community, consumption, it, is, important, to, note, that, there, are, cultures, which, do, not, differentiate, between, farming, and, gardening, this, is, primarily, because, subsistence, agriculture, has, been, the, main, method, of, farming, throughout, its, 12, 000, year, history, and, is, virtually, indistinguishable, from, gardening, plant, domestication, is, seen, as, the, birth, of, agriculture, however, it, is, arguably, proceeded, by, a, very, long, history, of, gardening, wild, plants, while, the, 12, 000, year, old, date, is, the, commonly, accepted, timeline, describing, plant, domestication, there, is, now, evidence, from, the, ohalo, ii, hunter, gatherer, site, showing, earlier, signs, of, disturbing, the, soil, and, cultivation, of, pre, domesticated, crop, species, this, evidence, pushes, early, stage, plant, domestication, to, 23, 000, years, ago, which, aligns, with, research, done, by, allaby, 2022, showing, slight, selection, pressure, of, desirable, traits, in, southwest, asian, cereals, einkorn, emmer, barley, despite, not, qualifying, as, plant, domestication, there, are, many, archaeological, studies, pushing, the, potential, date, of, hominin, selective, ecosystem, disturbance, back, up, to, 125, 000, years, ago, much, of, these, early, recorded, ecosystem, disturbances, were, made, through, hominin, use, of, fire, which, dates, back, to, 1, 5, mya, although, at, this, time, fire, was, not, likely, being, wielded, as, a, landscape, changing, tool, by, hominids, this, anthropogenic, ecosystem, disturbance, may, be, the, origins, of, gardening, every, hunter, gatherer, society, has, developed, a, niche, of, some, sort, allowing, them, to, thrive, or, even, just, survive, amongst, their, environments, many, of, these, prehistoric, hunter, gatherers, had, constructed, a, niche, allowing, for, easier, access, to, or, a, higher, amount, of, edible, plant, species, this, shift, from, hunting, and, gathering, to, increasingly, modifying, the, environment, in, a, way, which, produces, an, abundance, of, edible, plant, species, marks, the, beginning, of, gardening, one, of, the, most, documented, hominin, niches, is, the, use, of, off, site, fire, when, done, intentionally, this, is, often, called, forest, gardening, or, fire, stick, farming, in, australia, the, modern, study, of, fire, ecology, describes, the, many, benefits, off, site, fires, may, have, granted, these, early, humans, some, of, these, agroecological, practices, have, been, well, documented, and, studied, during, colonial, contact, however, they, are, vastly, under, represented, in, research, done, on, early, hominin, fire, use, based, on, current, research, it, is, evident, that, these, niches, developed, separately, in, different, societies, across, different, times, and, locations, many, of, the, indigenous, gardening, methods, were, and, still, are, often, overlooked, by, colonizers, due, to, the, lack, of, resemblance, to, western, gardens, with, well, defined, borders, and, non, naturalized, plant, species, there, are, long, traditions, of, gardening, within, indigenous, societies, spanning, from, the, northernmost, parts, of, canada, down, to, the, southernmost, tip, of, chile, and, argentina, the, arctic, and, subarctic, societies, relied, primarily, on, hunting, and, fishing, due, to, the, harsh, climate, although, they, have, been, known, to, collectively, use, at, least, 311, different, plants, as, foods, or, medicines, the, substantial, knowledge, and, use, of, these, plants, along, with, the, communal, harvesting, sites, and, emphasis, on, reciprocity, between, humans, and, plants, indicates, a, basic, level, of, gardening, similarly, the, fuegian, indigenous, groups, in, south, america, had, developed, seemingly, comparable, niches, due, to, a, similar, tundra, ecosystem, while, there, are, very, few, studies, on, the, fuegians, darwin, mentioned, wild, edible, plants, such, as, fungi, kelp, and, wild, celery, growing, next, to, the, various, fuegian, shelters, horticulture, plays, a, relatively, small, role, in, these, northern, and, southern, tundra, inhabitants, compared, with, indigenous, societies, in, grassland, and, forest, ecosystems, from, the, boreal, forests, of, canada, to, the, temperate, forests, and, grasslands, of, chile, and, argentina, different, communities, have, developed, food, production, niches, these, include, the, use, of, fire, for, ecosystem, maintenance, and, resetting, successional, sequences, the, sowing, of, wild, annuals, the, sowing, of, domesticated, annuals, e, g, three, sisters, new, world, crops, creating, berry, patches, and, orchards, manipulation, of, plants, to, encourage, desired, traits, e, g, increased, nut, fruit, or, root, production, and, landscape, modification, to, encourage, plant, and, animal, growth, e, g, complex, irrigation, or, terraces, these, modified, landscapes, as, recorded, by, early, american, philosophers, such, as, thoreau, and, emmerson, were, described, as, exhibiting, pristine, beauty, indigenous, gardens, such, as, forest, gardens, therefore, do, not, only, serve, as, a, producer, of, foods, medicines, or, materials, but, also, pleasant, aesthetics, many, popular, crops, originate, from, pre, colonial, indigenous, agricultural, societies, some, of, these, include, maize, quinoa, common, bean, peanut, pumpkin, squash, pepper, tomato, cassava, potato, blueberry, cactus, pear, cashew, papaya, pineapple, strawberry, cacao, sunflower, cotton, par, rubber, and, tobacco, forest, gardening, a, forest, based, food, production, system, is, the, world, s, oldest, form, of, gardening, after, the, emergence, of, the, first, civilizations, wealthy, individuals, began, to, create, gardens, for, aesthetic, purposes, ancient, egyptian, tomb, paintings, from, the, new, kingdom, around, 1500, bc, provide, some, of, the, earliest, physical, evidence, of, ornamental, horticulture, and, landscape, design, they, depict, lotus, ponds, surrounded, by, symmetrical, rows, of, acacias, and, palms, a, notable, example, of, ancient, ornamental, gardens, were, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, while, ancient, rome, had, dozens, of, gardens, wealthy, ancient, egyptians, used, gardens, for, providing, shade, egyptians, associated, trees, and, gardens, with, gods, believing, that, their, deities, were, pleased, by, gardens, gardens, in, ancient, egypt, were, often, surrounded, by, walls, with, trees, planted, in, rows, among, the, most, popular, species, planted, were, date, palms, sycamores, fig, trees, nut, trees, and, willows, these, gardens, were, a, sign, of, higher, socioeconomic, status, in, addition, wealthy, ancient, egyptians, grew, vineyards, as, wine, was, a, sign, of, the, higher, social, classes, roses, poppies, daisies, and, irises, could, all, also, be, found, in, the, gardens, of, the, egyptians, assyria, was, renowned, for, its, beautiful, gardens, these, tended, to, be, wide, and, large, some, of, them, used, for, hunting, game, rather, like, a, game, reserve, today, and, others, as, leisure, gardens, cypresses, and, palms, were, some, of, the, most, frequently, planted, types, of, trees, gardens, were, also, available, in, kush, in, musawwarat, es, sufra, the, great, enclosure, dated, to, the, 3rd, century, bc, included, splendid, gardens, ancient, roman, gardens, were, laid, out, with, hedges, and, vines, and, contained, a, wide, variety, of, flowers, acanthus, cornflowers, crocus, cyclamen, hyacinth, iris, ivy, lavender, lilies, myrtle, narcissus, poppy, rosemary, and, violets, as, well, as, statues, and, sculptures, flower, beds, were, popular, in, the, courtyards, of, rich, romans, the, middle, ages, represent, a, period, of, decline, in, gardens, for, aesthetic, purposes, after, the, fall, of, rome, gardening, was, done, for, the, purpose, of, growing, medicinal, herbs, and, or, decorating, church, altars, monasteries, carried, on, a, tradition, of, garden, design, and, intense, horticultural, techniques, during, the, medieval, period, in, europe, generally, monastic, garden, types, consisted, of, kitchen, gardens, infirmary, gardens, cemetery, orchards, cloister, garths, and, vineyards, individual, monasteries, might, also, have, had, a, green, court, a, plot, of, grass, and, trees, where, horses, could, graze, as, well, as, a, cellarer, s, garden, or, private, gardens, for, obedientiaries, monks, who, held, specific, posts, within, the, monastery, islamic, gardens, were, built, after, the, model, of, persian, gardens, and, they, were, usually, enclosed, by, walls, and, divided, in, four, by, watercourses, commonly, the, centre, of, the, garden, would, have, a, reflecting, pool, or, pavilion, specific, to, the, islamic, gardens, are, the, mosaics, and, glazed, tiles, used, to, decorate, the, rills, and, fountains, that, were, built, in, these, gardens, by, the, late, 13th, century, rich, europeans, began, to, grow, gardens, for, leisure, and, for, medicinal, herbs, and, vegetables, they, surrounded, the, gardens, by, walls, to, protect, them, from, animals, and, to, provide, seclusion, during, the, next, two, centuries, europeans, started, planting, lawns, and, raising, flowerbeds, and, trellises, of, roses, fruit, trees, were, common, in, these, gardens, and, also, in, some, there, were, turf, seats, at, the, same, time, the, gardens, in, the, monasteries, were, a, place, to, grow, flowers, and, medicinal, herbs, but, they, were, also, a, space, where, the, monks, could, enjoy, nature, and, relax, the, gardens, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, were, symmetric, proportioned, and, balanced, with, a, more, classical, appearance, most, of, these, gardens, were, built, around, a, central, axis, and, they, were, divided, into, different, parts, by, hedges, commonly, gardens, had, flowerbeds, laid, out, in, squares, and, separated, by, gravel, paths, gardens, in, renaissance, were, adorned, with, sculptures, topiary, and, fountains, in, the, 17th, century, knot, gardens, became, popular, along, with, the, hedge, mazes, by, this, time, europeans, started, planting, new, flowers, such, as, tulips, marigolds, and, sunflowers, cottage, gardens, which, emerged, in, elizabethan, times, appear, to, have, originated, as, a, local, source, for, herbs, and, fruits, one, theory, is, that, they, arose, out, of, the, black, death, of, the, 1340s, when, the, death, of, so, many, laborers, made, land, available, for, small, cottages, with, personal, gardens, according, to, the, late, 19th, century, legend, of, origin, these, gardens, were, originally, created, by, the, workers, that, lived, in, the, cottages, of, the, villages, to, provide, them, with, food, and, herbs, with, flowers, planted, among, them, for, decoration, farm, workers, were, provided, with, cottages, that, had, architectural, quality, set, in, a, small, garden, about, 1, acre, 0, 40, hectares, where, they, could, grow, food, and, keep, pigs, and, chickens, authentic, gardens, of, the, yeoman, cottager, would, have, included, a, beehive, and, livestock, and, frequently, a, pig, and, sty, along, with, a, well, the, peasant, cottager, of, medieval, times, was, more, interested, in, meat, than, flowers, with, herbs, grown, for, medicinal, use, rather, than, for, their, beauty, by, elizabethan, times, there, was, more, prosperity, and, thus, more, room, to, grow, flowers, even, the, early, cottage, garden, flowers, typically, had, their, practical, use, violets, were, spread, on, the, floor, for, their, pleasant, scent, and, keeping, out, vermin, calendulas, and, primroses, were, both, attractive, and, used, in, cooking, others, such, as, sweet, william, and, hollyhocks, were, grown, entirely, for, their, beauty, in, the, 18th, century, gardens, were, laid, out, more, naturally, without, any, walls, this, style, of, smooth, undulating, grass, which, would, run, straight, to, the, house, clumps, belts, and, scattering, of, trees, and, serpentine, lakes, formed, by, invisibly, damming, small, rivers, were, a, new, style, within, the, english, landscape, this, was, a, gardenless, form, of, landscape, gardening, which, swept, away, almost, all, the, remnants, of, previous, formally, patterned, styles, the, english, landscape, garden, usually, included, a, lake, lawns, set, against, groves, of, trees, and, often, contained, shrubberies, grottoes, pavilions, bridges, and, follies, such, as, mock, temples, gothic, ruins, bridges, and, other, picturesque, architecture, designed, to, recreate, an, idyllic, pastoral, landscape, this, new, style, emerged, in, england, in, the, early, 18th, century, and, spread, across, europe, replacing, the, more, formal, symmetrical, garden, la, fran, aise, of, the, 17th, century, as, the, principal, gardening, style, of, europe, the, english, garden, presented, an, idealized, view, of, nature, they, were, often, inspired, by, paintings, of, landscapes, by, claude, lorraine, and, nicolas, poussin, and, some, were, influenced, by, the, classic, chinese, gardens, of, the, east, which, had, recently, been, described, by, european, travelers, the, work, of, lancelot, capability, brown, was, particularly, influential, also, in, 1804, the, horticultural, society, was, formed, gardens, of, the, 19th, century, contained, plants, such, as, the, monkey, puzzle, or, chile, pine, this, is, also, the, time, when, the, so, called, gardenesque, style, of, gardens, evolved, these, gardens, displayed, a, wide, variety, of, flowers, in, a, rather, small, space, rock, gardens, increased, in, popularity, in, the, 19th, century, in, ancient, india, patterns, from, sacred, geometry, and, mandalas, were, used, to, design, gardens, distinct, mandala, patterns, denoted, specific, deities, planets, or, even, constellations, such, a, garden, was, also, referred, to, as, a, mandala, vaatika, the, word, vaatika, can, mean, garden, plantation, or, parterre, residential, gardening, takes, place, near, the, home, in, a, space, referred, to, as, the, garden, although, a, garden, typically, is, located, on, the, land, near, a, residence, it, may, also, be, located, on, a, roof, in, an, atrium, on, a, balcony, in, a, window, box, on, a, patio, or, vivarium, gardening, also, takes, place, in, non, residential, green, areas, such, as, parks, public, or, semi, public, gardens, botanical, gardens, or, zoological, gardens, amusement, parks, along, transportation, corridors, and, around, tourist, attractions, and, garden, hotels, in, these, situations, a, staff, of, gardeners, or, groundskeepers, maintains, the, gardens, regardless, of, historical, time, period, location, scale, or, type, of, garden, all, gardening, requires, some, basic, tools, for, the, majority, of, human, history, people, have, managed, with, significantly, fewer, resources, compared, to, modern, times, agriculture, was, built, on, the, use, of, hands, stones, sticks, human, ingenuity, and, fire, the, essential, tools, used, in, pre, bronze, age, gardening, were, non, metal, primarily, stone, bone, wood, or, copper, knives, axes, adzes, foot, ploughs, sickles, hoes, baskets, pottery, digging, sticks, animal, driven, ploughs, animals, and, fire, for, clearing, land, up, until, the, green, revolution, these, simple, tools, although, continually, improved, upon, would, continue, to, be, the, backbone, of, agricultural, societies, the, industrial, revolution, created, a, large, increase, in, availability, and, impact, of, agricultural, tools, these, tools, include, tractors, with, modern, implements, manure, spreaders, cultivators, mowers, earth, moving, machines, hedge, trimmers, strimmer, s, wood, chippers, two, wheel, tractors, complex, irrigation, systems, plastic, mulch, plastic, shelters, seeding, trays, indoor, grow, lights, packaging, chemical, fertilizers, pesticides, genetically, modified, seeds, and, many, more, plants, may, be, propagated, through, many, different, methods, these, methods, are, classified, as, either, sexual, or, asexual, propagation, asexual, reproduction, occurs, when, plants, produce, clonal, offspring, this, method, of, reproduction, is, often, more, simplistic, and, provides, rapid, population, growth, cloning, may, result, in, highly, vulnerable, plant, populations, if, they, do, not, also, reproduce, sexually, in, order, to, create, genetic, diversity, thus, allowing, for, certain, levels, of, natural, selection, and, hybrid, vigor, there, are, various, methods, of, asexual, plant, propagation, taken, advantage, of, by, gardeners, these, include, vegetative, propagation, which, involves, the, growth, of, new, plants, from, vegetative, parts, of, the, parent, plant, such, as, roots, stems, and, leaves, certain, plants, such, as, strawberries, and, raspberries, produce, stolons, or, rhizomes, which, are, stems, which, grow, horizontally, above, or, below, ground, developing, new, plants, at, nodes, another, common, method, of, asexual, reproduction, in, garden, plants, is, fragmentation, which, involves, a, separation, from, the, parent, plant, this, is, common, for, shrubs, and, trees, such, as, willows, which, may, shed, their, branches, which, is, termed, cladoptosis, placing, the, shed, limb, into, water, or, soil, produces, budding, and, causes, roots, to, form, perhaps, the, most, commonly, known, method, of, asexual, reproduction, in, gardening, and, farming, is, grafting, a, human, may, chose, to, graft, an, excellent, fruit, producing, cultivar, on, a, selected, rootstock, cultivar, of, the, same, species, this, involves, cutting, each, plant, and, connecting, the, cuttings, by, mechanical, means, until, they, inosculate, or, fuse, together, grafting, is, done, for, many, purposes, firstly, the, scion, portion, of, the, plant, above, the, graft, site, can, undergo, artificial, selection, for, specific, desirable, traits, such, as, flavor, while, the, rootstock, can, undergo, selection, for, traits, such, as, disease, resistance, or, cold, tolerance, this, effectively, allows, for, much, more, efficiency, in, the, artificial, selection, process, as, certain, traits, such, as, fruit, taste, can, be, ignored, altogether, in, the, rootstock, allowing, for, a, focused, selection, with, less, backcrossing, to, a, plant, that, had, good, tasting, fruit, secondly, grafting, allows, for, plants, that, require, cross, pollination, for, fruit, generation, such, as, apples, to, all, grow, together, as, one, tree, thirdly, this, allows, for, quick, reproduction, where, one, mother, plant, can, produce, many, semi, developed, clones, each, year, sexual, reproduction, occurs, through, the, pollination, of, a, ovule, this, pollination, must, occur, between, female, and, male, parts, of, a, single, flower, or, between, flowers, a, plant, may, undergo, self, pollination, as, a, sexual, means, of, reproduction, where, the, genes, of, the, mother, plant, will, not, perfectly, match, those, of, the, progeny, progeny, from, self, pollination, will, however, have, less, genetic, diversity, which, may, result, in, inbreeding, depression, versus, plants, from, cross, pollination, pollen, is, typically, carried, by, wind, insects, or, animals, to, complete, pollination, some, greenhouses, may, have, to, manually, pollinate, their, plants, to, produce, fruit, and, seeds, due, to, a, lack, of, these, conditions, sexual, reproduction, can, only, be, done, by, members, of, the, same, species, and, this, produces, varying, levels, of, genetic, diversity, in, the, plants, offspring, this, genetic, diversity, is, responsible, for, the, survival, of, every, plant, as, we, know, them, today, the, diversity, allows, for, disease, resistance, adaptations, to, changing, climate, changes, in, soil, changes, in, pollination, methods, changes, in, animal, grazing, pressure, changes, in, weed, pressure, and, any, other, variations, that, arise, in, their, growing, conditions, crossing, plants, or, hybridizing, results, in, hybrid, vigor, and, will, increase, the, genetic, diversity, many, commercially, grown, plants, are, f1, hybrids, which, ensures, certain, desirable, traits, a, common, alternative, to, growing, hybrid, plants, is, to, grow, heirloom, or, open, pollinated, plants, which, unlike, f1, hybrids, will, produce, viable, seed, with, progeny, similar, to, its, parent, many, modern, gardeners, will, save, seeds, from, heirloom, varieties, but, not, hybrids, due, to, the, certainty, of, desirable, traits, heirloom, seeds, provide, historically, a, lack, of, plant, breeding, knowledge, would, have, led, to, more, hybridization, and, the, creation, of, new, genetically, diverse, landraces, each, plant, varies, in, its, likelihood, of, outcrossing, highly, outcrossing, plants, such, as, spinach, are, more, likely, to, create, landraces, many, landraces, and, heirloom, varieties, along, with, their, genetics, are, being, lost, due, to, the, decrease, in, seed, saving, by, modern, farmers, this, leads, plant, geneticists, to, search, for, desirable, genetics, in, wild, ancestral, varieties, of, commonly, grown, plants, plants, have, been, artificially, selected, and, bred, since, at, least, 7800, bce, despite, the, decrease, in, farmer, seed, saving, many, landraces, are, also, being, created, through, artificial, selection, and, genetic, modification, gardeners, remain, vital, in, the, preservation, of, diverse, genetics, whether, they, maintain, a, family, heirloom, variety, bred, to, fit, conditions, from, the, distant, past, or, they, breed, new, landraces, with, traits, matching, their, modern, climate, and, growing, condition, certain, seeds, may, not, sprout, without, certain, environmental, conditions, these, seeds, either, require, scarification, or, stratification, gardeners, may, grow, frustrated, if, they, lack, this, crucial, knowledge, before, attempting, to, propagate, certain, plants, such, as, hard, neck, garlic, asexual, reproduction, which, requires, a, cold, dormant, period, to, sprout, or, saskatoon, berries, which, have, improved, germination, after, being, digested, by, bears, through, a, process, called, endozoochory, many, gardeners, especially, those, who, live, in, colder, climates, will, start, seeds, indoors, prior, to, transplanting, the, young, plant, outside, this, provides, many, benefits, such, as, elongating, the, growing, season, ensuring, adequate, quantities, and, quality, of, light, ensuring, seedlings, have, adequate, nutrients, in, the, seed, starting, mix, ensuring, seeds, stay, at, correct, humidity, heat, and, moisture, level, for, germination, and, saving, space, in, the, garden, many, crops, will, not, be, harvestable, unless, they, are, started, inside, so, if, a, gardener, wants, to, plant, these, crops, in, their, garden, without, starting, the, plants, themselves, they, will, need, to, purchase, transplants, which, are, commonly, available, at, garden, centers, plant, nurseries, and, big, box, stores, it, is, crucial, that, transplanting, is, done, correctly, this, generally, implies, providing, the, plants, with, enough, soil, so, they, do, not, become, root, bound, roots, wrapping, in, circles, around, transplant, container, providing, a, hardening, off, period, slow, exposure, to, sun, wind, and, cold, providing, sufficient, light, water, and, nutrients, and, choosing, the, correct, plants, to, start, indoors, as, some, plants, do, not, do, well, with, the, transplanting, process, there, are, varying, methods, of, starting, your, seeds, the, most, prevalent, method, would, be, to, start, seeds, in, transplant, plug, trays, or, in, planters, pots, another, method, is, starting, seeds, in, soil, blocks, small, cubes, of, compressed, potting, soil, compost, and, or, other, seed, starting, media, which, may, reduce, transplant, shock, and, stop, root, binding, because, they, allow, air, pruning, of, the, roots, some, plants, such, as, onions, and, various, herbs, may, be, efficiently, started, by, scattering, their, seeds, on, top, of, soil, in, a, large, tray, where, the, seedlings, will, later, be, teased, apart, from, each, other, and, replanted, in, the, garden, or, pots, garden, pests, are, generally, plants, fungi, or, animals, frequently, insects, that, engage, in, activity, that, the, gardener, considers, undesirable, a, pest, may, crowd, out, desirable, plants, disturb, soil, stunt, the, growth, of, young, seedlings, steal, or, damage, fruit, or, otherwise, kill, plants, hamper, their, growth, damage, their, appearance, or, reduce, the, quality, of, the, edible, or, ornamental, portions, of, the, plant, aphids, spider, mites, slugs, snails, ants, birds, and, even, cats, are, commonly, considered, to, be, garden, pests, throughout, history, ecosystems, that, have, undergone, rapid, changes, are, typically, those, which, harbor, the, most, pests, for, example, a, highly, and, rapidly, altered, landscape, such, as, modern, canola, fields, in, the, americas, can, be, a, breeding, ground, for, pests, of, the, brassicaceae, family, a, natural, ecosystem, will, typically, regulate, pest, levels, through, many, biological, means, whether, that, be, the, natural, introduction, of, a, disease, or, an, increase, in, the, population, of, a, predator, species, of, animal, because, gardeners, may, have, different, goals, organisms, considered, garden, pests, vary, from, gardener, to, gardener, tropaeolum, speciosum, for, example, may, be, considered, a, desirable, and, ornamental, garden, plant, or, it, may, be, considered, a, pest, if, it, seeds, and, starts, to, grow, where, it, is, not, wanted, as, another, example, in, lawns, moss, can, become, dominant, and, be, impossible, to, eradicate, in, some, lawns, lichens, especially, very, damp, lawn, lichens, such, as, peltigera, lactucfolia, and, p, membranacea, can, become, difficult, to, control, and, are, considered, pests, there, are, many, ways, by, which, unwanted, pests, are, removed, from, a, garden, the, techniques, vary, depending, on, the, pest, the, gardener, s, goals, and, the, gardener, s, philosophy, for, example, snails, may, be, dealt, with, through, the, use, of, a, chemical, pesticide, an, organic, pesticide, hand, picking, barriers, or, simply, growing, snail, resistant, plants, on, a, large, scale, pest, control, is, often, done, through, the, use, of, pesticides, and, herbicides, which, may, be, either, organic, or, artificially, synthesized, pesticides, may, affect, the, ecology, of, a, garden, due, to, their, effects, on, the, populations, of, both, target, and, non, target, species, for, example, unintended, exposure, to, some, neonicotinoid, pesticides, has, been, proposed, as, a, factor, in, the, recent, decline, in, honey, bee, populations, pesticides, and, herbicides, are,

herbicides, they, are, often, under, informed, or, accept, the, consequences, due, to, financial, necessity, fungicides, may, be, applied, to, the, seed, coat, to, reduce, mortality, of, germinating, seedlings, the, improper, use, of, pesticides, often, leads, to, pesticide, resistance, which, poses, a, risk, in, global, food, security, with, climate, change, affecting, the, distribution, of, pests, a, global, increase, in, pesticide, usage, has, been, observed, which, in, turn, has, caused, an, increase, of, human, health, risks, due, to, exposure, creating, new, pesticides, in, order, to, manage, resistant, organisms, is, an, immense, expense, and, is, often, heavily, criticized, as, an, ineffective, method, of, pest, control, other, means, of, control, include, the, removal, of, infected, plants, using, fertilizers, and, bio, stimulants, to, improve, the, health, and, vigor, of, plants, so, they, better, resist, attack, practicing, crop, rotation, to, prevent, pest, build, up, using, foliar, sprays, companion, planting, and, practicing, good, garden, hygiene, such, as, disinfecting, tools, and, clearing, debris, and, weeds, which, may, harbor, pests, another, common,
