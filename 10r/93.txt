random, access, memory, ram, r, m, is, a, form, of, electronic, computer, memory, that, can, be, read, and, changed, in, any, order, typically, used, to, store, working, data, and, machine, code, a, random, access, memory, device, allows, data, items, to, be, read, or, written, in, almost, the, same, amount, of, time, irrespective, of, the, physical, location, of, data, inside, the, memory, in, contrast, with, other, direct, access, data, storage, media, such, as, hard, disks, and, magnetic, tape, where, the, time, required, to, read, and, write, data, items, varies, significantly, depending, on, their, physical, locations, on, the, recording, medium, due, to, mechanical, limitations, such, as, media, rotation, speeds, and, arm, movement, in, today, s, technology, random, access, memory, takes, the, form, of, integrated, circuit, ic, chips, with, mos, metal, oxide, semiconductor, memory, cells, ram, is, normally, associated, with, volatile, types, of, memory, where, stored, information, is, lost, if, power, is, removed, the, two, main, types, of, volatile, random, access, semiconductor, memory, are, static, random, access, memory, sram, and, dynamic, random, access, memory, dram, non, volatile, ram, has, also, been, developed, and, other, types, of, non, volatile, memories, allow, random, access, for, read, operations, but, either, do, not, allow, write, operations, or, have, other, kinds, of, limitations, these, include, most, types, of, rom, and, nor, flash, memory, the, use, of, semiconductor, ram, dates, back, to, 1965, when, ibm, introduced, the, monolithic, single, chip, 16, bit, sp95, sram, chip, for, their, system, 360, model, 95, computer, and, toshiba, used, bipolar, dram, memory, cells, for, its, 180, bit, toscal, bc, 1411, electronic, calculator, both, based, on, bipolar, transistors, while, it, offered, higher, speeds, than, magnetic, core, memory, bipolar, dram, could, not, compete, with, the, lower, price, of, the, then, dominant, magnetic, core, memory, in, 1966, dr, robert, dennard, invented, modern, dram, architecture, in, which, there, s, a, single, mos, transistor, per, capacitor, the, first, commercial, dram, ic, chip, the, 1k, intel, 1103, was, introduced, in, october, 1970, synchronous, dynamic, random, access, memory, sdram, was, reintroduced, with, the, samsung, km48sl2000, chip, in, 1992, early, computers, used, relays, mechanical, counters, or, delay, lines, for, main, memory, functions, ultrasonic, delay, lines, were, serial, devices, which, could, only, reproduce, data, in, the, order, it, was, written, drum, memory, could, be, expanded, at, relatively, low, cost, but, efficient, retrieval, of, memory, items, requires, knowledge, of, the, physical, layout, of, the, drum, to, optimize, speed, latches, built, out, of, triode, vacuum, tubes, and, later, out, of, discrete, transistors, were, used, for, smaller, and, faster, memories, such, as, registers, such, registers, were, relatively, large, and, too, costly, to, use, for, large, amounts, of, data, generally, only, a, few, dozen, or, few, hundred, bits, of, such, memory, could, be, provided, the, first, practical, form, of, random, access, memory, was, the, williams, tube, it, stored, data, as, electrically, charged, spots, on, the, face, of, a, cathode, ray, tube, since, the, electron, beam, of, the, crt, could, read, and, write, the, spots, on, the, tube, in, any, order, memory, was, random, access, the, capacity, of, the, williams, tube, was, a, few, hundred, to, around, a, thousand, bits, but, it, was, much, smaller, faster, and, more, power, efficient, than, using, individual, vacuum, tube, latches, developed, at, the, university, of, manchester, in, england, the, williams, tube, provided, the, medium, on, which, the, first, electronically, stored, program, was, implemented, in, the, manchester, baby, computer, which, first, successfully, ran, a, program, on, 21, june, 1948, in, fact, rather, than, the, williams, tube, memory, being, designed, for, the, baby, the, baby, was, a, testbed, to, demonstrate, the, reliability, of, the, memory, magnetic, core, memory, was, invented, in, 1947, and, developed, up, until, the, mid, 1970s, it, became, a, widespread, form, of, random, access, memory, relying, on, an, array, of, magnetized, rings, by, changing, the, sense, of, each, ring, s, magnetization, data, could, be, stored, with, one, bit, stored, per, ring, since, every, ring, had, a, combination, of, address, wires, to, select, and, read, or, write, it, access, to, any, memory, location, in, any, sequence, was, possible, magnetic, core, memory, was, the, standard, form, of, computer, memory, system, until, displaced, by, solid, state, mos, metal, oxide, silicon, semiconductor, memory, in, integrated, circuits, ics, during, the, early, 1970s, prior, to, the, development, of, integrated, read, only, memory, rom, circuits, permanent, or, read, only, random, access, memory, was, often, constructed, using, diode, matrices, driven, by, address, decoders, or, specially, wound, core, rope, memory, planes, semiconductor, memory, began, in, the, 1960s, with, bipolar, memory, which, used, bipolar, transistors, although, it, was, faster, it, could, not, compete, with, the, lower, price, of, magnetic, core, memory, in, 1957, frosch, and, derick, were, able, to, manufacture, the, first, silicon, dioxide, field, effect, transistors, at, bell, labs, the, first, transistors, in, which, drain, and, source, were, adjacent, at, the, surface, subsequently, a, team, demonstrated, a, working, mosfet, at, bell, labs, 1960, this, led, to, the, development, of, metal, oxide, semiconductor, mos, memory, by, john, schmidt, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1964, in, addition, to, higher, speeds, mos, semiconductor, memory, was, cheaper, and, consumed, less, power, than, magnetic, core, memory, the, development, of, silicon, gate, mos, integrated, circuit, mos, ic, technology, by, federico, faggin, at, fairchild, in, 1968, enabled, the, production, of, mos, memory, chips, mos, memory, overtook, magnetic, core, memory, as, the, dominant, memory, technology, in, the, early, 1970s, integrated, bipolar, static, random, access, memory, sram, was, invented, by, robert, h, norman, at, fairchild, semiconductor, in, 1963, it, was, followed, by, the, development, of, mos, sram, by, john, schmidt, at, fairchild, in, 1964, sram, became, an, alternative, to, magnetic, core, memory, but, required, six, mos, transistors, for, each, bit, of, data, commercial, use, of, sram, began, in, 1965, when, ibm, introduced, the, sp95, memory, chip, for, the, system, 360, model, 95, dynamic, random, access, memory, dram, allowed, replacement, of, a, 4, or, 6, transistor, latch, circuit, by, a, single, transistor, for, each, memory, bit, greatly, increasing, memory, density, at, the, cost, of, volatility, data, was, stored, in, the, tiny, capacitance, of, each, transistor, and, had, to, be, periodically, refreshed, every, few, milliseconds, before, the, charge, could, leak, away, toshiba, s, toscal, bc, 1411, electronic, calculator, which, was, introduced, in, 1965, used, a, form, of, capacitor, bipolar, dram, storing, 180, bit, data, on, discrete, memory, cells, consisting, of, germanium, bipolar, transistors, and, capacitors, while, it, offered, higher, speeds, than, magnetic, core, memory, bipolar, dram, could, not, compete, with, the, lower, price, of, the, then, dominant, magnetic, core, memory, capacitors, had, also, been, used, for, earlier, memory, schemes, such, as, the, drum, of, the, atanasoff, berry, computer, the, williams, tube, and, the, selectron, tube, in, 1966, dr, robert, dennard, invented, invented, modern, dram, architecture, for, which, there, s, a, single, mos, transistor, per, capacitor, while, examining, the, characteristics, of, mos, technology, he, found, it, was, capable, of, building, capacitors, and, that, storing, a, charge, or, no, charge, on, the, mos, capacitor, could, represent, the, 1, and, 0, of, a, bit, while, the, mos, transistor, could, control, writing, the, charge, to, the, capacitor, this, led, to, his, development, of, a, single, transistor, dram, memory, cell, in, 1967, dennard, filed, a, patent, under, ibm, for, a, single, transistor, dram, memory, cell, based, on, mos, technology, the, first, commercial, dram, ic, chip, was, the, intel, 1103, which, was, manufactured, on, an, 8, m, mos, process, with, a, capacity, of, 1, kbit, and, was, released, in, 1970, the, earliest, drams, were, often, synchronized, with, the, cpu, clock, clocked, and, were, used, with, early, microprocessors, in, the, mid, 1970s, drams, moved, to, the, asynchronous, design, but, in, the, 1990s, returned, to, synchronous, operation, in, 1992, samsung, released, km48sl2000, which, had, a, capacity, of, 16, mbit, and, mass, produced, in, 1993, the, first, commercial, ddr, sdram, double, data, rate, sdram, memory, chip, was, samsung, s, 64, mbit, ddr, sdram, chip, released, in, june, 1998, gddr, graphics, ddr, is, a, form, of, ddr, sgram, synchronous, graphics, ram, which, was, first, released, by, samsung, as, a, 16, mbit, memory, chip, in, 1998, the, two, widely, used, forms, of, modern, ram, are, static, ram, sram, and, dynamic, ram, dram, in, sram, a, bit, of, data, is, stored, using, the, state, of, a, six, transistor, memory, cell, typically, using, six, mosfets, this, form, of, ram, is, more, expensive, to, produce, but, is, generally, faster, and, requires, less, dynamic, power, than, dram, in, modern, computers, sram, is, often, used, as, cache, memory, for, the, cpu, dram, stores, a, bit, of, data, using, a, transistor, and, capacitor, pair, typically, a, mosfet, and, mos, capacitor, respectively, which, together, comprise, a, dram, cell, the, capacitor, holds, a, high, or, low, charge, 1, or, 0, respectively, and, the, transistor, acts, as, a, switch, that, lets, the, control, circuitry, on, the, chip, read, the, capacitor, s, state, of, charge, or, change, it, as, this, form, of, memory, is, less, expensive, to, produce, than, static, ram, it, is, the, predominant, form, of, computer, memory, used, in, modern, computers, both, static, and, dynamic, ram, are, considered, volatile, as, their, state, is, lost, or, reset, when, power, is, removed, from, the, system, by, contrast, read, only, memory, rom, stores, data, by, permanently, enabling, or, disabling, selected, transistors, such, that, the, memory, cannot, be, altered, writable, variants, of, rom, such, as, eeprom, and, nor, flash, share, properties, of, both, rom, and, ram, enabling, data, to, persist, without, power, and, to, be, updated, without, requiring, special, equipment, ecc, memory, which, can, be, either, sram, or, dram, includes, special, circuitry, to, detect, and, or, correct, random, faults, memory, errors, in, the, stored, data, using, parity, bits, or, error, correction, codes, in, general, the, term, ram, refers, solely, to, solid, state, memory, devices, either, dram, or, sram, and, more, specifically, the, main, memory, in, most, computers, in, optical, storage, the, term, dvd, ram, is, somewhat, of, a, misnomer, since, it, is, not, random, access, it, behaves, much, like, a, hard, disc, drive, if, somewhat, slower, aside, unlike, cd, rw, or, dvd, rw, dvd, ram, does, not, need, to, be, erased, before, reuse, the, memory, cell, is, the, fundamental, building, block, of, computer, memory, the, memory, cell, is, an, electronic, circuit, that, stores, one, bit, of, binary, information, and, it, must, be, set, to, store, a, logic, 1, high, voltage, level, and, reset, to, store, a, logic, 0, low, voltage, level, its, value, is, maintained, stored, until, it, is, changed, by, the, set, reset, process, the, value, in, the, memory, cell, can, be, accessed, by, reading, it, in, sram, the, memory, cell, is, a, type, of, flip, flop, circuit, usually, implemented, using, fets, this, means, that, sram, requires, very, low, power, when, not, being, accessed, but, it, is, expensive, and, has, low, storage, density, a, second, type, dram, is, based, around, a, capacitor, charging, and, discharging, this, capacitor, can, store, a, 1, or, a, 0, in, the, cell, however, the, charge, in, this, capacitor, slowly, leaks, away, and, must, be, refreshed, periodically, because, of, this, refresh, process, dram, uses, more, power, but, it, can, achieve, greater, storage, densities, and, lower, unit, costs, compared, to, sram, to, be, useful, memory, cells, must, be, readable, and, writable, within, the, ram, device, multiplexing, and, demultiplexing, circuitry, is, used, to, select, memory, cells, typically, a, ram, device, has, a, set, of, address, lines, a, 0, a, 1, a, n, displaystyle, a, 0, a, 1, a, n, and, for, each, combination, of, bits, that, may, be, applied, to, these, lines, a, set, of, memory, cells, are, activated, due, to, this, addressing, ram, devices, virtually, always, have, a, memory, capacity, that, is, a, power, of, two, usually, several, memory, cells, share, the, same, address, for, example, a, 4, bit, wide, ram, chip, has, 4, memory, cells, for, each, address, often, the, width, of, the, memory, and, that, of, the, microprocessor, are, different, for, a, 32, bit, microprocessor, eight, 4, bit, ram, chips, would, be, needed, often, more, addresses, are, needed, than, can, be, provided, by, a, device, in, that, case, external, multiplexors, to, the, device, are, used, to, activate, the, correct, device, that, is, being, accessed, ram, is, often, byte, addressable, although, it, is, also, possible, to, make, ram, that, is, word, addressable, one, can, read, and, over, write, data, in, ram, many, computer, systems, have, a, memory, hierarchy, consisting, of, processor, registers, on, die, sram, caches, external, caches, dram, paging, systems, and, virtual, memory, or, swap, space, on, a, hard, drive, this, entire, pool, of, memory, may, be, referred, to, as, ram, by, many, developers, even, though, the, various, subsystems, can, have, very, different, access, times, violating, the, original, concept, behind, the, random, access, term, in, ram, even, within, a, hierarchy, level, such, as, dram, the, specific, row, column, bank, rank, channel, or, interleave, organization, of, the, components, make, the, access, time, variable, although, not, to, the, extent, that, access, time, to, rotating, storage, media, or, a, tape, is, variable, the, overall, goal, of, using, a, memory, hierarchy, is, to, obtain, the, fastest, possible, average, access, time, while, minimizing, the, total, cost, of, the, entire, memory, system, generally, the, memory, hierarchy, follows, the, access, time, with, the, fast, cpu, registers, at, the, top, and, the, slow, hard, drive, at, the, bottom, in, many, modern, personal, computers, the, ram, comes, in, an, easily, upgraded, form, of, modules, called, memory, modules, or, dram, modules, about, the, size, of, a, few, sticks, of, chewing, gum, these, can, be, quickly, replaced, should, they, become, damaged, or, when, changing, needs, demand, more, storage, capacity, as, suggested, above, smaller, amounts, of, ram, mostly, sram, are, also, integrated, in, the, cpu, and, other, ics, on, the, motherboard, as, well, as, in, hard, drives, cd, roms, and, several, other, parts, of, the, computer, system, in, addition, to, serving, as, temporary, storage, and, working, space, for, the, operating, system, and, applications, ram, is, used, in, numerous, other, ways, most, modern, operating, systems, employ, a, method, of, extending, ram, capacity, known, as, virtual, memory, a, portion, of, the, computer, s, hard, drive, is, set, aside, for, a, paging, file, or, a, scratch, partition, and, the, combination, of, physical, ram, and, the, paging, file, form, the, system, s, total, memory, for, example, if, a, computer, has, 2, gb, 1024, 3, b, of, ram, and, a, 1, gb, page, file, the, operating, system, has, 3, gb, total, memory, available, to, it, when, the, system, runs, low, on, physical, memory, it, can, swap, portions, of, ram, to, the, paging, file, to, make, room, for, new, data, as, well, as, to, read, previously, swapped, information, back, into, ram, excessive, use, of, this, mechanism, results, in, thrashing, and, generally, hampers, overall, system, performance, mainly, because, hard, drives, are, far, slower, than, ram, software, can, partition, a, portion, of, a, computer, s, ram, allowing, it, to, act, as, a, much, faster, hard, drive, that, is, called, a, ram, disk, a, ram, disk, loses, the, stored, data, when, the, computer, is, shut, down, unless, memory, is, arranged, to, have, a, standby, battery, source, or, changes, to, the, ram, disk, are, written, out, to, a, nonvolatile, disk, the, ram, disk, is, reloaded, from, the, physical, disk, upon, ram, disk, initialization, sometimes, the, contents, of, a, relatively, slow, rom, chip, are, copied, to, read, write, memory, to, allow, for, shorter, access, times, the, rom, chip, is, then, disabled, while, the, initialized, memory, locations, are, switched, in, on, the, same, block, of, addresses, often, write, protected, this, process, sometimes, called, shadowing, is, fairly, common, in, both, computers, and, embedded, systems, as, a, common, example, the, bios, in, typical, personal, computers, often, has, an, option, called, use, shadow, bios, or, similar, when, enabled, functions, that, rely, on, data, from, the, bios, s, rom, instead, use, dram, locations, most, can, also, toggle, shadowing, of, video, card, rom, or, other, rom, sections, depending, on, the, system, this, may, not, result, in, increased, performance, and, may, cause, incompatibilities, for, example, some, hardware, may, be, inaccessible, to, the, operating, system, if, shadow, ram, is, used, on, some, systems, the, benefit, may, be, hypothetical, because, the, bios, is, not, used, after, booting, in, favor, of, direct, hardware, access, free, memory, is, reduced, by, the, size, of, the, shadowed, roms, the, memory, wall, is, the, growing, disparity, of, speed, between, cpu, and, the, response, time, of, memory, known, as, memory, latency, outside, the, cpu, chip, an, important, reason, for, this, disparity, is, the, limited, communication, bandwidth, beyond, chip, boundaries, which, is, also, referred, to, as, bandwidth, wall, from, 1986, to, 2000, cpu, speed, improved, at, an, annual, rate, of, 55, while, off, chip, memory, response, time, only, improved, at, 10, given, these, trends, it, was, expected, that, memory, latency, would, become, an, overwhelming, bottleneck, in, computer, performance, another, reason, for, the, disparity, is, the, enormous, increase, in, the, size, of, memory, since, the, start, of, the, pc, revolution, in, the, 1980s, originally, pcs, contained, less, than, 1, mebibyte, of, ram, which, often, had, a, response, time, of, 1, cpu, clock, cycle, meaning, that, it, required, 0, wait, states, larger, memory, units, are, inherently, slower, than, smaller, ones, of, the, same, type, simply, because, it, takes, longer, for, signals, to, traverse, a, larger, circuit, constructing, a, memory, unit, of, many, gibibytes, with, a, response, time, of, one, clock, cycle, is, difficult, or, impossible, today, s, cpus, often, still, have, a, mebibyte, of, 0, wait, state, cache, memory, but, it, resides, on, the, same, chip, as, the, cpu, cores, due, to, the, bandwidth, limitations, of, chip, to, chip, communication, it, must, also, be, constructed, from, static, ram, which, is, far, more, expensive, than, the, dynamic, ram, used, for, larger, memories, static, ram, also, consumes, far, more, power, cpu, speed, improvements, slowed, significantly, partly, due, to, major, physical, barriers, and, partly, because, current, cpu, designs, have, already, hit, the, memory, wall, in, some, sense, intel, summarized, these, causes, in, a, 2005, document, first, of, all, as, chip, geometries, shrink, and, clock, frequencies, rise, the, transistor, leakage, current, increases, leading, to, excess, power, consumption, and, heat, secondly, the, advantages, of, higher, clock, speeds, are, in, part, negated, by, memory, latency, since, memory, access, times, have, not, been, able, to, keep, pace, with, increasing, clock, frequencies, third, for, certain, applications, traditional, serial, architectures, are, becoming, less, efficient, as, processors, get, faster, due, to, the, so, called, von, neumann, bottleneck, further, undercutting, any, gains, that, frequency, increases, might, otherwise, buy, in, addition, partly, due, to, limitations, in, the, means, of, producing, inductance, within, solid, state, devices, resistance, capacitance, rc, delays, in, signal, transmission, are, growing, as, feature, sizes, shrink, imposing, an, additional, bottleneck, that, frequency, increases, don, t, address, the, rc, delays, in, signal, transmission, were, also, noted, in, clock, rate, versus, ipc, the, end, of, the, road, for, conventional, microarchitectures, which, projected, a, maximum, of, 12, 5, average, annual, cpu, performance, improvement, between, 2000, and, 2014, a, different, concept, is, the, processor, memory, performance, gap, which, can, be, addressed, by, 3d, integrated, circuits, that, reduce, the, distance, between, the, logic, and, memory, aspects, that, are, further, apart, in, a, 2d, chip, memory, subsystem, design, requires, a, focus, on, the, gap, which, is, widening, over, time, the, main, method, of, bridging, the, gap, is, the, use, of, caches, small, amounts, of, high, speed, memory, that, houses, recent, operations, and, instructions, nearby, the, processor, speeding, up, the, execution, of, those, operations, or, instructions, in, cases, where, they, are, called, upon, frequently, multiple, levels, of, caching, have, been, developed, to, deal, with, the, widening, gap, and, the, performance, of, high, speed, modern, computers, relies, on, evolving, caching, techniques, there, can, be, up, to, a, 53, difference, between, the, growth, in, speed, of, processor, and, the, lagging, speed, of, main, memory, access, solid, state, hard, drives, have, continued, to, increase, in, speed, from, 400, mbit, s, via, sata3, in, 2012, up, to, 3, gb, s, via, nvme, pcie, in, 2018, closing, the, gap, between, ram, and, hard, disk, speeds, although, ram, continues, to, be, an, order, of, magnitude, faster, with, single, lane, ddr4, 3200, capable, of, 25, gb, s, and, modern, gddr, even, faster, fast, cheap, non, volatile, solid, state, drives, have, replaced, some, functions, formerly, performed, by, ram, such, as, holding, certain, data, for, immediate, availability, in, server, farms, 1, terabyte, of, ssd, storage, can, be, had, for, 200, while, 1, tb, of, ram, would, cost, thousands, of, dollars
