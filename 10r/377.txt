instrumentation, is, a, collective, term, for, measuring, instruments, used, for, indicating, measuring, and, recording, physical, quantities, it, is, also, a, field, of, study, about, the, art, and, science, about, making, measurement, instruments, involving, the, related, areas, of, metrology, automation, and, control, theory, the, term, has, its, origins, in, the, art, and, science, of, scientific, instrument, making, instrumentation, can, refer, to, devices, as, simple, as, direct, reading, thermometers, or, as, complex, as, multi, sensor, components, of, industrial, control, systems, instruments, can, be, found, in, laboratories, refineries, factories, and, vehicles, as, well, as, in, everyday, household, use, e, g, smoke, detectors, and, thermostats, instrumentation, is, used, to, measure, many, parameters, physical, values, including, the, history, of, instrumentation, can, be, divided, into, several, phases, elements, of, industrial, instrumentation, have, long, histories, scales, for, comparing, weights, and, simple, pointers, to, indicate, position, are, ancient, technologies, some, of, the, earliest, measurements, were, of, time, one, of, the, oldest, water, clocks, was, found, in, the, tomb, of, the, ancient, egyptian, pharaoh, amenhotep, i, buried, around, 1500, bce, improvements, were, incorporated, in, the, clocks, by, 270, bce, they, had, the, rudiments, of, an, automatic, control, system, device, in, 1663, christopher, wren, presented, the, royal, society, with, a, design, for, a, weather, clock, a, drawing, shows, meteorological, sensors, moving, pens, over, paper, driven, by, clockwork, such, devices, did, not, become, standard, in, meteorology, for, two, centuries, the, concept, has, remained, virtually, unchanged, as, evidenced, by, pneumatic, chart, recorders, where, a, pressurized, bellows, displaces, a, pen, integrating, sensors, displays, recorders, and, controls, was, uncommon, until, the, industrial, revolution, limited, by, both, need, and, practicality, early, systems, used, direct, process, connections, to, local, control, panels, for, control, and, indication, which, from, the, early, 1930s, saw, the, introduction, of, pneumatic, transmitters, and, automatic, 3, term, pid, controllers, the, ranges, of, pneumatic, transmitters, were, defined, by, the, need, to, control, valves, and, actuators, in, the, field, typically, a, signal, ranged, from, 3, to, 15, psi, 20, to, 100kpa, or, 0, 2, to, 1, 0, kg, cm2, as, a, standard, was, standardized, with, 6, to, 30, psi, occasionally, being, used, for, larger, valves, transistor, electronics, enabled, wiring, to, replace, pipes, initially, with, a, range, of, 20, to, 100ma, at, up, to, 90v, for, loop, powered, devices, reducing, to, 4, to, 20ma, at, 12, to, 24v, in, more, modern, systems, a, transmitter, is, a, device, that, produces, an, output, signal, often, in, the, form, of, a, 4, 20, ma, electrical, current, signal, although, many, other, options, using, voltage, frequency, pressure, or, ethernet, are, possible, the, transistor, was, commercialized, by, the, mid, 1950s, instruments, attached, to, a, control, system, provided, signals, used, to, operate, solenoids, valves, regulators, circuit, breakers, relays, and, other, devices, such, devices, could, control, a, desired, output, variable, and, provide, either, remote, monitoring, or, automated, control, capabilities, each, instrument, company, introduced, their, own, standard, instrumentation, signal, causing, confusion, until, the, 4, 20, ma, range, was, used, as, the, standard, electronic, instrument, signal, for, transmitters, and, valves, this, signal, was, eventually, standardized, as, ansi, isa, s50, compatibility, of, analog, signals, for, electronic, industrial, process, instruments, in, the, 1970s, the, transformation, of, instrumentation, from, mechanical, pneumatic, transmitters, controllers, and, valves, to, electronic, instruments, reduced, maintenance, costs, as, electronic, instruments, were, more, dependable, than, mechanical, instruments, this, also, increased, efficiency, and, production, due, to, their, increase, in, accuracy, pneumatics, enjoyed, some, advantages, being, favored, in, corrosive, and, explosive, atmospheres, in, the, early, years, of, process, control, process, indicators, and, control, elements, such, as, valves, were, monitored, by, an, operator, that, walked, around, the, unit, adjusting, the, valves, to, obtain, the, desired, temperatures, pressures, and, flows, as, technology, evolved, pneumatic, controllers, were, invented, and, mounted, in, the, field, that, monitored, the, process, and, controlled, the, valves, this, reduced, the, amount, of, time, process, operators, needed, to, monitor, the, process, latter, years, the, actual, controllers, were, moved, to, a, central, room, and, signals, were, sent, into, the, control, room, to, monitor, the, process, and, outputs, signals, were, sent, to, the, final, control, element, such, as, a, valve, to, adjust, the, process, as, needed, these, controllers, and, indicators, were, mounted, on, a, wall, called, a, control, board, the, operators, stood, in, front, of, this, board, walking, back, and, forth, monitoring, the, process, indicators, this, again, reduced, the, number, and, amount, of, time, process, operators, were, needed, to, walk, around, the, units, the, most, standard, pneumatic, signal, level, used, during, these, years, was, 3, 15, psig, process, control, of, large, industrial, plants, has, evolved, through, many, stages, initially, control, would, be, from, panels, local, to, the, process, plant, however, this, required, a, large, manpower, resource, to, attend, to, these, dispersed, panels, and, there, was, no, overall, view, of, the, process, the, next, logical, development, was, the, transmission, of, all, plant, measurements, to, a, permanently, staffed, central, control, room, effectively, this, was, the, centralization, of, all, the, localized, panels, with, the, advantages, of, lower, manning, levels, and, easy, overview, of, the, process, often, the, controllers, were, behind, the, control, room, panels, and, all, automatic, and, manual, control, outputs, were, transmitted, back, to, plant, however, whilst, providing, a, central, control, focus, this, arrangement, was, inflexible, as, each, control, loop, had, its, own, controller, hardware, and, continual, operator, movement, within, the, control, room, was, required, to, view, different, parts, of, the, process, with, coming, of, electronic, processors, and, graphic, displays, it, became, possible, to, replace, these, discrete, controllers, with, computer, based, algorithms, hosted, on, a, network, of, input, output, racks, with, their, own, control, processors, these, could, be, distributed, around, plant, and, communicate, with, the, graphic, display, in, the, control, room, or, rooms, the, distributed, control, concept, was, born, the, introduction, of, dcss, and, scada, allowed, easy, interconnection, and, re, configuration, of, plant, controls, such, as, cascaded, loops, and, interlocks, and, easy, interfacing, with, other, production, computer, systems, it, enabled, sophisticated, alarm, handling, introduced, automatic, event, logging, removed, the, need, for, physical, records, such, as, chart, recorders, allowed, the, control, racks, to, be, networked, and, thereby, located, locally, to, plant, to, reduce, cabling, runs, and, provided, high, level, overviews, of, plant, status, and, production, levels, in, some, cases, the, sensor, is, a, very, minor, element, of, the, mechanism, digital, cameras, and, wristwatches, might, technically, meet, the, loose, definition, of, instrumentation, because, they, record, and, or, display, sensed, information, under, most, circumstances, neither, would, be, called, instrumentation, but, when, used, to, measure, the, elapsed, time, of, a, race, and, to, document, the, winner, at, the, finish, line, both, would, be, called, instrumentation, a, very, simple, example, of, an, instrumentation, system, is, a, mechanical, thermostat, used, to, control, a, household, furnace, and, thus, to, control, room, temperature, a, typical, unit, senses, temperature, with, a, bi, metallic, strip, it, displays, temperature, by, a, needle, on, the, free, end, of, the, strip, it, activates, the, furnace, by, a, mercury, switch, as, the, switch, is, rotated, by, the, strip, the, mercury, makes, physical, and, thus, electrical, contact, between, electrodes, another, example, of, an, instrumentation, system, is, a, home, security, system, such, a, system, consists, of, sensors, motion, detection, switches, to, detect, door, openings, simple, algorithms, to, detect, intrusion, local, control, arm, disarm, and, remote, monitoring, of, the, system, so, that, the, police, can, be, summoned, communication, is, an, inherent, part, of, the, design, kitchen, appliances, use, sensors, for, control, modern, automobiles, have, complex, instrumentation, in, addition, to, displays, of, engine, rotational, speed, and, vehicle, linear, speed, there, are, also, displays, of, battery, voltage, and, current, fluid, levels, fluid, temperatures, distance, traveled, and, feedback, of, various, controls, turn, signals, parking, brake, headlights, transmission, position, cautions, may, be, displayed, for, special, problems, fuel, low, check, engine, tire, pressure, low, door, ajar, seat, belt, unfastened, problems, are, recorded, so, they, can, be, reported, to, diagnostic, equipment, navigation, systems, can, provide, voice, commands, to, reach, a, destination, automotive, instrumentation, must, be, cheap, and, reliable, over, long, periods, in, harsh, environments, there, may, be, independent, airbag, systems, that, contain, sensors, logic, and, actuators, anti, skid, braking, systems, use, sensors, to, control, the, brakes, while, cruise, control, affects, throttle, position, a, wide, variety, of, services, can, be, provided, via, communication, links, on, the, onstar, system, autonomous, cars, with, exotic, instrumentation, have, been, shown, early, aircraft, had, a, few, sensors, steam, gauges, converted, air, pressures, into, needle, deflections, that, could, be, interpreted, as, altitude, and, airspeed, a, magnetic, compass, provided, a, sense, of, direction, the, displays, to, the, pilot, were, as, critical, as, the, measurements, a, modern, aircraft, has, a, far, more, sophisticated, suite, of, sensors, and, displays, which, are, embedded, into, avionics, systems, the, aircraft, may, contain, inertial, navigation, systems, global, positioning, systems, weather, radar, autopilots, and, aircraft, stabilization, systems, redundant, sensors, are, used, for, reliability, a, subset, of, the, information, may, be, transferred, to, a, crash, recorder, to, aid, mishap, investigations, modern, pilot, displays, now, include, computer, displays, including, head, up, displays, air, traffic, control, radar, is, a, distributed, instrumentation, system, the, ground, part, sends, an, electromagnetic, pulse, and, receives, an, echo, at, least, aircraft, carry, transponders, that, transmit, codes, on, reception, of, the, pulse, the, system, displays, an, aircraft, map, location, an, identifier, and, optionally, altitude, the, map, location, is, based, on, sensed, antenna, direction, and, sensed, time, delay, the, other, information, is, embedded, in, the, transponder, transmission, among, the, possible, uses, of, the, term, is, a, collection, of, laboratory, test, equipment, controlled, by, a, computer, through, an, ieee, 488, bus, also, known, as, gpib, for, general, purpose, instrument, bus, or, hpib, for, hewlitt, packard, instrument, bus, laboratory, equipment, is, available, to, measure, many, electrical, and, chemical, quantities, such, a, collection, of, equipment, might, be, used, to, automate, the, testing, of, drinking, water, for, pollutants, instrumentation, engineering, is, the, engineering, specialization, focused, on, the, principle, and, operation, of, measuring, instruments, that, are, used, in, design, and, configuration, of, automated, systems, in, areas, such, as, electrical, and, pneumatic, domains, and, the, control, of, quantities, being, measured, they, typically, work, for, industries, with, automated, processes, such, as, chemical, or, manufacturing, plants, with, the, goal, of, improving, system, productivity, reliability, safety, optimization, and, stability, to, control, the, parameters, in, a, process, or, in, a, particular, system, devices, such, as, microprocessors, microcontrollers, or, plcs, are, used, but, their, ultimate, aim, is, to, control, the, parameters, of, a, system, instrumentation, engineering, is, loosely, defined, because, the, required, tasks, are, very, domain, dependent, an, expert, in, the, biomedical, instrumentation, of, laboratory, rats, has, very, different, concerns, than, the, expert, in, rocket, instrumentation, common, concerns, of, both, are, the, selection, of, appropriate, sensors, based, on, size, weight, cost, reliability, accuracy, longevity, environmental, robustness, and, frequency, response, some, sensors, are, literally, fired, in, artillery, shells, others, sense, thermonuclear, explosions, until, destroyed, invariably, sensor, data, must, be, recorded, transmitted, or, displayed, recording, rates, and, capacities, vary, enormously, transmission, can, be, trivial, or, can, be, clandestine, encrypted, and, low, power, in, the, presence, of, jamming, displays, can, be, trivially, simple, or, can, require, consultation, with, human, factors, experts, control, system, design, varies, from, trivial, to, a, separate, specialty, instrumentation, engineers, are, responsible, for, integrating, the, sensors, with, the, recorders, transmitters, displays, or, control, systems, and, producing, the, piping, and, instrumentation, diagram, for, the, process, they, may, design, or, specify, installation, wiring, and, signal, conditioning, they, may, be, responsible, for, commissioning, calibration, testing, and, maintenance, of, the, system, in, a, research, environment, it, is, common, for, subject, matter, experts, to, have, substantial, instrumentation, system, expertise, an, astronomer, knows, the, structure, of, the, universe, and, a, great, deal, about, telescopes, optics, pointing, and, cameras, or, other, sensing, elements, that, often, includes, the, hard, won, knowledge, of, the, operational, procedures, that, provide, the, best, results, for, example, an, astronomer, is, often, knowledgeable, of, techniques, to, minimize, temperature, gradients, that, cause, air, turbulence, within, the, telescope, instrumentation, technologists, technicians, and, mechanics, specialize, in, troubleshooting, repairing, and, maintaining, instruments, and, instrumentation, systems, ralph, m, ller, 1940, stated, that, the, history, of, physical, science, is, largely, the, history, of, instruments, and, their, intelligent, use, is, well, known, the, broad, generalizations, and, theories, which, have, arisen, from, time, to, time, have, stood, or, fallen, on, the, basis, of, accurate, measurement, and, in, several, instances, new, instruments, have, had, to, be, devised, for, the, purpose, there, is, little, evidence, to, show, that, the, mind, of, modern, man, is, superior, to, that, of, the, ancients, his, tools, are, incomparably, better, 290, davis, baird, has, argued, that, the, major, change, associated, with, floris, cohen, s, identification, of, a, fourth, big, scientific, revolution, after, world, war, ii, is, the, development, of, scientific, instrumentation, not, only, in, chemistry, but, across, the, sciences, in, chemistry, the, introduction, of, new, instrumentation, in, the, 1940s, was, nothing, less, than, a, scientific, and, technological, revolution, 28, 29, in, which, classical, wet, and, dry, methods, of, structural, organic, chemistry, were, discarded, and, new, areas, of, research, opened, up, 38, as, early, as, 1954, w, a, wildhack, discussed, both, the, productive, and, destructive, potential, inherent, in, process, control, the, ability, to, make, precise, verifiable, and, reproducible, measurements, of, the, natural, world, at, levels, that, were, not, previously, observable, using, scientific, instrumentation, has, provided, a, different, texture, of, the, world, this, instrumentation, revolution, fundamentally, changes, human, abilities, to, monitor, and, respond, as, is, illustrated, in, the, examples, of, ddt, monitoring, and, the, use, of, uv, spectrophotometry, and, gas, chromatography, to, monitor, water, pollutants
