varieties, being, wrapped, in, paper, some, pastel, brands, use, pumice, in, the, binder, to, abrade, the, paper, and, create, more, tooth, dry, pastel, media, can, be, subdivided, as, follows, in, addition, pastels, using, a, different, approach, to, manufacture, have, been, developed, there, has, been, some, debate, within, art, societies, as, to, what, exactly, qualifies, as, a, pastel, the,

sanguine, or, any, dry, media, the, emphasis, appears, to, be, on, dry, media, but, the, debate, continues, in, order, to, create, hard, and, soft, pastels, pigments, are, ground, into, a, paste, with, water, and, a, gum, binder, and, then, rolled, pressed, or, extruded, into, sticks, the, name, pastel, is, derived, from, medieval, latin, pastellum, woad, paste, from, late, latin, pastellus, paste, the, french, word, pastel, first, appeared, in, 1662, most, brands, produce, gradations, of, a, color, the, original, pigment, of, which, tends, to, be, dark, from, pure, pigment, to, near, white, by, mixing, in, differing, quantities, of, chalk, this, mixing, of, pigments, with, chalks, is, the, origin, of, the, word, pastel, in, reference, to, pale, color, as, it, is, commonly, used, in, cosmetic, and, fashion, contexts, a, pastel, is, made, by, letting, the, sticks, move, over, an, abrasive, ground, leaving, color, on, the, grain, of, the, painting, surface, when, fully, covered, with, pastel, the, work, is, called, a, pastel, painting, when, not, a, pastel, sketch, or, drawing, pastel, paintings, being, made, with, a, medium, that, has, the, highest, pigment, concentration, of, all, reflect, light, without, darkening, refraction, allowing, for, very, saturated, colors, pastel, supports, need, to, provide, a, tooth, for, the, pastel, to, adhere, and, hold, the, pigment, in, place, supports, include, pastels, can, be, used, to, produce, a, permanent, painting, if, the, artist, meets, appropriate, archival, considerations, this, means, for, these, reasons, some, pastelists, avoid, the, use, of, a, fixative, except, in, cases, where, the, pastel, has, been, overworked, so, much, that, the, surface, will, no, longer, hold, any, more, pastel, the, fixative, will, restore, the, tooth, and, more, pastel, can, be, applied, on, top, it, is, the, tooth, of, the, painting, surface, that, holds, the, pastels, not, a, fixative, abrasive, supports, avoid, or, minimize, the, need, to, apply, further, fixative, in, this, way, spectrafix, a, modern, casein, fixative, available, premixed, in, a, pump, misting, bottle, or, as, concentrate, to, be, mixed, with, alcohol, is, not, toxic, and, does, not, darken, or, dull, pastel, colors, however, spectrafix, takes, some, practice, to, use, because, it, s, applied, with, a, pump, misting, bottle, instead, of, an, aerosol, spray, can, it, is, easy, to, use, too, much, spectrafix, and, leave, puddles, of, liquid, that, may, dissolve, passages, of, color, also, it, takes, a, little, longer, to, dry, than, conventional, spray, fixatives, between, light, layers, glassine, paper, is, used, by, artists, to, protect, artwork, which, is, being, stored, or, transported, some, good, quality, books, of, pastel, papers, also, include, glassine, to, separate, pages, pastel, techniques, can, be, challenging, since, the, medium, is, mixed, and, blended, directly, on, the, working, surface, and, unlike, paint, colors, cannot, be, tested, on, a, palette, before, applying, to, the, surface, pastel, errors, cannot, be, covered, the, way, a, paint, error, can, be, painted, out, experimentation, with, the, pastel, medium, on, a, small, scale, in, order, to, learn, various, techniques, gives, the, user, a, better, command, over, a, larger, composition, pastels, have, some, techniques, in, common, with, painting, such, as, blending, masking, building, up, layers, of, color, adding, accents, and, highlighting, and, shading, some, techniques, are, characteristic, of, both, pastels, and, sketching, mediums, such, as, charcoal, and, lead, for, example, hatching, and, crosshatching, and, gradation, other, techniques, are, particular, to, the, pastel, medium, pastels, are, a, dry, medium, and, produce, a, great, deal, of, dust, which, can, cause, respiratory, irritation, more, seriously, pastels, might, use, the, same, pigments, as, artists, paints, many, of, which, are, toxic, for, example, exposure, to, cadmium, pigments, which, are, common, and, popular, bright, yellows, oranges, and, reds, can, lead, to, cadmium, poisoning, pastel, artists, who, use, the, pigments, without, a, strong, painting, binder, are, especially, susceptible, to, such, poisoning, for, this, reason, many, modern, pastels, are, made, using, substitutions, for, cadmium, chromium, and, other, toxic, pigments, while, retaining, the, traditional, pigment, names, also, to, note, that, all, brands, that, have, the, ap, label, by, astm, international, are, not, considered, toxic, and, they, might, use, extremely, insoluble, varieties, of, cadmium, or, cobalt, pigments, that, will, not, be, readily, absorbed, by, the, human, body, although, less, toxic, when, swallowed, they, should, still, be, treated, with, care, the, manufacture, of, pastels, originated, in, the, 15th, century, the, pastel, medium, was, mentioned, by, leonardo, da, vinci, who, learned, of, it, from, the, french, artist,

relating, to, venice, and, this, probably, contributed, to, a, growing, enthusiasm, for, the, medium, in, the, united, states, in, particular, he, demonstrated, how, few, strokes, were, required, to, evoke, a, place, or, an, atmosphere, mary, cassatt, an, american, artist, active, in, france, introduced, the, impressionists, and, pastel, to, her, friends, in, philadelphia, and, washington,
