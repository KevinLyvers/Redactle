metalworking, is, the, process, of, shaping, and, reshaping, metals, in, order, to, create, useful, objects, parts, assemblies, and, large, scale, structures, as, a, term, it, covers, a, wide, and, diverse, range, of, processes, skills, and, tools, for, producing, objects, on, every, scale, from, huge, ships, buildings, and, bridges, down, to, precise, engine, parts, and, delicate, jewelry, the, historical, roots, of, metalworking, predate, recorded, history, its, use, spans, cultures, civilizations, and, millennia, it, has, evolved, from, shaping, soft, native, metals, like, gold, with, simple, hand, tools, through, the, smelting, of, ores, and, hot, forging, of, harder, metals, like, iron, up, to, and, including, highly, technical, modern, processes, such, as, machining, and, welding, it, has, been, used, as, an, industry, a, driver, of, trade, individual, hobbies, and, in, the, creation, of, art, it, can, be, regarded, as, both, a, science, and, a, craft, modern, metalworking, processes, though, diverse, and, specialized, can, be, categorized, into, one, of, three, broad, areas, known, as, forming, cutting, or, joining, processes, modern, metalworking, workshops, typically, known, as, machine, shops, hold, a, wide, variety, of, specialized, or, general, use, machine, tools, capable, of, creating, highly, precise, useful, products, many, simpler, metalworking, techniques, such, as, blacksmithing, are, no, longer, economically, competitive, on, a, large, scale, in, developed, countries, some, of, them, are, still, in, use, in, less, developed, countries, for, artisanal, or, hobby, work, or, for, historical, reenactment, the, oldest, archaeological, evidence, of, copper, mining, and, working, was, the, discovery, of, a, copper, pendant, in, northern, iraq, from, 8, 700, bce, the, earliest, substantiated, and, dated, evidence, of, metalworking, in, the, americas, was, the, processing, of, copper, in, wisconsin, near, lake, michigan, copper, was, hammered, until, it, became, brittle, then, heated, so, it, could, be, worked, further, in, america, this, technology, is, dated, to, about, 4000, 5000, bce, the, oldest, gold, artifacts, in, the, world, come, from, the, bulgarian, varna, necropolis, and, date, from, 4450, bce, not, all, metal, required, fire, to, obtain, it, or, work, it, isaac, asimov, speculated, that, gold, was, the, first, metal, his, reasoning, being, that, by, its, chemistry, it, is, found, in, nature, as, nuggets, of, pure, gold, in, other, words, gold, as, rare, as, it, is, is, sometimes, found, in, nature, as, a, native, metal, some, metals, can, also, be, found, in, meteors, almost, all, other, metals, are, found, in, ores, a, mineral, bearing, rock, that, require, heat, or, some, other, process, to, liberate, the, metal, another, feature, of, gold, is, that, it, is, workable, as, it, is, found, meaning, that, no, technology, beyond, a, stone, hammer, and, anvil, is, needed, to, work, the, metal, this, is, a, result, of, gold, s, properties, of, malleability, and, ductility, the, earliest, tools, were, stone, bone, wood, and, sinew, all, of, which, sufficed, to, work, gold, at, some, unknown, time, the, process, of, liberating, metals, from, rock, by, heat, became, known, and, rocks, rich, in, copper, tin, and, lead, came, into, demand, these, ores, were, mined, wherever, they, were, recognized, remnants, of, such, ancient, mines, have, been, found, all, over, southwestern, asia, metalworking, was, being, carried, out, by, the, south, asian, inhabitants, of, mehrgarh, between, 7000, and, 3300, bce, the, end, of, the, beginning, of, metalworking, occurs, sometime, around, 6000, bce, when, copper, smelting, became, common, in, southwestern, asia, ancient, civilisations, knew, of, seven, metals, here, they, are, arranged, in, order, of, their, oxidation, potential, in, volts, the, oxidation, potential, is, important, because, it, is, one, indicator, of, how, tightly, bound, to, the, ore, the, metal, is, likely, to, be, as, can, be, seen, iron, is, significantly, higher, than, the, other, six, metals, while, gold, is, dramatically, lower, than, the, six, above, it, gold, s, low, oxidation, is, one, of, the, main, reasons, that, gold, is, found, in, nuggets, these, nuggets, are, relatively, pure, gold, and, are, workable, as, they, are, found, copper, ore, being, relatively, abundant, and, tin, ore, became, the, next, important, substances, in, the, story, of, metalworking, using, heat, to, smelt, copper, from, ore, a, great, deal, of, copper, was, produced, it, was, used, for, both, jewelry, and, simple, tools, however, copper, by, itself, was, too, soft, for, tools, requiring, edges, and, stiffness, at, some, point, tin, was, added, into, the, molten, copper, and, bronze, was, developed, thereby, bronze, is, an, alloy, of, copper, and, tin, bronze, was, an, important, advance, because, it, had, the, edge, durability, and, stiffness, that, pure, copper, lacked, until, the, advent, of, iron, bronze, was, the, most, advanced, metal, for, tools, and, weapons, in, common, use, see, bronze, age, for, more, detail, outside, southwestern, asia, these, same, advances, and, materials, were, being, discovered, and, used, around, the, world, people, in, china, and, great, britain, began, using, bronze, with, little, time, being, devoted, to, copper, japanese, began, the, use, of, bronze, and, iron, almost, simultaneously, in, the, americas, it, was, different, although, the, peoples, of, the, americas, knew, of, metals, it, was, not, until, the, european, colonisation, that, metalworking, for, tools, and, weapons, became, common, jewelry, and, art, were, the, principal, uses, of, metals, in, the, americas, prior, to, european, influence, about, 2700, bce, production, of, bronze, was, common, in, locales, where, the, necessary, materials, could, be, assembled, for, smelting, heating, and, working, the, metal, iron, was, beginning, to, be, smelted, and, began, its, emergence, as, an, important, metal, for, tools, and, weapons, the, period, that, followed, became, known, as, the, iron, age, by, the, historical, periods, of, the, pharaohs, in, egypt, the, vedic, kings, in, india, the, tribes, of, israel, and, the, maya, civilization, in, north, america, among, other, ancient, populations, precious, metals, began, to, have, value, attached, to, them, in, some, cases, rules, for, ownership, distribution, and, trade, were, created, enforced, and, agreed, upon, by, the, respective, peoples, by, the, above, periods, metalworkers, were, very, skilled, at, creating, objects, of, adornment, religious, artifacts, and, trade, instruments, of, precious, metals, non, ferrous, as, well, as, weaponry, usually, of, ferrous, metals, and, or, alloys, these, skills, were, well, executed, the, techniques, were, practiced, by, artisans, blacksmiths, atharvavedic, practitioners, alchemists, and, other, categories, of, metalworkers, around, the, globe, for, example, the, granulation, technique, was, employed, by, numerous, ancient, cultures, before, the, historic, record, shows, people, traveled, to, far, regions, to, share, this, process, metalsmiths, today, still, use, this, and, many, other, ancient, techniques, as, time, progressed, metal, objects, became, more, common, and, ever, more, complex, the, need, to, further, acquire, and, work, metals, grew, in, importance, skills, related, to, extracting, metal, ores, from, the, earth, began, to, evolve, and, metalsmiths, became, more, knowledgeable, metalsmiths, became, important, members, of, society, fates, and, economies, of, entire, civilizations, were, greatly, affected, by, the, availability, of, metals, and, metalsmiths, the, metalworker, depends, on, the, extraction, of, precious, metals, to, make, jewelry, build, more, efficient, electronics, and, for, industrial, and, technological, applications, from, construction, to, shipping, containers, to, rail, and, air, transport, without, metals, goods, and, services, would, cease, to, move, around, the, globe, on, the, scale, we, know, today, metalworking, generally, is, divided, into, three, categories, forming, cutting, and, joining, most, metal, cutting, is, done, by, high, speed, steel, tools, or, carbide, tools, each, of, these, categories, contains, various, processes, prior, to, most, operations, the, metal, must, be, marked, out, and, or, measured, depending, on, the, desired, finished, product, marking, out, also, known, as, layout, is, the, process, of, transferring, a, design, or, pattern, to, a, workpiece, and, is, the, first, step, in, the, handcraft, of, metalworking, it, is, performed, in, many, industries, or, hobbies, although, in, industry, the, repetition, eliminates, the, need, to, mark, out, every, individual, piece, in, the, metal, trades, area, marking, out, consists, of, transferring, the, engineer, s, plan, to, the, workpiece, in, preparation, for, the, next, step, machining, or, manufacture, calipers, are, hand, tools, designed, to, precisely, measure, the, distance, between, two, points, most, calipers, have, two, sets, of, flat, parallel, edges, used, for, inner, or, outer, diameter, measurements, these, calipers, can, be, accurate, to, within, one, thousandth, of, an, inch, 25, 4, m, different, types, of, calipers, have, different, mechanisms, for, displaying, the, distance, measured, where, larger, objects, need, to, be, measured, with, less, precision, a, tape, measure, is, often, used, casting, achieves, a, specific, form, by, pouring, molten, metal, into, a, mold, and, allowing, it, to, cool, with, no, mechanical, force, forms, of, casting, include, these, forming, processes, modify, metal, or, workpiece, by, deforming, the, object, that, is, without, removing, any, material, forming, is, done, with, a, system, of, mechanical, forces, and, especially, for, bulk, metal, forming, with, heat, plastic, deformation, involves, using, heat, or, pressure, to, make, a, workpiece, more, conductive, to, mechanical, force, historically, this, and, casting, were, done, by, blacksmiths, though, today, the, process, has, been, industrialized, in, bulk, metal, forming, the, workpiece, is, generally, heated, up, these, types, of, forming, process, involve, the, application, of, mechanical, force, at, room, temperature, however, some, recent, developments, involve, the, heating, of, dies, and, or, parts, advancements, in, automated, metalworking, technology, have, made, progressive, die, stamping, possible, which, is, a, method, that, can, encompass, punching, coining, bending, and, several, other, ways, below, that, modify, metal, at, less, cost, while, resulting, in, less, scrap, cutting, is, a, collection, of, processes, wherein, material, is, brought, to, a, specified, geometry, by, removing, excess, material, using, various, kinds, of, tooling, to, leave, a, finished, part, that, meets, specifications, the, net, result, of, cutting, is, two, products, the, waste, or, excess, material, and, the, finished, part, in, woodworking, the, waste, would, be, sawdust, and, excess, wood, in, cutting, metals, the, waste, is, chips, or, swarf, and, excess, metal, cutting, processes, fall, into, one, of, three, major, categories, drilling, a, hole, in, a, metal, part, is, the, most, common, example, of, a, chip, producing, process, using, an, oxy, fuel, cutting, torch, to, separate, a, plate, of, steel, into, smaller, pieces, is, an, example, of, burning, chemical, milling, is, an, example, of, a, specialty, process, that, removes, excess, material, by, the, use, of, etching, chemicals, and, masking, chemicals, there, are, many, technologies, available, to, cut, metal, including, cutting, fluid, or, coolant, is, used, where, there, is, significant, friction, and, heat, at, the, cutting, interface, between, a, cutter, such, as, a, drill, or, an, end, mill, and, the, workpiece, coolant, is, generally, introduced, by, a, spray, across, the, face, of, the, tool, and, workpiece, to, decrease, friction, and, temperature, at, the, cutting, tool, workpiece, interface, to, prevent, excessive, tool, wear, in, practice, there, are, many, methods, of, delivering, coolant, the, use, of, an, angle, grinder, in, cutting, is, not, preferred, as, large, amounts, of, harmful, sparks, and, fumes, and, particulates, are, generated, when, compared, with, using, reciprocating, saw, or, band, saw, angle, grinders, produce, sparks, when, cutting, ferrous, metals, they, also, produce, shards, cutting, other, materials, milling, is, the, complex, shaping, of, metal, or, other, materials, by, removing, material, to, form, the, final, shape, it, is, generally, done, on, a, milling, machine, a, power, driven, machine, that, in, its, basic, form, consists, of, a, milling, cutter, that, rotates, about, the, spindle, axis, like, a, drill, and, a, worktable, that, can, move, in, multiple, directions, usually, two, dimensions, relative, to, the, workpiece, the, spindle, usually, moves, in, the, z, axis, it, is, possible, to, raise, the, table, where, the, workpiece, rests, milling, machines, may, be, operated, manually, or, under, computer, numerical, control, cnc, and, can, perform, a, vast, number, of, complex, operations, such, as, slot, cutting, planing, drilling, and, threading, rabbeting, routing, etc, two, common, types, of, mills, are, the, horizontal, mill, and, vertical, mill, the, pieces, produced, are, usually, complex, 3d, objects, that, are, converted, into, x, y, and, z, coordinates, that, are, then, fed, into, the, cnc, machine, and, allow, it, to, complete, the, tasks, required, the, milling, machine, can, produce, most, parts, in, 3d, but, some, require, the, objects, to, be, rotated, around, the, x, y, or, z, coordinate, axis, depending, on, the, need, tolerances, come, in, a, variety, of, standards, depending, on, the, locale, in, countries, still, using, the, imperial, system, this, is, usually, in, the, thousandths, of, an, inch, unit, known, as, thou, depending, on, the, specific, machine, in, many, other, european, countries, standards, following, the, iso, are, used, instead, in, order, to, keep, both, the, bit, and, material, cool, a, high, temperature, coolant, is, used, in, most, cases, the, coolant, is, sprayed, from, a, hose, directly, onto, the, bit, and, material, this, coolant, can, either, be, machine, or, user, controlled, depending, on, the, machine, materials, that, can, be, milled, range, from, aluminum, to, stainless, steel, and, almost, everything, in, between, each, material, requires, a, different, speed, on, the, milling, tool, and, varies, in, the, amount, of, material, that, can, be, removed, in, one, pass, of, the, tool, harder, materials, are, usually, milled, at, slower, speeds, with, small, amounts, of, material, removed, softer, materials, vary, but, usually, are, milled, with, a, high, bit, speed, the, use, of, a, milling, machine, adds, costs, that, are, factored, into, the, manufacturing, process, each, time, the, machine, is, used, coolant, is, also, used, which, must, be, periodically, added, in, order, to, prevent, breaking, bits, a, milling, bit, must, also, be, changed, as, needed, in, order, to, prevent, damage, to, the, material, time, is, the, biggest, factor, for, costs, complex, parts, can, require, hours, to, complete, while, very, simple, parts, take, only, minutes, this, in, turn, varies, the, production, time, as, well, as, each, part, will, require, different, amounts, of, time, safety, is, key, with, these, machines, the, bits, are, traveling, at, high, speeds, and, removing, pieces, of, usually, scalding, hot, metal, the, advantage, of, having, a, cnc, milling, machine, is, that, it, protects, the, machine, operator, turning, is, a, metal, cutting, process, for, producing, a, cylindrical, surface, with, a, single, point, tool, the, workpiece, is, rotated, on, a, spindle, and, the, cutting, tool, is, fed, into, it, radially, axially, or, both, producing, surfaces, perpendicular, to, the, workpiece, axis, is, called, facing, producing, surfaces, using, both, radial, and, axial, feeds, is, called, profiling, a, lathe, is, a, machine, tool, which, spins, a, block, or, cylinder, of, material, so, that, when, abrasive, cutting, or, deformation, tools, are, applied, to, the, workpiece, it, can, be, shaped, to, produce, an, object, which, has, rotational, symmetry, about, an, axis, of, rotation, examples, of, objects, that, can, be, produced, on, a, lathe, include, candlestick, holders, crankshafts, camshafts, and, bearing, mounts, lathes, have, four, main, components, the, bed, the, headstock, the, carriage, and, the, tailstock, the, bed, is, a, precise, very, strong, base, which, all, of, the, other, components, rest, upon, for, alignment, the, headstock, s, spindle, secures, the, workpiece, with, a, chuck, whose, jaws, usually, three, or, four, are, tightened, around, the, piece, the, spindle, rotates, at, high, speed, providing, the, energy, to, cut, the, material, while, historically, lathes, were, powered, by, belts, from, a, line, shaft, modern, examples, uses, electric, motors, the, workpiece, extends, out, of, the, spindle, along, the, axis, of, rotation, above, the, flat, bed, the, carriage, is, a, platform, that, can, be, moved, precisely, and, independently, parallel, and, perpendicular, to, the, axis, of, rotation, a, hardened, cutting, tool, is, held, at, the, desired, height, usually, the, middle, of, the, workpiece, by, the, toolpost, the, carriage, is, then, moved, around, the, rotating, workpiece, and, the, cutting, tool, gradually, removes, material, from, the, workpiece, the, tailstock, can, be, slid, along, the, axis, of, rotation, and, then, locked, in, place, as, necessary, it, may, hold, centers, to, further, secure, the, workpiece, or, cutting, tools, driven, into, the, end, of, the, workpiece, other, operations, that, can, be, performed, with, a, single, point, tool, on, a, lathe, are, chamfering, cutting, an, angle, on, the, corner, of, a, cylinder, parting, the, tool, is, fed, radially, into, the, workpiece, to, cut, off, the, end, of, a, part, threading, a, tool, is, fed, along, and, across, the, outside, or, inside, surface, of, rotating, parts, to, produce, external, or, internal, threads, boring, a, single, point, tool, is, fed, linearly, and, parallel, to, the, axis, of, rotation, to, create, a, round, hole, drilling, feeding, the, drill, into, the, workpiece, axially, knurling, uses, a, tool, to, produce, a, rough, surface, texture, on, the, work, piece, frequently, used, to, allow, grip, by, hand, on, a, metal, part, modern, computer, numerical, control, cnc, lathes, and, cnc, machining, centres, can, do, secondary, operations, like, milling, by, using, driven, tools, when, driven, tools, are, used, the, work, piece, stops, rotating, and, the, driven, tool, executes, the, machining, operation, with, a, rotating, cutting, tool, the, cnc, machines, use, x, y, and, z, coordinates, in, order, to, control, the, turning, tools, and, produce, the, product, most, modern, day, cnc, lathes, are, able, to, produce, most, turned, objects, in, 3d, nearly, all, types, of, metal, can, be, turned, although, more, time, specialist, cutting, tools, are, needed, for, harder, workpieces, there, are, many, threading, processes, including, cutting, threads, with, a, tap, or, die, thread, milling, single, point, thread, cutting, thread, rolling, cold, root, rolling, and, forming, and, thread, grinding, a, tap, is, used, to, cut, a, female, thread, on, the, inside, surface, of, a, pre, drilled, hole, while, a, die, cuts, a, male, thread, on, a, preformed, cylindrical, rod, grinding, uses, an, abrasive, process, to, remove, material, from, the, workpiece, a, grinding, machine, is, a, machine, tool, used, for, producing, very, fine, finishes, making, very, light, cuts, or, high, precision, forms, using, an, abrasive, wheel, as, the, cutting, device, this, wheel, can, be, made, up, of, various, sizes, and, types, of, stones, diamonds, or, inorganic, materials, the, simplest, grinder, is, a, bench, grinder, or, a, hand, held, angle, grinder, for, deburring, parts, or, cutting, metal, with, a, zip, disc, grinders, have, increased, in, size, and, complexity, with, advances, in, time, and, technology, from, the, old, days, of, a, manual, toolroom, grinder, sharpening, endmills, for, a, production, shop, to, today, s, 30000, rpm, cnc, auto, loading, manufacturing, cell, producing, jet, turbines, grinding, processes, vary, greatly, grinders, need, to, be, very, rigid, machines, to, produce, the, required, finish, some, grinders, are, even, used, to, produce, glass, scales, for, positioning, cnc, machine, axis, the, common, rule, is, the, machines, used, to, produce, scales, be, 10, times, more, accurate, than, the, machines, the, parts, are, produced, for, in, the, past, grinders, were, used, for, finishing, operations, only, because, of, limitations, of, tooling, modern, grinding, wheel, materials, and, the, use, of, industrial, diamonds, or, other, man, made, coatings, cubic, boron, nitride, on, wheel, forms, have, allowed, grinders, to, achieve, excellent, results, in, production, environments, instead, of, being, relegated, to, the, back, of, the, shop, modern, technology, has, advanced, grinding, operations, to, include, cnc, controls, high, material, removal, rates, with, high, precision, lending, itself, well, to, aerospace, applications, and, high, volume, production, runs, of, precision, components, filing, is, combination, of, grinding, and, saw, tooth, cutting, using, a, file, prior, to, the, development, of, modern, machining, equipment, it, provided, a, relatively, accurate, means, for, the, production, of, small, parts, especially, those, with, flat, surfaces, the, skilled, use, of, a, file, allowed, a, machinist, to, work, to, fine, tolerances, and, was, the, hallmark, of, the, craft, today, filing, is, rarely, used, as, a, production, technique, in, industry, though, it, remains, as, a, common, method, of, deburring, broaching, is, a, machining, operation, used, to, cut, keyways, into, shafts, electron, beam, machining, ebm, is, a, machining, process, where, high, velocity, electrons, are, directed, toward, a, work, piece, creating, heat, and, vaporizing, the, material, ultrasonic, machining, uses, ultrasonic, vibrations, to, machine, very, hard, or, brittle, materials, honing, is, a, process, where, a, honing, tool, consisting, of, abrasive, stones, or, pads, is, used, in, a, honing, machine, to, refine, the, surface, of, a, component, improving, its, geometry, and, finish, through, controlled, rotary, motion, welding, is, a, fabrication, process, that, joins, materials, usually, metals, or, thermoplastics, by, causing, coalescence, this, is, often, done, by, melting, the, workpieces, and, adding, a, filler, material, to, form, a, pool, of, molten, material, that, cools, to, become, a, strong, joint, but, sometimes, pressure, is, used, in, conjunction, with, heat, or, by, itself, to, produce, the, weld, many, different, energy, sources, can, be, used, for, welding, including, a, gas, flame, an, electric, arc, a, laser, an, electron, beam, friction, and, ultrasound, while, often, an, industrial, process, welding, can, be, done, in, many, different, environments, including, open, air, underwater, and, in, space, regardless, of, location, however, welding, remains, dangerous, and, precautions, must, be, taken, to, avoid, burns, electric, shock, poisonous, fumes, and, overexposure, to, ultraviolet, light, brazing, is, a, joining, process, in, which, a, filler, metal, is, melted, and, drawn, into, a, capillary, formed, by, the, assembly, of, two, or, more, work, pieces, the, filler, metal, reacts, metallurgically, with, the, workpieces, and, solidifies, in, the, capillary, forming, a, strong, joint, unlike, welding, the, work, piece, is, not, melted, brazing, is, similar, to, soldering, but, occurs, at, temperatures, in, excess, of, 450, c, 842, f, brazing, has, the, advantage, of, producing, less, thermal, stresses, than, welding, and, brazed, assemblies, tend, to, be, more, ductile, than, weldments, because, alloying, elements, can, not, segregate, and, precipitate, brazing, techniques, include, flame, brazing, resistance, brazing, furnace, brazing, diffusion, brazing, inductive, brazing, and, vacuum, brazing, soldering, is, a, joining, process, that, occurs, at, temperatures, below, 450, c, 842, f, it, is, similar, to, brazing, in, the, way, that, a, filler, is, melted, and, drawn, into, a, capillary, to, form, a, joint, although, at, a, lower, temperature, because, of, this, lower, temperature, and, different, alloys, used, as, fillers, the, metallurgical, reaction, between, filler, and, work, piece, is, minimal, resulting, in, a, weaker, joint, riveting, is, one, of, the, most, ancient, metalwork, joining, processes, its, use, declined, markedly, during, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, but, it, still, retains, important, uses, in, industry, and, construction, and, in, artisan, crafts, such, as, jewellery, medieval, armouring, and, metal, couture, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, earlier, use, of, rivets, is, being, superseded, by, improvements, in, welding, and, component, fabrication, techniques, a, rivet, is, essentially, a, two, headed, and, unthreaded, bolt, which, holds, two, other, pieces, of, metal, together, holes, are, drilled, or, punched, through, the, two, pieces, of, metal, to, be, joined, the, holes, being, aligned, a, rivet, is, passed, through, the, holes, and, permanent, heads, are, formed, onto, the, ends, of, the, rivet, utilizing, hammers, and, forming, dies, by, either, cold, working, or, hot, working, rivets, are, commonly, purchased, with, one, head, already, formed, when, it, is, necessary, to, remove, rivets, one, of, the, rivet, s, heads, is, sheared, off, with, a, cold, chisel, the, rivet, is, then, driven, out, with, a, hammer, and, punch, this, includes, screws, as, well, as, bolts, this, is, often, used, as, it, requires, relatively, little, specialist, equipment, and, are, therefore, often, used, in, flat, pack, furniture, it, can, also, be, used, when, a, metal, is, joined, to, another, material, such, as, wood, or, a, particular, metal, does, not, weld, well, such, as, aluminum, this, can, be, done, to, directly, join, metals, or, with, an, intermediate, material, such, as, nylon, while, often, weaker, than, other, methods, such, as, welding, or, brazing, the, metal, can, easily, be, removed, and, therefore, reused, or, recycled, it, can, also, be, done, in, conjunction, with, an, epoxy, or, glue, reverting, its, ecological, benefits, while, these, processes, are, not, primary, metalworking, processes, they, are, often, performed, before, or, after, metalworking, processes, metals, can, be, heat, treated, to, alter, the, properties, of, strength, ductility, toughness, hardness, or, resistance, to, corrosion, common, heat, treatment, processes, include, annealing, precipitation, hardening, quenching, and, tempering, often, mechanical, and, thermal, treatments, are, combined, in, what, is, known, as, thermo, mechanical, treatments, for, better, properties, and, more, efficient, processing, of, materials, these, processes, are, common, to, high, alloy, special, steels, super, alloys, and, titanium, alloys, electroplating, is, a, common, surface, treatment, technique, it, involves, bonding, a, thin, layer, of, another, metal, such, as, gold, silver, chromium, or, zinc, to, the, surface, of, the, product, by, hydrolysis, it, is, used, to, reduce, corrosion, create, abrasion, resistance, and, improve, the, product, s, aesthetic, appearance, plating, can, even, change, the, properties, of, the, original, part, including, conductivity, heat, dissipation, or, structural, integrity, there, are, four, main, electroplating, methods, to, ensure, proper, coating, and, cost, effectiveness, per, product, mass, plating, rack, plating, continuous, plating, and, line, plating, thermal, spraying, techniques, are, another, popular, finishing, option, and, often, have, better, high, temperature, properties, than, electroplated, coatings, due, to, the, thicker, coating, the, four, main, thermal, spray, processes, include, electric, wire, arc, spray, flame, oxy, acetylene, combustion, spray, plasma, spray, and, high, velocity, oxy, fuel, hvof, spray, general
