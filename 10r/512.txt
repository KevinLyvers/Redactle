literally, meaning, big, sword, as, japanese, does, not, have, separate, plural, and, singular, forms, both, katanas, and, katana, are, considered, acceptable, forms, in, english, pronounced, the,

each, other, if, signed, by, the, location, of, the, signature, mei, on, the, tang, nakago, in, general, the, mei, should, be, carved, into, the, side, of, the, nakago, which, would, face, outward, when, the, sword, was, worn, since, a, tachi, was, worn, with, the, cutting, edge, down, and, the, katana, was, worn, with, the, cutting, edge, up, the, mei, would, be, in, opposite, locations, on, the, tang, western, historians, have, said, that, katana, were, among, the, finest, cutting, weapons, in, world, military, history, however, the, main, weapons, on, the, battlefield, in, the, sengoku, period, in, the, 16th, century, were, yumi, bow, yari, spear, and, tanegashima, gun, and, katana, and, tachi, were, used, only, for, close, combat, during, this, period, the, tactics, changed, to, a, group, battle, by, ashigaru, foot, soldiers, mobilized, in, large, numbers, so, naginata, and, tachi, became, obsolete, as, weapons, on, the, battlefield, and, were, replaced, by, yari, and, katana, in, the, relatively, peaceful, edo, period, katana, increased, in, importance, as, a, weapon, and, at, the, end, of, the, edo, period, shishi, political, activists, fought, many, battles, using, katana, as, their, main, weapon, katana, and, tachi, were, often, used, as, gifts, between, daimyo, feudal, lord, and, samurai, or, as, offerings, to, the, kami, enshrined, in, shinto, shrines, and, symbols, of, authority, and, spirituality, of, samurai, the, production, of, swords, in, japan, is, divided, into, specific, time, periods, katana, originates, from, sasuga, a, kind, of, tant, short, sword, or, knife, used, by, lower, ranking, samurai, who, fought, on, foot, in, the, kamakura, period, 1185, 1333, their, main, weapon, was, a, long, naginata, and, sasuga, was, a, spare, weapon, in, the, nanboku, ch, period, 1336, 1392, which, corresponds, to, the, early, muromachi, period, 1336, 1573, long, weapons, such, as, dachi, were, popular, and, along, with, this, sasuga, lengthened, and, finally, became, katana, also, there, is, a, theory, that, koshigatana, a, kind, of, tant, which, was, equipped, by, high, ranking, samurai, together, with, tachi, developed, to, katana, through, the, same, historical, background, as, sasuga, and, it, is, possible, that, both, developed, to, katana, the, oldest, katana, in, existence, today, is, called, hishizukuri, uchigatana, which, was, forged, in, the, nanbokuch, period, and, was, dedicated, to, kasuga, shrine, later, the, first, use, of, katana, as, a, word, to, describe, a, long, sword, that, was, different, from, a, tachi, occurs, as, early, as, the, kamakura, period, these, references, to, uchigatana, and, tsubagatana, seem, to, indicate, a, different, style, of, sword, possibly, a, less, costly, sword, for, lower, ranking, warriors, starting, around, the, year, 1400, long, swords, signed, with, the, katana, style, mei, were, made, this, was, in, response, to, samurai, wearing, their, tachi, in, what, is, now, called, katana, style, cutting, edge, up, japanese, swords, are, traditionally, worn, with, the, mei, facing, away, from, the, wearer, when, a, tachi, was, worn, in, the, style, of, a, katana, with, the, cutting, edge, up, the, tachi, s, signature, would, be, facing, the, wrong, way, the, fact, that, swordsmiths, started, signing, swords, with, a, katana, signature, shows, that, some, samurai, of, that, time, period, had, started, wearing, their, swords, in, a, different, manner, by, the, 15th, century, japanese, swords, including, katana, had, already, gained, international, fame, by, being, exported, to, china, and, korea, for, example, korea, learned, how, to, make, japanese, swords, by, sending, swordsmiths, to, japan, and, inviting, japanese, swordsmiths, to, korea, according, to, the, record, of, june, 1, 1430, in, the, veritable, records, of, the, joseon, dynasty, a, korean, swordsmith, who, went, to, japan, and, mastered, the, method, of, making, japanese, swords, presented, a, japanese, sword, to, the, king, of, korea, and, was, rewarded, for, the, excellent, work, which, was, no, different, from, the, swords, made, by, the, japanese, traditionally, yumi, bows, were, the, main, weapon, of, war, in, japan, and, tachi, and, naginata, were, used, only, for, close, combat, the, nin, war, in, the, late, 15th, century, in, the, muromachi, period, expanded, into, a, large, scale, domestic, war, in, which, employed, farmers, called, ashigaru, were, mobilized, in, large, numbers, they, fought, on, foot, using, katana, shorter, than, tachi, in, the, sengoku, period, period, of, warring, states, in, the, late, muromachi, period, the, war, became, bigger, and, ashigaru, fought, in, a, close, formation, using, yari, spears, lent, to, them, furthermore, in, the, late, 16th, century, tanegashima, muskets, were, introduced, from, portugal, and, japanese, swordsmiths, mass, produced, improved, products, with, ashigaru, fighting, with, leased, guns, on, the, battlefield, in, japan, guns, and, spears, became, main, weapons, in, addition, to, bows, due, to, the, changes, in, fighting, styles, in, these, wars, the, tachi, and, naginata, became, obsolete, among, samurai, and, the, katana, which, was, easy, to, carry, became, the, mainstream, the, dazzling, looking, tachi, gradually, became, a, symbol, of, the, authority, of, high, ranking, samurai, on, the, other, hand, kenjutsu, swordsmanship, that, makes, use, of, the, characteristics, of, katana, was, invented, the, quicker, draw, of, the, sword, was, well, suited, to, combat, where, victory, depended, heavily, on, short, response, times, the, practice, and, martial, art, for, drawing, the, sword, quickly, and, responding, to, a, sudden, attack, was, called, batt, jutsu, which, is, still, kept, alive, through, the, teaching, of, iaido, the, katana, further, facilitated, this, by, being, worn, thrust, through, a, belt, like, sash, obi, with, the, sharpened, edge, facing, up, ideally, samurai, could, draw, the, sword, and, strike, the, enemy, in, a, single, motion, previously, the, curved, tachi, had, been, worn, with, the, edge, of, the, blade, facing, down, and, suspended, from, a, belt, from, the, 15th, century, low, quality, swords, were, mass, produced, under, the, influence, of, the, large, scale, war, these, swords, along, with, spears, were, lent, to, recruited, farmers, called, ashigaru, and, swords, were, exported, such, mass, produced, swords, are, called, kazuuchimono, and, swordsmiths, of, the, bisen, school, and, mino, school, produced, them, by, division, of, labor, the, export, of, katana, and, tachi, reached, its, peak, during, this, period, from, the, late, 15th, century, to, early, 16th, century, when, at, least, 200, 000, swords, were, shipped, to, ming, dynasty, china, in, official, trade, in, an, attempt, to, soak, up, the, production, of, japanese, weapons, and, make, it, harder, for, pirates, in, the, area, to, arm, in, the, ming, dynasty, of, china, japanese, swords, and, their, tactics, were, studied, to, repel, pirates, and, wodao, and, miaodao, were, developed, based, on, japanese, swords, from, this, period, the, tang, nakago, of, many, old, tachi, were, cut, and, shortened, into, katana, this, kind, of, remake, is, called, suriage, for, example, many, of, the, tachi, that, masamune, forged, during, the, kamakura, period, were, converted, into, katana, so, his, only, existing, works, are, katana, and, tant, from, around, the, 16th, century, many, japanese, swords, were, exported, to, thailand, where, katana, style, swords, were, made, and, prized, for, battle, and, art, work, and, some, of, them, are, in, the, collections, of, the, thai, royal, family, from, the, late, muromachi, period, sengoku, period, to, the, early, edo, period, samurai, were, sometimes, equipped, with, a, katana, blade, pointing, downwards, like, a, tachi, this, style, of, sword, is, called, handachi, half, tachi, in, handachi, both, styles, were, often, mixed, for, example, fastening, to, the, obi, was, katana, style, but, metalworking, of, the, scabbard, was, tachi, style, in, the, muromachi, period, especially, the, sengoku, period, people, such, as, farmers, townspeople, and, monks, could, have, a, sword, however, in, 1588, toyotomi, hideyoshi, banned, farmers, from, owning, weapons, and, conducted, a, sword, hunt, to, forcibly, remove, swords, from, anyone, identifying, as, a, farmer, the, length, of, the, katana, blade, varied, considerably, during, the, course, of, its, history, in, the, late, 14th, and, early, 15th, centuries, katana, blades, tended, to, have, lengths, between, 70, and, 73, centimetres, 28, and, 29, in, during, the, early, 16th, century, the, average, length, dropped, about, 10, centimetres, 3, 9, in, approaching, closer, to, 60, centimetres, 24, in, by, the, late, 16th, century, the, average, length, had, increased, again, by, about, 13, centimetres, 5, 1, in, returning, to, approximately, 73, centimetres, 29, in, swords, forged, after, 1596, in, the, keich, period, of, the, azuchi, momoyama, period, are, classified, as, shint, new, swords, japanese, swords, from, shint, are, different, from, kot, in, forging, method, and, steel, tamahagane, this, is, thought, to, be, because, bizen, school, which, was, the, largest, swordsmith, group, of, japanese, swords, was, destroyed, by, a, great, flood, in, 1590, and, the, mainstream, shifted, to, mino, school, and, because, toyotomi, hideyoshi, virtually, unified, japan, uniform, steel, began, to, be, distributed, throughout, japan, the, kot, swords, especially, the, bizen, school, swords, made, in, the, kamakura, period, had, a, midare, utsuri, like, a, white, mist, between, hamon, and, shinogi, but, in, the, swords, from, shint, it, has, almost, disappeared, in, addition, the, whole, body, of, the, blade, became, whitish, and, hard, almost, no, one, was, able, to, reproduce, midare, utsurii, until, kunihira, kawachi, reproduced, it, in, 2014, as, the, sengoku, period, period, of, warring, states, ended, and, the, azuchi, momoyama, period, to, the, edo, period, started, katana, forging, also, developed, into, a, highly, intricate, and, well, respected, art, form, lacquered, saya, scabbards, ornate, engraved, fittings, silk, handles, and, elegant, tsuba, handguards, were, popular, among, samurai, in, the, edo, period, and, eventually, especially, when, japan, was, in, peace, time, katana, became, more, cosmetic, and, ceremonial, items, than, practical, weapons, the, umetada, school, led, by, umetada, myoju, who, was, considered, to, be, the, founder, of, shinto, led, the, improvement, of, the, artistry, of, japanese, swords, in, this, period, they, were, both, swordsmiths, and, metalsmiths, and, were, famous, for, carving, the, blade, making, metal, accouterments, such, as, tsuba, handguard, remodeling, from, tachi, to, katana, suriage, and, inscriptions, inlaid, with, gold, during, this, period, the, tokugawa, shogunate, required, samurai, to, wear, katana, and, shorter, swords, in, pairs, these, short, swords, were, wakizashi, and, tant, and, wakizashi, were, mainly, selected, this, set, of, two, is, called, a, daish, only, samurai, could, wear, the, daish, it, represented, their, social, power, and, personal, honour, samurai, could, wear, decorative, sword, mountings, in, their, daily, lives, but, the, tokugawa, shogunate, regulated, the, formal, sword, that, samurai, wore, when, visiting, a, castle, by, regulating, it, as, a, daisho, made, of, a, black, scabbard, a, hilt, wrapped, with, white, ray, skin, and, black, string, japanese, swords, made, in, this, period, are, classified, as, shint, in, the, late, 18th, century, swordsmith, suishinshi, masahide, criticized, that, the, present, katana, blades, only, emphasized, decoration, and, had, a, problem, with, their, toughness, he, insisted, that, the, bold, and, strong, kot, blade, from, the, kamakura, period, to, the, nanboku, ch, period, was, the, ideal, japanese, sword, and, started, a, movement, to, restore, the, production, method, and, apply, it, to, katana, katana, made, after, this, is, classified, as, a, shinshint, one, of, the, most, popular, swordsmiths, in, japan, today, is, minamoto, kiyomaro, who, was, active, in, this, shinshint, period, his, popularity, is, due, to, his, timeless, exceptional, skill, as, he, was, nicknamed, masamune, in, yotsuya, after, his, disastrous, life, his, works, were, traded, at, high, prices, and, exhibitions, were, held, at, museums, all, over, japan, from, 2013, to, 2014, the, idea, that, the, blade, of, a, sword, in, the, kamakura, period, is, the, best, has, been, continued, until, now, and, as, of, the, 21st, century, 80, of, japanese, swords, designated, as, national, treasure, in, japan, were, made, in, the, kamakura, period, and, 70, of, them, were, tachi, the, arrival, of, matthew, perry, in, 1853, and, the, subsequent, convention, of, kanagawa, caused, chaos, in, japanese, society, conflicts, began, to, occur, frequently, between, the, forces, of, sonn, j, i, who, wanted, to, overthrow, the, tokugawa, shogunate, and, rule, by, the, emperor, and, the, forces, of, sabaku, who, wanted, the, tokugawa, shogunate, to, continue, these, political, activists, called, the, shishi, fought, using, a, practical, katana, called, the, kinn, t, or, the, bakumatsut, their, katana, were, often, longer, than, 90, cm, 35, 43, in, in, blade, length, less, curved, and, had, a, big, and, sharp, point, which, was, advantageous, for, stabbing, in, indoor, battles, during, the, meiji, period, the, samurai, class, was, gradually, disbanded, and, the, special, privileges, granted, to, them, were, taken, away, including, the, right, to, carry, swords, in, public, the, hait, rei, edict, in, 1876, forbade, the, carrying, of, swords, in, public, except, for, certain, individuals, such, as, former, samurai, lords, daimy, the, military, and, the, police, skilled, swordsmiths, had, trouble, making, a, living, during, this, period, as, japan, modernized, its, military, and, many, swordsmiths, started, making, other, items, such, as, farm, equipment, tools, and, cutlery, the, craft, of, making, swords, was, kept, alive, through, the, efforts, of, some, individuals, notably, miyamoto, kanenori, 1830, 1926, and, gassan, sadakazu, 1836, 1918, who, were, appointed, imperial, household, artist, the, businessman, mitsumura, toshimo, 1877, 1955, tried, to, preserve, their, skills, by, ordering, swords, and, sword, mountings, from, the, swordsmiths, and, craftsmen, he, was, especially, enthusiastic, about, collecting, sword, mountings, and, he, collected, about, 3, 000, precious, sword, mountings, from, the, end, of, the, edo, period, to, the, meiji, period, about, 1, 200, items, from, a, part, of, his, collection, are, now, in, the, nezu, museum, military, action, by, japan, in, china, and, russia, during, the, meiji, period, helped, revive, interest, in, swords, but, it, was, not, until, the, sh, wa, period, that, swords, were, produced, on, a, large, scale, again, japanese, military, swords, produced, between, 1875, and, 1945, are, referred, to, as, gunt, military, swords, during, the, pre, world, war, ii, military, buildup, and, throughout, the, war, all, japanese, officers, were, required, to, wear, a, sword, traditionally, made, swords, were, produced, during, this, period, but, in, order, to, supply, such, large, numbers, of, swords, blacksmiths, with, little, or, no, knowledge, of, traditional, japanese, sword, manufacture, were, also, recruited, in, addition, supplies, of, the, japanese, steel, tamahagane, used, for, swordmaking, were, limited, so, several, other, types, of, steel, were, also, used, quicker, methods, of, forging, were, also, used, such, as, the, use, of, power, hammers, and, quenching, the, blade, in, oil, rather, than, hand, forging, and, water, the, non, traditionally, made, swords, from, this, period, are, called, sh, wat, after, the, regnal, name, of, the, emperor, hirohito, and, in, 1937, the, japanese, government, started, requiring, the, use, of, special, stamps, on, the, tang, nakago, to, distinguish, these, swords, from, traditionally, made, swords, during, this, period, of, war, older, antique, swords, were, remounted, for, use, in, military, mounts, presently, in, japan, sh, wat, are, not, considered, to, be, true, japanese, swords, and, they, can, be, confiscated, outside, japan, however, they, are, collected, as, historical, artifacts, between, 1945, and, 1953, sword, manufacture, and, sword, related, martial, arts, were, banned, in, japan, many, swords, were, confiscated, and, destroyed, and, swordsmiths, were, not, able, to, make, a, living, since, 1953, japanese, swordsmiths, have, been, allowed, to, work, but, with, severe, restrictions, swordsmiths, must, be, licensed, and, serve, a, five, year, apprenticeship, and, only, licensed, swordsmiths, are, allowed, to, produce, japanese, swords, nihonto, only, two, longswords, per, month, are, allowed, to, be, produced, by, each, swordsmith, and, all, swords, must, be, registered, with, the, japanese, government, outside, japan, some, of, the, modern, katanas, being, produced, by, western, swordsmiths, use, modern, steel, alloys, such, as, l6, and, a2, these, modern, swords, replicate, the, size, and, shape, of, the, japanese, katana, and, are, used, by, martial, artists, for, iaid, and, even, for, cutting, practice, tameshigiri, mass, produced, swords, including, iait, and, shinken, in, the, shape, of, katana, are, available, from, many, countries, though, china, dominates, the, market, these, types, of, swords, are, typically, mass, produced, and, made, with, a, wide, variety, of, steels, and, methods, according, to, the, parliamentary, association, for, the, preservation, and, promotion, of, japanese, swords, organized, by, japanese, diet, members, many, katana, distributed, around, the, world, as, of, the, 21st, century, are, fake, japanese, swords, made, in, china, the, sankei, shimbun, analyzed, that, this, is, because, the, japanese, government, allowed, swordsmiths, to, make, only, 24, japanese, swords, per, person, per, year, in, order, to, maintain, the, quality, of, japanese, swords, many, swordsmiths, after, the, edo, period, have, tried, to, reproduce, the, sword, of, the, kamakura, period, which, is, considered, as, the, best, sword, in, the, history, of, japanese, swords, but, they, have, failed, then, in, 2014, kunihira, kawachi, succeeded, in, reproducing, it, and, won, the, masamune, prize, the, highest, honor, as, a, swordsmith, no, one, could, win, the, masamune, prize, unless, he, made, an, extraordinary, achievement, and, in, the, section, of, tachi, and, katana, no, one, had, won, for, 18, years, before, kawauchi, katana, are, distinguished, by, their, type, of, blade, in, addition, to, these, there, are, various, other, types, of, blades, with, different, shapes, such, as, osoraku, zukuri, unokubi, zukuri, and, kammuri, otoshi, zukuri, typical, features, of, japanese, swords, represented, by, katana, and, tachi, are, a, three, dimensional, cross, sectional, shape, of, an, elongated, pentagonal, to, hexagonal, blade, called, shinogi, zukuri, a, style, in, which, the, blade, and, the, tang, nakago, are, integrated, and, fixed, to, the, hilt, tsuka, with, a, pin, called, mekugi, and, a, gentle, curve, when, a, shinogi, zukuri, sword, is, viewed, from, the, side, there, is, a, ridge, line, of, the, thickest, part, of, the, blade, called, shinogi, between, the, cutting, edge, side, and, the, back, side, this, shinogi, contributes, to, lightening, and, toughening, of, the, blade, and, high, cutting, ability, katana, are, traditionally, made, from, a, specialized, japanese, steel, called, tamahagane, which, is, created, from, a, traditional, smelting, process, that, results, in, several, layered, steels, with, different, carbon, concentrations, this, process, helps, remove, impurities, and, even, out, the, carbon, content, of, the, steel, the, age, of, the, steel, plays, a, role, in, the, ability, to, remove, impurities, with, older, steel, having, a, higher, oxygen, concentration, being, more, easily, stretched, and, rid, of, impurities, during, hammering, resulting, in, a, stronger, blade, the, smith, begins, by, folding, and, welding, pieces, of, the, steel, several, times, to, work, out, most, of, the, differences, in, the, steel, the, resulting, block, of, steel, is, then, drawn, out, to, form, a, billet, at, this, stage, it, is, only, slightly, curved, or, may, have, no, curve, at, all, the, katana, s, gentle, curvature, is, attained, by, a, process, of, differential, hardening, or, differential, quenching, the, smith, coats, the, blade, with, several, layers, of, a, wet, clay, slurry, which, is, a, special, concoction, unique, to, each, sword, maker, but, generally, composed, of, clay, water, and, any, or, none, of, ash, grinding, stone, powder, or, rust, this, process, is, called, tsuchioki, the, edge, of, the, blade, is, coated, with, a, thinner, layer, than, the, sides, and, spine, of, the, sword, heated, and, then, quenched, in, water, few, sword, makers, use, oil, to, quench, the, blade, the, slurry, causes, only, the, blade, s, edge, to, be, hardened, and, also, causes, the, blade, to, curve, due, to, the, difference, in, densities, of, the, micro, structures, in, the, steel, when, steel, with, a, carbon, content, of, 0, 7, is, heated, beyond, 750, c, 1, 380, f, it, enters, the, austenite, phase, when, austenite, is, cooled, very, suddenly, by, quenching, in, water, the, structure, changes, into, martensite, which, is, a, very, hard, form, of, steel, when, austenite, is, allowed, to, cool, slowly, its, structure, changes, into, a, mixture, of, ferrite, and, pearlite, which, is, softer, than, martensite, this, process, also, creates, the, line, down, the, sides, of, the, blade, called, the, hamon, which, is, made, distinct, by, polishing, each, hamon, and, each, smith, s, style, of, hamon, is, distinct, hamon, does, not, refer, to, the, white, area, on, the, side, of, the, blade, the, white, part, is, the, part, that,

of, the, light, as, it, hits, the, blade, in, addition, to, these, three, objects, a, swordsmith, signature, and, a, file, pattern, engraved, on, tang, and, a, carving, inscribed, on, the, blade,
