websites, are, typically, dedicated, to, a, particular, topic, or, purpose, such, as, news, education, commerce, entertainment, or, social, media, hyperlinking, between, web, pages, guides, the, navigation, of, the, site, which, often, starts, with, a, home, page, the, most, visited, sites, are, google, youtube, and, facebook, all, publicly, accessible, websites, collectively, constitute, the, world, wide, web, there, are, also, private, websites, that, can, only, be, accessed, on, a, private, network, such, as, a, company, s, internal, website, for, its, employees, users, can, access, websites, on, a, range, of, devices, including, desktops, laptops, tablets, and, smartphones, the, app, used, on, these, devices, is, called, a, web, browser, the, world, wide, web, www, was, created, in, 1989, by, the, british, cern, computer, scientist, tim, berners, lee, on, 30, april, 1993, cern, announced, that, the, world, wide, web, would, be, free, to, use, for, anyone, contributing, to, the, immense, growth, of, the, web, before, the, introduction, of, the, hypertext, transfer, protocol, http, other, protocols, such, as, file, transfer, protocol, and, the, gopher, protocol, were, used, to, retrieve, individual, files, from, a, server, these, protocols, offer, a, simple, directory, structure, in, which, the, user, navigates, and, where, they, choose, files, to, download, documents, were, most, often, presented, as, plain, text, files, without, formatting, or, were, encoded, in, word, processor, formats, while, web, site, was, the, original, spelling, sometimes, capitalized, web, site, since, web, is, a, proper, noun, when, referring, to, the, world, wide, web, this, variant, has, become, rarely, used, and, website, has, become, the, standard, spelling, all, major, style, guides, such, as, the, chicago, manual, of, style, and, the, ap, stylebook, have, reflected, this, change, in, february, 2009, netcraft, an, internet, monitoring, company, that, has, tracked, web, growth, since, 1995, reported, that, there, were, 215, 675, 903, websites, with, domain, names, and, content, on, them, in, 2009, compared, to, just, 19, 732, websites, in, august, 1995, after, reaching, 1, billion, websites, in, september, 2014, a, milestone, confirmed, by, netcraft, in, its, october, 2014, web, server, survey, and, that, internet, live, stats, was, the, first, to, announce, as, attested, by, this, tweet, from, the, inventor, of, the, world, wide, web, himself, tim, berners, lee, the, number, of, websites, in, the, world, have, subsequently, declined, reverting, to, a, level, below, 1, billion, this, is, due, to, the, monthly, fluctuations, in, the, count, of, inactive, websites, the, number, of, websites, continued, growing, to, over, 1, billion, by, march, 2016, and, has, continued, growing, since, netcraft, web, server, survey, in, january, 2020, reported, that, there, are, 1, 295, 973, 827, websites, and, in, april, 2021, reported, that, there, are, 1, 212, 139, 815, sites, across, 10, 939, 637, web, facing, computers, and, 264, 469, 666, unique, domains, an, estimated, 85, percent, of, all, websites, are, inactive, a, static, website, is, one, that, has, web, pages, stored, on, the, server, in, the, format, that, is, sent, to, a, client, web, browser, it, is, primarily, coded, in, hypertext, markup, language, html, cascading, style, sheets, css, are, used, to, control, appearance, beyond, basic, html, images, are, commonly, used, to, create, the, desired, appearance, and, as, part, of, the, main, content, audio, or, video, might, also, be, considered, static, content, if, it, plays, automatically, or, is, generally, non, interactive, this, type, of, website, usually, displays, the, same, information, to, all, visitors, similar, to, handing, out, a, printed, brochure, to, customers, or, clients, a, static, website, will, generally, provide, consistent, standard, information, for, an, extended, period, of, time, although, the, website, owner, may, make, updates, periodically, it, is, a, manual, process, to, edit, the, text, photos, and, other, content, and, may, require, basic, website, design, skills, and, software, simple, forms, or, marketing, examples, of, websites, such, as, a, classic, website, a, five, page, website, or, a, brochure, website, are, often, static, websites, because, they, present, pre, defined, static, information, to, the, user, this, may, include, information, about, a, company, and, its, products, and, services, through, text, photos, animations, audio, video, and, navigation, menus, static, websites, may, still, use, server, side, includes, ssi, as, an, editing, convenience, such, as, sharing, a, common, menu, bar, across, many, pages, as, the, site, s, behavior, to, the, reader, is, still, static, this, is, not, considered, a, dynamic, site, a, dynamic, website, is, one, that, changes, or, customizes, itself, frequently, and, automatically, server, side, dynamic, pages, are, generated, on, the, fly, by, computer, code, that, produces, the, html, css, are, responsible, for, appearance, and, thus, are, static, files, there, are, a, wide, range, of, software, systems, such, as, cgi, java, servlets, and, java, server, pages, jsp, active, server, pages, and, coldfusion, cfml, that, are, available, to, generate, dynamic, web, systems, and, dynamic, sites, various, web, application, frameworks, and, web, template, systems, are, available, for, general, use, programming, languages, like, perl, php, python, and, ruby, to, make, it, faster, and, easier, to, create, complex, dynamic, websites, a, site, can, display, the, current, state, of, a, dialogue, between, users, monitor, a, changing, situation, or, provide, information, in, some, way, personalized, to, the, requirements, of, the, individual, user, for, example, when, the, front, page, of, a, news, site, is, requested, the, code, running, on, the, webserver, might, combine, stored, html, fragments, with, news, stories, retrieved, from, a, database, or, another, website, via, rss, to, produce, a, page, that, includes, the, latest, information, dynamic, sites, can, be, interactive, by, using, html, forms, storing, and, reading, back, browser, cookies, or, by, creating, a, series, of, pages, that, reflect, the, previous, history, of, clicks, another, example, of, dynamic, content, is, when, a, retail, website, with, a, database, of, media, products, allows, a, user, to, input, a, search, request, e, g, for, the, keyword, beatles, in, response, the, content, of, the, web, page, will, spontaneously, change, the, way, it, looked, before, and, will, then, display, a, list, of, beatles, products, like, cds, dvds, and, books, dynamic, html, uses, javascript, code, to, instruct, the, web, browser, how, to, interactively, modify, the, page, contents, one, way, to, simulate, a, certain, type, of, dynamic, website, while, avoiding, the, performance, loss, of, initiating, the, dynamic, engine, on, a, per, user, or, per, connection, basis, is, to, periodically, automatically, regenerate, a, large, series, of, static, pages, early, websites, had, only, text, and, soon, after, images, web, browser, plug, ins, were, then, used, to, add, audio, video, and, interactivity, such, as, for, a, rich, web, application, that, mirrors, the, complexity, of, a, desktop, application, like, a, word, processor, examples, of, such, plug, ins, are, microsoft, silverlight, adobe, flash, player, adobe, shockwave, player, and, java, se, html, 5, includes, provisions, for, audio, and, video, without, plugins, javascript, is, also, built, into, most, modern, web, browsers, and, allows, for, website, creators, to, send, code, to, the, web, browser, that, instructs, it, how, to, interactively, modify, page, content, and, communicate, with, the, web, server, if, needed, the, browser, s, internal, representation, of, the, content, is, known, as, the, document, object, model, dom, webgl, web, graphics, library, is, a, modern, javascript, api, for, rendering, interactive, 3d, graphics, without, the, use, of, plug, ins, it, allows, interactive, content, such, as, 3d, animations, visualizations, and, video, explainers, to, presented, users, in, the, most, intuitive, way, a, 2010, era, trend, in, websites, called, responsive, design, has, given, the, best, viewing, experience, as, it, provides, a, device, based, layout, for, users, these, websites, change, their, layout, according, to, the, device, or, mobile, platform, thus, giving, a, rich, user, experience, websites, can, be, divided, into, two, broad, categories, static, and, interactive, interactive, sites, are, part, of, the, web, 2, 0, community, of, sites, and, allow, for, interactivity, between, the, site, owner, and, site, visitors, or, users, static, sites, serve, or, capture, information, but, do, not, allow, engagement, with, the, audience, or, users, directly, some, websites, are, informational, or, produced, by, enthusiasts, or, for, personal, use, or, entertainment, many, websites, do, aim, to, make, money, using, one, or, more, business, models,
