in, the, industrial, design, field, of, human, computer, interaction, a, user, interface, ui, is, the, space, where, interactions, between, humans, and, machines, occur, the, goal, of, this, interaction, is, to, allow, effective, operation, and, control, of, the, machine, from, the, human, end, while, the, machine, simultaneously, feeds, back, information, that, aids, the, operators, decision, making, process, examples, of, this, broad, concept, of, user, interfaces, include, the, interactive, aspects, of, computer, operating, systems, hand, tools, heavy, machinery, operator, controls, and, process, controls, the, design, considerations, applicable, when, creating, user, interfaces, are, related, to, or, involve, such, disciplines, as, ergonomics, and, psychology, generally, the, goal, of, user, interface, design, is, to, produce, a, user, interface, that, makes, it, easy, efficient, and, enjoyable, user, friendly, to, operate, a, machine, in, the, way, which, produces, the, desired, result, i, e, maximum, usability, this, generally, means, that, the, operator, needs, to, provide, minimal, input, to, achieve, the, desired, output, and, also, that, the, machine, minimizes, undesired, outputs, to, the, user, user, interfaces, are, composed, of, one, or, more, layers, including, a, human, machine, interface, hmi, that, typically, interfaces, machines, with, physical, input, hardware, such, as, keyboards, mice, or, game, pads, and, output, hardware, such, as, computer, monitors, speakers, and, printers, a, device, that, implements, an, hmi, is, called, a, human, interface, device, hid, user, interfaces, that, dispense, with, the, physical, movement, of, body, parts, as, an, intermediary, step, between, the, brain, and, the, machine, use, no, input, or, output, devices, except, electrodes, alone, they, are, called, brain, computer, interfaces, bcis, or, brain, machine, interfaces, bmis, other, terms, for, human, machine, interfaces, are, man, machine, interface, mmi, and, when, the, machine, in, question, is, a, computer, human, computer, interface, additional, ui, layers, may, interact, with, one, or, more, human, senses, including, tactile, ui, touch, visual, ui, sight, auditory, ui, sound, olfactory, ui, smell, equilibria, ui, balance, and, gustatory, ui, taste, composite, user, interfaces, cuis, are, uis, that, interact, with, two, or, more, senses, the, most, common, cui, is, a, graphical, user, interface, gui, which, is, composed, of, a, tactile, ui, and, a, visual, ui, capable, of, displaying, graphics, when, sound, is, added, to, a, gui, it, becomes, a, multimedia, user, interface, mui, there, are, three, broad, categories, of, cui, standard, virtual, and, augmented, standard, cui, use, standard, human, interface, devices, like, keyboards, mice, and, computer, monitors, when, the, cui, blocks, out, the, real, world, to, create, a, virtual, reality, the, cui, is, virtual, and, uses, a, virtual, reality, interface, when, the, cui, does, not, block, out, the, real, world, and, creates, augmented, reality, the, cui, is, augmented, and, uses, an, augmented, reality, interface, when, a, ui, interacts, with, all, human, senses, it, is, called, a, qualia, interface, named, after, the, theory, of, qualia, cui, may, also, be, classified, by, how, many, senses, they, interact, with, as, either, an, x, sense, virtual, reality, interface, or, x, sense, augmented, reality, interface, where, x, is, the, number, of, senses, interfaced, with, for, example, a, smell, o, vision, is, a, 3, sense, 3s, standard, cui, with, visual, display, sound, and, smells, when, virtual, reality, interfaces, interface, with, smells, and, touch, it, is, said, to, be, a, 4, sense, 4s, virtual, reality, interface, and, when, augmented, reality, interfaces, interface, with, smells, and, touch, it, is, said, to, be, a, 4, sense, 4s, augmented, reality, interface, the, user, interface, or, human, machine, interface, is, the, part, of, the, machine, that, handles, the, human, machine, interaction, membrane, switches, rubber, keypads, and, touchscreens, are, examples, of, the, physical, part, of, the, human, machine, interface, which, we, can, see, and, touch, in, complex, systems, the, human, machine, interface, is, typically, computerized, the, term, human, computer, interface, refers, to, this, kind, of, system, in, the, context, of, computing, the, term, typically, extends, as, well, to, the, software, dedicated, to, control, the, physical, elements, used, for, human, computer, interaction, the, engineering, of, human, machine, interfaces, is, enhanced, by, considering, ergonomics, human, factors, the, corresponding, disciplines, are, human, factors, engineering, hfe, and, usability, engineering, ue, which, is, part, of, systems, engineering, tools, used, for, incorporating, human, factors, in, the, interface, design, are, developed, based, on, knowledge, of, computer, science, such, as, computer, graphics, operating, systems, programming, languages, nowadays, we, use, the, expression, graphical, user, interface, for, human, machine, interface, on, computers, as, nearly, all, of, them, are, now, using, graphics, multimodal, interfaces, allow, users, to, interact, using, more, than, one, modality, of, user, input, there, is, a, difference, between, a, user, interface, and, an, operator, interface, or, a, human, machine, interface, hmi, in, science, fiction, hmi, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, what, is, better, described, as, a, direct, neural, interface, however, this, latter, usage, is, seeing, increasing, application, in, the, real, life, use, of, medical, prostheses, the, artificial, extension, that, replaces, a, missing, body, part, e, g, cochlear, implants, in, some, circumstances, computers, might, observe, the, user, and, react, according, to, their, actions, without, specific, commands, a, means, of, tracking, parts, of, the, body, is, required, and, sensors, noting, the, position, of, the, head, direction, of, gaze, and, so, on, have, been, used, experimentally, this, is, particularly, relevant, to, immersive, interfaces, the, history, of, user, interfaces, can, be, divided, into, the, following, phases, according, to, the, dominant, type, of, user, interface, in, the, batch, era, computing, power, was, extremely, scarce, and, expensive, user, interfaces, were, rudimentary, users, had, to, accommodate, computers, rather, than, the, other, way, around, user, interfaces, were, considered, overhead, and, software, was, designed, to, keep, the, processor, at, maximum, utilization, with, as, little, overhead, as, possible, the, input, side, of, the, user, interfaces, for, batch, machines, was, mainly, punched, cards, or, equivalent, media, like, paper, tape, the, output, side, added, line, printers, to, these, media, with, the, limited, exception, of, the, system, operator, s, console, human, beings, did, not, interact, with, batch, machines, in, real, time, at, all, submitting, a, job, to, a, batch, machine, involved, first, preparing, a, deck, of, punched, cards, that, described, a, program, and, its, dataset, the, program, cards, were, not, punched, on, the, computer, itself, but, on, keypunches, specialized, typewriter, like, machines, that, were, notoriously, bulky, unforgiving, and, prone, to, mechanical, failure, the, software, interface, was, similarly, unforgiving, with, very, strict, syntaxes, designed, to, be, parsed, by, the, smallest, possible, compilers, and, interpreters, once, the, cards, were, punched, one, would, drop, them, in, a, job, queue, and, wait, eventually, operators, would, feed, the, deck, to, the, computer, perhaps, mounting, magnetic, tapes, to, supply, another, dataset, or, helper, software, the, job, would, generate, a, printout, containing, final, results, or, an, abort, notice, with, an, attached, error, log, successful, runs, might, also, write, a, result, on, magnetic, tape, or, generate, some, data, cards, to, be, used, in, a, later, computation, the, turnaround, time, for, a, single, job, often, spanned, entire, days, if, one, was, very, lucky, it, might, be, hours, there, was, no, real, time, response, but, there, were, worse, fates, than, the, card, queue, some, computers, required, an, even, more, tedious, and, error, prone, process, of, toggling, in, programs, in, binary, code, using, console, switches, the, very, earliest, machines, had, to, be, partly, rewired, to, incorporate, program, logic, into, themselves, using, devices, known, as, plugboards, early, batch, systems, gave, the, currently, running, job, the, entire, computer, program, decks, and, tapes, had, to, include, what, we, would, now, think, of, as, operating, system, code, to, talk, to, i, o, devices, and, do, whatever, other, housekeeping, was, needed, midway, through, the, batch, period, after, 1957, various, groups, began, to, experiment, with, so, called, load, and, go, systems, these, used, a, monitor, program, which, was, always, resident, on, the, computer, programs, could, call, the, monitor, for, services, another, function, of, the, monitor, was, to, do, better, error, checking, on, submitted, jobs, catching, errors, earlier, and, more, intelligently, and, generating, more, useful, feedback, to, the, users, thus, monitors, represented, the, first, step, towards, both, operating, systems, and, explicitly, designed, user, interfaces, command, line, interfaces, clis, evolved, from, batch, monitors, connected, to, the, system, console, their, interaction, model, was, a, series, of, request, response, transactions, with, requests, expressed, as, textual, commands, in, a, specialized, vocabulary, latency, was, far, lower, than, for, batch, systems, dropping, from, days, or, hours, to, seconds, accordingly, command, line, systems, allowed, the, user, to, change, their, mind, about, later, stages, of, the, transaction, in, response, to, real, time, or, near, real, time, feedback, on, earlier, results, software, could, be, exploratory, and, interactive, in, ways, not, possible, before, but, these, interfaces, still, placed, a, relatively, heavy, mnemonic, load, on, the, user, requiring, a, serious, investment, of, effort, and, learning, time, to, master, the, earliest, command, line, systems, combined, teleprinters, with, computers, adapting, a, mature, technology, that, had, proven, effective, for, mediating, the, transfer, of, information, over, wires, between, human, beings, teleprinters, had, originally, been, invented, as, devices, for, automatic, telegraph, transmission, and, reception, they, had, a, history, going, back, to, 1902, and, had, already, become, well, established, in, newsrooms, and, elsewhere, by, 1920, in, reusing, them, economy, was, certainly, a, consideration, but, psychology, and, the, rule, of, least, surprise, mattered, as, well, teleprinters, provided, a, point, of, interface, with, the, system, that, was, familiar, to, many, engineers, and, users, the, widespread, adoption, of, video, display, terminals, vdts, in, the, mid, 1970s, ushered, in, the, second, phase, of, command, line, systems, these, cut, latency, further, because, characters, could, be, thrown, on, the, phosphor, dots, of, a, screen, more, quickly, than, a, printer, head, or, carriage, can, move, they, helped, quell, conservative, resistance, to, interactive, programming, by, cutting, ink, and, paper, consumables, out, of, the, cost, picture, and, were, to, the, first, tv, generation, of, the, late, 1950s, and, 60s, even, more, iconic, and, comfortable, than, teleprinters, had, been, to, the, computer, pioneers, of, the, 1940s, just, as, importantly, the, existence, of, an, accessible, screen, a, two, dimensional, display, of, text, that, could, be, rapidly, and, reversibly, modified, made, it, economical, for, software, designers, to, deploy, interfaces, that, could, be, described, as, visual, rather, than, textual, the, pioneering, applications, of, this, kind, were, computer, games, and, text, editors, close, descendants, of, some, of, the, earliest, specimens, such, as, rogue, 6, and, vi, 1, are, still, a, live, part, of, unix, tradition, in, 1985, with, the, beginning, of, microsoft, windows, and, other, graphical, user, interfaces, ibm, created, what, is, called, the, systems, application, architecture, saa, standard, which, include, the, common, user, access, cua, derivative, cua, successfully, created, what, we, know, and, use, today, in, windows, and, most, of, the, more, recent, dos, or, windows, console, applications, will, use, that, standard, as, well, this, defined, that, a, pulldown, menu, system, should, be, at, the, top, of, the, screen, status, bar, at, the, bottom, shortcut, keys, should, stay, the, same, for, all, common, functionality, f2, to, open, for, example, would, work, in, all, applications, that, followed, the, saa, standard, this, greatly, helped, the, speed, at, which, users, could, learn, an, application, so, it, caught, on, quick, and, became, an, industry, standard, primary, methods, used, in, the, interface, design, include, prototyping, and, simulation, typical, human, machine, interface, design, consists, of, the, following, stages, interaction, specification, interface, software, specification, and, prototyping, in, broad, terms, interfaces, generally, regarded, as, user, friendly, efficient, intuitive, etc, are, typified, by, one, or, more, particular, qualities, for, the, purpose, of, example, a, non, exhaustive, list, of, such, characteristics, follows, the, principle, of, least, astonishment, pola, is, a, general, principle, in, the, design, of, all, kinds, of, interfaces, it, is, based, on, the, idea, that, human, beings, can, only, pay, full, attention, to, one, thing, at, one, time, leading, to, the, conclusion, that, novelty, should, be, minimized, if, an, interface, is, used, persistently, the, user, will, unavoidably, develop, habits, for, using, the, interface, the, designer, s, role, can, thus, be, characterized, as, ensuring, the, user, forms, good, habits, if, the, designer, is, experienced, with, other, interfaces, they, will, similarly, develop, habits, and, often, make, unconscious, assumptions, regarding, how, the, user, will, interact, with, the, interface, peter, morville, of, google, designed, the, user, experience, honeycomb, framework, in, 2004, when, leading, operations, in, user, interface, design, the, framework, was, created, to, guide, user, interface, design, it, would, act, as, a, guideline, for, many, web, development, students, for, a, decade
