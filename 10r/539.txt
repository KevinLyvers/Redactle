a, shotgun, also, known, as, a, scattergun, peppergun, or, historically, as, a, fowling, piece, is, a, long, barreled, firearm, designed, to, shoot, a, straight, walled, cartridge, known, as, a, shotshell, which, discharges, numerous, small, spherical, projectiles, called, shot, or, a, single, solid, projectile, called, a, slug, shotguns, are, most, commonly, used, as, smoothbore, firearms, meaning, that, their, gun, barrels, have, no, rifling, on, the, inner, wall, but, rifled, barrels, for, shooting, sabot, slugs, slug, barrels, are, also, available, shotguns, come, in, a, wide, variety, of, calibers, and, gauges, ranging, from, 5, 5, mm, 22, inch, to, up, to, 5, cm, 2, 0, in, though, the, 12, gauge, 18, 53, mm, or, 0, 729, in, and, 20, gauge, 15, 63, mm, or, 0, 615, in, bores, are, by, far, the, most, common, almost, all, are, breechloading, and, can, be, single, barreled, double, barreled, or, in, the, form, of, a, combination, gun, like, rifles, shotguns, also, come, in, a, range, of, different, action, types, both, single, shot, and, repeating, for, non, repeating, designs, over, and, under, and, side, by, side, break, action, shotguns, are, by, far, the, most, common, variants, although, revolving, shotguns, do, exist, most, modern, repeating, shotguns, are, either, pump, action, or, semi, automatic, and, also, fully, automatic, lever, action, or, bolt, action, to, a, lesser, extent, preceding, smoothbore, firearms, such, as, the, musket, were, widely, used, by, european, militaries, from, the, 17th, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, muzzleloading, blunderbuss, the, direct, ancestor, of, the, shotgun, was, also, used, in, similar, roles, from, self, defense, to, riot, control, shotguns, were, often, favored, by, cavalry, troops, in, the, early, to, mid, 19th, century, because, of, its, ease, of, use, and, generally, good, effectiveness, on, the, move, as, well, as, by, coachmen, for, its, substantial, power, but, by, the, late, 19th, century, these, weapons, became, largely, replaced, on, the, battlefield, by, breechloading, rifled, firearms, shooting, spin, stabilized, cylindro, conoidal, bullets, which, were, far, more, accurate, with, longer, effective, ranges, the, military, value, of, shotguns, was, rediscovered, in, the, first, world, war, when, american, forces, used, the, pump, action, winchester, model, 1897, shotgun, in, trench, fighting, to, great, effect, since, then, shotguns, have, been, used, in, a, variety, of, close, quarters, combat, roles, in, civilian, law, enforcement, and, military, applications, the, smoothbore, shotgun, barrel, generates, less, resistance, and, thus, allows, greater, propellant, loads, for, heavier, projectiles, without, as, much, risk, of, overpressure, or, a, squib, load, and, are, also, easier, to, clean, the, shot, pellets, from, a, shotshell, are, propelled, indirectly, through, a, wadding, inside, the, shell, and, scatter, upon, leaving, the, barrel, which, is, usually, choked, at, the, muzzle, end, to, control, the, projectile, scatter, this, means, each, shotgun, discharge, will, produce, a, cluster, of, impact, points, instead, of, a, single, point, of, impact, like, other, firearms, having, multiple, projectiles, also, means, the, muzzle, energy, is, divided, among, the, pellets, leaving, each, individual, projectile, with, less, penetrative, kinetic, energy, the, lack, of, spin, stabilization, and, the, generally, suboptimal, aerodynamic, shape, of, the, shot, pellets, also, make, them, less, accurate, and, decelerate, quite, quickly, in, flight, due, to, drag, giving, shotguns, short, effective, ranges, in, a, hunting, context, this, makes, shotguns, useful, primarily, for, hunting, fast, flying, birds, and, other, agile, small, medium, sized, game, without, risking, overpenetration, and, stray, shots, to, distant, bystander, and, objects, however, in, a, military, or, law, enforcement, context, the, high, short, range, blunt, knockback, force, and, large, number, of, projectiles, makes, the, shotgun, useful, as, a, door, breaching, tool, a, crowd, control, or, close, quarters, defensive, weapon, militants, or, insurgents, may, use, shotguns, in, asymmetric, engagements, as, shotguns, are, commonly, owned, civilian, weapons, in, many, countries, shotguns, are, also, used, for, target, shooting, sports, such, as, skeet, trap, and, sporting, clays, which, involve, flying, clay, disks, known, as, clay, pigeons, thrown, in, various, ways, by, a, dedicated, launching, device, called, a, trap, the, action, is, the, operating, mechanism, of, a, gun, there, are, many, types, of, shotguns, typically, categorized, by, the, number, of, barrels, or, the, way, the, gun, is, reloaded, for, most, of, the, history, of, the, shotgun, the, breechloading, break, action, shotgun, was, the, most, common, type, and, double, barreled, variants, are, by, far, the, most, commonly, seen, in, modern, days, these, are, typically, divided, into, two, subtypes, the, traditional, side, by, side, shotgun, features, two, barrels, mounted, horizontally, beside, each, other, as, the, name, suggests, whereas, the, over, and, under, shotgun, has, the, two, barrels, mounted, vertically, one, on, top, of, the, other, side, by, side, shotguns, were, traditionally, used, for, hunting, and, other, sporting, pursuits, early, long, barreled, side, by, side, shotguns, were, known, as, fowling, pieces, for, their, use, hunting, ducks, and, other, waterbirds, as, well, as, some, landfowls, whereas, over, and, under, shotguns, are, more, commonly, associated, with, recreational, use, such, as, clay, pigeon, shooting, both, types, of, double, barrel, shotgun, are, used, for, hunting, and, sporting, use, with, the, individual, configuration, largely, being, a, matter, of, personal, preference, another, less, commonly, encountered, type, of, break, action, shotgun, is, the, combination, gun, which, is, an, over, and, under, design, with, one, smoothbore, barrel, and, one, rifle, barrel, more, often, with, a, rifle, barrel, on, top, but, a, rifle, barrel, on, bottom, was, not, uncommon, there, is, also, a, class, of, break, action, guns, called, drillings, which, contain, three, barrels, usually, two, smoothbore, barrels, of, the, same, gauge, and, a, rifled, barrel, though, the, only, common, theme, is, that, at, least, one, barrel, be, smoothbore, the, most, common, arrangement, was, essentially, a, side, by, side, shotgun, with, the, rifled, barrel, below, and, centered, usually, a, drilling, containing, more, than, one, rifled, barrel, would, have, both, rifled, barrels, in, the, same, caliber, but, examples, do, exist, with, different, caliber, barrels, usually, a, 22, long, rifle, and, a, centerfire, cartridge, although, very, rare, drillings, with, three, and, even, four, a, vierling, shotgun, barrels, were, made, in, pump, action, shotguns, a, linearly, sliding, fore, end, handguard, i, e, pump, is, manually, moved, back, and, forth, like, a, hand, pump, to, work, the, action, extracting, the, spent, shell, and, inserting, a, new, round, while, cocking, the, hammer, or, striker, a, pump, action, shotgun, is, typically, fed, from, a, tubular, magazine, underneath, the, barrel, which, also, serves, as, a, guide, rail, for, the, pump, the, rounds, are, fed, in, one, by, one, through, a, port, in, the, receiver, where, they, are, lifted, by, a, lever, called, the, elevator, and, pushed, forward, into, the, chamber, by, the, bolt, a, pair, of, latches, at, the, rear, of, the, magazine, hold, the, rounds, in, place, and, facilitate, feeding, of, one, shell, at, a, time, if, it, is, desired, to, load, the, gun, fully, a, round, may, be, loaded, through, the, ejection, port, directly, into, the, chamber, or, cycled, from, the, magazine, which, is, then, topped, off, with, another, round, well, known, examples, include, the, winchester, model, 1897, remington, 870, and, mossberg, 500, 590, pump, action, shotguns, are, common, hunting, fowling, and, sporting, shotguns, hunting, models, generally, have, a, barrel, between, 600, and, 700, mm, 24, 28, tube, fed, models, designed, for, hunting, often, come, with, a, dowel, rod, or, other, stop, that, is, inserted, into, the, magazine, and, reduces, the, capacity, of, the, gun, to, three, shells, two, in, the, magazine, and, one, chambered, as, is, mandated, by, u, s, federal, law, when, hunting, migratory, birds, they, can, also, easily, be, used, with, an, empty, magazine, as, a, single, shot, weapon, by, simply, dropping, the, next, round, to, be, fired, into, the, open, ejection, port, after, the, spent, round, is, ejected, for, this, reason, pump, actions, are, commonly, used, to, teach, novice, shooters, under, supervision, as, the, trainer, can, load, each, round, more, quickly, than, with, a, break, action, while, unlike, a, break, action, the, student, can, maintain, his, grip, on, the, gun, and, concentrate, on, proper, handling, and, firing, of, the, weapon, pump, action, shotguns, with, shorter, barrels, and, little, or, no, barrel, choke, are, highly, popular, for, use, in, home, defense, military, and, law, enforcement, and, are, commonly, known, as, riot, guns, the, minimum, barrel, length, for, shotguns, in, most, of, the, u, s, is, 18, inches, 460, mm, and, this, barrel, length, sometimes, 18, 5, 20, in, 470, 510, mm, to, increase, magazine, capacity, and, or, ensure, the, gun, is, legal, regardless, of, measuring, differences, is, the, primary, choice, for, riot, shotguns, the, shorter, barrel, makes, the, weapon, easier, to, maneuver, around, corners, and, in, tight, spaces, though, slightly, longer, barrels, are, sometimes, used, outdoors, for, a, tighter, spread, pattern, or, increased, accuracy, of, slug, projectiles, home, defense, and, law, enforcement, shotguns, are, usually, chambered, for, 12, gauge, shells, providing, maximum, shot, power, and, the, use, of, a, variety, of, projectiles, such, as, buckshot, rubber, sandbag, and, slug, shells, but, 20, gauge, common, in, bird, hunting, shotguns, or, 410, common, in, youth, size, shotguns, are, also, available, in, defense, type, shotgun, models, allowing, easier, use, by, novice, shooters, a, riot, shotgun, has, many, advantages, over, a, handgun, or, rifle, compared, to, defense, caliber, handguns, chambered, for, 9mm, parabellum, 38, special, 357, magnum, 40, s, w, 45, acp, and, similar, a, shotgun, has, far, more, power, and, damage, potential, up, to, 10, times, the, muzzle, energy, of, a, 45, acp, cartridge, allowing, a, one, shot, stop, that, is, more, difficult, to, achieve, with, typical, handgun, loads, compared, to, a, rifle, riot, shotguns, are, easier, to, maneuver, due, to, the, shorter, barrel, still, provide, better, damage, potential, at, indoor, distances, generally, 3, 5, meters, yards, and, reduce, the, risk, of, overpenetration, that, is, the, bullet, or, shot, passing, completely, through, the, target, and, continuing, beyond, which, poses, a, risk, to, those, behind, the, target, through, walls, the, wide, spread, of, the, shot, reduces, the, importance, of, shot, placement, compared, to, a, single, projectile, which, increases, the, effectiveness, of, point, shooting, rapidly, aiming, simply, by, pointing, the, weapon, in, the, direction, of, the, target, this, allows, easy, fast, use, by, novices, early, attempts, at, repeating, shotguns, invariably, centred, around, either, bolt, or, lever, action, designs, drawing, inspiration, from, contemporary, repeating, rifles, with, the, earliest, successful, repeating, shotgun, being, the, lever, action, winchester, m1887, designed, by, john, browning, at, the, behest, of, the, winchester, repeating, arms, company, lever, shotguns, while, less, common, were, popular, in, the, late, 19th, century, with, the, winchester, model, 1887, and, model, 1901, being, prime, examples, initially, very, popular, demand, waned, after, the, introduction, of, pump, action, shotguns, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, and, production, was, eventually, discontinued, in, 1920, one, major, issue, with, lever, actions, and, to, a, lesser, extent, pump, actions, was, that, early, shotgun, shells, were, often, made, of, paper, or, similar, fragile, materials, modern, hulls, are, plastic, or, metal, as, a, result, the, loading, of, shells, or, working, of, the, action, of, the, shotgun, could, often, result, in, cartridges, getting, crushed, and, becoming, unusable, or, even, damaging, the, gun, lever, shotguns, have, seen, a, return, to, the, gun, market, in, recent, years, however, with, winchester, producing, the, model, 9410, chambering, the, 410, gauge, shotgun, shell, and, using, the, action, of, the, winchester, model, 94, series, lever, action, rifle, hence, the, name, and, a, handful, of, other, firearm, manufacturers, primarily, norinco, of, china, and, adi, ltd, of, australia, producing, versions, of, the, winchester, model, 1887, 1901, designed, for, modern, 12, gauge, smokeless, shotshells, with, more, durable, plastic, casings, there, has, been, a, notable, uptick, in, lever, action, shotgun, sales, in, australia, since, 1997, when, pump, actions, were, effectively, outlawed, bolt, action, shotguns, while, uncommon, do, exist, one, of, the, best, known, examples, is, a, 12, gauge, manufactured, by, mossberg, featuring, a, 3, round, magazine, marketed, in, australia, just, after, changes, to, the, gun, laws, in, 1997, heavily, restricted, the, ownership, and, use, of, pump, action, and, semi, automatic, shotguns, they, were, not, a, huge, success, as, they, were, somewhat, slow, and, awkward, to, operate, and, the, rate, of, fire, was, noticeably, slower, on, average, than, a, double, barrelled, gun, the, rifle, factory, ishapore, in, india, also, manufactured, a, single, shot, 410, bore, shotgun, based, on, the, smle, mk, iii, rifle, the, russian, berdana, shotgun, was, effectively, a, single, shot, bolt, action, rifle, that, became, obsolete, and, was, subsequently, modified, to, chamber, 16, gauge, shotgun, shells, for, civilian, sale, the, u, s, military, m26, is, also, a, bolt, action, weapon, bolt, action, shotguns, have, also, been, used, in, the, goose, gun, application, intended, to, kill, birds, such, as, geese, at, greater, range, typically, goose, guns, have, long, barrels, up, to, 36, inches, and, small, bolt, fed, magazines, bolt, action, shotguns, are, also, used, in, conjunction, with, slug, shells, for, the, maximum, possible, accuracy, from, a, shotgun, in, australia, some, straight, pull, bolt, action, shotguns, such, as, the, turkish, made, pardus, ba12, and, dickinson, t1000, the, american, c, more, competition, m26, as, well, as, the, indigenous, designed, shs, stp, 12, have, become, increasingly, popular, alternatives, to, lever, action, shotguns, largely, due, to, the, better, ergonomics, with, less, stress, on, the, shooter, s, trigger, hand, and, fingers, when, cycling, the, action, colt, briefly, manufactured, several, revolving, shotguns, that, were, met, with, mixed, success, the, colt, model, 1839, shotgun, was, manufactured, between, 1839, and, 1841, later, the, colt, model, 1855, shotgun, based, on, the, model, 1855, revolving, rifle, was, manufactured, between, 1860, and, 1863, because, of, their, low, production, numbers, and, age, they, are, among, the, rarest, of, all, colt, firearms, the, armsel, striker, was, a, modern, take, on, the, revolving, shotgun, that, held, 10, rounds, of, 12, gauge, ammunition, in, its, cylinder, it, was, copied, by, cobray, as, the, streetsweeper, taurus, manufactures, a, carbine, variant, of, the, taurus, judge, revolver, along, with, its, australian, partner, company, rossi, known, as, the, taurus, rossi, circuit, judge, it, comes, in, the, original, combination, chambering, of, 410, bore, and, 45, long, colt, as, well, as, the, 44, remington, magnum, chambering, the, rifle, has, small, blast, shields, attached, to, the, cylinder, to, protect, the, shooter, from, hot, gases, escaping, between, the, cylinder, and, barrel, the, mts255, russian, 255, is, a, shotgun, fed, by, a, 5, round, internal, revolving, cylinder, it, is, produced, by, the, tskib, soo, central, design, and, research, bureau, of, sporting, and, hunting, arms, they, are, available, in, 12, 20, 28, and, 32, gauges, and, 410, bore, recoil, inertia, driven, or, gas, operated, actions, are, other, popular, methods, of, increasing, the, rate, of, fire, of, a, shotgun, these, self, loading, shotguns, are, generally, referred, to, as, autoloaders, instead, of, having, the, action, manually, operated, by, a, pump, or, lever, the, action, automatically, cycles, each, time, the, shotgun, is, fired, ejecting, the, spent, shell, and, reloading, a, fresh, one, into, the, chamber, the, first, successful, semi, automatic, shotgun, was, john, browning, s, auto, 5, first, produced, by, fabrique, nationale, beginning, in, 1902, other, well, known, examples, include, the, remington, 1100, benelli, m1, and, saiga, 12, some, such, as, the, franchi, spas, 12, and, benelli, m3, are, capable, of, switching, between, semi, automatic, and, pump, action, these, are, popular, for, two, reasons, first, some, jurisdictions, forbid, the, use, of, semi, automatic, actions, for, hunting, and, second, lower, powered, rounds, like, reduced, recoil, buckshot, shells, and, many, less, lethal, cartridges, have, insufficient, power, to, reliably, cycle, a, semi, automatic, shotgun, fully, automatic, shotguns, such, as, the, 1960, s, appeared, in, 1967, vietnam, war, era, remington, model, 7188, designed, for, and, used, by, us, navy, seals, in, vietnam, the, auto, assault, 12, aa, 12, or, the, usas, 12, also, exist, but, they, are, still, rare, in, addition, to, the, commonly, encountered, shotgun, actions, already, listed, there, are, also, shotguns, based, on, the, martini, henry, rifle, design, originally, designed, by, british, arms, maker, w, w, greener, some, of, the, more, interesting, advances, in, shotgun, technology, include, the, versatile, neostead, 2000, and, fully, automatics, such, as, the, pancor, jackhammer, or, auto, assault, 12, in, 1925, rodolfo, cosmi, produced, the, first, working, prototype, hybrid, semi, automatic, shotgun, which, had, an, 8, round, magazine, located, in, the, stock, while, it, reloaded, automatically, after, each, shot, like, a, semi, automatic, it, had, a, break, action, to, load, the, first, shell, this, design, has, only, been, repeated, once, by, beretta, with, their, ugb25, automatic, shotgun, the, user, loads, the, first, shell, by, breaking, the, gun, in, the, manner, of, a, break, action, shotgun, then, closes, it, and, inserts, the, second, shell, into, a, clip, on, the, gun, s, right, side, the, spent, hulls, are, ejected, downwards, the, guns, combine, the, advantages, of, the, break, action, they, can, be, proven, to, be, safe, by, breaking, open, there, are, no, flying, hulls, with, those, of, the, semi, automatic, low, recoil, low, barrel, axis, position, hence, low, muzzle, flip, the, italian, firearms, manufacturer, benelli, armi, spa, also, makes, the, benelli, m3, a, dual, mode, hybrid, shotgun, that, allows, the, user, the, choice, of, semi, automatic, or, pump, action, operation, pump, action, operation, is, employed, when, shooting, less, energetic, shells, such, as, baton, rounds, that, do, not, generate, enough, recoil, to, operate, the, semi, automatic, mechanism, conversely, the, semi, automatic, mode, can, be, employed, with, more, powerful, shells, absorbing, some, of, the, recoil, switching, between, the, two, modes, is, done, by, manipulating, the, ring, located, at, the, front, of, the, foregrip, the, french, firearm, manufacturer, verney, carron, produces, the, v, loce, shotgun, a, lever, release, blowback, firearm, using, bolt, catch, mechanism, like, its, similarly, designed, speedline, rifle, the, v, loce, is, in, essence, a, modified, inertia, driven, semi, automatic, shotgun, but, after, blowback, the, bolt, is, trapped, by, a, bolt, stop, and, cannot, return, to, battery, unless, it, is, manually, released, by, depressing, a, thumb, lever, near, the, tang, of, the, grip, because, the, gun, will, not, chamber, a, new, round, without, manual, actuation, the, design, is, technically, not, really, a, self, loading, and, verney, carron, described, it, as, a, manual, repeating, shotgun, when, australian, firearm, dealers, tried, to, import, the, v, loce, shotgun, in, 2018, greens, david, shoebridge, and, anti, gun, groups, such, as, gun, control, australia, caused, a, moral, panic, on, the, mainstream, media, calling, it, semi, semi, automatic, that, needed, to, be, prohibited, as, a, rapid, fire, weapon, the, gauge, number, is, determined, by, the, weight, in, fractions, of, a, pound, of, a, solid, sphere, of, lead, with, a, diameter, equal, to, the, inside, diameter, of, the, barrel, so, a, 10, gauge, shotgun, nominally, should, have, an, inside, diameter, equal, to, that, of, a, sphere, made, from, one, tenth, of, a, pound, of, lead, each, gauge, has, a, set, caliber, by, far, the, most, common, gauges, are, 12, 0, 729, in, 18, 5mm, diameter, and, 20, 0, 614, in, 15, 6mm, this, includes, other, more, or, less, common, gauges, such, as, the, 10, 16, 24, 28, 32, and, 67, 410, bore, gauge, different, gauges, have, different, typical, applications, 12, gauge, shotguns, are, common, for, hunting, geese, large, ducks, or, other, big, larger, gamebirds, professional, skeet, and, trap, shooting, military, applications, and, home, defense, applications, 16, gauge, shotguns, were, once, common, for, hunters, who, wanted, to, use, only, a, single, shotgun, for, gamebirds, normally, pursued, with, 12, or, 20, gauge, shotguns, but, have, become, rarer, in, recent, years, 20, gauge, shotguns, are, often, used, for, gamebirds, such, as, doves, smaller, ducks, and, quail, 28, gauge, shotguns, are, not, as, common, but, are, classic, quail, hunting, guns, 410, gauge, shotguns, are, typically, used, for, squirrel, hunting, or, for, sportsmen, seeking, the, challenge, of, killing, game, with, a, smaller, load, other, less, common, shotgun, cartridges, have, their, own, unique, uses, ammunition, manufacturer, cci, produces, 9mm, parabellum, 355, in, and, several, other, popular, pistol, calibers, up, to, 45, acp, 11, 43mm, as, well, as, smaller, calibers, such, as, 22, long, rifle, 5, 5mm, and, 22, magnum, 5, 5mm, these, are, commonly, called, snake, shot, cartridges, larger, gauges, up, to, 4, bore, too, powerful, to, shoulder, have, been, built, but, were, generally, affixed, to, small, boats, and, referred, to, as, punt, guns, these, were, used, for, commercial, waterfowl, hunting, to, kill, large, numbers, of, birds, resting, on, the, water, handguns, have, also, been, produced, that, are, capable, of, firing, either, 45, long, colt, or, 410, shotgun, shells, from, the, same, chamber, they, are, commonly, known, as, snake, guns, derringers, such, as, the, snake, slayer, and, cowboy, defender, are, popular, among, some, outdoors, men, in, the, south, and, southwest, regions, of, the, united, states, there, are, also, some, revolvers, such, as, the, taurus, judge, and, smith, wesson, governor, that, are, capable, of, shooting, the, 45lc, 410, rounds, but, as, with, derringers, they, are, not, considered, shotguns, the, 410, bore, 10, 4, mm, is, unusual, being, measured, in, inches, and, would, be, approximately, 67, real, gauge, though, its, short, hull, versions, are, nominally, called, 36, gauge, in, europe, it, uses, a, relatively, small, charge, of, shot, it, is, used, for, hunting, and, for, skeet, because, of, its, very, light, recoil, approx, 10, n, it, is, often, used, as, a, beginner, s, gun, however, the, small, charge, and, typically, tight, choke, make, it, more, difficult, to, hit, targets, it, is, also, frequently, used, by, expert, shooters, because, of, the, difficulty, especially, in, expensive, side, by, side, and, over, under, models, for, hunting, small, bird, game, such, as, quail, and, doves, inexpensive, bolt, action, 410, shotguns, are, a, very, common, first, hunting, shotgun, among, young, pre, teen, hunters, as, they, are, used, mostly, for, hunting, squirrels, while, additionally, teaching, bolt, action, manipulation, skills, that, will, transfer, easily, later, to, adult, sized, hunting, rifles, most, of, these, young, hunters, move, up, to, a, 20, gauge, within, a, few, years, and, to, 12, gauge, shotguns, and, full, size, hunting, rifles, by, their, late, teens, still, many, who, are, particularly, recoil, averse, choose, to, stay, with, 20, gauge, shotguns, all, their, adult, life, as, it, is, a, suitable, gauge, for, many, popular, hunting, uses, a, recent, innovation, is, the, back, boring, of, barrels, in, which, the, barrels, are, bored, out, slightly, larger, than, their, actual, gauge, this, reduces, the, compression, forces, on, the, shot, when, it, transitions, from, the, chamber, to, the, barrel, this, leads, to, a, slight, reduction, in, perceived, recoil, and, an, improvement, in, shot, pattern, due, to, reduced, deformation, of, the, shot, most, shotguns, are, used, to, fire, a, number, of, ball, shot, in, addition, to, slugs, and, sabots, the, ball, shot, or, pellets, is, for, the, most, part, made, of, lead, but, this, has, been, partially, replaced, by, bismuth, steel, tungsten, iron, tungsten, nickel, iron, and, even, tungsten, polymer, loads, non, toxic, loads, are, required, by, federal, law, for, waterfowl, hunting, in, the, us, as, the, shot, may, be, ingested, by, the, waterfowl, which, some, authorities, believe, can, lead, to, health, problems, due, to, the, lead, exposure, shot, is, termed, either, birdshot, or, buckshot, depending, on, the, shot, size, informally, birdshot, pellets, have, a, diameter, smaller, than, 5, mm, 0, 20, in, and, buckshot, are, larger, than, that, pellet, size, is, indicated, by, a, number, for, bird, shot, this, ranges, from, the, smallest, 12, 1, 2, mm, 0, 05, in, to, 2, 3, 8, mm, 0, 15, in, and, then, bb, 4, 6, mm, 0, 18, in, for, buckshot, the, numbers, start, and, end, with, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, single, aught, 00, double, aught, 000, triple, aught, and, 0000, quadruple, aught, a, different, informal, distinction, is, that, bird, shot, pellets, are, small, enough, that, they, can, be, measured, into, the, cartridge, by, weight, and, simply, poured, in, whereas, buckshot, pellets, are, so, large, they, must, be, stacked, inside, the, cartridge, in, a, fixed, geometric, arrangement, to, fit, the, diameter, in, hundredths, of, an, inch, of, bird, shot, sizes, from, no, 9, to, no, 1, can, be, obtained, by, subtracting, the, shot, size, from, 17, thus, no, 4, bird, shot, is, 17, 4, 13, 0, 13, inches, 3, 3, mm, in, diameter, different, terminology, is, used, outside, the, united, states, in, england, and, australia, for, example, 00, buckshot, cartridges, are, commonly, referred, to, as, s, g, swanshot, gauge, cartridges, shot, small, and, round, and, delivered, without, spin, is, ballistically, inefficient, as, the, shot, leaves, the, barrel, it, begins, to, disperse, in, the, air, the, resulting, cloud, of, pellets, is, known, as, the, shot, pattern, or, shotgun, shot, spread, the, ideal, pattern, would, be, a, circle, with, an, even, distribution, of, shot, throughout, with, a, density, sufficient, to, ensure, enough, pellets, will, intersect, the, target, to, achieve, the, desired, result, such, as, a, kill, when, hunting, or, a, break, when, shooting, clay, targets, in, reality, the, pattern, is, closer, to, a, gaussian, or, normal, distribution, with, a, higher, density, in, the, center, that, tapers, off, at, the, edges, patterns, are, usually, measured, by, firing, at, a, 30, inch, 76, cm, diameter, circle, on, a, large, sheet, of, paper, placed, at, varying, distances, the, hits, inside, the, circle, are, counted, and, compared, to, the, total, number, of, pellets, and, the, density, of, the, pattern, inside, the, circle, is, examined, an, ideal, pattern, would, put, nearly, 100, of, the, pellets, in, the, circle, and, would, have, no, voids, any, region, where, a, target, silhouette, will, fit, and, not, cover, 3, or, more, holes, is, considered, a, potential, problem, a, constriction, in, the, end, of, the, barrel, known, as, the, choke, is, used, to, tailor, the, pattern, for, different, purposes, chokes, may, either, be, formed, as, part, of, the, barrel, at, the, time, of, manufacture, by, squeezing, the, end, of, the, bore, down, over, a, mandrel, or, by, threading, the, barrel, and, screwing, in, an, interchangeable, choke, tube, the, choke, typically, consists, of, a, conical, section, that, smoothly, tapers, from, the, bore, diameter, down, to, the, choke, diameter, followed, by, a, cylindrical, section, of, the, choke, diameter, briley, manufacturing, a, maker, of, interchangeable, shotgun, chokes, uses, a, conical, portion, about, three, times, the, bore, diameter, in, length, so, the, shot, is, gradually, squeezed, down, with, minimal, deformation, the, cylindrical, section, is, shorter, usually, 0, 6, to, 0, 75, inches, 15, to, 19, millimetres, the, use, of, interchangeable, chokes, has, made, it, easy, to, tune, the, performance, of, a, given, combination, of, shotgun, and, shotshell, to, achieve, the, desired, performance, the, choke, should, be, tailored, to, the, range, and, size, of, the, targets, a, skeet, shooter, shooting, at, close, targets, might, use, 127, micrometres, 0, 005, inches, of, constriction, to, produce, a, 76, cm, 30, in, diameter, pattern, at, a, distance, of, 19, m, 21, yd, a, trap, shooter, shooting, at, distant, targets, might, use, 762, micrometres, 0, 030, inches, of, constriction, to, produce, a, 76, cm, 30, in, diameter, pattern, at, 37, m, 40, yd, special, chokes, for, turkey, hunting, which, requires, long, range, shots, at, the, small, head, and, neck, of, the, bird, can, go, as, high, as, 1500, micrometres, 0, 060, inches, the, use, of, too, much, choke, and, a, small, pattern, increases, the, difficulty, of, hitting, the, target, whereas, the, use, of, too, little, choke, produces, large, patterns, with, insufficient, pellet, density, to, reliably, break, targets, or, kill, game, cylinder, barrels, have, no, constriction, other, specialized, choke, tubes, exist, as, well, some, turkey, hunting, tubes, have, constrictions, greater, than, super, full, or, additional, features, like, porting, to, reduce, recoil, or, straight, rifling, that, is, designed, to, stop, any, spin, that, the, shot, column, might, acquire, when, traveling, down, the, barrel, these, tubes, are, often, extended, tubes, meaning, they, project, beyond, the, end, of, the, bore, giving, more, room, for, things, like, a, longer, conical, section, shot, spreaders, or, diffusion, chokes, work, opposite, of, normal, chokes, they, are, designed, to, spread, the, shot, more, than, a, cylinder, bore, generating, wider, patterns, for, very, short, range, use, a, number, of, recent, spreader, chokes, such, as, the, briley, diffusion, line, actually, use, rifling, in, the, choke, to, spin, the, shot, slightly, creating, a, wider, spread, the, briley, diffusion, uses, a, 1, in, 36, cm, twist, as, does, the, fabarm, lion, paradox, shotgun, oval, chokes, which, are, designed, to, provide, a, shot, pattern, wider, than, it, is, tall, are, sometimes, found, on, combat, shotguns, primarily, those, of, the, vietnam, war, era, they, were, available, for, aftermarket, addition, in, the, 1970s, from, companies, like, a, w, engineering, military, versions, of, the, ithaca, 37, with, duckbill, choke, were, used, in, limited, numbers, during, the, vietnam, war, by, us, navy, seals, it, arguably, increased, effectiveness, in, close, range, engagements, against, multiple, targets, two, major, disadvantages, plagued, the, system, one, was, erratic, patterning, the, second, was, that, the, shot, would, spread, too, quickly, providing, a, limited, effective, zone, offset, chokes, where, the, pattern, is, intentionally, slightly, off, of, center, are, used, to, change, the, point, of, impact, for, instance, an, offset, choke, can, be, used, to, make, a, double, barrelled, shotgun, with, poorly, aligned, barrels, hit, the, same, spot, with, both, barrels, shotguns, generally, have, longer, barrels, than, modern, rifles, unlike, rifles, however, the, long, shotgun, barrel, is, not, for, ballistic, purposes, shotgun, shells, use, small, powder, charges, in, large, diameter, bores, and, this, leads, to, very, low, muzzle, pressures, see, internal, ballistics, and, very, little, velocity, change, with, increasing, barrel, length, according, to, remington, modern, powder, in, a, shotgun, burns, completely, in, 25, 9, 8425, in, to, 36, 14, 173, in, cm, barrels, since, shotguns, are, generally, used, for, shooting, at, small, fast, moving, targets, it, is, important, to, lead, the, target, by, firing, slightly, ahead, of, the, target, so, that, when, the, shot, reaches, the, range, of, the, target, the, target, will, have, moved, into, the, pattern, shotguns, made, for, close, ranges, where, the, angular, speed, of, the, targets, is, great, such, as, skeet, or, upland, bird, hunting, tend, to, have, shorter, barrels, around, 24, to, 28, inches, 610, to, 710, millimetres, shotguns, for, longer, range, shooting, where, angular, speeds, are, small, trap, shooting, quail, pheasant, and, waterfowl, hunting, tend, to, have, longer, barrels, 28, to, 36, inches, 910, mm, the, longer, barrels, have, more, angular, momentum, and, will, therefore, swing, more, slowly, but, more, steadily, the, short, low, angular, momentum, barrels, swing, faster, but, are, less, steady, these, lengths, are, for, pump, or, semi, auto, shotguns, break, open, guns, have, shorter, overall, lengths, for, the, same, barrel, length, and, so, will, use, longer, barrels, the, break, open, design, saves, between, 7, 62, and, 15, 24, cm, 3, 00, and, 6, 00, in, in, overall, length, but, in, most, cases, pays, for, this, by, having, two, barrels, which, adds, weight, at, the, muzzle, barrels, for, shotguns, have, been, getting, longer, as, modern, steels, and, production, methods, make, the, barrels, stronger, and, lighter, a, longer, lighter, barrel, gives, the, same, inertia, for, less, overall, weight, shotguns, for, use, against, larger, slower, targets, generally, have, even, shorter, barrels, small, game, shotguns, for, hunting, game, like, rabbits, and, squirrels, or, shotguns, for, use, with, buckshot, for, deer, are, often, 56, to, 61, cm, 22, to, 24, in, shotguns, intended, for, all, round, hunting, are, a, compromise, but, a, 72, to, 74, cm, 28, to, 29, in, barrel, pump, action, 12, gauge, shotgun, with, a, modified, choke, can, serve, admirably, for, use, as, one, gun, intended, for, general, all, round, hunting, of, small, game, such, as, quails, rabbits, pheasants, doves, and, squirrels, in, semi, open, wooded, or, farmland, areas, in, many, parts, of, the, eastern, us, kentucky, indiana, tennessee, where, dense, brush, is, less, of, a, hindrance, and, the, ability, to, have, more, reach, is, important, for, hunting, in, dense, brush, shorter, barrel, lengths, are, often, preferred, when, hunting, the, same, types, of, game, shotguns, are, well, suited, for, the, use, of, caliber, conversion, sleeves, allowing, most, single, and, double, barrel, shotguns, to, fire, a, wide, range, of, ammunition, the, x, caliber, system, consists, of, eight, adapter, sleeves, that, allow, the, 12, gauge, models, to, fire, 380, acp, 9mm, luger, 38, special, 357, magnum, 40, s, w, 44, special, 44, magnum, 45, acp, 45, long, colt, 410, gauge, and, 20, gauge, ammunition, they, even, make, four, adapter, sleeves, that, allow, the, 20, gauge, models, to, fire, 9mm, luger, 38, special, 357, magnum, 45, acp, 45, long, colt, and, 410, gauge, ammunition, the, extremely, large, caliber, of, shotgun, shells, has, led, to, a, wide, variety, of, different, ammunition, shotshells, are, the, most, commonly, used, round, filled, with, lead, or, lead, substitute, pellets, of, this, general, class, the, most, common, subset, is, birdshot, which, uses, a, large, number, from, dozens, to, hundreds, of, small, pellets, meant, to, create, a, wide, kill, spread, to, hunt, birds, in, flight, shot, shells, are, described, by, the, size, and, number, of, the, pellets, within, and, numbered, in, reverse, order, the, smaller, the, number, the, bigger, the, pellet, size, similar, to, bore, gauge, size, nine, 9, shot, is, the, smallest, size, normally, used, for, hunting, and, is, used, on, small, upland, game, birds, such, as, dove, and, quail, larger, sizes, are, used, for, hunting, larger, upland, game, birds, and, waterfowl, buckshot, is, similar, to, but, larger, than, birdshot, and, was, originally, designed, for, hunting, larger, game, such, as, deer, hence, the, name, while, the, advent, of, new, more, accurate, slug, technologies, is, making, buckshot, less, attractive, for, hunting, it, is, still, the, most, common, choice, for, police, military, and, home, defense, uses, like, birdshot, buckshot, is, described, by, pellet, size, with, larger, numbers, indicating, smaller, shot, from, the, smallest, to, the, largest, buckshot, sizes, are, 4, called, number, four, 1, 0, one, aught, 00, double, aught, 000, triple, aught, and, 0000, four, aught, a, typical, round, for, defensive, use, would, be, a, 12, gauge, 2, 3, 4, inches, 7, 0, cm, length, 00, buck, shell, which, contains, 9, pellets, roughly, 8, 4, millimetres, 0, 33, in, in, diameter, each, comparable, to, a, 38, special, bullet, in, damage, potential, new, tactical, buckshot, rounds, designed, specifically, for, defensive, use, use, slightly, fewer, shot, at, lower, velocity, to, reduce, recoil, and, increase, controllability, of, the, shotgun, there, are, some, shotgun, rounds, designed, specifically, for, police, use, that, shoot, effectively, from, 50, yards, 46, m, with, a, 20, diameter, grouping, of, the, balls, slug, rounds, are, rounds, that, fire, a, single, solid, slug, they, are, used, for, hunting, large, game, and, in, certain, military, and, law, enforcement, applications, modern, slugs, are, moderately, accurate, especially, when, fired, from, special, rifled, slug, barrels, they, are, often, used, in, shotgun, only, hunting, zones, near, inhabited, areas, where, rifles, are, prohibited, due, to, their, greater, range, sabots, are, a, common, type, of, slug, round, while, some, slugs, are, exactly, that, a, 12, gauge, metal, projectile, in, a, cartridge, a, sabot, is, a, smaller, but, more, aerodynamic, projectile, surrounded, by, a, shoe, of, some, other, material, this, sabot, jacket, seals, the, barrel, increasing, pressure, and, acceleration, while, also, inducing, spin, on, the, projectile, in, a, rifled, barrel, once, the, projectile, clears, the, barrel, the, sabot, material, falls, away, leaving, an, unmarked, aerodynamic, bullet, to, continue, toward, the, target, the, advantages, over, a, traditional, slug, are, increased, shot, power, increased, bullet, velocity, due, to, the, lighter, mass, bullet, and, increased, accuracy, due, to, the, velocity, and, the, reduction, in, deformation, of, the, slug, itself, disadvantages, versus, a, traditional, slug, include, lower, muzzle, momentum, due, to, reduced, mass, reduced, damage, due, to, smaller, bullet, diameter, and, significantly, higher, per, unit, cost, the, unique, properties, of, the, shotgun, such, as, large, case, capacity, large, bore, and, the, lack, of, rifling, has, led, to, the, development, of, a, large, variety, of, specialty, shells, ranging, from, novelties, to, high, tech, military, rounds, brenneke, and, foster, type, slugs, have, the, same, basic, configuration, as, normal, slugs, but, have, increased, accuracy, the, hollowed, rear, of, the, foster, slug, improves, accuracy, by, placing, more, mass, in, the, front, of, the, projectile, therefore, inhibiting, the, tumble, that, normal, slugs, may, generate, the, brenneke, slug, takes, this, concept, a, bit, further, with, the, addition, of, a, wad, that, stays, connected, to, the, projectile, after, discharge, increasing, accuracy, both, slugs, are, commonly, found, with, fins, or, ribs, which, are, meant, to, allow, the, projectile, to, safely, squeeze, down, during, passage, through, chokes, but, they, do, not, increase, stability, in, flight, flechette, rounds, contain, aerodynamic, darts, typically, from, 8, to, 20, in, number, the, flechettes, provide, greatly, extended, range, due, to, their, aerodynamic, shape, and, improved, penetration, of, light, armor, american, troops, during, the, vietnam, war, packed, their, own, flechette, shotgun, rounds, called, beehive, rounds, after, the, similar, artillery, rounds, however, terminal, performance, was, poor, due, to, the, very, light, weight, of, the, flechettes, and, their, use, was, quickly, dropped, grenade, rounds, use, exploding, projectiles, to, increase, long, range, lethality, these, are, currently, experimental, but, the, british, frag, 12, which, comes, in, high, explosive, he, high, explosive, armor, piercing, heap, and, high, explosive, fragmenting, antipersonnel, hefa, forms, is, under, consideration, by, military, forces, flexible, baton, rounds, commonly, called, bean, bags, fire, a, fabric, bag, filled, with, birdshot, or, a, similar, loose, dense, substance, the, punch, effect, of, the, bag, is, useful, for, knocking, down, targets, the, rounds, are, used, by, police, to, subdue, violent, suspects, the, bean, bag, round, is, by, far, the, most, common, less, lethal, round, used, due, to, the, large, surface, area, of, these, rounds, they, lose, velocity, rapidly, and, must, be, used, at, fairly, short, ranges, to, be, effective, though, use, at, extremely, short, ranges, under, 3, m, 9, 8, ft, can, result, in, broken, bones, or, other, serious, or, lethal, injuries, the, rounds, can, also, fly, in, a, frisbee, like, fashion, and, cut, the, person, or, animal, being, fired, at, for, this, reason, these, types, of, rounds, are, referred, to, as, less, lethal, as, opposed, to, less, than, lethal, gas, shells, spray, a, cone, of, gas, for, several, meters, these, are, primarily, used, by, riot, police, they, normally, contain, pepper, gas, or, tear, gas, other, variations, launch, a, gas, grenade, like, projectile, rock, salt, shells, are, hand, loaded, with, coarse, rock, salt, crystals, replacing, the, standard, lead, or, steel, shot, rock, salt, shells, could, be, seen, as, the, forerunners, of, modern, less, lethal, rounds, in, the, united, states, rock, salt, shells, were, and, are, sometimes, still, used, by, rural, civilians, to, defend, their, property, the, brittle, salt, was, unlikely, to, cause, serious, injury, at, long, ranges, but, would, cause, painful, stinging, injuries, and, served, as, a, warning, british, gamekeepers, have, used, rock, salt, shells, to, deter, poachers, rather, than, get, into, a, physical, confrontation, they, stalk, the, poachers, making, themselves, known, by, a, loud, shout, of, run, just, before, firing, to, avoid, hitting, the, now, fleeing, subject, in, the, eyes, rubber, slugs, or, rubber, buckshot, are, similar, in, principle, to, the, bean, bag, rounds, composed, of, flexible, rubber, or, plastic, and, fired, at, low, velocities, these, rounds, are, probably, the, most, common, choice, for, riot, control, taser, international, announced, in, 2007, a, new, 12, gauge, extended, range, electronic, projectile, or, xrep, which, contains, a, small, electroshock, weapon, unit, in, a, carrier, that, can, be, fired, from, a, standard, 12, gauge, shotgun, the, xrep, projectile, is, fin, stabilized, and, travels, at, an, initial, velocity, of, 100, m, s, 300, ft, s, barbs, on, the, front, attach, the, electroshock, unit, to, the, target, with, a, tassel, deploying, from, the, rear, to, widen, the, circuit, a, twenty, second, burst, of, electrical, energy, is, delivered, to, the, target, this, product, was, expected, to, be, released, to, market, in, 2008, they, were, used, despite, still, being, subject, to, testing, in, breach, of, the, supplier, s, license, by, northumbria, police, in, their, standoff, with, raoul, moat, in, 2010, breaching, rounds, often, called, frangible, disintegrator, or, hatton, rounds, are, designed, to, destroy, door, locking, mechanisms, without, risking, lives, they, are, constructed, of, a, very, brittle, substance, that, transfers, most, of, the, energy, to, the, primary, target, but, then, fragment, into, much, smaller, pieces, or, dust, so, as, not, to, injure, unseen, targets, such, as, hostages, or, non, combatants, that, may, be, standing, behind, a, breached, door, bird, bombs, are, low, powered, rounds, that, fire, a, firecracker, that, is, fused, to, explode, a, short, time, after, firing, they, are, designed, to, scare, animals, such, as, birds, that, congregate, on, airport, runways, screechers, fire, a, pyrotechnic, whistle, that, emits, a, loud, whistling, sound, for, the, duration, of, its, flight, these, are, also, used, to, scare, animals, blank, shells, contain, only, a, small, amount, of, powder, and, no, actual, load, when, fired, the, blanks, provide, the, sound, and, flash, of, a, real, load, but, with, no, projectile, these, may, be, used, for, simulation, of, gunfire, scaring, wildlife, or, as, power, for, a, launching, device, such, as, the, mossberg, 50298, marine, line, launcher, stinger, is, a, type, of, shotgun, shell, which, contains, sixteen, 00, buck, balls, made, of, zytel, and, is, designed, as, a, non, lethal, ammunition, ideally, used, in, small, spaces, bolo, rounds, are, made, of, two, or, more, slugs, molded, onto, steel, wire, when, fired, the, slugs, separate, pulling, the, wire, taut, creating, a, flying, blade, which, could, theoretically, decapitate, people, and, animals, or, amputate, limbs, however, many, active, shotgun, users, consider, this, to, be, overstated, and, view, bolo, shells, as, being, less, effective, than, conventional, ammunition, bolo, shell, rounds, are, banned, in, many, locations, including, the, us, states, of, florida, and, illinois, due, to, concerns, about, their, potential, lethality, the, round, is, named, in, reference, to, bolas, which, use, two, or, more, weighted, balls, on, a, rope, to, trap, cattle, or, game, dragon, s, breath, usually, refers, to, a, zirconium, based, pyrotechnic, shotgun, round, when, fired, a, gout, of, flame, erupts, from, the, barrel, of, the, gun, up, to, 20, feet, or, 6, metres, the, visual, effect, it, produces, is, impressive, similar, to, that, of, a, short, ranged, flamethrower, however, it, has, few, tactical, uses, mainly, distraction, disorientation, flare, rounds, are, sometimes, carried, by, hunters, for, safety, and, rescue, purposes, they, are, available, in, low, and, high, altitude, versions, some, brands, claim, they, can, reach, a, height, of, up, to, 200, m, 660, ft, the, typical, use, of, a, shotgun, is, against, small, and, fast, moving, targets, often, while, in, the, air, the, spreading, of, the, shot, allows, the, user, to, point, the, shotgun, close, to, the, target, rather, than, having, to, aim, precisely, as, in, the, case, of, a, single, projectile, the, disadvantages, of, shot, are, limited, range, and, limited, penetration, of, the, shot, which, is, why, shotguns, are, used, at, short, ranges, and, typically, against, smaller, targets, larger, shot, sizes, up, to, the, extreme, case, of, the, single, projectile, slug, load, result, in, increased, penetration, but, at, the, expense, of, fewer, projectiles, and, lower, probability, of, hitting, the, target, aside, from, the, most, common, use, against, small, fast, moving, targets, the, shotgun, has, several, advantages, when, used, against, still, targets, first, it, has, enormous, stopping, power, at, short, range, more, than, nearly, all, handguns, and, many, rifles, though, many, believe, the, shotgun, is, a, great, firearm, for, inexperienced, shooters, the, truth, is, at, close, range, the, spread, of, shot, is, not, very, large, at, all, and, competency, in, aiming, is, still, required, a, typical, self, defense, load, of, buckshot, contains, 8, 27, large, lead, pellets, resulting, in, many, wound, tracks, in, the, target, also, unlike, a, fully, jacketed, rifle, bullet, each, pellet, of, shot, is, less, likely, to, penetrate, walls, and, hit, bystanders, though, in, the, case, of, traditional, 00, buck, overpenetration, of, soft, and, hard, targets, may, be, an, issue, it, is, favored, by, law, enforcement, for, its, low, penetration, and, high, stopping, power, on, the, other, hand, the, hit, potential, of, a, defensive, shotgun, is, often, overstated, the, typical, defensive, shot, is, taken, at, very, close, ranges, at, which, the, shot, charge, expands, no, more, than, a, few, centimeters, this, means, the, shotgun, must, still, be, aimed, at, the, target, with, some, care, balancing, this, is, the, fact, that, shot, spreads, further, upon, entering, the, target, and, the, multiple, wound, channels, are, far, more, likely, to, produce, a, disabling, wound, than, a, rifle, or, handgun, some, of, the, most, common, uses, of, shotguns, are, the, sports, of, skeet, shooting, trap, shooting, and, sporting, clays, these, involve, shooting, clay, discs, also, known, as, clay, pigeons, thrown, in, by, hand, and, by, machine, both, skeet, and, trap, competitions, are, featured, at, the, olympic, games, the, shotgun, is, popular, for, bird, hunting, called, game, shooting, in, the, united, kingdom, where, hunting, refers, to, hunting, mammals, with, a, pack, of, hounds, it, is, also, used, for, more, general, forms, of, hunting, especially, in, semi, populated, areas, where, the, range, of, rifle, bullets, may, pose, a, hazard, use, of, a, smoothbore, shotgun, with, a, rifled, slug, or, alternatively, a, rifled, barrel, shotgun, with, a, sabot, slug, improves, accuracy, to, 100, m, 110, yd, or, more, this, is, well, within, the, range, of, the, majority, of, kill, shots, by, experienced, hunters, using, shotguns, however, given, the, relatively, low, muzzle, velocity, of, slug, ammunition, typically, around, 500, m, s, about, 1600, feet, per, second, and, the, blunt, poorly, streamlined, shape, of, typical, slugs, which, cause, them, to, lose, velocity, very, rapidly, compared, to, rifle, bullets, a, hunter, must, pay, close, attention, to, the, ballistics, of, the, particular, ammunition, used, to, ensure, an, effective, and, humane, kill, shot, at, any, reasonable, range, shotgun, slugs, make, effective, lethal, wounds, due, to, their, tremendous, mass, reducing, the, length, of, time, that, an, animal, might, suffer, for, example, a, typical, 12, gauge, shotgun, slug, is, a, blunt, piece, of, metal, that, could, be, described, as, an, 18, mm, 729, inch, caliber, that, weighs, 28, grams, 432, grains, for, comparison, a, common, deer, hunting, rifle, round, is, a, 7, 62, mm, 308, inch, slug, weighing, 9, 7, grams, 150, grains, but, the, dynamics, of, the, rifle, cartridge, allow, for, a, different, type, of, wound, and, a, much, further, reach, shotguns, are, often, used, with, rifled, barrels, in, locations, where, it, is, not, lawful, to, hunt, with, a, rifle, typically, a, sabot, slug, is, used, in, these, barrels, for, maximum, accuracy, and, performance, shotguns, are, often, used, to, hunt, whitetail, deer, in, the, thick, brush, and, briers, of, the, southeastern, and, upper, midwestern, united, states, where, due, to, the, dense, cover, ranges, tend, to, be, close, 25m, or, less, sabot, slugs, are, essentially, very, large, hollow, point, bullets, and, are, streamlined, for, maximum, spin, and, accuracy, when, shot, through, a, rifled, barrel, they, have, greater, ranges, than, older, foster, and, brenneke, type, slugs, people, often, use, semiautomatic, or, pump, action, shotguns, for, hunting, waterfowl, to, small, game, in, many, countries, especially, the, united, states, and, canada, shotguns, are, widely, used, as, a, support, weapon, by, police, forces, one, of, the, rationales, for, issuing, shotguns, is, that, even, without, much, training, an, officer, will, probably, be, able, to, hit, targets, at, close, to, intermediate, range, due, to, the, spreading, effect, of, buckshot, this, is, largely, a, myth, as, the, spread, of, buckshot, at, 25, feet, averages, 8, inches, which, is, still, very, capable, of, missing, a, target, some, police, forces, are, replacing, shotguns, in, this, role, with, carbine, rifles, such, as, ar, 15s, shotguns, are, also, used, in, roadblock, situations, where, police, are, blocking, a, highway, to, search, cars, for, suspects, in, the, us, law, enforcement, agencies, often, use, riot, shotguns, especially, for, crowd, and, riot, control, where, they, may, be, loaded, with, less, lethal, rounds, such, as, rubber, bullets, or, bean, bags, shotguns, are, also, often, used, as, breaching, devices, to, defeat, locks, shotguns, are, common, weapons, in, military, use, particularly, for, special, purposes, shotguns, are, found, aboard, naval, vessels, for, shipboard, security, because, the, weapon, is, very, effective, at, close, range, as, a, way, of, repelling, enemy, boarding, parties, in, a, naval, setting, stainless, steel, shotguns, are, often, used, because, regular, steel, is, more, prone, to, corrosion, in, the, marine, environment, shotguns, are, also, used, by, military, police, units, u, s, marines, have, used, shotguns, since, their, inception, at, the, squad, level, often, in, the, hands, of, ncos, while, the, u, s, army, often, issued, them, to, a, squad, s, point, man, shotguns, were, modified, for, and, used, in, the, trench, warfare, of, world, war, i, in, the, jungle, combat, of, world, war, ii, and, the, vietnam, war, shotguns, were, also, used, in, the, iraq, war, being, popular, with, soldiers, in, urban, combat, environments, some, u, s, units, in, iraq, used, shotguns, with, special, frangible, breaching, rounds, to, blow, the, locks, or, hinges, off, doors, when, making, a, surprise, entry, into, a, dwelling, shotguns, are, a, popular, means, of, home, defense, for, many, of, the, same, reasons, they, are, preferred, for, close, quarters, tasks, in, law, enforcement, and, the, military, most, early, firearms, such, as, the, blunderbuss, arquebus, and, musket, had, large, diameter, smoothbore, barrels, and, could, fire, shot, as, well, as, solid, balls, a, firearm, intended, for, use, in, wing, shooting, of, birds, was, known, as, a, fowling, piece, the, 1728, cyclopaedia, defines, a, fowling, piece, as, fowling, piece, a, portable, fire, arm, for, the, shooting, of, birds, see, fire, arm, of, fowling, pieces, those, are, reputed, the, best, which, have, the, longest, barrel, vis, from, 5, 1, 2, foot, to, 6, with, an, indifferent, bore, under, harquebus, tho, for, different, occasions, they, shou, d, be, of, different, sorts, and, sizes, but, in, all, tis, essential, the, barrel, be, well, polish, d, and, smooth, within, and, the, bore, all, of, a, bigness, from, one, end, to, another, for, example, the, brown, bess, musket, in, service, with, the, british, army, from, 1722, to, 1838, had, a, 19, mm, 75, inch, smoothbore, barrel, roughly, the, same, as, a, 10, gauge, shotgun, and, was, 157, cm, 62, in, long, just, short, of, the, above, recommended, 168, cm, 5, 1, 2, feet, on, the, other, hand, records, from, the, plymouth, colony, show, a, maximum, length, of, 137, cm, 4, 1, 2, feet, for, fowling, pieces, shorter, than, the, typical, musket, shot, was, also, used, in, warfare, the, buck, and, ball, loading, combining, a, musket, ball, with, three, or, six, buckshot, was, used, throughout, the, history, of, the, smoothbore, musket, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, term, shotgun, was, in, 1776, in, kentucky, it, was, noted, as, part, of, the, frontier, language, of, the, west, by, james, fenimore, cooper, with, the, adoption, of, smaller, bores, and, rifled, barrels, the, shotgun, began, to, emerge, as, a, separate, entity, shotguns, have, long, been, the, preferred, method, for, sport, hunting, of, birds, and, the, largest, shotguns, the, punt, guns, were, used, for, commercial, hunting, the, double, barreled, shotgun, has, changed, little, since, the, development, of, the, boxlock, action, in, 1875, modern, innovations, such, as, interchangeable, chokes, and, subgauge, inserts, make, the, double, barreled, shotgun, the, shotgun, of, choice, in, skeet, trap, shooting, and, sporting, clays, as, well, as, with, many, hunters, as, wing, shooting, has, been, a, prestige, sport, specialty, gunsmiths, such, as, krieghoff, or, perazzi, have, produced, fancy, double, barrel, guns, for, wealthy, european, and, american, hunters, these, weapons, can, cost, us, 5, 000, or, more, some, elaborately, decorated, presentation, guns, have, sold, for, up, to, us, 100, 000, during, its, long, history, the, shotgun, has, been, favored, by, bird, hunters, guards, and, law, enforcement, officials, the, shotgun, has, fallen, in, and, out, of, favor, with, military, forces, several, times, in, its, long, history, shotguns, and, similar, weapons, are, simpler, than, long, range, rifles, and, were, developed, earlier, the, development, of, more, accurate, and, deadlier, long, range, rifles, minimized, the, usefulness, of, the, shotgun, on, the, open, battlefields, of, european, wars, but, armies, have, rediscovered, the, shotgun, for, specialty, uses, many, times, during, the, 19th, century, shotguns, were, mainly, employed, by, cavalry, units, both, sides, of, the, american, civil, war, employed, shotguns, u, s, cavalry, used, the, shotgun, extensively, during, the, indian, wars, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, mounted, units, favored, the, shotgun, for, its, moving, target, effectiveness, and, devastating, close, range, firepower, the, shotgun, was, also, favored, by, citizen, militias, and, similar, groups, with, the, exception, of, cavalry, units, the, shotgun, saw, less, and, less, use, throughout, the, 19th, century, on, the, battlefield, as, a, defense, weapon, it, remained, popular, with, guards, and, lawmen, however, and, the, shotgun, became, one, of, many, symbols, of, the, american, old, west, lawman, cody, lyons, killed, two, men, with, a, shotgun, his, friend, doc, holliday, s, only, confirmed, kill, was, with, a, shotgun, the, weapon, both, these, men, used, was, the, short, barreled, version, favored, by, private, strongbox, guards, on, stages, and, trains, these, guards, called, express, messengers, became, known, as, shotgun, messengers, since, they, rode, with, the, weapon, loaded, with, buckshot, for, defense, against, bandits, passenger, carriages, carrying, a, strongbox, usually, had, at, least, one, private, guard, armed, with, a, shotgun, riding, in, front, of, the, coach, next, to, the, driver, this, practice, has, survived, in, american, slang, the, term, riding, shotgun, is, used, for, the, passenger, who, sits, in, the, front, passenger, seat, the, shotgun, was, a, popular, weapon, for, personal, protection, in, the, american, old, west, requiring, less, skill, on, the, part, of, the, user, than, a, revolver, the, origins, of, the, hammerless, shotgun, are, european, but, otherwise, obscure, the, earliest, breechloading, shotguns, originated, in, france, and, belgium, in, the, early, 19th, century, see, also, the, history, of, the, pinfire, and, a, number, of, them, such, as, those, by, robert, and, chateauvillard, from, the, 1830s, and, 1840s, did, not, use, hammers, in, fact, during, these, decades, a, wide, variety, of, ingenious, weapons, including, rifles, adopted, what, is, now, often, known, as, a, needle, fire, method, of, igniting, the, charge, where, a, firing, pin, or, a, longer, sharper, needle, provided, the, necessary, impact, the, most, widely, used, british, hammerless, needle, fire, shotgun, was, the, unusual, hinged, chamber, fixed, barrel, breech, loader, by, joseph, needham, produced, from, the, 1850s, by, the, 1860s, hammerless, guns, were, increasingly, used, in, europe, both, in, war, and, sport, although, hammer, guns, were, still, very, much, in, the, majority, the, first, significant, encroachment, on, hammer, guns, was, a, hammerless, patent, which, could, be, used, with, a, conventional, side, lock, this, was, british, gunmaker, t, murcott, s, 1871, action, nicknamed, the, mousetrap, on, account, of, its, loud, snap, action, however, the, most, successful, hammerless, innovation, of, the, 1870s, was, anson, and, deeley, s, boxlock, patent, of, 1875, this, simple, but, ingenious, design, only, used, four, moving, parts, allowing, the, production, of, cheaper, and, reliable, shotguns, daniel, myron, lefever, is, credited, with, the, invention, of, the, american, hammerless, shotgun, working, for, barber, lefever, in, syracuse, new, york, he, introduced, his, first, hammerless, shotgun, in, 1878, this, gun, was, cocked, with, external, cocking, levers, on, the, side, of, the, breech, he, went, on, to, patent, the, first, truly, automatic, hammerless, shotgun, in, 1883, this, gun, automatically, cocked, itself, when, the, breech, was, closed, he, later, developed, the, mechanism, to, automatically, eject, the, shells, when, the, breech, was, opened, one, of, the, men, most, responsible, for, the, modern, development, of, the, shotgun, was, prolific, gun, designer, john, browning, while, working, for, winchester, firearms, browning, revolutionized, shotgun, design, in, 1887, browning, introduced, the, model, 1887, lever, action, repeating, shotgun, which, loaded, a, fresh, cartridge, from, its, internal, magazine, by, the, operation, of, the, action, lever, before, this, time, most, shotguns, were, the, break, open, type, this, development, was, greatly, overshadowed, by, two, further, innovations, he, introduced, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, 1893, browning, produced, the, model, 1893, pump, action, shotgun, introducing, the, now, familiar, pump, action, to, the, market, and, in, 1900, he, patented, the, browning, auto, 5, america, s, first, semi, automatic, shotgun, the, first, semi, automatic, shotgun, in, the, world, was, patented, in, 1891, 1893, by, the, clair, brothers, of, france, the, browning, auto, 5, remained, in, production, until, 1998, the, decline, in, military, use, of, shotguns, reversed, in, world, war, i, american, forces, under, general, pershing, employed, 12, gauge, pump, action, shotguns, when, they, were, deployed, to, the, western, front, in, 1917, these, shotguns, were, fitted, with, bayonets, and, a, heat, shield, so, the, barrel, could, be, gripped, while, the, bayonet, was, deployed, shotguns, fitted, in, this, fashion, became, known, as, trench, guns, by, the, united, states, army, those, without, such, modifications, were, known, as, riot, guns, after, world, war, i, the, united, states, military, began, referring, to, all, shotguns, as, riot, guns, due, to, the, cramped, conditions, of, trench, warfare, the, american, shotguns, were, extremely, effective, germany, even, filed, an, official, diplomatic, protest, against, their, use, alleging, they, violated, the, laws, of, warfare, the, judge, advocate, general, reviewed, the, protest, and, it, was, rejected, because, the, germans, protested, use, of, lead, shot, which, would, have, been, illegal, but, military, shot, was, plated, this, is, the, only, occasion, the, legality, of, the, shotgun, s, use, in, warfare, has, been, questioned, during, world, war, ii, the, shotgun, was, not, heavily, used, in, the, war, in, europe, by, official, military, forces, however, the, shotgun, was, a, favorite, weapon, of, allied, supported, partisans, such, as, the, french, resistance, by, contrast, in, the, pacific, theater, thick, jungles, and, heavily, fortified, positions, made, the, shotgun, a, favorite, weapon, of, the, united, states, marines, marines, tended, to, use, pump, shotguns, since, the, pump, action, was, less, likely, to, jam, in, the, humid, and, dirty, conditions, of, the, pacific, campaign, similarly, the, united, states, navy, used, pump, shotguns, to, guard, ships, when, in, port, in, chinese, harbors, e, g, shanghai, the, united, states, army, air, forces, also, used, pump, shotguns, to, guard, bombers, and, other, aircraft, against, saboteurs, when, parked, on, airbases, across, the, pacific, and, on, the, west, coast, of, the, united, states, pump, and, semi, automatic, shotguns, were, used, in, marksmanship, training, particularly, for, bomber, gunners, the, most, common, pump, shotguns, used, for, these, duties, were, the, 12, gauge, winchester, model, 97, and, model, 12, the, break, open, action, single, barrel, shotgun, was, used, by, the, british, home, guard, and, u, s, home, security, forces, notably, industrial, centers, such, as, the, gopher, state, steel, works, were, guarded, by, national, guard, soldiers, with, winchester, model, 37, 12, gauge, shotguns, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, shotgun, has, remained, a, specialty, weapon, for, modern, armies, it, has, been, deployed, for, specialized, tasks, where, its, strengths, were, put, to, particularly, good, use, it, was, used, to, defend, machine, gun, emplacements, during, the, korean, war, american, and, french, jungle, patrols, used, shotguns, during, the, vietnam, war, and, shotguns, saw, extensive, use, as, door, breaching, and, close, quarter, weapons, in, the, early, stages, of, the, iraq, war, and, saw, limited, use, in, tank, crews, many, modern, navies, make, extensive, use, of, shotguns, by, personnel, engaged, in, boarding, hostile, ships, as, any, shots, fired, will, almost, certainly, be, over, a, short, range, nonetheless, shotguns, are, far, less, common, in, military, use, than, rifles, carbines, submachine, guns, or, pistols, on, the, other, hand, the, shotgun, has, become, a, standard, in, law, enforcement, use, a, variety, of, specialty, less, lethal, or, non, lethal, ammunitions, such, as, tear, gas, shells, bean, bags, flares, explosive, sonic, stun, rounds, and, rubber, projectiles, all, packaged, into, 12, gauge, shotgun, shells, are, produced, specifically, for, the, law, enforcement, market, recently, taser, international, introduced, a, self, contained, electronic, weapon, which, is, fired, from, a, standard, 12, gauge, shotgun, the, shotgun, remains, a, standard, firearm, for, hunting, throughout, the, world, for, all, sorts, of, game, from, birds, and, small, game, to, large, game, such, as, deer, the, versatility, of, the, shotgun, as, a, hunting, weapon, has, steadily, increased, as, slug, rounds, and, more, advanced, rifled, barrels, have, given, shotguns, longer, range, and, higher, killing, power, the, shotgun, has, become, a, ubiquitous, firearm, in, the, hunting, community, globally, shotguns, are, generally, not, as, heavily, regulated, as, rifles, or, handguns, likely, because, they, lack, the, range, of, rifles, and, are, not, easily, concealable, as, handguns, are, thus, they, are, perceived, as, a, lesser, threat, by, legislative, authorities, the, one, exception, is, a, sawed, off, shotgun, especially, a, lupara, as, it, is, more, easily, concealed, than, a, normal, shotgun, within, australia, all, shotguns, manufactured, after, 1, january, 1901, are, considered, firearms, and, are, subject, to, registration, and, licensing, most, shotguns, including, break, action, bolt, action, and, lever, action, shotguns, are, classed, as, category, a, weapons, and, as, such, are, comparatively, easy, to, obtain, a, licence, for, given, a, legally, recognised, legitimate, reason, compare, to, the, british, requirement, for, good, reason, for, a, fac, such, as, sport, shooting, or, hunting, however, pump, action, and, semi, automatic, shotguns, are, classed, as, category, c, magazine, capacity, no, more, than, 5, rounds, or, category, d, magazine, capacity, more, than, 5, rounds, weapons, a, licence, for, this, type, of, firearm, is, practically, speaking, unavailable, to, the, average, citizen, due, to, the, difficulty, and, red, tape, of, acquiring, one, for, more, information, see, gun, politics, in, australia, canada, has, three, classifications, of, firearms, non, restricted, restricted, and,
