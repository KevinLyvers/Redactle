biotechnology, is, a, multidisciplinary, field, that, involves, the, integration, of, natural, sciences, and, engineering, sciences, in, order, to, achieve, the, application, of, organisms, and, parts, thereof, for, products, and, services, the, term, biotechnology, was, first, used, by, k, roly, ereky, in, 1919, to, refer, to, the, production, of, products, from, raw, materials, with, the, aid, of, living, organisms, the, core, principle, of, biotechnology, involves, harnessing, biological, systems, and, organisms, such, as, bacteria, yeast, and, plants, to, perform, specific, tasks, or, produce, valuable, substances, biotechnology, had, a, significant, impact, on, many, areas, of, society, from, medicine, to, agriculture, to, environmental, science, one, of, the, key, techniques, used, in, biotechnology, is, genetic, engineering, which, allows, scientists, to, modify, the, genetic, makeup, of, organisms, to, achieve, desired, outcomes, this, can, involve, inserting, genes, from, one, organism, into, another, and, consequently, create, new, traits, or, modifying, existing, ones, other, important, techniques, used, in, biotechnology, include, tissue, culture, which, allows, researchers, to, grow, cells, and, tissues, in, the, lab, for, research, and, medical, purposes, and, fermentation, which, is, used, to, produce, a, wide, range, of, products, such, as, beer, wine, and, cheese, the, applications, of, biotechnology, are, diverse, and, have, led, to, the, development, of, essential, products, like, life, saving, drugs, biofuels, genetically, modified, crops, and, innovative, materials, it, has, also, been, used, to, address, environmental, challenges, such, as, developing, biodegradable, plastics, and, using, microorganisms, to, clean, up, contaminated, sites, biotechnology, is, a, rapidly, evolving, field, with, significant, potential, to, address, pressing, global, challenges, and, improve, the, quality, of, life, for, people, around, the, world, however, despite, its, numerous, benefits, it, also, poses, ethical, and, societal, challenges, such, as, questions, around, genetic, modification, and, intellectual, property, rights, as, a, result, there, is, ongoing, debate, and, regulation, surrounding, the, use, and, application, of, biotechnology, in, various, industries, and, fields, the, concept, of, biotechnology, encompasses, a, wide, range, of, procedures, for, modifying, living, organisms, for, human, purposes, going, back, to, domestication, of, animals, cultivation, of, plants, and, improvements, to, these, through, breeding, programs, that, employ, artificial, selection, and, hybridization, modern, usage, also, includes, genetic, engineering, as, well, as, cell, and, tissue, culture, technologies, the, american, chemical, society, defines, biotechnology, as, the, application, of, biological, organisms, systems, or, processes, by, various, industries, to, learning, about, the, science, of, life, and, the, improvement, of, the, value, of, materials, and, organisms, such, as, pharmaceuticals, crops, and, livestock, as, per, the, european, federation, of, biotechnology, biotechnology, is, the, integration, of, natural, science, and, organisms, cells, parts, thereof, and, molecular, analogues, for, products, and, services, biotechnology, is, based, on, the, basic, biological, sciences, e, g, molecular, biology, biochemistry, cell, biology, embryology, genetics, microbiology, and, conversely, provides, methods, to, support, and, perform, basic, research, in, biology, biotechnology, is, the, research, and, development, in, the, laboratory, using, bioinformatics, for, exploration, extraction, exploitation, and, production, from, any, living, organisms, and, any, source, of, biomass, by, means, of, biochemical, engineering, where, high, value, added, products, could, be, planned, reproduced, by, biosynthesis, for, example, forecasted, formulated, developed, manufactured, and, marketed, for, the, purpose, of, sustainable, operations, for, the, return, from, bottomless, initial, investment, on, r, d, and, gaining, durable, patents, rights, for, exclusives, rights, for, sales, and, prior, to, this, to, receive, national, and, international, approval, from, the, results, on, animal, experiment, and, human, experiment, especially, on, the, pharmaceutical, branch, of, biotechnology, to, prevent, any, undetected, side, effects, or, safety, concerns, by, using, the, products, the, utilization, of, biological, processes, organisms, or, systems, to, produce, products, that, are, anticipated, to, improve, human, lives, is, termed, biotechnology, by, contrast, bioengineering, is, generally, thought, of, as, a, related, field, that, more, heavily, emphasizes, higher, systems, approaches, not, necessarily, the, altering, or, using, of, biological, materials, directly, for, interfacing, with, and, utilizing, living, things, bioengineering, is, the, application, of, the, principles, of, engineering, and, natural, sciences, to, tissues, cells, and, molecules, this, can, be, considered, as, the, use, of, knowledge, from, working, with, and, manipulating, biology, to, achieve, a, result, that, can, improve, functions, in, plants, and, animals, relatedly, biomedical, engineering, is, an, overlapping, field, that, often, draws, upon, and, applies, biotechnology, by, various, definitions, especially, in, certain, sub, fields, of, biomedical, or, chemical, engineering, such, as, tissue, engineering, biopharmaceutical, engineering, and, genetic, engineering, although, not, normally, what, first, comes, to, mind, many, forms, of, human, derived, agriculture, clearly, fit, the, broad, definition, of, utilizing, a, biotechnological, system, to, make, products, indeed, the, cultivation, of, plants, may, be, viewed, as, the, earliest, biotechnological, enterprise, agriculture, has, been, theorized, to, have, become, the, dominant, way, of, producing, food, since, the, neolithic, revolution, through, early, biotechnology, the, earliest, farmers, selected, and, bred, the, best, suited, crops, e, g, those, with, the, highest, yields, to, produce, enough, food, to, support, a, growing, population, as, crops, and, fields, became, increasingly, large, and, difficult, to, maintain, it, was, discovered, that, specific, organisms, and, their, by, products, could, effectively, fertilize, restore, nitrogen, and, control, pests, throughout, the, history, of, agriculture, farmers, have, inadvertently, altered, the, genetics, of, their, crops, through, introducing, them, to, new, environments, and, breeding, them, with, other, plants, one, of, the, first, forms, of, biotechnology, these, processes, also, were, included, in, early, fermentation, of, beer, these, processes, were, introduced, in, early, mesopotamia, egypt, china, and, india, and, still, use, the, same, basic, biological, methods, in, brewing, malted, grains, containing, enzymes, convert, starch, from, grains, into, sugar, and, then, adding, specific, yeasts, to, produce, beer, in, this, process, carbohydrates, in, the, grains, broke, down, into, alcohols, such, as, ethanol, later, other, cultures, produced, the, process, of, lactic, acid, fermentation, which, produced, other, preserved, foods, such, as, soy, sauce, fermentation, was, also, used, in, this, time, period, to, produce, leavened, bread, although, the, process, of, fermentation, was, not, fully, understood, until, louis, pasteur, s, work, in, 1857, it, is, still, the, first, use, of, biotechnology, to, convert, a, food, source, into, another, form, before, the, time, of, charles, darwin, s, work, and, life, animal, and, plant, scientists, had, already, used, selective, breeding, darwin, added, to, that, body, of, work, with, his, scientific, observations, about, the, ability, of, science, to, change, species, these, accounts, contributed, to, darwin, s, theory, of, natural, selection, for, thousands, of, years, humans, have, used, selective, breeding, to, improve, the, production, of, crops, and, livestock, to, use, them, for, food, in, selective, breeding, organisms, with, desirable, characteristics, are, mated, to, produce, offspring, with, the, same, characteristics, for, example, this, technique, was, used, with, corn, to, produce, the, largest, and, sweetest, crops, in, the, early, twentieth, century, scientists, gained, a, greater, understanding, of, microbiology, and, explored, ways, of, manufacturing, specific, products, in, 1917, chaim, weizmann, first, used, a, pure, microbiological, culture, in, an, industrial, process, that, of, manufacturing, corn, starch, using, clostridium, acetobutylicum, to, produce, acetone, which, the, united, kingdom, desperately, needed, to, manufacture, explosives, during, world, war, i, biotechnology, has, also, led, to, the, development, of, antibiotics, in, 1928, alexander, fleming, discovered, the, mold, penicillium, his, work, led, to, the, purification, of, the, antibiotic, compound, formed, by, the, mold, by, howard, florey, ernst, boris, chain, and, norman, heatley, to, form, what, we, today, know, as, penicillin, in, 1940, penicillin, became, available, for, medicinal, use, to, treat, bacterial, infections, in, humans, the, field, of, modern, biotechnology, is, generally, thought, of, as, having, been, born, in, 1971, when, paul, berg, s, stanford, experiments, in, gene, splicing, had, early, success, herbert, w, boyer, univ, calif, at, san, francisco, and, stanley, n, cohen, stanford, significantly, advanced, the, new, technology, in, 1972, by, transferring, genetic, material, into, a, bacterium, such, that, the, imported, material, would, be, reproduced, the, commercial, viability, of, a, biotechnology, industry, was, significantly, expanded, on, june, 16, 1980, when, the, united, states, supreme, court, ruled, that, a, genetically, modified, microorganism, could, be, patented, in, the, case, of, diamond, v, chakrabarty, indian, born, ananda, chakrabarty, working, for, general, electric, had, modified, a, bacterium, of, the, genus, pseudomonas, capable, of, breaking, down, crude, oil, which, he, proposed, to, use, in, treating, oil, spills, chakrabarty, s, work, did, not, involve, gene, manipulation, but, rather, the, transfer, of, entire, organelles, between, strains, of, the, pseudomonas, bacterium, the, mosfet, metal, oxide, semiconductor, field, effect, transistor, was, invented, by, mohamed, m, atalla, and, dawon, kahng, in, 1959, two, years, later, leland, c, clark, and, champ, lyons, invented, the, first, biosensor, in, 1962, biosensor, mosfets, were, later, developed, and, they, have, since, been, widely, used, to, measure, physical, chemical, biological, and, environmental, parameters, the, first, biofet, was, the, ion, sensitive, field, effect, transistor, isfet, invented, by, piet, bergveld, in, 1970, it, is, a, special, type, of, mosfet, where, the, metal, gate, is, replaced, by, an, ion, sensitive, membrane, electrolyte, solution, and, reference, electrode, the, isfet, is, widely, used, in, biomedical, applications, such, as, the, detection, of, dna, hybridization, biomarker, detection, from, blood, antibody, detection, glucose, measurement, ph, sensing, and, genetic, technology, by, the, mid, 1980s, other, biofets, had, been, developed, including, the, gas, sensor, fet, gasfet, pressure, sensor, fet, pressfet, chemical, field, effect, transistor, chemfet, reference, isfet, refet, enzyme, modified, fet, enfet, and, immunologically, modified, fet, imfet, by, the, early, 2000s, biofets, such, as, the, dna, field, effect, transistor, dnafet, gene, modified, fet, genfet, and, cell, potential, biofet, cpfet, had, been, developed, a, factor, influencing, the, biotechnology, sector, s, success, is, improved, intellectual, property, rights, legislation, and, enforcement, worldwide, as, well, as, strengthened, demand, for, medical, and, pharmaceutical, products, rising, demand, for, biofuels, is, expected, to, be, good, news, for, the, biotechnology, sector, with, the, department, of, energy, estimating, ethanol, usage, could, reduce, u, s, petroleum, derived, fuel, consumption, by, up, to, 30, by, 2030, the, biotechnology, sector, has, allowed, the, u, s, farming, industry, to, rapidly, increase, its, supply, of, corn, and, soybeans, the, main, inputs, into, biofuels, by, developing, genetically, modified, seeds, that, resist, pests, and, drought, by, increasing, farm, productivity, biotechnology, boosts, biofuel, production, main, article, outline, of, biotechnology, biotechnology, has, applications, in, four, major, industrial, areas, including, health, care, medical, crop, production, and, agriculture, non, food, industrial, uses, of, crops, and, other, products, e, g, biodegradable, plastics, vegetable, oil, biofuels, and, environmental, uses, for, example, one, application, of, biotechnology, is, the, directed, use, of, microorganisms, for, the, manufacture, of, organic, products, examples, include, beer, and, milk, products, another, example, is, using, naturally, present, bacteria, by, the, mining, industry, in, bioleaching, biotechnology, is, also, used, to, recycle, treat, waste, clean, up, sites, contaminated, by, industrial, activities, bioremediation, and, also, to, produce, biological, weapons, a, series, of, derived, terms, have, been, coined, to, identify, several, branches, of, biotechnology, for, example, in, medicine, modern, biotechnology, has, many, applications, in, areas, such, as, pharmaceutical, drug, discoveries, and, production, pharmacogenomics, and, genetic, testing, or, genetic, screening, in, 2021, nearly, 40, of, the, total, company, value, of, pharmaceutical, biotech, companies, worldwide, were, active, in, oncology, with, neurology, and, rare, diseases, being, the, other, two, big, applications, pharmacogenomics, a, combination, of, pharmacology, and, genomics, is, the, technology, that, analyses, how, genetic, makeup, affects, an, individual, s, response, to, drugs, researchers, in, the, field, investigate, the, influence, of, genetic, variation, on, drug, responses, in, patients, by, correlating, gene, expression, or, single, nucleotide, polymorphisms, with, a, drug, s, efficacy, or, toxicity, the, purpose, of, pharmacogenomics, is, to, develop, rational, means, to, optimize, drug, therapy, with, respect, to, the, patients, genotype, to, ensure, maximum, efficacy, with, minimal, adverse, effects, such, approaches, promise, the, advent, of, personalized, medicine, in, which, drugs, and, drug, combinations, are, optimized, for, each, individual, s, unique, genetic, makeup, biotechnology, has, contributed, to, the, discovery, and, manufacturing, of, traditional, small, molecule, pharmaceutical, drugs, as, well, as, drugs, that, are, the, product, of, biotechnology, biopharmaceutics, modern, biotechnology, can, be, used, to, manufacture, existing, medicines, relatively, easily, and, cheaply, the, first, genetically, engineered, products, were, medicines, designed, to, treat, human, diseases, to, cite, one, example, in, 1978, genentech, developed, synthetic, humanized, insulin, by, joining, its, gene, with, a, plasmid, vector, inserted, into, the, bacterium, escherichia, coli, insulin, widely, used, for, the, treatment, of, diabetes, was, previously, extracted, from, the, pancreas, of, abattoir, animals, cattle, or, pigs, the, genetically, engineered, bacteria, are, able, to, produce, large, quantities, of, synthetic, human, insulin, at, relatively, low, cost, biotechnology, has, also, enabled, emerging, therapeutics, like, gene, therapy, the, application, of, biotechnology, to, basic, science, for, example, through, the, human, genome, project, has, also, dramatically, improved, our, understanding, of, biology, and, as, our, scientific, knowledge, of, normal, and, disease, biology, has, increased, our, ability, to, develop, new, medicines, to, treat, previously, untreatable, diseases, has, increased, as, well, genetic, testing, allows, the, genetic, diagnosis, of, vulnerabilities, to, inherited, diseases, and, can, also, be, used, to, determine, a, child, s, parentage, genetic, mother, and, father, or, in, general, a, person, s, ancestry, in, addition, to, studying, chromosomes, to, the, level, of, individual, genes, genetic, testing, in, a, broader, sense, includes, biochemical, tests, for, the, possible, presence, of, genetic, diseases, or, mutant, forms, of, genes, associated, with, increased, risk, of, developing, genetic, disorders, genetic, testing, identifies, changes, in, chromosomes, genes, or, proteins, most, of, the, time, testing, is, used, to, find, changes, that, are, associated, with, inherited, disorders, the, results, of, a, genetic, test, can, confirm, or, rule, out, a, suspected, genetic, condition, or, help, determine, a, person, s, chance, of, developing, or, passing, on, a, genetic, disorder, as, of, 2011, several, hundred, genetic, tests, were, in, use, since, genetic, testing, may, open, up, ethical, or, psychological, problems, genetic, testing, is, often, accompanied, by, genetic, counseling, genetically, modified, crops, gm, crops, or, biotech, crops, are, plants, used, in, agriculture, the, dna, of, which, has, been, modified, with, genetic, engineering, techniques, in, most, cases, the, main, aim, is, to, introduce, a, new, trait, that, does, not, occur, naturally, in, the, species, biotechnology, firms, can, contribute, to, future, food, security, by, improving, the, nutrition, and, viability, of, urban, agriculture, furthermore, the, protection, of, intellectual, property, rights, encourages, private, sector, investment, in, agrobiotechnology, examples, in, food, crops, include, resistance, to, certain, pests, diseases, stressful, environmental, conditions, resistance, to, chemical, treatments, e, g, resistance, to, a, herbicide, reduction, of, spoilage, or, improving, the, nutrient, profile, of, the, crop, examples, in, non, food, crops, include, production, of, pharmaceutical, agents, biofuels, and, other, industrially, useful, goods, as, well, as, for, bioremediation, farmers, have, widely, adopted, gm, technology, between, 1996, and, 2011, the, total, surface, area, of, land, cultivated, with, gm, crops, had, increased, by, a, factor, of, 94, from, 17, 000, to, 1, 600, 000, square, kilometers, 4, 200, 000, to, 395, 400, 000, acres, 10, of, the, world, s, crop, lands, were, planted, with, gm, crops, in, 2010, as, of, 2011, 11, different, transgenic, crops, were, grown, commercially, on, 395, million, acres, 160, million, hectares, in, 29, countries, such, as, the, us, brazil, argentina, india, canada, china, paraguay, pakistan, south, africa, uruguay, bolivia, australia, philippines, myanmar, burkina, faso, mexico, and, spain, genetically, modified, foods, are, foods, produced, from, organisms, that, have, had, specific, changes, introduced, into, their, dna, with, the, methods, of, genetic, engineering, these, techniques, have, allowed, for, the, introduction, of, new, crop, traits, as, well, as, a, far, greater, control, over, a, food, s, genetic, structure, than, previously, afforded, by, methods, such, as, selective, breeding, and, mutation, breeding, commercial, sale, of, genetically, modified, foods, began, in, 1994, when, calgene, first, marketed, its, flavr, savr, delayed, ripening, tomato, to, date, most, genetic, modification, of, foods, have, primarily, focused, on, cash, crops, in, high, demand, by, farmers, such, as, soybean, corn, canola, and, cotton, seed, oil, these, have, been, engineered, for, resistance, to, pathogens, and, herbicides, and, better, nutrient, profiles, gm, livestock, have, also, been, experimentally, developed, in, november, 2013, none, were, available, on, the, market, but, in, 2015, the, fda, approved, the, first, gm, salmon, for, commercial, production, and, consumption, there, is, a, scientific, consensus, that, currently, available, food, derived, from, gm, crops, poses, no, greater, risk, to, human, health, than, conventional, food, but, that, each, gm, food, needs, to, be, tested, on, a, case, by, case, basis, before, introduction, nonetheless, members, of, the, public, are, much, less, likely, than, scientists, to, perceive, gm, foods, as, safe, the, legal, and, regulatory, status, of, gm, foods, varies, by, country, with, some, nations, banning, or, restricting, them, and, others, permitting, them, with, widely, differing, degrees, of, regulation, gm, crops, also, provide, a, number, of, ecological, benefits, if, not, used, in, excess, insect, resistant, crops, have, proven, to, lower, pesticide, usage, therefore, reducing, the, environmental, impact, of, pesticides, as, a, whole, however, opponents, have, objected, to, gm, crops, per, se, on, several, grounds, including, environmental, concerns, whether, food, produced, from, gm, crops, is, safe, whether, gm, crops, are, needed, to, address, the, world, s, food, needs, and, economic, concerns, raised, by, the, fact, these, organisms, are, subject, to, intellectual, property, law, biotechnology, has, several, applications, in, the, realm, of, food, security, crops, like, golden, rice, are, engineered, to, have, higher, nutritional, content, and, there, is, potential, for, food, products, with, longer, shelf, lives, though, not, a, form, of, agricultural, biotechnology, vaccines, can, help, prevent, diseases, found, in, animal, agriculture, additionally, agricultural, biotechnology, can, expedite, breeding, processes, in, order, to, yield, faster, results, and, provide, greater, quantities, of, food, transgenic, biofortification, in, cereals, has, been, considered, as, a, promising, method, to, combat, malnutrition, in, india, and, other, countries, industrial, biotechnology, known, mainly, in, europe, as, white, biotechnology, is, the, application, of, biotechnology, for, industrial, purposes, including, industrial, fermentation, it, includes, the, practice, of, using, cells, such, as, microorganisms, or, components, of, cells, like, enzymes, to, generate, industrially, useful, products, in, sectors, such, as, chemicals, food, and, feed, detergents, paper, and, pulp, textiles, and, biofuels, in, the, current, decades, significant, progress, has, been, done, in, creating, genetically, modified, organisms, gmos, that, enhance, the, diversity, of, applications, and, economical, viability, of, industrial, biotechnology, by, using, renewable, raw, materials, to, produce, a, variety, of, chemicals, and, fuels, industrial, biotechnology, is, actively, advancing, towards, lowering, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, moving, away, from, a, petrochemical, based, economy, synthetic, biology, is, considered, one, of, the, essential, cornerstones, in, industrial, biotechnology, due, to, its, financial, and, sustainable, contribution, to, the, manufacturing, sector, jointly, biotechnology, and, synthetic, biology, play, a, crucial, role, in, generating, cost, effective, products, with, nature, friendly, features, by, using, bio, based, production, instead, of, fossil, based, synthetic, biology, can, be, used, to, engineer, model, microorganisms, such, as, escherichia, coli, by, genome, editing, tools, to, enhance, their, ability, to, produce, bio, based, products, such, as, bioproduction, of, medicines, and, biofuels, for, instance, e, coli, and, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, in, a, consortium, could, be, used, as, industrial, microbes, to, produce, precursors, of, the, chemotherapeutic, agent, paclitaxel, by, applying, the, metabolic, engineering, in, a, co, culture, approach, to, exploit, the, benefits, from, the, two, microbes, another, example, of, synthetic, biology, applications, in, industrial, biotechnology, is, the, re, engineering, of, the, metabolic, pathways, of, e, coli, by, crispr, and, crispri, systems, toward, the, production, of, a, chemical, known, as, 1, 4, butanediol, which, is, used, in, fiber, manufacturing, in, order, to, produce, 1, 4, butanediol, the, authors, alter, the, metabolic, regulation, of, the, escherichia, coli, by, crispr, to, induce, point, mutation, in, the, glt, a, gene, knockout, of, the, sad, gene, and, knock, in, six, genes, cat, 1, suc, d, 4hbd, cat, 2, bld, and, bdh, whereas, crispri, system, used, to, knockdown, the, three, competing, genes, gab, d, ybg, c, and, tes, b, that, affect, the, biosynthesis, pathway, of, 1, 4, butanediol, consequently, the, yield, of, 1, 4, butanediol, significantly, increased, from, 0, 9, to, 1, 8, g, l, environmental, biotechnology, includes, various, disciplines, that, play, an, essential, role, in, reducing, environmental, waste, and, providing, environmentally, safe, processes, such, as, biofiltration, and, biodegradation, the, environment, can, be, affected, by, biotechnologies, both, positively, and, adversely, vallero, and, others, have, argued, that, the, difference, between, beneficial, biotechnology, e, g, bioremediation, is, to, clean, up, an, oil, spill, or, hazard, chemical, leak, versus, the, adverse, effects, stemming, from, biotechnological, enterprises, e, g, flow, of, genetic, material, from, transgenic, organisms, into, wild, strains, can, be, seen, as, applications, and, implications, respectively, cleaning, up, environmental, wastes, is, an, example, of, an, application, of, environmental, biotechnology, whereas, loss, of, biodiversity, or, loss, of, containment, of, a, harmful, microbe, are, examples, of, environmental, implications, of, biotechnology, many, cities, have, installed, citytrees, which, use, biotechnology, to, filter, pollutants, from, urban, atmospheres, the, regulation, of, genetic, engineering, concerns, approaches, taken, by, governments, to, assess, and, manage, the, risks, associated, with, the, use, of, genetic, engineering, technology, and, the, development, and, release, of, genetically, modified, organisms, gmo, including, genetically, modified, crops, and, genetically, modified, fish, there, are, differences, in, the, regulation, of, gmos, between, countries, with, some, of, the, most, marked, differences, occurring, between, the, us, and, europe, regulation, varies, in, a, given, country, depending, on, the, intended, use, of, the, products, of, the, genetic, engineering, for, example, a, crop, not, intended, for, food, use, is, generally, not, reviewed, by, authorities, responsible, for, food, safety, the, european, union, differentiates, between, approval, for, cultivation, within, the, eu, and, approval, for, import, and, processing, while, only, a, few, gmos, have, been, approved, for, cultivation, in, the, eu, a, number, of, gmos, have, been, approved, for, import, and, processing, the, cultivation, of, gmos, has, triggered, a, debate, about, the, coexistence, of, gm, and, non, gm, crops, depending, on, the, coexistence, regulations, incentives, for, the, cultivation, of, gm, crops, differ, the, euginius, european, gmo, initiative, for, a, unified, database, system, database, is, intended, to, help, companies, interested, private, users, and, competent, authorities, to, find, precise, information, on, the, presence, detection, and, identification, of, gmos, used, in, the, european, union, the, information, is, provided, in, english, in, 1988, after, prompting, from, the, united, states, congress, the, national, institute, of, general, medical, sciences, national, institutes, of, health, nigms, instituted, a, funding, mechanism, for, biotechnology, training, universities, nationwide, compete, for, these, funds, to, establish, biotechnology, training, programs, btps, each, successful, application, is, generally, funded, for, five, years, then, must, be, competitively, renewed, graduate, students, in, turn, compete, for, acceptance, into, a, btp, if, accepted, then, stipend, tuition, and, health, insurance,

october, 9, 2022, in, spite, of, this, the, number, of, studies, specifically, focused, on, safety, assessment, of, gm, plants, is, still, limited, however, it, is, important, to, remark, that, for, the, first, time, a, certain, equilibrium, in, the, number, of, research, groups, suggesting, on, the, basis, of, their, studies, that, a, number, of, varieties, of, gm, products, mainly, maize, and, soybeans, are, as, safe, and, nutritious, as, the, respective, conventional, non, gm, plant, and, those, raising, still, serious, concerns, was, observed, moreover, it, is, worth, mentioning, that, most, of, the, studies, demonstrating, that, gm, foods, are, as, nutritional, and, safe, as, those, obtained, by, conventional, breeding, have, been, performed, by, biotechnology, companies, or, associates, which, are, also, responsible, of, commercializing, these, gm, plants, anyhow, this, represents, a, notable, advance, in, comparison, with, the, lack, of, studies, published, in, recent, years, in, scientific, journals, by, those, companies, krimsky, sheldon, 2015, an, illusory, consensus, behind, gmo, health, assessment, science, technology, human, values, 40, 6, 883, 914, doi, 10,

effects, of, gmos, my, investigation, into, the, scientific, literature, tells, another, story, and, contrast, panchin, alexander, y, tuzhikov, alexander, i, january, 14, 2016, published, gmo,

pmid, 26767435, s2cid, 11786594, here, we, show, that, a, number, of, articles, some, of, which, have, strongly, and, negatively, influenced, the, public, opinion, on, gm, crops, and, even, provoked, political, actions, such, as, gmo, embargo, share, common, flaws, in, the, statistical, evaluation, of, the, data, having, accounted, for, these, flaws, we, conclude, that, the, data, presented, in, these, articles, does, not, provide, any, substantial, evidence, of, gmo, harm, the, presented, articles, suggesting, possible, harm, of, gmos, received, high, public, attention, however, despite, their, claims, they, actually, weaken, the, evidence, for, the, harm, and, lack, of, substantial, equivalency, of, studied, gmos, we, emphasize, that, with, over, 1783, published, articles, on, gmos, over, the, last, 10, years, it, is, expected, that, some, of, them, should, have, reported, undesired, differences, between, gmos, and, conventional, crops, even, if, no, such, differences, exist, in, reality, and
