a, calendar, is, a, system, of, organizing, days, this, is, done, by, giving, names, to, periods, of, time, typically, days, weeks, months, and, years, a, date, is, the, designation, of, a, single, and, specific, day, within, such, a, system, a, calendar, is, also, a, physical, record, often, paper, of, such, a, system, a, calendar, can, also, mean, a, list, of, planned, events, such, as, a, court, calendar, or, a, partly, or, fully, chronological, list, of, documents, such, as, a, calendar, of, wills, periods, in, a, calendar, such, as, years, and, months, are, usually, though, not, necessarily, synchronized, with, the, cycle, of, the, sun, or, the, moon, the, most, common, type, of, pre, modern, calendar, was, the, lunisolar, calendar, a, lunar, calendar, that, occasionally, adds, one, intercalary, month, to, remain, synchronized, with, the, solar, year, over, the, long, term, the, term, calendar, is, taken, from, kalendae, the, term, for, the, first, day, of, the, month, in, the, roman, calendar, related, to, the, verb, calare, to, call, out, referring, to, the, calling, of, the, new, moon, when, it, was, first, seen, latin, calendarium, meant, account, book, register, as, accounts, were, settled, and, debts, were, collected, on, the, calends, of, each, month, the, latin, term, was, adopted, in, old, french, as, calendier, and, from, there, in, middle, english, as, calender, by, the, 13th, century, the, spelling, calendar, is, early, modern, the, course, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, are, the, most, salient, regularly, recurring, natural, events, useful, for, timekeeping, and, in, pre, modern, societies, around, the, world, lunation, and, the, year, were, most, commonly, used, as, time, units, nevertheless, the, roman, calendar, contained, remnants, of, a, very, ancient, pre, etruscan, 10, month, solar, year, the, first, recorded, physical, calendars, dependent, on, the, development, of, writing, in, the, ancient, near, east, are, the, bronze, age, egyptian, and, sumerian, calendars, during, the, vedic, period, india, developed, a, sophisticated, timekeeping, methodology, and, calendars, for, vedic, rituals, according, to, yukio, ohashi, the, vedanga, calendar, in, ancient, india, was, based, on, astronomical, studies, during, the, vedic, period, and, was, not, derived, from, other, cultures, a, large, number, of, calendar, systems, in, the, ancient, near, east, were, based, on, the, babylonian, calendar, dating, from, the, iron, age, among, them, the, calendar, system, of, the, persian, empire, which, in, turn, gave, rise, to, the, zoroastrian, calendar, and, the, hebrew, calendar, a, great, number, of, hellenic, calendars, were, developed, in, classical, greece, and, during, the, hellenistic, period, they, gave, rise, to, the, ancient, roman, calendar, and, to, various, hindu, calendars, calendars, in, antiquity, were, lunisolar, depending, on, the, introduction, of, intercalary, months, to, align, the, solar, and, the, lunar, years, this, was, mostly, based, on, observation, but, there, may, have, been, early, attempts, to, model, the, pattern, of, intercalation, algorithmically, as, evidenced, in, the, fragmentary, 2nd, century, coligny, calendar, the, roman, calendar, was, reformed, by, julius, caesar, in, 46, bc, his, julian, calendar, was, no, longer, dependent, on, the, observation, of, the, new, moon, but, followed, an, algorithm, of, introducing, a, leap, day, every, four, years, this, created, a, dissociation, of, the, calendar, month, from, lunation, the, gregorian, calendar, introduced, in, 1582, corrected, most, of, the, remaining, difference, between, the, julian, calendar, and, the, solar, year, the, islamic, calendar, is, based, on, the, prohibition, of, intercalation, nasi, by, muhammad, in, islamic, tradition, dated, to, a, sermon, given, on, 9, dhu, al, hijjah, ah, 10, julian, date, 6, march, 632, this, resulted, in, an, observation, based, lunar, calendar, that, shifts, relative, to, the, seasons, of, the, solar, year, there, have, been, several, modern, proposals, for, reform, of, the, modern, calendar, such, as, the, world, calendar, the, international, fixed, calendar, the, holocene, calendar, and, the, hanke, henry, permanent, calendar, such, ideas, are, mooted, from, time, to, time, but, have, failed, to, gain, traction, because, of, the, loss, of, continuity, and, the, massive, upheaval, that, implementing, them, would, involve, as, well, as, their, effect, on, cycles, of, religious, activity, a, full, calendar, system, has, a, different, calendar, date, for, every, day, thus, the, week, cycle, is, by, itself, not, a, full, calendar, system, neither, is, a, system, to, name, the, days, within, a, year, without, a, system, for, identifying, the, years, the, simplest, calendar, system, just, counts, time, periods, from, a, reference, date, this, applies, for, the, julian, day, or, unix, time, virtually, the, only, possible, variation, is, using, a, different, reference, date, in, particular, one, less, distant, in, the, past, to, make, the, numbers, smaller, computations, in, these, systems, are, just, a, matter, of, addition, and, subtraction, other, calendars, have, one, or, multiple, larger, units, of, time, calendars, that, contain, one, level, of, cycles, calendars, with, two, levels, of, cycles, cycles, can, be, synchronized, with, periodic, phenomena, very, commonly, a, calendar, includes, more, than, one, type, of, cycle, or, has, both, cyclic, and, non, cyclic, elements, most, calendars, incorporate, more, complex, cycles, for, example, the, vast, majority, of, them, track, years, months, weeks, and, days, the, seven, day, week, is, practically, universal, though, its, use, varies, it, has, run, uninterrupted, for, millennia, solar, calendars, assign, a, date, to, each, solar, day, a, day, may, consist, of, the, period, between, sunrise, and, sunset, with, a, following, period, of, night, or, it, may, be, a, period, between, successive, events, such, as, two, sunsets, the, length, of, the, interval, between, two, such, successive, events, may, be, allowed, to, vary, slightly, during, the, year, or, it, may, be, averaged, into, a, mean, solar, day, other, types, of, calendar, may, also, use, a, solar, day, the, egyptians, appear, to, have, been, the, first, to, develop, a, solar, calendar, using, as, a, fixed, point, the, annual, sunrise, reappearance, of, the, dog, star, sirius, or, sothis, in, the, eastern, sky, which, coincided, with, the, annual, flooding, of, the, nile, river, they, built, a, calendar, with, 365, days, divided, into, 12, months, of, 30, days, each, with, 5, extra, days, at, the, end, of, the, year, however, they, did, not, include, the, extra, bit, of, time, in, each, year, and, this, caused, their, calendar, to, slowly, become, inaccurate, not, all, calendars, use, the, solar, year, as, a, unit, a, lunar, calendar, is, one, in, which, days, are, numbered, within, each, lunar, phase, cycle, because, the, length, of, the, lunar, month, is, not, an, even, fraction, of, the, length, of, the, tropical, year, a, purely, lunar, calendar, quickly, drifts, against, the, seasons, which, do, not, vary, much, near, the, equator, it, does, however, stay, constant, with, respect, to, other, phenomena, notably, tides, an, example, is, the, islamic, calendar, alexander, marshack, in, a, controversial, reading, believed, that, marks, on, a, bone, baton, c, 25, 000, bc, represented, a, lunar, calendar, other, marked, bones, may, also, represent, lunar, calendars, similarly, michael, rappenglueck, believes, that, marks, on, a, 15, 000, year, old, cave, painting, represent, a, lunar, calendar, a, lunisolar, calendar, is, a, lunar, calendar, that, compensates, by, adding, an, extra, month, as, needed, to, realign, the, months, with, the, seasons, prominent, examples, of, lunisolar, calendar, are, hindu, calendar, and, buddhist, calendar, that, are, popular, in, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, another, example, is, the, hebrew, calendar, which, uses, a, 19, year, cycle, nearly, all, calendar, systems, group, consecutive, days, into, months, and, also, into, years, in, a, solar, calendar, a, year, approximates, earth, s, tropical, year, that, is, the, time, it, takes, for, a, complete, cycle, of, seasons, traditionally, used, to, facilitate, the, planning, of, agricultural, activities, in, a, lunar, calendar, the, month, approximates, the, cycle, of, the, moon, phase, consecutive, days, may, be, grouped, into, other, periods, such, as, the, week, because, the, number, of, days, in, the, tropical, year, is, not, a, whole, number, a, solar, calendar, must, have, a, different, number, of, days, in, different, years, this, may, be, handled, for, example, by, adding, an, extra, day, in, leap, years, the, same, applies, to, months, in, a, lunar, calendar, and, also, the, number, of, months, in, a, year, in, a, lunisolar, calendar, this, is, generally, known, as, intercalation, even, if, a, calendar, is, solar, but, not, lunar, the, year, cannot, be, divided, entirely, into, months, that, never, vary, in, length, cultures, may, define, other, units, of, time, such, as, the, week, for, the, purpose, of, scheduling, regular, activities, that, do, not, easily, coincide, with, months, or, years, many, cultures, use, different, baselines, for, their, calendars, starting, years, historically, several, countries, have, based, their, calendars, on, regnal, years, a, calendar, based, on, the, reign, of, their, current, sovereign, for, example, the, year, 2006, in, japan, is, year, 18, heisei, with, heisei, being, the, era, name, of, emperor, akihito, an, astronomical, calendar, is, based, on, ongoing, observation, examples, are, the, religious, islamic, calendar, and, the, old, religious, jewish, calendar, in, the, time, of, the, second, temple, such, a, calendar, is, also, referred, to, as, an, observation, based, calendar, the, advantage, of, such, a, calendar, is, that, it, is, perfectly, and, perpetually, accurate, the, disadvantage, is, that, working, out, when, a, particular, date, would, occur, is, difficult, an, arithmetic, calendar, is, one, that, is, based, on, a, strict, set, of, rules, an, example, is, the, current, jewish, calendar, such, a, calendar, is, also, referred, to, as, a, rule, based, calendar, the, advantage, of, such, a, calendar, is, the, ease, of, calculating, when, a, particular, date, occurs, the, disadvantage, is, imperfect, accuracy, furthermore, even, if, the, calendar, is, very, accurate, its, accuracy, diminishes, slowly, over, time, owing, to, changes, in, earth, s, rotation, this, limits, the, lifetime, of, an, accurate, arithmetic, calendar, to, a, few, thousand, years, after, then, the, rules, would, need, to, be, modified, from, observations, made, since, the, invention, of, the, calendar, the, early, roman, calendar, created, during, the, reign, of, romulus, lumped, the, 61, days, of, the, winter, period, them, together, as, simply, winter, over, time, this, period, became, january, and, february, through, further, changes, over, time, including, the, creation, of, the, julian, calendar, this, calendar, became, the, modern, gregorian, calendar, introduced, in, the, 1570s, the, primary, practical, use, of, a, calendar, is, to, identify, days, to, be, informed, about, or, to, agree, on, a, future, event, and, to, record, an, event, that, has, happened, days, may, be, significant, for, agricultural, civil, religious, or, social, reasons, for, example, a, calendar, provides, a, way, to, determine, when, to, start, planting, or, harvesting, which, days, are, religious, or, civil, holidays, which, days, mark, the, beginning, and, end, of, business, accounting, periods, and, which, days, have, legal, significance, such, as, the, day, taxes, are, due, or, a, contract, expires, also, a, calendar, may, by, identifying, a, day, provide, other, useful, information, about, the, day, such, as, its, season, calendars, are, also, used, as, part, of, a, complete, timekeeping, system, date, and, time, of, day, together, specify, a, moment, in, time, in, the, modern, world, timekeepers, can, show, time, date, and, weekday, some, may, also, show, the, lunar, phase, the, gregorian, calendar, is, the, de, facto, international, standard, and, is, used, almost, everywhere, in, the, world, for, civil, purposes, the, widely, used, solar, aspect, is, a, cycle, of, leap, days, in, a, 400, year, cycle, designed, to, keep, the, duration, of, the, year, aligned, with, the, solar, year, there, is, a, lunar, aspect, which, approximates, the, position, of, the, moon, during, the, year, and, is, used, in, the, calculation, of, the, date, of, easter, each, gregorian, year, has, either, 365, or, 366, days, the, leap, day, being, inserted, as, 29, february, amounting, to, an, average, gregorian, year, of, 365, 2425, days, compared, to, a, solar, year, of, 365, 2422, days, the, gregorian, calendar, was, introduced, in, 1582, as, a, refinement, to, the, julian, calendar, that, had, been, in, use, throughout, the, european, middle, ages, amounting, to, a, 0, 002, correction, in, the, length, of, the, year, during, the, early, modern, period, its, adoption, was, mostly, limited, to, roman, catholic, nations, but, by, the, 19th, century, it, had, become, widely, adopted, for, the, sake, of, convenience, in, international, trade, the, last, european, country, to, adopt, it, was, greece, in, 1923, the, calendar, epoch, used, by, the, gregorian, calendar, is, inherited, from, the, medieval, convention, established, by, dionysius, exiguus, and, associated, with, the, julian, calendar, the, year, number, is, variously, given, as, ad, for, anno, domini, or, ce, for, common, era, or, christian, era, the, most, important, use, of, pre, modern, calendars, is, keeping, track, of, the, liturgical, year, and, the, observation, of, religious, feast, days, while, the, gregorian, calendar, is, itself, historically, motivated, to, the, calculation, of, the, easter, date, it, is, now, in, worldwide, secular, use, as, the, de, facto, standard, alongside, the, use, of, the, gregorian, calendar, for, secular, matters, there, remain, several, calendars, in, use, for, religious, purposes, western, christian, liturgical, calendars, are, based, on, the, cycle, of, the, roman, rite, of, the, catholic, church, and, generally, include, the, liturgical, seasons, of, advent, christmas, ordinary, time, time, after, epiphany, lent, easter, and, ordinary, time, time, after, pentecost, some, christian, calendars, do, not, include, ordinary, time, and, every, day, falls, into, a, denominated, season, the, eastern, orthodox, church, employs, the, use, of, 2, liturgical, calendars, the, julian, calendar, often, called, the, old, calendar, and, the, revised, julian, calendar, often, called, the, new, calendar, the, revised, julian, calendar, is, nearly, the, same, as, the, gregorian, calendar, with, the, addition, that, years, divisible, by, 100, are, not, leap, years, except, that, years, with, remainders, of, 200, or, 600, when, divided, by, 900, remain, leap, years, e, g, 2000, and, 2400, as, in, the, gregorian, calendar, the, islamic, calendar, or, hijri, calendar, is, a, lunar, calendar, consisting, of, 12, lunar, months, in, a, year, of, 354, or, 355, days, it, is, used, to, date, events, in, most, of,

festivals, its, epoch, is, the, hijra, corresponding, to, ad, 622, with, an, annual, drift, of, 11, or, 12, days, the, seasonal, relation, is, repeated, approximately, every, 33, islamic, years,
