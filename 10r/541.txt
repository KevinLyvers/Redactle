artillery, are, ranged, weapons, that, launch, munitions, far, beyond, the, range, and, power, of, infantry, firearms, early, artillery, development, focused, on, the, ability, to, breach, defensive, walls, and, fortifications, during, sieges, and, led, to, heavy, fairly, immobile, siege, engines, as, technology, improved, lighter, more, mobile, field, artillery, cannons, developed, for, battlefield, use, this, development, continues, today, modern, self, propelled, artillery, vehicles, are, highly, mobile, weapons, of, great, versatility, generally, providing, the, largest, share, of, an, army, s, total, firepower, originally, the, word, artillery, referred, to, any, group, of, soldiers, primarily, armed, with, some, form, of, manufactured, weapon, or, armour, since, the, introduction, of, gunpowder, and, cannon, artillery, has, largely, meant, cannon, and, in, contemporary, usage, usually, refers, to, shell, firing, guns, howitzers, and, mortars, collectively, called, barrel, artillery, cannon, artillery, or, gun, artillery, and, rocket, artillery, in, common, speech, the, word, artillery, is, often, used, to, refer, to, individual, devices, along, with, their, accessories, and, fittings, although, these, assemblages, are, more, properly, called, equipment, however, there, is, no, generally, recognized, generic, term, for, a, gun, howitzer, mortar, and, so, forth, the, united, states, uses, artillery, piece, but, most, english, speaking, armies, use, gun, and, mortar, the, projectiles, fired, are, typically, either, shot, if, solid, or, shell, if, not, solid, historically, variants, of, solid, shot, including, canister, chain, shot, and, grapeshot, were, also, used, shell, is, a, widely, used, generic, term, for, a, projectile, which, is, a, component, of, munitions, by, association, artillery, may, also, refer, to, the, arm, of, service, that, customarily, operates, such, engines, in, some, armies, the, artillery, arm, has, operated, field, coastal, anti, aircraft, and, anti, tank, artillery, in, others, these, have, been, separate, arms, and, with, some, nations, coastal, has, been, a, naval, or, marine, responsibility, in, the, 20th, century, target, acquisition, devices, such, as, radar, and, techniques, such, as, sound, ranging, and, flash, spotting, emerged, primarily, for, artillery, these, are, usually, utilized, by, one, or, more, of, the, artillery, arms, the, widespread, adoption, of, indirect, fire, in, the, early, 20th, century, introduced, the, need, for, specialist, data, for, field, artillery, notably, survey, and, meteorological, and, in, some, armies, provision, of, these, are, the, responsibility, of, the, artillery, arm, the, majority, of, combat, deaths, in, the, napoleonic, wars, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, were, caused, by, artillery, in, 1944, joseph, stalin, said, in, a, speech, that, artillery, was, the, god, of, war, although, not, called, by, that, name, siege, engines, performing, the, role, recognizable, as, artillery, have, been, employed, in, warfare, since, antiquity, the, first, known, catapult, was, developed, in, syracuse, in, 399, bc, until, the, introduction, of, gunpowder, into, western, warfare, artillery, was, dependent, upon, mechanical, energy, which, not, only, severely, limited, the, kinetic, energy, of, the, projectiles, it, also, required, the, construction, of, very, large, engines, to, accumulate, sufficient, energy, a, 1st, century, bc, roman, catapult, launching, 6, 55, kg, 14, 4, lb, stones, achieved, a, kinetic, energy, of, 16, kilojoules, compared, to, a, mid, 19th, century, 12, pounder, gun, which, fired, a, 4, 1, kg, 9, 0, lb, round, with, a, kinetic, energy, of, 240, kilojoules, or, a, 20th, century, us, battleship, that, fired, a, 1, 225, kg, 2, 701, lb, projectile, from, its, main, battery, with, an, energy, level, surpassing, 350, megajoules, from, the, middle, ages, through, most, of, the, modern, era, artillery, pieces, on, land, were, moved, by, horse, drawn, gun, carriages, in, the, contemporary, era, artillery, pieces, and, their, crew, relied, on, wheeled, or, tracked, vehicles, as, transportation, these, land, versions, of, artillery, were, dwarfed, by, railway, guns, the, largest, of, these, large, calibre, guns, ever, conceived, project, babylon, of, the, supergun, affair, was, theoretically, capable, of, putting, a, satellite, into, orbit, artillery, used, by, naval, forces, has, also, changed, significantly, with, missiles, generally, replacing, guns, in, surface, warfare, over, the, course, of, military, history, projectiles, were, manufactured, from, a, wide, variety, of, materials, into, a, wide, variety, of, shapes, using, many, different, methods, in, which, to, target, structural, defensive, works, and, inflict, enemy, casualties, the, engineering, applications, for, ordnance, delivery, have, likewise, changed, significantly, over, time, encompassing, some, of, the, most, complex, and, advanced, technologies, in, use, today, in, some, armies, the, weapon, of, artillery, is, the, projectile, not, the, equipment, that, fires, it, the, process, of, delivering, fire, onto, the, target, is, called, gunnery, the, actions, involved, in, operating, an, artillery, piece, are, collectively, called, serving, the, gun, by, the, detachment, or, gun, crew, constituting, either, direct, or, indirect, artillery, fire, the, manner, in, which, gunnery, crews, or, formations, are, employed, is, called, artillery, support, at, different, periods, in, history, this, may, refer, to, weapons, designed, to, be, fired, from, ground, sea, and, even, air, based, weapons, platforms, some, armed, forces, use, the, term, gunners, for, the, soldiers, and, sailors, with, the, primary, function, of, using, artillery, the, gunners, and, their, guns, are, usually, grouped, in, teams, called, either, crews, or, detachments, several, such, crews, and, teams, with, other, functions, are, combined, into, a, unit, of, artillery, usually, called, a, battery, although, sometimes, called, a, company, in, gun, detachments, each, role, is, numbered, starting, with, 1, the, detachment, commander, and, the, highest, number, being, the, coverer, the, second, in, command, gunner, is, also, the, lowest, rank, and, junior, non, commissioned, officers, are, bombardiers, in, some, artillery, arms, batteries, are, roughly, equivalent, to, a, company, in, the, infantry, and, are, combined, into, larger, military, organizations, for, administrative, and, operational, purposes, either, battalions, or, regiments, depending, on, the, army, these, may, be, grouped, into, brigades, the, russian, army, also, groups, some, brigades, into, artillery, divisions, and, the, people, s, liberation, army, has, artillery, corps, the, term, artillery, also, designates, a, combat, arm, of, most, military, services, when, used, organizationally, to, describe, units, and, formations, of, the, national, armed, forces, that, operate, the, weapons, during, military, operations, field, artillery, has, the, role, of, providing, support, to, other, arms, in, combat, or, of, attacking, targets, particularly, in, depth, broadly, these, effects, fall, into, two, categories, aiming, either, to, suppress, or, neutralize, the, enemy, or, to, cause, casualties, damage, and, destruction, this, is, mostly, achieved, by, delivering, high, explosive, munitions, to, suppress, or, inflict, casualties, on, the, enemy, from, casing, fragments, and, other, debris, and, from, blast, or, by, destroying, enemy, positions, equipment, and, vehicles, non, lethal, munitions, notably, smoke, can, also, suppress, or, neutralize, the, enemy, by, obscuring, their, view, fire, may, be, directed, by, an, artillery, observer, or, another, observer, including, crewed, and, uncrewed, aircraft, or, called, onto, map, coordinates, military, doctrine, has, had, a, significant, influence, on, the, core, engineering, design, considerations, of, artillery, ordnance, through, its, history, in, seeking, to, achieve, a, balance, between, the, delivered, volume, of, fire, with, ordnance, mobility, however, during, the, modern, period, the, consideration, of, protecting, the, gunners, also, arose, due, to, the, late, 19th, century, introduction, of, the, new, generation, of, infantry, weapons, using, conoidal, bullet, better, known, as, the, mini, ball, with, a, range, almost, as, long, as, that, of, field, artillery, the, gunners, increasing, proximity, to, and, participation, in, direct, combat, against, other, combat, arms, and, attacks, by, aircraft, made, the, introduction, of, a, gun, shield, necessary, the, problems, of, how, to, employ, a, fixed, or, horse, towed, gun, in, mobile, warfare, necessitated, the, development, of, new, methods, of, transporting, the, artillery, into, combat, two, distinct, forms, of, artillery, were, developed, the, towed, gun, used, primarily, to, attack, or, defend, a, fixed, line, and, the, self, propelled, gun, intended, to, accompany, a, mobile, force, and, to, provide, continuous, fire, support, and, or, suppression, these, influences, have, guided, the, development, of, artillery, ordnance, systems, organizations, and, operations, until, the, present, with, artillery, systems, capable, of, providing, support, at, ranges, from, as, little, as, 100, m, to, the, intercontinental, ranges, of, ballistic, missiles, the, only, combat, in, which, artillery, is, unable, to, take, part, is, close, quarters, combat, with, the, possible, exception, of, artillery, reconnaissance, teams, the, word, as, used, in, the, current, context, originated, in, the, middle, ages, one, suggestion, is, that, it, comes, from, french, atelier, meaning, the, place, where, manual, work, is, done, another, suggestion, is, that, it, originates, from, the, 13th, century, and, the, old, french, artillier, designating, craftsmen, and, manufacturers, of, all, materials, and, warfare, equipments, spears, swords, armor, war, machines, and, for, the, next, 250, years, the, sense, of, the, word, artillery, covered, all, forms, of, military, weapons, hence, the, naming, of, the, honourable, artillery, company, which, was, essentially, an, infantry, unit, until, the, 19th, century, another, suggestion, is, that, it, comes, from, the, italian, arte, de, tirare, art, of, shooting, coined, by, one, of, the, first, theorists, on, the, use, of, artillery, niccol, tartaglia, mechanical, systems, used, for, throwing, ammunition, in, ancient, warfare, also, known, as, engines, of, war, like, the, catapult, onager, trebuchet, and, ballista, are, also, referred, to, by, military, historians, as, artillery, during, medieval, times, more, types, of, artillery, were, developed, most, notably, the, counterweight, trebuchet, traction, trebuchets, using, manpower, to, launch, projectiles, have, been, used, in, ancient, china, since, the, 4th, century, as, anti, personnel, weapons, the, much, more, powerful, counterweight, trebuchet, was, invented, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, region, in, the, 12th, century, with, the, earliest, definite, attestation, in, 1187, early, chinese, artillery, had, vase, like, shapes, this, includes, the, long, range, awe, inspiring, cannon, dated, from, 1350, and, found, in, the, 14th, century, ming, dynasty, treatise, huolongjing, with, the, development, of, better, metallurgy, techniques, later, cannons, abandoned, the, vase, shape, of, early, chinese, artillery, this, change, can, be, seen, in, the, bronze, thousand, ball, thunder, cannon, an, early, example, of, field, artillery, these, small, crude, weapons, diffused, into, the, middle, east, the, madfaa, and, reached, europe, in, the, 13th, century, in, a, very, limited, manner, in, asia, mongols, adopted, the, chinese, artillery, and, used, it, effectively, in, the, great, conquest, by, the, late, 14th, century, chinese, rebels, used, organized, artillery, and, cavalry, to, push, mongols, out, as, small, smooth, bore, barrels, these, were, initially, cast, in, iron, or, bronze, around, a, core, with, the, first, drilled, bore, ordnance, recorded, in, operation, near, seville, in, 1247, they, fired, lead, iron, or, stone, balls, sometimes, large, arrows, and, on, occasions, simply, handfuls, of, whatever, scrap, came, to, hand, during, the, hundred, years, war, these, weapons, became, more, common, initially, as, the, bombard, and, later, the, cannon, cannon, were, always, muzzle, loaders, while, there, were, many, early, attempts, at, breech, loading, designs, a, lack, of, engineering, knowledge, rendered, these, even, more, dangerous, to, use, than, muzzle, loaders, in, 1415, the, portuguese, invaded, the, mediterranean, port, town, of, ceuta, while, it, is, difficult, to, confirm, the, use, of, firearms, in, the, siege, of, the, city, it, is, known, the, portuguese, defended, it, thereafter, with, firearms, namely, bombardas, colebratas, and, falconetes, in, 1419, sultan, abu, sa, id, led, an, army, to, reconquer, the, fallen, city, and, marinids, brought, cannons, and, used, them, in, the, assault, on, ceuta, finally, hand, held, firearms, and, riflemen, appear, in, morocco, in, 1437, in, an, expedition, against, the, people, of, tangiers, it, is, clear, these, weapons, had, developed, into, several, different, forms, from, small, guns, to, large, artillery, pieces, the, artillery, revolution, in, europe, caught, on, during, the, hundred, years, war, and, changed, the, way, that, battles, were, fought, in, the, preceding, decades, the, english, had, even, used, a, gunpowder, like, weapon, in, military, campaigns, against, the, scottish, however, at, this, time, the, cannons, used, in, battle, were, very, small, and, not, particularly, powerful, cannons, were, only, useful, for, the, defense, of, a, castle, as, demonstrated, at, breteuil, in, 1356, when, the, besieged, english, used, a, cannon, to, destroy, an, attacking, french, assault, tower, by, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, cannon, were, only, powerful, enough, to, knock, in, roofs, and, could, not, penetrate, castle, walls, however, a, major, change, occurred, between, 1420, and, 1430, when, artillery, became, much, more, powerful, and, could, now, batter, strongholds, and, fortresses, quite, efficiently, the, english, french, and, burgundians, all, advanced, in, military, technology, and, as, a, result, the, traditional, advantage, that, went, to, the, defense, in, a, siege, was, lost, the, cannon, during, this, period, were, elongated, and, the, recipe, for, gunpowder, was, improved, to, make, it, three, times, as, powerful, as, before, these, changes, led, to, the, increased, power, in, the, artillery, weapons, of, the, time, joan, of, arc, encountered, gunpowder, weaponry, several, times, when, she, led, the, french, against, the, english, at, the, battle, of, tourelles, in, 1430, she, faced, heavy, gunpowder, fortifications, and, yet, her, troops, prevailed, in, that, battle, in, addition, she, led, assaults, against, the, english, held, towns, of, jargeau, meung, and, beaugency, all, with, the, support, of, large, artillery, units, when, she, led, the, assault, on, paris, joan, faced, stiff, artillery, fire, especially, from, the, suburb, of, st, denis, which, ultimately, led, to, her, defeat, in, this, battle, in, april, 1430, she, went, to, battle, against, the, burgundians, whose, support, was, purchased, by, the, english, at, this, time, the, burgundians, had, the, strongest, and, largest, gunpowder, arsenal, among, the, european, powers, and, yet, the, french, under, joan, of, arc, s, leadership, were, able, to, beat, back, the, burgundians, and, defend, themselves, as, a, result, most, of, the, battles, of, the, hundred, years, war, that, joan, of, arc, participated, in, were, fought, with, gunpowder, artillery, the, army, of, mehmet, the, conqueror, which, conquered, constantinople, in, 1453, included, both, artillery, and, foot, soldiers, armed, with, gunpowder, weapons, the, ottomans, brought, to, the, siege, sixty, nine, guns, in, fifteen, separate, batteries, and, trained, them, at, the, walls, of, the, city, the, barrage, of, ottoman, cannon, fire, lasted, forty, days, and, they, are, estimated, to, have, fired, 19, 320, times, artillery, also, played, a, decisive, role, in, the, battle, of, st, jakob, an, der, birs, of, 1444, early, cannon, were, not, always, reliable, king, james, ii, of, scotland, was, killed, by, the, accidental, explosion, of, one, of, his, own, cannon, imported, from, flanders, at, the, siege, of, roxburgh, castle, in, 1460, the, able, use, of, artillery, supported, to, a, large, measure, the, expansion, and, defense, of, the, portuguese, empire, as, it, was, a, necessary, tool, that, allowed, the, portuguese, to, face, overwhelming, odds, both, on, land, and, sea, from, morocco, to, asia, in, great, sieges, and, in, sea, battles, the, portuguese, demonstrated, a, level, of, proficiency, in, the, use, of, artillery, after, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, unequalled, by, contemporary, european, neighbours, in, part, due, to, the, experience, gained, in, intense, fighting, in, morocco, which, served, as, a, proving, ground, for, artillery, and, its, practical, application, and, made, portugal, a, forerunner, in, gunnery, for, decades, during, the, reign, of, king, manuel, 1495, 1521, at, least, 2017, cannon, were, sent, to, morocco, for, garrison, defense, with, more, than, 3000, cannon, estimated, to, have, been, required, during, that, 26, year, period, an, especially, noticeable, division, between, siege, guns, and, anti, personnel, guns, enhanced, the, use, and, effectiveness, of, portuguese, firearms, above, contemporary, powers, making, cannon, the, most, essential, element, in, the, portuguese, arsenal, the, three, major, classes, of, portuguese, artillery, were, anti, personnel, guns, with, a, high, borelength, including, rebrodequim, ber, o, falconete, falc, o, sacre, spide, c, o, serpentina, and, passavolante, bastion, guns, which, could, batter, fortifications, camelete, le, o, pelicano, basilisco, guia, camelo, roqueira, urso, and, howitzers, that, fired, large, stone, cannonballs, in, an, elevated, arch, weighted, up, to, 4000, pounds, and, could, fire, incendiary, devices, such, as, a, hollow, iron, ball, filled, with, pitch, and, fuse, designed, to, be, fired, at, close, range, and, burst, on, contact, the, most, popular, in, portuguese, arsenals, was, the, ber, o, a, 5, cm, one, pounder, bronze, breech, loading, cannon, that, weighted, 150, kg, with, an, effective, range, of, 600, meters, a, tactical, innovation, the, portuguese, introduced, in, fort, defense, was, the, use, of, combinations, of, projectiles, against, massed, assaults, although, canister, shot, had, been, developed, in, the, early, 15th, century, the, portuguese, were, the, first, to, employ, it, extensively, and, portuguese, engineers, invented, a, canister, round, which, consisted, of, a, thin, lead, case, filled, with, iron, pellets, that, broke, up, at, the, muzzle, and, scattered, its, contents, in, a, narrow, pattern, an, innovation, which, portugal, adopted, in, advance, of, other, european, powers, was, fuse, delayed, action, shells, and, were, commonly, used, in, 1505, although, dangerous, their, effectiveness, meant, a, sixth, of, all, rounds, used, by, the, portuguese, in, morocco, were, of, the, fused, shell, variety, the, new, ming, dynasty, established, the, divine, engine, battalion, which, specialized, in, various, types, of, artillery, light, cannons, and, cannons, with, multiple, volleys, were, developed, in, a, campaign, to, suppress, a, local, minority, rebellion, near, today, s, burmese, border, the, ming, army, used, a, 3, line, method, of, arquebuses, muskets, to, destroy, an, elephant, formation, when, the, portuguese, and, spanish, arrived, at, southeast, asia, they, found, that, the, local, kingdoms, were, already, using, cannons, portuguese, and, spanish, invaders, were, unpleasantly, surprised, and, even, outgunned, on, occasion, duarte, barbosa, ca, 1514, said, that, the, inhabitants, of, java, were, great, masters, in, casting, artillery, and, very, good, artillerymen, they, made, many, one, pounder, cannons, cetbang, or, rentaka, long, muskets, spingarde, arquebus, schioppi, hand, cannon, greek, fire, guns, cannons, and, other, fire, works, in, all, aspects, the, javanese, were, considered, excellent, in, casting, artillery, and, in, the, knowledge, of, using, it, 254, 198, 224, in, 1513, the, javanese, fleet, led, by, pati, unus, sailed, to, attack, portuguese, malacca, with, much, artillery, made, in, java, for, the, javanese, are, skilled, in, founding, and, casting, and, in, all, works, in, iron, over, and, above, what, they, have, in, india, 162, 23, by, the, early, 16th, century, the, javanese, already, locally, producing, large, guns, some, of, them, still, survived, until, the, present, day, and, dubbed, as, sacred, cannon, or, holy, cannon, these, cannons, varied, between, 180, and, 260, pounders, weighing, anywhere, between, 3, 8, tons, measuring, between, 3, 6, m, between, 1593, and, 1597, about, 200, 000, korean, and, chinese, troops, which, fought, against, japan, in, korea, actively, used, heavy, artillery, in, both, siege, and, field, combat, korean, forces, mounted, artillery, in, ships, as, naval, guns, providing, an, advantage, against, japanese, navy, which, used, kunikuzushi, japanese, breech, loading, swivel, gun, and, zutsu, large, size, tanegashima, as, their, largest, firearms, bombards, were, of, value, mainly, in, sieges, a, famous, turkish, example, used, at, the, siege, of, constantinople, in, 1453, weighed, 19, tons, took, 200, men, and, sixty, oxen, to, emplace, and, could, fire, just, seven, times, a, day, the, fall, of, constantinople, was, perhaps, the, first, event, of, supreme, importance, whose, result, was, determined, by, the, use, of, artillery, when, the, huge, bronze, cannons, of, mehmed, ii, breached, the, city, s, walls, ending, the, byzantine, empire, according, to, sir, charles, oman, bombards, developed, in, europe, were, massive, smoothbore, weapons, distinguished, by, their, lack, of, a, field, carriage, immobility, once, emplaced, highly, individual, design, and, noted, unreliability, in, 1460, james, ii, king, of, scots, was, killed, when, one, exploded, at, the, siege, of, roxburgh, their, large, size, precluded, the, barrels, being, cast, and, they, were, constructed, out, of, metal, staves, or, rods, bound, together, with, hoops, like, a, barrel, giving, their, name, to, the, gun, barrel, the, use, of, the, word, cannon, marks, the, introduction, in, the, 15th, century, of, a, dedicated, field, carriage, with, axle, trail, and, animal, drawn, limber, this, produced, mobile, field, pieces, that, could, move, and, support, an, army, in, action, rather, than, being, found, only, in, the, siege, and, static, defenses, the, reduction, in, the, size, of, the, barrel, was, due, to, improvements, in, both, iron, technology, and, gunpowder, manufacture, while, the, development, of, trunnions, projections, at, the, side, of, the, cannon, as, an, integral, part, of, the, cast, allowed, the, barrel, to, be, fixed, to, a, more, movable, base, and, also, made, raising, or, lowering, the, barrel, much, easier, the, first, land, based, mobile, weapon, is, usually, credited, to, jan, i, ka, who, deployed, his, oxen, hauled, cannon, during, the, hussite, wars, of, bohemia, 1418, 1424, however, cannons, were, still, large, and, cumbersome, with, the, rise, of, musketry, in, the, 16th, century, cannon, were, largely, though, not, entirely, displaced, from, the, battlefield, the, cannon, were, too, slow, and, cumbersome, to, be, used, and, too, easily, lost, to, a, rapid, enemy, advance, the, combining, of, shot, and, powder, into, a, single, unit, a, cartridge, occurred, in, the, 1620s, with, a, simple, fabric, bag, and, was, quickly, adopted, by, all, nations, it, speeded, loading, and, made, it, safer, but, unexpelled, bag, fragments, were, an, additional, fouling, in, the, gun, barrel, and, a, new, tool, a, worm, was, introduced, to, remove, them, gustavus, adolphus, is, identified, as, the, general, who, made, cannon, an, effective, force, on, the, battlefield, pushing, the, development, of, much, lighter, and, smaller, weapons, and, deploying, them, in, far, greater, numbers, than, previously, the, outcome, of, battles, was, still, determined, by, the, clash, of, infantry, shells, explosive, filled, fused, projectiles, were, in, use, by, the, 15th, century, the, development, of, specialized, pieces, shipboard, artillery, howitzers, and, mortars, was, also, begun, in, this, period, more, esoteric, designs, like, the, multi, barrel, ribauldequin, known, as, organ, guns, were, also, produced, the, 1650, book, by, kazimierz, siemienowicz, artis, magnae, artilleriae, pars, prima, was, one, of, the, most, important, contemporary, publications, on, the, subject, of, artillery, for, over, two, centuries, this, work, was, used, in, europe, as, a, basic, artillery, manual, one, of, the, most, significant, effects, of, artillery, during, this, period, was, however, somewhat, more, indirect, by, easily, reducing, to, rubble, any, medieval, type, fortification, or, city, wall, some, which, had, stood, since, roman, times, it, abolished, millennia, of, siege, warfare, strategies, and, styles, of, fortification, building, this, led, among, other, things, to, a, frenzy, of, new, bastion, style, fortifications, to, be, built, all, over, europe, and, in, its, colonies, but, also, had, a, strong, integrating, effect, on, emerging, nation, states, as, kings, were, able, to, use, their, newfound, artillery, superiority, to, force, any, local, dukes, or, lords, to, submit, to, their, will, setting, the, stage, for, the, absolutist, kingdoms, to, come, modern, rocket, artillery, can, trace, its, heritage, back, to, the, mysorean, rockets, of, mysore, their, first, recorded, use, was, in, 1780, during, the, battles, of, the, second, third, and, fourth, mysore, wars, the, wars, fought, between, the, british, east, india, company, and, the, kingdom, of, mysore, in, india, made, use, of, the, rockets, as, a, weapon, in, the, battle, of, pollilur, the, siege, of, seringapatam, 1792, and, in, battle, of, seringapatam, in, 1799, these, rockets, were, used, with, considerable, effect, against, the, british, after, the, wars, several, mysore, rockets, were, sent, to, england, but, experiments, with, heavier, payloads, were, unsuccessful, in, 1804, william, congreve, considering, the, mysorian, rockets, to, have, too, short, a, range, less, than, 1, 000, yards, developed, rockets, in, numerous, sizes, with, ranges, up, to, 3, 000, yards, and, eventually, utilizing, iron, casing, as, the, congreve, rocket, which, were, used, effectively, during, the, napoleonic, wars, and, the, war, of, 1812, with, the, napoleonic, wars, artillery, experienced, changes, in, both, physical, design, and, operation, rather, than, being, overseen, by, mechanics, artillery, was, viewed, as, its, own, service, branch, with, the, capability, of, dominating, the, battlefield, the, success, of, the, french, artillery, companies, was, at, least, in, part, due, to, the, presence, of, specially, trained, artillery, officers, leading, and, coordinating, during, the, chaos, of, battle, napoleon, himself, a, former, artillery, officer, perfected, the, tactic, of, massed, artillery, batteries, unleashed, upon, a, critical, point, in, his, enemies, line, as, a, prelude, to, a, decisive, infantry, and, cavalry, assault, physically, cannons, continued, to, become, smaller, and, lighter, during, the, seven, years, war, king, frederick, ii, of, prussia, used, these, advances, to, deploy, horse, artillery, that, could, move, throughout, the, battlefield, frederick, also, introduced, the, reversible, iron, ramrod, which, was, much, more, resistant, to, breakage, than, older, wooden, designs, the, reversibility, aspect, also, helped, increase, the, rate, of, fire, since, a, soldier, would, no, longer, have, to, worry, about, what, end, of, the, ramrod, they, were, using, jean, baptiste, de, gribeauval, a, french, artillery, engineer, introduced, the, standardization, of, cannon, design, in, the, mid, 18th, century, he, developed, a, 6, inch, 150, mm, field, howitzer, whose, gun, barrel, carriage, assembly, and, ammunition, specifications, were, made, uniform, for, all, french, cannons, the, standardized, interchangeable, parts, of, these, cannons, down, to, the, nuts, bolts, and, screws, made, their, mass, production, and, repair, much, easier, while, the, gribeauval, system, made, for, more, efficient, production, and, assembly, the, carriages, used, were, heavy, and, the, gunners, were, forced, to, march, on, foot, instead, of, riding, on, the, limber, and, gun, as, in, the, british, system, each, cannon, was, named, for, the, weight, of, its, projectiles, giving, us, variants, such, as, 4, 8, and, 12, indicating, the, weight, in, pounds, the, projectiles, themselves, included, solid, balls, or, canister, containing, lead, bullets, or, other, material, these, canister, shots, acted, as, massive, shotguns, peppering, the, target, with, hundreds, of, projectiles, at, close, range, the, solid, balls, known, as, round, shot, was, most, effective, when, fired, at, shoulder, height, across, a, flat, open, area, the, ball, would, tear, through, the, ranks, of, the, enemy, or, bounce, along, the, ground, breaking, legs, and, ankles, the, development, of, modern, artillery, occurred, in, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, as, a, result, of, the, convergence, of, various, improvements, in, the, underlying, technology, advances, in, metallurgy, allowed, for, the, construction, of, breech, loading, rifled, guns, that, could, fire, at, a, much, greater, muzzle, velocity, after, the, british, artillery, was, shown, up, in, the, crimean, war, as, having, barely, changed, since, the, napoleonic, wars, the, industrialist, william, armstrong, was, awarded, a, contract, by, the, government, to, design, a, new, piece, of, artillery, production, started, in, 1855, at, the, elswick, ordnance, company, and, the, royal, arsenal, at, woolwich, and, the, outcome, was, the, revolutionary, armstrong, gun, which, marked, the, birth, of, modern, artillery, three, of, its, features, particularly, stand, out, first, the, piece, was, rifled, which, allowed, for, a, much, more, accurate, and, powerful, action, although, rifling, had, been, tried, on, small, arms, since, the, 15th, century, the, necessary, machinery, to, accurately, rifle, artillery, was, not, available, until, the, mid, 19th, century, martin, von, wahrendorff, and, joseph, whitworth, independently, produced, rifled, cannon, in, the, 1840s, but, it, was, armstrong, s, gun, that, was, first, to, see, widespread, use, during, the, crimean, war, the, cast, iron, shell, of, the, armstrong, gun, was, similar, in, shape, to, a, mini, ball, and, had, a, thin, lead, coating, which, made, it, fractionally, larger, than, the, gun, s, bore, and, which, engaged, with, the, gun, s, rifling, grooves, to, impart, spin, to, the, shell, this, spin, together, with, the, elimination, of, windage, as, a, result, of, the, tight, fit, enabled, the, gun, to, achieve, greater, range, and, accuracy, than, existing, smooth, bore, muzzle, loaders, with, a, smaller, powder, charge, his, gun, was, also, a, breech, loader, although, attempts, at, breech, loading, mechanisms, had, been, made, since, medieval, times, the, essential, engineering, problem, was, that, the, mechanism, could, not, withstand, the, explosive, charge, it, was, only, with, the, advances, in, metallurgy, and, precision, engineering, capabilities, during, the, industrial, revolution, that, armstrong, was, able, to, construct, a, viable, solution, the, gun, combined, all, the, properties, that, make, up, an, effective, artillery, piece, the, gun, was, mounted, on, a, carriage, in, such, a, way, as, to, return, the, gun, to, firing, position, after, the, recoil, what, made, the, gun, really, revolutionary, lay, in, the, technique, of, the, construction, of, the, gun, barrel, that, allowed, it, to, withstand, much, more, powerful, explosive, forces, the, built, up, method, involved, assembling, the, barrel, with, wrought, iron, later, mild, steel, was, used, tubes, of, successively, smaller, diameter, the, tube, would, then, be, heated, to, allow, it, to, expand, and, fit, over, the, previous, tube, when, it, cooled, the, gun, would, contract, although, not, back, to, its, original, size, which, allowed, an, even, pressure, along, the, walls, of, the, gun, which, was, directed, inward, against, the, outward, forces, that, the, gun, s, firing, exerted, on, the, barrel, another, innovative, feature, more, usually, associated, with, 20th, century, guns, was, what, armstrong, called, its, grip, which, was, essentially, a, squeeze, bore, the, 6, inches, of, the, bore, at, the, muzzle, end, was, of, slightly, smaller, diameter, which, centered, the, shell, before, it, left, the, barrel, and, at, the, same, time, slightly, swaged, down, its, lead, coating, reducing, its, diameter, and, slightly, improving, its, ballistic, qualities, armstrong, s, system, was, adopted, in, 1858, initially, for, special, service, in, the, field, and, initially, he, produced, only, smaller, artillery, pieces, 6, pounder, 2, 5, in, 64, mm, mountain, or, light, field, guns, 9, pounder, 3, in, 76, mm, guns, for, horse, artillery, and, 12, pounder, 3, inches, 76, mm, field, guns, the, first, cannon, to, contain, all, modern, features, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, french, 75, of, 1897, the, gun, used, cased, ammunition, was, breech, loading, had, modern, sights, and, a, self, contained, firing, mechanism, it, was, the, first, field, gun, to, include, a, hydro, pneumatic, recoil, mechanism, which, kept, the, gun, s, trail, and, wheels, perfectly, still, during, the, firing, sequence, since, it, did, not, need, to, be, re, aimed, after, each, shot, the, crew, could, fire, as, soon, as, the, barrel, returned, to, its, resting, position, in, typical, use, the, french, 75, could, deliver, fifteen, rounds, per, minute, on, its, target, either, shrapnel, or, melinite, high, explosive, up, to, about, 5, miles, 8, 500, m, away, its, firing, rate, could, even, reach, close, to, 30, rounds, per, minute, albeit, only, for, a, very, short, time, and, with, a, highly, experienced, crew, these, were, rates, that, contemporary, bolt, action, rifles, could, not, match, indirect, fire, the, firing, of, a, projectile, without, relying, on, direct, line, of, sight, between, the, gun, and, the, target, possibly, dates, back, to, the, 16th, century, early, battlefield, use, of, indirect, fire, may, have, occurred, at, paltzig, in, july, 1759, when, the, russian, artillery, fired, over, the, tops, of, trees, and, at, the, battle, of, waterloo, where, a, battery, of, the, royal, horse, artillery, fired, shrapnel, indirectly, against, advancing, french, troops, in, 1882, russian, lieutenant, colonel, kg, guk, published, indirect, fire, for, field, artillery, which, provided, a, practical, method, of, using, aiming, points, for, indirect, fire, by, describing, all, the, essentials, of, aiming, points, crest, clearance, and, corrections, to, fire, by, an, observer, a, few, years, later, the, richtfl, che, lining, plane, sight, was, invented, in, germany, and, provided, a, means, of, indirect, laying, in, azimuth, complementing, the, clinometers, for, indirect, laying, in, elevation, which, already, existed, despite, conservative, opposition, within, the, german, army, indirect, fire, was, adopted, as, doctrine, by, the, 1890s, in, the, early, 1900s, goertz, in, germany, developed, an, optical, sight, for, azimuth, laying, it, quickly, replaced, the, lining, plane, in, english, it, became, the, dial, sight, uk, or, panoramic, telescope, us, the, british, halfheartedly, experimented, with, indirect, fire, techniques, since, the, 1890s, but, with, the, onset, of, the, boer, war, they, were, the, first, to, apply, the, theory, in, practice, in, 1899, although, they, had, to, improvise, without, a, lining, plane, sight, in, the, next, 15, years, leading, up, to, world, war, i, the, techniques, of, indirect, fire, became, available, for, all, types, of, artillery, indirect, fire, was, the, defining, characteristic, of, 20th, century, artillery, and, led, to, undreamt, of, changes, in, the, amount, of, artillery, its, tactics, organisation, and, techniques, most, of, which, occurred, during, world, war, i, an, implication, of, indirect, fire, and, improving, guns, was, increasing, range, between, gun, and, target, this, increased, the, time, of, flight, and, the, vertex, of, the, trajectory, the, result, was, decreasing, accuracy, the, increasing, distance, between, the, target, and, the, mean, point, of, impact, of, the, shells, aimed, at, it, caused, by, the, increasing, effects, of, non, standard, conditions, indirect, firing, data, was, based, on, standard, conditions, including, a, specific, muzzle, velocity, zero, wind, air, temperature, and, density, and, propellant, temperature, in, practice, this, standard, combination, of, conditions, almost, never, existed, they, varied, throughout, the, day, and, day, to, day, and, the, greater, the, time, of, flight, the, greater, the, inaccuracy, an, added, complication, was, the, need, for, survey, to, accurately, fix, the, coordinates, of, the, gun, position, and, provide, accurate, orientation, for, the, guns, of, course, targets, had, to, be, accurately, located, but, by, 1916, air, photo, interpretation, techniques, enabled, this, and, ground, survey, techniques, could, sometimes, be, used, in, 1914, the, methods, of, correcting, firing, data, for, the, actual, conditions, were, often, convoluted, and, the, availability, of, data, about, actual, conditions, was, rudimentary, or, non, existent, the, assumption, was, that, fire, would, always, be, ranged, adjusted, british, heavy, artillery, worked, energetically, to, progressively, solve, all, these, problems, from, late, 1914, onwards, and, by, early, 1918, had, effective, processes, in, place, for, both, field, and, heavy, artillery, these, processes, enabled, map, shooting, later, called, predicted, fire, it, meant, that, effective, fire, could, be, delivered, against, an, accurately, located, target, without, ranging, nevertheless, the, mean, point, of, impact, was, still, some, tens, of, yards, from, the, target, centre, aiming, point, it, was, not, precision, fire, but, it, was, good, enough, for, concentrations, and, barrages, these, processes, remain, in, use, into, the, 21st, century, with, refinements, to, calculations, enabled, by, computers, and, improved, data, capture, about, non, standard, conditions, the, british, major, general, henry, hugh, tudor, pioneered, armour, and, artillery, cooperation, at, the, breakthrough, battle, of, cambrai, the, improvements, in, providing, and, using, data, for, non, standard, conditions, propellant, temperature, muzzle, velocity, wind, air, temperature, and, barometric, pressure, were, developed, by, the, major, combatants, throughout, the, war, and, enabled, effective, predicted, fire, the, effectiveness, of, this, was, demonstrated, by, the, british, in, 1917, at, cambrai, and, by, germany, the, following, year, operation, michael, major, general, j, b, a, bailey, british, army, retired, wrote, from, the, middle, of, the, eighteenth, century, to, the, middle, of, the, nineteenth, artillery, is, judged, to, have, accounted, for, perhaps, 50, of, battlefield, casualties, in, the, sixty, years, preceding, 1914, this, figure, was, probably, as, low, as, 10, percent, the, remaining, 90, percent, fell, to, small, arms, whose, range, and, accuracy, had, come, to, rival, those, of, artillery, the, british, royal, artillery, at, over, one, million, men, grew, to, be, larger, than, the, royal, navy, bellamy, 1986, pp, 1, 7, cites, the, percentage, of, casualties, caused, by, artillery, in, various, theaters, since, 1914, in, the, first, world, war, 45, percent, of, russian, casualties, and, 58, percent, of, british, casualties, on, the, western, front, in, the, second, world, war, 75, percent, of, british, casualties, in, north, africa, and, 51, percent, of, soviet, casualties, 61, percent, in, 1945, and, 70, percent, of, german, casualties, on, the, eastern, front, and, in, the, korean, war, 60, percent, of, us, casualties, including, those, inflicted, by, mortars, an, estimated, 75, 000, french, soldiers, were, casualties, of, friendly, artillery, fire, in, the, four, years, of, world, war, i, modern, artillery, is, most, obviously, distinguished, by, its, long, range, firing, an, explosive, shell, or, rocket, and, a, mobile, carriage, for, firing, and, transport, however, its, most, important, characteristic, is, the, use, of, indirect, fire, whereby, the, firing, equipment, is, aimed, without, seeing, the, target, through, its, sights, indirect, fire, emerged, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, and, was, greatly, enhanced, by, the, development, of, predicted, fire, methods, in, world, war, i, however, indirect, fire, was, area, fire, it, was, and, is, not, suitable, for, destroying, point, targets, its, primary, purpose, is, area, suppression, nevertheless, by, the, late, 1970s, precision, guided, munitions, started, to, appear, notably, the, us, 155, mm, copperhead, and, its, soviet, 152, mm, krasnopol, equivalent, that, had, success, in, indian, service, these, relied, on, laser, designation, to, illuminate, the, target, that, the, shell, homed, onto, however, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, global, positioning, system, gps, enabled, relatively, cheap, and, accurate, guidance, for, shells, and, missiles, notably, the, us, 155, mm, excalibur, and, the, 227, mm, gmlrs, rocket, the, introduction, of, these, led, to, a, new, issue, the, need, for, very, accurate, three, dimensional, target, coordinates, the, mensuration, process, weapons, covered, by, the, term, modern, artillery, include, cannon, artillery, such, as, howitzer, mortar, and, field, gun, and, rocket, artillery, certain, smaller, caliber, mortars, are, more, properly, designated, small, arms, rather, than, artillery, albeit, indirect, fire, small, arms, this, term, also, came, to, include, coastal, artillery, which, traditionally, defended, coastal, areas, against, seaborne, attack, and, controlled, the, passage, of, ships, with, the, advent, of, powered, flight, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, artillery, also, included, ground, based, anti, aircraft, batteries, the, term, artillery, has, traditionally, not, been, used, for, projectiles, with, internal, guidance, systems, preferring, the, term, missilery, though, some, modern, artillery, units, employ, surface, to, surface, missiles, advances, in, terminal, guidance, systems, for, small, munitions, has, allowed, large, caliber, guided, projectiles, to, be, developed, blurring, this, distinction, see, long, range, precision, fires, lrpf, joint, terminal, attack, controller, one, of, the, most, important, roles, of, logistics, is, the, supply, of, munitions, as, a, primary, type, of, artillery, consumable, their, storage, ammunition, dump, arsenal, magazine, and, the, provision, of, fuzes, detonators, and, warheads, at, the, point, where, artillery, troops, will, assemble, the, charge, projectile, bomb, or, shell, a, round, of, artillery, ammunition, comprises, four, components, fuzes, are, the, devices, that, initiate, an, artillery, projectile, either, to, detonate, its, high, explosive, he, filling, or, eject, its, cargo, illuminating, flare, or, smoke, canisters, being, examples, the, official, military, spelling, is, fuze, broadly, there, are, four, main, types, most, artillery, fuzes, are, nose, fuzes, however, base, fuzes, have, been, used, with, armor, piercing, shells, and, for, squash, head, high, explosive, squash, head, hesh, or, high, explosive, plastic, hep, anti, tank, shells, at, least, one, nuclear, shell, and, its, non, nuclear, spotting, version, also, used, a, multi, deck, mechanical, time, fuze, fitted, into, its, base, impact, fuzes, were, and, in, some, armies, remain, the, standard, fuze, for, he, projectiles, their, default, action, is, normally, superquick, some, have, had, a, graze, action, which, allows, them, to, penetrate, light, cover, and, others, have, delay, delay, fuzes, allow, the, shell, to, penetrate, the, ground, before, exploding, armor, or, concrete, piercing, ap, or, cp, fuzes, are, specially, hardened, during, world, war, i, and, later, ricochet, fire, with, delay, or, graze, fuzed, he, shells, fired, with, a, flat, angle, of, descent, was, used, to, achieve, airburst, he, shells, can, be, fitted, with, other, fuzes, airburst, fuzes, usually, have, a, combined, airburst, and, impact, function, however, until, the, introduction, of, proximity, fuzes, the, airburst, function, was, mostly, used, with, cargo, munitions, for, example, shrapnel, illumination, and, smoke, the, larger, calibers, of, anti, aircraft, artillery, are, almost, always, used, airburst, airburst, fuzes, have, to, have, the, fuze, length, running, time, set, on, them, this, is, done, just, before, firing, using, either, a, wrench, or, a, fuze, setter, pre, set, to, the, required, fuze, length, early, airburst, fuzes, used, igniferous, timers, which, lasted, into, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, mechanical, time, fuzes, appeared, in, the, early, part, of, the, century, these, required, a, means, of, powering, them, the, thiel, mechanism, used, a, spring, and, escapement, i, e, clockwork, junghans, used, centrifugal, force, and, gears, and, dixi, used, centrifugal, force, and, balls, from, about, 1980, electronic, time, fuzes, started, replacing, mechanical, ones, for, use, with, cargo, munitions, proximity, fuzes, have, been, of, two, types, photo, electric, or, radar, the, former, was, not, very, successful, and, seems, only, to, have, been, used, with, british, anti, aircraft, artillery, unrotated, projectiles, rockets, in, world, war, ii, radar, proximity, fuzes, were, a, big, improvement, over, the, mechanical, time, fuzes, which, they, replaced, mechanical, time, fuzes, required, an, accurate, calculation, of, their, running, time, which, was, affected, by, non, standard, conditions, with, he, requiring, a, burst, 20, to, 30, feet, 9, 1, m, above, the, ground, if, this, was, very, slightly, wrong, the, rounds, would, either, hit, the, ground, or, burst, too, high, accurate, running, time, was, less, important, with, cargo, munitions, that, burst, much, higher, the, first, radar, proximity, fuzes, perhaps, originally, codenamed, vt, and, later, called, variable, time, vt, were, invented, by, the, british, and, developed, by, the, us, and, initially, used, against, aircraft, in, world, war, ii, their, ground, use, was, delayed, for, fear, of, the, enemy, recovering, blinds, artillery, shells, which, failed, to, detonate, and, copying, the, fuze, the, first, proximity, fuzes, were, designed, to, detonate, about, 30, feet, 9, 1, m, above, the, ground, these, air, bursts, are, much, more, lethal, against, personnel, than, ground, bursts, because, they, deliver, a, greater, proportion, of, useful, fragments, and, deliver, them, into, terrain, where, a, prone, soldier, would, be, protected, from, ground, bursts, however, proximity, fuzes, can, suffer, premature, detonation, because, of, the, moisture, in, heavy, rain, clouds, this, led, to, controlled, variable, time, cvt, after, world, war, ii, these, fuzes, have, a, mechanical, timer, that, switched, on, the, radar, about, 5, seconds, before, expected, impact, they, also, detonated, on, impact, the, proximity, fuze, emerged, on, the, battlefields, of, europe, in, late, december, 1944, they, have, become, known, as, the, u, s, artillery, s, christmas, present, and, were, much, appreciated, when, they, arrived, during, the, battle, of, the, bulge, they, were, also, used, to, great, effect, in, anti, aircraft, projectiles, in, the, pacific, against, kamikaze, as, well, as, in, britain, against, v, 1, flying, bombs, electronic, multi, function, fuzes, started, to, appear, around, 1980, using, solid, state, electronics, they, were, relatively, cheap, and, reliable, and, became, the, standard, fitted, fuze, in, operational, ammunition, stocks, in, some, western, armies, the, early, versions, were, often, limited, to, proximity, airburst, albeit, with, height, of, burst, options, and, impact, some, offered, a, go, no, go, functional, test, through, the, fuze, setter, later, versions, introduced, induction, fuze, setting, and, testing, instead, of, physically, placing, a, fuze, setter, on, the, fuze, the, latest, such, as, junghan, s, dm84u, provide, options, giving, superquick, delay, a, choice, of, proximity, heights, of, burst, time, and, a, choice, of, foliage, penetration, depths, the, projectile, is, the, munition, or, bullet, fired, downrange, this, may, be, an, explosive, device, projectiles, have, traditionally, been, classified, as, shot, or, shell, the, former, being, solid, and, the, latter, having, some, form, of, payload, shells, can, be, divided, into, three, configurations, bursting, base, ejection, or, nose, ejection, the, latter, is, sometimes, called, the, shrapnel, configuration, the, most, modern, is, base, ejection, which, was, introduced, in, world, war, i, base, and, nose, ejection, are, almost, always, used, with, airburst, fuzes, bursting, shells, use, various, types, of, fuze, depending, on, the, nature, of, the, payload, and, the, tactical, need, at, the, time, payloads, have, included, most, forms, of, artillery, require, a, propellant, to, propel, the, projectile, to, the, target, propellant, is, always, a, low, explosive, which, means, it, deflagrates, rather, than, detonating, like, high, explosives, the, shell, is, accelerated, to, a, high, velocity, in, a, very, short, time, by, the, rapid, generation, of, gas, from, the, burning, propellant, this, high, pressure, is, achieved, by, burning, the, propellant, in, a, contained, area, either, the, chamber, of, a, gun, barrel, or, the, combustion, chamber, of, a, rocket, motor, until, the, late, 19th, century, the, only, available, propellant, was, black, powder, it, had, many, disadvantages, as, a, propellant, it, has, relatively, low, power, requiring, large, amounts, of, powder, to, fire, projectiles, and, created, thick, clouds, of, white, smoke, that, would, obscure, the, targets, betray, the, positions, of, guns, and, make, aiming, impossible, in, 1846, nitrocellulose, also, known, as, guncotton, was, discovered, and, the, high, explosive, nitroglycerin, was, discovered, at, nearly, the, same, time, nitrocellulose, was, significantly, more, powerful, than, black, powder, and, was, smokeless, early, guncotton, was, unstable, however, and, burned, very, fast, and, hot, leading, to, greatly, increased, barrel, wear, widespread, introduction, of, smokeless, powder, would, wait, until, the, advent, of, the, double, base, powders, which, combine, nitrocellulose, and, nitroglycerin, to, produce, powerful, smokeless, stable, propellant, many, other, formulations, were, developed, in, the, following, decades, generally, trying, to, find, the, optimum, characteristics, of, a, good, artillery, propellant, low, temperature, high, energy, non, corrosive, highly, stable, cheap, and, easy, to, manufacture, in, large, quantities, modern, gun, propellants, are, broadly, divided, into, three, classes, single, base, propellants, that, are, mainly, or, entirely, nitrocellulose, based, double, base, propellants, consisting, of, a, combination, of, nitrocellulose, and, nitroglycerin, and, triple, base, composed, of, a, combination, of, nitrocellulose, and, nitroglycerin, and, nitroguanidine, artillery, shells, fired, from, a, barrel, can, be, assisted, to, greater, range, in, three, ways, propelling, charges, for, barrel, artillery, can, be, provided, either, as, cartridge, bags, or, in, metal, cartridge, cases, generally, anti, aircraft, artillery, and, smaller, caliber, up, to, 3, or, 76, 2, mm, guns, use, metal, cartridge, cases, that, include, the, round, and, propellant, similar, to, a, modern, rifle, cartridge, this, simplifies, loading, and, is, necessary, for, very, high, rates, of, fire, bagged, propellant, allows, the, amount, of, powder, to, be, raised, or, lowered, depending, on, the, range, to, the, target, it, also, makes, handling, of, larger, shells, easier, cases, and, bags, require, totally, different, types, of, breech, a, metal, case, holds, an, integral, primer, to, initiate, the, propellant, and, provides, the, gas, seal, to, prevent, the, gases, leaking, out, of, the, breech, this, is, called, obturation, with, bagged, charges, the, breech, itself, provides, obturation, and, holds, the, primer, in, either, case, the, primer, is, usually, percussion, but, electrical, is, also, used, and, laser, ignition, is, emerging, modern, 155, mm, guns, have, a, primer, magazine, fitted, to, their, breech, artillery, ammunition, has, four, classifications, according, to, use, because, modern, field, artillery, mostly, uses, indirect, fire, the, guns, have, to, be, part, of, a, system, that, enables, them, to, attack, targets, invisible, to, them, in, accordance, with, the, combined, arms, plan, the, main, functions, in, the, field, artillery, system, are, all, these, calculations, to, produce, a, quadrant, elevation, or, range, and, azimuth, were, done, manually, using, instruments, tabulated, data, of, the, moment, and, approximations, until, battlefield, computers, started, appearing, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, while, some, early, calculators, copied, the, manual, method, typically, substituting, polynomials, for, tabulated, data, computers, use, a, different, approach, they, simulate, a, shell, s, trajectory, by, flying, it, in, short, steps, and, applying, data, about, the, conditions, affecting, the, trajectory, at, each, step, this, simulation, is, repeated, until, it, produces, a, quadrant, elevation, and, azimuth, that, lands, the, shell, within, the, required, closing, distance, of, the, target, coordinates, nato, has, a, standard, ballistic, model, for, computer, calculations, and, has, expanded, the, scope, of, this, into, the, nato, armaments, ballistic, kernel, nabk, within, the, sg2, shareable, fire, control, software, suite, s4, supply, of, artillery, ammunition, has, always, been, a, major, component, of, military, logistics, up, until, world, war, i, some, armies, made, artillery, responsible, for, all, forward, ammunition, supply, because, the, load, of, small, arms, ammunition, was, trivial, compared, to, artillery, different, armies, use, different, approaches, to, ammunition, supply, which, can, vary, with, the, nature, of, operations, differences, include, where, the, logistic, service, transfers, artillery, ammunition, to, artillery, the, amount, of, ammunition, carried, in, units, and, extent, to, which, stocks, are, held, at, unit, or, battery, level, a, key, difference, is, whether, supply, is, push, or, pull, in, the, former, the, pipeline, keeps, pushing, ammunition, into, formations, or, units, at, a, defined, rate, in, the, latter, units, fire, as, tactically, necessary, and, replenish, to, maintain, or, reach, their, authorised, holding, which, can, vary, so, the, logistic, system, has, to, be, able, to, cope, with, surge, and, slack, artillery, types, can, be, categorised, in, several, ways, for, example, by, type, or, size, of, weapon, or, ordnance, by, role, or, by, organizational, arrangements, the, types, of, cannon, artillery, are, generally, distinguished, by, the, velocity, at, which, they, fire, projectiles, types, of, artillery, modern, field, artillery, can, also, be, split, into, two, other, subcategories, towed, and, self, propelled, as, the, name, suggests, towed, artillery, has, a, prime, mover, usually, an, artillery, tractor, or, truck, to, move, the, piece, crew, and, ammunition, around, towed, artillery, is, in, some, cases, equipped, with, an, apu, for, small, displacements, self, propelled, artillery, is, permanently, mounted, on, a, carriage, or, vehicle, with, room, for, the, crew, and, ammunition, and, is, thus, capable, of, moving, quickly, from, one, firing, position, to, another, both, to, support, the, fluid, nature, of, modern, combat, and, to, avoid, counter, battery, fire, it, includes, mortar, carrier, vehicles, many, of, which, allow, the, mortar, to, be, removed, from, the, vehicle, and, be, used, dismounted, potentially, in, terrain, in, which, the, vehicle, cannot, navigate, or, in, order, to, avoid, detection, at, the, beginning, of, the, modern, artillery, period, the, late, 19th, century, many, armies, had, three, main, types, of, artillery, in, some, case, they, were, sub, branches, within, the, artillery, branch, in, others, they, were, separate, branches, or, corps, there, were, also, other, types, excluding, the, armament, fitted, to, warships, after, world, war, i, many, nations, merged, these, different, artillery, branches, in, some, cases, keeping, some, as, sub, branches, naval, artillery, disappeared, apart, from, that, belonging, to, marines, however, two, new, branches, of, artillery, emerged, during, that, war, and, its, aftermath, both, used, specialised, guns, and, a, few, rockets, and, used, direct, not, indirect, fire, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, both, started, to, make, extensive, use, of, missiles, however, the, general, switch, by, artillery, to, indirect, fire, before, and, during, world, war, i, led, to, a, reaction, in, some, armies, the, result, was, accompanying, or, infantry, guns, these, were, usually, small, short, range, guns, that, could, be, easily, man, handled, and, used, mostly, for, direct, fire, but, some, could, use, indirect, fire, some, were, operated, by, the, artillery, branch, but, under, command, of, the, supported, unit, in, world, war, ii, they, were, joined, by, self, propelled, assault, guns, although, other, armies, adopted, infantry, or, close, support, tanks, in, armoured, branch, units, for, the, same, purpose, subsequently, tanks, generally, took, on, the, accompanying, role, the, three, main, types, of, artillery, gun, are, field, guns, howitzers, and, mortars, during, the, 20th, century, guns, and, howitzers, have, steadily, merged, in, artillery, use, making, a, distinction, between, the, terms, somewhat, meaningless, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, true, guns, with, calibers, larger, than, about, 60, mm, have, become, very, rare, in, artillery, use, the, main, users, being, tanks, ships, and, a, few, residual, anti, aircraft, and, coastal, guns, the, term, cannon, is, a, united, states, generic, term, that, includes, guns, howitzers, and, mortars, it, is, not, used, in, other, english, speaking, armies, the, traditional, definitions, differentiated, between, guns, and, howitzers, in, terms, of, maximum, elevation, well, less, than, 45, as, opposed, to, close, to, or, greater, than, 45, number, of, charges, one, or, more, than, one, charge, and, having, higher, or, lower, muzzle, velocity, sometimes, indicated, by, barrel, length, these, three, criteria, give, eight, possible, combinations, of, which, guns, and, howitzers, are, but, two, however, modern, howitzers, have, higher, velocities, and, longer, barrels, than, the, equivalent, guns, of, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, true, guns, are, characterized, by, long, range, having, a, maximum, elevation, significantly, less, than, 45, a, high, muzzle, velocity, and, hence, a, relatively, long, barrel, smooth, bore, no, rifling, and, a, single, charge, the, latter, often, led, to, fixed, ammunition, where, the, projectile, is, locked, to, the, cartridge, case, there, is, no, generally, accepted, minimum, muzzle, velocity, or, barrel, length, associated, with, a, gun, howitzers, can, fire, at, maximum, elevations, at, least, close, to, 45, elevations, up, to, about, 70, are, normal, for, modern, howitzers, howitzers, also, have, a, choice, of, charges, meaning, that, the, same, elevation, angle, of, fire, will, achieve, a, different, range, depending, on, the, charge, used, they, have, rifled, bores, lower, muzzle, velocities, and, shorter, barrels, than, equivalent, guns, all, this, means, they, can, deliver, fire, with, a, steep, angle, of, descent, because, of, their, multi, charge, capability, their, ammunition, is, mostly, separate, loading, the, projectile, and, propellant, are, loaded, separately, that, leaves, six, combinations, of, the, three, criteria, some, of, which, have, been, termed, gun, howitzers, a, term, first, used, in, the, 1930s, when, howitzers, with, a, relatively, high, maximum, muzzle, velocities, were, introduced, it, never, became, widely, accepted, most, armies, electing, to, widen, the, definition, of, gun, or, howitzer, by, the, 1960s, most, equipment, had, maximum, elevations, up, to, about, 70, were, multi, charge, had, quite, high, maximum, muzzle, velocities, and, relatively, long, barrels, mortars, are, simpler, the, modern, mortar, originated, in, world, war, i, and, there, were, several, patterns, after, that, war, most, mortars, settled, on, the, stokes, pattern, characterized, by, a, short, barrel, smooth, bore, low, muzzle, velocity, elevation, angle, of, firing, generally, greater, than, 45, and, a, very, simple, and, light, mounting, using, a, baseplate, on, the, ground, the, projectile, with, its, integral, propelling, charge, was, dropped, down, the, barrel, from, the, muzzle, to, hit, a, fixed, firing, pin, since, that, time, a, few, mortars, have, become, rifled, and, adopted, breech, loading, there, are, other, recognized, typifying, characteristics, for, artillery, one, such, characteristic, is, the, type, of, obturation, used, to, seal, the, chamber, and, prevent, gases, escaping, through, the, breech, this, may, use, a, metal, cartridge, case, that, also, holds, the, propelling, charge, a, configuration, called, qf, or, quickfiring, by, some, nations, the, alternative, does, not, use, a, metal, cartridge, case, the, propellant, being, merely, bagged, or, in, combustible, cases, with, the, breech, itself, providing, all, the, sealing, this, is, called, bl, or, breech, loading, by, some, nations, a, second, characteristic, is, the, form, of, propulsion, modern, equipment, can, either, be, towed, or, self, propelled, sp, a, towed, gun, fires, from, the, ground, and, any, inherent, protection, is, limited, to, a, gun, shield, towing, by, horse, teams, lasted, throughout, world, war, ii, in, some, armies, but, others, were, fully, mechanized, with, wheeled, or, tracked, gun, towing, vehicles, by, the, outbreak, of, that, war, the, size, of, a, towing, vehicle, depends, on, the, weight, of, the, equipment, and, the, amount, of, ammunition, it, has, to, carry, a, variation, of, towed, is, portee, where, the, vehicle, carries, the, gun, which, is, dismounted, for, firing, mortars, are, often, carried, this, way, a, mortar, is, sometimes, carried, in, an, armored, vehicle, and, can, either, fire, from, it, or, be, dismounted, to, fire, from, the, ground, since, the, early, 1960s, it, has, been, possible, to, carry, lighter, towed, guns, and, most, mortars, by, helicopter, even, before, that, they, were, parachuted, or, landed, by, glider, from, the, time, of, the, first, airborne, trials, in, the, ussr, in, the, 1930s, in, sp, equipment, the, gun, is, an, integral, part, of, the, vehicle, that, carries, it, sps, first, appeared, during, world, war, i, but, did, not, really, develop, until, world, war, ii, they, are, mostly, tracked, vehicles, but, wheeled, sps, started, to, appear, in, the, 1970s, some, sps, have, no, armor, and, carry, few, or, no, other, weapons, and, ammunition, armored, sps, usually, carry, a, useful, ammunition, load, early, armored, sps, were, mostly, a, casemate, configuration, in, essence, an, open, top, armored, box, offering, only, limited, traverse, however, most, modern, armored, sps, have, a, full, enclosed, armored, turret, usually, giving, full, traverse, for, the, gun, many, sps, cannot, fire, without, deploying, stabilizers, or, spades, sometimes, hydraulic, a, few, sps, are, designed, so, that, the, recoil, forces, of, the, gun, are, transferred, directly, onto, the, ground, through, a, baseplate, a, few, towed, guns, have, been, given, limited, self, propulsion, by, means, of, an, auxiliary, engine, two, other, forms, of, tactical, propulsion, were, used, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, railways, or, transporting, the, equipment, by, road, as, two, or, three, separate, loads, with, disassembly, and, re, assembly, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, the, journey, railway, artillery, took, two, forms, railway, mountings, for, heavy, and, super, heavy, guns, and, howitzers, and, armored, trains, as, fighting, vehicles, armed, with, light, artillery, in, a, direct, fire, role, disassembled, transport, was, also, used, with, heavy, and, super, heavy, weapons, and, lasted, into, the, 1950s, a, third, form, of, artillery, typing, is, to, classify, it, as, light, medium, heavy, and, various, other, terms, it, appears, to, have, been, introduced, in, world, war, i, which, spawned, a, very, wide, array, of, artillery, in, all, sorts, of, sizes, so, a, simple, categorical, system, was, needed, some, armies, defined, these, categories, by, bands, of, calibers, different, bands, were, used, for, different, types, of, weapons, field, guns, mortars, anti, aircraft, guns, and, coastal, guns, list, of, countries, in, order, of, amount, of, artillery, only, conventional, barrel, ordnance, is, given, in, use, with, land, forces, artillery, is, used, in, a, variety, of, roles, depending, on, its, type, and, caliber, the, general, role, of, artillery, is, to, provide, fire, support, the, application, of, fire, coordinated, with, the, manoeuvre, of, forces, to, destroy, neutralize, or, suppress, the, enemy, this, nato, definition, makes, artillery, a, supporting, arm, although, not, all, nato, armies, agree, with, this, logic, the, italicised, terms, are, nato, s, unlike, rockets, guns, or, howitzers, as, some, armies, still, call, them, and, mortars, are, suitable, for, delivering, close, supporting, fire, however, they, are, all, suitable, for, providing, deep, supporting, fire, although, the, limited, range, of, many, mortars, tends, to, exclude, them, from, the, role, their, control, arrangements, and, limited, range, also, mean, that, mortars, are, most, suited, to, direct, supporting, fire, guns, are, used, either, for, this, or, general, supporting, fire, while, rockets, are, mostly, used, for, the, latter, however, lighter, rockets, may, be, used, for, direct, fire, support, these, rules, of, thumb, apply, to, nato, armies, modern, mortars, because, of, their, lighter, weight, and, simpler, more, transportable, design, are, usually, an, integral, part, of, infantry, and, in, some, armies, armour, units, this, means, they, generally, do, not, have, to, concentrate, their, fire, so, their, shorter, range, is, not, a, disadvantage, some, armies, also, consider, infantry, operated, mortars, to, be, more, responsive, than, artillery, but, this, is, a, function, of, the, control, arrangements, and, not, the, case, in, all, armies, however, mortars, have, always, been, used, by, artillery, units, and, remain, with, them, in, many, armies, including, a, few, in, nato, in, nato, armies, artillery, is, usually, assigned, a, tactical, mission, that, establishes, its, relationship, and, responsibilities, to, the, formation, or, units, it, is, assigned, to, it, seems, that, not, all, nato, nations, use, the, terms, and, outside, nato, others, are, probably, used, the, standard, terms, are, direct, support, general, support, general, support, reinforcing, and, reinforcing, these, tactical, missions, are, in, the, context, of, the, command, authority, operational, command, operational, control, tactical, command, or, tactical, control, in, nato, direct, support, generally, means, that, the, directly, supporting, artillery, unit, provides, observers, and, liaison, to, the, manoeuvre, troops, being, supported, typically, an, artillery, battalion, or, equivalent, is, assigned, to, a, brigade, and, its, batteries, to, the, brigade, s, battalions, however, some, armies, achieve, this, by, placing, the, assigned, artillery, units, under, command, of, the, directly, supported, formation, nevertheless, the, batteries, fire, can, be, concentrated, onto, a, single, target, as, can, the, fire, of, units, in, range, and, with, the, other, tactical, missions, there, are, several, dimensions, to, this, subject, the, first, is, the, notion, that, fire, may, be, against, an, opportunity, target, or, may, be, arranged, if, it, is, the, latter, it, may, be, either, on, call, or, scheduled, arranged, targets, may, be, part, of, a, fire, plan, fire, may, be, either, observed, or, unobserved, if, the, former, it, may, be, adjusted, if, the, latter, then, it, has, to, be, predicted, observation, of, adjusted, fire, may, be, directly, by, a, forward, observer, or, indirectly, via, some, other, target, acquisition, system, nato, also, recognises, several, different, types, of, fire, support, for, tactical, purposes, these, purposes, have, existed, for, most, of, the, 20th, century, although, their, definitions, have, evolved, and, will, continue, to, do, so, lack, of, suppression, in, counterbattery, is, an, omission, broadly, they, can, be, defined, as, either, two, other, nato, terms, also, need, definition, the, tactical, purposes, also, include, various, mission, verbs, a, rapidly, expanding, subject, with, the, modern, concept, of, effects, based, operations, targeting, is, the, process, of, selecting, target, and, matching, the, appropriate, response, to, them, taking, account, of, operational, requirements, and, capabilities, it, requires, consideration, of, the, type, of, fire, support, required, and, the, extent, of, coordination, with, the, supported, arm, it, involves, decisions, about, the, targeting, process, is, the, key, aspect, of, tactical, fire, control, depending, on, the, circumstances, and, national, procedures, it, may, all, be, undertaken, in, one, place, or, may, be, distributed, in, armies, practicing, control, from, the, front, most, of, the, process, may, be, undertaken, by, a, forward, observer, or, other, target, acquirer, this, is, particularly, the, case, for, a, smaller, target, requiring, only, a, few, fire, units, the, extent, to, which, the, process, is, formal, or, informal, and, makes, use, of, computer, based, systems, documented, norms, or, experience, and, judgement, also, varies, widely, armies, and, other, circumstances, surprise, may, be, essential, or, irrelevant, it, depends, on, what, effects, are, required, and, whether, or, not, the, target, is, likely, to, move, or, quickly, improve, its, protective, posture, during, world, war, ii, uk, researchers, concluded, that, for, impact, fuzed, munitions, the, relative, risk, were, as, follows, airburst, munitions, significantly, increase, the, relative, risk, for, lying, men, etc, historically, most, casualties, occur, in, the, first, 10, 15, seconds, of, fire, i, e, the, time, needed, to, react, and, improve, protective, posture, however, this, is, less, relevant, if, airburst, is, used, there, are, several, ways, of, making, best, use, of, this, brief, window, of, maximum, vulnerability, modern, counter, battery, fire, developed, in, world, war, i, with, the, objective, of, defeating, the, enemy, s, artillery, typically, such, fire, was, used, to, suppress, enemy, batteries, when, they, were, or, were, about, to, interfere, with, the, activities, of, friendly, forces, such, as, to, prevent, enemy, defensive, artillery, fire, against, an, impending, attack, or, to, systematically, destroy, enemy, guns, in, world, war, i, the, latter, required, air, observation, the, first, indirect, counter, battery, fire, was, in, may, 1900, by, an, observer, in, a, balloon, enemy, artillery, can, be, detected, in, two, ways, either, by, direct, observation, of, the, guns, from, the, air, or, by, ground, observers, including, specialist, reconnaissance, or, from, their, firing, signatures, this, includes, radars, tracking, the, shells, in, flight, to, determine, their, place, of, origin, sound, ranging, detecting, guns, firing, and, resecting, their, position, from, pairs, of, microphones, or, cross, observation, of, gun, flashes, using, observation, by, human, observers, or, opto, electronic, devices, although, the, widespread, adoption, of, flashless, propellant, limited, the, effectiveness, of, the, latter, once, hostile, batteries, have, been, detected, they, may, be, engaged, immediately, by, friendly, artillery, or, later, at, an, optimum, time, depending, on, the, tactical, situation, and, the, counter, battery, policy, air, strike, is, another, option, in, some, situations, the, task, is, to, locate, all, active, enemy, batteries, for, attack, using, a, counter, battery, fire, at, the, appropriate, moment, in, accordance, with, a, plan, developed, by, artillery, intelligence, staff, in, other, situations, counter, battery, fire, may, occur, whenever, a, battery, is, located, with, sufficient, accuracy, modern, counter, battery, target, acquisition, uses, unmanned, aircraft, counter, battery, radar, ground, reconnaissance, and, sound, ranging, counter, battery, fire, may, be, adjusted, by, some, of, the, systems, for, example, the, operator, of, an, unmanned, aircraft, can, follow, a, battery, if, it, moves, defensive, measures, by, batteries, include, frequently, changing, position, or, constructing, defensive, earthworks, the, tunnels, used, by, north, korea, being, an, extreme, example, counter, measures, include, air, defence, against, aircraft, and, attacking, counter, battery, radars, physically, and, electronically, field, artillery, team, is, a, us, term, and, the, following, description, and, terminology, applies, to, the, us, other, armies, are, broadly, similar, but, differ, in, significant, details, modern, field, artillery, post, world, war, i, has, three, distinct, parts, the, forward, observer, fo, the, fire, direction, center, fdc, and, the, actual, guns, themselves, the, forward, observer, observes, the, target, using, tools, such, as, binoculars, laser, rangefinders, designators, and, call, back, fire, missions, on, his, radio, or, relays, the, data, through, a, portable, computer, via, an, encrypted, digital, radio, connection, protected, from, jamming, by, computerized, frequency, hopping, a, lesser, known, part, of, the, team, is, the, fas, or, field, artillery, survey, team, which, sets, up, the, gun, line, for, the, cannons, today, most, artillery, battalions, use, an, aiming, circle, which, allows, for, faster, setup, and, more, mobility, fas, teams, are, still, used, for, checks, and, balances, purposes, and, if, a, gun, battery, has, issues, with, the, aiming, circle, a, fas, team, will, do, it, for, them, the, fo, can, communicate, directly, with, the, battery, fdc, of, which, there, is, one, per, each, battery, of, 4, 8, guns, otherwise, the, several, fos, communicate, with, a, higher, fdc, such, as, at, a, battalion, level, and, the, higher, fdc, prioritizes, the, targets, and, allocates, fires, to, individual, batteries, as, needed, to, engage, the, targets, that, are, spotted, by, the, fos, or, to, perform, preplanned, fires, the, battery, fdc, computes, firing, data, ammunition, to, be, used, powder, charge, fuse, settings, the, direction, to, the, target, and, the, quadrant, elevation, to, be, fired, at, to, reach, the, target, what, gun, will, fire, any, rounds, needed, for, adjusting, on, the, target, and, the, number, of, rounds, to, be, fired, on, the, target, by, each, gun, once, the, target, has, been, accurately, located, to, the, guns, traditionally, this, data, is, relayed, via, radio, or, wire, communications, as, a, warning, order, to, the, guns, followed, by, orders, specifying, the, type, of, ammunition, and, fuse, setting, direction, and, the, elevation, needed, to, reach, the, target, and, the, method, of, adjustment, or, orders, for, fire, for, effect, ffe, however, in, more, advanced, artillery, units, this, data, is, relayed, through, a, digital, radio, link, other, parts, of, the, field, artillery, team, include, meteorological, analysis, to, determine, the, temperature, humidity, and, pressure, of, the, air, and, wind, direction, and, speed, at, different, altitudes, also, radar, is, used, both, for, determining, the, location, of, enemy, artillery, and, mortar, batteries, and, to, determine, the, precise, actual, strike, points, of, rounds, fired, by, battery, and, comparing, that, location, with, what, was, expected, to, compute, a, registration, allowing, future, rounds, to, be, fired, with, much, greater, accuracy, a, technique, called, time, on, target, tot, was, developed, by, the, british, army, in, north, africa, at, the, end, of, 1941, and, early, 1942, particularly, for, counter, battery, fire, and, other, concentrations, it, proved, very, popular, it, relied, on, bbc, time, signals, to, enable, officers, to, synchronize, their, watches, to, the, second, because, this, avoided, the, need, to, use, military, radio, networks, and, the, possibility, of, losing, surprise, and, the, need, for, field, telephone, networks, in, the, desert, with, this, technique, the, time, of, flight, from, each, fire, unit, battery, or, troop, to, the, target, is, taken, from, the, range, or, firing, tables, or, the, computer, and, each, engaging, fire, unit, subtracts, its, time, of, flight, from, the, tot, to, determine, the, time, to, fire, an, executive, order, to, fire, is, given, to, all, guns, in, the, fire, unit, at, the, correct, moment, to, fire, when, each, fire, unit, fires, their, rounds, at, their, individual, firing, time, all, the, opening, rounds, will, reach, the, target, area, almost, simultaneously, this, is, especially, effective, when, combined, with, techniques, that, allow, fires, for, effect, to, be, made, without, preliminary, adjusting, fires, multiple, round, simultaneous, impact, mrsi, is, a, modern, version, of, the, earlier, time, on, target, concept, mrsi, is, when, a, single, gun, fires, multiple, shells, so, all, arrive, at, the, same, target, simultaneously, this, is, possible, because, there, is, more, than, one, trajectory, for, a, round, to, fly, to, any, given, target, typically, one, is, below, 45, degrees, from, horizontal, and, the, other, is, above, it, and, by, using, different, sized, propellant, charges, with, each, shell, it, is, possible, to, utilize, more, than, two, trajectories, because, the, higher, trajectories, cause, the, shells, to, arc, higher, into, the, air, they, take, longer, to, reach, the, target, if, shells, are, fired, on, higher, trajectories, for, initial, volleys, starting, with, the, shell, with, the, most, propellant, and, working, down, and, later, volleys, are, fired, on, the, lower, trajectories, with, the, correct, timing, the, shells, will, all, arrive, at, the, same, target, simultaneously, this, is, useful, because, many, more, shells, can, land, on, the, target, with, no, warning, with, traditional, methods, of, firing, the, target, area, may, have, time, however, long, it, takes, to, reload, and, re, fire, the, guns, to, take, cover, between, volleys, however, guns, capable, of, burst, fire, can, deliver, multiple, rounds, in, a, few, seconds, if, they, use, the, same, firing, data, for, each, and, if, guns, in, more, than, one, location, are, firing, on, one, target, they, can, use, time, on, target, procedures, so, that, all, their, shells, arrive, at, the, same, time, and, target, mrsi, has, a, few, prerequisites, the, first, is, guns, with, a, high, rate, of, fire, the, second, is, the, ability, to, use, different, sized, propellant, charges, third, is, a, fire, control, computer, that, has, the, ability, to, compute, mrsi, volleys, and, the, capability, to, produce, firing, data, sent, to, each, gun, and, then, presented, to, the, gun, commander, in, the, correct, order, the, number, of, rounds, that, can, be, delivered, in, mrsi, depends, primarily, on, the, range, to, the, target, and, the, rate, of, fire, to, allow, the, most, shells, to, reach, the, target, the, target, has, to, be, in, range, of, the, lowest, propellant, charge, examples, of, guns, with, a, rate, of, fire, that, makes, them, suitable, for, mrsi, includes, uk, s, as, 90, south, africa, s, denel, g6, 52, which, can, land, six, rounds, simultaneously, at, targets, at, least, 25, km, 16, mi, away, germany, s, panzerhaubitze, 2000, which, can, land, five, rounds, simultaneously, at, targets, at, least, 17, km, 11, mi, away, slovakia, s, 155, mm, spgh, zuzana, model, 2000, and, k9, thunder, the, archer, project, developed, by, bae, systems, bofors, in, sweden, is, a, 155, mm, howitzer, on, a, wheeled, chassis, which, is, claimed, to, be, able, to, deliver, up, to, six, shells, on, target, simultaneously, from, the, same, gun, the, 120, mm, twin, barrel, amos, mortar, system, joint, developed, by, h, gglunds, sweden, and, patria, finland, is, capable, of, 7, 7, shells, mrsi, the, united, states, crusader, program, now, cancelled, was, slated, to, have, mrsi, capability, it, is, unclear, how, many, fire, control, computers, have, the, necessary, capabilities, two, round, mrsi, firings, were, a, popular, artillery, demonstration, in, the, 1960s, where, well, trained, detachments, could, show, off, their, skills, for, spectators, the, destructiveness, of, artillery, bombardments, can, be, enhanced, when, some, or, all, of, the, shells, are, set, for, airburst, meaning, that, they, explode, in, the, air, above, the, target, instead, of, upon, impact, this, can, be, accomplished, either, through, time, fuzes, or, proximity, fuzes, time, fuzes, use, a, precise, timer, to, detonate, the, shell, after, a, preset, delay, this, technique, is, tricky, and, slight, variations, in, the, functioning, of, the, fuze, can, cause, it, to, explode, too, high, and, be, ineffective, or, to, strike, the, ground, instead, of, exploding, above, it, since, december, 1944, battle, of, the, bulge, proximity, fuzed, artillery, shells, have, been, available, that, take, the, guesswork, out, of, this, process, these, employ, a, miniature, low, powered, radar, transmitter, in, the, fuze, to, detect, the, ground, and, explode, them, at, a, predetermined, height, above, it, the, return, of, the, weak, radar, signal, completes, an, electrical, circuit, in, the, fuze, which, explodes, the, shell, the, proximity, fuze, itself, was, developed, by, the, british, to, increase, the, effectiveness, of, anti, aircraft, warfare, this, is, a, very, effective, tactic, against, infantry, and, light, vehicles, because, it, scatters, the, fragmentation, of, the, shell, over, a, larger, area, and, prevents, it, from, being, blocked, by, terrain, or, entrenchments, that, do, not, include, some, form, of, robust, overhead, cover, combined, with, tot, or, mrsi, tactics, that, give, no, warning, of, the, incoming, rounds, these, rounds, are, especially, devastating, because, many, enemy, soldiers, are, likely, to, be, caught, in, the, open, even, more, so, if, the, attack, is, launched, against, an, assembly, area, or, troops, moving, in, the, open, rather, than, a, unit, in, an, entrenched, tactical, position, numerous, war, memorials, around, the, world, incorporate, an, artillery, piece, that, was, used, in, the, war, or, battle, commemorated
