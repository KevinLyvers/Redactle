data, storage, is, the, recording, storing, of, information, data, in, a, storage, medium, handwriting, phonographic, recording, magnetic, tape, and, optical, discs, are, all, examples, of, storage, media, biological, molecules, such, as, rna, and, dna, are, considered, by, some, as, data, storage, recording, may, be, accomplished, with, virtually, any, form, of, energy, electronic, data, storage, requires, electrical, power, to, store, and, retrieve, data, data, storage, in, a, digital, machine, readable, medium, is, sometimes, called, digital, data, computer, data, storage, is, one, of, the, core, functions, of, a, general, purpose, computer, electronic, documents, can, be, stored, in, much, less, space, than, paper, documents, barcodes, and, magnetic, ink, character, recognition, micr, are, two, ways, of, recording, machine, readable, data, on, paper, a, recording, medium, is, a, physical, material, that, holds, information, newly, created, information, is, distributed, and, can, be, stored, in, four, storage, media, print, film, magnetic, and, optical, and, seen, or, heard, in, four, information, flows, telephone, radio, and, tv, and, the, internet, as, well, as, being, observed, directly, digital, information, is, stored, on, electronic, media, in, many, different, recording, formats, with, electronic, media, the, data, and, the, recording, media, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, software, despite, the, more, common, use, of, the, word, to, describe, computer, software, with, traditional, art, static, media, art, materials, such, as, crayons, may, be, considered, both, equipment, and, medium, as, the, wax, charcoal, or, chalk, material, from, the, equipment, becomes, part, of, the, surface, of, the, medium, some, recording, media, may, be, temporary, either, by, design, or, by, nature, volatile, organic, compounds, may, be, used, to, preserve, the, environment, or, to, purposely, make, data, expire, over, time, data, such, as, smoke, signals, or, skywriting, are, temporary, by, nature, depending, on, the, volatility, a, gas, e, g, atmosphere, smoke, or, a, liquid, surface, such, as, a, lake, would, be, considered, a, temporary, recording, medium, if, at, all, a, 2003, uc, berkeley, report, estimated, that, about, five, exabytes, of, new, information, were, produced, in, 2002, and, that, 92, of, this, data, was, stored, on, hard, disk, drives, this, was, about, twice, the, data, produced, in, 2000, the, amount, of, data, transmitted, over, telecommunications, systems, in, 2002, was, nearly, 18, exabytes, three, and, a, half, times, more, than, was, recorded, on, non, volatile, storage, telephone, calls, constituted, 98, of, the, telecommunicated, information, in, 2002, the, researchers, highest, estimate, for, the, growth, rate, of, newly, stored, information, uncompressed, was, more, than, 30, per, year, in, a, more, limited, study, the, international, data, corporation, estimated, that, the, total, amount, of, digital, data, in, 2007, was, 281, exabytes, and, that, the, total, amount, of, digital, data, produced, exceeded, the, global, storage, capacity, for, the, first, time, a, 2011, science, magazine, article, estimated, that, the, year, 2002, was, the, beginning, of, the, digital, age, for, information, storage, an, age, in, which, more, information, is, stored, on, digital, storage, devices, than, on, analog, storage, devices, in, 1986, approximately, 1, of, the, world, s, capacity, to, store, information, was, in, digital, format, this, grew, to, 3, by, 1993, to, 25, by, 2000, and, to, 97, by, 2007, these, figures, correspond, to, less, than, three, compressed, exabytes, in, 1986, and, 295, compressed, exabytes, in, 2007, the, quantity, of, digital, storage, doubled, roughly, every, three, years, it, is, estimated, that, around, 120, zettabytes, of, data, will, be, generated, in, 2023, an, increase, of, 60x, from, 2010, and, that, it, will, increase, to, 181, zettabytes, generated, in, 2025
