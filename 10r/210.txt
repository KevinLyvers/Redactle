a, power, station, also, referred, to, as, a, power, plant, and, sometimes, generating, station, or, generating, plant, is, an, industrial, facility, for, the, generation, of, electric, power, power, stations, are, generally, connected, to, an, electrical, grid, many, power, stations, contain, one, or, more, generators, rotating, machine, that, converts, mechanical, power, into, three, phase, electric, power, the, relative, motion, between, a, magnetic, field, and, a, conductor, creates, an, electric, current, the, energy, source, harnessed, to, turn, the, generator, varies, widely, most, power, stations, in, the, world, burn, fossil, fuels, such, as, coal, oil, and, natural, gas, to, generate, electricity, low, carbon, power, sources, include, nuclear, power, and, use, of, renewables, such, as, solar, wind, geothermal, and, hydroelectric, in, early, 1871, belgian, inventor, z, nobe, gramme, invented, a, generator, powerful, enough, to, produce, power, on, a, commercial, scale, for, industry, in, 1878, a, hydroelectric, power, station, was, designed, and, built, by, william, lord, armstrong, at, cragside, england, it, used, water, from, lakes, on, his, estate, to, power, siemens, dynamos, the, electricity, supplied, power, to, lights, heating, produced, hot, water, ran, an, elevator, as, well, as, labor, saving, devices, and, farm, buildings, in, january, 1882, the, world, s, first, public, coal, fired, power, station, the, edison, electric, light, station, was, built, in, london, a, project, of, thomas, edison, organized, by, edward, johnson, a, babcock, wilcox, boiler, powered, a, 93, kw, 125, horsepower, steam, engine, that, drove, a, 27, tonne, 27, long, ton, generator, this, supplied, electricity, to, premises, in, the, area, that, could, be, reached, through, the, culverts, of, the, viaduct, without, digging, up, the, road, which, was, the, monopoly, of, the, gas, companies, the, customers, included, the, city, temple, and, the, old, bailey, another, important, customer, was, the, telegraph, office, of, the, general, post, office, but, this, could, not, be, reached, through, the, culverts, johnson, arranged, for, the, supply, cable, to, be, run, overhead, via, holborn, tavern, and, newgate, in, september, 1882, in, new, york, the, pearl, street, station, was, established, by, edison, to, provide, electric, lighting, in, the, lower, manhattan, island, area, the, station, ran, until, destroyed, by, fire, in, 1890, the, station, used, reciprocating, steam, engines, to, turn, direct, current, generators, because, of, the, dc, distribution, the, service, area, was, small, limited, by, voltage, drop, in, the, feeders, in, 1886, george, westinghouse, began, building, an, alternating, current, system, that, used, a, transformer, to, step, up, voltage, for, long, distance, transmission, and, then, stepped, it, back, down, for, indoor, lighting, a, more, efficient, and, less, expensive, system, which, is, similar, to, modern, systems, the, war, of, the, currents, eventually, resolved, in, favor, of, ac, distribution, and, utilization, although, some, dc, systems, persisted, to, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, dc, systems, with, a, service, radius, of, a, mile, kilometer, or, so, were, necessarily, smaller, less, efficient, of, fuel, consumption, and, more, labor, intensive, to, operate, than, much, larger, central, ac, generating, stations, ac, systems, used, a, wide, range, of, frequencies, depending, on, the, type, of, load, lighting, load, using, higher, frequencies, and, traction, systems, and, heavy, motor, load, systems, preferring, lower, frequencies, the, economics, of, central, station, generation, improved, greatly, when, unified, light, and, power, systems, operating, at, a, common, frequency, were, developed, the, same, generating, plant, that, fed, large, industrial, loads, during, the, day, could, feed, commuter, railway, systems, during, rush, hour, and, then, serve, lighting, load, in, the, evening, thus, improving, the, system, load, factor, and, reducing, the, cost, of, electrical, energy, overall, many, exceptions, existed, generating, stations, were, dedicated, to, power, or, light, by, the, choice, of, frequency, and, rotating, frequency, changers, and, rotating, converters, were, particularly, common, to, feed, electric, railway, systems, from, the, general, lighting, and, power, network, throughout, the, first, few, decades, of, the, 20th, century, central, stations, became, larger, using, higher, steam, pressures, to, provide, greater, efficiency, and, relying, on, interconnections, of, multiple, generating, stations, to, improve, reliability, and, cost, high, voltage, ac, transmission, allowed, hydroelectric, power, to, be, conveniently, moved, from, distant, waterfalls, to, city, markets, the, advent, of, the, steam, turbine, in, central, station, service, around, 1906, allowed, great, expansion, of, generating, capacity, generators, were, no, longer, limited, by, the, power, transmission, of, belts, or, the, relatively, slow, speed, of, reciprocating, engines, and, could, grow, to, enormous, sizes, for, example, sebastian, ziani, de, ferranti, planned, what, would, have, reciprocating, steam, engine, ever, built, for, a, proposed, new, central, station, but, scrapped, the, plans, when, turbines, became, available, in, the, necessary, size, building, power, systems, out, of, central, stations, required, combinations, of, engineering, skill, and, financial, acumen, in, equal, measure, pioneers, of, central, station, generation, include, george, westinghouse, and, samuel, insull, in, the, united, states, ferranti, and, charles, hesterman, merz, in, uk, and, many, others, 2021, world, electricity, generation, by, source, total, generation, was, 28, petawatt, hours, in, thermal, power, stations, mechanical, power, is, produced, by, a, heat, engine, that, transforms, thermal, energy, often, from, combustion, of, a, fuel, into, rotational, energy, most, thermal, power, stations, produce, steam, so, they, are, sometimes, called, steam, power, stations, not, all, thermal, energy, can, be, transformed, into, mechanical, power, according, to, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, therefore, there, is, always, heat, lost, to, the, environment, if, this, loss, is, employed, as, useful, heat, for, industrial, processes, or, district, heating, the, power, plant, is, referred, to, as, a, cogeneration, power, plant, or, chp, combined, heat, and, power, plant, in, countries, where, district, heating, is, common, there, are, dedicated, heat, plants, called, heat, only, boiler, stations, an, important, class, of, power, stations, in, the, middle, east, uses, by, product, heat, for, the, desalination, of, water, the, efficiency, of, a, thermal, power, cycle, is, limited, by, the, maximum, working, fluid, temperature, produced, the, efficiency, is, not, directly, a, function, of, the, fuel, used, for, the, same, steam, conditions, coal, nuclear, and, gas, power, plants, all, have, the, same, theoretical, efficiency, overall, if, a, system, is, on, constantly, base, load, it, will, be, more, efficient, than, one, that, is, used, intermittently, peak, load, steam, turbines, generally, operate, at, higher, efficiency, when, operated, at, full, capacity, besides, use, of, reject, heat, for, process, or, district, heating, one, way, to, improve, overall, efficiency, of, a, power, plant, is, to, combine, two, different, thermodynamic, cycles, in, a, combined, cycle, plant, most, commonly, exhaust, gases, from, a, gas, turbine, are, used, to, generate, steam, for, a, boiler, and, a, steam, turbine, the, combination, of, a, top, cycle, and, a, bottom, cycle, produces, higher, overall, efficiency, than, either, cycle, can, attain, alone, in, 2018, inter, rao, ues, and, state, grid, archived, 21, december, 2021, at, the, wayback, machine, planned, to, build, an, 8, gw, thermal, power, plant, which, s, the, largest, coal, fired, power, plant, construction, project, in, russia, a, prime, mover, is, a, machine, that, converts, energy, of, various, forms, into, energy, of, motion, power, plants, that, can, be, dispatched, scheduled, to, provide, energy, to, a, system, include, non, dispatchable, plants, include, such, sources, as, wind, and, solar, energy, while, their, long, term, contribution, to, system, energy, supply, is, predictable, on, a, short, term, daily, or, hourly, base, their, energy, must, be, used, as, available, since, generation, cannot, be, deferred, contractual, arrangements, take, or, pay, with, independent, power, producers, or, system, interconnections, to, other, networks, may, be, effectively, non, dispatchable, all, thermal, power, plants, produce, waste, heat, energy, as, a, byproduct, of, the, useful, electrical, energy, produced, the, amount, of, waste, heat, energy, equals, or, exceeds, the, amount, of, energy, converted, into, useful, electricity, gas, fired, power, plants, can, achieve, as, much, as, 65, conversion, efficiency, while, coal, and, oil, plants, achieve, around, 30, 49, the, waste, heat, produces, a, temperature, rise, in, the, atmosphere, which, is, small, compared, to, that, produced, by, greenhouse, gas, emissions, from, the, same, power, plant, natural, draft, wet, cooling, towers, at, many, nuclear, power, plants, and, large, fossil, fuel, fired, power, plants, use, large, hyperboloid, chimney, like, structures, as, seen, in, the, image, at, the, right, that, release, the, waste, heat, to, the, ambient, atmosphere, by, the, evaporation, of, water, however, the, mechanical, induced, draft, or, forced, draft, wet, cooling, towers, in, many, large, thermal, power, plants, nuclear, power, plants, fossil, fired, power, plants, petroleum, refineries, petrochemical, plants, geothermal, biomass, and, waste, to, energy, plants, use, fans, to, provide, air, movement, upward, through, down, coming, water, and, are, not, hyperboloid, chimney, like, structures, the, induced, or, forced, draft, cooling, towers, are, typically, rectangular, box, like, structures, filled, with, a, material, that, enhances, the, mixing, of, the, upflowing, air, and, the, down, flowing, water, in, areas, with, restricted, water, use, a, dry, cooling, tower, or, directly, air, cooled, radiators, may, be, necessary, since, the, cost, or, environmental, consequences, of, obtaining, make, up, water, for, evaporative, cooling, would, be, prohibitive, these, coolers, have, lower, efficiency, and, higher, energy, consumption, to, drive, fans, compared, to, a, typical, wet, evaporative, cooling, tower, power, plants, can, use, an, air, cooled, condenser, traditionally, in, areas, with, a, limited, or, expensive, water, supply, air, cooled, condensers, serve, the, same, purpose, as, a, cooling, tower, heat, dissipation, without, using, water, they, consume, additional, auxiliary, power, and, thus, may, have, a, higher, carbon, footprint, compared, to, a, traditional, cooling, tower, electric, companies, often, prefer, to, use, cooling, water, from, the, ocean, or, a, lake, river, or, cooling, pond, instead, of, a, cooling, tower, this, single, pass, or, once, through, cooling, system, can, save, the, cost, of, a, cooling, tower, and, may, have, lower, energy, costs, for, pumping, cooling, water, through, the, plant, s, heat, exchangers, however, the, waste, heat, can, cause, thermal, pollution, as, the, water, is, discharged, power, plants, using, natural, bodies, of, water, for, cooling, are, designed, with, mechanisms, such, as, fish, screens, to, limit, intake, of, organisms, into, the, cooling, machinery, these, screens, are, only, partially, effective, and, as, a, result, billions, of, fish, and, other, aquatic, organisms, are, killed, by, power, plants, each, year, for, example, the, cooling, system, at, the, indian, point, energy, center, in, new, york, kills, over, a, billion, fish, eggs, and, larvae, annually, a, further, environmental, impact, is, that, aquatic, organisms, which, adapt, to, the, warmer, discharge, water, may, be, injured, if, the, plant, shuts, down, in, cold, weather, water, consumption, by, power, stations, is, a, developing, issue, in, recent, years, recycled, wastewater, or, grey, water, has, been, used, in, cooling, towers, the, calpine, riverside, and, the, calpine, fox, power, stations, in, wisconsin, as, well, as, the, calpine, mankato, power, station, in, minnesota, are, among, these, facilities, power, stations, can, generate, electrical, energy, from, renewable, energy, sources, in, a, hydroelectric, power, station, water, flows, through, turbines, using, hydropower, to, generate, hydroelectricity, power, is, captured, from, the, gravitational, force, of, water, falling, through, penstocks, to, water, turbines, connected, to, generators, the, amount, of, power, available, is, a, combination, of, height, and, water, flow, a, wide, range, of, dams, may, be, built, to, raise, the, water, level, and, create, a, lake, for, storing, water, hydropower, is, produced, in, 150, countries, with, the, asia, pacific, region, generating, 32, percent, of, global, hydropower, in, 2010, china, is, the, largest, hydroelectricity, producer, with, 721, terawatt, hours, of, production, in, 2010, representing, around, 17, percent, of, domestic, electricity, use, solar, energy, can, be, turned, into, electricity, either, directly, in, solar, cells, or, in, a, concentrating, solar, power, plant, by, focusing, the, light, to, run, a, heat, engine, a, solar, photovoltaic, power, plant, converts, sunlight, into, direct, current, electricity, using, the, photoelectric, effect, inverters, change, the, direct, current, into, alternating, current, for, connection, to, the, electrical, grid, this, type, of, plant, does, not, use, rotating, machines, for, energy, conversion, solar, thermal, power, plants, use, either, parabolic, troughs, or, heliostats, to, direct, sunlight, onto, a, pipe, containing, a, heat, transfer, fluid, such, as, oil, the, heated, oil, is, then, used, to, boil, water, into, steam, which, turns, a, turbine, that, drives, an, electrical, generator, the, central, tower, type, of, solar, thermal, power, plant, uses, hundreds, or, thousands, of, mirrors, depending, on, size, to, direct, sunlight, onto, a, receiver, on, top, of, a, tower, the, heat, is, used, to, produce, steam, to, turn, turbines, that, drive, electrical, generators, wind, turbines, can, be, used, to, generate, electricity, in, areas, with, strong, steady, winds, sometimes, offshore, many, different, designs, have, been, used, in, the, past, but, almost, all, modern, turbines, being, produced, today, use, a, three, bladed, upwind, design, grid, connected, wind, turbines, now, being, built, are, much, larger, than, the, units, installed, during, the, 1970s, they, thus, produce, power, more, cheaply, and, reliably, than, earlier, models, with, larger, turbines, on, the, order, of, one, megawatt, the, blades, move, more, slowly, than, older, smaller, units, which, makes, them, less, visually, distracting, and, safer, for, birds, marine, energy, or, marine, power, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, ocean, energy, or, ocean, power, refers, to, the, energy, carried, by, ocean, waves, tides, salinity, and, ocean, temperature, differences, the, movement, of, water, in, the, world, s, oceans, creates, a, vast, store, of, kinetic, energy, or, energy, in, motion, this, energy, can, be, harnessed, to, generate, electricity, to, power, homes, transport, and, industries, the, term, marine, energy, encompasses, both, wave, power, power, from, surface, waves, and, tidal, power, obtained, from, the, kinetic, energy, of, large, bodies, of, moving, water, offshore, wind, power, is, not, a, form, of, marine, energy, as, wind, power, is, derived, from, the, wind, even, if, the, wind, turbines, are, placed, over, water, the, oceans, have, a, tremendous, amount, of, energy, and, are, close, to, many, if, not, most, concentrated, populations, ocean, energy, has, the, potential, of, providing, a, substantial, amount, of, new, renewable, energy, around, the, world, salinity, gradient, energy, is, called, pressure, retarded, osmosis, in, this, method, seawater, is, pumped, into, a, pressure, chamber, that, is, at, a, pressure, lower, than, the, difference, between, the, pressures, of, saline, water, and, fresh, water, freshwater, is, also, pumped, into, the, pressure, chamber, through, a, membrane, which, increases, both, the, volume, and, pressure, of, the, chamber, as, the, pressure, differences, are, compensated, a, turbine, is, spun, creating, energy, this, method, is, being, specifically, studied, by, the, norwegian, utility, statkraft, which, has, calculated, that, up, to, 25, twh, yr, would, be, available, from, this, process, in, norway, statkraft, has, built, the, world, s, first, prototype, osmotic, power, plant, on, the, oslo, fjord, which, was, opened, on, 24, november, 2009, in, january, 2014, however, statkraft, announced, not, to, continue, this, pilot, biomass, energy, can, be, produced, from, combustion, of, waste, green, material, to, heat, water, into, steam, and, drive, a, steam, turbine, bioenergy, can, also, be, processed, through, a, range, of, temperatures, and, pressures, in, gasification, pyrolysis, or, torrefaction, reactions, depending, on, the, desired, end, product, these, reactions, create, more, energy, dense, products, syngas, wood, pellets, biocoal, that, can, then, be, fed, into, an, accompanying, engine, to, produce, electricity, at, a, much, lower, emission, rate, when, compared, with, open, burning, it, is, possible, to, store, energy, and, produce, electrical, power, at, a, later, time, as, in, pumped, storage, hydroelectricity, thermal, energy, storage, flywheel, energy, storage, battery, storage, power, station, and, so, on, the, world, s, largest, form, of, storage, for, excess, electricity, pumped, storage, is, a, reversible, hydroelectric, plant, they, are, a, net, consumer, of, energy, but, provide, storage, for, any, source, of, electricity, effectively, smoothing, peaks, and, troughs, in, electricity, supply, and, demand, pumped, storage, plants, typically, use, spare, electricity, during, off, peak, periods, to, pump, water, from, a, lower, reservoir, to, an, upper, reservoir, because, the, pumping, takes, place, off, peak, electricity, is, less, valuable, than, at, peak, times, this, less, valuable, spare, electricity, comes, from, uncontrolled, wind, power, and, base, load, power, plants, such, as, coal, nuclear, and, geothermal, which, still, produce, power, at, night, even, though, demand, is, very, low, during, daytime, peak, demand, when, electricity, prices, are, high, the, storage, is, used, for, peaking, power, where, water, in, the, upper, reservoir, is, allowed, to, flow, back, to, a, lower, reservoir, through, a, turbine, and, generator, unlike, coal, power, stations, which, can, take, more, than, 12, hours, to, start, up, from, cold, a, hydroelectric, generator, can, be, brought, into, service, in, a, few, minutes, ideal, to, meet, a, peak, load, demand, two, substantial, pumped, storage, schemes, are, in, south, africa, palmiet, pumped, storage, scheme, and, another, in, the, drakensberg, ingula, pumped, storage, scheme, the, power, generated, by, a, power, station, is, measured, in, multiples, of, the, watt, typically, megawatts, 10, 6, watts, or, gigawatts, 10, 9, watts, power, stations, vary, greatly, in, capacity, depending, on, the, type, of, power, plant, and, on, historical, geographical, and, economic, factors, the, following, examples, offer, a, sense, of, the, scale, many, of, the, largest, operational, onshore, wind, farms, are, located, in, china, as, of, 2022, the, roscoe, wind, farm, is, the, largest, onshore, wind, farm, in, the, world, producing, 8000, mw, of, power, followed, by, the, zhang, jiakou, 3000, mw, as, of, january, 2022, the, hornsea, wind, farm, in, united, kingdom, is, the, largest, offshore, wind, farm, in, the, world, at, 1218, mw, followed, by, walney, wind, farm, in, united, kingdom, at, 1026, mw, in, 2021, the, worldwide, installed, capacity, of, power, plants, increased, by, 347, gw, solar, and, wind, power, plant, capacities, rose, by, 80, in, one, year, as, of, 2022, the, largest, photovoltaic, pv, power, plants, in, the, world, are, led, by, bhadla, solar, park, in, india, rated, at, 2245, mw, solar, thermal, power, stations, in, the, u, s, have, the, following, output, large, coal, fired, nuclear, and, hydroelectric, power, stations, can, generate, hundreds, of, megawatts, to, multiple, gigawatts, some, examples, gas, turbine, power, plants, can, generate, tens, to, hundreds, of, megawatts, some, examples, the, rated, capacity, of, a, power, station, is, nearly, the, maximum, electrical, power, that, the, power, station, can, produce, some, power, plants, are, run, at, almost, exactly, their, rated, capacity, all, the, time, as, a, non, load, following, base, load, power, plant, except, at, times, of, scheduled, or, unscheduled, maintenance, however, many, power, plants, usually, produce, much, less, power, than, their, rated, capacity, in, some, cases, a, power, plant, produces, much, less, power, than, its, rated, capacity, because, it, uses, an, intermittent, energy, source, operators, try, to, pull, maximum, available, power, from, such, power, plants, because, their, marginal, cost, is, practically, zero, but, the, available, power, varies, widely, in, particular, it, may, be, zero, during, heavy, storms, at, night, in, some, cases, operators, deliberately, produce, less, power, for, economic, reasons, the, cost, of, fuel, to, run, a, load, following, power, plant, may, be, relatively, high, and, the, cost, of, fuel, to, run, a, peaking, power, plant, is, even, higher, they, have, relatively, high, marginal, costs, operators, keep, power, plants, turned, off, operational, reserve, or, running, at, minimum, fuel, consumption, spinning, reserve, most, of, the, time, operators, feed, more, fuel, into, load, following, power, plants, only, when, the, demand, rises, above, what, lower, cost, plants, i, e, intermittent, and, base, load, plants, can, produce, and, then, feed, more, fuel, into, peaking, power, plants, only, when, the, demand, rises, faster, than, the, load, following, power, plants, can, follow, not, all, of, the, generated, power, of, a, plant, is, necessarily, delivered, into, a, distribution, system, power, plants, typically, also, use, some, of, the, power, themselves, in, which, case, the, generation, output, is, classified, into, gross, generation, and, net, generation, gross, generation, or, gross, electric, output, is, the, total, amount, of, electricity, generated, by, a, power, plant, over, a, specific, period, of, time, it, is, measured, at, the, generating, terminal, and, is, measured, in, kilowatt, hours, kw, h, megawatt, hours, mw, h, gigawatt, hours, gw, h, or, for, the, largest, power, plants, terawatt, hours, tw, h, it, includes, the, electricity, used, in, the, plant, auxiliaries, and, in, the, transformers, net, generation, is, the, amount, of, electricity, generated, by, a, power, plant, that, is, transmitted, and, distributed, for, consumer, use, net, generation, is, less, than, the, total, gross, power, generation, as, some, power, produced, is, consumed, within, the, plant, itself, to, power, auxiliary, equipment, such, as, pumps, motors, and, pollution, control, devices, thus, operating, staff, at, a, power, station, have, several, duties, operators, are, responsible, for, the, safety, of, the, work, crews, that, frequently, do, repairs, on, the, mechanical, and, electrical, equipment, they, maintain, the, equipment, with, periodic, inspections, and, log, temperatures, pressures, and, other, important, information, at, regular, intervals, operators, are, responsible, for, starting, and, stopping, the, generators, depending, on, need, they, are, able, to, synchronize, and, adjust, the, voltage, output, of, the, added, generation, with, the, running, electrical, system, without, upsetting, the, system, they, must, know, the, electrical, and, mechanical, systems, to, troubleshoot, problems, in, the, facility, and, add, to, the, reliability, of, the, facility, operators, must, be, able, to, respond, to, an, emergency, and, know, the, procedures, in, place, to, deal, with, it
