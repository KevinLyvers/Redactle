electric, power, distribution, is, the, final, stage, in, the, delivery, of, electricity, electricity, is, carried, from, the, transmission, system, to, individual, consumers, distribution, substations, connect, to, the, transmission, system, and, lower, the, transmission, voltage, to, medium, voltage, ranging, between, 2, kv, and, 33, kv, with, the, use, of, transformers, primary, distribution, lines, carry, this, medium, voltage, power, to, distribution, transformers, located, near, the, customer, s, premises, distribution, transformers, again, lower, the, voltage, to, the, utilization, voltage, used, by, lighting, industrial, equipment, and, household, appliances, often, several, customers, are, supplied, from, one, transformer, through, secondary, distribution, lines, commercial, and, residential, customers, are, connected, to, the, secondary, distribution, lines, through, service, drops, customers, demanding, a, much, larger, amount, of, power, may, be, connected, directly, to, the, primary, distribution, level, or, the, subtransmission, level, the, transition, from, transmission, to, distribution, happens, in, a, power, substation, which, has, the, following, functions, urban, distribution, is, mainly, underground, sometimes, in, common, utility, ducts, rural, distribution, is, mostly, above, ground, with, utility, poles, and, suburban, distribution, is, a, mix, closer, to, the, customer, a, distribution, transformer, steps, the, primary, distribution, power, down, to, a, low, voltage, secondary, circuit, usually, 120, 240, v, in, the, us, for, residential, customers, the, power, comes, to, the, customer, via, a, service, drop, and, an, electricity, meter, the, final, circuit, in, an, urban, system, may, be, less, than, 15, metres, 50, ft, but, may, be, over, 91, metres, 300, ft, for, a, rural, customer, electric, power, distribution, become, necessary, only, in, the, 1880s, when, electricity, started, being, generated, at, power, stations, until, then, electricity, was, usually, generated, where, it, was, used, the, first, power, distribution, systems, installed, in, european, and, us, cities, were, used, to, supply, lighting, arc, lighting, running, on, very, high, voltage, around, 3, 000, v, alternating, current, ac, or, direct, current, dc, and, incandescent, lighting, running, on, low, voltage, 100, v, direct, current, both, were, supplanting, gas, lighting, systems, with, arc, lighting, taking, over, large, area, and, street, lighting, and, incandescent, lighting, replacing, gas, lights, for, business, and, residential, users, the, high, voltages, used, in, arc, lighting, allowed, a, single, generating, station, to, supply, a, string, of, lights, up, to, 7, miles, 11, km, long, and, each, doubling, of, voltage, would, allow, a, given, cable, to, transmit, the, same, amount, of, power, four, times, the, distance, than, at, the, lower, voltage, with, the, same, power, loss, by, contrast, direct, current, indoor, incandescent, lighting, systems, such, as, edison, s, first, power, station, installed, in, 1882, had, difficulty, supplying, customers, more, than, a, mile, away, because, they, used, a, low, voltage, 110, v, from, generation, to, end, use, the, low, voltage, translated, to, higher, current, and, required, thick, copper, cables, for, transmission, in, practice, edison, s, dc, generating, plants, needed, to, be, within, about, 1, 5, miles, 2, 4, km, of, the, farthest, customer, to, avoid, even, thicker, and, more, expensive, conductors, the, problem, of, transmitting, electricity, over, longer, distances, became, a, recognized, engineering, roadblock, to, electric, power, distribution, with, many, less, than, satisfactory, solutions, tested, by, lighting, companies, but, the, mid, 1880s, saw, a, breakthrough, with, the, development, of, functional, transformers, that, allowed, ac, power, to, be, stepped, up, to, much, a, higher, voltage, for, transmission, then, dropped, down, to, a, lower, voltage, near, the, end, user, compared, to, direct, current, ac, had, much, cheaper, transmission, costs, and, greater, economies, of, scale, with, large, ac, generating, plants, capable, of, supplying, whole, cities, and, regions, which, led, to, the, use, of, ac, spreading, rapidly, in, the, us, the, competition, between, direct, current, and, alternating, current, took, a, personal, turn, in, the, late, 1880s, in, the, form, of, a, war, of, currents, when, thomas, edison, started, attacking, george, westinghouse, and, his, development, of, the, first, us, ac, transformer, systems, highlighting, the, deaths, caused, by, high, voltage, ac, systems, over, the, years, and, claiming, any, ac, system, was, inherently, dangerous, edison, s, propaganda, campaign, was, short, lived, with, his, company, switching, over, to, ac, in, 1892, ac, became, the, dominant, form, of, transmission, of, power, with, innovations, in, europe, and, the, us, in, electric, motor, designs, and, the, development, of, engineered, universal, systems, allowing, the, large, number, of, legacy, systems, to, be, connected, to, large, ac, grids, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, in, many, places, the, electric, power, industry, was, vertically, integrated, meaning, that, one, company, did, generation, transmission, distribution, metering, and, billing, starting, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, nations, began, the, process, of, deregulation, and, privatization, leading, to, electricity, markets, the, distribution, system, would, remain, regulated, but, generation, retail, and, sometimes, transmission, systems, were, transformed, into, competitive, markets, electric, power, begins, at, a, generating, station, where, the, potential, difference, can, be, as, high, as, 33, 000, volts, ac, is, usually, used, users, of, large, amounts, of, dc, power, such, as, some, railway, electrification, systems, telephone, exchanges, and, industrial, processes, such, as, aluminium, smelting, use, rectifiers, to, derive, dc, from, the, public, ac, supply, or, may, have, their, own, generation, systems, high, voltage, dc, can, be, advantageous, for, isolating, alternating, current, systems, or, controlling, the, quantity, of, electricity, transmitted, for, example, hydro, qu, bec, has, a, direct, current, line, which, goes, from, the, james, bay, region, to, boston, from, the, generating, station, it, goes, to, the, generating, station, s, switchyard, where, a, step, up, transformer, increases, the, voltage, to, a, level, suitable, for, transmission, from, 44, kv, to, 765, kv, once, in, the, transmission, system, electricity, from, each, generating, station, is, combined, with, electricity, produced, elsewhere, for, this, to, be, possible, all, stations, must, be, synchronized, with, each, other, electricity, is, consumed, as, soon, as, it, is, produced, it, is, transmitted, at, a, very, high, speed, close, to, the, speed, of, light, in, power, distribution, according, to, iec, 60038, low, voltage, lv, is, defined, as, voltages, from, 100, volts, to, 1, kilovolt, kv, medium, voltage, mv, is, defined, as, voltages, from, over, 1, kv, to, 35, kv, high, voltage, hv, is, defined, as, voltages, from, above, 35, to, 230, kv, and, extra, high, voltage, ehv, is, defined, as, voltages, above, 245, kv, this, is, a, definition, that, has, changed, over, time, and, can, change, among, groups, of, engineers, depending, on, the, country, and, application, for, example, medium, voltage, can, be, defined, as, 1, to, 75, kv, and, ultra, high, voltage, uhv, can, be, defined, as, ac, voltages, of, or, over, 1000, kv, and, dc, voltages, of, or, over, 750, kv, according, to, the, society, of, automotive, engineers, sae, low, voltage, is, under, 30, volts, medium, voltage, is, 30, to, 60, volts, and, high, voltage, is, over, 60, volts, and, according, to, the, national, electrical, code, nec, used, in, buildings, in, the, usa, voltages, of, up, to, 30, volts, ac, or, 60, volts, dc, are, considered, low, voltage, and, voltages, higher, than, these, are, considered, high, voltage, primary, distribution, voltages, range, from, 4, kv, to, 35, kv, phase, to, phase, 2, 4, kv, to, 20, kv, phase, to, neutral, only, large, consumers, are, fed, directly, from, distribution, voltages, most, utility, customers, are, connected, to, a, transformer, which, reduces, the, distribution, voltage, to, the, low, voltage, utilization, voltage, supply, voltage, or, mains, voltage, used, by, lighting, and, interior, wiring, systems, distribution, networks, are, divided, into, two, types, radial, or, network, a, radial, system, is, arranged, like, a, tree, where, each, customer, has, one, source, of, supply, a, network, system, has, multiple, sources, of, supply, operating, in, parallel, spot, networks, are, used, for, concentrated, loads, radial, systems, are, commonly, used, in, rural, or, suburban, areas, radial, systems, usually, include, emergency, connections, where, the, system, can, be, reconfigured, in, case, of, problems, such, as, a, fault, or, planned, maintenance, this, can, be, done, by, opening, and, closing, switches, to, isolate, a, certain, section, from, the, grid, long, feeders, experience, voltage, drop, power, factor, distortion, requiring, capacitors, or, voltage, regulators, to, be, installed, reconfiguration, by, exchanging, the, functional, links, between, the, elements, of, the, system, represents, one, of, the, most, important, measures, which, can, improve, the, operational, performance, of, a, distribution, system, the, problem, of, optimization, through, the, reconfiguration, of, a, power, distribution, system, in, terms, of, its, definition, is, a, historical, single, objective, problem, with, constraints, since, 1975, when, merlin, and, back, introduced, the, idea, of, distribution, system, reconfiguration, for, active, power, loss, reduction, until, nowadays, a, lot, of, researchers, have, proposed, diverse, methods, and, algorithms, to, solve, the, reconfiguration, problem, as, a, single, objective, problem, some, authors, have, proposed, pareto, optimality, based, approaches, including, active, power, losses, and, reliability, indices, as, objectives, for, this, purpose, different, artificial, intelligence, based, methods, have, been, used, microgenetic, branch, exchange, particle, swarm, optimization, and, non, dominated, sorting, genetic, algorithm, rural, electrification, systems, tend, to, use, higher, distribution, voltages, because, of, the, longer, distances, covered, by, distribution, lines, see, rural, electrification, administration, 7, 2, 12, 47, 25, and, 34, 5, kv, distribution, is, common, in, the, united, states, 11, kv, and, 33, kv, are, common, in, the, uk, australia, and, new, zealand, 11, kv, and, 22, kv, are, common, in, south, africa, 10, 20, and, 35, kv, are, common, in, china, other, voltages, are, occasionally, used, rural, services, normally, try, to, minimize, the, number, of, poles, and, wires, it, uses, higher, voltages, than, urban, distribution, which, in, turn, permits, use, of, galvanized, steel, wire, the, strong, steel, wire, allows, for, less, expensive, wide, pole, spacing, in, rural, areas, a, pole, mount, transformer, may, serve, only, one, customer, in, new, zealand, australia, saskatchewan, canada, and, south, africa, single, wire, earth, return, systems, swer, are, used, to, electrify, remote, rural, areas, three, phase, service, provides, power, for, large, agricultural, facilities, petroleum, pumping, facilities, water, plants, or, other, customers, that, have, large, loads, three, phase, equipment, in, north, america, overhead, distribution, systems, may, be, three, phase, four, wire, with, a, neutral, conductor, rural, distribution, system, may, have, long, runs, of, one, phase, conductor, and, a, neutral, in, other, countries, or, in, extreme, rural, areas, the, neutral, wire, is, connected, to, the, ground, to, use, that, as, a, return, single, wire, earth, return, electricity, is, delivered, at, a, frequency, of, either, 50, or, 60, hz, depending, on, the, region, it, is, delivered, to, domestic, customers, as, single, phase, electric, power, in, some, countries, as, in, europe, a, three, phase, supply, may, be, made, available, for, larger, properties, seen, with, an, oscilloscope, the, domestic, power, supply, in, north, america, would, look, like, a, sine, wave, oscillating, between, 170, volts, and, 170, volts, giving, an, effective, voltage, of, 120, volts, rms, three, phase, electric, power, is, more, efficient, in, terms, of, power, delivered, per, cable, used, and, is, more, suited, to, running, large, electric, motors, some, large, european, appliances, may, be, powered, by, three, phase, power, such, as, electric, stoves, and, clothes, dryers, a, ground, connection, is, normally, provided, for, the, customer, s, system, as, well, as, for, the, equipment, owned, by, the, utility, the, purpose, of, connecting, the, customer, s, system, to, ground, is, to, limit, the, voltage, that, may, develop, if, high, voltage, conductors, fall, down, onto, lower, voltage, conductors, which, are, usually, mounted, lower, to, the, ground, or, if, a, failure, occurs, within, a, distribution, transformer, earthing, systems, can, be, tt, tn, s, tn, c, s, or, tn, c, most, of, the, world, uses, 50, hz, 220, or, 230, v, single, phase, or, 400, v, three, phase, for, residential, and, light, industrial, services, in, this, system, the, primary, distribution, network, supplies, a, few, substations, per, area, and, the, 230, v, 400, v, power, from, each, substation, is, directly, distributed, to, end, users, over, a, region, of, normally, less, than, 1, km, radius, three, live, hot, wires, and, the, neutral, are, connected, to, the, building, for, a, three, phase, service, single, phase, distribution, with, one, live, wire, and, the, neutral, is, used, domestically, where, total, loads, are, light, in, europe, electricity, is, normally, distributed, for, industry, and, domestic, use, by, the, three, phase, four, wire, system, this, gives, a, phase, to, phase, voltage, of, 400, volts, wye, service, and, a, single, phase, voltage, of, 230, volts, between, any, one, phase, and, neutral, in, the, uk, a, typical, urban, or, suburban, low, voltage, substation, would, normally, be, rated, between, 150, kva, and, 1, mva, and, supply, a, whole, neighbourhood, of, a, few, hundred, houses, transformers, are, typically, sized, on, an, average, load, of, 1, to, 2, kw, per, household, and, the, service, fuses, and, cable, is, sized, to, allow, any, one, property, to, draw, a, peak, load, of, perhaps, ten, times, this, for, industrial, customers, 3, phase, 690, 400, volt, is, also, available, or, may, be, generated, locally, large, industrial, customers, have, their, own, transformer, s, with, an, input, from, 11, kv, to, 220, kv, most, of, the, americas, use, 60, hz, ac, the, 120, 240, volt, split, phase, system, domestically, and, three, phase, for, larger, installations, north, american, transformers, usually, power, homes, at, 240, volts, similar, to, europe, s, 230, volts, it, is, the, split, phase, that, allows, use, of, 120, volts, in, the, home, in, the, electricity, sector, in, japan, the, standard, voltage, is, 100, v, with, both, 50, and, 60, hz, ac, frequencies, being, used, parts, of, the, country, use, 50, hz, while, other, parts, use, 60, hz, this, is, a, relic, from, the, 1890s, some, local, providers, in, tokyo, imported, 50, hz, german, equipment, while, the, local, power, providers, in, osaka, brought, in, 60, hz, generators, from, the, united, states, the, grids, grew, until, eventually, the, entire, country, was, wired, today, the, frequency, is, 50, hz, in, eastern, japan, including, tokyo, yokohama, tohoku, and, hokkaido, and, 60, hz, in, western, japan, including, nagoya, osaka, kyoto, hiroshima, shikoku, and, kyushu, most, household, appliances, are, made, to, work, on, either, frequency, the, problem, of, incompatibility, came, into, the, public, eye, when, the, 2011, t, hoku, earthquake, and, tsunami, knocked, out, about, a, third, of, the, east, s, capacity, and, power, in, the, west, could, not, be, fully, shared, with, the, east, since, the, country, does, not, have, a, common, frequency, there, are, four, high, voltage, direct, current, hvdc, converter, stations, that, move, power, across, japan, s, ac, frequency, border, shin, shinano, is, a, back, to, back, hvdc, facility, in, japan, which, forms, one, of, four, frequency, changer, stations, that, link, japan, s, western, and, eastern, power, grids, the, other, three, are, at, higashi, shimizu, minami, fukumitsu, and, sakuma, dam, together, they, can, move, up, to, 1, 2, gw, of, power, east, or, west, most, modern, north, american, homes, are, wired, to, receive, 240, volts, from, the, transformer, and, through, the, use, of, split, phase, electrical, power, can, have, both, 120, volt, receptacles, and, 240, volt, receptacles, the, 120, volts, is, typically, used, for, lighting, and, most, wall, outlets, the, 240, volt, circuits, are, typically, used, for, appliances, requiring, high, watt, heat, output, such, as, ovens, and, heaters, they, may, also, be, used, to, supply, an, electric, car, charger, traditionally, the, distribution, systems, would, only, operate, as, simple, distribution, lines, where, the, electricity, from, the, transmission, networks, would, be, shared, among, the, customers, today, s, distribution, systems, are, heavily, integrated, with, renewable, energy, generations, at, the, distribution, level, of, the, power, systems, by, the, means, of, distributed, generation, resources, such, as, solar, energy, and, wind, energy, as, a, result, distribution, systems, are, becoming, more, independent, from, the, transmission, networks, day, by, day, balancing, the, supply, demand, relationship, at, these, modern, distribution, networks, sometimes, referred, to, as, microgrids, is, extremely, challenging, and, it, requires, the, use, of, various, technological, and, operational, means, to, operate, such, tools, include, battery, storage, power, station, data, analytics, optimization, tools, etc
