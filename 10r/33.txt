https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillage
tillage, is, the, agricultural, preparation, of, soil, by, mechanical, agitation, of, various, types, such, as, digging, stirring, and, overturning, examples, of, human, powered, tilling, methods, using, hand, tools, include, shoveling, picking, mattock, work, hoeing, and, raking, examples, of, draft, animal, powered, or, mechanized, work, include, ploughing, overturning, with, moldboards, or, chiseling, with, chisel, shanks, rototilling, rolling, with, cultipackers, or, other, rollers, harrowing, and, cultivating, with, cultivator, shanks, teeth, tillage, that, is, deeper, and, more, thorough, is, classified, as, primary, and, tillage, that, is, shallower, and, sometimes, more, selective, of, location, is, secondary, primary, tillage, such, as, ploughing, tends, to, produce, a, rough, surface, finish, whereas, secondary, tillage, tends, to, produce, a, smoother, surface, finish, such, as, that, required, to, make, a, good, seedbed, for, many, crops, harrowing, and, rototilling, often, combine, primary, and, secondary, tillage, into, one, operation, tillage, can, also, mean, the, land, that, is, tilled, the, word, cultivation, has, several, senses, that, overlap, substantially, with, those, of, tillage, in, a, general, context, both, can, refer, to, agriculture, within, agriculture, both, can, refer, to, any, kind, of, soil, agitation, additionally, cultivation, or, cultivating, may, refer, to, an, even, narrower, sense, of, shallow, selective, secondary, tillage, of, row, crop, fields, that, kills, weeds, while, sparing, the, crop, plants, primary, tillage, loosens, the, soil, and, mixes, in, fertilizer, or, plant, material, resulting, in, soil, with, a, rough, texture, secondary, tillage, produces, finer, soil, and, sometimes, shapes, the, rows, preparing, the, seed, bed, it, also, provides, weed, control, throughout, the, growing, season, during, the, maturation, of, the, crop, plants, unless, such, weed, control, is, instead, achieved, with, low, till, or, no, till, methods, involving, herbicides, tilling, was, first, performed, via, human, labor, sometimes, involving, slaves, hoofed, animals, could, also, be, used, to, till, soil, by, trampling, in, addition, to, pigs, whose, natural, instincts, are, to, root, the, ground, regularly, if, allowed, to, the, wooden, plow, was, then, invented, it, is, difficult, to, pinpoint, the, exact, date, of, its, invention, however, the, earliest, evidence, of, plow, usage, dates, back, to, around, 4000, bce, in, mesopotamia, modern, day, iraq, it, could, be, pulled, with, human, labor, or, by, mule, ox, elephant, water, buffalo, or, a, similar, sturdy, animal, horses, are, generally, unsuitable, though, breeds, such, as, the, clydesdale, were, bred, as, draft, animals, tilling, could, at, times, be, very, labor, intensive, this, aspect, is, discussed, in, the, 16th, century, french, agronomic, text, written, by, charles, estienne, a, raw, rough, and, tough, soil, is, hard, to, till, and, will, neither, bring, forth, corn, nor, any, other, thing, without, great, labor, however, the, seasons, be, temperate, in, moisture, and, dryness, you, must, labor, it, most, exquisitely, harrow, it, and, manure, it, very, oft, with, great, store, of, dung, so, you, shall, make, it, better, but, especially, desire, that, they, may, not, be, watered, with, rain, for, water, is, as, good, as, poison, to, them, the, popularity, of, tillage, as, an, agricultural, technique, in, early, modern, times, had, to, do, with, theories, about, plant, biology, proposed, by, european, thinkers, in, 1731, english, writer, jethro, tull, published, the, book, horse, hoeing, husbandry, an, essay, on, the, principles, of, vegetation, and, tillage, which, argued, that, soil, needed, to, be, pulverized, into, fine, powder, for, plants, to, make, use, of, it, tull, believed, that, since, water, air, and, heat, were, clearly, not, the, primary, substance, of, a, plant, plants, were, made, of, earth, and, thus, had, to, consume, very, small, pieces, of, earth, as, food, tull, wrote, that, each, subsequent, tillage, of, the, soil, would, increase, its, fertility, and, that, it, was, impossible, to, till, the, soil, too, much, however, scientific, observation, has, shown, that, the, opposite, is, true, tillage, causes, soil, to, lose, structural, qualities, that, allow, plant, roots, water, and, nutrients, to, penetrate, it, accelerates, soil, loss, by, erosion, and, results, in, soil, compaction, the, steel, plow, allowed, farming, in, the, american, midwest, where, tough, prairie, grasses, and, rocks, caused, trouble, soon, after, 1900, the, farm, tractor, was, introduced, which, made, modern, large, scale, agriculture, possible, however, the, destruction, of, the, prairie, grasses, and, tillage, of, the, fertile, topsoil, of, the, american, midwest, caused, the, dust, bowl, in, which, the, soil, was, blown, away, and, stirred, up, into, dust, storms, that, blackened, the, sky, this, prompted, re, consideration, of, tillage, techniques, but, in, the, united, states, as, of, 2019, 3, trillion, pounds, of, soil, were, estimated, to, be, lost, due, to, erosion, while, adoption, of, improved, techniques, for, controlling, erosion, are, still, not, widespread, in, the, mid, 1930s, frank, and, herbert, petty, of, doncaster, victoria, australia, developed, the, petty, plough, this, steerable, plough, could, be, pulled, by, either, two, horses, or, a, tractor, and, the, disc, wheels, could, be, steered, in, unison, or, separately, allowing, the, operator, to, plough, the, center, of, rows, as, well, as, between, and, around, orchard, trees, primary, tillage, is, usually, conducted, after, the, last, harvest, when, the, soil, is, wet, enough, to, allow, plowing, but, also, allows, good, traction, some, soil, types, can, be, plowed, dry, the, objective, of, primary, tillage, is, to, attain, a, reasonable, depth, of, soft, soil, incorporate, crop, residues, kill, weeds, and, to, aerate, the, soil, secondary, tillage, is, any, subsequent, tillage, to, incorporate, fertilizers, reduce, the, soil, to, a, finer, tilth, level, the, surface, or, control, weeds, reduced, tillage, leaves, between, 15, and, 30, crop, residue, cover, on, the, soil, or, 500, to, 1000, pounds, per, acre, 560, to, 1100, kg, ha, of, small, grain, residue, during, the, critical, erosion, period, this, may, involve, the, use, of, a, chisel, plow, field, cultivators, or, other, implements, see, the, general, comments, below, to, see, how, they, can, affect, the, amount, of, residue, intensive, tillage, leaves, less, than, 15, crop, residue, cover, or, less, than, 500, pounds, per, acre, 560, kg, ha, of, small, grain, residue, this, type, of, tillage, is, often, referred, to, as, conventional, tillage, but, as, conservational, tillage, is, now, more, widely, used, than, intensive, tillage, in, the, united, states, it, is, often, not, appropriate, to, refer, to, this, type, of, tillage, as, conventional, intensive, tillage, often, involves, multiple, operations, with, implements, such, as, a, mold, board, disk, or, chisel, plow, after, this, a, finisher, with, a, harrow, rolling, basket, and, cutter, can, be, used, to, prepare, the, seed, bed, there, are, many, variations, conservation, tillage, leaves, at, least, 30, of, crop, residue, on, the, soil, surface, or, at, least, 1, 000, lb, ac, 1, 100, kg, ha, of, small, grain, residue, on, the, surface, during, the, critical, soil, erosion, period, this, slows, water, movement, which, reduces, the, amount, of, soil, erosion, additionally, conservation, tillage, has, been, found, to, benefit, predatory, arthropods, that, can, enhance, pest, control, conservation, tillage, also, benefits, farmers, by, reducing, fuel, consumption, and, soil, compaction, by, reducing, the, number, of, times, the, farmer, travels, over, the, field, significant, savings, in, fuel, and, labor, are, made, conservation, tillage, is, used, on, over, 370, million, acres, mostly, in, south, america, oceania, and, north, america, in, most, years, since, 1997, conservation, tillage, was, used, in, us, cropland, more, than, intensive, or, reduced, tillage, however, conservation, tillage, delays, warming, of, the, soil, due, to, the, reduction, of, dark, earth, exposure, to, the, warmth, of, the, spring, sun, thus, delaying, the, planting, of, the, next, year, s, spring, crop, of, corn, zone, tillage, is, a, form, of, modified, deep, tillage, in, which, only, narrow, strips, are, tilled, leaving, soil, in, between, the, rows, untilled, this, type, of, tillage, agitates, the, soil, to, help, reduce, soil, compaction, problems, and, to, improve, internal, soil, drainage, it, is, designed, to, only, disrupt, the, soil, in, a, narrow, strip, directly, below, the, crop, row, in, comparison, to, no, till, which, relies, on, the, previous, year, s, plant, residue, to, protect, the, soil, and, aids, in, postponement, of, the, warming, of, the, soil, and, crop, growth, in, northern, climates, zone, tillage, produces, a, strip, approximately, five, inches, wide, that, simultaneously, breaks, up, plow, pans, assists, in, warming, the, soil, and, helps, to, prepare, a, seedbed, when, combined, with, cover, crops, zone, tillage, helps, replace, lost, organic, matter, slows, the, deterioration, of, the, soil, improves, soil, drainage, increases, soil, water, and, nutrient, holding, capacity, and, allows, necessary, soil, organisms, to, survive, it, has, been, successfully, used, on, farms, in, the, midwest, and, west, of, the, usa, for, over, 40, years, and, is, currently, used, on, more, than, 36, of, the, u, s, farmland, some, specific, states, where, zone, tillage, is, currently, in, practice, are, pennsylvania, connecticut, minnesota, indiana, wisconsin, and, illinois, its, use, in, the, usa, s, northern, corn, belt, states, lacks, consistent, yield, results, however, there, is, still, interest, in, deep, tillage, within, agriculture, in, areas, that, are, not, well, drained, deep, tillage, may, be, used, as, an, alternative, to, installing, more, expensive, tile, drainage, plowing, tilling, can, damage, ancient, structures, such, as, long, barrows, in, the, uk, half, of, the, long, barrows, in, gloucestershire, and, almost, all, the, burial, mounds, in, essex, have, been, damaged, according, to, english, heritage, in, 2003, ploughing, with, modern, powerful, tractors, had, done, as, much, damage, in, the, last, six, decades, as, traditional, farming, did, in, the, previous, six, centuries, modern, agricultural, science, has, greatly, reduced, the, use, of, tillage, crops, can, be, grown, for, several, years, without, any, tillage, through, the, use, of, herbicides, to, control, weeds, crop, varieties, that, tolerate, packed, soil, and, equipment, that, can, plant, seeds, or, fumigate, the, soil, without, really, digging, it, up, this, practice, called, no, till, farming, reduces, costs, and, environmental, change, by, reducing, soil, erosion, and, diesel, fuel, usage, site, preparation, is, any, of, various, treatments, applied, to, a, site, to, ready, it, for, seeding, or, planting, the, purpose, is, to, facilitate, the, regeneration, of, that, site, by, the, chosen, method, site, preparation, may, be, designed, to, achieve, singly, or, in, any, combination, improved, access, by, reducing, or, rearranging, slash, and, amelioration, of, adverse, forest, floor, soil, vegetation, or, other, biotic, factors, site, preparation, is, undertaken, to, ameliorate, one, or, more, constraints, that, would, otherwise, be, likely, to, thwart, the, objectives, of, management, a, valuable, bibliography, on, the, effects, of, soil, temperature, and, site, preparation, on, subalpine, and, boreal, tree, species, has, been, prepared, by, mckinnon, et, al, 2002, site, preparation, is, the, work, that, is, done, before, a, forest, area, is, regenerated, some, types, of, site, preparation, are, burning, broadcast, burning, is, commonly, used, to, prepare, clearcut, sites, for, planting, e, g, in, central, british, columbia, and, in, the, temperate, region, of, north, america, generally, prescribed, burning, is, carried, out, primarily, for, slash, hazard, reduction, and, to, improve, site, conditions, for, regeneration, all, or, some, of, the, following, benefits, may, accrue, prescribed, burning, for, preparing, sites, for, direct, seeding, was, tried, on, a, few, occasions, in, ontario, but, none, of, the, burns, was, hot, enough, to, produce, a, seedbed, that, was, adequate, without, supplementary, mechanical, site, preparation, changes, in, soil, chemical, properties, associated, with, burning, include, significantly, increased, ph, which, macadam, 1987, in, the, sub, boreal, spruce, zone, of, central, british, columbia, found, persisting, more, than, a, year, after, the, burn, average, fuel, consumption, was, 20, to, 24, t, ha, and, the, forest, floor, depth, was, reduced, by, 28, to, 36, the, increases, correlated, well, with, the, amounts, of, slash, both, total, and, 7, cm, diameter, consumed, the, change, in, ph, depends, on, the, severity, of, the, burn, and, the, amount, consumed, the, increase, can, be, as, much, as, 2, units, a, 100, fold, change, deficiencies, of, copper, and, iron, in, the, foliage, of, white, spruce, on, burned, clearcuts, in, central, british, columbia, might, be, attributable, to, elevated, ph, levels, even, a, broadcast, slash, fire, in, a, clearcut, does, not, give, a, uniform, burn, over, the, whole, area, tarrant, 1954, for, instance, found, only, 4, of, a, 140, ha, slash, burn, had, burned, severely, 47, had, burned, lightly, and, 49, was, unburned, burning, after, windrowing, obviously, accentuates, the, subsequent, heterogeneity, marked, increases, in, exchangeable, calcium, also, correlated, with, the, amount, of, slash, at, least, 7, cm, in, diameter, consumed, phosphorus, availability, also, increased, both, in, the, forest, floor, and, in, the, 0, cm, to, 15, cm, mineral, soil, layer, and, the, increase, was, still, evident, albeit, somewhat, diminished, 21, months, after, burning, however, in, another, study, in, the, same, sub, boreal, spruce, zone, found, that, although, it, increased, immediately, after, the, burn, phosphorus, availability, had, dropped, to, below, pre, burn, levels, within, 9, months, nitrogen, will, be, lost, from, the, site, by, burning, though, concentrations, in, remaining, forest, floor, were, found, by, macadam, 1987, to, have, increased, in, two, out, of, six, plots, the, others, showing, decreases, nutrient, losses, may, be, outweighed, at, least, in, the, short, term, by, improved, soil, microclimate, through, the, reduced, thickness, of, forest, floor, where, low, soil, temperatures, are, a, limiting, factor, the, picea, abies, forests, of, the, alberta, foothills, are, often, characterized, by, deep, accumulations, of, organic, matter, on, the, soil, surface, and, cold, soil, temperatures, both, of, which, make, reforestation, difficult, and, result, in, a, general, deterioration, in, site, productivity, endean, and, johnstone, 1974, describe, experiments, to, test, prescribed, burning, as, a, means, of, seedbed, preparation, and, site, amelioration, on, representative, clear, felled, picea, abies, areas, results, showed, that, in, general, prescribed, burning, did, not, reduce, organic, layers, satisfactorily, nor, did, it, increase, soil, temperature, on, the, sites, tested, increases, in, seedling, establishment, survival, and, growth, on, the, burned, sites, were, probably, the, result, of, slight, reductions, in, the, depth, of, the, organic, layer, minor, increases, in, soil, temperature, and, marked, improvements, in, the, efficiency, of, the, planting, crews, results, also, suggested, that, the, process, of, site, deterioration, has, not, been, reversed, by, the, burning, treatments, applied, slash, weight, the, oven, dry, weight, of, the, entire, crown, and, that, portion, of, the, stem, less, than, four, inches, in, diameter, and, size, distribution, are, major, factors, influencing, the, forest, fire, hazard, on, harvested, sites, forest, managers, interested, in, the, application, of, prescribed, burning, for, hazard, reduction, and, silviculture, were, shown, a, method, for, quantifying, the, slash, load, by, kiil, 1968, in, west, central, alberta, he, felled, measured, and, weighed, 60, white, spruce, graphed, a, slash, weight, per, merchantable, unit, volume, against, diameter, at, breast, height, dbh, and, b, weight, of, fine, slash, 1, 27, cm, also, against, dbh, and, produced, a, table, of, slash, weight, and, size, distribution, on, one, acre, of, a, hypothetical, stand, of, white, spruce, when, the, diameter, distribution, of, a, stand, is, unknown, an, estimate, of, slash, weight, and, size, distribution, can, be, obtained, from, average, stand, diameter, number, of, trees, per, unit, area, and, merchantable, cubic, foot, volume, the, sample, trees, in, kiil, s, study, had, full, symmetrical, crowns, densely, growing, trees, with, short, and, often, irregular, crowns, would, probably, be, overestimated, open, grown, trees, with, long, crowns, would, probably, be, underestimated, the, need, to, provide, shade, for, young, outplants, of, engelmann, spruce, in, the, high, rocky, mountains, is, emphasized, by, the, u, s, forest, service, acceptable, planting, spots, are, defined, as, microsites, on, the, north, and, east, sides, of, down, logs, stumps, or, slash, and, lying, in, the, shadow, cast, by, such, material, where, the, objectives, of, management, specify, more, uniform, spacing, or, higher, densities, than, obtainable, from, an, existing, distribution, of, shade, providing, material, redistribution, or, importing, of, such, material, has, been, undertaken, site, preparation, on, some, sites, might, be, done, simply, to, facilitate, access, by, planters, or, to, improve, access, and, increase, the, number, or, distribution, of, microsites, suitable, for, planting, or, seeding, wang, et, al, 2000, determined, field, performance, of, white, and, black, spruces, 8, and, 9, years, after, outplanting, on, boreal, mixedwood, sites, following, site, preparation, donaren, disc, trenching, versus, no, trenching, in, 2, plantation, types, open, versus, sheltered, in, southeastern, manitoba, donaren, trenching, slightly, reduced, the, mortality, of, black, spruce, but, significantly, increased, the, mortality, of, white, spruce, significant, difference, in, height, was, found, between, open, and, sheltered, plantations, for, black, spruce, but, not, for, white, spruce, and, root, collar, diameter, in, sheltered, plantations, was, significantly, larger, than, in, open, plantations, for, black, spruce, but, not, for, white, spruce, black, spruce, open, plantation, had, significantly, smaller, volume, 97, cm, 3, compared, with, black, spruce, sheltered, 210, cm, 3, as, well, as, white, spruce, open, 175, cm, 3, and, sheltered, 229, cm, 3, plantations, white, spruce, open, plantations, also, had, smaller, volume, than, white, spruce, sheltered, plantations, for, transplant, stock, strip, plantations, had, a, significantly, higher, volume, 329, cm, 3, than, open, plantations, 204, cm, 3, wang, et, al, 2000, recommended, that, sheltered, plantation, site, preparation, should, be, used, up, to, 1970, no, sophisticated, site, preparation, equipment, had, become, operational, in, ontario, but, the, need, for, more, efficacious, and, versatile, equipment, was, increasingly, recognized, by, this, time, improvements, were, being, made, to, equipment, originally, developed, by, field, staff, and, field, testing, of, equipment, from, other, sources, was, increasing, according, to, j, hall, 1970, in, ontario, at, least, the, most, widely, used, site, preparation, technique, was, post, harvest, mechanical, scarification, by, equipment, front, mounted, on, a, bulldozer, blade, rake, v, plow, or, teeth, or, dragged, behind, a, tractor, imsett, or, s, f, i, scarifier, or, rolling, chopper, drag, type, units, designed, and, constructed, by, ontario, s, department, of, lands, and, forests, used, anchor, chain, or, tractor, pads, separately, or, in, combination, or, were, finned, steel, drums, or, barrels, of, various, sizes, and, used, in, sets, alone, or, combined, with, tractor, pad, or, anchor, chain, units, j, hall, s, 1970, report, on, the, state, of, site, preparation, in, ontario, noted, that, blades, and, rakes, were, found, to, be, well, suited, to, post, cut, scarification, in, tolerant, hardwood, stands, for, natural, regeneration, of, yellow, birch, plows, were, most, effective, for, treating, dense, brush, prior, to, planting, often, in, conjunction, with, a, planting, machine, scarifying, teeth, e, g, young, s, teeth, were, sometimes, used, to, prepare, sites, for, planting, but, their, most, effective, use, was, found, to, be, preparing, sites, for, seeding, particularly, in, backlog, areas, carrying, light, brush, and, dense, herbaceous, growth, rolling, choppers, found, application, in, treating, heavy, brush, but, could, be, used, only, on, stone, free, soils, finned, drums, were, commonly, used, on, jack, pine, spruce, cutovers, on, fresh, brushy, sites, with, a, deep, duff, layer, and, heavy, slash, and, they, needed, to, be, teamed, with, a, tractor, pad, unit, to, secure, good, distribution, of, the, slash, the, s, f, i, scarifier, after, strengthening, had, been, quite, successful, for, 2, years, promising, trials, were, under, way, with, the, cone, scarifier, and, barrel, ring, scarifier, and, development, had, begun, on, a, new, flail, scarifier, for, use, on, sites, with, shallow, rocky, soils, recognition, of, the, need, to, become, more, effective, and, efficient, in, site, preparation, led, the, ontario, department, of, lands, and, forests, to, adopt, the, policy, of, seeking, and, obtaining, for, field, testing, new, equipment, from, scandinavia, and, elsewhere, that, seemed, to, hold, promise, for, ontario, conditions, primarily, in, the, north, thus, testing, was, begun, of, the, brackekultivator, from, sweden, and, the, vako, visko, rotary, furrower, from, finland, site, preparation, treatments, that, create, raised, planting, spots, have, commonly, improved, outplant, performance, on, sites, subject, to, low, soil, temperature, and, excess, soil, moisture, mounding, can, certainly, have, a, big, influence, on, soil, temperature, draper, et, al, 1985, for, instance, documented, this, as, well, as, the, effect, it, had, on, root, growth, of, outplants, table, 30, the, mounds, warmed, up, quickest, and, at, soil, depths, of, 0, 5, cm, and, 10, cm, averaged, 10, and, 7, c, higher, respectively, than, in, the, control, on, sunny, days, daytime, surface, temperature, maxima, on, the, mound, and, organic, mat, reached, 25, c, to, 60, c, depending, on, soil, wetness, and, shading, mounds, reached, mean, soil, temperatures, of, 10, c, at, 10, cm, depth, 5, days, after, planting, but, the, control, did, not, reach, that, temperature, until, 58, days, after, planting, during, the, first, growing, season, mounds, had, 3, times, as, many, days, with, a, mean, soil, temperature, greater, than, 10, c, than, did, the, control, microsites, draper, et, al, s, 1985, mounds, received, 5, times, the, amount, of, photosynthetically, active, radiation, par, summed, over, all, sampled, microsites, throughout, the, first, growing, season, the, control, treatment, consistently, received, about, 14, of, daily, background, par, while, mounds, received, over, 70, by, november, fall, frosts, had, reduced, shading, eliminating, the, differential, quite, apart, from, its, effect, on, temperature, incident, radiation, is, also, important, photosynthetically, the, average, control, microsite, was, exposed, to, levels, of, light, above, the, compensation, point, for, only, 3, hours, i, e, one, quarter, of, the, daily, light, period, whereas, mounds, received, light, above, the, compensation, point, for, 11, hours, i, e, 86, of, the, same, daily, period, assuming, that, incident, light, in, the, 100, 600, e, m, 2, s, intensity, range, is, the, most, important, for, photosynthesis, the, mounds, received, over, 4, times, the, total, daily, light, energy, that, reached, the, control, microsites, with, linear, site, preparation, orientation, is, sometimes, dictated, by, topography, or, other, considerations, but, the, orientation, can, often, be, chosen, it, can, make, a, difference, a, disk, trenching, experiment, in, the, sub, boreal, spruce, zone, in, interior, british, columbia, investigated, the, effect, on, growth, of, young, outplants, lodgepole, pine, in, 13, microsite, planting, positions, berm, hinge, and, trench, in, each, of, north, south, east, and, west, aspects, as, well, as, in, untreated, locations, between, the, furrows, tenth, year, stem, volumes, of, trees, on, south, east, and, west, facing, microsites, were, significantly, greater, than, those, of, trees, on, north, facing, and, untreated, microsites, however, planting, spot, selection, was, seen, to, be, more, important, overall, than, trench, orientation, in, a, minnesota, study, the, n, s, strips, accumulated, more, snow, but, snow, melted, faster, than, on, e, w, strips, in, the, first, year, after, felling, snow, melt, was, faster, on, strips, near, the, centre, of, the, strip, felled, area, than, on, border, strips, adjoining, the, intact, stand, the, strips, 50, feet, 15, 24, m, wide, alternating, with, uncut, strips, 16, feet, 4, 88, m, wide, were, felled, in, a, pinus, resinosa, stand, aged, 90, to, 100, years
