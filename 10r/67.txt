a, word, processor, wp, is, a, device, or, computer, program, that, provides, for, input, editing, formatting, and, output, of, text, often, with, some, additional, features, early, word, processors, were, stand, alone, devices, dedicated, to, the, function, but, current, word, processors, are, word, processor, programs, running, on, general, purpose, computers, the, functions, of, a, word, processor, program, fall, somewhere, between, those, of, a, simple, text, editor, and, a, fully, functioned, desktop, publishing, program, while, the, distinction, between, a, text, editor, and, a, word, processor, is, clear, namely, the, capability, of, editing, rich, text, the, distinctions, between, a, word, processor, and, a, desktop, publishing, program, has, become, unclear, as, word, processing, software, has, gained, features, such, as, ligature, support, added, to, the, 2010, version, of, microsoft, word, common, word, processor, programs, include, libreoffice, writer, google, docs, and, microsoft, word, word, processors, developed, from, mechanical, machines, later, merging, with, computer, technology, the, history, of, word, processing, is, the, story, of, the, gradual, automation, of, the, physical, aspects, of, writing, and, editing, and, then, to, the, refinement, of, the, technology, to, make, it, available, to, corporations, and, individuals, the, term, word, processing, appeared, in, american, offices, in, the, early, 1970s, centered, on, the, idea, of, streamlining, the, work, to, typists, but, the, meaning, soon, shifted, toward, the, automation, of, the, whole, editing, cycle, at, first, the, designers, of, word, processing, systems, combined, existing, technologies, with, emerging, ones, to, develop, stand, alone, equipment, creating, a, new, business, distinct, from, the, emerging, world, of, the, personal, computer, the, concept, of, word, processing, arose, from, the, more, general, data, processing, which, since, the, 1950s, had, been, the, application, of, computers, to, business, administration, through, history, there, have, been, three, types, of, word, processors, mechanical, electronic, and, software, the, first, word, processing, device, a, machine, for, transcribing, letters, that, appears, to, have, been, similar, to, a, typewriter, was, patented, in, 1714, by, henry, mill, for, a, machine, that, was, capable, of, writing, so, clearly, and, accurately, you, could, not, distinguish, it, from, a, printing, press, more, than, a, century, later, another, patent, appeared, in, the, name, of, william, austin, burt, for, the, typographer, in, the, late, 19th, century, christopher, latham, sholes, created, the, first, recognizable, typewriter, which, was, described, as, a, literary, piano, the, only, word, processing, these, mechanical, systems, could, perform, was, to, change, where, letters, appeared, on, the, page, to, fill, in, spaces, that, were, previously, left, on, the, page, or, to, skip, over, lines, it, was, not, until, decades, later, that, the, introduction, of, electricity, and, electronics, into, typewriters, began, to, help, the, writer, with, the, mechanical, part, the, term, word, processing, translated, from, the, german, word, textverarbeitung, itself, was, possibly, created, in, the, 1950s, by, ulrich, steinhilper, a, german, ibm, typewriter, sales, executive, or, by, an, american, electro, mechanical, typewriter, executive, george, m, ryan, who, obtained, a, trademark, registration, in, the, uspto, for, the, phrase, however, it, did, not, make, its, appearance, in, 1960s, office, management, or, computing, literature, an, example, of, grey, literature, though, many, of, the, ideas, products, and, technologies, to, which, it, would, later, be, applied, were, already, well, known, nonetheless, by, 1971, the, term, was, recognized, by, the, new, york, times, as, a, business, buzz, word, word, processing, paralleled, the, more, general, data, processing, or, the, application, of, computers, to, business, administration, thus, by, 1972, the, discussion, of, word, processing, was, common, in, publications, devoted, to, business, office, management, and, technology, by, the, mid, 1970s, the, term, would, have, been, familiar, to, any, office, manager, who, consulted, business, periodicals, by, the, late, 1960s, ibm, had, developed, the, ibm, mt, st, magnetic, tape, selectric, typewriter, it, was, a, model, of, the, ibm, selectric, typewriter, from, earlier, in, 1961, but, it, came, built, into, its, own, desk, integrated, with, magnetic, tape, recording, and, playback, facilities, along, with, controls, and, a, bank, of, electrical, relays, the, mt, st, automated, word, wrap, but, it, had, no, screen, this, device, allowed, a, user, to, rewrite, text, that, had, been, written, on, another, tape, and, it, also, allowed, limited, collaboration, in, the, sense, that, a, user, could, send, the, tape, to, another, person, to, let, them, edit, the, document, or, make, a, copy, it, was, a, revolution, for, the, word, processing, industry, in, 1969, the, tapes, were, replaced, by, magnetic, cards, these, memory, cards, were, inserted, into, an, extra, device, that, accompanied, the, mt, st, able, to, read, and, record, users, work, throughout, the, 1960s, and, 70s, word, processing, began, to, slowly, shift, from, glorified, typewriters, augmented, with, electronic, features, to, become, fully, computer, based, although, only, with, single, purpose, hardware, with, the, development, of, several, innovations, just, before, the, arrival, of, the, personal, computer, pc, ibm, developed, the, floppy, disk, in, the, 1970s, the, first, proper, word, processing, systems, appeared, which, allowed, display, and, editing, of, documents, on, crt, screens, during, this, era, these, early, stand, alone, word, processing, systems, were, designed, built, and, marketed, by, several, pioneering, companies, linolex, systems, was, founded, in, 1970, by, james, lincoln, and, robert, oleksiak, linolex, based, its, technology, on, microprocessors, floppy, drives, and, software, it, was, a, computer, based, system, for, application, in, the, word, processing, businesses, and, it, sold, systems, through, its, own, sales, force, with, a, base, of, installed, systems, in, over, 500, sites, linolex, systems, sold, 3, million, units, in, 1975, a, year, before, the, apple, computer, was, released, at, that, time, the, lexitron, corporation, also, produced, a, series, of, dedicated, word, processing, microcomputers, lexitron, was, the, first, to, use, a, full, sized, video, display, screen, crt, in, its, models, by, 1978, lexitron, also, used, 5, 1, 4, inch, floppy, diskettes, which, became, the, standard, in, the, personal, computer, field, the, program, disk, was, inserted, in, one, drive, and, the, system, booted, up, the, data, diskette, was, then, put, in, the, second, drive, the, operating, system, and, the, word, processing, program, were, combined, in, one, file, another, of, the, early, word, processing, adopters, was, vydec, which, created, in, 1973, the, first, modern, text, processor, the, vydec, word, processing, system, it, had, built, in, multiple, functions, like, the, ability, to, share, content, by, diskette, and, print, it, the, vydec, word, processing, system, sold, for, 12, 000, at, the, time, about, 60, 000, adjusted, for, inflation, the, redactron, corporation, organized, by, evelyn, berezin, in, 1969, designed, and, manufactured, editing, systems, including, correcting, editing, typewriters, cassette, and, card, units, and, eventually, a, word, processor, called, the, data, secretary, the, burroughs, corporation, acquired, redactron, in, 1976, a, crt, based, system, by, wang, laboratories, became, one, of, the, most, popular, systems, of, the, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, the, wang, system, displayed, text, on, a, crt, screen, and, incorporated, virtually, every, fundamental, characteristic, of, word, processors, as, they, are, known, today, while, early, computerized, word, processor, system, were, often, expensive, and, hard, to, use, that, is, like, the, computer, mainframes, of, the, 1960s, the, wang, system, was, a, true, office, machine, affordable, to, organizations, such, as, medium, sized, law, firms, and, easily, mastered, and, operated, by, secretarial, staff, the, phrase, word, processor, rapidly, came, to, refer, to, crt, based, machines, similar, to, wang, s, numerous, machines, of, this, kind, emerged, typically, marketed, by, traditional, office, equipment, companies, such, as, ibm, lanier, aes, data, machines, re, badged, cpt, and, nbi, all, were, specialized, dedicated, proprietary, systems, with, prices, in, the, 10, 000, range, cheap, general, purpose, personal, computers, were, still, the, domain, of, hobbyists, in, japan, even, though, typewriters, with, japanese, writing, system, had, widely, been, used, for, businesses, and, governments, they, were, limited, to, specialists, and, required, special, skills, due, to, the, wide, variety, of, letters, until, computer, based, devices, came, onto, the, market, in, 1977, sharp, showcased, a, prototype, of, a, computer, based, word, processing, dedicated, device, with, japanese, writing, system, in, business, show, in, tokyo, toshiba, released, the, first, japanese, word, processor, jw, 10, in, february, 1979, the, price, was, 6, 300, 000, jpy, equivalent, to, us, 45, 000, this, is, selected, as, one, of, the, milestones, of, ieee, the, japanese, writing, system, uses, a, large, number, of, kanji, logographic, chinese, characters, which, require, 2, bytes, to, store, so, having, one, key, per, each, symbol, is, infeasible, japanese, word, processing, became, possible, with, the, development, of, the, japanese, input, method, a, sequence, of, keypresses, with, visual, feedback, which, selects, a, character, now, widely, used, in, personal, computers, oki, launched, oki, word, editor, 200, in, march, 1979, with, this, kana, based, keyboard, input, system, in, 1980, several, electronics, and, office, equipment, brands, including, entered, this, rapidly, growing, market, with, more, compact, and, affordable, devices, for, instance, nec, introduced, the, nwp, 20, and, fujitsu, launched, the, fujitsu, oasys, while, the, average, unit, price, in, 1980, was, 2, 000, 000, jpy, us, 14, 300, it, was, dropped, to, 164, 000, jpy, us, 1, 200, in, 1985, even, after, personal, computers, became, widely, available, japanese, word, processors, remained, popular, as, they, tended, to, be, more, portable, an, office, computer, was, initially, too, large, to, carry, around, and, become, commonplace, for, business, and, academics, even, for, private, individuals, in, the, second, half, of, the, 1980s, the, phrase, word, processor, has, been, abbreviated, as, wa, pro, or, wapuro, in, japanese, the, final, step, in, word, processing, came, with, the, advent, of, the, personal, computer, in, the, late, 1970s, and, 1980s, and, with, the, subsequent, creation, of, word, processing, software, word, processing, software, that, would, create, much, more, complex, and, capable, output, was, developed, and, prices, began, to, fall, making, them, more, accessible, to, the, public, by, the, late, 1970s, computerized, word, processors, were, still, primarily, used, by, employees, composing, documents, for, large, and, midsized, businesses, e, g, law, firms, and, newspapers, within, a, few, years, the, falling, prices, of, pcs, made, word, processing, available, for, the, first, time, to, all, writers, in, the, convenience, of, their, homes, the, first, word, processing, program, for, personal, computers, microcomputers, was, electric, pencil, from, michael, shrayer, software, which, went, on, sale, in, december, 1976, in, 1978, wordstar, appeared, and, because, of, its, many, new, features, soon, dominated, the, market, wordstar, was, written, for, the, early, cp, m, control, program, micro, operating, system, ported, to, cp, m, 86, then, to, ms, dos, and, was, the, most, popular, word, processing, program, until, 1985, when, wordperfect, sales, first, exceeded, wordstar, sales, early, word, processing, software, was, not, as, intuitive, as, word, processor, devices, most, early, word, processing, software, required, users, to, memorize, semi, mnemonic, key, combinations, rather, than, pressing, keys, such, as, copy, or, bold, moreover, cp, m, lacked, cursor, keys, for, example, wordstar, used, the, e, s, d, x, centered, diamond, for, cursor, navigation, a, notable, exception, was, the, software, lexitype, for, ms, dos, that, took, inspiration, from, the, lexitron, dedicated, word, processor, s, user, interface, and, which, mapped, individual, functions, to, particular, keyboard, function, keys, and, a, set, of, stick, on, keycaps, describing, the, function, were, provided, with, the, software, lexitype, was, popular, with, large, organizations, that, had, previously, used, the, lexitron, eventually, the, price, differences, between, dedicated, word, processors, and, general, purpose, pcs, and, the, value, added, to, the, latter, by, software, such, as, killer, app, spreadsheet, applications, e, g, visicalc, and, lotus, 1, 2, 3, were, so, compelling, that, personal, computers, and, word, processing, software, became, serious, competition, for, the, dedicated, machines, and, soon, dominated, the, market, in, the, late, 1980s, innovations, such, as, the, advent, of, laser, printers, a, typographic, approach, to, word, processing, wysiwyg, what, you, see, is, what, you, get, using, bitmap, displays, with, multiple, fonts, pioneered, by, the, xerox, alto, computer, and, bravo, word, processing, program, and, graphical, user, interfaces, such, as, copy, and, paste, another, xerox, parc, innovation, with, the, gypsy, word, processor, these, were, popularized, by, macwrite, on, the, apple, macintosh, in, 1983, and, microsoft, word, on, the, ibm, pc, in, 1984, these, were, probably, the, first, true, wysiwyg, word, processors, to, become, known, to, many, people, of, particular, interest, also, is, the, standardization, of, truetype, fonts, used, in, both, macintosh, and, windows, pcs, while, the, publishers, of, the, operating, systems, provide, truetype, typefaces, they, are, largely, gathered, from, traditional, typefaces, converted, by, smaller, font, publishing, houses, to, replicate, standard, fonts, demand, for, new, and, interesting, fonts, which, can, be, found, free, of, copyright, restrictions, or, commissioned, from, font, designers, developed, the, growing, popularity, of, the, windows, operating, system, in, the, 1990s, later, took, microsoft, word, along, with, it, originally, called, microsoft, multi, tool, word, this, program, quickly, became, a, synonym, for, word, processor, early, in, the, 21st, century, google, docs, popularized, the, transition, to, online, or, offline, web, browser, based, word, processing, this, was, enabled, by, the, widespread, adoption, of, suitable, internet, connectivity, in, businesses, and, domestic, households, and, later, the, popularity, of, smartphones, google, docs, enabled, word, processing, from, within, any, vendor, s, web, browser, which, could, run, on, any, vendor, s, operating, system, on, any, physical, device, type, including, tablets, and, smartphones, although, offline, editing, is, limited, to, a, few, chromium, based, web, browsers, google, docs, also, enabled, the, significant, growth, of, use, of, information, technology, such, as, remote, access, to, files, and, collaborative, real, time, editing, both, becoming, simple, to, do, with, little, or, no, need, for, costly, software, and, specialist, it, support
