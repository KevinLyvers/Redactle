systems, existed, the, payment, models, varied, but, most, mail, was, sent, unpaid, requiring, the, recipient, to, pay, the, postage, fee, in, some, regions, a, partial, payment, was, made, by, the, sender, today, worldwide, the, most, common, method, of, prepaying, postage, is, by, buying, an, adhesive, postage, stamp, to, be, applied, to, the, envelope, before, mailing, a, much, less, common, method, is, to, use, a, postage, prepaid, envelope, franking, is, a, method, of, creating, postage, prepaid, envelopes, under, licence, using, a, special, machine, they, are, used, by, companies, with, large, mail, programs, such, as, banks, and, direct, mail, companies, in, 1998, the, u, s, postal, service, authorised, the, first, tests, of, a, secure, system, of, sending, digital, franks, via, the, internet, to, be, printed, out, on, a, pc, printer, obviating, the, necessity, to, license, a, dedicated, franking, machine, and, allowing, companies, with, smaller, mail, programs, to, make, use, of, the, option, this, was, later, expanded, to, test, the, use, of, personalized, postage, the, service, provided, by, the, u, s, postal, service, in, 2003, allows, the, franks, to, be, printed, out, on, special, adhesive, backed, labels, in, 2004, the, royal, mail, in, the, united, kingdom, introduced, its, smartstamp, internet, based, system, allowing, printing, on, ordinary, adhesive, labels, or, envelopes, similar, systems, are, being, considered, by, postal, administrations, around, the, world, when, the, pre, paid, envelope, or, package, is, accepted, into, the, mail, by, an, agent, of, the, postal, service, the, agent, usually, indicates, by, means, of, a, cancellation, that, it, is, no, longer, valid, for, pre, payment, of, postage, the, exceptions, are, when, the, agent, forgets, or, neglects, to, cancel, the, mailpiece, for, stamps, that, are, pre, cancelled, and, thus, do, not, require, cancellation, and, for, in, most, cases, metered, mail, the, personalized, stamps, authorized, by, the, usps, and, manufactured, by, zazzle, and, other, companies, are, in, fact, a, form, of, meter, label, and, thus, do, not, need, to, be, cancelled, documents, should, generally, not, be, read, by, anyone, other, than, the, addressee, for, example, in, the, united, states, of, america, it, is, a, violation, of, federal, law, for, anyone, other, than, the, addressee, and, the, government, to, open, mail, there, are, exceptions, however, executives, often, assign, secretaries, or, assistants, the, task, of, handling, their, mail, and, postcards, do, not, require, opening, and, can, be, read, by, anyone, for, mail, contained, within, an, envelope, there, are, legal, provisions, in, some, jurisdictions, allowing, the, recording, of, identities, of, sender, and, recipient, the, privacy, of, correspondence, is, guaranteed, by, the, constitutions, of, mexico, colombia, brazil, and, venezuela, and, is, alluded, to, in, the, european, convention, on, human, rights, and, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, the, control, of, the, contents, inside, private, citizens, mail, is, censorship, and, concerns, social, political, and, legal, aspects, of, civil, rights, international, mail, and, packages, are, subject, to, customs, control, with, the, mail, and, packages, often, surveyed, and, their, contents, sometimes, edited, out, or, even, in, there, have, been, cases, over, the, millennia, of, governments, opening, and, copying, or, photographing, the, contents, of, private, mail, subject, to, the, laws, in, the, relevant, jurisdiction, correspondence, may, be, openly, or, covertly, opened, or, the, contents, determined, via, some, other, method, by, the, police, or, other, authorities, in, some, cases, relating, to, a, suspected, criminal, conspiracy, although, black, chambers, largely, in, the, past, though, there, is, apparently, some, continuance, of, their, use, today, opened, extralegally, the, mail, service, may, be, allowed, to, open, the, mail, if, neither, addressee, nor, sender, can, be, located, in, order, to, attempt, to, locate, either, mail, service, may, also, open, the, mail, to, inspect, if, it, contains, materials, that, are, hazardous, to, transport, or, violate, local, laws, while, in, most, cases, mail, censorship, is, exceptional, military, mail, to, and, from, soldiers, is, often, subject, to, surveillance, the, mail, is, censored, to, prevent, leaking, tactical, secrets, such, as, troop, movements, or, weather, conditions, depending, on, the, country, civilian, mail, containing, military, secrets, can, also, be, monitored, and, censored, mail, sent, to, and, from, inmates, in, jails, or, prisons, within, the, united, states, is, subject, to, opening, and, review, by, jail, or, prison, staff, to, determine, if, the, mail, has, any, criminal, action, dictated, or, provides, means, for, an, escape, the, only, mail, that, is, not, able, to, be, read, is, attorney, client, mail, which, is, covered, under, the, attorney, client, confidentiality, laws, in, the, united, states, modern, alternatives, such, as, the, telegraph, telephone, telex, facsimile, and, email, have, reduced, the, attractiveness, of, paper, mail, for, many, applications, these, modern, alternatives, have, some, advantages, in, addition, to, their, speed, they, may, be, more, secure, e, g, because, the, general, public, cannot, learn, the, address, of, the, sender, or, recipient, from, the, envelope, and, occasionally, traditional, items, of, mail, may, fail, to, arrive, e, g, due, to, vandalism, to, mailboxes, unfriendly, pets, and, adverse, weather, conditions, mail, carriers, due, to, perceived, hazards, or, inconveniences, may, refuse, officially, or, otherwise, to, deliver, mail, to, a, particular, address, for, instance, if, there, is, no, clear, path, to, the, door, or, mailbox, on, the, other, hand, traditional, mail, avoids, the, possibility, of, computer, malfunctions, and, malware, and, the, recipient, does, not, need, to, print, it, out, if, they, wish, to, have, a, paper, copy, though, scanning, is, required, to, make, a, digital, copy, physical, mail, is, still, widely, used, in, business, and, personal, communications, for, such, reasons, as, legal, requirements, for, signatures, requirements, of, etiquette, and, the, requirement, to, enclose, small, physical, objects, since, the, advent, of, email, which, is, almost, always, much, faster, the, postal, system, has, come, to, be, referred, to, in, internet, slang, by, the, retronym,
