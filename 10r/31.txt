irrigation, also, referred, to, as, watering, of, plants, is, the, practice, of, applying, controlled, amounts, of, water, to, land, to, help, grow, crops, landscape, plants, and, lawns, irrigation, has, been, a, key, aspect, of, agriculture, for, over, 5, 000, years, and, has, been, developed, by, many, cultures, around, the, world, irrigation, helps, to, grow, crops, maintain, landscapes, and, revegetate, disturbed, soils, in, dry, areas, and, during, times, of, below, average, rainfall, in, addition, to, these, uses, irrigation, is, also, employed, to, protect, crops, from, frost, suppress, weed, growth, in, grain, fields, and, prevent, soil, consolidation, it, is, also, used, to, cool, livestock, reduce, dust, dispose, of, sewage, and, support, mining, operations, drainage, which, involves, the, removal, of, surface, and, sub, surface, water, from, a, given, location, is, often, studied, in, conjunction, with, irrigation, there, are, several, methods, of, irrigation, that, differ, in, how, water, is, supplied, to, plants, surface, irrigation, also, known, as, gravity, irrigation, is, the, oldest, form, of, irrigation, and, has, been, in, use, for, thousands, of, years, in, sprinkler, irrigation, water, is, piped, to, one, or, more, central, locations, within, the, field, and, distributed, by, overhead, high, pressure, water, devices, micro, irrigation, is, a, system, that, distributes, water, under, low, pressure, through, a, piped, network, and, applies, it, as, a, small, discharge, to, each, plant, micro, irrigation, uses, less, pressure, and, water, flow, than, sprinkler, irrigation, drip, irrigation, delivers, water, directly, to, the, root, zone, of, plants, subirrigation, has, been, used, in, field, crops, in, areas, with, high, water, tables, for, many, years, it, involves, artificially, raising, the, water, table, to, moisten, the, soil, below, the, root, zone, of, plants, irrigation, water, can, come, from, groundwater, extracted, from, springs, or, by, using, wells, from, surface, water, withdrawn, from, rivers, lakes, or, reservoirs, or, from, non, conventional, sources, like, treated, wastewater, desalinated, water, drainage, water, or, fog, collection, irrigation, can, be, supplementary, to, rainfall, which, is, common, in, many, parts, of, the, world, as, rainfed, agriculture, or, it, can, be, full, irrigation, where, crops, rarely, rely, on, any, contribution, from, rainfall, full, irrigation, is, less, common, and, only, occurs, in, arid, landscapes, with, very, low, rainfall, or, when, crops, are, grown, in, semi, arid, areas, outside, of, rainy, seasons, the, environmental, effects, of, irrigation, relate, to, the, changes, in, quantity, and, quality, of, soil, and, water, as, a, result, of, irrigation, and, the, subsequent, effects, on, natural, and, social, conditions, in, river, basins, and, downstream, of, an, irrigation, scheme, the, effects, stem, from, the, altered, hydrological, conditions, caused, by, the, installation, and, operation, of, the, irrigation, scheme, amongst, some, of, these, problems, is, depletion, of, underground, aquifers, through, overdrafting, soil, can, be, over, irrigated, due, to, poor, distribution, uniformity, or, management, wastes, water, chemicals, and, may, lead, to, water, pollution, over, irrigation, can, cause, deep, drainage, from, rising, water, tables, that, can, lead, to, problems, of, irrigation, salinity, requiring, watertable, control, by, some, form, of, subsurface, land, drainage, in, 2000, the, total, fertile, land, was, 2, 788, 000, km, 2, 689, million, acres, and, it, was, equipped, with, irrigation, infrastructure, worldwide, about, 68, of, this, area, is, in, asia, 17, in, the, americas, 9, in, europe, 5, in, africa, and, 1, in, oceania, the, largest, contiguous, areas, of, high, irrigation, density, are, found, in, northern, and, eastern, india, and, pakistan, along, the, ganges, and, indus, rivers, in, the, hai, he, huang, he, and, yangtze, basins, in, china, along, the, nile, river, in, egypt, and, sudan, and, in, the, mississippi, missouri, river, basin, the, southern, great, plains, and, in, parts, of, california, in, the, united, states, smaller, irrigation, areas, are, spread, across, almost, all, populated, parts, of, the, world, by, 2012, the, area, of, irrigated, land, had, increased, to, an, estimated, total, of, 3, 242, 917, km, 2, 801, million, acres, which, is, nearly, the, size, of, india, the, irrigation, of, 20, of, farming, land, accounts, for, the, production, of, 40, of, food, production, the, scale, of, irrigation, increased, dramatically, over, the, 20th, century, in, 1800, 8, million, hectares, globally, were, irrigated, in, 1950, 94, million, hectares, and, in, 1990, 235, million, hectares, by, 1990, 30, of, the, global, food, production, came, from, irrigated, land, irrigation, techniques, across, the, globe, includes, canals, redirecting, surface, water, groundwater, pumping, and, diverting, water, from, dams, national, governments, lead, most, irrigation, schemes, within, their, borders, but, private, investors, and, other, nations, especially, the, united, states, china, and, european, countries, like, the, united, kingdom, also, fund, and, organize, some, schemes, within, other, nations, by, 2021, the, global, land, area, equipped, for, irrigation, reached, 352, million, ha, an, increase, of, 22, from, the, 289, million, ha, of, 2000, and, more, than, twice, the, 1960s, land, area, equipped, for, irrigation, the, vast, majority, is, located, in, asia, 70, where, irrigation, was, a, key, component, of, the, green, revolution, the, americas, account, for, 16, and, europe, for, 8, of, the, world, total, india, 76, million, ha, and, china, 75, million, ha, have, the, largest, equipped, area, for, irrigation, far, ahead, of, the, united, states, o, famerica, 27, million, ha, china, and, india, also, have, the, largest, net, gains, in, equipped, area, between, 2000, and, 2020, 21, million, ha, for, china, and, 15, million, ha, for, india, all, the, regions, saw, increases, in, the, area, equipped, for, irrigation, with, africa, growing, the, fastest, 29, followed, by, asia, 25, oceania, 24, the, americas, 19, and, europe, 2, irrigation, enables, the, production, of, more, crops, especially, commodity, crops, in, areas, which, otherwise, could, not, support, them, countries, frequently, invested, in, irrigation, to, increase, wheat, rice, or, cotton, production, often, with, the, overarching, goal, of, increasing, self, sufficiency, irrigation, water, can, come, from, groundwater, extracted, from, springs, or, by, using, wells, from, surface, water, withdrawn, from, rivers, lakes, or, reservoirs, or, from, non, conventional, sources, like, treated, wastewater, desalinated, water, drainage, water, or, fog, collection, while, floodwater, harvesting, belongs, to, the, accepted, irrigation, methods, rainwater, harvesting, is, usually, not, considered, as, a, form, of, irrigation, rainwater, harvesting, is, the, collection, of, runoff, water, from, roofs, or, unused, land, and, the, concentration, of, this, irrigation, with, recycled, municipal, wastewater, can, also, serve, to, fertilize, plants, if, it, contains, nutrients, such, as, nitrogen, phosphorus, and, potassium, there, are, benefits, of, using, recycled, water, for, irrigation, including, the, lower, cost, compared, to, some, other, sources, and, consistency, of, supply, regardless, of, season, climatic, conditions, and, associated, water, restrictions, when, reclaimed, water, is, used, for, irrigation, in, agriculture, the, nutrient, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, content, of, the, treated, wastewater, has, the, benefit, of, acting, as, a, fertilizer, this, can, make, the, reuse, of, excreta, contained, in, sewage, attractive, in, developing, countries, agriculture, is, increasingly, using, untreated, municipal, wastewater, for, irrigation, often, in, an, unsafe, manner, cities, provide, lucrative, markets, for, fresh, produce, so, they, are, attractive, to, farmers, however, because, agriculture, has, to, compete, for, increasingly, scarce, water, resources, with, industry, and, municipal, users, there, is, often, no, alternative, for, farmers, but, to, use, water, polluted, with, urban, waste, directly, to, water, their, crops, there, can, be, significant, health, hazards, related, to, using, untreated, wastewater, in, agriculture, municipal, wastewater, can, contain, a, mixture, of, chemical, and, biological, pollutants, in, low, income, countries, there, are, often, high, levels, of, pathogens, from, excreta, in, emerging, nations, where, industrial, development, is, outpacing, environmental, regulation, there, are, increasing, risks, from, inorganic, and, organic, chemicals, the, world, health, organization, developed, guidelines, for, safe, use, of, wastewater, in, 2006, advocating, a, multiple, barrier, approach, wastewater, use, for, example, by, encouraging, farmers, to, adopt, various, risk, reducing, behaviors, these, include, ceasing, irrigation, a, few, days, before, harvesting, to, allow, pathogens, to, die, off, in, the, sunlight, applying, water, carefully, so, it, does, not, contaminate, leaves, likely, to, be, eaten, raw, cleaning, vegetables, with, disinfectant, or, allowing, fecal, sludge, used, in, farming, to, dry, before, being, used, as, a, human, manure, irrigation, water, can, also, come, from, non, conventional, sources, like, treated, wastewater, desalinated, water, drainage, water, or, fog, collection, in, countries, where, humid, air, sweeps, through, at, night, water, can, be, obtained, by, condensation, onto, cold, surfaces, this, is, practiced, in, the, vineyards, at, lanzarote, using, stones, to, condense, water, fog, collectors, are, also, made, of, canvas, or, foil, sheets, using, condensate, from, air, conditioning, units, as, a, water, source, is, also, becoming, more, popular, in, large, urban, areas, as, of, november, 2019, a, glasgow, based, startup, has, helped, a, farmer, in, scotland, to, establish, edible, saltmarsh, crops, irrigated, with, sea, water, an, acre, of, previously, marginal, land, has, been, put, under, cultivation, to, grow, samphire, sea, blite, and, sea, aster, these, plants, yield, a, higher, profit, than, potatoes, the, land, is, flood, irrigated, twice, a, day, to, simulate, tidal, flooding, the, water, is, pumped, from, the, sea, using, wind, power, additional, benefits, are, soil, remediation, and, carbon, sequestration, until, the, 1960s, there, were, fewer, than, half, the, number, of, people, on, the, planet, as, of, 2024, people, were, not, as, wealthy, as, today, consumed, fewer, calories, and, ate, less, meat, so, less, water, was, needed, to, produce, their, food, they, required, a, third, of, the, volume, of, water, humans, presently, take, from, rivers, today, the, competition, for, water, resources, is, much, more, intense, because, there, are, now, more, than, seven, billion, people, on, the, planet, increasing, the, likelihood, of, overconsumption, of, food, produced, by, water, thirsty, animal, agriculture, and, intensive, farming, practices, this, creates, increasing, competition, for, water, from, industry, urbanisation, and, biofuel, crops, farmers, will, have, to, strive, to, increase, productivity, to, meet, growing, demands, for, food, while, industry, and, cities, find, ways, to, use, water, more, efficiently, successful, agriculture, is, dependent, upon, farmers, having, sufficient, access, to, water, however, water, scarcity, is, already, a, critical, constraint, to, farming, in, many, parts, of, the, world, there, are, several, methods, of, irrigation, they, vary, in, how, the, water, is, supplied, to, the, plants, the, goal, is, to, apply, the, water, to, the, plants, as, uniformly, as, possible, so, that, each, plant, has, the, amount, of, water, it, needs, neither, too, much, nor, too, little, irrigation, can, also, be, understood, whether, it, is, supplementary, to, rainfall, as, happens, in, many, parts, of, the, world, or, whether, it, is, full, irrigation, whereby, crops, rarely, depend, on, any, contribution, from, rainfall, full, irrigation, is, less, common, and, only, happens, in, arid, landscapes, experiencing, very, low, rainfall, or, when, crops, are, grown, in, semi, arid, areas, outside, of, any, rainy, seasons, surface, irrigation, also, known, as, gravity, irrigation, is, the, oldest, form, of, irrigation, and, has, been, in, use, for, thousands, of, years, in, surface, furrow, flood, or, level, basin, irrigation, systems, water, moves, across, the, surface, of, agricultural, lands, in, order, to, wet, it, and, infiltrate, into, the, soil, water, moves, by, following, gravity, or, the, slope, of, the, land, surface, irrigation, can, be, subdivided, into, furrow, border, strip, or, basin, irrigation, it, is, often, called, flood, irrigation, when, the, irrigation, results, in, flooding, or, near, flooding, of, the, cultivated, land, historically, surface, irrigation, is, the, most, common, method, of, irrigating, agricultural, land, across, most, parts, of, the, world, the, water, application, efficiency, of, surface, irrigation, is, typically, lower, than, other, forms, of, irrigation, due, in, part, to, the, lack, of, control, of, applied, depths, surface, irrigation, involves, a, significantly, lower, capital, cost, and, energy, requirement, than, pressurised, irrigation, systems, hence, it, is, often, the, irrigation, choice, for, developing, nations, for, low, value, crops, and, for, large, fields, where, water, levels, from, the, irrigation, source, permit, the, levels, are, controlled, by, dikes, levees, usually, plugged, by, soil, this, is, often, seen, in, terraced, rice, fields, rice, paddies, where, the, method, is, used, to, flood, or, control, the, level, of, water, in, each, distinct, field, in, some, cases, the, water, is, pumped, or, lifted, by, human, or, animal, power, to, the, level, of, the, land, surface, irrigation, is, even, used, to, water, urban, gardens, in, certain, areas, for, example, in, and, around, phoenix, arizona, the, irrigated, area, is, surrounded, by, a, berm, and, the, water, is, delivered, according, to, a, schedule, set, by, a, local, irrigation, district, a, special, form, of, irrigation, using, surface, water, is, spate, irrigation, also, called, floodwater, harvesting, in, case, of, a, flood, spate, water, is, diverted, to, normally, dry, river, beds, wadis, using, a, network, of, dams, gates, and, channels, and, spread, over, large, areas, the, moisture, stored, in, the, soil, will, be, used, thereafter, to, grow, crops, spate, irrigation, areas, are, in, particular, located, in, semi, arid, or, arid, mountainous, regions, micro, irrigation, sometimes, called, localized, irrigation, low, volume, irrigation, or, trickle, irrigation, is, a, system, where, water, is, distributed, under, low, pressure, through, a, piped, network, in, a, pre, determined, pattern, and, applied, as, a, small, discharge, to, each, plant, or, adjacent, to, it, traditional, drip, irrigation, use, individual, emitters, subsurface, drip, irrigation, sdi, micro, spray, or, micro, sprinklers, and, mini, bubbler, irrigation, all, belong, to, this, category, of, irrigation, methods, drip, irrigation, also, known, as, microirrigation, or, trickle, irrigation, functions, as, its, name, suggests, in, this, system, water, is, delivered, at, or, near, the, root, zone, of, plants, one, drop, at, a, time, this, method, can, be, the, most, water, efficient, method, of, irrigation, if, managed, properly, evaporation, and, runoff, are, minimized, the, field, water, efficiency, of, drip, irrigation, is, typically, in, the, range, of, 80, to, 90, when, managed, correctly, in, modern, agriculture, drip, irrigation, is, often, combined, with, plastic, mulch, further, reducing, evaporation, and, is, also, the, means, of, delivery, of, fertilizer, the, process, is, known, as, fertigation, deep, percolation, where, water, moves, below, the, root, zone, can, occur, if, a, drip, system, is, operated, for, too, long, or, if, the, delivery, rate, is, too, high, drip, irrigation, methods, range, from, very, high, tech, and, computerized, to, low, tech, and, labor, intensive, lower, water, pressures, are, usually, needed, than, for, most, other, types, of, systems, with, the, exception, of, low, energy, center, pivot, systems, and, surface, irrigation, systems, and, the, system, can, be, designed, for, uniformity, throughout, a, field, or, for, precise, water, delivery, to, individual, plants, in, a, landscape, containing, a, mix, of, plant, species, although, it, is, difficult, to, regulate, pressure, on, steep, slopes, pressure, compensating, emitters, are, available, so, the, field, does, not, have, to, be, level, high, tech, solutions, involve, precisely, calibrated, emitters, located, along, lines, of, tubing, that, extend, from, a, computerized, set, of, valves, in, sprinkler, or, overhead, irrigation, water, is, piped, to, one, or, more, central, locations, within, the, field, and, distributed, by, overhead, high, pressure, sprinklers, or, guns, a, system, using, sprinklers, sprays, or, guns, mounted, overhead, on, permanently, installed, risers, is, often, referred, to, as, a, solid, set, irrigation, system, higher, pressure, sprinklers, that, rotate, are, called, rotors, and, are, driven, by, a, ball, drive, gear, drive, or, impact, mechanism, rotors, can, be, designed, to, rotate, in, a, full, or, partial, circle, guns, are, similar, to, rotors, except, that, they, generally, operate, at, very, high, pressures, of, 275, to, 900, kpa, 40, to, 130, psi, and, flows, of, 3, to, 76, l, s, 50, to, 1200, us, gal, min, usually, with, nozzle, diameters, in, the, range, of, 10, to, 50, mm, 0, 5, to, 1, 9, in, guns, are, used, not, only, for, irrigation, but, also, for, industrial, applications, such, as, dust, suppression, and, logging, sprinklers, can, also, be, mounted, on, moving, platforms, connected, to, the, water, source, by, a, hose, automatically, moving, wheeled, systems, known, as, traveling, sprinklers, may, irrigate, areas, such, as, small, farms, sports, fields, parks, pastures, and, cemeteries, unattended, most, of, these, use, a, length, of, polyethylene, tubing, wound, on, a, steel, drum, as, the, tubing, is, wound, on, the, drum, powered, by, the, irrigation, water, or, a, small, gas, engine, the, sprinkler, is, pulled, across, the, field, when, the, sprinkler, arrives, back, at, the, reel, the, system, shuts, off, this, type, of, system, is, known, to, most, people, as, a, waterreel, traveling, irrigation, sprinkler, and, they, are, used, extensively, for, dust, suppression, irrigation, and, land, application, of, waste, water, other, travelers, use, a, flat, rubber, hose, that, is, dragged, along, behind, while, the, sprinkler, platform, is, pulled, by, a, cable, center, pivot, irrigation, is, a, form, of, sprinkler, irrigation, utilising, several, segments, of, pipe, usually, galvanized, steel, or, aluminium, joined, and, supported, by, trusses, mounted, on, wheeled, towers, with, sprinklers, positioned, along, its, length, the, system, moves, in, a, circular, pattern, and, is, fed, with, water, from, the, pivot, point, at, the, center, of, the, arc, these, systems, are, found, and, used, in, all, parts, of, the, world, and, allow, irrigation, of, all, types, of, terrain, newer, systems, have, drop, sprinkler, heads, as, shown, in, the, image, that, follows, as, of, 2017, most, center, pivot, systems, have, drops, hanging, from, a, u, shaped, pipe, attached, at, the, top, of, the, pipe, with, sprinkler, heads, that, are, positioned, a, few, feet, at, most, above, the, crop, thus, limiting, evaporative, losses, drops, can, also, be, used, with, drag, hoses, or, bubblers, that, deposit, the, water, directly, on, the, ground, between, crops, crops, are, often, planted, in, a, circle, to, conform, to, the, center, pivot, this, type, of, system, is, known, as, lepa, low, energy, precision, application, originally, most, center, pivots, were, water, powered, these, were, replaced, by, hydraulic, systems, t, l, irrigation, and, electric, motor, driven, systems, reinke, valley, zimmatic, many, modern, pivots, feature, gps, devices, a, series, of, pipes, each, with, a, wheel, of, about, 1, 5, m, diameter, permanently, affixed, to, its, midpoint, and, sprinklers, along, its, length, are, coupled, together, water, is, supplied, at, one, end, using, a, large, hose, after, sufficient, irrigation, has, been, applied, to, one, strip, of, the, field, the, hose, is, removed, the, water, drained, from, the, system, and, the, assembly, rolled, either, by, hand, or, with, a, purpose, built, mechanism, so, that, the, sprinklers, are, moved, to, a, different, position, across, the, field, the, hose, is, reconnected, the, process, is, repeated, in, a, pattern, until, the, whole, field, has, been, irrigated, this, system, is, less, expensive, to, install, than, a, center, pivot, but, much, more, labor, intensive, to, operate, it, does, not, travel, automatically, across, the, field, it, applies, water, in, a, stationary, strip, must, be, drained, and, then, rolled, to, a, new, strip, most, systems, use, 100, or, 130, mm, 4, or, 5, inch, diameter, aluminum, pipe, the, pipe, doubles, both, as, water, transport, and, as, an, axle, for, rotating, all, the, wheels, a, drive, system, often, found, near, the, centre, of, the, wheel, line, rotates, the, clamped, together, pipe, sections, as, a, single, axle, rolling, the, whole, wheel, line, manual, adjustment, of, individual, wheel, positions, may, be, necessary, if, the, system, becomes, misaligned, wheel, line, systems, are, limited, in, the, amount, of, water, they, can, carry, and, limited, in, the, height, of, crops, that, can, be, irrigated, one, useful, feature, of, a, lateral, move, system, is, that, it, consists, of, sections, that, can, be, easily, disconnected, adapting, to, field, shape, as, the, line, is, moved, they, are, most, often, used, for, small, rectilinear, or, oddly, shaped, fields, hilly, or, mountainous, regions, or, in, regions, where, labor, is, inexpensive, a, lawn, sprinkler, system, is, permanently, installed, as, opposed, to, a, hose, end, sprinkler, which, is, portable, sprinkler, systems, are, installed, in, residential, lawns, in, commercial, landscapes, for, churches, and, schools, in, public, parks, and, cemeteries, and, on, golf, courses, most, of, the, components, of, these, irrigation, systems, are, hidden, under, ground, since, aesthetics, are, important, in, a, landscape, a, typical, lawn, sprinkler, system, will, consist, of, one, or, more, zones, limited, in, size, by, the, capacity, of, the, water, source, each, zone, will, cover, a, designated, portion, of, the, landscape, sections, of, the, landscape, will, usually, be, divided, by, microclimate, type, of, plant, material, and, type, of, irrigation, equipment, a, landscape, irrigation, system, may, also, include, zones, containing, drip, irrigation, bubblers, or, other, types, of, equipment, besides, sprinklers, although, manual, systems, are, still, used, most, lawn, sprinkler, systems, may, be, operated, automatically, using, an, irrigation, controller, sometimes, called, a, clock, or, timer, most, automatic, systems, employ, electric, solenoid, valves, each, zone, has, one, or, more, of, these, valves, that, are, wired, to, the, controller, when, the, controller, sends, power, to, the, valve, the, valve, opens, allowing, water, to, flow, to, the, sprinklers, in, that, zone, there, are, two, main, types, of, sprinklers, used, in, lawn, irrigation, pop, up, spray, heads, and, rotors, spray, heads, have, a, fixed, spray, pattern, while, rotors, have, one, or, more, streams, that, rotate, spray, heads, are, used, to, cover, smaller, areas, while, rotors, are, used, for, larger, areas, golf, course, rotors, are, sometimes, so, large, that, a, single, sprinkler, is, combined, with, a, valve, and, called, a, valve, in, head, when, used, in, a, turf, area, the, sprinklers, are, installed, with, the, top, of, the, head, flush, with, the, ground, surface, when, the, system, is, pressurized, the, head, will, pop, up, out, of, the, ground, and, water, the, desired, area, until, the, valve, closes, and, shuts, off, that, zone, once, there, is, no, more, pressure, in, the, lateral, line, the, sprinkler, head, will, retract, back, into, the, ground, in, flower, beds, or, shrub, areas, sprinklers, may, be, mounted, on, above, ground, risers, or, even, taller, pop, up, sprinklers, may, be, used, and, installed, flush, as, in, a, lawn, area, there, are, many, types, of, hose, end, sprinklers, many, of, them, are, smaller, versions, of, larger, agricultural, and, landscape, sprinklers, sized, to, work, with, a, typical, garden, hose, some, have, a, spiked, base, allowing, them, to, be, temporarily, stuck, in, the, ground, while, others, have, a, sled, base, designed, to, be, dragged, while, attached, to, the, hose, subirrigation, has, been, used, for, many, years, in, field, crops, in, areas, with, high, water, tables, it, is, a, method, of, artificially, raising, the, water, table, to, allow, the, soil, to, be, moistened, from, below, the, plants, root, zone, often, those, systems, are, located, on, permanent, grasslands, in, lowlands, or, river, valleys, and, combined, with, drainage, infrastructure, a, system, of, pumping, stations, canals, weirs, and, gates, allows, it, to, increase, or, decrease, the, water, level, in, a, network, of, ditches, and, thereby, control, the, water, table, subirrigation, is, also, used, in, the, commercial, greenhouse, production, usually, for, potted, plants, water, is, delivered, from, below, absorbed, by, upwards, and, the, excess, collected, for, recycling, typically, a, solution, of, water, and, nutrients, floods, a, container, or, flows, through, a, trough, for, a, short, period, of, time, 10, 20, minutes, and, is, then, pumped, back, into, a, holding, tank, for, reuse, sub, irrigation, in, greenhouses, requires, fairly, sophisticated, expensive, equipment, and, management, advantages, are, water, and, nutrient, conservation, and, labor, savings, through, reduced, system, maintenance, and, automation, it, is, similar, in, principle, and, action, to, subsurface, basin, irrigation, another, type, of, subirrigation, is, the, self, watering, container, also, known, as, a, sub, irrigated, planter, this, consists, of, a, planter, suspended, over, a, reservoir, with, some, type, of, wicking, material, such, as, a, polyester, rope, the, water, is, drawn, up, the, wick, through, capillary, action, a, similar, technique, is, the, wicking, bed, this, too, uses, capillary, action, modern, irrigation, methods, are, efficient, enough, to, supply, the, entire, field, uniformly, with, water, so, that, each, plant, has, the, amount, of, water, it, needs, neither, too, much, nor, too, little, water, use, efficiency, in, the, field, can, be, determined, as, follows, increased, irrigation, efficiency, has, a, number, of, positive, outcomes, for, the, farmer, the, community, and, the, wider, environment, low, application, efficiency, infers, that, the, amount, of, water, applied, to, the, field, is, in, excess, of, the, crop, or, field, requirements, increasing, the, application, efficiency, means, that, the, amount, of, crop, produced, per, unit, of, water, increases, improved, efficiency, may, either, be, achieved, by, applying, less, water, to, an, existing, field, or, by, using, water, more, wisely, thereby, achieving, higher, yields, in, the, same, area, of, land, in, some, parts, of, the, world, farmers, are, charged, for, irrigation, water, hence, over, application, has, a, direct, financial, cost, to, the, farmer, irrigation, often, requires, pumping, energy, either, electricity, or, fossil, fuel, to, deliver, water, to, the, field, or, supply, the, correct, operating, pressure, hence, increased, efficiency, will, reduce, both, the, water, cost, and, energy, cost, per, unit, of, agricultural, production, a, reduction, of, water, use, on, one, field, may, mean, that, the, farmer, is, able, to, irrigate, a, larger, area, of, land, increasing, total, agricultural, production, low, efficiency, usually, means, that, excess, water, is, lost, through, seepage, or, runoff, both, of, which, can, result, in, loss, of, crop, nutrients, or, pesticides, with, potential, adverse, impacts, on, the, surrounding, environment, improving, the, efficiency, of, irrigation, is, usually, achieved, in, one, of, two, ways, either, by, improving, the, system, design, or, by, optimising, the, irrigation, management, improving, system, design, includes, conversion, from, one, form, of, irrigation, to, another, e, g, from, furrow, to, drip, irrigation, and, also, through, small, changes, in, the, current, system, for, example, changing, flowrates, and, operating, pressures, irrigation, management, refers, to, the, scheduling, of, irrigation, events, and, decisions, around, how, much, water, is, applied, negative, impacts, frequently, accompany, extensive, irrigation, some, projects, which, diverted, surface, water, for, irrigation, dried, up, the, water, sources, which, led, to, a, more, extreme, regional, climate, projects, that, relied, on, groundwater, and, pumped, too, much, from, underground, aquifers, created, subsidence, and, salinization, salinization, of, irrigation, water, in, turn, damaged, the, crops, and, seeped, into, drinking, water, pests, and, pathogens, also, thrived, in, the, irrigation, canals, or, ponds, full, of, still, water, which, created, regional, outbreaks, of, diseases, like, malaria, and, schistosomiasis, governments, also, used, irrigation, schemes, to, encourage, migration, especially, of, more, desirable, populations, into, an, area, additionally, some, of, these, large, nationwide, schemes, failed, to, pay, off, at, all, costing, more, than, any, benefit, gained, from, increased, crop, yields, overdrafting, depletion, of, underground, aquifers, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, advent, of, diesel, and, electric, motors, led, to, systems, that, could, pump, groundwater, out, of, major, aquifers, faster, than, drainage, basins, could, refill, them, this, can, lead, to, permanent, loss, of, aquifer, capacity, decreased, water, quality, ground, subsidence, and, other, problems, the, future, of, food, production, in, such, areas, as, the, north, china, plain, the, punjab, region, in, india, and, pakistan, and, the, great, plains, of, the, us, is, threatened, by, this, phenomenon, the, environmental, impact, of, irrigation, relates, to, the, changes, in, quantity, and, quality, of, soil, and, water, as, a, result, of, irrigation, and, the, subsequent, effects, on, natural, and, social, conditions, in, river, basins, and, downstream, of, an, irrigation, scheme, the, effects, stem, from, the, altered, hydrological, conditions, caused, by, the, installation, and, operation, of, the, irrigation, scheme, irrigation, schemes, involve, solving, numerous, engineering, and, economic, problems, while, minimizing, negative, environmental, consequences, such, problems, include, archaeological, investigation, has, found, evidence, of, irrigation, in, areas, lacking, sufficient, natural, rainfall, to, support, crops, for, rainfed, agriculture, some, of, the, earliest, known, use, of, the, technology, dates, to, the, 6th, millennium, bce, in, khuzistan, in, the, south, west, of, iran, the, site, of, choga, mami, in, present, day, iraq, on, the, border, with, iran, is, believed, to, be, the, earliest, to, show, the, first, canal, irrigation, in, operation, at, about, 6000, bce, irrigation, was, used, as, a, means, of, manipulation, of, water, in, the, alluvial, plains, of, the, indus, valley,

two, thirds, of, this, irrigation, sources, from, groundwater, or, small, ponds, and, reservoirs, while, the, other, one, third, comes, from, large, dams, one, of, the, main, attractions, of, irrigation, in, the, west, was, its, increased, dependability, compared, to, rainfall, watered, agriculture, in, the, east, proponents, argued, that, farmers, with, a, dependable, water, supply, could, more, easily, get, loans, from, bankers, interested, in, this, more, predictable, farming, model, most, irrigation, in, the, great, plains, region, derived, from, underground, aquifers, euro, american, farmers, who, colonized, the, region, in, the, 19th, century, tried, to, grow, the, commodity, crops, that, they, were, used, to, like, wheat, corn, and, alfalfa, but, rainfall, stifled, their, growing, capacity, between, the, late, 1800s, and, the, 1930s, farmers, used, wind, powered, pumps, to, draw, groundwater, these, windpumps, had, limited, power, but, the, development, of, gas, powered, pumps, in, the, mid, 1930s, pushed, wells, deep, into, the, ogallala, aquifer, farmers, irrigated, fields, by, laying, pipes, across, the, field, with, sprinklers, at, intervals, a, labor, intensive, process, until, the, advent, of, the, center, pivot, sprinkler, after, wwii, which, made, irrigation, significantly, easier, by, the, 1970s, farmers, drained, the, aquifer, ten, times, faster, than, it, could, recharge, and, by, 1993, they, had, removed, half, of, the, accessible, water, large, scale, federal, funding, and, intervention, pushed, through, the, majority, of, irrigation, projects, in, the, west, especially, in, california, colorado, arizona, and, nevada, at, first, plans, to, increase, irrigated, farmland, largely, by, giving, land, to, farmers, and, asking, them, to, find, water, failed, across, the, board, congress, passed, the, desert, land, act, in, 1877, and, the, carey, act, in, 1894, which, only, marginally, increased, irrigation, only, in, 1902, did, congress, pass, the, national, reclamation, act, which, channeled, money, from, the, sale, of, western, public, lands, in, parcels, up, to, 160, acres, large, into, irrigation, projects, on, public, or, private, land, in, the, arid, west, the, congressmen, who, passed, the, law, and, their, wealthy, supporters, supported, western, irrigation, because, it, would, increase, american, exports, reclaim, the, west, and, push, the, eastern, poor, out, west, for, a, better, life, while, the, national, reclamation, act, was, the, most, successful, piece, of, federal, irrigation, legislation, the, implementation, of, the, act, did, not, go, as, planned, the, reclamation, service, chose, to, push, most, of, the, act, s, money, toward, construction, rather, than, settlement, so, the, service, overwhelmingly, prioritized, building, large, dams, like, the, hoover, dam, over, the, 20th, century, congress, and, state, governments, grew, more, frustrated, with, the, reclamation, service, and, the, irrigation, schemes, frederick, newell, head, of, the, reclamation, service, proving, uncompromising, and, challenging, to, work, with, falling, crop, prices, resistance, to, delay, debt, payments, and, refusal, to, begin, new, projects, until, the, completion, of, old, ones, all, contributed, the, reclamation, extension, act, of, 1914, transferring, a, significant, amount, of, irrigation, decision, making, power, regarding, irrigation, projects, from, the, reclamation, service, to, congress, was, in, many, ways, a, result, of, increasing, political, unpopularity, of, the, reclamation, service, in, the, lower, colorado, basin, of, arizona, colorado, and, nevada, the, states, derive, irrigation, water, largely, from, rivers, especially, the, colorado, river, which,

when, the, bolsheviks, conquered, central, asia, in, 1917, the, native, kazakhs, uzbeks, and, turkmens, used, minimal, irrigation, the, slavic, immigrants, pushed, into, the, area, by, the, tsarist, government, brought, their, irrigation, methods, including, waterwheels, the, use, of, rice, paddies, to, restore, salted, land, and, underground, irrigation, channels, russians, dismissed, these, techniques, as, crude, and, inefficient, despite, this, tsarist, officials, maintained, these, systems, through, the, late, 19th, century, without, other, solutions, before, conquering, the, area, the, russian, government, accepted, a, 1911, american, proposal, to, send, hydraulic, experts, to, central, asia, to, investigate, the, potential, for, large, scale, irrigation, a, 1918, decree, by, lenin, then, encouraged, irrigation, development, in, the, region, which, began, in, the, 1930s, when, it, did, stalin, and, other, soviet, leaders, prioritized, large, scale, ambitious, hydraulic, projects, especially, along, the, volga, river, the, soviet, irrigation, push, stemmed, mainly, from, their, late, 19th, century, fears, of, the, american, cotton, monopoly, and, subsequent, desire, to, achieve, cotton, self, sufficiency, they, had, built, up, their, textile, manufacturing, industry, in, the, 19th, century, requiring, increased, cotton, and, irrigation, as, the, region, did, not, receive, enough, rainfall, to, support, cotton, farming, the, russians, built, dams, on, the, don, and, kuban, rivers, for, irrigation, removing, freshwater, flow, from, the, sea, of, azov, and, making, it, much, saltier, depletion, and, salinization, scourged, other, areas, of, the, russian, irrigation, project, in, the, 1950s, soviet, officials, began, also, diverting, the, syr, darya, and, the, amu, darya, which, fed, the, aral, sea, before, diversion, the, rivers, delivered, 55km3, of, water, to, the, aral, sea, per, year, but, after, they, only, delivered, 6km3, to, the, sea, because, of, its, reduced, inflow, the, aral, sea, covered, less, than, half, of, its, original, seabed, which, made, the, regional, climate, more, extreme, and, created, airborne, salinization, lowering, nearby, crop, yields, by, 1975, the, ussr, used, eight, times, as, much, water, as, they, had, in, 1913, mostly, for, irrigation, russia, s, expansion, of, irrigation, began, to, decrease, in, the, late, 1980s, and, irrigated, hectares, in, central, asia, capped, out, at, 7, million, mikhail, gorbachev, killed, a, proposed, plan, to, reverse, the, ob, and, yenisei, for, irrigation, in, 1986,

man, made, river, to, deliver, the, saharan, water, to, the, coast, the, water, largely, contributed, to, irrigation, but, cost, four, to, ten, times, more, than, the, crops, it, produced, were, worth, in, 1912, the, union, of, south, africa, created, an, irrigation, department, and, began, investing, in, water, storage, infrastructure, and, irrigation, the, government, used, irrigation, and, dam, building, to, further, social, goals, like, poverty, relief, by, creating, construction, jobs, for, poor, whites, and, by, creating, irrigation, schemes, to, increase, white, farming, one, of, their, first, significant, irrigation, projects, was, the, hartbeespoort, dam, begun, in, 1916, to, elevate, the, living, conditions, of, the, poor, whites, in, the, region, and, eventually, completed, as, a, whites, only, employment, opportunity, the, pretoria, irrigation, scheme, kammanassie, project, and, buchuberg, irrigation, scheme, on, the, orange, river, all, followed, in, the, same, vein, in, the, 1920s, and, 30s, in, egypt, modern, irrigation, began, with, muhammad, ali, pasha, in, the, mid, 1800s, who, sought, to, achieve, egyptian, independence, from, the, ottomans, through, increased, trade, with, europe, specifically, cotton, exportation, his, administration, proposed, replacing, the, traditional, nile, basin, irrigation, which, took, advantage, of, the, annual, ebb, and, flow, of, the, nile, with, irrigation, barrages, in, the, lower, nile, which, better, suited, cotton, production, egypt, devoted, 105, 000, ha, to, cotton, in, 1861, which, increased, fivefold, by, 1865, most, of, their, exports, were, shipped, to, england, and, the, united, states, civil, war, induced, cotton, scarcity, in, the, 1860s, cemented, egypt, as, england, s, cotton, producer, as, the, egyptian, economy, became, more, dependent, on, cotton, in, the, 20th, century, controlling, even, small, nile, floods, became, more, important, cotton, production, was,
