photographic, film, is, a, strip, or, sheet, of, transparent, film, base, coated, on, one, side, with, a, gelatin, emulsion, containing, microscopically, small, light, sensitive, silver, halide, crystals, the, sizes, and, other, characteristics, of, the, crystals, determine, the, sensitivity, contrast, and, resolution, of, the, film, film, is, typically, segmented, in, frames, that, give, rise, to, separate, photographs, the, emulsion, will, gradually, darken, if, left, exposed, to, light, but, the, process, is, too, slow, and, incomplete, to, be, of, any, practical, use, instead, a, very, short, exposure, to, the, image, formed, by, a, camera, lens, is, used, to, produce, only, a, very, slight, chemical, change, proportional, to, the, amount, of, light, absorbed, by, each, crystal, this, creates, an, invisible, latent, image, in, the, emulsion, which, can, be, chemically, developed, into, a, visible, photograph, in, addition, to, visible, light, all, films, are, sensitive, to, ultraviolet, light, x, rays, gamma, rays, and, high, energy, particles, unmodified, silver, halide, crystals, are, sensitive, only, to, the, blue, part, of, the, visible, spectrum, producing, unnatural, looking, renditions, of, some, colored, subjects, this, problem, was, resolved, with, the, discovery, that, certain, dyes, called, sensitizing, dyes, when, adsorbed, onto, the, silver, halide, crystals, made, them, respond, to, other, colors, as, well, first, orthochromatic, sensitive, to, blue, and, green, and, finally, panchromatic, sensitive, to, all, visible, colors, films, were, developed, panchromatic, film, renders, all, colors, in, shades, of, gray, approximately, matching, their, subjective, brightness, by, similar, techniques, special, purpose, films, can, be, made, sensitive, to, the, infrared, ir, region, of, the, spectrum, in, black, and, white, photographic, film, there, is, usually, one, layer, of, silver, halide, crystals, when, the, exposed, silver, halide, grains, are, developed, the, silver, halide, crystals, are, converted, to, metallic, silver, which, blocks, light, and, appears, as, the, black, part, of, the, film, negative, color, film, has, at, least, three, sensitive, layers, incorporating, different, combinations, of, sensitizing, dyes, typically, the, blue, sensitive, layer, is, on, top, followed, by, a, yellow, filter, layer, to, stop, any, remaining, blue, light, from, affecting, the, layers, below, next, comes, a, green, and, blue, sensitive, layer, and, a, red, and, blue, sensitive, layer, which, record, the, green, and, red, images, respectively, during, development, the, exposed, silver, halide, crystals, are, converted, to, metallic, silver, just, as, with, black, and, white, film, but, in, a, color, film, the, by, products, of, the, development, reaction, simultaneously, combine, with, chemicals, known, as, color, couplers, that, are, included, either, in, the, film, itself, or, in, the, developer, solution, to, form, colored, dyes, because, the, by, products, are, created, in, direct, proportion, to, the, amount, of, exposure, and, development, the, dye, clouds, formed, are, also, in, proportion, to, the, exposure, and, development, following, development, the, silver, is, converted, back, to, silver, halide, crystals, in, the, bleach, step, it, is, removed, from, the, film, during, the, process, of, fixing, the, image, on, the, film, with, a, solution, of, ammonium, thiosulfate, or, sodium, thiosulfate, hypo, or, fixer, fixing, leaves, behind, only, the, formed, color, dyes, which, combine, to, make, up, the, colored, visible, image, later, color, films, like, kodacolor, ii, have, as, many, as, 12, emulsion, layers, with, upwards, of, 20, different, chemicals, in, each, layer, photographic, film, and, film, stock, tend, to, be, similar, in, composition, and, speed, but, often, not, in, other, parameters, such, as, frame, size, and, length, silver, halide, photographic, paper, is, also, similar, to, photographic, film, there, are, several, types, of, photographic, film, including, in, order, to, produce, a, usable, image, the, film, needs, to, be, exposed, properly, the, amount, of, exposure, variation, that, a, given, film, can, tolerate, while, still, producing, an, acceptable, level, of, quality, is, called, its, exposure, latitude, color, print, film, generally, has, greater, exposure, latitude, than, other, types, of, film, additionally, because, print, film, must, be, printed, to, be, viewed, after, the, fact, corrections, for, imperfect, exposure, are, possible, during, the, printing, process, the, concentration, of, dyes, or, silver, halide, crystals, remaining, on, the, film, after, development, is, referred, to, as, optical, density, or, simply, density, the, optical, density, is, proportional, to, the, logarithm, of, the, optical, transmission, coefficient, of, the, developed, film, a, dark, image, on, the, negative, is, of, higher, density, than, a, more, transparent, image, most, films, are, affected, by, the, physics, of, silver, grain, activation, which, sets, a, minimum, amount, of, light, required, to, expose, a, single, grain, and, by, the, statistics, of, random, grain, activation, by, photons, the, film, requires, a, minimum, amount, of, light, before, it, begins, to, expose, and, then, responds, by, progressive, darkening, over, a, wide, dynamic, range, of, exposure, until, all, of, the, grains, are, exposed, and, the, film, achieves, after, development, its, maximum, optical, density, over, the, active, dynamic, range, of, most, films, the, density, of, the, developed, film, is, proportional, to, the, logarithm, of, the, total, amount, of, light, to, which, the, film, was, exposed, so, the, transmission, coefficient, of, the, developed, film, is, proportional, to, a, power, of, the, reciprocal, of, the, brightness, of, the, original, exposure, the, plot, of, the, density, of, the, film, image, against, the, log, of, the, exposure, is, known, as, an, h, d, curve, this, effect, is, due, to, the, statistics, of, grain, activation, as, the, film, becomes, progressively, more, exposed, each, incident, photon, is, less, likely, to, impact, a, still, unexposed, grain, yielding, the, logarithmic, behavior, a, simple, idealized, statistical, model, yields, the, equation, density, 1, 1, k, light, where, light, is, proportional, to, the, number, of, photons, hitting, a, unit, area, of, film, k, is, the, probability, of, a, single, photon, striking, a, grain, based, on, the, size, of, the, grains, and, how, closely, spaced, they, are, and, density, is, the, proportion, of, grains, that, have, been, hit, by, at, least, one, photon, the, relationship, between, density, and, log, exposure, is, linear, for, photographic, films, except, at, the, extreme, ranges, of, maximum, exposure, d, max, and, minimum, exposure, d, min, on, an, h, d, curve, so, the, curve, is, characteristically, s, shaped, as, opposed, to, digital, camera, sensors, which, have, a, linear, response, through, the, effective, exposure, range, the, sensitivity, i, e, the, iso, speed, of, a, film, can, be, affected, by, changing, the, length, or, temperature, of, development, which, would, move, the, h, d, curve, to, the, left, or, right, see, figure, if, parts, of, the, image, are, exposed, heavily, enough, to, approach, the, maximum, density, possible, for, a, print, film, then, they, will, begin, losing, the, ability, to, show, tonal, variations, in, the, final, print, usually, those, areas, will, be, considered, overexposed, and, will, appear, as, featureless, white, on, the, print, some, subject, matter, is, tolerant, of, very, heavy, exposure, for, example, sources, of, brilliant, light, such, as, a, light, bulb, or, the, sun, generally, appear, best, as, a, featureless, white, on, the, print, likewise, if, part, of, an, image, receives, less, than, the, beginning, threshold, level, of, exposure, which, depends, upon, the, film, s, sensitivity, to, light, or, speed, the, film, there, will, have, no, appreciable, image, density, and, will, appear, on, the, print, as, a, featureless, black, some, photographers, use, their, knowledge, of, these, limits, to, determine, the, optimum, exposure, for, a, photograph, for, one, example, see, the, zone, system, most, automatic, cameras, instead, try, to, achieve, a, particular, average, density, color, films, can, have, many, layers, the, film, base, can, have, an, antihalation, layer, applied, to, it, or, be, dyed, this, layer, prevents, light, from, reflecting, from, within, the, film, increasing, image, quality, this, also, can, make, films, exposable, on, only, one, side, as, it, prevents, exposure, from, behind, the, film, this, layer, is, bleached, after, development, to, make, it, clear, thus, making, the, film, transparent, the, antihalation, layer, besides, having, a, black, colloidal, silver, sol, pigment, for, absorbing, light, can, also, have, two, uv, absorbents, to, improve, lightfastness, of, the, developed, image, an, oxidized, developer, scavenger, dyes, for, compensating, for, optical, density, during, printing, solvents, gelatin, and, disodium, salt, of, 3, 5, disulfocatechol, if, applied, to, the, back, of, the, film, it, also, serves, to, prevent, scratching, as, an, antistatic, measure, due, to, its, conductive, carbon, content, and, as, a, lubricant, to, help, transport, the, film, through, mechanisms, the, antistatic, property, is, necessary, to, prevent, the, film, from, getting, fogged, under, low, humidity, and, mechanisms, to, avoid, static, are, present, in, most, if, not, all, films, if, applied, on, the, back, it, is, removed, during, film, processing, if, applied, it, may, be, on, the, back, of, the, film, base, in, triacetate, film, bases, or, in, the, front, in, pet, film, bases, below, the, emulsion, stack, an, anticurl, layer, and, a, separate, antistatic, layer, may, be, present, in, thin, high, resolution, films, that, have, the, antihalation, layer, below, the, emulsion, pet, film, bases, are, often, dyed, specially, because, pet, can, serve, as, a, light, pipe, black, and, white, film, bases, tend, to, have, a, higher, level, of, dying, applied, to, them, the, film, base, needs, to, be, transparent, but, with, some, density, perfectly, flat, insensitive, to, light, chemically, stable, resistant, to, tearing, and, strong, enough, to, be, handled, manually, and, by, camera, mechanisms, and, film, processing, equipment, while, being, chemically, resistant, to, moisture, and, the, chemicals, used, during, processing, without, losing, strength, flexibility, or, changing, in, size, the, subbing, layer, is, essentially, an, adhesive, that, allows, the, subsequent, layers, to, stick, to, the, film, base, the, film, base, was, initially, made, of, highly, flammable, cellulose, nitrate, which, was, replaced, by, cellulose, acetate, films, often, cellulose, triacetate, film, safety, film, which, in, turn, was, replaced, in, many, films, such, as, all, print, films, most, duplication, films, and, some, other, specialty, films, by, a, pet, polyethylene, terephthalate, plastic, film, base, films, with, a, triacetate, base, can, suffer, from, vinegar, syndrome, a, decomposition, process, accelerated, by, warm, and, humid, conditions, that, releases, acetic, acid, which, is, the, characteristic, component, of, vinegar, imparting, the, film, a, strong, vinegar, smell, accelerating, damage, within, the, film, and, possibly, even, damaging, surrounding, metal, and, films, films, are, usually, spliced, using, a, special, adhesive, tape, those, with, pet, layers, can, be, ultrasonically, spliced, or, their, ends, melted, and, then, spliced, the, emulsion, layers, of, films, are, made, by, dissolving, pure, silver, in, nitric, acid, to, form, silver, nitrate, crystals, which, are, mixed, with, other, chemicals, to, form, silver, halide, grains, which, are, then, suspended, in, gelatin, and, applied, to, the, film, base, the, size, and, hence, the, light, sensitivity, of, these, grains, determines, the, speed, of, the, film, since, films, contain, real, silver, as, silver, halide, faster, films, with, larger, crystals, are, more, expensive, and, potentially, subject, to, variations, in, the, price, of, silver, metal, also, faster, films, have, more, grain, since, the, grains, crystals, are, larger, each, crystal, is, often, 0, 2, to, 2, microns, in, size, in, color, films, the, dye, clouds, that, form, around, the, silver, halide, crystals, are, often, 25, microns, across, the, crystals, can, be, shaped, as, cubes, flat, rectangles, tetradecadedra, or, be, flat, and, resemble, a, triangle, with, or, without, clipped, edges, this, type, of, crystal, is, known, as, a, t, grain, crystal, or, a, tabular, grain, t, grains, films, using, t, grains, are, more, sensitive, to, light, without, using, more, silver, halide, since, they, increase, the, surface, area, exposed, to, light, by, making, the, crystals, flatter, and, larger, in, footprint, instead, of, simply, increasing, their, volume, t, grains, can, also, have, a, hexagonal, shape, these, grains, also, have, reduced, sensitivity, to, blue, light, which, is, an, advantage, since, silver, halide, is, most, sensitive, to, blue, light, than, other, colors, of, light, this, was, traditionally, solved, by, the, addition, of, a, blue, blocking, filter, layer, in, the, film, emulsion, but, t, grains, have, allowed, this, layer, to, be, removed, also, the, grains, may, have, a, core, and, shell, where, the, core, made, of, silver, iodobromide, has, higher, iodine, content, than, the, shell, which, improves, light, sensitivity, these, grains, are, known, as, grains, the, exact, silver, halide, used, is, either, silver, bromide, or, silver, bromochloroiodide, or, a, combination, of, silver, bromide, chloride, and, iodide, silver, iodobromide, may, be, used, as, a, silver, halide, silver, halide, crystals, can, be, made, in, several, shapes, for, use, in, photographic, films, for, example, agbrcl, hexagonal, tabular, grains, can, be, used, for, color, negative, films, agbr, octahedral, grains, can, be, used, for, instant, color, photography, films, agbrl, cubo, octahedral, grains, can, be, used, for, color, reversal, films, agbr, hexagonal, tabular, grains, can, be, used, for, medical, x, ray, films, and, agbrcl, cubic, grains, can, be, used, for, graphic, arts, films, in, color, films, each, emulsion, layer, has, silver, halide, crystals, that, are, sensitized, to, one, particular, color, wavelength, of, light, v, a, sentizing, dyes, to, that, they, will, be, made, sensitive, to, only, one, color, of, light, and, not, to, others, since, silver, halide, particles, are, intrinsically, sensitive, only, to, wavelengths, below, 450, nm, which, is, blue, light, the, sensitizing, dyes, are, absorbed, at, dislocations, in, the, silver, halide, particles, in, the, emulsion, on, the, film, the, sensitizing, dyes, may, be, supersensitized, with, a, supersensitizing, dye, that, assists, the, function, of, the, sensitizing, dye, and, improves, the, efficiency, of, photon, capture, by, silver, halide, each, layer, has, a, different, type, of, color, dye, forming, coupler, in, the, blue, sensitive, layer, the, coupler, forms, a, yellow, dye, in, the, green, sensitive, layer, the, coupler, forms, a, magenta, dye, and, in, the, red, sensitive, layer, the, coupler, forms, a, cyan, dye, color, films, often, have, an, uv, blocking, layer, each, emulsion, layer, in, a, color, film, may, itself, have, three, layers, a, slow, medium, and, fast, layer, to, allow, the, film, to, capture, higher, contrast, images, the, color, dye, couplers, are, inside, oil, droplets, dispersed, in, the, emulsion, around, silver, halide, crystals, forming, a, silver, halide, grain, here, the, oil, droplets, act, as, a, surfactant, also, protecting, the, couplers, from, chemical, reactions, with, the, silver, halide, and, from, the, surrounding, gelatin, during, development, oxidized, developer, diffuses, into, the, oil, droplets, and, combines, with, the, dye, couplers, to, form, dye, clouds, the, dye, clouds, only, form, around, unexposed, silver, halide, crystals, the, fixer, then, removes, the, silver, halide, crystals, leaving, only, the, dye, clouds, this, means, that, developed, color, films, may, not, contain, silver, while, undeveloped, films, do, contain, silver, this, also, means, that, the, fixer, can, start, to, contain, silver, which, can, then, be, removed, through, electrolysis, color, films, also, contain, light, filters, to, filter, out, certain, colors, as, the, light, passes, through, the, film, often, there, is, a, blue, light, filter, between, the, blue, and, green, sensitive, layers, and, a, yellow, filter, before, the, red, sensitive, layer, in, this, way, each, layer, is, made, sensitive, to, only, a, certain, color, of, light, the, couplers, need, to, be, made, resistant, to, diffusion, non, diffusible, so, that, they, will, not, move, between, the, layers, of, the, film, and, thus, cause, incorrect, color, rendition, as, the, couplers, are, specific, to, either, cyan, magenta, or, yellow, colors, this, is, done, by, making, couplers, with, a, ballast, group, such, as, a, lipophilic, group, oil, protected, and, applying, them, in, oil, droplets, to, the, film, or, a, hydrophilic, group, or, in, a, polymer, layer, such, as, a, loadable, latex, layer, with, oil, protected, couplers, in, which, case, they, are, considered, to, be, polymer, protected, the, color, couplers, may, be, colorless, and, be, chromogenic, or, be, colored, colored, couplers, are, used, to, improve, the, color, reproduction, of, film, the, first, coupler, which, is, used, in, the, blue, layer, remains, colorless, to, allow, all, light, to, pass, through, but, the, coupler, used, in, the, green, layer, is, colored, yellow, and, the, coupler, used, in, the, red, layer, is, light, pink, yellow, was, chosen, to, block, any, remaining, blue, light, from, exposing, the, underlying, green, and, red, layers, since, yellow, can, be, made, from, green, and, red, each, layer, should, only, be, sensitive, to, a, single, color, of, light, and, allow, all, others, to, pass, through, because, of, these, colored, couplers, the, developed, film, appears, orange, colored, couplers, mean, that, corrections, through, color, filters, need, to, be, applied, to, the, image, before, printing, printing, can, be, carried, out, by, using, an, optical, enlarger, or, by, scanning, the, image, correcting, it, using, software, and, printing, it, using, a, digital, printer, kodachrome, films, have, no, couplers, the, dyes, are, instead, formed, by, a, long, sequence, of, steps, limiting, adoption, among, smaller, film, processing, companies, black, and, white, films, are, very, simple, by, comparison, only, consisting, of, silver, halide, crystals, suspended, in, a, gelatin, emulsion, which, sits, on, a, film, base, with, an, antihalation, back, many, films, contain, a, top, supercoat, layer, to, protect, the, emulsion, layers, from, damage, some, manufacturers, manufacture, their, films, with, daylight, tungsten, named, after, the, tungsten, filament, of, incandescent, and, halogen, lamps, or, fluorescent, lighting, in, mind, recommending, the, use, of, lens, filters, light, meters, and, test, shots, in, some, situations, to, maintain, color, balance, or, by, recommending, the, division, of, the, iso, value, of, the, film, by, the, distance, of, the, subject, from, the, camera, to, get, an, appropriate, f, number, value, to, be, set, in, the, lens, examples, of, color, films, are, kodachrome, often, processed, using, the, k, 14, process, kodacolor, ektachrome, which, is, often, processed, using, the, e, 6, process, and, fujifilm, superia, which, is, processed, using, the, c, 41, process, the, chemicals, and, the, color, dye, couplers, on, the, film, may, vary, depending, on, the, process, used, to, develop, the, film, film, speed, describes, a, film, s, threshold, sensitivity, to, light, the, international, standard, for, rating, film, speed, is, the, iso, scale, which, combines, both, the, asa, speed, and, the, din, speed, in, the, format, asa, din, using, iso, convention, film, with, an, asa, speed, of, 400, would, be, labeled, 400, 27, a, fourth, naming, standard, is, gost, developed, by, the, russian, standards, authority, see, the, film, speed, article, for, a, table, of, conversions, between, asa, din, and, gost, film, speeds, common, film, speeds, include, iso, 25, 50, 64, 100, 160, 200, 400, 800, and, 1600, consumer, print, films, are, usually, in, the, iso, 100, to, iso, 800, range, some, films, like, kodak, s, technical, pan, are, not, iso, rated, and, therefore, careful, examination, of, the, film, s, properties, must, be, made, by, the, photographer, before, exposure, and, development, iso, 25, film, is, very, slow, as, it, requires, much, more, exposure, to, produce, a, usable, image, than, fast, iso, 800, film, films, of, iso, 800, and, greater, are, thus, better, suited, to, low, light, situations, and, action, shots, where, the, short, exposure, time, limits, the, total, light, received, the, benefit, of, slower, film, is, that, it, usually, has, finer, grain, and, better, color, rendition, than, fast, film, professional, photographers, of, static, subjects, such, as, portraits, or, landscapes, usually, seek, these, qualities, and, therefore, require, a, tripod, to, stabilize, the, camera, for, a, longer, exposure, a, professional, photographing, subjects, such, as, rapidly, moving, sports, or, in, low, light, conditions, will, inevitably, choose, a, faster, film, a, film, with, a, particular, iso, rating, can, be, push, processed, or, pushed, to, behave, like, a, film, with, a, higher, iso, by, developing, for, a, longer, amount, of, time, or, at, a, higher, temperature, than, usual, 160, more, rarely, a, film, can, be, pulled, to, behave, like, a, slower, film, pushing, generally, coarsens, grain, and, increases, contrast, reducing, dynamic, range, to, the, detriment, of, overall, quality, nevertheless, it, can, be, a, useful, tradeoff, in, difficult, shooting, environments, if, the, alternative, is, no, usable, shot, at, all, instant, photography, as, popularized, by, polaroid, uses, a, special, type, of, camera, and, film, that, automates, and, integrates, development, without, the, need, of, further, equipment, or, chemicals, this, process, is, carried, out, immediately, after, exposure, as, opposed, to, regular, film, which, is, developed, afterwards, and, requires, additional, chemicals, see, instant, film, films, can, be, made, to, record, non, visible, ultraviolet, uv, and, infrared, ir, radiation, these, films, generally, require, special, equipment, for, example, most, photographic, lenses, are, made, of, glass, and, will, therefore, filter, out, most, ultraviolet, light, instead, expensive, lenses, made, of, quartz, must, be, used, infrared, films, may, be, shot, in, standard, cameras, using, an, infrared, band, or, long, pass, filters, although, the, infrared, focal, point, must, be, compensated, for, exposure, and, focusing, are, difficult, when, using, uv, or, ir, film, with, a, camera, and, lens, designed, for, visible, light, the, iso, standard, for, film, speed, only, applies, to, visible, light, so, visual, spectrum, light, meters, are, nearly, useless, film, manufacturers, can, supply, suggested, equivalent, film, speeds, under, different, conditions, and, recommend, heavy, bracketing, e, g, with, a, certain, filter, assume, iso, 25, under, daylight, and, iso, 64, under, tungsten, lighting, this, allows, a, light, meter, to, be, used, to, estimate, an, exposure, the, focal, point, for, ir, is, slightly, farther, away, from, the, camera, than, visible, light, and, uv, slightly, closer, this, must, be, compensated, for, when, focusing, apochromatic, lenses, are, sometimes, recommended, due, to, their, improved, focusing, across, the, spectrum, film, optimized, for, detecting, x, ray, radiation, is, commonly, used, for, medical, radiography, and, industrial, radiography, by, placing, the, subject, between, the, film, and, a, source, of, x, rays, or, gamma, rays, without, a, lens, as, if, a, translucent, object, were, imaged, by, being, placed, between, a, light, source, and, standard, film, unlike, other, types, of, film, x, ray, film, has, a, sensitive, emulsion, on, both, sides, of, the, carrier, material, this, reduces, the, x, ray, exposure, for, an, acceptable, image, a, desirable, feature, in, medical, radiography, the, film, is, usually, placed, in, close, contact, with, phosphor, screen, s, and, or, thin, lead, foil, screen, s, the, combination, having, a, higher, sensitivity, to, x, rays, because, film, is, sensitive, to, x, rays, its, contents, may, be, wiped, by, airport, baggage, scanners, if, the, film, has, a, speed, higher, than, 800, iso, this, property, is, exploited, in, film, badge, dosimeters, film, optimized, for, detecting, x, rays, and, gamma, rays, is, sometimes, used, for, radiation, dosimetry, film, has, a, number, of, disadvantages, as, a, scientific, detector, it, is, difficult, to, calibrate, for, photometry, it, is, not, re, usable, it, requires, careful, handling, including, temperature, and, humidity, control, for, best, calibration, and, the, film, must, physically, be, returned, to, the, laboratory, and, processed, against, this, photographic, film, can, be, made, with, a, higher, spatial, resolution, than, any, other, type, of, imaging, detector, and, because, of, its, logarithmic, response, to, light, has, a, wider, dynamic, range, than, most, digital, detectors, for, example, agfa, 10e56, holographic, film, has, a, resolution, of, over, 4, 000, lines, mm, equivalent, to, a, pixel, size, of, 0, 125, micrometers, and, an, active, dynamic, range, of, over, five, orders, of, magnitude, in, brightness, compared, to, typical, scientific, ccds, that, might, have, pixels, of, about, 10, micrometers, and, a, dynamic, range, of, 3, 4, orders, of, magnitude, special, films, are, used, for, the, long, exposures, required, by, astrophotography, lith, films, used, in, the, printing, industry, in, particular, when, exposed, via, a, ruled, glass, screen, or, contact, screen, halftone, images, suitable, for, printing, could, be, generated, some, film, cameras, have, the, ability, to, read, metadata, from, the, film, canister, or, encode, metadata, on, film, negatives, negative, imprinting, is, a, feature, of, some, film, cameras, in, which, the, date, shutter, speed, and, aperture, setting, are, recorded, on, the, negative, directly, as, the, film, is, exposed, the, first, known, version, of, this, process, was, patented, in, the, united, states, in, 1975, using, half, silvered, mirrors, to, direct, the, readout, of, a, digital, clock, and, mix, it, with, the, light, rays, coming, through, the, main, camera, lens, modern, slr, cameras, use, an, imprinter, fixed, to, the, back, of, the, camera, on, the, film, backing, plate, it, uses, a, small, led, display, for, illumination, and, optics, to, focus, the, light, onto, a, specific, part, of, the, film, the, led, display, is, exposed, on, the, negative, at, the, same, time, the, picture, is, taken, digital, cameras, can, often, encode, all, the, information, in, the, image, file, itself, the, exif, format, is, the, most, commonly, used, format, in, the, 1980s, kodak, developed, dx, encoding, from, digital, index, or, dx, coding, a, feature, that, was, eventually, adapted, by, all, camera, and, film, manufacturers, dx, encoding, provides, information, on, both, the, film, cassette, and, on, the, film, regarding, the, type, of, film, number, of, exposures, speed, iso, asa, rating, of, the, film, it, consists, of, three, types, of, identification, first, is, a, barcode, near, the, film, opening, of, the, cassette, identifying, the, manufacturer, film, type, and, processing, method, see, image, below, left, this, is, used, by, photofinishing, equipment, during, film, processing, the, second, part, is, a, barcode, on, the, edge, of, the, film, see, image, below, right, used, also, during, processing, which, indicates, the, image, film, type, manufacturer, frame, number, and, synchronizes, the, position, of, the, frame, the, third, part, of, dx, coding, known, as, the, dx, camera, auto, sensing, cas, code, consists, of, a, series, of, 12, metal, contacts, on, the, film, cassette, which, beginning, with, cameras, manufactured, after, 1985, could, detect, the, type, of, film, number, of, exposures, and, iso, of, the, film, and, use, that, information, to, automatically, adjust, the, camera, settings, for, the, speed, of, the, film, source, e, g, kodak, advantix, different, aspect, ratios, possible, data, recorded, on, magnetic, strip, processed, film, remains, in, cartridge, the, earliest, practical, photographic, process, was, the, daguerreotype, it, was, introduced, in, 1839, and, did, not, use, film, the, light, sensitive, chemicals, were, formed, on, the, surface, of, a, silver, plated, copper, sheet, the, calotype, process, produced, paper, negatives, beginning, in, the, 1850s, thin, glass, plates, coated, with, photographic, emulsion, became, the, standard, material, for, use, in, the, camera, although, fragile, and, relatively, heavy, the, glass, used, for, photographic, plates, was, of, better, optical, quality, than, early, transparent, plastics, and, was, at, first, less, expensive, glass, plates, continued, to, be, used, long, after, the, introduction, of, film, and, were, used, for, astrophotography, and, electron, micrography, until, the, early, 2000s, when, they, were, supplanted, by, digital, recording, methods, ilford, continues, to, manufacture, glass, plates, for, special, scientific, applications, the, first, flexible, photographic, roll, film, was, sold, by, george, eastman, in, 1885, but, this, original, film, was, actually, a, coating, on, a, paper, base, as, part, of, the, processing, the, image, bearing, layer, was, stripped, from, the, paper, and, attached, to, a, sheet, of, hardened, clear, gelatin, the, first, transparent, plastic, roll, film, followed, in, 1889, it, was, made, from, highly, flammable, cellulose, nitrate, film, although, cellulose, acetate, or, safety, film, had, been, introduced, by, kodak, in, 1908, at, first, it, found, only, a, few, special, applications, as, an, alternative, to, the, hazardous, nitrate, film, which, had, the, advantages, of, being, considerably, tougher, slightly, more, transparent, and, cheaper, the, changeover, was, completed, for, x, ray, films, in, 1933, but, although, safety, film, was, always, used, for, 16, mm, and, 8, mm, home, movies, nitrate, film, remained, standard, for, theatrical, 35, mm, films, until, it, was, finally, discontinued, in, 1951, hurter, and, driffield, began, pioneering, work, on, the, light, sensitivity, of, photographic, emulsions, in, 1876, their, work, enabled, the, first, quantitative, measure, of, film, speed, to, be, devised, they, developed, h, d, curves, which, are, specific, for, each, film, and, paper, these, curves, plot, the, photographic, density, against, the, log, of, the, exposure, to, determine, sensitivity, or, speed, of, the, emulsion, and, enabling, correct, exposure, early, photographic, plates, and, films, were, usefully, sensitive, only, to, blue, violet, and, ultraviolet, light, as, a, result, the, relative, tonal, values, in, a, scene, registered, roughly, as, they, would, appear, if, viewed, through, a, piece, of, deep, blue, glass, blue, skies, with, interesting, cloud, formations, photographed, as, a, white, blank, any, detail, visible, in, masses, of, green, foliage, was, due, mainly, to, the, colorless, surface, gloss, bright, yellows, and, reds, appeared, nearly, black, most, skin, tones, came, out, unnaturally, dark, and, uneven, or, freckled, complexions, were, exaggerated, photographers, sometimes, compensated, by, adding, in, skies, from, separate, negatives, that, had, been, exposed, and, processed, to, optimize, the, visibility, of, the, clouds, by, manually, retouching, their, negatives, to, adjust, problematic, tonal, values, and, by, heavily, powdering, the, faces, of, their, portrait, sitters, in, 1873, hermann, wilhelm, vogel, discovered, that, the, spectral, sensitivity, could, be, extended, to, green, and, yellow, light, by, adding, very, small, quantities, of, certain, dyes, to, the, emulsion, the, instability, of, early, sensitizing, dyes, and, their, tendency, to, rapidly, cause, fogging, initially, confined, their, use, to, the, laboratory, but, in, 1883, the, first, commercially, dye, sensitized, plates, appeared, on, the, market, these, early, products, described, as, isochromatic, or, orthochromatic, depending, on, the, manufacturer, made, possible, a, more, accurate, rendering, of, colored, subject, matter, into, a, black, and, white, image, because, they, were, still, disproportionately, sensitive, to, blue, the, use, of, a, yellow, filter, and, a, consequently, longer, exposure, time, were, required, to, take, full, advantage, of, their, extended, sensitivity, in, 1894, the, lumi, re, brothers, introduced, their, lumi, re, panchromatic, plate, which, was, made, sensitive, although, very, unequally, to, all, colors, including, red, new, and, improved, sensitizing, dyes, were, developed, and, in, 1902, the, much, more, evenly, color, sensitive, perchromo, panchromatic, plate, was, being, sold, by, the, german, manufacturer, perutz, the, commercial, availability, of, highly, panchromatic, black, and, white, emulsions, also, accelerated, the, progress, of, practical, color, photography, which, requires, good, sensitivity, to, all, the, colors, of, the, spectrum, for, the, red, green, and, blue, channels, of, color, information, to, all, be, captured, with, reasonable, exposure, times, however, all, of, these, were, glass, based, plate, products, panchromatic, emulsions, on, a, film, base, were, not, commercially, available, until, the, 1910s, and, did, not, come, into, general, use, until, much, later, many, photographers, who, did, their, own, darkroom, work, preferred, to, go, without, the, seeming, luxury, of, sensitivity, to, red, a, rare, color, in, nature, and, uncommon, even, in, human, made, objects, rather, than, be, forced, to, abandon, the, traditional, red, darkroom, safelight, and, process, their, exposed, film, in, complete, darkness, kodak, s, popular, verichrome, black, and, white, snapshot, film, introduced, in, 1931, remained, a, red, insensitive, orthochromatic, product, until, 1956, when, it, was, replaced, by, verichrome, pan, amateur, darkroom, enthusiasts, then, had, to, handle, the, undeveloped, film, by, the, sense, of, touch, alone, experiments, with, color, photography, began, almost, as, early, as, photography, itself, but, the, three, color, principle, underlying, all, practical, processes, was, not, set, forth, until, 1855, not, demonstrated, until, 1861, and, not, generally, accepted, as, real, color, photography, until, it, had, become, an, undeniable, commercial, reality, in, the, early, 20th, century, although, color, photographs, of, good, quality, were, being, made, by, the, 1890s, they, required, special, equipment, separate, and, long, exposures, through, three, color, filters, complex, printing, or, display, procedures, and, highly, specialized, skills, so, they, were, then, exceedingly, rare, the, first, practical, and, commercially, successful, color, film, was, the, lumi, re, autochrome, a, glass, plate, product, introduced, in, 1907, it, was, expensive, and, not, sensitive, enough, for, hand, held, snapshot, use, film, based, versions, were, introduced, in, the, early, 1930s, and, the, sensitivity, was, later, improved, these, were, mosaic, screen, additive, color, products, which, used, a, simple, layer, of, black, and, white, emulsion, in, combination, with, a, layer, of, microscopically, small, color, filter, elements, the, resulting, transparencies, or, slides, were, very, dark, because, the, color, filter, mosaic, layer, absorbed, most, of, the, light, passing, through, the, last, films, of, this, type, were, discontinued, in, the, 1950s, but, polachrome, instant, slide, film, introduced, in, 1983, temporarily, revived, the, technology, color, film, in, the, modern, sense, of, a, subtractive, color, product, with, a, multi, layered, emulsion, was, born, with, the, introduction, of, kodachrome, for, home, movies, in, 1935, and, as, lengths, of, 35, mm, film, for, still, cameras, in, 1936, however, it, required, a, complex, development, process, with, multiple, dyeing, steps, as, each, color, layer, was, processed, separately, 1936, also, saw, the, launch, of, agfa, color, neu, the, first, subtractive, three, color, reversal, film, for, movie, and, still, camera, use, to, incorporate, color, dye, couplers, which, could, be, processed, at, the, same, time, by, a, single, color, developer, the, film, had, some, 278, patents, the, incorporation, of, color, couplers, formed, the, basis, of, subsequent, color, film, design, with, the, agfa, process, initially, adopted, by, ferrania, fuji, and, konica, and, lasting, until, the, late, 70s, early, 1980s, in, the, west, and, 1990s, in, eastern, europe, the, process, used, dye, forming, chemicals, that, terminated, with, sulfonic, acid, groups, and, had, to, be, coated, one, layer, at, a, time, it, was, a, further, innovation, by, kodak, using, dye, forming, chemicals, which, terminated, in, fatty, tails, which, permitted, multiple, layers, to, coated, at, the, same, time, in, a, single, pass, reducing, production, time, and, cost, that, later, became, universally, adopted, along, with, the, kodak, c, 41, process, despite, greater, availability, of, color, film, after, wwii, during, the, next, several, decades, it, remained, much, more, expensive, than, black, and, white, and, required, much, more, light, factors, which, combined, with, the, greater, cost, of, processing, and, printing, delayed, its, widespread, adoption, decreasing, cost, increasing, sensitivity, and, standardized, processing, gradually, overcame, these, impediments, by, the, 1970s, color, film, predominated, in, the, consumer, market, while, the, use, of, black, and, white, film, was, increasingly, confined, to, photojournalism, and, fine, art, photography, photographic, lenses, and, equipment, are, designed, around, the, film, to, be, used, although, the, earliest, photographic, materials, were, sensitive, only, to, the, blue, violet, end, of, the, spectrum, partially, color, corrected, achromatic, lenses, were, normally, used, so, that, when, the, photographer, brought, the, visually, brightest, yellow, rays, to, a, sharp, focus, the, visually, dimmest, but, photographically, most, active, violet, rays, would, be, correctly, focused, too, the, introduction, of, orthochromatic, emulsions, required, the, whole, range, of, colors, from, yellow, to, blue, to, be, brought, to, an, adequate, focus, most, plates, and, films, described, as, orthochromatic, or, isochromatic, were, practically, insensitive, to, red, so, the, correct, focus, of, red, light, was, unimportant, a, red, window, could, be, used, to, view, the, frame, numbers, on, the, paper, backing, of, roll, film, as, any, red, light, which, leaked, around, the, backing, would, not, fog, the, film, and, red, lighting, could, be, used, in, darkrooms, with, the, introduction, of, panchromatic, film, the, whole, visible, spectrum, needed, to, be, brought, to, an, acceptably, sharp, focus, in, all, cases, a, color, cast, in, the, lens, glass, or, faint, colored, reflections, in, the, image, were, of, no, consequence, as, they, would, merely, change, the, contrast, a, little, this, was, no, longer, acceptable, when, using, color, film, more, highly, corrected, lenses, for, newer, emulsions, could, be, used, with, older, emulsion, types, but, the, converse, was, not, true, the, progression, of, lens, design, for, later, emulsions, is, of, practical, importance, when, considering, the, use, of, old, lenses, still, often, used, on, large, format, equipment, a, lens, designed, for, orthochromatic, film, may, have, visible, defects, with, a, color, emulsion, a, lens, for, panchromatic, film, will, be, better, but, not, as, good, as, later, designs, the, filters, used, were, different, for, the, different, film, types, film, remained, the, dominant, form, of, photography, until, the, early, 21st, century, when, advances, in, digital, photography, drew, consumers, to, digital, formats, the, first, consumer, electronic, camera, the, sony, mavica, was, released, in, 1981, the, first, digital, camera, the, fuji, ds, x, released, in, 1989, coupled, with, advances, in, software, such, as, adobe, photoshop, which, was, released, in, 1989, improvements, in, consumer, level, digital, color, printers, and, increasingly, widespread, computers, in, households, during, the, late, 20th, century, facilitated, uptake, of, digital, photography, by, consumers, the, initial, take, up, of, digital, cameras, in, the, 1990s, was, slow, due, to, their, high, cost, and, relatively, low, resolution, of, the, images, compared, to, 35mm, film, but, began, to, make, inroads, among, consumers, in, the, point, and, shoot, market, and, in, professional, applications, such, as, sports, photography, where, speed, of, results, including, the, ability, to, upload, pictures, direct, from, stadia, was, more, critical, for, newspaper, deadlines, than, resolution, a, key, difference, compared, to, film, was, that, early, digital, cameras, were, soon, obsolete, forcing, users, into, a, frequent, cycle, of, replacement, until, the, technology, began, to, mature, whereas, previously, people, might, have, only, owned, one, or, two, film, cameras, in, their, lifetime, consequently, photographers, demanding, higher, quality, in, sectors, such, as, weddings, portraiture, and, fashion, where, medium, format, film, predominated, were, the, last, to, switch, once, resolution, began, to, reach, acceptable, levels, with, the, advent, of, full, frame, sensors, digital, backs, and, medium, format, digital, cameras, film, camera, sales, based, on, cipa, figures, peaked, in, 1998, before, declining, rapidly, after, 2000, to, reach, almost, zero, by, the, end, of, 2005, as, consumers, switched, en, masse, to, digital, cameras, sales, of, which, subsequently, peaked, in, 2010, these, changes, foretold, a, similar, reduction, in, film, sales, figures, for, fujifilm, show, global, film, sales, having, grown, 30, in, the, preceding, five, years, peaked, around, the, year, 2000, film, sales, then, began, a, period, of, year, on, year, falling, sales, of, increasing, magnitude, from, 2003, to, 2008, reaching, 30, per, annum, before, slowing, by, 2011, sales, were, less, than, 10, of, the, peak, volumes, similar, patterns, were, experienced, by, other, manufacturers, varying, by, market, exposure, with, global, film, sales, estimated, at, 200, million, rolls, in, 1999, declining, to, only, 5, million, rolls, by, 2009, this, period, wreaked, havoc, on, the, film, manufacturing, industry, and, its, supply, chain, optimised, for, high, production, volumes, plummeting, sales, saw, firms, fighting, for, survival, agfa, gevaert, s, decision, to, sell, off, its, consumer, facing, arm, agfaphoto, in, 2004, was, followed, by, a, series, of, bankruptcies, of, established, film, manufacturers, ilford, imaging, uk, in, 2004, agfaphoto, in, 2005, forte, in, 2007, foton, in, 2007, polaroid, in, 2001, and, 2008, ferrania, in, 2009, and, eastman, kodak, in, 2012, the, latter, only, surviving, after, massive, downsizing, whilst, ilford, was, rescued, by, a, management, buyout, konica, minolta, closed, its, film, manufacturing, business, and, exited, the, photographic, market, entirely, in, 2006, selling, its, camera, patents, to, sony, and, fujifilm, successfully, moved, to, rapidly, diversify, into, other, markets, the, impact, of, this, paradigm, shift, in, technology, subsequently, rippled, though, the, downstream, photo, processing, and, finishing, businesses, although, modern, photography, is, dominated, by, digital, users, film, continues, to, be, used, by, enthusiasts, film, remains, the, preference, of, some, photographers, because, of, its, distinctive, look, despite, the, fact, that, digital, cameras, are, by, far, the, most, commonly, used, photographic, tool, and, that, the, selection, of, available, photographic, films, is, much, smaller, than, it, once, was, sales, of, photographic, film, have, been, on, a, steady, upward, trend, kodak, which, was, under, bankruptcy, protection, from, january, 2012, to, september, 2013, and, other, companies, have, noticed, this, upward, trend, dennis, olbrich, president, of, the, imaging, paper, photo, chemicals, and, film, division, at, kodak, alaris, has, stated, that, sales, of, their, photographic, films, have, been, growing, over, the, past, three, or, four, years, uk, based, ilford, have, confirmed, this, trend, and, conducted, extensive, research, on, this, subject, matter, their, research, showing, that, 60, of, current, film, users, had, only, started, using, film, in, the, past, five, years, and, that, 30, of, current, film, users, were, under, 35, years, old, annual, film, sales, which, were, estimated, to, reach, a, low, of, 5, million, rolls, in, 2009, have, since, doubled, to, around, 10, million, rolls, in, 2019, a, key, challenge, for, the, industry, is, that, production, relies, on, the, remaining, coating, facilities, that, were, built, for, the, peak, years, of, demand, but, as, demand, has, grown, capacity, constraints, in, some, of, the, other, process, steps, which, have, been, downscaled, such, as, converting, film, have, caused, production, bottlenecks, for, companies, such, as, kodak, in, 2013, ferrania, an, italy, based, film, manufacturer, which, ceased, production, of, photographic, films, between, the, years, 2009, and, 2010, was, acquired, by, the, new, film, ferrania, s, r, l, taking, over, a, small, part, of, the, old, company, s, manufacturing, facilities, using, its, former, research, facility, and, re, employed, some, workers, who, had, been, laid, off, three, years, earlier, when, the, company, stopped, production, of, film, in, november, of, the, same, year, the, company, started, a, crowdfunding, campaign, with, the, goal, of, raising, 250, 000, to, buy, tooling, and, machines, from, the, old, factory, with, the, intention, of, putting, some, of, the, films, that, had, been, discontinued, back, into, production, the, campaign, succeeded, and, in, october, 2014, was, ended, with, over, 320, 000, being, raised, in, february, 2017, film, ferrania, unveiled, their, p30, 80, asa, panchromatic, black, and, white, film, in, 35mm, format, kodak, announced, on, january, 5, 2017, that, ektachrome, one, of, kodak, s, most, well, known, transparency, films, that, had, been, discontinued, between, 2012, and, 2013, would, be, reformulated, and, manufactured, once, again, in, 35, mm, still, and, super, 8, motion, picture, film, formats, following, the, success, of, the, release, kodak, expanded, ektachrome, s, format, availability, by, also, releasing, the, film, in, 120, and, 4x5, formats, japan, based, fujifilm, s, instant, film, instax, cameras, and, paper, have, also, proven, to, be, very, successful, and, have, replaced, traditional, photographic, films, as, fujifilm, s, main, film, products, while, they, continue, to, offer, traditional, photographic, films, in, various, formats, and, types, in, 2023, a, finnish, chemist, sami, vuori, invented, a, reusable, film, that, uses, synthetic, hackmanite, na, 8, al, 6, si, 6, o, 24, cl, s, 2, as, the, photosensitive, medium, the, film, contains, small, hackmanite, particles, that, color, purple, with, exposure, to, ultraviolet, radiation, e, g, 254, nm, after, which, the, film, is, loaded, into, the, camera, visible, light, bleaches, the, hackmanite, particles, back, to, white, which, gives, rise, to, the, formation, of, a, positive, image, the, film, can, then, be, scanned, with, a, typical, document, scanner, and, then, colored, again, with, uv, if, the, user, wants, to, spare, the, image, the, film, can, be, put, into, a, dark, place, as, the, bleaching, process, stops, completely, in, the, absence, of, light, on, top, of, reusability, and, not, needing, any, developing, or, chemicals, another, advantage, with, this, type, of, photochromic, film, is, that, it, does, not, need, gelatin, which, renders, it, a, vegan, alternative, however, the, main, disadvantage, is, still, the, film, s, very, slow, exposure, requiring, hours, of, exposure, time, this, means, that, currently, this, type, of, film, can, be, used, only, in, ultra, long, exposure, film, photography, where, the, subject, is, e, g, a, city, center, where, the, photographer, wants, to, fade, all, movement, another, reusable, film, invented, by, liou, et, al, is, based, on, 9, methylacridinium, intercalated, clay, particles, but, erasing, the, image, requires, dipping, the, material, in, sulfuric, acid
