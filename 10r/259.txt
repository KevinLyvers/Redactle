forging, is, a, manufacturing, process, involving, the, shaping, of, metal, using, localized, compressive, forces, the, blows, are, delivered, with, a, hammer, often, a, power, hammer, or, a, die, forging, is, often, classified, according, to, the, temperature, at, which, it, is, performed, cold, forging, a, type, of, cold, working, warm, forging, or, hot, forging, a, type, of, hot, working, for, the, latter, two, the, metal, is, heated, usually, in, a, forge, forged, parts, can, range, in, weight, from, less, than, a, kilogram, to, hundreds, of, metric, tons, forging, has, been, done, by, smiths, for, millennia, the, traditional, products, were, kitchenware, hardware, hand, tools, edged, weapons, cymbals, and, jewellery, since, the, industrial, revolution, forged, parts, are, widely, used, in, mechanisms, and, machines, wherever, a, component, requires, high, strength, such, forgings, usually, require, further, processing, such, as, machining, to, achieve, a, finished, part, today, forging, is, a, major, worldwide, industry, forging, is, one, of, the, oldest, known, metalworking, processes, traditionally, forging, was, performed, by, a, smith, using, hammer, and, anvil, though, introducing, water, power, to, the, production, and, working, of, iron, in, the, 12th, century, allowed, the, use, of, large, trip, hammers, or, power, hammers, that, increased, the, amount, and, size, of, iron, that, could, be, produced, and, forged, the, smithy, or, forge, has, evolved, over, centuries, to, become, a, facility, with, engineered, processes, production, equipment, tooling, raw, materials, and, products, to, meet, the, demands, of, modern, industry, in, modern, times, industrial, forging, is, done, either, with, presses, or, with, hammers, powered, by, compressed, air, electricity, hydraulics, or, steam, these, hammers, may, have, reciprocating, weights, in, the, thousands, of, pounds, smaller, power, hammers, 500, lb, 230, kg, or, less, reciprocating, weight, and, hydraulic, presses, are, common, in, art, smithies, as, well, some, steam, hammers, remain, in, use, but, they, became, obsolete, with, the, availability, of, the, other, more, convenient, power, sources, there, are, many, different, kinds, of, forging, processes, available, however, they, can, be, grouped, into, three, main, classes, common, forging, processes, include, roll, forging, swaging, cogging, open, die, forging, impression, die, forging, closed, die, forging, press, forging, cold, forging, automatic, hot, forging, and, upsetting, all, of, the, following, forging, processes, can, be, performed, at, various, temperatures, however, they, are, generally, classified, by, whether, the, metal, temperature, is, above, or, below, the, recrystallization, temperature, if, the, temperature, is, above, the, material, s, recrystallization, temperature, it, is, deemed, hot, forging, if, the, temperature, is, below, the, material, s, recrystallization, temperature, but, above, 30, of, the, recrystallization, temperature, on, an, absolute, scale, it, is, deemed, warm, forging, if, below, 30, of, the, recrystallization, temperature, usually, room, temperature, then, it, is, deemed, cold, forging, the, main, advantage, of, hot, forging, is, that, it, can, be, done, more, quickly, and, precisely, and, as, the, metal, is, deformed, work, hardening, effects, are, negated, by, the, recrystallization, process, cold, forging, typically, results, in, work, hardening, of, the, piece, drop, forging, is, a, forging, process, where, a, hammer, is, raised, and, then, dropped, into, the, workpiece, to, deform, it, according, to, the, shape, of, the, die, there, are, two, types, of, drop, forging, open, die, drop, forging, and, impression, die, or, closed, die, drop, forging, as, the, names, imply, the, difference, is, in, the, shape, of, the, die, with, the, former, not, fully, enclosing, the, workpiece, while, the, latter, does, open, die, forging, is, also, known, as, smith, forging, in, open, die, forging, a, hammer, strikes, and, deforms, the, workpiece, which, is, placed, on, a, stationary, anvil, open, die, forging, gets, its, name, from, the, fact, that, the, dies, the, surfaces, that, are, in, contact, with, the, workpiece, do, not, enclose, the, workpiece, allowing, it, to, flow, except, where, contacted, by, the, dies, the, operator, therefore, needs, to, orient, and, position, the, workpiece, to, get, the, desired, shape, the, dies, are, usually, flat, in, shape, but, some, have, a, specially, shaped, surface, for, specialized, operations, for, example, a, die, may, have, a, round, concave, or, convex, surface, or, be, a, tool, to, form, holes, or, be, a, cut, off, tool, open, die, forgings, can, be, worked, into, shapes, which, include, discs, hubs, blocks, shafts, including, step, shafts, or, with, flanges, sleeves, cylinders, flats, hexes, rounds, plate, and, some, custom, shapes, open, die, forging, lends, itself, to, short, runs, and, is, appropriate, for, art, smithing, and, custom, work, in, some, cases, open, die, forging, may, be, employed, to, rough, shape, ingots, to, prepare, them, for, subsequent, operations, open, die, forging, may, also, orient, the, grain, to, increase, strength, in, the, required, direction, cogging, is, the, successive, deformation, of, a, bar, along, its, length, using, an, open, die, drop, forge, it, is, commonly, used, to, work, a, piece, of, raw, material, to, the, proper, thickness, once, the, proper, thickness, is, achieved, the, proper, width, is, achieved, via, edging, edging, is, the, process, of, concentrating, material, using, a, concave, shaped, open, die, the, process, is, called, edging, because, it, is, usually, carried, out, on, the, ends, of, the, workpiece, fullering, is, a, similar, process, that, thins, out, sections, of, the, forging, using, a, convex, shaped, die, these, processes, prepare, the, workpieces, for, further, forging, processes, impression, die, forging, is, also, called, closed, die, forging, in, impression, die, forging, the, metal, is, placed, in, a, die, resembling, a, mold, which, is, attached, to, an, anvil, usually, the, hammer, die, is, shaped, as, well, the, hammer, is, then, dropped, on, the, workpiece, causing, the, metal, to, flow, and, fill, the, die, cavities, the, hammer, is, generally, in, contact, with, the, workpiece, on, the, scale, of, milliseconds, depending, on, the, size, and, complexity, of, the, part, the, hammer, may, be, dropped, multiple, times, in, quick, succession, excess, metal, is, squeezed, out, of, the, die, cavities, forming, what, is, referred, to, as, flash, the, flash, cools, more, rapidly, than, the, rest, of, the, material, this, cool, metal, is, stronger, than, the, metal, in, the, die, so, it, helps, prevent, more, flash, from, forming, this, also, forces, the, metal, to, completely, fill, the, die, cavity, after, forging, the, flash, is, removed, in, commercial, impression, die, forging, the, workpiece, is, usually, moved, through, a, series, of, cavities, in, a, die, to, get, from, an, ingot, to, the, final, form, the, first, impression, is, used, to, distribute, the, metal, into, the, rough, shape, in, accordance, to, the, needs, of, later, cavities, this, impression, is, called, an, edging, fullering, or, bending, impression, the, following, cavities, are, called, blocking, cavities, in, which, the, piece, is, working, into, a, shape, that, more, closely, resembles, the, final, product, these, stages, usually, impart, the, workpiece, with, generous, bends, and, large, fillets, the, final, shape, is, forged, in, a, final, or, finisher, impression, cavity, if, there, is, only, a, short, run, of, parts, to, be, done, then, it, may, be, more, economical, for, the, die, to, lack, a, final, impression, cavity, and, instead, machine, the, final, features, impression, die, forging, has, been, improved, in, recent, years, through, increased, automation, which, includes, induction, heating, mechanical, feeding, positioning, and, manipulation, and, the, direct, heat, treatment, of, parts, after, forging, one, variation, of, impression, die, forging, is, called, flashless, forging, or, true, closed, die, forging, in, this, type, of, forging, the, die, cavities, are, completely, closed, which, keeps, the, workpiece, from, forming, flash, the, major, advantage, to, this, process, is, that, less, metal, is, lost, to, flash, flash, can, account, for, 20, to, 45, of, the, starting, material, the, disadvantages, of, this, process, include, additional, cost, due, to, a, more, complex, die, design, and, the, need, for, better, lubrication, and, workpiece, placement, there, are, other, variations, of, part, formation, that, integrate, impression, die, forging, one, method, incorporates, casting, a, forging, preform, from, liquid, metal, the, casting, is, removed, after, it, has, solidified, but, while, still, hot, it, is, then, finished, in, a, single, cavity, die, the, flash, is, trimmed, then, the, part, is, quench, hardened, another, variation, follows, the, same, process, as, outlined, above, except, the, preform, is, produced, by, the, spraying, deposition, of, metal, droplets, into, shaped, collectors, similar, to, the, osprey, process, closed, die, forging, has, a, high, initial, cost, due, to, the, creation, of, dies, and, required, design, work, to, make, working, die, cavities, however, it, has, low, recurring, costs, for, each, part, thus, forgings, become, more, economical, with, greater, production, volume, this, is, one, of, the, major, reasons, closed, die, forgings, are, often, used, in, the, automotive, and, tool, industries, another, reason, forgings, are, common, in, these, industrial, sectors, is, that, forgings, generally, have, about, a, 20, percent, higher, strength, to, weight, ratio, compared, to, cast, or, machined, parts, of, the, same, material, forging, dies, are, usually, made, of, high, alloy, or, tool, steel, dies, must, be, impact, and, wear, resistant, maintain, strength, at, high, temperatures, and, have, the, ability, to, withstand, cycles, of, rapid, heating, and, cooling, in, order, to, produce, a, better, more, economical, die, the, following, standards, are, maintained, barrelling, occurs, when, due, to, friction, between, the, work, piece, and, the, die, or, punch, the, work, piece, bulges, at, its, centre, in, such, a, way, as, to, resemble, a, barrel, this, leads, to, the, central, part, of, the, work, piece, to, come, in, contact, with, the, sides, of, the, die, sooner, than, if, there, were, no, friction, present, creating, a, much, greater, increase, in, the, pressure, required, for, the, punch, to, finish, the, forging, the, dimensional, tolerances, of, a, steel, part, produced, using, the, impression, die, forging, method, are, outlined, in, the, table, below, the, dimensions, across, the, parting, plane, are, affected, by, the, closure, of, the, dies, and, are, therefore, dependent, on, die, wear, and, the, thickness, of, the, final, flash, dimensions, that, are, completely, contained, within, a, single, die, segment, or, half, can, be, maintained, at, a, significantly, greater, level, of, accuracy, a, lubricant, is, used, when, forging, to, reduce, friction, and, wear, it, is, also, used, as, a, thermal, barrier, to, restrict, heat, transfer, from, the, workpiece, to, the, die, finally, the, lubricant, acts, as, a, parting, compound, to, prevent, the, part, from, sticking, in, the, dies, press, forging, works, by, slowly, applying, a, continuous, pressure, or, force, which, differs, from, the, near, instantaneous, impact, of, drop, hammer, forging, the, amount, of, time, the, dies, are, in, contact, with, the, workpiece, is, measured, in, seconds, as, compared, to, the, milliseconds, of, drop, hammer, forges, the, press, forging, operation, can, be, done, either, cold, or, hot, the, main, advantage, of, press, forging, as, compared, to, drop, hammer, forging, is, its, ability, to, deform, the, complete, workpiece, drop, hammer, forging, usually, only, deforms, the, surfaces, of, the, work, piece, in, contact, with, the, hammer, and, anvil, the, interior, of, the, workpiece, will, stay, relatively, undeformed, another, advantage, to, the, process, includes, the, knowledge, of, the, new, part, s, strain, rate, by, controlling, the, compression, rate, of, the, press, forging, operation, the, internal, strain, can, be, controlled, there, are, a, few, disadvantages, to, this, process, most, stemming, from, the, workpiece, being, in, contact, with, the, dies, for, such, an, extended, period, of, time, the, operation, is, a, time, consuming, process, due, to, the, amount, and, length, of, steps, the, workpiece, will, cool, faster, because, the, dies, are, in, contact, with, workpiece, the, dies, facilitate, drastically, more, heat, transfer, than, the, surrounding, atmosphere, as, the, workpiece, cools, it, becomes, stronger, and, less, ductile, which, may, induce, cracking, if, deformation, continues, therefore, heated, dies, are, usually, used, to, reduce, heat, loss, promote, surface, flow, and, enable, the, production, of, finer, details, and, closer, tolerances, the, workpiece, may, also, need, to, be, reheated, when, done, in, high, productivity, press, forging, is, more, economical, than, hammer, forging, the, operation, also, creates, closer, tolerances, in, hammer, forging, a, lot, of, the, work, is, absorbed, by, the, machinery, when, in, press, forging, the, greater, percentage, of, work, is, used, in, the, work, piece, another, advantage, is, that, the, operation, can, be, used, to, create, any, size, part, because, there, is, no, limit, to, the, size, of, the, press, forging, machine, new, press, forging, techniques, have, been, able, to, create, a, higher, degree, of, mechanical, and, orientation, integrity, by, the, constraint, of, oxidation, to, the, outer, layers, of, the, part, reduced, levels, of, microcracking, occur, in, the, finished, part, press, forging, can, be, used, to, perform, all, types, of, forging, including, open, die, and, impression, die, forging, impression, die, press, forging, usually, requires, less, draft, than, drop, forging, and, has, better, dimensional, accuracy, also, press, forgings, can, often, be, done, in, one, closing, of, the, dies, allowing, for, easy, automation, upset, forging, increases, the, diameter, of, the, workpiece, by, compressing, its, length, based, on, number, of, pieces, produced, this, is, the, most, widely, used, forging, process, a, few, examples, of, common, parts, produced, using, the, upset, forging, process, are, engine, valves, couplings, bolts, screws, and, other, fasteners, upset, forging, is, usually, done, in, special, high, speed, machines, called, crank, presses, the, machines, are, usually, set, up, to, work, in, the, horizontal, plane, to, facilitate, the, quick, exchange, of, workpieces, from, one, station, to, the, next, but, upsetting, can, also, be, done, in, a, vertical, crank, press, or, a, hydraulic, press, the, initial, workpiece, is, usually, wire, or, rod, but, some, machines, can, accept, bars, up, to, 25, cm, 9, 8, in, in, diameter, and, a, capacity, of, over, 1000, tons, the, standard, upsetting, machine, employs, split, dies, that, contain, multiple, cavities, the, dies, open, enough, to, allow, the, workpiece, to, move, from, one, cavity, to, the, next, the, dies, then, close, and, the, heading, tool, or, ram, then, moves, longitudinally, against, the, bar, upsetting, it, into, the, cavity, if, all, of, the, cavities, are, utilized, on, every, cycle, then, a, finished, part, will, be, produced, with, every, cycle, which, makes, this, process, advantageous, for, mass, production, these, rules, must, be, followed, when, designing, parts, to, be, upset, forged, the, automatic, hot, forging, process, involves, feeding, mill, length, steel, bars, typically, 7, m, 23, ft, long, into, one, end, of, the, machine, at, room, temperature, and, hot, forged, products, emerge, from, the, other, end, this, all, occurs, rapidly, small, parts, can, be, made, at, a, rate, of, 180, parts, per, minute, ppm, and, larger, can, be, made, at, a, rate, of, 90, ppm, the, parts, can, be, solid, or, hollow, round, or, symmetrical, up, to, 6, kg, 13, lb, and, up, to, 18, cm, 7, 1, in, in, diameter, the, main, advantages, to, this, process, are, its, high, output, rate, and, ability, to, accept, low, cost, materials, little, labor, is, required, to, operate, the, machinery, there, is, no, flash, produced, so, material, savings, are, between, 20, and, 30, over, conventional, forging, the, final, product, is, a, consistent, 1, 050, c, 1, 920, f, so, air, cooling, will, result, in, a, part, that, is, still, easily, machinable, the, advantage, being, the, lack, of, annealing, required, after, forging, tolerances, are, usually, 0, 3, mm, 0, 012, in, surfaces, are, clean, and, draft, angles, are, 0, 5, to, 1, tool, life, is, nearly, double, that, of, conventional, forging, because, contact, times, are, on, the, order, of, 0, 06, second, the, downside, is, that, this, process, is, only, feasible, on, smaller, symmetric, parts, and, cost, the, initial, investment, can, be, over, 10, million, so, large, quantities, are, required, to, justify, this, process, the, process, starts, by, heating, the, bar, to, 1, 200, to, 1, 300, c, 2, 190, to, 2, 370, f, in, less, than, 60, seconds, using, high, power, induction, coils, it, is, then, descaled, with, rollers, sheared, into, blanks, and, transferred, through, several, successive, forming, stages, during, which, it, is, upset, preformed, final, forged, and, pierced, if, necessary, this, process, can, also, be, coupled, with, high, speed, cold, forming, operations, generally, the, cold, forming, operation, will, do, the, finishing, stage, so, that, the, advantages, of, cold, working, can, be, obtained, while, maintaining, the, high, speed, of, automatic, hot, forging, examples, of, parts, made, by, this, process, are, wheel, hub, unit, bearings, transmission, gears, tapered, roller, bearing, races, stainless, steel, coupling, flanges, and, neck, rings, for, liquid, propane, lp, gas, cylinders, manual, transmission, gears, are, an, example, of, automatic, hot, forging, used, in, conjunction, with, cold, working, roll, forging, is, a, process, where, round, or, flat, bar, stock, is, reduced, in, thickness, and, increased, in, length, roll, forging, is, performed, using, two, cylindrical, or, semi, cylindrical, rolls, each, containing, one, or, more, shaped, grooves, a, heated, bar, is, inserted, into, the, rolls, and, when, it, hits, a, spot, the, rolls, rotate, and, the, bar, is, progressively, shaped, as, it, is, rolled, through, the, machine, the, piece, is, then, transferred, to, the, next, set, of, grooves, or, turned, around, and, reinserted, into, the, same, grooves, this, continues, until, the, desired, shape, and, size, is, achieved, the, advantage, of, this, process, is, there, is, no, flash, and, it, imparts, a, favorable, grain, structure, into, the, workpiece, examples, of, products, produced, using, this, method, include, axles, tapered, levers, and, leaf, springs, this, process, is, also, known, as, precision, forging, it, was, developed, to, minimize, cost, and, waste, associated, with, post, forging, operations, therefore, the, final, product, from, a, precision, forging, needs, little, or, no, final, machining, cost, savings, are, gained, from, the, use, of, less, material, and, thus, less, scrap, the, overall, decrease, in, energy, used, and, the, reduction, or, elimination, of, machining, precision, forging, also, requires, less, of, a, draft, 1, to, 0, the, downside, of, this, process, is, its, cost, therefore, it, is, only, implemented, if, significant, cost, reduction, can, be, achieved, near, net, shape, forging, is, most, common, when, parts, are, forged, without, heating, the, slug, bar, or, billet, aluminum, is, a, common, material, that, can, be, cold, forged, depending, on, final, shape, lubrication, of, the, parts, being, formed, is, critical, to, increase, the, life, of, the, mating, dies, unlike, the, above, processes, induction, forging, is, based, on, the, type, of, heating, style, used, many, of, the, above, processes, can, be, used, in, conjunction, with, this, heating, method, multidirectional, forging, is, forming, of, a, work, piece, in, a, single, step, in, several, directions, the, multidirectional, forming, takes, place, through, constructive, measures, of, the, tool, the, vertical, movement, of, the, press, ram, is, redirected, using, wedges, which, distributes, and, redirects, the, force, of, the, forging, press, in, horizontal, directions, isothermal, forging, is, a, process, by, which, the, materials, and, the, die, are, heated, to, the, same, temperature, iso, meaning, equal, adiabatic, heating, is, used, to, assist, in, the, deformation, of, the, material, meaning, the, strain, rates, are, highly, controlled, this, technique, is, commonly, used, for, forging, aluminium, which, has, a, lower, forging, temperature, than, steels, forging, temperatures, for, aluminum, are, around, 430, c, 806, f, while, steels, and, super, alloys, can, be, 930, to, 1, 260, c, 1, 710, to, 2, 300, f, benefits, disadvantages, depending, on, the, forming, temperature, steel, forging, can, be, divided, into, for, industrial, processes, steel, alloys, are, primarily, forged, in, hot, condition, brass, bronze, copper, precious, metals, and, their, alloys, are, manufactured, by, cold, forging, processes, each, metal, requires, a, different, forging, temperature, due, to, the, narrow, temperature, range, and, high, thermal, conductivity, aluminium, forging, can, only, be, realized, in, a, particular, process, window, to, provide, good, forming, conditions, a, homogeneous, temperature, distribution, in, the, entire, workpiece, is, necessary, therefore, the, control, of, the, tool, temperature, has, a, major, influence, to, the, process, for, example, by, optimizing, the, preform, geometries, the, local, effective, strains, can, be, influenced, to, reduce, local, overheating, for, a, more, homogeneous, temperature, distribution, high, strength, aluminium, alloys, have, the, tensile, strength, of, medium, strong, steel, alloys, while, providing, significant, weight, advantages, therefore, aluminium, forged, parts, are, mainly, used, in, aerospace, automotive, industry, and, many, other, fields, of, engineering, especially, in, those, fields, where, highest, safety, standards, against, failure, by, abuse, by, shock, or, vibratory, stresses, are, needed, such, parts, are, for, example, pistons, chassis, parts, steering, components, and, brake, parts, commonly, used, alloys, are, alsi1mgmn, en, aw, 6082, and, alznmgcu1, 5, en, aw, 7075, about, 80, of, all, aluminium, forged, parts, are, made, of, alsi1mgmn, the, high, strength, alloy, alznmgcu1, 5, is, mainly, used, for, aerospace, applications, magnesium, alloys, are, more, difficult, to, forge, due, to, their, low, plasticity, low, sensitivity, to, strain, rates, and, narrow, forming, temperature, using, semi, open, die, hot, forging, with, a, three, slide, forging, press, tsfp, has, become, a, newly, developed, forging, method, for, mg, al, alloy, az31, commonly, used, in, forming, aircraft, brackets, this, forging, method, has, shown, to, improve, tensile, properties, but, lacks, uniform, grain, size, even, though, the, application, of, magnesium, alloys, increases, by, 15, 20, each, year, in, the, aerospace, and, automotive, industry, forging, magnesium, alloys, with, specialized, dies, is, expensive, and, an, unfeasible, method, to, produce, parts, for, a, mass, market, instead, most, magnesium, alloy, parts, for, industry, are, produced, by, casting, methods, the, most, common, type, of, forging, equipment, is, the, hammer, and, anvil, principles, behind, the, hammer, and, anvil, are, still, used, today, in, drop, hammer, equipment, the, principle, behind, the, machine, is, simple, raise, the, hammer, and, drop, it, or, propel, it, into, the, workpiece, which, rests, on, the, anvil, the, main, variations, between, drop, hammers, are, in, the, way, the, hammer, is, powered, the, most, common, being, air, and, steam, hammers, drop, hammers, usually, operate, in, a, vertical, position, the, main, reason, for, this, is, excess, energy, energy, that, is, not, used, to, deform, the, workpiece, that, is, not, released, as, heat, or, sound, needs, to, be, transmitted, to, the, foundation, moreover, a, large, machine, base, is, needed, to, absorb, the, impacts, to, overcome, some, shortcomings, of, the, drop, hammer, the, counterblow, machine, or, impactor, is, used, in, a, counterblow, machine, both, the, hammer, and, anvil, move, and, the, workpiece, is, held, between, them, here, excess, energy, becomes, recoil, this, allows, the, machine, to, work, horizontally, and, have, a, smaller, base, other, advantages, include, less, noise, heat, and, vibration, it, also, produces, a, distinctly, different, flow, pattern, both, of, these, machines, can, be, used, for, open, die, or, closed, die, forging, a, forging, press, often, just, called, a, press, is, used, for, press, forging, there, are, two, main, types, mechanical, and, hydraulic, presses, mechanical, presses, function, by, using, cams, cranks, and, or, toggles, to, produce, a, preset, a, predetermined, force, at, a, certain, location, in, the, stroke, and, reproducible, stroke, due, to, the, nature, of, this, type, of, system, different, forces, are, available, at, different, stroke, positions, mechanical, presses, are, faster, than, their, hydraulic, counterparts, up, to, 50, strokes, per, minute, their, capacities, range, from, 3, to, 160, mn, 300, to, 18, 000, short, tons, force, hydraulic, presses, such, as, the, four, die, device, use, fluid, pressure, and, a, piston, to, generate, force, the, advantages, of, a, hydraulic, press, over, a, mechanical, press, are, its, flexibility, and, greater, capacity, the, disadvantages, include, a, slower, larger, and, costlier, machine, to, operate, the, roll, forging, upsetting, and, automatic, hot, forging, processes, all, use, specialized, machinery
