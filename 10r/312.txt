the, earliest, surviving, bathtub, dates, back, to, 1700, b, c, and, hails, from, the, palace, of, knossos, in, crete, what, is, remarkable, about, this, tub, is, not, only, the, similarity, with,

and, private, spaces, were, favored, thus, laying, the, foundations, for, the, bathroom, as, it, was, to, become, in, the, 20th, century, however, increased, urbanization, led, to, the, creation, of, more, baths, and, washhouses, in, britain, in, japan, shared, bathing, in, sento, and, onsen, spas, still, exists, the, latter, being, very, popular, cultural, historian, barbara, penner, has,
