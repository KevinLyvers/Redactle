a, launch, vehicle, is, typically, a, rocket, powered, vehicle, designed, to, carry, a, payload, a, crewed, spacecraft, or, satellites, from, earth, s, surface, or, lower, atmosphere, to, outer, space, the, most, common, form, is, the, ballistic, missile, shaped, multistage, rocket, but, the, term, is, more, general, and, also, encompasses, vehicles, like, the, space, shuttle, most, launch, vehicles, operate, from, a, launch, pad, supported, by, a, launch, control, center, and, systems, such, as, vehicle, assembly, and, fueling, launch, vehicles, are, engineered, with, advanced, aerodynamics, and, technologies, which, contribute, to, high, operating, costs, an, orbital, launch, vehicle, must, lift, its, payload, at, least, to, the, boundary, of, space, approximately, 150, km, 93, mi, and, accelerate, it, to, a, horizontal, velocity, of, at, least, 7, 814, m, s, 17, 480, mph, suborbital, vehicles, launch, their, payloads, to, lower, velocity, or, are, launched, at, elevation, angles, greater, than, horizontal, practical, orbital, launch, vehicles, use, chemical, propellants, such, as, solid, fuel, liquid, hydrogen, kerosene, liquid, oxygen, or, hypergolic, propellants, launch, vehicles, are, classified, by, their, orbital, payload, capacity, ranging, from, small, medium, heavy, to, super, heavy, lift, launch, vehicles, are, classed, by, nasa, according, to, low, earth, orbit, payload, capability, sounding, rockets, are, similar, to, small, lift, launch, vehicles, however, they, are, usually, even, smaller, and, do, not, place, payloads, into, orbit, a, modified, ss, 520, sounding, rocket, was, used, to, place, a, 4, kilogram, payload, tricom, 1r, into, orbit, in, 2018, orbital, spaceflight, requires, a, satellite, or, spacecraft, payload, to, be, accelerated, to, very, high, velocity, in, the, vacuum, of, space, reaction, forces, must, be, provided, by, the, ejection, of, mass, resulting, in, the, rocket, equation, the, physics, of, spaceflight, are, such, that, rocket, stages, are, typically, required, to, achieve, the, desired, orbit, expendable, launch, vehicles, are, designed, for, one, time, use, with, boosters, that, usually, separate, from, their, payload, and, disintegrate, during, atmospheric, reentry, or, on, contact, with, the, ground, in, contrast, reusable, launch, vehicles, are, designed, to, be, recovered, intact, and, launched, again, the, falcon, 9, is, an, example, of, a, reusable, launch, vehicle, as, of, 2023, all, reusable, launch, vehicles, that, were, ever, operational, have, been, partially, reusable, meaning, some, components, are, recovered, and, others, are, not, this, usually, means, the, recovery, of, specific, stages, usually, just, the, first, stage, but, sometimes, specific, components, of, a, rocket, stage, may, be, recovered, while, others, are, not, the, space, shuttle, for, example, recovered, and, reused, its, solid, rocket, boosters, the, space, shuttle, orbiter, that, also, acted, as, a, second, stage, and, the, engines, used, by, the, core, stage, the, rs, 25, which, was, located, at, the, back, of, the, orbiter, however, the, fuel, tank, that, the, engines, sourced, fuel, from, which, was, separate, from, the, engines, was, not, reused, for, example, the, european, space, agency, is, responsible, for, the, ariane, v, and, the, united, launch, alliance, manufactures, and, launches, the, delta, iv, and, atlas, v, rockets, launchpads, can, be, located, on, land, spaceport, on, a, fixed, ocean, platform, san, marco, on, a, mobile, ocean, platform, sea, launch, and, on, a, submarine, launch, vehicles, can, also, be, launched, from, the, air, a, launch, vehicle, will, start, off, with, its, payload, at, some, location, on, the, surface, of, the, earth, to, reach, orbit, the, vehicle, must, travel, vertically, to, leave, the, atmosphere, and, horizontally, to, prevent, re, contacting, the, ground, the, required, velocity, varies, depending, on, the, orbit, but, will, always, be, extreme, when, compared, to, velocities, encountered, in, normal, life, launch, vehicles, provide, varying, degrees, of, performance, for, example, a, satellite, bound, for, geostationary, orbit, geo, can, either, be, directly, inserted, by, the, upper, stage, of, the, launch, vehicle, or, launched, to, a, geostationary, transfer, orbit, gto, a, direct, insertion, places, greater, demands, on, the, launch, vehicle, while, gto, is, more, demanding, of, the, spacecraft, once, in, orbit, launch, vehicle, upper, stages, and, satellites, can, have, overlapping, capabilities, although, upper, stages, tend, to, have, orbital, lifetimes, measured, in, hours, or, days, while, spacecraft, can, last, decades, distributed, launch, involves, the, accomplishment, of, a, goal, with, multiple, spacecraft, launches, a, large, spacecraft, such, as, the, international, space, station, can, be, constructed, by, assembling, modules, in, orbit, or, in, space, propellant, transfer, conducted, to, greatly, increase, the, delta, v, capabilities, of, a, cislunar, or, deep, space, vehicle, distributed, launch, enables, space, missions, that, are, not, possible, with, single, launch, architectures, mission, architectures, for, distributed, launch, were, explored, in, the, 2000s, and, launch, vehicles, with, integrated, distributed, launch, capability, built, in, began, development, in, 2017, with, the, starship, design, the, standard, starship, launch, architecture, is, to, refuel, the, spacecraft, in, low, earth, orbit, to, enable, the, craft, to, send, high, mass, payloads, on, much, more, energetic, missions, after, 1980, but, before, the, 2010s, two, orbital, launch, vehicles, developed, the, capability, to, return, to, the, launch, site, rtls, both, the, us, space, shuttle, with, one, of, its, abort, modes, and, the, soviet, buran, had, a, designed, in, capability, to, return, a, part, of, the, launch, vehicle, to, the, launch, site, via, the, mechanism, of, horizontal, landing, of, the, spaceplane, portion, of, the, launch, vehicle, in, both, cases, the, main, vehicle, thrust, structure, and, the, large, propellant, tank, were, expendable, as, had, been, the, standard, procedure, for, all, orbital, launch, vehicles, flown, prior, to, that, time, both, were, subsequently, demonstrated, on, actual, orbital, nominal, flights, although, both, also, had, an, abort, mode, during, launch, that, could, conceivably, allow, the, crew, to, land, the, spaceplane, following, an, off, nominal, launch, in, the, 2000s, both, spacex, and, blue, origin, have, privately, developed, a, set, of, technologies, to, support, vertical, landing, of, the, booster, stage, of, a, launch, vehicle, after, 2010, spacex, undertook, a, development, program, to, acquire, the, ability, to, bring, back, and, vertically, land, a, part, of, the, falcon, 9, orbital, launch, vehicle, the, first, stage, the, first, successful, landing, was, done, in, december, 2015, since, 2017, rocket, stages, routinely, land, either, at, a, landing, pad, adjacent, to, the, launch, site, or, on, a, landing, platform, at, sea, some, distance, away, from, the, launch, site, the, falcon, heavy, is, similarly, designed, to, reuse, the, three, cores, comprising, its, first, stage, on, its, first, flight, in, february, 2018, the, two, outer, cores, successfully, returned, to, the, launch, site, landing, pads, while, the, center, core, targeted, the, landing, platform, at, sea, but, did, not, successfully, land, on, it, blue, origin, developed, similar, technologies, for, bringing, back, and, landing, their, suborbital, new, shepard, and, successfully, demonstrated, return, in, 2015, and, successfully, reused, the, same, booster, on, a, second, suborbital, flight, in, january, 2016, by, october, 2016, blue, had, reflown, and, landed, successfully, that, same, launch, vehicle, a, total, of, five, times, it, must, however, be, noted, that, the, launch, trajectories, of, both, vehicles, are, very, different, with, new, shepard, going, straight, up, and, down, whereas, falcon, 9, has, to, cancel, substantial, horizontal, velocity, and, return, from, a, significant, distance, downrange, both, blue, origin, and, spacex, also, have, additional, reusable, launch, vehicles, under, development, blue, is, developing, the, first, stage, of, the, orbital, new, glenn, lv, to, be, reusable, with, first, flight, planned, for, no, earlier, than, 2024, spacex, has, a, new, super, heavy, launch, vehicle, under, development, for, missions, to, interplanetary, space, the, spacex, starship, is, designed, to, support, rtls, vertical, landing, and, full, reuse, of, both, the, booster, stage, and, the, integrated, second, stage, large, spacecraft, that, are, designed, for, use, with, starship, its, first, launch, attempt, took, place, in, april, 2023, however, both, stages, were, lost, during, ascent
