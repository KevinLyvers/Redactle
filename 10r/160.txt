biomedical, engineering, bme, or, medical, engineering, is, the, application, of, engineering, principles, and, design, concepts, to, medicine, and, biology, for, healthcare, applications, e, g, diagnostic, or, therapeutic, purposes, bme, is, also, traditionally, logical, sciences, to, advance, health, care, treatment, including, diagnosis, monitoring, and, therapy, also, included, under, the, scope, of, a, biomedical, engineer, is, the, management, of, current, medical, equipment, in, hospitals, while, adhering, to, relevant, industry, standards, this, involves, procurement, routine, testing, preventive, maintenance, and, making, equipment, recommendations, a, role, also, known, as, a, biomedical, equipment, technician, bmet, or, as, a, clinical, engineer, biomedical, engineering, has, recently, emerged, as, its, own, field, of, study, as, compared, to, many, other, engineering, fields, such, an, evolution, is, common, as, a, new, field, transitions, from, being, an, interdisciplinary, specialization, among, already, established, fields, to, being, considered, a, field, in, itself, much, of, the, work, in, biomedical, engineering, consists, of, research, and, development, spanning, a, broad, array, of, subfields, see, below, prominent, biomedical, engineering, applications, include, the, development, of, biocompatible, prostheses, various, diagnostic, and, therapeutic, medical, devices, ranging, from, clinical, equipment, to, micro, implants, imaging, technologies, such, as, mri, and, ekg, ecg, regenerative, tissue, growth, and, the, development, of, pharmaceutical, drugs, including, biopharmaceuticals, bioinformatics, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, that, develops, methods, and, software, tools, for, understanding, biological, data, as, an, interdisciplinary, field, of, science, bioinformatics, combines, computer, science, statistics, mathematics, and, engineering, to, analyze, and, interpret, biological, data, bioinformatics, is, considered, both, an, umbrella, term, for, the, body, of, biological, studies, that, use, computer, programming, as, part, of, their, methodology, as, well, as, a, reference, to, specific, analysis, pipelines, that, are, repeatedly, used, particularly, in, the, field, of, genomics, common, uses, of, bioinformatics, include, the, identification, of, candidate, genes, and, nucleotides, snps, often, such, identification, is, made, with, the, aim, of, better, understanding, the, genetic, basis, of, disease, unique, adaptations, desirable, properties, esp, in, agricultural, species, or, differences, between, populations, in, a, less, formal, way, bioinformatics, also, tries, to, understand, the, organizational, principles, within, nucleic, acid, and, protein, sequences, biomechanics, is, the, study, of, the, structure, and, function, of, the, mechanical, aspects, of, biological, systems, at, any, level, from, whole, organisms, to, organs, cells, and, cell, organelles, using, the, methods, of, mechanics, a, biomaterial, is, any, matter, surface, or, construct, that, interacts, with, living, systems, as, a, science, biomaterials, is, about, fifty, years, old, the, study, of, biomaterials, is, called, biomaterials, science, or, biomaterials, engineering, it, has, experienced, steady, and, strong, growth, over, its, history, with, many, companies, investing, large, amounts, of, money, into, the, development, of, new, products, biomaterials, science, encompasses, elements, of, medicine, biology, chemistry, tissue, engineering, and, materials, science, biomedical, optics, combines, the, principles, of, physics, engineering, and, biology, to, study, the, interaction, of, biological, tissue, and, light, and, how, this, can, be, exploited, for, sensing, imaging, and, treatment, it, has, a, wide, range, of, applications, including, optical, imaging, microscopy, ophthalmoscopy, spectroscopy, and, therapy, examples, of, biomedical, optics, techniques, and, technologies, include, optical, coherence, tomography, oct, fluorescence, microscopy, confocal, microscopy, and, photodynamic, therapy, pdt, oct, for, example, uses, light, to, create, high, resolution, three, dimensional, images, of, internal, structures, such, as, the, retina, in, the, eye, or, the, coronary, arteries, in, the, heart, fluorescence, microscopy, involves, labeling, specific, molecules, with, fluorescent, dyes, and, visualizing, them, using, light, providing, insights, into, biological, processes, and, disease, mechanisms, more, recently, adaptive, optics, is, helping, imaging, by, correcting, aberrations, in, biological, tissue, enabling, higher, resolution, imaging, and, improved, accuracy, in, procedures, such, as, laser, surgery, and, retinal, imaging, tissue, engineering, like, genetic, engineering, see, below, is, a, major, segment, of, biotechnology, which, overlaps, significantly, with, bme, one, of, the, goals, of, tissue, engineering, is, to, create, artificial, organs, via, biological, material, for, patients, that, need, organ, transplants, biomedical, engineers, are, currently, researching, methods, of, creating, such, organs, researchers, have, grown, solid, jawbones, and, tracheas, from, human, stem, cells, towards, this, end, several, artificial, urinary, bladders, have, been, grown, in, laboratories, and, transplanted, successfully, into, human, patients, bioartificial, organs, which, use, both, synthetic, and, biological, component, are, also, a, focus, area, in, research, such, as, with, hepatic, assist, devices, that, use, liver, cells, within, an, artificial, bioreactor, construct, genetic, engineering, recombinant, dna, technology, genetic, modification, manipulation, gm, and, gene, splicing, are, terms, that, apply, to, the, direct, manipulation, of, an, organism, s, genes, unlike, traditional, breeding, an, indirect, method, of, genetic, manipulation, genetic, engineering, utilizes, modern, tools, such, as, molecular, cloning, and, transformation, to, directly, alter, the, structure, and, characteristics, of, target, genes, genetic, engineering, techniques, have, found, success, in, numerous, applications, some, examples, include, the, improvement, of, crop, technology, not, a, medical, application, but, see, biological, systems, engineering, the, manufacture, of, synthetic, human, insulin, through, the, use, of, modified, bacteria, the, manufacture, of, erythropoietin, in, hamster, ovary, cells, and, the, production, of, new, types, of, experimental, mice, such, as, the, oncomouse, cancer, mouse, for, research, neural, engineering, also, known, as, neuroengineering, is, a, discipline, that, uses, engineering, techniques, to, understand, repair, replace, or, enhance, neural, systems, neural, engineers, are, uniquely, qualified, to, solve, design, problems, at, the, interface, of, living, neural, tissue, and, non, living, constructs, pharmaceutical, engineering, is, an, interdisciplinary, science, that, includes, drug, engineering, novel, drug, delivery, and, targeting, pharmaceutical, technology, unit, operations, of, chemical, engineering, and, pharmaceutical, analysis, it, may, be, deemed, as, a, part, of, pharmacy, due, to, its, focus, on, the, use, of, technology, on, chemical, agents, in, providing, better, medicinal, treatment, this, is, an, extremely, broad, category, essentially, covering, all, health, care, products, that, do, not, achieve, their, intended, results, through, predominantly, chemical, e, g, pharmaceuticals, or, biological, e, g, vaccines, means, and, do, not, involve, metabolism, a, medical, device, is, intended, for, use, in, some, examples, include, pacemakers, infusion, pumps, the, heart, lung, machine, dialysis, machines, artificial, organs, implants, artificial, limbs, corrective, lenses, cochlear, implants, ocular, prosthetics, facial, prosthetics, somato, prosthetics, and, dental, implants, stereolithography, is, a, practical, example, of, medical, modeling, being, used, to, create, physical, objects, beyond, modeling, organs, and, the, human, body, emerging, engineering, techniques, are, also, currently, used, in, the, research, and, development, of, new, devices, for, innovative, therapies, treatments, patient, monitoring, of, complex, diseases, medical, devices, are, regulated, and, classified, in, the, us, as, follows, see, also, regulation, medical, biomedical, imaging, is, a, major, segment, of, medical, devices, this, area, deals, with, enabling, clinicians, to, directly, or, indirectly, view, things, not, visible, in, plain, sight, such, as, due, to, their, size, and, or, location, this, can, involve, utilizing, ultrasound, magnetism, uv, radiology, and, other, means, alternatively, navigation, guided, equipment, utilizes, electromagnetic, tracking, technology, such, as, catheter, placement, into, the, brain, or, feeding, tube, placement, systems, for, example, envizion, medical, s, envue, an, electromagnetic, navigation, system, for, enteral, feeding, tube, placement, the, system, uses, an, external, field, generator, and, several, em, passive, sensors, enabling, scaling, of, the, display, to, the, patient, s, body, contour, and, a, real, time, view, of, the, feeding, tube, tip, location, and, direction, which, helps, the, medical, staff, ensure, the, correct, placement, in, the, gi, tract, imaging, technologies, are, often, essential, to, medical, diagnosis, and, are, typically, the, most, complex, equipment, found, in, a, hospital, including, fluoroscopy, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, nuclear, medicine, positron, emission, tomography, pet, pet, ct, scans, projection, radiography, such, as, x, rays, and, ct, scans, tomography, ultrasound, optical, microscopy, and, electron, microscopy, an, implant, is, a, kind, of, medical, device, made, to, replace, and, act, as, a, missing, biological, structure, as, compared, with, a, transplant, which, indicates, transplanted, biomedical, tissue, the, surface, of, implants, that, contact, the, body, might, be, made, of, a, biomedical, material, such, as, titanium, silicone, or, apatite, depending, on, what, is, the, most, functional, in, some, cases, implants, contain, electronics, e, g, artificial, pacemakers, and, cochlear, implants, some, implants, are, bioactive, such, as, subcutaneous, drug, delivery, devices, in, the, form, of, implantable, pills, or, drug, eluting, stents, artificial, body, part, replacements, are, one, of, the, many, applications, of, bionics, concerned, with, the, intricate, and, thorough, study, of, the, properties, and, function, of, human, body, systems, bionics, may, be, applied, to, solve, some, engineering, problems, careful, study, of, the, different, functions, and, processes, of, the, eyes, ears, and, other, organs, paved, the, way, for, improved, cameras, television, radio, transmitters, and, receivers, and, many, other, tools, in, recent, years, biomedical, sensors, based, in, microwave, technology, have, gained, more, attention, different, sensors, can, be, manufactured, for, specific, uses, in, both, diagnosing, and, monitoring, disease, conditions, for, example, microwave, sensors, can, be, used, as, a, complementary, technique, to, x, ray, to, monitor, lower, extremity, trauma, the, sensor, monitor, the, dielectric, properties, and, can, thus, notice, change, in, tissue, bone, muscle, fat, etc, under, the, skin, so, when, measuring, at, different, times, during, the, healing, process, the, response, from, the, sensor, will, change, as, the, trauma, heals, clinical, engineering, is, the, branch, of, biomedical, engineering, dealing, with, the, actual, implementation, of, medical, equipment, and, technologies, in, hospitals, or, other, clinical, settings, major, roles, of, clinical, engineers, include, training, and, supervising, biomedical, equipment, technicians, bmets, selecting, technological, products, services, and, logistically, managing, their, implementation, working, with, governmental, regulators, on, inspections, audits, and, serving, as, technological, consultants, for, other, hospital, staff, e, g, physicians, administrators, i, t, etc, clinical, engineers, also, advise, and, collaborate, with, medical, device, producers, regarding, prospective, design, improvements, based, on, clinical, experiences, as, well, as, monitor, the, progression, of, the, state, of, the, art, so, as, to, redirect, procurement, patterns, accordingly, their, inherent, focus, on, practical, implementation, of, technology, has, tended, to, keep, them, oriented, more, towards, incremental, level, redesigns, and, reconfigurations, as, opposed, to, revolutionary, research, development, or, ideas, that, would, be, many, years, from, clinical, adoption, however, there, is, a, growing, effort, to, expand, this, time, horizon, over, which, clinical, engineers, can, influence, the, trajectory, of, biomedical, innovation, in, their, various, roles, they, form, a, bridge, between, the, primary, designers, and, the, end, users, by, combining, the, perspectives, of, being, both, close, to, the, point, of, use, while, also, trained, in, product, and, process, engineering, clinical, engineering, departments, will, sometimes, hire, not, just, biomedical, engineers, but, also, industrial, systems, engineers, to, help, address, operations, research, optimization, human, factors, cost, analysis, etc, also, see, safety, engineering, for, a, discussion, of, the, procedures, used, to, design, safe, systems, the, clinical, engineering, department, is, constructed, with, a, manager, supervisor, engineer, and, technician, one, engineer, per, eighty, beds, in, the, hospital, is, the, ratio, clinical, engineers, are, also, authorized, to, audit, pharmaceutical, and, associated, stores, to, monitor, fda, recalls, of, invasive, items, rehabilitation, engineering, is, the, systematic, application, of, engineering, sciences, to, design, develop, adapt, test, evaluate, apply, and, distribute, technological, solutions, to, problems, confronted, by, individuals, with, disabilities, functional, areas, addressed, through, rehabilitation, engineering, may, include, mobility, communications, hearing, vision, and, cognition, and, activities, associated, with, employment, independent, living, education, and, integration, into, the, community, while, some, rehabilitation, engineers, have, master, s, degrees, in, rehabilitation, engineering, usually, a, subspecialty, of, biomedical, engineering, most, rehabilitation, engineers, have, an, undergraduate, or, graduate, degrees, in, biomedical, engineering, mechanical, engineering, or, electrical, engineering, a, portuguese, university, provides, an, undergraduate, degree, and, a, master, s, degree, in, rehabilitation, engineering, and, accessibility, qualification, to, become, a, rehab, engineer, in, the, uk, is, possible, via, a, university, bsc, honours, degree, course, such, as, health, design, technology, institute, coventry, university, the, rehabilitation, process, for, people, with, disabilities, often, entails, the, design, of, assistive, devices, such, as, walking, aids, intended, to, promote, the, inclusion, of, their, users, into, the, mainstream, of, society, commerce, and, recreation, regulatory, issues, have, been, constantly, increased, in, the, last, decades, to, respond, to, the, many, incidents, caused, by, devices, to, patients, for, example, from, 2008, to, 2011, in, us, there, were, 119, fda, recalls, of, medical, devices, classified, as, class, i, according, to, u, s, food, and, drug, administration, fda, class, i, recall, is, associated, to, a, situation, in, which, there, is, a, reasonable, probability, that, the, use, of, or, exposure, to, a, product, will, cause, serious, adverse, health, consequences, or, death, regardless, of, the, country, specific, legislation, the, main, regulatory, objectives, coincide, worldwide, for, example, in, the, medical, device, regulations, a, product, must, be, 1, safe, and, 2, effective, and, 3, for, all, the, manufactured, devices, why, is, this, part, deleted, a, product, is, safe, if, patients, users, and, third, parties, do, not, run, unacceptable, risks, of, physical, hazards, death, injuries, in, its, intended, use, protective, measures, have, to, be, introduced, on, the, devices, to, reduce, residual, risks, at, an, acceptable, level, if, compared, with, the, benefit, derived, from, the, use, of, it, a, product, is, effective, if, it, performs, as, specified, by, the, manufacturer, in, the, intended, use, effectiveness, is, achieved, through, clinical, evaluation, compliance, to, performance, standards, or, demonstrations, of, substantial, equivalence, with, an, already, marketed, device, the, previous, features, have, to, be, ensured, for, all, the, manufactured, items, of, the, medical, device, this, requires, that, a, quality, system, shall, be, in, place, for, all, the, relevant, entities, and, processes, that, may, impact, safety, and, effectiveness, over, the, whole, medical, device, lifecycle, the, medical, device, engineering, area, is, among, the, most, heavily, regulated, fields, of, engineering, and, practicing, biomedical, engineers, must, routinely, consult, and, cooperate, with, regulatory, law, attorneys, and, other, experts, the, food, and, drug, administration, fda, is, the, principal, healthcare, regulatory, authority, in, the, united, states, having, jurisdiction, over, medical, devices, drugs, biologics, and, combination, products, the, paramount, objectives, driving, policy, decisions, by, the, fda, are, safety, and, effectiveness, of, healthcare, products, that, have, to, be, assured, through, a, quality, system, in, place, as, specified, under, 21, cfr, 829, regulation, in, addition, because, biomedical, engineers, often, develop, devices, and, technologies, for, consumer, use, such, as, physical, therapy, devices, which, are, also, medical, devices, these, may, also, be, governed, in, some, respects, by, the, consumer, product, safety, commission, the, greatest, hurdles, tend, to, be, 510k, clearance, typically, for, class, 2, devices, or, pre, market, approval, typically, for, drugs, and, class, 3, devices, in, the, european, context, safety, effectiveness, and, quality, is, ensured, through, the, conformity, assessment, which, is, defined, as, the, method, by, which, a, manufacturer, demonstrates, that, its, device, complies, with, the, requirements, of, the, european, medical, device, directive, the, directive, specifies, different, procedures, according, to, the, class, of, the, device, ranging, from, the, simple, declaration, of, conformity, annex, vii, for, class, i, devices, to, ec, verification, annex, iv, production, quality, assurance, annex, v, product, quality, assurance, annex, vi, and, full, quality, assurance, annex, ii, the, medical, device, directive, specifies, detailed, procedures, for, certification, in, general, terms, these, procedures, include, tests, and, verifications, that, are, to, be, contained, in, specific, deliveries, such, as, the, risk, management, file, the, technical, file, and, the, quality, system, deliveries, the, risk, management, file, is, the, first, deliverable, that, conditions, the, following, design, and, manufacturing, steps, the, risk, management, stage, shall, drive, the, product, so, that, product, risks, are, reduced, at, an, acceptable, level, with, respect, to, the, benefits, expected, for, the, patients, for, the, use, of, the, device, the, technical, file, contains, all, the, documentation, data, and, records, supporting, medical, device, certification, fda, technical, file, has, similar, content, although, organized, in, a, different, structure, the, quality, system, deliverables, usually, include, procedures, that, ensure, quality, throughout, all, product, life, cycles, the, same, standard, iso, en, 13485, is, usually, applied, for, quality, management, systems, in, the, us, and, worldwide, in, the, european, union, there, are, certifying, entities, named, notified, bodies, accredited, by, the, european, member, states, the, notified, bodies, must, ensure, the, effectiveness, of, the, certification, process, for, all, medical, devices, apart, from, the, class, i, devices, where, a, declaration, of, conformity, produced, by, the, manufacturer, is, sufficient, for, marketing, once, a, product, has, passed, all, the, steps, required, by, the, medical, device, directive, the, device, is, entitled, to, bear, a, ce, marking, indicating, that, the, device, is, believed, to, be, safe, and, effective, when, used, as, intended, and, therefore, it, can, be, marketed, within, the, european, union, area, the, different, regulatory, arrangements, sometimes, result, in, particular, technologies, being, developed, first, for, either, the, u, s, or, in, europe, depending, on, the, more, favorable, form, of, regulation, while, nations, often, strive, for, substantive, harmony, to, facilitate, cross, national, distribution, philosophical, differences, about, the, optimal, extent, of, regulation, can, be, a, hindrance, more, restrictive, regulations, seem, appealing, on, an, intuitive, level, but, critics, decry, the, tradeoff, cost, in, terms, of, slowing, access, to, life, saving, developments, directive, 2011, 65, eu, better, known, as, rohs, 2, is, a, recast, of, legislation, originally, introduced, in, 2002, the, original, eu, legislation, restrictions, of, certain, hazardous, substances, in, electrical, and, electronics, devices, rohs, directive, 2002, 95, ec, was, replaced, and, superseded, by, 2011, 65, eu, published, in, july, 2011, and, commonly, known, as, rohs, 2, rohs, seeks, to, limit, the, dangerous, substances, in, circulation, in, electronics, products, in, particular, toxins, and, heavy, metals, which, are, subsequently, released, into, the, environment, when, such, devices, are, recycled, the, scope, of, rohs, 2, is, widened, to, include, products, previously, excluded, such, as, medical, devices, and, industrial, equipment, in, addition, manufacturers, are, now, obliged, to, provide, conformity, risk, assessments, and, test, reports, or, explain, why, they, are, lacking, for, the, first, time, not, only, manufacturers, but, also, importers, and, distributors, share, a, responsibility, to, ensure, electrical, and, electronic, equipment, within, the, scope, of, rohs, complies, with, the, hazardous, substances, limits, and, have, a, ce, mark, on, their, products, the, new, international, standard, iec, 60601, for, home, healthcare, electro, medical, devices, defining, the, requirements, for, devices, used, in, the, home, healthcare, environment, iec, 60601, 1, 11, 2010, must, now, be, incorporated, into, the, design, and, verification, of, a, wide, range, of, home, use, and, point, of, care, medical, devices, along, with, other, applicable, standards, in, the, iec, 60601, 3rd, edition, series, the, mandatory, date, for, implementation, of, the, en, european, version, of, the, standard, is, june, 1, 2013, the, us, fda, requires, the, use, of, the, standard, on, june, 30, 2013, while, health, canada, recently, extended, the, required, date, from, june, 2012, to, april, 2013, the, north, american, agencies, will, only, require, these, standards, for, new, device, submissions, while, the, eu, will, take, the, more, severe, approach, of, requiring, all, applicable, devices, being, placed, on, the, market, to, consider, the, home, healthcare, standard, as, ans, 3551, 2012, is, the, australian, and, new, zealand, standards, for, the, management, of, medical, devices, the, standard, specifies, the, procedures, required, to, maintain, a, wide, range, of, medical, assets, in, a, clinical, setting, e, g, hospital, the, standards, are, based, on, the, iec, 606101, standards, the, standard, covers, a, wide, range, of, medical, equipment, management, elements, including, procurement, acceptance, testing, maintenance, electrical, safety, and, preventive, maintenance, testing, and, decommissioning, biomedical, engineers, require, considerable, knowledge, of, both, engineering, and, biology, and, typically, have, a, bachelor, s, b, sc, b, s, b, eng, or, b, s, e, or, master, s, m, s, m, sc, m, s, e, or, m, eng, or, a, doctoral, ph, d, or, md, phd, degree, in, bme, biomedical, engineering, or, another, branch, of, engineering, with, considerable, potential, for, bme, overlap, as, interest, in, bme, increases, many, engineering, colleges, now, have, a, biomedical, engineering, department, or, program, with, offerings, ranging, from, the, undergraduate, b, sc, b, s, b, eng, or, b, s, e, to, doctoral, levels, biomedical, engineering, has, only, recently, been, emerging, as, its, own, discipline, rather, than, a, cross, disciplinary, hybrid, specialization, of, other, disciplines, and, bme, programs, at, all, levels, are, becoming, more, widespread, including, the, bachelor, of, science, in, biomedical, engineering, which, includes, enough, biological, science, content, that, many, students, use, it, as, a, pre, med, major, in, preparation, for, medical, school, the, number, of, biomedical, engineers, is, expected, to, rise, as, both, a, cause, and, effect, of, improvements, in, medical, technology, in, the, u, s, an, increasing, number, of, undergraduate, programs, are, also, becoming, recognized, by, abet, as, accredited, bioengineering, biomedical, engineering, programs, as, of, 2023, 155, programs, are, currently, accredited, by, abet, in, canada, and, australia, accredited, graduate, programs, in, biomedical, engineering, are, common, for, example, mcmaster, university, offers, an, m, a, sc, an, md, phd, and, a, phd, in, biomedical, engineering, the, first, canadian, undergraduate, bme, program, was, offered, at, university, of, guelph, as, a, four, year, b, eng, program, the, polytechnique, in, montreal, is, also, offering, a, bachelors, s, degree, in, biomedical, engineering, as, is, flinders, university, as, with, many, degrees, the, reputation, and, ranking, of, a, program, may, factor, into, the, desirability, of, a, degree, holder, for, either, employment, or, graduate, admission, the, reputation, of, many, undergraduate, degrees, is, also, linked, to, the, institution, s, graduate, or, research, programs, which, have, some, tangible, factors, for, rating, such, as, research, funding, and, volume, publications, and, citations, with, bme, specifically, the, ranking, of, a, university, s, hospital, and, medical, school, can, also, be, a, significant, factor, in, the, perceived, prestige, of, its, bme, department, program, graduate, education, is, a, particularly, important, aspect, in, bme, while, many, engineering, fields, such, as, mechanical, or, electrical, engineering, do, not, need, graduate, level, training, to, obtain, an, entry, level, job, in, their, field, the, majority, of, bme, positions, do, prefer, or, even, require, them, since, most, bme, related, professions, involve, scientific, research, such, as, in, pharmaceutical, and, medical, device, development, graduate, education, is, almost, a, requirement, as, undergraduate, degrees, typically, do, not, involve, sufficient, research, training, and, experience, this, can, be, either, a, masters, or, doctoral, level, degree, while, in, certain, specialties, a, ph, d, is, notably, more, common, than, in, others, it, is, hardly, ever, the, majority, except, in, academia, in, fact, the, perceived, need, for, some, kind, of, graduate, credential, is, so, strong, that, some, undergraduate, bme, programs, will, actively, discourage, students, from, majoring, in, bme, without, an, expressed, intention, to, also, obtain, a, master, s, degree, or, apply, to, medical, school, afterwards, graduate, programs, in, bme, like, in, other, scientific, fields, are, highly, varied, and, particular, programs, may, emphasize, certain, aspects, within, the, field, they, may, also, feature, extensive, collaborative, efforts, with, programs, in, other, fields, such, as, the, university, s, medical, school, or, other, engineering, divisions, owing, again, to, the, interdisciplinary, nature, of, bme, m, s, and, ph, d, programs, will, typically, require, applicants, to, have, an, undergraduate, degree, in, bme, or, another, engineering, discipline, plus, certain, life, science, coursework, or, life, science, plus, certain, engineering, coursework, education, in, bme, also, varies, greatly, around, the, world, by, virtue, of, its, extensive, biotechnology, sector, its, numerous, major, universities, and, relatively, few, internal, barriers, the, u, s, has, progressed, a, great, deal, in, its, development, of, bme, education, and, training, opportunities, europe, which, also, has, a, large, biotechnology, sector, and, an, impressive, education, system, has, encountered, trouble, in, creating, uniform, standards, as, the, european, community, attempts, to, supplant, some, of, the, national, jurisdictional, barriers, that, still, exist, recently, initiatives, such, as, biomedea, have, sprung, up, to, develop, bme, related, education, and, professional, standards, other, countries, such, as, australia, are, recognizing, and, moving, to, correct, deficiencies, in, their, bme, education, also, as, high, technology, endeavors, are, usually, marks, of, developed, nations, some, areas, of, the, world, are, prone, to, slower, development, in, education, including, in, bme, as, with, other, learned, professions, each, state, has, certain, fairly, similar, requirements, for, becoming, licensed, as, a, registered, professional, engineer, pe, but, in, us, in, industry, such, a, license, is, not, required, to, be, an, employee, as, an, engineer, in, the, majority, of, situations, due, to, an, exception, known, as, the, industrial, exemption, which, effectively, applies, to, the, vast, majority, of, american, engineers, the, us, model, has, generally, been, only, to, require, the, practicing, engineers, offering, engineering, services, that, impact, the, public, welfare, safety, safeguarding, of, life, health, or, property, to, be, licensed, while, engineers, working, in, private, industry, without, a, direct, offering, of, engineering, services, to, the, public, or, other, businesses, education, and, government, need, not, be, licensed, this, is, notably, not, the, case, in, many, other, countries, where, a, license, is, as, legally, necessary, to, practice, engineering, as, it, is, for, law, or, medicine, biomedical, engineering, is, regulated, in, some, countries, such, as, australia, but, registration, is, typically, only, recommended, and, not, required, in, the, uk, mechanical, engineers, working, in, the, areas, of, medical, engineering, bioengineering, or, biomedical, engineering, can, gain, chartered, engineer, status, through, the, institution, of, mechanical, engineers, the, institution, also, runs, the, engineering, in, medicine, and, health, division, the, institute, of, physics, and, engineering, in, medicine, ipem, has, a, panel, for, the, accreditation, of, msc, courses, in, biomedical, engineering, and, chartered, engineering, status, can, also, be, sought, through, ipem, the, fundamentals, of, engineering, exam, the, first, and, more, general, of, two, licensure, examinations, for, most, u, s, jurisdictions, does, now, cover, biology, although, technically, not, bme, for, the, second, exam, called, the, principles, and, practices, part, 2, or, the, professional, engineering, exam, candidates, may, select, a, particular, engineering, discipline, s, content, to, be, tested, on, there, is, currently, not, an, option, for, bme, with, this, meaning, that, any, biomedical, engineers, seeking, a, license, must, prepare, to, take, this, examination, in, another, category, which, does, not, affect, the, actual, license, since, most, jurisdictions, do, not, recognize, discipline, specialties, anyway, however, the, biomedical, engineering, society, bmes, is, as, of, 2009, exploring, the, possibility, of, seeking, to, implement, a, bme, specific, version, of, this, exam, to, facilitate, biomedical, engineers, pursuing, licensure, beyond, governmental, registration, certain, private, sector, professional, industrial, organizations, also, offer, certifications, with, varying, degrees, of, prominence, one, such, example, is, the, certified, clinical, engineer, cce, certification, for, clinical, engineers, in, 2012, there, were, about, 19, 400, biomedical, engineers, employed, in, the, us, and, the, field, was, predicted, to, grow, by, 5, faster, than, average, from, 2012, to, 2022, biomedical, engineering, has, the, highest, percentage, of, female, engineers, compared, to, other, common, engineering, professions
