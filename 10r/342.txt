a, four, stroke, also, four, cycle, engine, is, an, internal, combustion, ic, engine, in, which, the, piston, completes, four, separate, strokes, while, turning, the, crankshaft, a, stroke, refers, to, the, full, travel, of, the, piston, along, the, cylinder, in, either, direction, the, four, separate, strokes, are, termed, four, stroke, engines, are, the, most, common, internal, combustion, engine, design, for, motorized, land, transport, being, used, in, automobiles, trucks, diesel, trains, light, aircraft, and, motorcycles, the, major, alternative, design, is, the, two, stroke, cycle, nikolaus, august, otto, was, a, traveling, salesman, for, a, grocery, concern, in, his, travels, he, encountered, the, internal, combustion, engine, built, in, paris, by, belgian, expatriate, jean, joseph, etienne, lenoir, in, 1860, lenoir, successfully, created, a, double, acting, engine, that, ran, on, illuminating, gas, at, 4, efficiency, the, 18, litre, lenoir, engine, produced, only, 2, horsepower, the, lenoir, engine, ran, on, illuminating, gas, made, from, coal, which, had, been, developed, in, paris, by, philip, lebon, in, testing, a, replica, of, the, lenoir, engine, in, 1861, otto, became, aware, of, the, effects, of, compression, on, the, fuel, charge, in, 1862, otto, attempted, to, produce, an, engine, to, improve, on, the, poor, efficiency, and, reliability, of, the, lenoir, engine, he, tried, to, create, an, engine, that, would, compress, the, fuel, mixture, prior, to, ignition, but, failed, as, that, engine, would, run, no, more, than, a, few, minutes, prior, to, its, destruction, many, other, engineers, were, trying, to, solve, the, problem, with, no, success, in, 1864, otto, and, eugen, langen, founded, the, first, internal, combustion, engine, production, company, na, otto, and, cie, na, otto, and, company, otto, and, cie, succeeded, in, creating, a, successful, atmospheric, engine, that, same, year, the, factory, ran, out, of, space, and, was, moved, to, the, town, of, deutz, germany, in, 1869, where, the, company, was, renamed, to, deutz, gasmotorenfabrik, ag, the, deutz, gas, engine, manufacturing, company, in, 1872, gottlieb, daimler, was, technical, director, and, wilhelm, maybach, was, the, head, of, engine, design, daimler, was, a, gunsmith, who, had, worked, on, the, lenoir, engine, by, 1876, otto, and, langen, succeeded, in, creating, the, first, internal, combustion, engine, that, compressed, the, fuel, mixture, prior, to, combustion, for, far, higher, efficiency, than, any, engine, created, to, this, time, daimler, and, maybach, left, their, employ, at, otto, and, cie, and, developed, the, first, high, speed, otto, engine, in, 1883, in, 1885, they, produced, the, first, automobile, to, be, equipped, with, an, otto, engine, the, daimler, reitwagen, used, a, hot, tube, ignition, system, and, the, fuel, known, as, ligroin, to, become, the, world, s, first, vehicle, powered, by, an, internal, combustion, engine, it, used, a, four, stroke, engine, based, on, otto, s, design, the, following, year, karl, benz, produced, a, four, stroke, engined, automobile, that, is, regarded, as, the, first, car, in, 1884, otto, s, company, then, known, as, gasmotorenfabrik, deutz, gfd, developed, electric, ignition, and, the, carburetor, in, 1890, daimler, and, maybach, formed, a, company, known, as, daimler, motoren, gesellschaft, today, that, company, is, daimler, benz, the, atkinson, cycle, engine, is, a, type, of, single, stroke, internal, combustion, engine, invented, by, james, atkinson, in, 1882, the, atkinson, cycle, is, designed, to, provide, efficiency, at, the, expense, of, power, density, and, is, used, in, some, modern, hybrid, electric, applications, the, original, atkinson, cycle, piston, engine, allowed, the, intake, compression, power, and, exhaust, strokes, of, the, four, stroke, cycle, to, occur, in, a, single, turn, of, the, crankshaft, and, was, designed, to, avoid, infringing, certain, patents, covering, otto, cycle, engines, due, to, the, unique, crankshaft, design, of, the, atkinson, its, expansion, ratio, can, differ, from, its, compression, ratio, and, with, a, power, stroke, longer, than, its, compression, stroke, the, engine, can, achieve, greater, thermal, efficiency, than, a, traditional, piston, engine, while, atkinson, s, original, design, is, no, more, than, a, historical, curiosity, many, modern, engines, use, unconventional, valve, timing, to, produce, the, effect, of, a, shorter, compression, stroke, longer, power, stroke, thus, realizing, the, fuel, economy, improvements, the, atkinson, cycle, can, provide, the, diesel, engine, is, a, technical, refinement, of, the, 1876, otto, cycle, engine, where, otto, had, realized, in, 1861, that, the, efficiency, of, the, engine, could, be, increased, by, first, compressing, the, fuel, mixture, prior, to, its, ignition, rudolf, diesel, wanted, to, develop, a, more, efficient, type, of, engine, that, could, run, on, much, heavier, fuel, the, lenoir, otto, atmospheric, and, otto, compression, engines, both, 1861, and, 1876, were, designed, to, run, on, illuminating, gas, coal, gas, with, the, same, motivation, as, otto, diesel, wanted, to, create, an, engine, that, would, give, small, industrial, companies, their, own, power, source, to, enable, them, to, compete, against, larger, companies, and, like, otto, to, get, away, from, the, requirement, to, be, tied, to, a, municipal, fuel, supply, like, otto, it, took, more, than, a, decade, to, produce, the, high, compression, engine, that, could, self, ignite, fuel, sprayed, into, the, cylinder, diesel, used, an, air, spray, combined, with, fuel, in, his, first, engine, during, initial, development, one, of, the, engines, burst, nearly, killing, diesel, he, persisted, and, finally, created, a, successful, engine, in, 1893, the, high, compression, engine, which, ignites, its, fuel, by, the, heat, of, compression, is, now, called, the, diesel, engine, whether, a, four, stroke, or, two, stroke, design, the, four, stroke, diesel, engine, has, been, used, in, the, majority, of, heavy, duty, applications, for, many, decades, it, uses, a, heavy, fuel, containing, more, energy, and, requiring, less, refinement, to, produce, the, most, efficient, otto, cycle, engines, run, near, 30, thermal, efficiency, the, thermodynamic, analysis, of, the, actual, four, stroke, and, two, stroke, cycles, is, not, a, simple, task, however, the, analysis, can, be, simplified, significantly, if, air, standard, assumptions, are, utilized, the, resulting, cycle, which, closely, resembles, the, actual, operating, conditions, is, the, otto, cycle, during, normal, operation, of, the, engine, as, the, air, fuel, mixture, is, being, compressed, an, electric, spark, is, created, to, ignite, the, mixture, at, low, rpm, this, occurs, close, to, tdc, top, dead, centre, as, engine, rpm, rises, the, speed, of, the, flame, front, does, not, change, so, the, spark, point, is, advanced, earlier, in, the, cycle, to, allow, a, greater, proportion, of, the, cycle, for, the, charge, to, combust, before, the, power, stroke, commences, this, advantage, is, reflected, in, the, various, otto, engine, designs, the, atmospheric, non, compression, engine, operates, at, 12, efficiency, whereas, the, compressed, charge, engine, has, an, operating, efficiency, around, 30, a, problem, with, compressed, charge, engines, is, that, the, temperature, rise, of, the, compressed, charge, can, cause, pre, ignition, if, this, occurs, at, the, wrong, time, and, is, too, energetic, it, can, damage, the, engine, different, fractions, of, petroleum, have, widely, varying, flash, points, the, temperatures, at, which, the, fuel, may, self, ignite, this, must, be, taken, into, account, in, engine, and, fuel, design, the, tendency, for, the, compressed, fuel, mixture, to, ignite, early, is, limited, by, the, chemical, composition, of, the, fuel, there, are, several, grades, of, fuel, to, accommodate, differing, performance, levels, of, engines, the, fuel, is, altered, to, change, its, self, ignition, temperature, there, are, several, ways, to, do, this, as, engines, are, designed, with, higher, compression, ratios, the, result, is, that, pre, ignition, is, much, more, likely, to, occur, since, the, fuel, mixture, is, compressed, to, a, higher, temperature, prior, to, deliberate, ignition, the, higher, temperature, more, effectively, evaporates, fuels, such, as, gasoline, which, increases, the, efficiency, of, the, compression, engine, higher, compression, ratios, also, mean, that, the, distance, that, the, piston, can, push, to, produce, power, is, greater, which, is, called, the, expansion, ratio, the, octane, rating, of, a, given, fuel, is, a, measure, of, the, fuel, s, resistance, to, self, ignition, a, fuel, with, a, higher, numerical, octane, rating, allows, for, a, higher, compression, ratio, which, extracts, more, energy, from, the, fuel, and, more, effectively, converts, that, energy, into, useful, work, while, at, the, same, time, preventing, engine, damage, from, pre, ignition, high, octane, fuel, is, also, more, expensive, many, modern, four, stroke, engines, employ, gasoline, direct, injection, or, gdi, in, a, gasoline, direct, injected, engine, the, injector, nozzle, protrudes, into, the, combustion, chamber, the, direct, fuel, injector, injects, gasoline, under, a, very, high, pressure, into, the, cylinder, during, the, compression, stroke, when, the, piston, is, closer, to, the, top, diesel, engines, by, their, nature, do, not, have, concerns, with, pre, ignition, they, have, a, concern, with, whether, or, not, combustion, can, be, started, the, description, of, how, likely, diesel, fuel, is, to, ignite, is, called, the, cetane, rating, because, diesel, fuels, are, of, low, volatility, they, can, be, very, hard, to, start, when, cold, various, techniques, are, used, to, start, a, cold, diesel, engine, the, most, common, being, the, use, of, a, glow, plug, the, maximum, amount, of, power, generated, by, an, engine, is, determined, by, the, maximum, amount, of, air, ingested, the, amount, of, power, generated, by, a, piston, engine, is, related, to, its, size, cylinder, volume, whether, it, is, a, two, stroke, engine, or, four, stroke, design, volumetric, efficiency, losses, air, to, fuel, ratio, the, calorific, value, of, the, fuel, oxygen, content, of, the, air, and, speed, rpm, the, speed, is, ultimately, limited, by, material, strength, and, lubrication, valves, pistons, and, connecting, rods, suffer, severe, acceleration, forces, at, high, engine, speed, physical, breakage, and, piston, ring, flutter, can, occur, resulting, in, power, loss, or, even, engine, destruction, piston, ring, flutter, occurs, when, the, rings, oscillate, vertically, within, the, piston, grooves, they, reside, in, ring, flutter, compromises, the, seal, between, the, ring, and, the, cylinder, wall, which, causes, a, loss, of, cylinder, pressure, and, power, if, an, engine, spins, too, quickly, valve, springs, cannot, act, quickly, enough, to, close, the, valves, this, is, commonly, referred, to, as, valve, float, and, it, can, result, in, piston, to, valve, contact, severely, damaging, the, engine, at, high, speeds, the, lubrication, of, piston, cylinder, wall, interface, tends, to, break, down, this, limits, the, piston, speed, for, industrial, engines, to, about, 10, m, s, the, output, power, of, an, engine, is, dependent, on, the, ability, of, intake, air, fuel, mixture, and, exhaust, matter, to, move, quickly, through, valve, ports, typically, located, in, the, cylinder, head, to, increase, an, engine, s, output, power, irregularities, in, the, intake, and, exhaust, paths, such, as, casting, flaws, can, be, removed, and, with, the, aid, of, an, air, flow, bench, the, radii, of, valve, port, turns, and, valve, seat, configuration, can, be, modified, to, reduce, resistance, this, process, is, called, porting, and, it, can, be, done, by, hand, or, with, a, cnc, machine, an, internal, combustion, engine, is, on, average, capable, of, converting, only, 40, 45, of, supplied, energy, into, mechanical, work, a, large, part, of, the, waste, energy, is, in, the, form, of, heat, that, is, released, to, the, environment, through, coolant, fins, etc, if, somehow, waste, heat, could, be, captured, and, turned, to, mechanical, energy, the, engine, s, performance, and, or, fuel, efficiency, could, be, improved, by, improving, the, overall, efficiency, of, the, cycle, it, has, been, found, that, even, if, 6, of, the, entirely, wasted, heat, is, recovered, it, can, increase, the, engine, efficiency, greatly, many, methods, have, been, devised, in, order, to, extract, waste, heat, out, of, an, engine, exhaust, and, use, it, further, to, extract, some, useful, work, decreasing, the, exhaust, pollutants, at, the, same, time, use, of, the, rankine, cycle, turbocharging, and, thermoelectric, generation, can, be, very, useful, as, a, waste, heat, recovery, system, one, way, to, increase, engine, power, is, to, force, more, air, into, the, cylinder, so, that, more, power, can, be, produced, from, each, power, stroke, this, can, be, done, using, some, type, of, air, compression, device, known, as, a, supercharger, which, can, be, powered, by, the, engine, crankshaft, supercharging, increases, the, power, output, limits, of, an, internal, combustion, engine, relative, to, its, displacement, most, commonly, the, supercharger, is, always, running, but, there, have, been, designs, that, allow, it, to, be, cut, out, or, run, at, varying, speeds, relative, to, engine, speed, mechanically, driven, supercharging, has, the, disadvantage, that, some, of, the, output, power, is, used, to, drive, the, supercharger, while, power, is, wasted, in, the, high, pressure, exhaust, as, the, air, has, been, compressed, twice, and, then, gains, more, potential, volume, in, the, combustion, but, it, is, only, expanded, in, one, stage, a, turbocharger, is, a, supercharger, that, is, driven, by, the, engine, s, exhaust, gases, by, means, of, a, turbine, a, turbocharger, is, incorporated, into, the, exhaust, system, of, a, vehicle, to, make, use, of, the, expelled, exhaust, it, consists, of, a, two, piece, high, speed, turbine, assembly, with, one, side, that, compresses, the, intake, air, and, the, other, side, that, is, powered, by, the, exhaust, gas, outflow, when, idling, and, at, low, to, moderate, speeds, the, turbine, produces, little, power, from, the, small, exhaust, volume, the, turbocharger, has, little, effect, and, the, engine, operates, nearly, in, a, naturally, aspirated, manner, when, much, more, power, output, is, required, the, engine, speed, and, throttle, opening, are, increased, until, the, exhaust, gases, are, sufficient, to, spool, up, the, turbocharger, s, turbine, to, start, compressing, much, more, air, than, normal, into, the, intake, manifold, thus, additional, power, and, speed, is, expelled, through, the, function, of, this, turbine, turbocharging, allows, for, more, efficient, engine, operation, because, it, is, driven, by, exhaust, pressure, that, would, otherwise, be, mostly, wasted, but, there, is, a, design, limitation, known, as, turbo, lag, the, increased, engine, power, is, not, immediately, available, due, to, the, need, to, sharply, increase, engine, rpm, to, build, up, pressure, and, to, spin, up, the, turbo, before, the, turbo, starts, to, do, any, useful, air, compression, the, increased, intake, volume, causes, increased, exhaust, and, spins, the, turbo, faster, and, so, forth, until, steady, high, power, operation, is, reached, another, difficulty, is, that, the, higher, exhaust, pressure, causes, the, exhaust, gas, to, transfer, more, of, its, heat, to, the, mechanical, parts, of, the, engine, the, rod, to, stroke, ratio, is, the, ratio, of, the, length, of, the, connecting, rod, to, the, length, of, the, piston, stroke, a, longer, rod, reduces, sidewise, pressure, of, the, piston, on, the, cylinder, wall, and, the, stress, forces, increasing, engine, life, it, also, increases, the, cost, and, engine, height, and, weight, a, square, engine, is, an, engine, with, a, bore, diameter, equal, to, its, stroke, length, an, engine, where, the, bore, diameter, is, larger, than, its, stroke, length, is, an, oversquare, engine, conversely, an, engine, with, a, bore, diameter, that, is, smaller, than, its, stroke, length, is, an, undersquare, engine, the, valves, are, typically, operated, by, a, camshaft, rotating, at, half, the, speed, of, the, crankshaft, it, has, a, series, of, cams, along, its, length, each, designed, to, open, a, valve, during, the, appropriate, part, of, an, intake, or, exhaust, stroke, a, tappet, between, valve, and, cam, is, a, contact, surface, on, which, the, cam, slides, to, open, the, valve, many, engines, use, one, or, more, camshafts, above, a, row, or, each, row, of, cylinders, as, in, the, illustration, in, which, each, cam, directly, actuates, a, valve, through, a, flat, tappet, in, other, engine, designs, the, camshaft, is, in, the, crankcase, in, which, case, each, cam, usually, contacts, a, push, rod, which, contacts, a, rocker, arm, that, opens, a, valve, or, in, case, of, a, flathead, engine, a, push, rod, is, not, necessary, the, overhead, cam, design, typically, allows, higher, engine, speeds, because, it, provides, the, most, direct, path, between, cam, and, valve, valve, clearance, refers, to, the, small, gap, between, a, valve, lifter, and, a, valve, stem, that, ensures, that, the, valve, completely, closes, on, engines, with, mechanical, valve, adjustment, excessive, clearance, causes, noise, from, the, valve, train, a, too, small, valve, clearance, can, result, in, the, valves, not, closing, properly, this, results, in, a, loss, of, performance, and, possibly, overheating, of, exhaust, valves, typically, the, clearance, must, be, readjusted, each, 20, 000, miles, 32, 000, km, with, a, feeler, gauge, most, modern, production, engines, use, hydraulic, lifters, to, automatically, compensate, for, valve, train, component, wear, dirty, engine, oil, may, cause, lifter, failure, otto, engines, are, about, 30, efficient, in, other, words, 30, of, the, energy, generated, by, combustion, is, converted, into, useful, rotational, energy, at, the, output, shaft, of, the, engine, while, the, remainder, being, lost, due, to, waste, heat, friction, and, engine, accessories, there, are, a, number, of, ways, to, recover, some, of, the, energy, lost, to, waste, heat, the, use, of, a, turbocharger, in, diesel, engines, is, very, effective, by, boosting, incoming, air, pressure, and, in, effect, provides, the, same, increase, in, performance, as, having, more, displacement, the, mack, truck, company, decades, ago, developed, a, turbine, system, that, converted, waste, heat, into, kinetic, energy, that, it, fed, back, into, the, engine, s, transmission, in, 2005, bmw, announced, the, development, of, the, turbosteamer, a, two, stage, heat, recovery, system, similar, to, the, mack, system, that, recovers, 80, of, the, energy, in, the, exhaust, gas, and, raises, the, efficiency, of, an, otto, engine, by, 15, by, contrast, a, six, stroke, engine, may, reduce, fuel, consumption, by, as, much, as, 40, modern, engines, are, often, intentionally, built, to, be, slightly, less, efficient, than, they, could, otherwise, be, this, is, necessary, for, emission, controls, such, as, exhaust, gas, recirculation, and, catalytic, converters, that, reduce, smog, and, other, atmospheric, pollutants, reductions, in, efficiency, may, be, counteracted, with, an, engine, control, unit, using, lean, burn, techniques, in, the, united, states, the, corporate, average, fuel, economy, mandates, that, vehicles, must, achieve, an, average, of, 34, 9, mpg, us, 6, 7, l, 100, km, 41, 9, mpg, imp, compared, to, the, current, standard, of, 25, mpg, us, 9, 4, l, 100, km, 30, 0, mpg, imp, as, automakers, look, to, meet, these, standards, by, 2016, new, ways, of, engineering, the, traditional, internal, combustion, engine, ice, have, to, be, considered, some, potential, solutions, to, increase, fuel, efficiency, to, meet, new, mandates, include, firing, after, the, piston, is, farthest, from, the, crankshaft, known, as, top, dead, centre, and, applying, the, miller, cycle, together, this, redesign, could, significantly, reduce, fuel, consumption, and, no, x, emissions, starting, position, intake, stroke, and, compression, stroke, ignition, of, fuel, power, stroke, and, exhaust, stroke
