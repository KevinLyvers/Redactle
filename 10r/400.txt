the, archimedes, screw, also, known, as, the, archimedean, screw, hydrodynamic, screw, water, screw, or, egyptian, screw, is, one, of, the, earliest, hydraulic, machines, named, after, greek, mathematician, archimedes, who, first, described, it, around, 234, bc, although, the, device, had, been, used, in, ancient, egypt, it, is, a, reversible, hydraulic, machine, and, there, are, several, examples, of, archimedes, screw, installations, where, the, screw, can, operate, at, different, times, as, either, pump, or, generator, depending, on, needs, for, power, and, watercourse, flow, as, a, machine, used, for, lifting, water, from, a, low, lying, body, of, water, into, irrigation, ditches, water, is, lifted, by, turning, a, screw, shaped, surface, inside, a, pipe, in, the, modern, world, archimedes, screw, pumps, are, widely, used, in, wastewater, treatment, plants, and, for, dewatering, low, lying, regions, run, in, reverse, archimedes, screw, turbines, act, as, a, new, form, of, small, hydroelectric, powerplant, that, can, be, applied, even, in, low, head, sites, such, generators, operate, in, a, wide, range, of, flows, 0, 01, m, 3, s, displaystyle, m, 3, s, to, 14, 5, m, 3, s, displaystyle, m, 3, s, and, heads, 0, 1, m, to, 10, m, including, low, heads, and, moderate, flow, rates, that, is, not, ideal, for, traditional, turbines, and, not, occupied, by, high, performance, technologies, the, screw, pump, is, the, oldest, positive, displacement, pump, the, first, records, of, a, water, screw, or, screw, pump, date, back, to, hellenistic, egypt, before, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, egyptian, screw, used, to, lift, water, from, the, nile, was, composed, of, tubes, wound, round, a, cylinder, as, the, entire, unit, rotates, water, is, lifted, within, the, spiral, tube, to, the, higher, elevation, a, later, screw, pump, design, from, egypt, had, a, spiral, groove, cut, on, the, outside, of, a, solid, wooden, cylinder, and, then, the, cylinder, was, covered, by, boards, or, sheets, of, metal, closely, covering, the, surfaces, between, the, grooves, some, researchers, have, proposed, this, device, was, used, to, irrigate, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, a, cuneiform, inscription, of, assyrian, king, sennacherib, 704, 681, bc, has, been, interpreted, by, stephanie, dalley, to, describe, casting, water, screws, in, bronze, some, 350, years, earlier, this, is, consistent, with, greek, historian, strabo, who, describes, the, hanging, gardens, as, irrigated, by, screws, the, screw, pump, was, later, introduced, from, hellenistic, egypt, to, greece, it, was, described, by, archimedes, on, the, occasion, of, his, visit, to, egypt, circa, 234, bc, this, tradition, may, reflect, only, that, the, apparatus, was, unknown, to, the, greeks, before, hellenistic, times, athenaeus, of, naucratis, quotes, a, certain, moschion, in, a, description, on, how, hiero, ii, of, syracuse, commissioned, the, design, of, the, syracusia, a, luxury, ship, which, would, be, a, display, of, naval, power, it, is, said, to, have, been, the, largest, ship, built, in, classical, antiquity, and, was, launched, by, archimedes, who, designed, device, with, a, revolving, screw, shaped, blade, inside, a, cylinder, to, remove, any, potential, water, leaking, through, the, hull, archimedes, screw, was, turned, by, hand, and, could, also, be, used, to, transfer, water, from, a, low, lying, body, of, water, into, irrigation, canals, archimedes, never, claimed, credit, for, its, invention, but, it, was, attributed, to, him, 200, years, later, by, diodorus, who, believed, that, archimedes, invented, the, screw, pump, in, egypt, depictions, of, greek, and, roman, water, screws, show, them, being, powered, by, a, human, treading, on, the, outer, casing, to, turn, the, entire, apparatus, as, one, piece, which, would, require, that, the, casing, be, rigidly, attached, to, the, screw, german, engineer, konrad, kyeser, equipped, the, archimedes, screw, with, a, crank, mechanism, in, his, bellifortis, 1405, this, mechanism, quickly, replaced, the, ancient, practice, of, working, the, pipe, by, treading, the, world, s, first, seagoing, steamship, driven, by, a, screw, propeller, was, the, ss, archimedes, which, was, launched, in, 1839, and, named, in, honor, of, archimedes, and, his, work, on, the, screw, developments, in, maritime, transport, occurred, over, the, next, 180, years, from, the, fawcett, preston, and, company, double, blade, design, and, patents, by, sharrow, marine, to, address, rotary, propulsion, and, flow, control, on, boating, vessels, through, loop, propellers, electricity, generation, through, hydropower, pumps, such, as, the, meriden, project, operated, by, new, england, hydropower, also, uses, archimedes, screw, to, direct, water, into, the, top, rather, than, the, bottom, of, the, screw, which, forces, it, to, rotate, archimedes, screws, are, used, in, sewage, treatment, plants, because, they, cope, well, with, varying, rates, of, flow, and, with, suspended, solids, screw, turbines, asts, are, a, new, form, of, generator, for, small, hydroelectric, powerplants, that, could, be, applied, even, in, low, head, sites, the, low, rotation, speed, of, asts, reduces, negative, impacts, on, aquatic, life, and, fish, this, technology, is, used, primarily, at, fish, hatcheries, to, lift, fish, safely, from, ponds, and, transport, them, to, another, location, an, archimedes, screw, was, used, in, the, successful, 2001, stabilization, of, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, small, amounts, of, subsoil, saturated, by, groundwater, were, removed, from, far, below, the, north, side, of, the, tower, and, the, weight, of, the, tower, itself, corrected, the, lean, other, inventions, using, archimedes, screws, include, the, auger, conveyor, in, a, snow, blower, grain, elevator, concrete, mixer, and, chocolate, fountain, the, archimedes, screw, consists, of, a, screw, a, helical, surface, surrounding, a, central, cylindrical, shaft, inside, a, hollow, pipe, the, screw, is, usually, turned, by, windmill, manual, labor, cattle, or, by, modern, means, such, as, a, motor, as, the, shaft, turns, the, bottom, end, scoops, up, a, volume, of, water, this, water, is, then, pushed, up, the, tube, by, the, rotating, helicoid, until, it, pours, out, from, the, top, of, the, tube, the, contact, surface, between, the, screw, and, the, pipe, does, not, need, to, be, perfectly, watertight, as, long, as, the, amount, of, water, being, scooped, with, each, turn, is, large, compared, to, the, amount, of, water, leaking, out, of, each, section, of, the, screw, per, turn, if, water, from, one, section, leaks, into, the, next, lower, one, it, will, be, transferred, upwards, by, the, next, segment, of, the, screw, in, some, designs, the, screw, is, fused, to, the, casing, and, they, both, rotate, together, instead, of, the, screw, turning, within, a, stationary, casing, the, screw, could, be, sealed, to, the, casing, with, pitch, resin, or, other, adhesive, or, the, screw, and, casing, could, be, cast, together, as, a, single, piece, in, bronze, the, design, of, the, everyday, greek, and, roman, water, screw, in, contrast, to, the, heavy, bronze, device, of, sennacherib, with, its, problematic, drive, chains, has, a, powerful, simplicity, a, double, or, triple, helix, was, built, of, wood, strips, or, occasionally, bronze, sheeting, around, a, heavy, wooden, pole, a, cylinder, was, built, around, the, helices, using, long, narrow, boards, fastened, to, their, periphery, and, waterproofed, with, pitch, studies, show, that, the, volume, of, flow, passes, through, archimedes, screws, is, a, function, of, inlet, depth, diameter, and, rotation, speed, of, the, screw, therefore, the, following, analytical, equation, could, be, used, to, design, archimedes, screws, d, o, 16, q, 2, o, s,

common, standards, that, the, archimedes, screw, designers, use, this, analytical, equation, could, be, simplified, as, d, o, q, 3, 7, displaystyle, d, o, approx, eta, q, 3, 7, the, value, of, could, simply, determinate, using, the, displaystyle, eta, graph, or, displaystyle, theta, graph, by, determination, of, d, o, displaystyle, d, o, other, design, parameters, of, archimedes, screws, can, be, calculated, using, a, step, by, step, analytical, method, a, screw, conveyor, is, a, similar, device, which, transports, bulk, materials, such, as, powders, and, cereal, grains, it, is, contained, within, a, tube, and, turned, by, a, motor, to, deliver, material, from, one, end, of, the, conveyor, to, the, other, and, particularly, suitable, for, transport, of, granular, materials, such, as, plastic, granules, used, in, injection, moulding, it, may, also, be, used, to, transport, liquids, in, industrial, control, applications, the, conveyor, may, be, used, as, a, rotary, feeder, or, variable, rate, feeder, to, deliver, a, measured, rate, or, quantity, of, material, into, a, process, a, variant, of, the, archimedes, screw, can, also, be, found, in, some, injection, moulding, machines, die, casting, machines, and, extrusion, of, plastics, which, employ, a, screw, of, decreasing, pitch, to, compress, and, melt, the, material, it, is, also, used, in, a, rotary, screw, air, compressor, on, a, much, larger, scale, archimedes, s, screws, of, decreasing, pitch, are, used, for, the, compaction, of, waste, material, if, water, is, fed, into, the, top, of, an, archimedes, screw, it, will, force, the, screw, to, rotate, the, rotating, shaft, can, then, be, used, to, drive, an, electric, generator, such, an, installation, has, the, same, benefits, as, using, the, screw, for, pumping, the, ability, to, handle, very, dirty, water, and, widely, varying, rates, of, flow, at, high, efficiency, settle, hydro, and, torrs, hydro, are, two, reverse, screw, micro, hydro, schemes, operating, in, england, the, screw, works, well, as, a, generator, at, low, heads, commonly, found, in, english, rivers, including, the, thames, powering, windsor, castle
