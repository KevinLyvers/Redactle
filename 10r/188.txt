kerosene, or, paraffin, is, a, combustible, hydrocarbon, liquid, which, is, derived, from, petroleum, it, is, widely, used, as, a, fuel, in, aviation, as, well, as, households, its, name, derives, from, k, r, s, meaning, wax, and, was, registered, as, a, trademark, by, nova, scotia, geologist, and, inventor, abraham, gesner, in, 1854, before, evolving, into, a, generic, trademark, it, is, sometimes, spelled, kerosine, in, scientific, and, industrial, usage, kerosene, is, widely, used, to, power, jet, engines, of, aircraft, jet, fuel, as, well, as, some, rocket, engines, in, a, highly, refined, form, called, rp, 1, it, is, also, commonly, used, as, a, cooking, and, lighting, fuel, and, for, fire, toys, such, as, poi, in, parts, of, asia, kerosene, is, sometimes, used, as, fuel, for, small, outboard, motors, or, even, motorcycles, world, total, kerosene, consumption, for, all, purposes, is, equivalent, to, about, 5, 500, 000, barrels, per, day, as, of, july, 2023, the, term, kerosene, is, common, in, much, of, argentina, australia, canada, india, new, zealand, nigeria, and, the, united, states, while, the, term, paraffin, or, a, closely, related, variant, is, used, in, chile, east, africa, south, africa, norway, and, the, united, kingdom, the, term, lamp, oil, or, the, equivalent, in, the, local, languages, is, common, in, the, majority, of, asia, and, the, southeastern, united, states, although, in, appalachia, it, is, also, commonly, referred, to, as, coal, oil, confusingly, the, name, paraffin, is, also, used, to, refer, to, a, number, of, distinct, petroleum, byproducts, other, than, kerosene, for, instance, liquid, paraffin, called, mineral, oil, in, the, us, is, a, more, viscous, and, highly, refined, product, which, is, used, as, a, laxative, paraffin, wax, is, a, waxy, solid, extracted, from, petroleum, to, prevent, confusion, between, kerosene, and, the, much, more, flammable, and, volatile, gasoline, petrol, some, jurisdictions, regulate, markings, or, colourings, for, containers, used, to, store, or, dispense, kerosene, for, example, in, the, united, states, pennsylvania, requires, that, portable, containers, used, at, retail, service, stations, for, kerosene, be, colored, blue, as, opposed, to, red, for, gasoline, or, yellow, for, diesel, the, world, health, organization, considers, kerosene, to, be, a, polluting, fuel, and, recommends, that, governments, and, practitioners, immediately, stop, promoting, its, household, use, kerosene, smoke, contains, high, levels, of, harmful, particulate, matter, and, household, use, of, kerosene, is, associated, with, higher, risks, of, cancer, respiratory, infections, asthma, tuberculosis, cataracts, and, adverse, pregnancy, outcomes, kerosene, is, a, low, viscosity, clear, liquid, formed, from, hydrocarbons, obtained, from, the, fractional, distillation, of, petroleum, between, 150, and, 275, c, 300, and, 525, f, resulting, in, a, mixture, with, a, density, of, 0, 78, 0, 81, g, cm, 3, it, is, miscible, with, petroleum, solvents, but, immiscible, with, water, it, is, composed, of, hydrocarbon, molecules, that, typically, contain, between, 6, 20, carbon, atoms, per, molecule, predominantly, containing, 9, to, 16, carbon, atoms, regardless, of, crude, oil, source, or, processing, history, kerosene, s, major, components, are, branched, and, straight, chain, alkanes, hydrocarbon, chains, and, naphthenes, cycloalkanes, which, normally, account, for, at, least, 70, of, volume, aromatic, hydrocarbons, such, as, alkylbenzenes, single, ring, and, alkylnaphthalenes, double, ring, do, not, normally, exceed, 25, by, volume, of, kerosene, streams, olefins, are, usually, not, present, at, more, than, 5, by, volume, the, heat, of, combustion, of, kerosene, is, similar, to, that, of, diesel, fuel, its, lower, heating, value, is, 43, 1, mj, kg, around, 18, 500, btu, lb, and, its, higher, heating, value, is, 46, 2, mj, kg, 19, 900, btu, lb, the, astm, recognizes, two, grades, of, kerosene, 1, k, less, than, 0, 04, sulfur, by, weight, and, 2, k, 0, 3, sulfur, by, weight, grade, 1, k, kerosene, burns, cleaner, with, fewer, deposits, fewer, toxins, and, less, frequent, maintenance, than, 2, k, and, is, the, preferred, grade, for, indoor, heaters, and, stoves, in, the, united, kingdom, two, grades, of, heating, oil, are, defined, bs, 2869, class, c1, is, the, lightest, grade, used, for, lanterns, camping, stoves, and, wick, heaters, and, mixed, with, petrol, in, some, vintage, combustion, engines, as, a, substitute, for, tractor, vaporizing, oil, bs, 2869, class, c2, is, a, heavier, distillate, which, is, used, as, domestic, heating, oil, premium, kerosene, is, usually, sold, in, 5, or, 20, litre, containers, from, hardware, camping, and, garden, stores, and, is, often, dyed, purple, standard, kerosene, is, usually, dispensed, in, bulk, by, a, tanker, and, is, undyed, national, and, international, standards, define, the, properties, of, several, grades, of, kerosene, used, for, jet, fuel, flash, point, and, freezing, point, properties, are, particularly, interesting, for, operation, and, safety, the, standards, also, define, additives, for, control, of, static, electricity, and, other, purposes, kerosene, is, liquid, around, room, temperature, 25, c, 77, f, the, flash, point, of, kerosene, is, between, 37, c, 99, f, and, 65, c, 149, f, and, its, autoignition, temperature, is, 220, c, 428, f, the, freezing, point, of, kerosene, depends, on, grade, with, commercial, aviation, fuel, standardized, at, 47, c, 53, f, grade, 1, k, kerosene, freezes, around, 40, c, 40, f, 233, k, the, process, of, distilling, crude, oil, petroleum, into, kerosene, as, well, as, other, hydrocarbon, compounds, was, first, written, about, in, the, ninth, century, by, the, persian, scholar, r, zi, or, rhazes, in, his, kitab, al, asrar, book, of, secrets, the, physician, and, chemist, razi, described, two, methods, for, the, production, of, kerosene, termed, naft, abyad, white, naphtha, using, an, apparatus, called, an, alembic, one, method, used, clay, as, an, absorbent, and, later, the, other, method, using, chemicals, like, ammonium, chloride, sal, ammoniac, the, distillation, process, was, repeated, until, most, of, the, volatile, hydrocarbon, fractions, had, been, removed, and, the, final, product, was, perfectly, clear, and, safe, to, burn, kerosene, was, also, produced, during, the, same, period, from, oil, shale, and, bitumen, by, heating, the, rock, to, extract, the, oil, which, was, then, distilled, during, the, chinese, ming, dynasty, the, chinese, made, use, of, kerosene, through, extracting, and, purifying, petroleum, and, then, converted, it, into, lamp, fuel, the, chinese, made, use, of, petroleum, for, lighting, lamps, and, heating, homes, as, early, as, 1500, bc, although, coal, oil, was, well, known, by, industrial, chemists, at, least, as, early, as, the, 1700s, as, a, byproduct, of, making, coal, gas, and, coal, tar, it, burned, with, a, smoky, flame, that, prevented, its, use, for, indoor, illumination, in, cities, much, indoor, illumination, was, provided, by, piped, in, coal, gas, but, outside, the, cities, and, for, spot, lighting, within, the, cities, the, lucrative, market, for, fueling, indoor, lamps, was, supplied, by, whale, oil, specifically, that, from, sperm, whales, which, burned, brighter, and, cleaner, canadian, geologist, abraham, pineo, gesner, claimed, that, in, 1846, he, had, given, a, public, demonstration, in, charlottetown, prince, edward, island, of, a, new, process, he, had, discovered, he, heated, coal, in, a, retort, and, distilled, from, it, a, clear, thin, fluid, that, he, showed, made, an, excellent, lamp, fuel, he, coined, the, name, kerosene, for, his, fuel, a, contraction, of, keroselaion, meaning, wax, oil, the, cost, of, extracting, kerosene, from, coal, was, high, gesner, recalled, from, his, extensive, knowledge, of, new, brunswick, s, geology, a, naturally, occurring, asphaltum, called, albertite, he, was, blocked, from, using, it, by, the, new, brunswick, coal, conglomerate, because, they, had, coal, extraction, rights, for, the, province, and, he, lost, a, court, case, when, their, experts, claimed, albertite, was, a, form, of, coal, in, 1854, gesner, moved, to, newtown, creek, long, island, new, york, there, he, secured, backing, from, a, group, of, businessmen, they, formed, the, north, american, gas, light, company, to, which, he, assigned, his, patents, despite, clear, priority, of, discovery, gesner, did, not, obtain, his, first, kerosene, patent, until, 1854, two, years, after, james, young, s, united, states, patent, gesner, s, method, of, purifying, the, distillation, products, appears, to, have, been, superior, to, young, s, resulting, in, a, cleaner, and, better, smelling, fuel, manufacture, of, kerosene, under, the, gesner, patents, began, in, new, york, in, 1854, and, later, in, boston, being, distilled, from, bituminous, coal, and, oil, shale, gesner, registered, the, word, kerosene, as, a, trademark, in, 1854, and, for, several, years, only, the, north, american, gas, light, company, and, the, downer, company, to, which, gesner, had, granted, the, right, were, allowed, to, call, their, lamp, oil, kerosene, in, the, united, states, in, 1848, scottish, chemist, james, young, experimented, with, oil, discovered, seeping, in, a, coal, mine, as, a, source, of, lubricating, oil, and, illuminating, fuel, when, the, seep, became, exhausted, he, experimented, with, the, dry, distillation, of, coal, especially, the, resinous, boghead, coal, torbanite, he, extracted, a, number, of, useful, liquids, from, it, one, of, which, he, named, paraffine, oil, because, at, low, temperatures, it, congealed, into, a, substance, that, resembled, paraffin, wax, young, took, out, a, patent, on, his, process, and, the, resulting, products, in, 1850, and, built, the, first, truly, commercial, oil, works, in, the, world, at, bathgate, in, 1851, using, oil, extracted, from, locally, mined, torbanite, shale, and, bituminous, coal, in, 1852, he, took, out, a, united, states, patent, for, the, same, invention, these, patents, were, subsequently, upheld, in, both, countries, in, a, series, of, lawsuits, and, other, producers, were, obliged, to, pay, him, royalties, in, 1851, samuel, martin, kier, began, selling, lamp, oil, to, local, miners, under, the, name, carbon, oil, he, distilled, this, from, crude, oil, by, a, process, of, his, own, invention, he, also, invented, a, new, lamp, to, burn, his, product, he, has, been, dubbed, the, grandfather, of, the, american, oil, industry, by, historians, kier, s, salt, wells, began, to, be, fouled, with, petroleum, in, the, 1840s, at, first, kier, simply, dumped, the, oil, into, the, nearby, pennsylvania, main, line, canal, as, useless, waste, but, later, he, began, experimenting, with, several, distillates, of, the, crude, oil, along, with, a, chemist, from, eastern, pennsylvania, ignacy, ukasiewicz, a, polish, pharmacist, residing, in, lviv, and, his, hungarian, partner, jan, zeh, had, been, experimenting, with, different, distillation, techniques, trying, to, improve, on, gesner, s, kerosene, process, but, using, oil, from, a, local, petroleum, seep, many, people, knew, of, his, work, but, paid, little, attention, to, it, on, the, night, of, 31, july, 1853, doctors, at, the, local, hospital, needed, to, perform, an, emergency, operation, virtually, impossible, by, candlelight, they, therefore, sent, a, messenger, for, ukasiewicz, and, his, new, lamps, the, lamp, burned, so, brightly, and, cleanly, that, the, hospital, officials, ordered, several, lamps, plus, a, large, supply, of, fuel, ukasiewicz, realized, the, potential, of, his, work, and, quit, the, pharmacy, to, find, a, business, partner, and, then, traveled, to, vienna, to, register, his, technique, with, the, government, ukasiewicz, moved, to, the, gorlice, region, of, poland, in, 1854, and, sank, several, wells, across, southern, poland, over, the, following, decade, setting, up, a, refinery, near, jas, o, in, 1859, the, petroleum, discovery, by, edwin, drake, drake, well, in, western, pennsylvania, in, 1859, caused, a, great, deal, of, public, excitement, and, investment, drilling, in, new, wells, not, only, in, pennsylvania, but, also, in, canada, where, petroleum, had, been, discovered, at, oil, springs, ontario, in, 1858, and, southern, poland, where, ignacy, ukasiewicz, had, been, distilling, lamp, oil, from, petroleum, seeps, since, 1852, the, increased, supply, of, petroleum, allowed, oil, refiners, to, entirely, side, step, the, oil, from, coal, patents, of, both, young, and, gesner, and, produce, illuminating, oil, from, petroleum, without, paying, royalties, to, anyone, as, a, result, the, illuminating, oil, industry, in, the, united, states, completely, switched, over, to, petroleum, in, the, 1860s, the, petroleum, based, illuminating, oil, was, widely, sold, as, kerosene, and, the, trade, name, soon, lost, its, proprietary, status, and, became, the, lower, case, generic, product, kerosene, because, gesner, s, original, kerosene, had, been, also, known, as, coal, oil, generic, kerosene, from, petroleum, was, commonly, called, coal, oil, in, some, parts, of, the, united, states, well, into, the, 20th, century, in, the, united, kingdom, manufacturing, oil, from, coal, or, oil, shale, continued, into, the, early, 20th, century, although, increasingly, overshadowed, by, petroleum, oils, as, kerosene, production, increased, whaling, declined, the, american, whaling, fleet, which, had, been, steadily, growing, for, 50, years, reached, its, all, time, peak, of, 199, ships, in, 1858, by, 1860, just, two, years, later, the, fleet, had, dropped, to, 167, ships, the, civil, war, cut, into, american, whaling, temporarily, but, only, 105, whaling, ships, returned, to, sea, in, 1866, the, first, full, year, of, peace, and, that, number, dwindled, until, only, 39, american, ships, set, out, to, hunt, whales, in, 1876, kerosene, made, first, from, coal, and, oil, shale, then, from, petroleum, had, largely, taken, over, whaling, s, lucrative, market, in, lamp, oil, electric, lighting, started, displacing, kerosene, as, an, illuminant, in, the, late, 19th, century, especially, in, urban, areas, however, kerosene, remained, the, predominant, commercial, end, use, for, petroleum, refined, in, the, united, states, until, 1909, when, it, was, exceeded, by, motor, fuels, the, rise, of, the, gasoline, powered, automobile, in, the, early, 20th, century, created, a, demand, for, the, lighter, hydrocarbon, fractions, and, refiners, invented, methods, to, increase, their, output, of, gasoline, while, decreasing, their, output, of, kerosene, in, addition, some, of, the, heavier, hydrocarbons, that, previously, went, into, kerosene, were, incorporated, into, diesel, fuel, kerosene, kept, some, market, share, by, being, increasingly, used, in, stoves, and, portable, heaters, a, pilot, project, by, eth, zurich, used, solar, power, to, produce, kerosene, from, carbon, dioxide, and, water, in, july, 2022, the, product, can, be, used, in, existing, aviation, applications, and, can, also, be, blended, with, fossil, derived, kerosene, kerosene, is, produced, by, fractional, distillation, of, crude, oil, in, an, oil, refinery, it, condenses, at, a, temperature, intermediate, between, diesel, fuel, which, is, less, volatile, and, naphtha, and, gasoline, which, are, more, volatile, kerosene, made, up, 8, 5, percent, by, volume, of, petroleum, refinery, output, in, 2021, in, the, united, states, of, which, nearly, all, was, kerosene, type, jet, fuel, 8, 4, percent, the, fuel, also, known, as, heating, oil, in, the, uk, and, ireland, remains, widely, used, in, kerosene, lamps, and, lanterns, in, the, developing, world, although, it, replaced, whale, oil, the, 1873, edition, of, elements, of, chemistry, said, the, vapor, of, this, substance, mixed, with, air, is, as, explosive, as, gunpowder, this, statement, may, have, been, due, to, the, common, practice, of, adulterating, kerosene, with, cheaper, but, more, volatile, hydrocarbon, mixtures, such, as, naphtha, kerosene, was, a, significant, fire, risk, in, 1880, nearly, two, of, every, five, new, york, city, fires, were, caused, by, defective, kerosene, lamps, in, less, developed, countries, kerosene, is, an, important, source, of, energy, for, cooking, and, lighting, it, is, used, as, a, cooking, fuel, in, portable, stoves, for, backpackers, as, a, heating, fuel, it, is, often, used, in, portable, stoves, and, is, sold, in, some, filling, stations, it, is, sometimes, used, as, a, heat, source, during, power, failures, kerosene, is, widely, used, in, japan, and, chile, as, a, home, heating, fuel, for, portable, and, installed, kerosene, heaters, in, chile, and, japan, kerosene, can, be, readily, bought, at, any, filling, station, or, be, delivered, to, homes, in, some, cases, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, kerosene, is, often, used, as, a, heating, fuel, in, areas, not, connected, to, a, gas, pipeline, network, it, is, used, less, for, cooking, with, lpg, being, preferred, because, it, is, easier, to, light, kerosene, is, often, the, fuel, of, choice, for, range, cookers, such, as, rayburn, additives, such, as, rangeklene, can, be, put, into, kerosene, to, ensure, that, it, burns, cleaner, and, produces, less, soot, when, used, in, range, cookers, the, amish, who, generally, abstain, from, the, use, of, electricity, rely, on, kerosene, for, lighting, at, night, more, ubiquitous, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, kerosene, space, heaters, were, often, built, into, kitchen, ranges, and, kept, many, farm, and, fishing, families, warm, and, dry, through, the, winter, at, one, time, citrus, growers, used, a, smudge, pot, fueled, by, kerosene, to, create, a, pall, of, thick, smoke, over, a, grove, in, an, effort, to, prevent, freezing, temperatures, from, damaging, crops, salamanders, are, kerosene, space, heaters, used, on, construction, sites, to, dry, out, building, materials, and, to, warm, workers, before, the, days, of, electrically, lighted, road, barriers, highway, construction, zones, were, marked, at, night, by, kerosene, fired, pot, bellied, torches, most, of, these, uses, of, kerosene, created, thick, black, smoke, because, of, the, low, temperature, of, combustion, a, notable, exception, discovered, in, the, early, 19th, century, is, the, use, of, a, gas, mantle, mounted, above, the, wick, on, a, kerosene, lamp, looking, like, a, delicate, woven, bag, above, the, woven, cotton, wick, the, mantle, is, a, residue, of, mineral, materials, mostly, thorium, dioxide, heated, to, incandescence, by, the, flame, from, the, wick, the, thorium, and, cerium, oxide, combination, produces, both, a, whiter, light, and, a, greater, fraction, of, the, energy, in, the, form, of, visible, light, than, a, black, body, at, the, same, temperature, would, these, types, of, lamps, are, still, in, use, today, in, areas, of, the, world, without, electricity, because, they, give, a, much, better, light, than, a, simple, wick, type, lamp, does, recently, a, multipurpose, lantern, that, doubles, as, a, cook, stove, has, been, introduced, in, india, in, areas, with, no, electricity, in, countries, such, as, nigeria, kerosene, is, the, main, fuel, used, for, cooking, especially, by, the, poor, and, kerosene, stoves, have, replaced, traditional, wood, based, cooking, appliances, as, such, increase, in, the, price, of, kerosene, can, have, a, major, political, and, environmental, consequence, the, indian, government, subsidizes, the, fuel, to, keep, the, price, very, low, to, around, 15, u, s, cents, per, liter, as, of, february, 2007, as, lower, prices, discourage, dismantling, of, forests, for, cooking, fuel, in, nigeria, an, attempt, by, the, government, to, remove, a, fuel, subsidy, that, includes, kerosene, met, with, strong, opposition, kerosene, is, used, as, a, fuel, in, portable, stoves, especially, in, primus, stoves, invented, in, 1892, portable, kerosene, stoves, earn, a, reputation, of, reliable, and, durable, stove, in, everyday, use, and, perform, especially, well, under, adverse, conditions, in, outdoor, activities, and, mountaineering, a, decisive, advantage, of, pressurized, kerosene, stoves, over, gas, cartridge, stoves, is, their, particularly, high, thermal, output, and, their, ability, to, operate, at, very, low, temperature, in, winter, or, at, high, altitude, wick, stoves, like, perfection, s, or, wickless, like, boss, continue, to, be, used, by, the, amish, and, off, grid, living, and, in, natural, disasters, where, there, is, no, power, available, in, the, early, to, mid, 20th, century, kerosene, or, tractor, vaporizing, oil, tvo, was, used, as, a, cheap, fuel, for, tractors, and, hit, n, miss, engines, the, engine, would, start, on, gasoline, then, switch, over, to, kerosene, once, the, engine, warmed, up, on, some, engines, a, heat, valve, on, the, manifold, would, route, the, exhaust, gasses, around, the, intake, pipe, heating, the, kerosene, to, the, point, where, it, was, vaporized, and, could, be, ignited, by, an, electric, spark, in, europe, following, the, second, world, war, automobiles, were, similarly, modified, to, run, on, kerosene, rather, than, gasoline, which, they, would, have, to, import, and, pay, heavy, taxes, on, besides, additional, piping, and, the, switch, between, fuels, the, head, gasket, was, replaced, by, a, much, thicker, one, to, diminish, the, compression, ratio, making, the, engine, less, powerful, and, less, efficient, but, able, to, run, on, kerosene, the, necessary, equipment, was, sold, under, the, trademark, econom, during, the, fuel, crisis, of, the, 1970s, saab, valmet, developed, and, series, produced, the, saab, 99, petro, that, ran, on, kerosene, turpentine, or, gasoline, the, project, codenamed, project, lapponia, was, headed, by, simo, vuorio, and, towards, the, end, of, the, 1970s, a, working, prototype, was, produced, based, on, the, saab, 99, gl, the, car, was, designed, to, run, on, two, fuels, gasoline, was, used, for, cold, starts, and, when, extra, power, was, needed, but, normally, it, ran, on, kerosene, or, turpentine, the, idea, was, that, the, gasoline, could, be, made, from, peat, using, the, fischer, tropsch, process, between, 1980, and, 1984, 3, 756, saab, 99, petros, and, 2, 385, talbot, horizons, a, version, of, the, chrysler, horizon, that, integrated, many, saab, components, were, made, one, reason, to, manufacture, kerosene, fueled, cars, was, that, in, finland, kerosene, was, less, heavily, taxed, than, gasoline, kerosene, is, used, to, fuel, smaller, horsepower, outboard, motors, built, by, yamaha, suzuki, and, tohatsu, primarily, used, on, small, fishing, craft, these, are, dual, fuel, engines, that, start, on, gasoline, and, then, transition, to, kerosene, once, the, engine, reaches, optimum, operating, temperature, multiple, fuel, evinrude, and, mercury, racing, engines, also, burn, kerosene, as, well, as, jet, fuel, today, kerosene, is, mainly, used, in, fuel, for, jet, engines, in, several, grades, one, highly, refined, form, of, the, fuel, is, known, as, rp, 1, and, is, often, burned, with, liquid, oxygen, as, rocket, fuel, these, fuel, grade, kerosenes, meet, specifications, for, smoke, points, and, freeze, points, the, combustion, reaction, can, be, approximated, as, follows, with, the, molecular, formula, c, 12, h, 26, dodecane, in, the, initial, phase, of, liftoff, the, saturn, v, launch, vehicle, was, powered, by, the, reaction, of, liquid, oxygen, with, rp, 1, for, the, five, 6, 4, meganewton, sea, level, thrust, f, 1, rocket, engines, of, the, saturn, v, burning, together, the, reaction, generated, roughly, 1, 62, 10, 11, watts, j, s, 162, gigawatt, or, 217, million, horsepower, kerosene, is, sometimes, used, as, an, additive, in, diesel, fuel, to, prevent, gelling, or, waxing, in, cold, temperatures, ultra, low, sulfur, kerosene, is, a, custom, blended, fuel, used, by, the, new, york, city, transit, authority, to, power, its, bus, fleet, the, transit, agency, started, using, this, fuel, in, 2004, prior, to, the, widespread, adoption, of, ultra, low, sulfur, diesel, which, has, since, become, the, standard, in, 2008, the, suppliers, of, the, custom, fuel, failed, to, tender, for, a, renewal, of, the, transit, agency, s, contract, leading, to, a, negotiated, contract, at, a, significantly, increased, cost, jp, 8, for, jet, propellant, 8, a, kerosene, based, fuel, is, used, by, the, united, states, military, as, a, replacement, in, diesel, fueled, vehicles, and, for, powering, aircraft, jp, 8, is, also, used, by, the, u, s, military, and, its, nato, allies, as, a, fuel, for, heaters, stoves, tanks, and, as, a, replacement, for, diesel, fuel, in, the, engines, of, nearly, all, tactical, ground, vehicles, and, electrical, generators, aliphatic, kerosene, is, a, type, of, kerosene, which, has, a, low, aromatic, hydrocarbon, content, the, aromatic, content, of, crude, oil, varies, greatly, from, oil, field, to, oil, field, however, by, solvent, extraction, it, is, possible, to, separate, aromatic, hydrocarbons, from, aliphatic, alkane, hydrocarbons, a, common, method, is, solvent, extraction, with, methanol, dmso, or, sulfolane, aromatic, kerosene, is, a, grade, of, kerosene, with, a, large, concentration, of, aromatic, hydrocarbons, an, example, of, this, would, be, exon, s, solvesso, 150, kerosene, is, commonly, used, in, metal, extraction, as, the, diluent, for, example, in, copper, extraction, by, lix, 84, it, can, be, used, in, mixer, settlers, kerosene, is, used, as, a, diluent, in, the, purex, extraction, process, but, it, is, increasingly, being, supplanted, by, dodecane, and, other, artificial, hydrocarbons, such, as, tph, hydrogenated, propylene, trimer, traditionally, the, uk, plants, at, sellafield, used, aromatic, kerosene, to, reduce, the, radiolysis, of, tbp, while, the, french, nuclear, industry, tended, to, use, diluents, with, very, little, aromatic, content, the, french, nuclear, reprocessing, plants, typically, use, tph, as, their, diluent, in, recent, times, it, has, been, shown, by, mark, foreman, at, chalmers, that, aliphatic, kerosene, can, be, replaced, in, solvent, extraction, with, hvo100, which, is, a, second, generation, biodiesel, made, by, neste, in, x, ray, crystallography, kerosene, can, be, used, to, store, crystals, when, a, hydrated, crystal, is, left, in, air, dehydration, may, occur, slowly, this, makes, the, color, of, the, crystal, become, dull, kerosene, can, keep, air, away, from, the, crystal, it, can, be, also, used, to, prevent, air, from, re, dissolving, in, a, boiled, liquid, and, to, store, alkali, metals, such, as, potassium, sodium, and, rubidium, with, the, exception, of, lithium, which, is, less, dense, than, kerosene, causing, it, to, float, kerosene, is, often, used, in, the, entertainment, industry, for, fire, performances, such, as, fire, breathing, fire, juggling, or, poi, and, fire, dancing, because, of, its, low, flame, temperature, when, burnt, in, free, air, the, risk, is, lower, should, the, performer, come, in, contact, with, the, flame, kerosene, is, generally, not, recommended, as, fuel, for, indoor, fire, dancing, as, it, produces, an, unpleasant, to, some, odor, which, becomes, poisonous, in, sufficient, concentration, ethanol, was, sometimes, used, instead, but, the, flames, it, produces, look, less, impressive, and, its, lower, flash, point, poses, a, high, risk, as, a, petroleum, product, miscible, with, many, industrial, liquids, kerosene, can, be, used, as, both, a, solvent, able, to, remove, other, petroleum, products, such, as, chain, grease, and, as, a, lubricant, with, less, risk, of, combustion, when, compared, to, using, gasoline, it, can, also, be, used, as, a, cooling, agent, in, metal, production, and, treatment, oxygen, free, conditions, in, the, petroleum, industry, kerosene, is, often, used, as, a, synthetic, hydrocarbon, for, corrosion, experiments, to, simulate, crude, oil, in, field, conditions, kerosene, can, be, used, as, an, adhesive, remover, on, hard, to, remove, mucilage, or, adhesive, left, by, stickers, on, a, glass, surface, such, as, in, show, windows, of, stores, it, can, be, used, to, remove, candle, wax, that, has, dripped, onto, a, glass, surface, it, is, recommended, that, the, excess, wax, be, scraped, off, prior, to, applying, kerosene, via, a, soaked, cloth, or, tissue, paper, it, can, be, used, to, clean, bicycle, and, motorcycle, chains, of, old, lubricant, before, relubrication, it, can, also, be, used, to, thin, oil, based, paint, used, in, fine, art, some, artists, even, use, it, to, clean, their, brushes, however, it, leaves, the, bristles, greasy, to, the, touch, it, has, seen, use, for, water, tank, mosquito, control, in, australia, where, a, temporary, thin, floating, layer, above, the, water, protects, it, until, the, defective, tank, is, repaired, the, world, health, organization, considers, kerosene, to, be, a, polluting, fuel, and, recommends, that, governments, and, practitioners, immediately, stop, promoting, its, household, use, kerosene, smoke, contains, high, levels, of, harmful, particulate, matter, and, household, use, of, kerosene, is, associated, with, higher, risks, of, cancer, respiratory, infections, asthma, tuberculosis, cataract, and, adverse, pregnancy, outcomes, ingestion, of, kerosene, is, harmful, kerosene, is, sometimes, recommended, as, a, folk, remedy, for, killing, head, lice, but, health, agencies, warn, against, this, as, it, can, cause, burns, and, serious, illness, a, kerosene, shampoo, can, even, be, fatal, if, fumes, are, inhaled, people, can, be, exposed, to, kerosene, in, the, workplace, by, breathing, it, in, swallowing, it, skin, contact, and, eye, contact, the, us, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, has, set, a, recommended, exposure, limit, of, 100, mg, m, 3, over, an, 8, hour, workday
