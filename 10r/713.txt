a, jet, aircraft, or, simply, jet, is, an, aircraft, nearly, always, a, fixed, wing, aircraft, propelled, by, one, or, more, jet, engines, whereas, the, engines, in, propeller, powered, aircraft, generally, achieve, their, maximum, efficiency, at, much, lower, speeds, and, altitudes, jet, engines, achieve, maximum, efficiency, at, speeds, close, to, or, even, well, above, the, speed, of, sound, jet, aircraft, generally, cruise, most, efficiently, at, about, mach, 0, 8, 981, km, h, 610, mph, and, at, altitudes, around, 10, 000, 15, 000, m, 33, 000, 49, 000, ft, or, more, the, idea, of, the, jet, engine, was, not, new, but, the, technical, problems, involved, could, not, begin, to, be, solved, until, the, 1930s, frank, whittle, an, english, inventor, and, raf, officer, began, development, of, a, viable, jet, engine, in, 1928, and, hans, von, ohain, in, germany, began, work, independently, in, the, early, 1930s, in, august, 1939, the, turbojet, powered, heinkel, he, 178, the, world, s, first, jet, aircraft, made, its, first, flight, a, wide, range, of, different, types, of, jet, aircraft, exist, both, for, civilian, and, military, purposes, after, the, first, instance, of, powered, flight, a, large, number, of, jet, engine, designs, were, suggested, ren, lorin, morize, harris, proposed, systems, for, creating, a, jet, efflux, after, other, jet, engines, had, been, run, romanian, inventor, henri, coand, claimed, to, have, built, a, jet, powered, aircraft, in, 1910, the, coand, 1910, however, to, support, this, claim, he, had, to, make, substantial, alterations, to, the, drawings, which, he, used, to, support, his, subsequently, debunked, claims, in, fact, the, ducted, fan, engine, backfired, setting, the, aircraft, on, fire, before, any, flights, were, ever, made, and, it, lacked, nearly, all, of, the, features, necessary, for, a, jet, engine, including, a, lack, of, fuel, injection, and, any, concern, about, hot, jet, efflux, being, directed, at, a, highly, flammable, fabric, surface, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, a, number, of, approaches, were, tried, a, variety, of, motorjet, turboprop, pulsejet, and, rocket, powered, aircraft, were, designed, rocket, engine, research, was, being, carried, out, in, germany, and, the, first, aircraft, to, fly, under, rocket, power, was, the, lippisch, ente, in, 1928, the, ente, had, previously, been, flown, as, a, glider, the, next, year, in, 1929, the, opel, rak, 1, became, the, first, purpose, built, rocket, aircraft, to, fly, the, turbojet, was, invented, in, the, 1930s, independently, by, frank, whittle, and, later, hans, von, ohain, the, first, turbojet, aircraft, to, fly, was, the, heinkel, he, 178, on, august, 27, 1939, in, rostock, germany, powered, by, von, ohain, s, design, this, was, largely, a, proof, of, concept, as, the, problem, of, creep, metal, fatigue, caused, by, the, high, temperatures, within, the, engine, had, not, been, solved, and, the, engine, quickly, burned, out, von, ohain, s, design, an, axial, flow, engine, as, opposed, to, whittle, s, centrifugal, flow, engine, was, eventually, adopted, by, most, manufacturers, by, the, 1950s, the, first, flight, of, a, jet, propelled, aircraft, to, come, to, public, attention, was, the, italian, caproni, campini, n, 1, motorjet, prototype, which, flew, on, august, 27, 1940, it, was, the, first, jet, aircraft, recognised, by, the, f, d, ration, a, ronautique, internationale, at, the, time, the, german, he, 178, program, was, still, kept, secret, campini, began, development, of, the, motorjet, in, 1932, it, differed, from, a, true, turbojet, in, that, the, turbine, was, driven, by, a, piston, engine, rather, than, combustion, of, the, turbine, gases, which, was, a, much, more, complex, solution, the, british, experimental, gloster, e, 28, 39, first, flew, on, may, 15, 1941, powered, by, sir, frank, whittle, s, turbojet, the, united, states, bell, xp, 59a, flew, on, october, 1, 1942, using, two, examples, of, a, version, of, the, whittle, engine, built, by, general, electric, the, meteor, was, the, first, production, jet, with, the, first, orders, for, production, examples, being, made, on, 8, august, 1941, the, prototype, first, flying, on, 5, march, 1943, and, the, first, production, aircraft, flying, on, 12, january, 1944, while, the, first, orders, for, production, me, 262, aircraft, were, not, issued, until, 25, may, 1943, and, the, first, production, me, 262, did, not, fly, until, 28, march, 1944, despite, the, me, 262, program, having, started, earlier, than, that, of, the, meteor, as, projekt, 1065, with, initial, plans, drawn, up, by, waldemar, voigt, s, design, team, in, april, 1939, the, messerschmitt, me, 262, was, the, first, operational, jet, fighter, manufactured, by, germany, during, world, war, ii, and, entering, service, on, 19, april, 1944, with, erprobungskommando, 262, at, lechfeld, just, south, of, augsburg, an, me, 262, scored, the, first, combat, victory, for, a, jet, fighter, on, 26, july, 1944, the, day, before, the, british, gloster, meteor, entered, operational, service, the, me, 262, had, first, flown, on, april, 18, 1941, but, mass, production, did, not, start, until, early, 1944, with, the, first, squadrons, operational, that, year, too, late, for, any, effect, on, the, outcome, of, the, world, war, ii, while, only, around, 15, meteors, were, operational, during, ww2, up, to, 1, 400, me, 262, were, produced, with, 300, entering, combat, only, the, rocket, propelled, messerschmitt, me, 163, komet, was, a, faster, operational, aircraft, during, the, war, around, this, time, mid, 1944, the, united, kingdom, s, meteor, was, being, used, for, defence, of, the, uk, against, the, v, 1, flying, bomb, the, v, 1, itself, a, pulsejet, powered, aircraft, and, direct, ancestor, of, the, cruise, missile, and, then, ground, attack, operations, over, europe, in, the, last, months, of, the, war, in, 1944, germany, introduced, the, arado, ar, 234, jet, reconnaissance, and, bomber, aircraft, into, service, though, chiefly, used, in, the, former, role, with, the, heinkel, he, 162, spatz, single, jet, light, fighter, appearing, at, the, end, of, 1944, ussr, tested, its, own, bereznyak, isayev, bi, 1, in, 1942, but, the, project, was, scrapped, by, leader, joseph, stalin, in, 1945, the, imperial, japanese, navy, also, developed, jet, aircraft, in, 1945, including, the, nakajima, j9y, kikka, a, modified, and, slightly, smaller, version, of, the, me, 262, that, had, folding, wings, by, the, end, of, 1945, the, us, had, introduced, their, first, jet, fighter, the, lockheed, p, 80, shooting, star, into, service, and, the, uk, its, second, fighter, design, the, de, havilland, vampire, the, us, introduced, the, north, american, b, 45, tornado, their, first, jet, bomber, into, service, in, 1948, it, was, capable, of, carrying, nuclear, weapons, but, was, used, for, reconnaissance, over, korea, on, november, 8, 1950, during, the, korean, war, united, states, air, force, lt, russell, j, brown, flying, in, an, f, 80, intercepted, two, north, korean, mig, 15s, near, the, yalu, river, and, shot, them, down, in, the, first, jet, to, jet, dogfight, in, history, the, uk, put, the, english, electric, canberra, into, service, in, 1951, as, a, light, bomber, it, was, designed, to, fly, higher, and, faster, than, any, interceptor, boac, operated, the, first, commercial, jet, service, from, london, to, johannesburg, in, 1952, with, the, de, havilland, comet, jetliner, this, highly, innovative, aircraft, travelled, far, faster, and, higher, than, propeller, aircraft, was, much, quieter, smoother, and, had, stylish, blended, wings, containing, hidden, jet, engines, however, due, to, a, design, defect, and, use, of, aluminium, alloys, the, aircraft, suffered, catastrophic, metal, fatigue, which, led, to, several, crashes, which, gave, time, for, the, boeing, 707, to, enter, service, in, 1958, and, thus, to, dominate, the, market, for, civilian, airliners, the, underslung, engines, were, found, to, be, advantageous, in, the, event, of, a, propellant, leak, and, so, the, 707, looked, rather, different, from, the, comet, the, 707, has, a, shape, that, is, effectively, the, same, as, that, of, contemporary, aircraft, with, marked, commonality, still, evident, today, for, example, with, the, 737, fuselage, and, a340, single, deck, swept, wing, four, below, wing, engines, turbofan, aircraft, with, far, greater, fuel, efficiency, began, entering, service, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, and, became, the, most, commonly, used, type, of, jet, the, tu, 144, supersonic, transport, was, the, fastest, commercial, jet, aircraft, at, mach, 2, 35, 2, 503, km, h, 1, 555, mph, it, went, into, service, in, 1975, but, was, withdrawn, from, commercial, service, shortly, afterwards, the, mach, 2, concorde, entered, service, in, 1976, and, flew, for, 27, years, the, fastest, military, jet, aircraft, was, the, sr, 71, blackbird, at, mach, 3, 35, 3, 661, km, h, 2, 275, mph, most, people, use, the, term, jet, aircraft, to, denote, gas, turbine, based, airbreathing, jet, engines, but, rockets, and, scramjets, are, both, also, propelled, by, jet, propulsion, cruise, missiles, are, single, use, unmanned, jet, aircraft, powered, predominantly, by, ramjets, or, turbojets, or, sometimes, turbofans, but, they, will, often, have, a, rocket, propulsion, system, for, initial, propulsion, the, fastest, airbreathing, jet, aircraft, is, the, unmanned, x, 43, scramjet, at, around, mach, 9, 10, the, fastest, manned, rocket, aircraft, is, the, x, 15, at, mach, 6, 85, the, space, shuttle, while, far, faster, than, the, x, 43, or, x, 15, was, not, regarded, as, an, aircraft, during, ascent, as, it, was, carried, ballistically, by, rocket, thrust, rather, than, the, air, during, re, entry, it, was, classed, like, a, glider, as, an, unpowered, aircraft, the, first, flight, was, in, 1981, the, bell, 533, 1964, lockheed, xh, 51, 1965, and, sikorsky, s, 69, 1977, 1981, are, examples, of, compound, helicopter, designs, where, jet, exhaust, added, to, forward, thrust, the, hiller, yh, 32, hornet, and, fairey, ultra, light, helicopter, were, among, the, many, helicopters, where, the, rotors, were, driven, by, tip, jets, jet, powered, wingsuits, exist, powered, by, model, aircraft, jet, engines, but, of, short, duration, and, needing, to, be, launched, at, height, because, of, the, way, they, work, the, typical, exhaust, speed, of, jet, engines, is, transonic, or, faster, therefore, most, jet, aircraft, need, to, fly, at, high, speeds, either, supersonic, or, speeds, just, below, the, speed, of, sound, transonic, so, as, to, achieve, efficient, flight, aerodynamics, is, therefore, an, important, consideration, jet, aircraft, are, usually, designed, using, the, whitcomb, area, rule, which, says, that, the, total, area, of, cross, section, of, the, aircraft, at, any, point, along, the, aircraft, from, the, nose, must, be, approximately, the, same, as, that, of, a, sears, haack, body, a, shape, with, that, property, minimises, the, production, of, shockwaves, which, would, waste, energy, there, are, several, types, of, engine, which, operate, by, expelling, hot, gas, the, different, types, are, used, for, different, purposes, rockets, are, the, oldest, type, and, are, mainly, used, when, extremely, high, speeds, are, needed, or, operation, at, extremely, high, altitudes, where, there, is, insufficient, air, to, operate, a, jet, engine, due, to, the, extreme, typically, hypersonic, exhaust, velocity, and, the, necessity, of, oxidiser, being, carried, on, board, they, consume, propellant, extremely, quickly, making, them, impractical, for, routine, transportation, turbojets, are, the, second, oldest, type, they, have, a, high, usually, supersonic, exhaust, speed, and, low, frontal, cross, section, and, so, are, best, suited, to, high, speed, usually, supersonic, flight, although, once, widely, used, they, are, relatively, inefficient, compared, to, turboprop, and, turbofans, for, subsonic, flight, the, last, major, aircraft, to, use, turbojets, were, concorde, and, tu, 144, supersonic, transports, low, bypass, turbofans, have, a, lower, exhaust, speed, than, turbojets, and, are, mostly, used, for, high, sonic, transonic, and, low, supersonic, speeds, high, bypass, turbofans, are, relatively, efficient, and, are, used, by, subsonic, aircraft, such, as, airliners, jet, aircraft, fly, considerably, differently, than, propeller, aircraft, one, difference, is, that, jet, engines, respond, relatively, slowly, this, complicates, takeoff, and, landing, maneuvers, in, particular, during, takeoff, propeller, aircraft, engines, blow, air, over, their, wings, and, that, gives, more, lift, and, a, shorter, takeoff, these, differences, caught, out, some, early, boac, comet, pilots, in, aircraft, overall, propulsive, efficiency, displaystyle, eta, is, the, efficiency, in, percent, with, which, the, energy, contained, in, a, vehicle, s, propellant, is, converted, into, useful, energy, to, replace, losses, due, to, air, drag, gravity, and, acceleration, it, can, also, be, stated, as, the, proportion, of, the, mechanical, energy, actually, used, to, propel, the, aircraft, it, is, always, less, than, 100, because, of, kinetic, energy, loss, to, the, exhaust, and, less, than, ideal, efficiency, of, the, propulsive, mechanism, whether, a, propeller, a, jet, exhaust, or, a, fan, in, addition, propulsive, efficiency, is, greatly, dependent, on, air, density, and, airspeed, mathematically, it, is, represented, as, c, p, displaystyle, eta, eta, c, eta, p, where, c, displaystyle, eta, c, is, the, cycle, efficiency, and, p, displaystyle, eta, p, is, the, propulsive, efficiency, the, cycle, efficiency, in, percent, is, the, proportion, of, energy, that, can, be, derived, from, the, energy, source, that, is, converted, to, mechanical, energy, by, the, engine, for, jet, aircraft, the, propulsive, efficiency, essentially, energy, efficiency, is, highest, when, the, engine, emits, an, exhaust, jet, at, a, speed, that, is, the, same, as, or, nearly, the, same, as, the, vehicle, velocity, the, exact, formula, for, air, breathing, engines, as, given, in, the, literature, is, where, c, is, the, exhaust, speed, and, v, is, the, speed, of, the, aircraft, for, a, long, range, jet, operating, in, the, stratosphere, the, speed, of, sound, is, constant, hence, flying, at, fixed, angle, of, attack, and, constant, mach, number, causes, the, aircraft, to, climb, without, changing, the, value, of, the, local, speed, of, sound, in, this, case, v, a, m, displaystyle, v, am, where, m, displaystyle, m, is, the, cruise, mach, number, and, a, displaystyle, a, the, local, speed, of, sound, the, range, equation, can, be, shown, to, be, r, a, m, c, t, c, l, c, d, l, n, w, 1, w, 2, displaystyle, r, frac, am, c, t, frac, c, l, c, d, ln, frac, w, 1, w, 2, which, is, known, as, the, breguet, range, equation, after, the, french, aviation, pioneer, louis, charles, breguet
