an, incandescent, light, bulb, incandescent, lamp, or, incandescent, light, globe, is, an, electric, light, with, a, filament, that, is, heated, until, it, glows, the, filament, is, enclosed, in, a, glass, bulb, that, is, either, evacuated, or, filled, with, inert, gas, to, protect, the, filament, from, oxidation, electric, current, is, supplied, to, the, filament, by, terminals, or, wires, embedded, in, the, glass, a, bulb, socket, provides, mechanical, support, and, electrical, connections, incandescent, bulbs, are, manufactured, in, a, wide, range, of, sizes, light, output, and, voltage, ratings, from, 1, 5, volts, to, about, 300, volts, they, require, no, external, regulating, equipment, have, low, manufacturing, costs, and, work, equally, well, on, either, alternating, current, or, direct, current, as, a, result, the, incandescent, bulb, became, widely, used, in, household, and, commercial, lighting, for, portable, lighting, such, as, table, lamps, car, headlamps, and, flashlights, and, for, decorative, and, advertising, lighting, incandescent, bulbs, are, much, less, efficient, than, other, types, of, electric, lighting, less, than, 5, of, the, energy, they, consume, is, converted, into, visible, light, the, rest, is, lost, as, heat, the, luminous, efficacy, of, a, typical, incandescent, bulb, for, 120, v, operation, is, 16, lumens, per, watt, lm, w, compared, with, 60, lm, w, for, a, compact, fluorescent, bulb, or, 100, lm, w, for, typical, white, led, lamps, the, heat, produced, by, filaments, is, used, in, some, applications, such, as, heat, lamps, in, incubators, lava, lamps, edison, effect, bulbs, and, the, easy, bake, oven, toy, quartz, envelope, halogen, infrared, heaters, are, used, for, industrial, processes, such, as, paint, curing, and, space, heating, incandescent, bulbs, typically, have, short, lifetimes, compared, with, other, types, of, lighting, around, 1, 000, hours, for, home, light, bulbs, versus, typically, 10, 000, hours, for, compact, fluorescents, and, 20, 000, 30, 000, hours, for, lighting, leds, most, incandescent, bulbs, can, be, replaced, by, fluorescent, lamps, high, intensity, discharge, lamps, and, light, emitting, diode, lamps, led, some, governments, have, begun, a, phase, out, of, incandescent, light, bulbs, to, reduce, energy, consumption, historians, robert, friedel, and, paul, israel, list, inventors, of, incandescent, lamps, prior, to, joseph, swan, and, thomas, edison, of, general, electric, 91, 93, they, conclude, that, edison, s, version, was, the, first, practical, implementation, able, to, outstrip, the, others, because, of, a, combination, of, four, factors, an, effective, incandescent, material, a, vacuum, higher, than, other, implementations, which, was, achieved, through, the, use, of, a, sprengel, pump, a, high, resistance, that, made, power, distribution, from, a, centralized, source, economically, viable, and, the, development, of, the, associated, components, required, for, a, large, scale, lighting, system, historian, thomas, hughes, has, attributed, edison, s, success, to, his, development, of, an, entire, integrated, system, of, electric, lighting, the, lamp, was, a, small, component, in, his, system, of, electric, lighting, and, no, more, critical, to, its, effective, functioning, than, the, edison, jumbo, generator, the, edison, main, and, feeder, and, the, parallel, distribution, system, other, inventors, with, generators, and, incandescent, lamps, and, with, comparable, ingenuity, and, excellence, have, long, been, forgotten, because, their, creators, did, not, preside, over, their, introduction, in, a, system, of, lighting, in, 1761, ebenezer, kinnersley, demonstrated, heating, a, wire, to, incandescence, however, such, wires, tended, to, melt, or, oxidize, very, rapidly, burn, in, the, presence, of, air, limelight, became, a, popular, form, of, stage, lighting, in, the, early, 19th, century, by, heating, a, piece, of, calcium, oxide, to, incandescence, with, an, oxyhydrogen, torch, in, 1802, humphry, davy, used, what, he, described, as, a, battery, of, immense, size, consisting, of, 2, 000, cells, housed, in, the, basement, of, the, royal, institution, of, great, britain, to, create, an, incandescent, light, by, passing, the, current, through, a, thin, strip, of, platinum, chosen, because, the, metal, had, an, extremely, high, melting, point, it, was, not, bright, enough, nor, did, it, last, long, enough, to, be, practical, but, it, was, the, precedent, behind, the, efforts, of, scores, of, experimenters, over, the, next, 75, years, davy, also, demonstrated, the, electric, arc, by, passing, high, current, between, two, pieces, of, charcoal, for, the, next, 40, years, much, research, was, given, to, turning, the, carbon, arc, lamp, into, a, practical, means, of, lighting, the, carbon, arc, itself, was, dim, and, violet, in, color, emitting, most, of, its, energy, in, the, ultraviolet, but, the, positive, electrode, was, heated, to, just, below, the, melting, point, of, carbon, and, glowed, very, brightly, with, incandescence, very, close, to, that, of, sunlight, arc, lamps, burned, up, their, carbon, rods, very, rapidly, expelled, dangerous, carbon, monoxide, and, tended, to, produce, outputs, in, the, tens, of, kilowatts, therefore, they, were, only, practical, for, lighting, large, areas, so, researchers, continued, to, search, for, a, way, to, make, lamps, suitable, for, home, use, over, the, first, three, quarters, of, the, 19th, century, many, experimenters, worked, with, various, combinations, of, platinum, or, iridium, wires, carbon, rods, and, evacuated, or, semi, evacuated, enclosures, many, of, these, devices, were, demonstrated, and, some, were, patented, in, 1835, james, bowman, lindsay, demonstrated, a, constant, electric, light, at, a, public, meeting, in, dundee, scotland, he, stated, that, he, could, read, a, book, at, a, distance, of, one, and, a, half, feet, however, he, did, not, develop, the, electric, light, any, further, in, 1838, belgian, lithographer, marcellin, jobard, invented, an, incandescent, light, bulb, with, a, vacuum, atmosphere, using, a, carbon, filament, in, 1840, british, scientist, warren, de, la, rue, enclosed, a, coiled, platinum, filament, in, a, vacuum, tube, and, passed, an, electric, current, through, it, the, design, was, based, on, the, concept, that, the, high, melting, point, of, platinum, would, allow, it, to, operate, at, high, temperatures, and, that, the, evacuated, chamber, would, contain, fewer, gas, molecules, to, react, with, the, platinum, improving, its, longevity, although, a, workable, design, the, cost, of, the, platinum, made, it, impractical, for, commercial, use, in, 1841, frederick, de, moleyns, of, england, was, granted, the, first, patent, for, an, incandescent, lamp, with, a, design, using, platinum, wires, contained, within, a, vacuum, bulb, he, also, used, carbon, in, 1845, american, john, w, starr, patented, an, incandescent, light, bulb, using, carbon, filaments, his, invention, was, never, produced, commercially, in, 1851, jean, eug, ne, robert, houdin, publicly, demonstrated, incandescent, light, bulbs, on, his, estate, in, blois, france, his, light, bulbs, are, on, display, in, the, museum, of, the, ch, teau, de, blois, in, 1859, moses, g, farmer, built, an, electric, incandescent, light, bulb, using, a, platinum, filament, thomas, edison, later, saw, one, of, these, bulbs, in, a, shop, in, boston, and, asked, farmer, for, advice, on, the, electric, light, business, in, 1872, russian, alexander, lodygin, invented, an, incandescent, light, bulb, and, obtained, a, russian, patent, in, 1874, he, used, as, a, burner, two, carbon, rods, of, diminished, section, in, a, glass, receiver, hermetically, sealed, and, filled, with, nitrogen, electrically, arranged, so, that, the, current, could, be, passed, to, the, second, carbon, when, the, first, had, been, consumed, later, he, lived, in, the, us, changed, his, name, to, alexander, de, lodyguine, and, applied, for, and, obtained, patents, for, incandescent, lamps, having, chromium, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, molybdenum, and, tungsten, filaments, on, 24, july, 1874, a, canadian, patent, was, filed, by, henry, woodward, and, mathew, evans, for, a, lamp, consisting, of, carbon, rods, mounted, in, a, nitrogen, filled, glass, cylinder, they, were, unsuccessful, at, commercializing, their, lamp, and, sold, rights, to, their, patent, u, s, patent, 181, 613, to, thomas, edison, in, 1879, edison, needed, ownership, of, the, novel, claim, of, lamps, connected, in, a, parallel, circuit, the, government, of, canada, maintains, that, it, is, woodward, and, evans, who, invented, the, lightbulb, on, 4, march, 1880, just, five, months, after, edison, s, light, bulb, alessandro, cruto, created, his, first, incandescent, lamp, cruto, produced, a, filament, by, deposition, of, graphite, on, thin, platinum, filaments, by, heating, it, with, an, electric, current, in, the, presence, of, gaseous, ethyl, alcohol, heating, this, platinum, at, high, temperatures, leaves, behind, thin, filaments, of, platinum, coated, with, pure, graphite, by, september, 1881, he, had, achieved, a, successful, version, of, this, the, first, synthetic, filament, the, light, bulb, invented, by, cruto, lasted, five, hundred, hours, as, opposed, to, the, forty, of, edison, s, original, version, in, 1882, munich, electrical, exhibition, in, bavaria, germany, cruto, s, lamp, was, more, efficient, than, the, edison, s, one, and, produced, a, better, white, light, in, 1893, heinrich, g, bel, claimed, he, had, designed, the, first, incandescent, light, bulb, in, 1854, with, a, thin, carbonized, bamboo, filament, of, high, resistance, platinum, lead, in, wires, in, an, all, glass, envelope, and, a, high, vacuum, judges, of, four, courts, raised, doubts, about, the, alleged, g, bel, anticipation, but, there, was, never, a, decision, in, a, final, hearing, due, to, the, expiration, of, edison, s, patent, a, research, work, published, in, 2007, concluded, that, the, story, of, the, g, bel, lamps, in, the, 1850s, is, fictitious, joseph, swan, 1828, 1914, was, a, british, physicist, and, chemist, in, 1850, he, began, working, with, carbonized, paper, filaments, in, an, evacuated, glass, bulb, by, 1860, he, was, able, to, demonstrate, a, working, device, but, the, lack, of, a, good, vacuum, and, an, adequate, supply, of, electricity, resulted, in, a, short, lifetime, for, the, bulb, and, an, inefficient, source, of, light, by, the, mid, 1870s, better, pumps, had, become, available, and, swan, returned, to, his, experiments, with, the, help, of, charles, stearn, an, expert, on, vacuum, pumps, in, 1878, swan, developed, a, method, of, processing, that, avoided, the, early, bulb, blackening, this, received, a, british, patent, in, 1880, on, 18, december, 1878, a, lamp, using, a, slender, carbon, rod, was, shown, at, a, meeting, of, the, newcastle, chemical, society, and, swan, gave, a, working, demonstration, at, their, meeting, on, 17, january, 1879, it, was, also, shown, to, 700, who, attended, a, meeting, of, the, literary, and, philosophical, society, of, newcastle, upon, tyne, on, 3, february, 1879, these, lamps, used, a, carbon, rod, from, an, arc, lamp, rather, than, a, slender, filament, thus, they, had, low, resistance, and, required, very, large, conductors, to, supply, the, necessary, current, so, they, were, not, commercially, practical, although, they, did, furnish, a, demonstration, of, the, possibilities, of, incandescent, lighting, with, relatively, high, vacuum, a, carbon, conductor, and, platinum, lead, in, wires, this, bulb, lasted, about, 40, hours, swan, then, turned, his, attention, to, producing, a, better, carbon, filament, and, the, means, of, attaching, its, ends, he, devised, a, method, of, treating, cotton, to, produce, parchmentised, thread, in, the, early, 1880s, and, obtained, british, patent, 4933, that, same, year, from, this, year, he, began, installing, light, bulbs, in, homes, and, landmarks, in, england, his, house, underhill, low, fell, gateshead, was, the, first, in, the, world, to, be, lit, by, a, lightbulb, in, the, early, 1880s, he, had, started, his, company, in, 1881, the, savoy, theatre, in, the, city, of, westminster, london, was, lit, by, swan, incandescent, lightbulbs, which, was, the, first, theatre, and, the, first, public, building, in, the, world, to, be, lit, entirely, by, electricity, the, first, street, in, the, world, to, be, lit, by, an, incandescent, lightbulb, was, mosley, street, newcastle, upon, tyne, united, kingdom, it, was, lit, by, joseph, swan, s, incandescent, lamp, on, 3, february, 1879, thomas, edison, began, serious, research, into, developing, a, practical, incandescent, lamp, in, 1878, edison, filed, his, first, patent, application, for, improvement, in, electric, lights, on, 14, october, 1878, after, many, experiments, first, with, carbon, in, the, early, 1880s, and, then, with, platinum, and, other, metals, in, the, end, edison, returned, to, a, carbon, filament, the, first, successful, test, was, on, 22, october, 1879, and, lasted, 13, 5, hours, edison, continued, to, improve, this, design, and, by, 4, november, 1879, filed, for, a, us, patent, for, an, electric, lamp, using, a, carbon, filament, or, strip, coiled, and, connected, to, platina, contact, wires, although, the, patent, described, several, ways, of, creating, the, carbon, filament, including, using, cotton, and, linen, thread, wood, splints, papers, coiled, in, various, ways, edison, and, his, team, later, discovered, that, a, carbonized, bamboo, filament, could, last, more, than, 1200, hours, in, 1880, the, oregon, railroad, and, navigation, company, steamer, columbia, became, the, first, application, for, edison, s, incandescent, electric, lamps, it, was, also, the, first, ship, to, use, a, dynamo, albon, man, a, new, york, lawyer, started, electro, dynamic, light, company, in, 1878, to, exploit, his, patents, and, those, of, william, sawyer, weeks, later, the, united, states, electric, lighting, company, was, organized, this, company, did, not, make, their, first, commercial, installation, of, incandescent, lamps, until, the, fall, of, 1880, at, the, mercantile, safe, deposit, company, in, new, york, city, about, six, months, after, the, edison, incandescent, lamps, had, been, installed, on, the, columbia, hiram, s, maxim, was, the, chief, engineer, at, the, united, states, electric, lighting, company, after, the, great, success, in, the, united, states, the, incandescent, light, bulb, patented, by, edison, also, began, to, gain, widespread, popularity, in, europe, as, well, among, other, places, the, first, edison, light, bulbs, in, the, nordic, countries, were, installed, at, the, weaving, hall, of, the, finlayson, s, textile, factory, in, tampere, finland, in, march, 1882, lewis, latimer, employed, at, the, time, by, edison, developed, an, improved, method, of, heat, treating, carbon, filaments, which, reduced, breakage, and, allowed, them, to, be, molded, into, novel, shapes, such, as, the, characteristic, m, shape, of, maxim, filaments, on, 17, january, 1882, latimer, received, a, patent, for, the, process, of, manufacturing, carbons, an, improved, method, for, the, production, of, light, bulb, filaments, which, was, purchased, by, the, united, states, electric, light, company, latimer, patented, other, improvements, such, as, a, better, way, of, attaching, filaments, to, their, wire, supports, in, britain, the, edison, and, swan, companies, merged, into, the, edison, and, swan, united, electric, company, later, known, as, ediswan, and, ultimately, incorporated, into, thorn, lighting, ltd, edison, was, initially, against, this, combination, but, edison, was, eventually, forced, to, cooperate, and, the, merger, was, made, eventually, edison, acquired, all, of, swan, s, interest, in, the, company, swan, sold, his, us, patent, rights, to, the, brush, electric, company, in, june, 1882, the, united, states, patent, office, gave, a, ruling, 8, october, 1883, that, edison, s, patents, were, based, on, the, prior, art, of, william, sawyer, and, were, invalid, litigation, continued, for, a, number, of, years, eventually, on, 6, october, 1889, a, judge, ruled, that, edison, s, electric, light, improvement, claim, for, a, filament, of, carbon, of, high, resistance, was, valid, the, main, difficulty, with, evacuating, the, lamps, was, moisture, inside, the, bulb, which, split, when, the, lamp, was, lit, with, resulting, oxygen, attacking, the, filament, in, the, 1880s, phosphoric, anhydride, was, used, in, combination, with, expensive, mercury, vacuum, pumps, however, about, 1893, italian, inventor, arturo, malignani, 1865, 1939, who, lacked, these, pumps, discovered, that, phosphorus, vapours, did, the, job, of, chemically, binding, the, remaining, amounts, of, water, and, oxygen, in, 1896, he, patented, a, process, of, introducing, red, phosphorus, as, the, so, called, getter, inside, the, bulb, which, allowed, obtaining, economic, bulbs, lasting, 800, hours, his, patent, was, acquired, by, edison, in, 1898, in, 1897, german, physicist, and, chemist, walther, nernst, developed, the, nernst, lamp, a, form, of, incandescent, lamp, that, used, a, ceramic, globar, and, did, not, require, enclosure, in, a, vacuum, or, inert, gas, twice, as, efficient, as, carbon, filament, lamps, nernst, lamps, were, briefly, popular, until, overtaken, by, lamps, using, metal, filaments, us575002a, patent, on, 01, dec, 1897, to, alexander, lodyguine, lodygin, russia, describes, filament, made, of, rare, metals, amongst, them, was, tungsten, lodygin, invented, a, process, where, rare, metals, such, as, tungsten, can, be, chemically, treated, and, heat, vaporized, onto, an, electrically, heated, thread, like, wire, platinum, carbon, gold, acting, as, a, temporary, base, or, skeletal, form, us, patent, 575, 002, lodygin, later, sold, the, patent, rights, to, ge, in, 1902, siemens, developed, a, tantalum, lamp, filament, that, was, more, efficient, than, even, graphitized, carbon, filaments, since, they, could, operate, at, higher, temperature, since, tantalum, metal, has, a, lower, resistivity, than, carbon, the, tantalum, lamp, filament, was, quite, long, and, required, multiple, internal, supports, the, metal, filament, gradually, shortened, in, use, the, filaments, were, installed, with, large, slack, loops, lamps, used, for, several, hundred, hours, became, quite, fragile, metal, filaments, had, the, property, of, breaking, and, re, welding, though, this, would, usually, decrease, resistance, and, shorten, the, life, of, the, filament, general, electric, bought, the, rights, to, use, tantalum, filaments, and, produced, them, in, the, us, until, 1913, from, 1898, to, around, 1905, osmium, was, also, used, as, a, filament, in, lamps, made, by, carl, auer, von, welsbach, the, metal, was, so, expensive, that, used, lamps, could, be, returned, for, partial, credit, it, could, not, be, made, for, 110, v, or, 220, v, so, several, lamps, were, wired, in, series, for, use, on, standard, voltage, circuits, these, were, primarily, sold, in, europe, on, 13, december, 1904, hungarian, s, ndor, just, and, croatian, franjo, hanaman, were, granted, a, hungarian, patent, no, 34541, for, a, tungsten, filament, lamp, that, lasted, longer, and, gave, brighter, light, than, the, carbon, filament, tungsten, filament, lamps, were, first, marketed, by, the, hungarian, company, tungsram, in, 1904, this, type, is, often, called, tungsram, bulbs, in, many, european, countries, filling, a, bulb, with, an, inert, gas, such, as, argon, or, nitrogen, slows, down, the, evaporation, of, the, tungsten, filament, compared, to, operating, it, in, a, vacuum, this, allows, for, greater, temperatures, and, therefore, greater, efficacy, with, less, reduction, in, filament, life, in, 1906, william, d, coolidge, developed, a, method, of, making, ductile, tungsten, from, sintered, tungsten, which, could, be, made, into, filaments, while, working, for, general, electric, company, by, 1911, general, electric, had, begun, selling, incandescent, light, bulbs, with, ductile, tungsten, wire, in, 1913, irving, langmuir, found, that, filling, a, lamp, with, inert, gas, instead, of, a, vacuum, resulted, in, twice, the, luminous, efficacy, and, reduced, bulb, blackening, in, 1917, burnie, lee, benbow, was, granted, a, patent, for, the, coiled, coil, filament, in, which, a, coiled, filament, is, then, itself, wrapped, into, a, coil, by, use, of, a, mandrel, in, 1921, junichi, miura, created, the, first, double, coil, bulb, using, a, coiled, coil, tungsten, filament, while, working, for, hakunetsusha, a, predecessor, of, toshiba, at, the, time, machinery, to, mass, produce, coiled, coil, filaments, did, not, exist, hakunetsusha, developed, a, method, to, mass, produce, coiled, coil, filaments, by, 1936, between, 1924, and, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, the, phoebus, cartel, attempted, to, fix, prices, and, sales, quotas, for, bulb, manufacturers, outside, of, north, america, in, 1925, marvin, pipkin, an, american, chemist, patented, a, process, for, frosting, the, inside, of, lamp, bulbs, without, weakening, them, in, 1947, he, patented, a, process, for, coating, the, inside, of, lamps, with, silica, in, 1930, hungarian, imre, br, dy, filled, lamps, with, krypton, gas, rather, than, argon, and, designed, a, process, to, obtain, krypton, from, air, production, of, krypton, filled, lamps, based, on, his, invention, started, at, ajka, in, 1937, in, a, factory, co, designed, by, pol, nyi, and, hungarian, born, physicist, egon, orowan, by, 1964, improvements, in, efficiency, and, production, of, incandescent, lamps, had, reduced, the, cost, of, providing, a, given, quantity, of, light, by, a, factor, of, thirty, compared, with, the, cost, at, introduction, of, edison, s, lighting, system, consumption, of, incandescent, light, bulbs, grew, rapidly, in, the, us, in, 1885, an, estimated, 300, 000, general, lighting, service, lamps, were, sold, all, with, carbon, filaments, when, tungsten, filaments, were, introduced, about, 50, million, lamp, sockets, existed, in, the, us, in, 1914, 88, 5, million, lamps, were, used, only, 15, with, carbon, filaments, and, by, 1945, annual, sales, of, lamps, were, 795, million, more, than, 5, lamps, per, person, per, year, less, than, 5, of, the, power, consumed, by, a, typical, incandescent, light, bulb, is, converted, into, visible, light, with, most, of, the, rest, being, emitted, as, invisible, infrared, radiation, light, bulbs, are, rated, by, their, luminous, efficacy, which, is, the, ratio, of, the, amount, of, visible, light, emitted, luminous, flux, to, the, electrical, power, consumed, luminous, efficacy, is, measured, in, lumens, per, watt, lm, w, the, luminous, efficiency, of, a, source, is, defined, as, the, ratio, of, its, luminous, efficacy, to, the, maximum, possible, luminous, efficacy, which, is, 683, lm, w, an, ideal, white, light, source, could, produce, about, 250, lumens, per, watt, corresponding, to, a, luminous, efficiency, of, 37, for, a, given, quantity, of, light, an, incandescent, light, bulb, consumes, more, power, and, emits, more, heat, than, most, other, types, of, electric, light, in, buildings, where, air, conditioning, is, used, incandescent, lamps, heat, output, increases, load, on, the, air, conditioning, system, while, heat, from, lights, will, reduce, the, need, to, run, a, building, s, heating, system, the, latter, can, usually, produce, the, same, amount, of, heat, at, lower, cost, than, incandescent, lights, the, chart, below, lists, the, luminous, efficacy, and, efficiency, for, several, types, of, incandescent, bulb, a, longer, chart, in, luminous, efficacy, compares, a, broader, array, of, light, sources, the, spectrum, of, light, produced, by, an, incandescent, lamp, closely, approximates, that, of, a, black, body, radiator, at, the, same, temperature, the, basis, for, light, sources, used, as, the, standard, for, color, perception, is, a, tungsten, incandescent, lamp, operating, at, a, defined, temperature, light, sources, such, as, fluorescent, lamps, high, intensity, discharge, lamps, and, led, lamps, have, higher, luminous, efficiency, these, devices, produce, light, by, luminescence, their, light, has, bands, of, characteristic, wavelengths, without, the, tail, of, invisible, infrared, emissions, instead, of, the, continuous, spectrum, produced, by, a, thermal, source, by, careful, selection, of, fluorescent, phosphor, coatings, or, filters, which, modify, the, spectral, distribution, the, spectrum, emitted, can, be, tuned, to, mimic, the, appearance, of, incandescent,

required, by, a, building, s, air, conditioning, system, during, the, heating, season, heat, produced, by, the, bulbs, is, not, wasted, although, in, most, cases, it, is, more, cost, effective, to, obtain, heat, from, the, heating, system, regardless, over, the, course, of, a, year, a, more, efficient, lighting, system, saves, energy, in, nearly, all, climates, since, incandescent, light, bulbs, use, more, energy, than, alternatives, such, as, cfls, and, led, lamps, many, governments, have, introduced, measures, to, ban, their, use, by, setting, minimum, efficacy, standards, higher, than, can, be, achieved, by, incandescent, lamps, measures, to, ban, light, bulbs, have, been, implemented, in, the, european, union, the, united, states, russia, brazil, argentina, canada, and, australia, among, others, the, european, commission, has, calculated, that, the, ban, contributes, 5, to, 10, billion, euros, to, the, economy, and, saves, 40, twh, of, electricity, every, year, translating, in,

incandescent, lamps, in, 2007, general, electric, announced, a, high, efficiency, incandescent, hei, lamp, project, which, they, claimed, would, ultimately, be, as, much, as, four, times, more, efficient, than, current, incandescents, although, their, initial, production, goal, was, to, be, approximately, twice, as, efficient, the, hei, program, was, terminated, in, 2008, due, to, slow, progress, us, department, of, energy, research, at, sandia, national, laboratories, initially, indicated, the, potential, for, dramatically, improved, efficiency, from, a, photonic, lattice, filament, however, later, work, indicated, that, initially, promising, results, were, in, error, prompted, by, legislation, in, various, countries, mandating, increased, bulb, efficiency, hybrid, incandescent, bulbs, have, been, introduced, by, philips, the, halogena, energy, saver, incandescents, can, produce, about, 23, lm, w, about, 30, percent, more, efficient, than, traditional, incandescents, by, using, a, reflective, capsule, to, reflect, formerly, wasted, infrared, radiation, back, to, the, filament, from, which, some, is, re, emitted, as, visible, light, this, concept, was, pioneered, by, duro, test, in, 1980, with, a, commercial, product, that, produced, 29, 8, lm, w, more, advanced, reflectors, based, on, interference, filters, or, photonic, crystals, can, theoretically, result, in, higher, efficiency, up, to, a, limit, of, about, 270, lm, w, 40, of, the, maximum, efficacy, possible, laboratory, proof, of, concept, experiments, have, produced, as, much, as, 45, lm, w, approaching, the, efficacy, of, compact, fluorescent, bulbs, incandescent, light, bulbs, consist, of, an, air, tight, glass, enclosure, the, envelope, or, bulb, with, a, filament, of, tungsten, wire, inside, the, bulb, through, which, an, electric, current, is, passed, contact, wires, and, a, base, with, two, or, more, conductors, provide, electrical, connections, to, the, filament, incandescent, light, bulbs, usually, contain, a, stem, or, glass, mount, anchored, to, the, bulb, s, base, that, allows, the, electrical, contacts, to, run, through, the, envelope, without, air, or, gas, leaks, small, wires, embedded, in, the, stem, in, turn, support, the, filament, and, its, lead, wires, an, electric, current, heats, the, filament, to, typically, 2, 000, to, 3, 300, k, 1, 730, to, 3, 030, c, 3, 140, to, 5, 480, f, well, below, tungsten, s, melting, point, of, 3, 695, k, 3, 422, c, 6, 191, f, filament, temperatures, depend, on, the, filament, type, shape, size, and, amount, of, current, drawn, the, heated, filament, emits, light, that, approximates, a, continuous, spectrum, the, useful, part, of, the, emitted, energy, is, visible, light, but, most, energy, is, given, off, as, heat, in, the, near, infrared, wavelengths, most, light, bulbs, have, either, clear, or, coated, glass, coated, glass, bulbs, have, kaolin, clay, blown, in, and, electrostatically, deposited, on, the, interior, of, the, bulb, the, powder, layer, diffuses, the, light, from, the, filament, pigments, may, be, added, to, the, clay, to, adjust, the, color, of, the, light, emitted, kaolin, diffused, bulbs, are, used, extensively, in, interior, lighting, because, of, their, comparatively, gentle, light, other, kinds, of, colored, bulbs, are, also, made, including, the, various, colors, used, for, party, bulbs, christmas, tree, lights, and, other, decorative, lighting, these, are, created, by, coloring, the, glass, with, a, dopant, which, is, often, a, metal, like, cobalt, blue, or, chromium, green, neodymium, containing, glass, is, sometimes, used, to, provide, a, more, natural, appearing, light, the, glass, bulb, of, a, general, service, lamp, can, reach, temperatures, between, 200, and, 260, c, 392, and, 500, f, lamps, intended, for, high, power, operation, or, used, for, heating, purposes, will, have, envelopes, made, of, hard, glass, or, fused, quartz, if, a, light, bulb, envelope, leaks, the, hot, tungsten, filament, reacts, with, air, yielding, an, aerosol, of, brown, tungsten, nitride, brown, tungsten, dioxide, violet, blue, tungsten, pentoxide, and, yellow, tungsten, trioxide, that, then, gets, deposited, on, the, nearby, surfaces, or, the, bulb, interior, most, modern, bulbs, are, filled, with, an, inert, gas, to, reduce, evaporation, of, the, filament, and, prevent, its, oxidation, the, gas, is, at, a, pressure, of, about, 70, kpa, 0, 7, atm, the, gas, reduces, evaporation, of, the, filament, but, the, fill, must, be, chosen, carefully, to, avoid, introducing, significant, heat, losses, for, these, properties, chemical, inertness, and, high, atomic, or, molecular, weight, is, desirable, the, presence, of, gas, molecules, knocks, the, liberated, tungsten, atoms, back, to, the, filament, reducing, its, evaporation, and, allowing, it, to, be, operated, at, higher, temperature, without, reducing, its, life, or, for, operating, at, the, same, temperature, prolongs, the, filament, life, on, the, other, hand, the, presence, of, the, gas, leads, to, heat, loss, from, the, filament, and, therefore, efficiency, loss, due, to, reduced, incandescence, by, heat, conduction, and, heat, convection, early, lamps, used, only, a, vacuum, to, protect, the, filament, from, oxygen, the, vacuum, increases, evaporation, of, the, filament, but, eliminates, two, modes, of, heat, loss, some, small, modern, lamps, use, vacuum, as, well, the, most, commonly, used, fills, are, the, gas, fill, must, be, free, of, traces, of, water, which, greatly, accelerates, bulb, blackening, see, below, the, gas, layer, close, to, the, filament, called, the, langmuir, layer, is, stagnant, with, heat, transfer, occurring, only, by, conduction, only, at, some, distance, does, convection, occur, to, carry, heat, to, the, bulb, s, envelope, the, orientation, of, the, filament, influences, efficiency, gas, flow, parallel, to, the, filament, e, g, a, vertically, oriented, bulb, with, vertical, or, axial, filament, reduces, convective, losses, the, efficiency, of, the, lamp, increases, with, a, larger, filament, diameter, thin, filament, low, power, bulbs, benefit, less, from, a, fill, gas, so, are, often, only, evacuated, early, light, bulbs, with, carbon, filaments, also, used, carbon, monoxide, nitrogen, or, mercury, vapor, however, carbon, filaments, operate, at, lower, temperatures, than, tungsten, ones, so, the, effect, of, the, fill, gas, was, not, significant, as, the, heat, losses, offset, any, benefits, early, bulbs, were, laboriously, assembled, by, hand, after, automatic, machinery, was, developed, the, cost, of, bulbs, fell, until, 1910, when, libbey, s, westlake, machine, went, into, production, bulbs, were, generally, produced, by, a, team, of, three, workers, two, gatherers, and, a, master, gaffer, blowing, the, bulbs, into, wooden, or, cast, iron, molds, coated, with, a, paste, around, 150, bulbs, per, hour, were, produced, by, the, hand, blowing, process, in, the, 1880s, at, corning, glass, works, the, westlake, machine, developed, by, libbey, glass, was, based, on, an, adaptation, of, the, owens, libbey, bottle, blowing, machine, corning, glass, works, soon, began, developing, competing, automated, bulb, blowing, machines, the, first, of, which, to, be, used, in, production, was, the, e, machine, corning, continued, developing, automated, bulb, production, machines, installing, the, ribbon, machine, in, 1926, in, its, wellsboro, pennsylvania, factory, the, ribbon, machine, surpassed, any, previous, attempts, to, automate, bulb, production, and, was, used, to, produce, incandescent, bulbs, into, the, 21st, century, the, inventor, william, woods, along, with, his, colleague, at, corning, glass, works, david, e, gray, had, created, a, machine, that, by, 1939, was, turning, out, 1, 000, bulbs, per, minute, the, ribbon, machine, works, by, passing, a, continuous, ribbon, of, glass, along, a, conveyor, belt, heated, in, a, furnace, and, then, blown, by, precisely, aligned, air, nozzles, through, holes, in, the, conveyor, belt, into, molds, thus, the, glass, bulbs, or, envelopes, are, created, a, typical, machine, of, this, sort, can, produce, anywhere, from, 50, 000, to, 120, 000, bulbs, per, hour, depending, on, the, size, of, the, bulb, by, the, 1970s, 15, ribbon, machines, installed, in, factories, around, the, world, produced, the, entire, supply, of, incandescent, bulbs, the, filament, and, its, supports, are, assembled, on, a, glass, stem, which, is, then, fused, to, the, bulb, the, air, is, pumped, out, of, the, bulb, and, the, evacuation, tube, in, the, stem, press, is, sealed, by, a, flame, the, bulb, is, then, inserted, into, the, lamp, base, and, the, whole, assembly, tested, the, 2016, closing, of, osram, sylvania, s, wellsboro, pennsylvania, plant, meant, that, one, of, the, last, remaining, ribbon, machines, in, the, united, states, was, shut, down, carbon, has, the, highest, melting, point, of, any, element, and, in, carbon, arc, lamps, it, had, been, demonstrated, to, produce, incandescence, fairly, close, to, that, of, sunlight, however, carbon, has, a, tendency, to, sublimate, before, reaching, its, melting, point, depending, on, pressure, which, led, to, rapid, blackening, of, vacuumed, bulbs, the, first, commercially, successful, light, bulb, filaments, were, made, from, carbonized, paper, or, bamboo, carbon, filaments, have, a, negative, temperature, coefficient, of, resistance, as, they, get, hotter, their, electrical, resistance, decreases, this, made, the, lamp, sensitive, to, fluctuations, in, the, power, supply, since, a, small, increase, of, voltage, would, cause, the, filament, to, heat, up, reducing, its, resistance, and, causing, it, to, draw, even, more, power, and, heat, even, further, carbon, filaments, were, flashed, by, heating, in, a, hydrocarbon, vapor, usually, gasoline, to, improve, their, strength, and, uniformity, metallized, or, graphitized, filaments, were, first, heated, to, high, temperature, to, transform, them, into, graphite, which, further, strengthened, and, smoothed, the, filament, these, filaments, have, a, positive, temperature, coefficient, like, a, metallic, conductor, which, stabilized, the, lamps, operating, properties, against, minor, variations, in, supply, voltage, metal, filaments, were, tried, in, 1897, and, started, to, displace, carbon, starting, around, 1904, tungsten, has, the, highest, available, melting, point, but, brittleness, was, a, big, obstacle, by, 1910, a, process, was, developed, by, william, d, coolidge, at, general, electric, for, production, of, a, ductile, form, of, tungsten, the, process, required, pressing, tungsten, powder, into, bars, then, several, steps, of, sintering, swaging, and, then, wire, drawing, it, was, found, that, very, pure, tungsten, formed, filaments, that, sagged, in, use, and, that, a, very, small, doping, treatment, with, potassium, silicon, and, aluminium, oxides, at, the, level, of, a, few, hundred, parts, per, million, so, called, aks, tungsten, greatly, improved, the, life, and, durability, of, the, tungsten, filaments, the, predominant, mechanism, for, failure, in, tungsten, filaments, even, now, is, grain, boundary, sliding, accommodated, by, diffusional, creep, during, operation, the, tungsten, wire, is, stressed, under, the, load, of, its, own, weight, and, because, of, the, diffusion, that, can, occur, at, high, temperatures, grains, begin, to, rotate, and, slide, this, stress, because, of, variations, in, the, filament, causes, the, filament, to, sag, nonuniformly, which, ultimately, introduces, further, torque, on, the, filament, it, is, this, sagging, that, inevitably, results, in, a, rupture, of, the, filament, rendering, the, incandescent, lightbulb, useless, to, improve, the, efficiency, of, the, lamp, the, filament, usually, consists, of, multiple, coils, of, coiled, fine, wire, also, known, as, a, coiled, coil, light, bulbs, using, coiled, coil, filaments, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, double, coil, bulbs, for, a, 60, watt, 120, volt, lamp, the, uncoiled, length, of, the, tungsten, filament, is, usually, 580, millimetres, 22, 8, in, and, the, filament, diameter, is, 0, 046, millimetres, 0, 0018, in, the, advantage, of, the, coiled, coil, is, that, evaporation, of, the, tungsten, filament, is, at, the, rate, of, a, tungsten, cylinder, having, a, diameter, equal, to, that, of, the, coiled, coil, the, coiled, coil, filament, evaporates, more, slowly, than, a, straight, filament, of, the, same, surface, area, and, light, emitting, power, as, a, result, the, filament, can, then, run, hotter, which, results, in, a, more, efficient, light, source, while, lasting, longer, than, a, straight, filament, at, the, same, temperature, manufacturers, designate, different, forms, of, lamp, filament, with, an, alphanumeric, code, electrical, filaments, are, also, used, in, hot, cathodes, of, fluorescent, lamps, and, vacuum, tubes, as, a, source, of, electrons, or, in, vacuum, tubes, to, heat, an, electron, emitting, electrode, when, used, as, a, source, of, electrons, they, may, have, a, special, coating, that, increases, electron, production, during, ordinary, operation, the, tungsten, of, the, filament, evaporates, hotter, more, efficient, filaments, evaporate, faster, because, of, this, the, lifetime, of, a, filament, lamp, is, a, trade, off, between, efficiency, and, longevity, the, trade, off, is, typically, set, to, provide, a, lifetime, of, 1, 000, to, 2, 000, hours, for, lamps, used, for, general, illumination, theatrical, photographic, and, projection, lamps, may, have, a, useful, life, of, only, a, few, hours, trading, life, expectancy, for, high, output, in, a, compact, form, long, life, general, service, lamps, have, lower, efficiency, but, prior, to, the, development, of, compact, fluorescent, and, led, lamps, they, were, useful, in, applications, where, the, bulb, was, difficult, to, change, irving, langmuir, found, that, an, inert, gas, instead, of, vacuum, would, retard, evaporation, general, service, incandescent, light, bulbs, over, about, 25, watts, in, rating, are, now, filled, with, a, mixture, of, mostly, argon, and, some, nitrogen, or, sometimes, krypton, while, inert, gas, reduces, filament, evaporation, it, also, conducts, heat, from, the, filament, thereby, cooling, the, filament, and, reducing, efficiency, at, constant, pressure, and, temperature, the, thermal, conductivity, of, a, gas, depends, upon, the, molecular, weight, of, the, gas, and, the, cross, sectional, area, of, the, gas, molecules, higher, molecular, weight, gases, have, lower, thermal, conductivity, because, both, the, molecular, weight, and, cross, sectional, area, are, higher, xenon, gas, improves, efficiency, because, of, its, high, molecular, weight, but, is, also, more, expensive, so, its, use, is, limited, to, smaller, lamps, filament, notching, is, due, to, uneven, evaporation, of, the, filament, small, variations, in, resistivity, along, the, filament, cause, hot, spots, to, form, at, points, of, higher, resistivity, a, variation, of, diameter, of, only, 1, will, cause, a, 25, reduction, in, service, life, since, filament, resistance, is, highly, temperature, dependent, spots, with, higher, temperature, will, have, higher, resistance, causing, them, to, dissipate, more, energy, making, them, hotter, a, positive, feedback, loop, these, hot, spots, evaporate, faster, than, the, rest, of, the, filament, permanently, increasing, the, resistance, at, that, point, the, process, ends, in, the, familiar, tiny, gap, in, an, otherwise, healthy, looking, filament, lamps, operated, on, direct, current, develop, random, stairstep, irregularities, on, the, filament, surface, which, may, cut, lifespan, in, half, compared, to, ac, operation, different, alloys, of, tungsten, and, rhenium, can, be, used, to, counteract, the, effect, since, a, filament, breaking, in, a, gas, filled, bulb, can, form, an, electric, arc, which, may, spread, between, the, terminals, and, draw, very, heavy, current, intentionally, thin, lead, in, wires, or, more, elaborate, protection, devices, are, therefore, often, used, as, fuses, built, into, the, light, bulb, more, nitrogen, is, used, in, higher, voltage, lamps, to, reduce, the, possibility, of, arcing, in, a, conventional, lamp, the, evaporated, tungsten, eventually, condenses, on, the, inner, surface, of, the, glass, envelope, darkening, it, for, bulbs, that, contain, a, vacuum, the, darkening, is, uniform, across, the, entire, surface, of, the, envelope, when, a, filling, of, inert, gas, is, used, the, evaporated, tungsten, is, carried, in, the, thermal, convection, currents, of, the, gas, and, is, deposited, preferentially, on, the, uppermost, part, of, the, envelope, blackening, just, that, portion, of, the, envelope, an, incandescent, lamp, that, gives, 93, or, less, of, its, initial, light, output, at, 75, of, its, rated, life, is, regarded, as, unsatisfactory, when, tested, according, to, iec, publication, 60064, light, loss, is, due, to, filament, evaporation, and, bulb, blackening, study, of, the, problem, of, bulb, blackening, led, to, the, discovery, of, thermionic, emission, the, invention, of, the, vacuum, tube, and, evaporation, deposition, used, to, make, mirrors, and, other, optical, coatings, a, very, small, amount, of, water, vapor, inside, a, light, bulb, can, significantly, increase, lamp, darkening, water, vapor, dissociates, into, hydrogen, and, oxygen, at, the, hot, filament, the, oxygen, attacks, the, tungsten, metal, and, the, resulting, tungsten, oxide, particles, travel, to, cooler, parts, of, the, lamp, hydrogen, from, water, vapor, reduces, the, oxide, reforming, water, vapor, and, continuing, this, water, cycle, the, equivalent, of, a, drop, of, water, distributed, over, 500, 000, lamps, will, significantly, increase, darkening, small, amounts, of, substances, such, as, zirconium, are, placed, within, the, lamp, as, a, getter, to, react, with, any, oxygen, that, may, bake, out, of, the, lamp, components, during, operation, some, old, high, powered, lamps, used, in, theater, projection, searchlight, and, lighthouse, service, with, heavy, sturdy, filaments, contained, loose, tungsten, powder, within, the, envelope, from, time, to, time, the, operator, would, remove, the, bulb, and, shake, it, allowing, the, tungsten, powder, to, scrub, off, most, of, the, tungsten, that, had, condensed, on, the, interior, of, the, envelope, removing, the, blackening, and, brightening, the, lamp, again, the, halogen, lamp, reduces, uneven, evaporation, of, the, filament, and, eliminates, darkening, of, the, envelope, by, filling, the, lamp, with, a, halogen, gas, at, low, pressure, along, with, an, inert, gas, the, halogen, cycle, increases, the, lifetime, of, the, bulb, and, prevents, its, darkening, by, redepositing, tungsten, from, the, inside, of, the, bulb, back, onto, the, filament, the, halogen, lamp, can, operate, its, filament, at, a, higher, temperature, than, a, standard, gas, filled, lamp, of, similar, power, without, loss, of, operating, life, such, bulbs, are, much, smaller, than, normal, incandescent, bulbs, and, are, widely, used, where, intense, illumination, is, needed, in, a, limited, space, fiber, optic, lamps, for, optical, microscopy, is, one, typical, application, a, variation, of, the, incandescent, lamp, did, not, use, a, hot, wire, filament, but, instead, used, an, arc, struck, on, a, spherical, bead, electrode, to, produce, heat, the, electrode, then, became, incandescent, with, the, arc, contributing, little, to, the, light, produced, such, lamps, were, used, for, projection, or, illumination, for, scientific, instruments, such, as, microscopes, these, arc, lamps, ran, on, relatively, low, voltages, and, incorporated, tungsten, filaments, to, start, ionization, within, the, envelope, they, provided, the, intense, concentrated, light, of, an, arc, lamp, but, were, easier, to, operate, developed, around, 1915, these, lamps, were, displaced, by, mercury, and, xenon, arc, lamps, incandescent, lamps, are, nearly, pure, resistive, loads, with, a, power, factor, of, 1, unlike, discharge, lamps, or, led, lamps, the, power, consumed, is, equal, to, the, apparent, power, in, the, circuit, incandescent, light, bulbs, are, usually, marketed, according, to, the, electrical, power, consumed, this, depends, mainly, on, the, operating, resistance, of, the, filament, for, two, bulbs, of, the, same, voltage, and, type, the, higher, powered, bulb, gives, more, light, the, table, shows, the, approximate, typical, output, in, lumens, of, standard, 120, volt, incandescent, light, bulbs, at, various, powers, light, output, of, similar, 230, v, bulbs, is, slightly, less, the, lower, current, higher, voltage, filament, is, thinner, and, has, to, be, operated, at, a, slightly, lower, temperature, for, the, same, life, expectancy, which, reduces, energy, efficiency, the, lumen, values, for, soft, white, bulbs, will, generally, be, slightly, lower, than, for, clear, bulbs, at, the, same, power, the, resistance, of, the, filament, is, temperature, dependent, the, cold, resistance, of, tungsten, filament, lamps, is, about, 1, 15, the, resistance, when, operating, for, example, a, 100, watt, 120, volt, lamp, has, a, resistance, of, 144, ohms, when, lit, but, the, cold, resistance, is, much, lower, about, 9, 5, ohms, since, incandescent, lamps, are, resistive, loads, simple, phase, control, triac, dimmers, can, be, used, to, control, brightness, electrical, contacts, may, carry, a, t, rating, symbol, indicating, that, they, are, designed, to, control, circuits, with, the, high, inrush, current, characteristic, of, tungsten, lamps, for, a, 100, watt, 120, volt, general, service, lamp, the, current, stabilizes, in, about, 0, 10, seconds, and, the, lamp, reaches, 90, of, its, full, brightness, after, about, 0, 13, seconds, the, filament, in, a, tungsten, light, bulb, is, not, easy, to, break, when, the, bulb, is, cold, but, filaments, are, more, vulnerable, when, they, are, hot, because, the, incandescent, metal, is, less, rigid, an, impact, on, the, outside, of, the, bulb, may, cause, the, filament, to, break, or, experience, a, surge, in, electric, current, that, causes, part, of, it, to, melt, or, vaporize, in, most, modern, incandescent, bulbs, part, of, the, wire, inside, the, bulb, acts, like, a, fuse, if, a, broken, filament, produces, an, electrical, short, inside, the, bulb, the, fusible, section, of, wire, will, melt, and, cut, the, current, off, to, prevent, damage, to, the, supply, lines, a, hot, glass, bulb, may, fracture, on, contact, with, cold, objects, when, the, glass, envelope, breaks, the, bulb, implodes, exposing, the, filament, to, ambient, air, the, air, then, usually, destroys, the, hot, filament, through, oxidation, bulb, shape, and, size, designations, are, given, in, national, standards, some, designations, are, one, or, more, letters, followed, by, one, or, more, numbers, e, g, a55, or, par38, where, the, letters, identify, the, shape, and, the, numbers, some, characteristic, size, national, standards, such, as, ansi, c79, 1, 2002, is, 14897, 2000, and, jis, c, 7710, 1988, cover, a, common, terminology, for, bulb, shapes, large, lamps, may, have, a, screw, base, or, a, bayonet, base, with, one, or, more, contacts, on, the, base, the, shell, may, serve, as, an, electrical, contact, or, only, as, a, mechanical, support, bayonet, base, lamps, are, frequently, used, in, automotive, lamps, to, resist, loosening, by, vibration, some, tubular, lamps, have, an, electrical, contact, at, either, end, miniature, lamps, may, have, a, wedge, base, and, wire, contacts, and, some, automotive, and, special, purpose, lamps, have, screw, terminals, for, connection, to, wires, very, small, lamps, may, have, the, filament, support, wires, extended, through, the, base, of, the, lamp, for, connections, a, bipin, base, is, often, used, for, halogen, or, reflector, lamps, in, the, late, 19th, century, manufacturers, introduced, a, multitude, of, incompatible, lamp, bases, general, electric, s, mazda, standard, base, sizes, were, soon, adopted, across, the, us, lamp, bases, may, be, secured, to, the, bulb, with, a, cement, or, by, mechanical, crimping, to, indentations, molded, into, the, glass, bulb, lamps, intended, for, use, in, optical, systems, have, bases, with, alignment, features, so, that, the, filament, is, positioned, accurately, within, the, optical, system, a, screw, base, lamp, may, have, a, random, orientation, of, the, filament, when, the, lamp, is, installed, in, the, socket, contacts, in, the, lightbulb, socket, allow, the, electric, current, to, pass, through, the, base, to, the, filament, the, socket, provides, electrical, connections, and, mechanical, support, and, allows, changing, the, lamp, when, it, burns, out, incandescent, lamps, are, very, sensitive, to, changes, in, the, supply, voltage, these, characteristics, are, of, great, practical, and, economic, importance, for, a, supply, voltage, v, near, the, rated, voltage, of, the, lamp, a, 5, reduction, in, voltage, will, double, the, life, of, the, bulb, but, reduce, its, light, output, by, about, 16, long, life, bulbs, take, advantage, of, this, trade, off, in, applications, such, as, traffic, signal, lamps, since, electric, energy, they, use, costs, more, than, the, cost, of, the, bulb, general, service, lamps, emphasize, efficiency, over, long, operating, life, the, objective, is, to, minimize, the, cost, of, light, not, the, cost, of, lamps, early, bulbs, had, a, life, of, up, to, 2500, hours, but, in, 1924, the, phoebus, cartel, agreed, to, limit, life, to, 1000, hours, when, this, was, exposed, in, 1953, general, electric, and, other, leading, american, manufacturers, were, banned, from, limiting, the, life, the, relationships, above, are, valid, for, only, a, few, percent, change, of, voltage, around, standard, rated, conditions, but, they, indicate, that, a, lamp, operated, at, low, voltage, could, last, much, longer, than, at, rated, voltage, albeit, with, greatly, reduced, light, output, the, centennial, light, is, a, light, bulb, that, is, accepted, by, the, guinness, book, of, world, records, as, having, been, burning, almost, continuously, at, a, fire, station, in, livermore, california, since, 1901, however, the, bulb, emits, the, equivalent, light, of, a, four, watt, bulb, a, similar, story, can, be, told, of, a, 40, watt, bulb, in, texas, that, has, been, illuminated, since, 21, september, 1908, it, once, resided, in, an, opera, house, where, notable, celebrities, stopped, to, take, in, its, glow, and, was, moved, to, an, area, museum, in, 1977, photoflood, lamps, used, for, photographic, lighting, favor, light, output, over, life, with, some, lasting, only, two, hours, the, upper, temperature, limit, for, the, filament, is, the, melting, point, of, the, metal, tungsten, is, the, metal, with, the, highest, melting, point, 3, 695, k, 3, 422, c, 6, 191, f, a, 50, hour, life, projection, bulb, for, instance, is, designed, to, operate, only, 50, c, 122, f, below, that, melting, point, such, a, lamp, may, achieve, up, to, 22, lumens, per, watt, compared, with, 17, 5, for, a, 750, hour, general, service, lamp, lamps, of, the, same, power, rating, but, designed, for, different, voltages, have, different, luminous, efficacy, for, example, a, 100, watt, 1000, hour, 120, volt, lamp, will, produce, about, 17, 1, lumens, per, watt, a, similar, lamp, designed, for, 230, v, would, produce, only, around, 12, 8, lumens, per, watt, and, one, designed, for, 30, volts, train, lighting, would, produce, as, much, as, 19, 8, lumens, per, watt, lower, voltage, lamps, have, a, thicker, filament, for, the, same, power, rating, they, can, run, hotter, for, the, same, lifetime, before, the, filament, evaporates, the, wires, used, to, support, the, filament, make, it, mechanically, stronger, but, remove, heat, creating, another, tradeoff, between, efficiency, and, long, life, many, general, service, 120, volt, lamps, use, no, additional, support, wires, but, lamps, designed, for, rough, service, or, vibration, service, may, have, as, many, as, five, low, voltage, lamps, have, filaments, made, of, heavier, wire, and, do, not, require, additional, support, wires, very, low, voltages, are, inefficient, since, the, lead, wires, would, conduct, too, much, heat, away, from, the, filament, so, the, practical, lower, limit, for, incandescent, lamps, is, 1, 5, volts, very, long, filaments, for, high, voltages, are, fragile, and, lamp, bases, become, more, difficult, to, insulate, so, lamps, for, illumination, are, not, made, with, rated, voltages, over, 300, volts, some, infrared, heating, elements, are, made, for, higher, voltages, but, these, use, tubular, bulbs, with, widely, separated, terminals
