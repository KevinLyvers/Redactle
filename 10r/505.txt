a, fortification, also, called, a, fort, fortress, fastness, or, stronghold, is, a, military, construction, designed, for, the, defense, of, territories, in, warfare, and, is, used, to, establish, rule, in, a, region, during, peacetime, the, term, is, derived, from, latin, fortis, strong, and, facere, to, make, from, very, early, history, to, modern, times, defensive, walls, have, often, been, necessary, for, cities, to, survive, in, an, ever, changing, world, of, invasion, and, conquest, some, settlements, in, the, indus, valley, civilization, were, the, first, small, cities, to, be, fortified, in, ancient, greece, large, stone, walls, had, been, built, in, mycenaean, greece, such, as, the, ancient, site, of, mycenae, known, for, the, huge, stone, blocks, of, its, cyclopean, walls, a, greek, phrourion, was, a, fortified, collection, of, buildings, used, as, a, military, garrison, and, is, the, equivalent, of, the, roman, castellum, or, fortress, these, constructions, mainly, served, the, purpose, of, a, watch, tower, to, guard, certain, roads, passes, and, borders, though, smaller, than, a, real, fortress, they, acted, as, a, border, guard, rather, than, a, real, strongpoint, to, watch, and, maintain, the, border, the, art, of, setting, out, a, military, camp, or, constructing, a, fortification, traditionally, has, been, called, castrametation, since, the, time, of, the, roman, legions, fortification, is, usually, divided, into, two, branches, permanent, fortification, and, field, fortification, there, is, also, an, intermediate, branch, known, as, semi, permanent, fortification, castles, are, fortifications, which, are, regarded, as, being, distinct, from, the, generic, fort, or, fortress, in, that, they, are, a, residence, of, a, monarch, or, noble, and, command, a, specific, defensive, territory, roman, forts, and, hill, forts, were, the, main, antecedents, of, castles, in, europe, which, emerged, in, the, 9th, century, in, the, carolingian, empire, the, early, middle, ages, saw, the, creation, of, some, towns, built, around, castles, medieval, style, fortifications, were, largely, made, obsolete, by, the, arrival, of, cannons, in, the, 14th, century, fortifications, in, the, age, of, black, powder, evolved, into, much, lower, structures, with, greater, use, of, ditches, and, earth, ramparts, that, would, absorb, and, disperse, the, energy, of, cannon, fire, walls, exposed, to, direct, cannon, fire, were, very, vulnerable, so, the, walls, were, sunk, into, ditches, fronted, by, earth, slopes, to, improve, protection, the, arrival, of, explosive, shells, in, the, 19th, century, led, to, another, stage, in, the, evolution, of, fortification, star, forts, did, not, fare, well, against, the, effects, of, high, explosives, and, the, intricate, arrangements, of, bastions, flanking, batteries, and, the, carefully, constructed, lines, of, fire, for, the, defending, cannon, could, be, rapidly, disrupted, by, explosive, shells, steel, and, concrete, fortifications, were, common, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, advances, in, modern, warfare, since, world, war, i, have, made, large, scale, fortifications, obsolete, in, most, situations, many, united, states, army, installations, are, known, as, forts, although, they, are, not, always, fortified, during, the, pioneering, era, of, north, america, many, outposts, on, the, frontiers, even, non, military, outposts, were, referred, to, generically, as, forts, larger, military, installations, may, be, called, fortresses, smaller, ones, were, once, known, as, fortalices, the, word, fortification, can, refer, to, the, practice, of, improving, an, area, s, defense, with, defensive, works, city, walls, are, fortifications, but, are, not, necessarily, called, fortresses, the, art, of, setting, out, a, military, camp, or, constructing, a, fortification, traditionally, has, been, called, castrametation, since, the, time, of, the, roman, legions, laying, siege, to, a, fortification, and, of, destroying, it, is, commonly, called, siegecraft, or, siege, warfare, and, is, formally, known, as, poliorcetics, in, some, texts, this, latter, term, also, applies, to, the, art, of, building, a, fortification, fortification, is, usually, divided, into, two, branches, permanent, fortification, and, field, fortification, permanent, fortifications, are, erected, at, leisure, with, all, the, resources, that, a, state, can, supply, of, constructive, and, mechanical, skill, and, are, built, of, enduring, materials, field, fortifications, for, example, breastworks, and, often, known, as, fieldworks, or, earthworks, are, extemporized, by, troops, in, the, field, perhaps, assisted, by, such, local, labour, and, tools, as, may, be, procurable, and, with, materials, that, do, not, require, much, preparation, such, as, soil, brushwood, and, light, timber, or, sandbags, see, sangar, an, example, of, field, fortification, was, the, construction, of, fort, necessity, by, george, washington, in, 1754, there, is, also, an, intermediate, branch, known, as, semi, permanent, fortification, this, is, employed, when, in, the, course, of, a, campaign, it, becomes, desirable, to, protect, some, locality, with, the, best, imitation, of, permanent, defences, that, can, be, made, in, a, short, time, ample, resources, and, skilled, civilian, labour, being, available, an, example, of, this, is, the, construction, of, roman, forts, in, england, and, in, other, roman, territories, where, camps, were, set, up, with, the, intention, of, staying, for, some, time, but, not, permanently, castles, are, fortifications, which, are, regarded, as, being, distinct, from, the, generic, fort, or, fortress, in, that, it, describes, a, residence, of, a, monarch, or, noble, and, commands, a, specific, defensive, territory, an, example, of, this, is, the, massive, medieval, castle, of, carcassonne, from, very, early, history, to, modern, times, walls, have, been, a, necessity, for, many, cities, amnya, fort, in, western, siberia, has, been, described, by, archaeologists, as, one, of, the, oldest, known, fortified, settlements, as, well, as, the, northernmost, stone, age, fort, in, bulgaria, near, the, town, of, provadia, a, walled, fortified, settlement, today, called, solnitsata, starting, from, 4700, bc, had, a, diameter, of, about, 300, feet, 91, m, was, home, to, 350, people, living, in, two, storey, houses, and, was, encircled, by, a, fortified, wall, the, huge, walls, around, the, settlement, which, were, built, very, tall, and, with, stone, blocks, which, are, 6, feet, 1, 8, m, high, and, 4, 5, feet, 1, 4, m, thick, make, it, one, of, the, earliest, walled, settlements, in, europe, but, it, is, younger, than, the, walled, town, of, sesklo, in, greece, from, 6800, bc, uruk, in, ancient, sumer, mesopotamia, is, one, of, the, world, s, oldest, known, walled, cities, the, ancient, egyptians, also, built, fortresses, on, the, frontiers, of, the, nile, valley, to, protect, against, invaders, from, neighbouring, territories, as, well, as, circle, shaped, mud, brick, walls, around, their, cities, many, of, the, fortifications, of, the, ancient, world, were, built, with, mud, brick, often, leaving, them, no, more, than, mounds, of, dirt, for, today, s, archaeologists, a, massive, prehistoric, stone, wall, surrounded, the, ancient, temple, of, ness, of, brodgar, 3200, bc, in, scotland, named, the, great, wall, of, brodgar, it, was, 4, metres, 13, ft, thick, and, 4, metres, tall, the, wall, had, some, symbolic, or, ritualistic, function, the, assyrians, deployed, large, labour, forces, to, build, new, palaces, temples, and, defensive, walls, in, bronze, age, malta, some, settlements, also, began, to, be, fortified, the, most, notable, surviving, example, is, bor, in, nadur, where, a, bastion, built, in, around, 1500, bc, was, found, exceptions, were, few, notably, ancient, sparta, and, ancient, rome, did, not, have, walls, for, a, long, time, choosing, to, rely, on, their, militaries, for, defence, instead, initially, these, fortifications, were, simple, constructions, of, wood, and, earth, which, were, later, replaced, by, mixed, constructions, of, stones, piled, on, top, of, each, other, without, mortar, in, ancient, greece, large, stone, walls, had, been, built, in, mycenaean, greece, such, as, the, ancient, site, of, mycenae, famous, for, the, huge, stone, blocks, of, its, cyclopean, walls, in, classical, era, greece, the, city, of, athens, built, two, parallel, stone, walls, called, the, long, walls, that, reached, their, fortified, seaport, at, piraeus, a, few, miles, away, in, central, europe, the, celts, built, large, fortified, settlements, known, as, oppida, whose, walls, seem, partially, influenced, by, those, built, in, the, mediterranean, the, fortifications, were, continuously, being, expanded, and, improved, around, 600, bc, in, heuneburg, germany, forts, were, constructed, with, a, limestone, foundation, supported, by, a, mudbrick, wall, approximately, 4, metres, tall, probably, topped, by, a, roofed, walkway, thus, reaching, a, total, height, of, 6, metres, the, wall, was, clad, with, lime, plaster, regularly, renewed, towers, protruded, outwards, from, it, the, oppidum, of, manching, german, oppidum, von, manching, was, a, large, celtic, proto, urban, or, city, like, settlement, at, modern, day, manching, near, ingolstadt, bavaria, germany, the, settlement, was, founded, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, existed, until, c, 50, 30, bc, it, reached, its, largest, extent, during, the, late, la, t, ne, period, late, 2nd, century, bc, when, it, had, a, size, of, 380, hectares, at, that, time, 5, 000, to, 10, 000, people, lived, within, its, 7, 2, km, long, walls, the, oppidum, of, bibracte, is, another, example, of, a, gaulish, fortified, settlement, the, term, casemate, wall, is, used, in, the, archaeology, of, israel, and, the, wider, near, east, having, the, meaning, of, a, double, wall, protecting, a, city, or, fortress, with, transverse, walls, separating, the, space, between, the, walls, into, chambers, these, could, be, used, as, such, for, storage, or, residential, purposes, or, could, be, filled, with, soil, and, rocks, during, siege, in, order, to, raise, the, resistance, of, the, outer, wall, against, battering, rams, originally, thought, to, have, been, introduced, to, the, region, by, the, hittites, this, has, been, disproved, by, the, discovery, of, examples, predating, their, arrival, the, earliest, being, at, ti, inik, taanach, where, such, a, wall, has, been, dated, to, the, 16th, century, bc, casemate, walls, became, a, common, type, of, fortification, in, the, southern, levant, between, the, middle, bronze, age, mb, and, iron, age, ii, being, more, numerous, during, the, iron, age, and, peaking, in, iron, age, ii, 10th, 6th, century, bc, however, the, construction, of, casemate, walls, had, begun, to, be, replaced, by, sturdier, solid, walls, by, the, 9th, century, bc, probably, due, the, development, of, more, effective, battering, rams, by, the, neo, assyrian, empire, casemate, walls, could, surround, an, entire, settlement, but, most, only, protected, part, of, it, the, three, different, types, included, freestanding, casemate, walls, then, integrated, ones, where, the, inner, wall, was, part, of, the, outer, buildings, of, the, settlement, and, finally, filled, casemate, walls, where, the, rooms, between, the, walls, were, filled, with, soil, right, away, allowing, for, a, quick, but, nevertheless, stable, construction, of, particularly, high, walls, the, romans, fortified, their, cities, with, massive, mortar, bound, stone, walls, the, most, famous, of, these, are, the, largely, extant, aurelian, walls, of, rome, and, the, theodosian, walls, of, constantinople, together, with, partial, remains, elsewhere, these, are, mostly, city, gates, like, the, porta, nigra, in, trier, or, newport, arch, in, lincoln, hadrian, s, wall, was, built, by, the, roman, empire, across, the, width, of, what, is, now, northern, england, following, a, visit, by, roman, emperor, hadrian, ad, 76, 138, in, ad, 122, a, number, of, forts, dating, from, the, later, stone, age, to, the, british, raj, are, found, in, the, mainland, indian, subcontinent, modern, day, india, pakistan, bangladesh, and, nepal, fort, is, the, word, used, in, india, for, all, old, fortifications, numerous, indus, valley, civilization, sites, exhibit, evidence, of, fortifications, by, about, 3500, bc, hundreds, of, small, farming, villages, dotted, the, indus, floodplain, many, of, these, settlements, had, fortifications, and, planned, streets, the, stone, and, mud, brick, houses, of, kot, diji, were, clustered, behind, massive, stone, flood, dykes, and, defensive, walls, for, neighbouring, communities, bickered, constantly, about, the, control, of, prime, agricultural, land, the, fortification, varies, by, site, while, dholavira, has, stone, built, fortification, walls, harrapa, is, fortified, using, baked, bricks, sites, such, as, kalibangan, exhibit, mudbrick, fortifications, with, bastions, and, lothal, has, a, quadrangular, fortified, layout, evidence, also, suggested, of, fortifications, in, mohenjo, daro, even, a, small, town, for, instance, kotada, bhadli, exhibiting, sophisticated, fortification, like, bastions, shows, that, nearly, all, major, and, minor, towns, of, the, indus, valley, civilization, were, fortified, forts, also, appeared, in, urban, cities, of, the, gangetic, valley, during, the, second, urbanisation, period, between, 600, and, 200, bc, and, as, many, as, 15, fortification, sites, have, been, identified, by, archaeologists, throughout, the, gangetic, valley, such, as, kaushambi, mahasthangarh, pataliputra, mathura, ahichchhatra, rajgir, and, lauria, nandangarh, the, earliest, mauryan, period, brick, fortification, occurs, in, one, of, the, stupa, mounds, of, lauria, nandangarh, which, is, 1, 6, km, in, perimeter, and, oval, in, plan, and, encloses, a, habitation, area, mundigak, c, 2500, bc, in, present, day, south, east, afghanistan, has, defensive, walls, and, square, bastions, of, sun, dried, bricks, india, currently, has, over, 180, forts, with, the, state, of, maharashtra, alone, having, over, 70, forts, which, are, also, known, as, durg, many, of, them, built, by, shivaji, founder, of, the, maratha, empire, a, large, majority, of, forts, in, india, are, in, north, india, the, most, notable, forts, are, the, red, fort, at, old, delhi, the, red, fort, at, agra, the, chittor, fort, and, mehrangarh, fort, in, rajasthan, the, ranthambhor, fort, amer, fort, and, jaisalmer, fort, also, in, rajasthan, and, gwalior, fort, in, madhya, pradesh, the, arthashastra, the, indian, treatise, on, military, strategy, describes, six, major, types, of, forts, differentiated, by, their, major, modes, of, defenses, forts, in, sri, lanka, date, back, thousands, of, years, with, many, being, built, by, sri, lankan, kings, these, include, several, walled, cities, with, the, outset, of, colonial, rule, in, the, indian, ocean, sri, lanka, was, occupied, by, several, major, colonial, empires, that, from, time, to, time, became, the, dominant, power, in, the, indian, ocean, the, colonists, built, several, western, style, forts, mostly, in, and, around, the, coast, of, the, island, the, first, to, build, colonial, forts, in, sri, lanka, were, the, portuguese, these, forts, were, captured, and, later, expanded, by, the, dutch, the, british, occupied, these, dutch, forts, during, the, napoleonic, wars, most, of, the, colonial, forts, were, garrisoned, up, until, the, early, 20th, century, the, coastal, forts, had, coastal, artillery, manned, by, the, ceylon, garrison, artillery, during, the, two, world, wars, most, of, these, were, abandoned, by, the, military, but, retained, civil, administrative, officers, while, others, retained, military, garrisons, which, were, more, administrative, than, operational, some, were, reoccupied, by, military, units, with, the, escalation, of, the, sri, lankan, civil, war, jaffna, fort, for, example, came, under, siege, several, times, large, tempered, earth, i, e, rammed, earth, walls, were, built, in, ancient, china, since, the, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, 1050, bc, the, capital, at, ancient, ao, had, enormous, walls, built, in, this, fashion, see, siege, for, more, info, although, stone, walls, were, built, in, china, during, the, warring, states, 481, 221, bc, mass, conversion, to, stone, architecture, did, not, begin, in, earnest, until, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, ad, the, great, wall, of, china, had, been, built, since, the, qin, dynasty, 221, 207, bc, although, its, present, form, was, mostly, an, engineering, feat, and, remodelling, of, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, ad, in, addition, to, the, great, wall, a, number, of, chinese, cities, also, employed, the, use, of, defensive, walls, to, defend, their, cities, notable, chinese, city, walls, include, the, city, walls, of, hangzhou, nanjing, the, old, city, of, shanghai, suzhou, xi, an, and, the, walled, villages, of, hong, kong, the, famous, walls, of, the, forbidden, city, in, beijing, were, established, in, the, early, 15th, century, by, the, yongle, emperor, the, forbidden, city, made, up, the, inner, portion, of, the, beijing, city, fortifications, during, the, spanish, era, several, forts, and, outposts, were, built, throughout, the, archipelago, most, notable, is, intramuros, the, old, walled, city, of, manila, located, along, the, southern, bank, of, the, pasig, river, the, historic, city, was, home, to, centuries, old, churches, schools, convents, government, buildings, and, residences, the, best, collection, of, spanish, colonial, architecture, before, much, of, it, was, destroyed, by, the, bombs, of, world, war, ii, of, all, the, buildings, within, the, 67, acre, city, only, one, building, the, san, agustin, church, survived, the, war, partial, listing, of, spanish, forts, the, ivatan, people, of, the, northern, islands, of, batanes, built, their, so, called, idjang, on, hills, and, elevated, areas, to, protect, themselves, during, times, of, war, these, fortifications, were, likened, to, european, castles, because, of, their, purpose, usually, the, only, entrance, to, the, castles, would, be, via, a, rope, ladder, that, would, only, be, lowered, for, the, villagers, and, could, be, kept, away, when, invaders, arrived, the, igorots, built, forts, made, of, stone, walls, that, averaged, several, meters, in, width, and, about, two, to, three, times, the, width, in, height, around, 2000, bc, the, muslim, filipinos, of, the, south, built, strong, fortresses, called, kota, or, moong, to, protect, their, communities, usually, many, of, the, occupants, of, these, kotas, are, entire, families, rather, than, just, warriors, lords, often, had, their, own, kotas, to, assert, their, right, to, rule, it, served, not, only, as, a, military, installation, but, as, a, palace, for, the, local, lord, it, is, said, that, at, the, height, of, the, maguindanao, sultanate, s, power, they, blanketed, the, areas, around, western, mindanao, with, kotas, and, other, fortifications, to, block, the, spanish, advance, into, the, region, these, kotas, were, usually, made, of, stone, and, bamboo, or, other, light, materials, and, surrounded, by, trench, networks, as, a, result, some, of, these, kotas, were, burned, easily, or, destroyed, with, further, spanish, campaigns, in, the, region, the, sultanate, was, subdued, and, a, majority, of, kotas, dismantled, or, destroyed, kotas, were, not, only, used, by, the, muslims, as, defense, against, spaniards, and, other, foreigners, renegades, and, rebels, also, built, fortifications, in, defiance, of, other, chiefs, in, the, area, during, the, american, occupation, rebels, built, strongholds, and, the, datus, rajahs, or, sultans, often, built, and, reinforced, their, kotas, in, a, desperate, bid, to, maintain, rule, over, their, subjects, and, their, land, many, of, these, forts, were, also, destroyed, by, american, expeditions, as, a, result, very, very, few, kotas, still, stand, to, this, day, notable, kotas, during, muhammad, s, era, in, arabia, many, tribes, made, use, of, fortifications, in, the, battle, of, the, trench, the, largely, outnumbered, defenders, of, medina, mainly, muslims, led, by, islamic, prophet, muhammad, dug, a, trench, which, together, with, medina, s, natural, fortifications, rendered, the, confederate, cavalry, consisting, of, horses, and, camels, useless, locking, the, two, sides, in, a, stalemate, hoping, to, make, several, attacks, at, once, the, confederates, persuaded, the, medina, allied, banu, qurayza, to, attack, the, city, from, the, south, however, muhammad, s, diplomacy, derailed, the, negotiations, and, broke, up, the, confederacy, against, him, the, well, organized, defenders, the, sinking, of, confederate, morale, and, poor, weather, conditions, caused, the, siege, to, end, in, a, fiasco, during, the, siege, of, ta, if, in, january, 630, muhammad, ordered, his, followers, to, attack, enemies, who, fled, from, the, battle, of, hunayn, and, sought, refuge, in, the, fortress, of, taif, the, entire, city, of, kerma, in, nubia, present, day, sudan, was, encompassed, by, fortified, walls, surrounded, by, a, ditch, archaeology, has, revealed, various, bronze, age, bastions, and, foundations, constructed, of, stone, together, with, either, baked, or, unfired, brick, the, walls, of, benin, are, described, as, the, world, s, second, longest, man, made, structure, as, well, as, the, most, extensive, earthwork, in, the, world, by, the, guinness, book, of, records, 1974, the, walls, may, have, been, constructed, between, the, thirteenth, and, mid, fifteenth, century, ce, or, during, the, first, millennium, ce, strong, citadels, were, also, built, other, in, areas, of, africa, yorubaland, for, example, had, several, sites, surrounded, by, the, full, range, of, earthworks, and, ramparts, seen, elsewhere, and, sited, on, ground, this, improved, defensive, potential, such, as, hills, and, ridges, yoruba, fortifications, were, often, protected, with, a, double, wall, of, trenches, and, ramparts, and, in, the, congo, forests, concealed, ditches, and, paths, along, with, the, main, works, often, bristled, with, rows, of, sharpened, stakes, inner, defenses, were, laid, out, to, blunt, an, enemy, penetration, with, a, maze, of, defensive, walls, allowing, for, entrapment, and, crossfire, on, opposing, forces, a, military, tactic, of, the, ashanti, was, to, create, powerful, log, stockades, at, key, points, this, was, employed, in, later, wars, against, the, british, to, block, british, advances, some, of, these, fortifications, were, over, a, hundred, yards, long, with, heavy, parallel, tree, trunks, they, were, impervious, to, destruction, by, artillery, fire, behind, these, stockades, numerous, ashanti, soldiers, were, mobilized, to, check, enemy, movement, while, formidable, in, construction, many, of, these, strongpoints, failed, because, ashanti, guns, gunpowder, and, bullets, were, poor, and, provided, little, sustained, killing, power, in, defense, time, and, time, again, british, troops, overcame, or, bypassed, the, stockades, by, mounting, old, fashioned, bayonet, charges, after, laying, down, some, covering, fire, defensive, works, were, of, importance, in, the, tropical, african, kingdoms, in, the, kingdom, of, kongo, field, fortifications, were, characterized, by, trenches, and, low, earthen, embankments, such, strongpoints, ironically, sometimes, held, up, much, better, against, european, cannon, than, taller, more, imposing, structures, roman, forts, and, hill, forts, were, the, main, antecedents, of, castles, in, europe, which, emerged, in, the, 9th, century, in, the, carolingian, empire, the, early, middle, ages, saw, the, creation, of, some, towns, built, around, castles, these, cities, were, only, rarely, protected, by, simple, stone, walls, and, more, usually, by, a, combination, of, both, walls, and, ditches, from, the, 12th, century, hundreds, of, settlements, of, all, sizes, were, founded, all, across, europe, which, very, often, obtained, the, right, of, fortification, soon, afterward, the, founding, of, urban, centres, was, an, important, means, of, territorial, expansion, and, many, cities, especially, in, eastern, europe, were, founded, precisely, for, this, purpose, during, the, period, of, eastern, colonisation, these, cities, are, easy, to, recognise, due, to, their, regular, layout, and, large, market, spaces, the, fortifications, of, these, settlements, were, continuously, improved, to, reflect, the, current, level, of, military, development, during, the, renaissance, era, the, venetian, republic, raised, great, walls, around, cities, and, the, finest, examples, among, others, are, in, nicosia, cyprus, rocca, di, manerba, del, garda, lombardy, and, palmanova, italy, or, dubrovnik, croatia, which, proved, to, be, futile, against, attacks, but, still, stand, to, this, day, unlike, the, venetians, the, ottomans, used, to, build, smaller, fortifications, but, in, greater, numbers, and, only, rarely, fortified, entire, settlements, such, as, po, itelj, vratnik, and, jajce, in, bosnia, medieval, style, fortifications, were, largely, made, obsolete, by, the, arrival, of, cannons, on, the, 14th, century, battlefield, fortifications, in, the, age, of, black, powder, evolved, into, much, lower, structures, with, greater, use, of, ditches, and, earth, ramparts, that, would, absorb, and, disperse, the, energy, of, cannon, fire, walls, exposed, to, direct, cannon, fire, were, very, vulnerable, so, were, sunk, into, ditches, fronted, by, earth, slopes, this, placed, a, heavy, emphasis, on, the, geometry, of, the, fortification, to, allow, defensive, cannonry, interlocking, fields, of, fire, to, cover, all, approaches, to, the, lower, and, thus, more, vulnerable, walls, the, evolution, of, this, new, style, of, fortification, can, be, seen, in, transitional, forts, such, as, sarzanello, in, north, west, italy, which, was, built, between, 1492, and, 1502, sarzanello, consists, of, both, crenellated, walls, with, towers, typical, of, the, medieval, period, but, also, has, a, ravelin, like, angular, gun, platform, screening, one, of, the, curtain, walls, which, is, protected, from, flanking, fire, from, the, towers, of, the, main, part, of, the, fort, another, example, is, the, fortifications, of, rhodes, which, were, frozen, in, 1522, so, that, rhodes, is, the, only, european, walled, town, that, still, shows, the, transition, between, the, classical, medieval, fortification, and, the, modern, ones, a, manual, about, the, construction, of, fortification, was, published, by, giovanni, battista, zanchi, in, 1554, fortifications, also, extended, in, depth, with, protected, batteries, for, defensive, cannonry, to, allow, them, to, engage, attacking, cannons, to, keep, them, at, a, distance, and, prevent, them, from, bearing, directly, on, the, vulnerable, walls, the, result, was, star, shaped, fortifications, with, tier, upon, tier, of, hornworks, and, bastions, of, which, fort, bourtange, is, an, excellent, example, there, are, also, extensive, fortifications, from, this, era, in, the, nordic, states, and, in, britain, the, fortifications, of, berwick, upon, tweed, and, the, harbour, archipelago, of, suomenlinna, at, helsinki, being, fine, examples, the, arrival, of, explosive, shells, in, the, 19th, century, led, to, yet, another, stage, in, the, evolution, of, fortification, star, forts, did, not, fare, well, against, the, effects, of, high, explosives, and, the, intricate, arrangements, of, bastions, flanking, batteries, and, the, carefully, constructed, lines, of, fire, for, the, defending, cannon, could, be, rapidly, disrupted, by, explosive, shells, worse, the, large, open, ditches, surrounding, forts, of, this, type, were, an, integral, part, of, the, defensive, scheme, as, was, the, covered, way, at, the, edge, of, the, counter, scarp, the, ditch, was, extremely, vulnerable, to, bombardment, with, explosive, shells, in, response, military, engineers, evolved, the, polygonal, style, of, fortification, the, ditch, became, deep, and, vertically, sided, cut, directly, into, the, native, rock, or, soil, laid, out, as, a, series, of, straight, lines, creating, the, central, fortified, area, that, gives, this, style, of, fortification, its, name, wide, enough, to, be, an, impassable, barrier, for, attacking, troops, but, narrow, enough, to, be, a, difficult, target, for, enemy, shellfire, the, ditch, was, swept, by, fire, from, defensive, blockhouses, set, in, the, ditch, as, well, as, firing, positions, cut, into, the, outer, face, of, the, ditch, itself, the, profile, of, the, fort, became, very, low, indeed, surrounded, outside, the, ditch, covered, by, caponiers, by, a, gently, sloping, open, area, so, as, to, eliminate, possible, cover, for, enemy, forces, while, the, fort, itself, provided, a, minimal, target, for, enemy, fire, the, entrypoint, became, a, sunken, gatehouse, in, the, inner, face, of, the, ditch, reached, by, a, curving, ramp, that, gave, access, to, the, gate, via, a, rolling, bridge, that, could, be, withdrawn, into, the, gatehouse, much, of, the, fort, moved, underground, deep, passages, and, tunnel, networks, now, connected, the, blockhouses, and, firing, points, in, the, ditch, to, the, fort, proper, with, magazines, and, machine, rooms, deep, under, the, surface, the, guns, however, were, often, mounted, in, open, emplacements, and, protected, only, by, a, parapet, both, in, order, to, keep, a, lower, profile, and, also, because, experience, with, guns, in, closed, casemates, had, seen, them, put, out, of, action, by, rubble, as, their, own, casemates, were, collapsed, around, them, gone, were, citadels, surrounding, towns, forts, were, to, be, moved, to, the, outside, of, the, cities, some, 12, km, to, keep, the, enemy, at, a, distance, so, their, artillery, could, not, bombard, the, city, center, from, now, on, a, ring, of, forts, were, to, be, built, at, a, spacing, that, would, allow, them, to, effectively, cover, the, intervals, between, them, the, new, forts, abandoned, the, principle, of, the, bastion, which, had, also, been, made, obsolete, by, advances, in, arms, the, outline, was, a, much, simplified, polygon, surrounded, by, a, ditch, these, forts, built, in, masonry, and, shaped, stone, were, designed, to, shelter, their, garrison, against, bombardment, one, organizing, feature, of, the, new, system, involved, the, construction, of, two, defensive, curtains, an, outer, line, of, forts, backed, by, an, inner, ring, or, line, at, critical, points, of, terrain, or, junctions, see, for, example, s, r, de, rivi, res, system, in, france, traditional, fortification, however, continued, to, be, applied, by, european, armies, engaged, in, warfare, in, colonies, established, in, africa, against, lightly, armed, attackers, from, amongst, the, indigenous, population, a, relatively, small, number, of, defenders, in, a, fort, impervious, to, primitive, weaponry, could, hold, out, against, high, odds, the, only, constraint, being, the, supply, of, ammunition, steel, and, concrete, fortifications, were, common, during, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, however, the, advances, in, modern, warfare, since, world, war, i, have, made, large, scale, fortifications, obsolete, in, most, situations, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, some, fortifications, were, built, with, designs, taking, into, consideration, the, new, threat, of, aerial, warfare, such, as, fort, campbell, in, malta, despite, this, only, underground, bunkers, are, still, able, to, provide, some, protection, in, modern, wars, many, historical, fortifications, were, demolished, during, the, modern, age, but, a, considerable, number, survive, as, popular, tourist, destinations, and, prominent, local, landmarks, today, the, downfall, of, permanent, fortifications, had, two, causes, instead, field, fortification, rose, to, dominate, defensive, action, unlike, the, trench, warfare, which, dominated, world, war, i, these, defences, were, more, temporary, in, nature, this, was, an, advantage, because, since, it, was, less, extensive, it, formed, a, less, obvious, target, for, enemy, force, to, be, directed, against, if, sufficient, power, were, massed, against, one, point, to, penetrate, it, the, forces, based, there, could, be, withdrawn, and, the, line, could, be, re, established, relatively, quickly, instead, of, a, supposedly, impenetrable, defensive, line, such, fortifications, emphasized, defence, in, depth, so, that, as, defenders, were, forced, to, pull, back, or, were, overrun, the, lines, of, defenders, behind, them, could, take, over, the, defence, because, the, mobile, offensives, practised, by, both, sides, usually, focused, on, avoiding, the, strongest, points, of, a, defensive, line, these, defences, were, usually, relatively, thin, and, spread, along, the, length, of, a, line, the, defence, was, usually, not, equally, strong, throughout, however, the, strength, of, the, defensive, line, in, an, area, varied, according, to, how, rapidly, an, attacking, force, could, progress, in, the, terrain, that, was, being, defended, both, the, terrain, the, defensive, line, was, built, on, and, the, ground, behind, it, that, an, attacker, might, hope, to, break, out, into, this, was, both, for, reasons, of, the, strategic, value, of, the, ground, and, its, defensive, value, this, was, possible, because, while, offensive, tactics, were, focused, on, mobility, so, were, defensive, tactics, the, dug, in, defences, consisted, primarily, of, infantry, and, antitank, guns, defending, tanks, and, tank, destroyers, would, be, concentrated, in, mobile, brigades, behind, the, defensive, line, if, a, major, offensive, was, launched, against, a, point, in, the, line, mobile, reinforcements, would, be, sent, to, reinforce, that, part, of, the, line, that, was, in, danger, of, failing, thus, the, defensive, line, could, be, relatively, thin, because, the, bulk, of, the, fighting, power, of, the, defenders, was, not, concentrated, in, the, line, itself, but, rather, in, the, mobile, reserves, a, notable, exception, to, this, rule, was, seen, in, the, defensive, lines, at, the, battle, of, kursk, during, world, war, ii, where, german, forces, deliberately, attacked, the, strongest, part, of, the, soviet, defences, seeking, to, crush, them, utterly, the, terrain, that, was, being, defended, was, of, primary, importance, because, open, terrain, that, tanks, could, move, over, quickly, made, possible, rapid, advances, into, the, defenders, rear, areas, that, were, very, dangerous, to, the, defenders, thus, such, terrain, had, to, be, defended, at, all, costs, in, addition, since, in, theory, the, defensive, line, only, had, to, hold, out, long, enough, for, mobile, reserves, to, reinforce, it, terrain, that, did, not, permit, rapid, advance, could, be, held, more, weakly, because, the, enemy, s, advance, into, it, would, be, slower, giving, the, defenders, more, time, to, reinforce, that, point, in, the, line, for, example, the, battle, of, the, hurtgen, forest, in, germany, during, the, closing, stages, of, world, war, ii, is, an, excellent, example, of, how, difficult, terrain, could, be, used, to, the, defenders, advantage, after, world, war, ii, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, capable, of, reaching, much, of, the, way, around, the, world, were, developed, so, speed, became, an, essential, characteristic, of, the, strongest, militaries, and, defenses, missile, silos, were, developed, so, missiles, could, be, fired, from, the, middle, of, a, country, and, hit, cities, and, targets, in, another, country, and, airplanes, and, air, carriers, became, major, defenses, and, offensive, weapons, leading, to, an, expansion, of, the, use, of, airports, and, airstrips, as, fortifications, mobile, defenses, could, be, had, underwater, too, in, the, form, of, nuclear, submarines, capable, of, firing, missiles, some, bunkers, in, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, came, to, be, buried, deep, inside, mountains, and, prominent, rocks, such, as, gibraltar, and, the, cheyenne, mountain, complex, on, the, ground, itself, minefields, have, been, used, as, hidden, defences, in, modern, warfare, often, remaining, long, after, the, wars, that, produced, them, have, ended, demilitarized, zones, along, borders, are, arguably, another, type, of, fortification, although, a, passive, kind, providing, a, buffer, between, potentially, hostile, militaries, military, airfields, offer, a, fixed, target, rich, environment, for, even, relatively, small, enemy, forces, using, hit, and, run, tactics, by, ground, forces, stand, off, attacks, mortars, and, rockets, air, attacks, or, ballistic, missiles, key, targets, aircraft, munitions, fuel, and, vital, technical, personnel, can, be, protected, by, fortifications, aircraft, can, be, protected, by, revetments, hesco, barriers, hardened, aircraft, shelters, and, underground, hangars, which, will, protect, from, many, types, of, attack, larger, aircraft, types, tend, to, be, based, outside, the, operational, theatre, munition, storage, follows, safety, rules, which, use, fortifications, bunkers, and, bunds, to, provide, protection, against, accident, and, chain, reactions, sympathetic, detonations, weapons, for, rearming, aircraft, can, be, stored, in, small, fortified, expense, stores, closer, to, the, aircraft, at, bien, hoa, south, vietnam, on, the, morning, of, 16, may, 1965, as, aircraft, were, being, re, fuelled, and, armed, a, chain, reaction, explosion, destroyed, 13, aircraft, killed, 34, personnel, and, injured, over, 100, this, along, with, damage, and, losses, of, aircraft, to, enemy, attack, by, both, infiltration, and, stand, off, attacks, led, to, the, construction, of, revetments, and, shelters, to, protect, aircraft, throughout, south, vietnam, aircrew, and, ground, personnel, will, need, protection, during, enemy, attacks, and, fortifications, range, from, culvert, section, duck, and, cover, shelters, to, permanent, air, raid, shelters, soft, locations, with, high, personnel, densities, such, as, accommodation, and, messing, facilities, can, have, limited, protection, by, placing, prefabricated, concrete, walls, or, barriers, around, them, examples, of, barriers, are, jersey, barriers, t, barriers, or, splinter, protection, units, spus, older, fortification, may, prove, useful, such, as, the, old, yugo, pyramid, shelters, built, in, the, 1980s, which, were, used, by, us, personnel, on, 8, jan, 2020, when, iran, fired, 11, ballistic, missiles, at, ayn, al, asad, airbase, in, iraq, fuel, is, volatile, and, has, to, comply, with, rules, for, storage, which, provide, protection, against, accidents, fuel, in, underground, bulk, fuel, installations, is, well, protected, though, valves, and, controls, are, vulnerable, to, enemy, action, above, ground, tanks, can, be, susceptible, to, attack, ground, support, equipment, will, need, to, be, protected, by, fortifications, to, be, usable, after, an, enemy, attack, permanent, concrete, guard, fortifications, are, safer, stronger, last, longer, and, are, more, cost, effective, than, sandbag, fortifications, prefabricated, positions, can, be, made, from, concrete, culvert, sections, the, british, yarnold, bunker, is, made, from, sections, of, a, concrete, pipe, guard, towers, provide, an, increased, field, of, view, but, a, lower, level, of, protection, dispersal, and, camouflage, of, assets, can, supplement, fortifications, against, some, forms, of, airfield, attack, just, as, in, colonial, periods, comparatively, obsolete, fortifications, are, still, used, for, low, intensity, conflicts, such, fortifications, range, in, size, from, small, patrol, bases, or, forward, operating, bases, up, to, huge, airbases, such, as, camp, bastion, leatherneck, in, afghanistan, much, like, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, because, the, enemy, is, not, a, powerful, military, force, with, the, heavy, weaponry, required, to, destroy, fortifications, walls, of, gabion, sandbag, or, even, simple, mud, can, provide, protection, against, small, arms, and, anti, tank, weapons, although, such, fortifications, are, still, vulnerable, to, mortar, and, artillery, fire, forts, in, modern, american, usage, often, refer, to, space, set, aside, by, governments, for, a, permanent, military, facility, these, often, do, not, have, any, actual, fortifications, and, can, have, specializations, military, barracks, administration, medical, facilities, or, intelligence, however, there, are, some, modern, fortifications, that, are, referred, to, as, forts, these, are, typically, small, semi, permanent, fortifications, in, urban, combat, they, are, built, by, upgrading, existing, structures, such, as, houses, or, public, buildings, in, field, warfare, they, are, often, log, sandbag, or, gabion, type, construction, such, forts, are, typically, only, used, in, low, level, conflicts, such, as, counterinsurgency, conflicts, or, very, low, level, conventional, conflicts, such, as, the, indonesia, malaysia, confrontation, which, saw, the, use, of, log, forts, for, use, by, forward, platoons, and, companies, the, reason, for, this, is, that, static, above, ground, forts, cannot, survive, modern, direct, or, indirect, fire, weapons, larger, than, mortars, rpgs, and, small, arms, fortifications, designed, to, keep, the, inhabitants, of, a, facility, in, rather, than, attacker, out, can, also, be, found, in, prisons, concentration, camps, and, other, such, facilities, those, are, covered, in, other, articles, as, most, prisons, and, concentration, camps, are, not, primarily, military, forts, although, forts, camps, and, garrison, towns, have, been, used, as, prisons, and, or, concentration, camps, such, as, theresienstadt, guantanamo, bay, detention, camp, and, the, tower, of, london, for, example
