biofuel, is, a, fuel, that, is, produced, over, a, short, time, span, from, biomass, rather, than, by, the, very, slow, natural, processes, involved, in, the, formation, of, fossil, fuels, such, as, oil, biofuel, can, be, produced, from, plants, or, from, agricultural, domestic, or, industrial, biowaste, biofuels, are, mostly, used, for, transportation, but, can, also, be, used, for, heating, and, electricity, 173, biofuels, and, bioenergy, in, general, are, regarded, as, a, renewable, energy, source, 11, the, use, of, biofuel, has, been, subject, to, criticism, regarding, the, food, vs, fuel, debate, varied, assessments, of, their, sustainability, and, possible, deforestation, and, biodiversity, loss, as, a, result, of, biofuel, production, in, general, biofuels, emit, fewer, greenhouse, gas, emissions, when, burned, in, an, engine, and, are, generally, considered, carbon, neutral, fuels, as, the, carbon, emitted, has, been, captured, from, the, atmosphere, by, the, crops, used, in, production, however, life, cycle, assessments, of, biofuels, have, shown, large, emissions, associated, with, the, potential, land, use, change, required, to, produce, additional, biofuel, feedstocks, the, outcomes, of, lifecycle, assessments, lcas, for, biofuels, are, highly, situational, and, dependent, on, many, factors, including, the, type, of, feedstock, production, routes, data, variations, and, methodological, choices, this, could, be, added, to, emphasize, the, complexity, and, variability, in, assessing, the, environmental, impacts, of, biofuels, estimates, about, the, climate, impact, from, biofuels, vary, widely, based, on, the, methodology, and, exact, situation, examined, therefore, the, climate, change, mitigation, potential, of, biofuel, varies, considerably, in, some, scenarios, emission, levels, are, comparable, to, fossil, fuels, and, in, other, scenarios, the, biofuel, emissions, result, in, negative, emissions, global, demand, for, biofuels, is, predicted, to, increase, by, 56, over, 2022, 2027, by, 2027, worldwide, biofuel, production, is, expected, to, supply, 5, 4, of, the, world, s, fuels, for, transport, including, 1, of, aviation, fuel, demand, for, aviation, biofuel, is, forecast, to, increase, the, two, most, common, types, of, biofuel, are, bioethanol, and, biodiesel, brazil, is, the, largest, producer, of, bioethanol, while, the, eu, is, the, largest, producer, of, biodiesel, the, energy, content, in, the, global, production, of, bioethanol, and, biodiesel, is, 2, 2, and, 1, 8, ej, per, year, respectively, bioethanol, is, an, alcohol, made, by, fermentation, mostly, from, carbohydrates, produced, in, sugar, or, starch, crops, such, as, maize, sugarcane, or, sweet, sorghum, cellulosic, biomass, derived, from, non, food, sources, such, as, trees, and, grasses, is, also, being, developed, as, a, feedstock, for, ethanol, production, ethanol, can, be, used, as, a, fuel, for, vehicles, in, its, pure, form, e100, but, it, is, usually, used, as, a, gasoline, additive, to, increase, octane, ratings, and, improve, vehicle, emissions, biodiesel, is, produced, from, oils, or, fats, using, transesterification, it, can, be, used, as, a, fuel, for, vehicles, in, its, pure, form, b100, but, it, is, usually, used, as, a, diesel, additive, to, reduce, levels, of, particulates, carbon, monoxide, and, hydrocarbons, from, diesel, powered, vehicles, the, term, biofuel, is, used, in, different, ways, one, definition, is, biofuels, are, biobased, products, in, solid, liquid, or, gaseous, forms, they, are, produced, from, crops, or, natural, products, such, as, wood, or, agricultural, residues, such, as, molasses, and, bagasse, 173, other, publications, reserve, the, term, biofuel, for, liquid, or, gaseous, fuels, used, for, transportation, the, ipcc, sixth, assessment, report, defines, biofuel, as, a, fuel, generally, in, liquid, form, produced, from, biomass, biofuels, include, bioethanol, from, sugarcane, sugar, beet, or, maize, and, biodiesel, from, canola, or, soybeans, 1795, it, goes, on, to, define, biomass, in, this, context, as, organic, material, excluding, the, material, that, is, fossilised, or, embedded, in, geological, formations, 1795, this, means, that, coal, or, other, fossil, fuels, is, not, a, form, of, biomass, in, this, context, first, generation, biofuels, also, denoted, as, conventional, biofuels, are, made, from, food, crops, grown, on, arable, land, 447, the, crop, s, sugar, starch, or, oil, content, is, converted, into, biodiesel, or, ethanol, using, transesterification, or, yeast, fermentation, to, avoid, a, food, versus, fuel, dilemma, second, generation, biofuels, and, third, generation, biofuels, also, called, advanced, biofuels, or, sustainable, biofuels, or, drop, in, biofuels, are, made, from, feedstocks, which, do, not, directly, compete, with, food, or, feed, crop, such, as, waste, products, and, energy, crops, a, wide, range, of, waste, feedstocks, such, as, those, derived, from, agriculture, and, forestry, activities, like, rice, straw, rice, husk, wood, chips, and, sawdust, can, be, used, to, produce, advanced, biofuels, through, biochemical, and, thermochemical, processes, 448, the, feedstock, used, to, make, the, fuels, either, grow, on, arable, land, but, are, byproducts, of, the, main, crop, or, they, are, grown, on, marginal, land, second, generation, feedstocks, also, include, straw, bagasse, perennial, grasses, jatropha, waste, vegetable, oil, municipal, solid, waste, and, so, forth, biologically, produced, alcohols, most, commonly, ethanol, and, less, commonly, propanol, and, butanol, are, produced, by, the, action, of, microorganisms, and, enzymes, through, the, fermentation, of, sugars, or, starches, easiest, to, produce, or, cellulose, more, difficult, to, produce, the, iea, estimates, that, ethanol, production, used, 20, of, sugar, supplies, and, 13, of, corn, supplies, in, 2021, ethanol, fuel, is, the, most, common, biofuel, worldwide, particularly, in, brazil, alcohol, fuels, are, produced, by, fermentation, of, sugars, derived, from, wheat, corn, sugar, beets, sugar, cane, molasses, and, any, sugar, or, starch, from, which, alcoholic, beverages, such, as, whiskey, can, be, made, such, as, potato, and, fruit, waste, etc, production, methods, used, are, enzyme, digestion, to, release, sugars, from, stored, starches, fermentation, of, the, sugars, distillation, and, drying, the, distillation, process, requires, significant, energy, input, to, generate, heat, heat, is, sometimes, generated, with, unsustainable, natural, gas, fossil, fuel, but, cellulosic, biomass, such, as, bagasse, is, the, most, common, fuel, in, brazil, while, pellets, wood, chips, and, also, waste, heat, are, more, common, in, europe, corn, to, ethanol, and, other, food, stocks, has, led, to, the, development, of, cellulosic, ethanol, methanol, is, currently, produced, from, natural, gas, a, non, renewable, fossil, fuel, in, the, future, it, is, hoped, to, be, produced, from, biomass, as, biomethanol, this, is, technically, feasible, but, the, production, is, currently, being, postponed, for, concerns, that, the, economic, viability, is, still, pending, the, methanol, economy, is, an, alternative, to, the, hydrogen, economy, to, be, contrasted, with, today, s, hydrogen, production, from, natural, gas, butanol, c, 4, h, 9, oh, is, formed, by, abe, fermentation, acetone, butanol, ethanol, and, experimental, modifications, of, the, process, show, potentially, high, net, energy, gains, with, biobutanol, as, the, only, liquid, product, biobutanol, is, often, claimed, to, provide, a, direct, replacement, for, gasoline, because, it, will, produce, more, energy, than, ethanol, and, allegedly, can, be, burned, straight, in, existing, gasoline, engines, without, modification, to, the, engine, or, car, is, less, corrosive, and, less, water, soluble, than, ethanol, and, could, be, distributed, via, existing, infrastructures, escherichia, coli, strains, have, also, been, successfully, engineered, to, produce, butanol, by, modifying, their, amino, acid, metabolism, one, drawback, to, butanol, production, in, e, coli, remains, the, high, cost, of, nutrient, rich, media, however, recent, work, has, demonstrated, e, coli, can, produce, butanol, with, minimal, nutritional, supplementation, biobutanol, is, sometimes, called, biogasoline, which, is, incorrect, as, it, is, chemically, different, being, an, alcohol, and, not, a, hydrocarbon, like, gasoline, biodiesel, is, the, most, common, biofuel, in, europe, it, is, produced, from, oils, or, fats, using, transesterification, and, is, a, liquid, similar, in, composition, to, fossil, mineral, diesel, chemically, it, consists, mostly, of, fatty, acid, methyl, or, ethyl, esters, fames, feedstocks, for, biodiesel, include, animal, fats, vegetable, oils, soy, rapeseed, jatropha, mahua, mustard, flax, sunflower, palm, oil, hemp, field, pennycress, pongamia, pinnata, and, algae, pure, biodiesel, b100, also, known, as, neat, biodiesel, currently, reduces, emissions, with, up, to, 60, compared, to, diesel, second, generation, b100, as, of, 2020, researchers, at, australia, s, csiro, have, been, studying, safflower, oil, as, an, engine, lubricant, and, researchers, at, montana, state, university, s, advanced, fuels, center, in, the, us, have, been, studying, the, oil, s, performance, in, a, large, diesel, engine, with, results, described, as, a, breakthrough, biodiesel, can, be, used, in, any, diesel, engine, and, modified, equipment, when, mixed, with, mineral, diesel, it, can, also, be, used, in, its, pure, form, b100, in, diesel, engines, but, some, maintenance, and, performance, problems, may, occur, during, wintertime, utilization, since, the, fuel, becomes, somewhat, more, viscous, at, lower, temperatures, depending, on, the, feedstock, used, electronically, controlled, common, rail, and, unit, injector, type, systems, from, the, late, 1990s, onwards, can, only, use, biodiesel, blended, with, conventional, diesel, fuel, these, engines, have, finely, metered, and, atomized, multiple, stage, injection, systems, that, are, very, sensitive, to, the, viscosity, of, the, fuel, many, current, generation, diesel, engines, are, designed, to, run, on, b100, without, altering, the, engine, itself, although, this, depends, on, the, fuel, rail, design, since, biodiesel, is, an, effective, solvent, and, cleans, residues, deposited, by, mineral, diesel, engine, filters, may, need, to, be, replaced, more, often, as, the, biofuel, dissolves, old, deposits, in, the, fuel, tank, and, pipes, it, also, effectively, cleans, the, engine, combustion, chamber, of, carbon, deposits, helping, to, maintain, efficiency, biodiesel, is, an, oxygenated, fuel, meaning, it, contains, a, reduced, amount, of, carbon, and, higher, hydrogen, and, oxygen, content, than, fossil, diesel, this, improves, the, combustion, of, biodiesel, and, reduces, the, particulate, emissions, from, unburnt, carbon, however, using, pure, biodiesel, may, increase, no, x, emissions, biodiesel, is, also, safe, to, handle, and, transport, because, it, is, non, toxic, and, biodegradable, and, has, a, high, flash, point, of, about, 300, f, 148, c, compared, to, petroleum, diesel, fuel, which, has, a, flash, point, of, 125, f, 52, c, in, many, european, countries, a, 5, biodiesel, blend, is, widely, used, and, is, available, at, thousands, of, gas, stations, in, france, biodiesel, is, incorporated, at, a, rate, of, 8, in, the, fuel, used, by, all, french, diesel, vehicles, avril, group, produces, under, the, brand, diester, a, fifth, of, 11, million, tons, of, biodiesel, consumed, annually, by, the, european, union, it, is, the, leading, european, producer, of, biodiesel, green, diesel, can, be, produced, from, a, combination, of, biochemical, and, thermochemical, processes, conventional, green, diesel, is, produced, through, hydroprocessing, biological, oil, feedstocks, such, as, vegetable, oils, and, animal, fats, recently, it, is, produced, using, series, of, thermochemical, processes, such, as, pyrolysis, and, hydroprocessing, in, the, thermochemical, route, syngas, produced, from, gasification, bio, oil, produced, from, pyrolysis, or, biocrude, produced, from, hydrothermal, liquefaction, is, upgraded, to, green, diesel, using, hydroprocessing, hydroprocessing, is, the, process, of, using, hydrogen, to, reform, a, molecular, structure, for, example, hydrocracking, which, is, a, widely, used, hydroprocessing, technique, in, refineries, is, used, at, elevated, temperatures, and, pressure, in, the, presence, of, a, catalyst, to, break, down, larger, molecules, such, as, those, found, in, vegetable, oils, into, shorter, hydrocarbon, chains, used, in, diesel, engines, green, diesel, may, also, be, called, renewable, diesel, drop, in, biodiesel, hydrotreated, vegetable, oil, hvo, fuel, or, hydrogen, derived, renewable, diesel, unlike, biodiesel, green, diesel, has, exactly, the, same, chemical, properties, as, petroleum, based, diesel, it, does, not, require, new, engines, pipelines, or, infrastructure, to, distribute, and, use, but, has, not, been, produced, at, a, cost, that, is, competitive, with, petroleum, gasoline, versions, are, also, being, developed, green, diesel, is, being, developed, in, louisiana, and, singapore, by, conocophillips, neste, oil, valero, dynamic, fuels, and, honeywell, uop, as, well, as, preem, in, gothenburg, sweden, creating, what, is, known, as, evolution, diesel, straight, unmodified, edible, vegetable, oil, is, generally, not, used, as, fuel, but, lower, quality, oil, has, been, used, for, this, purpose, used, vegetable, oil, is, increasingly, being, processed, into, biodiesel, or, more, rarely, cleaned, of, water, and, particulates, and, then, used, as, a, fuel, the, iea, estimates, that, biodiesel, production, used, 17, of, global, vegetable, oil, supplies, in, 2021, oils, and, fats, reacted, with, 10, pounds, of, a, short, chain, alcohol, usually, methanol, in, the, presence, of, a, catalyst, usually, sodium, hydroxide, can, be, hydrogenated, to, give, a, diesel, substitute, the, resulting, product, is, a, straight, chain, hydrocarbon, with, a, high, cetane, number, low, in, aromatics, and, sulfur, and, does, not, contain, oxygen, hydrogenated, oils, can, be, blended, with, diesel, in, all, proportions, they, have, several, advantages, over, biodiesel, including, good, performance, at, low, temperatures, no, storage, stability, problems, and, no, susceptibility, to, microbial, attack, biogasoline, can, be, produced, biologically, and, themochemically, using, biologicalical, methods, a, study, led, by, professor, lee, sang, yup, at, the, korea, advanced, institute, of, science, and, technology, kaist, and, published, in, the, international, science, journal, nature, used, modified, e, coli, fed, with, glucose, found, in, plants, or, other, non, food, crops, to, produce, biogasoline, with, the, produced, enzymes, the, enzymes, converted, the, sugar, into, fatty, acids, and, then, turned, these, into, hydrocarbons, that, were, chemically, and, structurally, identical, to, those, found, in, commercial, gasoline, fuel, the, thermochemical, approach, of, producing, biogasoline, are, similar, to, those, used, to, produced, biodiesel, biogasoline, may, also, be, called, drop, in, gasoline, or, renewable, gasoline, bioethers, also, referred, to, as, fuel, ethers, or, oxygenated, fuels, are, cost, effective, compounds, that, act, as, octane, rating, enhancers, bioethers, are, produced, by, the, reaction, of, reactive, iso, olefins, such, as, iso, butylene, with, bioethanol, bioethers, are, created, from, wheat, or, sugar, beets, and, also, be, produced, from, the, waste, glycerol, that, results, from, the, production, of, biodiesel, they, also, enhance, engine, performance, while, significantly, reducing, engine, wear, and, toxic, exhaust, emissions, by, greatly, reducing, the, amount, of, ground, level, ozone, emissions, they, contribute, to, improved, air, quality, in, transportation, fuel, there, are, six, ether, additives, dimethyl, ether, dme, diethyl, ether, dee,

typically, by, reducing, protons, to, hydrogen, or, carbon, dioxide, to, organic, compounds, a, bio, digester, is, a, mechanized, toilet, that, uses, decomposition, and, sedimentation, to, turn, human, waste, into, a, renewable, fuel, called, biogas, biogas, can, be, made, from, substances, like, agricultural, waste, and, sewage, the, bio, digester, uses, a, process, called, anaerobic, digestion, to, produce, biogas, anaerobic, digestion, uses, a, chemical, process, to, break, down, organic, matter, with, the, use, of, microorganisms, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, to, produce, biogas, the, processes, involved, in, anaerobic, respiration, are, hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis, and, methanogenesis, global, biofuel, production, was, 81, mtoe, in, 2017, which, represented, an, annual, increase, of, about, 3, compared, to, 2010, 12, in, 2017, the, us, was, the, largest, biofuel, producer, in, the, world, producing, 37, mtoe, followed, by, brazil, and, south, america, at, 23, mtoe, and, europe, mainly, germany, at, 12, mtoe, 12, an, assessment, from, 2017, found, that, biofuels, will, never, be, a, major, transport, fuel, as, there, is, just, not, enough, land, in, the, world, to, grow, plants, to, make, biofuel, for, all, vehicles, it, can, however, be, part, of, an, energy, mix, to, take, us, into, a, future, of, renewable, energy, 11, in, 2021, worldwide, biofuel, production, provided, 4, 3, of, the, world, s, fuels, for, transport, including, a, very, small, amount, of, aviation, biofuel, by, 2027, worldwide, biofuel, production, is, expected, to, supply, 5, 4, of, the, world, s, fuels, for, transport, including, 1, of, aviation, fuel, the, us, europe, brazil, and, indonesia, are, driving, the, majority, of, biofuel, consumption, growth, this, demand, for, biodiesel, renewable, diesel, and, biojet, fuel, is, projected, to, increase, by, 44, 21, billion, litres, over, 2022, 2027, issues, relating, to, biofuel, are, social, economic, environmental, and, technical, problems, that, may, arise, from, biofuel, production, and, use, social, and, economic, issues, include, the, food, vs, fuel, debate, and, the, need, to, develop, responsible, policies, and, economic, instruments, to, ensure, sustainable, biofuel, production, farming, for, biofuels, feedstock, can, be, detrimental, to, the, environment, if, not, done, sustainably, environmental, concerns, include, deforestation, biodiversity, loss, and, soil, erosion, as, a, result, of, land, clearing, for, biofuels, agriculture, while, biofuels, can, contribute, to, reduction, in, global, carbon, emissions, indirect, land, use, change, for, biofuel, production, can, have, the, inverse, effect, technical, issues, include, possible, modifications, necessary, to, run, the, engine, on, biofuel, as, well, as, energy, balance, and, efficiency, estimates, about, the, climate, impact, from, biofuels, vary, widely, based, on, the, methodology, and, exact, situation, examined, in, general, biofuels, emit, fewer, greenhouse, gas, emissions, when, burned, in, an, engine, and, are, generally, considered, carbon, neutral, fuels, as, the, carbon, they, emit, has, been, captured, from, the, atmosphere, by, the, crops, used, in, biofuel, production, they, can, have, greenhouse, gas, emissions, ranging, from, as, low, as, 127, 1, gco, 2, eq, per, mj, when, carbon, capture, is, incorporated, into, their, production, to, those, exceeding, 95, gco, 2, eq, per, mj, when, land, use, change, is, significant, several, factors, are, responsible, for, the, variation, in, emission, numbers, of, biofuel, such, as, feedstock, and, its, origin, fuel, production, technique, system, boundary, definitions, and, energy, sources, however, many, government, policies, such, as, those, by, european, union, and, the, uk, require, that, biofuels, have, at, least, 65, greenhouse, gas, emissions, savings, or, 70, if, it, is, renewable, fuels, of, non, biological, origins, relative, to, fossil, fuels, life, cycle, assessments, of, first, generation, biofuels, have, shown, large, emissions, associated, with, the, potential, land, use, change, required, to, produce, additional, biofuel, feedstocks, if, no, land, use, change, is, involved, first, generation, biofuels, can, on, average, have, lower, emissions, than, fossil, fuels, however, biofuel, production, can, compete, with, food, crop, production, up, to, 40, of, corn, produced, in, the, united, states, is, used, to, make, ethanol, and, worldwide, 10, of, all, grain, is, turned, into, biofuel, a, 50, reduction, in, grain, used, for, biofuels, in, the, us, and, europe, would, replace, all, of, ukraine, s, grain, exports, several, studies, have, shown, that, reductions, in, emissions, from, biofuels, are, achieved, at, the, expense, of, other, impacts, such, as, acidification, eutrophication, water, footprint, and, biodiversity, loss, the, use, of, second, generation, biofuels, is, thought, to, increase, environmental, sustainability, since, the, non, food, part, of, plants, is, being, used, to, produce, second, generation, biofuels, instead, of, being, disposed, but, the, use, of, second, generation, biofuels, increases, the, competition, for, lignocellulosic, biomass, increasing, the, cost, of, these, biofuels, third, generation, biofuels, produced, from, algae, in, theory, shouldn, t, have, a, negative, impact, on, the, environment, than, the, first, or, second, generation, biofuels, due, to, lower, changes, in, land, use, and, not, requiring, pesticide, use, for, production, when, looking, at, the, data, however, it, has, been, shown, that, the, environmental, cost, to, produce, the, infrastructure, and, energy, required, for, third, generation, biofuel, production, are, higher, than, the, benefits, provided, from, the, biofuels, use, the, european, commission, has, officially, approved, a, measure, to, phase, out, palm, oil, based, biofuels, by, 2030, unsustainable, palm, oil, agriculture, has, caused, significant, environmental, and, social, problems, including, deforestation, and, pollution, the, production, of, biofuels, can, be, very, energy, intensive, which, if, generated, from, non, renewable, sources, can, heavily, mitigate, the, benefits, gained, through, biofuel, use, a, solution, proposed, to, solve, this, issue, is, to, supply, biofuel, production, facilities, with, excess, nuclear, energy, which, can, supplement, the, energy, provided, by, fossil, fuels, this, can, provide, a, carbon, inexpensive, solution, to, help, reduce, the, environmental, impacts, of, biofuel, production, the, indirect, land, use, change, impacts, of, biofuels, also, known, as, iluc, or, iluc, pronounced, as, i, luck, relates, to, the, unintended, consequence, of, releasing, more, carbon, emissions, due, to, land, use, changes, around, the, world, induced, by, the, expansion, of, croplands, for, ethanol, or, biodiesel, production, in, response, to, the, increased, global, demand, for, biofuels, as, farmers, worldwide, respond, to, higher, crop, prices, in, order, to, maintain, the, global, food, supply, and, demand, balance, pristine, lands, are, cleared, to, replace, the, food, crops, that, were, diverted, elsewhere, to, biofuels, production, because, natural, lands, such, as, rainforests, and, grasslands, store, carbon, in, their, soil, and, biomass, as, plants, grow, each, year, clearance, of, wilderness, for, new, farms, translates, to, a, net, increase, in, greenhouse, gas, emissions, due, to, this, off, site, change, in, the, carbon, stock, of, the, soil, and, the, biomass, indirect, land, use, change, has, consequences, in, the, greenhouse, gas, ghg, balance, of, a,
