paper, is, a, thin, sheet, material, produced, by, mechanically, or, chemically, processing, cellulose, fibres, derived, from, wood, rags, grasses, or, other, vegetable, sources, in, water, draining, the, water, through, a, fine, mesh, leaving, the, fibre, evenly, distributed, on, the, surface, followed, by, pressing, and, drying, although, paper, was, originally, made, in, single, sheets, by, hand, almost, all, is, now, made, on, large, machines, some, making, reels, 10, metres, wide, running, at, 2, 000, metres, per, minute, and, up, to, 600, 000, tonnes, a, year, it, is, a, versatile, material, with, many, uses, including, printing, painting, graphics, signage, design, packaging, decorating, writing, and, cleaning, it, may, also, be, used, as, filter, paper, wallpaper, book, endpaper, conservation, paper, laminated, worktops, toilet, tissue, currency, and, security, paper, or, in, a, number, of, industrial, and, construction, processes, the, papermaking, process, developed, in, east, asia, probably, china, at, least, as, early, as, 105, ce, by, the, han, court, eunuch, cai, lun, although, the, earliest, archaeological, fragments, of, paper, derive, from, the, 2nd, century, bce, in, china, the, modern, pulp, and, paper, industry, is, global, with, china, leading, its, production, and, the, united, states, following, the, oldest, known, archaeological, fragments, of, the, immediate, precursor, to, modern, paper, date, to, the, 2nd, century, bce, in, china, the, pulp, papermaking, process, is, ascribed, to, cai, lun, a, 2nd, century, ce, han, court, eunuch, it, has, been, said, that, knowledge, of, papermaking, was, passed, to, the, islamic, world, after, the, battle, of, talas, in, 751, ce, when, two, chinese, papermakers, were, captured, as, prisoners, although, the, veracity, of, this, story, is, uncertain, paper, started, to, be, made, in, samarkand, soon, after, in, the, 13th, century, the, knowledge, and, uses, of, paper, spread, from, the, middle, east, to, medieval, europe, where, the, first, water, powered, paper, mills, were, built, because, paper, was, introduced, to, the, west, through, the, city, of, baghdad, it, was, first, called, bagdatikos, in, the, 19th, century, industrialization, greatly, reduced, the, cost, of, manufacturing, paper, in, 1844, the, canadian, inventor, charles, fenerty, and, the, german, inventor, friedrich, gottlob, keller, independently, developed, processes, for, pulping, wood, fibres, before, the, industrialisation, of, paper, production, the, most, common, fibre, source, was, recycled, fibres, from, used, textiles, called, rags, the, rags, were, from, hemp, linen, and, cotton, a, process, for, removing, printing, inks, from, recycled, paper, was, invented, by, german, jurist, justus, claproth, in, 1774, today, this, method, is, called, deinking, it, was, not, until, the, introduction, of, wood, pulp, in, 1843, that, paper, production, was, not, dependent, on, recycled, materials, from, ragpickers, the, word, paper, is, etymologically, derived, from, latin, papyrus, which, comes, from, the, greek, p, p, ros, the, word, for, the, cyperus, papyrus, plant, papyrus, is, a, thick, paper, like, material, produced, from, the, pith, of, the, cyperus, papyrus, plant, which, was, used, in, ancient, egypt, and, other, mediterranean, cultures, for, writing, before, the, introduction, of, paper, although, the, word, paper, is, etymologically, derived, from, papyrus, the, two, are, produced, very, differently, and, the, development, of, the, first, is, distinct, from, the, development, of, the, second, papyrus, is, a, lamination, of, natural, plant, fibre, while, paper, is, manufactured, from, fibres, whose, properties, have, been, changed, by, maceration, to, make, pulp, from, wood, a, chemical, pulping, process, separates, lignin, from, cellulose, fibre, a, cooking, liquor, is, used, to, dissolve, the, lignin, which, is, then, washed, from, the, cellulose, this, preserves, the, length, of, the, cellulose, fibres, paper, made, from, chemical, pulps, are, also, known, as, wood, free, papers, not, to, be, confused, with, tree, free, paper, this, is, because, they, do, not, contain, lignin, which, deteriorates, over, time, the, pulp, can, also, be, bleached, to, produce, white, paper, but, this, consumes, 5, of, the, fibres, chemical, pulping, processes, are, not, used, to, make, paper, made, from, cotton, which, is, already, 90, cellulose, there, are, three, main, chemical, pulping, processes, the, sulfite, process, dates, back, to, the, 1840s, and, was, the, dominant, method, before, the, second, world, war, the, kraft, process, invented, in, the, 1870s, and, first, used, in, the, 1890s, is, now, the, most, commonly, practised, strategy, one, of, its, advantages, is, the, chemical, reaction, with, lignin, produces, heat, which, can, be, used, to, run, a, generator, most, pulping, operations, using, the, kraft, process, are, net, contributors, to, the, electricity, grid, or, use, the, electricity, to, run, an, adjacent, paper, mill, another, advantage, is, that, this, process, recovers, and, reuses, all, inorganic, chemical, reagents, soda, pulping, is, another, specialty, process, used, to, pulp, straws, bagasse, and, hardwoods, with, high, silicate, content, there, are, two, major, mechanical, pulps, thermomechanical, pulp, tmp, and, groundwood, pulp, gw, in, the, tmp, process, wood, is, chipped, and, then, fed, into, steam, heated, refiners, where, the, chips, are, squeezed, and, converted, to, fibres, between, two, steel, discs, in, the, groundwood, process, debarked, logs, are, fed, into, grinders, where, they, are, pressed, against, rotating, stones, to, be, made, into, fibres, mechanical, pulping, does, not, remove, the, lignin, so, the, yield, is, very, high, 95, however, lignin, causes, the, paper, thus, produced, to, turn, yellow, and, become, brittle, over, time, mechanical, pulps, have, rather, short, fibres, thus, producing, weak, paper, although, large, amounts, of, electrical, energy, are, required, to, produce, mechanical, pulp, it, costs, less, than, the, chemical, kind, paper, recycling, processes, can, use, either, chemically, or, mechanically, produced, pulp, by, mixing, it, with, water, and, applying, mechanical, action, the, hydrogen, bonds, in, the, paper, can, be, broken, and, fibres, separated, again, most, recycled, paper, contains, a, proportion, of, virgin, fibre, for, the, sake, of, quality, generally, speaking, de, inked, pulp, is, of, the, same, quality, or, lower, than, the, collected, paper, it, was, made, from, there, are, three, main, classifications, of, recycled, fibre, recycled, papers, can, be, made, from, 100, recycled, materials, or, blended, with, virgin, pulp, although, they, are, generally, not, as, strong, nor, as, bright, as, papers, made, from, the, latter, besides, the, fibres, pulps, may, contain, fillers, such, as, chalk, or, china, clay, which, improve, its, characteristics, for, printing, or, writing, additives, for, sizing, purposes, may, be, mixed, with, it, or, applied, to, the, paper, web, later, in, the, manufacturing, process, the, purpose, of, such, sizing, is, to, establish, the, correct, level, of, surface, absorbency, to, suit, ink, or, paint, the, pulp, is, fed, to, a, paper, machine, where, it, is, formed, as, a, paper, web, and, the, water, is, removed, from, it, by, pressing, and, drying, pressing, the, sheet, removes, the, water, by, force, once, the, water, is, forced, from, the, sheet, a, special, kind, of, felt, which, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, traditional, one, is, used, to, collect, the, water, when, making, paper, by, hand, a, blotter, sheet, is, used, instead, drying, involves, using, air, or, heat, to, remove, water, from, the, paper, sheets, in, the, earliest, days, of, papermaking, this, was, done, by, hanging, the, sheets, like, laundry, in, more, modern, times, various, forms, of, heated, drying, mechanisms, are, used, on, the, paper, machine, the, most, common, is, the, steam, heated, can, dryer, these, can, reach, temperatures, above, 93, c, 200, f, and, are, used, in, long, sequences, of, more, than, forty, cans, where, the, heat, produced, by, these, can, easily, dry, the, paper, to, less, than, six, percent, moisture, the, paper, may, then, undergo, sizing, to, alter, its, physical, properties, for, use, in, various, applications, paper, at, this, point, is, uncoated, coated, paper, has, a, thin, layer, of, material, such, as, calcium, carbonate, or, china, clay, applied, to, one, or, both, sides, in, order, to, create, a, surface, more, suitable, for, high, resolution, halftone, screens, uncoated, papers, are, rarely, suitable, for, screens, above, 150, lpi, coated, or, uncoated, papers, may, have, their, surfaces, polished, by, calendering, coated, papers, are, divided, into, matte, semi, matte, or, silk, and, gloss, gloss, papers, give, the, highest, optical, density, in, the, printed, image, the, paper, is, then, fed, onto, reels, if, it, is, to, be, used, on, web, printing, presses, or, cut, into, sheets, for, other, printing, processes, or, other, purposes, the, fibres, in, the, paper, basically, run, in, the, machine, direction, sheets, are, usually, cut, long, grain, i, e, with, the, grain, parallel, to, the, longer, dimension, of, the, sheet, continuous, form, paper, or, continuous, stationery, is, cut, to, width, with, holes, punched, at, the, edges, and, folded, into, stacks, all, paper, produced, by, paper, machines, such, as, the, fourdrinier, machine, are, wove, paper, i, e, the, wire, mesh, that, transports, the, web, leaves, a, pattern, that, has, the, same, density, along, the, paper, grain, and, across, the, grain, textured, finishes, watermarks, and, wire, patterns, imitating, hand, made, laid, paper, can, be, created, by, the, use, of, appropriate, rollers, in, the, later, stages, of, the, machine, wove, paper, does, not, exhibit, laidlines, which, are, small, regular, lines, left, behind, on, paper, when, it, was, handmade, in, a, mould, made, from, rows, of, metal, wires, or, bamboo, laidlines, are, very, close, together, they, run, perpendicular, to, the, chainlines, which, are, further, apart, handmade, paper, similarly, exhibits, deckle, edges, or, rough, and, feathery, borders, paper, can, be, produced, with, a, wide, variety, of, properties, depending, on, its, intended, use, it, is, estimated, that, paper, based, storage, solutions, captured, 0, 33, of, the, total, in, 1986, and, only, 0, 007, in, 2007, even, though, in, absolute, terms, the, world, s, capacity, to, store, information, on, paper, increased, from, 8, 7, to, 19, 4, petabytes, it, is, estimated, that, in, 1986, paper, based, postal, letters, represented, less, than, 0, 05, of, the, world, s, telecommunication, capacity, with, sharply, decreasing, tendency, after, the, massive, introduction, of, digital, technologies, paper, has, a, major, role, in, the, visual, arts, it, is, used, by, itself, to, form, two, and, three, dimensional, shapes, and, collages, it, has, also, evolved, to, being, a, structural, material, used, in, furniture, design, watercolor, paper, has, a, long, history, of, production, and, use, the, thickness, of, paper, is, often, measured, by, caliper, which, is, typically, given, in, thousandths, of, an, inch, in, the, united, states, and, in, micrometres, m, in, the, rest, of, the, world, paper, may, be, between, 0, 07, and, 0, 18, millimetres, 0, 0028, and, 0, 0071, in, thick, paper, is, often, characterized, by, weight, in, the, united, states, the, weight, is, the, weight, of, a, ream, bundle, of, 500, sheets, of, varying, basic, sizes, before, the, paper, is, cut, into, the, size, it, is, sold, to, end, customers, for, example, a, ream, of, 20, lb, 8, 5, in, 11, in, 216, mm, 279, mm, paper, weighs, 5, pounds, because, it, has, been, cut, from, larger, sheets, into, four, pieces, in, the, united, states, printing, paper, is, generally, 20, lb, 24, lb, 28, lb, or, 32, lb, at, most, cover, stock, is, generally, 68, lb, and, 110, lb, or, more, is, considered, card, stock, in, europe, and, other, regions, using, the, iso, 216, paper, sizing, system, the, weight, is, expressed, in, grams, per, square, metre, g, m, 2, or, usually, gsm, of, the, paper, printing, paper, is, generally, between, 60, gsm, and, 120, gsm, anything, heavier, than, 160, gsm, is, considered, card, the, weight, of, a, ream, therefore, depends, on, the, dimensions, of, the, paper, and, its, thickness, most, commercial, paper, sold, in, north, america, is, cut, to, standard, paper, sizes, based, on, customary, units, and, is, defined, by, the, length, and, width, of, a, sheet, of, paper, the, iso, 216, system, used, in, most, other, countries, is, based, on, the, surface, area, of, a, sheet, of, paper, not, on, a, sheet, s, width, and, length, it, was, first, adopted, in, germany, in, 1922, and, generally, spread, as, nations, adopted, the, metric, system, the, largest, standard, size, paper, is, a0, a, zero, measuring, one, square, metre, approx, 1189, 841, mm, a1, is, half, the, size, of, a, sheet, of, a0, i, e, 594, mm, 841, mm, such, that, two, sheets, of, a1, placed, side, by, side, are, equal, to, one, sheet, of, a0, a2, is, half, the, size, of, a, sheet, of, a1, and, so, forth, common, sizes, used, in, the, office, and, the, home, are, a4, and, a3, a3, is, the, size, of, two, a4, sheets, the, density, of, paper, ranges, from, 250, kg, m, 3, 16, lb, cu, ft, for, tissue, paper, to, 1, 500, kg, m, 3, 94, lb, cu, ft, for, some, specialty, paper, printing, paper, is, about, 800, kg, m, 3, 50, lb, cu, ft, paper, may, be, classified, into, seven, categories, some, paper, types, include, much, of, the, early, paper, made, from, wood, pulp, contained, significant, amounts, of, alum, a, variety, of, aluminium, sulfate, salt, that, is, significantly, acidic, alum, was, added, to, paper, to, assist, in, sizing, making, it, somewhat, water, resistant, so, that, inks, did, not, run, or, spread, uncontrollably, early, papermakers, did, not, realize, that, the, alum, they, added, liberally, to, cure, almost, every, problem, encountered, in, making, their, product, would, be, eventually, detrimental, the, cellulose, fibres, that, make, up, paper, are, hydrolyzed, by, acid, and, the, presence, of, alum, eventually, degrades, the, fibres, until, the, acidic, paper, disintegrates, in, a, process, known, as, slow, fire, documents, written, on, rag, paper, are, significantly, more, stable, the, use, of, non, acidic, additives, to, make, paper, is, becoming, more, prevalent, and, the, stability, of, these, papers, is, less, of, an, issue, paper, made, from, mechanical, pulp, contains, significant, amounts, of, lignin, a, major, component, in, wood, in, the, presence, of, light, and, oxygen, lignin, reacts, to, give, yellow, materials, which, is, why, newsprint, and, other, mechanical, paper, yellows, with, age, paper, made, from, bleached, kraft, or, sulfite, pulps, does, not, contain, significant, amounts, of, lignin, and, is, therefore, better, suited, for, books, documents, and, other, applications, where, whiteness, of, the, paper, is, essential, paper, made, from, wood, pulp, is, not, necessarily, less, durable, than, a, rag, paper, the, aging, behaviour, of, a, paper, is, determined, by, its, manufacture, not, the, original, source, of, the, fibres, furthermore, tests, sponsored, by, the, library, of, congress, prove, that, all, paper, is, at, risk, of, acid, decay, because, cellulose, itself, produces, formic, acetic, lactic, and, oxalic, acids, mechanical, pulping, yields, almost, a, tonne, of, pulp, per, tonne, of, dry, wood, used, which, is, why, mechanical, pulps, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, high, yield, pulps, with, almost, twice, the, yield, as, chemical, pulping, mechanical, pulps, is, often, cheaper, mass, market, paperback, books, and, newspapers, tend, to, use, mechanical, papers, book, publishers, tend, to, use, acid, free, paper, made, from, fully, bleached, chemical, pulps, for, hardback, and, trade, paperback, books, the, production, and, use, of, paper, has, a, number, of, adverse, effects, on, the, environment, worldwide, consumption, of, paper, has, risen, by, 400, in, the, past, 40, years, leading, to, increase, in, deforestation, with, 35, of, harvested, trees, being, used, for, paper, manufacture, most, paper, companies, also, plant, trees, to, help, regrow, forests, logging, of, old, growth, forests, accounts, for, less, than, 10, of, wood, pulp, but, is, one, of, the, most, controversial, issues, paper, waste, accounts, for, up, to, 40, of, total, waste, produced, in, the, united, states, each, year, which, adds, up, to, 71, 6, million, tons, of, paper, waste, per, year, in, the, united, states, alone, the, average, office, worker, in, the, us, prints, 31, pages, every, day, americans, also, use, in, the, order, of, 16, billion, paper, cups, per, year, conventional, bleaching, of, wood, pulp, using, elemental, chlorine, produces, and, releases, into, the, environment, large, amounts, of, chlorinated, organic, compounds, including, chlorinated, dioxins, dioxins, are, recognized, as, a, persistent, environmental, pollutant, regulated, internationally, by, the, stockholm, convention, on, persistent, organic, pollutants, dioxins, are, highly, toxic, and, health, effects, on, humans, include, reproductive, developmental, immune, and, hormonal, problems, they, are, known, to, be, carcinogenic, over, 90, of, human, exposure, is, through, food, primarily, meat, dairy, fish, and, shellfish, as, dioxins, accumulate, in, the, food, chain, in, the, fatty, tissue, of, animals, the, paper, pulp, and, print, industries, emitted, together, about, 1, of, world, greenhouse, gas, emissions, in, 2010, and, about, 0, 9, in, 2012, in, the, 2022, 2024, edition, of, the, annual, pulp, and, paper, capacites, survey, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, of, the, united, nations, fao, reports, that, asia, has, superseded, north, america, as, the, top, pulp, and, paper, producing, continent, fao, figures, for, 2021, show, the, production, of, graphic, papers, continuing, its, decline, from, a, mid, 2000s, peak, to, hover, below, 100, million, tonnes, a, year, by, contrast, the, production, of, other, papers, and, paperboard, which, includes, cardboard, and, sanitary, products, has, continued, to, soar, exceeding, 320, million, tonnes, fao, has, documented, the, expanding, production, of, cardboard, in, paper, and, paperboard, which, has, been, increasing, in, response, to, the, spread, of, e, commerce, since, the, 2010s, data, from, fao, suggest, that, it, has, been, even, further, boosted, by, covid, 19, related, lockdowns, some, manufacturers, have, started, using, a, new, significantly, more, environmentally, friendly, alternative, to, expanded, plastic, packaging, made, out, of, paper, and, known, commercially, as, paperfoam, the, new, packaging, has, mechanical, properties, very, similar, to, those, of, some, expanded, plastic, packaging, but, is, biodegradable, and, can, also, be, recycled, with, ordinary, paper, with, increasing, environmental, concerns, about, synthetic, coatings, such, as, pfoa, and, the, higher, prices, of, hydrocarbon, based, petrochemicals, there, is, a, focus, on, zein, corn, protein, as, a, coating, for, paper, in, high, grease, applications, such, as, popcorn, bags, also, synthetics, such, as, tyvek, and, teslin, have, been, introduced, as, printing, media, as, a, more, durable, material, than, paper
