radiography, is, an, imaging, technique, using, x, rays, gamma, rays, or, similar, ionizing, radiation, and, non, ionizing, radiation, to, view, the, internal, form, of, an, object, applications, of, radiography, include, medical, diagnostic, radiography, and, therapeutic, and, industrial, radiography, similar, techniques, are, used, in, airport, security, where, body, scanners, generally, use, backscatter, x, ray, to, create, an, image, in, conventional, radiography, a, beam, of, x, rays, is, produced, by, an, x, ray, generator, and, it, is, projected, towards, the, object, a, certain, amount, of, the, x, rays, or, other, radiation, are, absorbed, by, the, object, dependent, on, the, object, s, density, and, structural, composition, the, x, rays, that, pass, through, the, object, are, captured, behind, the, object, by, a, detector, either, photographic, film, or, a, digital, detector, the, generation, of, flat, two, dimensional, images, by, this, technique, is, called, projectional, radiography, in, computed, tomography, ct, scanning, an, x, ray, source, and, its, associated, detectors, rotate, around, the, subject, which, itself, moves, through, the, conical, x, ray, beam, produced, any, given, point, within, the, subject, is, crossed, from, many, directions, by, many, different, beams, at, different, times, information, regarding, the, attenuation, of, these, beams, is, collated, and, subjected, to, computation, to, generate, two, dimensional, images, on, three, planes, axial, coronal, and, sagittal, which, can, be, further, processed, to, produce, a, three, dimensional, image, since, the, body, is, made, up, of, various, substances, with, differing, densities, ionising, and, non, ionising, radiation, can, be, used, to, reveal, the, internal, structure, of, the, body, on, an, image, receptor, by, highlighting, these, differences, using, attenuation, or, in, the, case, of, ionising, radiation, the, absorption, of, x, ray, photons, by, the, denser, substances, like, calcium, rich, bones, the, discipline, involving, the, study, of, anatomy, through, the, use, of, radiographic, images, is, known, as, radiographic, anatomy, medical, radiography, acquisition, is, generally, carried, out, by, radiographers, while, image, analysis, is, generally, done, by, radiologists, some, radiographers, also, specialise, in, image, interpretation, medical, radiography, includes, a, range, of, modalities, producing, many, different, types, of, image, each, of, which, has, a, different, clinical, application, the, creation, of, images, by, exposing, an, object, to, x, rays, or, other, high, energy, forms, of, electromagnetic, radiation, and, capturing, the, resulting, remnant, beam, or, shadow, as, a, latent, image, is, known, as, projection, radiography, the, shadow, may, be, converted, to, light, using, a, fluorescent, screen, which, is, then, captured, on, photographic, film, it, may, be, captured, by, a, phosphor, screen, to, be, read, later, by, a, laser, cr, or, it, may, directly, activate, a, matrix, of, solid, state, detectors, dr, similar, to, a, very, large, version, of, a, ccd, in, a, digital, camera, bone, and, some, organs, such, as, lungs, especially, lend, themselves, to, projection, radiography, it, is, a, relatively, low, cost, investigation, with, a, high, diagnostic, yield, the, difference, between, soft, and, hard, body, parts, stems, mostly, from, the, fact, that, carbon, has, a, very, low, x, ray, cross, section, compared, to, calcium, computed, tomography, or, ct, scan, previously, known, as, cat, scan, the, a, standing, for, axial, uses, ionizing, radiation, x, ray, radiation, in, conjunction, with, a, computer, to, create, images, of, both, soft, and, hard, tissues, these, images, look, as, though, the, patient, was, sliced, like, bread, thus, tomography, tomo, means, slice, though, ct, uses, a, higher, amount, of, ionizing, x, radiation, than, diagnostic, x, rays, both, utilising, x, ray, radiation, with, advances, in, technology, levels, of, ct, radiation, dose, and, scan, times, have, reduced, ct, exams, are, generally, short, most, lasting, only, as, long, as, a, breath, hold, contrast, agents, are, also, often, used, depending, on, the, tissues, needing, to, be, seen, radiographers, perform, these, examinations, sometimes, in, conjunction, with, a, radiologist, for, instance, when, a, radiologist, performs, a, ct, guided, biopsy, dexa, or, bone, densitometry, is, used, primarily, for, osteoporosis, tests, it, is, not, projection, radiography, as, the, x, rays, are, emitted, in, two, narrow, beams, that, are, scanned, across, the, patient, 90, degrees, from, each, other, usually, the, hip, head, of, the, femur, lower, back, lumbar, spine, or, heel, calcaneum, are, imaged, and, the, bone, density, amount, of, calcium, is, determined, and, given, a, number, a, t, score, it, is, not, used, for, bone, imaging, as, the, image, quality, is, not, good, enough, to, make, an, accurate, diagnostic, image, for, fractures, inflammation, etc, it, can, also, be, used, to, measure, total, body, fat, though, this, is, not, common, the, radiation, dose, received, from, dexa, scans, is, very, low, much, lower, than, projection, radiography, examinations, fluoroscopy, is, a, term, invented, by, thomas, edison, during, his, early, x, ray, studies, the, name, refers, to, the, fluorescence, he, saw, while, looking, at, a, glowing, plate, bombarded, with, x, rays, the, technique, provides, moving, projection, radiographs, fluoroscopy, is, mainly, performed, to, view, movement, of, tissue, or, a, contrast, agent, or, to, guide, a, medical, intervention, such, as, angioplasty, pacemaker, insertion, or, joint, repair, replacement, the, last, can, often, be, carried, out, in, the, operating, theatre, using, a, portable, fluoroscopy, machine, called, a, c, arm, it, can, move, around, the, surgery, table, and, make, digital, images, for, the, surgeon, biplanar, fluoroscopy, works, the, same, as, single, plane, fluoroscopy, except, displaying, two, planes, at, the, same, time, the, ability, to, work, in, two, planes, is, important, for, orthopedic, and, spinal, surgery, and, can, reduce, operating, times, by, eliminating, re, positioning, angiography, is, the, use, of, fluoroscopy, to, view, the, cardiovascular, system, an, iodine, based, contrast, is, injected, into, the, bloodstream, and, watched, as, it, travels, around, since, liquid, blood, and, the, vessels, are, not, very, dense, a, contrast, with, high, density, like, the, large, iodine, atoms, is, used, to, view, the, vessels, under, x, ray, angiography, is, used, to, find, aneurysms, leaks, blockages, thromboses, new, vessel, growth, and, placement, of, catheters, and, stents, balloon, angioplasty, is, often, done, with, angiography, contrast, radiography, uses, a, radiocontrast, agent, a, type, of, contrast, medium, to, make, the, structures, of, interest, stand, out, visually, from, their, background, contrast, agents, are, required, in, conventional, angiography, and, can, be, used, in, both, projectional, radiography, and, computed, tomography, called, contrast, ct, although, not, technically, radiographic, techniques, due, to, not, using, x, rays, imaging, modalities, such, as, pet, and, mri, are, sometimes, grouped, in, radiography, because, the, radiology, department, of, hospitals, handle, all, forms, of, imaging, treatment, using, radiation, is, known, as, radiotherapy, industrial, radiography, is, a, method, of, non, destructive, testing, where, many, types, of, manufactured, components, can, be, examined, to, verify, the, internal, structure, and, integrity, of, the, specimen, industrial, radiography, can, be, performed, utilizing, either, x, rays, or, gamma, rays, both, are, forms, of, electromagnetic, radiation, the, difference, between, various, forms, of, electromagnetic, energy, is, related, to, the, wavelength, x, and, gamma, rays, have, the, shortest, wavelength, and, this, property, leads, to, the, ability, to, penetrate, travel, through, and, exit, various, materials, such, as, carbon, steel, and, other, metals, specific, methods, include, industrial, computed, tomography, image, quality, will, depend, on, resolution, and, density, resolution, is, the, ability, an, image, to, show, closely, spaced, structure, in, the, object, as, separate, entities, in, the, image, while, density, is, the, blackening, power, of, the, image, sharpness, of, a, radiographic, image, is, strongly, determined, by, the, size, of, the, x, ray, source, this, is, determined, by, the, area, of, the, electron, beam, hitting, the, anode, a, large, photon, source, results, in, more, blurring, in, the, final, image, and, is, worsened, by, an, increase, in, image, formation, distance, this, blurring, can, be, measured, as, a, contribution, to, the, modulation, transfer, function, of, the, imaging, system, the, dosage, of, radiation, applied, in, radiography, varies, by, procedure, for, example, the, effective, dosage, of, a, chest, x, ray, is, 0, 1, msv, while, an, abdominal, ct, is, 10, msv, the, american, association, of, physicists, in, medicine, aapm, have, stated, that, the, risks, of, medical, imaging, at, patient, doses, below, 50, msv, for, single, procedures, or, 100, msv, for, multiple, procedures, over, short, time, periods, are, too, low, to, be, detectable, and, may, be, nonexistent, other, scientific, bodies, sharing, this, conclusion, include, the, international, organization, of, medical, physicists, the, un, scientific, committee, on, the, effects, of, atomic, radiation, and, the, international, commission, on, radiological, protection, nonetheless, radiological, organizations, including, the, radiological, society, of, north, america, rsna, and, the, american, college, of, radiology, acr, as, well, as, multiple, government, agencies, indicate, safety, standards, to, ensure, that, radiation, dosage, is, as, low, as, possible, lead, is, the, most, common, shield, against, x, rays, because, of, its, high, density, 11, 340, kg, m, 3, stopping, power, ease, of, installation, and, low, cost, the, maximum, range, of, a, high, energy, photon, such, as, an, x, ray, in, matter, is, infinite, at, every, point, in, the, matter, traversed, by, the, photon, there, is, a, probability, of, interaction, thus, there, is, a, very, small, probability, of, no, interaction, over, very, large, distances, the, shielding, of, photon, beam, is, therefore, exponential, with, an, attenuation, length, being, close, to, the, radiation, length, of, the, material, doubling, the, thickness, of, shielding, will, square, the, shielding, effect, table, in, this, section, shows, the, recommended, thickness, of, lead, shielding, in, function, of, x, ray, energy, from, the, recommendations, by, the, second, international, congress, of, radiology, in, response, to, increased, concern, by, the, public, over, radiation, doses, and, the, ongoing, progress, of, best, practices, the, alliance, for, radiation, safety, in, pediatric, imaging, was, formed, within, the, society, for, pediatric, radiology, in, concert, with, the, american, society, of, radiologic, technologists, the, american, college, of, radiology, and, the, american, association, of, physicists, in, medicine, the, society, for, pediatric, radiology, developed, and, launched, the, image, gently, campaign, which, is, designed, to, maintain, high, quality, imaging, studies, while, using, the, lowest, doses, and, best, radiation, safety, practices, available, on, pediatric, patients, this, initiative, has, been, endorsed, and, applied, by, a, growing, list, of, various, professional, medical, organizations, around, the, world, and, has, received, support, and, assistance, from, companies, that, manufacture, equipment, used, in, radiology, following, upon, the, success, of, the, image, gently, campaign, the, american, college, of, radiology, the, radiological, society, of, north, america, the, american, association, of, physicists, in, medicine, and, the, american, society, of, radiologic, technologists, have, launched, a, similar, campaign, to, address, this, issue, in, the, adult, population, called, image, wisely, the, world, health, organization, and, international, atomic, energy, agency, iaea, of, the, united, nations, have, also, been, working, in, this, area, and, have, ongoing, projects, designed, to, broaden, best, practices, and, lower, patient, radiation, dose, contrary, to, advice, that, emphasises, only, conducting, radiographs, when, in, the, patient, s, interest, recent, evidence, suggests, that, they, are, used, more, frequently, when, dentists, are, paid, under, fee, for, service, in, medicine, and, dentistry, projectional, radiography, and, computed, tomography, images, generally, use, x, rays, created, by, x, ray, generators, which, generate, x, rays, from, x, ray, tubes, the, resultant, images, from, the, radiograph, x, ray, generator, machine, or, ct, scanner, are, correctly, referred, to, as, radiograms, roentgenograms, and, tomograms, respectively, a, number, of, other, sources, of, x, ray, photons, are, possible, and, may, be, used, in, industrial, radiography, or, research, these, include, betatrons, linear, accelerators, linacs, and, synchrotrons, for, gamma, rays, radioactive, sources, such, as, 192, ir, 60, co, or, 137, cs, are, used, an, anti, scatter, grid, may, be, placed, between, the, patient, and, the, detector, to, reduce, the, quantity, of, scattered, x, rays, that, reach, the, detector, this, improves, the, contrast, resolution, of, the, image, but, also, increases, radiation, exposure, for, the, patient, detectors, can, be, divided, into, two, major, categories, imaging, detectors, such, as, photographic, plates, and, x, ray, film, photographic, film, now, mostly, replaced, by, various, digitizing, devices, like, image, plates, or, flat, panel, detectors, and, dose, measurement, devices, such, as, ionization, chambers, geiger, counters, and, dosimeters, used, to, measure, the, local, radiation, exposure, dose, and, or, dose, rate, for, example, for, verifying, that, radiation, protection, equipment, and, procedures, are, effective, on, an, ongoing, basis, a, radiopaque, anatomical, side, marker, is, added, to, each, image, for, example, if, the, patient, has, their, right, hand, x, rayed, the, radiographer, includes, a, radiopaque, r, marker, within, the, field, of, the, x, ray, beam, as, an, indicator, of, which, hand, has, been, imaged, if, a, physical, marker, is, not, included, the, radiographer, may, add, the, correct, side, marker, later, as, part, of, digital, post, processing, as, an, alternative, to, x, ray, detectors, image, intensifiers, are, analog, devices, that, readily, convert, the, acquired, x, ray, image, into, one, visible, on, a, video, screen, this, device, is, made, of, a, vacuum, tube, with, a, wide, input, surface, coated, on, the, inside, with, caesium, iodide, csi, when, hit, by, x, rays, material, phosphors, which, causes, the, photocathode, adjacent, to, it, to, emit, electrons, these, electrons, are, then, focused, using, electron, lenses, inside, the, intensifier, to, an, output, screen, coated, with, phosphorescent, materials, the, image, from, the, output, can, then, be, recorded, via, a, camera, and, displayed, digital, devices, known, as, array, detectors, are, becoming, more, common, in, fluoroscopy, these, devices, are, made, of, discrete, pixelated, detectors, known, as, thin, film, transistors, tft, which, can, either, work, indirectly, by, using, photo, detectors, that, detect, light, emitted, from, a, scintillator, material, such, as, csi, or, directly, by, capturing, the, electrons, produced, when, the, x, rays, hit, the, detector, direct, detectors, do, not, tend, to, experience, the, blurring, or, spreading, effect, caused, by, phosphorescent, scintillators, or, by, film, screens, since, the, detectors, are, activated, directly, by, x, ray, photons, dual, energy, radiography, is, where, images, are, acquired, using, two, separate, tube, voltages, this, is, the, standard, method, for, bone, densitometry, it, is, also, used, in, ct, pulmonary, angiography, to, decrease, the, required, dose, of, iodinated, contrast, radiography, s, origins, and, fluoroscopy, s, origins, can, both, be, traced, to, 8, november, 1895, when, german, physics, professor, wilhelm, conrad, r, ntgen, discovered, the, x, ray, and, noted, that, while, it, could, pass, through, human, tissue, it, could, not, pass, through, bone, or, metal, r, ntgen, referred, to, the, radiation, as, x, to, indicate, that, it, was, an, unknown, type, of, radiation, he, received, the, first, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, discovery, there, are, conflicting, accounts, of, his, discovery, because, r, ntgen, had, his, lab, notes, burned, after, his, death, but, this, is, a, likely, reconstruction, by, his, biographers, r, ntgen, was, investigating, cathode, rays, using, a, fluorescent, screen, painted, with, barium, platinocyanide, and, a, crookes, tube, which, he, had, wrapped, in, black, cardboard, to, shield, its, fluorescent, glow, he, noticed, a, faint, green, glow, from, the, screen, about, 1, metre, away, r, ntgen, realized, some, invisible, rays, coming, from, the, tube, were, passing, through, the, cardboard, to, make, the, screen, glow, they, were, passing, through, an, opaque, object, to, affect, the, film, behind, it, r, ntgen, discovered, x, rays, medical, use, when, he, made, a, picture, of, his, wife, s, hand, on, a, photographic, plate, formed, due, to, x, rays, the, photograph, of, his, wife, s, hand, was, the, first, ever, photograph, of, a, human, body, part, using, x, rays, when, she, saw, the, picture, she, said, i, have, seen, my, death, the, first, use, of, x, rays, under, clinical, conditions, was, by, john, hall, edwards, in, birmingham, england, on, 11, january, 1896, when, he, radiographed, a, needle, stuck, in, the, hand, of, an, associate, on, 14, february, 1896, hall, edwards, also, became, the, first, to, use, x, rays, in, a, surgical, operation, the, united, states, saw, its, first, medical, x, ray, obtained, using, a, discharge, tube, of, ivan, pulyui, s, design, in, january, 1896, on, reading, of, r, ntgen, s, discovery, frank, austin, of, dartmouth, college, tested, all, of, the, discharge, tubes, in, the, physics, laboratory, and, found, that, only, the, pulyui, tube, produced, x, rays, this, was, a, result, of, pulyui, s, inclusion, of, an, oblique, target, of, mica, used, for, holding, samples, of, fluorescent, material, within, the, tube, on, 3, february, 1896, gilman, frost, professor, of, medicine, at, the, college, and, his, brother, edwin, frost, professor, of, physics, exposed, the, wrist, of, eddie, mccarthy, whom, gilman, had, treated, some, weeks, earlier, for, a, fracture, to, the, x, rays, and, collected, the, resulting, image, of, the, broken, bone, on, gelatin, photographic, plates, obtained, from, howard, langill, a, local, photographer, also, interested, in, r, ntgen, s, work, x, rays, were, put, to, diagnostic, use, very, early, for, example, alan, archibald, campbell, swinton, opened, a, radiographic, laboratory, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1896, before, the, dangers, of, ionizing, radiation, were, discovered, indeed, marie, curie, pushed, for, radiography, to, be, used, to, treat, wounded, soldiers, in, world, war, i, initially, many, kinds, of, staff, conducted, radiography, in, hospitals, including, physicists, photographers, physicians, nurses, and, engineers, the, medical, speciality, of, radiology, grew, up, over, many, years, around, the, new, technology, when, new, diagnostic, tests, were, developed, it, was, natural, for, the, radiographers, to, be, trained, in, and, to, adopt, this, new, technology, radiographers, now, perform, fluoroscopy, computed, tomography, mammography, ultrasound, nuclear, medicine, and, magnetic, resonance, imaging, as, well, although, a, nonspecialist, dictionary, might, define, radiography, quite, narrowly, as, taking, x, ray, images, this, has, long, been, only, part, of, the, work, of, x, ray, departments, radiographers, and, radiologists, initially, radiographs, were, known, as, roentgenograms, while, skiagrapher, from, the, ancient, greek, words, for, shadow, and, writer, was, used, until, about, 1918, to, mean, radiographer, the, japanese, term, for, the, radiograph, rentogen, shares, its, etymology, with, the, original, english, term
