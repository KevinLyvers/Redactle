a, pipe, is, a, tubular, section, or, hollow, cylinder, usually, but, not, necessarily, of, circular, cross, section, used, mainly, to, convey, substances, which, can, flow, liquids, and, gases, fluids, slurries, powders, and, masses, of, small, solids, it, can, also, be, used, for, structural, applications, hollow, pipe, is, far, stiffer, per, unit, weight, than, solid, members, in, common, usage, the, words, pipe, and, tube, are, usually, interchangeable, but, in, industry, and, engineering, the, terms, are, uniquely, defined, depending, on, the, applicable, standard, to, which, it, is, manufactured, pipe, is, generally, specified, by, a, nominal, diameter, with, a, constant, outside, diameter, od, and, a, schedule, that, defines, the, thickness, tube, is, most, often, specified, by, the, od, and, wall, thickness, but, may, be, specified, by, any, two, of, od, inside, diameter, id, and, wall, thickness, pipe, is, generally, manufactured, to, one, of, several, international, and, national, industrial, standards, while, similar, standards, exist, for, specific, industry, application, tubing, tube, is, often, made, to, custom, sizes, and, a, broader, range, of, diameters, and, tolerances, many, industrial, and, government, standards, exist, for, the, production, of, pipe, and, tubing, the, term, tube, is, also, commonly, applied, to, non, cylindrical, sections, i, e, square, or, rectangular, tubing, in, general, pipe, is, the, more, common, term, in, most, of, the, world, whereas, tube, is, more, widely, used, in, the, united, states, both, pipe, and, tube, imply, a, level, of, rigidity, and, permanence, whereas, a, hose, or, hosepipe, is, usually, portable, and, flexible, pipe, assemblies, are, almost, always, constructed, with, the, use, of, fittings, such, as, elbows, tees, and, so, on, while, tube, may, be, formed, or, bent, into, custom, configurations, for, materials, that, are, inflexible, cannot, be, formed, or, where, construction, is, governed, by, codes, or, standards, tube, assemblies, are, also, constructed, with, the, use, of, tube, fittings, additionally, pipes, are, used, for, many, purposes, that, do, not, involve, conveying, fluid, handrails, scaffolding, and, support, structures, are, often, constructed, from, structural, pipes, especially, in, an, industrial, environment, the, first, known, use, of, pipes, was, in, ancient, egypt, the, pyramid, of, sahure, completed, around, the, 25th, century, bc, included, a, temple, with, an, elaborate, drainage, system, including, more, than, 380, m, 1, 247, ft, of, copper, piping, during, the, napoleonic, wars, birmingham, gunmakers, tried, to, use, rolling, mills, to, make, iron, musket, barrels, one, of, them, henry, osborne, developed, a, relatively, effective, process, in, 1817, with, which, he, started, to, make, iron, gas, tubes, ca, 1820, selling, some, to, gas, lighting, pioneer, samuel, clegg, when, steel, pipes, were, introduced, in, 19th, century, they, initially, were, riveted, and, later, clamped, with, h, shaped, bars, even, though, methods, for, making, weldless, steel, tubes, were, known, already, in, the, 1870s, until, by, the, early, 1930s, these, methods, were, replaced, by, welding, which, is, still, widely, used, today, there, are, three, processes, for, metallic, pipe, manufacture, centrifugal, casting, of, hot, alloyed, metal, is, one, of, the, most, prominent, process, ductile, iron, pipes, are, generally, manufactured, in, such, a, fashion, seamless, pipe, smls, is, formed, by, drawing, a, solid, billet, over, a, piercing, rod, to, create, the, hollow, shell, in, a, process, called, rotary, piercing, as, the, manufacturing, process, does, not, include, any, welding, seamless, pipes, are, perceived, to, be, stronger, and, more, reliable, historically, seamless, pipe, was, regarded, as, withstanding, pressure, better, than, other, types, and, was, often, more, available, than, welded, pipe, advances, since, the, 1970s, in, materials, process, control, and, non, destructive, testing, allow, correctly, specified, welded, pipe, to, replace, seamless, in, many, applications, welded, pipe, is, formed, by, rolling, plate, and, welding, the, seam, usually, by, electric, resistance, welding, erw, or, electric, fusion, welding, efw, the, weld, flash, can, be, removed, from, both, inner, and, outer, surfaces, using, a, scarfing, blade, the, weld, zone, can, also, be, heat, treated, to, make, the, seam, less, visible, welded, pipe, often, has, tighter, dimensional, tolerances, than, the, seamless, type, and, can, be, cheaper, to, manufacture, there, are, a, number, of, processes, that, may, be, used, to, produce, erw, pipes, each, of, these, processes, leads, to, coalescence, or, merging, of, steel, components, into, pipes, electric, current, is, passed, through, the, surfaces, that, have, to, be, welded, together, as, the, components, being, welded, together, resist, the, electric, current, heat, is, generated, which, forms, the, weld, pools, of, molten, metal, are, formed, where, the, two, surfaces, are, connected, as, a, strong, electric, current, is, passed, through, the, metal, these, pools, of, molten, metal, form, the, weld, that, binds, the, two, abutted, components, erw, pipes, are, manufactured, from, the, longitudinal, welding, of, steel, the, welding, process, for, erw, pipes, is, continuous, as, opposed, to, welding, of, distinct, sections, at, intervals, erw, process, uses, steel, coil, as, feedstock, the, high, frequency, induction, technology, hfi, welding, process, is, used, for, manufacturing, erw, pipes, in, this, process, the, current, to, weld, the, pipe, is, applied, by, means, of, an, induction, coil, around, the, tube, hfi, is, generally, considered, to, be, technically, superior, to, ordinary, erw, when, manufacturing, pipes, for, critical, applications, such, as, for, usage, in, the, energy, sector, in, addition, to, other, uses, in, line, pipe, applications, as, well, as, for, casing, and, tubing, large, diameter, pipe, 25, centimetres, 10, in, or, greater, may, be, erw, efw, or, submerged, arc, welded, saw, pipe, there, are, two, technologies, that, can, be, used, to, manufacture, steel, pipes, of, sizes, larger, than, the, steel, pipes, that, can, be, produced, by, seamless, and, erw, processes, the, two, types, of, pipes, produced, through, these, technologies, are, longitudinal, submerged, arc, welded, lsaw, and, spiral, submerged, arc, welded, ssaw, pipes, lsaw, are, made, by, bending, and, welding, wide, steel, plates, and, most, commonly, used, in, oil, and, gas, industry, applications, due, to, their, high, cost, lsaw, pipes, are, seldom, used, in, lower, value, non, energy, applications, such, as, water, pipelines, ssaw, pipes, are, produced, by, spiral, helicoidal, welding, of, steel, coil, and, have, a, cost, advantage, over, lsaw, pipes, as, the, process, uses, coils, rather, than, steel, plates, as, such, in, applications, where, spiral, weld, is, acceptable, ssaw, pipes, may, be, preferred, over, lsaw, pipes, both, lsaw, pipes, and, ssaw, pipes, compete, against, erw, pipes, and, seamless, pipes, in, the, diameter, ranges, of, 16, 24, tubing, for, flow, either, metal, or, plastic, is, generally, extruded, pipe, is, made, out, of, many, types, of, material, including, ceramic, glass, fiberglass, many, metals, concrete, and, plastic, in, the, past, wood, and, lead, latin, plumbum, from, which, comes, the, word, plumbing, were, commonly, used, typically, metallic, piping, is, made, of, steel, or, iron, such, as, unfinished, black, lacquer, steel, carbon, steel, stainless, steel, galvanized, steel, brass, and, ductile, iron, iron, based, piping, is, subject, to, corrosion, if, used, within, a, highly, oxygenated, water, stream, aluminum, pipe, or, tubing, may, be, utilized, where, iron, is, incompatible, with, the, service, fluid, or, where, weight, is, a, concern, aluminum, is, also, used, for, heat, transfer, tubing, such, as, in, refrigerant, systems, copper, tubing, is, popular, for, domestic, water, potable, plumbing, systems, copper, may, be, used, where, heat, transfer, is, desirable, i, e, radiators, or, heat, exchangers, inconel, chrome, moly, and, titanium, steel, alloys, are, used, in, high, temperature, and, pressure, piping, in, process, and, power, facilities, when, specifying, alloys, for, new, processes, the, known, issues, of, creep, and, sensitization, effect, must, be, taken, into, account, lead, piping, is, still, found, in, old, domestic, and, other, water, distribution, systems, but, is, no, longer, permitted, for, new, potable, water, piping, installations, due, to, its, toxicity, many, building, codes, now, require, that, lead, piping, in, residential, or, institutional, installations, be, replaced, with, non, toxic, piping, or, that, the, tubes, interiors, be, treated, with, phosphoric, acid, according, to, a, senior, researcher, and, lead, expert, with, the, canadian, environmental, law, association, there, is, no, safe, level, of, lead, in, 1991, the, us, epa, issued, the, lead, and, copper, rule, a, federal, regulation, which, limits, the, concentration, of, lead, and, copper, allowed, in, public, drinking, water, as, well, as, the, permissible, amount, of, pipe, corrosion, occurring, due, to, the, water, itself, in, the, us, it, is, estimated, that, 6, 5, million, lead, service, lines, pipes, that, connect, water, mains, to, home, plumbing, installed, before, the, 1930s, are, still, in, use, plastic, tubing, is, widely, used, for, its, light, weight, chemical, resistance, non, corrosive, properties, and, ease, of, making, connections, plastic, materials, include, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, chlorinated, polyvinyl, chloride, cpvc, fibre, reinforced, plastic, frp, reinforced, polymer, mortar, rpmp, polypropylene, pp, polyethylene, pe, cross, linked, high, density, polyethylene, pex, polybutylene, pb, and, acrylonitrile, butadiene, styrene, abs, for, example, in, many, countries, pvc, pipes, account, for, most, pipe, materials, used, in, buried, municipal, applications, for, drinking, water, distribution, and, wastewater, mains, pipe, may, be, made, from, concrete, or, ceramic, usually, for, low, pressure, applications, such, as, gravity, flow, or, drainage, pipes, for, sewage, are, still, predominantly, made, from, concrete, or, vitrified, clay, reinforced, concrete, can, be, used, for, large, diameter, concrete, pipes, this, pipe, material, can, be, used, in, many, types, of, construction, and, is, often, used, in, the, gravity, flow, transport, of, storm, water, usually, such, pipe, will, have, a, receiving, bell, or, a, stepped, fitting, with, various, sealing, methods, applied, at, installation, when, the, alloys, for, piping, are, forged, metallurgical, tests, are, performed, to, determine, material, composition, by, of, each, chemical, element, in, the, piping, and, the, results, are, recorded, in, a, material, test, report, also, known, as, a, mill, test, report, mtr, these, tests, can, be, used, to, prove, that, the, alloy, conforms, to, various, specifications, e, g, 316, ss, the, tests, are, stamped, by, the, mill, s, qa, qc, department, and, can, be, used, to, trace, the, material, back, to, the, mill, by, future, users, such, as, piping, and, fitting, manufacturers, maintaining, the, traceability, between, the, alloy, material, and, associated, mtr, is, an, important, quality, assurance, issue, qa, often, requires, the, heat, number, to, be, written, on, the, pipe, precautions, must, also, be, taken, to, prevent, the, introduction, of, counterfeit, materials, as, a, backup, to, etching, labeling, of, the, material, identification, on, the, pipe, positive, material, identification, pmi, is, performed, using, a, handheld, device, the, device, scans, the, pipe, material, using, an, emitted, electromagnetic, wave, x, ray, fluorescence, xrf, and, receives, a, reply, that, is, spectrographically, analyzed, pipe, sizes, can, be, confusing, because, the, terminology, may, relate, to, historical, dimensions, for, example, a, half, inch, iron, pipe, does, not, have, any, dimension, that, is, a, half, inch, initially, a, half, inch, pipe, did, have, an, inner, diameter, of, 1, 2, inch, 13, mm, but, it, also, had, thick, walls, as, technology, improved, thinner, walls, became, possible, but, the, outside, diameter, stayed, the, same, so, it, could, mate, with, existing, older, pipe, increasing, the, inner, diameter, beyond, half, an, inch, the, history, of, copper, pipe, is, similar, in, the, 1930s, the, pipe, was, designated, by, its, internal, diameter, and, a, 1, 16, inch, 1, 6, mm, wall, thickness, consequently, a, 1, inch, 25, mm, copper, pipe, had, a, 1, 1, 8, inch, 28, 58, mm, outside, diameter, the, outside, diameter, was, the, important, dimension, for, mating, with, fittings, the, wall, thickness, on, modern, copper, is, usually, thinner, than, 1, 16, inch, 1, 6, mm, so, the, internal, diameter, is, only, nominal, rather, than, a, controlling, dimension, newer, pipe, technologies, sometimes, adopted, a, sizing, system, as, its, own, pvc, pipe, uses, the, nominal, pipe, size, pipe, sizes, are, specified, by, a, number, of, national, and, international, standards, including, api, 5l, ansi, asme, b36, 10m, and, b36, 19m, in, the, us, bs, 1600, and, bs, en, 10255, in, the, united, kingdom, and, europe, there, are, two, common, methods, for, designating, pipe, outside, diameter, od, the, north, american, method, is, called, nps, nominal, pipe, size, and, is, based, on, inches, also, frequently, referred, to, as, nb, nominal, bore, the, european, version, is, called, dn, diametre, nominal, nominal, diameter, and, is, based, on, millimetres, designating, the, outside, diameter, allows, pipes, of, the, same, size, to, be, fit, together, no, matter, what, the, wall, thickness, since, the, outside, diameter, is, fixed, for, a, given, pipe, size, the, inside, diameter, will, vary, depending, on, the, wall, thickness, of, the, pipe, for, example, 2, schedule, 80, pipe, has, thicker, walls, and, therefore, a, smaller, inside, diameter, than, 2, schedule, 40, pipe, steel, pipe, has, been, produced, for, about, 150, years, the, pipe, sizes, that, are, in, use, today, in, pvc, and, galvanized, were, originally, designed, years, ago, for, steel, pipe, the, number, system, like, sch, 40, 80, 160, were, set, long, ago, and, seem, a, little, odd, for, example, sch, 20, pipe, is, even, thinner, than, sch, 40, but, same, od, and, while, these, pipes, are, based, on, old, steel, pipe, sizes, there, is, other, pipe, like, cpvc, for, heated, water, that, uses, pipe, sizes, inside, and, out, based, on, old, copper, pipe, size, standards, instead, of, steel, many, different, standards, exist, for, pipe, sizes, and, their, prevalence, varies, depending, on, industry, and, geographical, area, the, pipe, size, designation, generally, includes, two, numbers, one, that, indicates, the, outside, od, or, nominal, diameter, and, the, other, that, indicates, the, wall, thickness, in, the, early, twentieth, century, american, pipe, was, sized, by, inside, diameter, this, practice, was, abandoned, to, improve, compatibility, with, pipe, fittings, that, must, usually, fit, the, od, of, the, pipe, but, it, has, had, a, lasting, impact, on, modern, standards, around, the, world, in, north, america, and, the, uk, pressure, piping, is, usually, specified, by, nominal, pipe, size, nps, and, schedule, sch, pipe, sizes, are, documented, by, a, number, of, standards, including, api, 5l, ansi, asme, b36, 10m, table, 1, in, the, us, and, bs, 1600, and, bs, 1387, in, the, united, kingdom, typically, the, pipe, wall, thickness, is, the, controlled, variable, and, the, inside, diameter, i, d, is, allowed, to, vary, the, pipe, wall, thickness, has, a, variance, of, approximately, 12, 5, percent, in, the, rest, of, europe, pressure, piping, uses, the, same, pipe, ids, and, wall, thicknesses, as, nominal, pipe, size, but, labels, them, with, a, metric, diameter, nominal, dn, instead, of, the, imperial, nps, for, nps, larger, than, 14, the, dn, is, equal, to, the, nps, multiplied, by, 25, not, 25, 4, this, is, documented, by, en, 10255, formerly, din, 2448, and, bs, 1387, and, iso, 65, 1981, and, it, is, often, called, din, or, iso, pipe, japan, has, its, own, set, of, standard, pipe, sizes, often, called, jis, pipe, the, iron, pipe, size, ips, is, an, older, system, still, used, by, some, manufacturers, and, legacy, drawings, and, equipment, the, ips, number, is, the, same, as, the, nps, number, but, the, schedules, were, limited, to, standard, wall, std, extra, strong, xs, and, double, extra, strong, xxs, std, is, identical, to, sch, 40, for, nps, 1, 8, to, nps, 10, inclusive, and, indicates, 375, wall, thickness, for, nps, 12, and, larger, xs, is, identical, to, sch, 80, for, nps, 1, 8, to, nps, 8, inclusive, and, indicates, 500, wall, thickness, for, nps, 8, and, larger, different, definitions, exist, for, xxs, however, it, is, never, the, same, as, sch, 160, xxs, is, in, fact, thicker, than, sch, 160, for, nps, 1, 8, to, 6, inclusive, whereas, sch, 160, is, thicker, than, xxs, for, nps, 8, and, larger, another, old, system, is, the, ductile, iron, pipe, size, dips, which, generally, has, larger, ods, than, ips, copper, plumbing, tube, for, residential, plumbing, follows, an, entirely, different, size, system, in, america, often, called, copper, tube, size, cts, see, domestic, water, system, its, nominal, size, is, neither, the, inside, nor, outside, diameter, plastic, tubing, such, as, pvc, and, cpvc, for, plumbing, applications, also, has, different, sizing, standards, agricultural, applications, use, pip, sizes, which, stands, for, plastic, irrigation, pipe, pip, comes, in, pressure, ratings, of, 22, psi, 150, kpa, 50, psi, 340, kpa, 80, psi, 550, kpa, 100, psi, 690, kpa, and, 125, psi, 860, kpa, and, is, generally, available, in, diameters, of, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 21, and, 24, inches, 15, 20, 25, 30, 38, 46, 53, and, 61, cm, the, manufacture, and, installation, of, pressure, piping, is, tightly, regulated, by, the, asme, b31, code, series, such, as, b31, 1, or, b31, 3, which, have, their, basis, in, the, asme, boiler, and, pressure, vessel, code, bpvc, this, code, has, the, force, of, law, in, canada, and, the, us, europe, and, the, rest, of, the, world, has, an, equivalent, system, of, codes, pressure, piping, is, generally, pipe, that, must, carry, pressures, greater, than, 10, to, 25, atmospheres, although, definitions, vary, to, ensure, safe, operation, of, the, system, the, manufacture, storage, welding, testing, etc, of, pressure, piping, must, meet, stringent, quality, standards, manufacturing, standards, for, pipes, commonly, require, a, test, of, chemical, composition, and, a, series, of, mechanical, strength, tests, for, each, heat, of, pipe, a, heat, of, pipe, is, all, forged, from, the, same, cast, ingot, and, therefore, had, the, same, chemical, composition, mechanical, tests, may, be, associated, to, a, lot, of, pipe, which, would, be, all, from, the, same, heat, and, have, been, through, the, same, heat, treatment, processes, the, manufacturer, performs, these, tests, and, reports, the, composition, in, a, mill, traceability, report, and, the, mechanical, tests, in, a, material, test, report, both, of, which, are, referred, to, by, the, acronym, mtr, material, with, these, associated, test, reports, is, called, traceable, for, critical, applications, third, party, verification, of, these, tests, may, be, required, in, this, case, an, independent, lab, will, produce, a, certified, material, test, report, cmtr, and, the, material, will, be, called, certified, some, widely, used, pipe, standards, or, piping, classes, are, api, 5l, was, changed, in, the, second, half, of, 2008, to, edition, 44, from, edition, 43, to, make, it, identical, to, iso, 3183, it, is, important, to, note, that, the, change, has, created, the, requirement, that, sour, service, erw, pipe, pass, a, hydrogen, induced, cracking, hic, test, per, nace, tm0284, in, order, to, be, used, for, sour, service, pipe, installation, is, often, more, expensive, than, the, material, and, a, variety, of, specialized, tools, techniques, and, parts, have, been, developed, to, assist, this, pipe, is, usually, delivered, to, a, customer, or, jobsite, as, either, sticks, or, lengths, of, pipe, typically, 20, feet, 6, 1, m, called, single, random, length, or, they, are, prefabricated, with, elbows, tees, and, valves, into, a, prefabricated, pipe, spool, typically, pipe, smaller, than, 2, inches, 5, 1, cm, are, not, pre, fabricated, the, pipe, spools, are, usually, tagged, with, a, bar, code, and, the, ends, are, capped, plastic, for, protection, the, pipe, and, pipe, spools, are, delivered, to, a, warehouse, on, a, large, commercial, industrial, job, and, they, may, be, held, indoors, or, in, a, gridded, laydown, yard, the, pipe, or, pipe, spool, is, retrieved, staged, rigged, and, then, lifted, into, place, on, large, process, jobs, the, lift, is, made, using, cranes, and, hoist, and, other, material, lifts, they, are, typically, temporarily, supported, in, the, steel, structure, using, beam, clamps, straps, and, small, hoists, until, the, pipe, supports, are, attached, or, otherwise, secured, an, example, of, a, tool, used, for, installation, for, a, small, plumbing, pipe, threaded, ends, is, the, pipe, wrench, small, pipe, is, typically, not, heavy, and, can, be, lifted, into, place, by, the, installation, craft, laborer, however, during, a, plant, outage, or, shutdown, the, small, small, bore, pipe, may, also, be, pre, fabricated, to, expedite, installation, during, the, outage, after, the, pipe, is, installed, it, will, be, tested, for, leaks, before, testing, it, may, need, to, be, cleaned, by, blowing, air, or, steam, or, flushing, with, a, liquid, pipes, are, usually, either, supported, from, below, or, hung, from, above, but, may, also, be, supported, from, the, side, using, devices, called, pipe, supports, supports, may, be, as, simple, as, a, pipe, shoe, which, is, akin, to, a, half, of, an, i, beam, welded, to, the, bottom, of, the, pipe, they, may, be, hung, using, a, clevis, or, with, trapeze, type, of, devices, called, pipe, hangers, pipe, supports, of, any, kind, may, incorporate, springs, snubbers, dampers, or, combinations, of, these, devices, to, compensate, for, thermal, expansion, or, to, provide, vibration, isolation, shock, control, or, reduced, vibration, excitation, of, the, pipe, due, to, earthquake, motion, some, dampers, are, simply, fluid, dashpots, but, other, dampers, may, be, active, hydraulic, devices, that, have, sophisticated, systems, that, act, to, dampen, peak, displacements, due, to, externally, imposed, vibrations, or, mechanical, shocks, the, undesired, motions, may, be, process, derived, such, as, in, a, fluidized, bed, reactor, or, from, a, natural, phenomenon, such, as, an, earthquake, design, basis, event, or, dbe, pipe, hanger, assembles, are, usually, attached, with, pipe, clamps, possible, exposure, to, high, temperatures, and, heavy, loads, should, be, included, when, specifying, which, clamps, are, needed, pipes, are, commonly, joined, by, welding, using, threaded, pipe, and, fittings, sealing, the, connection, with, a, pipe, thread, compound, polytetrafluoroethylene, ptfe, thread, seal, tape, oakum, or, ptfe, string, or, by, using, a, mechanical, coupling, process, piping, is, usually, joined, by, welding, using, a, tig, or, mig, process, the, most, common, process, pipe, joint, is, the, butt, weld, the, ends, of, pipe, to, be, welded, must, have, a, certain, weld, preparation, called, an, end, weld, prep, ewp, which, is, typically, at, an, angle, of, 37, 5, degrees, to, accommodate, the, filler, weld, metal, the, most, common, pipe, thread, in, north, america, is, the, national, pipe, thread, npt, or, the, dryseal, nptf, version, other, pipe, threads, include, the, british, standard, pipe, thread, bspt, the, garden, hose, thread, ght, and, the, fire, hose, coupling, nst, copper, pipes, are, typically, joined, by, soldering, brazing, compression, fittings, flaring, or, crimping, plastic, pipes, may, be, joined, by, solvent, welding, heat, fusion, or, elastomeric, sealing, if, frequent, disconnection, will, be, required, gasketed, pipe, flanges, or, union, fittings, provide, better, reliability, than, threads, some, thin, walled, pipes, of, ductile, material, such, as, the, smaller, copper, or, flexible, plastic, water, pipes, found, in, homes, for, ice, makers, and, humidifiers, for, example, may, be, joined, with, compression, fittings, underground, pipe, typically, uses, a, push, on, gasket, style, of, pipe, that, compresses, a, gasket, into, a, space, formed, between, the, two, adjoining, pieces, push, on, joints, are, available, on, most, types, of, pipe, a, pipe, joint, lubricant, must, be, used, in, the, assembly, of, the, pipe, under, buried, conditions, gasket, joint, pipes, allow, for, lateral, movement, due, to, soil, shifting, as, well, as, expansion, contraction, due, to, temperature, differentials, plastic, mdpe, and, hdpe, gas, and, water, pipes, are, also, often, joined, with, electrofusion, fittings, large, above, ground, pipe, typically, uses, a, flanged, joint, which, is, generally, available, in, ductile, iron, pipe, and, some, others, it, is, a, gasket, style, where, the, flanges, of, the, adjoining, pipes, are, bolted, together, compressing, the, gasket, into, a, space, between, the, pipe, mechanical, grooved, couplings, or, victaulic, joints, are, also, frequently, used, for, frequent, disassembly, and, assembly, developed, in, the, 1920s, these, mechanical, grooved, couplings, can, operate, up, to, 120, pounds, per, square, inch, 830, kpa, working, pressures, and, available, in, materials, to, match, the, pipe, grade, another, type, of, mechanical, coupling, is, a, flareless, tube, fitting, major, brands, include, swagelok, ham, let, parker, this, type, of, compression, fitting, is, typically, used, on, small, tubing, under, 2, inches, 51, mm, in, diameter, when, pipes, join, in, chambers, where, other, components, are, needed, for, the, management, of, the, network, such, as, valves, or, gauges, dismantling, joints, are, generally, used, in, order, to, make, mounting, dismounting, easier, fittings, are, also, used, to, split, or, join, a, number, of, pipes, together, and, for, other, purposes, a, broad, variety, of, standardized, pipe, fittings, are, available, they, are, generally, broken, down, into, either, a, tee, an, elbow, a, branch, a, reducer, enlarger, or, a, wye, valves, control, fluid, flow, and, regulate, pressure, the, piping, and, plumbing, fittings, and, valves, articles, discuss, them, further, the, inside, of, pipes, can, be, cleaned, with, a, tube, cleaning, process, if, they, are, contaminated, with, debris, or, fouling, this, depends, on, the, process, that, the, pipe, will, be, used, for, and, the, cleanliness, needed, for, the, process, in, some, cases, the, pipes, are, cleaned, using, a, displacement, device, formally, known, as, a, pipeline, inspection, gauge, or, pig, alternately, the, pipes, or, tubes, may, be, chemically, flushed, using, specialized, solutions, that, are, pumped, through, in, some, cases, where, care, has, been, taken, in, the, manufacture, storage, and, installation, of, pipe, and, tubing, the, lines, are, blown, clean, with, compressed, air, or, nitrogen, pipe, is, widely, used, in, the, fabrication, of, handrails, guardrails, and, railings, steel, pipe, or, black, iron, pipe, was, once, the, most, popular, choice, for, supply, of, water, and, flammable, gases, steel, pipe, is, still, used, in, many, homes, and, businesses, to, convey, natural, gas, or, propane, fuel, and, is, a, popular, choice, in, fire, sprinkler, systems, due, to, its, high, heat, resistance, in, commercial, buildings, steel, pipe, is, used, to, convey, heating, or, cooling, water, to, heat, exchangers, air, handlers, variable, air, volume, vav, devices, or, other, hvac, equipment, steel, pipe, is, sometimes, joined, using, threaded, connections, where, tapered, threads, see, national, pipe, thread, are, cut, into, the, end, of, the, tubing, segment, sealant, is, applied, in, the, form, of, thread, sealing, compound, or, thread, seal, tape, also, known, as, ptfe, or, teflon, tape, and, it, is, then, threaded, into, a, corresponding, threaded, fitting, using, two, pipe, wrenches, beyond, domestic, or, light, commercial, settings, steel, pipe, is, often, joined, by, welding, or, by, use, of, mechanical, couplings, made, by, companies, such, as, victaulic, or, anvil, international, formerly, grinnell, that, hold, the, pipe, joint, together, via, a, groove, pressed, or, cut, a, rarely, used, older, practice, into, the, ends, of, the, pipes, other, variations, of, steel, pipe, include, various, stainless, steel, and, chrome, alloys, in, high, pressure, situations, these, are, usually, joined, by, tig, welding, in, canada, with, respect, to, natural, gas, ng, and, propane, lp, gas, black, iron, pipe, bip, is, commonly, used, to, connect, an, appliance, to, the, supply, it, must, however, be, marked, either, painted, yellow, or, yellow, banding, attached, at, certain, intervals, and, certain, restrictions, apply, to, which, nominal, pipe, size, nps, can, be, put, through, walls, and, buildings, with, propane, in, particular, bip, can, be, run, from, an, exterior, tank, or, cylinder, provided, it, is, well, protected, from, the, weather, and, an, anode, type, of, protection, from, corrosion, is, in, place, when, the, pipe, is, to, be, installed, underground, copper, tubing, is, most, often, used, for, supply, of, hot, and, cold, water, and, as, refrigerant, line, in, hvac, systems, there, are, two, basic, types, of, copper, tubing, soft, copper, and, rigid, copper, copper, tubing, is, joined, using, flare, connection, compression, connection, or, solder, copper, offers, a, high, level, of, resistance, to, corrosion, but, is, becoming, very, costly, soft, or, ductile, copper, tubing, can, be, bent, easily, to, travel, around, obstacles, in, the, path, of, the, tubing, while, the, work, hardening, of, the, drawing, process, used, to, size, the, tubing, makes, the, copper, hard, rigid, it, is, carefully, annealed, to, make, it, soft, again, it, is, therefore, more, expensive, to, produce, than, non, annealed, rigid, copper, tubing, it, can, be, joined, by, any, of, the, three, methods, used, for, rigid, copper, and, it, is, the, only, type, of, copper, tubing, suitable, for, flare, connections, soft, copper, is, the, most, popular, choice, for, refrigerant, lines, in, split, system, air, conditioners, and, heat, pumps, flare, connections, require, that, the, end, of, a, tubing, section, be, spread, outward, in, a, bell, shape, using, a, flare, tool, a, flare, nut, then, compresses, this, bell, shaped, end, onto, a, male, fitting, flare, connections, are, a, labor, intensive, method, of, making, connections, but, are, quite, reliable, over, the, course, of, many, years, rigid, copper, is, a, popular, choice, for, water, lines, it, is, joined, using, a, sweat, compression, or, crimped, pressed, connection, rigid, copper, rigid, due, to, the, work, hardening, of, the, drawing, process, cannot, be, bent, and, must, use, elbow, fittings, to, go, around, corners, or, around, obstacles, if, heated, and, allowed, to, slowly, cool, called, annealing, then, rigid, copper, will, become, soft, and, can, be, bent, formed, without, cracking, solder, fittings, are, smooth, and, easily, slip, onto, the, end, of, a, tubing, section, both, the, male, and, female, ends, of, the, pipe, or, pipe, connectors, are, cleaned, thoroughly, then, coated, with, flux, to, make, sure, there, is, no, surface, oxide, and, to, ensure, that, the, solder, will, bond, properly, with, the, base, metal, the, joint, is, then, heated, using, a, torch, and, solder, is, melted, into, the, connection, when, the, solder, cools, it, forms, a, very, strong, bond, which, can, last, for, decades, solder, connected, rigid, copper, is, the, most, popular, choice, for, water, supply, lines, in, modern, buildings, in, situations, where, many, connections, must, be, made, at, once, such, as, plumbing, of, a, new, building, solder, offers, much, quicker, and, much, less, expensive, joinery, than, compression, or, flare, fittings, the, term, sweating, is, sometimes, used, to, describe, the, process, of, soldering, pipes, compression, fittings, use, a, soft, metal, or, thermoplastic, ring, the, compression, ring, or, ferrule, which, is, squeezed, onto, the, pipe, and, into, the, fitting, by, a, compression, nut, the, soft, metal, conforms, to, the, surface, of, the, tubing, and, the, fitting, and, creates, a, seal, compression, connections, do, not, typically, have, the, long, life, that, sweat, connections, offer, but, are, advantageous, in, many, cases, because, they, are, easy, to, make, using, basic, tools, a, disadvantage, in, compression, connections, is, that, they, take, longer, to, make, than, sweat, and, sometimes, require, retightening, over, time, to, stop, leaks, crimped, or, pressed, connections, use, special, copper, fittings, which, are, permanently, attached, to, rigid, copper, tubing, with, a, powered, crimper, the, special, fittings, manufactured, with, sealant, already, inside, slide, over, the, tubing, to, be, connected, thousands, of, pounds, force, per, square, inch, of, pressure, are, used, to, deform, the, fitting, and, compress, the, sealant, against, the, inner, copper, tubing, creating, a, watertight, seal, advantages, of, this, method, are, disadvantages, are, aluminium, is, sometimes, used, due, to, its, low, cost, resistance, to, corrosion, and, solvents, and, its, ductility, aluminium, tube, is, more, desirable, than, steel, for, the, conveyance, of, flammable, solvents, since, it, cannot, create, sparks, when, manipulated, aluminium, tubing, can, be, connected, by, flare, or, compression, fittings, or, it, can, be, welded, by, the, tig, or, heliarc, processes, tempered, glass, pipes, are, used, for, specialized, applications, such, as, corrosive, liquids, medical, or, laboratory, wastes, or, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, connections, are, generally, made, using, specialized, gasket, or, o, ring, fittings, plastic, pipes, used, in, manufacturing, plastic, pipe, fittings, include, pvc, pipe, fittings, pp, pph, pipe, fitting, mould, pe, pipe, and, abs, pipe,
