a, pulley, is, a, wheel, on, an, axle, or, shaft, enabling, a, taut, cable, or, belt, passing, over, the, wheel, to, move, and, change, direction, or, transfer, power, between, itself, and, a, shaft, a, sheave, or, pulley, wheel, is, a, pulley, using, an, axle, supported, by, a, frame, or, shell, block, to, guide, a, cable, or, exert, force, a, pulley, may, have, a, groove, or, grooves, between, flanges, around, its, circumference, to, locate, the, cable, or, belt, the, drive, element, of, a, pulley, system, can, be, a, rope, cable, belt, or, chain, the, earliest, evidence, of, pulleys, dates, back, to, ancient, egypt, in, the, twelfth, dynasty, 1991, 1802, bc, and, mesopotamia, in, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bc, in, roman, egypt, hero, of, alexandria, c, 10, 70, ad, identified, the, pulley, as, one, of, six, simple, machines, used, to, lift, weights, pulleys, are, assembled, to, form, a, block, and, tackle, in, order, to, provide, mechanical, advantage, to, apply, large, forces, pulleys, are, also, assembled, as, part, of, belt, and, chain, drives, in, order, to, transmit, power, from, one, rotating, shaft, to, another, plutarch, s, parallel, lives, recounts, a, scene, where, archimedes, proved, the, effectiveness, of, compound, pulleys, and, the, block, and, tackle, system, by, using, one, to, pull, a, fully, laden, ship, towards, him, as, if, it, was, gliding, through, water, a, block, is, a, set, of, pulleys, wheels, assembled, so, that, each, pulley, rotates, independently, from, every, other, pulley, two, blocks, with, a, rope, attached, to, one, of, the, blocks, and, threaded, through, the, two, sets, of, pulleys, form, a, block, and, tackle, a, block, and, tackle, is, assembled, so, one, block, is, attached, to, the, fixed, mounting, point, and, the, other, is, attached, to, the, moving, load, the, ideal, mechanical, advantage, of, the, block, and, tackle, is, equal, to, the, number, of, sections, of, the, rope, that, support, the, moving, block, in, the, diagram, on, the, right, the, ideal, mechanical, advantage, of, each, of, the, block, and, tackle, assemblies, shown, is, as, follows, a, rope, and, pulley, system, that, is, a, block, and, tackle, is, characterised, by, the, use, of, a, single, continuous, rope, to, transmit, a, tension, force, around, one, or, more, pulleys, to, lift, or, move, a, load, the, rope, may, be, a, light, line, or, a, strong, cable, this, system, is, included, in, the, list, of, simple, machines, identified, by, renaissance, scientists, if, the, rope, and, pulley, system, does, not, dissipate, or, store, energy, then, its, mechanical, advantage, is, the, number, of, parts, of, the, rope, that, act, on, the, load, this, can, be, shown, as, follows, consider, the, set, of, pulleys, that, form, the, moving, block, and, the, parts, of, the, rope, that, support, this, block, if, there, are, p, of, these, parts, of, the, rope, supporting, the, load, w, then, a, force, balance, on, the, moving, block, shows, that, the, tension, in, each, of, the, parts, of, the, rope, must, be, w, p, this, means, the, input, force, on, the, rope, is, t, w, p, thus, the, block, and, tackle, reduces, the, input, force, by, the, factor, p, the, simplest, theory, of, operation, for, a, pulley, system, assumes, that, the, pulleys, and, lines, are, weightless, and, that, there, is, no, energy, loss, due, to, friction, it, is, also, assumed, that, the, lines, do, not, stretch, in, equilibrium, the, forces, on, the, moving, block, must, sum, to, zero, in, addition, the, tension, in, the, rope, must, be, the, same, for, each, of, its, parts, this, means, that, the, two, parts, of, the, rope, supporting, the, moving, block, must, each, support, half, the, load, these, are, different, types, of, pulley, systems, the, mechanical, advantage, of, the, gun, tackle, can, be, increased, by, interchanging, the, fixed, and, moving, blocks, so, the, rope, is, attached, to, the, moving, block, and, the, rope, is, pulled, in, the, direction, of, the, lifted, load, in, this, case, the, block, and, tackle, is, said, to, be, rove, to, advantage, diagram, 3, shows, that, now, three, rope, parts, support, the, load, w, which, means, the, tension, in, the, rope, is, w, 3, thus, the, mechanical, advantage, is, three, by, adding, a, pulley, to, the, fixed, block, of, a, gun, tackle, the, direction, of, the, pulling, force, is, reversed, though, the, mechanical, advantage, remains, the, same, diagram, 3a, this, is, an, example, of, the, luff, tackle, the, mechanical, advantage, of, a, pulley, system, can, be, analysed, using, free, body, diagrams, which, balance, the, tension, force, in, the, rope, with, the, force, of, gravity, on, the, load, in, an, ideal, system, the, massless, and, frictionless, pulleys, do, not, dissipate, energy, and, allow, for, a, change, of, direction, of, a, rope, that, does, not, stretch, or, wear, in, this, case, a, force, balance, on, a, free, body, that, includes, the, load, w, and, n, supporting, sections, of, a, rope, with, tension, t, yields, the, ratio, of, the, load, to, the, input, tension, force, is, the, mechanical, advantage, ma, of, the, pulley, system, thus, the, mechanical, advantage, of, the, system, is, equal, to, the, number, of, sections, of, rope, supporting, the, load, a, belt, and, pulley, system, is, characterized, by, two, or, more, pulleys, in, common, to, a, belt, this, allows, for, mechanical, power, torque, and, speed, to, be, transmitted, across, axles, if, the, pulleys, are, of, differing, diameters, a, mechanical, advantage, is, realized, a, belt, drive, is, analogous, to, that, of, a, chain, drive, however, a, belt, sheave, may, be, smooth, devoid, of, discrete, interlocking, members, as, would, be, found, on, a, chain, sprocket, spur, gear, or, timing, belt, so, that, the, mechanical, advantage, is, approximately, given, by, the, ratio, of, the, pitch, diameter, of, the, sheaves, only, not, fixed, exactly, by, the, ratio, of, teeth, as, with, gears, and, sprockets, in, the, case, of, a, drum, style, pulley, without, a, groove, or, flanges, the, pulley, often, is, slightly, convex, to, keep, the, flat, belt, centered, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, crowned, pulley, though, once, widely, used, on, factory, line, shafts, this, type, of, pulley, is, still, found, driving, the, rotating, brush, in, upright, vacuum, cleaners, in, belt, sanders, and, bandsaws, agricultural, tractors, built, up, to, the, early, 1950s, generally, had, a, belt, pulley, for, a, flat, belt, which, is, what, belt, pulley, magazine, was, named, after, it, has, been, replaced, by, other, mechanisms, with, more, flexibility, in, methods, of, use, such, as, power, take, off, and, hydraulics, just, as, the, diameters, of, gears, and, correspondingly, their, number, of, teeth, determine, a, gear, ratio, and, thus, the, speed, increases, or, reductions, and, the, mechanical, advantage, that, they, can, deliver, the, diameters, of, pulleys, determine, those, same, factors, cone, pulleys, and, step, pulleys, which, operate, on, the, same, principle, although, the, names, tend, to, be, applied, to, flat, belt, versions, and, v, belt, versions, respectively, are, a, way, to, provide, multiple, drive, ratios, in, a, belt, and, pulley, system, that, can, be, shifted, as, needed, just, as, a, transmission, provides, this, function, with, a, gear, train, that, can, be, shifted, v, belt, step, pulleys, are, the, most, common, way, that, drill, presses, deliver, a, range, of, spindle, speeds, with, belts, and, pulleys, friction, is, one, of, the, most, important, forces, some, uses, for, belts, and, pulleys, involve, peculiar, angles, leading, to, bad, belt, tracking, and, possibly, slipping, the, belt, off, the, pulley, or, low, belt, tension, environments, causing, unnecessary, slippage, of, the, belt, and, hence, extra, wear, to, the, belt, to, solve, this, pulleys, are, sometimes, lagged, lagging, is, the, term, used, to, describe, the, application, of, a, coating, cover, or, wearing, surface, with, various, textured, patterns, which, is, sometimes, applied, to, pulley, shells, lagging, is, often, applied, in, order, to, extend, the, life, of, the, shell, by, providing, a, replaceable, wearing, surface, or, to, improve, the, friction, between, the, belt, and, the, pulley, notably, drive, pulleys, are, often, rubber, lagged, coated, with, a, rubber, friction, layer, for, exactly, this, reason, applying, powdered, rosin, to, the, belt, may, increase, the, friction, temporarily, but, may, shorten, the, life, of, the, belt
