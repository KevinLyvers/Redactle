an, internal, combustion, engine, ice, or, ic, engine, is, a, heat, engine, in, which, the, combustion, of, a, fuel, occurs, with, an, oxidizer, usually, air, in, a, combustion, chamber, that, is, an, integral, part, of, the, working, fluid, flow, circuit, in, an, internal, combustion, engine, the, expansion, of, the, high, temperature, and, high, pressure, gases, produced, by, combustion, applies, direct, force, to, some, component, of, the, engine, the, force, is, typically, applied, to, pistons, piston, engine, turbine, blades, gas, turbine, a, rotor, wankel, engine, or, a, nozzle, jet, engine, this, force, moves, the, component, over, a, distance, this, process, transforms, chemical, energy, into, kinetic, energy, which, is, used, to, propel, move, or, power, whatever, the, engine, is, attached, to, the, first, commercially, successful, internal, combustion, engine, was, created, by, tienne, lenoir, around, 1860, and, the, first, modern, internal, combustion, engine, known, as, the, otto, engine, was, created, in, 1876, by, nicolaus, otto, the, term, internal, combustion, engine, usually, refers, to, an, engine, in, which, combustion, is, intermittent, such, as, the, more, familiar, two, stroke, and, four, stroke, piston, engines, along, with, variants, such, as, the, six, stroke, piston, engine, and, the, wankel, rotary, engine, a, second, class, of, internal, combustion, engines, use, continuous, combustion, gas, turbines, jet, engines, and, most, rocket, engines, each, of, which, are, internal, combustion, engines, on, the, same, principle, as, previously, described, firearms, are, also, a, form, of, internal, combustion, engine, though, of, a, type, so, specialized, that, they, are, commonly, treated, as, a, separate, category, along, with, weaponry, such, as, mortars, and, anti, aircraft, cannons, in, contrast, in, external, combustion, engines, such, as, steam, or, stirling, engines, energy, is, delivered, to, a, working, fluid, not, consisting, of, mixed, with, or, contaminated, by, combustion, products, working, fluids, for, external, combustion, engines, include, air, hot, water, pressurized, water, or, even, boiler, heated, liquid, sodium, while, there, are, many, stationary, applications, most, ices, are, used, in, mobile, applications, and, are, the, primary, power, supply, for, vehicles, such, as, cars, aircraft, and, boats, ices, are, typically, powered, by, hydrocarbon, based, fuels, like, natural, gas, gasoline, diesel, fuel, or, ethanol, renewable, fuels, like, biodiesel, are, used, in, compression, ignition, ci, engines, and, bioethanol, or, etbe, ethyl, tert, butyl, ether, produced, from, bioethanol, in, spark, ignition, si, engines, as, early, as, 1900, the, inventor, of, the, diesel, engine, rudolf, diesel, was, using, peanut, oil, to, run, his, engines, renewable, fuels, are, commonly, blended, with, fossil, fuels, hydrogen, which, is, rarely, used, can, be, obtained, from, either, fossil, fuels, or, renewable, energy, various, scientists, and, engineers, contributed, to, the, development, of, internal, combustion, engines, in, 1791, john, barber, developed, the, gas, turbine, in, 1794, thomas, mead, patented, a, gas, engine, also, in, 1794, robert, street, patented, an, internal, combustion, engine, which, was, also, the, first, to, use, liquid, fuel, and, built, an, engine, around, that, time, in, 1798, john, stevens, built, the, first, american, internal, combustion, engine, in, 1807, french, engineers, nic, phore, ni, pce, who, went, on, to, invent, photography, and, claude, ni, pce, ran, a, prototype, internal, combustion, engine, using, controlled, dust, explosions, the, pyr, olophore, which, was, granted, a, patent, by, napoleon, bonaparte, this, engine, powered, a, boat, on, the, sa, ne, river, in, france, in, the, same, year, swiss, engineer, fran, ois, isaac, de, rivaz, invented, a, hydrogen, based, internal, combustion, engine, and, powered, the, engine, by, electric, spark, in, 1808, de, rivaz, fitted, his, invention, to, a, primitive, working, vehicle, the, world, s, first, internal, combustion, powered, automobile, in, 1823, samuel, brown, patented, the, first, internal, combustion, engine, to, be, applied, industrially, in, 1854, in, the, uk, the, italian, inventors, eugenio, barsanti, and, felice, matteucci, obtained, the, certification, obtaining, motive, power, by, the, explosion, of, gases, in, 1857, the, great, seal, patent, office, conceded, them, patent, no, 1655, for, the, invention, of, an, improved, apparatus, for, obtaining, motive, power, from, gases, barsanti, and, matteucci, obtained, other, patents, for, the, same, invention, in, france, belgium, and, piedmont, between, 1857, and, 1859, in, 1860, belgian, engineer, jean, joseph, etienne, lenoir, produced, a, gas, fired, internal, combustion, engine, in, 1864, nicolaus, otto, patented, the, first, atmospheric, gas, engine, in, 1872, american, george, brayton, invented, the, first, commercial, liquid, fueled, internal, combustion, engine, in, 1876, nicolaus, otto, began, working, with, gottlieb, daimler, and, wilhelm, maybach, patented, the, compressed, charge, four, cycle, engine, in, 1879, karl, benz, patented, a, reliable, two, stroke, gasoline, engine, later, in, 1886, benz, began, the, first, commercial, production, of, motor, vehicles, with, an, internal, combustion, engine, in, which, a, three, wheeled, four, cycle, engine, and, chassis, formed, a, single, unit, in, 1892, rudolf, diesel, developed, the, first, compressed, charge, compression, ignition, engine, in, 1926, robert, goddard, launched, the, first, liquid, fueled, rocket, in, 1939, the, heinkel, he, 178, became, the, world, s, first, jet, aircraft, at, one, time, the, word, engine, via, old, french, from, latin, ingenium, ability, meant, any, piece, of, machinery, a, sense, that, persists, in, expressions, such, as, siege, engine, a, motor, from, latin, motor, mover, is, any, machine, that, produces, mechanical, power, traditionally, electric, motors, are, not, referred, to, as, engines, however, combustion, engines, are, often, referred, to, as, motors, an, electric, engine, refers, to, a, locomotive, operated, by, electricity, in, boating, an, internal, combustion, engine, that, is, installed, in, the, hull, is, referred, to, as, an, engine, but, the, engines, that, sit, on, the, transom, are, referred, to, as, motors, reciprocating, piston, engines, are, by, far, the, most, common, power, source, for, land, and, water, vehicles, including, automobiles, motorcycles, ships, and, to, a, lesser, extent, locomotives, some, are, electrical, but, most, use, diesel, engines, rotary, engines, of, the, wankel, design, are, used, in, some, automobiles, aircraft, and, motorcycles, these, are, collectively, known, as, internal, combustion, engine, vehicles, icev, where, high, power, to, weight, ratios, are, required, internal, combustion, engines, appear, in, the, form, of, combustion, turbines, or, sometimes, wankel, engines, powered, aircraft, typically, use, an, ice, which, may, be, a, reciprocating, engine, airplanes, can, instead, use, jet, engines, and, helicopters, can, instead, employ, turboshafts, both, of, which, are, types, of, turbines, in, addition, to, providing, propulsion, airliners, may, employ, a, separate, ice, as, an, auxiliary, power, unit, wankel, engines, are, fitted, to, many, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, ices, drive, large, electric, generators, that, power, electrical, grids, they, are, found, in, the, form, of, combustion, turbines, with, a, typical, electrical, output, in, the, range, of, some, 100, mw, combined, cycle, power, plants, use, the, high, temperature, exhaust, to, boil, and, superheat, water, steam, to, run, a, steam, turbine, thus, the, efficiency, is, higher, because, more, energy, is, extracted, from, the, fuel, than, what, could, be, extracted, by, the, combustion, engine, alone, combined, cycle, power, plants, achieve, efficiencies, in, the, range, of, 50, 60, in, a, smaller, scale, stationary, engines, like, gas, engines, or, diesel, generators, are, used, for, backup, or, for, providing, electrical, power, to, areas, not, connected, to, an, electric, grid, small, engines, usually, 2, stroke, gasoline, petrol, engines, are, a, common, power, source, for, lawnmowers, string, trimmers, chain, saws, leafblowers, pressure, washers, snowmobiles, jet, skis, outboard, motors, mopeds, and, motorcycles, there, are, several, possible, ways, to, classify, internal, combustion, engines, by, number, of, strokes, by, type, of, ignition, by, mechanical, thermodynamic, cycle, these, cycles, are, infrequently, used, but, are, commonly, found, in, hybrid, vehicles, along, with, other, vehicles, manufactured, for, fuel, efficiency, the, base, of, a, reciprocating, internal, combustion, engine, is, the, engine, block, which, is, typically, made, of, cast, iron, due, to, its, good, wear, resistance, and, low, cost, or, aluminum, in, the, latter, case, the, cylinder, liners, are, made, of, cast, iron, or, steel, or, a, coating, such, as, nikasil, or, alusil, the, engine, block, contains, the, cylinders, in, engines, with, more, than, one, cylinder, they, are, usually, arranged, either, in, 1, row, straight, engine, or, 2, rows, boxer, engine, or, v, engine, 3, or, 4, rows, are, occasionally, used, w, engine, in, contemporary, engines, and, other, engine, configurations, are, possible, and, have, been, used, single, cylinder, engines, or, thumpers, are, common, for, motorcycles, and, other, small, engines, found, in, light, machinery, on, the, outer, side, of, the, cylinder, passages, that, contain, cooling, fluid, are, cast, into, the, engine, block, whereas, in, some, heavy, duty, engines, the, passages, are, the, types, of, removable, cylinder, sleeves, which, can, be, replaceable, water, cooled, engines, contain, passages, in, the, engine, block, where, cooling, fluid, circulates, the, water, jacket, some, small, engines, are, air, cooled, and, instead, of, having, a, water, jacket, the, cylinder, block, has, fins, protruding, away, from, it, to, cool, the, engine, by, directly, transferring, heat, to, the, air, the, cylinder, walls, are, usually, finished, by, honing, to, obtain, a, cross, hatch, which, is, able, to, retain, more, oil, a, too, rough, surface, would, quickly, harm, the, engine, by, excessive, wear, on, the, piston, the, pistons, are, short, cylindrical, parts, which, seal, one, end, of, the, cylinder, from, the, high, pressure, of, the, compressed, air, and, combustion, products, and, slide, continuously, within, it, while, the, engine, is, in, operation, in, smaller, engines, the, pistons, are, made, of, aluminum, while, in, larger, applications, they, are, typically, made, of, cast, iron, in, performance, applications, pistons, can, also, be, titanium, or, forged, steel, for, greater, strength, the, top, surface, of, the, piston, is, called, its, crown, and, is, typically, flat, or, concave, some, two, stroke, engines, use, pistons, with, a, deflector, head, pistons, are, open, at, the, bottom, and, hollow, except, for, an, integral, reinforcement, structure, the, piston, web, when, an, engine, is, working, the, gas, pressure, in, the, combustion, chamber, exerts, a, force, on, the, piston, crown, which, is, transferred, through, its, web, to, a, gudgeon, pin, each, piston, has, rings, fitted, around, its, circumference, that, mostly, prevent, the, gases, from, leaking, into, the, crankcase, or, the, oil, into, the, combustion, chamber, a, ventilation, system, drives, the, small, amount, of, gas, that, escapes, past, the, pistons, during, normal, operation, the, blow, by, gases, out, of, the, crankcase, so, that, it, does, not, accumulate, contaminating, the, oil, and, creating, corrosion, in, two, stroke, gasoline, engines, the, crankcase, is, part, of, the, air, fuel, path, and, due, to, the, continuous, flow, of, it, two, stroke, engines, do, not, need, a, separate, crankcase, ventilation, system, the, cylinder, head, is, attached, to, the, engine, block, by, numerous, bolts, or, studs, it, has, several, functions, the, cylinder, head, seals, the, cylinders, on, the, side, opposite, to, the, pistons, it, contains, short, ducts, the, ports, for, intake, and, exhaust, and, the, associated, intake, valves, that, open, to, let, the, cylinder, be, filled, with, fresh, air, and, exhaust, valves, that, open, to, allow, the, combustion, gases, to, escape, the, valves, are, often, poppet, valves, but, they, can, also, be, rotary, valves, or, sleeve, valves, however, 2, stroke, crankcase, scavenged, engines, connect, the, gas, ports, directly, to, the, cylinder, wall, without, poppet, valves, the, piston, controls, their, opening, and, occlusion, instead, the, cylinder, head, also, holds, the, spark, plug, in, the, case, of, spark, ignition, engines, and, the, injector, for, engines, that, use, direct, injection, all, ci, compression, ignition, engines, use, fuel, injection, usually, direct, injection, but, some, engines, instead, use, indirect, injection, si, spark, ignition, engines, can, use, a, carburetor, or, fuel, injection, as, port, injection, or, direct, injection, most, si, engines, have, a, single, spark, plug, per, cylinder, but, some, have, 2, a, head, gasket, prevents, the, gas, from, leaking, between, the, cylinder, head, and, the, engine, block, the, opening, and, closing, of, the, valves, is, controlled, by, one, or, several, camshafts, and, springs, or, in, some, engines, a, desmodromic, mechanism, that, uses, no, springs, the, camshaft, may, press, directly, the, stem, of, the, valve, or, may, act, upon, a, rocker, arm, again, either, directly, or, through, a, pushrod, the, crankcase, is, sealed, at, the, bottom, with, a, sump, that, collects, the, falling, oil, during, normal, operation, to, be, cycled, again, the, cavity, created, between, the, cylinder, block, and, the, sump, houses, a, crankshaft, that, converts, the, reciprocating, motion, of, the, pistons, to, rotational, motion, the, crankshaft, is, held, in, place, relative, to, the, engine, block, by, main, bearings, which, allow, it, to, rotate, bulkheads, in, the, crankcase, form, a, half, of, every, main, bearing, the, other, half, is, a, detachable, cap, in, some, cases, a, single, main, bearing, deck, is, used, rather, than, several, smaller, caps, a, connecting, rod, is, connected, to, offset, sections, of, the, crankshaft, the, crankpins, in, one, end, and, to, the, piston, in, the, other, end, through, the, gudgeon, pin, and, thus, transfers, the, force, and, translates, the, reciprocating, motion, of, the, pistons, to, the, circular, motion, of, the, crankshaft, the, end, of, the, connecting, rod, attached, to, the, gudgeon, pin, is, called, its, small, end, and, the, other, end, where, it, is, connected, to, the, crankshaft, the, big, end, the, big, end, has, a, detachable, half, to, allow, assembly, around, the, crankshaft, it, is, kept, together, to, the, connecting, rod, by, removable, bolts, the, cylinder, head, has, an, intake, manifold, and, an, exhaust, manifold, attached, to, the, corresponding, ports, the, intake, manifold, connects, to, the, air, filter, directly, or, to, a, carburetor, when, one, is, present, which, is, then, connected, to, the, air, filter, it, distributes, the, air, incoming, from, these, devices, to, the, individual, cylinders, the, exhaust, manifold, is, the, first, component, in, the, exhaust, system, it, collects, the, exhaust, gases, from, the, cylinders, and, drives, it, to, the, following, component, in, the, path, the, exhaust, system, of, an, ice, may, also, include, a, catalytic, converter, and, muffler, the, final, section, in, the, path, of, the, exhaust, gases, is, the, tailpipe, the, top, dead, center, tdc, of, a, piston, is, the, position, where, it, is, nearest, to, the, valves, bottom, dead, center, bdc, is, the, opposite, position, where, it, is, furthest, from, them, a, stroke, is, the, movement, of, a, piston, from, tdc, to, bdc, or, vice, versa, together, with, the, associated, process, while, an, engine, is, in, operation, the, crankshaft, rotates, continuously, at, a, nearly, constant, speed, in, a, 4, stroke, ice, each, piston, experiences, 2, strokes, per, crankshaft, revolution, in, the, following, order, starting, the, description, at, tdc, these, are, the, defining, characteristic, of, this, kind, of, engine, is, that, each, piston, completes, a, cycle, every, crankshaft, revolution, the, 4, processes, of, intake, compression, power, and, exhaust, take, place, in, only, 2, strokes, so, that, it, is, not, possible, to, dedicate, a, stroke, exclusively, for, each, of, them, starting, at, tdc, the, cycle, consists, of, while, a, 4, stroke, engine, uses, the, piston, as, a, positive, displacement, pump, to, accomplish, scavenging, taking, 2, of, the, 4, strokes, a, 2, stroke, engine, uses, the, last, part, of, the, power, stroke, and, the, first, part, of, the, compression, stroke, for, combined, intake, and, exhaust, the, work, required, to, displace, the, charge, and, exhaust, gases, comes, from, either, the, crankcase, or, a, separate, blower, for, scavenging, expulsion, of, burned, gas, and, entry, of, fresh, mix, two, main, approaches, are, described, loop, scavenging, and, uniflow, scavenging, sae, news, published, in, the, 2010s, that, loop, scavenging, is, better, under, any, circumstance, than, uniflow, scavenging, some, si, engines, are, crankcase, scavenged, and, do, not, use, poppet, valves, instead, the, crankcase, and, the, part, of, the, cylinder, below, the, piston, is, used, as, a, pump, the, intake, port, is, connected, to, the, crankcase, through, a, reed, valve, or, a, rotary, disk, valve, driven, by, the, engine, for, each, cylinder, a, transfer, port, connects, in, one, end, to, the, crankcase, and, in, the, other, end, to, the, cylinder, wall, the, exhaust, port, is, connected, directly, to, the, cylinder, wall, the, transfer, and, exhaust, port, are, opened, and, closed, by, the, piston, the, reed, valve, opens, when, the, crankcase, pressure, is, slightly, below, intake, pressure, to, let, it, be, filled, with, a, new, charge, this, happens, when, the, piston, is, moving, upwards, when, the, piston, is, moving, downwards, the, pressure, in, the, crankcase, increases, and, the, reed, valve, closes, promptly, then, the, charge, in, the, crankcase, is, compressed, when, the, piston, is, moving, downwards, it, also, uncovers, the, exhaust, port, and, the, transfer, port, and, the, higher, pressure, of, the, charge, in, the, crankcase, makes, it, enter, the, cylinder, through, the, transfer, port, blowing, the, exhaust, gases, lubrication, is, accomplished, by, adding, two, stroke, oil, to, the, fuel, in, small, ratios, petroil, refers, to, the, mix, of, gasoline, with, the, aforesaid, oil, this, kind, of, 2, stroke, engine, has, a, lower, efficiency, than, comparable, 4, strokes, engines, and, releases, more, polluting, exhaust, gases, for, the, following, conditions, the, main, advantage, of, 2, stroke, engines, of, this, type, is, mechanical, simplicity, and, a, higher, power, to, weight, ratio, than, their, 4, stroke, counterparts, despite, having, twice, as, many, power, strokes, per, cycle, less, than, twice, the, power, of, a, comparable, 4, stroke, engine, is, attainable, in, practice, in, the, us, 2, stroke, engines, were, banned, for, road, vehicles, due, to, the, pollution, off, road, only, motorcycles, are, still, often, 2, stroke, but, are, rarely, road, legal, however, many, thousands, of, 2, stroke, lawn, maintenance, engines, are, in, use, using, a, separate, blower, avoids, many, of, the, shortcomings, of, crankcase, scavenging, at, the, expense, of, increased, complexity, which, means, a, higher, cost, and, an, increase, in, maintenance, requirement, an, engine, of, this, type, uses, ports, or, valves, for, intake, and, valves, for, exhaust, except, opposed, piston, engines, which, may, also, use, ports, for, exhaust, the, blower, is, usually, of, the, roots, type, but, other, types, have, been, used, too, this, design, is, commonplace, in, ci, engines, and, has, been, occasionally, used, in, si, engines, ci, engines, that, use, a, blower, typically, use, uniflow, scavenging, in, this, design, the, cylinder, wall, contains, several, intake, ports, placed, uniformly, spaced, along, the, circumference, just, above, the, position, that, the, piston, crown, reaches, when, at, bdc, an, exhaust, valve, or, several, like, that, of, 4, stroke, engines, is, used, the, final, part, of, the, intake, manifold, is, an, air, sleeve, that, feeds, the, intake, ports, the, intake, ports, are, placed, at, a, horizontal, angle, to, the, cylinder, wall, i, e, they, are, in, plane, of, the, piston, crown, to, give, a, swirl, to, the, incoming, charge, to, improve, combustion, the, largest, reciprocating, ic, are, low, speed, ci, engines, of, this, type, they, are, used, for, marine, propulsion, see, marine, diesel, engine, or, electric, power, generation, and, achieve, the, highest, thermal, efficiencies, among, internal, combustion, engines, of, any, kind, some, diesel, electric, locomotive, engines, operate, on, the, 2, stroke, cycle, the, most, powerful, of, them, have, a, brake, power, of, around, 4, 5, mw, or, 6, 000, hp, the, emd, sd90mac, class, of, locomotives, are, an, example, of, such, the, comparable, class, ge, ac6000cw, whose, prime, mover, has, almost, the, same, brake, power, uses, a, 4, stroke, engine, an, example, of, this, type, of, engine, is, the, w, rtsil, sulzer, rta96, c, turbocharged, 2, stroke, diesel, used, in, large, container, ships, it, is, the, most, efficient, and, powerful, reciprocating, internal, combustion, engine, in, the, world, with, a, thermal, efficiency, over, 50, for, comparison, the, most, efficient, small, four, stroke, engines, are, around, 43, thermally, efficient, sae, 900648, size, is, an, advantage, for, efficiency, due, to, the, increase, in, the, ratio, of, volume, to, surface, area, see, the, external, links, for, an, in, cylinder, combustion, video, in, a, 2, stroke, optically, accessible, motorcycle, engine, dugald, clerk, developed, the, first, two, cycle, engine, in, 1879, it, used, a, separate, cylinder, which, functioned, as, a, pump, in, order, to, transfer, the, fuel, mixture, to, the, cylinder, in, 1899, john, day, simplified, clerk, s, design, into, the, type, of, 2, cycle, engine, that, is, very, widely, used, today, day, cycle, engines, are, crankcase, scavenged, and, port, timed, the, crankcase, and, the, part, of, the, cylinder, below, the, exhaust, port, is, used, as, a, pump, the, operation, of, the, day, cycle, engine, begins, when, the, crankshaft, is, turned, so, that, the, piston, moves, from, bdc, upward, toward, the, head, creating, a, vacuum, in, the, crankcase, cylinder, area, the, carburetor, then, feeds, the, fuel, mixture, into, the, crankcase, through, a, reed, valve, or, a, rotary, disk, valve, driven, by, the, engine, there, are, cast, in, ducts, from, the, crankcase, to, the, port, in, the, cylinder, to, provide, for, intake, and, another, from, the, exhaust, port, to, the, exhaust, pipe, the, height, of, the, port, in, relationship, to, the, length, of, the, cylinder, is, called, the, port, timing, on, the, first, upstroke, of, the, engine, there, would, be, no, fuel, inducted, into, the, cylinder, as, the, crankcase, was, empty, on, the, downstroke, the, piston, now, compresses, the, fuel, mix, which, has, lubricated, the, piston, in, the, cylinder, and, the, bearings, due, to, the, fuel, mix, having, oil, added, to, it, as, the, piston, moves, downward, it, first, uncovers, the, exhaust, but, on, the, first, stroke, there, is, no, burnt, fuel, to, exhaust, as, the, piston, moves, downward, further, it, uncovers, the, intake, port, which, has, a, duct, that, runs, to, the, crankcase, since, the, fuel, mix, in, the, crankcase, is, under, pressure, the, mix, moves, through, the, duct, and, into, the, cylinder, because, there, is, no, obstruction, in, the, cylinder, of, the, fuel, to, move, directly, out, of, the, exhaust, port, prior, to, the, piston, rising, far, enough, to, close, the, port, early, engines, used, a, high, domed, piston, to, slow, down, the, flow, of, fuel, later, the, fuel, was, resonated, back, into, the, cylinder, using, an, expansion, chamber, design, when, the, piston, rose, close, to, tdc, a, spark, ignited, the, fuel, as, the, piston, is, driven, downward, with, power, it, first, uncovers, the, exhaust, port, where, the, burned, fuel, is, expelled, under, high, pressure, and, then, the, intake, port, where, the, process, has, been, completed, and, will, keep, repeating, later, engines, used, a, type, of, porting, devised, by, the, deutz, company, to, improve, performance, it, was, called, the, schnurle, reverse, flow, system, dkw, licensed, this, design, for, all, their, motorcycles, their, dkw, rt, 125, was, one, of, the, first, motor, vehicles, to, achieve, over, 100, mpg, as, a, result, internal, combustion, engines, require, ignition, of, the, mixture, either, by, spark, ignition, si, or, compression, ignition, ci, before, the, invention, of, reliable, electrical, methods, hot, tube, and, flame, methods, were, used, experimental, engines, with, laser, ignition, have, been, built, the, spark, ignition, engine, was, a, refinement, of, the, early, engines, which, used, hot, tube, ignition, when, bosch, developed, the, magneto, it, became, the, primary, system, for, producing, electricity, to, energize, a, spark, plug, many, small, engines, still, use, magneto, ignition, small, engines, are, started, by, hand, cranking, using, a, recoil, starter, or, hand, crank, prior, to, charles, f, kettering, of, delco, s, development, of, the, automotive, starter, all, gasoline, engined, automobiles, used, a, hand, crank, larger, engines, typically, power, their, starting, motors, and, ignition, systems, using, the, electrical, energy, stored, in, a, lead, acid, battery, the, battery, s, charged, state, is, maintained, by, an, automotive, alternator, or, previously, a, generator, which, uses, engine, power, to, create, electrical, energy, storage, the, battery, supplies, electrical, power, for, starting, when, the, engine, has, a, starting, motor, system, and, supplies, electrical, power, when, the, engine, is, off, the, battery, also, supplies, electrical, power, during, rare, run, conditions, where, the, alternator, cannot, maintain, more, than, 13, 8, volts, for, a, common, 12, v, automotive, electrical, system, as, alternator, voltage, falls, below, 13, 8, volts, the, lead, acid, storage, battery, increasingly, picks, up, electrical, load, during, virtually, all, running, conditions, including, normal, idle, conditions, the, alternator, supplies, primary, electrical, power, some, systems, disable, alternator, field, rotor, power, during, wide, open, throttle, conditions, disabling, the, field, reduces, alternator, pulley, mechanical, loading, to, nearly, zero, maximizing, crankshaft, power, in, this, case, the, battery, supplies, all, primary, electrical, power, gasoline, engines, take, in, a, mixture, of, air, and, gasoline, and, compress, it, by, the, movement, of, the, piston, from, bottom, dead, center, to, top, dead, center, when, the, fuel, is, at, maximum, compression, the, reduction, in, the, size, of, the, swept, area, of, the, cylinder, and, taking, into, account, the, volume, of, the, combustion, chamber, is, described, by, a, ratio, early, engines, had, compression, ratios, of, 6, to, 1, as, compression, ratios, were, increased, the, efficiency, of, the, engine, increased, as, well, with, early, induction, and, ignition, systems, the, compression, ratios, had, to, be, kept, low, with, advances, in, fuel, technology, and, combustion, management, high, performance, engines, can, run, reliably, at, 12, 1, ratio, with, low, octane, fuel, a, problem, would, occur, as, the, compression, ratio, increased, as, the, fuel, was, igniting, due, to, the, rise, in, temperature, that, resulted, charles, kettering, developed, a, lead, additive, which, allowed, higher, compression, ratios, which, was, progressively, abandoned, for, automotive, use, from, the, 1970s, onward, partly, due, to, lead, poisoning, concerns, the, fuel, mixture, is, ignited, at, different, progressions, of, the, piston, in, the, cylinder, at, low, rpm, the, spark, is, timed, to, occur, close, to, the, piston, achieving, top, dead, center, in, order, to, produce, more, power, as, rpm, rises, the, spark, is, advanced, sooner, during, piston, movement, the, spark, occurs, while, the, fuel, is, still, being, compressed, progressively, more, as, rpm, rises, the, necessary, high, voltage, typically, 10, 000, volts, is, supplied, by, an, induction, coil, or, transformer, the, induction, coil, is, a, fly, back, system, using, interruption, of, electrical, primary, system, current, through, some, type, of, synchronized, interrupter, the, interrupter, can, be, either, contact, points, or, a, power, transistor, the, problem, with, this, type, of, ignition, is, that, as, rpm, increases, the, availability, of, electrical, energy, decreases, this, is, especially, a, problem, since, the, amount, of, energy, needed, to, ignite, a, more, dense, fuel, mixture, is, higher, the, result, was, often, a, high, rpm, misfire, capacitor, discharge, ignition, was, developed, it, produces, a, rising, voltage, that, is, sent, to, the, spark, plug, cd, system, voltages, can, reach, 60, 000, volts, cd, ignitions, use, step, up, transformers, the, step, up, transformer, uses, energy, stored, in, a, capacitance, to, generate, electric, spark, with, either, system, a, mechanical, or, electrical, control, system, provides, a, carefully, timed, high, voltage, to, the, proper, cylinder, this, spark, via, the, spark, plug, ignites, the, air, fuel, mixture, in, the, engine, s, cylinders, while, gasoline, internal, combustion, engines, are, much, easier, to, start, in, cold, weather, than, diesel, engines, they, can, still, have, cold, weather, starting, problems, under, extreme, conditions, for, years, the, solution, was, to, park, the, car, in, heated, areas, in, some, parts, of, the, world, the, oil, was, actually, drained, and, heated, overnight, and, returned, to, the, engine, for, cold, starts, in, the, early, 1950s, the, gasoline, gasifier, unit, was, developed, where, on, cold, weather, starts, raw, gasoline, was, diverted, to, the, unit, where, part, of, the, fuel, was, burned, causing, the, other, part, to, become, a, hot, vapor, sent, directly, to, the, intake, valve, manifold, this, unit, was, quite, popular, until, electric, engine, block, heaters, became, standard, on, gasoline, engines, sold, in, cold, climates, for, ignition, diesel, ppc, and, hcci, engines, rely, solely, on, the, high, temperature, and, pressure, created, by, the, engine, in, its, compression, process, the, compression, level, that, occurs, is, usually, twice, or, more, than, a, gasoline, engine, diesel, engines, take, in, air, only, and, shortly, before, peak, compression, spray, a, small, quantity, of, diesel, fuel, into, the, cylinder, via, a, fuel, injector, that, allows, the, fuel, to, instantly, ignite, hcci, type, engines, take, in, both, air, and, fuel, but, continue, to, rely, on, an, unaided, auto, combustion, process, due, to, higher, pressures, and, temperature, this, is, also, why, diesel, and, hcci, engines, are, more, susceptible, to, cold, starting, issues, although, they, run, just, as, well, in, cold, weather, once, started, light, duty, diesel, engines, with, indirect, injection, in, automobiles, and, light, trucks, employ, glowplugs, or, other, pre, heating, see, cummins, isb, 6bt, that, pre, heat, the, combustion, chamber, just, before, starting, to, reduce, no, start, conditions, in, cold, weather, most, diesels, also, have, a, battery, and, charging, system, nevertheless, this, system, is, secondary, and, is, added, by, manufacturers, as, a, luxury, for, the, ease, of, starting, turning, fuel, on, and, off, which, can, also, be, done, via, a, switch, or, mechanical, apparatus, and, for, running, auxiliary, electrical, components, and, accessories, most, new, engines, rely, on, electrical, and, electronic, engine, control, units, ecu, that, also, adjust, the, combustion, process, to, increase, efficiency, and, reduce, emissions, surfaces, in, contact, and, relative, motion, to, other, surfaces, require, lubrication, to, reduce, wear, noise, and, increase, efficiency, by, reducing, the, power, wasting, in, overcoming, friction, or, to, make, the, mechanism, work, at, all, also, the, lubricant, used, can, reduce, excess, heat, and, provide, additional, cooling, to, components, at, the, very, least, an, engine, requires, lubrication, in, the, following, parts, in, 2, stroke, crankcase, scavenged, engines, the, interior, of, the, crankcase, and, therefore, the, crankshaft, connecting, rod, and, bottom, of, the, pistons, are, sprayed, by, the, two, stroke, oil, in, the, air, fuel, oil, mixture, which, is, then, burned, along, with, the, fuel, the, valve, train, may, be, contained, in, a, compartment, flooded, with, lubricant, so, that, no, oil, pump, is, required, in, a, splash, lubrication, system, no, oil, pump, is, used, instead, the, crankshaft, dips, into, the, oil, in, the, sump, and, due, to, its, high, speed, it, splashes, the, crankshaft, connecting, rods, and, bottom, of, the, pistons, the, connecting, rod, big, end, caps, may, have, an, attached, scoop, to, enhance, this, effect, the, valve, train, may, also, be, sealed, in, a, flooded, compartment, or, open, to, the, crankshaft, in, a, way, that, it, receives, splashed, oil, and, allows, it, to, drain, back, to, the, sump, splash, lubrication, is, common, for, small, 4, stroke, engines, in, a, forced, also, called, pressurized, lubrication, system, lubrication, is, accomplished, in, a, closed, loop, which, carries, motor, oil, to, the, surfaces, serviced, by, the, system, and, then, returns, the, oil, to, a, reservoir, the, auxiliary, equipment, of, an, engine, is, typically, not, serviced, by, this, loop, for, instance, an, alternator, may, use, ball, bearings, sealed, with, their, own, lubricant, the, reservoir, for, the, oil, is, usually, the, sump, and, when, this, is, the, case, it, is, called, a, wet, sump, system, when, there, is, a, different, oil, reservoir, the, crankcase, still, catches, it, but, it, is, continuously, drained, by, a, dedicated, pump, this, is, called, a, dry, sump, system, on, its, bottom, the, sump, contains, an, oil, intake, covered, by, a, mesh, filter, which, is, connected, to, an, oil, pump, then, to, an, oil, filter, outside, the, crankcase, from, there, it, is, diverted, to, the, crankshaft, main, bearings, and, valve, train, the, crankcase, contains, at, least, one, oil, gallery, a, conduit, inside, a, crankcase, wall, to, which, oil, is, introduced, from, the, oil, filter, the, main, bearings, contain, a, groove, through, all, or, half, its, circumference, the, oil, enters, these, grooves, from, channels, connected, to, the, oil, gallery, the, crankshaft, has, drillings, that, take, oil, from, these, grooves, and, deliver, it, to, the, big, end, bearings, all, big, end, bearings, are, lubricated, this, way, a, single, main, bearing, may, provide, oil, for, 0, 1, or, 2, big, end, bearings, a, similar, system, may, be, used, to, lubricate, the, piston, its, gudgeon, pin, and, the, small, end, of, its, connecting, rod, in, this, system, the, connecting, rod, big, end, has, a, groove, around, the, crankshaft, and, a, drilling, connected, to, the, groove, which, distributes, oil, from, there, to, the, bottom, of, the, piston, and, from, then, to, the, cylinder, other, systems, are, also, used, to, lubricate, the, cylinder, and, piston, the, connecting, rod, may, have, a, nozzle, to, throw, an, oil, jet, to, the, cylinder, and, bottom, of, the, piston, that, nozzle, is, in, movement, relative, to, the, cylinder, it, lubricates, but, always, pointed, towards, it, or, the, corresponding, piston, typically, forced, lubrication, systems, have, a, lubricant, flow, higher, than, what, is, required, to, lubricate, satisfactorily, in, order, to, assist, with, cooling, specifically, the, lubricant, system, helps, to, move, heat, from, the, hot, engine, parts, to, the, cooling, liquid, in, water, cooled, engines, or, fins, in, air, cooled, engines, which, then, transfer, it, to, the, environment, the, lubricant, must, be, designed, to, be, chemically, stable, and, maintain, suitable, viscosities, within, the, temperature, range, it, encounters, in, the, engine, common, cylinder, configurations, include, the, straight, or, inline, configuration, the, more, compact, v, configuration, and, the, wider, but, smoother, flat, or, boxer, configuration, aircraft, engines, can, also, adopt, a, radial, configuration, which, allows, more, effective, cooling, more, unusual, configurations, such, as, the, h, u, x, and, w, have, also, been, used, multiple, cylinder, engines, have, their, valve, train, and, crankshaft, configured, so, that, pistons, are, at, different, parts, of, their, cycle, it, is, desirable, to, have, the, pistons, cycles, uniformly, spaced, this, is, called, even, firing, especially, in, forced, induction, engines, this, reduces, torque, pulsations, and, makes, inline, engines, with, more, than, 3, cylinders, statically, balanced, in, its, primary, forces, however, some, engine, configurations, require, odd, firing, to, achieve, better, balance, than, what, is, possible, with, even, firing, for, instance, a, 4, stroke, i2, engine, has, better, balance, when, the, angle, between, the, crankpins, is, 180, because, the, pistons, move, in, opposite, directions, and, inertial, forces, partially, cancel, but, this, gives, an, odd, firing, pattern, where, one, cylinder, fires, 180, of, crankshaft, rotation, after, the, other, then, no, cylinder, fires, for, 540, with, an, even, firing, pattern, the, pistons, would, move, in, unison, and, the, associated, forces, would, add, multiple, crankshaft, configurations, do, not, necessarily, need, a, cylinder, head, at, all, because, they, can, instead, have, a, piston, at, each, end, of, the, cylinder, called, an, opposed, piston, design, because, fuel, inlets, and, outlets, are, positioned, at, opposed, ends, of, the, cylinder, one, can, achieve, uniflow, scavenging, which, as, in, the, four, stroke, engine, is, efficient, over, a, wide, range, of, engine, speeds, thermal, efficiency, is, improved, because, of, a, lack, of, cylinder, heads, this, design, was, used, in, the, junkers, jumo, 205, diesel, aircraft, engine, using, two, crankshafts, at, either, end, of, a, single, bank, of, cylinders, and, most, remarkably, in, the, napier, deltic, diesel, engines, these, used, three, crankshafts, to, serve, three, banks, of, double, ended, cylinders, arranged, in, an, equilateral, triangle, with, the, crankshafts, at, the, corners, it, was, also, used, in, single, bank, locomotive, engines, and, is, still, used, in, marine, propulsion, engines, and, marine, auxiliary, generators, most, truck, and, automotive, diesel, engines, use, a, cycle, reminiscent, of, a, four, stroke, cycle, but, with, temperature, increase, by, compression, causing, ignition, rather, than, needing, a, separate, ignition, system, this, variation, is, called, the, diesel, cycle, in, the, diesel, cycle, diesel, fuel, is, injected, directly, into, the, cylinder, so, that, combustion, occurs, at, constant, pressure, as, the, piston, moves, the, otto, cycle, is, the, most, common, cycle, for, most, cars, internal, combustion, engines, that, use, gasoline, as, a, fuel, it, consists, of, the, same, major, steps, as, described, for, the, four, stroke, engine, intake, compression, ignition, expansion, and, exhaust, in, 1879, nicolaus, otto, manufactured, and, sold, a, double, expansion, engine, the, double, and, triple, expansion, principles, had, ample, usage, in, steam, engines, with, two, small, cylinders, at, both, sides, of, a, low, pressure, larger, cylinder, where, a, second, expansion, of, exhaust, stroke, gas, took, place, the, owner, returned, it, alleging, poor, performance, in, 1906, the, concept, was, incorporated, in, a, car, built, by, ehv, eisenhuth, horseless, vehicle, company, and, in, the, 21st, century, ilmor, designed, and, successfully, tested, a, 5, stroke, double, expansion, internal, combustion, engine, with, high, power, output, and, low, sfc, specific, fuel, consumption, the, six, stroke, engine, was, invented, in, 1883, four, kinds, of, six, stroke, engines, use, a, regular, piston, in, a, regular, cylinder, griffin, six, stroke, bajulaz, six, stroke, velozeta, six, stroke, and, crower, six, stroke, firing, every, three, crankshaft, revolutions, these, systems, capture, the, waste, heat, of, the, four, stroke, otto, cycle, with, an, injection, of, air, or, water, the, beare, head, and, piston, charger, engines, operate, as, opposed, piston, engines, two, pistons, in, a, single, cylinder, firing, every, two, revolutions, rather, than, every, four, like, a, four, stroke, engine, the, first, internal, combustion, engines, did, not, compress, the, mixture, the, first, part, of, the, piston, downstroke, drew, in, a, fuel, air, mixture, then, the, inlet, valve, closed, and, in, the, remainder, of, the, down, stroke, the, fuel, air, mixture, fired, the, exhaust, valve, opened, for, the, piston, upstroke, these, attempts, at, imitating, the, principle, of, a, steam, engine, were, very, inefficient, there, are, a, number, of, variations, of, these, cycles, most, notably, the, atkinson, and, miller, cycles, split, cycle, engines, separate, the, four, strokes, of, intake, compression, combustion, and, exhaust, into, two, separate, but, paired, cylinders, the, first, cylinder, is, used, for, intake, and, compression, the, compressed, air, is, then, transferred, through, a, crossover, passage, from, the, compression, cylinder, into, the, second, cylinder, where, combustion, and, exhaust, occur, a, split, cycle, engine, is, really, an, air, compressor, on, one, side, with, a, combustion, chamber, on, the, other, previous, split, cycle, engines, have, had, two, major, problems, poor, breathing, volumetric, efficiency, and, low, thermal, efficiency, however, new, designs, are, being, introduced, that, seek, to, address, these, problems, the, scuderi, engine, addresses, the, breathing, problem, by, reducing, the, clearance, between, the, piston, and, the, cylinder, head, through, various, turbocharging, techniques, the, scuderi, design, requires, the, use, of, outwardly, opening, valves, that, enable, the, piston, to, move, very, close, to, the, cylinder, head, without, the, interference, of, the, valves, scuderi, addresses, the, low, thermal, efficiency, via, firing, after, top, dead, center, atdc, firing, atdc, can, be, accomplished, by, using, high, pressure, air, in, the, transfer, passage, to, create, sonic, flow, and, high, turbulence, in, the, power, cylinder, jet, engines, use, a, number, of, rows, of, fan, blades, to, compress, air, which, then, enters, a, combustor, where, it, is, mixed, with, fuel, typically, jp, fuel, and, then, ignited, the, burning, of, the, fuel, raises, the, temperature, of, the, air, which, is, then, exhausted, out, of, the, engine, creating, thrust, a, modern, turbofan, engine, can, operate, at, as, high, as, 48, efficiency, there, are, six, sections, to, a, turbofan, engine, a, gas, turbine, compresses, air, and, uses, it, to, turn, a, turbine, it, is, essentially, a, jet, engine, which, directs, its, output, to, a, shaft, there, are, three, stages, to, a, turbine, 1, air, is, drawn, through, a, compressor, where, the, temperature, rises, due, to, compression, 2, fuel, is, added, in, the, combuster, and, 3, hot, air, is, exhausted, through, turbine, blades, which, rotate, a, shaft, connected, to, the, compressor, a, gas, turbine, is, a, rotary, machine, similar, in, principle, to, a, steam, turbine, and, it, consists, of, three, main, components, a, compressor, a, combustion, chamber, and, a, turbine, the, temperature, of, the, air, after, being, compressed, in, the, compressor, is, increased, by, burning, fuel, in, it, the, heated, air, and, the, products, of, combustion, expand, in, a, turbine, producing, work, output, about, 2, 3, of, the, work, drives, the, compressor, the, rest, about, 1, 3, is, available, as, useful, work, output, gas, turbines, are, among, the, most, efficient, internal, combustion, engines, the, general, electric, 7ha, and, 9ha, turbine, combined, cycle, electrical, plants, are, rated, at, over, 61, efficiency, a, gas, turbine, is, a, rotary, machine, somewhat, similar, in, principle, to, a, steam, turbine, it, consists, of, three, main, components, compressor, combustion, chamber, and, turbine, the, air, is, compressed, by, the, compressor, where, a, temperature, rise, occurs, the, temperature, of, the, compressed, air, is, further, increased, by, combustion, of, injected, fuel, in, the, combustion, chamber, which, expands, the, air, this, energy, rotates, the, turbine, which, powers, the, compressor, via, a, mechanical, coupling, the, hot, gases, are, then, exhausted, to, provide, thrust, gas, turbine, cycle, engines, employ, a, continuous, combustion, system, where, compression, combustion, and, expansion, occur, simultaneously, at, different, places, in, the, engine, giving, continuous, power, notably, the, combustion, takes, place, at, constant, pressure, rather, than, with, the, otto, cycle, constant, volume, the, wankel, engine, rotary, engine, does, not, have, piston, strokes, it, operates, with, the, same, separation, of, phases, as, the, four, stroke, engine, with, the, phases, taking, place, in, separate, locations, in, the, engine, in, thermodynamic, terms, it, follows, the, otto, engine, cycle, so, may, be, thought, of, as, a, four, phase, engine, while, it, is, true, that, three, power, strokes, typically, occur, per, rotor, revolution, due, to, the, 3, 1, revolution, ratio, of, the, rotor, to, the, eccentric, shaft, only, one, power, stroke, per, shaft, revolution, actually, occurs, the, drive, eccentric, shaft, rotates, once, during, every, power, stroke, instead, of, twice, crankshaft, as, in, the, otto, cycle, giving, it, a, greater, power, to, weight, ratio, than, piston, engines, this, type, of, engine, was, most, notably, used, in, the, mazda, rx, 8, the, earlier, rx, 7, and, other, vehicle, models, the, engine, is, also, used, in, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, where, the, small, size, and, weight, and, the, high, power, to, weight, ratio, are, advantageous, forced, induction, is, the, process, of, delivering, compressed, air, to, the, intake, of, an, internal, combustion, engine, a, forced, induction, engine, uses, a, gas, compressor, to, increase, the, pressure, temperature, and, density, of, the, air, an, engine, without, forced, induction, is, considered, a, naturally, aspirated, engine, forced, induction, is, used, in, the, automotive, and, aviation, industry, to, increase, engine, power, and, efficiency, it, particularly, helps, aviation, engines, as, they, need, to, operate, at, high, altitude, forced, induction, is, achieved, by, a, supercharger, where, the, compressor, is, directly, powered, from, the, engine, shaft, or, in, the, turbocharger, from, a, turbine, powered, by, the, engine, exhaust, all, internal, combustion, engines, depend, on, combustion, of, a, chemical, fuel, typically, with, oxygen, from, the, air, though, it, is, possible, to, inject, nitrous, oxide, to, do, more, of, the, same, thing, and, gain, a, power, boost, the, combustion, process, typically, results, in, the, production, of, a, great, quantity, of, thermal, energy, as, well, as, the, production, of, steam, and, carbon, dioxide, and, other, chemicals, at, very, high, temperature, the, temperature, reached, is, determined, by, the, chemical, make, up, of, the, fuel, and, oxidizers, see, stoichiometry, as, well, as, by, the, compression, and, other, factors, the, most, common, modern, fuels, are, made, up, of, hydrocarbons, and, are, derived, mostly, from, fossil, fuels, petroleum, fossil, fuels, include, diesel, fuel, gasoline, and, petroleum, gas, and, the, rarer, use, of, propane, except, for, the, fuel, delivery, components, most, internal, combustion, engines, that, are, designed, for, gasoline, use, can, run, on, natural, gas, or, liquefied, petroleum, gases, without, major, modifications, large, diesels, can, run, with, air, mixed, with, gases, and, a, pilot, diesel, fuel, ignition, injection, liquid, and, gaseous, biofuels, such, as, ethanol, and, biodiesel, a, form, of, diesel, fuel, that, is, produced, from, crops, that, yield, triglycerides, such, as, soybean, oil, can, also, be, used, engines, with, appropriate, modifications, can, also, run, on, hydrogen, gas, wood, gas, or, charcoal, gas, as, well, as, from, so, called, producer, gas, made, from, other, convenient, biomass, experiments, have, also, been, conducted, using, powdered, solid, fuels, such, as, the, magnesium, injection, cycle, presently, fuels, used, include, even, fluidized, metal, powders, and, explosives, have, seen, some, use, engines, that, use, gases, for, fuel, are, called, gas, engines, and, those, that, use, liquid, hydrocarbons, are, called, oil, engines, however, gasoline, engines, are, also, often, colloquially, referred, to, as, gas, engines, petrol, engines, outside, north, america, the, main, limitations, on, fuels, are, that, it, must, be, easily, transportable, through, the, fuel, system, to, the, combustion, chamber, and, that, the, fuel, releases, sufficient, energy, in, the, form, of, heat, upon, combustion, to, make, practical, use, of, the, engine, diesel, engines, are, generally, heavier, noisier, and, more, powerful, at, lower, speeds, than, gasoline, engines, they, are, also, more, fuel, efficient, in, most, circumstances, and, are, used, in, heavy, road, vehicles, some, automobiles, increasingly, so, for, their, increased, fuel, efficiency, over, gasoline, engines, ships, railway, locomotives, and, light, aircraft, gasoline, engines, are, used, in, most, other, road, vehicles, including, most, cars, motorcycles, and, mopeds, in, europe, sophisticated, diesel, engined, cars, have, taken, over, about, 45, of, the, market, since, the, 1990s, there, are, also, engines, that, run, on, hydrogen, methanol, ethanol, liquefied, petroleum, gas, lpg, biodiesel, paraffin, and, tractor, vaporizing, oil, tvo, hydrogen, could, eventually, replace, conventional, fossil, fuels, in, traditional, internal, combustion, engines, alternatively, fuel, cell, technology, may, come, to, deliver, its, promise, and, the, use, of, the, internal, combustion, engines, could, even, be, phased, out, although, there, are, multiple, ways, of, producing, free, hydrogen, those, methods, require, converting, combustible, molecules, into, hydrogen, or, consuming, electric, energy, unless, that, electricity, is, produced, from, a, renewable, source, and, is, not, required, for, other, purposes, hydrogen, does, not, solve, any, energy, crisis, in, many, situations, the, disadvantage, of, hydrogen, relative, to, carbon, fuels, is, its, storage, liquid, hydrogen, has, extremely, low, density, 14, times, lower, than, water, and, requires, extensive, insulation, whilst, gaseous, hydrogen, requires, heavy, tankage, even, when, liquefied, hydrogen, has, a, higher, specific, energy, but, the, volumetric, energetic, storage, is, still, roughly, five, times, lower, than, gasoline, however, the, energy, density, of, hydrogen, is, considerably, higher, than, that, of, electric, batteries, making, it, a, serious, contender, as, an, energy, carrier, to, replace, fossil, fuels, the, hydrogen, on, demand, process, see, direct, borohydride, fuel, cell, creates, hydrogen, as, needed, but, has, other, issues, such, as, the, high, price, of, the, sodium, borohydride, that, is, the, raw, material, since, air, is, plentiful, at, the, surface, of, the, earth, the, oxidizer, is, typically, atmospheric, oxygen, which, has, the, advantage, of, not, being, stored, within, the, vehicle, this, increases, the, power, to, weight, and, power, to, volume, ratios, other, materials, are, used, for, special, purposes, often, to, increase, power, output, or, to, allow, operation, under, water, or, in, space, cooling, is, required, to, remove, excessive, heat, high, temperature, can, cause, engine, failure, usually, from, wear, due, to, high, temperature, induced, failure, of, lubrication, cracking, or, warping, two, most, common, forms, of, engine, cooling, are, air, cooled, and, water, cooled, most, modern, automotive, engines, are, both, water, and, air, cooled, as, the, water, liquid, coolant, is, carried, to, air, cooled, fins, and, or, fans, whereas, larger, engines, may, be, singularly, water, cooled, as, they, are, stationary, and, have, a, constant, supply, of, water, through, water, mains, or, fresh, water, while, most, power, tool, engines, and, other, small, engines, are, air, cooled, some, engines, air, or, water, cooled, also, have, an, oil, cooler, in, some, engines, especially, for, turbine, engine, blade, cooling, and, liquid, rocket, engine, cooling, fuel, is, used, as, a, coolant, as, it, is, simultaneously, preheated, before, injecting, it, into, a, combustion, chamber, internal, combustion, engines, must, have, their, cycles, started, in, reciprocating, engines, this, is, accomplished, by, turning, the, crankshaft, wankel, rotor, shaft, which, induces, the, cycles, of, intake, compression, combustion, and, exhaust, the, first, engines, were, started, with, a, turn, of, their, flywheels, while, the, first, vehicle, the, daimler, reitwagen, was, started, with, a, hand, crank, all, ice, engined, automobiles, were, started, with, hand, cranks, until, charles, kettering, developed, the, electric, starter, for, automobiles, this, method, is, now, the, most, widely, used, even, among, non, automobiles, as, diesel, engines, have, become, larger, and, their, mechanisms, heavier, air, starters, have, come, into, use, this, is, due, to, the, lack, of, torque, in, electric, starters, air, starters, work, by, pumping, compressed, air, into, the, cylinders, of, an, engine, to, start, it, turning, two, wheeled, vehicles, may, have, their, engines, started, in, one, of, four, ways, there, are, also, starters, where, a, spring, is, compressed, by, a, crank, motion, and, then, used, to, start, an, engine, some, small, engines, use, a, pull, rope, mechanism, called, recoil, starting, as, the, rope, rewinds, itself, after, it, has, been, pulled, out, to, start, the, engine, this, method, is, commonly, used, in, pushed, lawn, mowers, and, other, settings, where, only, a, small, amount, of, torque, is, needed, to, turn, an, engine, over, turbine, engines, are, frequently, started, by, an, electric, motor, or, by, compressed, air, engine, types, vary, greatly, in, a, number, of, different, ways, once, ignited, and, burnt, the, combustion, products, hot, gases, have, more, available, thermal, energy, than, the, original, compressed, fuel, air, mixture, which, had, higher, chemical, energy, this, available, energy, is, manifested, as, a, higher, temperature, and, pressure, that, can, be, converted, into, kinetic, energy, by, the, engine, in, a, reciprocating, engine, the, high, pressure, gases, inside, the, cylinders, drive, the, engine, s, pistons, once, the, available, energy, has, been, removed, the, remaining, hot, gases, are, vented, often, by, opening, a, valve, or, exposing, the, exhaust, outlet, and, this, allows, the, piston, to, return, to, its, previous, position, top, dead, center, or, tdc, the, piston, can, then, proceed, to, the, next, phase, of, its, cycle, which, varies, between, engines, any, thermal, energy, that, is, not, translated, into, work, is, normally, considered, a, waste, product, and, is, removed, from, the, engine, either, by, an, air, or, liquid, cooling, system, internal, combustion, engines, are, considered, heat, engines, since, the, release, of, chemical, energy, in, combustion, has, the, same, effect, as, heat, transfer, into, the, engine, and, as, such, their, theoretical, efficiency, can, be, approximated, by, idealized, thermodynamic, cycles, the, thermal, efficiency, of, a, theoretical, cycle, cannot, exceed, that, of, the, carnot, cycle, whose, efficiency, is, determined, by, the, difference, between, the, lower, and, upper, operating, temperatures, of, the, engine, the, upper, operating, temperature, of, an, engine, is, limited, by, two, main, factors, the, thermal, operating, limits, of, the, materials, and, the, auto, ignition, resistance, of, the, fuel, all, metals, and, alloys, have, a, thermal, operating, limit, and, there, is, significant, research, into, ceramic, materials, that, can, be, made, with, greater, thermal, stability, and, desirable, structural, properties, higher, thermal, stability, allows, for, a, greater, temperature, difference, between, the, lower, ambient, and, upper, operating, temperatures, hence, greater, thermodynamic, efficiency, also, as, the, cylinder, temperature, rises, the, fuel, becomes, more, prone, to, auto, ignition, this, is, caused, when, the, cylinder, temperature, nears, the, flash, point, of, the, charge, at, this, point, ignition, can, spontaneously, occur, before, the, spark, plug, fires, causing, excessive, cylinder, pressures, auto, ignition, can, be, mitigated, by, using, fuels, with, high, auto, ignition, resistance, octane, rating, however, it, still, puts, an, upper, bound, on, the, allowable, peak, cylinder, temperature, the, thermodynamic, limits, assume, that, the, engine, is, operating, under, ideal, conditions, a, frictionless, world, ideal, gases, perfect, insulators, and, operation, for, infinite, time, real, world, applications, introduce, complexities, that, reduce, efficiency, for, example, a, real, engine, runs, best, at, a, specific, load, termed, its, power, band, the, engine, in, a, car, cruising, on, a, highway, is, usually, operating, significantly, below, its, ideal, load, because, it, is, designed, for, the, higher, loads, required, for, rapid, acceleration, in, addition, factors, such, as, wind, resistance, reduce, overall, system, efficiency, vehicle, fuel, economy, is, measured, in, miles, per, gallon, or, in, liters, per, 100, kilometers, the, volume, of, hydrocarbon, assumes, a, standard, energy, content, even, when, aided, with, turbochargers, and, stock, efficiency, aids, most, engines, retain, an, average, efficiency, of, about, 18, 20, however, the, latest, technologies, in, formula, one, engines, have, seen, a, boost, in, thermal, efficiency, past, 50, there, are, many, inventions, aimed, at, increasing, the, efficiency, of, ic, engines, in, general, practical, engines, are, always, compromised, by, trade, offs, between, different, properties, such, as, efficiency, weight, power, heat, response, exhaust, emissions, or, noise, sometimes, economy, also, plays, a, role, in, not, only, the, cost, of, manufacturing, the, engine, itself, but, also, manufacturing, and, distributing, the, fuel, increasing, the, engine, s, efficiency, brings, better, fuel, economy, but, only, if, the, fuel, cost, per, energy, content, is, the, same, for, stationary, and, shaft, engines, including, propeller, engines, fuel, consumption, is, measured, by, calculating, the, brake, specific, fuel, consumption, which, measures, the, mass, flow, rate, of, fuel, consumption, divided, by, the, power, produced, for, internal, combustion, engines, in, the, form, of, jet, engines, the, power, output, varies, drastically, with, airspeed, and, a, less, variable, measure, is, used, thrust, specific, fuel, consumption, tsfc, which, is, the, mass, of, propellant, needed, to, generate, impulses, that, is, measured, in, either, pound, force, hour, or, the, grams, of, propellant, needed, to, generate, an, impulse, that, measures, one, kilonewton, second, for, rockets, tsfc, can, be, used, but, typically, other, equivalent, measures, are, traditionally, used, such, as, specific, impulse, and, effective, exhaust, velocity, internal, combustion, engines, such, as, reciprocating, internal, combustion, engines, produce, air, pollution, emissions, due, to, incomplete, combustion, of, carbonaceous, fuel, the, main, derivatives, of, the, process, are, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, water, and, some, soot, also, called, particulate, matter, pm, the, effects, of, inhaling, particulate, matter, have, been, studied, in, humans, and, animals, and, include, asthma, lung, cancer, cardiovascular, issues, and, premature, death, there, are, however, some, additional, products, of, the, combustion, process, that, include, nitrogen, oxides, and, sulfur, and, some, uncombusted, hydrocarbons, depending, on, the, operating, conditions, and, the, fuel, air, ratio, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, internal, combustion, engines, particularly, ones, using, fossil, fuels, such, as, gasoline, and, diesel, contribute, to, human, induced, climate, change, increasing, the, engine, s, fuel, efficiency, can, reduce, but, not, eliminate, the, amount, of, co, 2, emissions, as, carbon, based, fuel, combustion, produces, co, 2, since, removing, co, 2, from, engine, exhaust, is, impractical, there, is, increasing, interest, in, alternatives, sustainable, fuels, such, as, biofuels, synfuels, and, electric, motors, powered, by, batteries, are, examples, not, all, of, the, fuel, is, completely, consumed, by, the, combustion, process, a, small, amount, of, fuel, is, present, after, combustion, and, some, of, it, reacts, to, form, oxygenates, such, as, formaldehyde, or, acetaldehyde, or, hydrocarbons, not, originally, present, in, the, input, fuel, mixture, incomplete, combustion, usually, results, from, insufficient, oxygen, to, achieve, the, perfect, stoichiometric, ratio, the, flame, is, quenched, by, the, relatively, cool, cylinder, walls, leaving, behind, unreacted, fuel, that, is, expelled, with, the, exhaust, when, running, at, lower, speeds, quenching, is, commonly, observed, in, diesel, compression, ignition, engines, that, run, on, natural, gas, quenching, reduces, efficiency, and, increases, knocking, sometimes, causing, the, engine, to, stall, incomplete, combustion, also, leads, to, the, production, of, carbon, monoxide, co, further, chemicals, released, are, benzene, and, 1, 3, butadiene, that, are, also, hazardous, air, pollutants, increasing, the, amount, of, air, in, the, engine, reduces, emissions, of, incomplete, combustion, products, but, also, promotes, reaction, between, oxygen, and, nitrogen, in, the, air, to, produce, nitrogen, oxides, no, x, no, x, is, hazardous, to, both, plant, and, animal, health, and, leads, to, the, production, of, ozone, o, 3, ozone, is, not, emitted, directly, rather, it, is, a, secondary, air, pollutant, produced, in, the, atmosphere, by, the, reaction, of, no, x, and, volatile, organic, compounds, in, the, presence, of, sunlight, ground, level, ozone, is, harmful, to, human, health, and, the, environment, though, the, same, chemical, substance, ground, level, ozone, should, not, be, confused, with, stratospheric, ozone, or, the, ozone, layer, which, protects, the, earth, from, harmful, ultraviolet, rays, carbon, fuels, containing, sulfur, produce, sulfur, monoxides, so, and, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, contributing, to, acid, rain, in, the, united, states, nitrogen, oxides, pm, carbon, monoxide, sulfur, dioxide, and, ozone, are, regulated, as, criteria, air, pollutants, under, the, clean, air, act, to, levels, where, human, health, and, welfare, are, protected, other, pollutants, such, as, benzene, and, 1, 3, butadiene, are, regulated, as, hazardous, air, pollutants, whose, emissions, must, be, lowered, as, much, as, possible, depending, on, technological, and, practical, considerations, no, x, carbon, monoxide, and, other, pollutants, are, frequently, controlled, via, exhaust, gas, recirculation, which, returns, some, of, the, exhaust, back, into, the, engine, intake, catalytic, converters, are, used, to, convert, exhaust, chemicals, to, co, 2, a, greenhouse, gas, h, 2, o, water, vapour, also, a, greenhouse, gas, and, n, 2, nitrogen, the, emission, standards, used, by, many, countries, have, special, requirements, for, non, road, engines, which, are, used, by, equipment, and, vehicles, that, are, not, operated, on, the, public, roadways, the, standards, are, separated, from, the, road, vehicles, significant, contributions, to, noise, pollution, are, made, by, internal, combustion, engines, automobile, and, truck, traffic, operating, on, highways, and, street, systems, produce, noise, as, do, aircraft, flights, due, to, jet, noise, particularly, supersonic, capable, aircraft, rocket, engines, create, the, most, intense, noise, internal, combustion, engines, continue, to, consume, fuel, and, emit, pollutants, while, idling, idling, is, reduced, by, stop, start, systems, a, good, way, to, estimate, the, mass, of, carbon, dioxide, that, is, released, when, one, litre, of, diesel, fuel, or, gasoline, is, combusted, can, be, found, as, follows, as, a, good, approximation, the, chemical, formula, of, diesel, is, c, n, h, 2n, in, reality, diesel, is, a, mixture, of, different, molecules, as, carbon, has, a, molar, mass, of, 12, g, mol, and, hydrogen, atomic, has, a, molar, mass, of, about, 1, g, mol, the, fraction, by, weight, of, carbon, in, diesel, is, roughly, 12, 14, the, reaction, of, diesel, combustion, is, given, by, 2, c, n, h, 2n, 3n, o, 2, 2n, co, 2, 2n, h, 2, o, carbon, dioxide, has, a, molar, mass, of, 44, g, mol, as, it, consists, of, 2, atoms, of, oxygen, 16, g, mol, and, 1, atom, of, carbon, 12, g, mol, so, 12, g, of, carbon, yields, 44, g, of, carbon, dioxide, diesel, has, a, density, of, 0, 838, kg, per, litre, putting, everything, together, the, mass, of, carbon, dioxide, that, is, produced, by, burning, 1, litre, of, diesel, can, be, calculated, as, 0, 838, k, g, l, 12, 14, 44, 12, 2, 63, k, g, l, displaystyle, 0, 838kg, l, cdot, frac, 12, 14, cdot, frac, 44, 12, 2, 63kg, l, the, figure, obtained, with, this, estimation, is, close, to, the, values, found, in, the, literature, for, gasoline, with, a, density, of, 0, 75, kg, l, and, a, ratio, of, carbon, to, hydrogen, atoms, of, about, 6, to, 14, the, estimated, value, of, carbon, dioxide, emission, from, burning, 1, litre, of, gasoline, is, 0, 75, k, g, l, 6, 12, 6, 12, 14, 1, 44, 12, 2, 3, k, g, l, displaystyle, 0, 75kg, l, cdot, frac, 6, cdot, 12, 6, cdot, 12, 14, cdot, 1, cdot, frac, 44, 12, 2, 3kg, l, the, term, parasitic, loss, is, often, applied, to, devices, that, take, energy, from, the, engine, in, order, to, enhance, the, engine, s, ability, to, create, more, energy, or, convert, energy, to, motion, in, the, internal, combustion, engine, almost, every, mechanical, component, including, the, drivetrain, causes, parasitic, loss, and, could, thus, be, characterized, as, a, parasitic, load, bearings, oil, pumps, piston, rings, valve, springs, flywheels, transmissions, driveshafts, and, differentials, all, act, as, parasitic, loads, that, rob, the, system, of, power, these, parasitic, loads, can, be, divided, into, two, categories, those, inherent, to, the, working, of, the, engine, and, those, drivetrain, losses, incurred, in, the, systems, that, transfer, power, from, the, engine, to, the, road, such, as, the, transmission, driveshaft, differentials, and, axles, for, example, the, former, category, engine, parasitic, loads, includes, the, oil, pump, used, to, lubricate, the, engine, which, is, a, necessary, parasite, that, consumes, power, from, the, engine, its, host, another, example, of, an, engine, parasitic, load, is, a, supercharger, which, derives, its, power, from, the, engine, and, creates, more, power, for, the, engine, the, power, that, the, supercharger, consumes, is, parasitic, loss, and, is, usually, expressed, in, kilowatt, or, horsepower, while, the, power, that, the, supercharger, consumes, in, comparison, to, what, it, generates, is, small, it, is, still, measurable, or, calculable, one, of, the, desirable, features, of, a, turbocharger, over, a, supercharger, is, the, lower, parasitic, loss, of, the, former, drivetrain, parasitic, losses, include, both, steady, state, and, dynamic, loads, steady, state, loads, occur, at, constant, speeds, and, may, originate, in, discrete, components, such, as, the, torque, converter, the, transmission, oil, pump, and, or, clutch, drag, and, in, seal, bearing, drag, churning, of, lubricant, and, gear, windage, friction, found, throughout, the, system, dynamic, loads, occur, under, acceleration, and, are, caused, by, inertia, of, rotating, components, and, or, increased, friction, while, rules, of, thumb, such, as, a, 15, power, loss, from, drivetrain, parasitic, loads, have, been, commonly, repeated, the, actual, loss, of, energy, due, to, parasitic, loads, varies, between, systems, it, can, be, influenced, by, powertrain, design, lubricant, type, and, temperature, and, many, other, factors, in, automobiles, drivetrain, loss, can, be, quantified, by, measuring, the, difference, between, power, measured, by, an, engine, dynamometer, and, a, chassis, dynamometer, however, this, method, is, primarily, useful, for, measuring, steady, state, loads, and, may, not, accurately, reflect, losses, due, to, dynamic, loads, more, advanced, methods, can, be, used, in, a, laboratory, setting, such, as, measuring, in, cylinder, pressure, measurements, flow, rate, and, temperature, at, certain, points, and, testing, of, individual, parts, or, sub, assemblies, to, determine, friction, and, pumping, losses, for, example, in, a, dynamometer, test, by, hot, rod, magazine, a, ford, mustang, equipped, with, a, modified, 357ci, small, block, ford, v8, engine, and, an, automatic, transmission, had, a, measured, drivetrain, power, loss, averaging, 33, in, the, same, test, a, buick, equipped, with, a, modified, 455ci, v8, engine, and, a, 4, speed, manual, transmission, was, measured, to, have, an, average, drivetrain, power, loss, of, 21, laboratory, testing, of, a, heavy, duty, diesel, engine, determined, that, 1, 3, of, the, fuel, energy, input, was, lost, to, parasitic, loads, of, engine, accessories, such, as, water, and, oil, pumps, automotive, engineers, and, tuners, commonly, make, design, choices, that, reduce, parasitic, loads, in, order, to, improve, efficiency, and, power, output, these, may, involve, the, choice, of, major, engine, components, or, systems, such, as, the, use, of, dry, sump, lubrication, system, over, a, wet, sump, system, alternately, this, can, be, effected, through, substitution, of, minor, components, available, as, aftermarket, modifications, such, as, exchanging, a, directly, engine, driven, fan, for, one, equipped, with, a, fan, clutch, or, an, electric, fan, another, modification, to, reduce, parasitic, loss, usually, seen, in, track, only, cars, is, the, replacement, of, an, engine, driven, water, pump, for, an, electrical, water, pump, the, reduction, in, parasitic, loss, from, these, changes, may, be, due, to, reduced, friction, or, many, other, variables, that, cause, the, design, to, be, more, efficient
