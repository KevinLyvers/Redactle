a, sickle, bagging, hook, reaping, hook, or, grasshook, is, a, single, handed, agricultural, tool, designed, with, variously, curved, blades, and, typically, used, for, harvesting, or, reaping, grain, crops, or, cutting, succulent, forage, chiefly, for, feeding, livestock, falx, was, a, synonym, but, was, later, used, to, mean, any, of, a, number, of, tools, that, had, a, curved, blade, that, was, sharp, on, the, inside, edge, since, the, beginning, of, the, iron, age, hundreds, of, region, specific, variants, of, the, sickle, have, evolved, initially, of, iron, and, later, steel, this, great, diversity, of, sickle, types, across, many, cultures, can, be, divided, into, smooth, or, serrated, blades, both, of, which, can, be, used, for, cutting, either, green, grass, or, mature, cereals, using, slightly, different, techniques, the, serrated, blade, that, originated, in, prehistoric, sickles, still, dominates, in, the, reaping, of, grain, and, is, even, found, in, modern, grain, harvesting, machines, and, in, some, kitchen, knives, the, development, of, the, sickle, in, mesopotamia, can, be, traced, back, to, times, that, pre, date, the, neolithic, era, large, quantities, of, sickle, blades, have, been, excavated, in, sites, surrounding, israel, that, have, been, dated, to, the, epipaleolithic, era, 18000, 8000, bc, formal, digs, in, wadi, ziqlab, jordan, have, unearthed, various, forms, of, early, sickle, blades, the, artifacts, recovered, ranged, from, 10, 20, cm, 3, 9, 7, 9, in, in, length, and, possessed, a, jagged, edge, this, intricate, tooth, like, design, showed, a, greater, degree, of, design, and, manufacturing, credence, than, most, of, the, other, artifacts, that, were, discovered, sickle, blades, found, during, this, time, were, made, of, flint, straight, and, used, in, more, of, a, sawing, motion, than, with, the, more, modern, curved, design, flints, from, these, sickles, have, been, discovered, near, mt, carmel, which, suggest, the, harvesting, of, grains, from, the, area, about, 10, 000, years, ago, the, sickle, had, a, profound, impact, on, the, agricultural, revolution, by, assisting, in, the, transition, to, farming, and, crop, based, lifestyle, it, is, now, accepted, that, the, use, of, sickles, led, directly, to, the, domestication, of, near, eastern, wild, grasses, research, on, domestication, rates, of, wild, cereals, under, primitive, cultivation, found, that, the, use, of, the, sickle, in, harvesting, was, critical, to, the, people, of, early, mesopotamia, the, relatively, narrow, growing, season, in, the, area, and, the, critical, role, of, grain, in, the, late, neolithic, era, promoted, a, larger, investment, in, the, design, and, manufacture, of, sickle, over, other, tools, standardization, to, an, extent, was, done, on, the, measurements, of, the, sickle, so, that, replacement, or, repair, could, be, more, immediate, it, was, important, that, the, grain, be, harvested, at, the, appropriate, time, at, one, elevation, so, that, the, next, elevation, could, be, reaped, at, the, proper, time, the, sickle, provided, a, more, efficient, option, in, collecting, the, grain, and, significantly, sped, up, the, developments, of, early, agriculture, the, sickle, remained, common, in, the, bronze, age, both, in, the, ancient, near, east, and, in, europe, numerous, sickles, have, been, found, deposited, in, hoards, in, the, context, of, the, european, urnfield, culture, e, g, frankleben, hoard, suggesting, a, symbolic, or, religious, significance, attached, to, the, artifact, in, archaeological, terminology, bronze, age, sickles, are, classified, by, the, method, of, attaching, the, handle, e, g, the, knob, sickle, german, knopfsichel, is, so, called, because, of, a, protruding, knob, at, the, base, of, the, blade, which, apparently, served, to, stabilize, the, attachment, of, the, blade, to, the, handle, the, sickle, played, a, prominent, role, in, the, druids, ritual, of, oak, and, mistletoe, as, described, from, a, single, passage, in, pliny, the, elder, s, natural, history, a, priest, arrayed, in, white, vestments, climbs, the, tree, and, with, a, golden, sickle, cuts, down, the, mistletoe, which, is, caught, in, a, white, cloak, then, finally, they, kill, the, victims, praying, to, a, god, to, render, his, gift, propitious, to, those, on, whom, he, has, bestowed, it, they, believe, that, mistletoe, given, in, drink, will, impart, fertility, to, any, animal, that, is, barren, and, that, it, is, an, antidote, to, all, poisons, due, to, this, passage, despite, the, fact, that, pliny, does, not, indicate, the, source, on, which, he, based, this, account, some, branches, of, modern, druidry, neodruids, have, adopted, the, sickle, as, a, ritual, tool, indigenous, sickles, have, been, discovered, in, southwest, north, america, with, unique, design, there, is, evidence, that, kodiak, islanders, had, for, cutting, grass, sickles, made, of, a, sharpened, animal, shoulder, blade, the, artifacts, found, in, present, day, arizona, and, new, mexico, resemble, curved, tools, that, were, made, from, the, horns, of, mountain, sheep, a, similar, site, discovered, sickles, made, from, other, material, such, as, the, caddo, sickle, which, was, made, from, a, deer, mandible, scripture, from, early, natives, document, the, use, of, these, sickles, in, the, cutting, of, grass, the, instruments, ranged, 13, 16, in, 330, 410, mm, from, tip, to, haft, several, other, digs, in, eastern, arizona, uncovered, wooden, sickles, that, were, shaped, in, a, similar, fashion, the, handles, of, the, tools, help, describe, how, the, tool, was, held, in, such, a, way, so, that, the, inner, portion, that, contained, the, cutting, surface, could, also, serve, as, a, gathering, surface, for, the, grain, sickles, were, sharpened, by, scraping, a, shape, beveled, edge, with, a, coarse, tool, this, action, has, left, marks, on, artifacts, that, have, been, found, the, sharpening, process, was, necessary, to, keep, the, cutting, edge, from, being, dulled, after, extended, use, the, edge, is, seen, to, be, quite, highly, polished, which, in, part, proves, that, the, instrument, was, used, to, cut, grass, after, collection, the, grass, was, used, as, material, to, create, matting, and, bedding, the, sickle, in, general, provided, the, convenience, of, cutting, the, grass, as, well, as, gathering, in, one, step, in, modern, times, the, sickle, is, being, used, in, south, america, as, tool, to, harvest, rice, rice, clusters, are, harvested, using, the, instrument, and, left, to, dry, in, the, sun, called, hasiya, or, aasi, a, sickle, is, very, common, in, nepal, as, the, most, important, tool, for, cutting, used, in, the, kitchen, and, in, the, fields, hasiya, is, used, in, the, kitchen, in, many, villages, of, nepal, where, its, used, to, cut, vegetables, during, food, prep, the, handle, of, hasiya, made, of, wood, is, held, pressed, by, the, toe, of, one, s, foot, and, the, curve, inverted, so, vegetables, can, be, cut, with, two, hands, while, rocking, the, vegetable, outside, of, home, hasiya, is, used, for, harvesting, hasiya, have, traditionally, been, made, by, local, blacksmiths, in, their, charcoal, foundries, that, use, leather, bellows, to, blow, air, sharpening, of, the, hasiya, is, done, by, rubbing, the, edges, against, a, smooth, rock, or, taken, back, to, the, blacksmith, sharpening, of, the, hasiya, is, generally, done, during, the, beginning, of, the, harvesting, season, bigger, hasiya, is, called, khurpa, or, khoorpa, where, the, curve, is, less, pronounced, is, much, heavier, and, is, used, to, sever, branches, of, trees, with, leaves, for, animal, feed, chop, meat, etc, the, famous, nepali, khukuri, is, also, a, type, of, sickle, where, the, curve, becomes, least, visible, carrying, around, a, sharp, and, naked, hasiya, or, khurpa, is, unsafe, so, nepalis, have, traditionally, built, a, cover, holder, for, it, called, khurpeto, meaning, khurpa, holder, in, nepali, it, could, be, a, simple, piece, of, wood, with, a, hole, big, enough, to, slide, the, blade, of, hasiya, inside, or, could, be, an, intricately, carved, piece, of, round, wood, slung, around, one, s, waist, with, a, string, made, of, plants, called, hatteuri, nowadays, though, many, use, cotton, jute, or, even, cloth, strings, as, a, replacement, of, hatteuri, which, is, not, easy, to, find, the, genealogy, of, sickles, with, serrated, edge, reaches, back, to, the, stone, age, when, individual, pieces, of, flint, were, first, attached, to, a, blade, body, of, wood, or, bone, the, majority, among, the, well, documented, specimens, made, later, of, bronze, are, smooth, edged, nevertheless, teeth, have, been, cut, with, hand, held, chisels, into, iron, and, later, steel, bladed, sickles, for, a, long, time, in, many, countries, on, the, african, continent, central, and, south, america, as, well, as, the, near, middle, and, far, east, this, is, still, the, case, in, the, regions, within, these, large, geographies, where, the, traditional, village, blacksmith, remains, alive, and, well, england, appears, to, have, been, the, first, to, develop, the, industrial, process, of, serration, making, then, by, 1897, the, redtenbacher, company, of, scharnstein, in, austria, at, that, time, the, largest, scythe, maker, in, the, world, designed, its, own, machine, for, the, job, becoming, the, only, austrian, source, of, serrated, sickles, in, 1942, its, recently, acquired, sister, company, krenhof, also, began, to, produce, these, in, 1970, a, year, before, the, sickle, production, branch, of, redtenbacher, was, sold, to, ethiopia, they, were, still, making, 1, 5, million, of, the, serrated, sickles, per, year, predominately, for, market, in, africa, and, latin, america, there, were, other, enterprises, in, austria, of, course, who, produced, the, smoothed, edged, sickles, for, centuries, the, last, of, the, classical, round, versions, were, forged, until, the, mid, 1980s, and, machined, until, 2002, while, in, central, europe, the, smooth, edged, sickle, either, forged, or, machined, alternately, referred, to, as, stamped, has, been, the, only, one, used, and, in, many, regions, the, only, one, known, the, iberian, peninsula, sicily, and, greece, long, had, fans, of, both, camps, the, many, small, family, owned, enterprises, in, what, is, now, italy, portugal, and, spain, produced, sickles, in, both, versions, with, the, teeth, on, the, serrated, models, being, hand, cut, one, at, a, time, until, the, mid, 20th, century, the, falci, co, of, italy, established, in, 1921, as, a, union, of, several, formerly, independent, forges, developed, its, own, unique, method, of, industrial, scale, serrated, sickle, production, in, 1965, their, innovations, which, included, tapered, blade, cross, section, thicker, at, the, back, for, strength, gradually, thinning, towards, the, edge, for, ease, of, penetration, were, later, adopted, by, europe, s, largest, sickle, producer, in, spain, as, well, as, more, recently, a, company, in, india, the, inside, of, the, blade, s, curve, is, sharp, so, that, the, user, can, either, draw, or, swing, it, against, the, base, of, the, crop, catching, the, stems, in, the, curve, and, slicing, them, at, the, same, time, the, material, to, be, cut, may, be, held, in, a, bunch, in, the, other, hand, for, example, when, reaping, held, in, place, by, a, wooden, stick, or, left, free, when, held, in, a, bunch, the, sickle, action, is, typically, towards, the, user, left, to, right, for, a, right, handed, user, but, when, used, free, the, sickle, is, usually, swung, the, opposite, way, other, colloquial, regional, names, for, principally, the, same, tool, are, grasshook, swap, hook, rip, hook, slash, hook, reaping, hook, brishing, hook, or, bagging, hook, a, serrated, sickle, was, used, for, harvesting, wheat, the, ears, being, held, bunched, up, in, the, free, hand, as, described, above, after, this, the, straw, was, cut, with, a, scythe, oats, and, barley, on, the, other, hand, were, simply, scythed, the, reason, for, this, is, that, wheat, straw, unlike, that, of, oats, or, barley, whose, softer, straw, was, suitable, only, for, bedding, or, fodder, was, a, valuable, crop, used, for, thatching, and, subjecting, it, to, the, battering, of, a, flail, would, have, rendered, it, useless, for, this, purpose, the, blades, of, sickle, models, intended, primarily, for, the, cutting, of, grass, are, sometimes, cranked, meaning, they, are, off, set, downwards, from, the, handle, which, makes, it, easier, to, keep, the, blade, closer, to, the, ground, sickles, used, for, reaping, do, not, benefit, by, this, feature, because, cereals, are, usually, not, cut, as, close, to, the, ground, surface, instead, what, distinguishes, this, latter, group, is, their, often, though, not, always, serrated, edges, a, blade, which, is, used, regularly, to, cut, the, silica, rich, stems, of, cereal, crops, acquires, a, characteristic, sickle, gloss, or, wear, pattern, like, other, farming, tools, the, sickle, can, be, used, as, an, improvised, bladed, weapon, examples, include, the, japanese, kusarigama, and, kama, the, chinese, chicken, sickles, and, the, makraka, of, the, zande, people, of, north, central, africa, paulus, hector, mair, the, author, of, a, german, renaissance, combat, manual, also, has, a, chapter, about, fighting, with, sickles, it, is, particularly, prevalent, in, the, martial, arts, of, malaysia, indonesia, and, the, philippines, in, indonesia, the, native, sickle, known, as, celurit, or, clurit, is, commonly, associated, with, the, madurese, people, used, for, both, fighting, and, as, a, domestic, tool, a, bagging, hook, badging, hook, fagging, hook, reap, hook, or, rip, hook, is, a, large, sickle, usually, with, an, offset, handle, so, that, the, user, s, knuckles, do, not, make, contact, with, the, ground, the, oxford, dictionary, gives, the, definition, of, the, word, to, bag, or, badge, as, the, cutting, of, grain, by, hand, the, blade, is, heavier, than, that, of, a, normal, sickle, and, always, without, serrated, blades, it, is, usually, about, 40, mm, 1, 6, in, wide, with, an, open, crescent, shaped, blade, approx, 45, cm, 18, in, across, it, developed, from, the, sickle, in, most, parts, of, britain, during, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, and, was, in, turn, replaced, by, the, scythe, later, by, the, reaping, machine, and, subsequently, the, swather, it, was, still, used, when, the, corn, was, bent, over, or, flattened, and, the, mechanical, reaper, was, unable, to, cut, without, causing, the, grain, to, fall, from, the, ears, and, wasting, the, crop, it, was, also, used, in, lieu, of, the, bean, hook, or, pea, hook, for, cutting, field, beans, and, other, leguminous, crops, that, were, used, for, fodder, and, bedding, for, livestock, sometimes, confused, with, the, heavier, and, straighter, billhook, used, for, cutting, wood, or, laying, hedges, while, the, scythe, or, bagging, hook, blade, was, heavy, enough, to, remove, young, growth, instead, of, say, shears, for, clipping, a, hedge, it, was, not, strong, enough, to, cut, woody, material, for, which, the, stronger, similarly, shaped, but, longer, handled, staff, hook, was, used, many, variations, in, blade, shape, were, used, in, different, parts, of, england, and, known, under, a, variety, of, names, its, close, relations, in, shape, and, usage, are, the, grass, hook, and, the, reap, hook
