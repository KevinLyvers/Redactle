petrochemicals, sometimes, abbreviated, as, petchems, are, the, chemical, products, obtained, from, petroleum, by, refining, some, chemical, compounds, made, from, petroleum, are, also, obtained, from, other, fossil, fuels, such, as, coal, or, natural, gas, or, renewable, sources, such, as, maize, palm, fruit, or, sugar, cane, the, two, most, common, petrochemical, classes, are, olefins, including, ethylene, and, propylene, and, aromatics, including, benzene, toluene, and, xylene, isomers, oil, refineries, produce, olefins, and, aromatics, by, fluid, catalytic, cracking, of, petroleum, fractions, chemical, plants, produce, olefins, by, steam, cracking, of, natural, gas, liquids, like, ethane, and, propane, aromatics, are, produced, by, catalytic, reforming, of, naphtha, olefins, and, aromatics, are, the, building, blocks, for, a, wide, range, of, materials, such, as, solvents, detergents, and, adhesives, olefins, are, the, basis, for, polymers, and, oligomers, used, in, plastics, resins, fibers, elastomers, lubricants, and, gels, global, ethylene, production, was, 190, million, tonnes, and, propylene, was, 120, million, tonnes, in, 2019, aromatics, production, is, approximately, 70, million, tonnes, the, largest, petrochemical, industries, are, located, in, the, united, states, and, western, europe, however, major, growth, in, new, production, capacity, is, in, the, middle, east, and, asia, there, is, substantial, inter, regional, petrochemical, trade, primary, petrochemicals, are, divided, into, three, groups, depending, on, their, chemical, structure, in, 2007, the, amounts, of, ethylene, and, propylene, produced, in, steam, crackers, were, about, 115, m, t, megatonnes, and, 70, mt, respectively, the, output, ethylene, capacity, of, large, steam, crackers, ranged, up, to, as, much, as, 1, 0, 1, 5, mt, per, year, the, adjacent, diagram, schematically, depicts, the, major, hydrocarbon, sources, and, processes, used, in, producing, petrochemicals, like, commodity, chemicals, petrochemicals, are, made, on, a, very, large, scale, petrochemical, manufacturing, units, differ, from, commodity, chemical, plants, in, that, they, often, produce, a, number, of, related, products, compare, this, with, specialty, chemical, and, fine, chemical, manufacture, where, products, are, made, in, discrete, batch, processes, petrochemicals, are, predominantly, made, in, a, few, manufacturing, locations, around, the, world, for, example, in, jubail, and, yanbu, industrial, cities, in, saudi, arabia, texas, and, louisiana, in, the, us, in, teesside, in, the, northeast, of, england, in, the, united, kingdom, in, tarragona, in, catalonia, in, rotterdam, in, the, netherlands, in, antwerp, in, belgium, in, jamnagar, dahej, in, gujarat, india, and, in, singapore, not, all, of, the, petrochemical, or, commodity, chemical, materials, produced, by, the, chemical, industry, are, made, in, one, single, location, but, groups, of, related, materials, are, often, made, in, adjacent, manufacturing, plants, to, induce, industrial, symbiosis, as, well, as, material, and, utility, efficiency, and, other, economies, of, scale, this, is, known, in, chemical, engineering, terminology, as, integrated, manufacturing, specialty, and, fine, chemical, companies, are, sometimes, found, in, similar, manufacturing, locations, as, petrochemicals, but, in, most, cases, they, do, not, need, the, same, level, of, large, scale, infrastructure, e, g, pipelines, storage, ports, and, power, etc, and, therefore, can, be, found, in, multi, sector, business, parks, the, large, scale, petrochemical, manufacturing, locations, have, clusters, of, manufacturing, units, that, share, utilities, and, large, scale, infrastructures, such, as, power, stations, storage, tanks, port, facilities, road, and, rail, terminals, in, the, united, kingdom, for, example, there, are, four, main, locations, for, such, manufacturing, near, the, river, mersey, in, north, west, england, on, the, humber, on, the, east, coast, of, yorkshire, in, grangemouth, near, the, firth, of, forth, in, scotland, and, in, teesside, as, part, of, the, northeast, of, england, process, industry, cluster, nepic, to, demonstrate, the, clustering, and, integration, some, 50, of, the, united, kingdom, s, petrochemical, and, commodity, chemicals, are, produced, by, the, nepic, industry, cluster, companies, in, teesside, in, 1835, henri, victor, regnault, a, french, chemist, left, vinyl, chloride, in, the, sun, and, found, white, solid, at, the, bottom, of, the, flask, which, was, polyvinyl, chloride, in, 1839, eduard, simon, discovered, polystyrene, by, accident, by, distilling, storax, in, 1856, william, henry, perkin, discovered, the, first, synthetic, dye, mauveine, in, 1888, friedrich, reinitzer, an, austrian, plant, scientist, observed, cholesteryl, benzoate, had, two, different, melting, points, in, 1909, leo, hendrik, baekeland, invented, bakelite, made, from, phenol, and, formaldehyde, in, 1928, synthetic, fuels, were, invented, using, fischer, tropsch, process, in, 1929, walter, bock, invented, synthetic, rubber, buna, s, which, is, made, up, of, styrene, and, butadiene, and, used, to, make, car, tires, in, 1933, otto, r, hm, polymerized, the, first, acrylic, glass, methyl, methacrylate, in, 1935, michael,

polyester, polyethylene, terephthalate, pet, bottles, are, made, from, ethylene, and, paraxylene, in, 1949, fritz, stastny, turned, polystyrene, into, foam, after, world, war, ii, polypropylene, was,
