a, printed, circuit, board, pcb, also, called, printed, wiring, board, pwb, is, a, medium, used, to, connect, or, wire, components, to, one, another, in, a, circuit, it, takes, the, form, of, a, laminated, sandwich, structure, of, conductive, and, insulating, layers, each, of, the, conductive, layers, is, designed, with, a, pattern, of, traces, planes, and, other, features, similar, to, wires, on, a, flat, surface, etched, from, one, or, more, sheet, layers, of, copper, laminated, onto, or, between, sheet, layers, of, a, non, conductive, substrate, electrical, components, may, be, fixed, to, conductive, pads, on, the, outer, layers, generally, by, means, of, soldering, which, both, electrically, connects, and, mechanically, fastens, the, components, to, the, board, another, manufacturing, process, adds, vias, drilled, holes, that, allow, electrical, interconnections, between, conductive, layers, printed, circuit, boards, are, used, in, nearly, all, electronic, products, alternatives, to, pcbs, include, wire, wrap, and, point, to, point, construction, both, once, popular, but, now, rarely, used, pcbs, require, additional, design, effort, to, lay, out, the, circuit, but, manufacturing, and, assembly, can, be, automated, electronic, design, automation, software, is, available, to, do, much, of, the, work, of, layout, mass, producing, circuits, with, pcbs, is, cheaper, and, faster, than, with, other, wiring, methods, as, components, are, mounted, and, wired, in, one, operation, large, numbers, of, pcbs, can, be, fabricated, at, the, same, time, and, the, layout, has, to, be, done, only, once, pcbs, can, also, be, made, manually, in, small, quantities, with, reduced, benefits, pcbs, can, be, single, sided, one, copper, layer, double, sided, two, copper, layers, on, both, sides, of, one, substrate, layer, or, multi, layer, outer, and, inner, layers, of, copper, alternating, with, layers, of, substrate, multi, layer, pcbs, allow, for, much, higher, component, density, because, circuit, traces, on, the, inner, layers, would, otherwise, take, up, surface, space, between, components, the, rise, in, popularity, of, multilayer, pcbs, with, more, than, two, and, especially, with, more, than, four, copper, planes, was, concurrent, with, the, adoption, of, surface, mount, technology, however, multilayer, pcbs, make, repair, analysis, and, field, modification, of, circuits, much, more, difficult, and, usually, impractical, the, world, market, for, bare, pcbs, exceeded, 60, 2, billion, in, 2014, and, is, estimated, to, reach, 79, billion, by, 2024, before, the, development, of, printed, circuit, boards, electrical, and, electronic, circuits, were, wired, point, to, point, on, a, chassis, typically, the, chassis, was, a, sheet, metal, frame, or, pan, sometimes, with, a, wooden, bottom, components, were, attached, to, the, chassis, usually, by, insulators, when, the, connecting, point, on, the, chassis, was, metal, and, then, their, leads, were, connected, directly, or, with, jumper, wires, by, soldering, or, sometimes, using, crimp, connectors, wire, connector, lugs, on, screw, terminals, or, other, methods, circuits, were, large, bulky, heavy, and, relatively, fragile, even, discounting, the, breakable, glass, envelopes, of, the, vacuum, tubes, that, were, often, included, in, the, circuits, and, production, was, labor, intensive, so, the, products, were, expensive, development, of, the, methods, used, in, modern, printed, circuit, boards, started, early, in, the, 20th, century, in, 1903, a, german, inventor, albert, hanson, described, flat, foil, conductors, laminated, to, an, insulating, board, in, multiple, layers, thomas, edison, experimented, with, chemical, methods, of, plating, conductors, onto, linen, paper, in, 1904, arthur, berry, in, 1913, patented, a, print, and, etch, method, in, the, uk, and, in, the, united, states, max, schoop, obtained, a, patent, to, flame, spray, metal, onto, a, board, through, a, patterned, mask, charles, ducas, in, 1925, patented, a, method, of, electroplating, circuit, patterns, predating, the, printed, circuit, invention, and, similar, in, spirit, was, john, sargrove, s, 1936, 1947, electronic, circuit, making, equipment, ecme, that, sprayed, metal, onto, a, bakelite, plastic, board, the, ecme, could, produce, three, radio, boards, per, minute, the, austrian, engineer, paul, eisler, invented, the, printed, circuit, as, part, of, a, radio, set, while, working, in, the, uk, around, 1936, in, 1941, a, multi, layer, printed, circuit, was, used, in, german, magnetic, influence, naval, mines, around, 1943, the, usa, began, to, use, the, technology, on, a, large, scale, to, make, proximity, fuzes, for, use, in, world, war, ii, such, fuzes, required, an, electronic, circuit, that, could, withstand, being, fired, from, a, gun, and, could, be, produced, in, quantity, the, centralab, division, of, globe, union, submitted, a, proposal, which, met, the, requirements, a, ceramic, plate, would, be, screenprinted, with, metallic, paint, for, conductors, and, carbon, material, for, resistors, with, ceramic, disc, capacitors, and, subminiature, vacuum, tubes, soldered, in, place, the, technique, proved, viable, and, the, resulting, patent, on, the, process, which, was, classified, by, the, u, s, army, was, assigned, to, globe, union, it, was, not, until, 1984, that, the, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, awarded, harry, w, rubinstein, the, cledo, brunetti, award, for, early, key, contributions, to, the, development, of, printed, components, and, conductors, on, a, common, insulating, substrate, rubinstein, was, honored, in, 1984, by, his, alma, mater, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, for, his, innovations, in, the, technology, of, printed, electronic, circuits, and, the, fabrication, of, capacitors, this, invention, also, represents, a, step, in, the, development, of, integrated, circuit, technology, as, not, only, wiring, but, also, passive, components, were, fabricated, on, the, ceramic, substrate, in, 1948, the, usa, released, the, invention, for, commercial, use, printed, circuits, did, not, become, commonplace, in, consumer, electronics, until, the, mid, 1950s, after, the, auto, sembly, process, was, developed, by, the, united, states, army, at, around, the, same, time, in, the, uk, work, along, similar, lines, was, carried, out, by, geoffrey, dummer, then, at, the, rrde, motorola, was, an, early, leader, in, bringing, the, process, into, consumer, electronics, announcing, in, august, 1952, the, adoption, of, plated, circuits, in, home, radios, after, six, years, of, research, and, a, 1m, investment, motorola, soon, began, using, its, trademarked, term, for, the, process, placir, in, its, consumer, radio, advertisements, hallicrafters, released, its, first, foto, etch, printed, circuit, product, a, clock, radio, on, 1, november, 1952, even, as, circuit, boards, became, available, the, point, to, point, chassis, construction, method, remained, in, common, use, in, industry, such, as, tv, and, hi, fi, sets, into, at, least, the, late, 1960s, printed, circuit, boards, were, introduced, to, reduce, the, size, weight, and, cost, of, parts, of, the, circuitry, in, 1960, a, small, consumer, radio, receiver, might, be, built, with, all, its, circuitry, on, one, circuit, board, but, a, tv, set, would, probably, contain, one, or, more, circuit, boards, originally, every, electronic, component, had, wire, leads, and, a, pcb, had, holes, drilled, for, each, wire, of, each, component, the, component, leads, were, then, inserted, through, the, holes, and, soldered, to, the, copper, pcb, traces, this, method, of, assembly, is, called, through, hole, construction, in, 1949, moe, abramson, and, stanislaus, f, danko, of, the, united, states, army, signal, corps, developed, the, auto, sembly, process, in, which, component, leads, were, inserted, into, a, copper, foil, interconnection, pattern, and, dip, soldered, the, patent, they, obtained, in, 1956, was, assigned, to, the, u, s, army, with, the, development, of, board, lamination, and, etching, techniques, this, concept, evolved, into, the, standard, printed, circuit, board, fabrication, process, in, use, today, soldering, could, be, done, automatically, by, passing, the, board, over, a, ripple, or, wave, of, molten, solder, in, a, wave, soldering, machine, however, the, wires, and, holes, are, inefficient, since, drilling, holes, is, expensive, and, consumes, drill, bits, and, the, protruding, wires, are, cut, off, and, discarded, from, the, 1980s, onward, small, surface, mount, parts, have, been, used, increasingly, instead, of, through, hole, components, this, has, led, to, smaller, boards, for, a, given, functionality, and, lower, production, costs, but, with, some, additional, difficulty, in, servicing, faulty, boards, in, the, 1990s, the, use, of, multilayer, surface, boards, became, more, frequent, as, a, result, size, was, further, minimized, and, both, flexible, and, rigid, pcbs, were, incorporated, in, different, devices, in, 1995, pcb, manufacturers, began, using, microvia, technology, to, produce, high, density, interconnect, hdi, pcbs, recent, advances, in, 3d, printing, have, meant, that, there, are, several, new, techniques, in, pcb, creation, 3d, printed, electronics, pes, can, be, utilized, to, print, items, layer, by, layer, and, subsequently, the, item, can, be, printed, with, a, liquid, ink, that, contains, electronic, functionalities, hdi, high, density, interconnect, technology, allows, for, a, denser, design, on, the, pcb, and, thus, potentially, smaller, pcbs, with, more, traces, and, components, in, a, given, area, as, a, result, the, paths, between, components, can, be, shorter, hdis, use, blind, buried, vias, or, a, combination, that, includes, microvias, with, multi, layer, hdi, pcbs, the, interconnection, of, several, vias, stacked, on, top, of, each, other, stacked, v, as, instead, of, one, deep, buried, via, can, be, made, stronger, thus, enhancing, reliability, in, all, conditions, the, most, common, applications, for, hdi, technology, are, computer, and, mobile, phone, components, as, well, as, medical, equipment, and, military, communication, equipment, a, 4, layer, hdi, microvia, pcb, is, equivalent, in, quality, to, an, 8, layer, through, hole, pcb, so, hdi, technology, can, reduce, costs, hdi, pcbs, are, often, made, using, build, up, film, such, as, ajinomoto, build, up, film, which, is, also, used, in, the, production, of, flip, chip, packages, some, pcbs, have, optical, waveguides, similar, to, optical, fibers, built, on, the, pcb, a, basic, pcb, consists, of, a, flat, sheet, of, insulating, material, and, a, layer, of, copper, foil, laminated, to, the, substrate, chemical, etching, divides, the, copper, into, separate, conducting, lines, called, tracks, or, circuit, traces, pads, for, connections, vias, to, pass, connections, between, layers, of, copper, and, features, such, as, solid, conductive, areas, for, electromagnetic, shielding, or, other, purposes, the, tracks, function, as, wires, fixed, in, place, and, are, insulated, from, each, other, by, air, and, the, board, substrate, material, the, surface, of, a, pcb, may, have, a, coating, that, protects, the, copper, from, corrosion, and, reduces, the, chances, of, solder, shorts, between, traces, or, undesired, electrical, contact, with, stray, bare, wires, for, its, function, in, helping, to, prevent, solder, shorts, the, coating, is, called, solder, resist, or, solder, mask, the, pattern, to, be, etched, into, each, copper, layer, of, a, pcb, is, called, the, artwork, the, etching, is, usually, done, using, photoresist, which, is, coated, onto, the, pcb, then, exposed, to, light, projected, in, the, pattern, of, the, artwork, the, resist, material, protects, the, copper, from, dissolution, into, the, etching, solution, the, etched, board, is, then, cleaned, a, pcb, design, can, be, mass, reproduced, in, a, way, similar, to, the, way, photographs, can, be, mass, duplicated, from, film, negatives, using, a, photographic, printer, fr, 4, glass, epoxy, is, the, most, common, insulating, substrate, another, substrate, material, is, cotton, paper, impregnated, with, phenolic, resin, often, tan, or, brown, when, a, pcb, has, no, components, installed, it, is, less, ambiguously, called, a, printed, wiring, board, pwb, or, etched, wiring, board, however, the, term, printed, wiring, board, has, fallen, into, disuse, a, pcb, populated, with, electronic, components, is, called, a, printed, circuit, assembly, pca, printed, circuit, board, assembly, or, pcb, assembly, pcba, in, informal, usage, the, term, printed, circuit, board, most, commonly, means, printed, circuit, assembly, with, components, the, ipc, preferred, term, for, an, assembled, board, is, circuit, card, assembly, cca, and, for, an, assembled, backplane, it, is, backplane, assembly, card, is, another, widely, used, informal, term, for, a, printed, circuit, assembly, for, example, expansion, card, a, pcb, may, be, printed, with, a, legend, identifying, the, components, test, points, or, identifying, text, originally, silkscreen, printing, was, used, for, this, purpose, but, today, other, finer, quality, printing, methods, are, usually, used, normally, the, legend, does, not, affect, the, function, of, a, pcba, a, printed, circuit, board, can, have, multiple, layers, of, copper, which, almost, always, are, arranged, in, pairs, the, number, of, layers, and, the, interconnection, designed, between, them, vias, pths, provide, a, general, estimate, of, the, board, complexity, using, more, layers, allow, for, more, routing, options, and, better, control, of, signal, integrity, but, are, also, time, consuming, and, costly, to, manufacture, likewise, selection, of, the, vias, for, the, board, also, allow, fine, tuning, of, the, board, size, escaping, of, signals, off, complex, ics, routing, and, long, term, reliability, but, are, tightly, coupled, with, production, complexity, and, cost, one, of, the, simplest, boards, to, produce, is, the, two, layer, board, it, has, copper, on, both, sides, that, are, referred, to, as, external, layers, multi, layer, boards, sandwich, additional, internal, layers, of, copper, and, insulation, after, two, layer, pcbs, the, next, step, up, is, the, four, layer, the, four, layer, board, adds, significantly, more, routing, options, in, the, internal, layers, as, compared, to, the, two, layer, board, and, often, some, portion, of, the, internal, layers, is, used, as, ground, plane, or, power, plane, to, achieve, better, signal, integrity, higher, signaling, frequencies, lower, emi, and, better, power, supply, decoupling, in, multi, layer, boards, the, layers, of, material, are, laminated, together, in, an, alternating, sandwich, copper, substrate, copper, substrate, copper, etc, each, plane, of, copper, is, etched, and, any, internal, vias, that, will, not, extend, to, both, outer, surfaces, of, the, finished, multilayer, board, are, plated, through, before, the, layers, are, laminated, together, only, the, outer, layers, need, be, coated, the, inner, copper, layers, are, protected, by, the, adjacent, substrate, layers, through, hole, components, are, mounted, by, their, wire, leads, passing, through, the, board, and, soldered, to, traces, on, the, other, side, surface, mount, components, are, attached, by, their, leads, to, copper, traces, on, the, same, side, of, the, board, a, board, may, use, both, methods, for, mounting, components, pcbs, with, only, through, hole, mounted, components, are, now, uncommon, surface, mounting, is, used, for, transistors, diodes, ic, chips, resistors, and, capacitors, through, hole, mounting, may, be, used, for, some, large, components, such, as, electrolytic, capacitors, and, connectors, the, first, pcbs, used, through, hole, technology, mounting, electronic, components, by, leads, inserted, through, holes, on, one, side, of, the, board, and, soldered, onto, copper, traces, on, the, other, side, boards, may, be, single, sided, with, an, unplated, component, side, or, more, compact, double, sided, boards, with, components, soldered, on, both, sides, horizontal, installation, of, through, hole, parts, with, two, axial, leads, such, as, resistors, capacitors, and, diodes, is, done, by, bending, the, leads, 90, degrees, in, the, same, direction, inserting, the, part, in, the, board, often, bending, leads, located, on, the, back, of, the, board, in, opposite, directions, to, improve, the, part, s, mechanical, strength, soldering, the, leads, and, trimming, off, the, ends, leads, may, be, soldered, either, manually, or, by, a, wave, soldering, machine, through, hole, manufacture, adds, to, board, cost, by, requiring, many, holes, to, be, drilled, accurately, and, it, limits, the, available, routing, area, for, signal, traces, on, layers, immediately, below, the, top, layer, on, multi, layer, boards, since, the, holes, must, pass, through, all, layers, to, the, opposite, side, once, surface, mounting, came, into, use, small, sized, smd, components, were, used, where, possible, with, through, hole, mounting, only, of, components, unsuitably, large, for, surface, mounting, due, to, power, requirements, or, mechanical, limitations, or, subject, to, mechanical, stress, which, might, damage, the, pcb, e, g, by, lifting, the, copper, off, the, board, surface, surface, mount, technology, emerged, in, the, 1960s, gained, momentum, in, the, early, 1980s, and, became, widely, used, by, the, mid, 1990s, components, were, mechanically, redesigned, to, have, small, metal, tabs, or, end, caps, that, could, be, soldered, directly, onto, the, pcb, surface, instead, of, wire, leads, to, pass, through, holes, components, became, much, smaller, and, component, placement, on, both, sides, of, the, board, became, more, common, than, with, through, hole, mounting, allowing, much, smaller, pcb, assemblies, with, much, higher, circuit, densities, surface, mounting, lends, itself, well, to, a, high, degree, of, automation, reducing, labor, costs, and, greatly, increasing, production, rates, compared, with, through, hole, circuit, boards, components, can, be, supplied, mounted, on, carrier, tapes, surface, mount, components, can, be, about, one, quarter, to, one, tenth, of, the, size, and, weight, of, through, hole, components, and, passive, components, much, cheaper, however, prices, of, semiconductor, surface, mount, devices, smds, are, determined, more, by, the, chip, itself, than, the, package, with, little, price, advantage, over, larger, packages, and, some, wire, ended, components, such, as, 1n4148, small, signal, switch, diodes, are, actually, significantly, cheaper, than, smd, equivalents, each, trace, consists, of, a, flat, narrow, part, of, the, copper, foil, that, remains, after, etching, its, resistance, determined, by, its, width, thickness, and, length, must, be, sufficiently, low, for, the, current, the, conductor, will, carry, power, and, ground, traces, may, need, to, be, wider, than, signal, traces, in, a, multi, layer, board, one, entire, layer, may, be, mostly, solid, copper, to, act, as, a, ground, plane, for, shielding, and, power, return, for, microwave, circuits, transmission, lines, can, be, laid, out, in, a, planar, form, such, as, stripline, or, microstrip, with, carefully, controlled, dimensions, to, assure, a, consistent, impedance, in, radio, frequency, and, fast, switching, circuits, the, inductance, and, capacitance, of, the, printed, circuit, board, conductors, become, significant, circuit, elements, usually, undesired, conversely, they, can, be, used, as, a, deliberate, part, of, the, circuit, design, as, in, distributed, element, filters, antennae, and, fuses, obviating, the, need, for, additional, discrete, components, high, density, interconnects, hdi, pcbs, have, tracks, or, vias, with, a, width, or, diameter, of, under, 152, micrometers, laminates, are, manufactured, by, curing, layers, of, cloth, or, paper, with, thermoset, resin, under, pressure, and, heat, to, form, an, integral, final, piece, of, uniform, thickness, they, can, be, up, to, 4, by, 8, feet, 1, 2, by, 2, 4, m, in, width, and, length, varying, cloth, weaves, threads, per, inch, or, cm, cloth, thickness, and, resin, percentage, are, used, to, achieve, the, desired, final, thickness, and, dielectric, characteristics, available, standard, laminate, thickness, are, listed, in, ansi, ipc, d, 275, the, cloth, or, fiber, material, used, resin, material, and, the, cloth, to, resin, ratio, determine, the, laminate, s, type, designation, fr, 4, cem, 1, g, 10, etc, and, therefore, the, characteristics, of, the, laminate, produced, important, characteristics, are, the, level, to, which, the, laminate, is, fire, retardant, the, dielectric, constant, e, r, the, loss, tangent, tan, the, tensile, strength, the, shear, strength, the, glass, transition, temperature, t, g, and, the, z, axis, expansion, coefficient, how, much, the, thickness, changes, with, temperature, there, are, quite, a, few, different, dielectrics, that, can, be, chosen, to, provide, different, insulating, values, depending, on, the, requirements, of, the, circuit, some, of, these, dielectrics, are, polytetrafluoroethylene, teflon, fr, 4, fr, 1, cem, 1, or, cem, 3, well, known, pre, preg, materials, used, in, the, pcb, industry, are, fr, 2, phenolic, cotton, paper, fr, 3, cotton, paper, and, epoxy, fr, 4, woven, glass, and, epoxy, fr, 5, woven, glass, and, epoxy, fr, 6, matte, glass, and, polyester, g, 10, woven, glass, and, epoxy, cem, 1, cotton, paper, and, epoxy,

especially, with, ball, grid, array, bga, and, naked, die, technologies, and, glass, fiber, offers, the, best, dimensional, stability, fr, 4, is, by, far, the, most, common, material, used, today, the, board, stock, with, unetched, copper, on, it, is, called, copper, clad, laminate, with, decreasing, size, of, board, features, and, increasing, frequencies, small, nonhomogeneities, like, uneven, distribution, of, fiberglass, or, other, filler, thickness, variations, and, bubbles, in, the, resin, matrix, and, the, associated, local, variations, in, the, dielectric, constant, are, gaining, importance, the, circuitboard, substrates, are, usually, dielectric, composite, materials, the, composites, contain, a, matrix, usually, an, epoxy, resin, and, a, reinforcement, usually, a, woven, sometimes, nonwoven, glass, fibers, sometimes, even, paper, and, in, some, cases, a, filler, is, added, to, the, resin, e, g, ceramics, titanate, ceramics, can, be, used, to, increase, the, dielectric, constant, the, reinforcement, type, defines, two, major, classes, of, materials, woven, and, non, woven, woven, reinforcements, are, cheaper, but, the, high, dielectric, constant, of, glass, may, not, be, favorable, for, many, higher, frequency, applications, the, spatially, nonhomogeneous, structure, also, introduces, local, variations, in, electrical, parameters, due, to, different, resin, glass, ratio, at, different, areas, of, the, weave, pattern, nonwoven, reinforcements, or, materials, with, low, or, no, reinforcement, are, more, expensive, but, more, suitable, for, some, rf, analog, applications, the, substrates, are, characterized, by, several, key, parameters, chiefly, thermomechanical, glass, transition, temperature, tensile, strength, shear, strength, thermal, expansion, electrical, dielectric, constant, loss, tangent, dielectric, breakdown, voltage, leakage, current, tracking, resistance, and, others, e, g, moisture, absorption, at, the, glass,

confine, the, board, along, the, plane, virtually, all, volume, expansion, projects, to, the, thickness, and, stresses, the, plated, through, holes, repeated, soldering, or, other, exposition, to, higher, temperatures, can, cause, failure, of, the, plating, especially, with, thicker, boards, thick, boards, therefore, require, a, matrix, with, a, high, t, g, the, materials, used, determine, the, substrate, s, dielectric, constant, this, constant, is, also, dependent, on, frequency, usually, decreasing, with, frequency, as, this, constant, determines, the, signal, propagation, speed, frequency, dependence, introduces, phase, distortion, in, wideband, applications, as, flat, a, dielectric, constant, vs, frequency, characteristics, as, is, achievable, is, important, here, the, impedance, of, transmission, lines, decreases, with, frequency, therefore, faster, edges, of, signals, reflect, more, than, slower, ones, dielectric, breakdown, voltage, determines, the, maximum, voltage, gradient, the, material, can, be, subjected, to, before, suffering, a, breakdown, conduction, or, arcing, through, the, dielectric, tracking, resistance, determines, how, the, material, resists, high, voltage, electrical, discharges, creeping, over, the, board, surface, loss, tangent, determines, how, much, of, the, electromagnetic, energy, from, the, signals, in, the, conductors, is, absorbed, in, the, board, material, this, factor, is, important, for, high, frequencies, low, loss, materials, are, more, expensive, choosing, unnecessarily, low, loss, material, is, a, common, engineering, error, in, high, frequency, digital, design, it, increases, the, cost, of, the, boards, without, a, corresponding, benefit, signal, degradation, by, loss, tangent, and, dielectric, constant, can, be, easily, assessed, by, an, eye, pattern, moisture, absorption, occurs, when, the, material, is, exposed, to, high, humidity, or, water, both, the, resin, and, the, reinforcement, may, absorb, water, water, also, may, be, soaked, by, capillary, forces, through, voids, in, the, materials, and, along, the, reinforcement, epoxies, of, the, fr, 4, materials, are, not, too, susceptible, with, absorption, of, only, 0, 15, teflon, has, very, low, absorption, of, 0, 01, polyimides, and, cyanate, esters, on, the, other, side, suffer, from, high, water, absorption, absorbed,

for, through, holes, will, increase, the, finished, copper, weight, some, pcb, manufacturers, refer, to, 1, oz, ft, 2, copper, foil, as, having, a, thickness, of, 35, m, may, also, be, referred, to, as, 35, 35, micron, or, 35, mic, manufacturing, starts, from, the, fabrication, data, generated, by, computer, aided, design, and, component, information, the, fabrication, data, is, read, into, the, cam, computer, aided, manufacturing, software, cam, performs, the, following, functions, initially, pcbs, were, designed, manually, by, creating, a, photomask, on, a, clear, mylar, sheet, usually, at, two, or, four, times, the, true, size, starting, from, the, schematic, diagram, the, component, pin, pads, were, laid, out, on, the, mylar, and, then, traces, were, routed, to, connect, the, pads, rub, on, dry, transfers, of, common, component, footprints, increased, efficiency, traces, were, made, with, self, adhesive, tape, pre, printed, non, reproducing, grids, on, the, mylar, assisted, in, layout, the, finished, photomask, was, photolithographically, reproduced, onto, a, photoresist, coating, on, the, blank, copper, clad, boards, modern, pcbs, are, designed, with, dedicated, layout, software, generally, in, the, following, steps, several, small, printed, circuit, boards, can, be, grouped, together, for, processing, as, a, panel, a, panel, consisting, of, a, design, duplicated, n, times, is, also, called, an, n, panel, whereas, a, multi, panel, combines, several, different, designs, onto, a, single, panel, the, outer, tooling, strip, often, includes, tooling, holes, a, set, of, panel, fiducials, a, test, coupon, and, may, include, hatched, copper, pour, or, similar, patterns, for, even, copper, distribution, over, the, whole, panel, in, order, to, avoid, bending, the, assemblers, often, mount, components, on, panels, rather, than, single, pcbs, because, this, is, efficient, panelization, may, also, be, necessary, for, boards, with, components, placed, near, an, edge, of, the, board, because, otherwise, the, board, could, not, be, mounted, during, assembly, most, assembly, shops, require, a, free, area, of, at, least, 10, mm, around, the, board, the, panel, is, eventually, broken, into, individual, pcbs, along, perforations, or, grooves, in, the, panel, through, milling, or, cutting, for, milled, panels, a, common, distance, between, the, individual, boards, is, 2, 3, mm, today, depaneling, is, often, done, by, lasers, which, cut, the, board, with, no, contact, laser, depaneling, reduces, stress, on, the, fragile, circuits, improving, the, yield, of, defect, free, units, the, first, step, is, to, replicate, the, pattern, in, the, fabricator, s, cam, system, on, a, protective, mask, on, the, copper, foil, pcb, layers, subsequent, etching, removes, the, unwanted, copper, unprotected, by, the, mask, alternatively, a, conductive, ink, can, be, ink, jetted, on, a, blank, non, conductive, board, this, technique, is, also, used, in, the, manufacture, of, hybrid, circuits, the, method, chosen, depends, on, the, number, of, boards, to, be, produced, and, the, required, resolution, the, process, by, which, copper, traces, are, applied, to, the, surface, is, known, as, etching, after, the, subtractive, method, of, the, process, though, there, are, also, additive, and, semi, additive, methods, subtractive, methods, remove, copper, from, an, entirely, copper, coated, board, to, leave, only, the, desired, copper, pattern, the, simplest, method, used, for, small, scale, production, and, often, by, hobbyists, is, immersion, etching, in, which, the, board, is, submerged, in, etching, solution, such, as, ferric, chloride, compared, with, methods, used, for, mass, production, the, etching, time, is, long, heat, and, agitation, can, be, applied, to, the, bath, to, speed, the, etching, rate, in, bubble, etching, air, is, passed, through, the, etchant, bath, to, agitate, the, solution, and, speed, up, etching, splash, etching, uses, a, motor, driven, paddle, to, splash, boards, with, etchant, the, process, has, become, commercially, obsolete, since, it, is, not, as, fast, as, spray, etching, in, spray, etching, the, etchant, solution, is, distributed, over, the, boards, by, nozzles, and, recirculated, by, pumps, adjustment, of, the, nozzle, pattern, flow, rate, temperature, and, etchant, composition, gives, predictable, control, of, etching, rates, and, high, production, rates, as, more, copper, is, consumed, from, the, boards, the, etchant, becomes, saturated, and, less, effective, different, etchants, have, different, capacities, for, copper, with, some, as, high, as, 150, grams, of, copper, per, liter, of, solution, in, commercial, use, etchants, can, be, regenerated, to, restore, their, activity, and, the, dissolved, copper, recovered, and, sold, small, scale, etching, requires, attention, to, disposal, of, used, etchant, which, is, corrosive, and, toxic, due, to, its, metal, content, the, etchant, removes, copper, on, all, surfaces, not, protected, by, the, resist, undercut, occurs, when, etchant, attacks, the, thin, edge, of, copper, under, the, resist, this, can, reduce, conductor, widths, and, cause, open, circuits, careful, control, of, etch, time, is, required, to, prevent, undercut, where, metallic, plating, is, used, as, a, resist, it, can, overhang, which, can, cause, short, circuits, between, adjacent, traces, when, closely, spaced, overhang, can, be, removed, by, wire, brushing, the, board, after, etching, in, additive, methods, the, pattern, is, electroplated, onto, a, bare, substrate, using, a, complex, process, the, advantage, of, the, additive, method, is, that, less, material, is, needed, and, less, waste, is, produced, in, the, full, additive, process, the, bare, laminate, is, covered, with, a, photosensitive, film, which, is, imaged, exposed, to, light, through, a, mask, and, then, developed, which, removes, the, unexposed, film, the, exposed, areas, are, sensitized, in, a, chemical, bath, usually, containing, palladium, and, similar, to, that, used, for, through, hole, plating, which, makes, the, exposed, area, capable, of, bonding, metal, ions, the, laminate, is, then, plated, with, copper, in, the, sensitized, areas, when, the, mask, is, stripped, the, pcb, is, finished, semi, additive, is, the, most, common, process, the, unpatterned, board, has, a, thin, layer, of, copper, already, on, it, a, reverse, mask, is, then, applied, unlike, a, subtractive, process, mask, this, mask, exposes, those, parts, of, the, substrate, that, will, eventually, become, the, traces, additional, copper, is, then, plated, onto, the, board, in, the, unmasked, areas, copper, may, be, plated, to, any, desired, weight, tin, lead, or, other, surface, platings, are, then, applied, the, mask, is, stripped, away, and, a, brief, etching, step, removes, the, now, exposed, bare, original, copper, laminate, from, the, board, isolating, the, individual, traces, some, single, sided, boards, which, have, plated, through, holes, are, made, in, this, way, general, electric, made, consumer, radio, sets, in, the, late, 1960s, using, additive, boards, the, semi, additive, process, is, commonly, used, for, multi, layer, boards, as, it, facilitates, the, plating, through, of, the, holes, to, produce, conductive, vias, in, the, circuit, board, industrial, etching, is, usually, done, with, ammonium, persulfate, or, ferric, chloride, for, pth, plated, through, holes, additional, steps, of, electroless, deposition, are, done, after, the, holes, are, drilled, then, copper, is, electroplated, to, build, up, the, thickness, the, boards, are, screened, and, plated, with, tin, lead, the, tin, lead, becomes, the, resist, leaving, the, bare, copper, to, be, etched, away, multi, layer, printed, circuit, boards, have, trace, layers, inside, the, board, this, is, achieved, by, laminating, a, stack, of, materials, in, a, press, by, applying, pressure, and, heat, for, a, period, of, time, this, results, in, an, inseparable, one, piece, product, for, example, a, four, layer, pcb, can, be, fabricated, by, starting, from, a, two, sided, copper, clad, laminate, etch, the, circuitry, on, both, sides, then, laminate, to, the, top, and, bottom, pre, preg, and, copper, foil, it, is, then, drilled, plated, and, etched, again, to, get, traces, on, top, and, bottom, layers, the, inner, layers, are, given, a, complete, machine, inspection, before, lamination, because, mistakes, cannot, be, corrected, afterwards, automatic, optical, inspection, aoi, machines, compare, an, image, of, the, board, with, the, digital, image, generated, from, the, original, design, data, automated, optical, shaping, aos, machines, can, then, add, missing, copper, or, remove, excess, copper, using, a, laser, reducing, the, number, of, pcbs, that, have, to, be, discarded, pcb, tracks, can, have, a, width, of, just, 10, micrometers, holes, through, a, pcb, are, typically, drilled, with, drill, bits, coated, with, tungsten, carbide, coated, tungsten, carbide, is, used, because, board, materials, are, abrasive, high, speed, steel, bits, would, dull, quickly, tearing, the, copper, and, ruining, the, board, drilling, is, done, by, computer, controlled, drilling, machines, using, a, drill, file, or, excellon, file, that, describes, the, location, and, size, of, each, drilled, hole, holes, may, be, made, conductive, by, electroplating, or, inserting, hollow, metal, eyelets, to, connect, board, layers, some, conductive, holes, are, intended, for, the, insertion, of, through, hole, component, leads, others, used, to, connect, board, layers, are, called, vias, when, vias, with, a, diameter, smaller, than, 76, 2, micrometers, are, required, drilling, with, mechanical, bits, is, impossible, because, of, high, rates, of, wear, and, breakage, in, this, case, the, vias, may, be, laser, drilled, evaporated, by, lasers, laser, drilled, vias, typically, have, an, inferior, surface, finish, inside, the, hole, these, holes, are, called, micro, vias, and, can, have, diameters, as, small, as, 10, micrometers, it, is, also, possible, with, controlled, depth, drilling, laser, drilling, or, by, pre, drilling, the, individual, sheets, of, the, pcb, before, lamination, to, produce, holes, that, connect, only, some, of, the, copper, layers, rather, than, passing, through, the, entire, board, these, holes, are, called, blind, vias, when, they, connect, an, internal, copper, layer, to, an, outer, layer, or, buried, vias, when, they, connect, two, or, more, internal, copper, layers, and, no, outer, layers, laser, drilling, machines, can, drill, thousands, of, holes, per, second, and, can, use, either, uv, or, co, 2, lasers, the, hole, walls, for, boards, with, two, or, more, layers, can, be, made, conductive, and, then, electroplated, with, copper, to, form, plated, through, holes, these, holes, electrically, connect, the, conducting, layers, of, the, pcb, for, multi, layer, boards, those, with, three, layers, or, more, drilling, typically, produces, a, smear, of, the, high, temperature, decomposition, products, of, bonding, agent, in, the, laminate, system, before, the, holes, can, be, plated, through, this, smear, must, be, removed, by, a, chemical, de, smear, process, or, by, plasma, etching, the, de, smear, process, ensures, that, a, good, connection, is, made, to, the, copper, layers, when, the, hole, is, plated, through, on, high, reliability, boards, a, process, called, etch, back, is, performed, chemically, with, a, potassium, permanganate, based, etchant, or, plasma, etching, the, etch, back, removes, resin, and, the, glass, fibers, so, that, the, copper, layers, extend, into, the, hole, and, as, the, hole, is, plated, become, integral, with, the, deposited, copper, proper, plating, or, surface, finish, selection, can, be, critical, to, process, yield, the, amount, of, rework, field, failure, rate, and, reliability, pcbs, may, be, plated, with, solder, tin, or, gold, over, nickel, after, pcbs, are, etched, and, then, rinsed, with, water, the, solder, mask, is, applied, and, then, any, exposed, copper, is, coated, with, solder, nickel, gold, or, some, other, anti, corrosion, coating, it, is, important, to, use, solder, compatible, with, both, the, pcb, and, the, parts, used, an, example, is, ball, grid, array, bga, using, tin, lead, solder, balls, for, connections, losing, their, balls, on, bare, copper, traces, or, using, lead, free, solder, paste, other, platings, used, are, organic, solderability, preservative, osp, immersion, silver, iag, immersion, tin, isn, electroless, nickel, immersion, gold, enig, coating, electroless, nickel, electroless, palladium, immersion, gold, enepig, and, direct, gold, plating, over, nickel, edge, connectors, placed, along, one, edge, of, some, boards, are, often, nickel, plated, then, gold, plated, using, enig, another, coating, consideration, is, rapid, diffusion, of, coating, metal, into, tin, solder, tin, forms, intermetallics, such, as, cu, 6, sn, 5, and, ag, 3, cu, that, dissolve, into, the, tin, liquidus, or, solidus, at, 50, c, stripping, surface, coating, or, leaving, voids, electrochemical, migration, ecm, is, the, growth, of, conductive, metal, filaments, on, or, in, a, printed, circuit, board, pcb, under, the, influence, of, a, dc, voltage, bias, silver, zinc, and, aluminum, are, known, to, grow, whiskers, under, the, influence, of, an, electric, field, silver, also, grows, conducting, surface, paths, in, the, presence, of, halide, and, other, ions, making, it, a, poor, choice, for, electronics, use, tin, will, grow, whiskers, due, to, tension, in, the, plated, surface, tin, lead, or, solder, plating, also, grows, whiskers, only, reduced, by, reducing, the, percentage, of, tin, reflow, to, melt, solder, or, tin, plate, to, relieve, surface, stress, lowers, whisker, incidence, another, coating, issue, is, tin, pest, the, transformation, of, tin, to, a, powdery, allotrope, at, low, temperature, areas, that, should, not, be, soldered, may, be, covered, with, solder, resist, solder, mask, the, solder, mask, is, what, gives, pcbs, their, characteristic, green, color, although, it, is, also, available, in, several, other, colors, such, as, red, blue, purple, yellow, black, and, white, one, of, the, most, common, solder, resists, used, today, is, called, lpi, liquid, photoimageable, solder, mask, a, photo, sensitive, coating, is, applied, to, the, surface, of, the, pwb, then, exposed, to, light, through, the, solder, mask, image, film, and, finally, developed, where, the, unexposed, areas, are, washed, away, dry, film, solder, mask, is, similar, to, the, dry, film, used, to, image, the, pwb, for, plating, or, etching, after, being, laminated, to, the, pwb, surface, it, is, imaged, and, developed, as, lpi, once, but, no, longer, commonly, used, because, of, its, low, accuracy, and, resolution, is, to, screen, print, epoxy, ink, in, addition, to, repelling, solder, solder, resist, also, provides, protection, from, the, environment, to, the, copper, that, would, otherwise, be, exposed, a, legend, also, known, as, silk, or, silkscreen, is, often, printed, on, one, or, both, sides, of, the, pcb, it, contains, the, component, designators, switch, settings, test, points, and, other, indications, helpful, in, assembling, testing, servicing, and, sometimes, using, the, circuit, board, there, are, three, methods, to, print, the, legend, boards, with, no, components, installed, are, usually, bare, board, tested, for, shorts, and, opens, this, is, called, electrical, test, or, pcb, e, test, a, short, is, a, connection, between, two, points, that, should, not, be, connected, an, open, is, a, missing, connection, between, points, that, should, be, connected, for, high, volume, production, a, fixture, such, as, a, bed, of, nails, in, a, rigid, needle, adapter, makes, contact, with, copper, lands, on, the, board, the, fixture, or, adapter, is, a, significant, fixed, cost, and, this, method, is, only, economical, for, high, volume, or, high, value, production, for, small, or, medium, volume, production, flying, probe, testers, are, used, where, test, probes, are, moved, over, the, board, by, an, xy, drive, to, make, contact, with, the, copper, lands, there, is, no, need, for, a, fixture, and, hence, the, fixed, costs, are, much, lower, the, cam, system, instructs, the, electrical, tester, to, apply, a, voltage, to, each, contact, point, as, required, and, to, check, that, this, voltage, appears, on, the, appropriate, contact, points, and, only, on, these, in, assembly, the, bare, board, is, populated, or, stuffed, with, electronic, components, to, form, a, functional, printed, circuit, assembly, pca, sometimes, called, a, printed, circuit, board, assembly, pcba, in, through, hole, technology, the, component, leads, are, inserted, in, holes, surrounded, by, conductive, pads, the, holes, keep, the, components, in, place, in, surface, mount, technology, smt, the, component, is, placed, on, the, pcb, so, that, the, pins, line, up, with, the, conductive, pads, or, lands, on, the, surfaces, of, the, pcb, solder, paste, which, was, previously, applied, to, the, pads, holds, the, components, in, place, temporarily, if, surface, mount, components, are, applied, to, both, sides, of, the, board, the, bottom, side, components, are, glued, to, the, board, in, both, through, hole, and, surface, mount, the, components, are, then, soldered, once, cooled, and, solidified, the, solder, holds, the, components, in, place, permanently, and, electrically, connects, them, to, the, board, there, are, a, variety, of, soldering, techniques, used, to, attach, components, to, a, pcb, high, volume, production, is, usually, done, with, a, pick, and, place, machine, and, bulk, wave, soldering, for, through, hole, parts, or, reflow, ovens, for, smt, components, or, through, hole, parts, but, skilled, technicians, are, able, to, hand, solder, very, tiny, parts, for, instance, 0201, packages, which, are, 0, 02, in, by, 0, 01, in, under, a, microscope, using, tweezers, and, a, fine, tip, soldering, iron, for, small, volume, prototypes, selective, soldering, may, be, used, for, delicate, parts, some, smt, parts, cannot, be, soldered, by, hand, such, as, bga, packages, all, through, hole, components, can, be, hand, soldered, making, them, favored, for, prototyping, where, size, weight, and, the, use, of, the, exact, components, that, would, be, used, in, high, volume, production, are, not, concerns, often, through, hole, and, surface, mount, construction, must, be, combined, in, a, single, assembly, because, some, required, components, are, available, only, in, surface, mount, packages, while, others, are, available, only, in, through, hole, packages, or, even, if, all, components, are, available, in, through, hole, packages, it, might, be, desired, to, take, advantage, of, the, size, weight, and, cost, reductions, obtainable, by, using, some, available, surface, mount, devices, another, reason, to, use, both, methods, is, that, through, hole, mounting, can, provide, needed, strength, for, components, likely, to, endure, physical, stress, such, as, connectors, that, are, frequently, mated, and, demated, or, that, connect, to, cables, expected, to, impart, substantial, stress, to, the, pcb, and, connector, interface, while, components, that, are, expected, to, go, untouched, will, take, up, less, space, using, surface, mount, techniques, for, further, comparison, see, the, smt, page, after, the, board, has, been, populated, it, may, be, tested, in, a, variety, of, ways, to, facilitate, these, tests, pcbs, may, be, designed, with, extra, pads, to, make, temporary, connections, sometimes, these, pads, must, be, isolated, with, resistors, the, in, circuit, test, may, also, exercise, boundary, scan, test, features, of, some, components, in, circuit, test, systems, may, also, be, used, to, program, nonvolatile, memory, components, on, the, board, in, boundary, scan, testing, test, circuits, integrated, into, various, ics, on, the, board, form, temporary, connections, between, the, pcb, traces, to, test, that, the, ics, are, mounted, correctly, boundary, scan, testing, requires, that, all, the, ics, to, be, tested, use, a, standard, test, configuration, procedure, the, most, common, one, being, the, joint, test, action, group, jtag, standard, the, jtag, test, architecture, provides, a, means, to, test, interconnects, between, integrated, circuits, on, a, board, without, using, physical, test, probes, by, using, circuitry, in, the, ics, to, employ, the, ic, pins, themselves, as, test, probes, jtag, tool, vendors, provide, various, types, of, stimuli, and, sophisticated, algorithms, not, only, to, detect, the, failing, nets, but, also, to, isolate, the, faults, to, specific, nets, devices, and, pins, when, boards, fail, the, test, technicians, may, desolder, and, replace, failed, components, a, task, known, as, rework, pcbs, intended, for, extreme, environments, often, have, a, conformal, coating, which, is, applied, by, dipping, or, spraying, after, the, components, have, been, soldered, the, coat, prevents, corrosion, and, leakage, currents, or, shorting, due, to, condensation, the, earliest, conformal, coats, were, wax, modern, conformal, coats, are, usually, dips, of, dilute, solutions, of, silicone, rubber, polyurethane, acrylic, or, epoxy, another, technique, for, applying, a, conformal, coating, is, for, plastic, to, be, sputtered, onto, the, pcb, in, a, vacuum, chamber, the, chief, disadvantage, of, conformal, coatings, is, that, servicing, of, the, board, is, rendered, extremely, difficult, many, assembled, pcbs, are, static, sensitive, and, therefore, they, must, be, placed, in, antistatic, bags, during, transport, when, handling, these, boards, the, user, must, be, grounded, earthed, improper, handling, techniques, might, transmit, an, accumulated, static, charge, through, the, board, damaging, or, destroying, components, the, damage, might, not, immediately, affect, function, but, might, lead, to, early, failure, later, on, cause, intermittent, operating, faults, or, cause, a, narrowing, of, the, range, of, environmental, and, electrical, conditions, under, which, the, board, functions, properly, even, bare, boards, are, sometimes, static, sensitive, traces, have, become, so, fine, that, it, is, possible, to, blow, a, trace, or, change, its, characteristics, with, a, static, discharge, this, is, especially, true, on, non, traditional, pcbs, such, as, mcms, and, microwave, pcbs, cordwood, construction, can, save, significant, space, and, was, often, used, with, wire, ended, components, in, applications, where, space, was, at, a, premium, such, as, fuzes, missile, guidance, and, telemetry, systems, and, in, high, speed, computers, where, short, traces, were, important, in, cordwood, construction, axial, leaded, components, were, mounted, between, two, parallel, planes, the, name, comes, from, the, way, axial, lead, components, capacitors, resistors, coils, and, diodes, are, stacked, in, parallel, rows, and, columns, like, a, stack, of, firewood, the, components, were, either, soldered, together, with, jumper, wire, or, they, were, connected, to, other, components, by, thin, nickel, ribbon, welded, at, right, angles, onto, the, component, leads, to, avoid, shorting, together, different, interconnection, layers, thin, insulating, cards, were, placed, between, them, perforations, or, holes, in, the, cards, allowed, component, leads, to, project, through, to, the, next, interconnection, layer, one, disadvantage, of, this, system, was, that, special, nickel, leaded, components, had, to, be, used, to, allow, reliable, interconnecting, welds, to, be, made, differential, thermal, expansion, of, the, component, could, put, pressure, on, the, leads, of, the, components, and, the, pcb, traces, and, cause, mechanical, damage, as, was, seen, in, several, modules, on, the, apollo, program, additionally, components, located, in, the, interior, are, difficult, to, replace, some, versions, of, cordwood, construction, used, soldered, single, sided, pcbs, as, the, interconnection, method, as, pictured, allowing, the, use, of, normal, leaded, components, at, the, cost, of, being, difficult, to, remove, the, boards, or, replace, any, component, that, is, not, at, the, edge, before, the, advent, of, integrated, circuits, this, method, allowed, the, highest, possible, component, packing, density, because, of, this, it, was, used, by, a, number, of, computer, vendors, including, control, data, corporation, the, cordwood, method, of, construction, was, used, only, rarely, once, pcbs, became, widespread, mainly, in, aerospace, or, other, extremely, high, density, electronics, a, minimal, pcb, for, a, single, component, used, for, prototyping, is, called, a, breakout, board, the, purpose, of, a, breakout, board, is, to, break, out, the, leads, of, a, component, on, separate, terminals, so, that, manual, connections, to, them, can, be, made, easily, breakout, boards, are, especially, used, for, surface, mount, components, or, any, components, with, fine, lead, pitch, advanced, pcbs, may, contain, components, embedded, in, the, substrate, such, as, capacitors, and, integrated, circuits, to, reduce, the, amount, of, space, taken, up, by, components, on, the, surface, of, the, pcb, while, improving, electrical, characteristics, multiwire, is, a, patented, technique, of, interconnection, which, uses, machine, routed, insulated, wires, embedded, in, a, non, conducting, matrix, often, plastic, resin, it, was, used, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, as, of, 2010, multiwire, was, still, available, through, hitachi, since, it, was, quite, easy, to, stack, interconnections, wires, inside, the, embedding, matrix, the, approach, allowed, designers, to, forget, completely, about, the, routing, of, wires, usually, a, time, consuming, operation, of, pcb, design, anywhere, the, designer, needs, a, connection, the, machine, will, draw, a, wire, in, a, straight, line, from, one, location, pin, to, another, this, led, to, very, short, design, times, no, complex, algorithms, to, use, even, for, high, density, designs, as, well, as, reduced, crosstalk, which, is, worse, when, wires, run, parallel, to, each, other, which, almost, never, happens, in, multiwire, though, the, cost, is, too, high, to, compete, with, cheaper, pcb, technologies, when, large, quantities, are, needed, corrections, can, be, made, to, a, multiwire, board, layout, more, easily, than, to, a, pcb, layout, printed, circuit, boards, have, been, used, as, an, alternative, to, their, typical, use, for, electronic, and, biomedical, engineering, thanks, to, the, versatility, of, their, layers, especially, the, copper, layer, pcb, layers, have, been, used, to, fabricate, sensors, such, as, capacitive, pressure, sensors, and, accelerometers, actuators, such, as, microvalves, and, microheaters, as, well, as, platforms, of, sensors, and, actuators, for, lab, on, a, chip, loc, for, example, to, perform, polymerase, chain, reaction, pcr, and, fuel, cells, to, name, a, few, manufacturers, may, not, support, component, level, repair, of, printed, circuit, boards, because, of, the, relatively, low, cost, to, replace, compared, with, the, time, and, cost, of, troubleshooting, to, a, component, level, in, board, level, repair, the, technician, identifies, the, board, pca, on, which, the, fault, resides, and, replaces, it, this, shift, is, economically, efficient, from, a, manufacturer, s, point, of, view, but, is, also, materially, wasteful, as, a, circuit, board, with, hundreds, of, functional, components, may, be, discarded, and, replaced, due, to, the, failure, of, one, minor, and, inexpensive, part, such, as, a, resistor, or, capacitor, this, practice, is, a, significant, contributor, to, the, problem, of, e, waste, in, many, countries, including, all, european, single, market, participants, the, united, kingdom, turkey, and, china, legislation, restricts, the, use, of, lead, cadmium, and, mercury, in, electrical, equipment, pcbs, sold, in, such, countries, must, therefore, use, lead, free, manufacturing, processes, and, lead, free, solder, and, attached, components, must, themselves, be, compliant, safety, standard, ul, 796, covers, component, safety, requirements, for, printed, wiring, boards, for, use, as, components, in, devices, or, appliances, testing, analyzes, characteristics, such, as, flammability, maximum, operating, temperature, electrical, tracking, heat, deflection, and, direct, support, of, live, electrical, parts
