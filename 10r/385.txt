modelling, clay, or, modelling, compound, is, any, of, a, group, of, malleable, substances, used, in, building, and, sculpting, the, material, compositions, and, production, processes, vary, considerably, ceramic, clays, are, water, based, substances, made, from, clay, minerals, and, other, raw, materials, they, are, baked, at, high, temperatures, in, a, process, known, as, firing, to, create, ceramics, such, as, terra, cotta, earthenware, stoneware, and, porcelain, paper, clay, produced, by, pottery, clay, manufacturers, is, a, clay, body, to, which, a, small, percentage, of, processed, cellulose, fiber, has, been, added, when, kiln, fired, the, paper, burns, out, leaving, the, clay, body, consequently, the, firing, temperatures, and, glazes, selection, should, be, the, same, on, those, used, with, the, clay, body, oil, based, clays, are, made, from, combinations, of, oils, waxes, and, clay, minerals, unlike, water, the, oils, do, not, evaporate, and, oil, based, clays, remain, malleable, even, when, left, in, dry, environments, for, long, periods, articles, made, from, oil, based, clays, cannot, be, fired, and, thus, are, not, ceramics, because, rising, temperature, decreases, oil, viscosity, the, malleability, is, influenced, by, heating, or, cooling, the, clay, oil, based, clay, is, not, water, soluble, as, it, can, be, re, used, it, is, a, material, commonly, used, by, stop, motion, animators, who, need, to, bend, and, move, their, models, it, is, available, in, a, multitude, of, colors, and, is, non, toxic, readily, worked, in, fine, detail, oil, based, clays, are, also, suitable, for, the, creation, of, detailed, sculptures, from, which, molds, can, be, made, castings, and, reproductions, can, then, be, produced, from, much, more, durable, materials, cars, and, airplanes, may, be, created, using, industrial, design, grade, modelling, clay, oil, based, clays, are, referred, to, by, multiple, of, genericized, trademarks, polymer, clay, is, a, modelling, material, that, cures, when, heated, from, 129, to, 135, c, 265, to, 275, f, for, 15, minutes, per, 6, millimetres, 1, 4, in, of, thickness, and, does, not, significantly, shrink, or, change, shape, during, the, process, despite, being, called, clay, it, generally, contains, no, clay, minerals, polymer, clay, is, sold, in, craft, hobby, and, art, stores, and, is, used, by, artists, hobbyists, and, children, polymer, clay, is, used, in, animation, since, it, allows, static, forms, to, be, manipulated, frame, after, frame, leading, brands, of, polymer, clay, include, fimo, kato, polyclay, sculpey, modello, and, crafty, argentina, paper, clay, is, handmade, or, commercially, available, clay, to, which, a, small, percentage, of, processed, cellulose, fiber, is, added, the, fiber, increases, the, tensile, strength, of, the, dry, clay, and, enables, dry, to, dry, and, wet, to, dry, joins, commercial, paper, clays, air, dry, to, a, firm, lightweight, sculpture, with, minimal, shrinking, during, the, drying, process, paper, clay, can, be, used, as, an, unfired, body, in, craft, and, doll, making, it, is, used, in, ceramic, art, studios, as, sculptural, and, functional, studio, pottery
