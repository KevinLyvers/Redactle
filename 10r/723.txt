a, cargo, ship, or, freighter, is, a, merchant, ship, that, carries, cargo, goods, and, materials, from, one, port, to, another, thousands, of, cargo, carriers, ply, the, world, s, seas, and, oceans, each, year, handling, the, bulk, of, international, trade, cargo, ships, are, usually, specially, designed, for, the, task, often, being, equipped, with, cranes, and, other, mechanisms, to, load, and, unload, and, come, in, all, sizes, today, they, are, almost, always, built, of, welded, steel, and, with, some, exceptions, generally, have, a, life, expectancy, of, 25, to, 30, years, before, being, scrapped, the, words, cargo, and, freight, have, become, interchangeable, in, casual, usage, technically, cargo, refers, to, the, goods, carried, aboard, the, ship, for, hire, while, freight, refers, to, the, act, of, carrying, of, such, cargo, but, the, terms, have, been, used, interchangeably, for, centuries, generally, the, modern, ocean, shipping, business, is, divided, into, two, classes, larger, cargo, ships, are, generally, operated, by, shipping, lines, companies, that, specialize, in, the, handling, of, cargo, in, general, smaller, vessels, such, as, coasters, are, often, owned, by, their, operators, cargo, ships, freighters, can, be, divided, into, eight, groups, according, to, the, type, of, cargo, they, carry, these, groups, are, specialized, types, of, cargo, vessels, include, container, ships, and, bulk, carriers, technically, tankers, of, all, sizes, are, cargo, ships, although, they, are, routinely, thought, of, as, a, separate, category, cargo, ships, fall, into, two, further, categories, that, reflect, the, services, they, offer, to, industry, liner, and, tramp, services, those, on, a, fixed, published, schedule, and, fixed, tariff, rates, are, cargo, liners, tramp, ships, do, not, have, fixed, schedules, users, charter, them, to, haul, loads, generally, the, smaller, shipping, companies, and, private, individuals, operate, tramp, ships, cargo, liners, run, on, fixed, schedules, published, by, the, shipping, companies, each, trip, a, liner, takes, is, called, a, voyage, liners, mostly, carry, general, cargo, however, some, cargo, liners, may, carry, passengers, also, a, cargo, liner, that, carries, 12, or, more, passengers, is, called, a, combination, or, passenger, run, cargo, line, cargo, ships, are, categorized, partly, by, cargo, or, shipping, capacity, tonnage, partly, by, weight, deadweight, tonnage, dwt, and, partly, by, dimensions, maximum, dimensions, such, as, length, and, width, beam, limit, the, canal, locks, a, ship, can, fit, in, water, depth, draft, is, a, limitation, for, canals, shallow, straits, or, harbors, and, height, is, a, limitation, in, order, to, pass, under, bridges, common, categories, include, the, ti, class, supertanker, is, an, ultra, large, crude, carrier, with, a, draft, that, is, deeper, than, suezmax, malaccamax, and, neopanamax, this, causes, atlantic, pacific, routes, to, be, very, long, such, as, the, long, voyages, south, of, cape, of, good, hope, or, south, of, cape, horn, to, transit, between, atlantic, and, pacific, oceans, lake, freighters, built, for, the, great, lakes, in, north, america, differ, in, design, from, sea, water, going, ships, because, of, the, difference, in, wave, size, and, frequency, in, the, lakes, a, number, of, these, ships, are, larger, than, seawaymax, and, cannot, leave, the, lakes, and, pass, to, the, atlantic, ocean, since, they, do, not, fit, the, locks, on, the, saint, lawrence, seaway, the, earliest, records, of, waterborne, activity, mention, the, carriage, of, items, for, trade, the, evidence, of, history, and, archaeology, shows, the, practice, to, be, widespread, by, the, beginning, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, and, as, early, as, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, bc, small, mediterranean, cargo, ships, like, those, of, the, 50, foot, long, 15, 16, metre, uluburun, ship, were, carrying, 20, tons, of, exotic, cargo, 11, tons, of, raw, copper, jars, glass, ivory, gold, spices, and, treasures, from, canaan, greece, egypt, and, africa, the, desire, to, operate, trade, routes, over, longer, distances, and, throughout, more, seasons, of, the, year, motivated, improvements, in, ship, design, during, the, middle, ages, before, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, the, incidence, of, piracy, resulted, in, most, cargo, ships, being, armed, sometimes, quite, heavily, as, in, the, case, of, the, manila, galleons, and, east, indiamen, they, were, also, sometimes, escorted, by, warships, piracy, is, still, quite, common, in, some, waters, particularly, in, the, malacca, straits, a, narrow, channel, between, indonesia, and, singapore, malaysia, and, cargo, ships, are, still, commonly, targeted, in, 2004, the, governments, of, those, three, nations, agreed, to, provide, better, protection, for, the, ships, passing, through, the, straits, the, waters, off, somalia, and, nigeria, are, also, prone, to, piracy, while, smaller, vessels, are, also, in, danger, along, parts, of, the, south, american, coasts, southeast, asian, coasts, and, near, the, caribbean, sea, a, category, designation, appears,
